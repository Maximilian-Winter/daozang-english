Traditionally attributed to Zhuang Zhou of Song during the Warring States period, it is in fact a compendium of works by the Daoist school of Zhuang Zhou. In the Tang dynasty, it was revered as one of the Four True Scriptures of Daoism. The original text comprised fifty-two chapters; the present version, annotated by Guo Xiang of the Jin, contains thirty-three chapters, divided into five scrolls.\n\n**Source Text:** *Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Unity* (Dongshen section, *Benwen* category).\n**Collated Edition:** *Sibu Congkan* facsimile of the Ming-era Shide Hall printed edition (hereafter \"Shide edition\").\n\n**Table of Contents**\n\n**Scroll One**\n*Inner Chapters*\n1. \"Free and Easy Wandering\"\n2. \"The Equality of Things and Opinions\"\n3. \"The Secret of Caring for Life\"\n4. \"The World of Men\"\n5. \"The Sign of Virtue Complete\"\n\n**Scroll Two**\n*Inner Chapters*\n6. \"The Great and Venerable Teacher\"\n7. \"Fit for Emperors and Kings\"\n*Outer Chapters*\n8. \"Webbed Toes\"\n9. \"Horses’ Hooves\"\n10. \"The Floods of Autumn\"\n11. \"Letting Be and Exercising Forbearance\"\n\n**Scroll Three**\n*Outer Chapters*\n12. \"Heaven and Earth\"\n13. \"The Way of Heaven\"\n14. \"Heaven’s Revolutions\"\n15. \"Cutting Away the Carved Ornament\"\n16. \"Mending Nature\"\n17. \"Autumn Floods\"\n18. \"Perfect Happiness\"\n\n**Scroll Four**\n*Outer Chapters*\n19. \"Mastering Life\"\n20. \"The Mountain Trees\"\n21. \"Master Tian Zi Fang\"\n22. \"Knowledge Wandered North\"\n*Miscellaneous Chapters*\n23. \"Gengsang Chu\"\n24. \"Xu Wugui\"\n25. \"Ze Yang\"\n\n**Scroll Five**\n*Miscellaneous Chapters*\n26. \"External Things\"\n27. \"Parables\"\n28. \"Yielding the Throne\"\n29. \"Robber Zhi\"\n30. \"Discoursing on Swords\"\n31. \"The Old Fisherman\"\n32. \"Lie Yukou\"\n33. \"The World\"\n\nZhuangzi was a native of Song, named Zhou, styled You. He was born in Meng County of Suiyang. He once served as the warden of the Lacquer Garden in Meng. His learning left no field unexamined, but its essence returned to the words of Laozi. Thus, he composed a work of over a hundred thousand characters, most of which were parables. His words flowed boundlessly, following his own inclinations, so that even kings and nobles could not confine him. King Wei of Chu, hearing of Zhuangzi’s worth, sent envoys with generous gifts to invite him, offering the position of minister. Zhuangzi laughed and said to the envoys: \"A thousand gold pieces are a great profit; the rank of minister is a lofty position. Have you alone never seen the sacrificial ox at the suburban rites? Fed for years, adorned with embroidered trappings, it is led into the great temple. At that moment, if it wished to be a lone piglet, could it do so? Begone at once, and do not defile me. I would rather roam and play in the mire for my own delight than be fettered by rulers. I will never serve, that my will may remain free.\"\n\nDuring the Tang Dynasty, he was enfeoffed as the Perfected Man of Nanhua, and his book was titled *The True Classic of Nanhua*.\n\n**Inner Chapters**\n1. \"Free and Easy Wandering\"\nIn the Northern Darkness there is a fish, its name is Kun. The Kun’s greatness—no one knows how many thousand *li* it spans. It transforms into a bird, its name is Peng. The Peng’s back—no one knows how many thousand *li* it spans. When it rises in flight, its wings are like clouds hanging from the sky. This bird, when the sea stirs, will journey to the Southern Darkness. The Southern Darkness is the Heavenly Pond.\n\nThere is a man named Qi Xie, who records strange things. His words say: When the Peng journeys to the Southern Darkness, it strikes the water for three thousand *li*, then spirals upward on the whirlwind for ninety thousand *li*, departing on the sixth-month gale. Wild horses, dust motes, and living things are all blown about by the same breath. Is the deep blue of the sky its true color? Or is it so distant that it has no end? From its view below, it must be just the same.\n\nMoreover, when water is not deeply accumulated, it lacks the strength to bear a great vessel. Pour a cup of water onto a hollow in the hall’s floor, and a mustard seed becomes a boat for it; set the cup there and it sticks fast, for the water is shallow and the vessel large. When wind is not deeply accumulated, it lacks the strength to bear great wings. Thus, only when the wind lies beneath ninety thousand *li* can it be borne up; only then, riding the wind, back pressing against the blue sky without obstacle, can one at last set course for the south.\n\nThe cicada and the fledgling dove laugh at this, saying: \"We burst forth and fly, striking the elm and sandalwood, and when we cannot reach them, we simply settle back to earth—that is all. Why go ninety thousand *li* to journey south?\" To travel to the near wilderness, one returns after a morning’s meal with belly still full; to travel a hundred *li*, one must spend the night grinding grain; to travel a thousand *li*, one must gather provisions for three months. What do these two creatures know?\n\nSmall knowledge does not reach great knowledge; short years do not reach long years. How do we know this is so? The morning mushroom knows not the alternation of dusk and dawn; the summer cicada knows not spring and autumn—these are short-lived. South of Chu there is the *Mingling* tree, which takes five hundred years as its spring and five hundred years as its autumn; in high antiquity there was the *Dazhuang* tree, which took eight thousand years as its spring and eight thousand years as its autumn. Yet Pengzu alone is renowned today for his longevity—how pitiful that the multitude compares itself to him!\n\nThis is what Tang asked Ji about: North of the lands where no plants grow lies the Dark Sea, the Heavenly Pond. There is a fish there, several thousand *li* in breadth, though none knows its length—its name is Kun. There is a bird there, its name Peng, its back like Mount Tai, its wings like clouds hanging from the sky. It strikes the whirlwind and spirals upward ninety thousand *li*, cutting through the clouds and qi, pressing against the blue sky, then sets course for the south, bound for the Southern Darkness. The minnow scoffs at it, saying: \"Where is it going? I leap and soar, rising no more than a few fathoms before descending, wheeling among the mugwort and wormwood—this is the utmost of flight. Where is it going?\" This is the distinction between small and great.\n\nThus, those whose knowledge suffices for one office, whose conduct matches one village, whose virtue pleases one lord, or whose merit wins one state—they view themselves as this minnow does. Song Rongzi would merely laugh at them. Even if the whole world praised him, he would not be encouraged; even if the whole world blamed him, he would not be disheartened. He firmly distinguishes between inner and outer, clearly discerns the boundary of honor and disgrace—this is all. In his dealings with the world, he is not eager. Yet even he has not yet established himself.\n\nLiezi rode the wind and traveled, effortlessly graceful, returning after fifteen days. In his pursuit of good fortune, he was not eager. Though he thus avoided walking, he still depended on something. As for one who rides the constancy of Heaven and Earth, who harnesses the transformations of the six qi, and roams the boundless—what does he depend on? Therefore it is said: The Perfect One is without self; the Spirit Man is without achievement; the Sage is without name.\n\nYao offered the world to Xu You, saying: \"When the sun and moon have risen, yet the torch still burns—is it not difficult for its light to be seen? When timely rain has fallen, yet one still waters the fields—is it not labor in vain? You stand and the world is well-governed, yet I still occupy the throne. I see myself as lacking—please take the world.\" Xu You said: \"You govern the world, and the world is already well-governed. Were I to replace you, would I do it for the name? A name is but the guest of reality—would I become a guest? The wren nests in the deep forest, yet needs only a single branch; the mole drinks from the river, yet needs only a bellyful. Return, my lord—I have no use for the world. Even if the cook does not prepare the food, the master of ceremonies does not leap over the wine vessels and sacrificial stands to take his place.\"\n\nJian Wu said to Lian Shu: \"I heard words from Jie Yu—grand yet without measure, going yet not returning. I was alarmed and terrified by them, as if the Milky Way stretched endlessly, vast and distant, far from human concerns.\" Lian Shu said: \"What did he say?\" Jian Wu replied: \"On distant Mount Gushe, there dwells a spirit man. His skin is like ice and snow, his grace like that of a maiden. He eats no grain, but inhales the wind and drinks the dew. He rides the clouds and qi, drives flying dragons, and roams beyond the four seas. His spirit is concentrated, and he causes things to be free of blight so that the grain ripens. I consider this madness and do not believe it.\"\n\nLian Shu said: \"Indeed. The blind cannot partake in the spectacle of patterns and colors, nor the deaf in the sound of bells and drums. Is it only the body that may be deaf and blind? The mind, too, may suffer such afflictions. His words are like those spoken to a child. This man, this virtue of his—it spans the boundaries of the myriad things to make them one. The world may be consumed by chaos, yet who would trouble himself with the affairs of the realm? This man: nothing harms him. Though great floods reach the heavens, he does not drown; though severe drought melts metal and stone and scorches mountains, he does not feel the heat. The dust and chaff of the world are but the clay from which Yao and Shun were molded—who would deign to occupy himself with worldly matters?\n\nThe people of Song carried ceremonial caps to Yue, yet the Yue, with their shorn hair and tattooed bodies, had no use for them. Yao governed the people of the world and brought order to the realm, yet when he went to see the Four Masters on distant Mount Gushe, north of the Fen River, he was so overwhelmed that he forgot his empire entirely.\n\nHui Zi said to Zhuangzi: 'The King of Wei gave me seeds of a great gourd. I planted them, and they grew to bear fruit weighing five *dan*. When I used it to hold water, its strength was insufficient to support itself. When I split it to make a ladle, its size was so vast it could hold nothing. It is not that it was not impressively large—it was simply useless, so I discarded it.'\n\nZhuangzi replied: 'You are truly inept at putting great things to use. There was a man of Song skilled in making an ointment that prevented chapping. For generations, his family had made their living by fulling silk. A traveler heard of this and offered to buy the formula for a hundred pieces of gold. The family gathered to deliberate: \"For generations, we have fulling silk and earned no more than a few pieces of gold. Now, in a single morning, we can sell our craft for a hundred. Let us give it to him.\" The traveler acquired it and presented it to the King of Wu. When Yue raised a rebellion, the King of Wu sent him to lead his troops. In winter, they fought the Yue on the water and crushed them. The king then granted him a fiefdom. The ability to prevent chapping was the same, yet one man gained a fief while another remained a fuller of silk—the difference lay in how it was used. Now you have a gourd of five *dan*—why not consider making it into a great float and drifting upon the rivers and lakes, instead of fretting that its size leaves it with no place to hold anything? Your mind is still as tangled as a clump of weeds.'\n\nHui Zi said to Zhuangzi: 'I have a great tree, which people call the *chu*. Its trunk is so gnarled and swollen that it does not meet the carpenter’s line, and its branches are so twisted that they do not conform to compass or square. Though it stands by the roadside, no craftsman gives it a glance. Now your words are grand but useless—just as the world turns away from them.'\n\nZhuangzi replied: 'Have you never seen a wildcat? It crouches low to lie in wait, pouncing on whatever passes by. It leaps east and west, heedless of height or depth.'\"\n\n\"Trapped in snares and crushed by traps, it dies in nets and toils. Now take the yak: its size is like clouds trailing across the sky. This creature may be great, but it cannot catch mice. You have a great tree and worry that it is useless—why not plant it in the land of Nothing-Whatsoever, in the vast and boundless wilds? Wander idly by its side, roam free and recline beneath it. No axe will fell it, nothing will harm it, and it will have no use. Where then is your distress?\n\n---\n\nIn the second chapter, *On the Equality of Things*, Nan Guo Zi Qi leaned against his armrest and sat, gazing upward to exhale, lost in a trance as if he had forgotten his companion.\n\nYan Cheng Zi You stood in attendance before him and asked: 'What is this? Can the body truly be made like withered wood, and the mind like dead ashes? Yet the one who now leans against the armrest is not the same as the one who once did so.'\n\nZi Qi said: 'Yan, is it not well that you ask? Just now, I forgot myself—did you understand?'\"\n\n\"You have heard the human *lai*, but not the earthly *lai*; you have heard the earthly *lai*, but not the heavenly *lai*.\"\n\nYan Cheng Zi You said: \"May I ask the method?\"\n\nZi Qi said: \"The great clod breathes forth *qi*—its name is wind. This alone does nothing, but when it stirs, the myriad hollows roar and howl—have you alone not heard its ceaseless *shen-shen*? The towering forests and jagged peaks—great trees of a hundred spans, their hollows like noses, like mouths, like ears, like beams, like rings, like mortars, like pools, like pits. Some gush, some whistle, some shriek, some gasp, some wail, some bellow, some moan, some shriek—those ahead sing *yu*, those behind sing *yong*. A gentle breeze yields a faint harmony; a whirlwind yields a mighty harmony. When the raging wind subsides, all hollows fall silent. Have you alone not seen their trembling *diao-diao* and quivering *jiao-jiao*?\"\n\nZi You said: \"The earthly *lai* is simply the harmony of the myriad hollows; the human *lai* is merely the harmony of flutes. May I ask about the heavenly *lai*?\"\n\nZi Qi said: \"The wind blows in ten thousand ways, yet each moves of itself—all take their own form. What stirs them, if not the one who roars?\" The wisdom of the great is vast and unhurried; the knowledge of the petty is narrow and contentious. Grand words blaze and burn; petty words prattle and chatter.\"\n\nIn sleep, the soul intertwines; in waking, the form unfurls. Engaged with the world, we weave our bonds, daily waging war within the heart. Some drift aimlessly, some burrow deep, some cling in secrecy. Small fears leave us trembling; great fears unravel us entirely.\n\nTheir eruptions are like the release of a crossbow’s trigger—this is what we call the judgment of right and wrong. Their restraint is like a sworn oath—this is what we call the clinging to victory. Their decay is like autumn and winter, speaking of the daily erosion. Their drowning in habit cannot be reversed. Their weariness is like a sealed casket, speaking of the stagnation of age. The heart near death cannot be revived. Joy and anger, sorrow and delight, anxiety and sighing, fickleness and caprice, indulgence and abandon—these arise like music from the void, like mushrooms from the steam. Day and night they alternate before us, yet none know where they sprout.\n\nEnough, enough! If one could grasp this even at dusk, would it not be the very source of life? Without that, there is no self; without the self, there is nothing to grasp. This is close indeed, yet we know not what moves it. As if there were a true master, yet no trace of it can be found. It can act and be trusted, yet its form is unseen. It has essence but no shape.\n\nThe hundred bones, nine orifices, six viscera—all are complete within me. Which should I hold most dear? Do you delight in all of them equally? Or do you favor some? Are they all servants and maids? If servants and maids cannot govern one another, do they take turns as lord and subject? Or is there a true lord residing within? Whether one seeks to know its nature or not, it neither adds to nor diminishes the truth.\n\nOnce the formed shape is received, it does not perish until its end. It clashes and grinds against things, racing toward exhaustion like a galloping steed—yet nothing can halt it. Is this not lamentable? To toil a lifetime without seeing success, to wear oneself out in exhaustion without knowing one’s destination—how can this not be sorrowful? If one calls this not death, what good is it? The body transforms, the heart follows suit—can this not be called great sorrow?\n\nIs human life inherently so confused? Am I alone in my confusion, while others remain unconfused? If one follows the heart that has already taken shape and takes it as a teacher, who is without a teacher? Why must one know the cycles of change and let the heart choose for itself? Even fools possess this. To have right and wrong before the heart is fully formed is like setting out for Yue today and arriving yesterday. This is to take what does not exist as existent. To take what does not exist as existent—even the divine Yu could not comprehend it, so how can I?\n\nSpeech is not the wind’s breath. Those who speak have words, yet what they speak of remains unsettled. Is there truly speech? Or has there never been speech? Do they deem it different from the chirping of fledglings? Is there distinction, or is there none?\n\nWhere does the Dao hide that it has truth and falsehood? Where do words hide that they have right and wrong? Where does the Dao go that it ceases to exist? Where do words abide that they cannot be trusted? The Dao is obscured by minor achievements; words are obscured by florid embellishment. Thus arise the disputes of Confucians and Mohists, each affirming what the other denies and denying what the other affirms. To affirm what the other denies and deny what the other affirms, nothing surpasses clarity.\n\nNothing exists that is not \"that\"; nothing exists that is not \"this.\" From \"that,\" one does not see; from self-knowledge, one knows. Thus it is said: \"That\" emerges from \"this,\" and \"this\" likewise depends on \"that.\" \"That\" and \"this\" are born together in the same moment. Yet even as they are born, they die; even as they die, they are born. Even as something is deemed right, it is deemed wrong; even as it is deemed wrong, it is deemed right. Thus the sage does not proceed by this path but illuminates all by the light of Heaven—this too is \"that.\"\n\n\"This\" is also \"that,\" and \"that\" is also \"this.\" \"That\" has its own right and wrong, and \"this\" has its own right and wrong. Is there truly a distinction between \"that\" and \"this\"? Or is there no distinction? Where \"that\" and \"this\" find no opposition is called the pivot of the Dao. Once the pivot is grasped, it responds endlessly to the infinite transformations, where \"right\" is inexhaustible and \"wrong\" is likewise inexhaustible. Thus it is said: Nothing surpasses clarity.\n\nIs there truly a \"that\" and a \"this\"? Or is there no \"that\" and no \"this\"? Where \"that\" and \"this\" find no counterpart, this is called the pivot of the Dao. Once the pivot is grasped at the center of the ring, it responds to the boundless. \"Right\" is one boundlessness, and \"wrong\" is another boundlessness. Thus it is said: Nothing surpasses clarity.\n\nTo illustrate the finger’s non-fingerhood with a finger is not as good as illustrating the finger’s non-fingerhood with a non-finger. To illustrate the horse’s non-horsehood with a horse is not as good as illustrating the horse’s non-horsehood with a non-horse. Heaven and Earth are one finger; the myriad things are one horse.\n\nWhat is deemed right is right; what is deemed wrong is wrong. The Dao proceeds and thereby achieves; things name it and thereby affirm. How is it affirmed? Affirmed as affirmed. How is it not affirmed? Not affirmed as not affirmed. Things inherently have what they affirm; things inherently have what they deem right. There is nothing that is not affirmed; there is nothing that is not deemed right.\n\nThus, take the examples of the tumbleweed and the pillar, the hag and Xi Shi, the vast and the grotesque, the strange and the monstrous—through the Dao, all become one. Their division is their completion; their completion is their destruction. Yet for all things, there is no completion and no destruction, for they revert to becoming one.\n\nOnly those who comprehend this unity do not employ it but lodge it in the ordinary. The ordinary is function; function is penetration; penetration is attainment. Attainment is the moment of nearness. Following this, one ceases, yet does not know how it is so—this is called the Dao.\n\nTo exhaust the spirit in striving for unity while failing to recognize their sameness is called \"morning threes.\" What is \"morning threes\"? It is said: The monkey-keeper distributed chestnuts, saying, \"Three in the morning and four in the evening.\" The monkeys were all enraged. He then said, \"Very well, four in the morning and three in the evening.\" The monkeys were all pleased. The names and realities remained unchanged, yet joy and anger were employed—this too is following \"that.\"\n\nThus the sage harmonizes with right and wrong and rests in the equality of Heaven—this is called walking two paths. The ancients, their knowledge reached a certain point—how far did it reach?\n\nThere are those who hold that things have never yet begun to exist—this is the ultimate, the utmost, beyond which nothing can be added. Next are those who hold that things exist, yet boundaries have never yet arisen. Next are those who hold that boundaries exist, yet right and wrong have never yet appeared. The manifestation of right and wrong is what causes the Dao to be diminished. The diminishment of the Dao is what gives rise to partiality. Is there truly completion and diminishment? Or is there truly no completion and diminishment? If there were completion and diminishment, then Master Zhao’s zither-playing would be an example. If there were no completion and diminishment, then Master Zhao’s not playing the zither would be an example. Master Zhao’s zither-playing, Music Master Kuang’s wielding of his baton, and Master Hui’s leaning against the parasol tree—these three men’s knowledge approached subtlety. All were at their peak, and thus their deeds are recorded at life’s end. Yet because they were fond of these things, they set themselves apart from others; because they were fond of them, they sought to make them clear. But what they sought to clarify was not truly clarifiable, and so they ended in the obscurity of \"hard and white.\" And Master Zhao’s son, in turn, spent his life spinning the threads of his father’s art, yet achieved nothing. If this can be called achievement, then even I have achieved. If this cannot be called achievement, then neither things nor I have achieved. Thus, the dazzling confusion of doubt is what the sage contemplates. To refrain from using it while lodging it in the ordinary—this is called \"illuminating through non-use.\"\n\nNow, suppose I were to speak here: Would it be of the same kind as this? Or not of the same kind? Whether of the same kind or not, if they are taken together as kinds, then there is no difference from that. Nevertheless, let me try to speak of it. There is a beginning; there is a time before that beginning; there is a time before the time before that beginning. There is being; there is non-being; there is a time before non-being; there is a time before the time before non-being. Suddenly there is being and non-being, yet we do not know which of the two—being or non-being—is truly so. Now, I have already spoken, yet I do not know whether what I have spoken is truly speaking or truly not speaking.\n\nNothing in the world is greater than the tip of an autumn hair, yet Mount Tai is small. No one is longer-lived than a child who dies young, yet Pengzu died prematurely. Heaven and Earth were born together with me, and the myriad things and I are one. Since we are already one, can there be speech? Since I have already called it one, can there be no speech? One and speech make two; two and one make three. Proceeding from this, even the most skilled mathematician cannot arrive at a number, much less an ordinary person. Thus, from non-being to being, we reach three—how much more so from being to being! Do not proceed; follow this.\n\nThe Dao has never had boundaries; speech has never had constancy. It is for the sake of \"this\" that there are disputes. Let me speak of these disputes: There is left and right, there are ranks and principles, there are divisions and distinctions, there are competition and contention—these are called the eight virtues. Beyond the six directions, the sage acknowledges but does not discuss; within the six directions, the sage discusses but does not debate. The *Spring and Autumn Annals* and the chronicles of former kings’ reigns—the sage debates but does not argue. Thus, division implies what is not divided; distinction implies what is not distinguished. Why is this? The sage embraces it, while the multitude debates it to display to one another. Thus it is said: Those who debate do so because they do not see.\n\nThe great Dao is not named; great disputation does not speak; great benevolence is not benevolent; great integrity is not frugal; great courage is not aggressive. The Dao that is manifest is not the Dao; speech that debates does not reach; benevolence that is constant does not accomplish; integrity that is pure is not trustworthy; courage that relies on skill does not succeed. These five, though rounded, nearly tend toward the square. Thus, to know where to stop in what one does not know—this is the utmost. Who knows the disputation of no-speech, the Dao of no-Dao? If one could know it, this would be called the \"Heavenly Storehouse.\" It can be drawn from without ever being filled, and ladled from without ever being exhausted, yet one does not know its source—this is called \"preserving the light.\"\n\nThus, in ancient times, Yao asked Shun: \"I wish to attack Zong, Kuai, and Xu’ao. When I sit facing south, I feel uneasy. What is the reason?\" Shun said: \"Those three rulers dwell among the weeds and brambles. Why do you feel uneasy? Long ago, ten suns rose together, and the myriad things were all illuminated—how much more so the virtue that surpasses the sun!\"\n\nNie Que asked Wang Ni: \"Do you know what things all agree upon as right?\" Wang Ni said: \"How would I know?\" \"Do you know what you do not know?\" \"How would I know?\" \"Then do things have no knowledge?\" \"How would I know? Nevertheless, let me try to speak of it. How do I know that what I call knowing is not not-knowing? How do I know that what I call not-knowing is not knowing? Moreover, let me ask you this: If people sleep in damp places, their waists will ache and they will be half-paralyzed—is that so for an eel? If they live in trees, they will tremble with fear—is that so for a monkey? Of these three, which knows the proper place to dwell? People eat the flesh of grass-fed and grain-fed animals; deer eat grass; centipedes delight in snakes; owls and crows relish mice. Of these four, which knows the proper taste? Monkeys mate with monkeys, deer consort with deer, eels swim with fish. Mao Qiang and Li Ji were considered beautiful by people, but when fish saw them, they dove deep; when birds saw them, they flew high; when deer saw them, they dashed away. Of these four, which knows the proper beauty of the world? From my perspective, the beginnings of benevolence and righteousness, the paths of right and wrong, are tangled and confused—how could I know how to distinguish them?\"\n\nNie Que said: \"If you do not know benefit and harm, then does the perfected person truly not know benefit and harm?\" Wang Ni said: \"The perfected person is spirit-like. If great marshes burned, they could not be hot; if the Yellow River and Han River froze, they could not be cold; if swift thunder split mountains and winds shook the sea, they could not be startled. One like this rides the clouds and mist, mounts the sun and moon, and roams beyond the four seas.\"\n\nDeath and life bring no change to oneself—how could they be the beginnings of benefit and harm?\n\nMaster Juque asked Master Changwu: \"I have heard from the Master that the sage does not engage in worldly affairs, does not pursue profit, does not avoid harm, does not delight in seeking, does not follow the Dao/Way. Without words, there are words; with words, there are no words—and thus roams beyond the dust and grime. The Master considered this reckless speech, but I regard it as the practice of the wondrous Dao/Way. What do you think?\"\n\nMaster Changwu said: \"This is what the Yellow Emperor found enlightening to hear. Yet how could Confucius (Qiu) be sufficient to understand it? Moreover, you are far too hasty in your calculations—seeing the dawn and demanding the night, seeing the slingshot and craving the roasted crow. I have spoken to you idly; you have listened idly. Why cling to sun and moon, embrace the cosmos? For its harmony and union, set aside its confusion and chaos, and serve as equals in mutual respect. The masses toil; the sage appears foolish and dull. Through the myriad ages, all becomes one pure whole. All things are thus, and in this they are mutually enfolded.\n\nHow do you know that delight in life is not delusion? How do you know that aversion to death is not like one who has lost his way and does not know how to return? Lady Li was the daughter of the border warden of Ai. When the state of Jin first obtained her, she wept until her robes were soaked. Yet once she arrived at the king’s palace, shared his bed and ate fine meats, she regretted her tears. How do I know that the dead do not regret their former clinging to life?\n\nOne who dreams of drinking wine may weep at dawn; one who dreams of weeping may go hunting at sunrise. In the midst of the dream, one does not know it is a dream. Within the dream, one may even interpret the dream—only upon waking does one know it was a dream. And only with great awakening does one realize that all this was a great dream. Yet fools believe themselves awake, arrogantly claiming to know. Lords! Shepherds! How rigid they are! Confucius (Qiu) and you—we are all dreaming. When I say you are dreaming, I too am dreaming. Such words are called ‘uncanny.’ Even after ten thousand generations, should a great sage appear who understands their meaning, it would be as if we had met him at dawn or dusk.\n\nSuppose you and I were to debate: if you defeat me, and I do not defeat you, does that mean you are truly right and I am truly wrong? If I defeat you, and you do not defeat me, does that mean I am truly right and you are truly wrong? Is one of us right and the other wrong? Are both of us right or both wrong? You and I cannot know, and others are surely as confused. Whom shall we ask to decide? If we ask someone who agrees with you, how can he decide since he already agrees with you? If we ask someone who agrees with me, how can he decide since he already agrees with me? If we ask someone who differs from both of us, how can he decide since he differs from both of us? If we ask someone who agrees with both of us, how can he decide since he agrees with both of us? Thus, you, I, and others cannot know—must we wait for another?\n\nWhat does it mean to harmonize with the heavenly equality? It means: ‘Is’ or ‘is not,’ ‘so’ or ‘not so.’ If ‘is’ is truly ‘is,’ then the difference between ‘is’ and ‘is not’ requires no debate. If ‘so’ is truly ‘so,’ then the difference between ‘so’ and ‘not so’ requires no debate. The mutual dependence of changing voices—if they did not depend on one another—would be harmonized by the heavenly equality, carried along by the boundless, and thus one could live out one’s years. Forgetting years, forgetting righteousness, one is stirred by the boundless and thus abides in the boundless.\n\nWang Liang asked Qi: \"In the past, you walked—now you stop. In the past, you sat—now you rise. Why are you so without constancy?\"\n\nQi said: \"I act as I must—is that it? What I must do also depends on something else—is that it? Do I depend on the snake’s scales or the cicada’s wings? How do I know why it is so? How do I know why it is not so?\"\n\nOnce, Zhuang Zhou dreamed he was a butterfly—fluttering and joyous, a true butterfly! He was content, following his own will. He did not know he was Zhou. Suddenly he awoke, and there he was, solidly Zhou. Did Zhou dream he was a butterfly, or did the butterfly dream it was Zhou? Between Zhou and the butterfly, there must be a distinction. This is called the transformation of things.\n\n**Inner Chapters, \"The Secret of Caring for Life,\" Chapter Three**\n\nOur lives are bounded, yet knowledge is boundless. To strive with the bounded after the boundless is perilous. And to strive thus as one who knows is perilous indeed. In doing good, avoid proximity to fame; in doing evil, avoid proximity to punishment. Follow the central course as your constant guide—thus may you preserve your body, fulfill your life, nurture your kin, and live out your years.\n\nCook Ding carved an ox for Lord Wenhui. Where his hand touched, where his shoulder leaned, where his foot pressed, where his knee braced—*hua!*—the skin parted, the blade sang, never missing the rhythm, harmonizing with the *Sanglin* dance, attaining the *Jingshou* melody.\n\nLord Wenhui exclaimed: \"Ah! How excellent! Has skill truly reached such heights?\"\n\nCook Ding set down his knife and replied: \"What your servant loves is the Dao—it has advanced beyond mere skill. When I first began carving oxen, all I saw was the ox. After three years, I no longer saw the whole ox. Now, I meet it with my spirit rather than my eyes; my senses cease, and my spirit moves. I follow the natural grain, cleave through the great gaps, guide the blade through the great cavities, all according to its inherent pattern. I never touch the ligaments or tendons, much less the solid bone. A good cook changes his knife every year—it is worn from cutting. A mediocre cook changes his knife every month—it is broken from hacking. This knife of mine has lasted nineteen years, carving thousands of oxen, yet its edge is as if newly whetted. The joints have spaces, but the blade has no thickness. With what has no thickness entering where there is space, there is surely ample room for the blade to move—this is why after nineteen years, its edge is as if newly whetted. Still, whenever I come to a complex joint, I see the difficulty, pause in caution, focus my gaze, slow my movement, and move the blade with utmost care. Then—*tiao!*—it falls apart like earth crumbling to the ground. I stand holding the knife, look around in satisfaction, wipe it clean, and put it away.\"\n\nLord Wenhui said: \"Excellent! I have heard the words of Cook Ding and learned the secret of caring for life.\"\n\nGongwen Xuan saw the Right Master and exclaimed in surprise: \"What sort of man is this? Why is he one-legged? Was it heaven, or was it man?\"\n\nThe Right Master said: \"It is heaven, not man. Heaven’s creation made him thus unique; man’s form is meant to have symmetry. This is why it is attributed to heaven, not man. A marsh pheasant takes ten steps to peck, a hundred steps to drink, yet it does not wish to be fed in a cage. Though its spirit would flourish, it would not be well.\n\nWhen Lao Dan died, Qin Shi went to offer condolences. He wailed three times and left. A disciple asked: 'Was he not your master’s friend?' He replied: 'Yes.' 'Then is it proper to offer condolences in this way?' He said: 'Yes. At first, I thought he was a man of the Dao, but now I see he was not. When I entered to offer condolences just now, I saw old men weeping for him as if for their own sons, and young men weeping for him as if for their own mothers. In their gathering, there must have been those who wept without being compelled to weep. This is fleeing from heaven and betraying one’s nature—what the ancients called the punishment of fleeing from heaven. When he came, it was his time; when he departed, he followed the natural course. Abiding in the right time and following the natural course, sorrow and joy cannot enter. The ancients called this the supreme release from the bonds of the Lord.\n\nAs the fuel is exhausted, the fire is passed on, and its end is unknown.\"\n\n---\n\n*Chapter Four: The Secret of Caring for Life*\n\nYan Hui saw Confucius and asked to go on a mission. \"Where to?\" asked Confucius. \"I will go to Wei.\" \"What will you do there?\"\n\nYan Hui said, \"I have heard that the Lord of Wei is in his prime, yet his conduct is willful. He treats the lives of his people lightly, and the dead in his state are measured by marshlands as if they were hemp—his people have nowhere to turn. I once heard from you, Master, that one should leave a well-ordered state and go to a disordered one, for a physician’s gate is crowded with the sick. I wish to apply what I have heard to ponder its principles, hoping that his state might yet be saved.\"\n\nConfucius said, \"Alas! You will likely go only to be punished. The Dao does not tolerate杂乱;杂乱 leads to excess, excess to disturbance, disturbance to sorrow, and sorrow cannot be remedied. The perfected of old first established it within themselves before establishing it in others. If what is established within oneself is not yet settled, how can one attend to the conduct of a violent ruler?\n\n\"Do you also know whence virtue’s dissipation and knowledge’s emergence arise? Virtue dissipates into fame, and knowledge emerges from contention. Fame is a means of mutual oppression; knowledge is an instrument of contention. Both are inauspicious tools, not to be fully enacted. Moreover, one whose virtue is profound and whose sincerity is proven may not yet penetrate the people’s *qi*; one whose fame is widespread and who does not contend may not yet reach the people’s hearts. To forcefully present the language of仁义 and the carpenter’s墨 before a violent ruler is to make others resent what they themselves possess as beauty—this is called ‘sowing resentment.’ One who sows resentment will surely be resented in return. Are you not then sowing resentment for others?\n\n\"If you merely delight in the worthy and despise the unworthy, what need is there to seek distinction? If you do not issue commands, the lords will surely exploit others to vie for advantage. Your eyes will be dazzled, your countenance smoothed, your mouth will flatter, your demeanor will conform, and your heart will comply. This is like extinguishing fire with fire or flooding with water—it is called ‘adding to the excess.’ To follow such a beginning without end is to risk, with insincere grand words, certain death before a violent ruler.\n\n\"In ancient times, Jie killed Guan Longfeng, and Zhou killed Prince Bigan—both were men who cultivated themselves to humble the people and opposed their superiors. Thus, their lords used their cultivation to cast them out. These were lovers of fame. Formerly, Yao attacked Congzhi and Xu’ao, and Yu attacked Youhu. Their states became wastelands, their persons executed. Their use of arms did not cease, their pursuit of substance knew no end. These were seekers of fame and substance. Have you alone not heard of this? Fame and substance are what even the sages cannot overcome—how much less can you?\n\n\"Nevertheless, if you must have a way, come and tell me.\"\n\nYan Hui said, \"If I am upright yet empty, diligent yet single-minded, will that suffice?\"\n\nConfucius said, \"Alas, how could it? One who is full of yang, brash and ostentatious, whose colors shift unpredictably, is not one whom ordinary people can oppose. To follow others’ impulses in seeking to please their hearts is called ‘daily accumulating virtue that never forms’—how much less can great virtue be achieved? To cling rigidly without transformation, to conform outwardly while inwardly undervaluing, how could that ever suffice?\n\n\"Then let me be inwardly straight yet outwardly yielding, achieving while aligning with the ancients. To be inwardly straight is to follow Heaven. One who follows Heaven knows that the Son of Heaven and oneself are both children of Heaven. Why should one alone take credit when others praise one’s words, or blame when they do not? Such a one is called a child—this is what it means to follow Heaven. To be outwardly yielding is to follow others. Bowing the head and bending the knees are the rites of a minister. If all do so, how dare I not? To do what others do is to incur no blame—this is what it means to follow others. To achieve while aligning with the ancients is to follow antiquity. Though one’s words may instruct, they are but borrowed from reality. What antiquity possessed is not what I possess. Such a one, though straight, is not reproached—this is what it means to follow antiquity. Would this suffice?\"\n\nConfucius said, \"Alas, how could it? With too many policies and laws, though one may be steadfast, one remains blameless. Yet this is all there is to it—how can it lead to transformation? You are still guided by your own mind.\"\n\nYan Hui said, \"I have no further progress to make. May I ask the method?\"\n\nConfucius said, \"Fast! I will tell you. To act while possessing—is that easy? Those who find it easy are not favored by luminous Heaven.\"\n\nYan Hui said, \"My family is poor. For months now, I have neither drunk wine nor eaten meat. Would this suffice as fasting?\"\n\nConfucius replied, \"That is the fasting for ancestral sacrifices, not the fasting of the mind.\"\n\nYan Hui asked, \"May I inquire about the fasting of the mind?\"\n\nConfucius said, \"Unify your will. Do not listen with the ears but listen with the mind. Do not listen with the mind but listen with qi. Listening stops at the ears; the mind stops at mere correspondence. Qi is what is empty and awaits things. Only the Dao gathers in emptiness. Emptiness is the fasting of the mind.\"\n\nYan Hui said, \"Before I was instructed, I was truly myself. Once instructed, it is as though I no longer exist. Can this be called emptiness?\"\n\nConfucius said, \"You have grasped it fully. Let me tell you: If you can enter and wander within its bounds without being moved by reputation, respond when moved, and cease when not—this is near perfection. To sever ties with the near is easy; to walk without treading the earth is difficult. To be employed by others is easy to feign; to be employed by Heaven is difficult to feign. One has heard of flying with wings, but never of flying without wings; one has heard of knowing with knowledge, but never of knowing without knowledge. Look upon that emptiness—where the empty chamber generates brightness, and auspiciousness comes to rest. If one does not come to rest, this is called sitting while galloping. To follow the ears and eyes while inwardly communicating but outwardly cutting off the mind’s knowledge—even spirits and gods will come to dwell, let alone men. This is the transformation of the myriad things, the pivot of Yu and Shun, the ultimate path of Fuxi and the near-perfected—how much more so for those who are scattered?\n\nWhen Viscount Gaoyang of Ye was about to be sent as an envoy to Qi, he asked Confucius, 'The king’s charge to me is most weighty. The Qi court treats envoys with great respect but does not hasten to match their rank. Even a common man cannot be swayed—how much less a feudal lord? I am deeply apprehensive. You once told me: In all affairs, whether great or small, few succeed without following the Dao to achieve harmony. If the affair does not succeed, one must face the calamities of human relations; if it does succeed, one must face the calamities of yin and yang. Only one of power can succeed or fail without harm. I eat coarse food and do not seek refinement, yet I am one who desires no cooling. Now, upon receiving my charge this morning, I drink ice by evening—am I not inwardly burning? Before I have even reached the truth of the matter, I already face the calamities of yin and yang. If the affair does not succeed, I must face the calamities of human relations. These two outcomes are beyond what a minister can bear. Pray, instruct me further.'\n\nConfucius said, 'Under Heaven there are two great precepts: one is fate, the other is duty. A child’s love for parents is fate—it cannot be untied from the heart. A minister’s service to his lord is duty—there is no place between Heaven and Earth where it does not apply. These are the great precepts. Thus, in serving one’s parents, one finds peace without choosing the place—this is the utmost of filial piety. In serving one’s lord, one finds peace without choosing the task—this is the height of loyalty. In serving one’s own mind, to remain unmoved by joy or sorrow before what lies ahead, to know what cannot be helped and find peace in it as fate—this is the utmost of power. As a minister and child, one is fundamentally bound by what cannot be avoided. To act according to the truth of affairs while forgetting oneself—how could one have leisure to delight in life and fear death? Your conduct, sir, is exemplary.\n\nLet me repeat what I have heard: In close dealings, one must be worn smooth by trust; in distant dealings, one must be loyal in speech, for speech may be transmitted. Transmitting words of mutual joy or mutual anger is the most difficult thing in the world. Where there is mutual joy, there is much exaggerated praise; where there is mutual anger, there is much exaggerated slander. All exaggeration is falsehood; falsehood destroys trust, and the destruction of trust brings calamity to the transmitter. Thus, the standard teaching says: Transmit the constant truth, do not transmit exaggerated words—then you will be near to wholeness.\n\nMoreover, those who contend with skill and force begin in brightness but often end in darkness; when excess prevails, there is much cunning. Those who drink wine with ritual begin in order but often end in chaos; when excess prevails, there is much strange delight. All affairs are like this: they begin in good faith but often end in baseness. What starts simply will surely become vast. Words are like wind and waves; actions are like gain and loss. Wind and waves are easily stirred; gain and loss are easily endangered. Thus, anger arises without cause, and clever words lead to biased speech. When beasts die, they do not choose their cries; their gasping breath is desperate, and from this arises a heart of cruelty. When scrutiny is too severe, there will surely be an unworthy heart to respond, though one does not know why. If one does not know why, who can know how it will end? Thus, the standard teaching says: Do not alter commands, do not urge completion—excess leads to transgression. Altering commands and urging completion endanger affairs. Beauty is achieved in duration; evil, once done, cannot be undone. Can one not be cautious?\n\nTo ride things with a wandering mind, to entrust oneself to the unavoidable to nurture the center—this is perfection. What need is there for action in return? It is best to convey the charge faithfully—this is the difficult part.'\n\nYan Wei was about to be sent to transmit the heir apparent of Duke Ling of Wei. He asked Lian Boyu, 'There is a man here whose power is Heaven’s executioner. To deal with him without method endangers our state; to deal with him with method endangers myself.'\"\n\n\"His knowledge suffices only to recognize others’ faults but not their causes. In such a case, what should I do?\"\n\nLian Boyu replied, \"Excellent question! Be vigilant, be cautious—rectify yourself first. In form, nothing surpasses compliance; in heart, nothing surpasses harmony. Yet even these two have their perils. Compliance must not become submission, nor harmony projection. If form submits, you risk ruin, destruction, collapse, or downfall. If the heart projects, you risk reputation, fame, calamity, or misfortune.\n\nIf he acts like a child, join him as a child. If he acts without boundaries, join him without boundaries. If he acts without limits, join him without limits. By thus attaining harmony, you enter flawlessness.\n\nDo you not know the mantis? It brandished its arms to block the chariot wheel, unaware of its own incapacity—such was the beauty of its talent. Beware, be cautious. To accumulate praise and beauty while provoking him is perilously close.\n\nDo you not know the tiger-keeper? He dares not feed it living prey, lest its killing rage be aroused; nor whole prey, lest its tearing rage be provoked. He times its hunger and satiety, understanding its angry heart. Though tiger and man are of different kinds, the tiger fawns on its keeper—this is compliance. Thus, those it kills are those who resist.\n\nThe horse-lover uses a basket for dung and a gourd for urine. Yet when a mosquito or fly lands, and the groom fails to brush it away in time, the horse may break its bit, smash its head, or shatter its chest. Love may reach extremes where care is lost—can one not be cautious?\n\nCarpenter Shi traveled to Qi and reached Quyuan, where he saw a community altar tree. Its girth could shade an ox, its trunk spanned a hundred spans, its height towered over the mountains, and its branches began only at eighty feet. A dozen of its side branches could serve as boats. The crowd of onlookers was like a marketplace, yet the master carpenter did not glance at it, walking past without pause.\n\nHis disciple, having feasted his eyes, caught up to Carpenter Shi and said, 'Since I took up the axe to follow you, master, I have never seen timber so magnificent. Why did you not even look, walking past without stopping?'\n\n'Enough,' he replied. 'Say no more.'\"\n\nA useless tree—if made into a boat, it would sink; if made into a coffin, it would rot swiftly; if made into vessels, they would break quickly; if used for doors, it would ooze sap; if planted as a tree, it would be devoured by worms. This is a timber of no worth, utterly unusable, and thus it attains such longevity.\n\nCarpenter Shi returned home, and the altar tree appeared to him in a dream, saying: \"With what would you compare me? Would you liken me to the so-called 'fine timber'? Consider the crabapple, pear, orange, pomelo, and other fruit-bearing trees: when their fruits ripen, they are plucked and shamed; their great branches are broken, their small branches stripped. This is how their usefulness brings suffering to their lives, so they do not live out their natural years but perish midway, struck down by the world’s demands. All things are like this. As for me, I have long sought to be of no use, and only now, nearing death, have I attained it—this is my great usefulness. Had you been of use, could you have grown so vast? Moreover, you and I are both things—why judge one another as things? And you, a dying man of no worth, what could you know of a useless tree?\"\n\nCarpenter Shi awoke and pondered his dream. His disciple asked: \"If it sought uselessness, why serve as a community altar?\" He replied: \"Hush, say no more. It merely lodges there, enduring the scorn of those who do not understand it. Were it not an altar tree, it would long since have been felled. Yet what it preserves differs from the common, and to praise it with conventional standards—is that not far off the mark?\"\n\nMaster Nanbo Zijing was wandering in the hills of Shang when he saw an extraordinary tree. A thousand four-horse chariots could shelter beneath it, its shade concealing all they carried. Ziyu said: \"What tree is this? It must possess rare timber!\" Looking up at its slender branches, he saw they were gnarled and unfit for beams or rafters; looking down at its great roots, he saw they were split and useless for coffins. Chewing its leaves, his mouth blistered and burned; inhaling its scent, he became drunk and delirious for three days without respite. Ziyu said: \"This is truly a useless tree, and thus it has grown so vast. Alas, the spirit-like man—such is his uselessness!\"\n\nIn Song there was a family named Ke who tended catalpa, cypress, and mulberry trees. Those of arm’s span or less, sought for monkey perches, were felled; those of three or four spans, sought for grand and ornate halls, were felled; those of seven or eight spans, sought by wealthy nobles and merchants for beams and pillars, were felled. Thus they did not live out their natural years but perished midway under the axe—this is the calamity of usefulness. Therefore, the white-foreheaded ox, the upturned-snouted pig, and the man with hemorrhoids are deemed unfit to cross the river. The shamans and priests know this well—these are what they call inauspicious. Yet this is precisely what the spirit-like man calls most auspicious.\n\nThere was a man named Zhili Shu whose chin nestled in his navel, shoulders rose above his crown, the nape of his neck pointed to the sky, his five viscera sat atop his frame, and his two thighs pressed against his ribs. Sewing and washing he did, enough to fill his mouth; sifting chaff and winnowing grain, enough to feed ten men. When the ruler conscripted soldiers, Zhili Shu waved his arms among the crowds; when the ruler called for labor, Zhili Shu, citing his chronic ailment, was exempt from service. When the ruler distributed grain to the infirm, he received three bushels and ten bundles of firewood. One whose form was so disjointed could still nourish his body and live out his natural years—how much more so one whose virtue is thus disjointed?\n\nConfucius traveled to Chu, and Jie Yu, the madman of Chu, wandered to his gate, singing:\n*\"Phoenix! Phoenix!\nHow your virtue has waned!\nThe age to come cannot be awaited,\nThe age gone by cannot be pursued.\nWhen the world follows the Dao, the sage achieves;\nWhen the world loses the Dao, the sage survives.\nIn this present time, one barely escapes punishment.\nBlessing is lighter than a feather, yet none know how to bear it;\nCalamity is heavier than the earth, yet none know how to avoid it.\nEnough! Enough!\nTo approach others with virtue!\nPerilous! Perilous!\nTo tread where lines are drawn.\nBeware the brambles! Beware the brambles!\nLet them not harm my path.\nMy path winds and turns—\nLet them not harm my feet.\"*\n\nMountain trees bring ruin upon themselves; fat in the flame consumes itself. Cinnamon is edible, so it is felled; lacquer is useful, so it is slashed. All know the usefulness of the useful, yet none know the usefulness of the useless.\n\n**Chapter Five: Signs of Full Virtue**\n\nIn Lu there was a man named Wang Fu, who had lost his feet. Those who followed him were as numerous as those who followed Confucius. Chang Ji asked Confucius, \"Wang Fu is a man without feet, yet those who follow him divide Lu equally with you. He stands without teaching, sits without discussing; yet those who go to him empty return full.\"\n\nIs there not indeed a teaching without words, a shaping of the heart without form? What manner of man is this?\n\nConfucius said, \"This Master is a sage. I am but a latecomer who has yet to follow him. I shall take him as my teacher—how much more should those who are not my equal! Why limit ourselves to Lu? I shall lead all under Heaven to follow him.\"\n\nChang Ji said, \"He is a man without feet, yet he surpasses even a king. How far he stands above the common! If this is so, how does he employ his mind?\"\n\nConfucius said, \"Life and death are great matters, yet they do not alter him. Though heaven and earth should collapse, he would not be lost with them. He examines what is without artifice and does not shift with things. He governs the transformations of things while holding fast to their root.\"\n\nChang Ji said, \"What do you mean?\"\n\nConfucius said, \"Viewed from what makes them different, the liver and gallbladder are as distant as Chu and Yue. Viewed from what makes them the same, the myriad things are all one. One who is thus does not know what the ears and eyes deem fitting but roams the mind in the harmony of virtue. He sees what unites things and does not see what they lose. To him, the loss of a foot is like the shedding of dust.\"\n\nChang Ji said, \"He cultivates himself through his understanding, attains his heart through his heart. Having attained his constant heart, why do things gather to him?\"\n\nConfucius said, \"Men do not mirror themselves in flowing water but in still water. Only stillness can still the many. Endowed by earth, only the pine and cypress remain green in winter and summer. Endowed by heaven, only Shun was upright. Fortunate to have upright life, he set others upright. The proof of preserving the beginning lies in fearlessness. A single brave warrior can charge into nine armies. Those who seek fame and bind themselves to it are like this—how much more one who governs heaven and earth, stores the myriad things, treats the six senses as mere lodging, takes the ears and eyes as mere images, unifies knowledge with what is known, and whose heart never dies! He will choose a day to ascend to the heights, and men will follow him. How could he deign to make things his concern?\"\n\nShentu Jia, a man without feet, studied with Zheng Zichan under Bohun Wuren. Zichan said to Shentu Jia, \"If I go out first, you stay; if you go out first, I will stay.\" The next day, they again sat together in the same hall. Zichan said to Shentu Jia, \"If I go out first, you stay; if you go out first, I will stay. Now I am about to go out—can you stay, or not? Moreover, when you see the one in power, you do not avoid him. Do you consider yourself his equal?\"\n\nShentu Jia said, \"In the Master’s gate, are there truly those in power like this? Do you delight in your position of power and look down on others? I have heard that when a mirror is bright, dust does not settle; if it settles, it is not bright. When one dwells long with the worthy, one commits no faults. Now, what you value most is the Master, yet you still speak like this—is this not a fault?\"\n\nZichan said, \"You are already like this, yet you still vie with Yao in goodness. Do you not reflect that your virtue is insufficient?\"\n\nShentu Jia said, \"Those who justify their faults and claim they should not have lost are many; those who do not justify their faults and yet should not have perished are few. Knowing one cannot help but accept fate, only those with virtue can do so. Roaming within Yi’s bow casing, the center is the center of the earth, yet one may still miss—this is fate. Many are those with whole feet who laugh at my lack of feet. I would have raged, but when I came to the Master’s place, I was cast down and returned. Did the Master not wash me with goodness? I have followed you for nineteen years and never knew I was a man without feet. Now you roam with me within the form, yet you seek me outside the form—is this not a fault?\"\n\nZichan, startled, changed his expression and said, \"Say no more.\"\n\nIn Lu there was a man without toes named Shushan Wuzhi, who came to see Confucius on his heels. Confucius said, \"You were not careful and have already suffered such misfortune. Though you come now, what can be done?\"\n\nWuzhi said, \"I was ignorant of my duties and carelessly used my body, which is why I lost my foot. Now I come because what is more honorable than the foot still remains, and I strive to preserve it. Heaven covers all without exception; earth bears all without exception. I took you, Master, to be heaven and earth—how could I have known you would be like this?\"\n\nConfucius said, \"I am indeed narrow-minded. Why do you not enter? Let me expound what I have heard.\"\n\nWuzhi departed. Confucius said to his disciples, \"Strive! This Wuzhi, a man without feet, still strives to learn to make up for his past misdeeds—how much more should a man of full virtue!\"\n\nWuzhi said to Lao Dan, \"Is Confucius not far from the perfect man? Why does he persistently take learning as his guest? He seeks to be known for strange and fantastical fame, unaware that the perfect man regards this as fetters and shackles.\"\n\nLao Dan said, \"Why not simply lead him to see life and death as a single thread, the permissible and impermissible as one continuum, and thus free him from his fetters? Would that not suffice?\"\n\nWuzhi said, \"Heaven has punished him—how can it be undone?\"\n\nDuke Ai of Lu asked Confucius, \"In Wei there is an ugly man named Jifu Tuo. Men who live with him grow attached and cannot leave. Women who see him beg their parents, saying, ‘Rather than be another man’s wife, I would be this man’s concubine’—there are more than ten such cases. He never initiates speech but always harmonizes with others. He holds no lordly position to save men from death, nor wealth to fill men’s bellies. Moreover, he is ugly enough to startle all under heaven. He harmonizes but does not lead, and his knowledge does not extend beyond his domain. Yet men and women gather before him—he must possess something extraordinary.\"\n\nDuke Ai summoned him and observed him, and indeed his ugliness startled all under heaven. Before even a month had passed in his company, the Duke took interest in his character; before a full year had elapsed, the Duke trusted him. When the state had no minister, the Duke offered him the throne. He responded with hesitation, and when he spoke, his words were vague. The Duke felt ashamed, yet ultimately entrusted him with the state. Soon after, he left the Duke and departed. The Duke grieved as though bereft, as if the state held no joy without him. What manner of man was this?\n\nConfucius said, \"I once traveled to Chu and happened upon a piglet nursing from its dead mother. After a moment, it shrank back in alarm and fled. It saw no self in her, no likeness to itself. What it loved in its mother was not her form but that which animated her form. Warriors who die in battle are buried without ritual finery; a man who loses his feet is no longer cherished for his shoes—both have lost their root. When the Son of Heaven selects his consorts, they are not to pare their nails or pierce their ears; once married, they are not sent on further errands. Even those whose forms remain whole are thus esteemed—how much more one whose virtue is whole? Now, this Jifu Tuo has won trust without speaking, affection without merit, and been offered a state, only fearing he might refuse. He must be one whose talents are complete and whose virtue remains unmanifest.\"\n\nDuke Ai asked, \"What does it mean for talents to be complete?\"\n\nConfucius said, \"Life and death, survival and ruin, poverty and wealth, worthiness and unworthiness, slander and praise, hunger and thirst, cold and heat—these are the changes of affairs, the workings of fate. They alternate day and night before us, yet knowledge cannot fathom their beginnings. Thus, they should not disturb harmony or enter the mind’s sanctuary. One who makes others joyful and at ease, who remains open without losing balance, who ensures day and night flow without stagnation, bringing springtime to all things—this is one whose heart connects and gives rise to the seasons. This is what it means for talents to be complete.\n\n\"What does it mean for virtue to remain unmanifest? Stillness is the fullness of settled water. It may serve as a model, for it preserves within while remaining undisturbed without. Virtue is the cultivation of perfect harmony. One whose virtue remains unmanifest cannot be separated from things.\"\n\nAnother day, Duke Ai told Minzi what he had heard: \"At first, I thought ruling the world from the southern throne, holding the people’s guiding principles and fearing their deaths, was the height of understanding. Now, hearing the words of a perfected person, I fear I lack true substance, that I have lightly used my body and lost my state. Between Confucius and me, there is no lord and minister—only a bond of virtue.\"\n\nMinjiao, the hunchbacked and lipless, advised Duke Ling of Wei, who delighted in him; yet when he saw whole men, their necks seemed frail. The potbellied and emaciated advised Duke Huan of Qi, who delighted in him; yet when he saw whole men, their necks seemed frail. Thus, virtue may excel while form is forgotten. Do men forget what should be forgotten and remember what should not? This is called true forgetting.\n\nTherefore, the sage wanders freely, where knowledge becomes a snare, covenants become glue, virtue becomes a bond, and skill becomes trade. The sage does not scheme—why use knowledge? Does not sever—why use glue? Suffers no loss—why use virtue? Engages in no commerce—why trade? These four are the fasting of heaven. Heaven’s fasting is heaven’s nourishment. Having received nourishment from heaven, why rely on man?\n\nOne may have the form of a man but lack human emotions. Having the form of a man, one mingles with others; lacking human emotions, right and wrong do not cling to one. How small and insignificant—this is how one belongs to mankind. How vast and great—this is how one completes heaven alone.\n\nHuizi said to Zhuangzi, \"Do men truly have no emotions?\"\n\nZhuangzi said, \"Yes.\"\n\nHuizi said, \"If a man has no emotions, how can he be called a man?\"\n\nZhuangzi said, \"The Dao gives him appearance, heaven gives him form—how can he not be called a man?\"\n\nHuizi said, \"If he is called a man, how can he have no emotions?\"\n\nZhuangzi said, \"This is not what I mean by emotions. What I call having no emotions is that a man does not inwardly harm his body with likes and dislikes, but constantly follows nature without adding to life.\"\n\nHuizi said, \"Without adding to life, how can one preserve one’s body?\"\n\nZhuangzi said, \"The Dao gives him appearance, heaven gives him form—do not inwardly harm your body with likes and dislikes. Now you exhaust your spirit externally, weary your essence, lean against a tree and chant, rest on a withered catalpa and doze. Heaven chose your form, yet you clamor about ‘hard’ and ‘white.’\"\n\n*The Classic of Southern Florescence, Scroll One ends here.*\n\n*The Classic of Southern Florescence, Scroll Two: Inner Chapters*\n**Chapter Six: The Teacher of the Dao**\n\nTo know what heaven does and what man does—this is perfection. To know what heaven does is to be born of heaven; to know what man does is to use what one’s knowledge knows to nourish what one’s knowledge does not know, thus fulfilling one’s heavenly years without dying prematurely. This is the fullness of knowledge.\n\nYet there is a danger. Knowledge depends on something to be correct, but what it depends on is inherently uncertain. How can we know that what I call heaven is not man, or what I call man is not heaven? Only when there is a true person is there true knowledge.\n\nWhat is a true person? The true persons of old did not resist the few, did not boast of success, did not scheme for office. Thus, they erred without regret and succeeded without self-satisfaction. Thus, they climbed heights without trembling, entered water without getting wet, entered fire without feeling heat. Their knowledge could ascend to the Dao in this way.\n\nThe true persons of old slept without dreaming, woke without worry, ate without relishing, and breathed deeply. True persons breathed from their heels, while ordinary people breathe from their throats. Those who are forced to submit speak as though choking. Those whose desires run deep have shallow heavenly mechanisms.\n\nThe true persons of old knew neither delight in life nor aversion to death. Their departure brought no joy, their return no resistance; they simply went lightly away and came lightly back. They did not forget their beginning nor seek their end. They received life with delight and forgot it to return—this is what it means not to use the mind to cast aside the Dao, not to use man to aid heaven. This is called the true person.\n\nSuch a one’s mind is serene, their countenance still, their brow tranquil. Cold as autumn, warm as spring, their joy and anger flow with the four seasons, harmonizing with things yet no one knows their limit. Thus, when the sage employs arms, they may destroy a state yet lose no hearts. Their beneficence extends through ten thousand generations, yet they do not act out of love for others. Therefore, one who delights in harmonizing with things is no sage; one who has partiality is not benevolent; one who follows the seasons is not worthy; one who does not comprehend profit and harm is no gentleman; one who acts for fame and loses the self is no scholar; one who destroys the self yet is not true is no servant of others.\n\nThose like Hu Buxie, Wu Guang, Boyi, Shuqi, Jizi, Xuyu, Ji Ta, and Shentu Di—these are servants of others’ service, followers of others’ paths, unable to follow their own. The true persons of old bore righteousness yet did not form cliques, seemed insufficient yet did not seek fulfillment. They were yielding yet not weak, expansive yet not ostentatious. Their demeanor was joyful yet solemn, their actions seemed compelled. Their presence softened my countenance, their virtue stilled my power. They were stern as the world, yet untamable; connected as though fond of seclusion, yet their words were forgotten. They took punishment as their body, ritual as their wings, knowledge as their timing, and virtue as their guide.\n\nTaking punishment as their body, they were resolute in execution. Taking ritual as their wings, they moved through the world. Taking knowledge as their timing, they acted only when compelled. Taking virtue as their guide, they spoke as though reaching hills with those who have feet—yet others truly believed them to be diligent in conduct. Thus, their preferences were unified, and their aversions were unified. Their unity was one, and their disunity was one. Those who were one followed heaven; those who were not one followed man. Heaven and man do not overcome one another—this is called the true person.\n\nLife and death are fate, as constant as night and day—this is heaven. What man cannot partake in is the nature of things. They take heaven as their father and love it still—how much more that which transcends it? They take having a lord as better than themselves and die for it still—how much more that which is true?\n\nWhen springs dry, fish find themselves on land, wetting one another with their breath, moistening one another with their foam—better to forget one another in rivers and lakes. Rather than praising Yao and condemning Jie, it is better to forget both and be transformed by the Dao.\n\nThe great clod burdens me with form, labors me with life, eases me with old age, and rests me with death. Thus, to be good to my life is to be good to my death. Hiding a boat in a ravine or a mountain in a marsh seems secure, yet in the dead of night, a strong man may carry them away, and the unaware do not know. Hiding the small and large appropriately still leaves room for delay. But to hide the world within the world leaves no room for delay—this is the great truth of things.\n\nEven those who cherish their human form—if the human form is but one of ten thousand transformations yet to reach their limit, how immeasurable must their joy be? Thus, the sage wanders where things cannot delay and all endure. To be good at early death and old age, at beginnings and endings—people emulate this, let alone that on which the ten thousand things depend and the one transformation awaits.\n\nThe Dao has essence and trustworthiness, yet is without action or form. It can be transmitted but not received, attained but not seen. It is self-originating, self-rooted, existing before heaven and earth, enduring since ancient times. It spirits forth ghosts and gods, gives birth to heaven and earth. It is before the Supreme Ultimate yet not high, below the Six Directions yet not deep. It preceded heaven and earth yet is not ancient, older than antiquity yet not aged.\n\nXiwei obtained it and thereby lifted heaven and earth. Fuxi obtained it and thereby embraced the mother of qi. The Northern Dipper obtained it and has never faltered since. The sun and moon obtained it and have never ceased. Kanpi obtained it and thereby embraced Kunlun. Feng Yi obtained it and thereby roamed the great rivers. Jian Wu obtained it and thereby dwelt on Mount Tai. The Yellow Emperor obtained it and thereby ascended to the cloudy heavens. Zhuanxu obtained it and thereby dwelt in the Dark Palace. Yuqiang obtained it and stood at the North Pole. The Queen Mother of the West obtained it and sat in Shaoguang. None know its beginning, none know its end.\n\nPengzu obtained it, reaching from the time of Yu to the Five Hegemons. Fu Yue obtained it and served Wu Ding, ruling all under heaven, riding the tail of the Eastern Well and the handle of the Dipper, ranking among the stars.\n\nNanbo Zigui asked Nü Ou, “You are advanced in years, yet your complexion is like a child’s. How is this?” He replied, “I have heard the Dao.” Nanbo Zigui said, “Can the Dao be learned?” He said, “No. How could it? You are not the right person. Bu Liangyi has the talent of a sage but not the Dao of a sage. I have the Dao of a sage but not the talent of a sage. I wished to teach him, hoping he might truly become a sage. If not, teaching the Dao of a sage to one with the talent of a sage would be easy. I still guarded and taught him. After three days, he was able to put the world outside himself. Once he had put the world outside, I guarded him again. After seven days, he was able to put things outside himself. Once he had put things outside, I guarded him again. After nine days, he was able to put life outside himself.”\n\nOnce he had put life outside himself, only then was he able to attain clarity at dawn. Having attained clarity at dawn, only then was he able to perceive the One. Having perceived the One, only then was there no past and no present. Having transcended past and present, only then was he able to enter into that which is neither dead nor alive.\n\nThat which kills life does not die; that which gives life to life does not live. As a thing, it sends nothing away, welcomes nothing, destroys nothing, and completes nothing. Its name is Serene Repose. Serene Repose is that which attains completion through serenity.\n\nNanbo Zigui said, “From whom did you alone hear this?”\nHe replied, “I heard it from the disciple of Fu Mo, the disciple of Fu Mo heard it from the grandson of Luo Song, the grandson of Luo Song heard it from Zhan Ming, Zhan Ming heard it from Nie Xu, Nie Xu heard it from Xu Yi, Xu Yi heard it from Yu Shu, Yu Shu heard it from Xuan Ming, Xuan Ming heard it from Can Liao, and Can Liao heard it from Yi Shi.”\n\nZisi, Ziyu, Zili, and Zilai said to one another, “Who can take non-being as the head, life as the spine, and death as the tail, and who knows that life, death, existence, and extinction are one body? That one I would befriend.” The four looked at one another and smiled, their hearts in perfect accord, and so they became friends.\n\nSoon after, Ziyu fell ill, and Zisi went to inquire about him.\nHe said, “How magnificent!”\n\nThe Creator would make you thus confined and deformed?\nYour spine curves like a bow, your back humps, your five organs press upward, your navel sinks into your belly, your shoulders tower above your crown, and your chin points to the sky. The imbalance of yin and yang qi has thrown you into disorder, yet your heart remains at ease, untroubled. Leaning on your staff, you gaze into the well and sigh, “Ah! Would the Creator make me thus confined and deformed?”\n\nZisi said, “Do you resent this?”\nHe replied, “No, why should I resent it? If, little by little, my left arm were transformed into a rooster, I would use it to herald the dawn. If, little by little, my right arm were transformed into a crossbow, I would use it to hunt for roasted magpie. If, little by little, my body were transformed into a wheel, and my spirit into a horse, I would mount it—why ever change steeds? Moreover, what comes is timely; what goes is fitting. To rest in timeliness and abide in fittingness, neither joy nor sorrow can enter. This is what the ancients called ‘suspended release,’ yet those who cannot release themselves are bound by things. For long now, things have not overcome Heaven—why should I resent it?”\n\nSoon after, Zilai fell ill, gasping as if near death. His wife and children gathered around, weeping. Zili went to inquire after him and cried, “Shoo! Away! Do not disturb his transformation.” Leaning against the doorframe, he said to him, “How wondrous is the Creator! What will it make of you next? Where will it send you? Will it make you into a rat’s liver? A bug’s arm?”\n\nZilai replied, “Wherever a child goes—east, west, south, or north—he follows his parents’ command. Yin and yang are to man no less than parents. If they press me toward death and I resist, I would be obstinate—what fault would be theirs? The great earth burdens me with form, labors me with life, eases me with old age, and rests me with death. Thus, to make my life good is to make my death good. Now, if a great smith were casting metal, and the metal leapt up, crying, ‘I must become a Moye sword!’ the smith would surely deem it ill-omened metal. Now, if one were to assume human form and cry, ‘A human! A human!’ the Creator would surely deem him an ill-omened man. If we take heaven and earth as a great furnace and the Creator as a great smith, where could we go and not be well?”\n\nThen he fell asleep as if in completion and awoke as if in bloom.\n\nZisang Hu, Mengzi Fan, and Zi Qin Zhang became friends, saying to one another, “Who can join in joining, act in non-acting? Who can ascend the heavens, roam the mists, rove without limit, forget life, and never reach an end?” The two looked at one another and smiled, their hearts in perfect accord, and so they became friends.\n\nBy and by, Zisang Hu died. Before he was buried, Confucius, hearing of it, sent Zigong to assist with the rites. One wove a song, another strummed the zither, and together they sang in harmony:\n“Ah, Zisang Hu!\nAh, Zisang Hu!\nYou have returned to your true nature,\nWhile I remain a mere man.”\n\nZigong hurried forward and said, “May I ask whether singing before the corpse accords with ritual?”\nThe two looked at each other and smiled, saying, “What does he know of the meaning of ritual?”\n\nZigong returned and reported to Confucius, saying, “What sort of men are they? They cultivate no conduct, treat their bodies as external, and sing before the corpse without changing countenance—there is no name for them. What sort of men are they?”\n\nConfucius said, “They roam beyond the realm; I roam within it. Beyond and within do not meet, yet I sent you to offer condolences—how boorish I was! They are now companions to the Creator, roaming as one with the qi of heaven and earth.”\n\nThey regard life as an excrescent wart, death as the bursting of a boil—how could such men know where life and death, before and after, truly lie? Borrowing from other things, they lodge in the same body; they forget liver and gall, disregard ears and eyes. Reversing and repeating, beginning and ending, they know not head nor tail. Vagrant beyond the dust and grime, they wander carefree in the work of non-action. How could they trouble themselves with the fuss of worldly ritual, seeking to impress the eyes and ears of the crowd?\n\nZigong said, “Then what Way do you, Master, rely upon?”\nConfucius said, “I am one whom Heaven has punished. Yet even so, I share it with you.”\nZigong said, “May I ask what that Way is?”\nConfucius said, “Fish are made for water, as men are made for the Dao. Those made for water thrive when they carve out ponds; those made for the Dao find life settled without need for action. Thus it is said: fish forget one another in rivers and lakes, men forget one another in the arts of the Dao.”\n\nZigong said, “May I ask about the *qi*-man?”\nConfucius said, “The *qi*-man is *qi* to men but a companion to Heaven. Thus it is said: the petty man of Heaven is the gentleman of men; the gentleman of men is the petty man of Heaven.”\n\nYan Hui asked Confucius, saying, “When Mengsun Cai’s mother died, he wept without tears, felt no grief in his heart, and showed no sorrow in mourning. Lacking these three, he was yet praised throughout Lu for his mastery of mourning. Is it truly possible to gain a name without the reality? I find it most strange.”\nConfucius said, “Mengsun has exhausted the matter—he has advanced beyond knowledge. Though he sought to simplify, he could not; yet he has already simplified. Mengsun does not know why he lives, nor why he dies; he does not know what to pursue first, nor what to pursue later. Transformed into a thing, he awaits whatever transformations he does not yet know. And even as he is about to transform, how could he know that he will not transform? Even as he is about to remain unchanged, how could he know that he has not already transformed? You and I are but dreamers who have not yet awakened. Moreover, he may be startled by a change in form, but his heart remains unharmed; he may dwell in a new abode, but his essence does not die. Mengsun alone is awake—others weep, so he weeps too; that is simply his nature. Besides, we all call this ‘I’ of ours ‘I,’ but how do we know what we mean by ‘our I’? You may dream you are a bird soaring in the sky, or a fish diving into the deep. But do you know whether the one speaking now is awake or dreaming? When joy comes, you cannot laugh in time; when laughter comes, you cannot arrange it. Accept the arrangement and follow transformation—then you enter the vast oneness of Heaven.”\n\nYi’erzi went to see Xu You.\nXu You said, “What did Yao give you?”\nYi’erzi said, “Yao told me, ‘You must personally practice benevolence and righteousness and clearly distinguish right and wrong.’”\nXu You said, “Then why have you come? Yao has already branded you with benevolence and righteousness and mutilated you with right and wrong—how will you wander the paths of carefree, uninhibited, and ever-shifting freedom?”\nYi’erzi said, “Even so, I wish to roam within their bounds.”\nXu You said, “Not so. The blind cannot appreciate the beauty of brows and eyes; the colorblind cannot distinguish blue and yellow. Yi’erzi said, “Yet Wu Zhuang lost her beauty, Ju Liang lost his strength, and the Yellow Emperor lost his knowledge—all in the space of the forge and hammer. How do we know the Creator will not remove my brands and mend my mutilations, allowing me to ride perfection and follow you, Master?”\nXu You said, “Ah, who can say? Let me tell you the general idea. My teacher! My teacher! He slays the myriad things yet is not cruel; his blessings reach ten thousand generations yet he is not benevolent. Older than high antiquity, he is not aged; he covers and bears heaven and earth, carves and shapes all forms, yet is not skillful. This is the realm in which he wanders.”\n\nYan Hui said, “I have made progress.”\nConfucius said, “What do you mean?”\nYan Hui said, “I have forgotten benevolence and righteousness.”\nConfucius said, “Good, but not yet enough.”\nAnother day, he saw Confucius again and said, “I have made progress.”\nConfucius said, “What do you mean?”\nYan Hui said, “I have forgotten ritual and music.”\nConfucius said, “Good, but not yet enough.”\nAnother day, he saw Confucius again and said, “I have made progress.”\nConfucius said, “What do you mean?”\nYan Hui said, “I sit and forget.”\nConfucius started and said, “What do you mean by ‘sit and forget’?”\nYan Hui said, “I cast off my limbs and trunk, dim my faculties and intelligence, leave my form and abandon knowledge, and merge with the Great Pervasion. This is what I mean by ‘sit and forget.’”\nConfucius said, “To merge is to have no preferences; to transform is to have no constancy. You are indeed worthy! I beg to follow after you.”\n\nYan Yu and Zi Sang were friends. After ten days of soaking rain, Yan Yu said, “Zi Sang must be ill.” He wrapped some rice and went to feed him. Arriving at Zi Sang’s gate, he heard something between singing and weeping, as Zi Sang plucked his zither and cried:\n\n“Father? Mother?\nHeaven? Man?\nAh—”\n\nHis voice could not bear the strain, and he hurriedly struck the strings in time. Yan Yu entered and asked, “Why do you sing like this?”\n\nZi Sang replied, “I pondered who brought me to this extremity, but I could not find the answer. Would my parents wish me to be poor? Heaven covers all without partiality; Earth bears all without partiality. Would Heaven and Earth single me out for poverty? I sought the one who caused this, but I could not find him. Yet here I am at this extremity—it must be fate!”\n\n---\n\n*The Nanhua True Classic, Scroll Two: Inner Chapters, “Fit for Emperors,” Chapter Seven*\n\nNie Que questioned Wang Ni four times, and four times Wang Ni professed ignorance. Nie Que leapt up in great joy and went to tell Pu Yi Zi.\n\nPu Yi Zi said, “Now you have truly come to know it? The Lords of Yu do not compare to the Lord of Tai. The Lords of Yu, though they hoarded virtue to win men’s hearts, did gain men’s hearts, yet they never escaped the realm of the unnatural. The Lord of Tai, in his outward demeanor, was unhurried; in his awakening, he was all-pervasive. At times he took himself for a horse, at times for an ox. His understanding transcended form and abandoned knowledge, merging with the Great Pervasion—this is what is called ‘sitting in forgetfulness.’”\n\nConfucius said, “To merge is to have no preferences; to transform is to have no constancy. You are indeed worthy! I beg to follow after you.”\n\n---\n\nYan Yu and Zi Sang were friends. After ten days of soaking rain, Yan Yu said, “Zi Sang must be ill.” He wrapped some rice and went to feed him. Arriving at Zi Sang’s gate, he heard something between singing and weeping, as Zi Sang plucked his zither and cried:\n\n“Father? Mother?\nHeaven? Man?”\n\n“Man, then? Yet his voice could not bear the strain, and so he hastened to recite his verse.”\n\nYan Yu entered and asked, “Why do you sing your poem in this manner?”\n\nZi Sang replied, “I ponder who has brought me to this extremity, yet I cannot find the answer. Would my parents wish me to be poor? Heaven covers all without partiality; earth bears all without favor. Would heaven and earth single me out for poverty? I seek the one who has done this, yet I cannot find him. Nevertheless, to reach this extremity—this is fate, is it not?”\n\nNie Que questioned Wang Ni four times, and four times Wang Ni professed ignorance. Thereupon Nie Que leapt up in great joy and went to tell Master Pu Yi.\n\nMaster Pu Yi said, “Have you only now come to know this? The Lord of Yu fell short, yet in his awakening he was all-pervasive, at times taking himself for a horse, at times for an ox. His knowledge was true to his nature, his virtue most genuine, and he had never entered the realm of man.”\n\nJian Wu met Jie Yu the Madman. Jie Yu asked, “What did Ri Zhongshi tell you at noon?”\n\nJian Wu replied, “He told me that a ruler of men must issue decrees, standards, principles, and measures from himself—who would dare not obey and be transformed?”\n\nJie Yu said, “This is deceptive virtue. In governing the world, it is like crossing the sea by digging a river or making a flea carry a mountain. Does the sage’s governance concern externals? He rectifies himself and then acts, merely ensuring that those capable of the task can fulfill it. Moreover, the bird flies high to avoid the harm of nets and arrows, while the mole digs deep beneath the sacred mound to escape the calamity of pitfalls—yet you would call these two creatures ignorant?”\n\nTian Gen was wandering at Yin Yang when he came to the banks of the Liao River. There he encountered an unnamed man and asked him, “May I inquire about governing the world?”\n\nThe unnamed man said, “Begone! You are a vulgar man—why do you ask such an inopportune question? I am about to become one with the Creator. When weary, I shall ride the nebulous bird beyond the six directions and wander in the land of Nothing Whatever, dwelling in the boundless wilds. Why do you disturb my heart with talk of governing the world?”\n\nTian Gen asked again.\n\nThe unnamed man replied, “Let your mind wander in simplicity, blend your qi with the vastness, follow things as they are without imposing your private will—and the world will be governed.”\n\nYang Ziju met Lao Dan and said, “Here is a man swift, strong, and resolute, with keen perception and clear understanding, who studies the Dao tirelessly. Could such a one be compared to an enlightened king?”\n\nLao Dan replied, “In the eyes of the sage, such a man is like a clerk or artisan, bound by skill and toil, exhausting his body and straining his mind. Moreover, the patterns of tigers and leopards attract hunters, while the agility of monkeys and the cunning of dogs trained to catch rats bring them to the leash. Could such a one be compared to an enlightened king?”\n\nYang Ziju, startled, asked, “May I inquire about the governance of an enlightened king?”\n\nLao Dan said, “The achievements of an enlightened king cover the world yet seem not his own; he transforms and bestows upon the ten thousand things, yet the people do not rely on him. No name is raised, and he allows things to rejoice in themselves. He stands in the unfathomable and wanders in the realm of Nothing.”\n\nIn Zheng there was a divine diviner named Ji Xian, who knew of men’s deaths and lives, survivals and perishings, fortunes and misfortunes, long lives and early deaths, predicting them by the year, month, ten-day week, or day, as if by spirit. When the people of Zheng saw him, they all fled in haste. Liezi saw him and was enchanted in heart. Returning, he told Master Hu, saying, “At first I took your Dao as the ultimate, but now there is something even more ultimate.”\n\nMaster Hu said, “I have shown you only its form, not yet its reality—do you truly possess the Dao? Though many hens may gather, without a rooster how can they lay fertile eggs? You take your seclusion and contend with the world, so you must be genuine, which is why others can read your fortune. Try bringing him here to show him me.”\n\nThe next day, Liezi brought Ji Xian to see Master Hu. When they came out, Ji Xian said to Liezi, “Alas! Your master is dead—he will not live. Not even ten days remain. I saw something strange in him, like damp ashes.”\n\nLiezi entered and wept, his tears soaking his lapels, as he told Master Hu. Master Hu said, “I showed him the pattern of earth—still and unshaken, neither moving nor upright. He likely saw my blocked virtue-mechanism. Try bringing him again.”\n\nThe next day, Liezi brought Ji Xian to see Master Hu again. When they came out, Ji Xian said to Liezi, “Fortunate that your master met me! He is restored—fully alive. I saw his blocked potential.”\n\nLiezi entered and told Master Hu. Master Hu said, “I showed him the expanse of heaven and earth—names and realities did not enter, yet the mechanism arose from his heels. He likely saw my mechanism of goodness. Try bringing him again.”\n\nThe next day, Liezi brought Ji Xian to see Master Hu again. When they came out, Ji Xian said to Liezi, “Your master is unsettled—I cannot read his fortune. If he settles, I will try again.”\n\nLiezi entered and told Master Hu. Master Hu said, “I humbly showed him the Great Thoroughfare where nothing prevails. He likely saw my balanced qi-mechanism. The stillness of a deep ravine forms a profound abyss; the stillness of water forms a profound abyss; the flow of water forms a profound abyss. There are nine names for abyss—here he saw three. Try bringing him again.”\n\nThe next day, Liezi brought Ji Xian to see Master Hu again. Before he could stand steadily, Ji Xian lost himself and fled. Master Hu said, “Pursue him.”\n\nLiezi chased him but could not catch up. Returning, he reported to Master Hu, “He has vanished—he is gone. I could not reach him.”\n\nMaster Hu said, “I showed him what had never yet departed from my origin. I met him with emptiness and compliance, not knowing who or what he was. He took me for a drifting gourd, for a flowing wave—hence his flight.”\n\nAfter this, Liezi considered himself as one who had never yet begun to learn. He returned home and for three years did not go out. He cooked for his wife, fed pigs as if feeding people, and in affairs kept no special closeness. He carved away excess and returned to simplicity, standing alone in his form like an unworked clod. Entangled yet sealed, he ended thus. He became no vessel for fame, no repository for schemes, no bearer of tasks, no master of knowledge. His body embraced the boundless, and he wandered without trace. He exhausted what he received from heaven yet saw no gain—he was merely empty. The mind of the perfected man is like a mirror: it does not send forth, does not welcome, responds yet does not store, and thus can master things without harm.\n\nThe emperor of the Southern Sea was Shu, the emperor of the Northern Sea was Hu, and the emperor of the Central Sea was Hundun. Shu and Hu often met in Hundun’s land, and Hundun treated them very well. Shu and Hu plotted to repay Hundun’s kindness, saying, “All people have seven openings for seeing, hearing, eating, and breathing—only he has none. Let us try to bore them for him.” Each day they bored one opening, and on the seventh day, Hundun died.\n\n*Chapter Eight of the Outer Chapters of the True Scripture of Southern Florescence: \"Webbed Toes\"*\n\nWebbed toes and extra fingers arise from nature yet exceed in virtue; hanging tumors and dangling warts arise from form yet exceed in nature. Those who multiply methods of benevolence and righteousness and apply them are arrayed among the five organs, yet this is not the true standard of the Dao. Thus, webbing in the feet is but connected useless flesh; branching in the hands is but an extra useless finger. Those who multiply methods and branch out in the passions of the five organs indulge in perverse practices of benevolence and righteousness and multiply the uses of intelligence. Thus, those with webbing in their vision confuse the five colors, indulge in ornate patterns, and dazzle with blues, yellows, and fish-scale brilliance—is this not Li Zhu? Those with branching in their hearing confuse the five sounds, indulge in the six pitches, and resound with metal, stone, silk, bamboo, the Yellow Bell, and the Great Regulator—is this not Shi Kuang? Those who branch in benevolence pluck at virtue and block their nature to gather fame, making the world drum up support for unattainable laws—are these not Zeng and Shi? Those with webbing in their eloquence weave tangled knots of words, roaming their minds among the questions of hardness and whiteness, sameness and difference, and exhaust jade-like reputations with useless speech—are these not Yang and Mo? Thus, all these are paths of excess webbing and branching, not the ultimate standard of the world. That which is truly upright does not lose the truth of its nature and life. Therefore, what is joined is not called webbing, and what branches is not called divergence; what is long is not called excess, and what is short is not called deficiency. Thus, the duck’s legs are short, but lengthening them would cause sorrow; the crane’s legs are long, but cutting them would cause grief. Therefore, what is long by nature should not be cut, and what is short by nature should not be lengthened—there is no need to remove sorrow. Do benevolence and righteousness truly not accord with human nature? Why do those benevolent people have so many worries? Moreover, those with webbed toes feel pain when separated, and those with extra fingers cry when pinched. These two—whether in excess or deficiency in number—share the same sorrow. The benevolent people of today gaze with concern at the world’s calamities; the unbenevolent people harm their nature and life to glut themselves on wealth and honor.\n\nThus, do benevolence and righteousness truly not accord with human nature? Since the Three Dynasties and below, why has the world been so clamorous? Moreover, those who rely on hooks, cords, compasses, and squares to make things straight cut away at their nature; those who depend on ropes, glue, and lacquer to make things firm encroach upon their virtue. Bending and folding with rites and music, mouthing benevolence and righteousness to soothe the hearts of the world—this is to lose what is constant and natural. The world has its constant and natural state. In this state, the crooked need no hook, the straight need no cord, the round need no compass, the square need no square, adhesion requires no glue or lacquer, and binding needs no rope. Thus, the world is born in harmony, all living yet not knowing why they live, all attaining yet not knowing why they attain. From ancient times to the present, this has never changed—it cannot be diminished. Then why do benevolence and righteousness cling like glue and lacquer, entangle like ropes, and wander between the Dao and virtue? They only confuse the world.\n\nMinor delusions distort direction; great delusions distort nature. How do we know this is so? Since the time of Yu’s dynasty, when benevolence and righteousness were promoted to disturb the world, all under heaven have rushed to answer the call of benevolence and righteousness—is this not using benevolence and righteousness to alter their nature? Let us examine this: since the Three Dynasties and below, has there been anyone in the world who has not exchanged their nature for external things?\n\nThe petty man sacrifices himself for profit; the scholar sacrifices himself for fame; the grandee sacrifices himself for his family; the sage sacrifices himself for the world. Though these several types differ in their undertakings and their reputations bear different names, in harming their nature and sacrificing themselves, they are one.\n\nZang and Gu were two men who herded sheep together, yet both lost their sheep. When asked what Zang was doing, he was holding books and reading; when asked what Gu was doing, he was gambling for sport. Though their occupations differed, in losing their sheep they were the same.\n\nBoyi died for fame beneath Shouyang Mountain, while Robber Zhi died for profit atop Dongling. Though their deaths differed, in harming their lives and injuring their natures they were the same. Why must Boyi be right and Robber Zhi wrong? The world is entirely given to sacrifice: those who sacrifice for benevolence and righteousness are called gentlemen by custom; those who sacrifice for wealth and property are called petty men. In their sacrifice, they are one—some are gentlemen, some are petty men. But if we consider the harm to their lives and the injury to their natures, then Robber Zhi is no different from Boyi. How then can we distinguish between gentleman and petty man?\n\nMoreover, those who bind their nature to benevolence and righteousness, though as learned as Zeng and Shi, are not what I call good; those who bind their nature to the five flavors, though as skilled as Yu’er, are not what I call good; those who bind their nature to the five sounds, though as perceptive as Master Kuang, are not what I call keen; those who bind their nature to the five colors, though as discerning as Li Zhu, are not what I call clear-sighted.\n\nWhat I call good is not the so-called benevolence and righteousness, but preserving one’s virtue alone. What I call good is not the so-called benevolence and righteousness, but preserving one’s virtue alone. What I call good is not the so-called benevolence and righteousness, but following the true nature of one’s life. What I call keen is not hearing others, but hearing oneself; what I call clear-sighted is not seeing others, but seeing oneself.\n\nThose who do not see themselves but see others, who do not attain for themselves but attain for others—these attain what others attain yet do not attain what they themselves attain, they follow what others follow yet do not follow what they themselves follow. Whether Robber Zhi or Boyi, those who follow what others follow and do not follow what they themselves follow are equally excessive and perverse.\n\nI am ashamed before the Dao and virtue, and so above I dare not practice the conduct of benevolence and righteousness, and below I dare not engage in excessive and perverse actions.\n\n*Southern Florescence Perfected Scripture, Scroll Two, Outer Chapters: \"Horse’s Hooves\" (Chapter Nine)*\n\nA horse’s hooves can tread upon frost and snow; its hair can resist wind and cold. It grazes on grass and drinks water, lifts its feet and gallops—this is the true nature of the horse. Though there be grand halls and towering chambers, they are of no use to it. But when Bo Le arrived and said, “I am skilled in managing horses...”\n\nTo burn and brand them, to pare and carve them, to bind them with bridles and reins, to confine them with early-morning stalls—of horses thus treated, twelve or thirteen in every twenty die. To starve them, to parch them, to drive them at a gallop, to spur them to a run, to marshal them in ranks, to align them in formation, with the peril of elaborate trappings before them and the threat of whips and lashes behind—of horses thus treated, more than half die.\n\nThe potter says, “I am skilled in shaping clay: round vessels meet the compass, square ones meet the carpenter’s square.” The craftsman says, “I am skilled in shaping wood: curved pieces meet the hook, straight ones meet the plumb line.” But do clay and wood by nature desire to meet compass, square, hook, and plumb line? Yet generation after generation praises them, saying, “Bo Le is skilled in managing horses, and potters and carpenters are skilled in shaping clay and wood.” This is also the error of those who govern the world.\n\nIn my view, those who are truly skilled in governing the world do not act thus. The people have a constant nature: they weave to clothe themselves, they plow to feed themselves—this is called shared virtue. Unified yet not partisan, this is called “Heaven’s release.” Thus in the age of utmost virtue, their movements were unhurried, their gazes were steady. At that time, mountains had no paths or tunnels, marshes had no boats or bridges. The myriad things thrived in flocks, linked to their native lands. Birds and beasts gathered in herds, grasses and trees grew to fullness. Thus one could lead birds and beasts by the halter and wander with them, or climb to the nests of crows and magpies and peer inside. In the age of utmost virtue, people dwelled together with birds and beasts, lived in kinship with the myriad things. How would they know of gentlemen and petty men? Alike in their lack of knowledge, their virtue did not depart; alike in their lack of desire, they were called “plain and unhewn.” In plainness and unhewn simplicity, the people’s nature was preserved.\n\nBut when the sages came, they trod and trampled to create benevolence, they lifted and prodded to create righteousness—and the world began to doubt. They spread and scattered to create music, they picked and selected to create ritual—and the world began to divide. Thus if the unhewn block is not carved, who would make sacrificial goblets? If white jade is not cut, who would make ritual scepters? If the Dao and virtue are not abandoned, why would one need benevolence and righteousness? If nature and feeling are not estranged, why would one need ritual and music? If the five colors are not confused, who would create patterned embroidery? If the five notes are not disordered, who would tune them to the six pitch-pipes? To carve the unhewn into vessels is the fault of the craftsman; to destroy the Dao and virtue to create benevolence and righteousness is the error of the sage.\n\nThe horse, dwelling on land, eats grass and drinks water; when pleased, it nuzzles necks with its companions; when angry, it turns its back and kicks. This is all the horse knows. But when one adds a crossbar and yoke, aligns it with blinkers, the horse learns to feign submission, to balk at the bit, to startle and bolt, to cheat the bridle, to steal the reins. Thus the horse’s knowledge, able to reach the point of theft, is the fault of Bo Le.\n\nIn the time of the Lord of Brightness, the people dwelled without knowing what to do, wandered without knowing where to go. They carried food in their cheeks and played, patted their bellies and roamed—this was all the people could do. But when the sages came, they bent and twisted ritual and music to correct the world’s form, they hung up benevolence and righteousness to console the world’s heart—and the people then began to tread the byways of cunning and love of knowledge, to contend in pursuit of profit, unable to stop. This, too, is the error of the sages.\n\n*Southern Florescence Perfected Scripture, Scroll Two, Outer Chapters: \"The Collar-Basket\" (Chapter Ten)*\n\nIf one prepares locks, cords, and sturdy bolts to guard against thieves who would pry open baskets, rummage through bags, or break into chests, this is what the world calls wisdom. Yet when the great thief comes, he shoulders the chest, lifts the basket, carries the bag, and flees—fearing only that the cords, locks, and bolts are not secure enough. Thus what was formerly called wisdom is nothing but amassing goods for the great thief.\n\nLet me try to discuss this: Is there anything in what the world calls wisdom that does not amass for the great thief? Is there anything in what it calls sagacity that does not guard for the great thief? How do I know this is so? In ancient times, the state of Qi had villages so close they could see one another, and the sounds of their chickens and dogs could be heard across the land. The area where nets and traps were spread, where plows and hoes were used, extended over three thousand *li* square. Within its four borders, in all its ancestral temples, altars of soil and grain, cities, towns, districts, and villages—was there any place where they did not model themselves on the sages? Yet one morning, Tian Chengzi killed the ruler of Qi and stole his state. What he stole was not merely the state—he also stole the sagely laws along with it. Thus though Tian Chengzi bore the name of a thief and bandit, he lived in the security of Yao and Shun. Small states dared not criticize him, great states dared not punish him, and for twelve generations he held the state of Qi. Was this not stealing the state of Qi along with its sagely laws to guard his thieving body?\n\nLet me try to discuss this: Is there anything in what the world calls supreme wisdom that does not amass for the great thief? Is there anything in what it calls supreme sagacity that does not guard for the great thief? How do I know this is so? In ancient times, Guan Longpeng was beheaded, Bi Gan was disemboweled, Chang Hong was torn apart, and Wu Zixu was torn to shreds. Thus though these four were worthy men, they could not escape execution.\n\nA disciple asked Robber Zhi, “Do thieves also have a Dao?” Robber Zhi said, “Where can one go without a Dao? To guess the treasures hidden in a room is sagacity; to enter first is courage; to leave last is righteousness; to know whether it can be done is knowledge; to divide the spoils equally is benevolence. Without these five, no one in the world has ever become a great thief.”\n\nFrom this we see that the good man cannot stand without the Dao of the sage, and Robber Zhi cannot act without the Dao of the sage. Since there are few good men in the world and many who are not good, the sage brings little benefit to the world and much harm. Thus it is said: When the lips are gone, the teeth grow cold; when the wine of Lu was weak, the city of Handan was besieged; when sages arise, great thieves appear. Strike down the sages, release the thieves and bandits—and the world will begin to be ordered.\n\nWhen rivers run dry, valleys empty; when hills are leveled, deep pools fill. When the sages die, great thieves will not arise, and the world will be at peace, without trouble.\n\nIf the sage does not die, great thieves will not cease. Though one may exalt the sage to govern the world, this is but to heap profit upon Robber Zhi. When measures and pecks are made to gauge, he steals both measure and peck; when scales and balances are made to weigh, he steals both scale and balance; when tallies and seals are made to authenticate, he steals both tally and seal; when benevolence and righteousness are made to rectify, he steals both benevolence and righteousness. How do we know this is so? He who steals a hook is executed, but he who steals a state becomes a feudal lord—benevolence and righteousness abide at the gates of such lords. Is this not the theft of benevolence, righteousness, sagacity, and wisdom? Thus, those who pursue great thieves, usurp the ranks of feudal lords, and seize the profits of benevolence, righteousness, measures, scales, tallies, and seals—even with the rewards of high office, none can be encouraged; even with the threat of the executioner’s axe, none can be restrained. This heaping of profit for Robber Zhi, making him unstoppable, is the fault of the sage.\n\nThus it is said: The fish must not leave the deep; the state’s sharpest tools must not be shown to others. The sage is the world’s sharpest tool—he is not what should be displayed to the world. Therefore, cut off sagacity and cast aside wisdom, and great thieves will cease; smash jade and shatter pearls, and petty thieves will not arise; burn tallies and break seals, and the people will return to simplicity; discard measures and snap balances, and the people will know no contention. Only after destroying the world’s sagely laws can the people be fit for discussion. Throw the six pitch-pipes into chaos, melt down flutes and zithers, deafen the ears of Master Kuang, and the world will begin to set aside its hearing; erase patterns, scatter the five colors, blind the eyes of Li Zhu, and the world will begin to set aside its sight; break hooks and cords, discard compass and square, cripple the fingers of the artisan Chui, and the world will begin to possess its skill. Thus it is said: Great skill appears clumsy.\n\nErase the conduct of Zeng and Shi, silence the mouths of Yang and Mo, cast aside benevolence and righteousness, and the world’s virtue will begin to attain profound unity. When people contain their brightness, the world will not be dazzled; when people set aside their hearing, the world will not be burdened; when people contain their knowledge, the world will not be deluded; when people contain their virtue, the world will not be perverse. Those like Zeng, Shi, Yang, Mo, Master Kuang, the artisan Chui, and Li Zhu—all externally establish their virtue and thereby confuse the world—are of no use to the law.\n\nDo you alone not know of the age of perfect virtue? In ancient times, under the reigns of Rongcheng, Dating, Bohuang, Zhongyang, Lilu, Lixu, Xuanyuan, Hexu, Zunlu, Zhurong, Fuxi, and Shennong, the people knotted cords to keep records. They savored their food, admired their clothing, delighted in their customs, and rested content in their dwellings. Neighboring states were within sight of one another, the sounds of chickens and dogs carried between them, yet the people grew old and died without ever traveling beyond their lands. In such an age, perfect governance was already achieved.\n\nBut now, it has come to this: the people crane their necks and stand on tiptoe, saying, “In such-and-such a place there is a worthy one,” and they carry provisions to flock there—abandoning their parents at home and forsaking their lords’ service abroad.\n\nTheir footprints tread upon the borders of the lords’ domains, and the ruts of their chariots entangle a thousand *li* beyond—all because those above are excessively fond of knowledge. If those above truly cherish knowledge while lacking the Dao, the world will fall into great chaos.\n\nHow do we know this is so? When the cunning of bows, crossbows, snares, and traps multiplies, birds are thrown into turmoil above. When the schemes of hooks, baits, nets, and weirs proliferate, fish are thrown into turmoil in the waters. When the devices of fences, nets, and pitfall traps grow numerous, beasts are thrown into turmoil in the marshes. When the deceptions of crafty deceit, poisonous sophistry, and the disputes over \"hard and white\" or \"same and different\" abound, the common folk are bewildered by rhetoric.\n\nThus, the world repeatedly falls into great chaos, and the fault lies in the love of knowledge. For the world all knows to seek what it does not know, yet none knows to seek what it already knows; all knows to condemn what it deems unworthy, yet none knows to condemn what it already deems worthy. This is why great chaos arises.\n\nAbove, it eclipses the brightness of the sun and moon; below, it scorches the essence of mountains and rivers; in between, it disrupts the unfolding of the four seasons. Even the creatures that crawl and flutter—none retain their true nature. How severe is the disorder wrought by the love of knowledge upon the world! This has been the case since the Three Dynasties and beyond: abandoning the simple and unadorned people, they delight in the toiling flattery of the obsequious. Forsaking tranquil non-action, they take pleasure in the restless clamor of cleverness—this restless clamor has thrown the world into chaos.\n\n*The Southern Florescence Scripture*, Scroll Two, Outer Chapters: \"Maintaining and Accommodating\" (Chapter Eleven)\n\nWe hear of maintaining and accommodating the world, but never of governing the world. What does \"maintaining\" mean? It is to fear that the world will corrupt its nature. What does \"accommodating\" mean? It is to fear that the world will alter its virtue. If the world neither corrupts its nature nor alters its virtue, is there any need to govern it?\n\nIn ancient times, when Yao governed the world, he made the people joyful and content in their nature—this was not tranquility. When Jie governed the world, he made the people weary and distressed in their nature—this was not happiness. Neither the absence of tranquility nor the absence of happiness is virtue. And that which is not virtue cannot endure for long.\n\nWhen people are excessively joyful, they harm the yang; when excessively angry, they harm the yin. When yin and yang are both harmed, the four seasons fail to arrive, the harmony of cold and heat is lost, and in turn, this injures the human form. It causes people’s joy and anger to lose their proper place, their dwellings to lack constancy, their thoughts to find no fulfillment, and their endeavors to remain incomplete. From this, the world first becomes restless and unruly, and only then do the conducts of thieves like Zhi and sages like Zeng and Shi arise.\n\nThus, if one were to reward all the good in the world, it would not suffice; if one were to punish all the evil, it would not be enough. Therefore, the vastness of the world is insufficient for rewards and punishments. Since the Three Dynasties and beyond, they have clamored endlessly over rewards and punishments—when would they have had leisure to preserve the true essence of their natures and lives?\n\nMoreover, to delight in cleverness is to be seduced by appearances; to delight in sharpness is to be seduced by sounds; to delight in benevolence is to disorder virtue; to delight in righteousness is to pervert principle; to delight in ritual is to indulge in artifice; to delight in music is to indulge in excess; to delight in sagacity is to indulge in skill; to delight in knowledge is to indulge in fault-finding. If the world seeks to preserve the true essence of its nature and life, these eight may exist or vanish—it matters not. But if the world does not preserve the true essence of its nature and life, these eight become twisted, entangled, and knotted, throwing the world into chaos. And yet, the world begins to revere and cherish them—how profound is its delusion!\n\nIs it merely a matter of recognizing their excess and discarding them? No, they fast and purify themselves to speak of them, kneel and sit to present them, drum and sing to dance for them—what is to be done about this?\n\nThus, when the noble person is compelled to oversee the world, nothing is better than non-action. Only through non-action can the true essence of nature and life be preserved. Therefore, one who values their own person over governing the world may be entrusted with the world; one who cherishes their own person over governing the world may be charged with the world.\n\nIf the noble person can refrain from disturbing their five viscera and from flaunting their intelligence; if they dwell like an ancestral tablet yet manifest like a dragon, remain as still as an abyss yet resound like thunder, move with the spirit and the heavens follow, and act with ease and non-action so that the myriad things rise like steam—then what leisure would they have to govern the world?\n\nCui Qu asked Lao Cong, \"If one does not govern the world, how can the hearts of the people be settled?\"\nLao Cong replied, \"Be careful not to agitate the human heart. The human heart presses downward yet strives upward, trapped between above and below, now yielding, now unyielding, now soft, now hard. It is sharp and carving, its heat scorching like fire, its cold congealing like ice. Its swiftness spans the four seas in the blink of an eye; when at rest, it is deep and still; when in motion, it soars to the heavens. Fierce and proud, it cannot be bound—is there anything like the human heart?\n\nIn ancient times, the Yellow Emperor first used benevolence and righteousness to agitate the human heart. Yao and Shun then wore their thighs bare and their shins hairless in toiling to nourish the forms of the world. They exhausted their five viscera to establish benevolence and righteousness, strained their blood and qi to model laws and standards. Yet even so, they could not prevail. Thus, Yao banished Huan Dou to Mount Chong, exiled the Three Miao to Sanwei, and sent Gong Gong to Youdu—this was their failure to overcome the world.\n\nBy the time this reached the Three Kings, the world was thrown into great alarm. Below, there were tyrants like Jie and Robber Zhi; above, there were sages like Zeng and Shi; and the Confucians and Mohists all arose. From this, joy and anger suspected one another, the foolish and the wise deceived one another, the good and the bad condemned one another, the truthful and the deceitful mocked one another—and the world declined. Virtue diverged, and the nature and lives of the people scattered like wildflowers.\n\nThe world loved knowledge, and the common people were driven to exhaustion. Thus, saws and axes were fashioned, inked cords and knives were wielded, chisels and mallets were employed. The world was thrown into great disorder—all because of the agitation of the human heart.\"\n\nThus, the worthy withdrew to dwell beneath the great mountains and towering cliffs, while the lords of ten thousand chariots trembled with anxiety in their ancestral halls. In this age, those condemned to death lie heaped upon one another; those in stocks press shoulder to shoulder; and the executed stretch as far as the eye can see. Yet the Confucians and Mohists still raise their arms in contention amidst the fetters and cangues—how extreme is their shamelessness! How utterly devoid of remorse! I know not whether the wisdom of sages does not in truth become the stocks and pillories that break men’s limbs, or whether benevolence and righteousness do not become the fetters and cangues that bore through flesh. How can we know that Zeng and Shi were not the arrow-tips of Jie and Robber Zhi?\n\nTherefore it is said: \"Cut off sageliness, cast aside wisdom, and the world will be greatly ordered.\"\n\nAfter Yellow Emperor had reigned as Son of Heaven for nineteen years, his decrees reached throughout the land. Hearing that Guangchengzi dwelt upon Mount Kongtong, he went to see him and said: \"I have heard that you have attained the perfect Dao. I venture to ask: what is the essence of the perfect Dao? I wish to draw forth the essence of Heaven and Earth to aid the five grains and nourish the people. I also wish to regulate the Yin and Yang to bring all living things to fulfillment. How may this be done?\"\n\nGuangchengzi replied: \"What you wish to inquire about is the substance of things; what you wish to regulate is the ruin of things. Since you have governed the world, the clouds have rained without gathering, the grasses and trees have withered without yellowing, and the light of the sun and moon has grown ever more dim. Your heart, so full of cunning and flattery, is unfit to speak of the perfect Dao.\"\n\nThe Yellow Emperor withdrew, relinquished the world, built a solitary chamber, spread a mat of white cogon grass, and lived in seclusion. Then he returned to seek Guangchengzi again. Guangchengzi lay with his head to the south, and the Yellow Emperor approached from the north, crawling forward on his knees. Bowing twice, he touched his forehead to the ground and asked: \"I have heard that you have attained the perfect Dao. I venture to ask: how may one cultivate the body to attain long life?\"\n\nGuangchengzi rose with a start and said: \"An excellent question! Come, and I will tell you of the perfect Dao. The essence of the perfect Dao is profound and obscure; its utmost reaches are dark and silent. See nothing, hear nothing, hold fast to the spirit in stillness, and the body will right itself. Be still, be pure; do not weary your body, do not agitate your essence, and you may attain long life. Let your eyes see nothing, your ears hear nothing, your heart know nothing, and your spirit will guard your body, and your body will attain long life. Guard your inner self, restrain your outer self, and excess knowledge will bring ruin. I have guided you to the source of great brightness, to the origin of utmost Yang. I have led you through the gate of profound obscurity, to the origin of utmost Yin. Heaven and Earth have their offices, Yin and Yang have their storehouses. Guard your body well, and things will flourish of themselves. I preserve the One and abide in harmony; thus I have cultivated my body for one thousand two hundred years, and my form has never decayed.\"\n\nThe Yellow Emperor bowed twice, touching his forehead to the ground, and said: \"Guangchengzi is like Heaven itself!\"\n\nGuangchengzi said: \"Come, and I will tell you more. Those things are inexhaustible, yet men all take them to be finite; those things are unfathomable, yet men all take them to be limited. Those who attain my Dao may become emperors above and kings below; those who lose my Dao may see light above yet become earth below. Now all the myriad creatures are born from the earth and return to the earth. Therefore I will leave you and enter the gate of the inexhaustible, to wander in the boundless wilds. I share the light of the sun and moon, I endure with Heaven and Earth. Let those who come near me be enlightened; let those who depart from me be benighted. Let all men perish, yet I alone endure.\"\n\nCloud General was roaming eastward when he passed the branches of the whirlwind tree and happened upon Hong Meng. Hong Meng was just then slapping his thighs and leaping about in play. When Cloud General saw him, he stopped in astonishment and stood in awe, saying: \"Old sir, who are you? What are you doing here?\"\n\nHong Meng continued slapping his thighs and leaping without pause. He replied to Cloud General: \"Roaming.\"\n\nCloud General said: \"I wish to ask you something.\"\n\nHong Meng looked up at Cloud General and said: \"Ah!\"\n\nCloud General said: \"The qi of Heaven is not harmonious, the qi of Earth is pent up, the six qi are not balanced, the four seasons are out of order. Now I wish to blend the essence of the six qi to nurture all living things. How may this be done?\"\n\nHong Meng continued slapping his thighs and leaping, shaking his head and saying: \"I do not know! I do not know!\" Cloud General could not press his question.\n\nThree years later, roaming again, Cloud General passed through the wilds of Song and once more encountered Hong Meng. Overjoyed, Cloud General hastened forward and said: \"Has Heaven forgotten me? Has Heaven forgotten me?\" He bowed twice, touching his head to the ground, and entreated Hong Meng for instruction.\n\nHong Meng replied: \"Roaming freely, knowing not what I seek; wandering wildly, knowing not where I go. The roamer is carefree, observing the uncontrived. What do I know?\"\n\nCloud General said: \"I too believed myself to be wandering wildly, yet the people follow wherever I go. I cannot be free of the people—now they have become my shackles. I wish to hear but a single word.\"\n\nHong Meng said: \"To disrupt the warp of Heaven, to violate the nature of things, even the mysterious workings of Heaven cannot bring them to completion. To scatter the herds of beasts, so that birds all cry at night; to bring calamity upon grasses and trees, disaster upon insects—alas, these are the faults of those who govern men.\"\n\nCloud General said: \"Then what am I to do?\"\n\nHong Meng said: \"Alas, how poisonous! Return in bewildered exhaustion.\"\n\nCloud General said: \"I have met with Heaven’s difficulty. I wish to hear but a single word.\"\n\nHong Meng said: \"Alas, nurture the heart. Abide in non-action, and things will transform of themselves. Cast off your form, expel your cleverness, forget both self and things, and merge with the great sameness of the marshlands. Release the heart, liberate the spirit, and become as though soulless. The ten thousand things, teeming and indistinct, each return to their root, each return to their root without knowing it. Vast and undifferentiated, they remain thus all their lives. If one claims to know it, one has already departed from it. Do not inquire into their names, do not scrutinize their natures—things arise of themselves.\"\n\nCloud General said: \"Heaven has bestowed virtue upon me, shown me the way of silence. Through personal seeking, I have now attained it.\" He bowed twice, touching his head to the ground, then rose and took his leave.\n\nThe common people all delight in those who are like themselves and despise those who differ. Those who desire likeness and reject difference do so with the intent of standing out from the crowd. Yet how can one who seeks to stand out from the crowd ever truly do so? Relying on the multitude for tranquility, what one hears will not surpass the skills of the many. Yet those who would govern the realm of men grasp at the benefits of the Three Kings while blind to their perils. This is to gamble with the realm of men—how often can one gamble and not lose it? The chance of preserving the realm is less than one in ten thousand, while the risk of losing it is such that a single failure brings ten thousandfold ruin. Alas, how ignorant are those who hold land!\n\nThose who hold land possess a great thing. Possessing a great thing, one must not be constrained by it. Only by not being constrained by things can one master things. He who understands that the master of things is not a thing himself—how could his governance be limited to the realm and its people? Moving in and out of the six directions, roaming the nine provinces, coming and going alone—this is called possessing singularity. One who possesses singularity is called most noble.\n\nThe teaching of the great person is like the shadow following form, the echo responding to sound. When questioned, they answer, exhausting all that is in their heart, becoming the counterpart of all under Heaven. They dwell in the realm of no echo, move in the realm of no direction. They grasp you and lead you through the bustling throng, roaming without end. Entering and exiting without hindrance, they share no beginning with the sun. They praise and discuss the forms of the body, merging with the great sameness, the great sameness without self. Without self, how can there be possession? Those who perceive possession are the gentlemen of old; those who perceive non-possession are friends of Heaven and Earth.\n\nThat which is lowly yet cannot be shunned is things; that which is humble yet cannot be disregarded is the people; that which is hidden yet cannot be left undone is affairs; that which is coarse yet cannot be set forth is law; that which is distant yet cannot be neglected is righteousness; that which is intimate yet cannot be narrow is benevolence; that which is measured yet cannot be unaccumulated is ritual; that which is centered yet cannot be unexalted is virtue; that which is one yet cannot be unchanging is the Dao; that which is spirit yet cannot be left undone is Heaven.\n\nThus, the sage observes Heaven yet does not assist, completes virtue yet is not burdened, emerges from the Dao yet does not scheme, meets benevolence yet does not rely on it, approaches righteousness yet does not accumulate it, responds to ritual yet does not conceal, engages with affairs yet does not decline, aligns with law yet is not disordered, depends on the people yet does not belittle them, follows things yet does not abandon them. Things are not worth acting upon, yet they cannot be left undone. One who does not understand Heaven is not pure in virtue; one who does not comprehend the Dao has no means to proceed. Alas, those who do not understand the Dao!\n\nWhat is the Dao? There is the Dao of Heaven and the Dao of Man. That which is revered through non-action is the Dao of Heaven; that which is burdened through action is the Dao of Man. The ruler follows the Dao of Heaven; the minister follows the Dao of Man. The Dao of Heaven and the Dao of Man are vastly different—this must not go unexamined.\n\n* * *\n\nThough Heaven and Earth are vast, their transformations are uniform; though the ten thousand things are many, their governance is one; though the masses of people are numerous, their lord is the ruler. The ruler originates in virtue and is completed by Heaven. Thus it is said: The ancient rulers of the world under Heaven practiced non-action, embodying only the virtue of Heaven.\n\nViewing words through the Dao, the rulers of the world are rectified; viewing distinctions through the Dao, the duties of ruler and minister are clarified; viewing abilities through the Dao, the offices of the world are well-ordered; viewing broadly through the Dao, the responses of the ten thousand things are complete. Thus, that which penetrates Heaven and Earth is virtue; that which moves through the ten thousand things is the Dao; that which governs people is affairs; that which involves skill is technique.\n\nThe arts are encompassed by affairs, affairs by righteousness, righteousness by virtue, virtue by the Dao, and the Dao by Heaven. Thus it is said: The ancients who nurtured the world under Heaven had no desires, and the world was sufficient; they practiced non-action, and the ten thousand things were transformed; they were profound and still, and the hundred clans were settled.\n\nThe *Record* states: \"Penetrate the One, and the ten thousand affairs are complete; attain effortless mastery, and even ghosts and spirits submit.\" The Master said: \"The Dao—it covers and sustains the ten thousand things, vast and boundless! How great it is! The noble person cannot but examine his heart in this regard.\"\n\nNon-action in doing is called Heaven; non-action in speaking is called virtue; loving people and benefiting things is called benevolence; uniting differences in sameness is called greatness; acting without eccentricity is called magnanimity; possessing the ten thousand differences is called wealth. Thus, holding fast to virtue is called discipline; the completion of virtue is called establishment; following the Dao is called perfection; not allowing things to thwart one’s will is called integrity.\n\nWhen the noble person is enlightened regarding these ten, his mind’s capacity for affairs is profound, and his engagement with the ten thousand things is effortless. Such a one hides gold in the mountains and pearls in the depths, neither valuing wealth nor seeking nobility and riches. He does not rejoice in long life nor grieve over early death; he is not honored by success nor ashamed by poverty. He does not claim the world’s benefits as his private share, nor does he regard ruling the world as a position of glory. When one is illustrious, one is luminous—all things are as a single storehouse, and death and life share the same form.\n\nThe Master said: \"The Dao—profound is its abode, limpid is its clarity. Even metal and stone cannot sound without it. Thus, metal and stone have voices, yet without being struck, they do not ring. Who can determine the ten thousand things?\"\n\nThe person of royal virtue moves plainly and feels shame at being entangled in affairs; he establishes the root and origin and knows how to commune with the spirit. Thus, his virtue is vast, and his heart’s emanations are gathered by things. Therefore, form does not arise without the Dao, nor is life illuminated without virtue. Preserving form and exhausting life, establishing virtue and illuminating the Dao—is this not the person of royal virtue?\n\nVast and unbounded, suddenly emerging, dynamically moving—when the ten thousand things follow him, this is called the person of royal virtue. He sees in darkness and hears in silence. Within darkness, he alone perceives the dawn; within silence, he alone hears harmony. Thus, the deeper one delves, the more one can comprehend things; the more spiritually attuned one becomes, the more one can grasp the essence.\n\nTherefore, in his interaction with the ten thousand things, he is utterly non-substantial yet meets their needs; he roams freely yet binds them to their origins. Great and small, long and short, distant and near.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor roamed north of the Red Water and ascended the heights of Mount Kunlun to gaze southward. Upon returning, he lost his dark pearl. He sent Knowledge to seek it, but it was not found; he sent Li Zhu to seek it, but it was not found; he sent Chi Gou to seek it, but it was not found. Only Xiang Wang obtained it. The Yellow Emperor said: \"How strange! Only Xiang Wang could retrieve it.\"\n\nYao’s teacher was Xu You; Xu You’s teacher was Nie Que; Nie Que’s teacher was Wang Ni; Wang Ni’s teacher was Pi Yi.\n\nYao asked Xu You: \"Could Nie Que be matched with Heaven? I would rely on Wang Ni to assess him.\" Xu You said: \"How perilous it would be to burden the world with him! Nie Que’s nature is keenly intelligent, quick-witted, and surpasses others, yet he still takes humanity as his measure of Heaven. He is strict in preventing transgressions but does not understand their source. Could he be matched with Heaven? He would ride upon people and lose Heaven. He would prioritize the self and differentiate forms, exalt knowledge and rush like fire, be driven by threads of affairs, be ensnared by things, look in all directions for responses, adapt to every contingency, and transform with things without constancy. How could he be matched with Heaven? Nevertheless, he has a lineage and ancestors; he could be a father to the masses but not the father of fathers. Governance under him would lead to disorder, inviting calamity from those who face north and treachery from those who face south.\"\n\nYao observed Hua. Hua addressed Yao, saying: \"Ah! A sage! Let me pray for blessings upon the sage: may the sage live long.\" Yao declined. \"May the sage be rich.\" Yao declined. \"May the sage have many sons.\" Yao declined. Hua said: \"Long life, wealth, and many sons—these are what people desire. Why do you alone not desire them?\" Yao said: \"Many sons bring many fears; wealth brings many affairs; long life brings many humiliations. These three are not means to cultivate virtue, so I decline.\"\n\nHua said: \"At first, I took you for a sage, but now you are merely a gentleman. Heaven generates the ten thousand people and must assign them duties. If one has many sons and assigns them duties, what fear is there? If one is rich and distributes it among others, what affairs remain? The sage dwells like a quail and eats like a fledgling, moves like a bird without ostentation. When the world is ordered, he flourishes with all things; when the world is disordered, he cultivates virtue and retreats into seclusion. After a thousand years, weary of the world, he departs and ascends in weariness, riding the white clouds to the realm of the Emperor. The three calamities do not reach him, and his person remains free from misfortune. What humiliation is there?\"\n\nHua departed. Yao followed him, saying: \"May I ask a question?\" Hua said: \"Withdraw.\"\n\nWhen Yao governed the world, Bo Cheng Zi Gao was enfeoffed as a lord. When Yao ceded the throne to Shun, and Shun to Yu, Bo Cheng Zi Gao resigned his lordship to farm. Yu went to see him and found him plowing in the fields. Yu hastened to the lower position, stood, and asked: \"In the past, when Yao governed the world, you were enfeoffed as a lord. When Yao ceded the throne to Shun, and Shun to me, you resigned your lordship to farm. May I ask the reason?\"\n\nBo Cheng Zi Gao said: \"In the past, when Yao governed the world, he did not reward yet the people were encouraged; he did not punish yet the people were in awe. Now you reward and punish, yet the people lack benevolence. Virtue has declined from this point, and punishments have been established from this point—disorder for later generations begins here.\"\n\nWhen you, sir, close your path and act perversely, do not implicate my affairs. He continued plowing, damp with sweat, without looking back.\n\nIn the Great Beginning, there was Nonbeing; there was no being, no name. From the One arose the One, yet it had no form. When things received what enabled them to live, this was called *virtue*; when the formless had divisions, yet remained thus without inquiry, this was called *ming*; when movement and stillness gave rise to things, and things took form and principle, this was called *shape*; when shape and body preserved spirit, each with its own pattern, this was called *nature*. Cultivating nature returns to virtue; when virtue reaches its fullness, it merges with the beginning. This merging is emptiness; emptiness is vastness. The beak joins in harmony; when the beak harmonizes, it unites with Heaven and Earth. This union is profound and subtle, seeming foolish and dull—this is called *mysterious virtue*, merging with the Great Compliance.\n\nThe Master turned to Lao Cong and said: \"There is one who governs the Dao as if following another—what is permissible, what is not; what is so, what is not. A debater once said, 'Separating hardness and whiteness is like hanging them apart.' If this is so, can one be called a sage?\"\n\nLao Cong replied: \"This is the toil of clerks bound by skills, wearing out body and mind. A dog trained to catch raccoons grows anxious; a monkey brought from the mountains is skilled in climbing. Qiu, I tell you what you cannot hear and speak what you cannot say. Of those with heads and feet but no heart or ears, there are many; of those with form and those without form or shape who all exist, there are none. Their movement and stillness, their death and life, their decline and rise—these are not their true essence. When governance lies with man, forgetting things and forgetting Heaven, this is called forgetting oneself. One who forgets himself is said to enter into Heaven.\"\n\nJiang Wenqiao saw Ji Che and said: \"The Lord of Lu told me, 'I beg to receive your instruction.' I could not decline his command. Having already told him, I do not know if it was fitting. Allow me to present it again. I said to the Lord of Lu, 'You must practice reverence and frugality, promote those who are publicly loyal and eliminate private favoritism—then who among the people would dare not be harmonious?'\"\n\nJi Che laughed heartily and said: \"If this is what you said, sir, then your words on the virtue of emperors and kings are like a mantis raising its arms to block a chariot wheel—certainly unequal to the task. Moreover, if this is so, then one who acts thus places himself in peril. His observation tower is high, and many things will come—those who throw themselves over the edge will be many.\"\n\nJiang Wenqiao was startled and said in alarm: \"I am utterly lost in your words, sir. Nevertheless, I wish to hear the principles of your teaching.\"\n\nJi Che said: \"When the Great Sage governs the world, he unsettles the people’s hearts, transforming their teachings and changing their customs. He eradicates their predatory hearts and advances their solitary aspirations, as if by nature’s own doing, and the people do not know why it is so. How could this be like the way Yao and Shun taught the people, laboring like a brother to guide them? He desires that all merge in virtue, and their hearts dwell in stillness.\"\n\nZigong traveled south to Chu and, on his return to Jin, passed through Hanyin. There he saw an old man working in his garden, digging a tunnel to enter a well, then hoisting a jar to draw water and irrigate his plots. He toiled laboriously, yet his results were meager.\n\nZigong said, \"There is a device here that can irrigate a hundred plots in a day, requiring little effort yet yielding great results. Would you not wish to use it?\"\n\nThe gardener looked up and asked, \"How does it work?\"\n\nZigong replied, \"Carve wood into a machine—heavy at the rear, light at the front—drawing water as if by suction. It gushes forth like boiling water, and its name is the well-sweep.\"\n\nThe gardener flushed with anger, laughed, and said, \"I have heard from my teacher that those who possess mechanical devices must engage in mechanical affairs, and those who engage in mechanical affairs must harbor mechanical minds. When a mechanical mind resides in the breast, purity and whiteness are incomplete. When purity and whiteness are incomplete, the spirit’s life is unsettled. One whose spirit’s life is unsettled is not borne by the Dao. I am not ignorant of such things—I am ashamed to do them.\"\n\nZigong, abashed, lowered his head and made no reply. After a moment, the gardener asked, \"What are you doing here?\"\n\nZigong said, \"I am a disciple of Confucius.\"\n\nThe gardener replied, \"Are you not one of those who broadly study to emulate the sages, striving to surpass the multitude, playing the zither and singing mournful songs to sell your reputation to the world? You are about to forget your spirit and qi, cast aside your bodily form, yet you barely manage yourself—how could you have leisure to govern the world? Be on your way and do not hinder my work.\"\n\nZigong, humbled and discomfited, lost his color and walked away crestfallen. After thirty li, he gradually recovered. His disciples asked, \"Who was that man earlier? Why did you change countenance and lose composure, remaining unsettled for the rest of the day?\"\n\nZigong said, \"At first, I thought there was only one true person in the world, but I did not know there was another like him. I have heard from the Master that in affairs, one seeks what is possible; in achievements, one seeks completion. To expend little effort and gain much is the Way of the sage. Yet this is not so. One who holds to the Dao has complete virtue; one with complete virtue has complete form; one with complete form has complete spirit. One with complete spirit—this is the Way of the sage. Entrusted with life, he moves among the people yet does not know where he is going, so profound and whole is he. One must forget the mind that seeks merit, profit, and cleverness. As for such a person, if it is not his aspiration, he does not go; if it is not his heart, he does not act. Though the world praises him, if it aligns with his principles, he remains unmoved; though the world condemns him, if it contradicts his principles, he remains unshaken. The world’s praise or blame neither adds nor detracts—this is what is called a person of complete virtue. I am but a man tossed by the winds and waves.\"\n\nReturning to Lu, he told Confucius what had happened. Confucius said, \"He is one who temporarily practices the arts of Hundun’s school. He knows one aspect but not the other; he cultivates his inner self but neglects his outer conduct. One who is clear and enters simplicity, who acts without contrivance and returns to the uncarved block, who embodies nature and embraces the spirit, moving among the customs of the world—would you be so utterly astonished? Moreover, the arts of Hundun’s school—how could you or I truly understand them?\"\n\nZhun Mang was traveling east to the Great Abyss when he encountered Yuan Feng on the shores of the Eastern Sea. Yuan Feng asked, \"Where are you going?\"\n\nZhun Mang replied, \"To the Great Abyss.\"\n\nYuan Feng asked, \"What will you do there?\"\n\nZhun Mang said, \"The Great Abyss is such a thing: pour into it, and it is never full; draw from it, and it is never exhausted. I will wander there.\"\n\nYuan Feng said, \"Do you have no concern for the people with horizontal eyes? I wish to hear about sagely governance.\"\n\nZhun Mang said, \"Sagely governance? Offices are bestowed without error, promotions are made without misjudgment, all circumstances are fully seen, and actions are taken accordingly. Words and deeds arise naturally, and the world is transformed. With a wave of the hand or a glance, the people of the four directions all come—this is called sagely governance. I wish to hear about the virtuous person.\"\n\nZhun Mang said, \"The virtuous person dwells without thought, moves without calculation, and does not harbor right or wrong, beauty or ugliness. Within the four seas, all rejoice in shared benefit and find peace in shared provision. He is as forlorn as an infant who has lost its mother, as bewildered as a traveler who has lost his way. Wealth and resources are abundant, yet he does not know their source; food and drink are sufficient, yet he does not know their origin—this is the bearing of the virtuous person. I wish to hear about the spirit person.\"\n\nZhun Mang said, \"The supreme spirit person rides the light, and form perishes with him—this is called illuminating the vast. He fulfills his mandate and exhausts his nature, delighting in heaven and earth, and all things dissolve. The myriad things return to their nature—this is called the undifferentiated darkness.\"\n\nMen Wu Gui and Chi Zhang Manji observed the army of King Wu. Chi Zhang Manji said, \"He does not measure up to the Yu clan—hence he has encountered this trouble.\"\n\nMen Wu Gui said, \"Was the world well-governed before the Yu clan governed it? Or did it fall into chaos and then they brought order?\"\n\nChi Zhang Manji said, \"The world being well-governed is the wish—why calculate whether it was the Yu clan? The Yu clan’s remedies are like treating sores by shaving the head and applying medicine, or curing illness by seeking a physician. A filial son administers medicine to his compassionate father with a pained expression—sages are ashamed of this. In the age of utmost virtue, worthies are not esteemed, abilities are not employed. Rulers are like the tips of branches, and the people are like wild deer. They are upright yet do not know it as righteousness, they love one another yet do not know it as benevolence, they are sincere yet do not know it as loyalty, they are trustworthy yet do not know it as faithfulness. They move and work together without considering it a favor. Thus, their actions leave no traces, and their affairs leave no record. Filial sons do not flatter their parents, loyal ministers do not fawn on their rulers—this is the height of ministerial conduct. If a son agrees with his parents’ words and finds their actions good, the world calls him an unworthy son. If a minister agrees with his ruler’s words and finds his actions good, the world calls him an unworthy minister. Yet how do we know this must be so?\"\n\nWhen the world calls right what is right and good what is good, it does not deem such people flatterers. Yet does this mean the world holds parents in stricter reverence than rulers? Call a man a flatterer, and he bristles with indignation; call him a sycophant, and his face darkens with anger. Yet all his life he flatters others, all his life he sycophants—gathering crowds with clever parables and polished words, his beginning and end, root and branch, never once held to account. He drapes himself in robes, adorns himself with colors, assumes the manners of a guest, and fawns upon his age, yet never calls himself a flatterer. He joins the company of such men, aligning right and wrong with them, yet never calls himself one of the crowd. This is the height of folly.\n\nTo recognize one’s folly is not the greatest folly; to recognize one’s confusion is not the greatest confusion. The truly confused never awaken in their lifetime; the truly foolish never gain wisdom. If three walk together and one is confused, the destination may still be reached, for confusion is in the minority. If two are confused, the journey is labored and the goal unattained, for confusion prevails. Now, with the whole world confused, though I have a direction I seek, how can it be attained? Is this not lamentable?\n\nGrand music does not enter the ears of the village; but let the strains of *Zhe Yang* or *Huang Hua* sound, and they burst into laughter. Thus, lofty words do not lodge in the hearts of the crowd; profound speech remains unspoken, for common speech prevails. With two hobbling along in confusion, the destination is lost. Now, with the whole world confused, though I have a direction I seek, how can it be attained? Knowing it cannot be attained yet forcing the matter is yet another confusion. Better to let it go and not press further. If one does not press, who shares the worry?\n\nA man afflicted with leprosy gives birth to a child in the dead of night. He hastily lights a torch to examine it, anxious lest it resemble himself. A hundred-year-old tree is felled to carve sacrificial goblets, painted in green and yellow with intricate designs—yet its offcuts lie discarded in the ditch. Compare the goblet to the offcut in the ditch: one is deemed beautiful, the other ugly, yet both have lost their original nature. Zeng and Shi may differ in their conduct of righteousness, yet their loss of nature is the same.\n\nThere are five ways in which nature is lost:\nFirst, the five colors dazzle the eyes, blinding them;\nSecond, the five sounds deafen the ears, dulling them;\nThird, the five odors cloy the nose, stupefying the senses;\nFourth, the five flavors cloy the palate, deadening it;\nFifth, preferences and aversions agitate the heart, scattering the spirit.\nThese five are all harms to life.\n\nYet Yang Zhu and Mo Di, having strayed from the Dao, claim to have attained it—this is not what I call attainment. If being trapped is called attainment, then the turtledove and crow in a cage may also be said to have attained it. Moreover, chasing after preferences and aversions, colors and sounds, to clutter the inner self; donning ceremonial caps and sashes to constrain the outer form; inwardly propped up by a cage of desires, outwardly bound by layers of restraint; standing entangled in these bonds, believing oneself to have attained—this is like a convict with bound arms and shackled fingers, or a tiger and leopard in a sack or cage, yet claiming to have attained.\n\n---\n\nThe Dao of Heaven moves without accumulation, and so the myriad things are completed; the Dao of the Emperor moves without accumulation, and so the world submits; the Dao of the Sage moves without accumulation, and so the realm obeys. Those who understand Heaven and penetrate the Sage, whose six senses and four limbs align with the virtue of emperors and kings—their self-cultivation is so profound that nothing disturbs their tranquility.\n\nThe Sage’s stillness is not because stillness is good, but because nothing in the myriad things can disturb his heart, and so he is still. When water is still, it clearly mirrors the brows and beard, its level surface serving as a standard—even master craftsmen take it as their model. If still water can be so clear, how much more the spirit? The Sage’s heart is still, a mirror to Heaven and Earth, a reflection of the myriad things.\n\nEmptiness, stillness, tranquility, silence, and non-action—these are the level of Heaven and Earth, the perfection of the Dao and virtue. Thus, emperors, kings, and sages rest in them. In rest, there is emptiness; in emptiness, there is fullness; in fullness, there is order. In emptiness, there is stillness; in stillness, there is movement; in movement, there is attainment. In stillness, there is non-action; in non-action, those who handle affairs are held responsible. In non-action, there is ease; in ease, worries and troubles cannot take hold, and one’s years are long.\n\nEmptiness, stillness, tranquility, silence, and non-action are the root of the myriad things. Understanding this and ruling the south, one becomes a Yao as sovereign; understanding this and serving the north, one becomes a Shun as minister. Applying this in high office, it is the virtue of emperors, kings, and the Son of Heaven; applying this in lowly station, it is the Dao of the obscure sage and unadorned king. Retiring with this and wandering freely among rivers and seas, recluses of the mountains and forests submit to it; advancing with this to govern the world, one’s achievements are great, one’s name illustrious, and the world is unified.\n\nIn stillness, one is a sage; in action, one is a king. In non-action, one is revered; in simplicity, no one in the world can rival one’s beauty. Those who clearly understand the virtue of Heaven and Earth—this is called the great root, the great foundation, harmony with Heaven. This is how one harmonizes the world, how one harmonizes with others. Harmonizing with others is called human joy; harmonizing with Heaven is called Heavenly joy.\n\nZhuangzi said: \"O my master! O my master! You order the myriad things yet are not tyrannical, your blessings extend to ten thousand generations yet are not called benevolence, you are older than high antiquity yet are not called long-lived, you cover and bear Heaven and Earth, carve and shape the myriad forms yet are not called skillful—this is called Heavenly joy. Thus, those who know Heavenly joy move with the Heavenly course in life and transform with things in death. In stillness, they share the virtue of yin; in movement, they flow with the waves of yang. Therefore, those who know Heavenly joy harbor no resentment from Heaven, no blame from others, no burden from things, no reproach from spirits.\n\nThus, in movement, they are like Heaven; in stillness, like Earth. With a single mind settled, they rule the world. Their spirits suffer no haunting, their souls no fatigue. With a single mind settled, the myriad things submit.\n\nThe ghost does not afflict them, the soul does not weary—with a single mind settled, the myriad things yield.\"\n\nSpeech that with emptiness and stillness extends to Heaven and Earth, penetrating the myriad things—this is called Heavenly joy. Heavenly joy is the heart of the sage, by which they nurture all under Heaven.\n\nThe virtue of emperors and kings takes Heaven and Earth as its model, the Dao and virtue as its master, and non-action as its constant. In non-action, they employ all under Heaven with abundance; in action, they are employed by all under Heaven yet remain insufficient. Thus, the ancients prized non-action.\n\nWhen the superior practices non-action, the inferior also practices non-action—this is the inferior sharing the same virtue as the superior. When the inferior shares the same virtue as the superior, they do not serve as subjects. When the inferior acts, the superior also acts—this is the superior sharing the same path as the inferior. When the superior shares the same path as the inferior, they do not rule as lords. The superior must practice non-action to employ all under Heaven; the inferior must act to be employed by all under Heaven—this is the unchanging Dao.\n\nThus, the ancient kings of all under Heaven, though their knowledge embraced Heaven and Earth, did not rely on their own deliberation; though their eloquence adorned the myriad things, they did not rely on their own persuasion; though their abilities exhausted the world within the seas, they did not rely on their own efforts. Heaven does not produce, yet the myriad things transform; Earth does not grow, yet the myriad things are nurtured; emperors and kings practice non-action, yet all under Heaven achieves success.\n\nThus, nothing is more spirit-like than Heaven, nothing more abundant than Earth, nothing greater than emperors and kings. Therefore, the virtue of emperors and kings matches Heaven and Earth. This is the Dao of riding Heaven and Earth, driving the myriad things, and employing the hands of others.\n\nThe root lies with the superior, the branches with the inferior; the essential lies with the ruler, the details with the ministers. The deployment of the three armies and five weapons is the least of virtues; rewards and punishments, advantages and harms, the application of the five punishments—these are the least of teachings. Rituals, laws, measures, and standards, the comparison and elaboration of names—these are the least of governance. The sounds of bells and drums, the forms of feathered banners—these are the least of music. Mourning garments of varying degrees, the extremes of ritual attire—these are the least of returning to the root.\n\nThese five least things require the movement of spirit and the activation of the heart’s art before they can be followed. The lesser scholars of later times have had these, yet they are not what should come first.\n\nThe ruler leads and the minister follows; the father leads and the son follows; the elder brother leads and the younger brother follows; the elder leads and the younger follows; the man leads and the woman follows; the husband leads and the wife follows. This precedence of honor and sequence is the course of Heaven and Earth, and thus the sage takes it as their model.\n\nHeaven is honored and Earth is lowly—this is the position of spirit and clarity. Spring and summer come first, autumn and winter follow—this is the sequence of the four seasons. The myriad things arise and take form, their flourishing and decline, their transformations and flows—all follow this pattern. If even Heaven and Earth, most spirit-like, have a sequence of honor and precedence, how much more so does the human Dao?\n\nIn ancestral temples, kinship is honored; in court, honor is honored; in villages, seniority is honored; in conduct, worthiness is honored—this is the sequence of the great Dao. To speak of the Dao yet violate its sequence is not the true Dao; to speak of the Dao yet not follow the Dao—how can one grasp the Dao?\n\nThus, the ancients who illuminated the great Dao first illuminated Heaven, then followed with the Dao and virtue. Once the Dao and virtue were illuminated, they followed with benevolence and righteousness. Once benevolence and righteousness were illuminated, they followed with the division of duties. Once the division of duties was illuminated, they followed with names and punishments. Once names and punishments were illuminated, they followed with delegation and responsibility. Once delegation and responsibility were illuminated, they followed with investigation and reflection. Once investigation and reflection were illuminated, they followed with right and wrong. Once right and wrong were illuminated, they followed with rewards and punishments.\n\nOnce rewards and punishments were clear, the foolish and the wise were placed appropriately, the noble and the base assumed their positions, the benevolent and the worthless followed their natures. Abilities were necessarily distinguished, names necessarily followed. With this, they served their superiors, nurtured their inferiors, governed things, and cultivated themselves. Without employing cunning schemes, they necessarily returned to the Heavenly. This is called Great Peace, the ultimate of governance.\n\nThus, the *Book* says: \"There are punishments and names.\" Punishments and names existed among the ancients, yet they were not what should come first. Those who spoke of the great Dao in ancient times could raise the matter of punishments and names after five changes, and speak of rewards and punishments after nine changes.\n\nTo abruptly speak of punishments and names is to not know their root; to abruptly speak of rewards and punishments is to not know their beginning. To speak of the Dao and then discourse on it, to be within the Dao and then expound on it—these are what people govern, how can they govern others? To abruptly speak of punishments and names, rewards and punishments—this is to possess the tools of governance, not the Dao of governance. They can be employed in all under Heaven, but are insufficient to employ all under Heaven. These are called debaters, people of partial understanding.\n\nRituals, laws, measures, and standards, the comparison and elaboration of names—these existed among the ancients. They are how the inferior serve the superior, not how the superior nurture the inferior.\n\nIn ancient times, Shun asked Yao: \"How does the Son of Heaven employ his heart?\" Yao said: \"I do not slight the bereft, do not abandon the destitute, grieve for the dead, delight in the young, and pity women. This is how I employ my heart.\" Shun said: \"Admirable, yet not great.\" Yao said: \"Then what should it be?\" Shun said: \"To embody Heavenly virtue and emerge in tranquility, with the sun and moon shining and the four seasons proceeding, like the constancy of day and night, with clouds moving and rain falling.\"\n\nYao said: \"How entangled and troubled! You harmonize with Heaven; I harmonize with man.\" Now, Heaven and Earth are what the ancients deemed greatest, what the Yellow Emperor, Yao, and Shun all praised together. Thus, the ancient kings of all under Heaven—what did they do? They simply followed Heaven and Earth.\n\nConfucius traveled west to deposit his books in the Zhou court. Zilu advised: \"I have heard that the Zhou’s Keeper of Archives, an elder named Lao Dan, has resigned and returned home. If you wish to deposit your books, you might try visiting him.\" Confucius said: \"Very well.\" He went to see Lao Dan, but Lao Dan did not consent. Thereupon, Confucius expounded the *Twelve Classics* to refute Lao Dan’s arguments, saying: \"Great indeed! I wish to hear your thoughts.\" Lao Dan said: \"Tell me, are benevolence and righteousness part of human nature?\" Confucius said: \"Yes.\"\n\nThe noble man cannot be without benevolence, for he would not be complete; he cannot be without righteousness, for he would not endure. Benevolence and righteousness are the true nature of the realized person—what more is there to be done?\"\n\nLao Dan said: \"May I ask, what do you mean by benevolence and righteousness?\"\nConfucius said: \"Harmony with all things at heart, universal love without partiality—this is the essence of benevolence and righteousness.\"\nLao Dan said: \"Alas! Nearly ruinous are such later words. Is not universal love impractical? Where there is no partiality, there is still partiality. If you, Master, wish to ensure that all under Heaven lose nothing of their natural guidance, then know this: Heaven and Earth have their constancy, the sun and moon their brightness, the stars and constellations their order, birds and beasts their flocks, trees and plants their uprightness. Follow virtue in your conduct, tread the Dao in your steps—this is already perfection. Why then do you clamorously brandish benevolence and righteousness like one beating a drum in search of a lost child? Ah! You, Master, confuse human nature.\"\n\nShi Chengqi, having met Laozi, asked: \"I have heard that you, Master, are a sage. I did not hesitate to travel a great distance, wishing to see you. For a hundred days I journeyed, my calloused feet bearing the dust, never daring to rest. Now I observe you, and you are no sage.\"\n\nThe mouse burrows have surplus greens, yet you cast aside your younger sister—this is unkindness. Before you, food lies uneaten, both raw and cooked, yet you hoard without end.\"\n\nLaozi remained silent, offering no response. The next day, Shi Chengqi returned and said, \"Yesterday, I reproached you, but now my heart is settled. Why is this?\"\n\nLaozi replied, \"Those who are cunning, wise, and spiritually sagacious—I believed myself free of such traits. In the past, when you called me an ox, I accepted the name of ox; when you called me a horse, I accepted the name of horse. If one truly possesses a nature, yet refuses the name others give, one invites calamity anew. My garb is ever my garb, yet I do not wear it because it is a garb.\"\n\nShi Chengqi stepped sideways to avoid his shadow, then advanced and asked, \"How should one cultivate the self?\"\n\nLaozi said, \"Your bearing is haughty, your gaze piercing, your brow knitted, your mouth tightly sealed, your demeanor rigid—like a horse reined in to a halt. Movement with restraint, action like a crossbow’s trigger, scrutiny with precision, cleverness that perceives excess—all this betrays a lack of trust. At the borderlands, there is a man known as a thief.\n\nThe Dao, in its vastness, does not end; in its minuteness, it does not omit. Thus, the ten thousand things are complete. Boundless is its capacity to embrace all; unfathomable is its depth. Forms, virtue, benevolence, and righteousness are but the remnants of spirit—who but the perfected person can stabilize them? The perfected person possesses the world, yet this is no great matter, nor does it burden him. Though the world strives and strains, he does not follow; though he discerns the unreal, he does not shift for gain. He exhausts the true nature of things and guards their root. Thus, he stands beyond Heaven and Earth, leaves the ten thousand things behind, and his spirit is never constrained.\n\nIn accord with the Dao, in harmony with virtue, he retreats from benevolence and righteousness, sets aside rites and music—the perfected person’s heart is thus settled. The world values the Dao as found in books. Yet books are but words, and words have their value. What is valued in words is their meaning, and meaning has its source. But the source of meaning cannot be conveyed in speech, and the world, mistakenly, prizes the transmission of words in books. Though the world values them, they are not truly valuable, for what they value is not true value.\n\nWhat can be seen are forms and colors; what can be heard are names and sounds. Alas! The world believes that forms, colors, names, and sounds suffice to grasp the essence of things. Yet if forms, colors, names, and sounds truly do not suffice, then those who know do not speak, and those who speak do not know—how could the world recognize this?\n\nDuke Huan was reading in the hall above. Below, Wheelwright Bian was carving a wheel. Setting aside his mallet and chisel, he ascended and asked the duke, \"May I dare ask what words Your Grace is reading?\"\n\nThe duke replied, \"The words of a sage.\"\n\n\"Is the sage still alive?\"\n\n\"No, he is already dead.\"\n\n\"Then what Your Grace reads are but the dregs of the ancients.\"\n\nDuke Huan said, \"I am reading—how can a wheelwright presume to criticize? If you have an explanation, speak; if not, you shall die.\"\n\nWheelwright Bian said, \"Your servant observes this from his own craft. When carving a wheel, if done too slowly, it is smooth but not firm; if too swiftly, it is rough and does not fit. Neither too slow nor too fast—it is grasped by the hand and responds to the heart. The mouth cannot describe it, yet a certain skill resides in the process. I cannot make my son understand it, nor can my son receive it from me. Thus, at seventy, I am still carving wheels. If the ancients and what they could not transmit have perished, then what Your Grace reads are but the dregs of the ancients.\"\n\n*The Southern Florescence Perfected Scripture, Scroll Three: \"Outer Chapters\" – \"Heaven’s Revolutions\" (Chapter Fourteen)*\nDoes Heaven revolve? Does Earth abide? Do the sun and moon contend for their places?\n\nWho governs these movements? Who upholds their order? Who, without apparent cause, sets them in motion? Is there some hidden mechanism that compels them? Or do they revolve of themselves, unable to cease? Do clouds form rain, or does rain form clouds? Who regulates their rise and fall? Who, without cause, indulges in excess and urges them on? The wind rises from the north, now west, now east, drifting upward in restless motion—who exhales and inhales it? Who, without cause, stirs and scatters it? May I ask the reason?\n\nWu Xian summoned and said: \"Come, let me tell you. Heaven has six poles and five constants; when emperors and kings follow them, there is order, but when they oppose them, there is calamity. The affairs of the Nine Rivers, when governed with perfected virtue, illuminate the earth below, and all under heaven bear them—this is called the Supreme August.\n\nThe Grand Steward Dang of Shang asked Zhuangzi about *ren* (benevolence). Zhuangzi said: \"Tigers and wolves possess *ren*.\" Dang said: \"What do you mean?\" Zhuangzi said: \"Father and son show affection to one another—how is this not *ren*?\" Dang said: \"May I ask about perfect *ren*?\" Zhuangzi said: \"Perfect *ren* has no partiality.\" The Grand Steward said: \"I have heard that without partiality there is no love, and without love there is no filial piety. Can perfect *ren* be unfilial?\" Zhuangzi said: \"Not so. Perfect *ren* is loftier still; filial piety is insufficient to describe it. This is not a statement that opposes filial piety, but one that transcends it. One traveling south to Ying, though facing north, cannot see Mount Ming—why is this? Because it is too distant. Thus it is said: Reverent filial piety is easy; [lacuna] loving filial piety is difficult. Loving filial piety is easy, but forgetting one’s parents is difficult. Forgetting one’s parents is easy, but making one’s parents forget you is difficult. Making one’s parents forget you is easy, but forgetting all under heaven is difficult. Forgetting all under heaven is easy, but making all under heaven forget you is difficult. The virtue of Yao and Shun was abandoned, yet they did not act for its sake; their beneficence spread through ten thousand generations, yet none under heaven knew it—how could it be merely a matter of sighing over *ren* and filial piety? Filial piety, fraternal duty, *ren*, *yi* (righteousness), loyalty, trust, integrity, and incorruptibility—these are all self-exertions that enslave one’s virtue; they are not worthy of praise. Thus it is said: The most noble surpasses state rank; the most wealthy surpasses state wealth; the greatest aspiration surpasses fame and reputation. Therefore, the Dao does not change.\"\n\nBei Men Cheng asked the Yellow Emperor: \"When Your Majesty performed the music of *Xianchi* in the wilds of Dongting, at first I heard it and was afraid; then I heard it and was calmed; finally, I heard it and was bewildered. Vast and silent, I could not find myself.\" The Emperor said: \"You were nearly right to feel so.\"\n\nI performed it through human affairs, harmonized it with Heaven, enacted it with ritual and righteousness, and established it in the Great Purity. The supreme music first responds to human affairs, aligns with Heaven’s principles, proceeds through the Five Virtues, and accords with nature—only then does it regulate the four seasons and bring perfect harmony to the myriad things.\n\nThe four seasons arise in succession, the myriad things follow their birth; now flourishing, now declining, patterned like the alternation of Wen and Wu; now clear, now turbid, yin and yang in balanced harmony, their sounds flowing like radiant light. When hibernating creatures first stir, I startle them with thunder. Its end has no tail, its beginning no head; now dying, now living, now sinking, now rising—ever constant yet never to be awaited. Thus you were afraid.\n\nThen I performed it with the harmony of yin and yang, illuminating it with the brightness of sun and moon. Its sounds could be short or long, soft or hard; transforming uniformly, not bound to fixed forms. In valleys it fills the valleys, in pits it fills the pits; it seals off the spirit, taking things as its measure. Its sounds resound freely, its name lofty and luminous. Thus ghosts and spirits guard their hidden realms, while sun, moon, and stars follow their courses. I halt it at the finite, yet let it flow into the infinite. You wish to ponder it but cannot grasp it, gaze at it but cannot see it, pursue it but cannot reach it. Suddenly you stand on the path of the fourfold void, leaning against a withered catalpa and chanting. Your eyes strain to see what you desire, your strength fails to pursue what you seek—I have already left you behind. When form fills emptiness, it becomes pliable and yielding. You became yielding, and so were calmed.\n\nThen I performed it with the sound of no-sound, attuning it to the mandate of nature. Thus it seemed to blend and surge like tangled growth, a forest of music yet without form; spreading and waving without trailing, dark and obscure yet soundless. Moving without direction, dwelling in profound obscurity—some call it death, some call it life; some call it substance, some call it glory. Flowing and scattering, shifting without fixed sound. The world doubts it, seeking answers from the sages. The sage is one who penetrates to reality and fulfills destiny. The celestial mechanism is not displayed, yet the five senses are all complete—this is called Heaven’s music, which delights the heart without words. Thus the clans of old praised it, saying: \"Exhausted in listening, one hears no sound; gazing, one sees no form. It fills heaven and earth, enveloping the six directions.\" You wish to hear it but find no point of contact—thus you are bewildered.\n\nMusic begins with fear, and fear gives rise to reverence; then I followed it with calm, and complacency leads to escape; finally, it ends in confusion, and confusion gives rise to foolishness. Foolishness leads to the Dao, and the Dao can be borne and journeyed with as one.\n\nConfucius traveled west to Wei. Yan Yuan asked Shi Jin, \"What do you make of our Master’s conduct?\" Shi Jin said, \"Alas! Your Master is truly in dire straits.\" Yan Yuan said, \"Why do you say that?\" Shi Jin replied: \"Before a straw dog is set out for sacrifice, it is placed in a fine basket, wrapped in embroidered cloth, and the invocator fasts and purifies himself to present it. But once it has been set out, passersby trample its head and spine, and fuel-gatherers take it to burn. If one were to gather it up again, place it in a fine basket, wrap it in embroidered cloth, and wander or rest beneath it, one would not dream well and would surely suffer nightmares. Now your Master has taken the already-discarded straw dogs of former teachers, and you disciples wander and rest beneath them. Thus he was hewn down in Song, had his traces erased in Wei, was impoverished in Shang and Zhou—was this not like a nightmare? Besieged between Chen and Cai, seven days without cooked food, life and death as close as neighbors—was this not like a nightmare?\n\nFor traveling on water, nothing is better than a boat; for traveling on land, nothing is better than a cart. To take a boat’s suitability for water and try to push it on land is to spend a lifetime moving no more than a few paces. Are not ancient and modern times like water and land? Are not Zhou and Lu like boat and cart? Now to drag Zhou’s practices into Lu is like pushing a boat on land—laborious and fruitless, and one’s person will surely suffer misfortune. He does not understand the transmission without fixed methods, which responds to things without exhaustion.\n\nMoreover, have you alone not seen the well-sweep? Pull it and it bows; release it and it rises. What pulls it is people, not the sweep pulling people—thus it bows and rises without offending anyone. Therefore, the ritual, righteousness, laws, and institutions of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors were not prized for uniformity but for their efficacy in governance. Thus the ritual, righteousness, laws, and institutions of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors are like the hawthorn, pear, orange, and pomelo—their flavors differ yet all are pleasing to the mouth. Therefore, ritual, righteousness, laws, and institutions are things that change with the times.\n\nNow if you take a macaque and dress it in the Duke of Zhou’s robes, it will surely gnaw and tear them, stripping them off entirely before it is satisfied. To observe the differences between past and present is like the difference between a macaque and the Duke of Zhou. Thus when Xi Shi suffered from heartache and knit her brows in her village, the ugly women of her village saw it and thought it beautiful, so they too clutched their chests and knit their brows in their village. The rich people of the village saw them and firmly shut their doors, refusing to come out; the poor people saw them, took their wives and children, and fled. They knew how to imitate beauty but did not know why Xi Shi’s knitting of brows was beautiful. Alas! Your Master is truly in dire straits.\"\n\nConfucius had reached the age of fifty-one without hearing the Dao, so he went south to Pei to see Lao Dan. Lao Dan said, \"Have you come? I have heard that you are a worthy man of the northern regions—have you attained the Dao?\" Confucius said, \"I have not.\" Lao Dan said, \"How have you sought it?\" Confucius said, \"I sought it in measures and calculations, but after five years I had not attained it.\" Lao Dan said, \"How else have you sought it?\" Confucius said, \"I sought it in yin and yang, but after twelve years I had not attained it.\" Lao Dan said, \"Just so. If the Dao could be offered, there is no one who would not offer it to their lord...\"\n\nIf the Dao could be advanced, there is no one who would not advance it to their parents; if the Dao could be told to others, there is no one who would not tell it to their brothers; if the Dao could be given to others, there is no one who would not give it to their children and grandchildren. Yet it cannot be so—there is no other reason: internally, there is no master to hold it, and externally, there is no standard to carry it forth. What issues from within is not received from without—thus the sage does not emerge; what enters from without finds no master within—thus the sage does not conceal himself.\n\nFame is a public vessel—it cannot be taken in excess. Benevolence and righteousness are the thatched huts of the former sages, where one may lodge for a single night but cannot dwell long, for to observe them is to demand much. The utmost persons of antiquity borrowed the Way of benevolence and lodged in the shelter of righteousness, roaming the wilds of carefree wandering, feeding in the fields of simplicity, and standing in the gardens of non-transaction. Carefree wandering is effortless action; simplicity is ease of nourishment; non-transaction is without expenditure. The ancients called this \"the wandering of gathering authenticity.\"\n\nThose who take wealth as right cannot relinquish emolument; those who take prominence as right cannot relinquish fame.\n\nThose who cling to power cannot share its handle. Grasping it, they tremble; releasing it, they grieve—yet they see nothing clearly, ever driven by what they cannot cease. Such are the people punished by Heaven. Resentment and gratitude, taking and giving, admonition and instruction, life and death—these eight are the instruments of governance, and only those who follow great change without obstruction can wield them. Thus it is said: \"To govern is to rectify.\" If one’s heart does not accept this, the Gate of Heaven remains closed.\n\nConfucius visited Lao Dan and spoke of benevolence and righteousness. Lao Dan said: \"When chaff fills the eyes, the four directions of heaven and earth seem to shift; when mosquitoes and gnats bite the skin, one cannot sleep through the night. Benevolence and righteousness, so intrusive, stir up my heart—no greater disorder exists! You would have the world not lose its simplicity, yet you yourself move with the wind and stand by accumulated virtue. Why then do you act so strenuously, as if carrying a drum in search of a lost child? The swan is not white from daily bathing, nor is the crow black from daily dyeing. The natural black and white of things are not worth debating; the spectacle of fame and reputation is not worth expanding. When the spring dries up, fish gather on dry land, wetting each other with their breath, moistening each other with foam—yet how much better to forget one another in the rivers and lakes!\"\n\nWhen Confucius returned from seeing Lao Dan, he did not speak for three days. His disciples asked: \"Master, when you visited Lao Dan, what advice did you seek to give?\" Confucius said: \"Only now have I seen the dragon! The dragon coalesces into form, scatters into patterns, rides the clouds and qi, and nourishes itself in yin and yang. My mouth gaped open, yet I could not speak—what advice could I give Lao Dan?\"\n\nZigong said: \"Then are there truly people who dwell like corpses yet manifest like dragons, roar like thunder yet remain as silent as the abyss, and act with the power of heaven and earth? Might I observe such a one?\" Thereupon, he went to see Lao Dan on Confucius’s behalf.\n\nLao Dan was sitting in his hall when he responded, softly: \"My years have advanced, and I am passing away. What would you warn me of?\" Zigong said: \"The governance of the Three Kings and Five Emperors differed, yet their legacy of fame was the same. Why then do you alone deem them not sages?\"\n\nLao Dan said: \"Young man, come closer. Why do you say they differed?\" Zigong replied: \"Yao passed the throne to Shun, Shun to Yu, Yu relied on labor while Tang used force, King Wen submitted to Zhou without daring to oppose, and King Wu opposed Zhou without consenting to submit. Thus I say they differed.\"\n\nLao Dan said: \"Young man, come closer. Let me tell you of the governance of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors. The Yellow Emperor governed the world by unifying the people’s hearts, so that when parents died, they did not mourn—and none found fault with this. Yao governed the world by fostering kinship, so that when people killed their kin, none found fault with this. Shun governed the world by inciting competition, so that pregnant women gave birth in ten months, children spoke at five months, and before they could crawl, they began to recognize others—thus people began to die young. Yu governed the world by altering the people’s hearts, so that each had their own intentions, and weapons followed suit. Killing thieves was not considered killing; people acted as their own kind, and the world was left to itself. Thus the world was greatly alarmed, and the Confucians and Mohists arose. Their beginnings had order, yet now—what can one say of women today? I tell you: the governance of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors was called ‘order,’ yet no greater disorder existed. The wisdom of the Three Sovereigns obscured the brightness of the sun and moon above, disrupted the essence of mountains and rivers below, and threw the seasons’ workings into chaos. Their knowledge exceeded the tail of the *qujiang* beast, yet creatures could not secure the natural state of their lives. And they still called themselves sages—is this not shameful? Truly, they knew no shame!\"\n\nZigong stood uneasily, shifting his feet. Confucius said to Lao Dan: \"I have studied the Six Classics—*The Odes*, *The Documents*, *The Rites*, *The Music*, *The Changes*, and *The Spring and Autumn*—and believed myself well-versed in their principles. I have advised seventy-two rulers, expounding the Way of the former kings and clarifying the governance of the Zhou and Shao, yet not a single ruler adopted them. How difficult it is to persuade people, and how hard to illuminate the Dao!\"\n\nLao Dan said: \"Fortunate indeed that you did not encounter a ruler of this age! The Six Classics are the worn tracks of the former kings—how could they be the very governance itself? What you speak of is still but the track. The track is what the shoe leaves behind—how could it be the shoe itself? When white egrets gaze at one another, their pupils do not move, yet they mate; insects, the male singing on the upwind, the female responding from downwind, yet they mate. Each kind has its own male and female, thus they mate. Nature cannot be altered, fate cannot be changed, time cannot be halted, the Dao cannot be blocked. If one attains the Dao, nothing is impossible; if one loses it, nothing is possible.\"\n\nThree months later, Confucius visited Lao Dan again and said: \"I have grasped it! Crows and magpies hatch their young, fish pass foam to one another, the slender-waisted wasp transforms, and the elder brother weeps for his younger sibling. For too long, I have not transformed with others. If I do not transform with others, how can I transform them?\"\n\nLao Dan said: \"Good. You have grasped it.\"\n\n**Chapter Fifteen: Carving Intentions**\nTo carve intentions and uphold conduct, to depart from the world and differ from the common, to engage in lofty discourse and bitter reproach—this is but arrogance. Such are the scholars of mountains and valleys, not the people of this world, favored by those who wither and plunge into the abyss. To speak of benevolence, righteousness, loyalty, and trust, of reverence, frugality, and deference—this is but cultivation. Such are the scholars of a peaceful age, the teachers and instructors, favored by those who wander and dwell in learning. To speak of great achievements, to establish great fame, to order ruler and minister, to rectify high and low—this is but governance.\n\nSuch are the scholars of the court, the men who honor their lords and strengthen their states, favored by those who achieve merit and annex territory.\n\nTo dwell in marshes and wilds, to abide in seclusion and openness, to fish and idle—this is but nonaction. Such are the scholars of rivers and seas, the men who flee the world, favored by those who seek leisure. To practice breath control, to exhale the old and inhale the new, to stretch like a bear and crane—this is but longevity. Such are the practitioners of Dao-yin, the men who nurture the body, favored by those who, like Peng Zu, seek long life.\n\nYet one who does not carve intentions yet rises high, who is not bound by benevolence and righteousness yet cultivates virtue, who seeks no merit or fame yet governs, who does not flee to rivers and seas yet finds leisure, who does not practice Dao-yin yet attains longevity—such a one forgets nothing, yet lacks nothing. Serene and boundless, all beauties follow in their wake. This is the Dao of Heaven and Earth, the virtue of the sage.\n\nThus it is said: tranquility and stillness, emptiness and nonaction—these are the equilibrium of Heaven and Earth, the essence of the Dao and virtue. Thus it is said: when the sage rests in ease, he is level and yielding; being level and yielding, he is tranquil and expansive. Tranquil and expansive, then cares and troubles cannot enter, perverse qi cannot assail. Thus his virtue is whole and his spirit unharmed.\n\nThus it is said: the sage’s life follows the movement of Heaven; his death is the transformation of things. At rest, he shares the virtue of yin; in motion, he moves with the wave of yang. He does not precede fortune, nor initiate misfortune. He responds only when stimulated, moves only when pressed, rises only when compelled. He discards knowledge and precedent, following the principle of Heaven. Thus he suffers no heavenly disasters, no burdens from things, no human reproach, no blame from spirits. His life is like floating; his death, like repose. He neither schemes nor plans ahead. Radiant yet not dazzling, trustworthy yet not bound by expectation. In sleep, he does not dream; awake, he knows no care. His spirit is pure, his soul untiring. Emptiness and tranquility, ease and joy—these accord with Heavenly virtue.\n\nThus it is said: sorrow and joy are the perversions of virtue; delight and anger, the transgressions of the Dao; likes and dislikes, the failures of virtue. Therefore, a heart without sorrow or joy is the perfection of virtue; unchanging unity is the perfection of stillness; nonaction is the perfection of emptiness; noninterference with things is the perfection of indifference; nonresistance is the perfection of purity.\n\nThus it is said: if the body labors without rest, it wears out; if essence is used without cease, it exhausts; exhaustion leads to depletion. Water’s nature is such that if it is unmixed, it is clear; if undisturbed, it is level. If pent up and not flowing, it cannot remain clear—this is the image of Heavenly virtue.\n\nThus it is said: pure and unadulterated, still and unchanging, indifferent and nonactive, moving in accord with Heaven’s course—this is the Way of nurturing the spirit. As for the sword of Gan and Yue, though kept in a casket and never used, it is treasured to the utmost. When the spirit flows unimpeded in all four directions, reaching everywhere without limit, ascending to Heaven above, coiling upon the Earth below, transforming and nourishing the myriad things without leaving a trace—its name is \"unity with the Emperor.\" The Way of purity and simplicity is to guard only the spirit. Guard it without loss, and you become one with the spirit. The essence of this unity penetrates, harmonizing with Heavenly order.\n\nA rustic saying goes: the common man values profit; the incorruptible, fame; the worthy, aspiration; the sage, essence. Thus \"simplicity\" means having nothing mixed with it; \"purity\" means not harming the spirit. One who embodies purity and simplicity is called a \"true person.\"\n\n**Chapter Sixteen: Cultivating Nature**\nTo cultivate nature through custom is to use worldly learning to seek the recovery of one’s original state. To be entangled in desires by custom is to use thought to seek the attainment of clarity—these are called the benighted people.\n\nThe ancients who governed the Dao used tranquility to nurture knowledge. They lived without employing knowledge, which is called using knowledge to nurture tranquility. Knowledge and tranquility nurtured each other, and harmony and principle emerged from their nature. Virtue is harmony; the Dao is principle. Virtue admits all without exclusion—this is benevolence. The Dao orders all without exception—this is righteousness. Righteousness made manifest, things draw near—this is loyalty. Centered, pure, and returning to genuine feeling—this is joy. Trust in conduct, receptivity in bearing, and compliance with pattern—this is ritual. When ritual and music are practiced in a biased manner, the world falls into chaos. If one corrects others while obscuring one’s own virtue, virtue is no longer all-embracing. If it is not all-embracing, things inevitably lose their nature.\n\nIn ancient times, people dwelt in primordial chaos, yet with their age they attained indifference and stillness. In that era, yin and yang were harmonious and calm, ghosts and spirits did not disturb, the four seasons kept their rhythm, the myriad things were unharmed, the multitude of living beings did not die young. Though humans possessed knowledge, they had no use for it—this was called \"perfect unity.\" In that time, none acted, yet all was constantly spontaneous.\n\nWhen virtue declined, Sui Ren and Fu Xi began to govern the world, and thus compliance no longer achieved unity. When virtue declined further, Shen Nong and the Yellow Emperor began to govern the world, and thus peace no longer ensured compliance. When virtue declined still further, Yao and Shun began to govern the world, initiating the currents of governance and transformation. They diluted the rich and scattered the simple, departed from the Dao to pursue goodness, and risked virtue to enact policies. Then they abandoned nature and followed the heart. Hearts recognized one another through knowledge, yet this was insufficient to settle the world. Thus they supplemented it with culture and enriched it with erudition. Culture extinguished substance; erudition drowned the heart. Then the people began to be confused and disordered, unable to return to their nature and recover their original state.\n\nFrom this perspective, the world has lost the Dao, and the Dao has lost the world. World and Dao mutually lose each other—how can the person of the Dao arise in the world, and how can the world arise in the Dao? If the Dao cannot arise in the world, and the world cannot arise in the Dao, then even if the sage does not dwell in the mountains and forests, his virtue is hidden. Hidden, yet not by his own concealment.\n\nThe so-called \"recluses\" of old did not crouch in concealment and refuse to appear, nor did they shut their mouths and refuse to speak, nor hide their knowledge and refuse to express it. The times and fate were greatly awry.\n\nWhen the times and fate align and one’s Way flourishes throughout the world, one returns to unity without seeking nearness. When the times and fate do not align and one’s Way is utterly thwarted in the world, one deeply roots and calmly abides, awaiting the moment—this is the Way of preserving the self. The ancients who conducted themselves did not adorn their knowledge with eloquence, nor did they exhaust the world with their knowledge, nor did they exhaust virtue with their knowledge. Serene in their place, they returned to their nature—what more was there to do?\n\nThe Dao is not meant for petty conduct; virtue is not meant for petty understanding. Petty understanding harms virtue; petty conduct harms the Dao. Thus it is said: rectify the self and nothing more. To delight in wholeness is called \"attaining one’s aspiration.\" The ancients who spoke of attaining aspiration did not mean attaining rank and emolument; they meant that nothing could augment their joy. Those today who speak of attaining aspiration mean attaining rank and emolument. When rank and emolument rest upon the self, they are not of one’s nature and fate—they are the fortuitous arrival of things, a lodging. As a lodging, their coming cannot be enclosed, nor their going halted. Therefore, one does not indulge one’s aspirations for rank and emolument, nor follow convention in poverty and hardship. One’s joy is the same in both, and so one is without sorrow. If one is unhappy when the lodging departs, then even in joy, one has never been free from distraction. Thus it is said: those who lose themselves in things and forfeit their nature to custom are called \"the people of inverted priorities.\"\n\n---\n\n*Chapter Seventeen: \"Autumn Floods\" of the* Nan Hua True Classic\n\nWhen the autumn floods arrive, the hundred streams pour into the Yellow River. The current swells so vast that between its banks and islets, one cannot distinguish ox from horse. Thereupon, the River Lord rejoiced, believing all the world’s beauty to be contained within himself. Following the current eastward, he came to the Northern Sea. Gazing east, he saw no end to the waters. Thereupon, the River Lord turned his face in dismay, looked toward Ruo, and sighed: \"There is a common saying: 'Hearing the Dao a hundred times, one thinks none can compare to oneself.' That describes me. Moreover, I once heard of those who belittled Confucius’s learning and disparaged Boyi’s righteousness, and I did not believe it. Now that I have witnessed the boundlessness of your waters, had I not come to your gate, I would have been in peril—I would long have been ridiculed by those of great understanding.\"\n\nThe Lord of the Northern Sea said: \"A well frog cannot speak of the sea, confined as it is by its pit; a summer insect cannot speak of ice, bound as it is by its season; a narrow scholar cannot speak of the Dao, constrained as he is by his teachings. Now that you have emerged from your banks and observed the great sea, you know your own inadequacy—you may now be spoken with about great principles. Of all the waters under heaven, none is greater than the sea. The ten thousand streams return to it, yet it never fills, though no one knows when it will cease; its tail drains, yet it never empties, though no one knows when it will end. Unchanged by spring or autumn, unmoved by flood or drought, it surpasses the flow of the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers beyond all measure. Yet I have never taken pride in this, for I compare my form to heaven and earth and receive qi from yin and yang. Within heaven and earth, I am but a pebble or a twig in a great mountain. Aware of my own smallness, why should I take pride? Measuring the four seas within heaven and earth, are they not like a molehill in a vast marsh? Measuring the Central States within the seas, are they not like a grain of millet in a granary? The number of things is called ten thousand, yet humans are but one among them. Of all the people gathered in the nine provinces, where grain is grown and boats and carts travel, humans are but one among them. Compared to the ten thousand things, are they not like the tip of a hair on a horse’s body? What the Five Emperors inherited, what the Three Kings contended for, what the humane worry over, what the devoted labor for—all of it is this. Boyi renounced it to gain fame; Confucius discoursed on it to display his erudition—this was their self-aggrandizement. Is it not like your former self-aggrandizement over your waters?\"\n\nThe River Lord said: \"Then may I consider heaven and earth great and the tip of a hair small?\"\n\nThe Lord of the Northern Sea said: \"No. Things have measure without end; time has no cessation; allotment has no constancy; beginning and end have no fixed pattern. Thus, the greatly wise observe both far and near, so that the small is not deemed little, nor the great deemed much. Knowing measure is without end, they verify the old and the new, so that though pressed they are not distressed, though assailed they are not divided. Knowing time has no cessation, they examine fullness and emptiness, so that though they gain they are not joyful, though they lose they are not sorrowful—knowing allotment has no constancy. Understanding the level path, though born they are not delighted, though dead they do not see it as misfortune—knowing beginning and end have no fixed pattern. Calculating what humans know, it is less than what they do not know; the time of their lives is less than the time before they were born. Seeking to exhaust the realm of the utmost great with what is utmost small, they become confused and cannot attain understanding. From this perspective, how can one know the tip of a hair is sufficient to determine the boundary of the utmost small? How can one know heaven and earth are sufficient to exhaust the realm of the utmost great?\"\n\nThe River Lord said: \"Those who discourse in the world all say: 'The utmost refined has no form; the utmost great cannot be encompassed.' Is this truly so?\"\n\nThe Lord of the Northern Sea said: \"From the small, one cannot see the great in its entirety; from the great, one cannot see the small clearly. The refined is the subtlest of the small; the vast is the most abundant of the great...\"\n\nThus, their advantages differ—this is the nature of circumstances. The refined and the coarse are terms applied to what has form; what is formless cannot be divided by calculation; what cannot be encompassed cannot be exhausted by reckoning. What can be discussed in words is the coarse aspect of things; what can be grasped by intention is the refined aspect of things. That which words cannot discuss, and intention cannot fathom, does not fall within the scope of refined or coarse.\n\nTherefore, the conduct of the great person does not extend to harming others, nor does it abound in benevolence and kindness. In action, they do not seek profit, nor do they despise gatekeepers and servants. They do not contend over goods and wealth, nor do they excessively defer; in affairs, they do not rely on others, nor do they overindulge in their own strength, nor do they despise the greedy and corrupt. Their conduct differs from the common, yet they do not excessively avoid eccentricity. They follow the multitude in their actions, yet do not despise flatterers. The world’s ranks and emoluments are insufficient to encourage them; disgrace and punishment are insufficient to shame them. They know that right and wrong cannot be definitively divided, nor can the fine and the vast be clearly demarcated.\n\nIt is said: The Daoist does not strive, the one of utmost virtue does not attain, the great person has no fixed self—this is the utmost in moderation.\n\nThe River Lord said: \"Beyond things, within things—how does one determine nobility and baseness? How does one determine smallness and greatness?\"\n\nThe Lord of the Northern Sea said: \"From the perspective of the Dao, things have no nobility or baseness. From the perspective of things, each values itself and devalues others. From the perspective of custom, nobility and baseness do not reside in oneself. From the perspective of differentiation: if you magnify what is great in something, then nothing is not great; if you diminish what is small in something, then nothing is not small. Knowing that heaven and earth are like a grain of millet, and that the tip of a hair is like a mountain, then the distinctions of measurement become apparent.\n\nFrom the perspective of function: if you affirm what something possesses, then nothing does not possess; if you negate what something lacks, then nothing does not lack. Knowing that east and west are opposites yet cannot be without each other, then the division of function is settled.\n\nFrom the perspective of inclination: if you affirm what something affirms, then nothing is not affirmed; if you negate what something negates, then nothing is not negated. Knowing that Yao and Jie each affirmed their own way and negated the other, then the inclinations of conduct become clear.\n\nIn ancient times, Yao and Shun yielded the throne, yet Zhi and Qiang yielded and perished; Tang and Wu contended and became kings, while the Duke of Bai contended and was destroyed. From this, we see that the rites of contention and yielding, the conduct of Yao and Jie, nobility and baseness have their times—they cannot be taken as constant.\n\nA battering ram can breach a city wall but cannot plug a hole—this speaks of differing implements. The swift horses Qi Ji and Luo Li can gallop a thousand *li* in a day, yet they are not as good as a wildcat at catching mice—this speaks of differing skills. The owl can snatch fleas at night and discern the tip of a hair, yet when it stares with wide eyes, it cannot see a mountain—this speaks of differing natures.\n\nThus, it is said: How can one take this as right and that as wrong, take order as order and chaos as chaos? This is to fail to understand the principles of heaven and earth and the conditions of the myriad things. It is like taking heaven as teacher without earth, taking yin as teacher without yang—its impossibility is clear. Yet if one still speaks of it without ceasing, they are either foolish or deceitful.\n\nThe succession of emperors and kings differs; the inheritance of the Three Dynasties differs. Those who go against their time and defy custom are called usurpers; those who align with their time and follow custom are called righteous followers.\n\nSilent, O River Lord, how do you know the gate of nobility and baseness, the domain of smallness and greatness?\"\n\nThe River Lord said: \"Then what should I do? What should I not do? How should I ultimately manage my acceptance and rejection, my inclinations and aversions?\"\n\nThe Lord of the Northern Sea said: \"From the perspective of the Dao, what is noble? What is base? This is called reversal and overflow—do not constrain your aspirations, for they will greatly diverge from the Dao. What is few? What is many? This is called alternation and exchange—do not act with singularity, for you will be at odds with the Dao.\n\nSolemn as a state with its ruler, yet without private virtue; reverent as a sacrifice with its altar, yet without private blessing; boundless as the four directions without limit, without any restricted domain. Embracing the myriad things, who bears them up? This is called having no fixed direction.\n\nThe myriad things are equal—who is short? Who is long? The Dao has no end or beginning; things have death and life, yet do not rely on their completion. Now empty, now full, they do not abide in their form. Years cannot be lifted, time cannot be halted; ebb and flow, fullness and emptiness—when they end, they begin again. This is how one speaks of the great meaning’s direction, discusses the principles of the myriad things.\n\nThe arising of things is like a gallop, like a swift ride—there is no movement that does not change, no moment that does not shift. What is there to do? What is there not to do? Things will transform of themselves.\"\n\nThe River Lord said: \"Then what is the value of the Dao?\"\n\nThe Lord of the Northern Sea said: \"One who knows the Dao necessarily comprehends principle; one who comprehends principle necessarily understands adaptability; one who understands adaptability does not allow things to harm them. The one of utmost virtue: fire cannot burn them, water cannot drown them, cold and heat cannot harm them, birds and beasts cannot injure them. This does not mean they are careless—it means they discern safety and danger, are serene amid fortune and misfortune, are cautious in approach and retreat, so that nothing can harm them.\n\nThus it is said: Heaven is within, humans are without; virtue resides in heaven. Knowing the conduct of heaven and humans, rooted in heaven, positioned in attainment—contracting and expanding, returning to the essential and speaking of the ultimate.\n\nWhat is called heaven? What is called human?\"\n\nBoreas replied: \"Oxen and horses have four legs—this is called heaven; bridling a horse’s head or piercing an ox’s nose—this is called human. Thus it is said: Do not let the human obliterate heaven, do not let the artificial obliterate fate, do not let attainment be sacrificed for fame. Guard this carefully and do not lose it—this is called returning to one’s true nature.\n\nKui pitied Xuan, Xuan pitied the snake, the snake pitied the wind, the wind pitied the eye, and the eye pitied the heart.\n\nKui said to the jiao: 'I hop and stride on one foot—nothing could be simpler. Yet you employ ten thousand feet—how is this possible?'\nXuan replied: 'Not so. Have you not seen one who spits? When they expel it, the large droplets are like pearls, the small like mist, and the countless falling fragments cannot be numbered. Now you move my heavenly mechanism, yet do not understand how it works.'\n\nXuan said to the snake: 'I walk with many feet yet cannot match you who have none—why is this?'\nThe snake replied: 'How can one alter what the heavenly mechanism moves? What need have I for feet?'\n\nThe snake said to the wind: 'I move my spine and ribs to advance—there is something to it. Yet you rise in a great gust from the Northern Sea and enter the Southern Sea as if nothing were there—why is this?'\nThe wind replied: 'Indeed, I rise in a great gust from the Northern Sea and enter the Southern Sea, yet a finger can overcome me, a foot can trample me. Nevertheless, only I can snap great trees and topple grand houses. Thus, to turn many small defeats into a great victory—only the sage can achieve this.'\n\nConfucius was traveling in Kuang when men of Song surrounded him several layers deep, yet he continued strumming and singing without pause. Zilu entered and said: 'How can you be so joyful, Master?'\nConfucius replied: 'Come, let me tell you. I have long sought to avoid adversity, yet cannot escape it—this is fate. I have long sought success, yet cannot attain it—this is timing. In the age of Yao and Shun, there were no suffering people, not because of wisdom; in the age of Jie and Zhou, there were no successful people, not because of folly. Such is the way of circumstances.\n\nThe fisherman who does not avoid dragons and jiao when traveling by water—this is the courage of his craft. The hunter who does not avoid rhinoceroses and tigers when traveling by land—this is the courage of his craft. The warrior who faces crossed blades and regards death as life—this is the courage of the resolute. To know that adversity has its fate, that success has its time, and to face great peril without fear—this is the courage of the sage. Where do you stand? Be at ease.'\"\n\n\"My fate is constrained by forces beyond me.\n\nSoon after, armored soldiers advanced and declared: 'We mistook you for Yang Hu, hence the siege. Now we see our error—we beg leave to withdraw.'\n\nGongsun Long asked Wei Mou: 'In my youth, I studied the Dao of the former kings; in maturity, I mastered the practice of benevolence and righteousness. I harmonized sameness and difference, separated hardness and whiteness; affirmed the untrue, negated the possible; confounded the wisdom of the hundred schools, exhausted the eloquence of all debaters. I took myself for one of perfect understanding. Yet now I hear Zhuangzi’s words and am utterly confounded. Do I fall short in debate? Or do I simply lack his depth of insight? Now I stand speechless—dare I ask the way forward?'\n\nPrince Mou leaned against his desk, sighed deeply, looked to the heavens, and laughed: 'Have you never heard of the frog in the shallow well? It boasted to the sea turtle: \"How I delight in my life! I leap and bound along the well’s rim, rest in the chinks of its broken walls. When I plunge into the water, it supports my armpits and cradles my chin; when I trample the mud, it swallows my feet and ankles. Look around—tadpoles, crabs, and shrimp—none can match me! Moreover, to command the waters of this entire ravine and revel in the joys of my well—what more could one desire? Why not visit sometime and see for yourself?\"\n\nThe sea turtle had not yet set its left foot inside when its right knee was already stuck. It backed away cautiously and told the frog of the sea: \"A distance of a thousand *li* cannot convey its vastness; a height of a thousand *ren* cannot measure its depth. In the time of Yu, nine years out of ten were floods, yet the waters did not increase; in the time of Tang, seven years out of eight were droughts, yet the shores did not diminish. Unchanged by the passage of moments or ages, unmoved by the ebb and flow of quantity—this is the great joy of the Eastern Sea.\"\n\nAt this, the frog in the shallow well was stunned, bewildered, and lost in self-doubt.\n\nNow, if one’s understanding cannot even grasp the boundaries of right and wrong, yet still seeks to examine Zhuangzi’s words—this is like ordering a flea to carry a mountain or a mosquito larva to race across a river. It is a task one cannot bear. And if one’s knowledge cannot fathom the subtleties of his discourse, yet clings to momentary advantage—is this not the very case of the frog in the shallow well?\n\nMoreover, he roams the Yellow Springs and ascends the Great Void, unbound by south or north, released in all four directions, submerged in the unfathomable. Unrestrained by east or west, he begins in profound obscurity and returns to the Great Thoroughfare. Yet you seek to scrutinize him with narrow inquiry, to probe him with argument—this is truly using a tube to view the sky or a awl to measure the earth. Is it not petty?\n\nGo now. Have you not also heard of the young men of Shouling who went to Handan to learn its way of walking?\"\n\nWithout mastering the state’s skill, they lost even their former gait—all they could do was crawl home on hands and knees. Should you not leave now, you too will forget your old ways and lose your own craft.”\n\nGongsun Long’s mouth gaped open, unable to close; his tongue stiffened, unable to descend. He fled in haste.\n\nZhuangzi was fishing at Pu River when the King of Chu sent two ministers to approach him first, saying, “Our king wishes to burden you with the affairs of the realm.” Zhuangzi held his rod and did not turn, saying, “I have heard that in Chu there is a divine tortoise, dead for three thousand years, which the king keeps wrapped in silk and stored in a shrine. Would this tortoise rather have died to leave its bones venerated, or lived to drag its tail through the mud?” The two ministers replied, “It would rather live and drag its tail through the mud.” Zhuangzi said, “Go then. I too will drag my tail through the mud.”\n\nWhen Huizi was prime minister of Liang, Zhuangzi went to visit him. Someone told Huizi, “Zhuangzi is coming to replace you as minister.” Thereupon Huizi grew alarmed and searched the state for three days and three nights. Zhuangzi went to see him and said, “In the south there is a bird called the *yuanyang*. Do you know it? The *yuanyang* sets out from the South Sea and flies to the North Sea; it perches only on the *wutong* tree, eats only bamboo fruit, and drinks only from sweet springs. Then a kite, having caught a rotten rat, looked up as the *yuanyang* passed and screeched, ‘Hah!’ Now do you mean to screech at me with your state of Liang?”\n\nZhuangzi and Huizi strolled above the bridge at Hao River. Zhuangzi said, “The minnows swim about so freely—is this not joy for the fish?” Huizi said, “You are not a fish. How do you know what brings the fish joy?” Zhuangzi said, “You are not me. How do you know that I do not know what brings the fish joy?” Huizi said, “I am not you, so of course I do not know you. But you are certainly not a fish, so it is entirely clear that you do not know what brings the fish joy.” Zhuangzi said, “Let us return to the beginning. When you asked, ‘How do you know what brings the fish joy?’ you already knew that I knew—you were only asking me. I know it here above the Hao.”\n\n*Southern Florescence Perfected Scripture*, Scroll Three, Outer Chapters, “Perfect Joy” Eighteen\n\nIs there in the world perfect joy, or is there not? Is there a way to preserve life, or is there not? What then should one do, and on what should one rely?\n\nWhere should one flee, and where should one abide?\nWhat should one approach, and what should one forsake?\nWhat should one delight in, and what should one detest?\n\nNow, what the world reveres are wealth, honor, longevity, and goodness;\nwhat it delights in are bodily ease, rich flavors, fine garments, beautiful sights, and harmonious sounds.\nWhat it despises are poverty, lowliness, early death, and misfortune;\nwhat it suffers are a body denied rest, a mouth denied rich flavors, a form denied fine garments, eyes denied beautiful sights, and ears denied harmonious sounds.\nIf these are denied, then great sorrow and fear arise.\nIn their concern for form, how foolish they are!\n\nThe wealthy exhaust themselves with toil, amassing wealth they cannot fully use—\nin their concern for form, how estranged they are!\nThe honored pass their nights and days pondering right and wrong—\nin their concern for form, how distant they are!\n\nWhen a person is born, sorrow is born with them.\nThe long-lived grow weary and resentful, their long sorrow refusing to end—\nwhat bitter suffering!\nIn their concern for form, how far they have strayed!\n\nThe steadfast knight is praised by the world as good,\nyet this is not enough to preserve his life.\nI do not know whether goodness is truly good, or truly not good.\nIf it is good, it is not enough to preserve life;\nif it is not good, it is enough to preserve others.\n\nThus it is said:\nWhen loyal admonitions go unheeded, one retreats and does not contend.\nThus Wu Zixu contended and was destroyed in body,\nyet had he not contended, his name would not have endured.\nIs there truly goodness, or is there not?\n\nNow, what the common world pursues and delights in—\ndo I know whether this delight is truly delight, or truly not delight?\nI observe what the common world delights in:\nthe masses rush together, restless as if they cannot stop,\nand all call it delight.\nYet I find it neither delightful nor not delightful.\nIs there truly delight, or is there not?\n\nI take non-action as true delight,\nyet this is what the common world finds most bitter.\nThus it is said:\nPerfect joy is without joy; perfect praise is without praise.\nThe right and wrong of the world cannot truly be settled.\nNevertheless, non-action can settle right and wrong.\nPerfect joy preserves life—only non-action comes close to this.\nLet me try to speak of it.\n\nHeaven is non-active and so becomes clear;\nEarth is non-active and so becomes tranquil.\nThus, when non-action unites, the myriad things transform.\nVague and indistinct, with no place from which they emerge;\nindistinct and vague, with no form to be seen.\nThe teeming things, each in its place, all grow from non-action.\n\nThus it is said:\nHeaven and Earth are non-active, yet nothing is left undone.\nWho among men can attain non-action?\n\nWhen Zhuangzi’s wife died, Huizi came to offer condolences.\nZhuangzi was squatting with his legs spread, drumming on a basin and singing.\nHuizi said, “To live with someone, raise a child to adulthood, grow old together, and then not weep at their death would be enough—\nyet you drum on a basin and sing. Is this not excessive?”\nZhuangzi said, “Not so.\nWhen she first died, how could I alone not feel sorrow?\nBut I examined her beginning and found she had no life.\nNot only no life, but originally no form;\nnot only no form, but originally no qi.\nAmidst the vague and indistinct, there was a transformation, and qi arose;\nqi transformed and form arose;\nform transformed and life arose.\nNow, there is another transformation, and she has gone to death—\nthis is like the passing of spring, autumn, winter, and summer in the four seasons.\n\nWhen others lie at rest in the great chamber, I would wail loudly and follow in weeping,\nbelieving myself to be unenlightened about fate—so I stopped.”\n\nZhilishu and Huajieshu were observing the mound of Mingbo and the wilds of Kunlun,\nwhere the Yellow Emperor once rested.\nSuddenly, a wen grew on Huajieshu’s left elbow, and he frowned in displeasure.\nZhilishu said, “Do you detest it?”\nHuajieshu said, “No, why would I detest it?\nLife is a temporary borrowing;\nwhat borrows and gives rise to life is but dust and grime.\nDeath and life are like day and night.\nMoreover, you and I observe transformation, and transformation has reached me.\nWhy should I detest it?”\n\nWhen Zhuangzi went to Chu, he saw an empty skull, still intact in form.\nHe tapped it with his horsewhip and asked,\n“Did you, sir, covet life and lose the Dao, and so come to this?\nOr did you suffer the fall of a state, execution by axe, and so come to this?\nOr did you commit some unworthy deed, bringing shame to your parents, wife, and children, and so come to this?\nOr did you suffer the miseries of cold and hunger, and so come to this?\nOr did your years run out, and so come to this?”\n\nHaving finished speaking, he took the skull, placed it under his head, and lay down to sleep.\nIn the middle of the night, the skull appeared to him in a dream and said,\n“Your words resemble those of a sophist.\nAll that you mentioned are the burdens of the living.\nIn death, there are none of these.\nWould you like to hear the truth of death?”\nZhuangzi said, “Yes.”\nThe skull said, “In death, there is no ruler above, no subject below,\nnor the affairs of the four seasons.\nAt ease, one takes heaven and earth as spring and autumn.\nEven the joy of a king facing south cannot surpass it.”\nZhuangzi did not believe him and said,\n“I will have the Controller of Fate restore your form,\ngive you bones, flesh, and skin,\nand return you to your parents, wife, children, neighbors, and acquaintances.\nWould you desire this?”\nThe skull furrowed its brow and sighed deeply, saying,\n“How could I abandon the joy of a king facing south and return to the toils of the human world?”\n\nWhen Yan Hui was about to leave for Qi, Confucius wore a worried expression.\nZigong stepped down from his mat and asked,\n“May I dare to ask why, when Yan Hui is going to Qi, you wear a worried expression?”\nConfucius said, “Excellent is your question.\nLong ago, Guanzi spoke words I greatly admired:\n‘A small sack cannot hold a large thing; a short rope cannot draw from a deep well.’\nSuch is the way of things—\nfate has its completions, and form has its fitting uses.\nThese cannot be diminished or increased.\nI fear that Yan Hui will speak to the Marquis of Qi of the Ways of Yao, Shun, and the Yellow Emperor,\nand further add the words of Suiren and Shennong.\nThe Marquis will seek within himself and find nothing,\nand finding nothing, he will be confused.\nWhen a person is confused, they court death.”\n\nAnd have you alone not heard this tale? Long ago, a seabird alighted on the outskirts of Lu. The Marquis of Lu received it with ceremony and offered it wine in the ancestral temple, performed the *Nine Shao* as music, and prepared the grandest sacrificial feast. Yet the bird only gazed in distress, grieving—it dared not eat a single morsel, dared not drink a single cup, and died after three days.\n\nThis was nourishing the bird with what nourishes oneself, not with what nourishes the bird. To nourish a bird as a bird should be nourished, one ought to let it perch in deep forests, roam over open plains, float upon rivers and lakes, feed on minnows and loaches, follow its flock in flight, and rest where it wills. It cares nothing for human speech—why then all this pomp and fuss?\n\nWhen the music of *Xianchi* and *Nine Shao* is played across the wilds of Dongting, birds hear it and take flight, beasts hear it and flee, fish hear it and dive deep, while men, should they hear it, turn back to gather and listen. Fish live in water, yet men die in it—surely they differ, for their likes and dislikes are not the same.\n\nThus the sages of old did not impose a single standard of ability nor demand uniformity in affairs. Names were confined to reality, and principles were set to fit the circumstance—this is what is called \"orderly attainment and enduring fortune.\"\n\nLiezi was traveling and took a meal by the roadside when he saw a century-old skull. Plucking a clump of mugwort, he pointed to it and said: \"Only you and I know that you have never died, never been born. Are you truly grieved? Am I truly joyful?\"\n\nSeeds possess their latent potential. When they obtain water, they grow robust; when they find the border between water and earth, they become the raiment of dragons. Born upon a mound, they become the mound-crow; if the mound-crow gains dense shade, it becomes crow’s-foot. The root of crow’s-foot becomes the navel-cicada, its leaves become butterflies. Butterflies swiftly transform into insects, born beneath the tortoise’s shell, their form like a cast-off skin, their name *jiurang*. After a thousand days, *jiurang* becomes a bird, called *ganyugu*. The foam of *ganyugu* becomes *simí*, and *simí* becomes *shiyùn*. From *shiyùn* is born *yixia*! From *huangyu* is born *jiuyou*, from *piyin* is born the rotten silkworm cocoon. The sheep’s-tare joins with the uninked bamboo, and from old bamboo is born *qingning*; *qingning* gives birth to *cheng*, *cheng* to the horse, the horse to man—and man, in turn, returns into the mechanism. All things emerge from the mechanism, all things enter into the mechanism.\n\n*The Southern Florescence Sutra*, \"Spring, Part Three\" concludes.\n\n---\n\nThose who grasp the essence of life do not strive for what life cannot achieve; those who grasp the essence of fate do not strive for what knowledge cannot alter. To nourish the body, one must first provide it with things—yet there are cases where things are abundant yet the body remains unnourished. To sustain life, one must first avoid separation from the body—yet there are cases where the body remains intact yet life perishes. Life’s arrival cannot be refused, its departure cannot be halted. Alas! The people of the world believe that nourishing the body is enough to preserve life, yet if nourishing the body is truly insufficient to preserve life, then what in the world is worth doing? Though it may not suffice, it cannot be left undone—such efforts are inescapable. To escape the demands of the body, nothing surpasses fleeing the world. Abandon the world, and one is free of entanglements; free of entanglements, one attains perfect equilibrium; in perfect equilibrium, one exchanges life with that which is other—and in this exchange, one approaches the subtle. Why cling to affairs? Why discard life? Forsake affairs, and the body is not wearied; relinquish life, and the essence is not depleted. When the body is whole and the essence restored, one becomes one with Heaven. Heaven and Earth are the parents of the myriad things: united, they form a body; dispersed, they become a beginning. When form and essence are not depleted, this is called \"the power to shift\"; when essence is refined into yet greater essence, it returns to assist Heaven.\n\nMaster Liezi asked Guan Yin: \"The perfected person walks underwater without obstruction, treads fire without heat, moves above the myriad things without fear. How does one attain this?\" Guan Yin replied: \"This is the preservation of pure qi, not the rank of cunning, skill, or daring. Sit, and I will tell you. All things possessing form, image, sound, or color are merely objects—how can objects be far from one another? Why should one strive to be first? It is but a matter of appearance. Thus, the creation of things halts at the formless and ceases where there is no transformation. One who attains this and exhausts it—how could things constrain them? They dwell within the measure of no excess, conceal themselves in the thread of no origin, roam through the beginning and end of the myriad things, unify their nature, nurture their qi, harmonize their virtue, and thereby commune with the source of things. Such a one’s Heavenly endowment remains whole, their spirit undivided—how could things intrude? The drunkard who falls from a carriage, though moving swiftly, does not die. His bones and joints are the same as others’, yet the harm he suffers differs—his spirit is whole. He does not know he is riding, does not know he has fallen; death and life, terror and dread do not enter his breast. Thus, he meets things without breaking. If one who is whole through wine can be thus, how much more so one who is whole through Heaven? The sage conceals himself in Heaven, and so nothing can harm him. A flexible vine does not snap in the wind; even one with a vengeful heart does not resent a tile blown by the gale—thus the world is in perfect balance. Therefore, there are no wars of aggression, no punishments of slaughter—this is the Way of such things. Do not open the Heavenly in man, but open the Heavenly of Heaven. Opening the Heavenly gives birth to virtue; opening the human gives birth to harm. Do not reject Heaven, do not neglect man—then the people will approach their true nature.\"\n\nConfucius, traveling to Chu, emerged into a forest and saw a hunchbacked old man catching cicadas with a pole, as if picking them up by hand. Confucius said: \"You are skillful! Is there a method to this?\" The man replied: \"I have a method.\"\n\nIn the fifth or sixth month, if I stack two pellets and they do not fall, I lose only a fraction; if I stack three and they do not fall, I lose but one in ten; if I stack five and they do not fall, it is as if the cicadas were already fastened to the pole. My body stands as still as a withered stump; my arms remain poised like the branches of a dead tree. Though heaven and earth are vast, and the myriad things are many, I am aware of nothing but the cicada’s wings. I do not turn aside, nor do I waver—how could I exchange the wings of the cicada for the ten thousand things? Thus I never fail to catch them.\n\nConfucius turned to his disciples and said: \"When the mind is undivided, it becomes one with the spirit—this is what the hunchbacked old man demonstrates.\"\n\nYan Yuan asked Confucius: \"Once I crossed the Shangshen Abyss, where the ferryman handled the boat as if by magic. I asked him, 'Can one learn to steer a boat?' He said, 'Yes. Those skilled in swimming can master it quickly. As for divers, they can handle a boat the first time they see one.' I pressed him, but he would not explain. May I ask what he meant?\"\n\nConfucius replied: \"Those skilled in swimming can master it quickly because they have forgotten the water. As for divers, who can handle a boat the first time they see one—it is because they see the abyss as if it were dry land, and a capsized boat as if it were merely a cart rolling backward. Though a thousand dangers lie before them, none can enter their minds. Wherever they go, they are at ease. One who stakes tiles may play skillfully; one who stakes hooks may grow cautious; one who stakes gold may become flustered. The skill is the same, but when one values the prize, the mind becomes burdened by externals. And when the mind is burdened by externals, the inner self grows clumsy.\"\n\nTian Kaizhi visited Duke Wei of Zhou. The duke said: \"I have heard that Zhu Shen studied the art of life. You have associated with him—what have you learned?\"\n\nTian Kaizhi replied: \"I merely stand guard at the gate with a broom in hand—what could I have learned from the master?\"\n\nThe duke said: \"Do not decline, Master Tian. I wish to hear it.\"\n\nKaizhi said: \"I heard the master say that one who nurtures life well is like a shepherd: he watches those who lag behind and urges them forward with his whip.\"\n\nThe duke asked: \"What does that mean?\"\n\nTian Kaizhi replied: \"In Lu there was a man named Shan Bao, who lived in the mountains, drank from streams, and did not compete with others for profit. Though he lived to seventy, his complexion remained like that of a child. Yet he was unlucky enough to meet a hungry tiger, which killed and ate him. There was also Zhang Yi, who frequented the gates of the wealthy and spared no effort in his pursuits. Though he lived only to forty, he died of internal heat. Bao nurtured his inner self, but the tiger devoured his outer; Yi nurtured his outer self, but illness attacked his inner. These two men both failed to urge on those who lagged behind.\"\n\nConfucius said: \"Do not hide so deeply that you are unseen, nor expose yourself so openly that you are exposed—stand like a withered tree in the center. If you attain these three, your name will surely reach its peak. Those who fear the road may kill one in ten travelers, so fathers and sons, brothers and kin warn one another, and none dare venture out without a large escort—is this not wisdom? Yet what people truly fear are the mats they sit on and the food they eat. Not knowing to guard against these is the real mistake.\"\n\nA sacrificial official, dressed in dark robes, approached the pen of pigs and said to one: \"Why do you hate death? I will fatten you for three months, purify you for ten days, fast for three, spread white rushes beneath you, and place your shoulder and haunch upon the carved sacrificial platter—will you agree to this?\" Speaking for the pig, he said: \"Better to live on husks and糟 in the pen than to face such a fate.\" But speaking for himself, he said: \"Yet if I could live with the honor of a high minister and die with my body laid upon fine mats and coffins, I would choose that.\" What differs between the pig’s choice and his own?\n\nDuke Huan was hunting in the marshes with Guan Zhong driving his chariot when he saw a ghost. The duke grasped Guan Zhong’s hand and said: \"What did you see, Uncle Zhong?\"\n\nGuan Zhong replied: \"I saw nothing.\"\n\nOn their return, the duke fell ill and did not emerge for days. A Qi scholar named Li Ziao told him: \"It is you who have harmed yourself—the ghost could not harm you. When the qi of anger and grief scatters and does not return, it causes deficiency. When it rises but does not descend, it makes one prone to rage; when it descends but does not rise, it makes one prone to forgetfulness. If it neither rises nor descends but lodges in the center of the body, at the heart, it causes illness.\"\n\nDuke Huan asked: \"Then are there ghosts?\"\n\nHe replied: \"There are. In the marshes dwell the *lü*; in the waters, the *ao* with its topknot.\"\n\nWithin the confines of a household’s inner walls, even the clamor of thunder dwells. In the northeast’s lower reaches, the *bei’e* and *guilong* leap; in the northwest’s lower reaches, the *zhiyang* resides. Waters harbor the *wangxiang*, mounds the *xing*, mountains the *kui*, wilds the *fanghuang*, and marshes the *weiyi*.\n\nThe duke asked: \"What is the form of the *weiyi* like?\"\n\nPrince Huangzi replied: \"The *weiyi* is as large as a wheel hub, as long as a chariot shaft, clad in purple robes with a crimson crown. As a creature, it abhors the sound of thunderous chariots—when it hears them, it clutches its head and stands upright. To see it is nearly a sign of hegemony.\"\n\nDuke Huan burst into joyful laughter: \"This is what *I* saw!\" Thereupon, he straightened his robes and cap, sat with the prince, and before the day was out, he was unaware that his illness had departed.\n\nJi Yuzi raised fighting cocks for the king. After ten days, the king asked: \"Are the cocks ready?\"\n\n\"Not yet,\" he replied. \"They are still hollow and reliant on their qi.\"\n\nAfter another ten days, the king asked again. \"Not yet,\" he said. \"They still react to shadows.\"\n\nAfter another ten days, the king asked once more. \"Not yet,\" he replied. \"They still glare fiercely and bristle with qi.\"\n\nAfter yet another ten days, the king asked again. \"Almost there,\" he said. \"Though other cocks may crow, they show no change. Gazing at them, they seem like wooden cocks—their virtue is complete. No other cock dares respond; they turn and flee.\"\n\nConfucius observed the Lüliang Falls, where the water plunged thirty *ren* and its froth stretched forty *li*, a place where even the *aoyu* and *aoman* could not swim. He saw a man swimming there and, assuming he was in distress and wished to die, sent his disciples along the current to rescue him. After several hundred paces, the man emerged, his hair unbound, singing as he strolled beneath the embankment.\n\nConfucius followed and questioned him: \"I took you for a ghost, but seeing you, you are a man. May I ask—is there a Dao for treading water?\"\n\n\"No,\" he replied. \"I have no Dao. I began with habit, grew with nature, and completed it with fate. I enter with the current and emerge with the flow, following the water’s Way without imposing my will. This is how I tread it.\"\n\nConfucius asked: \"What do you mean by beginning with habit, growing with nature, and completing with fate?\"\n\nHe replied: \"I was born on the hills and at ease on the hills—this is habit. I grew up in the water and am at ease in the water—this is nature. I do not know why I am thus, yet I am thus—this is fate.\"\n\nZiqing of Lu carved wood into a *ju* stand. When it was finished, those who saw it marveled as if it were the work of ghosts or spirits. The Lord of Lu saw it and asked: \"What technique did you use to make this?\"\n\nHe replied: \"I am but a craftsman—what technique could I possess? Nevertheless, there is one thing. When I set out to make the *ju*, I never dared to waste my qi but always fasted to still my mind. After three days of fasting, I no longer dared to think of rewards, ranks, or emoluments. After five days, I no longer dared to think of praise or blame, skill or clumsiness. After seven days, I suddenly forgot I had limbs or a body. At that time, was there any court? My skill became concentrated, and external distractions dissolved. Only then did I enter the mountain forest to observe the natural qualities of the wood. When the perfect form appeared before me, I set to work—otherwise, I would stop. Thus, I matched heaven with heaven. Is this not why the vessel seems divine?\"\n\nYe Ji demonstrated his charioteering before Duke Zhuang. His advances and retreats aligned with the plumb line, his left and right turns followed the compass. The duke thought even Wen could not surpass him and sent him to drive a hundred circuits before returning.\n\nYan Yu encountered him and, upon entering, said: \"Ji’s horses are about to fail.\"\n\nThe duke remained silent and did not respond. Soon after, the chariot indeed failed and returned.\n\nThe duke asked: \"How did you know?\"\n\nHe replied: \"His horses’ strength was exhausted, yet he still demanded more—hence I said they would fail.\"\n\nA craftsman’s hammer and chisel follow the compass and square, his fingers transform with the material without mental calculation. Thus, his spirit-terrace is unified and unobstructed. Forget the feet, and the shoes fit; forget the waist, and the belt fits; forget right and wrong, and the mind is at ease. Without inner change or outer compliance, one meets events with perfect accord. To begin with ease and never be without it is to forget the ease of ease.\n\nThere was a man named Sun Xiu who, arriving at Bian Qingzi’s door, lamented: \"In my village, I am not called unrefined; in times of peril, I am not called cowardly. Yet when I till the fields, I do not meet with good years; when I serve a lord, I do not meet with a favorable era. I am shunned by my village, driven from my district—what sin have I committed against heaven? Why must I suffer this fate?\"\n\nBianzi replied: \"Have you never heard of the Perfect Man’s conduct? He forgets his liver and gall, disregards his ears and eyes, wandering in a daze beyond the dust and grime, carefree in the realm of no affairs. This is called acting without reliance, growing without domination. Now you adorn your knowledge to startle the foolish, cultivate your person to expose others’ flaws, shining brightly as if carrying the sun and moon in your stride. You have preserved your body intact, complete with nine orifices, and have not halfway become deaf, blind, lame, or crippled to be counted among the masses. You are fortunate indeed—why do you have leisure to resent heaven? Be on your way.\"\n\nSunzi left, and Bianzi entered. As he sat, someone asked a question, and he looked up to the sky and sighed. A disciple inquired, \"Master, why do you sigh?\"\n\nBianzi replied, \"Just now, when Rest came, I spoke to him of the Perfect Man’s virtue. I fear he was startled and may fall into confusion.\"\n\nThe disciple said, \"Not so. If Sunzi’s words were right, then yours were wrong—yet wrong cannot confuse right. If Sunzi’s words were wrong, then yours were right—yet he came already confused. What fault is there in that?\"\n\nBianzi said, \"Not so. Long ago, a bird alighted on the outskirts of Lu. The Lord of Lu delighted in it and prepared a grand feast to entertain it, playing the *Nine Shao* to amuse it. The bird grew anxious, sorrowful, and dizzy, daring neither to eat nor drink. This is called nourishing a bird with what nourishes oneself. As for nourishing a bird with what nourishes a bird, one should let it roost in deep forests, drift upon rivers and lakes, and feed on creeping vines—then it would be at ease on level ground. Now, Rest is a man of simple sincerity and little learning. When I spoke to him of the Perfect Man’s virtue, it was like carrying a palace hall in a carriage and horses, or playing metal chimes with bells and drums. How could he not be startled?\"\n\n---\n\n**The Southern Florescence Perfect Scripture, Scroll Four: \"Outer Chapters – Mountain Trees, Chapter Twenty\"**\n\nZhuangzi was walking in the mountains when he saw a great tree with luxuriant branches and leaves. A woodcutter stood beside it but did not fell it. Asking the reason, Zhuangzi was told, \"It is of no use.\"\n\nZhuangzi said, \"This tree, by being useless, has attained the full span of its natural years.\"\n\nLeaving the mountains, Zhuangzi lodged at the home of an old friend. The friend, pleased, ordered a servant to kill a goose and cook it. The servant asked, \"One can cackle, the other cannot—which should we kill?\"\n\nThe host said, \"Kill the one that cannot cackle.\"\n\nThe next day, a disciple asked Zhuangzi, \"Yesterday, the tree in the mountains, by being useless, attained the full span of its natural years. Now, the master’s goose, by being useless, has died. Where will you, Master, take your stand?\"\n\nZhuangzi laughed and said, \"I will take my stand between usefulness and uselessness. Between usefulness and uselessness—it seems so, yet it is not, and thus one is not yet free from entanglement. But if one rides the Dao and floats upon virtue, it is otherwise: neither praised nor blamed, now a dragon, now a snake, transforming with the times without clinging to any one form; rising and falling, taking harmony as the measure, drifting upon the ancestor of the ten thousand things, treating things as things yet not being treated as a thing by them—how then could one be entangled? This is the method of Shennong and the Yellow Emperor.\n\n\"As for the nature of the ten thousand things and the transmission of human relations, it is not so. Union leads to separation, completion to destruction; sharpness is blunted, honor invites criticism, action incurs loss, worth invites schemes, worthlessness invites deceit. How can one be certain of anything? How lamentable!\n\n\"Take heed, disciples—only in the realm of Dao and virtue is there refuge.\"\n\n---\n\nMishan Yiliao called upon the Lord of Lu, who wore a troubled expression. Mishan said, \"My lord, why do you look troubled?\"\n\nThe Lord of Lu replied, \"I have studied the Way of the former kings and cultivated the undertakings of my predecessors. I honor the spirits and revere the worthy, practicing these with devotion, never resting for a moment—yet I cannot escape misfortune. This is why I am troubled.\"\n\nMishan said, \"My lord’s means of avoiding misfortune are too shallow. The sleek fox and the patterned leopard dwell in mountain forests, crouch in rocky caves, and remain still; they move by night and rest by day, ever vigilant. Though hungry and thirsty, in straitened circumstances, they still roam the rivers and lakes in search of food, ever composed. Yet they cannot escape the calamity of nets and traps. What crime have they committed? Their pelts bring disaster upon them. Is not the state of Lu your pelt?\n\n\"I wish for you, my lord, to strip away your form and discard your pelt, cleanse your heart and rid yourself of desires, and wander in the wilds where no man dwells. In the southern lands, there is a city called the Land of Establishing Virtue. Its people are simple and unadorned, with few selfish desires. They know how to work but not to hoard, give without seeking repayment...\"\n\nThe people know not where righteousness leads, nor whither propriety tends; they act recklessly and wander at will, yet tread the great square. Their life may be joyous, their death may be buried. I wish you, my lord, to abandon your state and cast off custom, to walk in mutual support with the Dao.\n\nThe lord said: \"That Way is distant and perilous, with rivers and mountains in between. I have no boat or carriage—what then?\"\n\nMaster Shinan replied: \"Be not rigid in form, nor linger in place, and this shall be your carriage.\"\n\nThe lord said: \"That Way is secluded and remote, with no one there. With whom shall I be neighbor? I have no provisions, no food—how can I reach it?\"\n\nMaster Shinan said: \"Lessen your lord’s expenditures, diminish your lord’s desires, and though you have no grain, you shall yet be sufficient. Cross the river and float upon the sea; gaze upon it and see no shore, advance ever further and know not where it ends. Those who see you off shall turn back from the shore, and you shall be far from them henceforth. Thus, he who possesses others is encumbered; he who is seen to possess by others is troubled. Therefore, Yao neither possessed others nor was seen to possess by others. I wish to rid you of encumbrance, to remove your troubles, and to wander alone with the Dao in the boundless land.\n\nWhen a double-hulled boat crosses the river, an empty skiff drifts into it. Even a man of narrow mind would not grow angry. But if there were a man aboard, one would shout to him to open or close—once called and unheard, twice called and unheard, then a third call would surely be followed by harsh words. Before, he was not angry, but now he is; before, it was empty, but now it is full. If one can empty oneself and wander through the world, who could harm him?\n\nBeigong She levied taxes for Duke Ling of Wei to cast bells. He built an altar outside the outer gate, and in three months, the bells were hung below the earthen platform. Prince Qingji saw and asked, \"What method did you employ?\"\n\nShe said: \"In the moment of unity, I dared not impose any method. I have heard that once carved and polished, one returns to simplicity. Pity those without understanding, doubt those who hesitate. Gathered in boundless vastness, one sends off the departing and welcomes the arriving. Let those who come not be forbidden, let those who go not be stopped. Follow their strength and bend, adapt to their crookedness, and let them exhaust themselves. Thus, morning and evening, the levies were collected without so much as a hair being harmed—how much more so for those on the great thoroughfare?\"\n\nConfucius was besieged between Chen and Cai, going seven days without cooked food. Taigong Ren went to condole with him, saying: \"You nearly died, did you not?\"\n\nConfucius said: \"Yes.\"\n\n\"Do you hate death?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nRen said: \"Have you not spoken of the way of not dying? In the Eastern Sea there is a bird called *Yidai*. As a bird, it is scattered and disorderly, seemingly incapable. It flies only when led, perches only when pressed, advances not daring to be first, retreats not daring to be last. It does not dare to eat first but must take the leavings. Thus, it is not expelled from the flock, and others cannot harm it, so it escapes misfortune. Straight trees are felled first, sweet wells are drained first. You, I fear, adorn your knowledge to startle the foolish, cultivate yourself to expose the impure, and shine forth as if carrying the sun and moon in your march—how could you escape?\"\n\nLong ago, I heard from a man of great completion: 'He who boasts of himself achieves no merit; he who achieves merit is envied; he who achieves fame is diminished. Who can relinquish merit and fame and return to the common people? The Dao flows but does not dwell in glory; it acts but does not claim a place. Pure and constant, it is nearly mad. Shave off edges, discard influence, and do not seek merit or fame. Thus, one bears no blame from others, and others bear none from him. The perfected man is unknown—why do you delight in this?'\n\nConfucius said: \"Well said!\" He took leave of his acquaintances, sent away his disciples, and fled to the great marsh. He wore a robe of coarse cloth and ate acorns and chestnuts. Entering among beasts, he did not disturb their herds; entering among birds, he did not disrupt their flocks. Birds and beasts did not hate him—how much less men?\n\nConfucius asked Zisang Hu: \"I was twice banished from Lu, had a tree felled upon me in Song, was made a fugitive in Wei, was destitute between Shang and Zhou, and besieged between Chen and Cai. I have suffered these many misfortunes, my close associates have grown more distant, and my disciples and friends have scattered—why is this?\"\n\nZisang Hu said: \"Have you not heard of the flight of the man of Jia? Lin Hui abandoned a jade disc worth a thousand gold pieces and carried a baby on his back as he fled. Someone asked: 'Was it for the money? The baby’s value in coin is little. Was it for the burden? The baby’s burden is great. Why abandon a jade disc worth a thousand gold pieces and carry a baby on your back?' Lin Hui said: 'That was bound by profit; this is bound by Heaven. Those bound by profit abandon one another in straitened circumstances, disaster, and harm. Those bound by Heaven gather together in straitened circumstances, disaster, and harm. The difference between gathering and abandoning is vast. Moreover, the friendship of the noble is as bland as water; the friendship of the petty is as sweet as wine. The noble are bland yet intimate; the petty are sweet yet estranged. Those who come together without cause will part without cause.'\n\nConfucius said: \"I respectfully receive your instruction.\" He walked slowly and leisurely on his return, abandoned his studies, and discarded his books. His disciples no longer bowed before him, yet their affection grew deeper.\n\nAnother day, Zisang Hu said: \"When Shun was about to die, he sincerely warned Yu: 'Beware! In form, nothing is better than following; in feeling, nothing is better than sincerity. Following, one does not stray; sincere, one does not toil. Not straying, not toiling, one does not seek ornament to adorn form. Not seeking ornament to adorn form, one certainly does not depend on things.'\"\n\nZhuangzi wore a patched robe of coarse cloth, fastened his shoes with hemp, and passed by the King of Wei. The king said: \"Why is the master so weary?\"\n\nZhuangzi said: \"It is poverty, not weariness. A scholar with the Dao and virtue who cannot practice them is weary. Wearing tattered clothes and threadbare shoes is poverty, not weariness. This is what is called not encountering the times. Have you alone not seen the leaping monkeys?\"\n\nWhen the gibbon obtains towering catalpa or camphor trees, it grasps the vines and swings through their branches, reigning supreme in its domain—even Yi or Feng Meng could not challenge its mastery. Yet when it finds itself among brambles, thorns, and tangled roots, it moves with caution, glancing sideways, trembling and quaking. Not that its sinews and bones have suddenly stiffened or lost their suppleness, but the terrain is unfavorable, insufficient for it to display its full ability.\n\nNow, to dwell amid benighted rulers and chaotic ministers and yet hope to avoid weariness—how could this be possible? This is like the fate of Bi Gan, whose heart was carved out as proof.\n\nConfucius was stranded between Chen and Cai, going seven days without cooked food. Leaning left against a withered tree, striking its dry branches with his right hand, he sang the airs of the House of Shen. The instruments were present, but the measures were not; the sounds were there, but the modes of gong and jue were absent. Yet the resonance of wood and voice plowed deep, striking true in the hearts of men. Yan Hui stood with hands folded, turning his gaze to observe.\n\nFearing that Hui might expand his own concerns into grand ambitions or turn self-love into sorrow, Confucius said: \"Hui, to bear the decrements of Heaven is easy; to bear the benefits of men is hard. There is no beginning that is not an end—man and Heaven are one. Who, then, is the singer of this song today?\"\n\nYan Hui replied: \"May I ask why bearing the decrements of Heaven is easy?\"\n\nConfucius said: \"Hunger and thirst, cold and heat, the blockage of one’s path—these are the workings of Heaven and Earth, the outpourings of the movement of things. To speak of going along with them is to say one moves in tandem with them. As a minister, one does not dare to abandon this way. If even the way of serving as a minister is thus, how much more so the way of awaiting Heaven’s decree?\"\n\n\"What, then, is meant by bearing the benefits of men being hard?\"\n\nConfucius said: \"At the outset, one’s path opens in four directions, ranks and emoluments arrive without end, and all that benefits things is not one’s own—my fate lies beyond me. The noble man does not steal; the worthy man does not pilfer. If I were to take such things, what would I be? Thus it is said: No bird is wiser than the magpie. Where its eyes ought not to linger, it does not even glance. Though the fruit falls before it, it abandons it and flees. It fears men and yet nests among them—merely to preserve its nest and young. What is meant by ‘no beginning that is not an end’?\"\n\nConfucius said: \"When the myriad things transform and one does not know who succeeds them, how can one know their end? How can one know their beginning? Simply align oneself and await it, that is all.\"\n\nWhat is meant by \"man and Heaven as one\"?\n\nConfucius said: \"There is man—this is Heaven; there is Heaven—this too is Heaven. That man cannot be Heaven is his nature. The sage rests in this and drifts to his end.\"\n\nZhuang Zhou was wandering within the enclosure of Carved Mound when he saw an unusual magpie coming from the south. Its wings spanned seven feet, its eyes measured an inch across. It brushed against Zhou’s forehead and alighted in the chestnut grove. Zhuang Zhou said: \"What bird is this? Its wings are vast yet it does not fly, its eyes are large yet it does not see.\" He hitched up his robe, strode forward, took up his sling, and waited. He saw a cicada, having just found a fine shade, forget its own body; a mantis, seizing the opportunity, raised its forelegs to strike it, seeing only its gain and forgetting its form; the strange magpie, drawn by this, saw only the advantage and forgot its true nature. Zhuang Zhou shuddered and said: \"Ah! Things indeed entangle one another—two kinds summon each other.\" He cast aside his sling and turned to flee, but the warden of the grove pursued and berated him. Zhuang Zhou returned home and for three months did not appear in the courtyard.\n\nLan Ju followed and asked him: \"Master, what has been the matter? For some time now, you have not come to the courtyard.\"\n\nZhuang Zhou said: \"I guarded my form and forgot my body. I gazed upon muddy water and was lost in the clear abyss. Moreover, I have heard from my master: 'Enter their customs, follow their customs.' Today, I wandered in Carved Mound and forgot my body; the strange magpie struck my forehead. I roamed in the chestnut grove and forgot my true nature; the warden of the grove took me for a thief. That is why I have not come to the courtyard.\"\n\nYangzi traveled to Song and lodged at an inn. The innkeeper had two concubines—one beautiful, the other ugly. The ugly one was honored, the beautiful one despised. Yangzi asked the reason, and the innkeeper’s servant replied: \"The beautiful one is beautiful in her own eyes, but I do not see her beauty. The ugly one is ugly in her own eyes, but I do not see her ugliness.\"\n\nYangzi said: \"Disciples, take note: act worthily and abandon the conduct of self-regard. Wherever you go, will you not be loved?\"\n\n---\n\n*Southern Florescence Perfected Scripture*, Scroll Four, Outer Chapters: \"Tian Zifang,\" Twenty-First\n\nTian Zifang was in attendance, sitting beside the Lord of Wei. He repeatedly praised Xi Gong. The Lord said: \"Is Xi Gong your teacher?\"\n\nZifang said: \"No. He is a man of my village. He speaks of the Dao often and aptly, so I praise him.\"\n\nThe Lord said: \"Then do you have no teacher?\"\n\nZifang said: \"I do.\"\n\nThe Lord said: \"Who is your teacher?\"\n\nZifang said: \"Shu Guo Shunzi.\"\n\nThe Lord said: \"Then why have you never spoken of him?\"\n\nZifang said: \"His person is true: his human form holds Heaven’s emptiness, he is pure and preserves the real, clear yet accommodating of things. When things lack the Dao, he rectifies his bearing to awaken them, dissolving their intentions. How could I be worthy to praise him?\"\n\nZifang departed. The Lord sat in a daze for the rest of the day without speaking. He summoned his ministers who stood before him and said: \"How distant is the gentleman of perfect virtue! At first, I took the words of sagely wisdom and the conduct of benevolence and righteousness to be the ultimate. But now that I have heard of Zifang’s teacher, my form is unstrung and I do not wish to move, my mouth is sealed and I do not wish to speak. What I have learned is but a clay figurine—Wei has truly been a burden to me.\"\n\n---\n\nWen Bo Xuezi traveled to Qi and stayed in Lu. A man of Lu requested to see him. Wen Bo Xuezi said: \"No. I have heard that the gentlemen of the Central States are enlightened in ritual and righteousness but coarse in understanding the human heart. I do not wish to see them.\"\n\nWhen he returned to Qi and stayed again in Lu, the same man requested to see him. Wen Bo Xuezi said: \"Before, he sought to see me; now, he seeks to see me again. He must have something to stir me.\" He went out to meet the guest, then returned and sighed. The next day, he met the guest again and returned, sighing once more.\n\nHis servant said: \"Each time you meet this guest, you return and sigh. Why?\"\n\nHe said: \"I have already told you: the people of the Central States are enlightened in ritual and righteousness but coarse in understanding the human heart. The one who saw me before advanced and retreated as if bound by compass and square, conducted himself as if a dragon or a tiger. He admonished me like a son, guided me like a father. That is why I sighed.\"\n\nConfucius saw him and did not speak. Zilu said: \"You have long wished to see Wen Bo Xuezi. Now that you have seen him, why do you not speak?\"\n\nConfucius said: \"With such a man, the Dao is present the moment one’s eyes meet. There is no room for words.\"\n\n---\n\nYan Yuan asked Confucius: \"When you walk, I walk; when you hasten, I hasten; when you run, I run. But when you race ahead, leaving all dust behind, I can only stare blankly from behind.\"\n\nConfucius said: \"Hui, what do you mean?\"\n\nYan Yuan said: \"When you walk, I walk; when you speak, I speak; when you hasten, I hasten; when you debate, I debate; when you run, I run; when you speak of the Dao, I speak of the Dao. Yet when you race ahead, leaving all dust behind, and I can only stare blankly from behind—you do not speak yet are trusted, do not compare yet are all-encompassing, have no vessel yet the people tread before you, and I do not know why.\"\n\nConfucius said: \"Alas! How can this not be examined? There is no greater sorrow than the death of the heart, and the death of the person is secondary to it. The sun rises in the east and sets in the west. All things align with it: those with eyes and feet depend on it to succeed. When it rises, they exist; when it sets, they perish. All things are thus: some depend on it to die, some depend on it to live. Once I received my completed form, I did not transform but awaited its end, moving in accord with things, day and night without pause, yet not knowing where it would lead—so naturally my form was completed. Knowing fate, I cannot plan for what lies ahead. I have followed you all my life, grasped your arm for an instant, and lost it—how can this not be sorrowful?\"\n\nYou are likely clinging to what I cling to. That has already vanished, yet you seek it as if it still exists—this is like seeking a horse in an empty market. I have so thoroughly forgotten you that you have become nothing to me, and you have so thoroughly forgotten me that I have become nothing to you. Yet why should you grieve? Though you may forget the old me, there remains something in me that cannot be forgotten.\n\nConfucius visited Lao Dan, who had just washed his hair and was letting it dry, unbound. He stood there so still he seemed not human. Confucius withdrew and waited. After a while, he approached and said: \"Did my eyes deceive me, or was it truly so? Just now, Master, your form was withered like a dead tree, as if you had abandoned all things and stood apart from humanity.\"\n\nLao Dan said: \"I was letting my mind wander in the origin of things.\"\n\nConfucius asked: \"What do you mean?\"\n\nLao Dan replied: \"The heart is confounded and cannot know; the mouth is shut and cannot speak. Let me try to describe it for you. The utmost yin is solemn and still; the utmost yang is blazing and bright. Solemn stillness arises from heaven; blazing brightness issues from earth. The two intermingle and harmonize, and things are born. Some pattern governs this, yet no form is seen. They wax and wane, fill and empty, now dark, now bright, changing day by day, month by month, acting without cease, yet no trace of their work is seen. Life has its source from which it sprouts; death has its place to which it returns. Beginning and end revolve without end, yet none know where it will cease. If not this, then what else could be their origin?\"\n\nConfucius said: \"May I ask about wandering in this?\"\n\nLao Dan said: \"To attain this is the utmost beauty and joy. To attain the utmost beauty and wander in the utmost joy—this is called the Perfected Person.\"\n\nConfucius said: \"I would like to hear the method.\"\n\nLao Dan said: \"Herbivorous beasts do not fret over changing marshes; aquatic creatures do not fret over changing waters. They undergo few changes yet do not lose their great constancy. Joy and anger, sorrow and happiness do not enter the breast. The world is where the myriad things are one. If you attain this oneness and become the same as it, then your four limbs and hundred parts will be but dust and dirt, and death and life, end and beginning will be like day and night—nothing can disturb them, much less the distinctions of gain and loss, fortune and misfortune. Those who cast off such concerns are like those who discard mud and mire, knowing the body is more precious than such things. What is precious resides in me and is not lost in change. Moreover, the myriad transformations have never had an end—what could trouble the heart? Those who have become one with the Dao are freed from this.\"\n\nConfucius said: \"Master, your virtue matches heaven and earth, yet you still borrow the most profound words to cultivate your heart. Among the noble men of old, who could escape this?\"\n\nLao Dan said: \"Not so. Water, when clear, requires no effort to be naturally so. The Perfected Person, in regard to virtue, does not cultivate it, yet things cannot depart from it—just as heaven is naturally high, earth is naturally thick, and the sun and moon are naturally bright. What cultivation is needed?\"\n\nConfucius left and told Yan Hui: \"In regard to the Dao, I am like a gnat in vinegar. Were it not for the Master lifting the cover from my eyes, I would not have known the great completeness of heaven and earth.\"\n\nZhuangzi visited Duke Ai of Lu. The Duke said: \"There are many Confucians in Lu, but few who follow your methods.\"\n\nZhuangzi said: \"There are few Confucians in Lu.\"\n\nThe Duke said: \"The whole state of Lu wears Confucian robes—how can you say there are few?\"\n\nZhuangzi said: \"I have heard that Confucians who wear round caps know the seasons of heaven; those who wear square shoes know the forms of earth; and those who wear sashes with pendants decide matters as they arise. A noble man who possesses the Dao may not necessarily wear such attire, and those who wear such attire may not necessarily know the Dao.\"\n\nDuke Ai stubbornly disagreed. \"Why not issue a decree throughout the state: 'Those who possess not the Dao yet don this attire shall be put to death'?\" For five days, the Duke proclaimed this decree, and no one in Lu dared wear Confucian robes—save for one man who stood at the palace gate in full Confucian garb.\n\nThe Duke summoned him and questioned him on state affairs. Though the questions twisted and turned a thousand ways, his answers never faltered.\n\nZhuangzi said: \"With all of Lu, there is but one true Confucian. Can this be called many?\"\n\nBaili Xi cared nothing for rank or salary, so when he fed cattle, the cattle grew fat. This made Duke Mu of Qin forget his lowly status and entrust him with governance. The Lords of Yu cared nothing for life or death, and thus could move others.\n\nThe Lord of Song Yuan was about to commission paintings. All the court scribes arrived, bowed in reception, and stood in attendance. Half had already begun licking their brushes and mixing ink when one scribe arrived late. Unhurried, he did not rush forward; having bowed, he did not stand stiffly but went straight to his quarters. The Lord sent someone to observe him and found him sitting with his robes undone, legs sprawled in ease.\n\nThe Lord said: \"This is the true painter.\"\n\nKing Wen was observing at Zang when he saw an old man fishing. Yet his fishing was no fishing—he did not hold the rod as one who fishes, but fished as one always does. King Wen wished to raise him to office and entrust him with governance, but feared his great ministers and elders would not accept it. Yet to abandon the idea and leave him be would be to bear the weight of the people’s suffering without a lord’s protection.\n\nAt dawn, he gathered his ministers and said: \"Last night, I dreamed of a worthy man—dark-complexioned and bearded, riding a dappled horse with one red hoof. He commanded: 'Entrust your governance to the old man of Zang, and perhaps the people will find relief.'\"\n\nThe ministers, startled, said: \"This was your late father, the former king.\"\n\nKing Wen said: \"Then let us divine it.\"\n\nThe ministers said: \"This is the command of our former lord; let the king have no other thought. Why divine further?\" Thereupon they welcomed the old man of Zang and entrusted him with governance. No laws were altered, no decrees issued beyond the usual. After three years, King Wen surveyed the state and found that the ranks of scholars had dispersed, their factions dissolved; officials no longer cultivated virtue; and measures of grain dared not enter from the four borders. The dispersal of scholars and factions meant unity of purpose; officials’ failure to cultivate virtue meant shared endeavor; the refusal of grain tribute from the borders meant the lords harbored no divided loyalties.\n\nKing Wen then made him Grand Preceptor, facing north to inquire: \"Can this governance extend to all under Heaven?\" The old man of Zang gave no response, his words drifting away, and by nightfall he had fled, never to be heard of again.\n\nYan Yuan asked Confucius: \"Was King Wen still deluded? Why then did he dream?\" Confucius said: \"Hush, say no more. King Wen fulfilled it to the utmost—what need is there for criticism? He merely followed the moment’s course.\"\n\nLie Yukou was shooting for Bohun Wuren, drawing the bow to its fullest, balancing a cup of water on his elbow. When he loosed the arrow, one shaft followed another in perfect succession. At that moment, he was like a wooden figure. Bohun Wuren said: \"This is the shooting of one who shoots, not the shooting of one who does not shoot. If I were to climb a high mountain with you, tread on perilous rocks, and stand at the edge of a hundred-fathom abyss, could you shoot then?\" Thereupon Wuren ascended the mountain, trod the perilous rocks, stood at the brink of the abyss, his back to the edge, his feet half hanging over, then beckoned Lie Yukou forward. Lie Yukou prostrated himself, sweat streaming to his heels. Bohun Wuren said: \"The perfected man ascends to the azure sky above, plunges into the Yellow Springs below, roams to the eight limits, yet his spirit and qi remain unchanged. Now you tremble with fear in your eyes—you are in peril indeed!\"\n\nJian Wu asked Sunshu Ao: \"You served three times as Prime Minister without pride, and resigned three times without sorrow. At first I doubted you, but now I see your nostrils flare with ease—what is the secret of your heart?\" Sunshu Ao said: \"How do\n\nThus it is said: the world is but a single qi. Therefore the sage values unity.\n\nZhi said to the Yellow Emperor: \"I asked Wuwei Wei, but Wuwei Wei did not respond to me.\" Not that he would not respond to me—he did not know how to respond to me. \"I asked Kuang Qu, and Kuang Qu wished to tell me but did not tell me.\" Not that he would not tell me—he wished to tell me but forgot. \"Now I ask you, and you know—why then are you not close to the truth?\"\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said: \"He is truly so because he does not know; this one seems so because he has forgotten. You and I will never be close to the truth because we know.\"\n\nKuang Qu heard this and took the Yellow Emperor to be one who knew the words.\n\nHeaven and earth possess great beauty yet do not speak. The four seasons follow clear patterns yet do not debate. The myriad things have their inherent principles yet do not explain. The sage traces the beauty of heaven and earth and comprehends the principles of the myriad things. Thus the perfected man does nothing, the great sage takes no action—this is called observing heaven and earth.\n\nNow that numinous brightness and utmost refinement, along with the hundred transformations—whether things die or live, take shape or become round—none know their root. Yet all things have existed since ancient times, secure in themselves. The Six Directions are vast, yet they do not depart from its bounds; the tip of an autumn hair is minute, yet it depends on this to exist. In the world, nothing does not sink or float, yet nothing remains unchanged throughout life. Yin and yang and the four seasons move in their courses, each keeping to its proper order. Vast and indistinct, it seems to vanish yet remains; flowing and formless, it is spirit. The myriad things are nurtured by it yet do not know. This is called the root and foundation—by it one may observe heaven.\n\nNie Que asked Dao of Bei Yi. Bei Yi said: \"Straighten your form, unify your gaze, and the harmony of heaven will arrive. Gather in your knowledge, unify your measures, and spirit will come to dwell. Virtue will adorn you, the Dao will be your abode. Your eyes will be bright as a newborn calf’s, seeking nothing of the past.\"\n\nBefore the words were finished, Nie Que fell asleep. Bei Yi rejoiced greatly and walked away singing, saying: \"His form like withered bones, his heart like dead ashes, truly he knows the real. Not clinging to the past, vague and obscure, without mind—none can scheme with him. What manner of man is this?\"\n\nShun asked Cheng: \"Can the Dao be possessed?\" Cheng said: \"Your body is not your own—how can you possess the Dao?\" Shun said: \"If my body is not my own, then whose is it?\" Cheng said: \"It is heaven and earth’s entrusted form. Life is not your own—it is heaven and earth’s entrusted harmony. Nature and destiny are not your own—they are heaven and earth’s entrusted compliance. Children and grandchildren are not your own—they are heaven and earth’s entrusted shedding. Thus when you walk, you do not know where you are going; when you dwell, you do not know what you are holding; when you eat, you do not know the taste. It is the surging yang qi of heaven and earth—how could you possess it?\"\n\nConfucius asked Lao Cong: \"Today I have leisure—may I dare ask about the supreme Dao?\" Lao Cong said: \"Purify yourself with fasting, relax your mind and wash away its impurities, cleanse your spirit and strike down your knowledge. The Dao—how recondite and hard to speak of! I shall tell you its broad outlines.\"\n\nThe radiant emerges from the obscure, the ordered from the formless; spirit arises from the Dao, and form originates from essence. All things beget one another through form—thus creatures with nine orifices are born from the womb, and those with eight from the egg. Their coming knows no nearness, their going no boundary; no gate, no chamber, yet they extend boundlessly in all four directions. Those who roam here have limbs of strength, thoughts that penetrate, ears and eyes keen—yet their minds exert no labor, and their responses to things know no fixed pattern. Heaven cannot but be high, earth cannot but be vast, sun and moon cannot but move, and the myriad things cannot but flourish—such is the Dao.\n\nMoreover, vast learning does not necessarily bring knowledge, nor eloquence wisdom; the sage has already settled this. As for that which, when augmented, does not increase, and when diminished, does not decrease—this is what the sage preserves. Profound as the sea, towering in its endless return to the beginning, it measures and sustains the ten thousand things without exhaustion. Thus the Dao of the noble person lies beyond such distinctions. All things turn to it for sustenance yet are never depleted—such is the Dao.\n\nThere is a being within the central realm, neither yin nor yang, dwelling between heaven and earth, merely human for a time, yet destined to return to its origin. Viewed from its root, life is but the dark fermentation of things. Though lifespans vary, how great is the difference? A mere moment’s discourse. Why then debate the right and wrong of Yao and Jie? The fruit of the fern has its pattern, and human relations, though complex, follow their order. The sage encounters them without resistance, passes them without clinging. To harmonize and respond is virtue; to coincide and respond is the Dao. This is what empowers emperors and gives rise to kings.\n\nHuman life between heaven and earth is like a white colt passing a gap—suddenly, it is gone. Bursting forth, all things emerge; gently dispersing, all things return. Having transformed and lived, they transform again and die. Living creatures mourn them, humankind grieves. Loosening heaven’s bonds, unraveling its threads, in swirling confusion they drift—soul and spirit depart, and the body follows, returning to the great homecoming. The formless taking form, form dissolving into the formless—this all people know, yet it is not the concern of those who attain the Dao. This is what the common crowd debates. Those who attain do not debate; those who debate do not attain. Clear insight finds no value; eloquence is not as good as silence. The Dao cannot be heard; hearing it is not as good as blocking it—this is called the great attainment.\n\nDongguo Zi asked Zhuangzi: \"Where does the so-called Dao reside?\"\nZhuangzi said: \"It is nowhere absent.\"\nDongguo Zi said: \"You must specify.\"\nZhuangzi said: \"It is in the ants.\"\nDongguo Zi said: \"Why so low?\"\nZhuangzi said: \"It is in the millet stalks.\"\nDongguo Zi said: \"Why even lower?\"\nZhuangzi said: \"It is in the tiles and shards.\"\nDongguo Zi said: \"Why still lower?\"\nZhuangzi said: \"It is in excrement and urine.\"\nDongguo Zi did not respond.\nZhuangzi said: \"Your question fundamentally misses the essence. When Zheng Huo asked the market inspector about the fat content of a pig, the lower the part, the clearer the answer. You must not insist on a fixed place—nothing escapes the Dao. The supreme Dao is like this, and so too is great speech. *Zhou*, *bian*, and *xian*—these three are different names for the same reality, pointing to the one.\n\nOnce, wandering together in the Palace of Nothing-Whatsoever, we merged in discussion without end. Once, dwelling together in non-action—serene and still, vast and clear, harmonious and at ease. My will was empty, and though I went forth, I knew not where I arrived; though I departed and returned, I knew not where I stopped. I had already come and gone yet knew not where it would end. Wandering in the boundless, great knowledge enters yet knows no limit. That which gives form to things is not bounded by things, yet things have boundaries—what we call the boundaries of things are the boundaries of non-boundary, the boundary of the unbounded.\n\nWe speak of fullness and emptiness, decline and decay, yet that which is full and empty is not full and empty; that which declines and decays is not decline and decay. That which is root and branch is not root and branch; that which accumulates and disperses is not accumulation and dispersal.\"\n\nKuang He Gan and Shen Nong studied together under Old Dragon Ji. One day, Shen Nong was dozing with the door closed when Kuang He Gan burst in at noon, shouting: \"Old Dragon is dead!\"\nShen Nong, leaning on his staff, rose with a start, then tossed it aside and laughed, saying: \"Heaven knew my stubbornness and arrogance, so it cast me aside and let him die. Alas, master! You have perished without leaving me your wild words.\"\nHui Gang Diao heard of this and said: \"Those who embody the Dao are what the noble persons of the world strive for. Yet even in the Dao, he had not attained so much as a hair’s tip out of ten thousand parts, yet still knew to conceal his wild words before dying—how much more so for those who truly embody the Dao!\"\n\nTo see it is to see no form; to hear it is to hear no sound. In human discourse, it is called the obscure—this is how the Dao is discussed, yet it is not the Dao.\n\nThen Tai Qing asked Wu Qiong: \"Do you know the Dao?\"\nWu Qiong said: \"I do not know.\"\nHe asked Wu Wei, who said: \"I know the Dao.\"\nTai Qing said: \"Does your knowledge of the Dao have a pattern?\"\nWu Wei said: \"It does.\"\nTai Qing said: \"What is this pattern?\"\nWu Wei said: \"I know the Dao can be noble or base, can be gathered or dispersed—this is the pattern by which I know the Dao.\"\nTai Qing then asked Wu Shi: \"If so, then is Wu Qiong’s not-knowing or Wu Wei’s knowing correct, and which is mistaken?\"\nWu Shi said: \"Not-knowing is profound; knowing is shallow. Not-knowing is internal; knowing is external.\"\nThereupon Tai Qing sighed and said: \"Is not-knowing then knowing? Is knowing then not-knowing? Who knows the knowing of not-knowing?\"\nWu Shi said: \"The Dao cannot be heard; to hear it is not it.\"\n\nThe Dao cannot be seen; to see it is not it.\nThe Dao cannot be spoken; to speak it is not it.\nDo you know that the shapeless cannot be shaped?\n\nThe Dao should not be named.\n\nWu Shi said: \"One who answers when asked about the Dao does not know the Dao. Even the one who asks about the Dao has not heard of the Dao. The Dao admits no questions, and questions admit no answers. To question what admits no question is to ask into exhaustion; to answer what admits no answer is to lack inwardness. One who responds to exhausting questions with no inwardness—such a one outwardly does not observe the cosmos, inwardly does not know the Great Beginning. Thus they do not pass beyond Kunlun, nor wander in the Great Void.\"\n\nGuangyao asked Wu You: \"Does the Master exist? Or does he not exist?\"\nGuangyao could not frame his question, so he gazed intently at Wu You’s appearance—empty and still, vacant and silent. He looked at him all day and saw nothing; he listened and heard nothing; he reached out and grasped nothing.\n\nGuangyao said: \"This is perfection! Who could attain such a state? I can attain having and non-being, yet I have not attained non-being of non-being. How could one reach this state of nothingness?\"\n\nThe master smith of Great Horse who forged hooks was eighty years old, yet he never lost the finest hair’s edge.\n\nGreat Horse asked: \"Are you skillful, or do you possess the Dao?\"\nHe replied: \"I have my discipline. At twenty, I took delight in forging hooks. I saw nothing in other things—nothing but hooks did I examine. What I employed was the use of what was not employed, thus prolonging its use. How much more so for that which has no part unused? What thing does not draw upon this?\"\n\nRan Qiu asked Confucius: \"Was there anything knowable before Heaven and Earth existed?\"\nConfucius said: \"There was. The past was like the present.\"\nRan Qiu, perplexed by the answer, withdrew. The next day, he returned and said: \"Yesterday, I asked whether anything was knowable before Heaven and Earth existed. You said, 'There was. The past was like the present.' Yesterday, I was enlightened; today, I am benighted. May I ask what this means?\"\nConfucius said: \"Yesterday’s enlightenment came because the spirit received it first. Today’s benightedness comes because you now seek it with what is not spirit. There is no past, no present, no beginning, no end. Could there be descendants before there were descendants? It is possible.\"\nRan Qiu did not respond.\nConfucius said: \"Enough. There is no answer. Do not take life to give death, nor take death to give life. Do life and death depend on something? All share a single body. Is there something that existed before Heaven and Earth? That which gives rise to things is not itself a thing. Things emerge, yet nothing precedes them—just as there are things. Just as there are things, there is no end. Does the sage’s love for others ever end? It is simply drawn from this.\"\n\nYan Yuan asked Confucius: \"I once heard you say, 'Do not send off, do not welcome.' May I ask how one wanders?\"\nConfucius said: \"The ancients outwardly transformed while inwardly remaining unchanged. People today inwardly transform while outwardly remaining unchanged. One who transforms with things is one with what does not transform. Where transformation and non-transformation rest, where they blend without conflict—there, one must be without excess. The parks of Xi Wei, the gardens of the Yellow Emperor, the palaces of Yu, the halls of Tang and Wu—these were where the noble-minded, the masters of Ru and Mo, clashed with their 'rights' and 'wrongs.' How much more so with people today? The sage dwells among things without harming them. One who does not harm things—things cannot harm them. Only one who harms nothing can send off and welcome others. Mountains and forests, hills and plains—do they not make me joyful and glad? Yet before the joy is complete, sorrow follows. Joy and sorrow come—I cannot resist them; they depart—I cannot stop them. Alas! People of the world are but lodgers in the realm of things. They know what they encounter but not what they do not; they know what they can do but not what they cannot. To be without knowledge, without ability—this is something no one can avoid. Yet to strive to avoid what no one can avoid—is this not also lamentable? The ultimate word leaves words behind; the ultimate act leaves acts behind. To equal the knowledge of all that is known—this is shallow indeed.\"\n\n*The Southern Florescence Perfected Scripture*, Scroll Four: Miscellaneous Chapters, \"Gengsang Chu\" Twenty-Third\n\nAmong Lao Dan’s disciples was one named Gengsang Chu, who had partially grasped the Master’s Dao. He went north to dwell on Mount Weilü. Those among his retainers who were clever and knowing departed; those among his concubines who were soft and benevolent kept their distance. Only the hunchbacked and the idle remained to serve him. After three years, Weilü flourished.\n\nThe people of Weilü said to one another: \"When Master Gengsang first arrived, we were struck by his difference. Now, when we reckon our days, we find them lacking; when we reckon our years, we find them abundant. He must be a sage. Why do we not together offer him sacrifices as to an ancestral spirit, and worship him as we do the gods of soil and grain?\"\n\nGengsang Chu heard this and, facing south, remained unsettled.\nHis disciples found this strange.\nGengsang Chu said: \"Disciples, why do you find me strange? When spring’s qi arises, the hundred grasses grow; when autumn’s season arrives, the myriad treasures ripen. Do spring and autumn not act without purpose? The Dao of Heaven has already unfolded. I have heard that the perfected person dwells like a corpse in a walled hut, while the common people run wild, not knowing where to turn. Now, with the petty folk of Weilü whispering among themselves, wishing to place me among the worthy with sacrificial vessels—am I a man to be measured thus? This is why I remain unsettled by the words of Lao Dan.\"\nHis disciples said: \"Not so.\"\n\nFor in a ditch of ordinary width, the great fish has no room to turn its body, and the minnows and gudgeons become its rulers; on a hillock of but a few paces, the mighty beast has no space to stretch its limbs, and the foxes and weasels become its omens of good fortune. Moreover, to honor the worthy and grant office to the capable, to put goodness and benefit first—this has been so since the time of Yao and Shun, how much more so for the folk of Weilü! Master, you should heed this.\"\n\nGengsang Chu said: \"Come here, young ones. The beast that fills a carriage, once parted from the mountain and encased in armor, cannot escape the snares and nets; the fish that swallows a boat, once beached and deprived of water, may be vexed by ants. Thus birds and beasts do not weary of the heights, and fish and turtles do not weary of the depths. The man who preserves his form and life hides himself, and does not weary of the profound and distant—this alone suffices. As for those two, how could they be worthy of praise? In their disputations, they would recklessly hack at walls to plant mugwort and wormwood. Combing their hair to a fine sheen, counting grains of rice to cook—how could such petty acts save the age? When the worthy are raised up, the people contend; when cunning is employed, the people steal. These few things are not enough to enrich the people. The people are ever eager for gain: sons kill fathers, ministers kill rulers, in broad daylight they turn to robbery, at midday they bore through walls. I tell you, the root of great disorder must arise in the age of Yao and Shun, and its branches will endure for a thousand generations. A thousand generations hence, there will surely be men who devour one another.\"\n\nNanrong Chu straightened his robes, sat upright, and said: \"At my age, I am already advanced in years—how can I entrust my work and attain this cultivation?\"\n\nGengsang Chu said: \"Preserve your form, embrace your life, and do not let your thoughts and cares run wild. If you can do this for two years, you may reach this state.\"\n\nNanrong Chu said: \"The eye and the form—I do not see them as different, yet the blind cannot see themselves; the ear and the form—I do not see them as different, yet the deaf cannot hear themselves; the heart and the form—I do not see them as different, yet the mad cannot grasp themselves. The form and the form are set apart—could it be that things intervene? Do they seek one another yet fail to find? Now you tell me: preserve your form, embrace your life, do not let your thoughts and cares run wild. I have striven to hear the Dao and let it reach my ears.\"\n\nGengsang Chu said: \"My words are exhausted. The wasp of the day cannot transform the chrysalis of the night; the chicken of Yue cannot hatch the egg of the swan—only the chicken of Lu can do so. Chickens and chickens—their virtue is not different, yet some can and some cannot, for their capacities are inherently great or small. Now my capacity is small and insufficient to transform you. Why do you not go south to see Laozi?\"\n\nNanrong Chu prepared provisions, and after seven days and seven nights arrived at Laozi’s abode.\n\nLaozi said: \"Have you come from Chu?\"\n\nNanrong Chu said: \"Yes.\"\n\nLaozi said: \"Why have you come with so many people?\"\n\nNanrong Chu, startled, looked behind him.\n\nLaozi said: \"Do you not understand what I mean?\"\n\nNanrong Chu bowed his head in shame, then looked up and sighed: \"Now I have forgotten my answer and so lost my question.\"\n\nLaozi said: \"What do you mean?\"\n\nNanrong Chu said: \"If I am ignorant, people call me a fool. If I am wise, it only brings sorrow to my body. Without benevolence, I harm others; with benevolence, I bring sorrow upon myself. Without righteousness, I injure others; with righteousness, I bring sorrow upon myself. How can I escape this? These three sayings are my afflictions. I wish to rely on you to resolve them.\"\n\nLaozi said: \"A moment ago, I saw between your brows, and thereby understood you. Now you speak again and confirm it. You are as one who has lost his parents, holding up a pole to seek them in the sea. You are lost indeed, bewildered! You wish to return to your nature and disposition yet have no way in—how pitiable!\"\n\nNanrong Chu begged to enter and receive instruction. He summoned what he loved and cast aside what he despised. After ten days of self-torment, he again saw Laozi.\n\nLaozi said: \"You have cleansed yourself—how dense and troubled you still are! Yet within, you seethe as if still harboring resentment. He who is bound without cannot be restrained by force, for he will grow stronger within; he who is constrained within cannot be seized by deception, for he will lash out without. He who is bound both without and within cannot be upheld by the Dao and virtue—how much less one who abandons the Dao and acts on his own?\"\n\nNanrong Chu said: \"When a villager is ill, and the villagers ask after him, if the sick man can describe his illness, then though he suffers, he is not yet truly ill. As for my hearing of the great Dao, it is like taking medicine that only worsens the disease. I wish only to hear the classic of preserving life.\"\n\nLaozi said: \"The classic of preserving life—can you embrace the One? Can you not lose it? Can you know good and ill without divination? Can you stop? Can you cease? Can you set aside others and seek within yourself? Can you be supple? Can you be yielding? Can you be like a child? The child wails all day yet its throat does not grow hoarse—so perfect is its harmony; it clenches its fist all day yet its hand does not cramp—so complete is its virtue; it gazes all day yet its eyes do not blink—its focus is not on externals. It walks without knowing where it goes, dwells without knowing what it does, drifts with things and moves with the current—this is the classic of preserving life.\"\n\nNanrong Chu said: \"Then is this the virtue of the perfected person?\"\n\nLaozi said: \"No.\"\n\nThis is what is called \"melting like ice, dissolving like frost.\"\n\nThe perfected person shares sustenance with the earth and rejoices with heaven, not entangled by the gains and losses of others, not engaging in strangeness, not scheming together, not acting in concert. Supple they depart, yielding they arrive—this is the classic of preserving life.\n\nNanrong Chu said: \"Then is this perfection?\"\n\nLaozi said: \"Not yet. I have already told you: can you be like a child? The child moves without knowing what it does, walks without knowing where it goes, its body like the branch of a withered tree, its heart like dead ashes. In such a state, misfortune does not arrive, nor does fortune come. With neither misfortune nor fortune, how could there be human calamity?\n\nWhen the cosmos is at peace and settled, it emits the light of heaven. Those who emit the light of heaven are seen as human. Those who cultivate themselves now possess constancy; those who possess constancy are abandoned by others yet aided by heaven. Those abandoned by others are called the people of heaven; those aided by heaven are called the sons of heaven.\n\nThe learner learns what cannot be learned; the doer does what cannot be done; the debater debates what cannot be debated. To know when to stop at what cannot be known—this is the ultimate. If there are those who do not conform to this, the balance of heaven will destroy them.\n\nPrepare things to sustain the form, conceal the unforeseen to nurture the heart, revere the center to reach the other. If despite this, myriad evils still arrive, they are from heaven, not from man—they cannot disturb completion or enter the numinous terrace. The numinous terrace holds something yet does not know what it holds, and there is that which cannot be held.\n\nIf one does not see the sincerity within oneself and acts, each act is inappropriate; if karma enters and does not depart, each change brings loss. Those who do evil in the light are punished by others; those who do evil in the dark are punished by spirits. Only those who are enlightened about others and enlightened about spirits can walk alone.\n\nThose who hold inner bonds act without fame; those who hold outer bonds aspire to stipulated rewards. Acting without fame, only the mediocre gain luster; aspiring to stipulated rewards, they are but merchants—others see their divergence as towering. Those who exhaust things are entered by things; those who contend with things cannot even contain themselves, how can they contain others? Those who cannot contain others have no intimacy; those with no intimacy are forsaken by all.\n\nNo weapon is more invasive than the will—even the *mo* and *zou* blades are inferior. No enemy is greater than yin and yang, from which there is no escape within heaven and earth. It is not that yin and yang harm them, but that the heart commands it.\n\nThe Dao flows through. Its division is its completion, its completion is its destruction. What is detestable about division is that it divides in order to prepare; what is detestable about preparation is that it prepares for something. Thus, to depart and not return is to see one’s ghost; to depart and obtain is called obtaining death. To perish yet have substance is one kind of ghost.\n\nBy using the formed to model the formless, one may attain stability. Departing without root, entering without aperture. Having substance yet no place, having length yet no beginning or end, having an exit yet no aperture—this is having substance. Having substance yet no place is space. Having length yet no beginning or end is time. There is life, there is death, there is departure, there is entry. Departing and entering without seeing its form—this is called the Gate of Heaven. The Gate of Heaven is Nonbeing. The myriad things emerge from Nonbeing. Being cannot use being to create being; it must emerge from Nonbeing, and Nonbeing is no Nonbeing.\n\nThe sage conceals himself therein.\n\nThe ancients—some of their knowledge reached the utmost. To what extent? Some believed there had never yet been things—this is the utmost, the ultimate, beyond which nothing can be added. Next were those who believed things existed, taking life as loss and death as return—thus they were already divided. Next were those who said: first there was Nonbeing, then there was life, and life swiftly became death. They took Nonbeing as the head, life as the body, and death as the corpse. Who knows the one who guards the unity of being, nonbeing, life, and death? I would befriend such a one.\n\nThough these three differ, they belong to the same clan—like the *Zhao* and *Jing* lineages, the *Zhu* and *Dai* families, the *Jia* clan, the *Zhu* and *Feng* houses—not one and the same. There is life, like a sealed letter, unfolding day by day. I have spoken of this unfolding, but it is not what I meant. Nevertheless, it cannot be known.\n\nThe victory of the *la* sacrifice can be dispersed yet cannot be dispersed. The observer of a chamber is thorough in the ancestral temple, but what of its collapse? This is to cite the unfolding. Let me speak constantly of this unfolding.\n\nThus, taking life as the root and knowledge as the teacher, one rides upon right and wrong, resulting in names and realities. Taking oneself as the standard, one makes others conform to one’s own measure, using death to repay one’s principles. Those who act thus use action as wisdom, non-action as foolishness, thoroughness as fame, and poverty as disgrace—this unfolding is the way of people today, like the cicada and the fledgling dove in their sameness.\n\nIf you tread on a market-goer’s foot, you apologize with alarm; if it is an elder brother, you soothe him; if it is a parent, you stop at that. Thus it is said: the utmost ritual does not involve others, the utmost righteousness does not involve things, the utmost knowledge does not scheme, the utmost benevolence has no intimacy, the utmost trust dispenses with metal.\n\nBreak the fervor of the will, untie the knots of the heart, cast off the burdens of virtue, clear the blockages of the Dao. Wealth, honor, prominence, dignity, fame, and profit—these six stir the will. Appearance, movement, complexion, pattern, qi, and intent—these six entangle the heart. Aversion, desire, joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness—these six burden virtue. Advancement, retreat, taking, giving, knowledge, and ability—these six obstruct the Dao. When these four sets of six do not agitate the breast, one is upright; upright, one is tranquil; tranquil, one is luminous; luminous, one is empty; empty, one does nothing yet nothing is left undone.\n\nThe Dao is the reverence of virtue.\n\nLife is the radiance of virtue; nature is the essence of life. The movement of nature is called action; the artificiality of action is called loss.\n\n\"Likeness\" is connection; \"knowledge\" is planning. What knowledge does not know is like a sidelong glance. Movement from inevitability is called virtue; movement without self is called governance. Names may oppose each other, yet realities align.\n\nYi excelled at hitting the subtle mark yet was clumsy at preventing others from praising him. The sage excels at Heaven yet is clumsy with men. Only the whole person can excel at Heaven while contending with men. Only the creature can be a creature; only the creature can be Heaven. The whole person detests Heaven, detests men’s Heaven—how much more my Heaven among men!\n\nA sparrow that comes to Yi is certain to be caught—this is success. If one takes the world as one’s cage, then no sparrow can escape. Thus Tang used a kitchen servant to enclose Yi Yin, and Duke Mu of Qin used five sheepskins to enclose Bai Li Xi. Therefore, if one does not use what they love to enclose them, nothing can be obtained.\n\nThe crippled man flaunts his adornments, rejecting external praise and blame. The convict climbs high without fear, having abandoned life and death. To return to speech without offering and forget others—by forgetting others, one thereby becomes a Heavenly person. Thus, one who is revered yet feels no joy, or insulted yet feels no anger, is one who harmonizes with Heaven’s harmony.\n\nWhen anger arises from non-anger, then anger emerges from non-anger. When action arises from non-action, then action emerges from non-action. To desire stillness, level the qi; to desire spirit, follow the heart. In action, to desire appropriateness, adhere to inevitability. The category of inevitability is the Way of the sage.\n\n---\n\n*Master Xu Wugui*, through Lady Shang, was received by Marquis Wu of Wei. The marquis greeted him, saying, \"Master, you are weary—wearied by the toil of mountains and forests, and thus willing to see me.\"\n\nXu Wugui replied, \"It is I who weary you—what weariness have you for me? If you indulge your desires and prolong your likes and dislikes, the essence of your nature and life will sicken. If you suppress your desires and learn your likes and dislikes, your ears and eyes will sicken. I would weary you—what weariness have you for me?\"\n\nThe marquis, startled, made no reply. After a moment, Xu Wugui said, \"Let me tell you: I read dogs. The inferior dog stops at being full—this is the virtue of a wildcat. The middling dog looks as if watching the sun; the superior dog seems to have lost its unity. But my reading of dogs is not as good as my reading of horses.\n\nIn my reading of horses, the straight align with the plumb line, the curved with the hook, the square with the carpenter’s square, the round with the compass—these are the state’s horses, yet they do not compare to the world’s horses. The world’s horses have perfect material: seeming anxious, seeming lost, as if they have forgotten their unity. Such horses surpass all, leaving no trace—one cannot know where they go.\"\n\nThe marquis was greatly pleased and laughed. When Xu Wugui left, Lady Shang asked, \"Master, how did you alone delight my lord? Those who please my lord do so by expounding the *Odes*, *Documents*, *Rites*, and *Music* in breadth, or by citing the *Golden Tablets and Six Strategies* in depth. Those who serve him with great merit are countless, yet my lord has never once smiled. How did you delight him so?\"\n\nXu Wugui said, \"I simply told him how I read dogs and horses.\"\n\nLady Shang said, \"Is that all?\"\n\nHe replied, \"Have you not heard of the exiles of Yue? After a few days away from their state, they rejoice at seeing those they know. After a month, they rejoice at seeing those they once saw in their state. After a year, they rejoice even at seeing those who resemble people. Is it not that the longer one is away from others, the deeper the longing for them?\n\nThose who flee into the void tread the paths of foxes and weasels, treading lightly in the emptiness. When they hear the sound of human footsteps, they rejoice—how much more when brothers and kin drink and feast beside them! For too long, no one has offered my lord the medicine of a true person’s words by his side.\"\n\nXu Wugui later saw the marquis, who said, \"Master, you dwell in the mountains and forests, eating taro and chestnuts, disdaining onions and leeks, yet you deign to visit me—how long it has been! Are you now old? Do you crave the taste of wine and meat? Or do you bring blessings to my altars of soil and grain?\"\n\nXu Wugui replied, \"I, Wugui, was born poor and lowly and have never dared to taste your wine and meat. I came to weary you.\"\n\nThe marquis said, \"How so? Why weary me?\"\n\nHe replied, \"To weary your spirit and form.\"\n\nThe marquis said, \"What do you mean?\"\n\nXu Wugui replied, \"The nurturing of Heaven and Earth is one. Ascending high does not make one tall, nor does dwelling low make one short. Yet you alone, as lord of ten thousand chariots, bring suffering to the people of your state to nourish your ears, eyes, nose, and mouth—your spirit does not consent to this. The spirit delights in harmony and detests perversity. Perversity is a sickness, and so I weary you. It is only your sickness that wearies you—why is this?\"\n\nThe marquis said, \"I have long wished to meet you. I wish to love the people and practice righteousness by laying down arms—would this be possible?\"\n\nXu Wugui said, \"It would not. Loving the people is the beginning of harming them; practicing righteousness and laying down arms is the root of creating arms. If you proceed thus, you will likely not succeed. All completed beauty is a dangerous tool. Though you act with benevolence and righteousness, you will nearly become false. Form inevitably produces form, completion inevitably invites attack, and change inevitably brings external strife. You must not array grand cranes in the towers of your palace, nor parade fine steeds in the courtyards of your halls. Do not store resentment in your gains, do not overcome others with skill, do not overcome others with schemes, do not overcome others with war. Those who kill the people’s soldiers and seize others’ lands to nourish their own desires and spirits—how can one know which side is good in such a war? Where does victory lie? If you cannot stop, cultivate sincerity within your heart to respond to the feelings of Heaven and Earth, and do not obstruct them. The people are already dead and free—how will you use the laying down of arms?\n\nOnce, the Yellow Emperor wished to visit Great Vision on Mount Juci. Fangming drove his chariot, Changyu rode as attendant, Zhangruo and Weipeng led the horses, while Kunhe and Guji followed in the rear carriage. When they reached the wilds of Xiangcheng, the Seven Sages all lost their way and had nowhere to ask directions. They happened upon a boy herding horses and asked him the way. The boy said, 'Do you know Mount Juci?' 'Yes,' they replied. 'Do you know where Great Vision dwells?' 'Yes,' he said. The Yellow Emperor exclaimed, 'How extraordinary, this little boy! Not only does he know Mount Juci, but he also knows where Great Vision dwells. Allow me to ask how to govern the world.' The boy said, 'Governing the world is just like this—what more is there to do? When I was young, I roamed freely within the Six Directions. Then I fell ill with a sudden affliction, and an elder taught me, saying, \"Ride the sun’s chariot and roam the wilds of Xiangcheng.\" Now that my illness has slightly improved, I am about to roam beyond the Six Directions again. Governing the world is just like this—what more is there to do?'\"\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said, \"Governing the world is truly not your concern. Nevertheless, allow me to ask about governing the world.\" The boy declined. The Yellow Emperor asked again. The boy said, \"What makes governing the world different from herding horses? It is merely a matter of removing what harms the horses.\" The Yellow Emperor bowed twice, touching his forehead to the ground, and called him \"Heavenly Master\" before withdrawing.\n\nThe contemplative scholar finds no joy without the vicissitudes of thought, the eloquent scholar finds no joy without the order of discourse, and the scrutinizing scholar finds no joy without the sting of reproach—all are confined by things.\n\nThose who summon the age to court, the common folk who covet office, the strong who boast of hardship, the brave who rush into peril, warriors who delight in battle, recluses who cling to fame, legalists who expand governance, ritualists who refine demeanor, and the benevolent who value connections—each has their place.\n\nFarmers find no fellowship without the toil of clearing fields, merchants find no fellowship without the bustle of markets. Common folk are spurred by daily labor, artisans take pride in their tools’ craftsmanship. Without accumulating wealth, the greedy grow anxious; without surpassing power, the proud grow sorrowful. Those who delight in change seize the moment when it serves them, yet cannot remain inactive. All these follow the turning of the seasons, unyielding to transformation.\n\nThey exhaust their nature, submerge themselves in the ten thousand things, and never return for the rest of their lives—how lamentable!\n\nZhuangzi said, \"If an archer hits the mark without aiming, we call him a skilled shot. If everyone in the world were like Yi, would that be acceptable?\"\nHuizi said, \"It would.\"\nZhuangzi said, \"If the world had no shared standard of rightness, and each affirmed only what they deemed right, would it be acceptable for everyone in the world to be like Yao?\"\nHuizi said, \"It would.\"\nZhuangzi said, \"Then among the Confucians, Mohists, Yangists, and Bingists—four schools—and you, making five, which one is truly right? Or is it like the case of Lu Ju? His disciple said, 'I have grasped the Master’s Way! I can boil a cauldron in winter and make ice in summer.' Lu Ju said, 'This merely summons yang with yang and yin with yin—it is not what I call the Way. Let me show you my Way.' Thereupon, he tuned a zither, placing one in the hall and one in the chamber. When he plucked the *gong* note, the *gong* note resonated; when he plucked the *jiao* note, the *jiao* note resonated—their harmonies were identical. But if he adjusted one string so that it no longer fit the five notes and plucked it, all twenty-five strings vibrated, yet the sound was not distinct from the rest, though it became the ruler of the tones. Is this not akin to your case?\"\nHuizi said, \"Now the Confucians, Mohists, Yangists, and Bingists all contend with me in debate, clashing in words and overpowering in voice, yet none have ever proven me wrong. How does this compare?\"\nZhuangzi said, \"A man from Qi who lost his son in Song had a fate that was not whole; when he sought a lost bell, he bound it tightly; when he sought Tang’s son, he never left his domain—he left something behind. A man from Chu who lodged in a place where arrows were stored met with boatmen at midnight in a deserted land. Though he never left the cliff, he was enough to incur resentment.\n\nZhuangzi, while attending a funeral, passed by Huizi’s grave. Turning to his followers, he said, \"A man from Ying had plaster splattered on the tip of his nose, as thin as a fly’s wing. He had Carpenter Shi shave it off. Carpenter Shi swung his axe with the force of the wind, listening as he struck, removing all the plaster without harming the nose. The man from Ying stood unmoved. When the Lord of Song Yuan heard of this, he summoned Carpenter Shi and said, 'Try to do it for me.' Carpenter Shi replied, 'Your servant once could do this, but the material for my skill has long been dead. Since the Master’s passing, I have had no one to work with—I have no one to speak to.'\"\n\nWhen Guan Zhong fell ill, Duke Huan asked him, \"Your illness has grown severe. If it worsens, to whom should I entrust the state?\" Guan Zhong said, \"Whom does the Duke wish to appoint?\" The Duke said, \"Bao Shuya.\" Guan Zhong said, \"No. He is a meticulous and upright gentleman. Those who do not measure up to him, he does not associate with. Once he hears of someone’s fault, he never forgets it. If he governed the state, he would soon offend the ruler above and alienate the people below. It would not be long before he incurred the Duke’s displeasure.\" The Duke said, \"Then who is suitable?\" Guan Zhong replied, \"If you must choose, then Yang Peng will do. His character is such that he forgets those above and rebels against those below. He feels ashamed of not being like the Yellow Emperor and pities those who do not measure up to himself. To distribute virtue is called sageliness; to distribute wealth is called worthiness. To rule others with worthiness never wins their hearts; to humble oneself with worthiness never fails to win them. He is deaf to affairs of state and blind to matters of the household. If you must choose, then Yang Peng will do.\"\n\nKing Wu was floating on the river and ascended Mount Ju. The troop of monkeys, seeing him, fled in alarm and hid in the dense thickets. One monkey, however, lingered, swinging its arms and scratching, displaying its skill before the king. The king shot at it, and the monkey deftly caught the swift arrow. The king ordered his attendants to rush forward and shoot, and the monkey was seized and killed. The king turned to his friend Yan Buyi and said, \"This monkey relied on its skill and agility to defy me, bringing about its own demise. Take heed! Alas, do not let your demeanor make you arrogant toward others.\" Yan Buyi returned home and studied under Dong Wu to uproot his arrogance. He renounced pleasure and declined fame. After three years, the people of the state praised him.\n\nNanbo Zijing sat leaning on his armrest, gazing at the sky and sighing. Yan Chengzi entered and said, \"Master, you are the most extraordinary of beings. Can the body truly be made like withered bones, the heart like dead ashes?\" He replied, \"Once I dwelled in a mountain cave. At that time, when the fields of Qi caught a glimpse of me, the people of the state all celebrated three times.\"\n\nI must precede them, and thus they know it; I must offer it, and thus they purify themselves for it. If I did not possess it, how could they know it? If I did not offer it, how could they purify themselves for it? Alas! I grieve for those who lose themselves, and I grieve again for those who grieve for them, and I grieve yet again for those who grieve for the grief of others—ever receding with each passing day.\n\nWhen Confucius traveled to Chu, the king of Chu offered him wine. Sunshu Ao stood holding the goblet, while Shinan Yiliao received the wine and made an offering, saying, \"Men of old have spoken of this.\" Confucius replied, \"I have heard of the speech that is without words, yet I have never spoken of it—until now.\" Shinan Yiliao juggled his balls to resolve the feud between two families, while Sunshu Ao slept soundly, holding a feather fan, and the people of Ying laid down their weapons. Confucius wished for a beak three feet long.\n\nWhat they call the Dao that is not the Dao, this is what I call the eloquence of wordlessness. Thus virtue gathers where the Dao is one. And speech rests where knowledge knows no more—this is perfection. Where the Dao is one, virtue cannot be the same; where knowledge knows no more, eloquence cannot encompass it. Names like those of the Confucians and Mohists bring only misfortune.\n\nThus the sea does not refuse the streams that flow into it—such is its greatness. The sage embraces heaven and earth, bestowing blessings upon the world, yet no one knows his name. Therefore, in life he holds no rank, in death he leaves no wealth; he does not accumulate goods, nor does he establish a name—this is what is called the Great Man.\n\nA dog is not good because it barks well, nor is a man worthy because he speaks well—how much less so for one who is great! To be great is not enough to be called great—how much less so for virtue! Greatness is complete, yet nothing compares to heaven and earth. What do they seek, and yet are complete? One who knows completeness seeks nothing, loses nothing, discards nothing, and does not let things alter his true self. Turning inward without exhaustion, following the ancient without friction—this is the sincerity of the Great Man.\n\nMaster Jing had eight sons. He lined them up before him and summoned Jiufang Yan, saying, \"Examine my sons for me and tell me which one is most auspicious.\" Jiufang Yan replied, \"Kun is the most auspicious.\" Master Jing started in surprise and joy, asking, \"In what way?\" Jiufang Yan said, \"Kun will share the ruler’s table and feast for the rest of his life.\" Master Jing’s face fell, and tears welled up as he said, \"What has my son done to reach such an extreme?\" Jiufang Yan replied, \"One who shares the ruler’s table brings blessings to three clans—how much more so to his parents! Now that you have heard this and weep, you reject good fortune. Your son is auspicious, but you are not.\"\n\nMaster Jing said, \"Yan, how could you possibly know that Kun is auspicious? His fate is bound to meat and wine, entering only his nose and mouth—how could you know where it comes from? I have never herded cattle, yet a calf was born in the inner chamber; I have never hunted, yet a quail hatched in the granary. If you find this strange, why? Those with whom I associate wander between heaven and earth. With them, I roam in joy beneath the sky and feast upon the earth. I do not involve myself in their affairs, nor do I scheme with them, nor do I share in their strange omens. I ride the sincerity of heaven and earth without letting things entangle me; I drift with them, unburdened by worldly concerns. Now, suddenly, there is this worldly reward. Whenever there are strange signs, there must be strange conduct. Alas, this is not the fault of my son or me—it is heaven’s doing! That is why I weep.\"\n\nBefore long, Kun was sent to Yan. Bandits seized him on the road. To keep him whole and offer him as a sacrifice would be difficult; to cut off his foot would be easier. So they cut off his foot and presented him as a treasure to the state of Qi, where he ended up at Duke Qu’s gate, eating meat for the rest of his life.\n\nNie Que met Xu You and asked, \"Where are you going?\" Xu You replied, \"I am fleeing from Yao.\" Nie Que asked, \"Why?\" Xu You said, \"Yao is so earnestly benevolent that I fear he will be ridiculed by the world. Future generations may even turn to cannibalism. The people are not hard to gather: love them, and they draw near; benefit them, and they come; praise them, and they are encouraged; bring them what they hate, and they scatter. Love and benefit arise from benevolence and righteousness, but those who abandon benevolence and righteousness are few, while those who profit from them are many. The practice of benevolence and righteousness lacks sincerity—it is merely a tool for the greedy and rapacious. Thus, one man’s judgment brings profit to the world, yet it is like a single glance. Yao knows that worthy men benefit the world, but he does not know that they also harm it. Only those outside the realm of worthiness understand this.\"\n\nThere are those who are *nuanmei*, those who are *runxu*, and those who are *juanlou*. The *nuanmei* learn the words of a single master and delight in them privately, believing themselves sufficient, unaware that nothing has truly begun—this is what is called *nuanmei*. The *runxu* are like lice on a pig: they choose the sparse bristles and think it a vast palace, nestling between the hooves and thighs, believing it a safe and comfortable dwelling. They do not know that one day the butcher will roll up his sleeves, spread straw, and light a fire, and they will burn along with the pig. They advance and retreat within their narrow domain—this is what is called *runxu*. The *juanlou* is like Shun. Mutton does not long for ants, but ants long for mutton because mutton has a strong scent. Shun had a rank odor in his conduct, and the people delighted in him. Thus, he moved three times, and each time his settlement grew, until at Deng’s ruins he had a hundred thousand households. Yao, hearing of Shun’s worthiness, raised him from the barren land, saying, \"I hope to benefit from his presence.\" Shun was raised from the barren land, and as his years and teeth grew long, his hearing and sight declined, yet he could not retire—this is what is called *juanlou*.\n\nThus, the spirit-like man dislikes the multitude’s arrival, for when the multitude arrives, they do not harmonize, and when they do not harmonize, no benefit comes of it.\n\nThus, he has no extreme attachments, no extreme aversions, embracing virtue and kindling harmony to follow the world—this is called the *True Man*. To ants, he discards cunning; to fish, he finds the right measure; to sheep, he abandons intent.\n\nWith the eye, he sees the eye; with the ear, he hears the ear; with the heart, he returns to the heart. Such a one is as level as a carpenter’s line, and in change, he follows the natural course.\n\nThe *True Man* of old awaited all with Heaven, not imposing man upon Heaven. The *True Man* of old gained life through it, lost it through death; gained death through it, lost it through life.\n\nMedicines—some are *dong*, some are *jiegeng*, some are *jiyong*, some are *shiling*—each in its time serves as the sovereign remedy. How can they all be enumerated?\n\nGoujian, with three thousand armored men, perched on Kuaiji. Only Zhong knew how ruin could be preserved, yet only Zhong did not know why his own person brought sorrow.\n\nThus, the crow’s eye has its destination, the crane’s step has its measure—releasing them brings sorrow.\n\nThus, the wind passing over a river diminishes it, the sun passing over a river diminishes it. If only the wind and sun were to guard the river together, the river would still deem itself untouched, for it relies on its source to flow onward.\n\nThus, water guards earth with precision, shadows guard people with precision, things guard things with precision.\n\nThus, the eye’s clarity is perilous, the ear’s acuity is but a beginning, the heart’s pursuit is but a beginning. All that relies on the storehouse is perilous, and once peril is formed, it cannot be amended.\n\nMisfortune’s growth is dense and clustered; its reversal is swift, yet its fruition waits long. Yet people treasure it as their own—is this not lamentable?\n\nThus, states perish and people are slaughtered without end, for they do not question what is right.\n\nThus, the foot treads upon the earth, and though it treads, it relies on what it does not tread to walk broadly. Man’s knowledge is scant, and though scant, he relies on what he does not know to comprehend Heaven’s intent.\n\nKnow the Great Oneness, know the Great Yin, know the Great Eye, know the Great Balance, know the Great Square, know the Great Faith, know the Great Constancy—this is perfection.\n\nThe Great Oneness unites them, the Great Yin dissolves them, the Great Eye sees them, the Great Balance harmonizes them, the Great Square embodies them, the Great Faith verifies them, the Great Constancy sustains them.\n\nExhaust Heaven’s fullness, follow illumination, grasp the pivot, begin with that which is other.\n\nThen, in dissolving them, one seems not to dissolve; in knowing them, one seems not to know. It is by not knowing that one comes to know.\n\nIn questioning, there can be no bounds, yet there can be no lack of bounds. Though tangled and slippery, it has substance—past and present do not replace it, nor can it be diminished. Can this not be called the great exaltation and collapse?\n\nWhy not simply question this? Why be so perplexed? Resolving perplexity with non-perplexity, returning to non-perplexity—this is the ultimate non-perplexity.\n\n---\n\n*The Southern Florescence: True Classic, Scroll Four – \"Miscellaneous Chapters: Zeyang, Twenty-Five\"*\n\nZeyang traveled in Chu. Yijie spoke of him to the king, but the king did not summon him. Yijie returned.\n\nPengyang met Wang Guo and said, \"Master, why not recommend me to the king?\"\n\nWang Guo replied, \"I am not as good as Gongyue Xiu.\"\n\nPengyang asked, \"What does Gongyue Xiu do?\"\n\nHe said, \"In winter, he retreats alone to the river; in summer, he rests in the mountain thickets. If someone passes by and asks, he says, 'This is my dwelling.' Yijie could not do this—how much less could I? I am not even Yijie’s equal.\"\n\nAs for Yijie’s character: he had no virtue but possessed knowledge. He did not approve of himself, yet used this to mystify his associations, stumbling blindly into the realm of wealth and honor. He did not assist others with virtue but instead aided their dissipation.\n\nThe frozen borrow clothes from spring; the scorched seek winter’s cool breeze.\n\nThe King of Chu’s character was one of imposing form and severity. In punishing crimes, he was as relentless as a tiger. Without flatterers and upright virtue, who could sway him?\n\nThus, the sage—when impoverished, makes his family forget their poverty; when prosperous, makes kings and lords forget their ranks and emoluments, transforming them to humility.\n\nToward things, he delights in them; toward people, he rejoices in their communion while preserving himself. Thus, sometimes without speaking, he harmonizes others; standing beside them, he transforms them.\n\nThe proper roles of father and son—where do they return to dwell? One inquires into where they are applied. His distance from the hearts of men is thus.\n\nThus, they await Gongyue Xiu.\n\nThe sage’s understanding is thorough and all-encompassing, embracing all as one, yet unaware of how this is so—it is his nature.\n\nResponding to fate and acting with Heaven as his teacher, others then follow and name it. Yet in his concern for knowledge, his actions seldom last long—how can they have an end?\n\nOne born beautiful—people offer him a mirror. If not told, he does not know his beauty surpasses others. Whether he knows or does not know, hears or does not hear, his joy never ceases. People’s fondness for him never ceases—it is his nature.\n\nThe sage’s love for others—people give him a name. If not told, he does not know his love for others. Whether he knows or does not know, hears or does not hear, his love never ceases. People’s comfort in him never ceases—it is his nature.\n\nAn old state, an old capital—gazing upon them brings delight. Even if hills, mounds, grasses, and trees encroach, covering nine-tenths, the delight remains.\n\nDeath is seeing what is seen, hearing what is heard—like a hundred-foot tower suspended to answer the many questions.\n\nRan Xiangshi grasped the center of the ring and followed completion, moving with things without end or beginning, almost without time.\n\nOne who daily transforms with things is the one who does not transform. Once set aside—\n\nThe one who takes Heaven as his teacher yet cannot attain it, who follows things in pursuit—how can his affairs proceed?\n\nThe sage has never begun with Heaven, never begun with man, never begun with a beginning, never begun with things. He moves with the world without ceasing, his actions complete without excess—how does he unite with them?\n\nTang obtained his steward, the Gatekeeper Yin Deng, to transmit this—following the master without confinement. Obtaining its \"following completion,\" he became the steward of its name. This name, though excessive in method, attained its dual vision.\n\nConfucius, exhausting his thoughts, transmitted it as well.\n\nRong Chengmin said: \"Remove the days, and there are no years; no inner, no outer.\"\n\nWei Ying made a pact with Marquis Tian Mou, but Marquis Tian Mou betrayed it. Wei Ying grew enraged and was about to send an assassin. Xishou, hearing of this, found it shameful: \"You are a lord of ten thousand chariots, yet you would follow the ways of a common man? Yan requests to receive two hundred thousand armored troops to attack him on your behalf, capturing his people, seizing his cattle and horses, so that his lord’s inner heat erupts upon his back. Then we shall uproot his state. Ji will flee, and then we shall strike his back and break his spine.\"\n\nJizi, hearing of this, found it shameful: \"To build a city wall seventy feet high—once it reaches seventy feet, to then tear it down—this is the toil that convict laborers lament. Now, for seven years, no war has arisen; this is the foundation of your kingship. Yan is a disturber of order; he must not be heeded.\"\n\nHuazi, hearing of this, found it contemptible: \"Those who speak well of attacking Qi are disturbers of order; those who speak well of not attacking are also disturbers of order. To call both attacking and not attacking disturbers of order—this too is a disturber of order.\"\n\nThe lord asked: \"Then what should be done?\"\n\nHe replied: \"My lord, seek only the Dao.\"\n\nHuizi, hearing this, went to see Dai Jinren. Jinren said: \"There is a creature called the snail—do you know of it?\"\n\nThe lord said: \"Yes.\"\n\n\"On the left horn of the snail is a state called Chushi, and on the right horn, a state called Manshi. At times, they contend over land and wage war, leaving tens of thousands of corpses in their wake. The pursuit of the routed lasts fifteen days before they return.\"\n\nThe lord said: \"Alas!\"\n\n\"Is this merely empty talk?\"\n\nHe replied: \"Let your servant demonstrate its truth to you. Does my lord imagine the four directions and the realms above and below to have limits?\"\n\nThe lord said: \"They are without limit.\"\n\nHe said: \"To know the mind roams in the boundless and yet returns to the states that lie within reach—do they seem as if they exist, as if they do not?\"\n\nThe lord said: \"So it is.\"\n\nHe said: \"Within the reachable lies Wei; within Wei lies Liang; within Liang lies the king. Is there any distinction between the king and the Manshi?\"\n\nThe lord said: \"There is no distinction.\"\n\nThe guest departed, and the lord remained in a daze, as if something had been lost.\n\nWhen the guest had gone, Huizi came to see him. The lord said: \"That guest was a great man—even a sage would not suffice to match him.\"\n\nHuizi said: \"When one blows through a pipe, there is still a sound; when one blows across a sword’s ring, there is but a faint whistle. Yao and Shun are those whom men praise; yet to speak of Yao and Shun before Dai Jinren is like that faint whistle.\n\nWhen Confucius traveled to Chu, he lodged at the thatched hut by Ant Mound. His neighbors, a husband and wife with their servants, climbed to the roof. Zilu said: 'What are those bustling figures doing?'\n\nZhongni said: 'They are the servants of a sage. He buries himself among the people, conceals himself at the margins. His voice fades, yet his will is boundless. Though his mouth speaks, his heart has never truly spoken. He goes against the world, yet his mind disdains to accompany it. Such a one is a 'land-sunk' man—is this not the Market South’s Yi Liao?'\n\nZilu asked to go and summon him. Confucius said: 'Enough. He knows that I am known to him, that I am traveling to Chu, and that I would surely have the king of Chu summon him. He would take me for a flatterer. One like that feels shame even to hear the words of a flatterer—how much more to see him in person? And how could he remain here?'\n\nZilu went to look, but the house was empty.\n\nThe Warden of Changwu asked Zilao: 'In governing, do not be reckless; in ordering the people, do not be careless. Once, when I planted grain, I plowed recklessly, and the harvest repaid me in kind; I weeded carelessly, and the harvest repaid me in kind. The next year, I changed my ways, deepened the plowing, and tended the soil with care. The grain stalks flourished, and I had my fill for the whole year.'\n\nZhuangzi, hearing of this, said: 'Nowadays, when men cultivate their bodies and order their minds, many resemble what the warden described. They flee from Heaven, depart from their nature, extinguish their emotions, and lose their spirit, all to follow the crowd. Thus, those who recklessly harm their nature give rise to the thorns of desire and aversion. These grow like reeds and rushes, first supporting the body, then seizing the nature, bursting forth in sores and ulcers, erupting without regard for place—festering abscesses, scabies, tumors, inner heat, and the draining of marrow. This is the result.'\n\nWu Ju studied under Lao Cong and said: 'Let me wander throughout the world.'\n\nLao Cong said: 'Enough.'\"\n\nThe world remains as it is. Wu Ju again requested to wander, and Lao Cong asked: \"Where will you begin?\" Wu Ju replied: \"I will begin in Qi.\"\n\nArriving in Qi, he saw a man who had been punished, pushed him forward, and forced him to kneel. Removing his court robes, he covered the man with them and wailed to Heaven, crying: \"Oh, sir! Oh, sir! The world suffers a great blight, and you alone have been the first to encounter it. Day and night, they say: 'Do not steal, do not kill.' Yet only when honor and disgrace are established do people see what ails them; only when wealth is amassed do they see what they contend over. Now, you have established what ails people and amassed what they contend over, exhausting their bodies without respite. Could they not have avoided reaching this point?\n\nThe rulers of old took success as belonging to the people and failure as their own; they took uprightness as belonging to the people and crookedness as their own. Thus, if even one person suffered harm, they would withdraw and blame themselves. Today, it is not so. They conceal their deeds to fool the ignorant, create great difficulties and blame the timid, impose heavy burdens and punish the incapable, and set distant paths to condemn those who cannot reach. When the people exhaust their strength, they resort to deception to sustain themselves. Day by day, deceit multiplies—how can scholars and commoners not follow suit?\n\nWhen strength is insufficient, they feign; when knowledge is lacking, they deceive; when wealth is wanting, they steal. For such thievery, whom can one blame? Lian Boyu lived sixty years and transformed sixty times, never failing to begin with what he deemed right only to end by condemning it as wrong. Who knows whether what he now calls right is not the wrong of fifty-nine years past?\n\nAll things have life, yet none see their roots; all things emerge, yet none see their gates. People all honor the knowledge they possess but do not know that they must rely on what their knowledge does not grasp before they can truly know. Can this not be called a great delusion? Enough, enough! There is nowhere to escape. Is this what is meant by 'so it is,' or is it so?\n\nConfucius asked the Grand Historian Da Qiang, Bo Changqian, and Xi Wei: \"Duke Ling of Wei indulged in wine and revelry, neglecting the governance of his state. He devoted himself to hunting and archery, ignoring his duties among the feudal lords. How then did he come to be called 'Ling'?\" Da Qiang replied: \"It was because of this.\"\n\nBo Changqian said: \"Duke Ling had three wives, with whom he bathed in promiscuous waters. When Historian Qi presented the ritual jades, he struck them with his fists and supported the duke with his arms. Such was his extreme arrogance, yet when he beheld a worthy man, such was his reverence—this is why he was called 'Ling.'\"\n\nXi Wei said: \"When Duke Ling died, divination for burial in the ancestral tomb proved inauspicious, but divination at Shaqiu proved auspicious. After digging several *ren* deep, they found a stone outer coffin. Washing it and examining it, they saw an inscription that read: *'Do not rely on his son; Duke Ling shall seize and bury it.'* Duke Ling’s 'Ling' had long been so—how could these two men understand it?\"\n\nLittle Knowledge asked Grand Duke Diao: \"What is meant by 'the speech of the village and the hamlet'?\"\n\nGrand Duke Diao replied: \"The village and hamlet gather ten surnames and a hundred names to form customs. They unite differences into sameness and disperse sameness into differences. Now, if you point to the hundred parts of a horse and do not obtain the horse, yet the horse stands before you—it is by assembling its hundred parts that you call it a horse. Thus, hills and mountains accumulate the lowly to become high; rivers and streams gather waters to become great; the great man unites all to become impartial. Therefore, what enters from without has a master but is not grasped; what issues from within has a norm but is not resisted. The four seasons have distinct *qi*, yet Heaven does not bestow favor, and so the year is completed. The five offices have distinct duties, yet the ruler does not act for private ends, and so the state is well-governed. The civil and martial great men do not bestow favor, and so their virtue is complete. The myriad things have distinct principles, yet the Dao does not act for private ends, and so it has no name. Having no name, it does nothing; doing nothing, yet there is nothing it does not do. The seasons have endings and beginnings; the world has changes and transformations. Fortune and misfortune flow like a current—where there is resistance, there is also what is fitting. Those who sacrifice themselves do so in different ways—where there is rectitude, there is also error. Compared to a great marsh, all goods pass through; observed in a great mountain, trees and stones share the same ground. This is what is meant by 'the speech of the village and the hamlet.'\"\n\nLittle Knowledge said: \"Then can this be called the Dao?\"\n\nGrand Duke Diao said: \"No. Now, the number of things is not limited to ten thousand, yet we call them 'the ten thousand things' because we use the term for the greatest number to name them. Thus, Heaven and Earth are the greatest of forms; *yin* and *yang* are the greatest of *qi*; the Dao is their impartiality. To name and call them by their greatness is permissible, but once they exist, how can they be compared? If you debate in this way, it is like comparing dogs and horses—how far they fall short!\n\nLittle Knowledge said: \"Within the four directions, within the six conjunctions, from whence do the ten thousand things arise?\"\n\nGrand Duke Diao said: \"*Yin* and *yang* illuminate and cover each other, govern and regulate each other. The four seasons succeed one another, giving birth and bringing death. Desires and aversions, departures and approaches arise in this way; male and female unite in this manner. Safety and danger alternate; fortune and misfortune beget each other. Urgency and slowness rub against each other; gathering and scattering complete things. These are the facts that can be recorded, the essences that can be noted. Following the sequence of their principles, the movements of their bridges and mechanisms, when exhausted they return, when ended they begin—this is what things possess. What words can exhaust, what knowledge can reach, is merely the limit of things. Those who perceive the Dao do not follow what it abandons, do not trace what it initiates—this is where discussion stops.\"\n\nLittle Knowledge said: \"Wei Zhen’s 'nothing doing' and Jiezi’s 'something making'—which of these two doctrines accords with reality, which is biased in its principle?\"\n\nGrand Duke Diao said: \"The crowing of roosters and the barking of dogs are what people know. Even one of great knowledge cannot use words to describe how they transform themselves, nor can they anticipate what they will do. Analyzing this, the essence reaches the unparalleled, the greatness reaches the unbounded. Whether something makes or nothing does, they cannot escape things and thus ultimately consider it a fault. Something making is substantial; nothing doing is empty. Having name and reality is where things reside; having no name and no reality is the emptiness of things. What can be spoken and conceived—speaking of it only makes it more distant. What has not yet been born cannot be hindered; what has already died cannot be obstructed. Life and death are not far apart—principle cannot be seen. Whether something makes or nothing does, doubt borrows from this. Observing its root, its going is endless; seeking its end, its coming is unceasing. Endless and unceasing, words have nothing to say—it shares the principle of things. Whether something makes or nothing does, words are its root, sharing the beginning and end of things. The Dao cannot be possessed; what is possessed cannot be without it. The name 'Dao' is what is borrowed to act. Whether something makes or nothing does, it is but one corner of things—how does it compare to the great square? If words suffice, then speaking all day long exhausts the Dao; if words do not suffice, then speaking all day long exhausts things. The ultimate of the Dao and things—speech and silence cannot bear it. Neither speaking nor silent, discussion reaches its limit.\"\n\n*The Fourth Scroll of the True Scripture of Southern Florescence concludes.*\n\n**Miscellaneous Chapters of the True Scripture of Southern Florescence**\n**Chapter Twenty-Six: External Things**\n\n---\n\n**Textual Variants:**\n1. *Shi* (世) in the *Shide* edition originally read *Huang* (皇).\n2. *Ci* (此) was originally *Bi* (比), emended according to the *Shide* edition.\n3. *Lei* (累) was originally *Lei* (类), emended according to the *Shide* edition.\n4. *Wei* (为) was originally *Wei* (谓), emended according to the *Shide* edition.\n5. *Xing* (行) was originally *Peng* (抨), emended according to the *Shide* edition.\n6. *Yu* (於) was absent in the original, added according to the *Shide* edition.\n7. *Fu* (夫) was originally *Tian* (天), emended according to the *Shide* edition.\n8.

All men desire their ministers to be loyal, yet loyalty does not necessarily earn trust; thus Wu Yun was cast into the river, and Chang Hong died in Shu, his blood stored for three years before turning to jade. All parents desire their children to be filial, yet filial piety does not necessarily bring love; thus Xiaoji grieved, and Zeng Shen mourned.\n\nWhen wood rubs against wood, it ignites; when metal is held to fire, it melts. When yin and yang clash, heaven and earth convulse—thus there is thunder and lightning, fire within water, and the great locust tree burns. When one is beset by double sorrows with no escape, the falling mantis fails to mature, and the heart hangs suspended between heaven and earth, comfort and gloom entangled. As benefit and harm grind against each other, fire blazes fiercely. The multitude burns harmony away; the moon, though constant, cannot withstand the flames. Thus, there is a sudden collapse, and the Dao is exhausted.\n\nZhuangzi was poor, so he went to borrow grain from the Marquis of the River. The Marquis said, \"Very well. When I receive the taxes from my fief, I will lend you three hundred gold pieces—will that suffice?\" Zhuang Zhou flushed with anger and replied, \"On my way here yesterday, I heard a cry from the road. I turned to look and saw a bream in the rut of a chariot wheel. I asked, 'Bream, what are you doing here?' It answered, 'I am a wave-minister of the Eastern Sea. Might you have a dipper of water to keep me alive?' I said, 'Very well. I am about to travel south to persuade the kings of Wu and Yue, and I will divert the waters of the West River to bring you there—will that suffice?' The bream flushed with anger and replied, 'I have lost my accustomed element and have nowhere to go. A dipper of water would keep me alive for now, yet you speak thus—you might as well seek me in a dried-fish shop!'\"\n\nLord Ren made a great hook with a massive black rope, baited it with fifty steers, crouched on Mount Kuaiji, cast his line into the Eastern Sea, and fished day after day for a year without catching anything. Then a great fish took the bait, dragged the hook down, plunged violently, and thrashed its fins, raising white waves like mountains. The sea churned, the sound terrifying spirits for a thousand *li*. Lord Ren caught the fish, butchered it, and salted it. From Zhihe eastward to north of Cangwu, none did not feast on it. Thereafter, those of later generations—petty talents, wandering persuaders—all marveled and spread the tale. Yet those who raise flimsy poles, rush to irrigation ditches, and cling to shallow theories—how could they ever catch a great fish? Those who adorn trivial words to seek high office are as far from great understanding as the sky from the earth. Thus, they have never heard of the customs of the Ren clan, and their inability to navigate the world is equally distant.\n\nConfucians use the *Odes* and *Rites* to rob graves. A great Confucian recited the liturgy: \"Dawn breaks in the east—how goes the affair?\" A lesser Confucian replied, \"The skirt and trousers are not yet untied, but there is a pearl in the mouth.\" The *Odes* indeed say: \"The green, green wheat grows on the hillside. If one does not give in life, why hold onto a pearl in death?\" They seized his temples, rubbed his skull, and with a metal mallet pried open his jaw, carefully parting his cheeks to avoid damaging the pearl in his mouth.\n\nA disciple of Lao Laizi went to gather firewood and encountered Confucius. He returned and reported, \"There is a man over there—his upper body is long, his lower body short, his back hunched, his ears set far back. His gaze seems to survey the four seas—who is he?\" Lao Laizi said, \"That is Qiu.\" He summoned Confucius, who arrived. Lao Laizi said, \"Qiu, cast aside your bodily pride and your cultivated knowledge—then you may become a gentleman.\" Confucius bowed and withdrew, his expression troubled, and asked, \"May I advance in my work?\" Lao Laizi replied, \"One who cannot bear the wounds of a single generation but startles at the calamities of ten thousand ages—is this not stubborn and narrow? Or is it that your plans fall short? To take joy in alarm is a lifelong disgrace. The conduct of the common people advances thus: they draw one another by fame, bind one another by secrecy. Rather than praise Yao and condemn Jie, it is better to forget both and close off what you praise. To turn back is to invite harm; to act is to invite error. The sage hesitates in affairs, achieving success by chance—why should you burden yourself with such pride to the end?\"\n\nDuke Yuan of Song dreamed in the dead of night of a man with disheveled hair peering through the side gate, who said, \"I come from the Zailu Abyss. I was sent by the Clear River as an emissary to the River Lord, but the fisherman Yu Ju caught me.\" The duke awoke and had the dream interpreted. The diviner said, \"This is a sacred turtle.\"\n\nThe duke asked, \"Is there a fisherman named Yu Ju among you?\" His attendants replied, \"There is.\" The duke said, \"Summon Yu Ju to court.\" The next day, Yu Ju appeared at court. The duke asked, \"What did you catch in your fishing?\" Yu Ju answered, \"I caught a white turtle in my net, five feet in circumference.\" The duke said, \"Present this turtle to me.\" When the turtle arrived, the duke wavered twice—first wanting to kill it, then wanting to spare it. His mind unsettled, he divined with it, saying, \"Killing the turtle for divination will bring good fortune.\" So they split the turtle open, drilling seventy-two times without a single miscast.\n\nConfucius said: \"The sacred turtle could appear in a dream to Duke Yuan, yet could not escape Yu Ju’s net; it could know enough to yield seventy-two flawless divinations, yet could not avoid the calamity of having its entrails cut out. Thus, even knowledge has its limitations, and even the numinous has its shortcomings. Though one possesses the highest wisdom, ten thousand men may still outscheme it. Fish do not fear the net but fear the roc. Discard petty knowledge, and great knowledge becomes clear; abandon contrived goodness, and true goodness arises of itself. A newborn babe, without a teacher of stone, can speak—because it dwells among those who can speak.\"\n\nHuizi said to Zhuangzi, \"Your words are useless.\" Zhuangzi replied, \"Only when one knows the useless can one begin to speak of the useful. Heaven and earth are neither narrow nor small, yet what man uses is no more than the space his feet occupy. If, then, one were to dig away all the earth around his feet down to the Yellow Springs, would there still be any use for it?\" Huizi said, \"There would be none.\" Zhuangzi said, \"Then the usefulness of the useless is also clear.\"\n\nZhuangzi said: \"If a man has the ability to wander, can he choose not to wander? If a man cannot wander, can he force himself to do so? Those with drifting, evasive ambitions and reckless, self-destructive conduct—alas, are they fit for the tasks of perfect wisdom and profound virtue? They topple and do not recover, rush headlong and do not look back. Though they may be bound as ruler and minister, it is but a matter of time; when the age changes, they will no longer hold each other in contempt. Thus, the Perfect Man does not linger in his conduct. Those who exalt the past and belittle the present belong to the current of scholars. Yet if one views the present age through the lens of the Xiawei clan, who could avoid being swept along? Only the Perfect Man can wander through the world without bias, follow others without losing himself. He does not learn from teachings, but grasps their intent without clinging to them. Eyes that penetrate are called bright; ears that penetrate are called keen; a nose that penetrates is called discerning; a mouth that penetrates is called savoring; a mind that penetrates is called wise; wisdom that penetrates is called virtue. The Dao does not thrive on obstruction; obstruction leads to choking, and if choking persists, it turns to ruin, from which a multitude of harms arise. All creatures with knowledge depend on breath; if it does not flow smoothly, it is not Heaven’s fault. Heaven bores through them day and night without cease, yet man turns and blocks his own treasure. The womb has its layered gates, the mind has its celestial wanderings. If a room has no empty space, mother and daughter-in-law will quarrel; if the mind has no celestial wandering, the six senses will jostle one another. The great forests and mountains are good for man, yet even the spiritually endowed cannot fully master them. Does virtue overflow into fame, and fame into violence? Do schemes depend on knowledge, and knowledge arise from contention? Does obstruction grow from rigidity, and official affairs culminate in the harmony of the many? When spring rains fall in season, grasses and trees flourish, and the plow begins its work. Half the plants that sprout do so without man knowing why. Stillness can heal illness, slander can rest the aged, and tranquility can halt haste. Yet even so, these are the concerns of the toiling, not the leisurely who have never troubled themselves to inquire. What startles the common people is what the sage takes as his time and realm; what startles the sage is what the spirit man has never troubled to inquire about. What startles the worthy is what the sage has never troubled to inquire about; what startles the gentleman is what the worthy has never troubled to inquire about; what unites the petty man is what the gentleman has never troubled to inquire about.\n\nWhen Yanmen’s father died, he mourned so perfectly that he was appointed an official teacher. His fellow villagers, emulating his grief, died from excessive mourning. Yao offered the world to Xu You, but Xu You fled from it; Tang offered it to Wu Guang, and Wu Guang grew angry. When Ji Ta heard of this, he led his disciples to kneel by the waters of the Ji River. The feudal lords came to console him, and after three years, Shentu Di drowned himself in the river.\n\nThe fish trap exists for the sake of the fish; once the fish is caught, the trap is forgotten. The rabbit snare exists for the sake of the rabbit; once the rabbit is caught, the snare is forgotten. Words exist for the sake of meaning; once the meaning is grasped, the words are forgotten. Where can I find a man who has forgotten words, that I might speak with him?\"\n\n*The Southern Florescence Perfected Scripture, Scroll Five: Miscellaneous Chapters, \"Parables\" Twenty-Seven*\n\nNineteen parts are parables, relying on external voices to expound. Seventeen parts are weighty words. Goblet words emerge daily, harmonizing with the Heavenly Equality. A father does not act as his son’s matchmaker.\n\nA father’s praise is not as good as that of one who is not his father. It is not my fault—it is the fault of others. When something aligns with oneself, one responds; when it does not, one resists. What aligns with oneself is deemed right; what differs is deemed wrong.\n\nThe seventeen weighty words serve to conclude speech, for they are the words of elders. One may be senior in years, yet without the warp and weft of fundamental principles to be deemed truly venerable—this is not true seniority. A person who cannot surpass others lacks the Way of humanity; one who lacks the Way of humanity is called a mere remnant of the past.\n\nGoblet words emerge daily, harmonizing with the Heavenly Equality, flowing and extending to exhaust the years. Without speech, all is equal; equality with speech is not equality, and speech with equality is not equality—thus it is said, \"No speech.\" Speaking without speech, one speaks all one’s life yet has never spoken; not speaking all one’s life, one has never not spoken.\n\nThere is a source from which something may be deemed acceptable, and a source from which it may not; a source from which something is so, and a source from which it is not. How is it so? It is so because it is so. How is it not so? It is not so because it is not so. How is it acceptable? It is acceptable because it is acceptable. How is it unacceptable? It is unacceptable because it is unacceptable. Things inherently have what they affirm, things inherently have what they accept; nothing is not affirmed, nothing is not accepted.\n\nIf not for goblet words emerging daily, harmonizing with the Heavenly Equality, who could endure for long? All things are seeds, succeeding one another in different forms, beginning and end like a ring, with no discernible order—this is called the Heavenly Equilibrium. The Heavenly Equilibrium is the Heavenly Equality.\n\nZhuangzi said to Huizi: \"Confucius lived sixty years and underwent sixty transformations. What he initially affirmed, he later rejected—who knows whether what he now calls right is not what he deemed wrong at fifty-nine?\" Huizi said: \"Confucius diligently applied his will and served his knowledge.\" Zhuangzi said: \"Confucius has renounced such things, yet he has never spoken of it. Confucius said: 'One receives one’s endowment from the great root and revives one’s spirit to live. Singing in accord with the pitch, speaking in accord with the law. Profit and righteousness are set before one, yet likes and dislikes, right and wrong merely submit to people’s mouths. To make people submit with their hearts and not dare to stand in opposition, to settle the world’s settlements—enough, enough! I shall never reach his level.'\"\n\nZengzi took office twice, and his heart transformed twice. He said: \"When I served while my parents were alive, three *fu* of grain brought me joy; later, when I served, three thousand *zhong* did not suffice, and my heart grieved.\" A disciple asked Confucius: \"Can Zeng Shen be said to have no attachment to blame?\" Confucius said: \"He was already attached. How could one without attachment feel sorrow? To him, three *fu* and three thousand *zhong* were like watching sparrows and mosquitoes pass before him.\"\n\nYan Chengzi You said to Shu Guozijing: \"Since I heard your words, after one year I became rustic, after two years I followed, after three years I penetrated, after four years I became one with things, after five years things came to me, after six years spirits entered, after seven years Heaven was accomplished, after eight years I knew neither death nor life, and after nine years I attained the great mystery. Life is action; death is rest—exhort yourself. Because death has a source, while life, being yang, has no source. Is it truly so? Where does it go? Where does it not go? Heaven has its celestial reckoning, earth has its human foundations—where should I seek it? No one knows its end—how can there be no fate? No one knows its beginning—how can there be fate? When there is a response, how can there be no spirits? When there is no response, how can there be spirits?\"\n\nThe multitude of *wangliang* asked the shadow: \"Earlier you were bowing, now you are raising your head; earlier your hair was tied up, now it is loose; earlier you were sitting, now you are standing; earlier you were walking, now you are still—why?\" The shadow said: \"Such trifling questions! Why ask? I act without knowing why. I am like the cicada’s shell, the snake’s slough—seemingly so, yet not so. Fire and sun, I gather with them; yin and night, I alternate with them. Do I depend on them? How much more so for those who depend on others! When they come, I come with them; when they go, I go with them; when they are strong and yang, I am strong and yang with them. What question is there in strong yang?\"\n\nYang Ziju was traveling south to Pei when Lao Dan was journeying west to Qin. They met at the outskirts of Liang, where Laozi sighed to the sky mid-journey and said: \"At first I thought you could be taught, but now you cannot.\" Yang Ziju did not respond. Upon reaching their lodging, he brought water for washing, a towel, and comb, removed his shoes outside the door, advanced on his knees, and said: \"Earlier, your disciple wished to ask you, Master, but you were traveling without speaking, so I did not dare. Now you have spoken—please tell me my fault.\" Laozi said: \"Your haughty and overbearing demeanor—who would wish to dwell with you? The purest white appears sullied; the greatest virtue seems insufficient.\" Yang Ziju’s expression changed abruptly, and he said: \"I respectfully receive your instruction.\" When he first arrived, the innkeeper welcomed him, the master of the house laid out the mat, his wife brought the towel and comb, the guests moved from their seats, and those warming themselves stepped away from the hearth. When he returned, the innkeeper vied with him for his seat.\n\n*The Southern Florescence Perfected Scripture, Scroll Five: Miscellaneous Chapters, \"Yielding the Throne\" Twenty-Eight*\n\nYao offered the empire to Xu You, who refused it. He then offered it to Zizhou Zhipo, who said: \"To make me Son of Heaven would be acceptable. However, I happen to suffer from a deep melancholy, and I am just now treating it—I have no leisure to govern the empire. The empire is the weightiest of things, yet I would not let it harm my life—how much less other things! Only one who does not treat the empire as his own can be entrusted with it.\" Shun offered the empire to Zizhou Zhibo.\n\nZizhou Zhibo said: \"I happen to suffer from a deep melancholy, and I am just now treating it—I have no leisure to govern the empire. Thus the empire is the greatest of vessels, yet one does not exchange life for it. This is how those who embody the Dao differ from the common world.\"\n\nShun offered the empire to Shan Juan. Shan Juan said: \"I stand amidst the cosmos—winter I clothe myself in furs, summer in hempen cloth. In spring I plow and sow, my body sufficient for labor; in autumn I reap and gather, my person sufficient for rest and sustenance. I rise with the sun and work, set with the sun and rest, wandering carefree between heaven and earth, my heart and will content. Why should I desire the empire?\" He sighed, \"Alas, you do not know me.\" And so he refused it. Thereupon he departed and entered the depths of Mount Tan, and none knew his whereabouts.\n\nShun offered the empire to his friend, the farmer of Shihu. The farmer of Shihu said: \"How earnest is the lord’s conduct—a man who preserves his strength! Yet I deem Shun’s virtue still insufficient.\" Thereupon he and his wife, carrying their child on their backs, fled to the sea and never returned.\n\nKing Tai of Zhi dwelled in Deng. The Di tribes attacked him. He offered them furs and silks, but they refused; he offered them dogs and horses, but they refused; he offered them pearls and jade, but they refused. What the Di sought was land. King Tai of Zhi said: \"To dwell with a man’s elder brother and kill his younger brother, to dwell with a man’s father and kill his son—I cannot bear it. Go, all of you, and dwell as you will. Whether one serves as my subject or as a subject of the Di—what difference is there? Moreover, I have heard that one does not harm what nourishes life for the sake of what is used to nourish it.\" Thereupon he took up his staff and departed. The people followed him in droves, and he established a state beneath Mount Qi.\n\nKing Tai of Zhi may be said to have known how to honor life. Those who honor life, though noble and wealthy, do not let what nourishes harm their person; though poor and lowly, they do not let profit burden their form. Yet today’s men who occupy high office and exalted rank all fear losing them. Seeing profit, they lightly risk their lives—how deluded they are!\n\nThe people of Yue assassinated their ruler for three generations. Prince Sou, troubled by this, fled into the cinnabar caves. When Yue was left without a ruler, the people sought Prince Sou but could not find him. They followed him to the cinnabar caves. Prince Sou refused to emerge, so the people smoked him out with mugwort. They bore him away in a jade carriage. Prince Sou grasped the carriage strap and mounted, gazing heavenward and crying: \"Rulership! Rulership! Could you not spare me alone?\" Prince Sou did not hate being a ruler—he hated the calamity of being a ruler. Such a man as Prince Sou may be said not to have harmed his life for the sake of the state. This was precisely what the people of Yue desired in a ruler.\n\nHan and Wei contended over encroached land. Master Hua Zi visited Marquis Zhao of Xi, who wore a troubled expression. Master Hua Zi said: \"Suppose now that the world inscribed a pledge before you, its words saying: 'Grasp it with your left hand, and your right hand will be severed; grasp it with your right hand, and your left hand will be severed. Yet whoever grasps it shall possess the world.' Would you grasp it?\" Marquis Zhao of Xi said: \"I would not grasp it.\" Master Hua Zi said: \"Excellent. From this we see that one’s two arms are weightier than the world, and one’s body is weightier than one’s two arms. The state of Han is far lighter than the world, and what you now contend over is far lighter than Han. Yet you grieve and harm your life, fretting over what you cannot obtain.\" The marquis said: \"Well said! Many have instructed me, but never have I heard such words.\" Master Hua Zi may be said to have known the measure of light and heavy.\n\nThe Lord of Lu heard that Yan He was a man who had attained the Dao. He sent an envoy bearing gifts to precede him. Yan He dwelled in a humble lane, wearing coarse cloth and feeding his own oxen. When the Lord of Lu’s envoy arrived, Yan He personally received him. The envoy asked: \"Is this the home of Yan He?\" Yan He replied: \"This is He’s home.\" The envoy presented the gifts. Yan He said: \"I fear the messenger may have misheard and would incur blame. It would be better to verify.\" The envoy returned, confirmed the matter, and came again to seek him, but Yan He could not be found. Thus one such as Yan He truly despised wealth and honor.\n\nTherefore it is said: The true essence of the Dao is for governing the self; its remnants may be used for ordering the state; its dregs may be used for governing the world. From this we see that the achievements of emperors and kings are but the leftover tasks of sages—never what perfects the person or nourishes life. Yet today’s worldly gentlemen often endanger their bodies and abandon their lives to pursue things—is this not lamentable?\n\nWhenever sages act, they must examine their purpose and their means. Suppose now there were a man here who used a pearl fit for the Duke of Sui to shoot a sparrow a thousand fathoms high—surely the world would laugh at him. Why? Because what he used was weighty, and what he sought was light. Yet life—how is it not weightier than the pearl of the Duke of Sui?\n\nMaster Liezi was poor, his countenance bearing the hue of hunger. A guest mentioned this to Zi Yang of Zheng, saying: \"Lie Yukou is a man of the Dao. That he dwells in your state yet suffers poverty—does this not suggest you do not esteem scholars?\" Zi Yang of Zheng immediately ordered his officials to send him grain. Master Liezi met the envoy, bowed twice, and declined. The envoy departed. Master Liezi entered his home, where his wife gazed at him and beat her breast, saying: \"I have heard that the wife and children of a man of the Dao all enjoy ease and happiness. Now we bear the hue of hunger. The lord deigned to send you food, yet you refused it—is this not fate?\" Master Liezi laughed and said to her: \"The lord does not know me himself. He sent me grain on another’s word, and when he punishes me, it will likewise be on another’s word. This is why I did not accept it.\" In the end, the people indeed rose in rebellion and killed Zi Yang.\n\nKing Zhao of Chu lost his state. The butcher Yue followed in flight after King Zhao.\n\nWhen King Zhao regained his state, he wished to reward those who had followed him, including the butcher Yue. The butcher Yue said: \"When Your Majesty lost the state, I lost my butchery; now that Your Majesty has regained the state, I have regained my butchery. My rank and emolument are already restored—what reward is there to give?\"\n\nThe king said: \"Insist that he accept.\"\n\nThe butcher Yue said: \"When Your Majesty lost the state, it was not my fault, so I dared not suffer punishment; now that Your Majesty has regained the state, it was not my merit, so I dare not claim reward.\"\n\nThe king said: \"Let him be summoned to an audience.\"\n\nThe butcher Yue said: \"By the laws of Chu, only those who have rendered great merit through heavy reward may be granted an audience. My wisdom was insufficient to preserve the state, and my courage insufficient to die in battle against the enemy. When the Wu army entered Ying, I fled from peril and avoided the foe—not that I deliberately followed Your Majesty. Now, if Your Majesty wishes to set aside the law and break the covenant to grant me an audience, this is not what I have heard of under heaven.\"\n\nThe king said to Marshal Zi Jing: \"The butcher Yue dwells in lowly and humble circumstances, yet his exposition of principle is most lofty. You must extend to him the rank of the Three Standards.\"\n\nThe butcher Yue said: \"The rank of the Three Standards—I know it is nobler than my butcher’s stall; the emolument of ten thousand *zhong*—I know it is richer than my butcher’s profit. Yet how could I covet rank and emolument and thereby cause my lord to bear the name of reckless bestowal? I dare not accept. I wish only to return to my butcher’s stall.\" Thus he refused.\n\nYuan Xian dwelt in Lu, in a wattle hut with walls no more than a fathom square, thatched with living grass. The door of woven reeds was incomplete, its hinge made of mulberry wood. Two rooms were windowed with earthen jars, their gaps stopped with coarse cloth. Rain leaked through above, and damp seeped below, yet he sat upright and plucked his zither.\n\nZi Gong arrived in a grand carriage, clad in a purple robe with a white sash, his high-wheeled chariot too wide for the lane. He went to see Yuan Xian.\n\nYuan Xian, wearing a hat of rushes and slippers of untanned leather, leaned on a staff of thornwood to answer the door.\n\nZi Gong said: \"Alas! Master, what ails you?\"\n\nYuan Xian replied: \"I have heard that to lack wealth is called poverty; to study yet be unable to practice is called affliction. Now I am poor, not afflicted.\"\n\nZi Gong retreated, his face flushed with shame.\n\nYuan Xian laughed and said: \"To act for the sake of worldly approval, to befriend for the sake of cliques, to study for others, to teach for oneself, to conceal one’s virtue beneath benevolence and righteousness, to adorn oneself with carriages and horses—these are things I cannot bear to do.\"\n\nZengzi dwelt in Wei, wrapped in a quilted robe without lining, his complexion swollen and sallow, his hands and feet calloused and cracked. For three days he had not kindled a fire, for ten years he had not made new clothes. When he straightened his cap, its strings snapped; when he grasped his lapels, his elbows showed; when he pulled on his shoes, his heels split. Yet he dragged his hem and sang the *Odes of Shang*, his voice filling heaven and earth, resonant as metal and stone.\n\nNo Son of Heaven could make him a subject, no feudal lord could make him a friend. Thus, he who nurtures his will forgets his form; he who nurtures his form forgets profit; he who attains the Dao forgets his mind.\n\nConfucius said to Yan Hui: \"Come, Hui. Your family is poor and your station low—why do you not enter official service?\"\n\nYan Hui replied: \"I do not wish to serve. I have fifty *mu* of fields outside the outer wall, enough to provide millet gruel; ten *mu* within the wall, enough to supply silk and hemp. Playing the zither is enough for my amusement; studying the Master’s Dao is enough for my joy. I do not wish to serve.\"\n\nConfucius’s expression changed, and he said: \"Excellent, Hui’s intent! I have heard that he who knows contentment is not burdened by profit; he who is truly self-possessed does not fear loss; he whose conduct is cultivated within does not chafe at lack of position. I have recited this for a long time, but only now, in you, Hui, do I see it. This is my gain.\"\n\nPrince Mou of Zhongshan said to Zhanzi: \"My body dwells by rivers and seas, yet my heart resides beneath the palace gates of Wei—what is to be done?\"\n\nZhanzi said: \"Value life. If you value life, profit will seem light.\"\n\nPrince Mou of Zhongshan said: \"Though I know this, I cannot overcome myself.\"\n\nZhanzi said: \"If you cannot overcome yourself, then follow your inclination—what harm is there to the spirit? But if you cannot overcome yourself and yet force yourself not to follow, this is called double injury. A doubly injured man belongs not to the long-lived.\"\n\nPrince Mou of Wei, a prince of ten thousand chariots, found it harder to retire to caves and wilds than a commoner. Though he had not yet attained the Dao, he could be said to have grasped its intent.\n\nConfucius was beset between Chen and Cai, going seven days without cooked food, eating only a thin vegetable broth without grain. His complexion was utterly exhausted, yet he plucked his zither and sang in his chamber. Yan Hui was picking greens.\n\nZilu and Zigong said to each other: \"The Master was twice driven from Lu, had his borders pared in Wei, had his tree felled in Song, was reduced to extremity in Shang and Zhou, was besieged between Chen and Cai. Those who would kill the Master bear no guilt; those who would trample him face no prohibition. Yet he plucks his zither and sings, never ceasing his music—is this how a gentleman is without shame?\"\n\nYan Hui had no reply. He entered and told Confucius.\n\nConfucius pushed aside his zither and sighed deeply: \"You and Ci are petty men. Summon them, and I will speak to them.\"\n\nZilu and Zigong entered.\n\nZilu said: \"This may be called utter destitution.\"\nConfucius replied: \"What words are these? The gentleman who is at one with the Dao is called 'at one'; he who is cut off from the Dao is called 'destitute.' Now I embrace the Dao of benevolence and righteousness and encounter the calamities of a disordered age—how can this be called destitution? Thus, though I examine myself thrice daily, I am never cut off from the Dao; facing peril, I do not lose my virtue. When bitter cold arrives and frost and snow descend, it is then I know the flourishing of the pine and cypress. The straits of Chen and Cai—are they not a blessing for me?\"\n\nConfucius then calmly returned to his zither and played and sang, while Zilu, suddenly inspired, grasped his shield and danced. Zigong said: \"I did not know the height of heaven or the depth of earth. Those of old who attained the Dao found joy in adversity and joy in prosperity. What brought them joy was not adversity or prosperity, but the presence of virtue and power. Thus, adversity and prosperity became as the sequence of cold and heat, wind and rain. Therefore, Xu You found delight by the Ying River, and Gong Bo found fulfillment on Mount Qiu. Shun offered the world to his friend, the Northerner Wuze. The Northerner Wuze said: 'How strange the ruler’s conduct! Dwelling amid the fields and furrows, yet wandering at Yao’s gate. Not content with this, he now seeks to sully me with his shameful conduct. I am ashamed to see him.'\"\n\nHe then cast himself into the limpid depths of the pool.\n\nWhen Tang sought to overthrow Jie, he consulted Bian Sui, who said: \"This is not my affair.\" Tang asked: \"Who, then, is suitable?\" He replied: \"I do not know.\" Tang then consulted Wu Guang, who said: \"This is not my affair.\" Tang asked: \"Who, then, is suitable?\" He replied: \"I do not know.\" Tang said: \"What of Yi Yin?\" Wu Guang answered: \"He is strong and enduring, patient of disgrace—I know nothing beyond this.\" Thereupon Tang conspired with Yi Yin to overthrow Jie, and having conquered him, offered the throne to Bian Sui.\n\nBian Sui declined, saying: \"When you plotted against Jie, you consulted me—I must be deemed a traitor. Now that you have vanquished Jie and offer me the throne, I must be deemed greedy. Born in an age of chaos, a man without the Way has twice sought to sully me with his shameful conduct. I cannot bear to hear it again.\" He then cast himself into the Zhou River and drowned.\n\nTang next offered the throne to Wu Guang, saying: \"The wise devise the plan, the valiant execute it, and the humane occupy the throne—this is the Way of old. Why do you not ascend?\" Wu Guang declined, saying: \"To depose one’s superior is not righteous. To kill the people is not humane. Others endure hardship while I enjoy the gain—this is not integrity. I have heard it said: 'One who does not act righteously does not accept its emoluments; in an age without the Way, one does not tread its soil.' How much less would I accept such honor? I cannot bear to remain here long.\"\n\nHe then carried stones on his back and drowned himself in the Lu River.\n\nIn the rise of the Zhou, there were two scholars from Guzhu named Boyi and Shuqi. The two conferred, saying: \"We have heard that in the west there is a man who seems to follow the Way. Let us go and observe.\" Arriving at Qiyang, King Wu heard of them and sent Shu Dan to meet them, making a covenant: \"I shall grant you wealth two ranks higher and appoint you to the first rank of office.\" They slaughtered an animal and buried it as an oath. The two looked at each other and laughed, saying: \"Alas, how strange! This is not what we call the Way. In the days when Shennong ruled the world, sacrifices were made with utmost reverence yet without prayers for blessings. In his dealings with others, he was loyal and trustworthy, governing thoroughly yet without seeking anything. He delighted in governance and took joy in order, never using others’ ruin to build himself up, never exalting himself through others’ lowliness, never profiting from others’ misfortune. Now, the Zhou, seeing the disorder of Yin, hastily seizes power. They scheme above and bribe below, rely on military force to maintain authority, slaughter animals to swear oaths as a sign of trust, flaunt their conduct to please the masses, and resort to killing and warfare to seize profit. This is merely replacing one form of chaos with another. We have heard that the scholars of old, when encountering an age of order, did not shirk their duty, and when facing an age of chaos, did not seek mere survival. Now, the world is in turmoil, and the virtue of Zhou has declined. To align ourselves with Zhou would sully our persons—better to avoid it and preserve our conduct.\" The two then traveled north to Mount Shouyang, where they starved to death.\n\nAs for Boyi and Shuqi, when it came to wealth and honor, if they could be avoided, they would never rely on them. With lofty integrity and unyielding conduct, they alone delighted in their own aspirations, refusing to serve the world. Such was the resolve of these two scholars.\n\n---\n\n*The Southern Florescence Perfected Scripture*, Scroll Five: \"Miscellaneous Chapters,\" Chapter Twenty-Nine: \"Robber Display\"\n\nConfucius was a friend of Liuxia Ji. Liuxia Ji’s younger brother was named Robber Zhi. Robber Zhi led a band of nine thousand followers, rampaging across the land and bullying the feudal lords. They broke into homes, drove off people’s cattle and horses, and abducted their wives and daughters...\n\nRobber Zhi was insatiably greedy, forgetting all kinship—he cared not for parents or brothers, nor did he offer sacrifices to his ancestors. Wherever his band passed, the great states fortified their cities, the small states took refuge in their strongholds, and the common people suffered bitterly.\n\nConfucius said to Liuxia Ji, \"As a father, one must be able to instruct his son; as an elder brother, one must be able to teach his younger brother. If a father cannot guide his son, or an elder brother cannot teach his younger brother, then the bond of father and son, elder and younger brother, is worthless. Now, sir, you are a man of talent in this age, yet your younger brother is Robber Zhi, a scourge upon the world, and you have not been able to teach him. I am secretly ashamed for you. Allow me to go and reason with him on your behalf.\"\n\nLiuxia Ji replied, \"You say that as a father one must instruct his son, and as an elder brother one must teach his younger brother. But if a son does not heed his father’s instruction, or a younger brother does not accept his elder brother’s teaching, what can even your eloquence accomplish? Moreover, Zhi’s nature is such that his mind surges like a spring, his thoughts rush like the whirlwind. His strength is sufficient to resist enemies, his eloquence enough to gloss over wrongs. He delights when his will is followed and rages when it is opposed. He is quick to insult others with words. You must not go.\"\n\nConfucius would not listen. Yan Hui drove the carriage, and Zigong stood at his right as they went to meet Robber Zhi. Robber Zhi was then resting his troops on the southern slope of Mount Tai, mincing human livers to serve as his meal. Confucius alighted from the carriage and stepped forward. Addressing the attendant, he said, \"I am Kong Qiu of Lu. Having heard of the general’s lofty virtue, I respectfully bow twice and request an audience.\"\n\nThe attendant went in to announce him. When Robber Zhi heard this, he flew into a great rage, his eyes blazing like stars, his hair bristling beneath his cap. He said, \"Is this not that cunning and deceitful man Kong Qiu of Lu? Tell him for me: You fabricate words and invent phrases, falsely invoking the names of Kings Wen and Wu. You wear a cap of dead branches and gird yourself with the ribs of a dead ox. You prattle on with your deceptive speeches, eating without plowing, clothing yourself without weaving. You flap your lips and wag your tongue, stirring up right and wrong to delude the rulers of the world, leading the scholars of the age astray from their roots. You falsely perform filial piety and brotherly respect, hoping to gain enfeoffment and riches by luck. Your crimes are vast and your guilt extreme. Flee back at once—or else I shall add your liver to today’s feast.\"\n\nKong Qiu again sent word, saying, \"I have found favor with the Ji family. I wish only to gaze upon your tent-flap.\" The attendant relayed this, and Robber Zhi said, \"Let him come forward.\" Kong Qiu hastened in, stepped back from his mat, and bowed twice to Robber Zhi.\n\nRobber Zhi flew into a rage, stretched out his legs, pressed his sword, glared with blazing eyes, and roared like a nursing tiger: \"Qiu, come forward! If your words please me, you shall live; if they run counter to my heart, you shall die.\"\n\nKong Qiu said, \"I have heard that in all the world there are three virtues: to be born and grow tall, surpassingly fair and peerless, so that young and old, noble and base, all who see you rejoice—this is the highest virtue. To comprehend the bounds of Heaven and Earth, to distinguish all things—this is the middle virtue. To be fierce, resolute, and bold, to gather multitudes and lead armies—this is the lowest virtue. Whoever possesses but one of these virtues is fit to face south and style himself a lord. Now, General, you combine all three: your body stands eight feet and two inches, your face and eyes radiant, your lips like stirred cinnabar, your teeth like aligned cowries, your voice attuned to the Yellow Bell. Yet you are called Robber Zhi—I privately feel shame for you that you do not claim what is yours. If you would heed me, I shall go south to Wu and Yue, north to Qi and Lu, east to Song and Wei, west to Jin and Chu, and have built for you a great city of several hundred *li*, with a town of several hundred thousand households. I shall exalt you as a feudal lord, make a fresh start with the world, disband your troops, rest your soldiers, gather and nurture your brothers, and together offer sacrifice to your ancestors. This is the conduct of a sage and a man of talent, and the world’s deepest wish.\"\n\nRobber Zhi flew into a rage: \"Qiu, come forward! Those who can be swayed by profit or admonished by words are but the dull and vulgar common folk. Now, to be tall and fair, so that all who see you rejoice—this is the legacy of my father and mother. Though you do not praise me, do I not know it myself? Moreover, I have heard that those who flatter others to their faces also slander them behind their backs. Now you tell me of great cities and teeming multitudes—this is to lure me with profit and treat me like a beast to be penned. How could such things last? Of all great cities, none is greater than the world itself. Yao and Shun possessed the world, yet their descendants had not a pin’s place to stand. Tang and Wu became Son of Heaven, yet their posterity perished utterly. Was this not because their profit was too great?\n\nFurthermore, I have heard that in ancient times beasts were many and people few. Thus, people all dwelt in nests to avoid them, gathering acorns by day and roosting in trees by night—hence they were called the people of the Nest Builder. In ancient times, people knew not clothing; in summer they piled firewood, in winter they warmed themselves by it—hence they were called the people who knew how to live. In the age of Shen Nong, people lived at ease, rising and moving about freely. They knew their mothers but not their fathers, dwelt with elk and deer, plowed to eat, wove to clothe themselves, and harbored no thought of harming one another. This was the height of perfect virtue. Yet the Yellow Emperor could not sustain this virtue: he fought Chi You on the plains of Zhuolu, and blood flowed for a hundred *li*. Yao and Shun arose and established a host of ministers; Tang exiled his lord, King Wu slew Zhou. From that time onward, the strong oppressed the weak, the many bullied the few. From Tang and Wu to the present, all have been men of disorder.\n\nNow you cultivate the Way of Wen and Wu, grasp the world’s eloquence, and teach posterity. You wear fine robes with narrow sashes, speak in affected tones, and act with false conduct to delude the world’s rulers, seeking thereby wealth and honor. There is no greater thief than you. Why does the world not call you Thief Qiu, instead of calling me Robber Zhi? You beguiled Zilu with sweet words to make him follow you, had him remove his martial cap and lay aside his long sword to receive your teachings. The world all says that Kong Qiu can quell violence and forbid wrongdoing. Yet in the end, Zilu sought to kill the lord of Wei and failed, and his body was impaled above the eastern gate of Wei. This was because your teaching was insufficient. Do you call yourself a man of talent and a sage? Then why were you twice driven from Lu, your traces erased in Wei, impoverished in Qi, besieged in Chen and Cai, and left with no place in the world? You taught Zilu to meet this disaster, leaving him neither honor above nor humanity below. Is your Way truly worthy of esteem?\n\nOf all those the world exalts, none is greater than the Yellow Emperor, yet even he could not preserve his virtue intact. He fought on the plains of Zhuolu, and blood flowed for a hundred *li*. Yao was unkind, Shun was unfilial, Yu was crippled on one side, Tang exiled his lord, King Wu attacked Zhou, King Wen was imprisoned at Youli. These six men are those the world exalts, yet when one examines them, all were deluded by profit and forced their true natures to rebel against their inborn dispositions. Their conduct was most shameful indeed.\n\nOf those the world calls worthy men, none surpass Boyi and Shuqi. Boyi and Shuqi renounced the lordship of Guzhu and starved to death on Mount Shouyang, their flesh and bones left unburied. Bao Jiao adorned his conduct to condemn the age and embraced a tree to die. Shentu Di remonstrated but was not heeded, carried a stone and cast himself into the river, where he was eaten by fish and turtles. Jie Zitui was most loyal: he cut flesh from his own thigh to feed Duke Wen. Later, Duke Wen betrayed him, and in anger he departed, embraced a tree, and burned to death. Weisheng made a tryst with a woman beneath a bridge. When she did not come and the waters rose, he would not leave, embraced the bridge pillar, and drowned. These six men were no different from stray dogs, drifting swine, or beggars clutching gourds. All pursued fame and scorned death, heedless of their roots, nurturing life, and preserving their inborn nature.\n\nOf those the world calls loyal ministers, none surpass Prince Bigan and Wu Zixu. Zixu was drowned in the river, Bigan was disemboweled—these two are called loyal ministers, yet in the end they were laughed at by the world. From the highest perspective, down to Zixu and Bigan, none are worthy of esteem.\"\n\nConfucius said to me: \"If you speak to me of ghostly matters, I cannot know them; but if you speak to me of human affairs, they do not exceed these—all are things I have heard and understood. Now I shall tell you of human nature: the eyes desire to see beauty, the ears to hear sound, the mouth to savor flavors, and the will and qi seek fulfillment. A man may live a long life of a hundred years, a middling life of eighty, or a short life of sixty; yet if we subtract days lost to illness, emaciation, mourning, death, and sorrow, the days in which he opens his mouth to laugh number no more than four or five in a month. Heaven and earth are without end, but man’s death comes at a fixed time. To grasp a vessel of fixed duration and entrust it to the boundless void is to pass like a swift steed galloping past a crack in the wall—suddenly, in an instant. Those who cannot delight their will and nurture their lifespan are not masters of the Dao.\n\nAll that I have said, you must cast aside. Hurry, leave, and return home—do not speak of it again. Your Way is wild and erratic, full of deceit, cunning, and falsity—it cannot preserve the true. What is there to discuss?\"\n\nConfucius bowed twice, then hastened away. He exited the gate, mounted his carriage, and three times lost hold of the reins. His eyes were dazed and sightless, his complexion ashen like the dead. He leaned against the crossbar, head bowed, unable to catch his breath. Upon returning to the eastern gate of Lu, he chanced upon Liuxia Ji.\n\nLiuxia Ji said: \"I have not seen you for several days, and your carriage and horses bear signs of travel. Might you have gone to see Jue?\"\n\nConfucius looked up to the heavens and sighed: \"Indeed.\"\n\nLiuxia Ji said: \"Did he perhaps go against your intentions as before?\"\n\nConfucius said: \"Indeed. I was like a man without illness who moxibusts himself—running swiftly to measure a tiger’s head or braid its whiskers, nearly escaping not from the tiger’s jaws!\"\n\nZizhang asked Mang Goude: \"Why do you not act?\"\n\n\"Without action, there is no trust; without trust, no responsibility; without responsibility, no benefit. Thus, when one observes reputation and calculates profit, righteousness is truly at stake. If one abandons fame and gain and turns inward to the heart, then the scholar’s conduct cannot be neglected for even a day.\"\n\nMang Goude said: \"The shameless grow rich, and the deceitful gain prominence. The greatest of fame and profit lie in shamelessness and deceit. Thus, when one observes reputation and calculates profit, trust is truly at stake. If one abandons fame and gain and turns inward to the heart, then the scholar’s conduct embraces the celestial.\"\n\nZizhang said: \"In ancient times, Jie and Zhou were honored as Sons of Heaven and possessed all under heaven. Yet if today you tell a man of Zang or Ju, 'Your conduct is like Jie or Zhou,' he will flush with anger and feel indignant—such is the contempt of petty men. Confucius and Mo Di were impoverished commoners, yet if today you tell a minister, 'Your conduct is like Confucius or Mo Di,' he will change his expression and protest his inadequacy—such is the true esteem of the scholar. Thus, to be a Son of Heaven does not necessarily confer nobility, nor does poverty as a commoner necessarily confer baseness. The distinction between noble and base lies in the beauty or ugliness of one’s conduct.\"\n\nMang Goude said: \"Petty thieves are imprisoned, but great thieves become lords; and at the gates of lords, righteous scholars take refuge. In the past, Duke Huan of Qi, Xiaobai, killed his brother and took his sister-in-law, yet Guan Zhong served as his minister. Tian Chengzi murdered his lord and usurped the state, yet Confucius accepted his gifts. In speech, they are condemned; in action, they are deferred to—is this not a contradiction in the heart, a perversion? Thus, the Book says: 'Who is base? Who is noble? The successful are heads, the unsuccessful are tails.'\n\nZizhang said: \"If you do not act, then kinship and affection will lack order, noble and base will lack righteousness, and elder and younger will lack sequence. How then can the Five Constants and Six Positions be distinguished?\"\n\nMang Goude said: \"Yao killed his eldest son, Shun exiled his younger brother—where is the order in kinship? Tang exiled Jie, King Wu killed Zhou—where is the righteousness in noble and base? King Ji was the rightful heir, yet the Duke of Zhou killed his brother—where is the sequence in elder and younger? The Confucians speak falsely, the Mohists preach universal love—how can the Five Constants and Six Positions be distinguished?\n\nMoreover, you rectify for fame, I rectify for profit. The reality of fame and profit does not accord with principle, nor does it reflect the Dao. Daily I debate with you before Wu Yue, saying: 'The petty man dies for wealth, the gentleman dies for fame.' Though their emotions and natures differ in what they change and alter, when it comes to abandoning what they do for what they do not do, they are the same. Thus it is said: Do not be a petty man, turn back and die for the celestial. Do not be a gentleman, follow the principle of Heaven. Whether crooked or straight, align with the celestial pole; face the four directions and ebb and flow with the times. Whether right or wrong, grasp the round mechanism, stand alone in intent, and wander with the Dao. Do not act for gain, do not establish righteousness, lest you lose what you seek. Do not rush toward wealth, do not die for success, lest you abandon the celestial.\n\nBigan was disemboweled, Wu Zixu had his eyes gouged out—such are the calamities of loyalty. Zhigong testified against his father, Weisheng drowned—such are the perils of trust. Master Bao stood firm, Shenzi did not defend himself—such are the harms of integrity. Confucius did not see his mother, Kuangzi did not see his father—such are the failures of righteousness. These are the traditions of the upper ages and the talk of later generations. For scholars who rectify their words and verify their conduct, they bring upon themselves disaster and calamity.\"\n\nWuzu asked Zhihe: \"There has never been a man who did not pursue fame and profit. The wealthy attract followers; followers defer to them; deference brings esteem. To be deferred to and esteemed is the way to long life, bodily ease, and joyful contentment. Why do you alone have no such intention? Is your knowledge insufficient? Or do you know but lack the strength to act? Or do you cling to some other principle?\"\n\nZhihe said: \"Now, those who consider themselves contemporaries and neighbors regard those who transcend custom and surpass the world as...\"\n\nThis is to be without a guiding principle, by which one surveys the ages of past and present and distinguishes right from wrong, yet still drifts with the world’s transformations. They cast aside what is most weighty and abandon what is most honorable, all for the sake of their own pursuits. How far this is from the Way of long life, bodily ease, and joyful contentment! The pain of sorrowful illness and the peace of serene delight are not reflected in the body; the fear of constant dread and the joy of heartfelt delight are not reflected in the mind. They know how to act but not why they act—thus, though they are honored as Son of Heaven and possess all under Heaven, they cannot escape calamity.\"\n\nWuzu said: \"Wealth brings every advantage to man. It exhausts beauty and exhausts power, reaching what even the most perfect cannot attain and what the worthiest cannot match. It harnesses the strength and courage of the bold to create might, wields the wisdom and schemes of others to achieve clarity, and adopts the virtue of others to appear worthy and good. Without even holding office, one commands reverence like a sovereign or father. Moreover, the pleasures of sound, color, flavor, and power—these delight the heart without need of learning, and the body finds comfort in them without need of imitation. Desires and aversions, what to seek and what to avoid, are innate and require no teacher: this is the nature of man. Though all under Heaven may condemn them, who can refuse them?\"\n\nZhihe said: \"The actions of the wise are thus: they move in accord with the people, never transgressing proper measure. Therefore, they are content and do not contend, and for no purpose do they seek. Those who lack seek, and though they contend in all directions, they do not consider themselves greedy. Those who have surplus decline, casting aside all under Heaven without considering themselves modest. The true nature of modesty and greed is not imposed from without but lies in observing proper measure. Though one holds the position of Son of Heaven, one does not use nobility to intimidate others; though one possesses all under Heaven, one does not use wealth to toy with others. Calculating the harm and considering the consequences, one sees that it harms one’s nature, and so one declines and does not accept—not to seek fame and reputation. Yao and Shun ruled as emperors and brought harmony, not to benevolently govern all under Heaven, but to avoid letting beauty harm their lives. Shanjuan and Xu You were offered the throne but refused, not out of empty humility, but to avoid letting affairs harm themselves. All of them pursued what benefited them and declined what harmed them. Though all under Heaven called them worthy, they could have accepted, but they did not do so for the sake of fame and reputation.\"\n\nWuzu said: \"If one must cling to reputation, endure bodily hardship, reject sweetness, and restrict nourishment to preserve life, then one is no better than a long-suffering invalid who lingers on without dying.\"\n\nZhihe said: \"Equilibrium brings fortune, while excess brings harm—this is true of all things, and wealth is the most extreme case. Now, the rich man’s ears are filled with the sounds of bells, drums, pipes, and flutes; his mouth savors the flavors of fine meats and sweet wines, distracting his mind and causing him to neglect his affairs—this may be called disorder. Engulfed in surging qi, he moves as if burdened with a heavy load while climbing—this may be called suffering. Greedy for wealth, he takes comfort in it; greedy for power, he exhausts himself. At rest, he is drowned in it; in motion, he is overwhelmed by it—this may be called illness. Driven by the desire for wealth and the pursuit of profit, he is filled to the ears yet does not know to avoid it, pressing forward without cease—this may be called disgrace. Wealth accumulates without use; he clings to it without release, his heart filled with sorrow and bitterness, endlessly seeking more—this may be called worry. Within, he suspects the treachery of those who flatter and beg; without, he fears the harm of bandits and thieves. He surrounds himself with high towers and deep moats and dares not travel alone—this may be called fear. These six are the greatest harms under Heaven, yet all are forgotten and unexamined. When calamity strikes, one seeks to exhaust one’s nature and deplete one’s wealth, hoping in vain to return to a single day of carefree ease. Thus, when one gazes upon fame, it is not seen; when one seeks profit, it is not obtained. Yet one wearies the mind and wears out the body in contention for these—is this not delusion?\"\n\n---\n\n*The Southern Florescence: The True Classic, Scroll Five, Miscellaneous Chapters – \"Discourse on Swords\"*\n\nLong ago, King Wen of Zhao delighted in swords. Over three thousand swordsmen gathered as retainers at his gates, clashing before him day and night. Each year, more than a hundred died or were wounded, yet his passion never waned. After three years of this, the state declined, and the feudal lords plotted against it. The crown prince, Li, grew anxious and offered a reward to his attendants: \"Whoever can persuade the king to abandon his fondness for swordsmen shall receive a thousand gold pieces.\" His attendants said, \"Zhuangzi is the one who can do this.\"\n\nThe crown prince then sent messengers bearing a thousand gold pieces to present to Zhuangzi. Zhuangzi refused the gift but accompanied the messengers to see the crown prince. He asked, \"What instruction does the crown prince have for me, that you offer me a thousand gold pieces?\" The crown prince replied, \"I have heard that you, Master, are enlightened and sagely. I humbly present this thousand gold as a gift for your attendants. If you refuse, how dare I speak further?\" Zhuangzi said, \"I have heard that the crown prince wishes to employ me to put an end to the king’s fondness for swords. If I persuade the king but fail to align with his wishes, or if I do not meet the crown prince’s expectations, I will face execution. How then could I concern myself with gold? If I persuade the king and meet the crown prince’s expectations, what in the state of Zhao could I not obtain?\"\n\nThe crown prince said, \"Indeed. My father, the king, sees only swordsmen.\" Zhuangzi replied, \"Very well. I am skilled in the use of the sword.\" The crown prince said, \"But the swordsmen my father sees all have unkempt hair, bristling sideburns, and drooping caps with coarse tassels. Their robes are short in the back, their eyes glower, and their speech is harsh. The king delights in them. If you, Master, appear before him in scholar’s robes, the matter will surely go awry.\" Zhuangzi said, \"I request to prepare a swordsman’s attire.\" After three days of preparing the attire, he met with the crown prince, who then accompanied him to see the king. The king drew his unsheathed sword and waited.\n\nZhuangzi entered the palace gates without haste and did not bow upon seeing the king. The king said, \"What instruction do you bring me, that the crown prince has gone to such lengths?\" Zhuangzi replied, \"I have heard that Your Majesty delights in swords, and so I have come to present my swordsmanship.\" The king asked, \"What can your sword do?\" Zhuangzi said, \"My sword can cut down one man every ten paces, and its edge never falters for a thousand li.\"\n\nThe king was greatly pleased and said, \"You would be unmatched in all under Heaven!\" Zhuangzi replied, \"As for the sword, one displays emptiness, offers advantage, follows with the strike, and arrives first. I wish to demonstrate this.\" The king said, \"Master, rest at your lodging and await my command. I shall arrange a contest and summon you.\" The king then assembled swordsmen for seven days; over sixty were killed or wounded, and five or six remained. These were ordered to present their swords at the palace steps, and Zhuangzi was summoned. The king said, \"Today I shall have the swordsmen engage in a trial of skill.\" Zhuangzi said, \"I have long awaited this.\" The king asked, \"What length of weapon does the Master wield?\" Zhuangzi replied, \"Any I am given will suffice. Yet I possess three swords—only Your Majesty may choose which to employ. Permit me first to describe them, then to demonstrate.\"\n\nThe king said, \"I wish to hear of the three swords.\"\nZhuangzi said, \"There is the Sword of the Son of Heaven, the Sword of the Feudal Lords, and the Sword of the Commoner.\"\n\nThe king asked, \"What is the Sword of the Son of Heaven like?\"\nZhuangzi replied, \"The Sword of the Son of Heaven has its edge in Yanxi and Shicheng, its guard in Mount Tai of Qi, its spine in Jin and Wei, its base in Zhou and Song, and its blade in Han and Wei. It is wrapped in the Four Barbarians, enveloped by the Four Seasons, encircled by the Bohai Sea, and girded by Mount Chang. It is governed by the Five Phases, judged by punishment and virtue, opened by yin and yang, sustained by spring and summer, and wielded in autumn and winter.\"\n\nThis sword, when thrust forward, knows no rival; when raised, nothing stands above it; when pressed downward, nothing lies beneath it; when swung, nothing flanks it. Above, it cleaves the floating clouds; below, it severs the earth’s foundations. Once this sword is wielded, it rectifies the feudal lords, and all under heaven submits. Such is the Sword of the Son of Heaven.\n\nKing Wen, bewildered, lost his composure and asked, \"What of the Sword of the Feudal Lords?\"\nZhuangzi replied, \"The Sword of the Feudal Lords has its edge in the wise and brave, its guard in the pure and incorrupt, its spine in the worthy and good, its base in the loyal and victorious, and its blade in the heroic and outstanding. This sword, when thrust forward, likewise knows no rival; when raised, nothing stands above it; when pressed downward, nothing lies beneath it; when swung, nothing flanks it. Above, it models the round heavens to follow the Three Luminaries; below, it models the square earth to follow the Four Seasons; within, it discerns the people’s will to pacify the four quarters. Once this sword is wielded, it strikes like thunder, and within the four borders, none fail to submit and heed their lord’s command. Such is the Sword of the Feudal Lords.\"\n\nThe king asked, \"What of the Sword of the Commoner?\"\nZhuangzi replied, \"The Sword of the Commoner is wielded by those with disheveled hair, unkempt sideburns, drooping caps, frayed tassels, short-backed robes, glaring eyes, and contentious speech. They clash before one another, severing necks above and piercing livers and lungs below. This sword of the commoner differs not from fighting cocks—once their lives are spent, they serve no purpose in the affairs of state. Now, Your Majesty, possessing the station of the Son of Heaven, yet favoring the sword of the commoner—I humbly deem this unworthy of you.\"\n\nThe king then led Zhuangzi up to the hall. The royal steward presented the feast, and the king circled the table thrice. Zhuangzi said, \"Your Majesty, be seated and compose yourself. The matter of the swords has been presented in full.\"\n\nThereupon, King Wen did not leave his palace for three months, and the swordsmen all perished in their quarters.\n\n---\n\nFrom *The True Classic of Southern Florescence*, Scroll Five, \"Miscellaneous Chapters: The Fisherman, Thirty-One\"\n\nConfucius wandered through the forest of black curtains and rested upon the secluded altar. His disciples read aloud while Confucius strummed the zither and sang. Before the melody was half-finished, an old fisherman descended from his boat and approached. His temples and brows were white, his hair unbound, his sleeves tattered. He strode up from the marsh, halted at the shore, left hand resting on his knee, right hand cradling his chin, and listened. When the song ended, he beckoned to Zilu and Zigong, who both stepped forward.\n\nThe stranger pointed at Confucius and asked, \"What is that man doing?\"\nZilu replied, \"He is a gentleman of Lu.\"\nThe stranger asked of his lineage.\nZilu answered, \"The lineage of Kong.\"\nThe stranger asked, \"And what does this Kong lineage practice?\"\nZilu did not respond, but Zigong answered, \"The Kong lineage cultivates loyalty and trust in their nature, embodies benevolence and righteousness in their conduct, refines ritual and music, and selects human relationships. Above, they serve the rulers of the age with loyalty; below, they transform the common people, seeking to benefit all under heaven. Such is the practice of the Kong lineage.\"\n\nThe stranger asked again, \"Is he a lord with lands?\"\nZigong said, \"No.\"\n\"A counselor to kings and marquises?\"\nZigong said, \"No.\"\nThe stranger laughed and turned away, saying as he walked, \"Benevolent, to be sure—but I fear he will not escape harm to himself. He wearies his mind and wears his body, endangering his true nature. Alas, how far he has strayed from the Dao!\"\n\nZigong returned and reported this to Confucius. Confucius pushed aside his zither and rose, saying, \"Is he a sage?\" He descended to seek the man, reaching the marsh’s edge just as the fisherman was about to pole his boat away. Glancing back, he saw Confucius, turned toward him, and stood still. Confucius retreated, bowed twice, and stepped forward.\n\nThe stranger asked, \"What do you seek?\"\nConfucius replied, \"Earlier, sir, you left with words unfinished. I, Qiu, am unworthy and did not grasp their meaning. I humbly awaited in your wake, hoping to hear even the sound of your cough or spit to complete my instruction.\"\n\nThe stranger said, \"Ah! How earnest is your love of learning!\"\nConfucius bowed twice and rose, saying, \"From my youth I have cultivated learning, and now, at sixty-nine, I have yet to hear the ultimate teaching. I dare not but remain open-hearted.\"\n\nThe stranger said, \"Like attracts like, and like sounds resonate—this is the principle of heaven. Allow me to expound what I possess and apply it to your concerns. What you concern yourself with are human affairs. The Son of Heaven, feudal lords, great officers, and commoners—when these four are properly aligned, governance is at its finest. If these four abandon their stations, no greater disorder exists. When offices fulfill their duties and people attend to their tasks, there is no encroachment. Thus:\n\nFor the commoner, the worries are: fields lying fallow, homes exposed to the elements, clothing and food insufficient, taxes unpaid, discord between wife and concubine, and disorder between elders and juniors.\n\nFor the great officer, the worries are: incompetence in office, official duties neglected, conduct impure, subordinates idle, achievements unrecognized, and ranks and emoluments unstable.\n\nFor the feudal lord, the worries are: no loyal ministers in court, the state in chaos, craftsmen lacking skill, tribute unrefined, falling behind in spring and autumn ceremonies, and disobeying the Son of Heaven.\n\nFor the Son of Heaven’s ministers, the worries are: yin and yang out of harmony, cold and heat untimely, harming the myriad things; feudal lords violent and disorderly, seizing and attacking one another, ravaging the people; ritual and music unrestrained, resources exhausted, human relationships unadorned, and the hundred clans licentious.\n\nNow, you, sir, possess neither the authority of a lord or minister above nor the office of a great officer below, yet you presume to refine ritual and music, select human relationships, and transform the common people. Is this not overreaching?\n\nMoreover, people have eight flaws, and affairs have four perils—these cannot be left unexamined.\n\nTo attend to what is not one’s affair is called *meddling*;\nTo advance where none heed is called *obsequiousness*;\nTo guide speech by others’ expectations is called *flattery*;\nTo speak without discerning right or wrong is called *sycophancy*;\nTo delight in speaking of others’ faults is called *slander*;\nTo sever friendships and divide kin is called *treachery*;\nTo praise falsely and deceive to harm others is called *connivance*;\nTo accept both good and bad without distinction, flattering both sides to advance one’s desires, is called *perfidy*.\"\n\nThese eight flaws disrupt others outwardly and harm oneself inwardly—noble persons do not befriend such men, and enlightened rulers do not employ them.\n\nAs for the four perils:\nTo delight in managing great affairs, altering and overturning constants in pursuit of merit and fame is called *presumption*;\nTo monopolize knowledge, arrogate authority, and encroach upon others through self-assertion is called *greed*;\nTo persist in error despite correction, and grow more obstinate when admonished, is called *obduracy*;\nTo approve only what aligns with oneself, and dismiss even the good if it differs, is called *arrogance*.\nThese are the four perils.\n\nOnly by shedding the eight flaws and avoiding the four perils can one begin to receive instruction.\n\nConfucius sighed deeply, bowed twice, and rose, saying: \"I was twice exiled from Lu, had my lands pared away in Wei, was felled like a tree in Song, and besieged between Chen and Cai. I know not what faults I committed to incur these four slanders—why was this?\"\n\nThe guest’s expression turned somber as he replied: \"How deeply you resist awakening! There was a man who feared his shadow and loathed his footprints, and so ran to escape them. The more he lifted his feet, the more prints appeared; the faster he ran, the closer his shadow clung. Believing himself still too slow, he ran without cease until he collapsed and died. He did not know that standing in shade would still his shadow, or that stillness would erase his prints—how utterly foolish!\n\nYou scrutinize the questions of benevolence and righteousness, examine the boundaries of sameness and difference, observe the shifts of activity and stillness, adjust the measures of giving and receiving, order the passions of like and dislike, and harmonize the rhythms of joy and anger—yet you nearly escape none of this. If you diligently cultivate yourself, guard your authenticity, and return things to others, you will be free from entanglements. To neglect self-cultivation while seeking from others is to miss the mark entirely.\"\n\nConfucius sighed again and asked: \"May I ask what is meant by *authenticity*?\"\n\nThe guest replied: \"Authenticity is the utmost of sincerity. Without sincerity, one cannot move others. Thus, forced weeping, though sorrowful, lacks grief; forced anger, though stern, lacks awe; forced affection, though smiling, lacks harmony. True grief is silent yet mournful; true anger is unexpressed yet awe-inspiring; true affection is unsmiling yet harmonious. When authenticity resides within, the spirit manifests without—this is why authenticity is prized.\n\nApplied to human affairs:\nIn serving parents, it is *filial devotion*;\nIn serving rulers, it is *loyal integrity*;\nIn drinking, it is *joy*;\nIn mourning, it is *grief*.\nLoyal integrity is measured by merit; drinking, by joy; mourning, by grief; serving parents, by suitability. When merit is perfected, no single path is prescribed.\n\nServing parents with suitability requires no discussion of means;\nDrinking with joy requires no selection of vessels;\nMourning with grief requires no inquiry into ritual.\nRitual is what世俗 constructs; authenticity is what one receives from Heaven—natural and unalterable. Thus, the sage models Heaven and values authenticity, unbound by convention. The foolish do the opposite: unable to model Heaven, they fret over others, ignorant of authenticity’s worth, drifting with俗 and thus never sufficient. Alas, you were steeped in human artifice early on and only now hear of the Great Dao!\"\n\nConfucius bowed twice and rose again: \"Today I have met you as if by Heaven’s grace. You deign to instruct me, though I am no better than a servant. May I ask where you dwell, that I might follow and complete my study of the Great Dao?\"\n\nThe guest said: \"I have heard that those who can journey with you may be led to the subtleties of the Dao; those who cannot, do not grasp the Dao—beware of sharing it with them, lest you bring harm upon yourself. Strive on! I leave you now, I leave you now.\" With that, he poled his boat away, vanishing among the green reeds.\n\nYan Yuan turned the carriage, and Zilu handed Confucius the reins, but Confucius did not look back. He waited until the water’s ripples stilled and no sound of oars could be heard before daring to board. Zilu stepped beside the carriage and asked: \"I have long served you, yet never seen you meet another with such reverence. Kings of ten thousand chariots and lords of a thousand have met you without failing to observe proper courtesy, yet you still bore a haughty air. Now this old fisherman, leaning on his pole, stood upright before you, and you bent at the waist like a chiming stone, bowing repeatedly in response—was this not excessive? Your disciples all find it strange. How did the fisherman deserve such deference?\"\n\nConfucius leaned on the crossbar and sighed: \"How difficult you are to transform, Zilu! You have been steeped in ritual and righteousness for so long, yet your coarse and vulgar heart remains. Come closer, and I will tell you: To meet an elder without respect is a breach of ritual; to meet a worthy without reverence is a lack of benevolence. If he were not a perfected person, he could not humble himself before others. Without humbling oneself with precision, one cannot attain authenticity—and thus risks lasting harm to the self. Alas, nothing is more disastrous to a person than a lack of benevolence, and you alone cling to it!\n\nMoreover, the Dao is the path by which all things proceed. Creatures that lose it die; those that attain it live. In affairs, opposing it brings failure; following it brings success. Thus, wherever the Dao resides, the sage reveres it. This old fisherman possesses the Dao—how could I not revere him?\"\n\nHe replied: \"I once dined at ten millet-porridge stalls, and at five of them, the porridge was served first.\"\n\nBerwyn Puren said: \"If that is so, then why are you alarmed?\"\n\nHe answered: \"When inner sincerity is unresolved, outward demeanor radiates an imposing light, which overawes others’ hearts, making them disregard age and rank while magnifying their concerns. Those porridge-sellers merely peddle their wares for profit—meager gains, trifling influence—and yet even they behave so. How much more so, then, for a ruler of ten thousand chariots? If I exhaust myself for the state and expend all my knowledge on affairs, he will entrust me with tasks and demand results from me. That is why I am alarmed.\"\n\nBerwyn Puren said: \"Excellent observation! If you conduct yourself thus, others will safeguard you.\"\n\nShortly after, he went to visit, only to find the courtyard filled with shoes outside the door. Berwyn Puren stood facing north, leaning on his staff and pressing it against his chin. After standing for a while, he departed without a word. The attendant informed Liezi, who rushed out in haste, shoes in hand, and caught up at the gate, saying: \"Master, since you have come, will you not prescribe a remedy?\"\n\nHe replied: \"Enough. I already told you that others would safeguard you—and indeed, they do. It is not that you can make others protect you, but that you cannot prevent them from doing so. Why then do you seek to impress or display your uniqueness? If you must stir emotions and disrupt your fundamental nature, it is meaningless. Those who accompany you in your wanderings will not warn you: their petty words are all poison. Unaware and unenlightened, how can they scrutinize one another? The cunning toil, the wise fret, the incapable seek nothing. Eat your fill and roam freely, drifting like an untethered boat, empty and unbound in your wanderings.\"\n\nIn Zheng, there was a man named Huan who groaned and wailed in the land of Qiu Shi. After three years, Huan became a Confucian scholar. His virtue moistened the land for nine *li*, and his beneficence extended to three clans, even converting his younger brother to Mohism. The Confucians and Mohists debated, and their father sided with Mo Di. Ten years later, Huan took his own life. His father dreamed of him, saying: \"It was I who made your son a Mohist. Why did you not examine his true nature? Once he became the fruit of an autumn paulownia, what could be done?\"\n\nThe Creator’s retribution does not punish the person but the Heaven within the person. Thus, it is Heaven that enables them. Those who deem themselves exceptional, distinct from others, and despise their kin are like the people of Qi who fought over well-water. Hence, it is said: \"In this age, all are like Huan.\" From this, those with virtue remain unaware—how much more so those who embody the Dao?\n\nIn ancient times, this was called \"the punishment of fleeing from Heaven.\" The sage finds peace in what is truly peaceful and does not find peace in what is not; the multitude finds peace in what is not peaceful and does not find peace in what is. Zhuangzi said: \"To know the Dao is easy; to refrain from speaking of it is difficult. To know and not speak—this is how one aligns with Heaven. To know and speak—this is how one aligns with man.\" The people of old followed Heaven and not man.\n\nZhu Hongman studied the art of dragon-slaying from Zhi Liyi, exhausting a thousand gold pieces from his family. After three years, his skill was perfected, yet there was no use for his craft. The sage takes the inevitable as not inevitable, thus having no need for weapons; the multitude takes the not inevitable as inevitable, thus possessing many weapons. Yielding to weapons, their actions become demands. Weapons, once relied upon, bring ruin.\n\nThe petty man’s knowledge does not extend beyond bundled firewood and bamboo slips. He exhausts his spirit in trivial pursuits, yet seeks to guide and transform all things, to embody the Great Unity and the formless void. Such a one is deluded by the cosmos, burdened by form, and unaware of the Great Beginning. The perfected person, however, returns their spirit to the beginningless and delights in the realm of Nothing Whatever. Water flows without form, issuing forth into the Great Purity.\n\nAlas! You take wisdom to reside in the finest details yet do not know the Great Peace.\n\nThere was a man of Song named Cao Shang who was sent by the King of Song as an envoy to Qin. On his departure, he received several carriages; the King of Qin was pleased with him and added a hundred more. Returning to Song, he saw Zhuangzi and said: \"To dwell in a cramped lane, impoverished and weaving sandals, with a withered neck and sallow face—this is what I was unskilled at. To awaken the lord of ten thousand chariots and follow with a hundred carriages—this is what I excel at.\"\n\nZhuangzi replied: \"The King of Qin had an illness and summoned physicians. Those who lanced boils and drained abscesses received one carriage; those who licked his hemorrhoids received five. The baser the treatment, the more carriages they received. Did you, perchance, treat his hemorrhoids? How else could you have obtained so many carriages? Begone!\"\n\nDuke Ai of Lu asked Yan Wen, saying: \"I regard Confucius as the pillar of the state—will the realm be secure?\"\n\nYan Wen replied: \"It is perilous, verging on collapse! Confucius adorns himself with plumes and ornaments, busies himself with florid speech, takes branches for the root, and suppresses his nature to impress the people, yet he is neither trusted nor believed. He receives from the heart and governs by the spirit—how could such a one be fit to lead the people? Is he truly suited to you? Do you truly approve of him?\"\n\nTo err may yet be permissible. Now, if the people are led to abandon substance for falsity, this is no way to guide them. Considering posterity, it would be better to cease such practices. Governance is difficult—what is imposed upon others yet never forgotten is not the spontaneous bounty of Heaven. Merchants and traders are held in contempt; even when ranked among others by office, the spirit does not acknowledge them. External punishments are meted out by metal and wood; internal punishments arise from movement and transgression. When petty men incur external punishments, metal and wood interrogate them; when they incur internal punishments, yin and yang consume them. Only the true person can escape both external and internal punishments.\n\nConfucius said: \"The human heart is more treacherous than mountains and rivers, harder to fathom than Heaven. Heaven at least has its seasons—spring, autumn, winter, summer—and its fixed times of dawn and dusk. But humans conceal their true nature beneath thick appearances and deep emotions. Thus, some appear earnest yet are deceitful; some seem long-suffering yet are unworthy; some are compliant out of fear yet achieve success; some are resolute yet lax; some are slow yet sharp. Therefore, those who rush toward righteousness as if parched may flee from it as if scorched. Thus, the noble person employs them at a distance to observe their loyalty, employs them closely to observe their reverence, employs them in complexity to observe their ability, questions them abruptly to observe their wisdom, sets urgent deadlines to observe their trustworthiness, entrusts them with wealth to observe their benevolence, warns them of danger to observe their integrity, intoxicates them with wine to observe their restraint, and mingles with them in various settings to observe their demeanor. When these nine tests are complete, the unworthy are revealed.\n\n\"Zheng Kaofu, upon receiving his first appointment, bowed low; upon his second, bent at the waist; upon his third, stooped to the ground, creeping along the wall—who would dare not follow the proper way? But those like him, upon their first appointment, strut like Lü Ju; upon their second, dance atop their carriages; upon their third, address their elders by name—who would align with Tang or Xu?\n\n\"There is no greater harm than virtue with intent, and intent with eyes. When intent has eyes, it turns inward; turning inward, it fails. There are five baleful virtues, and the foremost is the virtue of the center. What is the virtue of the center? It is when one prides oneself on what one favors and disparages what one does not do.\n\n\"Poverty has eight extremes, success three certainties, and the body six repositories. Beauty, whiskers, height, size, strength, loveliness, courage, and boldness—when all eight surpass others, they lead to ruin. Humility, yielding, and timidity that fall short of others—these three lead to success. Wisdom and intelligence that reach outward breed resentment; courage and boldness invite many grudges; benevolence and righteousness incur many demands.\n\n\"Those who grasp the essence of life are like puppets; those who grasp knowledge are diminished; those who grasp the great mandate follow it; those who grasp the small mandate encounter it.\n\n\"A man who had an audience with the King of Song was granted ten carriages, with which he proudly confronted Zhuangzi. Zhuangzi said: 'By the river lived a poor family who made their living weaving rushes. Their son, diving into the depths, found a pearl worth a thousand gold pieces. His father said to him: \"Bring a stone to smash it!\" For a pearl worth a thousand gold pieces must lie beneath the chin of the black dragon in the ninefold abyss. You could only have obtained it because the dragon was asleep. Had the black dragon awakened, what scrap of you would remain? Now, the depths of the state of Song are not merely a ninefold abyss; the ferocity of the King of Song is not merely that of a black dragon. You could only have obtained those carriages because he was asleep. Had the King of Song awakened, you would be reduced to dust.'\n\n\"Another man boasted to Zhuangzi, who replied to his messenger: 'Have you seen the sacrificial ox? It is clothed in embroidered robes and fed with fine grain and beans. Yet when it is led into the great temple, though it might wish to be a lone calf, could it ever be so?'\n\n\"As Zhuangzi neared death, his disciples wished to give him a lavish burial. Zhuangzi said: 'I take heaven and earth as my inner and outer coffins, the sun and moon as my paired jades, the stars and constellations as my pearls and beads, and the myriad things as my funeral gifts. Are my burial preparations not already complete? What could be added to them?' His disciples said:\"\n\n\"‘I fear the crows and kites will feed upon you, Master.’\nZhuangzi said: ‘Above, I would be food for crows and kites; below, I would be food for mole-crickets and ants. To snatch from one to give to the other—how partial you are! To level with what is not level is to make leveling itself unlevel; to verify with what is not verifiable is to make verification itself unverifiable. The enlightened are but servants of the numinous; the numinous verifies them. That the enlightened cannot surpass the numinous has long been so—yet fools rely on what they see to impose upon others. Their merit lies in externals—is this not lamentable?’\n\n*Southern Florescence Perfected Scripture, Scroll Five: \"The World\" (Miscellaneous Chapters, Chapter Thirty-Three)*\n\nThe world’s cultivators of methods and arts are many, each believing their achievements cannot be surpassed. Where, then, does the ancient *Dao*-art reside? It resides nowhere that it is not. How does the numinous descend? How does enlightenment emerge? The sage is born of it; the king is perfected by it—all originate from the One.\n\nNot departing from the Source is called the Celestial Person.\nNot departing from the essence is called the Spirit Person.\nNot departing from the real is called the Perfected Person.\nTaking heaven as their source, virtue as their root, and the Dao as their gate, foreshadowing transformation—this is the sage.\nTaking benevolence as kindness, righteousness as principle, ritual as conduct, and music as harmony, suffused with compassion—this is the noble person.\nTaking law as division, names as markers, comparison as verification, and examination as decision—such are the numbers one, two, three, four, by which the hundred officials rank themselves.\nTaking affairs as constancy, clothing and food as primary, multiplying and storing, caring for the old, weak, orphaned, and widowed—all have their means of nurture: this is the governance of the people.\n\nThe ancients were complete in this. They matched the numinous and bright, harmonized heaven and earth, nourished the myriad things, brought harmony to the world, and extended their blessings to the hundred clans. Illuminating the root and the numbers, connecting to the branches and measures, penetrating the six directions and opening the four gates, whether small or great, refined or coarse, their workings were nowhere absent.\n\nWhat is manifest in numbers and measures—old laws and transmitted histories—still abound. What lies in the *Odes*, *Documents*, *Rites*, and *Music*—scholars of Zou and Lu, and girdle-wearing gentlemen—many can expound. The *Odes* convey the will; the *Documents* convey affairs; the *Rites* convey conduct; the *Music* conveys harmony; the *Changes* convey yin and yang; the *Spring and Autumn Annals* convey names and duties.\n\nThese arts spread throughout the world and were established in the Central States, where the hundred schools at times praised and transmitted them. Yet when the world fell into great disorder, worthies and sages were obscured, the Dao and virtue were not unified, and the world grasped at partial insights to esteem themselves. Like ears, eyes, nose, and mouth, each has its clarity but cannot communicate with the others—so too the hundred schools and their arts, each with its strengths, each useful at times. Yet they are not comprehensive, not impartial: they are scholars of a single corner.\n\nTo judge the beauty of heaven and earth, to analyze the principles of the myriad things, to examine the completeness of the ancients—few can fully embrace the beauty of heaven and earth or match the bearing of the numinous and bright. Thus the Way of inner sageliness and outer kingship has become fragmented and obscure, stifled and unexpressed. The people of the world each follow their desires to create their own methods. Alas! The hundred schools have gone forth and not returned—they will surely not unite.\n\nLater scholars, unfortunate not to see the purity of heaven and earth or the great form of the ancients, will see the *Dao*-art torn apart by the world. Not extravagant toward later generations, not wasteful toward the myriad things, not dazzled by numbers and measures, using the inked line to correct themselves and prepare for the world’s emergencies—this is where the ancient *Dao*-art resided. Mo Di and Qin Guli heard its wind and delighted in it.\n\nThey overdid it, making themselves excessively frugal. They created \"Non-Music,\" calling it \"restraint of excess.\" They did not sing in life and wore no mourning in death. Mozi practiced universal love and mutual benefit, rejecting aggression; his Way did not incite anger. He was also fond of broad learning, not distinguishing between schools, not aligning with the former kings. He condemned the ancient rites and music. The Yellow Emperor had *Xianchi*, Yao had *Dazhang*, Shun had *Dashao*, Yu had *Daxia*, Tang had *Dahu*, King Wen had the music of the *Biyong*, and King Wu and the Duke of Zhou composed *Wu*. In ancient mourning rites, noble and base had their forms, high and low their ranks: the Son of Heaven had seven layers of inner and outer coffins, the feudal lords five, great officers three, and scholars two. Yet Mozi alone did not sing in life, wore no mourning in death, and used a paulownia coffin three inches thick without an outer coffin, making this his model. Teaching others thus, he did not love them; practicing it himself, he did not love himself.\n\nThis did not ruin Mozi’s Way. Yet singing but not singing, weeping but not weeping, joyful but not joyful—was this truly fitting? His life was toilsome, his death meager; his Way was overly austere. It made people anxious, made them sorrowful; his conduct was difficult to practice. I fear it cannot be the Way of the sage, for it turns against the hearts of the world, and the world cannot bear it. Though Mozi alone could endure it, how could the plain people of the world do so? Cut off from the world, he was far from the kingly Way.\n\nMozi spoke of the Dao, saying: ‘In ancient times, Yu controlled the floodwaters, dredged the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, and opened the roads to the four barbarians and nine provinces. There were three hundred famous rivers, three thousand tributaries, and countless smaller ones. Yu personally wielded the spade and plow, blending the labors of the world, his calves bare of skin, his shins bare of hair, his hair washed by heavy rains, his body combed by fierce winds, establishing the ten thousand states. Yu was a great sage, yet he wearied his body for the world to this extent.’ Thus later Mohists wore coarse garments of felt and sandals of hemp, toiling day and night without rest, taking self-imposed hardship as their utmost. They said: ‘If we cannot do this, it is not Yu’s Way—we are unworthy to be called Mohists.’\"\n\nThe disciples of Xiangli Qin, the followers of Wu Hou, the southern Mohists such as Ku Huo, Ji Chi, and Deng Lingzi and their ilk—all recited the *Mo Jing* yet diverged in their interpretations, calling one another \"heterodox Mohists.\" They disparaged one another with debates over the \"hard and white\" and \"same and different,\" responded to each other with arguments of \"riding pairs\" and \"non-congruence,\" and revered the Grand Master as a sage. Each wished to be his successor, hoping to carry on his legacy, and to this day they have not ceased.\n\nMo Di and Qin Guli’s intentions were sound, but their conduct was misguided. They sought to compel later Mohists to emulate Yu’s self-imposed hardship—bare calves, hairless shins—merely vying in asceticism. This is the height of disorder and the nadir of governance. Yet Mozi was truly a man of lofty aspirations in the world, one whose like is sought in vain. Though he withered away, he never abandoned his cause—a man of true talent indeed! Unburdened by convention, unadorned by material things, uncompromising with others, and unyielding to the crowd.\n\nHe longed for the world’s peace to preserve human life, ceasing only when both self and others were sufficiently provided for, thus purifying his heart. Among the ancient arts of the Dao, Song Jian and Yin Wen heard of his teachings and embraced them. They fashioned the Hua Shan cap as a symbol, engaging with all things by first dispelling obstructions. They spoke of the mind’s capacity, calling it \"the mind’s conduct,\" seeking to unite through shame and harmonize the world, proposing to establish this as their guiding principle. They endured insults without feeling dishonored, saving the people’s states, forbidding aggression and halting warfare to end the world’s strife. With this, they traversed the world, persuading rulers above and instructing the people below. Though the world rejected them, they persisted stubbornly, clamoring without cease—thus they were met with weariness above and below yet forced themselves upon others.\n\nYet their selflessness was too great, their personal needs too few. They said: \"Let us fix five *sheng* of rice as sufficient. If the master fears hunger, the disciples, though starving, will not forget the world.\" Day and night without rest, they declared: \"We must surely bring life to the world!\" How lofty were these saviors of the age! They said: \"The noble man does not nitpick, nor does he lend himself to things. What benefits nothing in the world is better left unclarified.\" Externally, they forbade aggression and halted warfare; internally, they sought to diminish desires and reduce excess. Their teachings, whether grand or minute, refined or coarse, extended only so far as this.\n\nImpartial yet not partisan, yielding yet without bias, they stood apart without allegiance, following things without duality, unconcerned with deliberation, unswayed by cunning. They made no distinctions among things, moving with them as one. Among the ancient arts of the Dao, Peng Meng, Tian Pian, and Shen Dao heard of their teachings and embraced them. They took the equality of the ten thousand things as their starting point, saying: \"Heaven can cover them but not bear them; earth can bear them but not cover them; the great Dao can encompass them but not distinguish them.\" Knowing that all things have their \"can\" and \"cannot,\" they said: \"Selection without bias, teaching without omission, the Dao leaves nothing behind.\"\n\nThus Shen Dao discarded knowledge and self, following only what could not be avoided, letting things flow naturally to form his principles. He said: \"To know that one does not know is to approach harm by clinging to knowledge.\" Unburdened by responsibility, he mocked the world’s esteem for worthies; unbound by conduct, he rejected the world’s great sages. He pushed and pulled, severed and cut, adapting to things, setting aside right and wrong, seeking only to avoid harm. Unbound by wisdom or foresight, indifferent to past or future, he simply existed. He moved only when pushed, advanced only when dragged, like a whirling wind, a spinning feather, a grinding stone’s path—whole and without fault, his movements and stillness without error, never incurring blame.\n\nWhy was this so? For things without knowledge have no peril of self-assertion, no burden of wisdom’s use. Their movement and stillness never depart from principle, thus they live without praise. Therefore, he said: \"To be like things without knowledge is enough. There is no need for worthies or sages—such rarity does not lose the Dao.\" Yet the proud and eminent mocked him, saying: \"Shen Dao’s Dao is not the conduct of the living but the principle of the dead—how strange indeed!\"\n\nTian Pian was the same. Studying under Peng Meng, he received \"non-teaching.\" Peng Meng’s master said: \"The ancient Daoists reached the point of neither affirming nor denying.\" Their manner was open and free, beyond words. They constantly opposed others, avoided gathering crowds, and did not fall into rigid judgments. What they called the Dao was not the Dao, yet their words did not err into falsity. Peng Meng, Tian Pian, and Shen Dao did not know the Dao, yet all had glimpsed it.\n\nTaking the root as essence, things as coarse, accumulation as insufficiency, they stood alone in communion with the spiritually luminous. Among the ancient arts of the Dao, Guan Yin and Lao Dan heard of their teachings and embraced them. They built upon the constant of \"non-being\" and \"being,\" governed by the Great One, taking gentleness, weakness, humility, and emptiness as their outward form, and the non-destruction of the ten thousand things as their substance.\n\nGuan Yin said: \"Within oneself, hold nothing; let things manifest naturally. In movement, be like water; in stillness, like a mirror; in response, like an echo. Fading like absence, silent like purity. Those who harmonize gain; those who grasp lose. Never precede others, always follow.\"\n\nLao Dan said: \"Know the masculine, guard the feminine, and be the world’s stream. Know the bright, guard the humble, and be the world’s valley.\" While others sought precedence, he alone took the rear, saying: \"I bear the world’s filth.\" While others sought fullness, he alone took emptiness, having no hoarding and thus abundance—abundant yet unadorned. In conducting himself, he was unhurried and unexhausted, effortless yet mocking cleverness. While others sought fortune, he alone sought preservation through humility, saying: \"I merely avoid blame.\" Taking depth as his root, simplicity as his guiding principle, he said: \"What is rigid breaks; what is sharp is blunted.\"\n\nEver tolerant toward all things, never carving away at others—this may be called the ultimate. Ah, Guan Yin and Lao Dan! Truly the vast and authentic persons of antiquity. Still and formless, ever-changing and constant, they moved with death and life, with heaven and earth, with the spirits and the bright. Vast and boundless, where did they go? Fleeting and swift, where did they alight? All things were encompassed, yet none could serve as their refuge. The ancient arts of the Dao resided in this, and Zhuang Zhou, hearing of their influence, delighted in it.\n\nWith meandering discourse, boundless words, and speech without limit, he gave free rein to his ideas without constraint, not relying on rigid perceptions. He saw the world as turbid and unfit for solemn speech, so he used carefree words to let meanings unfold, weighty words to convey truth, and parables to broaden understanding. Alone he communed with the spirit of heaven and earth, never condescending to the myriad things, nor entangled in right and wrong, yet dwelling among the common customs of the age. Though his writings were flawed and rough, they remained unharmed. Though his words were uneven and strange, they were still worthy of contemplation. His fullness could not be exhausted: above, he roamed with the Creator, and below, he befriended those beyond death and life, without beginning or end.\n\nIn his approach to the root, he was vast and expansive, profound and unrestrained. In his grasp of the essence, he was harmonious and ascended to the heights. Yet in responding to transformations and dissolving things, his principles never ran dry, his insights never faded. Vague and obscure, their depths were never fully plumbed.\n\nHui Shi was a man of many methods. His writings filled five carts, but his doctrines were contradictory, and his words often missed the mark. In his exploration of things, he declared: \"What is greatest has no outside—call it the Great One. What is smallest has no inside—call it the Small One. What has no thickness cannot accumulate, yet it spans a thousand miles. Heaven and earth are low; mountains and marshes are level. The sun is both at its zenith and setting; things are both born and dying. Great sameness differs from small sameness—this is called the small sameness and difference. All things are entirely the same and entirely different—this is called the great sameness and difference. The south is both boundless and bounded. Today I go to Yue, yet I arrived yesterday. Linked rings can be unlinked. I know the center of the world—it lies north of Yan and south of Yue. Embracing all things, heaven and earth are one.\"\n\nHui Shi took this as his great principle, and when he surveyed the world to enlighten the debaters, the debaters of the world rejoiced in it together. They delighted in paradoxes: eggs have feathers; a chicken has three feet; Ying possesses the world; a dog can be a sheep; horses lay eggs; tadpoles have tails; fire is not hot; mountains have mouths; wheels do not touch the ground; eyes do not see; pointing does not reach, yet reaching is unceasing; tortoises are longer than snakes; squares are not square, and compasses cannot draw circles; chisels do not fit their handles; the shadow of a flying bird never moves; the speed of an arrow includes moments of neither motion nor stillness; a dog is not a canine; a yellow horse and a black ox make three; a white dog is black; a foal has never had a mother; if you take half of a one-foot stick each day, it will never be exhausted after ten thousand generations.\n\nThe debaters used these to engage with Hui Shi, and their arguments never ceased. Huan Tuan and Gongsun Long, followers of the debaters, adorned people’s minds and altered their intentions. They could win in speech but not convince the heart—such were the confines of the debaters. Hui Shi daily used his knowledge to contend with others, setting himself apart to create marvels with the world’s debaters. This was his foundation.\n\nYet Hui Shi’s eloquence led him to consider himself the most worthy, declaring, \"How grand are heaven and earth!\" He possessed boldness but no defense. In the south there was a man named Huang Liao who asked why heaven and earth did not collapse or sink, and the causes of wind, rain, thunder, and lightning. Hui Shi did not decline to answer, nor did he ponder before responding. He expounded on the myriad things without end, speaking ceaselessly, and though he thought his words too few, he added even more marvels. He took contrariness as truth and sought fame through victory, which is why he never fit in with the crowd. Weak in virtue but strong in things, his path was perilous.\n\nViewing Hui Shi’s abilities through the Dao of heaven and earth, he was like a gnat or a mosquito laboring in vain. What use was he to things? Even if one fills a single principle, one may still say it is insufficient—how much more so for valuing the Dao! Hui Shi could not find peace in this; he scattered himself among the myriad things without weariness, and in the end, he was known only for his skill in debate. Alas for Hui Shi’s talent—soaring yet unfulfilled, chasing the myriad things without return. He was like an echo chasing sound, or a form racing its shadow. How pitiful!",

      "translated_text": "Zhuangzi was a native of Song, named Zhou, styled You. He was born in Meng County of Suiyang. He once served as the warden of the Lacquer Garden in Meng. His learning left no field unexamined, but its essence returned to the words of Laozi. Thus, he composed a work of over a hundred thousand characters, most of which were parables. His words flowed boundlessly, following his own inclinations, so that even kings and nobles could not confine him. King Wei of Chu, hearing of Zhuangzi’s worth, sent envoys with generous gifts to invite him, offering the position of minister. Zhuangzi laughed and said to the envoys: \"A thousand gold pieces are a great profit; the rank of minister is a lofty position. Have you alone never seen the sacrificial ox at the suburban rites? Fed for years, adorned with embroidered trappings, it is led into the great temple. At that moment, if it wished to be a lone piglet, could it do so? Begone at once, and do not defile me. I would rather roam and play in the mire for my own delight than be fettered by rulers.

      "translated_text": "Moreover, when water is not deeply accumulated, it lacks the strength to bear a great vessel. Pour a cup of water onto a hollow in the hall’s floor, and a mustard seed becomes a boat for it; set the cup there and it sticks fast, for the water is shallow and the vessel large. When wind is not deeply accumulated, it lacks the strength to bear great wings. Thus, only when the wind lies beneath ninety thousand *li* can it be borne up; only then, riding the wind, back pressing against the blue sky without obstacle, can one at last set course for the south.\n\nThe cicada and the fledgling dove laugh at this, saying: \"We burst forth and fly, striking the elm and sandalwood, and when we cannot reach them, we simply settle back to earth—that is all. Why go ninety thousand *li* to journey south?\" To travel to the near wilderness, one returns after a morning’s meal with belly still full; to travel a hundred *li*, one must spend the night grinding grain; to travel a thousand *li*, one must gather provisions for three months. What do these two creatures know?\n\nSmall knowledge does not reach great knowledge; short years do not reach long years. How do we know this is so? The morning mushroom knows not the alternation of dusk and dawn; the summer cicada knows not spring and autumn—these are short-lived. South of Chu there is the *Mingling* tree, which takes five hundred years as its spring and five hundred years as its autumn; in high antiquity there was the *Dazhuang* tree, which took eight thousand years as its spring and eight thousand years as its autumn. Yet Pengzu alone is renowned today for his longevity—how pitiful that the multitude compares itself to him!\n\nThis is what Tang asked Ji about: North of the lands where no plants grow lies the Dark Sea, the Heavenly Pond. There is a fish there, several thousand *li* in breadth, though none knows its length—its name is Kun. There is a bird there, its name Peng, its back like Mount Tai, its wings like clouds hanging from the sky. It strikes the whirlwind and spirals upward ninety thousand *li*, cutting through the clouds and qi, pressing against the blue sky, then sets course for the south, bound for the Southern Darkness. The minnow scoffs at it, saying: \"Where is it going? I leap and soar, rising no more than a few fathoms before descending, wheeling among the mugwort and wormwood—this is the utmost of flight. Where is it going?\" This is the distinction between small and great.\n\nThus, those whose knowledge suffices for one office, whose conduct matches one village, whose virtue pleases one lord, or whose merit wins one state—they view themselves as this minnow does. Song Rongzi would merely laugh at them. Even if the whole world praised him, he would not be encouraged; even if the whole world blamed him, he would not be disheartened. He firmly distinguishes between inner and outer, clearly discerns the boundary of honor and disgrace—this is all. In his dealings with the world, he is not eager. Yet even he has not yet established himself.\n\nLiezi rode the wind and traveled, effortlessly graceful, returning after fifteen days. In his pursuit of good fortune, he was not eager. Though he thus avoided walking, he still depended on something. As for one who rides the constancy of Heaven and Earth, who harnesses the transformations of the six qi, and roams the boundless—what does he depend on? Therefore it is said: The Perfect One is without self; the Spirit Man is without achievement; the Sage is without name.\n\nYao offered the world to Xu You, saying: \"When the sun and moon have risen, yet the torch still burns—is it not difficult for its light to be seen? When timely rain has fallen, yet one still waters the fields—is it not labor in vain? You stand and the world is well-governed, yet I still occupy the throne. I see myself as lacking—please take the world.\" Xu You said: \"You govern the world, and the world is already well-governed. Were I to replace you, would I do it for the name? A name is but the guest of reality—would I become a guest? The wren nests in the deep forest, yet needs only a single branch; the mole drinks from the river, yet needs only a bellyful. Return, my lord—I have no use for the world. Even if the cook does not prepare the food, the master of ceremonies does not leap over the wine vessels and sacrificial stands to take his place.\"\n\nJian Wu said to Lian Shu: \"I heard words from Jie Yu—grand yet without measure, going yet not returning. I was alarmed and terrified by them, as if the Milky Way stretched endlessly, vast and distant, far from human concerns.\" Lian Shu said: \"What did he say?\" Jian Wu replied: \"On distant Mount Gushe, there dwells a spirit man. His skin is like ice and snow, his grace like that of a maiden. He eats no grain, but inhales the wind and drinks the dew. He rides the clouds and qi, drives flying dragons, and roams beyond the four seas. His spirit is concentrated, and he causes things to be free of blight so that the grain ripens.

I planted them, and they grew to bear fruit weighing five *dan*. When I used it to hold water, its strength was insufficient to support itself. When I split it to make a ladle, its size was so vast it could hold nothing. It is not that it was not impressively large—it was simply useless, so I discarded it.'\n\nZhuangzi replied: 'You are truly inept at putting great things to use. There was a man of Song skilled in making an ointment that prevented chapping. For generations, his family had made their living by fulling silk. A traveler heard of this and offered to buy the formula for a hundred pieces of gold. The family gathered to deliberate: \"For generations, we have fulling silk and earned no more than a few pieces of gold. Now, in a single morning, we can sell our craft for a hundred. Let us give it to him.\" The traveler acquired it and presented it to the King of Wu. When Yue raised a rebellion, the King of Wu sent him to lead his troops. In winter, they fought the Yue on the water and crushed them. The king then granted him a fiefdom. The ability to prevent chapping was the same, yet one man gained a fief while another remained a fuller of silk—the difference lay in how it was used. Now you have a gourd of five *dan*—why not consider making it into a great float and drifting upon the rivers and lakes, instead of fretting that its size leaves it with no place to hold anything? Your mind is still as tangled as a clump of weeds.'\n\nHui Zi said to Zhuangzi: 'I have a great tree, which people call the *chu*. Its trunk is so gnarled and swollen that it does not meet the carpenter’s line, and its branches are so twisted that they do not conform to compass or square. Though it stands by the roadside, no craftsman gives it a glance. Now your words are grand but useless—just as the world turns away from them.'\n\nZhuangzi replied: 'Have you never seen a wildcat? It crouches low to lie in wait, pouncing on whatever passes by. It leaps east and west, heedless of height or depth.'\"",

His skin is like ice and snow, his grace like that of a maiden. He eats no grain, but inhales the wind and drinks the dew. He rides the clouds and qi, drives flying dragons, and roams beyond the four seas. His spirit is concentrated, and he causes things to be free of blight so that the grain ripens.

      "translated_text": "In sleep, the soul intertwines; in waking, the form unfurls. Engaged with the world, we weave our bonds, daily waging war within the heart. Some drift aimlessly, some burrow deep, some cling in secrecy. Small fears leave us trembling; great fears unravel us entirely.\n\nTheir eruptions are like the release of a crossbow’s trigger—this is what we call the judgment of right and wrong. Their restraint is like a sworn oath—this is what we call the clinging to victory. Their decay is like autumn and winter, speaking of the daily erosion. Their drowning in habit cannot be reversed. Their weariness is like a sealed casket, speaking of the stagnation of age. The heart near death cannot be revived. Joy and anger, sorrow and delight, anxiety and sighing, fickleness and caprice, indulgence and abandon—these arise like music from the void, like mushrooms from the steam. Day and night they alternate before us, yet none know where they sprout.\n\nEnough, enough! If one could grasp this even at dusk, would it not be the very source of life? Without that, there is no self; without the self, there is nothing to grasp. This is close indeed, yet we know not what moves it. As if there were a true master, yet no trace of it can be found. It can act and be trusted, yet its form is unseen. It has essence but no shape.\n\nThe hundred bones, nine orifices, six viscera—all are complete within me. Which should I hold most dear? Do you delight in all of them equally? Or do you favor some? Are they all servants and maids? If servants and maids cannot govern one another, do they take turns as lord and subject? Or is there a true lord residing within? Whether one seeks to know its nature or not, it neither adds to nor diminishes the truth.\n\nOnce the formed shape is received, it does not perish until its end. It clashes and grinds against things, racing toward exhaustion like a galloping steed—yet nothing can halt it. Is this not lamentable? To toil a lifetime without seeing success, to wear oneself out in exhaustion without knowing one’s destination—how can this not be sorrowful? If one calls this not death, what good is it? The body transforms, the heart follows suit—can this not be called great sorrow?\n\nIs human life inherently so confused? Am I alone in my confusion, while others remain unconfused? If one follows the heart that has already taken shape and takes it as a teacher, who is without a teacher? Why must one know the cycles of change and let the heart choose for itself? Even fools possess this. To have right and wrong before the heart is fully formed is like setting out for Yue today and arriving yesterday. This is to take what does not exist as existent. To take what does not exist as existent—even the divine Yu could not comprehend it, so how can I?\n\nSpeech is not the wind’s breath. Those who speak have words, yet what they speak of remains unsettled. Is there truly speech? Or has there never been speech? Do they deem it different from the chirping of fledglings? Is there distinction, or is there none?\n\nWhere does the Dao hide that it has truth and falsehood? Where do words hide that they have right and wrong? Where does the Dao go that it ceases to exist? Where do words abide that they cannot be trusted? The Dao is obscured by minor achievements; words are obscured by florid embellishment. Thus arise the disputes of Confucians and Mohists, each affirming what the other denies and denying what the other affirms. To affirm what the other denies and deny what the other affirms, nothing surpasses clarity.\n\nNothing exists that is not \"that\"; nothing exists that is not \"this.\" From \"that,\" one does not see; from self-knowledge, one knows. Thus it is said: \"That\" emerges from \"this,\" and \"this\" likewise depends on \"that.\" \"That\" and \"this\" are born together in the same moment. Yet even as they are born, they die; even as they die, they are born. Even as something is deemed right, it is deemed wrong; even as it is deemed wrong, it is deemed right. Thus the sage does not proceed by this path but illuminates all by the light of Heaven—this too is \"that.\"\n\n\"This\" is also \"that,\" and \"that\" is also \"this.\" \"That\" has its own right and wrong, and \"this\" has its own right and wrong. Is there truly a distinction between \"that\" and \"this\"? Or is there no distinction? Where \"that\" and \"this\" find no opposition is called the pivot of the Dao.

To illustrate the horse’s non-horsehood with a horse is not as good as illustrating the horse’s non-horsehood with a non-horse. Heaven and Earth are one finger; the myriad things are one horse.\n\nWhat is deemed right is right; what is deemed wrong is wrong. The Dao proceeds and thereby achieves; things name it and thereby affirm. How is it affirmed? Affirmed as affirmed. How is it not affirmed? Not affirmed as not affirmed. Things inherently have what they affirm; things inherently have what they deem right. There is nothing that is not affirmed; there is nothing that is not deemed right.\n\nThus, take the examples of the tumbleweed and the pillar, the hag and Xi Shi, the vast and the grotesque, the strange and the monstrous—through the Dao, all become one.

Yet for all things, there is no completion and no destruction, for they revert to becoming one.\n\nOnly those who comprehend this unity do not employ it but lodge it in the ordinary.

Next are those who hold that things exist, yet boundaries have never yet arisen. Next are those who hold that boundaries exist, yet right and wrong have never yet appeared. The manifestation of right and wrong is what causes the Dao to be diminished. The diminishment of the Dao is what gives rise to partiality. Is there truly completion and diminishment? Or is there truly no completion and diminishment? If there were completion and diminishment, then Master Zhao’s zither-playing would be an example. If there were no completion and diminishment, then Master Zhao’s not playing the zither would be an example. Master Zhao’s zither-playing, Music Master Kuang’s wielding of his baton, and Master Hui’s leaning against the parasol tree—these three men’s knowledge approached subtlety. All were at their peak, and thus their deeds are recorded at life’s end. Yet because they were fond of these things, they set themselves apart from others; because they were fond of them, they sought to make them clear. But what they sought to clarify was not truly clarifiable, and so they ended in the obscurity of \"hard and white.\" And Master Zhao’s son, in turn, spent his life spinning the threads of his father’s art, yet achieved nothing. If this can be called achievement, then even I have achieved. If this cannot be called achievement, then neither things nor I have achieved. Thus, the dazzling confusion of doubt is what the sage contemplates.

Suddenly there is being and non-being, yet we do not know which of the two—being or non-being—is truly so. Now, I have already spoken, yet I do not know whether what I have spoken is truly speaking or truly not speaking.\n\nNothing in the world is greater than the tip of an autumn hair, yet Mount Tai is small. No one is longer-lived than a child who dies young, yet Pengzu died prematurely. Heaven and Earth were born together with me, and the myriad things and I are one. Since we are already one, can there be speech? Since I have already called it one, can there be no speech? One and speech make two; two and one make three. Proceeding from this, even the most skilled mathematician cannot arrive at a number, much less an ordinary person. Thus, from non-being to being, we reach three—how much more so from being to being! Do not proceed; follow this.\n\nThe Dao has never had boundaries; speech has never had constancy. It is for the sake of \"this\" that there are disputes. Let me speak of these disputes: There is left and right, there are ranks and principles, there are divisions and distinctions, there are competition and contention—these are called the eight virtues. Beyond the six directions, the sage acknowledges but does not discuss; within the six directions, the sage discusses but does not debate. The *Spring and Autumn Annals* and the chronicles of former kings’ reigns—the sage debates but does not argue. Thus, division implies what is not divided; distinction implies what is not distinguished. Why is this? The sage embraces it, while the multitude debates it to display to one another. Thus it is said: Those who debate do so because they do not see.\n\nThe great Dao is not named; great disputation does not speak; great benevolence is not benevolent; great integrity is not frugal; great courage is not aggressive. The Dao that is manifest is not the Dao; speech that debates does not reach; benevolence that is constant does not accomplish; integrity that is pure is not trustworthy; courage that relies on skill does not succeed. These five, though rounded, nearly tend toward the square. Thus, to know where to stop in what one does not know—this is the utmost. Who knows the disputation of no-speech, the Dao of no-Dao? If one could know it, this would be called the \"Heavenly Storehouse.\" It can be drawn from without ever being filled, and ladled from without ever being exhausted, yet one does not know its source—this is called \"preserving the light.\"\n\nThus, in ancient times, Yao asked Shun: \"I wish to attack Zong, Kuai, and Xu’ao. When I sit facing south, I feel uneasy. What is the reason?\" Shun said: \"Those three rulers dwell among the weeds and brambles. Why do you feel uneasy? Long ago, ten suns rose together, and the myriad things were all illuminated—how much more so the virtue that surpasses the sun!\"\n\nNie Que asked Wang Ni: \"Do you know what things all agree upon as right?\" Wang Ni said: \"How would I know?\" \"Do you know what you do not know?\" \"How would I know?\" \"Then do things have no knowledge?\" \"How would I know? Nevertheless, let me try to speak of it. How do I know that what I call knowing is not not-knowing? How do I know that what I call not-knowing is not knowing? Moreover, let me ask you this: If people sleep in damp places, their waists will ache and they will be half-paralyzed—is that so for an eel? If they live in trees, they will tremble with fear—is that so for a monkey? Of these three, which knows the proper place to dwell? People eat the flesh of grass-fed and grain-fed animals; deer eat grass; centipedes delight in snakes; owls and crows relish mice. Of these four, which knows the proper taste? Monkeys mate with monkeys, deer consort with deer, eels swim with fish. Mao Qiang and Li Ji were considered beautiful by people, but when fish saw them, they dove deep; when birds saw them, they flew high; when deer saw them, they dashed away. Of these four, which knows the proper beauty of the world? From my perspective, the beginnings of benevolence and righteousness, the paths of right and wrong, are tangled and confused—how could I know how to distinguish them?\"\n\nNie Que said: \"If you do not know benefit and harm, then does the perfected person truly not know benefit and harm?\" Wang Ni said: \"The perfected person is spirit-like. If great marshes burned, they could not be hot; if the Yellow River and Han River froze, they could not be cold; if swift thunder split mountains and winds shook the sea, they could not be startled. One like this rides the clouds and mist, mounts the sun and moon, and roams beyond the four seas.\"",
      "overlap_context": "d chestnuts, saying, \"Three in the morning and four in the evening.\" The monkeys were all enraged. He then said, \"Very well, four in the morning and three in the evening.\" The monkeys were all pleased. The names and realities remained unchanged, yet joy and anger were employed—this too is following \"that.\"\n\nThus the sage harmonizes with right and wrong and rests in the equality of Heaven—this is called walking two paths. The ancients, their knowledge reached a certain point—how far did it reach?",

      "translated_text": "Death and life bring no change to oneself—how could they be the beginnings of benefit and harm?\n\nMaster Juque asked Master Changwu: \"I have heard from the Master that the sage does not engage in worldly affairs, does not pursue profit, does not avoid harm, does not delight in seeking, does not follow the Dao/Way. Without words, there are words; with words, there are no words—and thus roams beyond the dust and grime. The Master considered this reckless speech, but I regard it as the practice of the wondrous Dao/Way. What do you think?\"\n\nMaster Changwu said: \"This is what the Yellow Emperor found enlightening to hear. Yet how could Confucius (Qiu) be sufficient to understand it? Moreover, you are far too hasty in your calculations—seeing the dawn and demanding the night, seeing the slingshot and craving the roasted crow. I have spoken to you idly; you have listened idly. Why cling to sun and moon, embrace the cosmos? For its harmony and union, set aside its confusion and chaos, and serve as equals in mutual respect. The masses toil; the sage appears foolish and dull. Through the myriad ages, all becomes one pure whole. All things are thus, and in this they are mutually enfolded.\n\nHow do you know that delight in life is not delusion? How do you know that aversion to death is not like one who has lost his way and does not know how to return? Lady Li was the daughter of the border warden of Ai. When the state of Jin first obtained her, she wept until her robes were soaked. Yet once she arrived at the king’s palace, shared his bed and ate fine meats, she regretted her tears. How do I know that the dead do not regret their former clinging to life?\n\nOne who dreams of drinking wine may weep at dawn; one who dreams of weeping may go hunting at sunrise. In the midst of the dream, one does not know it is a dream. Within the dream, one may even interpret the dream—only upon waking does one know it was a dream. And only with great awakening does one realize that all this was a great dream. Yet fools believe themselves awake, arrogantly claiming to know. Lords! Shepherds! How rigid they are! Confucius (Qiu) and you—we are all dreaming. When I say you are dreaming, I too am dreaming. Such words are called ‘uncanny.’ Even after ten thousand generations, should a great sage appear who understands their meaning, it would be as if we had met him at dawn or dusk.\n\nSuppose you and I were to debate: if you defeat me, and I do not defeat you, does that mean you are truly right and I am truly wrong? If I defeat you, and you do not defeat me, does that mean I am truly right and you are truly wrong? Is one of us right and the other wrong? Are both of us right or both wrong? You and I cannot know, and others are surely as confused. Whom shall we ask to decide? If we ask someone who agrees with you, how can he decide since he already agrees with you? If we ask someone who agrees with me, how can he decide since he already agrees with me? If we ask someone who differs from both of us, how can he decide since he differs from both of us? If we ask someone who agrees with both of us, how can he decide since he agrees with both of us? Thus, you, I, and others cannot know—must we wait for another?\n\nWhat does it mean to harmonize with the heavenly equality? It means: ‘Is’ or ‘is not,’ ‘so’ or ‘not so.’ If ‘is’ is truly ‘is,’ then the difference between ‘is’ and ‘is not’ requires no debate. If ‘so’ is truly ‘so,’ then the difference between ‘so’ and ‘not so’ requires no debate. The mutual dependence of changing voices—if they did not depend on one another—would be harmonized by the heavenly equality, carried along by the boundless, and thus one could live out one’s years. Forgetting years, forgetting righteousness, one is stirred by the boundless and thus abides in the boundless.\n\nWang Liang asked Qi: \"In the past, you walked—now you stop. In the past, you sat—now you rise. Why are you so without constancy?\"\n\nQi said: \"I act as I must—is that it? What I must do also depends on something else—is that it?

To strive with the bounded after the boundless is perilous. And to strive thus as one who knows is perilous indeed. In doing good, avoid proximity to fame; in doing evil, avoid proximity to punishment. Follow the central course as your constant guide—thus may you preserve your body, fulfill your life, nurture your kin, and live out your years.\n\nCook Ding carved an ox for Lord Wenhui. Where his hand touched, where his shoulder leaned, where his foot pressed, where his knee braced—*hua!*—the skin parted, the blade sang, never missing the rhythm, harmonizing with the *Sanglin* dance, attaining the *Jingshou* melody.\n\nLord Wenhui exclaimed: \"Ah! How excellent! Has skill truly reached such heights?\"\n\nCook Ding set down his knife and replied: \"What your servant loves is the Dao—it has advanced beyond mere skill. When I first began carving oxen, all I saw was the ox. After three years, I no longer saw the whole ox. Now, I meet it with my spirit rather than my eyes; my senses cease, and my spirit moves. I follow the natural grain, cleave through the great gaps, guide the blade through the great cavities, all according to its inherent pattern. I never touch the ligaments or tendons, much less the solid bone. A good cook changes his knife every year—it is worn from cutting. A mediocre cook changes his knife every month—it is broken from hacking. This knife of mine has lasted nineteen years, carving thousands of oxen, yet its edge is as if newly whetted. The joints have spaces, but the blade has no thickness. With what has no thickness entering where there is space, there is surely ample room for the blade to move—this is why after nineteen years, its edge is as if newly whetted. Still, whenever I come to a complex joint, I see the difficulty, pause in caution, focus my gaze, slow my movement, and move the blade with utmost care. Then—*tiao!*—it falls apart like earth crumbling to the ground. I stand holding the knife, look around in satisfaction, wipe it clean, and put it away.\"\n\nLord Wenhui said: \"Excellent!

      "translated_text": "Yan Hui said, \"I have heard that the Lord of Wei is in his prime, yet his conduct is willful. He treats the lives of his people lightly, and the dead in his state are measured by marshlands as if they were hemp—his people have nowhere to turn. I once heard from you, Master, that one should leave a well-ordered state and go to a disordered one, for a physician’s gate is crowded with the sick. I wish to apply what I have heard to ponder its principles, hoping that his state might yet be saved.\"\n\nConfucius said, \"Alas! You will likely go only to be punished. The Dao does not tolerate杂乱;杂乱 leads to excess, excess to disturbance, disturbance to sorrow, and sorrow cannot be remedied. The perfected of old first established it within themselves before establishing it in others. If what is established within oneself is not yet settled, how can one attend to the conduct of a violent ruler?\n\n\"Do you also know whence virtue’s dissipation and knowledge’s emergence arise? Virtue dissipates into fame, and knowledge emerges from contention. Fame is a means of mutual oppression; knowledge is an instrument of contention. Both are inauspicious tools, not to be fully enacted. Moreover, one whose virtue is profound and whose sincerity is proven may not yet penetrate the people’s *qi*; one whose fame is widespread and who does not contend may not yet reach the people’s hearts. To forcefully present the language of仁义 and the carpenter’s墨 before a violent ruler is to make others resent what they themselves possess as beauty—this is called ‘sowing resentment.’ One who sows resentment will surely be resented in return. Are you not then sowing resentment for others?\n\n\"If you merely delight in the worthy and despise the unworthy, what need is there to seek distinction? If you do not issue commands, the lords will surely exploit others to vie for advantage. Your eyes will be dazzled, your countenance smoothed, your mouth will flatter, your demeanor will conform, and your heart will comply. This is like extinguishing fire with fire or flooding with water—it is called ‘adding to the excess.’ To follow such a beginning without end is to risk, with insincere grand words, certain death before a violent ruler.\n\n\"In ancient times, Jie killed Guan Longfeng, and Zhou killed Prince Bigan—both were men who cultivated themselves to humble the people and opposed their superiors. Thus, their lords used their cultivation to cast them out. These were lovers of fame. Formerly, Yao attacked Congzhi and Xu’ao, and Yu attacked Youhu. Their states became wastelands, their persons executed. Their use of arms did not cease, their pursuit of substance knew no end. These were seekers of fame and substance. Have you alone not heard of this? Fame and substance are what even the sages cannot overcome—how much less can you?\n\n\"Nevertheless, if you must have a way, come and tell me.\"\n\nYan Hui said, \"If I am upright yet empty, diligent yet single-minded, will that suffice?\"\n\nConfucius said, \"Alas, how could it? One who is full of yang, brash and ostentatious, whose colors shift unpredictably, is not one whom ordinary people can oppose. To follow others’ impulses in seeking to please their hearts is called ‘daily accumulating virtue that never forms’—how much less can great virtue be achieved? To cling rigidly without transformation, to conform outwardly while inwardly undervaluing, how could that ever suffice?\n\n\"Then let me be inwardly straight yet outwardly yielding, achieving while aligning with the ancients. To be inwardly straight is to follow Heaven. One who follows Heaven knows that the Son of Heaven and oneself are both children of Heaven. Why should one alone take credit when others praise one’s words, or blame when they do not? Such a one is called a child—this is what it means to follow Heaven. To be outwardly yielding is to follow others. Bowing the head and bending the knees are the rites of a minister. If all do so, how dare I not? To do what others do is to incur no blame—this is what it means to follow others. To achieve while aligning with the ancients is to follow antiquity.

      "translated_text": "Yan Hui said, \"My family is poor. For months now, I have neither drunk wine nor eaten meat. Would this suffice as fasting?\"\n\nConfucius replied, \"That is the fasting for ancestral sacrifices, not the fasting of the mind.\"\n\nYan Hui asked, \"May I inquire about the fasting of the mind?\"\n\nConfucius said, \"Unify your will. Do not listen with the ears but listen with the mind. Do not listen with the mind but listen with qi. Listening stops at the ears; the mind stops at mere correspondence. Qi is what is empty and awaits things. Only the Dao gathers in emptiness. Emptiness is the fasting of the mind.\"\n\nYan Hui said, \"Before I was instructed, I was truly myself. Once instructed, it is as though I no longer exist. Can this be called emptiness?\"\n\nConfucius said, \"You have grasped it fully. Let me tell you: If you can enter and wander within its bounds without being moved by reputation, respond when moved, and cease when not—this is near perfection. To sever ties with the near is easy; to walk without treading the earth is difficult. To be employed by others is easy to feign; to be employed by Heaven is difficult to feign. One has heard of flying with wings, but never of flying without wings; one has heard of knowing with knowledge, but never of knowing without knowledge. Look upon that emptiness—where the empty chamber generates brightness, and auspiciousness comes to rest. If one does not come to rest, this is called sitting while galloping. To follow the ears and eyes while inwardly communicating but outwardly cutting off the mind’s knowledge—even spirits and gods will come to dwell, let alone men. This is the transformation of the myriad things, the pivot of Yu and Shun, the ultimate path of Fuxi and the near-perfected—how much more so for those who are scattered?\n\nWhen Viscount Gaoyang of Ye was about to be sent as an envoy to Qi, he asked Confucius, 'The king’s charge to me is most weighty. The Qi court treats envoys with great respect but does not hasten to match their rank. Even a common man cannot be swayed—how much less a feudal lord? I am deeply apprehensive. You once told me: In all affairs, whether great or small, few succeed without following the Dao to achieve harmony. If the affair does not succeed, one must face the calamities of human relations; if it does succeed, one must face the calamities of yin and yang. Only one of power can succeed or fail without harm. I eat coarse food and do not seek refinement, yet I am one who desires no cooling. Now, upon receiving my charge this morning, I drink ice by evening—am I not inwardly burning? Before I have even reached the truth of the matter, I already face the calamities of yin and yang. If the affair does not succeed, I must face the calamities of human relations. These two outcomes are beyond what a minister can bear. Pray, instruct me further.'\n\nConfucius said, 'Under Heaven there are two great precepts: one is fate, the other is duty. A child’s love for parents is fate—it cannot be untied from the heart. A minister’s service to his lord is duty—there is no place between Heaven and Earth where it does not apply. These are the great precepts. Thus, in serving one’s parents, one finds peace without choosing the place—this is the utmost of filial piety. In serving one’s lord, one finds peace without choosing the task—this is the height of loyalty. In serving one’s own mind, to remain unmoved by joy or sorrow before what lies ahead, to know what cannot be helped and find peace in it as fate—this is the utmost of power. As a minister and child, one is fundamentally bound by what cannot be avoided. To act according to the truth of affairs while forgetting oneself—how could one have leisure to delight in life and fear death? Your conduct, sir, is exemplary.\n\nLet me repeat what I have heard: In close dealings, one must be worn smooth by trust; in distant dealings, one must be loyal in speech, for speech may be transmitted. Transmitting words of mutual joy or mutual anger is the most difficult thing in the world. Where there is mutual joy, there is much exaggerated praise; where there is mutual anger, there is much exaggerated slander. All exaggeration is falsehood; falsehood destroys trust, and the destruction of trust brings calamity to the transmitter. Thus, the standard teaching says: Transmit the constant truth, do not transmit exaggerated words—then you will be near to wholeness.\n\nMoreover, those who contend with skill and force begin in brightness but often end in darkness; when excess prevails, there is much cunning. Those who drink wine with ritual begin in order but often end in chaos; when excess prevails, there is much strange delight. All affairs are like this: they begin in good faith but often end in baseness. What starts simply will surely become vast. Words are like wind and waves; actions are like gain and loss. Wind and waves are easily stirred; gain and loss are easily endangered. Thus, anger arises without cause, and clever words lead to biased speech. When beasts die, they do not choose their cries; their gasping breath is desperate, and from this arises a heart of cruelty. When scrutiny is too severe, there will surely be an unworthy heart to respond, though one does not know why. If one does not know why, who can know how it will end? Thus, the standard teaching says: Do not alter commands, do not urge completion—excess leads to transgression. Altering commands and urging completion endanger affairs. Beauty is achieved in duration; evil, once done, cannot be undone. Can one not be cautious?\n\nTo ride things with a wandering mind, to entrust oneself to the unavoidable to nurture the center—this is perfection. What need is there for action in return? It is best to convey the charge faithfully—this is the difficult part.'\n\nYan Wei was about to be sent to transmit the heir apparent of Duke Ling of Wei. He asked Lian Boyu, 'There is a man here whose power is Heaven’s executioner. To deal with him without method endangers our state; to deal with him with method endangers myself.'\"",

      "translated_text": "Is there not indeed a teaching without words, a shaping of the heart without form? What manner of man is this?\n\nConfucius said, \"This Master is a sage. I am but a latecomer who has yet to follow him. I shall take him as my teacher—how much more should those who are not my equal! Why limit ourselves to Lu? I shall lead all under Heaven to follow him.\"\n\nChang Ji said, \"He is a man without feet, yet he surpasses even a king. How far he stands above the common! If this is so, how does he employ his mind?\"\n\nConfucius said, \"Life and death are great matters, yet they do not alter him. Though heaven and earth should collapse, he would not be lost with them. He examines what is without artifice and does not shift with things. He governs the transformations of things while holding fast to their root.\"\n\nChang Ji said, \"What do you mean?\"\n\nConfucius said, \"Viewed from what makes them different, the liver and gallbladder are as distant as Chu and Yue. Viewed from what makes them the same, the myriad things are all one. One who is thus does not know what the ears and eyes deem fitting but roams the mind in the harmony of virtue. He sees what unites things and does not see what they lose. To him, the loss of a foot is like the shedding of dust.\"\n\nChang Ji said, \"He cultivates himself through his understanding, attains his heart through his heart. Having attained his constant heart, why do things gather to him?\"\n\nConfucius said, \"Men do not mirror themselves in flowing water but in still water. Only stillness can still the many. Endowed by earth, only the pine and cypress remain green in winter and summer. Endowed by heaven, only Shun was upright. Fortunate to have upright life, he set others upright. The proof of preserving the beginning lies in fearlessness. A single brave warrior can charge into nine armies. Those who seek fame and bind themselves to it are like this—how much more one who governs heaven and earth, stores the myriad things, treats the six senses as mere lodging, takes the ears and eyes as mere images, unifies knowledge with what is known, and whose heart never dies! He will choose a day to ascend to the heights, and men will follow him. How could he deign to make things his concern?\"\n\nShentu Jia, a man without feet, studied with Zheng Zichan under Bohun Wuren. Zichan said to Shentu Jia, \"If I go out first, you stay; if you go out first, I will stay.\" The next day, they again sat together in the same hall. Zichan said to Shentu Jia, \"If I go out first, you stay; if you go out first, I will stay. Now I am about to go out—can you stay, or not? Moreover, when you see the one in power, you do not avoid him. Do you consider yourself his equal?\"\n\nShentu Jia said, \"In the Master’s gate, are there truly those in power like this? Do you delight in your position of power and look down on others? I have heard that when a mirror is bright, dust does not settle; if it settles, it is not bright. When one dwells long with the worthy, one commits no faults. Now, what you value most is the Master, yet you still speak like this—is this not a fault?\"\n\nZichan said, \"You are already like this, yet you still vie with Yao in goodness. Do you not reflect that your virtue is insufficient?\"\n\nShentu Jia said, \"Those who justify their faults and claim they should not have lost are many; those who do not justify their faults and yet should not have perished are few. Knowing one cannot help but accept fate, only those with virtue can do so. Roaming within Yi’s bow casing, the center is the center of the earth, yet one may still miss—this is fate. Many are those with whole feet who laugh at my lack of feet. I would have raged, but when I came to the Master’s place, I was cast down and returned. Did the Master not wash me with goodness? I have followed you for nineteen years and never knew I was a man without feet. Now you roam with me within the form, yet you seek me outside the form—is this not a fault?\"\n\nZichan, startled, changed his expression and said, \"Say no more.\"\n\nIn Lu there was a man without toes named Shushan Wuzhi, who came to see Confucius on his heels. Confucius said, \"You were not careful and have already suffered such misfortune. Though you come now, what can be done?\"\n\nWuzhi said, \"I was ignorant of my duties and carelessly used my body, which is why I lost my foot. Now I come because what is more honorable than the foot still remains, and I strive to preserve it. Heaven covers all without exception; earth bears all without exception. I took you, Master, to be heaven and earth—how could I have known you would be like this?\"\n\nConfucius said, \"I am indeed narrow-minded. Why do you not enter? Let me expound what I have heard.\"\n\nWuzhi departed. Confucius said to his disciples, \"Strive! This Wuzhi, a man without feet, still strives to learn to make up for his past misdeeds—how much more should a man of full virtue!\"\n\nWuzhi said to Lao Dan, \"Is Confucius not far from the perfect man? Why does he persistently take learning as his guest? He seeks to be known for strange and fantastical fame, unaware that the perfect man regards this as fetters and shackles.\"\n\nLao Dan said, \"Why not simply lead him to see life and death as a single thread, the permissible and impermissible as one continuum, and thus free him from his fetters? Would that not suffice?\"\n\nWuzhi said, \"Heaven has punished him—how can it be undone?\"\n\nDuke Ai of Lu asked Confucius, \"In Wei there is an ugly man named Jifu Tuo. Men who live with him grow attached and cannot leave. Women who see him beg their parents, saying, ‘Rather than be another man’s wife, I would be this man’s concubine’—there are more than ten such cases. He never initiates speech but always harmonizes with others. He holds no lordly position to save men from death, nor wealth to fill men’s bellies. Moreover, he is ugly enough to startle all under heaven. He harmonizes but does not lead, and his knowledge does not extend beyond his domain. Yet men and women gather before him—he must possess something extraordinary.\"",

Those who followed him were as numerous as those who followed Confucius. Chang Ji asked Confucius, \"Wang Fu is a man without feet, yet those who follow him divide Lu equally with you. He stands without teaching, sits without discussing; yet those who go to him empty return full.\"",

      "translated_text": "Duke Ai summoned him and observed him, and indeed his ugliness startled all under heaven. Before even a month had passed in his company, the Duke took interest in his character; before a full year had elapsed, the Duke trusted him. When the state had no minister, the Duke offered him the throne. He responded with hesitation, and when he spoke, his words were vague. The Duke felt ashamed, yet ultimately entrusted him with the state. Soon after, he left the Duke and departed. The Duke grieved as though bereft, as if the state held no joy without him. What manner of man was this?\n\nConfucius said, \"I once traveled to Chu and happened upon a piglet nursing from its dead mother. After a moment, it shrank back in alarm and fled. It saw no self in her, no likeness to itself. What it loved in its mother was not her form but that which animated her form. Warriors who die in battle are buried without ritual finery; a man who loses his feet is no longer cherished for his shoes—both have lost their root. When the Son of Heaven selects his consorts, they are not to pare their nails or pierce their ears; once married, they are not sent on further errands. Even those whose forms remain whole are thus esteemed—how much more one whose virtue is whole? Now, this Jifu Tuo has won trust without speaking, affection without merit, and been offered a state, only fearing he might refuse. He must be one whose talents are complete and whose virtue remains unmanifest.\"\n\nDuke Ai asked, \"What does it mean for talents to be complete?\"\n\nConfucius said, \"Life and death, survival and ruin, poverty and wealth, worthiness and unworthiness, slander and praise, hunger and thirst, cold and heat—these are the changes of affairs, the workings of fate. They alternate day and night before us, yet knowledge cannot fathom their beginnings. Thus, they should not disturb harmony or enter the mind’s sanctuary. One who makes others joyful and at ease, who remains open without losing balance, who ensures day and night flow without stagnation, bringing springtime to all things—this is one whose heart connects and gives rise to the seasons. This is what it means for talents to be complete.\n\n\"What does it mean for virtue to remain unmanifest? Stillness is the fullness of settled water. It may serve as a model, for it preserves within while remaining undisturbed without. Virtue is the cultivation of perfect harmony. One whose virtue remains unmanifest cannot be separated from things.\"\n\nAnother day, Duke Ai told Minzi what he had heard: \"At first, I thought ruling the world from the southern throne, holding the people’s guiding principles and fearing their deaths, was the height of understanding. Now, hearing the words of a perfected person, I fear I lack true substance, that I have lightly used my body and lost my state. Between Confucius and me, there is no lord and minister—only a bond of virtue.\"\n\nMinjiao, the hunchbacked and lipless, advised Duke Ling of Wei, who delighted in him; yet when he saw whole men, their necks seemed frail. The potbellied and emaciated advised Duke Huan of Qi, who delighted in him; yet when he saw whole men, their necks seemed frail. Thus, virtue may excel while form is forgotten. Do men forget what should be forgotten and remember what should not? This is called true forgetting.\n\nTherefore, the sage wanders freely, where knowledge becomes a snare, covenants become glue, virtue becomes a bond, and skill becomes trade. The sage does not scheme—why use knowledge? Does not sever—why use glue? Suffers no loss—why use virtue? Engages in no commerce—why trade? These four are the fasting of heaven. Heaven’s fasting is heaven’s nourishment. Having received nourishment from heaven, why rely on man?\n\nOne may have the form of a man but lack human emotions. Having the form of a man, one mingles with others; lacking human emotions, right and wrong do not cling to one. How small and insignificant—this is how one belongs to mankind. How vast and great—this is how one completes heaven alone.\n\nHuizi said to Zhuangzi, \"Do men truly have no emotions?\"\n\nZhuangzi said, \"Yes.\"\n\nHuizi said, \"If a man has no emotions, how can he be called a man?\"\n\nZhuangzi said, \"The Dao gives him appearance, heaven gives him form—how can he not be called a man?\"\n\nHuizi said, \"If he is called a man, how can he have no emotions?\"\n\nZhuangzi said, \"This is not what I mean by emotions. What I call having no emotions is that a man does not inwardly harm his body with likes and dislikes, but constantly follows nature without adding to life.\"\n\nHuizi said, \"Without adding to life, how can one preserve one’s body?\"\n\nZhuangzi said, \"The Dao gives him appearance, heaven gives him form—do not inwardly harm your body with likes and dislikes. Now you exhaust your spirit externally, weary your essence, lean against a tree and chant, rest on a withered catalpa and doze. Heaven chose your form, yet you clamor about ‘hard’ and ‘white.’\"\n\n*The Classic of Southern Florescence, Scroll One ends here.*\n\n*The Classic of Southern Florescence, Scroll Two: Inner Chapters*\n**Chapter Six: The Teacher of the Dao**\n\nTo know what heaven does and what man does—this is perfection. To know what heaven does is to be born of heaven; to know what man does is to use what one’s knowledge knows to nourish what one’s knowledge does not know, thus fulfilling one’s heavenly years without dying prematurely. This is the fullness of knowledge.\n\nYet there is a danger. Knowledge depends on something to be correct, but what it depends on is inherently uncertain. How can we know that what I call heaven is not man, or what I call man is not heaven? Only when there is a true person is there true knowledge.\n\nWhat is a true person? The true persons of old did not resist the few, did not boast of success, did not scheme for office. Thus, they erred without regret and succeeded without self-satisfaction. Thus, they climbed heights without trembling, entered water without getting wet, entered fire without feeling heat. Their knowledge could ascend to the Dao in this way.\n\nThe true persons of old slept without dreaming, woke without worry, ate without relishing, and breathed deeply. True persons breathed from their heels, while ordinary people breathe from their throats. Those who are forced to submit speak as though choking. Those whose desires run deep have shallow heavenly mechanisms.",

      "translated_text": "The true persons of old knew neither delight in life nor aversion to death. Their departure brought no joy, their return no resistance; they simply went lightly away and came lightly back. They did not forget their beginning nor seek their end. They received life with delight and forgot it to return—this is what it means not to use the mind to cast aside the Dao, not to use man to aid heaven. This is called the true person.\n\nSuch a one’s mind is serene, their countenance still, their brow tranquil. Cold as autumn, warm as spring, their joy and anger flow with the four seasons, harmonizing with things yet no one knows their limit. Thus, when the sage employs arms, they may destroy a state yet lose no hearts. Their beneficence extends through ten thousand generations, yet they do not act out of love for others. Therefore, one who delights in harmonizing with things is no sage; one who has partiality is not benevolent; one who follows the seasons is not worthy; one who does not comprehend profit and harm is no gentleman; one who acts for fame and loses the self is no scholar; one who destroys the self yet is not true is no servant of others.\n\nThose like Hu Buxie, Wu Guang, Boyi, Shuqi, Jizi, Xuyu, Ji Ta, and Shentu Di—these are servants of others’ service, followers of others’ paths, unable to follow their own. The true persons of old bore righteousness yet did not form cliques, seemed insufficient yet did not seek fulfillment. They were yielding yet not weak, expansive yet not ostentatious. Their demeanor was joyful yet solemn, their actions seemed compelled. Their presence softened my countenance, their virtue stilled my power. They were stern as the world, yet untamable; connected as though fond of seclusion, yet their words were forgotten. They took punishment as their body, ritual as their wings, knowledge as their timing, and virtue as their guide.\n\nTaking punishment as their body, they were resolute in execution. Taking ritual as their wings, they moved through the world. Taking knowledge as their timing, they acted only when compelled. Taking virtue as their guide, they spoke as though reaching hills with those who have feet—yet others truly believed them to be diligent in conduct. Thus, their preferences were unified, and their aversions were unified. Their unity was one, and their disunity was one. Those who were one followed heaven; those who were not one followed man. Heaven and man do not overcome one another—this is called the true person.\n\nLife and death are fate, as constant as night and day—this is heaven. What man cannot partake in is the nature of things. They take heaven as their father and love it still—how much more that which transcends it? They take having a lord as better than themselves and die for it still—how much more that which is true?\n\nWhen springs dry, fish find themselves on land, wetting one another with their breath, moistening one another with their foam—better to forget one another in rivers and lakes. Rather than praising Yao and condemning Jie, it is better to forget both and be transformed by the Dao.\n\nThe great clod burdens me with form, labors me with life, eases me with old age, and rests me with death. Thus, to be good to my life is to be good to my death. Hiding a boat in a ravine or a mountain in a marsh seems secure, yet in the dead of night, a strong man may carry them away, and the unaware do not know. Hiding the small and large appropriately still leaves room for delay. But to hide the world within the world leaves no room for delay—this is the great truth of things.\n\nEven those who cherish their human form—if the human form is but one of ten thousand transformations yet to reach their limit, how immeasurable must their joy be? Thus, the sage wanders where things cannot delay and all endure. To be good at early death and old age, at beginnings and endings—people emulate this, let alone that on which the ten thousand things depend and the one transformation awaits.\n\nThe Dao has essence and trustworthiness, yet is without action or form. It can be transmitted but not received, attained but not seen. It is self-originating, self-rooted, existing before heaven and earth, enduring since ancient times. It spirits forth ghosts and gods, gives birth to heaven and earth. It is before the Supreme Ultimate yet not high, below the Six Directions yet not deep. It preceded heaven and earth yet is not ancient, older than antiquity yet not aged.\n\nXiwei obtained it and thereby lifted heaven and earth. Fuxi obtained it and thereby embraced the mother of qi. The Northern Dipper obtained it and has never faltered since. The sun and moon obtained it and have never ceased. Kanpi obtained it and thereby embraced Kunlun. Feng Yi obtained it and thereby roamed the great rivers. Jian Wu obtained it and thereby dwelt on Mount Tai. The Yellow Emperor obtained it and thereby ascended to the cloudy heavens. Zhuanxu obtained it and thereby dwelt in the Dark Palace. Yuqiang obtained it and stood at the North Pole. The Queen Mother of the West obtained it and sat in Shaoguang. None know its beginning, none know its end.\n\nPengzu obtained it, reaching from the time of Yu to the Five Hegemons. Fu Yue obtained it and served Wu Ding, ruling all under heaven, riding the tail of the Eastern Well and the handle of the Dipper, ranking among the stars.\n\nNanbo Zigui asked Nü Ou, “You are advanced in years, yet your complexion is like a child’s. How is this?” He replied, “I have heard the Dao.” Nanbo Zigui said, “Can the Dao be learned?” He said, “No. How could it? You are not the right person. Bu Liangyi has the talent of a sage but not the Dao of a sage. I have the Dao of a sage but not the talent of a sage. I wished to teach him, hoping he might truly become a sage. If not, teaching the Dao of a sage to one with the talent of a sage would be easy. I still guarded and taught him. After three days, he was able to put the world outside himself. Once he had put the world outside, I guarded him again. After seven days, he was able to put things outside himself. Once he had put things outside, I guarded him again. After nine days, he was able to put life outside himself.”",

The imbalance of yin and yang qi has thrown you into disorder, yet your heart remains at ease, untroubled. Leaning on your staff, you gaze into the well and sigh, “Ah! Would the Creator make me thus confined and deformed?”\n\nZisi said, “Do you resent this?”\nHe replied, “No, why should I resent it? If, little by little, my left arm were transformed into a rooster, I would use it to herald the dawn. If, little by little, my right arm were transformed into a crossbow, I would use it to hunt for roasted magpie. If, little by little, my body were transformed into a wheel, and my spirit into a horse, I would mount it—why ever change steeds? Moreover, what comes is timely; what goes is fitting. To rest in timeliness and abide in fittingness, neither joy nor sorrow can enter. This is what the ancients called ‘suspended release,’ yet those who cannot release themselves are bound by things. For long now, things have not overcome Heaven—why should I resent it?”\n\nSoon after, Zilai fell ill, gasping as if near death. His wife and children gathered around, weeping. Zili went to inquire after him and cried, “Shoo! Away! Do not disturb his transformation.” Leaning against the doorframe, he said to him, “How wondrous is the Creator! What will it make of you next? Where will it send you? Will it make you into a rat’s liver? A bug’s arm?”\n\nZilai replied, “Wherever a child goes—east, west, south, or north—he follows his parents’ command. Yin and yang are to man no less than parents. If they press me toward death and I resist, I would be obstinate—what fault would be theirs? The great earth burdens me with form, labors me with life, eases me with old age, and rests me with death. Thus, to make my life good is to make my death good. Now, if a great smith were casting metal, and the metal leapt up, crying, ‘I must become a Moye sword!’ the smith would surely deem it ill-omened metal. Now, if one were to assume human form and cry, ‘A human! A human!’ the Creator would surely deem him an ill-omened man.

Before he was buried, Confucius, hearing of it, sent Zigong to assist with the rites. One wove a song, another strummed the zither, and together they sang in harmony:\n“Ah, Zisang Hu!\nAh, Zisang Hu!\nYou have returned to your true nature,\nWhile I remain a mere man.”\n\nZigong hurried forward and said, “May I ask whether singing before the corpse accords with ritual?”\nThe two looked at each other and smiled, saying, “What does he know of the meaning of ritual?”\n\nZigong returned and reported to Confucius, saying, “What sort of men are they?

Lacking these three, he was yet praised throughout Lu for his mastery of mourning. Is it truly possible to gain a name without the reality? I find it most strange.”\nConfucius said, “Mengsun has exhausted the matter—he has advanced beyond knowledge. Though he sought to simplify, he could not; yet he has already simplified. Mengsun does not know why he lives, nor why he dies; he does not know what to pursue first, nor what to pursue later. Transformed into a thing, he awaits whatever transformations he does not yet know. And even as he is about to transform, how could he know that he will not transform? Even as he is about to remain unchanged, how could he know that he has not already transformed? You and I are but dreamers who have not yet awakened. Moreover, he may be startled by a change in form, but his heart remains unharmed; he may dwell in a new abode, but his essence does not die. Mengsun alone is awake—others weep, so he weeps too; that is simply his nature. Besides, we all call this ‘I’ of ours ‘I,’ but how do we know what we mean by ‘our I’? You may dream you are a bird soaring in the sky, or a fish diving into the deep. But do you know whether the one speaking now is awake or dreaming? When joy comes, you cannot laugh in time; when laughter comes, you cannot arrange it. Accept the arrangement and follow transformation—then you enter the vast oneness of Heaven.”\n\nYi’erzi went to see Xu You.\nXu You said, “What did Yao give you?”\nYi’erzi said, “Yao told me, ‘You must personally practice benevolence and righteousness and clearly distinguish right and wrong.’”\nXu You said, “Then why have you come? Yao has already branded you with benevolence and righteousness and mutilated you with right and wrong—how will you wander the paths of carefree, uninhibited, and ever-shifting freedom?”\nYi’erzi said, “Even so, I wish to roam within their bounds.”\nXu You said, “Not so. The blind cannot appreciate the beauty of brows and eyes; the colorblind cannot distinguish blue and yellow. Yi’erzi said, “Yet Wu Zhuang lost her beauty, Ju Liang lost his strength, and the Yellow Emperor lost his knowledge—all in the space of the forge and hammer. How do we know the Creator will not remove my brands and mend my mutilations, allowing me to ride perfection and follow you, Master?”\nXu You said, “Ah, who can say? Let me tell you the general idea. My teacher! My teacher! He slays the myriad things yet is not cruel; his blessings reach ten thousand generations yet he is not benevolent. Older than high antiquity, he is not aged; he covers and bears heaven and earth, carves and shapes all forms, yet is not skillful.

Yet his voice could not bear the strain, and so he hastened to recite his verse.”\n\nYan Yu entered and asked, “Why do you sing your poem in this manner?”\n\nZi Sang replied, “I ponder who has brought me to this extremity, yet I cannot find the answer. Would my parents wish me to be poor? Heaven covers all without partiality; earth bears all without favor. Would heaven and earth single me out for poverty? I seek the one who has done this, yet I cannot find him. Nevertheless, to reach this extremity—this is fate, is it not?”\n\nNie Que questioned Wang Ni four times, and four times Wang Ni professed ignorance. Thereupon Nie Que leapt up in great joy and went to tell Master Pu Yi.\n\nMaster Pu Yi said, “Have you only now come to know this? The Lord of Yu fell short, yet in his awakening he was all-pervasive, at times taking himself for a horse, at times for an ox. His knowledge was true to his nature, his virtue most genuine, and he had never entered the realm of man.”\n\nJian Wu met Jie Yu the Madman. Jie Yu asked, “What did Ri Zhongshi tell you at noon?”\n\nJian Wu replied, “He told me that a ruler of men must issue decrees, standards, principles, and measures from himself—who would dare not obey and be transformed?”\n\nJie Yu said, “This is deceptive virtue. In governing the world, it is like crossing the sea by digging a river or making a flea carry a mountain. Does the sage’s governance concern externals? He rectifies himself and then acts, merely ensuring that those capable of the task can fulfill it. Moreover, the bird flies high to avoid the harm of nets and arrows, while the mole digs deep beneath the sacred mound to escape the calamity of pitfalls—yet you would call these two creatures ignorant?”\n\nTian Gen was wandering at Yin Yang when he came to the banks of the Liao River. There he encountered an unnamed man and asked him, “May I inquire about governing the world?”\n\nThe unnamed man said, “Begone! You are a vulgar man—why do you ask such an inopportune question? I am about to become one with the Creator. When weary, I shall ride the nebulous bird beyond the six directions and wander in the land of Nothing Whatever, dwelling in the boundless wilds. Why do you disturb my heart with talk of governing the world?”\n\nTian Gen asked again.\n\nThe unnamed man replied, “Let your mind wander in simplicity, blend your qi with the vastness, follow things as they are without imposing your private will—and the world will be governed.”\n\nYang Ziju met Lao Dan and said, “Here is a man swift, strong, and resolute, with keen perception and clear understanding, who studies the Dao tirelessly. Could such a one be compared to an enlightened king?”\n\nLao Dan replied, “In the eyes of the sage, such a man is like a clerk or artisan, bound by skill and toil, exhausting his body and straining his mind. Moreover, the patterns of tigers and leopards attract hunters, while the agility of monkeys and the cunning of dogs trained to catch rats bring them to the leash. Could such a one be compared to an enlightened king?”\n\nYang Ziju, startled, asked, “May I inquire about the governance of an enlightened king?”\n\nLao Dan said, “The achievements of an enlightened king cover the world yet seem not his own; he transforms and bestows upon the ten thousand things, yet the people do not rely on him. No name is raised, and he allows things to rejoice in themselves. He stands in the unfathomable and wanders in the realm of Nothing.”",

      "translated_text": "In Zheng there was a divine diviner named Ji Xian, who knew of men’s deaths and lives, survivals and perishings, fortunes and misfortunes, long lives and early deaths, predicting them by the year, month, ten-day week, or day, as if by spirit. When the people of Zheng saw him, they all fled in haste. Liezi saw him and was enchanted in heart. Returning, he told Master Hu, saying, “At first I took your Dao as the ultimate, but now there is something even more ultimate.”\n\nMaster Hu said, “I have shown you only its form, not yet its reality—do you truly possess the Dao? Though many hens may gather, without a rooster how can they lay fertile eggs? You take your seclusion and contend with the world, so you must be genuine, which is why others can read your fortune. Try bringing him here to show him me.”\n\nThe next day, Liezi brought Ji Xian to see Master Hu. When they came out, Ji Xian said to Liezi, “Alas! Your master is dead—he will not live. Not even ten days remain. I saw something strange in him, like damp ashes.”\n\nLiezi entered and wept, his tears soaking his lapels, as he told Master Hu. Master Hu said, “I showed him the pattern of earth—still and unshaken, neither moving nor upright. He likely saw my blocked virtue-mechanism. Try bringing him again.”\n\nThe next day, Liezi brought Ji Xian to see Master Hu again. When they came out, Ji Xian said to Liezi, “Fortunate that your master met me! He is restored—fully alive. I saw his blocked potential.”\n\nLiezi entered and told Master Hu. Master Hu said, “I showed him the expanse of heaven and earth—names and realities did not enter, yet the mechanism arose from his heels. He likely saw my mechanism of goodness. Try bringing him again.”\n\nThe next day, Liezi brought Ji Xian to see Master Hu again. When they came out, Ji Xian said to Liezi, “Your master is unsettled—I cannot read his fortune. If he settles, I will try again.”\n\nLiezi entered and told Master Hu. Master Hu said, “I humbly showed him the Great Thoroughfare where nothing prevails. He likely saw my balanced qi-mechanism. The stillness of a deep ravine forms a profound abyss; the stillness of water forms a profound abyss; the flow of water forms a profound abyss. There are nine names for abyss—here he saw three. Try bringing him again.”\n\nThe next day, Liezi brought Ji Xian to see Master Hu again. Before he could stand steadily, Ji Xian lost himself and fled. Master Hu said, “Pursue him.”\n\nLiezi chased him but could not catch up. Returning, he reported to Master Hu, “He has vanished—he is gone. I could not reach him.”\n\nMaster Hu said, “I showed him what had never yet departed from my origin. I met him with emptiness and compliance, not knowing who or what he was. He took me for a drifting gourd, for a flowing wave—hence his flight.”\n\nAfter this, Liezi considered himself as one who had never yet begun to learn. He returned home and for three years did not go out. He cooked for his wife, fed pigs as if feeding people, and in affairs kept no special closeness. He carved away excess and returned to simplicity, standing alone in his form like an unworked clod. Entangled yet sealed, he ended thus. He became no vessel for fame, no repository for schemes, no bearer of tasks, no master of knowledge. His body embraced the boundless, and he wandered without trace. He exhausted what he received from heaven yet saw no gain—he was merely empty. The mind of the perfected man is like a mirror: it does not send forth, does not welcome, responds yet does not store, and thus can master things without harm.\n\nThe emperor of the Southern Sea was Shu, the emperor of the Northern Sea was Hu, and the emperor of the Central Sea was Hundun. Shu and Hu often met in Hundun’s land, and Hundun treated them very well. Shu and Hu plotted to repay Hundun’s kindness, saying, “All people have seven openings for seeing, hearing, eating, and breathing—only he has none. Let us try to bore them for him.” Each day they bored one opening, and on the seventh day, Hundun died.\n\n*Chapter Eight of the Outer Chapters of the True Scripture of Southern Florescence: \"Webbed Toes\"*\n\nWebbed toes and extra fingers arise from nature yet exceed in virtue; hanging tumors and dangling warts arise from form yet exceed in nature. Those who multiply methods of benevolence and righteousness and apply them are arrayed among the five organs, yet this is not the true standard of the Dao. Thus, webbing in the feet is but connected useless flesh; branching in the hands is but an extra useless finger. Those who multiply methods and branch out in the passions of the five organs indulge in perverse practices of benevolence and righteousness and multiply the uses of intelligence. Thus, those with webbing in their vision confuse the five colors, indulge in ornate patterns, and dazzle with blues, yellows, and fish-scale brilliance—is this not Li Zhu? Those with branching in their hearing confuse the five sounds, indulge in the six pitches, and resound with metal, stone, silk, bamboo, the Yellow Bell, and the Great Regulator—is this not Shi Kuang? Those who branch in benevolence pluck at virtue and block their nature to gather fame, making the world drum up support for unattainable laws—are these not Zeng and Shi? Those with webbing in their eloquence weave tangled knots of words, roaming their minds among the questions of hardness and whiteness, sameness and difference, and exhaust jade-like reputations with useless speech—are these not Yang and Mo? Thus, all these are paths of excess webbing and branching, not the ultimate standard of the world. That which is truly upright does not lose the truth of its nature and life. Therefore, what is joined is not called webbing, and what branches is not called divergence; what is long is not called excess, and what is short is not called deficiency. Thus, the duck’s legs are short, but lengthening them would cause sorrow; the crane’s legs are long, but cutting them would cause grief. Therefore, what is long by nature should not be cut, and what is short by nature should not be lengthened—there is no need to remove sorrow. Do benevolence and righteousness truly not accord with human nature? Why do those benevolent people have so many worries? Moreover, those with webbed toes feel pain when separated, and those with extra fingers cry when pinched. These two—whether in excess or deficiency in number—share the same sorrow. The benevolent people of today gaze with concern at the world’s calamities; the unbenevolent people harm their nature and life to glut themselves on wealth and honor.",

      "translated_text": "Thus, do benevolence and righteousness truly not accord with human nature? Since the Three Dynasties and below, why has the world been so clamorous? Moreover, those who rely on hooks, cords, compasses, and squares to make things straight cut away at their nature; those who depend on ropes, glue, and lacquer to make things firm encroach upon their virtue. Bending and folding with rites and music, mouthing benevolence and righteousness to soothe the hearts of the world—this is to lose what is constant and natural. The world has its constant and natural state. In this state, the crooked need no hook, the straight need no cord, the round need no compass, the square need no square, adhesion requires no glue or lacquer, and binding needs no rope. Thus, the world is born in harmony, all living yet not knowing why they live, all attaining yet not knowing why they attain. From ancient times to the present, this has never changed—it cannot be diminished. Then why do benevolence and righteousness cling like glue and lacquer, entangle like ropes, and wander between the Dao and virtue? They only confuse the world.\n\nMinor delusions distort direction; great delusions distort nature. How do we know this is so? Since the time of Yu’s dynasty, when benevolence and righteousness were promoted to disturb the world, all under heaven have rushed to answer the call of benevolence and righteousness—is this not using benevolence and righteousness to alter their nature? Let us examine this: since the Three Dynasties and below, has there been anyone in the world who has not exchanged their nature for external things?\n\nThe petty man sacrifices himself for profit; the scholar sacrifices himself for fame; the grandee sacrifices himself for his family; the sage sacrifices himself for the world. Though these several types differ in their undertakings and their reputations bear different names, in harming their nature and sacrificing themselves, they are one.\n\nZang and Gu were two men who herded sheep together, yet both lost their sheep. When asked what Zang was doing, he was holding books and reading; when asked what Gu was doing, he was gambling for sport. Though their occupations differed, in losing their sheep they were the same.\n\nBoyi died for fame beneath Shouyang Mountain, while Robber Zhi died for profit atop Dongling. Though their deaths differed, in harming their lives and injuring their natures they were the same. Why must Boyi be right and Robber Zhi wrong? The world is entirely given to sacrifice: those who sacrifice for benevolence and righteousness are called gentlemen by custom; those who sacrifice for wealth and property are called petty men. In their sacrifice, they are one—some are gentlemen, some are petty men. But if we consider the harm to their lives and the injury to their natures, then Robber Zhi is no different from Boyi. How then can we distinguish between gentleman and petty man?\n\nMoreover, those who bind their nature to benevolence and righteousness, though as learned as Zeng and Shi, are not what I call good; those who bind their nature to the five flavors, though as skilled as Yu’er, are not what I call good; those who bind their nature to the five sounds, though as perceptive as Master Kuang, are not what I call keen; those who bind their nature to the five colors, though as discerning as Li Zhu, are not what I call clear-sighted.\n\nWhat I call good is not the so-called benevolence and righteousness, but preserving one’s virtue alone. What I call good is not the so-called benevolence and righteousness, but preserving one’s virtue alone. What I call good is not the so-called benevolence and righteousness, but following the true nature of one’s life. What I call keen is not hearing others, but hearing oneself; what I call clear-sighted is not seeing others, but seeing oneself.\n\nThose who do not see themselves but see others, who do not attain for themselves but attain for others—these attain what others attain yet do not attain what they themselves attain, they follow what others follow yet do not follow what they themselves follow. Whether Robber Zhi or Boyi, those who follow what others follow and do not follow what they themselves follow are equally excessive and perverse.\n\nI am ashamed before the Dao and virtue, and so above I dare not practice the conduct of benevolence and righteousness, and below I dare not engage in excessive and perverse actions.\n\n*Southern Florescence Perfected Scripture, Scroll Two, Outer Chapters: \"Horse’s Hooves\" (Chapter Nine)*\n\nA horse’s hooves can tread upon frost and snow; its hair can resist wind and cold.

      "translated_text": "To burn and brand them, to pare and carve them, to bind them with bridles and reins, to confine them with early-morning stalls—of horses thus treated, twelve or thirteen in every twenty die. To starve them, to parch them, to drive them at a gallop, to spur them to a run, to marshal them in ranks, to align them in formation, with the peril of elaborate trappings before them and the threat of whips and lashes behind—of horses thus treated, more than half die.\n\nThe potter says, “I am skilled in shaping clay: round vessels meet the compass, square ones meet the carpenter’s square.” The craftsman says, “I am skilled in shaping wood: curved pieces meet the hook, straight ones meet the plumb line.” But do clay and wood by nature desire to meet compass, square, hook, and plumb line? Yet generation after generation praises them, saying, “Bo Le is skilled in managing horses, and potters and carpenters are skilled in shaping clay and wood.” This is also the error of those who govern the world.\n\nIn my view, those who are truly skilled in governing the world do not act thus. The people have a constant nature: they weave to clothe themselves, they plow to feed themselves—this is called shared virtue. Unified yet not partisan, this is called “Heaven’s release.” Thus in the age of utmost virtue, their movements were unhurried, their gazes were steady. At that time, mountains had no paths or tunnels, marshes had no boats or bridges. The myriad things thrived in flocks, linked to their native lands. Birds and beasts gathered in herds, grasses and trees grew to fullness. Thus one could lead birds and beasts by the halter and wander with them, or climb to the nests of crows and magpies and peer inside. In the age of utmost virtue, people dwelled together with birds and beasts, lived in kinship with the myriad things. How would they know of gentlemen and petty men? Alike in their lack of knowledge, their virtue did not depart; alike in their lack of desire, they were called “plain and unhewn.” In plainness and unhewn simplicity, the people’s nature was preserved.\n\nBut when the sages came, they trod and trampled to create benevolence, they lifted and prodded to create righteousness—and the world began to doubt. They spread and scattered to create music, they picked and selected to create ritual—and the world began to divide. Thus if the unhewn block is not carved, who would make sacrificial goblets? If white jade is not cut, who would make ritual scepters? If the Dao and virtue are not abandoned, why would one need benevolence and righteousness? If nature and feeling are not estranged, why would one need ritual and music? If the five colors are not confused, who would create patterned embroidery? If the five notes are not disordered, who would tune them to the six pitch-pipes? To carve the unhewn into vessels is the fault of the craftsman; to destroy the Dao and virtue to create benevolence and righteousness is the error of the sage.\n\nThe horse, dwelling on land, eats grass and drinks water; when pleased, it nuzzles necks with its companions; when angry, it turns its back and kicks. This is all the horse knows. But when one adds a crossbar and yoke, aligns it with blinkers, the horse learns to feign submission, to balk at the bit, to startle and bolt, to cheat the bridle, to steal the reins. Thus the horse’s knowledge, able to reach the point of theft, is the fault of Bo Le.\n\nIn the time of the Lord of Brightness, the people dwelled without knowing what to do, wandered without knowing where to go. They carried food in their cheeks and played, patted their bellies and roamed—this was all the people could do. But when the sages came, they bent and twisted ritual and music to correct the world’s form, they hung up benevolence and righteousness to console the world’s heart—and the people then began to tread the byways of cunning and love of knowledge, to contend in pursuit of profit, unable to stop. This, too, is the error of the sages.\n\n*Southern Florescence Perfected Scripture, Scroll Two, Outer Chapters: \"The Collar-Basket\" (Chapter Ten)*\n\nIf one prepares locks, cords, and sturdy bolts to guard against thieves who would pry open baskets, rummage through bags, or break into chests, this is what the world calls wisdom. Yet when the great thief comes, he shoulders the chest, lifts the basket, carries the bag, and flees—fearing only that the cords, locks, and bolts are not secure enough. Thus what was formerly called wisdom is nothing but amassing goods for the great thief.\n\nLet me try to discuss this: Is there anything in what the world calls wisdom that does not amass for the great thief? Is there anything in what it calls sagacity that does not guard for the great thief? How do I know this is so? In ancient times, the state of Qi had villages so close they could see one another, and the sounds of their chickens and dogs could be heard across the land. The area where nets and traps were spread, where plows and hoes were used, extended over three thousand *li* square. Within its four borders, in all its ancestral temples, altars of soil and grain, cities, towns, districts, and villages—was there any place where they did not model themselves on the sages? Yet one morning, Tian Chengzi killed the ruler of Qi and stole his state. What he stole was not merely the state—he also stole the sagely laws along with it. Thus though Tian Chengzi bore the name of a thief and bandit, he lived in the security of Yao and Shun. Small states dared not criticize him, great states dared not punish him, and for twelve generations he held the state of Qi. Was this not stealing the state of Qi along with its sagely laws to guard his thieving body?\n\nLet me try to discuss this: Is there anything in what the world calls supreme wisdom that does not amass for the great thief? Is there anything in what it calls supreme sagacity that does not guard for the great thief? How do I know this is so? In ancient times, Guan Longpeng was beheaded, Bi Gan was disemboweled, Chang Hong was torn apart, and Wu Zixu was torn to shreds. Thus though these four were worthy men, they could not escape execution.\n\nA disciple asked Robber Zhi, “Do thieves also have a Dao?” Robber Zhi said, “Where can one go without a Dao? To guess the treasures hidden in a room is sagacity; to enter first is courage; to leave last is righteousness; to know whether it can be done is knowledge; to divide the spoils equally is benevolence. Without these five, no one in the world has ever become a great thief.”\n\nFrom this we see that the good man cannot stand without the Dao of the sage, and Robber Zhi cannot act without the Dao of the sage. Since there are few good men in the world and many who are not good, the sage brings little benefit to the world and much harm. Thus it is said: When the lips are gone, the teeth grow cold; when the wine of Lu was weak, the city of Handan was besieged; when sages arise, great thieves appear. Strike down the sages, release the thieves and bandits—and the world will begin to be ordered.\n\nWhen rivers run dry, valleys empty; when hills are leveled, deep pools fill. When the sages die, great thieves will not arise, and the world will be at peace, without trouble.",

      "translated_text": "If the sage does not die, great thieves will not cease. Though one may exalt the sage to govern the world, this is but to heap profit upon Robber Zhi. When measures and pecks are made to gauge, he steals both measure and peck; when scales and balances are made to weigh, he steals both scale and balance; when tallies and seals are made to authenticate, he steals both tally and seal; when benevolence and righteousness are made to rectify, he steals both benevolence and righteousness. How do we know this is so? He who steals a hook is executed, but he who steals a state becomes a feudal lord—benevolence and righteousness abide at the gates of such lords. Is this not the theft of benevolence, righteousness, sagacity, and wisdom? Thus, those who pursue great thieves, usurp the ranks of feudal lords, and seize the profits of benevolence, righteousness, measures, scales, tallies, and seals—even with the rewards of high office, none can be encouraged; even with the threat of the executioner’s axe, none can be restrained. This heaping of profit for Robber Zhi, making him unstoppable, is the fault of the sage.\n\nThus it is said: The fish must not leave the deep; the state’s sharpest tools must not be shown to others. The sage is the world’s sharpest tool—he is not what should be displayed to the world. Therefore, cut off sagacity and cast aside wisdom, and great thieves will cease; smash jade and shatter pearls, and petty thieves will not arise; burn tallies and break seals, and the people will return to simplicity; discard measures and snap balances, and the people will know no contention. Only after destroying the world’s sagely laws can the people be fit for discussion. Throw the six pitch-pipes into chaos, melt down flutes and zithers, deafen the ears of Master Kuang, and the world will begin to set aside its hearing; erase patterns, scatter the five colors, blind the eyes of Li Zhu, and the world will begin to set aside its sight; break hooks and cords, discard compass and square, cripple the fingers of the artisan Chui, and the world will begin to possess its skill. Thus it is said: Great skill appears clumsy.\n\nErase the conduct of Zeng and Shi, silence the mouths of Yang and Mo, cast aside benevolence and righteousness, and the world’s virtue will begin to attain profound unity. When people contain their brightness, the world will not be dazzled; when people set aside their hearing, the world will not be burdened; when people contain their knowledge, the world will not be deluded; when people contain their virtue, the world will not be perverse. Those like Zeng, Shi, Yang, Mo, Master Kuang, the artisan Chui, and Li Zhu—all externally establish their virtue and thereby confuse the world—are of no use to the law.\n\nDo you alone not know of the age of perfect virtue? In ancient times, under the reigns of Rongcheng, Dating, Bohuang, Zhongyang, Lilu, Lixu, Xuanyuan, Hexu, Zunlu, Zhurong, Fuxi, and Shennong, the people knotted cords to keep records. They savored their food, admired their clothing, delighted in their customs, and rested content in their dwellings. Neighboring states were within sight of one another, the sounds of chickens and dogs carried between them, yet the people grew old and died without ever traveling beyond their lands. In such an age, perfect governance was already achieved.\n\nBut now, it has come to this: the people crane their necks and stand on tiptoe, saying, “In such-and-such a place there is a worthy one,” and they carry provisions to flock there—abandoning their parents at home and forsaking their lords’ service abroad.",

      "translated_text": "Their footprints tread upon the borders of the lords’ domains, and the ruts of their chariots entangle a thousand *li* beyond—all because those above are excessively fond of knowledge. If those above truly cherish knowledge while lacking the Dao, the world will fall into great chaos.\n\nHow do we know this is so? When the cunning of bows, crossbows, snares, and traps multiplies, birds are thrown into turmoil above. When the schemes of hooks, baits, nets, and weirs proliferate, fish are thrown into turmoil in the waters. When the devices of fences, nets, and pitfall traps grow numerous, beasts are thrown into turmoil in the marshes. When the deceptions of crafty deceit, poisonous sophistry, and the disputes over \"hard and white\" or \"same and different\" abound, the common folk are bewildered by rhetoric.\n\nThus, the world repeatedly falls into great chaos, and the fault lies in the love of knowledge. For the world all knows to seek what it does not know, yet none knows to seek what it already knows; all knows to condemn what it deems unworthy, yet none knows to condemn what it already deems worthy. This is why great chaos arises.\n\nAbove, it eclipses the brightness of the sun and moon; below, it scorches the essence of mountains and rivers; in between, it disrupts the unfolding of the four seasons. Even the creatures that crawl and flutter—none retain their true nature. How severe is the disorder wrought by the love of knowledge upon the world! This has been the case since the Three Dynasties and beyond: abandoning the simple and unadorned people, they delight in the toiling flattery of the obsequious. Forsaking tranquil non-action, they take pleasure in the restless clamor of cleverness—this restless clamor has thrown the world into chaos.\n\n*The Southern Florescence Scripture*, Scroll Two, Outer Chapters: \"Maintaining and Accommodating\" (Chapter Eleven)\n\nWe hear of maintaining and accommodating the world, but never of governing the world. What does \"maintaining\" mean? It is to fear that the world will corrupt its nature. What does \"accommodating\" mean? It is to fear that the world will alter its virtue. If the world neither corrupts its nature nor alters its virtue, is there any need to govern it?\n\nIn ancient times, when Yao governed the world, he made the people joyful and content in their nature—this was not tranquility. When Jie governed the world, he made the people weary and distressed in their nature—this was not happiness. Neither the absence of tranquility nor the absence of happiness is virtue. And that which is not virtue cannot endure for long.\n\nWhen people are excessively joyful, they harm the yang; when excessively angry, they harm the yin. When yin and yang are both harmed, the four seasons fail to arrive, the harmony of cold and heat is lost, and in turn, this injures the human form. It causes people’s joy and anger to lose their proper place, their dwellings to lack constancy, their thoughts to find no fulfillment, and their endeavors to remain incomplete. From this, the world first becomes restless and unruly, and only then do the conducts of thieves like Zhi and sages like Zeng and Shi arise.\n\nThus, if one were to reward all the good in the world, it would not suffice; if one were to punish all the evil, it would not be enough. Therefore, the vastness of the world is insufficient for rewards and punishments. Since the Three Dynasties and beyond, they have clamored endlessly over rewards and punishments—when would they have had leisure to preserve the true essence of their natures and lives?\n\nMoreover, to delight in cleverness is to be seduced by appearances; to delight in sharpness is to be seduced by sounds; to delight in benevolence is to disorder virtue; to delight in righteousness is to pervert principle; to delight in ritual is to indulge in artifice; to delight in music is to indulge in excess; to delight in sagacity is to indulge in skill; to delight in knowledge is to indulge in fault-finding. If the world seeks to preserve the true essence of its nature and life, these eight may exist or vanish—it matters not. But if the world does not preserve the true essence of its nature and life, these eight become twisted, entangled, and knotted, throwing the world into chaos. And yet, the world begins to revere and cherish them—how profound is its delusion!\n\nIs it merely a matter of recognizing their excess and discarding them? No, they fast and purify themselves to speak of them, kneel and sit to present them, drum and sing to dance for them—what is to be done about this?\n\nThus, when the noble person is compelled to oversee the world, nothing is better than non-action. Only through non-action can the true essence of nature and life be preserved. Therefore, one who values their own person over governing the world may be entrusted with the world; one who cherishes their own person over governing the world may be charged with the world.\n\nIf the noble person can refrain from disturbing their five viscera and from flaunting their intelligence; if they dwell like an ancestral tablet yet manifest like a dragon, remain as still as an abyss yet resound like thunder, move with the spirit and the heavens follow, and act with ease and non-action so that the myriad things rise like steam—then what leisure would they have to govern the world?\n\nCui Qu asked Lao Cong, \"If one does not govern the world, how can the hearts of the people be settled?\"\nLao Cong replied, \"Be careful not to agitate the human heart. The human heart presses downward yet strives upward, trapped between above and below, now yielding, now unyielding, now soft, now hard. It is sharp and carving, its heat scorching like fire, its cold congealing like ice. Its swiftness spans the four seas in the blink of an eye; when at rest, it is deep and still; when in motion, it soars to the heavens. Fierce and proud, it cannot be bound—is there anything like the human heart?\n\nIn ancient times, the Yellow Emperor first used benevolence and righteousness to agitate the human heart. Yao and Shun then wore their thighs bare and their shins hairless in toiling to nourish the forms of the world. They exhausted their five viscera to establish benevolence and righteousness, strained their blood and qi to model laws and standards. Yet even so, they could not prevail. Thus, Yao banished Huan Dou to Mount Chong, exiled the Three Miao to Sanwei, and sent Gong Gong to Youdu—this was their failure to overcome the world.\n\nBy the time this reached the Three Kings, the world was thrown into great alarm. Below, there were tyrants like Jie and Robber Zhi; above, there were sages like Zeng and Shi; and the Confucians and Mohists all arose. From this, joy and anger suspected one another, the foolish and the wise deceived one another, the good and the bad condemned one another, the truthful and the deceitful mocked one another—and the world declined. Virtue diverged, and the nature and lives of the people scattered like wildflowers.\n\nThe world loved knowledge, and the common people were driven to exhaustion. Thus, saws and axes were fashioned, inked cords and knives were wielded, chisels and mallets were employed. The world was thrown into great disorder—all because of the agitation of the human heart.\"",

      "translated_text": "Thus, the worthy withdrew to dwell beneath the great mountains and towering cliffs, while the lords of ten thousand chariots trembled with anxiety in their ancestral halls. In this age, those condemned to death lie heaped upon one another; those in stocks press shoulder to shoulder; and the executed stretch as far as the eye can see. Yet the Confucians and Mohists still raise their arms in contention amidst the fetters and cangues—how extreme is their shamelessness! How utterly devoid of remorse! I know not whether the wisdom of sages does not in truth become the stocks and pillories that break men’s limbs, or whether benevolence and righteousness do not become the fetters and cangues that bore through flesh. How can we know that Zeng and Shi were not the arrow-tips of Jie and Robber Zhi?\n\nTherefore it is said: \"Cut off sageliness, cast aside wisdom, and the world will be greatly ordered.\"\n\nAfter Yellow Emperor had reigned as Son of Heaven for nineteen years, his decrees reached throughout the land. Hearing that Guangchengzi dwelt upon Mount Kongtong, he went to see him and said: \"I have heard that you have attained the perfect Dao. I venture to ask: what is the essence of the perfect Dao? I wish to draw forth the essence of Heaven and Earth to aid the five grains and nourish the people. I also wish to regulate the Yin and Yang to bring all living things to fulfillment. How may this be done?\"\n\nGuangchengzi replied: \"What you wish to inquire about is the substance of things; what you wish to regulate is the ruin of things. Since you have governed the world, the clouds have rained without gathering, the grasses and trees have withered without yellowing, and the light of the sun and moon has grown ever more dim. Your heart, so full of cunning and flattery, is unfit to speak of the perfect Dao.\"\n\nThe Yellow Emperor withdrew, relinquished the world, built a solitary chamber, spread a mat of white cogon grass, and lived in seclusion. Then he returned to seek Guangchengzi again. Guangchengzi lay with his head to the south, and the Yellow Emperor approached from the north, crawling forward on his knees. Bowing twice, he touched his forehead to the ground and asked: \"I have heard that you have attained the perfect Dao. I venture to ask: how may one cultivate the body to attain long life?\"\n\nGuangchengzi rose with a start and said: \"An excellent question! Come, and I will tell you of the perfect Dao. The essence of the perfect Dao is profound and obscure; its utmost reaches are dark and silent. See nothing, hear nothing, hold fast to the spirit in stillness, and the body will right itself. Be still, be pure; do not weary your body, do not agitate your essence, and you may attain long life. Let your eyes see nothing, your ears hear nothing, your heart know nothing, and your spirit will guard your body, and your body will attain long life. Guard your inner self, restrain your outer self, and excess knowledge will bring ruin. I have guided you to the source of great brightness, to the origin of utmost Yang. I have led you through the gate of profound obscurity, to the origin of utmost Yin. Heaven and Earth have their offices, Yin and Yang have their storehouses. Guard your body well, and things will flourish of themselves. I preserve the One and abide in harmony; thus I have cultivated my body for one thousand two hundred years, and my form has never decayed.\"\n\nThe Yellow Emperor bowed twice, touching his forehead to the ground, and said: \"Guangchengzi is like Heaven itself!\"\n\nGuangchengzi said: \"Come, and I will tell you more. Those things are inexhaustible, yet men all take them to be finite; those things are unfathomable, yet men all take them to be limited. Those who attain my Dao may become emperors above and kings below; those who lose my Dao may see light above yet become earth below. Now all the myriad creatures are born from the earth and return to the earth. Therefore I will leave you and enter the gate of the inexhaustible, to wander in the boundless wilds. I share the light of the sun and moon, I endure with Heaven and Earth. Let those who come near me be enlightened; let those who depart from me be benighted. Let all men perish, yet I alone endure.\"\n\nCloud General was roaming eastward when he passed the branches of the whirlwind tree and happened upon Hong Meng. Hong Meng was just then slapping his thighs and leaping about in play. When Cloud General saw him, he stopped in astonishment and stood in awe, saying: \"Old sir, who are you? What are you doing here?\"\n\nHong Meng continued slapping his thighs and leaping without pause. He replied to Cloud General: \"Roaming.\"\n\nCloud General said: \"I wish to ask you something.\"\n\nHong Meng looked up at Cloud General and said: \"Ah!\"\n\nCloud General said: \"The qi of Heaven is not harmonious, the qi of Earth is pent up, the six qi are not balanced, the four seasons are out of order. Now I wish to blend the essence of the six qi to nurture all living things. How may this be done?\"\n\nHong Meng continued slapping his thighs and leaping, shaking his head and saying: \"I do not know! I do not know!\" Cloud General could not press his question.",

      "translated_text": "Three years later, roaming again, Cloud General passed through the wilds of Song and once more encountered Hong Meng. Overjoyed, Cloud General hastened forward and said: \"Has Heaven forgotten me? Has Heaven forgotten me?\" He bowed twice, touching his head to the ground, and entreated Hong Meng for instruction.\n\nHong Meng replied: \"Roaming freely, knowing not what I seek; wandering wildly, knowing not where I go. The roamer is carefree, observing the uncontrived. What do I know?\"\n\nCloud General said: \"I too believed myself to be wandering wildly, yet the people follow wherever I go. I cannot be free of the people—now they have become my shackles. I wish to hear but a single word.\"\n\nHong Meng said: \"To disrupt the warp of Heaven, to violate the nature of things, even the mysterious workings of Heaven cannot bring them to completion. To scatter the herds of beasts, so that birds all cry at night; to bring calamity upon grasses and trees, disaster upon insects—alas, these are the faults of those who govern men.\"\n\nCloud General said: \"Then what am I to do?\"\n\nHong Meng said: \"Alas, how poisonous! Return in bewildered exhaustion.\"\n\nCloud General said: \"I have met with Heaven’s difficulty. I wish to hear but a single word.\"\n\nHong Meng said: \"Alas, nurture the heart. Abide in non-action, and things will transform of themselves. Cast off your form, expel your cleverness, forget both self and things, and merge with the great sameness of the marshlands. Release the heart, liberate the spirit, and become as though soulless. The ten thousand things, teeming and indistinct, each return to their root, each return to their root without knowing it. Vast and undifferentiated, they remain thus all their lives. If one claims to know it, one has already departed from it. Do not inquire into their names, do not scrutinize their natures—things arise of themselves.\"\n\nCloud General said: \"Heaven has bestowed virtue upon me, shown me the way of silence. Through personal seeking, I have now attained it.\" He bowed twice, touching his head to the ground, then rose and took his leave.\n\nThe common people all delight in those who are like themselves and despise those who differ. Those who desire likeness and reject difference do so with the intent of standing out from the crowd. Yet how can one who seeks to stand out from the crowd ever truly do so? Relying on the multitude for tranquility, what one hears will not surpass the skills of the many. Yet those who would govern the realm of men grasp at the benefits of the Three Kings while blind to their perils. This is to gamble with the realm of men—how often can one gamble and not lose it? The chance of preserving the realm is less than one in ten thousand, while the risk of losing it is such that a single failure brings ten thousandfold ruin. Alas, how ignorant are those who hold land!\n\nThose who hold land possess a great thing. Possessing a great thing, one must not be constrained by it. Only by not being constrained by things can one master things. He who understands that the master of things is not a thing himself—how could his governance be limited to the realm and its people? Moving in and out of the six directions, roaming the nine provinces, coming and going alone—this is called possessing singularity. One who possesses singularity is called most noble.\n\nThe teaching of the great person is like the shadow following form, the echo responding to sound. When questioned, they answer, exhausting all that is in their heart, becoming the counterpart of all under Heaven. They dwell in the realm of no echo, move in the realm of no direction. They grasp you and lead you through the bustling throng, roaming without end. Entering and exiting without hindrance, they share no beginning with the sun. They praise and discuss the forms of the body, merging with the great sameness, the great sameness without self. Without self, how can there be possession? Those who perceive possession are the gentlemen of old; those who perceive non-possession are friends of Heaven and Earth.\n\nThat which is lowly yet cannot be shunned is things; that which is humble yet cannot be disregarded is the people; that which is hidden yet cannot be left undone is affairs; that which is coarse yet cannot be set forth is law; that which is distant yet cannot be neglected is righteousness; that which is intimate yet cannot be narrow is benevolence; that which is measured yet cannot be unaccumulated is ritual; that which is centered yet cannot be unexalted is virtue; that which is one yet cannot be unchanging is the Dao; that which is spirit yet cannot be left undone is Heaven.\n\nThus, the sage observes Heaven yet does not assist, completes virtue yet is not burdened, emerges from the Dao yet does not scheme, meets benevolence yet does not rely on it, approaches righteousness yet does not accumulate it, responds to ritual yet does not conceal, engages with affairs yet does not decline, aligns with law yet is not disordered, depends on the people yet does not belittle them, follows things yet does not abandon them. Things are not worth acting upon, yet they cannot be left undone. One who does not understand Heaven is not pure in virtue; one who does not comprehend the Dao has no means to proceed. Alas, those who do not understand the Dao!\n\nWhat is the Dao? There is the Dao of Heaven and the Dao of Man. That which is revered through non-action is the Dao of Heaven; that which is burdened through action is the Dao of Man. The ruler follows the Dao of Heaven; the minister follows the Dao of Man. The Dao of Heaven and the Dao of Man are vastly different—this must not go unexamined.\n\n* * *\n\nThough Heaven and Earth are vast, their transformations are uniform; though the ten thousand things are many, their governance is one; though the masses of people are numerous, their lord is the ruler. The ruler originates in virtue and is completed by Heaven. Thus it is said: The ancient rulers of the world under Heaven practiced non-action, embodying only the virtue of Heaven.\n\nViewing words through the Dao, the rulers of the world are rectified; viewing distinctions through the Dao, the duties of ruler and minister are clarified; viewing abilities through the Dao, the offices of the world are well-ordered; viewing broadly through the Dao, the responses of the ten thousand things are complete. Thus, that which penetrates Heaven and Earth is virtue; that which moves through the ten thousand things is the Dao; that which governs people is affairs; that which involves skill is technique.",

      "translated_text": "The arts are encompassed by affairs, affairs by righteousness, righteousness by virtue, virtue by the Dao, and the Dao by Heaven. Thus it is said: The ancients who nurtured the world under Heaven had no desires, and the world was sufficient; they practiced non-action, and the ten thousand things were transformed; they were profound and still, and the hundred clans were settled.\n\nThe *Record* states: \"Penetrate the One, and the ten thousand affairs are complete; attain effortless mastery, and even ghosts and spirits submit.\" The Master said: \"The Dao—it covers and sustains the ten thousand things, vast and boundless! How great it is! The noble person cannot but examine his heart in this regard.\"\n\nNon-action in doing is called Heaven; non-action in speaking is called virtue; loving people and benefiting things is called benevolence; uniting differences in sameness is called greatness; acting without eccentricity is called magnanimity; possessing the ten thousand differences is called wealth. Thus, holding fast to virtue is called discipline; the completion of virtue is called establishment; following the Dao is called perfection; not allowing things to thwart one’s will is called integrity.\n\nWhen the noble person is enlightened regarding these ten, his mind’s capacity for affairs is profound, and his engagement with the ten thousand things is effortless. Such a one hides gold in the mountains and pearls in the depths, neither valuing wealth nor seeking nobility and riches. He does not rejoice in long life nor grieve over early death; he is not honored by success nor ashamed by poverty. He does not claim the world’s benefits as his private share, nor does he regard ruling the world as a position of glory. When one is illustrious, one is luminous—all things are as a single storehouse, and death and life share the same form.\n\nThe Master said: \"The Dao—profound is its abode, limpid is its clarity. Even metal and stone cannot sound without it. Thus, metal and stone have voices, yet without being struck, they do not ring. Who can determine the ten thousand things?\"\n\nThe person of royal virtue moves plainly and feels shame at being entangled in affairs; he establishes the root and origin and knows how to commune with the spirit. Thus, his virtue is vast, and his heart’s emanations are gathered by things. Therefore, form does not arise without the Dao, nor is life illuminated without virtue. Preserving form and exhausting life, establishing virtue and illuminating the Dao—is this not the person of royal virtue?\n\nVast and unbounded, suddenly emerging, dynamically moving—when the ten thousand things follow him, this is called the person of royal virtue. He sees in darkness and hears in silence. Within darkness, he alone perceives the dawn; within silence, he alone hears harmony. Thus, the deeper one delves, the more one can comprehend things; the more spiritually attuned one becomes, the more one can grasp the essence.\n\nTherefore, in his interaction with the ten thousand things, he is utterly non-substantial yet meets their needs; he roams freely yet binds them to their origins. Great and small, long and short, distant and near.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor roamed north of the Red Water and ascended the heights of Mount Kunlun to gaze southward. Upon returning, he lost his dark pearl. He sent Knowledge to seek it, but it was not found; he sent Li Zhu to seek it, but it was not found; he sent Chi Gou to seek it, but it was not found. Only Xiang Wang obtained it. The Yellow Emperor said: \"How strange! Only Xiang Wang could retrieve it.\"\n\nYao’s teacher was Xu You; Xu You’s teacher was Nie Que; Nie Que’s teacher was Wang Ni; Wang Ni’s teacher was Pi Yi.\n\nYao asked Xu You: \"Could Nie Que be matched with Heaven? I would rely on Wang Ni to assess him.\" Xu You said: \"How perilous it would be to burden the world with him! Nie Que’s nature is keenly intelligent, quick-witted, and surpasses others, yet he still takes humanity as his measure of Heaven. He is strict in preventing transgressions but does not understand their source. Could he be matched with Heaven? He would ride upon people and lose Heaven. He would prioritize the self and differentiate forms, exalt knowledge and rush like fire, be driven by threads of affairs, be ensnared by things, look in all directions for responses, adapt to every contingency, and transform with things without constancy. How could he be matched with Heaven? Nevertheless, he has a lineage and ancestors; he could be a father to the masses but not the father of fathers. Governance under him would lead to disorder, inviting calamity from those who face north and treachery from those who face south.\"\n\nYao observed Hua. Hua addressed Yao, saying: \"Ah! A sage! Let me pray for blessings upon the sage: may the sage live long.\" Yao declined. \"May the sage be rich.\" Yao declined. \"May the sage have many sons.\" Yao declined. Hua said: \"Long life, wealth, and many sons—these are what people desire. Why do you alone not desire them?\" Yao said: \"Many sons bring many fears; wealth brings many affairs; long life brings many humiliations. These three are not means to cultivate virtue, so I decline.\"\n\nHua said: \"At first, I took you for a sage, but now you are merely a gentleman. Heaven generates the ten thousand people and must assign them duties. If one has many sons and assigns them duties, what fear is there? If one is rich and distributes it among others, what affairs remain? The sage dwells like a quail and eats like a fledgling, moves like a bird without ostentation. When the world is ordered, he flourishes with all things; when the world is disordered, he cultivates virtue and retreats into seclusion. After a thousand years, weary of the world, he departs and ascends in weariness, riding the white clouds to the realm of the Emperor. The three calamities do not reach him, and his person remains free from misfortune. What humiliation is there?\"\n\nHua departed.

He continued plowing, damp with sweat, without looking back.\n\nIn the Great Beginning, there was Nonbeing; there was no being, no name. From the One arose the One, yet it had no form. When things received what enabled them to live, this was called *virtue*; when the formless had divisions, yet remained thus without inquiry, this was called *ming*; when movement and stillness gave rise to things, and things took form and principle, this was called *shape*; when shape and body preserved spirit, each with its own pattern, this was called *nature*. Cultivating nature returns to virtue; when virtue reaches its fullness, it merges with the beginning. This merging is emptiness; emptiness is vastness. The beak joins in harmony; when the beak harmonizes, it unites with Heaven and Earth. This union is profound and subtle, seeming foolish and dull—this is called *mysterious virtue*, merging with the Great Compliance.\n\nThe Master turned to Lao Cong and said: \"There is one who governs the Dao as if following another—what is permissible, what is not; what is so, what is not. A debater once said, 'Separating hardness and whiteness is like hanging them apart.' If this is so, can one be called a sage?\"\n\nLao Cong replied: \"This is the toil of clerks bound by skills, wearing out body and mind. A dog trained to catch raccoons grows anxious; a monkey brought from the mountains is skilled in climbing. Qiu, I tell you what you cannot hear and speak what you cannot say. Of those with heads and feet but no heart or ears, there are many; of those with form and those without form or shape who all exist, there are none. Their movement and stillness, their death and life, their decline and rise—these are not their true essence. When governance lies with man, forgetting things and forgetting Heaven, this is called forgetting oneself. One who forgets himself is said to enter into Heaven.\"\n\nJiang Wenqiao saw Ji Che and said: \"The Lord of Lu told me, 'I beg to receive your instruction.' I could not decline his command. Having already told him, I do not know if it was fitting. Allow me to present it again. I said to the Lord of Lu, 'You must practice reverence and frugality, promote those who are publicly loyal and eliminate private favoritism—then who among the people would dare not be harmonious?'\"\n\nJi Che laughed heartily and said: \"If this is what you said, sir, then your words on the virtue of emperors and kings are like a mantis raising its arms to block a chariot wheel—certainly unequal to the task. Moreover, if this is so, then one who acts thus places himself in peril.

      "translated_text": "Zigong traveled south to Chu and, on his return to Jin, passed through Hanyin. There he saw an old man working in his garden, digging a tunnel to enter a well, then hoisting a jar to draw water and irrigate his plots. He toiled laboriously, yet his results were meager.\n\nZigong said, \"There is a device here that can irrigate a hundred plots in a day, requiring little effort yet yielding great results. Would you not wish to use it?\"\n\nThe gardener looked up and asked, \"How does it work?\"\n\nZigong replied, \"Carve wood into a machine—heavy at the rear, light at the front—drawing water as if by suction. It gushes forth like boiling water, and its name is the well-sweep.\"\n\nThe gardener flushed with anger, laughed, and said, \"I have heard from my teacher that those who possess mechanical devices must engage in mechanical affairs, and those who engage in mechanical affairs must harbor mechanical minds. When a mechanical mind resides in the breast, purity and whiteness are incomplete. When purity and whiteness are incomplete, the spirit’s life is unsettled. One whose spirit’s life is unsettled is not borne by the Dao. I am not ignorant of such things—I am ashamed to do them.\"\n\nZigong, abashed, lowered his head and made no reply. After a moment, the gardener asked, \"What are you doing here?\"\n\nZigong said, \"I am a disciple of Confucius.\"\n\nThe gardener replied, \"Are you not one of those who broadly study to emulate the sages, striving to surpass the multitude, playing the zither and singing mournful songs to sell your reputation to the world? You are about to forget your spirit and qi, cast aside your bodily form, yet you barely manage yourself—how could you have leisure to govern the world? Be on your way and do not hinder my work.\"\n\nZigong, humbled and discomfited, lost his color and walked away crestfallen. After thirty li, he gradually recovered. His disciples asked, \"Who was that man earlier? Why did you change countenance and lose composure, remaining unsettled for the rest of the day?\"\n\nZigong said, \"At first, I thought there was only one true person in the world, but I did not know there was another like him. I have heard from the Master that in affairs, one seeks what is possible; in achievements, one seeks completion. To expend little effort and gain much is the Way of the sage. Yet this is not so. One who holds to the Dao has complete virtue; one with complete virtue has complete form; one with complete form has complete spirit. One with complete spirit—this is the Way of the sage. Entrusted with life, he moves among the people yet does not know where he is going, so profound and whole is he. One must forget the mind that seeks merit, profit, and cleverness. As for such a person, if it is not his aspiration, he does not go; if it is not his heart, he does not act. Though the world praises him, if it aligns with his principles, he remains unmoved; though the world condemns him, if it contradicts his principles, he remains unshaken. The world’s praise or blame neither adds nor detracts—this is what is called a person of complete virtue. I am but a man tossed by the winds and waves.\"\n\nReturning to Lu, he told Confucius what had happened. Confucius said, \"He is one who temporarily practices the arts of Hundun’s school. He knows one aspect but not the other; he cultivates his inner self but neglects his outer conduct. One who is clear and enters simplicity, who acts without contrivance and returns to the uncarved block, who embodies nature and embraces the spirit, moving among the customs of the world—would you be so utterly astonished? Moreover, the arts of Hundun’s school—how could you or I truly understand them?\"\n\nZhun Mang was traveling east to the Great Abyss when he encountered Yuan Feng on the shores of the Eastern Sea. Yuan Feng asked, \"Where are you going?\"\n\nZhun Mang replied, \"To the Great Abyss.\"\n\nYuan Feng asked, \"What will you do there?\"\n\nZhun Mang said, \"The Great Abyss is such a thing: pour into it, and it is never full; draw from it, and it is never exhausted. I will wander there.\"\n\nYuan Feng said, \"Do you have no concern for the people with horizontal eyes? I wish to hear about sagely governance.\"\n\nZhun Mang said, \"Sagely governance? Offices are bestowed without error, promotions are made without misjudgment, all circumstances are fully seen, and actions are taken accordingly. Words and deeds arise naturally, and the world is transformed. With a wave of the hand or a glance, the people of the four directions all come—this is called sagely governance. I wish to hear about the virtuous person.\"\n\nZhun Mang said, \"The virtuous person dwells without thought, moves without calculation, and does not harbor right or wrong, beauty or ugliness. Within the four seas, all rejoice in shared benefit and find peace in shared provision. He is as forlorn as an infant who has lost its mother, as bewildered as a traveler who has lost his way. Wealth and resources are abundant, yet he does not know their source; food and drink are sufficient, yet he does not know their origin—this is the bearing of the virtuous person. I wish to hear about the spirit person.\"\n\nZhun Mang said, \"The supreme spirit person rides the light, and form perishes with him—this is called illuminating the vast. He fulfills his mandate and exhausts his nature, delighting in heaven and earth, and all things dissolve. The myriad things return to their nature—this is called the undifferentiated darkness.\"\n\nMen Wu Gui and Chi Zhang Manji observed the army of King Wu. Chi Zhang Manji said, \"He does not measure up to the Yu clan—hence he has encountered this trouble.\"\n\nMen Wu Gui said, \"Was the world well-governed before the Yu clan governed it? Or did it fall into chaos and then they brought order?\"\n\nChi Zhang Manji said, \"The world being well-governed is the wish—why calculate whether it was the Yu clan? The Yu clan’s remedies are like treating sores by shaving the head and applying medicine, or curing illness by seeking a physician. A filial son administers medicine to his compassionate father with a pained expression—sages are ashamed of this. In the age of utmost virtue, worthies are not esteemed, abilities are not employed. Rulers are like the tips of branches, and the people are like wild deer. They are upright yet do not know it as righteousness, they love one another yet do not know it as benevolence, they are sincere yet do not know it as loyalty, they are trustworthy yet do not know it as faithfulness. They move and work together without considering it a favor. Thus, their actions leave no traces, and their affairs leave no record. Filial sons do not flatter their parents, loyal ministers do not fawn on their rulers—this is the height of ministerial conduct. If a son agrees with his parents’ words and finds their actions good, the world calls him an unworthy son. If a minister agrees with his ruler’s words and finds his actions good, the world calls him an unworthy minister. Yet how do we know this must be so?\"",

      "translated_text": "When the world calls right what is right and good what is good, it does not deem such people flatterers. Yet does this mean the world holds parents in stricter reverence than rulers? Call a man a flatterer, and he bristles with indignation; call him a sycophant, and his face darkens with anger. Yet all his life he flatters others, all his life he sycophants—gathering crowds with clever parables and polished words, his beginning and end, root and branch, never once held to account. He drapes himself in robes, adorns himself with colors, assumes the manners of a guest, and fawns upon his age, yet never calls himself a flatterer. He joins the company of such men, aligning right and wrong with them, yet never calls himself one of the crowd. This is the height of folly.\n\nTo recognize one’s folly is not the greatest folly; to recognize one’s confusion is not the greatest confusion. The truly confused never awaken in their lifetime; the truly foolish never gain wisdom. If three walk together and one is confused, the destination may still be reached, for confusion is in the minority. If two are confused, the journey is labored and the goal unattained, for confusion prevails. Now, with the whole world confused, though I have a direction I seek, how can it be attained? Is this not lamentable?\n\nGrand music does not enter the ears of the village; but let the strains of *Zhe Yang* or *Huang Hua* sound, and they burst into laughter. Thus, lofty words do not lodge in the hearts of the crowd; profound speech remains unspoken, for common speech prevails. With two hobbling along in confusion, the destination is lost. Now, with the whole world confused, though I have a direction I seek, how can it be attained? Knowing it cannot be attained yet forcing the matter is yet another confusion. Better to let it go and not press further. If one does not press, who shares the worry?\n\nA man afflicted with leprosy gives birth to a child in the dead of night. He hastily lights a torch to examine it, anxious lest it resemble himself. A hundred-year-old tree is felled to carve sacrificial goblets, painted in green and yellow with intricate designs—yet its offcuts lie discarded in the ditch. Compare the goblet to the offcut in the ditch: one is deemed beautiful, the other ugly, yet both have lost their original nature. Zeng and Shi may differ in their conduct of righteousness, yet their loss of nature is the same.\n\nThere are five ways in which nature is lost:\nFirst, the five colors dazzle the eyes, blinding them;\nSecond, the five sounds deafen the ears, dulling them;\nThird, the five odors cloy the nose, stupefying the senses;\nFourth, the five flavors cloy the palate, deadening it;\nFifth, preferences and aversions agitate the heart, scattering the spirit.\nThese five are all harms to life.\n\nYet Yang Zhu and Mo Di, having strayed from the Dao, claim to have attained it—this is not what I call attainment. If being trapped is called attainment, then the turtledove and crow in a cage may also be said to have attained it. Moreover, chasing after preferences and aversions, colors and sounds, to clutter the inner self; donning ceremonial caps and sashes to constrain the outer form; inwardly propped up by a cage of desires, outwardly bound by layers of restraint; standing entangled in these bonds, believing oneself to have attained—this is like a convict with bound arms and shackled fingers, or a tiger and leopard in a sack or cage, yet claiming to have attained.\n\n---\n\nThe Dao of Heaven moves without accumulation, and so the myriad things are completed; the Dao of the Emperor moves without accumulation, and so the world submits; the Dao of the Sage moves without accumulation, and so the realm obeys. Those who understand Heaven and penetrate the Sage, whose six senses and four limbs align with the virtue of emperors and kings—their self-cultivation is so profound that nothing disturbs their tranquility.\n\nThe Sage’s stillness is not because stillness is good, but because nothing in the myriad things can disturb his heart, and so he is still. When water is still, it clearly mirrors the brows and beard, its level surface serving as a standard—even master craftsmen take it as their model. If still water can be so clear, how much more the spirit? The Sage’s heart is still, a mirror to Heaven and Earth, a reflection of the myriad things.\n\nEmptiness, stillness, tranquility, silence, and non-action—these are the level of Heaven and Earth, the perfection of the Dao and virtue. Thus, emperors, kings, and sages rest in them. In rest, there is emptiness; in emptiness, there is fullness; in fullness, there is order. In emptiness, there is stillness; in stillness, there is movement; in movement, there is attainment. In stillness, there is non-action; in non-action, those who handle affairs are held responsible. In non-action, there is ease; in ease, worries and troubles cannot take hold, and one’s years are long.\n\nEmptiness, stillness, tranquility, silence, and non-action are the root of the myriad things. Understanding this and ruling the south, one becomes a Yao as sovereign; understanding this and serving the north, one becomes a Shun as minister. Applying this in high office, it is the virtue of emperors, kings, and the Son of Heaven; applying this in lowly station, it is the Dao of the obscure sage and unadorned king. Retiring with this and wandering freely among rivers and seas, recluses of the mountains and forests submit to it; advancing with this to govern the world, one’s achievements are great, one’s name illustrious, and the world is unified.\n\nIn stillness, one is a sage; in action, one is a king. In non-action, one is revered; in simplicity, no one in the world can rival one’s beauty. Those who clearly understand the virtue of Heaven and Earth—this is called the great root, the great foundation, harmony with Heaven. This is how one harmonizes the world, how one harmonizes with others. Harmonizing with others is called human joy; harmonizing with Heaven is called Heavenly joy.\n\nZhuangzi said: \"O my master! O my master! You order the myriad things yet are not tyrannical, your blessings extend to ten thousand generations yet are not called benevolence, you are older than high antiquity yet are not called long-lived, you cover and bear Heaven and Earth, carve and shape the myriad forms yet are not called skillful—this is called Heavenly joy. Thus, those who know Heavenly joy move with the Heavenly course in life and transform with things in death. In stillness, they share the virtue of yin; in movement, they flow with the waves of yang. Therefore, those who know Heavenly joy harbor no resentment from Heaven, no blame from others, no burden from things, no reproach from spirits.\n\nThus, in movement, they are like Heaven; in stillness, like Earth. With a single mind settled, they rule the world. Their spirits suffer no haunting, their souls no fatigue. With a single mind settled, the myriad things submit.\n\nThe ghost does not afflict them, the soul does not weary—with a single mind settled, the myriad things yield.\"",

      "translated_text": "Speech that with emptiness and stillness extends to Heaven and Earth, penetrating the myriad things—this is called Heavenly joy. Heavenly joy is the heart of the sage, by which they nurture all under Heaven.\n\nThe virtue of emperors and kings takes Heaven and Earth as its model, the Dao and virtue as its master, and non-action as its constant. In non-action, they employ all under Heaven with abundance; in action, they are employed by all under Heaven yet remain insufficient. Thus, the ancients prized non-action.\n\nWhen the superior practices non-action, the inferior also practices non-action—this is the inferior sharing the same virtue as the superior. When the inferior shares the same virtue as the superior, they do not serve as subjects. When the inferior acts, the superior also acts—this is the superior sharing the same path as the inferior. When the superior shares the same path as the inferior, they do not rule as lords. The superior must practice non-action to employ all under Heaven; the inferior must act to be employed by all under Heaven—this is the unchanging Dao.\n\nThus, the ancient kings of all under Heaven, though their knowledge embraced Heaven and Earth, did not rely on their own deliberation; though their eloquence adorned the myriad things, they did not rely on their own persuasion; though their abilities exhausted the world within the seas, they did not rely on their own efforts. Heaven does not produce, yet the myriad things transform; Earth does not grow, yet the myriad things are nurtured; emperors and kings practice non-action, yet all under Heaven achieves success.\n\nThus, nothing is more spirit-like than Heaven, nothing more abundant than Earth, nothing greater than emperors and kings. Therefore, the virtue of emperors and kings matches Heaven and Earth. This is the Dao of riding Heaven and Earth, driving the myriad things, and employing the hands of others.\n\nThe root lies with the superior, the branches with the inferior; the essential lies with the ruler, the details with the ministers. The deployment of the three armies and five weapons is the least of virtues; rewards and punishments, advantages and harms, the application of the five punishments—these are the least of teachings. Rituals, laws, measures, and standards, the comparison and elaboration of names—these are the least of governance. The sounds of bells and drums, the forms of feathered banners—these are the least of music. Mourning garments of varying degrees, the extremes of ritual attire—these are the least of returning to the root.\n\nThese five least things require the movement of spirit and the activation of the heart’s art before they can be followed. The lesser scholars of later times have had these, yet they are not what should come first.\n\nThe ruler leads and the minister follows; the father leads and the son follows; the elder brother leads and the younger brother follows; the elder leads and the younger follows; the man leads and the woman follows; the husband leads and the wife follows. This precedence of honor and sequence is the course of Heaven and Earth, and thus the sage takes it as their model.\n\nHeaven is honored and Earth is lowly—this is the position of spirit and clarity. Spring and summer come first, autumn and winter follow—this is the sequence of the four seasons. The myriad things arise and take form, their flourishing and decline, their transformations and flows—all follow this pattern. If even Heaven and Earth, most spirit-like, have a sequence of honor and precedence, how much more so does the human Dao?\n\nIn ancestral temples, kinship is honored; in court, honor is honored; in villages, seniority is honored; in conduct, worthiness is honored—this is the sequence of the great Dao. To speak of the Dao yet violate its sequence is not the true Dao; to speak of the Dao yet not follow the Dao—how can one grasp the Dao?\n\nThus, the ancients who illuminated the great Dao first illuminated Heaven, then followed with the Dao and virtue. Once the Dao and virtue were illuminated, they followed with benevolence and righteousness. Once benevolence and righteousness were illuminated, they followed with the division of duties. Once the division of duties was illuminated, they followed with names and punishments. Once names and punishments were illuminated, they followed with delegation and responsibility. Once delegation and responsibility were illuminated, they followed with investigation and reflection. Once investigation and reflection were illuminated, they followed with right and wrong. Once right and wrong were illuminated, they followed with rewards and punishments.\n\nOnce rewards and punishments were clear, the foolish and the wise were placed appropriately, the noble and the base assumed their positions, the benevolent and the worthless followed their natures. Abilities were necessarily distinguished, names necessarily followed. With this, they served their superiors, nurtured their inferiors, governed things, and cultivated themselves. Without employing cunning schemes, they necessarily returned to the Heavenly. This is called Great Peace, the ultimate of governance.\n\nThus, the *Book* says: \"There are punishments and names.\" Punishments and names existed among the ancients, yet they were not what should come first. Those who spoke of the great Dao in ancient times could raise the matter of punishments and names after five changes, and speak of rewards and punishments after nine changes.\n\nTo abruptly speak of punishments and names is to not know their root; to abruptly speak of rewards and punishments is to not know their beginning. To speak of the Dao and then discourse on it, to be within the Dao and then expound on it—these are what people govern, how can they govern others? To abruptly speak of punishments and names, rewards and punishments—this is to possess the tools of governance, not the Dao of governance. They can be employed in all under Heaven, but are insufficient to employ all under Heaven. These are called debaters, people of partial understanding.\n\nRituals, laws, measures, and standards, the comparison and elaboration of names—these existed among the ancients. They are how the inferior serve the superior, not how the superior nurture the inferior.\n\nIn ancient times, Shun asked Yao: \"How does the Son of Heaven employ his heart?\" Yao said: \"I do not slight the bereft, do not abandon the destitute, grieve for the dead, delight in the young, and pity women. This is how I employ my heart.\" Shun said: \"Admirable, yet not great.\" Yao said: \"Then what should it be?\" Shun said: \"To embody Heavenly virtue and emerge in tranquility, with the sun and moon shining and the four seasons proceeding, like the constancy of day and night, with clouds moving and rain falling.\"\n\nYao said: \"How entangled and troubled! You harmonize with Heaven; I harmonize with man.\" Now, Heaven and Earth are what the ancients deemed greatest, what the Yellow Emperor, Yao, and Shun all praised together. Thus, the ancient kings of all under Heaven—what did they do? They simply followed Heaven and Earth.\n\nConfucius traveled west to deposit his books in the Zhou court. Zilu advised: \"I have heard that the Zhou’s Keeper of Archives, an elder named Lao Dan, has resigned and returned home. If you wish to deposit your books, you might try visiting him.\" Confucius said: \"Very well.\" He went to see Lao Dan, but Lao Dan did not consent. Thereupon, Confucius expounded the *Twelve Classics* to refute Lao Dan’s arguments, saying: \"Great indeed! I wish to hear your thoughts.\" Lao Dan said: \"Tell me, are benevolence and righteousness part of human nature?\" Confucius said: \"Yes.\"",

Why is this?\"\n\nLaozi replied, \"Those who are cunning, wise, and spiritually sagacious—I believed myself free of such traits.

At the borderlands, there is a man known as a thief.\n\nThe Dao, in its vastness, does not end; in its minuteness, it does not omit. Thus, the ten thousand things are complete. Boundless is its capacity to embrace all; unfathomable is its depth. Forms, virtue, benevolence, and righteousness are but the remnants of spirit—who but the perfected person can stabilize them? The perfected person possesses the world, yet this is no great matter, nor does it burden him. Though the world strives and strains, he does not follow; though he discerns the unreal, he does not shift for gain. He exhausts the true nature of things and guards their root. Thus, he stands beyond Heaven and Earth, leaves the ten thousand things behind, and his spirit is never constrained.\n\nIn accord with the Dao, in harmony with virtue, he retreats from benevolence and righteousness, sets aside rites and music—the perfected person’s heart is thus settled. The world values the Dao as found in books. Yet books are but words, and words have their value. What is valued in words is their meaning, and meaning has its source.

The virtue of Yao and Shun was abandoned, yet they did not act for its sake; their beneficence spread through ten thousand generations, yet none under heaven knew it—how could it be merely a matter of sighing over *ren* and filial piety? Filial piety, fraternal duty, *ren*, *yi* (righteousness), loyalty, trust, integrity, and incorruptibility—these are all self-exertions that enslave one’s virtue; they are not worthy of praise. Thus it is said: The most noble surpasses state rank; the most wealthy surpasses state wealth; the greatest aspiration surpasses fame and reputation. Therefore, the Dao does not change.\"\n\nBei Men Cheng asked the Yellow Emperor: \"When Your Majesty performed the music of *Xianchi* in the wilds of Dongting, at first I heard it and was afraid; then I heard it and was calmed; finally, I heard it and was bewildered. Vast and silent, I could not find myself.\" The Emperor said: \"You were nearly right to feel so.\"",

      "translated_text": "I performed it through human affairs, harmonized it with Heaven, enacted it with ritual and righteousness, and established it in the Great Purity. The supreme music first responds to human affairs, aligns with Heaven’s principles, proceeds through the Five Virtues, and accords with nature—only then does it regulate the four seasons and bring perfect harmony to the myriad things.\n\nThe four seasons arise in succession, the myriad things follow their birth; now flourishing, now declining, patterned like the alternation of Wen and Wu; now clear, now turbid, yin and yang in balanced harmony, their sounds flowing like radiant light. When hibernating creatures first stir, I startle them with thunder. Its end has no tail, its beginning no head; now dying, now living, now sinking, now rising—ever constant yet never to be awaited. Thus you were afraid.\n\nThen I performed it with the harmony of yin and yang, illuminating it with the brightness of sun and moon. Its sounds could be short or long, soft or hard; transforming uniformly, not bound to fixed forms. In valleys it fills the valleys, in pits it fills the pits; it seals off the spirit, taking things as its measure. Its sounds resound freely, its name lofty and luminous. Thus ghosts and spirits guard their hidden realms, while sun, moon, and stars follow their courses. I halt it at the finite, yet let it flow into the infinite. You wish to ponder it but cannot grasp it, gaze at it but cannot see it, pursue it but cannot reach it. Suddenly you stand on the path of the fourfold void, leaning against a withered catalpa and chanting. Your eyes strain to see what you desire, your strength fails to pursue what you seek—I have already left you behind. When form fills emptiness, it becomes pliable and yielding. You became yielding, and so were calmed.\n\nThen I performed it with the sound of no-sound, attuning it to the mandate of nature. Thus it seemed to blend and surge like tangled growth, a forest of music yet without form; spreading and waving without trailing, dark and obscure yet soundless. Moving without direction, dwelling in profound obscurity—some call it death, some call it life; some call it substance, some call it glory. Flowing and scattering, shifting without fixed sound. The world doubts it, seeking answers from the sages. The sage is one who penetrates to reality and fulfills destiny. The celestial mechanism is not displayed, yet the five senses are all complete—this is called Heaven’s music, which delights the heart without words. Thus the clans of old praised it, saying: \"Exhausted in listening, one hears no sound; gazing, one sees no form. It fills heaven and earth, enveloping the six directions.\" You wish to hear it but find no point of contact—thus you are bewildered.\n\nMusic begins with fear, and fear gives rise to reverence; then I followed it with calm, and complacency leads to escape; finally, it ends in confusion, and confusion gives rise to foolishness. Foolishness leads to the Dao, and the Dao can be borne and journeyed with as one.\n\nConfucius traveled west to Wei. Yan Yuan asked Shi Jin, \"What do you make of our Master’s conduct?\" Shi Jin said, \"Alas! Your Master is truly in dire straits.\" Yan Yuan said, \"Why do you say that?\" Shi Jin replied: \"Before a straw dog is set out for sacrifice, it is placed in a fine basket, wrapped in embroidered cloth, and the invocator fasts and purifies himself to present it. But once it has been set out, passersby trample its head and spine, and fuel-gatherers take it to burn. If one were to gather it up again, place it in a fine basket, wrap it in embroidered cloth, and wander or rest beneath it, one would not dream well and would surely suffer nightmares. Now your Master has taken the already-discarded straw dogs of former teachers, and you disciples wander and rest beneath them. Thus he was hewn down in Song, had his traces erased in Wei, was impoverished in Shang and Zhou—was this not like a nightmare? Besieged between Chen and Cai, seven days without cooked food, life and death as close as neighbors—was this not like a nightmare?\n\nFor traveling on water, nothing is better than a boat; for traveling on land, nothing is better than a cart. To take a boat’s suitability for water and try to push it on land is to spend a lifetime moving no more than a few paces. Are not ancient and modern times like water and land? Are not Zhou and Lu like boat and cart? Now to drag Zhou’s practices into Lu is like pushing a boat on land—laborious and fruitless, and one’s person will surely suffer misfortune. He does not understand the transmission without fixed methods, which responds to things without exhaustion.\n\nMoreover, have you alone not seen the well-sweep? Pull it and it bows; release it and it rises. What pulls it is people, not the sweep pulling people—thus it bows and rises without offending anyone. Therefore, the ritual, righteousness, laws, and institutions of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors were not prized for uniformity but for their efficacy in governance. Thus the ritual, righteousness, laws, and institutions of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors are like the hawthorn, pear, orange, and pomelo—their flavors differ yet all are pleasing to the mouth. Therefore, ritual, righteousness, laws, and institutions are things that change with the times.\n\nNow if you take a macaque and dress it in the Duke of Zhou’s robes, it will surely gnaw and tear them, stripping them off entirely before it is satisfied. To observe the differences between past and present is like the difference between a macaque and the Duke of Zhou. Thus when Xi Shi suffered from heartache and knit her brows in her village, the ugly women of her village saw it and thought it beautiful, so they too clutched their chests and knit their brows in their village. The rich people of the village saw them and firmly shut their doors, refusing to come out; the poor people saw them, took their wives and children, and fled. They knew how to imitate beauty but did not know why Xi Shi’s knitting of brows was beautiful. Alas! Your Master is truly in dire straits.\"\n\nConfucius had reached the age of fifty-one without hearing the Dao, so he went south to Pei to see Lao Dan. Lao Dan said, \"Have you come? I have heard that you are a worthy man of the northern regions—have you attained the Dao?\" Confucius said, \"I have not.\" Lao Dan said, \"How have you sought it?\" Confucius said, \"I sought it in measures and calculations, but after five years I had not attained it.\" Lao Dan said, \"How else have you sought it?\" Confucius said, \"I sought it in yin and yang, but after twelve years I had not attained it.\" Lao Dan said, \"Just so. If the Dao could be offered, there is no one who would not offer it to their lord...\"",

      "translated_text": "Those who cling to power cannot share its handle. Grasping it, they tremble; releasing it, they grieve—yet they see nothing clearly, ever driven by what they cannot cease. Such are the people punished by Heaven. Resentment and gratitude, taking and giving, admonition and instruction, life and death—these eight are the instruments of governance, and only those who follow great change without obstruction can wield them. Thus it is said: \"To govern is to rectify.\" If one’s heart does not accept this, the Gate of Heaven remains closed.\n\nConfucius visited Lao Dan and spoke of benevolence and righteousness. Lao Dan said: \"When chaff fills the eyes, the four directions of heaven and earth seem to shift; when mosquitoes and gnats bite the skin, one cannot sleep through the night. Benevolence and righteousness, so intrusive, stir up my heart—no greater disorder exists! You would have the world not lose its simplicity, yet you yourself move with the wind and stand by accumulated virtue. Why then do you act so strenuously, as if carrying a drum in search of a lost child? The swan is not white from daily bathing, nor is the crow black from daily dyeing. The natural black and white of things are not worth debating; the spectacle of fame and reputation is not worth expanding. When the spring dries up, fish gather on dry land, wetting each other with their breath, moistening each other with foam—yet how much better to forget one another in the rivers and lakes!\"\n\nWhen Confucius returned from seeing Lao Dan, he did not speak for three days. His disciples asked: \"Master, when you visited Lao Dan, what advice did you seek to give?\" Confucius said: \"Only now have I seen the dragon! The dragon coalesces into form, scatters into patterns, rides the clouds and qi, and nourishes itself in yin and yang. My mouth gaped open, yet I could not speak—what advice could I give Lao Dan?\"\n\nZigong said: \"Then are there truly people who dwell like corpses yet manifest like dragons, roar like thunder yet remain as silent as the abyss, and act with the power of heaven and earth? Might I observe such a one?\" Thereupon, he went to see Lao Dan on Confucius’s behalf.\n\nLao Dan was sitting in his hall when he responded, softly: \"My years have advanced, and I am passing away. What would you warn me of?\" Zigong said: \"The governance of the Three Kings and Five Emperors differed, yet their legacy of fame was the same. Why then do you alone deem them not sages?\"\n\nLao Dan said: \"Young man, come closer. Why do you say they differed?\" Zigong replied: \"Yao passed the throne to Shun, Shun to Yu, Yu relied on labor while Tang used force, King Wen submitted to Zhou without daring to oppose, and King Wu opposed Zhou without consenting to submit. Thus I say they differed.\"\n\nLao Dan said: \"Young man, come closer. Let me tell you of the governance of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors. The Yellow Emperor governed the world by unifying the people’s hearts, so that when parents died, they did not mourn—and none found fault with this. Yao governed the world by fostering kinship, so that when people killed their kin, none found fault with this. Shun governed the world by inciting competition, so that pregnant women gave birth in ten months, children spoke at five months, and before they could crawl, they began to recognize others—thus people began to die young. Yu governed the world by altering the people’s hearts, so that each had their own intentions, and weapons followed suit. Killing thieves was not considered killing; people acted as their own kind, and the world was left to itself. Thus the world was greatly alarmed, and the Confucians and Mohists arose. Their beginnings had order, yet now—what can one say of women today? I tell you: the governance of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors was called ‘order,’ yet no greater disorder existed. The wisdom of the Three Sovereigns obscured the brightness of the sun and moon above, disrupted the essence of mountains and rivers below, and threw the seasons’ workings into chaos. Their knowledge exceeded the tail of the *qujiang* beast, yet creatures could not secure the natural state of their lives. And they still called themselves sages—is this not shameful? Truly, they knew no shame!\"\n\nZigong stood uneasily, shifting his feet. Confucius said to Lao Dan: \"I have studied the Six Classics—*The Odes*, *The Documents*, *The Rites*, *The Music*, *The Changes*, and *The Spring and Autumn*—and believed myself well-versed in their principles. I have advised seventy-two rulers, expounding the Way of the former kings and clarifying the governance of the Zhou and Shao, yet not a single ruler adopted them. How difficult it is to persuade people, and how hard to illuminate the Dao!\"\n\nLao Dan said: \"Fortunate indeed that you did not encounter a ruler of this age! The Six Classics are the worn tracks of the former kings—how could they be the very governance itself? What you speak of is still but the track. The track is what the shoe leaves behind—how could it be the shoe itself? When white egrets gaze at one another, their pupils do not move, yet they mate; insects, the male singing on the upwind, the female responding from downwind, yet they mate. Each kind has its own male and female, thus they mate. Nature cannot be altered, fate cannot be changed, time cannot be halted, the Dao cannot be blocked. If one attains the Dao, nothing is impossible; if one loses it, nothing is possible.\"\n\nThree months later, Confucius visited Lao Dan again and said: \"I have grasped it! Crows and magpies hatch their young, fish pass foam to one another, the slender-waisted wasp transforms, and the elder brother weeps for his younger sibling. For too long, I have not transformed with others. If I do not transform with others, how can I transform them?\"\n\nLao Dan said: \"Good. You have grasped it.\"\n\n**Chapter Fifteen: Carving Intentions**\nTo carve intentions and uphold conduct, to depart from the world and differ from the common, to engage in lofty discourse and bitter reproach—this is but arrogance. Such are the scholars of mountains and valleys, not the people of this world, favored by those who wither and plunge into the abyss. To speak of benevolence, righteousness, loyalty, and trust, of reverence, frugality, and deference—this is but cultivation. Such are the scholars of a peaceful age, the teachers and instructors, favored by those who wander and dwell in learning. To speak of great achievements, to establish great fame, to order ruler and minister, to rectify high and low—this is but governance.",

      "translated_text": "Such are the scholars of the court, the men who honor their lords and strengthen their states, favored by those who achieve merit and annex territory.\n\nTo dwell in marshes and wilds, to abide in seclusion and openness, to fish and idle—this is but nonaction. Such are the scholars of rivers and seas, the men who flee the world, favored by those who seek leisure. To practice breath control, to exhale the old and inhale the new, to stretch like a bear and crane—this is but longevity. Such are the practitioners of Dao-yin, the men who nurture the body, favored by those who, like Peng Zu, seek long life.\n\nYet one who does not carve intentions yet rises high, who is not bound by benevolence and righteousness yet cultivates virtue, who seeks no merit or fame yet governs, who does not flee to rivers and seas yet finds leisure, who does not practice Dao-yin yet attains longevity—such a one forgets nothing, yet lacks nothing. Serene and boundless, all beauties follow in their wake. This is the Dao of Heaven and Earth, the virtue of the sage.\n\nThus it is said: tranquility and stillness, emptiness and nonaction—these are the equilibrium of Heaven and Earth, the essence of the Dao and virtue. Thus it is said: when the sage rests in ease, he is level and yielding; being level and yielding, he is tranquil and expansive. Tranquil and expansive, then cares and troubles cannot enter, perverse qi cannot assail. Thus his virtue is whole and his spirit unharmed.\n\nThus it is said: the sage’s life follows the movement of Heaven; his death is the transformation of things. At rest, he shares the virtue of yin; in motion, he moves with the wave of yang. He does not precede fortune, nor initiate misfortune. He responds only when stimulated, moves only when pressed, rises only when compelled. He discards knowledge and precedent, following the principle of Heaven. Thus he suffers no heavenly disasters, no burdens from things, no human reproach, no blame from spirits. His life is like floating; his death, like repose. He neither schemes nor plans ahead. Radiant yet not dazzling, trustworthy yet not bound by expectation. In sleep, he does not dream; awake, he knows no care. His spirit is pure, his soul untiring. Emptiness and tranquility, ease and joy—these accord with Heavenly virtue.\n\nThus it is said: sorrow and joy are the perversions of virtue; delight and anger, the transgressions of the Dao; likes and dislikes, the failures of virtue. Therefore, a heart without sorrow or joy is the perfection of virtue; unchanging unity is the perfection of stillness; nonaction is the perfection of emptiness; noninterference with things is the perfection of indifference; nonresistance is the perfection of purity.\n\nThus it is said: if the body labors without rest, it wears out; if essence is used without cease, it exhausts; exhaustion leads to depletion. Water’s nature is such that if it is unmixed, it is clear; if undisturbed, it is level. If pent up and not flowing, it cannot remain clear—this is the image of Heavenly virtue.\n\nThus it is said: pure and unadulterated, still and unchanging, indifferent and nonactive, moving in accord with Heaven’s course—this is the Way of nurturing the spirit. As for the sword of Gan and Yue, though kept in a casket and never used, it is treasured to the utmost. When the spirit flows unimpeded in all four directions, reaching everywhere without limit, ascending to Heaven above, coiling upon the Earth below, transforming and nourishing the myriad things without leaving a trace—its name is \"unity with the Emperor.\" The Way of purity and simplicity is to guard only the spirit. Guard it without loss, and you become one with the spirit. The essence of this unity penetrates, harmonizing with Heavenly order.\n\nA rustic saying goes: the common man values profit; the incorruptible, fame; the worthy, aspiration; the sage, essence. Thus \"simplicity\" means having nothing mixed with it; \"purity\" means not harming the spirit. One who embodies purity and simplicity is called a \"true person.\"\n\n**Chapter Sixteen: Cultivating Nature**\nTo cultivate nature through custom is to use worldly learning to seek the recovery of one’s original state. To be entangled in desires by custom is to use thought to seek the attainment of clarity—these are called the benighted people.\n\nThe ancients who governed the Dao used tranquility to nurture knowledge. They lived without employing knowledge, which is called using knowledge to nurture tranquility. Knowledge and tranquility nurtured each other, and harmony and principle emerged from their nature. Virtue is harmony; the Dao is principle. Virtue admits all without exclusion—this is benevolence. The Dao orders all without exception—this is righteousness. Righteousness made manifest, things draw near—this is loyalty. Centered, pure, and returning to genuine feeling—this is joy. Trust in conduct, receptivity in bearing, and compliance with pattern—this is ritual. When ritual and music are practiced in a biased manner, the world falls into chaos. If one corrects others while obscuring one’s own virtue, virtue is no longer all-embracing. If it is not all-embracing, things inevitably lose their nature.\n\nIn ancient times, people dwelt in primordial chaos, yet with their age they attained indifference and stillness. In that era, yin and yang were harmonious and calm, ghosts and spirits did not disturb, the four seasons kept their rhythm, the myriad things were unharmed, the multitude of living beings did not die young. Though humans possessed knowledge, they had no use for it—this was called \"perfect unity.\" In that time, none acted, yet all was constantly spontaneous.\n\nWhen virtue declined, Sui Ren and Fu Xi began to govern the world, and thus compliance no longer achieved unity. When virtue declined further, Shen Nong and the Yellow Emperor began to govern the world, and thus peace no longer ensured compliance. When virtue declined still further, Yao and Shun began to govern the world, initiating the currents of governance and transformation. They diluted the rich and scattered the simple, departed from the Dao to pursue goodness, and risked virtue to enact policies. Then they abandoned nature and followed the heart. Hearts recognized one another through knowledge, yet this was insufficient to settle the world. Thus they supplemented it with culture and enriched it with erudition. Culture extinguished substance; erudition drowned the heart. Then the people began to be confused and disordered, unable to return to their nature and recover their original state.\n\nFrom this perspective, the world has lost the Dao, and the Dao has lost the world. World and Dao mutually lose each other—how can the person of the Dao arise in the world, and how can the world arise in the Dao? If the Dao cannot arise in the world, and the world cannot arise in the Dao, then even if the sage does not dwell in the mountains and forests, his virtue is hidden. Hidden, yet not by his own concealment.\n\nThe so-called \"recluses\" of old did not crouch in concealment and refuse to appear, nor did they shut their mouths and refuse to speak, nor hide their knowledge and refuse to express it. The times and fate were greatly awry.",

      "translated_text": "When the times and fate align and one’s Way flourishes throughout the world, one returns to unity without seeking nearness. When the times and fate do not align and one’s Way is utterly thwarted in the world, one deeply roots and calmly abides, awaiting the moment—this is the Way of preserving the self. The ancients who conducted themselves did not adorn their knowledge with eloquence, nor did they exhaust the world with their knowledge, nor did they exhaust virtue with their knowledge. Serene in their place, they returned to their nature—what more was there to do?\n\nThe Dao is not meant for petty conduct; virtue is not meant for petty understanding. Petty understanding harms virtue; petty conduct harms the Dao. Thus it is said: rectify the self and nothing more. To delight in wholeness is called \"attaining one’s aspiration.\" The ancients who spoke of attaining aspiration did not mean attaining rank and emolument; they meant that nothing could augment their joy. Those today who speak of attaining aspiration mean attaining rank and emolument. When rank and emolument rest upon the self, they are not of one’s nature and fate—they are the fortuitous arrival of things, a lodging. As a lodging, their coming cannot be enclosed, nor their going halted. Therefore, one does not indulge one’s aspirations for rank and emolument, nor follow convention in poverty and hardship. One’s joy is the same in both, and so one is without sorrow. If one is unhappy when the lodging departs, then even in joy, one has never been free from distraction. Thus it is said: those who lose themselves in things and forfeit their nature to custom are called \"the people of inverted priorities.\"\n\n---\n\n*Chapter Seventeen: \"Autumn Floods\" of the* Nan Hua True Classic\n\nWhen the autumn floods arrive, the hundred streams pour into the Yellow River. The current swells so vast that between its banks and islets, one cannot distinguish ox from horse. Thereupon, the River Lord rejoiced, believing all the world’s beauty to be contained within himself. Following the current eastward, he came to the Northern Sea. Gazing east, he saw no end to the waters. Thereupon, the River Lord turned his face in dismay, looked toward Ruo, and sighed: \"There is a common saying: 'Hearing the Dao a hundred times, one thinks none can compare to oneself.' That describes me. Moreover, I once heard of those who belittled Confucius’s learning and disparaged Boyi’s righteousness, and I did not believe it. Now that I have witnessed the boundlessness of your waters, had I not come to your gate, I would have been in peril—I would long have been ridiculed by those of great understanding.\"\n\nThe Lord of the Northern Sea said: \"A well frog cannot speak of the sea, confined as it is by its pit; a summer insect cannot speak of ice, bound as it is by its season; a narrow scholar cannot speak of the Dao, constrained as he is by his teachings. Now that you have emerged from your banks and observed the great sea, you know your own inadequacy—you may now be spoken with about great principles. Of all the waters under heaven, none is greater than the sea. The ten thousand streams return to it, yet it never fills, though no one knows when it will cease; its tail drains, yet it never empties, though no one knows when it will end. Unchanged by spring or autumn, unmoved by flood or drought, it surpasses the flow of the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers beyond all measure. Yet I have never taken pride in this, for I compare my form to heaven and earth and receive qi from yin and yang. Within heaven and earth, I am but a pebble or a twig in a great mountain. Aware of my own smallness, why should I take pride? Measuring the four seas within heaven and earth, are they not like a molehill in a vast marsh? Measuring the Central States within the seas, are they not like a grain of millet in a granary? The number of things is called ten thousand, yet humans are but one among them. Of all the people gathered in the nine provinces, where grain is grown and boats and carts travel, humans are but one among them. Compared to the ten thousand things, are they not like the tip of a hair on a horse’s body? What the Five Emperors inherited, what the Three Kings contended for, what the humane worry over, what the devoted labor for—all of it is this. Boyi renounced it to gain fame; Confucius discoursed on it to display his erudition—this was their self-aggrandizement. Is it not like your former self-aggrandizement over your waters?\"\n\nThe River Lord said: \"Then may I consider heaven and earth great and the tip of a hair small?\"\n\nThe Lord of the Northern Sea said: \"No. Things have measure without end; time has no cessation; allotment has no constancy; beginning and end have no fixed pattern. Thus, the greatly wise observe both far and near, so that the small is not deemed little, nor the great deemed much. Knowing measure is without end, they verify the old and the new, so that though pressed they are not distressed, though assailed they are not divided. Knowing time has no cessation, they examine fullness and emptiness, so that though they gain they are not joyful, though they lose they are not sorrowful—knowing allotment has no constancy. Understanding the level path, though born they are not delighted, though dead they do not see it as misfortune—knowing beginning and end have no fixed pattern. Calculating what humans know, it is less than what they do not know; the time of their lives is less than the time before they were born. Seeking to exhaust the realm of the utmost great with what is utmost small, they become confused and cannot attain understanding. From this perspective, how can one know the tip of a hair is sufficient to determine the boundary of the utmost small? How can one know heaven and earth are sufficient to exhaust the realm of the utmost great?\"\n\nThe River Lord said: \"Those who discourse in the world all say: 'The utmost refined has no form; the utmost great cannot be encompassed.' Is this truly so?\"\n\nThe Lord of the Northern Sea said: \"From the small, one cannot see the great in its entirety; from the great, one cannot see the small clearly.

      "translated_text": "Thus, their advantages differ—this is the nature of circumstances. The refined and the coarse are terms applied to what has form; what is formless cannot be divided by calculation; what cannot be encompassed cannot be exhausted by reckoning. What can be discussed in words is the coarse aspect of things; what can be grasped by intention is the refined aspect of things. That which words cannot discuss, and intention cannot fathom, does not fall within the scope of refined or coarse.\n\nTherefore, the conduct of the great person does not extend to harming others, nor does it abound in benevolence and kindness. In action, they do not seek profit, nor do they despise gatekeepers and servants. They do not contend over goods and wealth, nor do they excessively defer; in affairs, they do not rely on others, nor do they overindulge in their own strength, nor do they despise the greedy and corrupt. Their conduct differs from the common, yet they do not excessively avoid eccentricity. They follow the multitude in their actions, yet do not despise flatterers. The world’s ranks and emoluments are insufficient to encourage them; disgrace and punishment are insufficient to shame them. They know that right and wrong cannot be definitively divided, nor can the fine and the vast be clearly demarcated.\n\nIt is said: The Daoist does not strive, the one of utmost virtue does not attain, the great person has no fixed self—this is the utmost in moderation.\n\nThe River Lord said: \"Beyond things, within things—how does one determine nobility and baseness? How does one determine smallness and greatness?\"\n\nThe Lord of the Northern Sea said: \"From the perspective of the Dao, things have no nobility or baseness. From the perspective of things, each values itself and devalues others. From the perspective of custom, nobility and baseness do not reside in oneself. From the perspective of differentiation: if you magnify what is great in something, then nothing is not great; if you diminish what is small in something, then nothing is not small. Knowing that heaven and earth are like a grain of millet, and that the tip of a hair is like a mountain, then the distinctions of measurement become apparent.\n\nFrom the perspective of function: if you affirm what something possesses, then nothing does not possess; if you negate what something lacks, then nothing does not lack. Knowing that east and west are opposites yet cannot be without each other, then the division of function is settled.\n\nFrom the perspective of inclination: if you affirm what something affirms, then nothing is not affirmed; if you negate what something negates, then nothing is not negated. Knowing that Yao and Jie each affirmed their own way and negated the other, then the inclinations of conduct become clear.\n\nIn ancient times, Yao and Shun yielded the throne, yet Zhi and Qiang yielded and perished; Tang and Wu contended and became kings, while the Duke of Bai contended and was destroyed. From this, we see that the rites of contention and yielding, the conduct of Yao and Jie, nobility and baseness have their times—they cannot be taken as constant.\n\nA battering ram can breach a city wall but cannot plug a hole—this speaks of differing implements. The swift horses Qi Ji and Luo Li can gallop a thousand *li* in a day, yet they are not as good as a wildcat at catching mice—this speaks of differing skills. The owl can snatch fleas at night and discern the tip of a hair, yet when it stares with wide eyes, it cannot see a mountain—this speaks of differing natures.\n\nThus, it is said: How can one take this as right and that as wrong, take order as order and chaos as chaos? This is to fail to understand the principles of heaven and earth and the conditions of the myriad things. It is like taking heaven as teacher without earth, taking yin as teacher without yang—its impossibility is clear. Yet if one still speaks of it without ceasing, they are either foolish or deceitful.\n\nThe succession of emperors and kings differs; the inheritance of the Three Dynasties differs. Those who go against their time and defy custom are called usurpers; those who align with their time and follow custom are called righteous followers.\n\nSilent, O River Lord, how do you know the gate of nobility and baseness, the domain of smallness and greatness?\"\n\nThe River Lord said: \"Then what should I do? What should I not do?

This is called reversal and overflow—do not constrain your aspirations, for they will greatly diverge from the Dao. What is few? What is many? This is called alternation and exchange—do not act with singularity, for you will be at odds with the Dao.\n\nSolemn as a state with its ruler, yet without private virtue; reverent as a sacrifice with its altar, yet without private blessing; boundless as the four directions without limit, without any restricted domain. Embracing the myriad things, who bears them up? This is called having no fixed direction.\n\nThe myriad things are equal—who is short? Who is long? The Dao has no end or beginning; things have death and life, yet do not rely on their completion. Now empty, now full, they do not abide in their form. Years cannot be lifted, time cannot be halted; ebb and flow, fullness and emptiness—when they end, they begin again. This is how one speaks of the great meaning’s direction, discusses the principles of the myriad things.\n\nThe arising of things is like a gallop, like a swift ride—there is no movement that does not change, no moment that does not shift. What is there to do? What is there not to do? Things will transform of themselves.\"\n\nThe River Lord said: \"Then what is the value of the Dao?\"\n\nThe Lord of the Northern Sea said: \"One who knows the Dao necessarily comprehends principle; one who comprehends principle necessarily understands adaptability; one who understands adaptability does not allow things to harm them. The one of utmost virtue: fire cannot burn them, water cannot drown them, cold and heat cannot harm them, birds and beasts cannot injure them. This does not mean they are careless—it means they discern safety and danger, are serene amid fortune and misfortune, are cautious in approach and retreat, so that nothing can harm them.\n\nThus it is said: Heaven is within, humans are without; virtue resides in heaven. Knowing the conduct of heaven and humans, rooted in heaven, positioned in attainment—contracting and expanding, returning to the essential and speaking of the ultimate.\n\nWhat is called heaven?

He fled in haste.\n\nZhuangzi was fishing at Pu River when the King of Chu sent two ministers to approach him first, saying, “Our king wishes to burden you with the affairs of the realm.” Zhuangzi held his rod and did not turn, saying, “I have heard that in Chu there is a divine tortoise, dead for three thousand years, which the king keeps wrapped in silk and stored in a shrine. Would this tortoise rather have died to leave its bones venerated, or lived to drag its tail through the mud?” The two ministers replied, “It would rather live and drag its tail through the mud.” Zhuangzi said, “Go then. I too will drag my tail through the mud.”\n\nWhen Huizi was prime minister of Liang, Zhuangzi went to visit him. Someone told Huizi, “Zhuangzi is coming to replace you as minister.” Thereupon Huizi grew alarmed and searched the state for three days and three nights. Zhuangzi went to see him and said, “In the south there is a bird called the *yuanyang*. Do you know it? The *yuanyang* sets out from the South Sea and flies to the North Sea; it perches only on the *wutong* tree, eats only bamboo fruit, and drinks only from sweet springs.

The Marquis of Lu received it with ceremony and offered it wine in the ancestral temple, performed the *Nine Shao* as music, and prepared the grandest sacrificial feast. Yet the bird only gazed in distress, grieving—it dared not eat a single morsel, dared not drink a single cup, and died after three days.\n\nThis was nourishing the bird with what nourishes oneself, not with what nourishes the bird. To nourish a bird as a bird should be nourished, one ought to let it perch in deep forests, roam over open plains, float upon rivers and lakes, feed on minnows and loaches, follow its flock in flight, and rest where it wills. It cares nothing for human speech—why then all this pomp and fuss?\n\nWhen the music of *Xianchi* and *Nine Shao* is played across the wilds of Dongting, birds hear it and take flight, beasts hear it and flee, fish hear it and dive deep, while men, should they hear it, turn back to gather and listen. Fish live in water, yet men die in it—surely they differ, for their likes and dislikes are not the same.\n\nThus the sages of old did not impose a single standard of ability nor demand uniformity in affairs. Names were confined to reality, and principles were set to fit the circumstance—this is what is called \"orderly attainment and enduring fortune.\"\n\nLiezi was traveling and took a meal by the roadside when he saw a century-old skull.

      "translated_text": "Seeds possess their latent potential. When they obtain water, they grow robust; when they find the border between water and earth, they become the raiment of dragons. Born upon a mound, they become the mound-crow; if the mound-crow gains dense shade, it becomes crow’s-foot. The root of crow’s-foot becomes the navel-cicada, its leaves become butterflies. Butterflies swiftly transform into insects, born beneath the tortoise’s shell, their form like a cast-off skin, their name *jiurang*. After a thousand days, *jiurang* becomes a bird, called *ganyugu*. The foam of *ganyugu* becomes *simí*, and *simí* becomes *shiyùn*. From *shiyùn* is born *yixia*! From *huangyu* is born *jiuyou*, from *piyin* is born the rotten silkworm cocoon. The sheep’s-tare joins with the uninked bamboo, and from old bamboo is born *qingning*; *qingning* gives birth to *cheng*, *cheng* to the horse, the horse to man—and man, in turn, returns into the mechanism. All things emerge from the mechanism, all things enter into the mechanism.\n\n*The Southern Florescence Sutra*, \"Spring, Part Three\" concludes.\n\n---\n\nThose who grasp the essence of life do not strive for what life cannot achieve; those who grasp the essence of fate do not strive for what knowledge cannot alter. To nourish the body, one must first provide it with things—yet there are cases where things are abundant yet the body remains unnourished. To sustain life, one must first avoid separation from the body—yet there are cases where the body remains intact yet life perishes. Life’s arrival cannot be refused, its departure cannot be halted. Alas! The people of the world believe that nourishing the body is enough to preserve life, yet if nourishing the body is truly insufficient to preserve life, then what in the world is worth doing? Though it may not suffice, it cannot be left undone—such efforts are inescapable. To escape the demands of the body, nothing surpasses fleeing the world. Abandon the world, and one is free of entanglements; free of entanglements, one attains perfect equilibrium; in perfect equilibrium, one exchanges life with that which is other—and in this exchange, one approaches the subtle. Why cling to affairs? Why discard life? Forsake affairs, and the body is not wearied; relinquish life, and the essence is not depleted. When the body is whole and the essence restored, one becomes one with Heaven. Heaven and Earth are the parents of the myriad things: united, they form a body; dispersed, they become a beginning. When form and essence are not depleted, this is called \"the power to shift\"; when essence is refined into yet greater essence, it returns to assist Heaven.\n\nMaster Liezi asked Guan Yin: \"The perfected person walks underwater without obstruction, treads fire without heat, moves above the myriad things without fear. How does one attain this?\" Guan Yin replied: \"This is the preservation of pure qi, not the rank of cunning, skill, or daring. Sit, and I will tell you. All things possessing form, image, sound, or color are merely objects—how can objects be far from one another? Why should one strive to be first? It is but a matter of appearance. Thus, the creation of things halts at the formless and ceases where there is no transformation. One who attains this and exhausts it—how could things constrain them? They dwell within the measure of no excess, conceal themselves in the thread of no origin, roam through the beginning and end of the myriad things, unify their nature, nurture their qi, harmonize their virtue, and thereby commune with the source of things. Such a one’s Heavenly endowment remains whole, their spirit undivided—how could things intrude? The drunkard who falls from a carriage, though moving swiftly, does not die. His bones and joints are the same as others’, yet the harm he suffers differs—his spirit is whole. He does not know he is riding, does not know he has fallen; death and life, terror and dread do not enter his breast. Thus, he meets things without breaking. If one who is whole through wine can be thus, how much more so one who is whole through Heaven? The sage conceals himself in Heaven, and so nothing can harm him. A flexible vine does not snap in the wind; even one with a vengeful heart does not resent a tile blown by the gale—thus the world is in perfect balance. Therefore, there are no wars of aggression, no punishments of slaughter—this is the Way of such things. Do not open the Heavenly in man, but open the Heavenly of Heaven. Opening the Heavenly gives birth to virtue; opening the human gives birth to harm. Do not reject Heaven, do not neglect man—then the people will approach their true nature.\"\n\nConfucius, traveling to Chu, emerged into a forest and saw a hunchbacked old man catching cicadas with a pole, as if picking them up by hand. Confucius said: \"You are skillful! Is there a method to this?\" The man replied: \"I have a method.\"",

I pressed him, but he would not explain. May I ask what he meant?\"\n\nConfucius replied: \"Those skilled in swimming can master it quickly because they have forgotten the water. As for divers, who can handle a boat the first time they see one—it is because they see the abyss as if it were dry land, and a capsized boat as if it were merely a cart rolling backward.

I wish to hear it.\"\n\nKaizhi said: \"I heard the master say that one who nurtures life well is like a shepherd: he watches those who lag behind and urges them forward with his whip.\"\n\nThe duke asked: \"What does that mean?\"\n\nTian Kaizhi replied: \"In Lu there was a man named Shan Bao, who lived in the mountains, drank from streams, and did not compete with others for profit. Though he lived to seventy, his complexion remained like that of a child. Yet he was unlucky enough to meet a hungry tiger, which killed and ate him. There was also Zhang Yi, who frequented the gates of the wealthy and spared no effort in his pursuits. Though he lived only to forty, he died of internal heat. Bao nurtured his inner self, but the tiger devoured his outer; Yi nurtured his outer self, but illness attacked his inner. These two men both failed to urge on those who lagged behind.\"\n\nConfucius said: \"Do not hide so deeply that you are unseen, nor expose yourself so openly that you are exposed—stand like a withered tree in the center. If you attain these three, your name will surely reach its peak. Those who fear the road may kill one in ten travelers, so fathers and sons, brothers and kin warn one another, and none dare venture out without a large escort—is this not wisdom? Yet what people truly fear are the mats they sit on and the food they eat. Not knowing to guard against these is the real mistake.\"\n\nA sacrificial official, dressed in dark robes, approached the pen of pigs and said to one: \"Why do you hate death? I will fatten you for three months, purify you for ten days, fast for three, spread white rushes beneath you, and place your shoulder and haunch upon the carved sacrificial platter—will you agree to this?\" Speaking for the pig, he said: \"Better to live on husks and糟 in the pen than to face such a fate.\" But speaking for himself, he said: \"Yet if I could live with the honor of a high minister and die with my body laid upon fine mats and coffins, I would choose that.\" What differs between the pig’s choice and his own?\n\nDuke Huan was hunting in the marshes with Guan Zhong driving his chariot when he saw a ghost. The duke grasped Guan Zhong’s hand and said: \"What did you see, Uncle Zhong?\"\n\nGuan Zhong replied: \"I saw nothing.\"\n\nOn their return, the duke fell ill and did not emerge for days. A Qi scholar named Li Ziao told him: \"It is you who have harmed yourself—the ghost could not harm you. When the qi of anger and grief scatters and does not return, it causes deficiency. When it rises but does not descend, it makes one prone to rage; when it descends but does not rise, it makes one prone to forgetfulness. If it neither rises nor descends but lodges in the center of the body, at the heart, it causes illness.\"\n\nDuke Huan asked: \"Then are there ghosts?\"\n\nHe replied: \"There are. In the marshes dwell the *lü*; in the waters, the *ao* with its topknot.\"",

Do not reject Heaven, do not neglect man—then the people will approach their true nature.\"\n\nConfucius, traveling to Chu, emerged into a forest and saw a hunchbacked old man catching cicadas with a pole, as if picking them up by hand. Confucius said: \"You are skillful! Is there a method to this?\" The man replied: \"I have a method.\"",

      "translated_text": "Within the confines of a household’s inner walls, even the clamor of thunder dwells. In the northeast’s lower reaches, the *bei’e* and *guilong* leap; in the northwest’s lower reaches, the *zhiyang* resides. Waters harbor the *wangxiang*, mounds the *xing*, mountains the *kui*, wilds the *fanghuang*, and marshes the *weiyi*.\n\nThe duke asked: \"What is the form of the *weiyi* like?\"\n\nPrince Huangzi replied: \"The *weiyi* is as large as a wheel hub, as long as a chariot shaft, clad in purple robes with a crimson crown. As a creature, it abhors the sound of thunderous chariots—when it hears them, it clutches its head and stands upright. To see it is nearly a sign of hegemony.\"\n\nDuke Huan burst into joyful laughter: \"This is what *I* saw!\" Thereupon, he straightened his robes and cap, sat with the prince, and before the day was out, he was unaware that his illness had departed.\n\nJi Yuzi raised fighting cocks for the king. After ten days, the king asked: \"Are the cocks ready?\"\n\n\"Not yet,\" he replied. \"They are still hollow and reliant on their qi.\"\n\nAfter another ten days, the king asked again. \"Not yet,\" he said. \"They still react to shadows.\"\n\nAfter another ten days, the king asked once more. \"Not yet,\" he replied. \"They still glare fiercely and bristle with qi.\"\n\nAfter yet another ten days, the king asked again. \"Almost there,\" he said. \"Though other cocks may crow, they show no change. Gazing at them, they seem like wooden cocks—their virtue is complete. No other cock dares respond; they turn and flee.\"\n\nConfucius observed the Lüliang Falls, where the water plunged thirty *ren* and its froth stretched forty *li*, a place where even the *aoyu* and *aoman* could not swim. He saw a man swimming there and, assuming he was in distress and wished to die, sent his disciples along the current to rescue him. After several hundred paces, the man emerged, his hair unbound, singing as he strolled beneath the embankment.\n\nConfucius followed and questioned him: \"I took you for a ghost, but seeing you, you are a man. May I ask—is there a Dao for treading water?\"\n\n\"No,\" he replied. \"I have no Dao. I began with habit, grew with nature, and completed it with fate. I enter with the current and emerge with the flow, following the water’s Way without imposing my will. This is how I tread it.\"\n\nConfucius asked: \"What do you mean by beginning with habit, growing with nature, and completing with fate?\"\n\nHe replied: \"I was born on the hills and at ease on the hills—this is habit. I grew up in the water and am at ease in the water—this is nature. I do not know why I am thus, yet I am thus—this is fate.\"\n\nZiqing of Lu carved wood into a *ju* stand. When it was finished, those who saw it marveled as if it were the work of ghosts or spirits. The Lord of Lu saw it and asked: \"What technique did you use to make this?\"\n\nHe replied: \"I am but a craftsman—what technique could I possess? Nevertheless, there is one thing. When I set out to make the *ju*, I never dared to waste my qi but always fasted to still my mind. After three days of fasting, I no longer dared to think of rewards, ranks, or emoluments. After five days, I no longer dared to think of praise or blame, skill or clumsiness. After seven days, I suddenly forgot I had limbs or a body. At that time, was there any court? My skill became concentrated, and external distractions dissolved. Only then did I enter the mountain forest to observe the natural qualities of the wood. When the perfect form appeared before me, I set to work—otherwise, I would stop. Thus, I matched heaven with heaven. Is this not why the vessel seems divine?\"\n\nYe Ji demonstrated his charioteering before Duke Zhuang. His advances and retreats aligned with the plumb line, his left and right turns followed the compass. The duke thought even Wen could not surpass him and sent him to drive a hundred circuits before returning.\n\nYan Yu encountered him and, upon entering, said: \"Ji’s horses are about to fail.\"\n\nThe duke remained silent and did not respond. Soon after, the chariot indeed failed and returned.\n\nThe duke asked: \"How did you know?\"\n\nHe replied: \"His horses’ strength was exhausted, yet he still demanded more—hence I said they would fail.\"\n\nA craftsman’s hammer and chisel follow the compass and square, his fingers transform with the material without mental calculation. Thus, his spirit-terrace is unified and unobstructed. Forget the feet, and the shoes fit; forget the waist, and the belt fits; forget right and wrong, and the mind is at ease. Without inner change or outer compliance, one meets events with perfect accord. To begin with ease and never be without it is to forget the ease of ease.\n\nThere was a man named Sun Xiu who, arriving at Bian Qingzi’s door, lamented: \"In my village, I am not called unrefined; in times of peril, I am not called cowardly. Yet when I till the fields, I do not meet with good years; when I serve a lord, I do not meet with a favorable era. I am shunned by my village, driven from my district—what sin have I committed against heaven? Why must I suffer this fate?\"\n\nBianzi replied: \"Have you never heard of the Perfect Man’s conduct? He forgets his liver and gall, disregards his ears and eyes, wandering in a daze beyond the dust and grime, carefree in the realm of no affairs. This is called acting without reliance, growing without domination. Now you adorn your knowledge to startle the foolish, cultivate your person to expose others’ flaws, shining brightly as if carrying the sun and moon in your stride.

Asking the reason, Zhuangzi was told, \"It is of no use.\"\n\nZhuangzi said, \"This tree, by being useless, has attained the full span of its natural years.\"\n\nLeaving the mountains, Zhuangzi lodged at the home of an old friend. The friend, pleased, ordered a servant to kill a goose and cook it. The servant asked, \"One can cackle, the other cannot—which should we kill?\"\n\nThe host said, \"Kill the one that cannot cackle.\"\n\nThe next day, a disciple asked Zhuangzi, \"Yesterday, the tree in the mountains, by being useless, attained the full span of its natural years.

Between usefulness and uselessness—it seems so, yet it is not, and thus one is not yet free from entanglement. But if one rides the Dao and floats upon virtue, it is otherwise: neither praised nor blamed, now a dragon, now a snake, transforming with the times without clinging to any one form; rising and falling, taking harmony as the measure, drifting upon the ancestor of the ten thousand things, treating things as things yet not being treated as a thing by them—how then could one be entangled?

Gathered in boundless vastness, one sends off the departing and welcomes the arriving. Let those who come not be forbidden, let those who go not be stopped. Follow their strength and bend, adapt to their crookedness, and let them exhaust themselves. Thus, morning and evening, the levies were collected without so much as a hair being harmed—how much more so for those on the great thoroughfare?\"\n\nConfucius was besieged between Chen and Cai, going seven days without cooked food. Taigong Ren went to condole with him, saying: \"You nearly died, did you not?\"\n\nConfucius said: \"Yes.\"\n\n\"Do you hate death?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nRen said: \"Have you not spoken of the way of not dying? In the Eastern Sea there is a bird called *Yidai*. As a bird, it is scattered and disorderly, seemingly incapable. It flies only when led, perches only when pressed, advances not daring to be first, retreats not daring to be last. It does not dare to eat first but must take the leavings. Thus, it is not expelled from the flock, and others cannot harm it, so it escapes misfortune. Straight trees are felled first, sweet wells are drained first. You, I fear, adorn your knowledge to startle the foolish, cultivate yourself to expose the impure, and shine forth as if carrying the sun and moon in your march—how could you escape?\"\n\nLong ago, I heard from a man of great completion: 'He who boasts of himself achieves no merit; he who achieves merit is envied; he who achieves fame is diminished. Who can relinquish merit and fame and return to the common people? The Dao flows but does not dwell in glory; it acts but does not claim a place. Pure and constant, it is nearly mad. Shave off edges, discard influence, and do not seek merit or fame. Thus, one bears no blame from others, and others bear none from him. The perfected man is unknown—why do you delight in this?'\n\nConfucius said: \"Well said!\" He took leave of his acquaintances, sent away his disciples, and fled to the great marsh. He wore a robe of coarse cloth and ate acorns and chestnuts. Entering among beasts, he did not disturb their herds; entering among birds, he did not disrupt their flocks. Birds and beasts did not hate him—how much less men?\n\nConfucius asked Zisang Hu: \"I was twice banished from Lu, had a tree felled upon me in Song, was made a fugitive in Wei, was destitute between Shang and Zhou, and besieged between Chen and Cai. I have suffered these many misfortunes, my close associates have grown more distant, and my disciples and friends have scattered—why is this?\"\n\nZisang Hu said: \"Have you not heard of the flight of the man of Jia? Lin Hui abandoned a jade disc worth a thousand gold pieces and carried a baby on his back as he fled. Someone asked: 'Was it for the money? The baby’s value in coin is little. Was it for the burden? The baby’s burden is great. Why abandon a jade disc worth a thousand gold pieces and carry a baby on your back?' Lin Hui said: 'That was bound by profit; this is bound by Heaven. Those bound by profit abandon one another in straitened circumstances, disaster, and harm. Those bound by Heaven gather together in straitened circumstances, disaster, and harm. The difference between gathering and abandoning is vast. Moreover, the friendship of the noble is as bland as water; the friendship of the petty is as sweet as wine. The noble are bland yet intimate; the petty are sweet yet estranged. Those who come together without cause will part without cause.'\n\nConfucius said: \"I respectfully receive your instruction.\" He walked slowly and leisurely on his return, abandoned his studies, and discarded his books. His disciples no longer bowed before him, yet their affection grew deeper.\n\nAnother day, Zisang Hu said: \"When Shun was about to die, he sincerely warned Yu: 'Beware! In form, nothing is better than following; in feeling, nothing is better than sincerity. Following, one does not stray; sincere, one does not toil. Not straying, not toiling, one does not seek ornament to adorn form. Not seeking ornament to adorn form, one certainly does not depend on things.'\"\n\nZhuangzi wore a patched robe of coarse cloth, fastened his shoes with hemp, and passed by the King of Wei. The king said: \"Why is the master so weary?\"\n\nZhuangzi said: \"It is poverty, not weariness. A scholar with the Dao and virtue who cannot practice them is weary. Wearing tattered clothes and threadbare shoes is poverty, not weariness. This is what is called not encountering the times. Have you alone not seen the leaping monkeys?\"",

      "translated_text": "When the gibbon obtains towering catalpa or camphor trees, it grasps the vines and swings through their branches, reigning supreme in its domain—even Yi or Feng Meng could not challenge its mastery. Yet when it finds itself among brambles, thorns, and tangled roots, it moves with caution, glancing sideways, trembling and quaking. Not that its sinews and bones have suddenly stiffened or lost their suppleness, but the terrain is unfavorable, insufficient for it to display its full ability.\n\nNow, to dwell amid benighted rulers and chaotic ministers and yet hope to avoid weariness—how could this be possible? This is like the fate of Bi Gan, whose heart was carved out as proof.\n\nConfucius was stranded between Chen and Cai, going seven days without cooked food. Leaning left against a withered tree, striking its dry branches with his right hand, he sang the airs of the House of Shen. The instruments were present, but the measures were not; the sounds were there, but the modes of gong and jue were absent. Yet the resonance of wood and voice plowed deep, striking true in the hearts of men. Yan Hui stood with hands folded, turning his gaze to observe.\n\nFearing that Hui might expand his own concerns into grand ambitions or turn self-love into sorrow, Confucius said: \"Hui, to bear the decrements of Heaven is easy; to bear the benefits of men is hard. There is no beginning that is not an end—man and Heaven are one. Who, then, is the singer of this song today?\"\n\nYan Hui replied: \"May I ask why bearing the decrements of Heaven is easy?\"\n\nConfucius said: \"Hunger and thirst, cold and heat, the blockage of one’s path—these are the workings of Heaven and Earth, the outpourings of the movement of things. To speak of going along with them is to say one moves in tandem with them. As a minister, one does not dare to abandon this way. If even the way of serving as a minister is thus, how much more so the way of awaiting Heaven’s decree?\"\n\n\"What, then, is meant by bearing the benefits of men being hard?\"\n\nConfucius said: \"At the outset, one’s path opens in four directions, ranks and emoluments arrive without end, and all that benefits things is not one’s own—my fate lies beyond me. The noble man does not steal; the worthy man does not pilfer. If I were to take such things, what would I be? Thus it is said: No bird is wiser than the magpie. Where its eyes ought not to linger, it does not even glance. Though the fruit falls before it, it abandons it and flees. It fears men and yet nests among them—merely to preserve its nest and young. What is meant by ‘no beginning that is not an end’?\"\n\nConfucius said: \"When the myriad things transform and one does not know who succeeds them, how can one know their end?

      "translated_text": "What is meant by \"man and Heaven as one\"?\n\nConfucius said: \"There is man—this is Heaven; there is Heaven—this too is Heaven. That man cannot be Heaven is his nature. The sage rests in this and drifts to his end.\"\n\nZhuang Zhou was wandering within the enclosure of Carved Mound when he saw an unusual magpie coming from the south. Its wings spanned seven feet, its eyes measured an inch across. It brushed against Zhou’s forehead and alighted in the chestnut grove. Zhuang Zhou said: \"What bird is this? Its wings are vast yet it does not fly, its eyes are large yet it does not see.\" He hitched up his robe, strode forward, took up his sling, and waited. He saw a cicada, having just found a fine shade, forget its own body; a mantis, seizing the opportunity, raised its forelegs to strike it, seeing only its gain and forgetting its form; the strange magpie, drawn by this, saw only the advantage and forgot its true nature. Zhuang Zhou shuddered and said: \"Ah! Things indeed entangle one another—two kinds summon each other.\" He cast aside his sling and turned to flee, but the warden of the grove pursued and berated him. Zhuang Zhou returned home and for three months did not appear in the courtyard.\n\nLan Ju followed and asked him: \"Master, what has been the matter? For some time now, you have not come to the courtyard.\"\n\nZhuang Zhou said: \"I guarded my form and forgot my body. I gazed upon muddy water and was lost in the clear abyss. Moreover, I have heard from my master: 'Enter their customs, follow their customs.' Today, I wandered in Carved Mound and forgot my body; the strange magpie struck my forehead. I roamed in the chestnut grove and forgot my true nature; the warden of the grove took me for a thief. That is why I have not come to the courtyard.\"\n\nYangzi traveled to Song and lodged at an inn. The innkeeper had two concubines—one beautiful, the other ugly. The ugly one was honored, the beautiful one despised. Yangzi asked the reason, and the innkeeper’s servant replied: \"The beautiful one is beautiful in her own eyes, but I do not see her beauty. The ugly one is ugly in her own eyes, but I do not see her ugliness.\"\n\nYangzi said: \"Disciples, take note: act worthily and abandon the conduct of self-regard. Wherever you go, will you not be loved?\"\n\n---\n\n*Southern Florescence Perfected Scripture*, Scroll Four, Outer Chapters: \"Tian Zifang,\" Twenty-First\n\nTian Zifang was in attendance, sitting beside the Lord of Wei. He repeatedly praised Xi Gong. The Lord said: \"Is Xi Gong your teacher?\"\n\nZifang said: \"No. He is a man of my village. He speaks of the Dao often and aptly, so I praise him.\"\n\nThe Lord said: \"Then do you have no teacher?\"\n\nZifang said: \"I do.\"\n\nThe Lord said: \"Who is your teacher?\"\n\nZifang said: \"Shu Guo Shunzi.\"\n\nThe Lord said: \"Then why have you never spoken of him?\"\n\nZifang said: \"His person is true: his human form holds Heaven’s emptiness, he is pure and preserves the real, clear yet accommodating of things. When things lack the Dao, he rectifies his bearing to awaken them, dissolving their intentions. How could I be worthy to praise him?\"\n\nZifang departed. The Lord sat in a daze for the rest of the day without speaking. He summoned his ministers who stood before him and said: \"How distant is the gentleman of perfect virtue! At first, I took the words of sagely wisdom and the conduct of benevolence and righteousness to be the ultimate. But now that I have heard of Zifang’s teacher, my form is unstrung and I do not wish to move, my mouth is sealed and I do not wish to speak. What I have learned is but a clay figurine—Wei has truly been a burden to me.\"\n\n---\n\nWen Bo Xuezi traveled to Qi and stayed in Lu. A man of Lu requested to see him. Wen Bo Xuezi said: \"No. I have heard that the gentlemen of the Central States are enlightened in ritual and righteousness but coarse in understanding the human heart. I do not wish to see them.\"\n\nWhen he returned to Qi and stayed again in Lu, the same man requested to see him. Wen Bo Xuezi said: \"Before, he sought to see me; now, he seeks to see me again. He must have something to stir me.\" He went out to meet the guest, then returned and sighed. The next day, he met the guest again and returned, sighing once more.\n\nHis servant said: \"Each time you meet this guest, you return and sigh. Why?\"\n\nHe said: \"I have already told you: the people of the Central States are enlightened in ritual and righteousness but coarse in understanding the human heart. The one who saw me before advanced and retreated as if bound by compass and square, conducted himself as if a dragon or a tiger. He admonished me like a son, guided me like a father. That is why I sighed.\"\n\nConfucius saw him and did not speak. Zilu said: \"You have long wished to see Wen Bo Xuezi. Now that you have seen him, why do you not speak?\"\n\nConfucius said: \"With such a man, the Dao is present the moment one’s eyes meet. There is no room for words.\"\n\n---\n\nYan Yuan asked Confucius: \"When you walk, I walk; when you hasten, I hasten; when you run, I run. But when you race ahead, leaving all dust behind, I can only stare blankly from behind.\"\n\nConfucius said: \"Hui, what do you mean?\"\n\nYan Yuan said: \"When you walk, I walk; when you speak, I speak; when you hasten, I hasten; when you debate, I debate; when you run, I run; when you speak of the Dao, I speak of the Dao. Yet when you race ahead, leaving all dust behind, and I can only stare blankly from behind—you do not speak yet are trusted, do not compare yet are all-encompassing, have no vessel yet the people tread before you, and I do not know why.\"\n\nConfucius said: \"Alas! How can this not be examined? There is no greater sorrow than the death of the heart, and the death of the person is secondary to it. The sun rises in the east and sets in the west. All things align with it: those with eyes and feet depend on it to succeed. When it rises, they exist; when it sets, they perish. All things are thus: some depend on it to die, some depend on it to live. Once I received my completed form, I did not transform but awaited its end, moving in accord with things, day and night without pause, yet not knowing where it would lead—so naturally my form was completed. Knowing fate, I cannot plan for what lies ahead. I have followed you all my life, grasped your arm for an instant, and lost it—how can this not be sorrowful?\"",

Let me try to describe it for you. The utmost yin is solemn and still; the utmost yang is blazing and bright. Solemn stillness arises from heaven; blazing brightness issues from earth. The two intermingle and harmonize, and things are born. Some pattern governs this, yet no form is seen. They wax and wane, fill and empty, now dark, now bright, changing day by day, month by month, acting without cease, yet no trace of their work is seen. Life has its source from which it sprouts; death has its place to which it returns. Beginning and end revolve without end, yet none know where it will cease.

To attain the utmost beauty and wander in the utmost joy—this is called the Perfected Person.\"\n\nConfucius said: \"I would like to hear the method.\"\n\nLao Dan said: \"Herbivorous beasts do not fret over changing marshes; aquatic creatures do not fret over changing waters. They undergo few changes yet do not lose their great constancy. Joy and anger, sorrow and happiness do not enter the breast. The world is where the myriad things are one. If you attain this oneness and become the same as it, then your four limbs and hundred parts will be but dust and dirt, and death and life, end and beginning will be like day and night—nothing can disturb them, much less the distinctions of gain and loss, fortune and misfortune. Those who cast off such concerns are like those who discard mud and mire, knowing the body is more precious than such things. What is precious resides in me and is not lost in change. Moreover, the myriad transformations have never had an end—what could trouble the heart?

After three years, King Wen surveyed the state and found that the ranks of scholars had dispersed, their factions dissolved; officials no longer cultivated virtue; and measures of grain dared not enter from the four borders. The dispersal of scholars and factions meant unity of purpose; officials’ failure to cultivate virtue meant shared endeavor; the refusal of grain tribute from the borders meant the lords harbored no divided loyalties.\n\nKing Wen then made him Grand Preceptor, facing north to inquire: \"Can this governance extend to all under Heaven?\" The old man of Zang gave no response, his words drifting away, and by nightfall he had fled, never to be heard of again.\n\nYan Yuan asked Confucius: \"Was King Wen still deluded?

You and I will never be close to the truth because we know.\"\n\nKuang Qu heard this and took the Yellow Emperor to be one who knew the words.\n\nHeaven and earth possess great beauty yet do not speak. The four seasons follow clear patterns yet do not debate. The myriad things have their inherent principles yet do not explain. The sage traces the beauty of heaven and earth and comprehends the principles of the myriad things. Thus the perfected man does nothing, the great sage takes no action—this is called observing heaven and earth.\n\nNow that numinous brightness and utmost refinement, along with the hundred transformations—whether things die or live, take shape or become round—none know their root. Yet all things have existed since ancient times, secure in themselves. The Six Directions are vast, yet they do not depart from its bounds; the tip of an autumn hair is minute, yet it depends on this to exist. In the world, nothing does not sink or float, yet nothing remains unchanged throughout life. Yin and yang and the four seasons move in their courses, each keeping to its proper order. Vast and indistinct, it seems to vanish yet remains; flowing and formless, it is spirit. The myriad things are nurtured by it yet do not know. This is called the root and foundation—by it one may observe heaven.\n\nNie Que asked Dao of Bei Yi. Bei Yi said: \"Straighten your form, unify your gaze, and the harmony of heaven will arrive. Gather in your knowledge, unify your measures, and spirit will come to dwell. Virtue will adorn you, the Dao will be your abode. Your eyes will be bright as a newborn calf’s, seeking nothing of the past.\"\n\nBefore the words were finished, Nie Que fell asleep. Bei Yi rejoiced greatly and walked away singing, saying: \"His form like withered bones, his heart like dead ashes, truly he knows the real. Not clinging to the past, vague and obscure, without mind—none can scheme with him. What manner of man is this?\"\n\nShun asked Cheng: \"Can the Dao be possessed?\" Cheng said: \"Your body is not your own—how can you possess the Dao?\" Shun said: \"If my body is not my own, then whose is it?\" Cheng said: \"It is heaven and earth’s entrusted form. Life is not your own—it is heaven and earth’s entrusted harmony. Nature and destiny are not your own—they are heaven and earth’s entrusted compliance. Children and grandchildren are not your own—they are heaven and earth’s entrusted shedding. Thus when you walk, you do not know where you are going; when you dwell, you do not know what you are holding; when you eat, you do not know the taste.

      "translated_text": "The radiant emerges from the obscure, the ordered from the formless; spirit arises from the Dao, and form originates from essence. All things beget one another through form—thus creatures with nine orifices are born from the womb, and those with eight from the egg. Their coming knows no nearness, their going no boundary; no gate, no chamber, yet they extend boundlessly in all four directions. Those who roam here have limbs of strength, thoughts that penetrate, ears and eyes keen—yet their minds exert no labor, and their responses to things know no fixed pattern. Heaven cannot but be high, earth cannot but be vast, sun and moon cannot but move, and the myriad things cannot but flourish—such is the Dao.\n\nMoreover, vast learning does not necessarily bring knowledge, nor eloquence wisdom; the sage has already settled this. As for that which, when augmented, does not increase, and when diminished, does not decrease—this is what the sage preserves. Profound as the sea, towering in its endless return to the beginning, it measures and sustains the ten thousand things without exhaustion. Thus the Dao of the noble person lies beyond such distinctions. All things turn to it for sustenance yet are never depleted—such is the Dao.\n\nThere is a being within the central realm, neither yin nor yang, dwelling between heaven and earth, merely human for a time, yet destined to return to its origin. Viewed from its root, life is but the dark fermentation of things. Though lifespans vary, how great is the difference? A mere moment’s discourse. Why then debate the right and wrong of Yao and Jie? The fruit of the fern has its pattern, and human relations, though complex, follow their order. The sage encounters them without resistance, passes them without clinging. To harmonize and respond is virtue; to coincide and respond is the Dao. This is what empowers emperors and gives rise to kings.\n\nHuman life between heaven and earth is like a white colt passing a gap—suddenly, it is gone. Bursting forth, all things emerge; gently dispersing, all things return. Having transformed and lived, they transform again and die. Living creatures mourn them, humankind grieves. Loosening heaven’s bonds, unraveling its threads, in swirling confusion they drift—soul and spirit depart, and the body follows, returning to the great homecoming. The formless taking form, form dissolving into the formless—this all people know, yet it is not the concern of those who attain the Dao. This is what the common crowd debates. Those who attain do not debate; those who debate do not attain. Clear insight finds no value; eloquence is not as good as silence. The Dao cannot be heard; hearing it is not as good as blocking it—this is called the great attainment.\n\nDongguo Zi asked Zhuangzi: \"Where does the so-called Dao reside?\"\nZhuangzi said: \"It is nowhere absent.\"\nDongguo Zi said: \"You must specify.\"\nZhuangzi said: \"It is in the ants.\"\nDongguo Zi said: \"Why so low?\"\nZhuangzi said: \"It is in the millet stalks.\"\nDongguo Zi said: \"Why even lower?\"\nZhuangzi said: \"It is in the tiles and shards.\"\nDongguo Zi said: \"Why still lower?\"\nZhuangzi said: \"It is in excrement and urine.\"\nDongguo Zi did not respond.\nZhuangzi said: \"Your question fundamentally misses the essence. When Zheng Huo asked the market inspector about the fat content of a pig, the lower the part, the clearer the answer. You must not insist on a fixed place—nothing escapes the Dao. The supreme Dao is like this, and so too is great speech. *Zhou*, *bian*, and *xian*—these three are different names for the same reality, pointing to the one.\n\nOnce, wandering together in the Palace of Nothing-Whatsoever, we merged in discussion without end. Once, dwelling together in non-action—serene and still, vast and clear, harmonious and at ease. My will was empty, and though I went forth, I knew not where I arrived; though I departed and returned, I knew not where I stopped. I had already come and gone yet knew not where it would end. Wandering in the boundless, great knowledge enters yet knows no limit. That which gives form to things is not bounded by things, yet things have boundaries—what we call the boundaries of things are the boundaries of non-boundary, the boundary of the unbounded.\n\nWe speak of fullness and emptiness, decline and decay, yet that which is full and empty is not full and empty; that which declines and decays is not decline and decay. That which is root and branch is not root and branch; that which accumulates and disperses is not accumulation and dispersal.\"\n\nKuang He Gan and Shen Nong studied together under Old Dragon Ji. One day, Shen Nong was dozing with the door closed when Kuang He Gan burst in at noon, shouting: \"Old Dragon is dead!\"\nShen Nong, leaning on his staff, rose with a start, then tossed it aside and laughed, saying: \"Heaven knew my stubbornness and arrogance, so it cast me aside and let him die.

How much more so with people today? The sage dwells among things without harming them. One who does not harm things—things cannot harm them. Only one who harms nothing can send off and welcome others. Mountains and forests, hills and plains—do they not make me joyful and glad? Yet before the joy is complete, sorrow follows. Joy and sorrow come—I cannot resist them; they depart—I cannot stop them. Alas! People of the world are but lodgers in the realm of things. They know what they encounter but not what they do not; they know what they can do but not what they cannot. To be without knowledge, without ability—this is something no one can avoid. Yet to strive to avoid what no one can avoid—is this not also lamentable? The ultimate word leaves words behind; the ultimate act leaves acts behind.

He went north to dwell on Mount Weilü. Those among his retainers who were clever and knowing departed; those among his concubines who were soft and benevolent kept their distance. Only the hunchbacked and the idle remained to serve him. After three years, Weilü flourished.\n\nThe people of Weilü said to one another: \"When Master Gengsang first arrived, we were struck by his difference. Now, when we reckon our days, we find them lacking; when we reckon our years, we find them abundant. He must be a sage. Why do we not together offer him sacrifices as to an ancestral spirit, and worship him as we do the gods of soil and grain?\"\n\nGengsang Chu heard this and, facing south, remained unsettled.\nHis disciples found this strange.\nGengsang Chu said: \"Disciples, why do you find me strange? When spring’s qi arises, the hundred grasses grow; when autumn’s season arrives, the myriad treasures ripen. Do spring and autumn not act without purpose? The Dao of Heaven has already unfolded. I have heard that the perfected person dwells like a corpse in a walled hut, while the common people run wild, not knowing where to turn.

The beast that fills a carriage, once parted from the mountain and encased in armor, cannot escape the snares and nets; the fish that swallows a boat, once beached and deprived of water, may be vexed by ants. Thus birds and beasts do not weary of the heights, and fish and turtles do not weary of the depths. The man who preserves his form and life hides himself, and does not weary of the profound and distant—this alone suffices. As for those two, how could they be worthy of praise? In their disputations, they would recklessly hack at walls to plant mugwort and wormwood. Combing their hair to a fine sheen, counting grains of rice to cook—how could such petty acts save the age? When the worthy are raised up, the people contend; when cunning is employed, the people steal. These few things are not enough to enrich the people. The people are ever eager for gain: sons kill fathers, ministers kill rulers, in broad daylight they turn to robbery, at midday they bore through walls. I tell you, the root of great disorder must arise in the age of Yao and Shun, and its branches will endure for a thousand generations. A thousand generations hence, there will surely be men who devour one another.\"\n\nNanrong Chu straightened his robes, sat upright, and said: \"At my age, I am already advanced in years—how can I entrust my work and attain this cultivation?\"\n\nGengsang Chu said: \"Preserve your form, embrace your life, and do not let your thoughts and cares run wild. If you can do this for two years, you may reach this state.\"\n\nNanrong Chu said: \"The eye and the form—I do not see them as different, yet the blind cannot see themselves; the ear and the form—I do not see them as different, yet the deaf cannot hear themselves; the heart and the form—I do not see them as different, yet the mad cannot grasp themselves. The form and the form are set apart—could it be that things intervene? Do they seek one another yet fail to find? Now you tell me: preserve your form, embrace your life, do not let your thoughts and cares run wild. I have striven to hear the Dao and let it reach my ears.\"\n\nGengsang Chu said: \"My words are exhausted. The wasp of the day cannot transform the chrysalis of the night; the chicken of Yue cannot hatch the egg of the swan—only the chicken of Lu can do so. Chickens and chickens—their virtue is not different, yet some can and some cannot, for their capacities are inherently great or small. Now my capacity is small and insufficient to transform you. Why do you not go south to see Laozi?\"\n\nNanrong Chu prepared provisions, and after seven days and seven nights arrived at Laozi’s abode.\n\nLaozi said: \"Have you come from Chu?\"\n\nNanrong Chu said: \"Yes.\"\n\nLaozi said: \"Why have you come with so many people?\"\n\nNanrong Chu, startled, looked behind him.\n\nLaozi said: \"Do you not understand what I mean?\"\n\nNanrong Chu bowed his head in shame, then looked up and sighed: \"Now I have forgotten my answer and so lost my question.\"\n\nLaozi said: \"What do you mean?\"\n\nNanrong Chu said: \"If I am ignorant, people call me a fool. If I am wise, it only brings sorrow to my body. Without benevolence, I harm others; with benevolence, I bring sorrow upon myself. Without righteousness, I injure others; with righteousness, I bring sorrow upon myself. How can I escape this? These three sayings are my afflictions. I wish to rely on you to resolve them.\"\n\nLaozi said: \"A moment ago, I saw between your brows, and thereby understood you. Now you speak again and confirm it. You are as one who has lost his parents, holding up a pole to seek them in the sea. You are lost indeed, bewildered! You wish to return to your nature and disposition yet have no way in—how pitiable!\"\n\nNanrong Chu begged to enter and receive instruction. He summoned what he loved and cast aside what he despised. After ten days of self-torment, he again saw Laozi.\n\nLaozi said: \"You have cleansed yourself—how dense and troubled you still are! Yet within, you seethe as if still harboring resentment. He who is bound without cannot be restrained by force, for he will grow stronger within; he who is constrained within cannot be seized by deception, for he will lash out without. He who is bound both without and within cannot be upheld by the Dao and virtue—how much less one who abandons the Dao and acts on his own?\"\n\nNanrong Chu said: \"When a villager is ill, and the villagers ask after him, if the sick man can describe his illness, then though he suffers, he is not yet truly ill. As for my hearing of the great Dao, it is like taking medicine that only worsens the disease. I wish only to hear the classic of preserving life.\"\n\nLaozi said: \"The classic of preserving life—can you embrace the One? Can you not lose it? Can you know good and ill without divination? Can you stop? Can you cease? Can you set aside others and seek within yourself? Can you be supple? Can you be yielding? Can you be like a child? The child wails all day yet its throat does not grow hoarse—so perfect is its harmony; it clenches its fist all day yet its hand does not cramp—so complete is its virtue; it gazes all day yet its eyes do not blink—its focus is not on externals. It walks without knowing where it goes, dwells without knowing what it does, drifts with things and moves with the current—this is the classic of preserving life.\"\n\nNanrong Chu said: \"Then is this the virtue of the perfected person?\"\n\nLaozi said: \"No.\"",

      "translated_text": "This is what is called \"melting like ice, dissolving like frost.\"\n\nThe perfected person shares sustenance with the earth and rejoices with heaven, not entangled by the gains and losses of others, not engaging in strangeness, not scheming together, not acting in concert. Supple they depart, yielding they arrive—this is the classic of preserving life.\n\nNanrong Chu said: \"Then is this perfection?\"\n\nLaozi said: \"Not yet. I have already told you: can you be like a child? The child moves without knowing what it does, walks without knowing where it goes, its body like the branch of a withered tree, its heart like dead ashes. In such a state, misfortune does not arrive, nor does fortune come. With neither misfortune nor fortune, how could there be human calamity?\n\nWhen the cosmos is at peace and settled, it emits the light of heaven. Those who emit the light of heaven are seen as human. Those who cultivate themselves now possess constancy; those who possess constancy are abandoned by others yet aided by heaven. Those abandoned by others are called the people of heaven; those aided by heaven are called the sons of heaven.\n\nThe learner learns what cannot be learned; the doer does what cannot be done; the debater debates what cannot be debated. To know when to stop at what cannot be known—this is the ultimate. If there are those who do not conform to this, the balance of heaven will destroy them.\n\nPrepare things to sustain the form, conceal the unforeseen to nurture the heart, revere the center to reach the other. If despite this, myriad evils still arrive, they are from heaven, not from man—they cannot disturb completion or enter the numinous terrace. The numinous terrace holds something yet does not know what it holds, and there is that which cannot be held.\n\nIf one does not see the sincerity within oneself and acts, each act is inappropriate; if karma enters and does not depart, each change brings loss. Those who do evil in the light are punished by others; those who do evil in the dark are punished by spirits. Only those who are enlightened about others and enlightened about spirits can walk alone.\n\nThose who hold inner bonds act without fame; those who hold outer bonds aspire to stipulated rewards. Acting without fame, only the mediocre gain luster; aspiring to stipulated rewards, they are but merchants—others see their divergence as towering. Those who exhaust things are entered by things; those who contend with things cannot even contain themselves, how can they contain others? Those who cannot contain others have no intimacy; those with no intimacy are forsaken by all.\n\nNo weapon is more invasive than the will—even the *mo* and *zou* blades are inferior. No enemy is greater than yin and yang, from which there is no escape within heaven and earth. It is not that yin and yang harm them, but that the heart commands it.\n\nThe Dao flows through. Its division is its completion, its completion is its destruction. What is detestable about division is that it divides in order to prepare; what is detestable about preparation is that it prepares for something. Thus, to depart and not return is to see one’s ghost; to depart and obtain is called obtaining death. To perish yet have substance is one kind of ghost.\n\nBy using the formed to model the formless, one may attain stability. Departing without root, entering without aperture. Having substance yet no place, having length yet no beginning or end, having an exit yet no aperture—this is having substance. Having substance yet no place is space. Having length yet no beginning or end is time. There is life, there is death, there is departure, there is entry. Departing and entering without seeing its form—this is called the Gate of Heaven. The Gate of Heaven is Nonbeing. The myriad things emerge from Nonbeing. Being cannot use being to create being; it must emerge from Nonbeing, and Nonbeing is no Nonbeing.\n\nThe sage conceals himself therein.\n\nThe ancients—some of their knowledge reached the utmost. To what extent? Some believed there had never yet been things—this is the utmost, the ultimate, beyond which nothing can be added. Next were those who believed things existed, taking life as loss and death as return—thus they were already divided. Next were those who said: first there was Nonbeing, then there was life, and life swiftly became death. They took Nonbeing as the head, life as the body, and death as the corpse. Who knows the one who guards the unity of being, nonbeing, life, and death? I would befriend such a one.\n\nThough these three differ, they belong to the same clan—like the *Zhao* and *Jing* lineages, the *Zhu* and *Dai* families, the *Jia* clan, the *Zhu* and *Feng* houses—not one and the same. There is life, like a sealed letter, unfolding day by day. I have spoken of this unfolding, but it is not what I meant. Nevertheless, it cannot be known.\n\nThe victory of the *la* sacrifice can be dispersed yet cannot be dispersed. The observer of a chamber is thorough in the ancestral temple, but what of its collapse? This is to cite the unfolding. Let me speak constantly of this unfolding.\n\nThus, taking life as the root and knowledge as the teacher, one rides upon right and wrong, resulting in names and realities. Taking oneself as the standard, one makes others conform to one’s own measure, using death to repay one’s principles. Those who act thus use action as wisdom, non-action as foolishness, thoroughness as fame, and poverty as disgrace—this unfolding is the way of people today, like the cicada and the fledgling dove in their sameness.\n\nIf you tread on a market-goer’s foot, you apologize with alarm; if it is an elder brother, you soothe him; if it is a parent, you stop at that. Thus it is said: the utmost ritual does not involve others, the utmost righteousness does not involve things, the utmost knowledge does not scheme, the utmost benevolence has no intimacy, the utmost trust dispenses with metal.\n\nBreak the fervor of the will, untie the knots of the heart, cast off the burdens of virtue, clear the blockages of the Dao. Wealth, honor, prominence, dignity, fame, and profit—these six stir the will. Appearance, movement, complexion, pattern, qi, and intent—these six entangle the heart. Aversion, desire, joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness—these six burden virtue. Advancement, retreat, taking, giving, knowledge, and ability—these six obstruct the Dao. When these four sets of six do not agitate the breast, one is upright; upright, one is tranquil; tranquil, one is luminous; luminous, one is empty; empty, one does nothing yet nothing is left undone.\n\nThe Dao is the reverence of virtue.",

      "translated_text": "Life is the radiance of virtue; nature is the essence of life. The movement of nature is called action; the artificiality of action is called loss.\n\n\"Likeness\" is connection; \"knowledge\" is planning. What knowledge does not know is like a sidelong glance. Movement from inevitability is called virtue; movement without self is called governance. Names may oppose each other, yet realities align.\n\nYi excelled at hitting the subtle mark yet was clumsy at preventing others from praising him. The sage excels at Heaven yet is clumsy with men.

If one takes the world as one’s cage, then no sparrow can escape. Thus Tang used a kitchen servant to enclose Yi Yin, and Duke Mu of Qin used five sheepskins to enclose Bai Li Xi. Therefore, if one does not use what they love to enclose them, nothing can be obtained.\n\nThe crippled man flaunts his adornments, rejecting external praise and blame. The convict climbs high without fear, having abandoned life and death. To return to speech without offering and forget others—by forgetting others, one thereby becomes a Heavenly person. Thus, one who is revered yet feels no joy, or insulted yet feels no anger, is one who harmonizes with Heaven’s harmony.\n\nWhen anger arises from non-anger, then anger emerges from non-anger. When action arises from non-action, then action emerges from non-action. To desire stillness, level the qi; to desire spirit, follow the heart. In action, to desire appropriateness, adhere to inevitability. The category of inevitability is the Way of the sage.\n\n---\n\n*Master Xu Wugui*, through Lady Shang, was received by Marquis Wu of Wei. The marquis greeted him, saying, \"Master, you are weary—wearied by the toil of mountains and forests, and thus willing to see me.\"\n\nXu Wugui replied, \"It is I who weary you—what weariness have you for me? If you indulge your desires and prolong your likes and dislikes, the essence of your nature and life will sicken. If you suppress your desires and learn your likes and dislikes, your ears and eyes will sicken. I would weary you—what weariness have you for me?\"\n\nThe marquis, startled, made no reply. After a moment, Xu Wugui said, \"Let me tell you: I read dogs. The inferior dog stops at being full—this is the virtue of a wildcat. The middling dog looks as if watching the sun; the superior dog seems to have lost its unity. But my reading of dogs is not as good as my reading of horses.\n\nIn my reading of horses, the straight align with the plumb line, the curved with the hook, the square with the carpenter’s square, the round with the compass—these are the state’s horses, yet they do not compare to the world’s horses. The world’s horses have perfect material: seeming anxious, seeming lost, as if they have forgotten their unity. Such horses surpass all, leaving no trace—one cannot know where they go.\"\n\nThe marquis was greatly pleased and laughed. When Xu Wugui left, Lady Shang asked, \"Master, how did you alone delight my lord? Those who please my lord do so by expounding the *Odes*, *Documents*, *Rites*, and *Music* in breadth, or by citing the *Golden Tablets and Six Strategies* in depth. Those who serve him with great merit are countless, yet my lord has never once smiled. How did you delight him so?\"\n\nXu Wugui said, \"I simply told him how I read dogs and horses.\"\n\nLady Shang said, \"Is that all?\"\n\nHe replied, \"Have you not heard of the exiles of Yue? After a few days away from their state, they rejoice at seeing those they know. After a month, they rejoice at seeing those they once saw in their state. After a year, they rejoice even at seeing those who resemble people. Is it not that the longer one is away from others, the deeper the longing for them?\n\nThose who flee into the void tread the paths of foxes and weasels, treading lightly in the emptiness. When they hear the sound of human footsteps, they rejoice—how much more when brothers and kin drink and feast beside them! For too long, no one has offered my lord the medicine of a true person’s words by his side.\"\n\nXu Wugui later saw the marquis, who said, \"Master, you dwell in the mountains and forests, eating taro and chestnuts, disdaining onions and leeks, yet you deign to visit me—how long it has been! Are you now old? Do you crave the taste of wine and meat? Or do you bring blessings to my altars of soil and grain?\"\n\nXu Wugui replied, \"I, Wugui, was born poor and lowly and have never dared to taste your wine and meat. I came to weary you.\"\n\nThe marquis said, \"How so? Why weary me?\"\n\nHe replied, \"To weary your spirit and form.\"",

      "translated_text": "The marquis said, \"What do you mean?\"\n\nXu Wugui replied, \"The nurturing of Heaven and Earth is one. Ascending high does not make one tall, nor does dwelling low make one short. Yet you alone, as lord of ten thousand chariots, bring suffering to the people of your state to nourish your ears, eyes, nose, and mouth—your spirit does not consent to this. The spirit delights in harmony and detests perversity. Perversity is a sickness, and so I weary you. It is only your sickness that wearies you—why is this?\"\n\nThe marquis said, \"I have long wished to meet you. I wish to love the people and practice righteousness by laying down arms—would this be possible?\"\n\nXu Wugui said, \"It would not. Loving the people is the beginning of harming them; practicing righteousness and laying down arms is the root of creating arms. If you proceed thus, you will likely not succeed. All completed beauty is a dangerous tool. Though you act with benevolence and righteousness, you will nearly become false. Form inevitably produces form, completion inevitably invites attack, and change inevitably brings external strife. You must not array grand cranes in the towers of your palace, nor parade fine steeds in the courtyards of your halls. Do not store resentment in your gains, do not overcome others with skill, do not overcome others with schemes, do not overcome others with war. Those who kill the people’s soldiers and seize others’ lands to nourish their own desires and spirits—how can one know which side is good in such a war? Where does victory lie? If you cannot stop, cultivate sincerity within your heart to respond to the feelings of Heaven and Earth, and do not obstruct them. The people are already dead and free—how will you use the laying down of arms?\n\nOnce, the Yellow Emperor wished to visit Great Vision on Mount Juci. Fangming drove his chariot, Changyu rode as attendant, Zhangruo and Weipeng led the horses, while Kunhe and Guji followed in the rear carriage. When they reached the wilds of Xiangcheng, the Seven Sages all lost their way and had nowhere to ask directions. They happened upon a boy herding horses and asked him the way. The boy said, 'Do you know Mount Juci?' 'Yes,' they replied. 'Do you know where Great Vision dwells?' 'Yes,' he said. The Yellow Emperor exclaimed, 'How extraordinary, this little boy! Not only does he know Mount Juci, but he also knows where Great Vision dwells. Allow me to ask how to govern the world.' The boy said, 'Governing the world is just like this—what more is there to do? When I was young, I roamed freely within the Six Directions. Then I fell ill with a sudden affliction, and an elder taught me, saying, \"Ride the sun’s chariot and roam the wilds of Xiangcheng.\" Now that my illness has slightly improved, I am about to roam beyond the Six Directions again.

      "translated_text": "The Yellow Emperor said, \"Governing the world is truly not your concern. Nevertheless, allow me to ask about governing the world.\" The boy declined. The Yellow Emperor asked again. The boy said, \"What makes governing the world different from herding horses? It is merely a matter of removing what harms the horses.\" The Yellow Emperor bowed twice, touching his forehead to the ground, and called him \"Heavenly Master\" before withdrawing.\n\nThe contemplative scholar finds no joy without the vicissitudes of thought, the eloquent scholar finds no joy without the order of discourse, and the scrutinizing scholar finds no joy without the sting of reproach—all are confined by things.\n\nThose who summon the age to court, the common folk who covet office, the strong who boast of hardship, the brave who rush into peril, warriors who delight in battle, recluses who cling to fame, legalists who expand governance, ritualists who refine demeanor, and the benevolent who value connections—each has their place.\n\nFarmers find no fellowship without the toil of clearing fields, merchants find no fellowship without the bustle of markets. Common folk are spurred by daily labor, artisans take pride in their tools’ craftsmanship. Without accumulating wealth, the greedy grow anxious; without surpassing power, the proud grow sorrowful. Those who delight in change seize the moment when it serves them, yet cannot remain inactive. All these follow the turning of the seasons, unyielding to transformation.\n\nThey exhaust their nature, submerge themselves in the ten thousand things, and never return for the rest of their lives—how lamentable!\n\nZhuangzi said, \"If an archer hits the mark without aiming, we call him a skilled shot. If everyone in the world were like Yi, would that be acceptable?\"\nHuizi said, \"It would.\"\nZhuangzi said, \"If the world had no shared standard of rightness, and each affirmed only what they deemed right, would it be acceptable for everyone in the world to be like Yao?\"\nHuizi said, \"It would.\"\nZhuangzi said, \"Then among the Confucians, Mohists, Yangists, and Bingists—four schools—and you, making five, which one is truly right? Or is it like the case of Lu Ju? His disciple said, 'I have grasped the Master’s Way! I can boil a cauldron in winter and make ice in summer.' Lu Ju said, 'This merely summons yang with yang and yin with yin—it is not what I call the Way. Let me show you my Way.' Thereupon, he tuned a zither, placing one in the hall and one in the chamber. When he plucked the *gong* note, the *gong* note resonated; when he plucked the *jiao* note, the *jiao* note resonated—their harmonies were identical. But if he adjusted one string so that it no longer fit the five notes and plucked it, all twenty-five strings vibrated, yet the sound was not distinct from the rest, though it became the ruler of the tones. Is this not akin to your case?\"\nHuizi said, \"Now the Confucians, Mohists, Yangists, and Bingists all contend with me in debate, clashing in words and overpowering in voice, yet none have ever proven me wrong. How does this compare?\"\nZhuangzi said, \"A man from Qi who lost his son in Song had a fate that was not whole; when he sought a lost bell, he bound it tightly; when he sought Tang’s son, he never left his domain—he left something behind. A man from Chu who lodged in a place where arrows were stored met with boatmen at midnight in a deserted land. Though he never left the cliff, he was enough to incur resentment.\n\nZhuangzi, while attending a funeral, passed by Huizi’s grave. Turning to his followers, he said, \"A man from Ying had plaster splattered on the tip of his nose, as thin as a fly’s wing. He had Carpenter Shi shave it off. Carpenter Shi swung his axe with the force of the wind, listening as he struck, removing all the plaster without harming the nose. The man from Ying stood unmoved. When the Lord of Song Yuan heard of this, he summoned Carpenter Shi and said, 'Try to do it for me.' Carpenter Shi replied, 'Your servant once could do this, but the material for my skill has long been dead. Since the Master’s passing, I have had no one to work with—I have no one to speak to.'\"\n\nWhen Guan Zhong fell ill, Duke Huan asked him, \"Your illness has grown severe. If it worsens, to whom should I entrust the state?\" Guan Zhong said, \"Whom does the Duke wish to appoint?\" The Duke said, \"Bao Shuya.\" Guan Zhong said, \"No. He is a meticulous and upright gentleman. Those who do not measure up to him, he does not associate with. Once he hears of someone’s fault, he never forgets it. If he governed the state, he would soon offend the ruler above and alienate the people below. It would not be long before he incurred the Duke’s displeasure.\" The Duke said, \"Then who is suitable?\" Guan Zhong replied, \"If you must choose, then Yang Peng will do. His character is such that he forgets those above and rebels against those below. He feels ashamed of not being like the Yellow Emperor and pities those who do not measure up to himself. To distribute virtue is called sageliness; to distribute wealth is called worthiness. To rule others with worthiness never wins their hearts; to humble oneself with worthiness never fails to win them. He is deaf to affairs of state and blind to matters of the household. If you must choose, then Yang Peng will do.\"\n\nKing Wu was floating on the river and ascended Mount Ju. The troop of monkeys, seeing him, fled in alarm and hid in the dense thickets. One monkey, however, lingered, swinging its arms and scratching, displaying its skill before the king. The king shot at it, and the monkey deftly caught the swift arrow. The king ordered his attendants to rush forward and shoot, and the monkey was seized and killed. The king turned to his friend Yan Buyi and said, \"This monkey relied on its skill and agility to defy me, bringing about its own demise. Take heed! Alas, do not let your demeanor make you arrogant toward others.\" Yan Buyi returned home and studied under Dong Wu to uproot his arrogance. He renounced pleasure and declined fame. After three years, the people of the state praised him.\n\nNanbo Zijing sat leaning on his armrest, gazing at the sky and sighing. Yan Chengzi entered and said, \"Master, you are the most extraordinary of beings. Can the body truly be made like withered bones, the heart like dead ashes?\" He replied, \"Once I dwelled in a mountain cave. At that time, when the fields of Qi caught a glimpse of me, the people of the state all celebrated three times.\"",

      "translated_text": "I must precede them, and thus they know it; I must offer it, and thus they purify themselves for it. If I did not possess it, how could they know it? If I did not offer it, how could they purify themselves for it? Alas! I grieve for those who lose themselves, and I grieve again for those who grieve for them, and I grieve yet again for those who grieve for the grief of others—ever receding with each passing day.\n\nWhen Confucius traveled to Chu, the king of Chu offered him wine. Sunshu Ao stood holding the goblet, while Shinan Yiliao received the wine and made an offering, saying, \"Men of old have spoken of this.\" Confucius replied, \"I have heard of the speech that is without words, yet I have never spoken of it—until now.\" Shinan Yiliao juggled his balls to resolve the feud between two families, while Sunshu Ao slept soundly, holding a feather fan, and the people of Ying laid down their weapons. Confucius wished for a beak three feet long.\n\nWhat they call the Dao that is not the Dao, this is what I call the eloquence of wordlessness. Thus virtue gathers where the Dao is one. And speech rests where knowledge knows no more—this is perfection. Where the Dao is one, virtue cannot be the same; where knowledge knows no more, eloquence cannot encompass it. Names like those of the Confucians and Mohists bring only misfortune.\n\nThus the sea does not refuse the streams that flow into it—such is its greatness. The sage embraces heaven and earth, bestowing blessings upon the world, yet no one knows his name. Therefore, in life he holds no rank, in death he leaves no wealth; he does not accumulate goods, nor does he establish a name—this is what is called the Great Man.\n\nA dog is not good because it barks well, nor is a man worthy because he speaks well—how much less so for one who is great! To be great is not enough to be called great—how much less so for virtue! Greatness is complete, yet nothing compares to heaven and earth. What do they seek, and yet are complete? One who knows completeness seeks nothing, loses nothing, discards nothing, and does not let things alter his true self. Turning inward without exhaustion, following the ancient without friction—this is the sincerity of the Great Man.\n\nMaster Jing had eight sons. He lined them up before him and summoned Jiufang Yan, saying, \"Examine my sons for me and tell me which one is most auspicious.\" Jiufang Yan replied, \"Kun is the most auspicious.\" Master Jing started in surprise and joy, asking, \"In what way?\" Jiufang Yan said, \"Kun will share the ruler’s table and feast for the rest of his life.\" Master Jing’s face fell, and tears welled up as he said, \"What has my son done to reach such an extreme?\" Jiufang Yan replied, \"One who shares the ruler’s table brings blessings to three clans—how much more so to his parents! Now that you have heard this and weep, you reject good fortune. Your son is auspicious, but you are not.\"\n\nMaster Jing said, \"Yan, how could you possibly know that Kun is auspicious? His fate is bound to meat and wine, entering only his nose and mouth—how could you know where it comes from? I have never herded cattle, yet a calf was born in the inner chamber; I have never hunted, yet a quail hatched in the granary. If you find this strange, why? Those with whom I associate wander between heaven and earth. With them, I roam in joy beneath the sky and feast upon the earth. I do not involve myself in their affairs, nor do I scheme with them, nor do I share in their strange omens. I ride the sincerity of heaven and earth without letting things entangle me; I drift with them, unburdened by worldly concerns. Now, suddenly, there is this worldly reward. Whenever there are strange signs, there must be strange conduct. Alas, this is not the fault of my son or me—it is heaven’s doing! That is why I weep.\"\n\nBefore long, Kun was sent to Yan. Bandits seized him on the road. To keep him whole and offer him as a sacrifice would be difficult; to cut off his foot would be easier. So they cut off his foot and presented him as a treasure to the state of Qi, where he ended up at Duke Qu’s gate, eating meat for the rest of his life.\n\nNie Que met Xu You and asked, \"Where are you going?\" Xu You replied, \"I am fleeing from Yao.\" Nie Que asked, \"Why?\" Xu You said, \"Yao is so earnestly benevolent that I fear he will be ridiculed by the world. Future generations may even turn to cannibalism. The people are not hard to gather: love them, and they draw near; benefit them, and they come; praise them, and they are encouraged; bring them what they hate, and they scatter. Love and benefit arise from benevolence and righteousness, but those who abandon benevolence and righteousness are few, while those who profit from them are many. The practice of benevolence and righteousness lacks sincerity—it is merely a tool for the greedy and rapacious. Thus, one man’s judgment brings profit to the world, yet it is like a single glance. Yao knows that worthy men benefit the world, but he does not know that they also harm it. Only those outside the realm of worthiness understand this.\"\n\nThere are those who are *nuanmei*, those who are *runxu*, and those who are *juanlou*. The *nuanmei* learn the words of a single master and delight in them privately, believing themselves sufficient, unaware that nothing has truly begun—this is what is called *nuanmei*. The *runxu* are like lice on a pig: they choose the sparse bristles and think it a vast palace, nestling between the hooves and thighs, believing it a safe and comfortable dwelling. They do not know that one day the butcher will roll up his sleeves, spread straw, and light a fire, and they will burn along with the pig. They advance and retreat within their narrow domain—this is what is called *runxu*. The *juanlou* is like Shun. Mutton does not long for ants, but ants long for mutton because mutton has a strong scent. Shun had a rank odor in his conduct, and the people delighted in him. Thus, he moved three times, and each time his settlement grew, until at Deng’s ruins he had a hundred thousand households. Yao, hearing of Shun’s worthiness, raised him from the barren land, saying, \"I hope to benefit from his presence.\" Shun was raised from the barren land, and as his years and teeth grew long, his hearing and sight declined, yet he could not retire—this is what is called *juanlou*.\n\nThus, the spirit-like man dislikes the multitude’s arrival, for when the multitude arrives, they do not harmonize, and when they do not harmonize, no benefit comes of it.",

Man’s knowledge is scant, and though scant, he relies on what he does not know to comprehend Heaven’s intent.\n\nKnow the Great Oneness, know the Great Yin, know the Great Eye, know the Great Balance, know the Great Square, know the Great Faith, know the Great Constancy—this is perfection.\n\nThe Great Oneness unites them, the Great Yin dissolves them, the Great Eye sees them, the Great Balance harmonizes them, the Great Square embodies them, the Great Faith verifies them, the Great Constancy sustains them.\n\nExhaust Heaven’s fullness, follow illumination, grasp the pivot, begin with that which is other.\n\nThen, in dissolving them, one seems not to dissolve; in knowing them, one seems not to know. It is by not knowing that one comes to know.\n\nIn questioning, there can be no bounds, yet there can be no lack of bounds. Though tangled and slippery, it has substance—past and present do not replace it, nor can it be diminished. Can this not be called the great exaltation and collapse?\n\nWhy not simply question this? Why be so perplexed? Resolving perplexity with non-perplexity, returning to non-perplexity—this is the ultimate non-perplexity.\n\n---\n\n*The Southern Florescence: True Classic, Scroll Four – \"Miscellaneous Chapters: Zeyang, Twenty-Five\"*\n\nZeyang traveled in Chu. Yijie spoke of him to the king, but the king did not summon him. Yijie returned.\n\nPengyang met Wang Guo and said, \"Master, why not recommend me to the king?\"\n\nWang Guo replied, \"I am not as good as Gongyue Xiu.\"\n\nPengyang asked, \"What does Gongyue Xiu do?\"\n\nHe said, \"In winter, he retreats alone to the river; in summer, he rests in the mountain thickets. If someone passes by and asks, he says, 'This is my dwelling.' Yijie could not do this—how much less could I? I am not even Yijie’s equal.\"\n\nAs for Yijie’s character: he had no virtue but possessed knowledge. He did not approve of himself, yet used this to mystify his associations, stumbling blindly into the realm of wealth and honor. He did not assist others with virtue but instead aided their dissipation.\n\nThe frozen borrow clothes from spring; the scorched seek winter’s cool breeze.\n\nThe King of Chu’s character was one of imposing form and severity. In punishing crimes, he was as relentless as a tiger. Without flatterers and upright virtue, who could sway him?\n\nThus, the sage—when impoverished, makes his family forget their poverty; when prosperous, makes kings and lords forget their ranks and emoluments, transforming them to humility.\n\nToward things, he delights in them; toward people, he rejoices in their communion while preserving himself. Thus, sometimes without speaking, he harmonizes others; standing beside them, he transforms them.\n\nThe proper roles of father and son—where do they return to dwell? One inquires into where they are applied. His distance from the hearts of men is thus.\n\nThus, they await Gongyue Xiu.\n\nThe sage’s understanding is thorough and all-encompassing, embracing all as one, yet unaware of how this is so—it is his nature.\n\nResponding to fate and acting with Heaven as his teacher, others then follow and name it. Yet in his concern for knowledge, his actions seldom last long—how can they have an end?\n\nOne born beautiful—people offer him a mirror. If not told, he does not know his beauty surpasses others. Whether he knows or does not know, hears or does not hear, his joy never ceases. People’s fondness for him never ceases—it is his nature.\n\nThe sage’s love for others—people give him a name. If not told, he does not know his love for others. Whether he knows or does not know, hears or does not hear, his love never ceases. People’s comfort in him never ceases—it is his nature.\n\nAn old state, an old capital—gazing upon them brings delight. Even if hills, mounds, grasses, and trees encroach, covering nine-tenths, the delight remains.\n\nDeath is seeing what is seen, hearing what is heard—like a hundred-foot tower suspended to answer the many questions.\n\nRan Xiangshi grasped the center of the ring and followed completion, moving with things without end or beginning, almost without time.\n\nOne who daily transforms with things is the one who does not transform. Once set aside—\n\nThe one who takes Heaven as his teacher yet cannot attain it, who follows things in pursuit—how can his affairs proceed?\n\nThe sage has never begun with Heaven, never begun with man, never begun with a beginning, never begun with things. He moves with the world without ceasing, his actions complete without excess—how does he unite with them?",

When Historian Qi presented the ritual jades, he struck them with his fists and supported the duke with his arms. Such was his extreme arrogance, yet when he beheld a worthy man, such was his reverence—this is why he was called 'Ling.'\"\n\nXi Wei said: \"When Duke Ling died, divination for burial in the ancestral tomb proved inauspicious, but divination at Shaqiu proved auspicious. After digging several *ren* deep, they found a stone outer coffin. Washing it and examining it, they saw an inscription that read: *'Do not rely on his son; Duke Ling shall seize and bury it.'* Duke Ling’s 'Ling' had long been so—how could these two men understand it?\"\n\nLittle Knowledge asked Grand Duke Diao: \"What is meant by 'the speech of the village and the hamlet'?\"\n\nGrand Duke Diao replied: \"The village and hamlet gather ten surnames and a hundred names to form customs. They unite differences into sameness and disperse sameness into differences. Now, if you point to the hundred parts of a horse and do not obtain the horse, yet the horse stands before you—it is by assembling its hundred parts that you call it a horse. Thus, hills and mountains accumulate the lowly to become high; rivers and streams gather waters to become great; the great man unites all to become impartial. Therefore, what enters from without has a master but is not grasped; what issues from within has a norm but is not resisted. The four seasons have distinct *qi*, yet Heaven does not bestow favor, and so the year is completed. The five offices have distinct duties, yet the ruler does not act for private ends, and so the state is well-governed. The civil and martial great men do not bestow favor, and so their virtue is complete. The myriad things have distinct principles, yet the Dao does not act for private ends, and so it has no name. Having no name, it does nothing; doing nothing, yet there is nothing it does not do. The seasons have endings and beginnings; the world has changes and transformations. Fortune and misfortune flow like a current—where there is resistance, there is also what is fitting. Those who sacrifice themselves do so in different ways—where there is rectitude, there is also error. Compared to a great marsh, all goods pass through; observed in a great mountain, trees and stones share the same ground. This is what is meant by 'the speech of the village and the hamlet.'\"\n\nLittle Knowledge said: \"Then can this be called the Dao?\"\n\nGrand Duke Diao said: \"No. Now, the number of things is not limited to ten thousand, yet we call them 'the ten thousand things' because we use the term for the greatest number to name them. Thus, Heaven and Earth are the greatest of forms; *yin* and *yang* are the greatest of *qi*; the Dao is their impartiality. To name and call them by their greatness is permissible, but once they exist, how can they be compared? If you debate in this way, it is like comparing dogs and horses—how far they fall short!\n\nLittle Knowledge said: \"Within the four directions, within the six conjunctions, from whence do the ten thousand things arise?\"\n\nGrand Duke Diao said: \"*Yin* and *yang* illuminate and cover each other, govern and regulate each other. The four seasons succeed one another, giving birth and bringing death. Desires and aversions, departures and approaches arise in this way; male and female unite in this manner. Safety and danger alternate; fortune and misfortune beget each other. Urgency and slowness rub against each other; gathering and scattering complete things. These are the facts that can be recorded, the essences that can be noted. Following the sequence of their principles, the movements of their bridges and mechanisms, when exhausted they return, when ended they begin—this is what things possess. What words can exhaust, what knowledge can reach, is merely the limit of things.

Even one of great knowledge cannot use words to describe how they transform themselves, nor can they anticipate what they will do. Analyzing this, the essence reaches the unparalleled, the greatness reaches the unbounded. Whether something makes or nothing does, they cannot escape things and thus ultimately consider it a fault. Something making is substantial; nothing doing is empty. Having name and reality is where things reside; having no name and no reality is the emptiness of things. What can be spoken and conceived—speaking of it only makes it more distant. What has not yet been born cannot be hindered; what has already died cannot be obstructed. Life and death are not far apart—principle cannot be seen. Whether something makes or nothing does, doubt borrows from this. Observing its root, its going is endless; seeking its end, its coming is unceasing. Endless and unceasing, words have nothing to say—it shares the principle of things. Whether something makes or nothing does, words are its root, sharing the beginning and end of things. The Dao cannot be possessed; what is possessed cannot be without it. The name 'Dao' is what is borrowed to act. Whether something makes or nothing does, it is but one corner of things—how does it compare to the great square? If words suffice, then speaking all day long exhausts the Dao; if words do not suffice, then speaking all day long exhausts things. The ultimate of the Dao and things—speech and silence cannot bear it.

All men desire their ministers to be loyal, yet loyalty does not necessarily earn trust; thus Wu Yun was cast into the river, and Chang Hong died in Shu, his blood stored for three years before turning to jade. All parents desire their children to be filial, yet filial piety does not necessarily bring love; thus Xiaoji grieved, and Zeng Shen mourned.\n\nWhen wood rubs against wood, it ignites; when metal is held to fire, it melts. When yin and yang clash, heaven and earth convulse—thus there is thunder and lightning, fire within water, and the great locust tree burns. When one is beset by double sorrows with no escape, the falling mantis fails to mature, and the heart hangs suspended between heaven and earth, comfort and gloom entangled. As benefit and harm grind against each other, fire blazes fiercely. The multitude burns harmony away; the moon, though constant, cannot withstand the flames. Thus, there is a sudden collapse, and the Dao is exhausted.\n\nZhuangzi was poor, so he went to borrow grain from the Marquis of the River. The Marquis said, \"Very well. When I receive the taxes from my fief, I will lend you three hundred gold pieces—will that suffice?\" Zhuang Zhou flushed with anger and replied, \"On my way here yesterday, I heard a cry from the road. I turned to look and saw a bream in the rut of a chariot wheel. I asked, 'Bream, what are you doing here?' It answered, 'I am a wave-minister of the Eastern Sea. Might you have a dipper of water to keep me alive?' I said, 'Very well. I am about to travel south to persuade the kings of Wu and Yue, and I will divert the waters of the West River to bring you there—will that suffice?' The bream flushed with anger and replied, 'I have lost my accustomed element and have nowhere to go. A dipper of water would keep me alive for now, yet you speak thus—you might as well seek me in a dried-fish shop!'\"\n\nLord Ren made a great hook with a massive black rope, baited it with fifty steers, crouched on Mount Kuaiji, cast his line into the Eastern Sea, and fished day after day for a year without catching anything. Then a great fish took the bait, dragged the hook down, plunged violently, and thrashed its fins, raising white waves like mountains. The sea churned, the sound terrifying spirits for a thousand *li*. Lord Ren caught the fish, butchered it, and salted it. From Zhihe eastward to north of Cangwu, none did not feast on it. Thereafter, those of later generations—petty talents, wandering persuaders—all marveled and spread the tale. Yet those who raise flimsy poles, rush to irrigation ditches, and cling to shallow theories—how could they ever catch a great fish? Those who adorn trivial words to seek high office are as far from great understanding as the sky from the earth. Thus, they have never heard of the customs of the Ren clan, and their inability to navigate the world is equally distant.\n\nConfucians use the *Odes* and *Rites* to rob graves. A great Confucian recited the liturgy: \"Dawn breaks in the east—how goes the affair?\" A lesser Confucian replied, \"The skirt and trousers are not yet untied, but there is a pearl in the mouth.\" The *Odes* indeed say: \"The green, green wheat grows on the hillside. If one does not give in life, why hold onto a pearl in death?\" They seized his temples, rubbed his skull, and with a metal mallet pried open his jaw, carefully parting his cheeks to avoid damaging the pearl in his mouth.\n\nA disciple of Lao Laizi went to gather firewood and encountered Confucius. He returned and reported, \"There is a man over there—his upper body is long, his lower body short, his back hunched, his ears set far back. His gaze seems to survey the four seas—who is he?\" Lao Laizi said, \"That is Qiu.\" He summoned Confucius, who arrived. Lao Laizi said, \"Qiu, cast aside your bodily pride and your cultivated knowledge—then you may become a gentleman.\" Confucius bowed and withdrew, his expression troubled, and asked, \"May I advance in my work?\" Lao Laizi replied, \"One who cannot bear the wounds of a single generation but startles at the calamities of ten thousand ages—is this not stubborn and narrow? Or is it that your plans fall short? To take joy in alarm is a lifelong disgrace. The conduct of the common people advances thus: they draw one another by fame, bind one another by secrecy. Rather than praise Yao and condemn Jie, it is better to forget both and close off what you praise. To turn back is to invite harm; to act is to invite error. The sage hesitates in affairs, achieving success by chance—why should you burden yourself with such pride to the end?\"\n\nDuke Yuan of Song dreamed in the dead of night of a man with disheveled hair peering through the side gate, who said, \"I come from the Zailu Abyss.

The duke asked, \"What did you catch in your fishing?\" Yu Ju answered, \"I caught a white turtle in my net, five feet in circumference.\" The duke said, \"Present this turtle to me.\" When the turtle arrived, the duke wavered twice—first wanting to kill it, then wanting to spare it. His mind unsettled, he divined with it, saying, \"Killing the turtle for divination will bring good fortune.\" So they split the turtle open, drilling seventy-two times without a single miscast.\n\nConfucius said: \"The sacred turtle could appear in a dream to Duke Yuan, yet could not escape Yu Ju’s net; it could know enough to yield seventy-two flawless divinations, yet could not avoid the calamity of having its entrails cut out. Thus, even knowledge has its limitations, and even the numinous has its shortcomings. Though one possesses the highest wisdom, ten thousand men may still outscheme it. Fish do not fear the net but fear the roc. Discard petty knowledge, and great knowledge becomes clear; abandon contrived goodness, and true goodness arises of itself. A newborn babe, without a teacher of stone, can speak—because it dwells among those who can speak.\"\n\nHuizi said to Zhuangzi, \"Your words are useless.\" Zhuangzi replied, \"Only when one knows the useless can one begin to speak of the useful. Heaven and earth are neither narrow nor small, yet what man uses is no more than the space his feet occupy. If, then, one were to dig away all the earth around his feet down to the Yellow Springs, would there still be any use for it?\" Huizi said, \"There would be none.\" Zhuangzi said, \"Then the usefulness of the useless is also clear.\"\n\nZhuangzi said: \"If a man has the ability to wander, can he choose not to wander? If a man cannot wander, can he force himself to do so? Those with drifting, evasive ambitions and reckless, self-destructive conduct—alas, are they fit for the tasks of perfect wisdom and profound virtue? They topple and do not recover, rush headlong and do not look back. Though they may be bound as ruler and minister, it is but a matter of time; when the age changes, they will no longer hold each other in contempt. Thus, the Perfect Man does not linger in his conduct. Those who exalt the past and belittle the present belong to the current of scholars. Yet if one views the present age through the lens of the Xiawei clan, who could avoid being swept along? Only the Perfect Man can wander through the world without bias, follow others without losing himself. He does not learn from teachings, but grasps their intent without clinging to them. Eyes that penetrate are called bright; ears that penetrate are called keen; a nose that penetrates is called discerning; a mouth that penetrates is called savoring; a mind that penetrates is called wise; wisdom that penetrates is called virtue. The Dao does not thrive on obstruction; obstruction leads to choking, and if choking persists, it turns to ruin, from which a multitude of harms arise. All creatures with knowledge depend on breath; if it does not flow smoothly, it is not Heaven’s fault. Heaven bores through them day and night without cease, yet man turns and blocks his own treasure. The womb has its layered gates, the mind has its celestial wanderings. If a room has no empty space, mother and daughter-in-law will quarrel; if the mind has no celestial wandering, the six senses will jostle one another. The great forests and mountains are good for man, yet even the spiritually endowed cannot fully master them. Does virtue overflow into fame, and fame into violence? Do schemes depend on knowledge, and knowledge arise from contention? Does obstruction grow from rigidity, and official affairs culminate in the harmony of the many? When spring rains fall in season, grasses and trees flourish, and the plow begins its work. Half the plants that sprout do so without man knowing why. Stillness can heal illness, slander can rest the aged, and tranquility can halt haste. Yet even so, these are the concerns of the toiling, not the leisurely who have never troubled themselves to inquire. What startles the common people is what the sage takes as his time and realm; what startles the sage is what the spirit man has never troubled to inquire about. What startles the worthy is what the sage has never troubled to inquire about; what startles the gentleman is what the worthy has never troubled to inquire about; what unites the petty man is what the gentleman has never troubled to inquire about.\n\nWhen Yanmen’s father died, he mourned so perfectly that he was appointed an official teacher. His fellow villagers, emulating his grief, died from excessive mourning. Yao offered the world to Xu You, but Xu You fled from it; Tang offered it to Wu Guang, and Wu Guang grew angry. When Ji Ta heard of this, he led his disciples to kneel by the waters of the Ji River. The feudal lords came to console him, and after three years, Shentu Di drowned himself in the river.\n\nThe fish trap exists for the sake of the fish; once the fish is caught, the trap is forgotten. The rabbit snare exists for the sake of the rabbit; once the rabbit is caught, the snare is forgotten. Words exist for the sake of meaning; once the meaning is grasped, the words are forgotten.

How is it so? It is so because it is so. How is it not so? It is not so because it is not so. How is it acceptable? It is acceptable because it is acceptable. How is it unacceptable? It is unacceptable because it is unacceptable. Things inherently have what they affirm, things inherently have what they accept; nothing is not affirmed, nothing is not accepted.\n\nIf not for goblet words emerging daily, harmonizing with the Heavenly Equality, who could endure for long? All things are seeds, succeeding one another in different forms, beginning and end like a ring, with no discernible order—this is called the Heavenly Equilibrium. The Heavenly Equilibrium is the Heavenly Equality.\n\nZhuangzi said to Huizi: \"Confucius lived sixty years and underwent sixty transformations. What he initially affirmed, he later rejected—who knows whether what he now calls right is not what he deemed wrong at fifty-nine?\" Huizi said: \"Confucius diligently applied his will and served his knowledge.\" Zhuangzi said: \"Confucius has renounced such things, yet he has never spoken of it. Confucius said: 'One receives one’s endowment from the great root and revives one’s spirit to live. Singing in accord with the pitch, speaking in accord with the law. Profit and righteousness are set before one, yet likes and dislikes, right and wrong merely submit to people’s mouths. To make people submit with their hearts and not dare to stand in opposition, to settle the world’s settlements—enough, enough! I shall never reach his level.'\"\n\nZengzi took office twice, and his heart transformed twice. He said: \"When I served while my parents were alive, three *fu* of grain brought me joy; later, when I served, three thousand *zhong* did not suffice, and my heart grieved.\" A disciple asked Confucius: \"Can Zeng Shen be said to have no attachment to blame?\" Confucius said: \"He was already attached. How could one without attachment feel sorrow? To him, three *fu* and three thousand *zhong* were like watching sparrows and mosquitoes pass before him.\"\n\nYan Chengzi You said to Shu Guozijing: \"Since I heard your words, after one year I became rustic, after two years I followed, after three years I penetrated, after four years I became one with things, after five years things came to me, after six years spirits entered, after seven years Heaven was accomplished, after eight years I knew neither death nor life, and after nine years I attained the great mystery. Life is action; death is rest—exhort yourself. Because death has a source, while life, being yang, has no source. Is it truly so? Where does it go? Where does it not go? Heaven has its celestial reckoning, earth has its human foundations—where should I seek it? No one knows its end—how can there be no fate? No one knows its beginning—how can there be fate? When there is a response, how can there be no spirits? When there is no response, how can there be spirits?\"\n\nThe multitude of *wangliang* asked the shadow: \"Earlier you were bowing, now you are raising your head; earlier your hair was tied up, now it is loose; earlier you were sitting, now you are standing; earlier you were walking, now you are still—why?\" The shadow said: \"Such trifling questions! Why ask? I act without knowing why. I am like the cicada’s shell, the snake’s slough—seemingly so, yet not so. Fire and sun, I gather with them; yin and night, I alternate with them. Do I depend on them? How much more so for those who depend on others! When they come, I come with them; when they go, I go with them; when they are strong and yang, I am strong and yang with them. What question is there in strong yang?\"\n\nYang Ziju was traveling south to Pei when Lao Dan was journeying west to Qin. They met at the outskirts of Liang, where Laozi sighed to the sky mid-journey and said: \"At first I thought you could be taught, but now you cannot.\" Yang Ziju did not respond. Upon reaching their lodging, he brought water for washing, a towel, and comb, removed his shoes outside the door, advanced on his knees, and said: \"Earlier, your disciple wished to ask you, Master, but you were traveling without speaking, so I did not dare. Now you have spoken—please tell me my fault.\" Laozi said: \"Your haughty and overbearing demeanor—who would wish to dwell with you? The purest white appears sullied; the greatest virtue seems insufficient.\" Yang Ziju’s expression changed abruptly, and he said: \"I respectfully receive your instruction.\" When he first arrived, the innkeeper welcomed him, the master of the house laid out the mat, his wife brought the towel and comb, the guests moved from their seats, and those warming themselves stepped away from the hearth. When he returned, the innkeeper vied with him for his seat.\n\n*The Southern Florescence Perfected Scripture, Scroll Five: Miscellaneous Chapters, \"Yielding the Throne\" Twenty-Eight*\n\nYao offered the empire to Xu You, who refused it. He then offered it to Zizhou Zhipo, who said: \"To make me Son of Heaven would be acceptable. However, I happen to suffer from a deep melancholy, and I am just now treating it—I have no leisure to govern the empire. The empire is the weightiest of things, yet I would not let it harm my life—how much less other things!

      "translated_text": "Zizhou Zhibo said: \"I happen to suffer from a deep melancholy, and I am just now treating it—I have no leisure to govern the empire. Thus the empire is the greatest of vessels, yet one does not exchange life for it. This is how those who embody the Dao differ from the common world.\"\n\nShun offered the empire to Shan Juan. Shan Juan said: \"I stand amidst the cosmos—winter I clothe myself in furs, summer in hempen cloth. In spring I plow and sow, my body sufficient for labor; in autumn I reap and gather, my person sufficient for rest and sustenance. I rise with the sun and work, set with the sun and rest, wandering carefree between heaven and earth, my heart and will content. Why should I desire the empire?\" He sighed, \"Alas, you do not know me.\" And so he refused it. Thereupon he departed and entered the depths of Mount Tan, and none knew his whereabouts.\n\nShun offered the empire to his friend, the farmer of Shihu. The farmer of Shihu said: \"How earnest is the lord’s conduct—a man who preserves his strength! Yet I deem Shun’s virtue still insufficient.\" Thereupon he and his wife, carrying their child on their backs, fled to the sea and never returned.\n\nKing Tai of Zhi dwelled in Deng. The Di tribes attacked him. He offered them furs and silks, but they refused; he offered them dogs and horses, but they refused; he offered them pearls and jade, but they refused. What the Di sought was land. King Tai of Zhi said: \"To dwell with a man’s elder brother and kill his younger brother, to dwell with a man’s father and kill his son—I cannot bear it. Go, all of you, and dwell as you will. Whether one serves as my subject or as a subject of the Di—what difference is there? Moreover, I have heard that one does not harm what nourishes life for the sake of what is used to nourish it.\" Thereupon he took up his staff and departed. The people followed him in droves, and he established a state beneath Mount Qi.\n\nKing Tai of Zhi may be said to have known how to honor life. Those who honor life, though noble and wealthy, do not let what nourishes harm their person; though poor and lowly, they do not let profit burden their form. Yet today’s men who occupy high office and exalted rank all fear losing them. Seeing profit, they lightly risk their lives—how deluded they are!\n\nThe people of Yue assassinated their ruler for three generations. Prince Sou, troubled by this, fled into the cinnabar caves. When Yue was left without a ruler, the people sought Prince Sou but could not find him. They followed him to the cinnabar caves. Prince Sou refused to emerge, so the people smoked him out with mugwort. They bore him away in a jade carriage. Prince Sou grasped the carriage strap and mounted, gazing heavenward and crying: \"Rulership! Rulership! Could you not spare me alone?\" Prince Sou did not hate being a ruler—he hated the calamity of being a ruler. Such a man as Prince Sou may be said not to have harmed his life for the sake of the state. This was precisely what the people of Yue desired in a ruler.\n\nHan and Wei contended over encroached land. Master Hua Zi visited Marquis Zhao of Xi, who wore a troubled expression. Master Hua Zi said: \"Suppose now that the world inscribed a pledge before you, its words saying: 'Grasp it with your left hand, and your right hand will be severed; grasp it with your right hand, and your left hand will be severed. Yet whoever grasps it shall possess the world.' Would you grasp it?\" Marquis Zhao of Xi said: \"I would not grasp it.\" Master Hua Zi said: \"Excellent. From this we see that one’s two arms are weightier than the world, and one’s body is weightier than one’s two arms. The state of Han is far lighter than the world, and what you now contend over is far lighter than Han. Yet you grieve and harm your life, fretting over what you cannot obtain.\" The marquis said: \"Well said! Many have instructed me, but never have I heard such words.\" Master Hua Zi may be said to have known the measure of light and heavy.\n\nThe Lord of Lu heard that Yan He was a man who had attained the Dao. He sent an envoy bearing gifts to precede him. Yan He dwelled in a humble lane, wearing coarse cloth and feeding his own oxen. When the Lord of Lu’s envoy arrived, Yan He personally received him. The envoy asked: \"Is this the home of Yan He?\" Yan He replied: \"This is He’s home.\" The envoy presented the gifts. Yan He said: \"I fear the messenger may have misheard and would incur blame. It would be better to verify.\" The envoy returned, confirmed the matter, and came again to seek him, but Yan He could not be found. Thus one such as Yan He truly despised wealth and honor.\n\nTherefore it is said: The true essence of the Dao is for governing the self; its remnants may be used for ordering the state; its dregs may be used for governing the world. From this we see that the achievements of emperors and kings are but the leftover tasks of sages—never what perfects the person or nourishes life. Yet today’s worldly gentlemen often endanger their bodies and abandon their lives to pursue things—is this not lamentable?\n\nWhenever sages act, they must examine their purpose and their means. Suppose now there were a man here who used a pearl fit for the Duke of Sui to shoot a sparrow a thousand fathoms high—surely the world would laugh at him. Why? Because what he used was weighty, and what he sought was light. Yet life—how is it not weightier than the pearl of the Duke of Sui?\n\nMaster Liezi was poor, his countenance bearing the hue of hunger. A guest mentioned this to Zi Yang of Zheng, saying: \"Lie Yukou is a man of the Dao. That he dwells in your state yet suffers poverty—does this not suggest you do not esteem scholars?\" Zi Yang of Zheng immediately ordered his officials to send him grain. Master Liezi met the envoy, bowed twice, and declined. The envoy departed. Master Liezi entered his home, where his wife gazed at him and beat her breast, saying: \"I have heard that the wife and children of a man of the Dao all enjoy ease and happiness. Now we bear the hue of hunger. The lord deigned to send you food, yet you refused it—is this not fate?\" Master Liezi laughed and said to her: \"The lord does not know me himself. He sent me grain on another’s word, and when he punishes me, it will likewise be on another’s word. This is why I did not accept it.\" In the end, the people indeed rose in rebellion and killed Zi Yang.\n\nKing Zhao of Chu lost his state. The butcher Yue followed in flight after King Zhao.",

My wisdom was insufficient to preserve the state, and my courage insufficient to die in battle against the enemy. When the Wu army entered Ying, I fled from peril and avoided the foe—not that I deliberately followed Your Majesty. Now, if Your Majesty wishes to set aside the law and break the covenant to grant me an audience, this is not what I have heard of under heaven.\"\n\nThe king said to Marshal Zi Jing: \"The butcher Yue dwells in lowly and humble circumstances, yet his exposition of principle is most lofty. You must extend to him the rank of the Three Standards.\"\n\nThe butcher Yue said: \"The rank of the Three Standards—I know it is nobler than my butcher’s stall; the emolument of ten thousand *zhong*—I know it is richer than my butcher’s profit. Yet how could I covet rank and emolument and thereby cause my lord to bear the name of reckless bestowal? I dare not accept. I wish only to return to my butcher’s stall.\" Thus he refused.\n\nYuan Xian dwelt in Lu, in a wattle hut with walls no more than a fathom square, thatched with living grass.

Rain leaked through above, and damp seeped below, yet he sat upright and plucked his zither.\n\nZi Gong arrived in a grand carriage, clad in a purple robe with a white sash, his high-wheeled chariot too wide for the lane. He went to see Yuan Xian.\n\nYuan Xian, wearing a hat of rushes and slippers of untanned leather, leaned on a staff of thornwood to answer the door.\n\nZi Gong said: \"Alas! Master, what ails you?\"\n\nYuan Xian replied: \"I have heard that to lack wealth is called poverty; to study yet be unable to practice is called affliction. Now I am poor, not afflicted.\"\n\nZi Gong retreated, his face flushed with shame.\n\nYuan Xian laughed and said: \"To act for the sake of worldly approval, to befriend for the sake of cliques, to study for others, to teach for oneself, to conceal one’s virtue beneath benevolence and righteousness, to adorn oneself with carriages and horses—these are things I cannot bear to do.\"\n\nZengzi dwelt in Wei, wrapped in a quilted robe without lining, his complexion swollen and sallow, his hands and feet calloused and cracked. For three days he had not kindled a fire, for ten years he had not made new clothes. When he straightened his cap, its strings snapped; when he grasped his lapels, his elbows showed; when he pulled on his shoes, his heels split. Yet he dragged his hem and sang the *Odes of Shang*, his voice filling heaven and earth, resonant as metal and stone.\n\nNo Son of Heaven could make him a subject, no feudal lord could make him a friend. Thus, he who nurtures his will forgets his form; he who nurtures his form forgets profit; he who attains the Dao forgets his mind.\n\nConfucius said to Yan Hui: \"Come, Hui. Your family is poor and your station low—why do you not enter official service?\"\n\nYan Hui replied: \"I do not wish to serve. I have fifty *mu* of fields outside the outer wall, enough to provide millet gruel; ten *mu* within the wall, enough to supply silk and hemp. Playing the zither is enough for my amusement; studying the Master’s Dao is enough for my joy. I do not wish to serve.\"\n\nConfucius’s expression changed, and he said: \"Excellent, Hui’s intent! I have heard that he who knows contentment is not burdened by profit; he who is truly self-possessed does not fear loss; he whose conduct is cultivated within does not chafe at lack of position. I have recited this for a long time, but only now, in you, Hui, do I see it. This is my gain.\"\n\nPrince Mou of Zhongshan said to Zhanzi: \"My body dwells by rivers and seas, yet my heart resides beneath the palace gates of Wei—what is to be done?\"\n\nZhanzi said: \"Value life. If you value life, profit will seem light.\"\n\nPrince Mou of Zhongshan said: \"Though I know this, I cannot overcome myself.\"\n\nZhanzi said: \"If you cannot overcome yourself, then follow your inclination—what harm is there to the spirit? But if you cannot overcome yourself and yet force yourself not to follow, this is called double injury. A doubly injured man belongs not to the long-lived.\"\n\nPrince Mou of Wei, a prince of ten thousand chariots, found it harder to retire to caves and wilds than a commoner. Though he had not yet attained the Dao, he could be said to have grasped its intent.\n\nConfucius was beset between Chen and Cai, going seven days without cooked food, eating only a thin vegetable broth without grain.

Yan Hui drove the carriage, and Zigong stood at his right as they went to meet Robber Zhi.

      "translated_text": "Kong Qiu again sent word, saying, \"I have found favor with the Ji family. I wish only to gaze upon your tent-flap.\" The attendant relayed this, and Robber Zhi said, \"Let him come forward.\" Kong Qiu hastened in, stepped back from his mat, and bowed twice to Robber Zhi.\n\nRobber Zhi flew into a rage, stretched out his legs, pressed his sword, glared with blazing eyes, and roared like a nursing tiger: \"Qiu, come forward! If your words please me, you shall live; if they run counter to my heart, you shall die.\"\n\nKong Qiu said, \"I have heard that in all the world there are three virtues: to be born and grow tall, surpassingly fair and peerless, so that young and old, noble and base, all who see you rejoice—this is the highest virtue. To comprehend the bounds of Heaven and Earth, to distinguish all things—this is the middle virtue. To be fierce, resolute, and bold, to gather multitudes and lead armies—this is the lowest virtue. Whoever possesses but one of these virtues is fit to face south and style himself a lord. Now, General, you combine all three: your body stands eight feet and two inches, your face and eyes radiant, your lips like stirred cinnabar, your teeth like aligned cowries, your voice attuned to the Yellow Bell. Yet you are called Robber Zhi—I privately feel shame for you that you do not claim what is yours. If you would heed me, I shall go south to Wu and Yue, north to Qi and Lu, east to Song and Wei, west to Jin and Chu, and have built for you a great city of several hundred *li*, with a town of several hundred thousand households. I shall exalt you as a feudal lord, make a fresh start with the world, disband your troops, rest your soldiers, gather and nurture your brothers, and together offer sacrifice to your ancestors. This is the conduct of a sage and a man of talent, and the world’s deepest wish.\"\n\nRobber Zhi flew into a rage: \"Qiu, come forward! Those who can be swayed by profit or admonished by words are but the dull and vulgar common folk. Now, to be tall and fair, so that all who see you rejoice—this is the legacy of my father and mother. Though you do not praise me, do I not know it myself? Moreover, I have heard that those who flatter others to their faces also slander them behind their backs. Now you tell me of great cities and teeming multitudes—this is to lure me with profit and treat me like a beast to be penned. How could such things last? Of all great cities, none is greater than the world itself. Yao and Shun possessed the world, yet their descendants had not a pin’s place to stand. Tang and Wu became Son of Heaven, yet their posterity perished utterly. Was this not because their profit was too great?\n\nFurthermore, I have heard that in ancient times beasts were many and people few. Thus, people all dwelt in nests to avoid them, gathering acorns by day and roosting in trees by night—hence they were called the people of the Nest Builder. In ancient times, people knew not clothing; in summer they piled firewood, in winter they warmed themselves by it—hence they were called the people who knew how to live. In the age of Shen Nong, people lived at ease, rising and moving about freely. They knew their mothers but not their fathers, dwelt with elk and deer, plowed to eat, wove to clothe themselves, and harbored no thought of harming one another. This was the height of perfect virtue. Yet the Yellow Emperor could not sustain this virtue: he fought Chi You on the plains of Zhuolu, and blood flowed for a hundred *li*. Yao and Shun arose and established a host of ministers; Tang exiled his lord, King Wu slew Zhou. From that time onward, the strong oppressed the weak, the many bullied the few. From Tang and Wu to the present, all have been men of disorder.\n\nNow you cultivate the Way of Wen and Wu, grasp the world’s eloquence, and teach posterity. You wear fine robes with narrow sashes, speak in affected tones, and act with false conduct to delude the world’s rulers, seeking thereby wealth and honor. There is no greater thief than you. Why does the world not call you Thief Qiu, instead of calling me Robber Zhi? You beguiled Zilu with sweet words to make him follow you, had him remove his martial cap and lay aside his long sword to receive your teachings. The world all says that Kong Qiu can quell violence and forbid wrongdoing. Yet in the end, Zilu sought to kill the lord of Wei and failed, and his body was impaled above the eastern gate of Wei. This was because your teaching was insufficient. Do you call yourself a man of talent and a sage? Then why were you twice driven from Lu, your traces erased in Wei, impoverished in Qi, besieged in Chen and Cai, and left with no place in the world? You taught Zilu to meet this disaster, leaving him neither honor above nor humanity below. Is your Way truly worthy of esteem?\n\nOf all those the world exalts, none is greater than the Yellow Emperor, yet even he could not preserve his virtue intact. He fought on the plains of Zhuolu, and blood flowed for a hundred *li*. Yao was unkind, Shun was unfilial, Yu was crippled on one side, Tang exiled his lord, King Wu attacked Zhou, King Wen was imprisoned at Youli. These six men are those the world exalts, yet when one examines them, all were deluded by profit and forced their true natures to rebel against their inborn dispositions. Their conduct was most shameful indeed.\n\nOf those the world calls worthy men, none surpass Boyi and Shuqi. Boyi and Shuqi renounced the lordship of Guzhu and starved to death on Mount Shouyang, their flesh and bones left unburied. Bao Jiao adorned his conduct to condemn the age and embraced a tree to die. Shentu Di remonstrated but was not heeded, carried a stone and cast himself into the river, where he was eaten by fish and turtles. Jie Zitui was most loyal: he cut flesh from his own thigh to feed Duke Wen. Later, Duke Wen betrayed him, and in anger he departed, embraced a tree, and burned to death. Weisheng made a tryst with a woman beneath a bridge. When she did not come and the waters rose, he would not leave, embraced the bridge pillar, and drowned. These six men were no different from stray dogs, drifting swine, or beggars clutching gourds. All pursued fame and scorned death, heedless of their roots, nurturing life, and preserving their inborn nature.\n\nOf those the world calls loyal ministers, none surpass Prince Bigan and Wu Zixu. Zixu was drowned in the river, Bigan was disemboweled—these two are called loyal ministers, yet in the end they were laughed at by the world. From the highest perspective, down to Zixu and Bigan, none are worthy of esteem.\"",

      "translated_text": "Confucius said to me: \"If you speak to me of ghostly matters, I cannot know them; but if you speak to me of human affairs, they do not exceed these—all are things I have heard and understood. Now I shall tell you of human nature: the eyes desire to see beauty, the ears to hear sound, the mouth to savor flavors, and the will and qi seek fulfillment. A man may live a long life of a hundred years, a middling life of eighty, or a short life of sixty; yet if we subtract days lost to illness, emaciation, mourning, death, and sorrow, the days in which he opens his mouth to laugh number no more than four or five in a month. Heaven and earth are without end, but man’s death comes at a fixed time. To grasp a vessel of fixed duration and entrust it to the boundless void is to pass like a swift steed galloping past a crack in the wall—suddenly, in an instant. Those who cannot delight their will and nurture their lifespan are not masters of the Dao.\n\nAll that I have said, you must cast aside. Hurry, leave, and return home—do not speak of it again. Your Way is wild and erratic, full of deceit, cunning, and falsity—it cannot preserve the true. What is there to discuss?\"\n\nConfucius bowed twice, then hastened away. He exited the gate, mounted his carriage, and three times lost hold of the reins. His eyes were dazed and sightless, his complexion ashen like the dead. He leaned against the crossbar, head bowed, unable to catch his breath. Upon returning to the eastern gate of Lu, he chanced upon Liuxia Ji.\n\nLiuxia Ji said: \"I have not seen you for several days, and your carriage and horses bear signs of travel. Might you have gone to see Jue?\"\n\nConfucius looked up to the heavens and sighed: \"Indeed.\"\n\nLiuxia Ji said: \"Did he perhaps go against your intentions as before?\"\n\nConfucius said: \"Indeed. I was like a man without illness who moxibusts himself—running swiftly to measure a tiger’s head or braid its whiskers, nearly escaping not from the tiger’s jaws!\"\n\nZizhang asked Mang Goude: \"Why do you not act?\"\n\n\"Without action, there is no trust; without trust, no responsibility; without responsibility, no benefit. Thus, when one observes reputation and calculates profit, righteousness is truly at stake. If one abandons fame and gain and turns inward to the heart, then the scholar’s conduct cannot be neglected for even a day.\"\n\nMang Goude said: \"The shameless grow rich, and the deceitful gain prominence. The greatest of fame and profit lie in shamelessness and deceit. Thus, when one observes reputation and calculates profit, trust is truly at stake. If one abandons fame and gain and turns inward to the heart, then the scholar’s conduct embraces the celestial.\"\n\nZizhang said: \"In ancient times, Jie and Zhou were honored as Sons of Heaven and possessed all under heaven. Yet if today you tell a man of Zang or Ju, 'Your conduct is like Jie or Zhou,' he will flush with anger and feel indignant—such is the contempt of petty men. Confucius and Mo Di were impoverished commoners, yet if today you tell a minister, 'Your conduct is like Confucius or Mo Di,' he will change his expression and protest his inadequacy—such is the true esteem of the scholar. Thus, to be a Son of Heaven does not necessarily confer nobility, nor does poverty as a commoner necessarily confer baseness. The distinction between noble and base lies in the beauty or ugliness of one’s conduct.\"\n\nMang Goude said: \"Petty thieves are imprisoned, but great thieves become lords; and at the gates of lords, righteous scholars take refuge. In the past, Duke Huan of Qi, Xiaobai, killed his brother and took his sister-in-law, yet Guan Zhong served as his minister. Tian Chengzi murdered his lord and usurped the state, yet Confucius accepted his gifts. In speech, they are condemned; in action, they are deferred to—is this not a contradiction in the heart, a perversion? Thus, the Book says: 'Who is base? Who is noble? The successful are heads, the unsuccessful are tails.'\n\nZizhang said: \"If you do not act, then kinship and affection will lack order, noble and base will lack righteousness, and elder and younger will lack sequence. How then can the Five Constants and Six Positions be distinguished?\"\n\nMang Goude said: \"Yao killed his eldest son, Shun exiled his younger brother—where is the order in kinship? Tang exiled Jie, King Wu killed Zhou—where is the righteousness in noble and base? King Ji was the rightful heir, yet the Duke of Zhou killed his brother—where is the sequence in elder and younger? The Confucians speak falsely, the Mohists preach universal love—how can the Five Constants and Six Positions be distinguished?\n\nMoreover, you rectify for fame, I rectify for profit. The reality of fame and profit does not accord with principle, nor does it reflect the Dao. Daily I debate with you before Wu Yue, saying: 'The petty man dies for wealth, the gentleman dies for fame.' Though their emotions and natures differ in what they change and alter, when it comes to abandoning what they do for what they do not do, they are the same. Thus it is said: Do not be a petty man, turn back and die for the celestial. Do not be a gentleman, follow the principle of Heaven. Whether crooked or straight, align with the celestial pole; face the four directions and ebb and flow with the times. Whether right or wrong, grasp the round mechanism, stand alone in intent, and wander with the Dao. Do not act for gain, do not establish righteousness, lest you lose what you seek. Do not rush toward wealth, do not die for success, lest you abandon the celestial.\n\nBigan was disemboweled, Wu Zixu had his eyes gouged out—such are the calamities of loyalty. Zhigong testified against his father, Weisheng drowned—such are the perils of trust. Master Bao stood firm, Shenzi did not defend himself—such are the harms of integrity. Confucius did not see his mother, Kuangzi did not see his father—such are the failures of righteousness. These are the traditions of the upper ages and the talk of later generations. For scholars who rectify their words and verify their conduct, they bring upon themselves disaster and calamity.\"\n\nWuzu asked Zhihe: \"There has never been a man who did not pursue fame and profit. The wealthy attract followers; followers defer to them; deference brings esteem. To be deferred to and esteemed is the way to long life, bodily ease, and joyful contentment. Why do you alone have no such intention? Is your knowledge insufficient? Or do you know but lack the strength to act? Or do you cling to some other principle?\"\n\nZhihe said: \"Now, those who consider themselves contemporaries and neighbors regard those who transcend custom and surpass the world as...\"",

Zixu was drowned in the river, Bigan was disemboweled—these two are called loyal ministers, yet in the end they were laughed at by the world.

      "translated_text": "This is to be without a guiding principle, by which one surveys the ages of past and present and distinguishes right from wrong, yet still drifts with the world’s transformations. They cast aside what is most weighty and abandon what is most honorable, all for the sake of their own pursuits. How far this is from the Way of long life, bodily ease, and joyful contentment! The pain of sorrowful illness and the peace of serene delight are not reflected in the body; the fear of constant dread and the joy of heartfelt delight are not reflected in the mind. They know how to act but not why they act—thus, though they are honored as Son of Heaven and possess all under Heaven, they cannot escape calamity.\"\n\nWuzu said: \"Wealth brings every advantage to man. It exhausts beauty and exhausts power, reaching what even the most perfect cannot attain and what the worthiest cannot match. It harnesses the strength and courage of the bold to create might, wields the wisdom and schemes of others to achieve clarity, and adopts the virtue of others to appear worthy and good. Without even holding office, one commands reverence like a sovereign or father. Moreover, the pleasures of sound, color, flavor, and power—these delight the heart without need of learning, and the body finds comfort in them without need of imitation. Desires and aversions, what to seek and what to avoid, are innate and require no teacher: this is the nature of man. Though all under Heaven may condemn them, who can refuse them?\"\n\nZhihe said: \"The actions of the wise are thus: they move in accord with the people, never transgressing proper measure. Therefore, they are content and do not contend, and for no purpose do they seek. Those who lack seek, and though they contend in all directions, they do not consider themselves greedy. Those who have surplus decline, casting aside all under Heaven without considering themselves modest. The true nature of modesty and greed is not imposed from without but lies in observing proper measure. Though one holds the position of Son of Heaven, one does not use nobility to intimidate others; though one possesses all under Heaven, one does not use wealth to toy with others. Calculating the harm and considering the consequences, one sees that it harms one’s nature, and so one declines and does not accept—not to seek fame and reputation. Yao and Shun ruled as emperors and brought harmony, not to benevolently govern all under Heaven, but to avoid letting beauty harm their lives. Shanjuan and Xu You were offered the throne but refused, not out of empty humility, but to avoid letting affairs harm themselves. All of them pursued what benefited them and declined what harmed them. Though all under Heaven called them worthy, they could have accepted, but they did not do so for the sake of fame and reputation.\"\n\nWuzu said: \"If one must cling to reputation, endure bodily hardship, reject sweetness, and restrict nourishment to preserve life, then one is no better than a long-suffering invalid who lingers on without dying.\"\n\nZhihe said: \"Equilibrium brings fortune, while excess brings harm—this is true of all things, and wealth is the most extreme case. Now, the rich man’s ears are filled with the sounds of bells, drums, pipes, and flutes; his mouth savors the flavors of fine meats and sweet wines, distracting his mind and causing him to neglect his affairs—this may be called disorder. Engulfed in surging qi, he moves as if burdened with a heavy load while climbing—this may be called suffering. Greedy for wealth, he takes comfort in it; greedy for power, he exhausts himself. At rest, he is drowned in it; in motion, he is overwhelmed by it—this may be called illness. Driven by the desire for wealth and the pursuit of profit, he is filled to the ears yet does not know to avoid it, pressing forward without cease—this may be called disgrace. Wealth accumulates without use; he clings to it without release, his heart filled with sorrow and bitterness, endlessly seeking more—this may be called worry. Within, he suspects the treachery of those who flatter and beg; without, he fears the harm of bandits and thieves. He surrounds himself with high towers and deep moats and dares not travel alone—this may be called fear. These six are the greatest harms under Heaven, yet all are forgotten and unexamined. When calamity strikes, one seeks to exhaust one’s nature and deplete one’s wealth, hoping in vain to return to a single day of carefree ease. Thus, when one gazes upon fame, it is not seen; when one seeks profit, it is not obtained. Yet one wearies the mind and wears out the body in contention for these—is this not delusion?\"\n\n---\n\n*The Southern Florescence: The True Classic, Scroll Five, Miscellaneous Chapters – \"Discourse on Swords\"*\n\nLong ago, King Wen of Zhao delighted in swords. Over three thousand swordsmen gathered as retainers at his gates, clashing before him day and night. Each year, more than a hundred died or were wounded, yet his passion never waned. After three years of this, the state declined, and the feudal lords plotted against it. The crown prince, Li, grew anxious and offered a reward to his attendants: \"Whoever can persuade the king to abandon his fondness for swordsmen shall receive a thousand gold pieces.\" His attendants said, \"Zhuangzi is the one who can do this.\"\n\nThe crown prince then sent messengers bearing a thousand gold pieces to present to Zhuangzi. Zhuangzi refused the gift but accompanied the messengers to see the crown prince. He asked, \"What instruction does the crown prince have for me, that you offer me a thousand gold pieces?\" The crown prince replied, \"I have heard that you, Master, are enlightened and sagely. I humbly present this thousand gold as a gift for your attendants. If you refuse, how dare I speak further?\" Zhuangzi said, \"I have heard that the crown prince wishes to employ me to put an end to the king’s fondness for swords. If I persuade the king but fail to align with his wishes, or if I do not meet the crown prince’s expectations, I will face execution. How then could I concern myself with gold? If I persuade the king and meet the crown prince’s expectations, what in the state of Zhao could I not obtain?\"\n\nThe crown prince said, \"Indeed. My father, the king, sees only swordsmen.\" Zhuangzi replied, \"Very well. I am skilled in the use of the sword.\" The crown prince said, \"But the swordsmen my father sees all have unkempt hair, bristling sideburns, and drooping caps with coarse tassels. Their robes are short in the back, their eyes glower, and their speech is harsh. The king delights in them. If you, Master, appear before him in scholar’s robes, the matter will surely go awry.\" Zhuangzi said, \"I request to prepare a swordsman’s attire.\" After three days of preparing the attire, he met with the crown prince, who then accompanied him to see the king. The king drew his unsheathed sword and waited.\n\nZhuangzi entered the palace gates without haste and did not bow upon seeing the king. The king said, \"What instruction do you bring me, that the crown prince has gone to such lengths?\" Zhuangzi replied, \"I have heard that Your Majesty delights in swords, and so I have come to present my swordsmanship.\" The king asked, \"What can your sword do?\" Zhuangzi said, \"My sword can cut down one man every ten paces, and its edge never falters for a thousand li.\"",

Above, it cleaves the floating clouds; below, it severs the earth’s foundations. Once this sword is wielded, it rectifies the feudal lords, and all under heaven submits. Such is the Sword of the Son of Heaven.\n\nKing Wen, bewildered, lost his composure and asked, \"What of the Sword of the Feudal Lords?\"\nZhuangzi replied, \"The Sword of the Feudal Lords has its edge in the wise and brave, its guard in the pure and incorrupt, its spine in the worthy and good, its base in the loyal and victorious, and its blade in the heroic and outstanding. This sword, when thrust forward, likewise knows no rival; when raised, nothing stands above it; when pressed downward, nothing lies beneath it; when swung, nothing flanks it. Above, it models the round heavens to follow the Three Luminaries; below, it models the square earth to follow the Four Seasons; within, it discerns the people’s will to pacify the four quarters. Once this sword is wielded, it strikes like thunder, and within the four borders, none fail to submit and heed their lord’s command. Such is the Sword of the Feudal Lords.\"\n\nThe king asked, \"What of the Sword of the Commoner?\"\nZhuangzi replied, \"The Sword of the Commoner is wielded by those with disheveled hair, unkempt sideburns, drooping caps, frayed tassels, short-backed robes, glaring eyes, and contentious speech. They clash before one another, severing necks above and piercing livers and lungs below. This sword of the commoner differs not from fighting cocks—once their lives are spent, they serve no purpose in the affairs of state. Now, Your Majesty, possessing the station of the Son of Heaven, yet favoring the sword of the commoner—I humbly deem this unworthy of you.\"\n\nThe king then led Zhuangzi up to the hall. The royal steward presented the feast, and the king circled the table thrice. Zhuangzi said, \"Your Majesty, be seated and compose yourself. The matter of the swords has been presented in full.\"\n\nThereupon, King Wen did not leave his palace for three months, and the swordsmen all perished in their quarters.\n\n---\n\nFrom *The True Classic of Southern Florescence*, Scroll Five, \"Miscellaneous Chapters: The Fisherman, Thirty-One\"\n\nConfucius wandered through the forest of black curtains and rested upon the secluded altar. His disciples read aloud while Confucius strummed the zither and sang. Before the melody was half-finished, an old fisherman descended from his boat and approached. His temples and brows were white, his hair unbound, his sleeves tattered. He strode up from the marsh, halted at the shore, left hand resting on his knee, right hand cradling his chin, and listened. When the song ended, he beckoned to Zilu and Zigong, who both stepped forward.\n\nThe stranger pointed at Confucius and asked, \"What is that man doing?\"\nZilu replied, \"He is a gentleman of Lu.\"\nThe stranger asked of his lineage.\nZilu answered, \"The lineage of Kong.\"\nThe stranger asked, \"And what does this Kong lineage practice?\"\nZilu did not respond, but Zigong answered, \"The Kong lineage cultivates loyalty and trust in their nature, embodies benevolence and righteousness in their conduct, refines ritual and music, and selects human relationships. Above, they serve the rulers of the age with loyalty; below, they transform the common people, seeking to benefit all under heaven. Such is the practice of the Kong lineage.\"\n\nThe stranger asked again, \"Is he a lord with lands?\"\nZigong said, \"No.\"\n\"A counselor to kings and marquises?\"\nZigong said, \"No.\"\nThe stranger laughed and turned away, saying as he walked, \"Benevolent, to be sure—but I fear he will not escape harm to himself. He wearies his mind and wears his body, endangering his true nature. Alas, how far he has strayed from the Dao!\"\n\nZigong returned and reported this to Confucius. Confucius pushed aside his zither and rose, saying, \"Is he a sage?\" He descended to seek the man, reaching the marsh’s edge just as the fisherman was about to pole his boat away. Glancing back, he saw Confucius, turned toward him, and stood still. Confucius retreated, bowed twice, and stepped forward.\n\nThe stranger asked, \"What do you seek?\"\nConfucius replied, \"Earlier, sir, you left with words unfinished. I, Qiu, am unworthy and did not grasp their meaning. I humbly awaited in your wake, hoping to hear even the sound of your cough or spit to complete my instruction.\"\n\nThe stranger said, \"Ah! How earnest is your love of learning!\"\nConfucius bowed twice and rose, saying, \"From my youth I have cultivated learning, and now, at sixty-nine, I have yet to hear the ultimate teaching. I dare not but remain open-hearted.\"\n\nThe stranger said, \"Like attracts like, and like sounds resonate—this is the principle of heaven. Allow me to expound what I possess and apply it to your concerns. What you concern yourself with are human affairs. The Son of Heaven, feudal lords, great officers, and commoners—when these four are properly aligned, governance is at its finest. If these four abandon their stations, no greater disorder exists. When offices fulfill their duties and people attend to their tasks, there is no encroachment. Thus:\n\nFor the commoner, the worries are: fields lying fallow, homes exposed to the elements, clothing and food insufficient, taxes unpaid, discord between wife and concubine, and disorder between elders and juniors.\n\nFor the great officer, the worries are: incompetence in office, official duties neglected, conduct impure, subordinates idle, achievements unrecognized, and ranks and emoluments unstable.\n\nFor the feudal lord, the worries are: no loyal ministers in court, the state in chaos, craftsmen lacking skill, tribute unrefined, falling behind in spring and autumn ceremonies, and disobeying the Son of Heaven.\n\nFor the Son of Heaven’s ministers, the worries are: yin and yang out of harmony, cold and heat untimely, harming the myriad things; feudal lords violent and disorderly, seizing and attacking one another, ravaging the people; ritual and music unrestrained, resources exhausted, human relationships unadorned, and the hundred clans licentious.\n\nNow, you, sir, possess neither the authority of a lord or minister above nor the office of a great officer below, yet you presume to refine ritual and music, select human relationships, and transform the common people. Is this not overreaching?\n\nMoreover, people have eight flaws, and affairs have four perils—these cannot be left unexamined.\n\nTo attend to what is not one’s affair is called *meddling*;\nTo advance where none heed is called *obsequiousness*;\nTo guide speech by others’ expectations is called *flattery*;\nTo speak without discerning right or wrong is called *sycophancy*;\nTo delight in speaking of others’ faults is called *slander*;\nTo sever friendships and divide kin is called *treachery*;\nTo praise falsely and deceive to harm others is called *connivance*;\nTo accept both good and bad without distinction, flattering both sides to advance one’s desires, is called *perfidy*.\"",

      "translated_text": "These eight flaws disrupt others outwardly and harm oneself inwardly—noble persons do not befriend such men, and enlightened rulers do not employ them.\n\nAs for the four perils:\nTo delight in managing great affairs, altering and overturning constants in pursuit of merit and fame is called *presumption*;\nTo monopolize knowledge, arrogate authority, and encroach upon others through self-assertion is called *greed*;\nTo persist in error despite correction, and grow more obstinate when admonished, is called *obduracy*;\nTo approve only what aligns with oneself, and dismiss even the good if it differs, is called *arrogance*.\nThese are the four perils.\n\nOnly by shedding the eight flaws and avoiding the four perils can one begin to receive instruction.\n\nConfucius sighed deeply, bowed twice, and rose, saying: \"I was twice exiled from Lu, had my lands pared away in Wei, was felled like a tree in Song, and besieged between Chen and Cai. I know not what faults I committed to incur these four slanders—why was this?\"\n\nThe guest’s expression turned somber as he replied: \"How deeply you resist awakening! There was a man who feared his shadow and loathed his footprints, and so ran to escape them. The more he lifted his feet, the more prints appeared; the faster he ran, the closer his shadow clung. Believing himself still too slow, he ran without cease until he collapsed and died. He did not know that standing in shade would still his shadow, or that stillness would erase his prints—how utterly foolish!\n\nYou scrutinize the questions of benevolence and righteousness, examine the boundaries of sameness and difference, observe the shifts of activity and stillness, adjust the measures of giving and receiving, order the passions of like and dislike, and harmonize the rhythms of joy and anger—yet you nearly escape none of this. If you diligently cultivate yourself, guard your authenticity, and return things to others, you will be free from entanglements. To neglect self-cultivation while seeking from others is to miss the mark entirely.\"\n\nConfucius sighed again and asked: \"May I ask what is meant by *authenticity*?\"\n\nThe guest replied: \"Authenticity is the utmost of sincerity. Without sincerity, one cannot move others. Thus, forced weeping, though sorrowful, lacks grief; forced anger, though stern, lacks awe; forced affection, though smiling, lacks harmony. True grief is silent yet mournful; true anger is unexpressed yet awe-inspiring; true affection is unsmiling yet harmonious. When authenticity resides within, the spirit manifests without—this is why authenticity is prized.\n\nApplied to human affairs:\nIn serving parents, it is *filial devotion*;\nIn serving rulers, it is *loyal integrity*;\nIn drinking, it is *joy*;\nIn mourning, it is *grief*.\nLoyal integrity is measured by merit; drinking, by joy; mourning, by grief; serving parents, by suitability. When merit is perfected, no single path is prescribed.\n\nServing parents with suitability requires no discussion of means;\nDrinking with joy requires no selection of vessels;\nMourning with grief requires no inquiry into ritual.\nRitual is what世俗 constructs; authenticity is what one receives from Heaven—natural and unalterable. Thus, the sage models Heaven and values authenticity, unbound by convention. The foolish do the opposite: unable to model Heaven, they fret over others, ignorant of authenticity’s worth, drifting with俗 and thus never sufficient. Alas, you were steeped in human artifice early on and only now hear of the Great Dao!\"\n\nConfucius bowed twice and rose again: \"Today I have met you as if by Heaven’s grace. You deign to instruct me, though I am no better than a servant. May I ask where you dwell, that I might follow and complete my study of the Great Dao?\"\n\nThe guest said: \"I have heard that those who can journey with you may be led to the subtleties of the Dao; those who cannot, do not grasp the Dao—beware of sharing it with them, lest you bring harm upon yourself. Strive on! I leave you now, I leave you now.\" With that, he poled his boat away, vanishing among the green reeds.\n\nYan Yuan turned the carriage, and Zilu handed Confucius the reins, but Confucius did not look back. He waited until the water’s ripples stilled and no sound of oars could be heard before daring to board. Zilu stepped beside the carriage and asked: \"I have long served you, yet never seen you meet another with such reverence. Kings of ten thousand chariots and lords of a thousand have met you without failing to observe proper courtesy, yet you still bore a haughty air. Now this old fisherman, leaning on his pole, stood upright before you, and you bent at the waist like a chiming stone, bowing repeatedly in response—was this not excessive? Your disciples all find it strange. How did the fisherman deserve such deference?\"\n\nConfucius leaned on the crossbar and sighed: \"How difficult you are to transform, Zilu! You have been steeped in ritual and righteousness for so long, yet your coarse and vulgar heart remains. Come closer, and I will tell you: To meet an elder without respect is a breach of ritual; to meet a worthy without reverence is a lack of benevolence. If he were not a perfected person, he could not humble himself before others. Without humbling oneself with precision, one cannot attain authenticity—and thus risks lasting harm to the self. Alas, nothing is more disastrous to a person than a lack of benevolence, and you alone cling to it!\n\nMoreover, the Dao is the path by which all things proceed. Creatures that lose it die; those that attain it live. In affairs, opposing it brings failure; following it brings success. Thus, wherever the Dao resides, the sage reveres it. This old fisherman possesses the Dao—how could I not revere him?\"",

Berwyn Puren stood facing north, leaning on his staff and pressing it against his chin. After standing for a while, he departed without a word. The attendant informed Liezi, who rushed out in haste, shoes in hand, and caught up at the gate, saying: \"Master, since you have come, will you not prescribe a remedy?\"\n\nHe replied: \"Enough. I already told you that others would safeguard you—and indeed, they do. It is not that you can make others protect you, but that you cannot prevent them from doing so. Why then do you seek to impress or display your uniqueness? If you must stir emotions and disrupt your fundamental nature, it is meaningless. Those who accompany you in your wanderings will not warn you: their petty words are all poison. Unaware and unenlightened, how can they scrutinize one another? The cunning toil, the wise fret, the incapable seek nothing. Eat your fill and roam freely, drifting like an untethered boat, empty and unbound in your wanderings.\"\n\nIn Zheng, there was a man named Huan who groaned and wailed in the land of Qiu Shi. After three years, Huan became a Confucian scholar. His virtue moistened the land for nine *li*, and his beneficence extended to three clans, even converting his younger brother to Mohism. The Confucians and Mohists debated, and their father sided with Mo Di. Ten years later, Huan took his own life. His father dreamed of him, saying: \"It was I who made your son a Mohist. Why did you not examine his true nature?

After three years, his skill was perfected, yet there was no use for his craft.

Yielding to weapons, their actions become demands. Weapons, once relied upon, bring ruin.\n\nThe petty man’s knowledge does not extend beyond bundled firewood and bamboo slips. He exhausts his spirit in trivial pursuits, yet seeks to guide and transform all things, to embody the Great Unity and the formless void. Such a one is deluded by the cosmos, burdened by form, and unaware of the Great Beginning. The perfected person, however, returns their spirit to the beginningless and delights in the realm of Nothing Whatever. Water flows without form, issuing forth into the Great Purity.\n\nAlas!

On his departure, he received several carriages; the King of Qin was pleased with him and added a hundred more. Returning to Song, he saw Zhuangzi and said: \"To dwell in a cramped lane, impoverished and weaving sandals, with a withered neck and sallow face—this is what I was unskilled at. To awaken the lord of ten thousand chariots and follow with a hundred carriages—this is what I excel at.\"\n\nZhuangzi replied: \"The King of Qin had an illness and summoned physicians. Those who lanced boils and drained abscesses received one carriage; those who licked his hemorrhoids received five. The baser the treatment, the more carriages they received. Did you, perchance, treat his hemorrhoids? How else could you have obtained so many carriages? Begone!\"\n\nDuke Ai of Lu asked Yan Wen, saying: \"I regard Confucius as the pillar of the state—will the realm be secure?\"\n\nYan Wen replied: \"It is perilous, verging on collapse!

      "translated_text": "To err may yet be permissible. Now, if the people are led to abandon substance for falsity, this is no way to guide them. Considering posterity, it would be better to cease such practices. Governance is difficult—what is imposed upon others yet never forgotten is not the spontaneous bounty of Heaven. Merchants and traders are held in contempt; even when ranked among others by office, the spirit does not acknowledge them. External punishments are meted out by metal and wood; internal punishments arise from movement and transgression. When petty men incur external punishments, metal and wood interrogate them; when they incur internal punishments, yin and yang consume them. Only the true person can escape both external and internal punishments.\n\nConfucius said: \"The human heart is more treacherous than mountains and rivers, harder to fathom than Heaven. Heaven at least has its seasons—spring, autumn, winter, summer—and its fixed times of dawn and dusk. But humans conceal their true nature beneath thick appearances and deep emotions. Thus, some appear earnest yet are deceitful; some seem long-suffering yet are unworthy; some are compliant out of fear yet achieve success; some are resolute yet lax; some are slow yet sharp. Therefore, those who rush toward righteousness as if parched may flee from it as if scorched. Thus, the noble person employs them at a distance to observe their loyalty, employs them closely to observe their reverence, employs them in complexity to observe their ability, questions them abruptly to observe their wisdom, sets urgent deadlines to observe their trustworthiness, entrusts them with wealth to observe their benevolence, warns them of danger to observe their integrity, intoxicates them with wine to observe their restraint, and mingles with them in various settings to observe their demeanor. When these nine tests are complete, the unworthy are revealed.\n\n\"Zheng Kaofu, upon receiving his first appointment, bowed low; upon his second, bent at the waist; upon his third, stooped to the ground, creeping along the wall—who would dare not follow the proper way? But those like him, upon their first appointment, strut like Lü Ju; upon their second, dance atop their carriages; upon their third, address their elders by name—who would align with Tang or Xu?\n\n\"There is no greater harm than virtue with intent, and intent with eyes. When intent has eyes, it turns inward; turning inward, it fails. There are five baleful virtues, and the foremost is the virtue of the center. What is the virtue of the center? It is when one prides oneself on what one favors and disparages what one does not do.\n\n\"Poverty has eight extremes, success three certainties, and the body six repositories. Beauty, whiskers, height, size, strength, loveliness, courage, and boldness—when all eight surpass others, they lead to ruin. Humility, yielding, and timidity that fall short of others—these three lead to success. Wisdom and intelligence that reach outward breed resentment; courage and boldness invite many grudges; benevolence and righteousness incur many demands.\n\n\"Those who grasp the essence of life are like puppets; those who grasp knowledge are diminished; those who grasp the great mandate follow it; those who grasp the small mandate encounter it.\n\n\"A man who had an audience with the King of Song was granted ten carriages, with which he proudly confronted Zhuangzi. Zhuangzi said: 'By the river lived a poor family who made their living weaving rushes. Their son, diving into the depths, found a pearl worth a thousand gold pieces. His father said to him: \"Bring a stone to smash it!\" For a pearl worth a thousand gold pieces must lie beneath the chin of the black dragon in the ninefold abyss. You could only have obtained it because the dragon was asleep. Had the black dragon awakened, what scrap of you would remain? Now, the depths of the state of Song are not merely a ninefold abyss; the ferocity of the King of Song is not merely that of a black dragon. You could only have obtained those carriages because he was asleep. Had the King of Song awakened, you would be reduced to dust.'\n\n\"Another man boasted to Zhuangzi, who replied to his messenger: 'Have you seen the sacrificial ox? It is clothed in embroidered robes and fed with fine grain and beans. Yet when it is led into the great temple, though it might wish to be a lone calf, could it ever be so?'\n\n\"As Zhuangzi neared death, his disciples wished to give him a lavish burial. Zhuangzi said: 'I take heaven and earth as my inner and outer coffins, the sun and moon as my paired jades, the stars and constellations as my pearls and beads, and the myriad things as my funeral gifts.

      "translated_text": "\"‘I fear the crows and kites will feed upon you, Master.’\nZhuangzi said: ‘Above, I would be food for crows and kites; below, I would be food for mole-crickets and ants. To snatch from one to give to the other—how partial you are! To level with what is not level is to make leveling itself unlevel; to verify with what is not verifiable is to make verification itself unverifiable. The enlightened are but servants of the numinous; the numinous verifies them. That the enlightened cannot surpass the numinous has long been so—yet fools rely on what they see to impose upon others. Their merit lies in externals—is this not lamentable?’\n\n*Southern Florescence Perfected Scripture, Scroll Five: \"The World\" (Miscellaneous Chapters, Chapter Thirty-Three)*\n\nThe world’s cultivators of methods and arts are many, each believing their achievements cannot be surpassed. Where, then, does the ancient *Dao*-art reside? It resides nowhere that it is not. How does the numinous descend? How does enlightenment emerge? The sage is born of it; the king is perfected by it—all originate from the One.\n\nNot departing from the Source is called the Celestial Person.\nNot departing from the essence is called the Spirit Person.\nNot departing from the real is called the Perfected Person.\nTaking heaven as their source, virtue as their root, and the Dao as their gate, foreshadowing transformation—this is the sage.\nTaking benevolence as kindness, righteousness as principle, ritual as conduct, and music as harmony, suffused with compassion—this is the noble person.\nTaking law as division, names as markers, comparison as verification, and examination as decision—such are the numbers one, two, three, four, by which the hundred officials rank themselves.\nTaking affairs as constancy, clothing and food as primary, multiplying and storing, caring for the old, weak, orphaned, and widowed—all have their means of nurture: this is the governance of the people.\n\nThe ancients were complete in this. They matched the numinous and bright, harmonized heaven and earth, nourished the myriad things, brought harmony to the world, and extended their blessings to the hundred clans. Illuminating the root and the numbers, connecting to the branches and measures, penetrating the six directions and opening the four gates, whether small or great, refined or coarse, their workings were nowhere absent.\n\nWhat is manifest in numbers and measures—old laws and transmitted histories—still abound. What lies in the *Odes*, *Documents*, *Rites*, and *Music*—scholars of Zou and Lu, and girdle-wearing gentlemen—many can expound. The *Odes* convey the will; the *Documents* convey affairs; the *Rites* convey conduct; the *Music* conveys harmony; the *Changes* convey yin and yang; the *Spring and Autumn Annals* convey names and duties.\n\nThese arts spread throughout the world and were established in the Central States, where the hundred schools at times praised and transmitted them. Yet when the world fell into great disorder, worthies and sages were obscured, the Dao and virtue were not unified, and the world grasped at partial insights to esteem themselves. Like ears, eyes, nose, and mouth, each has its clarity but cannot communicate with the others—so too the hundred schools and their arts, each with its strengths, each useful at times. Yet they are not comprehensive, not impartial: they are scholars of a single corner.\n\nTo judge the beauty of heaven and earth, to analyze the principles of the myriad things, to examine the completeness of the ancients—few can fully embrace the beauty of heaven and earth or match the bearing of the numinous and bright. Thus the Way of inner sageliness and outer kingship has become fragmented and obscure, stifled and unexpressed. The people of the world each follow their desires to create their own methods. Alas! The hundred schools have gone forth and not returned—they will surely not unite.\n\nLater scholars, unfortunate not to see the purity of heaven and earth or the great form of the ancients, will see the *Dao*-art torn apart by the world. Not extravagant toward later generations, not wasteful toward the myriad things, not dazzled by numbers and measures, using the inked line to correct themselves and prepare for the world’s emergencies—this is where the ancient *Dao*-art resided. Mo Di and Qin Guli heard its wind and delighted in it.\n\nThey overdid it, making themselves excessively frugal. They created \"Non-Music,\" calling it \"restraint of excess.\" They did not sing in life and wore no mourning in death. Mozi practiced universal love and mutual benefit, rejecting aggression; his Way did not incite anger. He was also fond of broad learning, not distinguishing between schools, not aligning with the former kings. He condemned the ancient rites and music. The Yellow Emperor had *Xianchi*, Yao had *Dazhang*, Shun had *Dashao*, Yu had *Daxia*, Tang had *Dahu*, King Wen had the music of the *Biyong*, and King Wu and the Duke of Zhou composed *Wu*. In ancient mourning rites, noble and base had their forms, high and low their ranks: the Son of Heaven had seven layers of inner and outer coffins, the feudal lords five, great officers three, and scholars two. Yet Mozi alone did not sing in life, wore no mourning in death, and used a paulownia coffin three inches thick without an outer coffin, making this his model. Teaching others thus, he did not love them; practicing it himself, he did not love himself.\n\nThis did not ruin Mozi’s Way. Yet singing but not singing, weeping but not weeping, joyful but not joyful—was this truly fitting? His life was toilsome, his death meager; his Way was overly austere. It made people anxious, made them sorrowful; his conduct was difficult to practice. I fear it cannot be the Way of the sage, for it turns against the hearts of the world, and the world cannot bear it. Though Mozi alone could endure it, how could the plain people of the world do so? Cut off from the world, he was far from the kingly Way.\n\nMozi spoke of the Dao, saying: ‘In ancient times, Yu controlled the floodwaters, dredged the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, and opened the roads to the four barbarians and nine provinces. There were three hundred famous rivers, three thousand tributaries, and countless smaller ones. Yu personally wielded the spade and plow, blending the labors of the world, his calves bare of skin, his shins bare of hair, his hair washed by heavy rains, his body combed by fierce winds, establishing the ten thousand states. Yu was a great sage, yet he wearied his body for the world to this extent.’ Thus later Mohists wore coarse garments of felt and sandals of hemp, toiling day and night without rest, taking self-imposed hardship as their utmost. They said: ‘If we cannot do this, it is not Yu’s Way—we are unworthy to be called Mohists.’\"",

Yet Mozi was truly a man of lofty aspirations in the world, one whose like is sought in vain. Though he withered away, he never abandoned his cause—a man of true talent indeed! Unburdened by convention, unadorned by material things, uncompromising with others, and unyielding to the crowd.\n\nHe longed for the world’s peace to preserve human life, ceasing only when both self and others were sufficiently provided for, thus purifying his heart. Among the ancient arts of the Dao, Song Jian and Yin Wen heard of his teachings and embraced them. They fashioned the Hua Shan cap as a symbol, engaging with all things by first dispelling obstructions. They spoke of the mind’s capacity, calling it \"the mind’s conduct,\" seeking to unite through shame and harmonize the world, proposing to establish this as their guiding principle. They endured insults without feeling dishonored, saving the people’s states, forbidding aggression and halting warfare to end the world’s strife. With this, they traversed the world, persuading rulers above and instructing the people below. Though the world rejected them, they persisted stubbornly, clamoring without cease—thus they were met with weariness above and below yet forced themselves upon others.\n\nYet their selflessness was too great, their personal needs too few. They said: \"Let us fix five *sheng* of rice as sufficient. If the master fears hunger, the disciples, though starving, will not forget the world.\" Day and night without rest, they declared: \"We must surely bring life to the world!\" How lofty were these saviors of the age! They said: \"The noble man does not nitpick, nor does he lend himself to things. What benefits nothing in the world is better left unclarified.\" Externally, they forbade aggression and halted warfare; internally, they sought to diminish desires and reduce excess. Their teachings, whether grand or minute, refined or coarse, extended only so far as this.\n\nImpartial yet not partisan, yielding yet without bias, they stood apart without allegiance, following things without duality, unconcerned with deliberation, unswayed by cunning. They made no distinctions among things, moving with them as one. Among the ancient arts of the Dao, Peng Meng, Tian Pian, and Shen Dao heard of their teachings and embraced them. They took the equality of the ten thousand things as their starting point, saying: \"Heaven can cover them but not bear them; earth can bear them but not cover them; the great Dao can encompass them but not distinguish them.\" Knowing that all things have their \"can\" and \"cannot,\" they said: \"Selection without bias, teaching without omission, the Dao leaves nothing behind.\"\n\nThus Shen Dao discarded knowledge and self, following only what could not be avoided, letting things flow naturally to form his principles. He said: \"To know that one does not know is to approach harm by clinging to knowledge.\" Unburdened by responsibility, he mocked the world’s esteem for worthies; unbound by conduct, he rejected the world’s great sages. He pushed and pulled, severed and cut, adapting to things, setting aside right and wrong, seeking only to avoid harm. Unbound by wisdom or foresight, indifferent to past or future, he simply existed. He moved only when pushed, advanced only when dragged, like a whirling wind, a spinning feather, a grinding stone’s path—whole and without fault, his movements and stillness without error, never incurring blame.\n\nWhy was this so? For things without knowledge have no peril of self-assertion, no burden of wisdom’s use. Their movement and stillness never depart from principle, thus they live without praise. Therefore, he said: \"To be like things without knowledge is enough. There is no need for worthies or sages—such rarity does not lose the Dao.\" Yet the proud and eminent mocked him, saying: \"Shen Dao’s Dao is not the conduct of the living but the principle of the dead—how strange indeed!\"\n\nTian Pian was the same. Studying under Peng Meng, he received \"non-teaching.\" Peng Meng’s master said: \"The ancient Daoists reached the point of neither affirming nor denying.\" Their manner was open and free, beyond words. They constantly opposed others, avoided gathering crowds, and did not fall into rigid judgments. What they called the Dao was not the Dao, yet their words did not err into falsity. Peng Meng, Tian Pian, and Shen Dao did not know the Dao, yet all had glimpsed it.\n\nTaking the root as essence, things as coarse, accumulation as insufficiency, they stood alone in communion with the spiritually luminous. Among the ancient arts of the Dao, Guan Yin and Lao Dan heard of their teachings and embraced them. They built upon the constant of \"non-being\" and \"being,\" governed by the Great One, taking gentleness, weakness, humility, and emptiness as their outward form, and the non-destruction of the ten thousand things as their substance.\n\nGuan Yin said: \"Within oneself, hold nothing; let things manifest naturally. In movement, be like water; in stillness, like a mirror; in response, like an echo. Fading like absence, silent like purity. Those who harmonize gain; those who grasp lose. Never precede others, always follow.\"\n\nLao Dan said: \"Know the masculine, guard the feminine, and be the world’s stream. Know the bright, guard the humble, and be the world’s valley.\" While others sought precedence, he alone took the rear, saying: \"I bear the world’s filth.\" While others sought fullness, he alone took emptiness, having no hoarding and thus abundance—abundant yet unadorned. In conducting himself, he was unhurried and unexhausted, effortless yet mocking cleverness. While others sought fortune, he alone sought preservation through humility, saying: \"I merely avoid blame.\" Taking depth as his root, simplicity as his guiding principle, he said: \"What is rigid breaks; what is sharp is blunted.\"",

Yu was a great sage, yet he wearied his body for the world to this extent.’ Thus later Mohists wore coarse garments of felt and sandals of hemp, toiling day and night without rest, taking self-imposed hardship as their utmost. They said: ‘If we cannot do this, it is not Yu’s Way—we are unworthy to be called Mohists.’\"",

      "translated_text": "Ever tolerant toward all things, never carving away at others—this may be called the ultimate. Ah, Guan Yin and Lao Dan! Truly the vast and authentic persons of antiquity. Still and formless, ever-changing and constant, they moved with death and life, with heaven and earth, with the spirits and the bright. Vast and boundless, where did they go? Fleeting and swift, where did they alight? All things were encompassed, yet none could serve as their refuge. The ancient arts of the Dao resided in this, and Zhuang Zhou, hearing of their influence, delighted in it.\n\nWith meandering discourse, boundless words, and speech without limit, he gave free rein to his ideas without constraint, not relying on rigid perceptions. He saw the world as turbid and unfit for solemn speech, so he used carefree words to let meanings unfold, weighty words to convey truth, and parables to broaden understanding. Alone he communed with the spirit of heaven and earth, never condescending to the myriad things, nor entangled in right and wrong, yet dwelling among the common customs of the age. Though his writings were flawed and rough, they remained unharmed. Though his words were uneven and strange, they were still worthy of contemplation. His fullness could not be exhausted: above, he roamed with the Creator, and below, he befriended those beyond death and life, without beginning or end.\n\nIn his approach to the root, he was vast and expansive, profound and unrestrained. In his grasp of the essence, he was harmonious and ascended to the heights. Yet in responding to transformations and dissolving things, his principles never ran dry, his insights never faded. Vague and obscure, their depths were never fully plumbed.\n\nHui Shi was a man of many methods. His writings filled five carts, but his doctrines were contradictory, and his words often missed the mark. In his exploration of things, he declared: \"What is greatest has no outside—call it the Great One. What is smallest has no inside—call it the Small One. What has no thickness cannot accumulate, yet it spans a thousand miles. Heaven and earth are low; mountains and marshes are level. The sun is both at its zenith and setting; things are both born and dying. Great sameness differs from small sameness—this is called the small sameness and difference. All things are entirely the same and entirely different—this is called the great sameness and difference. The south is both boundless and bounded. Today I go to Yue, yet I arrived yesterday. Linked rings can be unlinked. I know the center of the world—it lies north of Yan and south of Yue. Embracing all things, heaven and earth are one.\"\n\nHui Shi took this as his great principle, and when he surveyed the world to enlighten the debaters, the debaters of the world rejoiced in it together. They delighted in paradoxes: eggs have feathers; a chicken has three feet; Ying possesses the world; a dog can be a sheep; horses lay eggs; tadpoles have tails; fire is not hot; mountains have mouths; wheels do not touch the ground; eyes do not see; pointing does not reach, yet reaching is unceasing; tortoises are longer than snakes; squares are not square, and compasses cannot draw circles; chisels do not fit their handles; the shadow of a flying bird never moves; the speed of an arrow includes moments of neither motion nor stillness; a dog is not a canine; a yellow horse and a black ox make three; a white dog is black; a foal has never had a mother; if you take half of a one-foot stick each day, it will never be exhausted after ten thousand generations.\n\nThe debaters used these to engage with Hui Shi, and their arguments never ceased. Huan Tuan and Gongsun Long, followers of the debaters, adorned people’s minds and altered their intentions. They could win in speech but not convince the heart—such were the confines of the debaters. Hui Shi daily used his knowledge to contend with others, setting himself apart to create marvels with the world’s debaters. This was his foundation.\n\nYet Hui Shi’s eloquence led him to consider himself the most worthy, declaring, \"How grand are heaven and earth!\" He possessed boldness but no defense. In the south there was a man named Huang Liao who asked why heaven and earth did not collapse or sink, and the causes of wind, rain, thunder, and lightning. Hui Shi did not decline to answer, nor did he ponder before responding. He expounded on the myriad things without end, speaking ceaselessly, and though he thought his words too few, he added even more marvels. He took contrariness as truth and sought fame through victory, which is why he never fit in with the crowd. Weak in virtue but strong in things, his path was perilous.\n\nViewing Hui Shi’s abilities through the Dao of heaven and earth, he was like a gnat or a mosquito laboring in vain. What use was he to things? Even if one fills a single principle, one may still say it is insufficient—how much more so for valuing the Dao! Hui Shi could not find peace in this; he scattered himself among the myriad things without weariness, and in the end, he was known only for his skill in debate. Alas for Hui Shi’s talent—soaring yet unfulfilled, chasing the myriad things without return. He was like an echo chasing sound, or a form racing its shadow. How pitiful!",
