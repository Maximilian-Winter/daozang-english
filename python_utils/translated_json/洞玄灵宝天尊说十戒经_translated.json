All who, with valor and might, ascend to the heavens in equal merit, advancing in this endeavor without slackening, shall transcend the Three Realms and become Perfected Ones of the Highest Clarity.\n\nThen the disciples prostrated themselves before the master.\n\n**First:** Refrain from killing; contemplate the lives of all beings.\n\n**Second:** Refrain from lewdness and violating the wives of others;\n**Third:** Refrain from stealing or taking wealth that is not rightfully yours;\n**Fourth:** Refrain from deceit; do not reverse right and wrong in your discourse;\n**Fifth:** Refrain from intoxication; constantly contemplate pure conduct;\n**Sixth:** Foster harmony among clan and kin, without false distinctions of kinship;\n**Seventh:** Upon seeing others do good deeds, rejoice in your heart and lend support;\n**Eighth:** Upon seeing others in distress, assist them in performing meritorious acts;\n**Ninth:** When others harm you, resolve not to seek repayment;\n**Tenth:** Toward all who have yet to attain the Dao/Way, harbor no expectations.\n\nNext, the Fourteen Rules of Conduct for the Body:\nTo a ruler, speak words that bring benevolence to the state;\nTo a father, speak words that bring kindness to his children;\nTo a teacher, speak words that bring love to the multitude;\nTo an elder brother, speak words that bring fraternal respect in conduct;\nTo a minister, speak words that bring loyalty to his sovereign;\nTo a child, speak words that bring filial piety to parents;\nTo a friend, speak words that bring trust in fellowship;\nTo a husband, speak words that bring harmony to the household;\nTo a wife, speak words that bring chastity to her husband;\nTo a disciple, speak words that bring reverence in ritual;\nTo a farmer, speak words that encourage agriculture;\nTo śramaṇas and Daoist practitioners, speak words that turn the heart toward the Dao/Way;\nTo people of foreign lands, speak words that uphold the boundaries of their own domains;\nTo servants and slaves, speak words that bring careful attention to their duties.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy spoke:\nThose who cultivate and uphold these pure precepts ever align with the will of Heaven. Constantly practicing great compassion, they vow to act for the sake of all beings, universally delivering them from this troubled world. Reverently honoring the sacred teachings, they must not grow remiss. Better to die upholding goodness than to live by doing evil. Through unwavering devotion, they may be liberated from the Five Paths and avoid the Three Evil Realms. Guarded by all the heavens and revered by the myriad spirits, those who steadfastly observe these precepts shall naturally attain deliverance across the world.\n\n**The Scripture of the Ten Precepts**\nThis Dharma is truly profound and wondrous,\nFreeing your nine generations from bondage.\nShould one refuse to receive it,\nThey sever themselves from the Dao/Way.\nThose unworthy who presume to accept it\nWill face reproach in this very life.\nUpon death, they fall into the Three Wretched Realms—\nTake heed, and do not obstruct your own benefit.\n\nIn the tenth year of Tianbao of the Great Tang, the year *xinmao*, on the twenty-sixth day of the first lunar month, *gengxu*, Zhang Xuanshi, a male lay disciple of pure faith from Kaiyuan Abbey in Fengyi Village, Yuguan Township, Dunhuang County, Dunhuang Commandery, aged twenty-seven, being but a flesh-bound mortal of no discernment, having received and embodied form, finds his form tainted by the Six Passions. Once the Six Passions take hold, their movement breeds defilement and filth. At times, in what he sees, he is deluded by what he clings to; worldly affairs and karmic conditions arise in succession, drawing forth transgressions and stains, accumulated over lifetimes without end. Thus he revolves within the Three Realms, adrift and forgetful of return; he flows through the Five Paths, bound in long ignorance without awakening.\n\nHaving heard that the Most High and Great Sage expounded the *Ten Precepts* and the *Fourteen Rules for Upholding the Body*, and that by cultivating practice in accordance with this Dharma, one may ascend beyond the Three Realms and attain the highest rank of Supreme Purity, Xuanshi, though dull of nature, earnestly seeks to receive and uphold them. He respectfully approaches Master Ma, a Master of the Three Caverns from Mount Song, to receive the *Ten Precepts* and the *Fourteen Rules for Upholding the Body*, vowing to cultivate, practice, and honor them as the treasure of his being. Should he betray this covenant, he shall not dare to seek pardon from the hells of eternal night.\n\n*(Preceding text missing)*\n...may naturally attain deliverance across the world.\n\n**The Scripture of the Ten Precepts**\n*(Ten Precepts Covenant Text, P.2347)*\n\nIn the third year of Jinglong of the Great Tang, the year *jiyou*, on the eighteenth day of the fifth lunar month, *jiayin*, Tang Zhen, a female lay disciple of pure faith from Chongxu Abbey in Changsha Village, Hongguan Township, Dunhuang County, Shazhou, aged sixteen in her precept years, being but a flesh-bound mortal of no discernment, having received and embodied form, finds her form tainted by the Six Passions. Once the Six Passions take hold, their movement breeds defilement and filth. At times, in what she sees, she is deluded by what she clings to; worldly affairs and karmic conditions arise in succession, drawing forth transgressions and stains, accumulated over lifetimes without end.\n\nAcross the Three Realms she drifts and strays, adrift and forgetful of return;\nthrough the Five Paths she flows and turns, long sunk in delusion, unenlightened.\nHaving heard that the Heavenly Worthy, the Great Sage, expounded the Ten Precepts and the Fourteen Articles for Conducting the Body, she knows that those who cultivate in accordance with the Dao may ascend beyond the Three Realms and attain the highest rank of Supreme Purity.\nThough her nature in the precepts remains dull and ignorant, she earnestly seeks to receive and uphold them. Reverently offering the ritual pledge, she humbly approaches Master North Peak at the Pass to receive the Ten Precepts and the Fourteen Articles for Conducting the Body, vowing to cultivate and revere them as the eternal treasure of her person. Should she violate this covenant, she shall forever languish in the hells, and dares not presume forgiveness.\n\n**The Scripture of the Ten Precepts**\n*(Ten Precepts Covenant Text, P.2350)*\n\nIn the year *jiayin* of the Great Tang, the first lunar month, *gengshen* marking the new moon, on the twenty-second day, *xinsi*, Li Wushang, a male lay disciple of pure faith from Chang’an Village, Longle Township, Dunhuang County, Shazhou, aged twenty-seven in his precept years, presents the ritual pledge in accordance with the Dao.\nToday, he approaches Master Zhang, a Master of the Three Caverns and Middle Peak, residing in Wuqiong Village, Xiaogu Township, Dunhuang County, Shazhou, to receive the Ten Precepts and the Fourteen Articles for Conducting the Body.\nWushang, a flesh-bound mortal, having received and embodied form, finds his form tainted by the Six Passions. Once the Six Passions take hold, their movement breeds defilement and filth. At times, in what he sees, he is deluded by what he clings to; worldly affairs and karmic conditions arise in succession, drawing forth transgressions and stains, accumulated over lifetimes without end.\nAcross the Three Realms he drifts and strays, adrift and forgetful of return; through the Five Paths he flows and turns, long sunk in delusion, unenlightened.\nThus, in accordance with the statutes, he presents the ritual pledge and earnestly seeks to receive, cultivate, and revere the precepts as the eternal treasure of his person. Should he violate this covenant, he shall forever languish in the hells, and dares not presume forgiveness.\n*(Text incomplete at beginning.)* May he attain liberation across the world.\n\n**The Scripture of the Ten Precepts**\n*(Ten Precepts Covenant Text, P.3770)*\n\nIn the second year of Zhide, the year *dingyou*, the fifth lunar month, *wushen* marking the new moon, on the fourteenth day, *xinyou*, Wang Yuzhen, a male lay disciple of good faith from Hongwen Village, Pingkang Township, Dunhuang County, Dunhuang Prefecture, aged sixteen, presents the ritual pledge in accordance with the Dao.\nToday, he approaches Master Suo, a Master of the Three Caverns and Middle Peak, residing in Anchang Village, Pingkang Township, Dunhuang County, Dunhuang Prefecture, to receive the Ten Precepts and the Fourteen Articles for Conducting the Body.\nYuzhen, a flesh-bound mortal, having received and embodied form, finds his form tainted by the Six Passions.\n\nOnce the Six Passions taint the form, every movement breeds defilement. Whether through what is seen or what clings unseen, worldly affairs and karmic conditions arise in succession, summoning the filth of transgression, which accumulates across lifetimes without end. Thus one drifts through the Three Realms, adrift and forgetful of return; cycles through the Five Paths, sunk in long delusion. Therefore, in accordance with the Mysterious Regulations, she presents the ritual pledge in proper form, seeking to receive, uphold, and venerate the precepts, treasuring them forever as the body’s sacred jewel. Should she violate this covenant, she shall be bound in the eternal darkness of hell, and dares not plead for absolution.\n\n**The Scripture of the Ten Precepts**\n*(Ten Precepts Covenant Text, Zhensongtang Collection)*\n\nIn the *jiayin* year of the Great Era, the first lunar month, *gengshen* marking the new moon, on the twenty-second day, *xinsi*, Yin Zhiqing, a female lay disciple of pure faith from the Divine Farmer Hamlet, Hongchi Township, Dunhuang County, Shazhou, aged eleven, presents the ritual pledge in accordance with the Dao. Today, she approaches Master Zhang, a Master of the Three Caverns and Middle Peak, residing in Wuqiong Hamlet, Xiaogu Township, Dunhuang County, Shazhou, to receive the Ten Precepts and the Fourteen Articles for Conducting the Body. Zhiqing, a flesh-bound mortal, having received and embodied form, finds her form tainted by the Six Passions. Once the Six Passions taint the form, every movement breeds defilement. Whether through what is seen or what clings unseen, worldly affairs and karmic conditions arise in succession, summoning the filth of transgression, which accumulates across lifetimes without end. Thus one drifts through the Three Realms, adrift and forgetful of return; cycles through the Five Paths, sunk in long delusion. Therefore, in accordance with the Mysterious Regulations, she presents the ritual pledge in proper form, seeking to receive, uphold, and venerate the precepts, treasuring them forever as the body’s sacred jewel. Should she violate this covenant, she shall be bound in the eternal darkness of hell, and dares not plead for absolution.\n\n*(Ten Precepts Covenant Text, P.3417)*\n\nIn the second year of Jingyun of the Great Tang, the *xinhai* year, the eighth lunar month, *gengwu* marking the new moon of the third intercalary month, on the twenty-fourth day, *jisi*, Jing Xian, a lay disciple of pure faith from Chuntai Hamlet, Longquan Township, Litang County, Yongzhou, aged twenty-seven, presents the ritual pledge. Xian, a flesh-bound mortal of dull awareness, having received and embodied form, finds his form tainted by the Six Passions. Once the Six Passions taint the form, every movement breeds defilement. Whether through what is seen or what clings unseen, worldly affairs and karmic conditions arise in succession, summoning the filth of transgression, which accumulates across lifetimes without end. Thus one drifts through the Three Realms, adrift and forgetful of return; cycles through the Five Paths, sunk in long delusion. Having heard that the Heavenly Worthy, the Great Sage, expounded the Ten Precepts and the Fourteen Articles for Conducting the Body, and that those who cultivate them in accordance with the Dao may ascend beyond the Three Realms and attain the highest rank of Supreme Clarity, Xian, though benighted, earnestly seeks to receive them. He respectfully presents the ritual pledge in proper form and approaches Master Zhang, a Master of the Three Caverns and Middle Peak, residing in Dongming Abbey, Huaiyin Township, Chang’an County, Yongzhou, to receive the Ten Precepts and the Fourteen Articles for Conducting the Body, vowing to cultivate and venerate them, treasuring them forever as the body’s sacred jewel. Should he violate this covenant, he shall be bound in the eternal darkness of hell, and dares not plead for absolution.\n\n**The Scripture of the Most High Numinous Treasure’s Exclusive Exposition of the Ten Precepts** concludes.",
