  "full_translation": "The *Yellow Emperor’s Four Passages* [Warring States Period] by an Anonymous Author\n\n**The Dao/Way and Law**\nThe Dao/Way generates Law.\nLaw is that which draws out virtue/power and loss, and clarifies what is crooked and straight.\n\nThose who hold the Dao/Way in their mouths\nGenerate Law yet dare not violate it.\nLaw is established yet dare not be abandoned.\n\nIf one can regulate oneself with Law,\nThen one perceives the knowledge of the world\nAnd is no longer confused.\n\n**The Origin of All Things**\nEmpty and formless, its essence is profound and obscure—\nThe source from which all things arise.\n\nLife brings harm: called *desire*, called *not knowing contentment*.\nLife must move: movement brings harm—\nCalled *acting without due time*, called *acting at the wrong time*.\n\nAction has purpose: purpose brings harm—\nCalled *contrariness*, called *inappropriateness*, not knowing what to use.\nAction must have speech: speech brings harm—\nCalled *untrustworthiness*, called *not revering others*, called *self-deception*, called *hollow boasting*, using insufficiency as excess.\n\nThus, from the same obscure origin,\nSome die, some live;\nSome fail, some succeed.\nCalamity and blessing share the same Dao/Way,\nYet none know their true source.\n\nThe Dao/Way of knowing is only in the *Empty and Formless*.\nThe *Empty and Formless* solidifies into *form and name*,\nAnd thus *form and name* are established—\nThen the distinction between black and white is clear.\n\nTherefore, those who hold the Dao/Way and observe the world\nDo not cling, do not dwell,\nDo not act, do not favor.\nThus, in the world, when there are matters,\nNone escape the *form and name* and the labels they bear.\n\nOnce *form and name* are set and labels are fixed,\nThere is no place to flee or hide from their truth.\n\nThe public must be clear,\nAnd the most clear bring *virtue/power*.\nThe most upright are serene,\nAnd the most serene are sage.\nThe impartial know wisdom,\nAnd the wisest are the world’s measure.\n\n**Judging with Balance and Scrutiny**\nWeigh with scales, measure with the heavens’ standard.\nIn the world, when there are matters,\nThere must be clever proofs.\n\nIf matters are as straight as wood,\nAnd their abundance like stored grain—\nOnce the bushels and stones are in place,\nAnd the measurements are laid out,\nThen none can escape their truth.\n\nWhen measurements are complete,\nThen govern and control them.\n\n**The Mysterious Workings of Nature**\nSevered yet returning, lost yet restored—\nWho knows their essence?\n\nDead yet living, turning calamity into blessing,\nHolding to the limits of their Dao/Way,\nAnd seeking without *form and name*—\nThus one knows the source of calamity and blessing,\nThe Dao/Way of transformation,\nBalanced and at rest.\n\n**Misalignment with the Dao/Way**\nLight and heavy not in balance—\nThis is called *losing the Dao/Way*.\n\nHeaven and Earth have fixed constants,\nThe common people have fixed affairs,\nNobility and lowliness have fixed ranks,\nMinisterial servants have fixed duties,\nAnd the governance of the people has fixed measures.\n\nThe fixed constants of Heaven and Earth:\nThe four seasons, eclipses and brightness, life and death, yielding and firm.\n\nThe fixed affairs of the common people:\nMen till the fields, women weave.\n\nThe fixed ranks of nobility and lowliness:\nThe worthy do not obstruct, the unworthy do not interfere.\n\nThe fixed duties of ministerial servants:\nAssign tasks without exceeding their abilities.\n\nThe fixed measures for governing the people:\nRemove private favor and establish the public.\n\nTo alter the fixed and exceed the measures,\nAnd to use the unusual to counter—\nThe upright and unusual have their ranks,\nYet *form and name* do not depart.\n\nAll matters, great or small,\nNaturally find their place.\n\nLife and death, success and failure—\nThings naturally have their names.\nOnce *form and name* are defined,\nThings naturally have their truth.\n\nThus, only those who hold the Dao/Way\nCan ascend to understand Heaven’s reversals,\nAnd in the midst grasp the balance between ruler and subject.\nThey must secretly observe the end and beginning of all things,\nYet not act as their master.\n\nThus, they can attain the utmost simplicity and subtlety,\nBoundless and without *form and name*,\nAnd then they can serve as the world’s standard.\n\n**The Dao/Way and Law of the State**\nIf a state loses its proper sequence,\nThen the ancestral altars will become its great rectifiers.\nTo seize without giving,\nThe state will inevitably perish.\n\nIf one exhausts Heaven’s limits,\nThe declining will rise again.\n\nTo punish and prohibit improperly,\nOne will instead suffer the calamity.\n\nTo punish and prohibit those deserving death and destruction,\nThe state will become a ruin.\n\nTo combine without usurpation—\nThis is called *Heaven’s virtue/power*.\n\nHeaven and Earth are impartial,\nThe four seasons do not cease.\n\nHeaven and Earth established,\nThe sage therefore follows.\n\nTo exceed the limits and lose the proper—\nHeaven will bring calamity.\n\nIf man overpowers Heaven,\nBe cautious and avoid what is improper.\n\nIf Heaven overpowers man,\nConform and proceed together.\nFirst bend, then extend,\nAnd one will exhaust Heaven’s limits\nWithout usurping Heaven’s virtue/power.\n\nTo combine the states of others,\nTo fortify their city walls,\nTo dwell in their halls and temples,\nTo listen to their bells and drums,\nTo exploit their resources and wealth,\nTo take their children as wives—\nThis is called *invading with wantonness*,\nAnd the state will face peril, ruin, and destruction.\n\nThus, only the sage can exhaust Heaven’s limits\nAnd use Heaven’s proper measures.\n\nThe Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth\nDoes not exceed three *virtues/powers*.\nIf *virtue/power* is complete yet one does not stop,\nOne’s body will be endangered and calamity will come.\n\nThus, the sage’s punishments\nWhen combining others’ states,\nOverthrow their city walls,\nBurn their bells and drums,\nDistribute their wealth and resources,\nScatter their children,\nAnd divide their lands\nTo reward the worthy—\nThis is called *Heaven’s virtue/power*.\n\nIf *virtue/power* is complete yet not abandoned,\nThe later generations will not meet calamity.\n\nDo not secretly usurp in the sun,\nDo not secretly usurp in the shade,\nDo not exhaust the land,\nDo not seize the people,\nDo not form factions.\n\nThose who secretly usurp in the sun—\nHeaven will take away their light.\nThose who secretly usurp in the shade—\nThe land will become desolate.\nThose who exhaust the land—\nHeaven will send armies against them.\nThose who seize the people—\nThey will be scattered to the four directions.\nThose who form factions—\nWill be attacked within their own borders.\n\nSecretly usurping in the sun brings illness,\nSecretly usurping in the shade brings famine,\nExhausting the land brings loss of territory,\nSeizing the people brings loss of subjects,\nForming factions brings chaos—\nThese are the five *inversions*,\nAnd all five *inversions* realized,\nWill bring *just deserts*—\nThe firmness of Heaven’s retribution,\nChanging what is fixed, disrupting what is constant,\nUsurping control and altering the seasons—\nIf one’s heart desires to act thus,\nOne’s body will be endangered and calamity will come.\nThis is called *exceeding the limits and losing the proper*.\n\nThe realm’s cycle:\nIn the first year, follow its customs,\nIn the second year, apply its virtue,\nIn the third year, the people will prosper,\nIn the fourth year, issue decrees,\nIn the fifth year, punish with justice,\nIn the sixth year, the people will revere and obey,\nIn the seventh year, the realm may be made right.\n\nIn the first year, follow its customs—\nThen the people’s ways are known.\nIn the second year, apply its virtue—\nThen the people’s strength is harnessed.\nIn the third year, levy no taxes—\nThen the people will gain.\nIn the fourth year, issue decrees—\nThen the people will revere and obey.\nIn the fifth year, punish with justice—\nThen the people will suffer.\nIn the sixth year, [the ruler] must [act with restraint].\nIn the seventh year, the realm may be made right—\nThen victory over strong foes and fitting adversaries is achieved.\n\nCustoms are the harmony of the people’s hearts.\nVirtue is the love and encouragement of the people.\nProsperity means the release of prohibitions and the easing of market taxes.\nDecrees mean organizing the people into groups of ten and fifty, selecting the worthy and unworthy, and making distinctions.\nPunishing with justice means crimes are punished without pardon.\n[The ruler] must [act with restraint].\nWhen the realm is made right, the people will die for their lord.\n\nIf decrees are issued and obeyed,\nThen the realm reaches its zenith—\nOne Dao, one heart,\nThe ruler’s words are unassailable,\nThe people have no other intent—\nThen the realm may be steadied for battle.\n\nWhen decrees are issued and obeyed,\nThis is the way of customs.\nWhen men and women are encouraged,\nThis is love.\nWhen the people are moved or calmed,\nNone will fail to listen—\nThis is timing.\nWhen rewards are given without virtue,\nWhen punishments are meted out without grievance,\nThis is just measure.\nWhen rank and status are distinguished,\nThen the worthy and unworthy are not confused—\nThis is the way of decline.\n\nWhen clothing and service are uniform,\nThen rank and status are equal—\nThis is the ruin of the realm.\nWhen there are no thieves or deceivers,\nWhen hearts are without guile,\nThen sufficient food and clothing,\nAnd punishments will be inevitable.\n\nWith abundance to defend,\nThe realm cannot be uprooted.\nWith insufficiency to attack,\nOne will only bring self-harm.\n\nHeaven has times of life and death,\nThe realm has times of governance and destruction.\nFollowing Heaven’s life to nourish life,\nThis is called **culture** (*Wen*).\nFollowing Heaven’s death to punish death,\nThis is called **martial virtue** (*Wu*).\nWhen culture and martial virtue are both practiced,\nThen the realm will submit.\n\nThe foundation of humanity is in the earth,\nThe foundation of the earth is in its suitability,\nSuitability’s life is in timing,\nTiming’s use is in the people,\nThe people’s use is in their strength,\nAnd strength’s use is in restraint.\n\nKnowing the earth’s suitability,\nPlanting must await the season—\nThen wealth arises.\nTaxes and levies with measure,\nThen the people will be rich,\nAnd rich people will have shame—\nWith shame, decrees become customs,\nAnd punishments are not imposed.\nWhen decrees become customs\nAnd punishments are not imposed,\nThen the realm is steadied—\nThe way of defense and victory in battle.\n\nLaw and measure are the pinnacle of governance.\nTo rule with law and measure,\nThe realm cannot be disordered.\nTo generate law and measure,\nThe realm cannot be disordered—\nWith impartial public service and trustworthy rewards and punishments,\nThis is the way of ruling.\n\nHarsh governance,\nRestraint in levies,\nDo not take the people’s time—\nThen the realm is secure.\nWithout the father’s conduct,\nThe son’s use is lost.\nWithout the mother’s virtue,\nThe people’s strength cannot be fully harnessed.\nWhen the father and mother’s conduct are complete,\nThen Heaven and Earth’s virtue is realized.\nWhen the three are complete,\nThen governance is achieved.\n\nTo gather the realm’s bold and valiant warriors,\nThen the realm’s defenses are complete.\nTo discern the Dao of culture and martial virtue,\nThen the realm’s guests will submit.\nWhen decrees accord with the people’s hearts,\nThen the people will obey.\nWhen love is comprehensive and without favor,\nThen the people will be close to their lord.\n\nThe ruler’s uprightness:\nTo observe a realm, observe its lord,\nTo observe a family, observe its father.\nTo be able for the realm is to be able for its lord,\nTo be able for the family is to be able for its father.\n\nIn observing realms, there are six *inversions*:\nWhen the son acts as father,\nWhen the minister acts as lord,\nThough strong and great, it will not be a realm.\n\nWhen [the ruler’s] counselors and ministers are outside in positions,\nThen the realm is not secure,\nAnd the lord does not govern—\nThen the ancestral altars will be ruined.\nWhen the lord loses his position,\nThen the realm has no foundation,\nAnd when ministers lose their place,\nThen the lower ranks have roots—\nThe realm will endure in worry.\n\nWhen the lord loses his position,\nThen the realm will be ruined.\nWhen ministers lose their place,\nThen decrees will not be carried out—\nThis is called *rootless realm*.\n\nWhen the lord is divided,\nThen he will lose clarity—\nMen and women will vie for authority,\nAnd the realm will have rebellious soldiers—\nThis is called *ruined realm*.\n\nWhen the legitimate son acts as father,\nThis is called **excessive expenditure** (*Shangri fei*).\nWhen ministers’ resolve is separate,\nAnd great ministers act as lords,\nThis is called **blocked and choked** (*Yongse*).\nIn strong realms, they are diminished,\nIn medium realms, they are broken,\nIn small realms, they are destroyed.\n\nWhen counselors and ministers are outside in positions,\nThis is called **reversed success** (*Niceng*).\nIn strong realms, they are endangered,\nIn medium realms, they are diminished,\nIn small realms, they are broken.\n\nWhen the lord loses his position,\nAnd ministers do not lose their place,\nThis is called **external roots** (*Waigen*).\nThe realm will be near to calamity—\nIn strong realms, they are worried,\nIn medium realms, they are endangered,\nIn small realms, they are diminished.\n\nWhen the lord loses his position,\nAnd ministers lose their place,\nThis is called **without foundation** (*Wuben*).\nThe ruler and people have no roots—\nThe realm will suffer great loss;\nIn strong realms, they are broken,\nIn medium realms, they are destroyed,\nIn small realms, they are annihilated.\n\nWhen the lord is violent and ministers are in rebellion,\nThis is called **great ruin** (*Dahuang*).\nExternal and internal armies,\nHeaven will bring calamity—\nNo realm, great or small, will escape annihilation.\n\nWhen the lord is divided,\nMen and women split authority,\nThis is called **great delusion** (*Dami*).\nThe realm will have its own armies—\nIn strong realms, they are broken,\nIn medium realms, they are destroyed,\nIn small realms, they are annihilated.\n\nIn observing realms, there are six *great rectitudes*:\nWhen the lord does not lose his position,\nThen the realm [is secure].\nWhen ministers lose their place,\nThen the lower ranks have no roots—\nThe realm will endure in worry.\n\nWhen the lord is virtuous and ministers loyal,\nThen the realm is secure.\n\nWhen the lord is lordly and ministers ministerial,\nAnd there is no obstruction between high and low,\nThen the realm is strong.\n\nWhen the lord holds the Dao and ministers follow principle,\nThen the realm flourishes as a **Hegemonic** power.\n\nWhen the lord is worthy and ministers gather like spokes to a hub,\nThen it is **Sovereign**.\n\nThe six rectitudes and six inversions determine the realm’s survival or ruin.\n\nThe lord above holds the six divisions to grant life and death,\nTo bestow rewards and punishments,\nAnd to wage decisive campaigns.\nWhen the world is at great peace,\nHe governs with clear virtue,\nAligning with Heaven and Earth,\nAnd universally covering all without favor—\nThus he rules the world.\n\nThe Way of ruling the world\nHas Heaven in it,\nHas humanity in it,\nAnd has Earth in it.\nThe three harmonized in use,\nAnd thus one holds the world.\n\nAs a ruler, he faces south and takes his place.\nMinisters stand in solemn reverence,\nDaring not to obscure their lord.\nThe people below align in order,\nDaring not to obscure their superiors.\nAll the people are harmonized and unified,\nAnd willingly serve their lord—\nWith vast lands, abundant people, and strong armies,\nNo enemy in the world can stand against them.\n\nCultivating cultural virtue to its utmost\nAnd wielding sharp blades with precision—\nThis is the foundation of Sovereignty.\nYet if one does not know the **Art of Sovereignty**,\nOne cannot rule the world.\n\nThose who know the **Art of Sovereignty**\nHunt and ride without reckless excess,\nRevel in food and joy without dissipation,\nAnd indulge in pleasures without confusion—\nYet when they engage the world in war,\nTheir expenditures are few while their victories are great.\n\nIf one does not know the **Art of Sovereignty**,\nHunting and riding lead to reckless excess,\nFeasting and joy lead to dissipation,\nIndulgence in pleasures leads to confusion—\nAnd when they engage the world in war,\nTheir expenditures are great while their victories are few.\nThey may win battles but cannot enforce their commands,\nTheir armies are exhausted and empty,\nAnd the people suffer ruin.\nThe sage does not tolerate this,\nNor does the world submit to it.\nThus, if one cannot also honor the worthy and take the Dao as teacher,\nThe people will abandon the realm.\n\nThe Sovereign who rules the world possesses **mysterious virtue**,\nAnd **hidden** [qualities]—\nOnly he knows how he does it,\nYet the world does not comprehend his method.\n\nThe Sovereign who rules the world\nLightly regards counties and states but honors the worthy,\nThus the realm is honored and his person secure;\nHe devalues wealth but prizes wisdom,\nThus his achievements are attained while his resources grow,\nHe devalues his own person but prizes the Dao,\nThus his person is honored and his commands obeyed.\nThe world follows him as its model.\n\nThe **Hegemonic** lord accumulates armored soldiers\nAnd wages campaigns without exhausting them,\nPunishing crimes according to law without privatizing their gains.\nThus his commands reach the world and none dare disobey.\n\nFrom this point downward,\nArmies contend in single combat,\nAnd ruin comes without warning—\nYet none know its origin.\n\nSpeaking of **Hegemony** and **Sovereignty**,\nOnly the Sovereign can universally cover all things,\nBending them to his will.\n\nThe six divisions:\nIf the lord and ministers improperly occupy their stations—\nThis is called **inversion**.\nIf the worthy are not in their proper places—\nThis is called **disorder in station**.\nIf actions are untimely—\nThis is called **inversion**.\nIf life and death are unjust—\nThis is called **tyranny**.\n\nInversion leads to losing one’s foundation,\nDisorder leads to losing one’s duties,\nUntimeliness leads to losing Heaven’s favor,\nTyranny leads to losing the people’s support.\nLosing one’s foundation brings ruin,\nLosing one’s duties brings encroachment,\nLosing Heaven’s favor brings famine,\nLosing the people’s support brings disease.\nThe shifts of Heaven and Earth pause in response.\nHeaven’s Way is not distant—\nEntering and dwelling within,\nExiting and returning without.\n\nWhen the lord and minister occupy their proper stations—\nThis is called **stability**.\nWhen the worthy occupy their proper stations—\nThis is called **rectitude**.\nWhen actions align with Heaven and Earth—\nThis is called **cultural harmony**.\nWhen punishments are timely—\nThis is called **military might**.\n\nStability brings security,\nRectitude brings governance.\nCultural harmony brings clarity,\nMilitary might brings strength.\nSecurity preserves the foundation,\nGovernance secures the people,\nClarity secures Heaven’s favor,\nStrength secures the enforcement of commands.\nHarmonized with Heaven and Earth,\nUnified with the people’s hearts—\nCultural and military virtues established,\nThis is called **Supreme Unity**.\n\nKnowing the four principles thoroughly,\nOne can settle the world,\nCan secure a single realm.\nIf governance is correct within but inverted without,\nSuccess comes with injury.\nIf governance is inverted within but correct without,\nSuccess comes with ruin.\nIf both within and without are inverted,\nThis is called **double calamity**—\nThe person is in danger of execution,\nThe realm is in danger of destruction.\n\nIf both within and without are correct,\nThis is called **Heaven’s mandate**—\nSuccess is achieved without exhaustion,\nAnd future generations will not encounter calamity.\n\n[When one] cultivates reputation and splendor,\nThis is for practical use.\n\nThe correct is movement,\nThe rectified is the root of affairs.\nHolding to the Dao and following principle,\nOne must begin with the foundation,\nThe correct as the framework,\nPunishments and campaigns must be just—\nIn accordance with Heaven’s principles.\nIf one exceeds the limits, one is constrained,\nIf one overreaches in punishment, one causes harm.\n\nIf one **transgresses** and **inverts** what is proper,\nEven if there are affairs to attend to,\nThere will be no success,\nNor will Heaven’s calamity be avoided.\n\nDo not **transgress**,\nDo not use death to preserve life,\nDo not create empty reputations.\nWhen reputation exceeds reality,\nThis is called **destroying one’s name**.\n\nTo extreme **yang** with killing,\nTo extreme **yin** with nurturing—\nThis is called **inverting the commands of yin and yang**.\nTo extreme **yang** in killing without,\nTo extreme **yin** in nurturing within—\nAlready inverting yin and yang,\nAnd again inverting one’s station—\nThe great result is the ruin of the realm,\nThe small result is personal calamity.\n\n[When one] reaches the limits of **yang** and **yin**,\nLife and death are established.\nThe appropriate has its measure,\nExcess returns to its opposite,\nFlourishing turns to decline—\nThis is the Way of Heaven and Earth,\nThis is human **principle**.\n\nThe Way that opposes and follows is the same, yet their principles differ.\nTo discern opposition and submission is called **understanding the Way’s governance**.\n\nBy making the strong submit to the weak, what realm cannot be conquered?\nBy making the noble submit to the base, who cannot be subdued?\nBy making the virtuous submit to the unworthy—\nThis is called **unjust governance**.\n\nWithin the **round** are the **round rules**,\nWithin the **square** are the **square rules**;\nBelow the **level** is called **upright**,\nAbove the **water** is called **even**;\nThe measure of inches and feet is called **small and great, short and long**.\n\nThe balance of **weights and measures** is called **unerring light and heavy**,\nThe **bushel and stone** have their fixed numbers,\nThe **Eight Standards**—\nThese are the **criteria of Heaven**.\n\nThe appointed times of the sun, moon, stars, and constellations,\nThe **Four Seasons’ measures**,\nThe **establishment of cardinal directions**,\nThe **distinction of inner and outer**—\nThese are the **criteria of Heaven**.\n\nLow does not **obscure** its **form**,\nUgly does not **conceal** its **sentiment**—\nThese are the **criteria of Earth**.\n\nThe ruler and subjects do not lose their **positions**,\nThe **scholar-officials** do not lose their **roles**,\nAssigning talents without **overstepping** their strengths,\nRemoving private interests to **establish the public**—\nThese are the **criteria of humanity**.\n\nUgly **sentiment** has a **name**,\nOpposition and submission have their **forms**,\n**Sentiment** is what constitutes **reality**;\nKings and lords **hold the Six Standards** to govern the realm as **upright**.\n\nFollowing the **Heavenly seasons**,\nAttacking the **Heavenly punishments**—\nThis is called **martial governance**.\n\n**Martial governance** leads,\nAnd **cultural governance** follows—\nThen success will be achieved.\n\nOne who uses **two cultural and one martial** is a **king**,\nHis **Way** departs from human **principle**,\nHe stands in the **position of delusion** yet does not **enlighten** himself—\nHis **reputation** will surely meet **punishment**.\n\nThe **gentle and weak** incur no **fault** yet are near,\nThey are not **reached** yet **ascend**—\nThis is called **gentle and weak**.\n\n**Upright** yet **unsteady**,\n**Name** and **reality** not **harmonized**—\nThis is called **losing the Way**,\nAnd its end will surely bring **personal calamity**.\n\nHoarded **gold and jade**,\nAccumulated **treasures**—\nThese are the **roots of resentment**.\n\n**Female music** and **luxurious delights**,\n**Burning materials** for **play**—\nThese are the **foundations of chaos**.\n\nNurturing the **roots of resentment**,\nFostering the **foundations of chaos**—\nEven with **sages**, they cannot **plan** against it.\n\nThe **Four Standards** of a sovereign—\nThese are the **extremes of Heaven and Earth**,\nThe source from which **commands** arise,\nThe **governance** of the **Way**.\n\nTo not **revere Heaven** is to lose its **spirit**,\nTo not **honor Earth** is to lose its **foundation**,\nTo not follow the **Four Seasons’ measures** is to make the people **suffer**.\n\nTo not **distinguish inner and outer positions**,\nTo not **respond to changes of motion and stillness**—\nThen affairs are **constrained within**,\nAnd actions are **constrained without**.\n\n**All Eight Standards** are lost.\n**Revering Heaven** and **honoring Earth**,\nThen one **secures its foundation**.\n\nFollowing the **Four Seasons’ measures**,\n**Adjusting motion and stillness**,\nThen the people **cease their suffering**,\n**Affairs prosper within**,\nAnd **actions prosper without**.\n\nIf **all Eight Standards** are not lost,\nThen one **harmonizes with Heaven and Earth**.\n\nHeaven **holds One** to **clarify Three**,\nEstablishes the **Eight Standards**,\nPractices the **Seven Laws**—\nThen within its **governance**, nothing is **unregulated**.\n\n**Branched movement** and **breathing**,\n**Flapping** and **flying**—\n**Not losing its constancy**—\nThis is the **Way of Heaven**.\n\nEarth **holds One** to **clarify Three**.\nThe sun **trusts** and **is trusted**,\nRising and setting have their **limits**—\nThis is the **measure of Heaven**.\nThe moon **trusts** and **is trusted**,\nBirth and death, advance and retreat, have their **constancy**—\nThis is the **numerical principle of Heaven**.\nThe stars are **arranged** with their **numbers**,\nYet do not lose their **paths**—\nThis is the **principle of trust in Heaven**.\n\nHeaven **clarifies Three** to **define Two**,\nThen **one day is dark, one day is bright**;\nHeaven **defines Two** to **establish Eight Standards**,\nThen the **Four Seasons** have their **measures**,\n**Motion and stillness** have their **positions**,\nAnd **inner and outer** have their **distinctions**.\n\nHeaven **establishes** the **Three Clarifications** and **Two Definitions** to **upright**—\nThis is the **Way of Heaven**.\n\nThe **suitable**—\nThis is the **measure of Heaven**.\nThe **trustworthy**—\nThis is the **appointed time of Heaven**.\nThe **constant**—\nThis is the **nature of Heaven**,\nThe **necessary**—\nThis is the **command of Heaven**.\n**All that is unregulated**—\nThis is how Heaven **gives life and death**.\n\nThis is called the **Seven Laws**.\nThe **Seven Laws**, each **according to its name**,\nThis is called **harmony**.\n**Harmony**—each **according to its principle**—\nThis is called **regulation**.\nWhere **regulation** exists,\nThis is called **order**.\n**Harmony** that does not **align with the Way**,\nThis is called **losing principle**.\nWhere **losing principle** exists,\nThis is called **inversion**.\n**Inversion** and **submission** each have their **commands**—\nThen **survival and ruin, rise and fall** can be known.\n\n**Upright** yet **unsteady**,\n**Name** and **reality** not **harmonized**—\nThis is called **losing the Way**,\nAnd its end will surely bring **personal calamity**.\n\nHoarded **gold and jade**,\nAccumulated **treasures**—\nThese are the **roots of resentment**.\n\n**Female music** and **luxurious delights**,\n**Burning materials** for **play**—\nThese are the **foundations of chaos**.\n\nNurturing the **roots of resentment**,\nFostering the **foundations of chaos**—\nEven with **sages**, they cannot **plan** against it.\n\nThe **Four Standards** of a sovereign—\nThese are the **extremes of Heaven and Earth**,\nThe source from which **commands** arise,\nThe **governance** of the **Way**.\n\nTo not **revere Heaven** is to lose its **spirit**,\nTo not **honor Earth** is to lose its **foundation**,\nTo not follow the **Four Seasons’ measures** is to make the people **suffer**.\n\nTo not **distinguish inner and outer positions**,\nTo not **respond to changes of motion and stillness**—\nThen affairs are **constrained within**,\nAnd actions are **constrained without**.\n\n**All Eight Standards** are lost.\n**Revering Heaven** and **honoring Earth**,\nThen one **secures its foundation**.\n\nFollowing the **Four Seasons’ measures**,\n**Adjusting motion and stillness**,\nThen the people **cease their suffering**,\n**Affairs prosper within**,\nAnd **actions prosper without**.\n\nIf **all Eight Standards** are not lost,\nThen one **harmonizes with Heaven and Earth**.\n\n**Upright** yet **unsteady**,\n**Name** and **reality** not **harmonized**—\nThis is called **losing the Way**,\nAnd its end will surely bring **personal calamity**.\n\n**Gentle and weak**—\n**Name** and **reality** not **harmonized**—\nThis is called **losing the Way**,\nAnd its end will surely bring **personal calamity**.\n\n**Hoarded gold and jade**,\n**Accumulated treasures**—\nThese are the **roots of resentment**.\n\n**Female music** and **luxurious delights**,\n**Burning materials** for **play**—\nThese are the **foundations of chaos**.\n\nNurturing the **roots of resentment**,\nFostering the **foundations of chaos**—\nEven with **sages**, they cannot **plan** against it.\n\nThe **Six Standards**—\nThe first is called **Observation**,\nThe second is called **Discourse**,\nThe third is called **Action**,\nThe fourth is called **Transformation**,\nThe fifth is called **Change**,\nThe sixth is called **Cultivation**.\n\n**Observation** reveals the **realms of life and death**,\n**Discourse** reveals the **sites of survival and ruin, rise and fall**,\n**Action** can **break the strong and elevate the weak**,\n**Transformation** does not **lose the taboo of right and wrong**,\n**Change** attacks **death** and nurtures **life**,\n**Cultivation** can **clarify virtue** and **remove harm**.\n\nIf the **Six Standards** are **complete**, then one is a **king**.\n\nThe **Three Names**—\nAlso called **Correct Naming**—\nThe first is **established yet still**,\nThe second is **leaning on names and laws yet causing chaos**,\nThe third is **the strong lord is extinguished without a name**.\n\nThe **Three Names** discerned, then affairs respond accordingly.\n\nWhen **action and stillness** are untimely,\nplanting trees in unsuitable lands—\nthe **Dao of the land** is inverted.\n\nWhen ministers do not serve the sovereign,\nthe commoners do not serve their superiors,\nand the clans do not attend to their duties—\nthen the **internal governance** is inverted.\n\nWhere inversion lies,\nit is called a **dead realm**—attack it.\nWhere reversal lies,\nit is called a **living realm**—nurture it.\nWhen inversion and compliance are regulated,\nthen **deception and pretense** are exposed.\n\nThe **substantial** appear **empty** to others,\nwhile the **insufficient** appear **abundant**.\nIf you act based on their **undertakings**, the world will obey.\nIf you govern based on their **inaction**, the world will be at peace.\nWhen **names and realities** correspond, there is **order**;\nwhen **names and realities** correspond, there is **tranquility**.\n\nThings **self-regulate**,\nnames **self-define**,\naffairs **self-determine**.\n\nWhen the **Three Names** are discerned,\nthen all **deception and pretense** are known without confusion.\n\nA realm about to flourish—\nits crimes will precede its ruin.\nDiscourse on those who violate prohibitions and disrupt **dharma**—\n**heaven’s punishment** will surely arrive.\n\nA realm possessing all **six dangers** will perish.\nA realm possessing the **three injustices** will die.\nOne who abolishes decrees will perish.\nA sovereign possessing the **three obstructions**—\nhis lands will be lost, his throne overthrown.\n\nA realm possessing the **three calamities**—\ndisaster will return upon itself.\n\nThe **overindulgent** die,\nthe **excessively frugal** are punished.\nThose with **vast virtue** but **shallow deeds** will collapse,\nthose with **prohibited names** but no **sovereign virtue** will die.\n\n**Ignoring profit**, **transmitting treachery**, **propagating punishments**—\nthese are the **chiefs of chaos**, the **mediators of grievance**;\nthese five bring disaster that returns upon themselves.\n\nTo **guard a realm** while relying on other **fortresses** is to be **diminished**,\nto **use a realm** while relying on its **strength** is to **weaken it**.\nTo raise armies without **principle**, to strike where unjust—\n**heaven’s calamities** will descend twice.\nTo complete an **inverted decree**—this is called **obtaining heaven’s favor**.\nIf an **inverted decree** succeeds,\nheaven will not fulfill its mandate but will **intensify its punishments**.\n\n**Excessive indulgence** brings no peace,\n**actions** are not upright.\n**Excessive indulgence** without peace,\n**actions** not upright—\nthis is called **later doom**.\n\nMass slaughter of the people,\nslaying captives,\npunishing the innocent—\nall disasters return upon themselves.\n\nIf those struck are **guilty**, their calamity is **fivefold**.\nIf those struck are **innocent**, their calamity is **tenfold**.\n\nA realm receiving arms but not knowing to **fortify its defenses**,\nnot **deflecting constant threats** to secure its borders,\n**rescuing others yet failing to preserve them**,\ninstead becoming a **gateway for disaster**—\nthis is called the **root of peril**.\n\n**Empty words, meager substance**—\na **perilous realm** loses its lands.\n\nThe **Great Earthworks** of Xia—\nthis was called **severing dharma**.\nViolating prohibitions and severing dharma—\n**heaven’s punishment** will surely arrive.\n\n**Six Dangers**:\nThe first is the **legitimate father**.\nThe second is the **great minister as sovereign**.\nThe third is the **counselor** who **betrays his intent**.\n\n「Fourth is **heeding the discarded and the established** by the feudal lords. ⑤\nFifth is **favoring ministers** who **obstruct and block** the Way. ⑥\nSixth is **father and elder brothers forming factions** to **undermine the sovereign**.\n\nWhen peril is not overcome, calamity befalls the self.\n\n**(Three) Unjust Acts**:\n① **Slaying the virtuous**,\n② **Slaying those who serve the realm**,\n③ **Punishing the innocent**.\n\nThese are the **three unjust acts**.\n\n**(Three) Obstructions**:\nIf one **elevates a rival within** the court, it is called **blocking** (塞).\nIf one **elevates a rival without** the court, it is called **undermining**.\nIf both inner and outer rivals are elevated, the sovereign becomes **isolated and upright**.\n\nWith this, a realm may stand, yet its defenses are not steadfast, and its battles are not victorious.\nThis is called the **first obstruction**.\n\nFrom within, to **deceive** the outside is called **the second obstruction**.\nFrom without, to **deceive** the inside is called **the third obstruction**.\nWhen inner and outer deceptions ensue, contention arises, and the realm’s capital is imperiled.\nThis is called the **second obstruction**.\n\nOne man **monopolizing authority** is called **obscuring the light**.\n\nFrom within, to **deceive** both inner and outer courts is called **double obstruction**.\n\nWhen inner and outer courts act as one,\nthe realm **shifts its allegiance**.\nThis is called the **third obstruction**.\n\n**(Three) Evils**:\n① **Loving cruel weapons**,\n② **Practicing perverse virtue**,\n③ **Indulging destructive desires**.\n\nThese are called **(the three) evils**.\n\n**Obscuring the Way’s benefits** brings **heaven’s calamities**.\n**Obscuring a single realm’s benefits** brings **that realm’s disasters**.\n\n**Binding with oaths yet betraying** is called **the treacherous transmission**.\n\n**Striking those guilty** yet **reaping harm in return** is called **exposing the benefits**.\n**Slaying father and elder brothers above**, **driving children and younger siblings below** is called **chaos at the head**.\n\n**External oaths lacking trust** are called **the grievous mediators**.\n\nWhen a realm is on the verge of ruin,\nit should **first flourish in culture** before descending into force.\n**The Dao of heaven and earth** is thus.\n\nThe **four seasons follow their measure**—\nthis is the **principle of heaven and earth**.\nThe **sun, moon, and stars** follow their **numbers**—\nthis is the **order of heaven and earth**.\n**Three seasons of success**, one season of punishment and slaughter—\nthis is the **Dao of heaven and earth**.\nThe **four seasons** follow their **fixed course**, neither **erring nor deviating**, with **constant laws and patterns**—\n**the Way of heaven and earth**.\n\n**One established**, one discarded;\n**one born**, one slain—\nthe **four seasons** follow their **proper sequence**,\nand **end only to begin anew**.\nThis is the **principle of affairs**; **obedience and defiance determine their outcome**.\n\nWhen **labors overflow into heaven**, there is **capital punishment**.\nWhen **labors do not reach heaven**, they **retreat without merit**.\nWhen **labors align with heaven**, achievement is **greatly accomplished**—\nthis is the **principle of affairs**.\n\n**Obedience brings life**, **principle brings success**,\n**defiance brings death**, **and failure brings ruin**.\n**Betraying heaven’s Dao**, the realm **lacks a sovereign**.\nA realm **without a sovereign** is **assailed by both obedience and defiance**.\n\n**Striking the root and undermining the foundation**,\n**chaos arises and the realm falls**.\nIf one **gains the Way of heaven** yet **abandons the land** to change rulers,\n**not following heaven’s constancy** and **not moderating the people’s strength**,\n**migration and displacement yield no fruit**.\n**Nurturing the dead and striking the living** is called **perverse completion**.\nIf **no one is slain by human hands**, **heaven’s punishment will surely come**.\n**Perverse measures begin to take root**—\n**beware of not upholding the proper sequence**, for **calamity will then claim you**.\n\nThus, those who **hold fast to the Dao** and **observe the world** must **carefully examine the origins of affairs**,\n**scrutinize their punishments and names**.\nOnce **punishments and names are fixed**,\n**obedience and defiance have their place**,\n**death and life are determined**,\n**survival and ruin, rise and fall** are settled.\nThen, **comparing with the constant Dao of heaven and earth**,\none may **determine the location of calamity and blessing, death and life, survival and ruin, rise and fall**.\n\nTherefore, **all actions are without error**,\nand **discourses on the world** leave **no strategy unconsidered**.\nThus, one **can establish the Son of Heaven** and **appoint the Three Exalted Ones**,\nand **the world will transform**—\nthis is called **having the Dao**.\n\n**Discourses on the Dao** are the **source of divine wisdom**.\n**Divine wisdom** abides within the **measure** yet **manifests beyond it**.\nAbiding within the **measure**,\nit **requires no words yet is trusted**.\nManifesting beyond the **measure**,\nits words **cannot be altered**.\n\nAbiding within the **measure**,\nit is **still and unmoved**.\nManifesting beyond the **measure**,\nits actions **are dynamic yet cannot be transformed**.\n\n**Dynamic yet still, unmoved,**\n**moving yet untransformed**—\nthus it is called **divine**.\n\n**Divine wisdom** is the **verification of insight**.\nThere is **a thing that begins to form**;\n**founded upon earth yet overflowing into heaven**,\nits **shape is unseen**—\n**greatly complete**, it **endures between heaven and earth** yet **its name is unknown**.\n**None can perceive its wisdom**, so **perverse completion** occurs.\n\n**Things arise from below**—\nthus there is **perverse punishment**, and **calamity befalls the self**.\n**Nurturing what leads to death**, **striking what leads to life**,\n**striking the root and severing kinship**, **striking what flourishes and abandoning its foundation**—\n**chaos will surely follow**, ending in **nameless ruin**.\n\n**Like a blazing fire**, **like a final end**—\nthis is the **reverse of affairs**.\n**Like a leader’s arrogance**, **like a subject’s insolence**—\nthis is the **reverse of life**.\n\nAll **ten thousand things and wealth**,\n**growing yet not enduring**,\ntheir **death is certain**.\nThese **three evils** all **stir beyond the measure** yet **seek completion**.\n**Completion will not be achieved**, and **calamity will surely return**.\n\n**Using flexibility as rigidity** leads to **lifeless stagnation**,\n**using rigidity as flexibility** leads to **destruction**.\n**Overemphasizing flexibility brings fortune**,\n**overemphasizing rigidity brings annihilation**.\n\n**\"Yes\" and \"No\"**—\n**\"Yes\" is the seal of words**, **\"No\" is their termination**.\nIf **\"No\" follows \"Yes\" without trust**, **wisdom is greatly confused**.\nIf **\"No\" follows \"Yes\" with certainty**, it **abides within the measure**.\nWhen **affairs arise in the world**, one must **carefully examine their names**.\nIf **names are examined and principles followed**,\n**this is surely blessing**, **not surely disaster**—\n**right and wrong are divided**, and **judgment is made by law**.\n\n**Virtuous stillness and careful listening**,\n**using law as the seal**.\n**Scrutinizing names and principles from beginning to end**—\nthis is called **examining principles**.\n\nOnly the **public** is without **private interests**.」\n\nWhen one sees **Dao/Way** without confusion,\nThen one knows to **arise with vigor**.\n\nThus, those who **hold fast to the Dao** observe the world:\nThey see the **right Way** following its **principles**,\nThey can **uphold** what is **crooked and straight**,\nThey can **uphold** what is **beginning and end**.\n\nThus they can **scrutinize names and principles**.\n**Form and name** emerge with sound,\n**Sound and reality** harmonize in resonance—\n**disaster** is **abolished**, **blessing** is **established**.\n\nLike **shadows** that **follow** **forms**,\nLike **echoes** that **follow** **sounds**,\nLike **scales** that do not **conceal** heavy and light—\nThus only those who **hold fast to the Dao** can be **virtuous stillness and impartial correctness**,\nAnd then **see truth**, and then **obtain the sincerity of names and principles**.\n\nWhen **chaos** accumulates within yet **claims correctness** without—**annihilation**.\nWhen **punishment** is **fully formed** yet **upholding is lost** without—**extinction**.\nWhen one **goes against** the **overflowing** **high** yet does not know to **halt**—**annihilation**.\n\nWhen a **nation** **acts in succession** upon **emptiness**,\nIf its **affairs** **do not succeed**,\nThis is called **finding Heaven**,\nIf its **affairs** **truly succeed**,\nThen **body and mind** are **nameless**.\n\n**Overemphasizing opposition** and **principles**,\n**Guarding the Dao** is **conduct**,\n**Nation in peril** has **disaster**.\nWhen **two oppositions** **mutually attack**,\n**Mutually bringing disaster**,\n**Nations** all face **peril and annihilation**.\n\n**Names and principles** through **law**—five thousand in total,\nTen **great laws**.\n\nIn days of old, the Yellow Sovereign first took delight in sincerity,\nAnd fashioned a self-representing **symbol**—square in form,\nWith a single **heart** attached, extending in four directions from its center,\nFront and back aligned, left and right aligned,\nStanding firm upon its **position** with measured steps.\nThus, he became the **sovereign** for all under Heaven.\n\nI received my mandate from Heaven,\nEstablished my **position** upon Earth,\nAnd earned my **name** among the people.\nOnly I, alone, am **paired** with Heaven,\nAnd thus I set up the Three Kings and Three Ministers.\nI established nations and placed rulers over the Three Ministers.\nCounting days, marking months, calculating years,\nTo align with the movements of sun and moon.\n\nThe Earth is vast and abundant—\nI emulate Heaven’s great luminosity.\nI revere Heaven, cherish Earth, and love the people.\nWithout mandate, I grasp **emptiness** and hold to sincerity.\nI revere Heaven, cherish Earth, and love the people,\nAnd establish mandate, grasping **emptiness** and holding to sincerity.\nI love the people, and the people do not perish;\nI love the Earth, and the Earth does not lie barren.\nI receive the people’s [unclear]—\n[unclear]—until death.\nMy **position** is [unclear].\nIf I can but love the near and promote the worthy,\nI shall not be abandoned, and my virtue will reach its height.\n\nI obey Heaven’s command and follow the **Yellow Sovereign’s** decree,\nAs **Lìhé** [力黑] conceals himself and wanders through the four nations,\nObserving the enduring and virtuous ways.\n**Lìhé** demonstrates the **symbol**—\nWhen he sees black, it is black;\nWhen he sees white, it is white.\nWhen the Earth [unclear]—\nIf the people are evil, he acts with caution;\nIf the people are still, he is still;\nIf the people act, he acts.\n**Lìhé**, having established measures and set the extremes,\nDeclared: *\"Heaven and Earth are complete,\nYet the people’s **conduct** is disordered—\nNo distinction between obedience and rebellion,\nNo virtue or punishment,\nNo stillness or action,\nNo order of precedence or **name**.\"*\n\nNow I wish to establish the **principles** of obedience and rebellion,\nTo set the proper times for stillness and action under Heaven,\nAnd thus record them—\nHow shall I proceed?\n\nThe Yellow Sovereign said:\n*\"All things were originally one,\nWithout obscurity or clarity,\nWithout yin or yang.\nYin and yang were not yet distinguished,\nAnd I had no **name** for them.\nNow I divide them into two—\nYin and yang.\nSeparating them into the **four seasons**—\n[unclear]—\nAnd thus establish them as constants.\nThe bright ones take this as **law**,\nAnd the **Dao** is followed subtly.\nFollowing the **law**, conforming to the **principles** of male and female,\nMale and female seeking each other,\nHard and soft meeting,\nSoft and hard completing each other—\nMale and female taking **form**.\nBelow, they unite with Earth;\nAbove, they unite with Heaven.\nObtaining Heaven’s subtlety,\nAt the time when [unclear]—\nWaiting for Earth’s **qi** to rise,\nThen germination begins to germinate,\nAnd growth to grow—\nHeaven completes it.\nWithout this, it does not succeed;\nWithout nurturing, it does not thrive.\n\nThe people, when born, seek only to eat and reproduce.\nIf they do not unite, they cannot reproduce;\nWithout food, they cannot sustain themselves on Earth.\nIf they do not eat, they cannot sustain themselves in Heaven.\nThus, the **abundance of yin** spreads virtue,\nAnd the **abundance of yang** fulfills the people’s labor—\nThis is how they are fed.\nThe **host of yang** refines its **form**,\nThe **heavy yin** [unclear]—\nNurturing the long night, sealing the Earth’s womb—\nThis is how they reproduce.\nWithout depletion or excess,\nBalancing them with **punishment** and **virtue**.\nSpring and summer are **virtue**,\nAutumn and winter are **punishment**.\nPrioritizing **virtue** over **punishment** to nurture life.\nOnce **names** are established,\nThe **opposing** give rise to contention.\nWithout **divination**, nothing is certain.\nThe extremes of **divination** lie in **punishment** and **virtue**.\n**Punishment** and **virtue** are grand—\nSun and moon face each other,\nIlluminating their due times,\nAnd neither overflows nor is deficient.\n\nThus, I make the people not **overreach**,\nEnsure actions are not **excessively scrutinized**,\nPrevent the Earth from being **over-exploited**—\nFor if it is over-exploited, the land grows barren;\nIf it is excessively scrutinized, it loses its luster.\n**Overreaching** leads to **martial law**.\n\nTherefore, as a **sovereign**,\nI must regulate the **Three Joys** in season,\nNot disrupt the people’s labor,\nNor defy the **Heavenly timing**.\nThen the five grains will ripen,\nAnd the people will flourish.\nRulers and ministers, above and below,\nWill harmonize in their aspirations.\nHeaven will complete this.\n\nThus, aligning with the **times** to nurture the people’s labor,\nPrioritizing **virtue** over **punishment**,\nConforming to Heaven—\nWhen the **times** are abundant yet affairs falter;\nWhen the **yin nodes** recur in sequence,\nAnd the Earth’s **abundance** withdraws.\nCorrecting **names**, refining **punishment**,\nThe **hibernating creatures** do not emerge,\nFrost and snow clear,\nThe **Meng** grains stand solemn—\nThis is when **disasters** arise.\nThus, if one acts, it will not succeed.\nWhen the **times** falter yet affairs are abundant,\nThe **yang nodes** recur in sequence;\nThe Earth’s **abundance** does not withdraw.\"\n\nThus, when **names** are corrected and **punishment** is relaxed,\nThe **hibernating creatures** stir and make their voices heard.\nGrasses and plants flourish once more.\n\nWhen **yang** follows **yang**, there is excess yet no radiance.\nIn such times, any action will fail to bear fruit.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** of Heaven is already complete,\nAnd the Earth’s **abundance** is now full.\nFlows disperse and coalesce—\nThis is the work of the **sage**.\n\nThe **sage** does not contrive,\nBut instead guards when the **times** reverse.\nHe cherishes the people through love,\nAnd aligns with Heaven’s **Dao/Way**.\n\nThe **sage** stands correct to **await** Heaven,\nAnd remains still to **await** the people.\nHe does not defy Heaven’s **punishment**,\nNor does he conceal or transmit **disasters**.\n\nWhen the **times** align, he acts with decisive resolve.\nWhen he should act yet does not, he invites chaos instead.\n\n**Observation:** The **Yellow Emperor** asked **Yan Ruan** [阉冉], saying:\n\"I wish to promulgate the five **administrations** [正],\nWhere should I begin and where should I end?\"\nHe replied:\n\"Begin with oneself.\nWithin, there are **correct measures** [正度];\nThen extend to the outer folk.\nInner and outer harmonize,\nAnd thus the **administrations** will take effect.\"\n\nThe **Yellow Emperor** said:\n\"I have already corrected and have already **awaited** [静],\nYet my realm grows ever more unsettled—\nWhat should I do?\"\nHe replied:\n\"First establish **correct measures** within,\nThen correct the outer folk—\nThe **administrations** will then be certain.\"\n\nWith **rules** [规] in his left hand,\nAnd **compass** [矩] in his right,\nWhat fear is there that all men and women will not be **transformed** [毕迥]?\nWhat fear is there for the realm?\nWhen the five **administrations** are promulgated,\nUse them to govern the five **clarities** [明].\n\nWith **rules** on the left and **rules** on the right,\n**Await** the rebellious forces.\n\nThe **Yellow Emperor** said:\n\"I do not yet know myself—\nHow should I proceed?\"\nHe replied:\n\"When one does not yet know oneself,\nThey must deeply **retreat** into the **depths** [渊],\nTo seek **internal punishments** [内刑].\nOnce **internal punishments** are obtained,\nThen they may know themselves and **yield** [屈].\nThe **Yellow Emperor** said:\n\"I wish to **yield** my body—\nHow should I **yield** it?\"\nHe replied:\n\"Those whose **Dao/Way** is the same share the same affairs;\nThose whose **Dao/Way** differs share different affairs.\nNow, the great affairs of the world,\nThe **times** have already arrived—\nIf you can **refrain** [慎勿争],\nThen there will be no **contention** [争].\"\nThe **Yellow Emperor** said:\n\"Do not act—what then?\"\nHe replied:\n\"**Anger** is the **blood** and **qi**;\n**Contention** is the **outer flesh** and **grease**.\nIf **anger** is not released,\nIt will **fester** [浸凛] and become **ulceration** [臃疽].\nIf you can **remove** the four **excesses** [四者],\nThen even **dried bones** will not **contend**.\"\n\nThus, the **Yellow Emperor** dismissed his **ministers** [国大夫],\nAscended **Bo Wang** [博望] Mountain,\nAnd **discussed** [谈] and **rested** [卧] for three years in self-cultivation.\n\n**Dan Cai** [单才] and **Yan Ruan** then ascended,\nAnd **aroused** [起] the **Yellow Emperor**, saying:\n\"It is sufficient now.\nTo **create contention** is **disastrous** [凶];\nNot to **contend** also means no **success**.\nWhy is it not sufficient?\"\n\nThe **Yellow Emperor** then **displayed** his **resounding axes** [锵钺],\nAnd **roused** his **defensive troops** [戌兵].\nHe **drummed** [提鼓] in his **cloak** [袍],\nTo **encounter** [遇] **Chu You** [之蚩尤],\nAnd thus **seized** [禽] him.\n\nThe **Emperor** **made a solemn vow** [箸盟],\nThe **vow** declared:\n\"To **reverse** **intentions** [反义] and **defy** **times** [逆时],\nTheir **punishment** shall be **encountered** [视] like **Chu You**.\nTo **reverse intentions** and **abandon** **the ancestral line** [倍宗],\nTheir **law** shall be **death** until **exhaustion** [穷].\nThe five **administrations**.\"\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said to **Fú** [辅]:\n*\"Only I remain alone, yet I hold all under Heaven.\nNow I wish to **nurture** and **rectify** it,\nTo **equalize** and **balance** it—\nHow shall I proceed?\"*\n\n**Gǔtóng** [果童] replied:\n*\"Without **risks**, it cannot be **balanced**;\nWithout **proper measures**, it cannot be **rectified**.\nObserve the **Dao/Way** above in Heaven,\nGaze upon the **patterns** below on Earth,\nAnd **examine** the **intercourse** of male and female.\n\nHeaven has its **principles** [干],\nEarth has its **constancies** [恒常].\nWhen **principles** and **constancies** **harmonize**,\nThus there is **obscurity** and **clarity**,\n**Yin** and **Yang**.\nEarth has **mountains** and **marshes**,\n**Black** and **white**,\n**Good** and **evil**.\nEarth **cultivates** its **virtue/power** through **stillness**,\nWhile Heaven **establishes** its **names** through **action**.\n**Stillness** and **action** **nourish** each other,\n**Virtue/power** and **tyranny** **complete** each other.\n\nWhen the **Two Forces** [阴阳] have their **names**,\nTheir **interaction** brings **completion**.\nWhen **Yin** and **Yang** are **complete**,\n**Transformation** and **change** then **arise**.\nThere are **heavy** and **light** **weights**,\nA **hundred** becomes **light** when **tasked**.\nHumans have their **centrality**,\nThings have their **forms**,\nAnd thus **completion** is achieved.\"\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said:\n*\"The people **rely** on Heaven to **generate**,\nAnd **depend** on Earth to **nourish**.\nThey take Heaven as **father**,\nAnd Earth as **mother**.\nNow I wish to **nurture** and **rectify** it,\nTo **equalize** and **balance** it—\nWho shall **suit** this **beginning?\"*\n\n**Yóushí** [由始] replied:\n*\"If **risks** are **obtained** and **balanced**,\nAnd **proper measures** are **established**—\nWhen **nobles** and **commoners** are **not** **properly measured**,\nAnd **poverty** and **wealth** are **not** **equalized**,\nThe **ancestral precedents** of past ages\nShall be **followed** by future generations,\nFrom **Gǔtóng** onward.\"\n\nThus **Gǔtóng** donned **rough hemp garments** and **pierced ears**,\nCarried a **plow** on his back and **humped** his shoulders.\nHe **wandered**, **cultivating qi** and **begging food**,\nCirculating through the **Four Realms**,\nTo **demonstrate** the **extremes** of **poverty** and **humiliation**.\n\n**Lìhēi** [力黑] then **asked** [问] **Yīnmóu** [阴谋] about **high treason**,\nAnd **Yīnmóu** **responded** to **Gāoyáng** [高阳] on how to proceed.\n**Tàishān Zhī** [太山之稽] said:\n*\"Do not **worry**, child.\nHeaven’s **movements** are **upright** and **trustworthy**;\nThe **sun** and **moon** do not **linger** in their courses,\nAnd **nature** does not **neglect** its **labors**,\nThus it **oversees** all under Heaven.\n\nHuman **life** has its **limits**,\nAnd when **desires** are **exhausted**,\n**Excess** becomes **harmful**,\n**Scarcity** becomes **destitution**,\n**Haste** becomes **ruin**,\n**Slackness** becomes **decay**,\n**Anxiety** becomes **distress**,\nAnd **indulgence** becomes **blame**.\n**Accumulation** leads to **height**,\nYet **falling** brings **no rescue**.\nWhen **orders** are given but **no repentance** is allowed,\nDo not **worry**,

the people **act** yet **amuse** themselves.\nI shall **cause** them to **exhaust** themselves.\n\n**Dānshèng Cái** [单盈才] said to **Tàishān Zhī**:\n*\"It is sufficient.\"*\nThus he **displayed** his

overturn and topple—\nI greatly fear this.\nWhat should be done?\"*\n\nLìhēi replied:\n*\"Do not worry, do not fear.\nHeaven’s decree is fixed as such.\nWhen Heaven and Earth are settled,\nAll strive and contend.\nThose who contend are doomed,\nYet those who do not contend also cannot succeed.\nThose who follow Heaven prosper,\nThose who defy Heaven perish.\nDo not defy Heaven’s Way,\nThen you will not lose your foundation.\n\nWhen Heaven and Earth are established,\nThe common people are born.\nClans are born and fixed,\nYet enemies arise early in contention.\nWhat is not examined will be determined—\nThe utmost of examination lies in punishments and virtue.\nPunishments and virtue are vast,\nLike the sun and moon facing each other,\nTo illuminate their rightness.\nWhen rightness is lost,\nLook around for its center.\nHeaven’s virtue is vast—\nWithout punishments, it cannot act.\nReverently observe Heaven’s punishments—\nWithout virtue, it must topple.\nPunishments and virtue nourish each other,\nThus success and failure are formed.\nWhen punishments are obscure, virtue shines;\nWhen punishments are hidden, virtue is bright;\nWhen punishments are faint, virtue prevails.\nLet the bright guide as law,\nAnd let the subtle Way be its punishment.\nBrightness reaching subtlety,\nTimes reverse to become opportunity.\n\nHeaven’s Way returns to humanity,\nBecoming their guest—\nWhen stillness aligns with virtue’s time,\nHeaven and Earth grant it.\nStillness does not decay,\nYet stillness and action are not the same—\nThe state remains undetermined.\nWhat should be done is not done,\nHeaven’s cycles turn around,\nAnd humanity becomes the guest again.\nWhen stillness and action meet the time,\nHeaven and Earth grant it.\nWhen stillness and action miss the time,\nHeaven and Earth take it away.\n\nThe Way of Heaven and Earth—\nCold and heat, dryness and moisture—\nCannot coexist.\nHard and soft, yin and yang—\nNaturally do not act together.\nThey nourish each other in turn,\nTheir actions follow names,\nTheir deeds seem easily accomplished—\nYet human affairs have no constancy.\nExceeding limits, losing rightness,\nChanging what is fixed—\nVirtue then has none.\n\nIn the past, punishments were misapplied.\nWhen settled, there were no laws;\nWhen acting, names were defied.\nThus, they suffered their punishments.\n\n**Clan Contention**\nThe Queen Mother Lǘmó observed\nThe constants of auspicious and inauspicious omens,\nTo distinguish the nodes of male and female,\nThus dividing the directions of calamity and blessing.\nArrogant and proud, haughty and insolent—\nThis is called the male node.\nRespectful and frugal—\nThis is called the female node.\nThe male node, when gained,\nIs not a blessing.\nThe female node, when lost,\nMust be rewarded.\nThe male node, when repeatedly gained,\nIs called accumulating calamity.\nHeavy misfortune and sorrow arrive,\nNearly to death.\nThe female node, when repeatedly lost,\nIs called accumulating virtue.\nCautious and vigilant, without law,\nGreat blessings will reach their peak.\n\nAs for these calamities and difficulties,\nThose who come first are always inauspicious,\nThose who come later are always auspicious.\nIf first and not inauspicious,\nIt is always because the female node remains.\nIf later and not auspicious,\nIt is always because the male node remains.\nIf first and not inauspicious,\nAnd later and not auspicious,\nIt is always because the female node remains.\nIf first and not auspicious,\nAnd later and not auspicious,\nIt is always because the male node remains.\n\nAll people prefer the male node—\nThis is called obstructing life.\nThe noble perish,\nThe base perish.\nTo guard without peace,\nTo act without success,\nTo seek without obtaining,\nTo fight without victory—\nTheir lives are not long,\nTheir descendants do not thrive.\nThis is called the calamitous node,\nThis is called scattering virtue.\n\nAll people prefer the female node—\nThis is called receiving blessings.\nThe rich prosper,\nThe poor thrive.\nTo guard is to be at peace,\nTo act is to succeed.\nTo seek is to obtain,\nTo fight is to triumph.\nTheir lives are long and flourishing—\nThis is called accumulating virtue.\nThus, those who accumulate virtue prosper,\nThose who accumulate calamity perish.\nObserve what they accumulate,\nAnd you know the direction of blessing and ruin.\n\n**The Nodes of Male and Female**\nIf arms do not conform to Heaven,\nArms cannot be moved.\nIf they do not follow Earth,\nArms cannot be placed.\nIf punishments and laws are not entered,\nArms cannot succeed.\n[Observe] the [cycles of] Heaven and Earth,\nHeaven and Earth shape it,\nThe Sage follows and completes it.\nThe Sage’s achievements,\nTime makes them ordinary.\nFollowing the time, grasping the [Way]—\nThere will surely be success.\nThe Sage does not reach punishments,\nDoes not conceal transmission,\nFollows Heaven’s time,\nAnd all is decided.\nIf decisive yet undecided,\nChaos will return.\nHeaven naturally takes and gives,\nHas omens—\nIf not received,\nCalamity follows.\nThree times the path is cut off,\nArms have no success.\nThree times the path is cut off,\nArms have success.\nIf not celebrating their victory,\nThey return to receive calamity.\nThe state has fortune—\nThe decisive suffer calamity.\nThe state has no fortune—\nYet their lives are prolonged,\n[Their days] bright and clear.\n\nUsing the people’s strength,\nDefying Heaven’s limits—\nAgain, with heavy achievements,\nTheir state becomes endangered,\nTheir ancestral altars are in peril,\nTheir undertakings fail,\nTheir celebrations do not celebrate their victories—\nThis is Heaven’s fixed Way and Earth’s.\n\n**The Conduct of Arms**\nThe Yellow Emperor asked Lìhēi:\n*\"I alone hold all under Heaven,\nYet cunning people will arise,\nUsing deceitful knowledge,\nUnlawful as ropes.\nI fear they may use this to disrupt all under Heaven.\nPlease ask: Is there a fixed method under Heaven\nThat can rectify the people?\"*\n\n「Lìhēi replied: *\"Indeed. In ancient times, when Heaven and Earth were formed, the Dao was established with its proper name, and the forms were harmonized to uphold a single principle. It was applied above to Heaven, and extended below to the Four Seas. I have heard that under Heaven there are fixed methods, hence it is said: 'Do not multiply words, for one statement suffices.' Follow the proper name and uphold unity, and the people will not disrupt their principles.\"*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said: *\"Is there still another Way under Heaven?\"*\nLìhēi replied: *\"Indeed. In ancient times, the August Heaven sent Feng to descend with a single statement that sufficed. The Five Emperors employed it to measure the harmony of Heaven and Earth, to gauge the Four Seas, to embrace the common people, and to rectify the worthies of the age. Thus, slanderous folk all withdrew, virtuous men arose universally, the Five Evils fled, and the age of flattery and sophistry came to an end. Follow the proper name and uphold unity, and the people will not disrupt their principles.\"*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said: *\"When you speak of 'unity,' is it merely unity, or does it also have its length?\"*\nLìhēi replied: *\"Unity is the root of the Dao—how could it lack its length? What is lost by all, none can uphold unity. The essence of unity is observed in Heaven and Earth; its principle is applied to the Four Seas. How does one know its full extent? Through the near and far, it is measured by never losing unity. With unity, one can govern the myriad; with little, one can know much. When gazing far across the Four Seas, and considering the utmost of high and low, all directions embrace their own Dao. Among myriad words, there is a root; among thousands, there is a key; among tens of thousands, there is a summary. Though myriad things abound, they all pass through a single gateway. He who is not upright yet seizes the ability to govern this—he is not upright. Only the virtuous can wield rectitude to rectify the strange, grasp unity to know the myriad, remove the people’s harms, and maintain what benefits them. Embracing unity and guarding the one, he aligns with the utmost limits of Heaven and Earth, thus understanding their blessings and calamities. Fixed methods that are not constant—Heaven forbids them. Disruptive undertakings—Earth forbids them. Those who lose their commands—sovereigns forbid them. When these three prohibitions are observed, the state is nearly secure. Earth’s prohibitions are: do not drain the high, do not increase the low, do not encroach upon rivers, do not defy the land, do not obstruct the people’s clarity. Advancing without yielding, standing without humility, trampling upon propriety—this is called great misfortune. In human affairs, rigidity and flexibility: rigidity alone is insufficient, and flexibility alone cannot be relied upon. The rigid yet fierce as a tiger perishes; the weak yet drowning in indulgence also perishes. Those who do not uphold ancient laws and proper institutions die; those who monopolize profit and cut short rituals to dwell in luxury are doomed to emptiness. The Dao of Heaven is constant, spread across the lower lands, applied to the Nine Regions. Thus, kings and nobles must be cautious in their commands, so the people know their proper course. Heaven has fixed days; the people follow them naturally. If they deviate, their lives are diminished, and they return to servitude—this is the Dao of Heaven.\"*\n\n**On Prohibitions**\n*\"All states that store arms possess military methods. The methods of warfare under Heaven are three: some wage war for profit, some for righteousness, and some for anger. Those who wage war for profit, seeing the people hungry and the state in disarray, with high and low out of place, raise arms to seize them—though they gain no great profit, they also cause no great harm. Those who wage war for righteousness, strike down disorder and suppress tyranny, elevate the virtuous and remove the unworthy—this is called righteousness. The aggressor, though, is the one whom the multitude will slay. Thus, to attack all under Heaven with a single state, or to conquer the world with a thousand-chariot lord—few begin this, and none can complete it, for their resolve is not constant, and they turn back when exhausted. Those who wage war in anger—though their hearts are filled with fury, they cannot merely rage. Anger must have purpose; success must not be sought for its own sake. If they begin with aggression, it is not the Dao. The Dao’s practice is without obstruction. Without obstruction, there is no exhaustion. Hence, the aggressor is doomed, and the prohibitor is the agent of order. Therefore, when advancing, do not linger in place.\"*\n\n**On the Foundation of Undertakings**\n*\"The wise act in accordance with Heaven and Earth, align with the people, and bring auspiciousness to spirits and ghosts. They make the people share in benefit, and all rely upon them—this is called righteousness. Their bodies bear the burdens at the forefront; their sovereigns employ them. They bring lasting benefit to the state’s ancestral altars, to the people of the age, and to myriad lineages. When the world’s name is renowned, yet they are not employed, it is in vain. He who gains benefit with a single word is a worthy scholar. He who gains benefit for the state with a single word is a state’s worthy scholar. Thus, the virtuous humble themselves to follow the Dao, use wisdom to discern it, strength to enact it, and cherish its harmony with the age. In times when flexibility is needed to await it, if kings and nobles know this, the state is fortunate. A great state with many people, though its burdens are borne at the rear, is also doomed to misfortune. Hence, the ruler does not rely on fortune to govern the state. To govern the state, there is the Way of the Foreground: to know Heaven’s times above, Earth’s advantages below, and human affairs within. To practice the harmony of yin and yang is to govern; to seize the strange is to bring disorder. Rectified names do not falter; strange names do not stand. The Dao, when upright, is without peril; it can be followed or begun. Thus, one may govern the myriad, one may govern the state. Governing the myriad, one achieves success; governing the state, one achieves peace. Small states gain it to defend their borders; great states gain it to unite and conquer all under Heaven. The Dao has its origin but no end; those who employ it prosper, those who do not merely observe. Following it brings beauty; adhering to it brings constancy. The ancient worthies practiced this Way. Knowing this Way, spirits and ghosts align with them, and so do Earth and Heaven, making them flourish in military and in state. The ancient worthies practiced this Way. The Way of the Foreground—Heaven has fixed days, Earth has fixed constants.\"*\n\nWith the people, share in their labors; with the spirits, share in their rites.\nArrogance and excess lead to strife, while dark schemes bring no auspice.\nSeverity in governance brings peril akin to death.\n\nTo take without giving—such a state shall surely perish.\nNear or far, its schemes will rise, and no bone shall stand against them.\nHeaven abhors height, Earth abhors vastness, and people abhor harshness.\nTo grow too high without restraint, Heaven shall cut it down;\nTo spread too wide without end, Earth shall sever it;\nTo press too harshly without cease, the people shall rise against it.\n\nWhen one comes to rule, all eyes turn to behold.\nWords must be one, deeds must be one—gain it and never lose it.\nWords must be refined, deeds must be harmonious—gain it and never abandon it.\n\nThus, speech is the seal of the heart, expression its bloom, and qi its manifestation.\nTo have words without deeds is called deceit.\nTherefore, words must precede, deeds must follow.\n\nThe straight tree is felled, the upright man is slain.\nWithout form, without name, it precedes Heaven and Earth—yet remains unformed to this day.\n\n**The Way of Governance**\nThe Yellow Emperor asked Lièhé:\n*\"How did the Great Xià (Xītíng) hold sway over all under Heaven?\nHe did not distinguish yin and yang, nor count the days and months,\nNor mark the four seasons—yet the land was fertile and abundant.\nHow did he achieve this?\"*\n\nLièhé replied:\n*\"The Great Xià held sway with tranquility and ease, his gentle measures first established.\nHe was warm yet modest, humble yet yielding, always yielding yet never first.\nHis body upright with sincerity and benevolence, his kindness and love for the people profound.\nHis bearing was dignified yet courageous, never daring to act before others.\nHe did not seek favor, nor did he cling to singularity.\nHis conduct was modest, and all he produced was gentle.\n\nHe stood firm in what he did not dare, acted only in what he could not avoid.\nHe demonstrated caution without daring, executed control without presumption.\nHe guarded weakness, tempered it, and made it firm.\nThus, when the people labored, they did not weary;\nwhen they were hungry, they were not starved;\nwhen they died, they did not grieve.\n\nHe did not neglect his people, nor did he lead them to war,\nnor did he become the instigator of chaos, nor the mediator of grudges,\nnor did he plot in secret, nor make unilateral judgments,\nnor scheme to seize another’s lands, nor plunder another’s dwellings.\nHe carefully observed his people, following Heaven and Earth’s natural course.\nHe did not act unilaterally, but waited for the exhaustion of rebellious schemes.\nWhen the land was taken by force, or Heaven opposed the time,\nhe adjusted accordingly and turned adversity to advantage.\nThus, his victories brought no retribution,\nhis conquests no reversal—\nvictory abroad brought fortune at home.\nHis exertions were minimal, yet his renown was great.\nThis was the ultimate in harmony with the Dao.\nThis was the Dao of Governance.\"*\n\nTo discern gain and loss,

      "translated_text": "The *Yellow Emperor’s Four Passages* [Warring States Period] by an Anonymous Author\n\n**The Dao/Way and Law**\nThe Dao/Way generates Law.\nLaw is that which draws out virtue/power and loss, and clarifies what is crooked and straight.\n\nThose who hold the Dao/Way in their mouths\nGenerate Law yet dare not violate it.\nLaw is established yet dare not be abandoned.\n\nIf one can regulate oneself with Law,\nThen one perceives the knowledge of the world\nAnd is no longer confused.\n\n**The Origin of All Things**\nEmpty and formless, its essence is profound and obscure—\nThe source from which all things arise.\n\nLife brings harm: called *desire*, called *not knowing contentment*.\nLife must move: movement brings harm—\nCalled *acting without due time*, called *acting at the wrong time*.\n\nAction has purpose: purpose brings harm—\nCalled *contrariness*, called *inappropriateness*, not knowing what to use.\nAction must have speech: speech brings harm—\nCalled *untrustworthiness*, called *not revering others*, called *self-deception*, called *hollow boasting*, using insufficiency as excess.\n\nThus, from the same obscure origin,\nSome die, some live;\nSome fail, some succeed.\nCalamity and blessing share the same Dao/Way,\nYet none know their true source.\n\nThe Dao/Way of knowing is only in the *Empty and Formless*.\nThe *Empty and Formless* solidifies into *form and name*,\nAnd thus *form and name* are established—\nThen the distinction between black and white is clear.\n\nTherefore, those who hold the Dao/Way and observe the world\nDo not cling, do not dwell,\nDo not act, do not favor.\nThus, in the world, when there are matters,\nNone escape the *form and name* and the labels they bear.\n\nOnce *form and name* are set and labels are fixed,\nThere is no place to flee or hide from their truth.\n\nThe public must be clear,\nAnd the most clear bring *virtue/power*.\nThe most upright are serene,\nAnd the most serene are sage.\nThe impartial know wisdom,\nAnd the wisest are the world’s measure.\n\n**Judging with Balance and Scrutiny**\nWeigh with scales, measure with the heavens’ standard.\nIn the world, when there are matters,\nThere must be clever proofs.\n\nIf matters are as straight as wood,\nAnd their abundance like stored grain—\nOnce the bushels and stones are in place,\nAnd the measurements are laid out,\nThen none can escape their truth.\n\nWhen measurements are complete,\nThen govern and control them.\n\n**The Mysterious Workings of Nature**\nSevered yet returning, lost yet restored—\nWho knows their essence?\n\nDead yet living, turning calamity into blessing,\nHolding to the limits of their Dao/Way,\nAnd seeking without *form and name*—\nThus one knows the source of calamity and blessing,\nThe Dao/Way of transformation,\nBalanced and at rest.\n\n**Misalignment with the Dao/Way**\nLight and heavy not in balance—\nThis is called *losing the Dao/Way*.\n\nHeaven and Earth have fixed constants,\nThe common people have fixed affairs,\nNobility and lowliness have fixed ranks,\nMinisterial servants have fixed duties,\nAnd the governance of the people has fixed measures.\n\nThe fixed constants of Heaven and Earth:\nThe four seasons, eclipses and brightness, life and death, yielding and firm.\n\nThe fixed affairs of the common people:\nMen till the fields, women weave.\n\nThe fixed ranks of nobility and lowliness:\nThe worthy do not obstruct, the unworthy do not interfere.\n\nThe fixed duties of ministerial servants:\nAssign tasks without exceeding their abilities.\n\nThe fixed measures for governing the people:\nRemove private favor and establish the public.\n\nTo alter the fixed and exceed the measures,\nAnd to use the unusual to counter—\nThe upright and unusual have their ranks,\nYet *form and name* do not depart.\n\nAll matters, great or small,\nNaturally find their place.\n\nLife and death, success and failure—\nThings naturally have their names.\nOnce *form and name* are defined,\nThings naturally have their truth.\n\nThus, only those who hold the Dao/Way\nCan ascend to understand Heaven’s reversals,\nAnd in the midst grasp the balance between ruler and subject.\nThey must secretly observe the end and beginning of all things,\nYet not act as their master.\n\nThus, they can attain the utmost simplicity and subtlety,\nBoundless and without *form and name*,\nAnd then they can serve as the world’s standard.\n\n**The Dao/Way and Law of the State**\nIf a state loses its proper sequence,\nThen the ancestral altars will become its great rectifiers.\nTo seize without giving,\nThe state will inevitably perish.\n\nIf one exhausts Heaven’s limits,\nThe declining will rise again.\n\nTo punish and prohibit improperly,\nOne will instead suffer the calamity.\n\nTo punish and prohibit those deserving death and destruction,\nThe state will become a ruin.\n\nTo combine without usurpation—\nThis is called *Heaven’s virtue/power*.\n\nHeaven and Earth are impartial,\nThe four seasons do not cease.\n\nHeaven and Earth established,\nThe sage therefore follows.\n\nTo exceed the limits and lose the proper—\nHeaven will bring calamity.\n\nIf man overpowers Heaven,\nBe cautious and avoid what is improper.\n\nIf Heaven overpowers man,\nConform and proceed together.\nFirst bend, then extend,\nAnd one will exhaust Heaven’s limits\nWithout usurping Heaven’s virtue/power.\n\nTo combine the states of others,\nTo fortify their city walls,\nTo dwell in their halls and temples,\nTo listen to their bells and drums,\nTo exploit their resources and wealth,\nTo take their children as wives—\nThis is called *invading with wantonness*,\nAnd the state will face peril, ruin, and destruction.\n\nThus, only the sage can exhaust Heaven’s limits\nAnd use Heaven’s proper measures.\n\nThe Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth\nDoes not exceed three *virtues/powers*.\nIf *virtue/power* is complete yet one does not stop,\nOne’s body will be endangered and calamity will come.\n\nThus, the sage’s punishments\nWhen combining others’ states,\nOverthrow their city walls,\nBurn their bells and drums,\nDistribute their wealth and resources,\nScatter their children,\nAnd divide their lands\nTo reward the worthy—\nThis is called *Heaven’s virtue/power*.\n\nIf *virtue/power* is complete yet not abandoned,\nThe later generations will not meet calamity.\n\nDo not secretly usurp in the sun,\nDo not secretly usurp in the shade,\nDo not exhaust the land,\nDo not seize the people,\nDo not form factions.\n\nThose who secretly usurp in the sun—\nHeaven will take away their light.\nThose who secretly usurp in the shade—\nThe land will become desolate.\nThose who exhaust the land—\nHeaven will send armies against them.\nThose who seize the people—\nThey will be scattered to the four directions.\nThose who form factions—\nWill be attacked within their own borders.\n\nSecretly usurping in the sun brings illness,\nSecretly usurping in the shade brings famine,\nExhausting the land brings loss of territory,\nSeizing the people brings loss of subjects,\nForming factions brings chaos—\nThese are the five *inversions*,\nAnd all five *inversions* realized,\nWill bring *just deserts*—\nThe firmness of Heaven’s retribution,\nChanging what is fixed, disrupting what is constant,\nUsurping control and altering the seasons—\nIf one’s heart desires to act thus,\nOne’s body will be endangered and calamity will come.\nThis is called *exceeding the limits and losing the proper*.",

      "translated_text": "In days of old, the Yellow Sovereign first took delight in sincerity,\nAnd fashioned a self-representing **symbol**—square in form,\nWith a single **heart** attached, extending in four directions from its center,\nFront and back aligned, left and right aligned,\nStanding firm upon its **position** with measured steps.\nThus, he became the **sovereign** for all under Heaven.\n\nI received my mandate from Heaven,\nEstablished my **position** upon Earth,\nAnd earned my **name** among the people.\nOnly I, alone, am **paired** with Heaven,\nAnd thus I set up the Three Kings and Three Ministers.\nI established nations and placed rulers over the Three Ministers.\nCounting days, marking months, calculating years,\nTo align with the movements of sun and moon.\n\nThe Earth is vast and abundant—\nI emulate Heaven’s great luminosity.\nI revere Heaven, cherish Earth, and love the people.\nWithout mandate, I grasp **emptiness** and hold to sincerity.\nI revere Heaven, cherish Earth, and love the people,\nAnd establish mandate, grasping **emptiness** and holding to sincerity.\nI love the people, and the people do not perish;\nI love the Earth, and the Earth does not lie barren.\nI receive the people’s [unclear]—\n[unclear]—until death.\nMy **position** is [unclear].\nIf I can but love the near and promote the worthy,\nI shall not be abandoned, and my virtue will reach its height.\n\nI obey Heaven’s command and follow the **Yellow Sovereign’s** decree,\nAs **Lìhé** [力黑] conceals himself and wanders through the four nations,\nObserving the enduring and virtuous ways.\n**Lìhé** demonstrates the **symbol**—\nWhen he sees black, it is black;\nWhen he sees white, it is white.\nWhen the Earth [unclear]—\nIf the people are evil, he acts with caution;\nIf the people are still, he is still;\nIf the people act, he acts.\n**Lìhé**, having established measures and set the extremes,\nDeclared: *\"Heaven and Earth are complete,\nYet the people’s **conduct** is disordered—\nNo distinction between obedience and rebellion,\nNo virtue or punishment,\nNo stillness or action,\nNo order of precedence or **name**.\"*\n\nNow I wish to establish the **principles** of obedience and rebellion,\nTo set the proper times for stillness and action under Heaven,\nAnd thus record them—\nHow shall I proceed?\n\nThe Yellow Sovereign said:\n*\"All things were originally one,\nWithout obscurity or clarity,\nWithout yin or yang.\nYin and yang were not yet distinguished,\nAnd I had no **name** for them.\nNow I divide them into two—\nYin and yang.\nSeparating them into the **four seasons**—\n[unclear]—\nAnd thus establish them as constants.\nThe bright ones take this as **law**,\nAnd the **Dao** is followed subtly.\nFollowing the **law**, conforming to the **principles** of male and female,\nMale and female seeking each other,\nHard and soft meeting,\nSoft and hard completing each other—\nMale and female taking **form**.\nBelow, they unite with Earth;\nAbove, they unite with Heaven.\nObtaining Heaven’s subtlety,\nAt the time when [unclear]—\nWaiting for Earth’s **qi** to rise,\nThen germination begins to germinate,\nAnd growth to grow—\nHeaven completes it.\nWithout this, it does not succeed;\nWithout nurturing, it does not thrive.\n\nThe people, when born, seek only to eat and reproduce.\nIf they do not unite, they cannot reproduce;\nWithout food, they cannot sustain themselves on Earth.\nIf they do not eat, they cannot sustain themselves in Heaven.\nThus, the **abundance of yin** spreads virtue,\nAnd the **abundance of yang** fulfills the people’s labor—\nThis is how they are fed.\nThe **host of yang** refines its **form**,\nThe **heavy yin** [unclear]—\nNurturing the long night, sealing the Earth’s womb—\nThis is how they reproduce.\nWithout depletion or excess,\nBalancing them with **punishment** and **virtue**.\nSpring and summer are **virtue**,\nAutumn and winter are **punishment**.\nPrioritizing **virtue** over **punishment** to nurture life.\nOnce **names** are established,\nThe **opposing** give rise to contention.\nWithout **divination**, nothing is certain.\nThe extremes of **divination** lie in **punishment** and **virtue**.\n**Punishment** and **virtue** are grand—\nSun and moon face each other,\nIlluminating their due times,\nAnd neither overflows nor is deficient.\n\nThus, I make the people not **overreach**,\nEnsure actions are not **excessively scrutinized**,\nPrevent the Earth from being **over-exploited**—\nFor if it is over-exploited, the land grows barren;\nIf it is excessively scrutinized, it loses its luster.\n**Overreaching** leads to **martial law**.\n\nTherefore, as a **sovereign**,\nI must regulate the **Three Joys** in season,\nNot disrupt the people’s labor,\nNor defy the **Heavenly timing**.\nThen the five grains will ripen,\nAnd the people will flourish.\nRulers and ministers, above and below,\nWill harmonize in their aspirations.\nHeaven will complete this.\n\nThus, aligning with the **times** to nurture the people’s labor,\nPrioritizing **virtue** over **punishment**,\nConforming to Heaven—\nWhen the **times** are abundant yet affairs falter;\nWhen the **yin nodes** recur in sequence,\nAnd the Earth’s **abundance** withdraws.\nCorrecting **names**, refining **punishment**,\nThe **hibernating creatures** do not emerge,\nFrost and snow clear,\nThe **Meng** grains stand solemn—\nThis is when **disasters** arise.\nThus, if one acts, it will not succeed.\nWhen the **times** falter yet affairs are abundant,\nThe **yang nodes**

      "translated_text": "「Lìhēi replied: *\"Indeed. In ancient times, when Heaven and Earth were formed, the Dao was established with its proper name, and the forms were harmonized to uphold a single principle. It was applied above to Heaven, and extended below to the Four Seas. I have heard that under Heaven there are fixed methods, hence it is said: 'Do not multiply words, for one statement suffices.' Follow the proper name and uphold unity, and the people will not disrupt their principles.\"*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said: *\"Is there still another Way under Heaven?\"*\nLìhēi replied: *\"Indeed. In ancient times, the August Heaven sent Feng to descend with a single statement that sufficed. The Five Emperors employed it to measure the harmony of Heaven and Earth, to gauge the Four Seas, to embrace the common people, and to rectify the worthies of the age. Thus, slanderous folk all withdrew, virtuous men arose universally, the Five Evils fled, and the age of flattery and sophistry came to an end. Follow the proper name and uphold unity, and the people will not disrupt their principles.\"*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said: *\"When you speak of 'unity,' is it merely unity, or does it also have its length?\"*\nLìhēi replied: *\"Unity is the root of the Dao—how could it lack its length? What is lost by all, none can uphold unity. The essence of unity is observed in Heaven and Earth; its principle is applied to the Four Seas. How does one know its full extent? Through the near and far, it is measured by never losing unity. With unity, one can govern the myriad; with little, one can know much. When gazing far across the Four Seas, and considering the utmost of high and low, all directions embrace their own Dao. Among myriad words, there is a root; among thousands, there is a key; among tens of thousands, there is a summary. Though myriad things abound, they all pass through a single gateway. He who is not upright yet seizes the ability to govern this—he is not upright. Only the virtuous can wield rectitude to rectify the strange, grasp unity to know the myriad, remove the people’s harms, and maintain what benefits them. Embracing unity and guarding the one, he aligns with the utmost limits of Heaven and Earth, thus understanding their blessings and calamities. Fixed methods that are not constant—Heaven forbids them. Disruptive undertakings—Earth forbids them. Those who lose their commands—sovereigns forbid them. When these three prohibitions are observed, the state is nearly secure. Earth’s prohibitions are: do not drain the high, do not increase the low, do not encroach upon rivers, do not defy the land, do not obstruct the people’s clarity. Advancing without yielding, standing without humility, trampling upon propriety—this is called great misfortune. In human affairs, rigidity and flexibility: rigidity alone is insufficient, and flexibility alone cannot be relied upon. The rigid yet fierce as a tiger perishes; the weak yet drowning in indulgence also perishes. Those who do not uphold ancient laws and proper institutions die; those who monopolize profit and cut short rituals to dwell in luxury are doomed to emptiness. The Dao of Heaven is constant, spread across the lower lands, applied to the Nine Regions. Thus, kings and nobles must be cautious in their commands, so the people know their proper course. Heaven has fixed days; the people follow them naturally. If they deviate, their lives are diminished, and they return to servitude—this is the Dao of Heaven.\"*\n\n**On Prohibitions**\n*\"All states that store arms possess military methods. The methods of warfare under Heaven are three: some wage war for profit, some for righteousness, and some for anger. Those who wage war for profit, seeing the people hungry and the state in disarray, with high and low out of place, raise arms to seize them—though they gain no great profit, they also cause no great harm. Those who wage war for righteousness, strike down disorder and suppress tyranny, elevate the virtuous and remove the unworthy—this is called righteousness. The aggressor, though, is the one whom the multitude will slay. Thus, to attack all under Heaven with a single state, or to conquer the world with a thousand-chariot lord—few begin this, and none can complete it, for their resolve is not constant, and they turn back when exhausted. Those who wage war in anger—though their hearts are filled with fury, they cannot merely rage. Anger must have purpose; success must not be sought for its own sake. If they begin with aggression, it is not the Dao. The Dao’s practice is without obstruction. Without obstruction, there is no exhaustion. Hence, the aggressor is doomed, and the prohibitor is the agent of order. Therefore, when advancing, do not linger in place.\"*\n\n**On the Foundation of Undertakings**\n*\"The wise act in accordance with Heaven and Earth, align with the people, and bring auspiciousness to spirits and ghosts. They make the people share in benefit, and all rely upon them—this is called righteousness. Their bodies bear the burdens at the forefront; their sovereigns employ them. They bring lasting benefit to the state’s ancestral altars, to the people of the age, and to myriad lineages. When the world’s name is renowned, yet they are not employed, it is in vain. He who gains benefit with a single word is a worthy scholar. He who gains benefit for the state with a single word is a state’s worthy scholar. Thus, the virtuous humble themselves to follow the Dao, use wisdom to discern it, strength to enact it, and cherish its harmony with the age. In times when flexibility is needed to await it, if kings and nobles know this, the state is fortunate. A great state with many people, though its burdens are borne at the rear, is also doomed to misfortune. Hence, the ruler does not rely on fortune to govern the state. To govern the state, there is the Way of the Foreground: to know Heaven’s times above, Earth’s advantages below, and human affairs within. To practice the harmony of yin and yang is to govern; to seize the strange is to bring disorder. Rectified names do not falter; strange names do not stand. The Dao, when upright, is without peril; it can be followed or begun. Thus, one may govern the myriad, one may govern the state. Governing the myriad, one achieves success; governing the state, one achieves peace. Small states gain it to defend their borders; great states gain it to unite and conquer all under Heaven. The Dao has its origin but no end; those who employ it prosper, those who do not merely observe. Following it brings beauty; adhering to it brings constancy. The ancient worthies practiced this Way. Knowing this Way, spirits and ghosts align with them, and so do Earth and Heaven, making them flourish in military and in state. The ancient worthies practiced this Way. The Way of the Foreground—Heaven has fixed days, Earth has fixed constants.\"*",
