  "full_translation": "**The Comprehensive Meaning of the Supreme and Wondrous Scripture of Primordial Beginning’s Limitless Salvation of Humanity**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Comprehensive Meaning of the Supreme and Wondrous Scripture of Primordial Beginning’s Limitless Salvation of Humanity*\n*Composed by the Forty-Third Celestial Master Zhang Yuchu. Four fascicles.*\n*Source text:* *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, *Dongzhen* Section, *Jade Instructions* Category.\n\n---\n\n### *Fascicle One of The Comprehensive Meaning of the Supreme and Wondrous Scripture of Primordial Beginning’s Limitless Salvation of Humanity*\n*Annotated by the Forty-Third Celestial Master Zhang Yuchu, Orthodox Unity Lineage Successor, Dao-Harmonized Non-Action Expounder, Illustrious Ancestral Model, Perfected of Radiant Virtue, and Overseer of Daoist Affairs*\n\n#### **Diagram of the Supreme Ultimate’s Wondrous Transformation, the Divine and Chaotic Crimson Text**\n#### **Diagram of the River Chart’s Symbolic Numerology**\nHeaven One, Earth Two; Heaven Three, Earth Four; Heaven Five, Earth Six; Heaven Seven, Earth Eight; Heaven Nine, Earth Ten. The heavenly numbers are five, the earthly numbers are five—five positions intermingle, each with its own union.\nThe heavenly numbers total twenty-five; the earthly numbers, thirty. The sum of heaven and earth’s numbers is fifty-five, by which transformations are accomplished and the spirits of ghosts and deities are set in motion.\nWhen the generative and productive root numbers of the Five Directions are subtracted by three, the dragon emerges from fire, the tiger arises from water, the mother conceals the embryo of the child, and the child returns to the mother’s womb. All these are the wonders of the sevenfold return of the Golden Elixir, the ninefold restoration of cinnabar, and the Golden Liquid. Thus, they are no different from the fourteenfold meaning in the scripture.\n\n#### **Diagram of the Thunder’s Single Aperture**\n*Master Baopuzi* states: The Mysterious Female’s single aperture refers to the non-[dual], heart, kidneys, nose, mouth, liver, lungs, grain passage, bladder, and Muddy Pellet.\nTo know this single aperture is to grasp the fire-times of the Winter Solstice, the medicinal substances, the bathing [of the elixir], the shedding of the embryo, and the congealing of the embryo—all lie herein.\nThis aperture is the aperture of thunder, and by attaining it, the mechanism of thunder and dew is captured; there is no need for external seeking.\nThe Perfected who ascend in emptiness employ this. The resonance of Dao and method is but a secondary matter.\n\n#### **Diagram of the Thunder’s Pivotal Mechanism and Mutual Employment**\n**Thunder**\nThunder is the pivot of heaven. Its nature is good, its governance is life, its substance is yang, its image is yin—thus, *jia*, *bing*, *geng*, and *ren* are yang thunder.\n**Lightning**\nLightning is the mechanism of earth. Its nature is evil, its governance is killing, its substance is yin, its image is yang—thus, *yi*, *ji*, *ding*, and *xin* are yin lightning.\n**Mutual Employment of Thunder and Lightning**\nQian and Kun share the same body; sun and moon form a single jade disk. When set in motion, they resound with thunderclaps.\n\n#### **Diagram of the Vast and Profound Mystery**\nHeaven is free of defilement,\nEarth is free of demonic dust.\nDark wisdom pervades clarity—\nVast and profound, the mystery of mysteries.\nThe True of the Limitless penetrates the Book,\nThe Sincere of the Unwavering Center embodies Integrity.\nWithin the True, the Primordial holds the Emperor;\nBeyond Sincerity, there are no further spirits.\nMerging the natures of heaven and earth,\nWhipping and driving the body of wind and thunder.\nThe one whose nature is their body—\nThis is the person of utmost truth and sincerity.\n\n#### **Symbol of Cultivation in the Round Heaven and Square Earth**\nThis diagram aligns with the Precelestial Trigram’s square and round diagrams. Each point within corresponds to a single character from the *Ling Shu*’s configurations. When examined together with the two preceding diagrams, the wonders of heaven and earth become visible—though not exhaustively so.\n\n---\n\n### *The Supreme and Wondrous Scripture of the Limitless Salvation of Humanity from the Numinous Treasure of the Cavernous Mystery*\n*Tai* (Supreme) means great. *Shang* (Upper) means revered. The \"upper\" beyond all upper is the utmost reverence.\n*Dongxuan* (Cavernous Mystery) is a designation of rank. Scriptures comprise the Three Caverns: *Dongzhen* (Cavern of Perfection), presided over by the Primordial Beginning; *Dongxuan* (Cavern of Mystery), presided over by the Numinous Treasure; and *Dongshen* (Cavern of Spirits), presided over by the Dao and its Virtue.\nThis scripture was originally proclaimed by the Primordial Beginning and recorded by the Dao Lord, hence the title *Dongxuan Lingbao* (\"Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure\"). Yet the main scripture simply reads *The Supreme and Wondrous Scripture of Primordial Beginning’s Limitless Salvation of Humanity*, distinguishing it from the prefaces and postscripts.\nThe \"words of the Dao\" are the words of the Supreme Jade Dawn Dao Lord.\nTogether, it is titled *The Supreme Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure*, for the Dao Lord received the Primordial Beginning’s decree to save humanity without limit—this being the title of the single fascicle.\nAmong the thirty-six sections of the Three Caverns, this scripture stands first, hence \"supreme.\"\n*Miao* (Wondrous) denotes the utmost subtlety and profundity, the abstruse and unfathomable.\n*Jing* (Scripture) means \"path\"—the shared Way of daily cultivation and true refinement.\nWhen cultivated internally, it is called the Elixir, the primordial true unity’s ancestral *qi*. Above, there is no further ancestor—only the Dao is supremely revered.\n*Dong* (Cavernous) signifies emptiness, clarity, and luminosity; *xuan* (mystery), profound stillness and subtlety.\n*Ling* (Numinous) is the enduring true nature; *bao* (treasure) is the flowing primordial destiny.\nBy cultivating it within the body, one can save others. The saved are boundless, not subject to limitation.\nTo realize the supreme vehicle of the Dao is not apart from one’s own mind. This mind is the Dao, is the scripture—thus, empty and numinous without obstruction, it saves humanity without limit.\n\n**The Dao Speaks:**\nLong ago, in the Azure Heaven of the Beginning, within the vast expanse of the Blue Empyrean, in the land of Great Floating Black, I received from the Primordial Beginning the *Supreme and Wondrous Scripture of the Limitless Salvation of Humanity*.\n\"The Dao speaks\" refers to the words of the Supreme Jade Dawn Dao Lord. This preface’s title recounts how the Dao Lord received the scripture in the past, recording the circumstances of its compilation.\n*Shiqing* (Beginning Azure) is the Azure Heaven of the Nine *Qi* of the East—one of the Nine Heavens of Divine Empyrean. This heaven is congealed from the *qi* of Brahma, its azure radiance vast and boundless, hence \"Blue Empyrean.\"\nThe *qi* of azure radiance congeals into jade groves and jasper trees, stirred by numinous winds that spontaneously form the *kong song* (\"empty hymn\").\n*Dafulitu* is the name of a country in the Eastern Ultimate. The Dao Lord states: \"In the past, in the land of Floating Black within the Azure Heaven of the Beginning, I received the wondrous scripture from the Primordial Beginning Heavenly Worthy to broadly save heavenly and human beings—this is the *Supreme and Wondrous Scripture of the Limitless Salvation of Humanity*.\"\nThe \"land\" is the Central Palace; the \"mystery\" is the Pass. Its number is five, the ancestor of heaven, earth, and the myriad things. Thus, the hundred creatures are born from earth and return to earth. This is our mysterious pass, the precious pearl.\nThe primordial spirit is the Primordial Beginning. The endless generation and transformation of the ten thousand existences all arise from it.\n*Shiqing* is the image of wood. Fire is the dragon. *Zhen*’s number is three—Qian’s first line seeks and gives birth to the eldest son, just as spring stands first among the four seasons, and the myriad things arise through it.\nYet the first unity gives birth to water, and water gives birth to wood...\n\nFire arises from two, and fire is born from wood—this is the cyclic principle of the Five Phases, the inexhaustible pattern of ceaseless generation, which may be called manifest indeed.\n\nWhen the Most High Lord of the Dao was to expound this scripture, he circumambulated ten times to summon the ten directions, and only then ascended his seat. *Yuan* is akin to the primordial *qi* of Qian and Kun. Prior to heaven and earth, heaven and earth arose through it—this is the origin of the myriad transformations, the ancestor of the ten thousand forms, the responsive title of the Most Venerable Sovereign of the Void, and thus the supreme honor of all heavens.\n\nAt that time, he expounded the salvific teachings of the *Scripture of Salvation for Humanity*, circumambulating ten times to summon the exalted sages and lofty venerables of the ten directions. They assembled within the Millet Pearl, unfolding the wondrous mysteries, and only then did he ascend his seat to expound the scripture.\n\nThe Primordial Beginning is the ancestral *qi* of the Dharma-body, the primordial spirit. It is the indestructible true emptiness, the original self-nature. When this scripture was expounded, the ancestral *qi* became the essence of the elixir, and as long as the primordial spirit remained undimmed, the mandate of heaven flowed ceaselessly, circulating through the six voids, without beginning in movement or stillness, endlessly coming and going—this is the tenfold circumambulation.\n\nThe ten circumambulations consist of five generative numbers and five consummate numbers, for ten is the consummate number of heaven and earth. The elixir is perfected after ten months of refinement. The ten directions comprise the odd numbers—one, three, five, seven, nine—as yang, and the even numbers—two, four, six, eight, ten—as yin. This is the wondrous function of the returning elixir. Within the mysterious pass, when the true yin and true yang *qi* achieve harmony, the hundred meridians of the body resonate like converging rivers, just as the true sages of the ten directions assemble without summons.\n\nThe celestial perfected deities, exalted sages, wondrously accomplished immortals, and innumerable hosts arrived riding the void, soaring on vermilion clouds through the cinnabar skies, their jade wheels and feathered canopies casting shade, their flowing essence and jade radiance suffusing the five colors in vibrant splendor, illuminating the great emptiness.\n\nThe countless perfected immortals—comprising the five hundred million deities of the heavens, the sun, moon, and stars, the celestial and terrestrial spirits, the watery palaces of heaven and earth, and the immortals and sages of the three realms and ten directions—could not be numbered. All at once, they arrived riding the void, traversing the firmament without movement, borne on tri-colored clouds and crimson mists. Their wheel-chariots and feathered canopies manifested a hundred forms and myriad transformations of the true sages, their numinous changes beyond comprehension. Their flowing essence and jade radiance, suffused with the five colors, intermingled with the luminous brilliance of the Three Lights, their perfected forms resplendent—thus the five hues blazed across the great emptiness, luminous and all-pervading, inwardly cultivated.\n\nOnce the Queen Mother of the West returned to the spirit chamber, she gathered *qi* with her spirit and refined her spirit with *qi*, capturing and restraining lead and mercury, assembling yin and yang. This was the assembly of the thousand perfected and ten thousand sages. In an instant, golden and fiery radiance intermingled within the spirit chamber, illuminating inner and outer, their flowing essence and dazzling colors suffusing the five hues in resplendent brilliance across the great emptiness.\n\nFor seven days and seven nights, the sun, moon, and stars of the heavens, the jade celestial pivots, all halted their revolutions. The divine winds stilled, mountains and seas concealed their clouds. The heavens were free of floating veils, the four *qi* clear and bright. The lands of the realm—mountains, rivers, forests, and trees—were leveled as one, without distinction of high or low. All became azure jade, without variation in hue.\n\nSeven is the number of fire, signifying the sevenfold return. As the *Book of Changes* states: \"After seven days, it returns.\" All numbers, upon reaching seven, revert. The earlier Confucians said: \"Yang is born at *zi*, yin at *wu*. From *wu* to *zi*, after seven, it must return—this is the principle of the waxing and waning of Qian and Kun.\" Speaking of a single day, from noon to midnight, it returns to the *zi* hour. Speaking of a year, from the fifth month when yin is born, to the eleventh month, it returns to the *zi* month. Speaking of a month, from the *wu* day, after nearly seven days, it returns to the *zi* day. This is the fixed pattern of the heavens' movement.\n\nThe \"heavens\" refer to the thirty-two heavens. The \"sun, moon, and stars, jade celestial pivots\" denote the constellations of the celestial sphere and the seven stars of the Northern Dipper. \"Halted their revolutions\" means that the celestial bodies, though ceaselessly revolving, at this moment ceased their motion, returning to their root, the central path alone reverting. Through stillness, they returned, their breath ceasing to enter or exit. Thus, the divine winds stilled, thoughts vanished, and *qi* flowed without distinction of above or below—like mountains and rivers concealing their great clouds and mists, the heavens' floating veils removed, the four *qi* became clear and bright. The lands of the realm—Fuli’s earth—mountains, rivers, forests, and trees were leveled as one, without distinction of high or low. During the scripture’s recitation, with spirit suspended and gaze fixed, pulses stilled and heart ceased, nature reverted and emotions dissolved, all concerns vanished—thus all was leveled as one. The self-nature, like polished jade, was without variation in hue.\n\nThose who cultivate the Dao, forgetting form and severing thoughts, emptying all phenomena, embody a serene nature, the solitary truth revealed—then the scenery of their body, the hundred meridians all stilled, true lead manifests its radiance. This is called \"the earth all becoming azure jade.\" The Mysterious Master said: \"This is the great samadhi, the spirit’s light serene, beholding the Jade Clarity’s realm.\"\n\nThe assembled perfected ones attended the seat as the Most High Lord of the Dao sat in mystery upon the void, floating five *zhang* above the five-colored lions. The Primordial Beginning is the primordial spirit. The \"mysterious seat\" is the spirit chamber. Thus, it floated five *zhang* above the earth, unattached to any form. The five colors are the wondrously transformed *qi*. The lions are the knowing of the heart. The assembled perfected ones attended to the left and right as the Dharma-body of the Primordial Beginning sat in mystery, floating in the void, the five *qi* paying homage to the Crimson Palace. The five colors shone brightly—this is the primordial spirit dwelling in the spirit chamber, darkening the heart to gather *qi*, the three realms merging, the knowing of the heart wondrously bright, illuminating the great emptiness. Thus, the colors of the five directions intermingled in the Central Yellow Palace.\n\nUpon the first recitation of the scripture, all the heavenly sages and great saints simultaneously voiced their approval. At that moment, the deaf among men and women of the entire kingdom regained their hearing. Upon the second recitation, the blind saw clearly. Upon the third recitation, the mute could speak. Upon the fourth recitation, the lame and those afflicted with chronic ailments all rose and walked. Upon the fifth recitation, those suffering from long-standing illnesses and stubborn diseases instantly regained their original form. Upon the sixth recitation, white hair turned black again, and fallen teeth regrew. Upon the seventh recitation, the old reverted to youth, and the young grew stronger. Upon the eighth recitation, pregnant women and creatures bearing young—whether already born or yet unborn—all attained perfect formation. Upon the ninth recitation, the earth’s treasuries opened, and gold and jade revealed their forms. Upon the tenth recitation, withered bones revived, all rising as complete human beings.\n\nAt that time, every man and woman in the kingdom, without exception, turned their hearts in devotion, all receiving protection and deliverance, attaining longevity and eternal life. The nine transformations of the golden elixir achieve their perfection in the ten-month gestation, wherein spirit is wondrously transformed. The generative numbers of the *River Chart* proceed from one to ten, engendering endless life. The permutations of the *Luo Scripture* eliminate the ten in favor of the vertical and horizontal, the one and five and ten—these are the unchanging, fixed numbers of heaven, earth, and the five phases. How could the myriad things and affairs of the world defy them?\n\nThus, the first recitation corresponds to \"Heaven One generates Water.\" Water is conceived within Qian Metal, so the child dwells in the mother’s womb—this is called the *qi* of emptiness within the golden embryo. All things in heaven and earth arise from this, for water is the beginning of all numbers. The simultaneous praise of the heavenly sages and great saints signifies universal joy and approval, enabling the *qi* to circulate fully and the hundred spirits to flourish. The men and women of the kingdom are like the *qi* of yin and yang within a single body. When this *qi* is released, the deaf naturally regain their hearing. Moreover, Kan governs the ears; once the first number is complete, the deaf are naturally unblocked.\n\nThe second recitation corresponds to \"Earth Two generates Fire.\" Fire is conceived within Xun Wood, so the mother conceals the child in her womb—this is called the union of wood and fire in the same position. Moreover, Li governs the eyes; once the second number is complete, the brilliance of Li shines resplendently, and no eye remains unilluminated.\n\nThe third recitation corresponds to \"Heaven Three generates Wood.\" Zhen Wood is conceived within Gen Water. Furthermore, sound pertains to metal, which fundamentally restrains wood yet paradoxically lodges in the womb of metal. This is wood severed in Shen but gestating in You—a symbol of metal hidden within wood. When metal and wood are restrained, they must resonate, so even the mute can speak.\n\nThe fourth recitation corresponds to \"Earth Four generates Metal.\" Dui Metal is conceived within Kun Earth, for earth can generate metal. The feet fundamentally pertain to wood, yet upon the fourth recitation, the lame and chronically ill rise and walk. Metal is severed in Yin but gestates in Mao—this illustrates the symbol of wood within metal.\n\nThe fifth recitation corresponds to \"Heaven Five generates Earth.\" Wu Earth is conceived within Li Fire, attaining the correctness of heaven and earth. Flowing from Wu to Si, the two earths form a *gui*. Thus, Kan’s Wu is the essence of the moon, and Li’s Si is the radiance of the sun—sun and moon unite as one. If one knows how to cultivate and refine, restraining anger and suppressing desires, preserving the heart and nurturing nature, ceaselessly pursuing the work of inner refinement, then the Great One contains the true, the Mysterious Pearl takes form, and one becomes one body with heaven and earth. Attaining longevity and enduring vision would then be effortless. How could long-standing illnesses and stubborn diseases remain a concern? Those afflicted by illness and misfortune do so because they do not comprehend the wonder of returning and restoration.\n\nThe sixth recitation corresponds to \"Earth Six completes it.\" Heaven One generates Water, and Kan resides in the north, yang containing true yin. Thus, Qian Metal generates Kan Water to form true lead. Lead is the mother of metal; lead is black, and metal is white, so white hair turns black again, and fallen teeth regrow—all responses of returning to the root.\n\nThe seventh recitation corresponds to \"Heaven Seven completes it.\" Earth Two generates Fire, and Li resides in the south, yin containing true yang. Thus, Xun Wood generates Li Fire to form true mercury—this is the seventh return. When Li mercury is restrained by metal lead, metal and fire warmly refine. Qian Metal is old yang, and Li Fire is young yin. Thus, the old revert to youth, and the young grow stronger.\n\nThe eighth recitation corresponds to \"Earth Eight completes it.\" Heaven Three generates Wood, and Zhen resides in the east. Gen and Zhen combine to form water, mercury responds to the *qi* of lead and congeals into cinnabar. Cinnabar contains the essence of mercury, symbolizing pregnancy—all is the *qi* of the primordial true one, coalescing within the compass, giving rise to the myriad things. Day and night it circulates, nurturing the sacred embryo, for it is not the *qi* of postnatal yin dregs that can foster it. Thus, pregnant women and creatures bearing young—whether already born or yet unborn—all attain perfect formation.\n\nThe ninth recitation corresponds to \"Heaven Nine completes it.\" Earth Four generates Metal, and Dui resides in the west. Dui Metal unites with Kun Earth, and Kan Water is concealed within the mother’s womb—this is the ninth return. Thus, mercury returns to the earthen crucible and becomes treasure, the *qi* returning to its source. Initially born from the *qi* of emptiness within the golden embryo, the metal’s essence was unseen. Now, at this stage, metal resides in the initial stirring of nature, returning to the Central Palace to become the elixir’s body. The center is earth, and earth is the ground. Thus, the earth’s treasuries open, and gold and jade reveal their forms—gold’s mother resides within the Central Palace.\n\nThe tenth recitation corresponds to \"Earth Ten completes it.\" Heaven Five generates Earth, and earth resides in the center, for earth is the root of the myriad things’ generation and completion. The earth of Heaven Five is yang earth; the earth of Earth Ten is yin earth. When the two earths are layered, they form a *gui*, so the returned elixir is called a *blade gui*. Metal resides within it—this is Qian Metal restraining Li Fire within Kun Earth, the so-called inversion and extension of the five phases. If one cultivates this, one can reverse aging and return to youth, transcend the ordinary and enter sagehood, thus reviving the dead, as the Most High did with Xu Jia.\n\nThus it is said: withered bones revive, all arise as complete beings. At this time, in that land, whether man or woman, none fails to turn their heart whole. Among all the men and women of that land, upon hearing the scriptural teachings, all receive protection and deliverance, attaining the Dao of longevity.\n\nThe land is like the body; men and women are the yin and yang qi. \"Turning the heart whole\" means yin and yang unite by kind. When the qi of yin and yang harmonize and intermingle, the Great One returns to the true, the living body receives deliverance, and the dead soul undergoes refinement—this is called longevity.\n\nThe Dao states: when the Most High Lord of the Primordial Beginning recites the scripture once, the boundless, immeasurable hosts of perfected great spirits from the Eastern Direction of the Limitless arrive floating through the void. When he recites it twice, those from the Southern Direction arrive floating through the void. When he recites it thrice, those from the Western Direction arrive floating through the void. When he recites it four times, those from the Northern Direction arrive floating through the void. When he recites it five times, those from the Northeast arrive floating through the void. When he recites it six times, those from the Southeast arrive floating through the void. When he recites it seven times, those from the Southwest arrive floating through the void. When he recites it eight times, those from the Northwest arrive floating through the void. When he recites it nine times, those from the Upper Direction arrive floating through the void. When he recites it ten times, those from the Lower Direction arrive floating through the void. This is the sequence in which the Dao Lord transmitted the scripture from beginning to end.\n\nTen recitations deliver beings; ten revolutions return the numinous—this is the fundamental purport of the scripture and its preface. As the Heavenly Worthy recites the scripture, he summons the boundless hosts of perfected spirits from the ten directions of the Limitless, all arriving floating through the void: from the Eastern Direction, the Brahma-Monitor Xu Yan Heaven and others of the Zhen Palace, Mao position, forming the boundless hosts; from the Southern Direction, the Yüdan Immeasurable Heaven and others of the Li Palace, Wu position, forming the boundless hosts; from the Western Direction, the Spirit-Transformed Brahma-Assistant Heaven and others of the Dui Palace, You position, forming the boundless hosts; from the Northern Direction, the Cavernous Primordial Resonant-Heaven and others of the Kan Palace, Zi position, forming the boundless hosts; from the Northeast, the Lofty Void Pure Bright Heaven and others of the Gen Palace, Yin position, forming the boundless hosts; from the Southeast, the Pāramitā Unconceited Joy Heaven and others of the Xun Palace, Si position, forming the boundless hosts; from the Southwest, the Stillness-Enveloped Tuśita Heaven and others of the Kun Palace, Shen position, forming the boundless hosts; from the Northwest, the Supreme Meditation Goodness Immeasurable Longevity Heaven and others of the Qian Palace, Hai position, forming the boundless hosts; from the Upper Direction, the Nine Empyreans, Upper Clarity, Jade Perfected, and the thirty-six heavens, forming the boundless hosts; from the Lower Direction, the Formless Realm, Form Realm, Desire Realm, and the thirty-two heavens, extending to the boundless hosts of the Three Origins and Nine Earths—all assemble within the Azure Beginning Heaven, in the Floating Black Soil, to hear the scripture and listen to the Dharma.\n\nCultivating this internally, true lead becomes the medicine, and the Primordial Mysterious Pass becomes the foundation of the elixir—this is the recitation of the scripture by the Primordial Beginning. Earth dwells in the Central Palace, naturally forming the number ten; the center is the Mysterious Pass. The ten recitations correspond to the generative and completive numbers of heaven and earth. The ten directions arise from the five phases’ combinations: one, three, five, seven, nine are the celestial numbers, totaling twenty-five, the essence of yang. Two, four, six, eight, ten are the terrestrial numbers, the blossoms of yin. The generative number of yang is five, the root of the five phases; the completive number of yin is ten, the root of the myriad transformations. One and nine, four and six, combined make ten—this is metal and water sharing the same origin. Two and eight, three and seven, combined make ten—this is wood and fire sharing the same body. In total, they make fifty-five, distributed among the five directions.\n\nWhen the five phases are inverted, the dragon emerges from fire, and the tiger arises from water. Fire is born of wood, thus cinnabar draws forth mercury—this is the sevenfold return, cinnabar returning to its origin. Water is born of metal, thus silver refines lead within—this is the ninefold restoration, golden liquid returning to the true. The *Book of Changes* states: \"Heaven and earth intermingle, and the myriad things mate in purity\"—thus the boundless, limitless hosts of perfected great spirits all arrive.\n\nTherefore, the foundation of the elixir mirrors the three hundred eighty-four lines, circulating the fire times. Internally, the five stars revolve, the twenty-eight constellations array in orbit, the crucible hastens the three thousand six hundred upright qi, returns through the seventy-two seasonal nodes, drives the sixty-four hexagrams’ yin tally, and drums the twenty-four qi’s yang fire. Then the three hun guard the form, the seven po return to the body, and the twelve thousand spirits within the body all heed the command—this is called the ten revolutions returning the numinous, the myriad qi ascending together as immortals.\n\nWhen the ten recitations are complete, the perfected great spirits of the ten directions of the Limitless arrive simultaneously. The men and women of the land turn their hearts in devotion, coming like fine rain and dense mist. The boundless hosts press upon half the land, causing the earth to sink everywhere—none can prevent it. When the recitation of the scripture is complete after ten cycles, the great spirits of the ten directions all assemble at once. None among men and women fail to turn in devotion, like the crowds of fine rain and dense mist. Pressing upon half the land, filling half the country, the Heavenly Worthy’s majestic virtue is so weighty that the earth cannot bear it, sinking entirely—yet none can prevent it.\n\nWhen the ten revolutions’ work within the body is complete, one’s thoughts cease and spirit congeals, nature returns and life is restored—then true lead returns to the chamber. The qi of yin and yang within the body blend and fuse, steaming the four limbs like the moistening of rain and mist. Circulating through the six voids, moving above and below without constancy, coming and going without cease, the boundless hosts fill and saturate the space—though the land is pressed and the earth sinks, it cannot be stopped.\n\nThus, the Primordial Beginning suspended a single precious pearl, vast as a millet grain, within the Void Mystery—five measures above the earth.\n\nMaster Xin said: The Primordial Beginning is one’s primordial spirit; the precious pearl is the heart. The Confucians call it the Supreme Ultimate, the Buddhists call it Perfect Enlightenment—yet it is the same principle. The Dao also names it the Mystery Pearl, the Heart Pearl, the Millet Pearl: all refer to this same thing. \"Precious\" signifies the most refined and true, meaning the numinous treasure. \"Vast as a millet grain\" describes how it encompasses the cosmos yet enters the finest hair-tip—what is called \"so great there is nothing beyond, so small there is nothing within,\" its transformations unfathomable. Thus it dwells within the Void Mystery, beyond all trace or pursuit.\n\nThe measure of five above the earth: five is the number of earth, the center of the Five Phases. Like the generative numbers of the Five Phases, the void center embodies the Supreme Ultimate. When the heart is empty, the primordial spirit resides there—this is the Void Mystery. Is this not the golden embryo of empty qi? Therefore, the Mystery Master said: This is the Jade Clarity Precious Pearl, the Dao of divine transformation and immortal embryo.\n\nAccording to Xiao Guanfu: The Primordial Beginning suspending the pearl means spirit and Dao are united. Earlier, the preaching upon the lion’s throne occurred when spirit congealed within the chamber, moving from non-being to being. Now, the pearl suspended in the Void Mystery transcends spirit beyond things, passing from being into non-being. All these are the Heavenly Worthy’s manifestations of wondrous transformation, revealing that within the most refined and subtle, the most wondrous Dao abides.\n\nThe Primordial Beginning then summoned the Heavenly Perfected, the Great Spirits, the Lofty Worthies, the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct, the Boundless Perfected Great Spirits of the Ten Directions, and the innumerable hosts—all entered into the precious pearl. Heavenly beings gazed upward and saw them bustling in through the pearl’s mouth; once inside, their whereabouts were unknown. The people of the land dispersed, and the earth returned to levelness, no longer sunken or slanted.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy suspended the precious pearl within the Void Mystery, summoning the Three Origins and Nine Sages, the Five Elders and Nine Perfected, the Heavenly Perfected Great Spirits, and the innumerable hosts—all entered the pearl. The heavenly beings gazed upward and saw them within the Void Mystery, within the Five Luminances, amid a hundred million rays of light. They saw them bustling in through the pearl’s mouth, yet once inside, the realm of the Void Mystery vanished from sight. Thus their whereabouts were unknown. The people of the land also dispersed in silence, and the earth became level, no longer sunken or slanted.\n\nThose who were not Heavenly Perfected or Lofty Worthies could not enter the wondrousness of the Void Mystery, only gaze upward in reverence. As for the Boundless Perfected Great Spirits of the Ten Directions and the innumerable hosts—all entered. Were these not heavenly beings?\n\nWhen one’s heart-pearl is luminous and clear, qi merges with spirit in darkness, gathering the myriad into one, then the innumerable hosts all enter through the mouth of one’s pearl. The six roots become still and silent, the solitary true emerges—how could any slant or sinking fail to return to levelness?\n\nWithin the precious pearl, the Primordial Beginning then expounded the scripture in full. The Perfected oversaw the transmission, bestowing it upon me. At that moment, joy and celebration defied words. The ritual matters were roughly complete, the myriad heavens returned to their positions, and in an instant, all was silent without lingering resonance.\n\nWithin the precious pearl, the Primordial Beginning finished expounding the scripture. The Perfected attended in vigil, and the transmission was conferred upon the Dao Lord. At that time, the Dao Lord’s joy and celebration defied words, beyond all naming or description. The ritual matters of the innumerable hosts were also complete, and the Perfected of the heavens all returned to their domains. Within the land, all was suddenly tranquil and still, silent without lingering resonance.\n\nWithin, the primordial spirit; at the center, a single qi; blending and fusing the nine apertures; illuminating the Golden Mother; gathering and refining cinnabar and mercury, returning them to the crucible. At this stage of practice, joy defies words. A moment’s work is complete, the myriad spirits return to their origin. In the dim and mysterious stillness, the image of the precious pearl also returns to the Ultimate Non-Being.\n\nAt that time, the heavenly beings who encountered the scripture’s teachings were universally delivered and saved, preserving their natural lifespans without premature harm. The entire land turned in devotion, all cultivating good hearts: no killing, no harm, no envy, no jealousy, no licentiousness, no theft, no greed, no desire, no hatred, no [lacuna]. Words were free of ornate embellishment, speech free of evil sounds. Equal in compassion and love, even those of different bones became kin. The land was at peace, the people prosperous, rejoicing in great harmony.\n\nAfter the Heavenly Worthy finished expounding the scripture and the heavens returned to their positions, all who heard the teachings were universally delivered and saved, preserving their natural lifespans without premature harm along the way. They all turned in devotion to the scripture’s teachings, swiftly cultivating good hearts. All killing and harm, envy and jealousy, licentiousness and theft, greed and desire, hatred and [lacuna], ornate words and evil speech were entirely purified. Thus, with compassion and love as one body, even those of different bones became kin. The land was at peace, the people prosperous, and all rejoiced in the image of great harmony.\n\nHuman nature is without exception good; its lack of goodness arises from being obscured by material desires and drowned in habitual qi. Thus, indulgence in depravity and excess flows unchecked, leading inevitably to harm of one’s natural lifespan. If one only pursues the hearts of killing and harm, envy and jealousy, licentiousness and theft, greed and desire, how can one know that the people are my siblings and all things share my qi? Approaching them with compassion and love, how could the land be at peace, the people prosperous, and all enjoy great harmony?\n\nThis is certainly what cultivators must guard against. Having heard the scripture’s teachings, one gathers the heart and congeals the spirit, taking self-cultivation and delivering others as the foundation. Over time, returning to the root and restoring life, emotions darken and nature becomes still—then one may hope for longevity and enduring vision. By restraining anger and blocking desires, governing emptiness and guarding stillness, diminishing again and again, in movement and stillness, speech and silence, there is nothing that is not good—then one will surely be able to refrain from killing and harm, licentiousness and theft.\n\nWhy then should there be extravagant adornments or harsh sounds? At this stage, all creatures—whether creeping, flying, or hidden—are embraced with compassion, without distinction of near or far. The state is like the body: when one harmonizes with the primordial qi, all things are nurtured. Even in assisting transformation and fostering life, or subtly supporting the imperial destiny, all arises from within.\n\nThus, governing the state in great peace and securing the realm of prosperous tranquility is achieved. When the scripture first emerged to teach a single nation, those who held the Dao with utmost sincerity, revered and honored its rites, all attained deliverance across the world. This speaks of the Heavenly Worthy’s initial proclamation of the scripture. When the people of a nation all follow the Dao in conduct, the teachings are thereby established.\n\nThe heart is the luminous clarity from kalpas past; though the teachings had not yet appeared, this heart was already complete—this is called \"preexisting.\" Yet, mired in illusion and delusion, it became obscured and lost. Now, through the deliverance of the scripture’s method, sudden awakening and liberation occur, nature returns to life, and destiny is restored. Once one follows the Dao in conduct, all delusions revert to truth.\n\n\"Revering and honoring\" means taking the source as fundamental. Like water flowing to the sea, all returns to its origin. \"Honoring with rites\" signifies profound reverence and faith. Thus, all attain deliverance across the world. If one forgets the root and chases the branches, abandons the source to seek the stream, how can one achieve deliverance?\n\nThe scripture is the path of the Dao; the heart is the Dao’s source. By aligning with the scripture and gathering the heart, one grasps the scripture’s subtleties.\n\nThe Dao states: The words spoken by the Primordial Heavenly Worthy in the scripture are the hidden rhymes of the inner names of the Heavenly Emperors, as well as the secret taboos of demon kings and the concealed names of the hundred spirits—these are not ordinary worldly terms.\n\nThe inner names of the Heavenly Emperors refer to the names of the Thirty-Two Heavens. The imperial taboos are the inner sounds of the Jade Characters of the Heavenly Emperors. The hidden rhymes are the natural numinous verses of the heavens, as mentioned in the scripture. The inner taboos of the demon kings refer to the Five Heavenly Demon Kings: Ba, Yuan, Chou, and Bo. The hidden names of the hundred spirits include Wu Ying, Bai Yuan, Tao Kang, and He Yan. All these were proclaimed by the Heavenly Worthy and transmitted by the Dao Lord—beyond the knowledge of worldly mortals.\n\nTurning inward to seek, as in the alchemical classics: solar essence and lunar spirit, Metal Tiger and Wood Dragon, mercury and cinnabar, red lead and black tin, yellow sprout and white snow, the maiden and the infant, the yellow matron and the golden lord, yang fire and yin tally, the mysterious pass and the earthen cauldron, the furnace and the trigrams—though their names and designations vary, they are but the primordial true unity of qi, the ancestral elixir. Without a master’s guidance, how could the foolish comprehend?\n\nThe perfected sages, having attained realization, penetrate the profound and exhaust the subtle, mastering all its verses. Reciting it ten times, the heavens echo from afar, and the myriad emperors pay homage. Rivers and seas grow still, mountains and peaks conceal their clouds. The sun and moon pause their radiance, the celestial pivot ceases its turning. Demon hosts bind their forms, ghostly spirits lose their clarity. The dead revive, white bones become flesh—this describes the efficacy of the perfected one’s recitation.\n\nThe \"perfected sages\" refer to the lofty immortals of the heavens, whose wondrous practices and sacred merits are already complete, requiring no further cultivation. The \"perfected ones\" achieve this through diligent practice, refining spirit and nurturing qi, ultimately merging with the natural—transcending being and non-being, forever escaping birth and death. Having thoroughly investigated the profound and awakened to the obscure, they fully grasp the scripture’s mysteries, such as the *Hun Dun Chi Wen* and the *Five Falling Scripts*.\n\nHaving mastered these, reciting it ten times summons the descent of the heavens, the observation of the myriad emperors, all echoing the jade sounds and honoring the inner taboos. None fail to revere the scripture’s intent and praise its merit. Thus, rivers and seas halt their waves, mountains and peaks withdraw their mists, the sun and moon pause their wheels, and the stars cease their radiance. Demon hosts retreat, ghostly spirits and demons hide—all effects of recitation, eliciting such great responses. Even the dead revive, white bones become flesh; though souls and spirits may have perished, they are reborn through the scripture’s power.\n\nThe efficacy of ten recitations in the alchemical path corresponds to the ten months of gestation, when the spirit is transformed.\n\nThe \"heavens\" here signify the inner fusion of true lead, with all spirits in harmony. The \"rivers, seas, mountains, and peaks\" represent the river of love and the sea of desire. If one’s singular truth is revealed, all illusions dissolve—then the waves of the river of love subside, and the billows of the sea of suffering grow calm. The \"sun, moon, and celestial pivot\" signify the great samadhi’s divine light, illuminating the eight consciousnesses—thus, external demons submit, and inner demons vanish. At this stage, the living body is delivered, and the dead soul is refined—how could there be no power to revive the dead?\n\nFor the devoted scholar who recites it ten times, the Five Emperors stand guard, the Three Realms bow in reverence, demonic spirits lose their sight, ghostly beings vanish, and those on the brink of death are delivered to new life—this describes the efficacy of the devoted scholar’s recitation.\n\n\"Devoted scholars\" are those of utmost dedication in their studies. The immortal master said: The devoted scholar’s heart is firm as iron and stone, their resolve unyielding in water or fire—beyond the reach of heaven and earth, unshaken by ghosts or spirits. They practice what others cannot, unwavering in their efforts. Thus, reciting the scripture ten times, the spirits of the five qi stand guard, the Three Realms heed their command, and even demon kings bow in submission and vouch for them.\n\nThis is the result of the devoted scholar’s accumulated merit and established deeds. In subduing demons, demonic spirits cower and dare not meet their gaze—thus, they lose their sight. With demon kings vouching for them, ghostly beings and demons bind their forms and vanish. Through this, those on the verge of death are delivered and revived.\n\nTurning inward: the Five Emperors are the spirits of the five viscera; the Three Realms are the three corpses, the six thieves; demonic spirits and ghostly beings are the seven emotions and six desires. If one can dispel desires and calm the heart, reducing thoughts and curbing cravings, then the heart grows still, the spirit clear, essence complete, and qi firm. The five viscera find peace, the three corpses are eradicated, the six roots purified, and all thoughts dissolve into emptiness.\n\nWhen inner demons are stilled, outer demons naturally disperse. Through the work of refining the self, one delivers those on the brink of death—where true qi reaches, even the lifeless may revive. This is the response of the ten transgressions within the body as the foundation of the elixir gradually takes form.\n\nThe reason for this lies in the fact that the scholar’s impure qi has not yet dissipated, and their body has not attained thorough realization. Though they summon and command the ten directions, their power is not yet sufficient to govern the celestial administration, yet their virtue may subdue and restrain the earthly deities, binding demonic spirits. However, they can only avert death, not restore life. This describes the ordinary practitioner whose efforts in cultivation and recitation have not yet reached fruition.\n\nThe celestial administration refers to the sun, moon, and five planets—collectively known as the Seven Governors. The earthly deities are the spirits of mountains, rivers, shrines, and altars. Ordinary practitioners, unable to diminish desires and clarify the heart, remain burdened by impure qi, their nature and principle still obscured; thus, their bodies and natures cannot attain thorough realization. The reason for this is their inability.\n\nFor those of advanced learning, whose cultivation and recitation have reached efficacy: though they summon and command the deities of the ten directions, their power may not yet move the celestial administration, yet their virtue can suppress and master the earthly deities, capturing and subduing demonic spirits. This is sufficient to avert death and prolong life, but not yet to attain the Dao of immortality. For their spirit is dull, their qi turbid, their substance impure, and their thoughts deluded. Though they may perform rites to shield against eclipses, avert the five planets, sever inauspicious stars, quell droughts and floods, slay dragons and mirages, summon rain and snow, or recede tides—any matter concerning the celestial administration—they cannot control its responses. The earthly deities, not yet having verified their celestial rank, can only be subdued by their virtue.\n\nIf the scholar’s cultivation and recitation are earnest, not a single thought arises, and all entanglements instantly cease, directly attaining the realm of the precious pearl—is this not thorough realization? To recite this chapter lightly brings misfortune. Through reverent offering and worship, one’s household flourishes, prosperity endures across generations, and good karmic conditions arise. Ten thousand calamities do not intrude, and divine spirits guard the gate. This warns of the consequences for ordinary learners who neglect their practice.\n\nTo recite this chapter lightly is to profane the scripture woven from the three heavens’ celestial qi, its cloud-seal dragon-script not of this world’s common speech. If one recites it carelessly, the offense of disrespect will surely invite misfortune. Even for the Three Caverns’ scriptures, one must gather the heart and focus the spirit, reciting without negligence—how much more so for this text?\n\nThus, Xue Youqi said: Without aligning the body, without following the rites, reciting while standing or sitting improperly—this is irreverence. To recite without reverence is worse than not reciting at all.\n\nMaster Xin admonished: At the outset of recitation, gather all thoughts into one—this is the Primordial Beginning’s summoning of the ten directions. To recite with right mindfulness is the Primordial Beginning’s expounding of the scripture. When the mind of emotions and perceptions does not wander, it is the ten directions listening to the teaching. When all delusions return to truth, it is the heavens and humans receiving deliverance. This teaching is perfect.\n\nFor ordinary learners who cultivate with sincerity, offer reverent worship, and observe utmost respect, their households will prosper outwardly, and their bodies and minds will find peace inwardly. Across generations, their prosperity will endure without cease. With the utmost accumulation of good deeds, every action aligns with fortune; disasters do not strike, and evil retreats. They will surely feel the protection of divine spirits.\n\nThis scripture is most venerable, unmatched in the Jade Capital. It delivers countless beings and is the root of all Dao. Its majestic model and virtue are beyond measure. *The sound ascends.*\n\nMaster Xin said: Great is the *Scripture of Salvation*! It is not composed by mere writing. Though all scriptures may perish when kalpas end, only this text remains in the Jade Capital.\n\nHe also said: From ancient times to the present, no sage, immortal, or buddha has attained the Dao without upholding the methods of the *Scripture of Salvation*. Among all scriptures, the *Primordial Beginning’s Scripture of Salvation* is the supreme text.\n\nFor since the Primordial Beginning first generated the heavens at the dawn of the kalpa, its Crimson Writ of Chaos and Numinous Chapters of the Void have illumined the Three Luminaries, encompassed the ten directions, unfolded the Five Scripts, and expanded the myriad models. The birth of heaven and earth, the nurturing of the ten thousand things—all arise from this as the root of heaven and earth. It can summon countless celestial perfected beings, innumerable hosts, all entering within a single grain of millet. Thus, it is the root of all Dao, the boundless, universally delivering without end. Therefore, it is most exalted and wondrous, uniquely the supreme scripture of the Jade Capital. Its majestic virtue cannot be fully recorded.\n\nThis scripture is the path by which a thousand perfected beings and ten thousand sages cultivate; from it emerge a thousand methods and ten thousand gates. Thus, it endures through ancient and modern times without decay, existing before heaven and earth. When expanded, it fills the six directions; when gathered, it does not exceed a handful. This is what the Buddhists mean when they say that the infinite worlds and boundless wondrous meanings are all contained within the tip of a hair. There is no other reason: it is the original true nature from before the beginning of kalpas. How could it not be most exalted and wondrous?\n\nThus, its boundless and infinite greatness and virtue cannot be limited or fully described. If one cultivates it, how could they not stand unmatched in the Jade Capital?\n\nMaster Xin says: The scripture is transmitted through the heart and realized through the heart—students should naturally examine it with discerning eyes to its ultimate meaning.\n\nThe Dao teaches: Whoever recites this scripture ten times will summon all the celestial beings; the suffering souls of their countless ancestors and departed kin in the dark realms will all be delivered, ascending to the Crimson Palace. After nine years of refinement, they will be transformed and reborn as noble persons. Those who diligently study the scripture, accumulating merit until their virtue is complete, will all attain immortality, ascending to the Golden Gates and roaming the Jade Capital.\n\nThis teaching is not limited by one’s station or worth—merely reciting it ten times can bestow the merit of delivering one’s ancestors and departed kin. \"Countless ancestors\" refers to all parents from the beginning of kalpas, the progenitors of innumerable lives and eons. \"Suffering souls\" are those trapped in the long night of the underworld, yet to be delivered. The Crimson Palace is the Southern Palace of Nanchang. The Vermilion Mound is the Fire Bureau.\n\nRefinement follows three grades: the superior student achieves deliverance in three years, the middling in nine, and the lesser in twenty-four. The merit of recitation is not bound by one’s capacity or wisdom—if one can focus the mind and recite it ten times, the power of the scripture will summon the descent of all celestial beings and the arrival of myriad spirits. One’s countless ancestors and the suffering souls of others will all be delivered, ascending to the Crimson Palace, instantly transformed by the scripture’s power. They will be reborn through the middling grade of refinement, becoming noble persons, born into noble families and spared from descent into lower realms.\n\nHaving attained rebirth, their innate spiritual awakening will be further cultivated through accumulated merit, and only then will they ascend to the three divine realms. Thus, those who persist in diligent study and recitation, accumulating merit day by day and month by month until their virtue is complete, will secure their spirit with the Jade Talisman and refine their form with the Golden Elixir. Over time, both form and spirit will attain perfection, and they will serve the Golden Gates and Jade Capital.\n\nSuperior students who recite this scripture will be delivered immediately, ascending to the Southern Palace. The Most High said: \"The superior person, upon hearing the Dao, diligently practices it.\" For superior students, who have planted good roots in past lives, their cultivation and recitation are unwavering from beginning to end. Their ceaseless progress and profound merit allow them to be delivered in their present form, preserving their life and rooting their existence. Unbound by refinement grades, they ascend directly to the Southern Palace.\n\nMaster Youlou says: When the hun and po ascend as immortals, the ghostly substance is refined by fire; when one is delivered in their present form, the filth of the body is refined by fire. Thus, those who practice diligently have their names recorded in the immortal registers, all ascending in spirit to the Southern Palace before attaining perfection—this is assuredly not difficult.\n\nFor ordinary mortals who recite the scripture, it extends their lifespan and grants long years; after death, they attain the way of *shijie*, their souls temporarily extinguished yet spared from hell, swiftly regaining form and roaming the great void. This describes the effects of recitation for common people. Those of ordinary station who recite it over time, silently comprehending its essence, may prolong their vitality and extend their years. After their bodies perish, they too attain *shijie*. Though their souls temporarily dissolve, their accumulated good karma ensures they avoid the suffering of hell, swiftly regaining form in the great void, their spirits delivered to the Vermilion Mound.\n\nAll this is granted by the blessings of past lives. Though mortals may recite with sincerity, without understanding the principles of refinement, they can only attain a long lifespan. When their allotted time ends, they still return to the cycle of birth and death. If their form attains *shijie*, their spirit escapes the wheel of rebirth, unbound by the underworld’s dark realms. Shedding their form and traces, they restore their true nature within the yin qi, their spirit transcending the empty vastness to roam the celestial realms.\n\nThis scripture is wondrous and subtle, universally delivering boundless beings—all celestial and human realms receive its blessings. Its immeasurable fortune extends even to the dead. The earlier praise of its exalted subtlety is now reiterated. The Dao Lord’s compassion is boundless, hence its infinite power of deliverance. Those who cultivate it with devotion, through the scripture’s merit, bring blessings to all celestial and human beings, even delivering the suffering souls of ancestors. Its boundless fortune is limitless, benefiting both the living and the dead. Once delivered, even the souls of the deceased undergo refinement—thus, both life and death receive the Heavenly Worthy’s grace.\n\nYet the scripture’s subtlety is inherent in all; without personal cultivation and the tenfold refinement of the self, how could it universally deliver all beings? If one can realize the scripture’s teachings in the heart and attain the subtlety of the Golden Elixir, over time, the tenfold spiritual revolutions will summon the ten directions. Then, even the distant departed will be liberated from their bodily forms, ascending to spiritual transformation—how could they not receive blessings in both life and death?\n\nHeaven treasures this scripture and does not transmit it to the lower world. Only the most devoted scholars, offering gold and treasures with sincere hearts, may swear an oath to heaven to receive it. Those who lightly disclose or profane it will bring calamity upon nine generations, condemned to eternal servitude as ghostly officials. The Dao Lord’s strict prohibitions reveal how this scripture is treasured and concealed in heaven.\n\nXiao Guanfu says: The Three Caverns’ true scriptures are recorded in the Golden Registers, hidden in the Mysterious Capital and revealed but once in ten thousand kalpas. In ancient times, when the kalpic fortunes were dire and the world’s paths obstructed, the Tortoise Mother of the Western Terrace petitioned the Jade Capital. Thereupon, the Jade Emperor Dao Lord entrusted it to the Perfected One of Primordial Unity; the Perfected One of Primordial Unity transmitted it to the Perfected One of the Great Ultimate, Xu; and the Perfected One of the Great Ultimate passed it to Master Ge Xuan, who disseminated it in the world. Thus, what heaven treasures and conceals is not something lesser scholars can comprehend.\n\nOnly the most devoted scholars—those of utmost learning—must offer gold and treasures to break their miserly hearts, deepening their reverence so they value the scripture as dearly as gold and jewels. Heaven’s treasures bear hidden names and secret taboos, written in vermilion script and cavernous chapters. The devoted scholar’s offerings of gold and treasures dispel stinginess and foster cherished devotion, ensuring they regard the scripture with the same love as precious treasures.\n\nShould one recklessly divulge, leak, or treat it with irreverence, how could one not bring calamity upon their ancestors and forebears, suffering interrogation by the ghostly officials?\n\nThe Perfected Master said: \"Recklessness\" means transmitting it to the unworthy; \"divulgence\" means practicing it without secrecy; \"leakage\" means failing to guard it steadfastly; \"irreverence\" means serving it without devotion. If any of these four occur, the body shall suffer calamity. The ghostly officials are those whom heaven dispatches as thunder-driving, lightning-summoning officers; earth assigns as sand-carrying, stone-bearing laborers; and water appoints as wave-drawing, abyssal attendants—where the souls of the dead are held accountable.\n\nWhen one receives this scripture, the Five Emperors assign twenty-four jade lads and twenty-four jade maidens to encamp and guard its divine writ, protecting the body of the recipient. This speaks of how the devoted scholar, through recitation and cultivation, invokes the protection of the Celestial Emperors and the Perfected Immortals.\n\nMaster Shaowei said: The Five Emperors are the Five Venerable Celestial Sovereigns. When the Five Emperors attend the scripture, they descend from the flying heavens to observe, commanding one hundred twenty jade lads and maidens to encamp and guard its writ, protecting the body of the one who wears and recites it. Most cultivators of the Dao are obstructed by external demons, easily wavering and retreating, so that many grow lax midway. Since the Perfected Lord has warned of the retribution for divulgence and irreverence—issuing stern admonitions—He also entrusts divine spirits to encamp and guard the sacred writ, protecting the recipient, thereby dispelling demons and warding off misfortune. The Heavenly Worthy’s compassion is truly all-encompassing. How can scholars of cultivation fail to embody His teachings, faithfully receive, uphold, and maintain them, avoiding the fault of divulgence and irreverence?\n\nThe Dao declares: In the first month, observe a prolonged fast and recite this scripture to sever the earthly bonds of past generations’ souls, releasing them from the toils of the underworld and ascending them to the Southern Palace. In the seventh month, observe a prolonged fast and recite this scripture to attain immortality, inscribing one’s name in the registers of the heavens—yellow writs and white tablets—erasing death and ascending to life. In the tenth month, observe a prolonged fast and recite this scripture to secure the peace of kings, emperors, rulers, ministers, fathers, and sons, stabilizing the nation’s destiny and ensuring the heavens endure eternally. Generation after generation, one shall remain a sovereign, bringing tranquility to the realm and its people, who shall praise it as a reign of great peace.\n\nThis speaks of the efficacy of recitation and cultivation on the Three Origins, the Eight Nodal Days, and one’s own life-destiny day. The first month’s Upper Origin is a month of great celebration, the first of the four beginnings, when the Builder of the Yin (Tiger) governs the ghostly path. Thus, one should recite to deliver the souls of past generations, severing the bonds of earthly officials and releasing them from the toils of ghostly labor, ascending them to the Southern Palace. The seventh month’s Middle Origin is a month of great celebration, when the Builder of the Yang (Monkey) governs the human path. Thus, one should recite to deliver oneself, inscribing one’s name in the heavenly registers, transcending death and ascending to life, recorded upon yellow writs and white tablets.\n\nMaster Shaowei said: These are the celestial records of immortals. The tenth month’s Lower Origin is a month of great celebration, when the Builder of the Celestial Gate (Boar) governs. One should then recite to protect kings, emperors, rulers, ministers, fathers, and sons, ensuring the nation’s peace, its destiny enduring, and its sovereignty unbroken through generations. The realm shall be tranquil, free from plague and pestilence, and the people shall extol it as a reign of great peace. For the Three Origins govern the Three Palaces, the Nine Bureaus, and the one hundred twenty offices, which examine and tally sins and blessings, all under their jurisdiction. Thus, for the nation’s destiny first, then one’s ancestors, and finally oneself, one should observe a prolonged fast and recite the scripture during these months, praying for blessings and deliverance. Heaven and earth shall rejoice, the living and the dead shall receive grace, and boundless blessings shall be attained.\n\nOn the Eight Nodal Days, reciting this scripture enables one to become a Perfected One of the Nine Palaces. On one’s life-destiny day, reciting this scripture purifies the hun-soul and spirit, ensuring the eternal preservation of the ten thousand qi, sparing one from suffering and affliction, and endowing the body with radiant light. The Three Realms shall attend and guard, the Five Emperors shall await and welcome, the ten thousand spirits shall pay homage, one’s name shall be inscribed in heaven, and upon the fulfillment of merit and virtue, one shall ascend to the Upper Clarity.\n\nThe Eight Nodal Days—four commencements marking the start of the seasons and the two equinoxes and solstices as the transitions of yin and yang—are when the Three Realms examine and tally sins and blessings, as recorded in the immortal scriptures. It is said: On these days, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy dispatches Celestial Emperors, Heavenly Lords, divine immortals, and legions of spirit-soldiers to transform and deliver all beings in the human realm. The Northern Dipper, the Southern Bureau, the Four Offices, and the Five Emperors also descend to record sins and blessings. All beings imbued with qi undergo transformation on these days—flying, walking, creeping, and wriggling creatures, those of water and land, those that soar and sink—responding to karmic conditions, altering the old and embracing the new. What was light may become heavy, what was heavy may become light; good and evil may reverse, and the workings of qi and phenomena unfold naturally. Scholars of the Dao should on these days cultivate sincerity, offer prayers of gratitude, adapt to change, rectify conduct, abandon falsehood for truth, deliver all beings, and nurture the ten thousand things. Thus, they should recite, uphold, and revere the scripture, striving to cultivate fortune and dispel misfortune, advance goodness and cast out evil, pursue brightness and forsake darkness, rouse their resolve to seek truth, inwardly accumulate true merit, and outwardly practice substantive deeds, thereby avoiding the retribution of sins and blessings.\n\nThe Eight Nodal Days correspond to the Eight Trigrams and the Nine Palaces; thus, reciting the scripture on these days enables one to become a Perfected One of the Nine Palaces. One’s life-destiny day occurs six times each year when the descent occurs. The three hun-souls reside in the liver, belonging to wood, and their number is three—hence the three hun-souls. The seven po-souls reside in the lungs, belonging to metal, and their number is seven—hence the seven po-souls. Of the three hun-souls in the human body, one dwells in the original constellation’s palace, one in the underworld, and one within the physical form. The seven po-souls constantly depart yet do not scatter. On one’s life-destiny day, the hun-souls descend into the body to join the corpse, circulating and returning without cease, ensuring the person’s peace and stability, free from disaster and illness. If on this day one purifies body and mind, abstains from wine and lust, wears clean garments, burns incense, and cultivates goodness, and further, rests briefly, then the hun and po shall unite, yin and yang shall harmonize, the Dao-qi shall flourish within, and the root of life shall be firmly established.\n\nIf one indulges in wine and lust, confounding and disordering the physical form, then when the hun-souls return, they halt three paces from the body, unable to unite. Foul qi fills the frame, and the hun-souls, returning again, are thrice confounded by disorder. Failing to join the po-souls, yang wanes while yin waxes, and the hun-souls commune with yin spirits, giving rise to night-wandering in evil dreams, deep slumber and confusion, and the onset of disaster and illness.\n\nShould one on their life-destiny day perform purification rites and recite scriptures, the above-mentioned responses shall manifest. When merit is fulfilled and virtue perfected, the Three Realms shall provide escort, the Five Emperors shall officiate the reception, and one shall await ascension.\n\nThe Azure Prime declares: When a person commits myriad evils, the hun-souls grow wrathful and the divine spirits depart the body, knowing they shall together enter the evil paths. When one performs all manner of good, the hun-souls rejoice and the hundred spirits gather, knowing they shall together enter the true path. Those who cultivate learning—can they not be cautious?\n\nThe Dao states: On the day of practicing the Way, one should bathe in fragrant waters, fast, enter the chamber, face east, and knock the teeth thirty-two times to ascend the report to the thirty-two heavens, bowing in the heart thirty-two times. Closing the eyes and settling the mind, one sits amidst clouds of green, yellow, and white qi, both within and without shrouded in mist. Green dragons, white tigers, vermilion birds, dark warriors, lions, and white cranes array themselves to left and right. Sun and moon illuminate the chamber, its interior radiant, while atop the head a circular image forms, its light suffusing the ten directions—all vividly present.\n\nOn days of scripture recitation, one should first don ritual attire, wash the hands and rinse the mouth, purify the heart and still the thoughts, enter the chamber, sit facing east, and recite with focused mind and measured gaze. The voice should be soft, ensuring harmony of spirit and soul, qi settled and breath regulated. Then knock the teeth to summon the spirits within and reach the heart of heaven without. Bow to the thirty-two heavens, close the eyes and inwardly visualize, sitting amidst the primal three qi of the Mysterious Origin. Within and without radiant, one visualizes green qi from the liver emerging through the eyes, transforming into a green dragon on the left; white qi from the lungs issuing from the nose, becoming a white tiger on the right; red qi from the heart flowing from the mouth, forming a vermilion bird before; and black qi from the kidneys passing through the ears, manifesting as a dark warrior behind—all arrayed to left and right. The left eye aligns with the sun, the right with the moon, their light illuminating the chamber. Atop the neck, a circular image of nine colors emits rays, its brilliance enveloping the ten directions.\n\nThe *mizhou* states:\n*Mi* means \"low voice,\" and *zhou* means \"prayer.\" Master Moyin says: From \"Supreme Mysterious Origin\" below to \"before the Most Honored One’s seat,\" this is the whispered prayer, and no separate incantation need be recited. The *Tanluo Yuluo* are later additions—how could they be fitting to recite? Moreover, one must not proceed too swiftly, lest in haste to complete the count, the qi grows turbid and the voice clamorous, turning reverence into irreverence.\n\nSupreme Mysterious Origin, Most High Dao Lord, summon forth from within my body the Three-and-Five Merit Officers, the left and right attending messengers, the incense-bearing golden youths, the jade maidens who transmit words, the Five Emperors’ direct talismans, and the incense officials of the day—thirty-two of each—let them emerge to report my words. Today is an auspicious day, a day of prolonged fasting and pure hall, of cultivating the supreme scripture to deliver boundless beings. I, [Name], recite this scripture for rebirth, praying that this report ascend directly to the Most High, before the seat of the Primordial Lord of the Thirty-Two Heavens.\n\nUpon completion, draw qi thirty-two times and face east to recite the scripture.\n\nThe Supreme Mysterious Origin is the collective term for the Three Realms. As the recitation is dedicated to the Primordial Origin, one first invokes the Dao Lord, visualizing him within the *niwan* palace atop one’s head. The Three-and-Five Merit Officers and other spirits within the body are visualized emerging and arraying themselves to left and right, front and back—one for each heaven, thirty-two in all—each reporting in turn. The report’s content should align with the prayer, sincerely stating the matter. \"Today is an auspicious day of prolonged fasting\": today is [specific day], an auspicious day; if not a prolonged fast, simply say \"a day of fasting.\" \"Pure hall, cultivating the supreme scripture\": if one is not versed in the covenants of the Three Caverns and has not practiced regularly, merely say \"pure hall, reciting the scripture.\" \"Delivering boundless beings\" refers to the ten directions, seen and unseen; if reciting for a specific matter, say \"reciting the scripture for [matter].\" \"I, [Name]\": omit if for oneself; omit if for another. \"Directly before the seat of the Primordial Lord of the Thirty-Two Heavens\" refers to the thirty-two Heavenly Emperors and the Primordial Lord’s seat. Drawing qi thirty-two times likewise entails one breath for each heaven. Facing east signifies the beginning of generative qi. With the three qi within and without luminous, recite according to the method.\n\n*Exegesis on the Supreme Primordial Wondrous Scripture of Limitless Salvation, Scroll the First, Concluded*\n*Exegesis on the Supreme Primordial Wondrous Scripture of Limitless Salvation, Scroll the Second*\n\n**The Orthodox Unity Lineage of the Dao, Transmitted Teachings of the Dao Merged with Non-Action, Illustrious Ancestor and Model of Radiance, Perfected Zhang, Forty-Third Celestial Master Zhang Yuchu, Annotator**\n\n*The Supreme Primordial Wondrous Scripture of Limitless Salvation* – this is the title of the true scripture.\n\nThe true scripture was spoken by the Primordial, hence it is simply titled *The Supreme Primordial Wondrous Scripture of Limitless Salvation*. This is the title placed by the Dao Lord at the scripture’s beginning. \"Primordial\" clarifies that this scripture was spoken by the Primordial Heavenly Worthy. \"Limitless salvation of beings\" encapsulates the scripture’s fundamental purpose. As this scripture holds the highest rank among all scriptures, it is called *The Supreme Wondrous Scripture*.\n\n*Primordial Cavern-Mystery, Numinous Treasure Original Chapter*:\n\"Primordial\" is the origin of the One Qi, the beginning of the myriad transformations, the title of the Heavenly Worthy of the Primordial Void in response to the world. Prefacing the original chapter with \"Primordial\" clarifies that all is the speech of the Primordial Heavenly Worthy. \"Cavern-Mystery\" is one of the Three Caverns, a designation for scriptural ranks. \"Numinous Treasure\" is the title of the Dao Lord. The Dao Lord names the scriptural treasure, for all scriptures are expounded by the Dao Lord. The Treasures of Dao, Scripture, and Master existed prior to heaven and earth, all transformed and born from the Three Qi of the Mysterious Primordial. Thus, this scripture was also formed from the Three Qi of Brahma-Purity and Radiant Scenery, condensed into cloud-seal celestial chapters, which the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign then transcribed into scriptural text.\n\nThe Primordial abides within the empty cavern of the mysterious void, speaking this scripture, which is the root of all Numinous Treasure scriptures and stands at their head, hence called the *Original Chapter*. Cultivated internally, it is another name for the Great Elixir of Golden Liquor. Congealing spirit as numinosity, gathering qi as treasure, the roots and dust thoroughly illumine one’s primordial spirit, enduring through past and present without decay—this is the original foundation of the precelestial True One.\n\n*Supreme wondrous beginning, ten revolutions to save beings; a hundred demons conceal their rhymes, separation and union arise naturally.*\n\nMò’ān says: This is the brief preface to the true scripture. \"Supreme wondrous beginning\" refers to the highest rank among scriptures, the foremost of all wonders. \"Ten revolutions to save beings\": ten is the generative and completive number of the Five Phases, a principle inherent in all things. To save humans or spirits, one must revolve ten times, cycling endlessly, and only then does the spirit achieve tenfold reversion. \"A hundred demons’ virtuous rhymes\": Shǎowēi says: \"Demons\" here are not malevolent demons or demonic ghosts. They include the Great Demons of the Five Emperors, the South Pole’s Longevity and World-Saving Sīmǎ, and other deities. Thus, in the Numinous Treasure incantations, the True Kings, Vermilion Numinosity, and Azure Radiance are all listed alongside the Great Demons of the Five Heavens. \"Concealed rhymes\" refer to hidden names and taboo terms. \"Separation and union arise naturally\": the sounds of concealed rhymes, now divided, now united, arise spontaneously without fixed traces.\n\nFor the precelestial One Qi transforms and generates the myriad beings—one root branching into ten thousand, this is union; ten thousand branching back to one root, this is separation. Revolving endlessly, cycling without beginning or end, the workings of creation cannot be discerned. In the Dao of the elixir, after ten months the embryo is complete, and the spirit transforms, following the same path as heaven and earth, sharing the same mechanism as creation—all taking ten as the complete number. In human cultivation, the greatest difficulty lies in the six roots, eight consciousnesses, three hun souls, seven po souls, and the gods of the three regions and eight landscapes. These, when stirred, become demonic trials, disturbing the sovereign heart, their separation and union in tumult, never resting. Once one knows the work of cultivating ten revolutions, the hundred demons are subdued, returning to the natural state.\n\n*Primal Chaos Red Writ, Non-None Supreme Perfected, Primordial Ancestral Kalpa, Transforming and Generating the Myriad Heavens, Illuminating the Three Radiant Sceneries—This is the Root of Heaven.*\n\nAbove, there is no further ancestor; only the Dao is the body.\n\nShǎowēi says: The section before \"naturally\" is the Dao Lord’s brief preface; from \"Primal Chaos\" onward is the Heavenly Worthy’s original chapter. \"Primal\" means undifferentiated chaos; \"Chaos\" means emptiness without substance. This refers to the time before the separation of Primal Chaos, when the One Qi was gestating within the empty cavern. \"Red Writ\": *The Scripture of the True Writ in Red* states: The Cavern-Yang Qi is red, hence it is called the Red Writ. All are the Qi of the precelestial and the essence of the utmost Yang, manifesting as images.\n\nThe Five Elder Thearchs say: The Primordial Cavern-Mystery Numinous Treasure Red Writ was born before the Primordial, within the empty cavern, in profound obscurity. Without ancestor or lineage, Qi congealed and floated in the void, responding to the moment and the occasion—this is it. \"Non-None Supreme Perfected\": the Qi originates from the beginning of the Great None. The scripture says: \"None, and even none is none.\" The most supreme of the supreme, the truest of the true—this is what is meant by \"born before heaven and earth.\" \"Ancestor\" refers to ancestral Qi. A kalpa is one formation and one dissolution of heaven and earth; the ancestral kalpa is the beginning of the world’s formation, before any dissolution has occurred. The Mysterious Primordial Qi is the ancestor of the myriad things. The Five Hundred Million Heavens are all transformed and generated from ancestral Qi. The scripture says: \"The Dao is the mother of the myriad things.\"\n\nXiāo Guānfù says: From the One Qi, the Three Realms are established; from the Three Realms, the Nine Heavens are born. Below each of the Three Realms, three heavens are generated, totaling thirty-six heavens. Below these are the Four Kinds of Human Heavens, then the Three Realms and Twenty-Eight Heavens, then the Eight Brahma Heavens, extending to the Five Hundred Million Heavens—all have ancestral Qi as their root.\n\n\"Illuminating the Three Radiant Sceneries\": The Three Realms are the Three Heavens of Pure Tenuity, Cosmic Resonance, and Great Vermilion. The Three Radiant Sceneries are also called the Three Lights: sun, moon, and stars. They are the Three Poles of heaven, earth, and humanity; the Three Powers; the Three Realms. The Most High says: The Dao generates the One—this is the One Qi. The One generates the Two—these are the Two Modes. The Two generate the myriad things—these are the Three Radiant Sceneries. The Three Qi combine to form the Nine Qi. The Three Qi are the ancestors of heaven and earth, the roots of the myriad things. All are transformed and generated from the ancestral kalpa, and only then are heaven and earth illuminated and born—this is the Root of Heaven.\n\nAbove, there is no further ancestor—only the Dao as its own body. The Dao takes emptiness and nothingness as its essence, and cannot be sought through form; this is called a forced name. Thus, it is without shape or name, without sound or scent, vast enough to embrace heaven and earth, capacious enough to encompass the cosmos. That which has no ancestor above it is the Dao. The Confucians call it the Supreme Ultimate; the Buddhists call it True Emptiness; the Daoists call it the Great Void—yet their principle is one.\n\nIn human cultivation, one gathers ancestral qi from the primordial beginning, coalescing it into the Golden Mother. Circulating through the Six Voids, it is the intermingling of the Two Qi, opening and closing without cease. Over time, one pursues the Two Qi along the Yellow Path, uniting the Three Natures in the Original Palace. Then the essence of the Two and Five exquisitely conjoins and congeals, generating endlessly to form the Dharmakāya—this is the primordial Heavenly Root.\n\nThe Five Scriptures unfold and expand, universally planting spiritual numina. Without scripture, there is no illumination; without scripture, there is no clarity; without scripture, there is no establishment; without scripture, there is no completion; without scripture, there is no deliverance; without scripture, there is no generation. This is the Heaven within the Great Brahmā Heaven. The Five Scriptures are the Five Chapters of True Writ, the very texts of the Five Chapters’ dissemination. From them, heaven is generated and earth is established; flying and hidden, moving and still, all creatures possessing consciousness—every being with form and qi—are transformed and born. Thus, since the division of yin and yang, their scriptures have unfolded and expanded, universally planting the ten thousand kinds.\n\nThe Five Scriptures in heaven become the Five Stars; on earth, the Five Peaks; in humanity, the Five Phases; in things, the Five Qi. No entity, from the vastest to the most minute, is not encompassed within them. Without these scriptures, there is no illumination or clarity, no establishment or completion, no deliverance or generation—then heaven and earth and the myriad things would have no mechanism for the workings of creation.\n\nThe human body is a small heaven and earth, yet more numinous than the myriad things. The primordial One Qi is the foundation of the elixir; the Five Phases are arrayed within the crucible. Metal and Wood intermingle; Water and Fire unite in harmony; the Two Earths serve as the regulator. Within this, yin and yang are inverted, and the Hexagram of Already Crossing is achieved. When emotion returns to nature, mercury is cast into lead; when the medicine meets fire, cinnabar is produced from silver—all with the Golden Mother as their root. Flowing from wù to jǐ, upon encountering Earth, the elixir is formed.\n\nOnce the elixir is complete, its spirit and numinous transformations are unfathomable—all is the full embodiment of the Five Phases. Its radiance is like the brilliance of the sun and moon; its establishment is like the founding of heaven and earth. That which can deliver and generate is the Primordial Beginning—this is the Heaven within the Great Brahmā Heaven, encapsulating the purport of the preceding scriptural passages, hence it is said to be so. The Great Brahmā is the Great Flowing Brahmā Qi. The Heaven within Heaven is the Heaven among the Thirty-Two Heavens—none is not pervaded by the flowing Brahmā Qi, circulating without cease, just as the One Qi within the body cycles endlessly. All is the flowing of the Mandate of Heaven, the hundred vessels and nine orifices—nowhere does it not return. This is the universal distribution of Brahmā Qi.\n\nYuluo Xiao Terrace, Jade Mountain’s Upper Capital—above, it reaches the utmost, the Great Luo of Jade Purity, vast and boundless through kalpas, now present, now absent. Above the Great Luo Heaven lies Jade Capital Mountain, a capital made of jade, hence called Jade Mountain’s Upper Capital. The Yuluo Terrace stands above the Jade Capital, reaching the highest and most distant—above even the utmost. This is the Heaven of the Great Luo. Within it dwells the Jade Purity Golden Gate, its vastness without limit, embracing the ten thousand realms. Thus, it is boundless through kalpas, impossible to exhaust. Yet the Brahmā Qi congeals in emptiness, not to be sought through form or image—this is called \"now present, now absent.\" For every formation and dissolution of heaven and earth is one kalpa. The realm of the Great Luo was inaugurated before the empty kalpas and remains unbroken through kalpas. *Rèn* cannot be measured or limited. Its vastness and indistinctness are one with the Great Void—without shape or name, not to be sought through traces.\n\nWithin the body, Yuluo Xiao Terrace is the region of the brain. Jade Mountain’s Upper Capital is the Mud Pill Palace. The Mud Pill is the Gate of Heaven, the mansion of the ten thousand spirits—this is the scene of the Great Luo, with Jade Purity dwelling within, vast and boundless through kalpas, now present, now absent. One’s true nature is vast and without sign, a thing within the indistinct—enduring through vast kalpas, the so-called indestructible primordial spirit. Thus, it resides above the Three Realms.\n\nThe Three Flowers depart and separate, the Great Possession’s Wondrous Court—Golden Gates and Jade Chambers, a forest of purity and limpid pools. The Great Flowing Brahmā Qi circulates through the ten directions. Master Youqi says: The Three Flowers are the Three Primordial Palaces of Jade Purity. The Upper Primordial Jade Flower, the Middle Primordial Golden Flower, the Lower Primordial Nine Flowers—here dwell the Three Primordial August Lords of the Dao, the detached palaces of Jade Purity. The Great Possession is the Highest Great Possession Jade Purity Palace, where the Heavenly Worthy presides, hence called the Wondrous Court. Three is the number of the south, the fire phase, belonging to *lí*—this is the Mud Pill region of the brain. The Golden Gates and Jade Chambers are the Crimson Palace of the Yellow Court. The forest of stars is the constellations of the celestial circuit. The limpid pools are the two ponds’ crystalline clarity—within the body, these are *kǎn* and *lí*. The Great Flowing Brahmā Qi circulating through the ten directions is the scene of the Great Luo and Jade Purity, the Brahmā Qi flowing universally through the boundless realms of the Ultimate Non-Existence. The ten thousand things all receive its moisture; the One Qi of the Primordial Beginning transforms and generates endlessly.\n\nThe Elixir Scriptures say: The Three Palaces merge and unite, gathering the Three Natures in the Original Palace. The body’s spirit, qi, and essence are the Three Flowers. The primordial spirit resides within the Numinous Terrace—this is the Wondrous Court of the Great Possession. My golden tower and jade chamber are the Golden Gates and Jade Chambers of heaven. The Five Stars and constellations, the forest of radiance within the limpid pool waters—this is the celestial fire time, the constellations and stars encircling the ascent and descent of *kǎn* and *lí*, water and fire. Within the Qian-Kun crucible, between the state of Already Crossing, the Way of the Ninefold Return of Golden Liquid is accomplished.\n\nThe Primordial True One Qi circulates day and night, cycling endlessly, all receiving the lunar essence of *kǎn*-*wù* and the solar radiance of *lí*-*jǐ*. In accordance with the advancing and retreating fire phases, through union and gentle nurturing, the Golden Embryo is formed. As it traverses the sixty-four hexagrams in full cycle, the hundred meridians return to the Origin, the nine orifices become luminously clear—is this not the pervasive circulation of the Brahman Qi, suffusing all ten directions, all becoming the scene of the limpid pool?\n\nWithin it abides the spirit that delivers people from death; within it dwells the Lord of Longevity of the Southern Culmen; within it resides the Great Divine Marshal who delivers the world; within it abides the Life-Nurturing Elder Han Jun; within it are the Lords of Destiny and Record of the Southern Upper Realm, who extend life and augment destiny, the Venerable Spirits who deliver from calamity—reanimating the bones and reviving the dead, delivering boundless multitudes.\n\nToday is the day of celestial reckoning, as the hosts of heaven descend in state.\n\nMò’ān says: This speaks of the assembled hosts of heaven, examining the merits and transgressions of scholars. The Master of Immortals says: The Brahman Qi circulates throughout the ten directions’ domains, and within these ten directions are deities who preside over the deliverance of the world from death—this does not mean the deities themselves are immortal.\n\nThe Lord of Longevity of the Southern Culmen is the Great Lord of Longevity of the Southern Culmen, who governs the Register of Life. It is also said: He is the Great Emperor of the Vermilion Mound. The Great Divine Marshal who delivers the world is the Great Divine Marshal of the Southern Palace, who presides over world-deliverance. The Life-Nurturing Elder Han Jun governs the Upper Palace of Southern Prosperity, overseeing the Register of Longevity. The Lords of Destiny and Record of the Southern Upper Realm, who extend life and augment destiny, and the Venerable Spirits who deliver from calamity—\"Southern Upper\" is another name for the Grotto-Yang Palace, also called the Upper Palace of Southern Prosperity or the Venerable Spirits of the Vermilion Mound Fire Mansion, namely the Six True Lords of the Southern Dipper. From \"within it abides the spirit that delivers people\" to the Southern Culmen’s various perfected ones, though each is assigned to a specific office, all possess the power to reanimate the bones and revive the dead, delivering people across kalpas without limit. Thus, world-deliverance is boundless.\n\nThe spirits within the body each reside within the Crimson Palace, the Mysterious Pass, and the Mud Pill Palace—hence it is said \"within it.\" The so-called Southern Culmen and Southern Prosperity are the heart. The scripture says: The boundless great spirits all arise from my own body. The adept who refines the Golden Liquid and tempers the form will thereafter attain the wondrous union of form and spirit, and may circulate through the ten directions, delivering the world, averting calamity, reanimating the bones, and reviving the dead.\n\n\"Today is the day of celestial reckoning\"—\"today\" refers to the first kalpa of the Red Clarity, the day of unfolding the register and reckoning in the Great Floating Li Land. It is the day of weighing transgressions and blessings, recording merits and faults, when the divine kings and great sages of the ten directions descend in state to assemble, heeding the Heavenly Worthy’s proclamation of deliverance.\n\nThe Boundless Flying Heavenly Divine King, Great Sage of Longevity, and Boundless Deliverer of the Eastern Direction;\nThe Boundless Flying Heavenly Divine King, Great Sage of Longevity, and Boundless Deliverer of the Southern Direction, Flying;\nThe Boundless Flying Heavenly Divine King, Great Sage of Longevity, and Boundless Deliverer of the Western Direction, Cloud;\nThe Boundless Flying Heavenly Divine King, Great Sage of Longevity, and Boundless Deliverer of the Northern Direction, Mirrorless;\nThe Boundless Flying Heavenly Divine King, Great Sage of Longevity, and Boundless Deliverer of the Northeastern Direction, Brahman;\nThe Boundless Flying Heavenly Divine King, Great Sage of Longevity, and Boundless Deliverer of the Southeastern Direction, Nāyu;\nThe Boundless Flying Heavenly Divine King, Great Sage of Longevity, and Boundless Deliverer of the Southwestern Direction, Delivering Immortals;\nThe Primordial Ultimate Flying Heavenly Divine King, Great Sage of Longevity, and Primordial Boundless Deliverer of the Northwestern Direction, Juéwú;\nThe Boundless Flying Heavenly Divine King, Great Sage of Longevity, and Boundless Deliverer of the Upper Direction, Ying;\nThe Boundless Flying Heavenly Divine King, Great Sage of Longevity, and Boundless Deliverer of the Lower Direction, Luo.\n\nThe Flying Heavenly Great Sages of the ten directions are all emanations of the Primordial Beginning’s Dao-realm, transformed through qi.\n\nBīnghú Xū Xiùzhāo says: The Great Sages of Longevity of the ten directions are the Heavenly Worthies of Salvation from Suffering of the ten directions. From the day of unfolding the register, they receive the Primordial Beginning’s mandate to oversee the reckoning of merits in the ten directions and three realms, delivering boundless multitudes, encompassing life and death, and refining adepts.\n\nThe *Daoist Canon* states: In the eight directions, all heavens contain boundless great-thousand worlds. The Boundless Heavens of the Eastern Direction contain the Great Thousand World of Āndà Tángxiāng, the Realm of Gathering Goodness; the Boundless Heavens of the Southern Direction contain the Great Thousand World of Wǎnlí Chéngjìng, the Realm of Abandoning the Worthy; the Boundless Heavens of the Western Direction contain the Great Thousand World of Fútáng Zhōu, the Realm of Universal Conduct; the Boundless Heavens of the Northern Direction contain the Great Thousand World of Yùdān Yě, the Realm of Purity; the Boundless Heavens of the Northeastern Direction contain the Great Thousand World of Fújídū, the Realm of Eternal Peace; the Boundless Heavens of the Southeastern Direction contain the Great Thousand World of Yuánfútián, the Realm of Primordial Goodness; the Boundless Heavens of the Southwestern Direction contain the Great Thousand World of Yánfú Xiāng, the Realm of the Seven Tranquilities; the Boundless Heavens of the Northwestern Direction contain the Great Thousand World of Fúdé Yě, the Realm of Extending the Worthy; the Upper Direction contains the Thirty-Six Heavens of the Upper Clarity Jade Perfection and the Boundless World of Xuándū; the Lower Direction contains the Thirty-Two Heavens of Huángzēng and the Eight Round Boundless Worlds.\n\nIt is also said: The hosts of the Five Marchmounts, the Five Emperors, the Grotto-Yin, the Pure Numinous, the Northern Capital, and the Luòfēng’s various offices—these Flying Heavenly Divine Kings of the ten directions all hold the office of bestowing longevity and delivering the world. Thus, they are called the Great Sages of Longevity. From kalpa to kalpa, they deliver people to attain the Dao and achieve perfection without limit—this is called the Boundless Deliverer of People.\n\nThe perfected Flying Heavenly Divine Kings of the ten directions, the boundless great spirits of longevity and world-deliverance, all ride upon flying clouds. Their cinnabar chariots and green canopies, jade wheels and feathered parasols, are drawn by vermilion phoenixes and five-colored dark dragons. They bear nine-colored standards and ten spirit-streamers of absolute purity. Ahead, nine phoenixes cry in unison; behind, eight simurghs sing in harmony. Lions and white cranes roar and chant in melodious chorus.\n\nAll these are the Flying Heavenly Divine Kings of the ten directions and the boundless great spirits—all are the perfected of heaven.\n\nQīngyuán says: Chariots, canopies, wheels, and parasols are all formed from the qi of yang essence; phoenixes, dragons, lions, and cranes are all transformations of the qi of yin essence. The supreme sages, possessing the Dao of true constancy, inhale and exhale, gather and disperse, manifesting at will. When the qi of yin and yang harmonize, songs and melodies arise—all are the work of qi, not external things.\n\nWhen the practice of returning the elixir reaches completion, the yin demons are also transformed. With a single breath of the yang spirit’s primordial qi, the ten thousand spirits all heed its call. The divine spirits of the five viscera each manifest in their directional colors. Chariots, brushes, and ceremonial escorts come to welcome the hundred bones, with the host of spirits leading and following, ascending to pay homage at the Origin—no different from the assembly of the Heavenly Perfected and Great Sages. The Five Elders clear the path, while the multitude of immortals flank the carriage, myriad chariots and ten thousand riders arriving upon the floating void.\n\nAs the radiant light pours forth and the celestial chariot turns back, they oversee the Perfected and deliver the living. The Great Sages of the ten directions, exalted in their Dao ranks, are thus moved to have the Five Emperors lead the way, with the throng of immortals as their attendants—hence the myriad chariots and ten thousand riders arrive upon the floating void, riding the luminous scenery.\n\nThe Five Elders are:\n- The Eastern Azure Spirit, First Elder, surnamed Guan, named Kai, styled Lingwei Yang;\n- The Southern Cinnabar Spirit, True Elder, surnamed Dongfu, named Jiyan, styled Chibiao Nu;\n- The Central Primordial Spirit, Primordial Elder, surnamed Tongban, named Yuanshi, styled Han Shuniu;\n- The Western Radiant Spirit, August Elder, surnamed Shangjin, named Changkai, styled Yaopo Bao;\n- The Northern Dark Spirit, Mysterious Elder, surnamed Heijie, named Linghui, styled Yin Houju.\n\nThe Five Emperors are all naturally divine Heavenly Perfected, transformed from the wondrous workings of the ancestral qi into the five phases—these are the five qi. Thus they are called the Primordial Five Elders, not those who attain Perfection through accumulated study. From the moment they receive their mandate and descend with their talismans, each presides over a direction. Only when the great kalpas cycle anew do their positions change.\n\nTherefore:\n- The East pertains to Wood, governing spring, commanding the birth of the myriad things;\n- The South pertains to Fire, governing summer, commanding the growth of the myriad things;\n- The Center pertains to Earth, flourishing in all four seasons, harmonizing the myriad things;\n- The West pertains to Metal, governing autumn, commanding the fruition of the myriad things;\n- The North pertains to Water, governing winter, commanding the storage of the myriad things.\n\nThis is what is meant by the orderly distribution of the five qi. The five phases are the upright qi of the Dharmakāya. The Fire Dragon and Water Tiger, in inverted flow, circulate within the crucible. When the ten thousand spirits gather in the Nine Palaces, the five qi pay homage at the Origin, and the hundred numina guard the body—just as the thousand chariots and ten thousand riders arrive upon the floating void.\n\nThe \"pouring light\" refers to the flowing essence of jade radiance. The \"turning chariot\" refers to the flying clouds of the cinnabar firmament. When the Great Sages of the ten directions assemble at the Emperor’s abode, their wheel hubs revolve, and the Heavenly Honored One’s dharma throne oversees the host of Perfected, examining and measuring the ranks of all beings.\n\nWithin, one turns the true light inward to illumine the numinous palace. When Kan and Li are conjoined, lead and mercury merge, the spirit does not stray outward, and the six reins are all stilled. Only then does the yang light pour downward, the yin dregs refine upward, and the true spirit transform and generate, naturally overseeing the Perfected and delivering the living, circulating through the ten directions.\n\nThe Chancellors of the Various Heavens, the Southern Palace of Supreme Prosperity, the Han Director of Records, and the Great Spirit Who Oversees Birth—all holding registers and ledgers—gather before the Emperor. According to those who ought to be delivered, they strictly examine the heavens. Mo’an says: This describes the assembly of the various heavens to review the merits and transgressions of scholars and the karmic fortunes of worldly people.\n\nThe Chancellors of the Various Heavens are the Divine Lords of the Great Ultimate of the Boundless. The Southern Palace of Supreme Prosperity is the Vermilion Numinous Fire Mansion, located in the Heaven of Radiant Harmony and Yang Brilliance. The Han Director is the Venerable Han Elder, who oversees the refinement and registration of records. The Great Spirit Who Oversees Birth holds the office of delivering souls and bestowing rebirth. The registers and ledgers record the merits, transgressions, sins, and blessings of scholars and worldly people. The various subordinate spirits, bearing the registers and ledgers, assemble before the Heavenly Honored One to measure merits and bestow blessings, universally delivering humans and devas.\n\nThey examine those who ought to be delivered:\n- Some, whose names are inscribed in the Mysterious Chart from past lives, possess bone configurations suited for immortality;\n- Some, through fasting and upholding precepts, have accumulated merits and evoked resonance;\n- Some, through revering the Three Treasures, have amassed virtuous deeds that reach the heavens;\n- Some, through offering to the Teacher and the Treasure, have been commended by the Three Officials.\n\nThose whose names are recorded in the various heavens undergo strict examination of their ledgers. Based on their merits, their ranks are measured, and according to their superiority or inferiority, they receive promotion and deliverance.\n\nGuanfu says: The above is the main text, narrated by the Jade Dawn Dao Lord. It universally creates the Three Realms, the Boundless Divine Homeland, the Yellow Springs’ Curved Mansion, the Northern Capital of Fengdu, the Three Officials and Nine Bureaus, and the Twelve River Sources.\n\nThe Three Realms are the Realm of Desire, the Realm of Form, and the Formless Realm. The Boundless Divine Homeland refers to the boundless worlds of the ten directions. The Yellow Springs’ Curved Mansion is the long-night mansion of the Nine Dark Regions. The Northern Capital of Fengdu is a great sea in the lower realm’s true north, filled with foul and putrid vapors, its boundaries unfathomable. Within it stands a mountain, its summit piercing the azure heavens and its base descending into the wind springs, formed from the coiled black vapors—this is called the Northern Capital of Fengdu Mountain. There is a great cavern called the Palace of Yin Radiance. Within it lie thirty-six hells, governed by the Heavenly Lord of Grand Yin. Inside are six caverns, each presided over by a Great Demon King of the Six Heavens:\n\n1. The Palace of Zhōu’s Absolute Yin,\n2. The Palace of Tài’s Lethal Judgment,\n3. The Palace of Míng’s Enduring Offenses,\n4. The Palace of Tián’s Illuminating Sin,\n5. The Palace of Zōng’s Seven Transgressions,\n6. The Palace of Gǎn’s Daring Connections.\n\nIf one can uphold the names of these six caverns with constant reverence and awe, the demon kings will protect and recommend them, erasing their sinful names. In life and death, they will receive blessings without end.\n\nThe Three Officials and Nine Bureaus refer to the Offices of Heaven, Earth, and Water, which govern the Three Primes and examine the records. The Upper Prime’s Heavenly Official is subordinate to the Jade Clarity Realm, establishing three palaces, nine bureaus, and thirty-six departments. The Middle Prime’s Earthly Official is subordinate to the Highest Clarity Realm, establishing three palaces, nine bureaus, and forty-two departments. The Lower Prime’s Water Official is subordinate to the Grand Clarity Realm, establishing three palaces, nine bureaus, and forty-two departments. The officials and subordinates of the Middle and Lower Primes are all souls of the deceased who have accumulated merits, received deliverance, and obtained positions. They serve according to their term limits, and upon fulfilling their merits, ascend to the heavenly bureaus. Those whose merits are incomplete return to be reborn among humans.\n\nThe Nine Bureaus are also called the Nine Mounds of the Earthly Sovereign’s Nine Commands. The Twelve River Sources refer to the moon as the essence of the Great Yin and the mother of all waters; the Eastern Well is the source of the Celestial River, where all waters converge. The Great Yin completes one revolution of the heavens each month, thus passing the Eastern Well in all twelve months, where it showers the sweet dew of the Yellow Blossom to cleanse and refine the souls of the dead. These souls also rely on this process to purify their forms before ascending to the Southern Palace for deliverance.\n\nThe human heart is the Southern Prosperity, which is the Vermilion Mound Palace. As the scripture states: *\"The boundless light of the Numinous Treasure illumines the scorching pools of affliction.\"* When the heart is empty, the divine light shines through. Below the kidney region lies the dark and winding Palace of the Hidden Yin Springs, which is the Northern Capital of Fengdu.\n\nBy employing my true light to illuminate the darkness and circulating the true water of the Great Yin from the Eastern Well to cleanse the hidden souls, they are then tempered with the true fire of the Southern Li of the Great Yang. Thus, even the ethereal souls of the Realm of the Utmost Divinity are universally delivered.\n\nThis practice absolves the sins of ancestors and parents across countless kalpas, swiftly erasing their names from the ledgers of transgressions and extinguishing the roots of evil, preventing them from being confined or forced into the ranks of ghosts. The ancestors of humanity—if their descendants fail to cultivate goodness and accumulate virtue—will inevitably suffer calamities, sinking into the depths with no hope of escape. However, those who know to uphold the teachings of the scriptures, turn toward goodness, and spread blessings will absolve the sins of their ancestors and distant kin, enabling all to attain deliverance.\n\nThe *Guān Fù* states: *\"Whenever the Three Officials conduct their records, if descendants perform great deeds, the Jade Emperor issues a decree to immediately deliver the nine generations of ancestors and the seven lineages of forebears.\"* When one person receives deliverance, nine generations of ancestors receive grace. Thus, their names are swiftly erased from the ledgers of transgressions, and the roots of evil are extinguished.\n\nThe *roots of evil* refer to the inherent nature of wicked thoughts, while the *ledgers of transgressions* are the records of sins—both minor and grave—kept by the underworld authorities. Through the mercy of deliverance, their karmic burdens are greatly pardoned, the roots of evil are eradicated, and their names are stricken from the records. Even the underworld authorities cannot detain them or force them into the ranks of ghosts. All kin across countless kalpas ascend through universal deliverance.\n\nThose who know the path of cultivation are not swayed by worldly vanities or clouded by desires; their essence remains serene, their nature perfectly attuned and luminously wondrous. Thus, the Three Corpses and Six Bandits cannot disturb them with defilement. With prolonged cultivation, the myriad qi gather at the Gate of Life, and the hundred spirits guard the Gate of Death, preventing them from sinking into the bitter realms. Countless generations of ancestors and forebears all ascend in turn.\n\nThe Mandate of the Primordial Beginning ensures timely ascension. The Cold Pool of the Northern Capital oversees the protection of form and soul, restrains demons, and recommends deliverance to the Southern Palace. Refined souls of the dead are transformed into immortals, while the living who receive deliverance endure across kalpas. As the kalpas turn, they share the same lifespan as Heaven, forever escaping the Three Paths, the Five Sufferings, and the Eight Difficulties. They transcend the Three Realms and roam freely in the Highest Clarity.\n\n*Mò Ān* says: *\"This speaks of the refinement of the scholar’s ancestors and the deliverance of the scholar themselves.\"* The Mandate of the Primordial Beginning, such as the Heaven-Granting Precious Register of the Numinous Treasure tradition, the Nine Dragon Talismans for Salvation from Suffering, and the various true talismans and writs, are all decrees issued by the Primordial Heavenly Worthy to the Nine Heavens and Nine Offices, commanding their enforcement across the Three Realms and the Ten Directions. Thus, ascension occurs at every moment.\n\nThe Cold Pool of the Northern Capital is the winding Hidden Springs of Fengdu. *Overseeing the protection of form and soul* means that when a person dies, their form perishes and their soul scatters; the Northern Emperor, by decree, oversees and protects the departed souls to prevent their dispersal. By restraining and instructing the Demon Kings to recommend them, they are delivered to the Vermilion Mound of the Southern Palace. The refined souls of the dead, dwelling in the darkest and most yin of palaces, receive the compassionate light of the Heavenly Worthy. When a single spark of true yang is kindled within, the darkness is illuminated, yin is purified, and yang is made whole. Thus, they are transformed into immortals.\n\nThose who cultivate the scriptural teachings and refine their form and spirit receive deliverance in life, preserving their human form across kalpas and ensuring the eternal existence of their true nature. *As the kalpas turn, they share the same lifespan as Heaven* means that while the kalpas inevitably decay and those bound by form and qi are subject to the cycle of rebirth, the enlightened ones—whose wondrous essence is beyond form—remain unbroken across endless kalpas, sharing the same longevity as Heaven and Earth.\n\n*Forever escaping the Three Paths, the Five Sufferings, and the Eight Difficulties*: The Three Paths are the first, the Gate of Sensual Desire, the celestial path of the Upper Corpse; the second, the Gate of Attachment, the human path of the Middle Corpse; and the third, the Gate of Greed, the earthly path of the Lower Corpse. These are also called the Three Evils, which obstruct the path to immortality. The Five Sufferings are: sensuality burdens the heart, attachment burdens the spirit, greed burdens the form, vanity burdens the essence, and the body burdens the soul. Together with the Three Paths, these constitute the Eight Difficulties.\n\nThose who know the Way of returning to the root and restoring life, who gather their emotions and return to their nature, abandoning delusion to return to truth, purify their Three Actions and Six Roots, revealing the singular truth while all illusions dissolve. By circulating the primordial qi of the Primordial Beginning within the union of Kan and Li, they refine the soul and forge the spirit, severing the earthly root to realize the heavenly root. Thus, the souls of the dead receive refinement, the living receive deliverance, and the Three Realms cannot bind them. They instantly transcend the leakless and roam freely in the realm of the Highest Clarity.\n\nThe Heaven of Highest Clarity is ruled by the Jade Perfected Heavenly Emperor, a realm of formless purity and ascetic practice. *Yōu Qī* says: *\"Among the heavens of Highest Clarity, the thirty-six Heavenly Emperors are the most exalted.\"* Their Dao is equal to that of the Primordial Beginning, and their rank is among the Jade Clarity. Thus, they are called the Jade Perfected. This refers to the thirty-six heavens below Highest Clarity, distinct from the thirty-two heavens. They possess radiance but no form, hence they are called *ascetic practice*.\n\n*Ascetic practice* is the Dao within the Dao, the Heaven within Heaven, transcending all barriers, the unobstructed true emptiness. The *Dragon’s Hoof Scripture* also states: *\"The twelve heavens of Highest Clarity are the abodes of the Nine Perfected, where the Jade Perfected Heavenly Emperor reigns as the sovereign of the heavens.\"* His body is crystalline and luminous, his qi governs the utmost truth. Through pure cultivation, he is called the Jade Perfected.\n\nThe preceding text speaks of roaming freely in Highest Clarity, while this section specifically explains that the Heavenly Emperor of Highest Clarity resides above the formless realm, refining his ascetic practice to realize the Dao and attain perfection.\n\n**The Eight Heavens of the East:**\nDefault Annotation states: This sequence of thirty-two heavens follows a common version, but here the *Primordial Numinous Writ, Upper Scroll* is appended, wherein the Dao Lord composed nine characters—this should not be followed. From Yellow Pervasive Heaven to the Seven Luminaries Heaven, the Primordial Beginning accumulated nine yang breaths of pure qi to form six heavens: two heavens of the Desire Realm and four heavens of the Form Realm. The Desire Realm comprises six heavens, which are the lower realm. The people of these heavens possess form and desire, becoming attached through contact with things; when the six roots of desire are purified, they ascend to the Form Realm.\n\n- **Grand August Yellow Pervasive Heaven:** Emperor Yulan Yuming.

The Form Realm comprises eighteen heavens, which are the middle realm. The people of these heavens possess form but no desire, yet they have six colors and eighteen dusts; when the six dusts are all purified, they ascend to the Formless Realm.\n\n- **Primordial Support Celestial Ascent Heaven:** Emperor Kaizhendingguang.

These four heavens are the realm of the Seed People, the upper realm. Here, the utterly perfected are without emotion, and the people are transformed through birth; both form and desire are empty, and cultivation reaches this heaven.\n\n- **Luminous Courtyard Rosy Span Heaven:** Emperor Huijuehun. The correct pronunciation is *Primordial Clarity Brightness*; the Heavenly Lord’s inner sound is Huijuehun.\n- **Abyssal Penetration Primordial Cavern Heaven:** Emperor Fanxing Guansheng.

The correct pronunciation is *Eternal Mystery, Enduring Life*; the Heavenly King’s master text is *Daze Famen*.\n\nThe above correct texts were all spoken by the Most High Lord of the Dao, Yuanshi Tianzun.\n\n**Observing Return** states: These jade taboos and jade sounds of the various heavens are all inscribed in vermilion characters upon azure crystal, concealed within the Highest Clarity Heaven. From **August Sovereign Heaven** to **Forbidden Upper Heaven**, these constitute the Three Realms—namely, the Realm of Desire, the Realm of Form, and the Formless Realm.\n\nThe Realm of Desire comprises six heavens, from **August Sovereign Heaven** to **Seven Luminaries Heaven**. The beings of these heavens possess form and desire, clinging to sensory objects. In the first two heavens, desire is fulfilled through bodily union; in the next two, through hand-touching; in the fifth, through spoken words; and in the sixth, through gazing. As they engage in carnal desire and the union of yin and yang, this is called the Realm of Desire. Due to their indulgence in pleasure, they swiftly decline and decay; when their lifespans end, they sink once more into the various destinies. Those who cultivate and purify the six sense roots may ascend to the Realm of Form, which is the Middle Realm.\n\nThe Realm of Form consists of eighteen heavens, from **Transcendent Balance Heaven** to **Vow-Pledge Heaven**. The beings of these heavens possess six colors and eighteen dusts—six coarse dusts, six fine dusts, and six subtle dusts. When one dust is purified, they ascend one heaven; when all eighteen dusts are purified, they ascend to the Formless Realm, which is the Upper Realm.\n\nThe **Perfect Unity True Regulations** states: In the Formless Realm, the perfected are without emotion, do not engage in yin-yang union, and are born through transformation. They subsist solely on true qi, no longer possessing physical form. Upon attaining the first heaven, they preserve only mind and consciousness to enter qi-contemplation; if mind and consciousness are dissolved, they ascend in succession. If all habitual tendencies are forgotten and they are unattached to existence or nonexistence, they penetrate into spontaneity and ascend to the **Seed-People Heaven**. When the great kalpa turns, water and fire do not reach them, only the vast wind. From **Filial Might Heaven** to **Cloud-Passage Heaven**, the six heavens are destroyed by wind. From **Primal Cavern Heaven** to **Elegant Joy Heaven**, the primal qi disperses and recombines, beyond all kalpas.\n\nFrom **Constant Fusion Heaven** to **Pacified Nurturance Heaven** are the Four Seed-People Heavens, where one penetrates the true Dao. Thus, the **Scripture of the Origin** states: \"When habitual tendencies are exhausted, one transcends the rank of the Seed-People Heaven.\" The **Perfect Unity True Regulations** says: Ascending the four heavens, one penetrates the realm of the Dao, rising and falling with the qi, untouched by calamity.\n\n**Xue Youqi** says: The thirty-two heavens of the four directions are the Four Brahma Heavens. The Heavenly Emperors and Perfected Ones possess distinct forms, yet though their true appearances exist, they move in and out of emptiness without obstruction. For the four directions each contain eight heavens, all formed from accumulated Brahma-qi. The inner names and hidden taboos of each Heavenly Emperor are likewise manifestations of Brahma-qi congealing in emptiness. The Heavenly Worthy expounds these to deliver the world—hence the inexhaustible establishment of scriptural teachings, upon which the cycles of birth and death depend.\n\nThe thirty-two heavens, thirty-two emperors, hidden taboos of the heavens, hidden names, hidden rhymes—all are the naturally resonant numinous chapters of the heavens’ emptiness, the sounds within the heavens, the venerables within the heavens, the spirits within the heavens, the great demons within the heavens, the numina within the heavens. Nine harmonizes with ten, transforming to ascend to Highest Clarity, an unfathomable profundity beyond full comprehension. The divine perfected are dispersed to universally deliver heavenly and mortal beings.\n\n**Mo’an** says: These names and taboos of the Heavenly Emperors are the wondrous manifestations of the heavens’ empty void, naturally formed from qi. Within the thirty-two heavens are thirty-two emperors, and the hidden taboos, hidden names, and hidden rhymes of the heavens are all formed from Brahma-qi congealing in emptiness—this is the \"intermingled void-qi\" spoken of in the *Chapter on Generating the Spirit*, hence called the *Naturally Numinous Chapters*. The sounds within the heavens are the lingering echoes of the hidden rhymes. The venerables within the heavens are the thirty-two emperors. The spirits and numina within the heavens are all the wondrous functions of Brahma-qi, ineffably divine. The great demons are the Five Heavenly Demon Kings.\n\n\"Nine harmonizes with ten\": Nine is the completion of yang numbers; ten is the culmination of yin numbers. This is the function of yin and yang. By fully realizing the wondrous workings of yin and yang, one achieves boundless transformation and directly attains the realm of Highest Clarity. Highest Clarity is the ethereal, pure qi, belonging to the celestial image; *Qian* is the utmost of the six yang, the harmony of nine; *Kun* is the utmost of the six yin, the union of ten. The marvels of the Great Elixir’s fire talisman are fully contained herein. The unfathomable profundities cannot be exhaustively described—these are the hidden taboos and hidden rhymes that cannot be fully recounted.\n\n\"Dispersing the divine perfected\" refers to the meaning of \"dispersal\" in the five sections below. The \"divine perfected\" are the spirits within the heavens. The wondrous patterns and profound models are expounded and unfolded within the empty void, thus universally delivering heavenly and mortal beings, who receive the blessings of life and death.\n\nSome take this as the preface of the **Jade Dawn Dao Lord**, recounting what Yuanshi Tianzun has spoken—these are all essential passages of the true scriptures, not to be interrupted and then resumed.\n\nToday is a joyous occasion of receiving deliverance, passing through the various heavens, beseeching the extinction of the Three Evils, severing the earthly root, flying through the Five Gates, having one’s name recorded in the Great Mystery, with the Demon Kings overseeing and lifting restrictions at the Heavenly Gates.\n\n\"Today\" refers to the day when Yuanshi Tianzun transmitted the scripture to the Dao Lord. The Dao Lord joyously received deliverance, passing through the various heavens. On the day the Heavenly Worthy expounded the scripture, all the heavens assembled—this was the occasion to proclaim to the heavens, commanding them to compassionately deliver beings, extinguish the Three Evils, sever the earthly root, pass through the Five Gates, and thereafter have their names recorded in the Great Mystery.\n\nThe Three Evils are the Three Wretched Paths.\n\nThe *earthly root* refers to the fundamental nature within the hells. The *Five Gates* are the Five Sufferings. Once humans and heavenly beings receive deliverance through the scriptural teachings, the Three Evils and Five Gates are all eradicated, and the root-nature of the hells is likewise severed. Thus, their names are recorded above in the Jade Capital of the Mysterious Metropolis, and the Demon Kings of the Three Realms all act as guarantors, ascending through the Heavenly Gates without further restraint.\n\nThose who cultivate the scriptural teachings and inwardly illumine the Dao of the Ten Revolutions of the Great Elixir—with the Three Actions and Six Roots wholly purified—find the wheel of suffering and the bonds of sin entirely dissolved into emptiness. Once the Golden Mother germinates and the sacred embryo is perfected, true *qi* flows through all the heavens. The yang spirit departs the body, the Three Realms merge as one, and even the mighty Demon Kings raise their hands in praise and submission, ascending through the Heavenly Gates without hindrance. How then could the earthly root remain unsevered? Yet this cannot be attained without the utmost accumulation of merit and practice. If one’s movements are obstructed by external demons, the earthly root cannot be cut—how much less could one transcend and enter the Heavenly Gates? Let the scholar take heed.\n\nThe Eastern Dipper governs fate, the Western Dipper records names, the Northern Dipper decrees death, the Southern Dipper grants life, and the Central Dipper, the Great Chief, oversees all spirits. The Eastern Dipper has five stars, the Western Dipper four, the Northern Dipper seven, the Southern Dipper six, and the Central Dipper three. Some take the seven lunar lodges of the east, south, west, and north as the Four Directional Dippers, with the Northern Dipper as the Central Dipper. As the *Treatise on the Celestial Offices* states: \"The Dipper is the Emperor’s chariot, revolving at the center, governing the four directions, and observing omens.\" The *True Unity Formula* also says: \"Within the Dipper itself are five dippers: Yang Brightness is the Eastern Dipper, Yin Essence the Western Dipper, Cinnabar Prime the Southern Dipper, the Northern Culmen the Northern Dipper, and the Celestial Pass the Central Dipper.\" The teachings hold that Heaven takes the Dipper as its heart, hence it is said: \"The Heavenly Curses point where it turns, day and night without cease.\" The Central Dipper’s Great Chief is the Chief Star, and thus the Northern Dipper is called the Celestial Pivot, rightfully occupying the center as the sovereign of all spirits. Hence it oversees all spirits.\n\nHumans take the heart as their Dipper; the heart’s seven orifices mirror the Dipper’s number. The heart resides at the center of the body, governing the five organs and serving as the abode of spirit and luminosity. Once the scholar of Heaven and humanity receives deliverance, the Four Dippers inscribe their fate, record their names, decree death, and grant life, while the Central Dipper presides over all, with myriad spirits guarding the body. For those who refine the elixir, the fire tally of the celestial cycle is inwardly activated by the Celestial Stem, circulating through the twenty-eight lunar lodges and seventy-two seasonal nodes. With yang fire and yin tally in harmonious balance, the elixir is perfected and the Dao fulfilled.\n\nThe Azure Emperor guards the hun-soul, the White Emperor attends the po-soul, the Vermilion Emperor nurtures *qi*, the Black Emperor circulates blood, and the Yellow Emperor presides at the center, with all spirits subject to none other. Mo’an says: \"This speaks of the correlative body, corresponding to the *River Chart*. The wondrous interplay of the Three and Five is the body of generation and completion.\" The Five Emperors in Heaven are the Five Phases; on Earth, the Five Peaks; and in humans, the spirits of the five viscera. The Azure Emperor’s surname is Chang, his given name Jingming, and he guards the hun-soul, governing the liver. The White Emperor’s surname is Hun, his given name Zangshou, and he attends the po-soul, governing the lungs. The Vermilion Emperor’s surname is Yan, his given name Dongdan, and he nurtures *qi*, governing the heart. The Black Emperor’s surname is Xuan, his given name Mingmeng, and he circulates blood, governing the kidneys. The Yellow Emperor’s surname is Ma, his given name Zhongshen, and he presides at the Yellow Court, commanding all spirits.\n\nThe *Record of the Five Emperors of the Great Cavern* states: \"The Five Emperors exist coeval with Heaven and Earth. When yin and yang first divided, they transformed and gave birth to the Five Phases.\" In the numinous treasure teachings, they are the Five Emperors of red apricots, needle-grinding, sock-wax, and ink-blackness. The liver guards the hun-soul, restraining the three hun; the lungs attend the po-soul, controlling the seven po. The heart governs the nurturing of *qi*, the kidneys store essence, and when water and fire mutually support each other, the two *qi* unite. Those who receive deliverance undergo refinement and rebirth, as the Five Emperors descend their *qi*, transforming and generating the five viscera to complete the Five Phases. Thereafter, they ascend to the Southern Palace in graded ranks—this is the embryo of the five viscera coalescing into an infant. For those who refine the elixir, mastering the art of gathering and inverting the Five Phases, a single *qi* circulates through the Central Yellow Palace, and all spirits merge within the nine orifices. The Five Emperors descend their spirits to refine the golden liquor and descend their *qi* to coalesce the embryo. Over time, the Five *Qi* return to the origin, lead and mercury are captured and controlled, and they return to true earth—thus the elixir is perfected. The Immortal Master says: \"Essence, spirit, hun, po, and intent transform into purple gold frost.\"\n\nThe Azure Heaven Demon King is Bayuan Choubo; the Vermilion Heaven Demon King, Futian Danshi; the White Heaven Demon King, Fanshan Liumu; the Black Heaven Demon King, Jianchou Langfu; and the Yellow Heaven Demon King, Hengtian Danli. The Five Great Demon Emperors are the lords of all spirits. They fly and drum in procession, commanding ghostly legions, brandishing banners and beating drums as they roam the vast heavens. Proclaiming their own glory, all heavens acknowledge their merit. Ascending to deliver beings, they sternly govern the Northern Feng. The Divine Lords receive their mandate to universally sweep away inauspiciousness. The Eight Mighties spew poison, fierce horses spread in four directions. Heavenly Soldiers lead the vanguard, great marshals wield banners. Fire is hurled for ten thousand leagues, flowing bells resound in eight directions. Should any dare to challenge or obstruct the Perfected Ones, the Golden Axe executes them, the Giant Heavenly Queen metes out punishment. Ghostly wraiths are butchered, wind and fire never cease. Thousands upon thousands are beheaded, myriads upon myriads have their forms obliterated. Demons dare not trespass, ghosts dare not manifest as specters. The Three Officials of the Northern Feng clearly inspect the ghostly camps, permitting no concealment, as the Golden Horse relays the message. Universally proclaimed without end, all spirits heed the command. The Five Emperors of the Three Realms declare it to the Supreme Clarity.\n\nMo’an says: \"This speaks of the flowing function, corresponding to the *Luo Writing*’s nine-and-one numerology.\" The Five Heavenly Demon Kings’ four-character titles denote their positions, the middle two their given names, and the final two their courtesy names. The Azure Heaven Demon King’s surname is Fu, his given name Chicheng.\n\nThe Red Heaven Demon King’s surname is Fo, his given name Yousu. The White Heaven Demon King’s surname is Chi, his given name Zhangshi. The Black Heaven Demon King’s surname is Xu, his given name Zhishi. The Yellow Heaven Demon King’s surname is Tianmen, his given name Bokuang. All preside over greed and desire, depleting and agitating the spirit’s qi, obstructing and corrupting the conditions of the Dao—hence they are called Demon Kings. The Five Great Demon Emperors are the Demon Kings beneath the Five Heavens. Dwelling at the head of the myriad spirits, they are called the Ancestors. They correspond to the five sense organs of the human body.\n\nThe *Hidden Writ of Jade Clarity* states: \"The Five Demon Emperors command their officials and subordinates, born together with Heaven, and constantly harass those who study the Dao, unwilling to see them succeed. They further boast before the Celestial Emperors of the various heavens, equating their sagely achievements. Later, during the Dragon Han era when the charts were revealed, they submitted to the transformation of the Primordial Beginning. Thus the *Hymn of Pacing the Void* says: 'The Demon Kings respectfully receive their duties, and thus are able to attend upon the various heavens.' This speaks of the Demon Kings composing songs to disrupt and confuse scholars. After submitting to the transformation of the Primordial Beginning, they thereafter specialized solely in testing through demonic trials. Flying and drumming, they lead their ghostly troops—this speaks of their flight through the Three Realms, drumming and commanding their ghostly soldiers as attendants. Waving banners and beating drums, they style themselves as resplendent. This speaks of their brandishing of flags and banners, dancing with standards and drums, roaming and observing above the Great Void, proclaiming their resplendent merit equal to that of the various heavens.\"\n\nWhen the heavens deliver humankind, they strictly command the Northern Feng—namely, the Northern Capital of Luo Feng. When the heavens open to deliver humankind, they first sternly admonish the ghostly officials of the Northern Feng, forbidding them to cut short lifespans or sever destinies. Following the transformative edicts of the Heavenly Worthy, they issue commands to the Ghostly Emperors, universally proclaiming to the gates of darkness, announcing restrictions and prohibitions, so that no harm may be wantonly inflicted upon beginning scholars. The Divine Lords receive their mandate and universally sweep away inauspiciousness.\n\nYouxi says: \"The Divine Lords are the Great Simplicity’s Boundless Divine Lords.\" When the Divine Lords receive their edict, the Five Great Demon Emperors sweep away inauspiciousness to protect and guard scholars. The Great Demons, bearing their mandate, employ the eight mighty divine dragons to spew poison and subdue evil, while fierce horses draw their chariots to spread in all four directions. Heavenly soldiers wield their orders at the vanguard, great marshals brandish banners in the rear, and the fire-ringing generals hurl fire for ten thousand miles, flames surging in eight directions. Should any dare to test or resist the perfected of the Supreme, should any dare to oppose the edicts of the Celestial Emperors, the golden axes will execute them at the front, while the colossal axes of the Vast Heaven mete out punishment at the rear. The slaughter of ghostly essences and the destruction of demonic specters who dare to test or resist proceed like wind and fire, never ceasing for even a moment. Wherever the divine might reaches, thousands upon thousands are beheaded, myriads upon myriads have their forms obliterated, leaving no trace behind. Thus, demonic trials dare not trespass, and ghostly spirits are stripped of their spectral manifestations. Scholars who reach this point achieve perfection of merit and completion of the Dao, with inner and outer in perfect unity.\n\nThe Three Officials of the Northern Feng clearly inspect the ghostly camps, permitting no concealment. The Golden Horse relays the message through the Three Officials and Nine Bureaus. The Northern Capital of Luo Feng, which examines the hidden and manifest transgressions, blessings, and misfortunes of the world’s people, clearly inspects the ghostly camps’ records of sins and the black registers of those who are due. If a scholar’s accumulated karmic burden is heavy, and the calamities of their deceased ancestors have not yet been absolved, they shall not be allowed to remain concealed or stagnant, but shall all be purged and removed. The post-horses present their cases, and they ascend to roam in the Supreme Clarity. Universally proclaimed without end, all spirits heed the command, and the message is spread throughout the ten directions and the Three Realms, so that all may know and obey the Heavenly Worthy’s decrees. The Five Emperors of the Three Realms and the Great Demon Kings of the various heavens report and recommend, hastening to memorialize the Supreme Clarity.\n\nMo’an says: \"This speaks of those who receive deliverance—Heaven’s gates may not detain or obstruct them, and demonic ghosts may not test or interfere with them.\" *The Supreme Primordial’s Wondrous Scripture of the Upper Chapters on Delivering Humankind, with Unlimited Meanings*, Scroll the Second, concludes. *The Supreme Primordial’s Wondrous Scripture of the Upper Chapters on Delivering Humankind, with Unlimited Meanings*, Scroll the Third.\n\nThe Orthodox Unity Lineage, Transmitting the Dao and Harmonizing Non-Action, Illuminating Ancestral Models and Exemplary Perfected, the Forty-Third Celestial Master Zhang Yuchu, Annotator of the *Original Cavern’s Jade Chronicle*:\n\nIn the *Jade Chronicle of the Original Cavern*, the Dragon Han and Yan Kang eras stretch across boundless kalpas, within the primordial chaos.\n\nShaowei says: \"This discusses the kalpic cycles of formation and dissolution, hence the principles of the Dragon Han and Yan Kang eras.\" The *Mysterious Record of Mount Gui* states: \"The *Original Cavern* is the qi of the Supreme Sovereign. The Heavenly Worthy condensed the qi of the *Original Cavern* to compose the *Jade Chronicle*, taking the Dragon Han kalpa as the first kalpa, its inception named *Red Clarity*, and its conclusion *Yan Kang*. The kalpic cycles are endless, ending only to begin anew. After a kalpa’s end, the Three Realms dissolve and all things’ essences and spirits abide in the Great Void—hence *Yan Kang*, the designation for the kalpa of dissolution. *Red Clarity* marks the beginning of the cosmic chart.\"\n\nThe *Scripture of the Nine Grades* says: \"Of old, in the primordial darkness, when the myriad heavens were undivided, the Primordial Beginning first took form, and the five kalpas commenced transformation. Thereupon, the Heavenly Worthy commanded the Venerable Lord of the Dawn Dao to initiate the celestial records, governing the five kalpas. Thus, the *Original Cavern* embodies the qi of formation, while the *Jade Chronicle* records the celestial origins. From the singular qi’s division, the Three Causes coalesced into the Nine, coiling like dragons or serpents through the nine paths, boundless and infinite—all comprising the primordial qi of the Nine Yangs. The Supreme One then harmonized the Brahma qi to inaugurate the ancestral qi of the Azure Heaven. Hence, the East received nine qi to divide the celestial realm, its kalpa named *Dragon Han*; the South received three qi to divide the celestial realm, its kalpa named *Red Clarity*; the Center received twelve qi to divide the celestial realm, its kalpa named *Supreme Sovereign*; the West received seven qi to divide the celestial realm, its kalpa named *Yan Kang*; the North received five qi to divide the celestial realm, its kalpa named *Kai Huang*. Once the five kalpas had run their course, the August Heaven took form. The singular qi merged with the Dao, the Eight Radiant Sceneries streamed with light, the Eight Emperors manifested, and the Nine Empyreans branched forth. The qi of the Five Yangs of the *Original Cavern* congealed into the *Jade Chronicle*, whereupon the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign was commanded to record the *Original Cavern*’s inception, the kalpic cycles’ revolving origins, and the merits of the Heavenly Perfected and Heavenly People in their cultivation of immortality, along with the paths of ascent and retreat.\"\n\nNow, the *Original Cavern* is the ancestral qi of the Great Cavern of the Primordial Beginning. From this ancestral qi, the *Jade Chronicle* was formed. The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign wielded the brush to record the kalpic reckonings, beginning with *Dragon Han* and ending with *Yan Kang*. Through kalpas of immeasurable duration, formation and dissolution alternate—once dispersed, they reunite, returning to the primordial chaos. Countless hundreds of millions of kalpas pass, boundless and unfathomable. Above, no further colors remain; below, no further abysses endure. Wind and marsh pervade the void; adamantine qi rides the heavens. Between heaven above and heaven below, no darkness or obscurity, no form or shadow, no limits or bounds—only the vast Brahma, the expansive and lightless.\n\nMo’an says: \"This cites the affairs of the ancestral *Dragon Han* kalpa to introduce the principle of *Red Clarity*, the second kalpa’s cosmic inception.\" In the *Dragon Han* kalpa, once heaven and earth were dissolved, above and below could no longer be perceived through form or image.\n\nYan Dong says: \"At each kalpa’s end, the Three Luminaries darken, heaven and earth merge into chaos—what colors remain above, what abysses below?\"\n\nXue Youqi says: \"Wind and marsh are the qi of the Dao. Adamantine is the qi of essence. When the Dao’s qi is utterly yielding, it pervades the void; when the essence’s qi is utterly firm, it governs the heavens.\" Xiao Guanfu says: \"Wind is qi without form; marsh is form without substance—this is the principle of spontaneous non-being, the so-called qi of the Dao. *Gold* endures unchanged through past and present; *adamantine* remains unyielding and indestructible—this is the purest, most wondrous essence, the so-called qi of essence. *Obscurity* is the yin realm; *utmost extremity* is the boundary. *Primordial darkness* is the state before heaven and earth divided. Once a kalpa ends, though heaven and earth are vast, all forms and qi are subject to transformation. Thus, above and below can no longer be sought through color or abyss. Only the qi of wind and marsh, empty and void, and the indestructible adamantine qi, which the heavens’ qi rides in its revolutions, endure like the heavens’ ceaseless motion. As the firmness of Qian inwardly revolves, the yin shadows gradually dissipate. Thus, between heaven above and heaven below, the primordial qi merges into oneness—no obscurity, no form or shadow, ceaseless in its revolutions, without end or limit. Vast and boundless, as before heaven and earth divided; swelling and surging, all pervaded by the Brahma qi. *Expansive* lies beyond the Eight Extremities, indescribable—hence, it is said to be without light, its luminosity inwardly concealed yet unmanifest.\"\n\nCultivators regard the body as transient as bubbles, destined for arising and ceasing. They gather the primordial True One’s qi from before their parents’ birth, as when heaven and earth first divided from the primordial darkness, and further receive the Qian metal’s utterly firm qi to form the golden embryo. This is the wondrous existence of the singular spirit, enduring through kalpas. Though kalpas shift and the Three Realms dissolve, all things empty, this nature abides in the wondrous void, independent and unchanging, revolving without cease. Thus, its ceaseless self-strengthening knows no bounds. The Brahma qi inwardly congeals to form the foundation of the elixir, vast and boundless, containing light yet unradiant—this is the initial division of yin and yang, where yin exhausts itself and yang becomes pure.\n\n*Red Clarity* unfolds the cosmic chart, and salvation proceeds spontaneously. The Primordial Beginning presides in tranquility, unfolding the Five Chapters. The *Red Script* in jade characters, the Eight Might’s dragon script, safeguard and regulate the kalpic cycles, ensuring heaven’s enduring existence.\n\nMo’an says: \"The outer four chapters correspond to the former four heavens; the central chapter corresponds to the latter four heavens.\" *Red Clarity* is the name of a kalpa. Qingyuan says: \"At the inception of *Red Clarity*, the great kalpic cycle unfolds the cosmic chart, the *Jade Chronicle* establishes its records, and heaven and earth reopen. Thereupon, heaven and earth, sun and moon, stars and constellations, mountains and rivers, and all phenomena divide at once. Day and night, cold and heat, the four seasons proceed in succession, without error or deviation.\"\n\nThus it is said: \"The kalpic measures unfold naturally.\" *Primordial Beginning presides in tranquility*—the ancestral qi resumes its brush, stabilizing heaven and anchoring earth. The Five Chapters: from the Primordial Beginning emerges the Brahman qi, shaping form into cloud-seal celestial script, bearing the five wondrous truths of the primordial spirit and the true Dao—hence the Five Chapters.\n\nThe *Red Script* in jade characters: Mo’an says, \"The outer chapters stabilize the outer realms; the *Red Script*, yang’s vermilion manifestation, images the sun. The central chapter stabilizes the center; the *jade characters*, yin’s pale manifestation, images the moon.\" It is also the *Hundun Red Script*—after the cosmic chart’s unfolding, the Red Script is once more proclaimed, carved into jade as script to stabilize and anchor. The Eight Might’s dragon script: Mo’an says, \"The former four heavens and the latter four heavens, together comprising the eight directions, are all dragon script.\" It is also the register of the eight dragons, capable of subduing demons and spirits, commanding ghosts and gods. By its efficacy, it safeguards and regulates the kalpic cycles’ transformations, enduring coeternal with heaven.\n\nThe human body possesses the singular Dao of nature and life. Yet life has its end, while nature knows no decay or ruin. Thus, those who cultivate concentration and wisdom delve deeply into the doctrines of life and death, the principles of the hidden and manifest, until they can fully realize their nature and fulfill their destiny—thereupon, the root of nature remains undying, its stem ever-abiding, directly attaining the wondrous subtleties of the seven returns and nine restorations. Though passing through kalpas uncounted, the wheel of suffering is extinguished—this is long life and enduring vision, transcending the posterior heaven.\n\nThe Brahman darkness of *Mīra* unfolds myriad patterns. The primordial net flows and evolves, spanning the thirty-two heavens. Revolving through the formless, it cycles through the ten directions. The Dipper whirls past the Winnowing Basket, traversing the five constants. Mo’an says: \"This speaks of the second kalpa, when the Red Script is reestablished—the functioning of heaven and earth. With the Red Script’s reestablishment, heaven and earth resume their positions, all things are reborn, and the Brahman qi of the Primordial Beginning’s ancestral kalpa fills and envelops all heavens above. The host of living beings, the ten thousand categories, are thus transformed by a single qi, unfolding and manifesting—thereafter, the myriad things are complete. The Brahman qi flows and spreads, issuing forth as script—this becomes the canonical models, the teachings and admonitions, the scriptural treasuries and written records, serving as patterns without end. Though vast as a hundred thousand myriad threads, all arise from the Brahman qi’s generation.\"\n\nFrom the unfolding of myriad patterns, the net’s principles are established. The *primordial net*—like a net’s master cord. Once the patterns are spread, the net’s principles flow and evolve without cease, thus pervading the thirty-two heavens, revolving even unto the formless realms, cycling through one circuit to reach all ten directions. Beginning and ending in turn, not a single breath of the primordial unity is interrupted—none is left unpervaded.\n\nThe Dipper whirls past the Winnowing Basket: the Dipper is the central Dipper, that is, the heart. The Winnowing Basket pertains to the *gen-yin* position of the east; at each year’s Beginning of Spring, the Dipper’s handle aligns at dusk with the start of *yin*, rotating leftward with heaven, beginning its traverse at the Winnowing Basket, dwelling at the center while sequentially establishing the twelve earthly branches. The five constants are the five planets—not called the five phases and five planets, but the five constants. The Dipper moves at the center, the five phases each fulfilling their functions—this is the constant Dao of heaven and earth. A year’s twelve earthly branches cycle and recommence; the Dipper traverses the Winnowing Basket’s beginning, the sun, moon, and five planets move in retrograde through three hundred sixty-five degrees. When the Dipper’s handle points to earth, the true qi of the prior heaven also follows the Dipper’s inner movement, arising from the ninefold earth to generate the myriad things.\n\nWithin a single day in the human body, there are the seasonal nodes of a year, cycling through the twenty-eight constellations, the twenty-four qi, the seventy-two pentads, and the sixty-four hexagrams to complete the celestial fire’s measures. Measuring by the human body, heaven’s yang arises at *zi*, reaching *yin* as the three yangs, imaging *Tai*, ascending from the lower field. Gradually traversing the Dipper and Winnowing Basket, it circulates through the six voids—all is one’s true unity qi, cycling through the ten directions, following the constant Dao of the five phases. With the heart’s emptiness revolving unceasingly, none fails to be reached by its turning. This is what is meant by \"movement and stillness without origin, yin and yang without beginning.\"\n\nThirty-five divisions, the upper origin’s total qi. The eight luminous scenes merge in darkness, qi enters the profound profundity. Within the profound, the Grand August, the Highest Perfected. Floating upon the luminous rosy clouds, whistling and chanting the cavernous chapters. Mo’an says: \"The *origin* is above the head. The eight scenes are the eight solar terms. The four seasons and four directions each have eight scenes, combining to form the sixty-four hexagrams.\" *Guan Fu* says: \"The thirty-five divisions are the yin-yang, five phases, and twenty-eight constellations.\" Examining the *Du Fen Chi Bu*, it is also called measuring the movements of the sun, moon, and five planets, dividing the degrees of the twenty-eight constellations—hence the thirty-five divisions. When the sun and moon unite as a jade bi and the five planets align as strung pearls, clustering with the twenty-eight constellations, this is called the total qi’s division into thirty-five; in summation, it is one qi.\n\nThe *upper origin* refers to the ancient calendar’s eleventh-month new moon, the winter solstice at midnight, when the sun, moon, and five planets converge at *zi*—this is the upper origin. The eight scenes are the eight luminous scenes within the three sections of the *Scripture of Generating the Spirit*. The *Grand August within the profound* is the Three Treasure Lords within the three qi of the Primordial Profundity—these are the Highest Perfected of the luminous rosy clouds, above the three qi of the Brahman clarity’s scene. The *cavernous chapters* are the golden truths’ radiant luxuriance, whistling and chanting the songs below. Cultivating within, the sun and moon unite as a jade bi—then water and fire achieve harmony.\n\nWhen the five qi pay homage to the origin, lead and mercury are captured and refined—thus seizing Heaven and Earth’s creative transformation, gathering within the crucible and furnace, traversing the twenty-eight lunar lodges, circulating the fire-timing of the celestial revolution. The medicine is gathered at the onset of the winter solstice, seizing the nodal qi of an entire year, at the very moment when the first yang stirs—this is the summation of qi’s upper origin. Thus it is said: the origin is the supreme of beginnings.\n\nAs one qi ascends to the mud-pill palace, the qi-timings of the eight nodes all merge in profound harmony. Thereby one enters directly into the midst of the mysterious mystery, where the indistinct and obscure contain essence. And when my primordial spirit and ancestral qi converge at the summit of the Great Abyss, this is the Highest Perfected’s rosy radiance above the three qi.\n\nWhen the great rosy clouds stream forth their hues and the empty void forms sound, whistling and chanting arise in joyous resonance—this is the spontaneous response. The golden truths shine resplendent, their echoes flowing through the cloudy encampments. Jade tones gather qi, numinous winds amass mist. The Purple Void flourishes in elegance, aiding and sheltering the ten thousand immortals. A thousand harmonies, ten thousand unions—naturally they form the real.\n\nMo’an says: From this passage onward to \"each has its gate of generation\" constitutes the cavernous chapters of the Highest Perfected. The *golden truths* are the golden essence, the numinous root of Heaven and Earth, the ancestral qi of yin and yang, the primordial true unity’s essence, the utmost yang’s qi. The *jade tones* are the sounds of dragon’s chant and tiger’s roar. The *Purple Void* is the Central Yellow Palace.\n\nOnce the Golden Mother returns to the spirit-chamber and the cinnabar foundation is established, the golden embryo begins to sprout. The true spirit shines brilliantly, gleaming like the radiant clarity of golden essence. When the qi of the dragon and tiger’s two strings emerge—fire generating water—the jade tones flow in resonance, the numinous winds stir within, and qi returns to the spirit-chamber to nurture and form the *yin-e*. Within the Central Yellow earthen cauldron, purple light and crimson hues gather qi and amass mist, then flourish to congeal the real. Vigorous within and without, the ten thousand qi return to the real, like waters flowing to their source, like wheel-spokes converging at the hub—spirit flows freely, qi harmonizes.\n\nA thousand spirits harmonize into one spirit, ten thousand qi merge into one qi—all is the principle of spontaneity. Internally conjoined to form the real, these are the most wondrous and divine mechanisms of the returned elixir, not achieved through artificial effort. As the scripture says: \"When the revolving wind blends, the work is completed in a hundred days.\" The *Canticle* states: \"Tending and nurturing the *yin-e*, congealing the spirit to form the body.\"\n\nWithin the real there is spirit—the Great Lord of Longevity, the Peerless Duke, the Venerable White Prime, the Great Unity Controller of Destiny, Peach-Kang and Union-Longevity—grasping talismans and holding registers, preserving life and engendering roots. That within the real there is spirit refers to the primordial spirit as the essence of nature, for it is indestructible from kalpas past—this is the Great Lord of Longevity. The \"something within the indistinct\" and the \"essence within the obscure\"—its essence is most real, and within it there is certainty.\n\nThe Peerless is the spirit of the liver; the White Prime, the spirit of the lungs; the Great Unity is the lord of the hundred spirits, the Controller of Destiny, the spirit of the heart; Peach-Kang and Union-Longevity are the spirits of the two kidneys. The Ancient Fool says: Speaking generally of the four spirits means that metal and wood do not obstruct each other, and water and fire do not overcome one another. The five spirits do not mention the spirit of the spleen, for without the central intent, the four images cannot harmonize—thus the spirit resides within it.\n\nTherefore, the Great Unity dwells at the center, emblematizing the five phases. In the elixir way, Kan receives the earth of Wu, and Li receives the earth of Ji—this is called Kan’s Wu as the moon’s essence, Li’s Ji as the sun’s light. The union of water and fire, the fusion of lead and mercury, the merging of metal and wood—all are mediated by the central intent. The work of refinement, the most wondrous and divine mechanisms, do not exceed the principles of the five phases’ sequence and inversion.\n\nIf one can harmonize the sequential circumstances of daily life to investigate the marvels of inversion, the four images conjoin, the five phases gather—then the stem of life grows ever more secure, and the root of nature attains longevity. This is the utmost spirit within the utmost real. Guanfu says: The true spirit preserves its nature and life, the numinous qi guards its root of generation.\n\nTalismans and registers—expressed in terms of form—are the primordial talismanic mandates. Sought within the formless, they are one’s own true qi. If one can grasp and uphold them without negligence, one may secure and strengthen the primordial life, so that the dead soul receives deliverance and revives its root.\n\nAscending to the Upper Clarity, entering and exiting the Flowery Chambers, within the eight obscurities and the subtlest realms. Below, it stabilizes the human body—mud-pill palace and crimson palace—governing the five qi within, blending the hundred spirits. Ten revolutions return the numinous, ten thousand qi unite as immortals.\n\nMo’an says: This describes how scholars refine and attain the real. The *Upper Clarity* is the mud-pill palace. The *Flowery Chambers* are the three realms’ flowery chambers. The *eight obscurities* are the eight poles. The *mud-pill* is the brain’s summit. The *crimson palace* is the heart. The *five qi* are the five phases. The *hundred spirits* are the spirits within the body. This is the verification of refining and attaining the real.\n\nWithin the real, the spirit’s numinous wonders are already complete—thus it ascends and descends, circulating without cease. Above, it courses through the Heavenly Gate and the Upper Clarity’s Flowery Chambers, circling within the eight poles—even in the subtlest and most minute, there is nowhere it does not reach. Below, it stabilizes the human body, returning to the body’s center from the mud-pill palace down to the crimson palace, and back to the mysterious pass of the central palace.\n\nThe *center*—the body’s center—is called grasping the center, guarding the center, compassing the center, encircling the center, the one center, the yellow center—all are one principle. If the true breath settles within and the center is empty while the exterior is bright, then qi naturally regulates itself. The *five qi* are essence, spirit, soul, spirit-soul, and intent. When breath is regulated to the point of no-breath, the heart is pure and the spirit congeals—the five qi govern within, the hundred spirits merge within, circulating and returning without cease. After ten revolutions, the spirit within the real is unfathomably numinous; the body’s ten thousand qi all enter the immortal way.\n\nThis marks the response of the ten-month internal elixir, when merit is complete and the Dao perfected. Here lies the subtlety of pursuing the two qi along the Yellow Way, uniting the three natures in the primordial palace, drawing emotions back to nature, and returning to the root to restore life—all accomplished through the ten revolutions of practice.\n\nThe immortal way values life and delivers boundless beings. Above, the eight gates open, and the celestial Dharma-wheel takes flight. Karmic retribution, prohibitions, past-life causes, and conditions—all receive universal deliverance, where dead souls gain living bodies. Once the body attains rebirth, it ascends to be heard by the various heavens. Above the heavens, each has its own gate of life.\n\nMo’an says: This speaks of the karmic retribution of worldly beings, yet all may ultimately receive the grace of deliverance. Such is the immortal way of long life. Thus, the Most High cherishes life without limit, universally delivering the infinite. The eight gates are the portals of the eight-directional Dharma-wheel. The good and evil of worldly karma are all created by the mind, giving rise to the division of heaven and hell. People, drowned in the obscuration of greed and lament, unaware of prohibitions, or bound by past-life and present habits, become entangled and stained—hence the retribution of cyclic rebirth. Now, by the great compassion of the Heavenly Worthy, all receive deliverance: above, the eight directional gates open, the Dharma-wheel turns, and the radiance of wisdom shines swiftly like flying celestials, penetrating the darkest depths. Thus, dead souls are delivered and gain living bodies. Having received rebirth, one must rely on the talismanic decree of the Primordial Beginning to petition the heavens, whereupon the heavens, according to one’s merit and endowment, grant a living body—resulting in ranks of immortals, high and low. Dead souls, following the gate of karmic rebirth, each receive the grace of deliverance.\n\nThe gate of life refers to the \"gate of life and door of death\" spoken of in the *Scripture of Life Spirits*. Above the heavens, each has its own jurisdiction. Within them lies the empty cavern, the verses of chanting songs, the numinous chapters of demon kings, and the words that match the exalted perfected. Mo’an says: This is the preface to the demon kings’ songs, where the Primordial Beginning selects their verses to harmonize with the cavernous chapters of the exalted perfected. The \"empty cavern\" refers to the \"empty cavern within heaven\" mentioned earlier. The \"chanting songs\" are the demon kings’ verses. This preface to the demon kings’ songs of the three realms cites the Primordial Beginning’s words to match the cavernous chapters, hence incorporating them among the exalted perfected—this is called the *Numinous Chapter*.\n\nThe scriptures and methods state: The cavernous chapters are the cinnabar and yellow of Mount Gui, the soaring mysterious purple script—not composed by demon kings. The Most High disseminated these three chapters to the world, enabling people to awaken and transcend the three realms. When the Heavenly Worthy descended to subdue the demons, the demon kings all bowed their heads in submission, and were commanded to govern the three realms, each singing verses that transform and fly through the void, warning celestial and human beings, repelling desire-demons, so that those who hear this flying celestial sound turn from the suffering of sensual desire and return to the gate of purity.\n\nThe preceding text states: \"Above the heavens, each has its own gate of life,\" and continues, \"within them lies the empty cavern and verses of chanting songs\"—thus, within the heavens, there are naturally cavernous chapters. The demon kings’ flying celestial songs, in their meaning of reverence and warning, resonate with the celestial perfected, and are thus worthy to be matched with the exalted perfected.\n\nThe first is the flying celestial sound of the Desire Realm:\n\nMo’an says: The Desire Realm lies at the boundary between celestials and humans; in the human body, it is the realm of heart and kidneys. Transcending the ghost path leads to humanity; entering the immortal way leads to flying through the void. Gu Yu says: The demon king’s name is Yu Mo. The Daoist scriptures state: If one’s oral karma is pure, possessing ten good deeds or more, one is born in the six heavens of the Desire Realm. The *Lingbao Scriptures and Methods* state: From Huangzeng to Moye is the Desire Realm; when the six desires are all purified, one ascends to the Form Realm.\n\nThe human path is faint and distant, the immortal way vast and remote;\nThe ghost path delights in endings, while the human gate is life.\nThe celestial way values life, the ghost way values death.\nThe immortal way is ever auspicious, the ghost way ever inauspicious.\nExalted, pure, and numinous, I chant sorrowfully in the great void.\nI only wish the immortal way to succeed, not the human path to perish.\nThe Northern Capital’s Spring Bend Prefecture holds a myriad ghostly hosts,\nAll seeking to cut short human lifespans and sever the gate of life.\nAh! Sing the cavernous chapters to restrain the Northern Feng,\nBind and dispatch the demonic essences, behead the six ghostly blades.\nThe qi of the various heavens surges boundlessly, my Dao daily flourishes.\n\nMo’an says: This speaks of the Northern Capital’s Spring Bend Prefecture within our bodies—namely, the Northern Feng. The myriad ghostly hosts are the demonic essences and six ghostly blades. If I can restrain, bind, dispatch, and behead them, then the celestial qi daily grows within me, and the immortal way daily manifests within me.\n\n\"Faint and distant\" means subtle and elusive. \"Vast and remote\" means lofty and far-reaching. The \"gate of life\" is the threshold of life and death. \"Numinous spirits\" refers to the ghostly realm. The Spring Bend Prefecture is the northern yin within the body. The \"gate of life\" is the stem of life. The human path is faint and fleeting, subtle and hard to exhaust; the immortal way is lofty, remote, and hard to fathom. Thus, from the moment humans take form, they become attached and bound—eyes to forms, ears to sounds, nose to scents, mouth to tastes—all roots of the three poisons and six desires, leading to the retribution of the three paths and five sufferings. Because people cannot cultivate the immortal way, the ghost path seems joyful, standing at the gate of human life and death, seeking only human annihilation. Thus, the celestial way cherishes life, while ghosts value death.\n\nYet those who pursue the immortal way must cultivate virtue and accumulate goodness, and whatever they summon will be auspicious. Those who sink into the ghost path must harm virtue and goodness, and whatever they seek will be inauspicious. \"Exalted, pure, and numinous\"—the demon king speaks of his dwelling’s vastness, which no numinous spirit can invade. Chanting sorrowfully, flying through the great void, he pities those who drift far from the immortal way.\n\nMay scholars only aspire to the fulfillment of the immortal Dao, not the exhaustion of the human way. The Northern Metropolis’ Springs and Bends Prefecture is none other than the Northern Metropolis of Fengdu. The Dark Pass is governed by Mount Tai, where the office oversees the meting of punishments, the tallying of transgressions, and the recording of faults. The Three Realms’ Four Bureaus—mountains, rivers, moats, and altars—on the Three Origins, Eight Festivals, Five La Days, and Three Assemblies, examine and assess merits and demerits with impartiality, down to the finest detail. Those who uphold goodness and cultivate blessings extend their years and lengthen their lives; those who do evil and incur misfortune have their allotted years erased and their lifespans cut short, their records sent to Fengdu’s Springs and Bends. Within Fengdu’s precincts, a multitude of ghosts conspire to intercept and sever human lifespans, cutting off the root of life, unwilling to see the immortal Dao fulfilled.\n\nThe Northern Metropolis of Fengdu within the human body is the River of Love and Sea of Desire. If one cannot restrain desire and nurture the heart-mind, then deluded thoughts scatter like flying dust, all becoming demonic spirits. Ah, let one chant the empty and cavernous verses to subdue and restrain Fengdu’s ghosts, driving them to be bound, sent away, and beheaded, so that the blades of the six demonic ghosts may instantly vanish and fall silent. With inner cultivation and outer conduct accumulated, and myriad virtues perfected day by day, the celestial way’s true radiance will flourish boundlessly, and our Dao shall thus prosper.\n\n**Second: The Chapter of the Form Realm’s Demon King**\n\nMo’an says: The Form Realm is the heaven of the middle heavens; within humans, it is the realm of the heart-mind and eyes. Free from attachment, one can transform, take flight, and ascend. Shaowei says: The Demon King’s name is Mara. The Daoist scriptures state: With three hundred virtuous deeds in bodily conduct, one is born into the Form Realm. From Yuexing Heaven to Tanshi Heaven, there are eighteen heavens in all, comprising the Form Realm. The people of this heaven possess form but no desire; their allotments are subtle and light, the eighteen dusts, and the dusts’ defilements are all purified, ascending to the Formless Realm.\n\nLofty and vast, luminous qi spreads in all four directions. The Brahma-conduct heavens encircle the ten directions. Boundless great spirits all arise from within my body. I possess cavernous verses—ten thousand recitations, and one becomes immortal. The immortal Dao values deliverance; the ghost path clings fast. Heaven and earth stretch boundless, foul qi swirling thickly. Within the Three Realms, joy endures—pass beyond it, and it abides long. Crossing my realm, the body enters spontaneity. At this time, joy is but a trifling grace of mine. The Dragon Han is vast—how can one distinguish the true? My realm is hard to cross, so I compose these cavernous texts. Transforming and flying through the void, I test your body. Success or failure, slackening or retreat—how many will cross? I laugh at those who do not cross, so I sing these songs.\n\n“Lofty” describes the vastness of the celestial body. “Luminous qi” refers to the bright and pure Brahma-qi, spreading in all four directions, flowing through the heavens of the ten directions, pervading all. The “boundless great spirits” are the Demon King’s words on his limitless transformations, all the spirits within his body. The “cavernous verses” are the aforementioned cinnabar-yellow texts of Mount Gui, the soaring mysterious purple script, fully recorded in the *Lingbao* methods—this is not the Demon King’s song. “Ten thousand recitations” means that only after long and sincere accumulation of power will effort reach fruition and immortality be achieved—not merely through frequent recitation.\n\nWhat the immortal Dao values is long life and deliverance from the world. What the ghost path entangles is this: when people cannot cultivate themselves, their bodies perish and their qi disperses; their hun and shen are examined, and their ancestors and forebears are implicated. Heaven and earth are vast and boundless, yet foul and turbid qi swirls and intertwines within them. Within the Three Realms, only those who transcend can abide long and attain supreme joy. “My realm” is the Demon King’s self-reference. Those who cross this realm merge their bodies with spontaneity, all habitual tendencies forgotten, ascending into the formless. At this stage, the six senses are all purified, the eight consciousnesses all empty, utterly serene and unified in truth—its joy is boundless. Though this arises from the fulfillment of power and virtue, it is also through the Demon King’s sponsorship that one becomes immortal. Thus it is said: “a trifling grace of mine.”\n\nThe Dragon Han is the name of the Primordial Beginning’s first kalpa, vast and boundless. At the dawn of the ancestral kalpa, the great simplicity had not yet dispersed, and the true nature of original being was undifferentiated—how could there be distinctions of purity and impurity, refinement and coarseness? Once human desire arose and emotions and perceptions obscured it, the original nature became divided, and karmic consciousness flowed endlessly, until even my realm became hard to cross. Thus I compose these cavernous texts to instruct and encourage, desiring that people realize the Dao and attain truth, crossing this realm.\n\nThe “cavernous texts” are the song-verses. “Transforming and flying through the void,” the Demon King speaks of his unfathomable spiritual transformations, testing the hearts of Dao cultivators: sometimes with what they desire, sometimes with what they fear, sometimes with what they neither desire nor fear. Over days and months, if the heart becomes like iron and stone, unwavering and without slackening, then the Dao’s work is accomplished. Yet how many, despite success or failure, slackening or retreat, are not deterred by demons and ultimately cross the Three Realms? Some falter midway, incurring the Demon King’s laughter—they do not cross. The songs are composed with good intent to encourage. Those who cultivate must accumulate merit and conduct over time, connecting with the numinous. Then inner demons do not arise, outer demons naturally cease, the Dao’s work is accomplished, and one can be delivered from the world.\n\n**Third: The Song of the Formless Realm’s Demon King**\n\nMo’an says: The Formless Realm in heaven is the celestial summit; within humans, it is the Niwan summit. Shaowei says: The Demon King’s name is Shao. The Daoist scriptures state: With six hundred virtuous deeds in the heart-mind, one is born into the Formless Realm’s four heavens. From Haoting Heaven to Xiule’s four heavens, these comprise the Formless Realm. The *Benji Jing* says: Afflictions are knots; learning and conduct are habits. When knots and habits are exhausted, one transcends the rank of the seed people.\n\nEntering the cavernous Dao’s境, one ascends and descends with the qi, untouched by calamity. Above the Three Realms, the vast and distant Great Luo.\n\nAbove the rootless Formless, cloud-layers rise in towering peaks.\nOnly the Primordial Beginning dwells in the home of vast kalpas.\nIt governs and orders our realm, receiving its mandate from Mysterious Capital.\nWhoever transgresses our realm enters the Jade Void.\nMy station is the supreme king, rectifying and ruling all demons.\nIn the emptiness, ten thousand transformations arise; impure qi blooms in profusion.\nThose who preserve the true are few; those who stray and delude are many.\nThe immortal Dao is hard to secure; the ghostly path easily turns to deviance.\nThe human path lies in the heart-mind—truly, it does not depend on others.\nThe immortal Dao values substance; the human path values splendor.\nIf you do not delight in the immortal Dao, how can you pass beyond the Three Realms?\nShould you wish to revolve through the Five Paths, what then can I do for you?\n\nMo’an says: The vast and distant Great Luo refers to the summit of the thirty-two heavens. Heaven is governed by the Northern Culmen, which orders all heavens. The rootless Formless refers to the summit of the three hundred sixty bones and joints. In humans, the Hundred Meetings governs the entire body. Guanfu says: Above the Three Realms lies the Four Heavens of the Seed People, which is the Great Luo Heaven. Above the Great Luo Heaven stands the Jade Capital Mountain, veiled by layered clouds. Since the beginning of vast kalpas, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy has dwelt within, governing the Three Realms and ruling the Mysterious Capital’s Great Luo Jade Clarity. Our realm is the Formless Realm. The Jade Void is the Void’s Jade Capital. Those who cultivate and refine, attaining deliverance from the Formless Realm and entering the Four Heavens of the Seed People, then enter the realm of the Jade Void. My station is the supreme king—the Demon King declares his merit and rank stand above all other demon kings, thus all demons are rectified and ruled by him. Gazing down upon the emptiness, the dusts of form and the filth of karma arise and vanish in ten thousand transformations; impure and turbid qi intertwine in profusion. Thus, those who can preserve and secure their original true nature are few, while those who become deluded and confused are many. The immortal Dao cannot be firmly established, and one easily falls into the deviance of the ghostly path. The human path: when the heart-mind gathers it, the ten thousand differences return to one root; when it scatters, one root becomes ten thousand differences. Each thing possesses its own Supreme Ultimate—none but this heart-mind. The human heart, the Dao-heart, preserving the heart, nurturing the heart, rectifying the heart, cultivating the heart, observing the heart, settling the heart, illuminating the heart—all Three Teachings share this single heart-method. How could there be another? The immortal Dao values substance: sincerity without falsehood. The human path delights in competitive splendor. If one does not delight in the immortal Dao and aspire to self-cultivation, how can one pass beyond the Three Realms? Thus, one must revolve through the suffering wheel of the Five Paths—what then can I do? This is the Demon King’s earnest admonition. The Five Paths are: gods, humans, birds and beasts, hungry ghosts, and hells.\n\nThis realm above the Three Realms, in the flying emptiness, is where the Demon King’s song resounds, its tones interwoven with cavernous chapters. Reciting it a hundred times delivers one to the Southern Palace. Reciting it a thousand times, the Demon King protects and welcomes. After ten thousand recitations, the Dao is complete—one soars into the great emptiness, passes beyond the Three Realms, and ascends to the rank of Immortal Duke. This is the general praise for the preceding song.\n\nThe Demon King, in the realm above the Three Realms, flies through the great emptiness, composing his song. It can be interwoven with the subtle wonders of cavernous chapters, guiding cultivators to daily progress on the Way. From the Realm of Desire through the Realm of Form to the Formless Realm, reciting and chanting its tones—first a hundred, then a thousand, then ten thousand times—there is no fear of slackening or retreat, only the aspiration that each thought returns to the true. Thus, the difficulty of attaining the embodied Dao can only be overcome by those with resolute will and steadfast conduct. Only after ten thousand recitations, when the Dao is complete, can one soar into the great emptiness, pass beyond the Three Realms, and attain the rank of Immortal Duke. The Immortal Duke is the highest rank of the Supreme Ultimate’s immortal grades. Moreover, ten thousand recitations are not merely oral recitation—they require the power of deep accumulation and thick cultivation through inner work and outer conduct, only then can one ascend into the great emptiness and attain the immortal ranks. Thus, the Heavenly Worthy included it in the orthodox scriptures, praising it: \"This numinous chapter and numinous tone—its power of summoning is truly of the utmost weight.\" Therefore, its words interweave with those of the lofty perfected, its tones with cavernous chapters.\n\nThose who hear the numinous tone, the Demon King respects their form. He commands earth spirits to attend and protect, escorting them in departure and return. They are plucked from the earthly gate, freed from the five sufferings and eight hardships. Seven generations of ancestors ascend and migrate, forever departing the ghostly officials. The soul crosses the Vermilion Mound, undergoes refinement, and is reborn. This is called boundless deliverance, universally liberating without end. There are secret celestial texts, revered by all heavens. Those who leak and slight them fall into hell, bringing calamity upon seven generations of ancestors.\n\nMo’an says: This speaks of the universal deliverance of the demonic chapters and the retribution for scholars who leak and slight. The Primordial Beginning’s scriptural teachings end here. The \"numinous tone\" praises the weight of the Demon King’s song. Those who hear this tone and cultivate without negligence—the Demon King reveres their form and spirit. Thus, Guanfu says: Hearing is not merely ear-hearing; it requires the heart to commune with the scripture and conduct to align with the scripture. Thoughts must never be forgotten, always maintaining reverence and awe. Externally, one dispels all conditions; internally, one cultivates the power of concentration. Over time, with deep merit and complete conduct, the Celestial Thearch commands the spirits of earthly sacrifices to attend and protect one’s dwelling, escorting departures and returns. Even if the Dao is not yet complete and one cannot pass beyond the Three Realms or attain the rank of Immortal Duke, one is still plucked from the earthly gate, freed from the gate of death. No longer subject to the hardships of the five sufferings and eight difficulties, one’s merit extends upward to seven generations of ancestors, all ascending and migrating, forever departing the dark passes and no longer subject to the governance of ghostly officials. The soul directly crosses the Vermilion Mound’s Fire Bureau and is reborn in the realm of bliss. Thus, both life and death receive its boundless merit and endless deliverance. At this stage of inner work, the sacred embryo is complete—one sheds the body, spirit transforms, yin is exhausted, and yang is pure. One directly transcends above the Three Realms, and seven generations of ancestors ascend together.\n\nAlthough the effects of scriptural merit are thus manifest, if this secret is revered by all heavens above, those who commit the transgression of leaking and slighting will not only fall into hell themselves but will also bring calamity upon seven generations of ancestors. One cannot but be warned and cautious.\n\nThe Dao speaks: These two chapters are the hidden tones of the Celestial Theads and the Most Numinous Demon Kings—all utterances of the Great Brahma, not common words of the mundane world. Their speech lacks ornate rhythm, their melodies lack florid grace; thus are they called profound and obscure, difficult to fathom in detail. Treasured by the heavens, they are kept secret in the Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace of the Dark Capital. According to the Mystic Statutes, they are transmitted but once in forty thousand kalpas. Should a perfected one bring gold and treasures with a sincere heart, following the ancient protocols to pledge oaths before the Ten Heavens, only then may they be conferred.\n\nMaster Silent Hermitage says: From this point to the five sections of the \"Utmost Clarity’s Perfect Words,\" these are the Dao Lord’s further exposition on the wondrous functions of the scripture—indeed, the postface to the main text. These two chapters of the *Lingbao* postface refer specifically to the preceding first chapter, \"The Primordial Beginning’s Cavernous Mystery *Lingbao* Original Chapter,\" and the following second chapter, \"The Chapter of Empty Cavern’s Songs and Chants.\" Treasured by the heavens, this is the Dao Lord’s further exposition on the scripture’s profound wonders, reflecting the celestial reverence for them.\n\nMaster Observing Return says: These two chapters are the *Hundun Crimson Writ* and the *Primordial Cavern Jade Chronicle*. One elucidates the Dao of the Prior Heaven, the other the Dao of the Posterior Heaven. The *Hundun Crimson Writ* records the names and taboo titles of the Celestial Thearchs and the five celestial designations, its text centered on transcending the arts of the Mystic Ancestors, receiving deliverance in the body of life, unfolding universal salvation, and the purport of traversing passes to proclaim destiny. The *Primordial Cavern Jade Chronicle* speaks of the success and failure of kalpic cycles, the opening of the primordial chaos, the circulation of the primordial qi, the extraction and refinement of cultivation, the return to the root and restoration of destiny, and the Dao of transcending the ordinary to enter sagehood. Thus are they called hidden tones and utterances of the Great Brahma, beyond the reach of common speech. \"Speech lacks ornate rhythm\" refers to the purity and subtlety of the Heavenly Worthy’s scriptural essence; \"melodies lack florid grace\" refers to the clarity and simplicity of the Demon Kings’ songs. Yet their meaning is profound and recondite, scholars unable to exhaust its intricacies. As for the words of Patriarch Silent Hermitage, from the *Lingbao* Original Chapter to the Chapter of Songs and Chants, these are the two chapters—though their text and meaning are one, the *Crimson Writ* and *Jade Chronicle* are contained therein. All are hidden utterances of the Great Brahma, thus treasured by the heavens in the Dark Capital’s Purple Tenuity Palace, transmitted only after countless kalpas in accordance with the Mystic Statutes and prohibitions. How dare one lightly divulge or recklessly transmit them? Those aspirants who seek to receive the scripture must bring gold with a sincere heart, following the celestial perfected ones’ protocols to pledge oaths before the Heavenly Worthy’s sagely host before transmission may be granted. How could one treat them with carelessness, regarding them as common speech? These are all the Dao Lord’s most earnest and solemn instructions.\n\nThe Dao speaks: The revolutions of heaven and earth, too, have their ends of adversity; the sun, moon, and five planets, too, have their waxings and wanings; even the utmost sagely and divine beings have their flourishings and declines; and the lesser learners, too, have their illnesses and afflictions.\n\nWhenever such calamities arise, those of shared qi must unite in heart to perform purification rites, burn incense in the six periods, and recite the scripture ten times through. Thereupon, virtue and power descend at once, dissolving all inauspiciousness. These boundless texts universally deliver limitless beings.\n\nHeaven and earth are the root of the myriad things, yet ultimately confined by form and qi; their revolutions, too, have their adversities and prosperities. Thus, when encountering the tribulations of the Nine Yangs and Hundred Sixes, the Three Realms perish, only to be reconstituted thereafter. The celestial courses of the sun, moon, and five planets, too, have their eclipses and fluctuations; even the utmost sagely and divine beings have their passages and blockages, flourishings and declines—how much more the lesser learners, could they be free of illness and affliction? Therefore, when suffering the bitterness of illness and adversity, one must willingly accept and not complain, thereby aligning with Heaven.\n\nYet humans, heaven and earth, and the myriad things are all of a single qi—this is called \"one root, ten thousand differences.\" The former scholars spoke of Qian as father and Kun as mother, of the people as our siblings and things as our single body—this is what they meant. Thus, whenever such calamities arise, those of shared qi must unite in heart to perform purification rites, burn incense in the six periods, and recite the scripture ten times through. Whether to dissolve celestial disasters above or deliver the multitudes below, to ward off adversity and sustain the declining, there is no prayer that goes unanswered. Thus, virtue and power descend at once, dissolving all inauspiciousness—all through the efficacy of the tenfold recitation. Truly, these are boundless texts that universally deliver heaven and humanity without end.\n\nThe Dao speaks: The lesser learners, their Dao shallow and immortal rank unfulfilled, when their destined time of extinction arrives, their bodies pass through the Great Yin. At the hour of their passing, fellow learners and perfected ones perform incense offerings and recite the scripture ten times to deliver their corporeal forms. By this method, the hun-souls ascend directly to the Southern Palace, where, according to their accumulated merit, they are reborn after a reckoning of days. Their wheel of rebirth unbroken, they thereby attain divine transcendence.\n\nThis is spoken especially for the lesser learners of shallow Dao, whose immortal rank remains unfulfilled. When their destined time of extinction arrives, their cultivation of the immortal Dao incomplete and their bodies not yet purely yang, they must pass through the trials of the Great Yin. The Great Yin is akin to the Northern Yin Springs’ winding depths. At the hour of their passing—when their allotted time nears its end—fellow learners and perfected ones, those of the same teacher or Dao who have attained realization, must perform incense offerings and recite the scripture ten times through to deliver their corporeal forms. By this method, they borrow the perfected ones’ refined yang to recite the scripture, thereby delivering the extreme yin of the corpse and sending the hun-souls to ascend and be reborn in the Southern Palace. The *shi* (corpse) is the untransformed *po*; the *xing* (form) is the untransformed qi. Only through the merit of the scripture and the power of the Dao, refining the substance and molding the hun, can they ascend directly to the Southern Palace. According to their accumulated merit, they are reborn after a reckoning of days, each receiving rebirth in accordance with their learning’s depth and their virtue’s height. Their wheel of rebirth unable to extinguish their fundamental nature, their single spirit undimmed, over time, through the accumulation of profound practice, they, too, attain the immortal Dao.\n\nThe Dao speaks: When the revolutions of heaven and earth reach their end, one must perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite the scripture. When the stellar lodges deviate from their courses and the sun and moon lose their proper times, one must perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite the scripture. When the four seasons lose their order and yin and yang fall out of harmony, one must perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite the scripture. When the sovereign faces calamity and warfare arises on all sides, one must perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite the scripture. When pestilential toxins spread and the multitudes perish, one must perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite the scripture. When teachers and friends pass away, one must perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite the scripture.\n\nPurification rites and scripture recitation carry immense merit. Above, they dissolve celestial disasters and secure the emperor’s reign; below, they dispel toxins and deliver the multitudes. In life and death, all rely upon them—such blessings are beyond measure. Thus, they are called boundless, universally delivering heaven and humanity.\n\nQingyuan said: In this chapter, the Dao Lord clarifies that this scripture not only delivers oneself but also universally aids heaven and earth, sovereigns and ministers, the people and all things—only then is the Dao complete, manifesting the universal deliverance of beings. When the revolutions of heaven and earth reach their end, according to the Supreme Ultimate’s Yuan-Hui-Yun-Shi reckoning, even heaven and earth have their formations and dissolutions, cycles they cannot escape. As the *Book of Changes* says, \"When heaven and earth perish, there is nothing by which to observe their transformations.\" The human body and the workings of creation share the same path, thus one may align with heaven and earth, assist in transformation and nurturance, regulate the Dao, and harmonize its principles. The former scholars did not speak of the unity of heaven and humanity’s governance as merely the oneness of heart and principle. That which governs is called the Emperor; its wondrous functioning is called ghosts and spirits—are they not one and the same? Thus, when the revolutions face adversity and decline, one must perform purification rites and recite the scripture to dispel them.\n\nWhen the stellar lodges deviate from their courses, their celestial positions errant and their shadow-measures awry; when the sun and moon lose their proper times, their waxings and wanings eclipsed—these, too, are confined by the numbers of delay, concealment, and retrogression. One must perform purification rites and recite the scripture to dispel them. When the four seasons lose their order, cold and heat irregular; when yin and yang fall out of harmony, droughts and floods wreak havoc—these, too, arise from deviations in heaven and earth’s supreme harmony. One must perform purification rites and recite the scripture to dispel them. When the sovereign faces calamity and warfare arises on all sides, all such disasters and conflicts stem from yin and yang’s rebellion and governance’s discord. Cultivating virtuous rule, reducing punishments, comforting the people, managing the military, appointing the worthy, and stabilizing the altars of soil and grain—these are the means to dissolve celestial portents and quell human suffering. This is the foremost duty of sagely rulers and worthy ministers. Yet if such calamities arise, one must also perform purification rites and recite the scripture to dispel and restrain them, thereby petitioning Heaven, which will surely quell disasters and send down auspiciousness.\n\nWhen pestilential toxins spread and the multitudes perish, the *qi* of epidemic pestilence poisons the people, inevitably causing death and injury. One must perform purification rites and recite the scripture to dispel and release them, rectifying the *qi*’s conditions so that the pestilential *qi* subsides.\n\nWhen masters and friends pass beyond, for masters transmit the Dao and impart learning, while friends assist in cultivating benevolence and enhancing virtue—these are among the cardinal principles of human relations. At the time of their passing, one must also perform purification rites and recite the scripture to deliver and ferry them across. Having spoken of masters and friends, one may infer the same for parents and kin.\n\nNow, purification rites and scripture recitation carry profound merit and virtue; herein the Dao Lord extols the merits of this scripture. Internally, they empty the heart to refine *qi*, align with the spirits, and preserve authenticity; externally, their merit can ascend to dissolve celestial disasters, safeguard and stabilize the emperor, descend to dispel toxins and harm, and deliver the multitudes. This may be said to extend its blessings to ruler and minister, people and all beings without exception—its merit is boundless, universally ferrying heaven and humanity alike.\n\nThe Dao states: Whoever possesses this scripture and performs these meritorious deeds for Heaven and Earth, the divine sovereigns, and the multitudes—on days of disaster, if one arouses the mind to perform purification rites, burns incense, and recites the scripture ten times—all the heavens will record their name, myriad spirits will attend and guard them, and those of superior attainment will swiftly become ministers of the Golden Portals of the sagely ruler. The heavens record one’s merits and transgressions with unfailing precision, down to the finest detail. The demon kings of heaven will also protect and recommend them, and those who attain the Dao will thereby fully comprehend the most profound teachings.\n\nMo’an says: Here the Dao Lord once more expounds the efficacy of scholars’ recitation and practice. This passage further summarizes the preceding sections—all are the earnest instructions left by the Dao Lord. Whenever disaster arises, if one burns incense and recites the scripture to perform these meritorious deeds for Heaven and Earth, sun and moon, divine sovereigns, and the multitudes, then the heavens will inscribe their name in the registers of immortals, myriad spirits will attend and guard them on all sides—all achieved through the accumulation of scriptural merit. Those of superior attainment, whose learning has reached its apex, may in an instant ascend to the ranks of immortals, serve the Three Realms as ministers, and spiritually wander the Golden Portals.\n\nThe heavens record one’s merits and transgressions with unfailing precision, down to the finest detail, while the demon kings of heaven also protect and recommend them—this repetition serves as the utmost admonition, urging practitioners to diligence in their efforts. Each heaven has its own bureaus of inspection and record-keeping; merits and transgressions, no matter how minute, are recorded without the slightest omission. Merits lead to ascension in the ranks of immortals, while transgressions are consigned to the ledgers of sin—there is no partiality or error. Those who cultivate in accordance with the scripture’s merit will have the demon kings of heaven protect and recommend them, inscribing their names in the heavens.\n\nThose who attain the Dao do so through the scripture, thereby fully comprehending the most authentic and profound teachings, plumbing the depths of the most mysterious Dao. Inwardly seeking it, this is the way of the spirit dwelling in the Mud Pill Palace, the path of nurturing and refinement.\n\n*The Comprehensive Meaning of the Supreme and Wondrous Scripture of Primordial Beginning’s Limitless Salvation of Humanity, Scroll the Third* (concluded)\n\n*The Comprehensive Meaning of the Supreme and Wondrous Scripture of Primordial Beginning’s Limitless Salvation of Humanity, Scroll the Fourth*\n\n**Annotations by Zhang Yu Chu, the Forty-Third Celestial Master of the Orthodox Unity Lineage, Inheritor of the Dao, Expounder of Non-Action, Illustrious Ancestor, and Perfected Radiant Model, Overseer of Daoist Affairs**\n\n**The Immeasurable Sounds of the Great Brahma Hidden Language in the Heavens**   *Composed by the Dao Lord*\n\nMò’ān observes: This is the preface to the central chapter of the *Numinous Writ*, transmitted from the Jade Dawn Dao Lord’s composition.\n\n“The Heavens” refers to the midst of the Four Outer Heavens. According to the *Inner Pointer Scripture*: The Primordial Celestial Worthy, seated in the Cypress Mound Pavilion of the Crimson Clarity World, was enveloped in swirling mists for seven days and nights, the dark yin unyielding. The Five Elders addressed the Celestial Worthy, saying: “Today, as we attend your seat, we witness what has never been seen before.” When the Celestial Worthy expounded the teachings, rivers and seas fell silent, mountains and peaks concealed their clouds. Yet now, in broad daylight, the sky darkens, and heavenly beings tremble in fear—what is the cause? The Celestial Worthy replied: “Today, the Heavens emit auspicious signs, numinous responses arising naturally. Jade characters blaze with radiance, veiling the light of heaven. Let all present close their eyes.” In an instant, the celestial qi surged forth, the gloom dissolved, and five-colored light illumined the ten directions. Suddenly, a *Numinous Writ* appeared in the void above, each character a *zhang* in size, its resplendent script and eight-cornered rays dazzling the eye, impossible to behold directly. The Celestial Worthy proclaimed to all: “This *Numinous Writ* of the Eight Assemblies bears characters without fixed form, its purport profound and abstruse, difficult to fathom. Let it be annotated.” Thereupon, the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign received the Celestial Worthy’s mandate to explicate its meaning and transmit it to the Dao Lord, that those in the Heavens destined for perfection—those with immortal names—might be instructed.\n\nGuānfù observes: The *Great Brahma* refers to the qi of the Primordial Great Brahma, whose convergence and divergence produce the sounds of Brahma. *Hidden language* denotes the secrets concealed within the Heavens, incomprehensible to mortals. *Immeasurable sounds* signify that beings of all realms and kinds may hear its wondrous meaning without limit. Comprising two hundred and sixty-five characters, they are distributed across the Thirty-Two Heavens, eight characters to each. Inscribed upon the palaces and towers of the Mysterious Capital’s celestial bureaus, they align with each practitioner’s cultivation, allowing their qi to return to its proper abode. Thus, the sounds of the Great Brahma pervade the immeasurable yet remain hidden within the Heavens, untransmittable without the brush of the Perfected Sovereign. Some append the upper and lower chapters of the *Numinous Writ*, along with the Dragon Seal’s orthodox text—materials rejected by Lei Xiao—hence their omission here.\n\n**The Central Chapter of the Primordial Numinous Writ**\nMò’ān observes: The *Numinous Writ* is the *Jade-Character Scripture of the Immeasurable Sounds of the Great Brahma Hidden Language*. The *central chapter* is the chapter of the Center. *Primordial* denotes that it was spoken by the Primordial Celestial Worthy, annotated by the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign, and transmitted to the Dao Lord. The *central chapter of the Numinous Writ* is thus the central chapter of the *Great Brahma Hidden Language*.\n\nGuānfù observes: The Former Perfected declared that this *Numinous Writ* corresponds to the sixty-four hexagrams of the *Great Change*. This scripture predates Heaven and Earth, existing before the hexagrams. The Queen Mother of the West said: “Nine suns guide Qian and Kun; the Mother covers the two hexagrams in the East.” Thus, Qian and Kun originate here, followed by *Tun* and *Meng*, culminating in *Jiji* and *Weiji*, forming the warp and woof of creation. Below, the sixty *jiazi* cycles are arrayed, clarifying the qi’s numerical beginning and end. Next, the twelve hexagrams of the monthly nodes and seasonal markers illustrate the yearly alternation of yin and yang, the progression of cold and heat. Further distinctions of waxing and waning moons elucidate a single month. Twelve double-hours are then marked to regulate the daily advance and retreat of the fire-phase and water-tally. For the yearly seasonal markers are compressed into a month, two and a half days equating to one month, and the twelve hexagrams corresponding to the twelve double-hours, collapsing a month into a single day. Each double-hour equates to two and a half days, hence the upper and lower hexagrams differ in application. The *jiazi* cycles and seasonal markers thus serve distinct purposes. In sum, the upper hexagrams pertain to the *jiazi* scripture, while the lower hexagrams govern seasonal markers and temporal reckoning. By inwardly observing the mind’s movement and stillness, ebb and flow, one naturally grasps the intent and words, and the subtlest principles are fully contained herein. Thus, the meaning of this chapter aligns effortlessly with the wonders of the *Great Change*. The Primordial One expounded this scripture before Fu Xi drew the hexagrams—how could it rely on the *Change* to elucidate the Great Brahma’s text? The principle is one and the same; hence, they coincide like tallying tokens, requiring no forced alignment. By this reasoning, from the Queen Mother of the West onward, masters such as Mò’ān and Shǎowēi have all expounded on the *Change*’s imagery. Yet in Guānfù’s view, their interpretations remain superficial. Here, a comprehensive diagram is appended, harmonizing with Shào’s *Prior Heaven*, Wèi’s *Triplex Unity*, and Péng’s *Heart Mirror*. In its mechanism of advancing yang fire and retreating yin tally, it approaches perfection.\n\n**The Eight Heavens of the East**\n*Dǎnlóu āxī, wúhé guān yīn guàn yīn.*\nEight characters, the inner sounds of the Yellow-Canopy Heaven.\n*Dǎn*: Vast and boundless in appearance.\n*Lóu*: The name of the long tower beneath the Jade Capital Mountain, supporting the Mysterious Capital’s bureaus.\n*Ā*: The Ānà spirit of the Mysterious Capital, overseer of the tower, steward of the Great Brahma’s qi.

This is the Heavenly Emperor Lord’s taboo name, presiding over the deliverance of souls and their rebirth.\n*Pú*: *Bodhi*. Holding the nine-colored staff.\n*Tán*: *Tányí*. Grasping the ten-absolute banner.\n\nTogether, these are the Upper Primordial Perfected, who, by constantly reciting the Cavern Chapters, cause the Dharma Wheel to guide the ledgers, Awakening to deliver souls, *Bodhi* to turn the wheel, and *Tányí* to unfurl the banner. Heaven and Earth thereby avoid collapse, and the myriad beings attain eternal existence.\n\nThe Azure Primordial says: *Fǎlǎn Pútán* are the Perfected of the Four Courts of the Jade Purity.\n\n*Jiànà Āyì*, *Hūhē Liúyín*. The eight characters are the inner sound of the Hoary Youth Heaven.\n\n*Jiànà*: The title of the Heavenly Master of Charts, overseeing the ledgers of human life and death, governing immortals, and presiding over the Golden Flower Palace.\n*Āyì*: The name of a tree in the Seven Treasures Grove, covering the four directions.

In Heaven, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy is called *Hēmó*.\n*Liúyín*: The dissemination of chanted hymns. When the kalpa’s destiny ends, *Hēmó* reveals the teachings to universally deliver heavenly and human beings. As the kalpa nears destruction, the true scriptures are concealed, and the Heavenly Worthy, foreknowing this, preemptively sings the hymns.\n\nThose who constantly recite the Cavern Chapters will have the Master of Charts erase their sin records in the eternal night and inscribe their names in the Southern Palace.\n\n*Huādū Qūlì*, *Xiānpú Yùzhēn*. The eight characters are the inner sound of the Level Nurturance Heaven.\n\n*Huādū*: An alternate name for the Azure Flower Gate of the Great Ultimate Palace in Heaven.\n*Qū*: The heavenly Brahman spirits flying above the Great Ultimate, riding the qi of the luminous wind, singing the melodies of the Cavern Chapters.\n*Lì*: The name of a Jade Maiden of Supreme Harmony.\n*Xiān*: *Xiānyún* (Auspicious Cloud).\n*Pú*: The name of a tower in Heaven.\n*Yù*: The hidden name of the Heavenly Emperor Lord.\n*Zhēn*: Arrival. The *Yù* Emperor constantly rides the wheel of the eight luminaries, roaming beyond the eight poles, and returns with the ten-absolute numinous banner to summon heavenly demons and deliver heavenly beings. Those who constantly recite this Cavern Chapter will have flying heavens chant from afar, the Three Realms’ administrators welcome them, and their seven ancestors emerge from the eternal night to ascend to the Southern Palace.\n\n*Dāluò Dàfàn*, *Sànyān Qìngyún*. The eight characters are the inner sound of the Literary Elevation Heaven.\n\n*Dā*: The name of a jade tower in Heaven.\n*Luò*: The tower’s brilliance, resplendent and radiant.\n*Dà*: At the inception of the kalpa’s transformation by the Heavenly Worthy of Great Pardon, a great amnesty is declared, called *Dàyòu*, emptying the Three Evil Paths and halting the trials of the Nine Dark Realms.\n*Fàn*: The qi of Brahman conduct, inaugurating the Dragon Han kalpa and governing the era of Crimson Brightness.\n*Sànyān*: Perfected Ones dispersing incense smoke at the Jade Pass.\n*Qìngyún*: The five-colored auspicious clouds.\n\nThe auspicious clouds reach the Purple Palace, and flying heavens dance in the wheel of space.\n\nThe Azure Primordial says: When the Primordial Beginning first declared the great amnesty, the *Dāluò* palace courts released imprisoned souls.\n\n*Fēisǎ Yùdū*, *Míngmó Shàngmén*. The eight characters are the inner sound of the Māyā Heaven.\n\n*Fēi*: The title of the Flying Heavenly Spirit King. When Heaven and Earth’s destiny changes and sinks into *Yánkāng*, darkness prevails without end. The Flying Heavenly Spirit illuminates and scatters radiance, and all heavens receive the sprinkled qi. In the Dragon Han kalpa, this occurs in an instant.\n*Yù*: *Yùzhēn*, the sacred title of the one who opens the eternal night.\n*Dū*: The *Fēngdū* of the Nine Dark Realms. If one has meritorious deeds, *Yùzhēn* opens the gates of the eternal night, and *Fēngdū* delivers them from the eight difficulties. The seven ancestors are reborn, and the dark souls regain their light.\n*Míng*: Understanding the meaning of the eight characters.\n*Mó*: The Demon King.\n*Shàng*: The Supreme Emperor.\n*Mén*: Those beneath the Straight Gate who can clearly comprehend the meaning of the eight characters will have the Demon King respectfully submit and the Supreme Emperor nurture them at the Gate of Initial Birth. Beneath the gate, the Lord Han oversees destiny and records in the Southern Palace, bestowing blessings upon the nine clans and granting grace in life and death.\n\n*Wúxíng Shàngshǒu*, *Huízhí Liúxuán*. The eight characters are the inner sound of the Transcendent Balance Heaven.\n\n*Wú*: The Upper Dao. It speaks of the qi of the Primordial Beginning illuminating the unsurpassed Dao.\n*Xíng*: The heavenly net of the primordial kalpa, encompassing the eight poles. Brahman qi pervades and flows ceaselessly.\n*Shàngshǒu*: The Sin-Recording Palace of the Northern Dipper. When the celestial mechanism turns and the kalpa’s calculations converge, the numbers culminate, and the great kalpas intersect.\n*Huí*: Turning.\n*Zhí*: Treading. At the kalpa’s inception, the Primordial Beginning treads the void and turns the wheel, disseminating transformation across the ten directions.\n*Liú*: Flowing with the light of the Three Dawns, illuminating the palace of the eternal night.\n*Xuán*: Emptiness. The Transcendent Balance Heaven’s *Xuándū* has the Empty Peak Mountain, where the myriad sages roam and the living and dead return. If one’s Dao is insufficient and the body is destined for extinction, the soul ascends to the Empty Peak to undergo refinement and ascend to the Southern Palace.\n\n*Ātuó Lóngluó*, *Sìxiàng Xūyuán*. The eight characters are the inner sound of the Veiled Heaven.\n\n*Ā*: In Heaven, there is a nine-fold mountain range, connected in continuous ridges.\n*Tuó*: The tower atop the mountain, reaching the radiance of the Jade Purity and overlooking the realms of the Three Worlds. The Emperor Lord often roams the ridges of *Āqiū*, monitoring the sins of the myriad beings.\n*Lóng*: Dragon Mountain, nine hundred million miles from *Ātuó*.\n*Luó*: The names of the sun and moon.\n\nThe peaks of *Luó* intertwine, where the sun and moon shine brightly above. The Four refers to the palaces of the Four Poles: East Florescence, South Ultimate, West Numinous, and North Perfected. The Perfected of the Four Poles govern the registers of life and death. *Xiàng* is the chariot of the Wheel of Symbols. The Perfected constantly ride these chariots, traversing the Three Realms to audit the records of beings’ lives and deaths, and to initiate and deliver learners.\n\n*Xū* is the curved nurturing. The Heavenly Emperor’s taboo-name is the Southern Palace’s Lord of Life-Measurement, who oversees the refinement and deliverance of decayed souls. *Yuán* is the Emperor. He is the Youth Born at Midday, who pours essence upon the Heavenly People. Those who recite and chant the cavernous chapters will have their jade names inscribed in the Emperor’s register, their lives and deaths delivered at the Southern Palace, and the Four Poles will grant them natural feathered chariots, while their seven ancestors rejoice in ascending to the Hall of Blessings.\n\n**Southern Eight Heavens**\n*South Flaming* – *Yīnyàn* – *Cavern Floating* – *Jade Eyes Shimmering*\nThese eight characters are the inner sound of the Harmonious Yang Heaven.\n\n*South Flaming*: In the south lies the Courtyard of Flowing Fire, its flying flames illuminating the eight directions. *Cavern Floating*: The Palace of Cavernous Yang, where the *qi* of flowing fire blazes and floats upward. *Jade Eyes*: The fat of flowing fire, which refines the body, generates jade radiance, and shines like pupils—hence called Jade Eyes. The Perfected of the South Ultimate preside within this palace. All learners who first attain the Dao proceed to the Courtyard of Flowing Fire, where the Perfected wash and refine them with the fire’s fat, scouring away the dust and filth.\n\n*Shimmering*: Multitudinous. *Dharma-forms fall into emptiness, the Nine Numinous advance forward.*\nThese eight characters are the inner sound of the Reverent Florescence Heaven.\n\n*Dharma-forms*: The title of the Primordial Heavenly Honored One during the Dragon Han kalpa. In the Red Clarity kalpa, he was called the Lord of Primordial Name; at the dawn of the Highest Sovereign’s reign, he was named the Primordial Venerable. His Dharma-body, transformed by the *qi* of Brahma, arises with the kalpas, manifesting as a single spirit without undergoing womb-birth. *Fall into emptiness*: The Primordial One arises from the void. *Nine Numinous*: The Nine Florescence Perfected, who govern the Upper Palace of South Prosperity and oversee the karmic confrontations of souls in the Nine Glooms. *Advance forward*: The Perfected, who manage the records of destiny, assess the merits of souls from past lives.\n\n*Guān Fù* says: When the first *yin* arises, it is like cinnabar yielding mercury; true *yin* descends, resembling the moon’s image. Returning to the Central Palace, *yin* retreats to the Yang Chamber, and mercury hastens to merge with lead.\n\n*Dù* and *Wū* are the Terrace of the Universal, *Green Net of the Great Thousand.*\nThese eight characters are the inner sound of the Ancestral Whirlwind Heaven.\n\n*Dù*: A mountain name in Heaven, atop which lie the dens of myriad dragons and the Yellow Chambers. *Wū*: The inner sound of the Perfected of the True Dawn, who governs the Yellow Chambers, enduring the great kalpas without end and growing ever brighter through the Dragon Han. *Pú*: The hidden title of the Flying Heavenly Perfected, who number beyond count. *Terrace*: The Jade Terrace, situated on the southern side of Marsh Mountain. *Green Net*: Lady Luóyīng of the Moon, who administers the measures of the Great Yin, rides the *qi* of Brahma-conduct, and operates the Pass of Transformation in accord with the Heavenly Origin, without error. When the great kalpas converge, the sun and moon both assemble above the Jade Hall, awaiting the kalpa’s reopening to resume their transformations. *Great Thousand*: The reckoning of worlds. A thousand counted to a thousand is the Lesser Thousand; a thousand Lesser Thousands make a Middle Thousand; a thousand Middle Thousands make a Great Thousand. Those who recite and chant the cavernous chapters will ascend to the Yellow Chambers, wander within the Jade Terrace, and behold the realms of the Great Thousand.\n\n*Vast and Nine Ugly, Sháo’s Songs and Yuán’s Circuit.*\nThese eight characters are the inner sound of the August Reed Heaven.\n\n*Vast*: In the era of Extended Purity, the jade characters of Heavenly script were veiled and indistinct, faint and remote. *Vast*: When the Dragon Han kalpa began, its texts became bright again, vast and boundless. Upon encountering the true Dao, when the destiny of men and women reaches its limit and another kalpa passes, the nine *qi* each generate a beast to harm the wicked. Once the kalpa reopens, these nine beasts are called the Nine Ugly Ghosts. The Northern Emperor and the Upper Perfected govern the registers of life and death, thus establishing the Nine Ugly to assist the Three Officials. Their number culminates in eighty-one myriad, measuring the convergence of Heavenly *qi*. The Nine Ugly are titled the Nine Capital Envoys.\n\n*Sháo*: The inner name of the Divine Sovereign of the August Reed Heaven. The Divine Sovereign of the Divine Empyrean is the spirit of the Demon King, who constantly tests learners of the Dao, discerning correctness from error. He composes songs to disturb the heart. Those whose hearts remain steadfast are then protected and promoted to ascend the August Reed Heaven. *Yuán* is another name for the Southern Dipper. *Zhān* is an alternate title for the Northern Dipper. Those with meritorious deeds are recorded by the Southern Dipper, which then delivers them from the trials of the Three Realms, rescues them from the sufferings of the Nine Glooms, and reports to the Demon King, who dares not harm or obstruct them. Those with evil deeds are recorded by the Three Officials and reported to the Northern Dipper, which then instructs the Demon King to annihilate their souls, consigning them to the depths of the Nine Glooms to toil through endless nights, never to emerge.\n\n*Above the Clouds, Nine Capitals—Flying Life Soars Freely.*\nThese eight characters are the inner sound of the Hall Radiance Heaven.\n\n*Above the Clouds*: The inner taboo-name of the Flying Heavenly Divine King.

The Flying Heavenly Divine People constantly scatter the incense of a hundred harmonies and the flowers of the five clouds to observe the Flying Heavenly Perfected. Upon the terrace stands the Grand Perfected Jade Youth, who thrice daily holds the banner of ten absolutes, circling once to summon the Heavenly Emperors of all heavens to thrice encircle the Mystic Terrace. Learners who constantly recite the cavernous chapters will have their flying lives open the path of deathlessness, where the *qi* of eternal life flows downward to refine the five souls, and the Eight Sceneries are preserved. *Soars Freely*: The Forest of Soaring. Learners who ascend the Mystic Terrace and wander the Forest of Soaring, their bodies adorned with Heavenly script and their mouths chanting the cavernous chapters, will eventually ascend to the Palace of the Empty Capital.\n\nAmidst lush fragrance, the Dharma-wheel of Mara turns.

When the Heavenly Pass turns ten times, the great sages of the ten directions ascend to pay court at the Jade Capital, and the myriad spirits assemble in unison as *Yufu* intones the rites. *Moluo* is the inner taboo-name of the Great Demon of Heaven’s Center. At *Yufu*’s first chant, the demon kings bind their forms. Learners who comprehend the *qi* of the four seasons and the ten revolutions of the Pass will, through the gate of the Eight Dharma-wheels, mount their chariots to ascend to Jade Purity and pay court at the Terrace of the Purple Tenuity.\n\n*Haochi* holds the Mirrorless, gathering grace and moving countenance. The eight characters: *Gongqing*, the celestial sound within Heaven. *Hao* is the inner name of the Celestial Inspector-General. *Chi* is the name of the Dragon Abyss, wherein the host of dragons coils, circulating the blossoms of the Eastern Well to bathe the Heavenly Perfected—this is the essence of the Yellow Blossom of the Moon, pouring its flow into the Eastern Well. *Wujing* is the Flying Heavenly Divine King, who emits light of no-color, oversees the registers of life and death, and initiates learners. *Guān Fù* says: From the hour of *shen* to the hour of *geng* is called \"half a catty of water,\" when yin returns to the yang chamber, and the future casts its lead; its substance dissolves and becomes silver. *Lanzi* is the name of the Three Realms’ Gate. Those who know this name will have the demon kings open the palace of the Long Night, releasing the souls of the Nine Darks to pass through the Three Realms’ Gate. *Yunrong* is the name of the Jade Maiden of Mystic Harmony.

Those who submit to him will see their nine ancestors flourish, and those who cultivate this will see their ashen bones reborn.\n\n*Jiu Kai Zi Bian*, *A Na Pin Shou*. The eight characters are the inner sound of the *Jiang You* Heaven. *Jiu Kai* refers to the great unfolding at the beginning, when heaven and earth were not yet divided, and the revolving Three *Qi* opened into nine parts. Once the nine degrees were clarified, the nine positions were arrayed, and the ten thousand kinds of yin and yang were born, naturally discerning and distinguishing. *A* is the inner name of the *A Qiu* Heavenly King, who constantly rides a dragon chariot to ascend the ridge of Dragon Mountain, roaming and observing within the Nine Mysteries. *Na* is the hidden name of the *Na Xie* *Feitian* divine person, who flies through the Three Realms, reviewing the long night and delivering the souls of the good. Those who know the sound of the eight characters will have the Heavenly King assess and deliver their bodies, entering the foremost ranks of the flying transcendent hosts, transforming their decayed bones into the countenance of youths.\n\n*Wu Liang Fu Gai*, *Fu Luo He Shen*. The eight characters are the inner sound of the *Ruan Le* Heaven. *Wu Liang* is the first divine being among the boundless great deities of heaven, who governs all the flying transcendent deities, for all receive their assessment from him and thereby ascend and advance. *Fu* is the inner name of the *Gengsheng* Perfected, who constantly reviews the records of the dark night and examines the roots of good and evil. *Gai* is the title of the *Xuan Zhong* Hall of Blessings. *Fu* refers to the souls of the dark night, who receive deliverance from the Perfected and are thus called *floating*. *Luo* is the *Great Luo*, who opens the great thousand worlds, summoning the guests of rebirth to ascend to the *Great Luo* Heaven and determine their registers, erasing death. *He* is *He Qing* (Joined Celebration). *Shen* is the *Divine Duke*, the minister of the *Great Luo*. Those who know the sound of the eight characters will join in celebration with the Divine Duke and receive deliverance as guests of rebirth.\n\n*Yu Dan Chang Sang*, *Bai Kong Du Xian*. The eight characters are the inner sound of the *Tan Shi* Heaven. *Yu Dan* is the name of the *Jade Capital* in the *Tan Shi* Heaven. *Chang Sang* is the *Qian Lin* (Soaring Grove) in heaven, also called the *Sang Lin* (Mulberry Grove). The *Qian Lin* shades the *Eastern Florescence* Palace, and upon its leaves are the great cavernous chapters, written in purple jade script, resplendent in the *Upper Clarity*. When the divine wind stirs, the cavernous chapters resound—hence *Bai Kong* (Cypress Void). *Du Xian* refers to the flying transcendent divine persons who review the registers of life and death for those who study immortality, delivering the souls of the Nine Darks and ascending them into the gate of the *Dharma Wheel*.\n\nThe Eight Heavens of the North:\n*Jue Wu Zi Yu*, *Jiu Ri Dao Qian*.\n\nThe eight characters are the inner sound of the *Xiao Du* Heaven. *Jue Wu* refers to the divine beings of the *Dragon Han* era, the flying transcendent gods. From the primordial qi of the *Original Beginning*’s initial unfolding, within the boundless, formless *Ming Xing*, *Jue Wu* emerged borne by the currents, coalescing qi to take form. Once the Nine Heavens of *Xiao* were established, they withstood the unending kalpas. *Yu* is the inner name of the Heavenly King of *Xiao Du*. The *Nine* signifies that the *Yu* King rides a chariot drawn by elephant wheels, traversing the Nine Mysteries’ gates, revolving the Nine Mechanisms’ measures, aligning with the kalpa’s appointed time. The *Sun* refers to the solar youths within heaven who guide and harmonize qi; when the celestial revolution ends, the solar youths halt their radiance, delivering and refining the scholars, anointing them with the essence of the *Water Mother*, guiding them with the qi of *Great Harmony*, purifying the Five Spirits, and ushering them into the *Vermilion Palace*.\n\n*Guan Fu* says: *Qian* is the beginning of the myriad things, the spontaneous void, the pure and true unified qi, called the *Empty Qi Golden Womb*. It is likened to silver ore, concealed within the kidneys, termed the *Original Spirit*. As this qi transforms and returns to the *Central Palace*, it becomes the *Elixir Mother*, propelled by the *Metal Duke*. *Metal* is the qi of the primordial, spontaneous *Way*, the *Golden Womb*. *Fire* is the yang qi of daily arising and flourishing. Returning to the root and restoring the origin is called *silver*. The *Kun Mother* covers the east, her form gathering the *Upper Mystery*.\n\nThe eight characters are the inner sound of the *Yuan Dong* Heaven. The *Kun Mother* is the governor of the *Grand Yin*’s capital, the *Nine Numinous Immortal Mother*. She oversees the *Eastern Sea*’s *Fu Sang* and the *Yang Valley*’s abyss, perpetually managing the earth’s mechanisms, revolving the primordial qi, ascending to respond to the *Celestial Pass*. When the *Celestial Pass* turns, the earth’s mechanisms move, and once the heavens complete a revolution, the waters surge and overflow three thousand three hundred times. Thus, the qi of heaven and earth intermingle, the nine seas become misty and vast, and a single water pervades the heavens. The *East* is where the *Eastern Sea* receives convergence, controlling the river’s source. The *Covering* refers to the water spirit who governs *Kunlun Mountain*, reinforcing the great seas, damming the *Eastern Well*, ensuring the earth’s mechanisms do not sink, and preserving the kalpa’s enduring existence.\n\n*Guan Fu* says: *Kun* is the completion of the myriad things. After conception, the spirit is concealed within the kidneys, called the *Kun Palace*. It is both nature and lead, returning to the *Central Palace* in motion. The transforming mechanism is the daily arising yang qi, serving as the foundation of the elixir. The *Medicinal Ancestor* gathers cinnabar and mercury to form the elixir’s substance. As for creation, it arises from nothing into being; thus, *Kun* is established through *Qian*, and *Qian* is completed through *Kun*. *Qian* and *Kun* mutually engender and perfect one another, with no precedence of before or after. It is like lead arising from silver, and silver being perfected through lead. The *Form Gathering* occurs at the time of fixed union, when the *Kun Mother*’s form emerges above the *Eastern Sea*, summoning the *Bird Mother* and welcoming the immortality-seeking scholars with phoenix chariots to the wilds of *Kunlun*. The *Bird Mother* is the spirit overseeing the water’s conditions. The *Upper* refers to the *Kun Mother* ascending to the *Celestial Lord*, reporting the kalpa’s appointed time, delivering the immortality-seeking scholars, and inscribing their names in the *Mysterious Capital*.\n\n*Guan Fu* says: When the first yang returns, the wondrous transforming qi arises from the *Kun Palace*. The true yang ascends like the sun’s image, reaching the *Central Palace*, where the *Metal Mother* gathers it—this is called *cinnabar*. *Cinnabar* is wood; wood is the dragon. This is the *Azure Dragon* receiving the talisman.\n\n*Tuo Luo Yu Miao*, the ethereal qi merges with the clouds. The eight characters are the inner sound of the *Miao Cheng* Heaven. *Tuo* is the inner name of the *Celestial Emperor*, who resides with the *Miao Cheng* Heaven on the *Cloud Al* Ridge. *Luo* is the name of the moon at its first crescent, embracing the moon to shine upon the *Cloud Ridge*. *Yu* is the name of the divine king of the *Miao Cheng* Heaven. Also, *Yu* means *birth*, summoning the flying transcendent gods of the ten directions. *Miao* is the name of the *Feathered Forest* overseer in heaven, a divine king who perpetually assists in governing the Three Realms, reviewing the registers of human life and death, commanding demon kings to protect and recommend those who attain the Dao. *Shao* means *distant and lofty*. Those who are delivered and protected ascend to the *Feathered Forest* overseer, receive talismans, and ascend to heaven, traversing the cloud palaces in lofty flight. *Qi* is the cloud qi. *He* means *merging with the radiance*. Having entered the *Feathered Forest*, they weave cloud qi into garments, ascend to the *Vermilion Palace*, and then merge with the radiance of all heavens to soar upward.\n\nThe *Flying Transcendents’ Great Ugly One* oversees the heavens above. The eight characters are the inner sound of the *Jin Shang* Heaven. The *Flying Transcendents* are the divine kings of the flying transcendents in the ten directions. The flying and mysterious qi within heaven coalesce into the *Empty Cavern Scriptures*, which the flying transcendent divine kings perpetually recite to receive the scholars. The *Great Ugly One* is the registrar of the Three Realms, overseeing the charts of life and death. *Ugly* means *elder*. The great demons of the Three Realms serve the *Great Ugly One*. If scholars know this sound, demon kings will protect their authenticity, and their bodies will ascend to the *Three Clarities*. The *General* is the official who oversees the flying transcendents, governing the qi of the eight assemblies to hasten the heavens’ and earth’s revolutions, and presiding over the officials of the long night to deliver the souls of the *Nine Darks*. Those who know the sounds within heaven will have demon kings submit their names, and the *Great Ugly One* will inscribe them in the *Immortal Capital*, ascending to the *Jin Shang* Heaven.\n\n*Sha Tuo Jie Liang*, the *Dragon Han*’s radiant freshness. The eight characters are the inner sound of the *Chang Rong* Heaven. *Sha* is the *Sha Lan Palace* within heaven, a detached palace of the *Purple Tenuity*. *Tuo* is *Tuo Qiu Mountain*. The multitudes of *Tuo Qiu*, numbering in the hundreds of millions, are all newly delivered and refined individuals whose merits are not yet complete, lingering and dispersing therein. *Jie Liang* refers to when the kalpa’s revolution converges; the multitudes of *Tuo Qiu* calculate their merits and measure their virtues, ascending to *Zhu Lu* to receive blessings and immortality. *Dragon Han* is the name of the initial kalpa. *Ying* is the name of the flying transcendent divine king of the initial kalpa, who perpetually delivers the souls of the dark realms, ascending them to the *Sha Lan Palace*. *Xian* is the youth of the *Southern Palace*. When scholars attain deliverance, the immortal youths guide and refine them upon the *Vermilion Mound*.\n\n*Bi Luo Fu Li*, the empty songs preserve the treasures.\n\nThe Eight Characters are the inner sounds of *Yu Long Heaven*. *Bi* refers to the ever-arising azure *qi* within *Yu Long Heaven*. *Luo* is the name of a flying transcendent deity who, thrice daily, leads the host of celestial sages to ascend and pay homage at the *Seven Treasures Palace*. *Fu Li* is the inner name of the Heavenly King; when the host of sages ascends to pay homage, the Heavenly King proclaims jubilation. *Kong* is the name of the celestial chamberlain. *Ge* refers to the cavernous hymns; when the chamberlain utters a single cry, numinous winds harmonize, and the sound forms the cavernous hymns—hence called *Kong Ge*. *Bao Zhen* means that if scholars comprehend the sound of these Eight Characters, they ascend to the *Southern Palace* as guests of the flying transcendents, preserving themselves through the unending kalpas and treasuring the natural script—thus called *Bao Zhen*.\n\n*E Yi* is without rank; cavernous subtlety is self-authentic. The Eight Characters are the inner sounds of *Fan Du Heaven*. *E Yi* is the inner name of the Heavenly King. During the *Dragon Han* kalpa, when all karmic conditions are exhausted, one transcends the Three Realms, ascends to the *Palace of Great Emptiness*, receives the register of the Nine Immortals, and attains the title of Great Sage. By the *Red Clarity* kalpa’s inception, the Primordial Beginning bestows the title of *Fan Du Heavenly King*. *Wu* is the *Great Void Perfected*; receiving the Heavenly King’s talisman, they deliver the souls of the long night. *Pin* refers to assessing the sins and blessings of the dark souls. *Dong* is the *Cavernous Clarity of Past Connections*. *Miao* is the *Hall of Wondrous Transformation*; when evil karma is exhausted and past connections are resolved, one ascends into the *Hall of Wondrous Transformation*. *Zi* means \"with.\" *Zhen* is *Heavenly Perfection*; thus, one unites with all heavens in perfection.\n\n*Yuan Fan* is vast and boundless, silently delivering beings in the dark and still. The Eight Characters are the inner sounds of *Jia Yi Heaven*. *Yuan Fan* is the *qi* of the Primordial Beginning’s Great Brahma—lofty and cavernously floating, suspended yet unfallen. *Hui Mo* is vast and limitless, distant yet unobstructed, existent yet as if nonexistent. *You* is the dark and desolate. *Ji* is the empty and silent—profound, indistinct, and imperceptible. Within it lies the Real; within the Real lies the Essence—thus universally delivering celestial and human beings.\n\n*Mo An* says: The meaning of the *Divine Book* is profoundly abstruse and difficult to fathom. Yet each direction comprises sixty-four characters, totaling sixty-four phrases, whose natural numerology precisely aligns with the sixty-four hexagrams of the *Great Change*. *Qian* and *Kun* are the progenitors of the *Change*; thus, only *Qian* and *Kun* are singled out, revealing that the myriad transformations of heaven, earth, the myriad things, and the myriad affairs cannot escape the *Change*. The traces of heaven, earth, ghosts, spirits, and creation likewise do not transcend the *Divine Book*—hence, one may infer by analogy. Moreover, the *River Chart* emerged, and Fuxi drew it to form the *Change*; the cloud-script of the Great Void gave rise to the jade characters, which the Heavenly Perfected inscribed to compose the text. The marvel of the divine way’s teachings inherently shares an unspoken resonance.\n\nThis humble one observes: The Heavenly Perfected said, \"The inner sounds of the heavens and the natural jade characters are all congealed from the *qi* of flying mystery, harmonizing the sounds of the five directions. Their script is profound and abstruse, difficult to fathom.\" Thus, the jade characters of the *Divine Book* emerge from the *qi* of the Great Brahma, congealing in emptiness to form script. The Perfected wielded the brush to unfold them into chapters—this is the root of heaven and earth, the origin of the myriad existences. Its silent concordance with the *Great Change*’s mechanism of yin-yang movement and stillness lies in the principle that the myriad existences are all endowed with the *River Chart*’s numbers of generation and completion. Therefore, one cultivates it internally to refine the self and applies it externally to deliver others—ultimately, the Dao is one with the singular root.\n\nThe Dao states: These are the great Brahma’s esoteric utterances within the heavens, the boundless sounds. The ancient script was all a *zhang* in length. The Heavenly Perfected of old inscribed the script to establish the correct sounds. Those who know these sounds and purify themselves to recite them will have the flying transcendent divine kings of all heavens descend to observe their bodies, record their merits, and report them above to the heavens. The myriad spirits pay homage, the earth spirits stand guard at the gates, and even the mighty demon kings will safeguard and recommend them for ascension to immortal ranks. When their Dao is complete and their merits fulfilled, they may roam the Three Realms, ascend through the *Golden Gate*, and serve the Three Realms, daily attending the Emperor’s side.\n\n*Mo An* says: The ancient script refers to the original form of the jade characters when they first emerged—what is now transmitted as celestial seal-script. This is the concluding discourse of the *Dao Lord* on the marvels of the *Divine Book*. *Great Brahma* refers to the natural wondrous *qi* of the heavens congealing to form script. *Esoteric utterances* are the hidden names and taboos of the Heavenly Emperor. *Boundless sounds* are the cavernous natural sounds that resonate through all heavens, endowing boundless merit. *Ancient script* refers to when the Primordial Beginning first expounded the scriptures and the Perfected first wielded the brush—all were celestial Brahma *qi* congealing to form script. Thus, the characters were all a *zhang* in length, inscribed in jade and gold, with eight corners radiating light—later transmitted as celestial seal-script, hence called *ancient script*. The Perfected of old inscribed the script to establish the correct sounds; what is now transmitted are the later translations compiled into chapters—these are the ancient correct sounds. Those who know the sounds and purify themselves to recite them will evoke the heavens to dispatch divine kings to descend, observe, and record their merits, reporting them above. Then, the myriad spirits will pay reverent homage, the earth spirits will stand guard, and even the mighty demon kings will safeguard and recommend them for ascension to immortal ranks. *Dao complete* means that when their merits are perfected and their conduct fulfilled, they may roam above the Three Realms, ascend through the *Golden Gate*, and serve the Three Realms, daily attending the Emperor’s side.\n\n*Guan Fu* says: Within it, the empty and the solid interpenetrate, and the images and numbers are visible. Applying the nine days to guide *Qian*’s reckoning, no principle is left unaddressed. *Qian* begins in the north, just as yang arises at *zi*. *Jia* corresponds to *Qian*, and *zi* is the *Yellow Bell*—thus, *jia-zi* begins at the winter solstice. The *Returning Elixir* is but the cultivation of the great Brahma’s cyclic refinement. The Four Symbols, Five Phases, Three Origins, Eight Trigrams, sun and moon, dragon and tiger, cinnabar and mercury, lead and silver—all are contained within the esoteric utterances. As for the *yin* tally and *yang* fire, the warming and nurturing, the withdrawal and addition—without relying on the hexagrams’ rise and fall, the cyclic progression of *jia-zi*, how could one take them as a model?\n\nThus, the four hexagrams *Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, and *Li* symbolize heaven, earth, sun, and moon, embracing the myriad things as the crucible, vessel, medicine, and pivot of the root and origin. The remaining sixty hexagrams correspond to the sixty *jia-zi* cycles. Following the shifts of spring and autumn, cold and heat divide into twenty-four *qi*, likened to seventy-two seasonal markers, aligning with the twelve months of the year. Distilled into a single month, its seasonal signs are compressed within the twelve hours of day and night—fixing the water clock, rectifying the sundial, clarifying *zi* and *wu*, regulating *yin* and *yang*, harmonizing darkness and dawn, balancing weights and measures—all in accord with heaven and earth’s grand reckoning and the transformative mechanism of *yin* and *yang*. Thus, the hexagrams comprise three hundred eighty-four lines, and fire is measured by three hundred eighty-four *zhu*; through this, the myriad things arise from emptiness, and the principle of the great Brahma is in truth identical to that of the *Great Change*. Herein, the teachings of all masters silently converge, and the elixir and the *Change* have never diverged in their path. If the scholar can fathom the subtle mysteries of the *Numinous Writ*, then the foundation of the elixir and the Dao of the *Change* are attained.\n\nThis sound repels all, dispels all, delivers all, and accomplishes all. It is the sound of heaven’s spontaneity. Reciting it summons flight to behold the realms below, the Celestial Thearch’s distant chant, the myriad spirits’ courtly obeisance, and the Three Realms’ attendance at the imperial chariot. Hosts of demons bow their heads, ghostly essences vanish of themselves. Jade chimes resound, the ten directions grow hushed, rivers and seas fall silent, mountains and peaks swallow their mists. The ten thousand spirits tremble and submit, summoning the immortals of the grasses. Heaven is free of defilement, earth is free of demonic dust. Profound wisdom illumines the void—vast and profoundly profound.\n\n*Mo’an* says: The Dao Lord here expounds the efficacy of the scholar’s recitation. This sound is the sound of boundlessness. Reciting it can expel all demonic influences, dissolve all calamities, deliver all from birth and death, and perfect all celestial and human beings. Its merit extends everywhere without exception, hence the reiteration: the sound of heaven’s spontaneity. These are the words of the perfected of the highest heavens, uttered by the spontaneous *qi* of the Brahma realm—not the fabricated sounds of the human world. Thus, its merit is unparalleled. Reciting it thus enables flight to survey the world below, and its merit is recorded. The Celestial Thearch chants from afar in praise, the myriad spirits offer courtly homage, and the body’s spirits attend the imperial chariot across the Three Realms. At this stage, the Three Worms hide in submission, the Six Thieves retreat in concealment, demonic hordes bow their heads, external demons instantly cease, ghostly essences perish of themselves, and inner delusions instantly vanish. Once karmic consciousness is purified and defilements are emptied, only the original nature and the True Unity remain.\n\nThe jade chimes’ resonance signifies the union of form and spirit in transcendence, where celestial music arises spontaneously. The ten directions’ hush signifies utter stillness without remnant sound. Rivers and seas’ silence signifies the love-river and sea of suffering both stilled. Mountains and peaks swallowing mists signify their inner solidity, where spirit congeals and breath settles. The ten thousand spirits trembling in submission signify the perfection of merit and completion of the Dao, where none fail to submit. The summoning of the host of immortals signifies the myriad spirits’ audience at the origin, gathering unbidden. Heaven free of defilement and earth free of demonic dust signify the quiescence of nature and the obscurity of emotion, merging with the Great Void. Profound wisdom illumining the void: *profound* denotes the secluded and boundless; *wisdom* denotes clarity without limit; *illumining* denotes unimpeded luminosity; *void* denotes limpid purity without end. This is what *Guanfu* calls the power of obscure penetration and luminous insight. At this stage of inner cultivation, the eight directions are thoroughly illuminated, the singular nature merges in fusion, vast enough to embrace the cosmos, subtle enough to enter the tip of a hair—all these are the wondrous subtleties of the supremely profound and minute, whose measure cannot be fathomed by any shore or boundary. This is called the vast and profoundly profound.\n\nThe vastness of heaven and earth, the multitude of the ten thousand beings, the crawling and fluttering creatures—all contain the wondrous essence of the singular spirit, each arising from non-being, all presaged by the Supreme Ultimate, the Five Phases, and *yin-yang* before attaining wholeness. The Supreme Ultimate’s singular root does not conceal itself amid the myriad differences, but returns to the origin of soundlessness and scentlessness, reverting to the Ultimateless. When the Heavenly Worthy expounded the scripture, he began by suspending a single precious pearl to unfold the ten revolutions’ wondrous meaning, wherein the secrets of the great Brahma and the mysteries of the elixir path are fully contained. In its conclusion, he yet feared that disciples might fall into the bias of sinking into emptiness or clinging to existence, and thus declared: *Profound wisdom illumines the void—vast and profoundly profound.* Herein lies the essentials of the entire scripture and the subtleties of the millet-pearl. How could any fabricated dharmas or images attain this? This is what is meant by *accord with emptiness and union with non-being*, reverting to the Ultimateless. It lies in returning to seek within oneself, where the numinous remains undimmed, heaven and earth are complete within me, and the supremely divine and wondrous Dao is attained.\n\n*The Diagram of the Millet-Pearl Suspended in Ten Revolutions*\n*The Diagram of the Golden Elixir’s Ten Transformations and Four Spirits*\n\n**The Middle Scroll: Diagram of the Yi’s Fire Phases**\n**The Supreme Ultimate Diagram: Explanation of the Primordial Qi’s Complete and Wondrous Function in Its Entirety**\n\nThe Chaos of Crimson Script, the Perfect Real of the Non-Non and Primordial Above—this is what is meant by *the Ultimateless and yet the Supreme Ultimate*. In the primordial kalpa of the Origin Ancestor, the myriad heavens were transformed and brought forth; the Three Luminaries were illumined, forming the Root of Heaven. Above, there is no further ancestor—only the Dao is its body. This is what is meant by *the Supreme Ultimate moves and generates yang; when movement reaches its limit, it becomes still. Stillness generates yin; when stillness reaches its limit, it moves again. In one movement and one stillness, each becomes the root of the other. Yin and yang divide, and the Two Modes are established.*\n\nThe Five Scripts unfold and expand—this is what is meant by *yang transforms, yin conjoins, and water, fire, wood, metal, and earth are born. The Five Agents arrange themselves in order, and the four seasons proceed.* The Five Agents are one with yin-yang; yin-yang is one with the Supreme Ultimate; the Supreme Ultimate is fundamentally the Ultimateless. Universally planting the numinous, without script there is no illumination, no clarity, no establishment, no completion, no deliverance, no generation. This is what is meant by *the true of the Ultimateless, the essence of the Two and Five, wondrously conjoined and coagulated. The Qian Dao forms the male; the Kun Dao forms the female. The two qi interact and transform, giving birth to the myriad things. The myriad things ceaselessly generate and transform without end.*\n\n**The Diagram of the Primordial Qi’s Complete and Wondrous Function**—scholars must investigate its meaning, for then the precelestial Dao will unconsciously accord, and the subtleties of creation may be glimpsed. Thus, the Confucian, knowing the causes of the hidden and the manifest, encompasses the myriad things, tracing origins and returning to endings, exhausting principle and fulfilling nature, attains the wondrousness of life and death without delusion. The Old Master says: *Deeply root, firmly stem—long life and enduring vision.* Each has its own tradition.\n\nHow, then, is this achieved? The scripture says: *Know the masculine, guard the feminine—return to the state of an infant. Know the white, guard the black—return to the Ultimateless.* This is the Dao of the Golden Liquid Returned Elixir. Thus can one *probe the root, firm the stem—long life and enduring vision.* Following this doctrine of *observing and returning*, Master Mo’an adopted it.\n\n**Postscript by the Heavenly Lord Xin of the Azure Emperor, Descended in Writing, on Master Mo’an’s Copy of the *Wu Chang Wei Fang* Text**\n\nThe scripture is transmitted by the heart; the scripture is realized by the heart. Heart realizes, heart transmits—heaven and humanity are universally delivered. With this heart, the Emperor will favor you. Sincerely receive and practice it—good deeds are well done.\n\nIn the fifth month of the *gengyin* year, the Heavenly Lord Xin descended in writing, saying: *Disciples are single-minded; believers are sincere. Moved by my teachings of the Chaos Primordial Scripture, I have come to the altar. Great is the Numinous Treasure Scripture of Delivering Humanity—it is not composed by mere literary art. All scriptures must perish when kalpas end, yet this text alone remains in the Jade Capital.*\n\nFrom ancient times to the present, no sage, immortal, or buddha has attained the Dao without revering the scripture of delivering humanity. Among all scriptures, the Primordial Beginning’s *Scripture of Deliverance* is the supreme. The scripture—when yang, it arouses good thoughts in people; when yin, it opens the way to deliver hidden spirits. Its merit is without peer.\n\nI shall speak to you with my ears; you shall listen to my words with your mouth. Ah! Listen with the mouth—here lies the mutual functioning of the six roots, the wondrousness of the Chaos Primordial. Do you, disciples, reciting the *Scripture of Deliverance*, yet know its profound subtleties? The human heart is the precious pearl; the original spirit is the Primordial Beginning. Beyond the spirit, there is no Heavenly Worthy; beyond the heart, there is no Dao or Dharma. Does one who deceives the heart not obscure Heaven?\n\nAt the outset of recitation, gather the myriad thoughts into one—this is the Primordial Beginning summoning the ten directions. Reciting the scripture with right mindfulness is the Primordial Beginning expounding the scripture. When thoughts of emotion and the conscious spirit do not wander recklessly, it is the ten directions listening to the scripture. Forgetting emotion and severing thought—this is the state of silence without lingering echoes. When nature is pure and undivided, the true and false both return. With a single, undivided will, over time one naturally becomes pure. The myriad delusions return to the true—this is the deliverance of heaven and humanity. If you grasp this, you will naturally reach the realm of formlessness. The demons of the myriad thoughts will all be transformed by me—then you are a true person. This is the essence of the scripture.\n\nYet if one recites the scripture without understanding this principle, failing to gather thoughts or return to the true, even reciting ten thousand times a day—what benefit is there to me? As for the section on refinement and deliverance, it is even more difficult to speak of. If one does not know the essence of the scripture, how can one deliver others?\n\nIf you grasp the *Pearl Suspended in Emptiness*, able to gather the myriad thoughts and return to the true, with a single, unmoving will, like the Primordial Beginning, in one hour you will naturally reach the state of silence without lingering echoes—joy and celebration beyond words. At this point, the ghosts and gods of the Three Realms all revere and fear you; all hidden spirits are delivered.\n\nThe refinement and deliverance of hidden spirits is a great merit and virtue. The ancient immortals and buddhas all cultivated themselves as merit and delivered others as virtue—only then could they achieve both merit and conduct in full.\n\nI am an official of thunder. In the remote past, I had already attained the supreme Dao, then later reincarnated into the Thunder Bureau, driving wind and thunder, bringing rain and dew, and generating the myriad things. Thunder is the Heavenly Emperor’s staff of authority, the power of the Emperor, the pivot of the Dao. The power of life and death is governed by thunder; its transformations are endless, its merit without peer. That I can give life and take it is because I practice benevolence and righteousness. Benevolence is the office of spring, generating the myriad things; righteousness is the office of autumn, bringing solemn execution to the myriad things. Assisting Heaven and Earth, enacting the four seasons, acting on behalf of the Supreme Emperor to govern the world’s fortunes—I also ceaselessly cultivate merit and virtue.\n\nIf one attains the Dao but does not aid others, what benefit is there to the Supreme Emperor? Even the Jade Emperor, having attained the Dao after ten thousand kalpas, still presides over the world’s fortunes—how much more so for us!\n\nYou disciples, having entered my Dao and Dharma, must embody this intent. You are all the finest among my disciples, which is why I have spoken thus far—not to leak the secrets of thunder and confuse your assembly. You may single-mindedly cultivate and revere it; I will assist your Dao’s influence from the altar. If you encounter calamities hereafter, you may focus your will, revere one deity, recite one scripture—and thus preserve yourself.\n\nPress on, press on. Should someone nearby inquire about assuming office, the rescript shall read: “Having been protected by the ancestral altar, how dare I speak of office? Office need not be lofty—lofty yet without merit, what benefit is there? Simply call yourself a disciple who upholds the Dao, and this too may reach the Emperor. With a single thought of true sincerity, even metal and stone shall be pierced.”\n\nWritten on the fifth day of the fifth month by the fierce clerk of the Five Thunders, Xin Zhongyi; transcribed by the disciple Chen Yuanheng.\n\nThus concludes *The Supreme, Boundless Scripture of Salvation’s Highest Wondrous Canon: A Comprehensive Exegesis*, Scroll Four.",

Four fascicles.*\n*Source text:* *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, *Dongzhen* Section, *Jade Instructions* Category.\n\n---\n\n### *Fascicle One of The Comprehensive Meaning of the Supreme and Wondrous Scripture of Primordial Beginning’s Limitless Salvation of Humanity*\n*Annotated by the Forty-Third Celestial Master Zhang Yuchu, Orthodox Unity Lineage Successor, Dao-Harmonized Non-Action Expounder, Illustrious Ancestral Model, Perfected of Radiant Virtue, and Overseer of Daoist Affairs*\n\n#### **Diagram of the Supreme Ultimate’s Wondrous Transformation, the Divine and Chaotic Crimson Text**\n#### **Diagram of the River Chart’s Symbolic Numerology**\nHeaven One, Earth Two; Heaven Three, Earth Four; Heaven Five, Earth Six; Heaven Seven, Earth Eight; Heaven Nine, Earth Ten. The heavenly numbers are five, the earthly numbers are five—five positions intermingle, each with its own union.\nThe heavenly numbers total twenty-five; the earthly numbers, thirty. The sum of heaven and earth’s numbers is fifty-five, by which transformations are accomplished and the spirits of ghosts and deities are set in motion.\nWhen the generative and productive root numbers of the Five Directions are subtracted by three, the dragon emerges from fire, the tiger arises from water, the mother conceals the embryo of the child, and the child returns to the mother’s womb. All these are the wonders of the sevenfold return of the Golden Elixir, the ninefold restoration of cinnabar, and the Golden Liquid. Thus, they are no different from the fourteenfold meaning in the scripture.\n\n#### **Diagram of the Thunder’s Single Aperture**\n*Master Baopuzi* states: The Mysterious Female’s single aperture refers to the non-[dual], heart, kidneys, nose, mouth, liver, lungs, grain passage, bladder, and Muddy Pellet.\nTo know this single aperture is to grasp the fire-times of the Winter Solstice, the medicinal substances, the bathing [of the elixir], the shedding of the embryo, and the congealing of the embryo—all lie herein.\nThis aperture is the aperture of thunder, and by attaining it, the mechanism of thunder and dew is captured; there is no need for external seeking.\nThe Perfected who ascend in emptiness employ this. The resonance of Dao and method is but a secondary matter.\n\n#### **Diagram of the Thunder’s Pivotal Mechanism and Mutual Employment**\n**Thunder**\nThunder is the pivot of heaven. Its nature is good, its governance is life, its substance is yang, its image is yin—thus, *jia*, *bing*, *geng*, and *ren* are yang thunder.\n**Lightning**\nLightning is the mechanism of earth. Its nature is evil, its governance is killing, its substance is yin, its image is yang—thus, *yi*, *ji*, *ding*, and *xin* are yin lightning.\n**Mutual Employment of Thunder and Lightning**\nQian and Kun share the same body; sun and moon form a single jade disk. When set in motion, they resound with thunderclaps.\n\n#### **Diagram of the Vast and Profound Mystery**\nHeaven is free of defilement,\nEarth is free of demonic dust.\nDark wisdom pervades clarity—\nVast and profound, the mystery of mysteries.\nThe True of the Limitless penetrates the Book,\nThe Sincere of the Unwavering Center embodies Integrity.\nWithin the True, the Primordial holds the Emperor;\nBeyond Sincerity, there are no further spirits.\nMerging the natures of heaven and earth,\nWhipping and driving the body of wind and thunder.\nThe one whose nature is their body—\nThis is the person of utmost truth and sincerity.\n\n#### **Symbol of Cultivation in the Round Heaven and Square Earth**\nThis diagram aligns with the Precelestial Trigram’s square and round diagrams. Each point within corresponds to a single character from the *Ling Shu*’s configurations. When examined together with the two preceding diagrams, the wonders of heaven and earth become visible—though not exhaustively so.\n\n---\n\n### *The Supreme and Wondrous Scripture of the Limitless Salvation of Humanity from the Numinous Treasure of the Cavernous Mystery*\n*Tai* (Supreme) means great. *Shang* (Upper) means revered. The \"upper\" beyond all upper is the utmost reverence.\n*Dongxuan* (Cavernous Mystery) is a designation of rank. Scriptures comprise the Three Caverns: *Dongzhen* (Cavern of Perfection), presided over by the Primordial Beginning; *Dongxuan* (Cavern of Mystery), presided over by the Numinous Treasure; and *Dongshen* (Cavern of Spirits), presided over by the Dao and its Virtue.\nThis scripture was originally proclaimed by the Primordial Beginning and recorded by the Dao Lord, hence the title *Dongxuan Lingbao* (\"Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure\"). Yet the main scripture simply reads *The Supreme and Wondrous Scripture of Primordial Beginning’s Limitless Salvation of Humanity*, distinguishing it from the prefaces and postscripts.\nThe \"words of the Dao\" are the words of the Supreme Jade Dawn Dao Lord.\nTogether, it is titled *The Supreme Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure*, for the Dao Lord received the Primordial Beginning’s decree to save humanity without limit—this being the title of the single fascicle.\nAmong the thirty-six sections of the Three Caverns, this scripture stands first, hence \"supreme.\"\n*Miao* (Wondrous) denotes the utmost subtlety and profundity, the abstruse and unfathomable.\n*Jing* (Scripture) means \"path\"—the shared Way of daily cultivation and true refinement.\nWhen cultivated internally, it is called the Elixir, the primordial true unity’s ancestral *qi*. Above, there is no further ancestor—only the Dao is supremely revered.\n*Dong* (Cavernous) signifies emptiness, clarity, and luminosity; *xuan* (mystery), profound stillness and subtlety.\n*Ling* (Numinous) is the enduring true nature; *bao* (treasure) is the flowing primordial destiny.\nBy cultivating it within the body, one can save others. The saved are boundless, not subject to limitation.\nTo realize the supreme vehicle of the Dao is not apart from one’s own mind. This mind is the Dao, is the scripture—thus, empty and numinous without obstruction, it saves humanity without limit.\n\n**The Dao Speaks:**\nLong ago, in the Azure Heaven of the Beginning, within the vast expanse of the Blue Empyrean, in the land of Great Floating Black, I received from the Primordial Beginning the *Supreme and Wondrous Scripture of the Limitless Salvation of Humanity*.\n\"The Dao speaks\" refers to the words of the Supreme Jade Dawn Dao Lord. This preface’s title recounts how the Dao Lord received the scripture in the past, recording the circumstances of its compilation.\n*Shiqing* (Beginning Azure) is the Azure Heaven of the Nine *Qi* of the East—one of the Nine Heavens of Divine Empyrean. This heaven is congealed from the *qi* of Brahma, its azure radiance vast and boundless, hence \"Blue Empyrean.\"\nThe *qi* of azure radiance congeals into jade groves and jasper trees, stirred by numinous winds that spontaneously form the *kong song* (\"empty hymn\").\n*Dafulitu* is the name of a country in the Eastern Ultimate. The Dao Lord states: \"In the past, in the land of Floating Black within the Azure Heaven of the Beginning, I received the wondrous scripture from the Primordial Beginning Heavenly Worthy to broadly save heavenly and human beings—this is the *Supreme and Wondrous Scripture of the Limitless Salvation of Humanity*.\"\nThe \"land\" is the Central Palace; the \"mystery\" is the Pass. Its number is five, the ancestor of heaven, earth, and the myriad things. Thus, the hundred creatures are born from earth and return to earth. This is our mysterious pass, the precious pearl.\nThe primordial spirit is the Primordial Beginning. The endless generation and transformation of the ten thousand existences all arise from it.\n*Shiqing* is the image of wood. Fire is the dragon. *Zhen*’s number is three—Qian’s first line seeks and gives birth to the eldest son, just as spring stands first among the four seasons, and the myriad things arise through it.\nYet the first unity gives birth to water, and water gives birth to wood...",

      "translated_text": "Fire arises from two, and fire is born from wood—this is the cyclic principle of the Five Phases, the inexhaustible pattern of ceaseless generation, which may be called manifest indeed.\n\nWhen the Most High Lord of the Dao was to expound this scripture, he circumambulated ten times to summon the ten directions, and only then ascended his seat. *Yuan* is akin to the primordial *qi* of Qian and Kun. Prior to heaven and earth, heaven and earth arose through it—this is the origin of the myriad transformations, the ancestor of the ten thousand forms, the responsive title of the Most Venerable Sovereign of the Void, and thus the supreme honor of all heavens.\n\nAt that time, he expounded the salvific teachings of the *Scripture of Salvation for Humanity*, circumambulating ten times to summon the exalted sages and lofty venerables of the ten directions. They assembled within the Millet Pearl, unfolding the wondrous mysteries, and only then did he ascend his seat to expound the scripture.\n\nThe Primordial Beginning is the ancestral *qi* of the Dharma-body, the primordial spirit. It is the indestructible true emptiness, the original self-nature. When this scripture was expounded, the ancestral *qi* became the essence of the elixir, and as long as the primordial spirit remained undimmed, the mandate of heaven flowed ceaselessly, circulating through the six voids, without beginning in movement or stillness, endlessly coming and going—this is the tenfold circumambulation.\n\nThe ten circumambulations consist of five generative numbers and five consummate numbers, for ten is the consummate number of heaven and earth. The elixir is perfected after ten months of refinement. The ten directions comprise the odd numbers—one, three, five, seven, nine—as yang, and the even numbers—two, four, six, eight, ten—as yin. This is the wondrous function of the returning elixir. Within the mysterious pass, when the true yin and true yang *qi* achieve harmony, the hundred meridians of the body resonate like converging rivers, just as the true sages of the ten directions assemble without summons.\n\nThe celestial perfected deities, exalted sages, wondrously accomplished immortals, and innumerable hosts arrived riding the void, soaring on vermilion clouds through the cinnabar skies, their jade wheels and feathered canopies casting shade, their flowing essence and jade radiance suffusing the five colors in vibrant splendor, illuminating the great emptiness.\n\nThe countless perfected immortals—comprising the five hundred million deities of the heavens, the sun, moon, and stars, the celestial and terrestrial spirits, the watery palaces of heaven and earth, and the immortals and sages of the three realms and ten directions—could not be numbered. All at once, they arrived riding the void, traversing the firmament without movement, borne on tri-colored clouds and crimson mists. Their wheel-chariots and feathered canopies manifested a hundred forms and myriad transformations of the true sages, their numinous changes beyond comprehension. Their flowing essence and jade radiance, suffused with the five colors, intermingled with the luminous brilliance of the Three Lights, their perfected forms resplendent—thus the five hues blazed across the great emptiness, luminous and all-pervading, inwardly cultivated.\n\nOnce the Queen Mother of the West returned to the spirit chamber, she gathered *qi* with her spirit and refined her spirit with *qi*, capturing and restraining lead and mercury, assembling yin and yang. This was the assembly of the thousand perfected and ten thousand sages. In an instant, golden and fiery radiance intermingled within the spirit chamber, illuminating inner and outer, their flowing essence and dazzling colors suffusing the five hues in resplendent brilliance across the great emptiness.\n\nFor seven days and seven nights, the sun, moon, and stars of the heavens, the jade celestial pivots, all halted their revolutions. The divine winds stilled, mountains and seas concealed their clouds. The heavens were free of floating veils, the four *qi* clear and bright. The lands of the realm—mountains, rivers, forests, and trees—were leveled as one, without distinction of high or low. All became azure jade, without variation in hue.\n\nSeven is the number of fire, signifying the sevenfold return. As the *Book of Changes* states: \"After seven days, it returns.\" All numbers, upon reaching seven, revert. The earlier Confucians said: \"Yang is born at *zi*, yin at *wu*. From *wu* to *zi*, after seven, it must return—this is the principle of the waxing and waning of Qian and Kun.\" Speaking of a single day, from noon to midnight, it returns to the *zi* hour. Speaking of a year, from the fifth month when yin is born, to the eleventh month, it returns to the *zi* month. Speaking of a month, from the *wu* day, after nearly seven days, it returns to the *zi* day. This is the fixed pattern of the heavens' movement.\n\nThe \"heavens\" refer to the thirty-two heavens. The \"sun, moon, and stars, jade celestial pivots\" denote the constellations of the celestial sphere and the seven stars of the Northern Dipper. \"Halted their revolutions\" means that the celestial bodies, though ceaselessly revolving, at this moment ceased their motion, returning to their root, the central path alone reverting. Through stillness, they returned, their breath ceasing to enter or exit. Thus, the divine winds stilled, thoughts vanished, and *qi* flowed without distinction of above or below—like mountains and rivers concealing their great clouds and mists, the heavens' floating veils removed, the four *qi* became clear and bright. The lands of the realm—Fuli’s earth—mountains, rivers, forests, and trees were leveled as one, without distinction of high or low. During the scripture’s recitation, with spirit suspended and gaze fixed, pulses stilled and heart ceased, nature reverted and emotions dissolved, all concerns vanished—thus all was leveled as one. The self-nature, like polished jade, was without variation in hue.\n\nThose who cultivate the Dao, forgetting form and severing thoughts, emptying all phenomena, embody a serene nature, the solitary truth revealed—then the scenery of their body, the hundred meridians all stilled, true lead manifests its radiance. This is called \"the earth all becoming azure jade.\" The Mysterious Master said: \"This is the great samadhi, the spirit’s light serene, beholding the Jade Clarity’s realm.\"\n\nThe assembled perfected ones attended the seat as the Most High Lord of the Dao sat in mystery upon the void, floating five *zhang* above the five-colored lions. The Primordial Beginning is the primordial spirit. The \"mysterious seat\" is the spirit chamber. Thus, it floated five *zhang* above the earth, unattached to any form. The five colors are the wondrously transformed *qi*. The lions are the knowing of the heart. The assembled perfected ones attended to the left and right as the Dharma-body of the Primordial Beginning sat in mystery, floating in the void, the five *qi* paying homage to the Crimson Palace. The five colors shone brightly—this is the primordial spirit dwelling in the spirit chamber, darkening the heart to gather *qi*, the three realms merging, the knowing of the heart wondrously bright, illuminating the great emptiness. Thus, the colors of the five directions intermingled in the Central Yellow Palace.",

      "translated_text": "Upon the first recitation of the scripture, all the heavenly sages and great saints simultaneously voiced their approval. At that moment, the deaf among men and women of the entire kingdom regained their hearing. Upon the second recitation, the blind saw clearly. Upon the third recitation, the mute could speak. Upon the fourth recitation, the lame and those afflicted with chronic ailments all rose and walked. Upon the fifth recitation, those suffering from long-standing illnesses and stubborn diseases instantly regained their original form. Upon the sixth recitation, white hair turned black again, and fallen teeth regrew. Upon the seventh recitation, the old reverted to youth, and the young grew stronger. Upon the eighth recitation, pregnant women and creatures bearing young—whether already born or yet unborn—all attained perfect formation. Upon the ninth recitation, the earth’s treasuries opened, and gold and jade revealed their forms. Upon the tenth recitation, withered bones revived, all rising as complete human beings.\n\nAt that time, every man and woman in the kingdom, without exception, turned their hearts in devotion, all receiving protection and deliverance, attaining longevity and eternal life. The nine transformations of the golden elixir achieve their perfection in the ten-month gestation, wherein spirit is wondrously transformed. The generative numbers of the *River Chart* proceed from one to ten, engendering endless life. The permutations of the *Luo Scripture* eliminate the ten in favor of the vertical and horizontal, the one and five and ten—these are the unchanging, fixed numbers of heaven, earth, and the five phases. How could the myriad things and affairs of the world defy them?\n\nThus, the first recitation corresponds to \"Heaven One generates Water.\" Water is conceived within Qian Metal, so the child dwells in the mother’s womb—this is called the *qi* of emptiness within the golden embryo. All things in heaven and earth arise from this, for water is the beginning of all numbers. The simultaneous praise of the heavenly sages and great saints signifies universal joy and approval, enabling the *qi* to circulate fully and the hundred spirits to flourish. The men and women of the kingdom are like the *qi* of yin and yang within a single body. When this *qi* is released, the deaf naturally regain their hearing. Moreover, Kan governs the ears; once the first number is complete, the deaf are naturally unblocked.\n\nThe second recitation corresponds to \"Earth Two generates Fire.\" Fire is conceived within Xun Wood, so the mother conceals the child in her womb—this is called the union of wood and fire in the same position. Moreover, Li governs the eyes; once the second number is complete, the brilliance of Li shines resplendently, and no eye remains unilluminated.\n\nThe third recitation corresponds to \"Heaven Three generates Wood.\" Zhen Wood is conceived within Gen Water. Furthermore, sound pertains to metal, which fundamentally restrains wood yet paradoxically lodges in the womb of metal. This is wood severed in Shen but gestating in You—a symbol of metal hidden within wood. When metal and wood are restrained, they must resonate, so even the mute can speak.\n\nThe fourth recitation corresponds to \"Earth Four generates Metal.\" Dui Metal is conceived within Kun Earth, for earth can generate metal. The feet fundamentally pertain to wood, yet upon the fourth recitation, the lame and chronically ill rise and walk. Metal is severed in Yin but gestates in Mao—this illustrates the symbol of wood within metal.\n\nThe fifth recitation corresponds to \"Heaven Five generates Earth.\" Wu Earth is conceived within Li Fire, attaining the correctness of heaven and earth. Flowing from Wu to Si, the two earths form a *gui*. Thus, Kan’s Wu is the essence of the moon, and Li’s Si is the radiance of the sun—sun and moon unite as one. If one knows how to cultivate and refine, restraining anger and suppressing desires, preserving the heart and nurturing nature, ceaselessly pursuing the work of inner refinement, then the Great One contains the true, the Mysterious Pearl takes form, and one becomes one body with heaven and earth. Attaining longevity and enduring vision would then be effortless. How could long-standing illnesses and stubborn diseases remain a concern? Those afflicted by illness and misfortune do so because they do not comprehend the wonder of returning and restoration.\n\nThe sixth recitation corresponds to \"Earth Six completes it.\" Heaven One generates Water, and Kan resides in the north, yang containing true yin. Thus, Qian Metal generates Kan Water to form true lead. Lead is the mother of metal; lead is black, and metal is white, so white hair turns black again, and fallen teeth regrow—all responses of returning to the root.\n\nThe seventh recitation corresponds to \"Heaven Seven completes it.\" Earth Two generates Fire, and Li resides in the south, yin containing true yang. Thus, Xun Wood generates Li Fire to form true mercury—this is the seventh return. When Li mercury is restrained by metal lead, metal and fire warmly refine. Qian Metal is old yang, and Li Fire is young yin. Thus, the old revert to youth, and the young grow stronger.\n\nThe eighth recitation corresponds to \"Earth Eight completes it.\" Heaven Three generates Wood, and Zhen resides in the east. Gen and Zhen combine to form water, mercury responds to the *qi* of lead and congeals into cinnabar. Cinnabar contains the essence of mercury, symbolizing pregnancy—all is the *qi* of the primordial true one, coalescing within the compass, giving rise to the myriad things. Day and night it circulates, nurturing the sacred embryo, for it is not the *qi* of postnatal yin dregs that can foster it. Thus, pregnant women and creatures bearing young—whether already born or yet unborn—all attain perfect formation.\n\nThe ninth recitation corresponds to \"Heaven Nine completes it.\" Earth Four generates Metal, and Dui resides in the west. Dui Metal unites with Kun Earth, and Kan Water is concealed within the mother’s womb—this is the ninth return. Thus, mercury returns to the earthen crucible and becomes treasure, the *qi* returning to its source. Initially born from the *qi* of emptiness within the golden embryo, the metal’s essence was unseen. Now, at this stage, metal resides in the initial stirring of nature, returning to the Central Palace to become the elixir’s body. The center is earth, and earth is the ground. Thus, the earth’s treasuries open, and gold and jade reveal their forms—gold’s mother resides within the Central Palace.\n\nThe tenth recitation corresponds to \"Earth Ten completes it.\" Heaven Five generates Earth, and earth resides in the center, for earth is the root of the myriad things’ generation and completion. The earth of Heaven Five is yang earth; the earth of Earth Ten is yin earth. When the two earths are layered, they form a *gui*, so the returned elixir is called a *blade gui*. Metal resides within it—this is Qian Metal restraining Li Fire within Kun Earth, the so-called inversion and extension of the five phases. If one cultivates this, one can reverse aging and return to youth, transcend the ordinary and enter sagehood, thus reviving the dead, as the Most High did with Xu Jia.",

      "translated_text": "Thus it is said: withered bones revive, all arise as complete beings. At this time, in that land, whether man or woman, none fails to turn their heart whole. Among all the men and women of that land, upon hearing the scriptural teachings, all receive protection and deliverance, attaining the Dao of longevity.\n\nThe land is like the body; men and women are the yin and yang qi. \"Turning the heart whole\" means yin and yang unite by kind. When the qi of yin and yang harmonize and intermingle, the Great One returns to the true, the living body receives deliverance, and the dead soul undergoes refinement—this is called longevity.\n\nThe Dao states: when the Most High Lord of the Primordial Beginning recites the scripture once, the boundless, immeasurable hosts of perfected great spirits from the Eastern Direction of the Limitless arrive floating through the void. When he recites it twice, those from the Southern Direction arrive floating through the void. When he recites it thrice, those from the Western Direction arrive floating through the void. When he recites it four times, those from the Northern Direction arrive floating through the void. When he recites it five times, those from the Northeast arrive floating through the void. When he recites it six times, those from the Southeast arrive floating through the void. When he recites it seven times, those from the Southwest arrive floating through the void. When he recites it eight times, those from the Northwest arrive floating through the void. When he recites it nine times, those from the Upper Direction arrive floating through the void. When he recites it ten times, those from the Lower Direction arrive floating through the void. This is the sequence in which the Dao Lord transmitted the scripture from beginning to end.\n\nTen recitations deliver beings; ten revolutions return the numinous—this is the fundamental purport of the scripture and its preface. As the Heavenly Worthy recites the scripture, he summons the boundless hosts of perfected spirits from the ten directions of the Limitless, all arriving floating through the void: from the Eastern Direction, the Brahma-Monitor Xu Yan Heaven and others of the Zhen Palace, Mao position, forming the boundless hosts; from the Southern Direction, the Yüdan Immeasurable Heaven and others of the Li Palace, Wu position, forming the boundless hosts; from the Western Direction, the Spirit-Transformed Brahma-Assistant Heaven and others of the Dui Palace, You position, forming the boundless hosts; from the Northern Direction, the Cavernous Primordial Resonant-Heaven and others of the Kan Palace, Zi position, forming the boundless hosts; from the Northeast, the Lofty Void Pure Bright Heaven and others of the Gen Palace, Yin position, forming the boundless hosts; from the Southeast, the Pāramitā Unconceited Joy Heaven and others of the Xun Palace, Si position, forming the boundless hosts; from the Southwest, the Stillness-Enveloped Tuśita Heaven and others of the Kun Palace, Shen position, forming the boundless hosts; from the Northwest, the Supreme Meditation Goodness Immeasurable Longevity Heaven and others of the Qian Palace, Hai position, forming the boundless hosts; from the Upper Direction, the Nine Empyreans, Upper Clarity, Jade Perfected, and the thirty-six heavens, forming the boundless hosts; from the Lower Direction, the Formless Realm, Form Realm, Desire Realm, and the thirty-two heavens, extending to the boundless hosts of the Three Origins and Nine Earths—all assemble within the Azure Beginning Heaven, in the Floating Black Soil, to hear the scripture and listen to the Dharma.\n\nCultivating this internally, true lead becomes the medicine, and the Primordial Mysterious Pass becomes the foundation of the elixir—this is the recitation of the scripture by the Primordial Beginning. Earth dwells in the Central Palace, naturally forming the number ten; the center is the Mysterious Pass. The ten recitations correspond to the generative and completive numbers of heaven and earth. The ten directions arise from the five phases’ combinations: one, three, five, seven, nine are the celestial numbers, totaling twenty-five, the essence of yang. Two, four, six, eight, ten are the terrestrial numbers, the blossoms of yin. The generative number of yang is five, the root of the five phases; the completive number of yin is ten, the root of the myriad transformations. One and nine, four and six, combined make ten—this is metal and water sharing the same origin. Two and eight, three and seven, combined make ten—this is wood and fire sharing the same body. In total, they make fifty-five, distributed among the five directions.\n\nWhen the five phases are inverted, the dragon emerges from fire, and the tiger arises from water. Fire is born of wood, thus cinnabar draws forth mercury—this is the sevenfold return, cinnabar returning to its origin. Water is born of metal, thus silver refines lead within—this is the ninefold restoration, golden liquid returning to the true. The *Book of Changes* states: \"Heaven and earth intermingle, and the myriad things mate in purity\"—thus the boundless, limitless hosts of perfected great spirits all arrive.\n\nTherefore, the foundation of the elixir mirrors the three hundred eighty-four lines, circulating the fire times. Internally, the five stars revolve, the twenty-eight constellations array in orbit, the crucible hastens the three thousand six hundred upright qi, returns through the seventy-two seasonal nodes, drives the sixty-four hexagrams’ yin tally, and drums the twenty-four qi’s yang fire. Then the three hun guard the form, the seven po return to the body, and the twelve thousand spirits within the body all heed the command—this is called the ten revolutions returning the numinous, the myriad qi ascending together as immortals.\n\nWhen the ten recitations are complete, the perfected great spirits of the ten directions of the Limitless arrive simultaneously. The men and women of the land turn their hearts in devotion, coming like fine rain and dense mist. The boundless hosts press upon half the land, causing the earth to sink everywhere—none can prevent it. When the recitation of the scripture is complete after ten cycles, the great spirits of the ten directions all assemble at once. None among men and women fail to turn in devotion, like the crowds of fine rain and dense mist. Pressing upon half the land, filling half the country, the Heavenly Worthy’s majestic virtue is so weighty that the earth cannot bear it, sinking entirely—yet none can prevent it.\n\nWhen the ten revolutions’ work within the body is complete, one’s thoughts cease and spirit congeals, nature returns and life is restored—then true lead returns to the chamber. The qi of yin and yang within the body blend and fuse, steaming the four limbs like the moistening of rain and mist. Circulating through the six voids, moving above and below without constancy, coming and going without cease, the boundless hosts fill and saturate the space—though the land is pressed and the earth sinks, it cannot be stopped.",

      "translated_text": "Thus, the Primordial Beginning suspended a single precious pearl, vast as a millet grain, within the Void Mystery—five measures above the earth.\n\nMaster Xin said: The Primordial Beginning is one’s primordial spirit; the precious pearl is the heart. The Confucians call it the Supreme Ultimate, the Buddhists call it Perfect Enlightenment—yet it is the same principle. The Dao also names it the Mystery Pearl, the Heart Pearl, the Millet Pearl: all refer to this same thing. \"Precious\" signifies the most refined and true, meaning the numinous treasure. \"Vast as a millet grain\" describes how it encompasses the cosmos yet enters the finest hair-tip—what is called \"so great there is nothing beyond, so small there is nothing within,\" its transformations unfathomable. Thus it dwells within the Void Mystery, beyond all trace or pursuit.\n\nThe measure of five above the earth: five is the number of earth, the center of the Five Phases. Like the generative numbers of the Five Phases, the void center embodies the Supreme Ultimate. When the heart is empty, the primordial spirit resides there—this is the Void Mystery. Is this not the golden embryo of empty qi? Therefore, the Mystery Master said: This is the Jade Clarity Precious Pearl, the Dao of divine transformation and immortal embryo.\n\nAccording to Xiao Guanfu: The Primordial Beginning suspending the pearl means spirit and Dao are united. Earlier, the preaching upon the lion’s throne occurred when spirit congealed within the chamber, moving from non-being to being. Now, the pearl suspended in the Void Mystery transcends spirit beyond things, passing from being into non-being. All these are the Heavenly Worthy’s manifestations of wondrous transformation, revealing that within the most refined and subtle, the most wondrous Dao abides.\n\nThe Primordial Beginning then summoned the Heavenly Perfected, the Great Spirits, the Lofty Worthies, the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct, the Boundless Perfected Great Spirits of the Ten Directions, and the innumerable hosts—all entered into the precious pearl. Heavenly beings gazed upward and saw them bustling in through the pearl’s mouth; once inside, their whereabouts were unknown. The people of the land dispersed, and the earth returned to levelness, no longer sunken or slanted.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy suspended the precious pearl within the Void Mystery, summoning the Three Origins and Nine Sages, the Five Elders and Nine Perfected, the Heavenly Perfected Great Spirits, and the innumerable hosts—all entered the pearl. The heavenly beings gazed upward and saw them within the Void Mystery, within the Five Luminances, amid a hundred million rays of light. They saw them bustling in through the pearl’s mouth, yet once inside, the realm of the Void Mystery vanished from sight. Thus their whereabouts were unknown. The people of the land also dispersed in silence, and the earth became level, no longer sunken or slanted.\n\nThose who were not Heavenly Perfected or Lofty Worthies could not enter the wondrousness of the Void Mystery, only gaze upward in reverence. As for the Boundless Perfected Great Spirits of the Ten Directions and the innumerable hosts—all entered. Were these not heavenly beings?\n\nWhen one’s heart-pearl is luminous and clear, qi merges with spirit in darkness, gathering the myriad into one, then the innumerable hosts all enter through the mouth of one’s pearl. The six roots become still and silent, the solitary true emerges—how could any slant or sinking fail to return to levelness?\n\nWithin the precious pearl, the Primordial Beginning then expounded the scripture in full. The Perfected oversaw the transmission, bestowing it upon me. At that moment, joy and celebration defied words. The ritual matters were roughly complete, the myriad heavens returned to their positions, and in an instant, all was silent without lingering resonance.\n\nWithin the precious pearl, the Primordial Beginning finished expounding the scripture. The Perfected attended in vigil, and the transmission was conferred upon the Dao Lord. At that time, the Dao Lord’s joy and celebration defied words, beyond all naming or description. The ritual matters of the innumerable hosts were also complete, and the Perfected of the heavens all returned to their domains. Within the land, all was suddenly tranquil and still, silent without lingering resonance.\n\nWithin, the primordial spirit; at the center, a single qi; blending and fusing the nine apertures; illuminating the Golden Mother; gathering and refining cinnabar and mercury, returning them to the crucible. At this stage of practice, joy defies words. A moment’s work is complete, the myriad spirits return to their origin. In the dim and mysterious stillness, the image of the precious pearl also returns to the Ultimate Non-Being.\n\nAt that time, the heavenly beings who encountered the scripture’s teachings were universally delivered and saved, preserving their natural lifespans without premature harm. The entire land turned in devotion, all cultivating good hearts: no killing, no harm, no envy, no jealousy, no licentiousness, no theft, no greed, no desire, no hatred, no [lacuna]. Words were free of ornate embellishment, speech free of evil sounds. Equal in compassion and love, even those of different bones became kin. The land was at peace, the people prosperous, rejoicing in great harmony.\n\nAfter the Heavenly Worthy finished expounding the scripture and the heavens returned to their positions, all who heard the teachings were universally delivered and saved, preserving their natural lifespans without premature harm along the way. They all turned in devotion to the scripture’s teachings, swiftly cultivating good hearts. All killing and harm, envy and jealousy, licentiousness and theft, greed and desire, hatred and [lacuna], ornate words and evil speech were entirely purified. Thus, with compassion and love as one body, even those of different bones became kin. The land was at peace, the people prosperous, and all rejoiced in the image of great harmony.\n\nHuman nature is without exception good; its lack of goodness arises from being obscured by material desires and drowned in habitual qi. Thus, indulgence in depravity and excess flows unchecked, leading inevitably to harm of one’s natural lifespan. If one only pursues the hearts of killing and harm, envy and jealousy, licentiousness and theft, greed and desire, how can one know that the people are my siblings and all things share my qi? Approaching them with compassion and love, how could the land be at peace, the people prosperous, and all enjoy great harmony?\n\nThis is certainly what cultivators must guard against. Having heard the scripture’s teachings, one gathers the heart and congeals the spirit, taking self-cultivation and delivering others as the foundation. Over time, returning to the root and restoring life, emotions darken and nature becomes still—then one may hope for longevity and enduring vision. By restraining anger and blocking desires, governing emptiness and guarding stillness, diminishing again and again, in movement and stillness, speech and silence, there is nothing that is not good—then one will surely be able to refrain from killing and harm, licentiousness and theft.",
      "overlap_context": "ions’ work within the body is complete, one’s thoughts cease and spirit congeals, nature returns and life is restored—then true lead returns to the chamber. The qi of yin and yang within the body blend and fuse, steaming the four limbs like the moistening of rain and mist. Circulating through the six voids, moving above and below without constancy, coming and going without cease, the boundless hosts fill and saturate the space—though the land is pressed and the earth sinks, it cannot be stopped.",

      "translated_text": "Why then should there be extravagant adornments or harsh sounds? At this stage, all creatures—whether creeping, flying, or hidden—are embraced with compassion, without distinction of near or far. The state is like the body: when one harmonizes with the primordial qi, all things are nurtured. Even in assisting transformation and fostering life, or subtly supporting the imperial destiny, all arises from within.\n\nThus, governing the state in great peace and securing the realm of prosperous tranquility is achieved. When the scripture first emerged to teach a single nation, those who held the Dao with utmost sincerity, revered and honored its rites, all attained deliverance across the world. This speaks of the Heavenly Worthy’s initial proclamation of the scripture. When the people of a nation all follow the Dao in conduct, the teachings are thereby established.\n\nThe heart is the luminous clarity from kalpas past; though the teachings had not yet appeared, this heart was already complete—this is called \"preexisting.\" Yet, mired in illusion and delusion, it became obscured and lost. Now, through the deliverance of the scripture’s method, sudden awakening and liberation occur, nature returns to life, and destiny is restored. Once one follows the Dao in conduct, all delusions revert to truth.\n\n\"Revering and honoring\" means taking the source as fundamental. Like water flowing to the sea, all returns to its origin. \"Honoring with rites\" signifies profound reverence and faith. Thus, all attain deliverance across the world. If one forgets the root and chases the branches, abandons the source to seek the stream, how can one achieve deliverance?\n\nThe scripture is the path of the Dao; the heart is the Dao’s source. By aligning with the scripture and gathering the heart, one grasps the scripture’s subtleties.\n\nThe Dao states: The words spoken by the Primordial Heavenly Worthy in the scripture are the hidden rhymes of the inner names of the Heavenly Emperors, as well as the secret taboos of demon kings and the concealed names of the hundred spirits—these are not ordinary worldly terms.\n\nThe inner names of the Heavenly Emperors refer to the names of the Thirty-Two Heavens. The imperial taboos are the inner sounds of the Jade Characters of the Heavenly Emperors. The hidden rhymes are the natural numinous verses of the heavens, as mentioned in the scripture. The inner taboos of the demon kings refer to the Five Heavenly Demon Kings: Ba, Yuan, Chou, and Bo. The hidden names of the hundred spirits include Wu Ying, Bai Yuan, Tao Kang, and He Yan. All these were proclaimed by the Heavenly Worthy and transmitted by the Dao Lord—beyond the knowledge of worldly mortals.\n\nTurning inward to seek, as in the alchemical classics: solar essence and lunar spirit, Metal Tiger and Wood Dragon, mercury and cinnabar, red lead and black tin, yellow sprout and white snow, the maiden and the infant, the yellow matron and the golden lord, yang fire and yin tally, the mysterious pass and the earthen cauldron, the furnace and the trigrams—though their names and designations vary, they are but the primordial true unity of qi, the ancestral elixir. Without a master’s guidance, how could the foolish comprehend?\n\nThe perfected sages, having attained realization, penetrate the profound and exhaust the subtle, mastering all its verses. Reciting it ten times, the heavens echo from afar, and the myriad emperors pay homage. Rivers and seas grow still, mountains and peaks conceal their clouds. The sun and moon pause their radiance, the celestial pivot ceases its turning. Demon hosts bind their forms, ghostly spirits lose their clarity. The dead revive, white bones become flesh—this describes the efficacy of the perfected one’s recitation.\n\nThe \"perfected sages\" refer to the lofty immortals of the heavens, whose wondrous practices and sacred merits are already complete, requiring no further cultivation. The \"perfected ones\" achieve this through diligent practice, refining spirit and nurturing qi, ultimately merging with the natural—transcending being and non-being, forever escaping birth and death. Having thoroughly investigated the profound and awakened to the obscure, they fully grasp the scripture’s mysteries, such as the *Hun Dun Chi Wen* and the *Five Falling Scripts*.\n\nHaving mastered these, reciting it ten times summons the descent of the heavens, the observation of the myriad emperors, all echoing the jade sounds and honoring the inner taboos. None fail to revere the scripture’s intent and praise its merit. Thus, rivers and seas halt their waves, mountains and peaks withdraw their mists, the sun and moon pause their wheels, and the stars cease their radiance. Demon hosts retreat, ghostly spirits and demons hide—all effects of recitation, eliciting such great responses. Even the dead revive, white bones become flesh; though souls and spirits may have perished, they are reborn through the scripture’s power.\n\nThe efficacy of ten recitations in the alchemical path corresponds to the ten months of gestation, when the spirit is transformed.\n\nThe \"heavens\" here signify the inner fusion of true lead, with all spirits in harmony. The \"rivers, seas, mountains, and peaks\" represent the river of love and the sea of desire. If one’s singular truth is revealed, all illusions dissolve—then the waves of the river of love subside, and the billows of the sea of suffering grow calm. The \"sun, moon, and celestial pivot\" signify the great samadhi’s divine light, illuminating the eight consciousnesses—thus, external demons submit, and inner demons vanish. At this stage, the living body is delivered, and the dead soul is refined—how could there be no power to revive the dead?\n\nFor the devoted scholar who recites it ten times, the Five Emperors stand guard, the Three Realms bow in reverence, demonic spirits lose their sight, ghostly beings vanish, and those on the brink of death are delivered to new life—this describes the efficacy of the devoted scholar’s recitation.\n\n\"Devoted scholars\" are those of utmost dedication in their studies. The immortal master said: The devoted scholar’s heart is firm as iron and stone, their resolve unyielding in water or fire—beyond the reach of heaven and earth, unshaken by ghosts or spirits. They practice what others cannot, unwavering in their efforts. Thus, reciting the scripture ten times, the spirits of the five qi stand guard, the Three Realms heed their command, and even demon kings bow in submission and vouch for them.\n\nThis is the result of the devoted scholar’s accumulated merit and established deeds. In subduing demons, demonic spirits cower and dare not meet their gaze—thus, they lose their sight. With demon kings vouching for them, ghostly beings and demons bind their forms and vanish. Through this, those on the verge of death are delivered and revived.\n\nTurning inward: the Five Emperors are the spirits of the five viscera; the Three Realms are the three corpses, the six thieves; demonic spirits and ghostly beings are the seven emotions and six desires. If one can dispel desires and calm the heart, reducing thoughts and curbing cravings, then the heart grows still, the spirit clear, essence complete, and qi firm. The five viscera find peace, the three corpses are eradicated, the six roots purified, and all thoughts dissolve into emptiness.",

      "translated_text": "When inner demons are stilled, outer demons naturally disperse. Through the work of refining the self, one delivers those on the brink of death—where true qi reaches, even the lifeless may revive. This is the response of the ten transgressions within the body as the foundation of the elixir gradually takes form.\n\nThe reason for this lies in the fact that the scholar’s impure qi has not yet dissipated, and their body has not attained thorough realization. Though they summon and command the ten directions, their power is not yet sufficient to govern the celestial administration, yet their virtue may subdue and restrain the earthly deities, binding demonic spirits. However, they can only avert death, not restore life. This describes the ordinary practitioner whose efforts in cultivation and recitation have not yet reached fruition.\n\nThe celestial administration refers to the sun, moon, and five planets—collectively known as the Seven Governors. The earthly deities are the spirits of mountains, rivers, shrines, and altars. Ordinary practitioners, unable to diminish desires and clarify the heart, remain burdened by impure qi, their nature and principle still obscured; thus, their bodies and natures cannot attain thorough realization. The reason for this is their inability.\n\nFor those of advanced learning, whose cultivation and recitation have reached efficacy: though they summon and command the deities of the ten directions, their power may not yet move the celestial administration, yet their virtue can suppress and master the earthly deities, capturing and subduing demonic spirits. This is sufficient to avert death and prolong life, but not yet to attain the Dao of immortality. For their spirit is dull, their qi turbid, their substance impure, and their thoughts deluded. Though they may perform rites to shield against eclipses, avert the five planets, sever inauspicious stars, quell droughts and floods, slay dragons and mirages, summon rain and snow, or recede tides—any matter concerning the celestial administration—they cannot control its responses. The earthly deities, not yet having verified their celestial rank, can only be subdued by their virtue.\n\nIf the scholar’s cultivation and recitation are earnest, not a single thought arises, and all entanglements instantly cease, directly attaining the realm of the precious pearl—is this not thorough realization? To recite this chapter lightly brings misfortune. Through reverent offering and worship, one’s household flourishes, prosperity endures across generations, and good karmic conditions arise. Ten thousand calamities do not intrude, and divine spirits guard the gate. This warns of the consequences for ordinary learners who neglect their practice.\n\nTo recite this chapter lightly is to profane the scripture woven from the three heavens’ celestial qi, its cloud-seal dragon-script not of this world’s common speech. If one recites it carelessly, the offense of disrespect will surely invite misfortune. Even for the Three Caverns’ scriptures, one must gather the heart and focus the spirit, reciting without negligence—how much more so for this text?\n\nThus, Xue Youqi said: Without aligning the body, without following the rites, reciting while standing or sitting improperly—this is irreverence. To recite without reverence is worse than not reciting at all.\n\nMaster Xin admonished: At the outset of recitation, gather all thoughts into one—this is the Primordial Beginning’s summoning of the ten directions. To recite with right mindfulness is the Primordial Beginning’s expounding of the scripture. When the mind of emotions and perceptions does not wander, it is the ten directions listening to the teaching. When all delusions return to truth, it is the heavens and humans receiving deliverance. This teaching is perfect.\n\nFor ordinary learners who cultivate with sincerity, offer reverent worship, and observe utmost respect, their households will prosper outwardly, and their bodies and minds will find peace inwardly. Across generations, their prosperity will endure without cease. With the utmost accumulation of good deeds, every action aligns with fortune; disasters do not strike, and evil retreats. They will surely feel the protection of divine spirits.\n\nThis scripture is most venerable, unmatched in the Jade Capital. It delivers countless beings and is the root of all Dao. Its majestic model and virtue are beyond measure. *The sound ascends.*\n\nMaster Xin said: Great is the *Scripture of Salvation*! It is not composed by mere writing. Though all scriptures may perish when kalpas end, only this text remains in the Jade Capital.\n\nHe also said: From ancient times to the present, no sage, immortal, or buddha has attained the Dao without upholding the methods of the *Scripture of Salvation*. Among all scriptures, the *Primordial Beginning’s Scripture of Salvation* is the supreme text.\n\nFor since the Primordial Beginning first generated the heavens at the dawn of the kalpa, its Crimson Writ of Chaos and Numinous Chapters of the Void have illumined the Three Luminaries, encompassed the ten directions, unfolded the Five Scripts, and expanded the myriad models. The birth of heaven and earth, the nurturing of the ten thousand things—all arise from this as the root of heaven and earth. It can summon countless celestial perfected beings, innumerable hosts, all entering within a single grain of millet. Thus, it is the root of all Dao, the boundless, universally delivering without end. Therefore, it is most exalted and wondrous, uniquely the supreme scripture of the Jade Capital. Its majestic virtue cannot be fully recorded.\n\nThis scripture is the path by which a thousand perfected beings and ten thousand sages cultivate; from it emerge a thousand methods and ten thousand gates. Thus, it endures through ancient and modern times without decay, existing before heaven and earth. When expanded, it fills the six directions; when gathered, it does not exceed a handful. This is what the Buddhists mean when they say that the infinite worlds and boundless wondrous meanings are all contained within the tip of a hair. There is no other reason: it is the original true nature from before the beginning of kalpas. How could it not be most exalted and wondrous?\n\nThus, its boundless and infinite greatness and virtue cannot be limited or fully described. If one cultivates it, how could they not stand unmatched in the Jade Capital?",

      "translated_text": "Master Xin says: The scripture is transmitted through the heart and realized through the heart—students should naturally examine it with discerning eyes to its ultimate meaning.\n\nThe Dao teaches: Whoever recites this scripture ten times will summon all the celestial beings; the suffering souls of their countless ancestors and departed kin in the dark realms will all be delivered, ascending to the Crimson Palace. After nine years of refinement, they will be transformed and reborn as noble persons. Those who diligently study the scripture, accumulating merit until their virtue is complete, will all attain immortality, ascending to the Golden Gates and roaming the Jade Capital.\n\nThis teaching is not limited by one’s station or worth—merely reciting it ten times can bestow the merit of delivering one’s ancestors and departed kin. \"Countless ancestors\" refers to all parents from the beginning of kalpas, the progenitors of innumerable lives and eons. \"Suffering souls\" are those trapped in the long night of the underworld, yet to be delivered. The Crimson Palace is the Southern Palace of Nanchang. The Vermilion Mound is the Fire Bureau.\n\nRefinement follows three grades: the superior student achieves deliverance in three years, the middling in nine, and the lesser in twenty-four. The merit of recitation is not bound by one’s capacity or wisdom—if one can focus the mind and recite it ten times, the power of the scripture will summon the descent of all celestial beings and the arrival of myriad spirits. One’s countless ancestors and the suffering souls of others will all be delivered, ascending to the Crimson Palace, instantly transformed by the scripture’s power. They will be reborn through the middling grade of refinement, becoming noble persons, born into noble families and spared from descent into lower realms.\n\nHaving attained rebirth, their innate spiritual awakening will be further cultivated through accumulated merit, and only then will they ascend to the three divine realms. Thus, those who persist in diligent study and recitation, accumulating merit day by day and month by month until their virtue is complete, will secure their spirit with the Jade Talisman and refine their form with the Golden Elixir. Over time, both form and spirit will attain perfection, and they will serve the Golden Gates and Jade Capital.\n\nSuperior students who recite this scripture will be delivered immediately, ascending to the Southern Palace. The Most High said: \"The superior person, upon hearing the Dao, diligently practices it.\" For superior students, who have planted good roots in past lives, their cultivation and recitation are unwavering from beginning to end. Their ceaseless progress and profound merit allow them to be delivered in their present form, preserving their life and rooting their existence. Unbound by refinement grades, they ascend directly to the Southern Palace.\n\nMaster Youlou says: When the hun and po ascend as immortals, the ghostly substance is refined by fire; when one is delivered in their present form, the filth of the body is refined by fire. Thus, those who practice diligently have their names recorded in the immortal registers, all ascending in spirit to the Southern Palace before attaining perfection—this is assuredly not difficult.\n\nFor ordinary mortals who recite the scripture, it extends their lifespan and grants long years; after death, they attain the way of *shijie*, their souls temporarily extinguished yet spared from hell, swiftly regaining form and roaming the great void. This describes the effects of recitation for common people. Those of ordinary station who recite it over time, silently comprehending its essence, may prolong their vitality and extend their years. After their bodies perish, they too attain *shijie*. Though their souls temporarily dissolve, their accumulated good karma ensures they avoid the suffering of hell, swiftly regaining form in the great void, their spirits delivered to the Vermilion Mound.\n\nAll this is granted by the blessings of past lives. Though mortals may recite with sincerity, without understanding the principles of refinement, they can only attain a long lifespan. When their allotted time ends, they still return to the cycle of birth and death. If their form attains *shijie*, their spirit escapes the wheel of rebirth, unbound by the underworld’s dark realms. Shedding their form and traces, they restore their true nature within the yin qi, their spirit transcending the empty vastness to roam the celestial realms.\n\nThis scripture is wondrous and subtle, universally delivering boundless beings—all celestial and human realms receive its blessings. Its immeasurable fortune extends even to the dead. The earlier praise of its exalted subtlety is now reiterated. The Dao Lord’s compassion is boundless, hence its infinite power of deliverance. Those who cultivate it with devotion, through the scripture’s merit, bring blessings to all celestial and human beings, even delivering the suffering souls of ancestors. Its boundless fortune is limitless, benefiting both the living and the dead. Once delivered, even the souls of the deceased undergo refinement—thus, both life and death receive the Heavenly Worthy’s grace.\n\nYet the scripture’s subtlety is inherent in all; without personal cultivation and the tenfold refinement of the self, how could it universally deliver all beings? If one can realize the scripture’s teachings in the heart and attain the subtlety of the Golden Elixir, over time, the tenfold spiritual revolutions will summon the ten directions. Then, even the distant departed will be liberated from their bodily forms, ascending to spiritual transformation—how could they not receive blessings in both life and death?\n\nHeaven treasures this scripture and does not transmit it to the lower world. Only the most devoted scholars, offering gold and treasures with sincere hearts, may swear an oath to heaven to receive it. Those who lightly disclose or profane it will bring calamity upon nine generations, condemned to eternal servitude as ghostly officials. The Dao Lord’s strict prohibitions reveal how this scripture is treasured and concealed in heaven.\n\nXiao Guanfu says: The Three Caverns’ true scriptures are recorded in the Golden Registers, hidden in the Mysterious Capital and revealed but once in ten thousand kalpas. In ancient times, when the kalpic fortunes were dire and the world’s paths obstructed, the Tortoise Mother of the Western Terrace petitioned the Jade Capital. Thereupon, the Jade Emperor Dao Lord entrusted it to the Perfected One of Primordial Unity; the Perfected One of Primordial Unity transmitted it to the Perfected One of the Great Ultimate, Xu; and the Perfected One of the Great Ultimate passed it to Master Ge Xuan, who disseminated it in the world. Thus, what heaven treasures and conceals is not something lesser scholars can comprehend.\n\nOnly the most devoted scholars—those of utmost learning—must offer gold and treasures to break their miserly hearts, deepening their reverence so they value the scripture as dearly as gold and jewels. Heaven’s treasures bear hidden names and secret taboos, written in vermilion script and cavernous chapters. The devoted scholar’s offerings of gold and treasures dispel stinginess and foster cherished devotion, ensuring they regard the scripture with the same love as precious treasures.",

      "translated_text": "Should one recklessly divulge, leak, or treat it with irreverence, how could one not bring calamity upon their ancestors and forebears, suffering interrogation by the ghostly officials?\n\nThe Perfected Master said: \"Recklessness\" means transmitting it to the unworthy; \"divulgence\" means practicing it without secrecy; \"leakage\" means failing to guard it steadfastly; \"irreverence\" means serving it without devotion. If any of these four occur, the body shall suffer calamity. The ghostly officials are those whom heaven dispatches as thunder-driving, lightning-summoning officers; earth assigns as sand-carrying, stone-bearing laborers; and water appoints as wave-drawing, abyssal attendants—where the souls of the dead are held accountable.\n\nWhen one receives this scripture, the Five Emperors assign twenty-four jade lads and twenty-four jade maidens to encamp and guard its divine writ, protecting the body of the recipient. This speaks of how the devoted scholar, through recitation and cultivation, invokes the protection of the Celestial Emperors and the Perfected Immortals.\n\nMaster Shaowei said: The Five Emperors are the Five Venerable Celestial Sovereigns. When the Five Emperors attend the scripture, they descend from the flying heavens to observe, commanding one hundred twenty jade lads and maidens to encamp and guard its writ, protecting the body of the one who wears and recites it. Most cultivators of the Dao are obstructed by external demons, easily wavering and retreating, so that many grow lax midway. Since the Perfected Lord has warned of the retribution for divulgence and irreverence—issuing stern admonitions—He also entrusts divine spirits to encamp and guard the sacred writ, protecting the recipient, thereby dispelling demons and warding off misfortune. The Heavenly Worthy’s compassion is truly all-encompassing. How can scholars of cultivation fail to embody His teachings, faithfully receive, uphold, and maintain them, avoiding the fault of divulgence and irreverence?\n\nThe Dao declares: In the first month, observe a prolonged fast and recite this scripture to sever the earthly bonds of past generations’ souls, releasing them from the toils of the underworld and ascending them to the Southern Palace. In the seventh month, observe a prolonged fast and recite this scripture to attain immortality, inscribing one’s name in the registers of the heavens—yellow writs and white tablets—erasing death and ascending to life. In the tenth month, observe a prolonged fast and recite this scripture to secure the peace of kings, emperors, rulers, ministers, fathers, and sons, stabilizing the nation’s destiny and ensuring the heavens endure eternally. Generation after generation, one shall remain a sovereign, bringing tranquility to the realm and its people, who shall praise it as a reign of great peace.\n\nThis speaks of the efficacy of recitation and cultivation on the Three Origins, the Eight Nodal Days, and one’s own life-destiny day. The first month’s Upper Origin is a month of great celebration, the first of the four beginnings, when the Builder of the Yin (Tiger) governs the ghostly path. Thus, one should recite to deliver the souls of past generations, severing the bonds of earthly officials and releasing them from the toils of ghostly labor, ascending them to the Southern Palace. The seventh month’s Middle Origin is a month of great celebration, when the Builder of the Yang (Monkey) governs the human path. Thus, one should recite to deliver oneself, inscribing one’s name in the heavenly registers, transcending death and ascending to life, recorded upon yellow writs and white tablets.\n\nMaster Shaowei said: These are the celestial records of immortals. The tenth month’s Lower Origin is a month of great celebration, when the Builder of the Celestial Gate (Boar) governs. One should then recite to protect kings, emperors, rulers, ministers, fathers, and sons, ensuring the nation’s peace, its destiny enduring, and its sovereignty unbroken through generations. The realm shall be tranquil, free from plague and pestilence, and the people shall extol it as a reign of great peace. For the Three Origins govern the Three Palaces, the Nine Bureaus, and the one hundred twenty offices, which examine and tally sins and blessings, all under their jurisdiction. Thus, for the nation’s destiny first, then one’s ancestors, and finally oneself, one should observe a prolonged fast and recite the scripture during these months, praying for blessings and deliverance. Heaven and earth shall rejoice, the living and the dead shall receive grace, and boundless blessings shall be attained.\n\nOn the Eight Nodal Days, reciting this scripture enables one to become a Perfected One of the Nine Palaces. On one’s life-destiny day, reciting this scripture purifies the hun-soul and spirit, ensuring the eternal preservation of the ten thousand qi, sparing one from suffering and affliction, and endowing the body with radiant light. The Three Realms shall attend and guard, the Five Emperors shall await and welcome, the ten thousand spirits shall pay homage, one’s name shall be inscribed in heaven, and upon the fulfillment of merit and virtue, one shall ascend to the Upper Clarity.\n\nThe Eight Nodal Days—four commencements marking the start of the seasons and the two equinoxes and solstices as the transitions of yin and yang—are when the Three Realms examine and tally sins and blessings, as recorded in the immortal scriptures. It is said: On these days, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy dispatches Celestial Emperors, Heavenly Lords, divine immortals, and legions of spirit-soldiers to transform and deliver all beings in the human realm. The Northern Dipper, the Southern Bureau, the Four Offices, and the Five Emperors also descend to record sins and blessings. All beings imbued with qi undergo transformation on these days—flying, walking, creeping, and wriggling creatures, those of water and land, those that soar and sink—responding to karmic conditions, altering the old and embracing the new. What was light may become heavy, what was heavy may become light; good and evil may reverse, and the workings of qi and phenomena unfold naturally. Scholars of the Dao should on these days cultivate sincerity, offer prayers of gratitude, adapt to change, rectify conduct, abandon falsehood for truth, deliver all beings, and nurture the ten thousand things. Thus, they should recite, uphold, and revere the scripture, striving to cultivate fortune and dispel misfortune, advance goodness and cast out evil, pursue brightness and forsake darkness, rouse their resolve to seek truth, inwardly accumulate true merit, and outwardly practice substantive deeds, thereby avoiding the retribution of sins and blessings.\n\nThe Eight Nodal Days correspond to the Eight Trigrams and the Nine Palaces; thus, reciting the scripture on these days enables one to become a Perfected One of the Nine Palaces. One’s life-destiny day occurs six times each year when the descent occurs. The three hun-souls reside in the liver, belonging to wood, and their number is three—hence the three hun-souls. The seven po-souls reside in the lungs, belonging to metal, and their number is seven—hence the seven po-souls. Of the three hun-souls in the human body, one dwells in the original constellation’s palace, one in the underworld, and one within the physical form. The seven po-souls constantly depart yet do not scatter. On one’s life-destiny day, the hun-souls descend into the body to join the corpse, circulating and returning without cease, ensuring the person’s peace and stability, free from disaster and illness. If on this day one purifies body and mind, abstains from wine and lust, wears clean garments, burns incense, and cultivates goodness, and further, rests briefly, then the hun and po shall unite, yin and yang shall harmonize, the Dao-qi shall flourish within, and the root of life shall be firmly established.",

      "translated_text": "If one indulges in wine and lust, confounding and disordering the physical form, then when the hun-souls return, they halt three paces from the body, unable to unite. Foul qi fills the frame, and the hun-souls, returning again, are thrice confounded by disorder. Failing to join the po-souls, yang wanes while yin waxes, and the hun-souls commune with yin spirits, giving rise to night-wandering in evil dreams, deep slumber and confusion, and the onset of disaster and illness.\n\nShould one on their life-destiny day perform purification rites and recite scriptures, the above-mentioned responses shall manifest. When merit is fulfilled and virtue perfected, the Three Realms shall provide escort, the Five Emperors shall officiate the reception, and one shall await ascension.\n\nThe Azure Prime declares: When a person commits myriad evils, the hun-souls grow wrathful and the divine spirits depart the body, knowing they shall together enter the evil paths. When one performs all manner of good, the hun-souls rejoice and the hundred spirits gather, knowing they shall together enter the true path. Those who cultivate learning—can they not be cautious?\n\nThe Dao states: On the day of practicing the Way, one should bathe in fragrant waters, fast, enter the chamber, face east, and knock the teeth thirty-two times to ascend the report to the thirty-two heavens, bowing in the heart thirty-two times. Closing the eyes and settling the mind, one sits amidst clouds of green, yellow, and white qi, both within and without shrouded in mist. Green dragons, white tigers, vermilion birds, dark warriors, lions, and white cranes array themselves to left and right. Sun and moon illuminate the chamber, its interior radiant, while atop the head a circular image forms, its light suffusing the ten directions—all vividly present.\n\nOn days of scripture recitation, one should first don ritual attire, wash the hands and rinse the mouth, purify the heart and still the thoughts, enter the chamber, sit facing east, and recite with focused mind and measured gaze. The voice should be soft, ensuring harmony of spirit and soul, qi settled and breath regulated. Then knock the teeth to summon the spirits within and reach the heart of heaven without. Bow to the thirty-two heavens, close the eyes and inwardly visualize, sitting amidst the primal three qi of the Mysterious Origin. Within and without radiant, one visualizes green qi from the liver emerging through the eyes, transforming into a green dragon on the left; white qi from the lungs issuing from the nose, becoming a white tiger on the right; red qi from the heart flowing from the mouth, forming a vermilion bird before; and black qi from the kidneys passing through the ears, manifesting as a dark warrior behind—all arrayed to left and right. The left eye aligns with the sun, the right with the moon, their light illuminating the chamber. Atop the neck, a circular image of nine colors emits rays, its brilliance enveloping the ten directions.\n\nThe *mizhou* states:\n*Mi* means \"low voice,\" and *zhou* means \"prayer.\" Master Moyin says: From \"Supreme Mysterious Origin\" below to \"before the Most Honored One’s seat,\" this is the whispered prayer, and no separate incantation need be recited. The *Tanluo Yuluo* are later additions—how could they be fitting to recite? Moreover, one must not proceed too swiftly, lest in haste to complete the count, the qi grows turbid and the voice clamorous, turning reverence into irreverence.\n\nSupreme Mysterious Origin, Most High Dao Lord, summon forth from within my body the Three-and-Five Merit Officers, the left and right attending messengers, the incense-bearing golden youths, the jade maidens who transmit words, the Five Emperors’ direct talismans, and the incense officials of the day—thirty-two of each—let them emerge to report my words. Today is an auspicious day, a day of prolonged fasting and pure hall, of cultivating the supreme scripture to deliver boundless beings. I, [Name], recite this scripture for rebirth, praying that this report ascend directly to the Most High, before the seat of the Primordial Lord of the Thirty-Two Heavens.\n\nUpon completion, draw qi thirty-two times and face east to recite the scripture.\n\nThe Supreme Mysterious Origin is the collective term for the Three Realms. As the recitation is dedicated to the Primordial Origin, one first invokes the Dao Lord, visualizing him within the *niwan* palace atop one’s head. The Three-and-Five Merit Officers and other spirits within the body are visualized emerging and arraying themselves to left and right, front and back—one for each heaven, thirty-two in all—each reporting in turn. The report’s content should align with the prayer, sincerely stating the matter. \"Today is an auspicious day of prolonged fasting\": today is [specific day], an auspicious day; if not a prolonged fast, simply say \"a day of fasting.\" \"Pure hall, cultivating the supreme scripture\": if one is not versed in the covenants of the Three Caverns and has not practiced regularly, merely say \"pure hall, reciting the scripture.\" \"Delivering boundless beings\" refers to the ten directions, seen and unseen; if reciting for a specific matter, say \"reciting the scripture for [matter].\" \"I, [Name]\": omit if for oneself; omit if for another. \"Directly before the seat of the Primordial Lord of the Thirty-Two Heavens\" refers to the thirty-two Heavenly Emperors and the Primordial Lord’s seat. Drawing qi thirty-two times likewise entails one breath for each heaven. Facing east signifies the beginning of generative qi.

      "translated_text": "**The Orthodox Unity Lineage of the Dao, Transmitted Teachings of the Dao Merged with Non-Action, Illustrious Ancestor and Model of Radiance, Perfected Zhang, Forty-Third Celestial Master Zhang Yuchu, Annotator**\n\n*The Supreme Primordial Wondrous Scripture of Limitless Salvation* – this is the title of the true scripture.\n\nThe true scripture was spoken by the Primordial, hence it is simply titled *The Supreme Primordial Wondrous Scripture of Limitless Salvation*. This is the title placed by the Dao Lord at the scripture’s beginning. \"Primordial\" clarifies that this scripture was spoken by the Primordial Heavenly Worthy. \"Limitless salvation of beings\" encapsulates the scripture’s fundamental purpose. As this scripture holds the highest rank among all scriptures, it is called *The Supreme Wondrous Scripture*.\n\n*Primordial Cavern-Mystery, Numinous Treasure Original Chapter*:\n\"Primordial\" is the origin of the One Qi, the beginning of the myriad transformations, the title of the Heavenly Worthy of the Primordial Void in response to the world. Prefacing the original chapter with \"Primordial\" clarifies that all is the speech of the Primordial Heavenly Worthy. \"Cavern-Mystery\" is one of the Three Caverns, a designation for scriptural ranks. \"Numinous Treasure\" is the title of the Dao Lord. The Dao Lord names the scriptural treasure, for all scriptures are expounded by the Dao Lord. The Treasures of Dao, Scripture, and Master existed prior to heaven and earth, all transformed and born from the Three Qi of the Mysterious Primordial. Thus, this scripture was also formed from the Three Qi of Brahma-Purity and Radiant Scenery, condensed into cloud-seal celestial chapters, which the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign then transcribed into scriptural text.\n\nThe Primordial abides within the empty cavern of the mysterious void, speaking this scripture, which is the root of all Numinous Treasure scriptures and stands at their head, hence called the *Original Chapter*. Cultivated internally, it is another name for the Great Elixir of Golden Liquor. Congealing spirit as numinosity, gathering qi as treasure, the roots and dust thoroughly illumine one’s primordial spirit, enduring through past and present without decay—this is the original foundation of the precelestial True One.\n\n*Supreme wondrous beginning, ten revolutions to save beings; a hundred demons conceal their rhymes, separation and union arise naturally.*\n\nMò’ān says: This is the brief preface to the true scripture. \"Supreme wondrous beginning\" refers to the highest rank among scriptures, the foremost of all wonders. \"Ten revolutions to save beings\": ten is the generative and completive number of the Five Phases, a principle inherent in all things. To save humans or spirits, one must revolve ten times, cycling endlessly, and only then does the spirit achieve tenfold reversion. \"A hundred demons’ virtuous rhymes\": Shǎowēi says: \"Demons\" here are not malevolent demons or demonic ghosts. They include the Great Demons of the Five Emperors, the South Pole’s Longevity and World-Saving Sīmǎ, and other deities. Thus, in the Numinous Treasure incantations, the True Kings, Vermilion Numinosity, and Azure Radiance are all listed alongside the Great Demons of the Five Heavens. \"Concealed rhymes\" refer to hidden names and taboo terms. \"Separation and union arise naturally\": the sounds of concealed rhymes, now divided, now united, arise spontaneously without fixed traces.\n\nFor the precelestial One Qi transforms and generates the myriad beings—one root branching into ten thousand, this is union; ten thousand branching back to one root, this is separation. Revolving endlessly, cycling without beginning or end, the workings of creation cannot be discerned. In the Dao of the elixir, after ten months the embryo is complete, and the spirit transforms, following the same path as heaven and earth, sharing the same mechanism as creation—all taking ten as the complete number. In human cultivation, the greatest difficulty lies in the six roots, eight consciousnesses, three hun souls, seven po souls, and the gods of the three regions and eight landscapes. These, when stirred, become demonic trials, disturbing the sovereign heart, their separation and union in tumult, never resting. Once one knows the work of cultivating ten revolutions, the hundred demons are subdued, returning to the natural state.\n\n*Primal Chaos Red Writ, Non-None Supreme Perfected, Primordial Ancestral Kalpa, Transforming and Generating the Myriad Heavens, Illuminating the Three Radiant Sceneries—This is the Root of Heaven.*\n\nAbove, there is no further ancestor; only the Dao is the body.\n\nShǎowēi says: The section before \"naturally\" is the Dao Lord’s brief preface; from \"Primal Chaos\" onward is the Heavenly Worthy’s original chapter. \"Primal\" means undifferentiated chaos; \"Chaos\" means emptiness without substance. This refers to the time before the separation of Primal Chaos, when the One Qi was gestating within the empty cavern. \"Red Writ\": *The Scripture of the True Writ in Red* states: The Cavern-Yang Qi is red, hence it is called the Red Writ. All are the Qi of the precelestial and the essence of the utmost Yang, manifesting as images.\n\nThe Five Elder Thearchs say: The Primordial Cavern-Mystery Numinous Treasure Red Writ was born before the Primordial, within the empty cavern, in profound obscurity. Without ancestor or lineage, Qi congealed and floated in the void, responding to the moment and the occasion—this is it. \"Non-None Supreme Perfected\": the Qi originates from the beginning of the Great None. The scripture says: \"None, and even none is none.\" The most supreme of the supreme, the truest of the true—this is what is meant by \"born before heaven and earth.\" \"Ancestor\" refers to ancestral Qi. A kalpa is one formation and one dissolution of heaven and earth; the ancestral kalpa is the beginning of the world’s formation, before any dissolution has occurred. The Mysterious Primordial Qi is the ancestor of the myriad things. The Five Hundred Million Heavens are all transformed and generated from ancestral Qi. The scripture says: \"The Dao is the mother of the myriad things.\"\n\nXiāo Guānfù says: From the One Qi, the Three Realms are established; from the Three Realms, the Nine Heavens are born. Below each of the Three Realms, three heavens are generated, totaling thirty-six heavens. Below these are the Four Kinds of Human Heavens, then the Three Realms and Twenty-Eight Heavens, then the Eight Brahma Heavens, extending to the Five Hundred Million Heavens—all have ancestral Qi as their root.\n\n\"Illuminating the Three Radiant Sceneries\": The Three Realms are the Three Heavens of Pure Tenuity, Cosmic Resonance, and Great Vermilion. The Three Radiant Sceneries are also called the Three Lights: sun, moon, and stars. They are the Three Poles of heaven, earth, and humanity; the Three Powers; the Three Realms. The Most High says: The Dao generates the One—this is the One Qi. The One generates the Two—these are the Two Modes. The Two generate the myriad things—these are the Three Radiant Sceneries. The Three Qi combine to form the Nine Qi. The Three Qi are the ancestors of heaven and earth, the roots of the myriad things. All are transformed and generated from the ancestral kalpa, and only then are heaven and earth illuminated and born—this is the Root of Heaven.",

      "translated_text": "Above, there is no further ancestor—only the Dao as its own body. The Dao takes emptiness and nothingness as its essence, and cannot be sought through form; this is called a forced name. Thus, it is without shape or name, without sound or scent, vast enough to embrace heaven and earth, capacious enough to encompass the cosmos. That which has no ancestor above it is the Dao. The Confucians call it the Supreme Ultimate; the Buddhists call it True Emptiness; the Daoists call it the Great Void—yet their principle is one.\n\nIn human cultivation, one gathers ancestral qi from the primordial beginning, coalescing it into the Golden Mother. Circulating through the Six Voids, it is the intermingling of the Two Qi, opening and closing without cease. Over time, one pursues the Two Qi along the Yellow Path, uniting the Three Natures in the Original Palace. Then the essence of the Two and Five exquisitely conjoins and congeals, generating endlessly to form the Dharmakāya—this is the primordial Heavenly Root.\n\nThe Five Scriptures unfold and expand, universally planting spiritual numina. Without scripture, there is no illumination; without scripture, there is no clarity; without scripture, there is no establishment; without scripture, there is no completion; without scripture, there is no deliverance; without scripture, there is no generation. This is the Heaven within the Great Brahmā Heaven. The Five Scriptures are the Five Chapters of True Writ, the very texts of the Five Chapters’ dissemination. From them, heaven is generated and earth is established; flying and hidden, moving and still, all creatures possessing consciousness—every being with form and qi—are transformed and born. Thus, since the division of yin and yang, their scriptures have unfolded and expanded, universally planting the ten thousand kinds.\n\nThe Five Scriptures in heaven become the Five Stars; on earth, the Five Peaks; in humanity, the Five Phases; in things, the Five Qi. No entity, from the vastest to the most minute, is not encompassed within them. Without these scriptures, there is no illumination or clarity, no establishment or completion, no deliverance or generation—then heaven and earth and the myriad things would have no mechanism for the workings of creation.\n\nThe human body is a small heaven and earth, yet more numinous than the myriad things. The primordial One Qi is the foundation of the elixir; the Five Phases are arrayed within the crucible. Metal and Wood intermingle; Water and Fire unite in harmony; the Two Earths serve as the regulator. Within this, yin and yang are inverted, and the Hexagram of Already Crossing is achieved. When emotion returns to nature, mercury is cast into lead; when the medicine meets fire, cinnabar is produced from silver—all with the Golden Mother as their root. Flowing from wù to jǐ, upon encountering Earth, the elixir is formed.\n\nOnce the elixir is complete, its spirit and numinous transformations are unfathomable—all is the full embodiment of the Five Phases. Its radiance is like the brilliance of the sun and moon; its establishment is like the founding of heaven and earth. That which can deliver and generate is the Primordial Beginning—this is the Heaven within the Great Brahmā Heaven, encapsulating the purport of the preceding scriptural passages, hence it is said to be so. The Great Brahmā is the Great Flowing Brahmā Qi. The Heaven within Heaven is the Heaven among the Thirty-Two Heavens—none is not pervaded by the flowing Brahmā Qi, circulating without cease, just as the One Qi within the body cycles endlessly. All is the flowing of the Mandate of Heaven, the hundred vessels and nine orifices—nowhere does it not return. This is the universal distribution of Brahmā Qi.\n\nYuluo Xiao Terrace, Jade Mountain’s Upper Capital—above, it reaches the utmost, the Great Luo of Jade Purity, vast and boundless through kalpas, now present, now absent. Above the Great Luo Heaven lies Jade Capital Mountain, a capital made of jade, hence called Jade Mountain’s Upper Capital. The Yuluo Terrace stands above the Jade Capital, reaching the highest and most distant—above even the utmost. This is the Heaven of the Great Luo. Within it dwells the Jade Purity Golden Gate, its vastness without limit, embracing the ten thousand realms. Thus, it is boundless through kalpas, impossible to exhaust. Yet the Brahmā Qi congeals in emptiness, not to be sought through form or image—this is called \"now present, now absent.\" For every formation and dissolution of heaven and earth is one kalpa. The realm of the Great Luo was inaugurated before the empty kalpas and remains unbroken through kalpas. *Rèn* cannot be measured or limited. Its vastness and indistinctness are one with the Great Void—without shape or name, not to be sought through traces.\n\nWithin the body, Yuluo Xiao Terrace is the region of the brain. Jade Mountain’s Upper Capital is the Mud Pill Palace. The Mud Pill is the Gate of Heaven, the mansion of the ten thousand spirits—this is the scene of the Great Luo, with Jade Purity dwelling within, vast and boundless through kalpas, now present, now absent. One’s true nature is vast and without sign, a thing within the indistinct—enduring through vast kalpas, the so-called indestructible primordial spirit. Thus, it resides above the Three Realms.\n\nThe Three Flowers depart and separate, the Great Possession’s Wondrous Court—Golden Gates and Jade Chambers, a forest of purity and limpid pools. The Great Flowing Brahmā Qi circulates through the ten directions. Master Youqi says: The Three Flowers are the Three Primordial Palaces of Jade Purity. The Upper Primordial Jade Flower, the Middle Primordial Golden Flower, the Lower Primordial Nine Flowers—here dwell the Three Primordial August Lords of the Dao, the detached palaces of Jade Purity. The Great Possession is the Highest Great Possession Jade Purity Palace, where the Heavenly Worthy presides, hence called the Wondrous Court. Three is the number of the south, the fire phase, belonging to *lí*—this is the Mud Pill region of the brain. The Golden Gates and Jade Chambers are the Crimson Palace of the Yellow Court. The forest of stars is the constellations of the celestial circuit. The limpid pools are the two ponds’ crystalline clarity—within the body, these are *kǎn* and *lí*. The Great Flowing Brahmā Qi circulating through the ten directions is the scene of the Great Luo and Jade Purity, the Brahmā Qi flowing universally through the boundless realms of the Ultimate Non-Existence. The ten thousand things all receive its moisture; the One Qi of the Primordial Beginning transforms and generates endlessly.\n\nThe Elixir Scriptures say: The Three Palaces merge and unite, gathering the Three Natures in the Original Palace. The body’s spirit, qi, and essence are the Three Flowers. The primordial spirit resides within the Numinous Terrace—this is the Wondrous Court of the Great Possession. My golden tower and jade chamber are the Golden Gates and Jade Chambers of heaven. The Five Stars and constellations, the forest of radiance within the limpid pool waters—this is the celestial fire time, the constellations and stars encircling the ascent and descent of *kǎn* and *lí*, water and fire. Within the Qian-Kun crucible, between the state of Already Crossing, the Way of the Ninefold Return of Golden Liquid is accomplished.",

As it traverses the sixty-four hexagrams in full cycle, the hundred meridians return to the Origin, the nine orifices become luminously clear—is this not the pervasive circulation of the Brahman Qi, suffusing all ten directions, all becoming the scene of the limpid pool?\n\nWithin it abides the spirit that delivers people from death; within it dwells the Lord of Longevity of the Southern Culmen; within it resides the Great Divine Marshal who delivers the world; within it abides the Life-Nurturing Elder Han Jun; within it are the Lords of Destiny and Record of the Southern Upper Realm, who extend life and augment destiny, the Venerable Spirits who deliver from calamity—reanimating the bones and reviving the dead, delivering boundless multitudes.\n\nToday is the day of celestial reckoning, as the hosts of heaven descend in state.\n\nMò’ān says: This speaks of the assembled hosts of heaven, examining the merits and transgressions of scholars. The Master of Immortals says: The Brahman Qi circulates throughout the ten directions’ domains, and within these ten directions are deities who preside over the deliverance of the world from death—this does not mean the deities themselves are immortal.\n\nThe Lord of Longevity of the Southern Culmen is the Great Lord of Longevity of the Southern Culmen, who governs the Register of Life. It is also said: He is the Great Emperor of the Vermilion Mound.

The Life-Nurturing Elder Han Jun governs the Upper Palace of Southern Prosperity, overseeing the Register of Longevity. The Lords of Destiny and Record of the Southern Upper Realm, who extend life and augment destiny, and the Venerable Spirits who deliver from calamity—\"Southern Upper\" is another name for the Grotto-Yang Palace, also called the Upper Palace of Southern Prosperity or the Venerable Spirits of the Vermilion Mound Fire Mansion, namely the Six True Lords of the Southern Dipper. From \"within it abides the spirit that delivers people\" to the Southern Culmen’s various perfected ones, though each is assigned to a specific office, all possess the power to reanimate the bones and revive the dead, delivering people across kalpas without limit. Thus, world-deliverance is boundless.\n\nThe spirits within the body each reside within the Crimson Palace, the Mysterious Pass, and the Mud Pill Palace—hence it is said \"within it.\" The so-called Southern Culmen and Southern Prosperity are the heart. The scripture says: The boundless great spirits all arise from my own body. The adept who refines the Golden Liquid and tempers the form will thereafter attain the wondrous union of form and spirit, and may circulate through the ten directions, delivering the world, averting calamity, reanimating the bones, and reviving the dead.\n\n\"Today is the day of celestial reckoning\"—\"today\" refers to the first kalpa of the Red Clarity, the day of unfolding the register and reckoning in the Great Floating Li Land. It is the day of weighing transgressions and blessings, recording merits and faults, when the divine kings and great sages of the ten directions descend in state to assemble, heeding the Heavenly Worthy’s proclamation of deliverance.\n\nThe Boundless Flying Heavenly Divine King, Great Sage of Longevity, and Boundless Deliverer of the Eastern Direction;\nThe Boundless Flying Heavenly Divine King, Great Sage of Longevity, and Boundless Deliverer of the Southern Direction, Flying;\nThe Boundless Flying Heavenly Divine King, Great Sage of Longevity, and Boundless Deliverer of the Western Direction, Cloud;\nThe Boundless Flying Heavenly Divine King, Great Sage of Longevity, and Boundless Deliverer of the Northern Direction, Mirrorless;\nThe Boundless Flying Heavenly Divine King, Great Sage of Longevity, and Boundless Deliverer of the Northeastern Direction, Brahman;\nThe Boundless Flying Heavenly Divine King, Great Sage of Longevity, and Boundless Deliverer of the Southeastern Direction, Nāyu;\nThe Boundless Flying Heavenly Divine King, Great Sage of Longevity, and Boundless Deliverer of the Southwestern Direction, Delivering Immortals;\nThe Primordial Ultimate Flying Heavenly Divine King, Great Sage of Longevity, and Primordial Boundless Deliverer of the Northwestern Direction, Juéwú;\nThe Boundless Flying Heavenly Divine King, Great Sage of Longevity, and Boundless Deliverer of the Upper Direction, Ying;\nThe Boundless Flying Heavenly Divine King, Great Sage of Longevity, and Boundless Deliverer of the Lower Direction, Luo.\n\nThe Flying Heavenly Great Sages of the ten directions are all emanations of the Primordial Beginning’s Dao-realm, transformed through qi.\n\nBīnghú Xū Xiùzhāo says: The Great Sages of Longevity of the ten directions are the Heavenly Worthies of Salvation from Suffering of the ten directions. From the day of unfolding the register, they receive the Primordial Beginning’s mandate to oversee the reckoning of merits in the ten directions and three realms, delivering boundless multitudes, encompassing life and death, and refining adepts.\n\nThe *Daoist Canon* states: In the eight directions, all heavens contain boundless great-thousand worlds. The Boundless Heavens of the Eastern Direction contain the Great Thousand World of Āndà Tángxiāng, the Realm of Gathering Goodness; the Boundless Heavens of the Southern Direction contain the Great Thousand World of Wǎnlí Chéngjìng, the Realm of Abandoning the Worthy; the Boundless Heavens of the Western Direction contain the Great Thousand World of Fútáng Zhōu, the Realm of Universal Conduct; the Boundless Heavens of the Northern Direction contain the Great Thousand World of Yùdān Yě, the Realm of Purity; the Boundless Heavens of the Northeastern Direction contain the Great Thousand World of Fújídū, the Realm of Eternal Peace; the Boundless Heavens of the Southeastern Direction contain the Great Thousand World of Yuánfútián, the Realm of Primordial Goodness; the Boundless Heavens of the Southwestern Direction contain the Great Thousand World of Yánfú Xiāng, the Realm of the Seven Tranquilities; the Boundless Heavens of the Northwestern Direction contain the Great Thousand World of Fúdé Yě, the Realm of Extending the Worthy; the Upper Direction contains the Thirty-Six Heavens of the Upper Clarity Jade Perfection and the Boundless World of Xuándū; the Lower Direction contains the Thirty-Two Heavens of Huángzēng and the Eight Round Boundless Worlds.\n\nIt is also said: The hosts of the Five Marchmounts, the Five Emperors, the Grotto-Yin, the Pure Numinous, the Northern Capital, and the Luòfēng’s various offices—these Flying Heavenly Divine Kings of the ten directions all hold the office of bestowing longevity and delivering the world. Thus, they are called the Great Sages of Longevity. From kalpa to kalpa, they deliver people to attain the Dao and achieve perfection without limit—this is called the Boundless Deliverer of People.\n\nThe perfected Flying Heavenly Divine Kings of the ten directions, the boundless great spirits of longevity and world-deliverance, all ride upon flying clouds. Their cinnabar chariots and green canopies, jade wheels and feathered parasols, are drawn by vermilion phoenixes and five-colored dark dragons. They bear nine-colored standards and ten spirit-streamers of absolute purity. Ahead, nine phoenixes cry in unison; behind, eight simurghs sing in harmony. Lions and white cranes roar and chant in melodious chorus.\n\nAll these are the Flying Heavenly Divine Kings of the ten directions and the boundless great spirits—all are the perfected of heaven.\n\nQīngyuán says: Chariots, canopies, wheels, and parasols are all formed from the qi of yang essence; phoenixes, dragons, lions, and cranes are all transformations of the qi of yin essence.

      "translated_text": "When the practice of returning the elixir reaches completion, the yin demons are also transformed. With a single breath of the yang spirit’s primordial qi, the ten thousand spirits all heed its call. The divine spirits of the five viscera each manifest in their directional colors. Chariots, brushes, and ceremonial escorts come to welcome the hundred bones, with the host of spirits leading and following, ascending to pay homage at the Origin—no different from the assembly of the Heavenly Perfected and Great Sages. The Five Elders clear the path, while the multitude of immortals flank the carriage, myriad chariots and ten thousand riders arriving upon the floating void.\n\nAs the radiant light pours forth and the celestial chariot turns back, they oversee the Perfected and deliver the living. The Great Sages of the ten directions, exalted in their Dao ranks, are thus moved to have the Five Emperors lead the way, with the throng of immortals as their attendants—hence the myriad chariots and ten thousand riders arrive upon the floating void, riding the luminous scenery.\n\nThe Five Elders are:\n- The Eastern Azure Spirit, First Elder, surnamed Guan, named Kai, styled Lingwei Yang;\n- The Southern Cinnabar Spirit, True Elder, surnamed Dongfu, named Jiyan, styled Chibiao Nu;\n- The Central Primordial Spirit, Primordial Elder, surnamed Tongban, named Yuanshi, styled Han Shuniu;\n- The Western Radiant Spirit, August Elder, surnamed Shangjin, named Changkai, styled Yaopo Bao;\n- The Northern Dark Spirit, Mysterious Elder, surnamed Heijie, named Linghui, styled Yin Houju.\n\nThe Five Emperors are all naturally divine Heavenly Perfected, transformed from the wondrous workings of the ancestral qi into the five phases—these are the five qi. Thus they are called the Primordial Five Elders, not those who attain Perfection through accumulated study. From the moment they receive their mandate and descend with their talismans, each presides over a direction. Only when the great kalpas cycle anew do their positions change.\n\nTherefore:\n- The East pertains to Wood, governing spring, commanding the birth of the myriad things;\n- The South pertains to Fire, governing summer, commanding the growth of the myriad things;\n- The Center pertains to Earth, flourishing in all four seasons, harmonizing the myriad things;\n- The West pertains to Metal, governing autumn, commanding the fruition of the myriad things;\n- The North pertains to Water, governing winter, commanding the storage of the myriad things.\n\nThis is what is meant by the orderly distribution of the five qi. The five phases are the upright qi of the Dharmakāya. The Fire Dragon and Water Tiger, in inverted flow, circulate within the crucible. When the ten thousand spirits gather in the Nine Palaces, the five qi pay homage at the Origin, and the hundred numina guard the body—just as the thousand chariots and ten thousand riders arrive upon the floating void.\n\nThe \"pouring light\" refers to the flowing essence of jade radiance. The \"turning chariot\" refers to the flying clouds of the cinnabar firmament. When the Great Sages of the ten directions assemble at the Emperor’s abode, their wheel hubs revolve, and the Heavenly Honored One’s dharma throne oversees the host of Perfected, examining and measuring the ranks of all beings.\n\nWithin, one turns the true light inward to illumine the numinous palace. When Kan and Li are conjoined, lead and mercury merge, the spirit does not stray outward, and the six reins are all stilled. Only then does the yang light pour downward, the yin dregs refine upward, and the true spirit transform and generate, naturally overseeing the Perfected and delivering the living, circulating through the ten directions.\n\nThe Chancellors of the Various Heavens, the Southern Palace of Supreme Prosperity, the Han Director of Records, and the Great Spirit Who Oversees Birth—all holding registers and ledgers—gather before the Emperor. According to those who ought to be delivered, they strictly examine the heavens. Mo’an says: This describes the assembly of the various heavens to review the merits and transgressions of scholars and the karmic fortunes of worldly people.\n\nThe Chancellors of the Various Heavens are the Divine Lords of the Great Ultimate of the Boundless. The Southern Palace of Supreme Prosperity is the Vermilion Numinous Fire Mansion, located in the Heaven of Radiant Harmony and Yang Brilliance. The Han Director is the Venerable Han Elder, who oversees the refinement and registration of records. The Great Spirit Who Oversees Birth holds the office of delivering souls and bestowing rebirth. The registers and ledgers record the merits, transgressions, sins, and blessings of scholars and worldly people. The various subordinate spirits, bearing the registers and ledgers, assemble before the Heavenly Honored One to measure merits and bestow blessings, universally delivering humans and devas.\n\nThey examine those who ought to be delivered:\n- Some, whose names are inscribed in the Mysterious Chart from past lives, possess bone configurations suited for immortality;\n- Some, through fasting and upholding precepts, have accumulated merits and evoked resonance;\n- Some, through revering the Three Treasures, have amassed virtuous deeds that reach the heavens;\n- Some, through offering to the Teacher and the Treasure, have been commended by the Three Officials.\n\nThose whose names are recorded in the various heavens undergo strict examination of their ledgers. Based on their merits, their ranks are measured, and according to their superiority or inferiority, they receive promotion and deliverance.\n\nGuanfu says: The above is the main text, narrated by the Jade Dawn Dao Lord. It universally creates the Three Realms, the Boundless Divine Homeland, the Yellow Springs’ Curved Mansion, the Northern Capital of Fengdu, the Three Officials and Nine Bureaus, and the Twelve River Sources.\n\nThe Three Realms are the Realm of Desire, the Realm of Form, and the Formless Realm. The Boundless Divine Homeland refers to the boundless worlds of the ten directions. The Yellow Springs’ Curved Mansion is the long-night mansion of the Nine Dark Regions. The Northern Capital of Fengdu is a great sea in the lower realm’s true north, filled with foul and putrid vapors, its boundaries unfathomable. Within it stands a mountain, its summit piercing the azure heavens and its base descending into the wind springs, formed from the coiled black vapors—this is called the Northern Capital of Fengdu Mountain. There is a great cavern called the Palace of Yin Radiance. Within it lie thirty-six hells, governed by the Heavenly Lord of Grand Yin. Inside are six caverns, each presided over by a Great Demon King of the Six Heavens:\n\n1. The Palace of Zhōu’s Absolute Yin,\n2. The Palace of Tài’s Lethal Judgment,\n3. The Palace of Míng’s Enduring Offenses,\n4. The Palace of Tián’s Illuminating Sin,\n5. The Palace of Zōng’s Seven Transgressions,\n6. The Palace of Gǎn’s Daring Connections.\n\nIf one can uphold the names of these six caverns with constant reverence and awe, the demon kings will protect and recommend them, erasing their sinful names. In life and death, they will receive blessings without end.\n\nThe Three Officials and Nine Bureaus refer to the Offices of Heaven, Earth, and Water, which govern the Three Primes and examine the records. The Upper Prime’s Heavenly Official is subordinate to the Jade Clarity Realm, establishing three palaces, nine bureaus, and thirty-six departments. The Middle Prime’s Earthly Official is subordinate to the Highest Clarity Realm, establishing three palaces, nine bureaus, and forty-two departments. The Lower Prime’s Water Official is subordinate to the Grand Clarity Realm, establishing three palaces, nine bureaus, and forty-two departments. The officials and subordinates of the Middle and Lower Primes are all souls of the deceased who have accumulated merits, received deliverance, and obtained positions. They serve according to their term limits, and upon fulfilling their merits, ascend to the heavenly bureaus. Those whose merits are incomplete return to be reborn among humans.",

      "translated_text": "The Nine Bureaus are also called the Nine Mounds of the Earthly Sovereign’s Nine Commands. The Twelve River Sources refer to the moon as the essence of the Great Yin and the mother of all waters; the Eastern Well is the source of the Celestial River, where all waters converge. The Great Yin completes one revolution of the heavens each month, thus passing the Eastern Well in all twelve months, where it showers the sweet dew of the Yellow Blossom to cleanse and refine the souls of the dead. These souls also rely on this process to purify their forms before ascending to the Southern Palace for deliverance.\n\nThe human heart is the Southern Prosperity, which is the Vermilion Mound Palace. As the scripture states: *\"The boundless light of the Numinous Treasure illumines the scorching pools of affliction.\"* When the heart is empty, the divine light shines through. Below the kidney region lies the dark and winding Palace of the Hidden Yin Springs, which is the Northern Capital of Fengdu.\n\nBy employing my true light to illuminate the darkness and circulating the true water of the Great Yin from the Eastern Well to cleanse the hidden souls, they are then tempered with the true fire of the Southern Li of the Great Yang. Thus, even the ethereal souls of the Realm of the Utmost Divinity are universally delivered.\n\nThis practice absolves the sins of ancestors and parents across countless kalpas, swiftly erasing their names from the ledgers of transgressions and extinguishing the roots of evil, preventing them from being confined or forced into the ranks of ghosts. The ancestors of humanity—if their descendants fail to cultivate goodness and accumulate virtue—will inevitably suffer calamities, sinking into the depths with no hope of escape. However, those who know to uphold the teachings of the scriptures, turn toward goodness, and spread blessings will absolve the sins of their ancestors and distant kin, enabling all to attain deliverance.\n\nThe *Guān Fù* states: *\"Whenever the Three Officials conduct their records, if descendants perform great deeds, the Jade Emperor issues a decree to immediately deliver the nine generations of ancestors and the seven lineages of forebears.\"* When one person receives deliverance, nine generations of ancestors receive grace. Thus, their names are swiftly erased from the ledgers of transgressions, and the roots of evil are extinguished.\n\nThe *roots of evil* refer to the inherent nature of wicked thoughts, while the *ledgers of transgressions* are the records of sins—both minor and grave—kept by the underworld authorities. Through the mercy of deliverance, their karmic burdens are greatly pardoned, the roots of evil are eradicated, and their names are stricken from the records. Even the underworld authorities cannot detain them or force them into the ranks of ghosts. All kin across countless kalpas ascend through universal deliverance.\n\nThose who know the path of cultivation are not swayed by worldly vanities or clouded by desires; their essence remains serene, their nature perfectly attuned and luminously wondrous. Thus, the Three Corpses and Six Bandits cannot disturb them with defilement. With prolonged cultivation, the myriad qi gather at the Gate of Life, and the hundred spirits guard the Gate of Death, preventing them from sinking into the bitter realms. Countless generations of ancestors and forebears all ascend in turn.\n\nThe Mandate of the Primordial Beginning ensures timely ascension. The Cold Pool of the Northern Capital oversees the protection of form and soul, restrains demons, and recommends deliverance to the Southern Palace. Refined souls of the dead are transformed into immortals, while the living who receive deliverance endure across kalpas. As the kalpas turn, they share the same lifespan as Heaven, forever escaping the Three Paths, the Five Sufferings, and the Eight Difficulties. They transcend the Three Realms and roam freely in the Highest Clarity.\n\n*Mò Ān* says: *\"This speaks of the refinement of the scholar’s ancestors and the deliverance of the scholar themselves.\"* The Mandate of the Primordial Beginning, such as the Heaven-Granting Precious Register of the Numinous Treasure tradition, the Nine Dragon Talismans for Salvation from Suffering, and the various true talismans and writs, are all decrees issued by the Primordial Heavenly Worthy to the Nine Heavens and Nine Offices, commanding their enforcement across the Three Realms and the Ten Directions. Thus, ascension occurs at every moment.\n\nThe Cold Pool of the Northern Capital is the winding Hidden Springs of Fengdu. *Overseeing the protection of form and soul* means that when a person dies, their form perishes and their soul scatters; the Northern Emperor, by decree, oversees and protects the departed souls to prevent their dispersal. By restraining and instructing the Demon Kings to recommend them, they are delivered to the Vermilion Mound of the Southern Palace. The refined souls of the dead, dwelling in the darkest and most yin of palaces, receive the compassionate light of the Heavenly Worthy. When a single spark of true yang is kindled within, the darkness is illuminated, yin is purified, and yang is made whole. Thus, they are transformed into immortals.\n\nThose who cultivate the scriptural teachings and refine their form and spirit receive deliverance in life, preserving their human form across kalpas and ensuring the eternal existence of their true nature. *As the kalpas turn, they share the same lifespan as Heaven* means that while the kalpas inevitably decay and those bound by form and qi are subject to the cycle of rebirth, the enlightened ones—whose wondrous essence is beyond form—remain unbroken across endless kalpas, sharing the same longevity as Heaven and Earth.\n\n*Forever escaping the Three Paths, the Five Sufferings, and the Eight Difficulties*: The Three Paths are the first, the Gate of Sensual Desire, the celestial path of the Upper Corpse; the second, the Gate of Attachment, the human path of the Middle Corpse; and the third, the Gate of Greed, the earthly path of the Lower Corpse. These are also called the Three Evils, which obstruct the path to immortality. The Five Sufferings are: sensuality burdens the heart, attachment burdens the spirit, greed burdens the form, vanity burdens the essence, and the body burdens the soul. Together with the Three Paths, these constitute the Eight Difficulties.\n\nThose who know the Way of returning to the root and restoring life, who gather their emotions and return to their nature, abandoning delusion to return to truth, purify their Three Actions and Six Roots, revealing the singular truth while all illusions dissolve. By circulating the primordial qi of the Primordial Beginning within the union of Kan and Li, they refine the soul and forge the spirit, severing the earthly root to realize the heavenly root. Thus, the souls of the dead receive refinement, the living receive deliverance, and the Three Realms cannot bind them. They instantly transcend the leakless and roam freely in the realm of the Highest Clarity.\n\nThe Heaven of Highest Clarity is ruled by the Jade Perfected Heavenly Emperor, a realm of formless purity and ascetic practice. *Yōu Qī* says: *\"Among the heavens of Highest Clarity, the thirty-six Heavenly Emperors are the most exalted.\"* Their Dao is equal to that of the Primordial Beginning, and their rank is among the Jade Clarity. Thus, they are called the Jade Perfected. This refers to the thirty-six heavens below Highest Clarity, distinct from the thirty-two heavens. They possess radiance but no form, hence they are called *ascetic practice*.\n\n*Ascetic practice* is the Dao within the Dao, the Heaven within Heaven, transcending all barriers, the unobstructed true emptiness. The *Dragon’s Hoof Scripture* also states: *\"The twelve heavens of Highest Clarity are the abodes of the Nine Perfected, where the Jade Perfected Heavenly Emperor reigns as the sovereign of the heavens.\"* His body is crystalline and luminous, his qi governs the utmost truth. Through pure cultivation, he is called the Jade Perfected.",

As they engage in carnal desire and the union of yin and yang, this is called the Realm of Desire. Due to their indulgence in pleasure, they swiftly decline and decay; when their lifespans end, they sink once more into the various destinies. Those who cultivate and purify the six sense roots may ascend to the Realm of Form, which is the Middle Realm.\n\nThe Realm of Form consists of eighteen heavens, from **Transcendent Balance Heaven** to **Vow-Pledge Heaven**. The beings of these heavens possess six colors and eighteen dusts—six coarse dusts, six fine dusts, and six subtle dusts. When one dust is purified, they ascend one heaven; when all eighteen dusts are purified, they ascend to the Formless Realm, which is the Upper Realm.\n\nThe **Perfect Unity True Regulations** states: In the Formless Realm, the perfected are without emotion, do not engage in yin-yang union, and are born through transformation. They subsist solely on true qi, no longer possessing physical form. Upon attaining the first heaven, they preserve only mind and consciousness to enter qi-contemplation; if mind and consciousness are dissolved, they ascend in succession. If all habitual tendencies are forgotten and they are unattached to existence or nonexistence, they penetrate into spontaneity and ascend to the **Seed-People Heaven**. When the great kalpa turns, water and fire do not reach them, only the vast wind. From **Filial Might Heaven** to **Cloud-Passage Heaven**, the six heavens are destroyed by wind. From **Primal Cavern Heaven** to **Elegant Joy Heaven**, the primal qi disperses and recombines, beyond all kalpas.\n\nFrom **Constant Fusion Heaven** to **Pacified Nurturance Heaven** are the Four Seed-People Heavens, where one penetrates the true Dao. Thus, the **Scripture of the Origin** states: \"When habitual tendencies are exhausted, one transcends the rank of the Seed-People Heaven.\" The **Perfect Unity True Regulations** says: Ascending the four heavens, one penetrates the realm of the Dao, rising and falling with the qi, untouched by calamity.\n\n**Xue Youqi** says: The thirty-two heavens of the four directions are the Four Brahma Heavens. The Heavenly Emperors and Perfected Ones possess distinct forms, yet though their true appearances exist, they move in and out of emptiness without obstruction. For the four directions each contain eight heavens, all formed from accumulated Brahma-qi. The inner names and hidden taboos of each Heavenly Emperor are likewise manifestations of Brahma-qi congealing in emptiness. The Heavenly Worthy expounds these to deliver the world—hence the inexhaustible establishment of scriptural teachings, upon which the cycles of birth and death depend.\n\nThe thirty-two heavens, thirty-two emperors, hidden taboos of the heavens, hidden names, hidden rhymes—all are the naturally resonant numinous chapters of the heavens’ emptiness, the sounds within the heavens, the venerables within the heavens, the spirits within the heavens, the great demons within the heavens, the numina within the heavens. Nine harmonizes with ten, transforming to ascend to Highest Clarity, an unfathomable profundity beyond full comprehension. The divine perfected are dispersed to universally deliver heavenly and mortal beings.\n\n**Mo’an** says: These names and taboos of the Heavenly Emperors are the wondrous manifestations of the heavens’ empty void, naturally formed from qi. Within the thirty-two heavens are thirty-two emperors, and the hidden taboos, hidden names, and hidden rhymes of the heavens are all formed from Brahma-qi congealing in emptiness—this is the \"intermingled void-qi\" spoken of in the *Chapter on Generating the Spirit*, hence called the *Naturally Numinous Chapters*. The sounds within the heavens are the lingering echoes of the hidden rhymes. The venerables within the heavens are the thirty-two emperors. The spirits and numina within the heavens are all the wondrous functions of Brahma-qi, ineffably divine. The great demons are the Five Heavenly Demon Kings.\n\n\"Nine harmonizes with ten\": Nine is the completion of yang numbers; ten is the culmination of yin numbers. This is the function of yin and yang. By fully realizing the wondrous workings of yin and yang, one achieves boundless transformation and directly attains the realm of Highest Clarity. Highest Clarity is the ethereal, pure qi, belonging to the celestial image; *Qian* is the utmost of the six yang, the harmony of nine; *Kun* is the utmost of the six yin, the union of ten. The marvels of the Great Elixir’s fire talisman are fully contained herein. The unfathomable profundities cannot be exhaustively described—these are the hidden taboos and hidden rhymes that cannot be fully recounted.\n\n\"Dispersing the divine perfected\" refers to the meaning of \"dispersal\" in the five sections below. The \"divine perfected\" are the spirits within the heavens. The wondrous patterns and profound models are expounded and unfolded within the empty void, thus universally delivering heavenly and mortal beings, who receive the blessings of life and death.\n\nSome take this as the preface of the **Jade Dawn Dao Lord**, recounting what Yuanshi Tianzun has spoken—these are all essential passages of the true scriptures, not to be interrupted and then resumed.\n\nToday is a joyous occasion of receiving deliverance, passing through the various heavens, beseeching the extinction of the Three Evils, severing the earthly root, flying through the Five Gates, having one’s name recorded in the Great Mystery, with the Demon Kings overseeing and lifting restrictions at the Heavenly Gates.\n\n\"Today\" refers to the day when Yuanshi Tianzun transmitted the scripture to the Dao Lord. The Dao Lord joyously received deliverance, passing through the various heavens. On the day the Heavenly Worthy expounded the scripture, all the heavens assembled—this was the occasion to proclaim to the heavens, commanding them to compassionately deliver beings, extinguish the Three Evils, sever the earthly root, pass through the Five Gates, and thereafter have their names recorded in the Great Mystery.\n\nThe Three Evils are the Three Wretched Paths.",

      "translated_text": "The *earthly root* refers to the fundamental nature within the hells. The *Five Gates* are the Five Sufferings. Once humans and heavenly beings receive deliverance through the scriptural teachings, the Three Evils and Five Gates are all eradicated, and the root-nature of the hells is likewise severed. Thus, their names are recorded above in the Jade Capital of the Mysterious Metropolis, and the Demon Kings of the Three Realms all act as guarantors, ascending through the Heavenly Gates without further restraint.\n\nThose who cultivate the scriptural teachings and inwardly illumine the Dao of the Ten Revolutions of the Great Elixir—with the Three Actions and Six Roots wholly purified—find the wheel of suffering and the bonds of sin entirely dissolved into emptiness. Once the Golden Mother germinates and the sacred embryo is perfected, true *qi* flows through all the heavens. The yang spirit departs the body, the Three Realms merge as one, and even the mighty Demon Kings raise their hands in praise and submission, ascending through the Heavenly Gates without hindrance. How then could the earthly root remain unsevered? Yet this cannot be attained without the utmost accumulation of merit and practice. If one’s movements are obstructed by external demons, the earthly root cannot be cut—how much less could one transcend and enter the Heavenly Gates? Let the scholar take heed.\n\nThe Eastern Dipper governs fate, the Western Dipper records names, the Northern Dipper decrees death, the Southern Dipper grants life, and the Central Dipper, the Great Chief, oversees all spirits. The Eastern Dipper has five stars, the Western Dipper four, the Northern Dipper seven, the Southern Dipper six, and the Central Dipper three. Some take the seven lunar lodges of the east, south, west, and north as the Four Directional Dippers, with the Northern Dipper as the Central Dipper. As the *Treatise on the Celestial Offices* states: \"The Dipper is the Emperor’s chariot, revolving at the center, governing the four directions, and observing omens.\" The *True Unity Formula* also says: \"Within the Dipper itself are five dippers: Yang Brightness is the Eastern Dipper, Yin Essence the Western Dipper, Cinnabar Prime the Southern Dipper, the Northern Culmen the Northern Dipper, and the Celestial Pass the Central Dipper.\" The teachings hold that Heaven takes the Dipper as its heart, hence it is said: \"The Heavenly Curses point where it turns, day and night without cease.\" The Central Dipper’s Great Chief is the Chief Star, and thus the Northern Dipper is called the Celestial Pivot, rightfully occupying the center as the sovereign of all spirits. Hence it oversees all spirits.\n\nHumans take the heart as their Dipper; the heart’s seven orifices mirror the Dipper’s number. The heart resides at the center of the body, governing the five organs and serving as the abode of spirit and luminosity. Once the scholar of Heaven and humanity receives deliverance, the Four Dippers inscribe their fate, record their names, decree death, and grant life, while the Central Dipper presides over all, with myriad spirits guarding the body. For those who refine the elixir, the fire tally of the celestial cycle is inwardly activated by the Celestial Stem, circulating through the twenty-eight lunar lodges and seventy-two seasonal nodes. With yang fire and yin tally in harmonious balance, the elixir is perfected and the Dao fulfilled.\n\nThe Azure Emperor guards the hun-soul, the White Emperor attends the po-soul, the Vermilion Emperor nurtures *qi*, the Black Emperor circulates blood, and the Yellow Emperor presides at the center, with all spirits subject to none other. Mo’an says: \"This speaks of the correlative body, corresponding to the *River Chart*. The wondrous interplay of the Three and Five is the body of generation and completion.\" The Five Emperors in Heaven are the Five Phases; on Earth, the Five Peaks; and in humans, the spirits of the five viscera. The Azure Emperor’s surname is Chang, his given name Jingming, and he guards the hun-soul, governing the liver. The White Emperor’s surname is Hun, his given name Zangshou, and he attends the po-soul, governing the lungs. The Vermilion Emperor’s surname is Yan, his given name Dongdan, and he nurtures *qi*, governing the heart. The Black Emperor’s surname is Xuan, his given name Mingmeng, and he circulates blood, governing the kidneys. The Yellow Emperor’s surname is Ma, his given name Zhongshen, and he presides at the Yellow Court, commanding all spirits.\n\nThe *Record of the Five Emperors of the Great Cavern* states: \"The Five Emperors exist coeval with Heaven and Earth. When yin and yang first divided, they transformed and gave birth to the Five Phases.\" In the numinous treasure teachings, they are the Five Emperors of red apricots, needle-grinding, sock-wax, and ink-blackness. The liver guards the hun-soul, restraining the three hun; the lungs attend the po-soul, controlling the seven po. The heart governs the nurturing of *qi*, the kidneys store essence, and when water and fire mutually support each other, the two *qi* unite. Those who receive deliverance undergo refinement and rebirth, as the Five Emperors descend their *qi*, transforming and generating the five viscera to complete the Five Phases. Thereafter, they ascend to the Southern Palace in graded ranks—this is the embryo of the five viscera coalescing into an infant. For those who refine the elixir, mastering the art of gathering and inverting the Five Phases, a single *qi* circulates through the Central Yellow Palace, and all spirits merge within the nine orifices. The Five Emperors descend their spirits to refine the golden liquor and descend their *qi* to coalesce the embryo. Over time, the Five *Qi* return to the origin, lead and mercury are captured and controlled, and they return to true earth—thus the elixir is perfected. The Immortal Master says: \"Essence, spirit, hun, po, and intent transform into purple gold frost.\"\n\nThe Azure Heaven Demon King is Bayuan Choubo; the Vermilion Heaven Demon King, Futian Danshi; the White Heaven Demon King, Fanshan Liumu; the Black Heaven Demon King, Jianchou Langfu; and the Yellow Heaven Demon King, Hengtian Danli. The Five Great Demon Emperors are the lords of all spirits. They fly and drum in procession, commanding ghostly legions, brandishing banners and beating drums as they roam the vast heavens. Proclaiming their own glory, all heavens acknowledge their merit. Ascending to deliver beings, they sternly govern the Northern Feng. The Divine Lords receive their mandate to universally sweep away inauspiciousness. The Eight Mighties spew poison, fierce horses spread in four directions. Heavenly Soldiers lead the vanguard, great marshals wield banners. Fire is hurled for ten thousand leagues, flowing bells resound in eight directions. Should any dare to challenge or obstruct the Perfected Ones, the Golden Axe executes them, the Giant Heavenly Queen metes out punishment. Ghostly wraiths are butchered, wind and fire never cease. Thousands upon thousands are beheaded, myriads upon myriads have their forms obliterated. Demons dare not trespass, ghosts dare not manifest as specters. The Three Officials of the Northern Feng clearly inspect the ghostly camps, permitting no concealment, as the Golden Horse relays the message. Universally proclaimed without end, all spirits heed the command. The Five Emperors of the Three Realms declare it to the Supreme Clarity.\n\nMo’an says: \"This speaks of the flowing function, corresponding to the *Luo Writing*’s nine-and-one numerology.\" The Five Heavenly Demon Kings’ four-character titles denote their positions, the middle two their given names, and the final two their courtesy names.

All preside over greed and desire, depleting and agitating the spirit’s qi, obstructing and corrupting the conditions of the Dao—hence they are called Demon Kings. The Five Great Demon Emperors are the Demon Kings beneath the Five Heavens. Dwelling at the head of the myriad spirits, they are called the Ancestors. They correspond to the five sense organs of the human body.\n\nThe *Hidden Writ of Jade Clarity* states: \"The Five Demon Emperors command their officials and subordinates, born together with Heaven, and constantly harass those who study the Dao, unwilling to see them succeed. They further boast before the Celestial Emperors of the various heavens, equating their sagely achievements. Later, during the Dragon Han era when the charts were revealed, they submitted to the transformation of the Primordial Beginning. Thus the *Hymn of Pacing the Void* says: 'The Demon Kings respectfully receive their duties, and thus are able to attend upon the various heavens.' This speaks of the Demon Kings composing songs to disrupt and confuse scholars. After submitting to the transformation of the Primordial Beginning, they thereafter specialized solely in testing through demonic trials. Flying and drumming, they lead their ghostly troops—this speaks of their flight through the Three Realms, drumming and commanding their ghostly soldiers as attendants. Waving banners and beating drums, they style themselves as resplendent. This speaks of their brandishing of flags and banners, dancing with standards and drums, roaming and observing above the Great Void, proclaiming their resplendent merit equal to that of the various heavens.\"\n\nWhen the heavens deliver humankind, they strictly command the Northern Feng—namely, the Northern Capital of Luo Feng. When the heavens open to deliver humankind, they first sternly admonish the ghostly officials of the Northern Feng, forbidding them to cut short lifespans or sever destinies. Following the transformative edicts of the Heavenly Worthy, they issue commands to the Ghostly Emperors, universally proclaiming to the gates of darkness, announcing restrictions and prohibitions, so that no harm may be wantonly inflicted upon beginning scholars. The Divine Lords receive their mandate and universally sweep away inauspiciousness.\n\nYouxi says: \"The Divine Lords are the Great Simplicity’s Boundless Divine Lords.\" When the Divine Lords receive their edict, the Five Great Demon Emperors sweep away inauspiciousness to protect and guard scholars. The Great Demons, bearing their mandate, employ the eight mighty divine dragons to spew poison and subdue evil, while fierce horses draw their chariots to spread in all four directions. Heavenly soldiers wield their orders at the vanguard, great marshals brandish banners in the rear, and the fire-ringing generals hurl fire for ten thousand miles, flames surging in eight directions. Should any dare to test or resist the perfected of the Supreme, should any dare to oppose the edicts of the Celestial Emperors, the golden axes will execute them at the front, while the colossal axes of the Vast Heaven mete out punishment at the rear. The slaughter of ghostly essences and the destruction of demonic specters who dare to test or resist proceed like wind and fire, never ceasing for even a moment. Wherever the divine might reaches, thousands upon thousands are beheaded, myriads upon myriads have their forms obliterated, leaving no trace behind. Thus, demonic trials dare not trespass, and ghostly spirits are stripped of their spectral manifestations. Scholars who reach this point achieve perfection of merit and completion of the Dao, with inner and outer in perfect unity.\n\nThe Three Officials of the Northern Feng clearly inspect the ghostly camps, permitting no concealment. The Golden Horse relays the message through the Three Officials and Nine Bureaus. The Northern Capital of Luo Feng, which examines the hidden and manifest transgressions, blessings, and misfortunes of the world’s people, clearly inspects the ghostly camps’ records of sins and the black registers of those who are due. If a scholar’s accumulated karmic burden is heavy, and the calamities of their deceased ancestors have not yet been absolved, they shall not be allowed to remain concealed or stagnant, but shall all be purged and removed. The post-horses present their cases, and they ascend to roam in the Supreme Clarity. Universally proclaimed without end, all spirits heed the command, and the message is spread throughout the ten directions and the Three Realms, so that all may know and obey the Heavenly Worthy’s decrees.

      "translated_text": "The Orthodox Unity Lineage, Transmitting the Dao and Harmonizing Non-Action, Illuminating Ancestral Models and Exemplary Perfected, the Forty-Third Celestial Master Zhang Yuchu, Annotator of the *Original Cavern’s Jade Chronicle*:\n\nIn the *Jade Chronicle of the Original Cavern*, the Dragon Han and Yan Kang eras stretch across boundless kalpas, within the primordial chaos.\n\nShaowei says: \"This discusses the kalpic cycles of formation and dissolution, hence the principles of the Dragon Han and Yan Kang eras.\" The *Mysterious Record of Mount Gui* states: \"The *Original Cavern* is the qi of the Supreme Sovereign. The Heavenly Worthy condensed the qi of the *Original Cavern* to compose the *Jade Chronicle*, taking the Dragon Han kalpa as the first kalpa, its inception named *Red Clarity*, and its conclusion *Yan Kang*. The kalpic cycles are endless, ending only to begin anew. After a kalpa’s end, the Three Realms dissolve and all things’ essences and spirits abide in the Great Void—hence *Yan Kang*, the designation for the kalpa of dissolution. *Red Clarity* marks the beginning of the cosmic chart.\"\n\nThe *Scripture of the Nine Grades* says: \"Of old, in the primordial darkness, when the myriad heavens were undivided, the Primordial Beginning first took form, and the five kalpas commenced transformation. Thereupon, the Heavenly Worthy commanded the Venerable Lord of the Dawn Dao to initiate the celestial records, governing the five kalpas. Thus, the *Original Cavern* embodies the qi of formation, while the *Jade Chronicle* records the celestial origins. From the singular qi’s division, the Three Causes coalesced into the Nine, coiling like dragons or serpents through the nine paths, boundless and infinite—all comprising the primordial qi of the Nine Yangs. The Supreme One then harmonized the Brahma qi to inaugurate the ancestral qi of the Azure Heaven. Hence, the East received nine qi to divide the celestial realm, its kalpa named *Dragon Han*; the South received three qi to divide the celestial realm, its kalpa named *Red Clarity*; the Center received twelve qi to divide the celestial realm, its kalpa named *Supreme Sovereign*; the West received seven qi to divide the celestial realm, its kalpa named *Yan Kang*; the North received five qi to divide the celestial realm, its kalpa named *Kai Huang*. Once the five kalpas had run their course, the August Heaven took form. The singular qi merged with the Dao, the Eight Radiant Sceneries streamed with light, the Eight Emperors manifested, and the Nine Empyreans branched forth. The qi of the Five Yangs of the *Original Cavern* congealed into the *Jade Chronicle*, whereupon the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign was commanded to record the *Original Cavern*’s inception, the kalpic cycles’ revolving origins, and the merits of the Heavenly Perfected and Heavenly People in their cultivation of immortality, along with the paths of ascent and retreat.\"\n\nNow, the *Original Cavern* is the ancestral qi of the Great Cavern of the Primordial Beginning. From this ancestral qi, the *Jade Chronicle* was formed. The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign wielded the brush to record the kalpic reckonings, beginning with *Dragon Han* and ending with *Yan Kang*. Through kalpas of immeasurable duration, formation and dissolution alternate—once dispersed, they reunite, returning to the primordial chaos. Countless hundreds of millions of kalpas pass, boundless and unfathomable. Above, no further colors remain; below, no further abysses endure. Wind and marsh pervade the void; adamantine qi rides the heavens. Between heaven above and heaven below, no darkness or obscurity, no form or shadow, no limits or bounds—only the vast Brahma, the expansive and lightless.\n\nMo’an says: \"This cites the affairs of the ancestral *Dragon Han* kalpa to introduce the principle of *Red Clarity*, the second kalpa’s cosmic inception.\" In the *Dragon Han* kalpa, once heaven and earth were dissolved, above and below could no longer be perceived through form or image.\n\nYan Dong says: \"At each kalpa’s end, the Three Luminaries darken, heaven and earth merge into chaos—what colors remain above, what abysses below?\"\n\nXue Youqi says: \"Wind and marsh are the qi of the Dao. Adamantine is the qi of essence. When the Dao’s qi is utterly yielding, it pervades the void; when the essence’s qi is utterly firm, it governs the heavens.\" Xiao Guanfu says: \"Wind is qi without form; marsh is form without substance—this is the principle of spontaneous non-being, the so-called qi of the Dao. *Gold* endures unchanged through past and present; *adamantine* remains unyielding and indestructible—this is the purest, most wondrous essence, the so-called qi of essence. *Obscurity* is the yin realm; *utmost extremity* is the boundary. *Primordial darkness* is the state before heaven and earth divided. Once a kalpa ends, though heaven and earth are vast, all forms and qi are subject to transformation. Thus, above and below can no longer be sought through color or abyss. Only the qi of wind and marsh, empty and void, and the indestructible adamantine qi, which the heavens’ qi rides in its revolutions, endure like the heavens’ ceaseless motion. As the firmness of Qian inwardly revolves, the yin shadows gradually dissipate. Thus, between heaven above and heaven below, the primordial qi merges into oneness—no obscurity, no form or shadow, ceaseless in its revolutions, without end or limit. Vast and boundless, as before heaven and earth divided; swelling and surging, all pervaded by the Brahma qi. *Expansive* lies beyond the Eight Extremities, indescribable—hence, it is said to be without light, its luminosity inwardly concealed yet unmanifest.\"\n\nCultivators regard the body as transient as bubbles, destined for arising and ceasing. They gather the primordial True One’s qi from before their parents’ birth, as when heaven and earth first divided from the primordial darkness, and further receive the Qian metal’s utterly firm qi to form the golden embryo. This is the wondrous existence of the singular spirit, enduring through kalpas. Though kalpas shift and the Three Realms dissolve, all things empty, this nature abides in the wondrous void, independent and unchanging, revolving without cease. Thus, its ceaseless self-strengthening knows no bounds. The Brahma qi inwardly congeals to form the foundation of the elixir, vast and boundless, containing light yet unradiant—this is the initial division of yin and yang, where yin exhausts itself and yang becomes pure.\n\n*Red Clarity* unfolds the cosmic chart, and salvation proceeds spontaneously. The Primordial Beginning presides in tranquility, unfolding the Five Chapters. The *Red Script* in jade characters, the Eight Might’s dragon script, safeguard and regulate the kalpic cycles, ensuring heaven’s enduring existence.\n\nMo’an says: \"The outer four chapters correspond to the former four heavens; the central chapter corresponds to the latter four heavens.\" *Red Clarity* is the name of a kalpa. Qingyuan says: \"At the inception of *Red Clarity*, the great kalpic cycle unfolds the cosmic chart, the *Jade Chronicle* establishes its records, and heaven and earth reopen. Thereupon, heaven and earth, sun and moon, stars and constellations, mountains and rivers, and all phenomena divide at once. Day and night, cold and heat, the four seasons proceed in succession, without error or deviation.\"",

      "translated_text": "Thus it is said: \"The kalpic measures unfold naturally.\" *Primordial Beginning presides in tranquility*—the ancestral qi resumes its brush, stabilizing heaven and anchoring earth. The Five Chapters: from the Primordial Beginning emerges the Brahman qi, shaping form into cloud-seal celestial script, bearing the five wondrous truths of the primordial spirit and the true Dao—hence the Five Chapters.\n\nThe *Red Script* in jade characters: Mo’an says, \"The outer chapters stabilize the outer realms; the *Red Script*, yang’s vermilion manifestation, images the sun. The central chapter stabilizes the center; the *jade characters*, yin’s pale manifestation, images the moon.\" It is also the *Hundun Red Script*—after the cosmic chart’s unfolding, the Red Script is once more proclaimed, carved into jade as script to stabilize and anchor. The Eight Might’s dragon script: Mo’an says, \"The former four heavens and the latter four heavens, together comprising the eight directions, are all dragon script.\" It is also the register of the eight dragons, capable of subduing demons and spirits, commanding ghosts and gods. By its efficacy, it safeguards and regulates the kalpic cycles’ transformations, enduring coeternal with heaven.\n\nThe human body possesses the singular Dao of nature and life. Yet life has its end, while nature knows no decay or ruin. Thus, those who cultivate concentration and wisdom delve deeply into the doctrines of life and death, the principles of the hidden and manifest, until they can fully realize their nature and fulfill their destiny—thereupon, the root of nature remains undying, its stem ever-abiding, directly attaining the wondrous subtleties of the seven returns and nine restorations. Though passing through kalpas uncounted, the wheel of suffering is extinguished—this is long life and enduring vision, transcending the posterior heaven.\n\nThe Brahman darkness of *Mīra* unfolds myriad patterns. The primordial net flows and evolves, spanning the thirty-two heavens. Revolving through the formless, it cycles through the ten directions. The Dipper whirls past the Winnowing Basket, traversing the five constants. Mo’an says: \"This speaks of the second kalpa, when the Red Script is reestablished—the functioning of heaven and earth. With the Red Script’s reestablishment, heaven and earth resume their positions, all things are reborn, and the Brahman qi of the Primordial Beginning’s ancestral kalpa fills and envelops all heavens above. The host of living beings, the ten thousand categories, are thus transformed by a single qi, unfolding and manifesting—thereafter, the myriad things are complete. The Brahman qi flows and spreads, issuing forth as script—this becomes the canonical models, the teachings and admonitions, the scriptural treasuries and written records, serving as patterns without end. Though vast as a hundred thousand myriad threads, all arise from the Brahman qi’s generation.\"\n\nFrom the unfolding of myriad patterns, the net’s principles are established. The *primordial net*—like a net’s master cord. Once the patterns are spread, the net’s principles flow and evolve without cease, thus pervading the thirty-two heavens, revolving even unto the formless realms, cycling through one circuit to reach all ten directions. Beginning and ending in turn, not a single breath of the primordial unity is interrupted—none is left unpervaded.\n\nThe Dipper whirls past the Winnowing Basket: the Dipper is the central Dipper, that is, the heart. The Winnowing Basket pertains to the *gen-yin* position of the east; at each year’s Beginning of Spring, the Dipper’s handle aligns at dusk with the start of *yin*, rotating leftward with heaven, beginning its traverse at the Winnowing Basket, dwelling at the center while sequentially establishing the twelve earthly branches. The five constants are the five planets—not called the five phases and five planets, but the five constants. The Dipper moves at the center, the five phases each fulfilling their functions—this is the constant Dao of heaven and earth. A year’s twelve earthly branches cycle and recommence; the Dipper traverses the Winnowing Basket’s beginning, the sun, moon, and five planets move in retrograde through three hundred sixty-five degrees. When the Dipper’s handle points to earth, the true qi of the prior heaven also follows the Dipper’s inner movement, arising from the ninefold earth to generate the myriad things.\n\nWithin a single day in the human body, there are the seasonal nodes of a year, cycling through the twenty-eight constellations, the twenty-four qi, the seventy-two pentads, and the sixty-four hexagrams to complete the celestial fire’s measures. Measuring by the human body, heaven’s yang arises at *zi*, reaching *yin* as the three yangs, imaging *Tai*, ascending from the lower field. Gradually traversing the Dipper and Winnowing Basket, it circulates through the six voids—all is one’s true unity qi, cycling through the ten directions, following the constant Dao of the five phases. With the heart’s emptiness revolving unceasingly, none fails to be reached by its turning. This is what is meant by \"movement and stillness without origin, yin and yang without beginning.\"\n\nThirty-five divisions, the upper origin’s total qi. The eight luminous scenes merge in darkness, qi enters the profound profundity. Within the profound, the Grand August, the Highest Perfected. Floating upon the luminous rosy clouds, whistling and chanting the cavernous chapters. Mo’an says: \"The *origin* is above the head. The eight scenes are the eight solar terms. The four seasons and four directions each have eight scenes, combining to form the sixty-four hexagrams.\" *Guan Fu* says: \"The thirty-five divisions are the yin-yang, five phases, and twenty-eight constellations.\" Examining the *Du Fen Chi Bu*, it is also called measuring the movements of the sun, moon, and five planets, dividing the degrees of the twenty-eight constellations—hence the thirty-five divisions. When the sun and moon unite as a jade bi and the five planets align as strung pearls, clustering with the twenty-eight constellations, this is called the total qi’s division into thirty-five; in summation, it is one qi.\n\nThe *upper origin* refers to the ancient calendar’s eleventh-month new moon, the winter solstice at midnight, when the sun, moon, and five planets converge at *zi*—this is the upper origin. The eight scenes are the eight luminous scenes within the three sections of the *Scripture of Generating the Spirit*. The *Grand August within the profound* is the Three Treasure Lords within the three qi of the Primordial Profundity—these are the Highest Perfected of the luminous rosy clouds, above the three qi of the Brahman clarity’s scene. The *cavernous chapters* are the golden truths’ radiant luxuriance, whistling and chanting the songs below. Cultivating within, the sun and moon unite as a jade bi—then water and fire achieve harmony.",

The medicine is gathered at the onset of the winter solstice, seizing the nodal qi of an entire year, at the very moment when the first yang stirs—this is the summation of qi’s upper origin. Thus it is said: the origin is the supreme of beginnings.\n\nAs one qi ascends to the mud-pill palace, the qi-timings of the eight nodes all merge in profound harmony. Thereby one enters directly into the midst of the mysterious mystery, where the indistinct and obscure contain essence. And when my primordial spirit and ancestral qi converge at the summit of the Great Abyss, this is the Highest Perfected’s rosy radiance above the three qi.\n\nWhen the great rosy clouds stream forth their hues and the empty void forms sound, whistling and chanting arise in joyous resonance—this is the spontaneous response.

Within the Central Yellow earthen cauldron, purple light and crimson hues gather qi and amass mist, then flourish to congeal the real. Vigorous within and without, the ten thousand qi return to the real, like waters flowing to their source, like wheel-spokes converging at the hub—spirit flows freely, qi harmonizes.\n\nA thousand spirits harmonize into one spirit, ten thousand qi merge into one qi—all is the principle of spontaneity. Internally conjoined to form the real, these are the most wondrous and divine mechanisms of the returned elixir, not achieved through artificial effort. As the scripture says: \"When the revolving wind blends, the work is completed in a hundred days.\" The *Canticle* states: \"Tending and nurturing the *yin-e*, congealing the spirit to form the body.\"\n\nWithin the real there is spirit—the Great Lord of Longevity, the Peerless Duke, the Venerable White Prime, the Great Unity Controller of Destiny, Peach-Kang and Union-Longevity—grasping talismans and holding registers, preserving life and engendering roots. That within the real there is spirit refers to the primordial spirit as the essence of nature, for it is indestructible from kalpas past—this is the Great Lord of Longevity. The \"something within the indistinct\" and the \"essence within the obscure\"—its essence is most real, and within it there is certainty.\n\nThe Peerless is the spirit of the liver; the White Prime, the spirit of the lungs; the Great Unity is the lord of the hundred spirits, the Controller of Destiny, the spirit of the heart; Peach-Kang and Union-Longevity are the spirits of the two kidneys. The Ancient Fool says: Speaking generally of the four spirits means that metal and wood do not obstruct each other, and water and fire do not overcome one another. The five spirits do not mention the spirit of the spleen, for without the central intent, the four images cannot harmonize—thus the spirit resides within it.\n\nTherefore, the Great Unity dwells at the center, emblematizing the five phases. In the elixir way, Kan receives the earth of Wu, and Li receives the earth of Ji—this is called Kan’s Wu as the moon’s essence, Li’s Ji as the sun’s light. The union of water and fire, the fusion of lead and mercury, the merging of metal and wood—all are mediated by the central intent. The work of refinement, the most wondrous and divine mechanisms, do not exceed the principles of the five phases’ sequence and inversion.\n\nIf one can harmonize the sequential circumstances of daily life to investigate the marvels of inversion, the four images conjoin, the five phases gather—then the stem of life grows ever more secure, and the root of nature attains longevity. This is the utmost spirit within the utmost real. Guanfu says: The true spirit preserves its nature and life, the numinous qi guards its root of generation.\n\nTalismans and registers—expressed in terms of form—are the primordial talismanic mandates. Sought within the formless, they are one’s own true qi. If one can grasp and uphold them without negligence, one may secure and strengthen the primordial life, so that the dead soul receives deliverance and revives its root.\n\nAscending to the Upper Clarity, entering and exiting the Flowery Chambers, within the eight obscurities and the subtlest realms. Below, it stabilizes the human body—mud-pill palace and crimson palace—governing the five qi within, blending the hundred spirits. Ten revolutions return the numinous, ten thousand qi unite as immortals.\n\nMo’an says: This describes how scholars refine and attain the real. The *Upper Clarity* is the mud-pill palace. The *Flowery Chambers* are the three realms’ flowery chambers. The *eight obscurities* are the eight poles. The *mud-pill* is the brain’s summit. The *crimson palace* is the heart. The *five qi* are the five phases. The *hundred spirits* are the spirits within the body. This is the verification of refining and attaining the real.\n\nWithin the real, the spirit’s numinous wonders are already complete—thus it ascends and descends, circulating without cease. Above, it courses through the Heavenly Gate and the Upper Clarity’s Flowery Chambers, circling within the eight poles—even in the subtlest and most minute, there is nowhere it does not reach. Below, it stabilizes the human body, returning to the body’s center from the mud-pill palace down to the crimson palace, and back to the mysterious pass of the central palace.\n\nThe *center*—the body’s center—is called grasping the center, guarding the center, compassing the center, encircling the center, the one center, the yellow center—all are one principle. If the true breath settles within and the center is empty while the exterior is bright, then qi naturally regulates itself. The *five qi* are essence, spirit, soul, spirit-soul, and intent. When breath is regulated to the point of no-breath, the heart is pure and the spirit congeals—the five qi govern within, the hundred spirits merge within, circulating and returning without cease. After ten revolutions, the spirit within the real is unfathomably numinous; the body’s ten thousand qi all enter the immortal way.",

      "translated_text": "This marks the response of the ten-month internal elixir, when merit is complete and the Dao perfected. Here lies the subtlety of pursuing the two qi along the Yellow Way, uniting the three natures in the primordial palace, drawing emotions back to nature, and returning to the root to restore life—all accomplished through the ten revolutions of practice.\n\nThe immortal way values life and delivers boundless beings. Above, the eight gates open, and the celestial Dharma-wheel takes flight. Karmic retribution, prohibitions, past-life causes, and conditions—all receive universal deliverance, where dead souls gain living bodies. Once the body attains rebirth, it ascends to be heard by the various heavens. Above the heavens, each has its own gate of life.\n\nMo’an says: This speaks of the karmic retribution of worldly beings, yet all may ultimately receive the grace of deliverance. Such is the immortal way of long life. Thus, the Most High cherishes life without limit, universally delivering the infinite. The eight gates are the portals of the eight-directional Dharma-wheel. The good and evil of worldly karma are all created by the mind, giving rise to the division of heaven and hell. People, drowned in the obscuration of greed and lament, unaware of prohibitions, or bound by past-life and present habits, become entangled and stained—hence the retribution of cyclic rebirth. Now, by the great compassion of the Heavenly Worthy, all receive deliverance: above, the eight directional gates open, the Dharma-wheel turns, and the radiance of wisdom shines swiftly like flying celestials, penetrating the darkest depths. Thus, dead souls are delivered and gain living bodies. Having received rebirth, one must rely on the talismanic decree of the Primordial Beginning to petition the heavens, whereupon the heavens, according to one’s merit and endowment, grant a living body—resulting in ranks of immortals, high and low. Dead souls, following the gate of karmic rebirth, each receive the grace of deliverance.\n\nThe gate of life refers to the \"gate of life and door of death\" spoken of in the *Scripture of Life Spirits*. Above the heavens, each has its own jurisdiction. Within them lies the empty cavern, the verses of chanting songs, the numinous chapters of demon kings, and the words that match the exalted perfected. Mo’an says: This is the preface to the demon kings’ songs, where the Primordial Beginning selects their verses to harmonize with the cavernous chapters of the exalted perfected. The \"empty cavern\" refers to the \"empty cavern within heaven\" mentioned earlier. The \"chanting songs\" are the demon kings’ verses. This preface to the demon kings’ songs of the three realms cites the Primordial Beginning’s words to match the cavernous chapters, hence incorporating them among the exalted perfected—this is called the *Numinous Chapter*.\n\nThe scriptures and methods state: The cavernous chapters are the cinnabar and yellow of Mount Gui, the soaring mysterious purple script—not composed by demon kings. The Most High disseminated these three chapters to the world, enabling people to awaken and transcend the three realms. When the Heavenly Worthy descended to subdue the demons, the demon kings all bowed their heads in submission, and were commanded to govern the three realms, each singing verses that transform and fly through the void, warning celestial and human beings, repelling desire-demons, so that those who hear this flying celestial sound turn from the suffering of sensual desire and return to the gate of purity.\n\nThe preceding text states: \"Above the heavens, each has its own gate of life,\" and continues, \"within them lies the empty cavern and verses of chanting songs\"—thus, within the heavens, there are naturally cavernous chapters. The demon kings’ flying celestial songs, in their meaning of reverence and warning, resonate with the celestial perfected, and are thus worthy to be matched with the exalted perfected.\n\nThe first is the flying celestial sound of the Desire Realm:\n\nMo’an says: The Desire Realm lies at the boundary between celestials and humans; in the human body, it is the realm of heart and kidneys. Transcending the ghost path leads to humanity; entering the immortal way leads to flying through the void. Gu Yu says: The demon king’s name is Yu Mo. The Daoist scriptures state: If one’s oral karma is pure, possessing ten good deeds or more, one is born in the six heavens of the Desire Realm. The *Lingbao Scriptures and Methods* state: From Huangzeng to Moye is the Desire Realm; when the six desires are all purified, one ascends to the Form Realm.\n\nThe human path is faint and distant, the immortal way vast and remote;\nThe ghost path delights in endings, while the human gate is life.\nThe celestial way values life, the ghost way values death.\nThe immortal way is ever auspicious, the ghost way ever inauspicious.\nExalted, pure, and numinous, I chant sorrowfully in the great void.\nI only wish the immortal way to succeed, not the human path to perish.\nThe Northern Capital’s Spring Bend Prefecture holds a myriad ghostly hosts,\nAll seeking to cut short human lifespans and sever the gate of life.\nAh! Sing the cavernous chapters to restrain the Northern Feng,\nBind and dispatch the demonic essences, behead the six ghostly blades.\nThe qi of the various heavens surges boundlessly, my Dao daily flourishes.\n\nMo’an says: This speaks of the Northern Capital’s Spring Bend Prefecture within our bodies—namely, the Northern Feng. The myriad ghostly hosts are the demonic essences and six ghostly blades. If I can restrain, bind, dispatch, and behead them, then the celestial qi daily grows within me, and the immortal way daily manifests within me.\n\n\"Faint and distant\" means subtle and elusive. \"Vast and remote\" means lofty and far-reaching. The \"gate of life\" is the threshold of life and death. \"Numinous spirits\" refers to the ghostly realm. The Spring Bend Prefecture is the northern yin within the body. The \"gate of life\" is the stem of life. The human path is faint and fleeting, subtle and hard to exhaust; the immortal way is lofty, remote, and hard to fathom. Thus, from the moment humans take form, they become attached and bound—eyes to forms, ears to sounds, nose to scents, mouth to tastes—all roots of the three poisons and six desires, leading to the retribution of the three paths and five sufferings. Because people cannot cultivate the immortal way, the ghost path seems joyful, standing at the gate of human life and death, seeking only human annihilation. Thus, the celestial way cherishes life, while ghosts value death.\n\nYet those who pursue the immortal way must cultivate virtue and accumulate goodness, and whatever they summon will be auspicious. Those who sink into the ghost path must harm virtue and goodness, and whatever they seek will be inauspicious. \"Exalted, pure, and numinous\"—the demon king speaks of his dwelling’s vastness, which no numinous spirit can invade. Chanting sorrowfully, flying through the great void, he pities those who drift far from the immortal way.",

      "translated_text": "May scholars only aspire to the fulfillment of the immortal Dao, not the exhaustion of the human way. The Northern Metropolis’ Springs and Bends Prefecture is none other than the Northern Metropolis of Fengdu. The Dark Pass is governed by Mount Tai, where the office oversees the meting of punishments, the tallying of transgressions, and the recording of faults. The Three Realms’ Four Bureaus—mountains, rivers, moats, and altars—on the Three Origins, Eight Festivals, Five La Days, and Three Assemblies, examine and assess merits and demerits with impartiality, down to the finest detail. Those who uphold goodness and cultivate blessings extend their years and lengthen their lives; those who do evil and incur misfortune have their allotted years erased and their lifespans cut short, their records sent to Fengdu’s Springs and Bends. Within Fengdu’s precincts, a multitude of ghosts conspire to intercept and sever human lifespans, cutting off the root of life, unwilling to see the immortal Dao fulfilled.\n\nThe Northern Metropolis of Fengdu within the human body is the River of Love and Sea of Desire. If one cannot restrain desire and nurture the heart-mind, then deluded thoughts scatter like flying dust, all becoming demonic spirits. Ah, let one chant the empty and cavernous verses to subdue and restrain Fengdu’s ghosts, driving them to be bound, sent away, and beheaded, so that the blades of the six demonic ghosts may instantly vanish and fall silent. With inner cultivation and outer conduct accumulated, and myriad virtues perfected day by day, the celestial way’s true radiance will flourish boundlessly, and our Dao shall thus prosper.\n\n**Second: The Chapter of the Form Realm’s Demon King**\n\nMo’an says: The Form Realm is the heaven of the middle heavens; within humans, it is the realm of the heart-mind and eyes. Free from attachment, one can transform, take flight, and ascend. Shaowei says: The Demon King’s name is Mara. The Daoist scriptures state: With three hundred virtuous deeds in bodily conduct, one is born into the Form Realm. From Yuexing Heaven to Tanshi Heaven, there are eighteen heavens in all, comprising the Form Realm. The people of this heaven possess form but no desire; their allotments are subtle and light, the eighteen dusts, and the dusts’ defilements are all purified, ascending to the Formless Realm.\n\nLofty and vast, luminous qi spreads in all four directions. The Brahma-conduct heavens encircle the ten directions. Boundless great spirits all arise from within my body. I possess cavernous verses—ten thousand recitations, and one becomes immortal. The immortal Dao values deliverance; the ghost path clings fast. Heaven and earth stretch boundless, foul qi swirling thickly. Within the Three Realms, joy endures—pass beyond it, and it abides long. Crossing my realm, the body enters spontaneity. At this time, joy is but a trifling grace of mine. The Dragon Han is vast—how can one distinguish the true? My realm is hard to cross, so I compose these cavernous texts. Transforming and flying through the void, I test your body. Success or failure, slackening or retreat—how many will cross? I laugh at those who do not cross, so I sing these songs.\n\n“Lofty” describes the vastness of the celestial body. “Luminous qi” refers to the bright and pure Brahma-qi, spreading in all four directions, flowing through the heavens of the ten directions, pervading all. The “boundless great spirits” are the Demon King’s words on his limitless transformations, all the spirits within his body. The “cavernous verses” are the aforementioned cinnabar-yellow texts of Mount Gui, the soaring mysterious purple script, fully recorded in the *Lingbao* methods—this is not the Demon King’s song. “Ten thousand recitations” means that only after long and sincere accumulation of power will effort reach fruition and immortality be achieved—not merely through frequent recitation.\n\nWhat the immortal Dao values is long life and deliverance from the world. What the ghost path entangles is this: when people cannot cultivate themselves, their bodies perish and their qi disperses; their hun and shen are examined, and their ancestors and forebears are implicated. Heaven and earth are vast and boundless, yet foul and turbid qi swirls and intertwines within them. Within the Three Realms, only those who transcend can abide long and attain supreme joy. “My realm” is the Demon King’s self-reference. Those who cross this realm merge their bodies with spontaneity, all habitual tendencies forgotten, ascending into the formless. At this stage, the six senses are all purified, the eight consciousnesses all empty, utterly serene and unified in truth—its joy is boundless. Though this arises from the fulfillment of power and virtue, it is also through the Demon King’s sponsorship that one becomes immortal. Thus it is said: “a trifling grace of mine.”\n\nThe Dragon Han is the name of the Primordial Beginning’s first kalpa, vast and boundless. At the dawn of the ancestral kalpa, the great simplicity had not yet dispersed, and the true nature of original being was undifferentiated—how could there be distinctions of purity and impurity, refinement and coarseness? Once human desire arose and emotions and perceptions obscured it, the original nature became divided, and karmic consciousness flowed endlessly, until even my realm became hard to cross. Thus I compose these cavernous texts to instruct and encourage, desiring that people realize the Dao and attain truth, crossing this realm.\n\nThe “cavernous texts” are the song-verses. “Transforming and flying through the void,” the Demon King speaks of his unfathomable spiritual transformations, testing the hearts of Dao cultivators: sometimes with what they desire, sometimes with what they fear, sometimes with what they neither desire nor fear. Over days and months, if the heart becomes like iron and stone, unwavering and without slackening, then the Dao’s work is accomplished. Yet how many, despite success or failure, slackening or retreat, are not deterred by demons and ultimately cross the Three Realms? Some falter midway, incurring the Demon King’s laughter—they do not cross. The songs are composed with good intent to encourage. Those who cultivate must accumulate merit and conduct over time, connecting with the numinous. Then inner demons do not arise, outer demons naturally cease, the Dao’s work is accomplished, and one can be delivered from the world.\n\n**Third: The Song of the Formless Realm’s Demon King**\n\nMo’an says: The Formless Realm in heaven is the celestial summit; within humans, it is the Niwan summit. Shaowei says: The Demon King’s name is Shao. The Daoist scriptures state: With six hundred virtuous deeds in the heart-mind, one is born into the Formless Realm’s four heavens. From Haoting Heaven to Xiule’s four heavens, these comprise the Formless Realm. The *Benji Jing* says: Afflictions are knots; learning and conduct are habits. When knots and habits are exhausted, one transcends the rank of the seed people.\n\nEntering the cavernous Dao’s境, one ascends and descends with the qi, untouched by calamity. Above the Three Realms, the vast and distant Great Luo.",

      "translated_text": "Above the rootless Formless, cloud-layers rise in towering peaks.\nOnly the Primordial Beginning dwells in the home of vast kalpas.\nIt governs and orders our realm, receiving its mandate from Mysterious Capital.\nWhoever transgresses our realm enters the Jade Void.\nMy station is the supreme king, rectifying and ruling all demons.\nIn the emptiness, ten thousand transformations arise; impure qi blooms in profusion.\nThose who preserve the true are few; those who stray and delude are many.\nThe immortal Dao is hard to secure; the ghostly path easily turns to deviance.\nThe human path lies in the heart-mind—truly, it does not depend on others.\nThe immortal Dao values substance; the human path values splendor.\nIf you do not delight in the immortal Dao, how can you pass beyond the Three Realms?\nShould you wish to revolve through the Five Paths, what then can I do for you?\n\nMo’an says: The vast and distant Great Luo refers to the summit of the thirty-two heavens. Heaven is governed by the Northern Culmen, which orders all heavens. The rootless Formless refers to the summit of the three hundred sixty bones and joints. In humans, the Hundred Meetings governs the entire body. Guanfu says: Above the Three Realms lies the Four Heavens of the Seed People, which is the Great Luo Heaven. Above the Great Luo Heaven stands the Jade Capital Mountain, veiled by layered clouds. Since the beginning of vast kalpas, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy has dwelt within, governing the Three Realms and ruling the Mysterious Capital’s Great Luo Jade Clarity. Our realm is the Formless Realm. The Jade Void is the Void’s Jade Capital. Those who cultivate and refine, attaining deliverance from the Formless Realm and entering the Four Heavens of the Seed People, then enter the realm of the Jade Void. My station is the supreme king—the Demon King declares his merit and rank stand above all other demon kings, thus all demons are rectified and ruled by him. Gazing down upon the emptiness, the dusts of form and the filth of karma arise and vanish in ten thousand transformations; impure and turbid qi intertwine in profusion. Thus, those who can preserve and secure their original true nature are few, while those who become deluded and confused are many. The immortal Dao cannot be firmly established, and one easily falls into the deviance of the ghostly path. The human path: when the heart-mind gathers it, the ten thousand differences return to one root; when it scatters, one root becomes ten thousand differences. Each thing possesses its own Supreme Ultimate—none but this heart-mind. The human heart, the Dao-heart, preserving the heart, nurturing the heart, rectifying the heart, cultivating the heart, observing the heart, settling the heart, illuminating the heart—all Three Teachings share this single heart-method. How could there be another? The immortal Dao values substance: sincerity without falsehood. The human path delights in competitive splendor. If one does not delight in the immortal Dao and aspire to self-cultivation, how can one pass beyond the Three Realms? Thus, one must revolve through the suffering wheel of the Five Paths—what then can I do? This is the Demon King’s earnest admonition. The Five Paths are: gods, humans, birds and beasts, hungry ghosts, and hells.\n\nThis realm above the Three Realms, in the flying emptiness, is where the Demon King’s song resounds, its tones interwoven with cavernous chapters. Reciting it a hundred times delivers one to the Southern Palace. Reciting it a thousand times, the Demon King protects and welcomes. After ten thousand recitations, the Dao is complete—one soars into the great emptiness, passes beyond the Three Realms, and ascends to the rank of Immortal Duke. This is the general praise for the preceding song.\n\nThe Demon King, in the realm above the Three Realms, flies through the great emptiness, composing his song. It can be interwoven with the subtle wonders of cavernous chapters, guiding cultivators to daily progress on the Way. From the Realm of Desire through the Realm of Form to the Formless Realm, reciting and chanting its tones—first a hundred, then a thousand, then ten thousand times—there is no fear of slackening or retreat, only the aspiration that each thought returns to the true. Thus, the difficulty of attaining the embodied Dao can only be overcome by those with resolute will and steadfast conduct. Only after ten thousand recitations, when the Dao is complete, can one soar into the great emptiness, pass beyond the Three Realms, and attain the rank of Immortal Duke. The Immortal Duke is the highest rank of the Supreme Ultimate’s immortal grades. Moreover, ten thousand recitations are not merely oral recitation—they require the power of deep accumulation and thick cultivation through inner work and outer conduct, only then can one ascend into the great emptiness and attain the immortal ranks. Thus, the Heavenly Worthy included it in the orthodox scriptures, praising it: \"This numinous chapter and numinous tone—its power of summoning is truly of the utmost weight.\" Therefore, its words interweave with those of the lofty perfected, its tones with cavernous chapters.\n\nThose who hear the numinous tone, the Demon King respects their form. He commands earth spirits to attend and protect, escorting them in departure and return. They are plucked from the earthly gate, freed from the five sufferings and eight hardships. Seven generations of ancestors ascend and migrate, forever departing the ghostly officials. The soul crosses the Vermilion Mound, undergoes refinement, and is reborn. This is called boundless deliverance, universally liberating without end. There are secret celestial texts, revered by all heavens. Those who leak and slight them fall into hell, bringing calamity upon seven generations of ancestors.\n\nMo’an says: This speaks of the universal deliverance of the demonic chapters and the retribution for scholars who leak and slight. The Primordial Beginning’s scriptural teachings end here. The \"numinous tone\" praises the weight of the Demon King’s song. Those who hear this tone and cultivate without negligence—the Demon King reveres their form and spirit. Thus, Guanfu says: Hearing is not merely ear-hearing; it requires the heart to commune with the scripture and conduct to align with the scripture. Thoughts must never be forgotten, always maintaining reverence and awe. Externally, one dispels all conditions; internally, one cultivates the power of concentration. Over time, with deep merit and complete conduct, the Celestial Thearch commands the spirits of earthly sacrifices to attend and protect one’s dwelling, escorting departures and returns. Even if the Dao is not yet complete and one cannot pass beyond the Three Realms or attain the rank of Immortal Duke, one is still plucked from the earthly gate, freed from the gate of death. No longer subject to the hardships of the five sufferings and eight difficulties, one’s merit extends upward to seven generations of ancestors, all ascending and migrating, forever departing the dark passes and no longer subject to the governance of ghostly officials. The soul directly crosses the Vermilion Mound’s Fire Bureau and is reborn in the realm of bliss. Thus, both life and death receive its boundless merit and endless deliverance. At this stage of inner work, the sacred embryo is complete—one sheds the body, spirit transforms, yin is exhausted, and yang is pure. One directly transcends above the Three Realms, and seven generations of ancestors ascend together.\n\nAlthough the effects of scriptural merit are thus manifest, if this secret is revered by all heavens above, those who commit the transgression of leaking and slighting will not only fall into hell themselves but will also bring calamity upon seven generations of ancestors. One cannot but be warned and cautious.",

When knots and habits are exhausted, one transcends the rank of the seed people.\n\nEntering the cavernous Dao’s境, one ascends and descends with the qi, untouched by calamity. Above the Three Realms, the vast and distant Great Luo.",

      "translated_text": "The Dao speaks: These two chapters are the hidden tones of the Celestial Theads and the Most Numinous Demon Kings—all utterances of the Great Brahma, not common words of the mundane world. Their speech lacks ornate rhythm, their melodies lack florid grace; thus are they called profound and obscure, difficult to fathom in detail. Treasured by the heavens, they are kept secret in the Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace of the Dark Capital. According to the Mystic Statutes, they are transmitted but once in forty thousand kalpas. Should a perfected one bring gold and treasures with a sincere heart, following the ancient protocols to pledge oaths before the Ten Heavens, only then may they be conferred.\n\nMaster Silent Hermitage says: From this point to the five sections of the \"Utmost Clarity’s Perfect Words,\" these are the Dao Lord’s further exposition on the wondrous functions of the scripture—indeed, the postface to the main text. These two chapters of the *Lingbao* postface refer specifically to the preceding first chapter, \"The Primordial Beginning’s Cavernous Mystery *Lingbao* Original Chapter,\" and the following second chapter, \"The Chapter of Empty Cavern’s Songs and Chants.\" Treasured by the heavens, this is the Dao Lord’s further exposition on the scripture’s profound wonders, reflecting the celestial reverence for them.\n\nMaster Observing Return says: These two chapters are the *Hundun Crimson Writ* and the *Primordial Cavern Jade Chronicle*. One elucidates the Dao of the Prior Heaven, the other the Dao of the Posterior Heaven. The *Hundun Crimson Writ* records the names and taboo titles of the Celestial Thearchs and the five celestial designations, its text centered on transcending the arts of the Mystic Ancestors, receiving deliverance in the body of life, unfolding universal salvation, and the purport of traversing passes to proclaim destiny. The *Primordial Cavern Jade Chronicle* speaks of the success and failure of kalpic cycles, the opening of the primordial chaos, the circulation of the primordial qi, the extraction and refinement of cultivation, the return to the root and restoration of destiny, and the Dao of transcending the ordinary to enter sagehood. Thus are they called hidden tones and utterances of the Great Brahma, beyond the reach of common speech. \"Speech lacks ornate rhythm\" refers to the purity and subtlety of the Heavenly Worthy’s scriptural essence; \"melodies lack florid grace\" refers to the clarity and simplicity of the Demon Kings’ songs. Yet their meaning is profound and recondite, scholars unable to exhaust its intricacies. As for the words of Patriarch Silent Hermitage, from the *Lingbao* Original Chapter to the Chapter of Songs and Chants, these are the two chapters—though their text and meaning are one, the *Crimson Writ* and *Jade Chronicle* are contained therein. All are hidden utterances of the Great Brahma, thus treasured by the heavens in the Dark Capital’s Purple Tenuity Palace, transmitted only after countless kalpas in accordance with the Mystic Statutes and prohibitions. How dare one lightly divulge or recklessly transmit them? Those aspirants who seek to receive the scripture must bring gold with a sincere heart, following the celestial perfected ones’ protocols to pledge oaths before the Heavenly Worthy’s sagely host before transmission may be granted. How could one treat them with carelessness, regarding them as common speech? These are all the Dao Lord’s most earnest and solemn instructions.\n\nThe Dao speaks: The revolutions of heaven and earth, too, have their ends of adversity; the sun, moon, and five planets, too, have their waxings and wanings; even the utmost sagely and divine beings have their flourishings and declines; and the lesser learners, too, have their illnesses and afflictions.",

      "translated_text": "Whenever such calamities arise, those of shared qi must unite in heart to perform purification rites, burn incense in the six periods, and recite the scripture ten times through. Thereupon, virtue and power descend at once, dissolving all inauspiciousness. These boundless texts universally deliver limitless beings.\n\nHeaven and earth are the root of the myriad things, yet ultimately confined by form and qi; their revolutions, too, have their adversities and prosperities. Thus, when encountering the tribulations of the Nine Yangs and Hundred Sixes, the Three Realms perish, only to be reconstituted thereafter. The celestial courses of the sun, moon, and five planets, too, have their eclipses and fluctuations; even the utmost sagely and divine beings have their passages and blockages, flourishings and declines—how much more the lesser learners, could they be free of illness and affliction? Therefore, when suffering the bitterness of illness and adversity, one must willingly accept and not complain, thereby aligning with Heaven.\n\nYet humans, heaven and earth, and the myriad things are all of a single qi—this is called \"one root, ten thousand differences.\" The former scholars spoke of Qian as father and Kun as mother, of the people as our siblings and things as our single body—this is what they meant. Thus, whenever such calamities arise, those of shared qi must unite in heart to perform purification rites, burn incense in the six periods, and recite the scripture ten times through. Whether to dissolve celestial disasters above or deliver the multitudes below, to ward off adversity and sustain the declining, there is no prayer that goes unanswered. Thus, virtue and power descend at once, dissolving all inauspiciousness—all through the efficacy of the tenfold recitation. Truly, these are boundless texts that universally deliver heaven and humanity without end.\n\nThe Dao speaks: The lesser learners, their Dao shallow and immortal rank unfulfilled, when their destined time of extinction arrives, their bodies pass through the Great Yin. At the hour of their passing, fellow learners and perfected ones perform incense offerings and recite the scripture ten times to deliver their corporeal forms. By this method, the hun-souls ascend directly to the Southern Palace, where, according to their accumulated merit, they are reborn after a reckoning of days. Their wheel of rebirth unbroken, they thereby attain divine transcendence.\n\nThis is spoken especially for the lesser learners of shallow Dao, whose immortal rank remains unfulfilled. When their destined time of extinction arrives, their cultivation of the immortal Dao incomplete and their bodies not yet purely yang, they must pass through the trials of the Great Yin. The Great Yin is akin to the Northern Yin Springs’ winding depths. At the hour of their passing—when their allotted time nears its end—fellow learners and perfected ones, those of the same teacher or Dao who have attained realization, must perform incense offerings and recite the scripture ten times through to deliver their corporeal forms. By this method, they borrow the perfected ones’ refined yang to recite the scripture, thereby delivering the extreme yin of the corpse and sending the hun-souls to ascend and be reborn in the Southern Palace. The *shi* (corpse) is the untransformed *po*; the *xing* (form) is the untransformed qi. Only through the merit of the scripture and the power of the Dao, refining the substance and molding the hun, can they ascend directly to the Southern Palace. According to their accumulated merit, they are reborn after a reckoning of days, each receiving rebirth in accordance with their learning’s depth and their virtue’s height. Their wheel of rebirth unable to extinguish their fundamental nature, their single spirit undimmed, over time, through the accumulation of profound practice, they, too, attain the immortal Dao.\n\nThe Dao speaks: When the revolutions of heaven and earth reach their end, one must perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite the scripture. When the stellar lodges deviate from their courses and the sun and moon lose their proper times, one must perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite the scripture. When the four seasons lose their order and yin and yang fall out of harmony, one must perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite the scripture. When the sovereign faces calamity and warfare arises on all sides, one must perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite the scripture. When pestilential toxins spread and the multitudes perish, one must perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite the scripture. When teachers and friends pass away, one must perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite the scripture.\n\nPurification rites and scripture recitation carry immense merit. Above, they dissolve celestial disasters and secure the emperor’s reign; below, they dispel toxins and deliver the multitudes. In life and death, all rely upon them—such blessings are beyond measure. Thus, they are called boundless, universally delivering heaven and humanity.\n\nQingyuan said: In this chapter, the Dao Lord clarifies that this scripture not only delivers oneself but also universally aids heaven and earth, sovereigns and ministers, the people and all things—only then is the Dao complete, manifesting the universal deliverance of beings. When the revolutions of heaven and earth reach their end, according to the Supreme Ultimate’s Yuan-Hui-Yun-Shi reckoning, even heaven and earth have their formations and dissolutions, cycles they cannot escape. As the *Book of Changes* says, \"When heaven and earth perish, there is nothing by which to observe their transformations.\" The human body and the workings of creation share the same path, thus one may align with heaven and earth, assist in transformation and nurturance, regulate the Dao, and harmonize its principles. The former scholars did not speak of the unity of heaven and humanity’s governance as merely the oneness of heart and principle. That which governs is called the Emperor; its wondrous functioning is called ghosts and spirits—are they not one and the same? Thus, when the revolutions face adversity and decline, one must perform purification rites and recite the scripture to dispel them.\n\nWhen the stellar lodges deviate from their courses, their celestial positions errant and their shadow-measures awry; when the sun and moon lose their proper times, their waxings and wanings eclipsed—these, too, are confined by the numbers of delay, concealment, and retrogression. One must perform purification rites and recite the scripture to dispel them. When the four seasons lose their order, cold and heat irregular; when yin and yang fall out of harmony, droughts and floods wreak havoc—these, too, arise from deviations in heaven and earth’s supreme harmony. One must perform purification rites and recite the scripture to dispel them. When the sovereign faces calamity and warfare arises on all sides, all such disasters and conflicts stem from yin and yang’s rebellion and governance’s discord. Cultivating virtuous rule, reducing punishments, comforting the people, managing the military, appointing the worthy, and stabilizing the altars of soil and grain—these are the means to dissolve celestial portents and quell human suffering. This is the foremost duty of sagely rulers and worthy ministers. Yet if such calamities arise, one must also perform purification rites and recite the scripture to dispel and restrain them, thereby petitioning Heaven, which will surely quell disasters and send down auspiciousness.\n\nWhen pestilential toxins spread and the multitudes perish, the *qi* of epidemic pestilence poisons the people, inevitably causing death and injury. One must perform purification rites and recite the scripture to dispel and release them, rectifying the *qi*’s conditions so that the pestilential *qi* subsides.",

      "translated_text": "When masters and friends pass beyond, for masters transmit the Dao and impart learning, while friends assist in cultivating benevolence and enhancing virtue—these are among the cardinal principles of human relations. At the time of their passing, one must also perform purification rites and recite the scripture to deliver and ferry them across. Having spoken of masters and friends, one may infer the same for parents and kin.\n\nNow, purification rites and scripture recitation carry profound merit and virtue; herein the Dao Lord extols the merits of this scripture. Internally, they empty the heart to refine *qi*, align with the spirits, and preserve authenticity; externally, their merit can ascend to dissolve celestial disasters, safeguard and stabilize the emperor, descend to dispel toxins and harm, and deliver the multitudes. This may be said to extend its blessings to ruler and minister, people and all beings without exception—its merit is boundless, universally ferrying heaven and humanity alike.\n\nThe Dao states: Whoever possesses this scripture and performs these meritorious deeds for Heaven and Earth, the divine sovereigns, and the multitudes—on days of disaster, if one arouses the mind to perform purification rites, burns incense, and recites the scripture ten times—all the heavens will record their name, myriad spirits will attend and guard them, and those of superior attainment will swiftly become ministers of the Golden Portals of the sagely ruler. The heavens record one’s merits and transgressions with unfailing precision, down to the finest detail. The demon kings of heaven will also protect and recommend them, and those who attain the Dao will thereby fully comprehend the most profound teachings.\n\nMo’an says: Here the Dao Lord once more expounds the efficacy of scholars’ recitation and practice. This passage further summarizes the preceding sections—all are the earnest instructions left by the Dao Lord. Whenever disaster arises, if one burns incense and recites the scripture to perform these meritorious deeds for Heaven and Earth, sun and moon, divine sovereigns, and the multitudes, then the heavens will inscribe their name in the registers of immortals, myriad spirits will attend and guard them on all sides—all achieved through the accumulation of scriptural merit. Those of superior attainment, whose learning has reached its apex, may in an instant ascend to the ranks of immortals, serve the Three Realms as ministers, and spiritually wander the Golden Portals.\n\nThe heavens record one’s merits and transgressions with unfailing precision, down to the finest detail, while the demon kings of heaven also protect and recommend them—this repetition serves as the utmost admonition, urging practitioners to diligence in their efforts. Each heaven has its own bureaus of inspection and record-keeping; merits and transgressions, no matter how minute, are recorded without the slightest omission. Merits lead to ascension in the ranks of immortals, while transgressions are consigned to the ledgers of sin—there is no partiality or error. Those who cultivate in accordance with the scripture’s merit will have the demon kings of heaven protect and recommend them, inscribing their names in the heavens.\n\nThose who attain the Dao do so through the scripture, thereby fully comprehending the most authentic and profound teachings, plumbing the depths of the most mysterious Dao. Inwardly seeking it, this is the way of the spirit dwelling in the Mud Pill Palace, the path of nurturing and refinement.\n\n*The Comprehensive Meaning of the Supreme and Wondrous Scripture of Primordial Beginning’s Limitless Salvation of Humanity, Scroll the Third* (concluded)\n\n*The Comprehensive Meaning of the Supreme and Wondrous Scripture of Primordial Beginning’s Limitless Salvation of Humanity, Scroll the Fourth*",

      "translated_text": "**Annotations by Zhang Yu Chu, the Forty-Third Celestial Master of the Orthodox Unity Lineage, Inheritor of the Dao, Expounder of Non-Action, Illustrious Ancestor, and Perfected Radiant Model, Overseer of Daoist Affairs**\n\n**The Immeasurable Sounds of the Great Brahma Hidden Language in the Heavens**   *Composed by the Dao Lord*\n\nMò’ān observes: This is the preface to the central chapter of the *Numinous Writ*, transmitted from the Jade Dawn Dao Lord’s composition.\n\n“The Heavens” refers to the midst of the Four Outer Heavens. According to the *Inner Pointer Scripture*: The Primordial Celestial Worthy, seated in the Cypress Mound Pavilion of the Crimson Clarity World, was enveloped in swirling mists for seven days and nights, the dark yin unyielding. The Five Elders addressed the Celestial Worthy, saying: “Today, as we attend your seat, we witness what has never been seen before.” When the Celestial Worthy expounded the teachings, rivers and seas fell silent, mountains and peaks concealed their clouds. Yet now, in broad daylight, the sky darkens, and heavenly beings tremble in fear—what is the cause? The Celestial Worthy replied: “Today, the Heavens emit auspicious signs, numinous responses arising naturally. Jade characters blaze with radiance, veiling the light of heaven. Let all present close their eyes.” In an instant, the celestial qi surged forth, the gloom dissolved, and five-colored light illumined the ten directions. Suddenly, a *Numinous Writ* appeared in the void above, each character a *zhang* in size, its resplendent script and eight-cornered rays dazzling the eye, impossible to behold directly. The Celestial Worthy proclaimed to all: “This *Numinous Writ* of the Eight Assemblies bears characters without fixed form, its purport profound and abstruse, difficult to fathom. Let it be annotated.” Thereupon, the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign received the Celestial Worthy’s mandate to explicate its meaning and transmit it to the Dao Lord, that those in the Heavens destined for perfection—those with immortal names—might be instructed.\n\nGuānfù observes: The *Great Brahma* refers to the qi of the Primordial Great Brahma, whose convergence and divergence produce the sounds of Brahma. *Hidden language* denotes the secrets concealed within the Heavens, incomprehensible to mortals. *Immeasurable sounds* signify that beings of all realms and kinds may hear its wondrous meaning without limit. Comprising two hundred and sixty-five characters, they are distributed across the Thirty-Two Heavens, eight characters to each. Inscribed upon the palaces and towers of the Mysterious Capital’s celestial bureaus, they align with each practitioner’s cultivation, allowing their qi to return to its proper abode. Thus, the sounds of the Great Brahma pervade the immeasurable yet remain hidden within the Heavens, untransmittable without the brush of the Perfected Sovereign. Some append the upper and lower chapters of the *Numinous Writ*, along with the Dragon Seal’s orthodox text—materials rejected by Lei Xiao—hence their omission here.\n\n**The Central Chapter of the Primordial Numinous Writ**\nMò’ān observes: The *Numinous Writ* is the *Jade-Character Scripture of the Immeasurable Sounds of the Great Brahma Hidden Language*. The *central chapter* is the chapter of the Center. *Primordial* denotes that it was spoken by the Primordial Celestial Worthy, annotated by the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign, and transmitted to the Dao Lord. The *central chapter of the Numinous Writ* is thus the central chapter of the *Great Brahma Hidden Language*.\n\nGuānfù observes: The Former Perfected declared that this *Numinous Writ* corresponds to the sixty-four hexagrams of the *Great Change*. This scripture predates Heaven and Earth, existing before the hexagrams. The Queen Mother of the West said: “Nine suns guide Qian and Kun; the Mother covers the two hexagrams in the East.” Thus, Qian and Kun originate here, followed by *Tun* and *Meng*, culminating in *Jiji* and *Weiji*, forming the warp and woof of creation. Below, the sixty *jiazi* cycles are arrayed, clarifying the qi’s numerical beginning and end. Next, the twelve hexagrams of the monthly nodes and seasonal markers illustrate the yearly alternation of yin and yang, the progression of cold and heat. Further distinctions of waxing and waning moons elucidate a single month. Twelve double-hours are then marked to regulate the daily advance and retreat of the fire-phase and water-tally. For the yearly seasonal markers are compressed into a month, two and a half days equating to one month, and the twelve hexagrams corresponding to the twelve double-hours, collapsing a month into a single day. Each double-hour equates to two and a half days, hence the upper and lower hexagrams differ in application. The *jiazi* cycles and seasonal markers thus serve distinct purposes. In sum, the upper hexagrams pertain to the *jiazi* scripture, while the lower hexagrams govern seasonal markers and temporal reckoning. By inwardly observing the mind’s movement and stillness, ebb and flow, one naturally grasps the intent and words, and the subtlest principles are fully contained herein. Thus, the meaning of this chapter aligns effortlessly with the wonders of the *Great Change*. The Primordial One expounded this scripture before Fu Xi drew the hexagrams—how could it rely on the *Change* to elucidate the Great Brahma’s text? The principle is one and the same; hence, they coincide like tallying tokens, requiring no forced alignment. By this reasoning, from the Queen Mother of the West onward, masters such as Mò’ān and Shǎowēi have all expounded on the *Change*’s imagery. Yet in Guānfù’s view, their interpretations remain superficial. Here, a comprehensive diagram is appended, harmonizing with Shào’s *Prior Heaven*, Wèi’s *Triplex Unity*, and Péng’s *Heart Mirror*. In its mechanism of advancing yang fire and retreating yin tally, it approaches perfection.\n\n**The Eight Heavens of the East**\n*Dǎnlóu āxī, wúhé guān yīn guàn yīn.*\nEight characters, the inner sounds of the Yellow-Canopy Heaven.\n*Dǎn*: Vast and boundless in appearance.\n*Lóu*: The name of the long tower beneath the Jade Capital Mountain, supporting the Mysterious Capital’s bureaus.\n*Ā*: The Ānà spirit of the Mysterious Capital, overseer of the tower, steward of the Great Brahma’s qi. When the qi’s cycles complete, Ānà strikes the tower’s drum to assemble the Perfected, who ascend to pay homage to the Primordial One.\n*Cāng*: The name of the Imperial Lord’s terrace, verdant and luxuriant.\n*Wú*: The Great Vacuity. Within the Great Nothingness, true sages naturally arise.\n*Hé*: The name of the gate of sun and moon. In the Heavens, sun and moon converge at this gate.\n*Guān*: Perception. This is the Heavenly Emperor’s taboo name.\n*Yīn*: The sound of the eight characters. Those who recite them will have Perfected Ones ride golden wheels to dispel darkness, Jade Maidens unfurl flowered banners and brandish swords, the Perceiver of Awakening preside over the ledgers of eternal night, the Four Perfected relieve the suffering of the Nine Dark Realms, the seven ancestors emerge into brightness, and withered bones revive.",

The Four refers to the palaces of the Four Poles: East Florescence, South Ultimate, West Numinous, and North Perfected. The Perfected of the Four Poles govern the registers of life and death. *Xiàng* is the chariot of the Wheel of Symbols. The Perfected constantly ride these chariots, traversing the Three Realms to audit the records of beings’ lives and deaths, and to initiate and deliver learners.\n\n*Xū* is the curved nurturing. The Heavenly Emperor’s taboo-name is the Southern Palace’s Lord of Life-Measurement, who oversees the refinement and deliverance of decayed souls. *Yuán* is the Emperor. He is the Youth Born at Midday, who pours essence upon the Heavenly People. Those who recite and chant the cavernous chapters will have their jade names inscribed in the Emperor’s register, their lives and deaths delivered at the Southern Palace, and the Four Poles will grant them natural feathered chariots, while their seven ancestors rejoice in ascending to the Hall of Blessings.\n\n**Southern Eight Heavens**\n*South Flaming* – *Yīnyàn* – *Cavern Floating* – *Jade Eyes Shimmering*\nThese eight characters are the inner sound of the Harmonious Yang Heaven.\n\n*South Flaming*: In the south lies the Courtyard of Flowing Fire, its flying flames illuminating the eight directions. *Cavern Floating*: The Palace of Cavernous Yang, where the *qi* of flowing fire blazes and floats upward. *Jade Eyes*: The fat of flowing fire, which refines the body, generates jade radiance, and shines like pupils—hence called Jade Eyes. The Perfected of the South Ultimate preside within this palace. All learners who first attain the Dao proceed to the Courtyard of Flowing Fire, where the Perfected wash and refine them with the fire’s fat, scouring away the dust and filth.\n\n*Shimmering*: Multitudinous. *Dharma-forms fall into emptiness, the Nine Numinous advance forward.*\nThese eight characters are the inner sound of the Reverent Florescence Heaven.\n\n*Dharma-forms*: The title of the Primordial Heavenly Honored One during the Dragon Han kalpa. In the Red Clarity kalpa, he was called the Lord of Primordial Name; at the dawn of the Highest Sovereign’s reign, he was named the Primordial Venerable. His Dharma-body, transformed by the *qi* of Brahma, arises with the kalpas, manifesting as a single spirit without undergoing womb-birth. *Fall into emptiness*: The Primordial One arises from the void. *Nine Numinous*: The Nine Florescence Perfected, who govern the Upper Palace of South Prosperity and oversee the karmic confrontations of souls in the Nine Glooms. *Advance forward*: The Perfected, who manage the records of destiny, assess the merits of souls from past lives.\n\n*Guān Fù* says: When the first *yin* arises, it is like cinnabar yielding mercury; true *yin* descends, resembling the moon’s image. Returning to the Central Palace, *yin* retreats to the Yang Chamber, and mercury hastens to merge with lead.\n\n*Dù* and *Wū* are the Terrace of the Universal, *Green Net of the Great Thousand.*\nThese eight characters are the inner sound of the Ancestral Whirlwind Heaven.\n\n*Dù*: A mountain name in Heaven, atop which lie the dens of myriad dragons and the Yellow Chambers. *Wū*: The inner sound of the Perfected of the True Dawn, who governs the Yellow Chambers, enduring the great kalpas without end and growing ever brighter through the Dragon Han. *Pú*: The hidden title of the Flying Heavenly Perfected, who number beyond count. *Terrace*: The Jade Terrace, situated on the southern side of Marsh Mountain. *Green Net*: Lady Luóyīng of the Moon, who administers the measures of the Great Yin, rides the *qi* of Brahma-conduct, and operates the Pass of Transformation in accord with the Heavenly Origin, without error. When the great kalpas converge, the sun and moon both assemble above the Jade Hall, awaiting the kalpa’s reopening to resume their transformations. *Great Thousand*: The reckoning of worlds. A thousand counted to a thousand is the Lesser Thousand; a thousand Lesser Thousands make a Middle Thousand; a thousand Middle Thousands make a Great Thousand. Those who recite and chant the cavernous chapters will ascend to the Yellow Chambers, wander within the Jade Terrace, and behold the realms of the Great Thousand.\n\n*Vast and Nine Ugly, Sháo’s Songs and Yuán’s Circuit.*\nThese eight characters are the inner sound of the August Reed Heaven.\n\n*Vast*: In the era of Extended Purity, the jade characters of Heavenly script were veiled and indistinct, faint and remote. *Vast*: When the Dragon Han kalpa began, its texts became bright again, vast and boundless. Upon encountering the true Dao, when the destiny of men and women reaches its limit and another kalpa passes, the nine *qi* each generate a beast to harm the wicked. Once the kalpa reopens, these nine beasts are called the Nine Ugly Ghosts. The Northern Emperor and the Upper Perfected govern the registers of life and death, thus establishing the Nine Ugly to assist the Three Officials. Their number culminates in eighty-one myriad, measuring the convergence of Heavenly *qi*. The Nine Ugly are titled the Nine Capital Envoys.\n\n*Sháo*: The inner name of the Divine Sovereign of the August Reed Heaven. The Divine Sovereign of the Divine Empyrean is the spirit of the Demon King, who constantly tests learners of the Dao, discerning correctness from error. He composes songs to disturb the heart. Those whose hearts remain steadfast are then protected and promoted to ascend the August Reed Heaven. *Yuán* is another name for the Southern Dipper. *Zhān* is an alternate title for the Northern Dipper. Those with meritorious deeds are recorded by the Southern Dipper, which then delivers them from the trials of the Three Realms, rescues them from the sufferings of the Nine Glooms, and reports to the Demon King, who dares not harm or obstruct them. Those with evil deeds are recorded by the Three Officials and reported to the Northern Dipper, which then instructs the Demon King to annihilate their souls, consigning them to the depths of the Nine Glooms to toil through endless nights, never to emerge.\n\n*Above the Clouds, Nine Capitals—Flying Life Soars Freely.*\nThese eight characters are the inner sound of the Hall Radiance Heaven.\n\n*Above the Clouds*: The inner taboo-name of the Flying Heavenly Divine King. At the opening of the Dragon Han kalpa and the commencement of the Red Clarity kalpa, he unfolded the books of spontaneity and established the roots of Heaven and Earth. *Nine Capitals*: After the Three Symbols divided, there arose a nine-tiered terrace situated above the Jade Capital, resplendent amidst the Empty Mystery. The Flying Heavenly Divine People constantly scatter the incense of a hundred harmonies and the flowers of the five clouds to observe the Flying Heavenly Perfected. Upon the terrace stands the Grand Perfected Jade Youth, who thrice daily holds the banner of ten absolutes, circling once to summon the Heavenly Emperors of all heavens to thrice encircle the Mystic Terrace. Learners who constantly recite the cavernous chapters will have their flying lives open the path of deathlessness, where the *qi* of eternal life flows downward to refine the five souls, and the Eight Sceneries are preserved. *Soars Freely*: The Forest of Soaring. Learners who ascend the Mystic Terrace and wander the Forest of Soaring, their bodies adorned with Heavenly script and their mouths chanting the cavernous chapters, will eventually ascend to the Palace of the Empty Capital.",

Once the nine degrees were clarified, the nine positions were arrayed, and the ten thousand kinds of yin and yang were born, naturally discerning and distinguishing. *A* is the inner name of the *A Qiu* Heavenly King, who constantly rides a dragon chariot to ascend the ridge of Dragon Mountain, roaming and observing within the Nine Mysteries. *Na* is the hidden name of the *Na Xie* *Feitian* divine person, who flies through the Three Realms, reviewing the long night and delivering the souls of the good. Those who know the sound of the eight characters will have the Heavenly King assess and deliver their bodies, entering the foremost ranks of the flying transcendent hosts, transforming their decayed bones into the countenance of youths.\n\n*Wu Liang Fu Gai*, *Fu Luo He Shen*. The eight characters are the inner sound of the *Ruan Le* Heaven. *Wu Liang* is the first divine being among the boundless great deities of heaven, who governs all the flying transcendent deities, for all receive their assessment from him and thereby ascend and advance. *Fu* is the inner name of the *Gengsheng* Perfected, who constantly reviews the records of the dark night and examines the roots of good and evil. *Gai* is the title of the *Xuan Zhong* Hall of Blessings. *Fu* refers to the souls of the dark night, who receive deliverance from the Perfected and are thus called *floating*. *Luo* is the *Great Luo*, who opens the great thousand worlds, summoning the guests of rebirth to ascend to the *Great Luo* Heaven and determine their registers, erasing death. *He* is *He Qing* (Joined Celebration). *Shen* is the *Divine Duke*, the minister of the *Great Luo*. Those who know the sound of the eight characters will join in celebration with the Divine Duke and receive deliverance as guests of rebirth.\n\n*Yu Dan Chang Sang*, *Bai Kong Du Xian*. The eight characters are the inner sound of the *Tan Shi* Heaven. *Yu Dan* is the name of the *Jade Capital* in the *Tan Shi* Heaven. *Chang Sang* is the *Qian Lin* (Soaring Grove) in heaven, also called the *Sang Lin* (Mulberry Grove). The *Qian Lin* shades the *Eastern Florescence* Palace, and upon its leaves are the great cavernous chapters, written in purple jade script, resplendent in the *Upper Clarity*. When the divine wind stirs, the cavernous chapters resound—hence *Bai Kong* (Cypress Void). *Du Xian* refers to the flying transcendent divine persons who review the registers of life and death for those who study immortality, delivering the souls of the Nine Darks and ascending them into the gate of the *Dharma Wheel*.\n\nThe Eight Heavens of the North:\n*Jue Wu Zi Yu*, *Jiu Ri Dao Qian*.",

      "translated_text": "The eight characters are the inner sound of the *Xiao Du* Heaven. *Jue Wu* refers to the divine beings of the *Dragon Han* era, the flying transcendent gods. From the primordial qi of the *Original Beginning*’s initial unfolding, within the boundless, formless *Ming Xing*, *Jue Wu* emerged borne by the currents, coalescing qi to take form. Once the Nine Heavens of *Xiao* were established, they withstood the unending kalpas. *Yu* is the inner name of the Heavenly King of *Xiao Du*. The *Nine* signifies that the *Yu* King rides a chariot drawn by elephant wheels, traversing the Nine Mysteries’ gates, revolving the Nine Mechanisms’ measures, aligning with the kalpa’s appointed time. The *Sun* refers to the solar youths within heaven who guide and harmonize qi; when the celestial revolution ends, the solar youths halt their radiance, delivering and refining the scholars, anointing them with the essence of the *Water Mother*, guiding them with the qi of *Great Harmony*, purifying the Five Spirits, and ushering them into the *Vermilion Palace*.\n\n*Guan Fu* says: *Qian* is the beginning of the myriad things, the spontaneous void, the pure and true unified qi, called the *Empty Qi Golden Womb*. It is likened to silver ore, concealed within the kidneys, termed the *Original Spirit*. As this qi transforms and returns to the *Central Palace*, it becomes the *Elixir Mother*, propelled by the *Metal Duke*. *Metal* is the qi of the primordial, spontaneous *Way*, the *Golden Womb*. *Fire* is the yang qi of daily arising and flourishing. Returning to the root and restoring the origin is called *silver*. The *Kun Mother* covers the east, her form gathering the *Upper Mystery*.\n\nThe eight characters are the inner sound of the *Yuan Dong* Heaven. The *Kun Mother* is the governor of the *Grand Yin*’s capital, the *Nine Numinous Immortal Mother*. She oversees the *Eastern Sea*’s *Fu Sang* and the *Yang Valley*’s abyss, perpetually managing the earth’s mechanisms, revolving the primordial qi, ascending to respond to the *Celestial Pass*. When the *Celestial Pass* turns, the earth’s mechanisms move, and once the heavens complete a revolution, the waters surge and overflow three thousand three hundred times. Thus, the qi of heaven and earth intermingle, the nine seas become misty and vast, and a single water pervades the heavens. The *East* is where the *Eastern Sea* receives convergence, controlling the river’s source. The *Covering* refers to the water spirit who governs *Kunlun Mountain*, reinforcing the great seas, damming the *Eastern Well*, ensuring the earth’s mechanisms do not sink, and preserving the kalpa’s enduring existence.\n\n*Guan Fu* says: *Kun* is the completion of the myriad things. After conception, the spirit is concealed within the kidneys, called the *Kun Palace*. It is both nature and lead, returning to the *Central Palace* in motion. The transforming mechanism is the daily arising yang qi, serving as the foundation of the elixir. The *Medicinal Ancestor* gathers cinnabar and mercury to form the elixir’s substance. As for creation, it arises from nothing into being; thus, *Kun* is established through *Qian*, and *Qian* is completed through *Kun*. *Qian* and *Kun* mutually engender and perfect one another, with no precedence of before or after. It is like lead arising from silver, and silver being perfected through lead. The *Form Gathering* occurs at the time of fixed union, when the *Kun Mother*’s form emerges above the *Eastern Sea*, summoning the *Bird Mother* and welcoming the immortality-seeking scholars with phoenix chariots to the wilds of *Kunlun*. The *Bird Mother* is the spirit overseeing the water’s conditions. The *Upper* refers to the *Kun Mother* ascending to the *Celestial Lord*, reporting the kalpa’s appointed time, delivering the immortality-seeking scholars, and inscribing their names in the *Mysterious Capital*.\n\n*Guan Fu* says: When the first yang returns, the wondrous transforming qi arises from the *Kun Palace*. The true yang ascends like the sun’s image, reaching the *Central Palace*, where the *Metal Mother* gathers it—this is called *cinnabar*. *Cinnabar* is wood; wood is the dragon. This is the *Azure Dragon* receiving the talisman.\n\n*Tuo Luo Yu Miao*, the ethereal qi merges with the clouds. The eight characters are the inner sound of the *Miao Cheng* Heaven. *Tuo* is the inner name of the *Celestial Emperor*, who resides with the *Miao Cheng* Heaven on the *Cloud Al* Ridge. *Luo* is the name of the moon at its first crescent, embracing the moon to shine upon the *Cloud Ridge*. *Yu* is the name of the divine king of the *Miao Cheng* Heaven. Also, *Yu* means *birth*, summoning the flying transcendent gods of the ten directions. *Miao* is the name of the *Feathered Forest* overseer in heaven, a divine king who perpetually assists in governing the Three Realms, reviewing the registers of human life and death, commanding demon kings to protect and recommend those who attain the Dao. *Shao* means *distant and lofty*. Those who are delivered and protected ascend to the *Feathered Forest* overseer, receive talismans, and ascend to heaven, traversing the cloud palaces in lofty flight. *Qi* is the cloud qi. *He* means *merging with the radiance*. Having entered the *Feathered Forest*, they weave cloud qi into garments, ascend to the *Vermilion Palace*, and then merge with the radiance of all heavens to soar upward.\n\nThe *Flying Transcendents’ Great Ugly One* oversees the heavens above. The eight characters are the inner sound of the *Jin Shang* Heaven. The *Flying Transcendents* are the divine kings of the flying transcendents in the ten directions. The flying and mysterious qi within heaven coalesce into the *Empty Cavern Scriptures*, which the flying transcendent divine kings perpetually recite to receive the scholars. The *Great Ugly One* is the registrar of the Three Realms, overseeing the charts of life and death. *Ugly* means *elder*. The great demons of the Three Realms serve the *Great Ugly One*. If scholars know this sound, demon kings will protect their authenticity, and their bodies will ascend to the *Three Clarities*. The *General* is the official who oversees the flying transcendents, governing the qi of the eight assemblies to hasten the heavens’ and earth’s revolutions, and presiding over the officials of the long night to deliver the souls of the *Nine Darks*. Those who know the sounds within heaven will have demon kings submit their names, and the *Great Ugly One* will inscribe them in the *Immortal Capital*, ascending to the *Jin Shang* Heaven.\n\n*Sha Tuo Jie Liang*, the *Dragon Han*’s radiant freshness. The eight characters are the inner sound of the *Chang Rong* Heaven. *Sha* is the *Sha Lan Palace* within heaven, a detached palace of the *Purple Tenuity*. *Tuo* is *Tuo Qiu Mountain*. The multitudes of *Tuo Qiu*, numbering in the hundreds of millions, are all newly delivered and refined individuals whose merits are not yet complete, lingering and dispersing therein. *Jie Liang* refers to when the kalpa’s revolution converges; the multitudes of *Tuo Qiu* calculate their merits and measure their virtues, ascending to *Zhu Lu* to receive blessings and immortality. *Dragon Han* is the name of the initial kalpa. *Ying* is the name of the flying transcendent divine king of the initial kalpa, who perpetually delivers the souls of the dark realms, ascending them to the *Sha Lan Palace*. *Xian* is the youth of the *Southern Palace*. When scholars attain deliverance, the immortal youths guide and refine them upon the *Vermilion Mound*.\n\n*Bi Luo Fu Li*, the empty songs preserve the treasures.",

      "translated_text": "The Eight Characters are the inner sounds of *Yu Long Heaven*. *Bi* refers to the ever-arising azure *qi* within *Yu Long Heaven*. *Luo* is the name of a flying transcendent deity who, thrice daily, leads the host of celestial sages to ascend and pay homage at the *Seven Treasures Palace*. *Fu Li* is the inner name of the Heavenly King; when the host of sages ascends to pay homage, the Heavenly King proclaims jubilation. *Kong* is the name of the celestial chamberlain. *Ge* refers to the cavernous hymns; when the chamberlain utters a single cry, numinous winds harmonize, and the sound forms the cavernous hymns—hence called *Kong Ge*. *Bao Zhen* means that if scholars comprehend the sound of these Eight Characters, they ascend to the *Southern Palace* as guests of the flying transcendents, preserving themselves through the unending kalpas and treasuring the natural script—thus called *Bao Zhen*.\n\n*E Yi* is without rank; cavernous subtlety is self-authentic. The Eight Characters are the inner sounds of *Fan Du Heaven*. *E Yi* is the inner name of the Heavenly King. During the *Dragon Han* kalpa, when all karmic conditions are exhausted, one transcends the Three Realms, ascends to the *Palace of Great Emptiness*, receives the register of the Nine Immortals, and attains the title of Great Sage. By the *Red Clarity* kalpa’s inception, the Primordial Beginning bestows the title of *Fan Du Heavenly King*. *Wu* is the *Great Void Perfected*; receiving the Heavenly King’s talisman, they deliver the souls of the long night. *Pin* refers to assessing the sins and blessings of the dark souls. *Dong* is the *Cavernous Clarity of Past Connections*. *Miao* is the *Hall of Wondrous Transformation*; when evil karma is exhausted and past connections are resolved, one ascends into the *Hall of Wondrous Transformation*. *Zi* means \"with.\" *Zhen* is *Heavenly Perfection*; thus, one unites with all heavens in perfection.\n\n*Yuan Fan* is vast and boundless, silently delivering beings in the dark and still. The Eight Characters are the inner sounds of *Jia Yi Heaven*. *Yuan Fan* is the *qi* of the Primordial Beginning’s Great Brahma—lofty and cavernously floating, suspended yet unfallen. *Hui Mo* is vast and limitless, distant yet unobstructed, existent yet as if nonexistent. *You* is the dark and desolate. *Ji* is the empty and silent—profound, indistinct, and imperceptible. Within it lies the Real; within the Real lies the Essence—thus universally delivering celestial and human beings.\n\n*Mo An* says: The meaning of the *Divine Book* is profoundly abstruse and difficult to fathom. Yet each direction comprises sixty-four characters, totaling sixty-four phrases, whose natural numerology precisely aligns with the sixty-four hexagrams of the *Great Change*. *Qian* and *Kun* are the progenitors of the *Change*; thus, only *Qian* and *Kun* are singled out, revealing that the myriad transformations of heaven, earth, the myriad things, and the myriad affairs cannot escape the *Change*. The traces of heaven, earth, ghosts, spirits, and creation likewise do not transcend the *Divine Book*—hence, one may infer by analogy. Moreover, the *River Chart* emerged, and Fuxi drew it to form the *Change*; the cloud-script of the Great Void gave rise to the jade characters, which the Heavenly Perfected inscribed to compose the text. The marvel of the divine way’s teachings inherently shares an unspoken resonance.\n\nThis humble one observes: The Heavenly Perfected said, \"The inner sounds of the heavens and the natural jade characters are all congealed from the *qi* of flying mystery, harmonizing the sounds of the five directions. Their script is profound and abstruse, difficult to fathom.\" Thus, the jade characters of the *Divine Book* emerge from the *qi* of the Great Brahma, congealing in emptiness to form script. The Perfected wielded the brush to unfold them into chapters—this is the root of heaven and earth, the origin of the myriad existences. Its silent concordance with the *Great Change*’s mechanism of yin-yang movement and stillness lies in the principle that the myriad existences are all endowed with the *River Chart*’s numbers of generation and completion. Therefore, one cultivates it internally to refine the self and applies it externally to deliver others—ultimately, the Dao is one with the singular root.\n\nThe Dao states: These are the great Brahma’s esoteric utterances within the heavens, the boundless sounds. The ancient script was all a *zhang* in length. The Heavenly Perfected of old inscribed the script to establish the correct sounds. Those who know these sounds and purify themselves to recite them will have the flying transcendent divine kings of all heavens descend to observe their bodies, record their merits, and report them above to the heavens. The myriad spirits pay homage, the earth spirits stand guard at the gates, and even the mighty demon kings will safeguard and recommend them for ascension to immortal ranks. When their Dao is complete and their merits fulfilled, they may roam the Three Realms, ascend through the *Golden Gate*, and serve the Three Realms, daily attending the Emperor’s side.\n\n*Mo An* says: The ancient script refers to the original form of the jade characters when they first emerged—what is now transmitted as celestial seal-script. This is the concluding discourse of the *Dao Lord* on the marvels of the *Divine Book*. *Great Brahma* refers to the natural wondrous *qi* of the heavens congealing to form script. *Esoteric utterances* are the hidden names and taboos of the Heavenly Emperor. *Boundless sounds* are the cavernous natural sounds that resonate through all heavens, endowing boundless merit. *Ancient script* refers to when the Primordial Beginning first expounded the scriptures and the Perfected first wielded the brush—all were celestial Brahma *qi* congealing to form script. Thus, the characters were all a *zhang* in length, inscribed in jade and gold, with eight corners radiating light—later transmitted as celestial seal-script, hence called *ancient script*. The Perfected of old inscribed the script to establish the correct sounds; what is now transmitted are the later translations compiled into chapters—these are the ancient correct sounds. Those who know the sounds and purify themselves to recite them will evoke the heavens to dispatch divine kings to descend, observe, and record their merits, reporting them above. Then, the myriad spirits will pay reverent homage, the earth spirits will stand guard, and even the mighty demon kings will safeguard and recommend them for ascension to immortal ranks. *Dao complete* means that when their merits are perfected and their conduct fulfilled, they may roam above the Three Realms, ascend through the *Golden Gate*, and serve the Three Realms, daily attending the Emperor’s side.\n\n*Guan Fu* says: Within it, the empty and the solid interpenetrate, and the images and numbers are visible. Applying the nine days to guide *Qian*’s reckoning, no principle is left unaddressed. *Qian* begins in the north, just as yang arises at *zi*. *Jia* corresponds to *Qian*, and *zi* is the *Yellow Bell*—thus, *jia-zi* begins at the winter solstice. The *Returning Elixir* is but the cultivation of the great Brahma’s cyclic refinement. The Four Symbols, Five Phases, Three Origins, Eight Trigrams, sun and moon, dragon and tiger, cinnabar and mercury, lead and silver—all are contained within the esoteric utterances. As for the *yin* tally and *yang* fire, the warming and nurturing, the withdrawal and addition—without relying on the hexagrams’ rise and fall, the cyclic progression of *jia-zi*, how could one take them as a model?",

      "translated_text": "Thus, the four hexagrams *Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, and *Li* symbolize heaven, earth, sun, and moon, embracing the myriad things as the crucible, vessel, medicine, and pivot of the root and origin. The remaining sixty hexagrams correspond to the sixty *jia-zi* cycles. Following the shifts of spring and autumn, cold and heat divide into twenty-four *qi*, likened to seventy-two seasonal markers, aligning with the twelve months of the year. Distilled into a single month, its seasonal signs are compressed within the twelve hours of day and night—fixing the water clock, rectifying the sundial, clarifying *zi* and *wu*, regulating *yin* and *yang*, harmonizing darkness and dawn, balancing weights and measures—all in accord with heaven and earth’s grand reckoning and the transformative mechanism of *yin* and *yang*. Thus, the hexagrams comprise three hundred eighty-four lines, and fire is measured by three hundred eighty-four *zhu*; through this, the myriad things arise from emptiness, and the principle of the great Brahma is in truth identical to that of the *Great Change*. Herein, the teachings of all masters silently converge, and the elixir and the *Change* have never diverged in their path. If the scholar can fathom the subtle mysteries of the *Numinous Writ*, then the foundation of the elixir and the Dao of the *Change* are attained.\n\nThis sound repels all, dispels all, delivers all, and accomplishes all. It is the sound of heaven’s spontaneity. Reciting it summons flight to behold the realms below, the Celestial Thearch’s distant chant, the myriad spirits’ courtly obeisance, and the Three Realms’ attendance at the imperial chariot. Hosts of demons bow their heads, ghostly essences vanish of themselves. Jade chimes resound, the ten directions grow hushed, rivers and seas fall silent, mountains and peaks swallow their mists. The ten thousand spirits tremble and submit, summoning the immortals of the grasses. Heaven is free of defilement, earth is free of demonic dust. Profound wisdom illumines the void—vast and profoundly profound.\n\n*Mo’an* says: The Dao Lord here expounds the efficacy of the scholar’s recitation. This sound is the sound of boundlessness. Reciting it can expel all demonic influences, dissolve all calamities, deliver all from birth and death, and perfect all celestial and human beings. Its merit extends everywhere without exception, hence the reiteration: the sound of heaven’s spontaneity. These are the words of the perfected of the highest heavens, uttered by the spontaneous *qi* of the Brahma realm—not the fabricated sounds of the human world. Thus, its merit is unparalleled. Reciting it thus enables flight to survey the world below, and its merit is recorded. The Celestial Thearch chants from afar in praise, the myriad spirits offer courtly homage, and the body’s spirits attend the imperial chariot across the Three Realms. At this stage, the Three Worms hide in submission, the Six Thieves retreat in concealment, demonic hordes bow their heads, external demons instantly cease, ghostly essences perish of themselves, and inner delusions instantly vanish. Once karmic consciousness is purified and defilements are emptied, only the original nature and the True Unity remain.\n\nThe jade chimes’ resonance signifies the union of form and spirit in transcendence, where celestial music arises spontaneously. The ten directions’ hush signifies utter stillness without remnant sound. Rivers and seas’ silence signifies the love-river and sea of suffering both stilled. Mountains and peaks swallowing mists signify their inner solidity, where spirit congeals and breath settles. The ten thousand spirits trembling in submission signify the perfection of merit and completion of the Dao, where none fail to submit. The summoning of the host of immortals signifies the myriad spirits’ audience at the origin, gathering unbidden. Heaven free of defilement and earth free of demonic dust signify the quiescence of nature and the obscurity of emotion, merging with the Great Void. Profound wisdom illumining the void: *profound* denotes the secluded and boundless; *wisdom* denotes clarity without limit; *illumining* denotes unimpeded luminosity; *void* denotes limpid purity without end. This is what *Guanfu* calls the power of obscure penetration and luminous insight. At this stage of inner cultivation, the eight directions are thoroughly illuminated, the singular nature merges in fusion, vast enough to embrace the cosmos, subtle enough to enter the tip of a hair—all these are the wondrous subtleties of the supremely profound and minute, whose measure cannot be fathomed by any shore or boundary. This is called the vast and profoundly profound.\n\nThe vastness of heaven and earth, the multitude of the ten thousand beings, the crawling and fluttering creatures—all contain the wondrous essence of the singular spirit, each arising from non-being, all presaged by the Supreme Ultimate, the Five Phases, and *yin-yang* before attaining wholeness. The Supreme Ultimate’s singular root does not conceal itself amid the myriad differences, but returns to the origin of soundlessness and scentlessness, reverting to the Ultimateless. When the Heavenly Worthy expounded the scripture, he began by suspending a single precious pearl to unfold the ten revolutions’ wondrous meaning, wherein the secrets of the great Brahma and the mysteries of the elixir path are fully contained. In its conclusion, he yet feared that disciples might fall into the bias of sinking into emptiness or clinging to existence, and thus declared: *Profound wisdom illumines the void—vast and profoundly profound.* Herein lies the essentials of the entire scripture and the subtleties of the millet-pearl. How could any fabricated dharmas or images attain this? This is what is meant by *accord with emptiness and union with non-being*, reverting to the Ultimateless. It lies in returning to seek within oneself, where the numinous remains undimmed, heaven and earth are complete within me, and the supremely divine and wondrous Dao is attained.\n\n*The Diagram of the Millet-Pearl Suspended in Ten Revolutions*\n*The Diagram of the Golden Elixir’s Ten Transformations and Four Spirits*",

The Four Symbols, Five Phases, Three Origins, Eight Trigrams, sun and moon, dragon and tiger, cinnabar and mercury, lead and silver—all are contained within the esoteric utterances. As for the *yin* tally and *yang* fire, the warming and nurturing, the withdrawal and addition—without relying on the hexagrams’ rise and fall, the cyclic progression of *jia-zi*, how could one take them as a model?",

      "translated_text": "**The Middle Scroll: Diagram of the Yi’s Fire Phases**\n**The Supreme Ultimate Diagram: Explanation of the Primordial Qi’s Complete and Wondrous Function in Its Entirety**\n\nThe Chaos of Crimson Script, the Perfect Real of the Non-Non and Primordial Above—this is what is meant by *the Ultimateless and yet the Supreme Ultimate*. In the primordial kalpa of the Origin Ancestor, the myriad heavens were transformed and brought forth; the Three Luminaries were illumined, forming the Root of Heaven. Above, there is no further ancestor—only the Dao is its body. This is what is meant by *the Supreme Ultimate moves and generates yang; when movement reaches its limit, it becomes still. Stillness generates yin; when stillness reaches its limit, it moves again. In one movement and one stillness, each becomes the root of the other. Yin and yang divide, and the Two Modes are established.*\n\nThe Five Scripts unfold and expand—this is what is meant by *yang transforms, yin conjoins, and water, fire, wood, metal, and earth are born. The Five Agents arrange themselves in order, and the four seasons proceed.* The Five Agents are one with yin-yang; yin-yang is one with the Supreme Ultimate; the Supreme Ultimate is fundamentally the Ultimateless. Universally planting the numinous, without script there is no illumination, no clarity, no establishment, no completion, no deliverance, no generation. This is what is meant by *the true of the Ultimateless, the essence of the Two and Five, wondrously conjoined and coagulated. The Qian Dao forms the male; the Kun Dao forms the female. The two qi interact and transform, giving birth to the myriad things. The myriad things ceaselessly generate and transform without end.*\n\n**The Diagram of the Primordial Qi’s Complete and Wondrous Function**—scholars must investigate its meaning, for then the precelestial Dao will unconsciously accord, and the subtleties of creation may be glimpsed. Thus, the Confucian, knowing the causes of the hidden and the manifest, encompasses the myriad things, tracing origins and returning to endings, exhausting principle and fulfilling nature, attains the wondrousness of life and death without delusion. The Old Master says: *Deeply root, firmly stem—long life and enduring vision.* Each has its own tradition.\n\nHow, then, is this achieved? The scripture says: *Know the masculine, guard the feminine—return to the state of an infant. Know the white, guard the black—return to the Ultimateless.* This is the Dao of the Golden Liquid Returned Elixir. Thus can one *probe the root, firm the stem—long life and enduring vision.* Following this doctrine of *observing and returning*, Master Mo’an adopted it.\n\n**Postscript by the Heavenly Lord Xin of the Azure Emperor, Descended in Writing, on Master Mo’an’s Copy of the *Wu Chang Wei Fang* Text**\n\nThe scripture is transmitted by the heart; the scripture is realized by the heart. Heart realizes, heart transmits—heaven and humanity are universally delivered. With this heart, the Emperor will favor you. Sincerely receive and practice it—good deeds are well done.\n\nIn the fifth month of the *gengyin* year, the Heavenly Lord Xin descended in writing, saying: *Disciples are single-minded; believers are sincere. Moved by my teachings of the Chaos Primordial Scripture, I have come to the altar. Great is the Numinous Treasure Scripture of Delivering Humanity—it is not composed by mere literary art. All scriptures must perish when kalpas end, yet this text alone remains in the Jade Capital.*\n\nFrom ancient times to the present, no sage, immortal, or buddha has attained the Dao without revering the scripture of delivering humanity. Among all scriptures, the Primordial Beginning’s *Scripture of Deliverance* is the supreme. The scripture—when yang, it arouses good thoughts in people; when yin, it opens the way to deliver hidden spirits. Its merit is without peer.\n\nI shall speak to you with my ears; you shall listen to my words with your mouth. Ah! Listen with the mouth—here lies the mutual functioning of the six roots, the wondrousness of the Chaos Primordial. Do you, disciples, reciting the *Scripture of Deliverance*, yet know its profound subtleties? The human heart is the precious pearl; the original spirit is the Primordial Beginning. Beyond the spirit, there is no Heavenly Worthy; beyond the heart, there is no Dao or Dharma. Does one who deceives the heart not obscure Heaven?\n\nAt the outset of recitation, gather the myriad thoughts into one—this is the Primordial Beginning summoning the ten directions. Reciting the scripture with right mindfulness is the Primordial Beginning expounding the scripture. When thoughts of emotion and the conscious spirit do not wander recklessly, it is the ten directions listening to the scripture. Forgetting emotion and severing thought—this is the state of silence without lingering echoes. When nature is pure and undivided, the true and false both return. With a single, undivided will, over time one naturally becomes pure. The myriad delusions return to the true—this is the deliverance of heaven and humanity. If you grasp this, you will naturally reach the realm of formlessness. The demons of the myriad thoughts will all be transformed by me—then you are a true person. This is the essence of the scripture.\n\nYet if one recites the scripture without understanding this principle, failing to gather thoughts or return to the true, even reciting ten thousand times a day—what benefit is there to me? As for the section on refinement and deliverance, it is even more difficult to speak of. If one does not know the essence of the scripture, how can one deliver others?\n\nIf you grasp the *Pearl Suspended in Emptiness*, able to gather the myriad thoughts and return to the true, with a single, unmoving will, like the Primordial Beginning, in one hour you will naturally reach the state of silence without lingering echoes—joy and celebration beyond words. At this point, the ghosts and gods of the Three Realms all revere and fear you; all hidden spirits are delivered.\n\nThe refinement and deliverance of hidden spirits is a great merit and virtue. The ancient immortals and buddhas all cultivated themselves as merit and delivered others as virtue—only then could they achieve both merit and conduct in full.\n\nI am an official of thunder. In the remote past, I had already attained the supreme Dao, then later reincarnated into the Thunder Bureau, driving wind and thunder, bringing rain and dew, and generating the myriad things. Thunder is the Heavenly Emperor’s staff of authority, the power of the Emperor, the pivot of the Dao. The power of life and death is governed by thunder; its transformations are endless, its merit without peer. That I can give life and take it is because I practice benevolence and righteousness. Benevolence is the office of spring, generating the myriad things; righteousness is the office of autumn, bringing solemn execution to the myriad things. Assisting Heaven and Earth, enacting the four seasons, acting on behalf of the Supreme Emperor to govern the world’s fortunes—I also ceaselessly cultivate merit and virtue.\n\nIf one attains the Dao but does not aid others, what benefit is there to the Supreme Emperor? Even the Jade Emperor, having attained the Dao after ten thousand kalpas, still presides over the world’s fortunes—how much more so for us!\n\nYou disciples, having entered my Dao and Dharma, must embody this intent. You are all the finest among my disciples, which is why I have spoken thus far—not to leak the secrets of thunder and confuse your assembly. You may single-mindedly cultivate and revere it; I will assist your Dao’s influence from the altar. If you encounter calamities hereafter, you may focus your will, revere one deity, recite one scripture—and thus preserve yourself.",
