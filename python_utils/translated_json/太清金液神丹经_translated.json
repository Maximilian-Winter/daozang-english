  "full_translation": "**The Supreme Clarity Scripture of the Divine Elixir of Golden Liquor**\n\n**Title:** *The Supreme Clarity Scripture of the Divine Elixir of Golden Liquor*\n**Attributed to:** Zhang Daoling, Yin Changsheng, and Ge Hong (Baopuzi), et al.\n**Approximate date:** Late Eastern Jin dynasty\n**Content:** External alchemy, including methods of transmuting cinnabar and lead (huangbai), with additional practices on circulating *qi* and maintaining unity.\n**Three scrolls.**\n**Source text:** *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Comprehensive Arts* section under the *Cavernous Divine* category.\n\n---\n\n### *The Supreme Clarity Scripture of the Divine Elixir of Golden Liquor, Scroll One*\n**Preface by the Orthodox Celestial Master Zhang Daoling**\n\nThe mystery of the Void is nameless, yet we designate it as the *Dao*. The term *Dao* signifies awakening. Just as one who sleeps through the night awakens at dawn, so too does the great dream precede the great awakening. At the extremity of awakening from dreams, how can it be lightly described?\n\nClinging to life is weakness and loss; delighting in death is joy in nothingness. Yet joy in nothingness is still a lack, and clinging to existence is delusion. Even delight in nothingness fails to attain true understanding. Only through transcendent observation—where both are forgotten—does one return to the Mystery. Having forgotten, one must then forget even the act of forgetting. Mind and intellect dissolve into the realm of being and non-being, while spirit and essence congeal in the profoundest Mystery. This is the realization of those who exhaust principle and fulfill their nature.\n\nLike a potter’s clay, they subtly shape the path of effortless transformation, responding silently to the myriad stimuli of the world. Scattered yet near, they traverse the depths of the obscure and the luminous, for their achievement cannot be confined to a single form nor verified by a single name.\n\nThe titles of emperors and kings have never been uniform. Why then doubt the *Dao* alongside Yao and Confucius? The distinction lies merely in inner and outer teachings, hence the depth or shallowness of their principles.\n\nIf we seek in the physical form, we find wonders: scaled bodies with four breasts, double pupils and multicolored brows—all extraordinary. Jinyun, born speaking, sat in audience with the hundred spirits, ruled the realm, rode clouds to command tigers and leopards, and at life’s end ascended in transcendence, mounting a flying dragon to depart the six directions. Yet when one surveys the world within the Red Continent, the affairs of bowing and rising seem as fleeting as children playing in a courtyard, vying for a single toy.\n\nThere are also those who, like guests reclining on pillows in the hollows of Mount Kongtong, follow the wind’s course and converse on the *Dao* of nurturing spirit. These are the grand discourses on order and chaos in the world, where refinement and coarseness differ. Yet even those who inquire deeply, their hair like mist at the windows, have not yet penetrated the inner chambers.\n\nAs for the subtleties of spiritual transformation and the most wondrous teachings—the supreme principle beyond principle, the great \"thusness\" beyond \"thusness\"—these are fully expounded in the Mysterious Tradition, not to be conveyed by a single hair’s breadth.\n\nLaozi, too, elucidated the Mystery of the Void and recorded the *Dao*. His divine virtue and the circumstances of his manifestations inspired him to compose scriptures, establish teachings, and document extraordinary accounts. He harmonized the *Dao* and the secular, distinguishing the three realms. First, he illuminated the principles of compliance and defiance, then swept them away in the forgetting of both. He extolled virtue yet ultimately governed it with non-being. His utility in action and stillness remains unseen in its origins. The people use it daily, unaware of its source. Such is his authority, manifest in clarity and serving as the bridge for all things.\n\nHis *Dao* is scripture; his virtue is scripture. Tracing the lineage to its origin, exhausting the Mystery to its subtleties, he gathers all branches to the true root and unites ten thousand strands in one essential. Vast and unbroken, luminous yet not dazzling, he both penetrates the ultimate *Dao* and humbly expands its worldly teachings.\n\nHis words are profound yet not obscure, distant yet savorable. Majestic and lofty, expansive and grand, they exalt the joy of the Three Ones and the mirror of the Six Nines. Through breath-holding and prolonged respiration, one contends for the years of the three luminaries. Through embryonic nurturing of the Five, one attains the attainment of the numinous perfected. Clear as the kind wind striking jade, radiant as the morning sun illuminating a treasury of gems.\n\nHis governance is all-encompassing, perfecting all without omission. At first, it seems towering and dense; in the end, it is subtle and formless. He smelts the myriad images in the crucible of the Mystery, guiding all differences to a single return.\n\nIn his analogies, he is discerning yet not divergent, broad yet not disordered. Subtle yet manifest, discordant yet harmonious, he embraces the strange and wondrous within the great square, transcending obscurity and difference to naturally align. Great is this wondrous chant—truly divine! The extremity of discourse on principle cannot be surpassed.\n\nAs for the efficacy of the Golden Elixir: its numinous workings are profound, its transformations obscure. The dragon transmutes, the spirit illumines, the two unite as one. Those who are withered and cut off revive; those who embrace the vital breath attain long years. Ascending the luminous Han to soar beyond, roaming the cloud peaks in freedom—even the face and body radiate jade light, sprouting rare fur. They spit water and rinse with fire, fly without wings, divide their forms into ten thousand changes, and act at will. They dam rivers without effort, cleave mountains without axes. With a shout, clouds and rain darken the sky; with a gesture, forests shift. Their divinity is beyond record, their wonders beyond omission. Great is the numinous essence—inexpressible in full!\n\nDaoling, born later and unenlightened, never met the great assembly. Adrift without bound, a thousand years have passed. The divine masters have upheld the Way, guiding me across perilous straits. Emerging from my own confusion, I gaze upward at the level path of the Mystery—unbarred and open. Not that it cannot be opened, but that I lacked the ability.\n\nMy disciples have secretly observed the Mysterious Root and grasped the key to its gate. My disciples Zhao Sheng and Wang Chang, reflecting on their shadows and pressing their hearts, were overwhelmed with shame and remorse. Their spiritual insight was boundless, and they encountered the profound person of Mysterious Clarity. Their inner mirrors stood firm, first extracting what their diligence had penetrated. Thus, they glimpsed the mysteries of the supreme sages, overheard their meanings, and provisionally offered explanations. They transformed their observations and aspirations, recording what they had witnessed. They marked and compared the lofty principles, then measured and composed annotations.\n\nThe preface states: \"First illuminate compliance and defiance, then sweep them away in the forgetting of both\"—this is for the sake of preserving life. To go against life is defiance; to nurture life is compliance.\n\nThose who attain compliance do not dwell on defiance; those who attain defiance do not scrutinize compliance. This is called the divergent principles of life and death, the boundary of attaining the One. The forgetting of \"forgetting both\" means each forgets what they ought to forget—just as the well-dwelling fish does not delight in becoming a sea-scaled creature, nor the forest beast wish to be an ox or horse. Each receives life differently, for their heavenly endowments are inherently distinct.\n\nThe preface states: \"First extol those of virtue, then unify them through non-reliance\"—this refers to Lord Lao’s practice of *xingqi* (circulating qi) and *daoyin* (guiding and pulling), inhaling and exhaling the fluid of Great Harmony. Extolling inhalation ensures the attainment of qi; unifying the subtle and void through exhalation and absorption smooths the passageways, leaving no reliance or harm. Emerging from the Mysterious and entering the Mysterious, breath flows without question, embodying both body and spirit, never departing from the person.\n\nThe preface states: \"Beneficial use permeates all living beings, yet its origin remains unseen. The common people daily employ it for good, unaware of its source—this is its authority manifest in clarity, serving as the bridge for the myriad things.\" Now, this beneficial use is the spirit and qi. Spirit and qi daily serve the body’s functions, yet the multitude does not recognize their origin. Spirit and qi daily sustain the four limbs, yet the foolish masses do not know they depend on them to live. A person cannot be without qi for even a moment, nor can they lose their spirit through carelessness. Losing spirit causes the five viscera to decay; losing qi leads to collapse and death. The corpse gains life through qi; the skeleton remains whole through qi. Qi and spirit move in tandem; spirit and qi constantly rely on each other for strength. When spirit departs, qi vanishes; when qi fades, the body perishes. Though all people fear death and delight in life, they do not know that the work of living lies in spirit and qi. Thus, they repeatedly agitate their minds and offend their qi, frequently indulge their spirits and wither their lives. Those who do not cherish stillness and fail to preserve their true nature will surely meet premature decay. Yet if one does not seek longevity, this authority manifests in clarity. Clarity is the light of the sun and moon. Though one may witness the sun and moon’s eternal flow, none can escape the traces of calamity among the myriad things. When the myriad things sense the fault of gain and loss, life must then have its bridge and barrier. Calamity will surely arise, and mutual opposition will emerge. The enlightened must therefore cherish essence and guard qi to seek prolonged vision. Harmonizing and nurturing all things brings the blessing of branches and leaves.\n\nThe preface states: \"In the grandeur of solitary observation, one delights in the Three Ones and marks the mirror to cultivate the Six-Nines’ positions.\" Closing the void and prolonging breath contends for the years of the Three Luminaries. Nurturing the five elements seeks the attainment of numinous perfection. The Three Ones refer to the three regions: brain, heart, and navel. The Upper One, the Mud-Pill Palace Lord, resides in the head; the Middle One, the Crimson Palace Lord, dwells in the heart; the Lower One, the Cinnabar Field Lord, abides in the navel. Preserving them makes the Three Palaces resplendent; neglecting them leaves the body in profound stillness. Those who cherish life delight in preserving them; those who court death abandon them for fleeting joy. Thus, the grandeur of solitary observation delights in the Three Ones.\n\nAs the *Immortal Classic* states: \"If you desire long life, the Three Ones must be illuminated. The Dao is precisely here.\" From midnight to noon is the time of generative qi; from noon to midnight is the time of dead qi. Always lie supine during the time of generative qi, close your eyes, clench your fists, and hold your breath within the heart, counting to two hundred before exhaling. Increase the count daily. In this way, body and spirit unite, the five viscera find peace. If you can hold your breath to two hundred and fifty, the Crimson Palace’s spirit guards, the Mud-Pill remains full, and the Cinnabar Field flourishes. At three hundred, the Flowery Canopy shines, ears and eyes grow keen, the whole body becomes free of illness, and noxious qi no longer invades. Jade maidens come as attendants, granting boundless longevity—this is marking the mirror to cultivate the Six-Nines’ positions. The Six refers to exhalation and absorption governing the six qi; the Nine refers to the ranks of the nine elixirs. The Lady of Supreme Perfection, Wang, has already recorded these. Lord Lao said: \"From dawn to dusk, practice unceasingly, and you will attain long life.\"\n\nIn the method of *xingqi*, there is one internal qi and six exhalations. The one internal qi refers to inhalation. The six exhalations—blowing, exhaling, sighing, humming, hissing, and swallowing—are all ways of expelling qi. Every person’s breath consists of one inhalation and one exhalation. To prolong life, the breath should be long and unified. The method of breath regulation: when cold, blow; when warm, exhale. Blow to dispel cold, exhale to dispel heat, sigh to dispel illness, hum to dispel wind, hum softly to dispel vexation and lower qi, hiss to disperse stagnation, and swallow to relieve exhaustion. When people are exhausted, they often sigh and swallow. Daoist practitioners of *xingqi* avoid sighing and swallowing, for these are the forgetting of prolonged breath. Mastering the six qi leads to becoming a Heavenly Immortal. Cultivating natural spirit and qi means marking and embracing the Nine Elixirs’ positions—this is called the mirror. The mirror’s mark lies in the elixir classics’ qi preservation, ensuring distant years and an unfallen lifespan.\n\nThe preface states: \"Closing, hissing, and prolonging breath to contend for the years of the Three Luminaries\"—this refers to all methods of *xingqi*. The method of *xingqi* begins with settling the body, dispelling all anger and sorrow, releasing all worries, and harmonizing the qi without contention. If harmony is absent, cease practice. Only when the body is at ease should one proceed, maintaining constancy without weariness. When qi arrives, the form finds peace; when the form is at peace, breath harmonizes; when breath harmonizes, pure qi arrives; when pure qi arrives, one naturally senses prolonged breath. If the body grows hot, open the mouth slightly and close it to savor the sweet fragrance. As fluids increase, the five viscera endure, and endurance brings longevity equal to heaven, earth, and the Three Luminaries.\n\n\"Nurturing the five elements to seek the attainment of numinous perfection\" refers to fetal nourishment and guiding cultivation. The method of fetal nourishment: at dawn, rinse the mouth with water and swallow until sated—this too brings long life.\n\nHaving been born in satiety, the five viscera naturally attain numinous efficacy, and the attainment of numinous perfection lies precisely herein.\n\nThe *Scriptures of the Immortals* state: \"With the jade pool’s pure water, irrigate the numinous root.\" The *Supreme Clarity Scripture of the Divine Elixir of Golden Liquor*, Scroll the First, declares: \"If one can cultivate this, one may endure forever. Press it to yield clear water, fair and fresh.\"\n\nThe mouth is the \"jade pool\" and the \"Palace of Grand Harmony.\" As for what is called \"natural consumption,\" those who nurture life rely solely on qi and the elixir. The subtle and profound teachings of the scriptures are abstruse and difficult to expound. Having once heard the master’s instruction, I now set it forth here.\n\nAs for the esoteric words of Kongtong, which elucidate the mysterious perfection of the Dao and virtue, these have already been expounded in the past. Since they are not essential to present practice, further elaboration would be superfluous. To reiterate or annotate them would only invite redundancy and prolixity; let those of the Way in times to come cultivate them accordingly.\n\nTo prepare the Six-One Clay, the finest days are the fifth day of the fifth month, the seventh day of the seventh month, and the ninth day of the ninth month. Auspicious days for kindling the elixir fire are jia-shen, yi-si, and yi-mao. Days to avoid when compounding the elixir are:\n\n**Spring:** wu-chen, ji-si\n**Summer:** ding-si, wu-shen, ren-chen, ji-wei\n**Autumn:** wu-xu, xin-hai, geng-zi\n**Winter:** wu-yin, ren-xu, ji-mao, gui-you\n\nAlso to be avoided are the monthly killers, counter-branch days, the first, middle, and last days of the month, days of closure (bing-xu, ding-hai, ren-xu, gui-hai, xin-si), the monthly establishment, all dark moons and new moons, the eight baleful stars, days of wandering death—all these are inauspicious and will not yield success.\n\nWhen procuring the divine medicine, one should do so in a place of virtue, seated or standing, without haggling over price. The transaction should occur on a day of receipt. Bathe on a zi or chou day, first maintaining purification for seven days, then procure the authentic ingredients of the divine elixir. Once completed, store it in a silken brocade pouch or a golden cylinder.\n\nWhen compounding the divine medicine, begin on a jia-zi day of the \"opening\" or \"removal\" phase. First purify oneself for three times seven days, then proceed to compound the medicine, with no more than two or three persons present. Exercise utmost care and avoid entering households tainted by mourning or defilement.\n\nWhen sublimating the medicine, do not allow fools, women, children, those in mourning, the defiled, the envious, the garrulous, or those who do not believe in the Dao to witness it. If such persons see or hear of it, the medicine will fail, and its spirit will flee.\n\nThe ideal location is a secluded mountain forest or stone chamber, far from human habitation, where neither the barking of dogs nor the voices of men can be heard. Furthermore, one must avoid the sight of the dead, the wounded, or blood—beware of this.\n\nOnce the divine medicine is prepared, dwell alone in a chamber, for the divine immortals and jade maidens, along with their attending officials, will come and go. One must revere them. Carry the divine elixir constantly at the elbow, and in all self-cultivation, vigilance and caution are paramount.\n\nWhen compounding the medicine, use a jia-zi day, preferably one of the \"opening\" or \"removal\" phase, for greater efficacy. Continuously burn incense and maintain purification for three times seven days. For the first seven-day purification, remain present throughout the night.\n\nWhen setting up the cauldron and preparing the altar, offer sacrifice to the Supreme Unity, the Most High Perfected Divinity. Use two *hu* of clear wine, three *hu* each of yellow millet and white non-glutinous rice (taking two *dou* of each to steam), two *dou* of large dried jujubes, three *dou* of pears, five *dou* each of salt and fermented beans, ten *jin* of incense, and fine cakes and fruits such as sweet oranges (if sweet oranges are unavailable in the north, omit them). Prepare four woven mats for the offering. Use nine clean trays and eighty-one cups; if cups are unavailable, large bowls may suffice. After the ritual, burn the mats and trays entirely.\n\nThe sacrifice should resemble that offered to the gods of heaven and earth. Arrange the utensils oneself, setting out all items and placing them appropriately for the compounding of the elixir. The officiant should wear new, clean clothes, fasten the sash, and use nine incense burners, ensuring the smoke intertwines. Place one incense burner on each of the nine trays.\n\nThe officiant, kneeling, should bow twice and prostrate twice, then declare:\n*\"I, a humble servant of the Great Dao, so-and-so, bow twice and prostrate twice again.\"* Repeat this as before, making a total of eighteen bows.\n\nAfter inviting the gods, ensure the voice carries ten paces. Then, standing, invoke the following in a slow, measured tone:\n*\"The Nine Heavenly Perfected Kings, the Three Heavenly Perfected Sovereigns, the Most High Sovereign Lord, the August Sovereign Lord, the Supreme Lord, the Supreme Thearch, the Nine Heavenly Three Venerable Lords, the Three Heavenly Three Venerable Lords, the Supreme Perfected, the Supreme Earthly Perfected, the Numinous Perfected Jade Maidens, the Nine Qi Elders, the Nine Elder Immortals of the Immortal Capital, the Supreme Clarity Immortal King, the Heavenly Perfected Supreme Unity Lord, the Earthly Perfected Supreme Unity Lord, the Capital Supreme Unity Lord, the Central Supreme Unity Lord, the Immortal Supreme Unity Lord, the Earthly Immortal Supreme Unity Lord, the Supreme Unity Jade Lads, the Jade Maidens, the Yellow Silk and Purple Radiance Two Lords, the Yellow Silk and Purple Radiance Two Ladies, the Canopy of Flowering Fire Radiance Envoy, the Nine Radiance Elder, the Vermilion Ancestral Lord of the Southern Luminaries—may you all open the gates of heaven, descend upon my seat in clouds, and attend this rite.\"*\n\nThe officiant then bows nine times, kowtows nine times, and strikes the breast nine times, kneeling upright. Lowering the voice further, he continues slowly:\n*\"On this day, month, and year, I, so-and-so of such-and-such prefecture, county, village, and hamlet, of such-and-such name and style, aged so many years, humbly invoke the Most High Sacred Divinities of the Nine and Three Heavens to descend upon this mountain.\"*\n\nAfter a long pause, he continues in a measured tone:\n*\"I truly know not the origins of heaven and earth since their inception, nor the ancestral surname from which I descend, nor from which lineage I spring. I know not from what kind of creature—be it beast, spring, fish, or flying and crawling thing—I emerged, nor the origins of the Hu, Qiang, Yi, Di, Xianbei, or Xian Di. I know not from which direction I was born, nor the nature of the Eight Southern Man barbarians, the Six Western Rong, the Five Northern Di, or the Nine Eastern Yi. I know not from which quarter I came, nor how we have lived, transmitted, and nourished one another, accumulating countless calamities and transgressions, enduring endless punishments and retributions. Thus, my seven generations of ancestors, my five generations of forebears, my three generations of great-grandparents, my grandparents, and my parents have all borne the sins of past lives without number. Some have been exiled to hell, bearing mountains of stone, consigned to the River Earls, or subjected to the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water—molten copper poured down their throats, tongues torn out, cast into the vast currents, their souls weighed and tormented, fed thorns, heads scorched, backs branded with iron, enduring the cycles of life and death. The punishments and retributions for their transgressions and offenses are manifold.\"*\n\nMay I beseech the Nine Heavens, the Three Heavens, the August Supreme Unity, and all the lords and elders to absolve the calamities and punishments I have incurred since my seven generations past. May all my transgressions—those of my present life through countless kalpas, my myriad deaths, my myriad sins, and my myriad faults—be wholly pardoned. May I behold the era of Great Peace and gaze upon the true and sagely sovereign.\n\nWith this entreaty, I rise and perform nine prostrations, nine kowtows, and nine self-strikes. Then, offering wine anew, I kneel and say: From my youth, I have cherished the pursuit of longevity and yearned for the numinous immortals. Formerly, I received from my late master, so-and-so, the method of the Golden Liquor. Now, in this auspicious year, month, and hour, I prepare to compound it. Yet, not daring to act alone, I first humbly present this offering.\n\nI prostrate myself and pray that the Most High Lord Lao, the Lord of Supreme Harmony, the Heavenly Illuminated Divine Immortals, the Mysterious Maiden and the Plain Maiden, and the Azure-Waisted Jade Maidens may descend to assist in its completion. May the various Lords of the Supreme Unity and the Jade Maidens of the Supreme Unity deign to oversee and witness beneath the Yellow and Purple Canopies.\n\nI humbly beseech that the medicine neither scatter nor stray, neither fly nor soar. May it transform at my touch, transmuting all into yellow and white, ascending to the Purple Palace. May my life span extend for billions of millennia, and may I attain the rank of Perfected One. May I harmonize the divine qi and the radiant essence, the primordial and celestial qi, with the Supreme Unity as my guardian and the Jade Maidens as my constant attendants. May all the lords and elders erase the record of my death-sentence and inscribe my name in the register of the living.\n\nAgain, I rise and perform nine bows, nine kowtows, and nine self-strikes, offering wine and increasing the incense.\n\nAfter a while, I kneel once more and say: Now, within this mountain cavern, I compound the divine elixir. May I command ghosts and spirits, drive and tame tigers and leopards, ride upon rainbows and dragons. May the mountain spirits and the myriad demons all show reverence and awe, submitting to my discipline and receiving my protection. May all obstacles before me be obliterated, and may metal and stone yield.\n\nI further beseech the Perfected Ones and Divine Lords of the Five Peaks and renowned mountains to manifest and provide defense. May I achieve bodily division and transformation, attaining longevity and enduring vision.\n\nAgain, I perform nine bows, nine kowtows, and nine self-strikes. Having presented all this, any further private transgressions or hidden faults I may confess, seeking mercy and absolution, may be offered at will.\n\nWhen all has been spoken, I may modestly pour wine and present fine incense and fruits before the Perfected Kings, drinking the wine and performing nine bows each time.\n\nFirst, at the appointed hour, I invite one or two assistants to compound the elixir, keeping them thirty paces from the sacrificial site, their ears sealed with wax. If disciples compound the elixir with their master, those who are to ingest it together should also withdraw, though their ears need not be sealed.\n\nEach must receive the method separately and perform distinct rites; they should not combine them. After I have spoken and the necessities of food and drink are met, I command one or two persons to come and receive blessings. Once they have received the blessings, after a while, I send them back to their dwelling, and then proceed to send off the spirits.\n\nIf one bears the True Forms Chart of the Five Peaks, a separate seat should be set below for it, and it should be worshipped orally, without written prayers—omitting this if one does not possess it. The chart one wears should be placed upon the sacrificial mat.\n\nOn the previous day, one should also visualize the guardian spirits of the Five Peaks, commanding them to gather the local spirits, sweep and purify the mountains and rivers, ensuring no nursing tigers, birthing beasts, filth, or malevolent creatures remain within the precincts, in preparation for the descent of the Heavenly Perfected. Fixing one’s intent, one invokes the chart and calls one or two persons to receive blessings, unsealing their ears. After they receive the blessings and depart, their ears should not be resealed.\n\nWhen the sacrifice is complete, the spirits are sent off as dawn approaches. At the initial invocation, one should repeatedly beseech, entreating the Perfected Ones and Divine Lords for their grace. Upon completion, perform nine bows, nine kowtows, and nine self-strikes once more.\n\nOn the night of the sacrifice, there will surely be auspicious omens: the mountain trembling, the sound of thunder, clouds gathering, or a great mist enveloping the forest. These are signs of the descent of the numinous powers of Heaven and Earth upon the grand sacrifice—such manifestations are inevitable.\n\nHaving chosen an auspicious day for purification and elixir-compounding, one should seek a spacious cavern within a great cliff to accommodate all necessities. If no cavern is available, within a secluded area among the four mountains, amidst dense woods far from human habitation, construct a hut four or five *zhang* in length. Erect sturdy barriers and fences to shield against wind and rain, performing the sacrifice beneath the hut. If rain falls after the fire is lit, construct a temporary shelter to cover it, easily dismantled when the rain ceases.\n\nIn years of frequent rain, with high mountains and deep forests often shrouded in clouds, if labor is insufficient to build a rain shelter, one may simply remain within the cavern or hut—this is also suitable and free from concern about Heaven’s scrutiny.\n\nOne should also choose a site near water; without water, drawing and fetching become difficult. If near a mountain stream, where sacrifices are offered and the elixir is refined, have the disciples of one’s household widely disseminate warnings: travelers in the mountains should not approach the site where the *Taiqing Golden Liquor Divine Elixir Scripture* is kept—this is most proper. Only when needed should items from the altar be taken.\n\nThese preparations should be made before entering the mountain retreat. After seven days of purification, gather all required items and place them upon the altar, covering it with a crimson cloth nine *chi* in length. Burn incense, bow twice, and face the altar. At midnight, begin the sacrifice and use the items. Place the crimson cloth behind the sacrificial seat.\n\nOn that day, the host and assistants should prepare together, selecting fine incense to offer. The sacrificial food should not be shared with others; only those who join in the purification and elixir-compounding may partake as provisions. The quantity of raw and cooked offerings should be arranged thoughtfully, adjusted according to one’s means—purity is the sole requirement.\n\nIf disciples compound the elixir together, they should jointly prepare the sacrifice. The seating, cups, and plates should all be shared. The Six-One Mud may also be shared, but a large earthen crucible should be made. For every ten *jin* of cinnabar, five *jin* of realgar, and five *jin* of orpiment, one dose is prepared.\n\nWithin the earthen crucible, up to a hundred *jin* may be contained together, but the number of participants should not exceed three, as initially prescribed. The sacrificial provisions must then be abundant. If the offerings are too plentiful to be consumed, they may be prepared as dry rations for others, but these may only be distributed after the elixir is completed. Have the disciples in the household fast for three days before partaking. Those who have broken the fast need not be given the sacrificial food; they must fast again the following day.\n\nOn the *jiashen* day, kindle the fire beneath the crucible. If disciples compound the elixir together, each should observe the fast individually. During the fast, if one must leave to gather sacrificial items, they should bathe again upon returning, removing their garments to purify themselves. Even servants who are not participating should be restricted from entering or leaving, though they need not observe the fast. Select only those who are temperate, auspicious, and prudent, and have them also bathe and change their clothes.\n\nIf no true officials of the divine bureaucracy are present on the day of sacrifice, invoke the gods, officers, and soldiers from the talismanic registers to drive away tigers in lactation and impure beasts. If no register is available, employ the Six Jia Direct Talismans, following the division originally assigned, and constantly visualize them with focused intent.\n\nThe song goes:\nThe Golden Liquid and Elixir Blossom are celestial scriptures,\nIn the Grand Clarity, the immortals’ truth is surely clear.\nOnly with utmost sincerity may one undertake this,\nAnd through unceasing practice, longevity is assured.\n\nThe Six and One combine and require each other to form,\nFresh golden radiance enters the Flowery Pool.\nCalled the Golden Liquid that gives rise to feathered robes,\nIts thousand transformations and myriad changes are all fitting.\n\nThe Cloud-Blossom Dragon Ointment possesses eight mights,\nRepelling all spirits and *chimei* demons.\nWhen the essence enters the Vermilion Child, one soars aloft,\nAnd all offerings to the shrine remain undiminished.\n\nReceive my divine words and be welcomed,\nAs the Nine Elders and Nine Blacks support you.\nThe thousand-year crow and the drowned man perish,\nBut you may use this to seek life and perform exorcisms.\n\nThe Supreme Lightning of the Grand Loftiness will surely descend,\nWith the Mysterious Qi lingering for my use.\nSilken banners flutter and roll as they admonish,\nCommanding you to inscribe the unbroken line of gold and jade.\n\nDisrespect or haste will surely bring ruin,\nMock not the teachings of the divine words.\nReceive the scripture and wear it on your person—how could you set it aside?\nRiding the clouds in boundless freedom, ever as in a dream.\n\nThe yellow of the male and female nurtures the Three Offices,\nWhile the Mud-Pill Realized One overflows of itself.\nThe Crimson Palace’s Red Child rides the Dark Dragon,\nAnd the Lord of the Cinnabar Field ever flourishes.\n\nWhen the Three Spirits rejoice together, the body knows no end,\nLest the frost’s bloom ascend and penetrate.\nThe nine-hued vapors surge within the crucible,\nAs dark and yellow essences flow hidden in secluded groves.\n\nHarmonizing Yin and Yang, one may ascend or descend at will,\nSoaring to the Nine Heavens or sinking into the depths of the wilds.\nThe Elixir Blossom, light and yellow, must become gold,\nWhile mercury, lead, and tin are called the Sovereign of Chu.\n\nThe Old Woman of the Riverbank rides the divine dragon,\nAnd the essence of flowing pearls grants long years.\nThe Canopy’s divine water numbers in the billions,\nAs cloud-liquid leaps forth, forming frost and snow.\n\nEmbrace it and bow in reverence, visualizing the True King,\nFor hills become mountains, and Yang becomes the Elixir.\nThe child contains the essence of *zi* and *wu*, bright and mottled,\nThus using the Qi of the moon and the palace of the sun.\n\nIlluminating the night, ensuring eternal peace,\nHeaven and Earth vie to prolong your sojourn.\nTransmit this to those dear to me, free from calamity,\nFor without mutual aid, misfortune will extend.\n\nThe Dark Capital records sins as they are spoken,\nHow grievous the fate of parents in life and death!\nIf a son brings disaster upon his deceased father, it is incomplete,\nBut the sacrificial writ, once placed, is proclaimed in the thousandfold light.\n\nThe Mysterious Water, Jade Liquid, and Vermilion Crow appear,\nAnd though used all day, they are never exhausted.\nIn mountain forests and stone chambers, refine yourself,\nAnd reverse your white hair to a youth’s throat.\n\nThe Great Harmony arises naturally, and old age is unknown,\nAs the celestial drum resounds within your embrace.\nThe mountain within Heaven resembles the head and brain,\nWhere jade wine flows abundantly, sating all.\n\nSimply hold fast to this, and longevity is yours,\nFor a thousand years, one dose is the ultimate attainment.\nThe cinnabar script and jade vessel demand utmost reverence,\nAnd heeding my external instructions will already cure illness.\n\nHow much more will the divine scriptures extend life?\nMisfortune enters through the gate of leakage, fortune through secrecy.\nThe statutes bear heavenly prohibitions—do not suppress them,\nFor the radiant essence, dense and misty, transforms into immortals.\n\nA jade of linked cities grows ever more durable,\nAnd through this, long life need not be sought afar.\nIf you refuse to believe and plunge into the Nine Abysses,\nSecretly ponder the essentials and soar to the azure heavens.\n\nThis is the text of the *Taiqing Jinye Shendan Jing* (Scripture of the Grand Clarity’s Golden Liquid Divine Elixir), originally an ancient book beyond comprehension. Lord Yin rendered it in Han characters, totaling five hundred and four words.\n\n**Method for Making Six-One Mud:**\nTake equal parts of alum, halite, brine, and *yushi* (reputed stone), and fire them for twenty days. Then take left-facing oyster shells, red halloysite, and talc—seven ingredients in total, in equal parts—and adjust the quantity according to the size of the earthen crucible. Use this to coat the ears of the crucible, grinding it ten thousand times. Place it in an iron vessel and fire it intensely for nine days and nine nights until the medicine turns red. Grind it again ten thousand times, sift it finely, and mix it with pure, strong vinegar to form a mud, called Six-One Mud.\n\nTake two red earthen crucibles, sized according to need, and coat both the inner and outer surfaces with Six-One Mud to a thickness of three *fen*. Dry them in the sun for ten days until thoroughly desiccated. Then take nine *jin* of mercury and one *jin* of lead, place them in the earthen crucible, and apply intense fire from dawn until the hour of *ri xia bu*. The essences of mercury and lead will emerge together like yellow gold, called *xuanhuang* (Mysterious Yellow), also known as *feiqing* (Flying Light) or *feiliu* (Flying Flow).\n\nTake fine lead powder, fire it in an iron vessel until it turns golden, and combine it with *xuanhuang* in equal parts. Mix with *zuowei* (left-flavored substance) and grind ten thousand times until it becomes mud. Coat the inner and outer surfaces of the two crucibles, top and bottom, to a thickness of three *fen*. Dry them in the sun for ten days, ensuring they do not crack from dryness; apply mud by hand to protect them as needed.\n\nTake ten *jin* of refined cinnabar, five *jin* of realgar, and five *jin* of orpiment, grind them together, and sift finely. Adjust the quantity according to need—no less than five *jin* and no more than a hundred *jin*—and place it in the earthen crucible. Seal the seams with Six-One Mud to a thickness of one *fen* and dry in the sun for ten days. Then take finely sifted white tile shards, mix them with vinegar, one *jin* of realgar, and one *jin* of oyster shells, and grind them twenty thousand times until they form a mud.\n\nFurther reinforce the sealing mud on top, ensuring a thickness of three *fen*, and dry in the sun for ten days. If cracks appear upon heating, half of the divine essence will escape and fly away. Should fine cracks develop, apply Six-One Mud again to seal them. Inspect closely.\n\nFirst, place the crucible upon an iron *nao* and secure it. Then, using horse dung, burn the area five *cun* from the crucible’s sides for nine days and nine nights. If horse dung is unavailable, rice husks may be used instead. Next, apply fire to the base for nine days and nine nights. Then, encircle the crucible’s midsection with fire for another nine days and nine nights. In all, thirty-six days will complete the elixir.\n\nCool for one day, then open to inspect: the cinnabar should have ascended to the upper crucible, resembling shooting stars or the moon’s descent, its nine-colored clouds embroidered in splendor, like congealed frost or piled snow, its sword-like rays and emerald radiance unfolding in eight directions, its net-like brilliance swirling in abundance. Its vapor resembles purple blossoms illumined by the sun, its hue like azure skies reflecting rosy clouds, its layered towers and winding corridors resplendent with luxuriant beauty.\n\nSweep the elixir with the feathers of a three-year-old red male parrot, calling it the \"Flower of Golden Liquid.\" If the elixir fails to form, repeat the firing as before. Another thirty-six days—seventy-two in total—will leave no reason for failure. The key lies in regulating the fire with timely precision; uneven heat may complete the process in thirty-six days without need for refiring. If the crucible cracks, the spirit will depart, and consumption will yield no benefit. The sealing mud should protrude slightly by three *fen* for best results. Adjust the fire’s intensity as needed, gauging by intuition.\n\nAt dawn, bathe, fumigate your robes, and bow twice facing east. With heart fixed upon the celestial perfected and the lords divine, kneel and ingest the elixir in grains the size of millet or small beans. The superior adept ascends as an immortal in seven days, the middling in seventy, while the ignorant may require a year. If sincerity is absolute, the fastidiousness of the retreat flawless, and the dose three *dao-gui* measures, one may ascend as an immortal at once. Yet some Daoists, fearing imperfection, dare consume only three *dao-gui* to witness the divine elixir’s potent verification.\n\nUpon first taking three *dao-gui*, one will briefly die for half a day before reviving, as if awakening from sleep. Thereafter, resume consumption in millet-sized doses to discern the timeframe of one’s spiritual capacity. Should death occur within three days, administer a single grain of the elixir the size of a small bean by placing it in the mouth, and life will return instantly.\n\nTake one *zhu* of the divine elixir and cast it into a *jin* of mercury, then apply fire to transmute it into gold—though this gold is not for consumption. Instead, forge it into a tube to contain the elixir. Wrap the elixir in an embroidered pouch as recorded in the *Scripture of the Golden Liquid Divine Elixir*.\n\nFirst, prepare a strong, clear vinegar—weak vinegar is unusable. Once clarified to a volume of one *hu*, transfer it to a vessel and place it in a cool, clean location. Seal the vessel with mud, leaving a half-*cun* opening at the base. Weigh nine *liang* of gold with an ancient steelyard and immerse it in the vinegar for a hundred days to prepare it for mixing with Six-One Mud, calling it \"Golden Liquid.\" After twenty-one days in the brew, the gold will soften like dough, pliable at will, its essence dissolving into the liquid to form divine *qi*. To retrieve the gold after a hundred days, first grind three *liang* of *ling* stone into powder and mix it with three *dou* of cold water. Gradually extract the gold, then let it settle overnight to restore its original hardness.\n\nWhen first removing the gold from the vessel, do not stir it by hand, lest it soften and crumble. If gold is unavailable, it may be borrowed. For larger earthen crucibles, increase the vinegar volume beyond one *hu* proportionally, adjusting the gold’s weight accordingly.\n\nGrind cinnabar, realgar, and orpiment separately, sift through fine silk, and blend them before storing in a sealed vessel. Ensure the vessel’s mouth is as hot as fire.\n\nTake twenty *jin* of mica powder, grind it finely, and spread it on the ground where it may receive the sky’s light, leaving an opening in the center. Place ten *jin* of mulberry leaves from the *Scripture of the Golden Liquid Divine Elixir* (Volume One) atop the mica. At dusk, sprinkle three *dou* of clear water over the leaves. Once done, secretly remove the cinnabar, expose the vessel on the mulberry leaves, and uncover it. At dawn, return the cinnabar to its lid and store it indoors. Cover the mulberry leaves with a mat on the ground.\n\nRepeat this for seven days, beginning on an *jiazi* purification day and concluding at dawn on *xinwei*. Thus, the Yellow Dragon’s mica-infused liquid will fully enter the cinnabar, as if heavenly rain descends to bathe it. Guard the cinnabar diligently, lest insects or impurities defile it. Each evening, turn the cinnabar to expose it anew to the sky and sun. Once complete, grind it ten thousand times and seal it tightly.\n\nOn an *jiashen* day, place the mixture into the earthen crucible, ensuring the tube is level and unobstructed—do not press it by hand, for compression hinders ascent.\n\nFor the ritual of reception, prepare one *dou* and eight *sheng* of fine clear wine, one *jin* of thousand-year *chen* (agarwood), and three *shui-ren* (foxnut seeds), all prepared according to proper method.\n\nIf using this for refinement, take rice and ensure its purity. The rice may be steamed or boiled as preferred. Use three trays, each with three cups, and place the remainder in a separate tray for the altar. Light three censers of incense on either side, all sharing a single base, oriented toward the northwest. The master must purify himself for seven days or three days. After three days, perform the offering at the *zi* hour.\n\nDon fresh, clean garments, bow three times, and reverently invoke the Nine Celestial True Sovereigns, the Nine Elders of the Immortal Capital, the Nine Qi Venerable Ones, the Supreme True Persons, the True Officials of the Void Origin, the Jade Maidens of the Great Cinnabar, the Heavenly One Monarch, and the Central Yellow Lady. In all, the nine august true deities are entreated to descend into the chamber of so-and-so of such-and-such district and village.\n\nAgain bow three times, kowtow three times, and strike the breast three times, saying: *\"On this auspicious day of purification, I humbly welcome the Supreme Lords and Venerable Ones, beseeching your divine chariots to pause and rest but a moment.\"* Then offer incense and wine once more, bowing three times again.\n\nAfter a long while, kneel and say: *\"I, a flesh-born mortal, descendant of withered bones, long mired in ignorance and vulgarity, have accumulated sins and transgressions, my misfortunes and faults as weighty as mountains. I implore the Supreme Ones to dissolve the Three Worms and dispel the hundred calamities. Today, I pledge myself as a servant to the Supreme Dao Lord, ever contemplating purity to rectify this defiled body. By your grace, I have glimpsed the path of mystery. This very day, I receive the Golden Liquid Scripture from my late master Zhang, perusing its wondrous rites and awakening to rebirth. Thus do I know the sacredness of the Heavenly Worthy—how could such truths be uttered by worldly corpses, or grasped by one as dull as I? Dare I not guard this secret lightly? Therefore, I offer this sacrifice to the august celestial deities, entrusting this text to silk, transmitting it as sworn, and holding it close as the original method prescribes, to cherish it for years without divulgence. I only pray that the Supreme Great Dao and all Lords and Venerable Ones will aid this humble self, granting longevity and harmony in all endeavors, swiftly fulfilling my heart’s desires, hastening the completion of the divine elixir, and allowing me to retreat into the mountains. I further petition the exalted sovereigns above to assist in conjoining the essence of the elixir, adhering to the transmitted teachings, and reverently following the master’s instructions.\"*\n\nWhen finished, kowtow nine times and strike the breast nine times. Speak slowly and clearly; if unable to recite the original incantation, hold the scroll and read aloud. Offer incense and wine once more, then send off the deities. Rise, bow deeply, and say: *\"May the Nine Celestial True Kings be undisturbed.\"* Rise again, bow, and say: *\"May the Three Celestial True Sovereigns be undisturbed.\"*\n\n---\n\nBeyond this, it is said: the population numbers in the hundreds of thousands, with cities, palaces, and towers resembling those of Da Qin. The people are Hu in appearance, yet exceedingly fair, their attire and rituals marked by filial piety and reverence. They sit without squatting—even Tianzhu cannot compare. Some there follow the Great Dao.\n\nThis land spans twenty thousand *li* in each direction, cold and abundant in frost and snow. Ginger does not grow, so they rely on Tianzhu ginger. Lacking silkworms, they weave wool into fine fabrics. Dog and sheep wool may reach two or three *chi* in length, used by both men and women.\n\nAnxi lies eight thousand *li* west of Yuezhi. Its customs and terrain mirror Yuezhi’s, though its people and horses are fierce. The land spans five thousand *li*, where gold and jade are as common as stone, used as currency. When a king dies, new coins are minted. They have dogs, horses, and great birds.\n\nIts eastern territory is governed by over a hundred kings, each ruling independently, not subject to Yuezhi.\n\nYouqian lies seven thousand *li* southeast of Tianzhu. Its land and people resemble Tianzhu’s, yet its treasures and rarities surpass even Yuezhi’s. Thus do we know the vastness of heaven and earth, beyond mortal conjecture.\n\nThough these lands are distant, records of them exist; few know their boundaries. Da Qin and Yuezhi border Kunlun, southwest of the Rinan Sea. These are the greatest realms I have witnessed.\n\nFragrant substances vary in origin: *chen* and *fu* woods come from Rinan; *duliang* and *qingling* from Diansun; *jishe* and *fenluo* from Dubo; *youjian* and *ru* from Wulun; *qingmu* from Tianzhu; *yujin* from Zhubin; *suhe* from Anxi; *xunlu* from Da Qin. All derive from plants, each prized in its place—some as flowers, some as resins, some from hearts, some from branches. Only *jiaxiang*, conch shells, and the like arise from the depths of Geying and Juzhi. *Weiluo* from Yuezhi, sulfur from Dukun, *baifu* from Shihan, *guangbi* from Jiachen, orchids and mugwort in harmony, the subtle fragrances of Youqian—none surpass *zhentan*.\n\nHere ends the *Upper Scroll of the Scripture of the Divine Elixir of Golden Liquid from the Great Clarity*.\n*The Middle Scroll of the Scripture of the Divine Elixir of Golden Liquid from the Great Clarity* begins.\n\nThe Immortal Lord of Hidden Yin composed:\n\nThe Golden Liquid’s Reverted Cinnabar flows like immortal blossoms,\nSoaring high and roaming free to ascend the celestial mounds.\nThe yellow and red substances form in but a moment,\nYet their male and female essences scatter in wondrous disarray.\nThis can transform and summon the traveling kitchen,\nWhile spirit-people and jade maidens become my companions.\nMoving in and out without question, in harmony with Heaven’s tally,\nIts essence congeals like frost, adept at sinking and floating—\nYou must reverently await its visitation.\n\nThese sixty-three characters, originally obscure in ancient texts,\nWere revealed by Lord Yin to expound the Dao of the Golden Liquid’s Reverted Cinnabar.\n\nThe method employs a large copper cylinder,\nwith an opening two and a half inches wide,\nthe cylinder itself four-tenths of an inch thick and nine inches tall,\nusing two such cylinders.\nOne serves as a lid, five inches in height.\n\nPrepare one catty of refined *yushi* stone and half a catty of lead cinnabar.\nFirst, fire the *yushi* for twenty days,\nthen pound it ten thousand times.\nNext, place it in an iron vessel and subject it to fierce fire for nine days and nights,\nthen pound it again ten thousand times and sift it finely.\nMix it with pure bitter wine to a mud-like consistency,\nand coat the copper cylinder inside and out,\nensuring an even thickness of four-tenths of an inch—this is the first layer.\n\nFor the refinement method, repeat the process:\nTake the essence of realgar and orpiment,\nmix with pure wine, and coat both cylinders,\nmaking the layer half a tenth of an inch thick—this is the second layer.\n\nThe third layer is frost and snow.\nThe upper cylinder lid is coated in the same manner as the lower cylinder.\nFill the interior with frost and snow to a depth of one and a half inches,\nthen cover it with the upper cylinder lid.\nSeal the junction with red ochre and tile fragments,\ncoating it thoroughly to prevent leakage,\nfor if it leaks, the blossom essence will fly away.\nOnce sealed, coat it again,\nand place it in a clean, secluded spot to dry thoroughly.\nSet it in the center of a fire made of reed ash or horse dung,\nsecuring the cylinder firmly with an iron grate,\nelevated three inches from the ground.\nThe fire should be three inches from the cylinder on all sides—\nthis must be carefully and precisely observed.\n\nAfter ten days, move the fire two inches closer on all sides.\nAfter twenty days, move it one inch closer.\nBy the thirtieth day, the fire should surround the cylinder on all sides,\nreaching halfway up its height.\nAfter fifty days, it is called \"yellow gold.\"\nThis yellow gold is the divine medicine within,\ncapable of forming true gold.\n\nAfter another twenty days of firing, totaling seventy days,\nthe medicine is complete and named \"red gold.\"\nThis red gold is the divine medicine that can form true red gold,\ncalled the Golden Liquid’s Reverted Cinnabar.\n\nTo make yellow gold,\ntake one *zhū* of reverted cinnabar and place it in a catty of lead—\ntrue gold will form.\nAlternatively, first melt the lead in a vessel,\nthen add a *daogui* of the red medicine while observing.\nFive-colored radiance and purple clouds will swirl in lush brilliance,\nshifting between dark and yellow like celestial clouds—\nthis is called \"purple gold,\" the marvel of the Dao.\n\nThe purple frost on the lid is called \"divine cinnabar.\"\nFor consumption, blend it with dragon’s fat gloss and jujube paste,\nforming pills the size of soybeans.\nTake one pill at dawn with well-water,\nincreasing to one pill daily.\nAfter seventy days,\nthe Six Ding and Six Jia spirit-immortals and jade maidens will attend you,\nguiding and escorting you front and back.\nAfter a hundred days,\nyou will wander in rapture, moving freely through time and space.\nAfter a hundred and fifty days,\njade maidens will serve you day and night,\nyour form transformed to the hue of true jade,\ngaining mastery over transformation and freedom.\nYou will constantly receive massages and summon treasures for the traveling kitchen.\n\nGold governs the flesh and muscles,\nwhile reverted cinnabar governs the blood and meridians,\nenabling the spirit to ascend and descend without limit,\nmoving in and out without hindrance,\nand meeting the celestial spirits of the sun and moon.\nEach morning, rinse your mouth with the Jade Pond’s nectar,\nkeeping it ever full and overflowing.\nThe jade nectar is the fluid in the mouth,\ngoverning bones, marrow, sinews, and flesh,\nenhancing one’s essence and qi to rise,\nbanishing fatigue and weariness,\nbestowing longevity and enduring vision.\n\nDragon’s fat gloss is the dew on mulberry leaves.\nAt dawn, gently wipe the dew from the leaves with silk,\nboil it with large dried jujubes,\nand blend the clear juice with equal parts sheep marrow,\nsimmering it into a jujube paste.\nThis can also be taken long-term,\nfilling the body and enhancing one’s complexion.\n\nThe copper cylinder can also be made larger.\nThe dimensions described earlier suffice for one dose of reverted cinnabar—\nadjustments may be made as needed.\n\n**Method for Making Jujube Paste:**\nFor one dose, use three *dǒu* of large dried jujubes and six *dǒu* of water,\nboiling until the jujubes are soft.\nAdd another three *dǒu* of water and boil again.\nIn total, use nine *dǒu* of water,\nthen strain the liquid and let it settle,\nyielding three *dǒu* of clear juice.\nAdd six *dǒu* of sheep marrow to the juice and simmer gently\nuntil it reaches the consistency of malt sugar.\nIf sheep marrow is unavailable, sheep fat may be used instead.\n\n**Method for Extracting the Essence of Realgar and Orpiment:**\nTake one catty each of realgar and orpiment,\npound them finely ten thousand times,\nand sift thoroughly.\nUse Six-One Mud to seal an earthen crucible,\nplacing the powders inside and sealing the top.\nThen take newly fired tile fragments,\nmix them with mud, and seal the crucible to prevent qi leakage.\nDry it in the sun until it cracks, then seal it again.\nNext, use reed firewood to burn the crucible’s base and sides\nfor three days and nights.\nIf the essence rises like frost and snow, it is ready.\nFor larger cylinders, the frost and snow from the crucible lid may also be used.\n\n**Method for Making Frost and Snow:**\nTake equal parts *cengqing*, *yushi*, sulfur, halite, *ningshuishi*, red ochre, and mercury,\npound them together ten thousand times without sifting.\nMix with pure wine until moist and pliable.\nPlace in an earthen crucible and seal with mud,\nfollowing the same method as for the divine cinnabar’s earthen crucible.\n\nAgain apply red ochre and white tile fragments to seal and secure it, ensuring no leakage—every step must match the previous sealing without deviation. Burn with reed firewood beneath and around it for four days and four nights, slightly intensifying the heat. When the divine essence rises like frost and snow, use the feather of a three-year-old male parrot to sweep it off, calling it *Frost and Snow*. You may add three more ingredients—cinnabar, realgar, and orpiment—combining them in equal parts with the previous seven to make ten in total, naming it *Golden Essence Congealed Frost and Snow*. Thus is the Way of the Returning Elixir complete.\n\nThe Returning Elixir will not form without prior ritual offering. Fast for three days, then present five *dou* of clear wine and ten *jin* of white dried meat to sacrifice to the Spirit of the Great Turtle. As for the copper cylinder, reeds are used because the Celestial Steed’s essence demands them. The fire must be kindled with horse dung, though reed fire is difficult to manage. When refining the essence of realgar and orpiment, or when burning *Frost and Snow*, reed fire is appropriate—unlike the fire used for the copper cylinder.\n\n*Golden Essence Congealed Frost* may be ingested to grant immortality, but it is not the same as *Frost and Snow*, which is unsuitable for placement inside the copper cylinder. The ingredients for *Frost and Snow*—*cengqing*, halite, and *ningshuishi*—are all precious medicines and cannot be substituted. Without genuine materials, the medicine will not form.\n\nThe *Divine Elixir of Golden Liquid from the Great Clarity* comprises five hundred seventy-six characters in lines of seven. The *Golden Liquid* section contains five hundred four characters, and the *Returning Elixir* sixty-three. Master Zheng says: The transformations of immortals—whether ascending or descending—are difficult to discuss in terms of mundane verification. Truly, they are not attainable by ordinary means. The divine transformations recorded in the alchemical classics are grounded in empirical proof, which is why the Celestial Worthies have concealed this Way. The two truths of the real and the apparent are inseparable, yet the foolish do not reflect and thus perceive it as distant. The enlightened, however, can grasp it in an instant, so the texts are kept secret only from those who fail to comprehend. How could such wisdom be debated in scriptures?\n\nWithout a sincere aspiration for immortality, the teachings are not transmitted. Thus, the Lady of Supreme Perfection once told Master Ma: \"Even after accompanying Anqi for a short time, his methods could be passed down. But those who seek shallow or hasty results will find the gates tightly sealed. Even true immortals guard their treasures so closely—how could such knowledge befit the unworthy?\" Lord Yin, skilled in writing, sealed his texts and entrusted them to the Five Peaks. If a devotee of the Dao retreats into the mountains, refines their essence, and reveres the highest flavors, those who persist in the Way will find the immortals themselves parting the stone cliffs to reveal their secrets. Without progressing step by step in the pursuit of the Dao, the secret essentials of the alchemical classics will remain forever hidden in the towering peaks.\n\nMasters Ma and Yin were not merely immortals. They observed the celestial patterns, foretold the rise and fall of nations, discerned the waxing and waning of destinies, and verified what was yet to come. Their boundless compassion nurtured all living beings, and their profound knowledge established the names of all things. Aligning with the sagely and illuminating the myriad beings, they were truly radiant—truly divine.\n\nIn the past, I heard from true immortals who transmitted these teachings, and their words were filled with admiration. Their instructions on actual refinement were consistent across different masters—how could the pure and true teachings be allowed to fade without being recorded? Thus, I have written down the divine insights of these two masters, along with the accounts passed down since the reign of Emperor Ling of Han, and appended them to the alchemical classics. May those who walk the Dao draw inspiration from them.\n\nDisciple Ge Hong says: In the first year of *Taixing* of the Jin, the year *wuyin*, on the sixth day of the tenth month, former Prefect of Nanhai, Bao Shuo, told me: \"On the twenty-second day of the eighth month of that year, while traveling in the capital, I was returning to the river when, riding a horse, I encountered a youth of sixteen or seventeen, fair of face, on the northern road of Jiangshan in Jiankang. We walked together for several *li*. I have studied the Dao, observed celestial signs, and am versed in various arts. I saw this person walking slowly yet moving swiftly.\n\nGe Hong, still mounted, spurred his horse to a gallop, yet could only just keep pace—gradually, the youth pulled ahead. Marveling at his extraordinary swiftness, Ge asked: \"Where are you bound, that you travel so swiftly? Though your steps seem unhurried, you move with such speed. You must be one who walks the Dao.\"\n\nThe youth halted and replied: \"I am the transcendent Yin Changsheng, sent by the Most High to the Red City. You appear to have a seeking heart, which is why you have encountered me.\"\n\nGe Hong, well-versed in Daoist scriptures, knew of old that Lord Yin had attained transcendence—this must be he. He dismounted at once, bowed deeply, and exchanged courtesies, though he had no time to speak further.\n\nLord Yin said: \"This place will see, in ten years’ time, great turmoil and war, with blood soaking the fields. Why do you seek life here?\"\n\nAfter some time in conversation, they parted. Lord Yin told Bao Shuo: \"Though you have long yearned for the Dao, your refinement has only just begun, and your years are already advanced. Yet if you strive as a master craftsman, I foresee you may still attain deliverance from the world. The highest method of transcendence for those who attain the Dao in old age is *corpse-liberation*. The superior form uses a blade, the inferior, bamboo or wood.\"\n\nBao Shuo asked: \"In corpse-liberation with a blade—does the blade harm the body?\"\n\nLord Yin replied: \"Not as you imagine. When we speak of blade corpse-liberation, the blade stands in for the person, placed in the coffin to satisfy the emotions of descendants and sever worldly ties. With the *Mysterious Yin Birth Talisman* of the Most High, one inscribes the blade’s edge on both sides, using divine elixir as ink. In an instant, the inscription forms a likeness of the person—face and features as they were—who then dies upon the bed. The true self departs at once, never to return home. The family, believing the blade to be the body, mourns for a morning and buries it. The inferior form, using bamboo or wood, follows the same method of inscribing talismans with divine elixir.\"\n\nHaving imparted these talismanic writings to Bao Shuo, Lord Yin’s words came to an end. He lingered a while, then vanished without a trace. Looking up toward the mountains and marshes, Bao saw only a flock of cranes rising from the grass—several in number—soaring southeast, disappearing over the peaks into the clouds, never to be seen again.\n\nLater, discussing the rise and fall of the Jin, he told Bao Shuo: \"After this *jiashen* year, in the *yiyou* and *bingxu* years, two rulers will pass, and rebels will fill the land. When misfortune reaches its nadir, the dynasty will nearly collapse, leaving but one in ten thousand. If you cultivate the arts of the Huai and Si rivers, first securing a strategic stronghold—occupying the region north of Weiyang and west of Beihai—you will align above with the Dipper’s measure and below with earthly *qi*. From this time onward, beginning with the lands south of the Yangtze, the dynasty may endure sixty-six years, until the *jiaxu* period, when its mandate will end. From the struggles at the capital’s gates to the *jiashen* year, the span is fixed. Calamity hastens ruin; blessings and exorcisms may prolong it, but when the breath of destiny is exhausted, all will converge in that year. From now to *jiashen*, precisely seventy-six years remain.\n\nThe mandate of emperors is decreed by Heaven. Your line will see ten generations before its end. The Xia’s Shaokang, the Shang’s Gaozong, the Zhou’s Pingwang, and the Han’s Guangwu—all serve as precedents. Each followed Heaven’s measure. By this reckoning, the Jin’s mandate should also span ten generations, and indeed, it may yet prevail, for I have spoken of this before the celestial courts.\n\nNow, a ghostly lawsuit has arisen: Emperor Wen of Jin’s bloodshed has been unceasing, and his grievance has reached the Heavenly Bureau. If the Most High adjudicates the wrong, the Jin may yet preserve its lineage. If the Most High dispels the ghost and entrusts the mandate to another, then from Emperor Wu onward—skipping Emperors Hui and Min—the dynasty will still endure ten generations.\n\nThe Jin’s fate now rests in the celestial courts, much like the case of Zhao Jianzi long ago. The ghost of Emperor Wen continues his suit even now. Once, Zhao Jianzi dreamed of Dukes Yin and Xian, following them to the court of the Heavenly Emperor. The two dukes argued their case before the Emperor, and Jianzi, unable to prevail, was handed over to them. Duke Yin seized Jianzi’s head, while Duke Xian raised his sword to strike. Jianzi’s head fell to the ground, but he retrieved it and reattached it—though not quite right. A shaman from Cenyang, standing beside the Heavenly Emperor, saw this and helped adjust it.\n\nAwakening displeased, Jianzi went out walking. On the road, he met a man leading a white dog. The man stepped aside into a thicket of brambles, where the dog’s leash tangled in the thorns. The shaman turned back to free it, but the thorns clung to the dog’s head, preventing its escape. The shaman glanced at Jianzi, who recognized him—his clothing and face were just as in the dream.\n\nJianzi asked: 'I feel I have met you before. Where did we see each other?'\n\nThe man replied: 'I am the shaman of Cenyang. Yesterday, I stood before the Heavenly Emperor and saw the two dukes accuse you. You argued your case but could not prevail, and the Emperor handed you over to them. Duke Yin seized your head, Duke Xian drew his sword, and your head fell to the ground. You retrieved it and reattached it, but it was not quite right—so I helped adjust it. We met just yesterday, and today you have forgotten?'\n\nJianzi said: 'So it was. What can be done now? Can I still act to change this?'\n\nThe shaman replied: 'It cannot be done. Your fate has already been severed above; it cannot be restored.'\n\nJianzi said: 'But you helped me reattach my head yesterday. Surely there is some way to aid me? Now that we have met by chance, it must be a sign of fortune. I beg you to deliver me.'\n\nThe shaman whistled for a long while, then said: 'Very well.'\"\n\nNow beholding the realm, those who have turned their backs on the Son of Heaven of Zhou—none surpass Qi in severity, and the Heavenly Emperor’s wrath against Qi is likewise most severe. You, Great King, may represent the Son of Heaven, petition for troops to punish Qi, and the Heavenly Emperor will surely rejoice. He will extend your fate, granting you twenty-five more years. This alone remains as a means to prolong your life.”\n\nJianzi, overjoyed at these words, promptly returned to memorialize the Son of Heaven and request troops to punish Qi. The Son of Heaven assented and dispatched forces with Zhao to attack Qi. Jianzi, acting on the Son of Heaven’s mandate, commanded the feudal lords to join the expedition, assembling at the Yellow River to offer sacrifices to the River God. Jianzi knelt in reverence, striking his chest with both hands, and prayed: “By the mandate of Heaven today, I execute the traitorous and punish the guilty, achieving my aim against Qi.” Jianzi then journeyed to Zhao and served the River God with devotion. The campaign indeed crushed Qi, and Qi once more offered tribute to the Son of Heaven. Thus, Jianzi gained an extension of twenty-five years to his life. Such is the way of mending what is severed through merit and virtue.\n\nThe words of the Lord of the Netherworld were as clear as this. Later, in the second year of *Taining* (324 CE), the year *jiashen*, the rebellion of the great general Wang Dun indeed erupted. By the third year, *yiyou* (325 CE), on the twenty-fourth day of the second month, Emperor Yuan passed away. In the fourth year, *bingxu* (326 CE), Emperor Ming followed. In the third year of *Xianhe* (328 CE), Su Jun led a horde of one hundred thousand bandits northward to ascend Mount Jiang. The very places where the Lord of the Netherworld had traversed all became bandit encampments. The span, indeed, amounted to ten years.\n\nThe Bao clan, admiring Hong’s reverence for the Dao’s savor and his prudence in speech, shared these words with him, strictly enjoining him to commit them to memory and never divulge them. Even among his own disciples and kin, none were privy to this knowledge. He guarded it in utmost secrecy, sealing his lips. The Lord of the Netherworld told Bao: \"You are trusted by the age; you may also make the present sovereign aware of the world’s turning fortunes. If he secures his embattled lands, he may yet preserve and protect, though wounded, he shall not fall. This, too, is a boon of ruler and minister’s merit. You must act on your own. You harbor the art of divining omens and portents—use it to know, but do not speak of having discussed these matters with me. Moreover, you must extol virtue to the times, making affairs subtle yet manifest, principles hidden yet discernible. Do not be blunt and unguarded, lest you compound others’ calamities and transgressions.\"\n\nThat year, Bao submitted a memorial to Emperor Yuan, expounding the essentials of the dynasty’s rise and fall, the dynamics of suppression and prevention. His memorial wove together astrological prognostication and the import of ancient and modern times—all drawn from the Lord of the Netherworld’s words. Yet where it spoke of opportunities lengthening and eras stretching far, this was Bao’s own embellishment, not the original substance of the Lord’s discourse. The memorial contained other matters, which Emperor Yuan kept secret. Still, he privately noted the vast span of years described and suspected Bao of excess. He once discreetly showed the memorial to Minister of State Wang Dao, who remarked: \"This is turning hundreds into thousands. You ever loathe the near and delight in the distant, shun the short and praise the long. Even in a minister’s words, though free of concealment or flattery, one should not strike the heart so directly. It is like medicine to cure illness: one must first divide the dose to remedy distress. If one were to take the whole draught at once in haste, the ears could not bear the trial, and the condition would surely worsen.\"\n\nEmperor Yuan fell silent. Hong once glimpsed Bao’s memorial in passing but had no time to read it. He copied down its words, which bore strong evidence. Only those keen to subtle signs could grasp the depth of its purport. Of late, with spies proliferating within and without, the search for this text proved futile—perhaps lost to banditry and palace fires. Hong wished to see this memorial again, not for its purport, but to know the appointed time of peace or ruin, for he prized the Lord of the Netherworld’s parting words.\n\nThe Lord of the Netherworld had long departed, yet later appeared in person to Bao. His discourse was subtle and wondrous, his profound insight clear as a mirror; thus, it is recounted here. After Bao’s death, he was temporarily interred at Shizigang. When bandits raided and opened his tomb, they found only a single broadsword in the coffin, with no trace of clothing or bones. The bandits also heard the sounds of men and horses around the tomb, and in terror, they fled, leaving the sword untouched. Later, Bao’s family reburied him, interring only the great sword. Thus, Bao must have attained the Lord of the Netherworld’s method of *daoshi* through the sword. Perhaps he sought the Dao and its scriptures.\n\nHere ends the middle scroll of *The Divine Elixir of Golden Liquor*.\nHere begins the lower scroll of *The Divine Elixir of Golden Liquor*.\n*Preface and Account by Baopuzi*\n\nGe Hong says: I have seen those who compile accounts of the South’s similarities and differences, recording the strange life of foreign lands. Though their works roughly approximate the truth, their travels have been too shallow to properly discern the marvels of distant regions or inscribe the wonders of exotic lands for our eyes. Thus, I have expanded upon their records, allowing their scattered observations to be measured and their broad visions to be clarified. I have documented their named domains so that north and south may be precisely distinguished, and east and west no longer confused.\n\nYet since the primordial chaos divided and the Two Modes split apart, beneath the heavens’ canopy and upon the earth’s expanse, within the Four Seas and beyond the Eight Wastes, the vastness stretches so far that none can fathom its bounds. All that yin and yang mold, all that sun and moon illuminate—from the verdant growth of plain matter to the crawling of gnats and wriggling of worms—abound in such multitude that none can enumerate them in full.\n\nIn ancient times, Yu governed the floods for thirteen years, traversing the Nine Provinces, summoning the remote and essential, and only then distinguishing their directions and examining their records for discrepancies. Yet even what his feet trod and his eyes beheld was but a fraction. Of all that the dark and yellow encompass, of all that the Six Directions contain, he could grasp no more than one percent.\n\nMoreover, the *Book of Zou Yang* states: \"The present Nine Provinces are not the world’s true provinces, but merely one of nine. Within the Four Extremes, there are eight more.\" Scholars of this age dismiss this as empty talk. In my youth, I aspired to study the Dao and journey beyond the distant. Once, during a brief respite, I traveled south on a journey. Initially, I thought only to observe Jiaoling. Taking advantage of an opportunity, I reached Funan.\n\nFunan spans over a thousand *li*, its populace numbering in the hundreds of millions. It embraces mountains and borders the sea, its borders vast and remote. I assumed it to be the southernmost land, the limit of the world. Yet when the summer months arrived in the Central Realm and the balmy winds stirred, there came those from even farther south, arriving like rivers flowing. I inquired about their lands and examined their customs. They spoke of great nations like Funan—ten or more—extending from Tianzhu and Yuezhi. Beyond the lands of Dainan and Fulin, each spans thirty thousand *li*. Among them, smaller states lie scattered in countless numbers. Though their names and locations have origins and ends, their peoples and customs differ so widely that one realizes how vast the world truly is. Even sages and worthies, though they set their minds on distant travels, cannot exhaust its wonders—how much less can vulgar scholars, who doubt without cause? As for Zouzi’s claim, it is not mere exaggeration.\n\nYet what I have heard suggests that these lands alone surpass the Nine Provinces tenfold. As for what is merely rumored and not yet verified, how can their extent be measured? The expanse is boundless, its limits unknown—how can one arbitrarily fix their number at eight? The ancient sages took the Divine Continent of China and matched the Nine Provinces to the Eight Trigrams. Above, they aligned with the celestial pole; below, they centered the earth’s core. Thus, the Nine Provinces are here. The rest, though vast, are not part of this scheme.\n\nAs for their strange mountains and wondrous seas, their bizarre creatures and exotic species, their rare treasures and splendid objects—so dazzling and extraordinary that they fill the eyes and ears, startling the heart and shocking the mind—what I have seen but never heard of is too strange and irregular to be fully recorded. These are mere extravagances for external display, not what one seeking life’s cultivation should pursue.\n\nFrom Funan and Dunxun to Linyi, Dubo, and Wulun—within these five lands—are found cinnabar, sulfur, azurite, quartz, and the minerals from which elixirs for transcendent ingestion and medicines for longevity are derived. The stones that preserve life are sought without fail, yet I cannot enumerate them all by name. There, cinnabar is as common as tiles in the east, and red mercury lies underfoot like potter’s clay. Paired fish cover the ground in such abundance that none can measure it.\n\nYet these five lands do not know the methods of ingestion or the path to prolonged life. They value useless trinkets to fill their realms, abandoning divine stones without refinement. They compete for carved and polished goods, scorning the medicines of flowing cinnabar. They do not refine or consume them, leaving their true essence to endure for eons, mixed and unrefined, their wondrous properties unmanifested. What I have witnessed and verified is indeed clear.\n\nNow, in my sixtieth year, though I still chew herbs and woods, I know that only the efficacy of elixirs is essential. Yet time slips away, and contentment remains elusive. Death looms ever closer. A petty county’s rank—how could I covet such honor? My refusal to decline this post is but to harness the people’s strength and seek a path forward. I intend to linger in the cinnabar fields and cultivate the hidden arts. This long-held aspiration and humble wish have now converged. I bid farewell to the grave mounds—I shall depart.\n\nThose who study the Dao and seek life are often poor scholars. The wealthy, indulging in fine foods and ease, are ensnared by sensual pleasures. To humble themselves, curb desires, and abandon passions for joy—how few can endure the toil and humiliation of seeking a master, bearing hardship and suffering? Not one in a thousand. Moreover, those who wish to cultivate immortality cannot ascend without elixirs.\n\nI was born in Yangzhou, and poverty has followed me. The eight minerals are prized, yet I have no means to obtain them. To demand them unjustly is unheard of; to rely on hired labor is impractical. My constitution has long been weak and frail. If I were to undertake this, my heart would be burdened. Even if I were granted a prefecture, I could never gather the necessary resources. Thus, the Dao often clings to poverty, while wealth pursues nobility.\n\nFurthermore, the world’s troubles remain unresolved. Heat and cold afflict my heart. I did not foresee fate’s decree or the descent of calamity. With turmoil rising, I glance at my limbs and constantly fear the blade’s edge. Trembling in dread, how could I find time to seek medicines and nurture my life?\n\nNow, though I hold these elixir scriptures, I have no means to apply them. It is like offering a dragon’s abyss sword in a butcher’s shop or adorning a dog with luminous pearls. One values the substance but does not know how to employ it—is this not lamentable? I shall now explain these truths to my disciples; let them all heed them.\n\nA person parched with great thirst forever longs to stand by the long river. One ravenous with hunger yearns to dwell in farm and garden. For those who wish to study the Dao, why not embrace the sacred formulas and wander their lands—what worry then for the scarcity of cinnabar and minerals? Is it that the mind’s strength is not gathered? Why then halt in lands of noble strife, settling the body in realms of contention, sharing in their exhaustion?\n\nFew know me, thus what I possess is precious. It is fitting to distance oneself from human affairs and avoid the inner chambers, to sever the clamor and tread the cinnabar mounds. When zithers and lutes play among the horses’ bridles, how can one discern their proper tones? Those who do not value the arts of elixirs do not value what I undertake. Thus, I may secure what I cultivate, my heart free from ceaseless dread, cherishing what I savor without toil or deference. Is this not to fulfill principle within while appearing foolish without?\n\nMoreover, in the vast southern reaches, famed mountains stretch unbroken. Below, hidden caverns mirror the depths of Mount Huo; above, their peaks rival the azure clouds. Fire-states blaze fiercely, fragrant arrays perfume the air—are the blessed lands solely confined to the outskirts of Yang and Chu? Yet the south extends beyond the Four Seas, and the sages of old who recorded the names of mountains inscribed only what lay within their domains, omitting what lay beyond.\n\nThe elixir scriptures speak of attainment and ingestion, of the proof of ascension to heaven, as the immortals’ traditions of the Eight Distant Realms describe—a mere household’s courtyard. Yet these five lands are all within reach of human travel; how can they be deemed remote? Thus, I do not disdain their distance but yearn for their realms, nor shrink from their remoteness but resolve to reach their lands.\n\nShould heaven’s decree not extend my years and the elixir remain unperfected, I shall reckon by fate’s portion and cultivate the numinous arts. By abiding in principle, I may summon flying frost and radiant splendor, dark clouds rising on all sides—this too is diligent service, and heaven may yet aid me.\n\nLife knows no noble or base; each must face death. To dispel the Three Corpses, guard essence and preserve qi, restrain the hun and nurture the spirit, to seek the numinous savor—if life cannot be attained, then at least one does not lose the common fate of death. It is like the many who cast lines and hooks, scattering bait across broad waters to catch fish—who can know who will strike first? Or like a thousand hounds chasing a hare, where only some will seize it. Thus, the end of fate’s span is even what emperors cannot evade.\n\nNow, let me measure by fate’s portion and align with the expected gains and losses. To be reduced to ashes on the long road, I accept it as sweetly as water-chestnut greens. For I hold fast to the Dao with sincerity, my cinnabar heart steadfast within. Though Su Qin and Zhang Yi were to reappear, Chen Ping and Li Yiji to revive, and they sought to persuade me with schemes, seizing the moment—exalting glory and splendor as foremost, their eloquence lush and ornate, their words cascading—still, I would flare with indignation, towering above those two, not deigning even to smile. With a single word, I would break them. My heart is like bedrock, unshaken by you; my resolve is adamantine, unsevered by you. My essential words are spent.\n\nOne with such resolve and sentiment may yet move the myriad spirits to pity, and perhaps I shall attain the transformation of the cicada’s molt. After a hundred years or more, I may turn to look back, my face restored to youth, to show the unbelievers. Yet I fear that by then, the skeptics will have long since crumbled to dust, no longer able to dispute what I once declared. These words may seem laughable—yet perhaps they are not.\n\nNow, I record the lands of life-elixirs, chronicling the outer realms, and append my foolish thoughts to the *Golden Liquid*. If these treasures remain hidden in secrecy, my words shall endure. Thus, the fox’s den beneath the royal city goes unassailed, the field mouse clinging to the temple wall remains undug, like the mosquito riding the swan to soar the dark peaks.\n\nHere, I bind my meager words to the true scriptures, seeking to preserve them. Let my disciples broaden their seeing and hearing. The words of Wan of Pu may be chosen even in the grand ancestral temple; the aspirations of a madman may yet align with the times. A general’s command may be overturned, but the will of a common man cannot be defied.\n\nI bow twice before the vermilion gates and take eternal leave. My back turns to the pines of the grave mounds, my heart conceals itself from the vulgar. People cannot understand me, nor can I understand them. Facing a wall without self-awareness—after the fish and turtles have had their fill, is this not pitiable? People see me as mad; I see them as insects. To whom can I declare the workings of fate’s measure?\n\nLet future gentlemen each seek their own virtue and deeds, not distinguishing intent by mere peepholes. My journey proceeds slowly; I set my boat upon the vast river. Departing from Xianglin, I turn toward the Winnowing Basket and away from the Celestial Sieve, riding the wind and following the current, swift as lightning or shooting stars. Day and night, I do not pause; the days accumulate, doubling into ten-day spans. At last, I reach Funan, where kings and lords rule, its lands vast, spanning ten thousand li as its borders. To the north, it borders Linyi; to the south, it encloses Dianxun. To the left, it draws Du Bo; to the right, it meets Wu Lun. Its people and things are countless, their gatherings like clouds. Suddenly, I find myself in a boundless expanse, a frontier without end, as if at the very edge of heaven. In these cinnabar caves, by the mid-summer month, when the moon’s cycle is at its guest, the triumphant winds blow northward, and the southern travelers arrive. With no means to ask of their origins, each clings to their homeland.\n\nI call this the southernmost pole, the far edge of the northern lands. When I inquire of the number of their states, they speak of Wuyuan, Gouzhi, Geying, Linyang, Jiachen, Shihan, Huli, Sidiao, Da Qin, Gunu, Chalao, Qibo, Zhinbin, Tianzhu, Yuezhi, Anxi, and Youqian—great lands numbering in the tens of thousands, smaller realms in the thousands. Beyond these, their roots are unknown.\n\nXianglin is today’s southern county. Long ago, Ma Yuan opened the southern frontier for the Han, establishing Xianglin County. Beyond Rinan by four or five hundred li, he erected two bronze pillars to mark the Han’s southern border. When the Later Han declined, foreign tribes invaded from without, seizing Xianglin and its bronze pillars. Now, they lie by the sea, some three hundred li south of Linyi, and have become the separate kingdom of Xitu. Its lands abound with cinnabar like dust.\n\nDeparting from Shouling浦 in Rinan, sailing due south across the sea, one thus turns one’s back to the Chen star and faces the Ji star. Sailing day and night without cease for over ten days, one reaches Funan. Funan lies over three thousand li southwest of Linyi. It established itself as a kingdom, and all its tributary states acknowledge its ruler. The king of the greatest state is titled *paodao*, while the kings of lesser states are titled *positan*. The chieftains and the king’s chief ministers are all called *Kunlun*. Funan’s lands abound with cinnabar and precious stones. From Funan north to Linyi is three thousand li, a region rich and fertile, with plentiful cinnabar, realgar, and sulfur. Dianxun lies four or five thousand li south of Funan and was originally a separate kingdom. Fan Tan, a former king of Funan, subdued it through valor and strategy, and it now belongs to Funan. Its lands produce iron. To its south lie the kingdoms of Dukun, Bisong, and Gouzhi, all of which Fan Tan conquered in his campaigns—hence the name *Han Dianxun*. Dianxun is twenty thousand li from Rinan, while Funan is seemingly no more than three thousand seven or eight hundred li from Linyi. How is this known? When ships depart from the mouth of Shouling浦, with favorable winds they sail day and night without furling their sails for fifteen days before reaching Dianxun. In a single day and night, they cover two thousand li.\n\nOne may ask: \"Today, the towering junks of the Yangtze, with their broad sails, drift downstream with the current and a following wind, yet travel no more than three hundred li in a day. You now speak of sea voyages covering three thousand li day and night—is this not an exaggeration?\" I reply: \"In the past, I repeatedly questioned sailors about this. When their ships hoist four sails, forming a canopy like clouds, and catch the wind, they test their speed by casting an object into the water. In the time it takes to inhale and exhale once, the object has passed a hundred paces. Reasoning from this, their speed surpasses that of a galloping deer, and even the swiftest horse—said to cover a thousand li—cannot match it. Thus, I conclude they travel roughly a thousand li or so.\" That land yields cinnabar, azurite, sulfur, and purple and white quartz.\n\nDuboge and Poluo are kingdom names. They lie on an island in the Eastern Swelling Sea, due east of Funan. Sailing directly across the sea from Funan takes several dozen days to reach them. Their lands are populous, with cultivated rice fields. Women weave white *diedie* floral cloth, and both men and women wear white clothing. The land is rich in gold, tin, iron, and cinnabar, as common as dust. They use gold as currency and produce multicolored parrots, pigs, deer, domesticated water buffalo, large sheep, chickens, and ducks. They have no rhinoceroses, elephants, tigers, or leopards. The people are gentle and prudent, with customs resembling those of Guangzhou.\n\nWulun lies over two thousand li west of Funan. It is a large kingdom where coconut palms and various fruit trees grow on both sides of the roads. Their shade provides cool relief from the heat. Pavilions stand every ten li or so, each with a well. The people eat water caltrop rice and drink grape wine. The fruit is as viscous as glue, and when mixed with water, the wine becomes sweet and delicious. The people of this land often enjoy long lives, some reaching two hundred years.\n\nGouzhi lies eight hundred li from Dianxun. A river there flows southwest, then turns northeast before emptying into the sea. Far offshore, a great promontory juts into the sea, where the waters are shallow and rich in lodestone. Foreign merchants’ ships are clad in iron plates, but upon reaching this promontory, they are trapped by the lodestone and cannot pass. They must stop at Gouzhi to trade before returning.\n\nGeying lies south of Gouzhi, a journey of about a month. Along the way, a great mountain forest stretches to the sea’s edge, called Puluo. Within it dwell strange people with tails six *cun* long, who delight in devouring humans. In form, they stand between man and beast: if called human, they have tails and eat people; if called beast, they walk upright and wear headdresses. Their tails resemble those of beasts, but their gait is human. By their appearance, they exist between man and beast. Their hair is black as lacquer, their teeth white as silver, and their eyes red. Men and women go naked, without clothing, and fathers, sons, brothers, and sisters lie together openly. These are the barbarians of Geying; the kingdom has other, more refined people as well.\n\nLinyang lies over two thousand li west of Funan. Its men and women are fair-skinned and kind, and all revere the Dao. They use gold and silver as currency and produce plentiful cinnabar, sulfur, azurite, malachite, and purple quartz. They favor crimson silk and white pearls, which are the local attire.\n\nJiachen lies on the seashore southwest of Geying. The waters near its coast are shallow, and pirates from various kingdoms often lie in wait to rob travelers. Merchants must travel in groups to venture there.\n\nShihan lies southwest of Gouzhi. Sailing from Gouzhi takes fourteen or fifteen days to reach it. The kingdom has a king, and all revere the Great Dao. They are pure and observe proper rites, maintaining the dignity of the Han. Thus, it is called the Kingdom of Shihan. Immortals dwell there, and it produces luminous moon pearls. The people practice benevolence and kindness and abhor killing. The land is vast and fertile, with over ten thousand households. It abounds in gold, jade, and sulfur.\n\nHuli lies southwest of Gunu and Sidiao, seven or eight hundred li into a great bay. A great river originates in the northwest of Kunlun, flowing southeast into the sea. West of the river’s mouth, across over ten thousand li, lies Da Qin. Sailing in large ships carrying five or six hundred people, with seven sails catching the wind, takes a month to reach Da Qin.\n\nDadao lies in the middle of Sidiao, an island in the sea southeast of Geying, about three thousand li away. A king and his people reside there, devoted to the Great Dao. Their language and customs resemble those of the Central Kingdom. They govern with walled cities, markets, streets, and alleys. The land is fertile and beautiful, its people prosperous. It produces many rare treasures: gold, silver, white pearls, tortoiseshell, crystal, and *mahuo*.\n\nMoreover, there is a *fire pearl*, as large as a goose or duck’s egg, which appears like ice to the eye. When held in the hand, it is translucent, its light like moonlight illuminating the palm—visible even at night. If one points the fire pearl toward the sun in daylight and places mugwort tinder beneath it, after a moment, a beam of fire descends straight from the pearl, scattering like water dripping from a roof’s eaves. Suddenly, smoke rises and the tinder ignites, much like using a yang-sui to kindle fire. Those that emit water when facing shade are called *night-shining pearls*. Though they differ in producing water or fire, their essence is the same—only their names vary based on their refined properties.\n\nGazing southeast from the land of Sidiao at night, one often sees firelight illuminating the sky, as if from a great forge. Peering into the dark, the glow of that fire is said to mark the location of Yanzhou. There stands a *fire mountain*, where flames burn winter and summer alike.\n\nThe kingdom of Yinzhang lies some thirty or forty thousand *li* from Sidiao, rarely reached by travelers. Only once in several decades do people from Yanzhou sail to Sidiao. A hundred fire pearls are among the goods this land sells, which is how the people of Sidiao acquire them.\n\nThe land also has hills and paddy fields, fish and meat, fruits and grains, as well as beans, taro, and other crops. There grows a tree called *mahu*, resembling a pine. Boiling its bark and leaves yields a juice used to make cakes. When simmered and eaten, their taste is sweet and fragrant beyond compare, like malt sugar. They nourish the *qi* and are nearly a perfect food.\n\nDa Qin lies west of the ancient land of Gunu, some forty thousand *li* away, spanning thirty thousand *li* in territory—the greatest of kingdoms. Its people are tall and radiant, their angular caps filling the roads, their customs like those of Chang’an. This land is the source of the Great Dao, where discourse on the void and the subtle is unparalleled, far surpassing the empty words of those in the Central Kingdom.\n\nDaoists stand shoulder to shoulder, preserving the ways of high antiquity. They keep no slaves, and even the king and queen personally plow the fields and tend mulberry trees to weave silk, governing through the Dao. The people respond with righteousness, and no punishments, blades, or executions are used. The people are gentle and harmonious, many living long lives. The land is pure and temperate, neither cold nor hot. The gentry and common folk defer to one another, and the kingdom knows no wickedness—such is the transformative power of the Dao’s *qi*, the profound retreat of the noble. Here, the teachings of reward and retribution are made manifest, guiding all beings to embrace its transformation, beginning with Da Qin.\n\nThe people revere the Dao, extending its influence to the eight distant regions, much as the Old Master crossed the shifting sands to transform the Hu. Traveling from the sea into the great river for over seven thousand *li* brings one to this land. All the world’s treasures originate here, and in every household, coral serves as window lattices, tortoiseshell as walls, and crystal as steps and thresholds.\n\nOnce, people from the Central Kingdom journeyed to Funan, then boarded a ship from Funan, sailing into the sea intending to reach the land of Gunu. But the winds shifted, and they could not reach it, drifting elsewhere. Sailing day and night without rest, after sixty days they finally reached a shore—though they knew not where. Upon disembarking, they asked the locals and were told it was Da Qin. The merchants, having arrived at an unintended destination, were greatly alarmed, fearing capture and harm. They then pretended to be envoys of the king of Funan, sent to meet the king of Da Qin.\n\nThe king, seeing them, was astonished and said: “Your land lies at the farthest edge of the sea—how is it that people still come? From which kingdom do you hail, and why do you claim to be envoys of Funan?” They replied: “Your servants are envoys from the king of Funan at the northern sea’s edge, come to pay homage at your court, bowing in reverence. We have also heard of the rare treasures in your kingdom and wish to request some of your finest goods to bring glory to our humble land.”\n\nThe king of Da Qin said: “Are you people from the borderlands of Zhou? To brave the vast sea for twenty thousand *li* to reach my court—how arduous your journey must have been! When I first saw you arrive, I feared you had come to observe our ways, to assess the depth of our customs and the flow of our affairs. How could I have guessed you were driven by greed for rare goods, opening the door to strife and competition? Do you seek fine treasures only to strain your eyes and minds, fostering deceit and theft while increasing toil? Why would you risk your lives on the waves, so recklessly casting yourselves into the great sea?\n\nAs for the governance of Zhou—where men race after fleeting wealth and status—is this not contemptible? Is this not ruinous? From afar, I have witnessed its transformation: signs of chaos already appear across the six directions, and corrupt governance is evident even at the eight extremes. Nevertheless, since you have come to request gifts, I shall grant them for your return journey.”\n\nThen he bestowed upon the envoys purple-gold night-glowing pearls, five-colored dark pearls, coral spirit-jades, white harmony and uncarved essence, interlocking divine jade and luminous tiger gems, vajra and all manner of sacred treasures, sending them off at once. He admonished them, saying: “Our kingdom fundamentally esteems the Dao and virtue, holding such things in disdain; we honor benevolence and righteousness while despising greed and rapacity, cherish integrity and wisdom while rejecting dissipation and excess. We revere immortals to seek spiritual harmony, and respect purity and emptiness to preserve the four qi. We regard these motley, variegated objects as a flying swan regards insects and women.\n\nShould you return again with such goods, you will only incite competition within our pure land, harming the people’s eyes and minds. Deceit and strife will arise in our governance, and our refined customs will thereby decay. I shall instruct the gatekeepers to bar your entry.” His words served as a covenant of the heart, and the envoys departed in silence.\n\nFour years later, they arrived in Funan. The envoys first presented the king with a thousand bolts of colored silk from their ship’s cargo. The king laughed and said: “Barbarian silks—how coarse and flimsy! When goods are meager, the people suffer; this is no empty saying. Such things are of no use in our kingdom, so take them back.” He then displayed for the envoys the marvels of his jades and silks: eight-hued damasks, flowing azure brocades, fabrics woven with jade-threads, and sapphires embroidered with golden patterns. White as snow, red as dawn, blue surpassing kingfisher feathers, black like soaring crows—their radiance dazzled, their five colors richly arrayed, each bolt four feet wide and flawless. Seeing the envoys’ shabby attire, he scoffed: “The silks of the northern lands are truly laughable! Our Da Qin kingdom lacks nothing, and all is fine. The goods of the Central Kingdom can never compare.” As for their incense burners, they all used aloeswood and frankincense, their fragrance thick and lingering. The land knew no foul odors—truly a flourishing realm.\n\nUpon returning, the envoys recounted all this, and from then on, none dared journey again to Da Qin. Merchants spread the word, and trade ceased entirely. It is said that only those who personally practice benevolence and righteousness, uphold simplicity and detachment, delight in the emptiness of the Dao, and harbor no inner desires may journey to Da Qin and find fulfillment. Those who seek only exchange and profit act without reason.\n\nThe people of Da Qin are fair-skinned, tall, and often over ten feet in height. Their bearing is dignified, their conduct governed by ritual and measure. When still, they are serene; when speaking, their voices rise like clouds. Their interactions are noble and upright. Yet when they encounter merchants—men of no refined speech, ignorant of governance and advancement, driven only by greed—the king of Da Qin holds them in even greater contempt, declaring that all the people of Zhou are the same.\n\nLong ago, when the Laozi saw Zhou’s decline, he entered Da Qin to transform it, hence its name Funan. The envoys were men of Zhou. In Zhou’s time, the Four Seas submitted, and Funan paid tribute, as when the Yuechang people presented white pheasants and ivory to Zhou. Now, all the barbarians call the Central Kingdom “Han people” or “Jin people.” Da Qin lies so far from China that none travel between them. Since Laozi once served as a Zhou archivist before entering Da Qin, they must have called it the “Zhou kingdom,” unaware that Zhou had long since passed through a hundred dynasties.\n\nThe kingdom of Gunu Sidiao lies some ten thousand *li* from Geying. Its land and people number over ten thousand households, most fair-skinned and tall. The people all ride four-wheeled carriages drawn by two or four horses, gathering at crossroads. Their ships number over a hundred, and their markets host tens of thousands, trading day and night. As the ships sail, they sound drums, pipes, and horns. The people’s clothing resembles that of China, and their land yields gold and jade as common as tiles and stones. This kingdom also reveres the Great Dao.\n\nThe kingdom of Chalao lies between Anxi and Da Qin, a great land. Over five thousand *li* from Tianzhu, its people are brave and strong. The entire kingdom claims descent from kings, yet has no permanent ruler. Instead, they select elders of virtue and renown to serve as king, replacing them every three years. The whole land honors them. The land’s produce is the same as Tianzhu’s, with even more treasures too numerous to name. The people of Chalao cherish their homeland and never travel far, living in peace and contentment. The kingdom has no punishments or executions, only the cultivation of benevolence, righteousness, blessings, and virtue—a land of profound harmony.\n\nThe kingdom of Yebo lies three thousand *li* from Tianzhu. Its people and land are the same as Tianzhu’s.\n\nThe kingdom of Jibin lies northwest of Yuezhi, a great land. Its terrain is vast and flat, its people gentle. It has alfalfa, rare trees, sandalwood, catalpa, bamboo, lacquer, and saffron. They cultivate the five grains, grapes, and various fruits. Their fields are often low and damp, so they plant rice. The people are highly skilled, excelling in carving, engraving, and embroidery. They enjoy music, wine, and feasting. Their lands yield gibbons, peacocks, pearls, amber, tortoiseshell, crystal, and livestock like those of China. Alfalfa is a divine treasure.\n\nThe plant resembles a taro. When a person’s eyes become blind and the sockets are entirely hollowed out, one may extract the juice from its roots and consume it, or boil its stems and leaves into a decoction to apply to the hollow, rotted sockets. After seven or eight days, the pupils and irises will regenerate, and the eyes will be fully restored.\n\nAn ancient legend tells of a man afflicted with blindness who was suddenly summoned by the king of his time. Facing the royal command, he had no time to prepare medicine. A divine physician instructed him to borrow one of his wife’s eyes for use, and he followed the physician’s words. The physician took a blade and carved out the wife’s eye, lending it to the man for a single night before returning it. When the physician first removed the eye, he had the man drink the juice of the herb’s roots and soak the eye in it, so that when he carved it, the wife felt no pain. Placing the eye into the man’s socket, he blended it with the same juice, and it immediately became one with his body, allowing him to see all things clearly. When the eye was returned, the physician again used the juice, and it reverted to its original state.\n\nThis herb is a divine plant bestowed by heaven, its wonders beyond description. Thus, it is called *muxu* grass, for it was borrowed for a night. In my youth, I heard this tale but dismissed it as false. Later, in the southern frontier, I inquired among scholars, and those with knowledge said: *Muxu* grass grows on a separate mountain in the kingdom of Jibin, appearing only once every hundred years. Its form resembles the Chinese sweet flag, and it is exceedingly rare—only the most devoted may behold it. This mountain is now called Muxu Mountain. Its many springs are blue-green, and when the people of Jibin, young or old, suffer from eye ailments, they are carried in litters to bathe in these springs, and none fail to recover. If the water alone can cure eye diseases, how much more effective must the divine herb, which grows but once in a century, be in healing hollowed, rotted sockets?\n\nAs the ancient legends foretell, upon examining the mountains and rivers, one finds that such wonders must exist. There was a foreigner named Shi Yanzhang who had long resided in Funan and frequently traveled abroad. He claimed to have visited Jibin and seen Muxu Mountain, though it was not particularly tall. The mountain bore no other plants but was filled with rare trees resembling *tuo*. When these trees were felled and used to craft tables, chairs, cart seats, or buildings, or even broken into smaller pieces, they were buried in the earth and would regrow like planted willows. These were called \"miscellaneous rare trees.\" If buried beneath Muxu Mountain, they would thrive, but in other lands, they would not grow.\n\n*(Hong’s note: This mountain must be a hill of immortality. How can one say this? Its herb, when used, restores sight to rotted eyes and grants clarity; its trees, though felled, may be replanted after a hundred years. The mountain’s stones possess a divine power to restore human essence, and its flowing springs nurture even decayed wood back to life. Truly, one could dwell here to nourish the body, follow the mountain’s *qi*, and enjoy eternal tranquility—yet the people of that land have long failed to realize this.)*\n\nYuezhi lies seven thousand *li* north of Tianzhu. Its horses and treasures are like those of Tianzhu. The land is high and cold, and all ride four-wheeled carts, some drawn by four, five, or even six or seven yokes. No cart is small, and the largest can hold twenty people. The king is called the Son of Heaven, and the capital’s populace numbers in the hundreds of thousands. Its cities, palaces, and halls resemble those of Da Qin. The people are Hu in appearance but exceptionally fair, and their clothing and rituals reflect filial piety—fathers are kind, children obedient. Their laws are strict, and they do not squat when seated, surpassing even Tianzhu in these virtues. Some there follow the Great Dao.\n\nThe land spans two thousand *li* in each direction. It is cold and abundant in frost and snow. Ginger does not grow there, and they rely on Tianzhu for it. They have no silkworms and weave wool into fine fabrics. Some dogs and sheep have wool two or three *chi* long, which men and women alike use continuously.\n\nAnxi lies eight thousand *li* west of Yuezhi. Its land and customs are entirely like those of Yuezhi. Its people and horses are fierce and brave. The land spans five thousand *li*, and gold and jade are as common as stone, used as currency. When a king dies, new coins are cast. The land has dogs, horses, and great birds. To its left lies a territory ruled by over a hundred kings, who dwell separately and do not submit to Yuezhi.\n\nYouqian lies seven thousand *li* southeast of Tianzhu. Its land, people, and customs are all like those of Tianzhu. The rare and precious objects it produces surpass even those of Yuezhi. From this, one knows the vastness of heaven and earth, beyond the reach of imagination. Though these kingdoms are distant, they will be recorded later—yet none know their boundaries.\n\nDa Qin and Yuezhi are said to border Kunlun, lying southwest of the Rinan Sea route. They are the greatest lands of which we have heard.\n\nThe various fragrant substances each have their origins. *Chen* and *fu* woods come from Rinan. *Duliang* and *qingling* come from Dianxun. *Jishe* and *fenluo* grow in Dubo. *Youjian* and *rulai* come from Wulun. *Qingmu* is from Tianzhu, *yujin* from Jibin, *suhe* from Anxi, and *xunlu* from Da Qin—all are treasures of their respective plants, whether flowers, resins, hearts, or branches.\n\nOnly *jiaxiang*, conch shells, and the like are born in the depths of Geying, Juzhi, and other such seas. *Weiluo* comes from Yuezhi, sulfur from Dukun, *baifu* from Shihan, *guangbi* from Jiachen, *lan* and *ai* from these lands, and *youmu* from Youqian. None of their wondrous aromas compare to *zhen tan*.\n\n*The Lower Scroll of the Scripture of Divine Elixir of Golden Liquor from the Great Clarity is hereby concluded.*",

      "translated_text": "**The Supreme Clarity Scripture of the Divine Elixir of Golden Liquor**\n\n**Title:** *The Supreme Clarity Scripture of the Divine Elixir of Golden Liquor*\n**Attributed to:** Zhang Daoling, Yin Changsheng, and Ge Hong (Baopuzi), et al.\n**Approximate date:** Late Eastern Jin dynasty\n**Content:** External alchemy, including methods of transmuting cinnabar and lead (huangbai), with additional practices on circulating *qi* and maintaining unity.\n**Three scrolls.**\n**Source text:** *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Comprehensive Arts* section under the *Cavernous Divine* category.\n\n---\n\n### *The Supreme Clarity Scripture of the Divine Elixir of Golden Liquor, Scroll One*\n**Preface by the Orthodox Celestial Master Zhang Daoling**\n\nThe mystery of the Void is nameless, yet we designate it as the *Dao*. The term *Dao* signifies awakening. Just as one who sleeps through the night awakens at dawn, so too does the great dream precede the great awakening. At the extremity of awakening from dreams, how can it be lightly described?\n\nClinging to life is weakness and loss; delighting in death is joy in nothingness. Yet joy in nothingness is still a lack, and clinging to existence is delusion. Even delight in nothingness fails to attain true understanding. Only through transcendent observation—where both are forgotten—does one return to the Mystery. Having forgotten, one must then forget even the act of forgetting. Mind and intellect dissolve into the realm of being and non-being, while spirit and essence congeal in the profoundest Mystery. This is the realization of those who exhaust principle and fulfill their nature.\n\nLike a potter’s clay, they subtly shape the path of effortless transformation, responding silently to the myriad stimuli of the world. Scattered yet near, they traverse the depths of the obscure and the luminous, for their achievement cannot be confined to a single form nor verified by a single name.\n\nThe titles of emperors and kings have never been uniform. Why then doubt the *Dao* alongside Yao and Confucius? The distinction lies merely in inner and outer teachings, hence the depth or shallowness of their principles.\n\nIf we seek in the physical form, we find wonders: scaled bodies with four breasts, double pupils and multicolored brows—all extraordinary. Jinyun, born speaking, sat in audience with the hundred spirits, ruled the realm, rode clouds to command tigers and leopards, and at life’s end ascended in transcendence, mounting a flying dragon to depart the six directions. Yet when one surveys the world within the Red Continent, the affairs of bowing and rising seem as fleeting as children playing in a courtyard, vying for a single toy.\n\nThere are also those who, like guests reclining on pillows in the hollows of Mount Kongtong, follow the wind’s course and converse on the *Dao* of nurturing spirit. These are the grand discourses on order and chaos in the world, where refinement and coarseness differ. Yet even those who inquire deeply, their hair like mist at the windows, have not yet penetrated the inner chambers.\n\nAs for the subtleties of spiritual transformation and the most wondrous teachings—the supreme principle beyond principle, the great \"thusness\" beyond \"thusness\"—these are fully expounded in the Mysterious Tradition, not to be conveyed by a single hair’s breadth.\n\nLaozi, too, elucidated the Mystery of the Void and recorded the *Dao*. His divine virtue and the circumstances of his manifestations inspired him to compose scriptures, establish teachings, and document extraordinary accounts. He harmonized the *Dao* and the secular, distinguishing the three realms. First, he illuminated the principles of compliance and defiance, then swept them away in the forgetting of both. He extolled virtue yet ultimately governed it with non-being. His utility in action and stillness remains unseen in its origins. The people use it daily, unaware of its source. Such is his authority, manifest in clarity and serving as the bridge for all things.\n\nHis *Dao* is scripture; his virtue is scripture. Tracing the lineage to its origin, exhausting the Mystery to its subtleties, he gathers all branches to the true root and unites ten thousand strands in one essential. Vast and unbroken, luminous yet not dazzling, he both penetrates the ultimate *Dao* and humbly expands its worldly teachings.\n\nHis words are profound yet not obscure, distant yet savorable. Majestic and lofty, expansive and grand, they exalt the joy of the Three Ones and the mirror of the Six Nines. Through breath-holding and prolonged respiration, one contends for the years of the three luminaries. Through embryonic nurturing of the Five, one attains the attainment of the numinous perfected. Clear as the kind wind striking jade, radiant as the morning sun illuminating a treasury of gems.\n\nHis governance is all-encompassing, perfecting all without omission. At first, it seems towering and dense; in the end, it is subtle and formless. He smelts the myriad images in the crucible of the Mystery, guiding all differences to a single return.\n\nIn his analogies, he is discerning yet not divergent, broad yet not disordered. Subtle yet manifest, discordant yet harmonious, he embraces the strange and wondrous within the great square, transcending obscurity and difference to naturally align. Great is this wondrous chant—truly divine! The extremity of discourse on principle cannot be surpassed.\n\nAs for the efficacy of the Golden Elixir: its numinous workings are profound, its transformations obscure. The dragon transmutes, the spirit illumines, the two unite as one. Those who are withered and cut off revive; those who embrace the vital breath attain long years. Ascending the luminous Han to soar beyond, roaming the cloud peaks in freedom—even the face and body radiate jade light, sprouting rare fur. They spit water and rinse with fire, fly without wings, divide their forms into ten thousand changes, and act at will. They dam rivers without effort, cleave mountains without axes. With a shout, clouds and rain darken the sky; with a gesture, forests shift. Their divinity is beyond record, their wonders beyond omission. Great is the numinous essence—inexpressible in full!\n\nDaoling, born later and unenlightened, never met the great assembly. Adrift without bound, a thousand years have passed. The divine masters have upheld the Way, guiding me across perilous straits. Emerging from my own confusion, I gaze upward at the level path of the Mystery—unbarred and open. Not that it cannot be opened, but that I lacked the ability.\n\nMy disciples have secretly observed the Mysterious Root and grasped the key to its gate. My disciples Zhao Sheng and Wang Chang, reflecting on their shadows and pressing their hearts, were overwhelmed with shame and remorse. Their spiritual insight was boundless, and they encountered the profound person of Mysterious Clarity. Their inner mirrors stood firm, first extracting what their diligence had penetrated. Thus, they glimpsed the mysteries of the supreme sages, overheard their meanings, and provisionally offered explanations. They transformed their observations and aspirations, recording what they had witnessed. They marked and compared the lofty principles, then measured and composed annotations.\n\nThe preface states: \"First illuminate compliance and defiance, then sweep them away in the forgetting of both\"—this is for the sake of preserving life. To go against life is defiance; to nurture life is compliance.",

      "translated_text": "Those who attain compliance do not dwell on defiance; those who attain defiance do not scrutinize compliance. This is called the divergent principles of life and death, the boundary of attaining the One. The forgetting of \"forgetting both\" means each forgets what they ought to forget—just as the well-dwelling fish does not delight in becoming a sea-scaled creature, nor the forest beast wish to be an ox or horse. Each receives life differently, for their heavenly endowments are inherently distinct.\n\nThe preface states: \"First extol those of virtue, then unify them through non-reliance\"—this refers to Lord Lao’s practice of *xingqi* (circulating qi) and *daoyin* (guiding and pulling), inhaling and exhaling the fluid of Great Harmony. Extolling inhalation ensures the attainment of qi; unifying the subtle and void through exhalation and absorption smooths the passageways, leaving no reliance or harm. Emerging from the Mysterious and entering the Mysterious, breath flows without question, embodying both body and spirit, never departing from the person.\n\nThe preface states: \"Beneficial use permeates all living beings, yet its origin remains unseen. The common people daily employ it for good, unaware of its source—this is its authority manifest in clarity, serving as the bridge for the myriad things.\" Now, this beneficial use is the spirit and qi. Spirit and qi daily serve the body’s functions, yet the multitude does not recognize their origin. Spirit and qi daily sustain the four limbs, yet the foolish masses do not know they depend on them to live. A person cannot be without qi for even a moment, nor can they lose their spirit through carelessness. Losing spirit causes the five viscera to decay; losing qi leads to collapse and death. The corpse gains life through qi; the skeleton remains whole through qi. Qi and spirit move in tandem; spirit and qi constantly rely on each other for strength. When spirit departs, qi vanishes; when qi fades, the body perishes. Though all people fear death and delight in life, they do not know that the work of living lies in spirit and qi. Thus, they repeatedly agitate their minds and offend their qi, frequently indulge their spirits and wither their lives. Those who do not cherish stillness and fail to preserve their true nature will surely meet premature decay. Yet if one does not seek longevity, this authority manifests in clarity. Clarity is the light of the sun and moon. Though one may witness the sun and moon’s eternal flow, none can escape the traces of calamity among the myriad things. When the myriad things sense the fault of gain and loss, life must then have its bridge and barrier. Calamity will surely arise, and mutual opposition will emerge. The enlightened must therefore cherish essence and guard qi to seek prolonged vision. Harmonizing and nurturing all things brings the blessing of branches and leaves.\n\nThe preface states: \"In the grandeur of solitary observation, one delights in the Three Ones and marks the mirror to cultivate the Six-Nines’ positions.\" Closing the void and prolonging breath contends for the years of the Three Luminaries. Nurturing the five elements seeks the attainment of numinous perfection. The Three Ones refer to the three regions: brain, heart, and navel. The Upper One, the Mud-Pill Palace Lord, resides in the head; the Middle One, the Crimson Palace Lord, dwells in the heart; the Lower One, the Cinnabar Field Lord, abides in the navel. Preserving them makes the Three Palaces resplendent; neglecting them leaves the body in profound stillness. Those who cherish life delight in preserving them; those who court death abandon them for fleeting joy. Thus, the grandeur of solitary observation delights in the Three Ones.\n\nAs the *Immortal Classic* states: \"If you desire long life, the Three Ones must be illuminated. The Dao is precisely here.\" From midnight to noon is the time of generative qi; from noon to midnight is the time of dead qi. Always lie supine during the time of generative qi, close your eyes, clench your fists, and hold your breath within the heart, counting to two hundred before exhaling. Increase the count daily. In this way, body and spirit unite, the five viscera find peace. If you can hold your breath to two hundred and fifty, the Crimson Palace’s spirit guards, the Mud-Pill remains full, and the Cinnabar Field flourishes. At three hundred, the Flowery Canopy shines, ears and eyes grow keen, the whole body becomes free of illness, and noxious qi no longer invades. Jade maidens come as attendants, granting boundless longevity—this is marking the mirror to cultivate the Six-Nines’ positions. The Six refers to exhalation and absorption governing the six qi; the Nine refers to the ranks of the nine elixirs. The Lady of Supreme Perfection, Wang, has already recorded these. Lord Lao said: \"From dawn to dusk, practice unceasingly, and you will attain long life.\"\n\nIn the method of *xingqi*, there is one internal qi and six exhalations. The one internal qi refers to inhalation. The six exhalations—blowing, exhaling, sighing, humming, hissing, and swallowing—are all ways of expelling qi. Every person’s breath consists of one inhalation and one exhalation. To prolong life, the breath should be long and unified. The method of breath regulation: when cold, blow; when warm, exhale. Blow to dispel cold, exhale to dispel heat, sigh to dispel illness, hum to dispel wind, hum softly to dispel vexation and lower qi, hiss to disperse stagnation, and swallow to relieve exhaustion. When people are exhausted, they often sigh and swallow. Daoist practitioners of *xingqi* avoid sighing and swallowing, for these are the forgetting of prolonged breath. Mastering the six qi leads to becoming a Heavenly Immortal. Cultivating natural spirit and qi means marking and embracing the Nine Elixirs’ positions—this is called the mirror. The mirror’s mark lies in the elixir classics’ qi preservation, ensuring distant years and an unfallen lifespan.\n\nThe preface states: \"Closing, hissing, and prolonging breath to contend for the years of the Three Luminaries\"—this refers to all methods of *xingqi*. The method of *xingqi* begins with settling the body, dispelling all anger and sorrow, releasing all worries, and harmonizing the qi without contention. If harmony is absent, cease practice. Only when the body is at ease should one proceed, maintaining constancy without weariness. When qi arrives, the form finds peace; when the form is at peace, breath harmonizes; when breath harmonizes, pure qi arrives; when pure qi arrives, one naturally senses prolonged breath. If the body grows hot, open the mouth slightly and close it to savor the sweet fragrance. As fluids increase, the five viscera endure, and endurance brings longevity equal to heaven, earth, and the Three Luminaries.\n\n\"Nurturing the five elements to seek the attainment of numinous perfection\" refers to fetal nourishment and guiding cultivation. The method of fetal nourishment: at dawn, rinse the mouth with water and swallow until sated—this too brings long life.",

They transformed their observations and aspirations, recording what they had witnessed. They marked and compared the lofty principles, then measured and composed annotations.\n\nThe preface states: \"First illuminate compliance and defiance, then sweep them away in the forgetting of both\"—this is for the sake of preserving life. To go against life is defiance; to nurture life is compliance.",

      "translated_text": "Having been born in satiety, the five viscera naturally attain numinous efficacy, and the attainment of numinous perfection lies precisely herein.\n\nThe *Scriptures of the Immortals* state: \"With the jade pool’s pure water, irrigate the numinous root.\" The *Supreme Clarity Scripture of the Divine Elixir of Golden Liquor*, Scroll the First, declares: \"If one can cultivate this, one may endure forever. Press it to yield clear water, fair and fresh.\"\n\nThe mouth is the \"jade pool\" and the \"Palace of Grand Harmony.\" As for what is called \"natural consumption,\" those who nurture life rely solely on qi and the elixir. The subtle and profound teachings of the scriptures are abstruse and difficult to expound. Having once heard the master’s instruction, I now set it forth here.\n\nAs for the esoteric words of Kongtong, which elucidate the mysterious perfection of the Dao and virtue, these have already been expounded in the past. Since they are not essential to present practice, further elaboration would be superfluous. To reiterate or annotate them would only invite redundancy and prolixity; let those of the Way in times to come cultivate them accordingly.\n\nTo prepare the Six-One Clay, the finest days are the fifth day of the fifth month, the seventh day of the seventh month, and the ninth day of the ninth month. Auspicious days for kindling the elixir fire are jia-shen, yi-si, and yi-mao. Days to avoid when compounding the elixir are:\n\n**Spring:** wu-chen, ji-si\n**Summer:** ding-si, wu-shen, ren-chen, ji-wei\n**Autumn:** wu-xu, xin-hai, geng-zi\n**Winter:** wu-yin, ren-xu, ji-mao, gui-you\n\nAlso to be avoided are the monthly killers, counter-branch days, the first, middle, and last days of the month, days of closure (bing-xu, ding-hai, ren-xu, gui-hai, xin-si), the monthly establishment, all dark moons and new moons, the eight baleful stars, days of wandering death—all these are inauspicious and will not yield success.\n\nWhen procuring the divine medicine, one should do so in a place of virtue, seated or standing, without haggling over price. The transaction should occur on a day of receipt. Bathe on a zi or chou day, first maintaining purification for seven days, then procure the authentic ingredients of the divine elixir. Once completed, store it in a silken brocade pouch or a golden cylinder.\n\nWhen compounding the divine medicine, begin on a jia-zi day of the \"opening\" or \"removal\" phase. First purify oneself for three times seven days, then proceed to compound the medicine, with no more than two or three persons present. Exercise utmost care and avoid entering households tainted by mourning or defilement.\n\nWhen sublimating the medicine, do not allow fools, women, children, those in mourning, the defiled, the envious, the garrulous, or those who do not believe in the Dao to witness it. If such persons see or hear of it, the medicine will fail, and its spirit will flee.\n\nThe ideal location is a secluded mountain forest or stone chamber, far from human habitation, where neither the barking of dogs nor the voices of men can be heard. Furthermore, one must avoid the sight of the dead, the wounded, or blood—beware of this.\n\nOnce the divine medicine is prepared, dwell alone in a chamber, for the divine immortals and jade maidens, along with their attending officials, will come and go. One must revere them. Carry the divine elixir constantly at the elbow, and in all self-cultivation, vigilance and caution are paramount.\n\nWhen compounding the medicine, use a jia-zi day, preferably one of the \"opening\" or \"removal\" phase, for greater efficacy. Continuously burn incense and maintain purification for three times seven days. For the first seven-day purification, remain present throughout the night.\n\nWhen setting up the cauldron and preparing the altar, offer sacrifice to the Supreme Unity, the Most High Perfected Divinity. Use two *hu* of clear wine, three *hu* each of yellow millet and white non-glutinous rice (taking two *dou* of each to steam), two *dou* of large dried jujubes, three *dou* of pears, five *dou* each of salt and fermented beans, ten *jin* of incense, and fine cakes and fruits such as sweet oranges (if sweet oranges are unavailable in the north, omit them). Prepare four woven mats for the offering. Use nine clean trays and eighty-one cups; if cups are unavailable, large bowls may suffice. After the ritual, burn the mats and trays entirely.\n\nThe sacrifice should resemble that offered to the gods of heaven and earth. Arrange the utensils oneself, setting out all items and placing them appropriately for the compounding of the elixir. The officiant should wear new, clean clothes, fasten the sash, and use nine incense burners, ensuring the smoke intertwines. Place one incense burner on each of the nine trays.\n\nThe officiant, kneeling, should bow twice and prostrate twice, then declare:\n*\"I, a humble servant of the Great Dao, so-and-so, bow twice and prostrate twice again.\"* Repeat this as before, making a total of eighteen bows.\n\nAfter inviting the gods, ensure the voice carries ten paces. Then, standing, invoke the following in a slow, measured tone:\n*\"The Nine Heavenly Perfected Kings, the Three Heavenly Perfected Sovereigns, the Most High Sovereign Lord, the August Sovereign Lord, the Supreme Lord, the Supreme Thearch, the Nine Heavenly Three Venerable Lords, the Three Heavenly Three Venerable Lords, the Supreme Perfected, the Supreme Earthly Perfected, the Numinous Perfected Jade Maidens, the Nine Qi Elders, the Nine Elder Immortals of the Immortal Capital, the Supreme Clarity Immortal King, the Heavenly Perfected Supreme Unity Lord, the Earthly Perfected Supreme Unity Lord, the Capital Supreme Unity Lord, the Central Supreme Unity Lord, the Immortal Supreme Unity Lord, the Earthly Immortal Supreme Unity Lord, the Supreme Unity Jade Lads, the Jade Maidens, the Yellow Silk and Purple Radiance Two Lords, the Yellow Silk and Purple Radiance Two Ladies, the Canopy of Flowering Fire Radiance Envoy, the Nine Radiance Elder, the Vermilion Ancestral Lord of the Southern Luminaries—may you all open the gates of heaven, descend upon my seat in clouds, and attend this rite.\"*\n\nThe officiant then bows nine times, kowtows nine times, and strikes the breast nine times, kneeling upright. Lowering the voice further, he continues slowly:\n*\"On this day, month, and year, I, so-and-so of such-and-such prefecture, county, village, and hamlet, of such-and-such name and style, aged so many years, humbly invoke the Most High Sacred Divinities of the Nine and Three Heavens to descend upon this mountain.\"*\n\nAfter a long pause, he continues in a measured tone:\n*\"I truly know not the origins of heaven and earth since their inception, nor the ancestral surname from which I descend, nor from which lineage I spring. I know not from what kind of creature—be it beast, spring, fish, or flying and crawling thing—I emerged, nor the origins of the Hu, Qiang, Yi, Di, Xianbei, or Xian Di. I know not from which direction I was born, nor the nature of the Eight Southern Man barbarians, the Six Western Rong, the Five Northern Di, or the Nine Eastern Yi. I know not from which quarter I came, nor how we have lived, transmitted, and nourished one another, accumulating countless calamities and transgressions, enduring endless punishments and retributions. Thus, my seven generations of ancestors, my five generations of forebears, my three generations of great-grandparents, my grandparents, and my parents have all borne the sins of past lives without number. Some have been exiled to hell, bearing mountains of stone, consigned to the River Earls, or subjected to the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water—molten copper poured down their throats, tongues torn out, cast into the vast currents, their souls weighed and tormented, fed thorns, heads scorched, backs branded with iron, enduring the cycles of life and death. The punishments and retributions for their transgressions and offenses are manifold.\"*",

      "translated_text": "May I beseech the Nine Heavens, the Three Heavens, the August Supreme Unity, and all the lords and elders to absolve the calamities and punishments I have incurred since my seven generations past. May all my transgressions—those of my present life through countless kalpas, my myriad deaths, my myriad sins, and my myriad faults—be wholly pardoned. May I behold the era of Great Peace and gaze upon the true and sagely sovereign.\n\nWith this entreaty, I rise and perform nine prostrations, nine kowtows, and nine self-strikes. Then, offering wine anew, I kneel and say: From my youth, I have cherished the pursuit of longevity and yearned for the numinous immortals. Formerly, I received from my late master, so-and-so, the method of the Golden Liquor. Now, in this auspicious year, month, and hour, I prepare to compound it. Yet, not daring to act alone, I first humbly present this offering.\n\nI prostrate myself and pray that the Most High Lord Lao, the Lord of Supreme Harmony, the Heavenly Illuminated Divine Immortals, the Mysterious Maiden and the Plain Maiden, and the Azure-Waisted Jade Maidens may descend to assist in its completion. May the various Lords of the Supreme Unity and the Jade Maidens of the Supreme Unity deign to oversee and witness beneath the Yellow and Purple Canopies.\n\nI humbly beseech that the medicine neither scatter nor stray, neither fly nor soar. May it transform at my touch, transmuting all into yellow and white, ascending to the Purple Palace. May my life span extend for billions of millennia, and may I attain the rank of Perfected One. May I harmonize the divine qi and the radiant essence, the primordial and celestial qi, with the Supreme Unity as my guardian and the Jade Maidens as my constant attendants. May all the lords and elders erase the record of my death-sentence and inscribe my name in the register of the living.\n\nAgain, I rise and perform nine bows, nine kowtows, and nine self-strikes, offering wine and increasing the incense.\n\nAfter a while, I kneel once more and say: Now, within this mountain cavern, I compound the divine elixir. May I command ghosts and spirits, drive and tame tigers and leopards, ride upon rainbows and dragons. May the mountain spirits and the myriad demons all show reverence and awe, submitting to my discipline and receiving my protection. May all obstacles before me be obliterated, and may metal and stone yield.\n\nI further beseech the Perfected Ones and Divine Lords of the Five Peaks and renowned mountains to manifest and provide defense. May I achieve bodily division and transformation, attaining longevity and enduring vision.\n\nAgain, I perform nine bows, nine kowtows, and nine self-strikes. Having presented all this, any further private transgressions or hidden faults I may confess, seeking mercy and absolution, may be offered at will.\n\nWhen all has been spoken, I may modestly pour wine and present fine incense and fruits before the Perfected Kings, drinking the wine and performing nine bows each time.\n\nFirst, at the appointed hour, I invite one or two assistants to compound the elixir, keeping them thirty paces from the sacrificial site, their ears sealed with wax. If disciples compound the elixir with their master, those who are to ingest it together should also withdraw, though their ears need not be sealed.\n\nEach must receive the method separately and perform distinct rites; they should not combine them. After I have spoken and the necessities of food and drink are met, I command one or two persons to come and receive blessings. Once they have received the blessings, after a while, I send them back to their dwelling, and then proceed to send off the spirits.\n\nIf one bears the True Forms Chart of the Five Peaks, a separate seat should be set below for it, and it should be worshipped orally, without written prayers—omitting this if one does not possess it. The chart one wears should be placed upon the sacrificial mat.\n\nOn the previous day, one should also visualize the guardian spirits of the Five Peaks, commanding them to gather the local spirits, sweep and purify the mountains and rivers, ensuring no nursing tigers, birthing beasts, filth, or malevolent creatures remain within the precincts, in preparation for the descent of the Heavenly Perfected. Fixing one’s intent, one invokes the chart and calls one or two persons to receive blessings, unsealing their ears. After they receive the blessings and depart, their ears should not be resealed.\n\nWhen the sacrifice is complete, the spirits are sent off as dawn approaches. At the initial invocation, one should repeatedly beseech, entreating the Perfected Ones and Divine Lords for their grace. Upon completion, perform nine bows, nine kowtows, and nine self-strikes once more.\n\nOn the night of the sacrifice, there will surely be auspicious omens: the mountain trembling, the sound of thunder, clouds gathering, or a great mist enveloping the forest. These are signs of the descent of the numinous powers of Heaven and Earth upon the grand sacrifice—such manifestations are inevitable.\n\nHaving chosen an auspicious day for purification and elixir-compounding, one should seek a spacious cavern within a great cliff to accommodate all necessities. If no cavern is available, within a secluded area among the four mountains, amidst dense woods far from human habitation, construct a hut four or five *zhang* in length. Erect sturdy barriers and fences to shield against wind and rain, performing the sacrifice beneath the hut. If rain falls after the fire is lit, construct a temporary shelter to cover it, easily dismantled when the rain ceases.\n\nIn years of frequent rain, with high mountains and deep forests often shrouded in clouds, if labor is insufficient to build a rain shelter, one may simply remain within the cavern or hut—this is also suitable and free from concern about Heaven’s scrutiny.\n\nOne should also choose a site near water; without water, drawing and fetching become difficult. If near a mountain stream, where sacrifices are offered and the elixir is refined, have the disciples of one’s household widely disseminate warnings: travelers in the mountains should not approach the site where the *Taiqing Golden Liquor Divine Elixir Scripture* is kept—this is most proper. Only when needed should items from the altar be taken.\n\nThese preparations should be made before entering the mountain retreat. After seven days of purification, gather all required items and place them upon the altar, covering it with a crimson cloth nine *chi* in length. Burn incense, bow twice, and face the altar. At midnight, begin the sacrifice and use the items. Place the crimson cloth behind the sacrificial seat.\n\nOn that day, the host and assistants should prepare together, selecting fine incense to offer. The sacrificial food should not be shared with others; only those who join in the purification and elixir-compounding may partake as provisions. The quantity of raw and cooked offerings should be arranged thoughtfully, adjusted according to one’s means—purity is the sole requirement.\n\nIf disciples compound the elixir together, they should jointly prepare the sacrifice. The seating, cups, and plates should all be shared. The Six-One Mud may also be shared, but a large earthen crucible should be made. For every ten *jin* of cinnabar, five *jin* of realgar, and five *jin* of orpiment, one dose is prepared.",

The sacrificial provisions must then be abundant. If the offerings are too plentiful to be consumed, they may be prepared as dry rations for others, but these may only be distributed after the elixir is completed. Have the disciples in the household fast for three days before partaking. Those who have broken the fast need not be given the sacrificial food; they must fast again the following day.\n\nOn the *jiashen* day, kindle the fire beneath the crucible. If disciples compound the elixir together, each should observe the fast individually. During the fast, if one must leave to gather sacrificial items, they should bathe again upon returning, removing their garments to purify themselves. Even servants who are not participating should be restricted from entering or leaving, though they need not observe the fast. Select only those who are temperate, auspicious, and prudent, and have them also bathe and change their clothes.\n\nIf no true officials of the divine bureaucracy are present on the day of sacrifice, invoke the gods, officers, and soldiers from the talismanic registers to drive away tigers in lactation and impure beasts.

Lord Yin rendered it in Han characters, totaling five hundred and four words.\n\n**Method for Making Six-One Mud:**\nTake equal parts of alum, halite, brine, and *yushi* (reputed stone), and fire them for twenty days. Then take left-facing oyster shells, red halloysite, and talc—seven ingredients in total, in equal parts—and adjust the quantity according to the size of the earthen crucible. Use this to coat the ears of the crucible, grinding it ten thousand times. Place it in an iron vessel and fire it intensely for nine days and nine nights until the medicine turns red. Grind it again ten thousand times, sift it finely, and mix it with pure, strong vinegar to form a mud, called Six-One Mud.\n\nTake two red earthen crucibles, sized according to need, and coat both the inner and outer surfaces with Six-One Mud to a thickness of three *fen*. Dry them in the sun for ten days until thoroughly desiccated. Then take nine *jin* of mercury and one *jin* of lead, place them in the earthen crucible, and apply intense fire from dawn until the hour of *ri xia bu*. The essences of mercury and lead will emerge together like yellow gold, called *xuanhuang* (Mysterious Yellow), also known as *feiqing* (Flying Light) or *feiliu* (Flying Flow).\n\nTake fine lead powder, fire it in an iron vessel until it turns golden, and combine it with *xuanhuang* in equal parts. Mix with *zuowei* (left-flavored substance) and grind ten thousand times until it becomes mud. Coat the inner and outer surfaces of the two crucibles, top and bottom, to a thickness of three *fen*. Dry them in the sun for ten days, ensuring they do not crack from dryness; apply mud by hand to protect them as needed.\n\nTake ten *jin* of refined cinnabar, five *jin* of realgar, and five *jin* of orpiment, grind them together, and sift finely. Adjust the quantity according to need—no less than five *jin* and no more than a hundred *jin*—and place it in the earthen crucible. Seal the seams with Six-One Mud to a thickness of one *fen* and dry in the sun for ten days. Then take finely sifted white tile shards, mix them with vinegar, one *jin* of realgar, and one *jin* of oyster shells, and grind them twenty thousand times until they form a mud.",

For every ten *jin* of cinnabar, five *jin* of realgar, and five *jin* of orpiment, one dose is prepared.",

      "translated_text": "Further reinforce the sealing mud on top, ensuring a thickness of three *fen*, and dry in the sun for ten days. If cracks appear upon heating, half of the divine essence will escape and fly away. Should fine cracks develop, apply Six-One Mud again to seal them. Inspect closely.\n\nFirst, place the crucible upon an iron *nao* and secure it. Then, using horse dung, burn the area five *cun* from the crucible’s sides for nine days and nine nights. If horse dung is unavailable, rice husks may be used instead. Next, apply fire to the base for nine days and nine nights. Then, encircle the crucible’s midsection with fire for another nine days and nine nights. In all, thirty-six days will complete the elixir.\n\nCool for one day, then open to inspect: the cinnabar should have ascended to the upper crucible, resembling shooting stars or the moon’s descent, its nine-colored clouds embroidered in splendor, like congealed frost or piled snow, its sword-like rays and emerald radiance unfolding in eight directions, its net-like brilliance swirling in abundance. Its vapor resembles purple blossoms illumined by the sun, its hue like azure skies reflecting rosy clouds, its layered towers and winding corridors resplendent with luxuriant beauty.\n\nSweep the elixir with the feathers of a three-year-old red male parrot, calling it the \"Flower of Golden Liquid.\" If the elixir fails to form, repeat the firing as before. Another thirty-six days—seventy-two in total—will leave no reason for failure. The key lies in regulating the fire with timely precision; uneven heat may complete the process in thirty-six days without need for refiring. If the crucible cracks, the spirit will depart, and consumption will yield no benefit. The sealing mud should protrude slightly by three *fen* for best results. Adjust the fire’s intensity as needed, gauging by intuition.\n\nAt dawn, bathe, fumigate your robes, and bow twice facing east. With heart fixed upon the celestial perfected and the lords divine, kneel and ingest the elixir in grains the size of millet or small beans. The superior adept ascends as an immortal in seven days, the middling in seventy, while the ignorant may require a year. If sincerity is absolute, the fastidiousness of the retreat flawless, and the dose three *dao-gui* measures, one may ascend as an immortal at once. Yet some Daoists, fearing imperfection, dare consume only three *dao-gui* to witness the divine elixir’s potent verification.\n\nUpon first taking three *dao-gui*, one will briefly die for half a day before reviving, as if awakening from sleep. Thereafter, resume consumption in millet-sized doses to discern the timeframe of one’s spiritual capacity. Should death occur within three days, administer a single grain of the elixir the size of a small bean by placing it in the mouth, and life will return instantly.\n\nTake one *zhu* of the divine elixir and cast it into a *jin* of mercury, then apply fire to transmute it into gold—though this gold is not for consumption. Instead, forge it into a tube to contain the elixir. Wrap the elixir in an embroidered pouch as recorded in the *Scripture of the Golden Liquid Divine Elixir*.\n\nFirst, prepare a strong, clear vinegar—weak vinegar is unusable. Once clarified to a volume of one *hu*, transfer it to a vessel and place it in a cool, clean location. Seal the vessel with mud, leaving a half-*cun* opening at the base. Weigh nine *liang* of gold with an ancient steelyard and immerse it in the vinegar for a hundred days to prepare it for mixing with Six-One Mud, calling it \"Golden Liquid.\" After twenty-one days in the brew, the gold will soften like dough, pliable at will, its essence dissolving into the liquid to form divine *qi*. To retrieve the gold after a hundred days, first grind three *liang* of *ling* stone into powder and mix it with three *dou* of cold water. Gradually extract the gold, then let it settle overnight to restore its original hardness.\n\nWhen first removing the gold from the vessel, do not stir it by hand, lest it soften and crumble. If gold is unavailable, it may be borrowed. For larger earthen crucibles, increase the vinegar volume beyond one *hu* proportionally, adjusting the gold’s weight accordingly.\n\nGrind cinnabar, realgar, and orpiment separately, sift through fine silk, and blend them before storing in a sealed vessel. Ensure the vessel’s mouth is as hot as fire.\n\nTake twenty *jin* of mica powder, grind it finely, and spread it on the ground where it may receive the sky’s light, leaving an opening in the center. Place ten *jin* of mulberry leaves from the *Scripture of the Golden Liquid Divine Elixir* (Volume One) atop the mica. At dusk, sprinkle three *dou* of clear water over the leaves. Once done, secretly remove the cinnabar, expose the vessel on the mulberry leaves, and uncover it. At dawn, return the cinnabar to its lid and store it indoors. Cover the mulberry leaves with a mat on the ground.\n\nRepeat this for seven days, beginning on an *jiazi* purification day and concluding at dawn on *xinwei*. Thus, the Yellow Dragon’s mica-infused liquid will fully enter the cinnabar, as if heavenly rain descends to bathe it. Guard the cinnabar diligently, lest insects or impurities defile it. Each evening, turn the cinnabar to expose it anew to the sky and sun. Once complete, grind it ten thousand times and seal it tightly.\n\nOn an *jiashen* day, place the mixture into the earthen crucible, ensuring the tube is level and unobstructed—do not press it by hand, for compression hinders ascent.\n\nFor the ritual of reception, prepare one *dou* and eight *sheng* of fine clear wine, one *jin* of thousand-year *chen* (agarwood), and three *shui-ren* (foxnut seeds), all prepared according to proper method.",

mounds.\nThe yellow and red substances form in but a moment,\nYet their male and female essences scatter in wondrous disarray.\nThis can transform and summon the traveling kitchen,\nWhile spirit-people and jade maidens become my companions.\nMoving in and out without question, in harmony with Heaven’s tally,\nIts essence congeals like frost, adept at sinking and floating—\nYou must reverently await its visitation.\n\nThese sixty-three characters, originally obscure in ancient texts,\nWere revealed by Lord Yin to expound the Dao of the Golden Liquid’s Reverted Cinnabar.\n\nThe method employs a large copper cylinder,\nwith an opening two and a half inches wide,\nthe cylinder itself four-tenths of an inch thick and nine inches tall,\nusing two such cylinders.\nOne serves as a lid, five inches in height.\n\nPrepare one catty of refined *yushi* stone and half a catty of lead cinnabar.\nFirst, fire the *yushi* for twenty days,\nthen pound it ten thousand times.\nNext, place it in an iron vessel and subject it to fierce fire for nine days and nights,\nthen pound it again ten thousand times and sift it finely.\nMix it with pure bitter wine to a mud-like consistency,\nand coat the copper cylinder inside and out,\nensuring an even thickness of four-tenths of an inch—this is the first layer.\n\nFor the refinement method, repeat the process:\nTake the essence of realgar and orpiment,\nmix with pure wine, and coat both cylinders,\nmaking the layer half a tenth of an inch thick—this is the second layer.\n\nThe third layer is frost and snow.\nThe upper cylinder lid is coated in the same manner as the lower cylinder.\nFill the interior with frost and snow to a depth of one and a half inches,\nthen cover it with the upper cylinder lid.\nSeal the junction with red ochre and tile fragments,\ncoating it thoroughly to prevent leakage,\nfor if it leaks, the blossom essence will fly away.\nOnce sealed, coat it again,\nand place it in a clean, secluded spot to dry thoroughly.\nSet it in the center of a fire made of reed ash or horse dung,\nsecuring the cylinder firmly with an iron grate,\nelevated three inches from the ground.\nThe fire should be three inches from the cylinder on all sides—\nthis must be carefully and precisely observed.\n\nAfter ten days, move the fire two inches closer on all sides.\nAfter twenty days, move it one inch closer.\nBy the thirtieth day, the fire should surround the cylinder on all sides,\nreaching halfway up its height.\nAfter fifty days, it is called \"yellow gold.\"\nThis yellow gold is the divine medicine within,\ncapable of forming true gold.\n\nAfter another twenty days of firing, totaling seventy days,\nthe medicine is complete and named \"red gold.\"\nThis red gold is the divine medicine that can form true red gold,\ncalled the Golden Liquid’s Reverted Cinnabar.\n\nTo make yellow gold,\ntake one *zhū* of reverted cinnabar and place it in a catty of lead—\ntrue gold will form.\nAlternatively, first melt the lead in a vessel,\nthen add a *daogui* of the red medicine while observing.\nFive-colored radiance and purple clouds will swirl in lush brilliance,\nshifting between dark and yellow like celestial clouds—\nthis is called \"purple gold,\" the marvel of the Dao.\n\nThe purple frost on the lid is called \"divine cinnabar.\"\nFor consumption, blend it with dragon’s fat gloss and jujube paste,\nforming pills the size of soybeans.\nTake one pill at dawn with well-water,\nincreasing to one pill daily.\nAfter seventy days,\nthe Six Ding and Six Jia spirit-immortals and jade maidens will attend you,\nguiding and escorting you front and back.\nAfter a hundred days,\nyou will wander in rapture, moving freely through time and space.\nAfter a hundred and fifty days,\njade maidens will serve you day and night,\nyour form transformed to the hue of true jade,\ngaining mastery over transformation and freedom.\nYou will constantly receive massages and summon treasures for the traveling kitchen.\n\nGold governs the flesh and muscles,\nwhile reverted cinnabar governs the blood and meridians,\nenabling the spirit to ascend and descend without limit,\nmoving in and out without hindrance,\nand meeting the celestial spirits of the sun and moon.\nEach morning, rinse your mouth with the Jade Pond’s nectar,\nkeeping it ever full and overflowing.\nThe jade nectar is the fluid in the mouth,\ngoverning bones, marrow, sinews, and flesh,\nenhancing one’s essence and qi to rise,\nbanishing fatigue and weariness,\nbestowing longevity and enduring vision.\n\nDragon’s fat gloss is the dew on mulberry leaves.\nAt dawn, gently wipe the dew from the leaves with silk,\nboil it with large dried jujubes,\nand blend the clear juice with equal parts sheep marrow,\nsimmering it into a jujube paste.\nThis can also be taken long-term,\nfilling the body and enhancing one’s complexion.\n\nThe copper cylinder can also be made larger.\nThe dimensions described earlier suffice for one dose of reverted cinnabar—\nadjustments may be made as needed.\n\n**Method for Making Jujube Paste:**\nFor one dose, use three *dǒu* of large dried jujubes and six *dǒu* of water,\nboiling until the jujubes are soft.\nAdd another three *dǒu* of water and boil again.\nIn total, use nine *dǒu* of water,\nthen strain the liquid and let it settle,\nyielding three *dǒu* of clear juice.\nAdd six *dǒu* of sheep marrow to the juice and simmer gently\nuntil it reaches the consistency of malt sugar.\nIf sheep marrow is unavailable, sheep fat may be used instead.\n\n**Method for Extracting the Essence of Realgar and Orpiment:**\nTake one catty each of realgar and orpiment,\npound them finely ten thousand times,\nand sift thoroughly.\nUse Six-One Mud to seal an earthen crucible,\nplacing the powders inside and sealing the top.\nThen take newly fired tile fragments,\nmix them with mud, and seal the crucible to prevent qi leakage.\nDry it in the sun until it cracks, then seal it again.\nNext, use reed firewood to burn the crucible’s base and sides\nfor three days and nights.\nIf the essence rises like frost and snow, it is ready.\nFor larger cylinders, the frost and snow from the crucible lid may also be used.\n\n**Method for Making Frost and Snow:**\nTake equal parts *cengqing*, *yushi*, sulfur, halite, *ningshuishi*, red ochre, and mercury,\npound them together ten thousand times without sifting.\nMix with pure wine until moist and pliable.\nPlace in an earthen crucible and seal with mud,\nfollowing the same method as for the divine cinnabar’s earthen crucible.",

      "translated_text": "Again apply red ochre and white tile fragments to seal and secure it, ensuring no leakage—every step must match the previous sealing without deviation. Burn with reed firewood beneath and around it for four days and four nights, slightly intensifying the heat. When the divine essence rises like frost and snow, use the feather of a three-year-old male parrot to sweep it off, calling it *Frost and Snow*. You may add three more ingredients—cinnabar, realgar, and orpiment—combining them in equal parts with the previous seven to make ten in total, naming it *Golden Essence Congealed Frost and Snow*. Thus is the Way of the Returning Elixir complete.\n\nThe Returning Elixir will not form without prior ritual offering. Fast for three days, then present five *dou* of clear wine and ten *jin* of white dried meat to sacrifice to the Spirit of the Great Turtle. As for the copper cylinder, reeds are used because the Celestial Steed’s essence demands them. The fire must be kindled with horse dung, though reed fire is difficult to manage. When refining the essence of realgar and orpiment, or when burning *Frost and Snow*, reed fire is appropriate—unlike the fire used for the copper cylinder.\n\n*Golden Essence Congealed Frost* may be ingested to grant immortality, but it is not the same as *Frost and Snow*, which is unsuitable for placement inside the copper cylinder. The ingredients for *Frost and Snow*—*cengqing*, halite, and *ningshuishi*—are all precious medicines and cannot be substituted. Without genuine materials, the medicine will not form.\n\nThe *Divine Elixir of Golden Liquid from the Great Clarity* comprises five hundred seventy-six characters in lines of seven. The *Golden Liquid* section contains five hundred four characters, and the *Returning Elixir* sixty-three. Master Zheng says: The transformations of immortals—whether ascending or descending—are difficult to discuss in terms of mundane verification. Truly, they are not attainable by ordinary means. The divine transformations recorded in the alchemical classics are grounded in empirical proof, which is why the Celestial Worthies have concealed this Way. The two truths of the real and the apparent are inseparable, yet the foolish do not reflect and thus perceive it as distant. The enlightened, however, can grasp it in an instant, so the texts are kept secret only from those who fail to comprehend. How could such wisdom be debated in scriptures?\n\nWithout a sincere aspiration for immortality, the teachings are not transmitted. Thus, the Lady of Supreme Perfection once told Master Ma: \"Even after accompanying Anqi for a short time, his methods could be passed down. But those who seek shallow or hasty results will find the gates tightly sealed. Even true immortals guard their treasures so closely—how could such knowledge befit the unworthy?\" Lord Yin, skilled in writing, sealed his texts and entrusted them to the Five Peaks. If a devotee of the Dao retreats into the mountains, refines their essence, and reveres the highest flavors, those who persist in the Way will find the immortals themselves parting the stone cliffs to reveal their secrets. Without progressing step by step in the pursuit of the Dao, the secret essentials of the alchemical classics will remain forever hidden in the towering peaks.\n\nMasters Ma and Yin were not merely immortals. They observed the celestial patterns, foretold the rise and fall of nations, discerned the waxing and waning of destinies, and verified what was yet to come. Their boundless compassion nurtured all living beings, and their profound knowledge established the names of all things. Aligning with the sagely and illuminating the myriad beings, they were truly radiant—truly divine.\n\nIn the past, I heard from true immortals who transmitted these teachings, and their words were filled with admiration. Their instructions on actual refinement were consistent across different masters—how could the pure and true teachings be allowed to fade without being recorded? Thus, I have written down the divine insights of these two masters, along with the accounts passed down since the reign of Emperor Ling of Han, and appended them to the alchemical classics. May those who walk the Dao draw inspiration from them.\n\nDisciple Ge Hong says: In the first year of *Taixing* of the Jin, the year *wuyin*, on the sixth day of the tenth month, former Prefect of Nanhai, Bao Shuo, told me: \"On the twenty-second day of the eighth month of that year, while traveling in the capital, I was returning to the river when, riding a horse, I encountered a youth of sixteen or seventeen, fair of face, on the northern road of Jiangshan in Jiankang. We walked together for several *li*. I have studied the Dao, observed celestial signs, and am versed in various arts. I saw this person walking slowly yet moving swiftly.",

      "translated_text": "Ge Hong, still mounted, spurred his horse to a gallop, yet could only just keep pace—gradually, the youth pulled ahead. Marveling at his extraordinary swiftness, Ge asked: \"Where are you bound, that you travel so swiftly? Though your steps seem unhurried, you move with such speed. You must be one who walks the Dao.\"\n\nThe youth halted and replied: \"I am the transcendent Yin Changsheng, sent by the Most High to the Red City. You appear to have a seeking heart, which is why you have encountered me.\"\n\nGe Hong, well-versed in Daoist scriptures, knew of old that Lord Yin had attained transcendence—this must be he. He dismounted at once, bowed deeply, and exchanged courtesies, though he had no time to speak further.\n\nLord Yin said: \"This place will see, in ten years’ time, great turmoil and war, with blood soaking the fields. Why do you seek life here?\"\n\nAfter some time in conversation, they parted. Lord Yin told Bao Shuo: \"Though you have long yearned for the Dao, your refinement has only just begun, and your years are already advanced. Yet if you strive as a master craftsman, I foresee you may still attain deliverance from the world. The highest method of transcendence for those who attain the Dao in old age is *corpse-liberation*. The superior form uses a blade, the inferior, bamboo or wood.\"\n\nBao Shuo asked: \"In corpse-liberation with a blade—does the blade harm the body?\"\n\nLord Yin replied: \"Not as you imagine. When we speak of blade corpse-liberation, the blade stands in for the person, placed in the coffin to satisfy the emotions of descendants and sever worldly ties. With the *Mysterious Yin Birth Talisman* of the Most High, one inscribes the blade’s edge on both sides, using divine elixir as ink. In an instant, the inscription forms a likeness of the person—face and features as they were—who then dies upon the bed. The true self departs at once, never to return home. The family, believing the blade to be the body, mourns for a morning and buries it. The inferior form, using bamboo or wood, follows the same method of inscribing talismans with divine elixir.\"\n\nHaving imparted these talismanic writings to Bao Shuo, Lord Yin’s words came to an end. He lingered a while, then vanished without a trace. Looking up toward the mountains and marshes, Bao saw only a flock of cranes rising from the grass—several in number—soaring southeast, disappearing over the peaks into the clouds, never to be seen again.\n\nLater, discussing the rise and fall of the Jin, he told Bao Shuo: \"After this *jiashen* year, in the *yiyou* and *bingxu* years, two rulers will pass, and rebels will fill the land. When misfortune reaches its nadir, the dynasty will nearly collapse, leaving but one in ten thousand. If you cultivate the arts of the Huai and Si rivers, first securing a strategic stronghold—occupying the region north of Weiyang and west of Beihai—you will align above with the Dipper’s measure and below with earthly *qi*. From this time onward, beginning with the lands south of the Yangtze, the dynasty may endure sixty-six years, until the *jiaxu* period, when its mandate will end. From the struggles at the capital’s gates to the *jiashen* year, the span is fixed. Calamity hastens ruin; blessings and exorcisms may prolong it, but when the breath of destiny is exhausted, all will converge in that year. From now to *jiashen*, precisely seventy-six years remain.\n\nThe mandate of emperors is decreed by Heaven. Your line will see ten generations before its end. The Xia’s Shaokang, the Shang’s Gaozong, the Zhou’s Pingwang, and the Han’s Guangwu—all serve as precedents. Each followed Heaven’s measure. By this reckoning, the Jin’s mandate should also span ten generations, and indeed, it may yet prevail, for I have spoken of this before the celestial courts.\n\nNow, a ghostly lawsuit has arisen: Emperor Wen of Jin’s bloodshed has been unceasing, and his grievance has reached the Heavenly Bureau. If the Most High adjudicates the wrong, the Jin may yet preserve its lineage. If the Most High dispels the ghost and entrusts the mandate to another, then from Emperor Wu onward—skipping Emperors Hui and Min—the dynasty will still endure ten generations.\n\nThe Jin’s fate now rests in the celestial courts, much like the case of Zhao Jianzi long ago. The ghost of Emperor Wen continues his suit even now. Once, Zhao Jianzi dreamed of Dukes Yin and Xian, following them to the court of the Heavenly Emperor. The two dukes argued their case before the Emperor, and Jianzi, unable to prevail, was handed over to them. Duke Yin seized Jianzi’s head, while Duke Xian raised his sword to strike. Jianzi’s head fell to the ground, but he retrieved it and reattached it—though not quite right. A shaman from Cenyang, standing beside the Heavenly Emperor, saw this and helped adjust it.\n\nAwakening displeased, Jianzi went out walking. On the road, he met a man leading a white dog. The man stepped aside into a thicket of brambles, where the dog’s leash tangled in the thorns. The shaman turned back to free it, but the thorns clung to the dog’s head, preventing its escape. The shaman glanced at Jianzi, who recognized him—his clothing and face were just as in the dream.\n\nJianzi asked: 'I feel I have met you before. Where did we see each other?'\n\nThe man replied: 'I am the shaman of Cenyang. Yesterday, I stood before the Heavenly Emperor and saw the two dukes accuse you. You argued your case but could not prevail, and the Emperor handed you over to them. Duke Yin seized your head, Duke Xian drew his sword, and your head fell to the ground. You retrieved it and reattached it, but it was not quite right—so I helped adjust it. We met just yesterday, and today you have forgotten?'\n\nJianzi said: 'So it was. What can be done now? Can I still act to change this?'\n\nThe shaman replied: 'It cannot be done. Your fate has already been severed above; it cannot be restored.'\n\nJianzi said: 'But you helped me reattach my head yesterday. Surely there is some way to aid me? Now that we have met by chance, it must be a sign of fortune. I beg you to deliver me.'\n\nThe shaman whistled for a long while, then said: 'Very well.'\"",

      "translated_text": "Now beholding the realm, those who have turned their backs on the Son of Heaven of Zhou—none surpass Qi in severity, and the Heavenly Emperor’s wrath against Qi is likewise most severe. You, Great King, may represent the Son of Heaven, petition for troops to punish Qi, and the Heavenly Emperor will surely rejoice. He will extend your fate, granting you twenty-five more years. This alone remains as a means to prolong your life.”\n\nJianzi, overjoyed at these words, promptly returned to memorialize the Son of Heaven and request troops to punish Qi. The Son of Heaven assented and dispatched forces with Zhao to attack Qi. Jianzi, acting on the Son of Heaven’s mandate, commanded the feudal lords to join the expedition, assembling at the Yellow River to offer sacrifices to the River God. Jianzi knelt in reverence, striking his chest with both hands, and prayed: “By the mandate of Heaven today, I execute the traitorous and punish the guilty, achieving my aim against Qi.” Jianzi then journeyed to Zhao and served the River God with devotion. The campaign indeed crushed Qi, and Qi once more offered tribute to the Son of Heaven. Thus, Jianzi gained an extension of twenty-five years to his life. Such is the way of mending what is severed through merit and virtue.\n\nThe words of the Lord of the Netherworld were as clear as this. Later, in the second year of *Taining* (324 CE), the year *jiashen*, the rebellion of the great general Wang Dun indeed erupted.

      "translated_text": "The Bao clan, admiring Hong’s reverence for the Dao’s savor and his prudence in speech, shared these words with him, strictly enjoining him to commit them to memory and never divulge them. Even among his own disciples and kin, none were privy to this knowledge. He guarded it in utmost secrecy, sealing his lips. The Lord of the Netherworld told Bao: \"You are trusted by the age; you may also make the present sovereign aware of the world’s turning fortunes. If he secures his embattled lands, he may yet preserve and protect, though wounded, he shall not fall. This, too, is a boon of ruler and minister’s merit. You must act on your own. You harbor the art of divining omens and portents—use it to know, but do not speak of having discussed these matters with me. Moreover, you must extol virtue to the times, making affairs subtle yet manifest, principles hidden yet discernible. Do not be blunt and unguarded, lest you compound others’ calamities and transgressions.\"\n\nThat year, Bao submitted a memorial to Emperor Yuan, expounding the essentials of the dynasty’s rise and fall, the dynamics of suppression and prevention. His memorial wove together astrological prognostication and the import of ancient and modern times—all drawn from the Lord of the Netherworld’s words. Yet where it spoke of opportunities lengthening and eras stretching far, this was Bao’s own embellishment, not the original substance of the Lord’s discourse. The memorial contained other matters, which Emperor Yuan kept secret. Still, he privately noted the vast span of years described and suspected Bao of excess. He once discreetly showed the memorial to Minister of State Wang Dao, who remarked: \"This is turning hundreds into thousands. You ever loathe the near and delight in the distant, shun the short and praise the long. Even in a minister’s words, though free of concealment or flattery, one should not strike the heart so directly. It is like medicine to cure illness: one must first divide the dose to remedy distress. If one were to take the whole draught at once in haste, the ears could not bear the trial, and the condition would surely worsen.\"\n\nEmperor Yuan fell silent. Hong once glimpsed Bao’s memorial in passing but had no time to read it. He copied down its words, which bore strong evidence. Only those keen to subtle signs could grasp the depth of its purport. Of late, with spies proliferating within and without, the search for this text proved futile—perhaps lost to banditry and palace fires. Hong wished to see this memorial again, not for its purport, but to know the appointed time of peace or ruin, for he prized the Lord of the Netherworld’s parting words.\n\nThe Lord of the Netherworld had long departed, yet later appeared in person to Bao. His discourse was subtle and wondrous, his profound insight clear as a mirror; thus, it is recounted here. After Bao’s death, he was temporarily interred at Shizigang. When bandits raided and opened his tomb, they found only a single broadsword in the coffin, with no trace of clothing or bones. The bandits also heard the sounds of men and horses around the tomb, and in terror, they fled, leaving the sword untouched. Later, Bao’s family reburied him, interring only the great sword. Thus, Bao must have attained the Lord of the Netherworld’s method of *daoshi* through the sword. Perhaps he sought the Dao and its scriptures.\n\nHere ends the middle scroll of *The Divine Elixir of Golden Liquor*.\nHere begins the lower scroll of *The Divine Elixir of Golden Liquor*.\n*Preface and Account by Baopuzi*",

      "translated_text": "Ge Hong says: I have seen those who compile accounts of the South’s similarities and differences, recording the strange life of foreign lands. Though their works roughly approximate the truth, their travels have been too shallow to properly discern the marvels of distant regions or inscribe the wonders of exotic lands for our eyes. Thus, I have expanded upon their records, allowing their scattered observations to be measured and their broad visions to be clarified. I have documented their named domains so that north and south may be precisely distinguished, and east and west no longer confused.\n\nYet since the primordial chaos divided and the Two Modes split apart, beneath the heavens’ canopy and upon the earth’s expanse, within the Four Seas and beyond the Eight Wastes, the vastness stretches so far that none can fathom its bounds. All that yin and yang mold, all that sun and moon illuminate—from the verdant growth of plain matter to the crawling of gnats and wriggling of worms—abound in such multitude that none can enumerate them in full.\n\nIn ancient times, Yu governed the floods for thirteen years, traversing the Nine Provinces, summoning the remote and essential, and only then distinguishing their directions and examining their records for discrepancies. Yet even what his feet trod and his eyes beheld was but a fraction. Of all that the dark and yellow encompass, of all that the Six Directions contain, he could grasp no more than one percent.\n\nMoreover, the *Book of Zou Yang* states: \"The present Nine Provinces are not the world’s true provinces, but merely one of nine. Within the Four Extremes, there are eight more.\" Scholars of this age dismiss this as empty talk. In my youth, I aspired to study the Dao and journey beyond the distant. Once, during a brief respite, I traveled south on a journey. Initially, I thought only to observe Jiaoling. Taking advantage of an opportunity, I reached Funan.\n\nFunan spans over a thousand *li*, its populace numbering in the hundreds of millions. It embraces mountains and borders the sea, its borders vast and remote. I assumed it to be the southernmost land, the limit of the world. Yet when the summer months arrived in the Central Realm and the balmy winds stirred, there came those from even farther south, arriving like rivers flowing. I inquired about their lands and examined their customs. They spoke of great nations like Funan—ten or more—extending from Tianzhu and Yuezhi. Beyond the lands of Dainan and Fulin, each spans thirty thousand *li*. Among them, smaller states lie scattered in countless numbers. Though their names and locations have origins and ends, their peoples and customs differ so widely that one realizes how vast the world truly is. Even sages and worthies, though they set their minds on distant travels, cannot exhaust its wonders—how much less can vulgar scholars, who doubt without cause? As for Zouzi’s claim, it is not mere exaggeration.\n\nYet what I have heard suggests that these lands alone surpass the Nine Provinces tenfold. As for what is merely rumored and not yet verified, how can their extent be measured? The expanse is boundless, its limits unknown—how can one arbitrarily fix their number at eight? The ancient sages took the Divine Continent of China and matched the Nine Provinces to the Eight Trigrams. Above, they aligned with the celestial pole; below, they centered the earth’s core. Thus, the Nine Provinces are here. The rest, though vast, are not part of this scheme.\n\nAs for their strange mountains and wondrous seas, their bizarre creatures and exotic species, their rare treasures and splendid objects—so dazzling and extraordinary that they fill the eyes and ears, startling the heart and shocking the mind—what I have seen but never heard of is too strange and irregular to be fully recorded. These are mere extravagances for external display, not what one seeking life’s cultivation should pursue.\n\nFrom Funan and Dunxun to Linyi, Dubo, and Wulun—within these five lands—are found cinnabar, sulfur, azurite, quartz, and the minerals from which elixirs for transcendent ingestion and medicines for longevity are derived. The stones that preserve life are sought without fail, yet I cannot enumerate them all by name. There, cinnabar is as common as tiles in the east, and red mercury lies underfoot like potter’s clay. Paired fish cover the ground in such abundance that none can measure it.\n\nYet these five lands do not know the methods of ingestion or the path to prolonged life. They value useless trinkets to fill their realms, abandoning divine stones without refinement. They compete for carved and polished goods, scorning the medicines of flowing cinnabar. They do not refine or consume them, leaving their true essence to endure for eons, mixed and unrefined, their wondrous properties unmanifested. What I have witnessed and verified is indeed clear.\n\nNow, in my sixtieth year, though I still chew herbs and woods, I know that only the efficacy of elixirs is essential. Yet time slips away, and contentment remains elusive. Death looms ever closer. A petty county’s rank—how could I covet such honor? My refusal to decline this post is but to harness the people’s strength and seek a path forward. I intend to linger in the cinnabar fields and cultivate the hidden arts. This long-held aspiration and humble wish have now converged. I bid farewell to the grave mounds—I shall depart.\n\nThose who study the Dao and seek life are often poor scholars. The wealthy, indulging in fine foods and ease, are ensnared by sensual pleasures. To humble themselves, curb desires, and abandon passions for joy—how few can endure the toil and humiliation of seeking a master, bearing hardship and suffering? Not one in a thousand. Moreover, those who wish to cultivate immortality cannot ascend without elixirs.\n\nI was born in Yangzhou, and poverty has followed me. The eight minerals are prized, yet I have no means to obtain them. To demand them unjustly is unheard of; to rely on hired labor is impractical. My constitution has long been weak and frail. If I were to undertake this, my heart would be burdened. Even if I were granted a prefecture, I could never gather the necessary resources. Thus, the Dao often clings to poverty, while wealth pursues nobility.\n\nFurthermore, the world’s troubles remain unresolved. Heat and cold afflict my heart. I did not foresee fate’s decree or the descent of calamity. With turmoil rising, I glance at my limbs and constantly fear the blade’s edge. Trembling in dread, how could I find time to seek medicines and nurture my life?\n\nNow, though I hold these elixir scriptures, I have no means to apply them. It is like offering a dragon’s abyss sword in a butcher’s shop or adorning a dog with luminous pearls. One values the substance but does not know how to employ it—is this not lamentable? I shall now explain these truths to my disciples; let them all heed them.",

      "translated_text": "A person parched with great thirst forever longs to stand by the long river. One ravenous with hunger yearns to dwell in farm and garden. For those who wish to study the Dao, why not embrace the sacred formulas and wander their lands—what worry then for the scarcity of cinnabar and minerals? Is it that the mind’s strength is not gathered? Why then halt in lands of noble strife, settling the body in realms of contention, sharing in their exhaustion?\n\nFew know me, thus what I possess is precious. It is fitting to distance oneself from human affairs and avoid the inner chambers, to sever the clamor and tread the cinnabar mounds. When zithers and lutes play among the horses’ bridles, how can one discern their proper tones? Those who do not value the arts of elixirs do not value what I undertake. Thus, I may secure what I cultivate, my heart free from ceaseless dread, cherishing what I savor without toil or deference. Is this not to fulfill principle within while appearing foolish without?\n\nMoreover, in the vast southern reaches, famed mountains stretch unbroken. Below, hidden caverns mirror the depths of Mount Huo; above, their peaks rival the azure clouds. Fire-states blaze fiercely, fragrant arrays perfume the air—are the blessed lands solely confined to the outskirts of Yang and Chu? Yet the south extends beyond the Four Seas, and the sages of old who recorded the names of mountains inscribed only what lay within their domains, omitting what lay beyond.\n\nThe elixir scriptures speak of attainment and ingestion, of the proof of ascension to heaven, as the immortals’ traditions of the Eight Distant Realms describe—a mere household’s courtyard. Yet these five lands are all within reach of human travel; how can they be deemed remote? Thus, I do not disdain their distance but yearn for their realms, nor shrink from their remoteness but resolve to reach their lands.\n\nShould heaven’s decree not extend my years and the elixir remain unperfected, I shall reckon by fate’s portion and cultivate the numinous arts. By abiding in principle, I may summon flying frost and radiant splendor, dark clouds rising on all sides—this too is diligent service, and heaven may yet aid me.\n\nLife knows no noble or base; each must face death. To dispel the Three Corpses, guard essence and preserve qi, restrain the hun and nurture the spirit, to seek the numinous savor—if life cannot be attained, then at least one does not lose the common fate of death. It is like the many who cast lines and hooks, scattering bait across broad waters to catch fish—who can know who will strike first? Or like a thousand hounds chasing a hare, where only some will seize it. Thus, the end of fate’s span is even what emperors cannot evade.\n\nNow, let me measure by fate’s portion and align with the expected gains and losses. To be reduced to ashes on the long road, I accept it as sweetly as water-chestnut greens. For I hold fast to the Dao with sincerity, my cinnabar heart steadfast within. Though Su Qin and Zhang Yi were to reappear, Chen Ping and Li Yiji to revive, and they sought to persuade me with schemes, seizing the moment—exalting glory and splendor as foremost, their eloquence lush and ornate, their words cascading—still, I would flare with indignation, towering above those two, not deigning even to smile. With a single word, I would break them. My heart is like bedrock, unshaken by you; my resolve is adamantine, unsevered by you. My essential words are spent.\n\nOne with such resolve and sentiment may yet move the myriad spirits to pity, and perhaps I shall attain the transformation of the cicada’s molt. After a hundred years or more, I may turn to look back, my face restored to youth, to show the unbelievers. Yet I fear that by then, the skeptics will have long since crumbled to dust, no longer able to dispute what I once declared. These words may seem laughable—yet perhaps they are not.\n\nNow, I record the lands of life-elixirs, chronicling the outer realms, and append my foolish thoughts to the *Golden Liquid*. If these treasures remain hidden in secrecy, my words shall endure. Thus, the fox’s den beneath the royal city goes unassailed, the field mouse clinging to the temple wall remains undug, like the mosquito riding the swan to soar the dark peaks.\n\nHere, I bind my meager words to the true scriptures, seeking to preserve them. Let my disciples broaden their seeing and hearing. The words of Wan of Pu may be chosen even in the grand ancestral temple; the aspirations of a madman may yet align with the times. A general’s command may be overturned, but the will of a common man cannot be defied.\n\nI bow twice before the vermilion gates and take eternal leave. My back turns to the pines of the grave mounds, my heart conceals itself from the vulgar. People cannot understand me, nor can I understand them. Facing a wall without self-awareness—after the fish and turtles have had their fill, is this not pitiable? People see me as mad; I see them as insects. To whom can I declare the workings of fate’s measure?\n\nLet future gentlemen each seek their own virtue and deeds, not distinguishing intent by mere peepholes. My journey proceeds slowly; I set my boat upon the vast river. Departing from Xianglin, I turn toward the Winnowing Basket and away from the Celestial Sieve, riding the wind and following the current, swift as lightning or shooting stars. Day and night, I do not pause; the days accumulate, doubling into ten-day spans. At last, I reach Funan, where kings and lords rule, its lands vast, spanning ten thousand li as its borders. To the north, it borders Linyi; to the south, it encloses Dianxun. To the left, it draws Du Bo; to the right, it meets Wu Lun. Its people and things are countless, their gatherings like clouds. Suddenly, I find myself in a boundless expanse, a frontier without end, as if at the very edge of heaven. In these cinnabar caves, by the mid-summer month, when the moon’s cycle is at its guest, the triumphant winds blow northward, and the southern travelers arrive. With no means to ask of their origins, each clings to their homeland.\n\nI call this the southernmost pole, the far edge of the northern lands. When I inquire of the number of their states, they speak of Wuyuan, Gouzhi, Geying, Linyang, Jiachen, Shihan, Huli, Sidiao, Da Qin, Gunu, Chalao, Qibo, Zhinbin, Tianzhu, Yuezhi, Anxi, and Youqian—great lands numbering in the tens of thousands, smaller realms in the thousands. Beyond these, their roots are unknown.\n\nXianglin is today’s southern county. Long ago, Ma Yuan opened the southern frontier for the Han, establishing Xianglin County. Beyond Rinan by four or five hundred li, he erected two bronze pillars to mark the Han’s southern border. When the Later Han declined, foreign tribes invaded from without, seizing Xianglin and its bronze pillars. Now, they lie by the sea, some three hundred li south of Linyi, and have become the separate kingdom of Xitu. Its lands abound with cinnabar like dust.",

Trembling in dread, how could I find time to seek medicines and nurture my life?\n\nNow, though I hold these elixir scriptures, I have no means to apply them. It is like offering a dragon’s abyss sword in a butcher’s shop or adorning a dog with luminous pearls. One values the substance but does not know how to employ it—is this not lamentable? I shall now explain these truths to my disciples; let them all heed them.",

      "translated_text": "Departing from Shouling浦 in Rinan, sailing due south across the sea, one thus turns one’s back to the Chen star and faces the Ji star. Sailing day and night without cease for over ten days, one reaches Funan. Funan lies over three thousand li southwest of Linyi. It established itself as a kingdom, and all its tributary states acknowledge its ruler. The king of the greatest state is titled *paodao*, while the kings of lesser states are titled *positan*. The chieftains and the king’s chief ministers are all called *Kunlun*. Funan’s lands abound with cinnabar and precious stones. From Funan north to Linyi is three thousand li, a region rich and fertile, with plentiful cinnabar, realgar, and sulfur. Dianxun lies four or five thousand li south of Funan and was originally a separate kingdom. Fan Tan, a former king of Funan, subdued it through valor and strategy, and it now belongs to Funan. Its lands produce iron. To its south lie the kingdoms of Dukun, Bisong, and Gouzhi, all of which Fan Tan conquered in his campaigns—hence the name *Han Dianxun*. Dianxun is twenty thousand li from Rinan, while Funan is seemingly no more than three thousand seven or eight hundred li from Linyi. How is this known? When ships depart from the mouth of Shouling浦, with favorable winds they sail day and night without furling their sails for fifteen days before reaching Dianxun. In a single day and night, they cover two thousand li.\n\nOne may ask: \"Today, the towering junks of the Yangtze, with their broad sails, drift downstream with the current and a following wind, yet travel no more than three hundred li in a day. You now speak of sea voyages covering three thousand li day and night—is this not an exaggeration?\" I reply: \"In the past, I repeatedly questioned sailors about this. When their ships hoist four sails, forming a canopy like clouds, and catch the wind, they test their speed by casting an object into the water. In the time it takes to inhale and exhale once, the object has passed a hundred paces. Reasoning from this, their speed surpasses that of a galloping deer, and even the swiftest horse—said to cover a thousand li—cannot match it. Thus, I conclude they travel roughly a thousand li or so.\" That land yields cinnabar, azurite, sulfur, and purple and white quartz.\n\nDuboge and Poluo are kingdom names. They lie on an island in the Eastern Swelling Sea, due east of Funan. Sailing directly across the sea from Funan takes several dozen days to reach them. Their lands are populous, with cultivated rice fields. Women weave white *diedie* floral cloth, and both men and women wear white clothing. The land is rich in gold, tin, iron, and cinnabar, as common as dust. They use gold as currency and produce multicolored parrots, pigs, deer, domesticated water buffalo, large sheep, chickens, and ducks. They have no rhinoceroses, elephants, tigers, or leopards. The people are gentle and prudent, with customs resembling those of Guangzhou.\n\nWulun lies over two thousand li west of Funan. It is a large kingdom where coconut palms and various fruit trees grow on both sides of the roads. Their shade provides cool relief from the heat. Pavilions stand every ten li or so, each with a well. The people eat water caltrop rice and drink grape wine. The fruit is as viscous as glue, and when mixed with water, the wine becomes sweet and delicious. The people of this land often enjoy long lives, some reaching two hundred years.\n\nGouzhi lies eight hundred li from Dianxun. A river there flows southwest, then turns northeast before emptying into the sea. Far offshore, a great promontory juts into the sea, where the waters are shallow and rich in lodestone. Foreign merchants’ ships are clad in iron plates, but upon reaching this promontory, they are trapped by the lodestone and cannot pass. They must stop at Gouzhi to trade before returning.\n\nGeying lies south of Gouzhi, a journey of about a month. Along the way, a great mountain forest stretches to the sea’s edge, called Puluo. Within it dwell strange people with tails six *cun* long, who delight in devouring humans. In form, they stand between man and beast: if called human, they have tails and eat people; if called beast, they walk upright and wear headdresses. Their tails resemble those of beasts, but their gait is human. By their appearance, they exist between man and beast. Their hair is black as lacquer, their teeth white as silver, and their eyes red. Men and women go naked, without clothing, and fathers, sons, brothers, and sisters lie together openly. These are the barbarians of Geying; the kingdom has other, more refined people as well.\n\nLinyang lies over two thousand li west of Funan. Its men and women are fair-skinned and kind, and all revere the Dao. They use gold and silver as currency and produce plentiful cinnabar, sulfur, azurite, malachite, and purple quartz. They favor crimson silk and white pearls, which are the local attire.\n\nJiachen lies on the seashore southwest of Geying. The waters near its coast are shallow, and pirates from various kingdoms often lie in wait to rob travelers. Merchants must travel in groups to venture there.\n\nShihan lies southwest of Gouzhi. Sailing from Gouzhi takes fourteen or fifteen days to reach it. The kingdom has a king, and all revere the Great Dao. They are pure and observe proper rites, maintaining the dignity of the Han. Thus, it is called the Kingdom of Shihan. Immortals dwell there, and it produces luminous moon pearls. The people practice benevolence and kindness and abhor killing. The land is vast and fertile, with over ten thousand households. It abounds in gold, jade, and sulfur.\n\nHuli lies southwest of Gunu and Sidiao, seven or eight hundred li into a great bay. A great river originates in the northwest of Kunlun, flowing southeast into the sea. West of the river’s mouth, across over ten thousand li, lies Da Qin. Sailing in large ships carrying five or six hundred people, with seven sails catching the wind, takes a month to reach Da Qin.\n\nDadao lies in the middle of Sidiao, an island in the sea southeast of Geying, about three thousand li away. A king and his people reside there, devoted to the Great Dao. Their language and customs resemble those of the Central Kingdom. They govern with walled cities, markets, streets, and alleys. The land is fertile and beautiful, its people prosperous. It produces many rare treasures: gold, silver, white pearls, tortoiseshell, crystal, and *mahuo*.",

      "translated_text": "Moreover, there is a *fire pearl*, as large as a goose or duck’s egg, which appears like ice to the eye. When held in the hand, it is translucent, its light like moonlight illuminating the palm—visible even at night. If one points the fire pearl toward the sun in daylight and places mugwort tinder beneath it, after a moment, a beam of fire descends straight from the pearl, scattering like water dripping from a roof’s eaves. Suddenly, smoke rises and the tinder ignites, much like using a yang-sui to kindle fire. Those that emit water when facing shade are called *night-shining pearls*. Though they differ in producing water or fire, their essence is the same—only their names vary based on their refined properties.\n\nGazing southeast from the land of Sidiao at night, one often sees firelight illuminating the sky, as if from a great forge. Peering into the dark, the glow of that fire is said to mark the location of Yanzhou. There stands a *fire mountain*, where flames burn winter and summer alike.\n\nThe kingdom of Yinzhang lies some thirty or forty thousand *li* from Sidiao, rarely reached by travelers. Only once in several decades do people from Yanzhou sail to Sidiao. A hundred fire pearls are among the goods this land sells, which is how the people of Sidiao acquire them.\n\nThe land also has hills and paddy fields, fish and meat, fruits and grains, as well as beans, taro, and other crops. There grows a tree called *mahu*, resembling a pine. Boiling its bark and leaves yields a juice used to make cakes. When simmered and eaten, their taste is sweet and fragrant beyond compare, like malt sugar. They nourish the *qi* and are nearly a perfect food.\n\nDa Qin lies west of the ancient land of Gunu, some forty thousand *li* away, spanning thirty thousand *li* in territory—the greatest of kingdoms. Its people are tall and radiant, their angular caps filling the roads, their customs like those of Chang’an. This land is the source of the Great Dao, where discourse on the void and the subtle is unparalleled, far surpassing the empty words of those in the Central Kingdom.\n\nDaoists stand shoulder to shoulder, preserving the ways of high antiquity. They keep no slaves, and even the king and queen personally plow the fields and tend mulberry trees to weave silk, governing through the Dao. The people respond with righteousness, and no punishments, blades, or executions are used. The people are gentle and harmonious, many living long lives. The land is pure and temperate, neither cold nor hot. The gentry and common folk defer to one another, and the kingdom knows no wickedness—such is the transformative power of the Dao’s *qi*, the profound retreat of the noble. Here, the teachings of reward and retribution are made manifest, guiding all beings to embrace its transformation, beginning with Da Qin.\n\nThe people revere the Dao, extending its influence to the eight distant regions, much as the Old Master crossed the shifting sands to transform the Hu. Traveling from the sea into the great river for over seven thousand *li* brings one to this land. All the world’s treasures originate here, and in every household, coral serves as window lattices, tortoiseshell as walls, and crystal as steps and thresholds.\n\nOnce, people from the Central Kingdom journeyed to Funan, then boarded a ship from Funan, sailing into the sea intending to reach the land of Gunu. But the winds shifted, and they could not reach it, drifting elsewhere. Sailing day and night without rest, after sixty days they finally reached a shore—though they knew not where. Upon disembarking, they asked the locals and were told it was Da Qin. The merchants, having arrived at an unintended destination, were greatly alarmed, fearing capture and harm. They then pretended to be envoys of the king of Funan, sent to meet the king of Da Qin.\n\nThe king, seeing them, was astonished and said: “Your land lies at the farthest edge of the sea—how is it that people still come? From which kingdom do you hail, and why do you claim to be envoys of Funan?” They replied: “Your servants are envoys from the king of Funan at the northern sea’s edge, come to pay homage at your court, bowing in reverence. We have also heard of the rare treasures in your kingdom and wish to request some of your finest goods to bring glory to our humble land.”\n\nThe king of Da Qin said: “Are you people from the borderlands of Zhou? To brave the vast sea for twenty thousand *li* to reach my court—how arduous your journey must have been! When I first saw you arrive, I feared you had come to observe our ways, to assess the depth of our customs and the flow of our affairs. How could I have guessed you were driven by greed for rare goods, opening the door to strife and competition? Do you seek fine treasures only to strain your eyes and minds, fostering deceit and theft while increasing toil? Why would you risk your lives on the waves, so recklessly casting yourselves into the great sea?\n\nAs for the governance of Zhou—where men race after fleeting wealth and status—is this not contemptible? Is this not ruinous? From afar, I have witnessed its transformation: signs of chaos already appear across the six directions, and corrupt governance is evident even at the eight extremes. Nevertheless, since you have come to request gifts, I shall grant them for your return journey.”",

      "translated_text": "Then he bestowed upon the envoys purple-gold night-glowing pearls, five-colored dark pearls, coral spirit-jades, white harmony and uncarved essence, interlocking divine jade and luminous tiger gems, vajra and all manner of sacred treasures, sending them off at once. He admonished them, saying: “Our kingdom fundamentally esteems the Dao and virtue, holding such things in disdain; we honor benevolence and righteousness while despising greed and rapacity, cherish integrity and wisdom while rejecting dissipation and excess. We revere immortals to seek spiritual harmony, and respect purity and emptiness to preserve the four qi. We regard these motley, variegated objects as a flying swan regards insects and women.\n\nShould you return again with such goods, you will only incite competition within our pure land, harming the people’s eyes and minds. Deceit and strife will arise in our governance, and our refined customs will thereby decay. I shall instruct the gatekeepers to bar your entry.” His words served as a covenant of the heart, and the envoys departed in silence.\n\nFour years later, they arrived in Funan. The envoys first presented the king with a thousand bolts of colored silk from their ship’s cargo. The king laughed and said: “Barbarian silks—how coarse and flimsy! When goods are meager, the people suffer; this is no empty saying. Such things are of no use in our kingdom, so take them back.” He then displayed for the envoys the marvels of his jades and silks: eight-hued damasks, flowing azure brocades, fabrics woven with jade-threads, and sapphires embroidered with golden patterns. White as snow, red as dawn, blue surpassing kingfisher feathers, black like soaring crows—their radiance dazzled, their five colors richly arrayed, each bolt four feet wide and flawless. Seeing the envoys’ shabby attire, he scoffed: “The silks of the northern lands are truly laughable! Our Da Qin kingdom lacks nothing, and all is fine. The goods of the Central Kingdom can never compare.” As for their incense burners, they all used aloeswood and frankincense, their fragrance thick and lingering. The land knew no foul odors—truly a flourishing realm.\n\nUpon returning, the envoys recounted all this, and from then on, none dared journey again to Da Qin. Merchants spread the word, and trade ceased entirely. It is said that only those who personally practice benevolence and righteousness, uphold simplicity and detachment, delight in the emptiness of the Dao, and harbor no inner desires may journey to Da Qin and find fulfillment. Those who seek only exchange and profit act without reason.\n\nThe people of Da Qin are fair-skinned, tall, and often over ten feet in height. Their bearing is dignified, their conduct governed by ritual and measure. When still, they are serene; when speaking, their voices rise like clouds. Their interactions are noble and upright. Yet when they encounter merchants—men of no refined speech, ignorant of governance and advancement, driven only by greed—the king of Da Qin holds them in even greater contempt, declaring that all the people of Zhou are the same.\n\nLong ago, when the Laozi saw Zhou’s decline, he entered Da Qin to transform it, hence its name Funan. The envoys were men of Zhou. In Zhou’s time, the Four Seas submitted, and Funan paid tribute, as when the Yuechang people presented white pheasants and ivory to Zhou. Now, all the barbarians call the Central Kingdom “Han people” or “Jin people.” Da Qin lies so far from China that none travel between them. Since Laozi once served as a Zhou archivist before entering Da Qin, they must have called it the “Zhou kingdom,” unaware that Zhou had long since passed through a hundred dynasties.\n\nThe kingdom of Gunu Sidiao lies some ten thousand *li* from Geying. Its land and people number over ten thousand households, most fair-skinned and tall. The people all ride four-wheeled carriages drawn by two or four horses, gathering at crossroads. Their ships number over a hundred, and their markets host tens of thousands, trading day and night. As the ships sail, they sound drums, pipes, and horns. The people’s clothing resembles that of China, and their land yields gold and jade as common as tiles and stones. This kingdom also reveres the Great Dao.\n\nThe kingdom of Chalao lies between Anxi and Da Qin, a great land. Over five thousand *li* from Tianzhu, its people are brave and strong. The entire kingdom claims descent from kings, yet has no permanent ruler. Instead, they select elders of virtue and renown to serve as king, replacing them every three years. The whole land honors them. The land’s produce is the same as Tianzhu’s, with even more treasures too numerous to name. The people of Chalao cherish their homeland and never travel far, living in peace and contentment. The kingdom has no punishments or executions, only the cultivation of benevolence, righteousness, blessings, and virtue—a land of profound harmony.\n\nThe kingdom of Yebo lies three thousand *li* from Tianzhu. Its people and land are the same as Tianzhu’s.\n\nThe kingdom of Jibin lies northwest of Yuezhi, a great land. Its terrain is vast and flat, its people gentle. It has alfalfa, rare trees, sandalwood, catalpa, bamboo, lacquer, and saffron. They cultivate the five grains, grapes, and various fruits. Their fields are often low and damp, so they plant rice. The people are highly skilled, excelling in carving, engraving, and embroidery. They enjoy music, wine, and feasting. Their lands yield gibbons, peacocks, pearls, amber, tortoiseshell, crystal, and livestock like those of China. Alfalfa is a divine treasure.",

      "translated_text": "The plant resembles a taro. When a person’s eyes become blind and the sockets are entirely hollowed out, one may extract the juice from its roots and consume it, or boil its stems and leaves into a decoction to apply to the hollow, rotted sockets. After seven or eight days, the pupils and irises will regenerate, and the eyes will be fully restored.\n\nAn ancient legend tells of a man afflicted with blindness who was suddenly summoned by the king of his time. Facing the royal command, he had no time to prepare medicine. A divine physician instructed him to borrow one of his wife’s eyes for use, and he followed the physician’s words. The physician took a blade and carved out the wife’s eye, lending it to the man for a single night before returning it. When the physician first removed the eye, he had the man drink the juice of the herb’s roots and soak the eye in it, so that when he carved it, the wife felt no pain. Placing the eye into the man’s socket, he blended it with the same juice, and it immediately became one with his body, allowing him to see all things clearly. When the eye was returned, the physician again used the juice, and it reverted to its original state.\n\nThis herb is a divine plant bestowed by heaven, its wonders beyond description. Thus, it is called *muxu* grass, for it was borrowed for a night. In my youth, I heard this tale but dismissed it as false. Later, in the southern frontier, I inquired among scholars, and those with knowledge said: *Muxu* grass grows on a separate mountain in the kingdom of Jibin, appearing only once every hundred years. Its form resembles the Chinese sweet flag, and it is exceedingly rare—only the most devoted may behold it. This mountain is now called Muxu Mountain. Its many springs are blue-green, and when the people of Jibin, young or old, suffer from eye ailments, they are carried in litters to bathe in these springs, and none fail to recover. If the water alone can cure eye diseases, how much more effective must the divine herb, which grows but once in a century, be in healing hollowed, rotted sockets?\n\nAs the ancient legends foretell, upon examining the mountains and rivers, one finds that such wonders must exist. There was a foreigner named Shi Yanzhang who had long resided in Funan and frequently traveled abroad. He claimed to have visited Jibin and seen Muxu Mountain, though it was not particularly tall. The mountain bore no other plants but was filled with rare trees resembling *tuo*. When these trees were felled and used to craft tables, chairs, cart seats, or buildings, or even broken into smaller pieces, they were buried in the earth and would regrow like planted willows. These were called \"miscellaneous rare trees.\" If buried beneath Muxu Mountain, they would thrive, but in other lands, they would not grow.\n\n*(Hong’s note: This mountain must be a hill of immortality. How can one say this? Its herb, when used, restores sight to rotted eyes and grants clarity; its trees, though felled, may be replanted after a hundred years. The mountain’s stones possess a divine power to restore human essence, and its flowing springs nurture even decayed wood back to life. Truly, one could dwell here to nourish the body, follow the mountain’s *qi*, and enjoy eternal tranquility—yet the people of that land have long failed to realize this.)*\n\nYuezhi lies seven thousand *li* north of Tianzhu. Its horses and treasures are like those of Tianzhu. The land is high and cold, and all ride four-wheeled carts, some drawn by four, five, or even six or seven yokes. No cart is small, and the largest can hold twenty people. The king is called the Son of Heaven, and the capital’s populace numbers in the hundreds of thousands. Its cities, palaces, and halls resemble those of Da Qin. The people are Hu in appearance but exceptionally fair, and their clothing and rituals reflect filial piety—fathers are kind, children obedient. Their laws are strict, and they do not squat when seated, surpassing even Tianzhu in these virtues. Some there follow the Great Dao.\n\nThe land spans two thousand *li* in each direction. It is cold and abundant in frost and snow. Ginger does not grow there, and they rely on Tianzhu for it. They have no silkworms and weave wool into fine fabrics. Some dogs and sheep have wool two or three *chi* long, which men and women alike use continuously.\n\nAnxi lies eight thousand *li* west of Yuezhi. Its land and customs are entirely like those of Yuezhi. Its people and horses are fierce and brave. The land spans five thousand *li*, and gold and jade are as common as stone, used as currency. When a king dies, new coins are cast. The land has dogs, horses, and great birds. To its left lies a territory ruled by over a hundred kings, who dwell separately and do not submit to Yuezhi.\n\nYouqian lies seven thousand *li* southeast of Tianzhu. Its land, people, and customs are all like those of Tianzhu. The rare and precious objects it produces surpass even those of Yuezhi. From this, one knows the vastness of heaven and earth, beyond the reach of imagination. Though these kingdoms are distant, they will be recorded later—yet none know their boundaries.\n\nDa Qin and Yuezhi are said to border Kunlun, lying southwest of the Rinan Sea route. They are the greatest lands of which we have heard.\n\nThe various fragrant substances each have their origins. *Chen* and *fu* woods come from Rinan. *Duliang* and *qingling* come from Dianxun. *Jishe* and *fenluo* grow in Dubo. *Youjian* and *rulai* come from Wulun. *Qingmu* is from Tianzhu, *yujin* from Jibin, *suhe* from Anxi, and *xunlu* from Da Qin—all are treasures of their respective plants, whether flowers, resins, hearts, or branches.\n\nOnly *jiaxiang*, conch shells, and the like are born in the depths of Geying, Juzhi, and other such seas. *Weiluo* comes from Yuezhi, sulfur from Dukun, *baifu* from Shihan, *guangbi* from Jiachen, *lan* and *ai* from these lands, and *youmu* from Youqian. None of their wondrous aromas compare to *zhen tan*.\n\n*The Lower Scroll of the Scripture of Divine Elixir of Golden Liquor from the Great Clarity is hereby concluded.*",
