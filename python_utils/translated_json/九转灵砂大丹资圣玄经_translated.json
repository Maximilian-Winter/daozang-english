Source text from the *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, Dongshen Section, Zhongshu Category.*\n\n---\n\nAt that time, the Perfected One of the Great Ultimate dwelt in the Osmanthus Grove of Mount Fuluo in the Yuya Great River of the Western Na Jade Kingdom. With three thousand times ten thousand in assembly, they sat upon a seven-jeweled jade terrace, burning the hundred-harmonies wondrous incense. Then, the lofty immortals and wondrous perfected ones, along with deviant demons and heterodox paths—thirty-six thousand in all—gathered together.\n\nAt that moment, the Perfected One Baoji reflected: \"From of old, I have cultivated and refined the arts of transcendence, and now I have attained the Dao. Yet I still pity the sentient beings who temper and refine, the later learners and aspirants of the true way—those who fly elixirs and turn stones, who ingest gold and silver, whose snow-white frost-flowers, four medicines and eight luminaries, nine-cycled elixirs, transformative supreme treasures, and corpse-liberation medicines all remain unaccomplished.\" Thus reflecting, the Perfected One Baoji rose from his seat, adjusted his robes and cap, and with composed and graceful steps, approached the jeweled throne. Bowing his head in reverence, he addressed the Perfected One of the Great Ultimate:\n\n\"By what cultivation may I join this assembly? From of old, I have practiced the refinement of the great elixir, and now I have attained the Dao. Yet I pity all sentient beings and later learners who, encountering the final kalpa of the lower epoch, burn elixirs and refine treasures, transforming the five metals, yet never achieve success. I only beseech the Perfected One, in your great compassion and mercy, to broadly open the Dharma seal. By what causes and conditions may one accomplish transformation and achieve the great medicine of the golden elixir? How is it cyclically refined?\"\n\nThe Perfected One replied: \"Excellent, excellent! The causes and conditions you inquire about—listen closely. Now I shall briefly reveal the essence of body and mind, illuminate the essentials of the Dao, and expound this *Zisheng Mysterious Scripture*. Its profound and wondrous principles enable all to attain the Dao.\n\nThe method of elixir refinement requires a tripod with three legs, corresponding to the Three Powers. The upper and lower halves join, symbolizing the Two Modes. The legs stand four inches high, aligning with the four seasons. The furnace is eight inches deep, matching the eight solar terms. Below, eight gates open to channel the eight winds. Twenty-four catties of charcoal generate the twenty-four qi. Yin and yang invert, water and fire contend. The upper water draws the celestial pure qi; the lower fire takes the earthly turbid qi. Heaven’s qi descends, earth’s qi ascends—they meet, intermingle, and coalesce in harmonious fusion, uniting as the two qi. Once conjoined, they merge into one, called the Great Elixir of the Two Qi. Its wondrous efficacy lies entirely herein. Within the twelve hours, one seizes a thousand years of transformation—this is the Way of the Initial Elixir.\"\n\n---\n\n**Chapter One: The True Father and Mother of the Divine Cinnabar Great Elixir**\n\nFor the transformation of divine cinnabar, one must select a single mother of numinous medicine. To establish the furnace and tripod, first dwell in the mountains and forests, choosing a tranquil place in the auspicious direction of flourishing vitality to position the furnace. On one of the Four Inauspicious Days, take four taels of white yang essence from the upper realm and sixteen taels of solar palace fluid. Mix and stir-fry them into azure gold—this is the green-black of the eastern Jia-Yi Wood. Grind it in a mortar with a willow pestle into powder, place it in the tripod, with water above and fire below. The fire regimen follows in later chapters.\n\nBegin the fire at the hour of *yin*, and after one *fu* period, one may seize a thousand years of transformation. When removed from the furnace, its red hue pertains to the southern Bing-Ding Fire—this is the red-black. Break it into pieces like lotus seeds, place them in a loose cloth bag, and suspend it within the womb of the empty-boiling tripod. Use an infusion of mulberry ash, three taels each of borax, saltpeter, green vitriol, and alum. Boil for one *fu* period, then remove, bathe clean, and dry in the sun. Next, boil with petroleum for two hours, remove, bathe clean, and dry. Coat each piece with white honey, roll them in dry borax, and adhere to the body. Then apply bismuth frost to the body, followed by bismuth yellow flowers—this yields the yellow hue, belonging to the central Wu-Ji Earth, the yellow qi.\n\nTake one catty of the father-mother powder, mix with equal parts of mume fruit, fringed pink, ephedra, and polygala, ground into powder. Stir-fry until yellow, then blend evenly with fine bitter wine. Shape into lotus-seed forms, nurture one catty of mother-father powder, and pair with four taels of divine cinnabar. Seal properly and dry. Place in the furnace, cover the crucible with ten-thousand-coin ash to a depth of two inches, and nurture with fire for seven days—this suffices. The fire regimen follows in later chapters.\n\nWhen the furnace cools, the fire-resistant black hue pertains to the northern Ren-Gui Water—this is the black qi. Melt the divine cinnabar in a large cauldron into liquid. Use equal parts of anemarrhena, croton, castor bean, saltpeter, and sea salt, ground into powder and wrapped in paper. Cast into the liquid seven times. Then, without cease, toss in saltpeter until the liquid clarifies, its color resplendently white—this pertains to the white qi of the western Geng-Xin Metal. This is the great gathering of the elixir, the chief of the Five Phases. Thus begins the first cycle, dependent on the mother mercury—silver.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Two: The Holy Embryo’s Birth of the Divine Cinnabar Great Elixir**\n\nTake one catty of the previously nurtured mother mercury-silver, swiftly grind it into powder with a hard pestle, and use a strong lodestone to remove iron filings. Select four taels of mirror-bright cinnabar. Prepare a silver crucible: first spread two taels of mother mercury-silver powder inside, layer one tier of cinnabar, then another tier of mercury-silver powder, and another tier of cinnabar. Complete the layers, then cover with four taels of mother mercury-silver powder. Seal the seams with red halloysite, then paste a strip of Kunlun paper two fingers wide over the mouth’s seam. Apply a layer of alum clay one finger thick, and let dry.\n\nPlace the crucible in an ash pit, resting it upon an iron tripod. Cover the crucible with \"ten-thousand-coin ash,\" leaving the ash approximately two fingers high above it. Nurture with fire until the ash glows red. Use a fragrant spoon to mound the ash around the base of the crucible, leaving a small opening at the center to allow the fire to pass through and blacken. Cover the top with an object, also leaving an opening. Proceed with the fire regimen as for nurturing a lotus seed. After fourteen days of gentle fire, carefully remove the crucible, split it open with a knife, and the cinnabar within will have transformed entirely into the supreme treasure. Resistant to fire and unbroken, discard the mother mercury-silver powder and place only the cinnabar into an iron crucible. Pour two taels of mercury inside, seal the seams as before, and return it to the ash pit. Nurture with fire for seven full days, then let it cool overnight. The mercury will dry on its own.\n\nRepeat this process, adding mercury every seven days until the crucible is full, but do not exceed five taels of fire. Once full, break open the crucible, remove the contents, and slice off the dried mercury from the top—amounting to thirty or fifty taels—grind it into powder, or crush it and place it back into the crucible. Seal the seams as before, let dry, and nurture with fire in the ash pit for another seven days. After cooling, first melt one tael of true father-mother into liquid, then gradually add the dried mercury, blending it into a clear liquid. Pour this into a mold; this is called true mercury-silver. To subdue mercury, one must first subdue mercury. Silver.\n\nAlternatively, take twenty taels of the initially harvested dried mercury-cinnabar, reserving one catty to mix with two taels of powdered frost and gold-foot arsenic cinnabar, grinding them finely together. Place them in a crucible, cover with two taels of remaining mercury-cinnabar, seal the seams as before, and let dry. Nurture with fire for fourteen days, then remove from the furnace. First melt eight taels of red silver into liquid, add half a tael of saltpeter, skim off the dross, and remelt. Add the previously nurtured three taels of powdered frost in four portions, stirring with a charcoal rod until even. Pour into a mold to form the superior \"Bone-Transforming Yang Elixir.\" For every eight taels of red silver, add one tael and two mace of father-mother—this is the fixed method. Other methods of refinement naturally restore their nature, but this method is most wondrous, never reverting. The true mercury-silver harmonizes with the elixir. The success of this process defies full description.\n\n**Chapter Three: The Jade Pool’s Luminous Lotus of Divine Cinnabar**\n\nTake the previously harvested cinnabar and dried mercury, totaling ten taels, place them in a crucible, and after seven days, add three taels of mercury. Repeat the process until the crucible is full, remove the dried mercury, and nurture it empty for another seven days. Refine it in the mother furnace to produce the supreme treasure. Remove the top layer of cinnabar and dried mercury, totaling ten taels, and add mercury—this mercury becomes the \"Longevity Repository.\" This concludes the third cycle, marking the beginning of the \"Longevity-Increasing Cycle.\"\n\nTo increase the cycle, take four taels of radiant, mirror-like cinnabar and one catty of true gold, grind them into powder, and layer the cinnabar as before. Cover with the true gold powder, then top with four taels of \"Jade Pool Luminous Lotus\" cinnabar powder, separated by Kunlun paper. Seal the seams as before and place it in the ash pit. Nurture with fire for twenty-one days—the fire regimen is detailed in the following chapter. After cooling overnight, remove the cinnabar lumps, which will have all turned to gold. Place the purified gold cinnabar into a clean crucible, and as before, add two taels of mercury every seven days until the crucible is full. Remove the dried mercury from the top, use the medicine to nurture separately in the mother furnace, and refine the luminous lotus cinnabar into the treasure called \"Bone-Transforming Yang Cinnabar,\" whose efficacy is profound. This method is named the \"Golden Valley Seed.\"\n\n**Chapter Four: The Immortal’s Palm Moonlit Pool of Divine Cinnabar**\n\nPlace the Golden Valley Seed cinnabar into a crucible, add three taels of mercury, seal the seams as before, and place it in the ash pit. Nurture with fire for seven days. Add mercury until the crucible is full, then remove the pale yellow dried mercury from the top. The cinnabar and dried mercury beneath, totaling ten taels, serve as the mother for adding mercury—this mercury becomes the \"Longevity Gold Repository.\" Grind the pale gold mercury into powder, place it in a clean crucible, and layer it with equal parts of chalcanthite, halite, and ochre powder on the bottom and top. Seal the seams as before, nurture with fire for twenty-one days, and it will turn a deep red, becoming refined purple gold.\n\nIf the Golden Valley Seed cinnabar is ground into powder and mercury is added, it can be sown in the morning and harvested by evening, transforming into metal. Through further refinement, it becomes the \"Purple Palace Golden Lotus,\" whose efficacy is exceptional. It can generate both gold and silver smiles, and only then is it suitable for transmutation.\n\n**Chapter Five: The Purple Palace Golden Lotus of Divine Cinnabar**\n\nTake ten taels of Golden Valley Seed and place them in a crucible. To produce a gold smile, boil mercury with chalcanthite and add it—this yields gold-grade elixir. To produce a jade smile, boil mercury with alum and add it—this yields jade-grade elixir. Without boiling the mercury, adding it for seven days produces pale gold, though its qi is insufficient. Once the crucible is full, remove it, layer the top with dried mercury-gold powder as before, nurture it in the mother furnace, and melt it into high-grade yellow gold, becoming a treasure beyond this world.\n\nTake ten taels of Purple Palace Golden Lotus cinnabar as the mother, and as its generative qi becomes abundant, the added mercury will surge like a fountain.\n\n**Chapter Six: The Purple Palace Fountain of Divine Cinnabar**\n\nPlace ten taels of Purple Palace Golden Lotus cinnabar into a crucible, add three taels of mercury, and nurture it from dawn to dusk. Add mercury until the crucible is full, then remove the dried mercury-gold without further nurturing—it can then be refined and used to transform the five metals, all returning to their true nature.\n\n**Chapter Seven: The Sevenfold Return of Golden Liquor and the Reverted Elixir**\n\nTake ten taels of cinnabar-mercury from the lower crucible, augment it through seven returns, and it becomes the Sevenfold Return Golden Liquor—penetrating the profound and subtle mysteries of the Dao. Without innate immortal bones or the transmutative touch of a perfected being, one cannot attain this.\n\n**Chapter Eight: The Return-to-Origin Numinous Liquor Golden Elixir**\n\nGrind the reverted Golden Liquor Elixir into powder, place it in a clean crucible, seal it properly, and nurture it with fire for eight eights of days. Once the furnace cools, retrieve it and bury it seven feet underground to dispel the fire-toxin. After seven days, grind it finely into powder, mix with jujube pulp, and form into pellets the size of mung beans. If a person has died but not yet passed three days, pry open their mouth and administer one pellet—they will revive. Consuming it grants immortality. When used to transmute the five metals, all become supreme treasures.\n\n**Chapter Nine: The Ninefold Cyclic Golden Elixir**\n\nGrind the Numinous Liquor Reverted Elixir into powder, place it in a clean crucible, seal it properly, and nurture it with fire for nine nines of days. Once the furnace cools, retrieve it and bury it one *zhang* underground to dispel the fire-toxin. After fourteen days, grind it finely into powder, mix with jujube pulp, and form into pellets the size of mung beans. Consuming one pellet extends lifespan; two pellets grant longevity and enduring vision; three to five pellets transform the bones and lighten the body. Taking a hundred pellets allows one to ascend in broad daylight, attaining pure yang and transcending the mortal realm. If ten *jin* of black bismuth are melted in a cauldron over fierce fire until boiling thrice, and one *zhū* of the Ninefold Cyclic Essence is added, it instantly transforms into nine *jin* of white silver. If ten *jin* of mercury are heated in an iron cauldron, and ten taels of chalcanthite are added, boiling it several times before introducing five *zhū* of the Ninefold Cyclic Essence, it instantly becomes nine *jin* of refined yellow gold. Such is the verification of the Ninefold Cyclic Cinnabar. Consuming it allows one to ascend in broad daylight, ascend to the Golden Gates, and attend the Celestial Thearch. I now reveal this to you—guard it closely. To transmit it recklessly brings calamity upon nine generations.\n\nThe Most High Lord Lao once said: \"To withhold it from the worthy is called concealing a celestial treasure; to transmit it to the unworthy is called leaking celestial mechanisms. To violate either is to commit an unforgivable sin.\"\n\nAt that time, the Perfected One Baoji, having heard this, rejoiced exuberantly, bowed to the Perfected One, and with the assembly of all immortals, performed three prostrations in reverence. Praising and extolling, he recited:\n\nThe great medicine has no head,\nThe golden elixir cauldron has no ears.\nCreation requires no herbs,\nThe sacred embryo must be refined.\nOnly when true father and mother unite\nDo they align with the principles of heaven and earth.\nLater learners should ponder deeply,\nExamining each meaning with care.\nGold transforms into gold—\nA secret formula of the loftiest immortals.\nSilver transforms into silver—\nA revelation of the divine transcendents.\nWhen the work of creation is complete,\nGuard it closely and do not leak it.\n\nAfter the Perfected One Baoji offered this hymn, the assembled immortals rose from their seats, circumambulated him seven times to the left, and declared: \"We and all others here vow to receive and uphold this teaching, to deliver and liberate sentient beings.\" Bowing to the Perfected One, they paid their respects and withdrew, pledging to follow the instructions.\n\n**The Fire Regimen for Dual-Refinement Cinnabar: The Martial Fire Phase**\n\nWhen refining dual-refinement cinnabar, begin at the *yin* hour by applying four taels of fire, six taels at the *mao* hour, and half a *jin* at the *chen* hour. Continue increasing gradually to one *jin*, two *jin*, and three *jin*. Use a total of twenty-four *jin* of peeled, clean charcoal, then cease adding fire and replenish with water. By the *shen* and *you* hours, the cinnabar will naturally congeal. Nurture the fire for three more hours, then extinguish the charcoal and stop the water, allowing the fire to dissipate on its own. Lift the crucible from the furnace, and once cooled, select the hardened portions as the finest. If the furnace is too slow, refine it again with blue-green gold.\n\nThis is the martial fire regimen for crafting dual-refinement black cinnabar.\n\nThere is another method: When refining cinnabar, choose a day of the Four Executioners for great auspiciousness.\n\n**The Fire Regimen for Nurturing Cinnabar: The Civil Fire Phase**\n\nWhen nurturing numinous cinnabar with fire:\n- On the first day, apply two taels of top fire.\n- On the second day, apply three taels of top fire.\n- On the third day, apply four taels of top fire.\n- On the fourth day, apply five taels of top fire and four taels of side fire, totaling seven taels.\n- On the fifth day, apply four taels of top fire and one tael of side fire on each side, totaling half a *jin* of fire. Do not exceed this, lest the mother be harmed.\n- On the sixth and seventh days, apply fire at the *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you* hours, using half a *jin* each time, replenishing the new and removing the old.\n\nThis is the true civil fire regimen for nurturing the father and mother of cinnabar.\n\nWhen nurturing numinous cinnabar with fire:\n- On the first day, apply one tael of top fire.\n- On the second day, also apply one tael.\n- On the third day, add one and a half taels of side fire, totaling two and a half taels. Divide one and a half taels of mature fire into four strips, placing them about three finger-widths from the crucible on all four sides, separated by loose straw ash. Do not completely cover the fire with ash, lest it die. If the fire dies, promptly remove it with tongs and replace it according to the original weight.\n- On the fourth day, add three taels of side fire, dividing it into eight strips and placing them three finger-widths from the crucible, again separated by loose straw ash. On top of the crucible, pile ash three finger-widths high, place eight *qian* of mature fire beneath, and cover it with one *cun* of ash, leaving a small fire hole in the center to prevent extinction. Do not let the fire burn too fiercely, lest the mother be harmed.\n- On the fifth day, apply five taels of side fire, dividing the charcoal into twelve strips and arranging them evenly around the crucible, about two and a half finger-widths away. Separate them with loose straw ash as before. Apply one tael of top fire, totaling six taels. If the ash in the furnace has no fire and the top of the crucible has no charcoal, quickly use an iron spoon to stir the ash. Test it with your hand—if the ash feels like warm mud, wait briefly before adding fire according to the previous measurements.\n\nBy the sixth and seventh days, apply a total of half a *jin* of fire, adding new fire and removing old fire in accordance with the four cardinal hours of *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you*. After these seven days, the true father and mother have arrived—this is the time for gentle fire.\n\n**Method for Yin-Refining Cinnabar to Restrain Sulfur**\n- Sulfur: half a *jin*\n- *Zuowei*: half a *jin*\n- Mulberry ash juice: one *sheng*\n\nGrind the sulfur finely, place it in a bamboo tube, and boil it with vinegar and ash juice for three *shi* (six hours).\n\n**Method for Yin-Refining Mercury**\n- Mercury: one *jin*\n- Vinegar: one *sheng*\n- Mulberry ash juice: two *sheng*\n- Borax and *pao* (processed minerals): two *liang* each\n- White alum, green alum, yellow alum, chicken-dung alum, willow-catkin alum: two *qian* each\n- *Xin* (arsenic): one *qian*\n\nGrind the above ingredients finely, place them in a clay pot, and boil with vinegar and ash juice for five *shi* (ten hours). Then, drain the sulfur and mercury separately until dry before proceeding to stir-fry *qingjin* (green-gold). Meanwhile, simmer the medicinal juice into a paste.\n\n**Method for Stir-Frying Qingjin**\nFirst, grind the sulfur finely and melt it in an iron pan. Then, add mercury and stir together with an iron spoon. If ghostly flames appear, sprinkle the previously simmered vinegar paste and stir gently until slightly congealed. Spread it on five layers of fine paper, cover with raw silk, and bury it in damp earth for two to three *shi* (four to six hours) until it cools and hardens like iron. Then, crush it, place it in a crucible, and apply water above and fire below, gradually increasing the intensity over eight *shi* (sixteen hours) to refine the *erqi* (dual-qi) cinnabar. Use twenty-four *jin* of charcoal.\n\n**Method for Yin-Refining Erqi Cinnabar**\n- Yellow alum: two *qian*\n- White alum: two *qian*\n- Green salt: two *qian*\n- Sichuan pepper: two *qian*\n- *Diyu* (burnet): two *qian*\n- *Xixin* (asarum): two *qian*\n- Croton: two *qian*\n- *Paosha* (processed cinnabar): two *qian*\n- *Mingxin* (refined arsenic): one *qian*\n- *Wutou* (aconite): two *qian*\n- *Changpu* (calamus): two *qian*\n- Borax: two *qian*\n- Mulberry ash juice: three *sheng*\n- Vinegar: one *sheng*\n\nGrind the above ingredients finely and place them in a clay pot. Enclose the *erqi* lotus-seed cinnabar in a silk bag and suspend it in the pot to boil for one *fu* (ten days) as the standard duration. Afterward, store it in a sealed container for nourishment.\n\n*The Nine Cycles of Divine Cinnabar: The Great Elixir and Mysterious Classic of the Sage’s Resources* concludes.",

Source text from the *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, Dongshen Section, Zhongshu Category.*\n\n---\n\nAt that time, the Perfected One of the Great Ultimate dwelt in the Osmanthus Grove of Mount Fuluo in the Yuya Great River of the Western Na Jade Kingdom. With three thousand times ten thousand in assembly, they sat upon a seven-jeweled jade terrace, burning the hundred-harmonies wondrous incense. Then, the lofty immortals and wondrous perfected ones, along with deviant demons and heterodox paths—thirty-six thousand in all—gathered together.\n\nAt that moment, the Perfected One Baoji reflected: \"From of old, I have cultivated and refined the arts of transcendence, and now I have attained the Dao. Yet I still pity the sentient beings who temper and refine, the later learners and aspirants of the true way—those who fly elixirs and turn stones, who ingest gold and silver, whose snow-white frost-flowers, four medicines and eight luminaries, nine-cycled elixirs, transformative supreme treasures, and corpse-liberation medicines all remain unaccomplished.\" Thus reflecting, the Perfected One Baoji rose from his seat, adjusted his robes and cap, and with composed and graceful steps, approached the jeweled throne. Bowing his head in reverence, he addressed the Perfected One of the Great Ultimate:\n\n\"By what cultivation may I join this assembly? From of old, I have practiced the refinement of the great elixir, and now I have attained the Dao. Yet I pity all sentient beings and later learners who, encountering the final kalpa of the lower epoch, burn elixirs and refine treasures, transforming the five metals, yet never achieve success. I only beseech the Perfected One, in your great compassion and mercy, to broadly open the Dharma seal. By what causes and conditions may one accomplish transformation and achieve the great medicine of the golden elixir? How is it cyclically refined?\"\n\nThe Perfected One replied: \"Excellent, excellent! The causes and conditions you inquire about—listen closely. Now I shall briefly reveal the essence of body and mind, illuminate the essentials of the Dao, and expound this *Zisheng Mysterious Scripture*. Its profound and wondrous principles enable all to attain the Dao.\n\nThe method of elixir refinement requires a tripod with three legs, corresponding to the Three Powers. The upper and lower halves join, symbolizing the Two Modes. The legs stand four inches high, aligning with the four seasons. The furnace is eight inches deep, matching the eight solar terms. Below, eight gates open to channel the eight winds. Twenty-four catties of charcoal generate the twenty-four qi. Yin and yang invert, water and fire contend. The upper water draws the celestial pure qi; the lower fire takes the earthly turbid qi. Heaven’s qi descends, earth’s qi ascends—they meet, intermingle, and coalesce in harmonious fusion, uniting as the two qi. Once conjoined, they merge into one, called the Great Elixir of the Two Qi. Its wondrous efficacy lies entirely herein. Within the twelve hours, one seizes a thousand years of transformation—this is the Way of the Initial Elixir.\"\n\n---\n\n**Chapter One: The True Father and Mother of the Divine Cinnabar Great Elixir**\n\nFor the transformation of divine cinnabar, one must select a single mother of numinous medicine. To establish the furnace and tripod, first dwell in the mountains and forests, choosing a tranquil place in the auspicious direction of flourishing vitality to position the furnace. On one of the Four Inauspicious Days, take four taels of white yang essence from the upper realm and sixteen taels of solar palace fluid. Mix and stir-fry them into azure gold—this is the green-black of the eastern Jia-Yi Wood. Grind it in a mortar with a willow pestle into powder, place it in the tripod, with water above and fire below. The fire regimen follows in later chapters.\n\nBegin the fire at the hour of *yin*, and after one *fu* period, one may seize a thousand years of transformation. When removed from the furnace, its red hue pertains to the southern Bing-Ding Fire—this is the red-black. Break it into pieces like lotus seeds, place them in a loose cloth bag, and suspend it within the womb of the empty-boiling tripod. Use an infusion of mulberry ash, three taels each of borax, saltpeter, green vitriol, and alum. Boil for one *fu* period, then remove, bathe clean, and dry in the sun. Next, boil with petroleum for two hours, remove, bathe clean, and dry. Coat each piece with white honey, roll them in dry borax, and adhere to the body. Then apply bismuth frost to the body, followed by bismuth yellow flowers—this yields the yellow hue, belonging to the central Wu-Ji Earth, the yellow qi.\n\nTake one catty of the father-mother powder, mix with equal parts of mume fruit, fringed pink, ephedra, and polygala, ground into powder. Stir-fry until yellow, then blend evenly with fine bitter wine. Shape into lotus-seed forms, nurture one catty of mother-father powder, and pair with four taels of divine cinnabar. Seal properly and dry. Place in the furnace, cover the crucible with ten-thousand-coin ash to a depth of two inches, and nurture with fire for seven days—this suffices. The fire regimen follows in later chapters.\n\nWhen the furnace cools, the fire-resistant black hue pertains to the northern Ren-Gui Water—this is the black qi. Melt the divine cinnabar in a large cauldron into liquid. Use equal parts of anemarrhena, croton, castor bean, saltpeter, and sea salt, ground into powder and wrapped in paper. Cast into the liquid seven times. Then, without cease, toss in saltpeter until the liquid clarifies, its color resplendently white—this pertains to the white qi of the western Geng-Xin Metal. This is the great gathering of the elixir, the chief of the Five Phases. Thus begins the first cycle, dependent on the mother mercury—silver.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Two: The Holy Embryo’s Birth of the Divine Cinnabar Great Elixir**\n\nTake one catty of the previously nurtured mother mercury-silver, swiftly grind it into powder with a hard pestle, and use a strong lodestone to remove iron filings. Select four taels of mirror-bright cinnabar. Prepare a silver crucible: first spread two taels of mother mercury-silver powder inside, layer one tier of cinnabar, then another tier of mercury-silver powder, and another tier of cinnabar. Complete the layers, then cover with four taels of mother mercury-silver powder. Seal the seams with red halloysite, then paste a strip of Kunlun paper two fingers wide over the mouth’s seam. Apply a layer of alum clay one finger thick, and let dry.",

      "translated_text": "Place the crucible in an ash pit, resting it upon an iron tripod. Cover the crucible with \"ten-thousand-coin ash,\" leaving the ash approximately two fingers high above it. Nurture with fire until the ash glows red. Use a fragrant spoon to mound the ash around the base of the crucible, leaving a small opening at the center to allow the fire to pass through and blacken. Cover the top with an object, also leaving an opening. Proceed with the fire regimen as for nurturing a lotus seed. After fourteen days of gentle fire, carefully remove the crucible, split it open with a knife, and the cinnabar within will have transformed entirely into the supreme treasure. Resistant to fire and unbroken, discard the mother mercury-silver powder and place only the cinnabar into an iron crucible. Pour two taels of mercury inside, seal the seams as before, and return it to the ash pit. Nurture with fire for seven full days, then let it cool overnight. The mercury will dry on its own.\n\nRepeat this process, adding mercury every seven days until the crucible is full, but do not exceed five taels of fire. Once full, break open the crucible, remove the contents, and slice off the dried mercury from the top—amounting to thirty or fifty taels—grind it into powder, or crush it and place it back into the crucible. Seal the seams as before, let dry, and nurture with fire in the ash pit for another seven days. After cooling, first melt one tael of true father-mother into liquid, then gradually add the dried mercury, blending it into a clear liquid. Pour this into a mold; this is called true mercury-silver. To subdue mercury, one must first subdue mercury. Silver.\n\nAlternatively, take twenty taels of the initially harvested dried mercury-cinnabar, reserving one catty to mix with two taels of powdered frost and gold-foot arsenic cinnabar, grinding them finely together. Place them in a crucible, cover with two taels of remaining mercury-cinnabar, seal the seams as before, and let dry. Nurture with fire for fourteen days, then remove from the furnace. First melt eight taels of red silver into liquid, add half a tael of saltpeter, skim off the dross, and remelt. Add the previously nurtured three taels of powdered frost in four portions, stirring with a charcoal rod until even. Pour into a mold to form the superior \"Bone-Transforming Yang Elixir.\" For every eight taels of red silver, add one tael and two mace of father-mother—this is the fixed method. Other methods of refinement naturally restore their nature, but this method is most wondrous, never reverting. The true mercury-silver harmonizes with the elixir. The success of this process defies full description.\n\n**Chapter Three: The Jade Pool’s Luminous Lotus of Divine Cinnabar**\n\nTake the previously harvested cinnabar and dried mercury, totaling ten taels, place them in a crucible, and after seven days, add three taels of mercury. Repeat the process until the crucible is full, remove the dried mercury, and nurture it empty for another seven days. Refine it in the mother furnace to produce the supreme treasure. Remove the top layer of cinnabar and dried mercury, totaling ten taels, and add mercury—this mercury becomes the \"Longevity Repository.\" This concludes the third cycle, marking the beginning of the \"Longevity-Increasing Cycle.\"\n\nTo increase the cycle, take four taels of radiant, mirror-like cinnabar and one catty of true gold, grind them into powder, and layer the cinnabar as before. Cover with the true gold powder, then top with four taels of \"Jade Pool Luminous Lotus\" cinnabar powder, separated by Kunlun paper. Seal the seams as before and place it in the ash pit. Nurture with fire for twenty-one days—the fire regimen is detailed in the following chapter. After cooling overnight, remove the cinnabar lumps, which will have all turned to gold. Place the purified gold cinnabar into a clean crucible, and as before, add two taels of mercury every seven days until the crucible is full. Remove the dried mercury from the top, use the medicine to nurture separately in the mother furnace, and refine the luminous lotus cinnabar into the treasure called \"Bone-Transforming Yang Cinnabar,\" whose efficacy is profound. This method is named the \"Golden Valley Seed.\"\n\n**Chapter Four: The Immortal’s Palm Moonlit Pool of Divine Cinnabar**\n\nPlace the Golden Valley Seed cinnabar into a crucible, add three taels of mercury, seal the seams as before, and place it in the ash pit. Nurture with fire for seven days. Add mercury until the crucible is full, then remove the pale yellow dried mercury from the top. The cinnabar and dried mercury beneath, totaling ten taels, serve as the mother for adding mercury—this mercury becomes the \"Longevity Gold Repository.\" Grind the pale gold mercury into powder, place it in a clean crucible, and layer it with equal parts of chalcanthite, halite, and ochre powder on the bottom and top. Seal the seams as before, nurture with fire for twenty-one days, and it will turn a deep red, becoming refined purple gold.\n\nIf the Golden Valley Seed cinnabar is ground into powder and mercury is added, it can be sown in the morning and harvested by evening, transforming into metal. Through further refinement, it becomes the \"Purple Palace Golden Lotus,\" whose efficacy is exceptional. It can generate both gold and silver smiles, and only then is it suitable for transmutation.\n\n**Chapter Five: The Purple Palace Golden Lotus of Divine Cinnabar**\n\nTake ten taels of Golden Valley Seed and place them in a crucible. To produce a gold smile, boil mercury with chalcanthite and add it—this yields gold-grade elixir. To produce a jade smile, boil mercury with alum and add it—this yields jade-grade elixir. Without boiling the mercury, adding it for seven days produces pale gold, though its qi is insufficient. Once the crucible is full, remove it, layer the top with dried mercury-gold powder as before, nurture it in the mother furnace, and melt it into high-grade yellow gold, becoming a treasure beyond this world.\n\nTake ten taels of Purple Palace Golden Lotus cinnabar as the mother, and as its generative qi becomes abundant, the added mercury will surge like a fountain.\n\n**Chapter Six: The Purple Palace Fountain of Divine Cinnabar**\n\nPlace ten taels of Purple Palace Golden Lotus cinnabar into a crucible, add three taels of mercury, and nurture it from dawn to dusk. Add mercury until the crucible is full, then remove the dried mercury-gold without further nurturing—it can then be refined and used to transform the five metals, all returning to their true nature.",

      "translated_text": "**Chapter Seven: The Sevenfold Return of Golden Liquor and the Reverted Elixir**\n\nTake ten taels of cinnabar-mercury from the lower crucible, augment it through seven returns, and it becomes the Sevenfold Return Golden Liquor—penetrating the profound and subtle mysteries of the Dao. Without innate immortal bones or the transmutative touch of a perfected being, one cannot attain this.\n\n**Chapter Eight: The Return-to-Origin Numinous Liquor Golden Elixir**\n\nGrind the reverted Golden Liquor Elixir into powder, place it in a clean crucible, seal it properly, and nurture it with fire for eight eights of days. Once the furnace cools, retrieve it and bury it seven feet underground to dispel the fire-toxin. After seven days, grind it finely into powder, mix with jujube pulp, and form into pellets the size of mung beans. If a person has died but not yet passed three days, pry open their mouth and administer one pellet—they will revive. Consuming it grants immortality. When used to transmute the five metals, all become supreme treasures.\n\n**Chapter Nine: The Ninefold Cyclic Golden Elixir**\n\nGrind the Numinous Liquor Reverted Elixir into powder, place it in a clean crucible, seal it properly, and nurture it with fire for nine nines of days. Once the furnace cools, retrieve it and bury it one *zhang* underground to dispel the fire-toxin. After fourteen days, grind it finely into powder, mix with jujube pulp, and form into pellets the size of mung beans. Consuming one pellet extends lifespan; two pellets grant longevity and enduring vision; three to five pellets transform the bones and lighten the body. Taking a hundred pellets allows one to ascend in broad daylight, attaining pure yang and transcending the mortal realm. If ten *jin* of black bismuth are melted in a cauldron over fierce fire until boiling thrice, and one *zhū* of the Ninefold Cyclic Essence is added, it instantly transforms into nine *jin* of white silver. If ten *jin* of mercury are heated in an iron cauldron, and ten taels of chalcanthite are added, boiling it several times before introducing five *zhū* of the Ninefold Cyclic Essence, it instantly becomes nine *jin* of refined yellow gold. Such is the verification of the Ninefold Cyclic Cinnabar. Consuming it allows one to ascend in broad daylight, ascend to the Golden Gates, and attend the Celestial Thearch. I now reveal this to you—guard it closely. To transmit it recklessly brings calamity upon nine generations.\n\nThe Most High Lord Lao once said: \"To withhold it from the worthy is called concealing a celestial treasure; to transmit it to the unworthy is called leaking celestial mechanisms. To violate either is to commit an unforgivable sin.\"\n\nAt that time, the Perfected One Baoji, having heard this, rejoiced exuberantly, bowed to the Perfected One, and with the assembly of all immortals, performed three prostrations in reverence. Praising and extolling, he recited:\n\nThe great medicine has no head,\nThe golden elixir cauldron has no ears.\nCreation requires no herbs,\nThe sacred embryo must be refined.\nOnly when true father and mother unite\nDo they align with the principles of heaven and earth.\nLater learners should ponder deeply,\nExamining each meaning with care.\nGold transforms into gold—\nA secret formula of the loftiest immortals.\nSilver transforms into silver—\nA revelation of the divine transcendents.\nWhen the work of creation is complete,\nGuard it closely and do not leak it.\n\nAfter the Perfected One Baoji offered this hymn, the assembled immortals rose from their seats, circumambulated him seven times to the left, and declared: \"We and all others here vow to receive and uphold this teaching, to deliver and liberate sentient beings.\" Bowing to the Perfected One, they paid their respects and withdrew, pledging to follow the instructions.\n\n**The Fire Regimen for Dual-Refinement Cinnabar: The Martial Fire Phase**\n\nWhen refining dual-refinement cinnabar, begin at the *yin* hour by applying four taels of fire, six taels at the *mao* hour, and half a *jin* at the *chen* hour. Continue increasing gradually to one *jin*, two *jin*, and three *jin*. Use a total of twenty-four *jin* of peeled, clean charcoal, then cease adding fire and replenish with water. By the *shen* and *you* hours, the cinnabar will naturally congeal. Nurture the fire for three more hours, then extinguish the charcoal and stop the water, allowing the fire to dissipate on its own. Lift the crucible from the furnace, and once cooled, select the hardened portions as the finest. If the furnace is too slow, refine it again with blue-green gold.\n\nThis is the martial fire regimen for crafting dual-refinement black cinnabar.\n\nThere is another method: When refining cinnabar, choose a day of the Four Executioners for great auspiciousness.\n\n**The Fire Regimen for Nurturing Cinnabar: The Civil Fire Phase**\n\nWhen nurturing numinous cinnabar with fire:\n- On the first day, apply two taels of top fire.\n- On the second day, apply three taels of top fire.\n- On the third day, apply four taels of top fire.\n- On the fourth day, apply five taels of top fire and four taels of side fire, totaling seven taels.\n- On the fifth day, apply four taels of top fire and one tael of side fire on each side, totaling half a *jin* of fire. Do not exceed this, lest the mother be harmed.\n- On the sixth and seventh days, apply fire at the *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you* hours, using half a *jin* each time, replenishing the new and removing the old.\n\nThis is the true civil fire regimen for nurturing the father and mother of cinnabar.\n\nWhen nurturing numinous cinnabar with fire:\n- On the first day, apply one tael of top fire.\n- On the second day, also apply one tael.\n- On the third day, add one and a half taels of side fire, totaling two and a half taels. Divide one and a half taels of mature fire into four strips, placing them about three finger-widths from the crucible on all four sides, separated by loose straw ash. Do not completely cover the fire with ash, lest it die. If the fire dies, promptly remove it with tongs and replace it according to the original weight.\n- On the fourth day, add three taels of side fire, dividing it into eight strips and placing them three finger-widths from the crucible, again separated by loose straw ash. On top of the crucible, pile ash three finger-widths high, place eight *qian* of mature fire beneath, and cover it with one *cun* of ash, leaving a small fire hole in the center to prevent extinction. Do not let the fire burn too fiercely, lest the mother be harmed.\n- On the fifth day, apply five taels of side fire, dividing the charcoal into twelve strips and arranging them evenly around the crucible, about two and a half finger-widths away. Separate them with loose straw ash as before. Apply one tael of top fire, totaling six taels. If the ash in the furnace has no fire and the top of the crucible has no charcoal, quickly use an iron spoon to stir the ash. Test it with your hand—if the ash feels like warm mud, wait briefly before adding fire according to the previous measurements.",

Spread it on five layers of fine paper, cover with raw silk, and bury it in damp earth for two to three *shi* (four to six hours) until it cools and hardens like iron. Then, crush it, place it in a crucible, and apply water above and fire below, gradually increasing the intensity over eight *shi* (sixteen hours) to refine the *erqi* (dual-qi) cinnabar. Use twenty-four *jin* of charcoal.\n\n**Method for Yin-Refining Erqi Cinnabar**\n- Yellow alum: two *qian*\n- White alum: two *qian*\n- Green salt: two *qian*\n- Sichuan pepper: two *qian*\n- *Diyu* (burnet): two *qian*\n- *Xixin* (asarum): two *qian*\n- Croton: two *qian*\n- *Paosha* (processed cinnabar): two *qian*\n- *Mingxin* (refined arsenic): one *qian*\n- *Wutou* (aconite): two *qian*\n- *Changpu* (calamus): two *qian*\n- Borax: two *qian*\n- Mulberry ash juice: three *sheng*\n- Vinegar: one *sheng*\n\nGrind the above ingredients finely and place them in a clay pot. Enclose the *erqi* lotus-seed cinnabar in a silk bag and suspend it in the pot to boil for one *fu* (ten days) as the standard duration. Afterward, store it in a sealed container for nourishment.\n\n*The Nine Cycles of Divine Cinnabar: The Great Elixir and Mysterious Classic of the Sage’s Resources* concludes.",
      "overlap_context": "five taels of side fire, dividing the charcoal into twelve strips and arranging them evenly around the crucible, about two and a half finger-widths away. Separate them with loose straw ash as before. Apply one tael of top fire, totaling six taels. If the ash in the furnace has no fire and the top of the crucible has no charcoal, quickly use an iron spoon to stir the ash. Test it with your hand—if the ash feels like warm mud, wait briefly before adding fire according to the previous measurements.",
