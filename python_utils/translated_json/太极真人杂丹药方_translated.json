A Tang dynasty work. One scroll. Base text from *The Orthodox Daoist Canon*, \"Comprehensive Arts\" section of the *Dongshen* Department.\n\n**Miscellaneous Alchemical Formulas of the Supreme Ultimate Perfected One**\n\nIn general, what is transmitted to men must be received with steadfast resolve and unwavering intent, guarding the tranquility of body and mind. Employ local ingredients, seal the crucible properly, and follow the furnace and bellows with precise fire and weight in refining. Thus, not one in ten thousand shall fail.\n\nThis formula must not be transmitted to those who are unjust, unprincipled, faithless, or unrighteous. The furnace and elixirs must be prepared in a secluded chamber, quiet and undisturbed, where no woman may enter, and no cock crows nor dog barks. The formula is transmitted to but one person per generation. The ingredients for the formulas, furnaces, and elixirs are listed as follows.\n\n**Qingyao Envoy**   **Blood of the Imperial Maiden**   **Pengsha**   **Beiting**\nGrind the above ingredients finely in a mortar. First, take the ground *Beiting* and boil it in mulberry ash lye until dry. Then, place the first two ingredients in a gold crucible with three taels of mercury, covering them with five taels of the aforementioned powdered medicines. Nurture with a gentle fire of five taels for three days. Once complete, refine with a strong martial fire until thirty catties reduce to seven, then cease. Place the gold crucible into an earthen pot, refining again with gentle and martial fires until the contents of the gold crucible liquefy. Once mature, pour into a mold, covering it with damp paper to cool. Remove, place in a fine crucible, melt thoroughly, add a pinch of saltpetre, then pour out and forge into a crucible. Nurture with gentle fire until mature, then add one catty of mercury. Refine with gentle and martial fires until it turns crimson and transforms into treasure. Its appearance resembles that of polished purple gold. Seven and five mark its position; eight and six, its secret.\n\n**Qingyao Envoy**   **Blood of the Imperial Maiden**   **Golden Star Taro**   **Golden Thread**, each five taels\nGrind the above ingredients into a fine powder and place them in a jar, sealing it with Six-One Clay as prescribed. Cover with a clean tile, sealing as before. Nurture with a gentle fire of four taels for three days, adding fire at the four daily intervals. Once the nurturing is complete, allow to cool, then remove and grind finely. Add six ingredients, grinding all into a powder. First, grind the seven ingredients into a fine powder and place them in a jar, nurturing for seven days. Once complete, use a jar with nine holes at the base, sealing with Six-One Clay as prescribed. Place in a flowing furnace, and once the elixir flows, determine its quantity. Offer fruits, fragrant tea, and white silk four feet nine inches in length as a sacrifice. Nurture in a gentle fire furnace for seven days. Once complete, each hole yields one tael.\n\n**Saltpetre**, three taels   **Niter**, two taels   **Foreign Red Alum**, one fen   **Pengsha**, one tael (of the finest quality)   **Foreign Alum of Great Term**, one tael   **Yellow Lead**, one fen\nThe above ingredients, sourced from local lands, are most excellent and infallible. Add six more ingredients, grinding all into a fine powder, and combine. Place in a jar as before, sealing properly. Nurture with a gentle fire for twenty-one days. Once complete, refine with a strong fire until red-hot, then nurture with ten catties of fire for twenty-one days. Once complete, refine again with a strong fire until red-hot, reducing ten catties to seven, then cease. Nurture in a yin furnace for one day. First, place one catty of mercury in a crucible, heating with gentle fire until mature. Add one fen of the medicine, then after the time it takes to cook a meal, add two fen, then cease. Thus, the treasure is formed. Eight and nine mark its position; four and five, its secret.\n\n**Method of the Golden Duke**\n**Red**   **Purple**   **Willow**   **Chicken**, each one tael (all locally sourced)   **Lead Sand**, two taels   **Yellow Lead**, one tael   **Gardenia Flower**, one tael\nGrind the above ingredients into a fine powder. First, seal the jar as prescribed. Then, place the medicine in the jar, covering it with a tile and sealing as before. Nurture with a gentle fire for seven days. Once complete, place in a flowing furnace. The furnace stands two feet four inches tall, using twenty catties of fire. Break the jar if it is of good quality, with nine holes at the base, sealing with Six-One Clay as prescribed. From dawn to night, cease. The elixir is fixed, yielding either one thousand or five hundred. Those with an orpiment hue, as large as millet grains, are nurtured in a small jar with niter weighing up to five taels. Nurture daily with four taels of fire for fourteen days. Once complete, sacrifice with utmost sincerity, using five-colored silks each thirteen feet long, and offering fruits, fragrant tea, wine, dried meat, jujubes, and the like. Success is assured only with utmost devotion. Once the sacrifice is complete, each pill weighs one tael. The secret of the elixir is two females and one male. The flowing furnace stands two feet four inches tall, with nine holes the size of a hairpin’s leg.\n\n**Silver Star Taro**, one fen   **Pengsha**, two taels   **Mercury**, one tael   **Iron**, one fen   **Chicken**, half a tael   **Kunlun**, one fen\n\nGrind the aforementioned ingredients finely into powder in a mortar, then place them into a vessel—the Tiger Vessel. Nurture with gentle fire for twenty-four days, applying twenty-four taels of fire daily. Once complete, increase the fire to twenty-eight taels, alternating between gentle and vigorous fire for thirty-five days. The elixir will then take on the hue of purple gold. Add three more ingredients, and its treasured nature will manifest instantly. This must not be transmitted lightly. Above, it communicates with the divine; below, it reaches the Nine Springs—all depends on the sincerity of one’s devotion.\n\nWhen adding the three ingredients, use raw medicinals: salt efflorescence, yellow lead, and bloodstone. Grind them finely into powder and blend them with the previous ingredients. First, place two catties of the base material into a crucible, then sprinkle one fen of the elixir powder atop it. Stir two hundred times with a green bamboo splint, then add one qian more of the elixir and stir thoroughly. Heat the mold pool until red-hot, add a small amount of oil, then pour the mixture into a trough and cover it with damp paper. The resulting substance will resemble mountain streams—marvelous indeed.\n\nMethod for using the vessel.\n\nTo the preceding method:\n\n**Peng, mercury, red cinnabar, blood-red quartz.**\nGrind these ingredients finely in a mortar until powdered, then place them into the Yellow Sprout vessel. Nurture them with gentle fire for one seven-day period. Thereafter, transfer them to the Yang furnace and refine with fierce fire, maintaining forty-two taels daily for seven days. Once complete, move them to the Yin furnace for three days, then allow to cool before removing.\n\nFirst, place one catty of the base material into a pot, then add two qian of the elixir. For two catties, add four qian. Stir with a willow twig three hundred times, then add more elixir and stir another three hundred times before stopping. Heat the mold trough over fire until hot, add a small amount of oil, then pour out the golden liquid. Cover with damp paper. The method proceeds separately.\n\n**To the preceding method:**\n\n**Peng, yellow lead, purple frost, cinnabar, realgar—equal parts.**\nGrind these ingredients in a mortar three hundred times until powdered. First, seal the crucible properly, then place the powdered medicinals inside and cover with a tile, allowing it to dry. Nurture the crucible with gentle fire for two seven-day periods, then allow to cool. Refine with fierce fire until glowing red; when twenty catties have reduced to approximately ten, cease. First, melt the preceding substance in a crucible, then add one qian of the elixir and stir one hundred times. Add another half qian of the elixir and stir again until ready. For every ten taels, use one and a half qian of the elixir. The number follows the seven-five position, and the secret lies in the six-three principle.\n\n**To the preceding method:**\n\n**Chicken, mercury, flowing lodestone, male azure, blood.**\n\nGrind the aforementioned ingredients into fine powder. Use a crucible as the vessel, and line its interior with white alum as the protective layer. Nurture with gentle fire until dry. Then place it within the \"Taiyang vessel,\" nurturing it for seven days, using one jin and four liang of firewood each day. One cycle suffices; two cycles suffice; cease at three cycles, by which time the medicinals will have turned a dark greenish-black. Remove and grind again in a mortar until powdered. Add half a liang of *lu* and place back into the crucible, nurturing together for one day. Then, within the \"Yang furnace,\" apply three jin of gentle fire until fully cooled. Refine with fierce fire until ten jin reduces to approximately seven jin, then cease, allow to cool, and remove. First melt the preceding substance in a crucible until liquefied, then add two jin of the medicinals with two qian of the elixir; for three jin, add five qian of the elixir. First heat the casting pool until hot, then add a small amount of oil, pour out the golden liquid, and cover with damp paper to form the treasure.\n\n**To the preceding method:**\n*Shu, liu, ji, white tiger brain, ci, yellow flower, solar essence, nitre, sacred stone*—each use half a liang; those sourced from *Zhou* soil are superior, while those from foreign vessels are finest.\n\nGrind the aforementioned ingredients into fine powder, and use white alum as the protective layer. The alum must be refined three times before use. Apply gentle fire, using four liang of firewood each day. After nurturing with gentle fire for seven days, then fierce fire for fourteen days, it will be ready for use.\n\n**Refining Furnace**\n**Furnace Consecration Method:** Use fruits, fragrant tea, white dried meat, wine, and five-colored silks each twelve feet long. Consecrate according to this method, and success will be certain.\n\n**To the preceding method:**\n*Liu, qing, imperial maiden’s blood, imperial youth’s essence, mercury, peng, ting.*\n\nGrind the aforementioned ingredients into fine powder with three hundred strokes, then cease. Grind again with one hundred strokes, then place into the White Tiger vessel, nurturing it until the ten fields are full. Remove and grind finely with two hundred strokes, then transfer into the Yellow Sprout vessel, nurturing for two seven-day periods until full. Then refine with fierce fire, transitioning from fierce to gentle—this is the method. When retrieving, use the eight-six position, for this is its secret. The method of refining with fierce fire has an additional forty-eight secrets, to be applied separately after the medicine is formed, yielding two to three *jin* per batch.\n\n**Overlapping with the preceding method:**\n*Blood-purple, Imperial Maiden, White Brain, Peng, Iron, Wave*\n\nPlace the aforementioned ingredients into a mortar and grind into fine powder, then transfer into the Sacred Stone vessel, nurturing for thirty-one days until full. Remove and grind finely as before. Then add the three ingredients *Flowing Vermilion* and *Peng* (three in total), and return to the vessel, nurturing for seven days until full. Refine with fierce fire until thoroughly red-hot, then cool and remove. When using, the method is applied separately: the six-number position is its place, and three-five is its secret, to be enacted when the medicine is ready.\n\nEach day, use six *liang* of gentle and fierce fire in alternation. Refine three *jin* and six *liang* of Sacred Stone, place into a clean mortar, and soak in two *dou* of clear water. Decoct until dry, then transfer into a jar, sealing it within bamboo. Pierce a hole the size of a goose egg, fill it with the medicinal powder, and cover with a tile. Place into the Yang furnace to nurture.\n\nWhen ready, grind finely in a mortar, mix with vinegar, and apply to the object—it will instantly become a treasure. Use one *liang* per *jin*.\n\nGrind the following ingredients—*he* (black lead), *peng* (borax), *ji* (cinnabar), *gong* (mercury), *huang* (sulfur), *xiao* (saltpeter), *bo* (mica), and *yu* (jade)—finely into powder in a mortar. Place into a jar and seal with Six-One Mud as prescribed. Cover with a tile and secure as before. First nurture with six *liang* of gentle fire for seven days. Once complete, remove and grind finely into powder, avoiding exposure to wind. Then add six additional ingredients and grind together as before. Place into a jar and nurture for two seven-day periods. When using, add one *qian* of the medicine per *jin* of substance, stirring thirty times with a mulberry stick until ready. The method is applied separately: three-six is its position, seven-eight is its secret.\n\nThe six additional ingredients are: *huangdan* (red lead), *liuhuang* (sulfur), *guanhua* (vermilion), *xueshi* (hematite), *baifan* (alum), and *daqi* (realgar).\n\nGrind the following ingredients—*peng* (borax), *gong* (mercury), *bo* (mica), *liu* (willow ash), and *zi* (purple mineral)—finely into powder in a mortar. Place into a Green Dragon Repository, with the upper repository sealed in a Hunan jar. Secure with a layer of Six-One Mud. Nurture with gentle and fierce fire for seven days, using twenty-four *liang* of fire daily. Once complete, add four additional ingredients and nurture together.\n\nThe four ingredients are: *liu* (flowing mineral), *hong* (red mineral), *gen* (lodestone), and *cishi* (magnetite). Combine with the previous medicine and grind four hundred times. Place into the repository as before and nurture with gentle and fierce fire for two seven-day periods. Once complete, refine with fierce fire until thoroughly red-hot, using thirty *jin* of fire to reduce by eight or nine parts. Cease firing, then cool and remove. Place into a Yin furnace for seven days. When using, first melt the prepared substance in a crucible, then add one *qian* of the medicine, stirring three hundred times with a mulberry sieve until ready.\n\nUse the following apparatus: Repository, Yin Furnace, Green Dragon Repository.\n\nHere follows the translation:\n\n---\n\n**Purple, White Blood, Flowing, Flower, Mercury, Basin, Yellow Flower**—method to be conducted separately.\n\nCombine the aforementioned ingredients with one *liang* of Yellow Sprout and one *liang* of mercury, grinding together until powdered. Place into the Yin furnace and nurture for two seven-day periods, applying six *liang* of gentle and fierce fire daily at six intervals, without allowing cooling. Once the days are complete, cool, then refine with fierce fire until thoroughly red-hot. After one *fu* period, the method is complete for that day; then transfer to the Yang furnace.\n\nFirst, heat the object until red-hot. For each *jin* of substance, use one *fen* of the medicine, mixed with vinegar. Apply the medicine to the object three to five times, and it shall become the supreme treasure.\n\n---\n\n**Great Period, Persian, Yellow Vitriol, Blood, Mercury, Sand, Basin Flower**\n\nGrind the first seven ingredients finely into powder, then place into a mulberry-wood repository and nurture for seven days. Remove and grind finely again. Add the previous two ingredients, grinding together into powder, then nurture in the repository for two seven-day periods as before. Refine with ten *jin* of gentle and fierce fire, reducing by seven *jin*, then cease. Cool and remove. First melt the red substance into liquid, then add one and a half *qian* of the medicine powder, stirring three hundred times with green bamboo until complete. Pour out to form the treasure.\n\n---\n\n**Flowing, Mercury, Blood, Red, Tile, Jade, Brain, Yellow Flower, Sage Stone**\n\nGrind the ingredients finely in a mortar until powdered, then place into a bottle and nurture for seven days. Afterward, add two ingredients to the previous medicine and nurture for two seven-day periods. Refine with fierce fire until red-hot.\n\nWhen using, first melt the substance in a crucible into golden liquid, then add the medicine. For each *jin*, use one *qian* of medicine. Heat the mold pool until hot, add a small amount of oil, then pour out the substance. Cover with damp paper, and it shall instantly become the treasure.\n\nAdditionally: Six *liang* of White Cinnabar Yellow Flower Cluster Flowing, two *liang* of fine cinnabar, a small amount of Gold Sprout ground together with the cinnabar, and six *liang* of yellow lead—cover these. At the appointed time, follow the method: take two *liang* of fine cinnabar treasure, two *liang* of sulfur, first refine the Black Tiger, then complete with the Crane. Pour out when fully formed to create the Treasure Elixir.\n\n---\n\n**Red, Great Period, Wave, Jade, Yellow, Blood, Stone, Gold Thread, Chicken Droppings, Kunlun, Purple**\n\nThe aforementioned ingredients are sourced as follows: the medicine from Guangzhou, white iron from Jinzhou, tiles from Chizhou, willow catkins from ships, the Blood of the Emperor’s Daughter from Wudu, the Green-Waisted Messenger from Mount Jingong, and white brain from Hunan.\n\nThe aforementioned ingredients are placed into a mortar and ground to a fine powder. First, seal the crucible securely, then add the ingredients, covering them with a tile as per the method. Seal it properly. Nurture it with civil and martial fire for seven days, then refine it with martial fire. When the firewood reduces from ten *jin* to seven *jin* or less, cease; the medicine is then complete. First, take an unspecified number of ancient coins, soak them in rice vinegar for seven days, then remove and fire them three times. Apply the medicine to them. The medicine is mixed with good vinegar, with the method to be followed separately.\n\nWrought iron foil, Green-Waisted Messenger, green vitriol, bloodstone, gold thread, and yellow vitriol. The aforementioned ingredients are simmered with civil and martial fire for three days.
