  "full_translation": "**The True Oral Instructions of Master Tizhen**\n\nRecorded by Wang Dongting, transcribed by Xuan Yin Waishi, a disciple from western Zhejiang.\n\nFor the preservation and nurturing of the body, one must prioritize the cultivation of spirit and the nourishment of qi. This is akin to planting a tree—one must first tend to its roots. Spirit and qi are the very foundation of our body. As the *Canon* states: *\"To manage and nourish the foundation, concentrate the spirit to form the body.\"* This foundation is the root of life.\n\nThe method of nurturing lies solely in gathering one’s spirit into the qi cavity. At present, your eyes are reddened, indicating heart-fire flaring upward, while below, essence leaks downward, signifying kidney-water draining away—both heart and kidney have been disturbed. If the lungs are further agitated, coughing will ensue, and consumption will take hold. Upon returning, you must apply yourself with utmost diligence, committing wholeheartedly to rigorous practice to achieve profound effects. Once the oral instructions are received, from this day forward, you will be able to prevent essence from leaking.\n\nDuring practice, if stray thoughts arise, do not be troubled. Know that stray thoughts are like falling leaves, while the union of mind and breath is an iron broom—sweeping as they fall, there will come a day when all is swept clean. There must be no beginning and no end; the longer the concentration, the more the acquired spirit submits, and the more the original spirit manifests.\n\nAvoid alcohol entirely—remember this well, for it disrupts one’s nature. *\"Illuminating virtue\"* is the single qi within emptiness, represented by the yang line (|). *\"Utmost goodness\"* is the void, represented by the yin circle (〇). *\"Resting in utmost goodness\"* is the union of yin and yang (〇|), the state of mind and breath in harmony.\n\nThe term *\"casting off the mortal coil\"* refers to shedding the ordinary breath of the mundane body, thereby transforming the acquired spirit of later heaven. When the work reaches fruition, the entire body becomes supple and soft, and the true yang of prior heaven enters. For every degree of yang that enters, a degree of yin retreats. Hence, the alchemical texts speak of *\"advancing the yang fire and retreating the yin tally.\"*\n\nWhen ordinary breathing ceases and spirit and qi settle into great stillness, this is the gentle fire of *\"bathing and nurturing.\"* When one reaches the state of primordial chaos, this is the union of heaven and earth. I asked what this meant, and the Master replied: When both body and mind are utterly still, your physical form is like the earth, which pertains to *kun*; the heavens outside pertain to *qian*. When the true qi of *qian*-yang from without reaches your body without obstruction, is this not the union of heaven and earth?\n\nWhen stillness reaches its extreme and movement arises, yang is born within the body, the yang-qi surges upward, and true fluid descends—this is the union of *kan* and *li*. The union of *kan* and *li* belongs to later heaven, while the union of *qian* and *kun* belongs to prior heaven. The union of *qian* and *kun* occurs externally, while the union of *kan* and *li* occurs internally. The union of *qian* and *kun* precedes that of *kan* and *li*.\n\nThe microcosmic orbit within the body must be cultivated to resemble Fuxi’s circular diagram, with nothing lacking and nothing in excess. *\"White clouds ascend to the upper palace\"* signifies qi surging upward. *\"Sweet dew sprinkles Mount Sumeru\"* signifies qi descending. As it is said: *\"Drizzling like spring rain, flowing like melting ice. From the head it streams to the feet, then ultimately ascends again.\"*\n\nThe true crucible and furnace are the union of mind and breath, which must be placed externally—if attached to the physical body, it is not genuine. A single void is independent, while the two of yin and yang are interdependent. That is all.\n\nFor those whose bodies are broken, the entire body above and below is yin, thus requiring the summoning of the true yang of the void to sustain life. When mind and breath unite in great stillness, the void of heaven and earth becomes one’s own void, and the true yang within the void naturally flows in unceasingly—how could one not attain longevity?\n\nThere will certainly be variations in duration. When the work is mastered, the entire body feels at ease, extending to three or four hours, reaching the macrocosmic orbit. If one can remain in stillness externally for a prolonged period, at the extreme of stillness, one can depart from stillness and project the spirit.\n\nThe method of learning immortality is nothing more than concentration. For every degree of concentration achieved, a degree of breathing is relinquished; for every degree of breathing relinquished, a degree of yin is removed; for every degree of yin removed, a degree of yang is added; for every degree of yang added, the original spirit gains a degree of clarity. As clarity increases, the spirit becomes more vigorous. When the spirit is complete, one naturally casts off the mortal coil.\n\nThe alchemical texts speak endlessly, yet all revolve around the union of mind and breath. Thus it is said: *\"A few words, not many characters—ten thousand volumes of immortal scriptures distilled into one phrase.\"*\n\nFrom the moment you rely on it, you can enter concentration. After three to five breaths, you enter concentration—at the very least, half a year of unwavering effort is required. From concentrating for two to three minutes to one or two hours, at least two years of unwavering effort are needed.\n\nIf there is a diseased area, when the true yang of heaven and earth arrives, that area will not become supple and soft. You must apply effort until it does, and the illness will be dispelled.\n\nThe study of the Dao begins with returning from later heaven to prior heaven, then from prior heaven to that which precedes prior heaven—only then is it called the Great Dao.\n\nAfter achieving concentration through the union of mind and breath, the mind and breath no longer require concentration to attain great stillness. In great stillness, one remains in great stillness; at the extreme of stillness, one can depart from stillness. Departing from stillness without clinging to departure is the projection of the spirit. Thus it is said: *\"To cross the river, one needs a raft; upon reaching the shore, the boat is no longer needed.\"*\n\nThe heart is but one—with thoughts, it is the human heart; without thoughts, it is the Dao-heart. Thus, in a single turn of thought, the Red Child becomes Sudhana the Youth, and the Bull Demon King returns to true awakening. It is merely a turning of the mind.\n\nThe Master said: *\"Turning the mind\"* means returning and reversing. Returning to my emptiness, restoring my nothingness—then the human heart returns to the Dao-heart. What difficulty is there?\n\nThe *\"tai\"* in *Taiji* refers to the one line, hence *Taiji* is represented by ⊙, while *Wuji* is represented by 〇.\n\nReversing Kan and Li is but the interdependence of heart and breath. The mutual overcoming of the Five Phases—water and fire in harmonious balance—all such forced designations need not be remembered. It is merely the interdependence of heart and breath. Intentional yet unintentional, this is called true intent. The fire-tending is subtle; I cannot transmit it to you now. When you have attained it, I will show you the minor celestial cycle. You must live with me to receive it. The cessation of fire is the same. You must reach the point where you can eat a little food with each meal, for when qi is full, one loses the desire to eat. Cunning intent is the most harmful thing. Project the spirit into the qi, without a trace of cunning intent—this is the method of beginning practice. Before seven days had passed, she said: \"My whole body is supple and blissful.\" I asked her: \"Are your breasts firm?\" She replied: \"My breasts are firm; yang has arisen.\"\n\nFor women without menstruation, practice must first restore it; then, from having menstruation, return to its absence—this is the reversion to the child-body. Expounding the *\"Mysterious Essentials: The Heavenly Mechanism of the One Secret\"*, the Master said: \"I tell you the true oral transmission (this means transmitting to you the empty space of one move—heart and breath interdependent externally), I point to the moon at the edge of the sky (this refers to true yang about to arise, like the moon on the third day). When the moon is full, the jade bud blooms (speaking of stillness reaching its extreme and generating movement, the primordial qi emerging from emptiness).\" One must swiftly gather it. Thus, \"moon full\" means the moon is complete, signifying that qi is abundant and the source is utterly pure.\n\nIf the heart is not settled, one may use the gradual method to remedy it. Fix the gaze on a single word or object without shifting; then the spirit remains external and cannot generate stray thoughts. When the heart is constantly external, stillness is achieved. The Master said: \"When body and heart are both still, one must not cling to the physical form—only then is it the primordial Dao. Place your spirit outside the body, interdependent with the breath; then spirit congeals and qi harmonizes, and body and heart become still. Without speaking of heart and breath interdependence, I transmit to her a method of beginning practice. Each day in meditation, follow Master Wu’s method: place the spirit outside, interdependent with the breath. After two months, her whole body became supple and blissful, though she knew not why. Later, she understood it was the effect of spirit and qi interdependent externally. When the spirit is placed in the external qi, it congeals; when spirit congeals, qi also congeals. Only then did she realize Master Wu’s method was truly profound.\n\nIn your practice, do not cling to the physical form in the slightest. When yang arises, swiftly move outward—this ensures nothing will go amiss. He also said: \"Simply place the spirit outside and practice; faintly perceive the breath’s ingress and egress—that is all.\" During practice, if the body trembles, it is good, but do not fixate on it or cling to it. He further said: \"When you feel trembling, move outward.\"\n\nThe *\"Book of Transformations\"* considers the chapter *\"Dao-Heart\"* most important, stating: *\"Forget the form to nourish qi; forget qi to nourish spirit; forget spirit to nourish emptiness.\"* These three stages of practice are unified by the word *\"forget.\"* Such teaching is unique in the alchemical texts. Forgetting is the state of samadhi. The purer the forgetting, the longer the samadhi. The longer the samadhi, the more the ordinary breath is transformed. The more the ordinary breath is transformed, the more the spirit becomes whole. When the spirit is whole, the embryo in samadhi becomes complete and the spirit emerges. Thus, the *\"Great Cavern Scripture\"* says: *\"Great samadhi perfects the true.\"*\n\nThe beginning and end of Dao cultivation are nothing more than transcending this single breath. Without breath, essence and life are entirely within my grasp, not governed by emptiness but by me—not by Heaven. Yet this single breath is not easily transcended. Thus, the methods of the major and minor celestial cycles are but expedient means to eliminate this breath. Without such methods, samadhi cannot be prolonged. As long as a trace of breath remains, the treasure of life is not yet one’s own. Therefore, one must strive to remain in samadhi every moment of the twelve hours, without the slightest breath of ingress or egress—this is the sign of the embryo’s completion, and emergence from samadhi is not far off. Emergence of the spirit is the primordial spirit leaving samadhi, moving freely.\n\nThe Way of the Golden Elixir is simply the method of the dead heart. When the heart dies, the spirit lives. Know that what dies is the human heart, the discriminating spirit. What lives is the primordial spirit, the Dao-heart. The so-called reversion to youth is the reversion of the discriminating spirit to the primordial spirit of non-knowing and non-awareness. Abiding thus, unmoving and quiescent, constantly clear and still—like a child of two or three—one will not die.\n\nHe also said: \"Reverting to the child-body, you must understand it is the dharma-body reverting to the child-body. Vague and unknowing, like an infant before speech. After practicing the major celestial cycle, this effect is achieved, enabling one to live for hundreds or thousands of years, while the physical body naturally becomes youthful and strong. The method of the dead heart is nothing more than samadhi. The longer the samadhi, the deeper the mystery. The discriminating spirit is increasingly subdued, and the primordial spirit increasingly flourishes. Eventually, the discriminating spirit is entirely transformed, the primordial spirit fully restored, and breath ceases—this is great samadhi. The day great samadhi is attained is the day the primordial spirit is fully restored, and the embryo is complete.\n\nAll major and minor celestial cycles are but expedient means to deaden the heart. Without circulating qi through the body’s microcosmic orbit, primordial qi is not restored. Without primordial qi, samadhi is not prolonged. Without prolonged samadhi, breath is not eliminated. Without eliminating breath, a trace of yin is not removed. If yin is not removed, yang is not complete.\"\n\nIf yang is not complete, the spirit does not flourish—how then can the embryo be perfected and the birth transcended? Thus, one must deepen the roots and strengthen the stem to practice this. This is the great Dao of cultivating both nature and life. Expediency and reality intermingle; the true and the illusory merge. Should one advance deeply, the wonders within defy full description.\n\nLaozi said: *\"Though one offers a great jade disc before a team of four horses, it is not worth sitting to advance in this Dao.\"* These are words of truth.\n\nAt first, one must subtly observe the breath’s ingress and egress in the outer emptiness, sustaining this for a brief moment before releasing and allowing it to flow naturally. If stray thoughts arise, return to this observation for another moment, then once more set the heart at ease—naturally, the heart will settle, yielding the effect of harmonious balance.\n\nIf, however, one fails to transform and does not know to release, stubbornly following the breath, one often ends up chasing it with the mind, thereby spoiling the practice. Those who grasp the complete method are truly rare as one in a thousand ages.\n\nWealth and honor, fame and rank—these can be bought with money. But this matter? Can wealth and honor be of use? King Yama never drags a man away; men rush to their deaths of their own accord. Alas!\n\nOnce stabilized, my Dharmakāya merges with the void, and the emptiness of heaven and earth fuses with the emptiness within me, extending to the emptiness of the Dharmadhātu. Void interpenetrates void, coalescing into one. Utterly undifferentiated, without beginning or end—how could one not attain longevity?\n\nThe Master further said: If you can stabilize for a single moment, your true master abides in the outer emptiness, nurturing for that moment, while your foul skin-bag becomes an empty dwelling. The true yang of heaven and earth then gathers ever more abundantly upon your physical form. As your primordial spirit is nourished by the primordial qi in the outer void, and your physical body is steeped and bathed in true yang, both body and mind are cultivated—this is called \"dual cultivation.\" Thus does one attain longevity. Dual cultivation means nurturing both within and without; these are two distinct matters. The more empty you become externally, the more true yang flows into your physical form—this moment is of immeasurable significance.\n\nYour consciousness, ever stirring within the body, conjures lustful thoughts and disturbs the sovereign heart. Therefore, the first step in Daoist practice is to expel it beyond the body and sustain it in the void. Once banished, the heart becomes empty; with the heart empty, the body becomes void, and the primordial yang-qi can then enter your form. In essence, it is the boundless primordial qi of heaven and earth that sustains this limited bodily frame. Steal day by day, pilfer moment by moment, and your body will naturally refine into pure yang—whether to become an immortal or a buddha rests entirely with you.\n\nThere is no such thing as fate in heaven and earth; if one fares poorly, it is merely attributed to fate. The Master further said: Gain and loss lie entirely with the individual—heaven and earth are impartial and selfless. For now, you must learn to seize the treasure of life. If you can enter the state of reverie within three to five breaths or seven to eight inhalations, no illness will dare assail you. This is what it means to seize the treasure of life.\n\nReverie and profound obscurity arise from the union of heart and breath; stabilization emerges from reverie and profound obscurity. The key to Daoist practice lies in \"perseverance and duration\"—neither can be lacking. The Master further said: Progress depends entirely on diligence; without diligence, one remains idle. Sincerity, silence, and softness are the essential principles of practice.\n\nThe Dao does not demand emptiness, yet emptiness naturally gravitates toward it. I do not seek to steal true yang, yet true yang comes of its own accord. Thus it is said: \"Gather with the gathering that does not gather; take with the taking that does not take.\" Laozi said: \"To seize, one must first give.\" How profound!\n\nThe Master further said: I do not strive to return to a childlike state, yet when the practice matures, one naturally reverts to it. That which is unknown in its workings is called \"prior to heaven.\" In short, it all depends on external application. Once the external practice is perfected, the physical body immediately yields results. Mastery arises from familiarity; the entire practice hinges on pure refinement.\n\nThe first through ninth sections of *Xingming Guizhi* expound on the principles of nature, blending the Three Teachings into one. The Master further said: The second section, *Anshen Zuqiao*, discusses the practice of life cultivation.\n\nAt that time, Master Wu told me: *Xingming Guizhi* is exceptionally well-written and worth studying. Read *Journey to the West* thoroughly, and all the details of fire-phasing practice will become clear—it is a truly extraordinary Daoist text. Master Wu also said: If you wish to read, studying *Journey to the West* alone will suffice.\n\nHe further said: \"Wukong\" means awakening to true emptiness. \"Wu-zhen\" means awakening to the true yang within true emptiness. Only by attaining utmost emptiness can one align with the non-empty virtue—this is the essence of awakening to truth.\n\nMaster Wu explained the two lines by Wu Chongxu: \"Aware yet unaware, reawakening to the primordial.\" Some texts write \"true mystery\" (*zhenxuan*), others \"true origin\" (*zhenyuan*)—which do you think is correct? I replied: \"Xuan.\" The Master said: No, it should be \"yuan.\" I asked why. He said: \"Yuan\" means emptiness.\n\nI earnestly requested an explanation of these two lines. The Master smiled and said: You explain it to me first. I said: I cannot. He smiled again and said: Try. I replied: In the full context, \"aware yet unaware\" means that when yang first arises, it is too tender to be gathered immediately. \"Reawakening to the primordial\" means that when yang is at its peak, one should seize it without delay. The Master said: Then the term \"true origin\" is unnecessary. I said: \"True origin\" refers to yang-qi. The Master said: That is how all alchemical texts explain it—you’ve merely read it in books. I said: Even Chongxu himself explained it this way, as did Liu Huayang. Even in your own *Xingming Yaozhi*, you explained it thus—how can it be wrong? The Master said: I’ve told you before—do not trust alchemical texts entirely. These two lines are just child’s play.\n\nAfter repeated inquiries, he finally said: Let me explain.\n\n\"The character *jue* 'awareness' refers to the moment when timing arrives and spirit knows—it speaks of the living noon hour. As for *bu jue* 'unawareness,' when the primordial chaos is about to divide, if there is any movement, it is precisely the state of *huanghu yaoming* (indistinct and obscure), the functioning of the primordial. This 'awareness within unawareness' is true awareness. If one arises in great luminous awareness, one has already fallen into the postnatal—this is not the awareness of the primordial *huanghu* state.\n\nI have already instructed you: when you are muddled and confused, that is it.\n\nAs for *fu* 'reawakening,' you must further know that when yang arises below, only then are both yin and yang complete. Thus, the preceding line speaks of the living noon hour, while the following line speaks of the living midnight hour. If you cling to awareness the moment you become aware, you still do not know that yang is arising below. If yang does not arise, there is yin but no yang—therefore, you must have two awakenings. When you are in quiescent concentration and become vaguely aware, you need only recognize that yang is arising below, then swiftly extend it outward to where heart and breath interdepend. This is called the 'true origin,' represented by the circle 〇. The outward movement is what is meant by 'sending it back to the earthen cauldron, sealing it firmly.'\n\nI observe that in recent times, when practitioners reach the point of yang arising, they often err by being too hasty, having only one awareness and not two. They may happen to recognize it once, then rush outward to interdependence, yet still do not truly know that yang is arising below. This results in having mercury but no lead, yin but no yang—how can this succeed?\n\nThe Master said: I would not explain this unless you had reached this stage. Today, I have told you again—now do you understand? When yang arises, proceed according to the method. In short, the moment you become aware, you need only recognize that yang is arising below. Though there are two awakenings, in reality there is only one—'mercury and lead arise in the same place.' If you wish to speak of principle, then there is a distinction between two awakenings. But if, at that moment of recognition, you immediately proceed to the place of the true origin outside, what distinction of two awakenings remains? However, because scholars err by being too hasty—knowing only mercury and not lead—I speak of it in this way. Once this single point is clear, when the time comes for union, yin and yang will naturally be complete. If I did not explain this to you, you would not realize it on your own.\n\nI said: Without a master’s clarification, the fire phases of the golden elixir are truly difficult to comprehend on one’s own. When we previously reached the point of yang arising, Master Wu instructed me to wait until yang arose, then swiftly proceed outward. Be quick, he said—for if you delay even slightly, it becomes postnatal and unusable. I took his word for speed to heart: every time yang stirred, I immediately rushed outward, fearing attachment to the body. I pulled desperately in the void, pulling well, and yang would invert after seven or eight breaths; pulling poorly, even after dozens of breaths, the external yang would not invert.\n\nThe Master laughed and said: Without awakening, how could you possibly succeed? That is why, at the time, whenever I practiced, I would feel discomfort in that very place, and Master Wu would correct me.\n\nThe Master said: Without following a master’s instructions, success is utterly impossible. Errors must be corrected on the spot.\"\n\nThe term \"Small Heavenly Circuit\" (小周天) actually originated in Daoist texts from the Yuan and Ming dynasties; it did not exist prior to the Tang and Song. Wu Chongxu later expanded upon it greatly, introducing concepts such as the \"minor medicine\" and \"major medicine.\" Zhang Xuqing’s writings are commendable, as he begins by discussing the void from the very outset. In the study of the Dao, if one can \"kill life,\" that alone would suffice. These two characters, \"killing life,\" encompass the entire elixir formula.\n\nPure Yang Ancestor said: \"Having been born, kill life; before dying, learn death—then you attain longevity.\" Learning death is precisely what \"killing life\" means. If one can kill life, one can attain longevity. I asked what \"killing life\" meant. The Master replied: Abandon this physical form, fix your awareness outside, and cling not even slightly—this is killing life. Killing life is the death of the heart-mind. When the heart-mind dies, the spirit lives. Great death brings great life. Yet to die to the heart-mind, one must first abandon the body. Forget things, forget form, enter profound and enduring stillness—stillness so deep that not even a wisp of breath remains, where inner and outer senses and their objects are all stilled. This is the art of dying to the heart-mind.\n\nThe myriad volumes of elixir scriptures all speak of nothing but abandoning the body and forgetting form. If you can truly discard this foul skin-bag and become utterly selfless, you will attain the Dao. The key is to forget things and forget form, to be empty and natural. At the outset of practice, you may faintly perceive its ebb and flow, but you must place it in the void outside, allowing not even a thread of attachment to the mouth or nose. If you can rely on this for even a moment, you will naturally forget breath; once breath is forgotten, let it be as it will.\n\nThe Master said: At first, you must apply some intention, but after a day or two, you should no longer need to use intention—it will naturally follow. With time, it becomes effortless, and no intention is required. Stillness alone will make it follow. Advancing further, you enter the state of indistinct obscurity. When you sleep at night, what you obtain is true yin, the true yin of Heaven and Earth—not true yang. Consider this: the vitality you use throughout the next day is inexhaustible, for true yin has already proven its great efficacy. How much more so when both body and heart-mind are still, drawing in the two numinous substances of Heaven and Earth’s true yin and true yang? How could this not extend life and enhance longevity?\n\nHe also said: When both body and heart-mind are still, sleeping at night brings bodily stillness. With bodily stillness, one can draw in Heaven and Earth’s true yin, which serves as postnatal mercury, becoming the vitality for the following day. When it is exhausted, fatigue returns, and one must sleep again. When sleep reaches profound stillness, true yin is once more drawn into the body. Thus, activity by day and stillness by night. Between movement and rest, one’s vitality is regulated, allowing work to continue without cease.\n\nWhen people grow weary, they often say they need rest. But where do they go to rest? Sitting in a chair or lying on a couch is merely resting the body, not true rest. True rest refers to the spirit and qi. When the spirit labors, the body tires, so the spirit must be placed within qi to rest. When the spirit is nourished by qi and qi is harmonized by the spirit, both spirit and qi become still. Placing them outside the body—this is true rest. Spirit and qi are a devoted couple; when they daily enter the state of indistinct obscurity, I preserve the Great Ultimate and extend my life.\n\nThe world does not understand what the two characters \"clarity and stillness\" mean, yet they go off to practice stillness techniques. Little do they know that \"clarity and stillness\" are the two characters for \"dual cultivation.\" Clarity means clarifying the heart-mind; stillness means stilling qi. When the heart-spirit is placed outside the body, the heart-mind becomes clear and qi becomes still. Heart-mind and breath must rely on each other, existing in the space between intention and non-intention. The greatest danger is clinging without transformation, becoming attached and igniting the fire.\n\nMencius said: \"Neither forget nor assist\"—these four characters perfectly capture the subtlety of breath regulation. When spirit and breath rely on each other and reach equilibrium, this is \"neither forgetting nor assisting.\" Once this state is attained, breath naturally becomes harmonious, and the spirit naturally enters the state of indistinct obscurity. This is the initial step in mastering the art of reliance. When the work of reliance becomes pure and refined, it must transition into the forgetting of spirit and qi before one can enter samadhi. If one cannot forget spirit and qi, one cannot enter samadhi. Thus, this character \"forgetting\" is of utmost importance.\n\nSleep is the first verification of reliance. But if heart-mind and breath cannot both be forgotten, one cannot sleep. If one cannot even sleep, how can one attain samadhi? This method of heart-mind and breath relying on each other is the fruit of true cultivation, a personal attainment. It is truly a treasure beyond price, not to be taken lightly. Many ancients sought the Dao and teachers their entire lives without success.\n\nCommenting on the *Book of Changes* passage: \"Qian is easy to know, Kun is simple in its ability; through ease and simplicity, the principles of the world are attained,\" the Master said: It is merely the harmonious fusion of heart-mind and breath. I say: \"Heart-mind and breath relying on each other outside\"—these seven characters. Master Wu said: To have heart-mind and breath rely on each other outside, and to do so until it dies without becoming an obstacle—this is an even more advanced instruction.\n\nZhang Ziyang said: \"Thus, the method of the Great Elixir is most simple and easy. Even the dullest of men, if they obtain and practice it, will immediately transcend to the realm of the sages. Therefore, Heaven guards its secrecy and does not permit its careless transmission to the unworthy.\" Stone Apricot Grove’s *Returning to the Origin* preface states: \"In former years, at a post station, I encountered the immortal master Zhang Ziyang. With simple and easy words, no more than half a sentence, the effects of verification appeared in an instant. Knowing that immortality could be learned, I privately rejoiced.\"\n\nWhat is meant by \"simple and easy\" is the unity of spirit and qi outside. Spirit relies on qi, and qi relies on spirit—this is simplicity and ease in the extreme. If one practices without seeing results, it is because one has not yet aligned with the natural path.\n\nThe spirit and qi must naturally depend on each other, naturally unite as one—then with a single moment of stillness, one enters the boundless, indistinct realm of reverie. Cultivating the Dao is like playing chess, yet the most crucial thing is self-realization. Though a master may transmit the method, one must practice it oneself. Once mastery is achieved, skill arises naturally, and step by step, effects become evident. If one were to foretell each step’s verification in advance, it would be like chewing food for another to eat—utterly unpalatable.\n\nThe world does not understand what the two words \"emptiness\" and \"nothingness\" mean, and so falls into the trap of dull vacuity. How could they know that these two words are the essential secret of self-cultivation, the subtle principle of dual cultivation of nature and life? \"Emptiness\" means emptying the heart; \"nothingness\" means forgetting the body. Empty the heart, and the spirit becomes clear; forget the form, and the qi becomes still.\n\nLaozi gave Peng Qiu a linked ring, instructing him to fiddle with it idly. If the ring could be undone, then the person would also be liberated—this is the image of the interdependence of heart and breath. If one can forget both heart and breath, entering samadhi with ease, then the ring’s interdependence exists externally, and samadhi too exists externally. The various methods of elixir refinement are all practiced externally. When you have breath, you rely on it externally; when you have no breath, you settle externally. These two phrases suffice.\n\nIt is further said: Whether there is breath or not, you need not arrange it—simply follow the natural course. When there is breath, you rely on it externally; when there is none, you settle externally. This is called \"true emptiness refining the form.\" When yang arises and you feel a slight stirring in the outer kidneys, swiftly rely on it externally—this must be as quick as lightning, without hesitation or distraction. Rely until the stirring subsides, then settle again. Settle until the settling no longer drifts, then cease the practice. Do not rise immediately after the outer kidneys retreat; one must continue settling, so that the primordial qi felt within the body may also find its place in the acquired. If one ceases practice as soon as yang arises, the primordial qi, though obtained, will not yet have stabilized within. Thus, settling after yang arises is crucial.\n\nIt is also said: Settle once before yang arises, and once after. The great Dao of the primordial is the unity of spirit and qi. Therefore, in movement, spirit and qi are one; in stillness, spirit and qi are one. Through the interdependence of heart and breath, they settle together in the void, entering samadhi and the realm of ultimate emptiness. When stillness reaches its extreme, movement arises spontaneously. Thus, when qi moves, spirit awakens—what is called \"when the time comes, spirit knows\" is the simultaneous movement of spirit and qi. If, upon movement, one chases after delusion, they become two. If, upon movement, one does not chase after delusion but swiftly relies externally—meaning unites as one—it remains primordial, hence called \"continuing samadhi with samadhi.\" The interdependence of heart and breath is the settling of spirit.\n\nIt is further said: When spirit and qi are in great samadhi, qi moves and spirit awakens, about to depart from samadhi and separate into two. If I rely externally, I continue this samadhi, preventing separation into two, thus remaining united. At the first stirring of yang, one must not waver in thought; aligning with the natural sign, one immediately relies externally. This must be natural, decisive as a single stroke cleaving in two—how swift, how effortless! If the execution is even slightly delayed, doubt arises, and the blade cannot fall. The same applies to yang’s arising: when the outer yang stirs, hasten to rely on the breath externally, severing all ties in one stroke, leaving no lingering attachment. The slightest hesitation or delay will ruin it. In sum, only by achieving naturalness can skill and wonder arise.\n\n**Question on passing the barrier:**\nThe master said: What barrier? Do you think it refers to the twin barriers of the spine? This is a metaphor for traversing the great celestial cycle, where in the final days, there is a difficult barrier to pass. If you can settle externally, remaining utterly unmoved, empty and ever more empty, then no barrier cannot be passed. If even the slightest attachment remains to the body, the barrier cannot be crossed. You must leave the household—only by not recognizing the household can you find stability. When cold and heat assail you, your head aches as if splitting, your whole body trembles. At this moment, if you can practice the interdependence of heart and breath, all will be well. If you have not worked diligently in ordinary times, you will be utterly unable to practice at this moment, for heart and breath will have no mastery and cannot depend on each other. Only when you reach this point and still maintain control over heart and breath have you truly refined yourself to mastery. As soon as you begin practice, after ten or so breaths, your head no longer aches, your body no longer feels cold or heat, and your trembling ceases—you may then sink into deep sleep.\n\nThe master said: Your head may still ache, your body may still tremble, but your spirit is entirely external, so you do not feel it. Once yang arises, illness is transformed and dispelled. This is called \"having mastery over nature and life; my nature and life are in me, not in heaven.\" One must treat illness before it manifests; once it has manifested, it is difficult to cure. If you practice daily, and today you feel unwell or a part of your body is stiff, you know that illness has taken root there. Apply the work of emptiness upon emptiness, ensuring that part becomes supple—then the illness departs. Thus, those who study the Dao practice daily and remain free of illness, for even the slightest affliction is detected during practice and cured immediately. How could serious illness arise? This is treating illness before it manifests.\n\nThe master said: Once, while traveling, I contracted malaria and recovered after a day’s rest. In short, once you enter stillness and yang arises, all illnesses fall away.\n\nWhen externally, one relies on breath until it becomes soundless. The reason there is sound during sleep is that the heart cannot govern the qi. Every night as I sleep, I instruct someone to listen closely by the bedside to my nasal breath—no trace of sound is heard, just like an infant. With this practice sustained over time, one’s self-cultivation takes root. Thus, in movement and stillness, waking and sleeping, heart and breath unite as one, just like an infant. If tonight there is sound in my nasal breath during sleep, my family will know I am ill. When heart and breath fail to unite, I practice the next day until yang arises, and the illness departs.\n\nEssence, qi, and spirit—of these three, spirit is the Supreme Ultimate. Essence is yin, qi is yang, the two poles of the Supreme Ultimate. Moreover, when spirit resides within essence, it is called *spirit-essence*; when within qi, it is called *spirit-qi*. In sum, spirit is the commander, the marshal of essence and qi. When spirit is overused, it wearies; when essence is overused, it depletes; when qi is overused, it withers. To nourish these three, one must harmonize and cultivate them together. When heart and breath externally unite as one, then in the state of profound trance—where all is indistinct and boundless—essence, qi, and spirit deeply enter the primordial realm, which is the very barrier of my body. Nourishing them day by day, one draws forth the primordial yang of heaven and earth. How could one not attain longevity? Though we elders have exhausted the mechanism of cyclic generation and procreation, we can still replenish it and avoid irreversible decline.\n\nWhen circulating the minor celestial orbit through the body, if one has previously leaked essence even once, one must complete a full orbit to replenish it.\n\nYou ask what principles are taught in the first seven chapters of *Journey to the West*? I confess I do not understand—pray, enlighten me.\n\nMaster Wu began: Do you know Sun Wukong? Wukong was born in the Eastern Continent of Superior Beings, studied the Dao in the Western Continent of Cattle-Gift, and later proclaimed himself the Great Sage Equaling Heaven. After battling the True Lord Erlang, he was captured by Lord Laozi’s lasso and brought back to heaven, where he was placed in the furnace. What is the meaning of this?\n\nI replied that I did not know.\n\nMaster Wu asked: Have you read *Awakening to Reality*?\n\nI have read *Awakening to Reality*, but I do not understand it.\n\nMaster Wu said: The first seven chapters of *Journey to the West* are based on a poem from *Awakening to Reality*—can you recall which one?\n\nAfter pondering for a moment, I could not identify it, so I asked him to point it out.\n\nMaster Wu said: Sun Wukong’s birth in the Eastern Continent of Superior Beings is “The Metal Elder is originally the Eastern House’s son.” His journey to the Western Continent of Cattle-Gift to study the Dao is “Sent to the Western neighbor to lodge the body and give birth.” The Patriarch then tells him, “Go back!” Wukong asks, “Where should I go?” The Patriarch replies, “Return whence you came.” Wukong suddenly awakens, somersaults back to the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit—this is “Recognizing the call, return to the dwelling to nurture.” Later, he battles the True Lord Erlang. Two is the generative number of fire, and with six brothers, they make seven. Seven is the consummate number of fire, representing true yin, while Wukong is true yang. Wukong’s fight with Erlang is “Matching the Maiden in conjugal harmony.” Thereafter, he is captured by Lord Laozi’s lasso and placed in the furnace—this is “Sent back to the earthen crucible for secure sealing.”\n\nI thought to myself that this must be the correct interpretation—was I right?\n\nUpon hearing this, I realized such an explanation had never crossed my mind, not even in dreams. I immediately bowed and addressed him as Teacher.\n\nWhen an infant is first born, it is purely yin. After five days, it can perceive fire, for it has acquired a trace of yang. Thus, after birth, the child sleeps, stealing the yang of heaven and earth. Newborns know only eating and sleeping, stealing primordial yang day and night. After five days of theft, the root of yang qi forms within, enabling them to see fire—this is yang. Pure yin and pure yang cannot stand in opposition or disdain, for they fear the light of yang. Through such attraction, yang qi grows daily, reaching fullness at sixteen. From one to ten years old, one not only steals the true yang of heaven and earth but also their true yin. After the body is broken, primordial yang leaks away daily, and when it is exhausted, death follows. In sum, emptiness seizes it, emptiness revives it, emptiness kills it—the power of life and death lies with emptiness, not with me.\n\nThe sage teaches people to return, which is the act of stealing from heaven and earth, seizing the workings of creation. *Return* means reclaiming true yin, drawing it from emptiness back into the self. *Restore* means restoring true yang, likewise retrieving it from emptiness into the body. Know that heaven and earth do not merely steal my true yang but also my true yin. After the body is broken, both true yin and true yang are clearly stolen by emptiness. Thus, if one seeks to reclaim them, how can one not begin with emptiness? What is lost must be sought where it was lost to return it to its rightful owner—this is self-evident.\n\nPlaying the zither and fishing are both beneficial to body and mind, promoting longevity by dispelling distracting thoughts. Playing the zither calms the heart, and since the eyes must focus on the subtle movements of the strings, stray thoughts do not arise. When fishing, the eyes remain fixed on the float, the mind undistracted, the spirit externalized—this too eliminates stray thoughts. With long practice, the heart becomes still, the spirit settled, and when the spirit is settled, qi harmonizes—this is the natural course.\n\nMy elder brother, now over eighty, still resides in Anhui. Every morning, he plays the zither for half the day, and in the afternoon, he strolls with neighbors, walking over ten *li*. His spirit is vigorous, his steps light—he owes much to the zither. My teacher told me: You should learn the zither in the future; once you do, your practice will become easier.\n\nCultivating the union of heart and breath is no simple task. For people like us, it is entirely the result of bitter toil, reaching our present state. Without relentless effort, could we have succeeded?\n\nScholars often cannot forget the self. Laozi said: “The reason I have great trouble is that I have a body. If I had no body, what trouble would I have?” These two words—*forgetting the self*—are the key to the great Dao. The union of heart and breath is nothing more than using this to place the spirit outside the body, forgetting this physical form.\n\nI asked about true emptiness and stubborn emptiness.\n\nThe teacher said: True emptiness is when spirit and qi settle together outside, unattached to the physical body. Stubborn emptiness is clinging to the physical body. Abandoning this body leads to true emptiness; clinging to it results in stubborn emptiness.\n\nIn sleep practice, after falling asleep, one continues the practice and sleeps again. After ten days of such sleep, one no longer needs to sleep, and further practice leads to samadhi. Skill comes from familiarity. This skill has no oral formula.\n\nThe *Cantong Qi* states: *\"The four trigrams of yin and yang serve as bellows.\"* The teacher said: If you can grasp the opening six lines of the *Cantong Qi*, the entire text is contained within them. I earnestly begged the teacher to expound further.\n\nThe teacher said: *\"Serve as bellows\"*—when explained in its true sense—is nothing other than the union of heart and breath. Yet Master Wei [Berkong] spoke in terms of the heavenly Dao, making it difficult to comprehend—truly formidable. The entire *Cantong Qi* revolves around these two lines, and the ten thousand volumes of alchemical texts all trace back to them. What I tell you now, without a true master’s illumination, would remain utterly incomprehensible. Even a *zhuangyuan* would be of no use here—what method could you employ to interpret it? The difficulty lies precisely in the phrase *\"the four trigrams of yin and yang.\"* If it had said *\"the two trigrams of Kan and Li serve as bellows,\"* it would be easier to explain. But alas, that would not encompass the dual cultivation of *xing* and *ming*. You may know the four trigrams, not just two, and still pass the imperial examination—but if asked about these two lines alone, you would remain utterly lost.\n\nI again entreated the teacher to expound the opening six lines in full. The teacher replied: I will explain them to you.\n\n“Qian and Kun are the gates and doors of the *Yi*, the father and mother of all trigrams.” The next two lines—*“Kan and Li frame the void, turning the hub and aligning the axle”*—refer to King Wen’s Later Heaven arrangement of the eight trigrams, with Li in the south and Kan in the north, describing the circulation of spirit and qi within the physical body. These four lines first clarify the internal and external, the Earlier and Later Heaven, which is what is meant by *“two layers of heaven and earth, four yin and yang.”* This is spoken in terms of duality and belongs to the Dao of the *Yi*. The following two lines—*“the four trigrams of yin and yang serve as bellows”*—are where Master Wei harmonizes Earlier and Later Heaven into one, which is the Dao of internal alchemy. The first four lines are based on the *Book of Changes*, while the latter two are Master Wei’s original insight—truly formidable. With these two lines alone, the ten thousand volumes of alchemical texts need not be read. For the principle of dual cultivation is not one matter but two. Hence it is said: *“Heaven and man unite in activation.”* One must place the heart and breath outside in the emptiness to rely upon, so that Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li merge into one—this is *“the four trigrams serve as bellows,”* and it is also the meaning of *“heaven and man unite in activation.”* In short, it is the cultivation of both the dharmakāya and the physical body. When both inside and outside the body are placed into emptiness to practice, they harmonize into one. Heart and breath rely on each other, always outside, subtly aware of each inhalation and exhalation. At first, some intention must be used, but with familiarity, intention is no longer needed. If slightly tightened outside, what harm is there? As long as one does not cling to the physical body, all is well. At first, tightening is necessary, but with familiarity, it will naturally follow. I fear you cannot leave the physical body—once you cling to it, danger arises. Do not indulge in idle talk of the Dao without practicing. If a grave illness strikes and you cannot work, alas, death follows. What benefit is there?\n\nI learned medicine through illness and the Dao through study. First, I read the *Dao De Jing*, the *Yin Fu Jing*, and other classics. *Journey to the West* was written after the Hongwu era, for many events occurred during that time. Always place the spirit outside, muddle through with it in a dead earnest effort—only then can true mastery be achieved. The union of heart and breath, brought to perfection, cannot be accomplished in a day or a night. It requires accumulated days and months of effort, persistence in diligence and constancy, and a resolve that is sincere to the end. The work must be done until you can no longer control it yourself—then it is well. Those who have completed the microcosmic orbit can project their spirit, though it is only a yin spirit, not some strange phenomenon. For when qi abides, spirit abides; when spirit abides, form abides. When heart and breath rely on each other and merge into one, all three abide. The projected spirit is the spirit in dreams transformed into pure yang—wherever intention arises, there it goes. To conceal or reveal, all follows one’s will.\n\nThe teacher said: The spirit in dreams must be mastered by you. He also said: Keep the spirit long settled outside, accumulating days and months until it becomes one with the Great Void. Naturally, there will be scenes of spirit projection in emptiness—this is the moment of departure. Spirit projection is leaving samādhi; abandoning samādhi is called the scene of spirit projection, where one sees the six directions in swirling flight. When first projecting the spirit, one should remain in samādhi longer and project for shorter periods, proceeding step by step from near to far. With maturity, there is no longer any concern. The clever always possess sharpness, which is the greatest obstacle in learning the Dao and must be avoided in practice. You must learn to be dull and foolish—only then can you truly practice. You may fix your gaze on a single character in a book, disregarding whether heart and breath rely on each other, as long as you focus on that one character without arising thoughts. For as long as you fix your gaze, the spirit remains outside. Always train to keep the spirit outside until it becomes familiar, then proceed to unite heart and breath—this will prevent clinging to the physical body. Practice this for three hours daily; falling asleep is best. When this work is perfected, the heart becomes still. When refinement of the self is complete, there are no dreams. After long absence of dreams, if a dream suddenly occurs, it is a true dream.\n\nDiscard all alchemical texts at once and focus solely on practice. Do not seek widely or study broadly—this is the truth. It is always this wretched skin-bag that causes trouble. If you can go beyond it, what harm is there?\n\nMaster Wu said: The union of heart and breath must be outside, practiced until it dies and is no longer an obstruction—this is the most crucial step in refining the self. The oral instructions for practice are divided into three stages of transmission. The first stage is the initial method; the second stage includes the transformations of fire phases and the microcosmic orbit; the final transmission comes last. Xu Jieqing had already received the second transmission, but alas, he did not practice and died.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* says: *“Occupy the correct position and abide in the body,”* and also *“Occupy the correct position and congeal destiny.”* This *“correct position”* is the one point of emptiness. *“Correct position”* is the image of the central point. Master Ge Xianweng said: *“Where Qian and Kun unite is the true center,”*—is this not the one point of emptiness? *“Abide in the body”* means to concentrate the spirit within it. *“Congeal destiny”* means that when the spirit relies on the breath for a long time, qi and breath become still, neither exiting nor entering.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* also says: *“Great centrality, with emptiness above and below.”* *“Great centrality”* is also the one point of emptiness in the center. Above is Qian, below is Kun, and the space between is emptiness—where Qian and Kun unite. Hence it is said: *“Emptiness above and below.”*\n\n\"Yellow Sprout and White Snow\" are metaphors for the two medicines of true yin and true yang—these are not the tangible, visible gold and silver. The alchemists of the furnace and fire deceive the world with their \"yellow-and-white\" arts, claiming secret methods to transmute gold and silver. How could they ever grasp the wondrous cultivation of *\"From emptiness arises White Snow, from stillness blooms Yellow Sprout\"*?\n\nThe man who wrote the *Family Treasure* in four collections lived to be over one hundred and sixty years old. He understood the external technique but knew nothing of the interdependence of heart and breath. He nourished his postnatal self quite well, meticulously attending to every aspect of his diet.\n\nThe Master said: Understanding the external technique means projecting the spirit outward—this is neither true emptiness nor dull emptiness. If you grasp the interdependence of heart and breath externally, your breathing ceases, your qi settles profoundly, and inner and outer become utterly still. With body and mind unmoving, that is true emptiness. Once true emptiness is attained, creation begins: the external true yang comes to your body, embracing your dharmakāya and nurturing your physical form. This moment of effort is extraordinary. How much more so if you remain in true emptiness at every instant? Even if you wished not to become immortal, could you avoid it?\n\nThe Master sighed: Those who study the Dao externally are as numerous as ox hairs, yet all blindly toil over the physical body. Those who truly comprehend the one point of true emptiness are as rare as rabbit horns. The moment you sense movement in the physical body, you rush outward. The moment you feel a melting softness or bliss, you rush outward. In short, whenever you perceive any sensation or phenomenon in the physical body, you immediately go outward to rely on it. The goal is to reach a state where you are unaware of softness or its absence, unaware of heaven and earth or inside and outside, unaware even of having a body—plunging into the boundless stillness of primal chaos. That is the way.\n\nThe physical body is a Zhu Bajie, a thief. Those who study the Dao must be willing to let go, to cast it aside, and not mistake the thief for one’s own child.\n\nHe also said: If you can steadfastly hold to the one point of emptiness at every step, never clinging to the physical body, you will be free of trouble. Once you dispel postnatal illness, I will then transmit to you the oral instructions for the fire-phase transformations. Wherever I am at that time, come to me and follow me for three to five years. Once you secure the foundation of the elixir, you may return home to live as a lofty scholar-recluse. As Zhang Sanfeng said: *\"Once the elixir foundation is laid, return home to till the soil and care for your parents, living as a lofty scholar-recluse for several years before completing the later affairs.\"* This is precisely what I mean.\n\nYou must put in the effort—without it, nothing will come of it. Even if we who study the Dao were emperors, we would not be as carefree. An emperor must attend to every matter, exhausting both mind and strength. By day, he has no leisure; by night, he finds no rest. We, however, spend our days discussing the Dao and practicing cultivation, preserving abundant essence, full qi, a tranquil spirit, and a vacant will. We are untroubled by right or wrong, free to come and go—this is no small blessing.\n\nThe Great Dao is utterly impartial and selfless. You, too, must not be selfish, thinking only of your own longevity. Longevity begins with the absence of self. To be without self is to be utterly empty and still, hollow and vast, unaware of the physical body. Observe how heaven and earth are selfless—they endure forever. Do not harbor scheming thoughts or seek to prevail. Strive to forget things and forget form, so that heart and breath naturally interdepend, and stillness arises naturally. This is the wondrous cultivation of primal chaos.\n\nAncestor Sanfeng said:\n*\"In seeking the mysterious Great Dao,\nI wandered to the ends of the earth.\nI cast aside fame and wealth,\nAbandoned home, fields, and gardens.\nThrough countless hardships,\nClothes tattered, shoes worn,\nFinding a teacher was difficult.\nAlas, sixty or seventy years of life are so brief!\"*\n\nConsider how the ancients endured such hardship and toil before encountering a true teacher and hearing the Great Dao. Since ancient times, those who attained the Dao all emerged from struggle and suffering. Look at Ancestor Qiu, tempering body and mind in Pan Brook—how much hardship he endured! Without perseverance, one can never hope to attain the Dao by luck.\n\nPreventing leakage is simple—just set aside the alchemical classics, commit wholeheartedly to practice, and rely on it at every moment. When external yang stirs, whether during practice or in ordinary thoughtless moments, do not let the mind move. Immediately turn to the external technique, and the external yang will naturally subside. With prolonged practice, this becomes second nature: yang qi will only rise and never descend, and leakage will cease.\n\nWhen the work becomes pure and natural, entering the state of dim indistinctness at any time in the day is excellent. In the twelve hours of daily practice, whenever yang arises, it is all primordial and can be gathered. The moment you become aware, the heart and breath naturally settle externally. After several dozen breaths, you enter the realm of dim indistinctness again. If yang stirs once more, the moment you realize it, the mind remains unmoved, and you naturally rely on the external once again. Do not wait for dozens of breaths—just one or two, and the yang organ will instantly subside. Then, relying again, your breathing ceases, and you enter profound stillness, unaware and unknowing, in a state of primal chaos, without self or others, forgetting things and form—like a living corpse.\n\nPractice this every day, and within a month, all manner of effects will manifest. How swift! As the *Triple Concordance* says: *\"Raise a pole and see its shadow; call into a valley and hear its echo.\"* Not a word is amiss.\n\nYet there is one most crucial phrase—you must practice it to attain such effects. Without cultivation, even after ten thousand years you will remain unchanged; empty talk is of no use. Thus Bai Yuchan said: *\"You must eat the Yunmen cake yourself; do not merely drool while speaking of pilaf.\"* Gazing at me in silence for a long while, he moved me deeply.\n\nWhen yang first stirs, it is always the postnatal within the prenatal. The reason is this: after yang arises, your mind cannot but stir, even to the point of arousing desire for pleasure. Or at this moment, you may suddenly panic, flustered and at a loss. The master said: No matter what, the moment the mind stirs, it is no longer the prenatal within the prenatal. Therefore, when yang first stirs, the key is to detach swiftly from the physical form and hasten to the external. He also said: If you keep your thought unturned, swiftly depart from the physical form, and rely on the external with heart and breath united, you will be safe.\n\nWhether yang subsides or not, do not concern yourself with it; not the slightest attachment to phenomena of the physical form is permissible. A grave mistake is to rely on several breaths and then think, *Let me see if yang has fully subsided.* If you look, fine—yang will rise again. This single act causes great harm, instantly transforming all prenatal essence into postnatal turbidity, the original spirit into the discriminating mind, giving rise to a flood of杂念, disturbing the sovereign heart, turning original qi into turbid qi, original essence into yin essence, leading to tears, nasal discharge, and seminal leakage—all arising from this moment’s transformation. Such practice of the Dao is most perilous. For those whose skill is not yet profound, the consequences are less severe.\n\nShould the practice deepen, the harm becomes incurable. For at the initial barrier of refining essence into qi, there is but a single yang pathway; even if leakage occurs once or twice, life remains unthreatened. Yet when one reaches the middle barrier of refining qi into spirit, the eighty-four thousand pores across the body all become routes for yang to escape. At this stage, should one cling to the physical form, peril is certain.\n\nThus the *Yinfu Jing* states: *\"The noble man who attains it preserves his person; the petty man who attains it squanders his life.\"* You must understand that where there is benefit, there is also harm—this holds true for the practice of the Dao as well.\n\nMeng of Tianjin had cultivated his skill well, yet he constantly sought to test it, measuring how long the external yang would rise or how long it would subside. What use is there in such postnatal verification? The *Wuzhen Pian* says: *\"In the dim and indistinct, they meet; in the profound and obscure, transformations occur. In a flash, the flame soars—then the true person appears of itself.\"* Zhang Sanfeng declared: *\"Seek the true seed where lightning flashes; find the root source when the wind’s signal arrives.\"* See how swift and subtle it is. If one deliberately tests it, this is no longer the meaning of *\"meeting in the dim and indistinct, transformations in the profound and obscure\"*—it is the discriminating mind at work.\n\nThat was why, when I received his letter last year, I knew at once that illness would follow. I immediately instructed Zhen Qing to send a swift warning. Yet before the letter could even be dispatched, word arrived from Tianjin of a grave affliction. You see, he himself remained unaware, while I in Shanghai had already foreseen it and consulted with Zhen Qing to send word. Such an approach is bound to invite trouble—none can escape it. Thus the alchemical texts warn: *\"Guard against danger, contemplate risk.\"*\n\nDo you not cling to the foul skin-bag, nor seek to test it—what danger could there be? Thus, what we guard against and contemplate is the inability to relinquish the body, the failure to forget form.\n\nThe master laughed and said: \"Old Meng has suffered greatly this time—now he truly believes me. Being a teacher is no easy task; if one has not traversed the path oneself, how can one transmit the Dao?\"\n\nI asked: \"What, then, is the *prior-to-prior Heaven*?\"\n\nThe master replied: \"When you reach the arising of yang, practice it day after day until it becomes thoroughly familiar—then it will arise naturally. Once it is natural, you need not manage it. Abiding in utter emptiness and profound stillness, if yang arises, your mind remains unmoved, as if unaware. Yet when heart and breath align, they naturally settle into external steadiness. This is what the *Four-Hundred-Character Inscription* means by *'lead and mercury return to true earth; body and mind are still and unmoving.'* To reach this state of stillness and non-movement is to attain the *prior-to-prior Heaven.*\n\nYang arises naturally—it arises from me, yet what concern is it of mine? You speak of the arising of yang in terms of the physical body; I speak of it in terms of the true self, the Dharma-body. It is no affair of mine. Even if yang arises a hundred times, I remain steadfast, as unshaken as Mount Tai, without the slightest stirring of thought. This is the refinement of the self brought to perfection, the foundation made firm. Is this not the work of relentless effort? Unless you temper heart and breath to the point of death, you will never reach this stage.\n\nOnly then is it true, unalloyed prior Heaven—true relinquishing of the body, true forgetting of form, truly a living corpse. The work now has roots. To gather the prior Heaven is to enter the great samādhi of the dim and indistinct, the profound and obscure—hunhun-dun-dun, knowing nothing, perceiving nothing. When first engaging the arising of yang, the key lies in attaining pure familiarity and naturalness, so that no leakage occurs. This is what is meant by *'once the yang pass is sealed, each attains longevity.'*\n\nFirst, from no arising of yang, you cultivate until yang arises. Then, from the arising of yang, you cultivate until there is no arising of yang. When external yang ceases all movement, the work of destiny is complete. The same applies to women’s cultivation.\n\nIn postnatal husband-and-wife union, there are two realms and four yin and yang—yet even this must reach the state of the dim and obscure. However, proceeding in sequence can only form an ordinary embryo. The path of Dao differs from worldly ways. Those who are sharp-witted may thrive in worldly affairs, but such clarity is ill-suited to the cultivation of Dao. The Dao values confusion—unaware, unknowing, hunhun-dun-dun.\n\nThe master added: \"The more confused you are, the faster the results appear. The stirring of yang in the depths of midnight stillness arises from within the body—this is postnatal. Entering the dim and obscure, sensing the true yang from beyond heaven and earth, and thus manifesting the arising of yang—this is prior Heaven. Yet it remains prior Heaven within the postnatal, not the *prior-to-prior Heaven.* The instant it strays outward is the moment of error.\n\nThe root of emotion is not easily severed; the threads of feeling are not easily purified. One must employ the primordial qi to gradually wash them away—this is no work of a single day or night. Only through unrelenting effort over time will results appear.\n\nLong ago, Qiu Changchun tempered himself for six years at Pan Stream. His heart became like a crystal pagoda, radiant within and without. Yet when a single deluded thought arose, the pagoda collapsed, and he wept bitterly. He resumed his tempering and ultimately succeeded in attaining the Dao.\n\nRefining the self is a process of layer upon layer of sifting away worldly emotions, until one becomes as clear as water, without the slightest dregs. Facing circumstances without emotion, unmoving in suchness—this is excellence. If there is movement, it will not suffice.\n\nBai Ziqing said: *'Forgetting form to nurture qi is the golden elixir; facing circumstances without mind is the great return.'* Cao Wenyu said: *'The mindless mind is the Dao-mind; forgetting both movement and stillness is liberation from desire.'*\n\nThe master said: \"After all, the character *forget* is most essential. In refining qi, forget form; in refining nature, forget emotion.\" Thus, the Buddhists say: *'In the present, one is mortal; when emotion is forgotten, one is Buddha.'*\n\nIf a cultivator of Dao does not know where the primordial qi resides, how can they summon and gather it? If they do not know where to direct their summoning, how can they obtain the inner elixir? To seek it within the physical body is like drilling for blood in a bronze statue. This shell of flesh—the Buddhists compare it to a poisonous tree, liken it to a snake’s den.\n\nOnce you enter the gate of Dao, you must leave this snake’s den. Come outside to settle the spirit and regulate the breath, and rebuild your household—only then is it well.\n\nHerbs and plants can only attack illnesses and regulate qi and blood; they are not the means to nurture life. The *Yellow Court Classic* says: *'Feeding solely on the harmonious qi of yin and yang, one does not die—heaven’s appearance is thus.'* It also says: *'Why not consume the harmonious, pure qi? Thus one does not die and enters the Yellow Tranquility.'* Only by ingesting the great harmonious qi can one attain longevity.\n\nSpirit and qi depend on each other. When qi dissipates, so does spirit; when both are exhausted, death follows. When qi is robust, spirit is robust; when qi gathers, spirit gathers—thus forming the inner elixir, prolonging life in the world. This is a matter of utmost certainty.\n\nThe ancients spoke of *'delusion exhausted, returning to the source.'* In truth, delusion is empty—if it ceases, it is like removing firewood from beneath a cauldron: the boiling water gradually returns to stillness. This is the metaphor of *'delusion exhausted, returning to the source.'* The key is to cease, then apply the work of stillness and forgetting—what is not real in this?\n\nIn general, when first engaging in the work, I simply abide in a state of hunhun-dun-dun, never invoking discriminating thought. Over time, the mind-ground becomes naturally pure, the spirit naturally efficacious, and wisdom naturally awakens.\"\n\nIf one employs a discriminating mind to seek the true, even if attained, it remains delusion. The Confucian texts say: *\"If others can do it once, I will do it a hundred times; if others can do it ten times, I will do it a thousand times. Truly mastering this Way, even the foolish will become enlightened, even the weak will become strong.\"* The Master says: This is what Laozi meant by *\"persisting with determination.\"* It means that if others succeed in a day, I will strive for a hundred days; if others succeed in ten days, I will strive for a thousand.\n\nXue Zixian transmitted the Dao to Chen Cuixu, instructing: *\"Mercury is not lead—lead and mercury are originally sought within the body. Only still the body and mind, unmoving.\"* Bai the Perfected One, having received the method from Chen Cuixu, wrote in verse: *\"Lead and mercury are not taken from within the body; dragon and tiger are sought beyond the mind.\"* At first glance, their words seem contradictory—one says *\"originally sought within the body,\"* while the other says *\"not taken from within the body.\"*\n\nWhen examined closely, however, their teachings remain consistent, without the slightest divergence. The essence of Patriarch Xue’s words lies in the final phrase: *\"still the body and mind, unmoving.\"* When one reaches this state of stillness and immobility, both within and without the body, all is of the primordial. As Zhang Ziqiong said: *\"Heaven and man share the same qi from the beginning, yet the physical form obstructs their union. Only when refinement merges form and spirit do we realize that form is none other than true emptiness.\"* Those who speak but cannot practice are too clever; we who practice but cannot speak are too dull. Therefore, set aside the alchemical texts, commit wholeheartedly to the work—this is most urgent, most urgent.\n\nMaster Meng cultivated with utmost sincerity, devoting a fixed number of hours each day, believing more was always better. Alas! This is still clinging to form. (Here, the speaker smiled.)\n\nBaopuzi observed: *\"Of two who study the Dao, one is ignorant and knows nothing, the other is learned in all things—yet the ignorant one succeeds while the learned one fails.\"* This is a profound truth. We merely borrow heaven and earth as a dwelling, while the power over life and death rests entirely with the Void. If a cultivator can befriend the Void, they transcend heaven and earth, no longer bound by creation’s cycles. One might even say, *\"Heaven and earth are my descendants.\"* Thus, Master Shao declared: *\"Heaven and earth proceed from me—what else is there to say?\"* And Zhang Ziyang said: *\"Only then do I know my fate is not ruled by heaven.\"*\n\nThe Master added: Such words may only be shared with those of understanding; otherwise, they will think me mad. One must first perfect their practice before studying alchemical texts. Above all, the mind must be unburdened, free from all obstruction—otherwise, one will surely come to harm. Not that the texts themselves are to blame; it is simply better not to read them at all.\n\n*The Guidelines for Centering the Mind* is an excellent text—concise yet complete. Its explanation of the interlocking circle is particularly fine, describing how the mind and breath interdepend within the Void. When the entire body—from the soles of the feet (Yongquan) to the crown of the head—becomes supple, tingling, and utterly relaxed, this is the *Zhoutian* (Celestial Circuit). The Greater and Lesser Celestial Circuits originate from the greater and lesser heavens and earth. If one can fall asleep during practice, this is a sign of efficacy. Once this state of suppleness is achieved, maintaining it consistently is ideal.\n\nMind and breath interdepend first through deliberate effort, then naturally—this is the path to certain attainment. The Dao of elixir cultivation proceeds step by step. When the human mind departs, the Heavenly Mind appears; when the consciousness of discrimination recedes, the primordial spirit emerges; when the physical body is relinquished, the Dharma-body is attained. This transformation occurs with swift immediacy.\n\nListen to the breath with the ears, but do not cling to it. Let it flow naturally—do not force it. If distracting thoughts arise, return to listening, then release again. Take the Void as the essence and harmony as the function. When mind, breath, and Void merge as one, essence and function unite, and the *Cantong Qi* (The Kinship of the Three) is realized.\n\nThis treasure of the Void is ever before us, yet none pay it heed. Master Wu observed that while all alchemical texts describe the interdependence of mind and breath, *Journey to the West* illustrates it best with the image of the Golden Cudgel stored in the ear—this is precisely listening to the breath. Such methods are but expedient means for entry; the true work lies in extending one’s spirit and qi outward to harmonize with it.\n\nRegard the indistinct and profound as the master, stillness as the master, oblivion as the master, the forgetting of self and others as the master. Thus Laozi said: *\"Return to the uncarved block,\"* *\"Return to the limitless,\"* *\"Return to the state of infancy,\"* *\"I alone am dull,\"* *\"I alone am muddled,\"* *\"Tranquil, as if without sign.\"* In sum, one becomes a living corpse.\n\nSet aside the alchemical texts and practice—whether for a moment or an hour, each yields its own benefit. More is good; less is also good. Fix the gaze on a single word, neither grasping nor abandoning it. Sleeping is fine; not sleeping is also fine. Alternatively, take a prayer bead, roll it between the fingers, and focus the eyes upon it—this too is an expedient for directing the spirit outward. Where the spirit goes, qi follows. After a time, as the spirit and qi settle externally, mind and breath naturally interdepend.\n\nConsider this: If I wished to strike your arm, my eyes would fix upon it, and the blow would land precisely where my gaze rests—nowhere else. This illustrates the principle. Cai Fuyang likewise said: *\"When I lift a chair, the intention is the spirit; the lifting is the qi.\"* The Master affirmed this.\n\nWhen mind and breath interdepend, this is the primordial; without practice, it is the postnatal. From mind-breath interdependence to the indistinct and profound, the indistinct and profound becomes the primordial, while mind-breath interdependence becomes the postnatal. From the indistinct and profound to utter stillness—no coming, no going, no self, no other, no knowing, no awareness, forgetting things and cares, merged in chaos—this great stillness is the primordial, while the indistinct and profound becomes the postnatal. Each stage ascends further.\n\nThus, one first returns from the postnatal to the primordial, then from the primordial to the primordial’s primordial, and from there to the limitless—without beginning, without end. The work is then complete.\n\nThe Master entrusted me with key instructions for Brother Meng:\n\nFirst, cease practice.\nSecond, study *The Profound Essentials of the Golden Elixir* thoroughly and discard all other alchemical texts.\nThird, I am to explain in detail a passage from the *Profound Essentials* I transcribed for him, emphasizing that he must not resume practice for two or three years. Any attempt to practice now would only reinforce attachment, which is itself the malady.\n\nI must also warn Brother Meng that attachment is profoundly harmful. If not eradicated now, while the illness is still shallow, it may cripple his progress entirely. He must cease practice for two or three years, empty his heart, and reach the state of forgetting things and form before attempting again.\n\nZhen Qingshan has also asked me to inquire of Brother Meng and relay his questions:\n1. Since beginning practice, has his health improved, or has it declined compared to before?\n2. His inability to forget the body and form, his persistent attachment, may stem from prolonged ingestion of medicinal decoctions, which have damaged his body. During practice, when extreme emptiness and profound stillness are reached, latent injuries may react, causing discomfort, pain, or various phenomena that prevent forgetting form and force attachment to the body. He asks if this has been Brother Meng’s experience and requests a detailed reply.\n3. If any uncertainties arise in the future, he may write freely to inquire, so as to ease his mind and prevent hesitation.\n\nThe Master’s final admonition: attachment is the greatest obstacle—it must be uprooted now, or it will forever hinder his progress.\n\nThe return to the youthful state takes only six or seven days. The fastest is five days—this is considered superior and indicates that one’s practice has been exceptionally well executed. Next may be six or seven days. If by the seventh day one has not returned to the youthful state, the practice has faltered, and one can only achieve *shijie* (corpse liberation) rather than ascension. It is further said: these six or seven days are the critical threshold for transcending the mundane and entering sagehood. If one fails to pass this point, there is no hope of achieving the transformation of the spiritual embryo—only *shijie* remains.\n\nMaster Wu states that to ascend, one must reverse the body within seven days. He expounds on the four lines from the *Four-Hundred-Character Inscription*: *\"True Earth seizes True Lead.\"*\n\nThe Master says: *True Earth*—externally, this is the void; within me, it is true intention. *\"True Earth seizes True Lead\"* means that when the breath enters and exits externally, one employs a subtle awareness to perceive it—this is what is called \"using spirit to govern qi.\" *True Lead* is true breath. It is called \"true\" because it is not the postnatal respiration but rather the subtle movement and stillness of the external world. Once one clings to the physical body, one falls into postnatal breathing, and it is no longer true.\n\n*True Earth* is true intention. It is called \"true\" because it is the breath of no-breath—existing yet not existing, neither attached nor detached, the wondrous intention of neither forgetting nor forcing. If one grasps too tightly, one falls into the postnatal human mind, and it is no longer true. *\"Seizes\"* means to govern, to rely upon. Through this method of regulation, one enables the breath to be continuous and dense, leisurely and fine, mutually inhaling and exhaling, mutually cherishing and loving, intertwining into a single mass, forming an unbroken whole. Then, *True Lead* naturally restrains *True Mercury*.\n\n*True Mercury* is one’s original spirit. *True Mercury* and *True Earth* are originally indistinguishable: before intention arises, it is *True Mercury*; once intention arises, it is *True Earth*. The line above, *\"True Earth seizes True Lead,\"* describes using subtle intention to govern the breath, causing heart and breath to rely upon each other. The line *\"True Lead restrains True Mercury\"* means that after long reliance, the breath will not abandon the spirit, and they intertwine, merging into one.\n\nAs Master Ziyang said:\n*\"Wood’s nature loves metal’s righteousness,\nMetal’s affection clings to wood’s kindness.\nMutually swallowing, mutually devouring, yet mutually intimate—\nOnly then does the man conceive.\"*\n\nThis is precisely the meaning. One must understand that *\"True Lead restrains True Mercury\"* is the ultimate state of naturalness—true emptiness and wondrous existence rely upon each other naturally, even the subtle intention from before is forgotten, and together they enter the realm of nothingness.\n\nThus, *\"Lead and Mercury return to True Earth; body and mind are still and unmoving.\"* Why is it called *\"Lead and Mercury return to True Earth\"*? Because after long reliance, the breath’s entry and exit become increasingly fine and subtle, eventually ceasing altogether. Heart and breath become fixed, returning to the state before birth, merging into the realm of emptiness. As Laozi said: *\"Return to the limitless,\"* *\"Return to infancy,\"* *\"Return to simplicity,\"* *\"Return to the root\"*—all express this meaning. At this point, one’s body and mind remain perpetually still, equal in measure to the void.\n\nIn this state, one forgets things and form, knows nothing, understands nothing, merges into chaos, without heaven or earth, inside or outside, beginning or end—directly entering the realm of great harmony, free from thought or worry, unmoving and unshaken. Hence, it is said: *\"Body and mind are still and unmoving.\"* If, at this moment of extreme emptiness and profound stillness, one’s intention turns toward thought or clings to the physical body, the pristine state of the prior heaven instantly transforms into the turbid matter of the posterior heaven, and it no longer accords with the principle of *\"still and unmoving.\"*\n\nOne must recognize that the three words *\"still and unmoving\"* truly embody the image of the prior-heaven limitless. This is a state one must attain—it cannot be overlooked. See how these four lines have already expounded the entire path of internal alchemy—how direct and straightforward!\n\nThe next four lines, *\"From emptiness, white snow arises,\"* can be summarized in one phrase: the medicine is born and gathered. Let me explain further. *White snow and yellow sprouts* refer to the birth of mercury—within the great stillness, the prior-heaven qi naturally arrives from the void into one’s body; this is the production of the medicine.\n\n*\"The jade crucible is warm\"* describes the external state of heart and breath relying upon each other, harmonious and unified, neither forgetting nor forcing. Then, naturally, purple clouds ascend above the crown—this is *\"White clouds rise to the upper palace; sweet dew sprinkles Mount Sumeru.\"* It is nothing other than the mutual reliance of heart and breath.\n\nThe next four lines, *\"The lotus blooms in the flower pool,\"* again describe the reliance of heart and breath, sustained until extreme emptiness and profound stillness, where yang naturally revives. See how lines like *\"Deep in the night, the moon shines bright; heaven and earth are a single mirror\"* are so exquisite! Without arduous effort, one could never compose such verses. Yet mere literary beauty is useless.\n\nMaster Wuyuan also has two lines: *\"A bright moon illuminates the heart of heaven; at midnight, thunder shakes the divine land,\"* which are identical in meaning. Only when practice reaches its utmost can such words emerge.\n\nThe next four lines, *\"Cinnabar refines yang qi,\"* again describe the reliance of heart and breath. True yin and true yang are released into the void, merging into one, transforming into a pool of water. Body and mind are forgotten, and the entire being feels blissfully soft and supple. As the *Canticle* says: *\"Flowing from head to feet, ultimately ascending again. Coming and going through the boundless void, gently enveloped within\"*—all describe this state.\n\nThe final four lines, *\"Medicine and substance arise in the mysterious aperture,\"* again describe the reliance of heart and breath. The first two lines refer to the arrival of prior-heaven qi, which must swiftly be met with external reliance.\n\nThe yang furnace and the mysterious aperture are but a single void; when their alignment is ingenious, the mystic pearl naturally manifests within the corporeal form. Thus it is said: *\"When dragon and tiger unite, the precious crucible yields the mystic pearl\"*—this is the metaphor for the coalescence of the elixir. The four lines *\"This aperture is no ordinary aperture\"* are most excellent. If one seeks it within the corporeal form, it becomes *\"Kan and Li conjoined as one\"*—not *\"Qian and Kun conjoined as one.\"* That it is called *\"the cavity of spirit and qi\"* means one must release spirit and qi into this cavity to interdepend, for this is the twofold heaven and earth, the fourfold yin and yang, the dual cultivation of nature and life.\n\nThe Master said: In sum, the four characters *\"heart and breath interdepend\"* can penetrate the myriad volumes of alchemical texts. The *Guidelines for Centering* depicts seven stars—this is the celestial revolution. The handle of the Dipper remains unmoving, symbolizing the stillness of one’s heart, settled in the external; the remaining six stars revolve and rotate to form the four peaks, symbolizing the true qi steaming and pervading, threading through the entire body, irrigating and circulating throughout. The *Triple Concordance Canon* says: *\"Trickling like spring rain, flowing like melting ice. From head to feet it flows, ultimately ascending again. Coming and going through the boundless void, gently enveloped within\"*—all describe this.\n\nNow to discuss the three lines: *\"Forget form to nurture qi, forget qi to nurture spirit, forget spirit to nurture the void.\"* The Master said: The word *\"forget\"* is the true key; one should take this as a compass. These three lines are peerlessly sublime. The dual cultivation of nature and life comprises two matters, not one. The previously mentioned twofold heaven and earth and fourfold yin and yang, put plainly, are the cultivation of the dharmakāya alongside the corporeal form. The work is done entirely upon the dharmakāya, while the effects manifest entirely at the corporeal form’s edge. The external is the work of life, which through effort becomes natural; thus, the corporeal form naturally undergoes transformative effects—this is called *\"principle of nature.\"* The principle of nature cannot be managed; it is the spontaneity of non-action. The external is called *\"life\"* because all methods—such as kindling and ceasing the fire, harmonizing and compounding the medicine—are enacted externally, constituting the spontaneity of action. Thus it is said: the dual cultivation of nature and life. For in cultivating the external work of life, the principle of nature is already concurrently cultivated. Moreover, the twofold heaven and earth and fourfold yin and yang are precisely the purport of the dual cultivation of nature and life. The external is the dharmakāya, the position of the void, the prior-heaven, Qian and Kun. The internal is the corporeal form, already broken in substance, thus the posterior-heaven, Kan and Li. When one’s spirit and qi are released into the external void, Kan, Li, Qian, and Kun unite as one, and transformation naturally occurs. I say that when one’s spirit and qi are released into the external void to unite, all action takes place externally, while effects manifest entirely upon the corporeal form—only then is it called the dual cultivation of nature and life. Initially, the Master spoke of two matters, not one, which I did not yet comprehend; now I have suddenly understood.\n\nThe two words *\"let go\"* are most crucial. Letting go of the human mind is the Dao-mind; letting go of the corporeal form is attaining the dharmakāya; letting go of the acquired spirit is revealing the original spirit. If you can let go, the effects will be swift. Dispel one part of distracting thoughts, and you gain one part of the treasure; dispel ten parts of distracting thoughts, and you gain ten parts of the treasure. In practice, one must reach the arising of yang to see some effects. Thereafter, the more one practices, the more refined and natural it becomes. When yang arises, you go externally to interdepend—eventually, without your mind’s vexation, the moment it arises, you become aware, and heart and breath naturally settle externally, perfectly aligned, which is the proper method. True intention resides between intention and non-intention.\n\nMaster Yuzi said: *\"When external yang stirs, it is the living midnight.\"* This saying truly misleads people, for it is ten thousand miles from the great prior-heaven Dao. Later practitioners, unaware, follow this method: when external yang stirs, they hastily employ intention to gather it, and illness is unavoidable. One must instead interdepend heart and breath externally, interdepending until one reaches the state of indistinct obscurity, primordial chaos, and great serenity. Within this serenity, if yang stirs, swiftly move to the external—thus is it attained. It is not said that indistinct obscurity is the living midnight, but rather that external yang alone stirs—those who have not even dreamed of the Dao. The stirring of yang in stillness is merely the posterior-heaven corporeal form’s physiological cycle, not the Dao. Yang stirring within indistinct obscurity is the posterior-heaven’s prior-heaven—useless. One must reach the state where internal and external are both utterly void and still, entering great serenity, wherein a single yang stirs. Within serenity, one suddenly feels the entire body suffused with a tingling numbness, like dew or lightning. When true yang arrives, your heart does not move; naturally, it interdepends externally. After three to five breaths, serenity returns as before—only then is it the prior-heaven’s prior-heaven.\n\nThe greatest difficulty is that words cannot touch the body, yet in practice, one cannot avoid being touched—it is all bodily. You must first cultivate a stillness practice, able to settle spirit externally, and then you need not fear this. To be touched by the body is inadmissible, and to be touched by all prior-heaven phenomena is also inadmissible; the ultimate is to be untouched. The great Dao is impartial: some may study a lifetime and not attain it, while others may achieve the Dao in two or three years. Take Zhang Zhennu—she was a courtesan who met Lüzu and attained liberation in two years. Or Li Maiyu, illiterate, who attained the Dao in two or three years.\n\nBright clarity is of no use. Otherwise, the illiterate would be greatly disadvantaged. The master sighed and said: \"What matters is the ability to be muddled—this is the key. Those who do not read alchemical texts progress fastest in their practice. Formerly, I cultivated alongside Huaijing and Yuanbo—Yuanbo was the one who did not read, and of the three, his progress was swiftest. From this, we know that the muddled necessarily live long, while the astute necessarily die young. The muddled let things pass as they are, content with three hundred and sixty days free of cares; their spirit remains whole, and so they attain longevity. The astute are not so: they lose in the east and compensate in the west, falter in the past and triumph in the future, measuring and weighing, attending to this and fretting over that—every detail scrutinized, their spirit wearied and essence depleted, their minds burdened with cares, and thus they die young. Only by shedding this foul carcass does verification come like splitting bamboo, success following step by step without danger.\n\nThe Dark Emperor ascended from the Cliff of Abandoning the Body on Mount Wudang, demonstrating the essential act of relinquishment. It is not only during practice that one must abandon the physical form—through all twelve hours of the day, one must relinquish it. To abandon it only during practice is already too late. Cultivate this habit until, in all twelve hours, you can shed the physical form at every moment: I settle my own nature, letting things be as they are, never encumbered by the body. Only then, in practice, will there be no attachment to form.\n\nThe reason you cannot abandon the body during practice is that you cannot abandon it in ordinary times. You must always keep mind and breath interdependent externally, forgetting form at every moment. When this becomes natural, there is no self, no other, not a speck of dust—then practice comes easily. Thus, Bai Yuchan said:\n*A word or half a phrase reveals the mystery—\nWhat need for alchemical texts by the thousands?\nIf one is not burdened by form,\nThe Great Heaven of the Dao lies before the eyes.*\n\nThis verse is excellent, unmatched in its directness. All in the Dao arises from four yin and two yang, two heavens and two earths, forming the human—a thing of four great illusory aggregates. The immortal Dao likewise arises from four yin and two yang, two heavens and two earths, forming the sage—a thing of four great true aggregates. I have elucidated this in *The Profound Essentials of the Golden Elixir*; reflect upon it.\n\nAfter this book was printed, I revised the draft several times, adding over a hundred entries, then had it carved into blocks for transmission to the world.\"\n\nWhen Yuanbo completed the Minor Celestial Cycle within his body and reverted to the state of a youthful frame, he then devoted another six months of practice, aiming to stabilize it at a fixed duration of four hours. Yet Yuanbo settled at two and a half hours and began the process, encountering considerable danger. For Master Wu, before departing, had repeatedly instructed: \"If you stabilize it at four hours, you will surely come to no harm.\" After Yuanbo had turned his body around, I asked him: \"Master Wu clearly said to stabilize it at four hours—why did you not follow his advice and rush ahead so hastily?\" He replied: \"At two and a half hours, I did not dare to take risks or seek speed; it was simply that the bliss was unbearable, so I could not but proceed.\"\n\nMaster Wu said: \"Through Yuanbo’s practice, we have gained countless insights. I say that the five viscera and six bowels do not truly exist, yet no one believes me. Such profound teachings—when beginners hear them, they immediately reject them. Alas, this stinking bag of skin is but an illusory arising, destined for illusory dissolution. The five viscera and six bowels are merely a sack of illusory, filthy pus within this stinking bag. When I say they do not exist, I speak from the perspective of the primordial True Emptiness. Yet people cling to the notion that they possess them, no wonder they remain attached to the physical form until death without awakening. How difficult it is to cultivate the Dharma-body!\n\nAfter attaining the Dao, one must still transform the physical body into qi—only then are both form and spirit wondrous, merging with the true Dao. If one merely releases a spirit, though it may perform a thousand transformations, it remains spiritually wondrous yet physically unrefined.\"\n\nI asked: \"How can a tangible physical body be transformed into the intangible?\" The Master replied: \"You were originally nothing—how then did you come to possess a body of five or six feet? I implored the Master to further elucidate the principle. He said: \"From nothing comes something—this is 'descending from the root and flowing to the branches to generate the myriad things.' From something returns nothing—this is returning to the root and reverting to the origin to become a true immortal. If one can proceed in sequence, how can one not reverse the course? These subtleties are understood by those who have completed the Celestial Cycle within their bodies.\n\nFor example, qi condenses into dew, and dew condenses into pearls. If one takes a block of solid ice and melts it with fire, it instantly becomes water and then vapor—thus can the tangible return to the intangible. The practice must reach a state of natural mastery. These four characters—*ziran shuqiao* (natural mastery)—have no oral formula; even if explained, they cannot be spoken aloud.\"\n\nObserve a village woman weaving cloth: once seated at the loom, her head, eyes, hands, and feet all move in perfect order, yet she can still converse with others, listening with her ears and speaking with her mouth. Consider how she achieves this—it defies explanation. It is simply that her skill has become so refined that mastery arises naturally. Another example: a craftsman building a chimney a hundred feet high, suspended on all sides in midair, yet he feels no fear, working with his hands while speaking, at ease as if nothing were amiss. Ask him how he does it, and he cannot say. The reason is the same: it is all a matter of naturalness.\n\nThe union of mind and breath is no different. At this moment, you are like beginners learning to weave—once seated at the loom, you attend to your feet only to disorder your hands, or focus on your eyes only to neglect your feet. There is no other reason: you have not yet attained pure natural mastery. If you can devote yourself utterly to the work, there will come a day of effortless proficiency.\n\nNow, let us examine the character *fo* (Buddha). It does not mean clinging to the physical body as the true self; it teaches the abandonment of the self, the relinquishing of life, the absence of self and form, the forgetting of the body. As for the character *xian* (immortal), the Master says: *Ren* (人, person) refers to the human mind, while *shan* (山, mountain) symbolizes immobility. Only when the union of mind and breath reaches its utmost stillness does the human mind become as unshaken as a mountain, without going or coming—this is what it means to be an immortal. Master Yuchan said, *\"Facing the world without a mind is the great return,\"* pointing to this very principle. Both *xian* and *fo* share the radical *ren* (人), showing that immortals and Buddhas are cultivated from humanity. The creation of characters is no trivial matter—observe *ming* (明, brightness), *yi* (易, change), *miao* (妙, subtlety), *gui* (圭, jade tablet), and *dao* (道, Way): each contains profound principles.\n\nTrue mastery requires reaching the point of seeming madness. Thus, among the immortals of old, there were those like Wang Chongyang, who feigned madness and was called \"Wang the Mad.\" The Master says: You must reach the state where you can roll on the ground, then rise and eat as if nothing happened, spending your days in unknowing simplicity, drifting in primordial chaos—only then have you arrived. When idle, emulate a fool, practicing stillness, projecting your spirit beyond the body, untouched by its form—this brings benefit. Those who cultivate the Dao must know contentment, free from improper desires, and remain single-minded, without thoughts of luck or chance.\n\nThe Great Harmony’s eternal *qi* abides, yet the obstacle lies in our inability to sense and draw it in. Li Daochun said, *\"The two words 'body' and 'mind' are both medicine and fire.\"* Body and mind are none other than spirit and *qi*. Shi Xinglin also said, *\"Know the medicine and fire, and within stillness you will witness the elixir’s completion.\"* The character *ding* (定, stillness) is most crucial. Xue Daoguang said, *\"In still breath, seek true lead.\"* This is the oral formula. *Dingxi* (定息, still breath) means the calming of inhalation and exhalation. The ancient immortals said, *\"Without stillness, yang does not arise.\"* When stillness deepens to the point where body and mind are utterly motionless, equal to the vastness of empty space, the path beyond the mundane opens.\n\nWhen a person dies, it is the end, yet grasses and trees wither in winter only to sprout anew in spring. This is because they return to their root, while humans cannot. In truth, humans are not even equal to grasses and trees. Thus, Zhang Sanfeng said, *\"Learn the grasses’ and trees’ method of gathering at the head, returning to life by reverting to the root.\"* When spirit and *qi* are gathered into the Mysterious Pass, this is returning to the root. Laozi said, *\"The gate of the Mysterious Female is called the root of heaven and earth.\"* This Mysterious Pass is not only the root of heaven and earth but also the root of our very existence. When spirit and *qi* return to their root, this is the Way of deep roots and firm stems.\n\nShi Jianwu said, *\"The wondrous existence of the single spirit pervades the Dharma realm. Departing from all extremes, it firmly holds to the center.\"* These four lines describe the union of mind and breath. *Yiling* (一灵, single spirit) is spirit; *miaoyou* (妙有, wondrous existence) is *qi*; *li zhongzhong bian* (离种种边, departing from all extremes) points to the external emptiness; *zhong* (中, center) is the Mysterious Pass; *yunzhi* (允执, firmly holding) means spirit and breath embracing each other, continuously abiding. Is this not the union of mind and breath?\n\nIn *Fanghu Waishi*, one need only read the *Dao De Jing* and *Xuanlan*—the rest may be set aside, for they deal with forms. Were it not for my practice, I would have died many times over. Do not assume, because you are young, that death will not come for you—human affairs are unpredictable.\n\nTwo months ago, I contracted malarial dysentery, and my feet swelled as well. After three days of practice, I fully recovered. This swelling ailment is now rampant in Shanghai, and many have died from it. One of my disciples also fell gravely ill with it—who knows if he has passed today or not.\n\nSpeaking of Master Sanfeng: *\"Knowing my inner elixir is complete, / I need not speak of laying the foundation. / Bestow upon me the outer elixir’s work— / How earnest and urgent the exhortation!\"* The Master said: The inner elixir is the refinement of *xing* (nature), the work of *xing*, the root of stillness practice. When the heart is empty, the spirit is still, and the intent is settled, the inner elixir is already formed—hence there is no need to speak of laying the foundation. *\"Bestow upon me the outer elixir’s work\"* refers to the external, wondrous technique of gathering, harmonizing, refining, and returning to the furnace. *\"How earnest and urgent the exhortation!\"* speaks of the oral transmission, the subtle transformations of external fire-timing. Earnestly admonished, meticulously instructed—hence *\"earnest and urgent.\"*\n\nNext, it says: *\"Refine the self, forgetting worldly cares; / Gather the medicine, following the seasons.\"* See how every line in his writings is substantial, how excellent! Refining the self requires forgetting worldly cares—the word *\"forget\"* is crucial. One must diminish worldly thoughts again and again, until reaching non-action. The *Qingjing Jing* states: *\"Inwardly observe the heart—there is no heart. Outwardly observe the form—there is no form. Distantly observe things—there are no things. When these three are realized, only emptiness is seen. Observe emptiness, and even emptiness is empty. When the emptied is no more, even ‘no-emptiness’ is no more. When ‘no-emptiness’ is no more, there is only profound stillness. When stillness is no longer stillness, how can desire arise? When desire does not arise, this is true stillness. Responding to things with true constancy, one attains true nature. Constant in response, constant in stillness—this is constant purity.\"* Is this not forgetting the self, forgetting things, and even forgetting forgetting?\n\n*\"Gather the medicine, following the seasons\"*—when skill in practice is perfected, it precisely accords with the method. *\"Season\"* refers to the *huo zishi* (living midnight); *\"node\"* refers to the tally. These two words are most essential. When yang first arises, the heart instantly perceives it, yet remains utterly unmoved, the heart already settled externally—this is *\"following the seasons.\"* In sum, the great precelestial Dao lies within the indistinct and obscure. Only by attaining its utmost subtlety and wonder does one reach the precelestial before the precelestial. If the heart gives rise to great clarity and awareness, it falls into the postcelestial—this is not the meaning of *\"meeting in the indistinct, transforming in the obscure.\"* Thus, one must not seek clarity; the key is to remain muddled.\n\nI asked: What is *\"laying the foundation\"*? The Master said: When the heart is empty, the foundation is laid. Refining the self is the external technique—mind and breath embracing each other. Laying the foundation has limits; refining the self is boundless. One must refine the self until rebirth, after which it is no longer needed. From beginning to end, it is all refining the self.\n\nThe writings of the Southern Five Ancestors surpass those of the Northern Seven Perfected. Among the Northern Seven, Ma Danyang’s works are the finest—even surpassing his teacher Wang Chongyang. Among good alchemical texts from the Tang and Song dynasties onward, there are scarcely more than a dozen, all clearly enumerable. The works of Ancestors Zhong and Lü are excellent; Bai Yuchan’s are excellent; Zhang Xuqing the Perfected’s are excellent; Liu Haichan’s are excellent; Ma Danyang’s are excellent; Zhang Sanfeng’s are excellent; the two schools of Lu Qianxu and Li Hanxu are excellent; Zheng Heyang’s are excellent. Beyond these, Zhang Ziyang, Wei Boyang, and Xu Jingyang—there are only a few more.\n\nThe *Xingming Guizhi* states: *\"Before parents’ birth, a single numinous spark— / Unluminous only because form congealed. / When form veils the radiant seed, / Lay it down, and clarity returns in full.\"* The Master said: It is only because worldly people cannot lay things down that they cannot attain thorough clarity.\n\nMaster Yuchan said: *\"A word or half a phrase reveals the profound— / What need for alchemical texts by the thousands? / If one is not burdened by form, / The Great Brahma Heaven lies before one’s eyes.\"* The Master said: It is only because worldly people cannot forget form that they cannot reach the Great Brahma Heaven. Such poetry is truly fine—how direct and swift, leaping straight to the essence! Yet how is it that you all dismiss it as ordinary and overlook it?\n\nSomeone wrote a letter expounding at length—thousands of words—on the history of the *Taiji* circle. The more a disciple pressed for an answer, the more the Master refused to reply. The disciple then cited sayings such as *\"Rotten wood cannot be carved, nor can a wall of dung be plastered,\"* and enclosed three cents in postage, insisting the Master respond. The Master had already drafted a reply and showed it to me. It read, in part: *\"A single sweep of clarity—this is my answer to you.\"* He further wrote: Lü Dongbin said, *\"The true scripture was originally wordless.\"* Heyang Weng said, *\"All written sutras on paper are but dregs.\"* Chen Shangyang’s commentary on the *Awakening to Reality* states: *\"The nine schools and hundred traditions, with their arts for responding to the world, may all be transmitted on paper—only the Golden Elixir cannot be written down.\"* The *Triple Concordance Canon* says: *\"The Three, the Five, and the One are the essence of Heaven and Earth. They may be transmitted orally but cannot be conveyed in writing.\"* It also says: *\"Heaven and Earth are vast and boundless; the Great Mystery has no form. Void and still, it cannot be seen—its vastness dissolves into nothingness.\"* And again: *\"The primordial essence cannot be perceived.\"* Laozi said: *\"It cannot be seen, cannot be heard, cannot be grasped.\"* Since ancient times, those who attained the Dao have all said it cannot be transmitted in writing, yet you insist I write it out for you. Consider: have I wronged you, or have you wronged me? If you seek annotations on the *Taiji* diagram, the *Compendium of Nature and Principle* in the Ming edition contains over a dozen commentaries. But when it comes to returning to the root, they are all like drilling into a bronze man for blood or clinging to clay idols and written words. What use is it to read a thousand such works?\n\nThe Master said: All these discussions of the *Taiji* circle—long or short—are merely copied from the *Comprehensive Mirror*. What use are they? He added: In ancient times, those who sought a master sought one who had attained the Dao. What are you bringing forth on your own? Today’s seekers of the Dao all boast of their own learning—this much or that—but they are still millions of miles from the true path. He also said: I receive many letters daily, and with no one to write replies for me, I only respond after two or three accumulate. Even then, I am forced to oblige. And now he encloses three cents in postage—what do I need it for? It is not as if I refuse to reply for want of three cents.\n\nThe Master sighed: This is how people seek the Dao nowadays. At that moment, I was deeply moved. There are those who have followed the Master for twenty or thirty years and still have not heard a single word from him. In cultivating the Dao, single-minded devotion is essential. People of past and present alike treat it as a game—no wonder the Master is dissatisfied.\n\nI rise at eight, wash my face, and eat congee. By nine, I lie on the rattan couch to work. After about two and a half hours, I rise at eleven-thirty. If letters arrive, I read them; if not, I revise the *Mysterious Essentials of the Golden Elixir*. I take lunch at twelve-thirty, receive visitors from one to four, and after four, lie on the bed to practice. I rise at seven. If I cannot begin at four, I start at four-thirty. I must practice at five—no more politeness with you all. Once you impose control, you fall into the postnatal. The moment you seek results, you fall into the postnatal.\n\nHe also said: In worldly affairs, the danger is lack of clarity; in cultivating the Dao, the danger is lack of confusion. In worldly affairs, the greatest fear is having no master; in cultivating the Dao, the greatest fear is having one. He added: To say it has nothing to do with the physical body is still superficial. To reach the truth, it must have no connection whatsoever with the mind, consciousness, or intent—only then is it the true primordial of the primordial. Such words must be realized through practice; they are profoundly abstruse. Yet how few believe them! Truly, those who understand are rare.\n\nI asked about reclusion. The Master said: It lies in the heart, not in one’s surroundings. As the ancients said, *\"The great Dao is hidden in the marketplace.\"* What need is there to speak of reclusion? If I wish to practice, I can do so here. He said: Outside, there is chaos, but here I am at peace—eating, sleeping, free of cares. Where else would I go? It is not necessarily quieter elsewhere.\n\nI asked when he would return to the childlike state. The Master said: Only after settling family matters and going to Huaijing’s place. One cannot succeed at home, for there are always attachments. When I practice, if my little granddaughter climbs onto the table, I see her and fear she might fall, so I call someone to take her away. Such distractions are endless. Once I leave home, I can practice without concern; let them manage the household—I will not be distracted. As the saying goes: *\"Out of sight, out of mind.\"*\n\nI said: You are now seventy-eight. If family matters cannot be settled at once, and you return to the childlike state at eighty or ninety, will the practice not become even more difficult? The Master said: Not so. It depends on one’s daily practice, not age. The older one is, the deeper the practice, the more the heart dies—returning to the childlike state becomes easier. Many ancients only undertook this work in old age, precisely for this reason.\n\nI asked: When you practice at home, who serves as your dharma protectors?\n\nThe Master said: One is surnamed Zhong, the other Wang. The one surnamed Zhong is from Guangdong, quite tall in stature—he is Zhong Zhicheng. He has followed me for over a decade. In Shanghai, I rely entirely on his assistance. He has practiced with me three times already, and now he is coming again. The Master then drew a letter from the drawer on the table and showed it to me. It was from Zhong Zhicheng, informing the Master that he would arrive in Shanghai after the Double Ninth Festival to seek further instruction. I asked whether the Master had transmitted the complete oral instructions to him. The Master replied: He still lacks the final step, which is why he must come here again to practice.\n\nI then asked about the one surnamed Wang. He sought the Dao all the way to Siam, even more persistently than I did in my early years. He encountered heterodox schools and suffered greatly for it. Later, upon meeting me, he believed in me after just a few words. Knowing he had endured much hardship, I instructed him to practice. He followed me for three months, achieved results, and witnessed great efficacy. This past February, he came to Shanghai again to practice, staying at an inn and visiting me every one or two days. His practice was excellent. He told me his grandfather had devoted his life to the Dao but passed away without encountering a true teacher, leaving behind many Daoist texts in his family. Wang himself had passed the military imperial examination and was assigned to a minor official post in the capital. He said to his father: Our family already has considerable wealth; if nothing unforeseen occurs, even a lifetime of idleness would not exhaust it. I am content and truly have no desire to serve as an official. I often think of my grandfather, who sought the Dao his whole life without success. I, too, am drawn to the Dao, and if I cannot attain it, I secretly wish to carry on his legacy—traveling to the Four Sacred Mountains and major cities across the provinces to seek out accomplished masters. If, by chance, I encounter one, then to perfect myself and others would be a great merit indeed. His father replied: This is a fine endeavor. If you can find the Dao, you will fulfill your grandfather’s aspirations. I will allow you to seek it, and if you succeed, you must tell me. Thus, he traveled throughout China and even to foreign lands like Siam.\n\nThe Master said: Few at my place are willing to exert such relentless effort. The last time you met Cai Fuyang, he also assisted me greatly. In Shanghai, I rely entirely on the two great pillars, Cai and Zhong; without them, I could not have established myself here. How else could I live here with such bold confidence? Cai Fuyang is most eager to help me publish books—he has already contributed five or six hundred yuan for this purpose. When the Republic was founded, I moved here from Hankou, and Cai handled everything: finding a house, arranging the move. Without him, my relocation to Shanghai would not have been so smooth, for I was unfamiliar with the place. With Wang and Zhong, if I had one more powerful supporter, I could leave home entirely—I am quite content as it is.\n\nThe Master recited a poem by Shi Xinglin:\n*\"All things are born and die,\nThe primordial spirit dies and revives.\nWhen the spirit returns within the qi,\nThe elixir path naturally forms.\"*\n\nThe Master said: The method of the elixir is not complex—these words encapsulate it entirely. Whether one attains the Dao depends on fate. In this world, those who achieve the Dao meet one another by karmic affinity; otherwise, one might seek for a lifetime and never encounter a single true teacher.\n\nI said: Though this may be so, those who possess the Dao do not reveal their edges. Without innate wisdom, how can one recognize them? Thus, a true teacher is indeed difficult to find. The Master nodded in agreement.\n\nAfter a pause, he continued: Now that you understand the emptiness of external appearances, when you next encounter a teacher, you will have confidence and will no longer be misled by blind masters. You must know that most who attained the Dao in ancient times did not receive transmission from a single teacher. Take Lü Chunyang, for example: he was taught by Shi Hufu, Ma Ziran, and Zhongli Quanyang. At the time, he received only a single oral instruction from each, and even Zhongli did not transmit the full teaching to him.\n\nHe added: Those who fixate solely on cultivating the physical body are all heterodox and external paths. Ke Huaijing is the same age as I—seventy-eight this year. Ke Zaishu is already over eighty, and Sun Yuanbo is over ninety, nearly a hundred. When I first met him, he was already seventy-six or seventy-seven. Eight years later, I met him again, and he was over eighty.\n\nMy disciple surnamed Li is now over sixty years old. When Master Wu came a second time, he had already reverted to the body of a youth.\n\nThe Master said: \"My family affairs are settled, and as I thought your oral instructions were incomplete, I came again to meet you. I took a detour here on my way to Jiujiang in Jiangxi.\"\n\nAt parting, we begged the Master to take us with him into reclusion. Master Wu replied: \"Your family affairs are not yet settled, nor do I wish you to follow me. Each may return to your own place of reclusion.\"\n\nWe asked where the Master would seclude himself, and Master Wu said: \"Whether in town or countryside, anywhere will do, so long as outsiders do not know we cultivate the Dao.\"\n\nThereupon we took our leave.\n\nThe Master added: \"Master Wu is exceedingly stern—he will not tolerate even the slightest pretense of courtesy from you.\"\n\nDuring my stay here these past few days, a young boy of seventeen has arrived, utterly devoted to the Dao. He had copied out the titles of all the Daoist texts I had previously studied and carried the list with him to seek them everywhere. The day before yesterday, he arrived here.\n\nHe said, \"Master, I have purchased a Daoist text—*Fanghu Waishi*—a complete edition.\"\n\nI replied, \"This book cannot be found here. You may have bought a counterfeit—bring it to me so I may examine it.\"\n\nHe brought it for me to see, and it was indeed genuine, though printed from lead plates. Only the *Preface to the Awakening to Reality* was missing; the rest was complete. This must have been printed from a collector’s copy.\n\n\"You may also buy a copy to read,\" I said.\n\nThe Master then retrieved his old copy of *Nanhua Fumo* to show us. Its format was smaller than the edition Meng had purchased, and the printing was far inferior.\n\nI said, \"Meng mentioned that *Nanhua Fumo* is also available in Beijing.\"\n\nThe Master replied, \"I will have you write a letter to Meng, asking him to purchase it for me. Whatever the price, have him send it to me, and I will reimburse him. Many seek this book—I have a disciple who has also asked me to find a copy for him.\n\nRefining the self and laying the foundation are not merely about quietude and sealing essence. If quietude were the Dao, why not speak of refining the heart instead of refining the self? If sealing essence were the Dao, why not speak of refining the kidneys instead of laying the foundation? Refining the self and laying the foundation are two in one, one in two.\n\nFrom the perspective of the primordial, it is simply a matter of heart and breath depending on each other—nothing more. The difficulty lies solely in the first step of refining the self; all subsequent efforts are easy. Only the beginning is hard.\"\n\nHis words were earnest, as if urging us to advance with all haste.\n\nWhen I had previously encountered Master Wu aboard a foreign ship, his spirit was radiant, unlike that of ordinary men. He wore purple-flowered cloth socks, a long blue robe, and over it a sky-blue satin *magua*. To me, he seemed a true antique.\n\nLater, he instructed Ke Huaijing and me to each donate five hundred yuan for famine relief.\n\nI said, \"Master Wu, you once told us not to give you a single coin. Why now ask us each for five hundred?\"\n\nMaster Wu replied, \"This is for famine relief—I will not use a single coin of yours for myself. My family owns money shops, pawnshops, fields, and houses, worth several hundred thousand. I am many times wealthier than you—why would I need your money? If you do not believe me, I will give you this *magua* as a gift.\"\n\nAs he spoke, he could not help but laugh heartily.\n\nI said, \"Master Wu, if I donate five hundred yuan for famine relief and you give me this *magua*, what is the point? I trust your words.\"\n\nMaster Wu said, \"This is no lie.\"\n\nI truly wished to give it to you. I wear purple-flowered cloth socks and a dark-blue robe—this *magua* does not match, and wearing it would only invite ridicule. So I no longer want it and offer it to you as a keepsake.\n\nI said, \"I already have one of my own. Why would I need yours? Please keep it for yourself.\"\n\nMaster Wu was carefree in spirit and magnanimous in heart. Though stern in daily conduct, he would sometimes jest and laugh with us. Over the matter of donating five hundred yuan for famine relief, I unexpectedly gained a sky-blue *magua*—such was the delightful exchange between master and disciple.\n\nOn \"renewing the people\" and \"loving the people\":\nThe Master said, \"Renewing the people pertains to the work of *xing* (nature), while loving the people pertains to the work of *ming* (destiny). This follows the *Yijing*’s ‘Clouds follow the dragon, wind follows the tiger,’ and ‘That which is rooted in Heaven inclines upward, that which is rooted in Earth inclines downward.’ Zhu Xi did not understand and altered it to ‘renewing the people.’ While ‘renewing the people’ is not entirely amiss, Zhu Xi did not grasp what ‘loving’ truly meant. His arbitrary emendation was thus a transgression. How could one renew the people below without first loving those above? Without this foundation, renewal below lacks any basis.\"\n\nHe continued, \"‘Renewing the people’ corresponds to the *Cantong Qi*’s lines: ‘Weed out the old filth, and all things flow smoothly in fine order.’ This is the transformation of the old and establishment of the new—it is the work of *xing*. As for ‘loving the people,’ it is the external harmony of heart and breath, the union of spirit and *qi*. In essence, it is the mutual affinity of like kind. Both the *Cantong Qi* and *Wuzhen Pian* derive from the *Yijing*.\"\n\n\"In learning the Dao, one must ultimately reach the state of ‘no knowledge, no perception.’ At present, when I practice, I can become muddled and unaware, knowing nothing. But when I am not practicing, I cannot maintain this state. If one could remain muddled and unaware even when not practicing, one would return to the state of a child. Yet even this stage is not easily attained—I have toiled painstakingly to reach it.\"\n\n\"Zhu Yuanyu’s *Cantong Qi Chanyou* represents the pinnacle of understanding and is worth studying. The *Bai Zi Bei Zhu* in *Fanghu Waishi* is also excellent, as is the commentary on the *Yinfu Jing*—all are worth reading. To distinguish between the precelestial and postcelestial, the *Xinyin Jing Ceshu* is superb and must be read thoroughly. Study the *Xuanyao*, and you will attain great awakening and realization.\"\n\nHe added, \"You must thoroughly investigate the boundary between the precelestial and postcelestial until your mind is free of doubt. Then, when practicing, you will never become attached to appearances.\"\n\nHe also said, \"When reading, always seek the subtle signs in the void beyond the body. Do not force guesses or blind groping in the postcelestial physical form—this will save you effort. The signs in the void grow ever more profound and intriguing the deeper you explore.\"\n\n\"Read the formless texts day after day, again and again. Over time, you must empty the heart, leaving the mind unbound, free of the slightest attachment, all worries dissolved, not a speck of dust clinging. Abide in emptiness all day, without a single thought arising—only then will you be close. Afterward, when I speak with you of profound matters, you will naturally awaken. What the ancients called ‘instant enlightenment upon a word’ comes from long accumulation. One day, when the master points the way, sudden clarity dawns. This is what it means to practice and awaken simultaneously—progress is swift.\"\n\n\"When I have no other affairs, I only study the *Yijing*. After one reading, I found some evidence to refute Zhu Xi. After another, I discovered more. Thus, my yet-unpublished *Jindan Xuanyao* has grown by over two thousand characters compared to the printed version. Eventually, I must carve a woodblock for it.\"\n\nHe continued, \"To refute Zhu Xi as an outsider, you must cite the *Yijing* as evidence. The *Yijing* is a book authored by the Four Sages. Only with this proof can you overpower Zhu Xi’s convictions; otherwise, your argument will not strike the mark. This is why I study the *Yijing* daily. Without relentless effort, one can never reach the goal. Though attaining the Dao is difficult, it is ultimately achievable by human effort. As Laozi said, ‘A nine-story terrace begins with a mound of earth; a thousand-mile journey starts with a single step; a tree that fills one’s embrace grows from a tiny sprout.’\"\n\n\"Learning the Dao is simply a matter of transformation. Good alchemical texts require few words. Observe the *Ruyao Jing*—in just a few hundred characters, it encompasses the entire beginning and end of the Dao. The opening four lines are the most concise, yet they say it all.\"\n\nI asked, \"Where do immortals reside?\"\nThe Master replied, \"In the single point of numinous *qi* within the void. When still, it is spiritually luminous without bounds; when in motion, its divine power is infinite.\"\n\nI asked, \"When the Earth is destroyed, will the dharmakāya cultivated by immortals also perish?\"\nThe Master said, \"This depends on your practice. If you reach the utmost state of returning to the void and merge with the Dao, you will transcend the creation and transformation of Heaven and Earth, beyond decay and destruction, existing alone and unchanging—how could it perish? If you only practice stillness, you will fall into dead emptiness. Thus, to instantly empty the heart, you must rely on external forms.\"\n\nHe added, \"After all, the work of *xing* is not particularly valuable. The Buddhists have a few lines that express it well: ‘True emptiness does not obstruct wondrous existence; wondrous existence does not obstruct true emptiness,’ and so on.\"\n\n\"During the late Qing, one could not utter a single word against Zhu Xi. If you did, people would condemn you.\"\n\nObserve how Chen Shangyang annotated the *Cantong Qi*—on the surface, he dared not speak ill of it, yet he had to gloss over it with a few obligatory words. Thus it was through the Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties. Only in the Republic, with freedom of speech, could one speak whatever one wished, so long as it accorded with principle. Therefore, I have made clear Zhu Xi’s heterodox path to prevent its boundless harm.\n\nHe further said, \"All who attain the Dao must refute Zhu Xi. Zheng Heyang refuted him most severely. Though I have many disciples, they all merely discourse on the Dao and refuse to apply themselves. Only one man and one woman have cultivated to the point of repelling wind, cold, damp, and moisture; the rest, when faced with grave illness, are helpless.\"\n\nI asked, \"Who are these two?\"\n\nThe Master replied, \"One is Zhong Zhicheng; the other is the daughter of a certain official in Beijing. Years ago, I stayed at her home for over a year, and her practice was truly excellent.\"\n\nBreathing with effort is the martial fire; breathless absorption is the civil fire; within absorption, entering the state of forgetting marks the cessation of fire. *Journey to the West* is far too prolix—even after forty readings, one still fails to grasp the apertures, and enlightenment comes with great difficulty. Thus, it is better to read *The Mysterious Essentials of the Golden Elixir*.\n\nSince antiquity, works that establish a distinct school have been exceedingly rare. Let me attempt to name them: *The Yin Talisman*, the *Dao De Jing*, *The Southern Florescence*, *The Vital Axis*, *The Master Who Embraces Simplicity*, *Journey to the West*, and *The Mirror for Compounding the Medicine*—only these few. Though *The Seal of Unity* is excellent, it ultimately remains a restatement of the *Book of Changes* and does not constitute a distinct school.\n\nMy *Mysterious Essentials* focuses solely on the fluctuations of emptiness, taking no images as its basis. It differs greatly from the works of the various perfected ones since the Tang and Song dynasties, for it opens a new path. My aim, after all, is to establish a distinct school.\n\n*The Pointers on Nature and Life* relies on images and is not worth reading. Ke Huaijing’s *Cultivating Nature* and my own *Essentials of Nature and Life* both employ images and are likewise unworthy of study.\n\nHe further said: When I first began writing, Master Ke told me, \"I have read few alchemical texts and have little substance in my belly, so my writing cannot avoid relying on images. You, elder brother, have read widely and have much substance within. I urge you to compose a work without images.\" I replied, \"A work without images is difficult to write, and my literary skill is not equal to yours.\" Master Ke said, \"This is not a matter of literary skill. Plain speech is fine, so long as it is clear and comprehensible.\"\n\nYour static practice lacks foundation, which is why your progress stagnates. Now, hasten to apply yourself to static practice—like a dullard sitting motionless in a chair, unmoving and unshaken, like a corpse, releasing the spirit outward. If stray thoughts arise, notice and dispel them at once. Strive to maintain a state of no-thought; if you can drift into sleep, all the better.\n\nI asked, \"What if stray thoughts cannot be fully dispelled?\"\n\nThe Master replied sternly, \"Only the utmost sincerity in the world can effect transformation. Without sincerity, there is nothing.\"\n\nI was thus enlightened.\n\nReleasing the spirit outward in static practice is a method used by the ancients in old age, when essence is withered and spirit is dull, to nourish the spirit. For young cultivators of the Dao, this practice is unnecessary, though engaging in it occasionally may still be beneficial.\n\nHe further said: If one persists in this static practice without interruption for many years, one may live to be over a hundred. Thus, the value of the Dao is beyond words.\n\nIn discussing *Journey to the West*, he spoke of the Tang Monk, Wukong, and Bajie traveling together. The Tang Monk instructed Wukong to expound the *Heart Sutra*, but Wukong remained silent. After a long while, Bajie grew restless and said, \"This monkey is always up to mischief, playing tricks. He claims to know the *Heart Sutra*, yet when the master orders him to speak, he says nothing. Clearly, he doesn’t understand and is pretending to be enlightened to deceive the master. Speak at once!\"\n\nWukong still said nothing. The fool then caused a great uproar.\n\nWukong had already spoken.\n\nAs the ancients said, \"The Great Dao transcends words.\" The Buddha-dharma also states: \"The teaching that does not speak is the true teaching. I have already understood.\"\n\nThe Master said: Such passages in *Journey to the West* are truly excellent, yet people fail to pay attention. Thus, the Great Dao of the Golden Elixir cannot be captured by brush or ink, nor even expressed in speech. As Master Yuchan said, \"The wonder of the moment lies in mind-to-mind transmission.\" Confucius also said, \"I wish to speak no more.\" All these point to the same truth.\n\nHe then discussed the episode of Bottomless Cave in Mount Void-Trap. The Master said: This illustrates how those who enter heterodox paths, focusing solely on cultivating their own nature, fall into the abyss of emptiness and cannot escape in a lifetime. Wukong said, \"I have fought thousands upon thousands of battles, yet I have never seen such a cave. Why is it so dark and bottomless?\" He then ordered Bajie to test it first. The pig shook his head and said, \"My body is heavy as a rammer. If I step into such a cave, it would take two or three years just to reach the bottom!\"\n\nThe Master said: Such writing awakens many. Thus, a single misstep into heterodox paths leaves one in eternal darkness, making it difficult to behold the light.\n\nThe three hundred and eighty-four chambers within further correspond to the three hundred and eighty-four lines of the *Yijing*, while the Bottomless Cave may also be interpreted as the Primordial Limitless. Like Mount Kongtong, it admits both precelestial and postcelestial readings—hence the *Journey to the West* is difficult to fathom, for its transformations are inexhaustible and its metamorphoses boundless.\n\nIn youth, one finds it hard to apply effort, for the qi and blood are vigorous, the will and spirit sharp, and all undertakings pursued with fierce intensity. How much of this edge is truly beneficial? Thus, one cannot yet engage in practice. Only when the sharp angles have been worn smooth, when one has leisure to quietly contemplate the *Cantong qi*, the *Daode jing*, and the *Yinfu jing*, and when the heart is at peace and the qi harmonized, does it become easy to begin.\n\nBooks without form, once thoroughly studied, prove useful. Books with form must never be read.\n\nTo turn the flowing and shifting of birth-and-death into the stillness of quiescent extinction is the ladder to transcendence. Even in the present moment, the ebb and flow of breath, the arising and ceasing of thoughts—are these not all manifestations of flux? One must learn to transform them.\n\nMaster Sengcan’s *Xinxin ming* says: “When the One Mind does not arise, the myriad dharmas are without fault.”\nGuan Yinzi says: “When a single breath does not remain, the Dao will come to meet you.”\n\nThe Master said: Whether speaking of mind or breath, the goal is to sever past and future, to rest in quiescence and non-arising. Both the root of nature and the stem of life depend on this.\n\n“Does not remain” means the cessation of ordinary breath, the tranquil entry into samadhi. Within this samadhi, the precelestial original spirit and original qi naturally arrive. Hence it is said, “the Dao will come to meet you.”\n\nWhen body and mind are both stilled, what can the workings of creation do to me?\n\nThe Master cited Lü Zu’s words: “When the inner elixir is complete, the outer elixir forms. Inner and outer join, prolonging life. A purple-golden flower coalesces, soaring beyond heaven and earth.”\n\nThe Master said: When a practitioner’s refinement of the self is pure, the breast free of worldly thoughts, and the contemplation of phenomena without attachment—when one rests in utter stillness—this is the stabilization of nature, the completion of the inner elixir. The reason lies in daily relinquishing a portion of the precelestial to subdue the postcelestial mind’s delusive movements. Over time, delusion is exhausted and returns to the source, abiding in unshakable stillness. The Central Palace becomes empty and serene, like the moon shining in mid-heaven—this is arriving home. Only then can one refine the Nine Returns.\n\nNine is the yang number, the true yang that arises from quiescent emptiness in samadhi. This is called the Golden Flower, or the external medicine. The “external elixir” refers to its coming from without, not being inherently part of the physical body. The *Cantong qi* says: “When metal returns to the initial nature, it may be called the Returned Elixir.” Metal is the precelestial qi, termed wondrous existence. The “initial nature” is the true emptiness of original nature, also termed wondrous existence. Alchemical classics compare it to true lead and true mercury, or to the infant boy and the maiden girl. In essence, it is the union of the qi of wondrous existence with one’s true empty nature. When inner and outer join, emptiness and existence merge, likened to the medicinal spoon, named the Returned Elixir, the Purple-Golden Pill—another name for the Returned Elixir.\n\nNames and metaphors abound, but in awakening, all is simple and easy. Clinging to them only breeds greater complexity and difficulty, so one must seek instruction from a teacher.\n\nA question was raised regarding the *Record of the Unity of Immortals and Buddhas*, which cites Wang Yuyang’s poem: “One awakening to true emptiness completes the immortal’s path—how to awaken, how to complete?” The disciple asked for elucidation.\n\nThe Master said: This level of practice is still premature. For now, strive only to reach the state described as “dim and obscure, giving rise to the indistinct; from the indistinct, coalescing into a mass.” That will suffice.\n\nThe next day, the question was raised again.\n\nThe Master said: Internally, realize true emptiness, where not a single thought arises. As Master Ziyang said: “Deep in the night, the moon shines bright—heaven and earth, one mirror.” This is the initial nature, the wondrous nature of true suchness. Externally, true emptiness is also realized, with breath suspended and utter stillness. When both inner and outer attain the realm of true emptiness, they merge as one. Internally, the Seven Returns are accomplished; externally, the Nine Returns. As Ziyang said: “The inner medicine is like the outer; when the inner flows, the outer must also flow.” The key is to cultivate until inner and outer become two emptinesses, merging into one—then awakening naturally follows.\n\nFearing the Master’s impending seclusion would leave them adrift, the disciples asked for reassurance.\n\nThe Master said: Rest easy. I will not abandon you. When I withdraw, I will send word to you all. You may write to me two or three times a year—no need for more—so I may know your whereabouts and instruct my sons to look after you.\n\nThe disciple asked about the eight members of the Talks on the Dao Society, noting that aside from the Master and Elder Ke Huaijing, who had received transmission from Master Wu, the remaining six had been taught by the Master and Elder Ke.\n\nThe Master said: Of course. Master Wu instructed us two to transmit to them.\n\nThe disciple asked: Have they all attained the Dao?\n\nThe Master sighed: It is painful to speak of. Only Ke Zaishu remains; the rest have all passed away.\n\nShocked, the disciple asked the reason.\n\nThe Master said: At the time, the eight of us formed the Talks on the Dao Society and rented a room in a certain teahouse as our meeting place. We discussed the Dao daily, speaking with great enthusiasm. Though there were eight, only five were truly resolute in their pursuit of the Dao—myself, the Ke brothers, Zeng, and Zhou Jichang. The others merely had an affinity for the Dao and enjoyed discussing it.\n\nThe disciple asked about Ji Yunlan.\n\nThe Master said: He was among the eight, but later developed asthma and died.\n\nThe disciple asked about the one surnamed Zeng.\n\nThe Master said: He and Zhou Jichang had both made excellent progress. Later, Zeng was invited by a friend to a gathering at a certain guild hall. Before he could return, his home caught fire. Learning of it, he hurried back, but the streets were already choked with people—some watching the fire, others looting the scene. Anxious to check on his family, he forced his way through the crowd and perished.\n\nThough the crowd numbered in the thousands, once he forced his way in, his strength was spent—he could no longer push his way out. Trapped amid the throng, his feet still touching the ground, he was crushed from all sides by the press of bodies until he was broken. Later, he coughed up blood and died.\n\nThe disciple asked: Zhou Jichang had made such fine progress—why did he also die?\n\nThe Master said: That was his own undoing. He became entangled in some dispute and took it to court. When he lost the case, he was confined in the lockup for months. The frustration and distress left him unable to continue his practice, and he too succumbed to a fatal coughing sickness. (Note: The misfortunes that befell both Zeng and Zhou were demonic obstructions.)\n\nLater, only Ke Zaishu remained steadfast in his pursuit, applying himself with unrelenting effort. Of the eight, only the Master and the Ke brothers endured.\n\nThe disciple sighed deeply.\n\nThe Master continued: At that time, there were many fellow Dao-seekers in Hankou. Though the discussion group was formed by eight, there were others who did not join but came daily to the teahouse meeting place to speak of the Way. If you read Ke Huaijing’s *Nurturing Inner Nature*, you will see how many Dao-friends there were. Huaijing was skilled in poetry; whenever he met a fellow seeker, one would offer him a verse, another would present him with one, and he would compose one for me as well. Have you seen it?\n\nThe disciple replied: I have.\n\nThe Master said: In short, without applying oneself with unyielding effort, nothing is achieved.\n\nIf one’s daily practice has deep roots, even should one contract the blood-spitting illness, it is of no great concern. Thus *The Pointers to Nature and Life* says: “Entering the Dao is easy; guarding the Dao is hard”—not a whit in error. Again it is said: One must never interrupt one’s practice. If each day one devotes two or three hours to it, no illness, however severe, need be feared. Had I not applied myself thus, I would have died many times over. Hence the saying of Master Ziyang: “Only then did I know my fate was not ruled by Heaven.”\n\nThe Master continued: I met Sun Yuanbo later. He was a *juren* of the *jiazi* year. As for Master Wu, he spoke only a few words of *Journey to the West* when we first met, and afterward never discussed alchemical texts at all. On the very first day, he told us: “I have come here to transmit to you the oral instructions, not the books; to teach you how to practice, not how to expound the scriptures.” Sometimes Ke Huaijing and I would go to ask him about alchemical texts. Master Wu would reply: “Go and do the work first, then come back.” What could we do?\n\nAgain he said: Master Wu was not one for idle talk. After transmitting to us a few oral instructions, he would tell us to apply ourselves wholeheartedly to the practice. Only when we had reached that stage would he explain the finer points. If our practice had not yet reached the required level and we asked for further instructions, he would say: “Your practice has not yet reached that point. When it does, I will tell you.” We had no choice but to devote ourselves single-mindedly to the work.\n\nThe Master said: What I told you earlier were things I heard from heterodox and external schools. After meeting Master Wu, everything changed. Master Wu was truly formidable. On the second and third days after his arrival in Hankou, all the Dao-friends came to pay their respects and ask him questions. We were left speechless, staring blankly at one another like fools—completely different from the people we had met before. I asked the Grand Master Wu how he expounded the Dao. He did not discuss scriptures with you. All his questions concerned the precelestial; there was nothing about the postcelestial or the physical body. How were we to answer him? When one of the eight came to pay his respects, having completed the formalities, Master Wu would ask: “You too seek the Dao?” The disciple would say yes. Master Wu would then ask: “How many years have you studied?”\n\nHe replied, “I have studied for many years.” Master Wu then asked, “Having studied for so many years, have you ever seen what the Dao actually is?” The disciple answered, “I have not.” Master Wu pressed, “You have read countless alchemical texts and encountered the word *Dao* thousands of times—how can you say you have never seen it?” The disciple turned to us, speechless.\n\nThe Master said, “These few words alone should make your heart clear: the alchemical texts contain no Dao. They are but metaphors, traps, and snares.”\n\nAnother disciple came to pay his respects. After the formalities, Master Wu asked, “You too seek the Dao?” He answered yes. Master Wu then said, “If you have pursued the Dao for many years, do you know whether the Great Dao is precelestial or postcelestial?” The disciple replied, “It is precelestial.” Master Wu asked, “Then why does it become postcelestial?” The disciple said, “Because the body is broken.” Master Wu asked, “In that case, where has your precelestial gone?” The disciple was left speechless.\n\nKe Huaijing then interjected, “It has transformed.” Master Wu asked him, “Transformed into what?” Lord Ke, too, fell silent. I then said, “Once transformed, it scatters.” Master Wu asked, “Scatters where?” I, too, was left speechless. We all stared blankly at one another.\n\nMaster Wu then said, “It is like one who has lost something: to recover it, you must search where it was lost to return to the original state. If you lose a few silver coins on the street, you must look for them on the street; if you lose them in a shop, you must search that shop. Looking elsewhere would be labor in vain.”\n\nThe Master said, “In my *Three Teachings Harmonized*, several passages record Master Wu’s words.”\n\nAfter a few more days, Master Wu gathered us eight disciples and declared, “My energy is limited. I can only transmit the teachings to two of you. The remaining six may receive them later from these two—it will be as if I had taught you myself.” We all replied that we would abide by his choice. Master Wu said, “It is up to you; to me, you are all the same. You yourselves know best which two have studied the alchemical texts most deeply and mastered their principles.” Thus, he transmitted the teachings to Ke Huaijing and me.\n\nI asked about the other six. The Master said, “When they later encounter a true teacher, they will no longer study the Dao. They often say, ‘Once our family affairs are settled, we will follow you into seclusion. You two will be our teachers.’ But how could they wait for that?”\n\nChongxuzi said, *“Of old, a thousand sages were enlightened by breath—*\n*Clear inhalation and exhalation made them immortals.”*\nSuch words are truly deadly. They are no different from Muyuanzi’s *“When external yang stirs, it is the living midnight of the body.”* Once people read these lines, they begin manipulating their breath, fall into the postcelestial, cling to form, and stir the fire—illness is inevitable.\n\n(I said, “It should be revised to: *‘True breath made clear, one becomes immortal’*—only then does it accord with the profound mechanism.)\n\nI asked, “Baopuzi says, ‘Those who attain the Dao have square pupils.’ Is this true?” The Master replied, “It is.” I asked, “Why?”\n\nThe Master said, “It is the spirit that is numinous.”\n\nI asked about the *suozi* bones? The Master said, “The bones interlock like hooks and locks—this too is an auspicious sign of those who have attained the Dao.”\n\nCai Fuyang has assisted me greatly, yet he refuses to devote himself to practice. He says, “Let me settle my affairs first, then I will follow you to cultivate.” But this year has its affairs, and next year will have its own—who knows when his matters will ever be complete? In my view, only death brings completion; as long as one lives, affairs never end. Hearing this, I was deeply moved.\n\nPeople often say, “If immortality can be learned, why do we not see immortals in the world? It must be a deception, not worth believing.” This is a grave error. For when the principle remains unexhausted, the mind remains benighted, and one follows the common view. Yet the immortal is transformation. When a fish transforms into a dragon, it soars into the heavens and never returns to the water. Or take the water insects—hundreds swimming in the river—when one day they become mosquitoes, they ascend into the air and never return to the water. The immortal is no different. Once a person’s form is transformed into an immortal, they ride dragons and mount phoenixes, roaming the six directions, never again entering the turbid world to endure its filth. Why must they display supernatural powers or wield magical arts to convince the unbelieving?\n\nLong ago, when I first met Master Wu, he first instructed me to practice stillness for a month, then to listen to my breath with my ears. Little did I know that I would clench too tightly. Master Wu said, “Do not clench—this must never be forced. To clench is to cling to form, to fall into the postcelestial.” So I relaxed, but then fell into emptiness. Master Wu again said, “You cannot fall into emptiness. You must faintly perceive its coming and going, without attachment, letting it follow its nature.” Only then did I gradually grow adept.\n\nThe Master said, “Falling into emptiness merely yields no effect, but clinging to form will surely cause illness. If you can regulate it evenly, neither forgetting nor forcing, then it is balanced—ordinary breath naturally grows faint while true breath emerges. This is the true bellows, the true crucible and furnace.”\n\nHe further said, “When heart and breath align externally, the crucible and furnace are instantly established.”\n\nThe practice is transmitted in three stages. The first is refining the self and laying the foundation—what I have already explained to you. The second encompasses the firing times and transformations, including the minor celestial cycle, gathering the great medicine, passing the gates, and returning to the youthful body. The third is the final work of inherent nature—matters such as spirit departing the body and returning to emptiness, which is the completion of the Dao.\n\nWhen Meng Jun first wrote to me, he spoke of practicing the solar qi-refining method for ten years, exaggerating its merits. The Master said, “It is all misguided—why write about such things? You’ve practiced for ten years, yet you still leak essence. What kind of practice is that?” That is why I did not reply. Yet he writes again and again. I truly do not understand—how can a person be so muddled? He is pitiable, and I am vexed by him.\n\nI said, \"To be so muddled—this is also his virtue.\" Had I wished to be so muddled, I could not have achieved it. The Master laughed.\n\nHe then said, \"Old Meng is truly sincere, but he lacks adaptability. He has sent countless letters, all asking about mere words and images, and his questions never stray from the five detailed texts: *The Golden Immortal’s Verification of the Dao*, *The Sutra of the Wisdom-Life*, *The True Principle of Heavenly Immortality*, *The Unity of Immortals and Buddhas*, and *The Pointers on Nature and Life*. If I did not reply, he would suspect I did not understand the alchemical classics, so I had no choice but to explain in detail and instruct him not to cling to words or images. Yet he sees as if he does not see, persistently asking the same questions again and again, leaving me no peace. Later, I told him plainly that if he continued to ask the same old questions, I would not reply at all. Had I not said this, he would not have stopped. I had no other recourse but to be blunt with him.\"\n\nThe Master added, \"Fortunately, there is only one such person. If there were two or three, I would have no time left for my own practice. As for the solar qi-refining method, I once explained it to you—it is but an image. In essence, it is the interdependence of heart and breath, the unity of spirit and qi externally, with the heart as emptiness. When the heart is empty, its light shines downward like the sun illuminating all things, which the alchemical texts call 'turning the light around to reflect.' Since the heart’s light no longer flares upward but shines downward, the kidney-water naturally transforms into qi and rises, and the postnatal heart and kidneys spontaneously merge. Once heart and kidneys unite, the kidney-water no longer leaks, hence the saying: 'The solar qi-refining method governs men.' Beyond the interdependence of heart and breath, what else is there to the solar qi-refining method? Those of heterodox schools, failing to grasp this, cling to it and establish their own sects. Women belong to *kun*, so it is called lunar form-refining—yet is it not also the interdependence of heart and breath?\"\n\nI said, \"I heard Meng speak of the solar qi-refining method requiring wooden, stone, or iron mallets to strike along the body’s meridians.\"\n\nThe Master’s expression changed. \"How cruel! This is why the ancient immortals said, 'Seek the Dao among humanity.' They deeply despised such heterodox practices, which are inhuman and devoid of humaneness. Consider this: if the interdependence of heart and breath alone suffices to complete the Dao, why use wooden or iron mallets to strike the body? I have traveled everywhere in search of the Dao and seen all manner of strange things—most practitioners cling to one technique or method to astonish the common folk and dazzle with wonders. Yet when examined in truth, these have no relation to body, heart, nature, or life.\"\n\nThe Master then spoke of the \"true seed.\" \"The seed is that upon which all things depend for nurture and generation. As Lü Dongbin said, 'Heaven and earth cannot give birth to the myriad things; emptiness gives birth to heaven and earth.' Emptiness leaves no trace, yet it deeply embodies the nature of all things, and thus it can give birth to them. This emptiness is the true seed. Within emptiness, there is non-emptiness—a qi that flows without trace, hence the 'true seed.' The true seed is distinguished from the ordinary seed. As Zhang Sanfeng said, 'Seek the true seed where lightning flashes; find the original lineage when the wind’s signal comes.' The flash of lightning and the coming of the wind’s signal are the phenomena and signs of the stirring of the primal yang. The moment I perceive it, I swiftly act externally—is this not the true seed? The original lineage is emptiness.\n\n\"When you return home this time, apply yourself diligently. During practice, never close your eyes—keep them open. Regardless of distance, fix your gaze on one object or place, neither clinging nor departing. After a while, you need only faintly know that you are focused externally—this is the interdependence. Neither falling into emptiness nor attaching to form, muddled yet with all thoughts dissolved, drifting as if floating, seemingly present yet absent, in a moment of vagueness and obscurity, the external yang stirs. The instant you perceive it, swiftly turn to the interdependence of heart and breath externally—do not delay. The slightest delay turns the primal into the postnatal. If you then attach to the body, there is the danger of leaking essence, and all is lost. This arising of yang is the postnatal’s primal. The moment you perceive it is also the postnatal’s primal. You must again practice the interdependence.\n\n\"Depend until you reach the state of vagueness and obscurity, then profound stillness. With prolonged stillness, internal and external merge, movement and stillness both vanish, self and form forgotten, unaware and unknowing—this is the extreme of emptiness and the depth of quiescence, the entire body numb. With further stillness, the body inside and out pulses as one. Any illness, once this stage is reached, will be entirely cured. Not only will illness be cured, but the postnatal physical body’s yang will also arise.\"\n\nThe Master said, \"At this stage of extreme emptiness and profound stillness, both inside and outside the body are primal. You are like a living corpse. If primal qi arrives, your heart does not stir in the slightest, yet your spirit naturally goes outward to depend on the breath, without the slightest intention or force intervening—this is called natural mastery. This is the primal’s primal. Again, externally interdepend, and once more reach the state of vagueness and obscurity. With prolonged stillness, profound tranquility returns, and again internal and external merge, all a thousand miles clear, the entire body numb, the entire body pulsing.\"\n\nAs long as you enter the state of vagueness and obscurity three or four times a day, you will be free from illness all year round—this is the secret to preserving the body.\n\nIn the past, when Confucius was about to depart, Laozi said to him, \"The noble one bestows words as gifts, while the petty one offers material goods.\" Now, I too embody this sentiment, presenting these teachings as a parting gift to you both.\n\nThis time, I accompanied Master Tang to visit the teacher and receive instruction. The practice of \"heart and breath interdepending\" may seem utterly ordinary when spoken aloud, so most people dismiss it as tasteless and abandon it. Yet who knows that within this tastelessness lies the most profound flavor?\n\nWhen asked how to close the \"Gate of Yang,\" the Master replied: If you can enter the state of vagueness and obscurity at any time, it will close of itself without your seeking to close it.\n\nThe Master sighed deeply and said: Those who have not obtained the method seek the method, while those who have obtained it become obsessed with reading books instead of practicing—what benefit is there in this? Therefore, you must devote yourselves to practice. All alchemical texts can be set aside entirely; do not waste your energy studying them. This is the unvarnished truth.\n\nPlants and trees return to their roots in winter, sprouting anew the following year, and returning to their roots again the next winter—thus they endure. Most people meet their end because they cannot return to their roots like plants and trees. The method of \"heart and breath interdepending\" that I teach you is the way of returning to the root.\n\nReturning to the root means the spirit and qi return to their source, neither issuing forth nor entering in—just as the leaves of plants and trees fall in the depths of winter. If you can return to the root, when the first yang revives, you will restore your mandate. Returning to the root is the great stillness, where body and mind are both quiescent, the ordinary breath dissolves, and the alchemical classics call this \"embracing the primordial in emptiness and peril.\"\n\nThereafter, \"three days after the emergence of geng\" marks the message of reviving the mandate. Returning to the root is the first step of the work. Returning to the state of an infant is the second step. Returning to the Wuji is the third step—this is the initial attainment of stillness. Next, one reverts to the body of a youth, knowing nothing, aware of nothing. In the end, one shatters the void to perceive the entire body.\n\nCultivating the Dao is like eating sugarcane: the closer you get to the root, the sweeter it becomes. It is also like climbing a height: with every foot ascended, the view grows broader.\n\nThis treasure of emptiness is priceless, for no one dares set a value on it. The *Preface to Laozi’s Profound Insight* in *Fanghu Waishi* is excellent, though Zhao’s preface is not.\n\nSomeone asked me to explain the lines, \"Abide in constant non-desire to observe its mystery; abide in constant desire to observe its gateway.\" I did not respond. The Master said: It means \"heart and breath interdepending.\" The spirit is fundamentally non-active, yet the mechanism of qi cannot remain unmoving. It is always the interdependence of being and non-being.\n\nAnother asked about the lines, \"Know the white, guard the black; know the male, guard the female.\" The Master himself explained: These too refer to \"heart and breath interdepending.\"\n\nOf the ten thousand volumes of alchemical texts, only these four characters—\"heart and breath interdepending\"—matter. Hence it is said, \"Ten thousand scrolls of immortal scriptures are unlocked by a single phrase.\" The method my teacher Wu transmitted to me was precisely these four characters. Apart from \"heart and breath interdepending,\" there is not a single word beyond it—thus, \"When the Dao is spoken, it is bland and without flavor.\"\n\nIf you cultivate \"heart and breath interdepending\" to its ultimate point, you will reach the stage of ascension. Most people do not believe this because they know but do not practice, practice but not diligently, or practice diligently but not persistently. With such an approach, how can one hope to become an immortal or patriarch? Though it is but a single phrase of four characters, some spend their entire lives without mastering it—it is truly not easy. Do not underestimate it.\n\nFrom non-being to being, from following emotions to aligning with nature—all are the work of \"heart and breath interdepending.\" The two characters \"refining the self\" are spoken of lightly, but how easy is it? Once the self is refined to perfection, all subsequent work becomes effortless. The difficulty lies precisely in refining the self. The self is one’s own nature.\n\nMaster Meng’s view that \"no-thought\" constitutes refining the self is a grave error. If no-thought were refining the self, why seek a teacher? Because Master Meng remains so muddled even now, I am truly displeased.\n\nThe Master said: In the golden elixir, there is only one practice from beginning to end—refining the self. When this is brought to its ultimate point, one can project the spirit.\n\nI wrote to him with good intentions, saying I would transmit to him the method of refining the self. He replied: \"Refining the self is nothing more than no-thought. I already know this; there is no need for you to repeat it.\" Alas, this is the harm of being too familiar with the books of Wu and Liu. Had I spoken to him of the Greater and Lesser Celestial Cycles, he would have been overjoyed. He even said to me: \"There is no Greater or Lesser Celestial Cycle. These terms were all fabricated by Wu Chongxu.\" As for the Celestial Cycle, the *Xuan Yao* mentions it in seven or eight places.\n\nI asked: \"Last summer, you transmitted to me the method of refining the self. Why are you teaching it again this year?\" The Master replied: \"Last summer’s transmission was incomplete. Now I will teach you the fire phases in detail, until external yang no longer arises—then you will have a firm grasp.\" At that moment, my heart was filled with gratitude beyond words.\n\nA child’s heart and breath naturally interdepend, so they need only still themselves to enter the state of vagueness and obscurity.\n\nFor the works of Wu and Liu, I have expended untold ink and breath. Every good alchemical text begins by speaking of the interdependence of heart and breath—eschewing empty talk, rejecting names and forms. It teaches: *\"To cultivate stillness in the Li Palace, one must observe the return; to seek the mysterious in the Water Mansion, one must again observe.\"* The Master said: \"The first line speaks of movement reaching its extreme and turning to stillness—entering the state of vagueness, obscurity, primordial chaos, and emptiness: this is true stillness. The second line speaks of stillness reaching its extreme and turning to movement—revealing the heart of Heaven and Earth, as external yang arises from the midst of emptiness.\"\n\nThe Master asked: \"In monasteries, those who sit in meditation must become like living corpses. We who cultivate the Dao must also become like living corpses.\" I was asked: \"What is the difference between these two kinds of living corpses?\" I had no reply. The Master said: \"Theirs have breath; ours have no breath. Breath belongs to yin; breathlessness belongs to yang. The two are vastly different—do not confuse them as one. What use is 'no-thought'? It is ten thousand miles from the Dao. The *Qingjing Jing* states: *'Those who can awaken to this may transmit the sagely Dao.'* Only when one reaches the state of no-thought may the Dao be transmitted. To take no-thought itself as the Dao is to stray far indeed. Of the ten thousand volumes of alchemical texts, only Laozi’s six characters—*'attain utmost emptiness, guard deep stillness'*—are essential. The Buddhist master Zhi Zhe said: *'If one can sit in stillness and turn the light inward, one will see the old master of one’s former life.'* The Master said: 'If you understand these five characters—*\"sit in stillness and turn the light inward\"*—that is enough. You need not read the ten thousand volumes of alchemical texts.'\"\n\nRefining the self is not the same as no-thought; they are two distinct matters, not one. No-thought inevitably clings to the physical body—either spitting blood or leaking essence, with no hope of escape. These two matters refer to cultivating the Dharma-body while also tending to the physical body, what is called *'Heaven and man unite in arising, the foundation of the myriad transformations is set.'*\n\nThe Master’s daughter-in-law fell ill, as did his granddaughter—both with cold damage. The daughter-in-law’s condition was critical; Western physicians had given up hope, yet she later took a turn for the better and survived. The Master himself fell ill, with wind, cold, water, and dampness all assailing his body. The Western physicians said, given his advanced age, he might not endure. The Master replied: \"I will apply effort. A noble person must attend to the root. The interdependence of heart and breath is the root of curing illness.\" Who could have known that, upon applying effort, his entire body’s joints would feel as if drilled by an awl? For four days and four nights, he finally expelled the wind, cold, water, and dampness from his body. The Master said: \"When illness strikes, the Dao becomes truly valuable.\"\n\nZhen Qing said: \"During a great plague in a certain year of the Guangxu era, the Master also fell ill, growing dizzy and collapsing after every three steps. At that time, his heart and breath remained interdependent, under his control. After three days and nights of effort, he vomited a basin of black blood and recovered. This was another great tribulation—he had endured four or five such crises by then.\" The Master said: \"When illness reaches this stage, even Wu, Liu, and others—at the level they were when writing their books—would have died, with no hope of escape. Not to mention Wu and Liu; even Lu Qianxu, when he wrote the *Fanghu Waishi*, would have perished from such an illness. You praise the *Fanghu Waishi*, yet do you know that the level of skill described in its pages still could not avert death?\" I asked why. The Master said: \"Your own cultivation is shallow, so when you read alchemical texts, you cannot discern the level of skill the authors had attained at the time. I, however, can tell at a glance how far their cultivation had progressed.\"\n\nHe continued: \"Liu Wuyuan had already applied great effort when he wrote his books, placing him far above Lu Qianxu. Yet because he had read few alchemical texts, his writing often lacked substance, verging on empty talk. Still, in every piece, there were one or two uniquely insightful phrases—truly astonishing. This was the fruit of his deep cultivation, beyond the reach of ordinary people.\" The Master once said: \"Wuyuan either says nothing, or when he speaks, it stuns people.\"\n\n\"When Zhu Yuanyu wrote his books, his cultivation had already declined by half—otherwise, he could not have mastered so many alchemical texts. Thus, those who do not relinquish worldly affairs never succeed; those who cling to their homes remain in peril.\"\n\nAt this moment, we who live in the world are all like rootless trees, drifting with the wind—today unaware of what tomorrow may bring. How can this not strike the heart with alarm?\n\nWhen heart and breath interdepend, each trace of awareness introduces a trace of the postnatal, a trace of failure to attain perfect spontaneity. Only when heart and breath constantly interdepend, always merging as one, does stillness naturally lead into the state of rapt absorption.\n\nThe purpose of our Dao cultivation lies in leaving behind the tangible physical body. Thus, from the very beginning, we must project our spirit beyond the body into the empty void—this is the first step in separating it from the physical form. For each moment the primordial spirit abides steadily in the void, the power to relinquish the physical body grows stronger. In plain terms, its connection to the physical body weakens by that degree. With long and pure practice, the dharmakāya can remain steadily outside, no longer needing this physical form, and becomes entirely separate from it. This is what is called \"shedding the womb.\"\n\nWhen the spirit attains great stillness, the breath ceases to move in and out. Once the spirit is settled outside, detached from this physical body and no longer clinging to it, it becomes purely prenatal. True yang from the void constantly gathers with it, and the dharmakāya gradually grows and becomes more numinous. Over time, it can leave stillness and stand alone, achieve spirit travel—how wondrous!\n\nThe *Xingming Guizhi* states: \"In cultivation, be a guest seeking long life; in refining nature, be like a living corpse.\" The term \"living corpse\" is apt, but one must distinguish carefully. A corpse with breath is purely yin, postnatal—worthless. A \"living corpse\" without breath is purely yang, prenatal—such a one can truly ascend. What is written on paper can only convey *being*; it cannot convey *non-being*. What is spoken aloud can only express *being*; it cannot express *non-being*.\n\nThus, whatever is written in books or spoken aloud is never the Dao. If one wishes to personally witness the profound mystery of the void, there is no alternative but to apply oneself to practice. When others cultivate, the moment external yang stirs, they take it as a great sign of efficacy and treasure it—yet this is precisely where leakage occurs. Those who cultivate well experience no stirring of yang. Any stirring of yang arises solely from failing to swiftly detach from the physical body; it is not of the prenatal but has already turned a thought or a clinging to the body into the postnatal. To cling to the postnatal body and thereby provoke the stirring of external yang is to practice incorrectly.\n\nThe Master further said: In the state of extreme emptiness and profound stillness, if external yang stirs slightly, swiftly detach from the body and remain outside, relying on it. With breath entirely stilled, how could yang stir? If it becomes firm and erect, the matter is already spoiled. Thus, one must act before it stirs—this fleeting moment of subtle application is also called \"encounter within the flickering and indistinct.\"\n\nThe Master further said: All who cultivate to the point of external yang stirring are clinging to the physical body, mistaking the thief for their own child. \"The zither’s heart in triple measure dances with the embryonic immortal\"—this \"triple measure\" is the \"three returns\" of the *Yinfu Jing*, namely the three barriers: refining essence into qi, refining qi into spirit, and refining spirit to return to the void.\n\nOrdinary people, from dawn to dusk, ceaselessly and recklessly engage in actions that harm life. By day, they exhaust their spirit; by night, they indulge in desire to deplete their essence. When essence, spirit, and qi are nearly spent, illness follows. The *Baopuzi* states: \"A finite thing cannot supply an endless drain; the flow of rivers cannot fill a bottomless vessel.\" If one whose income is meager yet expenses vast cannot make ends meet, how much less can one with no income at all sustain a thousandfold outflow?\n\nThe Master said: I transmit the method of heart and breath interdependence to gather the prenatal, replenishing what has been damaged and depleted—this is the way to \"earn money.\" For every portion of qi earned, one gains a portion of treasure; for five portions of qi earned, five portions of treasure—this is a method of boundless profit, a certainty. One need only be willing to practice, to apply oneself with utter devotion.\n\nZhuangzi said: \"Heaven and Earth possess great beauty yet do not speak\"—this great beauty is the singular qi. The *Xinyin Jing* speaks of \"revolving wind merging in harmony, a hundred days’ work manifesting efficacy,\" or of \"reverting the light to illumine within.\" Though the words differ, those with the Dao know the practice is the same. \"Revolving wind merging\" is \"reverting the light\"; \"reverting the light\" is \"revolving wind merging\"—one in two, two in one.\n\nI asked how one knows they are the same. The Master said: Wind is breath. \"Revolving wind merging\" means uniting spirit with breath, breath with spirit. In essence, it is the interdependence of heart and breath, merging spirit and qi as one. \"Reverting the light\" means the fire of the heart, which naturally flames upward, is now made to turn its light downward. To \"illumine\" is to shine upon the water of the kidneys. When the heart’s light descends, the kidney’s water naturally ascends—extracting from Kan to fill Li, the task is complete. This is the natural effect within the physical body. If discussed externally, \"reverting the light\" is simply the interdependence of heart and breath.\n\nTen thousand volumes of alchemical texts, expounded again and again, ultimately describe nothing but the four characters: \"heart and breath interdependent.\" Though the discourse may seem engaging, shifting from this to that with great delight, it all comes down to three words one cannot master, cannot achieve. They speak of the external mysterious pass.\n\nThe Master said: When heart and breath interdepend outside, this is the external mysterious pass. The mysterious pass is the most wondrous mechanism. Ke Huaijing said: \"The mysterious pass arises only after spirit and qi unite\"—this is well put. For when spirit and qi merge, the mysterious pass forms. If heart and breath do not interdepend in ordinary times, spirit and qi do not unite, and there is no mysterious pass.\n\nIn learning the Dao, the most precious thing is to receive the complete fire-phase. Yet teachers are reluctant to transmit it lightly, for it involves the transformations of each stage of the fire-phase. The value of the Dao lies precisely here. If you cannot realize it yourself, you will only attain what is transmitted to you, stopping there. Without further guidance from the teacher, you will not know what follows. Thus, the ancients practiced under their masters.\n\nThe subtleties of the fire-phase are many. Once transmitted, you have a foundation. With its minute transformations, you will naturally discern and comprehend everything when the time comes. Among my disciples, only one, surnamed Wang—a relative of mine—has received the complete fire-phase. A few others have received half, but I do not transmit it lightly. Some claim to possess it, yet when it comes to practice, they have nothing.\n\nThus, the living zi and living wu, the furnace and cauldron, the celestial orbit, the gathering, refining, and forging—all are but ink on paper. The *Cantong Qi* says: \"Use the non-existent to control the existent; the vessel’s use lies in its emptiness.\" How profound! This refers to the oral instructions of the great Dao, the most difficult to obtain being the complete fire-phase. This \"complete\" is no easy matter. My twenty-odd years of seeking were for the sake of obtaining the complete oral instructions of the fire-phase. Thus, the complete fire-phase is the true treasure.\n\nQianxuzi said: \"A once-in-a-millennium encounter\"—this is no empty words. While other aspects may be realized through personal insight, the fire-phase cannot be self-realized. Hence, Xue Zixian said: \"The sages transmit the medicine but not the fire; the fire-phase has always been known by few.\"\n\n\"Do not treat the great Dao as child’s play; you must deliberate it alongside immortals. *‘Push aside the iron face my mother bore—make you and I as steady as can be, make yin and yang topple and invert.’* These three lines, each one a transformation of the fire-phase—grasp this, and it is enough.\n\nThe essence of refining the self lies in the seven characters the ancients spoke: *‘Seal the senses, lower the lids, and silently observe.’* *‘Empty the heart, fill the belly’*—this is the true meaning of the Dao. Yet to fill the belly, one must first empty the heart. When the heart is empty, the primordial yang of heaven and earth naturally arrives, and the belly fills of itself. All ordinary people, their deluded thoughts surging, their essence leaking—how empty or full they are may be known. Thus, the two words *‘empty the heart’* are the bridge to entering the Dao.\n\nOnce you obtain the oral instructions and begin cultivation, from this day forth, you may ensure essence does not leak. Though the fire-phase is said to be difficult to know and difficult to practice, if I explain it to you plainly, it is in fact most simple and most easy. Dan Yang said: *‘The entire method of the elixir, from beginning to end, lies in nothing more than the four words *heart and breath interdependent.* Where there is a fire-phase for each stage, it is but the transformations within the interdependence of heart and breath at each stage. In sum: it is natural.’*\n\nAmong all elixir texts, whether poems, lyrics, songs, rhapsodies, discourses, or commentaries, those that contain the fire-phase are true scriptures; those without are false. No matter how grandly they speak, it is of no use. Thus, I need only read two or three pages to judge their authenticity. If it is poetry, three to five verses suffice to discern the truth.\n\nMaster Sanfeng’s lines—*‘Displaying divine powers, planting lotuses in raging fire; wielding the craftsman’s hand, poling a boat in weak waters’*—are all secret teachings of the fire-phase. Liu Huayang said: *‘When the root of lust and the mechanism of desire stir, refine them with wind and fire, and the external yang will naturally recede.’* This, too, speaks of the fire-phase.\n\nAmong the elixir texts of various schools, all mention the fire-phase, but none so well as the *Wuzhen Pian*—every verse speaks of it. Previously, due to illness, I had just emerged from the gate of death, my spirit utterly depleted, and thus truly could not attend to you. Today, your arrival is timely; I will speak with you in detail about where to begin.\n\nGenerally, in learning the Dao, one must first understand the two eight trigrams of Fuxi and King Wen—prior-heaven and posterior-heaven. The *Book of Changes* is a work jointly authored by the Four Sages; those two eight trigrams are the origin of both Confucianism and Daoism. Even the *Yinfu Jing*, *Daode Jing*, *Great Learning*, and *Doctrine of the Mean* do not lie beyond their scope. Therefore, those who study the Dao yet do not comprehend these two eight trigrams will fail to understand elixir texts, grasping only branches and leaves while neglecting the root.\n\nNow, I shall reveal their secrets to you. Fuxi’s prior-heaven eight trigrams—with *Qian* in the south and *Kun* in the north—are the trigrams of the unbroken, youthful body. Within and without the body, all is prior-heaven. Cultivating this, through clarity and non-action, one may complete the Dao without need for return—this is what is meant by *‘the highest virtue acts not.’*\n\nKing Wen’s posterior-heaven eight trigrams, however, relegate *Qian* and *Kun* to useless positions, replacing them with *Li* and *Kan*—the trigrams of our already-broken bodies. Once the body is broken, the prior-heaven pure yang is lost. If at this point one relies solely on King Wen’s posterior-heaven eight trigrams to seek life, one can never return to the root and restore the origin. As Lu Qianxu said: *‘Once the wine and sweet liquor have been uncovered, no matter how tightly you seal the vessel, you cannot prevent spoilage.’* Thus, to return to the root and restore the origin, one must seek it in Fuxi’s prior-heaven eight trigrams—this is the *‘external move’* of the body, what is called prior-heaven.\n\nIn the prior-heaven eight trigrams, *Qian* and *Kun* serve as the gate and door—these are the two words *heart* and *breath*. Below *Qian* and above *Kun* lies the circle, the void—this is called the Yellow Way. *Qian* is the crucible, *Kun* the furnace. When heart and breath interdepend, the furnace and crucible are formed. The furnace must be empty, the crucible must be empty—thus, heart and breath must rely within the void. As Zi Yang said: *‘Having driven the two things into the Yellow Way’*—once the two things enter the Yellow Way, naturally *‘you will effortlessly obtain the golden elixir.’*\n\nThis is the harmony of yin and yang giving rise to transformation—the work of life outside the body, the natural action of prior-heaven. When *Qian* and *Kun* return to the Yellow Way, that is, when heart and breath interdepend externally, the posterior-heaven *Li* and *Kan* naturally unite. *Li* is the heart, *Kan* the belly. When heart and breath interdepend externally, within the colored body, the heart-fire naturally descends—this is the heart-light shining downward. As the heart-light shines downward, the kidney-water naturally ascends. The union of *Kan* and *Li* is the inner nature and principle of this body—the natural non-action of posterior-heaven.\n\nZi Yang said: *‘Within, there is a natural true fire; in the furnace, a radiant, enduring glow.’* This is the effect that arises of itself—no need to manage it. All fires in the world blaze upward, yet only the sun shines downward. All waters in the world flow downward, yet only the tide surges upward. Thus it is said: *‘Heaven responds to the stars, earth responds to the tide.’* Clearly, the reversal of prior-heaven transformation and the forward movement of posterior-heaven transformation are vastly different.\n\nThose who study the Dao practice reversing posterior-heaven to become prior-heaven. Thus, when heart and breath unite as one, the heart becomes empty. When the heart is empty, the false yang on either side of the *Li* trigram (that is, the heart-fire) naturally ceases to blaze upward and instead shines downward. The liquid of wood (the true yin within *Li*) thereby does not wither—elixir texts call this *‘calming the fire to nourish wood.’*\"\n\nThe illumination shines upon the two false yin of the *Kan* trigram (that is, the kidney-water). Once kidney-water is illuminated by heart-fire, it naturally ceases to flow downward and instead transforms into qi, ascending upward. With the water thus ascending, only the single line within *Kan* remains—is this not refining water to become metal? Thus, by calming the fire to nourish wood, one naturally refines water to become metal.\n\nOriginally, the wood-liquid within *Li* is an old substance of the *Kun* earth, being true yin. The true metal within *Kan* is an old substance of the *Qian* heaven, being true yang. As it is said: *“That which originates from heaven inclines upward; that which originates from earth inclines downward,”* each following its kind. Therefore, when the adept reaches the state of utmost emptiness and profound stillness, a yang qi suddenly surges upward—is this not the *Qian* metal within *Kan* turning upward? Alchemical texts call this *“the tiger arising from within water.”* As the yang qi surges upward, a true liquid suddenly descends within the heart—is this not the wood-liquid of *Li* descending? Alchemical texts call this *“the dragon emerging from within fire.”* Thus it is said: *“When sweet dew descends, heaven and earth unite; where yellow sprouts arise, Kan and Li intersect.”* It is also called *“taking from Kan to fill Li,”* meaning to fill the emptiness within *Li* with the fullness of *Kan*. Thereby, *Qian* and *Kun* settle into their positions, and the elixir is formed.\n\nYet this speaks only of principle; the method is not quite so. The master further said: The two outer yin of *Kan* are posterior-heaven water, that is, leaking essence. Now, when heart-fire steams it, the water, being steamed by fire, gradually transforms into qi and ascends. Each time the work is done, a portion of the water is refined away. With prolonged effort, the water is entirely transformed, and yin is exhausted while yang is pure—external yang can no longer rise. For when yin essence is fully transformed, the root of lust is eradicated, and there is no principle by which it could rise. If external yang stirs even slightly, a portion of yin essence remains unrefined. Only when external yang ceases all movement is yin essence fully transformed. The above speaks of principle. The progress of the work is but a single matter of steadiness.\n\nKnow that refining essence into qi depends on steadiness. Refining qi into spirit depends on steadiness. Refining spirit to return to emptiness also depends on steadiness. Thus the scripture says: *“Great steadiness perfects the true.”* And again: *“Within steadiness, the elixir is seen to form.”* And: *“In prolonged steadiness, spirit, wisdom, and power manifest.”*\n\nDiscussing the two “return” characters, Lu Qianxu said:\n*“Within Li, cultivate steadiness by observing return;\nWithin the water府, seek the mysterious by observing return.\nObserve return, return to observe, observe return again—\nOnly then will you know the wondrous subtlety of the two mysteries.”*\n\nThe master said: This elucidates Laozi’s chapter on *“attaining utmost emptiness and guarding profound stillness.”* Know that Laozi’s observation of return proceeds from stillness to movement: the prior-heaven one qi moves to its extreme and becomes still, then from stillness returns to movement. *“These two emerge together yet differ in name; together they are called the mysterious,”* which is the purport of observing the wondrous and observing the subtlety.\n\nFrom the interdependence of heart and breath to the state of steadiness, where inhalation and exhalation cease—like the roots of plants and trees in deep winter—this is called the first mystery, the observation of the wondrous. When steadiness reaches its extreme and movement arises, it is the natural cyclic mechanism of heaven and earth. Thus, within steadiness, yang is born, revealing the heart of heaven and earth, and the work of gathering and refinement begins—this is the second mystery, the observation of the subtlety. Together, they are called the two mysteries. Thus it is said: *“Mysterious, and again mysterious—the gateway to all wonders.”* Know that the two mysteries emerge from the gateway of all wonders, and the gateway of all wonders is called emptiness.\n\nThis time, due to my daughter-in-law and granddaughter’s grave illness, my heart grew anxious, and the four evils—wind, cold, water, and dampness—all assailed my body. I hurriedly applied the work, but upon falling asleep, chaotic dreams arose like mountains. I knew this time would not end well. Why?\n\nWhen a person nears death, the spirit becomes confused and disordered. With the spirit in such turmoil, how can one stabilize and retain the qi? Thus, the practice of heart and breath interdependence becomes ineffective. At this stage, my heart was filled with dread. Yet I persisted with utmost effort, practicing continuously for four days and nights, only then dispelling the chaotic dreams and feeling a slight ease in my heart. Thereafter, I practiced without distinction of day or night for another seven days, gradually expelling the wind and cold. Only then did I realize I might not die after all.\n\nNow, I still practice daily, engaging in nothing else, intending to continue for a hundred days to fully restore my lost vitality. This is within my grasp, and my calculations are sound. Thus, when gravely ill, the true value of the Dao becomes evident.\n\nFrom now on, if you wish to study, read Zhang Sanfeng’s *Essentials of the Mysterious*. Should you comprehend even half of it, when I discuss the firing times with you, you will grasp them with ease.\n\nWang Hunran was a disciple of Qiu Changchun. Upon their meeting, they found such mutual resonance that their bond was profound. They conversed for over ten days. One day, Changchun called him and said: “Do you believe the Dao ends here? That cultivating it leads directly to its realization?”\n\nHunran, startled, remained silent for a long while before replying: “You have already revealed the great essentials of the Dao. How could cultivating it not lead to its realization?”\n\nChangchun said: “All that I have discussed with you thus far is but the dregs of the Dao. Its true secret lies in the firing times. Consider this: do you truly understand the subtleties of each stage of the firing process?”\n\nHunran then bowed and sought further instruction. Changchun proceeded to elucidate its intricacies in detail, exhausting its profound depths.\n\nThe master said: “Since ancient times, when a true teacher encounters a worthy disciple, this is how it has always been. In refining the self, one must attain a body like the great void, a heart transcending all things, unstained by even a speck of dust, and the six senses in perfect stillness—only then can one proceed to higher matters. As Zhang Sanfeng said:\n\n*‘I am a sea of purity, unstained by even a speck of dust.\nI am a luminous pearl, suspended in the emptiness.\nI am an iron steamed bun, too hard to bite.\nI am a touchstone, revealing all grades of gold.’*\n\nIf one can embody these four lines, no barrier will remain unbroken, and the attainment of the Dao is certain.”\n\nHe further stated: “In refining the self, one must take these four lines of Zhang Sanfeng as the standard. Otherwise, the work remains incomplete.”\n\nZhen Qing said: “When a practitioner senses the primordial qi, it must be preserved with utmost care. Never, upon feeling an improvement in vitality, engage in frivolous activities that waste spirit. If today you gain a measure of primordial qi, guard that measure and allow no further dissipation. Should you indulge in grand discourse, the qi you have gathered will be expended. To gain and then lose it—is this not a pity?\n\nI have observed opium smokers: when the craving arises, their sole thought is of smoking, nothing else. After a few pipes, their vitality improves, their spirits lift, and they seek company to converse with, laughing loudly and jesting endlessly. Practitioners of the Dao are no different. When the work reaches the state of utter emptiness and profound stillness, one can attract the true yang from without, and vitality naturally improves. Yet if one gathers it day after day, vitality grows daily, and feeling no outlet for it, one may devise all manner of unnecessary tasks—engaging in grand discourse, seeking labor, refusing rest—thereby covertly transforming the gathered primordial qi into mundane vitality and squandering it. This point is of utmost importance and must be guarded against.”\n\nHe also said: “If, at the outset, the work of refining the self is deep, the heart free of stray thoughts, and the body like the great void, then such issues will not arise in later practice. Their occurrence is always due to the impurity of self-refinement.”\n\nThe necessity of a companion in Daoist practice arises precisely for this reason. In the *Collected Works of Bai Ziqing*, there is a piece titled *The Hook-and-Lock Linked Cycle*, beginning with “The golden elixir is none other than mercury” and continuing until it reaches the utmost heights. By reading this, you will understand that the great Dao of the primordial is truly the simplest and easiest. Yet people seek only its branches and leaves, failing to recognize that *“the primordial chaos of emptiness and nothingness is the ancestral origin.”*\n\nThe *Great Cavern Scripture* states: *“Abide in the great nothingness beyond,”* teaching one to remain in the emptiness outside, nurturing the dharmakāya with the true yang of the void. Lü Zu’s *Hundred-Character Tablet* says: *“In movement and stillness, know the ancestral origin,”* referring to the emptiness beyond, from which one must not depart even for a moment. *“Comprehending the foundation of kan and li”* also pertains to this external dimension. Each day, if you rest your heart and breath in the external, the true bellows and crucible will form instantly. This is an exceedingly simple matter.\n\nThe *Guidelines* states: *“When a single thought stirs, it is all fire; when the myriad conditions are still, spring arises.”* A single thought stirring generates deviant fire; when thoughts follow one after another, the deviant fire burns ever more fiercely. When the myriad conditions are stilled, body and mind are at leisure and peace, and thus spirit and qi harmonize, as if in the midst of spring.\n\nThe Dao gathers in emptiness, so one must turn outward from within, merging spirit and qi in the void. Zhuangzi said: *“Only the Dao gathers in emptiness,”* and again: *“Refine it further and further, until it ascends to heaven.”* Here, “heaven” also refers to the void. He further said: *“When arranged and departed, transformation enters the vast and solitary heaven.”* The “vast and solitary heaven” likewise refers to the void.\n\nOther terms such as the \"Gate of Myriad Wonders\" and the \"Mysterious Female Gate\" likewise refer to the void. The Master said: *“I transmit to you two essential verses—commit them firmly to memory: ‘Spirit and qi enter the void; return to the void and merge into the primordial.’ As long as the primordial chaos remains undying, you too shall not perish.”* The *Classic of Purity* states: *“If one can abide in constant clarity and stillness, heaven and earth will all return.”* Here, “heaven and earth” denote the microcosm of the human body, not the macrocosm beyond the body. The *Four-Hundred-Character Inscription* says: *“Chaos enfolds the void; the void enfolds the Three Realms. Yet when one traces their root-source, it is but a grain of millet.”* The Master said: *“If you attain chaos, it encompasses all—truly, this is ‘one resolves a hundred matters.’”* Thus Lü Dongbin spoke of *“the true secret lies hidden in chaos.”* When spirit and qi return to their root, this means they return to the void, merging with the vast darkness into oneness. External paths, unaware, claim that “returning to the root” means the breath settling below the navel—thus they remain fixated on the foul skin-bag.\n\nZhang Sanfeng’s *Twenty-Four Songs of the Rootless Tree* are fine, yet they do not match the *Twelve Daoist Ballads of Sweeping Light* in directness and forthrightness, which lay bare the liver and gall to reveal the truth. Observe its words: *“Sweep with light, and the true is revealed.”* And again: *“Sweep with light, and the One is revealed.”* Its closing lines say: *“Nature returns to life, life returns to heaven, and returning life merges into chaos before time.”* How excellent these three phrases are—better than reading ten thousand volumes of alchemical texts. The *Daoist Ballads of Sweeping Light* state: *“To brighten the eyes, one must read the wordless sutra.”* And further: *“The body is not the Dao; the Dao is not the mind. Do not mistake body and mind for the true person.”* Thus one must not cling to the colored form in seeking clarity.\n\nLü Dongbin’s *Song of Knocking on Hexagrams*, though spanning thousands of words, contains much figurative language that leads one astray. You must focus on its pivotal line. Where is this pivot? It says: *“Above the Great Void, the true cultivator—luminous and perfect, nothing remains. Nothing remains, only the Dao is manifest; from the five directions emerges the true person’s visage.”* These seven words—*“luminous and perfect, nothing remains”*—reveal the meaning of attaining true emptiness, surpassing even the earlier lines: *“Dim and obscure, born of vagueness; vague and indistinct, coalescing into form.”* This is the authentic transmission of the pillar’s profound teaching, the supreme and most true wondrous Dao. If one follows Liao Chanhui’s words—*“Facing the navel wheel behind, the kidneys; between them lies the true golden crucible”*—one has entered the demonic path.\n\nThe closing passage of the *Song of Knocking on Hexagrams* says: *“Day and night, they toil and call in vain; seizing profit and contending for fame like a boiling cauldron.”* Each time I read this, I sigh deeply.\n\nOn the firing process:\nThe Master said: *“Fu Xi’s diagram is the firing process—from Qian it gradually moves to Kun, and from Kun it gradually returns to Qian. This is gradual, not achieved in a single leap.”* Thus the *Scripture of Yin Convergence* states: *“The Dao of heaven and earth is gradual.”* After the Great Heat comes the Beginning of Autumn, cooling bit by bit; from the Winter Solstice to the depths of winter, all grows and diminishes imperceptibly, in accord with nature’s subtlety. If one were to force a sudden change after the Great Heat, it would violate the natural order. Hence the *Triple Unification* compares it to *“the depths of winter’s great dryness, the height of summer’s frost and snow”*—within this lies a wondrous principle.\n\nIn our practice, to lose the subtlety of “gradual” is to depart from the natural. What is unnatural is not the Dao. Charcoal burns hotter than firewood—this is common knowledge. Consider cooking meat: first, use charcoal to boil it vigorously; once done, switch to firewood to simmer it slowly, allowing the broth to reduce—then the meat is truly flavorful. There is no other reason: the firing process has reached perfection. The same applies to elixir refinement. Charcoal is the martial fire; firewood is the civil fire. Water and fire are the heart and breath. Use martial fire for wild combat, civil fire for guarding the city and nurturing—then the primordial great medicine will naturally be forged according to the method, like meat cooked to tenderness and pure flavor.\n\nBreath interdependent is martial fire; breathless absorption is civil fire. Absorption reaches the point of forgetting both inner and outer—this is the cessation of fire. Li Daochun’s commentary on the *Dao De Jing* surpasses those of Lu and Li. His skill in practice is excellent, and his writing is superb, hence he rises above all other schools. I once thought Feng Zunshi’s works were commendable in their external approach, but upon reading them, I found no firing process—now I have removed them (though they were previously included in the *Eastern Pavilion Essentials*). What use is a teaching without the firing process?\n\nLu Qianxu’s *Dao De Jing* contains five parts firing process and five parts imagery. Zhang Sanfeng’s *Essentials of the Mysterious* has six or seven parts firing process and three parts imagery. My *Essentials of the Mysterious* is purely the firing process, without a single image. I take others’ imagery and, through step-by-step explanation, transform it entirely into the firing process. Moreover, having read extensively in alchemical texts, I have compiled all the wondrous insights on the firing process from various schools into the *Essentials of the Mysterious*. Thus, this book truly surpasses all others—yet alas, people fail to recognize its worth, mistaking gold for copper. Only one person, surnamed Wang, has understood my work; I have no other true connoisseurs.\n\nFor over thirty years, I have delved into the root-source, fathoming the subtle workings of the void. I wish to speak plainly to those who understand, without concealment—hence these earnest words.\n\nSuch phrases as \"even a thread of attachment to the corporeal form\" being \"a hair’s breadth off, and the elixir fails\" are truths no predecessor has ever spoken. To those of discernment, these words are a delight to read; but to those clinging to forms, or those who fix their practice upon the physical body, they pass through the eyes and are dismissed as nothing. At this, the Master heaved a deep sigh.\n\nThe firing process arises from the interdependence of mind and breath. Were I to transmit to you the entire oral formula now, you would not comprehend it. Thus the ancients waited until a disciple had reached a certain stage before offering a single word of enlightenment—only then would the teaching take root, and both parties benefit. When the firing process is explained, it seems bland and insipid. The various elucidations of outsiders belong to the realm of post-celestial *gewu* (investigation of things), which is already formidable; our practice, however, belongs to the realm of pre-celestial *gewu*, which is even more so. The *Book of Changes* is the ancestral text of the Three Teachings; after receiving the formula, one must study it hundreds of times before the entire firing process can be fully grasped.\n\nWithout reading alchemical texts, the body can revert to youth in ten months—this is the Way of utmost simplicity and ease. Those who do not read find the practice easier, for they follow instructions without question. The interdependence of mind and breath is also spoken of in terms of imagery. As *Awakening to Reality* says: *\"Though one speaks of cinnabar and mercury, without knowing the firing process, it is all in vain.\"* Cinnabar and mercury are none other than mind and breath. You must first empty the mind; once the practice is mature, then interdependence follows. Simply by emptying the mind, one can prevent the leakage of essence. When the practice of emptying the mind is perfected, and one then turns to external interdependence, even if a single insight arises, it will follow the ebb and flow of breath—how then could stray thoughts arise?\n\nWu Chongxu said: *\"Before beginning practice, one must first cultivate stillness for a month.\"* Such crucial phrases must not be overlooked when reading. The ancients said: *\"Since ancient times, there have been six hundred firing records, each resembling the next in gathering true lead.\"* It is always the interdependence of mind and breath, though with variations—how could it be otherwise? Hence, *\"each resembling the next.\"*\n\nWhen first encountering a disciple, one must discuss alchemical texts to subdue their mind. If one were to immediately speak of wordlessness, the absence of the celestial cycle, or the irrelevance of the midnight-noon axis, how could they believe you? Zhang Sanfeng said: *\"Make self and other as stable as can be; make yin and yang as topsy-turvy as they may be—repelling demons depends entirely on the sword of wisdom.\"* These three lines are the first stage of practice, striking the very essence. The last line is especially crucial: if any vision arises, swiftly return to the interdependence of mind and breath. The next line—*\"Dare to pluck the blossoms blooming beyond the wall\"*—is the second stage of practice. When the practice is well-executed, nothing is subject to your control.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* says: *\"Stopping at the back, one does not perceive the body\"*—this is forgetting form. *\"Walking in the courtyard, one does not see the person\"*—this is forgetting others. When both self and other are forgotten, one enters the state of stillness in *Gen*. The reason we write books is that Master Wu once remarked: if one could compose a work that establishes a school of thought and transmits it to later generations for the benefit of all beings, it would be the greatest merit. Thus, I have labored tirelessly for thirty years to complete *The Mysterious Essentials of the Golden Elixir*. Alas, how much hardship it has cost me!\n\nIf Master Meng comes this summer, you must take a week’s leave and come to me. First, because I do not understand his language, and second, because Master Meng saved me in my time of need—all thanks to your letter. I am deeply grateful to you and wish to let you hear these secret essentials. In the future, if you meet Master Tang, you may tell him as well, so that I may transmit to three people. If I were to teach only one, it would exhaust my energy, and later there would be no one to verify or discuss with, which would also be inconvenient for you.\n\nLi Daochun’s practice was profound, which is why the final chapter of *The Pointers to the Nature and Life* still praises him. I was once instructed to read the poems of Ancestor Li. If you read *The Mysterious Essentials of the Golden Elixir* dozens or even a hundred times, enlightenment will surely dawn. But if you abandon it before ten readings, how can you penetrate its depths? The proverb says: *\"At the end of the mountain path and the river’s flow, one despairs of the way—then willows darken and flowers brighten to reveal another village.\"* This holds a profound mystery. In our practice, when we reach the state of primordial chaos and emptiness, the breath ceases as if in a small death—such is the experience.\n\nThe Master spoke of my sincerity and thus transmitted a starting point. When Master Meng came to Shanghai, we spoke only twice, and I did not even teach him the complete starting method.\n\n*The Kinship of the Three*, when it reached Zhu Yuanyu’s *Probing the Profound*, reached its utmost excellence. I said: \"One should only compose books after returning to the body of youth.\" The Master replied: \"That is not strictly necessary—one need only grasp the firing times.\" He continued: *The Scripture of Dao and Virtue*, when it reached Li Daochun’s *Convergence of Origins*, likewise reached its utmost excellence. Wang Yiqing, Lu Qianxu, and Li Hanxu—none could match them. Thus, their commentaries may be called peerlessly sublime. Lai Qutang’s words—*\"The cosmos has its own Changes\"* and *\"Not in the Four Sages but within myself\"*—all pertain to the subtleties of the firing times. Alas that you do not recognize this.\n\nIn expounding Lai Zhide’s *Circular Diagram of the Zhou Changes*, he said: *\"That which governs is principle\"*—this is what Laozi calls *\"the Nameless, the beginning of Heaven and Earth,\"* standing alone. *\"That which stands in relation is number\"*—this is *\"the Named, the mother of the myriad things,\"* which is the interdependence of mind and breath. *\"That which flows is qi\"*—this is the firing times. These three phrases are truly concise and wondrous.\n\nIf Meng Junruo could meet with me now and practice for several more months, he would be able to completely eliminate the medicinal water. The verse in *Awakening to Reality*—*\"Common sayings often align with the sagely Dao\"*—is truly excellent. It refers precisely to the firing times. For instance, the common phrase *\"heart and qi in harmony\"*—this is all that cultivation of the Dao requires. Thus, if one can turn inward to seek it, *\"the mountains and rivers of the great earth all become treasure.\"* Life and death are separated by but a single thread: following the current leads to death, reversing it leads to immortality. The principle is subtle and profound, unknown to the world. Hence, Shi Xinglin said: *\"The Great Dao lies right before your eyes.\"*\n\nThe *Baopuzi* contains countless discussions on the firing times, all of them astonishingly profound—what a pity you do not read it. \"Leaving the household\" is but a symbol. The body is the abode of spirit, and to grope about in the postnatal physical form is never the Great Dao. One must depart from this body and nurture it in the emptiness of space. When spirit leaves the physical form and stabilizes externally, this is true \"leaving the household.\" \"Entering the mountains\" is also a symbol. The mountain is the image of the *Gen* hexagram—*Gen* means cessation. When spirit stabilizes externally and body and mind are still and unmoving, this is \"entering the mountains.\" It is like the Yellow Emperor entering Kongtong and attaining the Dao. The ancients practiced the Dao as great recluses in the marketplace, and only after completing their great work and advancing to the highest spiritual cultivation would they enter the deep mountains. Never did they enter the mountains while worldly affairs remained unresolved or their practice was not yet two-thirds complete.\n\nThe Master further said: When practice reaches the great stabilization of the six senses, where one remains unmoved by external phenomena, utterly still and perpetually serene, this is true \"entering the mountains.\" Once the heart has entered the mountains, one may dwell in the marketplace. In the state of indistinct obscurity, emptiness, and primordial chaos—where form and things are forgotten, and stabilization occurs externally—the longer it endures, the more wondrous it becomes, the more spiritually potent. This is the gathering of primordial qi. As practice deepens and advances, one may eventually attain the Dao. The ancient immortals said: *\"A year or two of diligence brings a thousand aeons of bliss\"*—this is no exaggeration. The *Cantong Qi* compares it to *\"erecting a pole to see its shadow, calling into a valley to hear its echo.\"* This Dao is truly swift beyond all conception.\n\nThe Mysterious Female aperture is the most profound and wondrous—all methods of elixir refinement, even to the point of spiritual transformation and shedding the mortal coil, depend entirely on this aperture. As the saying goes: *\"Attain this one thing, and all matters are complete.\"* That I have grasped this technique is truly due to the accumulated virtue of my ancestors—how could it be easy?\n\nFrom *Wang Zu’s Record of True Teachings: Notes on the Essentials*—\n\nIn beginning one’s practice, one must first attain clarity and stillness. Clarity means purifying the heart; purifying the heart means emptying it. Stillness means calming the qi; calming the qi means harmonizing and balancing the breath. When stillness is achieved, the qi becomes harmonious. Then, just beyond the nostrils, apply a trace of awareness to perceive the movement of the breath. Place the heart externally, allowing no thoughts to arise, and all conditions will cease. In an instant, the qi will naturally become still.\n\nOnce the qi is tranquil, the natural in-and-out of the breath will become perceptible externally. This is using qi to seek spirit, not using spirit to seek qi. Using qi to seek spirit is most natural. The qi will naturally seek spirit without any need for your awareness. If you use spirit to seek qi, the qi will not desire the spirit, and the spirit will merely be the spirit of consciousness, not the original spirit. This is not the true union of husband and wife, not the true bellows, not the true crucible and furnace—it falls into the realm of postnatal intention.\n\nThus, counting the breaths is not the same as violently forcing the breath. If the spirit is not at ease, the body will not feel comfortable. This is a grave error. Once you perceive the faint in-and-out of the breath externally, simply follow its natural course and forget it. The act of preserving is not deliberate, nor is the act of forgetting. Both preservation and forgetting arise naturally, without the slightest exertion of force. Whether you sleep or remain awake, leave it to itself—I merely remain unattached, utterly muddled.\n\nIf there is the slightest sensation of softness, once perceived, immediately return to the external reliance. If there is the slightest movement, once perceived, likewise return to the external reliance. As stillness deepens, the breath gradually becomes finer, and the physical body gradually softens. In the midst of stillness, if you sense movement anywhere in the physical body, continue to rely externally. This must become a natural habit. Whenever there is any movement or stillness, large or small, within or without the physical body, as soon as you become aware of it, without any deliberate intention, naturally turn your entire heart to rely externally on the breath—this is excellent.\n\nThe softer the areas of the physical body become, the softer they grow. The finer the breath becomes, the finer it grows, until it ceases entirely, with no in-and-out. This is when spirit stabilizes in the external emptiness—this is the Celestial Heart. At this time, if the external yang stirs even the slightest bit, immediately return to the external union of heart and breath. For when spirit and qi have merged as one, stillness is one, and movement is one. When still, they are still together; when moving, they move together. Thus, when the external yang stirs, the spirit also knows. When the yang moves, the spirit also moves, and the qi shifts from stillness to movement. The mouth and nose immediately resume breathing, and I swiftly return externally to reunite spirit and qi.\n\nWhen the spirit perceives, the heart and qi separate and manifest through the mouth and nose. This is the unity of spirit and qi—when the spirit moves, the qi moves; when the spirit is still, the qi is still. Thus, the external yang naturally recedes without any need to manage it. Gradually, you return to softness and indistinctness, relying until stabilization is achieved. In stabilization, the external yang stirs again, and you once more rely externally.\n\nRelying thus, you gradually settle into stillness again. Practicing this day after day, you reach the point where, when the external yang arises, your intent does not stir, and the heart naturally turns outward to rely on the breath—this is mastery. For by this time, the spirit has grown perceptive; it naturally goes to rely without needing instruction. You need only embrace the word \"stability\" as your sovereign. Whether the Great Circulation or the Small Circulation, the moment the bodily form stirs the slightest awareness, you return externally to rely. The deeper the practice, the longer the stability. You must cultivate until, when yang stirs in stillness, it is as if you remain unaware—it arises on its own, while you abide in your stability, serene and unmoved as before. Then the Gate of Yang gradually closes. When, in stillness, the external yang no longer stirs in the slightest, the yin essence is fully transformed—this is called \"returning to youth.\"\n\nThe Ancestor said: The Great Dao is nothing more than the word \"stability.\" Yet \"stability\" is but a figurative term; it is truly the word \"forgetting.\" And \"forgetting\" is also figurative; it is truly the word \"sincerity.\" Thus *The Mirror of Entering the Elixir* states: \"Simply be utterly sincere, and the method arises naturally.\" This utter sincerity and naturalness—discussing its utmost subtlety—cannot be conveyed by speech or captured in writing. Therefore, I say: whatever can be set down in brush and ink is but the fish-trap and rabbit-snare, never the Dao itself. How could the world believe this?\n\nThe Ancestor said: Stability before yang arises, and stability again after yang arises—this stability is indispensable. The crux of the elixir method lies precisely in the work of true emptiness, which is nothing other than the word \"stability.\" With three hours of stability, once true emptiness is attained, you may advance further, extending the duration of true emptiness from short to long. Then the return to youth is no longer in question, and all effects manifest with the effortless ease of water flowing into a channel—the elixir method is already eighty or ninety percent complete.\n\nThe elixir method proceeds step by step by aligning with the Heavenly Heart, not the human heart. When the human heart acts, it differs from the Heavenly Heart. You must understand: the heart is one. If thoughts arise and vanish within the bodily form, alert and wandering, that is the human heart. Detached from the bodily form, abiding externally, silent yet ever-illuminating, thoughtless yet knowing—that is the Heavenly Heart. In sum, to be intentional and attached to form is the human heart in control; to be unintentional, detached from the bodily form, stabilized externally, forgetting yet empty and luminous, with qi flowing harmoniously—like moonlight penetrating water, visible yet insubstantial, reflecting without clinging, illuminating yet ever-empty—is the Heavenly Heart in control. This work must be cultivated.\n\nWhen refining essence, forget the form, and essence will not leak. When refining qi, forget qi, and qi will not leak. The firing process is most crucial. In the initial stage of refining essence, know that martial fire is used for decoction. When yang arises, apply one measure of martial fire—this is relying on the heart and breath externally. Then gradually shift from martial fire to civil fire—this is entering stability without breath. Civil fire is for gentle nurturing. From stability, shift into the realm of forgetting. Profound forgetting of inner and outer—this is ceasing the fire. Ceasing the fire means withdrawing and resting—this is the secret of sealing and securing.\n\nThe Master said: Relying on the breath is martial fire; breathless stability is civil fire; prolonged stability merging into forgetting is ceasing the fire. These three phrases suffice.\n\n**Postscript:** This discourse is the method of the Qing dynasty Ancestor Li Hanxu, transmitted to Wu Tianzhi, who then transmitted it to Wang Dongting. This is Wang Dongting’s record of questions and answers from the fifth to sixth years of the Republic, when he taught Xu Haiyin and other disciples, later compiled by Xu Haiyin. This copy was transcribed by Tianlezi Chen Yuzhao (a disciple of Cai Qiangu, who received the transmission from Wang Dongting) in 1980 (over 41,600 characters in total), though it is not the complete text. The complete text is now untraceable. Two appendices follow.\n\n**The Body-Realized Mountain Man Wang Dongting’s Oral Instructions on Female Alchemy, Volume One**\n\nThe study of nature and life is the same for men and women, without distinction. In sum, it hinges on the four characters: \"utmost sincerity, single-minded devotion.\" As the *Book of Documents* states: \"Only the utmost sincerity under heaven can effect transformation.\" The *Classic* says: \"Utter concentration in listening to the mandate.\" For beginners, the first and most crucial step is nothing other than refining the self. To refine the self is to make the heart and breath interdependent. Interdependence means the heart depends on the breath, and the breath likewise depends on the heart. Yet the most essential element is harmony. The *Canticle* says: \"In harmony, they follow one another,\" and again: \"Each attains its harmony.\" Harmony does not depart from the center, nor does the center depart from harmony. Are center and harmony one or two? When center and harmony unite, this is called the Yellow Dame. When the Yellow Dame harmonizes, naturally there arises mutual love, mutual longing, mutual swallowing, mutual exhaling—continuous and unbroken, neither forgetting nor forcing. Laozi said: \"Concentrate qi to attain suppleness—can you be like an infant?\" This is the perfection of true harmony. Yuchan said: \"When the old husband and wife meet again, affection lingers of itself.\" The *Classic* states: \"Knit into one mass, blended into one place, forged into one sheet, tempered in one furnace.\" And again: \"The Cowherd and Weaver Girl meet; yin and yang follow; crow and hare share a den; sun and moon share a palace; hun and po unite; metal and fire merge.\" In essence, this means spirit does not leave qi, nor qi leave spirit—equivalently, the heart does not leave the breath, nor the breath leave the heart.\n\nNow, spirit is nature, and qi is life. The *Classic* says: \"The root of nature lies in the heart; the stem of life lies in the breath.\" One must know that only when the two unite is creation accomplished. For when the two unite, the Two Modes return to the One Supreme Polarity. This is called the dual cultivation of nature and life. Dual cultivation of nature and life simply teaches one to make the heart and breath interdependent, never parting for even a moment. Thus, Ancestor Bai said: \"Refining the medicine with fire to form the elixir is none other than using spirit to guide qi to attain the Dao.\"\n\nIn daily practice, one must hold the heart to the breath and the breath to the heart. After a short while, when evenness is achieved, natural great stability arises, directly entering the dim and distant, the indistinct and vague—without heaven, without earth, forgetting things, forgetting form. The *Canticle* says: \"The eldest son inherits the father’s body, and by the mother establishes the foundation.\" And again: \"Know the white, guard the black, and spiritual illumination will come of itself.\" This is precisely the moment.\n\nOne feels the body and mind soften and revive, extraordinarily refreshed—just as Zhang Sanfeng said: *\"Like a mute tasting honey, it cannot be described.\"* Master Shao put it: *\"In the dim and vague, yin and yang first transform; / In the swirling mist, heaven and earth begin their dance. / Amidst this fleeting wondrous scene, / How could mere words capture the work?\"* The *Canticle* states: *\"Golden sand enters the five viscera, / Dispersing like wind and rain. / Steaming and permeating the four limbs, / The complexion glows with radiant beauty.\"* For at this moment, the primordial qi emerges from the midst of emptiness and nothingness. Master Shao said: *\"At midnight of the winter solstice, / The heart of heaven remains unchanged. / Where the first yang stirs, / All things are yet unborn.\"* This is what the alchemical texts call the *living midnight hour*, what Master Ziyang termed *\"When gui arises, swiftly gather it,\"* and what Master Shangyang described as: *\"What is gathering? It is gathering with the ungathering gather. / What is the ungathering gather? It is rending asunder the primal chaos.\"*\n\nI explain: *\"What is rending asunder the primal chaos? It is the moment of utmost emptiness and profound stillness.\"* For when one attains emptiness to its extreme and guards stillness to its depth, this is returning to Kun. Now Kun is the southwest, the land where the medicine is born, the realm of chaos, the gateway of the Mysterious Female. Master Miao Xi said: *\"To seek the true seed of the primordial, / One must root it in the midst of chaos.\"* Ah! Once the foundation is established and the Valley Spirit never dies, how could a person ever perish?\n\nThe above concerns refining the self and laying the foundation, gathering the great medicine of the primordial—whether for men or women, the practice is no different. Thus it is said: *\"The Great Dao makes no distinction between man and woman; / Yin and yang, the Five Phases are all the same.\"* What follows speaks of the differences in the postcelestial.\n\nMaster Liu Wuyuan’s alchemical instructions state: *\"There is but one true oral formula at the outset— / Yet their methods diverge as heaven from the abyss. / The sun refines qi for men; / The moon refines form for women, like a snare for the hare.\"* For man is yang, and his number is odd. As the Classic says: *\"Heaven One generates water\"*—man embodies this, so he begins at the Kun Palace, one *cun* and three *fen* below the navel. Woman is yin, and her number is even. As the Classic says: *\"Earth Two generates fire\"*—woman embodies this, so she works at the Li position between the two breasts. This is an unchanging principle. What medical texts call the *\"breast stream\"* and alchemical texts call the *\"breast chamber\"* refers to this very aperture.\n\nOf old, Master Lü taught the Immortal Zhang with these words: *\"Kan and Li, Zhen and Dui divide midnight and noon— / You must recognize your own ancestral origin. / Like thunder shaking the mountain, rain falls; / Wait to wash clean the yellow sprout as it emerges from the earth. / Seize the golden essence and firmly seal it; / Refine geng and jia to give birth to dragon and tiger. / When they ask who transmitted this to you, / Simply say the master’s surname is Lü.\"* For one must refine the self to perfection before gaining mastery. And one must daily steal the yang of heaven and earth, constantly steaming and bathing in it, before seeing any effect. Whether one or two months, or three or four, the duration depends on the depth of the practitioner’s effort.\n\nAt times during practice, one may suddenly feel qi surge from the aperture, splitting into two paths that rush straight to the breasts, filling the nipples until they stand firm—this is what the alchemical texts call the *living midnight hour* when the medicine is born. Master Shao said: *\"Suddenly at midnight, a single thunderclap— / A thousand doors and ten thousand gates open in succession. / If you recognize the image hidden within the imageless, / You may meet Fuxi in person.\"* At this stage, the hundred vessels harmonize, all gates and apertures open, and truly *\"one’s whole being brims with spring.\"*\n\nNow the period between midnight and noon is what is meant by *\"Between hai and zi, one obtains the most genuine.\"* *\"Regulating the breath\"* means harmonizing the breath evenly. *\"Sitting\"* refers to the two (yin and yang) dividing left and right, like generals leading their armies. *\"A single earth stands at the center\"*—only because both hold the true earth within. When the true earth returns to the center, qi flows unimpeded, thus directly connecting to the Jiaji Pass. *\"Passing through Kunlun\"* is precisely reversing the flow of the Yellow River. At this time, one feels the strength of qi and thinks of *\"I\"*—*\"I\"* being a metaphor for the pure yang qi. It also means that *\"I\"* have refined the Golden Immortal of the Great One, the Great One containing the true qi.\n\n*\"Kan and Li, Zhen and Dui divide midnight and noon\"*—first establish the four cardinal positions of Kan, Li, Zhen, and Dui, then distinguish the four seasons of zi, wu, mao, and you. *\"Recognize your own ancestral origin\"* means tracing back to the moment of conception, the first reception of qi, and recognizing the primordial ancestral qi. *\"Washing\"* refers to bathing and purifying the heart, refining the self through steaming. *\"Yellow\"* is the color of earth; *\"sprout\"* is the mechanism of life. *\"Emerging from the earth\"* is a metaphor for the renewal of all things in spring, when mountains and rivers are made anew. For this yang qi connects to heaven, blazing like fire, swift as a whirlwind—one must swiftly gather it and send it into the Central Palace, hence: *\"Seize the golden essence and firmly seal it.\"* Zhang Sanfeng said: *\"Seize the golden essence and carefully guide it, / Send it into the Cinnabar Field.\"*\n\n*\"Refine jia and geng to give birth to dragon and tiger\"* means that geng must be born, jia must be born—only then does the path of jia and geng begin to sprout. *\"When they ask who transmitted this to you, / Simply say the master’s surname is Lü.\"* For *\"Lü\"* implies *\"mouth to mouth, aperture to aperture\"*—the heart-to-heart transmission, the oral transmission of the golden elixir’s wondrous formula. In sum, it teaches one to draw fire to press the metal, circulate it through the Microcosmic Orbit, and harmonize the qi of the dragon and tiger, the ascent and descent of yin and yang.\n\nIf one’s effort is diligent, as Ancestor Zhang Sanfeng said: *\"Wait until that single point naturally submits— / Within the body, it transforms into the four seasons of spring. / A wisp of white cloud, a waft of fragrance; / After each rain, everything is renewed.\"*\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"All day in a stupor like a drunkard,\nLeisurely guarding only the spring within the cave.\nWhen the yin essence throughout the body is wholly stripped away,\nIt transforms into a single mass of pure yang gold.\"*\n\nFrom this point onward, the work is the same as that for men. Now, among the formulas for the elixir of female adepts, this verse alone is the swiftest path. Ancestor Lü, disdaining worldly treasures, spoke it all in a single breath—yet how few recognize its value! I now explain it clearly: the \"one *cun* and three *fen* below the navel\" and the \"cavity between the two breasts\" are both figurative expressions—one must never seek them in physical form. As the classic states: *\"Clinging to this body is not the Dao, / Yet departing from this body is also in error.\"* It also says: *\"Within and without this body, all is yin,\"* and again: *\"Gazing before your eyes, you fail to recognize the true.\"* Moreover, the layers and fire-phases within are subtle and refined; only through the oral transmission and heart-to-heart instruction of a true master, grasped with intuitive insight, can one find a place to begin.\n\nMaster Shangyang said: *\"How can oral instructions be made clear on paper? / Take care not to force guesses or grope blindly, lest you mislead yourself.\"*\n\nIn the autumn of the *jihai* year of the Guangxu reign (1899), while residing in Shanghai, I heard of Lady Cao of the Li family from Sanshui County, Guangdong—chaste and pure, learned and knowledgeable, surpassing many men. When we met, we discussed the elixir texts, and she proved no empty reputation. Delighted, I said: *\"Great talents and great scholars in this world all disregard their lives—why should Lady Li alone be so sincere?\"* Thus I compose this piece to present to her. *(Excerpted from The Great Compendium of the Daoist Transmission)*\n\nWang Dongting’s Discourse on *The Song of the Great Dao of the Numinous Source*\n\nWang Dongting said: *The Song of the Great Dao* is also attributed to Patriarch Liu Haichan, titled *The Song of Utmost Reality*. In my judgment, however, upon examining the elixir texts of past dynasties, all works composed by female adepts speak only of mercury and not of lead, only of water and not of fire. This is because the female adept’s body belongs to the *kun* (earthly) constitution, making it improper to speak of yang fire, and thus only the *yin tally* is discussed.\n\nThis song alone is entirely purged of such references, with not a single word touching upon lead—all it speaks of is true mercury. Moreover, the *Numinous Source* (灵源), as the classics state, is the *spring cavern* (泉窟), which is the root of *spirit-water* (神水). The *Song* says: *“Spirit-water is hard to describe; few recognize it,”* and again: *“Moved by heat, moved by sorrow, moved by thought, moved by wind, / It flows and turns, moistening the whole body, / Yet in the end, it never departs from spirit-water.”* These lines echo *Awakening to Reality*: *“Originally it is but a single taste of mercury, / Circulating through all the celestial bodies; / When yin and yang’s numbers are complete, it naturally becomes spirit— / Entering and exiting without leaving the Mysterious Female.”* For the Mysterious Female is none other than the *Numinous Source*, the spring cavern.\n\nAs for *Utmost Reality* (至真), the classics define it as *utmost yang*. Yet this song speaks solely of true yin—what connection does it have with the term *Utmost Reality*? I assert without doubt that this work was composed by the Immortal Maiden Wen Yixian. Furthermore, Patriarch Liu’s *Returning Gold Treatise* and *The Song of the Returned Elixir* both treat lead and mercury as counterparts—why would this song alone speak of mercury without mentioning lead?\n\nSome may ask: *Is this not solitary yin?* I reply: The Perfected Li’s commentary on the *Scripture of Yin Conformity* states: *“The yin tally refers to yang fire,”* and again: *“To speak of the yin tally is to speak of yang fire within it.”* When one probes the ultimate reality, there is but a single *nothingness* before the union of father and mother—what the sages forcibly depict as the *Wuji* (Ultimate Void), also described as *“invisible, inaudible, untouchable, and beyond inquiry.”*\n\nAlas! The myriad volumes of elixir texts, with their varied and divergent expressions, are but metaphorical speech.\n\nOn paper, mere surface and fur; in the air, towers and pavilions—without meeting a true master, where does one even begin?

      "translated_text": "**The True Oral Instructions of Master Tizhen**\n\nRecorded by Wang Dongting, transcribed by Xuan Yin Waishi, a disciple from western Zhejiang.\n\nFor the preservation and nurturing of the body, one must prioritize the cultivation of spirit and the nourishment of qi. This is akin to planting a tree—one must first tend to its roots. Spirit and qi are the very foundation of our body. As the *Canon* states: *\"To manage and nourish the foundation, concentrate the spirit to form the body.\"* This foundation is the root of life.\n\nThe method of nurturing lies solely in gathering one’s spirit into the qi cavity. At present, your eyes are reddened, indicating heart-fire flaring upward, while below, essence leaks downward, signifying kidney-water draining away—both heart and kidney have been disturbed. If the lungs are further agitated, coughing will ensue, and consumption will take hold. Upon returning, you must apply yourself with utmost diligence, committing wholeheartedly to rigorous practice to achieve profound effects. Once the oral instructions are received, from this day forward, you will be able to prevent essence from leaking.\n\nDuring practice, if stray thoughts arise, do not be troubled. Know that stray thoughts are like falling leaves, while the union of mind and breath is an iron broom—sweeping as they fall, there will come a day when all is swept clean. There must be no beginning and no end; the longer the concentration, the more the acquired spirit submits, and the more the original spirit manifests.\n\nAvoid alcohol entirely—remember this well, for it disrupts one’s nature. *\"Illuminating virtue\"* is the single qi within emptiness, represented by the yang line (|). *\"Utmost goodness\"* is the void, represented by the yin circle (〇). *\"Resting in utmost goodness\"* is the union of yin and yang (〇|), the state of mind and breath in harmony.\n\nThe term *\"casting off the mortal coil\"* refers to shedding the ordinary breath of the mundane body, thereby transforming the acquired spirit of later heaven. When the work reaches fruition, the entire body becomes supple and soft, and the true yang of prior heaven enters. For every degree of yang that enters, a degree of yin retreats. Hence, the alchemical texts speak of *\"advancing the yang fire and retreating the yin tally.\"*\n\nWhen ordinary breathing ceases and spirit and qi settle into great stillness, this is the gentle fire of *\"bathing and nurturing.\"* When one reaches the state of primordial chaos, this is the union of heaven and earth. I asked what this meant, and the Master replied: When both body and mind are utterly still, your physical form is like the earth, which pertains to *kun*; the heavens outside pertain to *qian*. When the true qi of *qian*-yang from without reaches your body without obstruction, is this not the union of heaven and earth?\n\nWhen stillness reaches its extreme and movement arises, yang is born within the body, the yang-qi surges upward, and true fluid descends—this is the union of *kan* and *li*. The union of *kan* and *li* belongs to later heaven, while the union of *qian* and *kun* belongs to prior heaven. The union of *qian* and *kun* occurs externally, while the union of *kan* and *li* occurs internally. The union of *qian* and *kun* precedes that of *kan* and *li*.\n\nThe microcosmic orbit within the body must be cultivated to resemble Fuxi’s circular diagram, with nothing lacking and nothing in excess. *\"White clouds ascend to the upper palace\"* signifies qi surging upward. *\"Sweet dew sprinkles Mount Sumeru\"* signifies qi descending. As it is said: *\"Drizzling like spring rain, flowing like melting ice. From the head it streams to the feet, then ultimately ascends again.\"*\n\nThe true crucible and furnace are the union of mind and breath, which must be placed externally—if attached to the physical body, it is not genuine. A single void is independent, while the two of yin and yang are interdependent. That is all.\n\nFor those whose bodies are broken, the entire body above and below is yin, thus requiring the summoning of the true yang of the void to sustain life. When mind and breath unite in great stillness, the void of heaven and earth becomes one’s own void, and the true yang within the void naturally flows in unceasingly—how could one not attain longevity?\n\nThere will certainly be variations in duration. When the work is mastered, the entire body feels at ease, extending to three or four hours, reaching the macrocosmic orbit. If one can remain in stillness externally for a prolonged period, at the extreme of stillness, one can depart from stillness and project the spirit.\n\nThe method of learning immortality is nothing more than concentration. For every degree of concentration achieved, a degree of breathing is relinquished; for every degree of breathing relinquished, a degree of yin is removed; for every degree of yin removed, a degree of yang is added; for every degree of yang added, the original spirit gains a degree of clarity. As clarity increases, the spirit becomes more vigorous. When the spirit is complete, one naturally casts off the mortal coil.\n\nThe alchemical texts speak endlessly, yet all revolve around the union of mind and breath. Thus it is said: *\"A few words, not many characters—ten thousand volumes of immortal scriptures distilled into one phrase.\"*\n\nFrom the moment you rely on it, you can enter concentration. After three to five breaths, you enter concentration—at the very least, half a year of unwavering effort is required. From concentrating for two to three minutes to one or two hours, at least two years of unwavering effort are needed.\n\nIf there is a diseased area, when the true yang of heaven and earth arrives, that area will not become supple and soft. You must apply effort until it does, and the illness will be dispelled.\n\nThe study of the Dao begins with returning from later heaven to prior heaven, then from prior heaven to that which precedes prior heaven—only then is it called the Great Dao.\n\nAfter achieving concentration through the union of mind and breath, the mind and breath no longer require concentration to attain great stillness. In great stillness, one remains in great stillness; at the extreme of stillness, one can depart from stillness. Departing from stillness without clinging to departure is the projection of the spirit. Thus it is said: *\"To cross the river, one needs a raft; upon reaching the shore, the boat is no longer needed.\"*\n\nThe heart is but one—with thoughts, it is the human heart; without thoughts, it is the Dao-heart. Thus, in a single turn of thought, the Red Child becomes Sudhana the Youth, and the Bull Demon King returns to true awakening. It is merely a turning of the mind.\n\nThe Master said: *\"Turning the mind\"* means returning and reversing. Returning to my emptiness, restoring my nothingness—then the human heart returns to the Dao-heart. What difficulty is there?\n\nThe *\"tai\"* in *Taiji* refers to the one line, hence *Taiji* is represented by ⊙, while *Wuji* is represented by 〇.",

      "translated_text": "Reversing Kan and Li is but the interdependence of heart and breath. The mutual overcoming of the Five Phases—water and fire in harmonious balance—all such forced designations need not be remembered. It is merely the interdependence of heart and breath. Intentional yet unintentional, this is called true intent. The fire-tending is subtle; I cannot transmit it to you now. When you have attained it, I will show you the minor celestial cycle. You must live with me to receive it. The cessation of fire is the same. You must reach the point where you can eat a little food with each meal, for when qi is full, one loses the desire to eat. Cunning intent is the most harmful thing. Project the spirit into the qi, without a trace of cunning intent—this is the method of beginning practice. Before seven days had passed, she said: \"My whole body is supple and blissful.\" I asked her: \"Are your breasts firm?\" She replied: \"My breasts are firm; yang has arisen.\"\n\nFor women without menstruation, practice must first restore it; then, from having menstruation, return to its absence—this is the reversion to the child-body. Expounding the *\"Mysterious Essentials: The Heavenly Mechanism of the One Secret\"*, the Master said: \"I tell you the true oral transmission (this means transmitting to you the empty space of one move—heart and breath interdependent externally), I point to the moon at the edge of the sky (this refers to true yang about to arise, like the moon on the third day). When the moon is full, the jade bud blooms (speaking of stillness reaching its extreme and generating movement, the primordial qi emerging from emptiness).\" One must swiftly gather it. Thus, \"moon full\" means the moon is complete, signifying that qi is abundant and the source is utterly pure.\n\nIf the heart is not settled, one may use the gradual method to remedy it. Fix the gaze on a single word or object without shifting; then the spirit remains external and cannot generate stray thoughts. When the heart is constantly external, stillness is achieved. The Master said: \"When body and heart are both still, one must not cling to the physical form—only then is it the primordial Dao. Place your spirit outside the body, interdependent with the breath; then spirit congeals and qi harmonizes, and body and heart become still. Without speaking of heart and breath interdependence, I transmit to her a method of beginning practice. Each day in meditation, follow Master Wu’s method: place the spirit outside, interdependent with the breath. After two months, her whole body became supple and blissful, though she knew not why. Later, she understood it was the effect of spirit and qi interdependent externally. When the spirit is placed in the external qi, it congeals; when spirit congeals, qi also congeals. Only then did she realize Master Wu’s method was truly profound.\n\nIn your practice, do not cling to the physical form in the slightest. When yang arises, swiftly move outward—this ensures nothing will go amiss. He also said: \"Simply place the spirit outside and practice; faintly perceive the breath’s ingress and egress—that is all.\" During practice, if the body trembles, it is good, but do not fixate on it or cling to it. He further said: \"When you feel trembling, move outward.\"\n\nThe *\"Book of Transformations\"* considers the chapter *\"Dao-Heart\"* most important, stating: *\"Forget the form to nourish qi; forget qi to nourish spirit; forget spirit to nourish emptiness.\"* These three stages of practice are unified by the word *\"forget.\"* Such teaching is unique in the alchemical texts. Forgetting is the state of samadhi. The purer the forgetting, the longer the samadhi. The longer the samadhi, the more the ordinary breath is transformed. The more the ordinary breath is transformed, the more the spirit becomes whole. When the spirit is whole, the embryo in samadhi becomes complete and the spirit emerges. Thus, the *\"Great Cavern Scripture\"* says: *\"Great samadhi perfects the true.\"*\n\nThe beginning and end of Dao cultivation are nothing more than transcending this single breath. Without breath, essence and life are entirely within my grasp, not governed by emptiness but by me—not by Heaven. Yet this single breath is not easily transcended. Thus, the methods of the major and minor celestial cycles are but expedient means to eliminate this breath. Without such methods, samadhi cannot be prolonged. As long as a trace of breath remains, the treasure of life is not yet one’s own. Therefore, one must strive to remain in samadhi every moment of the twelve hours, without the slightest breath of ingress or egress—this is the sign of the embryo’s completion, and emergence from samadhi is not far off. Emergence of the spirit is the primordial spirit leaving samadhi, moving freely.\n\nThe Way of the Golden Elixir is simply the method of the dead heart. When the heart dies, the spirit lives. Know that what dies is the human heart, the discriminating spirit. What lives is the primordial spirit, the Dao-heart. The so-called reversion to youth is the reversion of the discriminating spirit to the primordial spirit of non-knowing and non-awareness. Abiding thus, unmoving and quiescent, constantly clear and still—like a child of two or three—one will not die.\n\nHe also said: \"Reverting to the child-body, you must understand it is the dharma-body reverting to the child-body. Vague and unknowing, like an infant before speech. After practicing the major celestial cycle, this effect is achieved, enabling one to live for hundreds or thousands of years, while the physical body naturally becomes youthful and strong. The method of the dead heart is nothing more than samadhi. The longer the samadhi, the deeper the mystery. The discriminating spirit is increasingly subdued, and the primordial spirit increasingly flourishes. Eventually, the discriminating spirit is entirely transformed, the primordial spirit fully restored, and breath ceases—this is great samadhi. The day great samadhi is attained is the day the primordial spirit is fully restored, and the embryo is complete.\n\nAll major and minor celestial cycles are but expedient means to deaden the heart. Without circulating qi through the body’s microcosmic orbit, primordial qi is not restored. Without primordial qi, samadhi is not prolonged. Without prolonged samadhi, breath is not eliminated. Without eliminating breath, a trace of yin is not removed. If yin is not removed, yang is not complete.\"",

      "translated_text": "Once stabilized, my Dharmakāya merges with the void, and the emptiness of heaven and earth fuses with the emptiness within me, extending to the emptiness of the Dharmadhātu. Void interpenetrates void, coalescing into one. Utterly undifferentiated, without beginning or end—how could one not attain longevity?\n\nThe Master further said: If you can stabilize for a single moment, your true master abides in the outer emptiness, nurturing for that moment, while your foul skin-bag becomes an empty dwelling. The true yang of heaven and earth then gathers ever more abundantly upon your physical form. As your primordial spirit is nourished by the primordial qi in the outer void, and your physical body is steeped and bathed in true yang, both body and mind are cultivated—this is called \"dual cultivation.\" Thus does one attain longevity. Dual cultivation means nurturing both within and without; these are two distinct matters. The more empty you become externally, the more true yang flows into your physical form—this moment is of immeasurable significance.\n\nYour consciousness, ever stirring within the body, conjures lustful thoughts and disturbs the sovereign heart. Therefore, the first step in Daoist practice is to expel it beyond the body and sustain it in the void. Once banished, the heart becomes empty; with the heart empty, the body becomes void, and the primordial yang-qi can then enter your form. In essence, it is the boundless primordial qi of heaven and earth that sustains this limited bodily frame. Steal day by day, pilfer moment by moment, and your body will naturally refine into pure yang—whether to become an immortal or a buddha rests entirely with you.\n\nThere is no such thing as fate in heaven and earth; if one fares poorly, it is merely attributed to fate. The Master further said: Gain and loss lie entirely with the individual—heaven and earth are impartial and selfless. For now, you must learn to seize the treasure of life. If you can enter the state of reverie within three to five breaths or seven to eight inhalations, no illness will dare assail you. This is what it means to seize the treasure of life.\n\nReverie and profound obscurity arise from the union of heart and breath; stabilization emerges from reverie and profound obscurity. The key to Daoist practice lies in \"perseverance and duration\"—neither can be lacking. The Master further said: Progress depends entirely on diligence; without diligence, one remains idle. Sincerity, silence, and softness are the essential principles of practice.\n\nThe Dao does not demand emptiness, yet emptiness naturally gravitates toward it. I do not seek to steal true yang, yet true yang comes of its own accord. Thus it is said: \"Gather with the gathering that does not gather; take with the taking that does not take.\" Laozi said: \"To seize, one must first give.\" How profound!\n\nThe Master further said: I do not strive to return to a childlike state, yet when the practice matures, one naturally reverts to it. That which is unknown in its workings is called \"prior to heaven.\" In short, it all depends on external application. Once the external practice is perfected, the physical body immediately yields results. Mastery arises from familiarity; the entire practice hinges on pure refinement.\n\nThe first through ninth sections of *Xingming Guizhi* expound on the principles of nature, blending the Three Teachings into one. The Master further said: The second section, *Anshen Zuqiao*, discusses the practice of life cultivation.\n\nAt that time, Master Wu told me: *Xingming Guizhi* is exceptionally well-written and worth studying. Read *Journey to the West* thoroughly, and all the details of fire-phasing practice will become clear—it is a truly extraordinary Daoist text. Master Wu also said: If you wish to read, studying *Journey to the West* alone will suffice.\n\nHe further said: \"Wukong\" means awakening to true emptiness. \"Wu-zhen\" means awakening to the true yang within true emptiness. Only by attaining utmost emptiness can one align with the non-empty virtue—this is the essence of awakening to truth.\n\nMaster Wu explained the two lines by Wu Chongxu: \"Aware yet unaware, reawakening to the primordial.\" Some texts write \"true mystery\" (*zhenxuan*), others \"true origin\" (*zhenyuan*)—which do you think is correct? I replied: \"Xuan.\" The Master said: No, it should be \"yuan.\" I asked why. He said: \"Yuan\" means emptiness.\n\nI earnestly requested an explanation of these two lines. The Master smiled and said: You explain it to me first. I said: I cannot. He smiled again and said: Try. I replied: In the full context, \"aware yet unaware\" means that when yang first arises, it is too tender to be gathered immediately. \"Reawakening to the primordial\" means that when yang is at its peak, one should seize it without delay. The Master said: Then the term \"true origin\" is unnecessary. I said: \"True origin\" refers to yang-qi. The Master said: That is how all alchemical texts explain it—you’ve merely read it in books. I said: Even Chongxu himself explained it this way, as did Liu Huayang. Even in your own *Xingming Yaozhi*, you explained it thus—how can it be wrong? The Master said: I’ve told you before—do not trust alchemical texts entirely. These two lines are just child’s play.\n\nAfter repeated inquiries, he finally said: Let me explain.",

As for *bu jue* 'unawareness,' when the primordial chaos is about to divide, if there is any movement, it is precisely the state of *huanghu yaoming* (indistinct and obscure), the functioning of the primordial. This 'awareness within unawareness' is true awareness. If one arises in great luminous awareness, one has already fallen into the postnatal—this is not the awareness of the primordial *huanghu* state.\n\nI have already instructed you: when you are muddled and confused, that is it.\n\nAs for *fu* 'reawakening,' you must further know that when yang arises below, only then are both yin and yang complete. Thus, the preceding line speaks of the living noon hour, while the following line speaks of the living midnight hour. If you cling to awareness the moment you become aware, you still do not know that yang is arising below. If yang does not arise, there is yin but no yang—therefore, you must have two awakenings. When you are in quiescent concentration and become vaguely aware, you need only recognize that yang is arising below, then swiftly extend it outward to where heart and breath interdepend. This is called the 'true origin,' represented by the circle 〇. The outward movement is what is meant by 'sending it back to the earthen cauldron, sealing it firmly.'\n\nI observe that in recent times, when practitioners reach the point of yang arising, they often err by being too hasty, having only one awareness and not two. They may happen to recognize it once, then rush outward to interdependence, yet still do not truly know that yang is arising below. This results in having mercury but no lead, yin but no yang—how can this succeed?\n\nThe Master said: I would not explain this unless you had reached this stage. Today, I have told you again—now do you understand? When yang arises, proceed according to the method. In short, the moment you become aware, you need only recognize that yang is arising below. Though there are two awakenings, in reality there is only one—'mercury and lead arise in the same place.' If you wish to speak of principle, then there is a distinction between two awakenings. But if, at that moment of recognition, you immediately proceed to the place of the true origin outside, what distinction of two awakenings remains? However, because scholars err by being too hasty—knowing only mercury and not lead—I speak of it in this way. Once this single point is clear, when the time comes for union, yin and yang will naturally be complete. If I did not explain this to you, you would not realize it on your own.\n\nI said: Without a master’s clarification, the fire phases of the golden elixir are truly difficult to comprehend on one’s own. When we previously reached the point of yang arising, Master Wu instructed me to wait until yang arose, then swiftly proceed outward. Be quick, he said—for if you delay even slightly, it becomes postnatal and unusable. I took his word for speed to heart: every time yang stirred, I immediately rushed outward, fearing attachment to the body. I pulled desperately in the void, pulling well, and yang would invert after seven or eight breaths; pulling poorly, even after dozens of breaths, the external yang would not invert.\n\nThe Master laughed and said: Without awakening, how could you possibly succeed? That is why, at the time, whenever I practiced, I would feel discomfort in that very place, and Master Wu would correct me.\n\nThe Master said: Without following a master’s instructions, success is utterly impossible. Errors must be corrected on the spot.\"",

      "translated_text": "The term \"Small Heavenly Circuit\" (小周天) actually originated in Daoist texts from the Yuan and Ming dynasties; it did not exist prior to the Tang and Song. Wu Chongxu later expanded upon it greatly, introducing concepts such as the \"minor medicine\" and \"major medicine.\" Zhang Xuqing’s writings are commendable, as he begins by discussing the void from the very outset. In the study of the Dao, if one can \"kill life,\" that alone would suffice. These two characters, \"killing life,\" encompass the entire elixir formula.\n\nPure Yang Ancestor said: \"Having been born, kill life; before dying, learn death—then you attain longevity.\" Learning death is precisely what \"killing life\" means. If one can kill life, one can attain longevity. I asked what \"killing life\" meant. The Master replied: Abandon this physical form, fix your awareness outside, and cling not even slightly—this is killing life. Killing life is the death of the heart-mind. When the heart-mind dies, the spirit lives. Great death brings great life. Yet to die to the heart-mind, one must first abandon the body. Forget things, forget form, enter profound and enduring stillness—stillness so deep that not even a wisp of breath remains, where inner and outer senses and their objects are all stilled. This is the art of dying to the heart-mind.\n\nThe myriad volumes of elixir scriptures all speak of nothing but abandoning the body and forgetting form. If you can truly discard this foul skin-bag and become utterly selfless, you will attain the Dao. The key is to forget things and forget form, to be empty and natural. At the outset of practice, you may faintly perceive its ebb and flow, but you must place it in the void outside, allowing not even a thread of attachment to the mouth or nose. If you can rely on this for even a moment, you will naturally forget breath; once breath is forgotten, let it be as it will.\n\nThe Master said: At first, you must apply some intention, but after a day or two, you should no longer need to use intention—it will naturally follow. With time, it becomes effortless, and no intention is required. Stillness alone will make it follow. Advancing further, you enter the state of indistinct obscurity. When you sleep at night, what you obtain is true yin, the true yin of Heaven and Earth—not true yang. Consider this: the vitality you use throughout the next day is inexhaustible, for true yin has already proven its great efficacy. How much more so when both body and heart-mind are still, drawing in the two numinous substances of Heaven and Earth’s true yin and true yang? How could this not extend life and enhance longevity?\n\nHe also said: When both body and heart-mind are still, sleeping at night brings bodily stillness. With bodily stillness, one can draw in Heaven and Earth’s true yin, which serves as postnatal mercury, becoming the vitality for the following day. When it is exhausted, fatigue returns, and one must sleep again. When sleep reaches profound stillness, true yin is once more drawn into the body. Thus, activity by day and stillness by night. Between movement and rest, one’s vitality is regulated, allowing work to continue without cease.\n\nWhen people grow weary, they often say they need rest. But where do they go to rest? Sitting in a chair or lying on a couch is merely resting the body, not true rest. True rest refers to the spirit and qi. When the spirit labors, the body tires, so the spirit must be placed within qi to rest. When the spirit is nourished by qi and qi is harmonized by the spirit, both spirit and qi become still. Placing them outside the body—this is true rest. Spirit and qi are a devoted couple; when they daily enter the state of indistinct obscurity, I preserve the Great Ultimate and extend my life.\n\nThe world does not understand what the two characters \"clarity and stillness\" mean, yet they go off to practice stillness techniques. Little do they know that \"clarity and stillness\" are the two characters for \"dual cultivation.\" Clarity means clarifying the heart-mind; stillness means stilling qi. When the heart-spirit is placed outside the body, the heart-mind becomes clear and qi becomes still. Heart-mind and breath must rely on each other, existing in the space between intention and non-intention. The greatest danger is clinging without transformation, becoming attached and igniting the fire.\n\nMencius said: \"Neither forget nor assist\"—these four characters perfectly capture the subtlety of breath regulation. When spirit and breath rely on each other and reach equilibrium, this is \"neither forgetting nor assisting.\" Once this state is attained, breath naturally becomes harmonious, and the spirit naturally enters the state of indistinct obscurity. This is the initial step in mastering the art of reliance. When the work of reliance becomes pure and refined, it must transition into the forgetting of spirit and qi before one can enter samadhi. If one cannot forget spirit and qi, one cannot enter samadhi. Thus, this character \"forgetting\" is of utmost importance.\n\nSleep is the first verification of reliance. But if heart-mind and breath cannot both be forgotten, one cannot sleep. If one cannot even sleep, how can one attain samadhi? This method of heart-mind and breath relying on each other is the fruit of true cultivation, a personal attainment. It is truly a treasure beyond price, not to be taken lightly. Many ancients sought the Dao and teachers their entire lives without success.\n\nCommenting on the *Book of Changes* passage: \"Qian is easy to know, Kun is simple in its ability; through ease and simplicity, the principles of the world are attained,\" the Master said: It is merely the harmonious fusion of heart-mind and breath. I say: \"Heart-mind and breath relying on each other outside\"—these seven characters. Master Wu said: To have heart-mind and breath rely on each other outside, and to do so until it dies without becoming an obstacle—this is an even more advanced instruction.\n\nZhang Ziyang said: \"Thus, the method of the Great Elixir is most simple and easy. Even the dullest of men, if they obtain and practice it, will immediately transcend to the realm of the sages. Therefore, Heaven guards its secrecy and does not permit its careless transmission to the unworthy.\" Stone Apricot Grove’s *Returning to the Origin* preface states: \"In former years, at a post station, I encountered the immortal master Zhang Ziyang. With simple and easy words, no more than half a sentence, the effects of verification appeared in an instant. Knowing that immortality could be learned, I privately rejoiced.\"\n\nWhat is meant by \"simple and easy\" is the unity of spirit and qi outside. Spirit relies on qi, and qi relies on spirit—this is simplicity and ease in the extreme. If one practices without seeing results, it is because one has not yet aligned with the natural path.",

      "translated_text": "The spirit and qi must naturally depend on each other, naturally unite as one—then with a single moment of stillness, one enters the boundless, indistinct realm of reverie. Cultivating the Dao is like playing chess, yet the most crucial thing is self-realization. Though a master may transmit the method, one must practice it oneself. Once mastery is achieved, skill arises naturally, and step by step, effects become evident. If one were to foretell each step’s verification in advance, it would be like chewing food for another to eat—utterly unpalatable.\n\nThe world does not understand what the two words \"emptiness\" and \"nothingness\" mean, and so falls into the trap of dull vacuity. How could they know that these two words are the essential secret of self-cultivation, the subtle principle of dual cultivation of nature and life? \"Emptiness\" means emptying the heart; \"nothingness\" means forgetting the body. Empty the heart, and the spirit becomes clear; forget the form, and the qi becomes still.\n\nLaozi gave Peng Qiu a linked ring, instructing him to fiddle with it idly. If the ring could be undone, then the person would also be liberated—this is the image of the interdependence of heart and breath. If one can forget both heart and breath, entering samadhi with ease, then the ring’s interdependence exists externally, and samadhi too exists externally. The various methods of elixir refinement are all practiced externally. When you have breath, you rely on it externally; when you have no breath, you settle externally. These two phrases suffice.\n\nIt is further said: Whether there is breath or not, you need not arrange it—simply follow the natural course. When there is breath, you rely on it externally; when there is none, you settle externally. This is called \"true emptiness refining the form.\" When yang arises and you feel a slight stirring in the outer kidneys, swiftly rely on it externally—this must be as quick as lightning, without hesitation or distraction. Rely until the stirring subsides, then settle again. Settle until the settling no longer drifts, then cease the practice. Do not rise immediately after the outer kidneys retreat; one must continue settling, so that the primordial qi felt within the body may also find its place in the acquired. If one ceases practice as soon as yang arises, the primordial qi, though obtained, will not yet have stabilized within. Thus, settling after yang arises is crucial.\n\nIt is also said: Settle once before yang arises, and once after. The great Dao of the primordial is the unity of spirit and qi. Therefore, in movement, spirit and qi are one; in stillness, spirit and qi are one. Through the interdependence of heart and breath, they settle together in the void, entering samadhi and the realm of ultimate emptiness. When stillness reaches its extreme, movement arises spontaneously. Thus, when qi moves, spirit awakens—what is called \"when the time comes, spirit knows\" is the simultaneous movement of spirit and qi. If, upon movement, one chases after delusion, they become two. If, upon movement, one does not chase after delusion but swiftly relies externally—meaning unites as one—it remains primordial, hence called \"continuing samadhi with samadhi.\" The interdependence of heart and breath is the settling of spirit.\n\nIt is further said: When spirit and qi are in great samadhi, qi moves and spirit awakens, about to depart from samadhi and separate into two. If I rely externally, I continue this samadhi, preventing separation into two, thus remaining united. At the first stirring of yang, one must not waver in thought; aligning with the natural sign, one immediately relies externally. This must be natural, decisive as a single stroke cleaving in two—how swift, how effortless! If the execution is even slightly delayed, doubt arises, and the blade cannot fall. The same applies to yang’s arising: when the outer yang stirs, hasten to rely on the breath externally, severing all ties in one stroke, leaving no lingering attachment. The slightest hesitation or delay will ruin it. In sum, only by achieving naturalness can skill and wonder arise.\n\n**Question on passing the barrier:**\nThe master said: What barrier? Do you think it refers to the twin barriers of the spine? This is a metaphor for traversing the great celestial cycle, where in the final days, there is a difficult barrier to pass. If you can settle externally, remaining utterly unmoved, empty and ever more empty, then no barrier cannot be passed. If even the slightest attachment remains to the body, the barrier cannot be crossed. You must leave the household—only by not recognizing the household can you find stability. When cold and heat assail you, your head aches as if splitting, your whole body trembles. At this moment, if you can practice the interdependence of heart and breath, all will be well. If you have not worked diligently in ordinary times, you will be utterly unable to practice at this moment, for heart and breath will have no mastery and cannot depend on each other. Only when you reach this point and still maintain control over heart and breath have you truly refined yourself to mastery. As soon as you begin practice, after ten or so breaths, your head no longer aches, your body no longer feels cold or heat, and your trembling ceases—you may then sink into deep sleep.\n\nThe master said: Your head may still ache, your body may still tremble, but your spirit is entirely external, so you do not feel it. Once yang arises, illness is transformed and dispelled. This is called \"having mastery over nature and life; my nature and life are in me, not in heaven.\" One must treat illness before it manifests; once it has manifested, it is difficult to cure. If you practice daily, and today you feel unwell or a part of your body is stiff, you know that illness has taken root there. Apply the work of emptiness upon emptiness, ensuring that part becomes supple—then the illness departs. Thus, those who study the Dao practice daily and remain free of illness, for even the slightest affliction is detected during practice and cured immediately. How could serious illness arise? This is treating illness before it manifests.\n\nThe master said: Once, while traveling, I contracted malaria and recovered after a day’s rest. In short, once you enter stillness and yang arises, all illnesses fall away.",

      "translated_text": "When externally, one relies on breath until it becomes soundless. The reason there is sound during sleep is that the heart cannot govern the qi. Every night as I sleep, I instruct someone to listen closely by the bedside to my nasal breath—no trace of sound is heard, just like an infant. With this practice sustained over time, one’s self-cultivation takes root. Thus, in movement and stillness, waking and sleeping, heart and breath unite as one, just like an infant. If tonight there is sound in my nasal breath during sleep, my family will know I am ill. When heart and breath fail to unite, I practice the next day until yang arises, and the illness departs.\n\nEssence, qi, and spirit—of these three, spirit is the Supreme Ultimate. Essence is yin, qi is yang, the two poles of the Supreme Ultimate. Moreover, when spirit resides within essence, it is called *spirit-essence*; when within qi, it is called *spirit-qi*. In sum, spirit is the commander, the marshal of essence and qi. When spirit is overused, it wearies; when essence is overused, it depletes; when qi is overused, it withers. To nourish these three, one must harmonize and cultivate them together. When heart and breath externally unite as one, then in the state of profound trance—where all is indistinct and boundless—essence, qi, and spirit deeply enter the primordial realm, which is the very barrier of my body. Nourishing them day by day, one draws forth the primordial yang of heaven and earth. How could one not attain longevity? Though we elders have exhausted the mechanism of cyclic generation and procreation, we can still replenish it and avoid irreversible decline.\n\nWhen circulating the minor celestial orbit through the body, if one has previously leaked essence even once, one must complete a full orbit to replenish it.\n\nYou ask what principles are taught in the first seven chapters of *Journey to the West*? I confess I do not understand—pray, enlighten me.\n\nMaster Wu began: Do you know Sun Wukong? Wukong was born in the Eastern Continent of Superior Beings, studied the Dao in the Western Continent of Cattle-Gift, and later proclaimed himself the Great Sage Equaling Heaven. After battling the True Lord Erlang, he was captured by Lord Laozi’s lasso and brought back to heaven, where he was placed in the furnace. What is the meaning of this?\n\nI replied that I did not know.\n\nMaster Wu asked: Have you read *Awakening to Reality*?",

      "original_text": "我说《悟真篇》是读过的，但看不懂。 吴师曰：《西游》首七回即祖述《悟真篇》一首诗，你可能想出吗？ 余沉思一歇，想不出哪一首，请指出。 吴师曰：孙悟空东胜神州出世，即“金公本是东家子”。 到西牛贺州学道，是“送往西邻寄体生”。 祖师续说，你回去吧！ 悟空说，教我到哪里去？ 祖师说，你从哪里来，还到哪里去。 悟空顿时醒悟，一斛斗翻到花果山，即“认得唤来归舍养”。 以后与二郎真君相战。 二乃火之生数，结伴六兄弟，连他七个。 七乃火之成数，即是真阴，悟空是真阳。 悟空与二郎一打，即“配得姹女结亲情”也。 其后被老君一圈收入炉中，即“送归土釜牢封固”也。 我自家想，应作如此讲，不知对不对？ 我一听之后，这种讲法，不但一生未曾遇到，且做梦亦做不到，忙即下拜，口称老师。 小儿初生时，是纯阴的。 五日以后，始能看火，因有微阳矣。 故初生之后彼即睡，睡即盗天地之阳也。 婴儿初生只知吃与睡，终日终夜睡，终日终夜盗元阳。 盗了五日，身中方有阳气之根了，故能看火，乃阳也。 纯阴纯阳之物不能对立而轻视，怕阳光故也。 如是感召，阳气日旺，至一十六岁，则充满矣。 自一岁至十岁，非惟盗天地之真阳，并盗天地之真阴。 破体之后，元阳日漏，漏尽则死。 总之，虚复夺之，虚复生之，虚复死之，生死之权属于虚空，而不在我也。 圣人教人返还，是盗天地夺造化之事。 返者返真阴，是要从虚空中去返至我身。 还者还真阳，亦要从虚空中去还至我身。 须知天地并非只盗我真阳，并盗我身中真阴。 真阴真阳两般药物，自破体以后，明明白白地被虚空盗去，则修盗者，不从虚空下手，将何自哉？ 所谓失物者，在何处失去，必至何处去寻，方能物归原主，此极易知之事也。 弹琴钓鱼，两者皆是有益身心之事，皆可以长寿，因能去杂念故也。 弹琴则心静，眼因须注视弹琴之微，故杂念不起。 钓鱼时眼常注视浮珠，一意不动，神在外边，亦能摒除杂念。 久久纯熟，心自静，神自定，神定则气和，必然之势也。 余一哥哥，八十余岁，今仍在安徽，每日上午弹半日琴，下午则与近邻游玩，要走十余里路，精神矍铄，步履轻便，得益于琴者多矣。 师谓余曰：你将来可学琴，学琴之后，工夫容易做矣。 凡做心息相依，是不容易的。 如我等全是自己下苦功磨出来的，得至今日地步。 不下死功夫，学得成吗？ 学者每不能忘身。 老子曰：“吾所以有大患者，为吾有身，及吾无身，吾有何患？ ”只此忘身两字，即大道之诀。 心息相依亦无非借此把神放在身外，忘此身躯而已。 问真空与顽空。 师曰：真空是神气同定在外边，不着色身。 顽空是执在色身上。 舍此色身，可到真空。 着此色身，即为顽空。 做睡功做到睡着后，再做再睡，睡十余天，即不要睡，再做即趋于定矣。 熟能生巧。 此巧无口诀。",
      "translated_text": "I have read *Awakening to Reality*, but I do not understand it.\n\nMaster Wu said: The first seven chapters of *Journey to the West* are based on a poem from *Awakening to Reality*—can you recall which one?\n\nAfter pondering for a moment, I could not identify it, so I asked him to point it out.\n\nMaster Wu said: Sun Wukong’s birth in the Eastern Continent of Superior Beings is “The Metal Elder is originally the Eastern House’s son.” His journey to the Western Continent of Cattle-Gift to study the Dao is “Sent to the Western neighbor to lodge the body and give birth.” The Patriarch then tells him, “Go back!” Wukong asks, “Where should I go?” The Patriarch replies, “Return whence you came.” Wukong suddenly awakens, somersaults back to the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit—this is “Recognizing the call, return to the dwelling to nurture.” Later, he battles the True Lord Erlang. Two is the generative number of fire, and with six brothers, they make seven. Seven is the consummate number of fire, representing true yin, while Wukong is true yang. Wukong’s fight with Erlang is “Matching the Maiden in conjugal harmony.” Thereafter, he is captured by Lord Laozi’s lasso and placed in the furnace—this is “Sent back to the earthen crucible for secure sealing.”\n\nI thought to myself that this must be the correct interpretation—was I right?\n\nUpon hearing this, I realized such an explanation had never crossed my mind, not even in dreams. I immediately bowed and addressed him as Teacher.\n\nWhen an infant is first born, it is purely yin. After five days, it can perceive fire, for it has acquired a trace of yang. Thus, after birth, the child sleeps, stealing the yang of heaven and earth. Newborns know only eating and sleeping, stealing primordial yang day and night. After five days of theft, the root of yang qi forms within, enabling them to see fire—this is yang. Pure yin and pure yang cannot stand in opposition or disdain, for they fear the light of yang. Through such attraction, yang qi grows daily, reaching fullness at sixteen. From one to ten years old, one not only steals the true yang of heaven and earth but also their true yin. After the body is broken, primordial yang leaks away daily, and when it is exhausted, death follows. In sum, emptiness seizes it, emptiness revives it, emptiness kills it—the power of life and death lies with emptiness, not with me.\n\nThe sage teaches people to return, which is the act of stealing from heaven and earth, seizing the workings of creation. *Return* means reclaiming true yin, drawing it from emptiness back into the self. *Restore* means restoring true yang, likewise retrieving it from emptiness into the body. Know that heaven and earth do not merely steal my true yang but also my true yin. After the body is broken, both true yin and true yang are clearly stolen by emptiness. Thus, if one seeks to reclaim them, how can one not begin with emptiness? What is lost must be sought where it was lost to return it to its rightful owner—this is self-evident.\n\nPlaying the zither and fishing are both beneficial to body and mind, promoting longevity by dispelling distracting thoughts. Playing the zither calms the heart, and since the eyes must focus on the subtle movements of the strings, stray thoughts do not arise. When fishing, the eyes remain fixed on the float, the mind undistracted, the spirit externalized—this too eliminates stray thoughts. With long practice, the heart becomes still, the spirit settled, and when the spirit is settled, qi harmonizes—this is the natural course.\n\nMy elder brother, now over eighty, still resides in Anhui. Every morning, he plays the zither for half the day, and in the afternoon, he strolls with neighbors, walking over ten *li*. His spirit is vigorous, his steps light—he owes much to the zither. My teacher told me: You should learn the zither in the future; once you do, your practice will become easier.\n\nCultivating the union of heart and breath is no simple task. For people like us, it is entirely the result of bitter toil, reaching our present state. Without relentless effort, could we have succeeded?\n\nScholars often cannot forget the self. Laozi said: “The reason I have great trouble is that I have a body. If I had no body, what trouble would I have?” These two words—*forgetting the self*—are the key to the great Dao. The union of heart and breath is nothing more than using this to place the spirit outside the body, forgetting this physical form.\n\nI asked about true emptiness and stubborn emptiness.\n\nThe teacher said: True emptiness is when spirit and qi settle together outside, unattached to the physical body. Stubborn emptiness is clinging to the physical body. Abandoning this body leads to true emptiness; clinging to it results in stubborn emptiness.\n\nIn sleep practice, after falling asleep, one continues the practice and sleeps again. After ten days of such sleep, one no longer needs to sleep, and further practice leads to samadhi. Skill comes from familiarity. This skill has no oral formula.",

      "translated_text": "“Qian and Kun are the gates and doors of the *Yi*, the father and mother of all trigrams.” The next two lines—*“Kan and Li frame the void, turning the hub and aligning the axle”*—refer to King Wen’s Later Heaven arrangement of the eight trigrams, with Li in the south and Kan in the north, describing the circulation of spirit and qi within the physical body. These four lines first clarify the internal and external, the Earlier and Later Heaven, which is what is meant by *“two layers of heaven and earth, four yin and yang.”* This is spoken in terms of duality and belongs to the Dao of the *Yi*. The following two lines—*“the four trigrams of yin and yang serve as bellows”*—are where Master Wei harmonizes Earlier and Later Heaven into one, which is the Dao of internal alchemy. The first four lines are based on the *Book of Changes*, while the latter two are Master Wei’s original insight—truly formidable. With these two lines alone, the ten thousand volumes of alchemical texts need not be read. For the principle of dual cultivation is not one matter but two. Hence it is said: *“Heaven and man unite in activation.”* One must place the heart and breath outside in the emptiness to rely upon, so that Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li merge into one—this is *“the four trigrams serve as bellows,”* and it is also the meaning of *“heaven and man unite in activation.”* In short, it is the cultivation of both the dharmakāya and the physical body. When both inside and outside the body are placed into emptiness to practice, they harmonize into one. Heart and breath rely on each other, always outside, subtly aware of each inhalation and exhalation. At first, some intention must be used, but with familiarity, intention is no longer needed. If slightly tightened outside, what harm is there? As long as one does not cling to the physical body, all is well. At first, tightening is necessary, but with familiarity, it will naturally follow. I fear you cannot leave the physical body—once you cling to it, danger arises. Do not indulge in idle talk of the Dao without practicing. If a grave illness strikes and you cannot work, alas, death follows. What benefit is there?\n\nI learned medicine through illness and the Dao through study. First, I read the *Dao De Jing*, the *Yin Fu Jing*, and other classics. *Journey to the West* was written after the Hongwu era, for many events occurred during that time. Always place the spirit outside, muddle through with it in a dead earnest effort—only then can true mastery be achieved. The union of heart and breath, brought to perfection, cannot be accomplished in a day or a night. It requires accumulated days and months of effort, persistence in diligence and constancy, and a resolve that is sincere to the end. The work must be done until you can no longer control it yourself—then it is well. Those who have completed the microcosmic orbit can project their spirit, though it is only a yin spirit, not some strange phenomenon. For when qi abides, spirit abides; when spirit abides, form abides. When heart and breath rely on each other and merge into one, all three abide. The projected spirit is the spirit in dreams transformed into pure yang—wherever intention arises, there it goes. To conceal or reveal, all follows one’s will.\n\nThe teacher said: The spirit in dreams must be mastered by you. He also said: Keep the spirit long settled outside, accumulating days and months until it becomes one with the Great Void. Naturally, there will be scenes of spirit projection in emptiness—this is the moment of departure. Spirit projection is leaving samādhi; abandoning samādhi is called the scene of spirit projection, where one sees the six directions in swirling flight. When first projecting the spirit, one should remain in samādhi longer and project for shorter periods, proceeding step by step from near to far. With maturity, there is no longer any concern. The clever always possess sharpness, which is the greatest obstacle in learning the Dao and must be avoided in practice. You must learn to be dull and foolish—only then can you truly practice. You may fix your gaze on a single character in a book, disregarding whether heart and breath rely on each other, as long as you focus on that one character without arising thoughts. For as long as you fix your gaze, the spirit remains outside. Always train to keep the spirit outside until it becomes familiar, then proceed to unite heart and breath—this will prevent clinging to the physical body. Practice this for three hours daily; falling asleep is best. When this work is perfected, the heart becomes still. When refinement of the self is complete, there are no dreams. After long absence of dreams, if a dream suddenly occurs, it is a true dream.\n\nDiscard all alchemical texts at once and focus solely on practice. Do not seek widely or study broadly—this is the truth. It is always this wretched skin-bag that causes trouble. If you can go beyond it, what harm is there?\n\nMaster Wu said: The union of heart and breath must be outside, practiced until it dies and is no longer an obstruction—this is the most crucial step in refining the self. The oral instructions for practice are divided into three stages of transmission. The first stage is the initial method; the second stage includes the transformations of fire phases and the microcosmic orbit; the final transmission comes last. Xu Jieqing had already received the second transmission, but alas, he did not practice and died.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* says: *“Occupy the correct position and abide in the body,”* and also *“Occupy the correct position and congeal destiny.”* This *“correct position”* is the one point of emptiness. *“Correct position”* is the image of the central point. Master Ge Xianweng said: *“Where Qian and Kun unite is the true center,”*—is this not the one point of emptiness? *“Abide in the body”* means to concentrate the spirit within it. *“Congeal destiny”* means that when the spirit relies on the breath for a long time, qi and breath become still, neither exiting nor entering.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* also says: *“Great centrality, with emptiness above and below.”* *“Great centrality”* is also the one point of emptiness in the center. Above is Qian, below is Kun, and the space between is emptiness—where Qian and Kun unite. Hence it is said: *“Emptiness above and below.”*",

      "translated_text": "\"Yellow Sprout and White Snow\" are metaphors for the two medicines of true yin and true yang—these are not the tangible, visible gold and silver. The alchemists of the furnace and fire deceive the world with their \"yellow-and-white\" arts, claiming secret methods to transmute gold and silver. How could they ever grasp the wondrous cultivation of *\"From emptiness arises White Snow, from stillness blooms Yellow Sprout\"*?\n\nThe man who wrote the *Family Treasure* in four collections lived to be over one hundred and sixty years old. He understood the external technique but knew nothing of the interdependence of heart and breath. He nourished his postnatal self quite well, meticulously attending to every aspect of his diet.\n\nThe Master said: Understanding the external technique means projecting the spirit outward—this is neither true emptiness nor dull emptiness. If you grasp the interdependence of heart and breath externally, your breathing ceases, your qi settles profoundly, and inner and outer become utterly still. With body and mind unmoving, that is true emptiness. Once true emptiness is attained, creation begins: the external true yang comes to your body, embracing your dharmakāya and nurturing your physical form. This moment of effort is extraordinary. How much more so if you remain in true emptiness at every instant? Even if you wished not to become immortal, could you avoid it?\n\nThe Master sighed: Those who study the Dao externally are as numerous as ox hairs, yet all blindly toil over the physical body. Those who truly comprehend the one point of true emptiness are as rare as rabbit horns. The moment you sense movement in the physical body, you rush outward. The moment you feel a melting softness or bliss, you rush outward. In short, whenever you perceive any sensation or phenomenon in the physical body, you immediately go outward to rely on it. The goal is to reach a state where you are unaware of softness or its absence, unaware of heaven and earth or inside and outside, unaware even of having a body—plunging into the boundless stillness of primal chaos. That is the way.\n\nThe physical body is a Zhu Bajie, a thief. Those who study the Dao must be willing to let go, to cast it aside, and not mistake the thief for one’s own child.\n\nHe also said: If you can steadfastly hold to the one point of emptiness at every step, never clinging to the physical body, you will be free of trouble. Once you dispel postnatal illness, I will then transmit to you the oral instructions for the fire-phase transformations. Wherever I am at that time, come to me and follow me for three to five years. Once you secure the foundation of the elixir, you may return home to live as a lofty scholar-recluse. As Zhang Sanfeng said: *\"Once the elixir foundation is laid, return home to till the soil and care for your parents, living as a lofty scholar-recluse for several years before completing the later affairs.\"* This is precisely what I mean.\n\nYou must put in the effort—without it, nothing will come of it. Even if we who study the Dao were emperors, we would not be as carefree. An emperor must attend to every matter, exhausting both mind and strength. By day, he has no leisure; by night, he finds no rest. We, however, spend our days discussing the Dao and practicing cultivation, preserving abundant essence, full qi, a tranquil spirit, and a vacant will. We are untroubled by right or wrong, free to come and go—this is no small blessing.\n\nThe Great Dao is utterly impartial and selfless. You, too, must not be selfish, thinking only of your own longevity. Longevity begins with the absence of self. To be without self is to be utterly empty and still, hollow and vast, unaware of the physical body. Observe how heaven and earth are selfless—they endure forever. Do not harbor scheming thoughts or seek to prevail. Strive to forget things and forget form, so that heart and breath naturally interdepend, and stillness arises naturally. This is the wondrous cultivation of primal chaos.\n\nAncestor Sanfeng said:\n*\"In seeking the mysterious Great Dao,\nI wandered to the ends of the earth.\nI cast aside fame and wealth,\nAbandoned home, fields, and gardens.\nThrough countless hardships,\nClothes tattered, shoes worn,\nFinding a teacher was difficult.\nAlas, sixty or seventy years of life are so brief!\"*\n\nConsider how the ancients endured such hardship and toil before encountering a true teacher and hearing the Great Dao. Since ancient times, those who attained the Dao all emerged from struggle and suffering. Look at Ancestor Qiu, tempering body and mind in Pan Brook—how much hardship he endured! Without perseverance, one can never hope to attain the Dao by luck.\n\nPreventing leakage is simple—just set aside the alchemical classics, commit wholeheartedly to practice, and rely on it at every moment. When external yang stirs, whether during practice or in ordinary thoughtless moments, do not let the mind move. Immediately turn to the external technique, and the external yang will naturally subside. With prolonged practice, this becomes second nature: yang qi will only rise and never descend, and leakage will cease.\n\nWhen the work becomes pure and natural, entering the state of dim indistinctness at any time in the day is excellent. In the twelve hours of daily practice, whenever yang arises, it is all primordial and can be gathered. The moment you become aware, the heart and breath naturally settle externally. After several dozen breaths, you enter the realm of dim indistinctness again. If yang stirs once more, the moment you realize it, the mind remains unmoved, and you naturally rely on the external once again. Do not wait for dozens of breaths—just one or two, and the yang organ will instantly subside. Then, relying again, your breathing ceases, and you enter profound stillness, unaware and unknowing, in a state of primal chaos, without self or others, forgetting things and form—like a living corpse.\n\nPractice this every day, and within a month, all manner of effects will manifest. How swift! As the *Triple Concordance* says: *\"Raise a pole and see its shadow; call into a valley and hear its echo.\"* Not a word is amiss.",
      "overlap_context": "de in the body”* means to concentrate the spirit within it. *“Congeal destiny”* means that when the spirit relies on the breath for a long time, qi and breath become still, neither exiting nor entering.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* also says: *“Great centrality, with emptiness above and below.”* *“Great centrality”* is also the one point of emptiness in the center. Above is Qian, below is Kun, and the space between is emptiness—where Qian and Kun unite. Hence it is said: *“Emptiness above and below.”*",

      "translated_text": "Yet there is one most crucial phrase—you must practice it to attain such effects. Without cultivation, even after ten thousand years you will remain unchanged; empty talk is of no use. Thus Bai Yuchan said: *\"You must eat the Yunmen cake yourself; do not merely drool while speaking of pilaf.\"* Gazing at me in silence for a long while, he moved me deeply.\n\nWhen yang first stirs, it is always the postnatal within the prenatal. The reason is this: after yang arises, your mind cannot but stir, even to the point of arousing desire for pleasure. Or at this moment, you may suddenly panic, flustered and at a loss. The master said: No matter what, the moment the mind stirs, it is no longer the prenatal within the prenatal. Therefore, when yang first stirs, the key is to detach swiftly from the physical form and hasten to the external. He also said: If you keep your thought unturned, swiftly depart from the physical form, and rely on the external with heart and breath united, you will be safe.\n\nWhether yang subsides or not, do not concern yourself with it; not the slightest attachment to phenomena of the physical form is permissible. A grave mistake is to rely on several breaths and then think, *Let me see if yang has fully subsided.* If you look, fine—yang will rise again. This single act causes great harm, instantly transforming all prenatal essence into postnatal turbidity, the original spirit into the discriminating mind, giving rise to a flood of杂念, disturbing the sovereign heart, turning original qi into turbid qi, original essence into yin essence, leading to tears, nasal discharge, and seminal leakage—all arising from this moment’s transformation.

For at the initial barrier of refining essence into qi, there is but a single yang pathway; even if leakage occurs once or twice, life remains unthreatened.

At this stage, should one cling to the physical form, peril is certain.\n\nThus the *Yinfu Jing* states: *\"The noble man who attains it preserves his person; the petty man who attains it squanders his life.\"* You must understand that where there is benefit, there is also harm—this holds true for the practice of the Dao as well.\n\nMeng of Tianjin had cultivated his skill well, yet he constantly sought to test it, measuring how long the external yang would rise or how long it would subside.

      "translated_text": "Do you not cling to the foul skin-bag, nor seek to test it—what danger could there be? Thus, what we guard against and contemplate is the inability to relinquish the body, the failure to forget form.\n\nThe master laughed and said: \"Old Meng has suffered greatly this time—now he truly believes me. Being a teacher is no easy task; if one has not traversed the path oneself, how can one transmit the Dao?\"\n\nI asked: \"What, then, is the *prior-to-prior Heaven*?\"\n\nThe master replied: \"When you reach the arising of yang, practice it day after day until it becomes thoroughly familiar—then it will arise naturally. Once it is natural, you need not manage it. Abiding in utter emptiness and profound stillness, if yang arises, your mind remains unmoved, as if unaware. Yet when heart and breath align, they naturally settle into external steadiness. This is what the *Four-Hundred-Character Inscription* means by *'lead and mercury return to true earth; body and mind are still and unmoving.'* To reach this state of stillness and non-movement is to attain the *prior-to-prior Heaven.*\n\nYang arises naturally—it arises from me, yet what concern is it of mine? You speak of the arising of yang in terms of the physical body; I speak of it in terms of the true self, the Dharma-body. It is no affair of mine. Even if yang arises a hundred times, I remain steadfast, as unshaken as Mount Tai, without the slightest stirring of thought. This is the refinement of the self brought to perfection, the foundation made firm. Is this not the work of relentless effort? Unless you temper heart and breath to the point of death, you will never reach this stage.\n\nOnly then is it true, unalloyed prior Heaven—true relinquishing of the body, true forgetting of form, truly a living corpse. The work now has roots. To gather the prior Heaven is to enter the great samādhi of the dim and indistinct, the profound and obscure—hunhun-dun-dun, knowing nothing, perceiving nothing. When first engaging the arising of yang, the key lies in attaining pure familiarity and naturalness, so that no leakage occurs. This is what is meant by *'once the yang pass is sealed, each attains longevity.'*\n\nFirst, from no arising of yang, you cultivate until yang arises. Then, from the arising of yang, you cultivate until there is no arising of yang. When external yang ceases all movement, the work of destiny is complete. The same applies to women’s cultivation.\n\nIn postnatal husband-and-wife union, there are two realms and four yin and yang—yet even this must reach the state of the dim and obscure. However, proceeding in sequence can only form an ordinary embryo. The path of Dao differs from worldly ways. Those who are sharp-witted may thrive in worldly affairs, but such clarity is ill-suited to the cultivation of Dao. The Dao values confusion—unaware, unknowing, hunhun-dun-dun.\n\nThe master added: \"The more confused you are, the faster the results appear. The stirring of yang in the depths of midnight stillness arises from within the body—this is postnatal. Entering the dim and obscure, sensing the true yang from beyond heaven and earth, and thus manifesting the arising of yang—this is prior Heaven. Yet it remains prior Heaven within the postnatal, not the *prior-to-prior Heaven.* The instant it strays outward is the moment of error.\n\nThe root of emotion is not easily severed; the threads of feeling are not easily purified. One must employ the primordial qi to gradually wash them away—this is no work of a single day or night. Only through unrelenting effort over time will results appear.\n\nLong ago, Qiu Changchun tempered himself for six years at Pan Stream. His heart became like a crystal pagoda, radiant within and without. Yet when a single deluded thought arose, the pagoda collapsed, and he wept bitterly. He resumed his tempering and ultimately succeeded in attaining the Dao.\n\nRefining the self is a process of layer upon layer of sifting away worldly emotions, until one becomes as clear as water, without the slightest dregs. Facing circumstances without emotion, unmoving in suchness—this is excellence. If there is movement, it will not suffice.\n\nBai Ziqing said: *'Forgetting form to nurture qi is the golden elixir; facing circumstances without mind is the great return.'* Cao Wenyu said: *'The mindless mind is the Dao-mind; forgetting both movement and stillness is liberation from desire.'*\n\nThe master said: \"After all, the character *forget* is most essential. In refining qi, forget form; in refining nature, forget emotion.\" Thus, the Buddhists say: *'In the present, one is mortal; when emotion is forgotten, one is Buddha.'*\n\nIf a cultivator of Dao does not know where the primordial qi resides, how can they summon and gather it? If they do not know where to direct their summoning, how can they obtain the inner elixir? To seek it within the physical body is like drilling for blood in a bronze statue. This shell of flesh—the Buddhists compare it to a poisonous tree, liken it to a snake’s den.\n\nOnce you enter the gate of Dao, you must leave this snake’s den. Come outside to settle the spirit and regulate the breath, and rebuild your household—only then is it well.\n\nHerbs and plants can only attack illnesses and regulate qi and blood; they are not the means to nurture life. The *Yellow Court Classic* says: *'Feeding solely on the harmonious qi of yin and yang, one does not die—heaven’s appearance is thus.'* It also says: *'Why not consume the harmonious, pure qi? Thus one does not die and enters the Yellow Tranquility.'* Only by ingesting the great harmonious qi can one attain longevity.\n\nSpirit and qi depend on each other. When qi dissipates, so does spirit; when both are exhausted, death follows. When qi is robust, spirit is robust; when qi gathers, spirit gathers—thus forming the inner elixir, prolonging life in the world. This is a matter of utmost certainty.\n\nThe ancients spoke of *'delusion exhausted, returning to the source.'* In truth, delusion is empty—if it ceases, it is like removing firewood from beneath a cauldron: the boiling water gradually returns to stillness. This is the metaphor of *'delusion exhausted, returning to the source.'* The key is to cease, then apply the work of stillness and forgetting—what is not real in this?\n\nIn general, when first engaging in the work, I simply abide in a state of hunhun-dun-dun, never invoking discriminating thought. Over time, the mind-ground becomes naturally pure, the spirit naturally efficacious, and wisdom naturally awakens.\"",

      "translated_text": "When examined closely, however, their teachings remain consistent, without the slightest divergence. The essence of Patriarch Xue’s words lies in the final phrase: *\"still the body and mind, unmoving.\"* When one reaches this state of stillness and immobility, both within and without the body, all is of the primordial. As Zhang Ziqiong said: *\"Heaven and man share the same qi from the beginning, yet the physical form obstructs their union. Only when refinement merges form and spirit do we realize that form is none other than true emptiness.\"* Those who speak but cannot practice are too clever; we who practice but cannot speak are too dull. Therefore, set aside the alchemical texts, commit wholeheartedly to the work—this is most urgent, most urgent.\n\nMaster Meng cultivated with utmost sincerity, devoting a fixed number of hours each day, believing more was always better. Alas! This is still clinging to form. (Here, the speaker smiled.)\n\nBaopuzi observed: *\"Of two who study the Dao, one is ignorant and knows nothing, the other is learned in all things—yet the ignorant one succeeds while the learned one fails.\"* This is a profound truth. We merely borrow heaven and earth as a dwelling, while the power over life and death rests entirely with the Void. If a cultivator can befriend the Void, they transcend heaven and earth, no longer bound by creation’s cycles. One might even say, *\"Heaven and earth are my descendants.\"* Thus, Master Shao declared: *\"Heaven and earth proceed from me—what else is there to say?\"* And Zhang Ziyang said: *\"Only then do I know my fate is not ruled by heaven.\"*\n\nThe Master added: Such words may only be shared with those of understanding; otherwise, they will think me mad.

      "translated_text": "*The Guidelines for Centering the Mind* is an excellent text—concise yet complete. Its explanation of the interlocking circle is particularly fine, describing how the mind and breath interdepend within the Void. When the entire body—from the soles of the feet (Yongquan) to the crown of the head—becomes supple, tingling, and utterly relaxed, this is the *Zhoutian* (Celestial Circuit). The Greater and Lesser Celestial Circuits originate from the greater and lesser heavens and earth. If one can fall asleep during practice, this is a sign of efficacy. Once this state of suppleness is achieved, maintaining it consistently is ideal.\n\nMind and breath interdepend first through deliberate effort, then naturally—this is the path to certain attainment. The Dao of elixir cultivation proceeds step by step. When the human mind departs, the Heavenly Mind appears; when the consciousness of discrimination recedes, the primordial spirit emerges; when the physical body is relinquished, the Dharma-body is attained. This transformation occurs with swift immediacy.\n\nListen to the breath with the ears, but do not cling to it. Let it flow naturally—do not force it. If distracting thoughts arise, return to listening, then release again. Take the Void as the essence and harmony as the function. When mind, breath, and Void merge as one, essence and function unite, and the *Cantong Qi* (The Kinship of the Three) is realized.\n\nThis treasure of the Void is ever before us, yet none pay it heed. Master Wu observed that while all alchemical texts describe the interdependence of mind and breath, *Journey to the West* illustrates it best with the image of the Golden Cudgel stored in the ear—this is precisely listening to the breath. Such methods are but expedient means for entry; the true work lies in extending one’s spirit and qi outward to harmonize with it.\n\nRegard the indistinct and profound as the master, stillness as the master, oblivion as the master, the forgetting of self and others as the master. Thus Laozi said: *\"Return to the uncarved block,\"* *\"Return to the limitless,\"* *\"Return to the state of infancy,\"* *\"I alone am dull,\"* *\"I alone am muddled,\"* *\"Tranquil, as if without sign.\"* In sum, one becomes a living corpse.\n\nSet aside the alchemical texts and practice—whether for a moment or an hour, each yields its own benefit. More is good; less is also good. Fix the gaze on a single word, neither grasping nor abandoning it. Sleeping is fine; not sleeping is also fine. Alternatively, take a prayer bead, roll it between the fingers, and focus the eyes upon it—this too is an expedient for directing the spirit outward. Where the spirit goes, qi follows. After a time, as the spirit and qi settle externally, mind and breath naturally interdepend.\n\nConsider this: If I wished to strike your arm, my eyes would fix upon it, and the blow would land precisely where my gaze rests—nowhere else. This illustrates the principle. Cai Fuyang likewise said: *\"When I lift a chair, the intention is the spirit; the lifting is the qi.\"* The Master affirmed this.\n\nWhen mind and breath interdepend, this is the primordial; without practice, it is the postnatal. From mind-breath interdependence to the indistinct and profound, the indistinct and profound becomes the primordial, while mind-breath interdependence becomes the postnatal. From the indistinct and profound to utter stillness—no coming, no going, no self, no other, no knowing, no awareness, forgetting things and cares, merged in chaos—this great stillness is the primordial, while the indistinct and profound becomes the postnatal. Each stage ascends further.\n\nThus, one first returns from the postnatal to the primordial, then from the primordial to the primordial’s primordial, and from there to the limitless—without beginning, without end. The work is then complete.\n\nThe Master entrusted me with key instructions for Brother Meng:\n\nFirst, cease practice.\nSecond, study *The Profound Essentials of the Golden Elixir* thoroughly and discard all other alchemical texts.\nThird, I am to explain in detail a passage from the *Profound Essentials* I transcribed for him, emphasizing that he must not resume practice for two or three years. Any attempt to practice now would only reinforce attachment, which is itself the malady.\n\nI must also warn Brother Meng that attachment is profoundly harmful. If not eradicated now, while the illness is still shallow, it may cripple his progress entirely. He must cease practice for two or three years, empty his heart, and reach the state of forgetting things and form before attempting again.\n\nZhen Qingshan has also asked me to inquire of Brother Meng and relay his questions:\n1. Since beginning practice, has his health improved, or has it declined compared to before?\n2. His inability to forget the body and form, his persistent attachment, may stem from prolonged ingestion of medicinal decoctions, which have damaged his body. During practice, when extreme emptiness and profound stillness are reached, latent injuries may react, causing discomfort, pain, or various phenomena that prevent forgetting form and force attachment to the body. He asks if this has been Brother Meng’s experience and requests a detailed reply.\n3. If any uncertainties arise in the future, he may write freely to inquire, so as to ease his mind and prevent hesitation.\n\nThe Master’s final admonition: attachment is the greatest obstacle—it must be uprooted now, or it will forever hinder his progress.",

      "translated_text": "The return to the youthful state takes only six or seven days. The fastest is five days—this is considered superior and indicates that one’s practice has been exceptionally well executed. Next may be six or seven days. If by the seventh day one has not returned to the youthful state, the practice has faltered, and one can only achieve *shijie* (corpse liberation) rather than ascension. It is further said: these six or seven days are the critical threshold for transcending the mundane and entering sagehood. If one fails to pass this point, there is no hope of achieving the transformation of the spiritual embryo—only *shijie* remains.\n\nMaster Wu states that to ascend, one must reverse the body within seven days. He expounds on the four lines from the *Four-Hundred-Character Inscription*: *\"True Earth seizes True Lead.\"*\n\nThe Master says: *True Earth*—externally, this is the void; within me, it is true intention. *\"True Earth seizes True Lead\"* means that when the breath enters and exits externally, one employs a subtle awareness to perceive it—this is what is called \"using spirit to govern qi.\" *True Lead* is true breath. It is called \"true\" because it is not the postnatal respiration but rather the subtle movement and stillness of the external world. Once one clings to the physical body, one falls into postnatal breathing, and it is no longer true.\n\n*True Earth* is true intention. It is called \"true\" because it is the breath of no-breath—existing yet not existing, neither attached nor detached, the wondrous intention of neither forgetting nor forcing. If one grasps too tightly, one falls into the postnatal human mind, and it is no longer true. *\"Seizes\"* means to govern, to rely upon. Through this method of regulation, one enables the breath to be continuous and dense, leisurely and fine, mutually inhaling and exhaling, mutually cherishing and loving, intertwining into a single mass, forming an unbroken whole. Then, *True Lead* naturally restrains *True Mercury*.\n\n*True Mercury* is one’s original spirit. *True Mercury* and *True Earth* are originally indistinguishable: before intention arises, it is *True Mercury*; once intention arises, it is *True Earth*. The line above, *\"True Earth seizes True Lead,\"* describes using subtle intention to govern the breath, causing heart and breath to rely upon each other. The line *\"True Lead restrains True Mercury\"* means that after long reliance, the breath will not abandon the spirit, and they intertwine, merging into one.\n\nAs Master Ziyang said:\n*\"Wood’s nature loves metal’s righteousness,\nMetal’s affection clings to wood’s kindness.\nMutually swallowing, mutually devouring, yet mutually intimate—\nOnly then does the man conceive.\"*\n\nThis is precisely the meaning. One must understand that *\"True Lead restrains True Mercury\"* is the ultimate state of naturalness—true emptiness and wondrous existence rely upon each other naturally, even the subtle intention from before is forgotten, and together they enter the realm of nothingness.\n\nThus, *\"Lead and Mercury return to True Earth; body and mind are still and unmoving.\"* Why is it called *\"Lead and Mercury return to True Earth\"*? Because after long reliance, the breath’s entry and exit become increasingly fine and subtle, eventually ceasing altogether. Heart and breath become fixed, returning to the state before birth, merging into the realm of emptiness. As Laozi said: *\"Return to the limitless,\"* *\"Return to infancy,\"* *\"Return to simplicity,\"* *\"Return to the root\"*—all express this meaning. At this point, one’s body and mind remain perpetually still, equal in measure to the void.\n\nIn this state, one forgets things and form, knows nothing, understands nothing, merges into chaos, without heaven or earth, inside or outside, beginning or end—directly entering the realm of great harmony, free from thought or worry, unmoving and unshaken. Hence, it is said: *\"Body and mind are still and unmoving.\"* If, at this moment of extreme emptiness and profound stillness, one’s intention turns toward thought or clings to the physical body, the pristine state of the prior heaven instantly transforms into the turbid matter of the posterior heaven, and it no longer accords with the principle of *\"still and unmoving.\"*\n\nOne must recognize that the three words *\"still and unmoving\"* truly embody the image of the prior-heaven limitless. This is a state one must attain—it cannot be overlooked. See how these four lines have already expounded the entire path of internal alchemy—how direct and straightforward!\n\nThe next four lines, *\"From emptiness, white snow arises,\"* can be summarized in one phrase: the medicine is born and gathered. Let me explain further. *White snow and yellow sprouts* refer to the birth of mercury—within the great stillness, the prior-heaven qi naturally arrives from the void into one’s body; this is the production of the medicine.\n\n*\"The jade crucible is warm\"* describes the external state of heart and breath relying upon each other, harmonious and unified, neither forgetting nor forcing. Then, naturally, purple clouds ascend above the crown—this is *\"White clouds rise to the upper palace; sweet dew sprinkles Mount Sumeru.\"* It is nothing other than the mutual reliance of heart and breath.\n\nThe next four lines, *\"The lotus blooms in the flower pool,\"* again describe the reliance of heart and breath, sustained until extreme emptiness and profound stillness, where yang naturally revives. See how lines like *\"Deep in the night, the moon shines bright; heaven and earth are a single mirror\"* are so exquisite! Without arduous effort, one could never compose such verses. Yet mere literary beauty is useless.\n\nMaster Wuyuan also has two lines: *\"A bright moon illuminates the heart of heaven; at midnight, thunder shakes the divine land,\"* which are identical in meaning. Only when practice reaches its utmost can such words emerge.\n\nThe next four lines, *\"Cinnabar refines yang qi,\"* again describe the reliance of heart and breath. True yin and true yang are released into the void, merging into one, transforming into a pool of water. Body and mind are forgotten, and the entire being feels blissfully soft and supple. As the *Canticle* says: *\"Flowing from head to feet, ultimately ascending again. Coming and going through the boundless void, gently enveloped within\"*—all describe this state.\n\nThe final four lines, *\"Medicine and substance arise in the mysterious aperture,\"* again describe the reliance of heart and breath. The first two lines refer to the arrival of prior-heaven qi, which must swiftly be met with external reliance.",

      "translated_text": "The yang furnace and the mysterious aperture are but a single void; when their alignment is ingenious, the mystic pearl naturally manifests within the corporeal form. Thus it is said: *\"When dragon and tiger unite, the precious crucible yields the mystic pearl\"*—this is the metaphor for the coalescence of the elixir. The four lines *\"This aperture is no ordinary aperture\"* are most excellent. If one seeks it within the corporeal form, it becomes *\"Kan and Li conjoined as one\"*—not *\"Qian and Kun conjoined as one.\"* That it is called *\"the cavity of spirit and qi\"* means one must release spirit and qi into this cavity to interdepend, for this is the twofold heaven and earth, the fourfold yin and yang, the dual cultivation of nature and life.\n\nThe Master said: In sum, the four characters *\"heart and breath interdepend\"* can penetrate the myriad volumes of alchemical texts. The *Guidelines for Centering* depicts seven stars—this is the celestial revolution. The handle of the Dipper remains unmoving, symbolizing the stillness of one’s heart, settled in the external; the remaining six stars revolve and rotate to form the four peaks, symbolizing the true qi steaming and pervading, threading through the entire body, irrigating and circulating throughout. The *Triple Concordance Canon* says: *\"Trickling like spring rain, flowing like melting ice. From head to feet it flows, ultimately ascending again. Coming and going through the boundless void, gently enveloped within\"*—all describe this.\n\nNow to discuss the three lines: *\"Forget form to nurture qi, forget qi to nurture spirit, forget spirit to nurture the void.\"* The Master said: The word *\"forget\"* is the true key; one should take this as a compass. These three lines are peerlessly sublime. The dual cultivation of nature and life comprises two matters, not one. The previously mentioned twofold heaven and earth and fourfold yin and yang, put plainly, are the cultivation of the dharmakāya alongside the corporeal form. The work is done entirely upon the dharmakāya, while the effects manifest entirely at the corporeal form’s edge. The external is the work of life, which through effort becomes natural; thus, the corporeal form naturally undergoes transformative effects—this is called *\"principle of nature.\"* The principle of nature cannot be managed; it is the spontaneity of non-action. The external is called *\"life\"* because all methods—such as kindling and ceasing the fire, harmonizing and compounding the medicine—are enacted externally, constituting the spontaneity of action. Thus it is said: the dual cultivation of nature and life. For in cultivating the external work of life, the principle of nature is already concurrently cultivated. Moreover, the twofold heaven and earth and fourfold yin and yang are precisely the purport of the dual cultivation of nature and life. The external is the dharmakāya, the position of the void, the prior-heaven, Qian and Kun. The internal is the corporeal form, already broken in substance, thus the posterior-heaven, Kan and Li. When one’s spirit and qi are released into the external void, Kan, Li, Qian, and Kun unite as one, and transformation naturally occurs. I say that when one’s spirit and qi are released into the external void to unite, all action takes place externally, while effects manifest entirely upon the corporeal form—only then is it called the dual cultivation of nature and life. Initially, the Master spoke of two matters, not one, which I did not yet comprehend; now I have suddenly understood.\n\nThe two words *\"let go\"* are most crucial. Letting go of the human mind is the Dao-mind; letting go of the corporeal form is attaining the dharmakāya; letting go of the acquired spirit is revealing the original spirit. If you can let go, the effects will be swift. Dispel one part of distracting thoughts, and you gain one part of the treasure; dispel ten parts of distracting thoughts, and you gain ten parts of the treasure. In practice, one must reach the arising of yang to see some effects. Thereafter, the more one practices, the more refined and natural it becomes. When yang arises, you go externally to interdepend—eventually, without your mind’s vexation, the moment it arises, you become aware, and heart and breath naturally settle externally, perfectly aligned, which is the proper method. True intention resides between intention and non-intention.\n\nMaster Yuzi said: *\"When external yang stirs, it is the living midnight.\"* This saying truly misleads people, for it is ten thousand miles from the great prior-heaven Dao. Later practitioners, unaware, follow this method: when external yang stirs, they hastily employ intention to gather it, and illness is unavoidable. One must instead interdepend heart and breath externally, interdepending until one reaches the state of indistinct obscurity, primordial chaos, and great serenity. Within this serenity, if yang stirs, swiftly move to the external—thus is it attained. It is not said that indistinct obscurity is the living midnight, but rather that external yang alone stirs—those who have not even dreamed of the Dao. The stirring of yang in stillness is merely the posterior-heaven corporeal form’s physiological cycle, not the Dao. Yang stirring within indistinct obscurity is the posterior-heaven’s prior-heaven—useless. One must reach the state where internal and external are both utterly void and still, entering great serenity, wherein a single yang stirs. Within serenity, one suddenly feels the entire body suffused with a tingling numbness, like dew or lightning. When true yang arrives, your heart does not move; naturally, it interdepends externally. After three to five breaths, serenity returns as before—only then is it the prior-heaven’s prior-heaven.\n\nThe greatest difficulty is that words cannot touch the body, yet in practice, one cannot avoid being touched—it is all bodily. You must first cultivate a stillness practice, able to settle spirit externally, and then you need not fear this. To be touched by the body is inadmissible, and to be touched by all prior-heaven phenomena is also inadmissible; the ultimate is to be untouched. The great Dao is impartial: some may study a lifetime and not attain it, while others may achieve the Dao in two or three years. Take Zhang Zhennu—she was a courtesan who met Lüzu and attained liberation in two years. Or Li Maiyu, illiterate, who attained the Dao in two or three years.",

Coming and going through the boundless void, gently enveloped within\"*—all describe this state.\n\nThe final four lines, *\"Medicine and substance arise in the mysterious aperture,\"* again describe the reliance of heart and breath. The first two lines refer to the arrival of prior-heaven qi, which must swiftly be met with external reliance.",

      "translated_text": "Bright clarity is of no use. Otherwise, the illiterate would be greatly disadvantaged. The master sighed and said: \"What matters is the ability to be muddled—this is the key. Those who do not read alchemical texts progress fastest in their practice. Formerly, I cultivated alongside Huaijing and Yuanbo—Yuanbo was the one who did not read, and of the three, his progress was swiftest. From this, we know that the muddled necessarily live long, while the astute necessarily die young. The muddled let things pass as they are, content with three hundred and sixty days free of cares; their spirit remains whole, and so they attain longevity. The astute are not so: they lose in the east and compensate in the west, falter in the past and triumph in the future, measuring and weighing, attending to this and fretting over that—every detail scrutinized, their spirit wearied and essence depleted, their minds burdened with cares, and thus they die young. Only by shedding this foul carcass does verification come like splitting bamboo, success following step by step without danger.\n\nThe Dark Emperor ascended from the Cliff of Abandoning the Body on Mount Wudang, demonstrating the essential act of relinquishment. It is not only during practice that one must abandon the physical form—through all twelve hours of the day, one must relinquish it. To abandon it only during practice is already too late. Cultivate this habit until, in all twelve hours, you can shed the physical form at every moment: I settle my own nature, letting things be as they are, never encumbered by the body. Only then, in practice, will there be no attachment to form.\n\nThe reason you cannot abandon the body during practice is that you cannot abandon it in ordinary times. You must always keep mind and breath interdependent externally, forgetting form at every moment. When this becomes natural, there is no self, no other, not a speck of dust—then practice comes easily. Thus, Bai Yuchan said:\n*A word or half a phrase reveals the mystery—\nWhat need for alchemical texts by the thousands?\nIf one is not burdened by form,\nThe Great Heaven of the Dao lies before the eyes.*\n\nThis verse is excellent, unmatched in its directness. All in the Dao arises from four yin and two yang, two heavens and two earths, forming the human—a thing of four great illusory aggregates. The immortal Dao likewise arises from four yin and two yang, two heavens and two earths, forming the sage—a thing of four great true aggregates. I have elucidated this in *The Profound Essentials of the Golden Elixir*; reflect upon it.\n\nAfter this book was printed, I revised the draft several times, adding over a hundred entries, then had it carved into blocks for transmission to the world.\"",

      "translated_text": "When Yuanbo completed the Minor Celestial Cycle within his body and reverted to the state of a youthful frame, he then devoted another six months of practice, aiming to stabilize it at a fixed duration of four hours. Yet Yuanbo settled at two and a half hours and began the process, encountering considerable danger. For Master Wu, before departing, had repeatedly instructed: \"If you stabilize it at four hours, you will surely come to no harm.\" After Yuanbo had turned his body around, I asked him: \"Master Wu clearly said to stabilize it at four hours—why did you not follow his advice and rush ahead so hastily?\" He replied: \"At two and a half hours, I did not dare to take risks or seek speed; it was simply that the bliss was unbearable, so I could not but proceed.\"\n\nMaster Wu said: \"Through Yuanbo’s practice, we have gained countless insights. I say that the five viscera and six bowels do not truly exist, yet no one believes me. Such profound teachings—when beginners hear them, they immediately reject them. Alas, this stinking bag of skin is but an illusory arising, destined for illusory dissolution. The five viscera and six bowels are merely a sack of illusory, filthy pus within this stinking bag. When I say they do not exist, I speak from the perspective of the primordial True Emptiness. Yet people cling to the notion that they possess them, no wonder they remain attached to the physical form until death without awakening. How difficult it is to cultivate the Dharma-body!\n\nAfter attaining the Dao, one must still transform the physical body into qi—only then are both form and spirit wondrous, merging with the true Dao. If one merely releases a spirit, though it may perform a thousand transformations, it remains spiritually wondrous yet physically unrefined.\"\n\nI asked: \"How can a tangible physical body be transformed into the intangible?\" The Master replied: \"You were originally nothing—how then did you come to possess a body of five or six feet? I implored the Master to further elucidate the principle. He said: \"From nothing comes something—this is 'descending from the root and flowing to the branches to generate the myriad things.' From something returns nothing—this is returning to the root and reverting to the origin to become a true immortal. If one can proceed in sequence, how can one not reverse the course? These subtleties are understood by those who have completed the Celestial Cycle within their bodies.\n\nFor example, qi condenses into dew, and dew condenses into pearls. If one takes a block of solid ice and melts it with fire, it instantly becomes water and then vapor—thus can the tangible return to the intangible. The practice must reach a state of natural mastery.

      "translated_text": "Observe a village woman weaving cloth: once seated at the loom, her head, eyes, hands, and feet all move in perfect order, yet she can still converse with others, listening with her ears and speaking with her mouth. Consider how she achieves this—it defies explanation. It is simply that her skill has become so refined that mastery arises naturally. Another example: a craftsman building a chimney a hundred feet high, suspended on all sides in midair, yet he feels no fear, working with his hands while speaking, at ease as if nothing were amiss. Ask him how he does it, and he cannot say. The reason is the same: it is all a matter of naturalness.\n\nThe union of mind and breath is no different. At this moment, you are like beginners learning to weave—once seated at the loom, you attend to your feet only to disorder your hands, or focus on your eyes only to neglect your feet. There is no other reason: you have not yet attained pure natural mastery. If you can devote yourself utterly to the work, there will come a day of effortless proficiency.\n\nNow, let us examine the character *fo* (Buddha). It does not mean clinging to the physical body as the true self; it teaches the abandonment of the self, the relinquishing of life, the absence of self and form, the forgetting of the body. As for the character *xian* (immortal), the Master says: *Ren* (人, person) refers to the human mind, while *shan* (山, mountain) symbolizes immobility. Only when the union of mind and breath reaches its utmost stillness does the human mind become as unshaken as a mountain, without going or coming—this is what it means to be an immortal. Master Yuchan said, *\"Facing the world without a mind is the great return,\"* pointing to this very principle. Both *xian* and *fo* share the radical *ren* (人), showing that immortals and Buddhas are cultivated from humanity. The creation of characters is no trivial matter—observe *ming* (明, brightness), *yi* (易, change), *miao* (妙, subtlety), *gui* (圭, jade tablet), and *dao* (道, Way): each contains profound principles.\n\nTrue mastery requires reaching the point of seeming madness. Thus, among the immortals of old, there were those like Wang Chongyang, who feigned madness and was called \"Wang the Mad.\" The Master says: You must reach the state where you can roll on the ground, then rise and eat as if nothing happened, spending your days in unknowing simplicity, drifting in primordial chaos—only then have you arrived. When idle, emulate a fool, practicing stillness, projecting your spirit beyond the body, untouched by its form—this brings benefit. Those who cultivate the Dao must know contentment, free from improper desires, and remain single-minded, without thoughts of luck or chance.\n\nThe Great Harmony’s eternal *qi* abides, yet the obstacle lies in our inability to sense and draw it in. Li Daochun said, *\"The two words 'body' and 'mind' are both medicine and fire.\"* Body and mind are none other than spirit and *qi*. Shi Xinglin also said, *\"Know the medicine and fire, and within stillness you will witness the elixir’s completion.\"* The character *ding* (定, stillness) is most crucial. Xue Daoguang said, *\"In still breath, seek true lead.\"* This is the oral formula. *Dingxi* (定息, still breath) means the calming of inhalation and exhalation. The ancient immortals said, *\"Without stillness, yang does not arise.\"* When stillness deepens to the point where body and mind are utterly motionless, equal to the vastness of empty space, the path beyond the mundane opens.\n\nWhen a person dies, it is the end, yet grasses and trees wither in winter only to sprout anew in spring. This is because they return to their root, while humans cannot. In truth, humans are not even equal to grasses and trees. Thus, Zhang Sanfeng said, *\"Learn the grasses’ and trees’ method of gathering at the head, returning to life by reverting to the root.\"* When spirit and *qi* are gathered into the Mysterious Pass, this is returning to the root. Laozi said, *\"The gate of the Mysterious Female is called the root of heaven and earth.\"* This Mysterious Pass is not only the root of heaven and earth but also the root of our very existence. When spirit and *qi* return to their root, this is the Way of deep roots and firm stems.\n\nShi Jianwu said, *\"The wondrous existence of the single spirit pervades the Dharma realm. Departing from all extremes, it firmly holds to the center.\"* These four lines describe the union of mind and breath. *Yiling* (一灵, single spirit) is spirit; *miaoyou* (妙有, wondrous existence) is *qi*; *li zhongzhong bian* (离种种边, departing from all extremes) points to the external emptiness; *zhong* (中, center) is the Mysterious Pass; *yunzhi* (允执, firmly holding) means spirit and breath embracing each other, continuously abiding. Is this not the union of mind and breath?\n\nIn *Fanghu Waishi*, one need only read the *Dao De Jing* and *Xuanlan*—the rest may be set aside, for they deal with forms. Were it not for my practice, I would have died many times over. Do not assume, because you are young, that death will not come for you—human affairs are unpredictable.",

      "original_text": "二月前我得了虐痢，足亦肿了，做工三天而全愈。 目下此肿病，上海甚风行，人也死了不少。 我有一门人，亦患此病甚危险，今天不知死了没有。 讲三丰翁：“知我内丹成，不讲筑基业。 赐我外丹功，可怜谆告切”。 师曰：内丹就是炼性，是性功，是静功根柢。 心既空，神既静，意既定，则内丹已成，所以不必耳，不讲筑基之业。 “赐我外丹功”者，乃是外面虚空一着，采取配合，烹炼归炉等事。 “可怜谆告切”者，口口相传，外面火候变化之细微也。 谆谆告诫，细细叮咛，故曰谆告切。 下即曰：“炼己忘世情，采药按时节”。 你看他着书，句句不空泛，多好。 炼己要忘世情，忘字很重要，必要将尘念损之又损，以至于无为。 《清净经》云：“内观其心，心无其心。 外观其形，形无其形。 远观其物，物无其物。 三者既悟，惟见于空。 观空亦空，空无所空。 所空既无，无无亦无。 无无既无，湛然常寂。 寂无所寂，欲岂能生？ 欲既不生，即是真静。 真常应物，真常得性。 常应常静，常清静矣”。 非忘己忘物而忘忘者乎？ “采药按时节“，工夫熟巧，恰恰合法也。 夫时者，活子时也。 节者符节也。 此二字最要紧。 阳一生，心里一晓得，仍然丝毫不动而心已在外面定住，即是按时节也。 总之，先天大道皆在恍惚杳冥之中，得其至灵至妙者，方是先天之先天。 若心里起大明觉，即是落后天，即非“恍惚里相逢，杳冥中有变”之旨矣。 故不能明白，最要是糊涂。 余问：何谓筑基？ 师曰：心空了，即是筑基成。 炼己则外面一着，心息相依也。 筑基有限，炼己无穷。 炼己须至脱胎，然后用不着。 全始全终，尽是炼己也。 南五祖书较北七真高。 北七真马丹阳之书最好，其师王重阳所不能及。 好丹书自唐宋以下，不过十余家，历历可数也。 钟吕二祖是好的，白玉蟾是好的，张虚靖真人是好的，刘海蟾是好的，马丹阳是好的，张三丰是好的，陆潜虚、李涵虚二家是好的，郑和阳是好的。 再张紫阳、魏伯阳、许旌阳，亦不过数家而已。 《性命圭旨》云：“父母生前一点灵，不灵只为结成形。 成形罩却光明种，放下依然彻底清”。 师曰：惟其世人不能放下，所以不能彻底清耳。 玉蟾翁云：“一言半句便通玄，何用丹书千万篇。 人若不为形所累，眼前便是大罗天”。 师曰：惟其世人不能忘形，所以不能到大罗天耳。 此种诗真好，多少直捷爽快，一超直入。 奈何尔等以为平常而忽之。",
      "translated_text": "Two months ago, I contracted malarial dysentery, and my feet swelled as well. After three days of practice, I fully recovered. This swelling ailment is now rampant in Shanghai, and many have died from it. One of my disciples also fell gravely ill with it—who knows if he has passed today or not.\n\nSpeaking of Master Sanfeng: *\"Knowing my inner elixir is complete, / I need not speak of laying the foundation. / Bestow upon me the outer elixir’s work— / How earnest and urgent the exhortation!\"* The Master said: The inner elixir is the refinement of *xing* (nature), the work of *xing*, the root of stillness practice. When the heart is empty, the spirit is still, and the intent is settled, the inner elixir is already formed—hence there is no need to speak of laying the foundation. *\"Bestow upon me the outer elixir’s work\"* refers to the external, wondrous technique of gathering, harmonizing, refining, and returning to the furnace. *\"How earnest and urgent the exhortation!\"* speaks of the oral transmission, the subtle transformations of external fire-timing. Earnestly admonished, meticulously instructed—hence *\"earnest and urgent.\"*\n\nNext, it says: *\"Refine the self, forgetting worldly cares; / Gather the medicine, following the seasons.\"* See how every line in his writings is substantial, how excellent! Refining the self requires forgetting worldly cares—the word *\"forget\"* is crucial. One must diminish worldly thoughts again and again, until reaching non-action. The *Qingjing Jing* states: *\"Inwardly observe the heart—there is no heart. Outwardly observe the form—there is no form. Distantly observe things—there are no things. When these three are realized, only emptiness is seen. Observe emptiness, and even emptiness is empty. When the emptied is no more, even ‘no-emptiness’ is no more. When ‘no-emptiness’ is no more, there is only profound stillness. When stillness is no longer stillness, how can desire arise? When desire does not arise, this is true stillness. Responding to things with true constancy, one attains true nature. Constant in response, constant in stillness—this is constant purity.\"* Is this not forgetting the self, forgetting things, and even forgetting forgetting?\n\n*\"Gather the medicine, following the seasons\"*—when skill in practice is perfected, it precisely accords with the method. *\"Season\"* refers to the *huo zishi* (living midnight); *\"node\"* refers to the tally. These two words are most essential. When yang first arises, the heart instantly perceives it, yet remains utterly unmoved, the heart already settled externally—this is *\"following the seasons.\"* In sum, the great precelestial Dao lies within the indistinct and obscure. Only by attaining its utmost subtlety and wonder does one reach the precelestial before the precelestial. If the heart gives rise to great clarity and awareness, it falls into the postcelestial—this is not the meaning of *\"meeting in the indistinct, transforming in the obscure.\"* Thus, one must not seek clarity; the key is to remain muddled.\n\nI asked: What is *\"laying the foundation\"*? The Master said: When the heart is empty, the foundation is laid. Refining the self is the external technique—mind and breath embracing each other. Laying the foundation has limits; refining the self is boundless. One must refine the self until rebirth, after which it is no longer needed. From beginning to end, it is all refining the self.\n\nThe writings of the Southern Five Ancestors surpass those of the Northern Seven Perfected. Among the Northern Seven, Ma Danyang’s works are the finest—even surpassing his teacher Wang Chongyang. Among good alchemical texts from the Tang and Song dynasties onward, there are scarcely more than a dozen, all clearly enumerable. The works of Ancestors Zhong and Lü are excellent; Bai Yuchan’s are excellent; Zhang Xuqing the Perfected’s are excellent; Liu Haichan’s are excellent; Ma Danyang’s are excellent; Zhang Sanfeng’s are excellent; the two schools of Lu Qianxu and Li Hanxu are excellent; Zheng Heyang’s are excellent. Beyond these, Zhang Ziyang, Wei Boyang, and Xu Jingyang—there are only a few more.\n\nThe *Xingming Guizhi* states: *\"Before parents’ birth, a single numinous spark— / Unluminous only because form congealed. / When form veils the radiant seed, / Lay it down, and clarity returns in full.\"* The Master said: It is only because worldly people cannot lay things down that they cannot attain thorough clarity.\n\nMaster Yuchan said: *\"A word or half a phrase reveals the profound— / What need for alchemical texts by the thousands? / If one is not burdened by form, / The Great Brahma Heaven lies before one’s eyes.\"* The Master said: It is only because worldly people cannot forget form that they cannot reach the Great Brahma Heaven. Such poetry is truly fine—how direct and swift, leaping straight to the essence! Yet how is it that you all dismiss it as ordinary and overlook it?",
      "overlap_context": "the external emptiness; *zhong* (中, center) is the Mysterious Pass; *yunzhi* (允执, firmly holding) means spirit and breath embracing each other, continuously abiding. Is this not the union of mind and breath?\n\nIn *Fanghu Waishi*, one need only read the *Dao De Jing* and *Xuanlan*—the rest may be set aside, for they deal with forms. Were it not for my practice, I would have died many times over. Do not assume, because you are young, that death will not come for you—human affairs are unpredictable.",

      "translated_text": "Someone wrote a letter expounding at length—thousands of words—on the history of the *Taiji* circle. The more a disciple pressed for an answer, the more the Master refused to reply. The disciple then cited sayings such as *\"Rotten wood cannot be carved, nor can a wall of dung be plastered,\"* and enclosed three cents in postage, insisting the Master respond. The Master had already drafted a reply and showed it to me. It read, in part: *\"A single sweep of clarity—this is my answer to you.\"* He further wrote: Lü Dongbin said, *\"The true scripture was originally wordless.\"* Heyang Weng said, *\"All written sutras on paper are but dregs.\"* Chen Shangyang’s commentary on the *Awakening to Reality* states: *\"The nine schools and hundred traditions, with their arts for responding to the world, may all be transmitted on paper—only the Golden Elixir cannot be written down.\"* The *Triple Concordance Canon* says: *\"The Three, the Five, and the One are the essence of Heaven and Earth. They may be transmitted orally but cannot be conveyed in writing.\"* It also says: *\"Heaven and Earth are vast and boundless; the Great Mystery has no form. Void and still, it cannot be seen—its vastness dissolves into nothingness.\"* And again: *\"The primordial essence cannot be perceived.\"* Laozi said: *\"It cannot be seen, cannot be heard, cannot be grasped.\"* Since ancient times, those who attained the Dao have all said it cannot be transmitted in writing, yet you insist I write it out for you. Consider: have I wronged you, or have you wronged me? If you seek annotations on the *Taiji* diagram, the *Compendium of Nature and Principle* in the Ming edition contains over a dozen commentaries. But when it comes to returning to the root, they are all like drilling into a bronze man for blood or clinging to clay idols and written words. What use is it to read a thousand such works?\n\nThe Master said: All these discussions of the *Taiji* circle—long or short—are merely copied from the *Comprehensive Mirror*. What use are they? He added: In ancient times, those who sought a master sought one who had attained the Dao. What are you bringing forth on your own? Today’s seekers of the Dao all boast of their own learning—this much or that—but they are still millions of miles from the true path. He also said: I receive many letters daily, and with no one to write replies for me, I only respond after two or three accumulate. Even then, I am forced to oblige. And now he encloses three cents in postage—what do I need it for? It is not as if I refuse to reply for want of three cents.\n\nThe Master sighed: This is how people seek the Dao nowadays. At that moment, I was deeply moved. There are those who have followed the Master for twenty or thirty years and still have not heard a single word from him. In cultivating the Dao, single-minded devotion is essential. People of past and present alike treat it as a game—no wonder the Master is dissatisfied.\n\nI rise at eight, wash my face, and eat congee. By nine, I lie on the rattan couch to work. After about two and a half hours, I rise at eleven-thirty. If letters arrive, I read them; if not, I revise the *Mysterious Essentials of the Golden Elixir*. I take lunch at twelve-thirty, receive visitors from one to four, and after four, lie on the bed to practice. I rise at seven. If I cannot begin at four, I start at four-thirty. I must practice at five—no more politeness with you all. Once you impose control, you fall into the postnatal. The moment you seek results, you fall into the postnatal.\n\nHe also said: In worldly affairs, the danger is lack of clarity; in cultivating the Dao, the danger is lack of confusion. In worldly affairs, the greatest fear is having no master; in cultivating the Dao, the greatest fear is having one. He added: To say it has nothing to do with the physical body is still superficial. To reach the truth, it must have no connection whatsoever with the mind, consciousness, or intent—only then is it the true primordial of the primordial. Such words must be realized through practice; they are profoundly abstruse. Yet how few believe them! Truly, those who understand are rare.\n\nI asked about reclusion. The Master said: It lies in the heart, not in one’s surroundings. As the ancients said, *\"The great Dao is hidden in the marketplace.\"* What need is there to speak of reclusion? If I wish to practice, I can do so here. He said: Outside, there is chaos, but here I am at peace—eating, sleeping, free of cares. Where else would I go? It is not necessarily quieter elsewhere.\n\nI asked when he would return to the childlike state. The Master said: Only after settling family matters and going to Huaijing’s place. One cannot succeed at home, for there are always attachments. When I practice, if my little granddaughter climbs onto the table, I see her and fear she might fall, so I call someone to take her away. Such distractions are endless. Once I leave home, I can practice without concern; let them manage the household—I will not be distracted. As the saying goes: *\"Out of sight, out of mind.\"*\n\nI said: You are now seventy-eight. If family matters cannot be settled at once, and you return to the childlike state at eighty or ninety, will the practice not become even more difficult? The Master said: Not so. It depends on one’s daily practice, not age. The older one is, the deeper the practice, the more the heart dies—returning to the childlike state becomes easier. Many ancients only undertook this work in old age, precisely for this reason.\n\nI asked: When you practice at home, who serves as your dharma protectors?",

      "translated_text": "The Master said: One is surnamed Zhong, the other Wang. The one surnamed Zhong is from Guangdong, quite tall in stature—he is Zhong Zhicheng. He has followed me for over a decade. In Shanghai, I rely entirely on his assistance. He has practiced with me three times already, and now he is coming again. The Master then drew a letter from the drawer on the table and showed it to me. It was from Zhong Zhicheng, informing the Master that he would arrive in Shanghai after the Double Ninth Festival to seek further instruction. I asked whether the Master had transmitted the complete oral instructions to him. The Master replied: He still lacks the final step, which is why he must come here again to practice.\n\nI then asked about the one surnamed Wang. He sought the Dao all the way to Siam, even more persistently than I did in my early years. He encountered heterodox schools and suffered greatly for it. Later, upon meeting me, he believed in me after just a few words. Knowing he had endured much hardship, I instructed him to practice. He followed me for three months, achieved results, and witnessed great efficacy. This past February, he came to Shanghai again to practice, staying at an inn and visiting me every one or two days. His practice was excellent. He told me his grandfather had devoted his life to the Dao but passed away without encountering a true teacher, leaving behind many Daoist texts in his family. Wang himself had passed the military imperial examination and was assigned to a minor official post in the capital. He said to his father: Our family already has considerable wealth; if nothing unforeseen occurs, even a lifetime of idleness would not exhaust it. I am content and truly have no desire to serve as an official. I often think of my grandfather, who sought the Dao his whole life without success. I, too, am drawn to the Dao, and if I cannot attain it, I secretly wish to carry on his legacy—traveling to the Four Sacred Mountains and major cities across the provinces to seek out accomplished masters. If, by chance, I encounter one, then to perfect myself and others would be a great merit indeed. His father replied: This is a fine endeavor. If you can find the Dao, you will fulfill your grandfather’s aspirations. I will allow you to seek it, and if you succeed, you must tell me. Thus, he traveled throughout China and even to foreign lands like Siam.\n\nThe Master said: Few at my place are willing to exert such relentless effort. The last time you met Cai Fuyang, he also assisted me greatly. In Shanghai, I rely entirely on the two great pillars, Cai and Zhong; without them, I could not have established myself here. How else could I live here with such bold confidence? Cai Fuyang is most eager to help me publish books—he has already contributed five or six hundred yuan for this purpose. When the Republic was founded, I moved here from Hankou, and Cai handled everything: finding a house, arranging the move. Without him, my relocation to Shanghai would not have been so smooth, for I was unfamiliar with the place. With Wang and Zhong, if I had one more powerful supporter, I could leave home entirely—I am quite content as it is.\n\nThe Master recited a poem by Shi Xinglin:\n*\"All things are born and die,\nThe primordial spirit dies and revives.\nWhen the spirit returns within the qi,\nThe elixir path naturally forms.\"*\n\nThe Master said: The method of the elixir is not complex—these words encapsulate it entirely. Whether one attains the Dao depends on fate. In this world, those who achieve the Dao meet one another by karmic affinity; otherwise, one might seek for a lifetime and never encounter a single true teacher.\n\nI said: Though this may be so, those who possess the Dao do not reveal their edges. Without innate wisdom, how can one recognize them? Thus, a true teacher is indeed difficult to find. The Master nodded in agreement.\n\nAfter a pause, he continued: Now that you understand the emptiness of external appearances, when you next encounter a teacher, you will have confidence and will no longer be misled by blind masters. You must know that most who attained the Dao in ancient times did not receive transmission from a single teacher. Take Lü Chunyang, for example: he was taught by Shi Hufu, Ma Ziran, and Zhongli Quanyang. At the time, he received only a single oral instruction from each, and even Zhongli did not transmit the full teaching to him.\n\nHe added: Those who fixate solely on cultivating the physical body are all heterodox and external paths. Ke Huaijing is the same age as I—seventy-eight this year. Ke Zaishu is already over eighty, and Sun Yuanbo is over ninety, nearly a hundred. When I first met him, he was already seventy-six or seventy-seven. Eight years later, I met him again, and he was over eighty.",

Only the *Preface to the Awakening to Reality* was missing; the rest was complete. This must have been printed from a collector’s copy.\n\n\"You may also buy a copy to read,\" I said.\n\nThe Master then retrieved his old copy of *Nanhua Fumo* to show us. Its format was smaller than the edition Meng had purchased, and the printing was far inferior.\n\nI said, \"Meng mentioned that *Nanhua Fumo* is also available in Beijing.\"\n\nThe Master replied, \"I will have you write a letter to Meng, asking him to purchase it for me. Whatever the price, have him send it to me, and I will reimburse him. Many seek this book—I have a disciple who has also asked me to find a copy for him.\n\nRefining the self and laying the foundation are not merely about quietude and sealing essence. If quietude were the Dao, why not speak of refining the heart instead of refining the self? If sealing essence were the Dao, why not speak of refining the kidneys instead of laying the foundation? Refining the self and laying the foundation are two in one, one in two.\n\nFrom the perspective of the primordial, it is simply a matter of heart and breath depending on each other—nothing more. The difficulty lies solely in the first step of refining the self; all subsequent efforts are easy. Only the beginning is hard.\"\n\nHis words were earnest, as if urging us to advance with all haste.\n\nWhen I had previously encountered Master Wu aboard a foreign ship, his spirit was radiant, unlike that of ordinary men.

      "translated_text": "I truly wished to give it to you. I wear purple-flowered cloth socks and a dark-blue robe—this *magua* does not match, and wearing it would only invite ridicule. So I no longer want it and offer it to you as a keepsake.\n\nI said, \"I already have one of my own. Why would I need yours? Please keep it for yourself.\"\n\nMaster Wu was carefree in spirit and magnanimous in heart. Though stern in daily conduct, he would sometimes jest and laugh with us. Over the matter of donating five hundred yuan for famine relief, I unexpectedly gained a sky-blue *magua*—such was the delightful exchange between master and disciple.\n\nOn \"renewing the people\" and \"loving the people\":\nThe Master said, \"Renewing the people pertains to the work of *xing* (nature), while loving the people pertains to the work of *ming* (destiny). This follows the *Yijing*’s ‘Clouds follow the dragon, wind follows the tiger,’ and ‘That which is rooted in Heaven inclines upward, that which is rooted in Earth inclines downward.’ Zhu Xi did not understand and altered it to ‘renewing the people.’ While ‘renewing the people’ is not entirely amiss, Zhu Xi did not grasp what ‘loving’ truly meant. His arbitrary emendation was thus a transgression. How could one renew the people below without first loving those above? Without this foundation, renewal below lacks any basis.\"\n\nHe continued, \"‘Renewing the people’ corresponds to the *Cantong Qi*’s lines: ‘Weed out the old filth, and all things flow smoothly in fine order.’ This is the transformation of the old and establishment of the new—it is the work of *xing*. As for ‘loving the people,’ it is the external harmony of heart and breath, the union of spirit and *qi*. In essence, it is the mutual affinity of like kind. Both the *Cantong Qi* and *Wuzhen Pian* derive from the *Yijing*.\"\n\n\"In learning the Dao, one must ultimately reach the state of ‘no knowledge, no perception.’ At present, when I practice, I can become muddled and unaware, knowing nothing. But when I am not practicing, I cannot maintain this state. If one could remain muddled and unaware even when not practicing, one would return to the state of a child. Yet even this stage is not easily attained—I have toiled painstakingly to reach it.\"\n\n\"Zhu Yuanyu’s *Cantong Qi Chanyou* represents the pinnacle of understanding and is worth studying. The *Bai Zi Bei Zhu* in *Fanghu Waishi* is also excellent, as is the commentary on the *Yinfu Jing*—all are worth reading. To distinguish between the precelestial and postcelestial, the *Xinyin Jing Ceshu* is superb and must be read thoroughly. Study the *Xuanyao*, and you will attain great awakening and realization.\"\n\nHe added, \"You must thoroughly investigate the boundary between the precelestial and postcelestial until your mind is free of doubt. Then, when practicing, you will never become attached to appearances.\"\n\nHe also said, \"When reading, always seek the subtle signs in the void beyond the body. Do not force guesses or blind groping in the postcelestial physical form—this will save you effort. The signs in the void grow ever more profound and intriguing the deeper you explore.\"\n\n\"Read the formless texts day after day, again and again. Over time, you must empty the heart, leaving the mind unbound, free of the slightest attachment, all worries dissolved, not a speck of dust clinging. Abide in emptiness all day, without a single thought arising—only then will you be close. Afterward, when I speak with you of profound matters, you will naturally awaken. What the ancients called ‘instant enlightenment upon a word’ comes from long accumulation. One day, when the master points the way, sudden clarity dawns. This is what it means to practice and awaken simultaneously—progress is swift.\"\n\n\"When I have no other affairs, I only study the *Yijing*. After one reading, I found some evidence to refute Zhu Xi. After another, I discovered more. Thus, my yet-unpublished *Jindan Xuanyao* has grown by over two thousand characters compared to the printed version. Eventually, I must carve a woodblock for it.\"\n\nHe continued, \"To refute Zhu Xi as an outsider, you must cite the *Yijing* as evidence. The *Yijing* is a book authored by the Four Sages. Only with this proof can you overpower Zhu Xi’s convictions; otherwise, your argument will not strike the mark. This is why I study the *Yijing* daily. Without relentless effort, one can never reach the goal. Though attaining the Dao is difficult, it is ultimately achievable by human effort. As Laozi said, ‘A nine-story terrace begins with a mound of earth; a thousand-mile journey starts with a single step; a tree that fills one’s embrace grows from a tiny sprout.’\"\n\n\"Learning the Dao is simply a matter of transformation. Good alchemical texts require few words. Observe the *Ruyao Jing*—in just a few hundred characters, it encompasses the entire beginning and end of the Dao. The opening four lines are the most concise, yet they say it all.\"\n\nI asked, \"Where do immortals reside?\"\nThe Master replied, \"In the single point of numinous *qi* within the void. When still, it is spiritually luminous without bounds; when in motion, its divine power is infinite.\"\n\nI asked, \"When the Earth is destroyed, will the dharmakāya cultivated by immortals also perish?\"\nThe Master said, \"This depends on your practice. If you reach the utmost state of returning to the void and merge with the Dao, you will transcend the creation and transformation of Heaven and Earth, beyond decay and destruction, existing alone and unchanging—how could it perish? If you only practice stillness, you will fall into dead emptiness. Thus, to instantly empty the heart, you must rely on external forms.\"\n\nHe added, \"After all, the work of *xing* is not particularly valuable. The Buddhists have a few lines that express it well: ‘True emptiness does not obstruct wondrous existence; wondrous existence does not obstruct true emptiness,’ and so on.\"\n\n\"During the late Qing, one could not utter a single word against Zhu Xi. If you did, people would condemn you.\"",

      "translated_text": "Breathing with effort is the martial fire; breathless absorption is the civil fire; within absorption, entering the state of forgetting marks the cessation of fire. *Journey to the West* is far too prolix—even after forty readings, one still fails to grasp the apertures, and enlightenment comes with great difficulty. Thus, it is better to read *The Mysterious Essentials of the Golden Elixir*.\n\nSince antiquity, works that establish a distinct school have been exceedingly rare. Let me attempt to name them: *The Yin Talisman*, the *Dao De Jing*, *The Southern Florescence*, *The Vital Axis*, *The Master Who Embraces Simplicity*, *Journey to the West*, and *The Mirror for Compounding the Medicine*—only these few. Though *The Seal of Unity* is excellent, it ultimately remains a restatement of the *Book of Changes* and does not constitute a distinct school.\n\nMy *Mysterious Essentials* focuses solely on the fluctuations of emptiness, taking no images as its basis. It differs greatly from the works of the various perfected ones since the Tang and Song dynasties, for it opens a new path. My aim, after all, is to establish a distinct school.\n\n*The Pointers on Nature and Life* relies on images and is not worth reading. Ke Huaijing’s *Cultivating Nature* and my own *Essentials of Nature and Life* both employ images and are likewise unworthy of study.\n\nHe further said: When I first began writing, Master Ke told me, \"I have read few alchemical texts and have little substance in my belly, so my writing cannot avoid relying on images. You, elder brother, have read widely and have much substance within. I urge you to compose a work without images.\" I replied, \"A work without images is difficult to write, and my literary skill is not equal to yours.\" Master Ke said, \"This is not a matter of literary skill. Plain speech is fine, so long as it is clear and comprehensible.\"\n\nYour static practice lacks foundation, which is why your progress stagnates. Now, hasten to apply yourself to static practice—like a dullard sitting motionless in a chair, unmoving and unshaken, like a corpse, releasing the spirit outward. If stray thoughts arise, notice and dispel them at once. Strive to maintain a state of no-thought; if you can drift into sleep, all the better.\n\nI asked, \"What if stray thoughts cannot be fully dispelled?\"\n\nThe Master replied sternly, \"Only the utmost sincerity in the world can effect transformation. Without sincerity, there is nothing.\"\n\nI was thus enlightened.\n\nReleasing the spirit outward in static practice is a method used by the ancients in old age, when essence is withered and spirit is dull, to nourish the spirit. For young cultivators of the Dao, this practice is unnecessary, though engaging in it occasionally may still be beneficial.\n\nHe further said: If one persists in this static practice without interruption for many years, one may live to be over a hundred. Thus, the value of the Dao is beyond words.\n\nIn discussing *Journey to the West*, he spoke of the Tang Monk, Wukong, and Bajie traveling together. The Tang Monk instructed Wukong to expound the *Heart Sutra*, but Wukong remained silent. After a long while, Bajie grew restless and said, \"This monkey is always up to mischief, playing tricks. He claims to know the *Heart Sutra*, yet when the master orders him to speak, he says nothing. Clearly, he doesn’t understand and is pretending to be enlightened to deceive the master. Speak at once!\"\n\nWukong still said nothing. The fool then caused a great uproar.\n\nWukong had already spoken.\n\nAs the ancients said, \"The Great Dao transcends words.\" The Buddha-dharma also states: \"The teaching that does not speak is the true teaching. I have already understood.\"\n\nThe Master said: Such passages in *Journey to the West* are truly excellent, yet people fail to pay attention. Thus, the Great Dao of the Golden Elixir cannot be captured by brush or ink, nor even expressed in speech. As Master Yuchan said, \"The wonder of the moment lies in mind-to-mind transmission.\" Confucius also said, \"I wish to speak no more.\" All these point to the same truth.\n\nHe then discussed the episode of Bottomless Cave in Mount Void-Trap. The Master said: This illustrates how those who enter heterodox paths, focusing solely on cultivating their own nature, fall into the abyss of emptiness and cannot escape in a lifetime. Wukong said, \"I have fought thousands upon thousands of battles, yet I have never seen such a cave. Why is it so dark and bottomless?\" He then ordered Bajie to test it first. The pig shook his head and said, \"My body is heavy as a rammer. If I step into such a cave, it would take two or three years just to reach the bottom!\"\n\nThe Master said: Such writing awakens many. Thus, a single misstep into heterodox paths leaves one in eternal darkness, making it difficult to behold the light.",

      "original_text": "又里面三百八十四间屋，此又是法《易经》三百八十四爻，而无底洞又可作先天无极讲矣，与崆峒山一般，此即先天后天都可讲，所以《西游》难看，变不尽变，化不尽化也。 少年难下功，因气血刚，意气锐，万事精进猛利，你知道锋芒利多少，所以不能做功。 须得锐角磨圆，有暇静玩《参同》、《道德》、《阴符》，到心平气和，即不难下手矣。 无象之书，读得熟是有用的。 有象之书，万不可看。 转生灭流动而为寂灭不动，是出世之梯航。 就目前而论，呼吸之出入，心念之起灭，熟非流动之象，要转得才好。 举僧璨《信心铭》曰：“一心不生，万法无咎”。 关尹子曰：“一息不存，道将来契”。 师曰：言心言息，总以前后际断，寂灭不生为归。 性宗命蒂，胥在于是矣。 不存谓不存在，即是凡息断，泰然入定。 于此定中，先天元神和元炁自来。 故曰，道将来契也。 身心俱寂，造化其奈我何。 举吕祖曰：“内丹成，外丹就，内外相接好延寿，结成一块紫金花，飞腾天地外”。 师曰：学者炼己功纯，胸无尘念，观景无心，寂然不动，即性定，内丹成也。 所以然者，由于我天天遣进一分先天，伏我后天妄动之心。 久久妄尽归源，如如不动，中宫虚静，如月朗中天，即到家矣。 然后可以炼九还。 九者阳数，即定中真阳，自虚无中来，谓之金华，又谓之外药。 外丹者，谓其从外而来，非我色身所固有也。 《参同契》曰：“金来归性初，乃得称还丹”。 金即先天炁也，谓之妙有。 性初即真空元性也，谓之妙有。 丹经喻之谓为真铅真汞，譬之谓婴儿姹女。 总之是以妙有之炁，合我真空之性耳。 外内相接，空有融和，又喻之谓刀圭，名之还丹，紫金丸，又还丹之别名也。 名相纷繁，悟之则惟简惟易，执之则愈烦愈难，所以必须从师参学。 问《仙佛合宗语录》，引王玉阳诗“一悟真空总了仙，如何悟去如何了”。 都请开示。 师曰：此部工夫尚早，目前你总只要修到“杳杳冥冥生恍惚，恍恍惚惚结成团”，已够了。 次日复问。 师曰：内证真空，一念不起。 紫阳云：“夜深月正明，天地一轮镜”，是即性初，是真如妙性也。 外亦成真空，呼吸断绝，寂然不动。 如是内外皆证真空之境，混而为一。 内成七返，外成九还。 紫阳所谓：“内药还同外药，内通外亦须通”也。 总要修到内外成两空，混而为一，自然悟去矣。 余惧师隐后弃我等，因以问师。 师曰：你等放心，余总不使你们落空。 余隐总致信与汝等。 你等可与我每年通信二三次，也不用多，庶几余可知你等住址，将来可嘱小儿关照也。 余问谈道会之八人，除老师和柯怀经先生得吴师传后，其余六人，老师与柯师伯曾传授他们否。 师曰：那自然。 吴老师命我二人转传他们的。 余曰：亦皆得道否。 师叹曰：言之伤心。 除了一个柯载书，余都死完了。 余大骇，请问其故。 师曰：当时我等八人结一谈道会，租定某茶馆内一间屋为会所，天天谈道，讲得高兴。 虽曰八人，其中真正坚心学道的，只有五人，即我与柯怀经兄弟及曾某与周季昌，其余不过好道，谈谈而已。 余问季云岚如何。 师曰：他也在八人之内，得气喘病，以后就死了。 余问姓曾如何。 师曰：他与周季昌工夫都做得很好，但以后曾君应友人之招，赴某会馆饮酒，未及回而家中失火，曾君得知，忙即回家，奈街上人已冲塞，有看火烧的，有劫火场的，曾君见火心急，欲一瞻其家小，死力挤进去。",
      "translated_text": "The three hundred and eighty-four chambers within further correspond to the three hundred and eighty-four lines of the *Yijing*, while the Bottomless Cave may also be interpreted as the Primordial Limitless. Like Mount Kongtong, it admits both precelestial and postcelestial readings—hence the *Journey to the West* is difficult to fathom, for its transformations are inexhaustible and its metamorphoses boundless.\n\nIn youth, one finds it hard to apply effort, for the qi and blood are vigorous, the will and spirit sharp, and all undertakings pursued with fierce intensity. How much of this edge is truly beneficial? Thus, one cannot yet engage in practice. Only when the sharp angles have been worn smooth, when one has leisure to quietly contemplate the *Cantong qi*, the *Daode jing*, and the *Yinfu jing*, and when the heart is at peace and the qi harmonized, does it become easy to begin.\n\nBooks without form, once thoroughly studied, prove useful. Books with form must never be read.\n\nTo turn the flowing and shifting of birth-and-death into the stillness of quiescent extinction is the ladder to transcendence. Even in the present moment, the ebb and flow of breath, the arising and ceasing of thoughts—are these not all manifestations of flux? One must learn to transform them.\n\nMaster Sengcan’s *Xinxin ming* says: “When the One Mind does not arise, the myriad dharmas are without fault.”\nGuan Yinzi says: “When a single breath does not remain, the Dao will come to meet you.”\n\nThe Master said: Whether speaking of mind or breath, the goal is to sever past and future, to rest in quiescence and non-arising. Both the root of nature and the stem of life depend on this.\n\n“Does not remain” means the cessation of ordinary breath, the tranquil entry into samadhi. Within this samadhi, the precelestial original spirit and original qi naturally arrive. Hence it is said, “the Dao will come to meet you.”\n\nWhen body and mind are both stilled, what can the workings of creation do to me?\n\nThe Master cited Lü Zu’s words: “When the inner elixir is complete, the outer elixir forms. Inner and outer join, prolonging life. A purple-golden flower coalesces, soaring beyond heaven and earth.”\n\nThe Master said: When a practitioner’s refinement of the self is pure, the breast free of worldly thoughts, and the contemplation of phenomena without attachment—when one rests in utter stillness—this is the stabilization of nature, the completion of the inner elixir. The reason lies in daily relinquishing a portion of the precelestial to subdue the postcelestial mind’s delusive movements. Over time, delusion is exhausted and returns to the source, abiding in unshakable stillness. The Central Palace becomes empty and serene, like the moon shining in mid-heaven—this is arriving home. Only then can one refine the Nine Returns.\n\nNine is the yang number, the true yang that arises from quiescent emptiness in samadhi. This is called the Golden Flower, or the external medicine. The “external elixir” refers to its coming from without, not being inherently part of the physical body. The *Cantong qi* says: “When metal returns to the initial nature, it may be called the Returned Elixir.” Metal is the precelestial qi, termed wondrous existence. The “initial nature” is the true emptiness of original nature, also termed wondrous existence. Alchemical classics compare it to true lead and true mercury, or to the infant boy and the maiden girl. In essence, it is the union of the qi of wondrous existence with one’s true empty nature. When inner and outer join, emptiness and existence merge, likened to the medicinal spoon, named the Returned Elixir, the Purple-Golden Pill—another name for the Returned Elixir.\n\nNames and metaphors abound, but in awakening, all is simple and easy. Clinging to them only breeds greater complexity and difficulty, so one must seek instruction from a teacher.\n\nA question was raised regarding the *Record of the Unity of Immortals and Buddhas*, which cites Wang Yuyang’s poem: “One awakening to true emptiness completes the immortal’s path—how to awaken, how to complete?” The disciple asked for elucidation.\n\nThe Master said: This level of practice is still premature. For now, strive only to reach the state described as “dim and obscure, giving rise to the indistinct; from the indistinct, coalescing into a mass.” That will suffice.\n\nThe next day, the question was raised again.\n\nThe Master said: Internally, realize true emptiness, where not a single thought arises. As Master Ziyang said: “Deep in the night, the moon shines bright—heaven and earth, one mirror.” This is the initial nature, the wondrous nature of true suchness. Externally, true emptiness is also realized, with breath suspended and utter stillness. When both inner and outer attain the realm of true emptiness, they merge as one. Internally, the Seven Returns are accomplished; externally, the Nine Returns. As Ziyang said: “The inner medicine is like the outer; when the inner flows, the outer must also flow.” The key is to cultivate until inner and outer become two emptinesses, merging into one—then awakening naturally follows.\n\nFearing the Master’s impending seclusion would leave them adrift, the disciples asked for reassurance.\n\nThe Master said: Rest easy. I will not abandon you. When I withdraw, I will send word to you all. You may write to me two or three times a year—no need for more—so I may know your whereabouts and instruct my sons to look after you.\n\nThe disciple asked about the eight members of the Talks on the Dao Society, noting that aside from the Master and Elder Ke Huaijing, who had received transmission from Master Wu, the remaining six had been taught by the Master and Elder Ke.\n\nThe Master said: Of course. Master Wu instructed us two to transmit to them.\n\nThe disciple asked: Have they all attained the Dao?\n\nThe Master sighed: It is painful to speak of. Only Ke Zaishu remains; the rest have all passed away.\n\nShocked, the disciple asked the reason.\n\nThe Master said: At the time, the eight of us formed the Talks on the Dao Society and rented a room in a certain teahouse as our meeting place. We discussed the Dao daily, speaking with great enthusiasm. Though there were eight, only five were truly resolute in their pursuit of the Dao—myself, the Ke brothers, Zeng, and Zhou Jichang. The others merely had an affinity for the Dao and enjoyed discussing it.\n\nThe disciple asked about Ji Yunlan.\n\nThe Master said: He was among the eight, but later developed asthma and died.\n\nThe disciple asked about the one surnamed Zeng.\n\nThe Master said: He and Zhou Jichang had both made excellent progress. Later, Zeng was invited by a friend to a gathering at a certain guild hall. Before he could return, his home caught fire. Learning of it, he hurried back, but the streets were already choked with people—some watching the fire, others looting the scene. Anxious to check on his family, he forced his way through the crowd and perished.",

Why is it so dark and bottomless?\" He then ordered Bajie to test it first. The pig shook his head and said, \"My body is heavy as a rammer. If I step into such a cave, it would take two or three years just to reach the bottom!\"\n\nThe Master said: Such writing awakens many. Thus, a single misstep into heterodox paths leaves one in eternal darkness, making it difficult to behold the light.",

      "translated_text": "Though the crowd numbered in the thousands, once he forced his way in, his strength was spent—he could no longer push his way out. Trapped amid the throng, his feet still touching the ground, he was crushed from all sides by the press of bodies until he was broken. Later, he coughed up blood and died.\n\nThe disciple asked: Zhou Jichang had made such fine progress—why did he also die?\n\nThe Master said: That was his own undoing. He became entangled in some dispute and took it to court. When he lost the case, he was confined in the lockup for months. The frustration and distress left him unable to continue his practice, and he too succumbed to a fatal coughing sickness. (Note: The misfortunes that befell both Zeng and Zhou were demonic obstructions.)\n\nLater, only Ke Zaishu remained steadfast in his pursuit, applying himself with unrelenting effort. Of the eight, only the Master and the Ke brothers endured.\n\nThe disciple sighed deeply.\n\nThe Master continued: At that time, there were many fellow Dao-seekers in Hankou. Though the discussion group was formed by eight, there were others who did not join but came daily to the teahouse meeting place to speak of the Way. If you read Ke Huaijing’s *Nurturing Inner Nature*, you will see how many Dao-friends there were.

      "translated_text": "If one’s daily practice has deep roots, even should one contract the blood-spitting illness, it is of no great concern. Thus *The Pointers to Nature and Life* says: “Entering the Dao is easy; guarding the Dao is hard”—not a whit in error. Again it is said: One must never interrupt one’s practice. If each day one devotes two or three hours to it, no illness, however severe, need be feared. Had I not applied myself thus, I would have died many times over. Hence the saying of Master Ziyang: “Only then did I know my fate was not ruled by Heaven.”\n\nThe Master continued: I met Sun Yuanbo later. He was a *juren* of the *jiazi* year. As for Master Wu, he spoke only a few words of *Journey to the West* when we first met, and afterward never discussed alchemical texts at all. On the very first day, he told us: “I have come here to transmit to you the oral instructions, not the books; to teach you how to practice, not how to expound the scriptures.” Sometimes Ke Huaijing and I would go to ask him about alchemical texts. Master Wu would reply: “Go and do the work first, then come back.” What could we do?\n\nAgain he said: Master Wu was not one for idle talk. After transmitting to us a few oral instructions, he would tell us to apply ourselves wholeheartedly to the practice. Only when we had reached that stage would he explain the finer points. If our practice had not yet reached the required level and we asked for further instructions, he would say: “Your practice has not yet reached that point. When it does, I will tell you.” We had no choice but to devote ourselves single-mindedly to the work.\n\nThe Master said: What I told you earlier were things I heard from heterodox and external schools. After meeting Master Wu, everything changed. Master Wu was truly formidable. On the second and third days after his arrival in Hankou, all the Dao-friends came to pay their respects and ask him questions. We were left speechless, staring blankly at one another like fools—completely different from the people we had met before. I asked the Grand Master Wu how he expounded the Dao. He did not discuss scriptures with you. All his questions concerned the precelestial; there was nothing about the postcelestial or the physical body. How were we to answer him? When one of the eight came to pay his respects, having completed the formalities, Master Wu would ask: “You too seek the Dao?” The disciple would say yes.

They are but metaphors, traps, and snares.”\n\nAnother disciple came to pay his respects. After the formalities, Master Wu asked, “You too seek the Dao?” He answered yes. Master Wu then said, “If you have pursued the Dao for many years, do you know whether the Great Dao is precelestial or postcelestial?” The disciple replied, “It is precelestial.” Master Wu asked, “Then why does it become postcelestial?” The disciple said, “Because the body is broken.” Master Wu asked, “In that case, where has your precelestial gone?” The disciple was left speechless.\n\nKe Huaijing then interjected, “It has transformed.” Master Wu asked him, “Transformed into what?” Lord Ke, too, fell silent. I then said, “Once transformed, it scatters.” Master Wu asked, “Scatters where?” I, too, was left speechless. We all stared blankly at one another.\n\nMaster Wu then said, “It is like one who has lost something: to recover it, you must search where it was lost to return to the original state. If you lose a few silver coins on the street, you must look for them on the street; if you lose them in a shop, you must search that shop. Looking elsewhere would be labor in vain.”\n\nThe Master said, “In my *Three Teachings Harmonized*, several passages record Master Wu’s words.”\n\nAfter a few more days, Master Wu gathered us eight disciples and declared, “My energy is limited. I can only transmit the teachings to two of you. The remaining six may receive them later from these two—it will be as if I had taught you myself.” We all replied that we would abide by his choice. Master Wu said, “It is up to you; to me, you are all the same. You yourselves know best which two have studied the alchemical texts most deeply and mastered their principles.” Thus, he transmitted the teachings to Ke Huaijing and me.\n\nI asked about the other six. The Master said, “When they later encounter a true teacher, they will no longer study the Dao. They often say, ‘Once our family affairs are settled, we will follow you into seclusion. You two will be our teachers.’ But how could they wait for that?”\n\nChongxuzi said, *“Of old, a thousand sages were enlightened by breath—*\n*Clear inhalation and exhalation made them immortals.”*\nSuch words are truly deadly. They are no different from Muyuanzi’s *“When external yang stirs, it is the living midnight of the body.”* Once people read these lines, they begin manipulating their breath, fall into the postcelestial, cling to form, and stir the fire—illness is inevitable.\n\n(I said, “It should be revised to: *‘True breath made clear, one becomes immortal’*—only then does it accord with the profound mechanism.)\n\nI asked, “Baopuzi says, ‘Those who attain the Dao have square pupils.’ Is this true?” The Master replied, “It is.” I asked, “Why?”",

      "translated_text": "The Master said, “It is the spirit that is numinous.”\n\nI asked about the *suozi* bones? The Master said, “The bones interlock like hooks and locks—this too is an auspicious sign of those who have attained the Dao.”\n\nCai Fuyang has assisted me greatly, yet he refuses to devote himself to practice. He says, “Let me settle my affairs first, then I will follow you to cultivate.” But this year has its affairs, and next year will have its own—who knows when his matters will ever be complete? In my view, only death brings completion; as long as one lives, affairs never end. Hearing this, I was deeply moved.\n\nPeople often say, “If immortality can be learned, why do we not see immortals in the world? It must be a deception, not worth believing.” This is a grave error. For when the principle remains unexhausted, the mind remains benighted, and one follows the common view. Yet the immortal is transformation. When a fish transforms into a dragon, it soars into the heavens and never returns to the water. Or take the water insects—hundreds swimming in the river—when one day they become mosquitoes, they ascend into the air and never return to the water. The immortal is no different. Once a person’s form is transformed into an immortal, they ride dragons and mount phoenixes, roaming the six directions, never again entering the turbid world to endure its filth. Why must they display supernatural powers or wield magical arts to convince the unbelieving?\n\nLong ago, when I first met Master Wu, he first instructed me to practice stillness for a month, then to listen to my breath with my ears. Little did I know that I would clench too tightly. Master Wu said, “Do not clench—this must never be forced. To clench is to cling to form, to fall into the postcelestial.” So I relaxed, but then fell into emptiness. Master Wu again said, “You cannot fall into emptiness. You must faintly perceive its coming and going, without attachment, letting it follow its nature.” Only then did I gradually grow adept.\n\nThe Master said, “Falling into emptiness merely yields no effect, but clinging to form will surely cause illness. If you can regulate it evenly, neither forgetting nor forcing, then it is balanced—ordinary breath naturally grows faint while true breath emerges. This is the true bellows, the true crucible and furnace.”\n\nHe further said, “When heart and breath align externally, the crucible and furnace are instantly established.”\n\nThe practice is transmitted in three stages. The first is refining the self and laying the foundation—what I have already explained to you. The second encompasses the firing times and transformations, including the minor celestial cycle, gathering the great medicine, passing the gates, and returning to the youthful body. The third is the final work of inherent nature—matters such as spirit departing the body and returning to emptiness, which is the completion of the Dao.\n\nWhen Meng Jun first wrote to me, he spoke of practicing the solar qi-refining method for ten years, exaggerating its merits. The Master said, “It is all misguided—why write about such things? You’ve practiced for ten years, yet you still leak essence. What kind of practice is that?” That is why I did not reply. Yet he writes again and again. I truly do not understand—how can a person be so muddled? He is pitiable, and I am vexed by him.",

      "translated_text": "I said, \"To be so muddled—this is also his virtue.\" Had I wished to be so muddled, I could not have achieved it. The Master laughed.\n\nHe then said, \"Old Meng is truly sincere, but he lacks adaptability. He has sent countless letters, all asking about mere words and images, and his questions never stray from the five detailed texts: *The Golden Immortal’s Verification of the Dao*, *The Sutra of the Wisdom-Life*, *The True Principle of Heavenly Immortality*, *The Unity of Immortals and Buddhas*, and *The Pointers on Nature and Life*. If I did not reply, he would suspect I did not understand the alchemical classics, so I had no choice but to explain in detail and instruct him not to cling to words or images. Yet he sees as if he does not see, persistently asking the same questions again and again, leaving me no peace. Later, I told him plainly that if he continued to ask the same old questions, I would not reply at all. Had I not said this, he would not have stopped. I had no other recourse but to be blunt with him.\"\n\nThe Master added, \"Fortunately, there is only one such person. If there were two or three, I would have no time left for my own practice. As for the solar qi-refining method, I once explained it to you—it is but an image. In essence, it is the interdependence of heart and breath, the unity of spirit and qi externally, with the heart as emptiness. When the heart is empty, its light shines downward like the sun illuminating all things, which the alchemical texts call 'turning the light around to reflect.' Since the heart’s light no longer flares upward but shines downward, the kidney-water naturally transforms into qi and rises, and the postnatal heart and kidneys spontaneously merge. Once heart and kidneys unite, the kidney-water no longer leaks, hence the saying: 'The solar qi-refining method governs men.' Beyond the interdependence of heart and breath, what else is there to the solar qi-refining method? Those of heterodox schools, failing to grasp this, cling to it and establish their own sects. Women belong to *kun*, so it is called lunar form-refining—yet is it not also the interdependence of heart and breath?\"\n\nI said, \"I heard Meng speak of the solar qi-refining method requiring wooden, stone, or iron mallets to strike along the body’s meridians.\"\n\nThe Master’s expression changed. \"How cruel! This is why the ancient immortals said, 'Seek the Dao among humanity.' They deeply despised such heterodox practices, which are inhuman and devoid of humaneness. Consider this: if the interdependence of heart and breath alone suffices to complete the Dao, why use wooden or iron mallets to strike the body? I have traveled everywhere in search of the Dao and seen all manner of strange things—most practitioners cling to one technique or method to astonish the common folk and dazzle with wonders. Yet when examined in truth, these have no relation to body, heart, nature, or life.\"\n\nThe Master then spoke of the \"true seed.\" \"The seed is that upon which all things depend for nurture and generation. As Lü Dongbin said, 'Heaven and earth cannot give birth to the myriad things; emptiness gives birth to heaven and earth.' Emptiness leaves no trace, yet it deeply embodies the nature of all things, and thus it can give birth to them. This emptiness is the true seed. Within emptiness, there is non-emptiness—a qi that flows without trace, hence the 'true seed.' The true seed is distinguished from the ordinary seed. As Zhang Sanfeng said, 'Seek the true seed where lightning flashes; find the original lineage when the wind’s signal comes.' The flash of lightning and the coming of the wind’s signal are the phenomena and signs of the stirring of the primal yang. The moment I perceive it, I swiftly act externally—is this not the true seed? The original lineage is emptiness.\n\n\"When you return home this time, apply yourself diligently. During practice, never close your eyes—keep them open. Regardless of distance, fix your gaze on one object or place, neither clinging nor departing. After a while, you need only faintly know that you are focused externally—this is the interdependence. Neither falling into emptiness nor attaching to form, muddled yet with all thoughts dissolved, drifting as if floating, seemingly present yet absent, in a moment of vagueness and obscurity, the external yang stirs. The instant you perceive it, swiftly turn to the interdependence of heart and breath externally—do not delay. The slightest delay turns the primal into the postnatal. If you then attach to the body, there is the danger of leaking essence, and all is lost. This arising of yang is the postnatal’s primal. The moment you perceive it is also the postnatal’s primal. You must again practice the interdependence.\n\n\"Depend until you reach the state of vagueness and obscurity, then profound stillness. With prolonged stillness, internal and external merge, movement and stillness both vanish, self and form forgotten, unaware and unknowing—this is the extreme of emptiness and the depth of quiescence, the entire body numb. With further stillness, the body inside and out pulses as one. Any illness, once this stage is reached, will be entirely cured. Not only will illness be cured, but the postnatal physical body’s yang will also arise.\"\n\nThe Master said, \"At this stage of extreme emptiness and profound stillness, both inside and outside the body are primal. You are like a living corpse. If primal qi arrives, your heart does not stir in the slightest, yet your spirit naturally goes outward to depend on the breath, without the slightest intention or force intervening—this is called natural mastery. This is the primal’s primal. Again, externally interdepend, and once more reach the state of vagueness and obscurity. With prolonged stillness, profound tranquility returns, and again internal and external merge, all a thousand miles clear, the entire body numb, the entire body pulsing.\"",

      "translated_text": "As long as you enter the state of vagueness and obscurity three or four times a day, you will be free from illness all year round—this is the secret to preserving the body.\n\nIn the past, when Confucius was about to depart, Laozi said to him, \"The noble one bestows words as gifts, while the petty one offers material goods.\" Now, I too embody this sentiment, presenting these teachings as a parting gift to you both.\n\nThis time, I accompanied Master Tang to visit the teacher and receive instruction. The practice of \"heart and breath interdepending\" may seem utterly ordinary when spoken aloud, so most people dismiss it as tasteless and abandon it. Yet who knows that within this tastelessness lies the most profound flavor?\n\nWhen asked how to close the \"Gate of Yang,\" the Master replied: If you can enter the state of vagueness and obscurity at any time, it will close of itself without your seeking to close it.\n\nThe Master sighed deeply and said: Those who have not obtained the method seek the method, while those who have obtained it become obsessed with reading books instead of practicing—what benefit is there in this? Therefore, you must devote yourselves to practice. All alchemical texts can be set aside entirely; do not waste your energy studying them. This is the unvarnished truth.\n\nPlants and trees return to their roots in winter, sprouting anew the following year, and returning to their roots again the next winter—thus they endure. Most people meet their end because they cannot return to their roots like plants and trees. The method of \"heart and breath interdepending\" that I teach you is the way of returning to the root.\n\nReturning to the root means the spirit and qi return to their source, neither issuing forth nor entering in—just as the leaves of plants and trees fall in the depths of winter. If you can return to the root, when the first yang revives, you will restore your mandate. Returning to the root is the great stillness, where body and mind are both quiescent, the ordinary breath dissolves, and the alchemical classics call this \"embracing the primordial in emptiness and peril.\"\n\nThereafter, \"three days after the emergence of geng\" marks the message of reviving the mandate. Returning to the root is the first step of the work. Returning to the state of an infant is the second step. Returning to the Wuji is the third step—this is the initial attainment of stillness. Next, one reverts to the body of a youth, knowing nothing, aware of nothing. In the end, one shatters the void to perceive the entire body.\n\nCultivating the Dao is like eating sugarcane: the closer you get to the root, the sweeter it becomes. It is also like climbing a height: with every foot ascended, the view grows broader.\n\nThis treasure of emptiness is priceless, for no one dares set a value on it. The *Preface to Laozi’s Profound Insight* in *Fanghu Waishi* is excellent, though Zhao’s preface is not.\n\nSomeone asked me to explain the lines, \"Abide in constant non-desire to observe its mystery; abide in constant desire to observe its gateway.\" I did not respond. The Master said: It means \"heart and breath interdepending.\" The spirit is fundamentally non-active, yet the mechanism of qi cannot remain unmoving. It is always the interdependence of being and non-being.\n\nAnother asked about the lines, \"Know the white, guard the black; know the male, guard the female.\" The Master himself explained: These too refer to \"heart and breath interdepending.\"\n\nOf the ten thousand volumes of alchemical texts, only these four characters—\"heart and breath interdepending\"—matter. Hence it is said, \"Ten thousand scrolls of immortal scriptures are unlocked by a single phrase.\" The method my teacher Wu transmitted to me was precisely these four characters. Apart from \"heart and breath interdepending,\" there is not a single word beyond it—thus, \"When the Dao is spoken, it is bland and without flavor.\"\n\nIf you cultivate \"heart and breath interdepending\" to its ultimate point, you will reach the stage of ascension. Most people do not believe this because they know but do not practice, practice but not diligently, or practice diligently but not persistently. With such an approach, how can one hope to become an immortal or patriarch? Though it is but a single phrase of four characters, some spend their entire lives without mastering it—it is truly not easy. Do not underestimate it.\n\nFrom non-being to being, from following emotions to aligning with nature—all are the work of \"heart and breath interdepending.\" The two characters \"refining the self\" are spoken of lightly, but how easy is it? Once the self is refined to perfection, all subsequent work becomes effortless. The difficulty lies precisely in refining the self. The self is one’s own nature.\n\nMaster Meng’s view that \"no-thought\" constitutes refining the self is a grave error. If no-thought were refining the self, why seek a teacher? Because Master Meng remains so muddled even now, I am truly displeased.\n\nThe Master said: In the golden elixir, there is only one practice from beginning to end—refining the self. When this is brought to its ultimate point, one can project the spirit.\n\nI wrote to him with good intentions, saying I would transmit to him the method of refining the self. He replied: \"Refining the self is nothing more than no-thought. I already know this; there is no need for you to repeat it.\" Alas, this is the harm of being too familiar with the books of Wu and Liu. Had I spoken to him of the Greater and Lesser Celestial Cycles, he would have been overjoyed. He even said to me: \"There is no Greater or Lesser Celestial Cycle. These terms were all fabricated by Wu Chongxu.\" As for the Celestial Cycle, the *Xuan Yao* mentions it in seven or eight places.\n\nI asked: \"Last summer, you transmitted to me the method of refining the self. Why are you teaching it again this year?\" The Master replied: \"Last summer’s transmission was incomplete. Now I will teach you the fire phases in detail, until external yang no longer arises—then you will have a firm grasp.\" At that moment, my heart was filled with gratitude beyond words.\n\nA child’s heart and breath naturally interdepend, so they need only still themselves to enter the state of vagueness and obscurity.",

      "translated_text": "For the works of Wu and Liu, I have expended untold ink and breath. Every good alchemical text begins by speaking of the interdependence of heart and breath—eschewing empty talk, rejecting names and forms. It teaches: *\"To cultivate stillness in the Li Palace, one must observe the return; to seek the mysterious in the Water Mansion, one must again observe.\"* The Master said: \"The first line speaks of movement reaching its extreme and turning to stillness—entering the state of vagueness, obscurity, primordial chaos, and emptiness: this is true stillness. The second line speaks of stillness reaching its extreme and turning to movement—revealing the heart of Heaven and Earth, as external yang arises from the midst of emptiness.\"\n\nThe Master asked: \"In monasteries, those who sit in meditation must become like living corpses. We who cultivate the Dao must also become like living corpses.\" I was asked: \"What is the difference between these two kinds of living corpses?\" I had no reply. The Master said: \"Theirs have breath; ours have no breath. Breath belongs to yin; breathlessness belongs to yang. The two are vastly different—do not confuse them as one. What use is 'no-thought'? It is ten thousand miles from the Dao. The *Qingjing Jing* states: *'Those who can awaken to this may transmit the sagely Dao.'* Only when one reaches the state of no-thought may the Dao be transmitted. To take no-thought itself as the Dao is to stray far indeed. Of the ten thousand volumes of alchemical texts, only Laozi’s six characters—*'attain utmost emptiness, guard deep stillness'*—are essential. The Buddhist master Zhi Zhe said: *'If one can sit in stillness and turn the light inward, one will see the old master of one’s former life.'* The Master said: 'If you understand these five characters—*\"sit in stillness and turn the light inward\"*—that is enough. You need not read the ten thousand volumes of alchemical texts.'\"\n\nRefining the self is not the same as no-thought; they are two distinct matters, not one. No-thought inevitably clings to the physical body—either spitting blood or leaking essence, with no hope of escape. These two matters refer to cultivating the Dharma-body while also tending to the physical body, what is called *'Heaven and man unite in arising, the foundation of the myriad transformations is set.'*\n\nThe Master’s daughter-in-law fell ill, as did his granddaughter—both with cold damage. The daughter-in-law’s condition was critical; Western physicians had given up hope, yet she later took a turn for the better and survived. The Master himself fell ill, with wind, cold, water, and dampness all assailing his body. The Western physicians said, given his advanced age, he might not endure. The Master replied: \"I will apply effort. A noble person must attend to the root. The interdependence of heart and breath is the root of curing illness.\" Who could have known that, upon applying effort, his entire body’s joints would feel as if drilled by an awl? For four days and four nights, he finally expelled the wind, cold, water, and dampness from his body. The Master said: \"When illness strikes, the Dao becomes truly valuable.\"\n\nZhen Qing said: \"During a great plague in a certain year of the Guangxu era, the Master also fell ill, growing dizzy and collapsing after every three steps. At that time, his heart and breath remained interdependent, under his control. After three days and nights of effort, he vomited a basin of black blood and recovered. This was another great tribulation—he had endured four or five such crises by then.\" The Master said: \"When illness reaches this stage, even Wu, Liu, and others—at the level they were when writing their books—would have died, with no hope of escape. Not to mention Wu and Liu; even Lu Qianxu, when he wrote the *Fanghu Waishi*, would have perished from such an illness. You praise the *Fanghu Waishi*, yet do you know that the level of skill described in its pages still could not avert death?\" I asked why. The Master said: \"Your own cultivation is shallow, so when you read alchemical texts, you cannot discern the level of skill the authors had attained at the time. I, however, can tell at a glance how far their cultivation had progressed.\"\n\nHe continued: \"Liu Wuyuan had already applied great effort when he wrote his books, placing him far above Lu Qianxu. Yet because he had read few alchemical texts, his writing often lacked substance, verging on empty talk. Still, in every piece, there were one or two uniquely insightful phrases—truly astonishing. This was the fruit of his deep cultivation, beyond the reach of ordinary people.\" The Master once said: \"Wuyuan either says nothing, or when he speaks, it stuns people.\"\n\n\"When Zhu Yuanyu wrote his books, his cultivation had already declined by half—otherwise, he could not have mastered so many alchemical texts. Thus, those who do not relinquish worldly affairs never succeed; those who cling to their homes remain in peril.\"",
      "overlap_context": "I asked: \"Last summer, you transmitted to me the method of refining the self. Why are you teaching it again this year?\" The Master replied: \"Last summer’s transmission was incomplete. Now I will teach you the fire phases in detail, until external yang no longer arises—then you will have a firm grasp.\" At that moment, my heart was filled with gratitude beyond words.\n\nA child’s heart and breath naturally interdepend, so they need only still themselves to enter the state of vagueness and obscurity.",

      "translated_text": "At this moment, we who live in the world are all like rootless trees, drifting with the wind—today unaware of what tomorrow may bring. How can this not strike the heart with alarm?\n\nWhen heart and breath interdepend, each trace of awareness introduces a trace of the postnatal, a trace of failure to attain perfect spontaneity. Only when heart and breath constantly interdepend, always merging as one, does stillness naturally lead into the state of rapt absorption.\n\nThe purpose of our Dao cultivation lies in leaving behind the tangible physical body. Thus, from the very beginning, we must project our spirit beyond the body into the empty void—this is the first step in separating it from the physical form. For each moment the primordial spirit abides steadily in the void, the power to relinquish the physical body grows stronger. In plain terms, its connection to the physical body weakens by that degree. With long and pure practice, the dharmakāya can remain steadily outside, no longer needing this physical form, and becomes entirely separate from it. This is what is called \"shedding the womb.\"\n\nWhen the spirit attains great stillness, the breath ceases to move in and out. Once the spirit is settled outside, detached from this physical body and no longer clinging to it, it becomes purely prenatal. True yang from the void constantly gathers with it, and the dharmakāya gradually grows and becomes more numinous. Over time, it can leave stillness and stand alone, achieve spirit travel—how wondrous!\n\nThe *Xingming Guizhi* states: \"In cultivation, be a guest seeking long life; in refining nature, be like a living corpse.\" The term \"living corpse\" is apt, but one must distinguish carefully. A corpse with breath is purely yin, postnatal—worthless. A \"living corpse\" without breath is purely yang, prenatal—such a one can truly ascend.

      "translated_text": "Thus, whatever is written in books or spoken aloud is never the Dao. If one wishes to personally witness the profound mystery of the void, there is no alternative but to apply oneself to practice. When others cultivate, the moment external yang stirs, they take it as a great sign of efficacy and treasure it—yet this is precisely where leakage occurs. Those who cultivate well experience no stirring of yang. Any stirring of yang arises solely from failing to swiftly detach from the physical body; it is not of the prenatal but has already turned a thought or a clinging to the body into the postnatal. To cling to the postnatal body and thereby provoke the stirring of external yang is to practice incorrectly.\n\nThe Master further said: In the state of extreme emptiness and profound stillness, if external yang stirs slightly, swiftly detach from the body and remain outside, relying on it. With breath entirely stilled, how could yang stir? If it becomes firm and erect, the matter is already spoiled. Thus, one must act before it stirs—this fleeting moment of subtle application is also called \"encounter within the flickering and indistinct.\"\n\nThe Master further said: All who cultivate to the point of external yang stirring are clinging to the physical body, mistaking the thief for their own child. \"The zither’s heart in triple measure dances with the embryonic immortal\"—this \"triple measure\" is the \"three returns\" of the *Yinfu Jing*, namely the three barriers: refining essence into qi, refining qi into spirit, and refining spirit to return to the void.\n\nOrdinary people, from dawn to dusk, ceaselessly and recklessly engage in actions that harm life. By day, they exhaust their spirit; by night, they indulge in desire to deplete their essence. When essence, spirit, and qi are nearly spent, illness follows. The *Baopuzi* states: \"A finite thing cannot supply an endless drain; the flow of rivers cannot fill a bottomless vessel.\" If one whose income is meager yet expenses vast cannot make ends meet, how much less can one with no income at all sustain a thousandfold outflow?\n\nThe Master said: I transmit the method of heart and breath interdependence to gather the prenatal, replenishing what has been damaged and depleted—this is the way to \"earn money.\" For every portion of qi earned, one gains a portion of treasure; for five portions of qi earned, five portions of treasure—this is a method of boundless profit, a certainty. One need only be willing to practice, to apply oneself with utter devotion.\n\nZhuangzi said: \"Heaven and Earth possess great beauty yet do not speak\"—this great beauty is the singular qi. The *Xinyin Jing* speaks of \"revolving wind merging in harmony, a hundred days’ work manifesting efficacy,\" or of \"reverting the light to illumine within.\" Though the words differ, those with the Dao know the practice is the same. \"Revolving wind merging\" is \"reverting the light\"; \"reverting the light\" is \"revolving wind merging\"—one in two, two in one.\n\nI asked how one knows they are the same. The Master said: Wind is breath. \"Revolving wind merging\" means uniting spirit with breath, breath with spirit. In essence, it is the interdependence of heart and breath, merging spirit and qi as one. \"Reverting the light\" means the fire of the heart, which naturally flames upward, is now made to turn its light downward. To \"illumine\" is to shine upon the water of the kidneys. When the heart’s light descends, the kidney’s water naturally ascends—extracting from Kan to fill Li, the task is complete. This is the natural effect within the physical body. If discussed externally, \"reverting the light\" is simply the interdependence of heart and breath.\n\nTen thousand volumes of alchemical texts, expounded again and again, ultimately describe nothing but the four characters: \"heart and breath interdependent.\" Though the discourse may seem engaging, shifting from this to that with great delight, it all comes down to three words one cannot master, cannot achieve. They speak of the external mysterious pass.\n\nThe Master said: When heart and breath interdepend outside, this is the external mysterious pass. The mysterious pass is the most wondrous mechanism. Ke Huaijing said: \"The mysterious pass arises only after spirit and qi unite\"—this is well put. For when spirit and qi merge, the mysterious pass forms. If heart and breath do not interdepend in ordinary times, spirit and qi do not unite, and there is no mysterious pass.\n\nIn learning the Dao, the most precious thing is to receive the complete fire-phase. Yet teachers are reluctant to transmit it lightly, for it involves the transformations of each stage of the fire-phase. The value of the Dao lies precisely here. If you cannot realize it yourself, you will only attain what is transmitted to you, stopping there. Without further guidance from the teacher, you will not know what follows. Thus, the ancients practiced under their masters.\n\nThe subtleties of the fire-phase are many. Once transmitted, you have a foundation. With its minute transformations, you will naturally discern and comprehend everything when the time comes. Among my disciples, only one, surnamed Wang—a relative of mine—has received the complete fire-phase. A few others have received half, but I do not transmit it lightly. Some claim to possess it, yet when it comes to practice, they have nothing.\n\nThus, the living zi and living wu, the furnace and cauldron, the celestial orbit, the gathering, refining, and forging—all are but ink on paper. The *Cantong Qi* says: \"Use the non-existent to control the existent; the vessel’s use lies in its emptiness.\" How profound! This refers to the oral instructions of the great Dao, the most difficult to obtain being the complete fire-phase. This \"complete\" is no easy matter. My twenty-odd years of seeking were for the sake of obtaining the complete oral instructions of the fire-phase. Thus, the complete fire-phase is the true treasure.\n\nQianxuzi said: \"A once-in-a-millennium encounter\"—this is no empty words. While other aspects may be realized through personal insight, the fire-phase cannot be self-realized. Hence, Xue Zixian said: \"The sages transmit the medicine but not the fire; the fire-phase has always been known by few.\"",

      "translated_text": "\"Do not treat the great Dao as child’s play; you must deliberate it alongside immortals. *‘Push aside the iron face my mother bore—make you and I as steady as can be, make yin and yang topple and invert.’* These three lines, each one a transformation of the fire-phase—grasp this, and it is enough.\n\nThe essence of refining the self lies in the seven characters the ancients spoke: *‘Seal the senses, lower the lids, and silently observe.’* *‘Empty the heart, fill the belly’*—this is the true meaning of the Dao. Yet to fill the belly, one must first empty the heart. When the heart is empty, the primordial yang of heaven and earth naturally arrives, and the belly fills of itself. All ordinary people, their deluded thoughts surging, their essence leaking—how empty or full they are may be known. Thus, the two words *‘empty the heart’* are the bridge to entering the Dao.\n\nOnce you obtain the oral instructions and begin cultivation, from this day forth, you may ensure essence does not leak. Though the fire-phase is said to be difficult to know and difficult to practice, if I explain it to you plainly, it is in fact most simple and most easy. Dan Yang said: *‘The entire method of the elixir, from beginning to end, lies in nothing more than the four words *heart and breath interdependent.* Where there is a fire-phase for each stage, it is but the transformations within the interdependence of heart and breath at each stage. In sum: it is natural.’*\n\nAmong all elixir texts, whether poems, lyrics, songs, rhapsodies, discourses, or commentaries, those that contain the fire-phase are true scriptures; those without are false. No matter how grandly they speak, it is of no use. Thus, I need only read two or three pages to judge their authenticity. If it is poetry, three to five verses suffice to discern the truth.\n\nMaster Sanfeng’s lines—*‘Displaying divine powers, planting lotuses in raging fire; wielding the craftsman’s hand, poling a boat in weak waters’*—are all secret teachings of the fire-phase. Liu Huayang said: *‘When the root of lust and the mechanism of desire stir, refine them with wind and fire, and the external yang will naturally recede.’* This, too, speaks of the fire-phase.\n\nAmong the elixir texts of various schools, all mention the fire-phase, but none so well as the *Wuzhen Pian*—every verse speaks of it. Previously, due to illness, I had just emerged from the gate of death, my spirit utterly depleted, and thus truly could not attend to you. Today, your arrival is timely; I will speak with you in detail about where to begin.\n\nGenerally, in learning the Dao, one must first understand the two eight trigrams of Fuxi and King Wen—prior-heaven and posterior-heaven. The *Book of Changes* is a work jointly authored by the Four Sages; those two eight trigrams are the origin of both Confucianism and Daoism. Even the *Yinfu Jing*, *Daode Jing*, *Great Learning*, and *Doctrine of the Mean* do not lie beyond their scope. Therefore, those who study the Dao yet do not comprehend these two eight trigrams will fail to understand elixir texts, grasping only branches and leaves while neglecting the root.\n\nNow, I shall reveal their secrets to you. Fuxi’s prior-heaven eight trigrams—with *Qian* in the south and *Kun* in the north—are the trigrams of the unbroken, youthful body. Within and without the body, all is prior-heaven. Cultivating this, through clarity and non-action, one may complete the Dao without need for return—this is what is meant by *‘the highest virtue acts not.’*\n\nKing Wen’s posterior-heaven eight trigrams, however, relegate *Qian* and *Kun* to useless positions, replacing them with *Li* and *Kan*—the trigrams of our already-broken bodies. Once the body is broken, the prior-heaven pure yang is lost. If at this point one relies solely on King Wen’s posterior-heaven eight trigrams to seek life, one can never return to the root and restore the origin. As Lu Qianxu said: *‘Once the wine and sweet liquor have been uncovered, no matter how tightly you seal the vessel, you cannot prevent spoilage.’* Thus, to return to the root and restore the origin, one must seek it in Fuxi’s prior-heaven eight trigrams—this is the *‘external move’* of the body, what is called prior-heaven.\n\nIn the prior-heaven eight trigrams, *Qian* and *Kun* serve as the gate and door—these are the two words *heart* and *breath*. Below *Qian* and above *Kun* lies the circle, the void—this is called the Yellow Way. *Qian* is the crucible, *Kun* the furnace. When heart and breath interdepend, the furnace and crucible are formed. The furnace must be empty, the crucible must be empty—thus, heart and breath must rely within the void. As Zi Yang said: *‘Having driven the two things into the Yellow Way’*—once the two things enter the Yellow Way, naturally *‘you will effortlessly obtain the golden elixir.’*\n\nThis is the harmony of yin and yang giving rise to transformation—the work of life outside the body, the natural action of prior-heaven. When *Qian* and *Kun* return to the Yellow Way, that is, when heart and breath interdepend externally, the posterior-heaven *Li* and *Kan* naturally unite. *Li* is the heart, *Kan* the belly. When heart and breath interdepend externally, within the colored body, the heart-fire naturally descends—this is the heart-light shining downward. As the heart-light shines downward, the kidney-water naturally ascends. The union of *Kan* and *Li* is the inner nature and principle of this body—the natural non-action of posterior-heaven.\n\nZi Yang said: *‘Within, there is a natural true fire; in the furnace, a radiant, enduring glow.’* This is the effect that arises of itself—no need to manage it. All fires in the world blaze upward, yet only the sun shines downward. All waters in the world flow downward, yet only the tide surges upward. Thus it is said: *‘Heaven responds to the stars, earth responds to the tide.’* Clearly, the reversal of prior-heaven transformation and the forward movement of posterior-heaven transformation are vastly different.\n\nThose who study the Dao practice reversing posterior-heaven to become prior-heaven. Thus, when heart and breath unite as one, the heart becomes empty. When the heart is empty, the false yang on either side of the *Li* trigram (that is, the heart-fire) naturally ceases to blaze upward and instead shines downward. The liquid of wood (the true yin within *Li*) thereby does not wither—elixir texts call this *‘calming the fire to nourish wood.’*\"",
      "overlap_context": "se. This \"complete\" is no easy matter. My twenty-odd years of seeking were for the sake of obtaining the complete oral instructions of the fire-phase. Thus, the complete fire-phase is the true treasure.\n\nQianxuzi said: \"A once-in-a-millennium encounter\"—this is no empty words. While other aspects may be realized through personal insight, the fire-phase cannot be self-realized. Hence, Xue Zixian said: \"The sages transmit the medicine but not the fire; the fire-phase has always been known by few.\"",

      "translated_text": "The illumination shines upon the two false yin of the *Kan* trigram (that is, the kidney-water). Once kidney-water is illuminated by heart-fire, it naturally ceases to flow downward and instead transforms into qi, ascending upward. With the water thus ascending, only the single line within *Kan* remains—is this not refining water to become metal? Thus, by calming the fire to nourish wood, one naturally refines water to become metal.\n\nOriginally, the wood-liquid within *Li* is an old substance of the *Kun* earth, being true yin. The true metal within *Kan* is an old substance of the *Qian* heaven, being true yang. As it is said: *“That which originates from heaven inclines upward; that which originates from earth inclines downward,”* each following its kind. Therefore, when the adept reaches the state of utmost emptiness and profound stillness, a yang qi suddenly surges upward—is this not the *Qian* metal within *Kan* turning upward? Alchemical texts call this *“the tiger arising from within water.”* As the yang qi surges upward, a true liquid suddenly descends within the heart—is this not the wood-liquid of *Li* descending? Alchemical texts call this *“the dragon emerging from within fire.”* Thus it is said: *“When sweet dew descends, heaven and earth unite; where yellow sprouts arise, Kan and Li intersect.”* It is also called *“taking from Kan to fill Li,”* meaning to fill the emptiness within *Li* with the fullness of *Kan*. Thereby, *Qian* and *Kun* settle into their positions, and the elixir is formed.\n\nYet this speaks only of principle; the method is not quite so. The master further said: The two outer yin of *Kan* are posterior-heaven water, that is, leaking essence. Now, when heart-fire steams it, the water, being steamed by fire, gradually transforms into qi and ascends. Each time the work is done, a portion of the water is refined away. With prolonged effort, the water is entirely transformed, and yin is exhausted while yang is pure—external yang can no longer rise. For when yin essence is fully transformed, the root of lust is eradicated, and there is no principle by which it could rise. If external yang stirs even slightly, a portion of yin essence remains unrefined. Only when external yang ceases all movement is yin essence fully transformed. The above speaks of principle. The progress of the work is but a single matter of steadiness.\n\nKnow that refining essence into qi depends on steadiness. Refining qi into spirit depends on steadiness. Refining spirit to return to emptiness also depends on steadiness. Thus the scripture says: *“Great steadiness perfects the true.”* And again: *“Within steadiness, the elixir is seen to form.”* And: *“In prolonged steadiness, spirit, wisdom, and power manifest.”*\n\nDiscussing the two “return” characters, Lu Qianxu said:\n*“Within Li, cultivate steadiness by observing return;\nWithin the water府, seek the mysterious by observing return.\nObserve return, return to observe, observe return again—\nOnly then will you know the wondrous subtlety of the two mysteries.”*\n\nThe master said: This elucidates Laozi’s chapter on *“attaining utmost emptiness and guarding profound stillness.”* Know that Laozi’s observation of return proceeds from stillness to movement: the prior-heaven one qi moves to its extreme and becomes still, then from stillness returns to movement. *“These two emerge together yet differ in name; together they are called the mysterious,”* which is the purport of observing the wondrous and observing the subtlety.\n\nFrom the interdependence of heart and breath to the state of steadiness, where inhalation and exhalation cease—like the roots of plants and trees in deep winter—this is called the first mystery, the observation of the wondrous. When steadiness reaches its extreme and movement arises, it is the natural cyclic mechanism of heaven and earth. Thus, within steadiness, yang is born, revealing the heart of heaven and earth, and the work of gathering and refinement begins—this is the second mystery, the observation of the subtlety. Together, they are called the two mysteries. Thus it is said: *“Mysterious, and again mysterious—the gateway to all wonders.”* Know that the two mysteries emerge from the gateway of all wonders, and the gateway of all wonders is called emptiness.\n\nThis time, due to my daughter-in-law and granddaughter’s grave illness, my heart grew anxious, and the four evils—wind, cold, water, and dampness—all assailed my body. I hurriedly applied the work, but upon falling asleep, chaotic dreams arose like mountains. I knew this time would not end well. Why?",

      "translated_text": "When a person nears death, the spirit becomes confused and disordered. With the spirit in such turmoil, how can one stabilize and retain the qi? Thus, the practice of heart and breath interdependence becomes ineffective. At this stage, my heart was filled with dread. Yet I persisted with utmost effort, practicing continuously for four days and nights, only then dispelling the chaotic dreams and feeling a slight ease in my heart. Thereafter, I practiced without distinction of day or night for another seven days, gradually expelling the wind and cold. Only then did I realize I might not die after all.\n\nNow, I still practice daily, engaging in nothing else, intending to continue for a hundred days to fully restore my lost vitality. This is within my grasp, and my calculations are sound. Thus, when gravely ill, the true value of the Dao becomes evident.\n\nFrom now on, if you wish to study, read Zhang Sanfeng’s *Essentials of the Mysterious*. Should you comprehend even half of it, when I discuss the firing times with you, you will grasp them with ease.\n\nWang Hunran was a disciple of Qiu Changchun. Upon their meeting, they found such mutual resonance that their bond was profound. They conversed for over ten days. One day, Changchun called him and said: “Do you believe the Dao ends here? That cultivating it leads directly to its realization?”\n\nHunran, startled, remained silent for a long while before replying: “You have already revealed the great essentials of the Dao. How could cultivating it not lead to its realization?”\n\nChangchun said: “All that I have discussed with you thus far is but the dregs of the Dao. Its true secret lies in the firing times. Consider this: do you truly understand the subtleties of each stage of the firing process?”\n\nHunran then bowed and sought further instruction. Changchun proceeded to elucidate its intricacies in detail, exhausting its profound depths.\n\nThe master said: “Since ancient times, when a true teacher encounters a worthy disciple, this is how it has always been. In refining the self, one must attain a body like the great void, a heart transcending all things, unstained by even a speck of dust, and the six senses in perfect stillness—only then can one proceed to higher matters. As Zhang Sanfeng said:\n\n*‘I am a sea of purity, unstained by even a speck of dust.\nI am a luminous pearl, suspended in the emptiness.\nI am an iron steamed bun, too hard to bite.\nI am a touchstone, revealing all grades of gold.’*\n\nIf one can embody these four lines, no barrier will remain unbroken, and the attainment of the Dao is certain.”\n\nHe further stated: “In refining the self, one must take these four lines of Zhang Sanfeng as the standard. Otherwise, the work remains incomplete.”\n\nZhen Qing said: “When a practitioner senses the primordial qi, it must be preserved with utmost care. Never, upon feeling an improvement in vitality, engage in frivolous activities that waste spirit. If today you gain a measure of primordial qi, guard that measure and allow no further dissipation. Should you indulge in grand discourse, the qi you have gathered will be expended. To gain and then lose it—is this not a pity?\n\nI have observed opium smokers: when the craving arises, their sole thought is of smoking, nothing else. After a few pipes, their vitality improves, their spirits lift, and they seek company to converse with, laughing loudly and jesting endlessly. Practitioners of the Dao are no different. When the work reaches the state of utter emptiness and profound stillness, one can attract the true yang from without, and vitality naturally improves. Yet if one gathers it day after day, vitality grows daily, and feeling no outlet for it, one may devise all manner of unnecessary tasks—engaging in grand discourse, seeking labor, refusing rest—thereby covertly transforming the gathered primordial qi into mundane vitality and squandering it. This point is of utmost importance and must be guarded against.”\n\nHe also said: “If, at the outset, the work of refining the self is deep, the heart free of stray thoughts, and the body like the great void, then such issues will not arise in later practice. Their occurrence is always due to the impurity of self-refinement.”\n\nThe necessity of a companion in Daoist practice arises precisely for this reason. In the *Collected Works of Bai Ziqing*, there is a piece titled *The Hook-and-Lock Linked Cycle*, beginning with “The golden elixir is none other than mercury” and continuing until it reaches the utmost heights. By reading this, you will understand that the great Dao of the primordial is truly the simplest and easiest. Yet people seek only its branches and leaves, failing to recognize that *“the primordial chaos of emptiness and nothingness is the ancestral origin.”*\n\nThe *Great Cavern Scripture* states: *“Abide in the great nothingness beyond,”* teaching one to remain in the emptiness outside, nurturing the dharmakāya with the true yang of the void. Lü Zu’s *Hundred-Character Tablet* says: *“In movement and stillness, know the ancestral origin,”* referring to the emptiness beyond, from which one must not depart even for a moment. *“Comprehending the foundation of kan and li”* also pertains to this external dimension. Each day, if you rest your heart and breath in the external, the true bellows and crucible will form instantly. This is an exceedingly simple matter.\n\nThe *Guidelines* states: *“When a single thought stirs, it is all fire; when the myriad conditions are still, spring arises.”* A single thought stirring generates deviant fire; when thoughts follow one after another, the deviant fire burns ever more fiercely. When the myriad conditions are stilled, body and mind are at leisure and peace, and thus spirit and qi harmonize, as if in the midst of spring.\n\nThe Dao gathers in emptiness, so one must turn outward from within, merging spirit and qi in the void. Zhuangzi said: *“Only the Dao gathers in emptiness,”* and again: *“Refine it further and further, until it ascends to heaven.”* Here, “heaven” also refers to the void. He further said: *“When arranged and departed, transformation enters the vast and solitary heaven.”* The “vast and solitary heaven” likewise refers to the void.",

The Master said: *“I transmit to you two essential verses—commit them firmly to memory: ‘Spirit and qi enter the void; return to the void and merge into the primordial.’ As long as the primordial chaos remains undying, you too shall not perish.”* The *Classic of Purity* states: *“If one can abide in constant clarity and stillness, heaven and earth will all return.”* Here, “heaven and earth” denote the microcosm of the human body, not the macrocosm beyond the body. The *Four-Hundred-Character Inscription* says: *“Chaos enfolds the void; the void enfolds the Three Realms. Yet when one traces their root-source, it is but a grain of millet.”* The Master said: *“If you attain chaos, it encompasses all—truly, this is ‘one resolves a hundred matters.’”* Thus Lü Dongbin spoke of *“the true secret lies hidden in chaos.”* When spirit and qi return to their root, this means they return to the void, merging with the vast darkness into oneness. External paths, unaware, claim that “returning to the root” means the breath settling below the navel—thus they remain fixated on the foul skin-bag.\n\nZhang Sanfeng’s *Twenty-Four Songs of the Rootless Tree* are fine, yet they do not match the *Twelve Daoist Ballads of Sweeping Light* in directness and forthrightness, which lay bare the liver and gall to reveal the truth. Observe its words: *“Sweep with light, and the true is revealed.”* And again: *“Sweep with light, and the One is revealed.”* Its closing lines say: *“Nature returns to life, life returns to heaven, and returning life merges into chaos before time.”* How excellent these three phrases are—better than reading ten thousand volumes of alchemical texts. The *Daoist Ballads of Sweeping Light* state: *“To brighten the eyes, one must read the wordless sutra.”* And further: *“The body is not the Dao; the Dao is not the mind. Do not mistake body and mind for the true person.”* Thus one must not cling to the colored form in seeking clarity.\n\nLü Dongbin’s *Song of Knocking on Hexagrams*, though spanning thousands of words, contains much figurative language that leads one astray. You must focus on its pivotal line. Where is this pivot? It says: *“Above the Great Void, the true cultivator—luminous and perfect, nothing remains. Nothing remains, only the Dao is manifest; from the five directions emerges the true person’s visage.”* These seven words—*“luminous and perfect, nothing remains”*—reveal the meaning of attaining true emptiness, surpassing even the earlier lines: *“Dim and obscure, born of vagueness; vague and indistinct, coalescing into form.”* This is the authentic transmission of the pillar’s profound teaching, the supreme and most true wondrous Dao. If one follows Liao Chanhui’s words—*“Facing the navel wheel behind, the kidneys; between them lies the true golden crucible”*—one has entered the demonic path.\n\nThe closing passage of the *Song of Knocking on Hexagrams* says: *“Day and night, they toil and call in vain; seizing profit and contending for fame like a boiling cauldron.”* Each time I read this, I sigh deeply.\n\nOn the firing process:\nThe Master said: *“Fu Xi’s diagram is the firing process—from Qian it gradually moves to Kun, and from Kun it gradually returns to Qian. This is gradual, not achieved in a single leap.”* Thus the *Scripture of Yin Convergence* states: *“The Dao of heaven and earth is gradual.”* After the Great Heat comes the Beginning of Autumn, cooling bit by bit; from the Winter Solstice to the depths of winter, all grows and diminishes imperceptibly, in accord with nature’s subtlety. If one were to force a sudden change after the Great Heat, it would violate the natural order. Hence the *Triple Unification* compares it to *“the depths of winter’s great dryness, the height of summer’s frost and snow”*—within this lies a wondrous principle.\n\nIn our practice, to lose the subtlety of “gradual” is to depart from the natural. What is unnatural is not the Dao. Charcoal burns hotter than firewood—this is common knowledge. Consider cooking meat: first, use charcoal to boil it vigorously; once done, switch to firewood to simmer it slowly, allowing the broth to reduce—then the meat is truly flavorful. There is no other reason: the firing process has reached perfection. The same applies to elixir refinement. Charcoal is the martial fire; firewood is the civil fire. Water and fire are the heart and breath. Use martial fire for wild combat, civil fire for guarding the city and nurturing—then the primordial great medicine will naturally be forged according to the method, like meat cooked to tenderness and pure flavor.\n\nBreath interdependent is martial fire; breathless absorption is civil fire. Absorption reaches the point of forgetting both inner and outer—this is the cessation of fire. Li Daochun’s commentary on the *Dao De Jing* surpasses those of Lu and Li. His skill in practice is excellent, and his writing is superb, hence he rises above all other schools. I once thought Feng Zunshi’s works were commendable in their external approach, but upon reading them, I found no firing process—now I have removed them (though they were previously included in the *Eastern Pavilion Essentials*). What use is a teaching without the firing process?\n\nLu Qianxu’s *Dao De Jing* contains five parts firing process and five parts imagery. Zhang Sanfeng’s *Essentials of the Mysterious* has six or seven parts firing process and three parts imagery. My *Essentials of the Mysterious* is purely the firing process, without a single image. I take others’ imagery and, through step-by-step explanation, transform it entirely into the firing process. Moreover, having read extensively in alchemical texts, I have compiled all the wondrous insights on the firing process from various schools into the *Essentials of the Mysterious*. Thus, this book truly surpasses all others—yet alas, people fail to recognize its worth, mistaking gold for copper. Only one person, surnamed Wang, has understood my work; I have no other true connoisseurs.\n\nFor over thirty years, I have delved into the root-source, fathoming the subtle workings of the void. I wish to speak plainly to those who understand, without concealment—hence these earnest words.",

      "translated_text": "Such phrases as \"even a thread of attachment to the corporeal form\" being \"a hair’s breadth off, and the elixir fails\" are truths no predecessor has ever spoken. To those of discernment, these words are a delight to read; but to those clinging to forms, or those who fix their practice upon the physical body, they pass through the eyes and are dismissed as nothing. At this, the Master heaved a deep sigh.\n\nThe firing process arises from the interdependence of mind and breath. Were I to transmit to you the entire oral formula now, you would not comprehend it. Thus the ancients waited until a disciple had reached a certain stage before offering a single word of enlightenment—only then would the teaching take root, and both parties benefit. When the firing process is explained, it seems bland and insipid. The various elucidations of outsiders belong to the realm of post-celestial *gewu* (investigation of things), which is already formidable; our practice, however, belongs to the realm of pre-celestial *gewu*, which is even more so. The *Book of Changes* is the ancestral text of the Three Teachings; after receiving the formula, one must study it hundreds of times before the entire firing process can be fully grasped.\n\nWithout reading alchemical texts, the body can revert to youth in ten months—this is the Way of utmost simplicity and ease. Those who do not read find the practice easier, for they follow instructions without question. The interdependence of mind and breath is also spoken of in terms of imagery. As *Awakening to Reality* says: *\"Though one speaks of cinnabar and mercury, without knowing the firing process, it is all in vain.\"* Cinnabar and mercury are none other than mind and breath. You must first empty the mind; once the practice is mature, then interdependence follows. Simply by emptying the mind, one can prevent the leakage of essence. When the practice of emptying the mind is perfected, and one then turns to external interdependence, even if a single insight arises, it will follow the ebb and flow of breath—how then could stray thoughts arise?\n\nWu Chongxu said: *\"Before beginning practice, one must first cultivate stillness for a month.\"* Such crucial phrases must not be overlooked when reading. The ancients said: *\"Since ancient times, there have been six hundred firing records, each resembling the next in gathering true lead.\"* It is always the interdependence of mind and breath, though with variations—how could it be otherwise? Hence, *\"each resembling the next.\"*\n\nWhen first encountering a disciple, one must discuss alchemical texts to subdue their mind. If one were to immediately speak of wordlessness, the absence of the celestial cycle, or the irrelevance of the midnight-noon axis, how could they believe you? Zhang Sanfeng said: *\"Make self and other as stable as can be; make yin and yang as topsy-turvy as they may be—repelling demons depends entirely on the sword of wisdom.\"* These three lines are the first stage of practice, striking the very essence. The last line is especially crucial: if any vision arises, swiftly return to the interdependence of mind and breath. The next line—*\"Dare to pluck the blossoms blooming beyond the wall\"*—is the second stage of practice. When the practice is well-executed, nothing is subject to your control.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* says: *\"Stopping at the back, one does not perceive the body\"*—this is forgetting form. *\"Walking in the courtyard, one does not see the person\"*—this is forgetting others. When both self and other are forgotten, one enters the state of stillness in *Gen*. The reason we write books is that Master Wu once remarked: if one could compose a work that establishes a school of thought and transmits it to later generations for the benefit of all beings, it would be the greatest merit. Thus, I have labored tirelessly for thirty years to complete *The Mysterious Essentials of the Golden Elixir*. Alas, how much hardship it has cost me!\n\nIf Master Meng comes this summer, you must take a week’s leave and come to me. First, because I do not understand his language, and second, because Master Meng saved me in my time of need—all thanks to your letter. I am deeply grateful to you and wish to let you hear these secret essentials. In the future, if you meet Master Tang, you may tell him as well, so that I may transmit to three people. If I were to teach only one, it would exhaust my energy, and later there would be no one to verify or discuss with, which would also be inconvenient for you.\n\nLi Daochun’s practice was profound, which is why the final chapter of *The Pointers to the Nature and Life* still praises him. I was once instructed to read the poems of Ancestor Li. If you read *The Mysterious Essentials of the Golden Elixir* dozens or even a hundred times, enlightenment will surely dawn. But if you abandon it before ten readings, how can you penetrate its depths? The proverb says: *\"At the end of the mountain path and the river’s flow, one despairs of the way—then willows darken and flowers brighten to reveal another village.\"* This holds a profound mystery. In our practice, when we reach the state of primordial chaos and emptiness, the breath ceases as if in a small death—such is the experience.\n\nThe Master spoke of my sincerity and thus transmitted a starting point. When Master Meng came to Shanghai, we spoke only twice, and I did not even teach him the complete starting method.",

      "translated_text": "If Meng Junruo could meet with me now and practice for several more months, he would be able to completely eliminate the medicinal water. The verse in *Awakening to Reality*—*\"Common sayings often align with the sagely Dao\"*—is truly excellent. It refers precisely to the firing times. For instance, the common phrase *\"heart and qi in harmony\"*—this is all that cultivation of the Dao requires. Thus, if one can turn inward to seek it, *\"the mountains and rivers of the great earth all become treasure.\"* Life and death are separated by but a single thread: following the current leads to death, reversing it leads to immortality. The principle is subtle and profound, unknown to the world. Hence, Shi Xinglin said: *\"The Great Dao lies right before your eyes.\"*\n\nThe *Baopuzi* contains countless discussions on the firing times, all of them astonishingly profound—what a pity you do not read it. \"Leaving the household\" is but a symbol. The body is the abode of spirit, and to grope about in the postnatal physical form is never the Great Dao. One must depart from this body and nurture it in the emptiness of space. When spirit leaves the physical form and stabilizes externally, this is true \"leaving the household.\" \"Entering the mountains\" is also a symbol. The mountain is the image of the *Gen* hexagram—*Gen* means cessation. When spirit stabilizes externally and body and mind are still and unmoving, this is \"entering the mountains.\" It is like the Yellow Emperor entering Kongtong and attaining the Dao. The ancients practiced the Dao as great recluses in the marketplace, and only after completing their great work and advancing to the highest spiritual cultivation would they enter the deep mountains. Never did they enter the mountains while worldly affairs remained unresolved or their practice was not yet two-thirds complete.\n\nThe Master further said: When practice reaches the great stabilization of the six senses, where one remains unmoved by external phenomena, utterly still and perpetually serene, this is true \"entering the mountains.\" Once the heart has entered the mountains, one may dwell in the marketplace. In the state of indistinct obscurity, emptiness, and primordial chaos—where form and things are forgotten, and stabilization occurs externally—the longer it endures, the more wondrous it becomes, the more spiritually potent. This is the gathering of primordial qi. As practice deepens and advances, one may eventually attain the Dao. The ancient immortals said: *\"A year or two of diligence brings a thousand aeons of bliss\"*—this is no exaggeration. The *Cantong Qi* compares it to *\"erecting a pole to see its shadow, calling into a valley to hear its echo.\"* This Dao is truly swift beyond all conception.\n\nThe Mysterious Female aperture is the most profound and wondrous—all methods of elixir refinement, even to the point of spiritual transformation and shedding the mortal coil, depend entirely on this aperture. As the saying goes: *\"Attain this one thing, and all matters are complete.\"* That I have grasped this technique is truly due to the accumulated virtue of my ancestors—how could it be easy?\n\nFrom *Wang Zu’s Record of True Teachings: Notes on the Essentials*—\n\nIn beginning one’s practice, one must first attain clarity and stillness. Clarity means purifying the heart; purifying the heart means emptying it. Stillness means calming the qi; calming the qi means harmonizing and balancing the breath. When stillness is achieved, the qi becomes harmonious. Then, just beyond the nostrils, apply a trace of awareness to perceive the movement of the breath. Place the heart externally, allowing no thoughts to arise, and all conditions will cease. In an instant, the qi will naturally become still.\n\nOnce the qi is tranquil, the natural in-and-out of the breath will become perceptible externally. This is using qi to seek spirit, not using spirit to seek qi. Using qi to seek spirit is most natural. The qi will naturally seek spirit without any need for your awareness. If you use spirit to seek qi, the qi will not desire the spirit, and the spirit will merely be the spirit of consciousness, not the original spirit. This is not the true union of husband and wife, not the true bellows, not the true crucible and furnace—it falls into the realm of postnatal intention.\n\nThus, counting the breaths is not the same as violently forcing the breath. If the spirit is not at ease, the body will not feel comfortable. This is a grave error. Once you perceive the faint in-and-out of the breath externally, simply follow its natural course and forget it. The act of preserving is not deliberate, nor is the act of forgetting. Both preservation and forgetting arise naturally, without the slightest exertion of force. Whether you sleep or remain awake, leave it to itself—I merely remain unattached, utterly muddled.\n\nIf there is the slightest sensation of softness, once perceived, immediately return to the external reliance. If there is the slightest movement, once perceived, likewise return to the external reliance. As stillness deepens, the breath gradually becomes finer, and the physical body gradually softens. In the midst of stillness, if you sense movement anywhere in the physical body, continue to rely externally. This must become a natural habit. Whenever there is any movement or stillness, large or small, within or without the physical body, as soon as you become aware of it, without any deliberate intention, naturally turn your entire heart to rely externally on the breath—this is excellent.\n\nThe softer the areas of the physical body become, the softer they grow. The finer the breath becomes, the finer it grows, until it ceases entirely, with no in-and-out. This is when spirit stabilizes in the external emptiness—this is the Celestial Heart. At this time, if the external yang stirs even the slightest bit, immediately return to the external union of heart and breath. For when spirit and qi have merged as one, stillness is one, and movement is one. When still, they are still together; when moving, they move together. Thus, when the external yang stirs, the spirit also knows. When the yang moves, the spirit also moves, and the qi shifts from stillness to movement. The mouth and nose immediately resume breathing, and I swiftly return externally to reunite spirit and qi.\n\nWhen the spirit perceives, the heart and qi separate and manifest through the mouth and nose. This is the unity of spirit and qi—when the spirit moves, the qi moves; when the spirit is still, the qi is still. Thus, the external yang naturally recedes without any need to manage it. Gradually, you return to softness and indistinctness, relying until stabilization is achieved. In stabilization, the external yang stirs again, and you once more rely externally.",

      "translated_text": "Relying thus, you gradually settle into stillness again. Practicing this day after day, you reach the point where, when the external yang arises, your intent does not stir, and the heart naturally turns outward to rely on the breath—this is mastery. For by this time, the spirit has grown perceptive; it naturally goes to rely without needing instruction. You need only embrace the word \"stability\" as your sovereign. Whether the Great Circulation or the Small Circulation, the moment the bodily form stirs the slightest awareness, you return externally to rely. The deeper the practice, the longer the stability. You must cultivate until, when yang stirs in stillness, it is as if you remain unaware—it arises on its own, while you abide in your stability, serene and unmoved as before. Then the Gate of Yang gradually closes. When, in stillness, the external yang no longer stirs in the slightest, the yin essence is fully transformed—this is called \"returning to youth.\"\n\nThe Ancestor said: The Great Dao is nothing more than the word \"stability.\" Yet \"stability\" is but a figurative term; it is truly the word \"forgetting.\" And \"forgetting\" is also figurative; it is truly the word \"sincerity.\" Thus *The Mirror of Entering the Elixir* states: \"Simply be utterly sincere, and the method arises naturally.\" This utter sincerity and naturalness—discussing its utmost subtlety—cannot be conveyed by speech or captured in writing. Therefore, I say: whatever can be set down in brush and ink is but the fish-trap and rabbit-snare, never the Dao itself. How could the world believe this?\n\nThe Ancestor said: Stability before yang arises, and stability again after yang arises—this stability is indispensable. The crux of the elixir method lies precisely in the work of true emptiness, which is nothing other than the word \"stability.\" With three hours of stability, once true emptiness is attained, you may advance further, extending the duration of true emptiness from short to long. Then the return to youth is no longer in question, and all effects manifest with the effortless ease of water flowing into a channel—the elixir method is already eighty or ninety percent complete.\n\nThe elixir method proceeds step by step by aligning with the Heavenly Heart, not the human heart. When the human heart acts, it differs from the Heavenly Heart. You must understand: the heart is one. If thoughts arise and vanish within the bodily form, alert and wandering, that is the human heart. Detached from the bodily form, abiding externally, silent yet ever-illuminating, thoughtless yet knowing—that is the Heavenly Heart. In sum, to be intentional and attached to form is the human heart in control; to be unintentional, detached from the bodily form, stabilized externally, forgetting yet empty and luminous, with qi flowing harmoniously—like moonlight penetrating water, visible yet insubstantial, reflecting without clinging, illuminating yet ever-empty—is the Heavenly Heart in control. This work must be cultivated.\n\nWhen refining essence, forget the form, and essence will not leak. When refining qi, forget qi, and qi will not leak. The firing process is most crucial. In the initial stage of refining essence, know that martial fire is used for decoction. When yang arises, apply one measure of martial fire—this is relying on the heart and breath externally. Then gradually shift from martial fire to civil fire—this is entering stability without breath. Civil fire is for gentle nurturing. From stability, shift into the realm of forgetting. Profound forgetting of inner and outer—this is ceasing the fire. Ceasing the fire means withdrawing and resting—this is the secret of sealing and securing.\n\nThe Master said: Relying on the breath is martial fire; breathless stability is civil fire; prolonged stability merging into forgetting is ceasing the fire. These three phrases suffice.\n\n**Postscript:** This discourse is the method of the Qing dynasty Ancestor Li Hanxu, transmitted to Wu Tianzhi, who then transmitted it to Wang Dongting. This is Wang Dongting’s record of questions and answers from the fifth to sixth years of the Republic, when he taught Xu Haiyin and other disciples, later compiled by Xu Haiyin.

Gradually, you return to softness and indistinctness, relying until stabilization is achieved. In stabilization, the external yang stirs again, and you once more rely externally.",

      "translated_text": "**The Body-Realized Mountain Man Wang Dongting’s Oral Instructions on Female Alchemy, Volume One**\n\nThe study of nature and life is the same for men and women, without distinction. In sum, it hinges on the four characters: \"utmost sincerity, single-minded devotion.\" As the *Book of Documents* states: \"Only the utmost sincerity under heaven can effect transformation.\" The *Classic* says: \"Utter concentration in listening to the mandate.\" For beginners, the first and most crucial step is nothing other than refining the self. To refine the self is to make the heart and breath interdependent. Interdependence means the heart depends on the breath, and the breath likewise depends on the heart. Yet the most essential element is harmony. The *Canticle* says: \"In harmony, they follow one another,\" and again: \"Each attains its harmony.\" Harmony does not depart from the center, nor does the center depart from harmony. Are center and harmony one or two? When center and harmony unite, this is called the Yellow Dame. When the Yellow Dame harmonizes, naturally there arises mutual love, mutual longing, mutual swallowing, mutual exhaling—continuous and unbroken, neither forgetting nor forcing. Laozi said: \"Concentrate qi to attain suppleness—can you be like an infant?\" This is the perfection of true harmony. Yuchan said: \"When the old husband and wife meet again, affection lingers of itself.\" The *Classic* states: \"Knit into one mass, blended into one place, forged into one sheet, tempered in one furnace.\" And again: \"The Cowherd and Weaver Girl meet; yin and yang follow; crow and hare share a den; sun and moon share a palace; hun and po unite; metal and fire merge.\" In essence, this means spirit does not leave qi, nor qi leave spirit—equivalently, the heart does not leave the breath, nor the breath leave the heart.\n\nNow, spirit is nature, and qi is life. The *Classic* says: \"The root of nature lies in the heart; the stem of life lies in the breath.\" One must know that only when the two unite is creation accomplished. For when the two unite, the Two Modes return to the One Supreme Polarity. This is called the dual cultivation of nature and life. Dual cultivation of nature and life simply teaches one to make the heart and breath interdependent, never parting for even a moment. Thus, Ancestor Bai said: \"Refining the medicine with fire to form the elixir is none other than using spirit to guide qi to attain the Dao.\"\n\nIn daily practice, one must hold the heart to the breath and the breath to the heart. After a short while, when evenness is achieved, natural great stability arises, directly entering the dim and distant, the indistinct and vague—without heaven, without earth, forgetting things, forgetting form. The *Canticle* says: \"The eldest son inherits the father’s body, and by the mother establishes the foundation.\" And again: \"Know the white, guard the black, and spiritual illumination will come of itself.\" This is precisely the moment.",

      "translated_text": "One feels the body and mind soften and revive, extraordinarily refreshed—just as Zhang Sanfeng said: *\"Like a mute tasting honey, it cannot be described.\"* Master Shao put it: *\"In the dim and vague, yin and yang first transform; / In the swirling mist, heaven and earth begin their dance. / Amidst this fleeting wondrous scene, / How could mere words capture the work?\"* The *Canticle* states: *\"Golden sand enters the five viscera, / Dispersing like wind and rain. / Steaming and permeating the four limbs, / The complexion glows with radiant beauty.\"* For at this moment, the primordial qi emerges from the midst of emptiness and nothingness. Master Shao said: *\"At midnight of the winter solstice, / The heart of heaven remains unchanged. / Where the first yang stirs, / All things are yet unborn.\"* This is what the alchemical texts call the *living midnight hour*, what Master Ziyang termed *\"When gui arises, swiftly gather it,\"* and what Master Shangyang described as: *\"What is gathering? It is gathering with the ungathering gather. / What is the ungathering gather? It is rending asunder the primal chaos.\"*\n\nI explain: *\"What is rending asunder the primal chaos? It is the moment of utmost emptiness and profound stillness.\"* For when one attains emptiness to its extreme and guards stillness to its depth, this is returning to Kun. Now Kun is the southwest, the land where the medicine is born, the realm of chaos, the gateway of the Mysterious Female. Master Miao Xi said: *\"To seek the true seed of the primordial, / One must root it in the midst of chaos.\"* Ah! Once the foundation is established and the Valley Spirit never dies, how could a person ever perish?\n\nThe above concerns refining the self and laying the foundation, gathering the great medicine of the primordial—whether for men or women, the practice is no different. Thus it is said: *\"The Great Dao makes no distinction between man and woman; / Yin and yang, the Five Phases are all the same.\"* What follows speaks of the differences in the postcelestial.\n\nMaster Liu Wuyuan’s alchemical instructions state: *\"There is but one true oral formula at the outset— / Yet their methods diverge as heaven from the abyss. / The sun refines qi for men; / The moon refines form for women, like a snare for the hare.\"* For man is yang, and his number is odd. As the Classic says: *\"Heaven One generates water\"*—man embodies this, so he begins at the Kun Palace, one *cun* and three *fen* below the navel. Woman is yin, and her number is even. As the Classic says: *\"Earth Two generates fire\"*—woman embodies this, so she works at the Li position between the two breasts. This is an unchanging principle. What medical texts call the *\"breast stream\"* and alchemical texts call the *\"breast chamber\"* refers to this very aperture.\n\nOf old, Master Lü taught the Immortal Zhang with these words: *\"Kan and Li, Zhen and Dui divide midnight and noon— / You must recognize your own ancestral origin. / Like thunder shaking the mountain, rain falls; / Wait to wash clean the yellow sprout as it emerges from the earth. / Seize the golden essence and firmly seal it; / Refine geng and jia to give birth to dragon and tiger. / When they ask who transmitted this to you, / Simply say the master’s surname is Lü.\"* For one must refine the self to perfection before gaining mastery. And one must daily steal the yang of heaven and earth, constantly steaming and bathing in it, before seeing any effect. Whether one or two months, or three or four, the duration depends on the depth of the practitioner’s effort.\n\nAt times during practice, one may suddenly feel qi surge from the aperture, splitting into two paths that rush straight to the breasts, filling the nipples until they stand firm—this is what the alchemical texts call the *living midnight hour* when the medicine is born. Master Shao said: *\"Suddenly at midnight, a single thunderclap— / A thousand doors and ten thousand gates open in succession. / If you recognize the image hidden within the imageless, / You may meet Fuxi in person.\"* At this stage, the hundred vessels harmonize, all gates and apertures open, and truly *\"one’s whole being brims with spring.\"*\n\nNow the period between midnight and noon is what is meant by *\"Between hai and zi, one obtains the most genuine.\"* *\"Regulating the breath\"* means harmonizing the breath evenly. *\"Sitting\"* refers to the two (yin and yang) dividing left and right, like generals leading their armies. *\"A single earth stands at the center\"*—only because both hold the true earth within. When the true earth returns to the center, qi flows unimpeded, thus directly connecting to the Jiaji Pass. *\"Passing through Kunlun\"* is precisely reversing the flow of the Yellow River. At this time, one feels the strength of qi and thinks of *\"I\"*—*\"I\"* being a metaphor for the pure yang qi. It also means that *\"I\"* have refined the Golden Immortal of the Great One, the Great One containing the true qi.\n\n*\"Kan and Li, Zhen and Dui divide midnight and noon\"*—first establish the four cardinal positions of Kan, Li, Zhen, and Dui, then distinguish the four seasons of zi, wu, mao, and you. *\"Recognize your own ancestral origin\"* means tracing back to the moment of conception, the first reception of qi, and recognizing the primordial ancestral qi. *\"Washing\"* refers to bathing and purifying the heart, refining the self through steaming. *\"Yellow\"* is the color of earth; *\"sprout\"* is the mechanism of life. *\"Emerging from the earth\"* is a metaphor for the renewal of all things in spring, when mountains and rivers are made anew. For this yang qi connects to heaven, blazing like fire, swift as a whirlwind—one must swiftly gather it and send it into the Central Palace, hence: *\"Seize the golden essence and firmly seal it.\"* Zhang Sanfeng said: *\"Seize the golden essence and carefully guide it, / Send it into the Cinnabar Field.\"*\n\n*\"Refine jia and geng to give birth to dragon and tiger\"* means that geng must be born, jia must be born—only then does the path of jia and geng begin to sprout. *\"When they ask who transmitted this to you, / Simply say the master’s surname is Lü.\"* For *\"Lü\"* implies *\"mouth to mouth, aperture to aperture\"*—the heart-to-heart transmission, the oral transmission of the golden elixir’s wondrous formula. In sum, it teaches one to draw fire to press the metal, circulate it through the Microcosmic Orbit, and harmonize the qi of the dragon and tiger, the ascent and descent of yin and yang.\n\nIf one’s effort is diligent, as Ancestor Zhang Sanfeng said: *\"Wait until that single point naturally submits— / Within the body, it transforms into the four seasons of spring. / A wisp of white cloud, a waft of fragrance; / After each rain, everything is renewed.\"*",

Now, among the formulas for the elixir of female adepts, this verse alone is the swiftest path.

      "translated_text": "Wang Dongting’s Discourse on *The Song of the Great Dao of the Numinous Source*\n\nWang Dongting said: *The Song of the Great Dao* is also attributed to Patriarch Liu Haichan, titled *The Song of Utmost Reality*. In my judgment, however, upon examining the elixir texts of past dynasties, all works composed by female adepts speak only of mercury and not of lead, only of water and not of fire. This is because the female adept’s body belongs to the *kun* (earthly) constitution, making it improper to speak of yang fire, and thus only the *yin tally* is discussed.\n\nThis song alone is entirely purged of such references, with not a single word touching upon lead—all it speaks of is true mercury. Moreover, the *Numinous Source* (灵源), as the classics state, is the *spring cavern* (泉窟), which is the root of *spirit-water* (神水). The *Song* says: *“Spirit-water is hard to describe; few recognize it,”* and again: *“Moved by heat, moved by sorrow, moved by thought, moved by wind, / It flows and turns, moistening the whole body, / Yet in the end, it never departs from spirit-water.”* These lines echo *Awakening to Reality*: *“Originally it is but a single taste of mercury, / Circulating through all the celestial bodies; / When yin and yang’s numbers are complete, it naturally becomes spirit— / Entering and exiting without leaving the Mysterious Female.”* For the Mysterious Female is none other than the *Numinous Source*, the spring cavern.\n\nAs for *Utmost Reality* (至真), the classics define it as *utmost yang*. Yet this song speaks solely of true yin—what connection does it have with the term *Utmost Reality*? I assert without doubt that this work was composed by the Immortal Maiden Wen Yixian. Furthermore, Patriarch Liu’s *Returning Gold Treatise* and *The Song of the Returned Elixir* both treat lead and mercury as counterparts—why would this song alone speak of mercury without mentioning lead?\n\nSome may ask: *Is this not solitary yin?* I reply: The Perfected Li’s commentary on the *Scripture of Yin Conformity* states: *“The yin tally refers to yang fire,”* and again: *“To speak of the yin tally is to speak of yang fire within it.”* When one probes the ultimate reality, there is but a single *nothingness* before the union of father and mother—what the sages forcibly depict as the *Wuji* (Ultimate Void), also described as *“invisible, inaudible, untouchable, and beyond inquiry.”*\n\nAlas! The myriad volumes of elixir texts, with their varied and divergent expressions, are but metaphorical speech.",
      "overlap_context": "ign (1899), while residing in Shanghai, I heard of Lady Cao of the Li family from Sanshui County, Guangdong—chaste and pure, learned and knowledgeable, surpassing many men. When we met, we discussed the elixir texts, and she proved no empty reputation. Delighted, I said: *\"Great talents and great scholars in this world all disregard their lives—why should Lady Li alone be so sincere?\"* Thus I compose this piece to present to her. *(Excerpted from The Great Compendium of the Daoist Transmission)*",
