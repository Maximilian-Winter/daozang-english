  "full_translation": "**The Primordial Origin’s Exegesis on the Precelestial *Dao and Virtue Classic***\n\n**Title:** *The Primordial Origin’s Exegesis on the Precelestial Dao and Virtue Classic*. Annotated by Li Jiamou of the Song Dynasty. Five fascicles.\n\n*The Primordial Origin’s Precelestial Dao and Virtue Classic* is distinct from Laozi’s *Dao and Virtue Classic*. Modeled after Laozi’s work, it is divided into five sections: *Mystery* (妙), *Origin* (元), *Spirit* (神), *Authenticity* (真), and *Dao* (道). Li’s annotations proceed chapter by chapter, elucidating the text in sequence.\n\n**Source of the Base Text:** *Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Unity* (《正統道藏》), *Dongzhen* Division, *Benwen* Category.\n\n---\n\n### **Preface to *The Primordial Origin’s Exegesis on the Precelestial Dao and Virtue Classic***\n\nThis classic was annotated chapter by chapter by Master Xizhai, Li Jun Jiamou of the former Song, and its woodblock edition circulated in Western Shu for many years. By the Baoyou era, Xian Tianzi Xie Gong Tunan wrote a preface to transmit it, though the Shu edition had already been lost.\n\nInitially, when Xie served as an official in Lingbiao, he sought this classic and eventually obtained it from the hands of a reclusive scholar from Shu—treasuring it as a rare gem. Later, upon arriving in Western Zhe, he presented it to Li Zengbo, Grand Academician of the Hall of Literary Inspection and Master Kezhai, who generously sponsored its reproduction. Li Kejiu, a Daoist from Jiaxing, then raised funds to have it carved and disseminated. They also acquired the so-called *Eight Mighty Dragon Script*, transmitted by an extraordinary adept of the Precelestial, and engraved it alongside the text, thus completing the work for posterity.\n\nAt the time, Grand Academician Li, who oversaw the Dongxiao Abbey, also wrote a preface. Both prefaces largely followed Xie’s account, identifying the five sections as the \"scattered fragments\" of the *Dao Classic*, claiming their composition was divinely manifested in the azure heavens—beyond human craft. Yet both scholars, in their reverence, perpetuated errors.\n\nNow, upon examination: The *Five Scattered Fragments* of the Primordial Origin’s *Anchoring Scripture* (安镇敷落), along with their true talismans and texts, resemble those transmitted among our disciples—talismanic writs formed in accordance with *qi*, manifesting as: (1) *Luminous Qi* (明炁), (2) *Great Cinnabar* (太丹), (3) *Yellow Authenticity* (黄真), (4) *Plain Might* (素威), and (5) *Mysterious Essence* (玄精). Such is their nature.\n\nThese five sections—*Mystery, Origin, Spirit, Authenticity,* and *Dao*—each comprising chapters, with each chapter a discourse, together totaling five thousand characters, have circulated alongside our *Laozi’s Dao and Virtue* (五千). Yet they differ entirely from the *Scattered Fragments*, bearing no relation to them.\n\nWhen the Wu Commandery’s Gui Fu Daoist Lei Suo Zhang Shanyuan obtained this text, he diligently raised funds to have it carved and transmitted. I append these words to the title’s end merely to clarify what may remain obscure to the reader upon opening the scroll, lest they mistake it for the *Scattered Fragments*.\n\n---\n\n### **The Primordial Origin’s Exegesis on the Precelestial Dao and Virtue Classic, Fascicle One**\n\n#### **Mystery Section: One Thousand Characters, Chapter One (220 Characters)**\n\nTrue Mystery is mystery; true Origin is origin; true Spirit is spirit; true Authenticity is authenticity; true Dao is Dao.\n\nThe Dao and virtue; virtue and the myriad things—thus the myriad things attain [their nature].\n\nThese five names are neither one nor five. The true is the Primordial Origin, unadulterated, unborrowed from external things. Only our singular authenticity: in Mystery, it is true Mystery; in Origin, true Origin; in Spirit, true Spirit; in Authenticity, true Authenticity; in Dao, true Dao.\n\nYet if one seeks to name these five, it cannot be done. It is like the eye’s faculty, which cannot see itself. Thus it is said: True Mystery is mystery; true Origin is origin; true Spirit is spirit; true Authenticity is authenticity; true Dao is Dao.\n\nTherefore, true Mystery does not know its mystery; true Origin does not know its origin; true Spirit does not know its spirit; true Authenticity does not know its authenticity; true Dao does not know its Dao. If they knew themselves, they would not be one.\n\nWhen the Dao is not one, it disperses into virtue. The myriad things each attain one [aspect of virtue], and virtue gives them life. Thus it is said: The myriad things attain [their nature].\n\nThings are born by attaining the Dao and die by losing it. Gain and loss give rise to one another; the Dao is the same in both emergence and withdrawal.\n\nThe myriad things, without exception, are born by receiving the Dao’s oneness. When what they receive departs, they die. Though called \"birth,\" it is merely the arrival of the Dao’s dispersion—what is called the Dao neither lives nor dies.\n\nBecause things cannot attain the Dao in its entirety, they are confined by life and death. Yet as they depend on the Dao, they are indestructible. Thus, life and death, gain and loss arise in succession, emerging and withdrawing in unison with the Dao.\n\nThe Dao cannot be equated with virtue. Virtue cannot be equated; loss cannot be equated.\n\nThus, what is attained is called \"equated.\" There is attainment and loss.\n\nThe Dao is the unadulterated original nature, like empty space, which does not commingle with things. Thus it is said: The Dao cannot be equated with virtue.\n\nThere is softness and hardness, benevolence and righteousness—affairs differ, names vary, like the myriad things, each with its own body. Thus it is said: Virtue cannot be equated.\n\nWhat is received is provisional and false; what is temporarily received is soon lost, like a traveler’s inn, where one rests briefly before departing. Thus it is said: Loss cannot be equated.\n\nWhat is called \"equated\" means: I have attained this, and so has that; each attains what it attains, and only then is it \"equated.\" Though \"equated\" approaches the Dao, seeking the Dao through attainment risks both gain and loss. The more one gains and loses, the farther one strays from the Dao.\n\nLosing virtue returns one to the Dao; the Dao gathers into oneness. Oneness attains authenticity; embodying authenticity responds to change. Authenticity enters the utmost Spirit; Spirit attains Spirit; Spirit enters Origin; Origin attains Origin; Origin enters Mystery.\n\nAbiding in stillness, it seems to exist yet is neither form nor sound. It stands alone in the Primordial Origin—the mystery of the Primordial Origin.\n\nVirtue is the dispersion of nature into affairs, unstable. Thus virtue may be lost, but the Dao is never lost. If virtue is lost, it returns to the Dao—there is no Dao apart from this.\n\nThe Dao resides between life and death, gain and loss, never not one. If one chases the changes of life and death, follows the names of gain and loss, it disperses into virtue. But if one knows it emerges from the Dao and gathers into oneness, then virtue is the Dao, and the Dao and virtue are one.\n\nUnity enters authenticity; embodying authenticity, it responds to change. Though myriad transformations arise, none lose my authenticity—this is called Spirit. The culmination of Spirit is called Origin; the attainment of Origin is called Mystery. Entering Origin, entering Mystery, in truth nothing is gained—only a return to the original state.\n\nNeither form nor sound, abiding in stillness as if existing yet not, standing alone in the Primordial Origin and Primordial Mystery—this is the inherent nature, not obtained from without. The Primordial Origin observes with true Mystery; the Primordial Origin listens with true Mystery. The wondrous gaze sees the formless form; the wondrous hearing perceives the soundless sound. The great image has no shape, yet nothing escapes my wondrous gaze. The supreme tone is soundless, yet nothing escapes my wondrous hearing. I take Mystery as the boundless and supreme.\n\nThe wondrous gaze is without color; the wondrous hearing is without sound. Beyond color and sound, external dust cannot obstruct. The six sense faculties interpenetrate and merge, thus seeing the formless form yet not through the eyes, hearing the soundless sound yet not through the ears. Perception dissolves into perfect clarity. The wondrous gaze transcends heaven and earth; the wondrous hearing surpasses sound and voice. Thus nothing is unseen, nothing unheard—this is called the boundless and supreme. Therefore, I am the boundless and supreme true Mystery.\n\nTrue Mystery, true Origin—true Origin cannot be Origin. True Mystery, true Spirit—true Spirit cannot be Spirit. True Mystery, true Authenticity—true Authenticity cannot be Authenticity. True Mystery, true Dao—true Dao cannot be Dao. True Mystery is ultimate.\n\nThis speaks of embodying Mystery, distinct from those who embody Origin, Authenticity, Spirit, or Dao. Having attained true Mystery, then Origin becomes wondrous Origin—true Origin cannot be Origin; Spirit becomes wondrous Spirit—true Spirit cannot be Spirit; Authenticity becomes wondrous Authenticity—true Authenticity cannot be Authenticity; Dao becomes wondrous Dao—true Dao cannot be Dao. From the Primordial Origin downward, though all share these five names, the wondrous power attained differs in each, with Mystery alone as the ultimate. Thus it is said: True Mystery is ultimate.\n\n**Chapter Two, One Hundred Forty-Six Characters**\n\nTrue Mystery is the Supreme; the Supreme is true Mystery. The ultimate of Dao cannot be named—it is provisionally called true Mystery. The ultimate of honor cannot be named—it is provisionally called the Supreme. Mystery is ultimate and beyond, thus called true Mystery. The Supreme is ultimate and transcendent, thus called the Supreme true Mystery.\n\nMystery gives rise to Origin; Origin gives rise to Spirit; Spirit gives rise to Authenticity; Authenticity gives rise to Dao; Dao gives rise to virtue; virtue gives rise to subtlety; subtlety gives rise to Mystery; Mystery gives rise to Non-being; Non-being gives rise to Being. Being is Being; Non-being is Non-being. Being and Non-being generate each other; yin and yang mutually transform—great transformation and change.\n\nThe descent of Mystery is called Origin; the descent of Origin is called Spirit; the descent of Spirit is called Authenticity; the descent of Authenticity is called Dao; the descent of Dao is called virtue; the descent of virtue is called subtlety. Subtlety is the lesser Dao. The multitude descend from Dao to virtue, from virtue to subtlety, and enter into Being. Once entering Being, they drift ever farther from the Dao. The perfected person ascends from subtlety back to Mystery, from Mystery into Non-being, from Non-being into Being—desiring to establish, they take Non-being as Being; desiring stillness, they take Being as Non-being. Desiring Being, it arises—heaven and earth do not make it more; desiring Non-being, it returns—Great Emptiness does not make it less. Through Being and Non-being, emerging in yang and entering yin, mutually generating and transforming, like the great changes of transformation.\n\nMystery has no form. Being has Non-being; Non-being has Being. I dwell in the constancy of subtlety and Mystery. The perfected person takes wondrous Non-being as essence and wondrous Being as function. Abiding in stillness is the essence of Non-being; responding endlessly to change is the function of Being. The function of Being arises from the essence of Non-being; the essence of Non-being manifests as the function of Being. Taking Being as subtlety and Non-being as Mystery, thus it is said: I dwell in the constancy of subtlety and Mystery.\n\nLaozi said: \"Constantly without desire, observe its Mystery; constantly with desire, observe its subtlety.\" These two emerge differently yet are called the same—profound. The worldly, embodying Non-being, cannot grasp Being; embodying Being, cannot grasp Non-being. Observing Mystery, they cannot perceive subtlety; observing subtlety, they cannot perceive Mystery. All are confined by forms and instruments, unable to enter and exit between Being and Non-being. The perfected person takes wondrous Non-being as essence, emerging into Being. Though the lesser Dao is not pursued, it is not insufficient to enter Non-being; though embodying Mystery, it is not excessive. For they take Being and Non-being, subtlety and Mystery as constant. Thus subtlety is Mystery; Mystery is subtlety; Being is Non-being; Non-being is Being. Therefore it is said: \"Emerging differently, they are called the same—profound.\"\n\nThe constancy of subtlety and Mystery is called Dao. The constancy of Dao is called Authenticity. The constancy of Authenticity is called Spirit. The constancy of Spirit is called Origin. The constancy of Origin is called Mystery. The constancy of Mystery is called I. Dwelling in the boundless.\n\nThe Mystery of Origin-Mystery is unchanging and unaltered—thus called constant. Subtlety is Being; Mystery is Non-being. Being is also Non-being; Non-being is also Being—this is the constancy of subtlety and Mystery. The constancy of subtlety and Mystery is then Dao. The constancy of Dao is Authenticity. The constancy of Authenticity is Spirit. The constancy of Spirit is Origin. The constancy of Origin is Mystery. The constancy of Mystery is I. Thus abiding in constancy is called without beginning or end.\n\nIt cannot be seen, cannot be heard, cannot be grasped, cannot be possessed, cannot be Origin, cannot be Spirit, cannot be Authenticity, cannot be Dao. Entering the supreme, merging with the boundless—this is true Mystery. The worldly seek Dao through things, desiring it to be seen, heard, grasped, possessed, or not possessed. Those who seek Dao through principle desire it to be Origin, Spirit, Authenticity, or Dao. If Dao could be sought through seeing, hearing, Being, or Non-being, then Dao would be a thing. If Dao could be named as Origin, Authenticity, Spirit, or Dao, then Dao would be principle. The perfected person is not enslaved by things externally nor attached to principle internally. Thus without seeing, they see; without hearing, they hear; without grasping, they hold firm; without Being, they exist; without Non-being, they abide; without Origin, they are Origin; without Spirit, they are Spirit; without Authenticity, they are Authenticity; without Dao, they are Dao. Entering the supreme, merging with the boundless—all cannot be named, thus called true Mystery.\n\n**Chapter Three: One Hundred and Six Sayings**\n\nTrue Mystery is neither sound nor form, yet truly neither sound nor form. Above, it is not bright; below, it is not dim. Mystery is not shape, color, sound, or hearing—yet humans cannot fathom it. In the primordial beginning, embodying the Origin and entering Mystery, they gather dust-like forms and draw them in to form roots. Ears, eyes, nose, tongue, body, and mind divide the single essence of clarity. Inner thoughts scatter; outer senses interact. Hardness, warmth, movement, and activity drive the Four Great Elements and the six senses. As the Four Great Elements shift and connect, external dust turns delusive. If one could grasp the primordial beginning, realizing form and appearance as empty, and sever external dust, then color, fragrance, flavor, and touch would no longer cling to the roots. Seeing color would be as if blind; smelling fragrance, as if wind; tasting flavor, as if wax; feeling touch, as if empty. Once external dust dissolves, the six sense organs suddenly become pure. At the extreme of purity, Mystery unfolds—neither form nor sound. Seeing, hearing, awareness, and knowing arise beyond the senses. Thus, at its utmost height, it is vast yet not bright; at its utmost depth, it is subtle yet not dim. Vague and indistinct, obscure and profound—true Mystery, mysterious truth. Seeing yet not seeing, hearing yet not hearing. Each thing has its primordial beginning, unseen and unheard. Vague and obscure, yet not nothing.\n\nThus, the Buddhist scriptures say: *\"If one sees me in form or seeks me in sound, that person walks the deviant path and cannot see the Tathāgata.\"* The Daoist texts say: *\"That which cannot be seen, cannot be heard—transcending all extremes—is called the Mysterious Dao.\"* What is called Dao, if sought from without, is but a thing and not Dao. Why can humans not know Dao? Because they covet color and chase sound, turned by things. The primordial Mystery of the Origin—what is called unseen and unheard—when deluded, becomes seen and heard, turning away from the Origin.\n\nIn the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra*, the Buddha asked Ānanda: *\"Now observe carefully: from the palaces of the sun and moon to the Seven Golden Mountains, clouds rising, birds flying, wind stirring dust—all things near and far, though differing, are seen by your pure vision. If what you see are things, then you also see my seeing. If seeing the same is called seeing me, then I do not see. Why do you not see what I do not see? Where I do not see, you do not see. If the place is unseen, then it is naturally not a thing—how is it not yours? When you see, it is you, not me. The nature of seeing pervades all—who else but you? Thus, entering to see form, only I alone know it. Each knows their own seeing uniquely; none share the same vision. Therefore, what I see, others cannot see; what I hear, others cannot hear. If hearing the same is called hearing me, then I do not hear. Then they should know—since they do not know, what they hear is not what I hear.\"* Taste, touch, and awareness are likewise. As Zhuang Zhou said of *\"seeing the unique\"*—is this not it?\n\nThe Origin in the Great Mystery—still and silent, boundless and profound, serene and unnameable. All that can be named belongs to names and numbers—duality, not unity. Only the unnameable is Dao. As for Dao’s nearness to form, nothing surpasses Non-being, nothing surpasses Emptiness. Yet Non-being opposes Being, Emptiness opposes Substance—both fall into names and numbers, duality, not unity. Only the unnameable is One. What is called One is Non-being yet not Non-being, Being yet not Being, Emptiness yet not Emptiness, Substance yet not Substance. To the point of transcending Non-being, Being, Emptiness, and Substance—neither Non-being nor Being, neither Emptiness nor Substance—transcending yet not transcending, identical yet not identical. At its utmost, neither identity nor transcendence can be named—only then is it the Mysterious Dao.\n\nStillness is Non-being; boundlessness is eternity. Though Non-being, it is inexhaustibly so; though inexhaustible, still and silent, it cannot be possessed—this is called the Unnameable. Primordial Mystery, Spiritual Mystery, True Mystery, Dao Mystery; the emptiness of Heaven and Earth, the shared Mystery of yin and yang, the united Mystery of sun and moon, the contained Mystery of the Five Phases, the blended Mystery of the Eight Trigrams, the all-pervading Mystery of the myriad things. Things are not completed without Dao; truth is not established without Dao. Thus, the Origin attains Mystery and is Origin; Spirit attains Mystery and is Spirit; Truth attains Mystery and is Truth; Dao attains Mystery and is Dao—this is what is meant by *\"truth is not established without Dao.\"* Heaven and Earth attain Mystery and are formed; yin and yang attain Mystery and divide; sun and moon attain Mystery and shine; the Five Phases attain Mystery and mutually overcome and generate; the Eight Trigrams attain Mystery and mutually propel and agitate; the myriad things attain blended Mystery and live and die. Thus, *\"things are not completed without Dao.\"*\n\nUtterly empty, utterly still—I call it emptiness and stillness. The Mysterious Beginning is not Mystery—it cannot be grasped. The Mysterious Body is my Origin. Utter emptiness, extreme stillness. The utmost of emptiness does not empty Being and Non-being; the utmost of stillness does not still movement. If I say emptiness and stillness, then there is a mind for emptiness and stillness. Encountering Being, it is not empty; encountering movement, it is not still. The Mysterious Beginning is not Mystery—Mystery cannot be grasped. Only by embodying my Origin, knowing that Being and Non-being are not empty, knowing that movement is not unstilled—this is the Dao of the Origin.\n\n**Chapter Four: Sixty-Four Sayings**\n\nWho attains the Origin through the Origin? Who attains Spirit through Spirit? Who attains Truth through Truth? Who attains Dao through Dao? Who attains names through names? I boldly say: Mystery enters my Mystery. Knowing the Origin and guarding the Origin, the Origin is no longer Origin. Knowing Spirit and guarding Spirit, Spirit is no longer Spirit. Knowing Truth and guarding Truth, Truth is no longer Truth. Knowing Dao and guarding Dao, Dao is no longer Dao. Knowing knowledge and guarding knowledge—this is attachment.\n\nKnowing knowledge as no-knowledge—only then are the six penetrations achieved. The four unfoldings reside in Origin; it is not that Origin resides in Spirit, nor that Spirit resides in Truth, nor that Truth resides in Dao. Dao is not named; names are not forced—this is called: subtly as the elusive, subtly entering my subtlety. Only then is it united as Origin, dispersed as Spirit, concentrated as One into Truth, transformed myriadly as Dao. Rising with the pure and descending with the turbid, arraying essence and soul, the Dao of transformation exhausts images and extremes of form, returning to subtlety. Origin takes subtlety as its body; thus Origin is the union of subtlety, Spirit is the dispersion of subtlety, Truth is the oneness of subtlety, and Dao is the transformation of subtlety. Down to the division of yin and yang, the descent of the turbid and ascent of the pure, the arraying of essence and soul—all things are completed, all issuing from subtlety. First emerging from subtlety, exhausting its transformations, grasses and trees, insects, water and fire, earth and wood—exhausting images and extremes of form—all are my subtlety. Things spontaneously follow to be born; Dao spontaneously returns to be completed. If one can return from images and forms to their source, all can attain subtlety.\n\n**Chapter Five: Ninety-Eight Sayings**\n\nI begin with subtlety—myriad spirits are not spirit, myriad dharmas are not named, myriad realms are not born. Not that they are not spirit—subtle spirit has no illumination. Not that they are not named—subtle dharma has no cause. Not that they are not born—subtle realm has no condition. Subtlety upon subtlety has no opposite—this is called independence. Why is subtle spirit without spirit? Because spirit has no direction. Why is subtle dharma without name? Because dharma has no dharma. Why is subtle realm without existence? Because it has no condition. The subtlety of the Origin is profoundly still and self-illuminating; without illumination, there is no illuminator, no dharma, no name. Detached from all arising and ceasing, causes do not produce effects; since causes do not produce, conditions have no counterpart. Thus all dusts and images cannot be completed—purely through subtle clarity. Subtlety upon subtlety has no opposite—this is called independence. Neither child nor grandchild, it is one with non-solitude. Flowing in and out endlessly, it is one with no gate. Myriad things return to Origin, yet its governance is unseen. Neither child nor grandchild, its transmission is inexhaustible—thus it is not solitary. Flowing in and out endlessly, its bounds are unknown—thus it has no gate. Though it governs myriad things, and myriad things return to it, none see how it governs. I begin with subtlety—still, vast, continuous, profound, expansive—I know not its arising. Thus it is called: the Dao of long life. Where there is birth, there is death; only where there is no birth is there long life. The subtlety of the Origin does not arise from arising—thus I know not its arising. Only stillness is seen as vast, continuity as enduring, profundity as abiding, expansiveness as boundless. Thus it is named: the Dao of long life.\n\n**Chapter Six: One Hundred and Sixty Sayings**\n\nThe spontaneous is not subtlety; subtlety is not the spontaneous—I originate from subtlety. Above, it is not bright—dimly, vaguely; below, it is not dark—vaguely, dimly. Dim and vague, obscure and indistinct, above and below are one in subtlety. Subtle dimness, subtle vagueness—neither image nor thing. The spontaneous can be named Dao, yet Dao is not the spontaneous. Why? The spontaneous has a fixed body, while Dao has no fixed body. If Dao were taken as the spontaneous, then Dao should not descend to generate things. If things were taken as the spontaneous, then things should not transform to become Dao. Thus it is said: the spontaneous is not subtlety; subtlety is not the spontaneous. The subtlety of the Origin dwells between being and non-being. Dimness is brightness, being; vagueness is extinction, non-being. At the extreme of subtlety, its greatness is not seen as bright—having emerged into being, yet still and non-being—thus it is called dimly, vaguely. At its smallest, its darkness is not seen—dwelling in non-being, yet emerging into being—thus it is called vaguely, dimly. Dim and vague, obscure and indistinct, emerging and entering between being and non-being, above and below alike in subtlety—thus it is called subtle dimness, subtle vagueness, neither image nor thing. I begin with Origin—subtly vague, subtly dim, neither thing nor image. I begin with Spirit—profoundly obscure, profoundly dark, neither subtlety nor form. I begin with Truth—darkly obscure, obscurely profound, neither form nor subtlety. I begin with Dao—essence contains truth, the spontaneous Dao. Origin, Spirit, and Truth are divisions of subtlety, yet do not exhaust its body—all are neither thing nor image, dwelling between dimness, vagueness, obscurity, and darkness. As for Dao, only then is there essence, only then is there truth—neither obscure nor dark, neither dim nor vague—yet still not detached from the spontaneous. Descending from Dao, essence disperses into form, truth descends into things—things arise, and Dao’s spontaneity is lost. Dao follows the spontaneous; the spontaneous is the true Dao. \"True\" is the designation of the spontaneous. The five mouths know not its spontaneity. The spontaneous is true; truth is the Dao of the spontaneous. Thus it is said: Dao follows the spontaneous. The so-called spontaneity of Dao and the spontaneity of things share the same name but differ in meaning. What the world calls spontaneous is a term for non-change. When deluded and without wisdom, clinging to the existence of things as spontaneous, failing to discern the original body of the spontaneous—then this spontaneity deeply obstructs Dao, and the sage rejects it. This is the intent behind the opening lines: the spontaneous is not subtlety; subtlety is not the spontaneous. The so-called spontaneity of Dao is that when Dao descends to become things, its self remains unchanging—this is the spontaneity of Dao. What the world calls spontaneous is the self of things, such as the whiteness of swans or the blackness of crows. Lacking knowledge, they take black and white as the self of crows and swans, not knowing why swans are white or crows are black. There is also that which makes them so—this is not self. Since the world takes the non-self as self and the non-so as so, the sage avoids such terms.\n\nThough the sage has mastered the subtleties of Dao and understands the nature of spontaneity, when discoursing on Dao, they still say, \"I do not know its spontaneity.\" For to claim knowledge of it is to impose spontaneity upon it—this is no longer spontaneity. How much less can those who rely on worldly sentiments, deluded thoughts, and speculative conjectures fathom it?\n\nThe true follows the numinous, the numinous follows the origin, the origin follows the subtle. The subtle has no method, and thus it is the source of the myriad methods. Without method as method, without origin as origin, without numinous as numinous, without true as true, without Dao as Dao, without nothingness as nothingness, without being as being—this is my utmost subtlety, entering the subtlety of the primordial origin. If there is something to follow, then there is something not yet attained. Thus, the true cannot but follow the numinous, the numinous cannot but follow the origin, and the origin cannot but follow the subtle. Only when one reaches the utmost subtlety is there no method to follow. Precisely because it has no method, it is the source of the myriad things. As such, there is no method, no origin, no numinous, no true, no Dao, no nothingness, no being. Only those who embody subtlety can attain this. Thus, the *Dharmapada* of the *Śākya Transmission* states:\n\n*The Dharma is originally Dharma without Dharma,\nWithout Dharma, Dharma is still Dharma.\nNow, when no-Dharma is transmitted,\nWhat Dharma has ever been Dharma?*\n\n**Chapter Seven, One Hundred and Twenty Characters**\n\nThe utmost subtlety is without interval, without beginning, without limit, without end, without bounds, without center.\nWithout interval yet not without interval, without beginning yet not without beginning, without limit yet not without limit, without end yet not without end, without bounds yet not without bounds, without center yet not without center.\nWithout interval—one does not see its severance.\nWithout beginning—one does not see its precedence.\nWithout limit—one does not see its above.\nWithout end—one does not see its conclusion.\nWithout bounds—one does not see its edge.\nWithout center—one does not see its expanse.\n\nThough without interval, continuity and discontinuity are insufficient to name Dao, thus there is also no \"without interval.\"\nThough without beginning, before and after are insufficient to name Dao, thus there is also no \"without beginning.\"\nThough without limit, above and below are insufficient to name Dao, thus there is also no \"without limit.\"\nThough without end, beginning and end are insufficient to name Dao, thus there is also no \"without end.\"\nThough without bounds, edge and center are insufficient to name Dao, thus there is also no \"without bounds.\"\nThough without center, expanse and narrowness are insufficient to name Dao, thus there is also no \"without center.\"\nExhausting all the world’s words is still insufficient to name Dao, thus the Great Dao is nameless.\n\nMy beginning is without center—being and nothingness are one body.\nMy beginning is without bounds—it merges with the primordial subtle.\nHeaven and earth, the six directions—great and small are one subtlety.\nThe subtle roams through great and small—who can perceive its essence?\n\nThe so-called \"without center\" is not merely emptiness without bounds; it must have being and nothingness as one body, void and full mutually pervading—only then is it without center.\nThe so-called \"without bounds\" is not merely boundless vastness; it must merge with the primordial subtle, great and small as one—only then is it without bounds.\nThus, vast as heaven and earth, expansive as the six directions, immense as the void, minute as a speck of dust—all are one subtlety. Therefore, the subtle roams in and out of heaven and earth, rests within a speck of dust, circulates through the void, upholds the six directions—who knows its essence, who exhausts its subtlety?\n\nI say: without form, without sound, without name.\nMy beginning is subtle, my middle is subtle—the subtlety of the three nones.\nMy primordial origin is the utmost Dao—this is called ultimate bliss.\nThe vessel of subtle roaming contains and embraces, accompanying heaven, earth, and the myriad things to their end, yet it is inexhaustible in its extremity.\nBecause it does not take form as form, it is without form; because it does not take sound as sound, it is without sound; because it does not take name as name, it is without name.\nThe subtle enters without sequence, yet the subtle has sequence—thus there is the subtlety of the beginning, the subtlety of the middle, and the utmost subtlety of the three nones. This is the primordial origin, the utmost Dao, ultimate bliss.\nThe subtle roaming is all-embracing, all-containing, accompanying heaven, earth, and the myriad things to their end. Yet the subtle has no end, thus it is said to be inexhaustible in its extremity.\n\n**Chapter Eight, Forty-Four Characters**\n\nThe subtle accompanies heaven, earth, and the myriad things to their end—yet my end is without end.\nThe subtle accompanies heaven, earth, and the myriad things to their origin—yet my origin is without origin.\nVirtue roams within it—heaven, earth, and the myriad things cannot be perceived.\nVirtue roams in the utmost subtlety and returns with things.\nThe subtle accompanies things to their end, yet the subtle has no end.\nThe subtle accompanies things to their origin, yet the subtle has no origin.\nThe subtle roams within things, yet things cannot know it.\nThus it is said: \"Virtue roams\" refers to things.\nThe true person embodies the subtle and roams among things—this is subtle roaming.\nThings attain the subtle, and the subtle resides within things—this is virtue roaming.\nThings have decay, yet the subtle has no decay—thus it is said to return with things.\n\n**Chapter Nine, Forty-Two Characters**\n\nThe subtle roams without obstruction, the origin roams without knowledge, the numinous roams without direction, the true roams without change, Dao roams without form, virtue roams without name, things roam without interval.\nThis is called roaming with things—here the Dao of life and death is exhausted.\nSubtlety, origin, numinous, true, Dao—these five are names of Dao.\nYet only when there is roaming within these five is it called Dao.\nDao is my original true nature—it is called the beginning of the primordial origin.\nRoaming in subtlety is without obstruction, roaming in origin is without knowledge, roaming in the numinous is without direction, roaming in the true is without change, roaming in Dao is without form.\nDescending further to roam in virtue, it cannot be named by virtue.\nRefining to roam among things, it cannot be bounded by things.\nIn its essence, roaming with the subtle, it cannot be seen.\nIn its coarseness, roaming with things, it cannot be concealed.\nThis is how the utmost person enters life and death, treating them as the constant alternation of morning and evening.\n\n*Commentary on the Primordial Origin’s Precelestial Dao and Virtue, Scroll One—Concluded*\n*Commentary on the Primordial Origin’s Precelestial Dao and Virtue, Scroll Two*\n\n**Scroll Two, Chapter of One Thousand Words – First Section (159 characters)**\n\nSubtle and origin intermingle, numinous and origin merge as one, true and origin unite, Dao and origin return to the source, virtue and origin revert to subtlety—thus do things return to their root.\nSubtlety, origin, numinous, true, and Dao—each possesses depths and shallows, marking the measure of those who cultivate the Way.\nThis origin’s subtlety is not the subtlety of subtlety.\nThis origin’s numinous is not the numinous of subtlety.\nThis origin’s true is not the true of subtlety.\nThis origin’s Dao is not the Dao of subtlety.\nThis origin’s virtue is not the virtue of subtlety.\nThe multitude scatter their virtue and become things; the perfected person returns virtue to subtlety. Dao returns to things, things return to Dao—thus it is said: following it, one becomes human; reversing it, one attains Dao.\n\nOrigin is not origin—it precedes form.\nForm is not form—it coalesces in undifferentiated oneness.\nSubtle-origin is indistinct and vague, suddenly manifesting as image.\nSubtle-origin is vague and indistinct, suddenly manifesting as thing.\nThings and images emerge from profound obscurity, suddenly bearing essence.\nEssence contains the numinous, the numinous unites as the true.\nThis is not the color of color—pristine simplicity holds luminosity.\nThis is not the form of form, not the image of image.\nWhat makes origin *origin* is not origin—it is the beginning of subtle form.\nWhat makes form *form* is not form—it coalesces in undifferentiated oneness.\nDao descends from subtlety to origin, first assuming indistinct and vague appearances. Thus it is said: subtle-origin is indistinct and vague, suddenly manifesting as image; subtle-origin is vague and indistinct, suddenly manifesting as thing.\nThings and images arise from profound obscurity, yet within them abides the purest essence.\nEssence gathers as the numinous, the numinous unites as the true—this is the essence of origin.\nThus its essence possesses luminosity and color, image and form. This color and luminosity, form and image, reside within our primordial, uncontrived nature.\nYet with the slightest stirring of the mind, one grasps at dust-like images. Dust accumulates into roots, and the original image and luminosity are lost.\nThe perfected person transcends the roots of perception and restores primordial luminosity.\nThus they perceive not the color of color—pristine simplicity holds luminosity; not the form of form, not the image of image.\n\nThe great image of origin is vast and boundless, its radiance profound.\nThe harmony of origin resounds—only origin alone hears it.\nThe form of origin’s image—only origin alone sees it.\nThe image of origin is not the image of things. Its vast and profound radiance cannot be glimpsed by things. Thus the harmony of origin is heard only by origin alone; the form of origin’s image is seen only by origin alone.\n\nThe origin of origin is the true ancestor, the true mother.\nThe emperor precedes the beginning of Dao; the origin is the primal record of images.\nI begin with origin-origin, originating from the primal record, returning to my beginning—I do not see myself.\nWho declares my origin as the primordial beginning? This is called the beginning and end, the origin of the primal record.\nSubtlety cannot be seen, but in the primordial beginning, there are gradual signs of visibility. Thus the origin of origin is called the true ancestor, the true mother.\nThe emperor precedes the beginning of Dao; at the inception of images, the record of Dao first reveals a trace.\nThus I begin with origin, gradually assuming a recordable form.\nThough gradually recordable, I return to the beginning.\nI do not even know my own beginning—how much less others?\nThis is called the origin of the primal record of beginning and end.\nTo speak of beginning and end: Dao in its origin has the name of beginning.\nThings end and are exhausted.\nThe origin of the primal record begins with origin and ends with origin—origin-origin is inexhaustible.\nWithout beginning or end—this is the origin of the primal record.\n\n**Second Section (114 characters)**\n\nOrigin-origin is the womb-light, the beginning of the nine origins, preceding the eight trigrams.\nWomb-light is the primal origin—bright, radiant, indistinct, vague.\nOrigin-origin’s primal light gives rise to true being.\nThe perfected person emerges from subtlety into origin, gradually revealing signs of light.\nOf humanity’s three souls, one is womb-light—thus origin-origin is womb-light.\nAll numbers end at nine; ten reverts to one.\nThus the great number culminates at nine, and all nine numbers arise from origin—hence the nine origins.\nThe beginning of the nine origins is the one.\nPreceding the eight trigrams, Qian and Kun are the ancestors of yin and yang. In the *Book of Changes*, this is the Supreme Ultimate; in Qian, it is origin; in humanity, it is womb-light.\nWomb-light is the primal origin—bright, radiant, indistinct, vague—all referring to the primal light of origin.\nThings, from their inception in light, lose the root of Dao. Thus Buddhist texts call it \"primal luminosity\"—hence *primal luminosity*.\nIlluminating the place of arising, the place of arising establishes illumination. When nature perishes—if the perfected person begins with the subtlety of non-being and emerges into the subtlety of being, then from subtlety descending, the coarse Dao arises from origin, while subtlety remains numinous—this is their difference.\nThus it is said: subtlety gives birth to true being.\n\nOrigin reveals, origin conceals—the great image within the millet-pearl.\nOrigin arises, origin vanishes—the great thing within the millet-pearl.\nOrigin, through the great image, contains all images.\nOrigin, through the great thing, encompasses all things.\nWhen things attain form, they cannot enter the minute with the vast or conceal the vast within the minute.\nOrigin, rooted in nature and not yet entering form, can reveal or conceal—like the dreaming soul wandering within the body, where mountains, rivers, and the great earth are all present, and all beings and affairs are manifest.\nIf one meets through form, two millets cannot contain each other.\nIf one meets through nature, the great image within the millet-pearl is no marvel.\nFor the great image is not image—thus it contains all images.\nThe great thing is not thing—thus it encompasses all things.\nThe sage, having expounded this principle, occasionally reveals its traces to awaken future generations.\nThey seek to dispel the ignorance of those who cling to coarse forms, yet when extraordinary transformations are witnessed, some dismiss them as deceptive illusions.\nThis is why the followers of the Buddha distance themselves from worldly discourse—is this not the reason?\n\nThe image within image is not the primordial; the thing within thing is not the one.\nThe image within image is the primordial yet not the primordial; the thing within thing is the one yet not the one.\nWhy is this so?\nThe marvelous power of the primordial enables those not yet primordial to transform in accord with the primordial.\nThe marvelous power of the one enables those not yet one to dwell in unity.\nThis is how the sage perfects the self and, in turn, perfects all things.\n\nThe great image lies hidden within the millet-pearl, yet the great image is not necessarily wholly primordial.\nThough it has not attained the primordial, when my primordial is applied to its primordial, it too transforms by the primordial.\nLike Li Guang shooting the tiger, unaware it was stone; like Zhou Chu slaying the dragon, unaware it was water.\nWith a heart that has reached the one, even stone and water follow and transform—how much more can my marvelous primordial transform all things?\nThus it is said: the primordial is not the primordial; the one is not the one.\n\nThe primordial of the primordial image naturally contains radiance—what I call \"image\" is the primordial womb of radiance.\nThe inception of the primordial womb naturally contains radiance.\nBuddhists call it *awakened luminosity*; Daoists call it *womb radiance*.\nBuddhists’ *awakened luminosity* is termed \"realm\"; Daoists’ *womb radiance* is termed \"image.\"\nWhen inherent nature awakens, it must be luminous; when luminous, the realm vanishes.\nWhen the primordial womb is radiant, radiance becomes the marvelous image.\nDelusion establishes luminous awakening; awakening dissolves the image to form.\nThe womb radiance radiates the Buddha—awakened luminosity is luminous yet without realm; womb radiance is radiant yet the image is marvelous.\nThe image of the marvelous image, the luminosity of awakened luminosity—this is the root of the Dao.\n\nThe true primordial of things precedes the primordial mother.\nThe Dao begets the Dao—yet I cannot beget myself; I am the mother of the primordial primordial.\nThe true primordial of things is not the primordial.\nOnly when rooted in the marvelous does the primordial arise—thus it is said to precede the primordial mother.\nThe primordial mother is the marvelous.\nWhen the marvelous begets the primordial, the primordial descends to beget the Dao.\nTo elaborate: the primordial begets the true; the true begets the numinous; only then does the Dao arise.\nThough it reaches the Dao, it further descends to beget all things.\nIf one traces their arising, it is not so—nothing is self-generated.\nIf one traces their origin, it must be the mother of the primordial primordial, the inception of the marvelous—only then can they beget all things.\nWhat is called the marvelous is the inception that is thus, thus, unattainable by birth and death.\n\n**Chapter Three: One Hundred Words**\nWomb radiance, primordial primordial—primordial primordial, womb radiance.\nMy inception is primordial primordial.\nThe spirit sees yet does not see; the spirit hears yet does not hear; the spirit meets the spirit yet does not meet; the spirit cannot be attained.\nThus it is said: only through the spirit can one know the inception.\nAt the inception of womb radiance, no trace is seen, no sound is heard.\nEach knows for itself; none see one another—thus it is said the spirit meets the spirit yet does not meet.\nThis is called \"not the same as this not-sameness\"; all things are thus.\nYet things cannot be sovereign because their spirit is incomplete and is turned by things.\nAt this time, though the six senses have not yet engaged with sound, form, scent, or taste, the six kinds of perceptual consciousness already reside within the womb radiance of the primordial primordial.\nThe perfected one takes the spirit as sovereign, so the six kinds of perceptual consciousness do not follow the sense roots and dusts but are all transformed by the spirit into a single luminous clarity.\nThe multitude’s spirit-mirror is incomplete; the six kinds of perceptual consciousness, weighted, are first received.\nOnce transmitted to a sense root, they share the root’s defilement, sinking into birth and death, and the womb radiance grows faint.\nThus it is said: only through the spirit can one know the inception.\n\nMy inception is in the primordial primordial—boundless, marvelous heaven, inhaling radiance to transform into the marvelous.\nThe primordial primordial is my inception; the marvelous mother opens the gate, riding radiance to continue the primordial.\nIts function lies in the indistinct; the Dao lies in the ceaseless.\nMencius said: \"He who exhausts his heart knows his nature; knowing his nature, he knows Heaven.\"\nAccording to Mencius, beyond the heart lies nature, and beyond nature lies Heaven.\nThe *Book of Changes* says: \"Exhaust principle, fulfill nature, to reach destiny.\"\nAccording to the *Changes*, beyond principle lies nature, and beyond nature lies destiny.\nMencius’ Heaven is the *Changes*’ destiny.\nThe enlightened of old sometimes called it *seeing the solitary*, sometimes *the land of nothing whatsoever*—the utmost of worldly speech goes no further.\nYet where is this Heaven? What is this destiny?\nThis *Scripture* calls it *boundless marvelous heaven*.\nWhen womb radiance abides in the primordial primordial, it shines alone, resplendent.\nI know not its place, nor its bounds—is this not boundless marvelous heaven?\nWhen the sense roots and dusts dissolve, inhaling radiance transforms into the marvelous—spirit’s function is unfathomable.\nThe gateway of the myriad marvels opens; riding radiance, it continues the primordial.\nThe ten thousand spirits arise of themselves; its function lies in the indistinct, ungraspable.\nThe Dao lies in the ceaseless, unbroken.\nWho but the most spiritually attuned under heaven could partake in this?\n\nNo grasping, no relinquishing—non-action, spontaneity.\nI know not its spontaneity.\nThe primordial inception begets the primordial; all coalesces in undifferentiated oneness.\nThe marvelous reaches the primordial; the primordial inception is spontaneous.\nWithin the primordial primordial, inhaling radiance transforms into the marvelous.\nThe myriad spirits arise in undifferentiated oneness, riding radiance in the indistinct.\nThe marvelous unfolds—neither relinquishing the absent to grasp the present, nor discarding the present to grasp the absent.\nAll is the function of non-action and spontaneity.\nI know not its self; I know not its thusness.\nAll coalesces to form the primordial; the marvelous reaches the primordial.\nThus it is said: the Dao of the primordial inception is spontaneous.\nSo it is marvelous—both the primordial primordial and the marvelous.\n\n**Chapter Four: One Hundred Twenty-Six Words**\nClear and turbid intermingle; yin and yang are one primordial.\nNot clear yet clear—the primordial clear begets the turbid.\nNot turbid yet turbid—the primordial turbid begets the clear.\nNot yin yet primordial yin; not yang yet primordial yang.\nThe primordial Dao abides here—yin and yang arise together; who can name clear and turbid?\n\n**Primordial Clear and Primordial Turbid—so too are yin and yang.**\nThe Primordial is where clear and turbid first intermingle, yet yin and yang remain undivided, coalescing as one primordial unity. As the *Yi* says: \"One yin, one yang—this is called the Dao.\" \"One yin, one yang\" refers precisely to the state before yin and yang separate. From this undivided yin-yang arises goodness; from goodness, then, arises nature. Only when nature is established do things take form. Never has there been a world where nature was unformed yet goodness already complete. Thus, what the *Yi* calls the Dao and what it calls goodness both precede things—they are not terms for good and evil.\n\nWhen clear and turbid intermingle and yin and yang share a single primordial source, they are neither clear nor turbid, neither yin nor yang. They merge through nature, not through form. Thus, primordial clear contains turbid; primordial turbid contains clear; primordial yang contains yin; primordial yin contains yang—like water and fire that do not repel each other. Clear and turbid share a single source; yin and yang arise together. Who can name them?\n\nMarvelous images and primordial images, marvelous sounds and primordial sounds—sounds and images cannot encompass the root of the myriad things, the spirit of the myriad things. What I call \"one\" is not one, yet one remains unmanifest. What I call \"primordial\" is not yet primordial, yet the primordial is not yet constant. Marvelous images and marvelous sounds—only the solitary listener may hear them; only the solitary seer may see them. Their sounds and images are not images—what people may see or hear. Thus they are the root of the myriad things, the spirit of the myriad things, for in their primordial state they are called the beginning of numbers, the ancestor of the One. Yet in truth, they remain unmanifest; the One is not yet visible. They are called the beginning of form, the ancestor of constancy. Yet their form is unseen, and constancy is not yet constant.\n\nThe sage embodies this and calls it the Nameless. The Primordial One contains the marvelous; the marvelous Primordial flows with radiance. Flowing radiance contains qi; this is the constancy of the Primordial Marvelous. I say: the Dao of primordial constancy models itself on primordial constancy.\n\nQi, form, and number—these three reside within marvelous being. They are neither being nor non-being. Flowing radiance becomes qi; qi congeals into form; form appears as number. The perfected ones of antiquity embodied marvelous non-being and emerged as marvelous being. How could these three ever be absent? Yet in the end, they are not being. For the qi of flowing radiance is not stirred by yin and yang; the form of marvelous qi is not fabricated by artificial combination; the number revealed in form cannot be sought in one or two.\n\nThus, entering, it becomes the Great Void; emerging, it becomes marvelous being. Dispersing form and scattering qi into a thousand myriad shapes does not make it excessive. Gathering its luminous trace and absorbing its radiance, closing and concealing its form, does not make it deficient. This is called the constancy of the Primordial Marvelous. The Dao models itself on primordial constancy—thus it cannot be questioned.\n\n**Chapter Five: One Hundred Sixty-Six Words**\n\nThe marvelousness of yin and yang, the profundity of clear and turbid—profound and marvelous give rise to the Primordial through mutual dependence. Yin and yang sharing a single source is called the marvelous; clear and turbid containing each other is called the profound. Yin and yang unite through qi; clear and turbid merge through form. Marvelous qi is as if without qi; marvelous form is as if without form. Thus it is said: the profound and the marvelous give rise to one another.\n\nThe Primordial contains the myriad images; the myriad images contain the Primordial. The myriad images give birth to the Primordial Primordial; the Primordial Primordial gives birth to the myriad images. The Primordial contains the myriad images, yet it is not form. The myriad images arise from the Primordial, yet they are not things.\n\nThe perfected ones of antiquity turned inward and attained sincerity—then the myriad things were all complete within them. By attaining the Center and Harmony, they stood with Heaven and Earth and nurtured the myriad things, all within their own Center and Harmony. The Buddhists speak of the \"mind-made body\"—the body arises following the mind, not through artificial fabrication. This is like the Daoists' \"eight radiant luminances of the spirit-light,\" where the myriad spirits intermingle and arise as the mind wills, swift and unhindered, even to the point of generating entire species, with nothing lacking and beyond reckoning. This is what is meant by the Primordial Primordial giving birth to the myriad images.\n\nThe spirit does not know the spirit; the true does not know the true; the Dao does not know the Dao. I originate from the Void and Non-being. The Dao is hidden, without name; the true is hidden, without form; the spirit is hidden, without numinosity. My spirit is luminous and numinous; my true is profound and refined. The spirit is hidden, without numinosity—yet without numinosity, it attains the utmost spirit. The true is hidden, without form—yet without form, it attains the utmost true. The Dao is hidden, without name—yet without name, it attains the utmost Dao. The Three Absences merge into the Primordial.\n\nThe marvelousness of the Primordial lies in the spirit hidden without numinosity, the true hidden without form, the Dao hidden without name. Thus, without numinosity is the true spirit; without form is the true true; without name is the true Dao. Therefore, it is said: the Three Absences are the Primordial.\n\nThe unfolding of these five chapters is not an arbitrary ordering by the sage. The marvelous, in the Dao, is the ultimate of sageliness; in humans, it is the beginning of the hun-soul. It is neither image nor thing, neither dying nor living—this is my original beginning, what is called the marvelous. The Primordial follows the marvelous; in humans, it is the fetal radiance. The spirit follows the Primordial; in humans, it is the luminous numen. The true follows the spirit; in humans, it is the profound essence.\n\nBelow this lies the Dao. From the Dao downward, nature is formed and shape is complete. Thus, the three hun-souls of humans—first, the fetal radiance; second, the luminous numen; third, the profound essence—derive their meaning from this. As the *Yi* says: \"Essence-qi becomes things; the wandering hun-soul becomes transformation.\" When essence-qi becomes things, substance is complete and the body is formed. With formation comes decay; things cannot be enduring. Only the hun-soul wanders among things—when things decay, the hun-soul does not perish. Thus the *Yi* calls it transformation.\n\nThe sages of antiquity deeply and clearly expounded this to instruct people. Thus, the marvelous lies above the hun-soul, while the Dao lies below it. The marvelous precedes the hun-soul; the Dao descends from it. Below the Dao, the sage does not dwell. Above the Dao, the multitude does not reside.\n\nThe reason the multitude is born and dies, dies and is born, is that the Dao descends into the po-soul, and when the po-soul flourishes, the hun-soul wanes. The sage’s hun-soul flourishes while the po-soul vanishes—thus they wander together with the Dao.\n\nThe multitude’s po-soul flourishes while the hun-soul perishes—thus they perish together with things. From this perspective, the so-called \"three hun-souls\" are precisely this primordial spirit, true and authentic. The \"seven po-souls\" are joy, anger, sorrow, fear, love, aversion, and desire. When the hun-soul is whole, one becomes an immortal; when the po-soul is whole, one becomes a ghost. When hun-soul and po-soul stand in balance, one becomes human. This is the natural principle, and even if the sages were to rise again, they would not alter my words.\n\nThough the sage embodies the hun-soul and the multitude embodies the po-soul, this is spoken of only after their formation. As for the primordial beginning, when hun-soul and po-soul were undivided and the clear and turbid had not yet separated, who could distinguish which was hun and which was po? Once divided, wholeness becomes hun, dispersion becomes po; ascent becomes hun, descent becomes po; uprightness becomes hun, perversion becomes po; truth becomes hun, falsehood becomes po. Their root is the same, but their ends differ—thus the po-soul is also the hun-soul, and the hun-soul is also the po-soul. When the po-soul dissolves, it becomes hun; when the hun-soul dissolves, it becomes po. What the Buddhists call \"ignorance is Buddha-nature\" refers precisely to this.\n\nMy primordial Dao of the primordial beginning revolves in ineffable mystery, yet this mystery cannot be grasped. Naturally primordial and wondrous, it ascends and descends, revolving of itself—I begin from the primordial of the primordial. I know not its natural primordial Dao and primordial virtue. Who can embody my primordial Dao and primordial virtue, returning to my primordial beginning? This is the Way of returning to the origin and reverting to the root, fully realized.\n\nThe sage embodies the Dao of the primordial beginning, revolving among things, concealing marvelousness within form and traces. Harmonizing its light, blending with the dust, it cannot be said to lack marvelousness, nor can marvelousness be ascribed to it. It dwells within form and traces, yet even form and traces are marvelous—thus its marvelousness cannot be grasped. Ascending and descending, revolving through worldly affairs, naturally primordial and wondrous, yet its subtlety is unseen. For my original essence is the primordial body of the primordial beginning, and I respond naturally to things, yet I know not this naturalness. Thus not only does the primordial Dao transform into marvelousness, but primordial virtue also transforms into marvelousness. From the vast to the minute, from the heart to its traces, all is marvelous—who can comprehend it? Therefore, though I embody the Dao and virtue to transcend the world, I return them to the primordial beginning. This is the Way of returning to the origin and reverting to the root, fully realized.\n\n**Chapter Six (One Hundred Forty-Eight Characters)**\n\nThe primordial generates spirit; spirit generates the primordial.\nThe primordial descends to become spirit; spirit unites to become the primordial.\nSpirit is numinous through the primordial; the primordial is manifest through spirit.\nThus above and below generate one another.\n\nMy primordial essence is pure; the primordial One revolves and generates. Before primordial colors unfold, there is only dim obscurity. Azure, white, vermilion, and yellow-green contain the four images, and the four images hold light. Azure, white, vermilion, and yellow-green form the four images—here, the profound is not spoken of. The profound is the mother of colors; colorlessness is the profound. Before primordial colors unfold, their light is profoundly dark. The primordial One is what is called the profound.\n\nFrom the primordial One revolving, the five primordials are born—thus Heaven’s One becomes water. Heaven generates water within, water floats Heaven and bears Earth. Before the primordial unfolds, within the great profound, there naturally exists the light of azure, white, vermilion, and yellow-green, uniting to form the four images and five primordials in dim obscurity.\n\nMy marvelousness of the primordial beginning employs the primordial One, yet is not the primordial One—it is the marvelousness of the primordial One. Marvelousness generates the primordial; the primordial generates marvelousness. Marvelousness is the ancestor of the primordial; the primordial is the function of marvelousness. From marvelousness entering the primordial, it is called the primordial One. The function of the primordial One is the mutual generation of primordial and marvelousness—one knows not marvelousness as primordial, nor primordial as marvelousness.\n\nAzure and white alternate in concealment and revelation, left and right mutually primordial. Primordial light is dim and obscure; the primordial emerges and enters, emerging and entering without gate—I know not its primordial. Vermilion and profound ascend and descend, neither bright nor dark. Above and below are one primordial, the primordial following nature.\n\nAzure is the qi-color of wood in the East; white is the qi-color of metal in the West. Wood is left, metal is right—thus it is said left and right are mutually primordial. Vermilion is the qi-color of fire in the South; profound is the qi-color of water in the North. Fire ascends, water descends—thus it is said vermilion and profound ascend and descend. Primordial light is dim and obscure; in the East and West, azure and white emerge and enter, yet their gate is unseen. In the South and North, profound and vermilion ascend and descend, yet their brightness and obscurity are unapparent. There is emergence and entry without visible emergence or entry, brightness and obscurity without visible brightness or obscurity—thus the spirit’s function has no gate, and the Dao follows nature.\n\nNon-action is natural; naturalness is non-action. The Dao precedes dim obscurity; the primordial precedes primordial non-action—who can embody my non-action and naturalness? The primordial arises from non-action; non-action arises from the primordial. From the primordial, naturalness is born—I know not how this is so.\n\nMy primordial beginning is the Heaven of non-action. In the Heaven of non-action, there is azure yet not wood, white yet not metal, vermilion yet not fire, profound yet not water, yellow-green yet not earth. There is left and right, yet neither left nor right; there is above and below, yet neither above nor below.\n\nThere is emergence and entry, yet neither emergence nor entry. There is brightness and obscurity, yet neither brightness nor obscurity. There is color yet no color, form yet no form, naturalness yet no naturalness, non-action yet no non-action—thus it is said: who can embody my non-action and naturalness? It is also said: the primordial gives birth to naturalness, yet I know not how this is so. This is called the Heaven of non-action.\n\n**Chapter Seven: Twenty Words**\nThere is being and non-being, above and below, left and right, inner and outer, dim obscurity and profound darkness—within the wondrous midst, the primordial resides therein. All things must possess the reckoning of being and non-being, the positions of above and below, the distinctions of left and right, the boundaries of inner and outer. What things cannot escape is the wondrous; within the wondrous, the primordial abides in their midst. It is neither being nor non-being, neither above nor below, neither left nor right, neither inner nor outer—dim and obscure, profound and dark, untouched by these eight.\n\n**Chapter Eight: One Hundred Fifty Words**\nThe primordial and the yellow begin in the wondrous; the wondrous arises from their mutual dependence. The primordial depends on the yellow, the yellow depends on the primordial; the primordial begins with the yellow, the yellow begins with the primordial—I know not their origin. In terms of the Dao, it is called the primordial; in terms of color, it is called the profound. Thus, the primordial is also the profound. The primordial of Heaven and the yellow of Earth both depend on the root of the wondrous beginning. The primordial depends on the yellow, the yellow depends on the primordial; they mutually depend, mutually give rise—primordial beginning and yellow beginning, I know not their origin, for what is called \"origin\" is the abode of the wondrous. The color unseen, the sound unheard, wondrous beyond the wondrous, suddenly arising. The form without form, the shape without substance, wondrous beyond the wondrous, suddenly taking shape. The primordial is manifest.\n\nVermilion and white transform, dark and yellow intermingle—constantly the primordial creates, and from the primordial Dao, life arises. I know not its arising; non-action is the root of the primordial and the yellow, the foundation of wondrous change. Sound and color arise from utmost wondrousness; things and forms take shape from utmost wondrousness—suddenly arising, suddenly forming, with no agent to cause it. Thus, vermilion and white transform, fire and metal overcome yet complete each other. Dark and yellow intermingle, water and earth coexist yet overcome each other. This is the constant creation of the primordial. The Dao of the primordial and the yellow is the root of all transformations and changes. The root gives birth to utmost wondrousness; wondrousness gives birth to the primordial, the primordial gives birth to the yellow, the yellow gives birth to the primordial—the wondrousness of the Three-in-One forms naturally.\n\nThe perfected one roots in utmost wondrousness; wondrousness gives birth to the primordial, the primordial gives birth to the yellow, the yellow again gives birth to the primordial—from non-being to being, from being to non-being, the wondrous, primordial, and yellow are three yet one, one yet three. Thus it is said: the wondrousness of the Three-in-One forms naturally. The primordial again primordial—within it lies the Dao of the primordial and the yellow. The primordial is the mother of the primordial; primordial sound, primordial form. My primordial is the mother—sound and form are attained. I call this the primordial primordial, yet I know not its primordial primordial, for the Dao is without superior.\n\nWithin the primordial there is color, thus it is called the primordial yellow. The mother of the primordial primordial gives birth to color and form; thus, color and form take the primordial as their mother. The primordial primordial takes me as its mother. Only I have no mother—this is called my not knowing its primordial primordial. The Dao is without superior.\n\n**Chapter Nine: Sixteen Words**\nThe wondrous conceals the primordial’s arising; the Dao conceals the wondrous being. Being and non-being give rise to each other; the spirit’s function is inexhaustible. The wondrous conceals, and the primordial begins to arise; the primordial contains utmost wondrousness. The Dao conceals, and things begin to possess the Dao within wondrous being. Within the wondrous midst, the primordial—yet the primordial is not manifest. Within being, the Dao—yet the Dao is not concealed. Thus, the primordial is also wondrous, being is also wondrous; being and non-being give rise to each other, and the spirit’s function is inexhaustible.\n\n*Commentary on the Primordial Dao and Virtue of Former Heaven, Scroll Two, Concluded*\n*Commentary on the Primordial Dao and Virtue of Former Heaven, Scroll Three*\n**Spirit Section: One Thousand Character Chapter**\n**First Chapter: Two Hundred Fifty-Two Words**\n\nWithin the Primordial resides spirit; spirit beyond spirit—how wondrous, I know not. Within spirit resides the Primordial; the Primordial beyond the Primordial—how primordial, I know not. Primordial and spirit harmonize, the Dao’s law is spontaneity—how spontaneous, I know not. The true Dao of Primordial and spirit both emerge from the wondrous.\n\nFive in one, one in five—thus within the Primordial is spirit, within spirit is the Primordial. When it is spirit, it knows not its own spirit. When it is the Primordial, it knows not its own Primordial. Primordial and spirit in harmony—yet it knows not this harmony. Though spontaneous, it knows not its spontaneity.\n\nLeft moves, right responds; right moves, left responds. Exhaling brings forth, inhaling draws in. Farther and farther, one and again one. Spirit employs spirit, one employs one—I know not its employment; I call it non-action. Not that I practice non-action, but I know not its employment. Response arises from stillness—such is the Dao of spirit.\n\nThe Dao is omnipresent, filling the six directions, embracing emptiness. Should one grasp its mechanism, there is nothing to which it does not respond. Like plucking the *gong* note and the *gong* vibrates, plucking the *jiao* note and the *jiao* arises—there is that which responds without knowing why. Thus, left moves and right responds, right moves and left responds. Exhaling brings forth, then returns to inhaling; inhaling draws in, then returns to exhaling. Is this near? Farther and farther. Is this many? One and again one—this is called spirit. Though complete in spirit, I know not its employment.\n\nIf spirit employs spirit, spirit beyond spirit employs further—then spirit knows not spirit. If one employs one, one beyond one employs further—then one knows not one. Like mercury rolling upon a plate, each motion perfects itself without external cause—thus I speak of non-action. In this way, though non-action is not without self, I know not its employment. Response arises from stillness—this is called the Dao of spirit.\n\nThe wondrous Primordial gives rise to spirit—I know not this arising. What I call supreme arising. Supreme wondrousness gives rise to the wondrous; the wondrous arises from the wondrous—such is the Dao of self-arising. I have said that the wondrous arising of the Primordial cannot be exhausted, nor can its beginning be found; I can only know its completion.\n\nFrom the wondrous Primordial descending to give rise to spirit—I know not the arising of spirit. For guarding the wondrous body, the Primordial-spirit arises of itself. I know not its arising—this is called supreme arising. Supreme arising: spirit arises from the wondrous, its arising inexhaustible. Being inexhaustible, its beginning cannot be found. Without finding its beginning, its end is not seen. Though its end is not seen, the supreme wondrous bestows and returns to stillness, reverting to wondrous being—yet what appears as an end is not truly an end. I can know its completion; knowing its completion, I may cause it to arise again.\n\nLeft moves, left responds—I am not in the left. Right moves, right responds—I am not in the right. Exhaling brings forth—I am not outside. Inhaling draws in—I am not inside. When I first respond, I have already lost myself. My response abides in the root of the great square—thus it is without direction. My transformation stands at the head of the great image—thus it is without form.\n\nLeft moves, left responds, yet I am not in the left; right moves, right responds, yet I am not in the right—then movement is not mine, nor is response. Exhaling brings forth, yet I know not my own exhalation. Inhaling draws in, yet I know not my own inhalation. For I am omnipresent. As the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* says: the true fire of emptiness pervades the Dharma realm. Like holding a burning mirror to seek fire from the sun—where the mirror is held, fire arises; if held throughout the world, fire arises throughout the world.\n\nPeople surely know there is left and right, exhalation and inhalation, yet they know not that it is omnipresent. It would seem there is no response, no movement, no exhalation, no inhalation. If even a trace of intention to respond arises, one is enslaved by things without respite—how then could one know the self as self? Only by abiding in the great square to respond to movement does its movement lack direction. Only by standing in formlessness to respond to change does its image lack form.\n\nWithout direction externally, without form internally—if not the most spirit-like under heaven, who could attain this? I constantly transform, yet I know not this transformation. I first unite within the Primordial, then threefold transform into the true. With me as one, one is not one. My employment and non-employment—I know not its movement or stillness. Spirit beyond spirit.\n\nSpirit arises from the wondrous Primordial like clouds emerging from mountains. In an instant, myriad transformations arise, yet the clouds know not themselves. My embodiment in the wondrous: first transformed in the Primordial, then in spirit, then in the true. Though threefold transformed, it is never not one. One is also three, three is also one. Employment and non-employment—all are transformation. Thus, movement is spirit, stillness is spirit—spirit beyond spirit.\n\n**Second Chapter: Thirty-Three Words**\nWondrous Primordial, spirit, one, seven, nine, three—yin and yang, heaven and earth, sun and moon, earth, wood, fire, metal, water. One, two, three; one, two, three; one, two, three—spirit abides in the Primordial of non-being.\n\nThe supremely wondrous touches upon images, the supremely spirit-like touches upon numbers. Thus, the Primordial Scroll speaks of the azure, white, vermilion, and yellow images; the Spirit Scroll speaks of the numbers one, seven, nine, three. Measured against the *River Chart*: one is below, nine above, three to the left, seven to the right. Verified by celestial numbers: the beginning azure obtains nine yang as wood; the cinnabar radiance obtains three yang as fire; the white numen obtains seven yang as metal; the dark above obtains one yang as water—all are the numbers one, seven, nine, three, distributed among the four directions.\n\nIn yin and yang, they are the numbers of qi; in heaven and earth, the numbers of movement; in sun and moon, the numbers of conjunction; in the Five Phases, the numbers of function. *Zhuangzi* says: \"The Dao and one make two, two and one make three. Beyond this, even the most skillful reckoner cannot know their number.\" From non-being to being, it reaches three—how much more from being to being?\n\nIf we follow *Zhuangzi*'s reasoning, then from the name of \"being wondrous\" (妙), the three are already complete—how much more from the wondrous to the primordial (元), from the primordial to the numinous (神), where even the most skillful reckoner cannot calculate. Thus, from one to two, from two to three, and three again and again, reaching an incalculable multitude. Though the numinous disperses, its thousands and myriads enter into number yet transcend number. Hence it is said: the primordial of non-being (无无之元) is called \"one,\" yet even one cannot be attained—how much less three?\n\n**Chapter Three** (102 words)\nHeaven and earth unite through the primordial; yin and yang conjoin through the primordial; sun and moon embrace through the primordial. The three primordials merge into non-being, and the ten thousand images are without existence—this is called the *primordial root* (元根). The primordial root arises from non-being: heaven and earth do not unite without the primordial; yin and yang do not conjoin without the primordial; sun and moon do not shine without the primordial. \"Embrace\" means containing the primordial and manifesting luminosity. My primordial begins at the inception, as the numen’s spirit (神之灵). The numen arises from emptiness and non-being (虚无), empty yet inexhaustible. I call it the *Great Primordial’s Numen* (太元之神): at the inception, who can empty it? From non-being the numen is born—inception, numen, inception, wondrous. When my one first arises, the wondrous is empty emptiness (妙无虚虚). The numen is born within the wondrous non-being of the primordial inception, empty yet inexhaustible, moving yet ever emerging—all is its natural, uncontrived state. Thus, the Great Primordial’s Numen: at the inception, who can empty it? To speak of emptiness is not to claim it can be fabricated. It arises from utmost non-being, and the utmost numinous is only the inception’s numen, united with the inception’s wondrousness, merging into supreme function. Hence it is said: \"When my one first arises, though the numen is born, the wondrous is empty emptiness.\" *Primordial emptiness* (元虚) is the true emptiness of the Great Primordial. *Great One* (太一), following its primordial inception, the Great One’s being and non-being, the numen unites with the Great Void (太虚). The Great Void is the primordial’s primordial numen (元元之神), entering and exiting the wondrous primordial (妙元). The primordial of primordial emptiness is true emptiness. Though the Great One also follows the primordial inception, the Great One’s wondrous being and wondrous non-being must unite with the emptiness of primordial emptiness to attain perfection. Thus, the Great Void is the primordial’s primordial numen: when the numen is whole, there is exit and entry. Though there is exit and entry, its traces do not adhere—hence it is called *wondrous primordial*.\n\n**Chapter Four** (8 words)\nHeaven and earth give birth to the numen; the numen gives birth to heaven and earth.\n\n**Chapter Five** (144 words)\nThe numen is the primordial one (元一) of primordial emptiness and primordial fullness. The one conceals primordial emptiness, and the numen becomes evanescent (恍惚). If the one-numen does not cease, the evanescent cannot grasp the numen. The true arises from the evanescent, blending indistinguishably into the obscure (杳冥). My one is not seen; my numen is not heard—the numen merges with primordial emptiness. Beginning as emptiness, it gradually becomes full. The numen in emptiness does not increase; the numen in fullness does not decrease. Hence it is said: the numen is the primordial one. This one, concealed in primordial emptiness, is the wondrousness of the evanescent. If the numen does not congeal, then the evanescent cannot grasp the numen. The true inception congeals within the Great Void, evanescent and indistinct, blending into the obscure. Though there is one, things do not see it; though there is numen, things do not hear it—yet my one never ceases to be one, my numen never ceases to be numen. Hence it is said: the numen merges with primordial emptiness. This \"merging\" is what the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* calls \"seeing yet transcending seeing, where seeing cannot reach.\" The inception’s utmost Dao, the utmost Dao’s empty numen, is the stabilization of the Great One’s inception. Uniting numen and wondrousness, primordial inception and wondrous inception, wondrous inception and primordial inception—my primordial numen’s primordial cannot be grasped; the numen cannot be unified. The Dao of transformation, the function of numinous clarity, establishes the foundation and sets the omen, engendering and transforming wondrously. The utmost Dao gathers the foundation of emptiness and the numen; when stabilized at the inception of stabilization and extremity, the myriad numina naturally assemble. Assembling yet unaware of assembling, transforming the one into the myriad, uniting wondrousness and numen—this wondrousness is natural, all my primordial inception. The function of wondrous inception seeks the numen’s primordial, yet the primordial cannot be grasped. If there were grasping and primordial, the numen would be a thing—no longer the numen. Precisely because there is no grasping, the numen cannot be unified. Its ten thousand transformations are inexhaustible in function. With the wondrous, it establishes the foundation and sets the omen: the wondrous gives birth to the numen, and the numen numinously begets one another. Hence it is said: engendering and transforming wondrously. At first, when my one transforms into three, it unites with the numen-primordial (神元). The inception’s numen numinously transforms and wondrously responds; wondrous response transforms and changes—the numen’s natural state. Things do not know the numen; naturally, the numen is numinous. Wondrousness unites with the primordial; the primordial unites with the numen—this is called \"one transforming into three,\" uniting with the numen-primordial. This is my inception’s central numen: the numen transforms itself, transforming to respond to things, wondrously responding and wondrously transforming—the numen’s natural state, the natural’s numen, numinous and numinous. The *Book of Changes* says: \"Without thought, without action, still and unmoving, yet when stimulated, it penetrates all things under heaven. If not the utmost numen under heaven, who could achieve this?\" If inwardly there is no thought, the heart does not know the heart; if outwardly there is no action, the body does not know the body. Inwardly not seeing the heart, outwardly not seeing the body—then it is still and unmoving. Stillness responds and penetrates, then without the heart knowing, without the body acting, without thought yet nothing unknown, without action yet nothing undone—this is called penetrating all things under heaven. \"Hence\" refers to traces. And the traces of all under heaven cannot escape. This is what is meant by wondrous transformation and wondrous response. If not the utmost numen under heaven, who could achieve this?\n\n**Chapter Six** (134 words)\nOne numen wondrous, one numen primordial; wondrous numen, primordial numen; moving numen, still numen; exiting numen, entering numen; having numen, lacking numen; yin numen, yang numen; seeing numen, hearing numen; evanescent numen, indistinct numen; left numen, right numen; one numen, myriad numina—numinous, numinous! The numen does not know the numen.\n\nThe numen unites with the wondrous, the numen unites with the primordial; the primordial is also numen, the wondrous is also numen. Thus, in movement and stillness, exit and entry, presence and absence, yin and yang, seeing and hearing, evanescence and indistinctness, left and right, the one and the myriad—none do not arise from the numen’s transformations. Numinous, numinous! The numen does not know its own numinosity.\n\nOur primordial numen follows the Dao of the numen, and only then is the numen known. The numen is wondrous in a single thing, and even ghosts and spirits cannot grasp its numinosity. The Dao is graded by the measure of what is realized: the higher can encompass the lower, but the lower cannot know the higher. Only when one is born of this can one know what is ours.\n\nThus, only through the numen can the numen be known, as in the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra*’s eighteen heavens of the form realm, among which are the five heavens of no-return. Those in the four dhyānas of the form realm merely hear with reverence but cannot perceive. Therefore, among heavenly and human beings, only the six heavens of the desire realm and the thirteen heavens of the form realm’s four dhyānas can see one another. Yet even within the form realm, the five heavens of no-return cannot see each other, let alone those of the formless realm. Above the formless realm, Buddhism does not call them heavens. Even in the formless realm, body and mind are extinguished in the samādhi of cessation, seeing no karma before them, let alone those above. This is what Daoism calls \"non-action\" and Buddhism calls \"Buddha.\"\n\nThe numen’s wondrousness over the myriad things enables it to unite above with the Great Beginning and below with the multitude of things. United with the Great Beginning, it does not know the Great Beginning’s nothingness; united with the multitude of things, it does not know the multitude’s existence. Only when it emerges from the wondrous and descends to unite with things can the numen know itself—how could ghosts and spirits know it? Thus it is said: the numen is wondrous in a single thing, and ghosts and spirits cannot grasp its numinosity.\n\nOur primordial numen of the primordial heavens swallows the red, internalizes the yellow, inhales the blue-green, and wears the white, gathering the primordial in our Primordial Palace as the Great One, the numinous mother. The primordial heavens do not seek the five colors, yet the five colors arise naturally, like the eyes, ears, nose, and tongue arising from form, without anyone making them known. Thus, the primordial is gathered in the Primordial Palace as the Great One, the numinous mother. The primordial is the profound, the profound is the void, and the void is the mother.\n\nWithin the profound, swallowing the red, internalizing the yellow, inhaling the blue-green, and wearing the white—these are the true colors of the five phases. Yet it is not that we intentionally swallow, internalize, inhale, or wear them; these four are inherent within the Great One. When the mechanism moves, colors respond; when the numen moves, heaven follows—what Buddhism calls \"the nature-color is true emptiness, the nature-emptiness is true color.\" If you are empty and luminous, then emptiness manifests; earth, water, fire, and wind each illuminate and each manifest. If all illuminate together, then all manifest together. Swallowing and internalizing, inhaling and wearing—these are also the meaning of illumination.\n\nOur primordial oneness moves seven times and stabilizes nine times, beginning numinously and ending numinously, returning to the primordial primordial. Numbers begin at one, are completed at three, centered at five, transformed at seven, and exhausted at nine—thus the generating numbers belong to heaven. From one to five, the yang number three is obtained. The completing numbers belong to earth. From six to ten, the yin number two is obtained. This is the meaning of the *Yijing*’s \"three heavens and two earths.\" Thus, five is the center; the central five is unused, and ten is the extreme, which returns to one. Excluding five and ten, from one to four are the great numbers of things’ generation, and from six to nine are the great numbers of things’ completion.\n\nFrom one comes two, and there is above and below; above and below are established, and the center stands. With above, center, and below, there is three. With three, there is left, right, front, and back—thus four. Three is yang, so humans and heavens obtain it and stand firm. Four is yin, so the beings beside them obtain it and lie horizontally.\n\nIn the beginning of primordial numbers, one is heaven, two is earth. Heaven’s one becomes three, and earth’s two becomes four. Heaven’s numbers are recorded by eons, earth’s numbers by realms. Thus, eons are three, realms are four. The *Śūraṅgama Sūtra*’s \"three fours, four threes\" revolve to make twelve—the great number of heaven and earth. The formation of worlds, the completion of lands, the birth of all things, down to the years, days, months, and stars—all twelve transformations return to one, cycling back. This is the great number of things’ generation.\n\nThe \"movement at seven\" refers to governance by the seven luminaries, the stars by the seven regulators, and the years by the seven completions. The \"seven movements\" are the sun, moon, and five planets as the weft. The \"seven regulators\" are the four times seven, twenty-eight constellations as the warp. A month has dark and new moons, crescents and full moons—four times seven, twenty-eight days and a fraction—when the sun and moon conjoin. A year has twelve conjuctions, and dark, new, crescent, and full moons total forty-eight and a fraction—this is the seven-times-seven number.\n\nThe \"exhaustion at nine\" refers to heaven’s nine heavens, earth’s nine regions, ranks’ nine grades, and humans’ nine classes. A day has twelve two-hour periods, of which seven are fully bright, and sometimes bright makes nine. From *mao* to *you* is fully bright; *yin* and *xu* are sometimes bright. Thus, seven movements and nine stabilizations reach twelve and are exhausted—this is the great number of things’ completion. Therefore, one, three, and five are yang within yang; seven and nine are yin within yang. Those who attain the Dao can sever the yin of seven and return to yang, sever the yin of nine and return to one—thus it is called \"seven returns, nine reversions.\" The meaning is taken from this, so it is said: beginning numinously and ending numinously, returning to the primordial primordial.\n\nWho knows our primordial beginning? Knowing the primordial beginning’s non-numinosity, there is nothing that is not numinous. Not knowing the primordial beginning’s numinosity—this is the numen’s wondrousness, emerging from presence and entering absence, transforming beyond measure.\n\nIf one then takes transformation and change to be the numinous, this is incorrect. The numinous arises from the wondrous, which in turn emerges from the primordial authenticity of the primordial beginning. When the heart’s intentions are inwardly severed and consciousness returns to spontaneity, the numinous is fundamentally non-numinous. Only by being non-numinous does the numinous become all-pervasive.\n\n**Chapter Seven (150 words)**\nThe numinous is non-numinous; the non-numinous is numinous. One numen contains the primordial; ten thousand numina return to the one. The numen, though non-numinous, divides into numina; the numen, though non-numinous, is numinous. If the heart harbors thought, the numen binds to that thought and halts—how then can the one become the ten thousand? The numina, numinous in their own right, know nothing of one another.\n\nOnly when heart-intention and consciousness are inwardly severed and emotions dissolved do the ten thousand numina intermingle and arise. When they contain the primordial and return of themselves, the ten thousand numina revert to the one. As they arise, they arise spontaneously; as they return, they return spontaneously—this is the Dao of the non-numinous.\n\nI was transformed by the primordial beginning yet know it not. The numinous begins with the primordial; the primordial is the mother of the numinous. What then is the primordial of the primordial, the origin of origins? The numen of the primordial, the primordial of the numen—mutually without form, mutually with presence, the primordial beginning knows it not. I am born of the Dao of spontaneity.\n\nThe numinous arises from the wondrous, without end or beginning. It congeals spontaneously; it transforms spontaneously. Transformation becomes the numinous; congealment becomes the wondrous. Wondrous awareness is without form; transformed, it becomes the numen. The numen’s form is elusive; wondrous awareness is not nothingness, nor is the numen’s form presence. Thus, form is both presence and absence—the primordial beginning knows it not.\n\nThe numen moves, the numen is still; one change, one transformation. The numen sees, the numen hears—none grasp its traces. The numina are not obscured; thus I first attain it. I am without movement or stillness, yet the numen moves and is still; I am without change or transformation, yet the numen changes and transforms; I am without seeing or hearing, yet the numen sees and hears—this is what is meant by \"the numina are not obscured, none grasp their traces.\" Only the primordial beginning attains it.\n\nAbiding in the elusive, the obscure, the profound and dark, the true one is spontaneous, dwelling in the deep and wondrous abode. The numen and the primordial give birth to one another; the numen gives birth to the numen. Yet the numen giving birth to the numen is not as good as having no numen. One giving birth to one is not as good as empty oneness. Spontaneously attaining the one.\n\nKnow the numen and guard the numen—the numen’s beginning is non-numinous. Know the one and guard the one—the one’s beginning is non-one. Being non-numinous, the numen becomes unfathomable. Being non-one, the ten thousand transformations return to the one. Thus, in the elusive, the obscure, the profound and dark, the true one is spontaneous, dwelling in the deep abode—this is the root of the numen. Therefore, the numina are not as good as having no numen; one-on-one is not as good as empty oneness.\n\nThe true primordial guards the true primordial in non-use—thus the numen attains longevity. The primordial gives birth to the primordial of the primordial; the numen creates transformation in the empty valley. I dwell in the wondrousness of the empty valley. Those who attain the Dao guard the true primordial in non-use—thus the numen attains longevity.\n\nThe reason people cannot attain longevity is that the six inner roots scatter into external use, chasing forms and sounds without return. If one can know the origin of the six senses’ dissipation, guard the true and discard the false, and return to the primordial of themselves, then the six roots are without use, the roots and dust dissolve inwardly, the spirit-light shines brightly, and the numen is born from nothingness—this is what is meant by \"creating transformation in the empty valley,\" the abode of longevity.\n\n**Chapter Eight (180 words)**\nThe numen’s wondrousness, the numen’s primordiality—presence and absence are spontaneous; I know not their use. The wondrous primordial is the non-numen of spontaneity; the numen is the wondrousness of spontaneity. The wondrous primordial becomes the numen—from nothingness, presence arises. The numen becomes the wondrous primordial—from presence, nothingness arises. Both arise from spontaneity; I know not their use.\n\nUsing the numen’s obscurity, stabilizing the numen’s clarity—numinous clarity, numinous obscurity, the numen intermingles with the primordial yellow. The primordial yellow intermingles with the numen; I know not its presence. Obscurity is the root of clarity; the wondrous is the root of the numen. Obscurity unites with the wondrous; clarity responds to change—the numen intermingles with the primordial yellow.\n\nThe primordial yellow is heaven and earth. The numen intermingles with heaven and earth; heaven and earth intermingle with the numen—those who engage with presence are complete. Engaging with presence, I know not its presence.\n\nThe non-numinous is the child of the primordial; the non-primordial is the mother of the numen. The mother of the numen does not give birth; the wondrous primordial unites with the numen. Know the mother and guard the child—the Dao unites with spontaneity.\n\nThe numen is the child of the primordial; the primordial is the mother of the numen. The reason the numen is non-numinous is that it emerges from the primordial. The reason the primordial is non-primordial is that it can give birth to the numen. Know the mother of the primordial and guard the child of the numen—the Dao unites with spontaneity.\n\nThe primordial of the primordial gives birth to blackness; the numen of the numen gives birth to whiteness. Know whiteness and guard blackness—numinous clarity arises of itself. The extremity of the primordial of the primordial is the profound, which is blackness. The extremity of the numen is the manifest, which is whiteness. Know whiteness and guard blackness—its whiteness is inexhaustible. Know the numen and guard the numen—its numen is unfathomable.\n\nThe numen comes without coming; the primordial beginning is great simplicity. Within the primordial is great simplicity—all vessels are without presence; the numen and the primordial are wondrous vessels. Taking the great simplicity within the primordial as a vessel, not knowing the vessel’s encounter with the numen or the numen’s encounter with the vessel—this is called \"the numen without coming,\" the vessel beyond vessels. Thus, all vessels are without presence.\n\n**Chapter Nine (69 words)**\nThe numen dwells in the wondrous valley, giving birth to the empty chamber. The empty and wondrous valley is my primordial beginning’s wondrous abode. The valley is empty and receptive; the wondrous is empty and responsive. Thus, the valley contains the ten thousand images; the wondrous contains the ten thousand numina. Within the empty chamber, utmost whiteness arises of itself, pure and unadulterated—thus it is called \"the one.\"\n\nThe wondrousness of the primordial beginning is like the valley, like the chamber—receptive to all. The numen is born within the primordial; movement only increases its presence. The beginning of the primordial one is the numen’s dwelling. Embrace it, guard it, carry it, convey it. Steal it and steal it again; steal and steal again—spirits and things come and go. The wondrous valley is profoundly empty—this is called the true thief.\n\nThe numen dwells within the primordial. Embrace it, guard it, carry it, convey it. If it is not mine, to possess what is not one’s own is called stealing.\n\nThose who study the Dao in relation to the numen—if they employ what is not theirs, stealing and stealing again, stealing once more—are like spirits and things coming and going, like the valley’s profound emptiness. The more they use it, the more it abounds: this is called the true thief. The *Yijing* says: \"Did the author of the *Changes* know about stealing?\" The *Changes* speaks of inexhaustible generation; the more it is used, the more it increases—like stealing another’s possessions, reaping without sowing, naturally responsive in application. This is of the same meaning.\n\nThe numen of the primordial is numinous and martial; the thief cannot be seen. The primordial numen is wondrously one, vast and self-content. The *Yijing* says: \"The sage washes the heart and retreats to conceal it in secrecy.\" Without the ancient’s keen hearing, clear sight, and divine wisdom—numinous and martial yet not destructive—who could attain this? The numen is never without display of martial power, never without destruction of being. Keen hearing, clear sight, and divine wisdom enable the washing of the heart, the retreat to conceal being. The numinous and martial are not employed, yet their function is achieved in non-destruction. Without the numen concealing the primordial and the primordial concealing the numen, this cannot be attained. If one reaches its ultimate, then the primordial numen is wondrously one, vast and self-content.\n\n*Commentary on the Primordial Dao and Virtue of the Precelestial Classic, Scroll Three* concludes.\n*Commentary on the Primordial Dao and Virtue of the Precelestial Classic, Scroll Four*\n*The True Chapters of a Thousand Words*\n*Chapter One: Forty-Four Sayings*\n\nTrue, true, true—where the numen is, there is no lack of efficacy; where efficacy is, there is the numen. Efficacy is the function of the numen, and in the wondrousness of the true-true, efficacy is also the numen. Thus, the refined is wondrous, and the coarse is wondrous. The Dao of the Nine Returns, the profound truth of the boundless, is non-action and non-creation, where truth is complete and the numen is withdrawn. Attaining oneness is truth; when the count reaches nine and returns, ten is but one. If there be hundreds, thousands, or tens of thousands, they are but extensions of ten. From one to nine, all things are encompassed; when nine returns to ten, it is the meaning of reverting to the root. Withdrawing the numen to preserve truth whole, in non-action and non-creation, is called the True Person. The vessel of absolute constancy is the great simplicity of the primordial true. True, true, true—true, true, true—true, true, true.\n\nThe Dao has great and small, but truth is the mother of the Dao. The multitude enters truth through the Dao, and after truth, the numen. The perfected person enters truth through the numen, withdrawing the numen to return to the root. Thus it is said: the vessel of absolute constancy is the great simplicity of the primordial true. The reiteration of *true, true, true* signifies the absence of admixture.\n\n*Chapter Two: One Hundred and Eleven Sayings*\n\nBoundless and obscure, utmost refinement and truth—the numen is one and undivided, constant in transformation and change. The boundless and obscure are not nothingness; refined truth arises from the boundless and obscure. Thus, the boundless and obscure are the root of refined truth. Embracing refinement and guarding the numen, undivided and undispersed, transformation and change emerge therefrom. People often seek transformation and change in transformation and change, yet do not know that natural transformation and change are inevitable. For the boundless and obscure are the root of refined truth, and oneness is the root of transformation and change. Seeking refined truth will not yield refined truth; seeking transformation and change will not yield transformation and change. If the numen is undivided, then transformation and change are inevitable, and there is no need for words—this is why the sage values non-action.\n\nThe wondrous existence of the primordial true, the natural oneness of truth—deep-rooted and firmly established. Wondrous existence is all-encompassing; within the primordial true, heaven and earth are positioned, and the myriad things are nurtured. People see it as such yet do not know it is the natural oneness of truth, deeply rooted and firmly established, rooted in wondrous non-being. Only because it is rooted in wondrous non-being does wondrous existence unfold like roots bearing branches, like flowers bearing fruit—all according to natural principle.\n\nOne and again one, faith and again faith—faith upon faith, unbroken, outlasting heaven and earth. One is all-encompassing oneness. Faith is all-encompassing trust. The flaw of those who study the Dao lies in their inability to be one and their inability to trust. Thus, in action, they are one person; in stillness, another. In speech, they are one person; in silence, another. Such is not oneness. They trust in true principles but not in the untruth of the principle-less. They trust in purity but not in the purity of the object-less. They trust in a single self but do not know that within the six directions, there is nowhere that is not the self. They trust in a single mind but do not know that in things great and small, there is nothing that is not the mind. Such is not trust. Without oneness, one cannot be forced into oneness; without trust, one cannot be forced into trust. To ensure unwavering trust and oneness, one must be one again and again, trust again and again. Without true insight, one cannot achieve such unbroken trust. Though heaven and earth may end, this insight shall never be exhausted.\n\nThe wondrous oneness of the true Dao, the natural true Dao—each truth is true in its own way, and a single truth bends to preserve the whole. Knowing the natural truth, in all application, there is nothing that is not so of itself. The scholar of the Dao applies all things as emptiness; when encountering matters, they respond without attachment; when unoccupied, they remain empty without desolation. Thus, in action, truth; in stillness, truth; in directness, truth; in bending, truth. In action, stillness is not lost; in bending, directness is not lost. Thus it is said: truth bends to preserve the whole.\n\nOur Primordial True One, the Dao has attained its ultimate in oneness. Confucius said to Zigong: \"Ci, do you think I am one who learns much and retains it?\" Zigong replied: \"Is it not so?\" Confucius said: \"It is not. I unify it with one.\" Moreover, learning much and retaining it is a flaw of learning. The flaw of retention lies in not knowing oneness. If one knows oneness, then benevolence and righteousness do not conflict, loyalty and filial piety do not oppose, firmness and softness do not contradict, bending and straightness do not harm, action and stillness do not disorder, speech and silence do not oppose. Thus, the Dao is one Dao, and things are one thing. Things do not differ from the Dao; the Dao does not differ from things. The refined is also coarse, and the coarse is also refined. Thus it is said: penetrating oneness, all matters are complete.\n\nAll truths rest, yet I do not know their rest—primordial true wondrous oneness. In action, nothing is not true; thus, in rest, nothing is not true. In action, there is no action in truth; in rest, there is no rest. Thus it is said: \"I do not know its rest\"—this is called the primordial true wondrous oneness.\n\nOur Primordial True One is established at the primordial head; the Dao of true oneness—there is nothing in which I am not one. Our primordial true ultimate Dao—all truths return to my oneness, and the true Dao is truly constant.\n\nThe *Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra* records the eternalist debate of the external paths: some say all things are originally eternal, eternally unchanging; others say things are originally non-eternal, yet conceive them as eternal through thought and calculation. If things are originally non-eternal but conceived as eternal through thought and calculation, then eternity is not real. Refuting this, Laozi said: \"Knowing constancy is called illumination\"—this is the true Dao. The true constancy of constancy is oneness, truth, wondrousness, the primordial, the numen, and the Dao. Thus it is said: \"There is nothing in which I am not one; all truths return to my oneness.\" Not only this—principle is in affairs, things are the self, taking is in having, receiving is in love. There is nothing that is not one, nothing that is not empty—this is called true constancy and ultimate oneness.\n\n*Chapter Three: Fifty-Two Sayings*\n\nWondrous oneness, primordial oneness, numinous oneness—these three onenesses are the same. The true wondrous oneness is undispersed; in non-action, transformation and change arise from the primordial true naturalness. Wondrousness is not wondrous, the primordial is not primordial, the numen is not the numen—why? Because they are one in the true.\n\nThus, the true oneness remains undispersed, and so its transformations are unfathomable—yet still natural. Perceive oneness, preserve oneness, embrace oneness, and enter my primordial oneness.\n\nFirst, one must perceive oneness in the nothing-that-is-not-one; only then can one preserve oneness. Only by preserving oneness in the nothing-that-is-not-one can one embrace oneness. If one cannot perceive, one cannot preserve; if one cannot preserve, one cannot embrace; if one cannot embrace, one cannot enter.\n\nTherefore, perception of oneness comes first. If, in things, one fails to perceive oneness, then short and long harm each other, self and other clash—how then could one preserve it without loss? My Most High, the Primordial Beginning, the Wondrously Fixed—true oneness, the Great Oneness—these are the exalted names of the Primordial Beginning, and those who attain them are true.\n\nThe Primordial Beginning and the Wondrously Fixed are what the Śākya school calls *nirvāṇa*. The *Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra* states that *nirvāṇa* and emptiness are not distinct in meaning—this is precisely what is meant by true oneness and the Great Oneness.\n\n*Chapter Four: One Hundred Forty-Two Sayings*\n\nThe one truth returns to the primordial; the ten thousand transformations revert to oneness. Guarding the true oneness, one enters my numinous heaven. There is nothing that is not one; oneness cannot be fixed as one. The truth of the Primordial Beginning, the Dao’s oneness unchanging, the numen’s oneness untransforming—returning to the wondrous primordial, the primordial’s one Dao.\n\nThe true returns to the primordial; the ten thousand revert to one. Guarding the true and preserving oneness—this is called numinous heaven. The wondrousness of numinous heaven: there is nothing that is not one.\n\nIn the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra*, the Buddha tells Mañjuśrī: \"The Tathāgata abides in *samādhi*, seeing both the seen and the conditions of seeing, along with the imagined forms, like flowers in empty space—fundamentally nonexistent. This seeing and its conditions are originally the bodhisattva’s wondrously pure luminous essence, entrusted to the midst of existence. Is this so or not? You, Mañjuśrī, are yet another Mañjuśrī. Since you recognize the true within it, there are in reality no dualities of right and wrong. Yet the eye sees, the roots connect to dust and form, and from within the dust and form, knowing arises in *samādhi*. Observe these dust-conditions as like flowers in space—what existence do they truly have? One cannot call them real. Though they are flowers in space, the knowing of these flowers is originally bodhi—one cannot call it unreal.\"\n\nNow, using the Buddha’s words to illuminate and compare: the eye sees form, and the ten thousand things differ. From this, who is the one origin? Their root source is my primordial. If the wondrous were not primordial, the wondrous dust would have nothing to depend upon. Thus, who is not one? Before recognizing Mañjuśrī’s words as Mañjuśrī’s, there is right and wrong. Once Mañjuśrī is recognized, the dualities of right and wrong naturally do not arise. One and not-one are likewise. Because one does not know oneness, there is right and wrong, discrimination and inquiry. Once the true one is seen, these distinctions vanish of themselves. One and not-one—thus it is said: there is nothing that is not one.\n\nAs for \"oneness cannot be fixed as one,\" this means oneness cannot be defined. If one fixes oneness as a single thing, then it is one and unchanging—hence oneness cannot be fixed as one. If the Dao is said to be unchanging, then it is not the Dao; if the numen is said to be untransforming, then it is not the numen. Only when oneness returns to the wondrous primordial—though the ten thousand differ, oneness does not see oneness—is this called the Dao of primordial oneness.\n\nMy Primordial Beginning is the utmost true and boundless. The highest truth of the primordial Dao gives rise to my Way of no-spirit. The utmost of the true, the highest of the Dao—no-spirit, no-bound—this is called the Primordial Beginning. The essence of the true-true relies on the primordial yellow; the number of the no-no suddenly becomes one, and I perceive it. The true-true has no essence, yet it forms an essence by relying on heaven and earth; the no-no has no number, yet it gains number by borrowing from the one. With essence, there are things; with number, there is growth. In things, one knows the true; in growth, one knows oneness—only those with the Dao can do this.\n\nWho can guard my true oneness, seeing the true in the wondrous true, knowing oneness in oneness, oneness in solitude, oneness in subtlety? Guarding it as the exalted one, from the beginningless to the boundless. Only by seeing the true can one see the true; only by knowing oneness can one know oneness. Only then can one see what others cannot see, know what others cannot know. In guarding it, one attains utmost solitude and subtlety. In employing it, one attains utmost universality and vastness. In guarding it, one nears the beginningless. In employing it, one reaches the boundless.\n\nTrue constancy is non-action; wondrous oneness is numberless. Non-action and numberless—this is the Primordial Beginning’s true oneness. Action involves boundaries; number involves things. True constancy is the wondrous boundary, the boundaryless boundary; true oneness is the wondrous number, the numberless number—thus it is called the Primordial Beginning’s true oneness. The spiritless abides in the multitude of beginnings, the Dao complete; numberless, truly complete, non-action—this is truly attaining the true.\n\nIf one does not recognize the true, then a speck of dust can obscure the heavens, a mustard seed can overturn the earth. If one sees the true, then even amid affairs and things, one remains numberless, actionless. This is because the multitude lacks the true, and so what they see is never true. The sage is true of himself, and so what he encounters is never not true—this is called truly attaining the true.\n\n*Chapter Five: Fifteen Sayings*\n\nGuard the true with the true, and no falsity arises. Sincerity in sincerity—this is attaining the true Dao. Guarding the true with the true, there is no falsity that is not true. Seeking the true with the false, there is no truth that is not false.\n\nThe *Doctrine of the Mean* says: \"Sincerity is the Dao of Heaven; pursuing sincerity is the Dao of man.\" What is called Heaven is sincerity arising from within, as if naturally, without any who are insincere. If one has intentions regarding sincerity, then it is pursuing sincerity. Pursuit involves deviation; pursuit involves falsity. The decline of the human Dao begins here.\n\nSincerity in sincerity—no thought, only trust. At the utmost of trust, sincerity arises naturally. This is the utmost of the true Dao.\n\n*Chapter Six: One Hundred Fifteen Sayings*\n\nThe numen gives rise to the true; the true gives rise to the numen. When the numen unites with the true, transformations are fixed and unchanging.\n\nThe numen enters the true; attaining oneness, one then enters the numinous and reaches the utmost true. I return to the boundless.\n\nWhen the true and the numen unite, though there is change and transformation, there is no change and no transformation—all rooted in the natural. The numen enters the true numinously; its transformations are unseen. Thus, attaining oneness, one obtains oneness. Though there be a thousand changes and ten thousand transformations, all emerge from non-being. This is called \"I return to the boundless.\"\n\nIn the Great Beginning, the true One had not yet arisen. The numbers of the indistinct and vague existed at the tip of a hair’s end. The Primal Beginning grasped its wondrous number, guarded the One without change, stabilized the unchanging origin, and held fast to the numen without parting. With the true guarding the numen, the numen is not seen to be guarded.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* says: \"Trace beginnings to their end, and thus know the explanations of life and death.\" Before I was born, whence did I come? When my end arrives, whither shall I go? If one knows whence one comes, one may know whither one departs.\n\nAt the beginning of the Great One, in the unborn origin, the numbers of the indistinct and vague existed at the tip of a hair’s end. At that time, the One was whole and undivided. The Primal Beginning grasped its wondrous number—wondrous number being the One. The Primal Beginning could guard the One without change, stabilize the unchanging origin, and thus stand alone before heaven and earth.\n\nHumans wander in life and death because they cannot preserve the One within non-being, cannot maintain the One of the Great Beginning. Instead, they divide it into six functions, gather dust to form roots, and thus all forms and images lack a fixed origin. Unable to stabilize roots and bind form, joy and anger alter their nature, sorrow and delight stir their emotions. Abandoning the root to pursue the branch, they depart from the Primal Beginning.\n\nThe perfected one is not thus. Knowing that dust is illusory, dust cannot cling. Since dust does not cling, the six do not divide the One. The One is whole within non-being, inwardly radiant and luminous. Thus, there is the function of non-being, the Dao of stabilizing the beginning. Naturally, the numen does not part from the One, and the One does not part from the numen. With the true guarding the numen, the numen is not seen to be guarded. Why? Because the root does not part; thus, the root naturally does not part, and guarding is without use.\n\nI do not act as the function of non-being, nor dwell in the forms of being. The wondrous valley contains the true; the wondrous true contains the empty. The wondrous Primal One of the true One—I attain the true of myself.\n\nKnowing that the numen arises from the true is to be the function of non-being. Knowing that the true can give rise to the numen is to generate the forms of being. Though I act as the function of non-being, and though I take form in being, all stems from knowing the beginning.\n\nThus, the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* says: \"When knowledge establishes knowledge, it is the root of ignorance. When knowledge is without seeing, this is nirvana—unblemished, truly pure.\" Only in the function of non-function, functioning yet not functioning; in the forms of being, forming yet not forming. Knowledge does not arise; knowledge is without seeing. This is the wondrous valley containing the true, the wondrous true containing the empty. The true true attains itself—I know not its attainment.\n\nAttaining the One is no attainment, yet true attainment. The true Primal is wondrous; the true One is without being.\n\nIn learning the Dao, if there is the slightest attainment, it is dust and toil. Thus, the *Scripture of Purity* says: \"Though called attaining the Dao, in reality there is nothing attained.\" The Buddhist scriptures say: \"In the Dharma, there is truly nothing attained.\" If one speaks of attainment, what is attained can be lost. What can be attained and lost is not true seeing. If one attains the One yet truly has no attainment, the One cannot be parted. I am the One; the One is I. This is called true attainment—the true One is without being.\n\n*Chapter Seven: One Hundred Fifty-Two Sayings*\n\nRadiant, the true Primal; profound, the wondrous One. Vast and empty, the Primal Valley—dimly, a jade chamber arises. I now embrace the Primal Simplicity, contain the Yellow Ultimate, stabilize the cinnabar uncarved block—without color, without sound. Silent, the true body becomes one with me.\n\nThe true Primal, the wondrous One—radiant in its simplicity, profound in its depth. Like a valley’s emptiness, like a chamber’s warmth. Embracing the Primal Simplicity is the color of heaven; containing the Yellow Ultimate is the image of earth. Embracing the Primal and containing the Yellow encompasses heaven and earth, forming the cinnabar uncarved block.\n\nThe so-called cinnabar uncarved block is without color, without sound—silent, the true body. If one takes the having of the uncarved as the uncarved, it is the division of Primal Yellow, not its wholeness. Embracing the Primal and containing the Yellow, then heaven and earth are undivided. From before the beginning of heaven and earth, the true body is one with me.\n\nThis true body was originally one with me. Because I was not one, I became different from the One, and thus lost the Primal Constant. The Dao of the Primal Constant is the One attaining itself. I, in the Primal Beginning, attained the Dao of the true One. The great image of Primal Yellow, the wondrous One—pure and clear. From emptiness, the One transforms. The true Primal does not change; the Dao cannot be attained.\n\nThe great image of Primal Yellow had no image at the beginning. Only the wondrous One—pure and clear. From emptiness, the One transforms, and the great Dao arises. The true Primal does not change—wondrously wondrous, without form; Primal Primal, without body; numinous numinous, without number; true true, without change—thus, the Dao cannot be attained.\n\nThe great Dao conceals the true; the true Primal is without action. The numen and the true are fixed as one, arising and departing without going. The true name endures—this is called trust.\n\nThe flowing true, the distant true—return to the One. The true disperses into the Dao; the Dao conceals the utmost true. The Dao is in the world—great as the wondrous Primal, small as benevolence and righteousness—thus, the Dao has great and small. Those who attain the Dao live; those who lose the Dao die—thus, the Dao has attainment and loss. When humans exist, the Dao flourishes; when humans perish, the Dao decays—thus, the Dao has flourishing and decay.\n\nYet the true One, the wondrous Primal—without action, without cessation; without going, without coming. Abiding in stillness, it eternally remains. Arising and departing without going—thus, the true is the constant Dao. The true name endures. The true descends from the Dao, flowing without losing trust, distant without losing the beginning. The Dao disperses into things, departing far from the root. Yet the true has never lost the One, never parted from it. If one can return to the One and revert to the true, restoring the Primal Beginning, then it has never dispersed, never perished.\n\nMy Primordial Spirit-Tally, wondrous beyond attainment, shares names with things—yet my One has no name, and the true name never departs.\n\n*The Book of Changes* states: \"The sage uses this to wash the heart, retiring to conceal it in secrecy—fortune and misfortune shared with the people as common concerns.\" The spirit knows what is to come; wisdom conceals what has passed. The heart is the root of the seven emotions—joy, anger, sorrow, and delight—yet none are the heart’s essence. To shed emotions and purify nature is called \"washing the heart.\" When the heart is untainted by emotions, its purity abides of itself—this is called \"retiring to conceal it in secrecy.\" For me, this means engaging the world without truly engaging it, sharing the people’s concerns without truly sharing them. Thus, retiring to conceal in secrecy is to be without self; sharing the people’s concerns is to be without things. Within, no self; without, no things—then its beginning has no beginning, hence \"the spirit knows what is to come.\" Its end has no end, hence \"wisdom conceals what has passed.\"\n\nThe perfected person’s spirit-tally abides in the Great Beginning, wondrous beyond attainment—yet emerging, it can share names with things. Though it shares names with things, my One has no name. What is called \"wondrous beyond attainment\" is precisely \"retiring to conceal in secrecy.\" Sharing names with things is precisely \"sharing the people’s concerns.\" Though it shares names with things, my One has no name—thus, names may be shared, but the One cannot be shared; names may be named, but the One cannot be named. This is the meaning of \"no beginning, no end, the true name never departs.\" Clinging to names, names depart; grasping simplicity, simplicity scatters. To establish simplicity and erect names is to lose my truth. Guarding the nameless, stabilizing the uncarved—this is called \"primal simplicity,\" the wondrous Dao of long life and enduring vision.\n\nHaving a name is to be the same as things; being graspable is to be the same as vessels. Only by guarding the nameless and stabilizing the uncarved—without things, without vessels—can there be no gain, no loss. This is called \"long life and enduring vision.\"\n\n---\n\nChapter Eight, Two Hundred Eighteen Words\n\nVague and indistinct—within fire, the spirit is born.\nDeep and obscure—within water, essence is born.\nFire blazes upward, seven transformations give rise to spirit.\nWater flows downward, six evolutions give rise to essence.\nSeven and six transform and change, above and below complete each other.\nSpirit and essence come and go—from the wondrous body, the true is born.\nSpirit’s seven transformations give rise to true fire.\nEssence’s six evolutions give rise to true water.\nSix and seven make thirteen wonders.\n\nSpirit is born from the vague and indistinct, belonging to fire.\nEssence is born from the deep and obscure, belonging to water.\nFire’s nature is to ascend; water’s nature is to descend.\nAbove and below intermingle, spirit and essence come and go.\nThus, within water there is fire; within fire there is water.\nWithin essence there is spirit; within spirit there is essence.\nThis is called \"seven and six transform and change, above and below complete each other.\"\n\nHeaven’s One gives birth to water—its nature is fundamentally yang.\nIts form is completed in six and belongs to yin.\nEarth’s Two gives birth to fire—its nature is fundamentally yin.\nIts form is completed in seven and belongs to yang.\nWater is born above yet its nature descends; fire is born below yet its nature ascends.\n\n*Zhuangzi* says: \"Utmost yin is solemn; utmost yang is blazing. Solemn qi emerges from heaven; blazing qi issues from earth.\" Solemn qi originally emerges from heaven—Heaven’s One in operation descends and moves downward. Midway, it intersects with Heaven’s Five, taking form as six, giving birth to water and belonging to earth. Blazing qi originally issues from earth—Earth’s Two in operation rises and moves upward. Midway, it intersects with Heaven’s Five, taking form as seven, giving birth to fire and belonging to heaven. Thus, water is fundamentally of heaven yet its completion is of earth—within humans, it is essence. Fire is fundamentally of earth yet its completion is of heaven—within humans, it is spirit. Hence, it is called \"six evolutions, seven transformations.\" Seven and six transformations combine to make thirteen. Yet these thirteen are but the forms of water and fire—their already transformed, already evolved substance, not the primal transformation or primal evolution.\n\nThe wonder of my utmost truth: the true One is born from the beginning of wondrous numbers. Within spirit, essence and I are born into life; within essence, spirit and I enter death. Death is not annihilation; life is not flourishing. Know, guard, and employ the thirteen wonders—long life and enduring vision. My Dao unites with the true; this is called the \"true person.\"\n\nThirteen is the completion of numbers, the substance of water and fire. When water and fire meet as substances, they clash and cannot coexist. Only the primal numbers of water and fire—true water concealed within true fire, true fire concealed within true water—remain uncorrupted. This is what *The Book of Changes* means by \"water and fire do not repel each other,\" referring to the capacity of true water and fire to coexist.\n\nThe perfected person knows this: seeking water’s truth in the heart, matching it with mercury in the heart; seeking fire’s truth in the kidneys, matching it with lead in the kidneys. The heart is spirit—within spirit there is essence, and that essence is indestructible. The kidneys are essence—within essence there is spirit, and that spirit is imperishable. Though born into life, it is not truly born—hence \"life is not flourishing.\" Though entering death, it does not die—hence \"death is not annihilation.\" The true person, within the thirteen forms, recognizes the thirteen wonders, knows and guards them—long life and enduring vision.\n\nThe true person embraces the One, attains the One, and contains the true. Heaven’s fire is spirit; earth’s water is essence. Heaven and earth’s spirit and essence, seven and six water and fire—I unite them as the true. Returning the thirteen to the wondrous, the true One is natural. Wondrous numbers unite with the true—the Dao of entering death and emerging into life is attained.\n\nWater and fire are two things, sharing the same origin yet differing in form, mutually overcoming yet mutually completing. Only the true person can then unite them. Thus, they embrace them to prevent separation, attain them to prevent dispersion, and contain them to prevent differentiation. Uniting heaven and earth’s spirit and essence, seven and six water and fire, all fulfill their functions. Only by returning the thirteen to the wondrous does the true One become natural.\n\nIf one does not know the thirteen’s return to the wondrous but merely relies on the dead substance of water and fire without following their origin, they will mutually overcome—water will fail, fire will scatter, and death will come before the morning is over. Ignorant of the thirteen wondrous numbers, one loses the true and courts death—this I call \"true death.\"\n\nTrue death is true annihilation, from which one cannot return to the constant. Only by knowing the mutual nourishment of true water and fire does one then know the mutual generation of spirit and essence. To be ignorant of their numerical exchange is to cause things to lose their nourishment. When things lose their nourishment, death follows—this is called true death.\n\nHeaven generates spirit, earth generates essence. When heaven and earth unite in wondrous harmony, the true One remains unchanging. The Dao of the boundless is my true and supreme—this is called the Supreme True Dao.\n\nThat heaven generates spirit and earth generates essence is possessed by all things. Yet to unite heaven and earth’s spirit and essence, to know that within spirit lies essence and within essence lies spirit, and to enable the true One to remain unchanging—only the perfected person can achieve this. This is called the Supreme True Dao.\n\n**Chapter Nine, One Hundred Fifty Characters**\n\nSun as fire, moon as water; sun as spirit, moon as essence. Spirit-soul and essence-corporeal soul endure as heaven and earth. The thirteen wondrous numbers—no thing can escape them. One transformation, one transmutation, floating and sinking like ghosts and spirits, the shifting of sun and moon.\n\nYang originates from yin, yin originates from yang. At the summer solstice, yin is born in heaven; at the winter solstice, yang is born in earth. Thus, within water lies fire, within fire lies water; within spirit lies essence, within essence lies spirit. In humans, this is the embrace of soul and corporeal soul; in things, it is the enduring of heaven and earth. All are the thirteen wondrous numbers—no thing can escape them.\n\nYet people do not recognize their transformations, so yang is exhausted in yang-fire, rising without descending; yin is exhausted in yin-water, sinking without ascending. If one knows their transformations, the dragon emerges from fire, mercury from cinnabar—recognizing the utmost yin within the heart. The tiger arises from water, silver from lead—recognizing the utmost yang within the kidneys. Naturally, dragon and tiger unite, lead and mercury pair. Internally, the elixir may be formed; externally, things may be perfected. This is called floating and sinking like ghosts and spirits, the shifting of sun and moon.\n\nThe ancient saying goes: *\"The perfected person seizes the intent of creation, grasping sun and moon to place within the furnace.\"* It also says: *\"The art of inverting the Five Phases—dragons emerge from fire, tigers arise from water.\"* Thus it is.\n\nHeaven and earth are most true—this is my beginning.\n\nBefore differentiation, the undivided merges as the One True. I now guard the Primordial Beginning—dim and indistinct, I do not perceive the thirteen wondrous numbers, nor the Dao of spontaneity, for they reside in my Three Essentials. I know these essentials, yet I know not their marvels. This speaks of water and fire: though true, they are not the True.\n\nMy utmost True begins with me. Before differentiation, the united becomes the True. At this very moment, what are water and fire? I guard the Primordial Beginning—dim and indistinct—what then are the thirteen wondrous numbers, or the Dao of spontaneity? They intermingle and complete one another, evolving from the One into the Three.\n\nThe Three are thus: water as one, fire as two, and their union as three. This is called the Three Essentials. Once the Three Essentials are achieved, they naturally pair and harmonize—no agent compels them. In me, they have never been separate; yet I know not their marvels. This is not deliberate ignorance, but rather spontaneous completion—though unknown, it may be so.\n\nFirmly established in the Great Beginning, guarding and stabilizing the Primordial Origin, the Dao unites with the Primordial True. I enter the boundless and infinite, refining through eons to crystallize the wondrous One, the numinous origin. The numbers of dimness, the True of profound obscurity, the spirit of spontaneity—these give birth to the Primordial Beginning and culminate in the Primordial Ultimate. The wondrous numbers of the Great True, the true Dao of the Primordial Beginning—when the Primordial Beginning employs them, they perfectly form heaven and earth.\n\nBy refining and transforming water and fire, by intermingling and nurturing the spirit, one may attain the Dao, yet this is not the utmost. The utmost must lie in firm establishment in the Great Beginning, in guarding and stabilizing the Primordial Origin, in the Dao uniting with the Primordial True, in entering the boundless, in refining through eons to crystallize the wondrous One, the numinous origin. The spirit of spontaneity—without beginning or end, neither number nor non-number, neither Dao nor non-Dao—only then can one transform the myriad things. The Primordial Beginning employs this to form heaven and earth.\n\n*Primordial Beginning’s Exegesis of the Precelestial Dao and Virtue Classic, Scroll Four, Concluded*\n*Category: Original Texts, Cavern of Perfection Division*\n\n*Primordial Beginning’s Exegesis of the Precelestial Dao and Virtue Classic*\n*Text title: Primordial Beginning’s Exegesis of the Precelestial Dao and Virtue Classic.

Though dispersed, clarity is the source of turbidity, stillness the foundation of movement, both originally issuing from the One.\nIf one can know the One, then the Dao returns to restore True.\nFrom Nonbeing entering Being, True generates the Dao.\nFrom the mundane entering the sagely, the Dao generates True.\nWhen True emerges to wander in the Dao, the myriad things all attain it.\nThe eightfold functions interweave; the Three Origins revolve; beginning with the vast, nothing is not minute.\nThe Dao’s origin cycles through the beginning, round above and square below, horizontally uniting as one—such is the Dao’s law of spontaneity.\n\nThe inception of Heaven and Earth derives from the Four Great Ones:\nFire and wind form shape, dwelling in the southeast.\nEarth and water form shape, dwelling in the northwest.\nThe Four Great Ones transform into the eight trigrams:\nWind congeals into wood, wood the mother of fire, thus governed by Zhen and Xun.\nWood is the residual qi of wind.\nEarth hardens into metal, metal the mother of water, thus governed by Kun and Dui.\nMetal is the residual qi of earth.\nQian, too, is metal dwelling in the northwest; Gen, too, is wood dwelling in the northeast.\nThus the Four Great Ones divide into the eight trigrams, the eight trigrams shift into the Five Phases, mutually generating and mutually overcoming—hence the eightfold functions interweave.\n\nThe primordial and clear becomes Heaven; the yellow and turbid becomes Earth.\nHeaven is utmost yang—at summer solstice, yin is born in Heaven.\nEarth is utmost yin—at winter solstice, yang is born in Earth.\nClear and turbid intermingle, modeling Heaven and emulating Earth; standing between them is Man—this is the Three Origins revolving.\nThe Dao begins with the vastest, its square without fixed form; it extends to the minutest, no subtlety left unpervaded.\nThe Dao encircles the myriad things: Heaven is round above, Earth square below, Man horizontal in the center—three uniting as one, all following spontaneity.\n\nThe Primordial Emperor wanders in the origin—I lose the Primordial Beginning.\nWhen the origin-Dao completes its cycle, it returns to the Primordial Beginning.\nOnce the eight trigrams are established, the Emperor emerges from Zhen, aligns with Xun—here the qi of wood reaches its apex.\nWind and wood interact, the power of fire begins to manifest, thus they meet in Li.\nWhen the qi of fire forms dust, dust congeals to generate earth—those who attain know not its generation; those who serve do not generate of themselves, yet their generation is entrusted.\nFire does not generate earth; when fire subsides, earth forms of itself—this is attaining and serving in Kun.\nEarth congeals into marsh, marsh moisture generates metal; metal’s hardness has sound, thus it completes speech in Dui.\nMetal and earth pair; metal is the mother of water. Their qi mutually overcome, thus they contend in Qian.\nOnce Qian’s metal is pure, water issues from its mother, flowing without cease—thus it toils in Kan.\nWhen water overflows, it returns to the origin. Wood is water’s child; the mother goes to join the child. Wind and water harmonize, water returns to wind, restoring the Primordial True.\nThus it is said: beginning the myriad things, ending the myriad things—none surpasses Gen.\nAs the eightfold functions interweave, the Emperor emerges from Zhen, wandering the eight directions. The marvel of the Primordial Beginning scatters among the myriad things—hence it is said: the Primordial Emperor wanders in the origin—I lose the Primordial Beginning.\nWhen the origin-Dao completes its cycle, things reach Gen to accomplish the year’s work; humans refine essence to transform into spirit, thereby returning to the Dao of the Primordial Beginning.\n\nThe Three Ones are Qian; the Six Origins are Kun. Qian is odd, Kun even—the eight trigrams begin to arise.\nThus: wearing nine, treading one; left three, right seven; two and four as shoulders, six and eight as feet; five residing in the center. Vertically and horizontally, eightfold shifts—nothing loses the fifteen. This is the Five Transformations, Eight Shifts, the spirit-Dao of True Unity.\n\nThe Dao generates Dao-form; form in turn generates the Dao. The Dao again generates form—coming and going above and below, Dao-form and Dao-qi, form and qi ascending and descending—my Dao completes one cycle.\nThe forms of the multitude cannot generate the Dao; they ultimately return to dissolution. Even the forms of Heaven and Earth cannot escape this.\nWhat makes humans noble above Heaven and Earth is their capacity to employ Heaven and Earth, coming and going above and below, unbound by form or qi.\nThus they enter fire without burning, enter water without wetting; when united, they form a body; when scattered, they form a pattern. Dao-qi and form return to Nonbeing.\n\nThe Dao has no use; virtue has no action. Yet use unceasing becomes boundless; action unrelenting becomes infinite. Pressed, wondrous transformation is achieved—above, the image; below, the form; the Primordial Emperor wanders in the center. Ending its beginning, beginning its end—the Emperor’s origin and the Dao return.\nNot knowing that my generation of the Dao restores True attainment, I enter my Primordial Beginning.\nThe Dao takes non-use as its use; virtue takes non-action as its action.\nThe use of non-use is use without cease.\nThe action of non-action is action without end.\nThus within the un-wondrous and un-transformed, wondrous transformation is pressed into being.\n“Pressed into being” means “immediately achieved.”\nThis is what is meant by not destroying worldly dharmas yet attaining the true aspect. People merely see its image in Heaven, its form on Earth, yet do not know the Emperor wanders within—ending yet beginning, beginning yet ending. Things have their beginning and end; I have no beginning or end. Things have their arising and ceasing; I have no arising or ceasing.\nWith the Dao returning to the Dao, with True returning to True, I enter my spirit-origin.\n\nOne True, eight spirits, twenty-four Dao-paths, seventy-two shifts.\nThe Three Origins divide their functions; the eight spirits share differences. Uniting with the Dao as True, one cycle is inexhaustible—origin-Dao is everlasting.\nI say: the Great Dao is One, beginning and end return to my constancy.\nOne True is one year; eight spirits are the eight solar terms; twenty-four Dao-paths are the twenty-four qi; seventy-two shifts are the seventy-two pentads.\nHeaven, Earth, and Man employ the Three Origins; hardness, softness, yin, and yang interweave the eight trigrams. Though thus divided, their divisions all arise from spontaneity.\nIn their utmost spontaneity, they unite with the Dao as True, cycling without end, generating without exhaustion—hence it is said: origin-Dao is everlasting.\n\nThe Dao’s beginning and end, though scattered into thousands and myriads, when returning to the One, do not lose my constancy.\n\n**Chapter Two: Sixty-Four Sayings**\nThe Dao is not Dao, the spirit is not spirit—when not Dao, the Dao I do not see; when not spirit, the spirit I do not know.\nThe knower is not my spirit; the seer is not my Dao.\nDao-things, spirit-things, ghost-things—all things.\nAttaining the Dao, attaining the spirit, attaining the True.\nWhen the True regains the spirit, it also regains the Dao, also regains my non-attainment—this is called primordial virtue.\nExcellent in lending and in completion.\n\nThe Dao cannot be seen, the spirit cannot be made spirit—yet unseen, it sees itself; unspirited, it spirits itself.\nThus within wondrous emptiness, not by ear does it hear, not by eye does it see.\nUnified in wondrous awareness, the six senses are undivided; roots and dust dissolve, the numinous light shines alone—\nnot Dao yet Dao, not spirit yet spirit—this is the marvel of spontaneity.\n\nThe Dao descends to become things, its distinctions being four:\nDao-things transform their spirit, spirit-things transform their soul,\nghost-things transform their corporeal soul, all things transform their form.\nWhen form decays, things perish; when the corporeal soul disperses, ghosts vanish;\nwhen the soul weakens, the spirit scatters—only the spirit does not perish.\nWhen the spirit is whole, the Dao is wondrous, exhausting the hidden and manifest—nothing lies beyond these four.\nDao-things become immortals and perfected beings; spirit-things become divine spirits;\nghost-things become shades of the unseen; all things become the ten thousand transformations.\nYet these four may also attain the Dao, attain the spirit, attain the True—\nfor their primordial origin is the same.\n\nThe perfected person not only enables all things to attain the Dao,\nbut also allows each True to attain its True, each Dao to attain its Dao.\nI, through non-attainment, attain the Dao and attain the True—this is called primordial virtue.\n\"Lending\" means to borrow in order to complete—\nthe perfected person lends the Dao to aid beings, hence it is said: excellent in lending and in completion.\n\n**Chapter Three: Thirty-Two Sayings**\nHeaven’s origin, the Emperor’s Dao, Earth’s transformation—three that are fitting.\n\n**Chapter Three: Thirty-Two Sayings (continued)**\n\nThe primordial gives birth to spirit; transformation gives birth to form; the Dao gives birth to function.\nFunction without function—non-action yet nothing left undone.\nThe Dao responds to above and below; the Emperor’s function knows no end.\nIn Heaven it is the primordial; in the Emperor it is the Dao; on Earth it is transformation—these three unite to achieve success.\nHeaven’s primordial in man becomes spirit; Earth’s transformation in man becomes form; the Emperor’s Dao generates function.\nThe *Book of Changes* says: \"Heaven and Earth establish their positions; the sage fulfills their capacities.\"\nTo fulfill capacities is to say the Emperor’s Dao generates function.\nFunction yet no function; act yet non-action—through the Dao one completes Heaven and completes virtue, hence the Emperor’s function knows no end.\n\n**Chapter Four: Seventeen Sayings**\nHeaven, Earth, man, ghosts, and spirits—the Dao blends them into the primordial, their beginning beyond recognition. My Dao has long been accomplished.\nHeaven, Earth, man, ghosts, and spirits—these five each follow separate paths.\nYet their origin emerges from a single source, merging into the Dao.\nWhen divided into these five, they undergo formation and decay, gathering and dispersion, bound by form and number, and thus inevitably reach their end.\nOnly when merged and undispersed is their beginning unrecognizable.\nOnly by being unrecognizable can they endure and be accomplished.\n\n**Chapter Five: Two Hundred Ten Sayings**\nThe primordial is luminous; transformation is obscure—the Dao’s function is hidden and manifest.\nThe primordial and the Emperor respond in function; the ten thousand things receive their mother, yet not knowing their child, who knows my ancestor?\nWhen things had not yet begun, there was obscurity dense and unmanifest.\nOnce the primordial becomes luminous and transformation obscure, life’s foundation is established—the Dao thereby is hidden, and thereby is revealed.\nIf one does not comprehend the primordial luminosity, one loses the True by following things; if the primordial luminosity is deluded by form, the Dao is hidden from then on.\nIf one comprehends the primordial luminosity and recognizes the knowledge of change, though life arises I know not its arising—then the Dao is revealed thereby.\nTo embody this response in function is called the primordial Emperor.\nThe ten thousand things chase after branches; I alone attain the root.\nWhy do people chase after branches? Because they know not that I emerge from the Dao.\nI am the Dao’s child—if one does not know the child, how can one know its origin?\nMy words on the image are wondrous and primordial.\nThe infant returns to me and does not depart, guarding the primordial mother—transformation arises from transformation, not hidden yet wondrous.\nWonder arises, wonder is accomplished, the wondrous Emperor enters and exits.\nIf there is selection, then wonder is not natural—the Dao abhors selection, hence essence is also wondrous, image is also wondrous.\nImage is that which completes the form of things.\nThough things complete their forms, my primordial beginning has never dispersed.\nIf one can always retain the heart of an infant, like a newborn babe unspoiled, the wonder of the primordial beginning returns to me and does not depart.\nKnow the child, guard the mother, employ transformation, follow transformation—I know not its transformation, so that in daily use, the manifest is not hidden yet wondrous of itself.\nArising from wonder, I know not its accomplishment—this is called the wondrous Emperor entering and exiting.\nMy primordial and primal Dao is subtle and unseen.\nThe ghostly Dao and spirit Emperor—function without function, no function yet inexhaustible—accomplishing the Emperor’s wondrous function, spirits and ghosts are unfathomable.\nI say: spirits are its gate, ghosts its door—its Dao unseen, its movement unknown.\nGhosts move, spirits wander—wonder is ever-changing.\nThe wonder of the primordial and primal Dao—though the ten thousand things are served by it, they know it not, hence its Dao can command ghosts and demons, the Emperor governs spirits and gods.\nFunction in no-function—function’s function is inexhaustible.\nThe Emperor governs the ten thousand things; spirits and ghosts are unfathomable.\nThe *Book of Rites* says: \"The virtue of ghosts and spirits—how abundant it is!\"\nSeen they cannot be, heard they cannot be—yet of things unfathomable, none are like ghosts and spirits.\nTo compare the Dao to ghosts and spirits is but to speak of its gate and door.\nAs for its inner chambers, how can they be known?\nIts Dao unseen, its movement unknown—like ghosts moving and spirits wandering, wonder is ever-changing, near as one’s eyelashes, yet none know it.\nVague and indistinct—the spirit’s mystery of the ten thousand things.\nFlickering and dim—the ghost’s dwelling of the ten thousand things.\nThe Dao moves in true transformation—the numinous chamber of the profound and dark.\nUtterly empty, supremely vast—the primordial abides in the Dao’s peace.\nSpirit wonder, Emperor quiescence—ear and eye cannot attain it.\nVague and indistinct—who knows vagueness and indistinctness?\nProfound and dark—who knows profundity and darkness?\nThose who know them are neither vague nor indistinct, neither profound nor dark—taking it is unrestrained, using it is inexhaustible.\nThis is called the spirit’s mystery, also the ghost’s dwelling, also the numinous chamber.\nI first transform the numinous chamber—from non-being to being, the wonder of the primordial and primal, a single aperture to its True.\nThe so-called aperture is to open things and accomplish affairs.\nThough it opens to the True, the original wonder’s essence does not disperse or perish—taking no-image as image, hence it is called \"aperture-containing.\"\nTaking no-spirit as spirit, hence it is called \"spirit Emperor.\"\nUtterly empty, supremely vast—though dispersed as the Dao, yet dispersion does not lose the primordial, hence the Dao has no great or small, and abides in all peacefully.\nThough the Emperor’s function is boundless, yet function does not lose spirit, hence its function is also quiescent and unseen, residing in the midst of nothingness.\nHearing not with the ear, seeing not with the eye—ear and eye cannot attain it, how much less the perceptions of sound and form?\nThe Buddhist scriptures speak of \"in emptiness there is no eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, or mind\"—this is it.\nThe True Person’s primordial wonder—the Dao’s origin is subtle, movement issues in response and attainment, function inexhaustible.\nThe Dao and things conceal each other—not empty, not full, not seizing, not taking—vessels remain not constant, the Dao returns without cease, hence I am inexhaustible as such.\nThe Dao’s origin is subtle, yet its use is inexhaustible—thus it is not subtle in truth.\nFor within it, much and little, being and non-being are but the discriminations of former dust, yet the Dao and things concealing each other cannot be measured by appearances.\nThus great and small, subtle and vast, empty and full, full and empty, seizing and taking, taking and seizing—are not bound by the limitations of form and vessel.\nOnly when it comes to form and vessel do they remain and obstruct, not constant, and thus arise distinctions of great and small, vast and subtle.\n\nThe Dao emerges through forms and vessels, its function ceaseless—thus I am inexhaustible as such.\n\n**Chapter Six (159 characters)**\nSubtle transformation, subtle transmutation—nothing is not subtle.\nPrimordial transformation, primordial transmutation—nothing is not primordial.\nSpiritual transformation, spiritual transmutation—nothing is not spiritual.\nTrue transformation, true transmutation—nothing is not true.\nDao-transformation, Dao-transmutation—nothing is not Dao.\nOne transformation, one transmutation—nothing is not one.\n\nWhen subtlety reaches \"nothing is not subtle,\" then subtlety resides in tiles and pebbles.\nWhen the Dao reaches \"nothing is not Dao,\" then the Dao resides in weeds and chaff.\nNow, if one points to tiles, pebbles, weeds, or chaff and calls them the Dao—is this permissible?\nYet tiles, pebbles, weeds, and chaff have never ceased to be the congealment of forms and vessels.\nThose who perceive the provisional see only the provisional; those who perceive the real see only the real.\nAs for their congealed forms, they are equal to heaven and earth.\nThus, to say \"subtlety resides in tiles and pebbles\" and \"the Dao resides in weeds and chaff\"—how could this be an exaggeration?\n\nBuddhist scriptures discuss perfect enlightenment, holding that hells and heavenly palaces are the same pure land,\nthat nirvana and birth-and-death share the same dharma-nature.\nAll precepts, meditative absorptions, and wisdoms, as well as lust, anger, and delusion,\nare the accomplished dharmas of the Brahmanic path, external paths, and bodhi—\nall are the wisdom of bodhi, and ignorance likewise becomes prajñā.\nThis is what is meant by the Buddhas’ compliance with awakened nature—\nprecisely the meaning of \"one transformation, one transmutation—nothing is not one.\"\n\nScattered without direction, their number cannot be reckoned—hence they are called innumerable.\nSix transformations and three primordials constitute the great transformation;\nsix transmutations and three primordials constitute the great transmutation.\nScattered without direction, they extend to ten, a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand,\neven to an incalculable degree.\nIf one were to exhaust them one by one, each expressing its difference,\nthen liver and gallbladder would be as distant as Chu and Yue—\nin this case, one might as well call them numerable.\nBut if one returns to the one, tracing their origin to the Dao,\nthen the vast distance between Hu and Yue has never been different—\nin this case, one might as well call them innumerable.\n\nBound by form, entangled in number, they must eventually reach an end.\nThus, the number of transformations and transmutations culminates at eighteen.\nThe *Book of Changes* states: \"With eighteen changes, a hexagram is completed.\"\nThe \"eighteen\" refers to six transformations and three primordials.\nThe initial line of a hexagram is three; doubling it makes six.\nThe hexagram’s beginning is three primordials; its doubling is six transformations.\nEach line undergoes three changes; multiplying three by six yields eighteen—\nthus the number is exhausted.\n\nHeaven’s six transformations make eighteen; earth’s six transmutations make eighteen.\nCombined, they total thirty-six. Extended tenfold, they become three hundred sixty—\nall are exhausted here.\nThe revolutions of the sun and moon, the numbers of heaven and earth—\nall are exhausted here.\n\nThe one cannot be obtained; the Dao cannot be obtained; the true cannot be obtained;\nthe spiritual cannot be obtained; the primordial cannot be obtained; the subtle cannot be obtained.\nTo obtain them is called \"having obtained.\"\nWhen above and below exchange virtue, one loses what one has obtained.\nNot obtaining them is called \"lacking virtue.\"\nThe Dao cannot be obtained; if one obtains non-obtainment, this is called \"obtaining the Dao.\"\nIf one perceives having obtained, this is called \"losing attainment.\"\nObtaining attainment yields virtue; non-obtainment yields the Dao.\n\nOne returns to the Dao, the Dao returns to the true, the true returns to the spiritual,\nthe spiritual returns to the primordial, the primordial returns to the subtle.\nAt ultimate subtlety, there is no return—transformation and transmutation cease.\nThis Dao is unsurpassed; I call it the highest.\nObtaining the subtle Dao, one enters the beginningless.\n\n\"Return\" means returning from being to emptiness, from end to root, from flow to origin.\nWhy do people follow the current downward and forget to return?\nExternal things entice them.\nIf external things hold no allure, then inner gravity prevails, and one does not flow downward.\nHaving ceased to flow downward, one must return upward.\nAt the extreme of return upon return, reaching the point of no return—\nthis is the ultimate Dao.\n\n**Chapter Seven (114 characters)**\nSubtle purity, primordial purity; subtle primordial, pure and subtle.\nThe great root is primordially pure; subtle purity, primordial subtlety.\nThe return of purity to the root—my spirit regains purity.\nThe Dao emerges from purity; purity gives birth to the Dao.\n\nThe origin of things is pure unity, undefiled.\nThough it cannot be named as purity, apart from purity there is no name for it.\nThus it is said: \"Subtle purity, primordial purity; the great root is primordially pure.\"\nTo study the Dao, one must begin with purity.\nIf one can always remain pure, heaven and earth will all return—\nthus it is said: \"Purity gives birth to the Dao.\"\n\nWithin the wondrous palace of purity, there is the true Dharma of pure contention.\nThe true one is not seen; the one cannot be obtained.\nPurity does not lie in innumerability.\nThe subtle Dao’s Dharma is purity—though it pervades, it is not defiled.\nThus, innumerability is also undefiled.\n\nThe wondrous palace of purity contains the true Dharma of purity.\nThis is to say that worldly people do not recognize the essence of purity,\nmistaking non-action for purity—\nhence the explicit revelation of the true Dharma to dispel this error.\nWhat is commonly called true purity is the true one not being seen.\nIf the true one is not seen, then the myriad dharmas cannot be obtained.\nWith the myriad dharmas empty, even the one cannot be seen.\nThus, there is nothing not pure, nothing not clean.\n\nIt is also said: \"Purity does not lie in innumerability.\"\nThis is because worldly people take innumerability as purity,\nclaiming to seek purity yet finding it unattainable.\nThus, the Daoist *Dingguan Jing* verse states:\n\"Wisdom arises from conditions; fire arises from causes.\nEach attains its true nature,\nyet riding the current, one loses the Dao’s origin.\"\nWhen the mind arises, one wishes to cease knowing,\nbut the arising of mind only increases vexation.\nIf one knows that knowing is fundamentally empty,\nknowing becomes the gateway to the myriad wonders.\n\nThe Buddhist *Xin Ming* also states:\n\"To cease movement is to return to cessation, yet cessation only amplifies movement.\nClinging to either pole, how can one know the one?\nIf one place is obstructed, two places lose their efficacy.\nDeluded by being and non-being, one turns from emptiness to oppose emptiness.\"\n\nNow, illuminating these two verses in mutual elucidation reveals the true Dharma of purity.\nThe *Dingguan* verse says: \"Wisdom arises from conditions; fire arises from causes.\"\nWisdom and fire are the mind’s wisdom.\nAs wisdom pursues conditions, the mind clings to things, and emotions arise.\nYet before they scatter, the nature of awakened understanding and the seed of illumination—\nboth emerge from the true.\n\nWhen this flow scatters, the origin of the Dao is lost. Yet this flowing current cannot be forcibly severed, for it is fundamentally the wondrous luminosity—the true, singular nature—flowing naturally, without any separate substance. If one generates the mind to grasp or suppress it, seeking to still the knowing mind, one only compounds disturbance. Thus it is said: \"To arise the mind desiring to still knowing, the mind arises and knowing grows more vexed.\" If one knows that ignorance is originally no different, yet through self-attachment one loses the pure essence—moment after moment, arising thoughts are each emptied, then from beginningless time, the accumulated weight of habitual tendencies suddenly becomes lucid and bright. When all is lucid and bright, this is the gateway to the myriad wonders. The Buddhist *Xin Ming* is no different in this regard. It speaks of using cessation to still movement, yet movement cannot be stilled, only adding more cessation-mind. Thus one clings to both poles, how can one know the singular purity? Movement and stillness are originally one, yet through self-differentiation they become distinct. Hence, that becomes separate from this—this is what is meant by \"if one place is obstructed, two places lose their efficacy.\" If one merely abandons impurity to seek purity, impurity cannot be removed. This is delusion by being, falling into being, turning from emptiness to oppose emptiness.\n\nThis sutra states: Purity does not lie in having no phenomena. Though the Dao scatters into hundreds, thousands, myriads, and billions, it remains without phenomena. Thus, having phenomena is also purity, and having no phenomena is also purity. For all things are originally pure; though they spread, they do not mix. Having phenomena does not mix, and having no phenomena does not mix. Purity is non-action; non-action is purity. The Dao is the pure, flowing source of all things. Unmixed yet not separate, scattered yet not lost. The pure flow of the Dao is the wondrous, originally pure sea. Why do I not return to it?\n\nPurity is non-action; non-action is purity. Non-action that acts is called the Dao-acting. Though the Dao-acting does not fail to act, it does not lose purity. The Dao is the origin of things; all things possess the Dao. Though mixed, they do not blend; though scattered, they do not lose the real. Only those who embody the Dao recognize this. Thus they can reverse the flow, preserve wholeness, and merge with the Dao’s current, returning to purity. The great sea has no current that does not return—this is called \"returning flow.\"\n\n**Chapter Eight, Thirty-Three Sayings**\nPurity gives rise to movement; movement gives rise to purity. I dwell in the wondrous movement of purity. Stillness is the essence of movement; movement is the function of stillness. When there is no affair, one abides in profound clarity, not bound by stillness. When affairs arise, one responds with non-mind, not turning with movement. As the *Dingguan* says: \"Abiding in clamor without aversion, engaging in affairs without vexation—this is true samadhi.\" One does not seek many affairs because of being unvexed by affairs, nor does one forcefully enter clamor because of being unaverse to clamor. Taking no-affair as the true dwelling and affairs as responsive traces—this is the meaning of purifying one’s abode, the wondrous movement of purity.\n\nThe Dao’s flow is perilous; its source is purity. All movements are one current; purity flows universally—this is the wondrous attainment. When water flows far, traversing perilous terrain, how can it remain necessarily pure? Yet its source must be pure. The Dao flows through things, traversing the world—how can it remain necessarily pure? Yet its origin must be pure. Though movements are many, their flow is one. Though things are numerous, their principle is one. Thus it is said: Purity flows universally. Those who attain it are pure in all things—hence, it is called wondrous.\n\n**Chapter Nine, One Hundred Seventy-Three Sayings**\nFlow arises from the solid; the Dao is empty and pure. Purity gives rise to emptiness—valley’s wondrousness, valley’s flow is purity. Movement arises from the solid; purity arises from emptiness. The mind empty, then still; the mind solid, then moving. What is meant by \"solid\"? Joy, anger, love, aversion—these obstruct it. If internally unobstructed, then the center is empty. An empty center is never impure. *Zhuangzi* says: \"If a room has no heavenly wandering, then mistress and maid will quarrel. If the mind has no heavenly wandering, then the six senses will contend.\" Heavenly wandering is called emptiness. Empty, then responsive—thus it is said: The valley contains all things; this is the valley’s wondrousness.\n\nThe Dao’s imperial flow is unimpeded, pure and without obstruction. Having phenomena, having no phenomena—responding to purity without daring to transgress. That by which purity is pure is its response without losing purity. Only by responding without losing purity can it be pure in all things. Thus the Dao’s imperial flow circulates through the myriad existences without obstruction. Purity without phenomena is emptiness. Having no phenomena is being. Responding to being and non-being without losing wondrous purity—thus the sutra says: \"Constantly responding, constantly pure, constantly pure indeed.\"\n\nPurity and wondrousness give rise to the numinous; the empty and singular transform. Pure and wondrous, without beginning—wondrousness without end, purity without end. The beginningless flows back. My beginninglessness is wondrous and unfathomable purity; purity is unfathomably wondrous. Purity is natural—from this it is attained. Purity gives rise to wondrousness, engaging the myriad existences, yet the numinous and empty singularly transform—being has never been being. Pure and wondrous, vast and boundless, without beginning, non-being yet not nothing. Thus wondrousness has no end—this is called the natural, unobservable. My wondrous Dharma gives rise to purity.\n\nArising without end, it completes heaven and earth, beginning with the primordial One. The pure, wondrous flow—up and down, containing the wondrousness of purity within. Purity, spirit, emptiness. Without form, without qi, purity enters and exits, stabilized in the heaven of purity. The original wondrous Dharma arises from purity. Arising without exhausting the origin, in non-action without end. Non-action has never had action, yet does not depart from action, even to the completion of heaven and earth—up and down, the pure, spiritual, and empty constantly flow within, without form, without qi, governing the myriad things, entering and exiting purity. Thus it is called the heaven of purity.\n\n*Mencius* says: \"Exhausting one’s mind, one knows one’s nature. Knowing one’s nature, one knows Heaven.\" He also says: \"Preserving the mind and nourishing the nature, one serves Heaven.\"\n\nHeaven is the wondrous purity of the original beginning—without form, without qi. The affliction of humanity lies in the inability to restore one’s nature; if nature is not restored, the mind is not exhausted. What is not exhausted refers to the failure to forget joy, anger, sorrow, and delight. From joy, anger, sorrow, and delight, the mind transforms into emotion; when these arise without moderation, emotion becomes the master. Thus the mind is not exhausted. If, amid joy, anger, sorrow, and delight, one can respond with compliance, so that though joy, anger, sorrow, and delight exist, their roots are extinguished of emotion—within the roots, response is extinguished by nature—then what arises will necessarily be moderate, and harmony and principle will emerge. In this way, there is joy yet not joy, anger yet not anger, and likewise sorrow and delight yet not sorrow and delight: this is called exhausting the mind and restoring nature. When the mind is exhausted and nature is pure, it cannot but be called Heaven.\n\nThe primordial emptiness is unmoving; the One Reality universally arises. Purity wondrously pervades; the Dao abides in its beginning. The Great One is inexhaustible; I enter the beginning and end of purity. The Way of divine transcendence is nothing but purity. The primordial emptiness is spontaneous, never having moved. As for the One Reality universally arising, every thing receives the grace of purity, flowing and circulating without end. Knowing the beginning as without beginning, knowing the end as without end—through the Great One, it is called inexhaustible. If one knows there is a beginning, the three divisions are not severed. If the three divisions are not severed, the past becomes the beginning. Once the beginning has passed, the present is the middle. If the middle division does not abide, the future is the end. The end is yet to come, and with every encounter, the three divisions form. How can there be purity? Only when the three divisions are severed, the beginning is without beginning, and then the end is without end. Thus it is said: I enter the beginning and end of purity.\n\n*Commentary on the Precelestial Classic of Dao and Virtue*, Scroll Five, concludes.",

Annotated by Li Jiamou of the Song Dynasty. Five fascicles.\n\n*The Primordial Origin’s Precelestial Dao and Virtue Classic* is distinct from Laozi’s *Dao and Virtue Classic*. Modeled after Laozi’s work, it is divided into five sections: *Mystery* (妙), *Origin* (元), *Spirit* (神), *Authenticity* (真), and *Dao* (道). Li’s annotations proceed chapter by chapter, elucidating the text in sequence.\n\n**Source of the Base Text:** *Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Unity* (《正統道藏》), *Dongzhen* Division, *Benwen* Category.\n\n---\n\n### **Preface to *The Primordial Origin’s Exegesis on the Precelestial Dao and Virtue Classic***\n\nThis classic was annotated chapter by chapter by Master Xizhai, Li Jun Jiamou of the former Song, and its woodblock edition circulated in Western Shu for many years. By the Baoyou era, Xian Tianzi Xie Gong Tunan wrote a preface to transmit it, though the Shu edition had already been lost.\n\nInitially, when Xie served as an official in Lingbiao, he sought this classic and eventually obtained it from the hands of a reclusive scholar from Shu—treasuring it as a rare gem. Later, upon arriving in Western Zhe, he presented it to Li Zengbo, Grand Academician of the Hall of Literary Inspection and Master Kezhai, who generously sponsored its reproduction. Li Kejiu, a Daoist from Jiaxing, then raised funds to have it carved and disseminated. They also acquired the so-called *Eight Mighty Dragon Script*, transmitted by an extraordinary adept of the Precelestial, and engraved it alongside the text, thus completing the work for posterity.\n\nAt the time, Grand Academician Li, who oversaw the Dongxiao Abbey, also wrote a preface. Both prefaces largely followed Xie’s account, identifying the five sections as the \"scattered fragments\" of the *Dao Classic*, claiming their composition was divinely manifested in the azure heavens—beyond human craft. Yet both scholars, in their reverence, perpetuated errors.\n\nNow, upon examination: The *Five Scattered Fragments* of the Primordial Origin’s *Anchoring Scripture* (安镇敷落), along with their true talismans and texts, resemble those transmitted among our disciples—talismanic writs formed in accordance with *qi*, manifesting as: (1) *Luminous Qi* (明炁), (2) *Great Cinnabar* (太丹), (3) *Yellow Authenticity* (黄真), (4) *Plain Might* (素威), and (5) *Mysterious Essence* (玄精). Such is their nature.\n\nThese five sections—*Mystery, Origin, Spirit, Authenticity,* and *Dao*—each comprising chapters, with each chapter a discourse, together totaling five thousand characters, have circulated alongside our *Laozi’s Dao and Virtue* (五千). Yet they differ entirely from the *Scattered Fragments*, bearing no relation to them.\n\nWhen the Wu Commandery’s Gui Fu Daoist Lei Suo Zhang Shanyuan obtained this text, he diligently raised funds to have it carved and transmitted. I append these words to the title’s end merely to clarify what may remain obscure to the reader upon opening the scroll, lest they mistake it for the *Scattered Fragments*.\n\n---\n\n### **The Primordial Origin’s Exegesis on the Precelestial Dao and Virtue Classic, Fascicle One**\n\n#### **Mystery Section: One Thousand Characters, Chapter One (220 Characters)**\n\nTrue Mystery is mystery; true Origin is origin; true Spirit is spirit; true Authenticity is authenticity; true Dao is Dao.\n\nThe Dao and virtue; virtue and the myriad things—thus the myriad things attain [their nature].\n\nThese five names are neither one nor five. The true is the Primordial Origin, unadulterated, unborrowed from external things. Only our singular authenticity: in Mystery, it is true Mystery; in Origin, true Origin; in Spirit, true Spirit; in Authenticity, true Authenticity; in Dao, true Dao.\n\nYet if one seeks to name these five, it cannot be done. It is like the eye’s faculty, which cannot see itself. Thus it is said: True Mystery is mystery; true Origin is origin; true Spirit is spirit; true Authenticity is authenticity; true Dao is Dao.\n\nTherefore, true Mystery does not know its mystery; true Origin does not know its origin; true Spirit does not know its spirit; true Authenticity does not know its authenticity; true Dao does not know its Dao. If they knew themselves, they would not be one.\n\nWhen the Dao is not one, it disperses into virtue. The myriad things each attain one [aspect of virtue], and virtue gives them life. Thus it is said: The myriad things attain [their nature].\n\nThings are born by attaining the Dao and die by losing it. Gain and loss give rise to one another; the Dao is the same in both emergence and withdrawal.\n\nThe myriad things, without exception, are born by receiving the Dao’s oneness. When what they receive departs, they die. Though called \"birth,\" it is merely the arrival of the Dao’s dispersion—what is called the Dao neither lives nor dies.\n\nBecause things cannot attain the Dao in its entirety, they are confined by life and death. Yet as they depend on the Dao, they are indestructible. Thus, life and death, gain and loss arise in succession, emerging and withdrawing in unison with the Dao.\n\nThe Dao cannot be equated with virtue. Virtue cannot be equated; loss cannot be equated.\n\nThus, what is attained is called \"equated.\" There is attainment and loss.\n\nThe Dao is the unadulterated original nature, like empty space, which does not commingle with things. Thus it is said: The Dao cannot be equated with virtue.\n\nThere is softness and hardness, benevolence and righteousness—affairs differ, names vary, like the myriad things, each with its own body. Thus it is said: Virtue cannot be equated.\n\nWhat is received is provisional and false; what is temporarily received is soon lost, like a traveler’s inn, where one rests briefly before departing. Thus it is said: Loss cannot be equated.\n\nWhat is called \"equated\" means: I have attained this, and so has that; each attains what it attains, and only then is it \"equated.\" Though \"equated\" approaches the Dao, seeking the Dao through attainment risks both gain and loss. The more one gains and loses, the farther one strays from the Dao.\n\nLosing virtue returns one to the Dao; the Dao gathers into oneness. Oneness attains authenticity; embodying authenticity responds to change. Authenticity enters the utmost Spirit; Spirit attains Spirit; Spirit enters Origin; Origin attains Origin; Origin enters Mystery.\n\nAbiding in stillness, it seems to exist yet is neither form nor sound. It stands alone in the Primordial Origin—the mystery of the Primordial Origin.\n\nVirtue is the dispersion of nature into affairs, unstable. Thus virtue may be lost, but the Dao is never lost. If virtue is lost, it returns to the Dao—there is no Dao apart from this.\n\nThe Dao resides between life and death, gain and loss, never not one. If one chases the changes of life and death, follows the names of gain and loss, it disperses into virtue. But if one knows it emerges from the Dao and gathers into oneness, then virtue is the Dao, and the Dao and virtue are one.",

      "translated_text": "Unity enters authenticity; embodying authenticity, it responds to change. Though myriad transformations arise, none lose my authenticity—this is called Spirit. The culmination of Spirit is called Origin; the attainment of Origin is called Mystery. Entering Origin, entering Mystery, in truth nothing is gained—only a return to the original state.\n\nNeither form nor sound, abiding in stillness as if existing yet not, standing alone in the Primordial Origin and Primordial Mystery—this is the inherent nature, not obtained from without. The Primordial Origin observes with true Mystery; the Primordial Origin listens with true Mystery. The wondrous gaze sees the formless form; the wondrous hearing perceives the soundless sound. The great image has no shape, yet nothing escapes my wondrous gaze. The supreme tone is soundless, yet nothing escapes my wondrous hearing. I take Mystery as the boundless and supreme.\n\nThe wondrous gaze is without color; the wondrous hearing is without sound. Beyond color and sound, external dust cannot obstruct. The six sense faculties interpenetrate and merge, thus seeing the formless form yet not through the eyes, hearing the soundless sound yet not through the ears. Perception dissolves into perfect clarity. The wondrous gaze transcends heaven and earth; the wondrous hearing surpasses sound and voice. Thus nothing is unseen, nothing unheard—this is called the boundless and supreme. Therefore, I am the boundless and supreme true Mystery.\n\nTrue Mystery, true Origin—true Origin cannot be Origin. True Mystery, true Spirit—true Spirit cannot be Spirit. True Mystery, true Authenticity—true Authenticity cannot be Authenticity. True Mystery, true Dao—true Dao cannot be Dao. True Mystery is ultimate.\n\nThis speaks of embodying Mystery, distinct from those who embody Origin, Authenticity, Spirit, or Dao. Having attained true Mystery, then Origin becomes wondrous Origin—true Origin cannot be Origin; Spirit becomes wondrous Spirit—true Spirit cannot be Spirit; Authenticity becomes wondrous Authenticity—true Authenticity cannot be Authenticity; Dao becomes wondrous Dao—true Dao cannot be Dao. From the Primordial Origin downward, though all share these five names, the wondrous power attained differs in each, with Mystery alone as the ultimate. Thus it is said: True Mystery is ultimate.\n\n**Chapter Two, One Hundred Forty-Six Characters**\n\nTrue Mystery is the Supreme; the Supreme is true Mystery. The ultimate of Dao cannot be named—it is provisionally called true Mystery. The ultimate of honor cannot be named—it is provisionally called the Supreme. Mystery is ultimate and beyond, thus called true Mystery. The Supreme is ultimate and transcendent, thus called the Supreme true Mystery.\n\nMystery gives rise to Origin; Origin gives rise to Spirit; Spirit gives rise to Authenticity; Authenticity gives rise to Dao; Dao gives rise to virtue; virtue gives rise to subtlety; subtlety gives rise to Mystery; Mystery gives rise to Non-being; Non-being gives rise to Being. Being is Being; Non-being is Non-being. Being and Non-being generate each other; yin and yang mutually transform—great transformation and change.\n\nThe descent of Mystery is called Origin; the descent of Origin is called Spirit; the descent of Spirit is called Authenticity; the descent of Authenticity is called Dao; the descent of Dao is called virtue; the descent of virtue is called subtlety. Subtlety is the lesser Dao. The multitude descend from Dao to virtue, from virtue to subtlety, and enter into Being. Once entering Being, they drift ever farther from the Dao. The perfected person ascends from subtlety back to Mystery, from Mystery into Non-being, from Non-being into Being—desiring to establish, they take Non-being as Being; desiring stillness, they take Being as Non-being. Desiring Being, it arises—heaven and earth do not make it more; desiring Non-being, it returns—Great Emptiness does not make it less. Through Being and Non-being, emerging in yang and entering yin, mutually generating and transforming, like the great changes of transformation.\n\nMystery has no form. Being has Non-being; Non-being has Being. I dwell in the constancy of subtlety and Mystery. The perfected person takes wondrous Non-being as essence and wondrous Being as function. Abiding in stillness is the essence of Non-being; responding endlessly to change is the function of Being. The function of Being arises from the essence of Non-being; the essence of Non-being manifests as the function of Being. Taking Being as subtlety and Non-being as Mystery, thus it is said: I dwell in the constancy of subtlety and Mystery.\n\nLaozi said: \"Constantly without desire, observe its Mystery; constantly with desire, observe its subtlety.\" These two emerge differently yet are called the same—profound. The worldly, embodying Non-being, cannot grasp Being; embodying Being, cannot grasp Non-being. Observing Mystery, they cannot perceive subtlety; observing subtlety, they cannot perceive Mystery. All are confined by forms and instruments, unable to enter and exit between Being and Non-being. The perfected person takes wondrous Non-being as essence, emerging into Being. Though the lesser Dao is not pursued, it is not insufficient to enter Non-being; though embodying Mystery, it is not excessive. For they take Being and Non-being, subtlety and Mystery as constant. Thus subtlety is Mystery; Mystery is subtlety; Being is Non-being; Non-being is Being. Therefore it is said: \"Emerging differently, they are called the same—profound.\"\n\nThe constancy of subtlety and Mystery is called Dao. The constancy of Dao is called Authenticity. The constancy of Authenticity is called Spirit. The constancy of Spirit is called Origin. The constancy of Origin is called Mystery. The constancy of Mystery is called I. Dwelling in the boundless.\n\nThe Mystery of Origin-Mystery is unchanging and unaltered—thus called constant. Subtlety is Being; Mystery is Non-being. Being is also Non-being; Non-being is also Being—this is the constancy of subtlety and Mystery. The constancy of subtlety and Mystery is then Dao. The constancy of Dao is Authenticity. The constancy of Authenticity is Spirit. The constancy of Spirit is Origin. The constancy of Origin is Mystery. The constancy of Mystery is I. Thus abiding in constancy is called without beginning or end.\n\nIt cannot be seen, cannot be heard, cannot be grasped, cannot be possessed, cannot be Origin, cannot be Spirit, cannot be Authenticity, cannot be Dao. Entering the supreme, merging with the boundless—this is true Mystery. The worldly seek Dao through things, desiring it to be seen, heard, grasped, possessed, or not possessed. Those who seek Dao through principle desire it to be Origin, Spirit, Authenticity, or Dao. If Dao could be sought through seeing, hearing, Being, or Non-being, then Dao would be a thing. If Dao could be named as Origin, Authenticity, Spirit, or Dao, then Dao would be principle. The perfected person is not enslaved by things externally nor attached to principle internally. Thus without seeing, they see; without hearing, they hear; without grasping, they hold firm; without Being, they exist; without Non-being, they abide; without Origin, they are Origin; without Spirit, they are Spirit; without Authenticity, they are Authenticity; without Dao, they are Dao. Entering the supreme, merging with the boundless—all cannot be named, thus called true Mystery.",

      "translated_text": "**Chapter Three: One Hundred and Six Sayings**\n\nTrue Mystery is neither sound nor form, yet truly neither sound nor form. Above, it is not bright; below, it is not dim. Mystery is not shape, color, sound, or hearing—yet humans cannot fathom it. In the primordial beginning, embodying the Origin and entering Mystery, they gather dust-like forms and draw them in to form roots. Ears, eyes, nose, tongue, body, and mind divide the single essence of clarity. Inner thoughts scatter; outer senses interact. Hardness, warmth, movement, and activity drive the Four Great Elements and the six senses. As the Four Great Elements shift and connect, external dust turns delusive. If one could grasp the primordial beginning, realizing form and appearance as empty, and sever external dust, then color, fragrance, flavor, and touch would no longer cling to the roots. Seeing color would be as if blind; smelling fragrance, as if wind; tasting flavor, as if wax; feeling touch, as if empty. Once external dust dissolves, the six sense organs suddenly become pure. At the extreme of purity, Mystery unfolds—neither form nor sound. Seeing, hearing, awareness, and knowing arise beyond the senses. Thus, at its utmost height, it is vast yet not bright; at its utmost depth, it is subtle yet not dim. Vague and indistinct, obscure and profound—true Mystery, mysterious truth. Seeing yet not seeing, hearing yet not hearing. Each thing has its primordial beginning, unseen and unheard. Vague and obscure, yet not nothing.\n\nThus, the Buddhist scriptures say: *\"If one sees me in form or seeks me in sound, that person walks the deviant path and cannot see the Tathāgata.\"* The Daoist texts say: *\"That which cannot be seen, cannot be heard—transcending all extremes—is called the Mysterious Dao.\"* What is called Dao, if sought from without, is but a thing and not Dao. Why can humans not know Dao? Because they covet color and chase sound, turned by things. The primordial Mystery of the Origin—what is called unseen and unheard—when deluded, becomes seen and heard, turning away from the Origin.\n\nIn the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra*, the Buddha asked Ānanda: *\"Now observe carefully: from the palaces of the sun and moon to the Seven Golden Mountains, clouds rising, birds flying, wind stirring dust—all things near and far, though differing, are seen by your pure vision. If what you see are things, then you also see my seeing. If seeing the same is called seeing me, then I do not see. Why do you not see what I do not see? Where I do not see, you do not see. If the place is unseen, then it is naturally not a thing—how is it not yours? When you see, it is you, not me. The nature of seeing pervades all—who else but you? Thus, entering to see form, only I alone know it. Each knows their own seeing uniquely; none share the same vision. Therefore, what I see, others cannot see; what I hear, others cannot hear. If hearing the same is called hearing me, then I do not hear. Then they should know—since they do not know, what they hear is not what I hear.\"* Taste, touch, and awareness are likewise. As Zhuang Zhou said of *\"seeing the unique\"*—is this not it?\n\nThe Origin in the Great Mystery—still and silent, boundless and profound, serene and unnameable. All that can be named belongs to names and numbers—duality, not unity. Only the unnameable is Dao. As for Dao’s nearness to form, nothing surpasses Non-being, nothing surpasses Emptiness. Yet Non-being opposes Being, Emptiness opposes Substance—both fall into names and numbers, duality, not unity. Only the unnameable is One. What is called One is Non-being yet not Non-being, Being yet not Being, Emptiness yet not Emptiness, Substance yet not Substance. To the point of transcending Non-being, Being, Emptiness, and Substance—neither Non-being nor Being, neither Emptiness nor Substance—transcending yet not transcending, identical yet not identical. At its utmost, neither identity nor transcendence can be named—only then is it the Mysterious Dao.\n\nStillness is Non-being; boundlessness is eternity. Though Non-being, it is inexhaustibly so; though inexhaustible, still and silent, it cannot be possessed—this is called the Unnameable. Primordial Mystery, Spiritual Mystery, True Mystery, Dao Mystery; the emptiness of Heaven and Earth, the shared Mystery of yin and yang, the united Mystery of sun and moon, the contained Mystery of the Five Phases, the blended Mystery of the Eight Trigrams, the all-pervading Mystery of the myriad things. Things are not completed without Dao; truth is not established without Dao. Thus, the Origin attains Mystery and is Origin; Spirit attains Mystery and is Spirit; Truth attains Mystery and is Truth; Dao attains Mystery and is Dao—this is what is meant by *\"truth is not established without Dao.\"* Heaven and Earth attain Mystery and are formed; yin and yang attain Mystery and divide; sun and moon attain Mystery and shine; the Five Phases attain Mystery and mutually overcome and generate; the Eight Trigrams attain Mystery and mutually propel and agitate; the myriad things attain blended Mystery and live and die. Thus, *\"things are not completed without Dao.\"*\n\nUtterly empty, utterly still—I call it emptiness and stillness. The Mysterious Beginning is not Mystery—it cannot be grasped. The Mysterious Body is my Origin. Utter emptiness, extreme stillness. The utmost of emptiness does not empty Being and Non-being; the utmost of stillness does not still movement. If I say emptiness and stillness, then there is a mind for emptiness and stillness. Encountering Being, it is not empty; encountering movement, it is not still. The Mysterious Beginning is not Mystery—Mystery cannot be grasped. Only by embodying my Origin, knowing that Being and Non-being are not empty, knowing that movement is not unstilled—this is the Dao of the Origin.\n\n**Chapter Four: Sixty-Four Sayings**\n\nWho attains the Origin through the Origin? Who attains Spirit through Spirit? Who attains Truth through Truth? Who attains Dao through Dao? Who attains names through names? I boldly say: Mystery enters my Mystery. Knowing the Origin and guarding the Origin, the Origin is no longer Origin. Knowing Spirit and guarding Spirit, Spirit is no longer Spirit. Knowing Truth and guarding Truth, Truth is no longer Truth. Knowing Dao and guarding Dao, Dao is no longer Dao. Knowing knowledge and guarding knowledge—this is attachment.",

      "translated_text": "Knowing knowledge as no-knowledge—only then are the six penetrations achieved. The four unfoldings reside in Origin; it is not that Origin resides in Spirit, nor that Spirit resides in Truth, nor that Truth resides in Dao. Dao is not named; names are not forced—this is called: subtly as the elusive, subtly entering my subtlety. Only then is it united as Origin, dispersed as Spirit, concentrated as One into Truth, transformed myriadly as Dao. Rising with the pure and descending with the turbid, arraying essence and soul, the Dao of transformation exhausts images and extremes of form, returning to subtlety. Origin takes subtlety as its body; thus Origin is the union of subtlety, Spirit is the dispersion of subtlety, Truth is the oneness of subtlety, and Dao is the transformation of subtlety. Down to the division of yin and yang, the descent of the turbid and ascent of the pure, the arraying of essence and soul—all things are completed, all issuing from subtlety. First emerging from subtlety, exhausting its transformations, grasses and trees, insects, water and fire, earth and wood—exhausting images and extremes of form—all are my subtlety. Things spontaneously follow to be born; Dao spontaneously returns to be completed. If one can return from images and forms to their source, all can attain subtlety.\n\n**Chapter Five: Ninety-Eight Sayings**\n\nI begin with subtlety—myriad spirits are not spirit, myriad dharmas are not named, myriad realms are not born. Not that they are not spirit—subtle spirit has no illumination. Not that they are not named—subtle dharma has no cause. Not that they are not born—subtle realm has no condition. Subtlety upon subtlety has no opposite—this is called independence. Why is subtle spirit without spirit? Because spirit has no direction. Why is subtle dharma without name? Because dharma has no dharma. Why is subtle realm without existence? Because it has no condition. The subtlety of the Origin is profoundly still and self-illuminating; without illumination, there is no illuminator, no dharma, no name. Detached from all arising and ceasing, causes do not produce effects; since causes do not produce, conditions have no counterpart. Thus all dusts and images cannot be completed—purely through subtle clarity. Subtlety upon subtlety has no opposite—this is called independence. Neither child nor grandchild, it is one with non-solitude. Flowing in and out endlessly, it is one with no gate. Myriad things return to Origin, yet its governance is unseen. Neither child nor grandchild, its transmission is inexhaustible—thus it is not solitary. Flowing in and out endlessly, its bounds are unknown—thus it has no gate. Though it governs myriad things, and myriad things return to it, none see how it governs. I begin with subtlety—still, vast, continuous, profound, expansive—I know not its arising. Thus it is called: the Dao of long life. Where there is birth, there is death; only where there is no birth is there long life. The subtlety of the Origin does not arise from arising—thus I know not its arising. Only stillness is seen as vast, continuity as enduring, profundity as abiding, expansiveness as boundless. Thus it is named: the Dao of long life.\n\n**Chapter Six: One Hundred and Sixty Sayings**\n\nThe spontaneous is not subtlety; subtlety is not the spontaneous—I originate from subtlety. Above, it is not bright—dimly, vaguely; below, it is not dark—vaguely, dimly. Dim and vague, obscure and indistinct, above and below are one in subtlety. Subtle dimness, subtle vagueness—neither image nor thing. The spontaneous can be named Dao, yet Dao is not the spontaneous. Why? The spontaneous has a fixed body, while Dao has no fixed body. If Dao were taken as the spontaneous, then Dao should not descend to generate things. If things were taken as the spontaneous, then things should not transform to become Dao. Thus it is said: the spontaneous is not subtlety; subtlety is not the spontaneous. The subtlety of the Origin dwells between being and non-being. Dimness is brightness, being; vagueness is extinction, non-being. At the extreme of subtlety, its greatness is not seen as bright—having emerged into being, yet still and non-being—thus it is called dimly, vaguely. At its smallest, its darkness is not seen—dwelling in non-being, yet emerging into being—thus it is called vaguely, dimly. Dim and vague, obscure and indistinct, emerging and entering between being and non-being, above and below alike in subtlety—thus it is called subtle dimness, subtle vagueness, neither image nor thing. I begin with Origin—subtly vague, subtly dim, neither thing nor image. I begin with Spirit—profoundly obscure, profoundly dark, neither subtlety nor form. I begin with Truth—darkly obscure, obscurely profound, neither form nor subtlety. I begin with Dao—essence contains truth, the spontaneous Dao. Origin, Spirit, and Truth are divisions of subtlety, yet do not exhaust its body—all are neither thing nor image, dwelling between dimness, vagueness, obscurity, and darkness. As for Dao, only then is there essence, only then is there truth—neither obscure nor dark, neither dim nor vague—yet still not detached from the spontaneous. Descending from Dao, essence disperses into form, truth descends into things—things arise, and Dao’s spontaneity is lost. Dao follows the spontaneous; the spontaneous is the true Dao. \"True\" is the designation of the spontaneous. The five mouths know not its spontaneity. The spontaneous is true; truth is the Dao of the spontaneous. Thus it is said: Dao follows the spontaneous. The so-called spontaneity of Dao and the spontaneity of things share the same name but differ in meaning. What the world calls spontaneous is a term for non-change. When deluded and without wisdom, clinging to the existence of things as spontaneous, failing to discern the original body of the spontaneous—then this spontaneity deeply obstructs Dao, and the sage rejects it. This is the intent behind the opening lines: the spontaneous is not subtlety; subtlety is not the spontaneous. The so-called spontaneity of Dao is that when Dao descends to become things, its self remains unchanging—this is the spontaneity of Dao. What the world calls spontaneous is the self of things, such as the whiteness of swans or the blackness of crows. Lacking knowledge, they take black and white as the self of crows and swans, not knowing why swans are white or crows are black. There is also that which makes them so—this is not self. Since the world takes the non-self as self and the non-so as so, the sage avoids such terms.",

      "translated_text": "Though the sage has mastered the subtleties of Dao and understands the nature of spontaneity, when discoursing on Dao, they still say, \"I do not know its spontaneity.\" For to claim knowledge of it is to impose spontaneity upon it—this is no longer spontaneity. How much less can those who rely on worldly sentiments, deluded thoughts, and speculative conjectures fathom it?\n\nThe true follows the numinous, the numinous follows the origin, the origin follows the subtle. The subtle has no method, and thus it is the source of the myriad methods. Without method as method, without origin as origin, without numinous as numinous, without true as true, without Dao as Dao, without nothingness as nothingness, without being as being—this is my utmost subtlety, entering the subtlety of the primordial origin. If there is something to follow, then there is something not yet attained. Thus, the true cannot but follow the numinous, the numinous cannot but follow the origin, and the origin cannot but follow the subtle. Only when one reaches the utmost subtlety is there no method to follow. Precisely because it has no method, it is the source of the myriad things. As such, there is no method, no origin, no numinous, no true, no Dao, no nothingness, no being. Only those who embody subtlety can attain this. Thus, the *Dharmapada* of the *Śākya Transmission* states:\n\n*The Dharma is originally Dharma without Dharma,\nWithout Dharma, Dharma is still Dharma.\nNow, when no-Dharma is transmitted,\nWhat Dharma has ever been Dharma?*\n\n**Chapter Seven, One Hundred and Twenty Characters**\n\nThe utmost subtlety is without interval, without beginning, without limit, without end, without bounds, without center.\nWithout interval yet not without interval, without beginning yet not without beginning, without limit yet not without limit, without end yet not without end, without bounds yet not without bounds, without center yet not without center.\nWithout interval—one does not see its severance.\nWithout beginning—one does not see its precedence.\nWithout limit—one does not see its above.\nWithout end—one does not see its conclusion.\nWithout bounds—one does not see its edge.\nWithout center—one does not see its expanse.\n\nThough without interval, continuity and discontinuity are insufficient to name Dao, thus there is also no \"without interval.\"\nThough without beginning, before and after are insufficient to name Dao, thus there is also no \"without beginning.\"\nThough without limit, above and below are insufficient to name Dao, thus there is also no \"without limit.\"\nThough without end, beginning and end are insufficient to name Dao, thus there is also no \"without end.\"\nThough without bounds, edge and center are insufficient to name Dao, thus there is also no \"without bounds.\"\nThough without center, expanse and narrowness are insufficient to name Dao, thus there is also no \"without center.\"\nExhausting all the world’s words is still insufficient to name Dao, thus the Great Dao is nameless.\n\nMy beginning is without center—being and nothingness are one body.\nMy beginning is without bounds—it merges with the primordial subtle.\nHeaven and earth, the six directions—great and small are one subtlety.\nThe subtle roams through great and small—who can perceive its essence?\n\nThe so-called \"without center\" is not merely emptiness without bounds; it must have being and nothingness as one body, void and full mutually pervading—only then is it without center.\nThe so-called \"without bounds\" is not merely boundless vastness; it must merge with the primordial subtle, great and small as one—only then is it without bounds.\nThus, vast as heaven and earth, expansive as the six directions, immense as the void, minute as a speck of dust—all are one subtlety. Therefore, the subtle roams in and out of heaven and earth, rests within a speck of dust, circulates through the void, upholds the six directions—who knows its essence, who exhausts its subtlety?\n\nI say: without form, without sound, without name.\nMy beginning is subtle, my middle is subtle—the subtlety of the three nones.\nMy primordial origin is the utmost Dao—this is called ultimate bliss.\nThe vessel of subtle roaming contains and embraces, accompanying heaven, earth, and the myriad things to their end, yet it is inexhaustible in its extremity.\nBecause it does not take form as form, it is without form; because it does not take sound as sound, it is without sound; because it does not take name as name, it is without name.\nThe subtle enters without sequence, yet the subtle has sequence—thus there is the subtlety of the beginning, the subtlety of the middle, and the utmost subtlety of the three nones. This is the primordial origin, the utmost Dao, ultimate bliss.\nThe subtle roaming is all-embracing, all-containing, accompanying heaven, earth, and the myriad things to their end.

      "translated_text": "**Scroll Two, Chapter of One Thousand Words – First Section (159 characters)**\n\nSubtle and origin intermingle, numinous and origin merge as one, true and origin unite, Dao and origin return to the source, virtue and origin revert to subtlety—thus do things return to their root.\nSubtlety, origin, numinous, true, and Dao—each possesses depths and shallows, marking the measure of those who cultivate the Way.\nThis origin’s subtlety is not the subtlety of subtlety.\nThis origin’s numinous is not the numinous of subtlety.\nThis origin’s true is not the true of subtlety.\nThis origin’s Dao is not the Dao of subtlety.\nThis origin’s virtue is not the virtue of subtlety.\nThe multitude scatter their virtue and become things; the perfected person returns virtue to subtlety. Dao returns to things, things return to Dao—thus it is said: following it, one becomes human; reversing it, one attains Dao.\n\nOrigin is not origin—it precedes form.\nForm is not form—it coalesces in undifferentiated oneness.\nSubtle-origin is indistinct and vague, suddenly manifesting as image.\nSubtle-origin is vague and indistinct, suddenly manifesting as thing.\nThings and images emerge from profound obscurity, suddenly bearing essence.\nEssence contains the numinous, the numinous unites as the true.\nThis is not the color of color—pristine simplicity holds luminosity.\nThis is not the form of form, not the image of image.\nWhat makes origin *origin* is not origin—it is the beginning of subtle form.\nWhat makes form *form* is not form—it coalesces in undifferentiated oneness.\nDao descends from subtlety to origin, first assuming indistinct and vague appearances. Thus it is said: subtle-origin is indistinct and vague, suddenly manifesting as image; subtle-origin is vague and indistinct, suddenly manifesting as thing.\nThings and images arise from profound obscurity, yet within them abides the purest essence.\nEssence gathers as the numinous, the numinous unites as the true—this is the essence of origin.\nThus its essence possesses luminosity and color, image and form. This color and luminosity, form and image, reside within our primordial, uncontrived nature.\nYet with the slightest stirring of the mind, one grasps at dust-like images. Dust accumulates into roots, and the original image and luminosity are lost.\nThe perfected person transcends the roots of perception and restores primordial luminosity.\nThus they perceive not the color of color—pristine simplicity holds luminosity; not the form of form, not the image of image.\n\nThe great image of origin is vast and boundless, its radiance profound.\nThe harmony of origin resounds—only origin alone hears it.\nThe form of origin’s image—only origin alone sees it.\nThe image of origin is not the image of things. Its vast and profound radiance cannot be glimpsed by things. Thus the harmony of origin is heard only by origin alone; the form of origin’s image is seen only by origin alone.\n\nThe origin of origin is the true ancestor, the true mother.\nThe emperor precedes the beginning of Dao; the origin is the primal record of images.\nI begin with origin-origin, originating from the primal record, returning to my beginning—I do not see myself.\nWho declares my origin as the primordial beginning? This is called the beginning and end, the origin of the primal record.\nSubtlety cannot be seen, but in the primordial beginning, there are gradual signs of visibility. Thus the origin of origin is called the true ancestor, the true mother.\nThe emperor precedes the beginning of Dao; at the inception of images, the record of Dao first reveals a trace.\nThus I begin with origin, gradually assuming a recordable form.\nThough gradually recordable, I return to the beginning.\nI do not even know my own beginning—how much less others?\nThis is called the origin of the primal record of beginning and end.\nTo speak of beginning and end: Dao in its origin has the name of beginning.\nThings end and are exhausted.\nThe origin of the primal record begins with origin and ends with origin—origin-origin is inexhaustible.\nWithout beginning or end—this is the origin of the primal record.\n\n**Second Section (114 characters)**\n\nOrigin-origin is the womb-light, the beginning of the nine origins, preceding the eight trigrams.\nWomb-light is the primal origin—bright, radiant, indistinct, vague.\nOrigin-origin’s primal light gives rise to true being.\nThe perfected person emerges from subtlety into origin, gradually revealing signs of light.\nOf humanity’s three souls, one is womb-light—thus origin-origin is womb-light.\nAll numbers end at nine; ten reverts to one.\nThus the great number culminates at nine, and all nine numbers arise from origin—hence the nine origins.\nThe beginning of the nine origins is the one.\nPreceding the eight trigrams, Qian and Kun are the ancestors of yin and yang. In the *Book of Changes*, this is the Supreme Ultimate; in Qian, it is origin; in humanity, it is womb-light.\nWomb-light is the primal origin—bright, radiant, indistinct, vague—all referring to the primal light of origin.\nThings, from their inception in light, lose the root of Dao. Thus Buddhist texts call it \"primal luminosity\"—hence *primal luminosity*.\nIlluminating the place of arising, the place of arising establishes illumination. When nature perishes—if the perfected person begins with the subtlety of non-being and emerges into the subtlety of being, then from subtlety descending, the coarse Dao arises from origin, while subtlety remains numinous—this is their difference.\nThus it is said: subtlety gives birth to true being.\n\nOrigin reveals, origin conceals—the great image within the millet-pearl.\nOrigin arises, origin vanishes—the great thing within the millet-pearl.\nOrigin, through the great image, contains all images.\nOrigin, through the great thing, encompasses all things.\nWhen things attain form, they cannot enter the minute with the vast or conceal the vast within the minute.\nOrigin, rooted in nature and not yet entering form, can reveal or conceal—like the dreaming soul wandering within the body, where mountains, rivers, and the great earth are all present, and all beings and affairs are manifest.\nIf one meets through form, two millets cannot contain each other.\nIf one meets through nature, the great image within the millet-pearl is no marvel.\nFor the great image is not image—thus it contains all images.\nThe great thing is not thing—thus it encompasses all things.\nThe sage, having expounded this principle, occasionally reveals its traces to awaken future generations.\nThey seek to dispel the ignorance of those who cling to coarse forms, yet when extraordinary transformations are witnessed, some dismiss them as deceptive illusions.\nThis is why the followers of the Buddha distance themselves from worldly discourse—is this not the reason?",

      "translated_text": "**Primordial Clear and Primordial Turbid—so too are yin and yang.**\nThe Primordial is where clear and turbid first intermingle, yet yin and yang remain undivided, coalescing as one primordial unity. As the *Yi* says: \"One yin, one yang—this is called the Dao.\" \"One yin, one yang\" refers precisely to the state before yin and yang separate. From this undivided yin-yang arises goodness; from goodness, then, arises nature. Only when nature is established do things take form. Never has there been a world where nature was unformed yet goodness already complete. Thus, what the *Yi* calls the Dao and what it calls goodness both precede things—they are not terms for good and evil.\n\nWhen clear and turbid intermingle and yin and yang share a single primordial source, they are neither clear nor turbid, neither yin nor yang. They merge through nature, not through form. Thus, primordial clear contains turbid; primordial turbid contains clear; primordial yang contains yin; primordial yin contains yang—like water and fire that do not repel each other. Clear and turbid share a single source; yin and yang arise together. Who can name them?\n\nMarvelous images and primordial images, marvelous sounds and primordial sounds—sounds and images cannot encompass the root of the myriad things, the spirit of the myriad things. What I call \"one\" is not one, yet one remains unmanifest. What I call \"primordial\" is not yet primordial, yet the primordial is not yet constant. Marvelous images and marvelous sounds—only the solitary listener may hear them; only the solitary seer may see them. Their sounds and images are not images—what people may see or hear. Thus they are the root of the myriad things, the spirit of the myriad things, for in their primordial state they are called the beginning of numbers, the ancestor of the One. Yet in truth, they remain unmanifest; the One is not yet visible. They are called the beginning of form, the ancestor of constancy. Yet their form is unseen, and constancy is not yet constant.\n\nThe sage embodies this and calls it the Nameless. The Primordial One contains the marvelous; the marvelous Primordial flows with radiance. Flowing radiance contains qi; this is the constancy of the Primordial Marvelous. I say: the Dao of primordial constancy models itself on primordial constancy.\n\nQi, form, and number—these three reside within marvelous being. They are neither being nor non-being. Flowing radiance becomes qi; qi congeals into form; form appears as number. The perfected ones of antiquity embodied marvelous non-being and emerged as marvelous being. How could these three ever be absent? Yet in the end, they are not being. For the qi of flowing radiance is not stirred by yin and yang; the form of marvelous qi is not fabricated by artificial combination; the number revealed in form cannot be sought in one or two.\n\nThus, entering, it becomes the Great Void; emerging, it becomes marvelous being. Dispersing form and scattering qi into a thousand myriad shapes does not make it excessive. Gathering its luminous trace and absorbing its radiance, closing and concealing its form, does not make it deficient. This is called the constancy of the Primordial Marvelous. The Dao models itself on primordial constancy—thus it cannot be questioned.\n\n**Chapter Five: One Hundred Sixty-Six Words**\n\nThe marvelousness of yin and yang, the profundity of clear and turbid—profound and marvelous give rise to the Primordial through mutual dependence. Yin and yang sharing a single source is called the marvelous; clear and turbid containing each other is called the profound. Yin and yang unite through qi; clear and turbid merge through form. Marvelous qi is as if without qi; marvelous form is as if without form. Thus it is said: the profound and the marvelous give rise to one another.\n\nThe Primordial contains the myriad images; the myriad images contain the Primordial. The myriad images give birth to the Primordial Primordial; the Primordial Primordial gives birth to the myriad images. The Primordial contains the myriad images, yet it is not form. The myriad images arise from the Primordial, yet they are not things.\n\nThe perfected ones of antiquity turned inward and attained sincerity—then the myriad things were all complete within them. By attaining the Center and Harmony, they stood with Heaven and Earth and nurtured the myriad things, all within their own Center and Harmony. The Buddhists speak of the \"mind-made body\"—the body arises following the mind, not through artificial fabrication. This is like the Daoists' \"eight radiant luminances of the spirit-light,\" where the myriad spirits intermingle and arise as the mind wills, swift and unhindered, even to the point of generating entire species, with nothing lacking and beyond reckoning. This is what is meant by the Primordial Primordial giving birth to the myriad images.\n\nThe spirit does not know the spirit; the true does not know the true; the Dao does not know the Dao. I originate from the Void and Non-being. The Dao is hidden, without name; the true is hidden, without form; the spirit is hidden, without numinosity. My spirit is luminous and numinous; my true is profound and refined. The spirit is hidden, without numinosity—yet without numinosity, it attains the utmost spirit. The true is hidden, without form—yet without form, it attains the utmost true. The Dao is hidden, without name—yet without name, it attains the utmost Dao. The Three Absences merge into the Primordial.\n\nThe marvelousness of the Primordial lies in the spirit hidden without numinosity, the true hidden without form, the Dao hidden without name. Thus, without numinosity is the true spirit; without form is the true true; without name is the true Dao. Therefore, it is said: the Three Absences are the Primordial.\n\nThe unfolding of these five chapters is not an arbitrary ordering by the sage. The marvelous, in the Dao, is the ultimate of sageliness; in humans, it is the beginning of the hun-soul. It is neither image nor thing, neither dying nor living—this is my original beginning, what is called the marvelous. The Primordial follows the marvelous; in humans, it is the fetal radiance. The spirit follows the Primordial; in humans, it is the luminous numen. The true follows the spirit; in humans, it is the profound essence.\n\nBelow this lies the Dao. From the Dao downward, nature is formed and shape is complete. Thus, the three hun-souls of humans—first, the fetal radiance; second, the luminous numen; third, the profound essence—derive their meaning from this. As the *Yi* says: \"Essence-qi becomes things; the wandering hun-soul becomes transformation.\" When essence-qi becomes things, substance is complete and the body is formed. With formation comes decay; things cannot be enduring. Only the hun-soul wanders among things—when things decay, the hun-soul does not perish. Thus the *Yi* calls it transformation.\n\nThe sages of antiquity deeply and clearly expounded this to instruct people. Thus, the marvelous lies above the hun-soul, while the Dao lies below it. The marvelous precedes the hun-soul; the Dao descends from it. Below the Dao, the sage does not dwell. Above the Dao, the multitude does not reside.\n\nThe reason the multitude is born and dies, dies and is born, is that the Dao descends into the po-soul, and when the po-soul flourishes, the hun-soul wanes. The sage’s hun-soul flourishes while the po-soul vanishes—thus they wander together with the Dao.",

      "translated_text": "The multitude’s po-soul flourishes while the hun-soul perishes—thus they perish together with things. From this perspective, the so-called \"three hun-souls\" are precisely this primordial spirit, true and authentic. The \"seven po-souls\" are joy, anger, sorrow, fear, love, aversion, and desire. When the hun-soul is whole, one becomes an immortal; when the po-soul is whole, one becomes a ghost. When hun-soul and po-soul stand in balance, one becomes human. This is the natural principle, and even if the sages were to rise again, they would not alter my words.\n\nThough the sage embodies the hun-soul and the multitude embodies the po-soul, this is spoken of only after their formation. As for the primordial beginning, when hun-soul and po-soul were undivided and the clear and turbid had not yet separated, who could distinguish which was hun and which was po? Once divided, wholeness becomes hun, dispersion becomes po; ascent becomes hun, descent becomes po; uprightness becomes hun, perversion becomes po; truth becomes hun, falsehood becomes po. Their root is the same, but their ends differ—thus the po-soul is also the hun-soul, and the hun-soul is also the po-soul. When the po-soul dissolves, it becomes hun; when the hun-soul dissolves, it becomes po. What the Buddhists call \"ignorance is Buddha-nature\" refers precisely to this.\n\nMy primordial Dao of the primordial beginning revolves in ineffable mystery, yet this mystery cannot be grasped. Naturally primordial and wondrous, it ascends and descends, revolving of itself—I begin from the primordial of the primordial. I know not its natural primordial Dao and primordial virtue. Who can embody my primordial Dao and primordial virtue, returning to my primordial beginning? This is the Way of returning to the origin and reverting to the root, fully realized.\n\nThe sage embodies the Dao of the primordial beginning, revolving among things, concealing marvelousness within form and traces. Harmonizing its light, blending with the dust, it cannot be said to lack marvelousness, nor can marvelousness be ascribed to it. It dwells within form and traces, yet even form and traces are marvelous—thus its marvelousness cannot be grasped. Ascending and descending, revolving through worldly affairs, naturally primordial and wondrous, yet its subtlety is unseen. For my original essence is the primordial body of the primordial beginning, and I respond naturally to things, yet I know not this naturalness. Thus not only does the primordial Dao transform into marvelousness, but primordial virtue also transforms into marvelousness. From the vast to the minute, from the heart to its traces, all is marvelous—who can comprehend it? Therefore, though I embody the Dao and virtue to transcend the world, I return them to the primordial beginning. This is the Way of returning to the origin and reverting to the root, fully realized.\n\n**Chapter Six (One Hundred Forty-Eight Characters)**\n\nThe primordial generates spirit; spirit generates the primordial.\nThe primordial descends to become spirit; spirit unites to become the primordial.\nSpirit is numinous through the primordial; the primordial is manifest through spirit.\nThus above and below generate one another.\n\nMy primordial essence is pure; the primordial One revolves and generates. Before primordial colors unfold, there is only dim obscurity. Azure, white, vermilion, and yellow-green contain the four images, and the four images hold light. Azure, white, vermilion, and yellow-green form the four images—here, the profound is not spoken of. The profound is the mother of colors; colorlessness is the profound. Before primordial colors unfold, their light is profoundly dark. The primordial One is what is called the profound.\n\nFrom the primordial One revolving, the five primordials are born—thus Heaven’s One becomes water. Heaven generates water within, water floats Heaven and bears Earth. Before the primordial unfolds, within the great profound, there naturally exists the light of azure, white, vermilion, and yellow-green, uniting to form the four images and five primordials in dim obscurity.\n\nMy marvelousness of the primordial beginning employs the primordial One, yet is not the primordial One—it is the marvelousness of the primordial One. Marvelousness generates the primordial; the primordial generates marvelousness. Marvelousness is the ancestor of the primordial; the primordial is the function of marvelousness. From marvelousness entering the primordial, it is called the primordial One. The function of the primordial One is the mutual generation of primordial and marvelousness—one knows not marvelousness as primordial, nor primordial as marvelousness.\n\nAzure and white alternate in concealment and revelation, left and right mutually primordial. Primordial light is dim and obscure; the primordial emerges and enters, emerging and entering without gate—I know not its primordial. Vermilion and profound ascend and descend, neither bright nor dark. Above and below are one primordial, the primordial following nature.\n\nAzure is the qi-color of wood in the East; white is the qi-color of metal in the West. Wood is left, metal is right—thus it is said left and right are mutually primordial. Vermilion is the qi-color of fire in the South; profound is the qi-color of water in the North. Fire ascends, water descends—thus it is said vermilion and profound ascend and descend. Primordial light is dim and obscure; in the East and West, azure and white emerge and enter, yet their gate is unseen. In the South and North, profound and vermilion ascend and descend, yet their brightness and obscurity are unapparent. There is emergence and entry without visible emergence or entry, brightness and obscurity without visible brightness or obscurity—thus the spirit’s function has no gate, and the Dao follows nature.\n\nNon-action is natural; naturalness is non-action. The Dao precedes dim obscurity; the primordial precedes primordial non-action—who can embody my non-action and naturalness? The primordial arises from non-action; non-action arises from the primordial. From the primordial, naturalness is born—I know not how this is so.\n\nMy primordial beginning is the Heaven of non-action. In the Heaven of non-action, there is azure yet not wood, white yet not metal, vermilion yet not fire, profound yet not water, yellow-green yet not earth.

All things must possess the reckoning of being and non-being, the positions of above and below, the distinctions of left and right, the boundaries of inner and outer.

Supreme wondrousness gives rise to the wondrous; the wondrous arises from the wondrous—such is the Dao of self-arising. I have said that the wondrous arising of the Primordial cannot be exhausted, nor can its beginning be found; I can only know its completion.\n\nFrom the wondrous Primordial descending to give rise to spirit—I know not the arising of spirit. For guarding the wondrous body, the Primordial-spirit arises of itself. I know not its arising—this is called supreme arising. Supreme arising: spirit arises from the wondrous, its arising inexhaustible. Being inexhaustible, its beginning cannot be found. Without finding its beginning, its end is not seen. Though its end is not seen, the supreme wondrous bestows and returns to stillness, reverting to wondrous being—yet what appears as an end is not truly an end. I can know its completion; knowing its completion, I may cause it to arise again.\n\nLeft moves, left responds—I am not in the left. Right moves, right responds—I am not in the right. Exhaling brings forth—I am not outside. Inhaling draws in—I am not inside. When I first respond, I have already lost myself. My response abides in the root of the great square—thus it is without direction. My transformation stands at the head of the great image—thus it is without form.\n\nLeft moves, left responds, yet I am not in the left; right moves, right responds, yet I am not in the right—then movement is not mine, nor is response. Exhaling brings forth, yet I know not my own exhalation. Inhaling draws in, yet I know not my own inhalation. For I am omnipresent. As the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* says: the true fire of emptiness pervades the Dharma realm. Like holding a burning mirror to seek fire from the sun—where the mirror is held, fire arises; if held throughout the world, fire arises throughout the world.\n\nPeople surely know there is left and right, exhalation and inhalation, yet they know not that it is omnipresent. It would seem there is no response, no movement, no exhalation, no inhalation. If even a trace of intention to respond arises, one is enslaved by things without respite—how then could one know the self as self? Only by abiding in the great square to respond to movement does its movement lack direction. Only by standing in formlessness to respond to change does its image lack form.\n\nWithout direction externally, without form internally—if not the most spirit-like under heaven, who could attain this? I constantly transform, yet I know not this transformation. I first unite within the Primordial, then threefold transform into the true. With me as one, one is not one. My employment and non-employment—I know not its movement or stillness. Spirit beyond spirit.\n\nSpirit arises from the wondrous Primordial like clouds emerging from mountains. In an instant, myriad transformations arise, yet the clouds know not themselves. My embodiment in the wondrous: first transformed in the Primordial, then in spirit, then in the true. Though threefold transformed, it is never not one. One is also three, three is also one. Employment and non-employment—all are transformation. Thus, movement is spirit, stillness is spirit—spirit beyond spirit.\n\n**Second Chapter: Thirty-Three Words**\nWondrous Primordial, spirit, one, seven, nine, three—yin and yang, heaven and earth, sun and moon, earth, wood, fire, metal, water. One, two, three; one, two, three; one, two, three—spirit abides in the Primordial of non-being.\n\nThe supremely wondrous touches upon images, the supremely spirit-like touches upon numbers. Thus, the Primordial Scroll speaks of the azure, white, vermilion, and yellow images; the Spirit Scroll speaks of the numbers one, seven, nine, three. Measured against the *River Chart*: one is below, nine above, three to the left, seven to the right. Verified by celestial numbers: the beginning azure obtains nine yang as wood; the cinnabar radiance obtains three yang as fire; the white numen obtains seven yang as metal; the dark above obtains one yang as water—all are the numbers one, seven, nine, three, distributed among the four directions.\n\nIn yin and yang, they are the numbers of qi; in heaven and earth, the numbers of movement; in sun and moon, the numbers of conjunction; in the Five Phases, the numbers of function. *Zhuangzi* says: \"The Dao and one make two, two and one make three. Beyond this, even the most skillful reckoner cannot know their number.\" From non-being to being, it reaches three—how much more from being to being?",

      "translated_text": "If we follow *Zhuangzi*'s reasoning, then from the name of \"being wondrous\" (妙), the three are already complete—how much more from the wondrous to the primordial (元), from the primordial to the numinous (神), where even the most skillful reckoner cannot calculate. Thus, from one to two, from two to three, and three again and again, reaching an incalculable multitude. Though the numinous disperses, its thousands and myriads enter into number yet transcend number. Hence it is said: the primordial of non-being (无无之元) is called \"one,\" yet even one cannot be attained—how much less three?\n\n**Chapter Three** (102 words)\nHeaven and earth unite through the primordial; yin and yang conjoin through the primordial; sun and moon embrace through the primordial. The three primordials merge into non-being, and the ten thousand images are without existence—this is called the *primordial root* (元根). The primordial root arises from non-being: heaven and earth do not unite without the primordial; yin and yang do not conjoin without the primordial; sun and moon do not shine without the primordial. \"Embrace\" means containing the primordial and manifesting luminosity. My primordial begins at the inception, as the numen’s spirit (神之灵). The numen arises from emptiness and non-being (虚无), empty yet inexhaustible. I call it the *Great Primordial’s Numen* (太元之神): at the inception, who can empty it? From non-being the numen is born—inception, numen, inception, wondrous. When my one first arises, the wondrous is empty emptiness (妙无虚虚). The numen is born within the wondrous non-being of the primordial inception, empty yet inexhaustible, moving yet ever emerging—all is its natural, uncontrived state. Thus, the Great Primordial’s Numen: at the inception, who can empty it? To speak of emptiness is not to claim it can be fabricated. It arises from utmost non-being, and the utmost numinous is only the inception’s numen, united with the inception’s wondrousness, merging into supreme function. Hence it is said: \"When my one first arises, though the numen is born, the wondrous is empty emptiness.\" *Primordial emptiness* (元虚) is the true emptiness of the Great Primordial. *Great One* (太一), following its primordial inception, the Great One’s being and non-being, the numen unites with the Great Void (太虚). The Great Void is the primordial’s primordial numen (元元之神), entering and exiting the wondrous primordial (妙元). The primordial of primordial emptiness is true emptiness. Though the Great One also follows the primordial inception, the Great One’s wondrous being and wondrous non-being must unite with the emptiness of primordial emptiness to attain perfection. Thus, the Great Void is the primordial’s primordial numen: when the numen is whole, there is exit and entry. Though there is exit and entry, its traces do not adhere—hence it is called *wondrous primordial*.\n\n**Chapter Four** (8 words)\nHeaven and earth give birth to the numen; the numen gives birth to heaven and earth.\n\n**Chapter Five** (144 words)\nThe numen is the primordial one (元一) of primordial emptiness and primordial fullness. The one conceals primordial emptiness, and the numen becomes evanescent (恍惚). If the one-numen does not cease, the evanescent cannot grasp the numen. The true arises from the evanescent, blending indistinguishably into the obscure (杳冥). My one is not seen; my numen is not heard—the numen merges with primordial emptiness. Beginning as emptiness, it gradually becomes full. The numen in emptiness does not increase; the numen in fullness does not decrease. Hence it is said: the numen is the primordial one. This one, concealed in primordial emptiness, is the wondrousness of the evanescent. If the numen does not congeal, then the evanescent cannot grasp the numen. The true inception congeals within the Great Void, evanescent and indistinct, blending into the obscure. Though there is one, things do not see it; though there is numen, things do not hear it—yet my one never ceases to be one, my numen never ceases to be numen. Hence it is said: the numen merges with primordial emptiness. This \"merging\" is what the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* calls \"seeing yet transcending seeing, where seeing cannot reach.\" The inception’s utmost Dao, the utmost Dao’s empty numen, is the stabilization of the Great One’s inception. Uniting numen and wondrousness, primordial inception and wondrous inception, wondrous inception and primordial inception—my primordial numen’s primordial cannot be grasped; the numen cannot be unified. The Dao of transformation, the function of numinous clarity, establishes the foundation and sets the omen, engendering and transforming wondrously. The utmost Dao gathers the foundation of emptiness and the numen; when stabilized at the inception of stabilization and extremity, the myriad numina naturally assemble. Assembling yet unaware of assembling, transforming the one into the myriad, uniting wondrousness and numen—this wondrousness is natural, all my primordial inception. The function of wondrous inception seeks the numen’s primordial, yet the primordial cannot be grasped. If there were grasping and primordial, the numen would be a thing—no longer the numen. Precisely because there is no grasping, the numen cannot be unified. Its ten thousand transformations are inexhaustible in function. With the wondrous, it establishes the foundation and sets the omen: the wondrous gives birth to the numen, and the numen numinously begets one another. Hence it is said: engendering and transforming wondrously. At first, when my one transforms into three, it unites with the numen-primordial (神元). The inception’s numen numinously transforms and wondrously responds; wondrous response transforms and changes—the numen’s natural state. Things do not know the numen; naturally, the numen is numinous. Wondrousness unites with the primordial; the primordial unites with the numen—this is called \"one transforming into three,\" uniting with the numen-primordial. This is my inception’s central numen: the numen transforms itself, transforming to respond to things, wondrously responding and wondrously transforming—the numen’s natural state, the natural’s numen, numinous and numinous. The *Book of Changes* says: \"Without thought, without action, still and unmoving, yet when stimulated, it penetrates all things under heaven. If not the utmost numen under heaven, who could achieve this?\" If inwardly there is no thought, the heart does not know the heart; if outwardly there is no action, the body does not know the body. Inwardly not seeing the heart, outwardly not seeing the body—then it is still and unmoving. Stillness responds and penetrates, then without the heart knowing, without the body acting, without thought yet nothing unknown, without action yet nothing undone—this is called penetrating all things under heaven. \"Hence\" refers to traces. And the traces of all under heaven cannot escape. This is what is meant by wondrous transformation and wondrous response. If not the utmost numen under heaven, who could achieve this?\n\n**Chapter Six** (134 words)\nOne numen wondrous, one numen primordial; wondrous numen, primordial numen; moving numen, still numen; exiting numen, entering numen; having numen, lacking numen; yin numen, yang numen; seeing numen, hearing numen; evanescent numen, indistinct numen; left numen, right numen; one numen, myriad numina—numinous, numinous!

      "translated_text": "The numen unites with the wondrous, the numen unites with the primordial; the primordial is also numen, the wondrous is also numen. Thus, in movement and stillness, exit and entry, presence and absence, yin and yang, seeing and hearing, evanescence and indistinctness, left and right, the one and the myriad—none do not arise from the numen’s transformations. Numinous, numinous! The numen does not know its own numinosity.\n\nOur primordial numen follows the Dao of the numen, and only then is the numen known. The numen is wondrous in a single thing, and even ghosts and spirits cannot grasp its numinosity. The Dao is graded by the measure of what is realized: the higher can encompass the lower, but the lower cannot know the higher. Only when one is born of this can one know what is ours.\n\nThus, only through the numen can the numen be known, as in the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra*’s eighteen heavens of the form realm, among which are the five heavens of no-return. Those in the four dhyānas of the form realm merely hear with reverence but cannot perceive. Therefore, among heavenly and human beings, only the six heavens of the desire realm and the thirteen heavens of the form realm’s four dhyānas can see one another. Yet even within the form realm, the five heavens of no-return cannot see each other, let alone those of the formless realm. Above the formless realm, Buddhism does not call them heavens. Even in the formless realm, body and mind are extinguished in the samādhi of cessation, seeing no karma before them, let alone those above. This is what Daoism calls \"non-action\" and Buddhism calls \"Buddha.\"\n\nThe numen’s wondrousness over the myriad things enables it to unite above with the Great Beginning and below with the multitude of things. United with the Great Beginning, it does not know the Great Beginning’s nothingness; united with the multitude of things, it does not know the multitude’s existence. Only when it emerges from the wondrous and descends to unite with things can the numen know itself—how could ghosts and spirits know it? Thus it is said: the numen is wondrous in a single thing, and ghosts and spirits cannot grasp its numinosity.\n\nOur primordial numen of the primordial heavens swallows the red, internalizes the yellow, inhales the blue-green, and wears the white, gathering the primordial in our Primordial Palace as the Great One, the numinous mother. The primordial heavens do not seek the five colors, yet the five colors arise naturally, like the eyes, ears, nose, and tongue arising from form, without anyone making them known. Thus, the primordial is gathered in the Primordial Palace as the Great One, the numinous mother. The primordial is the profound, the profound is the void, and the void is the mother.\n\nWithin the profound, swallowing the red, internalizing the yellow, inhaling the blue-green, and wearing the white—these are the true colors of the five phases. Yet it is not that we intentionally swallow, internalize, inhale, or wear them; these four are inherent within the Great One. When the mechanism moves, colors respond; when the numen moves, heaven follows—what Buddhism calls \"the nature-color is true emptiness, the nature-emptiness is true color.\" If you are empty and luminous, then emptiness manifests; earth, water, fire, and wind each illuminate and each manifest. If all illuminate together, then all manifest together. Swallowing and internalizing, inhaling and wearing—these are also the meaning of illumination.\n\nOur primordial oneness moves seven times and stabilizes nine times, beginning numinously and ending numinously, returning to the primordial primordial. Numbers begin at one, are completed at three, centered at five, transformed at seven, and exhausted at nine—thus the generating numbers belong to heaven. From one to five, the yang number three is obtained. The completing numbers belong to earth. From six to ten, the yin number two is obtained. This is the meaning of the *Yijing*’s \"three heavens and two earths.\" Thus, five is the center; the central five is unused, and ten is the extreme, which returns to one. Excluding five and ten, from one to four are the great numbers of things’ generation, and from six to nine are the great numbers of things’ completion.\n\nFrom one comes two, and there is above and below; above and below are established, and the center stands. With above, center, and below, there is three. With three, there is left, right, front, and back—thus four. Three is yang, so humans and heavens obtain it and stand firm. Four is yin, so the beings beside them obtain it and lie horizontally.\n\nIn the beginning of primordial numbers, one is heaven, two is earth. Heaven’s one becomes three, and earth’s two becomes four. Heaven’s numbers are recorded by eons, earth’s numbers by realms. Thus, eons are three, realms are four. The *Śūraṅgama Sūtra*’s \"three fours, four threes\" revolve to make twelve—the great number of heaven and earth. The formation of worlds, the completion of lands, the birth of all things, down to the years, days, months, and stars—all twelve transformations return to one, cycling back. This is the great number of things’ generation.\n\nThe \"movement at seven\" refers to governance by the seven luminaries, the stars by the seven regulators, and the years by the seven completions. The \"seven movements\" are the sun, moon, and five planets as the weft. The \"seven regulators\" are the four times seven, twenty-eight constellations as the warp. A month has dark and new moons, crescents and full moons—four times seven, twenty-eight days and a fraction—when the sun and moon conjoin. A year has twelve conjuctions, and dark, new, crescent, and full moons total forty-eight and a fraction—this is the seven-times-seven number.\n\nThe \"exhaustion at nine\" refers to heaven’s nine heavens, earth’s nine regions, ranks’ nine grades, and humans’ nine classes. A day has twelve two-hour periods, of which seven are fully bright, and sometimes bright makes nine. From *mao* to *you* is fully bright; *yin* and *xu* are sometimes bright. Thus, seven movements and nine stabilizations reach twelve and are exhausted—this is the great number of things’ completion. Therefore, one, three, and five are yang within yang; seven and nine are yin within yang. Those who attain the Dao can sever the yin of seven and return to yang, sever the yin of nine and return to one—thus it is called \"seven returns, nine reversions.\" The meaning is taken from this, so it is said: beginning numinously and ending numinously, returning to the primordial primordial.\n\nWho knows our primordial beginning? Knowing the primordial beginning’s non-numinosity, there is nothing that is not numinous. Not knowing the primordial beginning’s numinosity—this is the numen’s wondrousness, emerging from presence and entering absence, transforming beyond measure.",

      "translated_text": "If one then takes transformation and change to be the numinous, this is incorrect. The numinous arises from the wondrous, which in turn emerges from the primordial authenticity of the primordial beginning. When the heart’s intentions are inwardly severed and consciousness returns to spontaneity, the numinous is fundamentally non-numinous. Only by being non-numinous does the numinous become all-pervasive.\n\n**Chapter Seven (150 words)**\nThe numinous is non-numinous; the non-numinous is numinous. One numen contains the primordial; ten thousand numina return to the one. The numen, though non-numinous, divides into numina; the numen, though non-numinous, is numinous. If the heart harbors thought, the numen binds to that thought and halts—how then can the one become the ten thousand? The numina, numinous in their own right, know nothing of one another.\n\nOnly when heart-intention and consciousness are inwardly severed and emotions dissolved do the ten thousand numina intermingle and arise. When they contain the primordial and return of themselves, the ten thousand numina revert to the one. As they arise, they arise spontaneously; as they return, they return spontaneously—this is the Dao of the non-numinous.\n\nI was transformed by the primordial beginning yet know it not. The numinous begins with the primordial; the primordial is the mother of the numinous. What then is the primordial of the primordial, the origin of origins? The numen of the primordial, the primordial of the numen—mutually without form, mutually with presence, the primordial beginning knows it not. I am born of the Dao of spontaneity.\n\nThe numinous arises from the wondrous, without end or beginning. It congeals spontaneously; it transforms spontaneously. Transformation becomes the numinous; congealment becomes the wondrous. Wondrous awareness is without form; transformed, it becomes the numen. The numen’s form is elusive; wondrous awareness is not nothingness, nor is the numen’s form presence. Thus, form is both presence and absence—the primordial beginning knows it not.\n\nThe numen moves, the numen is still; one change, one transformation. The numen sees, the numen hears—none grasp its traces. The numina are not obscured; thus I first attain it. I am without movement or stillness, yet the numen moves and is still; I am without change or transformation, yet the numen changes and transforms; I am without seeing or hearing, yet the numen sees and hears—this is what is meant by \"the numina are not obscured, none grasp their traces.\" Only the primordial beginning attains it.\n\nAbiding in the elusive, the obscure, the profound and dark, the true one is spontaneous, dwelling in the deep and wondrous abode. The numen and the primordial give birth to one another; the numen gives birth to the numen. Yet the numen giving birth to the numen is not as good as having no numen. One giving birth to one is not as good as empty oneness. Spontaneously attaining the one.\n\nKnow the numen and guard the numen—the numen’s beginning is non-numinous. Know the one and guard the one—the one’s beginning is non-one. Being non-numinous, the numen becomes unfathomable. Being non-one, the ten thousand transformations return to the one. Thus, in the elusive, the obscure, the profound and dark, the true one is spontaneous, dwelling in the deep abode—this is the root of the numen. Therefore, the numina are not as good as having no numen; one-on-one is not as good as empty oneness.\n\nThe true primordial guards the true primordial in non-use—thus the numen attains longevity. The primordial gives birth to the primordial of the primordial; the numen creates transformation in the empty valley. I dwell in the wondrousness of the empty valley. Those who attain the Dao guard the true primordial in non-use—thus the numen attains longevity.\n\nThe reason people cannot attain longevity is that the six inner roots scatter into external use, chasing forms and sounds without return. If one can know the origin of the six senses’ dissipation, guard the true and discard the false, and return to the primordial of themselves, then the six roots are without use, the roots and dust dissolve inwardly, the spirit-light shines brightly, and the numen is born from nothingness—this is what is meant by \"creating transformation in the empty valley,\" the abode of longevity.\n\n**Chapter Eight (180 words)**\nThe numen’s wondrousness, the numen’s primordiality—presence and absence are spontaneous; I know not their use. The wondrous primordial is the non-numen of spontaneity; the numen is the wondrousness of spontaneity. The wondrous primordial becomes the numen—from nothingness, presence arises. The numen becomes the wondrous primordial—from presence, nothingness arises. Both arise from spontaneity; I know not their use.\n\nUsing the numen’s obscurity, stabilizing the numen’s clarity—numinous clarity, numinous obscurity, the numen intermingles with the primordial yellow. The primordial yellow intermingles with the numen; I know not its presence. Obscurity is the root of clarity; the wondrous is the root of the numen. Obscurity unites with the wondrous; clarity responds to change—the numen intermingles with the primordial yellow.\n\nThe primordial yellow is heaven and earth. The numen intermingles with heaven and earth; heaven and earth intermingle with the numen—those who engage with presence are complete. Engaging with presence, I know not its presence.\n\nThe non-numinous is the child of the primordial; the non-primordial is the mother of the numen. The mother of the numen does not give birth; the wondrous primordial unites with the numen. Know the mother and guard the child—the Dao unites with spontaneity.\n\nThe numen is the child of the primordial; the primordial is the mother of the numen. The reason the numen is non-numinous is that it emerges from the primordial. The reason the primordial is non-primordial is that it can give birth to the numen. Know the mother of the primordial and guard the child of the numen—the Dao unites with spontaneity.\n\nThe primordial of the primordial gives birth to blackness; the numen of the numen gives birth to whiteness. Know whiteness and guard blackness—numinous clarity arises of itself. The extremity of the primordial of the primordial is the profound, which is blackness. The extremity of the numen is the manifest, which is whiteness. Know whiteness and guard blackness—its whiteness is inexhaustible. Know the numen and guard the numen—its numen is unfathomable.\n\nThe numen comes without coming; the primordial beginning is great simplicity. Within the primordial is great simplicity—all vessels are without presence; the numen and the primordial are wondrous vessels. Taking the great simplicity within the primordial as a vessel, not knowing the vessel’s encounter with the numen or the numen’s encounter with the vessel—this is called \"the numen without coming,\" the vessel beyond vessels. Thus, all vessels are without presence.\n\n**Chapter Nine (69 words)**\nThe numen dwells in the wondrous valley, giving birth to the empty chamber. The empty and wondrous valley is my primordial beginning’s wondrous abode. The valley is empty and receptive; the wondrous is empty and responsive. Thus, the valley contains the ten thousand images; the wondrous contains the ten thousand numina. Within the empty chamber, utmost whiteness arises of itself, pure and unadulterated—thus it is called \"the one.\"\n\nThe wondrousness of the primordial beginning is like the valley, like the chamber—receptive to all. The numen is born within the primordial; movement only increases its presence. The beginning of the primordial one is the numen’s dwelling. Embrace it, guard it, carry it, convey it. Steal it and steal it again; steal and steal again—spirits and things come and go. The wondrous valley is profoundly empty—this is called the true thief.\n\nThe numen dwells within the primordial. Embrace it, guard it, carry it, convey it. If it is not mine, to possess what is not one’s own is called stealing.",

Not knowing the primordial beginning’s numinosity—this is the numen’s wondrousness, emerging from presence and entering absence, transforming beyond measure.",

The *Yijing* says: \"Did the author of the *Changes* know about stealing?\" The *Changes* speaks of inexhaustible generation; the more it is used, the more it increases—like stealing another’s possessions, reaping without sowing, naturally responsive in application.

The numen is never without display of martial power, never without destruction of being. Keen hearing, clear sight, and divine wisdom enable the washing of the heart, the retreat to conceal being.

      "translated_text": "True, true, true—where the numen is, there is no lack of efficacy; where efficacy is, there is the numen. Efficacy is the function of the numen, and in the wondrousness of the true-true, efficacy is also the numen. Thus, the refined is wondrous, and the coarse is wondrous. The Dao of the Nine Returns, the profound truth of the boundless, is non-action and non-creation, where truth is complete and the numen is withdrawn. Attaining oneness is truth; when the count reaches nine and returns, ten is but one. If there be hundreds, thousands, or tens of thousands, they are but extensions of ten. From one to nine, all things are encompassed; when nine returns to ten, it is the meaning of reverting to the root. Withdrawing the numen to preserve truth whole, in non-action and non-creation, is called the True Person. The vessel of absolute constancy is the great simplicity of the primordial true. True, true, true—true, true, true—true, true, true.\n\nThe Dao has great and small, but truth is the mother of the Dao. The multitude enters truth through the Dao, and after truth, the numen. The perfected person enters truth through the numen, withdrawing the numen to return to the root. Thus it is said: the vessel of absolute constancy is the great simplicity of the primordial true. The reiteration of *true, true, true* signifies the absence of admixture.\n\n*Chapter Two: One Hundred and Eleven Sayings*\n\nBoundless and obscure, utmost refinement and truth—the numen is one and undivided, constant in transformation and change. The boundless and obscure are not nothingness; refined truth arises from the boundless and obscure. Thus, the boundless and obscure are the root of refined truth. Embracing refinement and guarding the numen, undivided and undispersed, transformation and change emerge therefrom. People often seek transformation and change in transformation and change, yet do not know that natural transformation and change are inevitable. For the boundless and obscure are the root of refined truth, and oneness is the root of transformation and change. Seeking refined truth will not yield refined truth; seeking transformation and change will not yield transformation and change. If the numen is undivided, then transformation and change are inevitable, and there is no need for words—this is why the sage values non-action.\n\nThe wondrous existence of the primordial true, the natural oneness of truth—deep-rooted and firmly established. Wondrous existence is all-encompassing; within the primordial true, heaven and earth are positioned, and the myriad things are nurtured. People see it as such yet do not know it is the natural oneness of truth, deeply rooted and firmly established, rooted in wondrous non-being. Only because it is rooted in wondrous non-being does wondrous existence unfold like roots bearing branches, like flowers bearing fruit—all according to natural principle.\n\nOne and again one, faith and again faith—faith upon faith, unbroken, outlasting heaven and earth. One is all-encompassing oneness. Faith is all-encompassing trust. The flaw of those who study the Dao lies in their inability to be one and their inability to trust. Thus, in action, they are one person; in stillness, another. In speech, they are one person; in silence, another. Such is not oneness. They trust in true principles but not in the untruth of the principle-less. They trust in purity but not in the purity of the object-less. They trust in a single self but do not know that within the six directions, there is nowhere that is not the self. They trust in a single mind but do not know that in things great and small, there is nothing that is not the mind. Such is not trust. Without oneness, one cannot be forced into oneness; without trust, one cannot be forced into trust. To ensure unwavering trust and oneness, one must be one again and again, trust again and again. Without true insight, one cannot achieve such unbroken trust. Though heaven and earth may end, this insight shall never be exhausted.\n\nThe wondrous oneness of the true Dao, the natural true Dao—each truth is true in its own way, and a single truth bends to preserve the whole. Knowing the natural truth, in all application, there is nothing that is not so of itself. The scholar of the Dao applies all things as emptiness; when encountering matters, they respond without attachment; when unoccupied, they remain empty without desolation. Thus, in action, truth; in stillness, truth; in directness, truth; in bending, truth. In action, stillness is not lost; in bending, directness is not lost. Thus it is said: truth bends to preserve the whole.\n\nOur Primordial True One, the Dao has attained its ultimate in oneness. Confucius said to Zigong: \"Ci, do you think I am one who learns much and retains it?\" Zigong replied: \"Is it not so?\" Confucius said: \"It is not. I unify it with one.\" Moreover, learning much and retaining it is a flaw of learning. The flaw of retention lies in not knowing oneness. If one knows oneness, then benevolence and righteousness do not conflict, loyalty and filial piety do not oppose, firmness and softness do not contradict, bending and straightness do not harm, action and stillness do not disorder, speech and silence do not oppose. Thus, the Dao is one Dao, and things are one thing. Things do not differ from the Dao; the Dao does not differ from things. The refined is also coarse, and the coarse is also refined. Thus it is said: penetrating oneness, all matters are complete.\n\nAll truths rest, yet I do not know their rest—primordial true wondrous oneness. In action, nothing is not true; thus, in rest, nothing is not true. In action, there is no action in truth; in rest, there is no rest. Thus it is said: \"I do not know its rest\"—this is called the primordial true wondrous oneness.\n\nOur Primordial True One is established at the primordial head; the Dao of true oneness—there is nothing in which I am not one. Our primordial true ultimate Dao—all truths return to my oneness, and the true Dao is truly constant.\n\nThe *Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra* records the eternalist debate of the external paths: some say all things are originally eternal, eternally unchanging; others say things are originally non-eternal, yet conceive them as eternal through thought and calculation. If things are originally non-eternal but conceived as eternal through thought and calculation, then eternity is not real. Refuting this, Laozi said: \"Knowing constancy is called illumination\"—this is the true Dao. The true constancy of constancy is oneness, truth, wondrousness, the primordial, the numen, and the Dao. Thus it is said: \"There is nothing in which I am not one; all truths return to my oneness.\" Not only this—principle is in affairs, things are the self, taking is in having, receiving is in love. There is nothing that is not one, nothing that is not empty—this is called true constancy and ultimate oneness.\n\n*Chapter Three: Fifty-Two Sayings*\n\nWondrous oneness, primordial oneness, numinous oneness—these three onenesses are the same. The true wondrous oneness is undispersed; in non-action, transformation and change arise from the primordial true naturalness. Wondrousness is not wondrous, the primordial is not primordial, the numen is not the numen—why? Because they are one in the true.",

      "translated_text": "Thus, the true oneness remains undispersed, and so its transformations are unfathomable—yet still natural. Perceive oneness, preserve oneness, embrace oneness, and enter my primordial oneness.\n\nFirst, one must perceive oneness in the nothing-that-is-not-one; only then can one preserve oneness. Only by preserving oneness in the nothing-that-is-not-one can one embrace oneness. If one cannot perceive, one cannot preserve; if one cannot preserve, one cannot embrace; if one cannot embrace, one cannot enter.\n\nTherefore, perception of oneness comes first. If, in things, one fails to perceive oneness, then short and long harm each other, self and other clash—how then could one preserve it without loss? My Most High, the Primordial Beginning, the Wondrously Fixed—true oneness, the Great Oneness—these are the exalted names of the Primordial Beginning, and those who attain them are true.\n\nThe Primordial Beginning and the Wondrously Fixed are what the Śākya school calls *nirvāṇa*. The *Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra* states that *nirvāṇa* and emptiness are not distinct in meaning—this is precisely what is meant by true oneness and the Great Oneness.\n\n*Chapter Four: One Hundred Forty-Two Sayings*\n\nThe one truth returns to the primordial; the ten thousand transformations revert to oneness. Guarding the true oneness, one enters my numinous heaven. There is nothing that is not one; oneness cannot be fixed as one. The truth of the Primordial Beginning, the Dao’s oneness unchanging, the numen’s oneness untransforming—returning to the wondrous primordial, the primordial’s one Dao.\n\nThe true returns to the primordial; the ten thousand revert to one. Guarding the true and preserving oneness—this is called numinous heaven. The wondrousness of numinous heaven: there is nothing that is not one.\n\nIn the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra*, the Buddha tells Mañjuśrī: \"The Tathāgata abides in *samādhi*, seeing both the seen and the conditions of seeing, along with the imagined forms, like flowers in empty space—fundamentally nonexistent. This seeing and its conditions are originally the bodhisattva’s wondrously pure luminous essence, entrusted to the midst of existence. Is this so or not? You, Mañjuśrī, are yet another Mañjuśrī. Since you recognize the true within it, there are in reality no dualities of right and wrong. Yet the eye sees, the roots connect to dust and form, and from within the dust and form, knowing arises in *samādhi*. Observe these dust-conditions as like flowers in space—what existence do they truly have? One cannot call them real. Though they are flowers in space, the knowing of these flowers is originally bodhi—one cannot call it unreal.\"\n\nNow, using the Buddha’s words to illuminate and compare: the eye sees form, and the ten thousand things differ. From this, who is the one origin? Their root source is my primordial. If the wondrous were not primordial, the wondrous dust would have nothing to depend upon. Thus, who is not one? Before recognizing Mañjuśrī’s words as Mañjuśrī’s, there is right and wrong. Once Mañjuśrī is recognized, the dualities of right and wrong naturally do not arise. One and not-one are likewise. Because one does not know oneness, there is right and wrong, discrimination and inquiry. Once the true one is seen, these distinctions vanish of themselves. One and not-one—thus it is said: there is nothing that is not one.\n\nAs for \"oneness cannot be fixed as one,\" this means oneness cannot be defined. If one fixes oneness as a single thing, then it is one and unchanging—hence oneness cannot be fixed as one. If the Dao is said to be unchanging, then it is not the Dao; if the numen is said to be untransforming, then it is not the numen. Only when oneness returns to the wondrous primordial—though the ten thousand differ, oneness does not see oneness—is this called the Dao of primordial oneness.\n\nMy Primordial Beginning is the utmost true and boundless. The highest truth of the primordial Dao gives rise to my Way of no-spirit. The utmost of the true, the highest of the Dao—no-spirit, no-bound—this is called the Primordial Beginning. The essence of the true-true relies on the primordial yellow; the number of the no-no suddenly becomes one, and I perceive it. The true-true has no essence, yet it forms an essence by relying on heaven and earth; the no-no has no number, yet it gains number by borrowing from the one. With essence, there are things; with number, there is growth. In things, one knows the true; in growth, one knows oneness—only those with the Dao can do this.\n\nWho can guard my true oneness, seeing the true in the wondrous true, knowing oneness in oneness, oneness in solitude, oneness in subtlety? Guarding it as the exalted one, from the beginningless to the boundless. Only by seeing the true can one see the true; only by knowing oneness can one know oneness. Only then can one see what others cannot see, know what others cannot know. In guarding it, one attains utmost solitude and subtlety. In employing it, one attains utmost universality and vastness. In guarding it, one nears the beginningless. In employing it, one reaches the boundless.\n\nTrue constancy is non-action; wondrous oneness is numberless. Non-action and numberless—this is the Primordial Beginning’s true oneness. Action involves boundaries; number involves things. True constancy is the wondrous boundary, the boundaryless boundary; true oneness is the wondrous number, the numberless number—thus it is called the Primordial Beginning’s true oneness. The spiritless abides in the multitude of beginnings, the Dao complete; numberless, truly complete, non-action—this is truly attaining the true.\n\nIf one does not recognize the true, then a speck of dust can obscure the heavens, a mustard seed can overturn the earth. If one sees the true, then even amid affairs and things, one remains numberless, actionless. This is because the multitude lacks the true, and so what they see is never true. The sage is true of himself, and so what he encounters is never not true—this is called truly attaining the true.\n\n*Chapter Five: Fifteen Sayings*\n\nGuard the true with the true, and no falsity arises. Sincerity in sincerity—this is attaining the true Dao. Guarding the true with the true, there is no falsity that is not true. Seeking the true with the false, there is no truth that is not false.\n\nThe *Doctrine of the Mean* says: \"Sincerity is the Dao of Heaven; pursuing sincerity is the Dao of man.\" What is called Heaven is sincerity arising from within, as if naturally, without any who are insincere. If one has intentions regarding sincerity, then it is pursuing sincerity. Pursuit involves deviation; pursuit involves falsity. The decline of the human Dao begins here.\n\nSincerity in sincerity—no thought, only trust. At the utmost of trust, sincerity arises naturally. This is the utmost of the true Dao.\n\n*Chapter Six: One Hundred Fifteen Sayings*\n\nThe numen gives rise to the true; the true gives rise to the numen. When the numen unites with the true, transformations are fixed and unchanging.",
      "overlap_context": "ve. There is nothing that is not one, nothing that is not empty—this is called true constancy and ultimate oneness.\n\n*Chapter Three: Fifty-Two Sayings*\n\nWondrous oneness, primordial oneness, numinous oneness—these three onenesses are the same. The true wondrous oneness is undispersed; in non-action, transformation and change arise from the primordial true naturalness. Wondrousness is not wondrous, the primordial is not primordial, the numen is not the numen—why? Because they are one in the true.",

      "translated_text": "The numen enters the true; attaining oneness, one then enters the numinous and reaches the utmost true. I return to the boundless.\n\nWhen the true and the numen unite, though there is change and transformation, there is no change and no transformation—all rooted in the natural. The numen enters the true numinously; its transformations are unseen. Thus, attaining oneness, one obtains oneness. Though there be a thousand changes and ten thousand transformations, all emerge from non-being. This is called \"I return to the boundless.\"\n\nIn the Great Beginning, the true One had not yet arisen. The numbers of the indistinct and vague existed at the tip of a hair’s end. The Primal Beginning grasped its wondrous number, guarded the One without change, stabilized the unchanging origin, and held fast to the numen without parting. With the true guarding the numen, the numen is not seen to be guarded.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* says: \"Trace beginnings to their end, and thus know the explanations of life and death.\" Before I was born, whence did I come? When my end arrives, whither shall I go? If one knows whence one comes, one may know whither one departs.\n\nAt the beginning of the Great One, in the unborn origin, the numbers of the indistinct and vague existed at the tip of a hair’s end. At that time, the One was whole and undivided. The Primal Beginning grasped its wondrous number—wondrous number being the One. The Primal Beginning could guard the One without change, stabilize the unchanging origin, and thus stand alone before heaven and earth.\n\nHumans wander in life and death because they cannot preserve the One within non-being, cannot maintain the One of the Great Beginning. Instead, they divide it into six functions, gather dust to form roots, and thus all forms and images lack a fixed origin. Unable to stabilize roots and bind form, joy and anger alter their nature, sorrow and delight stir their emotions. Abandoning the root to pursue the branch, they depart from the Primal Beginning.\n\nThe perfected one is not thus. Knowing that dust is illusory, dust cannot cling. Since dust does not cling, the six do not divide the One. The One is whole within non-being, inwardly radiant and luminous. Thus, there is the function of non-being, the Dao of stabilizing the beginning. Naturally, the numen does not part from the One, and the One does not part from the numen. With the true guarding the numen, the numen is not seen to be guarded. Why? Because the root does not part; thus, the root naturally does not part, and guarding is without use.\n\nI do not act as the function of non-being, nor dwell in the forms of being. The wondrous valley contains the true; the wondrous true contains the empty. The wondrous Primal One of the true One—I attain the true of myself.\n\nKnowing that the numen arises from the true is to be the function of non-being. Knowing that the true can give rise to the numen is to generate the forms of being. Though I act as the function of non-being, and though I take form in being, all stems from knowing the beginning.\n\nThus, the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* says: \"When knowledge establishes knowledge, it is the root of ignorance. When knowledge is without seeing, this is nirvana—unblemished, truly pure.\" Only in the function of non-function, functioning yet not functioning; in the forms of being, forming yet not forming. Knowledge does not arise; knowledge is without seeing. This is the wondrous valley containing the true, the wondrous true containing the empty. The true true attains itself—I know not its attainment.\n\nAttaining the One is no attainment, yet true attainment. The true Primal is wondrous; the true One is without being.\n\nIn learning the Dao, if there is the slightest attainment, it is dust and toil. Thus, the *Scripture of Purity* says: \"Though called attaining the Dao, in reality there is nothing attained.\" The Buddhist scriptures say: \"In the Dharma, there is truly nothing attained.\" If one speaks of attainment, what is attained can be lost. What can be attained and lost is not true seeing. If one attains the One yet truly has no attainment, the One cannot be parted. I am the One; the One is I. This is called true attainment—the true One is without being.\n\n*Chapter Seven: One Hundred Fifty-Two Sayings*\n\nRadiant, the true Primal; profound, the wondrous One. Vast and empty, the Primal Valley—dimly, a jade chamber arises. I now embrace the Primal Simplicity, contain the Yellow Ultimate, stabilize the cinnabar uncarved block—without color, without sound. Silent, the true body becomes one with me.\n\nThe true Primal, the wondrous One—radiant in its simplicity, profound in its depth. Like a valley’s emptiness, like a chamber’s warmth. Embracing the Primal Simplicity is the color of heaven; containing the Yellow Ultimate is the image of earth. Embracing the Primal and containing the Yellow encompasses heaven and earth, forming the cinnabar uncarved block.\n\nThe so-called cinnabar uncarved block is without color, without sound—silent, the true body. If one takes the having of the uncarved as the uncarved, it is the division of Primal Yellow, not its wholeness. Embracing the Primal and containing the Yellow, then heaven and earth are undivided. From before the beginning of heaven and earth, the true body is one with me.\n\nThis true body was originally one with me. Because I was not one, I became different from the One, and thus lost the Primal Constant. The Dao of the Primal Constant is the One attaining itself. I, in the Primal Beginning, attained the Dao of the true One. The great image of Primal Yellow, the wondrous One—pure and clear. From emptiness, the One transforms. The true Primal does not change; the Dao cannot be attained.\n\nThe great image of Primal Yellow had no image at the beginning. Only the wondrous One—pure and clear. From emptiness, the One transforms, and the great Dao arises. The true Primal does not change—wondrously wondrous, without form; Primal Primal, without body; numinous numinous, without number; true true, without change—thus, the Dao cannot be attained.\n\nThe great Dao conceals the true; the true Primal is without action. The numen and the true are fixed as one, arising and departing without going. The true name endures—this is called trust.\n\nThe flowing true, the distant true—return to the One. The true disperses into the Dao; the Dao conceals the utmost true. The Dao is in the world—great as the wondrous Primal, small as benevolence and righteousness—thus, the Dao has great and small. Those who attain the Dao live; those who lose the Dao die—thus, the Dao has attainment and loss. When humans exist, the Dao flourishes; when humans perish, the Dao decays—thus, the Dao has flourishing and decay.\n\nYet the true One, the wondrous Primal—without action, without cessation; without going, without coming. Abiding in stillness, it eternally remains. Arising and departing without going—thus, the true is the constant Dao. The true name endures. The true descends from the Dao, flowing without losing trust, distant without losing the beginning. The Dao disperses into things, departing far from the root.

Thus, retiring to conceal in secrecy is to be without self; sharing the people’s concerns is to be without things.

Guarding the nameless, stabilizing the uncarved—this is called \"primal simplicity,\" the wondrous Dao of long life and enduring vision.\n\nHaving a name is to be the same as things; being graspable is to be the same as vessels. Only by guarding the nameless and stabilizing the uncarved—without things, without vessels—can there be no gain, no loss. This is called \"long life and enduring vision.\"\n\n---\n\nChapter Eight, Two Hundred Eighteen Words\n\nVague and indistinct—within fire, the spirit is born.\nDeep and obscure—within water, essence is born.\nFire blazes upward, seven transformations give rise to spirit.\nWater flows downward, six evolutions give rise to essence.\nSeven and six transform and change, above and below complete each other.\nSpirit and essence come and go—from the wondrous body, the true is born.\nSpirit’s seven transformations give rise to true fire.\nEssence’s six evolutions give rise to true water.\nSix and seven make thirteen wonders.\n\nSpirit is born from the vague and indistinct, belonging to fire.\nEssence is born from the deep and obscure, belonging to water.\nFire’s nature is to ascend; water’s nature is to descend.\nAbove and below intermingle, spirit and essence come and go.\nThus, within water there is fire; within fire there is water.\nWithin essence there is spirit; within spirit there is essence.\nThis is called \"seven and six transform and change, above and below complete each other.\"\n\nHeaven’s One gives birth to water—its nature is fundamentally yang.\nIts form is completed in six and belongs to yin.\nEarth’s Two gives birth to fire—its nature is fundamentally yin.\nIts form is completed in seven and belongs to yang.\nWater is born above yet its nature descends; fire is born below yet its nature ascends.\n\n*Zhuangzi* says: \"Utmost yin is solemn; utmost yang is blazing. Solemn qi emerges from heaven; blazing qi issues from earth.\" Solemn qi originally emerges from heaven—Heaven’s One in operation descends and moves downward. Midway, it intersects with Heaven’s Five, taking form as six, giving birth to water and belonging to earth. Blazing qi originally issues from earth—Earth’s Two in operation rises and moves upward. Midway, it intersects with Heaven’s Five, taking form as seven, giving birth to fire and belonging to heaven. Thus, water is fundamentally of heaven yet its completion is of earth—within humans, it is essence. Fire is fundamentally of earth yet its completion is of heaven—within humans, it is spirit. Hence, it is called \"six evolutions, seven transformations.\" Seven and six transformations combine to make thirteen. Yet these thirteen are but the forms of water and fire—their already transformed, already evolved substance, not the primal transformation or primal evolution.\n\nThe wonder of my utmost truth: the true One is born from the beginning of wondrous numbers. Within spirit, essence and I are born into life; within essence, spirit and I enter death. Death is not annihilation; life is not flourishing. Know, guard, and employ the thirteen wonders—long life and enduring vision. My Dao unites with the true; this is called the \"true person.\"\n\nThirteen is the completion of numbers, the substance of water and fire. When water and fire meet as substances, they clash and cannot coexist. Only the primal numbers of water and fire—true water concealed within true fire, true fire concealed within true water—remain uncorrupted. This is what *The Book of Changes* means by \"water and fire do not repel each other,\" referring to the capacity of true water and fire to coexist.\n\nThe perfected person knows this: seeking water’s truth in the heart, matching it with mercury in the heart; seeking fire’s truth in the kidneys, matching it with lead in the kidneys. The heart is spirit—within spirit there is essence, and that essence is indestructible. The kidneys are essence—within essence there is spirit, and that spirit is imperishable. Though born into life, it is not truly born—hence \"life is not flourishing.\" Though entering death, it does not die—hence \"death is not annihilation.\" The true person, within the thirteen forms, recognizes the thirteen wonders, knows and guards them—long life and enduring vision.\n\nThe true person embraces the One, attains the One, and contains the true. Heaven’s fire is spirit; earth’s water is essence. Heaven and earth’s spirit and essence, seven and six water and fire—I unite them as the true. Returning the thirteen to the wondrous, the true One is natural. Wondrous numbers unite with the true—the Dao of entering death and emerging into life is attained.\n\nWater and fire are two things, sharing the same origin yet differing in form, mutually overcoming yet mutually completing. Only the true person can then unite them. Thus, they embrace them to prevent separation, attain them to prevent dispersion, and contain them to prevent differentiation. Uniting heaven and earth’s spirit and essence, seven and six water and fire, all fulfill their functions. Only by returning the thirteen to the wondrous does the true One become natural.\n\nIf one does not know the thirteen’s return to the wondrous but merely relies on the dead substance of water and fire without following their origin, they will mutually overcome—water will fail, fire will scatter, and death will come before the morning is over. Ignorant of the thirteen wondrous numbers, one loses the true and courts death—this I call \"true death.\"",

Yet the true has never lost the One, never parted from it. If one can return to the One and revert to the true, restoring the Primal Beginning, then it has never dispersed, never perished.",

      "translated_text": "Before differentiation, the undivided merges as the One True. I now guard the Primordial Beginning—dim and indistinct, I do not perceive the thirteen wondrous numbers, nor the Dao of spontaneity, for they reside in my Three Essentials. I know these essentials, yet I know not their marvels. This speaks of water and fire: though true, they are not the True.\n\nMy utmost True begins with me. Before differentiation, the united becomes the True. At this very moment, what are water and fire? I guard the Primordial Beginning—dim and indistinct—what then are the thirteen wondrous numbers, or the Dao of spontaneity? They intermingle and complete one another, evolving from the One into the Three.\n\nThe Three are thus: water as one, fire as two, and their union as three. This is called the Three Essentials. Once the Three Essentials are achieved, they naturally pair and harmonize—no agent compels them. In me, they have never been separate; yet I know not their marvels. This is not deliberate ignorance, but rather spontaneous completion—though unknown, it may be so.\n\nFirmly established in the Great Beginning, guarding and stabilizing the Primordial Origin, the Dao unites with the Primordial True. I enter the boundless and infinite, refining through eons to crystallize the wondrous One, the numinous origin. The numbers of dimness, the True of profound obscurity, the spirit of spontaneity—these give birth to the Primordial Beginning and culminate in the Primordial Ultimate. The wondrous numbers of the Great True, the true Dao of the Primordial Beginning—when the Primordial Beginning employs them, they perfectly form heaven and earth.\n\nBy refining and transforming water and fire, by intermingling and nurturing the spirit, one may attain the Dao, yet this is not the utmost. The utmost must lie in firm establishment in the Great Beginning, in guarding and stabilizing the Primordial Origin, in the Dao uniting with the Primordial True, in entering the boundless, in refining through eons to crystallize the wondrous One, the numinous origin. The spirit of spontaneity—without beginning or end, neither number nor non-number, neither Dao nor non-Dao—only then can one transform the myriad things.

Their qi mutually overcome, thus they contend in Qian.\nOnce Qian’s metal is pure, water issues from its mother, flowing without cease—thus it toils in Kan.\nWhen water overflows, it returns to the origin. Wood is water’s child; the mother goes to join the child. Wind and water harmonize, water returns to wind, restoring the Primordial True.\nThus it is said: beginning the myriad things, ending the myriad things—none surpasses Gen.\nAs the eightfold functions interweave, the Emperor emerges from Zhen, wandering the eight directions. The marvel of the Primordial Beginning scatters among the myriad things—hence it is said: the Primordial Emperor wanders in the origin—I lose the Primordial Beginning.\nWhen the origin-Dao completes its cycle, things reach Gen to accomplish the year’s work; humans refine essence to transform into spirit, thereby returning to the Dao of the Primordial Beginning.\n\nThe Three Ones are Qian; the Six Origins are Kun. Qian is odd, Kun even—the eight trigrams begin to arise.\nThus: wearing nine, treading one; left three, right seven; two and four as shoulders, six and eight as feet; five residing in the center. Vertically and horizontally, eightfold shifts—nothing loses the fifteen. This is the Five Transformations, Eight Shifts, the spirit-Dao of True Unity.\n\nThe Dao generates Dao-form; form in turn generates the Dao. The Dao again generates form—coming and going above and below, Dao-form and Dao-qi, form and qi ascending and descending—my Dao completes one cycle.\nThe forms of the multitude cannot generate the Dao; they ultimately return to dissolution. Even the forms of Heaven and Earth cannot escape this.\nWhat makes humans noble above Heaven and Earth is their capacity to employ Heaven and Earth, coming and going above and below, unbound by form or qi.\nThus they enter fire without burning, enter water without wetting; when united, they form a body; when scattered, they form a pattern. Dao-qi and form return to Nonbeing.\n\nThe Dao has no use; virtue has no action. Yet use unceasing becomes boundless; action unrelenting becomes infinite. Pressed, wondrous transformation is achieved—above, the image; below, the form; the Primordial Emperor wanders in the center. Ending its beginning, beginning its end—the Emperor’s origin and the Dao return.\nNot knowing that my generation of the Dao restores True attainment, I enter my Primordial Beginning.\nThe Dao takes non-use as its use; virtue takes non-action as its action.\nThe use of non-use is use without cease.\nThe action of non-action is action without end.\nThus within the un-wondrous and un-transformed, wondrous transformation is pressed into being.\n“Pressed into being” means “immediately achieved.”\nThis is what is meant by not destroying worldly dharmas yet attaining the true aspect. People merely see its image in Heaven, its form on Earth, yet do not know the Emperor wanders within—ending yet beginning, beginning yet ending. Things have their beginning and end; I have no beginning or end. Things have their arising and ceasing; I have no arising or ceasing.\nWith the Dao returning to the Dao, with True returning to True, I enter my spirit-origin.\n\nOne True, eight spirits, twenty-four Dao-paths, seventy-two shifts.\nThe Three Origins divide their functions; the eight spirits share differences. Uniting with the Dao as True, one cycle is inexhaustible—origin-Dao is everlasting.\nI say: the Great Dao is One, beginning and end return to my constancy.\nOne True is one year; eight spirits are the eight solar terms; twenty-four Dao-paths are the twenty-four qi; seventy-two shifts are the seventy-two pentads.\nHeaven, Earth, and Man employ the Three Origins; hardness, softness, yin, and yang interweave the eight trigrams. Though thus divided, their divisions all arise from spontaneity.\nIn their utmost spontaneity, they unite with the Dao as True, cycling without end, generating without exhaustion—hence it is said: origin-Dao is everlasting.",

      "translated_text": "When this flow scatters, the origin of the Dao is lost. Yet this flowing current cannot be forcibly severed, for it is fundamentally the wondrous luminosity—the true, singular nature—flowing naturally, without any separate substance. If one generates the mind to grasp or suppress it, seeking to still the knowing mind, one only compounds disturbance. Thus it is said: \"To arise the mind desiring to still knowing, the mind arises and knowing grows more vexed.\" If one knows that ignorance is originally no different, yet through self-attachment one loses the pure essence—moment after moment, arising thoughts are each emptied, then from beginningless time, the accumulated weight of habitual tendencies suddenly becomes lucid and bright. When all is lucid and bright, this is the gateway to the myriad wonders. The Buddhist *Xin Ming* is no different in this regard. It speaks of using cessation to still movement, yet movement cannot be stilled, only adding more cessation-mind. Thus one clings to both poles, how can one know the singular purity? Movement and stillness are originally one, yet through self-differentiation they become distinct. Hence, that becomes separate from this—this is what is meant by \"if one place is obstructed, two places lose their efficacy.\" If one merely abandons impurity to seek purity, impurity cannot be removed. This is delusion by being, falling into being, turning from emptiness to oppose emptiness.\n\nThis sutra states: Purity does not lie in having no phenomena. Though the Dao scatters into hundreds, thousands, myriads, and billions, it remains without phenomena. Thus, having phenomena is also purity, and having no phenomena is also purity. For all things are originally pure; though they spread, they do not mix. Having phenomena does not mix, and having no phenomena does not mix. Purity is non-action; non-action is purity. The Dao is the pure, flowing source of all things. Unmixed yet not separate, scattered yet not lost. The pure flow of the Dao is the wondrous, originally pure sea. Why do I not return to it?\n\nPurity is non-action; non-action is purity. Non-action that acts is called the Dao-acting. Though the Dao-acting does not fail to act, it does not lose purity. The Dao is the origin of things; all things possess the Dao. Though mixed, they do not blend; though scattered, they do not lose the real. Only those who embody the Dao recognize this. Thus they can reverse the flow, preserve wholeness, and merge with the Dao’s current, returning to purity. The great sea has no current that does not return—this is called \"returning flow.\"\n\n**Chapter Eight, Thirty-Three Sayings**\nPurity gives rise to movement; movement gives rise to purity. I dwell in the wondrous movement of purity. Stillness is the essence of movement; movement is the function of stillness. When there is no affair, one abides in profound clarity, not bound by stillness. When affairs arise, one responds with non-mind, not turning with movement. As the *Dingguan* says: \"Abiding in clamor without aversion, engaging in affairs without vexation—this is true samadhi.\" One does not seek many affairs because of being unvexed by affairs, nor does one forcefully enter clamor because of being unaverse to clamor. Taking no-affair as the true dwelling and affairs as responsive traces—this is the meaning of purifying one’s abode, the wondrous movement of purity.\n\nThe Dao’s flow is perilous; its source is purity. All movements are one current; purity flows universally—this is the wondrous attainment. When water flows far, traversing perilous terrain, how can it remain necessarily pure? Yet its source must be pure. The Dao flows through things, traversing the world—how can it remain necessarily pure? Yet its origin must be pure. Though movements are many, their flow is one. Though things are numerous, their principle is one. Thus it is said: Purity flows universally. Those who attain it are pure in all things—hence, it is called wondrous.\n\n**Chapter Nine, One Hundred Seventy-Three Sayings**\nFlow arises from the solid; the Dao is empty and pure. Purity gives rise to emptiness—valley’s wondrousness, valley’s flow is purity. Movement arises from the solid; purity arises from emptiness. The mind empty, then still; the mind solid, then moving. What is meant by \"solid\"? Joy, anger, love, aversion—these obstruct it. If internally unobstructed, then the center is empty. An empty center is never impure. *Zhuangzi* says: \"If a room has no heavenly wandering, then mistress and maid will quarrel. If the mind has no heavenly wandering, then the six senses will contend.\" Heavenly wandering is called emptiness. Empty, then responsive—thus it is said: The valley contains all things; this is the valley’s wondrousness.\n\nThe Dao’s imperial flow is unimpeded, pure and without obstruction. Having phenomena, having no phenomena—responding to purity without daring to transgress. That by which purity is pure is its response without losing purity. Only by responding without losing purity can it be pure in all things. Thus the Dao’s imperial flow circulates through the myriad existences without obstruction. Purity without phenomena is emptiness. Having no phenomena is being. Responding to being and non-being without losing wondrous purity—thus the sutra says: \"Constantly responding, constantly pure, constantly pure indeed.\"\n\nPurity and wondrousness give rise to the numinous; the empty and singular transform. Pure and wondrous, without beginning—wondrousness without end, purity without end. The beginningless flows back. My beginninglessness is wondrous and unfathomable purity; purity is unfathomably wondrous. Purity is natural—from this it is attained. Purity gives rise to wondrousness, engaging the myriad existences, yet the numinous and empty singularly transform—being has never been being. Pure and wondrous, vast and boundless, without beginning, non-being yet not nothing. Thus wondrousness has no end—this is called the natural, unobservable. My wondrous Dharma gives rise to purity.\n\nArising without end, it completes heaven and earth, beginning with the primordial One. The pure, wondrous flow—up and down, containing the wondrousness of purity within. Purity, spirit, emptiness. Without form, without qi, purity enters and exits, stabilized in the heaven of purity. The original wondrous Dharma arises from purity. Arising without exhausting the origin, in non-action without end. Non-action has never had action, yet does not depart from action, even to the completion of heaven and earth—up and down, the pure, spiritual, and empty constantly flow within, without form, without qi, governing the myriad things, entering and exiting purity. Thus it is called the heaven of purity.\n\n*Mencius* says: \"Exhausting one’s mind, one knows one’s nature. Knowing one’s nature, one knows Heaven.\" He also says: \"Preserving the mind and nourishing the nature, one serves Heaven.\"",

      "translated_text": "Heaven is the wondrous purity of the original beginning—without form, without qi. The affliction of humanity lies in the inability to restore one’s nature; if nature is not restored, the mind is not exhausted. What is not exhausted refers to the failure to forget joy, anger, sorrow, and delight. From joy, anger, sorrow, and delight, the mind transforms into emotion; when these arise without moderation, emotion becomes the master. Thus the mind is not exhausted. If, amid joy, anger, sorrow, and delight, one can respond with compliance, so that though joy, anger, sorrow, and delight exist, their roots are extinguished of emotion—within the roots, response is extinguished by nature—then what arises will necessarily be moderate, and harmony and principle will emerge. In this way, there is joy yet not joy, anger yet not anger, and likewise sorrow and delight yet not sorrow and delight: this is called exhausting the mind and restoring nature. When the mind is exhausted and nature is pure, it cannot but be called Heaven.\n\nThe primordial emptiness is unmoving; the One Reality universally arises. Purity wondrously pervades; the Dao abides in its beginning. The Great One is inexhaustible; I enter the beginning and end of purity. The Way of divine transcendence is nothing but purity. The primordial emptiness is spontaneous, never having moved. As for the One Reality universally arising, every thing receives the grace of purity, flowing and circulating without end. Knowing the beginning as without beginning, knowing the end as without end—through the Great One, it is called inexhaustible. If one knows there is a beginning, the three divisions are not severed. If the three divisions are not severed, the past becomes the beginning. Once the beginning has passed, the present is the middle. If the middle division does not abide, the future is the end. The end is yet to come, and with every encounter, the three divisions form. How can there be purity? Only when the three divisions are severed, the beginning is without beginning, and then the end is without end. Thus it is said: I enter the beginning and end of purity.\n\n*Commentary on the Precelestial Classic of Dao and Virtue*, Scroll Five, concludes.",
