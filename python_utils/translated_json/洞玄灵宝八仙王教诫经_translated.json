  "full_translation": "**The Scripture of the Eight Immortal Kings’ Teachings from the Cavernous Mystery and Numinous Treasure**\n\nThus spake the Dao:\n\nAt the inception of the perfected forms of the Left, Right, and Central Realms, they emerged from the transformative qi of the Primordial and Supreme Great Dao, gestating within the numinous jade womb for ninety thousand great kalpas in profound stillness and boundless solitude. After ninety thousand kalpas, by dharma’s decree, they were to manifest in the world, shaping form and ordering qi, emerging from the jade womb.\n\nAt the moment of their birth, the nine heavens thundered, and the nine earths split asunder. With their first steps, they ascended the Treasures of Heaven; their flower-like bodies radiated golden light, resplendent as the dawn’s twin suns, their crystalline eyes gleaming with brilliance. Upon their backs shone the Dipper’s stars, before their hearts the sun’s image; their hair was verdant, their teeth even, and purple qi trailed into the heavens. Wherever they dwelled, clouds of the Seven Essences shaded them morn and eve, while hidden dragons and circular lotuses formed their thrones. Heavenly lamps and candles illuminated the cloud-paths, celestial music and hymns resounded in myriad harmonies. Dragons and phoenixes kept time, singing odes to Great Peace, their melodies harmonious and refined, dazzling the eyes and ears. Sweet springs and wells cured all ailments; their forms were like gold and jade, free from decay or aging. Abiding in effortless harmony, they endured for ninety thousand kalpas.\n\nAt that time, the Three Perfected Ones transformed into infant boys, entrusted to a true mother, gradually growing and maturing with the world. The Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Supreme Great Dao bestowed upon these Three Perfected Ones the title **True Kings of Utmost Filial Piety**. They governed the Central Kingdom, extending their influence to the four barbarian realms, so that all living beings came to receive their teachings—cultivating compassion and filial piety, revering Heaven and submitting to Earth, preserving the One Precious Form, and cherishing all creatures.\n\nAfter thirty-three hundred years, they renewed their transformation, refining impurities through the trials of water and fire. Then the Three Perfected Filial Kings governed thus: the first in the sun’s midst, the second in the moon’s, and the third within the Dipper. Above, they upheld the Three Luminaries, their radiance illuminating the darkest nights; below, they governed the Three Qi, harmonizing the obscure and the manifest. Their responses were instantaneous, unsummoned, like shadows following form, unprompted by thought. Though dwelling in the upper realms, their Dao extended to the lower worlds—boundless, without above or below, edge or limit. Adapting their teachings to all directions, they delivered beings of every kind, uniting them in shared goodness, their minds free from doubt or error.\n\nTheir filial devotion was lofty and far-reaching, their divine power unmatched, capable of revolving Heaven and turning Earth, commanding yin and yang. They governed the span of kalpas, summoning and directing the thousand spirits, evoking auspicious omens, soaring without wings. In the blink of an eye—within the time it takes to flex or extend a limb—they traversed ten thousand heavens, all through the power of utmost filial piety.\n\nCompassion and obedience to one’s parents, mercy toward all growing things—this is the filial Dao. To cherish life and abhor killing, to abstain from meat and wine—this is the filial Dao. Lewdness and defilement between men and women, the impurities of childbirth and decaying corpses—these are not the filial Dao. Harm and bloodshed, theft and robbery—these are not the filial Dao. Indulging in wickedness, discoursing on evil—these are not the filial Dao. Delighting in filth and baseness, polluting inner and outer, neglecting the body’s cultivation through laziness, lacking steadfast faith, given to frivolity and waywardness, drifting with circumstances, failing to guard the One with wisdom—such scattered qi and mind lead to birth, aging, sickness, and death, to endless afflictions. Upon death, one falls into hell, suffering for kalpas without end. All this arises from losing the filial Dao and reaping its bitter fruits.\n\nMen and women of later generations who cultivate this filial Dao shall share in the Dao’s virtue. Having shared in its virtue, they shall share in its radiance. Having shared in its radiance, they shall share in its reality. Having shared in its reality, they shall share in its form. Having shared in its form, they shall share in its spirit. Having shared in its spirit, they shall share in its transformations. Having shared in its transformations, they shall share in its longevity. Having shared in its longevity, they shall share in its being. Having shared in its being, they shall share in its non-being. Having shared in its non-being, there is nowhere that is not without. Nowhere without being, yet nowhere not being—this is the serenity of emptiness. Nowhere not being, yet responding to the heart’s intent—this is the spontaneity of transformation.\n\nSome may become emperors, others loyal ministers, sages, or filial sons; some may become Daoist adepts or national preceptors, dwelling in cold forests, practicing austerities, reciting scriptures, and cultivating merit. Others may become valiant generals, triumphing without battle, or amass grain and silk to relieve the hungry and cold. Some may become enlightened masters, curing all manner of diseases and plagues, benefiting all living beings. Others may light lamps to illuminate the long night, or condense ten thousand kalpas into one, or extend a single kalpa into a hundred. From the tip of a hair, they may raise vast lands; within a single pore, they may contain the nine great rivers and the four seas, undisturbing the nature of things, unperceived and unknown. They may draw the worlds of the ten directions into a single needle’s point, aligning them before their eyes.\n\nAll living beings before them behold the Three Perfected Ones’ dharma-bodies of light and qi, expounding the Dharma in myriad ways, each attaining understanding and upholding the filial Dao. They enter the inconceivable, perform the inconceivable—yet those who lose the filial Dao are left helpless to save themselves, bound in the endless cycle of birth and death, beyond all reckoning.\n\nThose who uphold the filial Dao attain the fruit of fearlessness:\nFirst, they transcend the terror of birth and death, attaining the fruit of neither birth nor death.\nSecond, they transcend the terror of darkness and obstruction, attaining the fruit of radiant light—by day, the light of divine illumination; by night, the lamps of Heaven. In time, their bodies themselves radiate light, unceasing day or night.\nThird, they transcend the terror of hunger and cold, attaining the fruit of Heaven’s Kitchen and Heaven’s Robes.\nFourth, they transcend the terror of trials, so that all demon kings and fierce beasts come to serve and guard them.\n\nFifth, they transcend the terror of form, attaining the fruit of formlessness. To attain the fruit of formlessness—does this not mean the dissolution of life and the return to primordial form? Even this ordinary body may become a body of the Dao, its form merging with radiant qi, ascending into formlessness, one with the void. Thus is it called the attainment of the fruit of formlessness. High or low, they move as they will; gathered or scattered, they follow the heart’s intent. Being and nonbeing lie within their thought, and all is accomplished without need of body or mind.\n\nWhen filial piety governs the world, no laws are labored over. When filial piety governs the self, will and nature stand firm and upright. When filial piety governs the hundred diseases, Heaven itself becomes the physician. When filial piety governs the ten thousand things, no poison can harm. When filial piety governs mountains and rivers, grasses and trees never wither. When filial piety nurtures livelihood, fields and silkworms yield ten thousandfold. When filial piety reaches Heaven, wind and rain come in their season. When filial piety reaches Earth, the ten thousand kinds rest in tranquility. Divine mushrooms and numinous trees appear everywhere as auspicious signs. When filial piety reaches birds and beasts, dragons, unicorns, phoenixes, and luan-birds soar and gather within the borders. When filial piety reaches deep pools and marshes, river lords offer pearls, fish and dragons leap and surge, and waves grow still. Simply by being filial to one’s parents, one repays their boundless, primal kindness. The spirits of Heaven and Earth and the ten thousand numina attend morning and night as guards. Practicing the Dao and guarding unity, one naturally attains the Dao.\n\nFilial piety is the greatest of all Ways, coeval with the Primordial, governing the Three Luminaries, illuminating the darkest nights. All living kinds depend upon it without end.\n\nThen the Divine Youth bowed his head and ventured to ask the Heavenly Worthy: If those born in the lower world suffer the misfortune of losing their parents too soon, how may their filial hearts find expression?\n\nThe answer came: Reverence Heaven and comply with Earth; pay homage to the Three Luminaries as you would to your parents—there is no difference. Thus the attainment of the Dao is hastened, and all wishes follow the heart’s desire.\n\nTo comply with Earth is to follow the royal qi, to pay homage to the Five Peaks, to attend to the needs of the body. Do not offend the Grand Year; follow the four seasons. Cultivate the Way of daily renewal, observe the eight solar terms, request life and repent of transgressions. Within and without, be fragrant and pure; bare your heart and expose your innermost thoughts. Let the incense of sincerity rise of itself. Wash away flowing filth, refine and refine again, yet still fear it is not refined enough. Be true and ever more true, yet still fear it is not true enough. Taking the untrue for true, seeking the true Dao—demonic beings will respond, and sudden ruin will follow. Entering the demonic path, the hun and po are seized, madness and confusion arise. One may devise a single method, sell the essentials of the Dao for profit, amassing wealth and piling up sins. The body suffers punishment in life, and at death one falls into hell, enduring boiling cauldrons and scorching coals without end. Even if one escapes to be reborn, one may fall into the six paths of beasts, never as one wishes—born lowly, blind, deaf, mute, or maimed, forever barred from seeing the Dao, forever barred from hearing the Dharma, cast out by humans and beasts alike, suffering hunger, cold, and hardship, life hanging by a thread. To lose the great Dao once is to sink forever into evil destinies, beyond all reckoning.\n\nThe Dao says: Those of virtue, whose filial hearts soar high, unite with Heaven and Earth. Thus Heaven cannot kill them, and the Dao cannot be destroyed. Thus Earth cannot bury them—like burying frost-jade, it only becomes a relic, indestructible. They ascend to Heaven and enter Earth without hindrance.\n\nIn times past, there was one who knew not the great Dao, who feared death and clung to life. Morning and night, with upright thought, he paid homage to a withered tree, seeking immortality, and so he practiced for forty years. The great Dao, moved by his unrelenting diligence, saved his Dao-qi. Thus the withered tree one day burst into bloom. Overjoyed, the man redoubled his efforts, plucked and consumed its blossoms, and his body attained the Dao.\n\nThose who cultivate the Dao must never slacken, accumulating merit and virtue, their hearts and conduct renewed daily. Divine lamps, divine incense, divine light, and divine powers—these are the signs of the Dao. With unflagging resolve, the Dao descends to them, teaching its true essentials, and this is never in vain.\n\nThe Dao says: In the degenerate world below, when the vulgar see the subtle proofs of the Dao, they seek to exploit them. They scheme to take others’ offerings for their own private use, and so fall prey to demonic forces, never attaining the Dao. Stingy and greedy, they abandon the Way of compassion, lacking filial and obedient hearts. Practicing the Dao for profit only increases their deceit and falsehood. The sin of deceit and falsehood is unforgivable by Heaven and Earth.\n\nThose who study the Dao must not dwell with such people. They should rebuke them, expose their faults, cast them out, and punish them. Do not permit false repentance. When others of the Dao-stream are found guilty, confiscate their ill-gotten gains to aid the poor and sick. Do not defile sacred merit with tainted wealth.\n\nThe Dao says: When filial piety governs halls and chambers, adorn and maintain the pure dwellings—let no decay or damage appear. Common men and women, base and foul-smelling, covered in sores, filth, and warts, who squander their wealth on wine and lust, who eat fish and meat, who consume pungent and rank foods—forever bar them from entry. Do not associate with them, nor allow them near the kitchens for fasting rites.\n\nThe Dao says: There are ten evils and five rebellions, unfilial acts, secret malice, slander, and defamation that destroy the good Dao. Jealousy, arrogance, greed, lust, and love of wine; fondness for fish and meat; hunting and killing; theft and banditry; following demonic ways; hearts without compassion or filial piety; minds lacking equanimity; abandoning the poor to fawn over the rich; delighting in mockery and ridicule; indulging in strife and battle; practicing with weapons; lacking forbearance; seeking profit at the expense of others—these are what filial piety abhors, what humans and beasts alike fear. They are unfit to hear the Dao and should be shunned, never drawn near.\n\nThe Most High Great Dao expounds these teachings and admonitions for the enlightened kings of the lower world to govern with filial piety, for all filial children to repay their parents’ boundless, primal kindness. Let these principles guide families and nations, bringing the world to great peace, uniting the eight directions as one, all following utmost filial piety. Those who attain this should recite and uphold it morning and night, regardless of gender, status, or rank. Let all study and recite it to repay the boundless, primal kindness of their parents.\n\nAs this scripture was expounded, Heaven manifested divine lamps, illuminating all places with brightness. Heavenly bells and heavenly chimes, heavenly hymns and heavenly music sounded of themselves in the void. Heavenly incense and heavenly flowers drifted on the wind. In every family and nation, all people made offerings to this scripture.\n\nReflecting upon its meaning and intent, one should practice its teachings and encourage those who have not yet heard. Those who put it to use should prepare fine paper and brushes, purify themselves through bathing, and burn incense while copying it—whether a thousand scrolls or a hundred—circulating and making offerings to it without cease. With lamps and incense ever-present and the heart free from weariness, one will surely attain the Dao, in ways beyond all conception.\n\n*The Dongxuan Lingbao Scripture of the Eight Immortals’ Teachings and Admonitions* concludes.",

Practicing the Dao and guarding unity, one naturally attains the Dao.\n\nFilial piety is the greatest of all Ways, coeval with the Primordial, governing the Three Luminaries, illuminating the darkest nights. All living kinds depend upon it without end.\n\nThen the Divine Youth bowed his head and ventured to ask the Heavenly Worthy: If those born in the lower world suffer the misfortune of losing their parents too soon, how may their filial hearts find expression?\n\nThe answer came: Reverence Heaven and comply with Earth; pay homage to the Three Luminaries as you would to your parents—there is no difference. Thus the attainment of the Dao is hastened, and all wishes follow the heart’s desire.\n\nTo comply with Earth is to follow the royal qi, to pay homage to the Five Peaks, to attend to the needs of the body. Do not offend the Grand Year; follow the four seasons. Cultivate the Way of daily renewal, observe the eight solar terms, request life and repent of transgressions. Within and without, be fragrant and pure; bare your heart and expose your innermost thoughts. Let the incense of sincerity rise of itself. Wash away flowing filth, refine and refine again, yet still fear it is not refined enough. Be true and ever more true, yet still fear it is not true enough. Taking the untrue for true, seeking the true Dao—demonic beings will respond, and sudden ruin will follow. Entering the demonic path, the hun and po are seized, madness and confusion arise. One may devise a single method, sell the essentials of the Dao for profit, amassing wealth and piling up sins. The body suffers punishment in life, and at death one falls into hell, enduring boiling cauldrons and scorching coals without end. Even if one escapes to be reborn, one may fall into the six paths of beasts, never as one wishes—born lowly, blind, deaf, mute, or maimed, forever barred from seeing the Dao, forever barred from hearing the Dharma, cast out by humans and beasts alike, suffering hunger, cold, and hardship, life hanging by a thread. To lose the great Dao once is to sink forever into evil destinies, beyond all reckoning.\n\nThe Dao says: Those of virtue, whose filial hearts soar high, unite with Heaven and Earth. Thus Heaven cannot kill them, and the Dao cannot be destroyed. Thus Earth cannot bury them—like burying frost-jade, it only becomes a relic, indestructible. They ascend to Heaven and enter Earth without hindrance.\n\nIn times past, there was one who knew not the great Dao, who feared death and clung to life. Morning and night, with upright thought, he paid homage to a withered tree, seeking immortality, and so he practiced for forty years. The great Dao, moved by his unrelenting diligence, saved his Dao-qi. Thus the withered tree one day burst into bloom. Overjoyed, the man redoubled his efforts, plucked and consumed its blossoms, and his body attained the Dao.\n\nThose who cultivate the Dao must never slacken, accumulating merit and virtue, their hearts and conduct renewed daily. Divine lamps, divine incense, divine light, and divine powers—these are the signs of the Dao. With unflagging resolve, the Dao descends to them, teaching its true essentials, and this is never in vain.\n\nThe Dao says: In the degenerate world below, when the vulgar see the subtle proofs of the Dao, they seek to exploit them. They scheme to take others’ offerings for their own private use, and so fall prey to demonic forces, never attaining the Dao. Stingy and greedy, they abandon the Way of compassion, lacking filial and obedient hearts. Practicing the Dao for profit only increases their deceit and falsehood. The sin of deceit and falsehood is unforgivable by Heaven and Earth.\n\nThose who study the Dao must not dwell with such people. They should rebuke them, expose their faults, cast them out, and punish them. Do not permit false repentance. When others of the Dao-stream are found guilty, confiscate their ill-gotten gains to aid the poor and sick. Do not defile sacred merit with tainted wealth.\n\nThe Dao says: When filial piety governs halls and chambers, adorn and maintain the pure dwellings—let no decay or damage appear. Common men and women, base and foul-smelling, covered in sores, filth, and warts, who squander their wealth on wine and lust, who eat fish and meat, who consume pungent and rank foods—forever bar them from entry. Do not associate with them, nor allow them near the kitchens for fasting rites.\n\nThe Dao says: There are ten evils and five rebellions, unfilial acts, secret malice, slander, and defamation that destroy the good Dao. Jealousy, arrogance, greed, lust, and love of wine; fondness for fish and meat; hunting and killing; theft and banditry; following demonic ways; hearts without compassion or filial piety; minds lacking equanimity; abandoning the poor to fawn over the rich; delighting in mockery and ridicule; indulging in strife and battle; practicing with weapons; lacking forbearance; seeking profit at the expense of others—these are what filial piety abhors, what humans and beasts alike fear. They are unfit to hear the Dao and should be shunned, never drawn near.\n\nThe Most High Great Dao expounds these teachings and admonitions for the enlightened kings of the lower world to govern with filial piety, for all filial children to repay their parents’ boundless, primal kindness. Let these principles guide families and nations, bringing the world to great peace, uniting the eight directions as one, all following utmost filial piety. Those who attain this should recite and uphold it morning and night, regardless of gender, status, or rank. Let all study and recite it to repay the boundless, primal kindness of their parents.\n\nAs this scripture was expounded, Heaven manifested divine lamps, illuminating all places with brightness. Heavenly bells and heavenly chimes, heavenly hymns and heavenly music sounded of themselves in the void. Heavenly incense and heavenly flowers drifted on the wind. In every family and nation, all people made offerings to this scripture.",
