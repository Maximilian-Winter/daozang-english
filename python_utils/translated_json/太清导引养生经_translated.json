  "full_translation": "**The Supreme Clarity Scripture on Guiding and Nurturing Life**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Supreme Clarity Scripture on Guiding and Nurturing Life*. Author unknown. One scroll. Base text from *The Orthodox Daoist Canon*, *Methods* section of the *Dongshen* Department.\n\n**Collated Editions:**\n1. Partial content included in *The Seven Bamboo Tablets of the Cloudy Satchel*, Volume 34.\n2. Excerpts compiled in *Essential Extracts from the Daoist Canon* under *Ancient Immortal Methods of Guiding and Massage*, included in the third collection.\n\n---\n\n### **The Supreme Clarity Scripture on Guiding and Nurturing Life**\n**Cautious Practice of Internal Methods**\n\n**Chisongzi** was the Rain Master during the time of Shennong. He could ascend and descend with the wind and remained alive until the era of Gaoxin. His daily practice began at dawn: he would spread a mat facing east, first interlock his hands above his head, and pull his head to the ground, performing five *weng* breaths and five exhalations to dispel bloating and qi.\n\nNext, he would cover his head with his right hand while pressing his left elbow to the ground, stretching fully, then reverse the motion—covering with the left hand and pressing the right elbow to the ground—five times each, exhaling to cease, thus guiding the sinews and bones.\n\nThen, placing both hands on his right knee and lifting to the waist, he would raise his head after extreme stretching, pausing for five breaths to guide the waist.\n\nNext, his left hand would press his waist and left knee while his right hand stretched upward, then reversing—right hand on waist and right knee, left hand stretching upward—each for five breaths to guide the heart and abdomen.\n\nThen, his left hand would press his waist while his right hand stretched upward, reversing the motion with the right hand on the waist and left hand stretching upward, five breaths each, to guide the center of the abdomen.\n\nNext, interlocking his hands before his chest and ribs, he would shake his head left and right without ceasing until fully extended, thus guiding the face and ears to prevent perverse qi from entering.\n\nThen, placing both hands below his waist, he would sway left and right until fully extended, circulating the blood and vessels.\n\nNext, interlocking his hands, he would stretch fully, pulling left and right at the shoulders.\n\nThen, interlocking his hands and reversing them above his head, he would adjust left and right to guide the lungs and liver.\n\nNext, interlocking his hands before his chest, he would stretch fully left and right to expel vexing qi from the skin.\n\nThen, interlocking his hands left and right, he would lift his shoulders to guide the skin, standing and swaying to pull the two channels, dispelling leg qi.\n\nThe above is **Chisongzi’s Method of Guiding**, which eliminates the hundred diseases, prolongs life, and augments longevity. This should be practiced daily over time for benefit.\n\n**Master Ning** was a man of the Yellow Emperor’s time. As a pottery master, he could accumulate fire to burn himself and ascend or descend with the smoke, his clothes never scorched. His practice began between midnight and noon: facing east with unbound hair, he would clench his fists and hold his breath for one cycle, then raise his hands to guide left and right. Covering his ears with his hands prevented his hair from turning white. External guiding was performed three times, pressing the vessels beside his neck with his fingers three times to brighten his eyes.\n\nFacing east while seated, he would hold his breath for two cycles, then press his mouth with his middle fingers, spitting saliva fourteen times, rubbing and wiping his eyes to brighten them.\n\nFacing east while seated, he would hold his breath for three cycles, pinching his nostrils to cure chronic nasal polyps.\n\nFacing east while seated, he would hold his breath for four cycles, clicking his teeth without count, then prostrating forward and lying on his side, holding his breath for six cycles to cure deafness and dizziness.\n\nTurning outward, he would hold his breath for seven cycles to cure chest pain and coughing.\n\nHugging his knees and stretching upward from the ground, he would hold his breath for eight cycles to cure heat and perverse qi from the chest to the head, neck, ears, eyes, throat, and nose.\n\nRemoving his pillow, clenching his fists, and stretching upward from the ground while holding his breath for nine cycles, facing east to allow qi to circulate up and down, gently inhaling through the nose, cured emaciation.\n\nThose unable to follow yin-yang methods should not practice during major yin periods.\n\n**Toad Qi-Guiding Method:** Sit upright, swaying both arms without ceasing for twelve cycles to cure fatigue.\n\nLie on the left or right side, holding the breath for twelve cycles to dissolve phlegm and stagnant fluids. If the right side is afflicted, lie on the right; if the left, lie on the left. Expel undissolved qi.\n\nAt sunrise, noon, and sunset, face the sun and stand upright, holding the breath for nine cycles. Tilt the head back to absorb the sun’s essence, swallowing nine times to augment essence a hundredfold.\n\n**Fire-Entering Method (Arms Dangling Without Breathing to Avoid Fire Injury):**\nFacing south, squat with hands reaching through the bent knees to grasp the toes, curling them inward to benefit the waist and cure urinary blockage and incontinence.\n\nSitting with legs spread and feet crossed, hands placed inside the feet, then interlocking hands and stretching fully, cured nocturnal emissions and prevented leakage of essence and qi.\n\nInterlocking hands beneath the chin and stretching fully benefited lung qi and cured sudden coughing.\n\nLifting both feet to the sides of the cheeks, hands pressing the ground, cured chronic congestion.\n\nLifting the right hand and extending the left, sitting with the right foot covering the left, cured corpse-like pain.\n\nRaising hands to clasp the neck and stretching fully cured pain beneath the ribs.\n\nExtending the left hand while the right hand grasped the left thumb and stretched fully, then reversing—extending the right hand while the left grasped the right thumb and stretched fully—cured aching bones and joints.\n\nCovering both feet with hands, fingers pressing the toes, cured a broken waist unable to bend or lift, and long-standing blood stasis.\n\nStiffening the toes cured lumbar and spinal pain preventing backward glances.\n\nBringing the right hand from above the head downward while pulling the lower hand cured neck stiffness preventing backward glances.\n\nSitting on the ground, covering the left hand while the right hand pulled the shoulder, cured slanted knees, lumbar pain, and urinary blockage.\n\nFacing east while seated toward the sun, the left hand saluting the moon, lifting the body to gaze at the Northern Dipper, and absorbing the moon’s qi prevented the entry of all malign influences and cured head and neck stiffness.\n\nPulling the right hand backward and stretching fully, drawing the bow left and right, supplemented the five viscera’s insufficient qi. Finally, hugging both knees to the chest and stretching fully regularly returned the qi of the cinnabar field to supplement the brain.\n\nSeated on the ground with legs stretched straight, grasp the meridians of the feet with the hands and lower the head to the ground, aligning the vertebrae of the spine to nourish the hair roots, making them long and beautiful.\n\nSeated on the ground with legs crossed, thread both hands through the bent legs, lower the head, and interlock the fingers behind the neck to cure chronic cold that leaves one unable to warm oneself. If hearing is impaired, do not correct it; if sounds persist, do not cease.\n\nCirculating qi from the head to the soles of the feet cures carbuncles, scabs, leprosy, hemiplegia, and all forms of numbness.\n\nVigorously shake both arms to the right without breathing for nine cycles to cure arm pain, fatigue, and wind-qi that does not follow its course.\n\n**Tortoise and Softshell Turtle Qi-Circulation Method:**\nCover the mouth and nose with clothing, hold the breath for nine cycles, then exhale slightly through the nose to cure nasal congestion.\n\n**Facing east while seated**, tilt the head back and hold the breath for five cycles, stir the saliva in the mouth with the tongue until it fills twice seven measures, then swallow to cure dry mouth and bitter tongue.\n\n**Wild Goose Qi-Circulation Method:**\nLower the head and lean on the arms, hold the breath for twelve cycles, and with intention, expel stagnant fluids and retained food from the lower body to cure oneself.\n\n**Dragon Qi-Circulation Method:**\nBow the head and look downward, hold the breath for twelve cycles to cure wind rashes, malignant sores, and prevent heat from entering the throat.\n\nTo examine a patient, face the sun, lie down clearly, massage the abdomen down to the feet, grasp and pull the feet, lower the arms twelve times, and hold the breath for twelve cycles to cure cold numbness in the feet preventing walking and lumbar pain.\n\nInterlock the fingers behind the neck to cure unrelenting poison, and if there is great qi in the abdomen, induce vomiting.\n\nAt the beginning, middle, and end of the lunar month, face the moon and stand upright, hold the breath for eight cycles, tilt the head back to absorb the moon’s essence, and swallow eight times to strengthen yin qi. Women who absorb this will enhance their yin essence, facilitating the path to childbirth.\n\n**Method to Prevent Drowning When Entering Water with Arms Raised:**\nFace north, sit with legs spread like a winnowing basket, grasp the toes with the hands to cure atrophy of the thigh muscles and corpse-like tendon stiffness.\n\nSit urgently with legs spread, thread both hands through the bent legs, press the ground with the bent legs, place the hands on them, and lift the body to circulate qi, curing strangury and breast pain.\n\nCross the feet over the neck, place both hands on the ground, lift the body, and hold the breath to the utmost to cure abdominal fullness and sorrow, expel the three worms, benefit the five viscera, and invigorate the spirit.\n\nSquat with both hands lifting the feet, stretch the legs to the utmost horizontally to cure qi surging, swelling, and pain, cold diseases entering above and below, and to restore kidney qi.\n\nSquat with both hands grasping the toes, lower the head to the utmost, so that the qi of the five viscera converges, curing deafness and blurred vision. Prolonged practice will reverse gray hair to black.\n\nLie flat on the back, clench the fists, hold the breath, press the heels, and grip the grove to cure yin bind, numbness, and atrophy of the sinews and scrotum.\n\nPlace both hands under the armpits while squatting to cure chest fullness, dizziness, and withered hands.\n\nPress both hands on the knees, tilt the head back, and imitate the turtle drawing in qi to guide the great primordial qi to the cinnabar field, eliminating lumbar and spinal pain.\n\nVigorously pinch the nostrils with the thumbs without breathing, directing qi upward to the mud-pill palace in the brain, ensuring the harmonious flow of yin and yang without fatigue.\n\nGrasp the hair tightly with the left hand and press the back of the neck with the right hand, allowing blood and qi to flow to their roots, closing the great yang qi to prevent yin overflow—this truly clarifies the Dao of yin and yang.\n\nSit upright with both hands crossed behind the back, called \"binding the sash,\" to cure constipation, benefit the abdomen, and cure emaciation.\n\nSeated on the ground with both hands crossed beneath, to cure yin fullness.\n\nGrasp a rope and hang upside down like a donkey, with the feet above, to cure dizziness, wind-induced epilepsy, and convulsions.\n\nPull with both hands, place them on the back, and hang from a rope to cure lack of focus and difficulty swallowing food.\n\nPull the rope upward with one hand while grasping the foot with the other to cure chronic corpse-like hemorrhoids and swelling.\n\nSeated on the ground with legs stretched straight, interlock the fingers, pull the feet to the utmost to cure the inability of the intestines to receive food and vomiting.\n\nMaster Xiao said: Those who wish to practice Dao-yin and circulate qi to eliminate the hundred diseases and prevent aging should always keep in mind the returning cinnabar to the cinnabar field. The cinnabar that gives life to humans is the returning that saves them; when complete, it extends years, when lost, it leads to decay. Therefore, Dao-yin expels all perverse qi from the limbs, bones, and joints, preserving the upright qi. Those who practice with sincerity and diligence, integrating it into their daily actions and speech, practicing day and night, will strengthen their bones and joints, curing the hundred diseases. If suddenly afflicted by wind stroke, chronic malaria, paralysis, deafness, head convulsions, coughing with counterflow qi, or lumbar pain, one may consult the illustrations, locate the ailment, circulate qi, and practice Dao-yin, using intention to expel and eliminate it. Circulating qi can supplement the internal, while Dao-yin can cure the four limbs. This is the natural Dao; only through diligent practice can one preserve harmony with heaven and earth.\n\n**Pengzu’s External Qi-Circulation Method:**\nPengzu was a minister of the Yin dynasty, living through the Xia and Shang, numbering seven hundred years. He regularly consumed cassia and attained the Dao. He often removed his clothing and coverings, stretched his waist, filled his lower abdomen, and held his breath for five cycles to guide the kidneys, curing wasting-thirst and benefiting yin and yang.\n\nHe also said: Extend the left leg, bend the right knee, and press inward for five cycles to guide the spleen, curing cold and heat in the heart and abdomen, and chest distension.\n\nPull the toes of both feet for five cycles to guide the abdomen, curing mounting and conglomerations, and benefiting the nine orifices.\n\nPoint both feet upward for five cycles to guide the lumbar spine, curing numbness and hemiplegia, and restoring hearing.\n\nTurn the soles of both feet inward to face each other for five cycles to guide the heart and lungs, curing coughing with counterflow qi.\n\nBring the heels inward to face each other for five cycles to guide the thighs, dispelling qi from the five collaterals, benefiting the intestines and stomach, and expelling pathogenic qi.\n\nCover the left meridian, bend the right knee, and press inward for five cycles to guide the lungs, dispelling wind and deficiency, and brightening the eyes.\n\nStretch the meridians and pull the toes of both feet for five cycles to prevent cramps.\n\nPull both knees with the hands and place them on the chest for five cycles to cure lumbar pain.\n\nRotate both feet outward ten times, then inward ten times, ceasing to restore from all fatigue.\n\nThe external guiding method of Pengzu’s Valley Immortal dispels the hundred diseases and is essential for prolonging life and preserving health.\n\nIn all, ten movements and fifty breaths—five times fifty makes two hundred and fifty breaths.\n\nFor Daoist guiding, practice regularly from midnight to the crowing of the pheasant at dawn, avoiding full meals and bathing.\n\nThe Eight Spirit Daoist Guiding Method of Prince Qiao prolongs life, benefits longevity, and dispels the hundred diseases. The method states: The pillow should be four inches high, the feet five inches apart, and the hands three inches from the body. Remove clothing and unbound hair, lie flat on the back, and empty the mind of all thoughts. Calm the intent, then slowly inhale through the nose and exhale through the mouth, directing the breath to each organ in turn, repeating the cycle without end. To rest, first exhale fully and cease, without forcing prolonged breaths. With long practice, the breath will naturally lengthen. Let the coming and going of qi be so subtle that neither ear nor nose perceives it. Refine and concentrate it, then extend it gradually. The thighs and calves should remain still, with moderation prized. Whether faintly present or absent, perform this a hundred times. When the abdomen moves and qi resonates, and an external sound is heard in the feet, success is achieved. For those who attain success, what illness remains?\n\nThe throat resembles a silver ring, twelve layers thick, striking the chest to reach the lungs. Their color is white and lustrous, the front two lobes higher and the rear two lower. The heart strikes beneath them, broad above and tapering below, its crimson hue like a lotus bud yet to open, inverted and attached to the lungs. The liver connects below, its color a true green, like the head of a turtle dove. Its six lobes embrace the stomach, the front two higher and the rear four lower. The gallbladder connects beneath, resembling a green silk pouch. The spleen lies at the center, its golden-yellow hue gleaming like molten metal. The kidneys resemble two crouching rats, flanking the spine and aligned with the navel, desiring elevation. Their color is a true black, enveloped in fat and vessels, their white and black distinct. The stomach resembles a plain sack; envision its folds curving to the right, free from filth and decay.\n\nThe liver stores the hun-soul, the lungs store the po-soul, the heart stores the spirit, the spleen stores the intent, and the kidneys store essence—these are called the abodes of the spirits. When the abodes of the spirits are cultivated, the hundred vessels harmonize, and pathogenic diseases have no place to reside.\n\nThe small intestine is nine feet long, corresponding to the nine provinces. Another account says nine lands. The large intestine is twenty-four feet long.\n\nFor all Daoist guiding: those with deficiency should close their eyes, while those with excess should keep them open. Perform the guiding for the afflicted area without using the seventh breath. Move slowly back and forth for about two hundred steps, then sit and swallow qi five or six times. If the condition does not improve, repeat the method until cured.\n\nFor all ailments, lie flat on the back, unbound hair as prescribed, and slowly inhale through the mouth to fill the abdomen. Exert to the utmost until breath is nearly cut off, then slowly exhale through the nose. Repeat dozens of times. For deficiency, supplement; for excess, drain. Close the mouth, warm the qi, and swallow it thirty times. When the abdomen rumbles, cease. Walk back and forth for two hundred steps. If not cured, repeat the method.\n\nFor ailments in the throat or chest, raise the pillow seven inches. For ailments below the heart, raise the pillow four inches. For ailments below the navel, remove the pillow. Inhaling through the mouth and exhaling through the nose is called *supplementing*; closing the mouth, warming the qi, and swallowing it is called *draining*.\n\nMethod for treating all diseases by breath-holding:\nTo guide ailments of the head, tilt the head back.\nTo guide ailments of the waist and feet, point the toes upward.\nTo guide ailments of the chest, pull the toes.\nTo guide ailments of the arms, cover the arms.\nTo dispel cold, heat, or discomfort in the abdomen, or if afflicted by cold with fever, hold the breath and distend the abdomen. When needing to breathe, exhale slowly through the nose. Repeat until cured.\n\n1. Sit upright, straighten the waist, legs, and arms, place hands palms-down on the ground, and slowly inhale through the mouth and exhale through the nose to dispel pain in the chest and lungs. Warm the qi by swallowing, and close the eyes.\n\n2. Sit upright, straighten the waist, and tilt the head forward and backward thirty times each. Inhale through the nose, hold the breath, and eliminate head deficiency and depletion. Turn the head while keeping the eyes closed.\n\n3. Sit upright, straighten the waist, and lean to the left side. Inhale through the mouth and exhale through the nose to dispel accumulations and discomfort below the heart.\n\n4. Sit upright, straighten the waist, and slowly inhale through the nose. Hold the nose with the right hand to dispel dim vision, eye pain, nasal polyps, and deafness. It also dispels cold damage, head cold, and headache with chills. Sweating indicates success.\n\n5. Lie flat on the back, slowly inhale through the mouth and exhale through the nose to dispel abdominal tension. After eating, swallow qi dozens of times to warm it. Cold causes dry retching and abdominal pain. Inhale through the mouth seventy times to fill the abdomen greatly.\n\n6. Lie on the right side, inhale through the nose, and swallow qi dozens of times through the mouth. Rub the hands together until warm, then massage the abdomen to guide the qi downward and expel it, dispelling pain in the rib-side skin. Cease after seven breaths.\n\n7. Sit upright, straighten the waist, raise the body, extend both arms, and turn the palms upward. Inhale through the nose and hold the breath to the utmost for seven cycles, ceasing when pain arises in the center. This is called the Terrace of the King of Shu, dispelling accumulations below the rib-side.\n\n8. Lie face-down without a pillow, stand on both feet, inhale through the nose sixteen times, then exhale through the nose, ensuring the breath enters subtly.\n\nWhen the breath reaches the center, ensure the nose does not perceive it, dispelling heat within the body and pain in the back.\n\n9. Sit upright, straighten the waist, raise the left hand with the palm facing upward, and withdraw the right hand, dispelling pain and knotted qi in both arms.\n\n10. Sit upright, clasp the hands together and hold the knees, hold the breath to distend the abdomen for fourteen or twenty-one cycles, then exhale when the qi is full, ensuring all qi flows smoothly. Practicing this for ten years, the old will retain a youthful appearance.\n\n11. Sit upright, straighten the waist, tilt left and right, close the eyes, inhale through the nose, dispelling head wind. Hold to the utmost, ceasing after seven breaths.\n\n12. If there is pain in the abdomen or discomfort from previous overeating, sit and straighten the waist, inhale through the mouth dozens of times until relief is felt. If not relieved, repeat. If there is cold qi and abdominal discomfort, practice this as well.\n\n13. Sit upright, extend both arms as if drawing a full bow to shoot, to treat vexation and oppression in the limbs and tension in the back. Practice this daily or as needed.\n\n14. Sit upright, straighten the waist, raise the right hand with the palm facing upward, support the left rib-side with the left hand, inhale through the nose, hold to the utmost for seven breaths, dispelling stomach cold and indigestion.\n\n15. Sit upright, straighten the waist, raise the left hand with the palm facing upward, support the right rib-side with the right hand, inhale through the nose, hold to the utmost for seven breaths, dispelling stagnant blood and knotted qi.\n\n16. Lean back with both hands supporting the body, tilt the head upward, inhale through the mouth, and swallow the qi dozens of times, dispelling heat in the body, internal injuries, and dead muscle.\n\n17. Lie flat on the back, fully extend the limbs, inhale through the nose, hold to the utmost for seven breaths, shake the feet thirty times and cease, dispelling cold in the chest and feet, and numbness or counterflow throughout the body.\n\n18. Lie on the back, bend the knees so the inner sides of the knees face each other, grasp the feet with the hands, straighten the waist, inhale through the mouth, fill the abdomen with counterflow qi, hold to the utmost for seven breaths, dispelling numbness, pain, heat, and paralysis in the feet.\n\n19. When the body feels dull and obstructed, perform Dao-yin: clasp the head with both hands and turn it up and down, called \"Opening the Rib-Side.\"\n\n20. Squat and extend the right foot, clasp the left knee with both hands, straighten the waist, inhale through the nose, hold to the utmost for seven breaths, dispelling difficulty in bending, stretching, bowing, or rising, pain in the brain, and stagnant numbness.\n\n21. Squat and extend the left foot, clasp the right knee with both hands, straighten the waist, inhale through the nose, hold to the utmost for seven breaths, then extend the left foot outward, dispelling difficulty in bending, stretching, bowing, or rising, and pain in the brain. Another version states it dispels wind, dim vision, and deafness.\n\n22. Lie flat on the back, straighten both feet, rub the perineum with both hands until it reddens like cinnabar wrapped in oil, dispelling dampness below the genitals, difficulty in urination, sagging, and heaviness in the lower abdomen.\n\nIf there is heat in the abdomen, simply inhale through the mouth and exhale through the nose dozens of times, without swallowing the qi. If the abdomen is not hot, hold the breath for seven cycles to warm the qi, then swallow it ten times.\n\n23. Squat, clasp both knees with both hands, inhale through the nose, hold to the utmost for seven breaths, dispelling numbness in the waist and pain in the back.\n\n24. Lie face-down, look toward both heels, straighten the waist, inhale through the nose, hold to the utmost for seven breaths, dispelling cramping pain, spasms, and soreness in the feet.\n\n25. Lie on the back, extend both hands outward, point the heels toward each other, inhale through the nose, hold to the utmost for seven breaths, dispelling cold in the knees and pain in the sinews and bones.\n\n26. Lie on the back, extend both feet and hands, point the heels toward each other, inhale through the nose, hold to the utmost for seven breaths, dispelling dead muscle, inability to lift the feet, and cold in the foot meridians.\n\n27. Lie on the back, extend both hands and feet, if the left side of the feet is swollen, inhale through the nose, hold to the utmost for seven breaths, dispelling bitterness in the stomach and vomiting.\n\n28. Squat, straighten the waist, grasp both heels with both hands, inhale through the nose, hold to the utmost for seven breaths, then place the hands on the knees, dispelling numbness and vomiting.\n\n29. Lie on the back, extend both hands and feet, point the toes upward, inhale through the nose, hold to the utmost for seven breaths, dispelling tension, urgency, and pain in the abdomen.\n\n30. Lie on the back, place the left heel against the right big toe, inhale through the nose, hold to the utmost for seven breaths, dispelling counterflow illness. If the feet are crossed, do not restrict to the big toe; follow the text accordingly.\n\n31. Lie on the back, place the right heel against the left big toe, inhale through the nose, hold to the utmost for seven breaths, dispelling numbness throughout the body.\n\n32. If the illness is on the left side, sit upright, straighten the waist, look to the left with the eyes, slowly inhale through the mouth and swallow the qi eleven times, then close the eyes and direct the gaze upward.\n\n33. If there is illness below the heart or accumulations, sit upright, straighten the waist, face the sun, tilt the head upward, slowly inhale through the mouth and swallow the qi thirty times, then open the eyes.\n\n34. If the illness is on the right side, sit upright, straighten the waist, look to the right with the eyes, slowly inhale through the mouth and swallow the qi dozens of times, then open the eyes.\n\n*Wang Qiao’s Dao-yin Diagram* is found within Peng Zu’s methods:\nFor seven days, extend the left foot, bend the right knee, press inward with it, hold for five breaths, drawing the spleen qi, dispelling cold and heat in the heart and abdomen, and distension in the chest.\n\n*Peng Zu’s Dao-yin Diagram*:\nPerform Dao-yin, ingest qi, loosen the hair, sit facing east, make fists, hold the breath for one cycle, raise the hands to guide left and right, cover the ears with the hands, tap the neck arteries with the fingers five times. This brightens the eyes, blackens the hair, and prevents it from turning white, treating head wind.\n\n*Method for Purging Qi*:\nThe method states: Every person’s five viscera each have their own qi. When externally closing the breath and sensing afterward, those who wish to ingest qi should first purge and turn over the old food and stale qi to expel them, then regulate and ingest the qi.\n\nHere is the translation:\n\n---\n\nIts method: Clench the fists tightly, raise both hands and press them against the space between the breasts, lift the knees to brace the back and body. Internally close the breath, inflate the qi in the *qi* sea, allowing it to emerge naturally from within. Turn and revolve it, then exhale with a *he* sound. Stop after one or two sets of nine. This completes the purging of qi, after which it is regulated.\n\nPerform Dao-yin, ingest qi, sit facing east, hold the breath for four cycles, and tap the teeth fourteen times to cure tooth decay and pain. Some say it treats bleeding gums without decay.\n\n*Method for Swallowing Qi*:\nAll people receive the primordial qi of Heaven and Earth to sustain life. With each swallow and exhalation, the internal qi harmonizes with the external qi. From the *qi* sea, it rises with the breath to the throat. At the moment of full exhalation, seal the mouth, swallow with a rolling motion, and force it down with a gurgling sound. It then descends along the left side through twenty-four nodes, like water flowing through rapids, distinctly audible. For women, it descends along the right side. Thus, the internal qi is consolidated, clearly differentiated. Guide it with intention, massage it with the hands, and hasten its descent into the *qi* sea. The *qi* sea is located three inches below the navel, also called the lower *dantian*. For beginners in qi ingestion, if the upper burner is not yet unblocked, massage to assist its swift descent. Once the qi flows freely, it descends without massage. With the mouth closed, swallow twice in succession—this is called \"cloud travel.\" A moist swallow, mixing saliva with the qi, is called \"rain bestowal.\" When ingesting qi internally, if the qi has not yet circulated day and night, perform this with each swallow. Do not hastily progress to consecutive swallows. After three years of practice, success is achieved.\n\nPerform Dao-yin, ingest qi, stand upright against a wall, hold the breath, and circulate qi from the head to the feet to cure carbuncles, scabs, *da feng*, hemiplegia, and all convulsions. Some say circulate qi from the feet upward to the head.\n\nPerform Dao-yin and ingest qi: First lie supine, close the mouth, and inflate the cheeks and abdomen until the mouth is full of qi. Swallow, directing the intention to guide it backward. Practice this morning and evening—it is wondrous.\n\nPerform Dao-yin and ingest qi: Squat in a corner, clasp the knees with both hands, lower the head, and hold the breath for nine cycles to cure neck pain and lumbar or leg ailments. Some say it treats fatigue, with other effects the same.\n\nPerform Dao-yin and ingest qi: Extend both arms left and right, hold the breath for nine cycles to cure arm pain, fatigue wind, unregulated qi, and blockages.\n\nPerform Dao-yin and ingest qi: Sit upright, face the sky, and exhale the qi of wine, food, drunkenness, or fullness to dispel hunger and sober the mind. This is suitable for summer practice, preventing cold and restlessness.\n\nPerform Dao-yin and ingest qi: Sit upright, inhale through the nose, guide the qi down to the navel, and exhale slowly through the mouth without holding the breath to dissolve accumulations. This is suitable for those who prefer heat in summer.\n\nPerform Dao-yin and ingest qi: Lower the head slightly, hold a gentle breath, clasp the hands left and right, and hold the breath for twelve cycles to aid digestion, lighten the body, boost vitality, and prevent pathogenic qi from entering. Alternatively, perform Dao-yin, ingest qi, or circulate qi while lowering the head and squatting, binding oneself with a rope. Lower the head and hold the breath for ten cycles to aid digestion and lighten the body.\n\nPerform Dao-yin: Regularly press outward with both hands as if lifting a thousand *jin* stone, alternating left and right. Practicing this throughout life prevents illness.\n\nPerform Dao-yin: Place both hands on the ground, retract the body, arch the spine, and lift upward three times. Practicing this daily brings supplementation, benefit, and longevity. When performing this, avoid wind, hold the breath, and after each ingestion, exhale without letting the ears hear. If fatigued, use swallowing and exhalation. For cold in the viscera, blow out the qi; for heat, exhale it out.\n\nPerform Dao-yin and ingest qi: Imitate the movement of a snake, hold the breath, lie supine, then rise and squat. Face the direction of the prevailing phase (*wang xiang*), hold the breath, eat lightly to ensure smoothness. Ingesting qi is the foundation, saliva is the broth. In spring, release; in winter, store. The *Hua Chi* and *Yu Jiang* are sweet as dates. Strive to practice without doubt. Another version says: In spring, generate; in summer, nourish; in winter, gather and store internally. Close the eyes to inner light—other details are the same.\n\n*Method for Exhaling Qi*:\nFor those contemplating qi, *he* pertains to the heart, which governs the tongue. For dry mouth, rough qi, or all pathogenic qi, use *he* to cure it. For great heat, open the mouth wide; for slight heat, open it slightly. Adjust according to need, but excessive practice will cause harm.\n\nFor those contemplating qi, *hu* pertains to the spleen, which governs the central palace of Earth. For mild heat, abdominal distension, fullness, or stagnant qi, use *hu* to cure it.\n\nFor those contemplating qi, *xu* pertains to the liver, which governs the eyes. For red, swollen eyes, use *xu* to cure them.\n\nFor those contemplating qi, *chui* pertains to the kidneys, which govern the ears. For cold in the waist and knees or decline of the yang path, use *chui* to cure it.\n\nFor those contemplating qi, *si* pertains to the lungs, which govern the nose. For disharmony of cold and heat, use *si* to cure it.\n\n*He*, *si*, *hu*, *xu*, *chui*, and *xi*—each of the five viscera governs one qi. For extreme fatigue, follow these principles to achieve immediate relief.\n\nThe method of Dao-yin: The outer mat should be elevated to prevent earth qi from rising and ghostly qi from interfering.\n\nThe method of Dao-yin: Avoid impatience and haste, which are thieves to the body.\n\nThe method of Dao-yin: Do not face north, as it reverses the spirit.

With time, one may converse with them, asking questions anywhere, north or south.\n\nThe above excerpts are collated from *Master Xiao’s Illustrated Dao-yin Variations* and *Daoist Grove’s Essential Dao-yin Principles*.\n\nLower the head, clasp both feet with both hands, and hold the breath for twelve cycles—this aids digestion, lightens the body, replenishes essence and qi, and prevents all malign influences and the hundred diseases from entering.\n\nSquat with knees together and feet apart, holding the breath for five cycles—this treats heat sores of the nose and mouth and the five types of hemorrhoids.\n\nSit with knees stacked, place both hands on the knees, stretch the waist fully, raise the head to draw in breath, and hold for three cycles—this treats skin ailments.\n\nSit cross-legged, interlock the hands above the head, bend forward to touch the ground with the crown, and hold the breath for five cycles—this naturally enhances qi and strength.\n\nKneel upright, bend the arms to clasp beneath the breasts—\n\nRock the left and right knees without ceasing—this extends lifespan, preserves youth, and prevents aging.\n\nClasp both knees to the chest with both hands and hold the breath for three cycles—this treats lumbar pain, kidney hernias, and backaches.\n\nSit in a wide straddle, grasp both feet with both hands and all five toes, bend forward to touch the ground, and hold the breath for twelve cycles—this treats pain in the neck, nape, waist, and back, and sharpens hearing and vision.\n\nSit cross-legged, cross the hands beneath the head, stretch fully, and hold the breath for six cycles—this treats lumbar pain that prevents turning to look back.\n\nTilt the head back, massage the abdomen with the hands, grasp the feet to lift the soles from the dust, and hold the breath for twelve cycles—this treats knee numbness that impedes walking and lumbar or back pain.\n\nExtend both legs, place both hands on the toes—this treats lumbar pain as if broken, as well as stagnant and congealed blood.\n\nBend both legs, sit or lie with the toes held—this treats lumbar and back pain.\n\nExternally massage the abdomen down to the feet, grasp and pull with the hands, and hold the breath for twelve cycles—this treats leg numbness, dampness, and lumbar or back pain.\n\nPull the hair sharply with the left hand while pressing the nape with the right—this harmonizes yin and yang.\n\nSit upright, clasp both hands behind the back—this treats deficiency, emaciation, and disorders of the bowels and bladder.\n\nGrasp an overhead rope with one hand while holding the foot with the other—this treats hemorrhoids and swelling.\n\nCrouch low, clasp both knees with both hands, lower the head, and hold the breath for nine cycles—this treats neck pain, exhaustion, lumbar pain, and joint displacement.\n\nSit upright, tilt the head back, and exhale the qi of food, drink, or drunkenness—this instantly dissolves fullness.\n\nPracticed in summer, this naturally cools the body and prevents heat.\n\nPinch the nostrils with both thumbs and hold the breath—this prevents fatigue of yin and yang.\n\nRotate both feet outward ten times, then inward ten times—this supplements deficiency and replenishes qi.\n\nMaster Red Pine’s seated Dao-yin method, practiced regularly, sharpens hearing and vision, extends lifespan, and prevents the hundred diseases.\n\nFirst, kneel upright, extend both hands forward, spread them apart with fingers pointing outward.\n\nNext, kneel again, clasp the waist with both hands from the sides.\n\nThen, kneel once more, place the right hand on the waist and raise the left hand above the head.\n\nNext, kneel again, extend the right hand backward and clasp the waist with the left hand in front.\n\nThen, relax the posture, kneel, alternately stretch the hands forward and bend them back to clasp the waist.\n\nFinally, kneel upright and raise both hands high.\n\nHere ends the *Taiqing Dao-yin Nourishing Life Classic*.",

Partial content included in *The Seven Bamboo Tablets of the Cloudy Satchel*, Volume 34.\n2. Excerpts compiled in *Essential Extracts from the Daoist Canon* under *Ancient Immortal Methods of Guiding and Massage*, included in the third collection.\n\n---\n\n### **The Supreme Clarity Scripture on Guiding and Nurturing Life**\n**Cautious Practice of Internal Methods**\n\n**Chisongzi** was the Rain Master during the time of Shennong. He could ascend and descend with the wind and remained alive until the era of Gaoxin. His daily practice began at dawn: he would spread a mat facing east, first interlock his hands above his head, and pull his head to the ground, performing five *weng* breaths and five exhalations to dispel bloating and qi.\n\nNext, he would cover his head with his right hand while pressing his left elbow to the ground, stretching fully, then reverse the motion—covering with the left hand and pressing the right elbow to the ground—five times each, exhaling to cease, thus guiding the sinews and bones.\n\nThen, placing both hands on his right knee and lifting to the waist, he would raise his head after extreme stretching, pausing for five breaths to guide the waist.\n\nNext, his left hand would press his waist and left knee while his right hand stretched upward, then reversing—right hand on waist and right knee, left hand stretching upward—each for five breaths to guide the heart and abdomen.\n\nThen, his left hand would press his waist while his right hand stretched upward, reversing the motion with the right hand on the waist and left hand stretching upward, five breaths each, to guide the center of the abdomen.\n\nNext, interlocking his hands before his chest and ribs, he would shake his head left and right without ceasing until fully extended, thus guiding the face and ears to prevent perverse qi from entering.\n\nThen, placing both hands below his waist, he would sway left and right until fully extended, circulating the blood and vessels.\n\nNext, interlocking his hands, he would stretch fully, pulling left and right at the shoulders.\n\nThen, interlocking his hands and reversing them above his head, he would adjust left and right to guide the lungs and liver.\n\nNext, interlocking his hands before his chest, he would stretch fully left and right to expel vexing qi from the skin.\n\nThen, interlocking his hands left and right, he would lift his shoulders to guide the skin, standing and swaying to pull the two channels, dispelling leg qi.\n\nThe above is **Chisongzi’s Method of Guiding**, which eliminates the hundred diseases, prolongs life, and augments longevity. This should be practiced daily over time for benefit.\n\n**Master Ning** was a man of the Yellow Emperor’s time. As a pottery master, he could accumulate fire to burn himself and ascend or descend with the smoke, his clothes never scorched. His practice began between midnight and noon: facing east with unbound hair, he would clench his fists and hold his breath for one cycle, then raise his hands to guide left and right. Covering his ears with his hands prevented his hair from turning white. External guiding was performed three times, pressing the vessels beside his neck with his fingers three times to brighten his eyes.\n\nFacing east while seated, he would hold his breath for two cycles, then press his mouth with his middle fingers, spitting saliva fourteen times, rubbing and wiping his eyes to brighten them.\n\nFacing east while seated, he would hold his breath for three cycles, pinching his nostrils to cure chronic nasal polyps.\n\nFacing east while seated, he would hold his breath for four cycles, clicking his teeth without count, then prostrating forward and lying on his side, holding his breath for six cycles to cure deafness and dizziness.\n\nTurning outward, he would hold his breath for seven cycles to cure chest pain and coughing.\n\nHugging his knees and stretching upward from the ground, he would hold his breath for eight cycles to cure heat and perverse qi from the chest to the head, neck, ears, eyes, throat, and nose.\n\nRemoving his pillow, clenching his fists, and stretching upward from the ground while holding his breath for nine cycles, facing east to allow qi to circulate up and down, gently inhaling through the nose, cured emaciation.\n\nThose unable to follow yin-yang methods should not practice during major yin periods.\n\n**Toad Qi-Guiding Method:** Sit upright, swaying both arms without ceasing for twelve cycles to cure fatigue.\n\nLie on the left or right side, holding the breath for twelve cycles to dissolve phlegm and stagnant fluids. If the right side is afflicted, lie on the right; if the left, lie on the left. Expel undissolved qi.\n\nAt sunrise, noon, and sunset, face the sun and stand upright, holding the breath for nine cycles. Tilt the head back to absorb the sun’s essence, swallowing nine times to augment essence a hundredfold.\n\n**Fire-Entering Method (Arms Dangling Without Breathing to Avoid Fire Injury):**\nFacing south, squat with hands reaching through the bent knees to grasp the toes, curling them inward to benefit the waist and cure urinary blockage and incontinence.\n\nSitting with legs spread and feet crossed, hands placed inside the feet, then interlocking hands and stretching fully, cured nocturnal emissions and prevented leakage of essence and qi.\n\nInterlocking hands beneath the chin and stretching fully benefited lung qi and cured sudden coughing.\n\nLifting both feet to the sides of the cheeks, hands pressing the ground, cured chronic congestion.\n\nLifting the right hand and extending the left, sitting with the right foot covering the left, cured corpse-like pain.\n\nRaising hands to clasp the neck and stretching fully cured pain beneath the ribs.\n\nExtending the left hand while the right hand grasped the left thumb and stretched fully, then reversing—extending the right hand while the left grasped the right thumb and stretched fully—cured aching bones and joints.\n\nCovering both feet with hands, fingers pressing the toes, cured a broken waist unable to bend or lift, and long-standing blood stasis.\n\nStiffening the toes cured lumbar and spinal pain preventing backward glances.\n\nBringing the right hand from above the head downward while pulling the lower hand cured neck stiffness preventing backward glances.\n\nSitting on the ground, covering the left hand while the right hand pulled the shoulder, cured slanted knees, lumbar pain, and urinary blockage.\n\nFacing east while seated toward the sun, the left hand saluting the moon, lifting the body to gaze at the Northern Dipper, and absorbing the moon’s qi prevented the entry of all malign influences and cured head and neck stiffness.\n\nPulling the right hand backward and stretching fully, drawing the bow left and right, supplemented the five viscera’s insufficient qi. Finally, hugging both knees to the chest and stretching fully regularly returned the qi of the cinnabar field to supplement the brain.",

The cinnabar that gives life to humans is the returning that saves them; when complete, it extends years, when lost, it leads to decay. Therefore, Dao-yin expels all perverse qi from the limbs, bones, and joints, preserving the upright qi. Those who practice with sincerity and diligence, integrating it into their daily actions and speech, practicing day and night, will strengthen their bones and joints, curing the hundred diseases. If suddenly afflicted by wind stroke, chronic malaria, paralysis, deafness, head convulsions, coughing with counterflow qi, or lumbar pain, one may consult the illustrations, locate the ailment, circulate qi, and practice Dao-yin, using intention to expel and eliminate it. Circulating qi can supplement the internal, while Dao-yin can cure the four limbs. This is the natural Dao; only through diligent practice can one preserve harmony with heaven and earth.\n\n**Pengzu’s External Qi-Circulation Method:**\nPengzu was a minister of the Yin dynasty, living through the Xia and Shang, numbering seven hundred years. He regularly consumed cassia and attained the Dao. He often removed his clothing and coverings, stretched his waist, filled his lower abdomen, and held his breath for five cycles to guide the kidneys, curing wasting-thirst and benefiting yin and yang.\n\nHe also said: Extend the left leg, bend the right knee, and press inward for five cycles to guide the spleen, curing cold and heat in the heart and abdomen, and chest distension.\n\nPull the toes of both feet for five cycles to guide the abdomen, curing mounting and conglomerations, and benefiting the nine orifices.\n\nPoint both feet upward for five cycles to guide the lumbar spine, curing numbness and hemiplegia, and restoring hearing.\n\nTurn the soles of both feet inward to face each other for five cycles to guide the heart and lungs, curing coughing with counterflow qi.",

      "translated_text": "Bring the heels inward to face each other for five cycles to guide the thighs, dispelling qi from the five collaterals, benefiting the intestines and stomach, and expelling pathogenic qi.\n\nCover the left meridian, bend the right knee, and press inward for five cycles to guide the lungs, dispelling wind and deficiency, and brightening the eyes.\n\nStretch the meridians and pull the toes of both feet for five cycles to prevent cramps.\n\nPull both knees with the hands and place them on the chest for five cycles to cure lumbar pain.\n\nRotate both feet outward ten times, then inward ten times, ceasing to restore from all fatigue.\n\nThe external guiding method of Pengzu’s Valley Immortal dispels the hundred diseases and is essential for prolonging life and preserving health.\n\nIn all, ten movements and fifty breaths—five times fifty makes two hundred and fifty breaths.\n\nFor Daoist guiding, practice regularly from midnight to the crowing of the pheasant at dawn, avoiding full meals and bathing.\n\nThe Eight Spirit Daoist Guiding Method of Prince Qiao prolongs life, benefits longevity, and dispels the hundred diseases. The method states: The pillow should be four inches high, the feet five inches apart, and the hands three inches from the body. Remove clothing and unbound hair, lie flat on the back, and empty the mind of all thoughts. Calm the intent, then slowly inhale through the nose and exhale through the mouth, directing the breath to each organ in turn, repeating the cycle without end. To rest, first exhale fully and cease, without forcing prolonged breaths. With long practice, the breath will naturally lengthen. Let the coming and going of qi be so subtle that neither ear nor nose perceives it. Refine and concentrate it, then extend it gradually. The thighs and calves should remain still, with moderation prized. Whether faintly present or absent, perform this a hundred times. When the abdomen moves and qi resonates, and an external sound is heard in the feet, success is achieved. For those who attain success, what illness remains?\n\nThe throat resembles a silver ring, twelve layers thick, striking the chest to reach the lungs. Their color is white and lustrous, the front two lobes higher and the rear two lower. The heart strikes beneath them, broad above and tapering below, its crimson hue like a lotus bud yet to open, inverted and attached to the lungs. The liver connects below, its color a true green, like the head of a turtle dove. Its six lobes embrace the stomach, the front two higher and the rear four lower. The gallbladder connects beneath, resembling a green silk pouch. The spleen lies at the center, its golden-yellow hue gleaming like molten metal. The kidneys resemble two crouching rats, flanking the spine and aligned with the navel, desiring elevation. Their color is a true black, enveloped in fat and vessels, their white and black distinct. The stomach resembles a plain sack; envision its folds curving to the right, free from filth and decay.\n\nThe liver stores the hun-soul, the lungs store the po-soul, the heart stores the spirit, the spleen stores the intent, and the kidneys store essence—these are called the abodes of the spirits. When the abodes of the spirits are cultivated, the hundred vessels harmonize, and pathogenic diseases have no place to reside.\n\nThe small intestine is nine feet long, corresponding to the nine provinces. Another account says nine lands. The large intestine is twenty-four feet long.\n\nFor all Daoist guiding: those with deficiency should close their eyes, while those with excess should keep them open. Perform the guiding for the afflicted area without using the seventh breath. Move slowly back and forth for about two hundred steps, then sit and swallow qi five or six times. If the condition does not improve, repeat the method until cured.\n\nFor all ailments, lie flat on the back, unbound hair as prescribed, and slowly inhale through the mouth to fill the abdomen. Exert to the utmost until breath is nearly cut off, then slowly exhale through the nose. Repeat dozens of times. For deficiency, supplement; for excess, drain. Close the mouth, warm the qi, and swallow it thirty times. When the abdomen rumbles, cease. Walk back and forth for two hundred steps. If not cured, repeat the method.\n\nFor ailments in the throat or chest, raise the pillow seven inches. For ailments below the heart, raise the pillow four inches. For ailments below the navel, remove the pillow. Inhaling through the mouth and exhaling through the nose is called *supplementing*; closing the mouth, warming the qi, and swallowing it is called *draining*.\n\nMethod for treating all diseases by breath-holding:\nTo guide ailments of the head, tilt the head back.\nTo guide ailments of the waist and feet, point the toes upward.\nTo guide ailments of the chest, pull the toes.\nTo guide ailments of the arms, cover the arms.\nTo dispel cold, heat, or discomfort in the abdomen, or if afflicted by cold with fever, hold the breath and distend the abdomen. When needing to breathe, exhale slowly through the nose. Repeat until cured.\n\n1. Sit upright, straighten the waist, legs, and arms, place hands palms-down on the ground, and slowly inhale through the mouth and exhale through the nose to dispel pain in the chest and lungs. Warm the qi by swallowing, and close the eyes.\n\n2. Sit upright, straighten the waist, and tilt the head forward and backward thirty times each. Inhale through the nose, hold the breath, and eliminate head deficiency and depletion. Turn the head while keeping the eyes closed.\n\n3. Sit upright, straighten the waist, and lean to the left side. Inhale through the mouth and exhale through the nose to dispel accumulations and discomfort below the heart.\n\n4. Sit upright, straighten the waist, and slowly inhale through the nose. Hold the nose with the right hand to dispel dim vision, eye pain, nasal polyps, and deafness. It also dispels cold damage, head cold, and headache with chills. Sweating indicates success.\n\n5. Lie flat on the back, slowly inhale through the mouth and exhale through the nose to dispel abdominal tension. After eating, swallow qi dozens of times to warm it. Cold causes dry retching and abdominal pain. Inhale through the mouth seventy times to fill the abdomen greatly.\n\n6. Lie on the right side, inhale through the nose, and swallow qi dozens of times through the mouth. Rub the hands together until warm, then massage the abdomen to guide the qi downward and expel it, dispelling pain in the rib-side skin. Cease after seven breaths.\n\n7. Sit upright, straighten the waist, raise the body, extend both arms, and turn the palms upward. Inhale through the nose and hold the breath to the utmost for seven cycles, ceasing when pain arises in the center. This is called the Terrace of the King of Shu, dispelling accumulations below the rib-side.\n\n8. Lie face-down without a pillow, stand on both feet, inhale through the nose sixteen times, then exhale through the nose, ensuring the breath enters subtly.",

      "translated_text": "Here is the translation:\n\n---\n\nIts method: Clench the fists tightly, raise both hands and press them against the space between the breasts, lift the knees to brace the back and body. Internally close the breath, inflate the qi in the *qi* sea, allowing it to emerge naturally from within. Turn and revolve it, then exhale with a *he* sound. Stop after one or two sets of nine. This completes the purging of qi, after which it is regulated.\n\nPerform Dao-yin, ingest qi, sit facing east, hold the breath for four cycles, and tap the teeth fourteen times to cure tooth decay and pain. Some say it treats bleeding gums without decay.\n\n*Method for Swallowing Qi*:\nAll people receive the primordial qi of Heaven and Earth to sustain life. With each swallow and exhalation, the internal qi harmonizes with the external qi. From the *qi* sea, it rises with the breath to the throat. At the moment of full exhalation, seal the mouth, swallow with a rolling motion, and force it down with a gurgling sound. It then descends along the left side through twenty-four nodes, like water flowing through rapids, distinctly audible. For women, it descends along the right side. Thus, the internal qi is consolidated, clearly differentiated. Guide it with intention, massage it with the hands, and hasten its descent into the *qi* sea. The *qi* sea is located three inches below the navel, also called the lower *dantian*. For beginners in qi ingestion, if the upper burner is not yet unblocked, massage to assist its swift descent. Once the qi flows freely, it descends without massage. With the mouth closed, swallow twice in succession—this is called \"cloud travel.\" A moist swallow, mixing saliva with the qi, is called \"rain bestowal.\" When ingesting qi internally, if the qi has not yet circulated day and night, perform this with each swallow. Do not hastily progress to consecutive swallows. After three years of practice, success is achieved.\n\nPerform Dao-yin, ingest qi, stand upright against a wall, hold the breath, and circulate qi from the head to the feet to cure carbuncles, scabs, *da feng*, hemiplegia, and all convulsions. Some say circulate qi from the feet upward to the head.\n\nPerform Dao-yin and ingest qi: First lie supine, close the mouth, and inflate the cheeks and abdomen until the mouth is full of qi. Swallow, directing the intention to guide it backward. Practice this morning and evening—it is wondrous.\n\nPerform Dao-yin and ingest qi: Squat in a corner, clasp the knees with both hands, lower the head, and hold the breath for nine cycles to cure neck pain and lumbar or leg ailments. Some say it treats fatigue, with other effects the same.\n\nPerform Dao-yin and ingest qi: Extend both arms left and right, hold the breath for nine cycles to cure arm pain, fatigue wind, unregulated qi, and blockages.\n\nPerform Dao-yin and ingest qi: Sit upright, face the sky, and exhale the qi of wine, food, drunkenness, or fullness to dispel hunger and sober the mind. This is suitable for summer practice, preventing cold and restlessness.\n\nPerform Dao-yin and ingest qi: Sit upright, inhale through the nose, guide the qi down to the navel, and exhale slowly through the mouth without holding the breath to dissolve accumulations. This is suitable for those who prefer heat in summer.\n\nPerform Dao-yin and ingest qi: Lower the head slightly, hold a gentle breath, clasp the hands left and right, and hold the breath for twelve cycles to aid digestion, lighten the body, boost vitality, and prevent pathogenic qi from entering. Alternatively, perform Dao-yin, ingest qi, or circulate qi while lowering the head and squatting, binding oneself with a rope. Lower the head and hold the breath for ten cycles to aid digestion and lighten the body.\n\nPerform Dao-yin: Regularly press outward with both hands as if lifting a thousand *jin* stone, alternating left and right. Practicing this throughout life prevents illness.\n\nPerform Dao-yin: Place both hands on the ground, retract the body, arch the spine, and lift upward three times. Practicing this daily brings supplementation, benefit, and longevity. When performing this, avoid wind, hold the breath, and after each ingestion, exhale without letting the ears hear. If fatigued, use swallowing and exhalation. For cold in the viscera, blow out the qi; for heat, exhale it out.\n\nPerform Dao-yin and ingest qi: Imitate the movement of a snake, hold the breath, lie supine, then rise and squat. Face the direction of the prevailing phase (*wang xiang*), hold the breath, eat lightly to ensure smoothness. Ingesting qi is the foundation, saliva is the broth. In spring, release; in winter, store. The *Hua Chi* and *Yu Jiang* are sweet as dates. Strive to practice without doubt. Another version says: In spring, generate; in summer, nourish; in winter, gather and store internally. Close the eyes to inner light—other details are the same.\n\n*Method for Exhaling Qi*:\nFor those contemplating qi, *he* pertains to the heart, which governs the tongue. For dry mouth, rough qi, or all pathogenic qi, use *he* to cure it. For great heat, open the mouth wide; for slight heat, open it slightly. Adjust according to need, but excessive practice will cause harm.\n\nFor those contemplating qi, *hu* pertains to the spleen, which governs the central palace of Earth. For mild heat, abdominal distension, fullness, or stagnant qi, use *hu* to cure it.\n\nFor those contemplating qi, *xu* pertains to the liver, which governs the eyes. For red, swollen eyes, use *xu* to cure them.\n\nFor those contemplating qi, *chui* pertains to the kidneys, which govern the ears. For cold in the waist and knees or decline of the yang path, use *chui* to cure it.\n\nFor those contemplating qi, *si* pertains to the lungs, which govern the nose. For disharmony of cold and heat, use *si* to cure it.\n\n*He*, *si*, *hu*, *xu*, *chui*, and *xi*—each of the five viscera governs one qi. For extreme fatigue, follow these principles to achieve immediate relief.\n\nThe method of Dao-yin: The outer mat should be elevated to prevent earth qi from rising and ghostly qi from interfering.\n\nThe method of Dao-yin: Avoid impatience and haste, which are thieves to the body.\n\nThe method of Dao-yin: Do not face north, as it reverses the spirit. Violating this brings harm. For all matters, do not speak. On *hai* and *zi* days, do not spit facing north, as it diminishes lifespan.\n\nPerform Dao-yin and ingest qi: Contemplate the *Si Ming*, with two people alternating left and right turns, constantly visualizing its presence.\n\nPerform Dao-yin and ingest qi: Contemplate the divine radiance of yellow and the bright moon beside you, visible day and night.\n\nPerform Dao-yin and ingest qi: Contemplate the forms, qi, and colors of the five viscera circulating throughout the body.\n\nPerform Dao-yin and ingest qi: Contemplate the colored spirits of the five viscera in their respective places. From this point onward, the human form is entirely governed by the five phases.",
      "overlap_context": "nds to guide left and right, cover the ears with the hands, tap the neck arteries with the fingers five times. This brightens the eyes, blackens the hair, and prevents it from turning white, treating head wind.\n\n*Method for Purging Qi*:\nThe method states: Every person’s five viscera each have their own qi. When externally closing the breath and sensing afterward, those who wish to ingest qi should first purge and turn over the old food and stale qi to expel them, then regulate and ingest the qi.",
