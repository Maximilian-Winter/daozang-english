In the spring of the *bingwu* year, he discoursed on the *Changes of Fu Xi* in the northern suburbs of Tiaoyin. Three immortals from Mount Long came to pay homage at his sacred palace, bearing in their satchel a scroll—composed by Qiu Changchun of Pan Brook to propagate the profound truths of the Dao and enlighten deluded companions. Upon unsealing and perusing it, one finds its prose bold and unbridled, its ideas fresh and extraordinary, far beyond the grasp of mundane scholarship.\n\nOf old, Li Leran of Jade Palace and the Elder of Jade Peak both emerged from the gate of Zhanxiu Jue. Yet Li, with his innate wisdom, uttered words of mystery that startled all, unattainable by worldly talent. Having already prefaced and transmitted this work, how splendid! The wisdom of the Dao is not the wisdom of the world; the words of the Dao are not the words of the world.\n\nHow may this be verified? Mundane scholars, though they may puff their cheeks and grasp their brushes, do no more than sing of emotions and scour the world for scenes. Those who penetrate principle may illumine the boundary between Heaven and man, aiding the teachings of sages and worthies—even they may vie with the sun and moon in splendor. Yet those who awaken to truth are not thus confined: they utter wordless words, clarify the workings of creation, manifest the formless form, and cast off life and death. With effortless ease, untroubled by cogitation, they shake the void into thunder, and where no text is composed, constellations blaze forth.\n\nThe Elder of Jade Peak now bears witness among the immortals: unattainably high, he is high; unstriven for divinity, he is divine. Is this not because the one qi flows unimpeded, the six apertures stand wide, every gesture is wondrous, and every utterance rings true? Is this not the original state, rather than some borrowed passage? As *The Pan Brook Collection* says:\n*Hand grasping the numinous pearl, ever wielding the brush,*\n*Mind opened to Heaven’s music, no need to blow the flute.*\n\nAgain:\n*Crowned with pine blossoms, eating pine nuts,*\n*By the pine stream, drinking moonlit pine wind.*\n\nAgain:\n*Gathering the triple summer heat from every mountain peak,*\n*Transforming it all into a single ball of ice.*\n\nAgain:\n*Existence and non-existence are self-determined—*\n*What use then for craving and attachment?*\n\nAgain:\n*Wine poured like golden dew,*\n*Tea steeped with jade fungus fragrance.*\n\nAnd in verse:\n*All things laid down, all things are thus—*\n*Why choose between flower-lined streets and willow markets?*\n*The body of emptiness, originally one thing, without obstruction.*\n\nAgain:\n*Roaming the world without moving the body,*\n*Illumining the human realm, the mind rendered useless.*\n\nAgain:\n*Wearing out iron sandals in vain—*\n*Yet enlightenment dawns without leaving the hermitage gate.*\n\nThese few examples suffice; the reader will grasp the breadth.\n\nAlas! The bonds of immortality today must belong to those who in former lives contracted such affinity. Long ago at Eastern Hermitage, I formed a bond with Wang Fengxian the Perfected; in Chang’an, with Ma Danyang. Last autumn, a man from Junzhou came, and I formed a bond with Tan Xian. Only Master Qiu dwells far away on Mount Long. Yet all these—all of them Fengxian’s disciples—have now entered into affinity with me, not by human effort but by destiny.\n\nThough Master Qiu’s Dao was not revealed for my sake alone, its radiance is too vast to be concealed. Thus I, too, have come to share in this bond.\n\nWritten on a day in the fifth month of the bingwu year of the Dading era, by the Elder of Jade Peak, Hu Guangqian of Mount Zhongtiao.\n\nThe orchid grows deep in the forest, yet does not withhold its fragrance for lack of admirers. The crane cries in the distant marsh, and its call naturally reaches beyond. Men of lofty attainment and superior talent may dwell in seclusion, content with withered solitude in mountain fastnesses, or mingle unseen in bustling markets, lost in the dust. Though their abode be near, they seem distant; though their minds be still, their place feels remote. Drifting and floating, like a lone cloud in flight or an untethered boat, they appear and vanish between cinnabar skies and azure seas—where could they go and not be at ease?\n\nWith the Mysterious Origin as teacher and Supreme Harmony as companion, their distant hearts and untrodden paths abide in profound stillness and valley-like emptiness. They emulate the insightful ones who turn inward, follow the diligent practitioners of the highest order, cultivate truth and nurture life, and in leisure moments accumulate merit for others. They also give voice to their feelings in lofty verse and grand compositions, following the purple brush of the august sages to expound the empty songs of the Great Cavern. Their literary works and poetic lines have often appeared in the world.\n\nThus the orchid’s fragrance spreads, the crane’s call resounds. I have sketched this portrait: who, if not Master Qiu of Everlasting Spring, is such a one? A native of Qixia in Dengzhou, he studied alongside Masters Liu, Tan, and Ma under Wang Fengzi of Zhongnan. His name is renowned across the seas, revered near and far, and together with Qiu, Liu, Tan, and Ma, they are known as the Four Masters. Like the immortals and Daoist adepts of the ancient *Dispelling Delusion Treatise*, or the thirty-six methods of nurturing life to attain immortality as taught by the Most High—though dwelling in quiet obscurity among men—their disciples and followers, led by Qi, have come seeking a preface.\n\nThough I have long wished to behold their works, it was only at this riverside frontier that I was granted the honor of glimpsing their magnificent compilation.\n\nAppreciating their serene detachment and carefree ease, they roam unconstrained, even amid the vulgar and mundane. Like playful wanderers beyond the furrowed paths of brush and ink, their words remain uncarved and unpolished—neither cinnabar nor azure—just as the earthen drum and straw mallet seek no resonant performance, or the plain wine and simple broth offer no refined savor. Yet those who know music, who know beauty, shall find it here.\n\nTang’s Jiang Fang praised stillness, while Liao Chong of Fushan said: “The writings of immortals bear no literary art; their speech, no ornate phrases. Heart transmits to heart, unknown even to heaven and earth. They roam free in spirit—who in past or present could claim to rival them?” Master Qiu of Everlasting Spring echoed this.\n\nOn the winter solstice of the *dingwei* year of the Dading era, Mao Hui, Gentleman for Literary Composition, former Erudite of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices and Collator of Texts, Cloud-Banner Cavalier in retirement from Pingyang, composed this preface.\n\nThe subtleties of the Supreme Dao cannot be sought through sound or color, nor glimpsed through form or trace. They must rely on perfected beings to devise means of transmission—composing verses and selecting lines—so that others may recite and chant them, gradually entering the sacred realm and approaching the Mystery’s gate. Yet if phrases lack incisiveness and prose lacks depth, how can they captivate their age or inspire later learners?\n\nNow, beholding Master Qiu of Everlasting Spring’s *Collected Works of Pan Creek*, I find that even a single word or phrase suffices to rouse the deaf and blind, to cleanse the dust of clamor. Was he not born with keen insight, dedicating himself to the Dao before reaching twenty? For over forty years, he has remained sleepless, recording three thousand words daily, traversing ten thousand *li* of land, storing the Three Teachings and nine schools within his breast, their radiance illuminating his spirit. Small wonder his fame resounds at the vermilion palace, where imperial edicts beckon, and his affinity with true immortals delights in the golden carp’s attainment.\n\nThus, among the thousands who followed Chongyang’s path, only Qiu, Liu, Tan, and Ma stood out as exceptional. Yet even among them, his lofty renown alone draws universal acclaim.\n\nRecently, an old friend, Gong Hengdao of Longxi, journeyed from Donglai straight to the prefectural office of Fengcheng, earnestly entreating a preface for the collection. He bowed repeatedly, pressing his request again and again. Though I know my hands, calloused by sword and ledger, are ill-suited to capture even a faint likeness, I have long admired his reputation and regretted never having met him. Now, with the arrival of this season’s guest, the measuring line cannot be drawn back. With no way to decline, I reluctantly inscribe these few words.\n\nOn the second day after the Double Fifth Festival of the *bingyin* year of the Taihe era, Yila Lin, Grand General of Zhaoyi, Military Commissioner of Wuding Army, concurrently Surveillance Commissioner of Fengsheng Prefecture, Director of Ever-Normal Granaries, Defender-in-Chief, Marquis of Qishui Commandery with a fief of one thousand households and an actual enfeoffment of one hundred households, inscribed this.\n\nFormerly, Master Zhuang composed thirty-three chapters, most of which employed parables and analogies. Later discussants of the Dao followed suit, taking the rejection of cleverness, the abandonment of excess, and the nurturing of spirit and qi as their foundation.\n\nRegarding the guidance of common folk and the transformation of the obstinate—dispelling their delusions—even the most reticent cannot avoid resorting to speech. The eminent scholar of the Eastern Lands, Master Qiu the Perennial Spring, was born in Qixia of Dengzhou. A year before coming of age, he wandered to Mount Kunyu, where he encountered Wang Haifeng, the Master of Double Yang. With a single word, their Dao resonated, and he became his disciple. Wang bestowed upon him a poem, which read:\n\n*\"Gently I reel in the silk line,\nDrawing you into Penglai, forever free.\"*\n\nFrom this, one may discern how deeply he had penetrated the caverns of principle. After some time, he accompanied his fellow aspirants—Masters Ma, Tan, and Liu—in following the Master of Double Yang to Nanjing. Those who knew them called Qiu, Liu, Tan, and Ma the Four Friends of the Forest’s Edge. Before long, the Master of Double Yang relinquished his abode. The four escorted his coffin back to Zhongnan for burial, dwelling in a hut beside his grave. When the mourning period ended, each discussed where to go next. Only Master Qiu delighted in the customs of Qin and Long, residing six years at the Temple of Pan Stream and seven years on Mount Longmen. He begged for food and drink to sustain his days, and his reputation spread far and wide.\n\nIn the *wushen* year of the Dading era, Emperor Shizong, having heard of him, summoned him by imperial courier to the capital. There, he was granted a cap, sash, and robe, and received in the side hall. On four occasions, he presented verses long and short to expound the meaning of cultivating the True. The Emperor praised and marveled at them.\n\nFollowing his return to the mountains, he engaged with the world and responded to custom, answering questions as circumstances allowed. His poems, hymns, and lyrics numbered no less than several hundred. Their words were forthright and their principles penetrating—truly one who, free from desire, beheld the wondrous, and through deep cultivation attained self-realization.\n\nHis disciples compiled his works into a vast collection, intending to carve them into woodblocks to spread their transmission, and sought a preface to place at the head of the volume. I would say: the ancient recluses fell into three broad types. Some roamed freely in the wilds, their names drawing others to follow, while the sovereign’s esteem led him to seek them out; some upheld unyielding conduct, unbending to worldly custom, and though they might respond to summons, they could never be fettered by worldly affairs, leaving all to long for their bearing; others, content with meager means and delighting in mountains and forests, fled into emptiness and never returned, so that the world forever exalted their virtue and could not speak ill of them. Master Changchun embodied all three, and thus it was fitting that he received the Emperor’s questions in rustic garb, inspiring admiration and longing from all quarters. He was no profit-seeking pretender who feigned reclusion to make a name, deceiving the foolish and hoodwinking the blind for personal gain.\n\nThe Master now resides at the Pavilion of Supreme Emptiness in Mount Qixia, and the day we might meet face-to-face and sit knee-to-knee has not yet come. This account of his life’s outline is offered so that, should we chance to meet in the future, he will not regard me as a stranger.\n\nWritten on the full moon of the intercalary fourth month in the *wuchen* year of the Taihe era, by Chen Daren of Andong, Hanlin Academician, Grand Master for Thorough Counsel, Drafter of Imperial Edicts, Concurrently Supervisor of the Directorate of Education, Light Chariot General, Baron of Yingchuan County with a fief of seven hundred households, and recipient of the Purple Gold Fish Bag.\n\n*Panxi Collection, Volume One*\n*Composed by Qiu Chuji, the Master of Everlasting Spring of Mount Qixia*\n\n**Seven-Language Regulated Verse**\n\n**Qin Chuan**\nQin Chuan, since ancient times the imperial domain,\nMisty hues and auspicious qi arise and reign.\nEvery hill and stream in splendor stands,\nAll who dwell here vie in grace and grand.\nTen years of ardent resolve, high repose forgot,\nWillingly I roam ten thousand li for the Way’s plot.\nLike a lone cloud I drift to this land,\nIn misty grottoes refining the true and grand.\n\n**Panxi**\nSince parting from old friends, fate has spun its thread,\nWandering west, I dwell by the Hao River’s bed.\nThrough wind and dust, ten thousand li I’ve come,\nThree years in cliffs and vales I’ve made my home.\nContent with poverty, as now I know,\nWho can match the ancients, their Dao to bestow?\nFortunate to find this pure and stainless ground,\nI cultivate the true and sleep till sun is high unbound.\n\n**Carving the Everlasting Spring Grotto at Panxi**\nTowering peaks touch the clouded way,\nTen thousand ancient cypresses sway.\nSacred herbs hide from the vulgar eye,\nDivine birds answer only the Daoist’s cry.\nThe grotto carved, immortals descend,\nElixir refined, all demons end.\nWhere else are blessed lands and famed peaks found?\nEverlasting Spring—this small Penglai’s ground.\n\n**Secluded Dwelling**\nBy the terrace, streams and valleys pure and bright,\nBeyond the wilds, a mountain home, still and quiet.\nAt the frontier, clouds disperse, the sky gleams clear,\nIn the empty woods, night deepens, the moon sheds its cheer.\nEyes alight, gaze wide, the heart unfurls,\nHair unbound, robes loose, far from the world’s whirls.\nI know how to steal life in these rocky lairs,\nBut who can unfold the Dharma-wheel’s affairs?\n\n**Spring Dawn After Rain**\nRain clears, spring’s hues shine twice as bright,\nWind draws the sound of springs from emerald height.\nRoosting crows chatter at dawn’s cunning art,\nTravelers wander, lost to the night’s part.\nGreen trees rise uneven, fresh with grace,\nYoung shoots swell, vast in their place.\nAt the grotto’s mouth, the cranes of Penglai call,\nFrom the sky’s edge, a lone raincoat answers the thrall.\n\n**Resolute Will**\nMy heart for the Dao stands firm and true,\nFrom youth I’ve worn the alchemical script’s hue.\nNineteen years in cliffs and vales I’ve hid,\nThree thousand li as a tumbleweed I’ve slid.\nNo dreams of home bind my heart’s release,\nWith resolve, I’ll be an immortal beyond the world’s fleece.\nThough blessings be light and demons’ snares tight,\nPersevere—merit will make all right.\n\n**Self-Portrait**\nI wander clouds and waters, lone and free,\nNo love for the red dust’s fiery spree.\nTen thousand leagues of rivers and lakes my old trade,\nA straw cloak and misty rain my life’s parade.\nDrunk, I lie on rocks, robes open wide,\nAwake, I stroll the woods, arms swinging with pride.\nWhen night deepens and clouds part their veil,\nIn the moon’s glow, I play the flute’s tale.\n\n**In Reply to Scholar Meng of Ganzhen, Beizhen Garrison (Nanchang)**\nTen years since I left my native ground,\nA drifting cloud on rivers, I in Qin Chuan found.\nLoose robes, patched when autumn winds arise,\nFull, I sleep through nights in quiet guise.\nIn Shaanxi’s west, I shun the floating world’s din,\nAt heaven’s edge, I met the Great Luo’s kin.\nYet merit falls short of immortality’s vow,\nI wait for glad tidings at Kuangyu’s brow.\n\n**In Reply to Scholar Li Si, Inviting Me to Stay North of the Wei**\nYou wrote of poetry, years ago you pledged to cross,\nBut this year I must wander—my nature resists the Way’s gloss.\nMy body and heart follow sun and moon’s flow,\nWith cliffs and vales, I pass spring and autumn’s glow.\nDeep in Guo’s town, many talents reside,\nFar they seek Panxi’s reclusive tide.\nNot that I refuse your northern abode,\nHere too the true cultivation may be bestowed.\n\n**Declining an Invitation from Daoist Friends to Visit the Temple of the Grand Duke at Panxi**\nNo wild whims urge me to roam,\nSeeing through all, I let the world go.\nWho seeks Panxi to ease their gloom?\nIn cliffs and vales, I linger slow.\nOnce three thousand li from the eastern sea,\nThrough twenty provinces my journey’s spree.\nAll famous mountains and scenes I’ve seen,\nYet nothing outside this body holds me.\n\n**Seeking a Galloping Horse at the Panxi Temple**\nI hear at Panxi the Grand Duke hides,\nWhere cliffs are high and trees dense, the shrine abides.\nOn flowered mornings, stone caves roar with dragon’s mist,\nMoonlit nights, the temple gates howl with the wind’s twist.\nFor ten thousand years, the bear’s resolve stands tall,\nThree springs, galloping steeds offer all.\nWith poetry, I seek a thousand steeds or more,\nInk-stained brushwork—my daily chore.\n\n**In Reply to Magistrate’s Son, Scholar Xu**\nTowering green junipers gird the sky’s rim,\nSheer cliffs cradle a hermit’s home within.\nThe jade grotto knows no lamp nor flame,\nGreen mountains all day wreathe in mist and frame.\nAn empty heart, a full belly—just rice I seek,\nGuests welcomed, but no tea I brew to speak.\nContent with quiet, I find my small delight,\nWhy boast of my door’s humble sight?\n\n**In Reply to the Qinghe Clan**\nThough born of mortal flesh, your spirit shines,\nYour qi upright—fit for the Dao’s designs.\nYet fear the cinnabar sinks below your navel’s gate,\nAnd white snow returns to chill your ear’s estate.\nHow to escape the red dust’s snare?\nLike me, ascend the jade peaks’ stair.\nStep by step, the Milky Way’s path I tread,\nWild clouds part as I rise, light as lead.\n\n**To Secretary Qu of Jingzhou and Provincial Graduate Liu**\nIf Daoist friends seek me out,\nNo need for gifts or formal bout.\nWorldly splendor cannot buy the Way,\nWorldly ties but weary the heart each day.\nUnlearned, indolent, my words are few,\nIn seclusion, years pass in quiet hue.\nBeyond all cares, I cast them aside,\nFrom the clouds, I listen to your lofty pride.\n\n**To Wang and Zhou, Who Visited Me**\nWhy bring a meal, you two?\nBeyond the walls, we roam the wilds anew.\nWinding through villages, you seek the Way,\nLingering in its joy, you steal the day.\nI know your old free spirit’s flight,\nFar you gaze at Xinglü’s height.\nAll day we laugh and talk at ease,\nBeneath the moon, we homeward please.\n\n**To Fellow Daoists Inquiring About Cultivation**\nMy steps drift where they may,\nWhat of cultivation can I say?\nMy Daoist eye lacks light, I shun the town,\nHeaven’s heart eludes me—I drift with the flow’s crown.\nHungry, I beg from door to door,\nFull, I sing with belly’s roar.\nBeyond this foolish self’s display,\nAll else I know not, come what may.\n\n**To Daoist Friends Seeking Worn Cloth and Old Sandals**\nSix years in the western wastes I’ve stayed,\nNo new robes nor shoes have I arrayed.\nEach mid-autumn, I patch my coarse cloak’s thread,\nBy autumn’s wind and rain, my sandals lie dead.\nA body is easily clad in cold and hunger’s sting,\nBut without fortune, time stretches long, no joy to bring.\n\n**May all of you hold compassion in your hearts,**\n**And lend support to walk together toward the immortal realm.**\n\n**Matching Rhymes for Scholar Zhang Yin of Yin County**\nMist and rosy clouds fill the valley thick,\nIn profound stillness, the heart mirrors emptiness’ trick.\nLong songs sung where spring waters flow,\nAlone I sit, watching clouds in dawn winds blow.\nTo shun harm, truly rely on the Dao’s might,\nYet bestowing kindness fails to grasp the divine’s light.\nYou delve deep into scriptures’ abstruse core—\nWhy seek the eastern glow when reflection’s at the fore?\n\n**Borrowing Books from Scholar Zhang Wu of Yin County**\nA noble house, its literary fame long known,\nOrchids and jade trees fill the courtyard’s throne.\nGeneration upon generation, heroes arise,\nGathering often to discourse ‘neath virtue’s skies.\nMy humble talent embraced the Dao late,\nYet you, with vast learning, pierce the heart’s gate.\nNo need for idle jest or endless perusal—\nLend me more books to wander the ethereal.\n\n**Mid-Autumn Moon Unseen**\nFor years the bright moon fails to shine clear,\nIn vain we set jade mats, yearning year after year.\nOft resentful when rain would intervene,\nWho knew tonight clouds would veil its sheen?\nIs the Moon Goddess lost in floral slumber?\nDoes the Jade Hare still pound elixirs in haste and number?\nWorldly joys bring no true gain—\nIn the void beyond, conceal your light’s domain.\n\n**Beholding the Moon**\nDense clouds retreat, the evening breeze grows still,\nThe radiant moon’s glow stirs the Nine Lands’ will.\nTen thousand leagues of azure sky bathe in its light,\nYellow leaves of autumn chill the four quarters’ flight.\nFrom high above, the toad’s form seems to appear,\nAcross the wilds, specters are bound in fear.\nUnfettered, round, and pure—solitary, bright,\nIt drifts beyond the dust, free from earthly blight.\n\n**On the Moon Osmanthus at the Wang Residence (Borrowing Its Meaning)**\nWithin Taiyuan’s gates, the scene runs deep,\nA cluster of immortal blooms outshines all time’s sweep.\nRoots and trunk rise above the clouds’ domain,\nAncestors trace their lineage to the moon’s bright plain.\nFragrant buds, crimson-dusted, blaze,\nLush leaves, layered, lock in emerald haze.\nEach blossom’s spirit transcends the mundane—\nSoaring, they command the world’s acclaim.\n\n**Planting Moon Osmanthus**\nThe craftsman’s hand seals the moon osmanthus’ planting,\nThe recluse tends the sacred flower’s dais, enchanting.\nIts wondrous roots defy the common kind,\nIts harmonious qi marks it as the Dao’s refined.\nSun and moon converge in timeless grace,\nHeaven and earth alone command its place.\nNoble scholars, cherish this eternal spring—\nDo not mistake it for mere blossoms’ offering.\n\n**Three Poems on Mountain Dwelling**\n**I**\nDragon Gate’s waters flow, clear and bright,\nSouthward they surge ‘gainst Crimson Cliff’s height.\nTen thousand ravines’ springs converge in a rush,\nA thousand crags’ stone walls echo with a hush.\nThey cleave the red dust’s realm in their winding flight,\nUnfurling white jade’s essence in the light.\nEndless wonders—words cannot contain—\nI stand in the wind, brush in hand, to ordain.\n\n**II**\nNo grudge for gathering firewood in the deep mountain,\nFor here, a pure elegance holds its own domain.\nA stone chamber’s retreat nears the immortals’ land,\nNo need for walls—worldly affairs lie far and grand.\nFeasting, I call to cranes beyond the sky,\nGazing up, I watch eagles in the gorge fly.\nEver the shifting scenes of black and white unfold—\nTrue emptiness shines, dispelling solitude’s cold.\n\n**III**\nAlone in the mountains, solitude grows,\nIdle clouds my companions, shielding from the world’s throes.\nIndolent, I forget life’s clumsy art,\nLoving stillness, I melt into the familiar part.\nWhy feign greatness to rival Li and Du?\nWhy strive to match the immortals’ view?\nProbing life’s span and literary might—\nCan they surpass the void’s creative height?\n\n**Plantains on Longshan’s Slopes**\nA single green leaf unfurls like a palm’s embrace,\nThree cascades of white waves scatter petals in space.\nBelow the mountain, Yu’s temple overlooks the triple pool.\nBy day, guests come often to admire its rule,\nBeneath the moon, none keep it company—alone it stays.\nCreation’s vastness defies all compare—\nAmong grasses and trees, only the plantain holds sway.\nLet not the common winds and rains its grandeur impair.\n\nLet it stand daily as your golden table’s grace,\nWith guests, toast often from jade cups’ embrace.\nWhen Master Mao studied the Dao in Qi,\nNo messenger was sent—yet golden tables and jade cups appeared nigh.\n\n**In Praise of Dan Yang’s Longzhen’s Daoist Awakening**\nScholar Ma Tan reached the sacred court,\nDoubt’s ancient tangle transcended in a single sport.\nIn clouds, he gathered herbs to simmer in the golden pot,\nAfter fire’s trial, the elixir stored in jade ladle’s lot.\nA luminous pearl in hand, he wields his brush with might,\nHis heart opened to celestial strains—no need for flute’s light.\nSoon he’ll mount the crane, ride the wind away,\nBetween sea and mortal realm, his shadow fades astray.\n\n**The Crane**\nA spirit-bird of lofty nature and grace,\nCinnabar crowns its head, snow drapes its face.\nThrough vast seas it roams the Three Isles’ span,\nAcross long winds, its cry rings o’er the marshland.\nIts spirit soars, untouched by worldly ties,\nIts soaring ambition joins the immortal skies.\nBeating the wind, it trims its wings on high—\nTen thousand miles it traverses, effortless in the sky.\n\n**To Jia Gu Qingshen, Prefect of the Western Capital in Lingbei**\nFrom the Eastern Sea, my wild gaze still strains,\nThe Western Capital’s prefect yet untouched remains.\nLast year, I obeyed the edict to winter’s call,\nThis summer, your letter arrived in autumn’s thrall.\nWhen will the northern post’s honors cease?\nWhen shall I return to southern mountains’ peace?\nBest make plans for Pengcheng soon—\nThe Yan family’s customs stand firm, immune to ruin.\n\n**The Hall of Master Gong in the Western Mountains of Yizhou**\nHigh above the clouds, Master Gong’s hall gleams,\nFlickering rosy clouds bathe the cave in beams.\nPeaks of a thousand fathoms flank its side,\nTen thousand pines and cypresses in waves abide.\nThe mountain elder speaks not of past or present’s lore,\nWandering guests arrive to discourse on the primordial’s core.\nSay not a lifetime spent in seated stillness is vain—\nIt surpasses the world’s ceaseless, frantic train.\n\n**Response to the Yellow Register Ritual at Fushan County (With Preface)**\nIn the autumn of *Mingchang Jia Yin*, the ninth month, a Yellow Register Ritual was held in Fushan County. On the twenty-eighth day, just before transmitting talismans and precepts, eleven cranes soared above the altar, lingering through the night. The next day, as the ritual commenced, the Celestial Gate shook with thunderous sound, and from the North Star descended a red glow, illuminating the earth so clearly that even the finest details were discerned—seen by all, officials and common folk alike.\n\nLamps of splendor gild a mountain of gold,\nAs if Penglai’s isle lies but a hand’s span from home.\nThe unenlightened turn their hearts to open earth’s gate,\nWhile high immortals’ power stirs heaven’s domain.\nA thousand doors array their offerings in solemn flame,\nTen thousand voices unite in joyful acclaim.\nThe merit complete across the Three Realms and Ten Directions,\nColorful clouds and immortal cranes return whence they came.\n\n**After the Winter Solstice of Cheng’an Ding Si, Bitter Cold**\nAt times, affairs in the northern frontier unfold.\n\nBefore winter’s onset and after its close, snow stretches endlessly,\nPure yang qi sinks low, all things wither and dry.\nBeyond the pass, horses startle at treacherous mountain paths,\nBorder guards endure hardship in iron-clad cold.\nThough the northern frontier suffers bitter trials,\nFortune smiles on Shandong’s scholars and common folk.\nDaily, the state expends three hundred thousand in resources—\nHow could lives not wither and fade?\n\n**Four Poems on Flat-Top Hall**\n*(At the Celestial Void Abbey of Misty Peaks)*\n\nYear after year, during the triple-heat days, I ascend Flat-Top Mountain,\nWhere travelers seldom come and go.\nEyes gaze upon the pale azure skies, clouds drifting faint,\nBody suspended in the azure void, nature at ease.\nSolitary and lofty, it soars beyond peaks and ridges,\nIts vast prospect unlike that between sea and Mount Tai.\nUnder the white sun, red-dust chariots and horses rush—\nWho could come here to lean upon the railing?\n\nThe mountain hall stands high and pure, leaning against the cool heavens,\nBeyond the sky, a clear breeze lingers in the seat.\nThe azure bird sometimes deigns to glance this way,\nWhite clouds drift all day of their own accord.\nWhere lie the golden altars and jade terraces?\nThe crimson gates and jasper towers remain undocumented in ancient times.\nHow could they compare to this mountain retreat, where one rests and withdraws,\nBody and heart unmoved, arriving at the immortal realm?\n\nBy day, the mountain hall is quiet, few visitors come,\nSurrounding seats stand tall amidst emerald peaks.\nThe azure sky is flawless as the red sun turns,\nGreen mountains unmoving while white clouds fly.\nAll things, uneven yet distinct, reveal divine transformation,\nThe three spirits, distant yet bound, unite in harmony.\nFrom beginning to end, it stems from the Dao of purity—\nIf one can embody it, heaven and earth all return to the self.\n\nThree poles of red sun linger, yet sleep remains,\nTen miles of green mountains sit in tranquil repose.\nUnaware of visitors beyond the secluded garden,\nOnly startled by a dog’s bark amid the white clouds.\nWith no intent, one naturally attains eternal wandering,\nWhat need to ask of the great return?\nOnly fear that soon the celestial music will fade,\nAnd no way to linger in joy upon Flat-Top Mountain.\n*(Written in jest.)*\n\n**Gazing at the Tides by the Sea**\nWhen the great wind rises, the northern sea grows cold,\nA thousand miles of towering waves roll like snow-capped mountains.\nTheir wrathful hue surges to the heavens, darkening the sky,\nThunderous roars erupt from the earth, startling the dusty world.\nThe river god churns waves in hidden submission,\nThe Yellow River’s spirit, shamed, overflows in sweat.\nWhite horses and plain carriages hold but empty might—\nWithout immortality, no path leads to ascent.\n\n**Inscribed at the Various Pan Abbeys**\nTen *li* southwest of the prefecture, I ascend,\nWhere springs and stones open wide to form a secluded dwelling.\nMountains deep and seas vast reflect each other,\nThe land remote, clouds idle, free to unfurl and gather.\nFlanking paths, clear pools gleam with radiance,\nTowering willows by the sky cradle the toad of the moon.\nPlaying the zither, seated before mist and rosy clouds,\nI laugh and point to the toil of life—a fleeting dream.\n\n**Mid-Autumn Day, Roaming the Various Pan Abbeys with Daoist Friends**\n*(At a time when some were preparing for the autumn examinations.)*\n\nThe crisp air clears as summer’s heat wanes,\nGardens and groves shift into brocade patterns.\nA long wind crosses the sea from the desert,\nShort shadows traverse the sky past Jade Pass.\nWe set out mats to welcome guests by the Dragon Tree,\nPlay the zither awaiting the moon by Tiger Creek.\nTrue companions naturally find the finest joys—\nNo need to pluck osmanthus in the Moon Palace.\n\n**Autumn Dawn, Roaming West Creek with Penglai Daoist Friends**\nFacing waters, ascending mountains, we ride the dawn wind,\nWith empty hearts and steady gaze, we witness the autumn sky.\nClouds veil the sea peaks in deepening emerald,\nThe sun strikes the celestial wheel in dazzling crimson.\nOur wandering spirit does not turn with other things,\nWe harmonize with the world’s dust for a time.\nThree years, four times we’ve shared this joyous gathering—\nAgain, we arrive east of the swelling sea, west of the mountains.\n\n**Written En Route**\nIn the tenth month of the second year of Mingchang, I arrived at Misty Peaks.\nIn the fifth month of the third year, Penglai Daoist friends invited me to spend summer,\nAnd thereafter, year after year, it became our custom—\nEach fifth month, they would send for me.\n\nYear after year in the fifth month, I come to Penglai,\nWhere wheat ripens like gold and silver, flowers bloom in succession.\nWandering guests sate hunger with purple mulberries,\nTravelers quench thirst awaiting yellow plums.\nClouds billow atop the peaks, linking the towering mountains,\nWaves surge at my feet, crashing from the sea.\nIn the vermilion summer, our excursions are grand and splendid,\nOur feelings vast as the celestial net.\n\n**Two Poems Seeing Off Scholar Chen and Attendant Perfect Man Wan-Yan to the Examinations**\nWithin the six directions, the myriad things are born,\nYet humans stand highest among them in clarity.\nOne who can fathom the yin-yang numbers beyond things,\nAnd seize the world’s wealth and fame—\nOf old, cinnabar required nine refinements,\nBut now the celestial path takes but three stages.\n*(Referring to the three examinations of today.)*\nWith the talent of a banished immortal, nothing lingers,\nSoon you will soar to the Great Clarity.\n\nA man of lofty integrity, his qi soars above the clouds,\nFor a decade, he has quietly studied the myriad truths.\nThough his belly is full of poetry and books, aligned with the Dao,\nHis outstanding talent has yet to astonish the world.\nThe strategies of the charging ox are unmatched,\nThe prose of the rearing steed is divinely inspired.\nOne day, when his work is complete and his heart awakens,\nHe will startle awake from the millet dream, his body still within.\n\n**Frost on the Third Day After Clear Brightness, Taihe Xinyou Year**\nJust after rain, we beheld the fairest of spring scenes,\nWhen suddenly, before the wind, ten thousand flowers withered.\nIn a single night, gardens and groves lost their color,\nThe season of triple spring grows too desolate.\nJust as the Eastern Lord displays his artistry,\nHow can one bear the Green Maiden’s proud might?\nThe suffering of living beings is hard to escape—\nThe root of creation remains untranscended.\n\n**Falling Flowers**\nYesterday, flowers bloomed in crimson across the trees,\nToday, flowers fall, leaving ten thousand branches bare.\nTheir flourishing relied on the splendor of triple spring,\nTheir transformation swiftly follows a night’s wind.\nBeyond things, time flows naturally as it will,\nWho among mortals can fathom birth and decay?\nThe great and small matters of glory and withering in a hundred years—\nThey pass before the eyes like a single dream.\n\n**Setting Out for Penglai: Ascending the Mountain at Dawn for the Di Family Ritual**\nCocks crow, stirring the spirit,\nBreath held, I ascend the mountain, body surging upward.\nThe path is treacherous, barely discernible,\nThe forest deep, travelers indistinguishable.\nParting the clouds, I gaze down upon the Eastern Sea,\nThe summit’s solitary height reflects the North Star.\nThose who diligently practice goodness in daily life—\nWith empty hearts and steadfast resolve, they remain in the world.\n\n**Proceeding to the North Sea Ritual in Weizhou**\n*(Invited by Commander Wen-Di-Han.)*\n\nThe yin wind from the North Star sweeps across the sea,\nThe wind and scenery of sea and mountains turn desolate.\nMountain shadows accumulate snow, cold blankets the earth,\nLayered ice on the sea freezes to the heavens.\nSwans and geese flee a thousand *li* from the frontier,\nDragons slumber deep in ninefold abysses.\nWhy does this Daoist persist in folly?\nBraving frost and ice to attend the ritual feast.\n\n**Yellow Register Ritual in Changyang**\nIn the tenth month, Changyang’s five grains abound,\nWe recall the Yellow Register, erecting a pure standard.\nLuminous lamps and feathered robes array the three halls,\nCrimson banners and rainbow streamers descend from the nine skies.\n\n**Ritual Ascends the Altar, a Thousand Gather**\nIncense clouds weave a canopy as myriad spirits pay homage.\nFrom this moment, blessings descend and misfortunes disperse,\nA whole county stealthily shifts—hundreds of calamities vanish.\n\n**Passing Mount Gongxian**\nGongxian’s jagged rocks forbid the horse’s tread,\nValley winds sigh, tigers elude the seeker’s gaze.\nMountains bristle like swords and halberds, vast and uneven,\nQi thickens in mist and haze, deep and obscure.\nThe Daoist throng does not idle to admire the scenery—\nEvery horizon is but a fine grove of trees.\nThus we proceed from the North Sea’s Yellow Register rites,\nWending eastward to Lai to pay homage at Emerald Peak.\n\n**Avoiding Affairs, Passing Mount Gongxian**\nLeisurely staff in hand, I tread the immortal’s trail,\nCrossing stones and threading woods toward Master Gai.\nThe Western Sea’s clouds churn darkly,\nThe Eastern Mountains’ dawn sun veils the wild geese.\nTen thousand ravines twist in deep, hidden paths,\nThree prefectures drift like tumbleweeds in the gloom.\nIn action or retreat, the heart remains unstained—\nLet the staff strike empty space at will.\n\n**Sudden Rain**\nMyriad layers of dense clouds mass,\nA thousand fathoms of white rain plunge from the mountain gate.\nYin and yang clash, wind and thunder rage,\nGrasses and trees wail as the cosmos darkens.\nBirds and beasts lose their way in the gloom,\nFish and dragons entwine in turbid waters.\nIn this instant, creation startles heaven and earth—\nWho perceives the root within a hand’s span?\n\n**Two Poems on the Great Snow of the Eighth Day of Late Winter**\n\n**I**\nLast night the south wind shifted to the north,\nBy dawn, heaven and earth were veiled in wild geese’s flight.\nScattered pearls and shattered jade follow high and low,\nTen thousand ravines and a thousand peaks merge in sameness.\nSun and moon know not where to settle,\nMountains and rivers are sealed in boundless obscurity.\nOnly in returning to observe the principles of yin and yang and life’s nature\nDo I recognize the workings of emptiness and creation.\n\n**II**\nLast night the south wind shifted to the north,\nBy dawn, heaven and earth were veiled in wild geese’s flight.\nMountain hamlets and rustic inns differ house by house,\nWillow fluff and plum blossoms are alike everywhere.\nClouds withdraw from pine halls and stone chambers,\nJade terraces and crystal pavilions gleam in the moonlight.\nWhy inquire further of the omen of a bountiful year?\nThis profound beauty is the very work of the Great Dao.\n\n**Two Poems in Response to Prefect Zhang of Dinghai Commandery’s Visit in the Snow**\n\n**I**\nThe ritual hall lies deep, its curtains undrawn,\nIn pure fasting, I sit in stillness, oblivious to schemes.\nHeavenly flowers drift down in profusion,\nThe sea’s moon glows faintly over the vast mountains.\nThe pale sun drifts through the golden hall at dawn,\nThe piercing wind scatters jade-like dust in flight.\nThis auspicious snow of midwinter is true joy—\nYet through the ages, who discerns right from wrong?\n\n**II**\nAuspicious snow flutters, my rustic mood runs deep,\nI open the gate, staff in hand, lingering at ease.\nGreedily watching the six-petaled jade flowers fall,\nI fail to notice the Three Clarities’ halls sealed in snow.\nDark fields and plains reveal jade steeds,\nThe palace’s eaves trail golden dragons in concealment.\nAmid the cold crags, the lofty one stands—\nWhich distant peak is the first, the second, or the third?\n\n**The Bamboo Pavilion of the Great Void Abbey**\nThis small pavilion’s secluded balustrade bears no flowers,\nOnly jade-green bamboo, sovereign of the year’s splendor.\nIts upright stalks are no common grass or tree,\nIts hollow heart truly befits the Daoist’s livelihood.\nThe wind’s soughing brings a chill fragrance,\nThe rain’s cleansing leaves it purer still.\nIt need not wait for the year’s cold to prove its worth—\nBy my chanting window, morning and night, it embodies flawless integrity.\n\n**Reflections on Climbing Heights**\nI urge my horse up the high ridge, its hooves unsteady,\nGazing upon the vast earth, my heart trembles.\nMountains and rivers stretch boundless to the sky,\nGrotto heavens and immortals dwell far from the world.\nWhite jade and yellow gold are never truly held,\nSpring blossoms and autumn moons are never truly possessed.\nA hundred years pass like a fleeting dream of floating life—\nAll things prove illusory, leaving only regret’s desolation.\n\n**Two Poems for Master Liu Shiru**\nPrefect of Dinghai Commandery, retired from office, Master Liu Shiru visits with his son at the Great Void Abbey in Qixia.\n\n**I**\nSeveral riders lightly depart the prefectural city,\nThe west wind sways, chrysanthemums gleam pure.\nReciting poems on horseback, no lance in hand,\nI seek the Dao among men, briefly washing my cap strings.\nDew falls, the sky soars, autumn’s air is crisp,\nGolden chimes and jade vibrations brighten the dawn clouds.\nAll day in the mountain hall, I sit in tranquil solitude—\nAs if sensing the floating life’s dream grow faint.\n\n**II**\nMaster Shiru has a retreat for rest and repose, named the Central Chamber.\nHe further requests a poem.\n\nThat which is called the Dao is the interplay of yin and yang,\nExcess or deficiency alike miss the mean.\n\n**The Dao Encompasses the Three Vehicles**\nThe Dao encompasses the Three Vehicles, its mystery unfathomable,\nAt its center it embraces the myriad existences, its essence boundless.\nThe lofty man, though yet unenlightened, still seeks seclusion,\nWhile the lesser scholar, once awakened, casts off ignorance.\n\nThe founders of the Three Teachings—Confucian, Buddhist, Daoist—\nFrom ancient times to now, a thousand sages share one source.\n\n**Matching Rhymes in Reply to Prefect of Fengsheng Commandery, Yila Zhongze’s Fine Verse**\nNo need for idle chatter, abandoning worldly schemes,\nThe great hermit need not dwell in a humble hut.\nThe ocean’s reflection shines, swallowing the jeweled moon,\nThe heart of heaven illuminates all things, outshining the cold pool.\n\nIn the *Yellow Court*, elegant strains rise in tripled melody,\nIn the *Purple Palace*, lofty verses flow with half-drunken joy.\nO learned governor of the northwest, master of letters—\nWould you deign to send your pearls and jade to the southeast?\n\n**Seeing Off Prefect of Penglaizhou, Zou Yingzhong, Transferred to Yanzhou**\nSince ancient times, few live to seventy,\nYet your deeds shine bright before twilight’s decline.\nYou long to retire, to plant chrysanthemums and depart,\nBut the imperial staff still commands, thwarting your heart’s desire.\n\nYour course remains bound by the reckoning of yin and yang,\nDay and night, you cannot escape the workings of change.\nOne day, when you doff your cap, do so early—\nLest those in the groves have cause to mock your delay.\n\n**In Praise of the Dao**\nCreation’s grandeur sways in boundless might,\nThe Three Luminaries turn through primal chaos day and night.\nIn darkness, yin and yang converge in splendor,\nIn wondrous transformation, spirits soar in myriad forms.\n\nSpring departs, autumn arrives—life and death diverge,\nYet heaven endures, earth persists, ancient and now the same.\nWithin the numinous terrace lies a true message—\nWithout awakening, how can one’s nature be unobstructed?\n\n**The Enlightened Scholar**\nAdapting to circumstances, he meets the world yet remains dust-free,\nResponding without fixed form, his inner spirit attains mastery.\nHis mind transcends the three realms’ suffering,\nRoaming the grotto-heavens, he enjoys eternal spring.\n\nThe Golden Elixir, the great medicine, ripens over years,\nFire-jujubes and celestial pears renew with each passing day.\nOne dose ensures transcendence beyond life and death’s plum—\nWho, then, is the destined one?\n\n**Viewing Pear Blossoms at Lingxu Abbey**\nThis wondrous sight, they say, belongs to the martial temple,\nAs the heavens revolve, we behold it in late spring.\nA thousand trees of white brocade, frost congealed as snow,\nA single breeze of fragrance breathes forth musk and orchid.\n\nFeathered guests wander, ascending the moonlit pavilion,\nLofty immortals descend, as if from the starry altar.\nThe abbey’s numinous beauty silently takes form—\nTransformed into boundless fragments of scattered jade.\n\n**Former Travels**\nThe road through Qin’s plains and Wei’s waters was fair,\nNo need to ask of long pavilions or short.\nWhen clouds part over Western Peak, the Immortal’s Palm gleams white,\nWhen rain passes Southern Mountain, the Buddha’s Crown shines green.\n\nThe cinnabar dawn seems to unfurl its morning hues,\nJagged emerald peaks stand like painted screens.\nFriends beyond the sea, hearing of my Dao,\nListen with open hearts, ears inclined.\n\n*End of Volume One of the* Panxi Collection\n*Volume Two of the* Panxi Collection\n\n**Seven-Character Quatrains by Qiu Chuji, the Ever-Spring Master of Mount Qixia**\n\n**[Ritual Rectification]**\nThe folk of Guanzhong are simple and sincere,\nMany incline toward goodness.\nDaoists revere the seventh [month],\nBuddhists turn the eighth [wheel].\nEach year’s end, they gather in great numbers,\nAfter noon, before the sacred icons, they chant scriptures and repent—\nThis is called *Ritual Rectification*.\nOnly when the month concludes does it end.\n\nSnow clears, spring’s light reveals great peace,\nWind gentle, sun warm—all the brighter.\nSing high in assembly, cast off melancholy,\nBoil round cakes crisp for *Ritual Rectification*.\n\n**In Reply to Scholar Fan**\nAsk not how the threads of fate are woven,\nOnly cultivate hidden virtue, thoughts ever renewed.\nHuman sentiments shift like the Dao of immortals—\nIn daily practice, exert all your strength.\n\n**For Daoist Friend Liu the Second**\nThis man loves wine and chess.\nWhen merry, he drinks a thousand cups of wine,\nIn stillness, he plays a game of chess.\nWhite-haired years should serve as a distant mirror,\nRed-dust trifles—know them not too well.\n\n**Two Poems Admonishing Qiang of Jingyang**\nSu Qin, Lu Jia—all return to emptiness,\nThrough the ages, the wise wake from one dream.\nHow much better to forget cunning and seal the lips,\nSilently seize the nine-heaven wind!\n\nA hundred years, ten thousand affairs—all a void,\nSwift as a fleeting shadow through a crack.\nWhy do men of the floating world not awaken?\nFoolish hearts still grasp at spring’s breeze.\n\n**To Layman Yang the Fifth**\nI wished to send a poem, but paper was lacking,\nSifting through scrolls, I found an old letter.\nAfter it, I earnestly inscribed a quatrain,\nUrging you: do good, do not hesitate.\n\n**Returning the Paper Fan Bestowed by Yang the Fifth**\nGrateful for your gift of white banana-leaf fan,\nIn mountain valleys, winds rise without summons.\nIn the city’s scorching days, no cool air comes—\nI beg you, hold it and leisurely wave.\n\n**In Reply to Scholar Qiao**\nNewly widowed, he seeks to still his heart and enter the Dao.\nBeyond the world, his heart returns, cutting off the great demon,\nIn leisure, he sings even more loftily.\nThe mind’s terrace now bears few desires,\nHis sturdy bones will ride the wind in days to come.\n\n**Inscribed on Yang the Fifth’s Paper Fan**\nTowering peaks press against the heavens,\nPrecipitous cliffs, distant mists clinging.\nSince ancient times, visitors to Mount Song,\nHaughty immortals of Mount Hua.\n\n**Inscribed on Scholar Wang’s Paper Fan**\nI love the boundless sky, summer days long,\nWho hates the cruel heat, the blazing clouds?\nThe triple-burner’s toxic heat, years of it, now gone—\nOne grasp of cool wind brings eternal chill.\n\n**Inscribed on Scholar Qiao’s Paper Fan**\nFiery sun, flying clouds of flame,\nWayfarers on the road bathe in sweat.\nIn the deep green caves of the mountains, carefree guests\nRecline beneath pines, playing chess at ease.\n\n**Inscribed on Wang the Second’s Paper Fan**\nAfter the *Ruibin* [fifth lunar month] heat grows fiercer,\nToxic warmth steams, nowhere to hide.\nOnly in the emerald caves of Ever-Spring Mountain\nDoes coolness linger all day, naturally serene.\n\n**Inscribed on Zhou Daoquan’s Paper Fan**\nStream winds sigh like descending frost,\nGully waters ripple like churning snow.\nAll day, no toil or burden weighs—\nWhen will stifling heat return?\n\n**Inscribed on Madam Pang’s Rattan Fan**\nDelicate patterns woven in silver threads,\nGentle breezes scatter jade-like grace.\nThough autumn’s gales bring crispness,\nFor you, it will not be long.\n\n**Chen Family Thatched Hall by the Luo River**\nA thatched hall stands high in half the grove’s shade,\nTall trees, uneven, deep green bamboo.\nNo sound of carriages or horses—fame and profit far,\nIn quietude all day, the heart finds rest.\n\n**Scholar Duan’s Raft Lost to Rising Waters**\nScholar Duan launched his raft down Western Mountain,\nJust as waves surged, sweeping all beyond the pass.\nTurning back, he bore no grudge against the River

hindrance,\nThey soar through the eight directions, freely roaming.\n\n**Painting of Zhong and Lü**\nNo self, no other—nature free,\nMaster and disciple converse in harmony.\nExpounding scriptures, teaching Dharma on the three mountains,\nRiding mists, soaring clouds, a thousand miles they roam.\n\n**Two Poems on Dwelling in Mount Jingfu**\nTigers roar in fierce winds, beasts startle,\nDemons meet in long nights, sleep’s soul trembles.\nWhen will the simple and upright Dao-heart appear?\nThe sun of wisdom dawns, the heavenly eye opens.\n\nJingfu’s depths, worldly affairs few,\nDragon Gate’s tranquility, Tiger Creek’s clarity.\nAt times, the cry of the red pheasant—*jieguo jiazha*—\nLike the creaking of an axle’s lock.\n\nA kind of red pheasant in the mountains\nMakes the sound *jieguo jiazha*.\nWoodcutters entering the hills\nJoke that it is \"snow settled.\"\nThe descending call turns to *goujia gezhe*—\nThe partridge’s cry.\n\n**Four Poems Expressing My Aspirations**\nI seek the Dao, letting my spirit roam free,\nAt Dragon Gate, tigers now and then intrude.\nOn mountain peaks, fierce fires blaze in midwinter,\nIn ravine depths, yin winds chill the fifth month.\n\nThe subtle principle of pure emptiness spans the world,\nThe great simplicity’s honest breeze fills the age.\nThe supreme Dao has a name—where is its reality?\nThe enlightened speak not, yet know and return.\n\nThe root of entering the Dao lies in self-commitment,\nWho knows the message of transcending the dust?\nFirst, *Nanhua* brings carefree joy,\nFinally, the boundless sea meets its vast appointment.\n\nWild cranes, solitary clouds—my livelihood,\nCool winds, bright moon—my Daoist life.\nA thousand mountains, piled high, gather cloud and mist,\nThe four seas, radiant, gleam with sunlight.\n\n**Four Poems on Yang of Longzhou Bringing Moon Osmanthus to Visit**\nBuried in dust, how pitiable,\nFollowing worldly ways for years.\nBy chance, a noble scholar roams hills and waters,\nMeeting lofty immortals, companions of sages.\n\nA lone branch, elegant, leans on cold mountains,\nAll flowers of the four seas bow in shame.\nIf it meets a fine wind and auspicious air,\nHeavenly fragrance will drift through the world.\n\nFrom first breath, it received the true essence,\nPassing on splendor, linking fragrance like fire.\nAmong the world’s hundred flowers, none rivals the moon,\nOnly this can endure through the ages.\n\nDense trees, high mountains, hidden in the earth,\nMany winds, little dew—fearing the cold sky.\nOne day, it will return to the Moon Palace,\nWhere the five peaks gather clouds, the four seas gaze.\n\n**Releasing a Hawk**\nLet it fly, rivaling Zhi Dun’s crane,\nNever cage it like Wang Xizhi’s goose.\nThough it matches Zhuangzi’s \"crying for justice,\"\nBeware it learns Mao’s immortal’s love-demons.\n\n**Clear Dream Pavilion in Longzhou Hall**\nIn Clear Dream Pavilion, pure scholars dwell,\nIn tranquil leisure, they nurture true suchness.\nWhen true suchness is nurtured, dreams grow clear,\nDreamless, pure joy abounds.\n\n**Reply to Magistrate Xiao of Longzhou’s Summons**\n\nParting from Long Mountain on business,\nI passed through Tingchuan to Shihui Temple,\nlingering for days—my resolve yet unformed.\nThen your letter arrived, and joyfully I returned.\nSoon came word of your honored appointment at the Qianyuan frontier,\nand I longed to rest in quietude beneath Longxi’s skies.\nThe yellow crane scorns a thousand-mile flight,\nwhile white clouds still cling to their old mountain perch.\n\n**Gazing Back at Longmen Mountain from the Road After Returning from Tingchuan**\n\nSouthward, Longmen gapes wide in a single cleft,\nas the crane-borne immortal turns his head once more.\nDeeply I know this place’s weight of karmic ties—\nno other land could encompass such virtue and power.\n\n**Reply to the Recluse of Rest-and-Rest, Summoned by Princess Cao**\n\nMountains and hidden ravines are no mark of

Dao,\nyet the Daoist’s comings and goings are full of error.\nYou must tread the rugged path through mountain prefectures,\nvigilant lest heterodox demons arise.\n\n**Sent to Magistrate Rong of Fufeng**\n\nWhen the heart is true, even fish scales grow vast;\nwhy begrudge a horse’s bones their towering height?\nIf your dwelling holds sincerity, trust will follow—\nwithout wisdom, descending

for Lord Yuyang**\n\nThree poles high, the sun sleeps at ease;\nten thousand acres of white clouds idle in pairs.\nI only fear that hollow fame may stir the palace halls,\ndisturbing my high-pillowed

remedy.\nOne must endure the full measure of prosperous years’ retribution,\nthen ascend to peace and enter the Dao’s precincts.\n\n**Fourteen Poems on Gong Mountain**\n\nI composed these verses on the southern slopes of Gong Mountain, my homeland.\n\nGong Mountain looms, piercing the azure vault;\npine shadows dense, sealing the emerald sky.\nAtop its crown, I wear pine blossoms, eat pine seeds,\ndrink by the pine stream beneath the moon, sipping pine winds.\n\nPine winds sigh through pine mist,\nthe sighing mist disperses through the nine heavens.\nBeyond the sky, lightly veiling all things,\nthey mingle with sun and moon in shared revolution.\n\nA thousand-fathom waterfall, bright and graceful;\na single sweep of misty light, majestic in force.\nAt times, auspicious winds blow it into rain,\na drizzling vastness that scatters into empty space.\n\nThough Qingcheng, Huashan, and Tiantai stand tall,\nhow can they compare to my mountain’s grandeur?\nA cluster of peaks, ten thousand fathoms high—\nits majesty truly rivals Penglai.\n\nGong Mountain’s heights cradle the White Cloud Palace,\nthe palace pressing upon the mountain’s foremost peak.\nAbove the peak, white clouds drift ceaselessly,\nleisurely coming and going, entwining the green pines.\n\nMountain hues waver between presence and absence,\nhalf dissolving into dark depths, half into the void.\nVaguely at the sky’s edge, yet nowhere to be found—\never drifting, ever shrouded in white clouds.\n\nSince ancient times, Gong Mountain has known many white clouds,\nlayer upon layer forming a canopy into the Great Net.\nImmortal hosts appear and vanish unseen,\nonly the songs of grotto immortals heard amid the clouds.\n\nEthereal immortal songs enter Gong Mountain,\ngradually merging with the Great One’s altar.\nUpon the altar, immortals tend their cauldrons,\never refining the Great Return Elixir.\n\nStriking open the Milky Way to brush the stars,\nalone I sit in the Toad Palace, embracing the solar wheel.\nBy night I herd the sacred tortoise, by dawn I lead the crane;\nhungry, I eat pine nuts; cold, I wrap myself in clouds.\n\nAtop the mountain, I kindle a single lamp—\nall demons under heaven cease to stir.\nOnly the steadfast, enlightened adept\nwalks among the pines, playing with the luminous pearl.\n\n**Spring on Gong Mountain**\n\nLeisurely I send the Azure Dragon to gather moonlight,\ntogether driving the White Tiger to sow the Yellow Sprout.\nWhen the Yellow Sprout is about to burst forth,\nthunder shakes the earth—\nthe Azure Dragon and White Tiger’s fangs jut out.\n\n**Summer on Gong Mountain**\n\nSunlight spills like fire, clouds congeal;\nsea-bottom dragons coil, then ascend.\nGathering the triple summer’s heat from every mountain peak,\nthey transform it into a single sphere of water.\n\n**Autumn on Gong Mountain**\n\nClouds surge, rosy hues gleam on heaven’s thoroughfare;\npines dense, mountains high, pressing upon the earth’s map.\nAt the summit’s sheer pinnacle, none tread—\nonly the solitary moon shines, radiant and clear.\n\n**Winter on Gong Mountain**\n\nLayered clouds stretch boundless, snow falls thick;\nbitter winds howl, scraping the earth with force.\nThey stir the mountain’s endless scenes—\njade flowers, coral petals fill the sky.\n\n**Twenty Odes on Laishan**\n\nLaishan in Donglai’s Jimo, encircled thrice by the sea,\nits back to the plains, colossal stones towering,\npeaks soaring—truly a grotto-heaven blessed land,\na realm of surpassing beauty in this corner of the world.\n\nYet remote at the sea’s edge, few in the world know it,\nand its name is not auspicious.\nAfter concluding my rites in Changyang, I arrived at Yongzhen Abbey in Wangcheng.\nGazing south through the mist, I glimpsed it faintly.\nThe Daoist community urged me to stay, and after several days’ delay, I finally reached it.\nThus I composed these twenty leisurely odes, renaming it Aoshan,\nto invigorate the winds of the Dao.\n\nAoshan rises boldly from the sea’s edge,\nits subtle numinous beauty filling heaven’s thoroughfare.\nPeaks carved like wax, thousands of fathoms high,\ncountless jagged rocks piercing the sky.\n\nThe Two Ancestral Palaces stand south, guarding the sea—\nnamely, the Supreme Clarity and Grand Clarity Palaces.\nThe Three Peaks of Wangming face north, blocking the road—\nthat is, the Taiping Xingguo Abbey south of the Dao.\n\nKnow then that this immortal realm beyond the world\ndoes not deign to be mapped in daylight.\n\nAt first, the mountain’s hues wavered between presence and absence;\nten days passed in delay, yet I had not arrived.\nA grotto-heaven so near, yet unreachable—\nonly my poems filled my satchel.\n\nFloating mists, layered greens—this mountain city,\nridges and peaks stacked like painted screens.\nCreation set its marker here, eastward resting on the sea,\nwhere clouds unfurl and rosy hues swirl as the sun darkens.\n\nThreefold the sea, one level field—\nbelow it anchors the golden turtle, above it meets the sky.\nDay and night, tide winds roll like snow,\nand amid deep rosy clouds, flying immortals dwell.\n\nA blessed mountain, a land of fortune, veiling immortals—\nten thousand ravines, a thousand cliffs, sealing the grotto court.\nCreation did not place it along the great road,\nfor it disdains the world’s foul stench.\n\nLaishan is none other than Aoshan,\nunclimbable at the sea’s heart.\nThe Lord on High wished to perfect the Dao’s fruit,\nso he moved the immortal traces near to humankind.\n\nLayered ridges, repeated peaks—towering and jagged,\ncloud-mountains dazzle the eye, emerald heaped upon emerald.\nThe path winds three hundred turns around the mountain’s waist—\nwith each step, the traveler lingers, loath to proceed.\n\nPines and crags rise steep, auspicious mist drifts light,\ngrotto-palaces lie deep, their qi and aspect pure.\nStrange rocks and jagged peaks—who wrought their change?\nFrom primal creation’s dawn, heaven shaped them so.\n\nWith brush and ink I sought to capture their form,\nclimbing those high ridges, twenty tiers in all.\nSouthward, vast plains stretch a thousandfold,\neach layer of cliff crowned by another peak.\n\nAt the fourth watch, the mountain births the moon, still slanting,\nI ascend the eastern peak to watch the dawn’s rosy clouds.\nSunlight adorns the sky, bright upon the sea,\ngolden rays strike the eye, dazzling like blossoms.\n\nHeaven’s Pillar Peak stands towering, solitary,\npiercing clouds and mist to enter the azure vault.\nI know not when sun, moon, and stars fade,\nonly that yin and yang’s seasons harmonize.\n\nA grotto bears the fine name White Dragon Grotto—\nI know not which age concealed immortal traces.\nTo this day, through ten thousand ages of human change,\nit still nestles ‘gainst the crags, facing ancient pines.\n\nAnother grotto holds the immortal name Old Lord’s Grotto—\nits spirit clear, its qi fresh, peerless in transcendence.\nFrom on high, I gaze down upon the blue-green sea,\nguarding stillness, at ease, facing white clouds.\n\nMaster Hua Gai, who attained the Dao in Song Taizu’s time, ascended to the azure heavens,\nand from that day, the Dao-mountain’s purity stood eminent.\nEven now, beneath sheer cliffs and secluded crags,\nimmortals still gather to listen to the sea’s tide.\n\nA cultivator, rustic wanderer, no man of letters,\nyet upon reaching Aoshan, even I compose verse.\nI seek only to behold the grotto-heaven’s sea and sun,\nno need for cloud and rain, nor prayers in blue-green script.\n\nWhite-haired, careworn, yet unfinished as an immortal,\nI wander mountains and rivers, lingering in delight.\nI do not mind the heavens’ many offices,\nonly fear the world’s vulgar ties.\n\nCultivation is like climbing a mountain—arduous,\neach step hard-won, each step higher.\nIf the heart’s resolve does not falter or flag,\none may ascend to heaven and pluck the immortal peaches.\n\nAoshan’s three sides float upon the sea,\nas the sun rises from Fusang, gilding the waves red.\nVast and boundless, azure waves stretch a thousand leagues,\nall turned to gold, suffusing the mountain’s east.\n\nMountains and rivers belong to the Dao’s livelihood,\nthe ten thousand forms, all one family.\nWere it not for sages’ hidden governance,\nhow could heaven and earth long endure their splendor?\n\nI sigh at creation’s majestic work,\nmountains, rivers, and earth stand in empty space.\nHow much fills the eight wastes and four seas?\nAll rests within the one qi of Primordial Harmony.\n\n**Twenty Poems Revisiting Laishan**\n*Composed in the year Da’an Jisi, after the Jiao rites in Jiaoxi, when Daoist companions invited me to revisit Aoshan, and I again inscribed twenty poems.*\n\n**Ten Poems at Shangqing Palace**\nReturning from the rites, I sought the Dao-mountain,\ndeep in the wilds, where the sea’s bays encircle.\nBoarding a boat, I turned toward the waves,\nand there, amid misty vapors, Penglai took form.\n\nPeaks rise sheer, overhanging the abyss,\ntheir lofty summits lean against the sky.\nThe blue-green sea, ancient and everlasting, swallows sun and moon,\nwhile the azure mountains, morning and evening, birth clouds and mist.\n\nGreen mountains are the Daoist’s true home,\nand here, this immortal mountain nears the sea’s edge.\nThe sea vast, the mountain high—no filth or foulness,\nclouds deep, the land secluded—all the more refined.\n\nStrange rocks, hollowed by time, shaped by nature,\na thousand marvels, ten thousand forms—beyond naming.\nSheer cliffs, unvisited by men,\nyet day and night, strains of immortal music drift.\n\nAt dawn, the sun veiled, clouds begin to rise,\nthe mountain’s hues somber, not yet fully revealed.\nOne must climb higher to see from the peak—\nas if riding heaven’s winds, leaving the dust behind.\n\nMassive boulders stand in ranks upon the ridge,\nthe summit’s perilous heights—no path remains.\nIn late autumn, waters freeze, layered ice congeals,\nin the ninth month of summer, clouds chill, peaks shrouded in haze.\n\nViewing the mountain from the sea, its grandeur shifts,\nits purity and loftiness jut into empty space.\nFrom dawn to dusk, boulders birth clouds,\nall transformations wrought by creation’s hand.\n\nIn the west, renowned mountains like Huayue are rare,\nin the south, wonders like Jiuhua stand alone.\nAoshan cradles the Eastern Ocean,\nits beauty surpassing all in Shandong—yet unknown.\n\nPeaks upon peaks, overlapping, concealing,\nclustered, thronging, vying in splendor.\nThe eye finds cool clarity, the heart’s ground is refreshed—\nsince ancient times, immortal mountains have been the finest livelihood.\n\nI have wandered the Five Peaks, journeyed the Four Sacred Mountains,\nyet no range can compare.\nOnly because it lies at the sea’s edge, the sky’s rim,\nhas its lofty name not resounded through the Nine Provinces.\n\n**Ten Poems at Taiqing Palace**\nLeaving Shangqing Palace, mist and haze part,\nthe dawn’s light faint, the path barely discernible.\nArriving below, before men have eaten,\nI sit and behold the mountain and sea—a vast expanse.\n\nClouds and mist dim, rain falls in fine drops,\nthe stone grotto detains me, will not let me go.\nPerhaps the grotto-heaven takes pity,\nlamenting how rarely I come.\n\nThe cloud-sea stretches boundless, no shore in sight,\nonly the tide’s crest, waves churning like blossoms.\nHigh peaks, a thousand folds, linked in cloud-borne beauty,\none cluster forms a screen—this is the Daoist’s home.\n\nPine winds, stream waters—both pure and secluded,\ntheir clear sounds fill the day, cease not even at night.\nWild cranes come and go, never weary,\nwhile idle visitors wish to depart, yet are urged to stay.\n\nThe stream runs deep, stones lie vast, pines grow thick,\nlush and verdant, the Dao’s qi harmonious.\nWere it not for years of woodcutters’ toil,\nfloating clouds would veil the sun, filling the crags’ recesses.\n\nA name renowned through the ages, soaring with the clouds,\nthe mountain-wandering scholar stands apart.\nImmortal lords, noble as the Three Mao Masters,\nofficial clans, honored as the Ten Thousand Stone House.\n\nGazing west, the mountain pierces the sky,\nwhere immortals’ homes cultivate the azure peach.\nHow many times has the peach ripened, while men change worlds?\nIn the grotto, Qin’s maidens grow fur upon their bodies.\n\nClear songs, delicate as the void’s steps, rise in unison,\nbeneath the moon, high chants, phoenix dances dip low.\nTheir laughter and talk touch not the floating world’s affairs,\ntogether they pass straight beyond the Ninth Heaven’s west.\n\nPurple and emerald mists, white clouds soaring high,\nin grotto-palaces, immortals feast on jade peaches.\nDrums echo through the azure cliffs, thunder shakes in fright,\nand all the mountain’s birds and beasts cry out in chorus.\n\nThe Dao’s power, divine work—beyond words,\nalone it transcends, shaping the ten thousand transformations.\nMountains and seas know their weight,\nwhile the bottomless void floats for ten thousand years.\n\n**Fifteen Poems on the Mid-Autumn Festival**\n*Composed on the tenth day of the eighth month, returning from Changle County to the Yuqing Abbey north of Weizhou city.*\n\nFrom the western county, eastward to Yuqing,\nthe golden wind sweeps the evening sky clear.\nI open my heart to welcome the Mid-Autumn moon,\nonly fearing clouds may dim its brightness at the hour.\n\nThe western wind stirs through the ten thousand trees of the Nine Provinces,\nthe cold light of night flows westward in a single stream.\nThe air beyond the dust cleanses to the bone,\nand everywhere, songs and joy refuse to let one linger.\n\nAt first parting the sea’s ridges, a lingering clarity remains,\nthe hearts of ten thousand lands rejoice in grand peace.\nMay the precious radiance know no wax nor wane,\nand heaven’s essence never suffer gain or loss.\n\nLike unrefined gold and jade upon the celestial thoroughfare,\nembracing snow and congealing frost, it illumines the great void.\nThe four seas and hundred rivers all reflect its light,\nwhile the myriad beings and forms dwell in tranquility.\n\nA single expanse of pure light unfurls for ten thousand miles,\nno distinction between thatched huts and towering halls.\nEvery household delights in leisurely verse and admiration,\nwhile a fresh breeze lends its aid to joy unbounded.\n\nA traveler lingers, gazing toward the vast heavens,\nraising a cup, intent on savoring the moon’s glow.\nYet the moon’s light knows not how to detain the heart,\nfaintly drifting through the azure sky, serene and self-contained.\n\nGolden waves never rest day or night,\ntheir gentle, clear radiance emerging from sea and mountain.\nThe pale orb ascends, wandering beyond all things,\nits gracious light descending to bathe the human realm.\n\nThe azure firmament’s majesty has its appointed time,\nheaven’s light shines impartially by nature.\nYet I fear the lower world’s heavy darkness of delusion,\nobscuring the moment when the golden wheel appears.\n\nRound and bright, the moon hangs in the empty sky,\neven a hundred-fold refined bronze mirror cannot compare.\nIn every body of water, its reflection appears,\ndissolving the gall of all demons, leaving none untouched.\n\nThe hazy shadow of the osmanthus drifts down to illuminate mortals,\nspanning the ages, its cause unknown.\nWhen shall I ride a crane to the clouds above,\nand gaze down upon the azure heavens and the white jade wheel?\n\nClouds come and go without pause,\ndawn and dusk shift between clarity and gloom.\nTonight, fortunate to behold this beauty,\nI compose new verses to express the Dao’s sentiment.\n\nYear after year at this time, lives are taken in great number,\nheaven-piercing karma arises—what can be done?\nYet thanks to our sovereign’s strict prohibition,\nall beings’ lives find peace and harmony.\n\nThe sagely ruler ascends the throne, and all things are at rest,\na benevolent wind curbs killing, beginning at court.\nLords and commoners alike cultivate virtue,\nthat the moon’s radiance may shine upon all.\n\nIn the stillness of night, dark clouds arise,\nnone among the living share in heaven’s true joy.\nYet it is only the clouds that veil the eyes in the sky—\nbeyond the heavens, the moon has never shunned mortals.\n\nA hundred years of time pass in an instant,\nhow many Mid-Autumns bring a moment of leisure?\nBetter to refine one’s nature like the autumn moon,\nits clarity and brightness bringing ease to body and mind.\n\n*End of Volume Two of the Panzhou Collection*\n*Panxi Collection, Volume Three*\n\n**Songs and Hymns by Qiu Chuji, the Ever-Spring Master of Mount Xi**\n\n**[Song of the Azure Heavens]**\nAzure heavens, let no drifting clouds arise,\nfor clouds that rise obscure the myriad forms.\nThe myriad forms arrayed repel a hundred evils—\nwhen light fails to shine, demon-kings prevail.\n\nAt first, I swept the skies and earth to clarity,\na thousand gates and ten thousand doors sang of great peace.\nYet sometimes a single black cloud would rise,\nand the nine apertures and hundred bones knew no peace.\n\nThus I ever kindle the fierce wind of wisdom,\nsweeping through the Three Realms and Ten Directions.\nWhen clouds disperse, the void’s true body appears,\nand naturally, the moon shines in every home.\n\nBeneath the moon, one may play the flute,\na single resonant note subduing Hua and Yi.\nStartled, the Jade Lad of the East rides forth,\nastride a white deer, swift as a shooting star.\n\nPresently, another melody arises—\nneither sheng nor horn, yet of a kind.\nA three-foot cloud-zither with twelve studs,\ncarved through kalpas by the Primal One.\n\nJade-like tones, pure and clear, surpassing Zheng’s music,\nlight and penetrating, reaching the hearts of the enlightened.\nSince I attained this, ghosts and spirits lend aid,\nascending to heaven, descending to earth, transcending past and present.\n\nUnfettered, unbound, my heart seeks no glory,\nmy body knows no disgrace.\nAt leisure, I sing the *White Snow* within the gourd,\nin stillness, I tune the *Yangchun* beyond the world.\n\nThis music of mine arises naturally—\npipes without holes, zithers without strings.\nAwakened from the dream of floating life,\nday and night, pure sounds fill the cavern-heaven.\n\n**[Six Hymns]**\n\n**Hymn of the Primordial**\nIn the quiet of an empty mountain’s night, faint clouds form,\na pale moon, sparse stars, and the cold qi intermingle.\nSuddenly, the Long Star gleams in the great void;\nturning, I see the Northern Dipper hidden in the vast expanse.\n\nHeaven and earth shift from gloom to brightness in an instant,\nthe cosmos in turmoil—what does it rely upon?\nThere must be a mechanism, silently moving,\nrevolving in emptiness, reciprocating endlessly.\n\nGreat indeed is the boundless, mysterious Dao of the Primordial,\nwhat does it not nurture with its numinous efficacy?\nIt transforms the Three Luminaries, turning the skies azure,\nnourishing the myriad things, unfolding their blossoms and calyxes.\n\nSoaring through past and present, it never decays,\nenduring peril and hardship, yet never weakened.\nThe vast torrent surges and swells of its own,\nwho measures the great transformations?\n\nThe Primal Qi first stirs change,\nthe Supreme Honored One alone transcends all.\nTrampling the void, emerging from the unfathomable,\nsplitting open chaos, giving birth to radiance.\n\nYin and yang ascend and descend, forming gates,\nthe sun and moon traverse, serving as locks and keys.\nHeat departs, cold arrives; day and night divide,\ntimes flow and ebb, prosperity and decline take their turns.\n\nAbove, the pivot of heaven and earth is established,\nbelow, the bell of guidance resounds.\nVirtue is built according to place, things are measured by need,\nteachings are set forth in accord with the times, following human joy.\n\nThe Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors all revere it as their ancestor,\nthe Six Paths and Four Births all submit in assent.\nEven the sagely literary talent of Confucius began in ignorance—\nhow vast the Dao and virtue of the Hidden Dragon!\n\n**Hymn of Deliverance**\nDeep in the mountains, the path is secluded, few travelers pass,\nall day in the quiet crags, I listen to the birds’ cries.\nNo guests to accompany me beneath the bright moon,\nsometimes I stand alone above the azure clouds.\n\nAbove the clouds, my solitary chant drives a hundred evils far,\ngazing to the horizon, the mountains shrink to naught.\nThe tune soars, the wind swift, the melody lingering,\npure and transcendent, my steps ethereal, my spirit untethered.\n\nI recall the days when Chongyang roamed the corners of the earth,\nhis pure chant yearning to restore heaven and earth’s simplicity.\nHe cast his line in Fufeng, unknown to all,\nmeasuring the great sea, I alone foresaw.\n\nHis divine subtlety defies distinction,\nhis transcendent discourse is not what the world studies.\nLooking back today, the Dao stands lofty,\nonly now do I grasp the towering merit of those years.\n\nFirst, in Dongmou, he expounded benevolence and filial piety,\nyet could not transform the customs, lifting the veil.\nFive assemblies arose, each with its name:\nin Ninghai, the Golden Lotus; in Dengzhou, the Jade Splendor;\nin Laizhou, the Level Equality; in Wendeng, the Seven Treasures;\nin Fushan, the Three Lights.\n\nIn three prefectures, the three teachings flourished,\nhouseholds entered trance, spirits descended in dreams, people were astounded.\nDiscarding caps and crowns, I weighed my course.\nThe Master dwelt by the Eastern Sea, a hidden dragon;\nMa entered the Western Qin, transforming into a leopard.\n\nDanyang’s propagation of the Dao thrived in Shaanxi.\nIn the summer of the *jichou* year of the Dading era,\nI and several others, including Danyang,\nfollowed Master Chongyang from Wendeng to Ninghai.\nThe season turned to Dragon Spring, the sun’s heat grew intense.\n\nThe Master bade us go ahead while he held the umbrella behind,\nsome half a *li* distant.\nSuddenly, I turned and saw the umbrella soar into the sky.\nI hurried back to ask, and he said:\n“It was borne aloft by the whirlwind, I know not how.”\n\nAt first, the umbrella rose to the northeast,\nfloating gently, then fell among the sands.\nWe searched in the direction he pointed, but found nothing.\nAt that time, my Dharma kin, Huiyangzi Wang,\nwas secluded on Zha Mountain by the Eastern Sea’s edge.\n\nThe mountain lay one hundred and ten *li* from Wendeng,\nand Wendeng was seventy *li* from where the umbrella rose.\nThe umbrella ascended at the *chen* hour,\nand by dusk, it fell into the handle of Huiyang’s hut.\n\nHuiyang was his Daoist name,\nbestowed by the Master—a character not found in the *Pian Yun*.\nThe umbrella was later kept by the Zhai family below Zha Mountain,\nborrowed from Fan Mingshu of Ninghai.\nWhen Fan later learned of this and sought to reclaim it, they refused.\n\nAs for my discarding of the cap:\nWhen the Master first climbed the northern city to view the sea,\nhis bamboo-skin cap suddenly fell into the water and drifted away,\nonly to return later.\n*Qian* is pronounced like *zhu*.\n\n**Hymn of Carefree Wandering**\nThe Ten Isles and Three Mountains in the vast sea,\ncrimson towers and jade pavilions, soaring unevenly into the void.\nPine shadows densely veil, fearing no scorching sun,\nsilken fans still, yet a pure breeze arises.\n\nMolten gold’s heat—\nthe jade-belted immortals never speak of it.\nCrystal palaces open,\njeweled thrones arrayed with stars.\n\nThe azure void suspends images around the towers,\nthe pure and transformed body is not of flesh and blood.\nThis original body,\nnaturally attuned to the divine,\nin laughter and speech, suddenly startles the immortals of heaven.\n\n**Hymn of Ease**\nJade terraces and Penglai gardens in the azure vault,\nauspicious clouds and blessed qi, brimming and filling the sky.\nImmortals appear and vanish, scattering pure rain,\nthe myriad transformations unfold, stirring fragrant winds.\n\nThe scorching heat—\nwhere is there a household that has not spoken of it?\nMists withdraw, grotto-heavens open,\ngates stand aligned with the Milky Way.\n\nFrom time to time, the Nine Heavens host illustrious guests,\na thousand *li* away, no need to ride a sweating steed.\n\nBeyond the mundane, the body—\nnaturally pure in spirit—\nwho would envy those who climb towers, fanning themselves?\n\n**Ode Gazing at the Sea**\nI have observed the grandeur of the world’s terrain,\nand east of Tong Pass, north of the Huai River,\nnone surpasses Dengzhou.\nThus I compose *Ode Gazing at the Sea* to record its truth.\n\nPenglai lies secluded in the eastern corner,\nits grandeur unmatched beneath heaven.\nThe land borders the realm of immortals and sages,\nthe mountains rest upon the dens of fish and dragons.\nFrom on high, I gaze toward Xihe,\nmy vision stretching yet never reaching its end.\nVast and boundless, sky and sea merge,\nbillowing clouds and mist spill forth.\nLong winds stir the waves,\na thousand *li* of frosty snow surging.\nAscending the isles, I stand in lofty dominion,\nthe earth’s mounds lost in the vast expanse.\nAt times, the numinous *qi* harmonizes,\ntransformations beyond the ordinary unfold.\nMyriad scenes array in boundless splendor,\ntoo wondrous to describe.\n\nGreat indeed is the lord of a hundred rivers,\ndeep and clear, its depths unfathomable.\nWith the tides, it keeps its faithful rhythm,\nthrough the ages, it never runs dry in drought.\nBeside it, the ponds of mortal fields,\nscattered far and wide, lie open.\nCompared to its leviathan waves,\nthey are but frogs in a well—pitifully small.\n\nGazing across the level expanse, no shore in sight,\nit stretches boundless, majestic and pure.\nNo tributary muddies its waters,\nthrough ten thousand ages, it transcends birth and decay.\n\n**Ode of Immortal Wandering**\nBeyond the red dust of the mortal world,\nbetween the jade terraces and azure heavens,\nimmortals in the grottoes never age,\nwanderers beyond the clouds remain ever at ease.\nThe crimson phoenix sings from its cavernous nest,\nthe red hound barks by the alchemical railing.\nA maiden in blue delivers the imperial decree,\na white crane returns bearing a letter.\n\nFeasting at the banquet of the Jasper Grove,\npoems are composed by the feathered guests.\nIn the Golden Mother’s palace, songs resound,\non Jade Turtle Mountain, long whistles echo.\nFruits ripen once in three thousand years,\nthe tower spirals twelvefold in ascent.\nWhen will King Mu arrive?\nWhen will Dongfang Shuo climb?\nThe Lady of Guye’s skin remains pure,\nHe Xiangu’s beauty ever radiant.\nFeiqiong plunges into the moon’s cavern,\nNongyu adorns her hair with blossoms.\nThey command their chariots to roam the Three Isles,\nriding the winds past a hundred barbarian lands.\nThey circle the seas and mountains,\nleaping to ascend the gates of heaven.\nBoundless and empty, without limit,\ntheir soaring spirits never wane.\n\nTranscendent, they surpass the dharma-realm,\nno longer yearning for the mortal world.\n\n**Three Hymns in Praise of the Dao**\n\nThe former worthies and later sages differ not,\ndivergent schools share one source—transforming delusion.\nThe Supreme Unity’s chaos opens the door and window,\nmysterious truth points straight to heaven’s ladder.\n\n**Dispelling Delusion**\nThe words of others must not be heeded,\nonly one’s own heart may be rectified.\nIf swayed by others’ right and wrong,\none’s own merit and inner nature are undone.\n\n**Admonition to the Multitude: Curb Desire**\nOf life’s myriad toils,\nnone exceeds desire.\nIt not only severs the root of life,\nbut also consumes hidden virtue.\nTo curb this one thing\nsurpasses all other restraints.\nThose who yearn for the Dao and cultivate immortality\nhave ever held this as their standard.\n\n**Two \"Steps in Emptiness\" Hymns**\nVast and boundless, the teaching of true cultivation,\nbillowing forth from the gate of the world-transcending.\nThe former masters opened the door and window,\nthe returning steeds shook heaven and earth.\nA humble chamber, a secluded immortal abode,\nyet its lofty name resounded at the imperial gate.\nCloud companions and rosy-hued friends gather,\npaying homage to the honored one of the Great Void.\nPrecious incense forms cloud-script,\nbrilliant lamps cluster like nocturnal radiance.\nThe starry river first gleams,\nbells and chimes suddenly resonate.\nThe master of the rite upholds the auspicious gathering,\nwith reverent heart praying to the heavens above.\nThe various immortals deign to glance,\nreceiving and guiding from the august Sovereign of Emptiness.\n\n**A Lament for Emperor Shizong, with Preface**\nIn the spring of the wuyin year of the Dading era [1218], your servant Chji was summoned from Mount Zhongnan to the capital. There, he was bestowed with cap, sash, and robe, and awaited imperial command at the Temple of Eternal Longevity. Eleven days later, an edict appointed Chji as High Ritual Master to preside over the rites of the Wanchun Festival. On the first day of the fourth lunar month, he was moved to the official hermitage north of the city. Two days later, on jisi, by imperial decree, statues of the Three Masters—Chunyang, Chongyang, and Danyang—were sculpted for the hermitage, their adornments and offerings meticulously prepared.\n\nOn the eighteenth day of the fifth month, he was summoned to Evergreen Isle. In autumn, on the tenth day of the seventh month, he was again received in audience. There, he expounded the principles of heaven and humanity, much to the emperor’s satisfaction. As dusk fell, he took his leave. The following day, an imperial messenger presented a tray of peaches. Though Chji had abstained from tea and fruit for over a decade, he partook of one in gratitude for the imperial favor.\n\nAt the Mid-Autumn Festival, by imperial decree on another matter, he was permitted to return to the mountains, with an additional gift of one hundred thousand coins. He respectfully declined the latter.\n\nIn the spring of the *jiyou* year, as he passed through Shanzhou, he suddenly received the sorrowful imperial edict. At that time, the world was in turmoil, the sky and earth dimmed in pallor; officials and commoners alike donned mourning white. Though Qiu Chuji had cultivated the Dao beyond the worldly realm, dwelling still within the mortal sphere, how could he not be moved by the weight of imperial grace? He respectfully composed an elegy to express his sincerity:\n\n*The sorrowful edict descended from heaven,\nA mournful wind reached Shanzhou.\nThe Yellow River churned with frost and snow,\nThe sun veiled in dust and grime.\nI recalled the twilight of Evergreen Isle,\nWhere imperial favor twice renewed my years.\nA golden tray bore peaches for my partaking—\nSuch profound virtue now deepens my sorrow.*\n\n**Fifteen Poems on Swift Cultivation**\n\nDay after day, day upon day,\nThe fleeting light races like lightning.\nHeaven endures, earth persists, grinding through ages,\nSpring departs, autumn arrives, the seasons shift.\nThe great dream drifts, day and night indistinguishable,\nFloating life flickers, toiling or at ease.\nHuman attachments cling even to emptiness,\nMy aspirations soar, yet fear of loss remains.\nThe deluded soul wanders like one cast aside,\nThe heart, craving desires, clings to sweetness like honey.\nHow can one forget honey’s sweetness?\nThe pit of ignorance—when will one emerge?\nEmergence demands lofty conduct,\nCultivation of the pure tone brooks no false arts.\nOnly by dissolving self and other, near and far,\nCan gods and demons be powerless over fortune or misfortune.\nMy Dao-nature still blind,\nI dwell in a humble hut with purple doors, content in cramped space.\nHarmonizing light with dust, I follow the world’s right and wrong,\nResponding to sounds without contention.\n\n**Seeking a Patched Robe**\nIn the eighth month, he sent someone to the county to seek a tattered cloth sleeve-robe from Western Guo.\n\n*White dew wanes, cold dew gleams,\nMountain homes grow desolate, wanderers cease.\nYellow leaves fall from a thousand trees,\nMy hempen robe stitched with a hundred patches.\nOld cloth, weary from the seven-li market to the city,\nThe patched robe awaits winter’s snow.\nLet the city’s wealthy show their kindness,\nThat I may long dwell in seclusion by Pan Stream.*\n\n**Pine of Long Mountain**\nFor six years I dwelt on Western Mountain,\nWhere atop its western slope stood a solitary pine.\nMorning clouds, misty, brushed the passes,\nEvening rains, pattering, merged with the cavern-heavens.\nHeaven shaped this place as my companion,\nAcross the ravine, we kept distant company.\nLush and verdant, its qi and hue sublime,\nSoughing and rustling, the wind’s voice resounded.\nIntertwined branches cast layered shade,\nIts mandate endured a thousand years deep.\nYet in this year’s early spring,\nIt suddenly fell to the woodcutter’s axe.\nThe axe’s *ding-ding* echoed through valleys,\nThe pine’s smoke, mournful, darkened the mountain’s foot.\nI knew then heaven’s intent: I would soon depart,\nThus sent the sacred crag to fall before me.\nBy the numinous Xia Yu Temple—\nScenes fade, people scatter, what remains to recount?\nThe empty mountain dims, grieving the traveler.\nWhite cranes soar, losing their path,\nThe azure dragon lies prone, devoid of spirit.\nI know all phenomena are ultimately impermanent,\nAll forms bound by fate.\nSinging beyond the worldly, I return—\nThe greater hermitage in the dust deepens my awakening.\n\n**To Tangkuo Gu of Weiyang**\nShe was the younger sister of a former prime\n\nHere the rain pours axle-deep before the hour of *shen*,\nA thousand peaks grow dim, the four wilds thunder.\nThe flat earth swells three feet,\nThe great river swallows five watches of the night.\nDragons surge from ponds and marshes,\nDrought demons fill ditches and gullies.\nWhat remains of the Milky Way?\nFrom this day the celestial thoroughfare stands open.\n\n**Inscribed on the Zhaungzi Scroll in the Collection of Commissioner Liu**\nIllustrious Zong loved the Dao in his prime,\nHis hand traced the ancient forms of the *Nanhua*.\nA thousand years have passed since the *Nanhua* departed—\nWhat might its manner and spirit have been?\nOnly that men today revere the ancient Way,\nAnd in faint imitation drape its aura over their robes.\nThe perfected one’s breast originally held no waiting,\nTen thousand pores breathe freely with heaven’s wind.\nYang, Han, Ji, Ruan—each heart differed,\nYet all returned to the great clod.\n\n**A Winter Stroll Beyond the Suburbs**\nGrasses and trees withered,\nIce and frost bitterly cold.\nThe long sky—birds flown to the last,\nThe great sea—fish vanished without trace.\nMerchants’ boats lie idle,\nAll insects sealed in their burrows.\nWho beyond abundance\nCan loosen the grip of lonely poverty?\n\n**Autumn Wind on the Sea**\nA wanderer from Penglai has no home,\nHis body vows to learn

From birth, she possessed a nimble mind, deftly weaving silk threads into birds, fish, insects, flowers, and grasses—each form taking shape without need of pattern, flowing effortlessly from her hands. Her craftsmanship surpassed that of the living by far.\n\nAfter her husband’s death in middle age, she remained a widow, her devotion to the Dao profound. She built a hermitage and set out offerings to welcome the cloud-and-mist companions of the four directions, a practice she maintained for many years. Yet before long, frivolous tongues wove slanderous whispers, tarnishing her steadfast integrity like pine and bamboo besmirched by mud.\n\nRealizing the futility of clearing her name, she gathered her kin and, pointing to the withered catalpa in the courtyard, made this vow before the immortals: *\"If my conduct bears not the slightest fault, let this tree revive in glory. Should I prove false, I shall bear the shame alone and swear never to share the same sky and sun as you.\"* Months passed after her prayer, yet the tree showed no sign of life.\n\nThe villagers mocked her, jeering: *\"If this tree blooms again, not only will your virtue be proven, but we too shall grow rich and noble!\"* Madam Zhan heard their words as if in a spring dream.\n\nThat catalpa had been planted in the *gengzi* year of the Dading era (1180). No sooner had it taken root than it withered, battered by wind and rain for nearly five years until its form decayed beyond hope of revival. Yet in the summer of the following *jisi* year (1199)—the very month of Madam Zhan’s prayer—suddenly, a miraculous sprout emerged from the dead wood. Crimson as sacred grass, it stretched forth branches and lush leaves day by day, until its foliage shaded the courtyard steps.\n\nI first heard this tale while in Shaanxi, though I did not witness it myself. By the *xinhai* year of the Mingchang era (1191), as I passed through this prefecture, the streets and lanes still resounded with its praise.\n\nUpon lodging in Madam Zhan’s courtyard, I at last confirmed the truth of the matter. Six years have now passed since the tree’s revival. Its height spans twice a man’s reach, its branches and boughs luxuriant, unlike any common wood. Four lateral shoots emerge, sturdy and sinewy, their bearing lofty as if straining toward the clouds. Master Changchun observed: “Utmost sincerity moves things; luminous virtue stirs Heaven—does this not describe Madam Zhan? Who says the Dao is distant? The fault lies only in man’s failure to cultivate true virtue.” Thus I composed forty words to record this wondrous response.\n\n*On the day of...*\nOutsiders slander with idle tongues,\nYet with empty heart she prayed for proof.\nThe long catalpa’s roots had rotted,\nYet from withered stump, fresh shoots arose.\nMeng’s lament for yellow bamboo,\nTian Zhen’s sigh for purple brier—\nOf old, filial piety was praised;\nToday, loyalty stands revealed.\n\n**Reply to Meng’an of Guoxian County**\nEnamored of this land untouched by men,\nI soar high, freed from the crow’s cage.\nReciting poems to pass the idle days,\nObserving transformations in the still wind.\nStaff in hand, I roam south of Southern Mountain,\nSinging boldly east of Western Slope.\nHow many red-dust affairs exist?\nNone reach the realm of white clouds.\n\n**Reply to Scholar Li Si of Guoxian County**\nIn deepest winter, most carefree,\nShort days hasten my rounds.\nStanding alone beyond the red dust,\nI chant poems before emerald peaks.\nGlancing sideways at the cave’s mouth,\nMy bright gaze rests on mountain summits.\nGazing afar at snowy green peaks,\nBrilliant white mirrors the sky.\n\n**Visiting Huaidao Village South of Mount Zhongnan, Lodging in a Bamboo Garden**\nSeeking the Dao in Huaidao,\nMy feelings far from worldly passions.\nAt ease, my spirit soars;\nHalf-asleep, my dreams still stir.\nThe immortal’s courtyard, elegant in its scenery,\nJade groves bathed in moonlight’s clarity.\nA scholar truly finds delight—\nWhy cling to purple-robed honors?\n\n**In Praise of Master Changsheng**\nWhose blessed company do I keep?\nAmong immortals, who is most favored?\nThe eminent scholar of Donglai,\nThe renowned figure of Xiluo.\nLater, he received the ancestral teachings;\nHe was the last to leave the household,\nFirst to establish the model of Dao and virtue.\nDeeply he knew the power of youth,\nThus moved by sages’ support.\n\n**In Praise of Master Yuyang**\nA true immortal of the ancient land,\nA great man of the Eastern Realm.\nPure and lofty, how unlike the vulgar,\nBright and untrammeled, beyond worldly dust.\nInner and outer gifts bestowed by Heaven,\nHis conduct and retreat peerless in the age.\nTimely he discerns fortune and misfortune,\nHis proofs silently commune with the divine.\n\n**Inscribed at the Temple of the Great Duke of Panxi**\nOne scene unites high and low,\nThree peaks stand guard through ancient and modern times.\nThe path winds through cloud-washed caves,\nThe shrine nestles deep by the angling stream.\nFrom crevices, flying springs burst forth,\nAncient cypresses shade the sky.\nHow joyous this pure and secluded place—\nFit to gladden the heart of a rustic.\n\n**Spring Day Excursion**\nEmerging from the Hall of Azure Clouds,\nI turn and gaze across the eight wilds.\nClouds disperse, a thousand li made clear,\nWind scatters the fragrance of a hundred flowers.\nThe sea of desire stirs distant sorrows,\nSpring mountains awaken lasting delight.\nLeaning on my staff, the climb complete,\nI plunge deep into the land of intoxication.\n\n**First Snow**\nLast night’s rain turned to snow,\nThis morning the earth transformed to silver.\nThe window brightens, yet dawn has not come;\nThe wilds darken, yet dust is no more.\nFrom the sea, golden waves grow pale,\nAcross the sky, jade trees stand new.\nAt first sight, purity fills the eyes—\nEnough to stir the poet’s heart.\n\n**Autumn Rain**\nFor two nights, Heaven sends down rain,\nIn clear autumn, the earth swells with waves.\nGloom veils sun and moon,\nSurging waters swell rivers and streams.\nAt the Purple Frontier, returning geese bear sorrow,\nOn green mountains, recluses sing their songs.\nUnfazed, I dwell in my stone chamber,\nHigh-pillowed, chanting amidst mist and vines.\n\n**Leaving the Capital**\nJust beyond the imperial capital,\nI chant poems, my rustic spirit soaring.\nThe parrot, freed from its cage, is splendid;\nThe phoenix, spreading its wings, is wondrous.\nA white horse gallops lightly,\nGreen mountains drift slowly by.\nChang’an, a brocade of a thousand pieces—\nUndoubtedly, I shall arrive soon.\n\n**Ascending Western Mountain of Yizhou**\nLifting my robes, I tread barren ground,\nFrom the summit, I survey the autumn’s minutiae.\nDeep valleys plunge into dark abysses,\nJumbled peaks rise in towering layers.\nThe forest’s chill chills to the bone,\nMy eyes strain with the vastness.\nLaughing at this heartless wanderer,\nHow can I compare to the gibbons of cassia cliffs?\n\n**Inscribed at Mount Ai**\nA single dark cloud, cold and aloft,\nStands solitary amidst the distant haze.\nHeaven hangs over the vast blue sea,\nEarth anchors the leisurely white clouds.\nThough its name is hidden among the Five Peaks,\nThe path to the Three Spirits may yet be climbed.\nAt times, I observe stones transformed by touch,\nSweet dew anointing the dusty world.\n\n**Gazing Toward Kunlun**\nOnce I dwelled in Kunlun’s land,\nA single glance southeast brings joy.\nJade peaks array like sea and mountains,\nCloud brocade scatters like heavenly flowers.\nQi gathers, concentrating triple excellence,\nSpirit clears, surpassing the Nine Flowers.\nNow, as spring snow melts,\nMy eyes brim with cinnabar white.\n\n**Ascending Penglai Pavilion**\nOnce atop Penglai Pavilion,\nWith empty heart, I gaze into the distance.\nClouds shift, mountains seem to grow,\nWaters reach the sea and vanish.\nBelow, I peer into the dragons’ lair,\nBeside me, I watch the magpies’ bridge.\nWhy fear the distant, weightless ascent?\nThe cinnabar heavens lie close at hand.\n\n**Gazing at the Sea**\nSea’s hue swallows Heaven’s hue,\nWind’s voice mingles with water’s voice.\nClouds churn, startling fish and turtles,\nThunder roars, shocking gods and spirits.\nWaves surge against a thousand perilous cliffs,\nVast and boundless, a myriad li of calm.\nNow, without a fisher of giant turtles,\nWho will cast a line to hook the great whale?\n\n**Mountain Hall After Rain Clears**\nMorning sun, three poles high, shines bright,\nA thousand peaks stretch level in the distance.\nChanting high, my spirit grows ever freer,\nGazing far, my eyes grow ever clearer.\nAfter rain, the eaves drip with moisture,\nWind arrives, the seat grows cool.\nIf one’s heart is not aligned with the Dao,\nDo not let them pass my gate.\n\n**Two Poems on the Moon at Midnight**\n**I**\nThe midnight moon, steadfast and bright,\nWalks alone where none accompany.\nBelow, it joins the white of the blue sea,\nAbove, it fills the void with purity.\nIts traces leave the Three Isles,\nIts light roams, illuminating ten thousand cities.\nIn those cities, how many guests lie,\nToo deep in sleep to be stirred.\n\n**II**\nThe midnight moon, steadfast and bright,\nShines alone where none accompany.\nAt the sky’s edge, the Dipper dims,\nOn earth, a hundred evils take fright.\nWild cranes are faintly discerned,\nA host of dragons soar and cry.\nOn ordinary nights of the fifteenth,\nNever has it been so clear.\n\n**Early Winter: Rain Delays the Purchase of a Horse**\nIn the tenth month, torrential rain,\nAt the third watch, roaring waves.\nFloating clouds link sea and peaks,\nRushing waters flood the mountain city.\nWilds darken, wind and waves rage,\nMud deepens, roads collapse.\nTravelers and galloping horses alike\nRace through the night till dawn.\n\n**First Snow**\nAs the tenth month draws to a close,\nBy chance, I see the six-petaled snowflakes fly.\nScattered and swift in the whirling wind,\nIntricate and faint as night falls.\n\n**Mountains and Rivers as a Faint Screen**\nMountains and rivers like a pale bed-curtain,\nStars and constellations lose their pearl-like gleam.\nDawn’s light pierces the sky, so pure,\nSilver clouds dazzle the eye with radiance.\n\n**Spring Outing**\nOne night of spring wind brings warmth,\nBy the third watch, dawn’s sun glows bright.\nEvery mountain wears brocade,\nNo land but blooms with flowers.\nGolden Valley stirs deep feeling,\nPeach Blossom Spring is easily misjudged.\nTurning back, all is but a dream—\nI tell this to the Daoist’s household.\n\n**Two Poems on a Spring Night’s Rain**\n\n**I**\nMountain light remains cold and faint,\nScenery not yet arrayed.\nFine rain clings to all things,\nA gentle breeze touches no one.\nHarmony warms the third month,\nOne by one, a hundred flowers renew.\nLying in the quiet chamber at night,\nI idly chant of spring by the sea.\n\n**II**\nHow late the spring colors arrive—\nAt Clear Brightness, no flowers appear.\nOpening the window to watch emerald bamboo,\nBrushing soil to find golden sprouts.\nNight rain falls softly,\nA balmy breeze grows fair.\nAs the third month draws unevenly to a close,\nPeach and plum blossoms fill the horizon.\n\n**Cloud Peaks**\nIn the scorching ninth month of summer,\nA thousand mountains steam with sultry qi.\nSoaring space at first is vast and hazy,\nThen shifts in layers, ever-changing.\nTowering and sheer, fit for a painting,\nToo lofty for mortal ascent.\nWhen shall I ascend as an immortal,\nRiding a crane to soar above?\n\n**Rafting Timber with the Wind**\nLacking timber for the temple’s repair,\nThe master craftsman was ordered to raft logs from north of the sea.\nNear the shore, wind held them back for over ten days.\nIn autumn’s eighth month, on the ninth day,\nA southwesterly wind arose—\nThe rafts rode it at last to Jiaodong.\nAs the sun sets, the golden wind follows,\nTides level, the rafts set forth.\nCloud-sails race the shore in haste,\nDawn’s sun rises, gilding the sky.\nThough the north sea brings many trials,\nJiaodong is spared from great disaster.\nNo need to fear the grand hall unfinished—\nFine timber is already here.\n\n**Self-Portrait**\n\n**White Hair**\n\nWhite hair grows longer with the years,\nRosy cheeks fade day by day.\nFailing to grasp the Dao’s arts,\nI long to seek the pine and crane immortals.\nWhere to find the elusive spirit?\nHow to refine the returning elixir?\nFollowing the Three Caverns’ secrets,\nAll worldly ties dissolve at last.\n\n---\n\n**Quatrain**\n\n*Lantian*\nA thousand valleys unfurl like brocade,\nA thousand peaks stand as painted screens.\nAfter rain, the blue waters gleam white,\nClouds part to reveal jade mountains green.\n\n---\n\n**Returning to Mount Long (Two Poems)**\n\nThe crane’s nature loves the mountains,\nCloud-capped peaks wondrous in summer’s heat.\nTo escape the wind, it crosses the sea,\nAfter rain, it lingers not in pools.\nBeneath the tall pine it sits alone,\nBy jagged stones it chants in solitude.\nAt night it rides a crimson-crested crane,\nVisiting the immortals of the white clouds.\n\n---\n\n**On the Folly of Things (Two Poems)**\n\nHeaven births the ten thousand kinds,\nThe ten thousand kinds belong to Heaven.\nWhy does it permit cruelty and tyranny,\nDenying life its wholeness?\nYin and yang shape creation,\nLife and death alternate in rise and fall.\nMost piteous are the sentient beings,\nWho suffer hearts devoid of goodness.\n\n---\n\n**Autumn Night (Two Poems)**\n\nDew-laden air holds autumn’s crispness,\nHeaven’s light illumines the night.\nA waning moon dims over the ridge,\nDawn’s wind clears the stream.\nJade-like dew stretches through the endless night,\nThe Silver River gleams in autumn’s sky.\nWind carries the valley’s purity,\nMoonlight chills the celestial thoroughfare.\n\n---\n\n**Dawn (Two Poems)**\n\nThe Silver River shifts its hue,\nStars and constellations wheel in the void.\nA half-moon gleams pale and white,\nDawn’s glow blazes crimson for miles.\nCranes dance as night yields to dawn,\nA dream of wandering immortals startles awake.\nThe moon cradles the mountain, vast and growing,\nWind crosses the water, pristine and clear.\n\n---\n\n**Pure Joy (Two Poems)**\n\nThree winters spent roaming the seas,\nSix-petaled snowflakes blanket the earth.\nTo visit the grottoes of immortals,\nI pass by the homes of Daoist adepts.\nWine flows smooth as golden dew,\nTea steeps with the fragrance of jade mushrooms.\nSpirit refreshed, I grasp the three mysteries,\nHarmony dispels a hundred ills.\n\n---\n\n**Creation (Three Poems)**\n\nCreation wields divine transformation,\nForms fill the boundless cosmos.\nThe deluded suffer endlessly,\nEven sages cannot awaken them.\nThe primal chaos split in an instant,\nEmpty blossoms flourish through the ages.\nWondrous changes shift a myriad times,\nYet the Dao and virtue abide in mystery.\nA thousand flowers bloom in their season,\nThe three luminaries align in measured brightness.\nThe Nine Heavens’ palaces turn,\nThe eight directions arise\n\n**Creation (Three Poems, continued)**\n\nNot seeing desire before one’s eyes,\nOnly then does one know the heart’s emptiness.\nWith feeling, the Dao seems distant;\nWithout affairs, the mind feels vast.\n\nCreation opens the celestial cavern,\nThe spirit endures the biting cold.\nBoundless, the Three Realms stretch wide,\nProfound, the hundred evils run deep.\nThe Dao abides through all ages,\nYet living beings never fathom the heart.\nOf the five fortunes, only long life stands high;\nOf the three luminaries, only humans align.\n\nLeisurely I pass the years,\nUnfettered, unbound by dust.\nSages and worthies are not far from the Dao—\nVirtue lies in human cultivation.\nIf not sought within this heart,\nWhere else could it be found?\n\n---\n\n**Twenty Poems on Cultivating the Dao**\n\nEyes and ears depart from sound and color,\nBody and mind transcend being and non-being.\nNaturally, one communes with creation—\nWhy debate the fine or coarse?\n\nThe qi-refining, heart-cleansing adept\nSoars above the world, a towering standard.\nThe heart, steadfast as a mountain,\nQi, ceaseless as the tides.\n\nTen thousand cares melt like wax,\nThe three poisons dissolve like ice.\nOnce free from the yin-yang shell,\nWhat need to debate Mahāyāna or Hīnayāna?\n\nThe five eyes share one essence,\nThe three bodies branch from a single stem.\nWhen the inch of heart is free of self,\nPerfect enlightenment illumines the void.\n\nSelf-arising, self-vanishing,\nNeither shallow nor deep.\nFailing to realize the body is not the self,\nHow can one grasp that things are the mind?\n\nTrampling the realm of emptiness,\nShattering the power of creation.\nFloating clouds gather in stillness,\nThe sun of wisdom lights the zenith of meditation.\n\nWhere does a single word reside?\nTen thousand matters leave no trace.\nCreation opens the celestial cavern,\nThe spirit endures the biting cold.\n\nThough the eye’s faculties serve their use,\nThe mind’s ground rests in clarity.\nFor now, within this dream of life,\nI wander freely with the myriad transformations.\n\nThe body may be narrow as a square foot,\nYet the heart spans the vastness of the void.\nThough seas and mountains divide the four quarters,\nThe three luminaries are seen as one.\n\nIn the land of no-mind, quiescence reigns,\nRadiance gleams through the great void.\nLapis lazuli cradles the jewel moon,\nA net of pearls spans the heavens.\n\nAscending to truth, no turbid qi remains,\nTranscending the world, one bears a pure standard.\nSwiftly I depart the long night,\nObscurely I rise to the highest heavens.\n\nThe jade crucible boils with cinnabar,\nThe golden flask brims with fragrant wine.\nGhosts and spirits cannot fathom the heart,\nHeaven and earth defy the measure of time.\n\nAwakened from the dream of Huaxu,\nThe spirit roams the Purple Palace of Heaven.\nI invite companions from the three isles,\nLeisurely visiting immortals of the ten continents.\n\nThe Dao is attained through non-action,\nDharma arises from the mind’s intent.\nIf one can dissolve the three poisons,\nOne ought to transcend the five phases.\n\nThe Dao manifests through non-doing,\nThe heart arises through dharma.\nHun Yuan embraces all phenomena,\nTai Yi stirs the void to fame.\n\nMovement arises from stillness,\nNon-doing is itself doing.\nWhere the three lights do not shine,\nThe ten thousand forms reveal their clarity.\n\nOriginally attained without the heart’s effort,\nWhy labor with intent?\nWhere the five phases do not reach,\nThe myriad transformations all return.\n\nThe moon ascends, bright at mid-heaven,\nThe wind arrives, pure in the midnight hour.\nIn grotto-heavens, mortals never tread,\nYet the idle wanderer finds welcome.\n\nThe herb gardens and mushroom fields are pristine,\nThe golden altar and jade halls renewed.\nWithin the gourd, night never falls,\nBeyond the world, spring is eternal.\n\nThe ten caves array the lofty perfected,\nThe three heavens house the exalted sages.\nWhite clouds escort the traveler,\nThe azure bird conveys their letters.\n\n---\n\n**Ten Hymns in Praise of the Dao**\n\nThe Great Dao is without limit,\nLong life knows no shore.\nWhen kalpas end, the provisional returns to reality,\nThe turning of time blooms anew.\n\nVirtue and the Dao bear no form,\nNo painting can capture their truth.\nSages and worthies silently aid the world,\nThrough past and present, they commune with the divine.\n\nThe Dao unfolds the three principles,\nHeaven and earth display the ten thousand forms.\nMountains and rivers coil around the earth’s axis,\nSun and moon course through the celestial wheel.\n\nIn the indistinct, spirit is the trunk,\nIn the misty, qi is the sprout.\nHeaven and earth are like long leaves,\nSun and moon resemble blossoms unfurled.\n\nThe Dao governs the flourishing of yin and yang,\nHeaven perfects the work of creation.\nGhosts and spirits’ essence remains unseen,\nYet the qi of mountains and seas flows in secret.\n\nThe Dao governs the flourishing of yin and yang,\nHeaven bestows the essence of rain and dew.\nThe three lights shine together,\nThe myriad transformations all take form.\n\nThe Dao governs the flourishing of yin and yang,\nHumans receive the grace of rain and dew.\nThrough darkness and light, they follow sun and moon,\nCreation emerges from heaven and earth.\n\nGreat simplicity embraces primordial qi,\nFrom no direction, it receives the divine.\nThe divine penetrates creation,\nPrimordial qi weaves the warp and weft.\n\nGreat sages open heaven and earth,\nAcross the vast expanse, they array sun and stars.\nRevolving, they divide day and night,\nThrough past and present, they illumine living beings.\n\nSun and moon radiate their brilliance,\nWind and thunder shake the depths.\nIn boundless harmony, no action is taken,\nYet transformation holds the numinous.\n\n*End of Scroll Four of the Panxi Collection*\n*Scroll Five of the Panxi Collection*\n\n**Qiu Chuji of Eternal Spring at Mount Qixia: Lyrics Without Worldly Thoughts**\n\n**#1 Dwelling at Panxi**\nAlone I tread the steep path, drifting down the Qin River,\nWestward into Panxi’s countryside.\nBefore the vast valley’s cliffs, beside the secluded stream,\nI carve a cloud-high niche to rest my trace.\nNo smoke nor fire, no basket nor gourd laid by,\nWhat daily needs have I to store?\nHungry, I eat; thirsty, I drink,\nSeeking sustenance through village lanes as time allows.\nCold or hot, scraps or leftovers,\nFill my gut, no need for rare delicacies.\nWeak or strong, I make do to pass the day,\nSpared the toil of kitchen labor.\nThe skin-bag is clad, its pores steamed,\nTo moisten and replenish its fluids.\nThe colored body light and hale,\nThe Dharma-body easily nurtured.\n\n**#2 Upholding Resolve in the Cold of Winter**\nAmidst auspicious clouds and auspicious snow,\nIn the depths of winter’s frozen, sealed season,\nA mountain hut stands silent and solitary,\nAll day without a soul to speak to.\nTattered sleeves worn again, alone in the cold cave,\nThe long night’s sorrow hard to endure.\nThrough endless watches, no sleep comes,\nThe north wind howls through the door, piercing and bleak.\nMorning, I seek rice in the western village,\nBy the spring-lined path, jade-like leaves and frost-flowers form.\nIn Shaanxi grows a kind of grass, two feet tall, nameless.\nIn autumn and winter, its upper stem dies, the lower lives on.\nAt dawn’s chill, between the half-stems, ice forms two ridges,\nLike the fletching of an arrow.\nFrostbitten hands warmed by breath, yet still I resent\nThis impure frame, this mediocre mortal flesh.\nDay and night, hunger and cold press in,\nWhen will I transcend birth and death?\nI must rely on steadfast will,\nTo shatter the moon of the ancient heart.\n\n**#3 The Chessboard**\nThe road ahead is long, its splendor yet unseen—\nGolden, jade-like, the immortal’s spirit and form.\nIn solitude, with no merit, heaven bestows upon me\nA chessboard to brighten my face and while away the days.\nBefore the Ancient Minister’s Cliff, upon the Clear Wind Terrace,\nI linger till the morning meal is done.\nA recluse comes to visit,\nOur refined hearts delight in the game’s subtle strategies.\nAt first, like riverside or seashore,\nIn threes and fives, scattered cranes and crows emerge.\nBreaking ranks, charging passes, forming arrays,\nTangled like coiling dragons and serpents.\nBrilliant calculations, clever schemes,\nDiagonal leaps and straight advances—\nTen thousand changes all return to one.\nIn boundless divine function,\nNo need for arts beyond the world.\n\n**#4 In Praise of the Master**\nVast and boundless, the bitter sea,\nLike the eastern deep—profound, wide, bottomless.\nEndless sentient beings, topsy-turvy in competition,\nLike fish at play, vying in the waves.\nTossed by towering swells, submerged in surging waves,\nTheir cravings like drunken madness.\nAdrift without end,\nHow few become soaring Peng to transcend!\nOnly that day’s Chongyang,\nClear-eyed and awakened, alone held lofty aspirations.\nStudying the *Yi* in advanced years, his heart fully enlightened,\nHe snapped the reins of fleeting vanity.\nAfter ten years, the elixir perfected,\nIn an instant, his work complete—\nShedding his shell like a cicada’s molt.\nSince parting from the Master,\nWho else has carried on his noble example?\n\n**#5 The Straw Cape**\nBy the ancient banks of the deep stream,\nWhen autumn comes, the sedge grows thick and lush without end.\nSelecting the long and short, I return to the grotto,\nWhere the empty sky’s sunlight dries them.\nTwo bundles of silk dried, a thousand strands bound,\nNo need for skilled craftsmen’s discernment.\nIn my leisurely pavilion, I myself\nKnit the fisherman’s garb.\nAt times, I roam with woodcutters and herders,\nThrough green mountains and emerald waters,\nWith rain and mist as my companions.\nExquisite beyond compare, to treasure in the twilight of secluded paths,\nDonning it to push through reeds and rushes in the snow.\nI have forgotten my name,\nOthers all call me by another—\nThe Straw Cape Guest.\nPanxi calls me the Straw Cape Master.\nWhen my work is complete in years to come,\nI shall transform into clouds, vanishing without trace in the heavens.\n\n**#6 The Bamboo**\nHollow-hearted, emerald bamboo,\nEndowed by nature with a singular purity.\nBeneath the moon, before the wind, fit for admiration,\nIts banter free of worldly俗.\nTender leaves rustling,\nEven in deep winter, they stand out amidst a thousand woods.\nIts noble bearing, lustrous and smooth,\nLike the cold jade of the Mystic Garden.\nThe good-hearted Lord Tian of Eastern Li—\nThe abbot of the eastern neighbor’s hermitage—\nNewly planted them by South Stream,\nOpening my eyes to verdant hues.\nAll day I gaze beyond the window, chanting high,\nAs the wind stirs the green tips of the bamboo.\nGently wafting, its subtle fragrance,\nSparse shadows swaying, soothing body and flesh.\nA tranquil companion in the cloud niche,\nIts refined spirit befits an immortal’s blessing.\n\n**#7 The Moon**\nNestled by cliffs and ridges,\nThe long night’s stillness deepens—\nDesolate, the demon of dusk is not alone.\nThe bright moon, clear and luminous, appears over the mountain,\nIts radiance at the edge of heaven just emerging.\nDew congeals, frost forms,\nGolden splendor, jade-like luster,\nHow ethereal and free!\nIts purity descends upon the world,\nRevealing the divine beauty of its form.\nMournful, the six directions’ multitudes,\nSunken in darkness, grieving in toil and sickness.\nThe great Dharma’s good causes widely spread salvation,\nAll attain carefree tranquility.\nVast qi surges,\nIts lingering light suffuses—\nHow could this true nature ever falter?\nThe perfect brightness of the Dharma-realm,\nThe Dharma-wheel ever self-sustaining.\n\n**#8 Late Autumn**\nFrost-laden winds sweep and stir,\nDancing, scattering leaves slant across the paths.\nGazing to the farthest reaches of the long fields,\nWithered chrysanthemums, mottled, still bloom.\nSpecks of gray-green moss,\nEndless morning dew,\nGradually congealing into white frost.\nMountains high and low,\nAll become a single hue of autumn.\nUnfettered, all things wither and decay,\nThe weather desolate and bleak,\nSaddening the traveler on the road.\nThe roots of clouds in valleys offer no delight,\nOnly the verdant pines and cypresses remain.\nThose who awaken to the Dao, true immortals,\nThose who forget worldly schemes, recluses—\nFrom ancient times, they share this standard.\nDefying the cold, surpassing the multitude,\nEver since heaven and earth began, they have been thus endowed.\n\n**#9 Confused Longing**\nThe four seas and myriad mountains,\nAt dusk, the sky clears—\nDispelling lurking yin demons.\nBefore the Taiyi Cliff, the wind’s path swift,\nA thousand-foot wave churns the toad’s legs.\nFurious snow, startling waves,\nCrashing against the dike, pounding the shore,\nThunder rolls, clouds tumble in pursuit.\nGreen gulls and white egrets,\nFly swiftly over the moonlit river.\nHigh and low, a thousand flocks, ten thousand groups,\nCalling, summoning, gathering at the bend of the clear river.\nThe moon’s jewel, the divine pearl, now entice,\nRolling forth, all restraint forgotten.\nLeaping, floating, exquisitely radiant,\nTheir worth suddenly like jade worth a thousand cities.\nIn boundless brilliance,\nThey overturn heaven and earth.\n\n**#10 Immortal Scenery**\nThe Ten Continents and Three Isles,\nBearing eternal spring—boundless the light of endless night.\nJade pavilions and crystal towers rise upon the peaks,\nTowering, majestic, a thousand feet high.\nGreen cypress and towering pines,\nCrimson clouds and dense mists,\nCluster round the immortals’ abode.\nVast the sea of clouds,\nYet where is the water to be found?\n\nFrom afar, recalling Xu Fu of old,\nHis towering ships sailing east—\nGone without a trace.\nTen thousand miles of azure waves stretch empty and vast,\nFar as the autumn sky’s edge.\nGrieving for mortal life,\nHow escape the transformations of things?\nHow wander the immortal realms?\nTo transcend the mundane, to enter sagehood,\nLies in the ease of the body beyond the body.\n\n---\n\n**#11 Delighting in the Dao**\nWelcoming the present, sending off the past,\nSighing for spring blossoms and autumn moons,\nYear after year, as promised.\nThings shift, stars drift, human affairs change—\nHow many rise and fall, sink into oblivion?\nHouseholds fed by a thousand soldiers,\nOfficials ennobled to the first rank,\nYet even these find no refuge.\nTime flashes like lightning,\nA hundred years stolen away in an instant.\n\nFortunate to awaken within the Mystery Gate,\nTo rend the web of doubt,\nTo crash through to true joy.\nEnveloped in auspicious radiance within the white jade pot,\nA single grain of divine elixir gleams bright.\nBeneath the moon, before the wind,\nEnduring as heaven and earth,\nFreely riding the phoenix and crane.\nThe illusory dream of the world—\nUnbearable to revisit once more.\n\n---\n\n**#12 Nature’s Permeation**\nThe Dharma Wheel first turns,\nWisdom’s wind arises—\nSuddenly, boundless cool clarity.\nBright hues congeal in the void, auspicious qi gathers,\nDispelling the dust’s vexations from breast and mind.\nThe Five Thieves flee,\nThe Three Corpses vanish,\nNo trace within or without.\nThe spirit rests in peace,\nProfoundly still, unmoved by spear or halberd.\n\nStrolling the purple paths of the red dust,\nHungry, one eats; thirsty, one drinks,\nPassing days as fate allows.\nBeyond things, in leisure, lies heaven and earth’s treasure,\nFrom time to time, the chime of jade rings.\nA later pact to seek a master,\nA future path to return home—\nTrue tidings come of themselves.\nThe crane’s summons arrives,\nSeated, one ascends the Milky Way to wander.\n\n---\n\n**Three *Shen Yuan Chun* Poems to Instruct the Assembly**\n\n**I**\nWorldly affairs surge like water rushing east—\nWhen will they ever end?\nSighing for fame and profit through the ages,\nVying like tigers and leopards,\nWhile hills and plains, in a single day,\nAll keep company with foxes and jackals.\nAmid thorns and brambles,\nWithin the shade of mulberry and elm,\nWho among the piled-up graves knows who is who?\nDo you know?\nIn vain, a hundred years of toil,\nOnly to furrow one’s brows in vain.\n\nHow much better to return home!\nRelease the Four Great Elements,\nRoaming freely, doing nothing.\nBy ancient cliffs and caves,\nPreserve life’s essence;\nFacing the wind, beneath the moon,\nLaugh and wander in carefree ease.\nA song of mystery,\nA thousand goblets of fine wine,\nAs the sun and moon cycle on—never aging!\nA youthful face remains,\nEver granting the tortoise’s longevity, the crane’s years,\nNo need to sing of the yellow cock’s lament.\n\n**II**\nFeasting from tripods in grand splendor,\nHare flees, crow flies—\nIn a turn of the head, all fades to silence.\nLike lightning splitting the night,\nA sudden flash amid the clouds;\nMorning frost greeting the sun,\nHardly enduring upon the grass.\nProud steeds and literary fame,\nInscribed bridges and renown—\nAll fleeting, like tales from a dream.\nHow much better I,\nEmulating the carefree, calming thoughts,\nReturning to simplicity, restoring the original.\n\nPitiable the wondrous scenes within the pot—\nA realm apart,\nOf wind, flowers, snow, and moon.\nPlaying with the four seasons as they appear,\nAuspicious clouds and propitious qi,\nThe Three Lights’ radiance enveloping,\nJade grottoes and jeweled feasts.\nOverflowing cups of rosy dawn,\nChanting ancient melodies,\nBones strong, spirit clear—the elixir naturally rounds.\nTruly worthy of love—\nAwaiting the moment of accomplishment,\nTo eternally abide as a flying immortal.\n\n**III**\nWise sons of men,\nSwiftly awaken to the toils of the dusty world,\nDo not weary your nature.\nFor this body and those things—\nAll are but illusions,\nMore empty than real,\nNot to be pursued.\nA thousand entanglements,\nTen thousand sinkings,\nAs time slips by, aging you.\nHow much better to turn\nTo the true teachings of the Great Mystery,\nTo discuss the carefree and formless.\n\nHeaven and earth vast, with no reliance—\nLike a single drifting cloud,\nEmerging from the world, wondrous.\nAwakening to the nature’s union with the Dao,\nThe mountain of karma easily crumbles;\nThe divine boat reaches shore,\nThe bitter sea cannot bewilder.\nWhen deeds are complete and merit fulfilled,\nOne soars as an immortal, transformed by feathers—\nWhat compares to returning to the earth’s depths?\nNothing else matters—\nTo ascend to heaven, to enter the earth,\nAll lies in the mind’s doing.\n\n---\n\n**#2 Mind’s Permeation**\nGreat wisdom, leisurely and free,\nUnfettered, following nature’s course.\nEntrusting refined feelings and hidden joys,\nAmong pines and upon rocks,\nSinging loudly, deeply drunk,\nBeneath the moon, before the wind.\nJade maidens play the sheng,\nGolden youths dance with sleeves,\nEscorting me, tipsy, into the Great Mystery.\nWithin the Mystery’s principle,\nAll floating and sinking, vast and boundless,\nComing and going, ceaselessly.\n\nWondrous! The ineffable marvelous scene—\nCount it as another\nHeavenly grotto in the human world.\nProudly standing, body steadfast,\nMountains wear away the years;\nLet the frivolous change,\nSeas turn to mulberry fields.\nSpirit and qi harmoniously surge,\nYin and yang rise and fall—\nAlready claiming the carefree life of an earthbound immortal.\nWithout affliction,\nFreely open the heart, wield the brush,\nWildly inscribing poems.\n\n---\n\n**#3 On the Ninth Day, Offering the Morning True Rite at Guoxian**\nResplendent Double Ninth,\nAuspicious qi drifting, drifting,\nEncompassing the vast thousand worlds.\nJust as the old hermitage gathers,\nGuests and friends in throngs,\nThe azure sky faintly visible,\nWild geese gracefully gliding.\nEverywhere, climbing heights,\nHolding cups, carefree delight,\nUnfettered as earthbound immortals.\nAt the Morning True Assembly,\nPraising the golden wind’s gentle sway,\nThe jade dew’s freshness.\n\nTender yellow blossoms, lovely buds,\nWafting delicate fragrance,\nFilling the seats.\nEnabling all to taste and savor,\nEach awakening to the supreme Dao,\nWhile the flock of orioles falls silent—\nOnly the autumn king’s voice rings through the sky.\nLush apricots, bewitching peaches,\nSpring’s riotous splendor—\nNone dare contend with frost’s steadfastness.\nSeizing the joyous moment,\nFacing the radiant clusters, drinking to intoxication,\nA single drunkenness lasting three years.\n\n---\n\n**Water Dragon Chant: Western Hao**\nPhoenix cries in the southern village, pure and fine,\nA great immortal descends, riding the phoenix’s land.\nJewel palaces and precious pavilions,\nStar altars and moon halls,\nScholars’ groves and verdant bamboo.\nIncense canopies and cloud banners,\nShadows swaying in the cold halls,\nComing and going, manifesting auspiciousness.\nGazing east from the empty pavilion,\nThe plain spreads like brocade,\nThe mighty river flows,\nVast as the horizon.\n\nMountains fair, waters sweet, people righteous—\nEvery ward and village\nBrimming with harmonious qi.\nI come, unable to bear\nLightly departing from Liu and Jiang,\nHeaven’s heart and earth’s lungs.\n\n**Waiting for the Time**\nWe must await the hour when hidden dregs are sifted,\nNurturing the cinnamon of elixir’s truth.\nOn Chang’an’s road, they sleep on ice and lie beneath the sun,\nBecoming lifelong marvels.\n\n**II. Admonition to the World**\nCounting the haste of this floating life,\nAll vie in craving and idle vexation.\nSix dynasties, five hegemons,\nThree kingdoms split seven ways—\nEastward campaigns, westward wars.\nWhere now are those martial schemes?\nOnly desolation,\nWildflowers and fragrant grasses.\nMourn the deep designs, the far-reaching plans,\nThe heroic hearts and towering qi—\nAll dimmed to ash, all withered to dust.\n\nI have traversed Chang’an’s ancient roads,\nAsking the hundred-year-old elders of the ruins.\nTang courts and Han markets,\nQin palaces and Zhou gardens—\nAll plainly declare their tale.\nFormer sites linger, yet\nFormer men have scattered,\nNo word left to send.\nConsider the ephemeral—\nBorn at dawn, dead by dusk—\nWho can secure heaven’s permanence, earth’s endurance?\n\n**III. Clear Night**\nThe night clears, vast and chill at first,\nThe pale sky gleams like flawless beryl.\nBeneath the unshaded trees,\nAtop Chang’an’s towers,\nThe moon shines bright, the wind is fine.\nA hundred ills dissolve in silence,\nTen thousand households share the same pure savor.\nSee Venus gleam,\nThe Silver River gleam,\nTheir radiance intertwined,\nFilling heaven and earth.\n\nThe azure void flows like water,\nUnobstructed in its boundless course.\nIt surges against mountains, crashes upon seas,\nPouring forth light, teeming with splendor,\nEndlessly emitting auspiciousness.\nFrom this moment on, understanding dawns—\nThe treasure vase stands firm,\nThe jade nectar flows freely.\nTo whom shall I pour out my heart’s longing?\nWho will comprehend?\nLet us drink deep and grow blissfully drunk.\n\n**IV. Spring Inspirations (Two Poems)**\n\n**I**\nThe Wu sky stretches wide, newly clear,\nQi revives, and all things flourish in joy.\nPavilions rise and fall,\nMountains soar and valleys dip,\nWoven into brocade’s richness.\nEmerald grottoes, limpid springs—\nTheir echoes ring afar,\nA single, ceaseless stream.\nEver and again, I lift my gaze,\nGazing into the distance,\nWhere blue peaks touch\nThe white clouds’ melody.\n\nCountless numinous birds and wondrous beasts\nConsole my idle heart,\nUnmoved by woodcutter’s lean frame.\nWind-whispering verdant pines,\nTwin cliffs vie in height,\nA thousand trees compete in splendor.\nSunlit cinnabar terraces,\nFour seasons for companions,\nA hundred years of life’s span.\nLet cold come, let heat depart,\nLet stars shift and things transform—\nI sleep high through the day.\n\n**II**\nGrotto-heavens brim with spring’s hues,\nJumbled peaks embroider a thousand heaps of brocade.\nClouds withdraw, rain ceases,\nDawn clears, mist thins,\nThe azure sky lies pillowed across the land.\nI recline in bliss,\nMy cares unfurled,\nDelusions dissolved, sleep forgotten.\nBehold the immortal blossoms, auspicious herbs—\nFacing the wind, bathed in sunlight,\nThey glow with radiance,\nTranscending the mundane.\n\nA time of joy and abundant harvest,\nAll nations at peace,\nEvery evil restrained.\nWithin this realm of Great Peace,\nOn Chang’an’s streets,\nWhat hinders free passage?\nThe Great Dao is without doubt,\nSide paths and crooked trails\nNeed no scrutiny.\nFor since the primal kalpas,\nEven immortals passing by\nHave known such scenes.\n\n**V. The Dao’s Course**\nAt the Primordial’s first unfolding on Southern Marchmount,\nAuspicious clouds pierced Kunlun’s outer bounds.\nStars shifted, lightning turned,\nYin ascended, Yang descended,\nCrimson light drifted in the distance.\nCranes danced, phoenixes soared,\nWatching the black tortoise and\nThe crimson serpent coil afar.\nAll within the primordial qi,\nRefined into creation—\nThe Dao of immortals\nCompleted in an instant.\n\nClouds disperse across the Ten Isles and Three Mountains,\nWithin the grotto-heavens, deep—\nMoon bright, wind gentle.\nNow I claim\nThe gate of longevity,\nA body tuned to distant years.\nLet others chant as they will,\nThough seas shift and mountains change,\nThough stones wither and pines age.\nI alone wander amidst mist and rosy clouds,\nBeyond the realm of *fei-fei*—\nOnly lamenting that few know my tune.\n\n**Lyrics to \"Court Filled with Fragrance\"**\n\n**I. Expressing My Heart**\nAdrift in form, unmoored in spirit,\nMy madcap traces resemble an untethered boat.\nCarefree all day,\nWell-fed, I roam at will.\nLet them offer high office and heavy emoluments,\nGolden fish pendants,\nFat horses and light furs—\nWhat do I know?\nZhuang Zhou dreamed of butterflies,\nButterflies dreamed of Zhuang Zhou.\n\nEnough.\nI understand:\nGreed for wealth, lust for beauty,\nSickness and sorrow abound.\nBetter a hempen robe and straw sandals,\nPassing the seasons in leisure.\nAs I wander village lanes,\nChildren all call out,\nOffering rice to detain me.\nI know well—\nThe dream of Southern Branch is over,\nMy heart seeks nothing more.\n\n**II. Admonition to the World**\nA hundred-foot tower, perilous,\nA thousand grand halls,\nWith wanton songs and effortless comings and goings.\nThis illusory body—how wretched!\nNo different from a candle in the wind.\nOnce, they flaunted boundless wealth,\nDazzling as the age’s brightest heroes.\nA hundred years hence,\nWhere will all this lead?\nIn a single day, all turns to emptiness.\n\nGentlemen,\nAwaken early!\nWithdraw, retreat,\nLeap free from the cage.\nRecall the original, single spark—\nLost in endless wandering.\nFortunate to meet an age of peace and plenty,\nSteal moments of leisure,\nLet understanding grow round.\nWhere thoughts dissolve,\nLuminous waves settle,\nAlone I guard the crystal palace.\n\n**III**\nIn my youth, I left home,\nPoor and alone, delighting in the Dao,\nMy heart drifting beyond the world like tumbleweed.\nThe graves in my homeland,\nNeglected through the seasons,\nNo rites performed.\nFortunate that the village’s worthy men joined forces,\nDug new tombs,\nErected pagodas in layers.\nThe remains were gathered,\nMoved together,\nReinterred in the great burial ground.\n\nPeople from beyond the pass\nAll speak of their great virtue,\nEach repaying my humble self.\nHearing their words,\nMy heart brims with boundless gratitude.\nI regret I have no way to repay their kindness,\nOnly redoubling my resolve,\nDeepening my devotion to the mysterious work.\nWith profound reverence,\nI dedicate this to my Daoist companions,\nEach may suffer fewer calamities.\n\n**IV. The Ninth Day**\nWild geese call from the frontier,\nGardens change their hues—\nLate autumn bears a different scene.\nSilken waves stretch across the land,\nBrocade trees mirror the endless sky.\nAfter rain, clouds and mountains stand bold,\nFrost-kissed, golden chrysanthemums bloom in splendor.\nOn this fine day,\nA thousand gates, ten thousand households\nCelebrate Double Ninth with joy and laughter.\n\nAuspiciousness—\nWho is blessed to meet\nThe four friends of my gate,\nFirst to taste the purest flavors?\nThey drink deeply of clear dew,\nOften pouring rosy nectar.\nWhen the draught of ghee anoints their crowns,\nThey return home—\nThe moon fills the empty hall.\n\nFree from care, blissfully joyous,\nDrunk and deep in the immortal realm.\nDivine radiance gleams from three heads—\n*Shengsheng Man* #5\n\nJoy and sorrow cast aside,\nSight and sound forgotten,\nFrom the first, called \"Seeking Stillness.\"\nIgnorant of the root,\nThey stubbornly debate right and wrong.\nPlucking flowers, picking leaves in vain,\nExhausting schemes to no avail.\nSuch matters—\nAll may grasp them easily,\nYet none can truly follow.\n\nNot in verbal sparring,\nNor in vying before others,\nWith pretentious learning and vast knowledge.\nThe noble one contends not,\nOnly seeks to return to simplicity and dispel doubt.\nIn darkness, release the four great elements,\nLet worldly toils scatter in an instant.\nOnce recognized,\nThe wise will clap their hands and laughingly return.\n\nFurthermore—\nProbing the Three Teachings,\nGuiding all beings,\nAll are led to align with Heaven.\nAspiring to the Dao, cultivating truth,\nIn movement, stillness, sitting, lying—all is devotion.\nFirst, preserve the body’s purity,\nWithin, ever hold compassion for all beings.\nSubdue sharpness,\nThis is the initial act and foundation of the beginner’s mind.\n\nGently refining temperament,\nCutting away residual desires,\nEver pruning folly and delusion.\nWith blessings and wisdom both complete, enlightenment dawns,\nNaturally entering stillness.\nWithin the sacred chamber, no remorse,\nAmidst all circumstances, no doubt.\nThoroughly awakened,\nAll of empty space severs right and wrong.\n\nMoreover—\nThe gate of truth-cultivation,\nThe great tradition of the Daoist family,\nA boundless realm of eternal spring.\nVital essence brimming,\nIn leisure, another world within a gourd.\nHeaven’s midst, natural joy,\nRevolving the Three Lights day by day.\nNo reliance on cunning,\nOnly pure wind, level and vast,\nThe sagely Dao, even and serene.\n\nA single thought returns to the quiet homeland,\nThe Three Palaces enshrouded,\nPure spirit—ten thousand streams return to the source.\nVast and boundless, divine radiance comes and goes,\nPenetrating the bones, unbroken.\nThe practitioner suddenly sheds all artifice,\nAwaiting the day of accomplishment, ascending as an immortal.\nFor those yet to begin,\nSeek a single word of clarity within these verses.\n\nAscending the cinnabar clouds—\nThe grotto-heavens clear,\nDivine mountains fair,\nFew tread their paths.\nAll cling to the towering dream of the world.\nImmortal winds and auspicious scenes,\nThough suddenly before their eyes, they remain as blind.\nIn the River of Love, all day,\nThey rise and sink, drifting to and fro.\n\nEast they rise, west they set,\nSouth they die, north they live.\nTurning through the four directions,\nTransforming into myriad forms.\nWhen will this fleeting life\nOpen the eye of Dao and quell desire?\nMay their spiritual essence awaken,\nGrasping the flower of emptiness,\nAscending the distant shore.\n\nPart Two\n\n**To Jiaogu Longhu, Military Commissioner of Jingzhao Prefecture**\n\nGrateful for imperial grace, bearing Heaven’s decree,\nHe guards the southwest—\nThe great gates stand open, high against mist and haze.\nTwice entrusted with dual authority,\nBeyond his term, yet none replace him;

serenity.\n\n**Magnolia Blossoms Slow: The Turning Wheel**\n\nI sigh for the numinous source, long lost through the ages,\nboundless in truth, yet at ease.\nSince the primordial simplicity scattered and form arose,\nthe chaos worn thin,\nI have fallen into the prison of wandering.\nLimping and stumbling, turning through the four directions,\nlost in the ford, mired in the bitter sea’s depths.\nThe dharma-realm’s multitudes stir in turmoil,\ndream-spirits drift through a thousand ages of longing.\n\nSunk in the flow—\nbones traded like mountains,\nwho knows when the journey’s end will come?\nBest to forge the true emptiness,\nlet the three luminaries’ wisdom shine,\ngather the clouds of ten thousand kalpas.\nIn the end, one must cast off body and life,\nyet how long will you cling to face and head?\nShatter the single point at the center,\nand at once ascend the divine vessel to the other shore.\n\n**To the Tune of \"Gazing at the Sea Tide\"**\n\nIn Xigu, those who do good abound,\nand responses come again and again.\nI stand in wait, gazing afar,\nwhere clouds surge and qi rises from the northern mountains.\nIn an instant, the interplay of yin and yang shifts,\ntransforming through emptiness and nothingness,\nvast and boundless, filling all.\n\nThe strange peaks take the shape of Mount Taihua,\ntheir layered ridges steep, dyeing the sky with azure.\nSudden rain pours like ink from an overturned basin,\nwhile swift thunder and flashing lightning roar.\n\n**Mighty spirits!**\nThey unleash their divine powers,\nturning the scorching heat of triple summer to solid ice.\nYet alas, where the whirlwind passes,\ngood fields are ravaged,\nand grand houses topple.\nOnly in this land of the Dao do blessings flow,\nwhere sudden lightness follows ceaseless tears.\nI deeply trust that Heaven aids virtue,\nand the fruits of good and evil are clearly divided.\n\n---\n\n**To the Tune of \"Gazing at the Sea Tide\"**\n**On Cultivating the Dao**\n\nThe demeanor of immortals,\nthe gateway to longevity—\nfrom ancient times, virtue and the Dao have been their foundation.\nAll else, if pursued with even a single thought,\nleads to madness and folly, all in vain.\nThe true teaching dispels delusion,\nhanded down since the days of the Yellow Emperor,\nwho soared on a dragon’s chariot.\nPassed through generations,\nto this day, all return to its embrace.\n\nThe void and nothingness—\na rule shared by a thousand sages.\nFor it crushes cravings and desires,\nrevealing the secrets of heaven.\nGreed and profit are like enemies;\nseeing the body as a dream,\none clings to excess, neglecting appearance.\nReturn to simplicity, embrace the subtle and serene.\nLet your face be unwashed, your hair disheveled,\nclad in paper robes and hempen garments.\nWhen merit is complete, cast all aside,\nand wander the vast expanse,\nstepping upon clouds and rainbows.\n\n---\n\n**To the Tune of \"Breaking Free from the Mundane\"**\n\nA steadfast foundation,\na tranquil gateway—\nthis life is unlike worldly ties.\nIn secluded, vast mountains,\nenlightened beings of the highest order\nmeander, emulating immortals.\nDiligently they labor before the cliffs,\nslowly planting osmanthus and pines,\ntending herb gardens and fields of lingzhi.\nBeneath peaks ten thousand fathoms high,\nthey keep company with tortoises and cranes,\npassing the years in ease.\n\nMy heart has long been set on the remote and strange,\nloving the simplicity of bamboo baskets and gourd ladles,\nmocking the clamor of poetry and prose.\nBy secluded caves and small streams,\nI open my heart to joy,\nsometimes composing short verses, sometimes long.\nRacing horses outpace flowered stationery;\nfreely I wield my brush, chanting wildly,\nmoving through mist and flying smoke.\nUnrestrained, in suchness I abide,\nmingling through the days,\ncarefree and content.\n\n---\n\n**To the Tune of \"Drunken Immortal in Penglai\"**\n**On the Ninth Day of the Ninth Month, the Liu Family of Xigu Holds a Ritual**\n\nSuddenly, the Three Pure Ones’ cranes descend,\nas clouds gather from ten thousand miles,\nand the vast sky clears to emerald.\nJade chimes ring out,\nstirring heaven and earth with their sharp tones.\nAll day, the fast is observed,\nthe empty hall hosts the ritual,\ncelebrating the great immortals’ grace.\nLibations overflow in rosy cups,\nlong songs and wondrous melodies\nlinger in the master’s heart.\n\nThis double ninth day,\nchrysanthemums bloom in profusion—\njust as the Double Yang arrives,\nthe pure autumn air is finest.\nFragrant winds scatter,\nand red osmanthus sways in the crisp breeze.\nSuch rare beauty is seldom met,\nand the highest immortals are hard to encounter—\nfortunate to meet in this moment.\nWild geese cast shadows on the sand,\nmoonlight illuminates the night,\nand all grow mellow with wine.\n\n---\n\n**To the Tune of \"Joy of Heaven\"**\n**Remembering Dharma Kin**\n\nFrom the eastern shores of the sea,\noriginally of three provinces,\nfour of us formed a bond.\nIn foreign lands and distant towns,\nwe walked and sat together,\npassing days in shared play.\nWe spoke of mysteries, discussed wonders,\nexploring the pure emptiness beyond the world,\nthe true flavor of the Daoist path.\nIn leisurely song and response,\nwhat deep meaning bound our dharma kin!\n\nNow, scattered far apart,\neach with苦志 and diligent heart,\nwe refine ourselves, each escaping collapse.\nSince we drifted apart,\nmeetings have been rare,\nseparated by secluded mountains and distant passes.\nDivided by heaven and earth,\nwe gaze like fading stars at dawn.\nWhen shall we meet again,\nriding clouds to pay homage to the Heavenly Emperor?\n\n---\n\n**To the Tune of \"Han Palace Spring\"**\n**On Perseverance**\n\nFor twenty years,\nthe great demon’s host clashed with the true ranks,\na thousand layers of trials to cross.\nWild arrows from mad bows darkened the windows,\nendless in their fall.\nYet through mindful awakening,\nI passed the years,\nunobstructed in the true source.\nWielding the sword of wisdom,\nthe demon horde naturally scattered,\nand I alone displayed mighty power.\n\nMoving in and out of the radiant light of the eight directions,\nmy divine mechanism was unfathomable,\neven heaven’s net could not contain me.\nSweeping clouds, clearing mist, shaking the dharma-realm,\nI left no trace.\nSoaring and transforming,\nI roamed the great void,\nwhere the wind howled in desolation.\nPatrolling the four seas,\nhow many peers shared this journey?\n\n---\n\n**To the Tune of \"The Traveling Merchant Stays\"**\n**On Cultivating the Dao**\n\nMeeting at the four origins,\npassing Mount Hua,\nwe arrived together in the land of Qin.\nSinging and laughing,\nwe subtly revealed the joyous essence of Chongyang.\nThe effortless way naturally transforms people;\nfortunate to be guided by heaven’s will,\nofficial duties and worldly hindrances intervened.\nEastward, by the sea,\nthe three lords’ noble righteousness\nopened wide the gates of the teaching.\n\nThe teaching spreads universally.\nYet I, parted from the group,\nforget my form, too weary to rise.\nLooking inward, I find no fault;\nwhat external calamities could I fear?\nThe three luminaries wax and wane,\nintertwining with myriad changes—\nfavor and harm arise from heaven and earth’s design.\nI will remain for now,\nawaiting the day I achieve my ambition in the azure heavens,\nand walk with ease.\n\n---\n\n**To the Tune of \"Plum Blossom Melody\"**\n**Old Retreat at Pan Creek**\n\nA nameless guest,\nwith no ties or burdens,\nno mulberry or catalpa, no fields or home.\nBefore the ancient cliff,\nbeside the old pine,\nI sing long songs, leaning on my armrest,\nslowly pondering the Great Mystery.\nIn silence, I discuss the deathless—\nin reality, what ever separated self and other?\nThrough a thousand scriptures,\nin harmony with the three spirits,\nI embrace all transformations,\nall returning to a single, profound thought.\n\nNo weariness in walking,\nno fatigue in sitting.\nWhether walking or sitting, I follow my whim.\nThe evening wind is light,\nthe twilight sky clear.\nThe great Dao is carefree,\nthe upper and lower reaches of South Creek level.\nEast of the creek, I fortunately found a friend who forgets form;\nbeneath the moon, we often pour wine to pass the night.\nWhen the wine cup pauses,\nthe moonlight shines pure.\nI loosen my robe, let down my hair,\njoyfully singing of the Dao’s sentiment.\n\n---\n\n**To the Tune of \"Six Orders\"**\n**On Dharma Nature**\n\nWhen the primordial simplicity scattered,\nheaven and earth first took on their hues.\nAs the crow flew and the hare ran,\nthe myriad beings and kinds unfolded.\nA single point of suchness, the true nature,\nplunged into this foul skin-bag.\nThe wandering soul lost the Dao,\ndrifting with the waves,\nfor ten thousand years and a thousand ages, never returning home.\n\nThe body of the primal chaos was broken,\nand love and hate gazed upon each other day by day.\nYet one mistakes the parents’ form\nfor one’s own fine appearance.\nAge after age, trading bones in the wheel of rebirth,\nsuffering endless hardship and calamity.\nWho awakens early,\nseeks the path home,\nand restores the radiant vastness of the old, auspicious state?\n\n---\n\n**To the Tune of \"Fragrant Water Chestnut\"**\n**On Begging for Food**\n\nWhat is the purpose of this?\nWandering idly through the village,\nseeking rice to fill my hunger.\n\n**To the Tune of \"Joyous Oriole\"**\n**On Tempering the Heart**\n\nBlocking the gate, a starving dog,\ncharging and leaping like flight.\nBaring fangs, glaring eyes,\nready to tear at the heart,\nto gnaw the skin of the living.\nTrue, it guards the house,\nyet knows no good from evil,\nno high from low.\nPity this yelping creature—\nthrough many lives, perverse and base,\nits nature sunk in darkness.\nPrecepts expounded, teachings performed,\nyet it snaps at the ear, deaf to all.\nThough the Most High\ndescends in person,\nthere is no place for mercy.\nFor men, best to cultivate early.\nIf you wait until then,\nyour resolve will come too late.\n\n**To the Tune of \"Partridge Sky\"**\n**On Refining the Heart**\n\nLeave behind birth and death.\nTake old habits,\none by one, grind them away.\nThrough a thousand layers of desire,\na hundred temperings of body and mind,\nforge the heart to iron.\nLet the six spirits harmonize,\nthe three corpses cease their stumbling.\nWith fierce resolve,\nrely on this empty space,\nthis passionless discernment.\n\nBreak the bonds.\nOnly then will you meet the perfected one,\nwho transmits the subtle oral formula.\nSuddenly, a divine wind\nblows open the demon’s ranks,\nand your form stands like wood carved, like clay molded.\nOnce you attain the celestial jewel of true nature,\nyou see through spring flowers and autumn moon.\nAt that time,\nghosts cannot summon you—\nonly immortals may lift you up.\n\n**To the Tune of \"Phoenix Perched on Wutong\"**\n**Sent to a Dao-Seeker in the East**\n\nWhere in the world is the fairest scene?\nThe Eight Waters, the Three Rivers—\nsince ancient times, the road to Chang’an.\nBroidered trees, screen-like mountains, winding and distant,\nwho can reach the ends of earth and sea?\n\nSince you’ve left home, do so early.\nSet forth on cloud and water,\ndo not linger for idle flowers and grasses.\nPress on to Tong Pass, to the Western Peak’s temple,\nand your breast will open wide with clarity.\n\n---\n\n**Two Poems**\n**A Dao-Companion Visits Me at Pan Brook**\n\nA rugged cliff, a realm of purity.\nI hew the earth to house myself,\nembracing the Dao, forgetting knowledge and understanding.\nDo not think it strange, my Dao-companion,\nthat I, poor and idle, cling to simplicity with nothing to offer.\n\nWealth and honor, fame and rank—what can they lean upon?\nSo much right, so much wrong,\nso many perils breeding success and failure.\nJade-like feasts and fragrant incense never endure,\nwhile plain gourd and bamboo bowl bring lasting peace.\n\n---\n\n**Reflecting on the Past**\n\nToday I ponder the days gone by.\nI knew my future path,\nyet time stretched long and hard to traverse.\nHeaven gave no great blessing, no aid,\nand suddenly I wished to leave, but had no way to go.\n\nA walking corpse, a moving skeleton—my heart has awakened.\nDreams drift endlessly,\nso for now I dwell at Pan Brook.\nFortunate to have left the mansions of the powerful and bold,\nyet still they come, from time to time, to visit me.\n\n---\n\n**Third Poem**\n**Expressing My Feelings**\n\nThe golden crow wheels west to greet the White Emperor.\nI gaze east at the silver toad,\nits bright glow enfolding the green cassia.\nGradually I knock at *Nanhua*, joining the chrysanthemum gathering,\nfilling my cup with the North Sea’s wine until I’m drunk.\n\nDrunk, I lie amid the hues of Zhongnan Mountain.\nThe mountain’s colors are pure and lofty,\nthe night sky unobscured by clouds.\nNot a bird sings, the wind is soft,\nthe moon bright as day, the heavens like water.\n\n---\n\n**To the Tune of \"Double Swallows\"**\n**Spring Mountains**\n\nSpring mist drifts lightly,\ngreen mountains smile,\nfloating clouds scatter across the boundless sky.\nFlowers gleam, stones glisten,\nstrange wonders emerge from grotto-heavens.\nDoors and windows stand high as ten thousand fathoms,\nso that ears and eyes may feast on the wind’s delight.\nThe passions of countless kalpas,\nvast and clear, leave not a speck of dust.\n\nHow lovely—\ncarefree and at ease.\nShedding the shackles,\ncasting off karmic debts and enmities.\nWind as neighbor, moon as companion,\nthe Dao harmonizes with the crystal sounds of heaven.\nEndless towering, sublime scenes\nare all bestowed upon the mountain hall to share.\nThe thousand sages’ priceless pearl—\nwho can name its price?\nAsk: who understands?\n\n---\n\n**To the Tune of \"Ten Thousand Years of Spring\"**\n**Earthen Cavern**\n\nAs autumn comes to the earthen cave,\nwarmth gradually grows, the yang-qi prevailing.\nSecluded dwelling—\nhow the Daoists favor it.\nLaziness, poverty, and illness abound.\nThe bitter cold of winter,\nleaves fallen, mountains and rivers cleansed.\nBefore the window, the contest:\nsnow flies, the wind rages.\n\n**Leisurely Recitations by the Heat**\n\n**II. Patchwork Robe**\nWith autumn’s arrival, the patchwork robe,\nworn close, feels ever more fitting.\nFrost-cleansed sky—\nthe heart roams free, unbound.\nNo fear of the west wind’s might.\nHundreds of scraps, thousands of stitches,\nstitched firm from top to toe.\nLoose yet proper,\noutwardly wild in spirit,\ninwardly radiant as a luminous pearl.\n\n**III. Cuckoo**\nIn spring’s warmth, misty and clear,\nthe cuckoo cries all day in fragrant trees.\nEach call a bitter plea,\nurging one to return home—\nyet where is home to go?\nI long to journey east,\nbut find no path to take.\nYou, sir, raise the question—\nwhat proof do you hold?\nAll is but idle chatter.\n\n**IV. Startled from Sleep**\nDeep autumn night, profound and still,\nthe water clock drips long—sleep heavy with thoughts.\nOne must rely on\nthe Dao’s harmony and ease,\nnot yielding to the demon king’s sway.\nGather the spirit,\ncasting all things from the heart.\nWithin the empty tent,\nthe lamp of wisdom shines bright.\nSeated, I await the golden parrot’s song.\n\n**The Immortal Who Endures Humiliation**\n*For Yuan, the Clerk of Guoxian*\n\nBeyond the world’s workings, heaven’s mysteries remain obscure,\nwhile in the human realm, affairs never surpass this.\nThough you be a hero, your rank the highest—\nyour body is but borrowed,\nwhat more can greed and gluttony compel you to seek?\nI eat when hungry, drink when thirsty,\nmy hempen robe needs no envy of brocade.\nBeyond warmth and fullness, all perversity is restrained.\nIn the empty hall,\nI recline, arm for pillow, legs stretched, sleeping clothed.\n\n**II. Spring Rain (Two Poems)**\n\nFor years, the fields have languished in drought,\nbut this spring, rain and snow fall in abundance.\nA clear omen—more than half the harvest is assured.\nCome the time, we’ll see\na sky-reaching bounty, songs of joy filling the land.\n\nIn February, flowers bloom in patches,\na thousand willows line the embankments.\nAgain, they urge men to play the hero,\ncalling to one another,\nflasks and jugs in hand, they scramble and race.\n\n**Again**\nThe grace of heaven’s rain is met with universal celebration,\nall living things upon the earth know no hunger.\nWorry vanishes from furrowed brows.\nTruly,\nstreets overflow, fields brim with the year’s yield.\nWine is brewed, guests are invited, songs exchanged,\nfeasts are laid, platters piled high.\nDrunk and sated, the heart remains unshaken by foul desires.\nYet pride may overstep—\nbeware, for blessings may yet breed misfortune.\n\n**III. Spring Delights**\nSpring days, spring winds, spring’s beauty fair,\nspring mountains, spring valleys flowing with spring waters.\nSpring grasses, spring blossoms carpet the earth.\nRiding spring’s momentum,\na hundred birds vie in song, contending in spring’s spirit.\n\nThe rains are rich as cream, the fields are fine,\nthe time of Cold Food Festival beckons for play.\nJust right for flowers in bloom—\ndrunk through the night.\nNo cares to bind,\nI let my jade-like form collapse, sleeping clothed.\n\n**IV. Sensual Pleasures**\nArrogance soars to the heavens, feasting from tripods,\nflutes and songs clamor, jade palaces arrayed.\nJade stirrups, flying dragons—robes and caps immaculate.\nGallantry runs wild,\nunaware of the fall into the lapis lazuli well.\n\nSlick as a thousand-fathom mirror, its walls gleam,\nno path in or out where the ways cross.\nThough you possess a clever, nimble nature,\nyour fate cannot escape—\nyou’ll but surrender your scalp’s shadow to him.\n\n**V. Wondrous Use (Two Poems)**\n\nSince ancient times, sages and worthies have followed one path,\nfrom the very beginning, attainment arises from the heart.\nBeyond this lies the land of carefree ease and peace.\nNo other principle—\nnaturally, the workings are serene and fair.\n\nNot in toiling the spirit or tormenting the self,\nbut in letting go of all things, each becomes right.\nWhy choose the willow lanes or flower streets?\nThe body of emptiness\nis originally one thing, without obstruction.\n\n**Again**\nRoaming the world without moving the body,\nilluminating the human realm without using the heart.\nIdly, I kick at the void, playing with it.\nClouds follow—\nlightly gathered and released in all eight directions.\n\nThe rabbit-horn awl pierces to the bone,\nthe tortoise-hair whisk strikes the mountain heavy.\nSweeping away demons and spirits, leaving all empty.\nA pure wind carries me—\nriding the phoenix through the land of Great Peace.\n\n**Immortal of Yellow Crane Cave**\n*For Fellow Daoists*\n\nAll rush about in haste—\nwho will steadfastly hold fast?\nNorth, south, east, west—all are the same,\nbeyond this, there is nothing more.\nWearing out iron shoes in confusion,\nyet enlightenment lies not beyond the hermitage door.\nWhen water flows, the channel forms naturally—\nwhen the practice is complete, merit is fulfilled.\n\n**II. Guoxian, Weinan, and the Luán Region**\n\nThis place’s scenery excels,\nits people all in harmony.\nHidden among water and bamboo, dozens of households,\neach knows the Mandate of Heaven.\nI love the pure and empty landscape,\nstaff in hand, I seek secluded paths.\nEach day, I wander the village once,\nstrolling at ease, reciting poems.\n\n**III. Self-Portrait**\n\nMy homeland lies beyond the horizon,\na nameless scholar upon the sea.\nMeeting the immortal of Zhongnan’s earth,\nhe brought me here to wander.\nI have always loved the drifting tumbleweed,\nthe wild crane’s solitary cloud-like aspirations.\nStraw hat on head, rain cape draped—\nnone know me,\nyet this is the wind-madman.\n\n**Gazing Toward Penglai**\n*For Wang and Qiao, Two Disciples*\n\nWang Qiao’s land—\na melody most pure and fine.\nAncient paths wind and loop through water and stone,\nweeping willows and eaves draped in mist and rosy clouds.\nPeaches and plums interspersed with mulberry and perilla.\nWithin it dwell\ntwo or three who uphold the Dao.\n\n**On Knowing Fate**\n\nTo know fate and endure hardship with indifference,\nto delight in heaven’s simplicity and frugality, never indulging in extravagance—\nthus I preserve the course of my life.\n\n**II. The Qin Plain**\n\nThe Qin Plain is fine,\na tapestry of brocade in bloom.\nAt sunrise after rain, the mountains gleam in beauty;\nunder bright moon and rushing wind, the waters sing their praise.\nA thousand miles stretch boundless, pure and clear.\n\nI have come here,\njoy upon joy, beyond measure.\nHeaven’s blessing in this timely ascent nurtures the Dao;\nthe land’s spirit and its noble people breed no evil.\nFrom time to time, I keep company with mist and clouds.\n\n**III. Bamboo by the Southern Stream**\n\nBamboo by the southern stream,\nsoaring in verdant splendor toward the azure void.\nUpright in stem, hollow in heart—its merit yet unseen;\ndeep-rooted, firmly grounded—the Dao first made manifest.\nHow could frost and snow cause it to wither?\n\nDo not grieve or resent,\nfor great vessels take time to perfect.\nIt bears the solitary, lofty nature of the phoenix’s perch,\nand may yet transform the untrammeled into dragon form—\none day, watch it ascend beyond.\n\n**IV. The Wanderer’s Joy**\n\nA drifting tumbleweed,\nheaven grants me the leisure of water and cloud.\nWhen I wander at ease, time knows no sun or moon;\nwherever I go, my rain cape and hat follow.\nEven wind and rain bring a smile to my face.\n\nThe work of cultivation—\nthe earth’s axis locked with heaven’s gate.\nEmerging from being, entering non-being: a three-foot sword;\neternal life, undying: a single elixir pill.\nMy name inscribed among the ranks of the immortals.\n\n**The Guest by the Green Lotus Pond**\n\n**Entering the Pass**\n\nFeathered transformation, ascending the immortal’s path—\nhow should my brothers proceed?\nEach must diligently cultivate awakening to life.\nTraversing non-being to enter being,\nin stillness, thoughts forgotten,\nsecretly studying the ancestral alchemical classics.\n\nWhen the great calamity’s true visage is revealed,\nmy unbridled heart roams freely in poetic verse.\nOnly when merit and conduct in the world are complete\nshall cloud companions and mist friends,\ninviting the cool breeze and bright moon,\nlaughingly point the way to Penglai and Yingzhou.\n\n**II. Secluded Dwelling**\n\nSince parting eastward from Chang’an’s road,\nI have journeyed west to the temple by Pan Stream.\nGradually, I sought the famed traces of Southern Mountain—\nall faded into silence.\nThe vast gully lies desolate,\nthe earthen shrine refined,\nyet I have never reached the northern abode.\n\nDeep in the night, the path’s travelers grow still;\nalone, I hear the cuckoo’s call before the cliffs.\nThrough the pine branches, its mournful cries persist until dawn,\neach note urging:\n*“Better to return—”*\nYet how can I, with so little cultivation?\n\n**In Gratitude to the Master**\n\n**Mocking the Bearded Monk**\n\n**Mocking the Bearded Monk**\n\nNeither monk nor Daoist, nor gentle in demeanor,\nUnashamed before nine hundred souls.\nAwakened nature transcends the dharma-realm in an instant,\nYet this body, through countless kalpas, remains my prison.\nA changed face and altered guise—none can fathom,\nA walking corpse with wandering bones—no cause for my sorrow.\nExultant, I forget form and return to simplicity,\nLet others mock me as unrefined.\n\n**II. Two Poems from Weinan’s Lu Creek**\n\n**I**\nA rare vista fills the river plain,\nWater and bamboo curve to encircle all sides.\nClustered railings bloom with crimson flowers,\nBefore the gate, verdant cypresses sway gently.\nChildren vie in song as spring winds dance,\nSpirited birds contend in skill at dawn’s tree-tops.\nThirty households dwell within the community,\nTheir devotion to the true Dao outshines Pan Stream.\n\n**II**\nA splendid scene renews itself daily,\nAncient cypresses stand dense in four-season spring.\nThis blessed land, lofty and pure, shuns worldly affairs,\nThe sacred altar often hosts immortal guests.\nEach rejoices in being born within the Middle Kingdom,\nEvery household reverently honors the Perfected.\nIf only all gentlemen would awaken,\nTogether ascending the leakless realm beyond the red dust.\n\n**III. Presented to a Daoist Friend**\n\nImmortals drift ethereal in the Great Void’s secrecy,\nThe worldly have no means to glimpse them.\nFortunate to encounter an open gate of teaching,\nWhen fasting and rites arise, do not refuse.\nBurdened by family, one sins all day long,\nYet cultivating fortune and refining the heart lasts but a moment.\nShould carelessness arise when the time comes,\nHow then to repay such boundless kindness?\n\n**IV. Indolence**\n\nToo lazy to read scriptures, too lazy to burn incense,\nStupefied and reeling as if drunk and mad.\nSun and moon know only rise and fall,\nRight and wrong—why discern short from long?\nGuests arrive, yet my heart is too weary to inquire,\nFood reaches my lips, yet my mouth is too sluggish to open.\nNot that I deliberately indulge this body,\nBut poverty and sickness have left me no cure.\n\n**Golden Lotus Emerges from Jade Flower #8: Encountering the Teachings**\n\n**Master Chongyang**\nLong ago at Gan River, I first met him—\nMaster Chongyang, whose heart opened to the Great Dao.\nHe established teachings and journeyed east to the sea,\nTurning back from the ends of the earth,\nHe brought three or four friends from my homeland.\nWhen Wei Guo ascended, it startled a million households in Qin Chuan.\n\n**II. Self-Description**\n\nUnkempt hair, a face caked in grime,\nI disregard this frame’s poverty and lowliness.\nEmbracing simplicity, I nurture the spirit,\nContent and carefree, delighting in true nature.\nThough ice-pure and jade-fair,\nAll must sink into the earth in the end.\nWhether a Zi Yu or Pan An,\nBeneath the springs, all skulls are the same.\n\n**III. For Li Sheng of Famen Temple**\n\nA lump of foul flesh,\nFor ages deluding people, never enough.\nTen thousand kinds of restless thoughts,\nSix paths of ceaseless rising and sinking.\nThe Buddha-nature innate and true,\nHow can it be obscured and not reawakened?\nThe treasure of the immortals’ lineage,\nOnce enlightened, dispels your delusions.\n\n**IV. Summer Drought**\n\nAt the height of heat,\nUnder a lofty sky, timely rains are absent.\nA thousand miles of clear radiance,\nClouds attempt to form but are scattered by the wind.\nHeaven and earth like a furnace,\nAll day long, scorching heat melts the air.\nCreatures languish, people grow weary,\nRecalling last spring’s complaints of too much rain.\n\n**V. South Village of Western Guo**\n\nA land of excellence,\nWinding waters meander through willow-lined paths.\nEverywhere, ponds and embankments,\nLotus flowers press against powdered walls.\nLofty halls and grand mansions,\nEach household like a painted screen.\nTowering peaks and soaring ridges,\nDay by day, clouds descend with auspicious omens.\n\n**VI. Green Peak**\n\nClouds disperse, rain clears,\nRevealing the Green Peak’s cold, bony majesty.\nWilds still, heavens vast,\nIts towering form pierces the azure vault.\nThe southern stream holds no charm,\nWith you, I while away the scorching days.\nAll day I compose poems,\nNot of idle sorrow, but of you alone.\n\n**VII. To Dan Yang on Provoking Demonic Obstacles**\n\nIn Deng, Lai, Wei, and Mi,\nAcross the four seas, all know of the brush behind the ear.\nLoving to argue, never yielding an inch,\nI now walk the Dao,\nUnlike before, no longer calculating gains.\nLet go of strength and weakness,\nFor now, no brush remains behind my head.\n\n**Awakening from Southern Branch #9: Two Poems**\n\n**I. Offering Chrysanthemums at the Lower Prime Festival for Master Qiao**\n\nWhite dew marks the end of autumn’s third month,\nClear frost arrives in the tenth.\nAll flowers wither in desolate decay,\nOnly the Double Ninth’s splendor stands tall.\nResplendent and lovable,\nIts fragrance must not be wasted.\nEveryone adorns their heads with clusters,\nI ask Master Qiao—\nHave you pinned even a single stem?\n\n**II**\nResplendent golden elixir,\nLight and graceful as a white jade branch.\nThe Double Ninth lingers at the Lower Prime,\nOffering rites to the stellar officials,\nSpecially presented to the true master.\nPetitions ascend to the Three Heavens’ Lord,\nVoices reach the Nine Earths’ overseers.\nLife and death, blessings and fortune, are subtly bestowed,\nThe Great Dao’s vast grace,\nAlso entrusted to those who leave the household.\n\n**II. Presented to Pei Manzi**\n\nA boundless world of dust,\nA fluttering, illusory body.\nThe heart within never understands even a moment,\nYet recklessly it rushes,\nStumbling through rugged paths.\nEnticed, the inner elixir is ruined,\nWorn thin, the inner organs grow hollow.\nSorrow, calamity, and suffering entwine,\nA hundred remedies, a thousand methods—\nNone can cure.\n\n**Refining Cinnabar #10: Presented to Zhou Daoquan of Western Guo**\n\nAbide by your lot, do not force ambition.\nPass the days in leisure,\nContent with heaven’s decree, enduring solitude.\n\n**All Matters**\n\nLet all matters of success or failure rest,\nThe path ahead stretches on, unyielding.\nLoss is but emptiness from the start,\nWhat then is gain?\nA hundred years pass in but a moment’s turn.\nNot so for one whose heart holds fast to the Dao’s thought—\nSage and saint lend their aid.\n\n**Clear Heart Mirror #11: Two Poems**\n*Admonishing the Taking of Life*\n\nAmong the ten thousand spirits, humans are most noble,\nTranscending all, ranked among the Three Powers’ station.\nYet fools indulge in cruelty and folly,\nTaking life as mere play.\nThey never consider the hells,\nLayer upon layer of dark reckoning.\nWhen the great limit arrives at last,\nThey shall answer for their deeds.\n\n*Again*\n\nGhosts and spirits seize them, lash and force them to kneel.\nEyes open in dread, they strain to devise clever schemes.\nYet the Mirror of Karma hangs high above—\nHow can they hide from their foes?\nTongues torn out, hearts carved out to sate vengeance,\nNothing like the old days of fragrant feasts.\nThrough the Three Ways they suffer a hundred torments,\nRebirth as human? Not yet.\n\n**II. Presented to a Certain Strong Elder Among the Offering Assembly, Stricken with Choking Sickness**\n\nWhen setting up the feast for rites, take heed—\nDo not heap dish upon dish in lavish display.\nThe intent was to seek blessings and grace,\nYet you invite misfortune and calamity instead.\nOld Master Strong—do you see now?\nWas it not indulgence,\nExcess upon the body?\nNow, though a hundred delicacies lie before you,\nYour eyes can only watch as you choke on spittle.\n\n**Jade Brazier and Three Streams of Snow #12**\n*Advising Fellow Daoist Yang Against Voyaging to the Sea*\n\nMost bitter are winter’s ice and snow,\nHarder still to bear the winds and dust of ten thousand miles.\nFrom the ends of the earth to the edge of the sea, you never leave the self—\nWhere then can you seek the seal of the heart’s unity?\nMoreover, the inner elixir turns and shifts,\nWhile you vainly chase external scenes.\nHow much better to keep company through the spring,\nWatching my comings and goings near and far.\n\n*II. Diligence*\n\nThough beyond the world the truth is clear,\nHeaven’s heart remains unyielding, its depths unseen.\nTrudging east and west on dusty paths,\nYou but mimic the floating life’s dream.\nDreaming, you toil for years,\nPassing three winters in mountain caves.\nWait for the message of true emptiness to appear—\nThen shall the rainbow bridge rise into the clouds.\n\n*III. Two Poems: Self-Reflection*\n\nAt night, lodging in an ancient temple by Fan Stream,\nAt dawn, climbing a bamboo path through a deserted village.\nAt midday, wandering door to door, hungry,\nBegging a simple meal.\nI do not delve deeply into the workings of creation,\nBut drift with fate through dawn and dusk.\nAll talk of right and wrong, self and other, I abandon—\nReturning to the primal chaos before birth.\n\n*Again*\n\nOne nature shines forth, suddenly revealed,\nThe Two Modes blend in their first fusion.\nLightly I roam the Dharma-realm, east or west,\nEverywhere the divine radiance enfolds me.\nA thousand cold springs cascade over my crown,\nAuspicious mists rise in the eight directions.\nJoyfully I ascend alone to the ninefold heavens,\nWatching the floating life dream on.\n\n*IV. Two Poems: Evening Scenes*\n\nThe bright sun sinks beyond distant ridges,\nA gentle breeze rises from the southern peaks.\nMy carefree spirit soars, my mood refreshed,\nBlowing away sorrow and worldly cares.\nGradually the moon of the heart unfurls,\nIts faint light piercing the spirit’s terrace.\nClear and still, unstained by dust,\nIt gleams beyond the azure heavens.\n\n*Again*\n\nThe sun sets, wind stirs in the ancient cave,\nDeep night, the moon shines on the cold pool.\nThe autumn hues are limpid, mists and vapors pure,\nAlone I play with the round, luminous mirror.\nRecognizing the wondrous essence of the heart’s field,\nI rebuke the world’s greed and craving.\nContent, I lie in the mountain valley beneath pines,\nWilling to wear coarse cloth and eat plain fare.\n\n**Telling of Innermost Feelings: Two Poems Written After the Ninth Day**\n\nScattered frosted leaves swirl in flight,\nThe season has passed the Double Ninth.\nChrysanthemums bloom riotously by the railing,\nStill exhaling their pure fragrance.\nAutumn ages, nights grow long,\nThe Dao’s mood flourishes.\nClouded hermitage, entering samadhi in the Dharma-realm,\nWandering immortals, unmoved by desolation.\n\n*Again*\n\nA lone city, the cold horn’s notes drift,\nWind carries them into the slanting sun.\nThe pond’s lotuses have lost their color,\nBut the orchid’s marsh still holds lingering scent.\nShort are the autumn days, long the evening sky,\nThe moon’s brilliance waxes.\nEmpty and still, vast and bright,\nA heart of pure coolness.\n\n**II. Scenery**\n\nThe scenery of Chang’an is wondrous through the ages,\nYet few know the Way.\nHeaven’s heart and earth’s lungs are in perfect accord,\nLife and death turn on the pivot of the mechanism.\nSpiritual beings flourish, jade mushrooms grow plump,\nRainbows arch across the sky.\nGazing from the mountain’s height,\nThe Three Rivers overawe all beneath heaven.\n\n**Untying Karmic Knots #13: Presented to the Offering Assembly**\n\nThe rivers and mountains are settled,\nWeapons laid down, no war arises.\nIn this time of great peace,\nThe eight directions are harmonious and just.\n\n**Frequent Offerings and Rituals**\n\nFrequent offerings and rituals are held,\nAbundantly repaying heaven and earth’s boundless grace.\nGratitude for the cessation of floods,\nAnd for the compassion and kindness within.\nA once-in-a-millennium encounter,\nWhen immortals descend to the world.\nFortunate to have met this time—\nDo not treat it lightly.\nOfferings are made with utmost reverence,\nEach year surpassing the last.\nOn auspicious days,\nLet all sink into intoxication.\n\n**II. Self-Reflection**\n\nWhen first I sought the Dao,\nI refined myself in emptiness,\nMy resolve soaring to the heavens,\nUnmatched among mortals.\nRoaming free in mountains and forests,\nLater wandering clouds and waters.\nPassing through Yi Gate,\nThen arriving in Qin’s land.\nLike a tumbleweed for a decade,\nJourneying ten thousand miles.\nCrossing passes and fords,\nThrough rugged and distant paths.\nAll affairs now familiar,\nYet once enlightened,\nAll is cast aside.\nSimply following fate,\nClad in coarse robes and straw sandals.\n\n**III. Seeking Sustenance**\n\nOne day in the north, one day in the south,\nEast and west alike—\nFour directions, days intertwined.\nIn dreamlike torpor,\nComing and going,\nPassing time in wandering.\nAwaiting the day\nWhen the heart of the Dao unfolds.\nA century is but a fleeting scene,\nHow many days in all?\nSilently counting,\nToday and tomorrow.\nUnnoticed, the counting leads\nTo the day of sages’ glad tidings.\nWhen the grotto-heavens open—\nThat shall be my day of return.\n\n**Roaming in Alchemy #14: Travels**\n\nClouds and waters drift, chanting beyond the mundane,\nSipping the nectar of stillness in drunken reverie.\nThe immortal’s livelihood—\nThe heart of a Daoist.\nEasily yielding, unwilling to quarrel over trifling breath,\nOrdinary in bearing, hoarding not a single coin of gold.\nIn pure poverty and gentle weakness,\nMisfortune cannot invade.\n\n**II. Sheltering from Heat in an Earthen Chamber**\n\nThe immortal’s abode runs deep, ancient pines verdant,\nCold shadows dense, brushing lightly over moss.\nDesolate yet refreshing all day,\nThe mind at ease.\nThe grotto’s coolness oblivious to the heat beyond its gate,\nThe heart untroubled, the belly alone aware of clarity.\nIn such attainment,\nThe body is as pure as layered ice.\n\n**III. Retreat from the Dao**\n\nSword trees, blade mountains—snow-bright edges cross,\nA thousand torments, a hundred tortures, death yet life reborn.\nA single dawn’s cry, blood streaming—how bitter the climb.\nNeedles pierce the flesh, still the pain lingers,\nSteel blades flay the nature—how could it not ache?\nWhy then, in wanton abandon, forsake cultivation?\n\n**Roaming in the Leakless #15: Delighting in the Dao**\n\nLast year’s grain,\nThis year’s wheat—\nThe land swells like clouds, brimming full.\nYears of plenty, an age of peace,\nThe common folk at ease.\nHearts content, leisure unbound,\nEverywhere carefree, untroubled.\nHungry, they seek shelter;\nWeary, they beg for a meal—\nNo village, no lane turns them away with scorn.\n\n**II. Autumn Clearing**\n\nThe setting sun glows red,\nAutumn waters grow still—\nRain passed, the azure sky like a mirror.\nHedge chrysanthemums bloom,\nBorder geese return,\nThe broad fields’ leaves scatter in flight.\nAscend the western hills,\nSip from the northern sea,\nDrunken, the spirit roams the immortal realms.\nFrost-chilled night, moonlight pure—\nBemused, the intoxication lingers, unshaken.\n\n**III. The Borrowed Body**\n\nA clot of pus,\nA breath of three inches—\nUsed, yet no more than a puppet’s guise.\nBoasting of form,\nStrutting in vanity—\nNone willing to cease.\nSkin of white jade,\nFaces rouged and powdered,\nAll mere adornments of fleeting splendor.\nFlesh rots, blood dries—\nGo, gaze upon the wild wastes.\n\n**Roaming Freely #16: Two Poems for Daoist Friends**\n\nSeeds of good sown in the past,\nThis life’s blessed ground.\nThe Void responds—\nCelestial perfected ones lend their guard.\n\n**Expounding the Dao and Transforming Through Ritual**\n\nAltars opened to propagate transformation,\nGrace bestowed for universal salvation.\nEach month, within its span,\nThree assemblies are convened.\nOn the appointed day, summon one another—\nAt the hour, none may shirk.\nRide the fast, let the heart wander in play.\n\nAt home, lacking sufficiency,\nBrows forever knit in care—\nThus half a fleeting life is spent.\nYet stealing moments of leisure amid the bustle,\nSeek meaning before the master’s gaze,\nFar surpassing blind pursuit of ignorance.\n\nFrom dawn till dusk, clinging to life without cease,\nOne claims, “I’ve lived this life for others.”\nEven if wild ambition and cunning wit\nAre marshaled in manifold schemes to build a household,\nWith heirs to rely on and gold and pearls in endless store,\nStill, in the end, what compares to the spirit’s withering?\n\n**Remembering the Peach Blossom Source: Two Poems in Reply to Dan Yang**\n\nThe Void shines bright as a mirror,\nEvery weak and strong point meets its response.\nChasing after it like shadow follows form—\nThe slightest error, and it corrects you.\n\nOthers’ slander is but empty flattery,\nDistant paths’ wild words lack proof.\nWarn those who come after: do not heed them,\nSilently follow the worthy and sage.\n\n**#17: Two Poems on Deluded Longing**\n\n**I.**\nAlone, I sit by the southern stream,\nOne thing I cannot do—\nA hundred things I do not know.\nWhat I love appears in the misty rain’s wake:\nEast or west,\nClouds part to reveal emerald peaks in ranks.\n\n**II.**\nBones as pale as the Great Void,\nA chill radiance glows, catching the sunlight in flight.\nWhy does the heart never tire of gazing?\nForgetting to return,\nAs if a sickness has seeped into the marrow.\n\n**Again**\n\nAfter parting from an old friend, the idle chant ends,\nIn solitude by Cloud Creek, free and untrammeled.\nBeneath the shadow of a hundred-foot lone pine,\nAlone, I cast the Zhou Tian hexagrams.\n\nPure wind and bright moon, though priceless,\nEven the finest hand and wondrous craft cannot paint them.\nShould I boast of them to the world,\nWho could discern the true from the false?\n\n**III.**\nAmid the tangled grasses, I crouch alone,\nDrumming my belly, I sing at ease in idle leisure.\nA pillow’s wandering immortal dream now broken—\nYet my face remains glad,\nLaughing and roaming where green peaks resound.\n\nAt noon, I unbolt the wicker gate,\nLeaping and lingering to gaze at distant mountains.\nBelow the peaks, someone comes to ask the Dao—\nI know it’s hard.\nLeaping again, wordless, I laugh and turn away.\n\n---\n\n**Penglai Pavilion**\n*Immortal Mountains*\n\nPenglai’s towers—\nVast, vast, the mighty sea, deep and hard to cross.\nDeep and hard to cross—\nRaging waves surge and roar,\nAngry breakers churn like snow.\n\nOn the eastern edge of Jade Empyrean, I’ve heard it said,\nThere lies a realm of emptiness, by nature set apart.\nBy nature set apart—\nThe Mount of the Great Turtle stands unmoved,\nMirage towers endure unbroken.\n\n---\n\n**II. Deluded Thoughts**\n\nA sojourner of rosy clouds,\nI wander west and lodge beside South Stream.\nBeside South Stream—\nA thousand fathoms of crimson cliffs,\nTen thousand trunks of verdant cypress.\n\nMy heart is empty—only pale clouds drift white,\nI lift my head but see no hue of splendor.\nNo hue of splendor—\nVain blossoms scatter in confusion,\nWhile the world clings to greed.\n\n---\n\n**Burning Heart Incense**\n*Two Poems on Cultivating the Dao*\n\n**I.**\nThe Great Dao has no form—\nHow can the square inch of the heart rely on it?\nYet in every person, wisdom and insight shine bright.\nTo subdue the host of desires,\nTo untangle the tangle of passions—\nBe tranquil amid clamor,\nStill amid busyness,\nClear amid turbidity.\n\nLike an infant in disposition,\nLike ice in embrace—\nOnce the cocoon is rent,\nThe former path is seen.\nMy words are utmost counsel,\nListen deeply with your ears.\nExert full effort,\nFull resolve,\nAnd full accomplishment.\n\n**II.**\n\n**II.**\nWhen wild geese turn homeward,\nThe chrysanthemums blaze in the wilds.\nI crouch by deep streams,\nIn ancient caves winding.\nSolitary chanting in stillness,\nAlone refining the returning elixir.\nYet night falls desolate,\nThe cave cramped,\nSitting in hardship.\n\nOne nature scattered,\nYears spent lingering—\nOnly now does the cause and condition reveal itself.\nJade pearls reach the earth,\nThe moon of treasure pierces the heavens.\nThus I emerge, luminous,\nForgetting schemes,\nFree from toil and strife.\n\n---\n\n**Two Self-Chants on Delayed Beginnings**\n\n**I.**\nA drifting idler, born a Qiu,\nDwelling in the east—\nDengzhou on the eastern road.\nFrom youth, I severed the net of worldly ties,\nFollowing my master west in wanderings.\nUnfettered, adrift,\nLike a lone leaf on the long river.\nLet the red dust burn bright as day—\nI drift with the clouds, untroubled.\n\n**II.**\nA carefree body beyond the world,\nLike a wisp of idle cloud in the blue sky.\nLet empty space bring forth auspicious signs—\nI remain unstained by the slightest dust.\nRoaming the eight directions of heaven,\nI meet the three luminaries—\nSun, moon, and stars.\nIn stillness, no worldly affairs arise,\nOnly companionship as my neighbor.\n\n---\n\n**Cloud Brook Reflects the Moon of the Heart: On Qiao’s Loss of His Wife**\nYin and yang shift,\nEternal as the ages.\nGain and loss are but fleeting moments—\nWhy cling to joy in life,\nOr dread in death?\n\n**On Life and Death**\nLife and death, long and short years—\nall within a hundred springs.\nTurn and gaze:\nBehold Mount Bei Mang,\nwhere mounds rise in endless rows,\nall alike.\n\nThe body is but a borrowed dwelling,\nthe nature a transient guest.\nWhere lies the true homeland?\nYet the six paths turn ceaselessly,\ndriven by fate’s whip.\n\nAwakened, lay all down,\nfree from toil and torment.\nNo kin, no need to grieve for others—\nguard only your own steps.\n\n---\n\n**Leaving the Sea of Suffering**\n*For Zhou Daoquan of Xiguo*\n\nI know your heart has long admired the good,\nyet how can one shed the dust of fleeting splendor?\nThough you wish to drift like tumbleweed,\nyour feet remain bound by worldly cords.\n\nSwiftly the sun and moon race overhead—\ntake care not to squander time in vain.\nThe Dao of immortals lies close at hand,\nbut alas, the human heart remains unenlightened.\n\n---\n\n**Spring in Wuling**\n*For Yang Wusheng of Weinan’s Birthday*\n\nThe new year has just begun,\nall things stir to life,\nas the season nears the Lantern Festival.\nAuspicious mist descends from azure skies—\na celestial scion is born.\n\nHis bearing is noble, surpassing all in wit,\nturning to the Dao, weary of worldly clamor.\nThough rocks crumble and pines wither,\nhis years stretch far beyond—\ntortoise and crane alike outlived.\n\n---\n\n**Roaming Clouds and Waters**\n*Self-Reflection*\n\nStay—stay.\nDwell by the emerald cliffs,\nfree from schemes and cares.\nI know my share is meager, my ties light,\nand thus I remain obscure.\n\nA fleeting phantom, I hide my name,\ngrasping at the passing seasons.\nWith the bold folk of Panxi’s shores,\nI weave bonds of wonder and delight.\n\n---\n\n**Far-Reaching Gaze**\n*For the Daoist Friends of Weinan’s Rite During Drought*\n\nFor nine summers, the heavens parch,\nall things wither in the scorching heat.\nThis stems from the human heart,\nwhich breeds needless strife.\n\nFine robes and sleek horses,\nparading in grand processions,\nwhile young and old waste their days\ngathering in every village.\n\nThe petty cannot discern right from wrong,\nyet Heaven judges high and low.\nOur hearts differ—\nwhy do their aspirations drift so aimlessly?\n\nAwaken to sincerity, cultivate the fast,\nchant the good through passing years.\nI hope the Perfected will lift us,\nempty-handed, in their embrace.\n\n---\n\n**Crows Crying at Night**\n*A Warning Against Washing the Face*\n\nAlas, the ways of the world—\npeople indulge their desires without restraint.\nThey speak of human nature,\nspending their days in vanity.\n\nYin and yang reverse,\nheaven and earth rise and fall.\nFortune fades, calamity comes—\nhow can sorrow be endured?\n\nThe year barely passes,\nthe belly’s hunger just sated,\nyet they wash their faces, rinse their veins,\nstill chasing lust and greed.\n\nThose without foresight\nplant deep roots of disaster.\nBefore misfortune sprouts,\nwho understands the need for vigilance?\n\n---\n\n**Congratulations to the Sage at Dawn**\n*A Still Night*\n\nThe setting sun sinks,\nthe ridges swallow the last light,\ncypress and mist lock in cold.\nBy the southern stream, I sit alone,\nlistening to the wind carry\na cascade of murmuring springs.\n\nThrough the long night,\naffairs fade, the spirit at ease,\nI pluck the stringless zither.\nWhen the azure bird descends with omens,\nI shall prove myself a divine immortal\nupon this earth.\n\n---\n\n**No Dreams Command**\n*Against Extravagance*\n*Two Poems*\n\nPeople of the Shaanxi region, heed me:\nin this blessed land, cultivate good karma.\nNowhere under heaven compares—\nrich and poor alike walk the same path.\n\nBeware—beware—\nbeware of excessive pride.\n\nIn the famine years of Huangtong,\nten thousand households knit their brows in sorrow.\nMouths open, yet no food—\ntears fall like scattered pearls.\n\n**Disaster, Disaster**\n\nDisaster, disaster—\nhow to flee when calamity descends?\n*End of Scroll Six of the Panxi Collection*\n\n---\n\n**Annotations from the Jin Dynasty Engraved Edition:**\n1.

Yet Li, with his innate wisdom, uttered words of mystery that startled all, unattainable by worldly talent. Having already prefaced and transmitted this work, how splendid!

      "translated_text": "How may this be verified? Mundane scholars, though they may puff their cheeks and grasp their brushes, do no more than sing of emotions and scour the world for scenes. Those who penetrate principle may illumine the boundary between Heaven and man, aiding the teachings of sages and worthies—even they may vie with the sun and moon in splendor. Yet those who awaken to truth are not thus confined: they utter wordless words, clarify the workings of creation, manifest the formless form, and cast off life and death. With effortless ease, untroubled by cogitation, they shake the void into thunder, and where no text is composed, constellations blaze forth.\n\nThe Elder of Jade Peak now bears witness among the immortals: unattainably high, he is high; unstriven for divinity, he is divine. Is this not because the one qi flows unimpeded, the six apertures stand wide, every gesture is wondrous, and every utterance rings true? Is this not the original state, rather than some borrowed passage? As *The Pan Brook Collection* says:\n*Hand grasping the numinous pearl, ever wielding the brush,*\n*Mind opened to Heaven’s music, no need to blow the flute.*\n\nAgain:\n*Crowned with pine blossoms, eating pine nuts,*\n*By the pine stream, drinking moonlit pine wind.*\n\nAgain:\n*Gathering the triple summer heat from every mountain peak,*\n*Transforming it all into a single ball of ice.*\n\nAgain:\n*Existence and non-existence are self-determined—*\n*What use then for craving and attachment?*\n\nAgain:\n*Wine poured like golden dew,*\n*Tea steeped with jade fungus fragrance.*\n\nAnd in verse:\n*All things laid down, all things are thus—*\n*Why choose between flower-lined streets and willow markets?*\n*The body of emptiness, originally one thing, without obstruction.*\n\nAgain:\n*Roaming the world without moving the body,*\n*Illumining the human realm, the mind rendered useless.*\n\nAgain:\n*Wearing out iron sandals in vain—*\n*Yet enlightenment dawns without leaving the hermitage gate.*\n\nThese few examples suffice; the reader will grasp the breadth.\n\nAlas! The bonds of immortality today must belong to those who in former lives contracted such affinity. Long ago at Eastern Hermitage, I formed a bond with Wang Fengxian the Perfected; in Chang’an, with Ma Danyang. Last autumn, a man from Junzhou came, and I formed a bond with Tan Xian. Only Master Qiu dwells far away on Mount Long. Yet all these—all of them Fengxian’s disciples—have now entered into affinity with me, not by human effort but by destiny.\n\nThough Master Qiu’s Dao was not revealed for my sake alone, its radiance is too vast to be concealed. Thus I, too, have come to share in this bond.\n\nWritten on a day in the fifth month of the bingwu year of the Dading era, by the Elder of Jade Peak, Hu Guangqian of Mount Zhongtiao.\n\nThe orchid grows deep in the forest, yet does not withhold its fragrance for lack of admirers. The crane cries in the distant marsh, and its call naturally reaches beyond. Men of lofty attainment and superior talent may dwell in seclusion, content with withered solitude in mountain fastnesses, or mingle unseen in bustling markets, lost in the dust. Though their abode be near, they seem distant; though their minds be still, their place feels remote. Drifting and floating, like a lone cloud in flight or an untethered boat, they appear and vanish between cinnabar skies and azure seas—where could they go and not be at ease?\n\nWith the Mysterious Origin as teacher and Supreme Harmony as companion, their distant hearts and untrodden paths abide in profound stillness and valley-like emptiness. They emulate the insightful ones who turn inward, follow the diligent practitioners of the highest order, cultivate truth and nurture life, and in leisure moments accumulate merit for others. They also give voice to their feelings in lofty verse and grand compositions, following the purple brush of the august sages to expound the empty songs of the Great Cavern. Their literary works and poetic lines have often appeared in the world.\n\nThus the orchid’s fragrance spreads, the crane’s call resounds. I have sketched this portrait: who, if not Master Qiu of Everlasting Spring, is such a one? A native of Qixia in Dengzhou, he studied alongside Masters Liu, Tan, and Ma under Wang Fengzi of Zhongnan. His name is renowned across the seas, revered near and far, and together with Qiu, Liu, Tan, and Ma, they are known as the Four Masters. Like the immortals and Daoist adepts of the ancient *Dispelling Delusion Treatise*, or the thirty-six methods of nurturing life to attain immortality as taught by the Most High—though dwelling in quiet obscurity among men—their disciples and followers, led by Qi, have come seeking a preface.\n\nThough I have long wished to behold their works, it was only at this riverside frontier that I was granted the honor of glimpsing their magnificent compilation.",

      "translated_text": "Appreciating their serene detachment and carefree ease, they roam unconstrained, even amid the vulgar and mundane. Like playful wanderers beyond the furrowed paths of brush and ink, their words remain uncarved and unpolished—neither cinnabar nor azure—just as the earthen drum and straw mallet seek no resonant performance, or the plain wine and simple broth offer no refined savor. Yet those who know music, who know beauty, shall find it here.\n\nTang’s Jiang Fang praised stillness, while Liao Chong of Fushan said: “The writings of immortals bear no literary art; their speech, no ornate phrases. Heart transmits to heart, unknown even to heaven and earth. They roam free in spirit—who in past or present could claim to rival them?” Master Qiu of Everlasting Spring echoed this.\n\nOn the winter solstice of the *dingwei* year of the Dading era, Mao Hui, Gentleman for Literary Composition, former Erudite of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices and Collator of Texts, Cloud-Banner Cavalier in retirement from Pingyang, composed this preface.\n\nThe subtleties of the Supreme Dao cannot be sought through sound or color, nor glimpsed through form or trace. They must rely on perfected beings to devise means of transmission—composing verses and selecting lines—so that others may recite and chant them, gradually entering the sacred realm and approaching the Mystery’s gate. Yet if phrases lack incisiveness and prose lacks depth, how can they captivate their age or inspire later learners?\n\nNow, beholding Master Qiu of Everlasting Spring’s *Collected Works of Pan Creek*, I find that even a single word or phrase suffices to rouse the deaf and blind, to cleanse the dust of clamor. Was he not born with keen insight, dedicating himself to the Dao before reaching twenty? For over forty years, he has remained sleepless, recording three thousand words daily, traversing ten thousand *li* of land, storing the Three Teachings and nine schools within his breast, their radiance illuminating his spirit. Small wonder his fame resounds at the vermilion palace, where imperial edicts beckon, and his affinity with true immortals delights in the golden carp’s attainment.\n\nThus, among the thousands who followed Chongyang’s path, only Qiu, Liu, Tan, and Ma stood out as exceptional. Yet even among them, his lofty renown alone draws universal acclaim.\n\nRecently, an old friend, Gong Hengdao of Longxi, journeyed from Donglai straight to the prefectural office of Fengcheng, earnestly entreating a preface for the collection. He bowed repeatedly, pressing his request again and again. Though I know my hands, calloused by sword and ledger, are ill-suited to capture even a faint likeness, I have long admired his reputation and regretted never having met him. Now, with the arrival of this season’s guest, the measuring line cannot be drawn back. With no way to decline, I reluctantly inscribe these few words.\n\nOn the second day after the Double Fifth Festival of the *bingyin* year of the Taihe era, Yila Lin, Grand General of Zhaoyi, Military Commissioner of Wuding Army, concurrently Surveillance Commissioner of Fengsheng Prefecture, Director of Ever-Normal Granaries, Defender-in-Chief, Marquis of Qishui Commandery with a fief of one thousand households and an actual enfeoffment of one hundred households, inscribed this.\n\nFormerly, Master Zhuang composed thirty-three chapters, most of which employed parables and analogies.

      "translated_text": "Regarding the guidance of common folk and the transformation of the obstinate—dispelling their delusions—even the most reticent cannot avoid resorting to speech. The eminent scholar of the Eastern Lands, Master Qiu the Perennial Spring, was born in Qixia of Dengzhou. A year before coming of age, he wandered to Mount Kunyu, where he encountered Wang Haifeng, the Master of Double Yang. With a single word, their Dao resonated, and he became his disciple. Wang bestowed upon him a poem, which read:\n\n*\"Gently I reel in the silk line,\nDrawing you into Penglai, forever free.\"*\n\nFrom this, one may discern how deeply he had penetrated the caverns of principle. After some time, he accompanied his fellow aspirants—Masters Ma, Tan, and Liu—in following the Master of Double Yang to Nanjing. Those who knew them called Qiu, Liu, Tan, and Ma the Four Friends of the Forest’s Edge. Before long, the Master of Double Yang relinquished his abode. The four escorted his coffin back to Zhongnan for burial, dwelling in a hut beside his grave. When the mourning period ended, each discussed where to go next. Only Master Qiu delighted in the customs of Qin and Long, residing six years at the Temple of Pan Stream and seven years on Mount Longmen. He begged for food and drink to sustain his days, and his reputation spread far and wide.\n\nIn the *wushen* year of the Dading era, Emperor Shizong, having heard of him, summoned him by imperial courier to the capital.

I would say: the ancient recluses fell into three broad types. Some roamed freely in the wilds, their names drawing others to follow, while the sovereign’s esteem led him to seek them out; some upheld unyielding conduct, unbending to worldly custom, and though they might respond to summons, they could never be fettered by worldly affairs, leaving all to long for their bearing; others, content with meager means and delighting in mountains and forests, fled into emptiness and never returned, so that the world forever exalted their virtue and could not speak ill of them. Master Changchun embodied all three, and thus it was fitting that he received the Emperor’s questions in rustic garb, inspiring admiration and longing from all quarters. He was no profit-seeking pretender who feigned reclusion to make a name, deceiving the foolish and hoodwinking the blind for personal gain.\n\nThe Master now resides at the Pavilion of Supreme Emptiness in Mount Qixia, and the day we might meet face-to-face and sit knee-to-knee has not yet come.

heart’s release,\nWith resolve, I’ll be an immortal beyond the world’s fleece.\nThough blessings be light and demons’ snares tight,\nPersevere—merit will make all right.\n\n**Self-Portrait**\nI wander clouds and waters, lone and free,\nNo love for the red dust’s fiery spree.\nTen thousand leagues of rivers and lakes my old trade,\nA straw cloak and misty rain my life’s parade.\nDrunk, I lie on rocks, robes open wide,\nAwake, I stroll the woods, arms swinging with pride.\nWhen night deepens and clouds part their veil,\nIn the moon’s glow, I play the flute’s tale.\n\n**In Reply to Scholar Meng of Ganzhen, Beizhen Garrison (Nanchang)**\nTen years since I left my native ground,\nA drifting cloud on rivers, I in Qin Chuan found.\nLoose robes, patched when autumn winds arise,\nFull, I sleep through nights in quiet guise.\nIn Shaanxi’s west, I shun the floating world’s din,\nAt heaven’s edge, I met the Great Luo’s kin.\nYet merit falls short of immortality’s vow,\nI wait for glad tidings at Kuangyu’s brow.\n\n**In Reply to Scholar Li Si, Inviting Me to Stay North of the Wei**\nYou wrote of poetry, years ago you pledged to cross,\nBut this year I must wander—my nature resists the Way’s gloss.\nMy body and heart follow sun and moon’s flow,\nWith cliffs and vales, I pass spring and autumn’s glow.\nDeep in Guo’s town, many talents reside,\nFar they seek Panxi’s reclusive tide.\nNot that I refuse your northern abode,\nHere too the true cultivation may be bestowed.\n\n**Declining an Invitation from Daoist Friends to Visit the Temple of the Grand Duke at Panxi**\nNo wild whims urge me to roam,\nSeeing through all, I let the world go.\nWho seeks Panxi to ease their gloom?\nIn cliffs and vales, I linger slow.\nOnce three thousand li from the eastern sea,\nThrough twenty provinces my journey’s spree.\nAll famous mountains and scenes I’ve seen,\nYet nothing outside this body holds me.\n\n**Seeking a Galloping Horse at the Panxi Temple**\nI hear at Panxi the Grand Duke hides,\nWhere cliffs are high and trees dense, the shrine abides.\nOn flowered mornings, stone caves roar with dragon’s mist,\nMoonlit nights, the temple gates howl with the wind’s twist.\nFor ten thousand years, the bear’s resolve stands tall,\nThree springs, galloping steeds offer all.\nWith poetry, I seek a thousand steeds or more,\nInk-stained brushwork—my daily chore.\n\n**In Reply to Magistrate’s Son, Scholar Xu**\nTowering green junipers gird the sky’s rim,\nSheer cliffs cradle a hermit’s home within.\nThe jade grotto knows no lamp nor flame,\nGreen mountains all day wreathe in mist and frame.\nAn empty heart, a full belly—just rice I seek,\nGuests welcomed, but no tea I brew to speak.\nContent with quiet, I find my small delight,\nWhy boast of my door’s humble sight?\n\n**In Reply to the Qinghe Clan**\nThough born of mortal flesh, your spirit shines,\nYour qi upright—fit for the Dao’s designs.\nYet fear the cinnabar sinks below your navel’s gate,\nAnd white snow returns to chill your ear’s estate.\nHow to escape the red dust’s snare?\nLike me, ascend the jade peaks’ stair.\nStep by step, the Milky Way’s path I tread,\nWild clouds part as I rise, light as lead.\n\n**To Secretary Qu of Jingzhou and Provincial Graduate Liu**\nIf Daoist friends seek me out,\nNo need for gifts or formal bout.\nWorldly splendor cannot buy the Way,\nWorldly ties but weary the heart each day.\nUnlearned, indolent, my words are few,\nIn seclusion, years pass in quiet hue.\nBeyond all cares, I cast them aside,\nFrom the clouds, I listen to your lofty pride.\n\n**To Wang and Zhou, Who Visited Me**\nWhy bring a meal, you two?\nBeyond the walls, we roam the wilds anew.\nWinding through villages, you seek the Way,\nLingering in its joy, you steal the day.\nI know your old free spirit’s flight,\nFar you gaze at Xinglü’s height.\nAll day we laugh and talk at ease,\nBeneath the moon, we homeward please.\n\n**To Fellow Daoists Inquiring About Cultivation**\nMy steps drift where they may,\nWhat of cultivation can I say?\nMy Daoist eye lacks light, I shun the town,\nHeaven’s heart eludes me—I drift with the flow’s crown.\nHungry, I beg from door to door,\nFull, I sing with belly’s roar.\nBeyond this foolish self’s display,\nAll else I know not, come what may.\n\n**To Daoist Friends Seeking Worn Cloth and Old Sandals**\nSix years in the western wastes I’ve stayed,\nNo new robes nor shoes have I arrayed.\nEach mid-autumn, I patch my coarse cloak’s thread,\nBy autumn’s wind and rain, my sandals lie dead.\nA body is easily clad in cold and hunger’s sting,\nBut without fortune, time stretches long, no joy to bring.",

County**\nMist and rosy clouds fill the valley thick,\nIn profound stillness, the heart mirrors emptiness’ trick.\nLong songs sung where spring waters flow,\nAlone I sit, watching clouds in dawn winds blow.\nTo shun harm, truly rely on the Dao’s might,\nYet bestowing kindness fails to grasp the divine’s light.\nYou delve deep into scriptures’ abstruse core—\nWhy seek the eastern glow when reflection’s at the fore?\n\n**Borrowing Books from Scholar Zhang Wu of Yin County**\nA noble house, its literary fame long known,\nOrchids and jade trees fill the courtyard’s throne.\nGeneration upon generation, heroes arise,\nGathering often to discourse ‘neath virtue’s skies.\nMy humble talent embraced the Dao late,\nYet you, with vast learning, pierce the heart’s gate.\nNo need for idle jest or endless perusal—\nLend me more books to wander the ethereal.\n\n**Mid-Autumn Moon Unseen**\nFor years the bright moon fails to shine clear,\nIn vain we set jade mats, yearning year after year.\nOft resentful when rain would intervene,\nWho knew tonight clouds would veil its sheen?\nIs the Moon Goddess lost in floral slumber?\nDoes the Jade Hare still pound elixirs in haste and number?\nWorldly joys bring no true gain—\nIn the void beyond, conceal your light’s domain.\n\n**Beholding the Moon**\nDense clouds retreat, the evening breeze grows still,\nThe radiant moon’s glow stirs the Nine Lands’ will.\nTen thousand leagues of azure sky bathe in its light,\nYellow leaves of autumn chill the four quarters’ flight.\nFrom high above, the toad’s form seems to appear,\nAcross the wilds, specters are bound in fear.\nUnfettered, round, and pure—solitary, bright,\nIt drifts beyond the dust, free from earthly blight.\n\n**On the Moon Osmanthus at the Wang Residence (Borrowing Its Meaning)**\nWithin Taiyuan’s gates, the scene runs deep,\nA cluster of immortal blooms outshines all time’s sweep.\nRoots and trunk rise above the clouds’ domain,\nAncestors trace their lineage to the moon’s bright plain.\nFragrant buds, crimson-dusted, blaze,\nLush leaves, layered, lock in emerald haze.\nEach blossom’s spirit transcends the mundane—\nSoaring, they command the world’s acclaim.\n\n**Planting Moon Osmanthus**\nThe craftsman’s hand seals the moon osmanthus’ planting,\nThe recluse tends the sacred flower’s dais, enchanting.\nIts wondrous roots defy the common kind,\nIts harmonious qi marks it as the Dao’s refined.\nSun and moon converge in timeless grace,\nHeaven and earth alone command its place.\nNoble scholars, cherish this eternal spring—\nDo not mistake it for mere blossoms’ offering.\n\n**Three Poems on Mountain Dwelling**\n**I**\nDragon Gate’s waters flow, clear and bright,\nSouthward they surge ‘gainst Crimson Cliff’s height.\nTen thousand ravines’ springs converge in a rush,\nA thousand crags’ stone walls echo with a hush.\nThey cleave the red dust’s realm in their winding flight,\nUnfurling white jade’s essence in the light.\nEndless wonders—words cannot contain—\nI stand in the wind, brush in hand, to ordain.\n\n**II**\nNo grudge for gathering firewood in the deep mountain,\nFor here, a pure elegance holds its own domain.\nA stone chamber’s retreat nears the immortals’ land,\nNo need for walls—worldly affairs lie far and grand.\nFeasting, I call to cranes beyond the sky,\nGazing up, I watch eagles in the gorge fly.\nEver the shifting scenes of black and white unfold—\nTrue emptiness shines, dispelling solitude’s cold.\n\n**III**\nAlone in the mountains, solitude grows,\nIdle clouds my companions, shielding from the world’s throes.\nIndolent, I forget life’s clumsy art,\nLoving stillness, I melt into the familiar part.\nWhy feign greatness to rival Li and Du?\nWhy strive to match the immortals’ view?\nProbing life’s span and literary might—\nCan they surpass the void’s creative height?\n\n**Plantains on Longshan’s Slopes**\nA single green leaf unfurls like a palm’s embrace,\nThree cascades of white waves scatter petals in space.\nBelow the mountain, Yu’s temple overlooks the triple pool.\nBy day, guests come often to admire its rule,\nBeneath the moon, none keep it company—alone it stays.\nCreation’s vastness defies all compare—\nAmong grasses and trees, only the plantain holds sway.\nLet not the common winds and rains its grandeur impair.\n\nLet it stand daily as your golden table’s grace,\nWith guests, toast often from jade cups’ embrace.\nWhen Master Mao studied the Dao in Qi,\nNo messenger was sent—yet golden tables and jade cups appeared nigh.\n\n**In Praise of Dan Yang’s Longzhen’s Daoist Awakening**\nScholar Ma Tan reached the sacred court,\nDoubt’s ancient tangle transcended in a single sport.\nIn clouds, he gathered herbs to simmer in the golden pot,\nAfter fire’s trial, the elixir stored in jade ladle’s lot.\nA luminous pearl in hand, he wields his brush with might,\nHis heart opened to celestial strains—no need for flute’s light.\nSoon he’ll mount the crane, ride the wind away,\nBetween sea and mortal realm, his shadow fades astray.\n\n**The Crane**\nA spirit-bird of lofty nature and grace,\nCinnabar crowns its head, snow drapes its face.\nThrough vast seas it roams the Three Isles’ span,\nAcross long winds, its cry rings o’er the marshland.\nIts spirit soars, untouched by worldly ties,\nIts soaring ambition joins the immortal skies.\nBeating the wind, it trims its wings on high—\nTen thousand miles it traverses, effortless in the sky.\n\n**To Jia Gu Qingshen, Prefect of the Western Capital in Lingbei**\nFrom the Eastern Sea, my wild gaze still strains,\nThe Western Capital’s prefect yet untouched remains.\nLast year, I obeyed the edict to winter’s call,\nThis summer, your letter arrived in autumn’s thrall.\nWhen will the northern post’s honors cease?\nWhen shall I return to southern mountains’ peace?\nBest make plans for Pengcheng soon—\nThe Yan family’s customs stand firm, immune to ruin.\n\n**The Hall of Master Gong in the Western Mountains of Yizhou**\nHigh above the clouds, Master Gong’s hall gleams,\nFlickering rosy clouds bathe the cave in beams.\nPeaks of a thousand fathoms flank its side,\nTen thousand pines and cypresses in waves abide.\nThe mountain elder speaks not of past or present’s lore,\nWandering guests arrive to discourse on the primordial’s core.\nSay not a lifetime spent in seated stillness is vain—\nIt surpasses the world’s ceaseless, frantic train.\n\n**Response to the Yellow Register Ritual at Fushan County (With Preface)**\nIn the autumn of *Mingchang Jia Yin*, the ninth month, a Yellow Register Ritual was held in Fushan County. On the twenty-eighth day, just before transmitting talismans and precepts, eleven cranes soared above the altar, lingering through the night. The next day, as the ritual commenced, the Celestial Gate shook with thunderous sound, and from the North Star descended a red glow, illuminating the earth so clearly that even the finest details were discerned—seen by all, officials and common folk alike.\n\nLamps of splendor gild a mountain of gold,\nAs if Penglai’s isle lies but a hand’s span from home.\nThe unenlightened turn their hearts to open earth’s gate,\nWhile high immortals’ power stirs heaven’s domain.\nA thousand doors array their offerings in solemn flame,\nTen thousand voices unite in joyful acclaim.\nThe merit complete across the Three Realms and Ten Directions,\nColorful clouds and immortal cranes return whence they came.\n\n**After the Winter Solstice of Cheng’an Ding Si, Bitter Cold**\nAt times, affairs in the northern frontier unfold.",

      "translated_text": "Before winter’s onset and after its close, snow stretches endlessly,\nPure yang qi sinks low, all things wither and dry.\nBeyond the pass, horses startle at treacherous mountain paths,\nBorder guards endure hardship in iron-clad cold.\nThough the northern frontier suffers bitter trials,\nFortune smiles on Shandong’s scholars and common folk.\nDaily, the state expends three hundred thousand in resources—\nHow could lives not wither and fade?\n\n**Four Poems on Flat-Top Hall**\n*(At the Celestial Void Abbey of Misty Peaks)*\n\nYear after year, during the triple-heat days, I ascend Flat-Top Mountain,\nWhere travelers seldom come and go.\nEyes gaze upon the pale azure skies, clouds drifting faint,\nBody suspended in the azure void, nature at ease.\nSolitary and lofty, it soars beyond peaks and ridges,\nIts vast prospect unlike that between sea and Mount Tai.\nUnder the white sun, red-dust chariots and horses rush—\nWho could come here to lean upon the railing?\n\nThe mountain hall stands high and pure, leaning against the cool heavens,\nBeyond the sky, a clear breeze lingers in the seat.\nThe azure bird sometimes deigns to glance this way,\nWhite clouds drift all day of their own accord.\nWhere lie the golden altars and jade terraces?\nThe crimson gates and jasper towers remain undocumented in ancient times.\nHow could they compare to this mountain retreat, where one rests and withdraws,\nBody and heart unmoved, arriving at the immortal realm?\n\nBy day, the mountain hall is quiet, few visitors come,\nSurrounding seats stand tall amidst emerald peaks.\nThe azure sky is flawless as the red sun turns,\nGreen mountains unmoving while white clouds fly.\nAll things, uneven yet distinct, reveal divine transformation,\nThe three spirits, distant yet bound, unite in harmony.\nFrom beginning to end, it stems from the Dao of purity—\nIf one can embody it, heaven and earth all return to the self.\n\nThree poles of red sun linger, yet sleep remains,\nTen miles of green mountains sit in tranquil repose.\nUnaware of visitors beyond the secluded garden,\nOnly startled by a dog’s bark amid the white clouds.\nWith no intent, one naturally attains eternal wandering,\nWhat need to ask of the great return?\nOnly fear that soon the celestial music will fade,\nAnd no way to linger in joy upon Flat-Top Mountain.\n*(Written in jest.)*\n\n**Gazing at the Tides by the Sea**\nWhen the great wind rises, the northern sea grows cold,\nA thousand miles of towering waves roll like snow-capped mountains.\nTheir wrathful hue surges to the heavens, darkening the sky,\nThunderous roars erupt from the earth, startling the dusty world.\nThe river god churns waves in hidden submission,\nThe Yellow River’s spirit, shamed, overflows in sweat.\nWhite horses and plain carriages hold but empty might—\nWithout immortality, no path leads to ascent.\n\n**Inscribed at the Various Pan Abbeys**\nTen *li* southwest of the prefecture, I ascend,\nWhere springs and stones open wide to form a secluded dwelling.\nMountains deep and seas vast reflect each other,\nThe land remote, clouds idle, free to unfurl and gather.\nFlanking paths, clear pools gleam with radiance,\nTowering willows by the sky cradle the toad of the moon.\nPlaying the zither, seated before mist and rosy clouds,\nI laugh and point to the toil of life—a fleeting dream.\n\n**Mid-Autumn Day, Roaming the Various Pan Abbeys with Daoist Friends**\n*(At a time when some were preparing for the autumn examinations.)*\n\nThe crisp air clears as summer’s heat wanes,\nGardens and groves shift into brocade patterns.\nA long wind crosses the sea from the desert,\nShort shadows traverse the sky past Jade Pass.\nWe set out mats to welcome guests by the Dragon Tree,\nPlay the zither awaiting the moon by Tiger Creek.\nTrue companions naturally find the finest joys—\nNo need to pluck osmanthus in the Moon Palace.\n\n**Autumn Dawn, Roaming West Creek with Penglai Daoist Friends**\nFacing waters, ascending mountains, we ride the dawn wind,\nWith empty hearts and steady gaze, we witness the autumn sky.\nClouds veil the sea peaks in deepening emerald,\nThe sun strikes the celestial wheel in dazzling crimson.\nOur wandering spirit does not turn with other things,\nWe harmonize with the world’s dust for a time.\nThree years, four times we’ve shared this joyous gathering—\nAgain, we arrive east of the swelling sea, west of the mountains.\n\n**Written En Route**\nIn the tenth month of the second year of Mingchang, I arrived at Misty Peaks.\nIn the fifth month of the third year, Penglai Daoist friends invited me to spend summer,\nAnd thereafter, year after year, it became our custom—\nEach fifth month, they would send for me.\n\nYear after year in the fifth month, I come to Penglai,\nWhere wheat ripens like gold and silver, flowers bloom in succession.\nWandering guests sate hunger with purple mulberries,\nTravelers quench thirst awaiting yellow plums.\nClouds billow atop the peaks, linking the towering mountains,\nWaves surge at my feet, crashing from the sea.\nIn the vermilion summer, our excursions are grand and splendid,\nOur feelings vast as the celestial net.\n\n**Two Poems Seeing Off Scholar Chen and Attendant Perfect Man Wan-Yan to the Examinations**\nWithin the six directions, the myriad things are born,\nYet humans stand highest among them in clarity.\nOne who can fathom the yin-yang numbers beyond things,\nAnd seize the world’s wealth and fame—\nOf old, cinnabar required nine refinements,\nBut now the celestial path takes but three stages.\n*(Referring to the three examinations of today.)*\nWith the talent of a banished immortal, nothing lingers,\nSoon you will soar to the Great Clarity.\n\nA man of lofty integrity, his qi soars above the clouds,\nFor a decade, he has quietly studied the myriad truths.\nThough his belly is full of poetry and books, aligned with the Dao,\nHis outstanding talent has yet to astonish the world.\nThe strategies of the charging ox are unmatched,\nThe prose of the rearing steed is divinely inspired.\nOne day, when his work is complete and his heart awakens,\nHe will startle awake from the millet dream, his body still within.\n\n**Frost on the Third Day After Clear Brightness, Taihe Xinyou Year**\nJust after rain, we beheld the fairest of spring scenes,\nWhen suddenly, before the wind, ten thousand flowers withered.\nIn a single night, gardens and groves lost their color,\nThe season of triple spring grows too desolate.\nJust as the

whole county stealthily shifts—hundreds of calamities vanish.\n\n**Passing Mount Gongxian**\nGongxian’s jagged rocks forbid the horse’s tread,\nValley winds sigh, tigers elude the seeker’s gaze.\nMountains bristle like swords and halberds, vast and uneven,\nQi thickens in mist and haze, deep and obscure.\nThe Daoist throng does not idle to admire the scenery—\nEvery horizon is but a fine grove of trees.\nThus we proceed from the North Sea’s Yellow Register rites,\nWending eastward to Lai to pay homage at Emerald Peak.\n\n**Avoiding Affairs, Passing Mount Gongxian**\nLeisurely staff in hand, I tread the immortal’s trail,\nCrossing stones and threading woods toward Master Gai.\nThe Western Sea’s clouds churn darkly,\nThe Eastern Mountains’ dawn sun veils the wild geese.\nTen thousand ravines twist in deep, hidden paths,\nThree prefectures drift like tumbleweeds in the gloom.\nIn action or retreat, the heart remains unstained—\nLet the staff strike empty space at will.\n\n**Sudden Rain**\nMyriad layers of dense clouds mass,\nA thousand fathoms of white rain plunge from the mountain gate.\nYin and yang clash, wind and thunder rage,\nGrasses and trees wail as the cosmos darkens.\nBirds and beasts lose their way in the gloom,\nFish and dragons entwine in turbid waters.\nIn this instant, creation startles heaven and earth—\nWho perceives the root within a hand’s span?\n\n**Two Poems on the Great Snow of the Eighth Day of Late Winter**\n\n**I**\nLast night the south wind shifted to the north,\nBy dawn, heaven and earth were veiled in wild geese’s flight.\nScattered pearls and shattered jade follow high and low,\nTen thousand ravines and a thousand peaks merge in sameness.\nSun and moon know not where to settle,\nMountains and rivers are sealed in boundless obscurity.\nOnly in returning to observe the principles of yin and yang and life’s nature\nDo I recognize the workings of emptiness and creation.\n\n**II**\nLast night the south wind shifted to the north,\nBy dawn, heaven and earth were veiled in wild geese’s flight.\nMountain hamlets and rustic inns differ house by house,\nWillow fluff and plum blossoms are alike everywhere.\nClouds withdraw from pine halls and stone chambers,\nJade terraces and crystal pavilions gleam in the moonlight.\nWhy inquire further of the omen of a bountiful year?\nThis profound beauty is the very work of the Great Dao.\n\n**Two Poems in Response to Prefect Zhang of Dinghai Commandery’s Visit in the Snow**\n\n**I**\nThe ritual hall lies deep, its curtains undrawn,\nIn pure fasting, I sit in stillness, oblivious to schemes.\nHeavenly flowers drift down in profusion,\nThe sea’s moon glows faintly over the vast mountains.\nThe pale sun drifts through the golden hall at dawn,\nThe piercing wind scatters jade-like dust in flight.\nThis auspicious snow of midwinter is true joy—\nYet through the ages, who discerns right from wrong?\n\n**II**\nAuspicious snow flutters, my rustic mood runs deep,\nI open the gate, staff in hand, lingering at ease.\nGreedily watching the six-petaled jade flowers fall,\nI fail to notice the Three Clarities’ halls sealed in snow.\nDark fields and plains reveal jade steeds,\nThe palace’s eaves trail golden dragons in concealment.\nAmid the cold crags, the lofty one stands—\nWhich distant peak is the first, the second, or the third?\n\n**The Bamboo Pavilion of the Great Void Abbey**\nThis small pavilion’s secluded balustrade bears no flowers,\nOnly jade-green bamboo, sovereign of the year’s splendor.\nIts upright stalks are no common grass or tree,\nIts hollow heart truly befits the Daoist’s livelihood.\nThe wind’s soughing brings a chill fragrance,\nThe rain’s cleansing leaves it purer still.\nIt need not wait for the year’s cold to prove its worth—\nBy my chanting window, morning and night, it embodies flawless integrity.\n\n**Reflections on Climbing Heights**\nI urge my horse up the high ridge, its hooves unsteady,\nGazing upon the vast earth, my heart trembles.\nMountains and rivers stretch boundless to the sky,\nGrotto heavens and immortals dwell far from the world.\nWhite jade and yellow gold are never truly held,\nSpring blossoms and autumn moons are never truly possessed.\nA hundred years pass like a fleeting dream of floating life—\nAll things prove illusory, leaving only regret’s desolation.\n\n**Two Poems for Master Liu Shiru**\nPrefect of Dinghai Commandery, retired from office, Master Liu Shiru visits with his son at the Great Void Abbey in Qixia.\n\n**I**\nSeveral riders lightly depart the prefectural city,\nThe west wind sways, chrysanthemums gleam pure.\nReciting poems on horseback, no lance in hand,\nI seek the Dao among men, briefly washing my cap strings.\nDew falls, the sky soars, autumn’s air is crisp,\nGolden chimes and jade vibrations brighten the dawn clouds.\nAll day in the mountain hall, I sit in tranquil solitude—\nAs if sensing the floating life’s dream grow faint.\n\n**II**\nMaster Shiru has a retreat for rest and repose, named the Central Chamber.\nHe further requests a poem.\n\nThat which is called the Dao is the interplay of yin and

toward goodness.\nDaoists revere the seventh [month],\nBuddhists turn the eighth [wheel].\nEach year’s end, they gather in great numbers,\nAfter noon, before the sacred icons, they chant scriptures and repent—\nThis is called *Ritual Rectification*.\nOnly when the month concludes does it end.\n\nSnow clears, spring’s light reveals great peace,\nWind gentle, sun warm—all the brighter.\nSing high in assembly, cast off melancholy,\nBoil round cakes crisp for *Ritual Rectification*.\n\n**In Reply to Scholar Fan**\nAsk not how the threads of fate are woven,\nOnly cultivate hidden virtue, thoughts ever renewed.\nHuman sentiments shift like the Dao of immortals—\nIn daily practice, exert all your strength.\n\n**For Daoist Friend Liu the Second**\nThis man loves wine and chess.\nWhen merry, he drinks a thousand cups of wine,\nIn stillness, he plays a game of chess.\nWhite-haired years should serve as a distant mirror,\nRed-dust trifles—know them not too well.\n\n**Two Poems Admonishing Qiang of Jingyang**\nSu Qin, Lu Jia—all return to emptiness,\nThrough the ages, the wise wake from one dream.\nHow much better to forget cunning and seal the lips,\nSilently seize the nine-heaven wind!\n\nA hundred years, ten thousand affairs—all a void,\nSwift as a fleeting shadow through a crack.\nWhy do men of the floating world not awaken?\nFoolish hearts still grasp at spring’s breeze.\n\n**To Layman Yang the Fifth**\nI wished to send a poem, but paper was lacking,\nSifting through scrolls, I found an old letter.\nAfter it, I earnestly inscribed a quatrain,\nUrging you: do good, do not hesitate.\n\n**Returning the Paper Fan Bestowed by Yang the Fifth**\nGrateful for your gift of white banana-leaf fan,\nIn mountain valleys, winds rise without summons.\nIn the city’s scorching days, no cool air comes—\nI beg you, hold it and leisurely wave.\n\n**In Reply to Scholar Qiao**\nNewly widowed, he seeks to still his heart and enter the Dao.\nBeyond the world, his heart returns, cutting off the great demon,\nIn leisure, he sings even more loftily.\nThe mind’s terrace now bears few desires,\nHis sturdy bones will ride the wind in days to come.\n\n**Inscribed on Yang the Fifth’s Paper Fan**\nTowering peaks press against the heavens,\nPrecipitous cliffs, distant mists clinging.\nSince ancient times, visitors to Mount Song,\nHaughty immortals of Mount Hua.\n\n**Inscribed on Scholar Wang’s Paper Fan**\nI love the boundless sky, summer days long,\nWho hates the cruel heat, the blazing clouds?\nThe triple-burner’s toxic heat, years of it, now gone—\nOne grasp of cool wind brings eternal chill.\n\n**Inscribed on Scholar Qiao’s Paper Fan**\nFiery sun, flying clouds of flame,\nWayfarers on the road bathe in sweat.\nIn the deep green caves of the mountains, carefree guests\nRecline beneath pines, playing chess at ease.\n\n**Inscribed on Wang the Second’s Paper Fan**\nAfter the *Ruibin* [fifth lunar month] heat grows fiercer,\nToxic warmth steams, nowhere to hide.\nOnly in the emerald caves of Ever-Spring Mountain\nDoes coolness linger all day, naturally serene.\n\n**Inscribed on Zhou Daoquan’s Paper Fan**\nStream winds sigh like descending frost,\nGully waters ripple like churning snow.\nAll day, no toil or burden weighs—\nWhen will stifling heat return?\n\n**Inscribed on Madam Pang’s Rattan Fan**\nDelicate patterns woven in silver threads,\nGentle breezes scatter jade-like grace.\nThough autumn’s gales bring crispness,\nFor you, it will not be long.\n\n**Chen Family Thatched Hall by the Luo River**\nA thatched hall stands high in half the grove’s shade,\nTall trees, uneven, deep green bamboo.\nNo sound of carriages or horses—fame and profit far,\nIn quietude all day, the heart finds rest.\n\n**Scholar Duan’s Raft Lost to Rising Waters**\nScholar Duan launched his raft down Western Mountain,\nJust as waves surged, sweeping all beyond the pass.\nTurning back, he bore no grudge against the River Lord,\nSinging high, rejoicing in his light return.\n\n**Flying Immortals**\nPenglai, Fangzhang, and Yingzhou,\nThe three isles’ immortals wander as one.\nMerged with the nine heavens, no hindrance,\nThey soar through the eight directions, freely roaming.\n\n**Painting of Zhong and Lü**\nNo self, no other—nature free,\nMaster and disciple converse in harmony.\nExpounding scriptures, teaching Dharma on the three mountains,\nRiding mists, soaring clouds, a thousand miles they roam.\n\n**Two Poems on Dwelling in Mount Jingfu**\nTigers roar in fierce winds, beasts startle,\nDemons meet in long nights, sleep’s soul trembles.\nWhen will the simple and upright Dao-heart appear?\nThe sun of wisdom dawns, the heavenly eye opens.\n\nJingfu’s depths, worldly affairs few,\nDragon Gate’s tranquility, Tiger Creek’s clarity.\nAt times, the cry of the red pheasant—*jieguo jiazha*—\nLike the creaking of an axle’s lock.\n\nA kind of red pheasant in the mountains\nMakes the sound *jieguo jiazha*.\nWoodcutters entering the hills\nJoke that it is \"snow settled.\"\nThe descending call turns to *goujia gezhe*—\nThe partridge’s cry.\n\n**Four Poems Expressing My Aspirations**\nI seek the Dao, letting my spirit roam free,\nAt Dragon Gate, tigers now and then intrude.\nOn mountain peaks, fierce fires blaze in midwinter,\nIn ravine depths, yin winds chill the fifth month.\n\nThe subtle principle of pure emptiness spans the world,\nThe great simplicity’s honest breeze fills the age.\nThe supreme Dao has a name—where is its reality?\nThe enlightened speak not, yet know and return.\n\nThe root of entering the Dao lies in self-commitment,\nWho knows the message of transcending the dust?\nFirst, *Nanhua* brings carefree joy,\nFinally, the boundless sea meets its vast appointment.\n\nWild cranes, solitary clouds—my livelihood,\nCool winds, bright moon—my Daoist life.\nA thousand mountains, piled high, gather cloud and mist,\nThe four seas, radiant, gleam with sunlight.\n\n**Four Poems on Yang of Longzhou Bringing Moon Osmanthus to Visit**\nBuried in dust, how pitiable,\nFollowing worldly ways for years.\nBy chance, a noble scholar roams hills and waters,\nMeeting lofty immortals, companions of sages.\n\nA lone branch, elegant, leans on cold mountains,\nAll flowers of the four seas bow in shame.\nIf it meets a fine wind and auspicious air,\nHeavenly fragrance will drift through the world.\n\nFrom first breath, it received the true essence,\nPassing on splendor, linking fragrance like fire.\nAmong the world’s hundred flowers, none

opened teachings,\nWho would know that movement and stillness are fundamentally empty?\nA thousand scriptures, ten thousand treatises offer expedient means,\nPrecious registers and jade cases inspire all goodness.\nFrom ancient roots in the unseen,\nTo this day, the Dao and virtue still shine.\nOf late, the world’s teachings flourish,\nThe enlightened transform beings wherever they go.\nI too have

solemnity,\nFor nine mornings, the steps of emptiness echo in circles.\nA thousand gates and ten thousand doors brim with joy,\nThe six streets and three markets all adorned.\nGold flowers and silver candles gleam in radiance,\nInner and outer light pierce through.\nSuddenly from the void, auspicious signs appear,\nA desolate wheel turns—something extraordinary.\nThe Jade Emperor proclaims a great amnesty,\nImmortal youths ride cranes down to Nanchang.\nLost souls and lingering spirits all ascend,\nWhite-haired elders and yellow-haired children all admire.\nSuch fine deeds are unheard of at the world’s edge,\nOutshining all in Shandong and Hebei.\n\n**The New Abbey North of Weizhou City**\nTranquility need not lie in reclusive suffering,\nWhere the heart is dust-free, all places suit.\nNorth of the lush prefectural city,\nLand rich with flowers and trees, scenes full of wonder.\nOnce, carriages and horses clamored in vain,\nNow transformed into the Jade Purity Abbey.\nWho plays within the abbey?\nAll under heaven who come and go—free wanderers.\nPonds and pavilions lie quiet, veiled in mist and rosy clouds,\nThe great treasure lotus blooms a ten-zhang flower.\nI ask: who is the benefactor of this enterprise?\nThe ennobled Qianhu, Lord Tai of the great household.\n\n**Inscribed at the Yuntun Abbey on Mount Yuntun in Zhaoyuan County, Laizhou**\nOn Mount Yuntun, clouds shroud

      "translated_text": "**Five-Character Regulated Verse on the Withered Catalpa in Madam Zhan’s Courtyard**\n*Composed by Qiu Chuji, the Long Spring Daoist of Mount Qixia*\n\n**Preface:**\nSouth of Liaocheng, in the household of the Zou clan, there lived a woman named Madam Zhan, originally from Penglai. From birth, she possessed a nimble mind, deftly weaving silk threads into birds, fish, insects, flowers, and grasses—each form taking shape without need of pattern, flowing effortlessly from her hands. Her craftsmanship surpassed that of the living by far.\n\nAfter her husband’s death in middle age, she remained a widow, her devotion to the Dao profound. She built a hermitage and set out offerings to welcome the cloud-and-mist companions of the four directions, a practice she maintained for many years. Yet before long, frivolous tongues wove slanderous whispers, tarnishing her steadfast integrity like pine and bamboo besmirched by mud.\n\nRealizing the futility of clearing her name, she gathered her kin and, pointing to the withered catalpa in the courtyard, made this vow before the immortals: *\"If my conduct bears not the slightest fault, let this tree revive in glory. Should I prove false, I shall bear the shame alone and swear never to share the same sky and sun as you.\"* Months passed after her prayer, yet the tree showed no sign of life.\n\nThe villagers mocked her, jeering: *\"If this tree blooms again, not only will your virtue be proven, but we too shall grow rich and noble!\"* Madam Zhan heard their words as if in a spring dream.\n\nThat catalpa had been planted in the *gengzi* year of the Dading era (1180). No sooner had it taken root than it withered, battered by wind and rain for nearly five years until its form decayed beyond hope of revival. Yet in the summer of the following *jisi* year (1199)—the very month of Madam Zhan’s prayer—suddenly, a miraculous sprout emerged from the dead wood. Crimson as sacred grass, it stretched forth branches and lush leaves day by day, until its foliage shaded the courtyard steps.\n\nI first heard this tale while in Shaanxi, though I did not witness it myself. By the *xinhai* year of the Mingchang era (1191), as I passed through this prefecture, the streets and lanes still resounded with its praise.",

      "translated_text": "Upon lodging in Madam Zhan’s courtyard, I at last confirmed the truth of the matter. Six years have now passed since the tree’s revival. Its height spans twice a man’s reach, its branches and boughs luxuriant, unlike any common wood. Four lateral shoots emerge, sturdy and sinewy, their bearing lofty as if straining toward the clouds. Master Changchun observed: “Utmost sincerity moves things; luminous virtue stirs Heaven—does this not describe Madam Zhan? Who says the Dao is distant? The fault lies only in man’s failure to cultivate true virtue.” Thus I composed forty words to record this wondrous response.\n\n*On the day of...*\nOutsiders slander with idle tongues,\nYet with empty heart she prayed for proof.\nThe long catalpa’s roots had rotted,\nYet from withered stump, fresh shoots arose.\nMeng’s lament for yellow bamboo,\nTian Zhen’s sigh for purple brier—\nOf old, filial piety was praised;\nToday, loyalty stands revealed.\n\n**Reply to Meng’an of Guoxian County**\nEnamored of this land untouched by men,\nI soar high, freed from the crow’s cage.\nReciting poems to pass the idle days,\nObserving transformations in the still wind.\nStaff in hand, I roam south of Southern Mountain,\nSinging boldly east of Western Slope.\nHow many red-dust affairs exist?\nNone reach the realm of white clouds.\n\n**Reply to Scholar Li Si of Guoxian County**\nIn deepest winter, most carefree,\nShort days hasten my rounds.\nStanding alone beyond the red dust,\nI chant poems before emerald peaks.\nGlancing sideways at the cave’s mouth,\nMy bright gaze rests on mountain summits.\nGazing afar at snowy green peaks,\nBrilliant white mirrors the sky.\n\n**Visiting Huaidao Village South of Mount Zhongnan, Lodging in a Bamboo Garden**\nSeeking the Dao in Huaidao,\nMy feelings far from worldly passions.\nAt ease, my spirit soars;\nHalf-asleep, my dreams still stir.\nThe immortal’s courtyard, elegant in its scenery,\nJade groves bathed in moonlight’s clarity.\nA scholar truly finds delight—\nWhy cling to purple-robed honors?\n\n**In Praise of Master Changsheng**\nWhose blessed company do I keep?\nAmong immortals, who is most favored?\nThe eminent scholar of Donglai,\nThe renowned figure of Xiluo.\nLater, he received the ancestral teachings;\nHe was the last to leave the household,\nFirst to establish the model of Dao and virtue.\nDeeply he knew the power of youth,\nThus moved by sages’ support.\n\n**In Praise of Master Yuyang**\nA true immortal of the ancient land,\nA great man of the Eastern Realm.\nPure and lofty, how unlike the vulgar,\nBright and untrammeled, beyond worldly dust.\nInner and outer gifts bestowed by Heaven,\nHis conduct and retreat peerless in the age.\nTimely he discerns fortune and misfortune,\nHis proofs silently commune with the divine.\n\n**Inscribed at the Temple of the Great Duke of Panxi**\nOne scene unites high and low,\nThree peaks stand guard through ancient and modern times.\nThe path winds through cloud-washed caves,\nThe shrine nestles deep by the angling stream.\nFrom crevices, flying springs burst forth,\nAncient cypresses shade the sky.\nHow joyous this pure and secluded place—\nFit to gladden the heart of a rustic.\n\n**Spring Day Excursion**\nEmerging from the Hall of Azure Clouds,\nI turn and gaze across the eight wilds.\nClouds disperse, a thousand li made clear,\nWind scatters the fragrance of a hundred flowers.\nThe sea of desire stirs distant sorrows,\nSpring mountains awaken lasting delight.\nLeaning on my staff, the climb complete,\nI plunge deep into the land of intoxication.\n\n**First Snow**\nLast night’s rain turned to snow,\nThis morning the earth transformed to silver.\nThe window brightens, yet dawn has not come;\nThe wilds darken, yet dust is no more.\nFrom the sea, golden waves grow pale,\nAcross the sky, jade trees stand new.\nAt first sight, purity fills the eyes—\nEnough to stir the poet’s heart.\n\n**Autumn Rain**\nFor two nights, Heaven sends down rain,\nIn clear autumn, the earth swells with waves.\nGloom veils sun and moon,\nSurging waters swell rivers and streams.\nAt the Purple Frontier, returning geese bear sorrow,\nOn green mountains, recluses sing their songs.\nUnfazed, I dwell in my stone chamber,\nHigh-pillowed, chanting amidst mist and vines.\n\n**Leaving the Capital**\nJust beyond the imperial capital,\nI chant poems, my rustic spirit soaring.\nThe parrot, freed from its cage, is splendid;\nThe phoenix, spreading its wings, is wondrous.\nA white horse gallops lightly,\nGreen mountains drift slowly by.\nChang’an, a brocade of a thousand pieces—\nUndoubtedly, I shall arrive soon.\n\n**Ascending Western Mountain of Yizhou**\nLifting my robes, I tread barren ground,\nFrom the summit, I survey the autumn’s minutiae.\nDeep valleys plunge into dark abysses,\nJumbled peaks rise in towering layers.\nThe forest’s chill chills to the bone,\nMy eyes strain with the vastness.\nLaughing at this heartless wanderer,\nHow can I compare to the gibbons of cassia cliffs?\n\n**Inscribed at Mount Ai**\nA single dark cloud, cold and aloft,\nStands solitary amidst the distant haze.\nHeaven hangs over the vast blue sea,\nEarth anchors the leisurely white clouds.\nThough its name is hidden among the Five Peaks,\nThe path to the Three Spirits may yet be climbed.\nAt times, I observe stones transformed by touch,\nSweet dew anointing the dusty world.\n\n**Gazing Toward Kunlun**\nOnce I dwelled in Kunlun’s land,\nA single glance southeast brings joy.\nJade peaks array like sea and mountains,\nCloud brocade scatters like heavenly flowers.\nQi gathers, concentrating triple excellence,\nSpirit clears, surpassing the Nine Flowers.\nNow, as spring snow melts,\nMy eyes brim with cinnabar white.\n\n**Ascending Penglai Pavilion**\nOnce atop Penglai Pavilion,\nWith empty heart, I gaze into the distance.\nClouds shift, mountains seem to grow,\nWaters reach the sea and vanish.\nBelow, I peer into the dragons’ lair,\nBeside me, I watch the magpies’ bridge.\nWhy fear the distant, weightless ascent?\nThe cinnabar heavens lie close at hand.\n\n**Gazing at the Sea**\nSea’s hue swallows Heaven’s hue,\nWind’s voice mingles with water’s voice.\nClouds churn, startling fish and turtles,\nThunder roars, shocking gods and spirits.\nWaves surge against a thousand perilous cliffs,\nVast and boundless, a myriad li of calm.\nNow, without a fisher of giant turtles,\nWho will cast a line to hook the great whale?\n\n**Mountain Hall After Rain Clears**\nMorning sun, three poles high, shines bright,\nA thousand peaks stretch level in the distance.\nChanting high, my spirit grows ever freer,\nGazing far, my eyes grow ever clearer.\nAfter rain, the eaves drip with moisture,\nWind arrives, the seat grows cool.\nIf one’s heart is not aligned with the Dao,\nDo not let them pass my gate.\n\n**Two Poems on the Moon at Midnight**\n**I**\nThe midnight moon, steadfast and bright,\nWalks alone where none accompany.\nBelow, it joins the white of the blue sea,\nAbove, it fills the void with purity.\nIts traces leave the Three Isles,\nIts light roams, illuminating ten thousand cities.\nIn those cities, how many guests lie,\nToo deep in sleep to be stirred.\n\n**II**\nThe midnight moon, steadfast and bright,\nShines alone where none accompany.\nAt the sky’s edge, the Dipper dims,\nOn earth, a hundred evils take fright.\nWild cranes are faintly discerned,\nA host of dragons soar and cry.\nOn ordinary nights of the fifteenth,\nNever has it been so clear.\n\n**Early Winter: Rain Delays the Purchase of a Horse**\nIn the tenth month, torrential rain,\nAt the third watch, roaring waves.\nFloating clouds link sea and peaks,\nRushing waters flood the mountain city.\nWilds darken, wind and waves rage,\nMud deepens, roads collapse.\nTravelers and galloping horses alike\nRace through the night till dawn.\n\n**First Snow**\nAs the tenth month draws to a close,\nBy chance, I see the six-petaled snowflakes fly.\nScattered and swift in the whirling wind,\nIntricate and faint as night falls.",

abides through all ages,\nYet living beings never fathom the heart.\nOf the five fortunes, only long life stands high;\nOf the three luminaries, only humans align.\n\nLeisurely I pass the years,\nUnfettered, unbound by dust.\nSages and worthies are not far from the Dao—\nVirtue lies in human cultivation.\nIf not sought within this heart,\nWhere else could it be found?\n\n---\n\n**Twenty Poems on Cultivating the Dao**\n\nEyes and ears depart from sound and color,\nBody and mind transcend being and non-being.\nNaturally, one communes with creation—\nWhy debate the fine or coarse?\n\nThe qi-refining, heart-cleansing adept\nSoars above the world, a towering standard.\nThe heart, steadfast as a mountain,\nQi, ceaseless as the tides.\n\nTen thousand cares melt like wax,\nThe three poisons dissolve like ice.\nOnce free from the yin-yang shell,\nWhat need to debate Mahāyāna or Hīnayāna?\n\nThe five eyes share one essence,\nThe three bodies branch from a single stem.\nWhen the inch of heart is free of self,\nPerfect enlightenment illumines the void.\n\nSelf-arising, self-vanishing,\nNeither shallow nor deep.\nFailing to realize the body is not the self,\nHow can one grasp that things are the mind?\n\nTrampling the realm of emptiness,\nShattering the power of creation.\nFloating clouds gather in stillness,\nThe sun of wisdom lights the zenith of meditation.\n\nWhere does a single word reside?\nTen thousand matters leave no trace.\nCreation opens the celestial cavern,\nThe spirit endures the biting cold.\n\nThough the eye’s faculties serve their use,\nThe mind’s ground rests in clarity.\nFor now, within this dream of life,\nI wander freely with the myriad transformations.\n\nThe body may be narrow as a square foot,\nYet the heart spans

void.\nLapis lazuli cradles the jewel moon,\nA net of pearls spans the heavens.\n\nAscending to truth, no turbid qi remains,\nTranscending the world, one bears a pure standard.\nSwiftly I depart the long night,\nObscurely I rise to the highest heavens.\n\nThe jade crucible boils with cinnabar,\nThe golden flask brims with fragrant wine.\nGhosts and spirits cannot fathom the heart,\nHeaven and earth defy the measure of time.\n\nAwakened from the dream of Huaxu,\nThe spirit roams the Purple Palace of Heaven.\nI invite companions from the three isles,\nLeisurely visiting immortals of the ten continents.\n\nThe Dao is attained through non-action,\nDharma arises from the mind’s intent.\nIf one can dissolve the three poisons,\nOne ought to transcend the five phases.\n\nThe Dao manifests

welcome.\n\nThe herb gardens and mushroom fields are pristine,\nThe golden altar and jade halls renewed.\nWithin the gourd, night never falls,\nBeyond the world, spring is eternal.\n\nThe ten caves

thousand forms.\nMountains and rivers coil around the earth’s axis,\nSun and moon course through the celestial wheel.\n\nIn the indistinct, spirit is the trunk,\nIn the misty, qi is the sprout.\nHeaven and earth are like long leaves,\nSun and moon resemble blossoms unfurled.\n\nThe Dao governs the flourishing of yin and yang,\nHeaven perfects the work of creation.\nGhosts and spirits’ essence remains unseen,\nYet the qi of mountains and seas flows in secret.\n\nThe Dao governs the flourishing of yin and yang,\nHeaven bestows the essence of rain and dew.\nThe three lights shine together,\nThe myriad transformations all take form.\n\nThe Dao governs the flourishing of yin and yang,\nHumans receive the grace of rain and dew.\nThrough darkness and light, they follow sun and moon,\nCreation emerges from heaven and earth.\n\nGreat simplicity embraces primordial qi,\nFrom no direction, it receives the divine.\nThe divine penetrates creation,\nPrimordial qi weaves the warp and weft.\n\nGreat sages open heaven and earth,\nAcross the vast expanse, they array sun and stars.\nRevolving, they divide day and night,\nThrough past and present, they illumine living

River,\nWestward into Panxi’s countryside.\nBefore the vast valley’s cliffs, beside the secluded stream,\nI carve a cloud-high niche to rest my trace.\nNo smoke nor fire, no basket nor gourd laid by,\nWhat daily needs have I to store?\nHungry, I eat; thirsty, I drink,\nSeeking sustenance through village lanes as time allows.\nCold or hot, scraps or leftovers,\nFill my gut, no need for rare delicacies.\nWeak or strong, I make do to pass the day,\nSpared the toil of kitchen labor.\nThe skin-bag is clad, its pores steamed,\nTo moisten and replenish its fluids.\nThe colored body light and hale,\nThe Dharma-body easily nurtured.\n\n**#2 Upholding Resolve in the Cold of Winter**\nAmidst auspicious clouds and auspicious snow,\nIn the depths of winter’s frozen, sealed season,\nA mountain hut stands silent and solitary,\nAll day without a soul to speak to.\nTattered sleeves worn again, alone in the cold cave,\nThe long night’s sorrow hard to endure.\nThrough endless watches, no sleep comes,\nThe north wind howls through the door, piercing and bleak.\nMorning, I seek rice in the western village,\nBy the spring-lined path, jade-like leaves and frost-flowers form.\nIn Shaanxi grows a kind of grass, two feet tall, nameless.\nIn autumn and winter, its upper stem dies, the lower lives on.\nAt dawn’s chill, between the half-stems, ice forms two ridges,\nLike the fletching of an arrow.\nFrostbitten hands warmed by breath, yet still I resent\nThis impure frame, this mediocre mortal flesh.\nDay and night, hunger and cold press in,\nWhen will I transcend birth and death?\nI must rely on steadfast will,\nTo shatter the moon of the ancient heart.\n\n**#3 The Chessboard**\nThe road ahead is long, its splendor yet unseen—\nGolden, jade-like, the immortal’s spirit and form.\nIn solitude, with no merit, heaven bestows upon me\nA chessboard to brighten my face and while away the days.\nBefore the Ancient Minister’s Cliff, upon the Clear Wind Terrace,\nI linger till the morning meal is done.\nA recluse comes to visit,\nOur refined hearts delight in the game’s subtle strategies.\nAt first, like riverside or seashore,\nIn threes and fives, scattered cranes and crows emerge.\nBreaking ranks, charging passes, forming arrays,\nTangled like coiling dragons and serpents.\nBrilliant calculations, clever schemes,\nDiagonal leaps and straight advances—\nTen thousand changes all return to one.\nIn boundless divine function,\nNo need for arts beyond the world.\n\n**#4 In Praise of the Master**\nVast and boundless, the bitter sea,\nLike the eastern deep—profound, wide, bottomless.\nEndless sentient beings, topsy-turvy in competition,\nLike fish at play, vying in the waves.\nTossed by towering swells, submerged in surging waves,\nTheir cravings like drunken madness.\nAdrift without end,\nHow few become soaring Peng to transcend!\nOnly that day’s Chongyang,\nClear-eyed and awakened, alone held lofty aspirations.\nStudying the *Yi* in advanced years, his heart fully enlightened,\nHe snapped the reins of fleeting vanity.\nAfter ten years, the elixir perfected,\nIn an instant, his work complete—\nShedding his shell like a cicada’s molt.\nSince parting from the Master,\nWho else has carried on his noble example?\n\n**#5 The Straw Cape**\nBy the ancient banks of the deep stream,\nWhen autumn comes, the sedge grows thick and lush without end.\nSelecting the long and short, I return to the grotto,\nWhere the empty sky’s sunlight dries them.\nTwo bundles of silk dried, a thousand strands bound,\nNo need for skilled craftsmen’s discernment.\nIn my leisurely pavilion, I myself\nKnit the fisherman’s garb.\nAt times, I roam with woodcutters and herders,\nThrough green mountains and emerald waters,\nWith rain and mist as my companions.\nExquisite beyond compare, to treasure in the twilight of secluded paths,\nDonning it to push through reeds and rushes in the snow.\nI have forgotten my name,\nOthers all call me by another—\nThe Straw Cape Guest.\nPanxi calls me the Straw Cape Master.\nWhen my work is complete in years to come,\nI shall transform into clouds, vanishing without trace in the heavens.\n\n**#6 The Bamboo**\nHollow-hearted, emerald bamboo,\nEndowed by nature with a singular purity.\nBeneath the moon, before the wind, fit for admiration,\nIts banter free of worldly俗.\nTender leaves rustling,\nEven in deep winter, they stand out amidst a thousand woods.\nIts noble bearing, lustrous and smooth,\nLike the cold jade of the Mystic Garden.\nThe good-hearted Lord Tian of Eastern Li—\nThe abbot of the eastern neighbor’s hermitage—\nNewly planted them by South Stream,\nOpening my eyes to verdant hues.\nAll day I gaze beyond the window, chanting high,\nAs the wind stirs the green tips of the bamboo.\nGently wafting, its subtle fragrance,\nSparse shadows swaying, soothing body and flesh.\nA tranquil companion in the cloud niche,\nIts refined spirit befits an immortal’s blessing.\n\n**#7 The Moon**\nNestled by cliffs and ridges,\nThe long night’s stillness deepens—\nDesolate, the demon of dusk is not alone.\nThe bright moon, clear and luminous, appears over the mountain,\nIts radiance at the edge of heaven just emerging.\nDew congeals, frost forms,\nGolden splendor, jade-like luster,\nHow ethereal and free!\nIts purity descends upon the world,\nRevealing the divine beauty of its form.\nMournful, the six directions’ multitudes,\nSunken in darkness, grieving in toil and sickness.\nThe great Dharma’s good causes widely spread salvation,\nAll attain carefree tranquility.\nVast qi surges,\nIts lingering light suffuses—\nHow could this true nature ever falter?\nThe perfect brightness of the Dharma-realm,\nThe Dharma-wheel ever self-sustaining.\n\n**#8 Late Autumn**\nFrost-laden winds sweep and stir,\nDancing, scattering leaves slant across the paths.\nGazing to the farthest reaches of the long fields,\nWithered chrysanthemums, mottled, still bloom.\nSpecks of gray-green moss,\nEndless morning dew,\nGradually congealing into white frost.\nMountains high and low,\nAll become a single hue of autumn.\nUnfettered, all things wither and decay,\nThe weather desolate and bleak,\nSaddening the traveler on the road.\nThe roots of clouds in valleys offer no delight,\nOnly the verdant pines and cypresses remain.\nThose who awaken to the Dao, true immortals,\nThose who forget worldly schemes, recluses—\nFrom ancient times, they share this standard.\nDefying the cold, surpassing the multitude,\nEver since heaven and earth began, they have been thus endowed.\n\n**#9 Confused Longing**\nThe four seas and myriad mountains,\nAt dusk, the sky clears—\nDispelling lurking yin demons.\nBefore the Taiyi Cliff, the wind’s path swift,\nA

take the shape of Mount Taihua,\ntheir layered ridges steep, dyeing the sky with azure.\nSudden rain pours like ink from an overturned basin,\nwhile swift thunder and flashing lightning roar.\n\n**Mighty spirits!**\nThey unleash their divine powers,\nturning the scorching heat of triple summer to solid ice.\nYet alas, where the whirlwind passes,\ngood fields are ravaged,\nand grand houses topple.\nOnly in this land of the Dao do blessings flow,\nwhere sudden lightness follows ceaseless tears.\nI deeply trust that Heaven aids virtue,\nand the fruits of good and evil are clearly divided.\n\n---\n\n**To the Tune of \"Gazing at the Sea Tide\"**\n**On Cultivating the Dao**\n\nThe demeanor of immortals,\nthe gateway to longevity—\nfrom ancient times, virtue and the Dao have been their foundation.\nAll else, if pursued with even a single thought,\nleads to madness and folly, all in vain.\nThe true teaching dispels delusion,\nhanded down since the days of the Yellow Emperor,\nwho soared on a dragon’s chariot.\nPassed through generations,\nto this day, all return to its embrace.\n\nThe void and nothingness—\na rule shared by a thousand sages.\nFor it crushes cravings and desires,\nrevealing the secrets of heaven.\nGreed and profit are like enemies;\nseeing the body as a dream,\none clings to excess, neglecting appearance.\nReturn to simplicity, embrace the subtle and serene.\nLet your face be unwashed, your hair disheveled,\nclad in paper robes and hempen garments.\nWhen merit is complete, cast all aside,\nand wander the vast expanse,\nstepping upon clouds and rainbows.\n\n---\n\n**To the Tune of \"Breaking Free from the Mundane\"**\n\nA steadfast foundation,\na tranquil gateway—\nthis life is unlike worldly ties.\nIn secluded, vast mountains,\nenlightened beings of the highest order\nmeander, emulating immortals.\nDiligently they labor before the cliffs,\nslowly planting osmanthus and pines,\ntending herb gardens and fields of lingzhi.\nBeneath peaks ten thousand fathoms high,\nthey keep company with tortoises and cranes,\npassing the years in ease.\n\nMy heart has long been set on the remote and strange,\nloving the simplicity of bamboo baskets and gourd ladles,\nmocking the clamor of poetry and prose.\nBy secluded caves and small streams,\nI open my heart to joy,\nsometimes composing short verses, sometimes long.\nRacing horses outpace flowered stationery;\nfreely I wield my brush, chanting wildly,\nmoving through mist and flying smoke.\nUnrestrained, in suchness I abide,\nmingling through the days,\ncarefree and content.\n\n---\n\n**To the Tune of \"Drunken Immortal in Penglai\"**\n**On the Ninth Day of the Ninth Month, the Liu Family of Xigu Holds a Ritual**\n\nSuddenly, the Three Pure

observed,\nthe empty hall hosts the ritual,\ncelebrating the great immortals’ grace.\nLibations overflow in rosy cups,\nlong songs and wondrous melodies\nlinger in the master’s heart.\n\nThis double ninth day,\nchrysanthemums bloom in profusion—\njust as the Double Yang arrives,\nthe pure autumn air is finest.\nFragrant winds scatter,\nand red osmanthus sways in the crisp breeze.\nSuch rare beauty is seldom met,\nand the highest immortals are hard to encounter—\nfortunate to meet in this moment.\nWild geese cast shadows on the sand,\nmoonlight illuminates the night,\nand all grow mellow with wine.\n\n---\n\n**To the Tune of \"Joy of Heaven\"**\n**Remembering Dharma Kin**\n\nFrom the eastern shores of the sea,\noriginally of three provinces,\nfour of us formed a bond.\nIn foreign lands and distant towns,\nwe walked and sat together,\npassing days in shared play.\nWe spoke of mysteries, discussed wonders,\nexploring the pure emptiness beyond the world,\nthe true flavor of the Daoist path.\nIn leisurely song and response,\nwhat deep meaning bound our dharma kin!\n\nNow, scattered far apart,\neach with苦志 and diligent heart,\nwe refine ourselves, each escaping collapse.\nSince we drifted apart,\nmeetings have been rare,\nseparated by secluded mountains and distant passes.\nDivided by heaven and earth,\nwe gaze like fading stars at dawn.\nWhen shall we meet

ranks,\na thousand layers of trials to cross.\nWild arrows from mad bows darkened the windows,\nendless in their fall.\nYet through mindful awakening,\nI passed the years,\nunobstructed in the true source.\nWielding the sword of wisdom,\nthe demon horde naturally scattered,\nand I alone displayed mighty power.\n\nMoving in and out of the radiant light of the eight directions,\nmy divine mechanism was unfathomable,\neven heaven’s net could not contain me.\nSweeping clouds, clearing mist, shaking the dharma-realm,\nI left no trace.\nSoaring and transforming,\nI roamed the great void,\nwhere the wind howled in desolation.\nPatrolling the four seas,\nhow many peers shared this journey?\n\n---\n\n**To the Tune of \"The Traveling Merchant Stays\"**\n**On Cultivating the Dao**\n\nMeeting at the four origins,\npassing Mount Hua,\nwe arrived together in the land of Qin.\nSinging and laughing,\nwe subtly revealed the joyous essence of Chongyang.\nThe effortless way

      "translated_text": "**Mocking the Bearded Monk**\n\nNeither monk nor Daoist, nor gentle in demeanor,\nUnashamed before nine hundred souls.\nAwakened nature transcends the dharma-realm in an instant,\nYet this body, through countless kalpas, remains my prison.\nA changed face and altered guise—none can fathom,\nA walking corpse with wandering bones—no cause for my sorrow.\nExultant, I forget form and return to simplicity,\nLet others mock me as unrefined.\n\n**II. Two Poems from Weinan’s Lu Creek**\n\n**I**\nA rare vista fills the river plain,\nWater and bamboo curve to encircle all sides.\nClustered railings bloom with crimson flowers,\nBefore the gate, verdant cypresses sway gently.\nChildren vie in song as spring winds dance,\nSpirited birds contend in skill at dawn’s tree-tops.\nThirty households dwell within the community,\nTheir devotion to the true Dao outshines Pan Stream.\n\n**II**\nA splendid scene renews itself daily,\nAncient cypresses stand dense in four-season spring.\nThis blessed land, lofty and pure, shuns worldly affairs,\nThe sacred altar often hosts immortal guests.\nEach rejoices in being born within the Middle Kingdom,\nEvery household reverently honors the Perfected.\nIf only all gentlemen would awaken,\nTogether ascending the leakless realm beyond the red dust.\n\n**III. Presented to a Daoist Friend**\n\nImmortals drift ethereal in the Great Void’s secrecy,\nThe worldly have no means to glimpse them.\nFortunate to encounter an open gate of teaching,\nWhen fasting and rites arise, do not refuse.\nBurdened by family, one sins all day long,\nYet cultivating fortune and refining the heart lasts but a moment.\nShould carelessness arise when the time comes,\nHow then to repay such boundless kindness?\n\n**IV. Indolence**\n\nToo lazy to read scriptures, too lazy to burn incense,\nStupefied and reeling as if drunk and mad.\nSun and moon know only rise and fall,\nRight and wrong—why discern short from long?\nGuests arrive, yet my heart is too weary to inquire,\nFood reaches my lips, yet my mouth is too sluggish to open.\nNot that I deliberately indulge this body,\nBut poverty and sickness have left me no cure.\n\n**Golden Lotus Emerges from Jade Flower #8: Encountering the Teachings**\n\n**Master Chongyang**\nLong ago at Gan River, I first met him—\nMaster Chongyang, whose heart opened to the Great Dao.\nHe established teachings and journeyed east to the sea,\nTurning back from the ends of the earth,\nHe brought three or four friends from my homeland.\nWhen Wei Guo ascended, it startled a million households in Qin Chuan.\n\n**II. Self-Description**\n\nUnkempt hair, a face caked in grime,\nI disregard this frame’s poverty and lowliness.\nEmbracing simplicity, I nurture the spirit,\nContent and carefree, delighting in true nature.\nThough ice-pure and jade-fair,\nAll must sink into the earth in the end.\nWhether a Zi Yu or Pan An,\nBeneath the springs, all skulls are the same.\n\n**III. For Li Sheng of Famen Temple**\n\nA lump of foul flesh,\nFor ages deluding people, never enough.\nTen thousand kinds of restless thoughts,\nSix paths of ceaseless rising and sinking.\nThe Buddha-nature innate and true,\nHow can it be obscured and not reawakened?\nThe treasure of the immortals’ lineage,\nOnce enlightened, dispels your delusions.\n\n**IV. Summer Drought**\n\nAt the height of heat,\nUnder a lofty sky, timely rains are absent.\nA thousand miles of clear radiance,\nClouds attempt to form but are scattered by the wind.\nHeaven and earth like a furnace,\nAll day long, scorching heat melts the air.\nCreatures languish, people grow weary,\nRecalling last spring’s complaints of too much rain.\n\n**V. South Village of Western Guo**\n\nA land of excellence,\nWinding waters meander through willow-lined paths.\nEverywhere, ponds and embankments,\nLotus flowers press against powdered walls.\nLofty halls and grand mansions,\nEach household like a painted screen.\nTowering peaks and soaring ridges,\nDay by day, clouds descend with auspicious omens.\n\n**VI. Green Peak**\n\nClouds disperse, rain clears,\nRevealing the Green Peak’s cold, bony majesty.\nWilds still, heavens vast,\nIts towering form pierces the azure vault.\nThe southern stream holds no charm,\nWith you, I while away the scorching days.\nAll day I compose poems,\nNot of idle sorrow, but of you alone.\n\n**VII. To Dan Yang on Provoking Demonic Obstacles**\n\nIn Deng, Lai, Wei, and Mi,\nAcross the four seas, all know of the brush behind the ear.\nLoving to argue, never yielding an inch,\nI now walk the Dao,\nUnlike before, no longer calculating gains.\nLet go of strength and weakness,\nFor now, no brush remains behind my head.\n\n**Awakening from Southern Branch #9: Two Poems**\n\n**I. Offering Chrysanthemums at the Lower Prime Festival for Master Qiao**\n\nWhite dew marks the end of autumn’s third month,\nClear frost arrives in the tenth.\nAll flowers wither in desolate decay,\nOnly the Double Ninth’s splendor stands tall.\nResplendent and lovable,\nIts fragrance must not be wasted.\nEveryone adorns their heads with clusters,\nI ask Master Qiao—\nHave you pinned even a single stem?\n\n**II**\nResplendent golden elixir,\nLight and graceful as a white jade branch.\nThe Double Ninth lingers at the Lower Prime,\nOffering rites to the stellar officials,\nSpecially presented to the true master.\nPetitions ascend to the Three Heavens’ Lord,\nVoices reach the Nine Earths’ overseers.\nLife and death, blessings and fortune, are subtly bestowed,\nThe Great Dao’s vast grace,\nAlso entrusted to those who leave the household.\n\n**II. Presented to Pei Manzi**\n\nA boundless world of dust,\nA fluttering, illusory body.\nThe heart within never understands even a moment,\nYet recklessly it rushes,\nStumbling through rugged paths.\nEnticed, the inner elixir is ruined,\nWorn thin, the inner organs grow hollow.\nSorrow, calamity, and suffering entwine,\nA hundred remedies, a thousand methods—\nNone can cure.\n\n**Refining Cinnabar #10: Presented to Zhou Daoquan of Western Guo**\n\nAbide by your lot, do not force ambition.\nPass the days in leisure,\nContent with heaven’s decree, enduring solitude.",
