  "full_translation": "*The Explication of the Perfect Scripture of the Utterly Empty and Supreme Virtue*\n\n**Title:** *Explication of the Perfect Scripture of the Utterly Empty and Supreme Virtue*. Composed by Jiang Yu of the Song dynasty. Twenty fascicles. Base text from the *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Wondrous Writings* section, *Jade Instructions* category. (An alternate version in the *Complete Library of the Four Treasuries* comprises eight fascicles.)\n\n**Fascicle One of the Explication of the Perfect Scripture of the Utterly Empty and Supreme Virtue**\nSubmitted by your subject Jiang Yu, Inner College Student of Hangzhou Prefecture, Song dynasty\n\n**Heavenly Signs**\nMaster Liezi dwelt in the gardens of Zheng for forty years, yet no one knew him.\n\n**Explication:** Master Liezi was a man of antiquity skilled in the Way of the scholar. Subtle, wondrous, and profoundly penetrating, his depths were unfathomable. Thus, though he dwelt in the gardens of Zheng for forty years, none knew him. The gardens and marshes teemed with worthies, yet after forty years without recognition, one perceives the profundity of his reclusion—what the *Book of Changes* calls \"withdrawing into concealment.\" Even the lord of the state and his ministers regarded him as one of the common folk.\n\n**Explication:** Those whose virtue suffices to govern a state and whose Way suffices to nurture the people ought to toil in the search for worthies. Those whose wisdom suffices to lead the multitude ought to be wise enough to know men. That the lord of the state and his ministers dismissed him as one of the common folk—this is why he was so profoundly unknowable.\n\nWhen the state was impoverished, he prepared to take refuge in Wei.\n\n**Explication:** \"The state was impoverished\" refers to a year of famine. Those who study Liezi suppose that because he could ride the wind, he must have abstained from the five grains and subsisted on wind and dew. Little do they know that once one enters the human world, one cannot escape the afflictions of human existence. Thus, the text begins with this to instruct later scholars to seek the Way rather than pursue the bizarre to shock the vulgar. The *Sayings Aligned* also states: \"Master Liezi’s appearance was that of one in poverty, his countenance that of one suffering hunger.\"\n\nHis disciples said: \"Master, you depart without a set time for return. Your disciples dare to make a request—what teaching will you leave us?\"\n\n\"Have you not heard the words of Master Huqiu Zilin?\"\n\n**Explication:** One who embodies emptiness as his substance and the Mean as his Way, who encompasses the myriad things—this is Master Huqiu Zilin, and thus he was Master Liezi’s teacher.\n\nMaster Liezi laughed and said: \"What did Master Hu say? Nevertheless, he once spoke to Bohun Maoren. I overheard it in passing—let me tell it to you.\"\n\n**Explication:** Master Liezi’s teacher, Master Hu, exchanged smiles with him, their hearts in perfect accord. As for Bohun Maoren, though advanced in years, his clarity had waned, so Master Hu, out of necessity, spoke to him, and Master Liezi overheard it. As *Zhuangzi* says: \"To know and not speak is the way to reach Heaven.\" Such was Master Liezi’s relationship with Master Hu. It also says: \"To know and to speak is the way to reach man.\" This is why Master Hu spoke thus to Bohun Maoren.\n\nHis words were: \"There is that which is born yet not born; there is that which transforms yet not transforms. That which is not born can give birth to birth; that which does not transform can give rise to transformation. That which is born cannot but be born; that which transforms cannot but transform.\"\n\n**Explication:** The spirit of Heaven, the abundance of Earth, the reason sages are sages, the reason things are things—these can be summed up in a single word: birth and transformation. Thus, the *Heavenly Signs* begins by clarifying this.\n\nThe forms of bodies are distinct, shifting and passing without cease—this is what is meant by \"there is birth and transformation.\" The Great Simplicity before any sign, the true and constant that does not change—this is what is meant by \"not born and not transformed.\" Confined to what is born, one rushes toward transformation—how can one give birth to birth? Enslaved to what transforms, one ultimately perishes—how can one give rise to transformation? That which is born undergoes transformation—what does that which is not born have to do with transformation? That which transforms ultimately ceases—yet that which does not transform never had arising or ceasing.\n\nThe teeming births are all manifestations of the true heart—this is what is meant by \"can give birth to birth.\" The bustling changes are all issuances of the wondrous heart—this is what is meant by \"can give rise to transformation.\" Once there is birth, one cannot but be born. Once there is transformation, one cannot but transform. Though Heaven and Earth are vast, and the sun and moon bright, once confined to the realm of birth and transformation, they are like a mechanism that cannot stop itself, or a turning that cannot cease. The seasons change and the years pass, unending through all time—how much more so for the myriad things?\n\nThat which is born cannot but be born, so that which gives birth to birth also cannot but give birth to birth. That which transforms cannot but transform, so that which gives rise to transformation also cannot but give rise to transformation. The giving of birth to birth and the giving rise to transformation have no end. Now birth, now transformation—no one knows their limit. This is how Heaven and Earth contain the myriad things without exhaustion, and how the Way contains Heaven and Earth without end.\n\nNevertheless, what is called \"not born and not transformed\" cannot initially be named. Because there is form, we force a name upon it. Thus, beyond that which is born and transformed, there is not another that is not born and not transformed. Rather, the wonder of not being born and not transformed resides within birth and transformation. Therefore, his words say: \"There is that which is born yet not born; there is that which transforms yet not transforms.\" This means that what is born has never truly been born, and what transforms has never truly transformed. Yet that by which there is birth and transformation is neither external nor internal—it simply gives birth to itself and transforms itself.\n\nObserving that he first speaks of \"that which is born yet not born\" and \"that which transforms yet not transforms,\" he has already exhausted the Way. Of necessity, he clarifies the principle of giving birth to birth and giving rise to transformation, which ultimately must return to self-birth and self-transformation. As for dwelling in the realm of birth and transformation yet following its course, or being within birth and transformation yet not controlled by them—then the birth of the myriad things is the true substance of my heart, and the transformation of the myriad things is the wondrous function of my heart. This is why sages are sages, and the purport of Master Liezi’s teachings.\n\nThus, there is constant birth and constant transformation. \"Constant birth and constant transformation\" means there is no time without birth, no time without transformation.\n\nA commentary states: What is called \"constant birth and constant transformation\" speaks of the supreme principle of creation and transformation across all things, past and present. Observing even a single thing, it is born through transformation and dies through transformation. If we take the temporary aggregation of qi as birth, then it cannot be called \"constant birth\"; if we take the passing away of form as transformation, then it cannot be called \"constant transformation.\" For in creation and transformation’s relation to the myriad things, as soon as something is born, its transformation does not cease; even after it dies, its transformation continues unabated. Transformation is indeed constant, and birth is likewise uninterrupted. If we were to imagine a single thing within creation and transformation, its birth and transformation occurring in the space of a hair’s breadth, then the principle of birth and transformation would nearly be extinguished.\n\nIt has been said that the life and death of things are like the day and night of the sun: the sun’s rising makes day, its setting makes night. How can day be called \"birth\" or night be called \"extinction\"? This is what is meant by \"no time without birth, no time without transformation.\" The first chapter of the *Daoist Classic* of Lord Lao speaks of the constant Dao, constant names, constant non-being, and constant being. If discourse on the Dao does not reach constancy, it is insufficient to serve as the gate of all wonders.\n\nIt is but yin and yang, but the four seasons. A commentary states: Yin and yang unfold into the four seasons. All that belongs to the realm of the living cannot but follow their revolutions, yet the Dao disperses into yin and yang, and its birth and transformation are merely lodged in the realm of form. The wonder of constant birth and constant transformation is not to be seen in these alone. To say \"it is but yin and yang, but the four seasons\" is to belittle it.\n\nThat which does not birth is the solitary mystery; that which does not transform is the cycle of return. Its boundary cannot be exhausted; the solitary mystery—its Dao cannot be fathomed. A commentary states: Only the solitary can pair and respond, becoming the source to which all movement belongs. This is what the myriad things depend upon and what all transformation awaits. Yet the Dao does not pair with things; things pair with the Dao themselves. What Lord Lao called \"seeming to be the ancestor of the myriad things\" is what is here called the solitary mystery. \"Cycle of return\" refers to the endless thread. That its boundary cannot be exhausted and its Dao cannot be fathomed is why there is constant birth and constant transformation.\n\nThe *Book of the Yellow Emperor* says: \"The valley spirit does not die; it is called the mysterious female. The gate of the mysterious female is called the root of heaven and earth. It flows continuously, as if existing; its use is never exhausted.\" A commentary states: The valley is empty yet responsive, responding without storing. Human life arises as the vital qi circulates through the body, entering and exiting through the nose and mouth—this is the image of the valley. What is called the \"valley spirit\" is the spirit of the valley, signifying attainment of the One, its numinous wonder beyond measure. \"The valley spirit does not die\" is the Dao of long life and enduring vision. To call it \"does not die\" is because all living kinds receive their mandate from creation and transformation and are enslaved by yin and yang. In their birth, they cannot but be born; in their death, they cannot but die. Only humans, as the most numinous of the myriad things, though they share with all things a mandate from creation and transformation to be born, once born, possess what creation and transformation cannot cause to die. For we share a single qi with heaven and earth and govern ourselves, guarding our original root. Thus, our mandate lies within us, not with heaven and earth. If one can constantly preserve the valley spirit, then one’s breath reaches the heels, the harmonious qi pervades the body, and there are those who cultivate the body for twelve hundred years without their form ever declining. Though they have life, they enter into a state beyond death and birth, enduring together with the Dao. Therefore, speaking of the valley spirit, it is not called \"life\" but \"does not die.\"\n\n\"Mysterious\" is the color of heaven. \"Female\" is the kind of earth. Flying creatures are called male and female; walking creatures are called female and male. The female is the utmost yin yet possesses the power of ceaseless generation. In the realm beyond form, yin precedes yang, which is why it is metaphorically ascribed to this generative power of things. The ceaseless generation of the valley spirit is called the mysterious female. For the wonder of the valley spirit, when applied to the body, gives birth to the body; when extended to others, gives birth to others. If one can constantly preserve this spirit, how could its generation ever be exhausted? Its essential wonder is such that nothing but the mysterious female could name it.\n\nThe \"gate\" refers to the coming and going, the entry and exit. It speaks of the valley spirit within me, whose coming and going, entry and exit, leave no gap. If one can constantly live without dying, then the waxing and waning, the filling and emptying of the single body are not controlled by creation and transformation, and creation and transformation lie within me. That heaven and earth can be long and enduring is fundamentally due to this Dao. Thus it is said: \"The gate of the mysterious female is called the root of heaven and earth.\" \"Flowing continuously, as if existing\" describes the substance of the valley spirit. \"Its use is never exhausted\" describes the Dao of preserving the spirit.\n\n\"Flowing continuously\" speaks of weakness without cessation. A single breath’s coming and going within the body may be called weak, yet to constantly live without dying is to be without cessation. Only by flowing continuously can it seem to exist yet be neither being nor non-being. \"Its use is never exhausted\" is what Mencius meant by \"nourishing appropriately without harm.\" As for this qi, it cannot be abandoned and left unused, nor can its use be forced. Not to use it is like the man of Song who did not weed his seedlings; to use it with force is like the man of Song who pulled up his seedlings. Only by using it without force and yet filling all between heaven and earth can the valley spirit not die.\n\nThe *Transmission of the Dao* says: \"The Great Simplicity is transmitted as the Dao’s words of vast emptiness shining within the scene.\" This is what Lord Lao called the valley spirit. If the valley spirit is thus, it is how the root of birth and death is extinguished and one constantly lives without dying. Therefore, that which gives birth to things does not itself birth; that which transforms things does not itself transform. It births itself and transforms itself, forms itself and colors itself, knows itself and empowers itself, dissolves itself and rests itself. To call these \"birth and transformation,\" \"form and color,\" \"knowledge and power,\" \"dissolution and rest\" is incorrect.\n\nA commentary states: Following the statement that \"the valley spirit does not die,\" this is said: if one can preserve the valley spirit, then within the birth and transformation of one’s own body there is the wonder of neither birth nor transformation, no longer requiring the process of birth giving birth and transformation giving transformation. This is self-birth and self-transformation.\n\nFrom the self-birth and self-transformation of one’s own body, one knows that all things likewise self-birth and self-transform. Tracing the Dao of birth and transformation to its origin, it is fundamentally rooted in spontaneity. To call it \"birth giving birth and transformation giving transformation\" is to posit a duality of birth and transformation. To regard it as self-birth and self-transformation seems to imply no external dependence, yet this still falls within the realm of discourse. For the Dao of birth and transformation transcends speech and defies designation. To call it \"birth and transformation\" is already far removed from the Dao; only when one recognizes that even this designation is inadequate does one approach the ultimate truth.\n\nMoreover, the transformations of the myriad things are inexhaustible, yet all are but instances of birth and transformation. When distinguished in detail, they exhibit differences in form, color, knowledge, power, dissolution, and rest. This specificity is articulated to illustrate how the Dao’s abundance suffices for all things, leaving nothing, however small, unaccounted for.\n\nLiezi said: \"Of old, the sages followed yin and yang to unify Heaven and Earth.\" A commentary states: To speak of the birth and transformation of the myriad things is necessarily to trace them to yin and yang. Yet the unfolding of yin and yang is confined within Heaven and Earth. To fathom the creative transformations of Heaven and Earth is to recognize their unity in the sage. Though Heaven and Earth are vast, they do not transcend form and thus cannot be independent of what unifies them. The sage, though but one instance of what is unified, cannot unify Heaven and Earth without relying on their inherent principles. In unifying them, the sage cannot but follow the proper balance of yin and yang.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven and Earth originally requires no external dependence and cannot be unified. Yet the transformations of Heaven and Earth, though necessarily rooted in yin and yang, cannot be without dependence, and thus the sage is able to unify them by following their inherent principles. By aligning with yin and yang without contravening the natural tendencies of things, each thing attains its proper Dao and rectifies its nature and destiny.\n\nAll things submit to the mandate of creation, yet only through the sage do they each rectify their nature and destiny. If creation merely follows the sage rather than unifying Heaven and Earth, what else could unify them? This is to say, when one is raised, the other follows.\n\nTaking the body as an example: the head and feet correspond to Heaven and Earth, while breath resembles yin and yang. By nurturing with uprightness and without harm, the qi of the body becomes vast and fills the space between Heaven and Earth. If one does not nurture it, the qi runs wild and disturbs the heart. If one nurtures it without uprightness, it becomes an inauspicious excess of life. Thus, unifying the body must be rooted in one’s own upright nurturing, just as unifying Heaven and Earth depends on the sage’s alignment with yin and yang.\n\nThough the creative transformations of Heaven and Earth remain unchanged from ancient times to the present, when the sage governs above, yin and yang are harmonized, sun and moon shine brightly, and governance brings peace and prosperity. Thus, the divine archer caused things to be free from blight, and the harvests ripened. When the Yellow Emperor sought the essence of Heaven and Earth to aid the five grains, was there any other Dao? It was simply a matter of following yin and yang.\n\nAlas, in their birth, all humans are shaped by Heaven and Earth and receive qi from yin and yang. Even the sage differs from others in no fundamental way. Yin and yang may control us, yet the sage can follow them. Heaven and Earth may give us life, yet the sage can unify them. Thus, it is no exaggeration to say that the sage’s husk and chaff suffice to mold a Yao or Shun.\n\nThat which has form arises from the formless—then from whence do Heaven and Earth arise? Therefore, it is said: There is the Supreme Simplicity, the Supreme Beginning, the Supreme Origin, and the Supreme Plainness.\n\nA commentary states: The luminous arises from the obscure, the ordered from the formless. All things are the transformations of Heaven and Earth. Yet Heaven and Earth, though capable of generating the myriad things, have not transcended form. Having form, they cannot arise from nothing. If they too have an origin, from whence do they arise? If their origin is unknown, to say that the formed arises from the formless is also unconvincing.\n\nHeaven and Earth are the greatest of the formed, yet their origins are unfathomable. One cannot say they arise from nothing, nor can one perceive their source. Yet by investigating the principle of birth within one’s own body, one realizes that Heaven and Earth are born alongside oneself—what then remains unknowable?\n\nHowever, the formless of the Supreme Beginning cannot be discussed in words. What can be spoken of is only that which exists yet remains unformed. Thus, from the Supreme Simplicity onward, their sequence is clarified.\n\nWhat, then, are the Supreme Simplicity, the Supreme Beginning, the Supreme Origin, and the Supreme Plainness? They are but provisional names assigned to the stages by which the Dao emerges from non-being into being, likened to forms and given forced designations.\n\nThe Supreme Simplicity is the state before qi is manifest. The Supreme Beginning is the inception of qi. The Supreme Origin is the inception of form. The Supreme Plainness is the inception of substance. When qi, form, and substance are present yet undifferentiated, this is called \"primordial chaos.\" Primordial chaos describes the state in which the myriad things are intermingled and undivided. It cannot be seen, heard, or grasped—hence it is called \"Simplicity.\" Simplicity has no boundaries of form.\n\nA commentary states: \"Supreme\" is an emphatic expression of greatness. As forms and names descend, they are inadequate to describe its magnitude, so it is called \"Supreme.\" \"Simplicity\" denotes inexhaustible transformation. Thus, the state before qi is manifest is named the Supreme Simplicity. All things share the Supreme Beginning, after which each has its own beginning. Once there is a beginning but no form, the inception of qi is called the Supreme Beginning.\n\nAll things take shape in Heaven and form on Earth. The character for \"beginning\" (*shi*) is composed of \"woman\" (*nü*) and \"platform\" (*tai*), suggesting gestation. Gestation is the inception of form, so the inception of form is called the Supreme Origin. As for \"plainness\" (*su*), it refers to color before it is dyed. Though it can be called plain, color has not yet manifested, so it is named the Supreme Plainness, denoting the inception of substance.\n\nThough the inception of qi, form, and substance is complete, their sequence may be inferred, yet the Dao remains undivided. As Heaven, as Earth, as sages, as creatures—all share in uncarved simplicity and have not yet departed from it, this is called the Primal Chaos.\n\nForms upon forms, yet nothing exists—how can one see and trace sound? Sounds without hearing—how can one listen and know? Nevertheless, since the inception of qi, form, and substance is already complete, it has departed far from the Supreme Simplicity. Yet it remains in a state of chaos, not yet separated from simplicity, so though it cannot be named Supreme Simplicity, it is still called simplicity.\n\nSimplicity transforms into the One, the One transforms into the Seven, the Seven transforms into the Nine. The Nine is the ultimate transformation, which then reverts to the One.\n\nExplanation: The One is the generative number of water. The Seven is the consummate number of fire. Once essence and spirit are complete, fire ascends and water descends, Kan and Li intermingle, and the myriad transformations thereby manifest. The Seven further transforms into the Nine, and the transformations of the myriad things are exhausted. Nine is the ultimate number of Heaven; when it reaches its limit, it transforms, thus reverting to the One. The changes of numbers are inexhaustible, like a ring without end—this is the supreme principle of Heaven and Earth’s creative transformation.\n\nRegarding water, we speak of its generative number; regarding fire, its consummate number. Water is the phase of things’ generation; fire, the phase of things’ flourishing. Moreover, the generative number of fire is the secondary Two, for the Two cannot transform.\n\nThe *Virtue Classic* of the Old Master says: “The One gives birth to the Two, the Two gives birth to the Three, and the Three gives birth to the myriad things.” This speaks of water as the One and fire as the secondary Two, essence being complete and spirit following. Heaven begins with the One in the North, Earth pairs with the Two in the South, and humans attain position in the Three. Once the Three Powers are complete, the myriad images are distinguished.\n\nThe Old Master speaks of the generation of things; Liezi speaks of the transformation of things. Though their numbers differ, all begin with the One and rely on the functions of water and fire. From this, we know that the teachings of the sages emerge and return as one, mutually illuminating the Dao.\n\nThe One is the inception of form’s transformation.\n\nExplanation: As a number, the One has departed from the Dao yet is not yet paired with things, so the One is the inception of form’s transformation. Heaven’s One generates water, the abode of essence. Human life begins with Heaven’s One residing in the viscera, establishing the root and inception. The transformation and generation of the myriad things all originate from Heaven and Earth containing essence—this is why the One is the inception of form’s transformation. *Zhuangzi* says that when one is in accord with the One, all affairs are complete—is this not because one has grasped the inception of form’s transformation?\n\nThe pure and light ascend to become Heaven; the turbid and heavy descend to become Earth; the harmonious qi becomes humans. Thus, Heaven and Earth contain essence, and the myriad things transform and generate.\n\nExplanation: Heaven attains the One and accumulates qi, so it is pure and light, covering all things. Earth attains the One and accumulates mass, so it is turbid and heavy, bearing all things. The solemn emerges from Heaven, the radiant issues from Earth—when the two intermingle, they form harmony, and the harmonious qi becomes humans. The transformation and generation of the myriad things all depend on attaining the One, yet cannot be without reliance on the ceaseless process of generation and transformation. Thus, only after Heaven and Earth contain essence do the myriad things transform and generate. It is not called “generation and transformation” but “transformation and generation,” for what has ended returns to generation, expressing the inexhaustibility of generation and transformation.\n\nOf humans and things, all receive the harmony of yin and yang to complete their lives and bear their forms. Yet it is specifically said that the harmonious qi becomes humans because, though all share in life, the generation of the myriad things includes distinctions of flying and burrowing, moving and still, feathered and scaled, shelled and bare—each inevitably leans toward yin or yang. Only humans embody the harmonious qi.\n\nMaster Liezi said: “Heaven and Earth have no complete functions, sages have no complete abilities, and the myriad things have no complete uses.” Thus, Heaven’s duty is to generate and cover, Earth’s duty is to shape and bear, the sage’s duty is to teach and transform, and things’ duty is to fulfill what is fitting.\n\nYet Heaven has its shortcomings, Earth has its strengths, sages have their limitations, and things have their capacities. Why? What generates and covers cannot shape and bear; what shapes and bears cannot teach and transform; what teaches and transforms cannot defy what is fitting; and what is fittingly determined does not depart from its position.\n\nThus, the Dao of Heaven and Earth is either yin or yang; the teachings of sages are either benevolence or righteousness; the fittingness of the myriad things is either soft or hard. All follow what is fitting and cannot depart from their positions.\n\nExplanation: Discussing the Dao of Heaven, Earth, and sages, there is nothing not encompassed, nothing not pervaded. Yet speaking of the functions of Heaven, Earth, and sages, they have already descended to their roots and flowed to their branches, confined within the realm of form’s transformation, each having its own duty. Thus, Heaven can act as Heaven but not as Earth; Earth can act as Earth but not as Heaven. Sages should be all-encompassing yet have their limitations; things have their limitations yet also their capacities.\n\nIf one seeks the Dao of Heaven through yin and yang, the sun of a thousand years may be attained while seated. If one seeks the teachings of sages through benevolence and righteousness, the achievements of emperors and kings may be discussed with reverence. If one seeks the myriad things through softness and hardness, the countless changes may be enumerated one by one. For once something is bound to form, it cannot depart from its fittingly determined position.\n\nNevertheless, without defying what is fitting, even the subtlest of the myriad things has its wondrous use. To seek perfection is to deny Heaven and Earth’s greatness of having no complete functions. If one can constantly abide in one’s fittingly determined position without opposing one’s natural nature, then every thing will share in the same function as Heaven and Earth. Though the myriad changes differ, all will be harmonized under a single governance.\n\nThus, there are those that generate, and those that generate generation; those that take form, and those that form forms; those that produce sound, and those that sound sounds; those that bear color, and those that color colors; those that have flavor, and those that flavor flavors.\n\nWhat is generated by generation perishes, yet that which generates generation never ends. What is formed by forms is substantial, yet that which forms forms never exists. What is sounded by sounds is heard, yet that which sounds sounds never emits.\n\nWhat is colored by colors is manifest, yet that which colors colors never appears. What is flavored by flavors is tasted, yet that which flavors flavors never presents itself.\n\nThe explanation states: The Classic says: \"There is no absence without presence, no presence without absence.\" Now, what is called presence and absence does not take presence as presence, nor absence as absence. From non-presence arises presence, from non-absence arises absence—presence is thus absence, absence is thus presence. Hence, there are those that generate, and those that generate generation. Not generation, yet there is presence; not generating generation, yet there is absence. What is generated does not depart from generating generation, and generating generation does not lie beyond what is generated. Its presence is not presence, its absence is not absence. Forms, sounds, colors, and flavors are no different.\n\nThus, without the presence of forms, colors, sounds, and flavors, the transformations of absence would not be revealed. Without the presence of generating generation, forming forms, sounding sounds, coloring colors, and flavoring flavors, the operations of presence would not proceed. Therefore, what is generated cannot be called subtle, nor can generating generation be called wondrous. Though forms, sounds, colors, and flavors are the coarsest of things, their continuity from beginning to end ensures their generation is inexhaustible, and their provision to humanity is unceasing.\n\nMoreover, forms, colors, sounds, and flavors are of one body, sufficiently encompassing all, yet they are repeatedly spoken of because the generation of the myriad things is often partial to sounds, colors, scents, and flavors. This is stated to clarify that all living kinds—whether sentient or insentient—operate under the office of non-action. All are the office of non-action.\n\nThey can be yin, they can be yang; they can be soft, they can be hard; they can be short, they can be long; they can be round, they can be square; they can generate life, they can bring death; they can be hot, they can be cool; they can float, they can sink; they can be *gong*, they can be *shang*; they can emerge, they can submerge; they can be dark, they can be yellow; they can be sweet, they can be bitter; they can be rank, they can be fragrant. They have no knowledge, yet nothing is unknown to them; they have no ability, yet nothing is beyond their capacity.\n\nThe explanation states: The Dao constantly practices non-action, yet nothing is left undone. The office of non-action is the master of the myriad transformations, what *Zhuangzi* calls the \"true sovereign.\" Only through non-action is one unbound by yin and yang, unrestrained by softness and hardness, neither square nor form-bound, neither dead nor alive, untethered to time, unattached to things, unconfined to sounds and colors, ungoverned by scents and flavors. It issues forth qi and things, envelops forms and spirits, and all things rely on its function, yet I never depart from it—hence, nothing is unknown, nothing is beyond its capacity. As Lord Lao said, \"Its function cannot be exhausted.\" Therefore, those who govern transformation must root themselves in non-action.\n\nWhen Master Liezi traveled to Wei, he ate by the roadside. His followers saw a century-old skull, plucked some mugwort, and pointed at it, turning to his disciple Bai Feng to say: \"Only you and that one know that you have never been born and never died. Is this not surpassing nourishment? Is this not surpassing joy?\"\n\nThe manifold transformations of species are as follows:\n\nWhen a frog becomes a quail, it may turn into *ji* upon encountering water; at the border of water and earth, it becomes the raiment of frogs and toads. Born on mounds, it becomes *lingxi*. *Lingxi* meeting *yuqi* becomes *wuzu*. The root of *wuzu* becomes *qichan*, while its leaves become butterflies. Butterflies, in their multitude, transform into insects, born beneath the stove, their form like a cast-off skin, named *niaogouduo*. After a thousand days, *niaogouduo* transforms into a bird called *ganyugu*. The foam of *ganyugu* becomes *simi*. *Simi* becomes *shixiyilu*, and *shixiyilu* gives rise to *shixihuanghuang*. *Shixihuanghuang* generates *jiuyou*, *jiuyou* generates *maorui*, and *maorui* arises from *fuxuan*.\n\nSheep’s liver transforms into *digao*; horse’s blood into *zhaolin*; human blood into wildfire. The sparrow hawk becomes the goshawk, the goshawk becomes the cuckoo, and the cuckoo in time reverts to the sparrow hawk. Swallows become clams; field mice become quails; rotten melons become fish; old leeks become amaranth; aged rams become apes; and fish roe becomes insects.\n\nThe beast *danyuan* conceives of itself and is called *lei*. The bird of rivers and marshes is born from gazing and is called *yi*. A purely female creature is named *dayao*; a purely male one, *zhifeng*. A longing scholar, though unwed, may be moved to conception; a yearning maiden, though husbandless, may become pregnant. Hou Ji was born from a giant’s footprint; Yi Yin from the hollow mulberry; Jue Zhao from dampness; and vinegar flies from wine.\n\nWhen *yangxi* pairs with the non-sprouting bamboo, old bamboo gives rise to *qingning*. *Qingning* generates *cheng*, *cheng* generates horses, horses generate humans, and humans in time enter the mechanism. All things emerge from the mechanism and all things return to the mechanism.\n\n**Explanation:**\nThough a skull may lie for a hundred years, its wandering soul may pass into another form, becoming human again for another century before death. If it transforms into other beings, its deaths and rebirths would be beyond counting. Even as an empty skull, its form remains, and the transformations of its wandering soul are already manifold. Liezi alone grasped the marvel of his own body, and since the skull had undergone a century of changes, he pointed to it and said: \"Only you and that one know that you have never died and never been born.\" Thus, Liezi, drawing on what he had seen and heard, questioned the century-old skull to illustrate the transformations of all things.\n\nThe arising of the myriad beings may stem from emotion or from thought. Those born from dampness arise through union and resonance; those formed through transformation respond through separation. Emotion and thought, union and separation, alternate and shift. Some, through sentience, transform into the insentient—like the frog becoming *lingxi*; others, through insentience, transform into the sentient—like *maorui* arising from *fuxuan*. Some grow from small to large, others from large to small. The swallow becomes a clam, and the flying creature sinks; the mouse becomes a quail, and the walking creature takes flight. Some transform by mutual gaze, like the birds of rivers and marshes; others conceive of themselves, like the beasts *zhan* and *yuan*. A single species may undergo diverse transformations—like *wuzu* becoming *qichan* or butterflies, or the frog becoming *ji*, the raiment of frogs and toads, or *lingxi*—so varied are its changes. Among these, Hou Ji’s birth from a giant’s footprint stands as a particularly extraordinary transformation, as recorded in the *Book of Songs* and thus verifiable.\n\nIn essence, whether sentient or insentient, large or small, all things emerge from and return to the mechanism, equally abiding in the supreme principle, none able to alter it. What, then, is this \"mechanism\"? How do the myriad things emerge from and return to it?\n\nThe *Plain Questions* states: \"When exit and entry cease, the spiritual mechanism of transformation perishes.\" For the success and failure of all things depend on movement; movement unceasing gives rise to change. Thus, without exit and entry, there would be no birth, growth, maturity, or aging. Though exit and entry differ, the mechanism remains one; though their paths diverge, the mechanism is wondrous. The mechanism is revealed through exit and entry, and exit and entry operate by virtue of the mechanism. One cannot say that exit and entry *are* the mechanism, nor can one seek the mechanism apart from exit and entry. With each exit and entry, the spiritual mechanism silently operates.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* deems the knower of the mechanism \"spiritual\"—is this not the intent? The *Book of the Yellow Emperor* says: \"Heavenly nature is human; the human heart is the mechanism.\" This text speaks of all things emerging from and returning to the mechanism, yet it particularly notes that \"humans in time enter the mechanism\"—is this not because humans are the most spiritually endowed of all beings, and thus cited to encompass all?\n\n*Explication of the Perfect Dao of Profound Virtue*, Scroll One\n*Explication of the Perfect Dao of Profound Virtue*, Scroll Two\nPresented by Jiang Yue, Inner Student of the Hangzhou Prefecture School, Song Dynasty\n\nThe *Book of the Yellow Emperor* states: \"When form moves, it does not generate form but generates shadow; when sound moves, it does not generate sound but generates echo; when non-being moves, it does not generate non-being but generates being.\" The explication says: Abiding in stillness without movement, one observes the subtlety of constant non-being and the boundary of constant being. Observing both boundary and subtlety, one sees they do not intersect. Yet when stirred by response, non-being cannot remain so. Constant non-being must enter into being, and being cannot remain constant, for it must return to non-being—such is the natural movement, which none can resist.\n\nThough form and sound are not entirely absent in their reflections, when they rest in yin to cease their echoes, over time their sounds fade, and they too must ultimately return to nothingness. Since non-being cannot be spoken of as generating, the text speaks of form, sound, and their reflections to illustrate non-being.\n\n*Zhuangzi* says: \"All things generate one another through form.\" Here, however, it is said that form does not generate form. Though forms generate one another, in truth, form cannot generate itself. There is that which generates life, and it arises from non-being. Form is necessarily finite—does heaven and earth also end? They end together with me. Do they advance beyond ending? One cannot know. The Dao ends in what originally had no beginning and advances in what originally had no duration.\n\nThe explication says: That which exists must come to an end, so what has form must perish. Heaven, earth, and I are equally confined by form. Once it is clear how they arise, one should also know whether they end. Those who embody the Dao say that heaven, earth, and I are born together, so their end must also coincide with mine. Do they advance beyond ending? One cannot know—this is to say, there has never been an end. Since heaven, earth, and I do not depart from form, the discussion stops at \"one cannot know.\" As for the Dao, it departs from form and generation, having neither beginning nor end. Beginning and end are correlatives—if the Dao originally had no beginning, how can one perceive its end? Duration and proximity are correlatives—if the Dao originally had no duration, how can one perceive its limit?\n\nThat which is born must return to non-birth; that which has form must return to formlessness. The non-born is not originally non-born; the formless is not originally formless. The born is that which by principle must end. The ending cannot but end, just as the born cannot but be born. Yet to desire only its birth and exhaust its end is to be deluded by fate.\n\nThe explication says: That which is originally non-born has no arising or ceasing; that which is originally formless has no gathering or dispersing. Once there is birth, there must be a return to non-birth; once there is form, there must be a return to formlessness. Waxing and waning, fullness and emptiness—these are the natural patterns. In life, fate arises and one cannot but be born; in death, fate is exhausted and one cannot but end. The coming and going of life and death do not depend on me. The deluded, however, cling to the body of conditioned phenomena, seeking long life without death—this is to fail to recognize the principle of inevitability.\n\nSpirit belongs to heaven’s portion; bones and flesh belong to earth’s portion. That which belongs to heaven is clear and disperses; that which belongs to earth is turbid and gathers. When spirit departs from form, each returns to its true nature—hence it is called *gui* (ghost). *Gui* means \"return,\" returning to its true abode.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said: \"When spirit enters its gate and bones return to their root, what of me remains?\" The explication says: In human life, the hundred bones, nine orifices, and six viscera are all present, temporarily gathered by qi—this is not originally my body. The clear and light belong to heaven; the turbid and heavy belong to earth. At life’s end, spirit departs from form, warmth disperses, movement ceases, the clear returns to heaven, the turbid returns to earth, each returning to its true nature. What is called \"I\"—what remains of it? The value of the Dao in mastering death lies in the moment when all things return to their true nature without losing one’s self. If one does not lose what abides in oneself at this moment, then life is governed by oneself, and the transformations of creation cannot cause one to sink.\n\nConfucius said: \"If one hears the Dao in the morning, one may die in the evening.\" Mencius said: \"Neither long life nor early death sways one’s resolve.\" Yan Hui said: \"I have forgotten myself in sitting.\" All refer to this Dao.\n\nFrom birth to death, the great transformations of life have four stages: infancy, youth and prime, old age, and death. In infancy, qi is concentrated and the will is unified—this is the height of harmony. Things do not harm it, and virtue cannot surpass it. In youth and prime, blood and qi overflow, desires and thoughts arise abundantly—things assail it, and virtue thus declines. In old age, desires and thoughts soften, the body prepares to rest—things do not precede it. Though it does not attain the wholeness of infancy, it surpasses youth and prime. In death, one comes to rest, returning to the ultimate.\n\nThe explication says: Human life belongs to the transformations of creation, ever renewing without cease, thoughts shifting moment by moment. Taking its broad outline, there are four stages. Their sequence is natural, neither increased nor diminished by nobility or baseness. Examining virtue and form, inner and outer do not correspond. In human life, the flourishing and decline of virtue rise and fall with the body—what is the principle behind this?\n\nHuman life is the gathering of qi. Qi is concentrated in infancy, overflows in youth and prime, rests in old age, and ceases in death. If one cannot preserve one’s self and the will is insufficient to command qi, how little remains within that is not swept away by things? In life, one is merely enslaved by transformation; in death, one is merely altered by it—one knows not when this will end. Only those who embody the Dao can transform things without being transformed by them. Though they follow the changes of transformation, they do not drift with creation’s flow. In infancy, they share the same concentration with others. As for youth, prime, and old age, they never lose the heart of a newborn child.\n\nThough death comes, it is precisely the means by which one attains the constant joy of quiescence—this is what is called \"in exhalation returning to the utmost.\"\n\nConfucius once traveled to Mount Tai and saw Rong Qiqi walking in the wilds of Cheng, clad in a deerskin robe tied with a rope, playing the zither and singing. Confucius asked him, \"Sir, what is the source of your joy?\" He replied, \"My joys are many. Heaven gives birth to the myriad things, and only humans are noble—yet I have been born a human: this is my first joy. Among men and women, men are honored while women are lowly, and thus men are noble—I have been born a man: this is my second joy. Some in life never see the sun or moon, never leave their swaddling clothes; I have already lived to ninety years: this is my third joy. Poverty is the constant lot of the scholar; death is the end of all people. Abiding in constancy and meeting one’s end—what is there to grieve?\" Confucius said, \"Excellent! He is one who can console himself.\"\n\nAn explanation: The name Rong Qiqi—*rong* suggests blossoming without fruition, *qi* suggests openness to engagement. He grasps the flourishing splendor of the Dao, his form open to interacting with things, and seeks only the joy of following life’s course, without delving into the Dao’s deep-rooted foundation. This is why he finds contentment in constancy and takes joy in his end.\n\nYet what is truly prized in the Dao is not merely the solitary joy of life—it is the means by which one perfects one’s death. Though such a person does not drown in the path of profit and harm, nor meet an untimely end midway, he is still distinct from the common crowd. As for his attainment of the Dao—it has not yet come to pass. This is what is called \"consoling oneself to find joy,\" not the true joy that knows no lack of joy.\n\nLin Lei was nearly a hundred years old. In late spring, he donned a fur robe, gleaned stray grains from old fields, and sang as he walked. Confucius, passing through Wei, saw him in the wilds and said to his disciples, \"That old man may be worth speaking to—go and question him.\" Zigong volunteered and, meeting him at the edge of a ridge, sighed as he faced him, \"Sir, do you have no regrets, singing and gleaning as you go?\" Lin Lei walked on without stopping, his song unbroken. Zigong pressed him repeatedly, and at last he looked up and replied, \"What should I regret?\" Zigong said, \"In youth, you did not strive in conduct; in maturity, you did not compete with the times; in old age, you have no wife or children; death approaches—what joy is there in gleaning and singing?\" Lin Lei laughed and said, \"The source of my joy is what all people possess, yet they turn it into sorrow. In youth, I did not strive in conduct; in maturity, I did not compete with the times—thus I have lived so long. In old age, I have no wife or children; death approaches—thus I can be so joyful.\" Zigong said, \"Longevity is what people desire; death is what they detest. Why do you take joy in death?\" Lin Lei said, \"Death and life are but departure and return. How do I know that one who dies here does not live again there? Thus I know they are not the same, and how do I know that busily seeking life is not delusion? How do I know that my death now is not better than my past life?\" Zigong, hearing this, did not grasp his meaning and returned to report it to the Master. The Master said, \"I knew he was one worth speaking to—indeed, so! Yet what he has attained is not yet complete.\"\n\nThe Explanation states: In youth, one strives in conduct to guide oneself forward with reputation. In maturity, one competes with the times, swept away externally by profit and gain. Not coveting fame, thus one does not act for show; not pursuing wealth, thus one does not vie with the times. Free from the pursuit of fame and profit within, unburdened by wife and children without—at ease in old age, approaching rest—knowing that death is but a temporary departure, deeming the frantic pursuit of life as delusion: this is the joy of Lin Lei. Zigong, still delighting in life and dreading death, how could he grasp this man’s heart?\n\nYet even Lin Lei, finding joy in the approach of death, has not attained the Way. One who has attained the Way is utterly indifferent to life and death, regarding them as discarded and entrusted to fate—why would they suddenly feel sorrow or joy between them? When Confucius said he had attained it but not fully, was this not the reason?\n\nMoreover, his view that the frantic pursuit of life is delusion is what he has attained; his claim that present death is better than past life is what he has not yet fully grasped. As for Lin Lei—\"Lin\" meaning \"wild\" in the wilderness, signifying separation from things and estrangement from others, dwelling in the vast and desolate realm—he resembles the Dao of the sage. Thus he finds joy in death, having attained it yet not fully.\n\nZigong, weary of study, told Confucius: \"I wish to rest.\" Confucius said: \"With life, there is no rest.\" Zigong asked: \"Then shall I, Si, have no rest at all?\" Confucius replied: \"There is rest for you.\"\n\nThe Explanation states: Zigong, skilled in rhetoric, heard the Master say Lin Lei was one worth speaking to and thus first realized the folly of excelling in debate. Seeking to diminish his excesses in pursuit of the Dao, he told Confucius he wished to rest. Yet he did not understand that the course of life, entrusted to the great transformation, follows an order that cannot be disordered. While life labors us, how can there be rest?\n\nNevertheless, for Zigong, enlightenment was easy—upon hearing Confucius’ words, he understood the rest of the noble man and the submission of the petty man. Thus Confucius approved, saying: \"Si, you have understood.\" Gazing at the grave mounds—some towering like watchtowers, some smooth like sacrificial vessels, some rounded like hills, some segmented like tripods—he knew where rest lay.\n\nThe Explanation states: The shapes of the mounds—towering, smooth, rounded, segmented—reflect the different ranks of the noble and base, yet all alike find rest there. Zigong said: \"Death is great indeed! The noble man rests there; the petty man submits there.\" Confucius said: \"Si, you have understood. People all know the joy of life but not its suffering; they know the weariness of old age but not its ease; they know the dread of death but not its rest.\"\n\nYanzi said: \"How excellent that the ancients had death! The virtuous rest there; the unvirtuous submit there.\"\n\nThe Explanation states: Rest is like the breath—once exhaled, it returns. Submission is like overpowering things and forcing them down, their movement and stillness governed by another. The noble man’s rest, though transformed, does not perish; the petty man’s submission is blindly rushing toward transformation. The noble man is the fulfillment of benevolence; the petty man is the opposite. Thus Yanzi also said: \"The benevolent rest there; the unbenevolent submit there.\"\n\nThe Laozi treasures compassion above all. To transcend the realm of life and death, nothing precedes the capacity for benevolence and universal love—hence the reference to the noble man’s benevolence. Death is the culmination of virtue. The ancients called the dead \"those who have returned.\" If the dead are called \"those who have returned,\" then the living are \"those who journey.\" One who journeys without knowing to return has lost their home. If one person loses their home, the world condemns them; if the whole world loses its home, none know to condemn it.\n\nThe Explanation states: Human life in the world is like a traveler at an inn—one must ultimately have a place to return. Yet those who cling to life and lose sight of principle are many, while those who early awaken to it are few. The many and the few oppose each other; what is not right is deemed right, and none awaken in the end. Liezi spoke of this not to condemn one man or one generation but simply to unify life and death in a single thread.\n\nIs there one who leaves their homeland, parts from their six relations, abandons their family estate, and roams the four directions without returning—what manner of person is this? The world would surely call them a reckless and dissolute person. And is there one who clings to worldly worth, clings to worldly worth (should say \"cherishes form and life\"), prides themselves on skill and ability, cultivates fame and reputation, and boasts in the world without self-knowledge—what manner of person is this? The world would surely deem them a wise and strategic man. Both are lost, yet the world approves one and not the other. Only the sage knows whom to approve and whom to reject.\n\nThe Explanation states: The reckless person abandons their homeland and neglects their family estate; the strategic man cultivates fame and boasts in the world. The former’s recklessness is deemed petty by custom; the latter’s pursuit of strategy is deemed noble. Yet they do not realize that the reckless one, by leaving their homeland and parting from kin, merely neglects their family estate, while the strategic one, by harming life and injuring nature, strays from their true dwelling—how then can one distinguish noble from petty between them? Zhuangzi spoke of Zang Ke clutching his books and reading, or gambling and wandering, as equally lost like the sheep that strayed—this is what is meant by both being lost.\n\nLiezi, following this, spoke of the value of emptiness, taking stillness and emptiness as finding one’s place, and grasping or relinquishing as losing it—thus the sage’s approval and rejection can be known. Someone asked Liezi: \"Why do you value emptiness?\" Liezi said: \"The empty has no value.\" Liezi said: \"Not in name—nothing compares to stillness, nothing compares to emptiness.\"\n\nStillness and emptiness—these are to find one’s dwelling; grasping and relinquishing—these are to lose one’s place. Those who, after shattering stone to fashion implements, then dance with benevolence and righteousness cannot restore what was broken.\n\nExplanation: Emptiness and stillness are the root of the ten thousand things. Empty, one is thus sufficient to receive the full; still, one is thus sufficient to respond to movement. When emptiness and stillness reside within me, though the myriad changes arise, my heart remains ever tranquil; though the myriad forms differ, my heart remains ever clear—this is the root of responding to things. Thus it is said: nothing compares to stillness, nothing compares to emptiness. Empty yet able to contain, still and ever tranquil, one moves through change and misfortune without departing from the dwelling of one’s nature—this is to find one’s place. To have something to grasp is no longer empty; to have something to give is no longer still. When grasping and relinquishing contend, the ears and eyes turn outward, the mind races like fire and does not return—this is to lose one’s place. *Place* here means the dwelling of one’s nature, in accord with what the Old Master called \"not losing one’s place for long.\" Once one has lost one’s place, only then does one drum up benevolence and righteousness in the wake of things’ withering and ruin—this is merely what strategists use to parade their cleverness before the world. They harm their own nature—how then could they help others restore their original state?\n\nZhu Xiong said: The turning of the cosmos never ceases; heaven and earth shift imperceptibly—who notices? Thus what is diminished there is filled here; what is completed here is depleted there. Loss and fullness, completion and depletion follow the world and follow death. Coming and going meet in succession, with no gap to spare—who notices? For qi does not advance all at once, nor does form deplete all at once; one does not perceive its completion, nor perceive its depletion. It is like a person from youth to old age: countenance, complexion, wisdom, and bearing change without a day’s pause; skin, nails, and hair fall away with the passing world, no different from infancy when nothing halted or remained unchanged. The change is imperceptible until later, when one knows. Explanation: Things and transformation form a single body; the body follows transformation and shifts. Within a hundred years, the great transformation occurs four times, and within it, seasons change and years pass, days alter and months transform. Even in the space of a single breath, the state before and after a sigh differs—old and new are not the same. It is like the wind striking water: the wave before is not the wave after; like a lamp in a jar: the flame before is not the flame after. In the space between lowering and raising one’s gaze, one’s form has already changed ten thousand times. The deluded are secretly shifted by creation yet see only the traces of their own form, unaware of the subtle workings of the great transformation. They rejoice in a thing’s completion, not knowing the principle of its depletion has already begun; they see a matter’s depletion, not knowing the principle of its completion has already advanced. In the *Yuan Jing*, Master Yang spoke of the moon’s waning: its breadth does not compare to the dawn’s radiance in the west—this refers to the subtle shifting of creation and the alternating advance of completion and depletion. Applied to the body, in the toil of a hundred years, countenance, complexion, wisdom, bearing, skin, nails, and hair change without a day’s pause—how could this be clearer? Why then does one not awaken to it? This is the meaning of Zhuangzi’s \"hiding a boat in a ravine.\" The Master, standing by a river, said: \"What passes is like this!\"—this too makes it clear.\n\nIn the state of Qi, there was a man who worried that heaven and earth would collapse, leaving him nowhere to dwell, and so he neglected sleep and food. Another, worried about his worry, went to enlighten him, saying: \"Heaven is but accumulated qi—there is no place without qi. In your bending and stretching, breathing, and moving about all day, you are always within heaven—why worry about collapse?\" The man said: \"If heaven is indeed accumulated qi, then the sun, moon, and stars should not fall?\" The enlightener said: \"The sun, moon, and stars are but luminous things within accumulated qi. Even if they fell, they could not harm anything.\" The man said: \"What of the earth’s ruin?\" The enlightener said: \"The earth is but accumulated clods, filling the four directions—there is no place without clods. In your pacing and treading, you move about all day upon the earth—why worry about its ruin?\" The man was suddenly greatly relieved. The enlightener was also suddenly greatly relieved.\n\nChangluzi heard this and laughed, saying: \"The rainbow, the clouds and mist, the wind and rain, the four seasons—these are the forms taken by accumulated qi in the heavens. The mountains and peaks, the rivers and seas, the metals and stones, the fire and wood—these are the forms taken by accumulated matter on the earth. Knowing that they are but accumulated qi and accumulated clods, how can one say they will not perish?\n\n\"Now, the heavens and earth are but a tiny thing within the void, the greatest of all things within the bounded. That they are difficult to exhaust, difficult to fathom—this is certainly so. That they are difficult to measure, difficult to comprehend—this is certainly so. To worry over their ruin is indeed too remote, yet to say they will not ruin is also incorrect. Since the heavens and earth cannot but perish, they will eventually return to ruin. When that time comes, how can one not grieve?\n\nZiliezi heard this and laughed, saying: \"To say the heavens and earth will perish is also mistaken; to say they will not perish is also mistaken. Whether they perish or not, I cannot know. Nevertheless, that is one state, and this is another. Thus, the living do not know death, the dead do not know life; the coming does not know the going, the going does not know the coming. Whether they perish or not, why should I concern myself?\"\n\nThe commentary says: The number of things is called the \"ten thousand,\" yet man is but one among them. Compared to the ten thousand things, is he not like a hair’s tip upon a horse’s body? Thus, the human body, lodged between heaven and earth, is exceedingly insignificant. Moreover, the vault of heaven arches above, its warp forming the sun and moon, its weft forming the stars, and the ten thousand things are covered by it. The earth spreads vast below, its knots forming mountains and peaks, its flows forming rivers and seas, and the ten thousand things are borne upon it. The heavens’ longevity, the earth’s endurance—these are not what man can hastily measure. Yet the man of the state of Qi worried that his body would have nowhere to lodge, even to the point of abandoning sleep and food. Was the vastness of heaven and earth truly insufficient to contain his body? Rather, the man had no way to contain himself. Why did he not reflect that from the time heaven and earth have existed until now, there have been countless deaths and births, beyond reckoning? Why should he alone come to worry over this? His worry was truly lamentable, for it was a self-loss of man. Yet to worry over what he worried about was to lament the lamenter’s lament.\n\nHaving already worried, and then being further enlightened by such crude and shallow principles of things, only to suddenly rejoice—alas! Heaven is eternal, earth is enduring; what do they care for the fewness or multitude of such men? Why should such a man hastily allow his deluded heart to swing between worry and joy?\n\nChangluzi heard this and laughed, and his words seemed apt. To say the heavens and earth are but a tiny thing within the void, the greatest within the bounded—this principle cannot be refuted. Yet to say, 'When their time of ruin comes, how can one not grieve?'—this is to grasp the truth without exhausting it. For where the principle of completion lies, there is unity everywhere. Whether it is that or this, in the end there is no duality. To use duality to reach unity is to have no other unity. If one understands that the One is not two, then life and death, coming and going, each do not know the other. Dwelling within the universe, drinking the harmony of heaven, eating the virtue of earth, one may peacefully live out one’s life—why need one know whether they perish or not? This is why Changluzi was further laughed at by Ziliezi.\n\nShun asked Cheng (in the *Zhuangzi*, written as \"Cheng\"): \"Can the Dao be obtained and possessed?\"\n\nCheng said: \"Your body is not your own—how can you possess the Dao?\"\n\nShun said: \"If my body is not my own, then who possesses it?\"\n\nCheng said: \"It is the entrusted form of heaven and earth. Life is not your own—it is the entrusted harmony of heaven and earth. Nature and destiny are not your own—they are the entrusted compliance of heaven and earth. Children and grandchildren are not your own—they are the entrusted shedding of heaven and earth. Thus, in walking you do not know where you go, in dwelling you do not know what you hold, in eating you do not know why. Heaven and earth are but the strong yang qi—how can you possess anything?\"\n\nThe commentary says: The Dao and I are of different names but the same reality. The Dao is I, and I am the Dao—there is no difference or separation. The realms of being and non-being, the contrast of emptiness and fullness—if it can be obtained and possessed, it can also be lost and absent. The Dao does not leave me—how can there be a separate 'heavenly Dao'? To say the Dao can be obtained and possessed is to make the Dao and me two. Shun’s question to Cheng was to claim the Dao exclusively for his own body. Yet this body of mine is but the accumulation of heaven and earth’s strong yang qi, temporarily gathered and soon to disperse—it is not truly mine. How can I possess the Dao?\n\nExamining this body of mine: Heaven endows it with nature, and with nature comes life; with life comes the body. Nature and destiny arise from heaven and earth’s entrusted compliance; life arises from heaven and earth’s entrusted harmony; the body arises from heaven and earth’s entrusted form. As for children and grandchildren, that is even more distant—they are but the entrusted shedding of heaven and earth. Thus, whether walking, dwelling, or tasting, I always depend on that which I do not know. If one wishes to know one’s body, one may observe it as a shadow knows its form. The body’s relation to me is like the shadow’s to the form—where the strong yang is, I am with it. How can the strong yang be possessed?\n\nLaozi said: \"My great trouble is that I have a body.\" For he sought to return to the state before birth, without a body, and thus unite with the Dao. Shun was an ancient great sage, yet he asked Cheng about the Dao. This was because Shun, though compelled to govern the world after Yao, had already departed from the Dao in manifesting virtue. Thus, he spoke as he did. Cheng was one who assisted rulers with the Dao.\n\nIn Qi, the Guo family was immensely wealthy; in Song, the Xiang family was desperately poor. The Xiang family traveled from Song to Qi to ask for their method. The Guo family told them: \"I am skilled in theft.\"\n\nAt first when I practiced theft, within a year I had enough, within two years I was self-sufficient, and within three years I had grown vastly prosperous. From then on, my bounty extended to the towns and villages.\n\nThe Xiang family rejoiced greatly, understanding his words about theft but not grasping the Dao of theft. They then scaled walls and broke into houses, taking whatever their hands and eyes could reach. Before long, they were caught with stolen goods and punished, their ancestral wealth confiscated. The Xiang family, believing the Guo family had deceived them, went to complain. The Guo family asked: \"How did you practice theft?\" The Xiang family described what they had done. The Guo family exclaimed: \"Alas! Have you lost the Dao of theft to such an extent? Now I will tell you.\n\nI have heard that Heaven has its seasons, Earth its advantages. I steal Heaven and Earth’s timely benefits—the soaking nourishment of clouds and rain, the produce of mountains and marshes—to grow my grain, cultivate my crops, build my walls, and construct my dwellings. On land, I steal from birds and beasts; in water, I steal from fish and turtles—nothing is not stolen. Yet grain, crops, trees, birds, beasts, fish, and turtles are all born of Heaven. How can they be mine? Yet when I steal from Heaven, I incur no misfortune.\n\nGold, jade, precious treasures, grain, silk, and wealth are what people amass. How can they be Heaven’s gifts? If you steal them and are punished, whom can you blame?\"\n\nThe Xiang family was deeply perplexed, thinking the Guo family was again deceiving them. They went to consult Master Dongguo, who said: \"Is not your very body itself theft? You steal the harmony of yin and yang to complete your life and sustain your form. How much more so with external things—are they not also theft?\n\nTruly, Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things are inseparable. To claim possession of them is delusion. The Guo family’s theft is the public Dao, so they incur no misfortune. Your theft is driven by private desire, so you were punished. Those who act with public or private intent are both thieves; those who act without public or private intent are also thieves. The interplay of public and private is the virtue of Heaven and Earth. Who can say what is theft and what is not?\n\nThe explanation states: *The Book of the Yellow Emperor* says: Heaven and Earth are the thieves of the myriad things; the myriad things are the thieves of man; man is the thief of the myriad things. When the three thieves are in harmony, the Three Powers are at peace.\n\nFor Heaven bestows, Earth gives birth, and the labor of the myriad things transforms them. The myriad things rely on human effort to grow and flourish, while humans rely on the myriad things for sustenance. Heaven and Earth are not wholly efficacious, the sage is not wholly capable, and the myriad things are not wholly useful. What they lack, they borrow from without—is this not theft? Thus, anything taken that is not one’s own is theft. Why must one take only what hands and eyes can reach to be called a thief?\n\nYet Heaven and Earth’s creative transformations are boundless, the myriad things born of them are infinite, while human efforts to seize and claim them are limited. The Guo family steals from Heaven and Earth—this is the public Dao, so they prospered greatly and their bounty extended to the towns and villages. The Xiang family stole from what others had amassed—this was private desire. Since they had already amassed it with private intent, for you to profit from it was fitting that you were punished and your ancestral wealth confiscated.\n\nHowever, if one regards having public or private intent as theft, then having neither public nor private intent should not be theft. Yet once one assumes human form, the body is not one’s own—where can one go that is not theft? Even without intent toward public or private, how can one escape the constraints of form?\n\nMoreover, theft is one, yet the theft of the public Dao differs from that of private desire and avoids the calamities of human conduct. The theft without public or private intent, though not yet free of form, differs from those who value life and cherish the body through the public Dao.\n\nAs for the virtue of Heaven and Earth, it does not intend to be public—it lets the myriad things be public of themselves. It does not intend to be without private intent—it lets the myriad things be private of themselves. To speak of this is to ask: Are not the myriad things’ theft from man, and man’s theft from the myriad things, merely the accumulation of Heaven and Earth’s great theft? Heaven and Earth’s creation and transformation of the myriad things begin and end here. Thus, *The Celestial Axis* concludes at this point.\n\nLet us consider this: When a single rabbit runs into the wild, a hundred people chase it, and no one faults them. But when a child catches it, even if a strong man could overpower a hundred, he dare not take it by force. Why? Because the division of names and duties is fixed.\"\n\nThe fleeting life of man, with its myriad branching and divergent intentions, clings to self-interest amidst Heaven and Earth—like those who chase the rabbit, each drawing lines to claim possession. Those who seize what chance brings them truly believe it their own; those who fail to seize it likewise believe it truly belongs to another. Thus, they covet more, strive to acquire, hoard fame and profit, delight in them all their lives, and fear only that others might glimpse their gain. How would they know that their very selves are but thieves?\n\nAlas! Heaven and Earth’s generation of the myriad things is not the Dao of Heaven and Earth. For their generation is boundless, their transformation inexhaustible, allowing men to steal from them so that households grow rich without calamity. How much more so is the Dao of Heaven and Earth vast and all-embracing? If one could grasp it, its abundance would be beyond all reckoning.\n\n*The Celestial Axis* elucidates the Six Classics as records of the Dao for later ages. It embeds the marvel of spirit within forms, names, measures, and numbers, and lodges the subtleties of the heart’s workings amid benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and music. In its manifest aspect, even the foolishness of common men and women can partake of it. In its marvelous aspect, even the wisdom of sages cannot fully comprehend it. What can be grasped lies in its words being near at hand; what cannot be known lies in its meaning pointing afar. Such is the transmission of the Classics.\n\nBeyond the Six Classics, those who establish teachings and compose books exhaustively expound the wondrous workings of the Dao, gathering its scattered aspects into unity, shedding its blossoms to reveal its fruit, discerning things and restoring nature, aspiring to tranquility and simplicity, and illuminating the inner and outer teachings of the Six Classics—none surpass the books of Laozi, Zhuangzi, and Liezi.\n\nThough the three perfected ones’ scriptures all transmit the marvelous principle, their aims in establishing teachings differ, yet the Dao may still be spoken of thus: The ninety-nine chapters of the *Laozi* clarify the essential return of virtue and the Dao. In just a few thousand words, it examines its beginning and end, declaring the Dao that can be spoken not the eternal Dao, calling the highest virtue no-virtue, and taking the sage’s Dao as non-contention. Though it speaks of the sage’s way of responding to the world, it never touches upon the sovereigns of high antiquity; though it sets forth the principles of the myriad things’ generation and transformation, it never touches upon the realm of plants and animals. This is why the *Laozi* is supremely marvelous and concise.\n\nAs for the *Zhuangzi*, it employs \"goblet words\" to unfold endlessly, \"repeated words\" to convey truth, and \"parable words\" to broaden its reach. Its text flows freely without harm, its language strange and wondrous yet worthy of contemplation. The *Laozi*’s concision gains clarity through the *Zhuangzi*, and its Dao becomes all the more luminous.\n\nAs for the teachings of the *Liezi*, their primal marvel lies in the *Laozi*’s virtue and Dao, and their strangeness likewise resides in the *Zhuangzi*’s parables. They elucidate the *Laozi*’s essential marvels without indulging in the *Zhuangzi*’s expansiveness. The three scriptures’ aims converge in the Dao, with the *Liezi*’s teachings appropriately situated between them. Only by understanding this can one read the *Liezi*.\n\nWhat, then, is the Dao? It is that which is marvelous and unknowable. By \"marvelous,\" we do not mean that it is marvelous because it is empty, nonexistent, or non-active. Rather, it is marvelous because it operates above the myriad things yet cannot be fathomed.\n\nGreat is the Dao! As the primordial resource nurturing the myriad things, its spontaneity necessarily takes generation and transformation as primary; its shaping necessarily takes yin and yang as its origin. Thus, this scripture begins by clarifying the generation and transformation of celestial portents. \"Heaven\" refers to the Dao that is not made by anything; \"portent\" refers to things that accord with verification. \"Celestial portent\" is the tally of spontaneity.\n\nTracing the Dao of generation and transformation, it cannot be made clear apart from things, nor can it be exhausted by clinging to things. Clinging to things is insufficient to speak of generation and transformation, for generation and transformation are not exhausted by activity. Departing from things, there is no way to manifest generation and transformation, for generation and transformation do not abide in inactivity. It says: There is generation that does not generate, transformation that does not transform. That which does not generate and does not transform originates in Heaven’s spontaneity; that which generates and transforms accords with portents as verification. The Dao of generation and transformation is fully contained herein.\n\nSince the Great Simplicity already existed, the Great Beginning followed it; the Great Commencement appeared, and the Great Prime presaged it. Once the beginnings of qi, form, and substance were complete, it could be named \"Change.\" Change alters to become the One; the One is the beginning of form’s alterations. In the obscure depths, its sequence already lacks even a hair’s breadth of disorder. Once it has fallen into form’s alterations, the clear and turbid diverge at their source, Heaven and Earth settle into their positions, man embodies their harmony, and things contain their essence.\n\nThough Heaven and Earth are vast, their Dao can be matched to yin and yang; though the sage’s Dao is marvelous, its teachings can be verified in benevolence and righteousness; though the myriad things are many, their transformations can be united in softness and hardness. Thus, even when shaping man’s form, none can escape the changes of creation.\n\nAs for the myriad things’ emergence from and return to the mechanism—whether sentient or insentient, alternating and transforming—this may indeed be called marvelous. Once transformation has settled into constancy, it cannot disrupt the tally of spontaneity. Thus, the transformations of the mole cricket’s feet may produce a grub but cannot produce a butterfly; the transformations of the frog may produce a quail but cannot produce a wren. The principle of generation and transformation accords thus, which is why the people of Qi, seeing that what has form must end, and observing that Heaven and Earth manifestly contain things, fell into petty and excessive calculations.\n\nYet the tally of spontaneity, in its beginning, must have something from which it arises; in its arising, must have a fitting and fixed position; in its end, must have a means by which it returns. Beginning must end, and ending must return to the beginning. The changes of one, seven, and nine cycle endlessly without terminus—this is why the principle of generation and transformation endures eternally without cease.\n\nIt is fitting that things without awareness sink into the depths of creation. But man, the spirit of the myriad things, though not exempt from generation and transformation, also possesses the principle of neither generating nor transforming within himself.\n\nWhy not turn inward to seek sincerity within oneself? Why willingly remain within the realm of creation, drifting and migrating alongside the myriad things? The teachings of Liezi aim to enable scholars to perceive the marvel of ceaseless generation and transformation even amid generation and transformation itself, and to follow the tally of creation without being constrained by it.\n\nThus, at the close of the chapter, he attributes the words to Shun inquiring of Cheng about the Dao, in order to dispel the burdens of having life. Yet this is still deemed insufficient—he goes so far as to declare that this very body of ours is a thief of Heaven and Earth. Even Heaven and Earth, in their generation and transformation, are likewise called thieves. Theft is what all people revile, yet I have come into being through theft.\n\nIf life bears this form, then what makes one value life or cherish the body, thereby transgressing what others detest? Here, *Heavenly Portents* concludes.\n\n*Explication of the Perfect Classic of the Dao and Virtue of the Most Vacuous* [Volume Two] ends.\n\n*Explication of the Perfect Classic of the Dao and Virtue of the Most Vacuous* [Volume Three]\nPresented by Jiang Yu, Inner Student of the Hangzhou Prefecture School of the Song Dynasty. [Yellow Emperor]\n\nWhen the Yellow Emperor had reigned for fifteen years, he rejoiced that all under Heaven bore him willingly, nurturing his proper destiny, delighting his ears and eyes, and gratifying his nose and mouth—yet his complexion grew parched and sallow, and his five faculties dimmed in confusion. After another fifteen years, he fretted that all under Heaven remained untended, exhausting his keen hearing and bright vision, advancing his wisdom and strength to govern the hundred clans—yet his complexion grew parched and sallow, and his five faculties dimmed in confusion.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor then sighed in lament, saying: \"My excesses have run deep indeed. Nurturing the self alone brings such affliction; governing the myriad things brings such affliction.\"\n\n*Explication states:* The principle of life values unrestrained spontaneity. To harbor intent in nurturing the self is to tread the path of its undoing. The hundred clans call me natural, yet to harbor intent in governing the myriad things is likewise to tread the path of affliction. Thus, delighting the ears and eyes, gratifying the nose and mouth, and indulging in joyful exultation—this is not tranquility. Exhausting keen hearing and bright vision, advancing wisdom and strength, and dwelling in anxious sorrow—this is not contentment. Without tranquility and contentment, there is no virtue. Though the nurturing of the body and the governing of things differ, and though sorrow and joy diverge, their harm to life and injury to nature are the same. Harm to life thus parches the complexion and sallows the skin; injury to nature thus dims the five faculties in confusion. For fifteen years make a generation—half spent in sorrow, half in joy, outwardly wearing the body, inwardly wounding nature—where then lies the joy of life? This is why the Yellow Emperor sighed deeply over his excesses and sought the Perfect Dao.\n\nThereupon, he relinquished all affairs of state, abandoned his palace chambers, dismissed his attendants, silenced the bells and chimes, reduced his kitchen provisions, and retired to dwell in leisure at the Hall of the Great Court. There, he purified his heart and disciplined his form, abstaining from governance for three months. One day, as he napped in broad daylight, he dreamed of wandering in the land of Huaxu.\n\n*Explication states:* Relinquishing all affairs of state severs entanglements; abandoning palace chambers ensures unwearied movement; dismissing attendants ensures independence and constancy...\n\nSilencing the bells and chimes, reducing kitchen provisions—thus are the pleasures of ear, eye, nose, and mouth removed. Dwelling in leisure at the Hall of the Great Court, one roams freely and abides in the vast dwelling. Purifying the heart and disciplining the form, clarity, wisdom, and strength are not employed. Abstaining from governance for three months, one remains still and unmoving; passing through time’s changes yet unaltered. Napping in broad daylight and dreaming, the form does not engage with things, yet luminously communes with spirit.\n\nThe land of Huaxu is where spirit resides. Forced to name it, yet it has no substance—only those who embrace spirit with their nature may wander there. Thus was the realm where the Yellow Emperor dreamed of traveling. The land of Huaxu lies west of Yan Prefecture and north of Tai Prefecture. Who knows how many thousands of *li* distant it is from this world? It is not a place reachable by boat, carriage, or foot—only by spirit can one travel there.\n\n*Explication states:* The northwest is the profound recess of Heaven and Earth, the primal gate of inner illumination—hence the land of Huaxu is situated there. Though forced to name it and locate it in a direction, it is not bound by direction, nor constrained by measure. Thus it is said: \"Who knows how many thousands of *li* distant it is from this world? Only by spirit can one travel there.\"\n\nIn that land, there are no teachers or rulers—it is so of itself. Its people have no desires—it is so of itself. They do not delight in life, nor do they abhor death, and so there is no premature demise. They do not favor themselves, nor do they distance others, and so there is no love or hatred. They do not oppose or comply, and so there is no profit or harm. They cherish nothing, nor do they fear anything. Entering water, they do not drown; entering fire, they do not burn. Cut or struck, they feel no pain; poked or prodded, they feel no itch. Treading emptiness as though it were solid, resting in the void as though on a bed. Clouds and mist do not obstruct their sight; thunder and lightning do not disturb their hearing. Beauty and ugliness do not unsettle their hearts; mountains and valleys do not trip their steps—only spirit moves.\n\n*Explication states:* As the saying goes: \"Without clothing and food, the way of ruler and minister ceases.\" In that land, there are no teachers or rulers, and its people have no desires—it is so of itself. Moreover, the absence of rulers is not because the people are governed by non-desire; it is so of itself. The absence of desires is not because of a sagely ruler’s governance; it is so of itself. When the Dao reaches the state of spontaneity, then what the world calls desire and aversion, closeness and distance, opposition and compliance, love and fear—all are forgotten. How then could there be the misfortune of premature death, the passions of love and hatred, or the choices of profit and harm? Thus one may enter water and fire, forget pain and itch, tread emptiness as though it were solid, abide in solidity as though it were void, see and hear with perfect clarity, remain unperturbed in heart, and walk without stumbling.\n\nTrue emptiness is not empty—treading emptiness is like reality, yet not truly real, hence it is said \"as though treading solid ground.\" True void is not void—resting in the void is like the void, yet not truly void, hence it is said \"as though on a bed.\" Who but one of utmost spirit could attain this? The true persons of old slept without dreaming and awoke without sorrow. The Yellow Emperor was one who discerned waking and dreaming—thus his wandering in Huaxu was a true dream. That he entrusted it to a dream was not merely to follow a fleeting moment.\n\nWhen the Yellow Emperor awoke, he was joyfully content. He summoned Tian Lao, Li Mu, and Tai Shan Ji and said to them: \"I have dwelled in leisure for three months, purifying my heart and disciplining my form, seeking the Dao to nurture the body and govern things, yet I did not attain its method. Exhausted, I slept, and dreamed thus. Now I know the Perfect Dao cannot be sought through emotion. I have understood it, I have attained it—but I cannot explain it to you.\"\n\nTwenty-eight years later, the world was greatly ordered, nearly like the land of Huaxu.\n\n*Explication states:* Tian Lao embodies the effortless way of Heaven. Li Mu is the skilled steward of human governance. Tai Shan Ji represents the greatest of earthly categories. One who attains the Dao can command the Three Powers and employ the transformations of creation—thus the Yellow Emperor, joyfully content, summoned these three to inform them.\n\nThe Dao has emotion and sincerity, yet the Perfect Dao cannot be sought through emotion—for the Dao does not reject emotion, yet it cannot be attained by seeking. The so-called Perfect Dao is the Dao that does not depart from the true. How could there be a method to be pondered and sought? Thus, seeking the Perfect Dao through emotion will never suffice to attain the Dao. Only after exhaustion and sleep, dreaming thus, and then awakening, does one become joyfully content. For in exhaustion and sleep, the limbs relax and wisdom and strength are not employed—then in dreams, one truly communes with spirit.\n\nOnly one who has attained the Perfect Dao can govern the world without governing, so that it is ordered. Thus, twenty-eight years later, the world was greatly ordered, nearly like the land of Huaxu. Twenty-eight is the number of four sevens. Seven times seven is the number of *tian gui*, reaching its mean and utmost flourishing. Though the Yellow Emperor’s governance did not depart from effort, his rule could not escape this number. Moreover, seven times seven is a yin number, and the Yellow Emperor was then gathering brilliance to return to the root—hence he particularly spoke of the flourishing of yin numbers.\n\nIf the Dao does not reach the true, no one sleeps without dreaming—how then could one reach Huaxu? Upon awakening, one is joyfully content. For what one loves by day, one dreams of by night. If the Yellow Emperor had purified his heart and disciplined his form, his waking thoughts and dreams would have dissolved. If he dreamed, it could only have been of Huaxu. But if one cannot align the heart and discipline the form, one is enslaved by thoughts and constrained by yin and yang. One who dreams of drinking wine wakes to weep; one who dreams of weeping wakes to hunt. Thus are waking and dreaming inverted, and gain and loss, sorrow and joy remain unsettled—how many thousands of *li* distant is one then from the land of Huaxu?\n\nMoreover, that daytime thoughts give rise to nighttime dreams is the natural principle. Yet here it is framed as a dream occurring during daytime slumber—for daytime is the midpoint of the sun’s course, the time when one is most entangled in worldly affairs. If the spirit wanders even while the body is engaged in such affairs, then the spirit never departs from the body for even an instant.\n\nLet us consider this: the achievements of emperors and kings are but the incidental undertakings of sages. The sage acts only when unavoidable, and even then, surrenders action to things, allowing them to act on their own—thus should there be no burden of deliberate doing. Yet once action is taken, the achievements of emperors and kings are accomplished, and the Great Dao recedes. When Liezi sought to clarify how the sage responds to the role of emperor or king while never straying from the ultimate Dao, he began his discourse with the Yellow Emperor, for in speaking of the Dao, the Yellow Emperor represents its highest attainment. Yet upon ascending the throne and engaging with the world, the tumult of worldly entanglements arises. Whether governing or in chaos, joy or sorrow, such involvements become unavoidable.\n\nNevertheless, the Yellow Emperor, emerging from the great source to respond to things, constantly embodied the inexhaustible and wandered without obstruction. Thus, he entrusted his worldly engagements to the dream of Huaxu to dispel their traces. When he aligned his heart and disciplined his form, gathering the traces of worldly response to return to the ultimate Dao, he nearly attained the governance of the Huaxu clan—such was the Yellow Emperor that the world never beheld. People merely cling to his outdated traces, pondering without enlightenment.\n\nTherefore, this chapter concludes with Jixian’s physiognomy of Master Hu, revealing to him that which had never departed from the source—whereupon Jixian, unable to divine anything, fled in disarray. This discourse thus elucidates the ultimate principle of rulership, which is why *Zhuangzi’s* “Responding to Emperors and Kings” also concludes with this passage.\n\nMount Liegushe lies amidst the islands of the sea and rivers. Upon its summit dwells a spirit-person who inhales the wind and drinks the dew, partaking not of the five grains. The heart is like a deep spring, the form like a maiden’s; neither clinging nor cherishing, immortals and sages serve as ministers; neither fearing nor angering, the sincere and guileless act as envoys. Without bestowing or favoring, things are naturally sufficient; without amassing or hoarding, one remains free of fault. Yin and yang are ever harmonized, sun and moon ever bright, the four seasons ever orderly, wind and rain ever balanced, nurturance ever timely, grains ever abundant. The land knows no blight, people no premature death, creatures no blemish or plague, and ghosts no eerie manifestations.\n\nExplanation: *Gu* means “for the time being,” and *she* means “to be sated.”\n\nMount Guye is where those who, wearied by worldly entanglements, dwell in temporary response to what cannot be avoided. Water nearly approaches the Dao, and the sea is where the waters of rivers return. Mount Guye lies amid its isles, signifying its place at the center of the Dao—who but a spirit-person could abide here? Not eating the five grains, inhaling the wind and drinking the dew, one savors the Dao’s blandness, which is flavorless. The heart like a deep spring is still and concentrated, never straying. The form like a maiden responds to things without initiating. Neither clinging nor cherishing, one treats the myriad things as straw dogs. Neither fearing nor angering, one guards the purity of qi. Without bestowing or favoring, things are naturally sufficient—this is what is meant by \"no one loses a single hair.\" Without amassing or hoarding, one remains free of fault—this is what is meant by \"no one seeks gain from the world.\" From the ever-harmonized yin and yang to the absence of eerie manifestations among ghosts, this is what Lord Lao called \"peace and great stability.\"\n\nLiezi studied under Master Lao Shang and befriended Bo Gaozi. *Shang* means the sound of metal; *Lao Shang* refers to one who returns to nature, restores destiny, and practices non-action. *Bo Gaozi* refers to one whose years grow ever higher and whose virtue ever more expansive. Thus did Liezi take such figures as teachers and friends. Liezi once studied under Master Huqiu and befriended Bohun Maoren. Since the Dao is present everywhere, what fixed teacher could there be? Advancing the Way of these two masters, he rode the wind and returned.\n\nYin Sheng heard of this and lived with Liezi, yet for months he did not attend to his own dwelling. Finding an opportunity, he requested to learn his arts, but after ten inquiries, Liezi gave no answer. Yin Sheng, resentful, asked to leave, but Liezi did not respond. Yin Sheng withdrew. Months later, his resolve unshaken, he returned to follow Liezi again. Liezi said, \"Why do you come and go so frequently?\" Yin Sheng replied, \"Before, when Zhang Dai asked you, you did not tell me, so I harbored resentment. Now, my grievance has dissolved, and so I have returned.\" Liezi said, \"Formerly, I took you for one who understood, but now your vulgarity has reached this point? Ji, I will tell you what I learned from my master.\"\n\n*Zhuangzi* says: If the Dao could be conveyed to others, none would fail to tell their brothers. Ten inquiries met with ten refusals—it was not that he did not wish to tell, but that he did not know how to tell. When Nie Que questioned Wang Ni, four questions met with four non-answers. To know that questioning is futile is to say that three questions met with three non-answers would be excessive. As for Zhang Dai, he was one who exalted literary refinement and placed it above all else—how could he be fit to speak of Master Lao Shang’s non-action? Thus, having followed Liezi, he left in resentment, and after months away, returned with his grievance dissolved. His comings and goings were inconsistent, his resentments repeated—so vulgar and unenlightened in the Dao, he would never draw near. Thus, Liezi was compelled to tell him:\n\n\"Since I began serving my master and befriending such men, after three years, my heart dared not entertain right or wrong, my mouth dared not speak of benefit or harm, and only then did my master deign to glance at me. After five years, my heart again pondered right and wrong, my mouth again spoke of benefit and harm, and only then did my master relax his expression and smile. After seven years, my heart followed its thoughts without right or wrong, my mouth spoke without benefit or harm, and only then did my master draw me to sit beside him. After nine years, my heart roamed freely in its thoughts, my mouth spoke freely, yet I knew not whether my right and wrong, benefit and harm were mine or another’s; I knew not whether my master was my teacher or those men my friends—inner and outer had merged. Only then were my eyes like ears, my ears like nose, my nose like mouth, all the same. My heart congealed, my form dissolved, bones and flesh fused entirely. I did not sense the body’s support or the feet’s tread, drifting with the wind east and west like a leaf or dry husk—did the wind ride me, or did I ride the wind?\n\nNow you, having entered the master’s gate for barely a moment, have already harbored resentment twice. Your limbs will not bear qi, your joints will not be supported by the earth. To tread emptiness and ride the wind—how could you hope for this?\" Yin Sheng was deeply shaken, held his breath for a long while, and dared not speak again.\n\nA commentary states: Right and wrong reside in principle; benefit and harm lie in affairs. What was once deemed right may now be considered wrong—thus right and wrong originally have no fixed form. What I deem beneficial, others may find harmful—thus benefit and harm originally have no constant truth. The reason right and wrong, benefit and harm arise is this: in human life, desire arises from having a body, and love arises from the body. Desire gives rise to love, and the seven emotions intermingle. The eyes pursue form, the ears follow sound, the nose drifts toward fragrance, the tongue craves flavor. Within a single body, each part remains unaware of the others. Though all share in the perceptions of ears and eyes, left and right occupy different positions, so brightness and darkness may differ—how then can there be no divergence? From this we know that right and wrong, benefit and harm all emerge from the perceptions of ears, eyes, nose, and mouth. Yet these perceptions arise from the luminous and perfect nature. When nature confronts things, things align with the self, thereby forming the body. Though the body is not unified, nature ultimately remains undivided.\n\nWhen this singular nature splits into the seven emotions, it does not originally belong to them. If it then severs from the luminous whole, why should it depend on external things? If one can awaken to even a single truth amid sounds, forms, scents, and flavors, and return to rest in the real, then the seven apertures all withdraw. Ears, eyes, nose, and mouth merge into one. Looking back upon the myriad things of the world, their bustling confusion appears like snowflakes glimpsed through a veil—all dissolve and unite with true essence. How much more so for this single body of ours? This is the Way by which Liezi treads emptiness and rides the wind. Liezi possessed innate knowledge of this Way and attained it naturally—what need had he for study? Yet to transmit instruction, he necessarily placed it within the context of a learner, guiding them step by step through ordered practice.\n\nIf the heart dares not entertain thoughts of right and wrong, and the mouth dares not speak of benefit and harm, then one can cast off cunning and artifice. This marks the progression from a year in the wild to three years of penetrating understanding. The \"dare not\" does not mean the absence of such thoughts—it means one has not yet reached the state where the Way is present at a single glance. Thus, one first receives but a glance from Old Shang. By the fifth year, the heart again contemplates right and wrong, the mouth again speaks of benefit and harm. Yet these thoughts and words arise naturally, without pride or reluctance, so the Way flows unimpeded through the heart. Thus, the master relaxes his countenance and smiles, no longer selecting among the heart’s thoughts or the mouth’s words.\n\nUntil the seventh year of celestial completion, one cannot yet act freely without constraint—such a one is not yet fit to weigh alternatives. How could they keep pace with Huzi, matching his level and driving abreast? Only when thoughts follow the heart and words follow the mouth, utterly devoid of right and wrong, benefit and harm, does the master draw them near to share his seat. Yet even then, this is merely acting freely—though one may say there is no right and wrong, benefit and harm, one has not yet attained the state of \"no nothingness.\"\n\nOnly after advancing to the ninth year of great subtlety do the heart’s thoughts and the tongue’s words flow unbounded. One no longer knows others’ right and wrong, benefit and harm, nor one’s own—all becomes the same. When the Way reaches this point, one values neither natural endowment nor teacher. Thus, one no longer knows whether the master is one’s teacher or those men one’s friends—inner and outer merge. Only then do the seven apertures return to the one real, the hundred bones harmonize with the great void. Dwelling between heaven and earth, one drifts with the wind east and west like a leaf or dry husk—does the wind ride me, or do I ride the wind?\n\nTo say I ride the wind—does the drifting leaf also have a mind to ride the wind? To say the wind rides me—does the wind’s blowing ever depend on me? Yet riding the wind and traveling, one moves with effortless grace, not knowing why it is so, only that it is so. Though it is said that bones and flesh entirely fuse, one still compares them to leaves and husks. For there is the qi of life and the form of existence—one can make them empty but not make them nothing. Though there is form, one is not burdened by it—this may be called emptiness. Though still as light as a leaf or husk, one has not yet departed from \"having something.\" This is why *Zhuangzi* says Liezi still had something to depend on—this is the great subtlety of the Way. If it were merely nothingness, what value would the Way hold?\n\nAs for one like Yin Sheng, harboring resentment within, his qi of anger and frustration disrupts the great harmony. His life is but a wart or tumor upon heaven and earth. Having entered the master’s gate for barely a moment, he has already expressed resentment twice. If he carries these deluded emotions to the end of his days, he will only sink deeper. Though the earth’s vast capacity bears all, it cannot support even a single joint of his sinking body.\n\nAlas! All living beings share the same mandate from creation, yet a single divergence in emotion and thought leads to such vast differences in ascent and descent. Thus, Liezi took special care to address this. Liezi asked Guan Yin: \"The perfected person moves through water without obstruction, treads fire without heat, walks above the myriad things without fear. May I ask how one attains this?\" Guan Yin replied: \"This is the preservation of pure qi—it does not belong to the realm of cleverness, skill, or boldness.\"\n\nA commentary states: The perfected person does not depart from the real. With the real within, what thing could alter it? This is why the perfected person enters water without getting wet, enters fire without heat, ascends heights without fear. Guan Yin speaks of attaining this through the preservation of pure qi—\"pure\" means not diminishing one’s spirit. Not diminishing one’s spirit is how one remains real. As for cleverness, skill, and boldness, these involve a mind set on overcoming things. With suspicion and calculation within and blustering qi without, even a single joint or part of the body would not be tolerated between heaven and earth—how could one draw near to water or fire?\n\nOnly when pure qi is inwardly preserved do knowledge and perception revert, sight and hearing withdraw inward, and none can discern their agency—water and fire become one with them. This is why there is no entry where they do not find themselves at ease.\n\nThe Old Master said: *\"One whose virtue is profoundly contained is like a newborn babe.\"* This is precisely what is meant by the preservation of pure qi. Thus, poisonous creatures do not sting, fierce beasts do not seize, and grasping birds do not strike. Ji, the fish, speaks to you: All that has form, image, sound, or color is but *thing*—how can one thing be distant from another? Yet how could this suffice to reach the primordial? It is but *form* after all.\n\nA commentary states: Form, image, sound, and color are all called *form*. All things arise from non-being into being, beginning with movement and giving rise to form. When primordial simplicity is complete, physical form first becomes manifest. Yet primordial simplicity does not reach the Great Beginning—how then could it attain the primordial? Only one who treats things as things yet is not a thing can reach the primordial. In reaching the primordial, does this not resemble what the Old Master called *\"a thing unformed and complete\"*? It is the creation of things before form, resting where there is no transformation. Yet those who attain this and exhaust it—how could they be called *upright*?\n\nA commentary states: All that has form belongs to creation and transformation. Only that which creates before form rests where there is no transformation. Those who attain this Dao and exhaust it depart from form, transcend transformation, and reach the state before things, dissolving distinctions of right and wrong. Though uniquely upright, this cannot be named. This is how the perfected person remains real.\n\nThey dwell in a measure not profound, conceal themselves in a principle without end, and roam through the beginning and end of the myriad things.\n\nA commentary states: What is most easy to know and most easy to practice—this is the measure not profound, for it does not violate the natural course of the myriad things. The Old Master took *\"following and meeting without seeing its head or tail\"* as the principle of the Dao—this is what is meant by the principle without end. Moving among the myriad things, the myriad things receive it to wax and wane, fill and empty. Its boundary cannot be exhausted—this is roaming through the beginning and end of the myriad things. Inwardly able to dwell and conceal, outwardly able to roam among things—this is the perfection and fullness of the Dao.\n\nUnify their nature, nurture their qi, contain their virtue, and thereby connect with the source of things.\n\nA commentary states: Unifying their nature prevents division; nurturing their qi prevents depletion; containing their virtue prevents dispersion. Thus, they can ascend and roam with the Creator—this is what is meant by connecting with the source of things. Those who are thus have their heavenly endowment intact, their spirit unobstructed—how could things enter them?\n\nA commentary states: From what could things arise? How could uprightness emerge? Roaming through the beginning and end of the myriad things, they connect with the source of things. Connecting with the source of things, they attain heaven; attaining heaven, they attain spirit. Their heavenly endowment intact, their spirit has no division. With their spirit undivided, the preservation of pure qi is firmly established—thus, nothing can enter them.\n\nWhen a drunkard falls from a cart, though the speed be great, he does not die. His bones and joints are the same as others’, yet the harm he suffers differs—his spirit is whole. He does not know he is riding, nor does he know he has fallen. Life and death, alarm and fear do not enter his breast; thus, he does not tremble before things. If one can be whole through wine and yet be thus, how much more so when whole through heaven? The sage conceals himself in heaven—thus, nothing can harm him.\n\nA commentary states: Spirit gives life to form, and form completes spirit. Without spirit, form cannot live; without form, spirit cannot be realized. For spirit to remain whole and undiminished, its loss comes from knowledge. For form to remain whole and unharmed, its injury comes from resisting things. Yet spirit gives life to form—those who cherish their form do not necessarily preserve their spirit, but when spirit is preserved, nothing can resist it. The drunkard on the cart, unaware of riding or falling—this is how his spirit remains whole. With spirit whole, life and death, alarm and fear cannot move his center. Though he falls from the cart, it can only harm his form, not his spirit—this is why his harm differs from others’, and though the speed be great, he does not die. Yet being whole through wine is merely drowning in intoxication and confusing one’s knowledge—it is not knowledge that forgets emotion. As for sobriety, knowledge remains clear and never forgotten for a moment—thus, though he does not die, he may still suffer harm. But if true knowledge is without knowledge, then even water and fire cannot scorch or drown, let alone a fall from a cart. This is how being whole through heaven means nothing can harm one. The sage conceals himself in this—this is the way of long life and enduring vision.\n\nLiezi drew his bow to the full for Bohun Wuren, placing a cup of water on his elbow and loosing the arrow. The arrowhead followed in succession, and the next arrow found its place. At that moment, he was like a wooden figure.\n\nBohun Wuren said: *\"This is the shooting of one who shoots, not the shooting of one who does not shoot. Try standing with me atop a high mountain, treading on perilous rocks, facing an abyss of a hundred fathoms—could you shoot then?\"*\n\nThereupon, Wuren ascended the high mountain, trod on perilous rocks, faced the hundred-fathom abyss, and turned his back, hesitating, with two parts of his feet hanging over the edge. He beckoned Liezi forward. Liezi prostrated himself on the ground, sweating to his heels.\n\nBohun Wuren said: *\"The perfected person gazes above into the blue sky, plunges below into the yellow springs, roams to the eight limits, yet their spirit and qi remain unchanged. Now you tremble with fear in your eyes—your center is in peril.\"*\n\nA commentary states: *\"Drew his bow to the full\"* means he drew it to the arrowhead’s limit. *\"Placing a cup of water on his elbow\"* means his stance was steady and precise. *\"The arrowhead followed in succession\"* means his skill was exact. *\"The next arrow found its place\"* means his shooting was swift.\n\nThe reason he could do this was that his intent remained undivided, like a wooden figurine. Yet this is the archery of archery, not the archery of non-archery. In the archery of archery, what one aims for lies without; in the archery of non-archery, what one holds fast to lies within. The archery of archery may or may not succeed; the archery of non-archery admits no success or failure. When one is like a wooden figurine, there is nothing to fear without. The reason he prostrated himself and sweated was that his heart clung to something. The mountain’s height, the rock’s peril, the abyss’s depth—none of these harbored intent to harm; not all who climb or tread encounter disaster. It is only because of clinging to life, submitting outwardly to pride and stinginess, that one goes to every extreme. In the end, things cannot harm me, but my own heart harms itself, leading to the loss of life without ever awakening.\n\nAs for the perfected person, who does not depart from the true, their climbing and treading differ not from others’—only their spirit and qi are inwardly guarded. They do not know the height or depth to be feared, and wherever they go, they remain like a wooden figurine. They roam to the eight limits, yet their spirit and qi remain unchanged—nothing more.\n\nLiezi once rode the wind to travel—what difficulty would he have in advancing this Way? The text speaks thus to urge learners not to regard flattery and fame as the world’s highest beauty, all contained within themselves, but to devote themselves to wholeness. Confucius did not claim his sageliness—it was like this as well.\n\nAs for Bohun Wuren, he dwelled at the head of things, turning clarity into obscurity, and became a person of non-being. This is how he could ascend heights and face depths without fear—this was the teaching Liezi received.\n\nThe Fan clan had a son named Zihua, who was skilled at cultivating his private reputation. The entire state submitted to him; he was favored by the Lord of Jin yet held no office, ranking above the Three Ministers. Whatever he glanced at, the state of Jin ennobled; whatever he spoke of, the state of Jin demoted. Those who frequented his courtyard filled the court. Zihua sent his knights to attack one another with cunning and vulgarity, to oppress the weak with the strong. Though they were wounded before him, he paid no heed. Day and night, he made this his sport and pleasure, until the state nearly became a custom.\n\nWhen He Sheng and Zi Bo—both esteemed guests of the Fan clan—went on a journey, they passed through the fields outside the village and lodged at the hut of Tian Geng, a field warden named Shang Qiu Kai. In the dead of night, He Sheng and Zi Bo spoke to each other of Zihua’s fame and power, how he could make the living perish and the dead live, the rich poor and the poor rich. Shang Qiu Kai, who had long suffered from hunger and cold, secretly listened from behind the north window. Thereupon, he borrowed grain and carried a basket to Zihua’s gate.\n\nIt is said: He Sheng and Zi Bo were both high-ranking guests of the Fan clan, so their knowledge of the clan’s fame and power was precise. That they spoke of Zihua’s influence in the middle of the night shows they were not boasting to others. Shang Qiu Kai, who overheard from beside the window, knew their words were unintentional and not false. Thus, taking their words as truth, he feared only that sincerity might fall short or action might not keep pace. Zihua’s followers were all from noble families, clad in white silk, riding in carriages, walking with slow steps and haughty gazes. When they saw Shang Qiu Kai—old, frail, dark-faced, and careless in dress—they all sneered at him. Soon, they grew familiar, mocking and deceiving him, pushing and shoving, doing whatever they pleased. Shang Qiu Kai never showed anger, and the guests’ tricks soon wore thin, their jesting exhausted.\n\nIt is said: Zihua’s followers took their mockery and deceitful tricks as amusement, seeking to outdo each other and humiliate others. Had Shang Qiu Kai taken their insults as lies and resented them, Zihua’s ambitions would have soared while Shang Qiu Kai would have truly been shamed. But now, meeting them with sincerity and never showing anger, though their tricks were many, they soon grew feeble; though their laughter was merry, it soon tired. In the end, they could not shame Shang Qiu Kai. Looking back, were not their past mockery and jesting merely futile and self-humiliating? Thereupon, they ascended a high terrace with Shang Qiu Kai and, before the crowd, declared: “Whoever can leap down will be rewarded with a hundred gold pieces.” The crowd all clamored to respond. Shang Qiu Kai, taking their words as true, leapt first. His form was like a flying bird, soaring to the ground, yet his bones were nearly unharmed.\n\nIt is said: When suspicion and doubt vanish and sincerity is inwardly preserved, the body becomes weightless. Thus, his lightness resembled a bird’s flight from the high terrace, his bones nearly unscathed—just as a drunkard falls from a carriage, suffering harm differently from others. The Fan clan’s followers thought it a fluke and did not yet find it strange. Then, pointing to a secluded bend in the river, they said: “There is a treasure pearl within; you may dive to retrieve it.” Shang Qiu Kai dove again and, upon emerging, indeed found a pearl. The crowd began to doubt in unison. Zihua then ordered that he be given meat, fine clothes, and silk.\n\nIt is said: Believing their words and diving into the water without drowning—this was loyalty and trust placing his body amidst the waves. They deceived him into thinking there was a treasure pearl within; he dove and emerged, indeed finding a pearl. What principle was this? It was proof that sincerity can move things. Moreover, the treasure pearl, in its essence and wondrous use, becomes clearer the deeper one goes, present everywhere. Sought with cleverness or demanded with scorn, the loss grows greater. Only Shang Qiu Kai’s sincerity matched the formless, so how was his success any different?\n\nSoon after, a great fire broke out in the Fan clan’s treasury. Zihua said: “Whoever can enter the fire and retrieve brocade will be rewarded according to what they bring back.” Shang Qiu Kai went without hesitation, entering and exiting the flames unscathed—no dust clung to him, his body was not scorched. The Fan clan’s followers, believing him to possess the Dao, apologized together: “We did not know you possessed the Dao and deceived you; we did not know you were a divine person and humiliated you. You must think us fools, deaf, blind. We dare ask: what is your Dao?” Shang Qiu Kai replied: “I possess no Dao. Even my own heart does not know the reason. Nevertheless, there is one thing—I will try to tell you.”\n\nWhen the two guests you sent once lodged at my home, they extolled the power of the Fan clan, claiming it could make the living perish and the dead live, the rich poor and the poor rich. I believed them without doubt, so I came without hesitation. Upon arrival, I took your followers’ words as truth, fearing only that my sincerity might fall short or my actions prove insufficient. I knew not where to place my body or where profit and harm lay—my heart was simply one. When things do not resist, it is like this alone.\n\nNow that I know your followers deceived me, I harbor suspicion within and display arrogance without, clinging to past luck that spared me from burning or drowning. Yet my heart seethes with distress, trembling with fear. How could I dare approach water or fire again?\n\n**Explanation:** To dive and retrieve a treasure pearl is already strange, and the Fan clan’s followers grew wary and suspicious. Only after entering and exiting the fire unscathed—no dust clinging, no body scorched—did they deem him possessed of the Dao and call him a divine person. Yet this may be like tossing an object high without a stone to strike it, or merely coinciding with circumstances by chance. Emerging from water is something even a practiced swimmer can do, but fire, raging and fierce, consumes all—whether fine or coarse, soft or hard—reducing everything to ash in its flames. Unless one’s body harmonizes with the spirit and unites with the formless, how could a mere clod of earth dare approach firewood and flame?\n\nShang Qiu Kai said he possessed no Dao, and even his own heart did not know the reason. Only by forgetting emotions and attaining non-knowledge does the heart become one and undivided—this is the Dao, and nothing can resist it. But if one harbors suspicion and displays arrogance, distress seethes within, burning inner harmony, so how could one enter fire without scorching? Trembling with fear, one’s nature is drowned within, so how could one enter water without getting wet?\n\nAfter this, when the disciples of the Fan clan encountered beggars or horse doctors on the road, they dared not insult them but would alight from their carriages to bow. **Explanation:** Though Zi Hua’s fame and power made him disdain not even beggars or horse doctors, he recognized that fame and power were not the Dao. The noble person of great virtue appears foolish, and thus forgets his own status, daring not to insult even the lowly. This is the transformation wrought by utmost sincerity.\n\nI once said that when Shang Qiu Kai was sincere toward things without a divided heart, even the purest qi of a perfected person could not surpass him. But when he harbored suspicion and displayed arrogance, he was still one of the deluded masses. From this, we know the supreme Dao does not await external seeking, nor does attainment follow gradual steps. The difference between madness and sagehood lies solely in mastering one’s thoughts—whether distraction arises even for a moment. How could one not be cautious?\n\nZai Wo heard this and told Confucius. Confucius said: “Did you not know? The person of utmost sincerity can move things, stir heaven and earth, move ghosts and spirits, traverse the six directions without resistance—how could it be merely treading peril, entering water and fire?” **Explanation:** Facing others with sincerity is but a small, unproven trust. Sincerity without expectation is the purest trust, like unalloyed gold. The person of utmost sincerity does not doubt within or without, is utterly empty and unopposed, utterly pure and unadulterated. Thus they can partake in the vastness of heaven and earth, assist in their transformative nurturing. They can journey to the lands of the southern barbarians or reach even the lowliest creatures like pigs and fish—this is what is meant by stirring heaven and earth, moving ghosts and spirits, traversing the six directions without resistance.\n\nIf Weisheng drowned or Bao Jiao burned, was that the fault of sincerity? They blocked their own paths with false trust, not the utmost sincerity. If Shang Qiu Kai did not resist even when others deceived him, how much less would he resist when both sides were sincere? Remember this, young one.\n\n**Explanation:** When sincerity resides within, even false things become true; when delusion lingers inside, even favorable circumstances remain opposed. In dealing with oneself, one must focus solely on self-sincerity, and the sage’s skill in salvation aims only at mutual sincerity between self and other. As in the *Questions of Tang*, where the seed of immortals and sages flew back and forth between the five mountains in a single day or night—was this not mutual sincerity? To tell the young one to remember this is to say the Dao in a person knows no gap between youth and age. The young one should strive—why wait to hear the great Dao late in life?\n\nAs for the one called Zi Hua, his name means “glory without substance,” so it is fitting he would use fame and power to lord over others. *Shang* (merchant) suggests the gathering of sound, *qiu* (mound) the center rising from the earth, and *kai* (open) the emergence of things—thus “Shang Qiu Kai,” one who at first could enter water and fire, but in the end declared water and fire no longer approachable.\n\nKing Xuan of Zhou had a herdsman named Liang Yang, a laborer who could raise wild birds and beasts, feeding them in the palace gardens. Even tigers, wolves, eagles, and osprey became gentle—male and female before him, breeding in groups, different species living together without attacking or biting. The king, fearing the art would die with him, ordered Mao Qiu Yuan to learn it. Liang Yang said: “I am but a lowly laborer—what art could I teach you? I fear the king will think I am hiding it from you.” So he spoke briefly of his method for raising tigers: “All things with blood and qi rejoice when followed and rage when opposed—this is their nature. But when do joy and anger arise without cause? They are always provoked by opposition. When feeding a tiger, one must not give it live prey, lest it grow angry at having to kill, nor whole prey, lest it grow angry at having to tear it apart. One must time its hunger and satiety, understand its anger, and though tigers and humans are different species, they fawn on those who nurture them—this is following. To kill them is opposition.”\n\nThen how could I dare oppose them to provoke their anger? Yet neither do I follow them to elicit their joy. For joy inevitably gives way to anger, and anger in turn often yields to joy—both miss the mark. Now, my heart harbors neither opposition nor compliance, so that birds and beasts regard me as one of their own. Thus, those that roam my enclosures do not long for lofty forests or vast marshes; those that rest in my courtyard do not yearn for deep mountains or secluded valleys—this is the principle at work.\n\n**Explanation:** All living things possess the nature of blood and qi. From a human perspective, blood is stored in the heart, while qi resides in the lungs; qi moves, and blood follows. In a single day and night, there are thirteen thousand five hundred breaths, with blood and qi circulating ceaselessly—awake, they course through the body; asleep, they flow through the organs. Not a hair’s breadth of delay is permitted: too much or too little, and illness arises; if severe, death follows. Thus, blood and qi may be followed but never opposed.\n\nFrom this nature of blood and qi arise the conditions of opposition and compliance, giving rise to the emotions of joy and anger. Resentment and gratitude, life and death—nothing is beyond their reach. Yet though humans cannot reverse their qi, they can command it; though they cannot defy their nature, they can regulate it—this is what makes humans possessors of the Dao. Even with the emotions of joy and anger, their expression never fails to strike the proper measure.\n\nAs for the creatures that fly and burrow, those with wings and horns, fangs and claws, that soar or crawl—knowing only the advantage of life, they are ruled by blood and qi. Thus, birds at their limit snatch, and beasts at their limit strike. To expect them to be docile among humans, living together without attacking or devouring one another—is this not difficult? Yet even tigers and wolves, eagles and ospreys—the fiercest of birds and beasts—share the same blood and qi as humans, so their minds and intelligence are not so far removed from ours. If one can understand their desires, time their hunger and satiety, indulge their compliance without violating their opposition, there is none that cannot be tamed.\n\nMoreover, to comprehend their joy and anger and indulge them—this is the art of nurturing them. But the essence of why they can stand before you, male and female, breeding in groups, different species living together without attacking or devouring one another—lies in the heart that harbors neither opposition nor compliance. Why? Understanding their joy and anger does not make them forget joy and anger. Joy and anger alternate like the movement of yin and yang: to oppose and provoke them is certainly impermissible, but to follow and indulge them is also not the mean. Though one may temporarily follow them to elicit joy, in the end, some violation will inevitably provoke their anger. Only when joy and anger do not manifest, and one harbors no opposition or compliance toward things, do things likewise harbor no opposition or compliance toward oneself. Thus, birds and beasts regard me as one of their own.\n\nThe reason birds and beasts scatter in alarm, fleeing and hiding, seeking only lofty forests, vast marshes, deep mountains, and secluded valleys is to avoid harm and remain with their kind. Now, regarding me as one of their own, they roam my gardens, rest in my courtyard, live alongside humans, walk beside them—what joy is this! Why would they seek the seclusion of mountains and forests or crave the peril of rivers and valleys? With no opposition or compliance in me, the subtlety of non-action and non-utterance silently prevails even over the fiercest of creatures. Those with horns are transformed and tamed—this may be called subtle indeed.\n\nKing Xuan of Zhou valued Liang Yang’s art and transmitted it, yet when it came to governance, he still conducted censuses of the people without applying this art—how profoundly he failed to reflect! If he had used this Dao to shepherd his people, achieving a world at ease and a society of contentment would have been effortless.\n\nAs for \"Liang Yang\": *Yang* is a paired bird, naturally docile and sociable; *Liang Yang* thus refers to one that advances and finds its place in the rafters. As for \"Mao Qiu Yuan\": *Qiu Yuan* suggests a place where feathered creatures thrive, a land of nourishment where they delight to dwell. This is why Liang Yang could raise wild birds and beasts, and why King Xuan ordered Mao Qiu Yuan to transmit his art.\n\nYan Yuan asked Confucius: “I once crossed the Shentang Abyss, where the ferryman handled the boat as if by divine skill. I asked him, ‘Can one learn to handle a boat?’ He said, ‘Yes—those who can swim can be taught. Those skilled at swimming can learn quickly. As for divers, they have never seen a boat yet handle it with ease.’ I asked him further, but he did not explain. May I ask what this means?”\n\nConfucius said: “Speaking of medicine, you and I have long studied its texts, yet we have not grasped its essence—shall we now discuss the Way? Those who can swim may be taught, for they are light upon the water; those skilled at swimming master it swiftly, for they have forgotten the water. As for divers, though they have never seen a boat, they handle it with ease—this is because they see the abyss as level ground, and a capsized boat as no different from a cart overturned. Though ten thousand scenes of overturning lie before them, they do not enter their minds; where could they not act with leisure?\n\nExplanation: Water bears the boat—those who learn to steer should know this fundamental principle. One may study the ferryman’s skill in handling a boat yet fail to learn what makes him a ferryman. Even the ferryman’s finest techniques can only transmit his methods, not exhaust his artistry. Those practiced in water and bold in swimming, though untrained in steering, may match the ferryman’s skill. For one unpracticed in water gazes at the river’s edge with trepidation and dread, fearing only drowning—how then could they steer a boat? Thus, those light upon the water may be taught, and those who forget the water master it swiftly. As for divers, they have never seen a boat yet handle it with ease. Never having seen a boat, they have not only forgotten the water but even the boat itself—thus they act with leisure in all things.\n\nCrossing water is like traversing peril; governing the world is like steering a boat to ferry the people to a place without difficulty. Only those who embody the Way can lightly forget worldly affairs, moving through ten thousand changes without ever being obstructed—thus they act with leisure in saving the world. Yan Hui’s use and withdrawal, action and concealment, were the same as the sage’s, so Confucius discussed the essence with him after exploring the texts.\n\nOne who pries with clay is skillful; with a hook, hesitant; with gold, dull. The skill is the same, yet attachment to externals makes one weigh them heavily. All who weigh externals neglect what lies within.\n\nExplanation: The more one values the object, the more the mind becomes constrained; a constrained mind dulls wisdom and loses skill. Skill resides within, while things lie without. Once skillful, attachment to externals makes one clumsy—why not settle the distinction between inner and outer? Treat gold as mere tile, and one will be skillful in all things, for what one values cannot then leave oneself. Yet this cannot be forced—only those who embody the Way act thus naturally.\n\nAt first, one may be skillful, but in the end, clumsy—thus skill turns to clumsiness. If one’s cunning and skill were absent, the weight of what one values would not be seen, and in handling affairs, one might not be unskillful. Then is not what the world calls skill truly great clumsiness? Thus, great skill appears as clumsiness.\n\n*Explication of the Perfect Virtue of the Dao and Its Power, Scroll Three—Concluded*\n*Explication of the Perfect Virtue of the Dao and Its Power, Scroll Four*\n\nA student of the Inner College of Hangzhou Prefecture Academy, your subject Jiang Yu respectfully presents:\n\nThe Yellow Emperor and Confucius observed at Lüliang, where the water plunged from a height of thirty *ren*, its surging foam stretching thirty *li*, a place where soft-shelled turtles, alligators, fish, and turtles could not swim. Yet they saw a man swimming there. Believing him to be in distress and seeking death, they sent their disciples downstream to rescue him. After several hundred paces, the man emerged, his hair unbound, singing as he swam along the embankment. (The text should read \"beneath the embankment\" rather than \"along the mulberry path.\")\n\nConfucius followed and questioned him: \"At Lüliang, the water falls thirty *ren*, its foam surges thirty *li*, a place where soft-shelled turtles, alligators, fish, and turtles cannot swim. When I saw you entering it, I thought you were in distress and wished to die, so I sent my disciples downstream to assist you. Yet you emerged with your hair unbound, singing as you swam—at first, I took you for a ghost, but upon closer inspection, you are a man. May I ask if you have a method for treading water?\"\n\nThe man replied: \"No, I have no method. I began with what was familiar, grew with my nature, and fulfilled my destiny. I enter the water with the current and emerge with its flow. I follow the Way of water without imposing my own will—this is how I swim.\"\n\nConfucius asked: \"What do you mean by beginning with what was familiar, growing with your nature, and fulfilling your destiny?\"\n\nThe man said: \"I was born on the hills and am at ease on the hills—this is what is familiar. I grew up in the water and am at ease in the water—this is my nature. I do not know why I am thus, yet I am thus—this is destiny.\"\n\n*Explication*: Creatures born in water do not struggle against its nature, just as humans are born on land and are at ease there. Yet this old man from Lüliang could swim where soft-shelled turtles, alligators, fish, and turtles could not—this was a particular ability of his nature. Only by possessing such a nature could he grow up in the water and be at ease in it. Though at ease in the water, if he did not reach the point of not knowing why he was thus, he would not yet be following the Way of water without imposing his own will, and his skill would not be so wondrous. Thus, his words ultimately speak of destiny. Such a man is like one of whom Zhuangzi spoke, who had attained the ability to roam great rivers.\n\nWhen Confucius traveled to Chu, he came upon a hunchback in the forest who caught cicadas as easily as if plucking them. Confucius said: \"You are skillful! Do you have a method?\"\n\nThe man replied: \"I do have a method.\"\n\nIn the fifth or sixth month, when I stack two pellets and they do not fall, I miss only a few; when I stack three and they do not drop, I miss one in ten; when I stack five and they do not fall, it is as if I were gathering them by hand. My stance is like a withered tree stump; my arm, like a dead branch. Though heaven and earth are vast and the myriad things many, I know only the cicada’s wings. I do not turn aside, nor do I let the myriad things distract me from the cicada’s wings—how could I fail to catch them?\n\nConfucius turned to his disciples and said: \"When the will is undivided, it coalesces into spirit.\" Is this not what the hunchbacked elder means?\n\nThe elder said: \"You, a scholar in fine robes, what do you know of such matters? First refine what you practice, then you may speak of it.\"\n\nExplanation: To learn cicada-catching by stacking pellets—the pellet, being round, rolls and turns without fixed inclination. If one can stack them without their falling, one’s bodily stillness, the precision of one’s grip, and the undivided focus of one’s will are already evident. With such mastery, catching cicadas is as easy as plucking them. Since the cicada’s wings are light and swift, to take them so effortlessly is to advance beyond mere skill—how could this belong to the realm of cleverness? Thus he says, \"I have a method.\"\n\nWhen his stance is like a withered tree stump and his arm like a dead branch, he has inwardly forgotten himself. When he does not let the myriad things distract him from the cicada’s wings, he has outwardly forgotten all else. With both self and things forgotten, how could he fail in catching cicadas? Thus Confucius said his will was undivided, coalescing into spirit. A divided will dissipates spirit; an undivided will concentrates it—this is what is meant by \"guarding the pure qi.\" Such is the way of the hunchbacked elder, whose form was bent yet who sought no external refinement.\n\nConfucius, by contrast, wore fine robes and cultivated the conduct of a Ru scholar in Lu. Thus the elder urged him to refine what he applied in the world and set it aside before speaking of such matters.\n\nThe cicada, as a creature, shuns filth, seeks purity, sings in season, eats nothing, and makes no demands. Those who have attained the Dao of bodily transformation find in it a fitting symbol for their practice.\n\nThere was a man by the sea who loved gulls. Each morning he went to the shore, and the gulls followed him, flocking in hundreds. His father said: \"I hear the gulls all follow you—bring some back, and I will play with them.\" The next day, when he went to the shore, the gulls danced above but would not descend.\n\nThus it is said: \"The highest words abandon words; the highest action is non-action.\" The knowledge of those who rely on cleverness is shallow indeed.\n\nExplanation: The Classic says: \"Once there is a deluded mind, it startles the spirit.\" Mind and spirit are as exterior and interior. If I startle my spirit, things will startle me in return. The man by the sea followed the gulls because his mind held no resistance. Once he harbored the thought of capturing them, he startled his spirit—hence the gulls danced above and would not descend. If one does not oppose things, all things will respond likewise—why only gulls? It was only because his fondness was for gulls that the gulls followed him.\n\nThough gulls and humans are different species, when the human mind is wordless and actionless, it is closely observed by them. Then what need is there for words to be trusted or actions to be known? The knowledge of those who rely on cleverness is truly shallow.\n\nWhen Liezi offered five jugs of wine first, it startled the recipient. When Viscount Xiang of Zhao led a hundred thousand followers to hunt in Zhongshan, they set fire to the forest, fanning flames across a hundred li. A man emerged from a stone cliff, rising and falling with the smoke and embers. The crowd called him a ghostly being. When the fire passed, he walked out unhurriedly, as if untouched by what he had endured.\n\nViscount Xiang, astonished, detained him and observed him closely: his form, complexion, and seven orifices were human; his breath and voice were human. He asked: \"By what way did you dwell in stone? By what way did you enter fire?\"\n\nThe man replied: \"What do you mean by 'stone'? What do you mean by 'fire'?\"\n\nViscount Xiang said: \"What you just emerged from was stone; what you just passed through was fire.\"\n\nThe man said: \"I do not know.\"\n\nExplanation: What binds me to things, and what enables things to bind me, is the separation of form, preventing great unity. Things and I are not fundamentally different—our differences arise from knowledge and perception. Thus, knowing something as stone makes its hardness impenetrable; knowing it as fire makes its heat unapproachable. Yet the burning of fire and the hardness of stone cannot be ignored by those who are utterly without knowledge. Only when one knows through non-knowing, remaining serene and leaving no trace in the mind, do flesh and bone dissolve, merging into great unity. In great unity without self, nothing can obstruct one.\n\nHere, a man emerges from a stone cliff, rising and falling with smoke and embers. When asked about his way of dwelling in stone and entering fire, he does not know—not only does he not know the way, he has even forgotten stone and fire. This is true non-knowing. Then what can stone or fire obstruct?\n\nWhen Marquis Wen of Wei heard of this, he asked Zixia: \"What sort of man is he?\"\n\nZixia replied: \"From what I have heard of the Master’s words, one who harmonizes attains great unity with things, so that nothing can harm him. Such a one may wander through metal and stone, tread through water and fire.\"\n\nThe marquis said: \"Why do you not do this?\"\n\nZixia said: \"To hollow out the heart and discard knowledge—I have not yet attained this. Still, I can speak of it when there is leisure.\"\n\nThe marquis said: \"Why does the Master not do this?\"\n\nZixia said: \"The Master is capable of it but chooses not to.\"\n\nThe marquis was greatly pleased.\n\nA commentary states: When affirmation and negation complement each other, this is called harmony. To be obstructed by being is not harmony; to conceal oneself in non-being is also not harmony. For non-being is inaction and not principle, while being is obstruction and not the Dao. Only when one neither discards the function of being and non-being yet transcends both can one attain great unity with things.\n\nThis great unity means unifying through difference. When difference unifies, nothing is destroyed. The hardness of stone and the fierceness of fire cannot obstruct me. This is the Dao—what Zixia heard from the Master. Though Zixia himself has not yet hollowed out his heart and discarded knowledge, he still has leisure to speak of this. How much more so the Master?\n\nThat the Master does not practice this is not because he cannot, but because he chooses not to. Those who cannot, of course, do not practice it. But those who can yet cannot refrain from practicing it are controlled by their own ability and thus cannot truly do it. Only one who can practice yet does not, or practices without knowing why, is free from all inability.\n\nI have often reflected: The man of Zhao who entered stone and fire did so because he did not know. Yet even grasses and trees, which lack knowledge, cannot avoid being scorched or drowned in water and fire, nor obstructed by metal and stone. This is because all things are bound to the Five Phases—wood bends, water weakens, metal hardens, fire blazes, earth balances—and spread through mutual generation, completion, restraint, and control. How can they escape transformation?\n\nHumans are the spirit of the myriad things, endowed with the qi of harmonious balance. They can embody heaven and earth, yin and yang. What is called \"not knowing\" in them is not the same as the ignorance of things. By embracing harmony and guarding qi, they merge with the myriad things without perceiving difference. Then how could metal and stone, water and fire, ever obstruct their passage?\n\nLook to the creatures of the world: birds soaring in the clouds, fish lurking in the depths, insects nesting in wood, rats moving through fire—all are manifestations of yin and yang. If those who grasp only one aspect of yin and yang can do such things, how much more the sage who unifies with yin and yang, holding creation within himself? He finds fulfillment in all things without needing to act to prove it.\n\nA spirit-medium from Qi arrived in Zheng, named Ji Xian. He could foretell a person’s death or survival, fortune or misfortune, longevity or early demise, predicting the year, month, ten-day period, or day with divine accuracy. When the people of Zheng saw him, they all fled. Liezi met him and was enchanted. Returning, he told Hujiaozi: \"I once thought your Dao was supreme, but now I see there is something even greater.\"\n\nA commentary states: In ancient times, when people’s essence and spirit were undivided, gods would descend upon them. Among men, such a one was called a *wu* (medium), and if skilled in the Dao, a *shenwu* (divine medium). Named Ji Xian, he was one who had awakened to the Dao in youth. His mastery of the Dao allowed him to see clearly into others, while his youthful sensitivity left no emotion hidden. All beings confined to form are deluded by the calculations of life and death, fortune and misfortune, longevity and early demise. Yet Ji Xian could foresee these before they occurred—this is what the ignorant call the ultimate attainment.\n\nHujiaozi said: \"I have shown you the outward form of the Dao, but not its true substance. Can one truly be said to have attained the Dao if one is like a flock of hens without a rooster—how could they produce eggs? If you set the Dao against the world, you will surely be exposed. That is why he could read your fate.\"\n\nA commentary states: Form is the manifestation of affairs; substance is the reality of the Dao. To have form without substance is like having hens without a rooster—how can one lead all things and transform the myriad beings? Liezi set the Dao against the world, so his fate was certain and his exposure inevitable. Since he had grasped Hujiaozi’s outward form but not his true substance, how could he escape detection?\n\n\"Bring him to me and let him observe me.\"\n\nThe next day, Liezi brought Ji Xian to see Hujiaozi. Afterward, Ji Xian said to Liezi: \"Alas! Your master is dead. He cannot live. He will not last ten days. I saw something strange—like damp ashes.\"\n\nLiezi entered, weeping so that his tears soaked the bedding, and told Hujiaozi. Hujiaozi said: \"Earlier, I showed him the pattern of earth—stillness without movement. This is likely what Zhuangzi called the *Dudeji* (Virtue Concealed). Bring him again.\"\n\nThe next day, Liezi brought Ji Xian to see Hujiaozi again. Afterward, Ji Xian said to Liezi: \"Fortunate that your master met me! He is recovering. There is life in the ashes. I saw the *Duquan* (Virtue Balanced).\"\n\nLiezi entered and told Hujiaozi. Hujiaozi said: \"Earlier, I showed him the pattern of heaven and earth—where names and realities do not enter, yet vitality stirs from the heels. This is the *Duquan*. He likely saw the *Shanzheji* (Virtue at Ease). Bring him again.\"\n\nThe next day, Liezi brought Ji Xian to see Hujiaozi again. Afterward, Ji Xian said to Liezi: \"Your master is not in a state of fasting. I cannot read him. Let him fast, and at dawn I will observe him again.\"\n\nLiezi entered and told Hujiaozi. Hujiaozi said: \"Earlier, I showed him the *Taichong Mozhen* (Great Vacuity Without Trace). This is likely what I call the *Hengqiji* (Qi Balanced). When the *ni* fish swims in a whirlpool, it forms a deep pool; when still water swirls, it forms a deep pool; when flowing water swirls, it forms a deep pool; when overflowing water swirls, it forms a deep pool; when soaking water swirls, it forms a deep pool; when rushing water swirls, it forms a deep pool; when dammed water swirls, it forms a deep pool; when gushing water swirls, it forms a deep pool; when spring water swirls, it forms a deep pool—these are the Nine Abysses.\n\nBring him again.\"\n\nThe next day, Liezi brought Ji Xian to see Hujiaozi again.\n\nHe had not yet steadied himself when he lost his composure and fled. Hujiaozi said: \"Pursue him.\" Liezi chased after him but could not catch up. Returning, he reported to Hujiaozi: \"He has vanished, he is gone—I could not reach him.\"\n\nHujiaozi said: \"Earlier, I showed him what had never yet departed from my source. I moved with him in emptiness and marvelous transformation, so that he knew not who or what I was. Taking me for drifting reeds, taking me for flowing waves, he fled.\"\n\nThe explanation states: What is shown lies with me; what is perceived lies with him. Where there is something shown, there must be something seen. When I showed him the patterns of earth, which incline toward yin, unmoved by shock, unstilled by quietude, he saw my virtue’s subtle stirrings sealed and unexpressed—thus he deemed me lifeless. When I showed him heaven and earth, which incline toward yang, though name and reality did not enter, there was still an \"I\"; though the subtle stirrings of qi outwardly manifested, their rest was profound—thus he saw my virtue emerge as goodness and deemed me alive. What is called \"sealed potential\" is this: at first, he saw only the patterns of earth, unaware that these were the sealed stirrings of virtue. Only upon seeing heaven and earth did he then take those sealed stirrings as mere expedience, fitting for the moment.\n\nWhen I showed him the *Taichong Mozhen* (Great Vacuity Without Trace), perfect harmony surged forth, its bounds unfathomable; the subtle stirrings of qi remained ever-balanced, filling heaven and earth, responding to the myriad changes without ever being disturbed. His abiding in the stillness of the abyss is like the nine abysses of water—thus Ji Xian could find nothing to perceive in me. The nine abysses are the nature of water without human artifice. Though it bends or straightens with the land, takes shape with its vessel, swirls or stills, flows or overflows, rushes downward or seeps sideways, pools and returns, or bursts forth and streams away—though its waves transform ninefold—it remains ever-abyssal and self-possessed. When the Dao reaches this point, one enters the realm of neither death nor life. What Ji Xian knew was only life after birth—how could he fathom this?\n\nYet even the *Taichong Mozhen* still lodges in qi to reveal its subtleties. When I showed him what had never yet departed from my source, he became one who, though human, could act as heaven; though responding to the myriad things, remained deeply rooted in tranquil extremity. This is why Ji Xian lost himself and fled, and why Liezi could not catch up. The false before the true is like snow and frost melting at the sight of sunlight—thus he said, \"He has vanished, he is gone.\"\n\nMoreover, what had never yet departed from my source still did not leave the source, yet there was still something shown. For even the subtlest Dao does not fail to reveal itself—like sunlight shining everywhere, if the blind do not see, can the fault lie with the sun?\n\nThe one called Hujiaozi took emptiness as his essence and dwelt in a lofty central place. Dwelling in the center and on high, he seemed approachable, yet with emptiness as his essence, he never contended with the world—this is why none could fathom him.\n\nAfterward, Liezi, believing he had never yet begun to learn, returned home. For three years he did not go out, cooked for his wife, and ate gruel as if feeding others. He grew indifferent to affairs, polished no more but returned to simplicity, stood alone in his form like an uncarved block, and guarded his heart with vigilance. Thus he ended his days.\n\nThe explanation states: \"For three years he did not go out\"—he cut off from things. \"Cooked for his wife and ate gruel as if feeding others\"—he forgot himself. \"Indifferent to affairs\"—he abandoned cunning and habit. \"Polished no more but returned to simplicity, stood alone in his form\"—he returned to his mandate, reverted to constancy, and let his true singularity shine. \"Guarded his heart with vigilance\"—though the myriad changes swirled, he kept to the constant path. \"Thus he ended his days\"—this endured through ten thousand generations unchanged.\n\nLiezi advanced in this Dao, intending to show others how to return to the root—hence these words.\n\nOn his way to Qi, Liezi turned back mid-journey and encountered Bohun Maoren. Bohun Maoren asked: \"Why have you returned?\" Liezi replied: \"I was startled. Why should I be startled?\"\n\n\"I dined at ten porridge-stalls, yet five served me first.\" Bohun Maoren said: \"If this is so, why then are you startled?\"\n\nLiezi replied: \"When inner sincerity is not dissolved, the body’s demeanor radiates light, and this outward bearing overawes others’ hearts, making them slight the noble and the aged, and correct what troubles them. Now, these porridge-sellers merely trade in gruel for profit, with no great surplus gain; their advantage is meager, their influence slight—yet even so they act thus. How much more so with a lord of ten thousand chariots, who wearies himself for the state and exhausts his wisdom on affairs? He will entrust me with tasks and demand results from me. This is why I am startled.\"\n\nBohun Maoren explained: \"Human nature is like water: frozen, it becomes ice; melted, it returns to water. Frozen, its form does not change; melted, its use is inexhaustible. The perfected person’s heart is vast as ice about to melt, reverting to its clarity—how could it be overawed by external radiance? But if one inwardly prides oneself on true wisdom, unable to dissolve the entanglements of things, then one’s demeanor becomes twisted and gleams with false light. Others can then scrutinize it closely, and even those as slight in power and profit as porridge-sellers will slight the noble and the aged, and meddle in what troubles them. *Chì* means disorder, referring to the many troubles that arise. Qi is a central state, a place where tasks are assigned and achievements demanded. Thus Liezi, on his way to Qi, was startled by the five porridge-sellers’ precedence and turned back mid-journey.\n\nYet this startlement differs from the so-called ‘startlement at favor and disgrace.’\"\n\nBohun Maoren said: \"Excellent is your observation! If you abide in yourself, others will safeguard you.\"\n\nNot long after, when he went to visit, the shoes outside the door were filled to overflowing.\n\nBohun Maoren explained: \"To be startled by five porridge-sellers serving first is to be adept at inward observation. ‘Abiding in oneself’ means not neglecting one’s form—this is why the shoes outside the door were so many.\"\n\nBohun Maoren stood facing north, leaning heavily on his staff and pressing it against his chin. After standing thus for a while, he departed without a word. The attendant informed Liezi, who rushed barefoot, holding his shoes, and upon reaching the gate asked: \"Master, since you have come, have you not neglected your medicine?\"\n\nBohun Maoren explained: \"Standing facing north is to discern things. Leaning on his staff and pressing it to his chin is to forget himself. Departing without a word is to forget speech and discernment. Liezi, holding his shoes and rushing barefoot, has not yet silently grasped the wordless teaching; he is quick in seeking the Dao but forgets his feet. Moreover, rushing barefoot shows he has already strayed from ‘abiding in himself.’ The *Zhuangzi*’s *Virtue Complete and Perfect* repeatedly mentions the toe-less and the lame—perhaps this is akin to that.\"\n\nLiezi said: \"Enough. I had already told you: others will safeguard you. And indeed, they have safeguarded you.\"\n\nYou cannot make others safeguard you, yet you cannot prevent others from safeguarding you—why then this attachment to influence? Attachment breeds divergence. And if there must be influence, it unsettles your root and self—what meaning does it hold? Those who wander with you offer no true counsel; clinging to petty words poisons all. Neither awakened nor enlightened, how can they discern one another?\n\nBohun Maoren explained: One who does not lose their virtue yet has not attained the supreme virtue of non-virtue, who knows the Dao’s traces as something traversable yet has not reached the constant Dao’s effortless mind—such a one cannot prevent others from safeguarding them. And to fret over this inability to prevent safeguarding is already distinct from those who cause others to safeguard them. \"Attachment\" refers to preemptive action. Liezi never deliberately acted strangely to influence others, yet people were drawn to safeguard him—this must mean he unknowingly influenced them. Once influence takes hold, you exhaust your spirit, disturb your essence, and daily debate with those who leave their shoes at the door—what purpose does it serve? Thus it is said: unsettling your root and self holds no meaning. Those who wander with you are all mired in the exhaustion of human ways, so none can offer true counsel. Their petty chatter, though incessant, how can it serve as medicine for the ultimate teaching? In this state, they are all lost on the same path, where things and self remain unformed. Thus it is said: neither awakened nor enlightened, how can they discern one another?\n\nYang Zhu traveled south to Pei, while Lao Dan journeyed west to Qin, meeting by chance in the outskirts. By the time they reached Liang, they encountered the Old Master. Midway, the Old Master looked up to heaven and sighed: \"At first I thought you could be taught, but now you cannot.\" Yang Zhu did not respond. Upon reaching their lodging, he brought water for washing, a towel and comb, removed his shoes outside the door, and advanced on his knees, saying: \"Earlier, Master, you looked up to heaven and sighed, saying, ‘At first I thought you could be taught, but now you cannot.’ Your disciple wished to ask for your explanation, but your journey left no leisure, so I dared not. Now that you are at rest, may I inquire as to my fault?\"\n\nBohun Maoren explained: Confucius said, \"Unless one is a perfected person, one cannot humble oneself before others; and without humbling oneself, one cannot attain true understanding.\" Bringing water, washing, combing, removing shoes, and advancing on knees—all this was to seek true understanding. The Old Master said: \"Your gaze is haughty and overbearing—who could bear to dwell with you?\"\n\nBohun Maoren explained: Nothing in a person surpasses the eyes; the eyes cannot conceal their flaws, for they are separated into two orbs, the dwelling of the spirit. When those who have attained the Dao meet, their eyes meet and their intent is already conveyed. Those who know others often perceive truth in the space between brows and lashes. Thus Yang Zhu’s haughty and overbearing gaze, his improper vision, led the Old Master to deem him unteachable. Therefore, the *Book of the Yellow Emperor* says: \"The mechanism lies in the eyes.\" Utmost clarity appears as disgrace; abundant virtue seems insufficient.\n\nBohun Maoren explained: Comprehending all four directions is called utmost clarity. The more one lowers oneself, the more evident it becomes—this is what appears as disgrace. Empty yet never full, thus abundant virtue seems insufficient. One who embodies this meets others with a gaze so unassuming it seems not to see them at all—how could there be haughtiness or overbearingness? Yang Zhu, his expression suddenly transformed, said: \"I respectfully receive your instruction.\"\n\nOn his outward journey, when he stayed at an inn, the host welcomed him with the family, the master held the mat, the wife held the towel and comb, the guests yielded their seats, and those tending the stove withdrew. On his return, the inn’s guests vied with him for seats.\n\nBohun Maoren explained: Yielding a seat is not merely about non-contention. Vying for a seat is not merely about non-yielding. Upon hearing the teaching and returning, those who once yielded now contend. The distance between Qin and Liang is not great; the inn’s guests are the same as before, nor is there a second Yang Zhu. Yet their encounter changed so abruptly—one realizes then how the subtlest Dao operates in the ordinary, transforming form and altering perception, though people constantly rely on it without awareness. Traveling south to Pei, he hastened toward the convergence of things; on his return, he reverted to the root of his destiny. Whether yielding or contending depends solely on the direction of his journey.\n\nYang Zhu passed through Song and stayed at an inn on his way east. The innkeeper had two concubines—one beautiful, one ugly. The ugly one was honored, while the beautiful one was despised. Yang Zhu asked the reason. The innkeeper’s servant replied: \"The beautiful one is beautiful in her own eyes, but I do not see her beauty; the ugly one is ugly in her own eyes, but I do not see her ugliness.\" Yang Zhu said: \"Disciples, take note: act with worthiness but discard the conduct of self-regard—wherever you go, will you not be loved?\"\n\nBohun Maoren explained: Honoring the beautiful and despising the ugly stems from personal bias; honoring the ugly and despising the beautiful reflects the impartiality of the Dao. Beauty and ugliness arise from deluded perception; honoring and despising them are not true principles. What is despised in the innkeeper’s concubine is not her beauty itself, but her reliance on it to be despised. What is honored in the innkeeper is not his ability to despise beauty, but his unawareness of it. If the innkeeper’s concubine did not rely on her beauty and lacked self-regarding conduct, there would be nowhere she would not be loved. The Old Master said: \"When all under heaven know beauty as beauty, ugliness arises.\" It is not that beauty is despised, but that knowing it as beauty is despised.\n\nUnder heaven, there are ways that always prevail and ways that do not always prevail. The way that always prevails is called softness; the way that does not always prevail is called strength. Both are known, yet people do not understand them. Thus the ancients said: \"Strength first appears in those not equal to oneself; when it reaches those equal to oneself, it is perilous. Softness first emerges from oneself; it is never perilous. With this, one prevails over individuals and multitudes alike. With this, one bears the world as if bearing nothing—this is called prevailing without striving to prevail, bearing without striving to bear.\"\n\nZhouzi said: \"To desire hardness, one must guard with softness; to desire strength, one must preserve with weakness. Accumulating softness yields hardness; accumulating weakness yields strength. Observe what is accumulated, and you will know the abode of fortune and misfortune. Strength prevails over those not equal to oneself, but when it reaches those equal to oneself, it is brittle. Softness prevails by emerging from oneself—its power is immeasurable.\"\n\nLao Dan said: \"When weapons are strong, they perish; when wood is strong, it breaks. The soft and weak are the companions of life; the hard and strong are the companions of death.\"\n\nExplanation: The soft and weak are the root of the Dao. Guarding the root of the Dao is nothing more than self-mastery, and thus there is nothing it does not overcome. With this, one overcomes the self; with this, one bears the world—secure and without peril, blessed and without misfortune. Though one has never sought to precede others, none can precede them. This is the way of those who skillfully nurture life, abiding as long as heaven and earth.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* says: \"Compliance is the means to exercise authority.\"\nZhuangzi says: \"In this, the fish finds its advantage.\"\nThis principle accords with the present teaching.\n\nThus, Laozi and Zhouzi, in their writings, repeatedly emphasize this intent. When they cite the words of high antiquity, it is to show that this Dao has endured since ancient times. Appearance need not be childlike for wisdom to be childlike; wisdom need not be childlike for appearance to be childlike. The sage embraces childlike wisdom and discards childlike appearance, while the multitude clings to childlike appearance and distances itself from childlike wisdom. Those whose appearance resembles their own, they draw near and love; those whose appearance differs, they distance and fear.\n\nA being with a seven-foot frame, differentiated hands and feet, hair on the head and teeth in the mouth, standing and moving—this is called a human. Yet humans are not without the hearts of beasts. Though they may possess the hearts of beasts, by appearance they are deemed kin. Creatures with wings and horns, fangs and claws spread wide, flying aloft or crouching to run—these are called birds and beasts. Yet birds and beasts are not without the hearts of humans. Though they may possess the hearts of humans, by appearance they are deemed distant.\n\nFu Xi, Nü Wa, Shennong, and the Xia sovereigns had serpent bodies and human faces, ox heads and tiger noses—these bore appearances unlike humans, yet possessed the great virtue of sages. Jie of Xia, Zhou of Yin, Duke Huan of Lu, and King Mu of Chu had the seven apertures of human features, identical to others in form, yet harbored the hearts of birds and beasts. Thus, the multitude, clinging to a single appearance in search of supreme wisdom, will never approach it.\n\nExplanation: The so-called \"appearances unlike humans\" refer to forms that closely resemble others—such as wasps with the eyes of weasels or jackals with the voices of wolves, tigers with swallow-like jaws—examples recorded in recent histories, available for verification. These words align with the marvels of creation, yet people, deluded by shallow understanding, fail to grasp the profundity of childlike wisdom.\n\nLiezi sought to clarify the ultimate Dao, and so spoke boldly, valuing only the truth of principle, heedless of the astonishment of the multitude. When the Yellow Emperor battled the Flame Emperor at the wilds of Banquan, he led bears, brown bears, wolves, leopards, lynxes, and tigers as his vanguard, while eagles, falcons, hawks, and kites served as his banners—this was commanding birds and beasts by force. When Yao entrusted Kui with music, striking and tapping stones, the hundred beasts danced in unison; when the nine movements of the *Xiaoshao* were complete, the phoenix came to pay homage—this was drawing birds and beasts by sound. If so, how do the hearts of birds and beasts differ from those of humans? Their forms and sounds differ from humans, yet people do not know the way to connect with them. The sage, knowing all and penetrating all, thus draws them forth and commands them.\n\nExplanation: Observing the nine movements of the *Xiaoshao* and the phoenix’s homage, we see that commanding birds and beasts by force is no falsehood. The wisdom of birds and beasts naturally aligns with that of humans in some respects. In ordering their lives, they do not borrow wisdom from humans: male and female pair, mother and child bond; they avoid level ground and seek perilous heights, shun cold and seek warmth; when dwelling, they form groups, when moving, they arrange in ranks; the small stay within, the strong guard without; when drinking, they lead one another, when eating, they call in flocks.\n\nIn the age of great antiquity, they dwelled alongside humans and walked among them. In the age of emperors and kings, they began to scatter in fear and confusion. By the degenerate age, they hid and fled, evading harm. Now, in the land of the Jie people to the east, there are those who frequently understand the speech of the six domestic animals—this is the achievement of partial wisdom. The divine sages of great antiquity fully knew the dispositions of all things and completely understood the sounds of different species. They gathered and assembled them, trained and instructed them, making them equal to humans. Thus, they first united with spirits and demons, then connected with the peoples of the eight directions, and finally gathered birds, beasts, insects, and moths. This shows that the hearts and minds of creatures with blood and qi are not so distant.\n\nThe divine sages, knowing this, left nothing untaught in their instruction.\n\nA commentary states: The stately strides of emperors and kings—whether the offices of the Yu clan or the courts of Tang and Wu—show that with each descending age, the Dao grows ever more constricted. In the time of great antiquity, birds and beasts dwelt alongside humans, walking among them without suspicion. As the ages declined and the Dao narrowed, they first grew startled and scattered, then fled and hid in concealment. That creatures of different kinds once lived and moved among humans—though this was so in the age of great antiquity—was also because the divine sages of that time had the means to gather and instruct them. Yet while the ages of past and present differ, how are the divine sages of old and present distinct? Later ages have also seen divine sages, yet we hear of none who gathered birds, beasts, insects, and moths to instruct them. Why is this? It is because the ages have declined, and creatures of different kinds, once startled, scattered, and hidden, can no longer be reassembled. Even with a sage ruler, one can only make birds, beasts, fish, and turtles docile. Thus, only when one has attained the age of a sage can one speak of the sage’s Way.\n\nIn Song there was a man called Master Ju, who loved macaques and kept them in troops. He understood their intentions, and they, in turn, grasped his. He reduced his household’s provisions to satisfy the macaques’ desires. Soon, however, he grew impoverished and sought to limit their food. Fearing the macaques would not submit, he first deceived them, saying: “Shall I give you taro—three in the morning and four at dusk—will that suffice?” The macaques all rose in anger. Then he said: “Shall I give you taro—four in the morning and three at dusk—will that suffice?” The macaques all prostrated themselves in delight. All things that are ensnared by cunning and baseness are like this. The sage, using wisdom to ensnare the multitude of fools, is no different from Master Ju using wisdom to ensnare his macaques. The name and reality remain unchanged, yet he makes them rejoice or rage at will.\n\nA commentary states: The use of joy and anger never hits the mark. Joy inevitably turns to anger, and anger invariably reverts to joy. When Master Ju allotted taro, the name and reality were not diminished. Seeking to limit their food, he made them prostrate in delight, but first had to deceive them into rising in anger—thus he ultimately achieved their joy. Had he immediately given them four in the morning and three at dusk, not only would he not have gained their joy, they would surely have risen in anger. Moreover, the macaques’ joy and anger were not feigned. The numbers three and four, whether combined or separated, still make seven. Considering the macaques’ minds, they would rather eat more in the morning and less at dusk. Thus, the abundance or scarcity in morning and dusk—how could joy and anger not be employed?\n\nIt has been said that since the Great Simplicity divided, it transformed into seven—the numbers of heaven (three) and earth (four), one odd and one even, giving birth and completing all things. Nothing escapes this number. Those who do not understand it are enslaved by it; those not deluded by it can wield it. This is not only true of the macaques’ joy and anger. The governance of hegemons through pleasure and indulgence is deemed shameful at the gates of sages because they ensnare with cunning and baseness. Not only is this true of hegemons’ governance—even the sage’s response to emperors and kings cannot escape using the world as a cage. The difference lies only in their subtle and wondrous use of numbers, hence the depth or shallowness of their governance’s effects. Pushing this to its extreme, even the transformations of heaven and earth—day and night, waking and dreaming, cold and heat, death and life—cannot alter the number of the Great Expansion’s seven times seven, leaving one void. Thus, to call the macaques’ joy and anger delusion is to call all things delusion. To deem human joy and anger correct—how can the macaques’ joy and anger alone be wrong? People laugh at the macaques ensnared by Master Ju, yet they themselves have often been in cages without realizing it and thus do not laugh—this, too, is delusion. Therefore, for humans to laugh at macaques is like the *Mencius*’s analogy of the fifty-pace soldier mocking the hundred-pace one.\n\nMoreover, the macaque is a creature skilled in its cunning, relying on its agility, and difficult to tame. Yet it is deluded by the alternating numbers of three and four and does not awaken—how much more so for other creatures? This may be why Liezi specifically took up the meaning of Master Ju’s taro allotment. Nevertheless, Master Ju, by reducing his household’s provisions to the point of poverty, had no choice but to limit the macaques’ food. From this, we know that the sage, using wisdom to ensnare the multitude of fools, does so because the ages have declined and the Dao is insufficient—is this not also a matter of necessity?\n\nMaster Jishengzi raised fighting cocks for King Xuan of Zhou. After ten days, the king asked: “Are the cocks ready to fight?” He replied: “Not yet. They are still vain and arrogant, relying on their qi.” After another ten days, the king asked again. He replied: “Not yet. They still respond to shadows.” After another ten days, the king asked again. He replied: “Not yet. They still glare fiercely and bristle with qi.” After another ten days, the king asked again. He said: “Almost. Though other cocks may crow, this one shows no change. From a distance, it resembles a wooden cock. Its virtue is complete. No other cock dares respond—it simply turns and flees.”\n\nA commentary states: The cock is a creature of wood. When wood rubs against wood, it ignites, hence the cock is a creature fond of fighting. Vanity and arrogance give it a haughty demeanor; reliance on qi gives it a domineering will. Though it has never seen another cock, it seeks opponents relentlessly. In such a state, it may be fearless, but can it be certain of victory? Thus, when asked if it was ready to fight, he said: “Not yet. It still responds to shadows.” It no longer relies on its qi but merely reacts to the direction of shadows. “It still glares fiercely and bristles with qi.” It no longer chases the delusion of shadows but merely responds to their direction. When an opponent arrives, it marshals its courage and waits. Yet its fierce glare unsettles its spirit, and its bristling qi disturbs its heart. Though it does not fight, its heart stirs within, and its spirit falters without—it merely endures without acting. Thus, he said: “Not yet.” Only when it was nearly ready...\n\nWhen the cock crows thereafter without alteration, gazing upon it, it resembles a wooden kite—its virtue is complete. Within, it forgets its qi; without, it forgets its form. Though other cocks stand tall and crow, it no longer hears their voices—how does it differ from withered wood? Thus, the virtue of non-contention reaches its zenith, and so it is called complete. No cock under heaven can rival it; they but turn and flee in admiration.\n\nLike the Supreme One’s pacification of the Hu barbarians, or Confucius’ mastery over his disciples.\n\nThe heart is the Crimson Palace, among birds, the Vermilion Bird. The sage nurtures it within, ensuring sufficiency without greed, satiety without contention—thus none under heaven can contend with him. The common folk merely cultivate externally, leaving the Vermilion Bird ever hungry, soaring across the eight wilds, seeking only profit. Without greed, it cannot fill its heart; without contention, it cannot satisfy its desires—only in death does it cease. How lamentable!\n\nHui Ang appeared before King Kang of Song.\n\nKing Kang stamped his feet and coughed sharply, speaking rapidly: \"What pleases me are the brave and the strong—I take no delight in those who preach benevolence and righteousness. What instruction do you have for me?\"\n\nHui Ang replied: \"I possess a Way that renders men, though brave, unable to pierce with their blades, and though strong, unable to strike true. Does Your Majesty not wish to hear of it?\"\n\nThe King of Song said: \"Excellent! This is precisely what I long to hear.\"\n\nHui Ang continued: \"Yet if blades fail to pierce and strikes miss their mark, this is still a form of humiliation. I possess another Way that makes men, though brave, dare not strike, and though strong, dare not attack. This ‘daring not’ does not mean they lack the will. I possess yet another Way that eradicates their will entirely. Without will, there can be no thought of love or profit. And I possess a Way that makes every man and woman under heaven joyfully desire to love and benefit one another. This surpasses mere bravery and strength—it stands above all four burdens. Does Your Majesty not wish to hear of it?\"\n\nThe King of Song said: \"This is what I truly desire to attain.\"\n\nHui Ang replied: \"Such was the way of Confucius and Mozi. Though Confucius and Mo Di held no land as lords nor offices as ministers, every man and woman under heaven craned their necks and stood on tiptoe, yearning for their peace and benefit. Now, Your Majesty rules a realm of ten thousand chariots. If you truly embrace this will, all within your four borders will reap its benefits—your virtue will far surpass that of Confucius and Mozi.\"\n\nThe King of Song had no reply. Hui Ang bowed and withdrew.\n\nThe King then said to his attendants: \"How persuasive the guest was in convincing me!\"\n\n**Exegesis:**\nKing Kang of Song delighted in valor and strength. When Hui Ang first appeared, the king stamped his feet, coughed sharply, and spoke harshly, resenting the imposition of benevolence and righteousness. His demeanor suggested resistance. Yet Hui Ang, seizing upon the king’s fondness for strength, tailored his words to that preference, gradually advancing his argument until he arrived at the teachings of Confucius and Mozi. Had the king accepted his words, he would have contradicted his own inclinations; had he rejected them, he would have found no fault in their reasoning. Thus, after Hui Ang’s departure, the king merely remarked to his attendants on the guest’s eloquence.\n\nLet us consider this: within the realm of persuasive speech, there is no fixed right or wrong. Success makes one the head; failure, the tail. Take the likes of Zhang Yi and Su Qin, who mastered the art of vertical and horizontal alliances and roamed the Warring States. Though the lords of the six states recognized their eloquence, none could refute their arguments, trust their offices, or employ their strategies—yet they brought peace to the Central States for over a decade. What, then, is the true measure of such persuasion’s right or wrong? Even the *Liezi* is not free from rhetorical flourish; this passage merely reflects one facet of its author’s intent.\n\n**The Yellow Emperor’s Exegesis**\nZhuangzi regarded the achievements of emperors and kings as mere byproducts of the sage’s work. To call them \"byproducts\" is not to dismiss their worth but to acknowledge that the sage’s Way is vast and profound, while the deeds of emperors and kings are but chaff and dregs. For the sage is a sage precisely because of such achievements, and the world looks up to the sage because of such governance. Thus, Zhuangzi also said: \"Nothing is more divine than Heaven, nothing richer than Earth, nothing greater than emperors and kings.\" Heaven’s divinity and Earth’s abundance manifest in auspicious omens and transformations. How, then, can the sage’s stillness, which moves and penetrates the world’s affairs to respond as an emperor or king, ever be set aside? This is why the *Yellow Emperor* chapter was written.\n\nAfter the decline of the Divine Farmer, the Yellow Emperor, Yao, and Shun arose. The Dao emerged as virtue, and the august descended as emperors. The Yellow Emperor, the first of the emperors, though burdened with worldly affairs, did not yet match Yao’s magnanimity; though possessed of salvific virtue, he did not yet equal Shun’s luminous power. Yet having grasped the world’s patterns, he began to contemplate their origins—and thus arose the changes of fortune and misfortune.\n\nAt first, he rejoiced in the world’s devotion, but later grew anxious over its disorder. The five emotions roiled within, his complexion and flesh withered without. Had he not purified his mind and embodied the Dao, how could he have withstood the world’s ultimate changes, faced its greatest difficulties, and avoided the realm of misfortune, regret, and shame? Only the Yellow Emperor, by aligning his heart and form with the supreme Way, remained untouched by disgrace and harm, even as he traversed the paths of glory and peril. His governance nearly rivaled the land of Huaxu. The deeds of the divine beings of Mount Gushe mirrored the Yellow Emperor’s achievements; Liezi’s riding the wind embodied his supreme Way.\n\nThe perfected preserve pure qi; the sage conceals himself in Heaven. Shang Qiu Kai’s harmony with all things, Liang Yang’s indifference to favor or disfavor—all stem from the root of their power to inspire the myriad beings. The ferryman’s mastery of the oar, the swimmer’s dance in the rushing waters, the hunchback’s capture of cicadas, the Zhao man’s handling of stone and fire—all exemplify their resonance with the world. Through such resonance, what in the world could burden them? Through such inspiration, what among the myriad beings could disturb them? Such was the Yellow Emperor’s Way as an emperor.\n\nThus, in his discourse on the Dao, Liezi frequently cited the *Book of the Yellow Emperor* as its foundation. The chapter concluding with \"Responding to Emperors and Kings\" carries the same intent. Yet though Liezi composed the *Yellow Emperor* chapter, when he later praised the words of Yang Zhu, he claimed that the deeds of the Five Emperors were as indistinct as dreams, merging the worthy and the foolish in oblivion.\n\nOf its remarks on Yao and Shun, it likewise declares them to have rotted alongside Jie and Robber Zhi. For when viewed through the Dao, even the Yellow Emperor’s governance did not depart from the Way; yet when observed through the achievements of emperors and kings, the true form of the Great Dao had already receded. How fleeting were their traces of merit and fame! Why should they not move with the times and perish together? In praising the words of Yang Zhu, did he not mean to discard the Yellow Emperor’s fame and merit while preserving the Great Dao?\n\n*Explication of the Perfect Dao and Virtue, Scroll Four Concluded*\n*Explication of the Perfect Dao and Virtue, Scroll Five*\n*Presented by Your Subject Jiang Yue, Inner Student of the Hangzhou Prefectural School of the Song Dynasty*\n\n**King Mu**\n\nIn the time of King Mu of Zhou, a *huaren* arrived from the westernmost land. He entered water and fire unscathed, pierced metal and stone; he reversed mountains and rivers, shifted cities and towns. Riding the void, he did not fall; touching the solid, he met no obstacle. His transformations were boundless, inexhaustible. Having altered the forms of things, he also changed the thoughts of men. King Mu revered him as a spirit, served him as a lord, prepared an open-air lodge for his dwelling, offered the three sacrificial beasts, and selected singing girls to entertain him. The *huaren* deemed the king’s palace crude and unfit to inhabit, his kitchen fare rank and inedible, his consorts foul and unlovely.\n\nKing Mu then rebuilt for him, sparing no craft in earth and timber, adorning the structure with ochre and whitewash. The five treasuries were emptied before the terrace was completed. Towering a thousand *ren*, it overlooked the summit of Zhongnan, and was named the Terrace of Central Heaven. He selected the most graceful maidens from Zheng and Wei—lithe and supple—anointed them with fragrant oils, painted their brows, adorned them with hairpins and earrings, dressed them in fine silk, trailing skirts of white linen, powdered and rouged, girdled with jade and rings. He filled the terrace with their fragrance and played the melodies *Steaming Clouds*, *Six Radiance*, *Nine Shao*, and *Morning Dew* to delight him. Month after month, jade robes were presented; day after day, jade viands were offered. Yet the *huaren* remained unmoved. Reluctantly, he descended to receive them.\n\nBefore long, he invited the king to journey with him. The king grasped the *huaren*’s sleeve, and together they soared upward until they reached the midpoint of Central Heaven, then arrived at the *huaren*’s palace. Its halls were wrought of gold and silver, strung with pearls and jade. It rose above the clouds and rain, its foundations unseen, appearing like a mass of clouds suspended in the azure. All that the eyes beheld, the ears heard, the nose inhaled, the mouth tasted—none of it belonged to the human realm. The king truly believed it to be the Purple Tenuity of the Clear Capital, the Celestial Vault of Broad Music, the abode of the Emperor on High.\n\nWhen the king looked down, the palaces below seemed but heaps of earth and piles of brushwood. He had lived there for decades without a thought for his kingdom.\n\n**Explication:**\nThe distance between what lies beyond the world and what lies within it is vast indeed. King Mu dwelt within the world; the *huaren* came from beyond it. The West governs metal, and metal is malleable—thus the *huaren* necessarily arrived from the westernmost land. Things fundamentally have no fixed form; the *huaren*, as master of creation, originates from the Great Void. Neither the six directions nor the five phases could restrain him. Thus he could gather heaven and earth within a millet grain or compress an eon into a single moment, with boundless room to spare. Entering water and fire, piercing metal and stone, reversing mountains and rivers, shifting cities and towns, altering the forms of things, changing the thoughts of men—these were but trivial matters to him.\n\nKing Mu, in his dotage, saw all things as sentient. His mind was not empty, so he was astonished by wonders and revered the *huaren* as a spirit, serving him as a lord. He exposed his bedding to the open air, offered the three sacrificial beasts, and selected singing girls, hoping to please him—yet he did not understand that what the *huaren* delighted in was true joy, which is joy without joy. Instead, he deemed the king’s offerings crude and foul, bowing his head in disdain without a glance.\n\nThe king then built the Terrace of Central Heaven atop Zhongnan, a thousand *ren* high, and filled it with maidens from Zheng and Wei. He played *Steaming Clouds*, *Six Radiance*, *Nine Shao*, and *Morning Dew* to entertain him, presented jade robes, and offered jade viands—yet he did not grasp that the *huaren* dwelt in no dwelling, savored no flavors, perceived no colors, heard no sounds. How could he take pleasure in what pleased men?\n\nSeeing the king’s earnest and reverent heart, the *huaren* deemed him teachable, though not yet ready to ascend to the highest Dao. He tested him by gradually guiding him into the lesser vehicle, taking his sleeve to journey together. They ascended halfway to Central Heaven, arriving at the *huaren*’s palace, wrought of gold and silver, strung with pearls and jade. It floated beyond the clouds, with nothing above to grasp or below to support it, like a mass of clouds suspended in the azure, never falling.\n\nAll that the eyes beheld, the ears heard, the nose inhaled, the mouth tasted—none of it existed in the mortal world. The king believed it to be the Purple Tenuity of the Clear Capital, the Celestial Vault of Broad Music, the palace of the Emperor on High. Yet when he looked down from above, he saw that his former palaces were but heaps of earth and piles of brushwood—no different from the nests of bees or ants. Thus he abandoned the base and foul, seeking the lofty and pure, unwilling to return to his former capital. He lingered there for decades.\n\nAlas! King Mu was once a companion of the Cinnabar Terrace, exiled to the mortal realm. The dust of the world had not yet deeply stained him, so he could dwell in the sacred realm. Even this lesser abode—could those born of flesh ever reach it? Even if they could, their souls would tremble and their spirits scatter, and they would seek to return.\n\nThe *huaren* again invited the king to journey with him. Wherever they went, he could neither see the sun and moon above nor the rivers and seas below. The play of light dazzled his eyes, and he could not see; the sounds assailed his ears, and he could not hear. His limbs and organs quaked, his mind wandered, his essence fled. He begged the *huaren* to let him return.\n\nThe *huaren* transported him, and the king fell as though into the void.\n\nWhen he awoke, he was still seated where he had been before, and his attendants remained as they were. Before him, the wine had not yet cleared, nor had the dishes spoiled. The king asked where he had come from, and his attendants replied, \"Your Majesty merely entered stillness.\"\n\nFrom this, King Mu remained disoriented for three months before recovering. He questioned the *huaren* again, who said, \"I journeyed with Your Majesty in spirit—how could your form have moved? Moreover, where we dwelled before—was it not your palace? Where we wandered—was it not your garden? What you deemed extraordinary was but a fleeting lapse in your usual state. At the extremes of transformation, in the space between swift and slow, can all be grasped?\"\n\nThe king was overjoyed. He neglected state affairs, took no pleasure in his ministers or concubines, and indulged in distant travels. He commanded his chariot drawn by the Eight Steeds: on the right rein, *Lai* and *Liu*, and on the left, *Lü’er*; on the right trace, *Chiji*, and on the left, *Baiyi*. The charioteer was Zaofu, with *Yi* as his right-hand guard. The second chariot bore on its right rein *Quhuang* and on its left *Yulun*, with *Daoli* on the left trace and *Shanzi* on the right. The charioteer was Boyao, with Sanbai driving and Benrong as his guard.\n\nThey galloped a thousand *li* to the land of the Giant Sou clan. The Giant Sou presented the king with white crane’s blood to drink and offered the milk of cows and horses to wash his feet, as well as those of his two charioteers. After drinking, they departed and lodged at the slopes of Kunlun, on the sunny side of the Red Water. The next day, they ascended Kunlun’s peak to behold the palace of the Yellow Emperor and sealed it to bequeath to later generations. Then they were received as guests by the Queen Mother of the West, who feasted with the king upon the Jasper Pool. The Queen Mother sang for the king, and he harmonized with her—her song was mournful.\n\nThere, he beheld the place where the sun sets. In a single day, they traveled ten thousand *li*, and the king sighed, saying, \"Alas! I, alone, am not replete in virtue yet am content in pleasure. Will later generations recount my faults?\" King Mu was nearly a divine being—able to exhaust the joys of his lifetime, as though he had ascended in a hundred years.\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe Way of the *huaren* is endlessly transformative, yet it does not depart from the One. Only those who attain this ultimate Oneness can truly realize the Way, leaping in an instant into the realm of nothingness. For gradual learners, their capacity is not yet ready to be instructed in the supreme Way of the sages. Thus, the *huaren* provisionally displayed the transformations of the middle heavens, allowing the king to witness the insubstantiality of the human world, to recognize the weariness of worldly burdens, and to forget his kingdom—only then did he reveal the true realm of the supreme Way.\n\nWhere he looked up and saw no sun or moon, height was insufficient to describe it; where he looked down and saw no rivers or seas, depth was insufficient to name it. The radiance that dazzled his eyes—his vision was confounded and could not see—yet the light of heaven arises within, to be perceived by spirit, not by the eyes. The sounds that assailed his ears—his hearing was overwhelmed and could not listen—yet the music of heaven resounds of itself, to be heard by *qi*, not by the ears. Thus, beholding the *huaren*’s palace was like gazing upon one’s own kingdom from the middle heavens.\n\nKing Mu was not yet ready to advance further, so his heart was unmoored, his spirit scattered, his mind bewildered, his essence lost—he begged the *huaren* to let him return. When the *huaren* again invited the king to journey with him, the places they reached were no different from the middle heavens, yet his perceptions were so altered. For the wondrous Way abides not apart from the present place, leaping beyond all existence. It was not merely unlike the *huaren*’s palace—where he dwelled, where he wandered, was no different from the king’s own palace or garden.\n\nFrom this, we know that the distinction between the mad and the sage lies in name alone, not in reality; people are deluded, but the Way is not. It is like journeying in spirit while the form remains unmoved. When the *huaren* came from the western extremity, did he seek to display marvels and astonish the vulgar? No—his aim was to guide all people toward the wondrous Way. Had King Mu first awakened to the Way, the governance of the Yellow Emperor and the land of Huaxu might have been within reach—how could it have been merely his own amusement?\n\nWhen King Mu emptied his five organs to serve the *huaren*, the *huaren* still did not rejoice. Did the *huaren* truly delight in the pleasures of sound, form, scent, or taste? No—he wished the king to awaken through these to the joylessness of worldly pleasures. Failing that, the *huaren* journeyed with him in spirit, displaying illusions to reveal the spontaneous arising and vanishing of transformations, that he might awaken to the natural principle of the spirit. Yet the king mistook these provisional displays for the Purple Tenuity of the Clear Capital and the grand music of the Highest Heaven, taking them as true delights—this was even further from the mark.\n\nWhen the *huaren* again invited the king to journey with him, he revealed the true realm of the Way. Yet King Mu could not advance further; he begged the *huaren* to let him return. Why? The practice of the wondrous Way transcends form and body—how could one who has not attained the Way or realized its principle dwell in its domain? The *huaren* knew he would never awaken, so when the king sought to return, he did not stop him.\n\nNevertheless, when the *huaren* transported him, the king fell as though into the void—this too was a means to awaken him. Yet King Mu ultimately did not awaken. Thus, upon waking, he remained disoriented for three months. However, from this he recovered, questioned the *huaren* again, and was told of the principle of spiritual wandering. Only then did he begin to grasp the principle of transformation and rejoice.\n\nThereafter, he neglected state affairs and abandoned worldly concerns, took no pleasure in his ministers or concubines and distanced himself from others, indulged his desires without restraint, and wandered far without limit. Commanding his chariot drawn by the Eight Steeds, he galloped without bound. Charioteers like Zaofu, unparalleled in their generation, and the Eight Steeds, not of ordinary stock—traveling ten thousand *li* in a single day—how could the flight of wind and clouds compare to their swiftness?\n\nGalloping a thousand *li*, he arrived at the land of Minister Sou. *Sou* means \"to select,\" for he was still galloping and choosing his direction. The white crane is a creature of purity, soaring high; oxen and horses are beasts that bear heavy burdens and travel far. Offering the blood of a white crane for the king to drink was meant to alter his thoughts and urge him toward loftiness. Preparing the fresh milk of oxen and horses to wash the king’s feet was to cleanse his form and enable him to journey afar.\n\nKunlun is the mountain of the westernmost reaches. To call it Kunlun is to liken it to the Dao’s soaring brilliance and primordial vastness. North of the Red Water—*yang* containing *yin*—is the image of the mysterious and wondrous. At first, he reached the land of the Great Sou, but passed through without lingering. Lodging at the foothills of Kunlun and north of the Red Water, he merely sojourned briefly without staying long. On another day, he ascended Kunlun’s peak—this was progress in the Dao.\n\n*Zhuangzi* speaks of Zhili Shu observing the hills of Mingbo, where the ruins of Kunlun served as the Yellow Emperor’s resting place. It tells how the Yellow Emperor, gazing south from Kunlun’s peak, returned only to lose his dark pearl—thus the symbolic significance of Kunlun as the Dao is clear. If King Mu could ascend Kunlun’s peak, then his unrestrained wanderings indeed reached far. Yet his travels could not dispense with chariots and horses, unlike the spirit-wandering of the *huaren*. Thus, though he traveled ten thousand *li* in a day, his journey remained measurable in time. Though he entered the westernmost reaches, he never surpassed Kunlun. He did not roam the Great Void and could not reach the land from which the *huaren* came.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor was a sage of the highest order, yet even when he sealed himself in his palace, none could see him. The Queen Mother of the West, a lineage of immortals and sages, though not bound by worldly rule, received him as a guest. They raised cups to each other at Yaochi, and she sang to him—surely he could have become intoxicated with the Dao and attained its joy. Yet King Mu’s harmonizing song was mournful, for he could only exhaust the pleasures of his own lifetime and did not attain the celestial joy.\n\nObserving where the sun sets—the sun being a metaphor for the Dao—*Zhuangzi* describes the ten suns rising together, illuminating all things, as the flourishing of virtue. Thus, the sun’s setting in the westernmost reaches may symbolize the sage gathering the Dao and returning to the great origin and primordial source. Yet merely observing where the sun sets is only observation, not the attainment of the Dao. Thus, in the end, he sighed that his virtue was not full and his joy not complete.\n\n*The Book of Zhou* records that he lived to a hundred, senile and dissolute—this is how later generations tallied his faults. Yet he exhausted the joys of his own lifetime and attained the great fast of longevity, which is what the world calls \"ascending to the Dao through refinement.\" Thus, when later scholars examined the bamboo slips gnawed by bookworms, searched the stone chambers, and consulted *The Golden Cord*, *The Classic of Mountains*, *The Approaching Elegance*, and *The Great Commentary*, all recorded his tale.\n\nI have said that the Yellow Emperor’s dream was a spirit-journey, and King Mu’s transformation was also a spirit-wandering—they were equal in their dreamlike nature. Yet their effects on governance differed: the Yellow Emperor’s dream arose from fasting the mind and disciplining the form, while King Mu’s transformation was merely a change wrought by the *huaren*. Moreover, the Yellow Emperor awoke naturally, whereas King Mu, unable to do so, had to ask the *huaren* to return. This is why the Yellow Emperor, upon waking, was content and at ease, achieving the governance of Huaxu, while King Mu, upon waking, remained disoriented for three months and could only exhaust the pleasures of his own lifetime.\n\nLao Chengzi studied illusion under Master Yin Wen for three years, yet was not taught anything. Lao Chengzi asked to be told his faults and sought to leave. Master Yin Wen bowed and led him into a chamber, dismissed his attendants, and spoke to him, explaining: \"To desire to study illusion is to wish to use illusion to return and learn from illusion. After three years, could the extremes of transformation and illusion be fully imitated? Not teaching you the art for three years was itself the teaching.\"\n\nLao Chengzi could not fathom the principle of unspoken delight and instead asked to be told his faults and leave. Thus, Master Yin Wen had no choice but to speak to him, bowing and leading him into the chamber. The Dao is profound, so he dismissed his attendants to speak privately—those not meant to know were kept from seeing or hearing. Lao Chengzi was one who heard the great Dao late in life yet achieved mastery, so though he initially asked to be told his faults and leave, he ultimately transmitted the art. Master Yin Wen had inwardly attained the Dao and displayed this refinement to guide the masses, which is why Lao Chengzi studied under him.\n\nHe said: \"When Lao Dan departed for the west, he turned to me and said: 'The *qi* of living beings, the forms of material things—all are illusion. What the Creator begins, what *yin* and *yang* transform, is called life and death. Exhausting the numbers and grasping change, following form to shift—this is called transformation, called illusion. The Creator’s skill is subtle, its work profound, inherently difficult to exhaust or complete. Following form, its skill is manifest, its work shallow, thus it arises and vanishes in an instant. Only when you understand that illusion and transformation are no different from life and death can you begin to study illusion. You and I are also illusion—what need is there to study?'\"\n\nThe explanation: Life, death, transformation, and illusion—when discussed in general terms—are like a body’s shadow, like bubbles on water, like dew on garlic chives, like lightning’s flash: all are illusion. The subtle and profound, difficult to exhaust or complete, are called life and death. The manifest and shallow, arising and vanishing in an instant, are called transformation and illusion. To call them so is to name them based on their function. Thus, though their subtlety differs, their skill is the same; though their depth varies, their work is equal.\"\n\nThen how do transformation and illusion differ from life and death? Only when you know that transformation and illusion are no different from life and death can life and death no longer be considered great. Transformation and illusion cannot be called shallow, nor can life and death alter transformation—transformation arises from the self. Thus, those who study illusion must base themselves on knowing illusion.\n\nYet knowing does not depart from awareness. To speak of the aware is not to depart from the realm of illusion, and even the unaware do not depart from illusion. Therefore, to study illusion through knowing is to use illusion to transform illusion. Though things may transform, both things and self remain within illusion. Once one possesses the knowledge of studying illusion, one already falls into the realm of illusion.\n\nOnly those who truly awaken through their inherent nature can extinguish all illusions. Without any deliberate intent, what need is there to study?\n\nThus, Master Yinwen’s refusal to instruct Laochengzi was the act of one who truly understood illusion. Laochengzi returned and, applying Master Yinwen’s words, pondered deeply for three months. Thereupon, he gained mastery over existence and nonexistence, commanding the seasons to shift at will. In winter, he summoned thunder; in summer, he conjured ice. What flew he made walk, and what walked he made fly.\n\nThroughout his life, he never clung to his arts, and thus the world never transmitted them.\n\n**Explanation:** That which adheres to form is never free from illusion. Though the workings of creation are wondrous, they do not depart from illusion. The illusions of creation arise constantly through human agency; the illusions of human agency, in turn, depend on heavenly principle. The illusions of creation do not depart from yin and yang; the transformations of humans do not depart from numerical change. Governed by yin and yang, even the real becomes illusion; exhausting numerical change, even illusion awakens. Awakening lies within the self—how could illusion belong to another? Once one attains this Dao, one not only illudes things without being illuded by them, but can also command the seasons to shift, conjure thunder in winter and ice in summer, reverse the flight of birds and the gait of beasts, and seize the illusions of creation itself.\n\nYet what, after all, gives rise to illusion? Fundamentally, it arises from the wondrous mind, which generates its substance—just as flowers in the sky emerge from emptiness. Though the substance of illusion appears, its principle remains wondrous. Appearance gives rise to illusion; wonder enables it. Only through appearance can it be spoken of; only through wonder must one ponder deeply for three months before attaining the Dao.\n\nMoreover, those of old who studied illusion did not do so to astonish the vulgar. Their study aimed to awaken to the Dao through illusion. Thus, when speaking of their ability to illude, flight and gait could be reversed, thunder and ice could be summoned. Yet once they attained the Dao, they never clung to their arts throughout their lives, and so the world never transmitted them.\n\nAlas! The wonder of transformation is such that even Master Yinwen did not presume to claim the Dao as his own, merely citing the words of the Old Master as he departed westward.\n\nMaster Liezi said: *\"Those skilled in transformation keep their Dao hidden and ordinary, their achievements indistinguishable from others. The virtue of the Five Emperors and the accomplishments of the Three Kings were not necessarily the result of wisdom or courage alone—some arose through transformation. Who can fathom this?\"*\n\n**Explanation:** What makes heaven and earth heaven and earth is their transformation of the myriad things. What makes the sage a sage is their awakening to the Dao of transformation. The illusions of heaven and earth—yin and yang alternating, cold and heat measured—cause the myriad things to follow their Dao and attain their proper place, without boasting of commanding the seasons as an achievement. If heaven and earth were to illude by summoning thunder in winter and ice in summer, no living thing would survive. Thus, those skilled in transformation—why would they display marvels or strive to astonish the senses? Therefore, the sage’s transformations, though hidden and ordinary, cannot be swiftly discerned in their effects, yet they remain no different from others. This is why Master Laochengzi, though capable of illusion, never clung to his arts throughout his life. Confucius could have done the same but chose not to—this is the same Dao. The Five Emperors and Three Kings were all sages of old; whether yielding or contending, they adapted to their times. Though they displayed wisdom and courage, their silent, wordless wonder worked unseen. People could witness their achievements but could not fathom how they transformed—this is beyond the governance of emperors and kings.\n\n**Awakening has eight signs; dreams have six conditions.**\n\nWhat are the eight signs?\n1. The familiar,\n2. The intentional,\n3. The attained,\n4. The lost,\n5. Sorrow,\n6. Joy,\n7. Life,\n8. Death.\nThese eight signs are what form encounters.\n\nWhat are the six conditions?\n1. Ordinary dreams,\n2. Troubled dreams,\n3. Thoughtful dreams,\n4. Waking dreams,\n5. Joyful dreams,\n6. Fearful dreams.\nThese six arise from the interplay of spirit.\n\n**Explanation:** The signs of awakening and the conditions of dreams, though encountered by spirit and form, do not share a single principle. Fundamentally, they arise from the mind’s own creation. Those who do not recognize the origin of sensory change are perplexed when events arise; those who recognize it understand their cause. Understanding their cause, they are free from distress.\n\n**Explanation:** The origin of sensory change does not exceed the signs of awakening and the conditions of dreams—this is the constant principle. Recognizing their cause and remaining free from distress, how much more so for those who know the Dao? Those who know the Dao see life and death as no different from themselves; their view of dreams and awakening is but a trifle.\n\nThe waxing and waning, ebb and flow of this single body all correspond to heaven and earth and respond to the kinds of things. Thus, when yin qi is strong, one dreams of wading through great waters in terror; when yang qi is strong, one dreams of traversing great fires and burning. When both yin and yang are strong, one dreams of life and death. When overly sated, one dreams of giving; when overly hungry, one dreams of taking. Those afflicted by floating emptiness dream of soaring; those afflicted by sinking solidity dream of drowning. Sleeping with a belt beneath one dreams of snakes; birds perching on one’s hair cause one to dream of flying. When yin prevails, one dreams of fire; when illness approaches, one dreams of eating. Those who drink wine dream of sorrow; those who sing and dance dream of weeping.\n\n**Explanation:** Dreams are encounters of the spirit. The Dao of the supreme spirit is unfathomable by yin and yang, and since none can fathom it, none can control it. The human spirit gathers through essence, dwelling within the body, dependent on yin and yang. Bound to them, it is inevitably enslaved by them. Thus, the waxing and waning, ebb and flow of this single body—its spirit’s encounters become dreams, corresponding to heaven and earth, responding to the kinds of things, with no escape. Therefore, dreaming of wading through great waters or traversing great fires is governed by the strength of qi. Dreaming of giving when sated or taking when hungry is driven by desire. Dreaming of soaring or drowning is the spirit being gnawed by illness. Dreaming of snakes or flying is the spirit being stirred by the kinds of things. Dreaming of fire when yin prevails or of eating when illness approaches—such are the inversions of dream-thought. Dreaming of sorrow after drinking or weeping after singing and dancing—such are the alternations of sorrow and joy.\n\nThe body, though small, endures a hundred years of life, yet day and night divide its span. If even for a moment it fails to preserve its pure qi, then with the waxing and waning of time, the interplay of yin and yang, and the myriad things of day and night, it becomes besieged. The form toils without rest, the spirit dissipates without cease, and one spends a lifetime in ceaseless labor, transforming alongside the things of the world—how can one fail to awaken?\n\nI have examined the principles of dreaming and waking, the constancy of night and day. What appears in dreams, though called an encounter of the spirit, is in truth the servitude of the form. If the form enslaves me, it is not that the form has the power to enslave, but that I enslave myself. By my own enslavement to the form, the form in turn enslaves me, and I, subjected to its servitude, cannot master it.\n\nWhen dreaming, one does not know it is a dream; upon waking, one recognizes the dream, yet soon dreams again, still believing it to be waking. Night and day flow ceaselessly, and throughout life, one alternates between waking and dreaming without realization. Though the visions of water and fire, giving and taking, are initially without substance, the states of sorrow, fear, joy, and delight arise truly in the heart.\n\nYet waking knows the dream, while the dream knows not waking—thus waking is surely more real than dreaming. What waking does remains confined to thought and deliberation; what dreaming foreknows appears beyond thought and deliberation—thus dreaming is indeed more numinous than waking.\n\nThe waking of each day follows a familiar order in its deeds, while the dreams of each night present sights and sounds that rarely persist. Such is the fleeting distinction between dreaming and waking, yet their divergence extends to this degree. How much greater, then, is the transformation of life and death, the vast transition of departure and return? Without the proper person, can one hope to avoid being swept away in the currents of creation?\n\nNevertheless, if one awakens early to the distinction between dreaming and waking, then the comings and goings of life and death are no longer worth mentioning.\n\n*Explication of the* Chongxu Zhide Zhenjing *(The Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue in the Most High and Pristine), Scroll Five, concludes.*\n*Explication of the* Chongxu Zhide Zhenjing *(The Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue in the Most High and Pristine), Scroll Six.*\n\nMinister Jiang Yu, an Inner Student of the Hangzhou Prefecture Academy of the Song Dynasty, respectfully presents:\n\n**Under King Mu**\n\nMaster Liezi said: \"When the spirit encounters, it becomes a dream; when form engages, it becomes an affair. Thus, daytime thoughts give rise to nighttime dreams—these are encounters of spirit and form. Therefore, when the spirit is concentrated, thoughts and dreams naturally dissipate. One who trusts waking cannot speak of the Dao; one who trusts dreams cannot be called enlightened—these are but the comings and goings of the transformations of things.\"\n\nThe men of old who were true persons forgot themselves in waking and slept without dreaming—how could this be mere empty words?\n\n**Explication:**\nDaytime thoughts and nighttime dreams—dreams arise from the mingling of the hun-souls, while waking is the unfolding of form. Day and night alternate in their course, the transformations of things coming and going like flowers in empty space, arising and vanishing in an instant. Thus, one who trusts waking cannot speak of the Dao, and one who trusts dreams cannot be called enlightened.\n\nYet though spirit and form encounter things, when one examines their origin, all is self-created. The inversions of thoughts and dreams, and the self-generated nature of thoughts and dreams—there is no other cause; it lies solely in whether the celestial spirit is concentrated or not.\n\nThe so-called true person does not depart from essence, for their spirit is concentrated. They do not delight in life nor detest death; their going forth brings no joy, their return no resistance. They do not discard the Dao with the heart, nor do they aid Heaven with human effort. They come and go with ease, unshaken by the transformations of things, and hold no trust in either dreams or waking. Thus, they forget themselves in waking and sleep without dreaming.\n\nAt the southwestern corner of the Western Limits lies a country whose borders are unknown, called the Land of Ancient Wilderness. The qi of yin and yang do not intersect there, so cold and heat are indistinguishable; the light of sun and moon does not reach it, so day and night are undifferentiated. Its people neither eat nor wear clothing but sleep often, waking once every fifty days. To them, what they do in dreams is real, while what they see in waking is illusory.\n\nThe Central Kingdom, equidistant from the four seas, spans north and south of the Yellow River and east and west of Mount Tai, extending over ten thousand li. Its yin and yang are measured precisely, so there is one cold and one heat; its divisions of dusk and dawn are clear, so there is one day and one night. Its people range from wise to foolish, its myriad things flourish, and its skills and arts are manifold. There are rulers and subjects, rites and laws. Their deeds are beyond counting. They regard what they do in waking as real and what they see in dreams as illusory.\n\nAt the northeastern corner of the Eastern Limits lies a country called the Land of Flourishing Settlements. Its earth is perpetually warm, and though the lingering light of sun and moon shines upon it, no fine crops grow there. Its people eat grass roots and tree fruits, knowing nothing of cooked food. Their natures are fierce and unyielding; the strong oppress the weak, valuing victory over righteousness. They run swiftly and rest little, remaining awake without sleep.\n\n**Explication:**\nThe southwestern corner of the Western Limits is the direction of Kun and Dui. All things follow Kun’s labor and tend toward Dui’s joy and rest, so in that land, what is done in dreams is considered real. It is called the Land of Ancient Wilderness, for its Dao is vast and boundless, existing since antiquity—this is the nature of the southwest.\n\nThe northeastern corner of the Eastern Limits is the direction of Gen and Zhen. All things follow Gen’s paths to reach Zhen’s great thoroughfares, soon to advance toward Li’s mutual manifestation. Thus, its customs favor waking and eschew sleep. It is called the Land of Flourishing Settlements because things there grow abundantly and gather in communities—this is the nature of the northeast.\n\nIn the Central Kingdom, yin and yang are measured precisely, so there is one day and one night, one cold and one heat. They regard waking as real and dreams as illusory, yet none can escape the changes of yin and yang.\n\nIn the time of the Zhou, the House of Yin greatly expanded its wealth. Those who served beneath them toiled from dawn to dusk without rest. There was an old laborer whose strength was exhausted, yet he was pressed to work even harder. By day, he groaned as he toiled; by night, he sank into deep sleep, his spirit scattered and lost. Every night, he dreamed he was a lord, ruling over the people, managing the affairs of the state, wandering through palaces and gardens, indulging every desire—his joy was unmatched. Upon waking, he returned to his labors.\n\nWhen others consoled him for his toil, the laborer said: \"A human life spans a hundred years, divided equally between day and night. By day, I am a servant, and though it is bitter, it is bitter indeed; by night, I am a lord, and my joy is unmatched. What cause have I for complaint?\"\n\nThe House of Yin was consumed by worldly affairs, its thoughts fixed on family wealth. Both mind and body were exhausted, and at night, it too sank into deep sleep. In dreams, it became a servant, running errands and performing every task, enduring scoldings and beatings without end. In sleep, it muttered and groaned until dawn.\n\nDistressed, the House of Yin sought counsel from a friend. The friend said: \"Your position brings honor, and your wealth is abundant—you surpass others by far. Yet to dream of being a servant is but the natural alternation of hardship and ease. How could you hope to have both waking and dreaming as you wish?\"\n\nUpon hearing this, the House of Yin eased the laborer’s workload and reduced its own burdensome thoughts. Its illness gradually abated.\n\n**Explication:**\nDay and night are divided, with form and spirit alternating in use. When the spirit labors by day, the body rests, so by night, the spirit rests while the body labors. When the body labors by day, the spirit rests, so by night, the spirit labors while the body rests. This is the Dao of yin and yang’s waxing and waning, of things reaching their extreme and then reversing.\n\nThus, the House of Yin and its servant experienced the alternation of hardship and ease, unable to have both in waking and dreaming. The ignorant, failing to understand the principle of fullness and emptiness, trust waking as real and dismiss dreams as illusory. They pursue the gains and losses of the day but pay no heed to the joys and sorrows of dreams. Little do they realize that if dreams were without awareness, it would be well, but if dreams *are* aware, then sorrow and joy, desire and aversion are no different from waking—how then can they be dismissed as illusory?\n\nThat the House of Yin recognized this as an illness and sought counsel from a friend was perhaps because the spirit had already received its warning.\n\nAs for easing the labor of one’s servants and reducing one’s own burdens of thought, if the illness finds even slight respite, then the principle may indeed be trusted. But if one truly ceases to weary the self, diminishing thoughts layer by layer, then the spirit may congeal, and dream-visions dissolve—how could this merely bring slight respite to the illness?\n\nThere was a man of Zheng who gathered firewood in the wilds when he encountered a startled deer. He chased it down and struck it dead. Fearing others would see, he hastily concealed it in a ditch, covering it with plantain leaves, overcome with joy. Soon after, he forgot where he had hidden it and took it all for a dream. As he walked along, he hummed of the affair. A passerby heard him, followed his words, and took the deer. Upon returning home, he told his wife, “A firewood-gatherer dreamed he had caught a deer but forgot where it was. Now I have it—he was truly dreaming!” His wife said, “Is it not you who dreamed of the firewood-gatherer catching the deer? Was there ever a firewood-gatherer? Now that you truly have the deer, is your dream not real?” The man replied, “I have the deer in hand—why trouble myself over whether he dreamed or I dreamed?”\n\nThe firewood-gatherer returned, vexed at losing the deer. That night, he truly dreamed of the hiding place and of the one who had taken it. At dawn, he followed his dream and found it. They took their dispute to court, where the magistrate ruled: “You first truly caught the deer but falsely called it a dream; now you truly dreamed of the deer but falsely call it real. He truly took your deer, yet you dispute it with him. Your wife claims both dreamed of the deer, so no one truly has it. Since the deer is now here, let it be divided in two.” He reported this to the lord of Zheng, who exclaimed, “Ah! Is the magistrate about to dream of dividing another’s deer?” He consulted his prime minister, who said, “Dream or not—a matter I cannot discern. To distinguish waking from dreaming, only the Yellow Emperor or Confucius could do so. Now that they are gone, who can decide? Yet perhaps the magistrate’s words may suffice.”\n\nThe explanation: It is human nature to trust waking as real, for it is what the body touches, and to dismiss dreams as illusory, for they are but the wanderings of the soul. Yet if one forgets what one does while awake, is this not akin to dreaming? And if what one encounters in dreams proves real, is this not akin to waking? For waking acts often stem from intention, so the spirit easily forgets them; but dreams may arise without intent, so the spirit remains sharp. In essence, dreaming and waking are not two different things—obscure them, and both are real; scrutinize them, and both are illusory. If one insists dreams are real, then while dreaming, why does one not know it is a dream? If one insists waking is real, then once awake, why does one still have dreams?\n\nThis man lived in the central kingdom, so he distinguished dreaming and waking thus. Had one spoken of this principle to the ancient tribes of the wilds, their judgments would surely differ. The firewood-gatherer of Zheng first took reality for a dream, then took a dream for reality. The one who took the deer followed his words and treated it as a dream, yet claimed the deer and disputed it. Dream and waking intertwined, truth and falsehood raced, right and wrong clashed—hence the lawsuit. The magistrate, who adjudicates disputes, faced a dilemma: if he sided with the taker, the deer originally belonged to the firewood-gatherer; if he sided with the gatherer, the taker had followed the dream to find it. Since it all arose from a dream, right and wrong were tangled, with no clear resolution. To divide the deer in two—how could this be a just verdict? This is why the lord of Zheng sighed and consulted his prime minister.\n\nYet the principle of waking and dreaming divides day and night equally. Trusting waking alone leaves one mute; trusting dreams alone leaves one lost. Only the Yellow Emperor and Confucius could discern the truth—without them, how could right and wrong be swiftly decided? Thus, though the magistrate’s division of the deer was a last resort, in the end, he neither trusted nor distrusted waking or dreaming—he trusted nothing, yet trusted all. Though he did not reach the point where dream-visions dissolve, he may be said to have borne the burden well. And was not the magistrate’s judgment, after all, acceptable?\n\nThe magistrate represents the law. Where there are forms and evidence, and the law must decide, right and wrong become tangled, with no clear answer. One can only act as circumstances permit—is this not acceptable when no better course exists?\n\nIn the Yang district of Song, there was a man named Hua Zi who, in middle age, suffered from forgetfulness. What he took in the morning he forgot by evening; what he received at dusk he forgot by dawn. On the road, he forgot to walk; at home, he forgot to sit. He did not recognize what came before or after. His household was distressed. They exhausted divination and sought omens, but to no avail.\n\nThey sought out shamans to pray for him, but the condition remained; they consulted physicians to treat him, but it did not cease. In Lu there was a Confucian scholar who offered his services, claiming he could cure Hua Zi. His wife and children offered half their property in exchange for the remedy. The scholar said: \"This is not a matter for divination or omens, nor for prayers or supplications, nor for medicine or stone needles. Let me attempt to transform his heart and alter his thoughts—perhaps then he may recover.\"\n\nThereupon, they exposed him to the elements so that he sought clothing; they starved him so that he sought food; they confined him in darkness so that he sought light. The scholar joyfully told Hua Zi’s son: \"The illness can be cured. However, my method is secret and not to be passed down to others. Let me send away all attendants and remain alone with him in seclusion for seven days.\" They complied. None knew what he did, yet an affliction of many years vanished in a single morning.\n\nThe explanation states: When principles are entangled with falsehood, divination may be consulted; when matters are bound to profit and harm, prayers may be offered; when illness arises from indulgence, medicine may be applied. But the malady of forgetfulness is so vast that one is unaware of the existence of heaven and earth—how could divination, prayers, or medicine cure it? Exposing him to seek clothing shows he had not forgotten cold and heat; starving him to seek food shows he had not forgotten the body; confining him in darkness to seek light shows he had not forgotten likes and dislikes. Thus, Hua Zi’s forgetfulness was merely an obstruction caused by illness, not true oblivion of worldly affairs. Therefore, the scholar rejoiced, knowing the illness could be cured. If it were true oblivion, even the workings of creation could do nothing—how could a Confucian’s shallow art suffice?\n\nConfucians, who exhume graves under the guise of poetry and ritual, are the greatest corrupters of the Dao. Their methods subtly mislead the people, making them depart from truth and embrace falsehood without awareness. Thus, the scholar insisted his method was secret and must be transmitted only in strict privacy. After seven days together, the chaos within Hua Zi perished, and his sight, hearing, eating, and breathing became like those of ordinary men. The long-standing illness vanished in a single morning.\n\nOnce Hua Zi awoke, he flew into a great rage, cast out his wife, punished his children, and brandished a halberd to drive away the scholar. The people of Song seized him and demanded an explanation. Hua Zi said: \"Before, when I was forgetful, I was vast and unaware of the existence of heaven and earth. Now, suddenly recalling the past, decades of life and death, gain and loss, sorrow and joy, likes and dislikes—all ten thousand threads surge forth. I fear that future matters of life and death, gain and loss, sorrow and joy, and likes and dislikes will disturb my heart like this. Can I ever again attain even a moment’s forgetfulness?\"\n\nZi Gong heard of this and found it strange. He reported it to Confucius, who said: \"This is not something within your grasp.\" Then he turned to Yan Hui and told him to record it.\n\nThe explanation states: The difficulty of encountering truth and the ease with which falsehood confuses people have persisted for a long time. When one’s joy lies in truth, the myriad things cannot alter one’s preferences, and even the love of wife and children may be forsaken. Nothing in the world can compare to its worth, and even the Confucian Dao is not worth adhering to. Thus, once Hua Zi awoke, he cast out his wife, punished his children, and drove away the scholar with a halberd. Knowing the joy of forgetfulness, he should have been able to forget worldly burdens without a second thought. Yet he still feared external things would disturb his heart and prevent even a moment’s forgetfulness—how much worse for those who never knew the joy of forgetfulness and daily rush toward the path of right and wrong? When Hua Zi’s family regarded his forgetfulness as a household affliction, and the scholar rejoiced at curing his illness, how utterly confused their hearts must have been!\n\nThe man called Hua Zi of Yang district in Song: \"Yang\" pertains to growth and nurturing, while \"Hua\" (flourishing) thrives under yang—both incline toward the path of turmoil. In middle age, he fell ill with forgetfulness, shedding his flourishing and returning to the root. But once awakened, he again rushed toward the path of entanglement. The reversal of the norm is the joyous sheen of *Dui*; the emergence of life is the hasty decisiveness of *Zhen*. Thus, Hua Zi flew into a great rage upon awakening.\n\nZi Gong belonged to the category of eloquence, considering himself superior to others in discernment, yet he was rebuked by Confucius. Yan Hui, however, could forget benevolence and righteousness, forget ritual and music, and repeatedly advanced until he attained \"sitting in forgetfulness.\" Therefore, Confucius turned to Yan Hui to record this.\n\nAmong the Feng clan of Qin there was a man whose son was clever in youth but developed a bewildering illness in adulthood. He heard singing and mistook it for weeping; saw white and thought it black; smelled fragrance and deemed it rotten; tasted sweetness and found it bitter; walked correctly and believed it wrong. Wherever his mind wandered—heaven and earth, the four directions, water and fire, cold and heat—nothing was not inverted.\n\nThe Yang family told his father: \"The gentlemen of Lu possess many arts and skills—perhaps they can cure him? Why not seek them out?\" His father traveled to Lu and, passing through Chen, encountered Lao Dan. He described his son’s symptoms. Lao Dan said: \"Are you any less deluded than your son? Today, the people of the world are all confused by right and wrong, blinded by profit and harm. Those with the same illness are many, yet none are awakened. Moreover, the delusion of one person is not enough to overturn a household; the delusion of a household is not enough to overturn a village; the delusion of a village is not enough to overturn a state; the delusion of a state is not enough to overturn the world. If the whole world were deluded, who would overturn it? If all the people of the world were like your son, then you would be the deluded one. Joy and sorrow, sound and color, scent and taste, right and wrong—who can correct them?\"\n\nThe explanation states: Singing and weeping, white and black, fragrance and stench, sweetness and bitterness—even heaven and earth, the four directions, water and fire, cold and heat—all these manifold names share a single wondrous root, originally without distinction. It is through deluded emotions that likes and dislikes arise, that things are distinguished, and that various false names are assigned. Seeking reality through names, clinging stubbornly without change—none are awakened.\n\n\"To examine but one aspect: to take white as white is to follow the multitude; to take white as black is to follow oneself. Following oneself invites doubt from the many; following the many brings confusion to oneself. Their words differ, mine differ—white and black bear distinct names. Though names and words diverge, the essence remains unmoved; it is only in names and words that distinctions arise. The many and the few contend, and the few cannot withstand the many. Leading delusion with delusion, all sink together and do not return—how can one hastily deem the shared affliction of the multitude as right and the solitary awakening of the one as wrong?\n\nMaster Yang believed his Dao could overturn the world, yet he still contended with the Confucians and Mohists over right and wrong, white and black. Thus, Feng was troubled by this and sent him to seek counsel from the many masters of Lu. Feng was one who met things and matched them, hence in youth he was clever, but in maturity he took delusion and confusion as his malady.\n\nMoreover, my own words here are not necessarily free from delusion—how much less can the gentlemen of Lu, those couriers of delusion, resolve the delusions of others? Better to take your provisions and return home.\n\nThe explanation states: The world originally has no fixed right; the great Dao does not enter into verbal explanations. Yet the sages, in bequeathing teachings to the world, could not avoid such discourse. They also feared that learners would take the words of the multitude as wrong and the words of the sages as right, clinging to them without release, guarding them without forgetting—as the saying goes, 'Gold, though precious, becomes a film in the eye.' Thus Laozi said: 'My own words here are not necessarily free from delusion. How much less can the gentlemen of Lu, who establish teachings of benevolence, righteousness, loyalty, and trust, and bequeath the texts of the *Odes*, *Documents*, rites, and music—the most deluded of the deluded—resolve the delusions of others?' Take your provisions and hasten home, for this is meant to turn you inward, to seek within.\n\nA man of Yan was born in Yan and raised in Chu. In old age, he returned to his homeland and passed through Jin. His traveling companions deceived him, pointing to a city and saying, 'This is the city of Yan.' The man’s expression changed sorrowfully. They pointed to a shrine and said, 'This is the village shrine of your homeland.'\"\n\nThen he sighed deeply. Pointing to a house, they said, \"This is your ancestors’ dwelling.\" He wept silently. Pointing to a mound, they said, \"This is your ancestors’ grave.\" The man could not restrain his sobs. His companions burst into laughter, saying, \"We deceived you before—this is but Jin.\" The man was overcome with shame.\n\nWhen at last he reached Yan and truly beheld the city and village shrine of his homeland, when he truly saw his ancestors’ dwelling and grave, his sorrow had already grown faint. The explanation follows: Those who transmit teachings may be true or false; those who receive the Dao may do so early or late. What enters first becomes the master; what enters later becomes the guest. Today’s scholars, having first encountered a teacher who transmits false methods, cling to them and guard them, believing nothing could surpass them. Years later, should they suddenly meet a true teacher who imparts the true principle, they cling to disbelief instead, and to the end of their days remain unenlightened—how lamentable!\n\nThus Liezi set forth this parable of the Yan man passing through Jin. This man, born in Yan and raised in Chu, returned in old age. Passing through Jin, his companions deceived him, saying, \"This is the city of Yan.\" His expression changed sorrowfully. Pointing to a shrine, they said, \"This is the village shrine of your homeland.\" He sighed deeply. Pointing to a house, they said, \"This is your ancestors’ dwelling.\" He wept silently. Pointing to a mound, they said, \"This is your ancestors’ grave.\" He could not restrain his sobs. His companions burst into laughter, saying, \"This is Jin—we deceived you before.\" The man was overcome with shame.\n\nWhen at last he reached Yan and truly saw his ancestors’ dwelling and grave, his sorrow had already subsided and could not arise again. For the heart is moved by what it first encounters; upon seeing it deeply a second time, it regards it as ordinary. Moreover, one’s homeland is meant to be a place of joy in life, yet the nearer he drew, the more his distress grew, until at last he could only weep—where was the joy in living?\n\nWhat he had taken for Yan was not Yan at all, but merely a city of Jin. They had deceived him with falsehood, and he had believed it as truth. From the deceivers’ perspective, this was truly cause for mockery. Thus we know that what people call inner and outer, near and far, joy and anger, sorrow and delight, are no different from the Yan man’s deception. In their attachments to near and far, sorrow and joy, they too are surely laughed at by the Creator, just as the Yan man was.\n\nIf one could awaken to the unreality of such things, one would surely reflect: in times when sorrow and grief arise, how could they persist? Yet near and far do not lie in things but in oneself; truth and falsehood do not lie in circumstances but in the heart. When the heart is true, even the false becomes true; when the heart is deluded, even the true becomes false.\n\nHad the people of Jin never revealed their deception, the Yan man’s emotions would never have changed. But once he knew he had been deceived, even when he truly saw his ancestors’ dwelling and grave, his sorrow grew faint. Why? The human heart is not inherently untrue, but once led astray by others, it cannot return to truth. Thus the Yan man’s true feelings, once scattered, could never be restored. Though later they came to him in sincerity, he examined them for falsehood, and even when he forced himself to grieve, he could not—how could he not be cautious?\n\nTracing the teachings of Laozi and Zhuangzi, we find their great aim was to anchor the people in nameless simplicity, preventing them from being swayed by falsehood—not to govern them after their nature had already been corrupted. Thus the *Daodejing* concludes with nameless simplicity, teaching that one should not desire stillness, and the world will naturally turn toward uprightness. The *King Mu* chapter ends with this as well.\n\nThe *King Mu* commentary: From the August Thearch down to the achievements of kings, though it is said the Dao descended repeatedly, the responses of emperors and kings to the world all arose from the Dao and were the work of sages, differing only in their adaptation to the times. In the age of the Thearch, one could not but perform the works of the Thearch; in the age of the King, one could not but perform the works of the King. Governance reaches its end in the works of the King, and even the enduring virtue of the worthy nearly attains it. Thus Yu, Tang, Wen, and Wu all performed the works of kings. Qi’s worthiness was sufficient to carry on Yu’s Dao, and King Cheng’s mediocrity was enough to preserve the legacy of Wen and Wu.\n\nBy the time of King Mu, the Dao was insufficient to be transmitted, and the marvel of transforming others did not fill his virtue but harmonized with music—from this point, the Zhou Dao declined. In speaking of the Thearch, we speak of its flourishing; in speaking of the King, we speak of its decline—this is the principle of beginning and end.\n\nMoreover, the virtue of the Five Thearchs and the achievements of the Three Kings, though their Dao was profound and constant, were at times illusory, like a dream. Thus this chapter vividly illustrates the principle of dreaming and waking, as if there were an ancient, wild land where people took their dreams as reality, or rustic folk who remained awake and never slept. Those who exhaust their thoughts by day dream nightly of being servants; those who labor their bodies by day dream nightly of being lords. As for the dispute over the deer, waking and dreaming become indistinguishable.\n\nThe traces of sages in responding to the world are like this. If one can discern the way of waking and dreaming, one knows that those who suffer delusion are not deluded by nature, nor are those who suffer forgetfulness forgetful by nature. Right and wrong, beauty and ugliness, are the same in the Dao. The transformations of the Dao, virtue, and achievement are all one in the end.\n\nThe dust and chaff of the world suffice to mold even Yao and Shun with abundance—how much more the achievements of kings? Tracing the origins of governance, it began with the Three Sovereigns. In that era, the Dao was left to nurture the world, and the people used knotted cords for records. At rest, they were at ease; in motion, they were content—this was the height of good governance.\n\nYet once the Dao was set aside for governance, the turning of the times inevitably led to the virtue of the emperors. The rule of the emperors—such as the Yellow Emperor, Yao, and Shun, who governed the world by merely draping their robes—was indeed flourishing, yet their virtue was already manifest. It must progress to the kingship of Tang and Wu, where all recognize the kingly achievements appearing in the time of Yu of Xia, though none realize its beginnings trace back to before the Three Sovereigns, and its remnants endure for a thousand generations thereafter.\n\nThus, the descent of the Dao is like water leaving its source: its flow is ceaseless, and as it drifts ever farther from its origin, it can never return. Zhuangzi spoke of the Yu clan as those who \"summoned benevolence and righteousness to disturb the world,\" and of the sages as those who \"could not bear the harm of one age but thereby sowed the calamities of ten thousand generations\"—this is what he meant.\n\nNevertheless, the sage who can wield the Dao to guide the times, not following the world’s descent, may bring even the kingship of the Zhou dynasty to a state where the people’s customs differ not from the age of utmost virtue. This is the teaching bequeathed by Master Liezi, a hope for all generations, an encounter that may come at any dawn or dusk.\n\n*Explication of the Perfect Dao and Realized Virtue, Scroll Six—Concluded*\n*Explication of the Perfect Dao and Realized Virtue, Scroll Seven*\n\nMinister Jiang Yu, an inner student of the Hangzhou Prefecture Academy of Song, respectfully presents:\n\nWhen Confucius was at leisure in his chambers, Zigong entered to attend him and saw him wearing a troubled expression. Zigong dared not inquire. *Explanation:* \"At leisure after court\" refers to the time after retiring from official duties; \"at leisure in his chambers\" means he had just returned from public service to take his meal. Thus his concern lay in governing the world and bequeathing guidance to future generations—this shows that though the sage was at leisure, his heart was never absent from the royal house, so steadfast was his loyalty.\n\nTo ask is to express what the heart desires to do but has not yet achieved. Confucius’ sorrow was something even Yan Hui could not fathom, how much less Zigong, who fell short of him? Thus he dared not ask.\n\nHe went out and told Yan Hui. Yan Hui took up his zither and sang. When Confucius heard it, he indeed summoned Yan Hui to enter. *Explanation:* Yan Hui’s taking up the zither and singing was meant for the Master to hear. That he indeed summoned Yan Hui to enter shows that the sage’s teaching was tireless.\n\nHe asked, “Why do you alone rejoice?”\nYan Hui replied, “Why does the Master alone grieve?”\nConfucius said, “First speak of your aspiration.”\nYan Hui said, “I once heard the Master say: ‘Rejoice in Heaven and know fate, thus one has no sorrow’—this is why I rejoice.”\nConfucius, his expression suddenly grave, said, “Was there truly such a saying? Your understanding is mistaken.”\n\n\"This was my teaching of former days—pray let my present words be taken as correct. You merely know that rejoicing in Heaven and knowing fate bring no sorrow, yet do not know that rejoicing in Heaven and knowing fate entail a sorrow of great magnitude.\"\n\n*Explanation:* Yan Hui’s joy lies in the Dao, while Confucius’s sorrow concerns humanity. From the perspective of the multitude, only Yan Hui is uniquely joyful; from Yan Hui’s perspective, only Confucius is uniquely sorrowful. What Heaven bestows, one rejoices in and does not refuse—this is called rejoicing in Heaven. What fate ordains, one follows and does not resist—this is called knowing fate. To rejoice in Heaven yet not know fate, or to know fate yet not rejoice in Heaven, is insufficient to be free from sorrow. Though one who rejoices in Heaven and knows fate finds joy even in poverty, the joy of such a one is not in poverty or prosperity—this is why there is no sorrow. Yan Hui has attained this Dao, and thus, dwelling amid sorrows that others cannot bear, he remains unchanged in his joy.\n\nYet Confucius, having lived sixty years, underwent sixty transformations. What he once affirmed, he later deemed mistaken. To take rejoicing in Heaven and knowing fate as freedom from sorrow was his former affirmation. To regard rejoicing in Heaven and knowing fate as a sorrow of great magnitude is his present teaching. Compared to Confucius, Yan Hui grasped his conduct but not the reason for his conduct—hence he took up the zither and sang, yet could not share the sage’s sorrow.\n\nMoreover, both are the words of a sage—how could there truly be contradiction or discord? Adapting to the times and suiting change, I merely ask that the present teaching be taken as correct. As for true joy and true knowledge, how can the words of past and present be distinguished?\n\nNow I tell you the truth: cultivate the self, accept poverty or prosperity, know that going and coming are not of the self, and banish disturbance from the mind—this is what you call rejoicing in Heaven and knowing fate without sorrow. Formerly, I cultivated the *Odes* and *Documents*, rectified rites and music, intending to govern the world and bequeath it to future generations—not merely to cultivate myself or govern the state of Lu. Yet the rulers and ministers of Lu daily lost their proper order; benevolence and righteousness grew ever weaker, human nature ever more shallow. If this Dao cannot prevail in one state or one generation, how much less in the world and future ages?\n\nI first realized that the *Odes*, *Documents*, rites, and music could not save the world from disorder, yet I did not know the means to reform them—this is the sorrow of one who rejoices in Heaven and knows fate. Nevertheless, I have grasped it now. The joy and knowledge of which I speak are not what the ancients meant by joy and knowledge. Without joy and without knowledge—this is true joy and true knowledge. Thus there is nothing not joyful, nothing not known, nothing not sorrowful, nothing not done. What need is there to abandon the *Odes*, *Documents*, rites, and music? Why reform them?\n\n*Explanation:* The sage is the utmost of virtue and the perfection of the Dao. To call one a sage is to say that the mind is congealed and form released, with nothing cherished and nothing feared—what sorrow could there be? Even the benevolent can be free from sorrow, how much more Confucius, who embodied the sage’s consummation? If he were not free from sorrow, he could not be called a sage. To say the sage has sorrow is to misunderstand the sage.\n\nYet now, manifesting such great sorrow in countenance—this is because the sage is the linchpin of the ten thousand things, the one on whom all transformation depends, and who bears the weight of the world. If, by rejoicing in Heaven and knowing fate, I cultivate myself, accept poverty or prosperity, know that going and coming are not of the self, and still disturbances in the mind, then I am without sorrow—but how can I ensure that all the people are without sorrow? If the people are not entirely free from sorrow, how can the sage alone be without sorrow? His sorrow is not only for the present age but extends to future generations. The ages to come are endless, the people’s sorrows inexhaustible, and the sage’s sorrow likewise without end—is this not a sorrow of great magnitude?\n\nMoreover, I cultivated the *Odes* and *Documents*, rectified rites and music, seeking to bring order, yet the Dao did not prevail. Seeing that the *Odes*, *Documents*, rites, and music could not save the world from disorder, I thought to reform them but did not know the way—how could I be without sorrow? Why is this? The Six Classics are the traces left by the former kings—are they the essence of those traces? The footprints are what the shoes produce, but are the footprints the shoes? Though the traces cannot be clung to, the shoes cannot be discarded either. Thus, the *Odes*, *Documents*, rites, and music—if abandoned, there is no means to govern; if followed, they cannot bring governance. Now, to take rejoicing in Heaven and knowing fate as freedom from sorrow is to abandon the shoes along with the traces—how then can governance be achieved?\n\nTherefore, to call it rejoicing in Heaven is still to have something rejoiced in. To call it knowing fate is still to have something known. Having something rejoiced in necessarily entails sorrow; having something known necessarily entails omission. Only by attaining what is called true joy and true knowledge can there be no joy and no knowledge. Without joy and without knowledge, there is nothing not joyful, nothing not known, nothing not sorrowful, nothing not done—joy and sorrow both forgotten. Acting without acting, all is relinquished. The *Odes*, *Documents*, rites, and music need not be abandoned or reformed, yet the world can be governed and future ages bequeathed. This is what the *Book of Changes* means by \"stirring the ten thousand things yet not sharing the sage’s sorrow.\" This is why Confucius edited the *Odes*, established the *Documents*, appended the *Book of Changes*, and composed the *Spring and Autumn*—earnestly transmitting these teachings.\n\nYan Hui bowed northward and said, \"I too have grasped it.\" He went out and told Zigong. Zigong was lost in bewilderment, returned home, and brooded for seven days without sleep or food, until his bones stood out. Yan Hui went again to explain it to him, whereupon he returned to Confucius’s gate, strumming the zither and chanting the classics all day without cease.\n\n*Explanation:* Yan Hui once asked Confucius to let him go to Wei, but Confucius thought it perilous, saying, \"You would likely go and be punished.\" Was this perhaps because he had not yet grasped the meaning of rejoicing in Heaven and knowing fate as entailing a sorrow of great magnitude?\n\nAs for Yan Hui’s saying that \"when employed, he acts; when set aside, he withdraws\"—this being the same as Confucius—it was because he had attained this understanding. As for Zigong, though his wisdom sufficed to recognize the sage, he had not yet heard of the sage’s Heavenly Dao, and thus fell into bewilderment and self-loss. Nevertheless, his deep reflection over time, enduring without sleep or food until his bones stood out, showed that he had forgotten his self and merged with principle, making it possible to instruct him in the sage’s Way. Thus, upon receiving Yan Hui’s explanation, he released his doubts and returned to the Master’s gate, where he spent his days strumming the zither and chanting the classics. In his music, he found joy; in his recitations, he understood that the *Odes* and *Documents* need not be discarded.\n\nA minister from Chen, on a diplomatic mission to Lu, privately visited the house of the Shusun clan. The Shusun lord said, \"There is a sage in our state.\" The minister asked, \"Is it not Kong Qiu?\" \"It is,\" he replied. \"How do you know he is a sage?\" The Shusun lord said, \"I once heard Yan Hui say, ‘Kong Qiu can set aside the mind and employ the body.’\"\n\nThe minister from Chen said, \"There is also a sage in our state—did you not know?\" \"Who is this sage?\" he asked. \"Among Lao Dan’s disciples was one named Kang Cangzi, who attained Lao Dan’s Dao and could see with his ears and hear with his eyes.\" When the Duke of Lu heard this, he was greatly astonished and sent his highest minister with lavish gifts to invite him. Kang Cangzi accepted the invitation and arrived. The Duke of Lu humbly questioned him. Kang Cangzi said, \"The transmission is false. I can see and hear without using my ears and eyes, but I cannot alter the functions of ears and eyes.\"\n\nThe Duke of Lu said, \"This is even more extraordinary—what is your Way? I earnestly wish to hear it.\"\n\n*Explanation:* Human perception and hearing do not depart from the body. Even the sage has no means to differ from others in this; only the sage’s perception and hearing rely on the body to manifest clarity, not being entirely bound by it. Precisely because he is not bound by the body, he can set aside the mind; precisely because he relies on the body, he still employs its form. \"Setting aside the mind\" corresponds to Kang Cangzi’s seeing and hearing without using ears and eyes; \"employing the form\" corresponds to his inability to alter the functions of ears and eyes. Since Kang Cangzi’s sageliness is no different from Confucius’s, we know that Confucius’s Dao is no different from the Old Master’s Dao.\n\nKang Cangzi said, \"My body unites with the mind, the mind unites with qi, qi unites with spirit, and spirit unites with nothingness.\"\n\n*Explanation:* In the Great Beginning, there was nothingness—nothingness without name—yet spirit moved within it. The Great Beginning presaged the inception of qi; qi harmonized and gave rise to life, and with life came the mind. The balance of creation is bestowed upon humanity in this way. The difference between the mad and the sage lies in what they unite with. The sage ever ascends and unites with nothingness; united with nothingness, there is nowhere he does not unite. The common person ever descends and unites with things; united with things, there is nowhere he is not obstructed. When the body unites with the mind, one forgets the form; when the mind unites with qi, one forgets thought; when qi unites with spirit, one becomes a single undifferentiated qi, sagely and unknowable. Yet though spirit is wondrous, it has not departed from being. Only when spirit unites with nothingness does it merge with the Great Void, neither ending in the vast nor neglecting the minute, with no thing escaping its mirror. Whether it be the faintest existence or the faintest sound—though distant in the eight wilds or near at the brows and lashes—whatever comes to me, I must know it. Yet this is not the awareness of the seven apertures and four limbs, nor the knowledge of the six viscera within the chest and abdomen; it is self-knowing alone.\n\nThe Duke of Lu was overjoyed. Another day, he told this to Zhongni, who smiled but did not answer.\n\n*Explanation:* The eight wilds are the farthest reaches, where mountains and rivers spread and the ten thousand things intermingle, beyond the scope of sight and hearing. The brows and lashes are the nearest, where the viscera reside within and the orifices without, yet knowledge and perception cannot perceive themselves. When spirit unites with nothingness, the body merges with emptiness, and the appearances of things dissolve into the apex—all becomes the Great Void. Though the tiniest insect may be as visible as the slopes of Mount Song, how much more so the faintest existence? Though the faintest sound may be as audible as thunder, how much more so the faintest tone? The Old Master said, \"The farther it extends, the less one knows.\" This principle accords with that. Nevertheless, the sage does not strive for excessive knowledge; whatever comes to me, I know it. Only by not pursuing external knowledge does one remain unaware and unknowing, yet one’s knowledge arises naturally, with nothing unknown. If one’s knowledge were obtained through perception, it would not depart from the body; if obtained through thought, it would not transcend reflection. How then could one know all without exception? Kang Cangzi’s words exhaust the matter—so perfectly aligned with the heart that no sound could contain it. Thus, when the Duke of Lu told this to Zhongni, Zhongni smiled but did not answer.\n\nThe Grand Steward of Shang visited Confucius and asked, \"Is Qiu a sage?\" Confucius said, \"How would Qiu dare claim sageliness? Yet Qiu is one who has broadly studied and widely retained knowledge.\" The Grand Steward asked, \"Were the Three Kings sages?\" Confucius said, \"The Three Kings were good at employing wisdom and courage—whether they were sages, Qiu does not know.\" He asked, \"Were the Five Emperors sages?\" Confucius said, \"The Five Emperors were good at employing benevolence and righteousness—whether they were sages, Qiu does not know.\" He asked, \"Were the Three Sovereigns sages?\" Confucius said, \"The Three Sovereigns were good at following the times—whether they were sages, Qiu does not know.\"\n\nThe Grand Steward of Shang was greatly astonished.\n\n*Explanation:* The Dao is one alone. From the Sovereigns it descended to the Emperors; Yao transmitted it to Shun in this way, and Shun to Yu. Tang, Wen, and Wu were all ancient sages. Yet the simplicity of Fuxi, the yielding of Yao and Shun, the contention of Tang and Wu, and Confucius’s uncrowned kingship—all were responses to the times out of necessity, and thus the sageliness within them was concealed.\n\nThus, when Confucius was questioned by the Grand Steward of Shang, regarding himself he said, \"I dare not,\" and regarding others, \"I do not know.\" Nevertheless, those who skillfully follow the times manifest the Dao; those who skillfully employ benevolence and righteousness make virtue evident; those who skillfully apply wisdom and courage enrich their achievements; and those who broadly study and amass knowledge exhaust principle and fulfill their nature—all are the affairs of the sage, merely that he dare not claim to know.\n\nMoreover, the Sovereigns descended to the Emperors, and the Emperors descended to the Kings. The Grand Steward of Shang was but an assistant to the kings; how could he, still occupied with following and upholding their governance, suddenly be told that one does not know whether the Emperors or Sovereigns were sages? How could he not be astonished?\n\nHe asked, \"Then who is a sage?\" Confucius changed his countenance and paused, then said, \"In the West, there is a sage.\"\n\n*Explanation:* The so-called sage is the Dao of the Sovereigns, the virtue of the Emperors, the achievements of the Kings, and the culmination of Confucius. What Confucius told the Grand Steward of Shang were all the affairs of the sage. The reason he did not claim sageliness was that the sage, in his sageliness, partakes of the numinous and is unknowable. When the sage acts and presages transformation, he becomes visible to all things. Yet what makes him a sage remains concealed; one may know his governance but not his Dao.\n\nThe Grand Steward of Shang sought the sage outside the sage—his confusion was profound. Confucius changed his countenance, intending to rectify his demeanor and enlighten him. When the change in countenance and pause brought no understanding, it became clear he would never grasp the words. Thus, Confucius told him, \"In the West, there is a sage.\"\n\nThe so-called \"person of the West\" refers to the sage who does not depart from the numinous, the root origin of Heaven that has not yet presaged transformation. The West is the direction of returning to life and reverting to one’s nature. Moreover, the Way of Heaven moves from the West to the North; only upon reaching the North is the return to life complete. When *Liezi* speaks of the Dao of the sage, it often alludes to the West, aiming to dispel the decadence of the declining Zhou and the excesses of culture, urging the people to abandon superficiality and embrace substance. Thus, it speaks of the West as the origin of transformation and the destination of Lao Dan’s departure.\n\nAs for the distinction of the North, it will soon give rise to the arousal of *Zhen*. Such is the purport of these words.\n\nWithout governance yet without disorder, without speech yet self-trusting, without transformation yet self-acting—so vast and boundless that the people cannot name it. I, Qiu, suspect this to be sageliness, yet do not know whether it is truly sageliness or truly not sageliness.\n\nTo explain: The world originally had no affairs; those people abided in constant spontaneity. If one cannot bear the harms of an age and thus governs it, one disrupts the repose of ten thousand generations without hope of remedy. Therefore, those who respond as emperors and kings do so through the Dao, observing the transformations of words and the destinies of things to avoid entanglement. Yet where there are words, there will be those who doubt them; where there is transformation, there will be those who resist it. If names exist amid order and chaos, one strays ever farther from sageliness. Only that which is so vast and boundless that the people cannot name it may be likened to sageliness.\n\nOld Master said: \"The Dao is ever nameless and without beginning,\" for the Dao ought not to be named. The sage is the utmost of the Dao; if it can be named, it is not the Dao. From Fuxi to Confucius, have their responses to the world not been nearly akin to selling fame and reputation across the realm? No wonder Confucius did not recognize his own sageliness.\n\nYet if one takes the inability to be named as sageliness, then to name it \"nameless\" is already to have named it—how can it remain unnameable? That which ultimately cannot be named is the true nature of the Dao. To name it \"unnameable\" and thereby allude to its namelessness is the sage’s unavoidable concession. Thus, though Confucius said, \"In the West there is a sage,\" he ultimately declared he did not know whether it was truly sageliness or truly not sageliness.\n\nNevertheless, this \"unnameable\" does not mean emptiness, non-action, or detachment from all designation as nothingness. Rather, it is to act without being burdened by action, as if nameable yet without the substance of a name. Thus, Confucius once praised Yao as \"so vast and boundless that the people could not name him,\" yet did not deny his towering achievements.\n\nConsider Confucius’ words to the Grand Steward of Shang: at first, he did not know him to be a sage; in the end, he still doubted whether he was a sage. None knew his traces at the beginning, nor his subtleties at the end—sageliness that cannot be known, therein it resides. The Grand Steward of Shang fell silent and pondered in his heart, \"Kong Qiu has deceived me!\"\n\nTo explain: Only where there is a fixed standard can deception occur. The Grand Steward of Shang, confronted with Confucius’ words, found his eloquence insufficient to refute their principle and his sincerity insufficient to trust his Dao, so he pondered in his heart that he had been deceived.\n\nZixia asked Confucius, \"What sort of person is Yan Hui?\"\nThe Master said, \"Hui’s benevolence surpasses my own.\"\n\"What sort of person is Zigong?\"\n\"The acuity of Ci surpasses my own.\"\n\"What sort of person is Zilu?\"\n\"The courage of You surpasses my own.\"\n\"What sort of person is Zizhang?\"\n\"The solemnity of Shi surpasses my own.\"\n\nZixia rose from his mat and asked, \"Then why do these four serve you?\"\nThe Master said, \"Sit. I will tell you.\"\n\nHui excels in benevolence but cannot return to simplicity; Ci excels in eloquence but cannot be reticent; You excels in courage but cannot be timid; Shi excels in solemnity but cannot be harmonious. Were I to exchange my own qualities for the sum of theirs, I would not consent. This is why they serve me without divided loyalty.\n\nTo explain: The virtues of these disciples are like yin and yang; the Dao of the sage is like the harmonizing qi. The harmonizing qi is subtler than yin and yang, yet yin and yang draw upon it. Though each of the four possesses qualities surpassing my own, I would not consent to exchange my own for the sum of theirs. Thus, their excellence is precisely what makes them partial, and their deficiency is precisely what makes them wondrous—this is why they serve me without divided loyalty.\n\nMaster Liezi, having taken Huqiu Zilin as his teacher and befriended Boshi Maoren, then dwelled in Nanguo. Those who followed him there came daily in such numbers that they could not be counted.\n\nTo explain: After Liezi had advanced in the Dao of these two masters and returned riding the wind, his own cultivation had reached its utmost perfection. Yet he could not bear to keep the Master’s Dao solely for his own benefit, so he took up residence in Nanguo. Nanguo was a bustling district within the city walls. Once he had emerged to engage with the world, he could not prevent people from flocking to him, and the sandals outside his door piled up. Nevertheless, Master Liezi remained subtle in his way.\n\nEach morning, he debated with others, and there was nothing he did not hear. Yet for twenty years, he shared a wall with Nanguozi and never paid him a formal visit. When they met on the road, their eyes seemed not to see each other. The disciples and servants in his household took it for granted that Liezi and Nanguozi were rivals.\n\nTo explain: Nanguozi embodied the subtlety of the Dao, dwelling amid the dust without being stained by it—this was why he and Liezi shared a wall. The Dao of these two masters was perfectly round and wondrously attuned, ever meeting without seeking, seeing without appearing. Why, then, would they need to pay formal visits? Not only did they not visit each other, but even when they met on the road, their eyes seemed not to see. For those who study the Dao, to have the Dao present at a glance is already the utmost. Yet to rely on such a glance is still not free from perception. Only when they met and their eyes seemed not to see was perception transcended. Without mutual engagement, without action, self and other both forgotten—Liezi’s Dao was perfected in this. Thus it is said: Master Liezi was also subtle. Subtle in that his words never departed from the Dao, his heart refined and wondrous.\n\nYet if each morning he debated with others and heard everything, was this love of debate? It was only because of those who followed him that he could not avoid it. His disciples and servants, seeing Liezi engaged in debate, took his lack of formal visits to Nanguozi as proof of rivalry.\n\nA man from Chu came and asked Liezi, “In what way is your master a match for Nanguozi?”\nLiezi said, “Nanguozi’s appearance is full, his heart empty. His ears do not hear, his eyes do not see, his mouth does not speak, his heart does not know, his form is without fear. What could he possibly do?”\n\nTo explain: “Appearance full” means his cultivation preserved his form without decline. “Heart empty” means he forgot his heart and things did not linger. “Ears do not hear” means he heard only himself. “Eyes do not see” means he saw only himself. “Mouth does not speak” means his words were not mere words. “Heart does not know” means true knowing is without knowing. “Form without fear” means he had no apprehensions or taboos. One like this has forgotten both teacher and disciple. What, then, could he do when he went forth?\n\n“Nevertheless,” Liezi said, “let us go together.” He gathered forty disciples and set out.\n\nTo explain: Liezi had already spoken of Nanguozi’s subtlety, but fearing his followers would remain deeply confused about the ultimate Dao, he went with them to witness it firsthand. The forty disciples who accompanied him were like the many who come together with others.\n\nWhen they saw Nanguozi, he seemed indeed like a lifeless effigy, impossible to engage. Looking back at Liezi, his form and spirit were not paired, and he could not be grouped with others.\n\nTo explain: Spirit gives rise to form, and form gives rise to spirit. The pairing of form and spirit is what gives rise to human life. When form and spirit are not paired, it is as if one has the form of a human but not the feelings—this is the kind of lifeless effigy Nanguozi resembled. A lifeless effigy is a clay figurine. One like this stands apart from things and people, solitary in his uniqueness. Thus he could not be engaged, nor could he be grouped with others.\n\nSuddenly, Nanguozi pointed to one of Liezi’s disciples in the rear rank and spoke with him, his manner joyful and forthright, as if he were the very embodiment of strength. Liezi’s disciples were astonished. When they returned home, all wore expressions of doubt.\n\nTo explain: In its stillness, the Qian hexagram is single-minded; in its movement, it is direct. *Kankan* describes its harmony. To be *kankan* yet forthright, as if embodying the strength of Qian, is to embody the Dao of Qian, presiding over the transformations of the myriad things and guiding them into great harmony. Suddenly pointing to a disciple in the rear rank and speaking with him was a response to encounter, not a deliberate act. His Dao was vast, so they were astonished. When trust is insufficient, there is distrust. Thus, upon returning, they all wore expressions of doubt—quite different from those who withdraw to reflect privately and thereby gain insight.\n\nLiezi said: “Those who grasp the meaning do not speak; those who advance in knowledge also do not speak. To use non-speech as speech is still speech; to use non-knowing as knowing is still knowing. Non-speech and not speaking, non-knowing and not knowing—these are also speech and knowing. They are also without anything not spoken, without anything not known, and also without anything spoken, without anything known. It is only thus. Why this groundless astonishment?”\n\nTo explain: Writing cannot fully express words, and words cannot fully express meaning—thus those who grasp the meaning do not speak. The knowing do not speak; those who speak do not know—thus those who advance in knowledge also do not speak.\n\nYet to regard non-speech and non-knowing as correct is to sever oneself from things. To take not-speaking and not-knowing as right is still not to forget the self. To take speech and knowing as right is to gain but shallow understanding. Speaking of speech, one may speak all day yet never truly speak. Not speaking of non-speech, one may remain silent all day yet never truly cease speaking. Nothing is left unspoken, nothing is left unknown—yet nothing is spoken, nothing is known. Such was the meeting of these two masters. This alone is the constant of the Dao, nothing extraordinary—why then this groundless astonishment?\n\nAll that Liezi ever said comes to this, in agreement with the Old Master’s words: “How do I know the nature of all under heaven? By this.” Scholars who grasp this may awaken to the supreme Dao; beyond this, duality is not the truth. From this we see clearly the teachings of Liezi.\n\nWhen Liezi first studied under Old Shang, after three years his mind dared not entertain judgments of right and wrong, his mouth dared not speak of profit and harm—only then did Old Shang deign to glance at him. After five years, his mind again pondered right and wrong, his mouth again spoke of profit and harm—only then did Old Shang begin to relax his brow and smile. After seven years, whatever his mind thought held no right or wrong, whatever his mouth spoke held no profit or harm—only then did his master draw him near to share the same mat. After nine years, whether his mind wandered or his mouth uttered, he no longer knew his own right or wrong, profit or harm, nor that of others. Inner and outer had merged. Then his eyes became like ears, his ears like nose, his nose like mouth—all senses were undifferentiated. His mind congealed, his form dissolved, flesh and bone fused as one. He no longer sensed the body’s support, the feet’s tread, the mind’s thoughts, or the words’ concealment. Thus alone is principle nowhere hidden.\n\nTo explain: The madman and the sage dwell in different realms, yet upon close examination, their difference is but a hair’s breadth. The mind seeks to congeal but scatters; the form seeks release but remains bound. The mind races without return, the form is divided without communication. The mind is enslaved by the form, the form is driven by the mind. Even within a single body, the eye knows not the ear, the ear knows not the nose, the nose knows not the mouth—liver and gallbladder may as well be Chu and Yue. How much more so for the principles of the myriad things? He no longer senses the body’s support or the feet’s tread because his form has dissolved. He no longer knows the mind’s thoughts or the words’ concealment because his mind has congealed. Thus the ears, eyes, and nose mutually illuminate one another; flesh and bone fuse completely, merging with the spirit’s utmost emptiness. Whatever approaches me, my mind knows it—principle is nowhere hidden for this reason.\n\nLiezi once spoke of riding the wind in this way, and again of principle being nowhere hidden. Mastery of the wind lies within me; illumination of principle lies in things. Though their functions differ, if one attains this, there is nowhere one cannot go. To speak of the Dao and reach the point where seeing and hearing do not rely on eyes and ears, where flesh and bone fuse completely—this may be called wondrous, yet it seems beyond what learning can achieve. Yet the reason it is so lies in first daring not to think of right and wrong, not to speak of profit and harm, advancing step by step until the great wonder of nine years is attained. How then can scholars regard the supreme Dao as unattainable as climbing the sky and not strive for it?\n\nInitially, Liezi loved to wander.\nTo explain: The Dao of wandering is neither within nor without, nor does it dwell between the two. It moves above the myriad things, carefree between heaven and earth—this is the fullness and perfection of the Dao. Thus Liezi loved to wander, and Master Hu regarded wandering as the ultimate.\n\nMaster Huqiu asked: “Liezi loves to wander—what does he love about it?”\nLiezi replied: “The joy of wandering lies in playing with the unchanging. Others wander to observe what they see; I wander to observe what transforms. Wandering, wandering—none can distinguish this wandering.”\n\nMaster Huqiu said: “Liezi’s wandering is fundamentally the same as others’, yet you say it is fundamentally different? Whatever one sees is always seen in its transformations. Playing with the unchanging nature of things, one does not realize one’s own unchanging nature. Focusing on external wandering, one does not focus on internal observation. Those who wander externally seek completeness in things; those who observe internally find sufficiency in themselves. Finding sufficiency in oneself is the perfection of wandering; seeking completeness in things is the failure of wandering.”\n\nThereupon Liezi never left his home for the rest of his life, considering himself ignorant of wandering.\nTo explain: Observing what one sees, one perceives the phenomena of things—light and dark, passage and obstruction, mountains and rivers, people—seeing their forms as not uniform. Observing what transforms, one looks at those same phenomena, seeing the great and the small, the existent and the nonexistent, knowing their ceaseless change. Yet emptiness does not complete seeing, and seeing does not depart from things. All that is seen is change, and change does not depart from seeing. Observing seeing and observing change are equally confined by things—what difference is there? Moreover, seeing and what is seen are equally illusory, both revolving with things. Seeking completeness through the endless transformations of things only distances one further from the Dao. Thus external wandering that seeks completeness in things is not as good as internal observation that finds sufficiency in oneself.\n\nThe so-called internal observation is not to seek seeing apart from things. Within this single body of mine, I allow things to shift and transform on their own. Things turn as things, and I do not chase after them. Within the body that pursues change, the nature of perfect clarity remains unaltered. Within this single nature, all transformations are fully encompassed. Without needing to look around, is this not the perfection of wandering? The deluded do not know to find sufficiency in themselves and regard observing the transformations of things as superior to merely observing what is seen.\n\nLiezi sought to illuminate the subtlety of perfect wandering, thus positioning himself amidst the transformations of things. Borrowing the words of Master Huzǐ to dispel his obstructions, he remained within all his life, believing himself ignorant of wandering.\n\nMaster Huqiū said: \"Is this not the perfection of wandering?\"\nThe perfection of wandering knows not where it goes;\nThe perfection of observation knows not what it sees.\nAll things wander,\nAll things observe—\nThis is what I call wandering,\nThis is what I call observation.\nThus it is said: \"Is this not the perfection of wandering? Is this not the perfection of wandering?\"\n\nExplanation:\nMencius said: \"All things are complete within me. To turn inward and find sincerity—no joy is greater.\" This is what is meant by internal observation finding sufficiency in oneself. Having mastered internal observation, one does not depart from the ground of one’s nature yet pervades all within the seas—how could one know where one goes? One does not depart from the tip of an autumn hair yet clearly observes the ten thousand transformations—how could one know what one sees? Thus all things wander, all things observe.\n\nFor one who, through internal observation of the root, enables all things under heaven to wander and observe—is this not perfection? The reason for repeating \"Is this not the perfection of wandering?\" is that within subtlety there is yet subtler depth, and words cannot exhaust its perfection—akin to the *Book of Changes* saying of the *Qian* hexagram, \"Is it not the sage alone?\" That *Zhuangzi* begins with \"Free and Easy Wandering\"—is it not for its perfection?\n\n*Explication of the Perfect Virtue of the Impalpable Dao, Scroll Seven—Concluded*\n*Explication of the Perfect Virtue of the Impalpable Dao, Scroll Eight*\n\nSubmitted by the Inner College Student of Hangzhou Prefecture, Your Servant Jiang Yu:\n\nWhen Zhongni and Long Shu spoke with Wen Zhi, [Long Shu] said: \"Your arts are subtle indeed. I suffer from an affliction—can you cure it?\" Wen Zhi replied: \"I await your command.\"\n\n*Explication*: The dragon is a creature that ascends and descends at will, unbound by restraint or domestication, capable of transformation. To call him \"Long Shu\" is not so profound as the \"Old Dragon\" spoken of in the *Zhuangzi*, who embodies perfect transformation. Perhaps Long Shu’s affliction stems from his sagely wisdom. Yet first, he speaks of the symptoms of his malady.\n\nLong Shu said: \"In my village, praise brings me no honor; in my state, slander brings me no disgrace. Gain does not gladden me, nor loss grieve me. I regard life as death, wealth as poverty, others as swine, and myself as but another man. Dwelling in my home, I see it as an inn for travelers; gazing upon my village, I view it as a land of barbarians. These many afflictions render me unmoved by rank or reward, unshaken by punishment or threat, unchanged by prosperity or harm, untouched by sorrow or joy. Thus, I cannot serve a lord, befriend kin, govern a wife and children, or command servants. What is this malady? And by what method can it be cured?\"\n\nThe Explanation states: The Dao is that which nothing fails to penetrate. Having already attained the Dao of sagely wisdom, one may employ its truth to govern the self, and its surplus to order the state, while its unadorned essence may govern all under Heaven—nothing lies beyond its reach. Yet in Long Shu’s Dao, honor and disgrace, sorrow and joy cannot burden his heart; life and death, poverty and wealth cannot alter his thoughts. Within, he forgets the self; without, he forgets things. Neither punishments nor rewards sway him, neither profit nor harm change him, neither grief nor joy move him. His Dao has reached its utmost, its perfection—nothing can be added to it. Now, that his Dao cannot serve a lord, befriend kin, govern a wife and children, or command servants—this is to mistake the sage’s unwavering adherence to the root for the error of separating from transformation and dividing it into two.\n\nTo inwardly observe the root and outwardly perceive transformation—this alternation of emergence and withdrawal is neither different nor the same. If one were to take the great root and great origin of the Dao within oneself and extend it to govern all under Heaven and the state, flowing with things and harmonizing with their waves, then though one might encounter success or failure, creation or destruction, nothing would fail to engage one, yet one would never lose the Dao of supreme tranquility, and the myriad things would all attain their proper order. Yet Long Shu seeks to preserve the truth of his self-governance without engagement, hoping thereby to bring order to the myriad things—how can this be possible? This is why sagely wisdom is called an affliction.\n\nWen Zhi then instructed Long Shu to stand with his back to the light, while Wen Zhi himself faced the light from behind to observe him. The Explanation states: Commanding him to stand with his back to the light was to make him turn inward. Observing him from behind while facing the light was to examine whether he could remain without a mind responsive to things. After a moment, he said: Ah! I see your heart now—its square inch of space is empty. You are nearly a sage. Your heart has six apertures flowing freely, yet one remains unopened. Is it perhaps for this reason that you take sagely wisdom as an affliction? This is not something my shallow art can cure.\n\nThe Explanation states: In human life, the six senses join with the self to make seven, all of which the heart itself produces. Long Shu’s Dao levels all things equally—one might say his six apertures flow freely, yet he clings to the truth of his self-governance and cannot extend it to respond to things. Is this not the one aperture that remains unopened? It has been said that the heart and the body are the inner and outer of a single form, ever at odds like spear and shield. When all seven apertures are drilled open, Hun Dun dies; when all seven flow freely, sagely wisdom is complete. Those who embody the Dao regard having a body as the greatest affliction—does this not refer to this?\n\nWhat is called Wen Zhi clings to his patterns to respond to things; the sage is one who perceives the signs of transformation. Thus, Long Shu necessarily sought a method from Wen Zhi.\n\nThat which arises without cause and yet is ever-generating is the Dao. That which arises from life and thus lives, though it may end, does not perish—this is constancy. That which arises from life and yet perishes is misfortune. That which arises with cause and is ever-dying is also the Dao. That which arises from death and thus dies, though it may not yet end, perishes of itself—this too is constancy. That which arises from death and yet lives is good fortune.\n\nThus, that which employs nothing and yet governs life is called the Dao; that which employs the Dao and attains its end is called constancy. That which employs something and thus dies is also called the Dao; that which employs the Dao and attains death is also called constancy.\n\nThe Explanation states: Once born, one should let go and entrust it, not clinging to life—this is to arise without cause and thus live constantly. When death approaches, one should exhaust its course and release it to its end—this is to arise with cause and thus die constantly. To speak of constant life and constant death is to say that though there is death and life, one has in truth never died or lived, and so enters into neither death nor life. This is why it is called the Dao.\n\nTo arise from life and thus live is to comprehend the essence of life, and so though one dies, one does not perish. To arise from death and thus die is to cling to life and lose principle, and so though one lives, one is as if dead. This is the constancy of principle.\n\nTo arise from life and yet perish—Yan’s early death is an example. To arise from death and yet live—Robber Zhi’s longevity is an example. These are matters of good or ill fortune.\n\nSome, though dead, are called spirits because they have attained the Dao; some, though dead, are called ghosts because they follow constancy; some, though dead, are called things—these arise from death and thus live, yet though they live, they are as if dead.\n\nWhen Ji Liang died, Yang Zhu gazed at his gate and sang. When Sui Wu died, Yang Zhu caressed his corpse and wept. When a servant is born, a servant dies—some sing, some weep. The Explanation states: Ji Liang did not dwell as the foremost of things; his Dao was sufficient above to uphold and below to shelter, transcending the waves to ferry the people to a place of no difficulty. Thus, in his death, he had advanced in the Dao of life and death. Therefore, Yang Zhu gazed at his gate and sang.\n\nAs for what is called Sui Wu—Sui as a tree has five calyxes and five bracts, yet its fruit does not sever its source. It is like one who can receive the center and establish destiny. Sui Wu, however, followed the transformations of things, truly unable to receive the center and establish destiny, and so sank into oblivion with things. Thus, in his death, Yang Zhu caressed his corpse and wept.\n\nServants know only to delight in life and hate death, yet do not understand the causes of life and death. Thus, they sing where they should weep and weep where they should sing—all is as it should be. Their singing and weeping alike are met with joy by those who possess the Dao, yet all are equally pitiable.\n\nAlas! In human life, the myriad things are distinguished and ordered, yet even in the slightest smile or frown, whether it accords with measure or not, all follow and become right or wrong. Yet when it comes to the great transformation of life and death, they sing and weep without awareness or awakening—can this not be a cause for great sorrow?\n\nOne whose eyes are about to go blind first sees the autumn down; one whose ears are about to go deaf first hears the gnat in flight; one whose mouth is about to lose its taste first distinguishes the waters of the Zi and the Meng; one whose nose is about to be blocked first detects the scent of burning and decay; one whose body is about to stiffen first hastens to flee and rest; one whose heart is about to be deluded first discerns right and wrong. Thus, when things have not yet arrived, one does not turn back.\n\nA commentary states: Yin and Yang illuminate, cover, and govern one another; the four seasons succeed, give birth to, and destroy one another, following the inherent principles of their sequence and the mutual employment of their cyclical movements. When exhaustion is reached, there is reversion; when an end is reached, there is a beginning—this is the natural principle. Thus, when brightness reaches its extreme, there is blindness; when hearing reaches its extreme, there is deafness; when taste reaches its extreme, there is insipidity; when smell reaches its extreme, there is blockage; when vigor reaches its extreme, there is stiffness; when discernment reaches its extreme, there is delusion. Therefore, withdrawing one’s sight and returning to inner listening, cutting off flavors and removing fragrances, dismissing vigor and abandoning discernment—then the spirit will not decline, and though one may live for thousands or tens of thousands of years, one can deeply root and firmly establish oneself.\n\nIn the gardens and marshes of Zheng, many worthies abound; in the eastern quarter, many men of talent. During the labor at the gardens and marshes, there was a man named Bo Fengzi who, passing through the eastern quarter, encountered Deng Xi. Deng Xi turned to his disciples and laughed, saying: \"Let us perform a dance for him—what do you think of that one approaching?\" His disciples replied: \"We wish to know.\" Deng Xi said to Bo Fengzi: \"Do you understand the meaning of nurturing? To receive nurture from others yet be unable to nurture oneself is the way of dogs and swine. To nurture things so that they serve one’s use is the power of man. To make your disciples eat their fill, clothe themselves, and rest is the achievement of governance. Yet gathering the young and old like grass, treating them as livestock for the kitchen and pantry—how is this different from the way of dogs and swine?\" Bo Fengzi did not respond.\n\nOne of Bo Fengzi’s disciples then stepped forward out of turn and said: \"Has the master not heard of the many ingenious men in Qi and Lu? There are those skilled in earth and wood, those skilled in metal and leather, those skilled in music, those skilled in writing and calculation, those skilled in military affairs, and those skilled in ancestral rites—all talents are assembled. Yet none can determine rank, none can command others. Those who assign rank lack knowledge; those who command lack ability. Yet knowledge and ability are both employed by them. The one who governs is but one whom we employ—why should you boast?\" Deng Xi had no reply, so he glanced at his disciples and withdrew.\n\nA commentary states: The worthy conserves the spirit; the man of talent covets fame and position. Thus, the distance between worthiness and talent is vast indeed. Bo Fengzi’s worthiness and Deng Xi’s talent met upon the road: Deng Xi, coveting fame and position, danced before Bo Fengzi, while Bo Fengzi, conserving his spirit, resisted Deng Xi. His followers, unable to forget words, stepped out of turn to respond: \"Has the master not heard of the many ingenious men in Qi and Lu? Skilled in earth and wood, metal and leather, music, writing and calculation, military affairs, and ancestral rites—all are minor arts and those who serve. Those who assign rank lack knowledge; those who command lack ability. Those who lack knowledge and ability are emperors and kings. Those who possess knowledge and ability are ministers. Emperors and kings follow the Way of non-action; ministers hold the office of action. To serve the Way of non-action with the office of action—one who can square things cannot make them round, one who can make things white cannot make them black, one who can raise things high cannot bring them low, one who can make things dark cannot make them yellow. But to govern the office of action with the Way of non-action—then square and round, white and black, high and low, dark and yellow, none will be beyond mastery.\n\nThings each take shape according to their essence, yet this has no form. Things each acquire names according to their sound, yet this has no name. Thus, Deng Xi called the achievement of nurturing others so that things serve one’s use the work of governance, not knowing that the one who governs is but employed by others and cannot employ others. How can talent be relied upon? How can talent be a cause for pride?\"\n\nThus, when he heard the words of Bo Fengzi’s followers, though their arguments were sharp, he had no opening to interject—he merely eyed his disciples and withdrew.\n\nGongyibo was renowned among the feudal lords for his strength. Tangxigong spoke of him to King Xuan of Zhou, who prepared gifts and rites to summon him. When Gongyibo arrived and the king observed his appearance, he seemed but a feeble man. Perplexed, King Xuan asked, “What is the measure of your strength?” Gongyibo replied, “My strength can snap the leg of a spring katydid and crush the wing of an autumn cicada.” The king’s expression darkened as he said, “My own strength can rend the hide of rhinoceros and elephant, drag the tails of nine oxen, yet I still lament its weakness. You snap the leg of a spring katydid and crush the wing of an autumn cicada, yet your strength is famed throughout the world—how can this be?”\n\nGongyibo sighed deeply, withdrew from his mat, and said, “Excellent is Your Majesty’s question. I dare speak the truth. My master is one named Shangqiuzi, whose strength is unmatched in the world, yet even his kin do not know it, for he has never employed his strength.” The commentary states: Gongyibo was versed in the rites of public office, exemplifying the saying that “the good knight is not martial”—this is what it means to employ the strength of others. *Tang* signifies the high and level foundation, the vantage from which one oversees construction, the ground to which all look up in reverence. Tangxigong’s virtue was like a hall, able to embrace the feminine and become the world’s stream—this is how he recognized that Gongyibo did not rely on his own strength. King Xuan of Zhou was a sovereign of the middle revival, who would task men with affairs and test them by their achievements; thus, he sought those who were martial and mighty. Shangqiuzi embodied the constant virtue of the mean, holding fast to spirit in his nature—this is why, though his strength was such that even his kin did not know it, he became Gongyibo’s master.\n\nMoreover, to snap the leg of a spring katydid and crush the wing of an autumn cicada is strength not worth relying upon; thus, he did not use his own strength but sought to employ the strength of others—this is why his strength was immeasurable. To rend the hide of rhinoceros and elephant and drag the tails of nine oxen is strength sufficient to meet any foe; yet if one relies on such strength, it does not increase, and those who surpass one will arrive. Is this not feebleness in the strong and courage in the weak?\n\n“I pledged my life in service, and he instructed me, saying: ‘One who wishes to see what others cannot see must observe what others do not; one who wishes to obtain what others cannot obtain must practice what others will not. Thus, those who train their sight first perceive a cartload of firewood; those who train their hearing first hear the tolling of a bell. For one whose inner self is at ease, nothing is difficult without.’\n\n“Since nothing is difficult without, his name did not spread beyond his own household. Now my name is known among the feudal lords—this is my violation of my master’s teaching, my display of my own ability. Yet my name is not built upon relying on my strength but upon my ability to employ the strength of others. Is this not better than relying on one’s own strength?”\n\nThe commentary states: To pledge one’s life in service is to cast aside limbs and dull the senses—this may be called possessing the substance. Thus, he instructed him. What is meant by “seeing what others cannot see” and “obtaining what others cannot obtain” is not that one perceives the obscure and hidden alone, but that one achieves what is difficult and impossible for others to do. What one sees does not depart from what all see, yet none perceive it. What one does does not exceed what all can do, yet none do it. Thus, nothing is more difficult to see than an autumn hair, yet nothing is easier than a cartload of firewood; nothing is more difficult to hear than a gnat in flight, yet nothing is easier than the tolling of a bell. If one exhausts the power of the eyes on an autumn hair, one’s sight will not extend beyond it; if one strains the power of the ears on a gnat in flight, one’s hearing will not surpass it. But if one borrows the clarity of the multitude, the eyes need not strain, and one’s sight will have clarity to spare; if one borrows the hearing of others, the ears need not exhaust themselves, and one’s hearing will have acuity to spare.\n\nThe common people see things but not the Way, so they constantly assail what is difficult. The worthy see the Way but not things, so they always do what is easy. When what is easy lies within, nothing is difficult without—when nothing is difficult, nothing is not easy. Who, then, can bestow a name upon one? Thus, one’s name does not extend beyond the Way.\n\nTherefore, one who can employ the strength of others, though his strength could turn heaven and earth, the world does not witness his might; though his authority subdues the realm, none call him martial. The ancients had a saying: “One skilled in strength lifts an autumn hair; one skilled in hearing hears thunder”—this is what it means.\n\nMoreover, to snap the leg of a spring katydid and crush the wing of an autumn cicada, though it may be called making the weak strong, still leaves traces of what has been snapped and crushed—its deeds can be seen, its name can be spoken. Thus, Gongyibo still took this as a display of his ability, violating his master’s teaching.\n\nZhongshan Gongzi Mou was a worthy prince of the state of Wei. He delighted in associating with the worthy but neglected state affairs, taking pleasure in the company of Gongsun Long of Zhao. The followers of Le Zhengzi Yu laughed at him. Gongzi Mou said, “Why do you laugh at my delight in Gongsun Long?” Ziyu replied, “Gongsun Long’s character is such that he acts without a teacher, studies without companions, is glib but misses the mark, rambles without a school, loves the strange and speaks recklessly. He seeks to confuse men’s minds and silence their mouths, practicing sophistry with the likes of Han Tan.”\n\nGongzi Mou’s expression changed as he said, “Why do you describe Gongsun Long’s faults so? Pray tell me the truth.” Ziyu said, “I laugh at how he deceived Kong Chuan, saying that a skilled archer can make the rear arrowhead strike the front nock, each shot following the last, arrow after arrow, so that the front arrow reaches the target without a break, and the nock of the rear arrow still holds the bowstring—appearing as one. Kong Chuan was astonished. Gongsun Long said, ‘This is not yet the marvel.’ Among the disciples of Feng Meng was one named Hong Chao, who, enraged at his wife, sought to frighten her. He drew the Wuhao bow and the Qiwei arrows, aiming at her eye. The arrow flew straight to her pupil, yet her eyelid did not blink; the arrow fell to the ground, and no dust rose.”\n\n“Are these the words of a wise man?” Gongzi Mou said, “The words of the wise are inherently beyond the comprehension of fools. The rear arrowhead striking the front nock is merely the latter aligning with the former. The arrow flying straight to the pupil without the eyelid blinking—this is the full exertion of the arrow’s force. Why do you doubt it?”\n\nYue Zheng Ziyu said, “You are Gongsun Long’s disciple—how could you not gloss over his flaws? Let me speak of his greater absurdities. Long deceived the King of Wei, saying: ‘There is intention without mind, pointing without arrival, things not fully exhausted, shadows that do not move. A single hair can draw a thousand *jun*; a white horse is not a horse; an orphaned calf has never had a mother.’ His violations of categories and inversions of logic are beyond counting.”\n\nGongzi Mou said, “You take ultimate truths for absurdities—your error is the greater. Without intention, minds are the same; without pointing, all arrive; things fully known remain ever-present. Shadows that do not move are explained by transformation. A hair drawing a thousand *jun* is a matter of equal force. ‘A white horse is not a horse’ speaks to the separation of form and name. ‘An orphaned calf has never had a mother’—it is not an orphaned calf.”\n\nYue Zheng Ziyu said, “You take all of Gongsun Long’s clamor for reasoned argument. If he had spoken from some other orifice, you would still accept it.” Gongzi Mou fell silent for a long while, then took his leave, saying, “Let me return another day to discuss this with you further.”\n\n**Explanation:**\nGongsun Long was a sophist—yet Gongzi Mou took his words for ultimate truths. Ultimate truths transcend words; though one may speak all day, one has not truly spoken. Thus, though one may expound endlessly upon the ten thousand things, discoursing without cease, multiplying without end, this does not impair their being the ultimate in speech. To see Yue Zheng Ziyu’s words to Kong Chuan as deceit is to have never fully investigated principle; to see his words to the King of Wei as deception is to have never heard the Dao. Why is this so?\n\nA master archer can make the rear arrowhead strike the notch of the one before it, for he knows how to align the later with the earlier. When an arrow flies straight toward the pupil of the eye without the eyelid so much as fluttering, he has gauged the proper distance, assessed the strength of bow and arrow, and exhausted their potential without allowing the slightest excess or deficiency. All this can be deduced through reasoned principle.\n\nYet when words reside in the Dao, they leave form and abandon intellect, merging with the Great Thoroughfare. The intent is forgotten, the point negated. To exhaust the ten thousand things is ever to possess them, yet never to possess a single one—akin to the rod one foot in length, halved each day, never exhausted through ten thousand ages. The unmoving shadow: the former shadow is not the latter—akin to the arrow’s flight, so swift that there is a moment neither of motion nor of stillness. Equalize the potential of things, and a thousand jun are not heavy, a single hair not light. Depart from form and name, and whiteness cannot designate a horse, nor can \"horse\" name whiteness. A motherless calf has never had a mother. Calf and mother differ in bodily form and destiny, their principles not interchangeable. The subtlety of such words reaches this extreme—how could one who does not grasp the essence of language ever fathom their meaning?\n\nThus, before one has fully investigated principle, one laughs at them as deceit; yet when words reside in the Dao, one deems them perverse and contrary to reason. Though Gongzi Mou elucidated their meaning, Ziyu never awakened. Instead, he grew indignant, heaping scorn and reproach upon them. Gongzi Mou, knowing he could not speak of the ultimate Dao with him, fell silent and took his leave.\n\nYet Gongzi Mou had already come close to Ziyu’s level, still hoping that one day he might master himself and awaken. The ultimate words do not offend, yet he firmly rejected and utterly severed them. Hence he said, “Let me return another day to discuss this with you further.”\n\nGongsun Long’s disputations Gongzi Mou took for ultimate words; Liezi praised them, while Zhuangzi declared them capable of besting others in speech but not of winning their hearts. Liezi’s praise lauded their ultimacy. Zhuangzi, borrowing his arguments to dispel the traces of clinging to texts, at the end of his book both adopted his disputations and deplored those who, like him, made a spectacle of argument, lamenting their dissipation without attainment, their pursuit of the ten thousand things without return.\n\nTheir words differ, each appropriate in its own way. Yao governed the world for fifty years yet did not know whether the world was well governed or not, whether the countless masses wished to support him or not. He questioned his attendants—they did not know. He questioned the outer court—they did not know. He questioned those in the wilds—they did not know.\n\nEmperor Yao then donned humble attire and wandered the broad thoroughfares, where he heard children singing a folk song:\n\n*\"You set our teeming people aright,\nNone but you establish the norm.\nUnknowing, unperceiving,\nWe follow the Heavenly model’s form.\"*\n\nDelighted, Yao asked, \"Who taught you these words?\"\nThe children replied, \"We heard them from a minister.\"\nHe questioned the minister, who said, \"It is an ancient poem.\"\n\nYao returned to his palace, summoned Shun, and thereupon abdicated the realm to him. Shun did not decline but accepted.\n\n**Exegesis:**\nIn the age of the sage, there is no governance yet no disorder. Yao ruled the world for fifty years yet did not know whether it was well governed or not—this is precisely what is called *ultimate governance*. At that time, those at his side or in the outer court knew only to fulfill their duties faithfully; those in the wilds knew only their daily sustenance. Thus, from his attendants to the common folk, when questioned, none could say whether the realm was well governed or not. Yet Emperor Yao’s intent was to align Heaven with humanity, neither scorning the destitute nor abandoning the impoverished. He wished to know the truth, so he disguised himself and wandered the broad thoroughfares. In humble attire, he carried no outward authority to sway hearts; the thoroughfares were the crossroads of the nine provinces, where the sentiments of the four directions converged. The children’s song arose from natural joy, untainted by artifice. Its words—*\"You set our teeming people aright, / None but you establish the norm. / Unknowing, unperceiving, / We follow the Heavenly model’s form\"*—spoke of guiding the multitudes to a realm of ultimate principle, a Dao rooted in Heavenly virtue, far surpassing mere cleverness. The children had heard these words from a minister, who called it an ancient poem. That an ancient poem was now sung by children showed that present governance accorded with antiquity. Yao’s rule sought only to emulate the ancients—how could he not rejoice with his people upon hearing these words? This was the crowning achievement of Yao’s governance. The *Book of Documents* speaks of the people transforming into harmony—was this not that time?\n\nGuan Yinxi said:\n*\"Abiding nowhere within,\nYet all things take form through it.\nIn motion, it is like water;\nAt rest, like a mirror;\nIn response, like an echo.\"*\n\n**Exegesis:**\n*\"Abiding nowhere within\"* means leaving no speck of dust in the heart’s chamber. When utmost emptiness resides in me, the principles of the ten thousand things are nowhere concealed—hence *\"all things take form through it.\"* *\"In motion, it is like water\"* means it flows with change without constancy, yet its course is always fitting. *\"At rest, like a mirror\"* means it reflects things as they appear without grasping them. *\"In response, like an echo\"* means it answers every sound without anticipation or resistance. Thus, the Dao resembles things in this way. Things may stray from the Dao, but the Dao does not stray from things.\n\n**Exegesis:**\nThe Dao in things neither exceeds the great nor falls short of the small. Its vastness encompasses all boundaries; its subtlety penetrates the foulest depths. It apportions to things with perfect balance, neither lacking nor excess, stopping precisely where it should. Being like things in this way is why it is likened to a mirror and water. Thus, the Dao in the world is like the sun and moon illuminating all, their light reaching the four directions without obstruction—yet the blind do not see. Is the fault in the sun? Things stray from the Dao; the Dao does not stray from things. The proof lies here.\n\nThose who excel in the Dao neither employ the ears nor the eyes, neither strength nor the heart. To seek the Dao through seeing, hearing, form, or intellect is misguided. It may seem before you, then suddenly behind; in use, it fills the six directions; when set aside, its whereabouts are unknown. Neither those with intent can grasp it from afar, nor those without intent draw near. Only those who silently attain it and nurture it through their nature truly possess it.\n\n**Exegesis:**\nDevoid of sound or form, those who embody the Dao do not rely on ears or eyes. Without substance or function, they do not employ the heart or strength. Like following a trail, it may seem ahead, then suddenly behind. In use, one sees the Dao, not things—hence it fills the six directions. When set aside, one sees things, not the Dao—hence its whereabouts are unknown. How, then, does one excel in the Dao? Neither those with intent can grasp it from afar, for the Dao does not reside in non-action; nor can those without intent draw near, for the Dao is not exhausted by action. Only those who silently attain it and nurture it through their nature truly possess it. Silent attainment requires no words; nurturing through nature demands no action. Such possession is not the possession of others but the self’s own attainment. Only those who attain this neither drown in emptiness nor cling to existence. Within me, there is non-action yet nothing left undone; in things, there is non-use yet nothing unused.\n\nThose who know forget emotion; those who are capable do not act—this is true knowledge and true capability. If one acts without knowing, how can there be emotion? If one acts without capability, how can there be action?\n\n**Exegesis:**\nHumans are esteemed above the ten thousand things for their knowledge and ability. Yet they are enslaved by creation because they are ruled by knowledge and ability. What is prized in knowledge and ability is that the Dao cannot be drawn near by those without intent. What is detested in knowledge and ability is that the Dao cannot be grasped from afar by those with intent. Knowing yet forgetting emotion removes the chisel of cunning; one’s knowledge becomes natural, knowing all without exception—this is true knowledge. Capable yet not acting avoids the burden of action; one’s ability pervades all things without limit—this is true capability. Only with sincerity and trust can one embody the Dao. Acting without knowing is not forgetting emotion but being incapable of emotion—how can this be the Dao? Only those who can harmonize yin and yang embody the Dao.\n\nUnable to act—this is not \"non-action\" but true incapacity; how can this be the Dao? This is why the clumping of earth and the piling of dust are not the principle.\n\nConsider Shang Qiu Kai’s treading upon water and fire—this is knowing yet forgetting emotion. Consider Confucius’s abstention from playing metal and stone instruments—this is ability yet not acting. Clumped earth and piled dust, though non-active, are not the principle.\n\nExplanation: Clumped earth does not stir as the wild horses’ whirling gusts; piled dust does not rise as the flying motes—this may be called non-action. Yet though non-active, the generative principle is extinguished. What value, then, lies in non-action?\n\nThe Sage’s non-action is like the receptive Earth’s profound bearing: it fills the four voids, is without intent toward things, has never acted, yet the myriad things transform and grow, everlasting and unceasing—this is true non-action. From the Sovereign to the Emperors, from transmission to Confucius who perfected it, their Dao all originates here. Thus the chapter *\"Zhongni\"* concludes with this.\n\n**Zhongni’s Explanation**\nThe Dao of Confucius is like the great light rising in the east—none, whether foolish or wise, fail to know its brightness. Yet only by examining the words of sages and worthies can one plumb its subtleties.\n\nZi Gong said: \"In my view, the Master surpasses Yao and Shun by far.\"\nMencius said: \"Confucius is the one who perfected the great synthesis.\" And further: \"Since the birth of mankind, none has been greater than Confucius.\"\nYangzi said: \"Is not the Dao of Heaven embodied in Zhongni?\"\n\nZi Gong possessed wisdom sufficient to recognize the Sage. Mencius was a disciple of Confucius. Yangzi compared himself to Mencius. Their praise of the Sage is what the world and all generations take as their model.\n\nExamining the classics to seek the Master’s Dao: when office is possible, serve; when cessation is possible, cease; when duration is possible, endure; when haste is possible, hasten—without leaning toward any one side. When the times are pure, be pure; when the times call for service, serve; when the times are harmonious, be harmonious—without clinging to any one corner. Able to be benevolent and to extend it, able to be eloquent and to be reticent, able to be courageous and to be timid, able to be solemn and to be affable—unconfined by any single path.\n\nConfucius said: \"I differ from others in this: nothing is absolutely permissible or impermissible.\" Yet later scholars lean toward one side, cling to one corner, are confined to one path, and fail to perceive the Sage’s completeness—this is why the chapter *\"Zhongni\"* was composed.\n\nYanzi grasped only the joy of knowing Heaven’s decree and the absence of sorrow, yet did not know the great sorrow inherent in knowing Heaven’s decree. Yanzi, though next to a Sage, still required instruction to understand—how much more so Zi Gong and his peers, who exhausted their thoughts to the point of emaciation!\n\nGuan Yin said: \"Those who are good at the Dao do not rely on ears, do not rely on eyes, do not rely on strength, do not rely on the mind. Only by silently recognizing one’s nature and allowing it to mature can one attain it.\"\nMencius said: \"When office is possible, serve; when cessation is possible, cease; when duration is possible, endure; when haste is possible, hasten—this is what is meant by Confucius perfecting the great synthesis.\" These all understood Confucius.\n\nIn studying the meaning of this chapter, one sees the profoundest depths of Confucius.\n\nGeng Sangzi perceived what lay beyond the eight wilds yet lost both hearing and sight. Lie Yukou studied for nine years until his bones and flesh dissolved—who but those who exhaust the divine and fathom the subtlest could achieve this?\n\nThe Grand Steward of Shang was deeply perplexed by the Sage of the West and believed he had been deceived by Liezi. He did not visit Nan Guo’s wall yet trusted in its rival—how could those of shallow knowledge and limited learning in the world presume to discuss this?\n\nThe heart closed in one aperture, and Long Shu’s illness was difficult to cure. A single hair lifted a thousand jun, yet Yue Zheng’s doubt remained unresolved. Deng Xi mocked Bo Feng’s companions yet was ensnared by his followers. Emperor Yao heeded the poem of a child and gained the trust of his ministers. Gong Yi Bo’s strength could lift a cicada’s wing, yet his fame resounded among the feudal lords. Shang Qiuzi’s strength rivaled the world, yet his merit and use sank among the six clans. When Ji Liang died, Yang Zhu leaned against his gate and sang; when Sui Wu died, Yang Zhu caressed his corpse and wept.\n\nSuch cases—how could they be easily fathomed? All are called the deeds of Confucius, yet the common people surely do not understand.\n\nThose who study today, upon reading the *Zhuangzi* and reaching the chapters \"The Fisherman\" and \"Robber Zhi,\" cast them aside and reject them, believing they slander and disparage Confucius and thus refuse to examine them—how could they know that Zhuangzi revered Confucius above all?\n\nIn this very section, the *Liezi* elucidates before and after, making the teachings of Confucius radiant through the ages without end—such is the power of its exploration. Zai Wo said: \"In my view, the Master surpasses Yao and Shun by far.\" He also said: \"Since the birth of humankind, none have been as great as Confucius.\" Yet Confucius remained modest and concealed his brilliance; when the Grand Steward of Shang inquired whether he was a sage, he demurred and declined the title.\n\nAs for Guan Yin Xi’s words on the goodness of the Dao—true knowledge lies in the absence of emotion, true ability in non-action—this further illuminates the Way of Confucius. For Confucius’ engagement with the world, his navigation of change and misfortune, never strayed from the real. He neither forced his counsel like a peddler hawking remedies nor embraced inert inaction like a clod of earth or a heap of dust. He ever dwelled in true knowledge and true ability, residing between the useful and the useless.\n\nThus, this section begins by speaking of his true joy and true knowledge, and concludes by expounding his true knowledge and true ability.\n\n*Explication of the Perfect Dao of Primordial Emptiness, Volume Eight* concludes.\n*Explication of the Perfect Dao of Primordial Emptiness, Volume Nine* begins.\n\nMinister Jiang Yu, an Inner College Student of Hangzhou Prefecture, Song Dynasty, presents:\n\n*Tang’s Inquiry*\n\nTang of Yin asked Xia Ge: “Did things exist in the earliest antiquity?”\nXia Ge replied: “In the earliest antiquity, there were no things. How could there be things now? Would later generations be right to say that there are no things now?”\n*Explication*: Only after the existence of Heaven and Earth did the myriad things come to be. The myriad things fill the space between Heaven and Earth, and tracing their origin, they share a single qi. The movement of this qi is without end, and thus the generation of the myriad things continues without interruption. Through transformation and ceaseless flux, they change day by day and month by month. The names “now” and “ancient” are but provisional, and the presence or absence of things—how does it differ between now and ancient times?\n\nThat Tang, endowed with Heaven-bestowed wisdom, should pose this question to Xia Ge is because the transmission from the Three Sages—Yao, Shun, and Yu—reached Tang, and though the transition from Xia to Shang arose from adapting to the times, it was unprecedented in antiquity. To use what exists now to verify what did not exist in ancient times, and to trace it upward to the era of Fuxi, is to see the Dao gradually recede into simplicity and return to the primordial. Thus, the question of whether things had presence or absence in antiquity is the meaning of Tang’s inquiry to Xia Ge.\n\nTang of Yin said: “Then do things have no before or after?”\nXia Ge replied: “The beginning and end of things have no ultimate limit. What was a beginning may become an end, and what was an end may become a beginning. How can one know their order? Yet beyond things and before events, this is what I do not know.”\n*Explication*: Viewed through form, things disperse into myriad distinctions. The past does not recognize the present, nor the future the past. Even in the briefest breath of coming and going, one cannot disorder their sequence of before and after. Viewed through nature, things are one in their true essence. What was a beginning may become an end, and what was an end may become a beginning. Even the covering and bearing of Heaven and Earth do not know the before or after of things.\n\nExamining the transformations of things: the sparrow hawk becomes the goshawk, the goshawk becomes the cuckoo, and the cuckoo in time reverts to the sparrow hawk. The end of the sparrow hawk is the beginning of the goshawk; the end of the goshawk is the beginning of the cuckoo; and the end of the cuckoo is the beginning of the sparrow hawk again. This extends to the putrid transforming into the wondrous, and the wondrous reverting to the putrid. In their arising, none know whence they come; in their transformation, none know whither they go. It is like the coming and going of the sun and moon, the succession of the four seasons—does day precede night, or autumn precede spring? None can know their order. For all are confined within creation, equal within the turning wheel. How then can there be any distinction of before or after? To know what comes first, must one not look to that which is beyond things and events, and is undifferentiated and complete? Yet beyond things and before events, it is dark and obscure, silent and still—how could wisdom ever know it? Thus, he says, “This is what I do not know.”\n\nTang of Yin said: “Then do the eight directions above and below have limits?”\nGe replied: “I do not know.”\nTang pressed him further.\nGe said: “If there is nothing, then there is no limit; if there is something, then there is an end. How could I know this? Yet beyond the limitless there is no further limitlessness, and within the endless there is no further endlessness. Beyond the limitless there is no further limitlessness, and within the endless there is no further endlessness. Thus, I know it is limitless and endless, but I do not know that it has limits or ends.”\n*Explication*: If there is nothing, then there is no limit; if there is something, then there is an end. Knowing this, the limitlessness of the eight directions above and below becomes self-evident. Yet reckoning that Heaven and Earth exist within the Great Void, though they have not departed from things, they are the greatest of things. Though greatest, they are still things. Thus, their existence differs from the existence of other things. One cannot call them limited, for they are vast; nor can one call them endless, for they exist. To say they are difficult to exhaust or fathom—this is nearly correct. Thus, Xia Ge says: “Beyond the limitless there is no further limitlessness, and within the endless there is no further endlessness.” The limitless and endless—this is already the utmost. That within the limitless and endless there is no further limitlessness or endlessness is how one perceives the magnitude of Heaven and Earth. Yet this so-called “nothing” is not true nothingness, but rather the absence of form. To call it “nothing” is to dispel the notion of “something.” Since Heaven and Earth have not departed from existence, one borrows “nothing” to reveal their vastness. In the end, however, since they already exist, they will return to an end. Thus, the beginning and end are ultimately lodged in the unknown.\n\nTang further asked: “What exists beyond the four seas?”\nGe replied: “The same as the Central States.”\nTang said: “How do you verify this?”\nGe replied: “When I traveled east to Ying, the people were the same. Asking about what lay east of Ying, it was still like Ying. When I traveled west to Bin, the people were the same. Asking about what lay west of Bin, it was still like Bin. From this, I know that the four seas, the four wastes, and the four poles are no different.”\n*Explication*: The “uniformity of the four seas” refers to the Central States, where Heaven and Earth unite, the four seasons intersect, wind and rain gather, and yin and yang harmonize. Ying lies to the east of the sun, where shadows lengthen at dusk and winds are frequent; Bin lies to the west of the sun, where shadows lengthen at dawn and clouds are common. Though the land is remote and customs differ, the nature of the people is no different from that of the Central States. West of Bin and east of Ying, the land is even farther from the nourishing rains, yet the people are still no different from those of the Central States. Thus, beyond the four seas—though beyond the reach of footprints, boats, or carts—by inferring from one nature to another, why wait to see or hear before knowing? Thus, the great and small contain one another without end. That which contains the myriad things is like that which contains Heaven and Earth. Since it contains the myriad things, it is inexhaustible.\n\nThat which contains Heaven and Earth is thus without limit. How do I know that beyond Heaven and Earth there are not greater Heaven and Earth? This, too, is what I do not know.\n\n**Explanation:** Within a single body, a single hair is contained by the skin, the skin by the whole, and the hundred parts by the body. Though a single hair is minute, it possesses the wholeness of the body; though it serves the function of the whole, it does not discard the combined use of the hundred parts. As for things: the pygmy cicada dwells within a mosquito’s eyelash, while the leviathan Peng soars through Heaven and Earth. The pygmy cicada is not deficient compared to the Peng, nor does the Peng have excess over the pygmy cicada—great and small contain one another, and that is all.\n\nYet the measure of things is easily exhausted, so what they contain has limits. Heaven and Earth are supremely vast, and what they contain is inexhaustible. Heaven and Earth still have form, but the Dao that contains them is without limit. Moreover, in speaking of great and small containing one another, it is evident that the great can contain the small, but how can the small contain the great? It is said that Heaven and Earth contain the myriad things, which can be perceived in form, yet what contains them is the Dao. Speaking in terms of the Dao, even the tiniest mustard seed contains the subtlety of Heaven and Earth. Thus it is said: that which contains the myriad things is like that which contains Heaven and Earth.\n\nThe statement *\"How do I know that beyond Heaven and Earth there are not greater Heaven and Earth?\"* is meant to expand the learner’s vision and prevent confinement within fixed boundaries, urging the awakened to know the Dao for themselves. Yet in the end, it is left unresolved, hence: *\"This, too, is what I do not know.\"*\n\nHowever, Heaven and Earth are also things. Things have deficiencies, which is why in ancient times Nüwa refined the five-colored stones to mend their flaws.\n\n**Explanation:** Viewed through the principle of great and small containing one another, it is clear that Heaven and Earth are merely things. Being things, how could they be without formation or decay? This is why they have deficiencies that can be mended. The five colors are the essence of the Five Phases; stones are the firm and refined qi of earth. Refining the essential and refined qi of the Five Phases to harmonize the waxing and waning of yin and yang—this is what is meant by mending their flaws. At that time, the Dao of regulating and assisting was already manifest. She severed the legs of the giant turtle to establish the four pillars.\n\nThe explanation states: Heaven and Earth drift within the Great Void, floating and utterly minute—no more than a single thing borne upon the giant turtle’s back. Since they are deficient and mendable, this floating state first comes to rest and ceases movement. Thus the turtle’s legs could be severed, the Four Pillars established, and the positions of above and below, the eight directions, made immutable.\n\nLater, Gonggong contended with Zhuanxu for the throne. Enraged, he struck Mount Buzhou, breaking the Pillar of Heaven and severing the Cords of Earth. Hence Heaven tilted to the northwest, and the sun, moon, and stars moved there; Earth sank in the southeast, and the hundred rivers and floodwaters flowed there.\n\nThe explanation states: The Pillar of Heaven is what Heaven relies upon to stand centered and not lean; the Cords of Earth are what Earth depends upon to maintain its four bounds and not collapse. This is the Dao before it departed from primordial undifferentiation. When the Dao descended and unified, one sign foretold the birth of Heaven and Earth. Once Heaven and Earth took their places, humanity emerged between them. Amidst the naturalness of emptiness and non-being, false clarity arose, giving rise to sameness and difference. Once sameness and difference were established, love and aversion intertwined. With love and aversion arose, contention and strife took root, and the qi of anger and resentment prevailed, destroying the Dao’s all-pervading completeness.\n\nThis is why Gonggong contended with Zhuanxu for the throne and struck Mount Buzhou. When the Pillar of Heaven was broken and the Cords of Earth severed, Heaven and Earth split, and the intermingling of their two primal qi made generation and transformation manifest. Thus Heaven tilted to the northwest, and the sun, moon, and stars moved there; Earth sank in the southeast, and the hundred rivers and floodwaters flowed there.\n\nThe northwest is the direction to which the myriad things return to their root. As the sun, moon, and stars move to the northwest, the essence of utmost yin converges below and is offered above, enabling the myriad things to draw upon its qi to live. The southeast is the direction in which the myriad things spread and flourish. As Earth does not fill the southeast, the essence of utmost yang converges above and descends below, enabling the myriad things to draw upon its moisture to take form.\n\nThus Heaven possesses essence, Earth possesses form; Heaven has its eight guiding principles, Earth its five measures, and together they become the mother of the myriad things. In humans, the right ear and eye are not as keen as the left, and the left hand and foot are not as strong as the right. Among things, though their forms and bodies undergo ten thousand changes, none can transgress the proper course of their transformation.\n\nTang further asked: Do things have greatness and smallness? Do they have length and brevity? Do they have sameness and difference?\n\nGe said: To the east of the Bohai Sea, beyond countless millions of *li*, there lies a great abyss, a truly bottomless valley called the Returning Gully. The waters of the Eight Vastnesses and Nine Wildernesses, along with the celestial Milky Way’s currents, all pour into it—yet it neither swells nor diminishes.\n\nWithin it stand five mountains: the first is Daiyu, the second Yuanqiao, the third Fanghu, the fourth Yingzhou, and the fifth Penglai. Each mountain rises and winds for thirty thousand *li*, its flat summit spanning nine thousand *li*. The distance between their midpoints is seventy thousand *li*, yet they stand as neighbors.\n\nExplanation: Water is used as a metaphor for the Dao. The Dao, as a thing, is so vast it cannot be encompassed, so deep it cannot be fathomed—yet it is the source from which all good things arise. Thus the great abyss is truly a bottomless valley, called the Returning Gully. The great origin of the Dao is all-encompassing; though heaven and humanity pour into it, it never overflows. Therefore, the waters of the Eight Vastnesses and Nine Wildernesses, along with the celestial Milky Way’s currents, all flow into it—yet it neither swells nor diminishes.\n\nThe image of mountains dwelling within it does not depart from the great origin of the Dao, for they are the source of the myriad transformations and the abode of immortals and sages. *Yu* (Daiyu) pertains to the nature of wood; *qiao* (Yuanqiao) to the sharpness of fire; *fang* (Fanghu) to the substance of metal; *zhou* (Yingzhou) to the category of water; and Penglai to the principle of earth. The names of these mountains—some denoting affairs, some resembling things—do not share a single meaning, yet none depart from the principles of the Five Phases.\n\nThe number ten thousand signifies fullness, symbolizing the completeness of the Dao. All numbers begin with one, are established by three, completed by five, flourish at seven, and reside at nine. One, three, five, seven, and nine are all yang numbers, the path of transformation. Thus, the numbers in this passage are used as metaphors for the Dao.\n\nUpon these mountains, their terraces and pavilions are all of gold and jade; their birds and beasts are pure white. Trees of pearl and coral grow in clusters, their blossoms and fruits all imbued with flavor. Those who eat of them never age or die. The inhabitants are all of the lineage of immortals and sages; day and night, those who fly back and forth among them are beyond counting.\n\nExplanation: The immortals and sages, their true essence undisturbed, thus manifest transformations: their terraces and pavilions are all of gold and jade, their birds and beasts pure white, their trees of pearl and coral clustered together, their blossoms and fruits likewise. Moreover, their blossoms and fruits transform naturally, neither splitting their husks in spring nor ripening in autumn. Thus, those who eat of them do not follow decay in its changes, nor do they grow old and die with transformation’s passing.\n\nThe bodies of immortals and sages are utterly empty and unburdened, so they constantly fly back and forth. From this, we may observe: hills and brambles, perils and evils—these are not uniform. How do we know they are not self-created by the human heart?\n\nYet the roots of the five mountains have no fixed attachment, forever rising and falling with the tides, never resting even for a moment. The immortals and sages, distressed by this, appealed to the Emperor. Fearing the mountains would drift to the western extreme and lose the dwelling of the assembled sages, the Emperor commanded Yuqiang to dispatch fifteen giant turtles to lift their heads and bear the mountains. They took turns in three shifts, exchanging every sixty thousand years. Only then did the five mountains stand firm and unmoving.\n\nA commentary states: Since the inability to stand firm even for a moment was deemed intolerable, while steadfast immobility was deemed secure, they necessarily relied upon humans and resorted to creatures to attain that stability. This is why the immortals and sages appealed to the Emperor, and why the Emperor commanded Yuqiang to act. Yuqiang is a divine spirit of the northern realm. Turtles serve as his envoys, thus Yuqiang dispatched the giant turtles to lift their heads and bear the mountains. Yet even these giant turtles, though mighty, possess limited strength, and their exertion must eventually falter. Therefore, their forces had to be combined, taking turns in three shifts, before they could sustain the weight.\n\nOnce a thing has been employed and relied upon for stability, that very thing must harbor what may harm it—and in turn, it may become harmful to us. Thus, alongside such turtles, there arose the kingdom of Longbo, whose people could hook six turtles with a single cast, hoist them upon their backs, and return home to sear their bones for divination. In the land of Longbo dwelt giants who, in fewer than a few strides, could reach the five mountains. With one cast, they hooked six turtles, bundled them together, hastened back to their kingdom, and seared their bones for divination. Thereupon, the two mountains Daiyu and Yuanqiao drifted to the northern pole and sank into the great sea, displacing countless immortals and sages. The Emperor, enraged, diminished the kingdom of Longbo to straiten its borders and shrank its people to shorten their stature. By the time of Fuxi and Shennong, the people of that land still measured several dozen *zhang* in height.\n\nA commentary states: Daiyu and Yuanqiao are mountains of the southeast. The earth does not fill the southeast, so these two mountains drifted and sank. Having sunk into the great sea at the northern pole, they returned to their primordial origin and reverted to the heart of the supreme Dao. Thus, the immortals and sages lost their dwelling and were scattered. Later ages saw manifest governance, which is why the Emperor’s wrath flared and the great principles of the ancients became obscured.\n\nFour hundred thousand *li* east of the Central States lies the kingdom of Jiao Yao, whose people stand but a foot and a half tall. Farther northeast dwell the Zhenren, who measure nine inches. South of Jing lies the realm of Mingling, where five hundred years make a spring and five hundred years an autumn. In high antiquity grew the Great Chun, for which eight thousand years make a spring and eight thousand years an autumn. Upon rotting soil sprout fungi and mushrooms that live from dawn to dusk. In the months of spring and summer appear midges, born with the rain and perishing at the sight of the sun.\n\nNorth of the northernmost lands lies the Dark Sea, a celestial lake. There dwells a fish spanning thousands of *li* in breadth, its length commensurate, called the Kun. There also dwells a bird called the Peng, whose wings resemble clouds trailing from the sky, its body proportionate. Who in the world knows of such creatures? Great Yu encountered them in his travels, Boyi recognized and named them, and Yijian recorded them in his annals.\n\nAlong the riverbanks between the Yangtze and the sea breed tiny insects called Jiaoming. They swarm and alight upon the eyelashes of mosquitoes without touching them. They come and go, roosting and departing, yet the mosquito remains unaware. Li Zhu and Zi Yu, though they rubbed their eyes and raised their brows to peer by day, could not discern their form. Jiao Hu and Yu, Shi Kuang, though they cupped their ears and bent their heads to listen by night, could not catch their sound. Only the Yellow Emperor and Rongchengzi, dwelling upon Kongtong, fasted together for three months, stilling their hearts and abandoning their forms, then slowly perceived with their spirit and beheld them as clearly as the slopes of Mount Song; slowly they listened with their *qi* and heard them as resoundingly as thunder.\n\nIn the lands of Wu and Chu stands a great tree called the You. Its leaves are jade-green and sprout in winter; its fruit is cinnabar-red and tastes sour. Consuming its bark and sap cures the ailment of *fenjue*. The Central States prize it, yet when carried north across the Huai River, it transforms into the trifoliate orange. The stork does not cross the Ji River; the raccoon dog dies if it crosses the Wen River—such is the nature of earthly *qi*.\n\nNevertheless, though forms and *qi* differ, their natures are the same, and none can alter another. All life attains wholeness, and all portions are sufficient. How then do I discern their vastness or smallness, their length or brevity, their sameness or difference?\n\nA commentary states: The myriad things fill the space between heaven and earth. They arise in different regions, transform at different times, and vary in their changes and measures. From the animate to the still, from the flying to the hidden, their shapes and forms are boundless. Can they ever be fully fathomed? Tracing them to their source, the workings of creation upon the ten thousand things all stem from spontaneity. And how can the ten thousand things choose their lot within creation? Whether they become an insect’s limb or a rat’s liver, they abide where they are placed.\n\nAs humans, born in the kingdom of Longbo, they cannot but be tall; as Jiao Yao or Zhenren, they cannot but be small. Among plants, as Mingling or Great Chun in Jing, they live long; as fungi upon rotting soil, they die young. Among animals, as Kun and Peng in the far north, they grow vast; as tiny insects along the riverbanks, they remain minute. The great do not exceed their nature by virtue of their size, nor do the small fall short of their nature by virtue of their smallness. Though long-lived, they must still perish, unable to add what their nature lacks; though short-lived, they still live, unable to diminish what their nature possesses. The trifoliate orange does not cross the Huai, the stork does not cross the Ji, the raccoon dog does not cross the Wen—all are constrained by earthly *qi*, yet their natures remain unalterable.\n\nThe chapter \"Free and Easy Wandering\" in the *Zhuangzi* elucidates this principle. I have often pondered: among creatures, none are greater than the giant turtles. Observe how they lift their heads to bear the mountains Daiyu and Yuanqiao—truly wondrous! Yet they cannot escape the fate of having their bones seared, so what advantage does their greatness confer? Among creatures, none are more minute than the Jiaoming. Though Li Zhu, Zi Yu, Jiao Hu, Yu, and Shi Kuang could neither see nor hear them, when the Yellow Emperor and Rongchengzi perceived them with spirit and listened with *qi*, they revealed an immeasurable vastness. Thus, what harm lies in smallness?\n\nThus, the vastness or minuteness, length or brevity, sameness or difference of things are not worth noting.\n\nThe Twin Mountains of Taihang and Wangwu spanned seven hundred *li* in breadth and rose ten thousand *ren* in height, originally situated south of Jizhou and north of Heyang. The Foolish Old Man of North Mountain, nearly ninety years of age, dwelled facing the mountains. Vexed by the northern barrier of the mountains and the circuitous paths for ingress and egress, he gathered his household to deliberate, saying: \"Shall we join forces to level the perilous heights, opening a passage south to Yu and reaching the southern bank of the Han River—would this be feasible?\" They assented in unison.\n\nHis wife raised a doubt: \"With your strength, you cannot even diminish the mound of Kuifu. How then can you contend with Taihang and Wangwu? Moreover, where will you dispose of the earth and stones?\"\n\nThe assembly replied: \"We shall cast them into the far reaches of the Bohai Sea, north of Yintu.\"\n\nThereupon, he led his children and grandchildren—three men capable of bearing the yoke—striking rocks and tilling the soil, transporting the debris in baskets to the edge of the Bohai Sea. The widowed wife of their neighbor, Jingcheng, had an orphaned boy who, though only just shedding his milk teeth, leapt forth to aid them. From winter’s chill to summer’s heat, they made but one return journey home.\n\nThe Wise Old Man of the River Bend laughed and sought to dissuade them, saying: \"How extreme is your folly! With the dregs of your years and remaining strength, you cannot even strip a single hair from the mountain—what then can you do with its earth and stones?\"\n\nThe Foolish Old Man of North Mountain sighed deeply and replied: \"Your heart is so obstinate, so utterly impervious—you are not even the equal of the widow and her frail child. Though I may die, I shall leave behind a son. My son will beget a grandson, and my grandson will beget a son...\"\n\nChild begets child, and child begets grandchild;\ndescendants stretch on without end.\nYet the mountain never grows—\nhow then shall it not be leveled?\n\nThe Wise Old Man of the River Bend had no reply.\n\nThe Spirit Who Grasps the Serpent, hearing of this, feared their unceasing resolve and reported it to the Emperor. Moved by their sincerity, the Emperor commanded the two sons of Kuafu to bear the two mountains away—one placed east of Shuō, the other south of Yōng. From that time on, south of Jì and north of the Hàn River, no ridges blocked the way.\n\nExplanation:\nAt the edge of the Bohai Sea, north of Yǐn’s lands, there was indeed space enough to hold the heights of Tàixíng and Wángwū. With descendants unending and the mountain never growing, to level the perilous heights, open the road south of Yù, and reach the northern bank of the Hàn—this principle too is credible. Having both the principle and perfect sincerity, even the Spirit Who Grasps the Serpent, bravest of beings, heard and knew fear. The Emperor’s loftiness likewise was moved by their sincerity. Thus, though the Foolish Old Man and his frail child were weak, they could clear the ridges south of Jì and north of the Hàn. Moreover, it was precisely because they were the Foolish Old Man and his frail child that these ridges were removed: the old man’s thoughts were gentle and his sincerity absolute, while the child’s will was single-minded, his qi soft and unadulterated—this is how they moved heaven and earth, stirred gods and spirits.\n\nHad they harbored inner doubts in the prime of their strength, they would have calculated their power insufficient to level even Kuífù’s mound and abandoned the task—this is why the old man’s wife voiced her doubts, and why the Wise Old Man of the River Bend laughed and sought to stop them.\n\nIn life, our vain calculations, the growth of the self, and the slow decay of the body—how are these barriers to the Dao any less than two mountains blocking the way? If one could likewise forget cunning and lay aside pride in one’s vitality, persist in sincerity without reckoning life or death, then in a single breath one might suddenly dissolve all obstructions and merge with the Dao. If not, it is only because sincerity has not yet reached its fullness.\n\nKuāfù, undaunted by his strength, sought to chase the sun’s shadow, pursuing it to the edge of Yú Valley. Parched with thirst, he rushed to drink from the Yellow River and the Wèi. When these proved insufficient, he turned north to drink from the Great Marsh, but before he reached it, he died of thirst on the way. He cast aside his staff, and where his flesh and fat soaked the earth, the Dèng Forest grew, spreading for thousands of miles.\n\n**Exposition:**\n\nWhat, after all, is the sun’s shadow? To pursue it without measuring one’s strength is to be enslaved by delusion. From delusion arises craving; with craving lodged within, even draining the Yellow River and the Wèi cannot quench the scorching heat of thirst—thus he perished on the road. Only after his death did he cast aside his staff. Where his flesh and fat soaked the earth, the Dèng Forest sprang forth, spreading for thousands of miles. Yet the moisture from a single body, seeping into the abandoned staff, could nourish a forest of thousands of miles, while it could not moisten his own parched bones—such is the ruin wrought by delusion.\n\n*Explication of the* **Perfect Virtue of the Primal Void***, Scroll Nine—Concluded*\n*Explication of the* **Perfect Virtue of the Primal Void***, Scroll Ten*\n*Presented by your subject Jiang Yu, an Inner Student of the Hangzhou Prefectural Academy*\n\n---\n\n**Yǔ’s Inquiry**\n\nThe Great Yǔ said: “Within the Six Directions and the Four Seas, all is illumined by sun and moon, ordered by the stars, regulated by the four seasons, and governed by the Great Year. The beings born of the numinous take myriad forms—some die young, some live long—only the sage can fathom their Way.”\n\nXià Gé replied: “Yet there are those who arise without relying on the numinous, take form without depending on yin and yang, shine without awaiting sun and moon, perish without violence, live long without cultivation, eat without the five grains, clothe themselves without silk or floss, and move without boats or chariots. Their Way is spontaneous, beyond even the sage’s comprehension.”\n\n**Exposition:**\n\nWhen it is said that only the sage can fathom their Way, this does not mean the sage delights in comprehending things—rather, the Way is such that nothing lies beyond it. As for that which the sage cannot comprehend, it is not that the sage is incapable, but that the Way is naturally so, requiring no act of comprehension. Yet it is only because there exists that which the sage cannot comprehend that there arises what the sage *can* comprehend.\n\nWhen Yǔ governed the waters and lands, he lost his way and strayed into a foreign realm. North of the Northern Sea, beyond countless thousands of miles from Qí Province, lay a land called Zhōngběi. Its borders were unbounded, untouched by wind, rain, frost, or dew. No birds, beasts, insects, fish, grasses, or trees grew there. All was level, encircled by towering ridges.\n\n**Exposition:**\n\nThe north is the direction of darkness, where the myriad things withdraw, where the True One converges, and where the utmost spirit dwells. North of the Northern Sea lies the land of Zhōngběi—refined beyond refinement, numinous beyond the numinous. Unconfined by direction, it has no fixed borders. Unenslaved by qi, it knows no transformations of yin and yang. Independent of things, it produces no creatures, plant or animal. All is level—its Way utterly even. Encircling ridges leave no gaps beyond. How could even the divine Yǔ have reached such a land? Even he, had he not lost his way, could never have arrived, for it lies beyond the reach of foot, strength, boat, or chariot.\n\nAt the land’s center stood a mountain named Húlǐng, shaped like a carrying-pole with jars suspended at either end. At its summit was an opening like a ring, called the *Zī* Cavern. A spring gushed forth, named the *Shénfèn*, its fragrance surpassing orchid and pepper, its taste exceeding fine wine. From a single source, it divided into four channels, flowing down the mountain to irrigate the entire land. The soil’s qi was harmonious, and no plagues arose. The people’s nature was gentle, yielding to things without contention. Their hearts were soft, their bones weak—neither proud nor envious. Young and old dwelled together without rulers or subjects. Men and women wandered freely, without matchmakers or betrothals. They lived along the waters, neither plowing nor sowing. The soil’s warmth was just right, so they neither wove nor wore clothes. They lived a hundred years, neither dying young nor falling ill. Their population flourished without count, ever joyful, untouched by sorrow, aging, or suffering. Fond of song, they clasped hands and sang in turns, their voices never ceasing. When hungry or weary, they drank the *Shénfèn*, and their strength and spirits became peaceful. If they overindulged, they grew drunk, waking only after ten days. Bathing in the *Shénfèn*, their skin became sleek and glossy, their fragrance lingering for ten days.\n\n**Exposition:**\n\nAt the center, above, hollow yet unobstructed, its flow endless, its outflow inexhaustible—such is the *Shénfèn* of the *Zī* Cavern, ever nourishing the myriad things. Its fragrance surpasses orchid and pepper, its taste exceeds fine wine—so its Way spreads, its scent delighting the heart. Irrigating the entire land, it is present in all things without exception. The absence of plagues shows its perfect harmony undispersed. The people’s gentle nature arises from the pure qi held within. Soft hearts mean the spirit is concentrated; weak bones mean the form is released. Young and old dwelling together, men and women mingling freely—such people know no marriage or officialdom. Neither plowing nor sowing, neither weaving nor wearing clothes—such people need no garments or food. Living a hundred years, they meet their end in due course. Their population flourishes, their life endless. Clasping hands and singing in turns, each attains true joy. Their ability to live thus stems from drinking the *Shénfèn* to transform their inner selves and bathing in it to permeate their outer forms.\n\nWhen King Mù of Zhōu journeyed north and passed through this land, he forgot to return for three years. Upon his return to the Zhōu court, he longed for the land, lost in melancholy. He refused wine and meat, summoned no concubines, and only after months did he recover.\n\nGuǎn Zhòng urged Duke Huán of Qí to journey through Liáokǒu, intending to reach this land and nearly succeeding. Xí Péng remonstrated: “My lord, you abandon the vastness of Qí, its teeming people, its scenic mountains and rivers, its abundant resources, its flourishing rites and music, its splendid robes, its palace filled with beauties, its court brimming with loyal ministers. With a shout, a million soldiers rise; with a gesture, the feudal lords obey. Why envy that land and forsake Qí’s altars of soil and grain to follow the ways of barbarians?”\n\nDuke Huán, taking Xí Péng’s words to heart, desisted, and relayed them to Guǎn Zhòng. Guǎn Zhòng replied: “This is truly beyond Péng’s comprehension. I fear that land is beyond all knowing. Why cling to Qí’s wealth? Why heed Péng’s words?”\n\nThe explanation follows: King Mù of Zhōu once roamed as a spirit with a *huà-rén*, hence his later unrestrained wanderings, during which he passed through that land. For three years he forgot to return—such is the reception of those who are spiritually attuned. Yet upon his return, after mere months, he resumed wine and meat, summoned his concubines, and sought what was no longer of the spirit. From the sage-king Yǔ to King Mù’s time, governance shifted through the phases of loyalty, substance, and refinement, yet Mù’s journey and Yǔ’s arrival in that land revealed no difference in what they witnessed. Is this not proof that the workings of the spirit alone endure and remain whole?\n\nHow could the hegemony of Duke Huán or the worthiness of Xí Péng fathom this? Their narrow view of Qí’s proximity, believing nothing surpasses it, leads them to dismiss me as senile—like a frog in a shallow well, exulting in its pit’s joys, unaware of the Eastern Sea’s vast delight.\n\nIn the southern lands, people wear their hair loose and go bare; in the north, they wrap their heads and don furs; in the Central States, they wear caps and robes. Across the nine regions, livelihoods vary—some farm, some trade, some hunt, some fish—like winter furs and summer linen, boats for water and carts for land. These are acquired, shaped by nature, and made one’s own.\n\nEast of Yuè lies the land of Zhéxiū, where the eldest son, at birth, is sliced and eaten, deemed “fitting for younger brothers.” When a grandfather dies, they carry the grandmother away and abandon her, saying, “A ghost-wife cannot share a dwelling.” South of Chǔ lies the land of the Yán people, where upon a relative’s death, the flesh is left to rot before the bones are buried—only then is one called a filial son. West of Qín lies the land of Yíqú, where the dead are piled with wood and burned. The rising smoke is called “ascending afar,” and only then is one deemed filial. Such practices are upheld as governance above and custom below, yet they are not deemed strange.\n\nThe explanation follows: Where the five administrations extend and the seven tributes sustain, where heaven and earth converge, lies the Central States—hence its people wear caps and robes. Farmers, merchants, hunters, and fishers; winter furs and summer linen; boats and carts—all their deeds align with the central Way. Yet where the land leans toward yin or yang, so too do its customs. Thus, the southern lands, scorched by heat, favor loose hair and bare skin, while the northern lands, gripped by cold, wrap their heads and wear furs. In the farthest reaches of the four seas, the four wastes, the four poles, there exist lands like Zhémù, Yán, and Yíqú, where customs defy what eyes and ears know, startling human reason. Upheld as governance and embraced as custom, lived without doubt—all shaped by yin and yang. How deeply habit and custom can confound!\n\nConfucius, traveling east, saw two children arguing and asked the reason. One child said: “I believe the sun is nearer at dawn and farther at noon.” The other insisted the sun was farther at dawn and nearer at noon. The first child argued: “At dawn, the sun is as large as a carriage canopy, but by noon it is like a plate—does this not prove that what is far appears small, and what is near appears large?” The second child countered: “At dawn, the sun is cool and refreshing, but by noon it is scalding like boiling water—does this not prove that what is near is hot, and what is far is cool?” Confucius could not decide. The children laughed: “Who says you are so wise?”\n\nThe explanation follows: The sun clings to the heavens and revolves with them. Above and below, in all eight directions, boundless and endless, impossible to exhaust—how can its distance be measured in an instant? The *Yuánmìng Bāo* states: “Heaven is incomplete in the northwest; yang culminates at nine, hence heaven’s circuit spans nine times nine, eighty-one myriad *lǐ*.” The *Lì Jì* says: “Numbers begin at one, stand at three, complete at five, flourish at seven, and rest at nine—thus heaven is nine myriad *lǐ* from earth.” Both schools inherit this teaching. If one accepts their claims, does it not align with the idea that what is near is hot and what is far is cool? Yet when tested against the carriage-canopy and plate analogy, it does not hold.\n\nThus, when the sun emerges from Fú Sāng as morning light, it is cool and refreshing, likened to a carriage canopy. When it faces Kūn Wú at high noon, it is like boiling water, likened to a plate. What should be large appears small; what should be cool feels warm; what should be near seems far. Though the children’s wisdom was slight, even they were confounded by these contradictions. To fathom the reason, even Confucius’s wisdom could not resolve it.\n\nFor the sun is like the Dao: deem it distant, and one may grasp it in a breath; deem it near, and one may remain lost for a lifetime. Speak of its vastness, and its use fills the void; speak of its smallness, and its absence goes unnoticed. Thus, to judge the sun by size is the mark of ignorance; to seek the Dao in refinement or coarseness is to not know the Dao.\n\nConsider this: if one seeks fire from the sun using a fire-drill, it arrives in an instant—where then is the distinction between dawn and noon, near and far? Yet size and distance remain unfathomable—this is the sun’s mystery, its ceaseless motion through the ages.\n\nWas Confucius truly unable to decide? He left it unexamined. The children hastily declared Confucius unwise, yet Confucius himself said: *“Do I possess knowledge? I possess no knowledge.”* If Confucius were truly wise, why would he be Confucius?\n\nThe petty squabbling over the sun’s size and distance is but childish bickering. *Equality*—this is the supreme principle of the world.\n\n**Explanation:** To equalize the myriad things, allowing no distinction of high or low, is to merge self and other into oneness. In oneness, one aligns with the Dao—this is the supreme principle of the world. Hence, Zhuangzi’s *\"On the Equality of Things.\"*\n\nThe same holds for physical objects. When a hair is evenly suspended, it may bear weight until it snaps—but if truly balanced, it will never break. Some dismiss this, yet there are those who understand its truth.\n\n**Explanation:** In physical matters, the few cannot overcome the many, nor can the weak subdue the strong—this much is certain. Yet if one grasps the principle of *equality* and applies it, even the faintest hair can draw a thousand *jun* without snapping. Those who deny this are shackled by things; those who recognize it have penetrated the principle. Physical connections are but trifles—if one attains *equality*, the small can thus control the great. How much more so when one achieves the great *equality* of the supreme principle? What then could not be accomplished?\n\nZhan He once used a single silkworm’s thread for a line, a needle’s barb for a hook, a stalk of *jing* bamboo for a rod, and a grain of rice for bait—yet he drew fish as large as a cart from an abyss a hundred *ren* deep, amidst rushing currents, without the line breaking, the hook bending, or the rod warping. The King of Chu, hearing of this, summoned him in astonishment and asked the reason.\n\nZhan He replied: \"I once heard my late master speak of Pu Juezi’s archery. With a weak bow and slender cord, he rode the wind and struck, bringing down two cormorants in the azure sky. His mind was focused, his hand in perfect balance. I took this as my model and practiced angling, spending five years mastering its way. When I stand by the river with rod in hand, my mind is free of distractions, fixed only on the fish. Casting the line and sinking the hook, my hand makes no distinction of light or heavy—nothing can disturb it. The fish see my hook and bait as mere drifting dust or foam, swallowing without hesitation. Thus, I can use the weak to control the strong, the light to draw the heavy.\"\n\n\"If Your Majesty governs the state with such skill, the world could be held in the palm of your hand—what further effort would be needed?\"\n\nThe King of Chu said: \"Well said.\"\n\n**Explanation:** Using the weak to control the strong, the weak must break; using the light to draw the heavy, the light must be crushed. Why? Because their power is unequal. Yet if I, though weak, leverage the other’s strength to control it, that strength will not oppose me but serve me—thus, strength lies with me, and weakness with the other. Though I am light, if I harness the other’s weight to govern it, that weight will not contend with me but obey me—thus, weight lies with me, and lightness with the other. Then who can say the weak cannot control the strong, or the light draw the heavy? This is the principle by which Zhan He, with silk thread and needle-hook, drew cart-sized fish from an abyss a thousand *ren* deep, and Pu Juezi, with a weak bow and slender cord, brought down two cormorants in the azure sky.\n\nAh! Angling and archery are different arts, yet governance is not so distinct. Zhan He learned angling from Pu Juezi’s archery, then used it to instruct the King of Chu in statecraft. For one who attains the supreme principle of *equality*, though things may shift endlessly, how could they escape this principle? This is what Zhuangzi meant by *\"Unify all things, and ten thousand affairs are complete.\"* Thus, the sage, with a body as insignificant as dust, governs the world as if holding it in one hand—how could this apply only to the state of Chu?\n\nGonghu of Lu and Qi Ying of Zhao both fell ill and together sought Bian Que’s treatment. Bian Que cured them...\n\nOnce their illnesses were cured together, Bian Que said to Gonghu and Qi Ying: \"The ailments you suffered before were external invasions of your organs, which medicine and stone could remedy. Now, however, you bear congenital afflictions that have grown with your bodies. If I were to treat these for you, how would that be?\" The two replied, \"We would first like to hear the evidence.\"\n\nBian Que said to Gonghu: \"Your will is strong but your *qi* is weak, so you excel in planning yet falter in decisiveness.\" To Qi Ying he said: \"Your will is weak but your *qi* is strong, so you lack forethought and err in inflexibility. If I were to exchange your hearts, both would attain balance in virtue.\"\n\nThereupon, Bian Que gave them a poisoned wine to drink, rendering them unconscious for three days. He then opened their chests, extracted their hearts, exchanged them, and restored them. Applying a divine medicine, they awoke as before.\n\nHe explained: \"Deliberation resides in the will, while decisiveness belongs to *qi*. The will commands *qi*—when the will is sufficient to lead *qi*, its expression is always measured. When the will is insufficient to command *qi*, it becomes enslaved to *qi* and disturbs the heart. Thus, excessive *qi* leads to inflexibility, while weak *qi* results in indecision.\n\nI have often said that the will lies within oneself, untouched by transformation. Yet by clinging to the notion of a fixed self, one cherishes life and clings to the body. In cherishing the body, one becomes its servant. This is why Gonghu and Qi Ying’s will and thought were governed by the strength or weakness of their *qi* and physical form. That one’s will and thought should be enslaved to *qi* and body—truly, this is lamentable. Yet Bian Que could cure their ailments and alter the workings of creation—how wondrous is this!\n\nNow, *Gonghu* suggests domineering arrogance, hence Gonghu’s strong will and aptitude for planning. *Ying* evokes infancy, hence Qi Ying’s weak will and lack of foresight. The two then took their leave and returned home.\n\nThereupon, Gonghu went to Qi Ying’s house and claimed his wife and children, but they did not recognize him. Likewise, Qi Ying went to Gonghu’s house and claimed his wife and children, but they, too, did not recognize him. The two households thus brought suit against each other, seeking Bian Que’s judgment to resolve the dispute. Bian Que explained the cause, and the dispute was settled.\n\nHe expounded: \"Once, when Confucius traveled to Chu, he saw piglets nursing from their dead mother. After a moment, they glanced at one another, abandoned her, and fled. They did not see their mother as herself, nor did they find her like themselves. Thus, if something is not of one’s kind, even piglets will abandon their mother. But if it is of one’s kind, then even if Gonghu and Qi Ying returned to the wrong houses, their families would not doubt them.\n\nNow, after Bian Que exchanged their hearts, only their forms remained enslaved to their original selves. Each returned to the other’s house yet did not recognize that their form was no longer their own. The two households, deceived by the change in appearance, failed to perceive that the two men were now of the other’s kind. Thus, they did not recognize them.\n\nBut tell me: in judging these two men, did the households seek them within their physical forms? Or did they seek them beyond their physical forms? If beyond, then why did they so readily accept Bian Que’s judgment? If within, then when they returned to their houses, how could they not recognize them? Why would they need Bian Que’s intervention?\n\nAlas! From birth to death, the great transformations shift ceaselessly. From old age to infancy, how vastly do appearance, countenance, wisdom, and demeanor differ—far more than the exchange of Gonghu and Qi Ying’s forms! Yet the flow of great transformation is so subtle that people traverse it unawares. Bian Que’s exchange of their hearts was abrupt, so none could fail to be astonished by the change.\n\nMoreover, when Gonghu and Qi Ying’s will and *qi* were exchanged, neither they nor their households could recognize one another. How much more so with the workings of creation upon the ten thousand things—born through transformation, dying through transformation, dying and being reborn without end, with no one knowing its origin! How could people possibly comprehend its reasons?\n\nOnce, when Yang Zhu set out, he wore plain white robes; upon returning, he wore black. His dog, not recognizing him, barked at him. This is why Yang Zhu stopped Yang Bu from beating his dog.\n\nWhen Hu Ba played the zither, birds danced and fish leapt. Hearing this, Zheng Shiwen abandoned his home to study under Master Xiang. For three years, his fingers pressed the strings and hooked the pegs, yet he could not produce a single melody. Master Xiang said, 'You may return home now.'\n\nShiwen set down his zither and sighed: 'It is not that I cannot hook the strings or form melodies. What I seek does not lie in the strings, nor does my aspiration reside in sound. If my heart does not attain it within, and my instrument does not respond without, how dare I lift my hands to move the strings?' He asked for a little more time to observe what would follow.\n\nBefore long, he returned to Master Xiang. 'How is your zither playing now?' Master Xiang asked. Shiwen replied, 'I have attained it. Please, allow me to demonstrate.'\"\n\nThus, when spring arrived, he struck the *shang* string to summon *Nanlü*, and a cool breeze suddenly arose, causing plants and trees to bear fruit. By autumn, he plucked the *jiao* string to rouse *Jiazhong*, and a warm wind gently swirled, making plants and trees flourish. In summer, he struck the *yu* string to invoke *Huangzhong*, and frost and snow descended together, while rivers and ponds froze over. By winter, he plucked the *zhi* string to stir *Ruibin*, and the sun’s rays blazed fiercely, melting solid ice in an instant.\n\nAs the piece neared its end, he commanded the *gong* string to harmonize the four, and the *jing* wind soared, auspicious clouds floated, sweet dew fell, and spring waters surged. Master Xiang then clapped his chest and leapt in joy, exclaiming, “How subtle is your playing! Even *Qingjiao* of Master Kuang or the pitch-pipes of Zou Yan could not surpass it. They would clutch their zithers and flutes to follow in your wake.”\n\nThe commentary states: The Dao may be transmitted but not received; it may be attained but not seen. Being unseen, it cannot be received; only what can be transmitted may be attained. A good teacher stops at what can be transmitted; a good student is thus able to gain it. In his learning, Shiwen sought to transcend the instrument and awaken to the Dao; in his teaching, Master Xiang used the instrument to convey sound. Therefore, when Master Xiang first sent him home, Shiwen still sought a little more time to observe what would follow. Once he had attained it, he could reverse the workings of creation, alter the sequence of the four seasons, make the *jing* wind soar, auspicious clouds float, sweet dew descend in streams, and spring waters surge—all without ever leaving the moment his fingers moved the strings. Thus, the turning of yin and yang lay within his grasp. How wondrous!\n\nMaster Xiang, at this, clapped his chest and leapt in joy, marveling at its subtlety. Had Shiwen merely followed Master Xiang’s transmissible techniques to become what Master Xiang already knew, he would never have earned such praise. Therefore, though the diligent student may say it is better to seek a teacher, the noble person desires self-attainment.\n\nAlas! If the subtlety of a single art can reach such heights, then one who has attained the Dao could govern the world, bringing peace and prosperity—truly no difficult task.\n\nXue Tan studied singing under Qin Qing but had not mastered his teacher’s art when he declared himself proficient and took his leave. Qin Qing did not stop him but saw him off at the crossroads in the suburbs. There, he struck the rhythm and sang a mournful song, his voice shaking the trees and halting the passing clouds. Xue Tan then apologized and begged to return, never again daring to speak of leaving.\n\nThe commentary states: Those who study the Dao may be like Zheng Shiwen with Master Xiang—unaware of where his aspirations lay, sent home, only to return and earn his teacher’s marveling praise. Or they may be like Xue Tan with Qin Qing—believing they had mastered his art and leaving, only to apologize and beg to return, never again daring to speak of departure. This is what students must discern.\n\nQin Qing turned to his friend and said: “Long ago, Han E traveled east to Qi, running out of provisions. Passing through Yongmen, she sang for food. After she left, her lingering notes coiled around the beams for three days without fading, and the people nearby did not realize she had gone. At an inn, the innkeeper insulted her. Han E then sang a long, mournful lament, and the old and young of the village grieved, weeping and facing one another without eating for three days. They hurried to bring her back, and when she returned, she sang a joyful song. The villagers leapt and danced, unable to contain themselves, forgetting their former sorrow. They then richly rewarded her and sent her on her way. To this day, the people of Yongmen excel in singing and weeping, imitating Han E’s lingering voice.”\n\nThe commentary states: True sorrow is soundless yet mournful; true kinship is not smiling yet harmonious—meaning joy and grief cannot be feigned. Singing for food may not arise from sincere joy, and weeping in response to insult may not be true sorrow. Yet her art was so wondrous that the villagers, who had never known sorrow, wept and refused food upon hearing her lament; and those who had never known joy leapt and danced uncontrollably upon hearing her song. If feigned song and weeping can move people so deeply, how much more so when both performer and listener are genuine?\n\nHowever, her art only worked in the village of Yongmen. Had she sung in Qi, there would surely have been those who recognized its falsity. Thus, her lingering voice was imitated only in Yongmen.\n\nBo Ya was skilled at playing the zither, and Zhong Ziqi was skilled at listening. When Bo Ya played with the intention of climbing a high mountain, Zhong Ziqi said, “How fine! Towering like Mount Tai!” When his intention turned to flowing water, Zhong Ziqi said, “How fine! Vast like the Yangtze and Yellow River!” Whatever Bo Ya conceived, Zhong Ziqi always grasped it.\n\nOnce, Bo Ya traveled to the northern side of Mount Tai. Suddenly, a violent storm arose, and he took shelter beneath a cliff. Overcome with sorrow, he took up his zither and played. First, he composed a piece for the ceaseless rain, then shifted to the sound of crumbling mountains. With each melody, Zhong Ziqi fully understood its essence. Bo Ya then set down his zither and sighed, “How fine! How fine! Your listening is such that your thoughts and images mirror my heart. Where can my music escape you?”\n\nThe commentary states: There are sounds, sounds of sounds, and that which sounds the sounds—all are heard. Once heard, the grandest does not exceed the *gong* note, and the subtlest does not go beyond the *yu*. By examining the purity or turbidity of *gong* and *yu* and comparing them to human affairs, where can sound escape? Thus, Ziqi’s skill in listening is not so extraordinary. Moreover, Bo Ya’s zither gained renown through Ziqi, while Ziqi’s listening would have no outlet for its artistry without Bo Ya. Liezi praised them for valuing the understanding of sound.\n\nYet Ji Zha’s observation of music surpasses even this.\n\n*Explication of the Perfect Dao and Its Virtue, Scroll Ten Concludes*\n*Explication of the Perfect Dao and Its Virtue, Scroll Eleven*\n\nPresented by Jiang Yu, a *hesheng* of the Hangzhou Prefectural Academy of Song, for the imperial perusal.\n\n**Tang Wen**\n\nKing Mu of Zhou, on his western expedition, crossed the Kunlun Mountains but did not reach Yan Mountain. On his return journey, before reaching the Central States, he encountered a craftsman named Yan Shi who offered his services. The king summoned him and asked, “What skills do you possess?”\n\nYan Shi replied, “I shall do as Your Majesty commands. However, I have already created something I wish you to see first.”\n\nThe king said, “Come with it tomorrow, and we shall observe it together.”\n\nThe next day, Yan Shi presented himself to the king. The king summoned him and asked, “Who is the person accompanying you?”\n\nYan Shi answered, “This is my creation, one capable of performing.”\n\nThe king scrutinized it closely. It walked, bowed, and raised itself—truly like a man. When the craftsman pressed its chin, it sang in perfect harmony with the pitch; when he lifted its head, it danced in precise rhythm. Its transformations were boundless, responding to every intention. The king took it for a real person and had his concubine, Lady Sheng, join him in observing it.\n\nAs the performance neared its end, the performer winked at the king’s attendants. Enraged, the king was about to execute Yan Shi on the spot. Terrified, Yan Shi immediately disassembled the performer before the king’s eyes, revealing it to be an assemblage of leather, wood, glue, lacquer, and pigments—white, black, and vermilion. The king examined it closely: within were liver, gallbladder, heart, lungs, spleen, kidneys, intestines, and stomach; without were sinews, bones, joints, skin, hair, teeth, and nails—all artificial yet perfectly formed. When reassembled, it appeared as before.\n\nThe king tested it: when he removed its heart, its mouth could not speak; when he removed its liver, its eyes could not see; when he removed its kidneys, its feet could not walk. Only then did King Mu smile in wonder and say, “Can human craftsmanship truly rival the workings of creation?”\n\nHe ordered a secondary chariot to carry Yan Shi back with him.\n\nBan Shu’s cloud-ladder and Mo Di’s flying kite were once deemed the pinnacle of skill. Yet when their disciples Dongmen Jia and Qin Guli heard of Yan Shi’s craft, they informed their masters, who thereafter never dared speak of their arts again and instead constantly wielded compass and square.\n\n**Commentary:** Though an artificial construct, once taught to perform, it becomes an incitement to licentiousness. Thus, its ability to sing in harmony and dance in rhythm makes its winking unremarkable. Human skill indeed possesses marvels akin to flying kites or jade paper—yet these are mere objects. Man is the spirit of all things; surely he cannot be imitated by such assemblages. Yan Shi’s creation could walk, bow, and raise itself indistinguishably from a human, sing in perfect pitch, dance in exact measure, and transform endlessly at will—only then did it attain supreme mastery. Thus, even the skills of Ban Shu and Mo Di paled in comparison, and they dared not speak of their arts again, instead constantly wielding compass and square.\n\nAlas! Human life—how could its potential be limited to Yan Shi’s craft? Yet men often pass through life without self-awareness, and when they encounter such marvels, they merely admire the skill, missing the deeper truth. How superficial!\n\nGan Ying, an ancient master archer, could draw his bow and cause beasts to crouch and birds to descend. His disciple Fei Wei learned archery from him and surpassed his teacher. Another disciple, Ji Chang, studied under Fei Wei.\n\nFei Wei said, “First learn not to blink, then we may speak of archery.”\n\nJi Chang returned home and lay beneath his wife’s loom, gazing upward at the moving shuttle. After two years, even when a needle’s tip brushed his eyelashes, he did not blink. He reported this to Fei Wei.\n\nFei Wei said, “Not yet. You must learn to see before you can shoot. See the small as large, the faint as clear—then come tell me.”\n\nJi Chang suspended a louse from a window with a hair and gazed at it from the south. Within ten days, it gradually appeared larger. After three years, it seemed as big as a cartwheel. When he looked at other things, they all appeared like hills and mountains. Then, using a bow of Yan horn and an arrow of northern reeds, he shot the louse, piercing its heart while the hair remained unbroken. He reported this to Fei Wei.\n\nFei Wei leapt up, striking his chest, and said, “You have mastered it!”\n\n**Commentary:** Learning not to blink means not allowing external things to alter oneself. Mastering vision means transforming things through perception. If I am not altered by things, but things are transformed by me, then I can see the small as large and the faint as clear—thus, the ability to hit the mark lies within me. This is how Ji Chang pierced the louse.\n\nAfter Ji Chang had mastered Fei Wei’s techniques, he calculated that only one man in the world could rival him and plotted to kill Fei Wei. They met in the wild, and as they exchanged arrows, their shafts collided midair and fell to the ground without raising dust. Fei Wei’s arrows were exhausted first, leaving Ji Chang with one final shot. When he loosed it, Fei Wei deflected it with the tip of a thorn branch, missing not a hair’s breadth. Thereupon, the two men wept, cast aside their bows, and bowed to each other on the road, pledging to become father and son. They swore an oath, cutting their arms, never to teach their arts to others.\n\n**Commentary:** Mencius said, “Is the arrow-maker less humane than the armor-maker?”—meaning one must be cautious in choosing one’s craft. Thus, after Ji Chang mastered Fei Wei’s techniques, he plotted to kill him. For the learning of Ji Chang and the teaching of Fei Wei both ultimately aimed at harming others—this was their inevitable end. When Pang Meng learned archery from Yi and mastered his Way, he too killed Yi—this was the same principle. Mencius deemed Pang Meng’s killing of Yi justified, for Yi bore some blame in choosing unworthy companions. Had one studied archery like Master Gong’s disciple Si, how could one bear to use the Master’s Way to harm him? Fortunate was Fei Wei’s survival! Had he not deflected that final arrow with a thorn branch, he would not have escaped. Thus, the gentleman’s pursuit of learning is the archery of non-archery.\n\nThe teacher of Zaofu was named Tai Dou.\n\nWhen Zaofu first began his apprenticeship in charioteering, he observed rites with utmost humility, yet Tai Dou remained silent for three years. As Zaofu’s reverence grew ever more meticulous, Tai Dou finally spoke: “The ancient poem says: *The son of a master bowyer must first weave baskets; the son of a master smith must first sew furs.* First observe my gait. When your stride matches mine, then you may take up the six reins and drive the six horses.”\n\nZaofu replied, “I shall follow your command.”\n\nTai Dou then erected wooden planks to form a path, barely wide enough for his feet, measuring each step as he placed them. He walked upon them, pacing back and forth without a single misstep. Zaofu learned this, and in three days mastered its art.\n\nTai Dou sighed, “How swift your grasp! You have attained it with such speed. All charioteering is like this. When you walked just now, your feet responded to your heart. Extend this to driving: harmony in the reins and bit, urgency and ease in the harmony of the lips, proper measure within the breast, and disciplined rhythm in the grip of the hands. When the center is inwardly aligned and outwardly attuned to the horse’s will, you can advance and retreat along the line, turn and curve within the compass, traverse great distances with energy to spare—truly, you have grasped the technique.\n\nWhen the bit is mastered, the reins respond; when the reins are mastered, the hands respond; when the hands are mastered, the heart responds. Then you need not rely on sight, nor urge with the whip. The mind is at ease, the body upright, the six reins unconfused, and the twenty-four hooves land without error. In turning or advancing, retreating or halting, all is in perfect measure. Then the wheels leave no excess track beyond their path, the hooves no ground untouched. Neither mountain valleys nor level plains are perceived as different—they are as one. My art is exhausted. Remember this well.”\n\nA commentary states: In all affairs under heaven, there are those that seem slow yet are urgent, appear delayed yet take precedence. What the foolish fail to perceive, the wise discern. Thus, in the art of charioteering, none do not assume that mastery begins with grasping the reins. Yet the teaching of Taidou first had the student observe its intent—just as archers first learn to see, bowmakers first craft baskets, and smiths first prepare furs. From this we know that even in the most minor of skills, without learning from a master, one will never recognize the essential first step. Even the wise cannot achieve mastery without cause. How swiftly Zaofu mastered the craft in three days! Yet had he not maintained utmost humility, enduring three years without instruction while observing ritual with ever greater care, his learning would not have been sincere, his thought not precise—how could he have attained it so swiftly? Extending what he learned to charioteering, no technique remained unmastered.\n\nNow, to harness horses to a carriage and guide them with reins—six horses, twenty-four hooves—if a single hoof missteps, the excellence of all six is lost. Such is the difficulty of driving. Therefore, the skilled driver does not rely on sight, nor does he urge with the whip. To watch with the eyes is to see ever more confusion and fail to encompass all; to drive with the whip is to exhaust strength without achieving order. Only when inwardly attuned to the heart’s center and outwardly responsive to bit and reins can one remain at ease amid peril or level ground, urgency or leisure, the body ever upright whether advancing, retreating, turning, or curving. Then the wheels leave no excess track beyond their path, the hooves no ground untouched. \"No excess track\" does not mean no track at all, but that the wheels encounter no obstruction; \"no ground untouched\" does not mean no ground remains, but that peril and level ground offer no choice. When driving reaches this point, one no longer knows whether it is the self driving the horse or the horse drawing the carriage—all appears as one. Is this not wondrous? This is how Zaofu could command King Mu’s chariot, roaming freely to distant lands, crossing Kunlun, witnessing the sun’s descent, covering ten thousand *li* in a single day.\n\nAlas! The subtlety of charioteering is profound indeed. Its art attains such marvels—how can mere \"skill\" suffice to name it? If Zaofu were to cast aside his reins and apply his mastery to the Dao, who could say it were impossible?\n\nYangzi said: \"He who rules all under heaven must examine his driving.\" Examine this alone.\n\nWei Hei Luan killed Qiu Bingzhang out of personal enmity. Bingzhang’s son, Laidan, sought to avenge his father’s death. Laidan’s *qi* was fierce, his form exposed; he ate by counting grains and moved with the wind. Though enraged, he could not wield weapons to exact revenge. Ashamed to borrow strength from others, he swore to slaughter Hei Luan with his bare hands and sword.\n\nA commentary states: Black is the color of *yin*; egg is the form of *yin*. Wei represents lofty prominence. Wei Hei Luan is the image of old *yin*. Bing means radiant flourishing; zhang, the completion of pattern.\n\nQiu represents land elevated at its center. Without Bingzhang, it is the image of old *yang*. Dan, discarding *yang*, becomes Laidan—thus the direction where young *yang* gradually grows. The *Yijing* states: \"When *yin* doubts *yang*, there must be strife.\" *Yang* ever dwells in the great summer, its task being to give life, nurture, and foster growth, while *yin* retreats and lies concealed. Yet toward *yang* it cannot but harbor enmity. Thus, when *yin* comes to power in the depths of winter, it imprisons creatures, seizing and slaying Qiu Bingzhang. Yet even as *yin* flourishes, a single spark of *yang* qi has already begun to germinate in the palace of Yellow Bell—hence Laidan’s resolve to avenge his father’s death. *Yang* is inherently firm, so Laidan’s *qi* is fiercely potent, his form starkly exposed. Still in its germinal stage, he counts grains to eat and moves with the wind. Though enraged, he cannot wield weapons to exact revenge. Yet because his nature is unyielding, he feels shame in borrowing strength from others and swears to slaughter Wei Hei Luan with his bare hands and sword.\n\nWei Hei Luan’s will is fierce beyond all others; his strength matches that of a hundred men. His sinews, bones, skin, and flesh are not of mortal kind. He stretches his neck to meet the blade, bares his chest to receive the arrow; edges bend and points shatter, yet his body bears no mark. Confident in his might, he regards Laidan as a fledgling chick.\n\nA commentary states: *Yin*’s task is to carve and restrain, and now is the season when it wields power amid unyielding ice. Thus his will is fierce, his strength peerless, his skin and bones inhuman; he meets blades and arrows without a scratch, and sees Laidan as but a fledgling chick.\n\nLaidan’s friend, Shen Tuo, said: \"Your hatred for Wei Hei Luan is extreme, and his underestimation of you is excessive. What plan will you devise?\" Laidan, tears falling, replied: \"I beg you to devise one for me.\" Shen Tuo said: \"I have heard that Kong Zhou of Wei, a descendant of his lineage, obtained the treasured swords of the Yin emperor. When a mere boy wore one, he repelled the masses of three armies. Why not seek them?\" Laidan then went to Wei, met Kong Zhou, and performed the rites of a servant-charioteer. He first offered his wife and children as hostages, then spoke of his desire.\n\nA commentary states: The treasured sword is a divine instrument capable of governing and restraining. Yin means \"center,\" akin to the *yin* of mid-spring. The treasured swords of the Yin emperor embody the harmonious *qi* that governs *yin* and *yang*, discerning and unerring. That his ancestor obtained them shows their Dao has endured since antiquity. The divine instrument is supremely subtle, with utmost softness driving the utmost hardness throughout the world. Thus a mere boy wearing one could repel the masses of three armies. Shen Tuo is one who can extend justice to those wronged, hence he devised this plan for Laidan. Kong Zhou is one who can navigate the utmost principles of human affairs, so Shen Tuo sent Laidan to seek the swords from such a man. Performing the rites of a servant-charioteer expresses utmost reverence. Offering his wife and children first pledges his sincerity.\n\nKong Zhou said: \"I possess three swords; choose whichever you wish. None can kill a man, but first let me describe their forms. The first is called *Han Guang* (Containing Light): when you look, it cannot be seen; when you wield it, its presence is unknown. Where it touches, all boundaries dissolve; it passes through things, yet things remain unaware. The second is called *Cheng Ying* (Bearing Shadow): at the juncture of dawn’s first light and the break of day, or at dusk’s twilight and the onset of night, if you face north and observe closely, faintly, as if something exists, yet its form cannot be discerned. Where it touches, there is a faint sound; it passes through things, yet things are not harmed. The third is called *Xiao Lian* (Night Forged): in broad daylight, you see its shadow but not its light; at night, you see its light but not its form. When it strikes an object, it passes with a sound like *huo* (a sharp crack), then seals instantly. You sense its swiftness, yet it draws no blood. These three treasures have been passed down for thirteen generations, yet never put to use. They remain sealed in their cases, never once opened.\"\n\nA commentary states: *Han Guang* preserves its light without shining—this describes the divine’s subtlety in all things. It cannot be seen because it has no form; its presence is unknown when wielded because it has no use. Where it touches, boundaries dissolve; it passes through things, yet things remain unaware—this is the Dao’s hidden constancy. *Cheng Ying* already has a shadow to bear. At the juncture of dawn’s first light and the break of day, or at dusk’s twilight and the onset of night—these are the times when *yin* and *yang* intersect. Seeking it by returning to the root, faintly, as if something exists, yet ultimately it cannot be discerned. Where it touches, there is a faint sound; it passes through things, yet things are not harmed—this is stirring the myriad things without opposition. *Xiao Lian* already has a form. In broad daylight, you see its shadow, for it is employed by *yang*. At night, you see its light, for it is governed by *yin*. Yet you see its shadow but not its light, its light but not its shadow—it does not yet appear as a distinct entity. When it strikes an object, it passes with a sharp sound, then seals instantly. You sense its swiftness, yet it draws no blood—it moves through the myriad things, giving life and nurturing, alternating flourishing and decline, its transformations endless. It compels those that live and transform to live and transform without cease, which may be called the swiftness of things. Yet the divine’s workings enter the formless through the seamless—this is the instant sealing after passing. Though swift, it does not harm things, nor can things harm it—this is drawing no blood. Passed down for thirteen generations, this speaks of traversing the cycles of *yin* and *yang*, enduring since antiquity. Never put to use, this is called the uselessness of the divine. Sealed in their cases, their concealment is profound. Never once opened, this is the absence of flaws in the divine.\n\nLaidan said: \"Even so, I must request the lowest of them.\" Kong Zhou then returned his wife and children and, after seven days of purification, at the time between dusk and darkness, knelt and presented the lowest sword. Laidan bowed twice and received it before departing.\n\nA commentary states: The divine is that which subtly brings forth the myriad things.\n\nWithin the order of generation and transformation, when likened to form and appearance, there are those resembling the three swords. As for the *Xiao Lian*, it first emerges from the Great Simplicity, marking the inception of substance—thus Laidan necessarily requested the lowest of them, and Kong Zhou returned his wife and children, preserving the Way of mutual generation and pairing. The seven days of purification unify the will and forget the body. The time between dusk and darkness is the threshold of darkness and light, where the Dao is secretly transmitted. Laidan then took the sword and followed Black Egg. At that time, Black Egg lay drunk beneath the window, and from neck to waist, Laidan struck him thrice—Black Egg remained unaware. Taking Black Egg’s death as certain, Laidan hastened away. At the gate, he encountered Black Egg’s son and struck him three times, as though thrusting into emptiness. Black Egg’s son then laughed and said: \"Why so foolish as to beckon me thrice?\" Laidan, realizing the sword could not kill, sighed and returned home. When Black Egg awoke, he raged at his wife: \"Drunk, you exposed me, leaving my throat sore and my waist stiff.\" His son said: \"Earlier, Laidan came and met me at the gate, striking me three times—it also left my body aching and my limbs rigid. Did he seek to suppress me?\"\n\nA commentary states: Beneath the window lies the boundary of yin and yang. Drunk and sprawled, one is in a time of confusion and unawareness. When yin is at its zenith, only at the moment of their intersection and unawareness can it be truly harmed. Nevertheless, the sword of night-forged steel can only cause things to feel illness without drawing blood. Thus, when Laidan struck Black Egg with it, Black Egg raged at his wife, saying, \"You exposed me while drunk, leaving my throat sore and my waist stiff.\" When he struck Black Egg’s son, the son said, \"Earlier, you met me at the gate and beckoned me thrice—it also left my body aching and my limbs rigid.\" Laidan, realizing the sword could not kill, sighed and returned home. Yet though Black Egg remained unaware even as the blade struck, he still suffered a sore throat and stiff waist, his body gradually wasting away from that day. Thus, though there was a day of biting cold and a day of piercing frost, soon the spring sun rose warm, and the small departed while the great arrived. People are blind to the fact that the fourth month belongs to summer, unaware that its origin lay in Laidan’s subtle shift on that first day.\n\nI have traced the Dao of yin and yang: their mutual generation is like father and son, their pairing like husband and wife. In their alternating use, they are ever born and ever die; in their struggle, they are ever enraged and ever hostile. When imprisoned, they become illness; when in power, they flourish. Though their Dao requires nothing external, its function resides in things—such is the nature of yin and yang. All things’ natures and human actions are but servants of yin and yang. If one examines human emotions and the changes of things, the nature of yin and yang is found to encompass all principles without exception. Thus, there are cases like Wei Black Egg, who killed Qiu Bingzhang out of private enmity, and Laidan, who vowed to slaughter Black Egg with his own sword. Yet the principle of yin and yang is such that as one waxes, the other wanes, and they can never be entirely severed. Thus, though Laidan harbored the intent to kill Black Egg, he could not slay him. Had Black Egg been killable, the principle of generation and transformation would have nearly ceased. If so, how could Wei Black Egg have killed Qiu Bingzhang? For Qiu Bingzhang had already been used and overcome by the flourishing force, and thus could be killed. But Wei Black Egg was then in power and flourishing—how could he be killed? Moreover, at that time, not only was the yang qi subtly stirring in Laidan, but Wei Black Egg already had his wife and son. Thus, though the Dao of yin and yang holds that yang is born at *zi* and yin at *wu*, within yin there is yang, and within yang there is yin—their arising, growth, decline, and cessation are beyond all reckoning.\n\nHe who understands these words of *Liezi* has grasped more than half of the Dao.\n\nKing Mu of Zhou launched a great campaign against the Western Rong, who presented him with the *kunwu* sword and fire-washed cloth. The sword measured a foot and a span, its red-hot steel blade cutting jade as easily as mud. The fire-washed cloth, when washed, must be cast into fire: the cloth turns the color of flame, while the grime turns the color of cloth. Removed from the fire and shaken, it gleams as white as snow. The prince believed no such things existed and dismissed their accounts as false. Xiao Shu said: \"Does the prince cling so stubbornly to his own certainty, so stubbornly to his denial of principle?\"\n\nA commentary states: The *kunwu* sword and fire-washed cloth were gifts from the Western Rong, not possessions of the Central States. The prince, confined by what he had seen and heard, could not broadly comprehend the transformations and anomalies of things’ principles. To immediately dismiss such things as nonexistent and their accounts as false—is this not a denial of principle?\n\nThis chapter of *Liezi* wondrously extends beyond the bounds of heaven and earth. Whether the divine smelting of Nüwa’s stones, the Foolish Old Man’s moving of mountains, Kuafu’s pursuit of the sun, Bian Que’s healing of illness, Yanshi’s creation of the singing automaton, or Laidan’s wielding of the sword—nearly all expound the profoundest words of the boundless, clearing the obstructions of the mind, and reveal the wondrous principles of the infinite, opening what the eyes and ears cannot perceive. If even those of shallow knowledge and limited experience remain confined by what they see and hear, unable to deeply seek the ultimate principle, how can they ever free themselves from their shackles? Such is the intent behind concluding the chapter thus.\n\n**Tang’s Inquiry: A Commentary**\nAll things emerge from and return to the mechanism, each following its inherent nature and inclinations, endlessly transforming into myriad forms and shapes. There are things even Yu the Great could not see, Bo Yi could not hear, and Yi Jian could not record. Who can exhaust their changes? Yet though their forms differ, their natures are the same. The people of Longbo’s land may be vast, but their minds and wisdom differ not from those of the tiny Jiao Yao. The Jiao Yao may be small in stature, but their likes and dislikes differ not from those of the Longbo. The midge is minute, yet its life is not lacking; the roc is immense, yet its nature is not excessive. The great *chun* tree may live long, yet it too dies; the ephemeral mushroom may perish young, yet it too has lived. The ignorant are bewildered by the unevenness of things’ transformations, unaware that their natures remain unchanging. Thus, they boast of longevity and lament early death, cling to love and shun aversion, entangled and confused, toiling endlessly without cease.\n\nTherefore, *Liezi* employs *Tang’s Inquiry* to distinguish the great and small, same and different, vast and minute, long and short. In essence, if one seeks this chapter through the ultimate Dao, there are things like the sun’s distance, which a child can discern yet Confucius could not decide; things like Bian Que’s healing of illness, where Gong Yu and Qi Ying and their two households could not understand one another—all are deluded by changes in form, unaware that their fundamental nature is no different. If one knows what is shared, then everywhere is unity. Thus, Pujuzi’s archery can be used for angling, and the principles of archery and angling can be used to govern the state. Zheng Shiwen and Bo Ya achieved mastery of the zither through this, while Ziqi excelled in listening. Fei Wei and Ji Chang became renowned archers through this, and Zaofu attained precision in charioteering.\n\nYanshi’s creation of the automaton, Qin Qing’s mastery of song—these too arise from this same Dao. If these several masters had cast aside their arts to advance toward the Dao, who could say it was not so?\n\nAll these myriad transformations of the ten thousand things cannot escape the workings of yin and yang. Thus, in the end, Wei Hei Luan killed Bing Zhang of Qiu over a personal grudge, and Lai Dan plotted to avenge his father’s enmity.\n\nYet the inequality of things is the nature of things. If one wishes to make them equal, one must first grasp the Dao by which they may be made equal. To dismiss the transformations of the ten thousand things with indifference and claim one has achieved equality is like one who covers their eyes and plugs their ears, believing none can see or hear—how can this control the mind’s restless wanderings?\n\nIn the end, Prince Guo’s overconfidence in his own judgment and his obstinate distortion of principle stem from this very error.\n\n*Explication of the Perfect Dao of Profound Virtue*, Scroll Eleven, concludes\n\n*Explication of the Perfect Dao of Profound Virtue*, Scroll Twelve\nHumbly presented by Jiang Yu, Inner Student of the Hangzhou Prefecture School of the Song Dynasty\n*On Effort and Fate, Part One*\n\nEffort addressed Fate, saying: \"What are your achievements compared to mine?\"\nFate replied: \"What merit have you rendered to things that you would compare yourself to me?\"\nEffort said: \"Longevity or early death, success or failure, nobility or baseness, wealth or poverty—these are all within my power.\"\nFate said: \"The wisdom of Peng Zu did not surpass that of Yao and Shun, yet he lived eight hundred years. The talent of Yan Yuan did not fall below that of ordinary men, yet he died at thirty-two. The virtue of Confucius did not rank below that of feudal lords, yet he was besieged in Chen and Cai. The conduct of King Zhou of Yin did not surpass that of the Three Benevolent Ones, yet he occupied the throne. Ji Zha held no rank in Wu, while Tian Heng usurped the state of Qi. Boyi and Shuqi starved on Mount Shouyang, while the Ji clan grew richer than Zhan Qin. If these were within your power, why do the long-lived die young, the sagely suffer hardship while the perverse prosper, the worthy live in lowliness while the foolish enjoy honor, and the good remain poor while the wicked grow rich?\"\n\nEffort said: \"If it is as you say, then I have indeed no merit in things, yet why do things turn out thus? Is this not what you control?\"\nFate replied: \"Since it is called Fate, how can there be one who controls it? I merely follow the straight and yield to the crooked. Things live long or die young, succeed or fail, rise or fall, grow rich or poor—how can I comprehend them? How can I comprehend them?\"\n\n*Explication*:\nEffort is what man does; Fate is what Heaven ordains. Heaven does not depend on man, nor does man complete without Heaven. That effort is constrained by Fate, and Fate arises from effort, cannot easily be distinguished in terms of merit. Comparing the weightiest of efforts with the most tenuous of Fates, how can one say effort’s merit is greater? Comparing the most abundant of Fates with the most meager of virtues, how can one say Fate’s merit is not profound?\n\nThose who emphasize effort, though Fate governs, believe it arises from inherent nature and do not call it Fate. Those who emphasize Fate, though nature governs, believe it arises from Fate and do not call it nature. Both are one-sided views. Examining one aspect alone—Peng’s longevity and Yan’s early death—one might suspect they were determined by Fate. Yet not all like Peng live long, nor do all of Yan’s talent necessarily die young; perhaps this arises from effort. Thus, to say effort has merit in things yet plays no part in Fate is untenable; to say all things are governed by Fate with no role for effort is equally untenable.\n\nNevertheless, what arrives without being summoned, what occurs without knowing why—this is Fate. Since it is called Fate, it governs the ten thousand things without heeding them. If there were one who controlled it, how could it be called Fate? Thus, it follows the straight without exhaustion through all ages; it yields to the crooked, completing the ten thousand things without omission. Though one speaks of following, there is none who follows; though one speaks of yielding, there is none who yields. The straight is straight of itself; the crooked is crooked of itself. Longevity or early death, success or failure, nobility or baseness, wealth or poverty—these arise neither from Heaven nor from man. Like the raven’s blackness, the swan’s whiteness, the *chun* tree’s longevity, the mushroom’s brevity—all are self-determined. Who is the agent? Only that things act of themselves, with none acting upon them. Thus, these eight conditions in man are like plants whose roots determine their sprouts. Fine fruit follows blossoms; the finest grain’s fruit comes from its excellent seed. Though there be foul shoots, their growth must follow their roots. Tracing to their source, not even a hair’s deviation is found. How can one know that today’s abundance of Fate does not arise from past abundance of virtue? Or that today’s abundance of virtue does not accumulate for a future abundance of Fate? These are all unknowable.\n\nIf so, then Fate is not necessarily distinct from effort, nor effort from Fate. How then can one assert the existence of Fate? How can one deny it? Even Fate does not know why it is so. This is what makes it Fate. How can one hastily take the crude calculations of alleyway rustics, demanding recompense from the Creator, insisting that the worthy live long and the wicked die young, the wise be honored and the foolish debased, the good grow rich and the evil remain poor? Their failure to comprehend Fate is extreme.\n\nOnly those who truly know Fate follow Heaven’s natural principle, cultivate human effort without neglect, forget both longevity and early death, delight in both success and failure, adapt to both honor and wealth, and remain unchanged by poverty or riches. This is what the sage calls \"rejoicing in Heaven and knowing Fate,\" and the reason *Liezi* composed the chapter \"Effort and Fate.\" In *Zhuangzi*, the *Great Master* concludes with Zisang’s discourse on Fate, deeming this the ultimate teaching of the *Great Master*. Beigongzi said to Ximenzi: \"You and I live in the same age, yet you are successful. We belong to the same clan, yet you are respected.\"\n\nWe share the same appearance, yet you are beloved. We speak alike, yet your words are valued. We act the same, yet your conduct is deemed sincere. We serve in office together, yet you are honored. We till the soil together, yet you grow rich. We trade together, yet you profit. I wear coarse hemp, eat coarse grain and oysters, dwell in a thatched hut, and walk on foot. You wear embroidered silks, feast on fine millet and meat, live in a mansion with towering beams, and ride in a carriage drawn by four horses. At home, you dismiss me with cheerful disdain; at court, you display open contempt. You do not visit me, nor do we travel together—this has been so for years. Do you truly believe your virtue surpasses mine?\"\n\nXimenzi replied: \"I have no way to know the truth of this. You pursue affairs and remain poor; I pursue them and succeed. Is this proof of our differing worth? Yet you claim we are the same—your face is shameless indeed.\"\n\nBeigongzi had no reply. He left in distress. On the road, he met Master Dongguo, who asked: \"Where have you been, that you return with such a halting step and a look of deep shame?\"\n\nBeigongzi recounted what had happened. Master Dongguo said: \"I will relieve your shame. Let us go together to question Ximenzi. Ask him: 'Why do you so deeply humiliate Beigongzi?' Press him to explain.\"\n\nXimenzi said: \"Beigongzi claims we share the same age, clan, appearance, speech, and conduct, yet differ in rank, wealth, and poverty. I told him: 'I have no way to know the truth of this. You pursue affairs and remain poor; I pursue them and succeed. Is this proof of our differing worth? Yet you claim we are the same—your face is shameless indeed.'\"\n\nMaster Dongguo said: \"Your notion of 'worth' refers only to differences in talent and virtue. My understanding of 'worth' is different. Beigongzi is rich in virtue but poor in Fate; you are rich in Fate but poor in virtue. Your success is not due to wisdom, nor is his poverty due to folly. Both are Heaven’s doing, not man’s. Yet you boast of your favorable Fate, while Beigongzi feels shame for his virtue—neither of you recognizes the principle of what is inherently so.\"\n\nXimenzi said: \"Enough, Master. I dare not speak further.\"\n\nAfter Beigongzi returned home, he put on his coarse hemp robe and felt the warmth of fox and badger fur. He ate his coarse beans and tasted the savor of fine grain and meat. He sheltered in his thatched hut as if beneath the shade of a grand hall. He rode in his humble cart as if adorned with ornate carvings.\n\nAll his life, he remained at ease, unaware of honor or disgrace as belonging to others or to himself.\n\nMaster Dongguo heard of this and said: \"Beigongzi has slept long indeed—yet a single word could awaken him. How easily his sorrow was dispelled!\"\n\nExplanation:\nThe movement of the Heavenly Dao proceeds from west to north. You (酉) is the gate through which the myriad things close, hence the name Ximenzi. The north is where the myriad things are stored and where the essence of transformation is most profound, hence the name Beigongzi. Ximenzi, facing inward toward his dwelling, is thus rich in Fate but poor in virtue. Beigongzi, however, conceals himself deeply, and so is rich in virtue but poor in Fate.\n\nMaster Dongguo has labored through the trigram Kan and emerged into Zhen—he does not abide in non-action but moves into stillness through activity. Thus, he could dispel Beigongzi’s shame and awaken him.\n\nI have examined Fate: it arises from no governing agency yet arrives inevitably, something no living being can escape. Even the sages Yao, Shun, Yi, and Qi, or Confucius; the worthies Jizha, Zhan Qin, and Yanzi—all were bound by Fate and could not alter it throughout their lives. No wonder Beigongzi felt shame for his virtue, and Ximenzi boasted of his favorable Fate.\n\nYet if we say Fate arrives from no agency, then its coming is natural, with no one to bring it. If the bringer is fundamentally nonexistent, then who receives its constraints? Whether constrained or not depends on oneself alone. Thus, if one does not accept Fate, one is constrained by it; if one understands Fate, one constrains it rather than being constrained by it.\n\nFrom this, sages may be impoverished and the benevolent may die young; the good may be poor and the worthy may be lowly. Yet we have never heard of Fate altering the conduct of sages and worthies. Therefore, when Beigongzi heard Master Dongguo’s words and recognized the principle of what is inherently so, he remained at ease all his life, unaware of honor or disgrace as belonging to others or to himself.\n\nIf this is so, can Fate truly constrain him? This is the achievement of one who has attained the Way of Fate.\n\nGuan Yiwu and Bao Shuya shared a bond of profound friendship, dwelling together in Qi. Guan Yiwu served Prince Jiu, while Bao Shuya served Prince Xiaobai. The Qi ruling house was rife with favored clans, and the lines of legitimate and illegitimate succession ran parallel. The people of the state feared chaos. Guan Zhong and Shao Hu escorted Prince Jiu in flight to Lu, while Bao Shuya escorted Prince Xiaobai to Ju. Soon after, Gongsun Wuzhi staged a rebellion, leaving Qi without a ruler, and the two princes vied to return. Guan Yiwu clashed with Xiaobai on the road to Ju, loosing an arrow that struck Xiaobai’s belt hook. Once Xiaobai ascended the throne, he coerced Lu into executing Prince Jiu; Shao Hu died for him, while Guan Yiwu was imprisoned. Bao Shuya said to Duke Huan: “Guan Yiwu is capable—he can govern the state.” Duke Huan replied: “He is my enemy. I wish to kill him.” Bao Shuya said: “I have heard that a worthy lord harbors no private grudges. Moreover, one who can serve his own master can surely serve a lord. If you seek hegemony over kings, none but Yiwu will suffice. You must pardon him.” Thereupon, Guan Zhong was summoned. Lu returned him to Qi, and Bao Shuya welcomed him beyond the city gates, releasing him from captivity. Duke Huan treated him with reverence, placing him above the ministers Gao and Guo. Bao Shuya humbled himself before him, entrusting him with state affairs, and he was styled “Uncle Zhong.” Duke Huan thus became a hegemon.\n\nGuan Zhong once sighed: “In my youth, when I was poor and distressed, I once traded goods with Bao Shu, taking more than my share of the profits. Bao Shu did not deem me greedy, knowing I was impoverished. I once devised a plan for Bao Shu that ended in utter failure, yet he did not think me foolish, knowing that circumstances may be favorable or unfavorable. I was employed three times and thrice dismissed by my lords, yet Bao Shu did not consider me worthless, knowing I had not met with the right moment. I fought in three battles and fled all three, yet Bao Shu did not think me cowardly, knowing I had an aged mother. When Prince Jiu was defeated, Shao Hu died for him, while I endured imprisonment and humiliation. Bao Shu did not think me shameless, knowing I did not scorn minor setbacks but felt shame if my name were not renowned throughout the world. My parents gave me life, but Bao Shu truly knew me.” Thus the world praises the fine friendship of Guan and Bao, and Xiaobai’s skill in employing the capable. Yet in truth, there was no fine friendship, nor any skill in employing the capable.\n\nIn truth, there was no fine friendship, nor any skill in employing the capable—not because there existed some other fine friendship or some other skill in employing the capable. Shao Hu did not choose to die; he had no choice but to die. Bao Shuya did not choose to recommend the worthy; he had no choice but to recommend them. Xiaobai did not choose to employ his enemy; he had no choice but to employ him.\n\nExplanation: In the affairs of the world, whatever succeeds beyond the reach of human foresight, whatever arrives without being summoned—this is Fate. When Guan Yiwu and Bao Shuya first shared their profound bond, their hearts could be said to have known no distance. Later, when Yiwu served Prince Jiu and Bao Shu served Prince Xiaobai, though their lords differed, their hearts remained unchanged. When the two princes contended for entry and clashed on the road to Ju, and Guan Zhong’s arrow struck Duke Huan, at that moment, how could Yiwu have harbored any intention of serving Duke Huan? After Duke Huan ascended the throne and coerced Lu into killing Prince Jiu, he even petitioned Lu to surrender Guan Zhong as his enemy, wishing to vent his hatred by mincing him—how then could Duke Huan have harbored any intention of employing Uncle Zhong? Even if Bao Shuya could forget the enmity of the Ju road and not abandon their former friendship, he should still have refrained from recommending Guan Zhong’s worth, given Duke Huan’s hatred. Moreover, Guan Zhong, in serving Prince Jiu, had failed to achieve success beforehand and failed to die for him afterward—his worthiness was hardly exemplary. Yet now, Bao Shuya disregarded Qi’s suspicions and recommended him; Duke Huan forgot his lack of service to Prince Jiu and, setting aside his enmity, employed him; Guan Zhong, too, did not feel shame for his past imprisonment and humiliation, nor did he decline his position, but devoted himself to Qi, forgetting his former service to Prince Jiu. None of this could have been foreseen by human foresight.\n\nOnce Guan Zhong was employed by Qi, he filled the granaries, clarified rites and norms, enriched the state, and strengthened its armies. He turned misfortune into fortune and defeat into victory, ultimately uniting the feudal lords nine times and rectifying the world. The people have reaped his benefits to this day. Thus Confucius praised him, saying: “Were it not for Guan Zhong, we would still be wearing our hair loose and fastening our robes on the left.” Was Guan Zhong’s contribution to later generations and the world at large a trifling one? Indeed, Guan Zhong did not cling to the petty fidelity of common men and women, nor did he drown himself in a ditch. Had Bao Shuya’s words gone unheeded and Duke Huan’s enmity remained unresolved, how could Bao Shuya have preserved their friendship? Where could Guan Zhong have applied his talents?\n\nNevertheless, Guan Zhong ultimately achieved the great feat of uniting the feudal lords and rectifying the world, so that the people have reaped his benefits to this day. Thus Bao Shuya’s recommendation of his enemy, Duke Huan’s employment of his enemy, and Guan Zhong’s enduring humiliation in Lu to devote himself to Qi—all these were matters of necessity, not choice. From this perspective, when the world praises the fine friendship of Guan and Bao and Xiaobai’s skill in employing the capable, it is not that there was any fine friendship or any skill in employing the capable. All was the work of Fate, not something within human power. If one claims there was fine friendship, then what was the state of Guan Zhong’s friendship during the battle on the road to Ju? If one claims there was skill in employing the capable, why did Duke Huan’s employment of Guan Zhong depend on Bao Shuya’s words? The point is not that only Duke Huan and Guan and Bao were thus. In all cases, the trust between friends and the duty between lord and minister are no different. Yet upon close examination, the conduct of these several men was all marked by impartiality of heart. With hearts fixed on perfect impartiality, friendship need not be preserved to be preserved, enmity need not be abandoned to be abandoned, and loyalty need not be demonstrated to be demonstrated.\n\nThis was the foundation upon which Duke Huan established his hegemony.\n\nAlas! If one can but make one’s heart impartial, then in all things it will naturally accord with the spontaneous workings of Heaven’s mandate. Why, then, should one debase oneself and bend the Way in petty pursuit of conformity to the whims of others?\n\nMoreover, even the governance of a hegemon—achieved through cunning strategy and force—was not something within human power to accomplish. Extending this principle upward, we see that the Way of the August Sovereigns, the virtue of the Divine Emperors, and the radiant governance of the True Kings were all spontaneous and self-arising, not made by human effort. This much is evident.\n\nWhen Guan Yiwu fell ill, Duke Xiao Bai visited him and said, “Your illness, Uncle Zhong, has grown grave. There is no need to avoid speaking of it. If it should become critical, to whom shall I entrust the state?”\n\nGuan Yiwu asked, “Whom does my lord desire?”\n\nDuke Xiao Bai replied, “Bao Shuya would be suitable.”\n\nGuan Yiwu said, “He is not. He is a man of integrity and purity, a fine gentleman. Yet toward those who do not measure up to him, he does not associate with them. Once he hears of another’s fault, he never forgets it. If you place him in charge of the state, above he will probe the ruler, and below he will oppose the people. His offense against you, my lord, will not be long in coming.”\n\n*Explanation:* People often cite Guan Zhong’s refusal to entrust the state to Bao Shuya as evidence of his judgment. In truth, Guan Zhong knew Bao Shuya’s talents were not suited to governing the state, for he feared Bao Shuya would offend the ruler. Is it not better to spare him the burden of governance and allow him to remain whole, rather than to place him in office only to incur guilt? This was Guan Zhong’s way of preserving their friendship.\n\nDuke Xiao Bai asked, “Then who would be suitable?”\n\nGuan Yiwu replied, “If you must choose, then Xi Peng will do. His character is such that above he forgets his lord, and below the people do not rebel. He feels shame for not equaling the Yellow Emperor and pities those who do not equal himself. One who distributes virtue to others is called a sage; one who distributes wealth to others is called a worthy. To rule others with one’s worthiness is never to win their allegiance; to humble oneself before the worthy is never to fail in winning their allegiance. In governing the state, he does not pry; in managing his household, he does not spy. If you must choose, then Xi Peng will do.”\n\nThus, Guan Yiwu did not slight Bao Shuya out of preference, nor did he favor Xi Peng by choice. To favor one at the outset may lead to slighting him in the end; to slight one in the end may follow from favoring him at the start. The ebb and flow of favor and disfavor do not depend on me.\n\n*Explanation:* “Above he forgets his lord” refers to his governance being unobtrusive. “Below the people do not rebel” refers to his people being simple and sincere. Feeling shame for not equaling the Yellow Emperor means he does not presume upon his own superiority. Pitying those who do not equal himself means his heart is set on rescuing others with goodness. To distribute virtue to others is to enable the people to return to their true nature and restore their original condition—this is the Way of the sage. To distribute wealth to others is to ensure the people lack nothing in providing for their parents above and nurturing their children below—this is the virtue of the worthy. To rule others with one’s worthiness is like a mountain’s barren slopes; to humble oneself before the worthy is like a marsh’s fertile growth.\n\nAs for “in governing the state, he does not pry; in managing his household, he does not spy,” this does not mean he truly fails to see or hear. Rather, his Way is sufficient to embrace all things. Herein lies the reason Xi Peng was suitable and Bao Shuya was not.\n\nAn ancient saying goes: “Without blindness and deafness, one cannot achieve great success.” This is precisely the point.\n\nIn the *Classic of Poetry*, the preface to the *Gejü* speaks of the Wei ruler’s treacherous miserliness and narrow impatience, while the poem itself says: “It is this narrow heart that is the target of reproach.” The harm of a narrow heart to governance is thus made clear.\n\nWhen one walks the path with others, the ebb and flow of favor and disfavor follow the principle of perfect impartiality and the natural order of things, not one’s own will. Only Guan, Bao, and Xi understood this. Thus, the waxing and waning of their relationships adhered to Heaven’s principle and did not follow personal inclination. Was this not the reason the governance of Qi could honor the Zhou and strengthen the state?\n\n*Explication of the Perfect Dao of Primal Virtue*, Scroll Twelve—Concluded\n*Explication of the Perfect Dao of Primal Virtue*, Scroll Thirteen\n\nSubmitted by your humble student, Jiang Yu, an Inner Hall scholar of the Hangzhou Prefecture Academy of Song:\n\n**On the Interplay of Effort and Fate**\n\nDeng Xi wielded the doctrine of \"two possibilities,\" crafting endless arguments. During Zichan’s governance of Zheng, he composed the *Bamboo Penal Code*. The state of Zheng adopted it, yet Deng Xi repeatedly challenged Zichan’s administration. Zichan yielded to him. Zichan then seized and executed him, swiftly putting him to death.\n\nThus, Zichan did not *choose* to employ the *Bamboo Penal Code*—he had no choice but to use it. Deng Xi did not *choose* to humble Zichan—he had no choice but to yield. Zichan did not *choose* to execute Deng Xi—he had no choice but to kill him.\n\n*Explication*:\nZichan served as Zheng’s minister for three years, and the virtuous submitted while the wicked were transformed—his governance should have been unassailable. Yet Deng Xi repeatedly challenged and humbled him. Zheng adopted Deng Xi’s *Bamboo Penal Code*, yet though they should have cherished its author, they ultimately executed him. Such are the workings of principle beyond human reckoning.\n\nThe world claims that Zichan’s execution of Deng Xi for composing the *Bamboo Penal Code* was an act of personal agency, failing to recognize that there were, in truth, forces at play compelling him to use the code, to yield, and to kill. Emperor Wen of Han, moved by Lady Tiying’s plea, abolished corporal punishment—yet none in later generations could restore it. The same principle applies.\n\nAccording to *Xunzi* and the *Zuozhuan*, Si Zhuan’s execution of Deng Xi occurred *after* Zichan’s death, leading scholars to suspect an error in the classics. Yet the *Liezi* concerns itself solely with illuminating the Dao and elucidating principle—what it grasps is the essence, while the incidental is left aside. Why quibble over minor discrepancies in its words?\n\nTo live when life is possible is Heaven’s blessing.\nTo die when death is due is Heaven’s blessing.\n\nTo live when life is possible yet not to live is Heaven’s punishment.\nTo die when death is due yet not to die is Heaven’s punishment.\nTo be able to live or to die, and thus to live or to die—this exists.\nTo be unable to live or to die, and thus to die or to live—this too exists.\nYet life and death, neither of things nor of the self, are all a matter of fate, beyond the reach of wisdom’s contrivance.\n\n**Explanation:**\nTo live in health and peace, embracing virtue—this is to live.\nTo die in fullness of years, completing one’s fate—this is to die.\nThese are the cases of being able to live or to die, and thus to live or to die.\nThe *Hongfan* speaks of the Five Blessings—these are what are called Heaven’s blessings.\nTo live in misfortune, cut short by calamity, or to live in sickness, evil, sorrow, or poverty—these are what the *Hongfan* calls the Six Adversities, what are called Heaven’s punishments.\nTo live or die as one should is the constant principle of things.\nTo die or live unexpectedly is a matter of fortune or misfortune.\nLife and death are one—some deem it Heaven’s blessing, some Heaven’s punishment; some arise from the constant, some from the unexpected.\nEven the wisest should be able to discern their distinctions.\nYet the cause of life in life, the cause of death in death—at the very moment of receiving life, the determinant of death is already set.\nTo extinguish me in death, there is also a determinant of life.\nLife and death, life and death—externally, not to be seized by things; internally, not to be controlled by the self.\nAll is commanded by Heaven, beyond the reach of wisdom.\nWhat then is to be done?\nOnly by understanding this can life and death remain unaltered.\n\nThus it is said:\nProfound and boundless, the Dao of Heaven converges of itself.\nVast and undivided, the Dao of Heaven moves of itself.\nNeither Heaven nor Earth can transgress it, neither sages nor wisdom can interfere with it, neither ghosts nor spirits can deceive it.\nThe natural is silently accomplished, leveled and pacified, guided and welcomed.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\"Boundless\" is the residue of division; \"convergence\" is the gathering of movement.\n\"Profound\" speaks of what is hidden and hard to perceive; \"vast\" speaks of what is distant and without limit.\nThe manifest life of things converges with the Dao.\nSubtle and in harmony with the Dao, it moves with the constant Dao of Heaven.\nConverging and moving of itself, the myriad things likewise live and die of themselves.\nThough Heaven’s spirit and Earth’s abundance,\nthey cannot transgress its natural course;\nthough the subtlety of sages and wisdom,\nthey cannot interfere with its natural course;\nthough the numinous power of ghosts and spirits,\nthey cannot deceive its natural course.\nThus it is silently accomplished without words or action,\nleveled and pacified without bias or deviation,\nguided and welcomed without beginning or end.\nSuch is the ultimate of what fate enacts.\n\nSeason Liang, a friend of Yang Zhu, fell gravely ill after seven days. His sons gathered around weeping and sought physicians. Season Liang said to Yang Zhu, \"My sons are so unworthy—why do you not sing for them to enlighten them?\" Yang Zhu sang:\n\n\"Heaven does not know—\nhow could man awaken?\nNot blessed by Heaven,\nnor cursed by man.\nIs it I or you\nwho does not understand?\nPhysicians or shamans—\ndo they truly know?\"\n\nHis sons did not comprehend and ultimately summoned three physicians. The first was Master Jiao, the second Master Yu, and the third Master Lü. They examined his illness.\n\nMaster Jiao said to Season Liang, \"Your cold and warmth are imbalanced, your deficiency and excess disordered. Your illness arises from irregular eating and drinking, indulgence in sensual pleasures, and the scattering of essence and thought—neither Heaven nor ghosts are to blame. Though grave, it can be treated.\" Season Liang said, \"A common physician.\" He promptly dismissed him.\n\nMaster Yu said, \"From the beginning, your prenatal qi was insufficient, while your postnatal nourishment was excessive. The illness did not arise in a single day; its causes accumulated gradually. It cannot be cured.\" Season Liang said, \"A skilled physician.\"\n\nAnd he was about to eat.\n\nMaster Lü said, \"Your illness arises neither from Heaven, nor from man, nor from ghosts. When you received life and took form, there was already one who ordained it, and one who knew it. What can medicine and stone do for you?\"\n\nSeason Liang said, \"A divine physician.\" He then sent him away with great respect.\n\nSoon after, Season Liang’s illness resolved of itself.\n\nExplanation: The meaning of *jiǎo* is to grasp what is crooked and straighten it, which is not natural. Master Jiao’s medicine sought to attack the illness after it had already arisen in life—this is the way of common physicians. Master Yu spoke of compliance, so his medicine lay in the beginning of life, deeming the illness incurable—this is the way of skilled physicians. Master Lü spoke of synthesis, so his medicine equated life and death as one. His words emerged from before the receiving of life and form, entering the spirit with profound meaning—this is the way of divine physicians.\n\nThus did Season Liang accept life and death with such equanimity. Was it not for this that Yang Zhu, upon seeing his gate after his death, sang?\n\nLife is not preserved by valuing it, nor is the body enriched by cherishing it. Life is not cut short by despising it, nor is the body diminished by slighting it. Thus, valuing it may not preserve life, despising it may not bring death, cherishing it may not enrich the body, and slighting it may not diminish it. This seems contradictory, yet it is not. Life and death, enrichment and diminution, arise of themselves. Or valuing it may preserve life, despising it may bring death, cherishing it may enrich the body, and slighting it may diminish it. This seems compliant, yet it is not. Life and death, enrichment and diminution, still arise of themselves.\n\nExplanation: Life and death, enrichment and diminution, are already ordained before the receiving of life and form. How can valuing or despising, cherishing or slighting, add or subtract to them after life has begun? The body is the entrusted form of Heaven and Earth, and life is the entrusted compliance of Heaven and Earth. Since Heaven and Earth have already entrusted transformation to us, they cannot violate the natural boundaries of our allotment—how much less can these things, which are not yours to possess, be preserved or destroyed by valuing or despising, enriched or diminished by cherishing or slighting?\n\nNevertheless, valuing and despising, preservation and destruction, cherishing and slighting arise from perception. False distinctions of sameness and difference: the many perceive sameness, the solitary perceive difference. Taking sameness as compliance and difference as opposition—if one follows the inherent nature, where lie opposition or compliance? To call them opposition or compliance is but semblance, not reality. In their essence, all things are as they are.\n\nThus, tracing the origin of life and form, though life knows not the body, and the body knows not life, how much less can they know valuing or despising, cherishing or slighting? Nevertheless, Liezi discusses this to clarify that the subtleties of life and form all arise from the natural, intending to dispel the world’s delusions—those who cling to life in pursuit of principle, or who enslave their forms to profit.\n\nAs for those who honor life and revere the root, desiring to be entrusted with the world, they would rather tread the path of seeming compliance than act with carelessness.\n\nZhai Xiong said to King Wen: \"What is long cannot be lengthened, what is short cannot be shortened. What is lost in calculation—what is it?\"\n\nLaozi said to Guan Yin: \"Who knows the reason for what Heaven detests? To anticipate Heaven’s will, to weigh profit and harm, is not as good as ceasing.\"\n\nExplanation: That length and shortness cannot be altered is like the legs of ducks and cranes, which cannot be cut or extended. Before life and form existed, there was already one who ordained it. Calculation is like wisdom—what can wisdom do? All is Heaven alone.\n\nThus, what man detests is what Heaven detests. Does Heaven privately detest man? The reason must have its origin, but it is not limited to what the ears and eyes perceive, nor can it be known in an instant. To receive it compliantly is acceptable.\n\nBut to use wisdom as a chisel, to weigh and sharpen it, exhausting the spirit with reckless conjecture—*The Classic of Virtue* calls this \"foreknowledge,\" the flower of the Dao and the beginning of folly. Thus, he told Guan Yin that anticipating Heaven’s will and weighing profit and harm is not as good as ceasing.\n\nTo conjecture and often hit the mark—this is why Confucius detested Zigong.\n\nYang Bu asked: \"Here is a man whose age, words, talents, and appearance are like his brother’s. Yet their lifespans are like father and son, their status like father and son, their reputations like father and son, their affections and aversions like father and son. I am perplexed.\"\n\nYangzi said: \"The ancients had a saying, which I once understood and will tell you: What is so without knowing why it is so—that is fate. Now, in darkness and obscurity, in confusion and chaos, whether acting or not acting, days pass and come—who can know the reason? All is fate.\"\n\nExplanation: What lies within us is nature; what lies with Heaven is fate. Nature may be cultivated but not neglected; fate may be heeded but not interfered with. The noble person conducts himself with proper conduct and awaits fate—why would he desire to subtly seek this fortune through such means?\n\nYet Yang Zhu, in his petty calculations, measured the thickness and thinness of years, virtue, talent, and appearance, and reckoned the differences in lifespan, status, reputation, affection, and aversion, likening father and son to brothers. Brothers are spoken of in terms of following one another in age, while father and son are spoken of in terms of the inequality of honor and humility. This is called adding delusion to delusion—great delusion! He did not understand that fate is at work.\n\nIn darkness and obscurity, beyond the reach of wisdom’s illumination; in confusion and chaos, beyond the power of reason to discern—whether acting or not acting, one does not hide in nothingness nor stagnate in being. Days pass, moving with transformation; days come, appearing with the times. Who can know the reason? This is how creation subtly works all things.\n\nIf creation were to calculate what a person should do in life and respond accordingly, its way of generating all things would be shallow indeed.\n\nOne who trusts in fate knows neither long life nor early death; one who trusts in principle knows neither right nor wrong; one who trusts in the heart knows neither adversity nor compliance; one who trusts in nature knows neither safety nor peril. This is called having nothing to trust and nothing not to trust. Truly sincere and earnest—what should one reject, what should one embrace? What should one grieve, what should one rejoice? What should one do, what should one not do?\n\nExplanation: When we speak of knowing neither long life nor early death, right nor wrong, adversity nor compliance, safety nor peril, it is not that these do not exist. Consider how Yan Hui lived briefly while Robber Zhi lived long—even if a man of the Dao could truly trust in fate, how could he grossly misjudge others, calling Yanzi long-lived and Pengzu short-lived? He would simply allow life and death to follow their natural course without claiming them as his own. Only by not claiming them do both long life and early death proceed unimpeded—this is what it means to say they are \"not known.\" The same applies to right and wrong, adversity and compliance, safety and peril.\n\nTo say there is nothing to trust refers to knowing neither long life nor early death, neither right nor wrong, neither adversity nor compliance, neither safety nor peril. To say there is nothing not to trust refers to trusting in fate, principle, the heart, and nature. In this state, likes and dislikes do not arise, so there is nothing to avoid or pursue. Sorrow and joy do not manifest, so there is no grief or delight. Following what is not done, there is nothing done; following what is done, there is nothing not done. This may be called true and earnest. \"True\" means pure and without falsity; \"earnest\" means real and without delusion.\n\nThe book of the Yellow Emperor states: The perfected person dwells as though dead, moves as though mechanical. He does not know why he dwells, nor why he does not dwell; he does not know why he moves, nor why he does not move. He does not know why others observe changes in his countenance, nor does he say that others’ lack of observation leaves his countenance unchanged. Alone he comes, alone he goes, alone he enters, alone he departs—who can obstruct him?\n\nExplanation: To dwell as though dead means the heart is like dead ashes—it rests of itself, without intention. To move as though mechanical means to act like a crossbow’s trigger—it responds to things before moving. Moving or resting with the times, dwelling or not dwelling, acting or not acting—all follow their natural course, and none are known. In this state, self and things are both forgotten, and seeing and hearing are both extinguished—what observation remains? Flesh and bone are wholly dissolved, and countenance is but a temporary vessel—what change could there be? Transcending all, solitary and unique, with no counterpart—alone he enters, alone he departs, alone he comes, alone he goes. Who could obstruct him?\n\nThe conduct of ordinary people differs entirely. Their distinction between inner and outer is unsettled, their boundary between honor and disgrace unclear. They take having a name as honor, having no name as disgrace. Whether their countenance changes or not depends on whether others observe them. Thus they fear authority, fear punishment, fear ghosts, fear others, their five viscera knotted with sorrow, their bodies shackled in restraint. All their lives they toil without respite, perishing with the transformations—is this not lamentable? Why not reflect: I am myself—what need have I of others? If one truly examines one’s own self, then others’ observation or lack of it is of no concern, and one’s countenance need not change. Thus the perfected person does not depart from the real, while ordinary people cannot perceive the solitary—is there any other reason? It lies solely in oneself.\n\n*Explication of the Perfect Virtue of Primordial Emptiness, Scroll Thirteen Concluded*\n*Explication of the Perfect Virtue of Primordial Emptiness, Scroll Fourteen*\n\nSubmitted by Your Servant Jiang Yu, Inner Hall Student of the Hangzhou Prefecture Academy\n\n**On the Distribution of Power and Fate**\n\nMo Xi, Shan Zhi, Tan Xuan, and Bie Fu—these four roamed the world together, each fulfilling their aspirations. Though they spent their lives in one another’s company, they never truly knew one another’s hearts, for each believed their own wisdom to be profound.\n\nQiao Ning, Yu Zhi, Nü Zhuo, and Pian Pi—these four roamed the world together, each fulfilling their aspirations. Though they spent their lives in one another’s company, they never spoke of their arts, for each believed their own cunning to be subtle.\n\nYu Ya, Qing Lu, Jian Ji, and Ling Sui—these four roamed the world together, each fulfilling their aspirations. Though they spent their lives in one another’s company, they never awakened to one another’s insights, for each believed their own talent to be perfectly realized.\n\nMian Xuan, Zhui Wei, Yong Gan, and Qie Yi—these four roamed the world together, each fulfilling their aspirations. Though they spent their lives in one another’s company, they never exposed one another’s faults, for each believed their conduct to be without transgression.\n\nDuo Ou, Zi Zhuan, Cheng Quan, and Zhi Li—these four roamed the world together, each fulfilling their aspirations. Though they spent their lives in one another’s company, they never exchanged glances, for each believed the times to be perfectly suited to them.\n\nSuch are the manifold dispositions of the world. Though their appearances differ, all are ultimately gathered into the Dao—this is the decree to which they return.\n\n*Explication:*\nMo Xi and Shan Zhi represent the divergent temperaments of composure and trepidation. Tan Xuan and Bie Fu embody the contrasting demeanors of leisurely delay and hasty impulse. Qiao Ning and Yu Zhi differ as cunning flattery and blunt honesty. Nü Zhuo and Pian Pi vary as stubborn obstinacy and fawning compliance. Yu Ya and Qing Lu diverge in their excess and superficiality of emotion. Jian Ji and Ling Sui contrast in their reticence and eloquence. Mian Xuan and Zhui Wei differ in their preference for either clarity or complexity. Yong Gan and Qie Yi oppose bold resolve and timid hesitation. Duo Ou is one who echoes others; Zi Zhuan, one who trusts only himself. Cheng Quan exploits authority to dominate others; Zhi Li relies solely on his own strength without aid.\n\nEver since the Great Simplicity dissolved, the people have raced along the paths of right and wrong, profit and harm, their dispositions manifold and beyond enumeration. Liezi here summarizes twenty distinctions based on the inclinations to which their natures cling, the arts they transmit, the talents they employ, the conduct they display, and the times they encounter. Those of temperament believe their wisdom to be profound; those of art, their skill to be subtle; those of talent, their abilities to be perfectly realized; those of conduct, their actions to be without fault; those of timing, their circumstances to be perfectly suited. In their confusion, each affirms what they affirm and rejects what they reject, fulfilling their aspirations throughout their lives—so varied are the world’s dispositions.\n\nYet when one examines their origins, success and failure are equal in the realm of the living. Beauty and ugliness, goodness and foulness, all meet the same end. This is why they are moved by the Dao and converge in fate. Though all are gathered into the Dao, they do not comprehend it; though all return to fate, they do not trust it. Relying on private wisdom, clinging to partial views, they pursue only the interests of their small selves, forgetting the great impartiality of the world. In this, their resemblance to heaven and earth differs not from the mutual affinity of the one-legged Kui, the serpent, and the wind-eyed creature—what worth is there in being the most intelligent of the living?\n\nOnly those who embody the Dao and attain to fate achieve a mind congealed and a form released. When the mind congeals, there is no room within for cunning or affectation; when the form is released, there is no trace without of expression or countenance. These are the wellsprings of the world’s dispositions, yet those who transcend them wander carefree between heaven and earth, their hearts at ease. Looking down upon the world’s dispositions—is this not lamentable?\n\nThings that seem to succeed do so only by chance, not by true success. Things that seem to fail do so only by chance, not by true failure. Thus delusion arises from chance, and in the moment of chance, one is benighted. If, in the moment of chance, one is not benighted, then one is neither startled by external misfortune nor delighted by internal fortune. Moving with the times, halting with the times—even wisdom cannot fathom this.\n\n*Explication:*\nThe principles of the world are most subtle yet most luminous. Before signs appear, they are subtle; yet their principles are utterly clear. The worthy are blind to what has not yet sprouted; the common people are blind to what has already come to pass. If they are blind even to what has already occurred, how much more so to the incipient signs of success and failure? It is fitting that they remain benighted and know nothing of them.\n\nYet so-called chance success and chance failure are not truly chance at all—the principles of success and failure are silently determined before any form appears. Though it is said that delusion arises from chance, in truth, chance arises from delusion. Only those who cannot perceive the unformed signs of success and failure are bewildered in the moment of chance. Even in success, they dare not be certain of it, trembling lest it slip away; even in failure, they do not accept it as failure, hoping still for some gain. How, then, could they not be startled by external misfortune and delighted by internal fortune?\n\nIf one can remain unbewildered in the moment of chance, then success is simply success, and failure simply failure. Regarding fortune and misfortune as the alternation of day and night, the succession of cold and heat—seeing the outward, one knows the inward; observing the past, one knows the future. What room is there for joy or sorrow in between? Such a one has advanced beyond wisdom and aligned with the Dao. Even the great matters of life and death hold no change for them—how much less the mere beginnings of profit and harm?\n\nOne who trusts fate harbors no duality between self and other. Those who maintain such duality would do better to cover their eyes and plug their ears, turning their backs to cliffs and facing chasms—they would not fall. Thus it is said: life and death come from fate; poverty and hardship come from the times. Those who resent early death do not understand fate; those who resent poverty do not understand the times. Facing death without fear, enduring hardship without sorrow—these are those who understand fate and accept the times.\n\n*Explication:*\nWhen Shang Qiu Kai walked through water and fire, declaring that nothing could oppose him, his mind was unified—this illustrates how one who trusts fate harbors no duality between self and other.\n\nWithout trust in fate, one clings to the self, and with the self established, \"other\" and \"this\" arise. With \"other\" and \"this\" in place, likes and dislikes take form; as likes and dislikes intertwine, sorrow and joy alternate—though one may never have turned their back to cliffs or faced chasms, the fear of falling remains ever-present. Those who cover their eyes and plug their ears do not truly forget what they see and hear; yet with perception momentarily obstructed, even if they truly turned their backs to cliffs and faced chasms, they would not fall. This is how those who understand fate and accept the times face death without fear and endure hardship without sorrow.\n\nWhen the clever weigh profit and harm, assess emptiness and fullness, and gauge human sentiments, their gains and losses may still align with fate. When the foolish do not weigh profit and harm, do not assess emptiness and fullness, and do not gauge human sentiments, their gains and losses may also align with fate. What difference, then, lies between weighing and not weighing, assessing and not assessing, gauging and not gauging? Only when there is nothing to weigh and nothing not to weigh does one remain whole and free from loss. It is not that one knows wholeness or loss—one simply remains whole, loses, or perishes of their own accord.\n\n*Explication:*\nWeighing success and failure in profit and harm, assessing presence and absence in emptiness and fullness, gauging likes and dislikes in human sentiments—these are the ways of the clever. The unwise do the opposite. Yet the clever do not always succeed, nor do the foolish always fail. Thus, weighing or not weighing, assessing or not assessing, gauging or not gauging—none differ in outcome. Still, one cannot abandon cleverness because it does not always succeed, nor cling to foolishness because it does not always fail. Only when there is nothing to weigh and nothing not to weigh, when one employs wisdom without being enslaved by it and relies on wisdom without depending on it, do gain and loss both vanish. One remains perpetually whole, yet neither knows nor cares why this is so.\n\nDuke Jing of Qi wandered on Ox Mountain, gazing northward over his capital. Tears streamed down his face as he sighed: \"How beautiful is this land! So lush and verdant—how could I bear to leave it and die?\" If the ancients had never died, where would I go after departing this realm? His attendants, Shi Kong and Liang Qiu Ju, wept alongside him, saying: \"We rely on Your Lordship’s grace. Though we eat coarse grains and tough meat, ride broken-down horses and rickety carriages, we still do not wish to die—how much less Your Lordship?\" Only Yanzi laughed beside them. The duke wiped his tears and turned to Yanzi: \"Today’s outing has left me sorrowful. Kong and Ju wept with me—why do you alone laugh?\" Yanzi replied: \"If worthy rulers had always guarded this land, then the Great Duke and Duke Huan would still rule it. If brave rulers had always guarded it, then Duke Zhuang and Duke Ling would still rule it. Had these lords remained, where would Your Lordship be but standing in the fields in straw raincoat and hat, tending to affairs and fretting over death? How would you have come to occupy this throne? Since rulers have succeeded and departed one after another, and you alone weep for it, this is unkind. Seeing an unkind ruler and flattering ministers—these are the two things that made me laugh in secret.\" Duke Jing grew ashamed. He raised his cup to punish himself and forced his two ministers to drink two cups each as well.\n\n*Explication:*\nThe penalty of wine replenishes what is lacking in one’s qi. Duke Jing, gazing over his capital, admired its beauty and longed to preserve it forever, yet had no means to do so—his sorrow and tears knew no end. Upon hearing Yanzi’s words, he realized his cultivation was insufficient. Thus, he raised his cup to punish himself and forced his two ministers to drink two cups each. The double cups served to emphasize his inadequacy.\n\nThere was a man of Wei named Dongmen Wu whose son died, yet he felt no grief. His steward asked: \"No one in the world loved their child more than you. Now that your son has died, why do you not grieve?\" Dongmen Wu replied: \"I once had no son, and when I had no son, I felt no grief. Now that my son has died, it is the same as when I had no son—why should I grieve?\"\n\n*Explication:*\nAll who possess human form have human emotions; only the people of the great antiquity could forget them, while those of later ages could not match this. If one has not attained the forgetting of emotions yet remains indifferent and untroubled, they fall short of true emotion. How can one without emotion still be called human? Even Confucius, who engaged with the world, wept bitterly at the death of Yan Hui, asking, \"For whom else would I grieve if not for him?\" His inability to forget emotion was thus. Yet Dongmen Wu felt no grief at his son’s death—was he truly one who had forgotten emotion?\n\nFarmers rush to the seasons, merchants chase profit, artisans pursue skill, and the benevolent seek power—circumstances compel them. Yet farmers face droughts and floods, merchants encounter gains and losses, artisans meet success and failure, and officials experience favor and neglect—fate compels them.\n\n*Explication:*\nThis is the chapter \"Force and Fate.\" Liezi exhaustively demonstrates that all living things are governed by fate, yet he also warns against dismissing effort as futile and sinking into inaction. His purpose is to ensure that force and fate proceed together without losing their mysterious operation.\n\n*Force and Fate Explained*\nMencius called benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom \"fate,\" for they are rooted in human nature—thus the noble person does not call them fate. He regarded sensory pleasures as \"nature,\" for they are subject to fate—thus the noble person does not call them nature. What pertains to nature can be cultivated through human effort; what pertains to fate cannot be altered by heaven’s principle. Though some aspects of nature may be influenced by habit, human effort cannot be abandoned. Though heaven’s decrees depend on human action, heaven’s mandate cannot be entrusted entirely to fate. What fate governs may reside in nature; what nature possesses may be governed by fate. Nature and fate always proceed together; heaven and humanity constantly interact. Human lifespan, prosperity, rank, wealth, and poverty—all arise from this. Thus, Liezi composed the chapter \"Force and Fate.\"\n\nHaving examined the words of Liezi, one finds that while he places primacy on fate, he does not deny the efficacy of human effort in shaping things—yet neither does he wish to abandon all human endeavor and surrender entirely to fate. The essential point lies in not being burdened by matters of longevity or early death, nobility or lowliness, success or failure, wealth or poverty, for the power to shape fate resides within oneself.\n\nMoreover, when force is set against fate, it is simply the natural course of things. They depend upon one another and cannot exist without each other; viewed through the lens of the Dao, all is fate. Thus, what one desires to do is fate; what one does not do is also fate. What succeeds when pursued is fate; what fails when pursued is also fate. Whether one advances directly or yields to circumstance, matters of longevity or early death, success or failure, nobility or lowliness, wealth or poverty—all arise of themselves.\n\nSince these are said to arise of themselves, with no external force governing them, then even in matters of longevity or early death, who is there to augment or diminish? Even in matters of success or failure, what cause is there for joy or sorrow? Thus, one who understands fate accepts and receives these things as they come.\n\nConsider Confucius, whose sageliness was unmatched since the dawn of humankind—yet once bound by fate, he was twice exiled from Lu, had trees felled over him in Song, faced hardship in Shang and Zhou, and was besieged between Chen and Cai, ultimately serving not a single ruler. Though heaven had endowed him with near-sagely gifts, his teachings remained mere empty words, never realized in action—this may indeed be called fate. As for the Master, he cultivated himself, accepted success or failure as it came, recognized that comings and goings were not his to control, and stilled the turmoil of his heart and thoughts. His joy in heaven and understanding of fate were thus. Therefore, he found joy in adversity and joy in prosperity, yet what he rejoiced in was neither adversity nor prosperity.\n\nHowever, short of being a sage, none can truly comprehend the constraints of fate. Not only do they fail to understand, but they also persist in calculating what human effort has yet to achieve, rolling up their sleeves in defiance—how lamentable! Thus, Bao Shu initially treated Guan Zhong with generosity, yet Guan Zhong later slighted him; Xi Peng initially slighted Guan Zhong, yet Guan Zhong later treated him with generosity. Deng Xi opposed Zichan’s governance, yet Zichan adopted Deng Xi’s penal code; Zichan first employed his laws, and Deng Xi later met execution under them. Generosity arose from their own nature; slight arose from their own nature. The use of laws was unavoidable; the imposition of punishment was unavoidable. All was fate, not something within human power to control. Yet these men, in their time, claimed their actions as the work of their own wisdom and ability, failing to recognize the inherent principle of things. This is why the governance of Duke Huan and Duke Wen is deemed shameful in the Confucian school, and why Zichan’s benevolence is criticized by Confucius.\n\nConsider Ji Liang, who revered the divine physician—even matters of life and death could not sway him. Or Duke Jing of Qi, who wept upon seeing his capital’s walls—yet remained confused by the very thresholds of benefit and harm. All was fate, and the distinction between understanding and ignorance was thus. This is why Liezi could not escape debate.\n\nNevertheless, Beigongzi once felt shame for his disregard of fate when compared to Ximenzi, who achieved success through his endeavors. Yet upon awakening, he forgot both honor and disgrace, remaining at ease for the rest of his life. If this is so, then even one who disregards fate—can fate truly constrain him?\n\nLiezi’s intent was to clarify his own awakening in order to awaken those who had not yet understood, urging them to seek enlightenment. Though the central theme of his chapter dispels the confusion between force and fate, he ultimately concludes that force must not be abandoned and fate must not be ignored—this is the ultimate truth of fate. Thus, he concludes with the teachings on official service, farming, craftsmanship, and commerce as the workings of fate.\n\n*Explication of the Perfect Dao of Profound Virtue*, Scroll Fourteen—concluded.\n*Explication of the Perfect Dao of Profound Virtue*, Scroll Fifteen.\n\nSubmitted by Jiang Yu, an Inner Hall Student of Hangzhou Prefecture School in Song\n\n**Yang Zhu, Chapter One**\n\nYang Zhu traveled to Lu and lodged at the Meng residence. Meng asked him, “Man is but man—why then pursue fame?”\nYang Zhu replied, “Fame is sought for wealth.”\n“Once wealthy, why not cease?”\n“For nobility.”\n“Once noble, why not cease?”\n“For death.”\n“After death, what remains?”\n“For descendants.”\n“What benefit does fame bring to descendants?”\n“Fame is as one’s own body, straining the heart. Those who ride fame bring blessings to their clans, profit to their villages—how much more to their descendants? Yet all who pursue fame cultivate frugality, and frugality leads to poverty. Those who pursue fame must yield, and yielding leads to lowliness.”\n\nMeng said, “When Guan Zhong served as minister of Qi, the lord indulged, and so did he; the lord was extravagant, and so was he. Their wills aligned, their words followed, and the Way was enacted—Qi became a hegemon. Yet after his death, only the Guan clan remained. When the Tian clan served Qi, if the lord was full, they diminished themselves; if the lord taxed, they gave. The people all turned to them, and thus they came to possess Qi. Their descendants have enjoyed it to this day without end. If true fame impoverishes, then false fame enriches.”\n\nYang Zhu said, “Truth has no fame, and fame has no truth. Fame is but pretense. Long ago, Yao and Shun feigned yielding the world to Xu You and Shan Juan yet did not lose it, reigning for a hundred years. Boyi and Shuqi truly yielded the rulership of Guzhu, yet their state perished, and they starved on Mount Shouyang. The distinction between truth and pretense is thus made clear.”\n\n*Explication*:\nThe constant Dao has no name; names arise only after things are formed and their numbers fixed. The wise detest the chaos of affairs and things, and so, out of necessity, they impose names upon them. Names are not natural—all within the realm of the nameable is but pretense. Yet though names issue trust, they must rely on reality; reality does not manifest itself and must borrow names. The noble-minded do not resent following names to tread reality; they resent only clinging to names and burdening reality.\n\nThe careless multitude, unaware that their bodies do not truly belong to them, pursue wealth and nobility in life. Unaware that their descendants do not belong to them, they compete for empty fame after death. At first, they seek reality through fame; in the end, they seek fame to the detriment of reality. If reality is not fame, then why did Guan’s extravagance bring no benefit to his descendants? If fame is not reality, how did Tian’s generosity lead to their possession of Qi? Names cannot be discarded, nor can they be pursued. Pursuing names destroys reality; amassing reality establishes names.\n\nMoreover, if one pursues the present, then Boyi and Shuqi’s yielding is not as good as Yao and Shun’s pretense. If one cares for posterity, then Guan Zhong’s extravagance is not as good as the Tian clan’s generosity. To seek both fame and reality—how is this possible?\n\nLiezi did not value worldly wealth and nobility, nor was he unaware that Yao, Shun, Boyi, and Shuqi did not seek fame yet gained it, becoming objects of universal praise for later ages. Even the sage’s engagement with the world, daily entanglement in affairs, inevitably produces names—all within the realm of judgment. Liezi spoke thus to urge scholars to devote themselves to the nameless Dao.\n\nIf one feigns benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and teaching to steal the world’s empty fame, not only will they fail to gain fame, but they will lose even the profit they might have had—far worse than thieves who at least indulge their desires in life. This is perhaps an overcorrection, a necessary exaggeration.\n\nYang Zhu said, “A hundred years is the utmost span of life. Among a thousand, not one attains it. Even if one does, half is spent in infancy, dotage, and old age. Half of what remains is lost to sleep at night and distraction by day. Half of what is left is consumed by pain, illness, sorrow, loss, worry, and fear. In the few years that remain, moments of ease and self-contentment, free from care, are rare indeed. For what, then, does man live? For what joy? For fine food and abundance. For music and beauty. Yet fine food cannot always satisfy, nor can music and beauty always be enjoyed. Then one is bound by rewards and punishments, advanced or restrained by fame and law. Restlessly, one competes for fleeting reputation, schemes for posthumous glory, anxiously obeys the sights and sounds of the senses, and clings to the judgments of body and mind. The supreme joy of the present is lost, and one cannot indulge even for a moment. How is this different from a prisoner in heavy shackles?”\n\n*Explication*:\nA hundred years of life are worn down by cares. Yin and yang assail from without; desires gnaw from within. Nothing is strong or enduring—all becomes illness and vexation. At night, the spirit labors in sleep; by day, the body toils in wakefulness. How can one not harbor fleeting anxieties even for a moment? Yet these anxieties, when held, bring worry and fear; when released, bring ease and joy. Holding or releasing them lies within oneself. Why, then, do people so often tread the path of care? Do they willingly embrace suffering? No—it is because they take fine food and beauty as joy that they compete for reputation, scheme for glory, guard their senses, and cling to judgments. Anxious and restless, they are bound by rewards and punishments, advanced or restrained by fame and law, daily mired in care without self-awareness.\n\nThus, in a hundred years of life, one fails both to attain the inner joy of heaven and to indulge even for a moment—both are lost. How is this different from a prisoner in heavy shackles? Zhuangzi also called this a long illness, a prolonged affliction from which one does not die. Did Liezi truly wish for the people to indulge in the pleasures of music and beauty?\n\nIndeed, those who scramble in vain for hollow reputations bring no benefit to themselves—far better to cast off restraint and pursue the joys rightful to life. Yet is this not itself a corrective overreach?\n\nThe people of the great antiquity knew life as a fleeting arrival and death as a fleeting departure. Thus they followed their hearts in action, never resisting what nature inclined them to love. The pleasures of the present body were not to be forsaken, so they were not swayed by the lure of fame. They roamed in accord with their nature, never opposing what the myriad things inclined them to love. Posthumous renown was not to be sought, so they were not touched by the reach of punishment. Fame and infamy, long life and short—these were not matters for their reckoning.\n\nThe *Explanation* says: Death and life are but a going and a returning. The people of great antiquity, their great simplicity yet undispersed, their primal integrity uncarved by human artifice, could trace things back to their origin and return to their end, thus knowing the discourse on death and life. Thereby they followed their hearts in action and roamed in accord with their nature, going nowhere without a sense of ease and self-possession.\n\nNature is to the heart as substance is to function. To depart from nature and then follow the heart is to act in accord with the heart, thus never resisting what nature inclines one to love. To roam in accord with one’s nature is then to never oppose what the myriad things incline them to love. Moreover, action may be constrained, but roaming is ever fitting. Following the heart in action, one does not forsake the pleasures of the present body—this is not to seek the good of near-term fame, so one is not swayed by fame. Roaming in accord with one’s nature, one does not scheme for posthumous renown—this is not to seek the evil of near-term punishment, so one is not touched by punishment. Those who are thus do not see the changes of life and death as anything more than the constant alternation of night and day. How then would they have leisure to calculate the precedence of fame and infamy or measure the length of life and span of years?\n\nYang Zhu said: What distinguishes the myriad things is life; what they share is death. In life there are the worthy and the foolish, the noble and the base—this is what distinguishes them. In death there is putrefaction and dissolution—this is what they share. Yet the worthy and the foolish, the noble and the base are not within one’s power; putrefaction and dissolution are likewise not within one’s power. Thus life is not what one lives, death is not what one dies, worthiness is not what one makes worthy, foolishness is not what one makes foolish, nobility is not what one makes noble, baseness is not what one makes base. Yet the myriad things are equally born, equally die, equally worthy, equally foolish, equally noble, equally base. Whether one dies at ten or a hundred, whether one is a sage or a tyrant, a fool or a brute—all alike become rotting bones. Rotting bones are one and the same: who knows their distinctions? Why then hasten to the present life and trouble oneself over what comes after death?\n\nThe *Explanation* says: Life and death alternate, originally without sameness or difference. Petty wisdom, self-serving in its smallness, falsely sees difference within sameness, then posits sameness on the basis of difference—thus the sameness and difference of life and death become confused and indistinguishable. Yang Zhu sought to equalize the changes of life and death and make them one. Thus, taking the common view that sees life as different and death as the same, he ultimately returns to a state beyond sameness and difference. If one were to abruptly speak to them of the ultimate unity of the Way, they would be thrown into confusion amid their doubts, and their delusions would remain unresolved. This is the sage’s constant skill in saving people.\n\nMoreover, in equalizing the changes of the myriad things, one must speak of Yao and Shun, Jie and Zhou—only by dispelling the world’s deepest delusions can one properly use the extremes of the mad and the sage, those whom all under heaven and all generations trust. To say that Yao and Shun are the same as Jie and Zhou is no idle claim. The traces of Yao and Shun’s response to the world, their adaptation to the times and compliance with change, could not avoid some degree of attachment—how then could their traces fail to converge in rotting bones? As for what made Yao and Shun truly Yao and Shun, this is what Confucius called “so vast that the people could find no name for it”—how could this be the same as the rotting bones of Jie and Zhou?\n\nYang Zhu said: Boyi did not lack desires—his pride in purity led him to starve to death. Zhan Zi did not lack passions—his pride in integrity led him to leave his lineage diminished. The errors of purity and integrity are thus manifest in goodness itself.\n\nThe *Explanation* says: In human life, passions give rise to desires, and desires give rise to love. If desires are not moderated, they overflow into cravings, nurturing likes and dislikes, and the natural endowment of life and destiny becomes diseased—this is how goodness itself becomes error. If what one prides oneself on is purity and integrity, then one can restrain one’s passions and moderate one’s desires—how then is this an error of goodness? Yet Boyi and Zhan Zi, though they bore the names of purity and integrity, harbored the intention to correct excess and remedy flaws, so their traces could not avoid some degree of attachment—thus they too were enslaved by passions and desires. To the point of starving to death or leaving one’s lineage diminished—is it not fitting to call this an error of goodness? Thus the sage follows the course of the mean as his constant principle and does not go to extremes.\n\nYang Zhu said: Yuan Xian was impoverished in Lu; Zigong amassed wealth in Wei. Yuan Xian’s poverty harmed his life; Zigong’s wealth burdened his person. If poverty is not permissible and wealth is not permissible, where then lies the permissible? It lies in delighting in life and in freeing the body. Thus one who is good at delighting in life is not impoverished; one who is good at freeing the body is not wealthy.\n\nThe *Explanation* says: In human life, one must rely on things for sustenance—plowing to eat and weaving to clothe oneself are unavoidable. Even the people of great antiquity were no exception, save that they did not cast their gaze left and right to snare profit amid riches and honor, nor did they allow officials to monopolize the fields. The former path avoids poverty—this is how one delights in life. The latter path avoids wealth—this is how one frees the body. For one who is impoverished wears a hempen cap and straw sandals, leaning on a staff of brambles—how can one speak of delighting in life? For one who is wealthy is weighed down by cares and anxieties, ever seeking more—how can one speak of freeing the body? From this one knows that the Way of Liezi does not go to extremes and has never been wholly unmindful of the peace or peril of the world’s course.\n\nYang Zhu said: There is an ancient saying: \"In life, we cherish one another; in death, we abandon one another.\" This saying reaches the utmost truth. The way of cherishing in life is not merely about affection; it is through diligence that one attains ease, through hunger that one finds satiety, through cold that one knows warmth, through poverty that one achieves success. The way of abandonment in death is not that one feels no sorrow; it is that no pearls or jades are placed within, no patterned brocades are worn, no sacrificial animals are offered, and no funerary objects are set out.\n\nThe commentary states: The establishment of later kings and lords to govern the people of the world is meant to ensure they do not neglect their duties—this is the way of cherishing in life. But when it comes to death, all is simplified; even good friends do no more than sigh in eternal lament—this is the way of abandonment.\n\nYan Pingzhong asked Guan Yiwu about nurturing life. Guan Yiwu replied: \"Let it be, without obstruction or restraint.\" Yan Pingzhong asked: \"What does this entail?\" Yiwu said: \"Indulge the ears in what they wish to hear, the eyes in what they wish to see, the nose in what it wishes to smell, the mouth in what it wishes to speak, the body in what it wishes to rest, and the mind in what it wishes to do. If the ears desire to hear sounds but are not allowed to listen, this is called stifling hearing. If the eyes desire to see beauty but are not allowed to look, this is called stifling sight. If the nose desires the scent of pepper and orchid but is not allowed to smell, this is called stifling scent. If the mouth desires to speak of right and wrong but is not allowed to speak, this is called stifling wisdom. If the body desires comfort but is not allowed to follow it, this is called stifling ease. If the mind desires to act freely but is not allowed to do so, this is called stifling nature. All these stiflings are the tyrants of oppression. To cast off these oppressive tyrants and await death in joyful ease—whether for a day, a month, a year, or ten years—this is what I call nurturing life. To be bound by these oppressive tyrants, clinging to them without release, and living in sorrow for a long life—whether a hundred years, a thousand years, or ten thousand years—this is not what I call nurturing life.\"\n\nThe commentary states: When Master Liezi studied under Old Shangzi, after three years, his heart dared not contemplate right and wrong, and his mouth dared not speak of profit and harm. Thus, in what his mouth wished to speak and his mind wished to do, he could not indulge freely. For this reason, Old Shangzi first relaxed his countenance and smiled upon seeing him. After nine years, whatever his heart contemplated and whatever his mouth spoke, he could indulge and act freely without obstruction or restraint. Thus, Old Shangzi acknowledged his progress in both inner and outer cultivation. The so-called indulgence of the ears in hearing, the eyes in seeing, the nose in smelling, and the body in resting is like this—it does not mean indulging in sounds, sights, scents, and tastes to violate what human principles abhor, and only then is it called indulgence. One who can advance in this way has truly heard the Dao. \"To hear the Dao in the morning, one may die in the evening.\" Thus, even a life of a day or a month is sufficient for nurturing, so why cling to a long life in sorrow? This is Liezi’s ultimate principle of nurturing life. What Guan Zhong, Yanzi, and Zeng Xi did not do—how could they have advanced in this Dao?\n\nYan Pingzhong’s pork shoulder never filled his plate—he was one who practiced frugality in person. Guan Yiwu had three returning cups and a wine stand—he was one who loved luxury. Yan Pingzhong’s question and Guan Yiwu’s answer were naturally as they were. Their exchange was like the principle of fruits and melons; their words happened to align with the Dao. Thus, Liezi adopted their sayings to convey the ultimate Dao, not intending for scholars to emulate what Guan and Yan did.\n\nGuan Yiwu said: \"I have already told you about nurturing life. What of sending off the dead?\" Yan Pingzhong replied: \"Sending off the dead is a matter of simplicity. What more is there to say?\" Guan Yiwu said: \"I still wish to hear of it.\" Pingzhong said: \"Once dead, what is it to me? Burning is acceptable, sinking is acceptable, burying is acceptable, exposing is acceptable, wrapping in firewood and casting into a ravine is acceptable, or adorning with embroidered robes and placing in a stone outer coffin is acceptable—whatever one encounters.\"\n\nGuan Yiwu turned to Bao Shu and Huangzi and said: \"The way of sending off the dead—we two have advanced in it.\"\n\nThe commentary states: For one who has attained the Dao, sending off the dead means taking heaven and earth as the coffin and outer coffin, the sun and moon as paired jades, the stars as pearls and ornaments, and the myriad things as offerings. In this, what encounter could not be fitting?\n\n*Explication of the Perfect Virtue of the Vacuous and Unwavering Classic, Scroll Fifteen, concludes.*\n*Explication of the Perfect Virtue of the Vacuous and Unwavering Classic, Scroll Sixteen.*\n\nThe memorial submitted by Jiang Yu, an inner student of the Hangzhou Prefecture Academy of Song:\n\nDuring Yang Zhu’s era, Zichan governed Zheng, monopolizing the state’s administration. After three years, the virtuous admired his transformation, the wicked feared his prohibitions, Zheng was well-ordered, and the feudal lords stood in awe. Yet he had an elder brother named Gongsun Chao and a younger brother named Gongsun Mu. Chao was fond of wine, and Mu was fond of women.\n\nIn Chao’s residence, a thousand *zhong* of wine were amassed, fermented dregs piled into mounds. From a hundred paces beyond the gate, the stench of lees and swill assailed the nostrils. When he was lost in drink, he knew nothing of the world’s peace or peril, the regrets and humiliations of human affairs, the prosperity or ruin of his household, the closeness or estrangement of his nine clans, or the sorrow and joy of life and death. Even if water and fire, blades and weapons clashed before him, he remained oblivious.\n\nMu’s rear courtyard held dozens of chambers, each filled with young, supple beauties. When he was immersed in sensuality, he cast aside close kin, severed friendships, and fled to the inner quarters, sating himself day and night. He emerged but once every three months, yet still felt unsatisfied. If a maiden of surpassing beauty dwelled in the village, he would bribe and summon her, employ matchmakers to entice her, and only desist if he failed to obtain her.\n\nZichan grieved over this day and night. Secretly, he sought Deng Xi’s counsel, saying: “I have heard that governing the self leads to governing the household, and governing the household leads to governing the state—this speaks of proceeding from the near to the far. I have brought order to the state, yet my household is in chaos. Is my Way perverse? What method can save these two?” Deng Xi replied: “I have long found this strange but dared not speak first. Why not admonish them in due time, enlightening them on the weight of life and destiny, enticing them with the dignity of ritual and righteousness?”\n\nZichan heeded Deng Xi’s words. Seizing an opportunity, he visited his brothers and said: “What elevates humans above beasts is wisdom. What wisdom guides is ritual and righteousness. When ritual and righteousness are perfected, fame and rank follow. If you act on impulse, indulging your desires, your life and destiny will be imperiled. Heed my words, and by evening, Chao will repent and receive emolument.”\n\nChao and Mu replied: “We have long known this and long deliberated upon it. Do we need your words to recognize it? Life is hard to encounter, death easy to reach. With a life so difficult to attain, awaiting a death so easily come—how can one not ponder this? To exalt ritual and righteousness to impress others, to feign nature and temperament for fame—we deem this worse than death. We wish to exhaust a lifetime’s joy, to plumb the year’s utmost pleasure. Our only fear is a belly too full to drink to our heart’s content, strength too spent to indulge our passions. We have no leisure to fret over foul reputations or perilous lives.”\n\n“Moreover, you boast of your governance to sway others, seeking to confuse our hearts with fine words, to delight our minds with honor and emolument—is this not base and pitiable? We wish to part ways with you. Those who excel at governing the external may not bring order to things, yet their persons suffer. Those who excel at governing the internal may not bring chaos to things, yet their natures find ease. Your governance of the external may be temporarily enforced in one state, but it does not accord with human hearts. Our governance of the internal can be extended to all under heaven, and the Way of ruler and minister will cease. We have long wished to instruct you in this art, yet you turn and teach us yours instead.”\n\nZichan was left speechless. Later, he recounted this to Deng Xi, who said: “You have dwelled with true persons yet do not recognize them. Who calls you wise? Zheng’s order is but a coincidence, not your achievement.”\n\n*Explication states:* Indulging passion in sensuality is what deludes and enthralls human sentiment, what human principles deem most shameful. Gluttonous drinking is what all human sentiment desires, what the former kings warned against. The common person’s sentiment craves the sight of beauty. When denied to the point of blindness, it is not that they truly suppress desire, but that they fear peril to life and are restrained from indulgence. The mouth craves fine flavors. When denied to the point of satiation, it is not that they truly forget preferences, but that they shun foul reputations and are deterred from indulgence.\n\nThus, exalting ritual and righteousness, feigning nature and temperament, may appear outwardly as if one can be serene and effortless. Yet in their seated reverie, their thoughts race in an instant beyond the four seas, their aspirations and intentions reaching everywhere, accomplishing anything. If so, a hundred years of life will inwardly torment their hearts and minds, outwardly afflict their forms and bodies. Where is the joy in such life?\n\nAs for Chao and Mu’s conduct, it is simply genuine. Their so-called gluttonous drinking is not drowning in wine. Their so-called indulgence in sensuality is not wallowing in lust. For Chao and Mu have long understood the peace and peril of the world’s ways, the gains and losses of human principles, and long deliberated upon them. Desiring to exhaust a lifetime’s joy, to plumb the year’s utmost pleasure, they drink to their heart’s content and indulge their passions. Though their reputations may be foul, they do not fret over perilous lives, nor do they spare a thought for it. This is what is called governing the internal without governing the external, having no shame before the Dao and virtue, daring to act on perverse impulses without adhering to the conduct of benevolence and righteousness.\n\nTheir genuine Way of governing the self, if extended and practiced, could bring the world to effortless order. Yet Zichan busies himself ferrying people across the Zhen and Wei rivers, his governance inevitably criticized by the people and humbled by Deng Xi. This is what is called excelling at governing the external—things may not be ordered, yet the person suffers. Though his methods may be temporarily enforced in one state, they do not accord with human hearts. How could he understand the genuineness of these two?\n\nTo fail to comprehend this is one thing, yet to further confuse the mind with clever words, to let honor and disgrace sway the will—such sincerity is contemptible, and such intent pitiable. Ruling Zheng in this manner and monopolizing its governance, even if the virtuous submit to its transformation and the wicked fear its prohibitions, they remain ignorant of the true principles of order. Any success is merely accidental—how can it be called achievement? In the court of Mu, Zichan stood between the ranks of Ji and Meng, yet his conduct and aspirations were unequal, and his governance of internal and external affairs diverged so starkly. Thus it is said: if the Way could be conveyed to others, none would fail to share it with their brothers.\n\nAs for Deng Xi, initially he had not yet examined the Way of the court of Mu, so upon hearing Zichan’s words, he shared his sorrow. Later, having grasped the Way of the court of Mu, he heard Zichan’s words and diverged in understanding. Alas! Without Deng Xi’s words, later observers of the court of Mu would nearly all share Zichan’s sorrow and never perceive the truth.\n\nWei’s Duanmu Shu was a descendant of Zigong, who inherited his family’s wealth, amassing tens of thousands in gold. Unconcerned with worldly affairs, he indulged his every inclination. Whatever the people desired to do or fancied to enjoy, he did and enjoyed without restraint. His mansions, terraces, gardens, ponds, feasts, carriages, robes, music, and concubines rivaled those of the lords of Qi and Chu. Whatever his heart desired, his ears wished to hear, his eyes wished to see, or his mouth wished to taste—even if it came from distant lands or remote states, beyond what Qi’s soil could produce—he procured it all as readily as if it were within his own walls. In his travels, though mountains and rivers blocked the way, the paths were long and the distances vast, he ventured without hesitation, as easily as taking a single step. Daily, hundreds of guests filled his halls, his kitchens never ceased their smoke and flame, and his halls and corridors never stilled their music.\n\nFrom the surplus of his provisions, he first distributed to his clansmen; what remained, he gave to his village; and what still remained, he scattered throughout the state. At sixty, his vitality waning, he abandoned his household affairs and dispersed his storehouses of treasures, carriages, robes, and concubines. Within a year, all was gone, leaving no wealth for his descendants. When he fell ill, he had no medicines stored; when he died, no resources for burial. The people of the state who had received his bounty gathered to contribute, returning his wealth to his descendants.\n\nQin Guli heard of this and said: \"Duanmu Shu is a madman, a disgrace to his ancestors.\" Duangan Sheng heard of it and said: \"Duanmu Shu is an enlightened man, his virtue surpassing his ancestors.\" What he did and how he lived startled the common mind, yet the truth of principle affirmed it. Many of Wei’s gentlemen clung to ritual and teaching, yet this was hardly sufficient to grasp the heart of such a man.\n\nA Commentary states:\n\nZigong was a man burdened by his mercantile pursuits. While amassing wealth, he hoarded it without daring to spend, clinging to it without release. His heart was filled with anxiety and distress, ever seeking more without cease—truly a life of sorrow. With Zigong’s riches, he could have lived out his days in grand estates, fine robes, rich flavors, and fair companions, lacking nothing. Yet his endless pursuit of gain arose from scheming for his descendants’ endless future. Alas! Grandchildren are not your possessions; to claim and hold them as such is delusion. Moreover, he tormented his body, forwent sweetness, and denied his own sustenance, only to be cast aside by the sages for his mercantile ways. In striving to suit his own desires, was this not a great tragedy?\n\nAs for Duanmu Shu: inheriting his family’s wealth, he never knew the toil of commerce yet bore the weight of ten thousand gold. Having it, he knew how to use it. Thus, he indulged his every inclination, doing all he wished and delighting in all he fancied. In ease and contentment, his aspirations fulfilled, he rivaled the lords of Qi and Chu. Not only did he know how to use wealth, but as his vital qi neared its decline, he scattered and exhausted all he had. By common judgment, he was most unkind to his descendants’ legacy. Yet later, those who received his bounty returned his wealth to his descendants—so he was not without bequest after all.\n\nAlas! Duanmu Shu lived free from the burden of commerce, exhausting a lifetime of joy. In death, he left no wealth for his descendants yet did not lose it for them. His conduct and deeds startled the common mind, yet the truth of principle affirmed them. Where truth resides, only the sage can fully grasp it. Those bound by teaching cannot but be astonished by such spirit.\n\nBetween madness and sagacity lies a gulf—how could it be less than heaven and earth? To call the enlightened mad is great confusion indeed.\n\nYangzi declared the great sage to be difficult to comprehend—was this not the reason? Meng Sunyang asked Yangzi: \"Suppose there is a man here who values life and cherishes his body, seeking not to die—would this be acceptable?\" Yangzi replied: \"In principle, there is no not-dying.\" \"Then seeking long life—would this be acceptable?\" \"In principle, there is no long life. Life is not preserved by valuing it, nor is the body enriched by cherishing it. Moreover, what is the purpose of long life? The five passions of love and hate were the same in ancient times as now; the safety and peril of the four limbs were the same in ancient times as now; the bitterness and joy of worldly affairs were the same in ancient times as now; the alternations of order and chaos were the same in ancient times as now. Having heard of these, having seen them, having experienced them, one finds even a hundred years wearisome in their excess—how much more the suffering of long life!\"\n\nMeng Sunyang said: \"If this is so, then swift death is preferable to long life. Thus, treading upon blades, plunging into boiling water—one would attain one’s desire.\" Yangzi replied: \"Not so. Once born, one should relinquish and entrust it, exhausting one’s desires while awaiting death. When death approaches, one should relinquish and entrust it, exhausting one’s course to its fullest end. There is nothing not relinquished, nothing not entrusted—why hastily distinguish between swift and slow?\"\n\nExplanation: Confined by having life, life does not struggle against form, yet form must ultimately decay. Enslaved by transformation, transformation constantly flows through form—how can form endure? Thus, a hundred years is the greatest span of longevity, yet among a thousand, not one attains it. In principle, one may not achieve long life—how much less immortality? Examining life’s existence and cessation, it does not originally belong to me. Observing life’s cares and troubles, one clings to long life. While one has life, within your form, the five passions’ loves and hates churn within; within your body, the four limbs’ safety and peril press without. In a single lifetime, the myriad affairs’ bitterness and joy converge before you. The changes of a day are no different from those of a month; the shifts of a year are no different from those of a hundred. Having heard and known them, having seen and recognized them, having experienced and passed through them—how can one still seek long life?\n\nYet though death and life are but morning and evening, why rejoice in life? Why grieve over death? One should not, because life is insufficient cause for joy, weary of long life; nor should one, because death is insufficient cause for sorrow, delight in swift death. Thus, those who attain the Dao regard life and death: once born, they relinquish and entrust it, exhausting their desires while awaiting death, not binding themselves to the ditches’ self-strangulation. When death approaches, they relinquish and entrust it, exhausting their course to its fullest end, not clinging to the longevity of exhaling the old and inhaling the new. Though they have no intention of long life, if they attain the longevity of Peng, they do not weary of it. Though they have no intention of swift death, if they meet the early demise of Yan, they follow transformation. Nothing is not relinquished, nothing is not entrusted—thus it is, and no more.\n\nYang Zhu said: \"Bo Cheng Zigao did not use a single hair’s benefit for others. He abandoned his state and retired to plow in seclusion. Great Yu did not use his own body for self-benefit, leaving one part of his body withered. The ancients would not sacrifice a single hair to benefit the world, nor would they take the whole world to serve a single body. If each person does not sacrifice a single hair, and each person does not benefit the world, the world will be well-ordered.\"\n\nExplanation: In the *Yi*, diminishing the lower to enrich the upper is called \"diminishing\"; diminishing the upper to enrich the lower is called \"enriching.\" Enrichment must entail diminishment, and diminishment must ultimately lead to enrichment. Diminishment and enrichment are the principles of fullness and emptiness, growth and decline. As for the generation of the myriad things, all equally embody the supreme principle, without deficiency or excess. Add a single hair, and nature has no room for excess; remove a single hair, and nature has no surplus. Thus, to enrich is to diminish, and to diminish is to enrich—both miss the mark. What could be more chaotic than calling this \"order\"? Only one who does not employ diminishment or enrichment attains the way of mutual benefit for self and others.\n\n*Zhuangzi* speaks of the time from Rong Cheng to the era of Shen Nong, when the people savored their food, admired their clothing, delighted in their customs, and rested content in their dwellings, living to old age without visiting one another—this could be called each person not sacrificing a single hair, each person not benefiting the world. In such a time, perfect order prevailed.\n\nQinzi asked Yang Zhu: \"Would you pluck a single hair from your body to save the world?\" Yangzi replied: \"The world is certainly not saved by a single hair.\" Qinzi said: \"Suppose it could be saved—would you do it?\" Yangzi did not respond. Qinzi went out and told Meng Sunyang, who said: \"You do not understand the Master’s heart. Allow me to explain. If someone could gain ten thousand gold by harming your skin, would you do it?\" \"I would.\" Meng Sunyang said: \"If someone could gain a state by severing one of your joints, would you do it?\" Qinzi fell silent for a while. Meng Sunyang said: \"A single hair is finer than skin, and skin is finer than a joint—this is evident. Yet it is by accumulating hairs that skin is formed, and by accumulating skin that joints are formed. A single hair is but one ten-thousandth of the body—how can you regard it as light?\" Qinzi said: \"I cannot answer you. However, if you asked Lao Dan and Guan Yin with your words, your words would be correct; if I asked Yu or Mo Di with my words, my words would be correct.\" Meng Sunyang then turned and discussed other matters with his disciples.\n\nExplanation: Those who speak of Yangzi claim his way is centered on self-interest, thus even if it meant plucking a single hair from his body to save the world, he would not do it. Yet *Liezi* records his words differently. Yangzi’s meaning was this: the greatness of the world cannot be saved by a single hair. Since a single hair is insufficient to save the world, why speak of a hypothetical salvation?\n\nQinzi’s question was likewise ill-considered, and so Yangzi did not respond. Yangzi’s intent was this: though a single hair and the skin differ in magnitude, the skin is but an accumulation of hairs, and since both are parts of my body, both are equally worthy of love—why then value a joint over a single hair? If one could lead every person to honor life and cherish its root without slighting even a single hair, the world would be more than well-governed.\n\nYangzi’s love for a single hair was not love for the hair itself, but love for his own body. All people love their bodies yet fail to cherish even a single hair; if they do not cherish a single hair, the neglect accumulates until they harm their very bodies without realizing it. They approve of loving the body but disapprove of loving a single hair—how thoughtless this is!\n\nI have observed that in human life, the noble rule the base, the low serve the exalted, and all spend their days toiling, laboring for things external, never reserving even the slightest for themselves. Have they never considered whether their lives exist for themselves or for others? If their lives are truly their own, why do they not act for themselves? And if they exist for others, yet cannot even govern themselves, how can they govern others?\n\n*Liezi* deeply despised those who chase after the ten thousand things without turning back, and so his book often attributes to Yangzi the doctrine of self-interest. Qinzi never grasped Yangzi’s meaning; instead, he claimed that if his words were put to Yu or Mo Di, they would be correct. But this merely shows he saw the traces of Yu and Mo Di, for he understood neither Yangzi nor Yu and Mo Di. Meng Sunyang then turned away and discussed other matters with his disciples, for Qinzi’s words were not of the same kind.\n\nYang Zhu said: The world’s praise is heaped upon Shun, Yu, the Zhou kings, and Confucius, while its blame falls upon Jie and Zhou. Yet Shun tilled the fields at Heyang and made pottery at Leize, his limbs never knowing rest, his mouth and belly never tasting fine fare. His parents did not love him, his siblings did not befriend him. At thirty, he married without informing them. When he received Yao’s abdication, he was already old, his wisdom in decline. When Shangjun proved unworthy, he abdicated to Yu, living in sorrow until his death—such was the bitter end of this man revered as a sage. Gun failed in his governance of flood and earth, and was executed at Feather Mountain. Yu inherited his work and avenged his father, laboring endlessly over barren lands. He had no time to raise his son, passed his own door without entering, his body withered, his hands and feet calloused. When he received Shun’s abdication, he humbled his palaces and adorned his robes and crowns, living in sorrow until his death—such was the toil of this man revered as a sage. After King Wu’s death, King Cheng was young and weak, and the Duke of Zhou took up the regency. The Duke of Shao was displeased, and the four states spread rumors. The Duke of Zhou lived in the east for three years, executed his brother, and exiled another, barely escaping with his life, living in sorrow until his death—such was the peril of this man revered as a sage. Confucius expounded the Way of the sage-kings and responded to the summons of rulers of his time. He was driven to fell a tree in Song, erased his traces in Wei, impoverished in Shang and Zhou, besieged in Chen and Cai, humiliated by the Ji family, insulted by Yang Hu, living in sorrow until his death—such was the harried life of this man revered as a sage.\n\nAll four of these sages lived without a single day of joy, yet died with names revered for ten thousand generations. But a name is not something one can truly possess. Though praised, they knew it not; though rewarded, they knew it not—no different from a clod of earth or a block of wood.\n\nJie inherited the resources of generations, sitting upon the throne of the Son of Heaven. His wisdom was sufficient to overawe his ministers, his might enough to shake the realm. He indulged his ears and eyes in every pleasure, exhausted his thoughts in every desire, living in bliss until his death—such was the wanton ease of this man reviled as a tyrant. Zhou too inherited the resources of generations, sitting upon the throne of the Son of Heaven. His power knew no bounds, his will no resistance. He gave free rein to his passions in the Leaning Palace, indulged his desires through long nights...\n\nThey did not torment themselves with ritual and righteousness, yet blissfully met their execution—such were the reckless among heaven’s people. Those two fiends enjoyed the pleasures of desire in life, but in death bore the name of folly and brutality. For reality is not something a name can confer; though reviled, they knew it not; though praised, they knew it not—how did they differ from a clod of earth or a block of wood?\n\nThose four sages, though the fairest of all, toiled to the end of their days, yet all alike met death. Those two fiends, though the foulest of all, reveled to the end of theirs, yet all alike met death.\n\nExplanation: Shun was the most illustrious of emperors, Yu the foremost of kings, the Duke of Zhou the paragon of loyalty and sagacity, and Confucius the brightest expositor of the Dao—all were the highest exemplars of sagehood, revered and cherished by all under heaven for ten thousand generations. Yet Shun’s bitter hardships, Yu’s cares and toils, the Duke of Zhou’s fears and trepidations, and Confucius’ haste and distress—when examined against the records of the Yu, Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties, and weighed against Confucius’ own words, the truth of their suffering is beyond doubt. To say they lived in constant sorrow until death is no exaggeration.\n\nAs for Jie and Zhou, their wanton ease and reckless indulgence, their unbridled delight in the pleasures of ear and eye, their exhaustive pursuit of every desire, their unrestrained passions in the Leaning Palace, their unchecked desires through long nights—this may indeed be called blissful fulfillment of every wish. All under heaven ascribe beauty to Shun, Yu, the Duke of Zhou, and Confucius, calling them the Four Sages; all under heaven ascribe evil to Jie and Zhou, calling them the Two Fiends. The Four Sages bore the empty name of ten thousand generations, while the Two Fiends enjoyed the real benefits of their own lifetimes. For reality is not something a name can confer, nor is a name something reality can claim. In the end, what we call praise or blame is merely passed down through the ages. How can those who praise or blame know the truth of what came before? And how can those who are praised or blamed know what comes after? Though there be praise or blame, how does it differ from a clod of earth or a block of wood? Is it not fitting, then, to say that beauty and evil alike meet the same end in death?\n\nLiezi speaks thus not to urge the world to abandon the names of the Four Sages and pursue the reality of the Two Fiends, but to make seekers of the Dao discern that both name and reality are equally illusory, and to recognize that sorrow and joy are equal burdens. Thus, he uses the common judgments of all under heaven for ten thousand generations to show that one should forsake the traces of the sages and seek the Dao of the sages. Moreover, the Four Sages, content with heaven and knowing fate, were never truly troubled. What we call their hardships, cares, and fears were but unavoidable responses to the world, sharing in the fortunes and misfortunes of the people, and grieving the people’s sorrows. The name of sagehood and wisdom was bestowed upon them by others, and they did not refuse it. Only by understanding this can one grasp the meaning of Liezi’s words, for he walks the same Dao as the Four Sages.\n\n*Explication of the Perfect Virtue of the Vacuous and Unwobbling Classic*, Scroll Sixteen—Concluded\n*Explication of the Perfect Virtue of the Vacuous and Unwobbling Classic*, Scroll Seventeen\n\n**Submitted by Jiang Yu, an Inner Student of Hangzhou Prefecture School in Song**\n\n**Yang Zhu, Part Two**\n\nYang Zhu met with King Hui of Liang and said, \"Governing the world is as easy as turning one’s palm.\" The king replied, \"You cannot even govern one wife and one concubine, nor tend to a garden of three *mu*—how can you claim that governing the world is as easy as turning one’s palm?\"\n\nYang Zhu answered, \"Have you not seen a shepherd? A hundred sheep in a flock, led by a five-foot boy carrying a switch, will go east when he wishes and west when he wishes. But if Yao were to lead a single sheep while Shun followed with the switch, they could not move forward. Moreover, I have heard: a fish that can swallow a boat does not swim in shallow streams; the great swan soars high and does not alight in filthy ponds. Why? Because its reach is vast. The deep tones of *huangzhong* and *dalü* cannot accompany frivolous dances. Why? Because their resonance is too distant. Thus, those who govern the great do not govern the petty; those who achieve great deeds do not fuss over small ones. This is what I mean.\"\n\n*Explication:* Only when one understands what it means to govern as easily as turning one’s palm can one truly speak of governance. Yangzi said, \"The world is vast, yet its governance lies in the Dao; the Four Seas are distant, yet their governance lies in the heart.\" If one truly believes these words, then the Dao exists even without descending to the level of one’s belt—how much more effortless than turning one’s palm! If one can embody this Dao, then one may act without action, and the people will govern themselves; one may love stillness, and the people will correct themselves. Thus, by not governing, one governs. But if one insists on governing through governance, then even one wife and one concubine will overwhelm one’s capacity, and a garden of three *mu* will exhaust one’s strength—this is like Yao leading the sheep while Shun follows with the switch. Therefore, it is said: those who govern the great do not govern the petty; those who achieve great deeds do not fuss over small ones.\n\nYang Zhu said, \"The affairs of the distant past have vanished—who records them? The deeds of the Three Sovereigns exist as if they exist not; the affairs of the Five Emperors seem like waking dreams; the undertakings of the Three Kings appear now hidden, now revealed—of a hundred, not one is known. Even the events of one’s own lifetime are sometimes heard, sometimes seen—of ten thousand, not one is known. The matters before one’s eyes may endure or fade—of a thousand, not one is known. From the distant past to the present, the years are too numerous to count. Yet since Fuxi’s time, over three hundred thousand years have passed, and all distinctions of worth and folly, beauty and ugliness, success and failure, right and wrong have dissolved—only the swiftness or slowness of their passing remains. To pride oneself on fleeting praise or blame, to exhaust one’s spirit and body in pursuit of a name that may linger a few hundred years after death—how can this moisten dry bones? Where is the joy in life?\"\n\n*Explication:* Whatever can be spoken or done is nothing but affairs. If one does not depart from the realm of words and deeds, one cannot escape the workings of time and fate. Even the governance of the distant past involved affairs; the Way of the Sovereigns, the virtue of the Emperors, the achievements of the Kings—with each descending age, affairs grow more entangled. Judging by what the ears and eyes perceive, the knowledge of one may be double, fivefold, tenfold, a hundredfold, or even a thousandfold that of another. Extending this upward to the Yellow Emperor, some events exist as if they exist not, some seem like waking dreams, some appear or vanish—of a hundred, not one is known. As for the distant past, all is already lost—who records it? Thus, the traces of good and evil alike are all abandoned. If one believes goodness is to be pursued, then the name of goodness will also fade in time; if one believes evil is to be avoided, then the sound of evil will also vanish in time—only the swiftness or slowness of their passing remains. How can one be so deluded as to race endlessly after such fleeting distinctions?\n\nYet the affairs of the Sovereigns, Emperors, and Kings in responding to the world did not depart from the realm of the nameable—were they truly right? Were they truly wrong? The traces of emperors and kings arose from stimulus and response, compelled to act, without intent for fame, yet others attributed names to them. This differs from those who pride themselves on praise or blame to seek renown. Thus, though their worldly affairs passed with the times, what made them sages endures eternally. If it were not so, why would the governance of sages be esteemed?\n\nYang Zhu said, \"Humans resemble the category of Heaven and Earth, possessing the nature of the Five Constants. Among beings, the most intelligent are humans. Yet humans lack claws and teeth sufficient for defense, skin tough enough for protection, speed enough to flee harm, or fur and feathers to shield against cold and heat. They must rely on external things for sustenance, depending on wisdom rather than strength. Thus, what wisdom values is preserving the self; what strength devalues is encroaching upon others. Yet the body does not belong to oneself—once born, one cannot but preserve it; things do not belong to oneself—once obtained, one cannot but part with them. The body is the master of life, just as things are the master of sustenance. Though one preserves life, one cannot possess the body; though one does not discard things, one cannot possess them. To possess things or the body is to wrongly claim private ownership of the world’s body and the world’s things—only the sage does not do this. To regard the world’s body and the world’s things as public—only the perfected person does this. This is what is called the utmost of the utmost.\"\n\n*Explication:* In life, one must rely on things for sustenance—this is the foundation of nurturing life, the principle of safeguarding life, the truth of fulfilling life, and cannot be avoided. The body is the master of life, so to live, one must first not separate from form; things are the master of sustenance, so to nourish form, one must first rely on things. Yet there are those with surplus things who do not nourish their form, so though one does not discard things, one cannot possess them. There are those whose form remains intact yet whose life perishes, so though one preserves life, one cannot possess the body. People of the world do not know how to nourish form—how can they truly preserve life? To wrongly claim private ownership of the world’s body as one’s own, to wrongly claim private ownership of the world’s things for sustenance—this is to pursue what life has no use for.\"\n\nIf the body remains intact yet the principle of life perishes, what is there in the world worth pursuing? Only the sage, perhaps, can abandon affairs and relinquish life’s concerns to attain wholeness of form and restoration of essence. Yet even the sage is but a harbinger of transformation, unable to forget the self. As for the perfected one who never strays from the true—such a one makes the world’s body public, so the body is no different from things; makes the world’s things public, so things are none other than the self. This is what *Zhuangzi*’s \"Attaining Life\" calls \"essence refined to the utmost,\" and what may be termed the ultimate of the ultimate.\n\nYang Zhu said: The people’s inability to rest stems from four causes—first, for longevity; second, for fame; third, for rank; fourth, for wealth. With these four, one fears ghosts, fears others, fears authority, fears punishment—this is what is called the fugitive. Life and death are determined by external forces. If one does not defy fate, why covet longevity? If one does not prize nobility, why covet fame? If one does not seek power, why covet rank? If one does not crave riches, why covet wealth? This is what is called the compliant. The world has no counterpart; fate is mastered from within.\n\nExplanation: At the beginning of life, all possess the way to longevity, and those who attain their constant nature live long. Holding fast to the everlasting and loving virtue, fame then follows, rank is achieved, and wealth becomes abundant—this is the sequence of the four. Human longevity naturally ranges from those above like Peng Zu to those below like the Five Hegemons of Yu. How can people’s greed for life ever cease? As for the martyr who dies for fame or the miser who dies for wealth—before obtaining, they fret over gain; after obtaining, they fret over loss. Their minds are tormented, their bodies labored, their lives spent in haste—when do they know a moment’s peace? Of the four, people can seldom possess them all. Even if one attains one, though they toil their whole lives, it is never enough to satisfy their desires. How much less can they satisfy their insatiable cravings if they pursue all four? This is why the people cannot rest.\n\nWith these four, one advances in pursuit and retreats in avoidance. In the unseen, they fear ghosts. In society, they feign emotions to avoid others’ reproach. Authority need not be wielded against them, yet they tremble in dread of its reach. Punishment need not be set for them, yet they quiver in fear of transgression. In the slightest movement, their frail selves are controlled by things, and the true master within is lost—this is what is called the fugitive. Little do they know that equalizing the changes of life and death allows one to forget longevity and brevity; discerning the wealth of contentment makes wealth and possessions unnecessary to pursue. Without carriages and robes to bind them, blades and saws do not touch them. Indifferent to order and chaos, they know neither demotion nor promotion. With nothing to covet within, they have nothing to fear without. Dwelling between heaven and earth, they move alone, enter alone, come alone, go alone—the world has no counterpart. This is called \"possessing alone.\" One who possesses alone is called the most noble.\n\nThus the saying goes: If one neither marries nor enters office, half of human desires are lost. If one neither eats nor wears clothes, the way of ruler and subject ceases. Explanation: Hunger drives one to eat, cold drives one to wear clothes—those with life cannot escape desire. With desire unfulfilled, strife arises, and the distinction between ruler and subject is thereby clarified. All people must eat and wear clothes, but not all marry or enter office. Marriage brings many troubles of human relations; office stirs the heart of envy. Is this not the root of the people’s inability to rest? One who neither marries nor enters office, though not entirely free of desires, is far removed from the common folk.\n\nAs for the cessation of the way of ruler and subject—this means both ruler and subject are at ease, neither knowing who serves whom nor seeking favor or praise. Thus the duty between ruler and subject cannot be abolished, but its way may cease. A Zhou proverb says: \"A farmer can be killed by sitting.\" Rising at dawn and returning at dusk, he takes this as the constant of his nature; sipping beans and chewing greens, he takes this as the height of flavor.\n\nA body with coarse, thick flesh and sinews knotted in tension, suddenly placed beneath soft silk curtains and fed with fine grains, meats, orchids, and citrus—such a heart grows fevered, the frame restless, and illness brews within. Should the lords of Shang and Lu share the toil of a field laborer, they would not endure even a single season before exhaustion. Thus, what the rustic finds at ease, what he deems most excellent, he calls unmatched under heaven.\n\n**Explanation:** All are human, yet if a field laborer were to receive the provisions of a ruler, he would fall ill; if the lords of Shang and Lu were to share the labor of a field hand, they would be spent. To abandon fine grains and follow a diet of greens is indeed difficult for human nature; to exchange greens for fine grains seems easy. Yet one cannot readily exchange the ease of the field laborer, for habit reshapes a person and cannot be swiftly altered. How much more so for those drowned in external things, content with vulgar learning—how can one expect them to change their habits and find rest in the supreme Dao? Surely those who have not pondered this deem it distant.\n\nLong ago in Song, there was a field laborer who wore only coarse hemp to survive the winter. When spring came and he tilled the eastern fields, he basked in the sun, unaware of the world’s grand halls, sheltered chambers, silk floss, or fox-fur robes. Turning to his wife, he said: *\"The warmth of the sun’s embrace is known to none. If I offered it to our lord, he would surely reward me richly.\"* A wealthy villager told him: *\"Once, a man praised the fine taste of wild beans, sweet spring celery, and duckweed seeds to the village elders. The elders tasted them, only to find their mouths stung and their bellies pained. The crowd laughed and reviled him, and the man was deeply ashamed. You are of the same kind.\"*\n\n**Explanation:** One who wears coarse hemp knows nothing of the warmth of grand halls, sheltered chambers, silk floss, or fox-fur robes; one who praises wild beans, sweet spring celery, and duckweed knows nothing of the richness of fine grains. Cloaked in comfort, they remain unaware of the Dao’s way of clothing all things; seduced by worldly flavors, they fail to know the Dao’s blandness, which is flavorless—so it is with these men.\n\nYang Zhu said: *\"Grand houses, fine clothes, rich flavors, and beautiful women—with these four, what more could one seek? Yet those who possess them and still seek more are of insatiable nature. Such insatiability is the worm that gnaws at yin and yang.\"*\n\n**Explanation:** Grand houses, fine clothes, rich flavors, and beautiful women are all things beyond one’s proper share. To pursue them relentlessly is to be of insatiable nature. Why must one seek beyond these to be deemed insatiable? Mencius considered the eyes’ colors, the ears’ sounds, the nose’s scents, and the limbs’ ease as human nature. The teachings of Liezi sought harmony with nature and contentment in simplicity, despising those who distort their true feelings to chase empty fame. Thus, to possess these four and still seek more is to be the worm that gnaws at yin and yang. Moreover, to speak of having these four is to imply wealth and sufficiency. If one must seek them to possess them, what greater insatiability could there be?\n\nLoyalty is insufficient to secure a ruler’s peace and only endangers the self; righteousness is insufficient to benefit others and only harms one’s life. Peace for superiors does not come from loyalty, and so the name of loyalty fades; benefiting others does not come from righteousness, and so the name of righteousness perishes. When ruler and subject are both at ease, when self and others both profit—this was the Way of antiquity.\n\n**Explanation:** Loyalty dares to confront the ruler’s displeasure; righteousness is resolute in shaping things. Loyalty may overreach in self-discipline, and others will turn against it; righteousness may err in severity, and the unworthy will respond with malice. But to serve a ruler with the Dao is to bear a fine name oneself while the ruler enjoys renown—is this not ruler and subject both at ease? To respond to things with the Dao is to remain without action oneself while the people transform naturally—is this not self and others both profiting? Laozi said: *\"When the great Dao declines, there is benevolence and righteousness; when the state is in chaos, there are loyal ministers.\"* This is the same idea.\n\nMaster Yu said: *\"Abandon fame, and there is no sorrow.\"* Laozi said: *\"Fame is the guest of reality.\"* Yet the careless pursue fame without end. If fame cannot be abandoned, can it not at least be treated as a guest? Now, to have fame is to enjoy honor; to lack fame is to suffer disgrace. Honor brings ease and pleasure; disgrace brings worry and hardship. Worry and hardship violate one’s nature; ease and pleasure accord with it. These are tied to reality. How can fame be abandoned? How can it be treated as a guest? The danger lies in clinging to fame and burdening reality. Clinging to fame and burdening reality will lead to irreparable peril—how could it be merely a matter of ease and pleasure or worry and hardship?\n\n**Explanation:** Master Yu’s abandonment of fame does not mean its absence but its non-attachment. Laozi’s treating fame as a guest does not mean its removal but its non-mastery. Since life exists, so does the self; since the self exists, so do burdens. Where things and self interact, every affair involves fame, and every fame involves reality. Joy and suffering in one’s nature are tied to fame—how could fame be entirely eradicated? The careless, enamored of empty fame, pursue it endlessly and thus lose their grasp on reality. Those who covet the name of benevolence may go so far as to kill themselves; those who covet the name of righteousness may go so far as to destroy their kin. Jie Zitui died for loyalty; Weisheng died for trust—both clung to fame and burdened reality, courting irreparable peril.\n\nThis chapter of Liezi repeatedly expounds the principle of fame and reality. Yet lest scholars mistakenly believe the Dao seeks to eradicate all fame under heaven, it further clarifies: the danger lies in clinging to fame and burdening reality. If one can avoid clinging to fame and burdening reality, this is Master Yu’s abandonment of fame, Zhuangzi’s treating fame as a guest, and the sage’s so-called namelessness. In this lies the fullness of the Way of conducting oneself and responding to things.\n\n**Yang Zhu’s Explanation:** Master Liezi’s classic elucidates the essentials of the great Dao, transmitting the orthodox lineage of the Yellow Emperor, Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Kings Wen and Wu, the Duke of Zhou, and Confucius.\n\nYang’s doctrine of \"for me\" is a heretical teaching that deludes the people, corroding the Way of the sages more grievously than any other. Thus, later scholars of the sages took the ability to refute Yang and Mo as the mark of a true disciple of the sages. Yet observe how Liezi takes the name *Yu-kou* (Master Yu)—this too signifies his self-assumed duty to safeguard the Way of the former sages. His book repeatedly cites the words of Yang and Mo as instruction, even equating Confucius with Mozi as those whom the world wishes to bring peace and benefit. Here, he further offers the teachings of *Yang Zhu* as a separate chapter. Does the author of *Liezi* truly regard Yang Zhu’s Way as unopposed to the sages and thus fit to instruct the world? Or does he recognize it as a doctrine that obstructs benevolence and righteousness—why then would he adopt its words?\n\nThe intent of *Liezi* may be inferred. Yang’s \"for me\" is a lament for those in the world who, chasing external things, lose themselves, unaware of what abides within. In life, they pursue longevity, fame, rank, and wealth—none of which truly benefit the self. Even in death, they still seek blessings for their descendants. Yet descendants are but the cast-off husks of heaven and earth—what have they to do with me? Thus, men cautiously weigh what they see and hear, cling to right and wrong, are restrained by rewards and punishments, and advance or retreat by the measures of fame and law. Restless and anxious, they spend their lives no different from prisoners in heavy shackles, never awakening to the fact that creation brought me into being for *myself* alone. My life ought to be lived for me, ensuring that the self is not lost—why then torment body and mind to seek what others seek, to suit what others suit, and in doing so, lose what is truly mine?\n\nFrom this, we know that *Liezi* does not wish the world to embrace Yang’s heretical doctrine. Rather, he desires that men not be enslaved by external things, that they know only to preserve the self. If one can avoid losing the self, then governing a state or ordering the world becomes but the overflow of one’s surplus—how magnificent would that be!\n\nNevertheless, Master Liezi’s instruction is subtle. His book clarifies that all beings arise from utmost emptiness, taking *zong-cang-gu* (the storehouse of the ancestral) as its principle, equating all paths to the lost sheep. Thus, he takes the most extreme of Yang Zhu’s heretical teachings, merges them with the Way of the sages, and presents them as one discourse, hoping that scholars will not follow the traces of the sages but seek their minds instead. Therefore, every passage that invokes Yang Zhu’s words conveys nothing but the essence of the supreme Way, even going so far as to equate the Four Sages and the Two Villains as sharing the same ultimate end.\n\nLater readers, upon reaching this point, may well doubt that *Liezi* considers Yao and Shun as truly outside the Way, or that he genuinely aligns with Yang’s heresy. This is the fault of reading the text without grasping its circumstances. Little do they realize that this very chapter is where *Liezi* exerts his utmost effort, forming a continuous thread with Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Kings Wen and Wu, the Duke of Zhou, and Confucius. Confucius said: *\"Is it only the* Spring and Autumn Annals *that understands me? Is it only the* Spring and Autumn Annals *that condemns me?\"* The chapter *Yang Zhu* in *Liezi* is of the same nature.\n\n*Commentary on the* True Classic of Perfect Virtue *concludes, Volume Seventeen.*\n*Commentary on the* True Classic of Perfect Virtue *begins, Volume Eighteen.*\n\nMinister Jiang Yu, an Inner Student of the Hangzhou Prefecture Academy of Song, respectfully presents:\n\n*Explaining the Symbols, First Fascicle*\n\nMaster Liezi studied under Master Huqiu Zilin. Master Huqiu Zilin said: \"If you understand how to hold to what comes after, then we may speak of how to hold to the self.\" Liezi said: \"I wish to hear about holding to what comes after.\" He replied: \"Observe your shadow, and you will know.\"\n\nLiezi turned and beheld his shadow: when his form bent, the shadow curved; when his form straightened, the shadow aligned. Thus, crookedness and straightness follow the form and do not reside in the shadow; bending and extending depend on things and not on me. This is called \"holding to what comes after and thereby abiding in what comes first.\"\n\n*Explanation:* The *Explaining the Symbols* elucidates the sage’s response to the world. The sage’s response to the world arises only after being moved, acts only under compulsion, and rises only when there is no alternative. Taking things as the form and oneself as the shadow, the shadow always follows the form in its crookedness or straightness, just as I always yield to things in bending or extending. When they come, I come with them; when they go, I go with them. What once moved now halts; what once sat now rises. Others all seize what comes first, while I alone take what comes after, as though lacking any fixed principle. Yet by not contending with things, none in the world can contend with me—this is how one abides in what comes first.\n\nMaster Liezi’s teacher was Master Huqiu Zilin. Once, when his disciples paid their respects, he asked: \"What did Master Hu say?\" Here, he recounts Master Hu’s teaching on holding to what comes after. In the *Heavenly Signs*, the sage’s Way proceeds from Heaven to man, hence it is said to be wordless. In the *Explaining the Symbols*, the sage’s Way proceeds from man to Heaven, hence it cannot avoid being spoken. At first, wordlessness proceeding to Heaven is the sage’s original heart; in the end, speech proceeding to man is the sage’s unavoidable necessity.\n\nMoreover, Liezi’s Way of life arises from knowledge and self-attainment—why would he need to study? Yet to leave instruction for all ages and become the teacher of ten thousand generations, he must, from beginning to end, employ the Way of master and disciple in his discourse. This is akin to Confucius, who did not claim sageliness for himself but said, \"I love antiquity and am earnest in seeking it.\"\n\nGuanyin said to Master Liezi: \"Beautiful words produce a beautiful echo; ugly words produce an ugly echo. A tall body casts a long shadow; a short body casts a short shadow. Name is the echo; body is the shadow.\" Thus he said: \"Be cautious in your words, for they will be answered; be cautious in your conduct, for it will be followed.\"\n\n*Explanation:* The *Book of Changes* says: \"Words and actions are the hinge and spring of the noble person. The release of the hinge and spring determines honor or disgrace. Words and actions are how the noble person moves Heaven and Earth—thus the noble person is cautious of them.\" Therefore, the sage sees the outward and knows the inward, observes the past and knows the future—this is the principle by which he attains foreknowledge.\n\n*Explanation:* Outward and inward, past and future—these are one mechanism. People are often blind to the subtlest illumination and only recognize outward and inward, past and future when things have taken shape and their patterns are fixed. Who can see the outward and know the inward, observe the past and know the future? Only the sage who, from the root source, discerns the portents of transformation.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* says: \"The inchworm bends to seek extension. The dragon and snake store their power to preserve themselves.\" The measure lies in oneself; the verification lies in others. If others love me, I must love them; if others hate me, I must hate them. Tang and Wu loved all under Heaven, thus they reigned as kings; Jie and Zhou hated all under Heaven, thus they perished—this is what is verified. When verification and measure are both clear yet not acted upon, it is like leaving without using the door or walking without following the path. Seeking profit thus—is it not difficult?\n\nI have observed that the Divine Farmer possessed the virtue of blazing clarity. Verifying it against the books of Yu, Xia, Shang, and Zhou, and measuring it by the words of exemplary scholars and worthies, I find that those who preserved or ruined, abolished or established, yet did not proceed by this Way—there have been none.\n\n*Explanation:* Before the Great Primal separated, the ten thousand images were a chaotic whole. After the Two Modes divided, each thing found its place. Not even a hair’s breadth could be disordered; not even one or two could be misaligned. Sound moves and echo responds; form arises and shadow follows. What lies in me can be measured; what lies in others can be verified. Following Yao and Shun, the imperial enterprise can be traced; following Tang and Wu, the kingly achievement can be inherited. The Divine Farmer possessed the virtue of blazing clarity—he attained this alone. The books of Yu, Xia, Shang, and Zhou record this alone. The words of exemplary scholars and worthies debate this alone. Even the most sagely of persons, subtle and profoundly penetrating, unfathomably deep—when they emerge to respond to things, there has never been one who did not govern by this Way.\n\nMencius, who claimed to understand words, said: \"If the sages were to arise again, they would surely follow my words.\" His discourse on the Way of the former sages also said: \"If the sages were to arise again, they would not alter my words.\" Regarding the sages who had not yet appeared, he predicted what they would surely do, for they would not go beyond verification and measure.\n\nAs for the saying, \"If others love me, I must love them; if others hate me, I must hate them\"—the sage does not love or hate others based on their love or hatred of him. Rather, if others love me, it must be because I have something worthy of their love; if others hate me, it must be because I have something worthy of their hatred.\n\nYan Hui said: \"Those who ask about the Way do so for the sake of wealth. Now that I have obtained the pearl, I am wealthy—why would I need the Way?\" Master Liezi said: \"Jie and Zhou valued profit and slighted the Way, thus they perished. Fortunately, I have not yet spoken to you of this. A person without righteousness, who eats and nothing more, is like a chicken or dog. Those who forcibly seize food and lock horns, with the stronger prevailing—these are beasts. To be like chickens, dogs, or beasts, yet desire others to honor oneself—this cannot be. If others do not honor oneself, then danger and disgrace will befall one.\"\n\n*Explanation:* Zhuangzi once used the \"mysterious pearl\" to illustrate the Yellow Emperor’s Way.\n\nThe pearl, as an object, is perfectly round and luminous—it is the ultimate treasure. Its roundness allows nothing to obstruct it, and its clarity reflects all things without exception. Thus, obtaining the pearl serves as a metaphor for the wealth of the Way. Only those who attain the Way possess all things in abundance, which is what Zhuangzi called \"wealth beyond measure.\" To value profit as wealth leads only to peril and disgrace.\n\nLiezi had mastered archery and sought instruction from Master Guanyin. The master asked: \"Do you know why you hit the mark?\" Liezi replied: \"I do not.\" Guanyin said: \"Then you are not ready.\" Liezi withdrew and practiced for three years before returning to report. Guanyin asked again: \"Do you now know why you hit the mark?\" Liezi answered: \"I do.\" Guanyin said: \"Now it is acceptable. Hold fast to this and do not lose it. This principle applies not only to archery but to governing a state and cultivating oneself.\" Thus, the sage does not examine whether things endure or perish but investigates the reasons behind them.\n\n*Explanation:* An archer who hits the target without prior intent cannot be called a skilled archer, for he does not understand why he succeeded. Once he grasps the reason, his success lies within himself, and even the skill of Gan Ying or Fei Wei becomes attainable. Governing a state and cultivating oneself follow the same principle. By discerning the causes of survival and ruin, one can wield the Way to navigate the times, ensuring enduring existence. If the nature of survival and ruin has already manifested, even scrutiny will be of no avail.\n\nLiezi said: \"Those whose vitality is abundant grow arrogant, and those whose strength is abundant grow reckless—such people cannot be spoken to of the Way. Thus, one does not discuss the Way with the young and vigorous, let alone practice it.\"\n\n*Explanation:* Those whose vitality is abundant grow arrogant, and those whose strength is in full bloom are in their prime—a time when external things assail them and their virtue naturally declines. How could they be spoken to of the Way? By the time their hair turns gray, their desires soften and their bodies begin to rest, making them fit to hear of the Way and practice it. Yet this speaks only of those who are subject to the great transformations of nature. There are also those who follow the great transformations without being swept along by them, who never lose the heart of an infant. Though strong, they are not arrogant; though aged, they do not decline. In speaking of the Way, they are never at a loss.\n\nThus, those who act recklessly will find no one to guide them. Without guidance, they become isolated and lack support. The wise entrust matters to others, so even in old age they do not decline, and even when their wisdom is exhausted, they do not fall into chaos.\n\nTherefore, the difficulty in governing a state lies in recognizing the worthy, not in considering oneself wise.\n\n*Explanation:* Those who do not take on tasks but exhaust their strength in labor will not decline with age. Those who do not hoard wisdom but employ the counsel of the wise will not fall into chaos when their own wisdom is spent. Even with the intelligence of Yao and Shun, Yao worried over not obtaining Shun, and Shun worried over not obtaining Yu and Gaoyao. The difficulty of governing a state lies solely in this—how can one rely on the conduct of self-proclaimed wisdom?\n\nA man of Song crafted a mulberry leaf out of jade for his lord, taking three years to complete it. Its edges, veins, and fine details were so lifelike that when mixed with real mulberry leaves, it could not be distinguished. As a result, this man lived off his craft in the state of Song.\n\nWhen Liezi heard of this, he said: \"If heaven and earth took three years to produce a single leaf, few things would have leaves at all.\" Thus, the sage relies on the transformative power of the Way, not on cleverness or skill.\n\n*Explanation:* Carving jade into a mulberry leaf so indistinguishable from real leaves demonstrates how human skill can rival the workings of creation. Yet the jade carver took three years to complete one leaf, while the transformations of nature—with yang qi circulating subtly through heaven and earth—bring forth the flourishing and withering of all things, shaping countless forms without being called clever. Even the skill of the Song artisan only secured his livelihood in one state—how much less for those whose skill does not match his? Thus, the sage relies on the transformative power of the Way, not on cleverness or skill.\n\nLiezi was impoverished, his appearance bearing the marks of hunger. A visitor mentioned this to Ziyang, the ruler of Zheng, saying: \"Lie Yukou is a man of the Way. That he lives in your state in such poverty—does this not suggest you do not value scholars?\" Ziyang immediately ordered an official to send grain to Liezi. Liezi went out to meet the messenger, bowed twice, and declined the gift. The messenger departed.\n\nWhen Liezi returned home, his wife gazed at him and, striking her breast, said: \"I have heard that the wives and children of those who possess the Way all enjoy ease and happiness. Yet you bear the marks of hunger. The ruler passed by and sent you food, but you refused it—is this not fate?\"\n\nLiezi laughed and replied: \"The ruler does not know me personally. He sent me grain only because of another’s words, and if he were to punish me, it would also be on account of another’s words. This is why I did not accept it.\" Later, the people indeed rose in rebellion and killed Ziyang.\n\n**Explanation:** The sage is never careless in accepting or refusing. If something does not accord with the Way, he would rather die than accept it—how much less would he do so for the sake of his wife’s offerings? By navigating the world in this manner, he avoided disaster.\n\nThe Lu family of the Shi clan had two sons. One loved learning, the other loved warfare. The one who loved learning offered his arts to the Marquis of Qi, who accepted him and made him tutor to the noble scions. The one who loved warfare went to Chu and presented his methods to the King of Chu, who was pleased and appointed him military commander. Their salaries enriched their household, and their ranks honored their kin.\n\nThe neighboring Meng family had two sons as well, who pursued the same studies, yet suffered from poverty. Envying the Shi family’s prosperity, they sought advice on how to advance. The two Shi sons truthfully told them what they had done.\n\nOne of the Meng sons went to Qin and offered his arts to the King of Qin. The king said: \"Nowadays, the feudal lords contend with force, and all they concern themselves with are soldiers and provisions. If I were to govern my state with benevolence and righteousness, it would be the path to ruin.\" He then castrated the man and banished him.\n\nThe other Meng son went to Wei and presented his methods to the Marquis of Wei. The marquis said: \"I rule a weak state, hemmed in between great powers. I serve the great states and soothe the small ones—this is the way to seek security. If I were to rely on military power, destruction would soon follow. If I let you return unharmed, you would go to another state and become a grave threat to me.\" He then had the man’s feet cut off and sent him back to Lu.\n\nUpon their return, the Meng father and sons beat their breasts and reproached the Shi family. The Shi father said: \"Those who seize the moment prosper; those who miss it perish. Your path was the same as ours, yet your results differ—this is because you missed the moment, not because your conduct was flawed. Moreover, in the world, principles have no constant right, and affairs no constant wrong. What was once used may now be discarded; what is now discarded may later be used. This matter of use and disuse has no fixed right or wrong. Seizing opportunities and adapting to circumstances—this depends on wisdom. If wisdom is insufficient, even if one were as learned as Confucius or as skilled as Lü Shang, where could one go and not meet with failure?\"\n\nThe Meng father and sons relaxed their expressions, free of resentment, and said: \"We understand. Say no more.\"\n\n**Explanation:** The Guo clan of Qi and the Xiang clan of Song differed in wealth, for the Xiang clan did not grasp the Guo clan’s way. Beigongzi and Ximenzi met with different fortunes in their undertakings, for their virtue and fate may have differed in depth. As for the Shi and Meng families of Lu, their pursuits were the same—unlike the Guo and Xiang clans, who followed different paths, or Beigongzi and Ximenzi, whose virtue and fate may have differed. Qi inherited the customs of the Grand Duke and continued with the governance of Guan and Yan; Wei was enfeoffed by Kangshu and Duke Wu, who maintained its administration, so Wei abounded in noble men. Thus, the states of Qi and Wei concerned themselves only with benevolence and righteousness. Chu, dwelling among the barbarians, had King Wu who once wished to display his worn armor to observe the governance of the Central States, and King Zhuang who reviewed his troops at the Luo suburbs to inquire about the Zhou tripods. From Duke Xiao of Qin onward, Qin devoured the six states. The kings of Qin and Chu concerned themselves only with soldiers and provisions. The Shi family applied the methods the Meng family had used in Wei to Chu, and presented the techniques the Meng family had used in Qin to Qi, so they met with success everywhere. Had the Meng family likewise applied the methods used in Wei to Qin and the techniques used in Qin to Wei, they would have achieved the same results as the Shi family. Why did they reverse their methods? Thus, the Shi family attributed their failure to a lack of timely wisdom, and the Meng family, too, released their resentment.\n\nThe virtue of governing with benevolence and righteousness is profound, so those who offended were punished severely. The art of military power in a strong state is shallow, so the punishment stopped at amputation. Nevertheless, seizing opportunities and adapting to circumstances depend on wisdom. Yet in the world, there are matters beyond the reach of wisdom—thus, the differing fortunes of the two families were also a matter of fate. Yet when Liezi recounted their words, it was because the *Shuofu* does not depart from the scrutiny of forms and names. If one were to attribute all success and failure to fate, scholars would drift toward the inaction of clods and dust, which is not the Way. Therefore, in this case, he did not dismiss the wisdom of seizing the moment.\n\nDuke Wen of Jin went out to a meeting, intending to attack Wei. Gongzi Chu looked up to the sky and laughed. The duke asked why he laughed. He replied: \"I laugh at a neighbor who was escorting his wife to her parents’ home. Along the way, he saw a woman picking mulberry leaves, was pleased, and spoke with her. Yet when he glanced back at his wife, someone was beckoning to her as well. I secretly laughed at this.\"\n\nThe duke understood his meaning and called off the attack. He turned the army back, but before they arrived, someone had already raided their northern border.\n\n**Explanation:** People’s thoughts are not far apart. What I desire, others desire; what I know, others know. To pursue one’s own ambitions without considering others’ feelings is delusion.\n\nThe state of Jin suffered from bandits. There was a man named Xi Yong who could recognize bandits by their appearance, discerning their intentions from their eyebrows and eyelashes. The Marquis of Jin sent him to identify bandits, and he did not miss a single one among hundreds. The marquis was overjoyed and told Zhao Wenzi: \"I have found one man, and all the bandits in the state are as good as gone. Why would I need more?\"\n\nWenzi said: \"Relying on spies and scrutiny to catch bandits, Your Lordship will never eradicate them. Moreover, Xi Yong will not meet a good end.\"\n\nSoon after, the bandits plotted among themselves: \"The one who has us cornered is Xi Yong.\" They then joined forces to ambush and kill him.\n\nWhen the Marquis of Jin heard this, he was greatly alarmed. He immediately summoned Wenzi and told him: \"Just as you predicted, Xi Yong is dead. But what method should we use to capture the bandits?\"\n\nWenzi replied: \"There is a saying in the Zhou proverbs: 'He who sees the fish in the abyss brings misfortune; he who predicts hidden things invites calamity.' If Your Lordship wishes to eliminate bandits, nothing is better than elevating the worthy and entrusting them with governance, so that instruction is clear above and transformation flows below. When the people possess a sense of shame, what need is there for bandits?\"\n\nThereupon, the marquis appointed Sui Hui to administer the government, and the bandits fled to Qin.\n\n**Explanation:** Those who rely on spies and scrutiny catch bandits only after the crime is committed, while those who clarify instruction and transformation prevent banditry before it arises. Once a man has become a bandit, where is the virtue in that? Thus, Xi Yong’s scrutiny of bandits led to his untimely death. But when transformation is enacted and the people come to know shame, as when Sui Hui was entrusted with governance, the bandits fled to Qin. Yet driving bandits away only to have them flee to Qin is like those who control floods by making a neighboring state their drainage ditch.\n\nTo govern the world by the Dao is to have the people dwell without knowing what they do, move without knowing where they go, harmonized in desirelessness—this is called \"pristine simplicity.\" When covetous ambition does not arise, who would become a bandit? The state of Jin relied on spies and scrutiny, so I addressed its error and guided it toward governance, but I did not proceed to expound the fullness of the Dao.\n\nConfucius, returning from Wei to Lu, halted his carriage by a bridge over the river to observe. There was a waterfall thirty *ren* high, its swirling currents flowing ninety *li*, where fish and turtles could not swim, and *yuan* and *tuo* could not dwell. Yet a man was about to ford it. Confucius sent someone along the bank to stop him, saying: \"This waterfall is thirty *ren* high, its currents swirl for ninety *li*, where fish and turtles cannot swim, and *yuan* and *tuo* cannot dwell. Surely it is too perilous to cross?\"\n\nThe man paid no heed, waded in, and emerged safely. Confucius asked him: \"Is this skill? Or do you possess some technique? How were you able to enter and exit?\"\n\nThe man replied: \"When I first entered, I began with loyalty and trust. When I exited, I followed with loyalty and trust. Loyalty and trust placed my body amidst the waves, and I dared not act for private ends. That is how I was able to enter and emerge again.\"\n\nConfucius said to his disciples: \"Remember this, all of you. If even water can be crossed by entrusting oneself to loyalty and trust, how much more so with people?\"\n\n**Explanation:** Loyalty follows the Dao of water without self-interest; trust rests in water without doubt. Thus, entering and exiting the water becomes something one does without knowing how—this is how he was able to enter and emerge again. The *Huangdi* chapter once spoke of this, attributing it to following the principles of nature and destiny; here, it is called loyalty and trust. \"Placing one’s body amidst the waves\" means that loyalty and trust are the very principles of nature and destiny. The previous chapter clarified the spontaneity of the imperial Dao, hence it spoke of \"nature and destiny.\" This chapter demonstrates the correspondence of natural principles, hence it speaks of \"loyalty and trust.\" Confucius once told Zizhang that loyalty and trust could be practiced even in the lands of the Man and Mo barbarians. His teachings on loyalty and trust are manifold, so here he bids his disciples to remember them.\n\n*Explication of the Perfect Dao of Pristine Emptiness and Ultimate Virtue*, Scroll 18—concluded.\n*Explication of the Perfect Dao of Pristine Emptiness and Ultimate Virtue*, Scroll 19.\n\n**Submitted by Jiang Yu, Inner College Student of Hangzhou Prefecture, Song Dynasty, on the \"Explanation of Correspondences\" Section**\n\nBai Gong asked Confucius, \"Can one engage in subtle discourse with others?\"\nConfucius did not respond.\n\nBai Gong asked again, \"If a stone is cast into water, what then?\"\nConfucius said, \"A skilled diver from Wu could retrieve it.\"\nBai Gong said, \"If water is poured into water, what then?\"\nConfucius replied, \"When the waters of the Zi and Meng rivers merge, Yi Ya could distinguish them by taste.\"\n\nBai Gong said, \"Is it truly impossible to engage in subtle discourse with others?\"\nConfucius said, \"Why would it be impossible? Only one who knows the nature of words can do so. For one who knows the nature of words does not speak with words. Those who contend for fish get drenched; those who chase beasts run swiftly—not because they delight in it. Thus, the most profound words transcend speech, and the highest action is non-action. What shallow minds contend over is but trifling.\"\n\nBai Gong, unable to bear it, later died in the bathhouse.\n\n*Explication:*\nWhat sound cannot encompass, the mind cannot grasp. If it can be spoken, it can be known. I, possessing knowledge, can speak; they, hearing the words, can understand. Once form and voice manifest—even if like the merging of the Zi and Meng rivers, difficult to distinguish—Yi Ya could discern them by taste. Thus, when Bai Gong first inquired about subtle discourse, Confucius, already knowing his intent, did not respond. Such is the impossibility of concealing words.\n\nYet one who speaks without intent speaks as if not speaking; one who speaks with intent, though seeking subtlety, only amplifies it. Thus, speech is not inherently unsuited to subtlety—seeking subtlety itself precludes it. Where there are words, there is action; where there is action, there is contention. I bring resentment; they return harm—like those who contend for fish or chase beasts, drenched and running, compelled by circumstance.\n\nBut one who knows the nature of words does not speak with words. Without words, there is no action. Compared to the contentions of the shallow-minded, it is as trivial as the clash of insects. Is this not trifling?\n\nThough Bai Gong heard Confucius’ words, he ultimately died in the bathhouse—was it not because, bound by his father’s enmity, he had no choice?\n\n---\n\nZhao Xiangzi sent Xin Gan Muzi to attack the Di, defeating them and capturing the cities of Zuoren and Zhongren. A messenger was dispatched to report the victory. Xiangzi was eating but wore a troubled expression. His attendants said, \"Two cities captured in a single day—this is cause for joy. Why does my lord appear troubled?\"\n\nXiangzi said, \"The greatness of rivers and seas lasts no more than three days; violent winds and torrential rains do not endure past morning; the midday sun does not linger. Now, the virtue and conduct of the Zhao house have not been cultivated over time. Two cities captured in a day—will ruin not soon befall us?\"\n\nConfucius heard of this and said, \"The Zhao house will flourish. For worry is the means to flourishing, and joy is the path to ruin. Victory is not the difficult part—maintaining it is. A worthy ruler sustains victory thus, and his blessings extend to later generations. Qi, Chu, Wu, and Yue all once triumphed, yet ultimately perished, for they did not grasp how to maintain victory. Only a ruler of the Dao can sustain it.\"\n\nConfucius’ strength was such that he could force open the gate of a state’s capital, yet he refused to be known for his power. Mozi devised defensive strategies, and Gongshu Ban conceded, yet he refused to be known for his military skill. Thus, one who excels at maintaining victory turns strength into weakness.\n\n*Explication:*\nAttacking the weak with one’s strength, opposing the few with one’s multitude, assaulting the guilty while oneself blameless—this is the way of absolute security. Yet fullness must decline, completion must decay, and prosperity must wane—this is the inevitable principle. Thus, victory is not difficult; maintaining it is.\n\nSpeaking of victory, Qi, Chu, Wu, and Yue all once triumphed. Speaking of maintenance, only a ruler like the startled teal can be deemed capable. Why? Victory relies on strength; maintenance relies on weakness. When armies clash, though strength prevails, it is not strength that makes one strong—rather, the most yielding Dao directs one’s strength. Victorious at the enemy’s gates, one must preserve with weakness. It is not that weakness preserves strength, but that the most yielding Dao, accumulated, becomes firm.\n\nThus, *Laozi* says: \"In life, humans are supple and weak; in death, they are rigid and strong. In life, plants are supple and weak; in death, they are withered and brittle. Thus, those who rely on military strength do not prevail; trees that are strong are felled.\" Only one who embodies the Dao comprehends the principles of heaven and earth’s waxing and waning, fullness and emptiness. Though immensely strong, he refuses to be known for his power; though capable of subduing others, he refuses to be known for his military skill. He takes softness, weakness, humility, and lowliness as his outward form, always abiding in a place of non-contention. Thus, none in the world can contend with him—not only can none contend, but all will gladly support him without resentment. What greater way is there to maintain victory? This is how Confucius knew the Zhao house would flourish.\n\n---\n\nIn Song, there was a man devoted to practicing benevolence and righteousness, unwavering for three generations. His family’s black ox unexpectedly bore a white calf, so he asked Confucius about it. Confucius said, \"This is an auspicious omen; offer it to the Supreme Emperor.\"\n\nA year later, the man’s father unexpectedly went blind, and the ox again bore a white calf. The father again instructed his son to ask Confucius. The son said, \"Last time, you asked and lost your sight—why ask again?\"\n\nThe father said, \"The words of a sage first oppose, then align. The matter is not yet resolved—let us ask again.\"\n\nThe son again asked Confucius. Confucius said, \"It is auspicious,\" and again instructed him to perform the sacrifice. The son returned and relayed the message. The father said, \"Follow Confucius’ words.\"\n\nA year later, the son unexpectedly went blind. Later, when Chu attacked Song and besieged its capital, the people exchanged their children to eat and broke their bones for fuel. The able-bodied climbed the walls to fight, and more than half died. This man, however, because both father and son were afflicted, was exempted.\n\nWhen the siege was lifted, both father and son’s afflictions were restored. The commentary states: A black ox bearing a white calf is the natural order of things—only when it occurs without cause does Heaven perhaps intend some portent. The ox is the sacrificial beast for Heaven and Earth, so its birth without cause is an auspicious omen for great matters. The ox is a creature of water, black is the color of water, and white is the color of metal; metal generates water, so black giving birth to white reverses its origin, making its generation inexhaustible. This is how those who practice benevolence and righteousness without cease rely on such signs to escape death in Chu’s siege. Moreover, black is obscure while white is manifest—this too resembles the pattern of first losing sight and then regaining it. The words of sages are all explanations that exhaust principle and fulfill nature, thus they never fail to align. When they appear to oppose, it is not that they do not align, but that the matter has not yet reached its conclusion. How can later readers of the sages’ works, failing to grasp their intent, hastily apply them to affairs and seek immediate results?\n\nConsider this case: a household’s black ox bore a white calf twice without cause, and Confucius deemed it auspicious, instructing them to offer sacrifice to the Supreme Emperor. Such extraordinary omens should have brought extraordinary blessings. Yet it only spared father and son from the duty of scaling the walls—from a Daoist perspective, the distinction between fortune and misfortune differs in minor wisdom, so its arrival also varies in weight according to the times. During the decline of Zhou, the six states’ sole concern was military power. Even Confucius, born in that era, nearly could not escape the hardships of Chen and Cai. Thus, for the people of Song to avoid death in battle, unless they had practiced benevolence and righteousness without cease for three generations and thereby moved Heaven and Earth, they could not easily have obtained such a fate.\n\nIn Song there was a man called Orchid Child who offered his skills to Duke Yuan of Song. The duke summoned him to perform. He bound two rods twice his height to his shins, ran swiftly while keeping pace, and juggled seven swords, tossing them in succession so that five were always in the air. The lord was greatly astonished and immediately bestowed gold and silk. Another Orchid Child, skilled in swallow-play, heard of this and also sought an audience with the duke. The duke flew into a rage: \"Formerly, a man with extraordinary skills sought my favor, but his skills were of no use—it just so happened I was in high spirits, so I rewarded him with gold and silk. He must have heard of this and come seeking a similar reward. Seize and execute him!\" A month later, he was released.\n\nA commentary states: The marvel of a skill may not differ, yet rewards and punishments vary—external things cannot be relied upon. Thus, the noble person focuses only on what lies within themselves.\n\nDuke Mu of Qin said to Bo Le, \"You are advanced in years. Do you have among your kin someone who can be sent to seek horses?\"\n\nBo Le replied, \"A fine horse can be discerned by its form, appearance, sinews, and bones. But the horse of all under heaven—vanishing as if extinguished, lost as if gone, like this one—leaves no dust in its wake, outstripping all bounds. My sons are all of lesser talent; they may be taught to recognize fine horses, but not the horse of all under heaven. I have one with whom I once shared a roof while gathering firewood and vegetables—Jiu Fang Gao. In judging horses, he is no inferior to me. I beg you to meet him.\"\n\nDuke Mu received him and sent him to seek a horse. After three months, he returned and reported, \"I have found one. It is in Shaqiu.\"\n\nThe duke asked, \"What kind of horse is it?\"\n\nHe replied, \"A yellow mare.\"\n\nThe duke sent someone to fetch it, but it was a black stallion. Displeased, Duke Mu summoned Bo Le and said, \"You have failed. The one you sent to seek a horse cannot even distinguish color or sex—how could he know a horse?\"\n\nBo Le sighed deeply and said, \"Has it truly come to this? This is why he surpasses me ten thousandfold without measure. In Jiu Fang Gao’s observation, it is the workings of heaven. He grasps the essence and forgets the coarse; he sees within and disregards the outer. He perceives what is to be seen and does not see what is not; he gazes upon what is to be gazed upon and overlooks what is not. In his judgment of horses, there is something more precious than the horse itself.\"\n\nWhen the horse arrived, it was indeed the horse of all under heaven.\n\nA commentary states: Judging horses is but the least of skills. Even Bo Le, with all his mastery, could not teach it to his sons, nor could his sons receive it from him. Why? What can be transmitted does not go beyond rules, compasses, and measuring cords; what can be judged does not go beyond form, appearance, sinews, and bones. As for the horse of all under heaven—it vanishes as if concealed between existence and nonexistence, lost as if dwelling in the indistinct and vague. It transcends all bounds, leaving no trace. Unless one disregards its outward traits, observes its heavenly workings, attains it inwardly in the heart, and matches it outwardly in the horse’s body, one may seek the state’s fine horses but never obtain the horse of all under heaven.\n\nThus, when Jiu Fang Gao sought the horse, though it was a black stallion, he called it a yellow mare. Did Jiu Fang Gao truly not know its color or sex? He took it as a mare because what he valued was its masculine power; what he held to was its feminine essence. He called it yellow because what was black was its surface; what he preserved was its inner truth. This is what is meant by seeing what others do not see, gazing upon what others do not gaze upon—thus, there is something more precious than the horse itself. For this reason, Duke Mu, upon hearing his words, thought him a failure. Yet Bo Le, though he recognized this, knew he surpassed him ten thousandfold without measure. When the horse arrived, it was indeed the horse of all under heaven.\n\nFor in Jiu Fang Gao’s judgment of horses, he silently grasped the marvel of the unspoken. In Bo Le’s understanding of Jiu Fang Gao, he was in perfect accord without a word. Without Jiu Fang Gao, the horse could not have been found; without Bo Le, Jiu Fang Gao could not have been known. The horse of Shaqiu had never been absent, yet Bo Le and Jiu Fang Gao do not appear in every generation. Even if the horse of all under heaven exists, it may not be recognized as a fine steed, while mediocre and sluggish horses may still be yoked together beneath the carriage. Alas! The horse of all under heaven is so difficult to know—how much more so the scholars of the world who wander beyond the realm of the knowable?\n\nXu Wugui met Marquis Wu of Wei and spoke to him of judging horses. This is why the marquis was greatly pleased and laughed.\n\nKing Zhuang of Chu asked Zhan He, \"How should one govern the state?\"\n\nZhan He replied, \"I am enlightened in governing the self but not in governing the state.\"\n\nKing Zhuang said, \"I have been entrusted with the ancestral temples and the altars of the state. I wish to learn how to preserve them.\"\n\nZhan He replied, \"I have never heard of a self well-governed yet a state in chaos, nor have I heard of a self in chaos yet a state well-governed. Thus, the root lies in the self. I dare not answer with what is but a branch.\"\n\nThe king said, \"Well said.\"\n\nA commentary states: The Yellow Emperor asked Guangchengzi, \"I wish to gather the essence of heaven and earth to aid the five grains and nourish the people. I also wish to regulate yin and yang to bring fulfillment to all living things.\"\n\nGuangchengzi said, \"With a heart as restless as a meddler’s, how could you be worthy of speaking of the supreme Dao?\" Later, when the Yellow Emperor returned to entreat him, asking how to govern the self to attain longevity, Guangchengzi approved of his question and spoke to him of the supreme Dao.\n\nFor when the root is secured, the branches need not be feared. Thus, when King Zhuang asked Zhan He about governing the state, Zhan He answered with governing the self.\n\nThe elder of Huqiu said to Sunshu Ao, \"There are three things that incur resentment—do you know them?\"\n\nSunshu Ao asked, \"What are they?\"\n\nHe replied, \"Those with high rank are envied; those with great office are resented by their lord; those with generous emoluments are beset by grievances.\"\n\nSunshu Ao said, \"The higher my rank, the more I humble my aspirations; the greater my office, the smaller I make my heart; the more generous my emoluments, the more I extend my benefactions.\"\n\nCan this avert the three resentments? The explanation is as follows:\n\nWhen rank is high, others envy it—because it overshadows them. When office is great, the lord resents it—because it encroaches upon him. When emoluments are generous, grievances follow—because it implies hoarding.\n\nYet if high rank is met with humble aspirations, none perceive its loftiness; if great office is held with a small heart, the lord does not嫌 its magnitude; if generous emoluments are matched with broad benefactions, none begrudge their abundance. This is the Way to distance oneself from resentment.\n\nWhen Sunshu Ao fell ill and was near death, he admonished his son: \"The king has repeatedly offered to enfeoff me, but I have refused. After my death, the king will surely enfeoff you—you must not accept fertile land. Between Chu and Yue lies a place called Qinqiu; though its terrain is unfavorable, its name is most inauspicious. The people of Chu revere ghosts, and the people of Yue are superstitious—only this land can be held in perpetuity.\"\n\nAfter Sunshu Ao’s death, the king indeed offered his son fine territory. The son declined and requested Qinqiu instead, and it was granted to him.\n\nTo this day, his holding has not been lost.\n\nExplanation: To dwell where the multitude shuns is to avoid contention; only by avoiding contention can one escape blame, and thus indeed endure long. Now, Sunshu Ao—his rank and emoluments were sufficient to honor his person and keep resentment at bay, his benefits and blessings extended to his descendants, enabling them to hold their land in perpetuity. Was this by some other means? No, it was simply that amid wealth and nobility, he discerned the principle of waxing and waning, fullness and emptiness, ensuring that loftiness did not reach peril, that plenitude did not overflow. This is what is meant by \"though rich and noble, one does not use abundance to harm oneself.\"\n\nAs for Yan He, who truly despised wealth and nobility, his case surpasses even this.\n\nNiu Que was a great Confucian of Shangdang. Descending to Handan, he encountered bandits in the thickets of Ou Sha, who took all his clothing and carriage. Niu walked away, gazing back with a cheerful countenance, free of sorrow or regret. The bandits pursued and asked the reason. He replied: \"The noble man does not harm what he nurtures by clinging to what nurtures him.\" The bandits exclaimed: \"Ah! How worthy he is!\" Then they conferred among themselves: \"With his worthiness, if he goes to see the Lord of Zhao and speaks of us, he will surely bring trouble upon us. Better to kill him.\" So they pursued and slew him.\n\nWhen the people of Yan heard of this, they gathered their clans and warned one another: \"If you encounter bandits, do not be like Niu Que of Shangdang.\" All took heed. Soon after, Niu Que’s younger brother traveled to Qin. At the pass, he too encountered bandits. Remembering his brother’s warning, he struggled fiercely with the bandits. When this proved futile, he pursued them, pleading humbly for his belongings. The bandits grew enraged: \"We spared your life—how generous!—yet you pursue us without end, leaving tracks for all to see. Once a bandit, where is the room for mercy?\" They killed him and, in the process, slew four or five of his companions as well.\n\nThe Explanation states: Niu Que, though truly capable of non-attachment, was slain for it; the younger brother of the Yan man, recalling his brother’s warning and feigning reluctance, brought disaster upon himself. Though one may say that shifts between safety and peril arise from unseen causes, in essence, the actions of these two men were excessive and thus invited such outcomes.\n\nWhy so? When Niu Que encountered the bandits, his joyful demeanor, free of distress or reluctance, would have sufficed. Yet when they pursued him to question his motives, he declared, *\"The noble man does not harm what he nurtures through what he nurtures,\"* thereby revealing his own traces. The one who recalled his brother’s warning fought fiercely but failed—he might have stopped there. Instead, he pursued them with humble pleas for his belongings, thus revealing *their* traces. Once both their traces were exposed, the bandits feared retaliation, which is why these two men were killed.\n\nYet when *his* traces were evident, the harm was distant, and so only Niu Que perished. When *their* traces were evident, the harm was near, and thus four or five of his companions were slain as well.\n\nThe Yu clan was a wealthy family of Liang. Their household overflowed with abundance, their wealth and silk beyond measure, their treasures beyond estimation. They ascended a high tower overlooking the main road, where they set up music and wine, gambling on the upper floor. As their retinue of swordsmen passed below, one of the gamblers loosed an arrow, striking the bright jade target squarely. Turning to grasp a pair of fish-shaped tokens in laughter, a kite suddenly dropped a rotten rat, hitting the mark. The swordsmen conferred among themselves: *\"The Yu clan has long enjoyed wealth and pleasure, yet they have always held others in contempt. Though we have not provoked them, they now insult us with a rotten rat. If we do not avenge this, we shall have no standing in the world.\"* They vowed as one: *\"Let us unite in purpose, lead our followers, and annihilate their household to set an example.\"* All agreed.\n\nOn the appointed night, they gathered their forces and weapons, launching an assault on the Yu clan and utterly destroying their household.\n\nThe Explanation states: The Way of excess is what Heaven diminishes, Earth transforms, spirits harm, and humanity despises. Only the sage perceives the shifts in all things, thus avoiding excess to preserve life, eschewing extravagance to curb indulgence, and rejecting arrogance to prevent ruin, dwelling only within proper bounds. The Yu clan’s wealth had already accumulated resentment through their lack of benevolence, yet they further ascended a high tower to provoke the gaze of spirits, stood over the main road to offend the disdain of the masses, set up music and wine, and indulged in gambling, giving free rein to their dissipation. How could this endure? Thus, though they harbored ambitions to dominate others, their downfall arose from a kite dropping a rotten rat.\n\nDid the kite, having seized the rotten rat, deliberately cast it down? The travelers on the road were many—why did it strike precisely upon the swordsmen? Was it not that their arrogance and extravagance were despised by gods and men alike, and some unseen force caused it to fall thus, inciting the swordsmen’s wrath?\n\nIn the East there was a man named Yuan Jingmu. While traveling, he collapsed from hunger on the road. A bandit from Hufu named Qiu saw him and offered a gourd of food to feed him. After Yuan Jingmu ate three mouthfuls, his vision returned. He asked, *\"Who are you?\"* The other replied, *\"I am Qiu of Hufu.\"* Yuan Jingmu exclaimed, *\"Ah! Are you not a bandit? Why do you feed me? I will not eat a bandit’s food!\"* Pressing his hands to the ground, he retched violently but could not expel it. Choking, he collapsed and died.\n\nThe man from Hufu was indeed a bandit, but the food was not stolen. To reject it because the giver was a bandit, deeming the food itself tainted, was to lose something precious.\n\nThe Explanation states: When he could not yet see, he accepted the food; once he had eaten and regained his sight, his deluded heart led him to perceive the food as stolen. He died for it without hesitation. From this, we know that the knowledge of heart and eye often brings little benefit to the self but much harm.\n\nHe was called Yuan Jingmu because his eyes could distinguish clearly. *The Zhuangzi* says: *\"No thief is greater than virtue when the heart has eyes.\"* *The Laozi* says: *\"The sage acts for the belly, not for the eyes.\"* Could this be the reason?\n\nZhu Lishu served Duke Ao of Ju. Believing the duke did not appreciate him, he left and dwelt by the sea.\n\nIn summer, he ate water caltrops and water chestnuts; in winter, he ate acorns and chestnuts. When Duke Ao of Ju faced peril, Zhu Lishu parted from his friend and went to die for him. His friend said: \"You left because you believed the duke did not appreciate you. Now you go to die for him—this makes no distinction between appreciation and lack of it.\" Zhu Lishu replied: \"Not so. I left because I believed he did not appreciate me. Now, by dying for him, I prove he truly did not. I will die to shame those rulers of later generations who fail to recognize their ministers. For if one is appreciated, one dies for them; if not, one does not—this is simply walking the straight path.\" Zhu Lishu may be called one who acted urgently to fulfill his resolve.\n\nThe Explanation states: Zhu Lishu was one who, possessing knowledge, forgot his own body. Human knowledge arises from deluded perception. Taking the body as the self, one values and cherishes it, seeking not to die. Thus, one worries over things that may harm the self, desiring to know all things without exception. Yet once knowledge exists, it inwardly deludes the mind, and resentment accumulates within, leading one to forget the body without realizing it. At first, one seeks knowledge to cherish the body, but in the end, knowledge turns to harm it. Thus, it is clear that knowing is no better than not knowing.\n\nFor the noble person, death may be as light as a goose feather or as weighty as Mount Tai. To sacrifice oneself to manifest virtue is to treat death as light; to resent and forget oneself—what benefit does it bring? Therefore, what the sage values lies in knowing what one does not know, and what the sage deems harmful lies in not knowing what one knows. Yang Zhu said: \"Benefit given brings true reward; virtue extended invites harm.\" What arises within finds response without—this is the law. Thus, the worthy are cautious in what they put forth.\n\nThe Explanation states: Observing Yuan Jingmu and Zhu Lishu, one sees that resentment extended invites harm—how could the worthy act thus?\n\n*Explication of the Perfect Dao and Virtue, Scroll Nineteen* concludes.\n*Explication of the Perfect Dao and Virtue, Scroll Twenty* begins.\n\nA student of the Inner College of Hangzhou Prefecture in Song, your subject Jiang Yu respectfully presents *Explaining the Symbols, Part Three*:\n\nYangzi’s neighbor lost a sheep. Having already led his own kinsmen in pursuit, he further requested Yangzi’s servants to join the chase. Yangzi said: “Hmm! To lose one sheep—why so many pursuers?” The neighbor replied: “There are many branching paths.” Upon their return, Yangzi asked: “Did you recover the sheep?” The neighbor said: “It is lost.” Yangzi asked: “How was it lost?” The neighbor said: “Among the branching paths there were further branches. I did not know which way to go, so I turned back.”\n\nYangzi’s countenance fell into sorrow, and for a long while he did not speak; for the rest of the day, he did not smile. His disciples found this strange and asked: “The sheep is a lowly beast, and moreover not yours—why has this so diminished your words and laughter?” Yangzi did not answer, and his disciples could not fathom his intent.\n\nDisciple Meng Sunyang went out and told this to Xin Duzi. Another day, Xin Duzi entered together with Meng Sunyang and asked: “Formerly there were three brothers who traveled between Qi and Lu, studying under the same master and learning the Way of benevolence and righteousness before returning home. Their father asked: ‘What is the Way of benevolence and righteousness like?’ The eldest said: ‘Benevolence and righteousness make me cherish my life and only then seek fame.’ The second said: ‘Benevolence and righteousness make me sacrifice my life to achieve fame.’ The youngest said: ‘Benevolence and righteousness make me preserve both life and fame.’ These three methods are opposed, yet all derive from the Ru—who is right and who is wrong?”\n\nYangzi said: “There was a man who lived by the river. Skilled in water, bold in swimming, he plied a boat to ferry passengers and thus provided for his hundred dependents. Those who packed provisions to study from him formed a multitude, yet nearly half drowned. They originally studied swimming, not drowning—yet the benefit and harm turned out thus. If you were to judge, who is right and who is wrong?”\n\nXin Duzi silently departed. Meng Sunyang reproached him: “Why did you ask such a roundabout question, and why did the Master answer so obliquely? My confusion has only deepened.” Xin Duzi said: “The Great Way loses the sheep through many branching paths; the learner loses life through many methods. Though the root of learning is not different, though the root is not divided, the branches diverge thus. Only by returning to unity and reverting to the One can loss and gain be determined. You have long stood at the Master’s gate, studied the Master’s Way, yet do not grasp the Master’s circumstances—how lamentable!”\n\nThe Explanation states: The *Book of Changes* says: “What does the world ponder, what does it deliberate? The world converges on the same destination by different paths, attains unity through a hundred deliberations.” What does the world ponder, what does it deliberate? It ponders so as to have a destination. If different paths lead to the same destination, why deliberate to attain it? If a hundred deliberations yield one governance, why deliberate at all? It is like those who set out for Yan driving north, or those bound for Yue taking the southern road. Once the fixed positions of Yan and Yue are clearly discerned, and one faithfully follows the Way without cease, even with many branching paths, one will not be confused. Only because learners do not clearly see the Way, do not steadfastly follow the Way, seek shallow achievements and immediate results, abandon the level thoroughfare of the Great Way and favor shortcuts, rely on deluded views to create distinctions, and become lost in the convergence of unity and the divergence of a hundred deliberations—like the man who lost the sheep, they ultimately do not know where they are going and turn back. This is why Yangzi was troubled by the lost sheep and diminished in words and laughter.\n\nThe hour of *chen* belongs to the sheep, and *chen* is the correct position of earth. Its association is with the spleen, which is the palace of intent. To lose the sheep is to harm the keeper of intent. Thus Yangzi was moved by this. Zhuangzi’s saying that storing grain and herding sheep are equal to losing the sheep also carries this meaning. Xin Duzi was one who could preserve the mind and guard intent, so he knew to ask about those who studied benevolence and righteousness under the same master yet followed different methods. Yangzi, then, answered with the parable of those who studied swimming yet half drowned. Meng Sunyang, though he stood at the forefront of things, rushed into action and became fragmented from the Way—unlike what Zhuangzi called “Mengzi’s reversal.” Thus he deemed Xin Duzi’s question roundabout and Yangzi’s answer oblique.\n\nThe analogy of learning to swim: those who study the Way aim to transcend life and death, to ferry the people through the realm of no difficulty. Yet learners lose their lives through many methods—are they not like those who study swimming yet drown? Nevertheless, those who drown are not at fault for the water, nor is the loss of life the fault of the Way. If one takes ferrying for profit, one cannot avoid drowning; if one seeks the Way through many methods, one cannot avoid losing life. If one follows the Way of water without selfishness, how can there be drowning? If one follows the level thoroughfare of the Way and does not favor shortcuts, how can there be loss? This is Yangzi’s aspiration.\n\nYang Zhu’s younger brother was named Bu. He went out wearing plain white clothes. When it rained, he removed the white clothes and put on black ones before returning. His dog, not recognizing him, ran out barking. Yang Bu grew angry and was about to strike it. Yang Zhu said: “Do not strike it. You are just the same. If your dog had gone out white and returned black, how could it not be startled?”\n\nThe Explanation states: When the color of clothes changes from white to black and the dog does not recognize it, the man is ready to strike the dog. When external things change and one does not perceive it, one’s joy and anger vary accordingly—whom should one blame? Only those who follow great changes without being submerged can speak of this.\n\nYang Zhu said: “To practice goodness not for the sake of fame, yet fame follows; fame does not seek profit, yet profit comes; profit does not seek conflict, yet conflict arrives. Therefore, the noble person must be cautious in practicing goodness.”\n\nThe Explanation states: If one begins with practicing goodness and ends in conflict, is this so-called goodness truly good? Or is it not good? Therefore, the noble person must be cautious in practicing goodness. To be cautious in practicing goodness does not mean that goodness should not be practiced, nor does it mean that one should merely avoid practicing goodness for the sake of fame. If one does not seek fame, then no one in the world can contend with one.\n\nFormerly, there was a man who claimed to know the Way of not dying. The Lord of Yan sent someone to learn it. Before success was achieved, the teacher died.\n\nThe Lord of Yan was furious and intended to punish his envoy. A favored courtier admonished him, saying: “Of all human concerns, none is more urgent than death; of all things one values, none surpasses life. That man lost his own life—how could he have enabled the lord to avoid death?” Thus, the envoy was spared.\n\nThere was a man of Qi who also wished to learn this Way. When he heard that the teacher had died, he struck his chest in regret. Fuzi, upon hearing this, laughed and said: “He desired to learn the Way of not dying, yet when the man himself died, he still regretted it—this is to not understand the very purpose of learning.”\n\nHuzi said: “Fuzi’s words are mistaken. There are those who possess arts they cannot practice, and there are those who can practice arts they do not possess. In Wei, there was a man skilled in calculation who, on his deathbed, explained the method to his son. The son memorized his father’s words but could not put them into practice. Another man asked him, and he recounted what his father had said. The questioner applied the words and practiced the art, achieving results no different from the father’s. If this is so, how could the dead be incapable of transmitting the art of life?”\n\nThe Explanation states: *Zhuangzi* says: “If the Way could be offered as a gift, no one would fail to present it to their lord.” Thus, the Lord of Yan could not compel the man who claimed to know the Way of not dying to offer his art. It also says: “If the Way could be given to others, no one would fail to pass it on to their children and grandchildren.” Thus, the skilled calculator of Wei explained it step by step to his son, yet his son memorized the words but could not practice it.\n\nHowever, the Way can be transmitted but cannot be received. Precisely because it can be transmitted, those who can practice it cannot lack its method; precisely because it cannot be received, some may possess the method yet fail to practice it. The writings of Liezi belong to this category. Since the Way cannot be directly taught or given to others, he had no choice but to embed it in a book, intending that those who awaken may apply its words, practice its method, and thereby align with the Way without discrepancy.\n\nThe people of Handan presented doves to Jianzi on the first morning of the new year. Jianzi was greatly pleased and richly rewarded them. A guest asked the reason.\n\nJianzi said, \"Releasing living creatures on the first morning of the new year demonstrates benevolence.\"\n\nThe guest replied, \"The people know you wish to release them, so they compete to capture them, and many die. If you truly wish to preserve their lives, it would be better to forbid the people from capturing them. To capture and then release them—your benevolence cannot compensate for the harm.\"\n\nJianzi said, \"Indeed.\"\n\nExplanation: The *Yinfu Jing* states: \"Benevolence arises from harm, and harm arises from benevolence. To treat kindness as empty is precisely what harms creatures.\" Heaven and Earth, in their relation to the myriad things, and the sage, in his relation to the hundred clans, assist them through natural spontaneity, without any mind of love or benefit. They regard all things as straw dogs—this is the Way.\n\nThe Tian family of Qi held an ancestral sacrifice in their courtyard, hosting a thousand retainers. Amid the feast, someone presented fish and wild geese. Tian gazed at them and sighed, saying, \"How generous Heaven is to the people! It cultivates the five grains and gives life to fish and birds for their use.\"\n\nThe assembled guests echoed his words in unison. But the son of the Bao family, a boy of twelve seated among them, stepped forward and said, \"It is not as you say. Heaven and Earth, the myriad things, and we humans all arise together as the same kind. There is no hierarchy of noble and base among kinds—only differences in size, intelligence, and strength that lead to mutual domination and predation. Things are not born for one another. Humans take what is edible and eat it—how could Heaven have originally created them for human use? Moreover, mosquitoes and gnats bite our skin, and tigers and wolves devour flesh—did Heaven originally create humans for mosquitoes and gnats, or flesh for tigers and wolves?\"\n\nExplanation: *Zhuangzi* says, \"The myriad things and I are one.\" Thus, the intelligence of birds and beasts naturally aligns with that of humans; only their forms make them seem distant. How could they be born for one another? The divine sages of high antiquity, in their dealings with different kinds, gathered and instructed them just as they did with people, for their minds and intelligence were not far removed from ours. Later generations began to dominate one another through differences in size, intelligence, and strength, preying upon each other. If we claim that creatures are born for human consumption, then mosquitoes and gnats that bite our skin must also be born for the sake of other creatures. Tian’s thousand retainers were not as perceptive as the young son of the Bao family, who had long possessed understanding. This shows that the location of the Way is not restricted by age or youth. The boy of the Bao family may be said to have encountered a thousand men’s worth of insight.\n\nIn Qi, there was a poor man who often begged in the city. The city’s residents grew weary of his frequent appeals, and none would give him anything. He then went to the stables of the Tian family, worked as an assistant to the horse doctor, and borrowed food. Someone in the city mocked him, saying, \"Working for the horse doctor for food—is that not shameful?\"\n\nThe beggar replied, \"Of all shames in the world, none surpasses begging. If begging is not shameful, how could working for the horse doctor be?\"\n\nExplanation: Though laboring for the horse doctor is a lesser shame than begging for food, the poor man of Qi did not initially abandon his resolve because of the shame of begging. He did so only because no one would give him anything. Precisely because he was so content with poverty, even mockery about honor and disgrace could not sway his heart. How much less would one who truly understands the distinction between honor and disgrace be moved by gain and loss, advantage and harm?\n\nA man of Song was traveling on the road when he found a lost contract. He took it home and hid it, secretly counting its notches. He told his neighbor, \"My wealth is assured.\"\n\nExplanation: A lost contract cannot ensure wealth, just as stale words cannot convey the Way. This is like Duke Huan reading a book, prompting the wheelwright to lay down his hammer and chisel and ask him, \"What you are reading is but the dregs of the ancients.\"\n\nA man had a withered parasol tree. His neighbor, an old man, said that withered parasol trees were inauspicious, so the man hastily cut it down. The old neighbor then asked to take it as firewood. The man became displeased and said, \"The old neighbor only wanted firewood and thus urged me to cut it down. To live next to such a treacherous person—how can this be?\"\n\nExplanation: The old neighbor’s remark about the inauspiciousness of the withered parasol tree was not necessarily made with firewood in mind. But by asking to take it as firewood, he trod a suspicious path. The man then deemed him treacherous. Yet who can say whether it was truly the neighbor who was treacherous, or whether the man himself was the source of treachery? In the end, treachery or its absence lies within oneself.\n\nA man lost his axe and suspected his neighbor’s son. He observed the boy’s gait—it was that of an axe thief; his complexion—it was that of an axe thief; his speech—it was that of an axe thief. Every movement and mannerism was that of an axe thief. Later, he dug in his grain cellar and found his axe. The next time he saw his neighbor’s son, none of his movements or mannerisms resembled those of an axe thief.\n\nExplanation: The neighbor’s son had always been the same, but the man who lost the axe harbored suspicion within. Thus, he saw every action as that of an axe thief. Once his suspicion was dispelled, he saw nothing of the sort. From this, we see that the distinctions among the myriad things are all created by our own minds. If scholars can make their intentions sincere, like the man who lost the axe, then they will be in the Way wherever they go. How could external things intrude?\n\nBai Gongsheng was plotting rebellion. After leaving court, he stood motionless, leaning on his staff upside down, its metal tip piercing his chin. Blood flowed to the ground, yet he was unaware. Someone from Zheng heard of this and said, \"If he could forget his chin, what could he not forget?\" When the mind is fixated, one may stumble over a stump or pit, or knock one’s head against a post without realizing it.\n\nExplanation: *Zhuangzi* says, \"The perfected person has no self.\" Those who do not know the Way cling to the notion of a self. They look upon their own bodies—all the limbs, the nine orifices, the six viscera—all present within. How could they not have a self? Why not observe Bai Gongsheng? When perverse thoughts fester within, one may even forget one’s chin—what could one not forget? How much more so when one inwardly attains the Way? Then the body merges with the great unity, and the absence of self becomes self-evident.\n\nOnce, there was a man of Qi who coveted gold. At dawn, he dressed in his finest robes and went to the market. Arriving at the gold-seller’s stall, he seized the gold and departed. The authorities captured him and asked, “With so many people present, how could you take another’s gold?” He replied, “When I took the gold, I saw no one—only the gold.”\n\nExplanation: To see an object and seize it like gold is to have no Dao beyond things. To see the Dao and seize it like gold is to have no things beyond the Dao. The *Liezi* concludes with this passage, for the eight chapters all use things to illuminate the Dao. Whether later readers awaken to it or not depends entirely on the interplay of desire and non-desire, perception and non-perception.\n\nThe *Shuofu* chapter explains: The essence of the Dao admits no single thing, transcending all speech. Its function excludes no thing, residing in form and number. Where there is form, there is name; where there is number, there is order. The constancy of waxing and waning is as unchanging as a tally’s reliability; the verifiability of beginning and end is as precise as a tally’s alignment. Nothing is more numinous than Heaven, whose Dao accords with yin and yang; nothing is more abundant than Earth, whose principle accords with softness and hardness. Nothing is greater than the emperors and kings, whose virtue accords with benevolence and righteousness. Like a shadow to its form, crookedness and straightness follow without alteration; like an echo to its sound, high and low depend without deviation. The virtue of Shennong and the Flame Emperor embodied this alone; the books of Yu, Xia, Shang, and Zhou recorded this alone; the words of legalists and worthies elucidated this alone. Thus, the teachings of Liezi, having exhausted the ultimate of the supreme Dao from the *Yang Zhu* chapter onward, necessarily conclude with the *Shuofu*. For the ultimate of the supreme Dao is not merely obscure and silent—it is through this that one responds and penetrates the world’s affairs, hence the matters of the *Shuofu*.\n\nThe meaning of the *Shuofu* lies in this: for oneself, there are measures; for others, there are standards. In navigating the world, one must esteem the Dao; in governing, one must recognize worthies. In responding to affairs, wisdom is key; in securing victory, the Dao is fundamental. Governing the state begins with cultivating the self; averting resentment arises from humility. Benefits bestowed bring true returns; resentments incurred invite harm—thus the worthy are cautious in their actions. Fame does not seek profit, yet profit follows; profit does not seek conflict, yet conflict arises—thus the noble person is cautious in doing good. All its words concern the peace and peril of the world’s ways, the gains and losses of human principles. All its deeds are those that speech can discuss and intention can discern. Therefore, to speak of the Dao without the *Shuofu* is insufficient to constitute the Dao.\n\nYet Liezi begins with the *Tian Rui* and concludes with the *Shuofu*. The *Tian Rui* is the tally of nature; it speaks of Heaven’s wondrous Dao, which aligns with creation and transformation, proceeding from Heaven to humanity. The *Shuofu* speaks of human affairs manifestly verifying the wondrousness of the supreme Dao, proceeding from humanity to Heaven. The great Dao’s course is like a ring’s ceaseless revolution, without accumulation—its boundaries cannot be exhausted, its path cannot be fathomed. It is ever-generating, ever-transforming, and nothing more.\n\nExamining the *Liezi* from the *Tian Rui* onward, the sequence reveals the essence of the great Dao. The movement of Heaven’s Dao necessarily begins with the *Tian Rui*. The sage’s response to the world is greatest in emperors and kings, thus the *Yellow Emperor* follows the *Tian Rui*, and the *King Mu* follows the *Yellow Emperor*. Of the Three Dynasties’ kings, none surpassed Wen and Wu; by King Mu’s time, the royal enterprise had declined. Not speaking of its flourishing but of its decline clarifies that once the wondrousness of the great Dao unfolds, it does not remain purely constant but inevitably deteriorates. After the governance of the Yellow Emperor, there must follow the decline of King Mu. With the governance of emperors and kings established, were it not for Confucius—the primordial sage—who edited the *Odes*, fixed the *Documents*, struck the *Changes*, and composed the *Classics*, the achievements of emperors and kings would not be known to later ages. Thus, the Dao of emperors and kings culminates in Confucius alone as the great completer of their enterprise. Therefore, the *Confucius* follows the *King Mu*, and from Confucius onward, the transmission of the Dao’s sequence is exhaustive.\n\nLiezi, fearing that later ages might diverge unevenly and fragment the Dao, thus employed the *Tang Wen* to exhaust its variations, preventing things from obstructing the Dao. In essence, the myriad things’ changes all arise from power, and their outcomes are all governed by fate. Hence, the *Li Ming* presents questions and answers, ultimately returning to nature, desiring that people not be controlled by external fate. As for the *Yang Zhu* chapter, it dispenses with the emptiness of the myriad things’ names to grasp the Dao’s ultimate attainment. When the Dao reaches this point, it is complete and cannot be surpassed. Yet the Dao cannot end in nothingness, so the *Shuofu* concludes it.\n\nFrom this perspective, Liezi’s teachings emerge as the *Tian Rui* and return as the *Shuofu*—thus transmitting the Dao of the Yellow Emperor, Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Wen, Wu, Zhou, and Confucius. He is what was called a “vast and authentic perfected person of antiquity.” That he styled himself Master Liezi was because he was a master, like Confucius, distinct from the masters of the various schools. Later scholars who failed to grasp the circumstances of his work deemed him unaligned with the Dao of emperors and kings, lumping his classic with the various masters. This is merely using a tube to view the sky—such a view is narrow, hardly worth mentioning. Scholars should devote their hearts to it.\n\n*The Explication of the Perfect Virtue of the Vacuous and Authentic Classic, Scroll Twenty, concludes.*",

      "translated_text": "*The Explication of the Perfect Scripture of the Utterly Empty and Supreme Virtue*\n\n**Title:** *Explication of the Perfect Scripture of the Utterly Empty and Supreme Virtue*. Composed by Jiang Yu of the Song dynasty. Twenty fascicles. Base text from the *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Wondrous Writings* section, *Jade Instructions* category. (An alternate version in the *Complete Library of the Four Treasuries* comprises eight fascicles.)\n\n**Fascicle One of the Explication of the Perfect Scripture of the Utterly Empty and Supreme Virtue**\nSubmitted by your subject Jiang Yu, Inner College Student of Hangzhou Prefecture, Song dynasty\n\n**Heavenly Signs**\nMaster Liezi dwelt in the gardens of Zheng for forty years, yet no one knew him.\n\n**Explication:** Master Liezi was a man of antiquity skilled in the Way of the scholar. Subtle, wondrous, and profoundly penetrating, his depths were unfathomable. Thus, though he dwelt in the gardens of Zheng for forty years, none knew him. The gardens and marshes teemed with worthies, yet after forty years without recognition, one perceives the profundity of his reclusion—what the *Book of Changes* calls \"withdrawing into concealment.\" Even the lord of the state and his ministers regarded him as one of the common folk.\n\n**Explication:** Those whose virtue suffices to govern a state and whose Way suffices to nurture the people ought to toil in the search for worthies. Those whose wisdom suffices to lead the multitude ought to be wise enough to know men. That the lord of the state and his ministers dismissed him as one of the common folk—this is why he was so profoundly unknowable.\n\nWhen the state was impoverished, he prepared to take refuge in Wei.\n\n**Explication:** \"The state was impoverished\" refers to a year of famine. Those who study Liezi suppose that because he could ride the wind, he must have abstained from the five grains and subsisted on wind and dew. Little do they know that once one enters the human world, one cannot escape the afflictions of human existence. Thus, the text begins with this to instruct later scholars to seek the Way rather than pursue the bizarre to shock the vulgar. The *Sayings Aligned* also states: \"Master Liezi’s appearance was that of one in poverty, his countenance that of one suffering hunger.\"\n\nHis disciples said: \"Master, you depart without a set time for return. Your disciples dare to make a request—what teaching will you leave us?\"\n\n\"Have you not heard the words of Master Huqiu Zilin?\"\n\n**Explication:** One who embodies emptiness as his substance and the Mean as his Way, who encompasses the myriad things—this is Master Huqiu Zilin, and thus he was Master Liezi’s teacher.\n\nMaster Liezi laughed and said: \"What did Master Hu say? Nevertheless, he once spoke to Bohun Maoren. I overheard it in passing—let me tell it to you.\"\n\n**Explication:** Master Liezi’s teacher, Master Hu, exchanged smiles with him, their hearts in perfect accord. As for Bohun Maoren, though advanced in years, his clarity had waned, so Master Hu, out of necessity, spoke to him, and Master Liezi overheard it. As *Zhuangzi* says: \"To know and not speak is the way to reach Heaven.\" Such was Master Liezi’s relationship with Master Hu. It also says: \"To know and to speak is the way to reach man.\" This is why Master Hu spoke thus to Bohun Maoren.\n\nHis words were: \"There is that which is born yet not born; there is that which transforms yet not transforms. That which is not born can give birth to birth; that which does not transform can give rise to transformation. That which is born cannot but be born; that which transforms cannot but transform.\"\n\n**Explication:** The spirit of Heaven, the abundance of Earth, the reason sages are sages, the reason things are things—these can be summed up in a single word: birth and transformation. Thus, the *Heavenly Signs* begins by clarifying this.\n\nThe forms of bodies are distinct, shifting and passing without cease—this is what is meant by \"there is birth and transformation.\" The Great Simplicity before any sign, the true and constant that does not change—this is what is meant by \"not born and not transformed.\" Confined to what is born, one rushes toward transformation—how can one give birth to birth? Enslaved to what transforms, one ultimately perishes—how can one give rise to transformation? That which is born undergoes transformation—what does that which is not born have to do with transformation? That which transforms ultimately ceases—yet that which does not transform never had arising or ceasing.\n\nThe teeming births are all manifestations of the true heart—this is what is meant by \"can give birth to birth.\" The bustling changes are all issuances of the wondrous heart—this is what is meant by \"can give rise to transformation.\" Once there is birth, one cannot but be born. Once there is transformation, one cannot but transform. Though Heaven and Earth are vast, and the sun and moon bright, once confined to the realm of birth and transformation, they are like a mechanism that cannot stop itself, or a turning that cannot cease. The seasons change and the years pass, unending through all time—how much more so for the myriad things?\n\nThat which is born cannot but be born, so that which gives birth to birth also cannot but give birth to birth. That which transforms cannot but transform, so that which gives rise to transformation also cannot but give rise to transformation. The giving of birth to birth and the giving rise to transformation have no end. Now birth, now transformation—no one knows their limit. This is how Heaven and Earth contain the myriad things without exhaustion, and how the Way contains Heaven and Earth without end.\n\nNevertheless, what is called \"not born and not transformed\" cannot initially be named. Because there is form, we force a name upon it. Thus, beyond that which is born and transformed, there is not another that is not born and not transformed. Rather, the wonder of not being born and not transformed resides within birth and transformation. Therefore, his words say: \"There is that which is born yet not born; there is that which transforms yet not transforms.\" This means that what is born has never truly been born, and what transforms has never truly transformed. Yet that by which there is birth and transformation is neither external nor internal—it simply gives birth to itself and transforms itself.\n\nObserving that he first speaks of \"that which is born yet not born\" and \"that which transforms yet not transforms,\" he has already exhausted the Way. Of necessity, he clarifies the principle of giving birth to birth and giving rise to transformation, which ultimately must return to self-birth and self-transformation. As for dwelling in the realm of birth and transformation yet following its course, or being within birth and transformation yet not controlled by them—then the birth of the myriad things is the true substance of my heart, and the transformation of the myriad things is the wondrous function of my heart. This is why sages are sages, and the purport of Master Liezi’s teachings.\n\nThus, there is constant birth and constant transformation. \"Constant birth and constant transformation\" means there is no time without birth, no time without transformation.",

      "translated_text": "A commentary states: What is called \"constant birth and constant transformation\" speaks of the supreme principle of creation and transformation across all things, past and present. Observing even a single thing, it is born through transformation and dies through transformation. If we take the temporary aggregation of qi as birth, then it cannot be called \"constant birth\"; if we take the passing away of form as transformation, then it cannot be called \"constant transformation.\" For in creation and transformation’s relation to the myriad things, as soon as something is born, its transformation does not cease; even after it dies, its transformation continues unabated. Transformation is indeed constant, and birth is likewise uninterrupted. If we were to imagine a single thing within creation and transformation, its birth and transformation occurring in the space of a hair’s breadth, then the principle of birth and transformation would nearly be extinguished.\n\nIt has been said that the life and death of things are like the day and night of the sun: the sun’s rising makes day, its setting makes night. How can day be called \"birth\" or night be called \"extinction\"? This is what is meant by \"no time without birth, no time without transformation.\" The first chapter of the *Daoist Classic* of Lord Lao speaks of the constant Dao, constant names, constant non-being, and constant being. If discourse on the Dao does not reach constancy, it is insufficient to serve as the gate of all wonders.\n\nIt is but yin and yang, but the four seasons. A commentary states: Yin and yang unfold into the four seasons. All that belongs to the realm of the living cannot but follow their revolutions, yet the Dao disperses into yin and yang, and its birth and transformation are merely lodged in the realm of form. The wonder of constant birth and constant transformation is not to be seen in these alone. To say \"it is but yin and yang, but the four seasons\" is to belittle it.\n\nThat which does not birth is the solitary mystery; that which does not transform is the cycle of return. Its boundary cannot be exhausted; the solitary mystery—its Dao cannot be fathomed. A commentary states: Only the solitary can pair and respond, becoming the source to which all movement belongs. This is what the myriad things depend upon and what all transformation awaits. Yet the Dao does not pair with things; things pair with the Dao themselves. What Lord Lao called \"seeming to be the ancestor of the myriad things\" is what is here called the solitary mystery. \"Cycle of return\" refers to the endless thread. That its boundary cannot be exhausted and its Dao cannot be fathomed is why there is constant birth and constant transformation.\n\nThe *Book of the Yellow Emperor* says: \"The valley spirit does not die; it is called the mysterious female. The gate of the mysterious female is called the root of heaven and earth. It flows continuously, as if existing; its use is never exhausted.\" A commentary states: The valley is empty yet responsive, responding without storing. Human life arises as the vital qi circulates through the body, entering and exiting through the nose and mouth—this is the image of the valley. What is called the \"valley spirit\" is the spirit of the valley, signifying attainment of the One, its numinous wonder beyond measure. \"The valley spirit does not die\" is the Dao of long life and enduring vision. To call it \"does not die\" is because all living kinds receive their mandate from creation and transformation and are enslaved by yin and yang. In their birth, they cannot but be born; in their death, they cannot but die. Only humans, as the most numinous of the myriad things, though they share with all things a mandate from creation and transformation to be born, once born, possess what creation and transformation cannot cause to die. For we share a single qi with heaven and earth and govern ourselves, guarding our original root. Thus, our mandate lies within us, not with heaven and earth. If one can constantly preserve the valley spirit, then one’s breath reaches the heels, the harmonious qi pervades the body, and there are those who cultivate the body for twelve hundred years without their form ever declining. Though they have life, they enter into a state beyond death and birth, enduring together with the Dao. Therefore, speaking of the valley spirit, it is not called \"life\" but \"does not die.\"\n\n\"Mysterious\" is the color of heaven. \"Female\" is the kind of earth. Flying creatures are called male and female; walking creatures are called female and male. The female is the utmost yin yet possesses the power of ceaseless generation. In the realm beyond form, yin precedes yang, which is why it is metaphorically ascribed to this generative power of things. The ceaseless generation of the valley spirit is called the mysterious female. For the wonder of the valley spirit, when applied to the body, gives birth to the body; when extended to others, gives birth to others. If one can constantly preserve this spirit, how could its generation ever be exhausted? Its essential wonder is such that nothing but the mysterious female could name it.\n\nThe \"gate\" refers to the coming and going, the entry and exit. It speaks of the valley spirit within me, whose coming and going, entry and exit, leave no gap. If one can constantly live without dying, then the waxing and waning, the filling and emptying of the single body are not controlled by creation and transformation, and creation and transformation lie within me. That heaven and earth can be long and enduring is fundamentally due to this Dao. Thus it is said: \"The gate of the mysterious female is called the root of heaven and earth.\" \"Flowing continuously, as if existing\" describes the substance of the valley spirit. \"Its use is never exhausted\" describes the Dao of preserving the spirit.\n\n\"Flowing continuously\" speaks of weakness without cessation. A single breath’s coming and going within the body may be called weak, yet to constantly live without dying is to be without cessation. Only by flowing continuously can it seem to exist yet be neither being nor non-being. \"Its use is never exhausted\" is what Mencius meant by \"nourishing appropriately without harm.\" As for this qi, it cannot be abandoned and left unused, nor can its use be forced. Not to use it is like the man of Song who did not weed his seedlings; to use it with force is like the man of Song who pulled up his seedlings. Only by using it without force and yet filling all between heaven and earth can the valley spirit not die.\n\nThe *Transmission of the Dao* says: \"The Great Simplicity is transmitted as the Dao’s words of vast emptiness shining within the scene.\" This is what Lord Lao called the valley spirit. If the valley spirit is thus, it is how the root of birth and death is extinguished and one constantly lives without dying. Therefore, that which gives birth to things does not itself birth; that which transforms things does not itself transform. It births itself and transforms itself, forms itself and colors itself, knows itself and empowers itself, dissolves itself and rests itself. To call these \"birth and transformation,\" \"form and color,\" \"knowledge and power,\" \"dissolution and rest\" is incorrect.\n\nA commentary states: Following the statement that \"the valley spirit does not die,\" this is said: if one can preserve the valley spirit, then within the birth and transformation of one’s own body there is the wonder of neither birth nor transformation, no longer requiring the process of birth giving birth and transformation giving transformation. This is self-birth and self-transformation.",

      "translated_text": "From the self-birth and self-transformation of one’s own body, one knows that all things likewise self-birth and self-transform. Tracing the Dao of birth and transformation to its origin, it is fundamentally rooted in spontaneity. To call it \"birth giving birth and transformation giving transformation\" is to posit a duality of birth and transformation. To regard it as self-birth and self-transformation seems to imply no external dependence, yet this still falls within the realm of discourse. For the Dao of birth and transformation transcends speech and defies designation. To call it \"birth and transformation\" is already far removed from the Dao; only when one recognizes that even this designation is inadequate does one approach the ultimate truth.\n\nMoreover, the transformations of the myriad things are inexhaustible, yet all are but instances of birth and transformation. When distinguished in detail, they exhibit differences in form, color, knowledge, power, dissolution, and rest. This specificity is articulated to illustrate how the Dao’s abundance suffices for all things, leaving nothing, however small, unaccounted for.\n\nLiezi said: \"Of old, the sages followed yin and yang to unify Heaven and Earth.\" A commentary states: To speak of the birth and transformation of the myriad things is necessarily to trace them to yin and yang. Yet the unfolding of yin and yang is confined within Heaven and Earth. To fathom the creative transformations of Heaven and Earth is to recognize their unity in the sage. Though Heaven and Earth are vast, they do not transcend form and thus cannot be independent of what unifies them. The sage, though but one instance of what is unified, cannot unify Heaven and Earth without relying on their inherent principles. In unifying them, the sage cannot but follow the proper balance of yin and yang.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven and Earth originally requires no external dependence and cannot be unified. Yet the transformations of Heaven and Earth, though necessarily rooted in yin and yang, cannot be without dependence, and thus the sage is able to unify them by following their inherent principles. By aligning with yin and yang without contravening the natural tendencies of things, each thing attains its proper Dao and rectifies its nature and destiny.\n\nAll things submit to the mandate of creation, yet only through the sage do they each rectify their nature and destiny. If creation merely follows the sage rather than unifying Heaven and Earth, what else could unify them? This is to say, when one is raised, the other follows.\n\nTaking the body as an example: the head and feet correspond to Heaven and Earth, while breath resembles yin and yang. By nurturing with uprightness and without harm, the qi of the body becomes vast and fills the space between Heaven and Earth. If one does not nurture it, the qi runs wild and disturbs the heart. If one nurtures it without uprightness, it becomes an inauspicious excess of life. Thus, unifying the body must be rooted in one’s own upright nurturing, just as unifying Heaven and Earth depends on the sage’s alignment with yin and yang.\n\nThough the creative transformations of Heaven and Earth remain unchanged from ancient times to the present, when the sage governs above, yin and yang are harmonized, sun and moon shine brightly, and governance brings peace and prosperity. Thus, the divine archer caused things to be free from blight, and the harvests ripened. When the Yellow Emperor sought the essence of Heaven and Earth to aid the five grains, was there any other Dao? It was simply a matter of following yin and yang.\n\nAlas, in their birth, all humans are shaped by Heaven and Earth and receive qi from yin and yang. Even the sage differs from others in no fundamental way. Yin and yang may control us, yet the sage can follow them. Heaven and Earth may give us life, yet the sage can unify them. Thus, it is no exaggeration to say that the sage’s husk and chaff suffice to mold a Yao or Shun.\n\nThat which has form arises from the formless—then from whence do Heaven and Earth arise? Therefore, it is said: There is the Supreme Simplicity, the Supreme Beginning, the Supreme Origin, and the Supreme Plainness.\n\nA commentary states: The luminous arises from the obscure, the ordered from the formless. All things are the transformations of Heaven and Earth. Yet Heaven and Earth, though capable of generating the myriad things, have not transcended form. Having form, they cannot arise from nothing. If they too have an origin, from whence do they arise? If their origin is unknown, to say that the formed arises from the formless is also unconvincing.\n\nHeaven and Earth are the greatest of the formed, yet their origins are unfathomable. One cannot say they arise from nothing, nor can one perceive their source. Yet by investigating the principle of birth within one’s own body, one realizes that Heaven and Earth are born alongside oneself—what then remains unknowable?\n\nHowever, the formless of the Supreme Beginning cannot be discussed in words. What can be spoken of is only that which exists yet remains unformed. Thus, from the Supreme Simplicity onward, their sequence is clarified.\n\nWhat, then, are the Supreme Simplicity, the Supreme Beginning, the Supreme Origin, and the Supreme Plainness? They are but provisional names assigned to the stages by which the Dao emerges from non-being into being, likened to forms and given forced designations.\n\nThe Supreme Simplicity is the state before qi is manifest. The Supreme Beginning is the inception of qi. The Supreme Origin is the inception of form. The Supreme Plainness is the inception of substance. When qi, form, and substance are present yet undifferentiated, this is called \"primordial chaos.\" Primordial chaos describes the state in which the myriad things are intermingled and undivided. It cannot be seen, heard, or grasped—hence it is called \"Simplicity.\" Simplicity has no boundaries of form.\n\nA commentary states: \"Supreme\" is an emphatic expression of greatness. As forms and names descend, they are inadequate to describe its magnitude, so it is called \"Supreme.\" \"Simplicity\" denotes inexhaustible transformation. Thus, the state before qi is manifest is named the Supreme Simplicity. All things share the Supreme Beginning, after which each has its own beginning. Once there is a beginning but no form, the inception of qi is called the Supreme Beginning.\n\nAll things take shape in Heaven and form on Earth. The character for \"beginning\" (*shi*) is composed of \"woman\" (*nü*) and \"platform\" (*tai*), suggesting gestation. Gestation is the inception of form, so the inception of form is called the Supreme Origin. As for \"plainness\" (*su*), it refers to color before it is dyed. Though it can be called plain, color has not yet manifested, so it is named the Supreme Plainness, denoting the inception of substance.",
      "overlap_context": " \"birth and transformation,\" \"form and color,\" \"knowledge and power,\" \"dissolution and rest\" is incorrect.\n\nA commentary states: Following the statement that \"the valley spirit does not die,\" this is said: if one can preserve the valley spirit, then within the birth and transformation of one’s own body there is the wonder of neither birth nor transformation, no longer requiring the process of birth giving birth and transformation giving transformation. This is self-birth and self-transformation.",

      "translated_text": "Though the inception of qi, form, and substance is complete, their sequence may be inferred, yet the Dao remains undivided. As Heaven, as Earth, as sages, as creatures—all share in uncarved simplicity and have not yet departed from it, this is called the Primal Chaos.\n\nForms upon forms, yet nothing exists—how can one see and trace sound? Sounds without hearing—how can one listen and know? Nevertheless, since the inception of qi, form, and substance is already complete, it has departed far from the Supreme Simplicity. Yet it remains in a state of chaos, not yet separated from simplicity, so though it cannot be named Supreme Simplicity, it is still called simplicity.\n\nSimplicity transforms into the One, the One transforms into the Seven, the Seven transforms into the Nine. The Nine is the ultimate transformation, which then reverts to the One.\n\nExplanation: The One is the generative number of water. The Seven is the consummate number of fire. Once essence and spirit are complete, fire ascends and water descends, Kan and Li intermingle, and the myriad transformations thereby manifest. The Seven further transforms into the Nine, and the transformations of the myriad things are exhausted. Nine is the ultimate number of Heaven; when it reaches its limit, it transforms, thus reverting to the One. The changes of numbers are inexhaustible, like a ring without end—this is the supreme principle of Heaven and Earth’s creative transformation.\n\nRegarding water, we speak of its generative number; regarding fire, its consummate number. Water is the phase of things’ generation; fire, the phase of things’ flourishing. Moreover, the generative number of fire is the secondary Two, for the Two cannot transform.\n\nThe *Virtue Classic* of the Old Master says: “The One gives birth to the Two, the Two gives birth to the Three, and the Three gives birth to the myriad things.” This speaks of water as the One and fire as the secondary Two, essence being complete and spirit following. Heaven begins with the One in the North, Earth pairs with the Two in the South, and humans attain position in the Three. Once the Three Powers are complete, the myriad images are distinguished.\n\nThe Old Master speaks of the generation of things; Liezi speaks of the transformation of things. Though their numbers differ, all begin with the One and rely on the functions of water and fire. From this, we know that the teachings of the sages emerge and return as one, mutually illuminating the Dao.\n\nThe One is the inception of form’s transformation.\n\nExplanation: As a number, the One has departed from the Dao yet is not yet paired with things, so the One is the inception of form’s transformation. Heaven’s One generates water, the abode of essence. Human life begins with Heaven’s One residing in the viscera, establishing the root and inception. The transformation and generation of the myriad things all originate from Heaven and Earth containing essence—this is why the One is the inception of form’s transformation. *Zhuangzi* says that when one is in accord with the One, all affairs are complete—is this not because one has grasped the inception of form’s transformation?\n\nThe pure and light ascend to become Heaven; the turbid and heavy descend to become Earth; the harmonious qi becomes humans. Thus, Heaven and Earth contain essence, and the myriad things transform and generate.\n\nExplanation: Heaven attains the One and accumulates qi, so it is pure and light, covering all things. Earth attains the One and accumulates mass, so it is turbid and heavy, bearing all things. The solemn emerges from Heaven, the radiant issues from Earth—when the two intermingle, they form harmony, and the harmonious qi becomes humans. The transformation and generation of the myriad things all depend on attaining the One, yet cannot be without reliance on the ceaseless process of generation and transformation. Thus, only after Heaven and Earth contain essence do the myriad things transform and generate. It is not called “generation and transformation” but “transformation and generation,” for what has ended returns to generation, expressing the inexhaustibility of generation and transformation.\n\nOf humans and things, all receive the harmony of yin and yang to complete their lives and bear their forms. Yet it is specifically said that the harmonious qi becomes humans because, though all share in life, the generation of the myriad things includes distinctions of flying and burrowing, moving and still, feathered and scaled, shelled and bare—each inevitably leans toward yin or yang. Only humans embody the harmonious qi.\n\nMaster Liezi said: “Heaven and Earth have no complete functions, sages have no complete abilities, and the myriad things have no complete uses.” Thus, Heaven’s duty is to generate and cover, Earth’s duty is to shape and bear, the sage’s duty is to teach and transform, and things’ duty is to fulfill what is fitting.\n\nYet Heaven has its shortcomings, Earth has its strengths, sages have their limitations, and things have their capacities. Why? What generates and covers cannot shape and bear; what shapes and bears cannot teach and transform; what teaches and transforms cannot defy what is fitting; and what is fittingly determined does not depart from its position.\n\nThus, the Dao of Heaven and Earth is either yin or yang; the teachings of sages are either benevolence or righteousness; the fittingness of the myriad things is either soft or hard. All follow what is fitting and cannot depart from their positions.\n\nExplanation: Discussing the Dao of Heaven, Earth, and sages, there is nothing not encompassed, nothing not pervaded. Yet speaking of the functions of Heaven, Earth, and sages, they have already descended to their roots and flowed to their branches, confined within the realm of form’s transformation, each having its own duty. Thus, Heaven can act as Heaven but not as Earth; Earth can act as Earth but not as Heaven. Sages should be all-encompassing yet have their limitations; things have their limitations yet also their capacities.\n\nIf one seeks the Dao of Heaven through yin and yang, the sun of a thousand years may be attained while seated. If one seeks the teachings of sages through benevolence and righteousness, the achievements of emperors and kings may be discussed with reverence. If one seeks the myriad things through softness and hardness, the countless changes may be enumerated one by one. For once something is bound to form, it cannot depart from its fittingly determined position.\n\nNevertheless, without defying what is fitting, even the subtlest of the myriad things has its wondrous use. To seek perfection is to deny Heaven and Earth’s greatness of having no complete functions. If one can constantly abide in one’s fittingly determined position without opposing one’s natural nature, then every thing will share in the same function as Heaven and Earth. Though the myriad changes differ, all will be harmonized under a single governance.\n\nThus, there are those that generate, and those that generate generation; those that take form, and those that form forms; those that produce sound, and those that sound sounds; those that bear color, and those that color colors; those that have flavor, and those that flavor flavors.\n\nWhat is generated by generation perishes, yet that which generates generation never ends. What is formed by forms is substantial, yet that which forms forms never exists. What is sounded by sounds is heard, yet that which sounds sounds never emits.",

      "translated_text": "What is colored by colors is manifest, yet that which colors colors never appears. What is flavored by flavors is tasted, yet that which flavors flavors never presents itself.\n\nThe explanation states: The Classic says: \"There is no absence without presence, no presence without absence.\" Now, what is called presence and absence does not take presence as presence, nor absence as absence. From non-presence arises presence, from non-absence arises absence—presence is thus absence, absence is thus presence. Hence, there are those that generate, and those that generate generation. Not generation, yet there is presence; not generating generation, yet there is absence. What is generated does not depart from generating generation, and generating generation does not lie beyond what is generated. Its presence is not presence, its absence is not absence. Forms, sounds, colors, and flavors are no different.\n\nThus, without the presence of forms, colors, sounds, and flavors, the transformations of absence would not be revealed. Without the presence of generating generation, forming forms, sounding sounds, coloring colors, and flavoring flavors, the operations of presence would not proceed. Therefore, what is generated cannot be called subtle, nor can generating generation be called wondrous. Though forms, sounds, colors, and flavors are the coarsest of things, their continuity from beginning to end ensures their generation is inexhaustible, and their provision to humanity is unceasing.\n\nMoreover, forms, colors, sounds, and flavors are of one body, sufficiently encompassing all, yet they are repeatedly spoken of because the generation of the myriad things is often partial to sounds, colors, scents, and flavors. This is stated to clarify that all living kinds—whether sentient or insentient—operate under the office of non-action. All are the office of non-action.\n\nThey can be yin, they can be yang; they can be soft, they can be hard; they can be short, they can be long; they can be round, they can be square; they can generate life, they can bring death; they can be hot, they can be cool; they can float, they can sink; they can be *gong*, they can be *shang*; they can emerge, they can submerge; they can be dark, they can be yellow; they can be sweet, they can be bitter; they can be rank, they can be fragrant. They have no knowledge, yet nothing is unknown to them; they have no ability, yet nothing is beyond their capacity.\n\nThe explanation states: The Dao constantly practices non-action, yet nothing is left undone. The office of non-action is the master of the myriad transformations, what *Zhuangzi* calls the \"true sovereign.\" Only through non-action is one unbound by yin and yang, unrestrained by softness and hardness, neither square nor form-bound, neither dead nor alive, untethered to time, unattached to things, unconfined to sounds and colors, ungoverned by scents and flavors. It issues forth qi and things, envelops forms and spirits, and all things rely on its function, yet I never depart from it—hence, nothing is unknown, nothing is beyond its capacity. As Lord Lao said, \"Its function cannot be exhausted.\" Therefore, those who govern transformation must root themselves in non-action.\n\nWhen Master Liezi traveled to Wei, he ate by the roadside. His followers saw a century-old skull, plucked some mugwort, and pointed at it, turning to his disciple Bai Feng to say: \"Only you and that one know that you have never been born and never died.

      "translated_text": "The manifold transformations of species are as follows:\n\nWhen a frog becomes a quail, it may turn into *ji* upon encountering water; at the border of water and earth, it becomes the raiment of frogs and toads. Born on mounds, it becomes *lingxi*. *Lingxi* meeting *yuqi* becomes *wuzu*. The root of *wuzu* becomes *qichan*, while its leaves become butterflies. Butterflies, in their multitude, transform into insects, born beneath the stove, their form like a cast-off skin, named *niaogouduo*. After a thousand days, *niaogouduo* transforms into a bird called *ganyugu*. The foam of *ganyugu* becomes *simi*. *Simi* becomes *shixiyilu*, and *shixiyilu* gives rise to *shixihuanghuang*. *Shixihuanghuang* generates *jiuyou*, *jiuyou* generates *maorui*, and *maorui* arises from *fuxuan*.\n\nSheep’s liver transforms into *digao*; horse’s blood into *zhaolin*; human blood into wildfire. The sparrow hawk becomes the goshawk, the goshawk becomes the cuckoo, and the cuckoo in time reverts to the sparrow hawk. Swallows become clams; field mice become quails; rotten melons become fish; old leeks become amaranth; aged rams become apes; and fish roe becomes insects.\n\nThe beast *danyuan* conceives of itself and is called *lei*. The bird of rivers and marshes is born from gazing and is called *yi*. A purely female creature is named *dayao*; a purely male one, *zhifeng*. A longing scholar, though unwed, may be moved to conception; a yearning maiden, though husbandless, may become pregnant. Hou Ji was born from a giant’s footprint; Yi Yin from the hollow mulberry; Jue Zhao from dampness; and vinegar flies from wine.\n\nWhen *yangxi* pairs with the non-sprouting bamboo, old bamboo gives rise to *qingning*. *Qingning* generates *cheng*, *cheng* generates horses, horses generate humans, and humans in time enter the mechanism. All things emerge from the mechanism and all things return to the mechanism.\n\n**Explanation:**\nThough a skull may lie for a hundred years, its wandering soul may pass into another form, becoming human again for another century before death. If it transforms into other beings, its deaths and rebirths would be beyond counting. Even as an empty skull, its form remains, and the transformations of its wandering soul are already manifold. Liezi alone grasped the marvel of his own body, and since the skull had undergone a century of changes, he pointed to it and said: \"Only you and that one know that you have never died and never been born.\" Thus, Liezi, drawing on what he had seen and heard, questioned the century-old skull to illustrate the transformations of all things.\n\nThe arising of the myriad beings may stem from emotion or from thought. Those born from dampness arise through union and resonance; those formed through transformation respond through separation. Emotion and thought, union and separation, alternate and shift. Some, through sentience, transform into the insentient—like the frog becoming *lingxi*; others, through insentience, transform into the sentient—like *maorui* arising from *fuxuan*. Some grow from small to large, others from large to small. The swallow becomes a clam, and the flying creature sinks; the mouse becomes a quail, and the walking creature takes flight. Some transform by mutual gaze, like the birds of rivers and marshes; others conceive of themselves, like the beasts *zhan* and *yuan*. A single species may undergo diverse transformations—like *wuzu* becoming *qichan* or butterflies, or the frog becoming *ji*, the raiment of frogs and toads, or *lingxi*—so varied are its changes. Among these, Hou Ji’s birth from a giant’s footprint stands as a particularly extraordinary transformation, as recorded in the *Book of Songs* and thus verifiable.\n\nIn essence, whether sentient or insentient, large or small, all things emerge from and return to the mechanism, equally abiding in the supreme principle, none able to alter it. What, then, is this \"mechanism\"? How do the myriad things emerge from and return to it?\n\nThe *Plain Questions* states: \"When exit and entry cease, the spiritual mechanism of transformation perishes.\" For the success and failure of all things depend on movement; movement unceasing gives rise to change. Thus, without exit and entry, there would be no birth, growth, maturity, or aging. Though exit and entry differ, the mechanism remains one; though their paths diverge, the mechanism is wondrous. The mechanism is revealed through exit and entry, and exit and entry operate by virtue of the mechanism. One cannot say that exit and entry *are* the mechanism, nor can one seek the mechanism apart from exit and entry. With each exit and entry, the spiritual mechanism silently operates.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* deems the knower of the mechanism \"spiritual\"—is this not the intent? The *Book of the Yellow Emperor* says: \"Heavenly nature is human; the human heart is the mechanism.\" This text speaks of all things emerging from and returning to the mechanism, yet it particularly notes that \"humans in time enter the mechanism\"—is this not because humans are the most spiritually endowed of all beings, and thus cited to encompass all?\n\n*Explication of the Perfect Dao of Profound Virtue*, Scroll One\n*Explication of the Perfect Dao of Profound Virtue*, Scroll Two\nPresented by Jiang Yue, Inner Student of the Hangzhou Prefecture School, Song Dynasty",

      "translated_text": "The *Book of the Yellow Emperor* states: \"When form moves, it does not generate form but generates shadow; when sound moves, it does not generate sound but generates echo; when non-being moves, it does not generate non-being but generates being.\" The explication says: Abiding in stillness without movement, one observes the subtlety of constant non-being and the boundary of constant being. Observing both boundary and subtlety, one sees they do not intersect. Yet when stirred by response, non-being cannot remain so. Constant non-being must enter into being, and being cannot remain constant, for it must return to non-being—such is the natural movement, which none can resist.\n\nThough form and sound are not entirely absent in their reflections, when they rest in yin to cease their echoes, over time their sounds fade, and they too must ultimately return to nothingness. Since non-being cannot be spoken of as generating, the text speaks of form, sound, and their reflections to illustrate non-being.\n\n*Zhuangzi* says: \"All things generate one another through form.\" Here, however, it is said that form does not generate form. Though forms generate one another, in truth, form cannot generate itself. There is that which generates life, and it arises from non-being. Form is necessarily finite—does heaven and earth also end? They end together with me. Do they advance beyond ending? One cannot know. The Dao ends in what originally had no beginning and advances in what originally had no duration.\n\nThe explication says: That which exists must come to an end, so what has form must perish. Heaven, earth, and I are equally confined by form. Once it is clear how they arise, one should also know whether they end. Those who embody the Dao say that heaven, earth, and I are born together, so their end must also coincide with mine. Do they advance beyond ending? One cannot know—this is to say, there has never been an end. Since heaven, earth, and I do not depart from form, the discussion stops at \"one cannot know.\" As for the Dao, it departs from form and generation, having neither beginning nor end. Beginning and end are correlatives—if the Dao originally had no beginning, how can one perceive its end? Duration and proximity are correlatives—if the Dao originally had no duration, how can one perceive its limit?\n\nThat which is born must return to non-birth; that which has form must return to formlessness. The non-born is not originally non-born; the formless is not originally formless. The born is that which by principle must end. The ending cannot but end, just as the born cannot but be born. Yet to desire only its birth and exhaust its end is to be deluded by fate.\n\nThe explication says: That which is originally non-born has no arising or ceasing; that which is originally formless has no gathering or dispersing. Once there is birth, there must be a return to non-birth; once there is form, there must be a return to formlessness. Waxing and waning, fullness and emptiness—these are the natural patterns. In life, fate arises and one cannot but be born; in death, fate is exhausted and one cannot but end. The coming and going of life and death do not depend on me. The deluded, however, cling to the body of conditioned phenomena, seeking long life without death—this is to fail to recognize the principle of inevitability.\n\nSpirit belongs to heaven’s portion; bones and flesh belong to earth’s portion. That which belongs to heaven is clear and disperses; that which belongs to earth is turbid and gathers. When spirit departs from form, each returns to its true nature—hence it is called *gui* (ghost). *Gui* means \"return,\" returning to its true abode.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said: \"When spirit enters its gate and bones return to their root, what of me remains?\" The explication says: In human life, the hundred bones, nine orifices, and six viscera are all present, temporarily gathered by qi—this is not originally my body. The clear and light belong to heaven; the turbid and heavy belong to earth. At life’s end, spirit departs from form, warmth disperses, movement ceases, the clear returns to heaven, the turbid returns to earth, each returning to its true nature. What is called \"I\"—what remains of it? The value of the Dao in mastering death lies in the moment when all things return to their true nature without losing one’s self. If one does not lose what abides in oneself at this moment, then life is governed by oneself, and the transformations of creation cannot cause one to sink.\n\nConfucius said: \"If one hears the Dao in the morning, one may die in the evening.\" Mencius said: \"Neither long life nor early death sways one’s resolve.\" Yan Hui said: \"I have forgotten myself in sitting.\" All refer to this Dao.\n\nFrom birth to death, the great transformations of life have four stages: infancy, youth and prime, old age, and death. In infancy, qi is concentrated and the will is unified—this is the height of harmony. Things do not harm it, and virtue cannot surpass it. In youth and prime, blood and qi overflow, desires and thoughts arise abundantly—things assail it, and virtue thus declines. In old age, desires and thoughts soften, the body prepares to rest—things do not precede it. Though it does not attain the wholeness of infancy, it surpasses youth and prime. In death, one comes to rest, returning to the ultimate.\n\nThe explication says: Human life belongs to the transformations of creation, ever renewing without cease, thoughts shifting moment by moment. Taking its broad outline, there are four stages. Their sequence is natural, neither increased nor diminished by nobility or baseness. Examining virtue and form, inner and outer do not correspond. In human life, the flourishing and decline of virtue rise and fall with the body—what is the principle behind this?\n\nHuman life is the gathering of qi. Qi is concentrated in infancy, overflows in youth and prime, rests in old age, and ceases in death. If one cannot preserve one’s self and the will is insufficient to command qi, how little remains within that is not swept away by things? In life, one is merely enslaved by transformation; in death, one is merely altered by it—one knows not when this will end. Only those who embody the Dao can transform things without being transformed by them. Though they follow the changes of transformation, they do not drift with creation’s flow. In infancy, they share the same concentration with others. As for youth, prime, and old age, they never lose the heart of a newborn child.",

      "translated_text": "Though death comes, it is precisely the means by which one attains the constant joy of quiescence—this is what is called \"in exhalation returning to the utmost.\"\n\nConfucius once traveled to Mount Tai and saw Rong Qiqi walking in the wilds of Cheng, clad in a deerskin robe tied with a rope, playing the zither and singing. Confucius asked him, \"Sir, what is the source of your joy?\" He replied, \"My joys are many. Heaven gives birth to the myriad things, and only humans are noble—yet I have been born a human: this is my first joy. Among men and women, men are honored while women are lowly, and thus men are noble—I have been born a man: this is my second joy. Some in life never see the sun or moon, never leave their swaddling clothes; I have already lived to ninety years: this is my third joy. Poverty is the constant lot of the scholar; death is the end of all people. Abiding in constancy and meeting one’s end—what is there to grieve?\" Confucius said, \"Excellent! He is one who can console himself.\"\n\nAn explanation: The name Rong Qiqi—*rong* suggests blossoming without fruition, *qi* suggests openness to engagement. He grasps the flourishing splendor of the Dao, his form open to interacting with things, and seeks only the joy of following life’s course, without delving into the Dao’s deep-rooted foundation. This is why he finds contentment in constancy and takes joy in his end.\n\nYet what is truly prized in the Dao is not merely the solitary joy of life—it is the means by which one perfects one’s death. Though such a person does not drown in the path of profit and harm, nor meet an untimely end midway, he is still distinct from the common crowd. As for his attainment of the Dao—it has not yet come to pass. This is what is called \"consoling oneself to find joy,\" not the true joy that knows no lack of joy.\n\nLin Lei was nearly a hundred years old. In late spring, he donned a fur robe, gleaned stray grains from old fields, and sang as he walked. Confucius, passing through Wei, saw him in the wilds and said to his disciples, \"That old man may be worth speaking to—go and question him.\" Zigong volunteered and, meeting him at the edge of a ridge, sighed as he faced him, \"Sir, do you have no regrets, singing and gleaning as you go?\" Lin Lei walked on without stopping, his song unbroken. Zigong pressed him repeatedly, and at last he looked up and replied, \"What should I regret?\" Zigong said, \"In youth, you did not strive in conduct; in maturity, you did not compete with the times; in old age, you have no wife or children; death approaches—what joy is there in gleaning and singing?\" Lin Lei laughed and said, \"The source of my joy is what all people possess, yet they turn it into sorrow. In youth, I did not strive in conduct; in maturity, I did not compete with the times—thus I have lived so long. In old age, I have no wife or children; death approaches—thus I can be so joyful.\" Zigong said, \"Longevity is what people desire; death is what they detest. Why do you take joy in death?\" Lin Lei said, \"Death and life are but departure and return. How do I know that one who dies here does not live again there? Thus I know they are not the same, and how do I know that busily seeking life is not delusion? How do I know that my death now is not better than my past life?\" Zigong, hearing this, did not grasp his meaning and returned to report it to the Master. The Master said, \"I knew he was one worth speaking to—indeed, so! Yet what he has attained is not yet complete.\"",

      "translated_text": "The Explanation states: In youth, one strives in conduct to guide oneself forward with reputation. In maturity, one competes with the times, swept away externally by profit and gain. Not coveting fame, thus one does not act for show; not pursuing wealth, thus one does not vie with the times. Free from the pursuit of fame and profit within, unburdened by wife and children without—at ease in old age, approaching rest—knowing that death is but a temporary departure, deeming the frantic pursuit of life as delusion: this is the joy of Lin Lei. Zigong, still delighting in life and dreading death, how could he grasp this man’s heart?\n\nYet even Lin Lei, finding joy in the approach of death, has not attained the Way. One who has attained the Way is utterly indifferent to life and death, regarding them as discarded and entrusted to fate—why would they suddenly feel sorrow or joy between them? When Confucius said he had attained it but not fully, was this not the reason?\n\nMoreover, his view that the frantic pursuit of life is delusion is what he has attained; his claim that present death is better than past life is what he has not yet fully grasped. As for Lin Lei—\"Lin\" meaning \"wild\" in the wilderness, signifying separation from things and estrangement from others, dwelling in the vast and desolate realm—he resembles the Dao of the sage. Thus he finds joy in death, having attained it yet not fully.\n\nZigong, weary of study, told Confucius: \"I wish to rest.\" Confucius said: \"With life, there is no rest.\" Zigong asked: \"Then shall I, Si, have no rest at all?\" Confucius replied: \"There is rest for you.\"\n\nThe Explanation states: Zigong, skilled in rhetoric, heard the Master say Lin Lei was one worth speaking to and thus first realized the folly of excelling in debate. Seeking to diminish his excesses in pursuit of the Dao, he told Confucius he wished to rest. Yet he did not understand that the course of life, entrusted to the great transformation, follows an order that cannot be disordered. While life labors us, how can there be rest?\n\nNevertheless, for Zigong, enlightenment was easy—upon hearing Confucius’ words, he understood the rest of the noble man and the submission of the petty man. Thus Confucius approved, saying: \"Si, you have understood.\" Gazing at the grave mounds—some towering like watchtowers, some smooth like sacrificial vessels, some rounded like hills, some segmented like tripods—he knew where rest lay.\n\nThe Explanation states: The shapes of the mounds—towering, smooth, rounded, segmented—reflect the different ranks of the noble and base, yet all alike find rest there. Zigong said: \"Death is great indeed! The noble man rests there; the petty man submits there.\" Confucius said: \"Si, you have understood. People all know the joy of life but not its suffering; they know the weariness of old age but not its ease; they know the dread of death but not its rest.\"\n\nYanzi said: \"How excellent that the ancients had death! The virtuous rest there; the unvirtuous submit there.\"\n\nThe Explanation states: Rest is like the breath—once exhaled, it returns. Submission is like overpowering things and forcing them down, their movement and stillness governed by another. The noble man’s rest, though transformed, does not perish; the petty man’s submission is blindly rushing toward transformation. The noble man is the fulfillment of benevolence; the petty man is the opposite. Thus Yanzi also said: \"The benevolent rest there; the unbenevolent submit there.\"\n\nThe Laozi treasures compassion above all. To transcend the realm of life and death, nothing precedes the capacity for benevolence and universal love—hence the reference to the noble man’s benevolence. Death is the culmination of virtue. The ancients called the dead \"those who have returned.\" If the dead are called \"those who have returned,\" then the living are \"those who journey.\" One who journeys without knowing to return has lost their home. If one person loses their home, the world condemns them; if the whole world loses its home, none know to condemn it.\n\nThe Explanation states: Human life in the world is like a traveler at an inn—one must ultimately have a place to return. Yet those who cling to life and lose sight of principle are many, while those who early awaken to it are few. The many and the few oppose each other; what is not right is deemed right, and none awaken in the end. Liezi spoke of this not to condemn one man or one generation but simply to unify life and death in a single thread.\n\nIs there one who leaves their homeland, parts from their six relations, abandons their family estate, and roams the four directions without returning—what manner of person is this? The world would surely call them a reckless and dissolute person. And is there one who clings to worldly worth, clings to worldly worth (should say \"cherishes form and life\"), prides themselves on skill and ability, cultivates fame and reputation, and boasts in the world without self-knowledge—what manner of person is this? The world would surely deem them a wise and strategic man. Both are lost, yet the world approves one and not the other. Only the sage knows whom to approve and whom to reject.\n\nThe Explanation states: The reckless person abandons their homeland and neglects their family estate; the strategic man cultivates fame and boasts in the world. The former’s recklessness is deemed petty by custom; the latter’s pursuit of strategy is deemed noble. Yet they do not realize that the reckless one, by leaving their homeland and parting from kin, merely neglects their family estate, while the strategic one, by harming life and injuring nature, strays from their true dwelling—how then can one distinguish noble from petty between them? Zhuangzi spoke of Zang Ke clutching his books and reading, or gambling and wandering, as equally lost like the sheep that strayed—this is what is meant by both being lost.\n\nLiezi, following this, spoke of the value of emptiness, taking stillness and emptiness as finding one’s place, and grasping or relinquishing as losing it—thus the sage’s approval and rejection can be known. Someone asked Liezi: \"Why do you value emptiness?\" Liezi said: \"The empty has no value.\" Liezi said: \"Not in name—nothing compares to stillness, nothing compares to emptiness.\"",

Thus I know they are not the same, and how do I know that busily seeking life is not delusion? How do I know that my death now is not better than my past life?\" Zigong, hearing this, did not grasp his meaning and returned to report it to the Master. The Master said, \"I knew he was one worth speaking to—indeed, so! Yet what he has attained is not yet complete.\"",

      "translated_text": "Stillness and emptiness—these are to find one’s dwelling; grasping and relinquishing—these are to lose one’s place. Those who, after shattering stone to fashion implements, then dance with benevolence and righteousness cannot restore what was broken.\n\nExplanation: Emptiness and stillness are the root of the ten thousand things. Empty, one is thus sufficient to receive the full; still, one is thus sufficient to respond to movement. When emptiness and stillness reside within me, though the myriad changes arise, my heart remains ever tranquil; though the myriad forms differ, my heart remains ever clear—this is the root of responding to things. Thus it is said: nothing compares to stillness, nothing compares to emptiness. Empty yet able to contain, still and ever tranquil, one moves through change and misfortune without departing from the dwelling of one’s nature—this is to find one’s place. To have something to grasp is no longer empty; to have something to give is no longer still. When grasping and relinquishing contend, the ears and eyes turn outward, the mind races like fire and does not return—this is to lose one’s place. *Place* here means the dwelling of one’s nature, in accord with what the Old Master called \"not losing one’s place for long.\" Once one has lost one’s place, only then does one drum up benevolence and righteousness in the wake of things’ withering and ruin—this is merely what strategists use to parade their cleverness before the world. They harm their own nature—how then could they help others restore their original state?\n\nZhu Xiong said: The turning of the cosmos never ceases; heaven and earth shift imperceptibly—who notices? Thus what is diminished there is filled here; what is completed here is depleted there. Loss and fullness, completion and depletion follow the world and follow death. Coming and going meet in succession, with no gap to spare—who notices? For qi does not advance all at once, nor does form deplete all at once; one does not perceive its completion, nor perceive its depletion. It is like a person from youth to old age: countenance, complexion, wisdom, and bearing change without a day’s pause; skin, nails, and hair fall away with the passing world, no different from infancy when nothing halted or remained unchanged. The change is imperceptible until later, when one knows. Explanation: Things and transformation form a single body; the body follows transformation and shifts. Within a hundred years, the great transformation occurs four times, and within it, seasons change and years pass, days alter and months transform. Even in the space of a single breath, the state before and after a sigh differs—old and new are not the same. It is like the wind striking water: the wave before is not the wave after; like a lamp in a jar: the flame before is not the flame after. In the space between lowering and raising one’s gaze, one’s form has already changed ten thousand times. The deluded are secretly shifted by creation yet see only the traces of their own form, unaware of the subtle workings of the great transformation. They rejoice in a thing’s completion, not knowing the principle of its depletion has already begun; they see a matter’s depletion, not knowing the principle of its completion has already advanced. In the *Yuan Jing*, Master Yang spoke of the moon’s waning: its breadth does not compare to the dawn’s radiance in the west—this refers to the subtle shifting of creation and the alternating advance of completion and depletion. Applied to the body, in the toil of a hundred years, countenance, complexion, wisdom, bearing, skin, nails, and hair change without a day’s pause—how could this be clearer? Why then does one not awaken to it? This is the meaning of Zhuangzi’s \"hiding a boat in a ravine.\" The Master, standing by a river, said: \"What passes is like this!\"—this too makes it clear.\n\nIn the state of Qi, there was a man who worried that heaven and earth would collapse, leaving him nowhere to dwell, and so he neglected sleep and food. Another, worried about his worry, went to enlighten him, saying: \"Heaven is but accumulated qi—there is no place without qi. In your bending and stretching, breathing, and moving about all day, you are always within heaven—why worry about collapse?\" The man said: \"If heaven is indeed accumulated qi, then the sun, moon, and stars should not fall?\" The enlightener said: \"The sun, moon, and stars are but luminous things within accumulated qi. Even if they fell, they could not harm anything.\" The man said: \"What of the earth’s ruin?\" The enlightener said: \"The earth is but accumulated clods, filling the four directions—there is no place without clods. In your pacing and treading, you move about all day upon the earth—why worry about its ruin?\" The man was suddenly greatly relieved. The enlightener was also suddenly greatly relieved.",

      "translated_text": "Changluzi heard this and laughed, saying: \"The rainbow, the clouds and mist, the wind and rain, the four seasons—these are the forms taken by accumulated qi in the heavens. The mountains and peaks, the rivers and seas, the metals and stones, the fire and wood—these are the forms taken by accumulated matter on the earth. Knowing that they are but accumulated qi and accumulated clods, how can one say they will not perish?\n\n\"Now, the heavens and earth are but a tiny thing within the void, the greatest of all things within the bounded. That they are difficult to exhaust, difficult to fathom—this is certainly so. That they are difficult to measure, difficult to comprehend—this is certainly so. To worry over their ruin is indeed too remote, yet to say they will not ruin is also incorrect. Since the heavens and earth cannot but perish, they will eventually return to ruin. When that time comes, how can one not grieve?\n\nZiliezi heard this and laughed, saying: \"To say the heavens and earth will perish is also mistaken; to say they will not perish is also mistaken. Whether they perish or not, I cannot know. Nevertheless, that is one state, and this is another. Thus, the living do not know death, the dead do not know life; the coming does not know the going, the going does not know the coming. Whether they perish or not, why should I concern myself?\"\n\nThe commentary says: The number of things is called the \"ten thousand,\" yet man is but one among them. Compared to the ten thousand things, is he not like a hair’s tip upon a horse’s body? Thus, the human body, lodged between heaven and earth, is exceedingly insignificant. Moreover, the vault of heaven arches above, its warp forming the sun and moon, its weft forming the stars, and the ten thousand things are covered by it. The earth spreads vast below, its knots forming mountains and peaks, its flows forming rivers and seas, and the ten thousand things are borne upon it. The heavens’ longevity, the earth’s endurance—these are not what man can hastily measure. Yet the man of the state of Qi worried that his body would have nowhere to lodge, even to the point of abandoning sleep and food. Was the vastness of heaven and earth truly insufficient to contain his body? Rather, the man had no way to contain himself. Why did he not reflect that from the time heaven and earth have existed until now, there have been countless deaths and births, beyond reckoning? Why should he alone come to worry over this? His worry was truly lamentable, for it was a self-loss of man. Yet to worry over what he worried about was to lament the lamenter’s lament.\n\nHaving already worried, and then being further enlightened by such crude and shallow principles of things, only to suddenly rejoice—alas! Heaven is eternal, earth is enduring; what do they care for the fewness or multitude of such men? Why should such a man hastily allow his deluded heart to swing between worry and joy?\n\nChangluzi heard this and laughed, and his words seemed apt. To say the heavens and earth are but a tiny thing within the void, the greatest within the bounded—this principle cannot be refuted. Yet to say, 'When their time of ruin comes, how can one not grieve?'—this is to grasp the truth without exhausting it. For where the principle of completion lies, there is unity everywhere. Whether it is that or this, in the end there is no duality. To use duality to reach unity is to have no other unity. If one understands that the One is not two, then life and death, coming and going, each do not know the other. Dwelling within the universe, drinking the harmony of heaven, eating the virtue of earth, one may peacefully live out one’s life—why need one know whether they perish or not? This is why Changluzi was further laughed at by Ziliezi.\n\nShun asked Cheng (in the *Zhuangzi*, written as \"Cheng\"): \"Can the Dao be obtained and possessed?\"\n\nCheng said: \"Your body is not your own—how can you possess the Dao?\"\n\nShun said: \"If my body is not my own, then who possesses it?\"\n\nCheng said: \"It is the entrusted form of heaven and earth. Life is not your own—it is the entrusted harmony of heaven and earth. Nature and destiny are not your own—they are the entrusted compliance of heaven and earth. Children and grandchildren are not your own—they are the entrusted shedding of heaven and earth. Thus, in walking you do not know where you go, in dwelling you do not know what you hold, in eating you do not know why. Heaven and earth are but the strong yang qi—how can you possess anything?\"\n\nThe commentary says: The Dao and I are of different names but the same reality. The Dao is I, and I am the Dao—there is no difference or separation. The realms of being and non-being, the contrast of emptiness and fullness—if it can be obtained and possessed, it can also be lost and absent. The Dao does not leave me—how can there be a separate 'heavenly Dao'? To say the Dao can be obtained and possessed is to make the Dao and me two. Shun’s question to Cheng was to claim the Dao exclusively for his own body. Yet this body of mine is but the accumulation of heaven and earth’s strong yang qi, temporarily gathered and soon to disperse—it is not truly mine. How can I possess the Dao?\n\nExamining this body of mine: Heaven endows it with nature, and with nature comes life; with life comes the body. Nature and destiny arise from heaven and earth’s entrusted compliance; life arises from heaven and earth’s entrusted harmony; the body arises from heaven and earth’s entrusted form. As for children and grandchildren, that is even more distant—they are but the entrusted shedding of heaven and earth. Thus, whether walking, dwelling, or tasting, I always depend on that which I do not know. If one wishes to know one’s body, one may observe it as a shadow knows its form. The body’s relation to me is like the shadow’s to the form—where the strong yang is, I am with it. How can the strong yang be possessed?\n\nLaozi said: \"My great trouble is that I have a body.\" For he sought to return to the state before birth, without a body, and thus unite with the Dao. Shun was an ancient great sage, yet he asked Cheng about the Dao. This was because Shun, though compelled to govern the world after Yao, had already departed from the Dao in manifesting virtue. Thus, he spoke as he did. Cheng was one who assisted rulers with the Dao.\n\nIn Qi, the Guo family was immensely wealthy; in Song, the Xiang family was desperately poor. The Xiang family traveled from Song to Qi to ask for their method. The Guo family told them: \"I am skilled in theft.\"",

      "translated_text": "At first when I practiced theft, within a year I had enough, within two years I was self-sufficient, and within three years I had grown vastly prosperous. From then on, my bounty extended to the towns and villages.\n\nThe Xiang family rejoiced greatly, understanding his words about theft but not grasping the Dao of theft. They then scaled walls and broke into houses, taking whatever their hands and eyes could reach. Before long, they were caught with stolen goods and punished, their ancestral wealth confiscated. The Xiang family, believing the Guo family had deceived them, went to complain. The Guo family asked: \"How did you practice theft?\" The Xiang family described what they had done. The Guo family exclaimed: \"Alas! Have you lost the Dao of theft to such an extent? Now I will tell you.\n\nI have heard that Heaven has its seasons, Earth its advantages. I steal Heaven and Earth’s timely benefits—the soaking nourishment of clouds and rain, the produce of mountains and marshes—to grow my grain, cultivate my crops, build my walls, and construct my dwellings. On land, I steal from birds and beasts; in water, I steal from fish and turtles—nothing is not stolen. Yet grain, crops, trees, birds, beasts, fish, and turtles are all born of Heaven. How can they be mine? Yet when I steal from Heaven, I incur no misfortune.\n\nGold, jade, precious treasures, grain, silk, and wealth are what people amass. How can they be Heaven’s gifts? If you steal them and are punished, whom can you blame?\"\n\nThe Xiang family was deeply perplexed, thinking the Guo family was again deceiving them. They went to consult Master Dongguo, who said: \"Is not your very body itself theft? You steal the harmony of yin and yang to complete your life and sustain your form. How much more so with external things—are they not also theft?\n\nTruly, Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things are inseparable. To claim possession of them is delusion. The Guo family’s theft is the public Dao, so they incur no misfortune. Your theft is driven by private desire, so you were punished. Those who act with public or private intent are both thieves; those who act without public or private intent are also thieves. The interplay of public and private is the virtue of Heaven and Earth. Who can say what is theft and what is not?\n\nThe explanation states: *The Book of the Yellow Emperor* says: Heaven and Earth are the thieves of the myriad things; the myriad things are the thieves of man; man is the thief of the myriad things. When the three thieves are in harmony, the Three Powers are at peace.\n\nFor Heaven bestows, Earth gives birth, and the labor of the myriad things transforms them. The myriad things rely on human effort to grow and flourish, while humans rely on the myriad things for sustenance. Heaven and Earth are not wholly efficacious, the sage is not wholly capable, and the myriad things are not wholly useful. What they lack, they borrow from without—is this not theft? Thus, anything taken that is not one’s own is theft. Why must one take only what hands and eyes can reach to be called a thief?\n\nYet Heaven and Earth’s creative transformations are boundless, the myriad things born of them are infinite, while human efforts to seize and claim them are limited. The Guo family steals from Heaven and Earth—this is the public Dao, so they prospered greatly and their bounty extended to the towns and villages. The Xiang family stole from what others had amassed—this was private desire. Since they had already amassed it with private intent, for you to profit from it was fitting that you were punished and your ancestral wealth confiscated.\n\nHowever, if one regards having public or private intent as theft, then having neither public nor private intent should not be theft. Yet once one assumes human form, the body is not one’s own—where can one go that is not theft? Even without intent toward public or private, how can one escape the constraints of form?\n\nMoreover, theft is one, yet the theft of the public Dao differs from that of private desire and avoids the calamities of human conduct. The theft without public or private intent, though not yet free of form, differs from those who value life and cherish the body through the public Dao.\n\nAs for the virtue of Heaven and Earth, it does not intend to be public—it lets the myriad things be public of themselves. It does not intend to be without private intent—it lets the myriad things be private of themselves. To speak of this is to ask: Are not the myriad things’ theft from man, and man’s theft from the myriad things, merely the accumulation of Heaven and Earth’s great theft? Heaven and Earth’s creation and transformation of the myriad things begin and end here. Thus, *The Celestial Axis* concludes at this point.\n\nLet us consider this: When a single rabbit runs into the wild, a hundred people chase it, and no one faults them. But when a child catches it, even if a strong man could overpower a hundred, he dare not take it by force. Why? Because the division of names and duties is fixed.\"",

      "translated_text": "The fleeting life of man, with its myriad branching and divergent intentions, clings to self-interest amidst Heaven and Earth—like those who chase the rabbit, each drawing lines to claim possession. Those who seize what chance brings them truly believe it their own; those who fail to seize it likewise believe it truly belongs to another. Thus, they covet more, strive to acquire, hoard fame and profit, delight in them all their lives, and fear only that others might glimpse their gain. How would they know that their very selves are but thieves?\n\nAlas! Heaven and Earth’s generation of the myriad things is not the Dao of Heaven and Earth. For their generation is boundless, their transformation inexhaustible, allowing men to steal from them so that households grow rich without calamity. How much more so is the Dao of Heaven and Earth vast and all-embracing? If one could grasp it, its abundance would be beyond all reckoning.\n\n*The Celestial Axis* elucidates the Six Classics as records of the Dao for later ages. It embeds the marvel of spirit within forms, names, measures, and numbers, and lodges the subtleties of the heart’s workings amid benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and music. In its manifest aspect, even the foolishness of common men and women can partake of it. In its marvelous aspect, even the wisdom of sages cannot fully comprehend it. What can be grasped lies in its words being near at hand; what cannot be known lies in its meaning pointing afar. Such is the transmission of the Classics.\n\nBeyond the Six Classics, those who establish teachings and compose books exhaustively expound the wondrous workings of the Dao, gathering its scattered aspects into unity, shedding its blossoms to reveal its fruit, discerning things and restoring nature, aspiring to tranquility and simplicity, and illuminating the inner and outer teachings of the Six Classics—none surpass the books of Laozi, Zhuangzi, and Liezi.\n\nThough the three perfected ones’ scriptures all transmit the marvelous principle, their aims in establishing teachings differ, yet the Dao may still be spoken of thus: The ninety-nine chapters of the *Laozi* clarify the essential return of virtue and the Dao. In just a few thousand words, it examines its beginning and end, declaring the Dao that can be spoken not the eternal Dao, calling the highest virtue no-virtue, and taking the sage’s Dao as non-contention. Though it speaks of the sage’s way of responding to the world, it never touches upon the sovereigns of high antiquity; though it sets forth the principles of the myriad things’ generation and transformation, it never touches upon the realm of plants and animals. This is why the *Laozi* is supremely marvelous and concise.\n\nAs for the *Zhuangzi*, it employs \"goblet words\" to unfold endlessly, \"repeated words\" to convey truth, and \"parable words\" to broaden its reach. Its text flows freely without harm, its language strange and wondrous yet worthy of contemplation. The *Laozi*’s concision gains clarity through the *Zhuangzi*, and its Dao becomes all the more luminous.\n\nAs for the teachings of the *Liezi*, their primal marvel lies in the *Laozi*’s virtue and Dao, and their strangeness likewise resides in the *Zhuangzi*’s parables. They elucidate the *Laozi*’s essential marvels without indulging in the *Zhuangzi*’s expansiveness. The three scriptures’ aims converge in the Dao, with the *Liezi*’s teachings appropriately situated between them. Only by understanding this can one read the *Liezi*.\n\nWhat, then, is the Dao? It is that which is marvelous and unknowable. By \"marvelous,\" we do not mean that it is marvelous because it is empty, nonexistent, or non-active. Rather, it is marvelous because it operates above the myriad things yet cannot be fathomed.\n\nGreat is the Dao! As the primordial resource nurturing the myriad things, its spontaneity necessarily takes generation and transformation as primary; its shaping necessarily takes yin and yang as its origin. Thus, this scripture begins by clarifying the generation and transformation of celestial portents. \"Heaven\" refers to the Dao that is not made by anything; \"portent\" refers to things that accord with verification. \"Celestial portent\" is the tally of spontaneity.\n\nTracing the Dao of generation and transformation, it cannot be made clear apart from things, nor can it be exhausted by clinging to things. Clinging to things is insufficient to speak of generation and transformation, for generation and transformation are not exhausted by activity. Departing from things, there is no way to manifest generation and transformation, for generation and transformation do not abide in inactivity. It says: There is generation that does not generate, transformation that does not transform. That which does not generate and does not transform originates in Heaven’s spontaneity; that which generates and transforms accords with portents as verification. The Dao of generation and transformation is fully contained herein.\n\nSince the Great Simplicity already existed, the Great Beginning followed it; the Great Commencement appeared, and the Great Prime presaged it. Once the beginnings of qi, form, and substance were complete, it could be named \"Change.\" Change alters to become the One; the One is the beginning of form’s alterations. In the obscure depths, its sequence already lacks even a hair’s breadth of disorder. Once it has fallen into form’s alterations, the clear and turbid diverge at their source, Heaven and Earth settle into their positions, man embodies their harmony, and things contain their essence.\n\nThough Heaven and Earth are vast, their Dao can be matched to yin and yang; though the sage’s Dao is marvelous, its teachings can be verified in benevolence and righteousness; though the myriad things are many, their transformations can be united in softness and hardness. Thus, even when shaping man’s form, none can escape the changes of creation.\n\nAs for the myriad things’ emergence from and return to the mechanism—whether sentient or insentient, alternating and transforming—this may indeed be called marvelous. Once transformation has settled into constancy, it cannot disrupt the tally of spontaneity. Thus, the transformations of the mole cricket’s feet may produce a grub but cannot produce a butterfly; the transformations of the frog may produce a quail but cannot produce a wren. The principle of generation and transformation accords thus, which is why the people of Qi, seeing that what has form must end, and observing that Heaven and Earth manifestly contain things, fell into petty and excessive calculations.\n\nYet the tally of spontaneity, in its beginning, must have something from which it arises; in its arising, must have a fitting and fixed position; in its end, must have a means by which it returns. Beginning must end, and ending must return to the beginning. The changes of one, seven, and nine cycle endlessly without terminus—this is why the principle of generation and transformation endures eternally without cease.\n\nIt is fitting that things without awareness sink into the depths of creation. But man, the spirit of the myriad things, though not exempt from generation and transformation, also possesses the principle of neither generating nor transforming within himself.",

After another fifteen years, he fretted that all under Heaven remained untended, exhausting his keen hearing and bright vision, advancing his wisdom and strength to govern the hundred clans—yet his complexion grew parched and sallow, and his five faculties dimmed in confusion.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor then sighed in lament, saying: \"My excesses have run deep indeed. Nurturing the self alone brings such affliction; governing the myriad things brings such affliction.\"\n\n*Explication states:* The principle of life values unrestrained spontaneity. To harbor intent in nurturing the self is to tread the path of its undoing. The hundred clans call me natural, yet to harbor intent in governing the myriad things is likewise to tread the path of affliction. Thus, delighting the ears and eyes, gratifying the nose and mouth, and indulging in joyful exultation—this is not tranquility. Exhausting keen hearing and bright vision, advancing wisdom and strength, and dwelling in anxious sorrow—this is not contentment. Without tranquility and contentment, there is no virtue. Though the nurturing of the body and the governing of things differ, and though sorrow and joy diverge, their harm to life and injury to nature are the same. Harm to life thus parches the complexion and sallows the skin; injury to nature thus dims the five faculties in confusion. For fifteen years make a generation—half spent in sorrow, half in joy, outwardly wearing the body, inwardly wounding nature—where then lies the joy of life? This is why the Yellow Emperor sighed deeply over his excesses and sought the Perfect Dao.\n\nThereupon, he relinquished all affairs of state, abandoned his palace chambers, dismissed his attendants, silenced the bells and chimes, reduced his kitchen provisions, and retired to dwell in leisure at the Hall of the Great Court. There, he purified his heart and disciplined his form, abstaining from governance for three months.

      "translated_text": "Silencing the bells and chimes, reducing kitchen provisions—thus are the pleasures of ear, eye, nose, and mouth removed. Dwelling in leisure at the Hall of the Great Court, one roams freely and abides in the vast dwelling. Purifying the heart and disciplining the form, clarity, wisdom, and strength are not employed. Abstaining from governance for three months, one remains still and unmoving; passing through time’s changes yet unaltered. Napping in broad daylight and dreaming, the form does not engage with things, yet luminously communes with spirit.\n\nThe land of Huaxu is where spirit resides. Forced to name it, yet it has no substance—only those who embrace spirit with their nature may wander there. Thus was the realm where the Yellow Emperor dreamed of traveling. The land of Huaxu lies west of Yan Prefecture and north of Tai Prefecture. Who knows how many thousands of *li* distant it is from this world? It is not a place reachable by boat, carriage, or foot—only by spirit can one travel there.\n\n*Explication states:* The northwest is the profound recess of Heaven and Earth, the primal gate of inner illumination—hence the land of Huaxu is situated there. Though forced to name it and locate it in a direction, it is not bound by direction, nor constrained by measure. Thus it is said: \"Who knows how many thousands of *li* distant it is from this world? Only by spirit can one travel there.\"\n\nIn that land, there are no teachers or rulers—it is so of itself. Its people have no desires—it is so of itself. They do not delight in life, nor do they abhor death, and so there is no premature demise. They do not favor themselves, nor do they distance others, and so there is no love or hatred. They do not oppose or comply, and so there is no profit or harm. They cherish nothing, nor do they fear anything. Entering water, they do not drown; entering fire, they do not burn. Cut or struck, they feel no pain; poked or prodded, they feel no itch. Treading emptiness as though it were solid, resting in the void as though on a bed. Clouds and mist do not obstruct their sight; thunder and lightning do not disturb their hearing. Beauty and ugliness do not unsettle their hearts; mountains and valleys do not trip their steps—only spirit moves.\n\n*Explication states:* As the saying goes: \"Without clothing and food, the way of ruler and minister ceases.\" In that land, there are no teachers or rulers, and its people have no desires—it is so of itself. Moreover, the absence of rulers is not because the people are governed by non-desire; it is so of itself. The absence of desires is not because of a sagely ruler’s governance; it is so of itself. When the Dao reaches the state of spontaneity, then what the world calls desire and aversion, closeness and distance, opposition and compliance, love and fear—all are forgotten. How then could there be the misfortune of premature death, the passions of love and hatred, or the choices of profit and harm? Thus one may enter water and fire, forget pain and itch, tread emptiness as though it were solid, abide in solidity as though it were void, see and hear with perfect clarity, remain unperturbed in heart, and walk without stumbling.\n\nTrue emptiness is not empty—treading emptiness is like reality, yet not truly real, hence it is said \"as though treading solid ground.\" True void is not void—resting in the void is like the void, yet not truly void, hence it is said \"as though on a bed.\" Who but one of utmost spirit could attain this? The true persons of old slept without dreaming and awoke without sorrow. The Yellow Emperor was one who discerned waking and dreaming—thus his wandering in Huaxu was a true dream. That he entrusted it to a dream was not merely to follow a fleeting moment.\n\nWhen the Yellow Emperor awoke, he was joyfully content. He summoned Tian Lao, Li Mu, and Tai Shan Ji and said to them: \"I have dwelled in leisure for three months, purifying my heart and disciplining my form, seeking the Dao to nurture the body and govern things, yet I did not attain its method. Exhausted, I slept, and dreamed thus. Now I know the Perfect Dao cannot be sought through emotion. I have understood it, I have attained it—but I cannot explain it to you.\"\n\nTwenty-eight years later, the world was greatly ordered, nearly like the land of Huaxu.\n\n*Explication states:* Tian Lao embodies the effortless way of Heaven. Li Mu is the skilled steward of human governance. Tai Shan Ji represents the greatest of earthly categories. One who attains the Dao can command the Three Powers and employ the transformations of creation—thus the Yellow Emperor, joyfully content, summoned these three to inform them.\n\nThe Dao has emotion and sincerity, yet the Perfect Dao cannot be sought through emotion—for the Dao does not reject emotion, yet it cannot be attained by seeking. The so-called Perfect Dao is the Dao that does not depart from the true. How could there be a method to be pondered and sought? Thus, seeking the Perfect Dao through emotion will never suffice to attain the Dao. Only after exhaustion and sleep, dreaming thus, and then awakening, does one become joyfully content. For in exhaustion and sleep, the limbs relax and wisdom and strength are not employed—then in dreams, one truly communes with spirit.\n\nOnly one who has attained the Perfect Dao can govern the world without governing, so that it is ordered. Thus, twenty-eight years later, the world was greatly ordered, nearly like the land of Huaxu. Twenty-eight is the number of four sevens. Seven times seven is the number of *tian gui*, reaching its mean and utmost flourishing. Though the Yellow Emperor’s governance did not depart from effort, his rule could not escape this number. Moreover, seven times seven is a yin number, and the Yellow Emperor was then gathering brilliance to return to the root—hence he particularly spoke of the flourishing of yin numbers.\n\nIf the Dao does not reach the true, no one sleeps without dreaming—how then could one reach Huaxu? Upon awakening, one is joyfully content. For what one loves by day, one dreams of by night. If the Yellow Emperor had purified his heart and disciplined his form, his waking thoughts and dreams would have dissolved. If he dreamed, it could only have been of Huaxu. But if one cannot align the heart and discipline the form, one is enslaved by thoughts and constrained by yin and yang. One who dreams of drinking wine wakes to weep; one who dreams of weeping wakes to hunt. Thus are waking and dreaming inverted, and gain and loss, sorrow and joy remain unsettled—how many thousands of *li* distant is one then from the land of Huaxu?",

      "translated_text": "Moreover, that daytime thoughts give rise to nighttime dreams is the natural principle. Yet here it is framed as a dream occurring during daytime slumber—for daytime is the midpoint of the sun’s course, the time when one is most entangled in worldly affairs. If the spirit wanders even while the body is engaged in such affairs, then the spirit never departs from the body for even an instant.\n\nLet us consider this: the achievements of emperors and kings are but the incidental undertakings of sages. The sage acts only when unavoidable, and even then, surrenders action to things, allowing them to act on their own—thus should there be no burden of deliberate doing. Yet once action is taken, the achievements of emperors and kings are accomplished, and the Great Dao recedes. When Liezi sought to clarify how the sage responds to the role of emperor or king while never straying from the ultimate Dao, he began his discourse with the Yellow Emperor, for in speaking of the Dao, the Yellow Emperor represents its highest attainment. Yet upon ascending the throne and engaging with the world, the tumult of worldly entanglements arises. Whether governing or in chaos, joy or sorrow, such involvements become unavoidable.\n\nNevertheless, the Yellow Emperor, emerging from the great source to respond to things, constantly embodied the inexhaustible and wandered without obstruction. Thus, he entrusted his worldly engagements to the dream of Huaxu to dispel their traces. When he aligned his heart and disciplined his form, gathering the traces of worldly response to return to the ultimate Dao, he nearly attained the governance of the Huaxu clan—such was the Yellow Emperor that the world never beheld. People merely cling to his outdated traces, pondering without enlightenment.\n\nTherefore, this chapter concludes with Jixian’s physiognomy of Master Hu, revealing to him that which had never departed from the source—whereupon Jixian, unable to divine anything, fled in disarray. This discourse thus elucidates the ultimate principle of rulership, which is why *Zhuangzi’s* “Responding to Emperors and Kings” also concludes with this passage.\n\nMount Liegushe lies amidst the islands of the sea and rivers. Upon its summit dwells a spirit-person who inhales the wind and drinks the dew, partaking not of the five grains. The heart is like a deep spring, the form like a maiden’s; neither clinging nor cherishing, immortals and sages serve as ministers; neither fearing nor angering, the sincere and guileless act as envoys. Without bestowing or favoring, things are naturally sufficient; without amassing or hoarding, one remains free of fault. Yin and yang are ever harmonized, sun and moon ever bright, the four seasons ever orderly, wind and rain ever balanced, nurturance ever timely, grains ever abundant. The land knows no blight, people no premature death, creatures no blemish or plague, and ghosts no eerie manifestations.\n\nExplanation: *Gu* means “for the time being,” and *she* means “to be sated.”",

      "translated_text": "Mount Guye is where those who, wearied by worldly entanglements, dwell in temporary response to what cannot be avoided. Water nearly approaches the Dao, and the sea is where the waters of rivers return. Mount Guye lies amid its isles, signifying its place at the center of the Dao—who but a spirit-person could abide here? Not eating the five grains, inhaling the wind and drinking the dew, one savors the Dao’s blandness, which is flavorless. The heart like a deep spring is still and concentrated, never straying. The form like a maiden responds to things without initiating. Neither clinging nor cherishing, one treats the myriad things as straw dogs. Neither fearing nor angering, one guards the purity of qi. Without bestowing or favoring, things are naturally sufficient—this is what is meant by \"no one loses a single hair.\" Without amassing or hoarding, one remains free of fault—this is what is meant by \"no one seeks gain from the world.\" From the ever-harmonized yin and yang to the absence of eerie manifestations among ghosts, this is what Lord Lao called \"peace and great stability.\"\n\nLiezi studied under Master Lao Shang and befriended Bo Gaozi. *Shang* means the sound of metal; *Lao Shang* refers to one who returns to nature, restores destiny, and practices non-action. *Bo Gaozi* refers to one whose years grow ever higher and whose virtue ever more expansive. Thus did Liezi take such figures as teachers and friends. Liezi once studied under Master Huqiu and befriended Bohun Maoren. Since the Dao is present everywhere, what fixed teacher could there be? Advancing the Way of these two masters, he rode the wind and returned.\n\nYin Sheng heard of this and lived with Liezi, yet for months he did not attend to his own dwelling. Finding an opportunity, he requested to learn his arts, but after ten inquiries, Liezi gave no answer. Yin Sheng, resentful, asked to leave, but Liezi did not respond. Yin Sheng withdrew. Months later, his resolve unshaken, he returned to follow Liezi again. Liezi said, \"Why do you come and go so frequently?\" Yin Sheng replied, \"Before, when Zhang Dai asked you, you did not tell me, so I harbored resentment. Now, my grievance has dissolved, and so I have returned.\" Liezi said, \"Formerly, I took you for one who understood, but now your vulgarity has reached this point? Ji, I will tell you what I learned from my master.\"\n\n*Zhuangzi* says: If the Dao could be conveyed to others, none would fail to tell their brothers. Ten inquiries met with ten refusals—it was not that he did not wish to tell, but that he did not know how to tell. When Nie Que questioned Wang Ni, four questions met with four non-answers. To know that questioning is futile is to say that three questions met with three non-answers would be excessive. As for Zhang Dai, he was one who exalted literary refinement and placed it above all else—how could he be fit to speak of Master Lao Shang’s non-action? Thus, having followed Liezi, he left in resentment, and after months away, returned with his grievance dissolved. His comings and goings were inconsistent, his resentments repeated—so vulgar and unenlightened in the Dao, he would never draw near. Thus, Liezi was compelled to tell him:\n\n\"Since I began serving my master and befriending such men, after three years, my heart dared not entertain right or wrong, my mouth dared not speak of benefit or harm, and only then did my master deign to glance at me. After five years, my heart again pondered right and wrong, my mouth again spoke of benefit and harm, and only then did my master relax his expression and smile. After seven years, my heart followed its thoughts without right or wrong, my mouth spoke without benefit or harm, and only then did my master draw me to sit beside him. After nine years, my heart roamed freely in its thoughts, my mouth spoke freely, yet I knew not whether my right and wrong, benefit and harm were mine or another’s; I knew not whether my master was my teacher or those men my friends—inner and outer had merged. Only then were my eyes like ears, my ears like nose, my nose like mouth, all the same. My heart congealed, my form dissolved, bones and flesh fused entirely. I did not sense the body’s support or the feet’s tread, drifting with the wind east and west like a leaf or dry husk—did the wind ride me, or did I ride the wind?\n\nNow you, having entered the master’s gate for barely a moment, have already harbored resentment twice. Your limbs will not bear qi, your joints will not be supported by the earth. To tread emptiness and ride the wind—how could you hope for this?\" Yin Sheng was deeply shaken, held his breath for a long while, and dared not speak again.",

What I deem beneficial, others may find harmful—thus benefit and harm originally have no constant truth. The reason right and wrong, benefit and harm arise is this: in human life, desire arises from having a body, and love arises from the body. Desire gives rise to love, and the seven emotions intermingle. The eyes pursue form, the ears follow sound, the nose drifts toward fragrance, the tongue craves flavor. Within a single body, each part remains unaware of the others. Though all share in the perceptions of ears and eyes, left and right occupy different positions, so brightness and darkness may differ—how then can there be no divergence? From this we know that right and wrong, benefit and harm all emerge from the perceptions of ears, eyes, nose, and mouth. Yet these perceptions arise from the luminous and perfect nature. When nature confronts things, things align with the self, thereby forming the body. Though the body is not unified, nature ultimately remains undivided.\n\nWhen this singular nature splits into the seven emotions, it does not originally belong to them. If it then severs from the luminous whole, why should it depend on external things? If one can awaken to even a single truth amid sounds, forms, scents, and flavors, and return to rest in the real, then the seven apertures all withdraw. Ears, eyes, nose, and mouth merge into one. Looking back upon the myriad things of the world, their bustling confusion appears like snowflakes glimpsed through a veil—all dissolve and unite with true essence. How much more so for this single body of ours? This is the Way by which Liezi treads emptiness and rides the wind. Liezi possessed innate knowledge of this Way and attained it naturally—what need had he for study? Yet to transmit instruction, he necessarily placed it within the context of a learner, guiding them step by step through ordered practice.\n\nIf the heart dares not entertain thoughts of right and wrong, and the mouth dares not speak of benefit and harm, then one can cast off cunning and artifice. This marks the progression from a year in the wild to three years of penetrating understanding. The \"dare not\" does not mean the absence of such thoughts—it means one has not yet reached the state where the Way is present at a single glance. Thus, one first receives but a glance from Old Shang. By the fifth year, the heart again contemplates right and wrong, the mouth again speaks of benefit and harm. Yet these thoughts and words arise naturally, without pride or reluctance, so the Way flows unimpeded through the heart. Thus, the master relaxes his countenance and smiles, no longer selecting among the heart’s thoughts or the mouth’s words.\n\nUntil the seventh year of celestial completion, one cannot yet act freely without constraint—such a one is not yet fit to weigh alternatives. How could they keep pace with Huzi, matching his level and driving abreast? Only when thoughts follow the heart and words follow the mouth, utterly devoid of right and wrong, benefit and harm, does the master draw them near to share his seat. Yet even then, this is merely acting freely—though one may say there is no right and wrong, benefit and harm, one has not yet attained the state of \"no nothingness.\"\n\nOnly after advancing to the ninth year of great subtlety do the heart’s thoughts and the tongue’s words flow unbounded. One no longer knows others’ right and wrong, benefit and harm, nor one’s own—all becomes the same. When the Way reaches this point, one values neither natural endowment nor teacher. Thus, one no longer knows whether the master is one’s teacher or those men one’s friends—inner and outer merge. Only then do the seven apertures return to the one real, the hundred bones harmonize with the great void. Dwelling between heaven and earth, one drifts with the wind east and west like a leaf or dry husk—does the wind ride me, or do I ride the wind?\n\nTo say I ride the wind—does the drifting leaf also have a mind to ride the wind? To say the wind rides me—does the wind’s blowing ever depend on me? Yet riding the wind and traveling, one moves with effortless grace, not knowing why it is so, only that it is so. Though it is said that bones and flesh entirely fuse, one still compares them to leaves and husks. For there is the qi of life and the form of existence—one can make them empty but not make them nothing. Though there is form, one is not burdened by it—this may be called emptiness. Though still as light as a leaf or husk, one has not yet departed from \"having something.\" This is why *Zhuangzi* says Liezi still had something to depend on—this is the great subtlety of the Way. If it were merely nothingness, what value would the Way hold?\n\nAs for one like Yin Sheng, harboring resentment within, his qi of anger and frustration disrupts the great harmony. His life is but a wart or tumor upon heaven and earth. Having entered the master’s gate for barely a moment, he has already expressed resentment twice. If he carries these deluded emotions to the end of his days, he will only sink deeper. Though the earth’s vast capacity bears all, it cannot support even a single joint of his sinking body.\n\nAlas! All living beings share the same mandate from creation, yet a single divergence in emotion and thought leads to such vast differences in ascent and descent. Thus, Liezi took special care to address this. Liezi asked Guan Yin: \"The perfected person moves through water without obstruction, treads fire without heat, walks above the myriad things without fear. May I ask how one attains this?\" Guan Yin replied: \"This is the preservation of pure qi—it does not belong to the realm of cleverness, skill, or boldness.\"\n\nA commentary states: The perfected person does not depart from the real. With the real within, what thing could alter it? This is why the perfected person enters water without getting wet, enters fire without heat, ascends heights without fear. Guan Yin speaks of attaining this through the preservation of pure qi—\"pure\" means not diminishing one’s spirit. Not diminishing one’s spirit is how one remains real. As for cleverness, skill, and boldness, these involve a mind set on overcoming things. With suspicion and calculation within and blustering qi without, even a single joint or part of the body would not be tolerated between heaven and earth—how could one draw near to water or fire?",
      "overlap_context": "I did not sense the body’s support or the feet’s tread, drifting with the wind east and west like a leaf or dry husk—did the wind ride me, or did I ride the wind?\n\nNow you, having entered the master’s gate for barely a moment, have already harbored resentment twice. Your limbs will not bear qi, your joints will not be supported by the earth. To tread emptiness and ride the wind—how could you hope for this?\" Yin Sheng was deeply shaken, held his breath for a long while, and dared not speak again.",

      "translated_text": "Only when pure qi is inwardly preserved do knowledge and perception revert, sight and hearing withdraw inward, and none can discern their agency—water and fire become one with them. This is why there is no entry where they do not find themselves at ease.\n\nThe Old Master said: *\"One whose virtue is profoundly contained is like a newborn babe.\"* This is precisely what is meant by the preservation of pure qi. Thus, poisonous creatures do not sting, fierce beasts do not seize, and grasping birds do not strike. Ji, the fish, speaks to you: All that has form, image, sound, or color is but *thing*—how can one thing be distant from another? Yet how could this suffice to reach the primordial? It is but *form* after all.\n\nA commentary states: Form, image, sound, and color are all called *form*. All things arise from non-being into being, beginning with movement and giving rise to form. When primordial simplicity is complete, physical form first becomes manifest. Yet primordial simplicity does not reach the Great Beginning—how then could it attain the primordial? Only one who treats things as things yet is not a thing can reach the primordial. In reaching the primordial, does this not resemble what the Old Master called *\"a thing unformed and complete\"*? It is the creation of things before form, resting where there is no transformation. Yet those who attain this and exhaust it—how could they be called *upright*?\n\nA commentary states: All that has form belongs to creation and transformation. Only that which creates before form rests where there is no transformation. Those who attain this Dao and exhaust it depart from form, transcend transformation, and reach the state before things, dissolving distinctions of right and wrong. Though uniquely upright, this cannot be named. This is how the perfected person remains real.\n\nThey dwell in a measure not profound, conceal themselves in a principle without end, and roam through the beginning and end of the myriad things.\n\nA commentary states: What is most easy to know and most easy to practice—this is the measure not profound, for it does not violate the natural course of the myriad things. The Old Master took *\"following and meeting without seeing its head or tail\"* as the principle of the Dao—this is what is meant by the principle without end. Moving among the myriad things, the myriad things receive it to wax and wane, fill and empty. Its boundary cannot be exhausted—this is roaming through the beginning and end of the myriad things. Inwardly able to dwell and conceal, outwardly able to roam among things—this is the perfection and fullness of the Dao.\n\nUnify their nature, nurture their qi, contain their virtue, and thereby connect with the source of things.\n\nA commentary states: Unifying their nature prevents division; nurturing their qi prevents depletion; containing their virtue prevents dispersion. Thus, they can ascend and roam with the Creator—this is what is meant by connecting with the source of things. Those who are thus have their heavenly endowment intact, their spirit unobstructed—how could things enter them?\n\nA commentary states: From what could things arise? How could uprightness emerge? Roaming through the beginning and end of the myriad things, they connect with the source of things. Connecting with the source of things, they attain heaven; attaining heaven, they attain spirit. Their heavenly endowment intact, their spirit has no division. With their spirit undivided, the preservation of pure qi is firmly established—thus, nothing can enter them.\n\nWhen a drunkard falls from a cart, though the speed be great, he does not die. His bones and joints are the same as others’, yet the harm he suffers differs—his spirit is whole. He does not know he is riding, nor does he know he has fallen. Life and death, alarm and fear do not enter his breast; thus, he does not tremble before things. If one can be whole through wine and yet be thus, how much more so when whole through heaven? The sage conceals himself in heaven—thus, nothing can harm him.\n\nA commentary states: Spirit gives life to form, and form completes spirit. Without spirit, form cannot live; without form, spirit cannot be realized. For spirit to remain whole and undiminished, its loss comes from knowledge. For form to remain whole and unharmed, its injury comes from resisting things. Yet spirit gives life to form—those who cherish their form do not necessarily preserve their spirit, but when spirit is preserved, nothing can resist it. The drunkard on the cart, unaware of riding or falling—this is how his spirit remains whole. With spirit whole, life and death, alarm and fear cannot move his center. Though he falls from the cart, it can only harm his form, not his spirit—this is why his harm differs from others’, and though the speed be great, he does not die. Yet being whole through wine is merely drowning in intoxication and confusing one’s knowledge—it is not knowledge that forgets emotion. As for sobriety, knowledge remains clear and never forgotten for a moment—thus, though he does not die, he may still suffer harm. But if true knowledge is without knowledge, then even water and fire cannot scorch or drown, let alone a fall from a cart. This is how being whole through heaven means nothing can harm one. The sage conceals himself in this—this is the way of long life and enduring vision.\n\nLiezi drew his bow to the full for Bohun Wuren, placing a cup of water on his elbow and loosing the arrow. The arrowhead followed in succession, and the next arrow found its place. At that moment, he was like a wooden figure.\n\nBohun Wuren said: *\"This is the shooting of one who shoots, not the shooting of one who does not shoot. Try standing with me atop a high mountain, treading on perilous rocks, facing an abyss of a hundred fathoms—could you shoot then?\"*\n\nThereupon, Wuren ascended the high mountain, trod on perilous rocks, faced the hundred-fathom abyss, and turned his back, hesitating, with two parts of his feet hanging over the edge. He beckoned Liezi forward. Liezi prostrated himself on the ground, sweating to his heels.\n\nBohun Wuren said: *\"The perfected person gazes above into the blue sky, plunges below into the yellow springs, roams to the eight limits, yet their spirit and qi remain unchanged. Now you tremble with fear in your eyes—your center is in peril.\"*\n\nA commentary states: *\"Drew his bow to the full\"* means he drew it to the arrowhead’s limit. *\"Placing a cup of water on his elbow\"* means his stance was steady and precise. *\"The arrowhead followed in succession\"* means his skill was exact. *\"The next arrow found its place\"* means his shooting was swift.",

In the archery of archery, what one aims for lies without; in the archery of non-archery, what one holds fast to lies within. The archery of archery may or may not succeed; the archery of non-archery admits no success or failure. When one is like a wooden figurine, there is nothing to fear without. The reason he prostrated himself and sweated was that his heart clung to something. The mountain’s height, the rock’s peril, the abyss’s depth—none of these harbored intent to harm; not all who climb or tread encounter disaster. It is only because of clinging to life, submitting outwardly to pride and stinginess, that one goes to every extreme.

      "translated_text": "When He Sheng and Zi Bo—both esteemed guests of the Fan clan—went on a journey, they passed through the fields outside the village and lodged at the hut of Tian Geng, a field warden named Shang Qiu Kai. In the dead of night, He Sheng and Zi Bo spoke to each other of Zihua’s fame and power, how he could make the living perish and the dead live, the rich poor and the poor rich. Shang Qiu Kai, who had long suffered from hunger and cold, secretly listened from behind the north window. Thereupon, he borrowed grain and carried a basket to Zihua’s gate.\n\nIt is said: He Sheng and Zi Bo were both high-ranking guests of the Fan clan, so their knowledge of the clan’s fame and power was precise. That they spoke of Zihua’s influence in the middle of the night shows they were not boasting to others. Shang Qiu Kai, who overheard from beside the window, knew their words were unintentional and not false. Thus, taking their words as truth, he feared only that sincerity might fall short or action might not keep pace. Zihua’s followers were all from noble families, clad in white silk, riding in carriages, walking with slow steps and haughty gazes. When they saw Shang Qiu Kai—old, frail, dark-faced, and careless in dress—they all sneered at him. Soon, they grew familiar, mocking and deceiving him, pushing and shoving, doing whatever they pleased. Shang Qiu Kai never showed anger, and the guests’ tricks soon wore thin, their jesting exhausted.\n\nIt is said: Zihua’s followers took their mockery and deceitful tricks as amusement, seeking to outdo each other and humiliate others. Had Shang Qiu Kai taken their insults as lies and resented them, Zihua’s ambitions would have soared while Shang Qiu Kai would have truly been shamed. But now, meeting them with sincerity and never showing anger, though their tricks were many, they soon grew feeble; though their laughter was merry, it soon tired. In the end, they could not shame Shang Qiu Kai. Looking back, were not their past mockery and jesting merely futile and self-humiliating? Thereupon, they ascended a high terrace with Shang Qiu Kai and, before the crowd, declared: “Whoever can leap down will be rewarded with a hundred gold pieces.” The crowd all clamored to respond. Shang Qiu Kai, taking their words as true, leapt first. His form was like a flying bird, soaring to the ground, yet his bones were nearly unharmed.\n\nIt is said: When suspicion and doubt vanish and sincerity is inwardly preserved, the body becomes weightless. Thus, his lightness resembled a bird’s flight from the high terrace, his bones nearly unscathed—just as a drunkard falls from a carriage, suffering harm differently from others. The Fan clan’s followers thought it a fluke and did not yet find it strange. Then, pointing to a secluded bend in the river, they said: “There is a treasure pearl within; you may dive to retrieve it.” Shang Qiu Kai dove again and, upon emerging, indeed found a pearl. The crowd began to doubt in unison. Zihua then ordered that he be given meat, fine clothes, and silk.\n\nIt is said: Believing their words and diving into the water without drowning—this was loyalty and trust placing his body amidst the waves. They deceived him into thinking there was a treasure pearl within; he dove and emerged, indeed finding a pearl. What principle was this? It was proof that sincerity can move things. Moreover, the treasure pearl, in its essence and wondrous use, becomes clearer the deeper one goes, present everywhere. Sought with cleverness or demanded with scorn, the loss grows greater. Only Shang Qiu Kai’s sincerity matched the formless, so how was his success any different?\n\nSoon after, a great fire broke out in the Fan clan’s treasury. Zihua said: “Whoever can enter the fire and retrieve brocade will be rewarded according to what they bring back.” Shang Qiu Kai went without hesitation, entering and exiting the flames unscathed—no dust clung to him, his body was not scorched. The Fan clan’s followers, believing him to possess the Dao, apologized together: “We did not know you possessed the Dao and deceived you; we did not know you were a divine person and humiliated you. You must think us fools, deaf, blind. We dare ask: what is your Dao?” Shang Qiu Kai replied: “I possess no Dao. Even my own heart does not know the reason. Nevertheless, there is one thing—I will try to tell you.”",

      "translated_text": "When the two guests you sent once lodged at my home, they extolled the power of the Fan clan, claiming it could make the living perish and the dead live, the rich poor and the poor rich. I believed them without doubt, so I came without hesitation. Upon arrival, I took your followers’ words as truth, fearing only that my sincerity might fall short or my actions prove insufficient. I knew not where to place my body or where profit and harm lay—my heart was simply one. When things do not resist, it is like this alone.\n\nNow that I know your followers deceived me, I harbor suspicion within and display arrogance without, clinging to past luck that spared me from burning or drowning. Yet my heart seethes with distress, trembling with fear. How could I dare approach water or fire again?\n\n**Explanation:** To dive and retrieve a treasure pearl is already strange, and the Fan clan’s followers grew wary and suspicious. Only after entering and exiting the fire unscathed—no dust clinging, no body scorched—did they deem him possessed of the Dao and call him a divine person. Yet this may be like tossing an object high without a stone to strike it, or merely coinciding with circumstances by chance. Emerging from water is something even a practiced swimmer can do, but fire, raging and fierce, consumes all—whether fine or coarse, soft or hard—reducing everything to ash in its flames. Unless one’s body harmonizes with the spirit and unites with the formless, how could a mere clod of earth dare approach firewood and flame?\n\nShang Qiu Kai said he possessed no Dao, and even his own heart did not know the reason. Only by forgetting emotions and attaining non-knowledge does the heart become one and undivided—this is the Dao, and nothing can resist it. But if one harbors suspicion and displays arrogance, distress seethes within, burning inner harmony, so how could one enter fire without scorching? Trembling with fear, one’s nature is drowned within, so how could one enter water without getting wet?\n\nAfter this, when the disciples of the Fan clan encountered beggars or horse doctors on the road, they dared not insult them but would alight from their carriages to bow. **Explanation:** Though Zi Hua’s fame and power made him disdain not even beggars or horse doctors, he recognized that fame and power were not the Dao. The noble person of great virtue appears foolish, and thus forgets his own status, daring not to insult even the lowly. This is the transformation wrought by utmost sincerity.\n\nI once said that when Shang Qiu Kai was sincere toward things without a divided heart, even the purest qi of a perfected person could not surpass him. But when he harbored suspicion and displayed arrogance, he was still one of the deluded masses. From this, we know the supreme Dao does not await external seeking, nor does attainment follow gradual steps. The difference between madness and sagehood lies solely in mastering one’s thoughts—whether distraction arises even for a moment. How could one not be cautious?\n\nZai Wo heard this and told Confucius. Confucius said: “Did you not know? The person of utmost sincerity can move things, stir heaven and earth, move ghosts and spirits, traverse the six directions without resistance—how could it be merely treading peril, entering water and fire?” **Explanation:** Facing others with sincerity is but a small, unproven trust. Sincerity without expectation is the purest trust, like unalloyed gold. The person of utmost sincerity does not doubt within or without, is utterly empty and unopposed, utterly pure and unadulterated. Thus they can partake in the vastness of heaven and earth, assist in their transformative nurturing. They can journey to the lands of the southern barbarians or reach even the lowliest creatures like pigs and fish—this is what is meant by stirring heaven and earth, moving ghosts and spirits, traversing the six directions without resistance.\n\nIf Weisheng drowned or Bao Jiao burned, was that the fault of sincerity? They blocked their own paths with false trust, not the utmost sincerity. If Shang Qiu Kai did not resist even when others deceived him, how much less would he resist when both sides were sincere? Remember this, young one.\n\n**Explanation:** When sincerity resides within, even false things become true; when delusion lingers inside, even favorable circumstances remain opposed. In dealing with oneself, one must focus solely on self-sincerity, and the sage’s skill in salvation aims only at mutual sincerity between self and other. As in the *Questions of Tang*, where the seed of immortals and sages flew back and forth between the five mountains in a single day or night—was this not mutual sincerity? To tell the young one to remember this is to say the Dao in a person knows no gap between youth and age. The young one should strive—why wait to hear the great Dao late in life?\n\nAs for the one called Zi Hua, his name means “glory without substance,” so it is fitting he would use fame and power to lord over others. *Shang* (merchant) suggests the gathering of sound, *qiu* (mound) the center rising from the earth, and *kai* (open) the emergence of things—thus “Shang Qiu Kai,” one who at first could enter water and fire, but in the end declared water and fire no longer approachable.\n\nKing Xuan of Zhou had a herdsman named Liang Yang, a laborer who could raise wild birds and beasts, feeding them in the palace gardens. Even tigers, wolves, eagles, and osprey became gentle—male and female before him, breeding in groups, different species living together without attacking or biting. The king, fearing the art would die with him, ordered Mao Qiu Yuan to learn it. Liang Yang said: “I am but a lowly laborer—what art could I teach you? I fear the king will think I am hiding it from you.” So he spoke briefly of his method for raising tigers: “All things with blood and qi rejoice when followed and rage when opposed—this is their nature. But when do joy and anger arise without cause? They are always provoked by opposition. When feeding a tiger, one must not give it live prey, lest it grow angry at having to kill, nor whole prey, lest it grow angry at having to tear it apart. One must time its hunger and satiety, understand its anger, and though tigers and humans are different species, they fawn on those who nurture them—this is following. To kill them is opposition.”",

      "translated_text": "Then how could I dare oppose them to provoke their anger? Yet neither do I follow them to elicit their joy. For joy inevitably gives way to anger, and anger in turn often yields to joy—both miss the mark. Now, my heart harbors neither opposition nor compliance, so that birds and beasts regard me as one of their own. Thus, those that roam my enclosures do not long for lofty forests or vast marshes; those that rest in my courtyard do not yearn for deep mountains or secluded valleys—this is the principle at work.\n\n**Explanation:** All living things possess the nature of blood and qi. From a human perspective, blood is stored in the heart, while qi resides in the lungs; qi moves, and blood follows. In a single day and night, there are thirteen thousand five hundred breaths, with blood and qi circulating ceaselessly—awake, they course through the body; asleep, they flow through the organs. Not a hair’s breadth of delay is permitted: too much or too little, and illness arises; if severe, death follows. Thus, blood and qi may be followed but never opposed.\n\nFrom this nature of blood and qi arise the conditions of opposition and compliance, giving rise to the emotions of joy and anger. Resentment and gratitude, life and death—nothing is beyond their reach. Yet though humans cannot reverse their qi, they can command it; though they cannot defy their nature, they can regulate it—this is what makes humans possessors of the Dao. Even with the emotions of joy and anger, their expression never fails to strike the proper measure.\n\nAs for the creatures that fly and burrow, those with wings and horns, fangs and claws, that soar or crawl—knowing only the advantage of life, they are ruled by blood and qi. Thus, birds at their limit snatch, and beasts at their limit strike. To expect them to be docile among humans, living together without attacking or devouring one another—is this not difficult? Yet even tigers and wolves, eagles and ospreys—the fiercest of birds and beasts—share the same blood and qi as humans, so their minds and intelligence are not so far removed from ours. If one can understand their desires, time their hunger and satiety, indulge their compliance without violating their opposition, there is none that cannot be tamed.\n\nMoreover, to comprehend their joy and anger and indulge them—this is the art of nurturing them. But the essence of why they can stand before you, male and female, breeding in groups, different species living together without attacking or devouring one another—lies in the heart that harbors neither opposition nor compliance. Why? Understanding their joy and anger does not make them forget joy and anger. Joy and anger alternate like the movement of yin and yang: to oppose and provoke them is certainly impermissible, but to follow and indulge them is also not the mean. Though one may temporarily follow them to elicit joy, in the end, some violation will inevitably provoke their anger. Only when joy and anger do not manifest, and one harbors no opposition or compliance toward things, do things likewise harbor no opposition or compliance toward oneself. Thus, birds and beasts regard me as one of their own.\n\nThe reason birds and beasts scatter in alarm, fleeing and hiding, seeking only lofty forests, vast marshes, deep mountains, and secluded valleys is to avoid harm and remain with their kind. Now, regarding me as one of their own, they roam my gardens, rest in my courtyard, live alongside humans, walk beside them—what joy is this! Why would they seek the seclusion of mountains and forests or crave the peril of rivers and valleys? With no opposition or compliance in me, the subtlety of non-action and non-utterance silently prevails even over the fiercest of creatures. Those with horns are transformed and tamed—this may be called subtle indeed.\n\nKing Xuan of Zhou valued Liang Yang’s art and transmitted it, yet when it came to governance, he still conducted censuses of the people without applying this art—how profoundly he failed to reflect! If he had used this Dao to shepherd his people, achieving a world at ease and a society of contentment would have been effortless.\n\nAs for \"Liang Yang\": *Yang* is a paired bird, naturally docile and sociable; *Liang Yang* thus refers to one that advances and finds its place in the rafters. As for \"Mao Qiu Yuan\": *Qiu Yuan* suggests a place where feathered creatures thrive, a land of nourishment where they delight to dwell. This is why Liang Yang could raise wild birds and beasts, and why King Xuan ordered Mao Qiu Yuan to transmit his art.\n\nYan Yuan asked Confucius: “I once crossed the Shentang Abyss, where the ferryman handled the boat as if by divine skill. I asked him, ‘Can one learn to handle a boat?’ He said, ‘Yes—those who can swim can be taught. Those skilled at swimming can learn quickly. As for divers, they have never seen a boat yet handle it with ease.’ I asked him further, but he did not explain. May I ask what this means?”",

      "translated_text": "Confucius said: “Speaking of medicine, you and I have long studied its texts, yet we have not grasped its essence—shall we now discuss the Way? Those who can swim may be taught, for they are light upon the water; those skilled at swimming master it swiftly, for they have forgotten the water. As for divers, though they have never seen a boat, they handle it with ease—this is because they see the abyss as level ground, and a capsized boat as no different from a cart overturned. Though ten thousand scenes of overturning lie before them, they do not enter their minds; where could they not act with leisure?\n\nExplanation: Water bears the boat—those who learn to steer should know this fundamental principle. One may study the ferryman’s skill in handling a boat yet fail to learn what makes him a ferryman. Even the ferryman’s finest techniques can only transmit his methods, not exhaust his artistry. Those practiced in water and bold in swimming, though untrained in steering, may match the ferryman’s skill. For one unpracticed in water gazes at the river’s edge with trepidation and dread, fearing only drowning—how then could they steer a boat? Thus, those light upon the water may be taught, and those who forget the water master it swiftly. As for divers, they have never seen a boat yet handle it with ease. Never having seen a boat, they have not only forgotten the water but even the boat itself—thus they act with leisure in all things.\n\nCrossing water is like traversing peril; governing the world is like steering a boat to ferry the people to a place without difficulty. Only those who embody the Way can lightly forget worldly affairs, moving through ten thousand changes without ever being obstructed—thus they act with leisure in saving the world. Yan Hui’s use and withdrawal, action and concealment, were the same as the sage’s, so Confucius discussed the essence with him after exploring the texts.\n\nOne who pries with clay is skillful; with a hook, hesitant; with gold, dull. The skill is the same, yet attachment to externals makes one weigh them heavily. All who weigh externals neglect what lies within.\n\nExplanation: The more one values the object, the more the mind becomes constrained; a constrained mind dulls wisdom and loses skill. Skill resides within, while things lie without. Once skillful, attachment to externals makes one clumsy—why not settle the distinction between inner and outer? Treat gold as mere tile, and one will be skillful in all things, for what one values cannot then leave oneself. Yet this cannot be forced—only those who embody the Way act thus naturally.\n\nAt first, one may be skillful, but in the end, clumsy—thus skill turns to clumsiness. If one’s cunning and skill were absent, the weight of what one values would not be seen, and in handling affairs, one might not be unskillful. Then is not what the world calls skill truly great clumsiness? Thus, great skill appears as clumsiness.\n\n*Explication of the Perfect Virtue of the Dao and Its Power, Scroll Three—Concluded*\n*Explication of the Perfect Virtue of the Dao and Its Power, Scroll Four*",

(The text should read \"beneath the embankment\" rather than \"along the mulberry path.\")\n\nConfucius followed and questioned him: \"At Lüliang, the water falls thirty *ren*, its foam surges thirty *li*, a place where soft-shelled turtles, alligators, fish, and turtles cannot swim. When I saw you entering it, I thought you were in distress and wished to die, so I sent my disciples downstream to assist you. Yet you emerged with your hair unbound, singing as you swam—at first, I took you for a ghost, but upon closer inspection, you are a man. May I ask if you have a method for treading water?\"\n\nThe man replied: \"No, I have no method. I began with what was familiar, grew with my nature, and fulfilled my destiny. I enter the water with the current and emerge with its flow. I follow the Way of water without imposing my own will—this is how I swim.\"\n\nConfucius asked: \"What do you mean by beginning with what was familiar, growing with your nature, and fulfilling your destiny?\"\n\nThe man said: \"I was born on the hills and am at ease on the hills—this is what is familiar. I grew up in the water and am at ease in the water—this is my nature. I do not know why I am thus, yet I am thus—this is destiny.\"\n\n*Explication*: Creatures born in water do not struggle against its nature, just as humans are born on land and are at ease there. Yet this old man from Lüliang could swim where soft-shelled turtles, alligators, fish, and turtles could not—this was a particular ability of his nature. Only by possessing such a nature could he grow up in the water and be at ease in it. Though at ease in the water, if he did not reach the point of not knowing why he was thus, he would not yet be following the Way of water without imposing his own will, and his skill would not be so wondrous. Thus, his words ultimately speak of destiny. Such a man is like one of whom Zhuangzi spoke, who had attained the ability to roam great rivers.\n\nWhen Confucius traveled to Chu, he came upon a hunchback in the forest who caught cicadas as easily as if plucking them. Confucius said: \"You are skillful! Do you have a method?\"\n\nThe man replied: \"I do have a method.\"",

      "translated_text": "In the fifth or sixth month, when I stack two pellets and they do not fall, I miss only a few; when I stack three and they do not drop, I miss one in ten; when I stack five and they do not fall, it is as if I were gathering them by hand. My stance is like a withered tree stump; my arm, like a dead branch. Though heaven and earth are vast and the myriad things many, I know only the cicada’s wings. I do not turn aside, nor do I let the myriad things distract me from the cicada’s wings—how could I fail to catch them?\n\nConfucius turned to his disciples and said: \"When the will is undivided, it coalesces into spirit.\" Is this not what the hunchbacked elder means?\n\nThe elder said: \"You, a scholar in fine robes, what do you know of such matters? First refine what you practice, then you may speak of it.\"\n\nExplanation: To learn cicada-catching by stacking pellets—the pellet, being round, rolls and turns without fixed inclination. If one can stack them without their falling, one’s bodily stillness, the precision of one’s grip, and the undivided focus of one’s will are already evident. With such mastery, catching cicadas is as easy as plucking them. Since the cicada’s wings are light and swift, to take them so effortlessly is to advance beyond mere skill—how could this belong to the realm of cleverness? Thus he says, \"I have a method.\"\n\nWhen his stance is like a withered tree stump and his arm like a dead branch, he has inwardly forgotten himself. When he does not let the myriad things distract him from the cicada’s wings, he has outwardly forgotten all else. With both self and things forgotten, how could he fail in catching cicadas? Thus Confucius said his will was undivided, coalescing into spirit. A divided will dissipates spirit; an undivided will concentrates it—this is what is meant by \"guarding the pure qi.\" Such is the way of the hunchbacked elder, whose form was bent yet who sought no external refinement.\n\nConfucius, by contrast, wore fine robes and cultivated the conduct of a Ru scholar in Lu. Thus the elder urged him to refine what he applied in the world and set it aside before speaking of such matters.\n\nThe cicada, as a creature, shuns filth, seeks purity, sings in season, eats nothing, and makes no demands. Those who have attained the Dao of bodily transformation find in it a fitting symbol for their practice.\n\nThere was a man by the sea who loved gulls. Each morning he went to the shore, and the gulls followed him, flocking in hundreds. His father said: \"I hear the gulls all follow you—bring some back, and I will play with them.\" The next day, when he went to the shore, the gulls danced above but would not descend.\n\nThus it is said: \"The highest words abandon words; the highest action is non-action.\" The knowledge of those who rely on cleverness is shallow indeed.\n\nExplanation: The Classic says: \"Once there is a deluded mind, it startles the spirit.\" Mind and spirit are as exterior and interior. If I startle my spirit, things will startle me in return. The man by the sea followed the gulls because his mind held no resistance. Once he harbored the thought of capturing them, he startled his spirit—hence the gulls danced above and would not descend. If one does not oppose things, all things will respond likewise—why only gulls? It was only because his fondness was for gulls that the gulls followed him.\n\nThough gulls and humans are different species, when the human mind is wordless and actionless, it is closely observed by them. Then what need is there for words to be trusted or actions to be known? The knowledge of those who rely on cleverness is truly shallow.\n\nWhen Liezi offered five jugs of wine first, it startled the recipient. When Viscount Xiang of Zhao led a hundred thousand followers to hunt in Zhongshan, they set fire to the forest, fanning flames across a hundred li. A man emerged from a stone cliff, rising and falling with the smoke and embers. The crowd called him a ghostly being. When the fire passed, he walked out unhurriedly, as if untouched by what he had endured.\n\nViscount Xiang, astonished, detained him and observed him closely: his form, complexion, and seven orifices were human; his breath and voice were human. He asked: \"By what way did you dwell in stone? By what way did you enter fire?\"\n\nThe man replied: \"What do you mean by 'stone'? What do you mean by 'fire'?\"\n\nViscount Xiang said: \"What you just emerged from was stone; what you just passed through was fire.\"\n\nThe man said: \"I do not know.\"\n\nExplanation: What binds me to things, and what enables things to bind me, is the separation of form, preventing great unity. Things and I are not fundamentally different—our differences arise from knowledge and perception. Thus, knowing something as stone makes its hardness impenetrable; knowing it as fire makes its heat unapproachable. Yet the burning of fire and the hardness of stone cannot be ignored by those who are utterly without knowledge. Only when one knows through non-knowing, remaining serene and leaving no trace in the mind, do flesh and bone dissolve, merging into great unity. In great unity without self, nothing can obstruct one.\n\nHere, a man emerges from a stone cliff, rising and falling with smoke and embers. When asked about his way of dwelling in stone and entering fire, he does not know—not only does he not know the way, he has even forgotten stone and fire. This is true non-knowing. Then what can stone or fire obstruct?\n\nWhen Marquis Wen of Wei heard of this, he asked Zixia: \"What sort of man is he?\"\n\nZixia replied: \"From what I have heard of the Master’s words, one who harmonizes attains great unity with things, so that nothing can harm him. Such a one may wander through metal and stone, tread through water and fire.\"\n\nThe marquis said: \"Why do you not do this?\"\n\nZixia said: \"To hollow out the heart and discard knowledge—I have not yet attained this. Still, I can speak of it when there is leisure.\"\n\nThe marquis said: \"Why does the Master not do this?\"\n\nZixia said: \"The Master is capable of it but chooses not to.\"\n\nThe marquis was greatly pleased.",

      "translated_text": "A commentary states: When affirmation and negation complement each other, this is called harmony. To be obstructed by being is not harmony; to conceal oneself in non-being is also not harmony. For non-being is inaction and not principle, while being is obstruction and not the Dao. Only when one neither discards the function of being and non-being yet transcends both can one attain great unity with things.\n\nThis great unity means unifying through difference. When difference unifies, nothing is destroyed. The hardness of stone and the fierceness of fire cannot obstruct me. This is the Dao—what Zixia heard from the Master. Though Zixia himself has not yet hollowed out his heart and discarded knowledge, he still has leisure to speak of this. How much more so the Master?\n\nThat the Master does not practice this is not because he cannot, but because he chooses not to. Those who cannot, of course, do not practice it. But those who can yet cannot refrain from practicing it are controlled by their own ability and thus cannot truly do it. Only one who can practice yet does not, or practices without knowing why, is free from all inability.\n\nI have often reflected: The man of Zhao who entered stone and fire did so because he did not know. Yet even grasses and trees, which lack knowledge, cannot avoid being scorched or drowned in water and fire, nor obstructed by metal and stone. This is because all things are bound to the Five Phases—wood bends, water weakens, metal hardens, fire blazes, earth balances—and spread through mutual generation, completion, restraint, and control. How can they escape transformation?\n\nHumans are the spirit of the myriad things, endowed with the qi of harmonious balance. They can embody heaven and earth, yin and yang. What is called \"not knowing\" in them is not the same as the ignorance of things. By embracing harmony and guarding qi, they merge with the myriad things without perceiving difference. Then how could metal and stone, water and fire, ever obstruct their passage?\n\nLook to the creatures of the world: birds soaring in the clouds, fish lurking in the depths, insects nesting in wood, rats moving through fire—all are manifestations of yin and yang. If those who grasp only one aspect of yin and yang can do such things, how much more the sage who unifies with yin and yang, holding creation within himself? He finds fulfillment in all things without needing to act to prove it.\n\nA spirit-medium from Qi arrived in Zheng, named Ji Xian. He could foretell a person’s death or survival, fortune or misfortune, longevity or early demise, predicting the year, month, ten-day period, or day with divine accuracy. When the people of Zheng saw him, they all fled. Liezi met him and was enchanted. Returning, he told Hujiaozi: \"I once thought your Dao was supreme, but now I see there is something even greater.\"\n\nA commentary states: In ancient times, when people’s essence and spirit were undivided, gods would descend upon them. Among men, such a one was called a *wu* (medium), and if skilled in the Dao, a *shenwu* (divine medium). Named Ji Xian, he was one who had awakened to the Dao in youth. His mastery of the Dao allowed him to see clearly into others, while his youthful sensitivity left no emotion hidden. All beings confined to form are deluded by the calculations of life and death, fortune and misfortune, longevity and early demise. Yet Ji Xian could foresee these before they occurred—this is what the ignorant call the ultimate attainment.\n\nHujiaozi said: \"I have shown you the outward form of the Dao, but not its true substance. Can one truly be said to have attained the Dao if one is like a flock of hens without a rooster—how could they produce eggs? If you set the Dao against the world, you will surely be exposed. That is why he could read your fate.\"\n\nA commentary states: Form is the manifestation of affairs; substance is the reality of the Dao. To have form without substance is like having hens without a rooster—how can one lead all things and transform the myriad beings? Liezi set the Dao against the world, so his fate was certain and his exposure inevitable. Since he had grasped Hujiaozi’s outward form but not his true substance, how could he escape detection?\n\n\"Bring him to me and let him observe me.\"\n\nThe next day, Liezi brought Ji Xian to see Hujiaozi. Afterward, Ji Xian said to Liezi: \"Alas! Your master is dead. He cannot live. He will not last ten days. I saw something strange—like damp ashes.\"\n\nLiezi entered, weeping so that his tears soaked the bedding, and told Hujiaozi. Hujiaozi said: \"Earlier, I showed him the pattern of earth—stillness without movement. This is likely what Zhuangzi called the *Dudeji* (Virtue Concealed). Bring him again.\"\n\nThe next day, Liezi brought Ji Xian to see Hujiaozi again. Afterward, Ji Xian said to Liezi: \"Fortunate that your master met me! He is recovering. There is life in the ashes. I saw the *Duquan* (Virtue Balanced).\"\n\nLiezi entered and told Hujiaozi. Hujiaozi said: \"Earlier, I showed him the pattern of heaven and earth—where names and realities do not enter, yet vitality stirs from the heels. This is the *Duquan*. He likely saw the *Shanzheji* (Virtue at Ease). Bring him again.\"\n\nThe next day, Liezi brought Ji Xian to see Hujiaozi again. Afterward, Ji Xian said to Liezi: \"Your master is not in a state of fasting. I cannot read him. Let him fast, and at dawn I will observe him again.\"\n\nLiezi entered and told Hujiaozi. Hujiaozi said: \"Earlier, I showed him the *Taichong Mozhen* (Great Vacuity Without Trace). This is likely what I call the *Hengqiji* (Qi Balanced). When the *ni* fish swims in a whirlpool, it forms a deep pool; when still water swirls, it forms a deep pool; when flowing water swirls, it forms a deep pool; when overflowing water swirls, it forms a deep pool; when soaking water swirls, it forms a deep pool; when rushing water swirls, it forms a deep pool; when dammed water swirls, it forms a deep pool; when gushing water swirls, it forms a deep pool; when spring water swirls, it forms a deep pool—these are the Nine Abysses.\n\nBring him again.\"\n\nThe next day, Liezi brought Ji Xian to see Hujiaozi again.",

When I showed him heaven and earth, which incline toward yang, though name and reality did not enter, there was still an \"I\"; though the subtle stirrings of qi outwardly manifested, their rest was profound—thus he saw my virtue emerge as goodness and deemed me alive. What is called \"sealed potential\" is this: at first, he saw only the patterns of earth, unaware that these were the sealed stirrings of virtue. Only upon seeing heaven and earth did he then take those sealed stirrings as mere expedience, fitting for the moment.\n\nWhen I showed him the *Taichong Mozhen* (Great Vacuity Without Trace), perfect harmony surged forth, its bounds unfathomable; the subtle stirrings of qi remained ever-balanced, filling heaven and earth, responding to the myriad changes without ever being disturbed. His abiding in the stillness of the abyss is like the nine abysses of water—thus Ji Xian could find nothing to perceive in me. The nine abysses are the nature of water without human artifice. Though it bends or straightens with the land, takes shape with its vessel, swirls or stills, flows or overflows, rushes downward or seeps sideways, pools and returns, or bursts forth and streams away—though its waves transform ninefold—it remains ever-abyssal and self-possessed. When the Dao reaches this point, one enters the realm of neither death nor life. What Ji Xian knew was only life after birth—how could he fathom this?\n\nYet even the *Taichong Mozhen* still lodges in qi to reveal its subtleties. When I showed him what had never yet departed from my source, he became one who, though human, could act as heaven; though responding to the myriad things, remained deeply rooted in tranquil extremity. This is why Ji Xian lost himself and fled, and why Liezi could not catch up. The false before the true is like snow and frost melting at the sight of sunlight—thus he said, \"He has vanished, he is gone.\"\n\nMoreover, what had never yet departed from my source still did not leave the source, yet there was still something shown. For even the subtlest Dao does not fail to reveal itself—like sunlight shining everywhere, if the blind do not see, can the fault lie with the sun?\n\nThe one called Hujiaozi took emptiness as his essence and dwelt in a lofty central place. Dwelling in the center and on high, he seemed approachable, yet with emptiness as his essence, he never contended with the world—this is why none could fathom him.\n\nAfterward, Liezi, believing he had never yet begun to learn, returned home. For three years he did not go out, cooked for his wife, and ate gruel as if feeding others. He grew indifferent to affairs, polished no more but returned to simplicity, stood alone in his form like an uncarved block, and guarded his heart with vigilance. Thus he ended his days.\n\nThe explanation states: \"For three years he did not go out\"—he cut off from things. \"Cooked for his wife and ate gruel as if feeding others\"—he forgot himself. \"Indifferent to affairs\"—he abandoned cunning and habit. \"Polished no more but returned to simplicity, stood alone in his form\"—he returned to his mandate, reverted to constancy, and let his true singularity shine. \"Guarded his heart with vigilance\"—though the myriad changes swirled, he kept to the constant path. \"Thus he ended his days\"—this endured through ten thousand generations unchanged.\n\nLiezi advanced in this Dao, intending to show others how to return to the root—hence these words.\n\nOn his way to Qi, Liezi turned back mid-journey and encountered Bohun Maoren. Bohun Maoren asked: \"Why have you returned?\" Liezi replied: \"I was startled. Why should I be startled?\"",

      "translated_text": "\"I dined at ten porridge-stalls, yet five served me first.\" Bohun Maoren said: \"If this is so, why then are you startled?\"\n\nLiezi replied: \"When inner sincerity is not dissolved, the body’s demeanor radiates light, and this outward bearing overawes others’ hearts, making them slight the noble and the aged, and correct what troubles them. Now, these porridge-sellers merely trade in gruel for profit, with no great surplus gain; their advantage is meager, their influence slight—yet even so they act thus. How much more so with a lord of ten thousand chariots, who wearies himself for the state and exhausts his wisdom on affairs? He will entrust me with tasks and demand results from me. This is why I am startled.\"\n\nBohun Maoren explained: \"Human nature is like water: frozen, it becomes ice; melted, it returns to water. Frozen, its form does not change; melted, its use is inexhaustible. The perfected person’s heart is vast as ice about to melt, reverting to its clarity—how could it be overawed by external radiance? But if one inwardly prides oneself on true wisdom, unable to dissolve the entanglements of things, then one’s demeanor becomes twisted and gleams with false light. Others can then scrutinize it closely, and even those as slight in power and profit as porridge-sellers will slight the noble and the aged, and meddle in what troubles them. *Chì* means disorder, referring to the many troubles that arise. Qi is a central state, a place where tasks are assigned and achievements demanded. Thus Liezi, on his way to Qi, was startled by the five porridge-sellers’ precedence and turned back mid-journey.\n\nYet this startlement differs from the so-called ‘startlement at favor and disgrace.’\"\n\nBohun Maoren said: \"Excellent is your observation! If you abide in yourself, others will safeguard you.\"\n\nNot long after, when he went to visit, the shoes outside the door were filled to overflowing.\n\nBohun Maoren explained: \"To be startled by five porridge-sellers serving first is to be adept at inward observation. ‘Abiding in oneself’ means not neglecting one’s form—this is why the shoes outside the door were so many.\"\n\nBohun Maoren stood facing north, leaning heavily on his staff and pressing it against his chin. After standing thus for a while, he departed without a word. The attendant informed Liezi, who rushed barefoot, holding his shoes, and upon reaching the gate asked: \"Master, since you have come, have you not neglected your medicine?\"\n\nBohun Maoren explained: \"Standing facing north is to discern things. Leaning on his staff and pressing it to his chin is to forget himself. Departing without a word is to forget speech and discernment. Liezi, holding his shoes and rushing barefoot, has not yet silently grasped the wordless teaching; he is quick in seeking the Dao but forgets his feet. Moreover, rushing barefoot shows he has already strayed from ‘abiding in himself.’ The *Zhuangzi*’s *Virtue Complete and Perfect* repeatedly mentions the toe-less and the lame—perhaps this is akin to that.\"\n\nLiezi said: \"Enough.

      "translated_text": "You cannot make others safeguard you, yet you cannot prevent others from safeguarding you—why then this attachment to influence? Attachment breeds divergence. And if there must be influence, it unsettles your root and self—what meaning does it hold? Those who wander with you offer no true counsel; clinging to petty words poisons all. Neither awakened nor enlightened, how can they discern one another?\n\nBohun Maoren explained: One who does not lose their virtue yet has not attained the supreme virtue of non-virtue, who knows the Dao’s traces as something traversable yet has not reached the constant Dao’s effortless mind—such a one cannot prevent others from safeguarding them. And to fret over this inability to prevent safeguarding is already distinct from those who cause others to safeguard them. \"Attachment\" refers to preemptive action. Liezi never deliberately acted strangely to influence others, yet people were drawn to safeguard him—this must mean he unknowingly influenced them. Once influence takes hold, you exhaust your spirit, disturb your essence, and daily debate with those who leave their shoes at the door—what purpose does it serve? Thus it is said: unsettling your root and self holds no meaning. Those who wander with you are all mired in the exhaustion of human ways, so none can offer true counsel. Their petty chatter, though incessant, how can it serve as medicine for the ultimate teaching? In this state, they are all lost on the same path, where things and self remain unformed. Thus it is said: neither awakened nor enlightened, how can they discern one another?\n\nYang Zhu traveled south to Pei, while Lao Dan journeyed west to Qin, meeting by chance in the outskirts. By the time they reached Liang, they encountered the Old Master. Midway, the Old Master looked up to heaven and sighed: \"At first I thought you could be taught, but now you cannot.\" Yang Zhu did not respond. Upon reaching their lodging, he brought water for washing, a towel and comb, removed his shoes outside the door, and advanced on his knees, saying: \"Earlier, Master, you looked up to heaven and sighed, saying, ‘At first I thought you could be taught, but now you cannot.’ Your disciple wished to ask for your explanation, but your journey left no leisure, so I dared not. Now that you are at rest, may I inquire as to my fault?\"\n\nBohun Maoren explained: Confucius said, \"Unless one is a perfected person, one cannot humble oneself before others; and without humbling oneself, one cannot attain true understanding.\" Bringing water, washing, combing, removing shoes, and advancing on knees—all this was to seek true understanding. The Old Master said: \"Your gaze is haughty and overbearing—who could bear to dwell with you?\"\n\nBohun Maoren explained: Nothing in a person surpasses the eyes; the eyes cannot conceal their flaws, for they are separated into two orbs, the dwelling of the spirit. When those who have attained the Dao meet, their eyes meet and their intent is already conveyed. Those who know others often perceive truth in the space between brows and lashes. Thus Yang Zhu’s haughty and overbearing gaze, his improper vision, led the Old Master to deem him unteachable. Therefore, the *Book of the Yellow Emperor* says: \"The mechanism lies in the eyes.\" Utmost clarity appears as disgrace; abundant virtue seems insufficient.\n\nBohun Maoren explained: Comprehending all four directions is called utmost clarity. The more one lowers oneself, the more evident it becomes—this is what appears as disgrace. Empty yet never full, thus abundant virtue seems insufficient. One who embodies this meets others with a gaze so unassuming it seems not to see them at all—how could there be haughtiness or overbearingness? Yang Zhu, his expression suddenly transformed, said: \"I respectfully receive your instruction.\"\n\nOn his outward journey, when he stayed at an inn, the host welcomed him with the family, the master held the mat, the wife held the towel and comb, the guests yielded their seats, and those tending the stove withdrew. On his return, the inn’s guests vied with him for seats.\n\nBohun Maoren explained: Yielding a seat is not merely about non-contention. Vying for a seat is not merely about non-yielding. Upon hearing the teaching and returning, those who once yielded now contend. The distance between Qin and Liang is not great; the inn’s guests are the same as before, nor is there a second Yang Zhu. Yet their encounter changed so abruptly—one realizes then how the subtlest Dao operates in the ordinary, transforming form and altering perception, though people constantly rely on it without awareness. Traveling south to Pei, he hastened toward the convergence of things; on his return, he reverted to the root of his destiny. Whether yielding or contending depends solely on the direction of his journey.\n\nYang Zhu passed through Song and stayed at an inn on his way east. The innkeeper had two concubines—one beautiful, one ugly. The ugly one was honored, while the beautiful one was despised. Yang Zhu asked the reason. The innkeeper’s servant replied: \"The beautiful one is beautiful in her own eyes, but I do not see her beauty; the ugly one is ugly in her own eyes, but I do not see her ugliness.\" Yang Zhu said: \"Disciples, take note: act with worthiness but discard the conduct of self-regard—wherever you go, will you not be loved?\"\n\nBohun Maoren explained: Honoring the beautiful and despising the ugly stems from personal bias; honoring the ugly and despising the beautiful reflects the impartiality of the Dao. Beauty and ugliness arise from deluded perception; honoring and despising them are not true principles. What is despised in the innkeeper’s concubine is not her beauty itself, but her reliance on it to be despised. What is honored in the innkeeper is not his ability to despise beauty, but his unawareness of it. If the innkeeper’s concubine did not rely on her beauty and lacked self-regarding conduct, there would be nowhere she would not be loved. The Old Master said: \"When all under heaven know beauty as beauty, ugliness arises.\" It is not that beauty is despised, but that knowing it as beauty is despised.\n\nUnder heaven, there are ways that always prevail and ways that do not always prevail. The way that always prevails is called softness; the way that does not always prevail is called strength. Both are known, yet people do not understand them. Thus the ancients said: \"Strength first appears in those not equal to oneself; when it reaches those equal to oneself, it is perilous. Softness first emerges from oneself; it is never perilous. With this, one prevails over individuals and multitudes alike. With this, one bears the world as if bearing nothing—this is called prevailing without striving to prevail, bearing without striving to bear.\"",

      "translated_text": "Zhouzi said: \"To desire hardness, one must guard with softness; to desire strength, one must preserve with weakness. Accumulating softness yields hardness; accumulating weakness yields strength. Observe what is accumulated, and you will know the abode of fortune and misfortune. Strength prevails over those not equal to oneself, but when it reaches those equal to oneself, it is brittle. Softness prevails by emerging from oneself—its power is immeasurable.\"\n\nLao Dan said: \"When weapons are strong, they perish; when wood is strong, it breaks. The soft and weak are the companions of life; the hard and strong are the companions of death.\"\n\nExplanation: The soft and weak are the root of the Dao. Guarding the root of the Dao is nothing more than self-mastery, and thus there is nothing it does not overcome. With this, one overcomes the self; with this, one bears the world—secure and without peril, blessed and without misfortune. Though one has never sought to precede others, none can precede them. This is the way of those who skillfully nurture life, abiding as long as heaven and earth.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* says: \"Compliance is the means to exercise authority.\"\nZhuangzi says: \"In this, the fish finds its advantage.\"\nThis principle accords with the present teaching.\n\nThus, Laozi and Zhouzi, in their writings, repeatedly emphasize this intent. When they cite the words of high antiquity, it is to show that this Dao has endured since ancient times. Appearance need not be childlike for wisdom to be childlike; wisdom need not be childlike for appearance to be childlike. The sage embraces childlike wisdom and discards childlike appearance, while the multitude clings to childlike appearance and distances itself from childlike wisdom. Those whose appearance resembles their own, they draw near and love; those whose appearance differs, they distance and fear.\n\nA being with a seven-foot frame, differentiated hands and feet, hair on the head and teeth in the mouth, standing and moving—this is called a human. Yet humans are not without the hearts of beasts. Though they may possess the hearts of beasts, by appearance they are deemed kin. Creatures with wings and horns, fangs and claws spread wide, flying aloft or crouching to run—these are called birds and beasts. Yet birds and beasts are not without the hearts of humans. Though they may possess the hearts of humans, by appearance they are deemed distant.\n\nFu Xi, Nü Wa, Shennong, and the Xia sovereigns had serpent bodies and human faces, ox heads and tiger noses—these bore appearances unlike humans, yet possessed the great virtue of sages. Jie of Xia, Zhou of Yin, Duke Huan of Lu, and King Mu of Chu had the seven apertures of human features, identical to others in form, yet harbored the hearts of birds and beasts. Thus, the multitude, clinging to a single appearance in search of supreme wisdom, will never approach it.\n\nExplanation: The so-called \"appearances unlike humans\" refer to forms that closely resemble others—such as wasps with the eyes of weasels or jackals with the voices of wolves, tigers with swallow-like jaws—examples recorded in recent histories, available for verification. These words align with the marvels of creation, yet people, deluded by shallow understanding, fail to grasp the profundity of childlike wisdom.\n\nLiezi sought to clarify the ultimate Dao, and so spoke boldly, valuing only the truth of principle, heedless of the astonishment of the multitude. When the Yellow Emperor battled the Flame Emperor at the wilds of Banquan, he led bears, brown bears, wolves, leopards, lynxes, and tigers as his vanguard, while eagles, falcons, hawks, and kites served as his banners—this was commanding birds and beasts by force. When Yao entrusted Kui with music, striking and tapping stones, the hundred beasts danced in unison; when the nine movements of the *Xiaoshao* were complete, the phoenix came to pay homage—this was drawing birds and beasts by sound. If so, how do the hearts of birds and beasts differ from those of humans? Their forms and sounds differ from humans, yet people do not know the way to connect with them. The sage, knowing all and penetrating all, thus draws them forth and commands them.\n\nExplanation: Observing the nine movements of the *Xiaoshao* and the phoenix’s homage, we see that commanding birds and beasts by force is no falsehood. The wisdom of birds and beasts naturally aligns with that of humans in some respects. In ordering their lives, they do not borrow wisdom from humans: male and female pair, mother and child bond; they avoid level ground and seek perilous heights, shun cold and seek warmth; when dwelling, they form groups, when moving, they arrange in ranks; the small stay within, the strong guard without; when drinking, they lead one another, when eating, they call in flocks.\n\nIn the age of great antiquity, they dwelled alongside humans and walked among them. In the age of emperors and kings, they began to scatter in fear and confusion. By the degenerate age, they hid and fled, evading harm. Now, in the land of the Jie people to the east, there are those who frequently understand the speech of the six domestic animals—this is the achievement of partial wisdom. The divine sages of great antiquity fully knew the dispositions of all things and completely understood the sounds of different species. They gathered and assembled them, trained and instructed them, making them equal to humans. Thus, they first united with spirits and demons, then connected with the peoples of the eight directions, and finally gathered birds, beasts, insects, and moths. This shows that the hearts and minds of creatures with blood and qi are not so distant.\n\nThe divine sages, knowing this, left nothing untaught in their instruction.",

      "translated_text": "A commentary states: The stately strides of emperors and kings—whether the offices of the Yu clan or the courts of Tang and Wu—show that with each descending age, the Dao grows ever more constricted. In the time of great antiquity, birds and beasts dwelt alongside humans, walking among them without suspicion. As the ages declined and the Dao narrowed, they first grew startled and scattered, then fled and hid in concealment. That creatures of different kinds once lived and moved among humans—though this was so in the age of great antiquity—was also because the divine sages of that time had the means to gather and instruct them. Yet while the ages of past and present differ, how are the divine sages of old and present distinct? Later ages have also seen divine sages, yet we hear of none who gathered birds, beasts, insects, and moths to instruct them. Why is this? It is because the ages have declined, and creatures of different kinds, once startled, scattered, and hidden, can no longer be reassembled. Even with a sage ruler, one can only make birds, beasts, fish, and turtles docile. Thus, only when one has attained the age of a sage can one speak of the sage’s Way.\n\nIn Song there was a man called Master Ju, who loved macaques and kept them in troops. He understood their intentions, and they, in turn, grasped his. He reduced his household’s provisions to satisfy the macaques’ desires. Soon, however, he grew impoverished and sought to limit their food. Fearing the macaques would not submit, he first deceived them, saying: “Shall I give you taro—three in the morning and four at dusk—will that suffice?” The macaques all rose in anger. Then he said: “Shall I give you taro—four in the morning and three at dusk—will that suffice?” The macaques all prostrated themselves in delight. All things that are ensnared by cunning and baseness are like this. The sage, using wisdom to ensnare the multitude of fools, is no different from Master Ju using wisdom to ensnare his macaques. The name and reality remain unchanged, yet he makes them rejoice or rage at will.\n\nA commentary states: The use of joy and anger never hits the mark. Joy inevitably turns to anger, and anger invariably reverts to joy. When Master Ju allotted taro, the name and reality were not diminished. Seeking to limit their food, he made them prostrate in delight, but first had to deceive them into rising in anger—thus he ultimately achieved their joy. Had he immediately given them four in the morning and three at dusk, not only would he not have gained their joy, they would surely have risen in anger. Moreover, the macaques’ joy and anger were not feigned. The numbers three and four, whether combined or separated, still make seven. Considering the macaques’ minds, they would rather eat more in the morning and less at dusk. Thus, the abundance or scarcity in morning and dusk—how could joy and anger not be employed?\n\nIt has been said that since the Great Simplicity divided, it transformed into seven—the numbers of heaven (three) and earth (four), one odd and one even, giving birth and completing all things. Nothing escapes this number. Those who do not understand it are enslaved by it; those not deluded by it can wield it. This is not only true of the macaques’ joy and anger. The governance of hegemons through pleasure and indulgence is deemed shameful at the gates of sages because they ensnare with cunning and baseness. Not only is this true of hegemons’ governance—even the sage’s response to emperors and kings cannot escape using the world as a cage. The difference lies only in their subtle and wondrous use of numbers, hence the depth or shallowness of their governance’s effects. Pushing this to its extreme, even the transformations of heaven and earth—day and night, waking and dreaming, cold and heat, death and life—cannot alter the number of the Great Expansion’s seven times seven, leaving one void. Thus, to call the macaques’ joy and anger delusion is to call all things delusion. To deem human joy and anger correct—how can the macaques’ joy and anger alone be wrong? People laugh at the macaques ensnared by Master Ju, yet they themselves have often been in cages without realizing it and thus do not laugh—this, too, is delusion. Therefore, for humans to laugh at macaques is like the *Mencius*’s analogy of the fifty-pace soldier mocking the hundred-pace one.\n\nMoreover, the macaque is a creature skilled in its cunning, relying on its agility, and difficult to tame. Yet it is deluded by the alternating numbers of three and four and does not awaken—how much more so for other creatures? This may be why Liezi specifically took up the meaning of Master Ju’s taro allotment. Nevertheless, Master Ju, by reducing his household’s provisions to the point of poverty, had no choice but to limit the macaques’ food. From this, we know that the sage, using wisdom to ensnare the multitude of fools, does so because the ages have declined and the Dao is insufficient—is this not also a matter of necessity?\n\nMaster Jishengzi raised fighting cocks for King Xuan of Zhou. After ten days, the king asked: “Are the cocks ready to fight?” He replied: “Not yet. They are still vain and arrogant, relying on their qi.” After another ten days, the king asked again. He replied: “Not yet. They still respond to shadows.” After another ten days, the king asked again. He replied: “Not yet. They still glare fiercely and bristle with qi.” After another ten days, the king asked again. He said: “Almost. Though other cocks may crow, this one shows no change. From a distance, it resembles a wooden cock. Its virtue is complete. No other cock dares respond—it simply turns and flees.”\n\nA commentary states: The cock is a creature of wood. When wood rubs against wood, it ignites, hence the cock is a creature fond of fighting. Vanity and arrogance give it a haughty demeanor; reliance on qi gives it a domineering will. Though it has never seen another cock, it seeks opponents relentlessly. In such a state, it may be fearless, but can it be certain of victory? Thus, when asked if it was ready to fight, he said: “Not yet. It still responds to shadows.” It no longer relies on its qi but merely reacts to the direction of shadows. “It still glares fiercely and bristles with qi.” It no longer chases the delusion of shadows but merely responds to their direction. When an opponent arrives, it marshals its courage and waits. Yet its fierce glare unsettles its spirit, and its bristling qi disturbs its heart. Though it does not fight, its heart stirs within, and its spirit falters without—it merely endures without acting. Thus, he said: “Not yet.” Only when it was nearly ready...",

      "translated_text": "King Kang stamped his feet and coughed sharply, speaking rapidly: \"What pleases me are the brave and the strong—I take no delight in those who preach benevolence and righteousness. What instruction do you have for me?\"\n\nHui Ang replied: \"I possess a Way that renders men, though brave, unable to pierce with their blades, and though strong, unable to strike true. Does Your Majesty not wish to hear of it?\"\n\nThe King of Song said: \"Excellent! This is precisely what I long to hear.\"\n\nHui Ang continued: \"Yet if blades fail to pierce and strikes miss their mark, this is still a form of humiliation. I possess another Way that makes men, though brave, dare not strike, and though strong, dare not attack. This ‘daring not’ does not mean they lack the will. I possess yet another Way that eradicates their will entirely. Without will, there can be no thought of love or profit. And I possess a Way that makes every man and woman under heaven joyfully desire to love and benefit one another. This surpasses mere bravery and strength—it stands above all four burdens. Does Your Majesty not wish to hear of it?\"\n\nThe King of Song said: \"This is what I truly desire to attain.\"\n\nHui Ang replied: \"Such was the way of Confucius and Mozi. Though Confucius and Mo Di held no land as lords nor offices as ministers, every man and woman under heaven craned their necks and stood on tiptoe, yearning for their peace and benefit. Now, Your Majesty rules a realm of ten thousand chariots. If you truly embrace this will, all within your four borders will reap its benefits—your virtue will far surpass that of Confucius and Mozi.\"\n\nThe King of Song had no reply. Hui Ang bowed and withdrew.\n\nThe King then said to his attendants: \"How persuasive the guest was in convincing me!\"\n\n**Exegesis:**\nKing Kang of Song delighted in valor and strength. When Hui Ang first appeared, the king stamped his feet, coughed sharply, and spoke harshly, resenting the imposition of benevolence and righteousness. His demeanor suggested resistance. Yet Hui Ang, seizing upon the king’s fondness for strength, tailored his words to that preference, gradually advancing his argument until he arrived at the teachings of Confucius and Mozi. Had the king accepted his words, he would have contradicted his own inclinations; had he rejected them, he would have found no fault in their reasoning. Thus, after Hui Ang’s departure, the king merely remarked to his attendants on the guest’s eloquence.\n\nLet us consider this: within the realm of persuasive speech, there is no fixed right or wrong. Success makes one the head; failure, the tail. Take the likes of Zhang Yi and Su Qin, who mastered the art of vertical and horizontal alliances and roamed the Warring States. Though the lords of the six states recognized their eloquence, none could refute their arguments, trust their offices, or employ their strategies—yet they brought peace to the Central States for over a decade. What, then, is the true measure of such persuasion’s right or wrong? Even the *Liezi* is not free from rhetorical flourish; this passage merely reflects one facet of its author’s intent.\n\n**The Yellow Emperor’s Exegesis**\nZhuangzi regarded the achievements of emperors and kings as mere byproducts of the sage’s work. To call them \"byproducts\" is not to dismiss their worth but to acknowledge that the sage’s Way is vast and profound, while the deeds of emperors and kings are but chaff and dregs. For the sage is a sage precisely because of such achievements, and the world looks up to the sage because of such governance. Thus, Zhuangzi also said: \"Nothing is more divine than Heaven, nothing richer than Earth, nothing greater than emperors and kings.\" Heaven’s divinity and Earth’s abundance manifest in auspicious omens and transformations. How, then, can the sage’s stillness, which moves and penetrates the world’s affairs to respond as an emperor or king, ever be set aside? This is why the *Yellow Emperor* chapter was written.\n\nAfter the decline of the Divine Farmer, the Yellow Emperor, Yao, and Shun arose. The Dao emerged as virtue, and the august descended as emperors. The Yellow Emperor, the first of the emperors, though burdened with worldly affairs, did not yet match Yao’s magnanimity; though possessed of salvific virtue, he did not yet equal Shun’s luminous power. Yet having grasped the world’s patterns, he began to contemplate their origins—and thus arose the changes of fortune and misfortune.\n\nAt first, he rejoiced in the world’s devotion, but later grew anxious over its disorder. The five emotions roiled within, his complexion and flesh withered without. Had he not purified his mind and embodied the Dao, how could he have withstood the world’s ultimate changes, faced its greatest difficulties, and avoided the realm of misfortune, regret, and shame? Only the Yellow Emperor, by aligning his heart and form with the supreme Way, remained untouched by disgrace and harm, even as he traversed the paths of glory and peril. His governance nearly rivaled the land of Huaxu. The deeds of the divine beings of Mount Gushe mirrored the Yellow Emperor’s achievements; Liezi’s riding the wind embodied his supreme Way.\n\nThe perfected preserve pure qi; the sage conceals himself in Heaven. Shang Qiu Kai’s harmony with all things, Liang Yang’s indifference to favor or disfavor—all stem from the root of their power to inspire the myriad beings. The ferryman’s mastery of the oar, the swimmer’s dance in the rushing waters, the hunchback’s capture of cicadas, the Zhao man’s handling of stone and fire—all exemplify their resonance with the world. Through such resonance, what in the world could burden them? Through such inspiration, what among the myriad beings could disturb them? Such was the Yellow Emperor’s Way as an emperor.\n\nThus, in his discourse on the Dao, Liezi frequently cited the *Book of the Yellow Emperor* as its foundation. The chapter concluding with \"Responding to Emperors and Kings\" carries the same intent. Yet though Liezi composed the *Yellow Emperor* chapter, when he later praised the words of Yang Zhu, he claimed that the deeds of the Five Emperors were as indistinct as dreams, merging the worthy and the foolish in oblivion.",

      "translated_text": "Of its remarks on Yao and Shun, it likewise declares them to have rotted alongside Jie and Robber Zhi. For when viewed through the Dao, even the Yellow Emperor’s governance did not depart from the Way; yet when observed through the achievements of emperors and kings, the true form of the Great Dao had already receded. How fleeting were their traces of merit and fame! Why should they not move with the times and perish together? In praising the words of Yang Zhu, did he not mean to discard the Yellow Emperor’s fame and merit while preserving the Great Dao?\n\n*Explication of the Perfect Dao and Virtue, Scroll Four Concluded*\n*Explication of the Perfect Dao and Virtue, Scroll Five*\n*Presented by Your Subject Jiang Yue, Inner Student of the Hangzhou Prefectural School of the Song Dynasty*\n\n**King Mu**\n\nIn the time of King Mu of Zhou, a *huaren* arrived from the westernmost land. He entered water and fire unscathed, pierced metal and stone; he reversed mountains and rivers, shifted cities and towns. Riding the void, he did not fall; touching the solid, he met no obstacle. His transformations were boundless, inexhaustible. Having altered the forms of things, he also changed the thoughts of men. King Mu revered him as a spirit, served him as a lord, prepared an open-air lodge for his dwelling, offered the three sacrificial beasts, and selected singing girls to entertain him. The *huaren* deemed the king’s palace crude and unfit to inhabit, his kitchen fare rank and inedible, his consorts foul and unlovely.\n\nKing Mu then rebuilt for him, sparing no craft in earth and timber, adorning the structure with ochre and whitewash. The five treasuries were emptied before the terrace was completed. Towering a thousand *ren*, it overlooked the summit of Zhongnan, and was named the Terrace of Central Heaven. He selected the most graceful maidens from Zheng and Wei—lithe and supple—anointed them with fragrant oils, painted their brows, adorned them with hairpins and earrings, dressed them in fine silk, trailing skirts of white linen, powdered and rouged, girdled with jade and rings. He filled the terrace with their fragrance and played the melodies *Steaming Clouds*, *Six Radiance*, *Nine Shao*, and *Morning Dew* to delight him. Month after month, jade robes were presented; day after day, jade viands were offered. Yet the *huaren* remained unmoved. Reluctantly, he descended to receive them.\n\nBefore long, he invited the king to journey with him. The king grasped the *huaren*’s sleeve, and together they soared upward until they reached the midpoint of Central Heaven, then arrived at the *huaren*’s palace. Its halls were wrought of gold and silver, strung with pearls and jade. It rose above the clouds and rain, its foundations unseen, appearing like a mass of clouds suspended in the azure. All that the eyes beheld, the ears heard, the nose inhaled, the mouth tasted—none of it belonged to the human realm. The king truly believed it to be the Purple Tenuity of the Clear Capital, the Celestial Vault of Broad Music, the abode of the Emperor on High.\n\nWhen the king looked down, the palaces below seemed but heaps of earth and piles of brushwood. He had lived there for decades without a thought for his kingdom.\n\n**Explication:**\nThe distance between what lies beyond the world and what lies within it is vast indeed. King Mu dwelt within the world; the *huaren* came from beyond it. The West governs metal, and metal is malleable—thus the *huaren* necessarily arrived from the westernmost land. Things fundamentally have no fixed form; the *huaren*, as master of creation, originates from the Great Void. Neither the six directions nor the five phases could restrain him. Thus he could gather heaven and earth within a millet grain or compress an eon into a single moment, with boundless room to spare. Entering water and fire, piercing metal and stone, reversing mountains and rivers, shifting cities and towns, altering the forms of things, changing the thoughts of men—these were but trivial matters to him.\n\nKing Mu, in his dotage, saw all things as sentient. His mind was not empty, so he was astonished by wonders and revered the *huaren* as a spirit, serving him as a lord. He exposed his bedding to the open air, offered the three sacrificial beasts, and selected singing girls, hoping to please him—yet he did not understand that what the *huaren* delighted in was true joy, which is joy without joy. Instead, he deemed the king’s offerings crude and foul, bowing his head in disdain without a glance.\n\nThe king then built the Terrace of Central Heaven atop Zhongnan, a thousand *ren* high, and filled it with maidens from Zheng and Wei. He played *Steaming Clouds*, *Six Radiance*, *Nine Shao*, and *Morning Dew* to entertain him, presented jade robes, and offered jade viands—yet he did not grasp that the *huaren* dwelt in no dwelling, savored no flavors, perceived no colors, heard no sounds. How could he take pleasure in what pleased men?\n\nSeeing the king’s earnest and reverent heart, the *huaren* deemed him teachable, though not yet ready to ascend to the highest Dao. He tested him by gradually guiding him into the lesser vehicle, taking his sleeve to journey together. They ascended halfway to Central Heaven, arriving at the *huaren*’s palace, wrought of gold and silver, strung with pearls and jade. It floated beyond the clouds, with nothing above to grasp or below to support it, like a mass of clouds suspended in the azure, never falling.\n\nAll that the eyes beheld, the ears heard, the nose inhaled, the mouth tasted—none of it existed in the mortal world. The king believed it to be the Purple Tenuity of the Clear Capital, the Celestial Vault of Broad Music, the palace of the Emperor on High. Yet when he looked down from above, he saw that his former palaces were but heaps of earth and piles of brushwood—no different from the nests of bees or ants. Thus he abandoned the base and foul, seeking the lofty and pure, unwilling to return to his former capital. He lingered there for decades.\n\nAlas! King Mu was once a companion of the Cinnabar Terrace, exiled to the mortal realm. The dust of the world had not yet deeply stained him, so he could dwell in the sacred realm. Even this lesser abode—could those born of flesh ever reach it? Even if they could, their souls would tremble and their spirits scatter, and they would seek to return.\n\nThe *huaren* again invited the king to journey with him. Wherever they went, he could neither see the sun and moon above nor the rivers and seas below. The play of light dazzled his eyes, and he could not see; the sounds assailed his ears, and he could not hear. His limbs and organs quaked, his mind wandered, his essence fled. He begged the *huaren* to let him return.",
      "overlap_context": "beings could disturb them? Such was the Yellow Emperor’s Way as an emperor.\n\nThus, in his discourse on the Dao, Liezi frequently cited the *Book of the Yellow Emperor* as its foundation. The chapter concluding with \"Responding to Emperors and Kings\" carries the same intent. Yet though Liezi composed the *Yellow Emperor* chapter, when he later praised the words of Yang Zhu, he claimed that the deeds of the Five Emperors were as indistinct as dreams, merging the worthy and the foolish in oblivion.",

      "translated_text": "The *huaren* transported him, and the king fell as though into the void.\n\nWhen he awoke, he was still seated where he had been before, and his attendants remained as they were. Before him, the wine had not yet cleared, nor had the dishes spoiled. The king asked where he had come from, and his attendants replied, \"Your Majesty merely entered stillness.\"\n\nFrom this, King Mu remained disoriented for three months before recovering. He questioned the *huaren* again, who said, \"I journeyed with Your Majesty in spirit—how could your form have moved? Moreover, where we dwelled before—was it not your palace? Where we wandered—was it not your garden? What you deemed extraordinary was but a fleeting lapse in your usual state. At the extremes of transformation, in the space between swift and slow, can all be grasped?\"\n\nThe king was overjoyed. He neglected state affairs, took no pleasure in his ministers or concubines, and indulged in distant travels. He commanded his chariot drawn by the Eight Steeds: on the right rein, *Lai* and *Liu*, and on the left, *Lü’er*; on the right trace, *Chiji*, and on the left, *Baiyi*. The charioteer was Zaofu, with *Yi* as his right-hand guard. The second chariot bore on its right rein *Quhuang* and on its left *Yulun*, with *Daoli* on the left trace and *Shanzi* on the right. The charioteer was Boyao, with Sanbai driving and Benrong as his guard.\n\nThey galloped a thousand *li* to the land of the Giant Sou clan. The Giant Sou presented the king with white crane’s blood to drink and offered the milk of cows and horses to wash his feet, as well as those of his two charioteers. After drinking, they departed and lodged at the slopes of Kunlun, on the sunny side of the Red Water. The next day, they ascended Kunlun’s peak to behold the palace of the Yellow Emperor and sealed it to bequeath to later generations. Then they were received as guests by the Queen Mother of the West, who feasted with the king upon the Jasper Pool. The Queen Mother sang for the king, and he harmonized with her—her song was mournful.\n\nThere, he beheld the place where the sun sets. In a single day, they traveled ten thousand *li*, and the king sighed, saying, \"Alas! I, alone, am not replete in virtue yet am content in pleasure. Will later generations recount my faults?\" King Mu was nearly a divine being—able to exhaust the joys of his lifetime, as though he had ascended in a hundred years.\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe Way of the *huaren* is endlessly transformative, yet it does not depart from the One. Only those who attain this ultimate Oneness can truly realize the Way, leaping in an instant into the realm of nothingness. For gradual learners, their capacity is not yet ready to be instructed in the supreme Way of the sages. Thus, the *huaren* provisionally displayed the transformations of the middle heavens, allowing the king to witness the insubstantiality of the human world, to recognize the weariness of worldly burdens, and to forget his kingdom—only then did he reveal the true realm of the supreme Way.\n\nWhere he looked up and saw no sun or moon, height was insufficient to describe it; where he looked down and saw no rivers or seas, depth was insufficient to name it. The radiance that dazzled his eyes—his vision was confounded and could not see—yet the light of heaven arises within, to be perceived by spirit, not by the eyes. The sounds that assailed his ears—his hearing was overwhelmed and could not listen—yet the music of heaven resounds of itself, to be heard by *qi*, not by the ears. Thus, beholding the *huaren*’s palace was like gazing upon one’s own kingdom from the middle heavens.\n\nKing Mu was not yet ready to advance further, so his heart was unmoored, his spirit scattered, his mind bewildered, his essence lost—he begged the *huaren* to let him return. When the *huaren* again invited the king to journey with him, the places they reached were no different from the middle heavens, yet his perceptions were so altered. For the wondrous Way abides not apart from the present place, leaping beyond all existence. It was not merely unlike the *huaren*’s palace—where he dwelled, where he wandered, was no different from the king’s own palace or garden.\n\nFrom this, we know that the distinction between the mad and the sage lies in name alone, not in reality; people are deluded, but the Way is not. It is like journeying in spirit while the form remains unmoved. When the *huaren* came from the western extremity, did he seek to display marvels and astonish the vulgar? No—his aim was to guide all people toward the wondrous Way. Had King Mu first awakened to the Way, the governance of the Yellow Emperor and the land of Huaxu might have been within reach—how could it have been merely his own amusement?\n\nWhen King Mu emptied his five organs to serve the *huaren*, the *huaren* still did not rejoice. Did the *huaren* truly delight in the pleasures of sound, form, scent, or taste? No—he wished the king to awaken through these to the joylessness of worldly pleasures. Failing that, the *huaren* journeyed with him in spirit, displaying illusions to reveal the spontaneous arising and vanishing of transformations, that he might awaken to the natural principle of the spirit. Yet the king mistook these provisional displays for the Purple Tenuity of the Clear Capital and the grand music of the Highest Heaven, taking them as true delights—this was even further from the mark.\n\nWhen the *huaren* again invited the king to journey with him, he revealed the true realm of the Way. Yet King Mu could not advance further; he begged the *huaren* to let him return. Why? The practice of the wondrous Way transcends form and body—how could one who has not attained the Way or realized its principle dwell in its domain? The *huaren* knew he would never awaken, so when the king sought to return, he did not stop him.\n\nNevertheless, when the *huaren* transported him, the king fell as though into the void—this too was a means to awaken him. Yet King Mu ultimately did not awaken. Thus, upon waking, he remained disoriented for three months. However, from this he recovered, questioned the *huaren* again, and was told of the principle of spiritual wandering. Only then did he begin to grasp the principle of transformation and rejoice.\n\nThereafter, he neglected state affairs and abandoned worldly concerns, took no pleasure in his ministers or concubines and distanced himself from others, indulged his desires without restraint, and wandered far without limit. Commanding his chariot drawn by the Eight Steeds, he galloped without bound. Charioteers like Zaofu, unparalleled in their generation, and the Eight Steeds, not of ordinary stock—traveling ten thousand *li* in a single day—how could the flight of wind and clouds compare to their swiftness?",

      "translated_text": "Galloping a thousand *li*, he arrived at the land of Minister Sou. *Sou* means \"to select,\" for he was still galloping and choosing his direction. The white crane is a creature of purity, soaring high; oxen and horses are beasts that bear heavy burdens and travel far. Offering the blood of a white crane for the king to drink was meant to alter his thoughts and urge him toward loftiness. Preparing the fresh milk of oxen and horses to wash the king’s feet was to cleanse his form and enable him to journey afar.\n\nKunlun is the mountain of the westernmost reaches. To call it Kunlun is to liken it to the Dao’s soaring brilliance and primordial vastness. North of the Red Water—*yang* containing *yin*—is the image of the mysterious and wondrous. At first, he reached the land of the Great Sou, but passed through without lingering. Lodging at the foothills of Kunlun and north of the Red Water, he merely sojourned briefly without staying long. On another day, he ascended Kunlun’s peak—this was progress in the Dao.\n\n*Zhuangzi* speaks of Zhili Shu observing the hills of Mingbo, where the ruins of Kunlun served as the Yellow Emperor’s resting place. It tells how the Yellow Emperor, gazing south from Kunlun’s peak, returned only to lose his dark pearl—thus the symbolic significance of Kunlun as the Dao is clear. If King Mu could ascend Kunlun’s peak, then his unrestrained wanderings indeed reached far. Yet his travels could not dispense with chariots and horses, unlike the spirit-wandering of the *huaren*. Thus, though he traveled ten thousand *li* in a day, his journey remained measurable in time. Though he entered the westernmost reaches, he never surpassed Kunlun. He did not roam the Great Void and could not reach the land from which the *huaren* came.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor was a sage of the highest order, yet even when he sealed himself in his palace, none could see him. The Queen Mother of the West, a lineage of immortals and sages, though not bound by worldly rule, received him as a guest. They raised cups to each other at Yaochi, and she sang to him—surely he could have become intoxicated with the Dao and attained its joy. Yet King Mu’s harmonizing song was mournful, for he could only exhaust the pleasures of his own lifetime and did not attain the celestial joy.\n\nObserving where the sun sets—the sun being a metaphor for the Dao—*Zhuangzi* describes the ten suns rising together, illuminating all things, as the flourishing of virtue. Thus, the sun’s setting in the westernmost reaches may symbolize the sage gathering the Dao and returning to the great origin and primordial source. Yet merely observing where the sun sets is only observation, not the attainment of the Dao. Thus, in the end, he sighed that his virtue was not full and his joy not complete.\n\n*The Book of Zhou* records that he lived to a hundred, senile and dissolute—this is how later generations tallied his faults. Yet he exhausted the joys of his own lifetime and attained the great fast of longevity, which is what the world calls \"ascending to the Dao through refinement.\" Thus, when later scholars examined the bamboo slips gnawed by bookworms, searched the stone chambers, and consulted *The Golden Cord*, *The Classic of Mountains*, *The Approaching Elegance*, and *The Great Commentary*, all recorded his tale.\n\nI have said that the Yellow Emperor’s dream was a spirit-journey, and King Mu’s transformation was also a spirit-wandering—they were equal in their dreamlike nature. Yet their effects on governance differed: the Yellow Emperor’s dream arose from fasting the mind and disciplining the form, while King Mu’s transformation was merely a change wrought by the *huaren*. Moreover, the Yellow Emperor awoke naturally, whereas King Mu, unable to do so, had to ask the *huaren* to return. This is why the Yellow Emperor, upon waking, was content and at ease, achieving the governance of Huaxu, while King Mu, upon waking, remained disoriented for three months and could only exhaust the pleasures of his own lifetime.\n\nLao Chengzi studied illusion under Master Yin Wen for three years, yet was not taught anything. Lao Chengzi asked to be told his faults and sought to leave. Master Yin Wen bowed and led him into a chamber, dismissed his attendants, and spoke to him, explaining: \"To desire to study illusion is to wish to use illusion to return and learn from illusion. After three years, could the extremes of transformation and illusion be fully imitated? Not teaching you the art for three years was itself the teaching.\"\n\nLao Chengzi could not fathom the principle of unspoken delight and instead asked to be told his faults and leave. Thus, Master Yin Wen had no choice but to speak to him, bowing and leading him into the chamber. The Dao is profound, so he dismissed his attendants to speak privately—those not meant to know were kept from seeing or hearing. Lao Chengzi was one who heard the great Dao late in life yet achieved mastery, so though he initially asked to be told his faults and leave, he ultimately transmitted the art. Master Yin Wen had inwardly attained the Dao and displayed this refinement to guide the masses, which is why Lao Chengzi studied under him.\n\nHe said: \"When Lao Dan departed for the west, he turned to me and said: 'The *qi* of living beings, the forms of material things—all are illusion. What the Creator begins, what *yin* and *yang* transform, is called life and death. Exhausting the numbers and grasping change, following form to shift—this is called transformation, called illusion. The Creator’s skill is subtle, its work profound, inherently difficult to exhaust or complete. Following form, its skill is manifest, its work shallow, thus it arises and vanishes in an instant. Only when you understand that illusion and transformation are no different from life and death can you begin to study illusion. You and I are also illusion—what need is there to study?'\"\n\nThe explanation: Life, death, transformation, and illusion—when discussed in general terms—are like a body’s shadow, like bubbles on water, like dew on garlic chives, like lightning’s flash: all are illusion. The subtle and profound, difficult to exhaust or complete, are called life and death. The manifest and shallow, arising and vanishing in an instant, are called transformation and illusion. To call them so is to name them based on their function. Thus, though their subtlety differs, their skill is the same; though their depth varies, their work is equal.\"",

Only when you know that transformation and illusion are no different from life and death can life and death no longer be considered great.

Thus, those who study illusion must base themselves on knowing illusion.\n\nYet knowing does not depart from awareness. To speak of the aware is not to depart from the realm of illusion, and even the unaware do not depart from illusion.

      "translated_text": "Throughout his life, he never clung to his arts, and thus the world never transmitted them.\n\n**Explanation:** That which adheres to form is never free from illusion. Though the workings of creation are wondrous, they do not depart from illusion. The illusions of creation arise constantly through human agency; the illusions of human agency, in turn, depend on heavenly principle. The illusions of creation do not depart from yin and yang; the transformations of humans do not depart from numerical change. Governed by yin and yang, even the real becomes illusion; exhausting numerical change, even illusion awakens. Awakening lies within the self—how could illusion belong to another? Once one attains this Dao, one not only illudes things without being illuded by them, but can also command the seasons to shift, conjure thunder in winter and ice in summer, reverse the flight of birds and the gait of beasts, and seize the illusions of creation itself.\n\nYet what, after all, gives rise to illusion? Fundamentally, it arises from the wondrous mind, which generates its substance—just as flowers in the sky emerge from emptiness. Though the substance of illusion appears, its principle remains wondrous. Appearance gives rise to illusion; wonder enables it. Only through appearance can it be spoken of; only through wonder must one ponder deeply for three months before attaining the Dao.\n\nMoreover, those of old who studied illusion did not do so to astonish the vulgar. Their study aimed to awaken to the Dao through illusion. Thus, when speaking of their ability to illude, flight and gait could be reversed, thunder and ice could be summoned. Yet once they attained the Dao, they never clung to their arts throughout their lives, and so the world never transmitted them.\n\nAlas! The wonder of transformation is such that even Master Yinwen did not presume to claim the Dao as his own, merely citing the words of the Old Master as he departed westward.\n\nMaster Liezi said: *\"Those skilled in transformation keep their Dao hidden and ordinary, their achievements indistinguishable from others. The virtue of the Five Emperors and the accomplishments of the Three Kings were not necessarily the result of wisdom or courage alone—some arose through transformation. Who can fathom this?\"*\n\n**Explanation:** What makes heaven and earth heaven and earth is their transformation of the myriad things. What makes the sage a sage is their awakening to the Dao of transformation. The illusions of heaven and earth—yin and yang alternating, cold and heat measured—cause the myriad things to follow their Dao and attain their proper place, without boasting of commanding the seasons as an achievement. If heaven and earth were to illude by summoning thunder in winter and ice in summer, no living thing would survive. Thus, those skilled in transformation—why would they display marvels or strive to astonish the senses? Therefore, the sage’s transformations, though hidden and ordinary, cannot be swiftly discerned in their effects, yet they remain no different from others. This is why Master Laochengzi, though capable of illusion, never clung to his arts throughout his life. Confucius could have done the same but chose not to—this is the same Dao. The Five Emperors and Three Kings were all sages of old; whether yielding or contending, they adapted to their times. Though they displayed wisdom and courage, their silent, wordless wonder worked unseen. People could witness their achievements but could not fathom how they transformed—this is beyond the governance of emperors and kings.\n\n**Awakening has eight signs; dreams have six conditions.**\n\nWhat are the eight signs?\n1. The familiar,\n2. The intentional,\n3. The attained,\n4. The lost,\n5. Sorrow,\n6. Joy,\n7. Life,\n8. Death.\nThese eight signs are what form encounters.\n\nWhat are the six conditions?\n1. Ordinary dreams,\n2. Troubled dreams,\n3. Thoughtful dreams,\n4. Waking dreams,\n5. Joyful dreams,\n6. Fearful dreams.\nThese six arise from the interplay of spirit.\n\n**Explanation:** The signs of awakening and the conditions of dreams, though encountered by spirit and form, do not share a single principle. Fundamentally, they arise from the mind’s own creation. Those who do not recognize the origin of sensory change are perplexed when events arise; those who recognize it understand their cause. Understanding their cause, they are free from distress.\n\n**Explanation:** The origin of sensory change does not exceed the signs of awakening and the conditions of dreams—this is the constant principle. Recognizing their cause and remaining free from distress, how much more so for those who know the Dao? Those who know the Dao see life and death as no different from themselves; their view of dreams and awakening is but a trifle.\n\nThe waxing and waning, ebb and flow of this single body all correspond to heaven and earth and respond to the kinds of things. Thus, when yin qi is strong, one dreams of wading through great waters in terror; when yang qi is strong, one dreams of traversing great fires and burning. When both yin and yang are strong, one dreams of life and death. When overly sated, one dreams of giving; when overly hungry, one dreams of taking. Those afflicted by floating emptiness dream of soaring; those afflicted by sinking solidity dream of drowning. Sleeping with a belt beneath one dreams of snakes; birds perching on one’s hair cause one to dream of flying. When yin prevails, one dreams of fire; when illness approaches, one dreams of eating. Those who drink wine dream of sorrow; those who sing and dance dream of weeping.\n\n**Explanation:** Dreams are encounters of the spirit. The Dao of the supreme spirit is unfathomable by yin and yang, and since none can fathom it, none can control it. The human spirit gathers through essence, dwelling within the body, dependent on yin and yang. Bound to them, it is inevitably enslaved by them. Thus, the waxing and waning, ebb and flow of this single body—its spirit’s encounters become dreams, corresponding to heaven and earth, responding to the kinds of things, with no escape. Therefore, dreaming of wading through great waters or traversing great fires is governed by the strength of qi. Dreaming of giving when sated or taking when hungry is driven by desire. Dreaming of soaring or drowning is the spirit being gnawed by illness. Dreaming of snakes or flying is the spirit being stirred by the kinds of things. Dreaming of fire when yin prevails or of eating when illness approaches—such are the inversions of dream-thought. Dreaming of sorrow after drinking or weeping after singing and dancing—such are the alternations of sorrow and joy.",

If even for a moment it fails to preserve its pure qi, then with the waxing and waning of time, the interplay of yin and yang, and the myriad things of day and night, it becomes besieged. The form toils without rest, the spirit dissipates without cease, and one spends a lifetime in ceaseless labor, transforming alongside the things of the world—how can one fail to awaken?\n\nI have examined the principles of dreaming and waking, the constancy of night and day. What appears in dreams, though called an encounter of the spirit, is in truth the servitude of the form. If the form enslaves me, it is not that the form has the power to enslave, but that I enslave myself. By my own enslavement to the form, the form in turn enslaves me, and I, subjected to its servitude, cannot master it.\n\nWhen dreaming, one does not know it is a dream; upon waking, one recognizes the dream, yet soon dreams again, still believing it to be waking.

Thus, daytime thoughts give rise to nighttime dreams—these are encounters of spirit and form. Therefore, when the spirit is concentrated, thoughts and dreams naturally dissipate. One who trusts waking cannot speak of the Dao; one who trusts dreams cannot be called enlightened—these are but the comings and goings of the transformations of things.\"\n\nThe men of old who were true persons forgot themselves in waking and slept without dreaming—how could this be mere empty words?\n\n**Explication:**\nDaytime thoughts and nighttime dreams—dreams arise from the mingling of the hun-souls, while waking is the unfolding of form. Day and night alternate in their course, the transformations of things coming and going like flowers in empty space, arising and vanishing in an instant. Thus, one who trusts waking cannot speak of the Dao, and one who trusts dreams cannot be called enlightened.\n\nYet though spirit and form encounter things, when one examines their origin, all is self-created. The inversions of thoughts and dreams, and the self-generated nature of thoughts and dreams—there is no other cause; it lies solely in whether the celestial spirit is concentrated or not.\n\nThe so-called true person does not depart from essence, for their spirit is concentrated. They do not delight in life nor detest death; their going forth brings no joy, their return no resistance. They do not discard the Dao with the heart, nor do they aid Heaven with human effort. They come and go with ease, unshaken by the transformations of things, and hold no trust in either dreams or waking. Thus, they forget themselves in waking and sleep without dreaming.\n\nAt the southwestern corner of the Western Limits lies a country whose borders are unknown, called the Land of Ancient Wilderness. The qi of yin and yang do not intersect there, so cold and heat are indistinguishable; the light of sun and moon does not reach it, so day and night are undifferentiated. Its people neither eat nor wear clothing but sleep often, waking once every fifty days. To them, what they do in dreams is real, while what they see in waking is illusory.\n\nThe Central Kingdom, equidistant from the four seas, spans north and south of the Yellow River and east and west of Mount Tai, extending over ten thousand li. Its yin and yang are measured precisely, so there is one cold and one heat; its divisions of dusk and dawn are clear, so there is one day and one night. Its people range from wise to foolish, its myriad things flourish, and its skills and arts are manifold. There are rulers and subjects, rites and laws. Their deeds are beyond counting. They regard what they do in waking as real and what they see in dreams as illusory.\n\nAt the northeastern corner of the Eastern Limits lies a country called the Land of Flourishing Settlements. Its earth is perpetually warm, and though the lingering light of sun and moon shines upon it, no fine crops grow there. Its people eat grass roots and tree fruits, knowing nothing of cooked food. Their natures are fierce and unyielding; the strong oppress the weak, valuing victory over righteousness. They run swiftly and rest little, remaining awake without sleep.\n\n**Explication:**\nThe southwestern corner of the Western Limits is the direction of Kun and Dui. All things follow Kun’s labor and tend toward Dui’s joy and rest, so in that land, what is done in dreams is considered real. It is called the Land of Ancient Wilderness, for its Dao is vast and boundless, existing since antiquity—this is the nature of the southwest.\n\nThe northeastern corner of the Eastern Limits is the direction of Gen and Zhen. All things follow Gen’s paths to reach Zhen’s great thoroughfares, soon to advance toward Li’s mutual manifestation. Thus, its customs favor waking and eschew sleep. It is called the Land of Flourishing Settlements because things there grow abundantly and gather in communities—this is the nature of the northeast.\n\nIn the Central Kingdom, yin and yang are measured precisely, so there is one day and one night, one cold and one heat. They regard waking as real and dreams as illusory, yet none can escape the changes of yin and yang.\n\nIn the time of the Zhou, the House of Yin greatly expanded its wealth. Those who served beneath them toiled from dawn to dusk without rest. There was an old laborer whose strength was exhausted, yet he was pressed to work even harder. By day, he groaned as he toiled; by night, he sank into deep sleep, his spirit scattered and lost. Every night, he dreamed he was a lord, ruling over the people, managing the affairs of the state, wandering through palaces and gardens, indulging every desire—his joy was unmatched. Upon waking, he returned to his labors.\n\nWhen others consoled him for his toil, the laborer said: \"A human life spans a hundred years, divided equally between day and night. By day, I am a servant, and though it is bitter, it is bitter indeed; by night, I am a lord, and my joy is unmatched. What cause have I for complaint?\"\n\nThe House of Yin was consumed by worldly affairs, its thoughts fixed on family wealth. Both mind and body were exhausted, and at night, it too sank into deep sleep. In dreams, it became a servant, running errands and performing every task, enduring scoldings and beatings without end. In sleep, it muttered and groaned until dawn.\n\nDistressed, the House of Yin sought counsel from a friend. The friend said: \"Your position brings honor, and your wealth is abundant—you surpass others by far. Yet to dream of being a servant is but the natural alternation of hardship and ease. How could you hope to have both waking and dreaming as you wish?\"\n\nUpon hearing this, the House of Yin eased the laborer’s workload and reduced its own burdensome thoughts. Its illness gradually abated.\n\n**Explication:**\nDay and night are divided, with form and spirit alternating in use. When the spirit labors by day, the body rests, so by night, the spirit rests while the body labors. When the body labors by day, the spirit rests, so by night, the spirit labors while the body rests. This is the Dao of yin and yang’s waxing and waning, of things reaching their extreme and then reversing.\n\nThus, the House of Yin and its servant experienced the alternation of hardship and ease, unable to have both in waking and dreaming. The ignorant, failing to understand the principle of fullness and emptiness, trust waking as real and dismiss dreams as illusory. They pursue the gains and losses of the day but pay no heed to the joys and sorrows of dreams. Little do they realize that if dreams were without awareness, it would be well, but if dreams *are* aware, then sorrow and joy, desire and aversion are no different from waking—how then can they be dismissed as illusory?\n\nThat the House of Yin recognized this as an illness and sought counsel from a friend was perhaps because the spirit had already received its warning.",

      "translated_text": "As for easing the labor of one’s servants and reducing one’s own burdens of thought, if the illness finds even slight respite, then the principle may indeed be trusted. But if one truly ceases to weary the self, diminishing thoughts layer by layer, then the spirit may congeal, and dream-visions dissolve—how could this merely bring slight respite to the illness?\n\nThere was a man of Zheng who gathered firewood in the wilds when he encountered a startled deer. He chased it down and struck it dead. Fearing others would see, he hastily concealed it in a ditch, covering it with plantain leaves, overcome with joy. Soon after, he forgot where he had hidden it and took it all for a dream. As he walked along, he hummed of the affair. A passerby heard him, followed his words, and took the deer. Upon returning home, he told his wife, “A firewood-gatherer dreamed he had caught a deer but forgot where it was. Now I have it—he was truly dreaming!” His wife said, “Is it not you who dreamed of the firewood-gatherer catching the deer? Was there ever a firewood-gatherer? Now that you truly have the deer, is your dream not real?” The man replied, “I have the deer in hand—why trouble myself over whether he dreamed or I dreamed?”\n\nThe firewood-gatherer returned, vexed at losing the deer. That night, he truly dreamed of the hiding place and of the one who had taken it. At dawn, he followed his dream and found it. They took their dispute to court, where the magistrate ruled: “You first truly caught the deer but falsely called it a dream; now you truly dreamed of the deer but falsely call it real. He truly took your deer, yet you dispute it with him. Your wife claims both dreamed of the deer, so no one truly has it. Since the deer is now here, let it be divided in two.” He reported this to the lord of Zheng, who exclaimed, “Ah! Is the magistrate about to dream of dividing another’s deer?” He consulted his prime minister, who said, “Dream or not—a matter I cannot discern. To distinguish waking from dreaming, only the Yellow Emperor or Confucius could do so. Now that they are gone, who can decide? Yet perhaps the magistrate’s words may suffice.”\n\nThe explanation: It is human nature to trust waking as real, for it is what the body touches, and to dismiss dreams as illusory, for they are but the wanderings of the soul. Yet if one forgets what one does while awake, is this not akin to dreaming? And if what one encounters in dreams proves real, is this not akin to waking? For waking acts often stem from intention, so the spirit easily forgets them; but dreams may arise without intent, so the spirit remains sharp. In essence, dreaming and waking are not two different things—obscure them, and both are real; scrutinize them, and both are illusory. If one insists dreams are real, then while dreaming, why does one not know it is a dream? If one insists waking is real, then once awake, why does one still have dreams?\n\nThis man lived in the central kingdom, so he distinguished dreaming and waking thus. Had one spoken of this principle to the ancient tribes of the wilds, their judgments would surely differ. The firewood-gatherer of Zheng first took reality for a dream, then took a dream for reality. The one who took the deer followed his words and treated it as a dream, yet claimed the deer and disputed it. Dream and waking intertwined, truth and falsehood raced, right and wrong clashed—hence the lawsuit. The magistrate, who adjudicates disputes, faced a dilemma: if he sided with the taker, the deer originally belonged to the firewood-gatherer; if he sided with the gatherer, the taker had followed the dream to find it. Since it all arose from a dream, right and wrong were tangled, with no clear resolution. To divide the deer in two—how could this be a just verdict? This is why the lord of Zheng sighed and consulted his prime minister.\n\nYet the principle of waking and dreaming divides day and night equally. Trusting waking alone leaves one mute; trusting dreams alone leaves one lost. Only the Yellow Emperor and Confucius could discern the truth—without them, how could right and wrong be swiftly decided? Thus, though the magistrate’s division of the deer was a last resort, in the end, he neither trusted nor distrusted waking or dreaming—he trusted nothing, yet trusted all. Though he did not reach the point where dream-visions dissolve, he may be said to have borne the burden well. And was not the magistrate’s judgment, after all, acceptable?\n\nThe magistrate represents the law. Where there are forms and evidence, and the law must decide, right and wrong become tangled, with no clear answer. One can only act as circumstances permit—is this not acceptable when no better course exists?\n\nIn the Yang district of Song, there was a man named Hua Zi who, in middle age, suffered from forgetfulness. What he took in the morning he forgot by evening; what he received at dusk he forgot by dawn. On the road, he forgot to walk; at home, he forgot to sit. He did not recognize what came before or after. His household was distressed. They exhausted divination and sought omens, but to no avail.",

      "translated_text": "They sought out shamans to pray for him, but the condition remained; they consulted physicians to treat him, but it did not cease. In Lu there was a Confucian scholar who offered his services, claiming he could cure Hua Zi. His wife and children offered half their property in exchange for the remedy. The scholar said: \"This is not a matter for divination or omens, nor for prayers or supplications, nor for medicine or stone needles. Let me attempt to transform his heart and alter his thoughts—perhaps then he may recover.\"\n\nThereupon, they exposed him to the elements so that he sought clothing; they starved him so that he sought food; they confined him in darkness so that he sought light. The scholar joyfully told Hua Zi’s son: \"The illness can be cured. However, my method is secret and not to be passed down to others. Let me send away all attendants and remain alone with him in seclusion for seven days.\" They complied. None knew what he did, yet an affliction of many years vanished in a single morning.\n\nThe explanation states: When principles are entangled with falsehood, divination may be consulted; when matters are bound to profit and harm, prayers may be offered; when illness arises from indulgence, medicine may be applied. But the malady of forgetfulness is so vast that one is unaware of the existence of heaven and earth—how could divination, prayers, or medicine cure it? Exposing him to seek clothing shows he had not forgotten cold and heat; starving him to seek food shows he had not forgotten the body; confining him in darkness to seek light shows he had not forgotten likes and dislikes. Thus, Hua Zi’s forgetfulness was merely an obstruction caused by illness, not true oblivion of worldly affairs. Therefore, the scholar rejoiced, knowing the illness could be cured. If it were true oblivion, even the workings of creation could do nothing—how could a Confucian’s shallow art suffice?\n\nConfucians, who exhume graves under the guise of poetry and ritual, are the greatest corrupters of the Dao. Their methods subtly mislead the people, making them depart from truth and embrace falsehood without awareness. Thus, the scholar insisted his method was secret and must be transmitted only in strict privacy. After seven days together, the chaos within Hua Zi perished, and his sight, hearing, eating, and breathing became like those of ordinary men. The long-standing illness vanished in a single morning.\n\nOnce Hua Zi awoke, he flew into a great rage, cast out his wife, punished his children, and brandished a halberd to drive away the scholar. The people of Song seized him and demanded an explanation. Hua Zi said: \"Before, when I was forgetful, I was vast and unaware of the existence of heaven and earth. Now, suddenly recalling the past, decades of life and death, gain and loss, sorrow and joy, likes and dislikes—all ten thousand threads surge forth. I fear that future matters of life and death, gain and loss, sorrow and joy, and likes and dislikes will disturb my heart like this. Can I ever again attain even a moment’s forgetfulness?\"\n\nZi Gong heard of this and found it strange. He reported it to Confucius, who said: \"This is not something within your grasp.\" Then he turned to Yan Hui and told him to record it.\n\nThe explanation states: The difficulty of encountering truth and the ease with which falsehood confuses people have persisted for a long time. When one’s joy lies in truth, the myriad things cannot alter one’s preferences, and even the love of wife and children may be forsaken. Nothing in the world can compare to its worth, and even the Confucian Dao is not worth adhering to. Thus, once Hua Zi awoke, he cast out his wife, punished his children, and drove away the scholar with a halberd. Knowing the joy of forgetfulness, he should have been able to forget worldly burdens without a second thought. Yet he still feared external things would disturb his heart and prevent even a moment’s forgetfulness—how much worse for those who never knew the joy of forgetfulness and daily rush toward the path of right and wrong? When Hua Zi’s family regarded his forgetfulness as a household affliction, and the scholar rejoiced at curing his illness, how utterly confused their hearts must have been!\n\nThe man called Hua Zi of Yang district in Song: \"Yang\" pertains to growth and nurturing, while \"Hua\" (flourishing) thrives under yang—both incline toward the path of turmoil. In middle age, he fell ill with forgetfulness, shedding his flourishing and returning to the root. But once awakened, he again rushed toward the path of entanglement. The reversal of the norm is the joyous sheen of *Dui*; the emergence of life is the hasty decisiveness of *Zhen*. Thus, Hua Zi flew into a great rage upon awakening.\n\nZi Gong belonged to the category of eloquence, considering himself superior to others in discernment, yet he was rebuked by Confucius. Yan Hui, however, could forget benevolence and righteousness, forget ritual and music, and repeatedly advanced until he attained \"sitting in forgetfulness.\" Therefore, Confucius turned to Yan Hui to record this.\n\nAmong the Feng clan of Qin there was a man whose son was clever in youth but developed a bewildering illness in adulthood. He heard singing and mistook it for weeping; saw white and thought it black; smelled fragrance and deemed it rotten; tasted sweetness and found it bitter; walked correctly and believed it wrong. Wherever his mind wandered—heaven and earth, the four directions, water and fire, cold and heat—nothing was not inverted.\n\nThe Yang family told his father: \"The gentlemen of Lu possess many arts and skills—perhaps they can cure him? Why not seek them out?\" His father traveled to Lu and, passing through Chen, encountered Lao Dan. He described his son’s symptoms. Lao Dan said: \"Are you any less deluded than your son? Today, the people of the world are all confused by right and wrong, blinded by profit and harm. Those with the same illness are many, yet none are awakened. Moreover, the delusion of one person is not enough to overturn a household; the delusion of a household is not enough to overturn a village; the delusion of a village is not enough to overturn a state; the delusion of a state is not enough to overturn the world. If the whole world were deluded, who would overturn it? If all the people of the world were like your son, then you would be the deluded one. Joy and sorrow, sound and color, scent and taste, right and wrong—who can correct them?\"\n\nThe explanation states: Singing and weeping, white and black, fragrance and stench, sweetness and bitterness—even heaven and earth, the four directions, water and fire, cold and heat—all these manifold names share a single wondrous root, originally without distinction. It is through deluded emotions that likes and dislikes arise, that things are distinguished, and that various false names are assigned. Seeking reality through names, clinging stubbornly without change—none are awakened.",

      "translated_text": "\"To examine but one aspect: to take white as white is to follow the multitude; to take white as black is to follow oneself. Following oneself invites doubt from the many; following the many brings confusion to oneself. Their words differ, mine differ—white and black bear distinct names. Though names and words diverge, the essence remains unmoved; it is only in names and words that distinctions arise. The many and the few contend, and the few cannot withstand the many. Leading delusion with delusion, all sink together and do not return—how can one hastily deem the shared affliction of the multitude as right and the solitary awakening of the one as wrong?\n\nMaster Yang believed his Dao could overturn the world, yet he still contended with the Confucians and Mohists over right and wrong, white and black. Thus, Feng was troubled by this and sent him to seek counsel from the many masters of Lu. Feng was one who met things and matched them, hence in youth he was clever, but in maturity he took delusion and confusion as his malady.\n\nMoreover, my own words here are not necessarily free from delusion—how much less can the gentlemen of Lu, those couriers of delusion, resolve the delusions of others? Better to take your provisions and return home.\n\nThe explanation states: The world originally has no fixed right; the great Dao does not enter into verbal explanations. Yet the sages, in bequeathing teachings to the world, could not avoid such discourse. They also feared that learners would take the words of the multitude as wrong and the words of the sages as right, clinging to them without release, guarding them without forgetting—as the saying goes, 'Gold, though precious, becomes a film in the eye.'

      "translated_text": "Then he sighed deeply. Pointing to a house, they said, \"This is your ancestors’ dwelling.\" He wept silently. Pointing to a mound, they said, \"This is your ancestors’ grave.\" The man could not restrain his sobs. His companions burst into laughter, saying, \"We deceived you before—this is but Jin.\" The man was overcome with shame.\n\nWhen at last he reached Yan and truly beheld the city and village shrine of his homeland, when he truly saw his ancestors’ dwelling and grave, his sorrow had already grown faint. The explanation follows: Those who transmit teachings may be true or false; those who receive the Dao may do so early or late. What enters first becomes the master; what enters later becomes the guest. Today’s scholars, having first encountered a teacher who transmits false methods, cling to them and guard them, believing nothing could surpass them. Years later, should they suddenly meet a true teacher who imparts the true principle, they cling to disbelief instead, and to the end of their days remain unenlightened—how lamentable!\n\nThus Liezi set forth this parable of the Yan man passing through Jin. This man, born in Yan and raised in Chu, returned in old age. Passing through Jin, his companions deceived him, saying, \"This is the city of Yan.\" His expression changed sorrowfully. Pointing to a shrine, they said, \"This is the village shrine of your homeland.\" He sighed deeply. Pointing to a house, they said, \"This is your ancestors’ dwelling.\" He wept silently. Pointing to a mound, they said, \"This is your ancestors’ grave.\" He could not restrain his sobs. His companions burst into laughter, saying, \"This is Jin—we deceived you before.\" The man was overcome with shame.\n\nWhen at last he reached Yan and truly saw his ancestors’ dwelling and grave, his sorrow had already subsided and could not arise again. For the heart is moved by what it first encounters; upon seeing it deeply a second time, it regards it as ordinary. Moreover, one’s homeland is meant to be a place of joy in life, yet the nearer he drew, the more his distress grew, until at last he could only weep—where was the joy in living?\n\nWhat he had taken for Yan was not Yan at all, but merely a city of Jin. They had deceived him with falsehood, and he had believed it as truth. From the deceivers’ perspective, this was truly cause for mockery. Thus we know that what people call inner and outer, near and far, joy and anger, sorrow and delight, are no different from the Yan man’s deception. In their attachments to near and far, sorrow and joy, they too are surely laughed at by the Creator, just as the Yan man was.\n\nIf one could awaken to the unreality of such things, one would surely reflect: in times when sorrow and grief arise, how could they persist? Yet near and far do not lie in things but in oneself; truth and falsehood do not lie in circumstances but in the heart. When the heart is true, even the false becomes true; when the heart is deluded, even the true becomes false.\n\nHad the people of Jin never revealed their deception, the Yan man’s emotions would never have changed. But once he knew he had been deceived, even when he truly saw his ancestors’ dwelling and grave, his sorrow grew faint. Why? The human heart is not inherently untrue, but once led astray by others, it cannot return to truth. Thus the Yan man’s true feelings, once scattered, could never be restored. Though later they came to him in sincerity, he examined them for falsehood, and even when he forced himself to grieve, he could not—how could he not be cautious?\n\nTracing the teachings of Laozi and Zhuangzi, we find their great aim was to anchor the people in nameless simplicity, preventing them from being swayed by falsehood—not to govern them after their nature had already been corrupted. Thus the *Daodejing* concludes with nameless simplicity, teaching that one should not desire stillness, and the world will naturally turn toward uprightness. The *King Mu* chapter ends with this as well.\n\nThe *King Mu* commentary: From the August Thearch down to the achievements of kings, though it is said the Dao descended repeatedly, the responses of emperors and kings to the world all arose from the Dao and were the work of sages, differing only in their adaptation to the times. In the age of the Thearch, one could not but perform the works of the Thearch; in the age of the King, one could not but perform the works of the King. Governance reaches its end in the works of the King, and even the enduring virtue of the worthy nearly attains it. Thus Yu, Tang, Wen, and Wu all performed the works of kings. Qi’s worthiness was sufficient to carry on Yu’s Dao, and King Cheng’s mediocrity was enough to preserve the legacy of Wen and Wu.\n\nBy the time of King Mu, the Dao was insufficient to be transmitted, and the marvel of transforming others did not fill his virtue but harmonized with music—from this point, the Zhou Dao declined. In speaking of the Thearch, we speak of its flourishing; in speaking of the King, we speak of its decline—this is the principle of beginning and end.\n\nMoreover, the virtue of the Five Thearchs and the achievements of the Three Kings, though their Dao was profound and constant, were at times illusory, like a dream. Thus this chapter vividly illustrates the principle of dreaming and waking, as if there were an ancient, wild land where people took their dreams as reality, or rustic folk who remained awake and never slept. Those who exhaust their thoughts by day dream nightly of being servants; those who labor their bodies by day dream nightly of being lords. As for the dispute over the deer, waking and dreaming become indistinguishable.\n\nThe traces of sages in responding to the world are like this. If one can discern the way of waking and dreaming, one knows that those who suffer delusion are not deluded by nature, nor are those who suffer forgetfulness forgetful by nature. Right and wrong, beauty and ugliness, are the same in the Dao. The transformations of the Dao, virtue, and achievement are all one in the end.",

At rest, they were at ease; in motion, they were content—this was the height of good governance.\n\nYet once the Dao was set aside for governance, the turning of the times inevitably led to the virtue of the emperors. The rule of the emperors—such as the Yellow Emperor, Yao, and Shun, who governed the world by merely draping their robes—was indeed flourishing, yet their virtue was already manifest. It must progress to the kingship of Tang and Wu, where all recognize the kingly achievements appearing in the time of Yu of Xia, though none realize its beginnings trace back to before the Three Sovereigns, and its remnants endure for a thousand generations thereafter.\n\nThus, the descent of the Dao is like water leaving its source: its flow is ceaseless, and as it drifts ever farther from its origin, it can never return.

      "translated_text": "\"This was my teaching of former days—pray let my present words be taken as correct. You merely know that rejoicing in Heaven and knowing fate bring no sorrow, yet do not know that rejoicing in Heaven and knowing fate entail a sorrow of great magnitude.\"\n\n*Explanation:* Yan Hui’s joy lies in the Dao, while Confucius’s sorrow concerns humanity. From the perspective of the multitude, only Yan Hui is uniquely joyful; from Yan Hui’s perspective, only Confucius is uniquely sorrowful. What Heaven bestows, one rejoices in and does not refuse—this is called rejoicing in Heaven. What fate ordains, one follows and does not resist—this is called knowing fate. To rejoice in Heaven yet not know fate, or to know fate yet not rejoice in Heaven, is insufficient to be free from sorrow. Though one who rejoices in Heaven and knows fate finds joy even in poverty, the joy of such a one is not in poverty or prosperity—this is why there is no sorrow. Yan Hui has attained this Dao, and thus, dwelling amid sorrows that others cannot bear, he remains unchanged in his joy.\n\nYet Confucius, having lived sixty years, underwent sixty transformations. What he once affirmed, he later deemed mistaken. To take rejoicing in Heaven and knowing fate as freedom from sorrow was his former affirmation. To regard rejoicing in Heaven and knowing fate as a sorrow of great magnitude is his present teaching. Compared to Confucius, Yan Hui grasped his conduct but not the reason for his conduct—hence he took up the zither and sang, yet could not share the sage’s sorrow.\n\nMoreover, both are the words of a sage—how could there truly be contradiction or discord? Adapting to the times and suiting change, I merely ask that the present teaching be taken as correct. As for true joy and true knowledge, how can the words of past and present be distinguished?\n\nNow I tell you the truth: cultivate the self, accept poverty or prosperity, know that going and coming are not of the self, and banish disturbance from the mind—this is what you call rejoicing in Heaven and knowing fate without sorrow. Formerly, I cultivated the *Odes* and *Documents*, rectified rites and music, intending to govern the world and bequeath it to future generations—not merely to cultivate myself or govern the state of Lu. Yet the rulers and ministers of Lu daily lost their proper order; benevolence and righteousness grew ever weaker, human nature ever more shallow. If this Dao cannot prevail in one state or one generation, how much less in the world and future ages?\n\nI first realized that the *Odes*, *Documents*, rites, and music could not save the world from disorder, yet I did not know the means to reform them—this is the sorrow of one who rejoices in Heaven and knows fate. Nevertheless, I have grasped it now. The joy and knowledge of which I speak are not what the ancients meant by joy and knowledge. Without joy and without knowledge—this is true joy and true knowledge. Thus there is nothing not joyful, nothing not known, nothing not sorrowful, nothing not done. What need is there to abandon the *Odes*, *Documents*, rites, and music? Why reform them?\n\n*Explanation:* The sage is the utmost of virtue and the perfection of the Dao. To call one a sage is to say that the mind is congealed and form released, with nothing cherished and nothing feared—what sorrow could there be? Even the benevolent can be free from sorrow, how much more Confucius, who embodied the sage’s consummation? If he were not free from sorrow, he could not be called a sage. To say the sage has sorrow is to misunderstand the sage.\n\nYet now, manifesting such great sorrow in countenance—this is because the sage is the linchpin of the ten thousand things, the one on whom all transformation depends, and who bears the weight of the world. If, by rejoicing in Heaven and knowing fate, I cultivate myself, accept poverty or prosperity, know that going and coming are not of the self, and still disturbances in the mind, then I am without sorrow—but how can I ensure that all the people are without sorrow? If the people are not entirely free from sorrow, how can the sage alone be without sorrow? His sorrow is not only for the present age but extends to future generations. The ages to come are endless, the people’s sorrows inexhaustible, and the sage’s sorrow likewise without end—is this not a sorrow of great magnitude?\n\nMoreover, I cultivated the *Odes* and *Documents*, rectified rites and music, seeking to bring order, yet the Dao did not prevail. Seeing that the *Odes*, *Documents*, rites, and music could not save the world from disorder, I thought to reform them but did not know the way—how could I be without sorrow? Why is this? The Six Classics are the traces left by the former kings—are they the essence of those traces? The footprints are what the shoes produce, but are the footprints the shoes? Though the traces cannot be clung to, the shoes cannot be discarded either. Thus, the *Odes*, *Documents*, rites, and music—if abandoned, there is no means to govern; if followed, they cannot bring governance. Now, to take rejoicing in Heaven and knowing fate as freedom from sorrow is to abandon the shoes along with the traces—how then can governance be achieved?\n\nTherefore, to call it rejoicing in Heaven is still to have something rejoiced in. To call it knowing fate is still to have something known. Having something rejoiced in necessarily entails sorrow; having something known necessarily entails omission. Only by attaining what is called true joy and true knowledge can there be no joy and no knowledge. Without joy and without knowledge, there is nothing not joyful, nothing not known, nothing not sorrowful, nothing not done—joy and sorrow both forgotten. Acting without acting, all is relinquished. The *Odes*, *Documents*, rites, and music need not be abandoned or reformed, yet the world can be governed and future ages bequeathed. This is what the *Book of Changes* means by \"stirring the ten thousand things yet not sharing the sage’s sorrow.\" This is why Confucius edited the *Odes*, established the *Documents*, appended the *Book of Changes*, and composed the *Spring and Autumn*—earnestly transmitting these teachings.\n\nYan Hui bowed northward and said, \"I too have grasped it.\" He went out and told Zigong. Zigong was lost in bewilderment, returned home, and brooded for seven days without sleep or food, until his bones stood out. Yan Hui went again to explain it to him, whereupon he returned to Confucius’s gate, strumming the zither and chanting the classics all day without cease.\n\n*Explanation:* Yan Hui once asked Confucius to let him go to Wei, but Confucius thought it perilous, saying, \"You would likely go and be punished.\" Was this perhaps because he had not yet grasped the meaning of rejoicing in Heaven and knowing fate as entailing a sorrow of great magnitude?",

      "translated_text": "As for Yan Hui’s saying that \"when employed, he acts; when set aside, he withdraws\"—this being the same as Confucius—it was because he had attained this understanding. As for Zigong, though his wisdom sufficed to recognize the sage, he had not yet heard of the sage’s Heavenly Dao, and thus fell into bewilderment and self-loss. Nevertheless, his deep reflection over time, enduring without sleep or food until his bones stood out, showed that he had forgotten his self and merged with principle, making it possible to instruct him in the sage’s Way. Thus, upon receiving Yan Hui’s explanation, he released his doubts and returned to the Master’s gate, where he spent his days strumming the zither and chanting the classics. In his music, he found joy; in his recitations, he understood that the *Odes* and *Documents* need not be discarded.\n\nA minister from Chen, on a diplomatic mission to Lu, privately visited the house of the Shusun clan. The Shusun lord said, \"There is a sage in our state.\" The minister asked, \"Is it not Kong Qiu?\" \"It is,\" he replied. \"How do you know he is a sage?\" The Shusun lord said, \"I once heard Yan Hui say, ‘Kong Qiu can set aside the mind and employ the body.’\"\n\nThe minister from Chen said, \"There is also a sage in our state—did you not know?\" \"Who is this sage?\" he asked. \"Among Lao Dan’s disciples was one named Kang Cangzi, who attained Lao Dan’s Dao and could see with his ears and hear with his eyes.\" When the Duke of Lu heard this, he was greatly astonished and sent his highest minister with lavish gifts to invite him. Kang Cangzi accepted the invitation and arrived. The Duke of Lu humbly questioned him. Kang Cangzi said, \"The transmission is false. I can see and hear without using my ears and eyes, but I cannot alter the functions of ears and eyes.\"\n\nThe Duke of Lu said, \"This is even more extraordinary—what is your Way? I earnestly wish to hear it.\"\n\n*Explanation:* Human perception and hearing do not depart from the body. Even the sage has no means to differ from others in this; only the sage’s perception and hearing rely on the body to manifest clarity, not being entirely bound by it. Precisely because he is not bound by the body, he can set aside the mind; precisely because he relies on the body, he still employs its form. \"Setting aside the mind\" corresponds to Kang Cangzi’s seeing and hearing without using ears and eyes; \"employing the form\" corresponds to his inability to alter the functions of ears and eyes. Since Kang Cangzi’s sageliness is no different from Confucius’s, we know that Confucius’s Dao is no different from the Old Master’s Dao.\n\nKang Cangzi said, \"My body unites with the mind, the mind unites with qi, qi unites with spirit, and spirit unites with nothingness.\"\n\n*Explanation:* In the Great Beginning, there was nothingness—nothingness without name—yet spirit moved within it. The Great Beginning presaged the inception of qi; qi harmonized and gave rise to life, and with life came the mind. The balance of creation is bestowed upon humanity in this way. The difference between the mad and the sage lies in what they unite with. The sage ever ascends and unites with nothingness; united with nothingness, there is nowhere he does not unite. The common person ever descends and unites with things; united with things, there is nowhere he is not obstructed. When the body unites with the mind, one forgets the form; when the mind unites with qi, one forgets thought; when qi unites with spirit, one becomes a single undifferentiated qi, sagely and unknowable. Yet though spirit is wondrous, it has not departed from being. Only when spirit unites with nothingness does it merge with the Great Void, neither ending in the vast nor neglecting the minute, with no thing escaping its mirror. Whether it be the faintest existence or the faintest sound—though distant in the eight wilds or near at the brows and lashes—whatever comes to me, I must know it. Yet this is not the awareness of the seven apertures and four limbs, nor the knowledge of the six viscera within the chest and abdomen; it is self-knowing alone.\n\nThe Duke of Lu was overjoyed. Another day, he told this to Zhongni, who smiled but did not answer.\n\n*Explanation:* The eight wilds are the farthest reaches, where mountains and rivers spread and the ten thousand things intermingle, beyond the scope of sight and hearing. The brows and lashes are the nearest, where the viscera reside within and the orifices without, yet knowledge and perception cannot perceive themselves. When spirit unites with nothingness, the body merges with emptiness, and the appearances of things dissolve into the apex—all becomes the Great Void. Though the tiniest insect may be as visible as the slopes of Mount Song, how much more so the faintest existence? Though the faintest sound may be as audible as thunder, how much more so the faintest tone? The Old Master said, \"The farther it extends, the less one knows.\" This principle accords with that. Nevertheless, the sage does not strive for excessive knowledge; whatever comes to me, I know it. Only by not pursuing external knowledge does one remain unaware and unknowing, yet one’s knowledge arises naturally, with nothing unknown. If one’s knowledge were obtained through perception, it would not depart from the body; if obtained through thought, it would not transcend reflection. How then could one know all without exception? Kang Cangzi’s words exhaust the matter—so perfectly aligned with the heart that no sound could contain it. Thus, when the Duke of Lu told this to Zhongni, Zhongni smiled but did not answer.\n\nThe Grand Steward of Shang visited Confucius and asked, \"Is Qiu a sage?\" Confucius said, \"How would Qiu dare claim sageliness? Yet Qiu is one who has broadly studied and widely retained knowledge.\" The Grand Steward asked, \"Were the Three Kings sages?\" Confucius said, \"The Three Kings were good at employing wisdom and courage—whether they were sages, Qiu does not know.\" He asked, \"Were the Five Emperors sages?\" Confucius said, \"The Five Emperors were good at employing benevolence and righteousness—whether they were sages, Qiu does not know.\" He asked, \"Were the Three Sovereigns sages?\" Confucius said, \"The Three Sovereigns were good at following the times—whether they were sages, Qiu does not know.\"\n\nThe Grand Steward of Shang was greatly astonished.\n\n*Explanation:* The Dao is one alone. From the Sovereigns it descended to the Emperors; Yao transmitted it to Shun in this way, and Shun to Yu. Tang, Wen, and Wu were all ancient sages. Yet the simplicity of Fuxi, the yielding of Yao and Shun, the contention of Tang and Wu, and Confucius’s uncrowned kingship—all were responses to the times out of necessity, and thus the sageliness within them was concealed.",

      "translated_text": "Thus, when Confucius was questioned by the Grand Steward of Shang, regarding himself he said, \"I dare not,\" and regarding others, \"I do not know.\" Nevertheless, those who skillfully follow the times manifest the Dao; those who skillfully employ benevolence and righteousness make virtue evident; those who skillfully apply wisdom and courage enrich their achievements; and those who broadly study and amass knowledge exhaust principle and fulfill their nature—all are the affairs of the sage, merely that he dare not claim to know.\n\nMoreover, the Sovereigns descended to the Emperors, and the Emperors descended to the Kings. The Grand Steward of Shang was but an assistant to the kings; how could he, still occupied with following and upholding their governance, suddenly be told that one does not know whether the Emperors or Sovereigns were sages? How could he not be astonished?\n\nHe asked, \"Then who is a sage?\" Confucius changed his countenance and paused, then said, \"In the West, there is a sage.\"\n\n*Explanation:* The so-called sage is the Dao of the Sovereigns, the virtue of the Emperors, the achievements of the Kings, and the culmination of Confucius. What Confucius told the Grand Steward of Shang were all the affairs of the sage. The reason he did not claim sageliness was that the sage, in his sageliness, partakes of the numinous and is unknowable. When the sage acts and presages transformation, he becomes visible to all things. Yet what makes him a sage remains concealed; one may know his governance but not his Dao.\n\nThe Grand Steward of Shang sought the sage outside the sage—his confusion was profound. Confucius changed his countenance, intending to rectify his demeanor and enlighten him. When the change in countenance and pause brought no understanding, it became clear he would never grasp the words. Thus, Confucius told him, \"In the West, there is a sage.\"\n\nThe so-called \"person of the West\" refers to the sage who does not depart from the numinous, the root origin of Heaven that has not yet presaged transformation. The West is the direction of returning to life and reverting to one’s nature. Moreover, the Way of Heaven moves from the West to the North; only upon reaching the North is the return to life complete. When *Liezi* speaks of the Dao of the sage, it often alludes to the West, aiming to dispel the decadence of the declining Zhou and the excesses of culture, urging the people to abandon superficiality and embrace substance. Thus, it speaks of the West as the origin of transformation and the destination of Lao Dan’s departure.\n\nAs for the distinction of the North, it will soon give rise to the arousal of *Zhen*. Such is the purport of these words.",

      "translated_text": "Without governance yet without disorder, without speech yet self-trusting, without transformation yet self-acting—so vast and boundless that the people cannot name it. I, Qiu, suspect this to be sageliness, yet do not know whether it is truly sageliness or truly not sageliness.\n\nTo explain: The world originally had no affairs; those people abided in constant spontaneity. If one cannot bear the harms of an age and thus governs it, one disrupts the repose of ten thousand generations without hope of remedy. Therefore, those who respond as emperors and kings do so through the Dao, observing the transformations of words and the destinies of things to avoid entanglement. Yet where there are words, there will be those who doubt them; where there is transformation, there will be those who resist it. If names exist amid order and chaos, one strays ever farther from sageliness. Only that which is so vast and boundless that the people cannot name it may be likened to sageliness.\n\nOld Master said: \"The Dao is ever nameless and without beginning,\" for the Dao ought not to be named. The sage is the utmost of the Dao; if it can be named, it is not the Dao. From Fuxi to Confucius, have their responses to the world not been nearly akin to selling fame and reputation across the realm? No wonder Confucius did not recognize his own sageliness.\n\nYet if one takes the inability to be named as sageliness, then to name it \"nameless\" is already to have named it—how can it remain unnameable? That which ultimately cannot be named is the true nature of the Dao. To name it \"unnameable\" and thereby allude to its namelessness is the sage’s unavoidable concession. Thus, though Confucius said, \"In the West there is a sage,\" he ultimately declared he did not know whether it was truly sageliness or truly not sageliness.\n\nNevertheless, this \"unnameable\" does not mean emptiness, non-action, or detachment from all designation as nothingness. Rather, it is to act without being burdened by action, as if nameable yet without the substance of a name. Thus, Confucius once praised Yao as \"so vast and boundless that the people could not name him,\" yet did not deny his towering achievements.\n\nConsider Confucius’ words to the Grand Steward of Shang: at first, he did not know him to be a sage; in the end, he still doubted whether he was a sage. None knew his traces at the beginning, nor his subtleties at the end—sageliness that cannot be known, therein it resides. The Grand Steward of Shang fell silent and pondered in his heart, \"Kong Qiu has deceived me!\"\n\nTo explain: Only where there is a fixed standard can deception occur. The Grand Steward of Shang, confronted with Confucius’ words, found his eloquence insufficient to refute their principle and his sincerity insufficient to trust his Dao, so he pondered in his heart that he had been deceived.\n\nZixia asked Confucius, \"What sort of person is Yan Hui?\"\nThe Master said, \"Hui’s benevolence surpasses my own.\"\n\"What sort of person is Zigong?\"\n\"The acuity of Ci surpasses my own.\"\n\"What sort of person is Zilu?\"\n\"The courage of You surpasses my own.\"\n\"What sort of person is Zizhang?\"\n\"The solemnity of Shi surpasses my own.\"\n\nZixia rose from his mat and asked, \"Then why do these four serve you?\"\nThe Master said, \"Sit.

Were I to exchange my own qualities for the sum of theirs, I would not consent. This is why they serve me without divided loyalty.\n\nTo explain: The virtues of these disciples are like yin and yang; the Dao of the sage is like the harmonizing qi. The harmonizing qi is subtler than yin and yang, yet yin and yang draw upon it. Though each of the four possesses qualities surpassing my own, I would not consent to exchange my own for the sum of theirs. Thus, their excellence is precisely what makes them partial, and their deficiency is precisely what makes them wondrous—this is why they serve me without divided loyalty.\n\nMaster Liezi, having taken Huqiu Zilin as his teacher and befriended Boshi Maoren, then dwelled in Nanguo. Those who followed him there came daily in such numbers that they could not be counted.\n\nTo explain: After Liezi had advanced in the Dao of these two masters and returned riding the wind, his own cultivation had reached its utmost perfection. Yet he could not bear to keep the Master’s Dao solely for his own benefit, so he took up residence in Nanguo. Nanguo was a bustling district within the city walls. Once he had emerged to engage with the world, he could not prevent people from flocking to him, and the sandals outside his door piled up. Nevertheless, Master Liezi remained subtle in his way.\n\nEach morning, he debated with others, and there was nothing he did not hear. Yet for twenty years, he shared a wall with Nanguozi and never paid him a formal visit. When they met on the road, their eyes seemed not to see each other. The disciples and servants in his household took it for granted that Liezi and Nanguozi were rivals.\n\nTo explain: Nanguozi embodied the subtlety of the Dao, dwelling amid the dust without being stained by it—this was why he and Liezi shared a wall. The Dao of these two masters was perfectly round and wondrously attuned, ever meeting without seeking, seeing without appearing. Why, then, would they need to pay formal visits? Not only did they not visit each other, but even when they met on the road, their eyes seemed not to see. For those who study the Dao, to have the Dao present at a glance is already the utmost. Yet to rely on such a glance is still not free from perception. Only when they met and their eyes seemed not to see was perception transcended. Without mutual engagement, without action, self and other both forgotten—Liezi’s Dao was perfected in this. Thus it is said: Master Liezi was also subtle. Subtle in that his words never departed from the Dao, his heart refined and wondrous.\n\nYet if each morning he debated with others and heard everything, was this love of debate? It was only because of those who followed him that he could not avoid it. His disciples and servants, seeing Liezi engaged in debate, took his lack of formal visits to Nanguozi as proof of rivalry.\n\nA man from Chu came and asked Liezi, “In what way is your master a match for Nanguozi?”\nLiezi said, “Nanguozi’s appearance is full, his heart empty. His ears do not hear, his eyes do not see, his mouth does not speak, his heart does not know, his form is without fear. What could he possibly do?”\n\nTo explain: “Appearance full” means his cultivation preserved his form without decline. “Heart empty” means he forgot his heart and things did not linger. “Ears do not hear” means he heard only himself. “Eyes do not see” means he saw only himself. “Mouth does not speak” means his words were not mere words. “Heart does not know” means true knowing is without knowing. “Form without fear” means he had no apprehensions or taboos. One like this has forgotten both teacher and disciple. What, then, could he do when he went forth?\n\n“Nevertheless,” Liezi said, “let us go together.” He gathered forty disciples and set out.\n\nTo explain: Liezi had already spoken of Nanguozi’s subtlety, but fearing his followers would remain deeply confused about the ultimate Dao, he went with them to witness it firsthand. The forty disciples who accompanied him were like the many who come together with others.\n\nWhen they saw Nanguozi, he seemed indeed like a lifeless effigy, impossible to engage. Looking back at Liezi, his form and spirit were not paired, and he could not be grouped with others.\n\nTo explain: Spirit gives rise to form, and form gives rise to spirit. The pairing of form and spirit is what gives rise to human life. When form and spirit are not paired, it is as if one has the form of a human but not the feelings—this is the kind of lifeless effigy Nanguozi resembled. A lifeless effigy is a clay figurine. One like this stands apart from things and people, solitary in his uniqueness. Thus he could not be engaged, nor could he be grouped with others.\n\nSuddenly, Nanguozi pointed to one of Liezi’s disciples in the rear rank and spoke with him, his manner joyful and forthright, as if he were the very embodiment of strength. Liezi’s disciples were astonished. When they returned home, all wore expressions of doubt.\n\nTo explain: In its stillness, the Qian hexagram is single-minded; in its movement, it is direct. *Kankan* describes its harmony. To be *kankan* yet forthright, as if embodying the strength of Qian, is to embody the Dao of Qian, presiding over the transformations of the myriad things and guiding them into great harmony. Suddenly pointing to a disciple in the rear rank and speaking with him was a response to encounter, not a deliberate act. His Dao was vast, so they were astonished. When trust is insufficient, there is distrust. Thus, upon returning, they all wore expressions of doubt—quite different from those who withdraw to reflect privately and thereby gain insight.\n\nLiezi said: “Those who grasp the meaning do not speak; those who advance in knowledge also do not speak. To use non-speech as speech is still speech; to use non-knowing as knowing is still knowing. Non-speech and not speaking, non-knowing and not knowing—these are also speech and knowing. They are also without anything not spoken, without anything not known, and also without anything spoken, without anything known. It is only thus. Why this groundless astonishment?”\n\nTo explain: Writing cannot fully express words, and words cannot fully express meaning—thus those who grasp the meaning do not speak. The knowing do not speak; those who speak do not know—thus those who advance in knowledge also do not speak.",

      "translated_text": "Yet to regard non-speech and non-knowing as correct is to sever oneself from things. To take not-speaking and not-knowing as right is still not to forget the self. To take speech and knowing as right is to gain but shallow understanding. Speaking of speech, one may speak all day yet never truly speak. Not speaking of non-speech, one may remain silent all day yet never truly cease speaking. Nothing is left unspoken, nothing is left unknown—yet nothing is spoken, nothing is known. Such was the meeting of these two masters. This alone is the constant of the Dao, nothing extraordinary—why then this groundless astonishment?\n\nAll that Liezi ever said comes to this, in agreement with the Old Master’s words: “How do I know the nature of all under heaven? By this.” Scholars who grasp this may awaken to the supreme Dao; beyond this, duality is not the truth. From this we see clearly the teachings of Liezi.\n\nWhen Liezi first studied under Old Shang, after three years his mind dared not entertain judgments of right and wrong, his mouth dared not speak of profit and harm—only then did Old Shang deign to glance at him. After five years, his mind again pondered right and wrong, his mouth again spoke of profit and harm—only then did Old Shang begin to relax his brow and smile. After seven years, whatever his mind thought held no right or wrong, whatever his mouth spoke held no profit or harm—only then did his master draw him near to share the same mat. After nine years, whether his mind wandered or his mouth uttered, he no longer knew his own right or wrong, profit or harm, nor that of others. Inner and outer had merged. Then his eyes became like ears, his ears like nose, his nose like mouth—all senses were undifferentiated. His mind congealed, his form dissolved, flesh and bone fused as one. He no longer sensed the body’s support, the feet’s tread, the mind’s thoughts, or the words’ concealment. Thus alone is principle nowhere hidden.\n\nTo explain: The madman and the sage dwell in different realms, yet upon close examination, their difference is but a hair’s breadth. The mind seeks to congeal but scatters; the form seeks release but remains bound. The mind races without return, the form is divided without communication. The mind is enslaved by the form, the form is driven by the mind. Even within a single body, the eye knows not the ear, the ear knows not the nose, the nose knows not the mouth—liver and gallbladder may as well be Chu and Yue. How much more so for the principles of the myriad things? He no longer senses the body’s support or the feet’s tread because his form has dissolved. He no longer knows the mind’s thoughts or the words’ concealment because his mind has congealed. Thus the ears, eyes, and nose mutually illuminate one another; flesh and bone fuse completely, merging with the spirit’s utmost emptiness. Whatever approaches me, my mind knows it—principle is nowhere hidden for this reason.\n\nLiezi once spoke of riding the wind in this way, and again of principle being nowhere hidden. Mastery of the wind lies within me; illumination of principle lies in things. Though their functions differ, if one attains this, there is nowhere one cannot go. To speak of the Dao and reach the point where seeing and hearing do not rely on eyes and ears, where flesh and bone fuse completely—this may be called wondrous, yet it seems beyond what learning can achieve. Yet the reason it is so lies in first daring not to think of right and wrong, not to speak of profit and harm, advancing step by step until the great wonder of nine years is attained. How then can scholars regard the supreme Dao as unattainable as climbing the sky and not strive for it?\n\nInitially, Liezi loved to wander.\nTo explain: The Dao of wandering is neither within nor without, nor does it dwell between the two. It moves above the myriad things, carefree between heaven and earth—this is the fullness and perfection of the Dao. Thus Liezi loved to wander, and Master Hu regarded wandering as the ultimate.\n\nMaster Huqiu asked: “Liezi loves to wander—what does he love about it?”\nLiezi replied: “The joy of wandering lies in playing with the unchanging. Others wander to observe what they see; I wander to observe what transforms. Wandering, wandering—none can distinguish this wandering.”\n\nMaster Huqiu said: “Liezi’s wandering is fundamentally the same as others’, yet you say it is fundamentally different? Whatever one sees is always seen in its transformations. Playing with the unchanging nature of things, one does not realize one’s own unchanging nature. Focusing on external wandering, one does not focus on internal observation. Those who wander externally seek completeness in things; those who observe internally find sufficiency in themselves. Finding sufficiency in oneself is the perfection of wandering; seeking completeness in things is the failure of wandering.”\n\nThereupon Liezi never left his home for the rest of his life, considering himself ignorant of wandering.\nTo explain: Observing what one sees, one perceives the phenomena of things—light and dark, passage and obstruction, mountains and rivers, people—seeing their forms as not uniform. Observing what transforms, one looks at those same phenomena, seeing the great and the small, the existent and the nonexistent, knowing their ceaseless change. Yet emptiness does not complete seeing, and seeing does not depart from things. All that is seen is change, and change does not depart from seeing. Observing seeing and observing change are equally confined by things—what difference is there? Moreover, seeing and what is seen are equally illusory, both revolving with things. Seeking completeness through the endless transformations of things only distances one further from the Dao. Thus external wandering that seeks completeness in things is not as good as internal observation that finds sufficiency in oneself.\n\nThe so-called internal observation is not to seek seeing apart from things. Within this single body of mine, I allow things to shift and transform on their own. Things turn as things, and I do not chase after them. Within the body that pursues change, the nature of perfect clarity remains unaltered. Within this single nature, all transformations are fully encompassed. Without needing to look around, is this not the perfection of wandering? The deluded do not know to find sufficiency in themselves and regard observing the transformations of things as superior to merely observing what is seen.",

      "translated_text": "The Explanation states: The Dao is that which nothing fails to penetrate. Having already attained the Dao of sagely wisdom, one may employ its truth to govern the self, and its surplus to order the state, while its unadorned essence may govern all under Heaven—nothing lies beyond its reach. Yet in Long Shu’s Dao, honor and disgrace, sorrow and joy cannot burden his heart; life and death, poverty and wealth cannot alter his thoughts. Within, he forgets the self; without, he forgets things. Neither punishments nor rewards sway him, neither profit nor harm change him, neither grief nor joy move him. His Dao has reached its utmost, its perfection—nothing can be added to it. Now, that his Dao cannot serve a lord, befriend kin, govern a wife and children, or command servants—this is to mistake the sage’s unwavering adherence to the root for the error of separating from transformation and dividing it into two.\n\nTo inwardly observe the root and outwardly perceive transformation—this alternation of emergence and withdrawal is neither different nor the same. If one were to take the great root and great origin of the Dao within oneself and extend it to govern all under Heaven and the state, flowing with things and harmonizing with their waves, then though one might encounter success or failure, creation or destruction, nothing would fail to engage one, yet one would never lose the Dao of supreme tranquility, and the myriad things would all attain their proper order. Yet Long Shu seeks to preserve the truth of his self-governance without engagement, hoping thereby to bring order to the myriad things—how can this be possible? This is why sagely wisdom is called an affliction.\n\nWen Zhi then instructed Long Shu to stand with his back to the light, while Wen Zhi himself faced the light from behind to observe him. The Explanation states: Commanding him to stand with his back to the light was to make him turn inward. Observing him from behind while facing the light was to examine whether he could remain without a mind responsive to things. After a moment, he said: Ah! I see your heart now—its square inch of space is empty. You are nearly a sage. Your heart has six apertures flowing freely, yet one remains unopened. Is it perhaps for this reason that you take sagely wisdom as an affliction? This is not something my shallow art can cure.\n\nThe Explanation states: In human life, the six senses join with the self to make seven, all of which the heart itself produces. Long Shu’s Dao levels all things equally—one might say his six apertures flow freely, yet he clings to the truth of his self-governance and cannot extend it to respond to things. Is this not the one aperture that remains unopened? It has been said that the heart and the body are the inner and outer of a single form, ever at odds like spear and shield. When all seven apertures are drilled open, Hun Dun dies; when all seven flow freely, sagely wisdom is complete. Those who embody the Dao regard having a body as the greatest affliction—does this not refer to this?\n\nWhat is called Wen Zhi clings to his patterns to respond to things; the sage is one who perceives the signs of transformation. Thus, Long Shu necessarily sought a method from Wen Zhi.\n\nThat which arises without cause and yet is ever-generating is the Dao. That which arises from life and thus lives, though it may end, does not perish—this is constancy. That which arises from life and yet perishes is misfortune. That which arises with cause and is ever-dying is also the Dao. That which arises from death and thus dies, though it may not yet end, perishes of itself—this too is constancy. That which arises from death and yet lives is good fortune.\n\nThus, that which employs nothing and yet governs life is called the Dao; that which employs the Dao and attains its end is called constancy. That which employs something and thus dies is also called the Dao; that which employs the Dao and attains death is also called constancy.\n\nThe Explanation states: Once born, one should let go and entrust it, not clinging to life—this is to arise without cause and thus live constantly. When death approaches, one should exhaust its course and release it to its end—this is to arise with cause and thus die constantly. To speak of constant life and constant death is to say that though there is death and life, one has in truth never died or lived, and so enters into neither death nor life. This is why it is called the Dao.\n\nTo arise from life and thus live is to comprehend the essence of life, and so though one dies, one does not perish. To arise from death and thus die is to cling to life and lose principle, and so though one lives, one is as if dead. This is the constancy of principle.\n\nTo arise from life and yet perish—Yan’s early death is an example. To arise from death and yet live—Robber Zhi’s longevity is an example. These are matters of good or ill fortune.\n\nSome, though dead, are called spirits because they have attained the Dao; some, though dead, are called ghosts because they follow constancy; some, though dead, are called things—these arise from death and thus live, yet though they live, they are as if dead.\n\nWhen Ji Liang died, Yang Zhu gazed at his gate and sang. When Sui Wu died, Yang Zhu caressed his corpse and wept. When a servant is born, a servant dies—some sing, some weep. The Explanation states: Ji Liang did not dwell as the foremost of things; his Dao was sufficient above to uphold and below to shelter, transcending the waves to ferry the people to a place of no difficulty. Thus, in his death, he had advanced in the Dao of life and death. Therefore, Yang Zhu gazed at his gate and sang.\n\nAs for what is called Sui Wu—Sui as a tree has five calyxes and five bracts, yet its fruit does not sever its source. It is like one who can receive the center and establish destiny. Sui Wu, however, followed the transformations of things, truly unable to receive the center and establish destiny, and so sank into oblivion with things. Thus, in his death, Yang Zhu caressed his corpse and wept.\n\nServants know only to delight in life and hate death, yet do not understand the causes of life and death. Thus, they sing where they should weep and weep where they should sing—all is as it should be. Their singing and weeping alike are met with joy by those who possess the Dao, yet all are equally pitiable.\n\nAlas! In human life, the myriad things are distinguished and ordered, yet even in the slightest smile or frown, whether it accords with measure or not, all follow and become right or wrong. Yet when it comes to the great transformation of life and death, they sing and weep without awareness or awakening—can this not be a cause for great sorrow?\n\nOne whose eyes are about to go blind first sees the autumn down; one whose ears are about to go deaf first hears the gnat in flight; one whose mouth is about to lose its taste first distinguishes the waters of the Zi and the Meng; one whose nose is about to be blocked first detects the scent of burning and decay; one whose body is about to stiffen first hastens to flee and rest; one whose heart is about to be deluded first discerns right and wrong. Thus, when things have not yet arrived, one does not turn back.",

Thus, I cannot serve a lord, befriend kin, govern a wife and children, or command servants. What is this malady? And by what method can it be cured?\"",

      "translated_text": "A commentary states: Yin and Yang illuminate, cover, and govern one another; the four seasons succeed, give birth to, and destroy one another, following the inherent principles of their sequence and the mutual employment of their cyclical movements. When exhaustion is reached, there is reversion; when an end is reached, there is a beginning—this is the natural principle. Thus, when brightness reaches its extreme, there is blindness; when hearing reaches its extreme, there is deafness; when taste reaches its extreme, there is insipidity; when smell reaches its extreme, there is blockage; when vigor reaches its extreme, there is stiffness; when discernment reaches its extreme, there is delusion. Therefore, withdrawing one’s sight and returning to inner listening, cutting off flavors and removing fragrances, dismissing vigor and abandoning discernment—then the spirit will not decline, and though one may live for thousands or tens of thousands of years, one can deeply root and firmly establish oneself.\n\nIn the gardens and marshes of Zheng, many worthies abound; in the eastern quarter, many men of talent. During the labor at the gardens and marshes, there was a man named Bo Fengzi who, passing through the eastern quarter, encountered Deng Xi. Deng Xi turned to his disciples and laughed, saying: \"Let us perform a dance for him—what do you think of that one approaching?\" His disciples replied: \"We wish to know.\" Deng Xi said to Bo Fengzi: \"Do you understand the meaning of nurturing? To receive nurture from others yet be unable to nurture oneself is the way of dogs and swine. To nurture things so that they serve one’s use is the power of man. To make your disciples eat their fill, clothe themselves, and rest is the achievement of governance. Yet gathering the young and old like grass, treating them as livestock for the kitchen and pantry—how is this different from the way of dogs and swine?\" Bo Fengzi did not respond.\n\nOne of Bo Fengzi’s disciples then stepped forward out of turn and said: \"Has the master not heard of the many ingenious men in Qi and Lu? There are those skilled in earth and wood, those skilled in metal and leather, those skilled in music, those skilled in writing and calculation, those skilled in military affairs, and those skilled in ancestral rites—all talents are assembled. Yet none can determine rank, none can command others. Those who assign rank lack knowledge; those who command lack ability. Yet knowledge and ability are both employed by them. The one who governs is but one whom we employ—why should you boast?\" Deng Xi had no reply, so he glanced at his disciples and withdrew.\n\nA commentary states: The worthy conserves the spirit; the man of talent covets fame and position. Thus, the distance between worthiness and talent is vast indeed. Bo Fengzi’s worthiness and Deng Xi’s talent met upon the road: Deng Xi, coveting fame and position, danced before Bo Fengzi, while Bo Fengzi, conserving his spirit, resisted Deng Xi. His followers, unable to forget words, stepped out of turn to respond: \"Has the master not heard of the many ingenious men in Qi and Lu? Skilled in earth and wood, metal and leather, music, writing and calculation, military affairs, and ancestral rites—all are minor arts and those who serve. Those who assign rank lack knowledge; those who command lack ability. Those who lack knowledge and ability are emperors and kings. Those who possess knowledge and ability are ministers. Emperors and kings follow the Way of non-action; ministers hold the office of action. To serve the Way of non-action with the office of action—one who can square things cannot make them round, one who can make things white cannot make them black, one who can raise things high cannot bring them low, one who can make things dark cannot make them yellow. But to govern the office of action with the Way of non-action—then square and round, white and black, high and low, dark and yellow, none will be beyond mastery.\n\nThings each take shape according to their essence, yet this has no form. Things each acquire names according to their sound, yet this has no name. Thus, Deng Xi called the achievement of nurturing others so that things serve one’s use the work of governance, not knowing that the one who governs is but employed by others and cannot employ others. How can talent be relied upon? How can talent be a cause for pride?\"",

      "translated_text": "Thus, when he heard the words of Bo Fengzi’s followers, though their arguments were sharp, he had no opening to interject—he merely eyed his disciples and withdrew.\n\nGongyibo was renowned among the feudal lords for his strength. Tangxigong spoke of him to King Xuan of Zhou, who prepared gifts and rites to summon him. When Gongyibo arrived and the king observed his appearance, he seemed but a feeble man. Perplexed, King Xuan asked, “What is the measure of your strength?” Gongyibo replied, “My strength can snap the leg of a spring katydid and crush the wing of an autumn cicada.” The king’s expression darkened as he said, “My own strength can rend the hide of rhinoceros and elephant, drag the tails of nine oxen, yet I still lament its weakness. You snap the leg of a spring katydid and crush the wing of an autumn cicada, yet your strength is famed throughout the world—how can this be?”\n\nGongyibo sighed deeply, withdrew from his mat, and said, “Excellent is Your Majesty’s question. I dare speak the truth. My master is one named Shangqiuzi, whose strength is unmatched in the world, yet even his kin do not know it, for he has never employed his strength.” The commentary states: Gongyibo was versed in the rites of public office, exemplifying the saying that “the good knight is not martial”—this is what it means to employ the strength of others. *Tang* signifies the high and level foundation, the vantage from which one oversees construction, the ground to which all look up in reverence. Tangxigong’s virtue was like a hall, able to embrace the feminine and become the world’s stream—this is how he recognized that Gongyibo did not rely on his own strength. King Xuan of Zhou was a sovereign of the middle revival, who would task men with affairs and test them by their achievements; thus, he sought those who were martial and mighty. Shangqiuzi embodied the constant virtue of the mean, holding fast to spirit in his nature—this is why, though his strength was such that even his kin did not know it, he became Gongyibo’s master.\n\nMoreover, to snap the leg of a spring katydid and crush the wing of an autumn cicada is strength not worth relying upon; thus, he did not use his own strength but sought to employ the strength of others—this is why his strength was immeasurable. To rend the hide of rhinoceros and elephant and drag the tails of nine oxen is strength sufficient to meet any foe; yet if one relies on such strength, it does not increase, and those who surpass one will arrive. Is this not feebleness in the strong and courage in the weak?\n\n“I pledged my life in service, and he instructed me, saying: ‘One who wishes to see what others cannot see must observe what others do not; one who wishes to obtain what others cannot obtain must practice what others will not. Thus, those who train their sight first perceive a cartload of firewood; those who train their hearing first hear the tolling of a bell. For one whose inner self is at ease, nothing is difficult without.’\n\n“Since nothing is difficult without, his name did not spread beyond his own household. Now my name is known among the feudal lords—this is my violation of my master’s teaching, my display of my own ability. Yet my name is not built upon relying on my strength but upon my ability to employ the strength of others. Is this not better than relying on one’s own strength?”\n\nThe commentary states: To pledge one’s life in service is to cast aside limbs and dull the senses—this may be called possessing the substance. Thus, he instructed him. What is meant by “seeing what others cannot see” and “obtaining what others cannot obtain” is not that one perceives the obscure and hidden alone, but that one achieves what is difficult and impossible for others to do. What one sees does not depart from what all see, yet none perceive it. What one does does not exceed what all can do, yet none do it. Thus, nothing is more difficult to see than an autumn hair, yet nothing is easier than a cartload of firewood; nothing is more difficult to hear than a gnat in flight, yet nothing is easier than the tolling of a bell. If one exhausts the power of the eyes on an autumn hair, one’s sight will not extend beyond it; if one strains the power of the ears on a gnat in flight, one’s hearing will not surpass it. But if one borrows the clarity of the multitude, the eyes need not strain, and one’s sight will have clarity to spare; if one borrows the hearing of others, the ears need not exhaust themselves, and one’s hearing will have acuity to spare.\n\nThe common people see things but not the Way, so they constantly assail what is difficult. The worthy see the Way but not things, so they always do what is easy. When what is easy lies within, nothing is difficult without—when nothing is difficult, nothing is not easy. Who, then, can bestow a name upon one? Thus, one’s name does not extend beyond the Way.\n\nTherefore, one who can employ the strength of others, though his strength could turn heaven and earth, the world does not witness his might; though his authority subdues the realm, none call him martial. The ancients had a saying: “One skilled in strength lifts an autumn hair; one skilled in hearing hears thunder”—this is what it means.\n\nMoreover, to snap the leg of a spring katydid and crush the wing of an autumn cicada, though it may be called making the weak strong, still leaves traces of what has been snapped and crushed—its deeds can be seen, its name can be spoken. Thus, Gongyibo still took this as a display of his ability, violating his master’s teaching.\n\nZhongshan Gongzi Mou was a worthy prince of the state of Wei. He delighted in associating with the worthy but neglected state affairs, taking pleasure in the company of Gongsun Long of Zhao. The followers of Le Zhengzi Yu laughed at him. Gongzi Mou said, “Why do you laugh at my delight in Gongsun Long?” Ziyu replied, “Gongsun Long’s character is such that he acts without a teacher, studies without companions, is glib but misses the mark, rambles without a school, loves the strange and speaks recklessly. He seeks to confuse men’s minds and silence their mouths, practicing sophistry with the likes of Han Tan.”\n\nGongzi Mou’s expression changed as he said, “Why do you describe Gongsun Long’s faults so? Pray tell me the truth.” Ziyu said, “I laugh at how he deceived Kong Chuan, saying that a skilled archer can make the rear arrowhead strike the front nock, each shot following the last, arrow after arrow, so that the front arrow reaches the target without a break, and the nock of the rear arrow still holds the bowstring—appearing as one.

Why do you doubt it?”\n\nYue Zheng Ziyu said, “You are Gongsun Long’s disciple—how could you not gloss over his flaws? Let me speak of his greater absurdities. Long deceived the King of Wei, saying: ‘There is intention without mind, pointing without arrival, things not fully exhausted, shadows that do not move. A single hair can draw a thousand *jun*; a white horse is not a horse; an orphaned calf has never had a mother.’ His violations of categories and inversions of logic are beyond counting.”\n\nGongzi Mou said, “You take ultimate truths for absurdities—your error is the greater. Without intention, minds are the same; without pointing, all arrive; things fully known remain ever-present. Shadows that do not move are explained by transformation. A hair drawing a thousand *jun* is a matter of equal force. ‘A white horse is not a horse’ speaks to the separation of form and name. ‘An orphaned calf has never had a mother’—it is not an orphaned calf.”\n\nYue Zheng Ziyu said, “You take all of Gongsun Long’s clamor for reasoned argument.

Ultimate truths transcend words; though one may speak all day, one has not truly spoken. Thus, though one may expound endlessly upon the ten thousand things, discoursing without cease, multiplying without end, this does not impair their being the ultimate in speech.

      "translated_text": "A master archer can make the rear arrowhead strike the notch of the one before it, for he knows how to align the later with the earlier. When an arrow flies straight toward the pupil of the eye without the eyelid so much as fluttering, he has gauged the proper distance, assessed the strength of bow and arrow, and exhausted their potential without allowing the slightest excess or deficiency. All this can be deduced through reasoned principle.\n\nYet when words reside in the Dao, they leave form and abandon intellect, merging with the Great Thoroughfare. The intent is forgotten, the point negated. To exhaust the ten thousand things is ever to possess them, yet never to possess a single one—akin to the rod one foot in length, halved each day, never exhausted through ten thousand ages. The unmoving shadow: the former shadow is not the latter—akin to the arrow’s flight, so swift that there is a moment neither of motion nor of stillness. Equalize the potential of things, and a thousand jun are not heavy, a single hair not light. Depart from form and name, and whiteness cannot designate a horse, nor can \"horse\" name whiteness. A motherless calf has never had a mother. Calf and mother differ in bodily form and destiny, their principles not interchangeable. The subtlety of such words reaches this extreme—how could one who does not grasp the essence of language ever fathom their meaning?\n\nThus, before one has fully investigated principle, one laughs at them as deceit; yet when words reside in the Dao, one deems them perverse and contrary to reason. Though Gongzi Mou elucidated their meaning, Ziyu never awakened. Instead, he grew indignant, heaping scorn and reproach upon them. Gongzi Mou, knowing he could not speak of the ultimate Dao with him, fell silent and took his leave.\n\nYet Gongzi Mou had already come close to Ziyu’s level, still hoping that one day he might master himself and awaken. The ultimate words do not offend, yet he firmly rejected and utterly severed them. Hence he said, “Let me return another day to discuss this with you further.”\n\nGongsun Long’s disputations Gongzi Mou took for ultimate words; Liezi praised them, while Zhuangzi declared them capable of besting others in speech but not of winning their hearts. Liezi’s praise lauded their ultimacy. Zhuangzi, borrowing his arguments to dispel the traces of clinging to texts, at the end of his book both adopted his disputations and deplored those who, like him, made a spectacle of argument, lamenting their dissipation without attainment, their pursuit of the ten thousand things without return.\n\nTheir words differ, each appropriate in its own way.

      "translated_text": "Emperor Yao then donned humble attire and wandered the broad thoroughfares, where he heard children singing a folk song:\n\n*\"You set our teeming people aright,\nNone but you establish the norm.\nUnknowing, unperceiving,\nWe follow the Heavenly model’s form.\"*\n\nDelighted, Yao asked, \"Who taught you these words?\"\nThe children replied, \"We heard them from a minister.\"\nHe questioned the minister, who said, \"It is an ancient poem.\"\n\nYao returned to his palace, summoned Shun, and thereupon abdicated the realm to him. Shun did not decline but accepted.\n\n**Exegesis:**\nIn the age of the sage, there is no governance yet no disorder. Yao ruled the world for fifty years yet did not know whether it was well governed or not—this is precisely what is called *ultimate governance*. At that time, those at his side or in the outer court knew only to fulfill their duties faithfully; those in the wilds knew only their daily sustenance. Thus, from his attendants to the common folk, when questioned, none could say whether the realm was well governed or not. Yet Emperor Yao’s intent was to align Heaven with humanity, neither scorning the destitute nor abandoning the impoverished. He wished to know the truth, so he disguised himself and wandered the broad thoroughfares. In humble attire, he carried no outward authority to sway hearts; the thoroughfares were the crossroads of the nine provinces, where the sentiments of the four directions converged. The children’s song arose from natural joy, untainted by artifice. Its words—*\"You set our teeming people aright, / None but you establish the norm. / Unknowing, unperceiving, / We follow the Heavenly model’s form\"*—spoke of guiding the multitudes to a realm of ultimate principle, a Dao rooted in Heavenly virtue, far surpassing mere cleverness. The children had heard these words from a minister, who called it an ancient poem. That an ancient poem was now sung by children showed that present governance accorded with antiquity. Yao’s rule sought only to emulate the ancients—how could he not rejoice with his people upon hearing these words? This was the crowning achievement of Yao’s governance. The *Book of Documents* speaks of the people transforming into harmony—was this not that time?\n\nGuan Yinxi said:\n*\"Abiding nowhere within,\nYet all things take form through it.\nIn motion, it is like water;\nAt rest, like a mirror;\nIn response, like an echo.\"*\n\n**Exegesis:**\n*\"Abiding nowhere within\"* means leaving no speck of dust in the heart’s chamber. When utmost emptiness resides in me, the principles of the ten thousand things are nowhere concealed—hence *\"all things take form through it.\"* *\"In motion, it is like water\"* means it flows with change without constancy, yet its course is always fitting. *\"At rest, like a mirror\"* means it reflects things as they appear without grasping them. *\"In response, like an echo\"* means it answers every sound without anticipation or resistance. Thus, the Dao resembles things in this way. Things may stray from the Dao, but the Dao does not stray from things.\n\n**Exegesis:**\nThe Dao in things neither exceeds the great nor falls short of the small. Its vastness encompasses all boundaries; its subtlety penetrates the foulest depths. It apportions to things with perfect balance, neither lacking nor excess, stopping precisely where it should. Being like things in this way is why it is likened to a mirror and water. Thus, the Dao in the world is like the sun and moon illuminating all, their light reaching the four directions without obstruction—yet the blind do not see. Is the fault in the sun? Things stray from the Dao; the Dao does not stray from things. The proof lies here.\n\nThose who excel in the Dao neither employ the ears nor the eyes, neither strength nor the heart. To seek the Dao through seeing, hearing, form, or intellect is misguided. It may seem before you, then suddenly behind; in use, it fills the six directions; when set aside, its whereabouts are unknown. Neither those with intent can grasp it from afar, nor those without intent draw near. Only those who silently attain it and nurture it through their nature truly possess it.\n\n**Exegesis:**\nDevoid of sound or form, those who embody the Dao do not rely on ears or eyes. Without substance or function, they do not employ the heart or strength. Like following a trail, it may seem ahead, then suddenly behind. In use, one sees the Dao, not things—hence it fills the six directions. When set aside, one sees things, not the Dao—hence its whereabouts are unknown. How, then, does one excel in the Dao? Neither those with intent can grasp it from afar, for the Dao does not reside in non-action; nor can those without intent draw near, for the Dao is not exhausted by action. Only those who silently attain it and nurture it through their nature truly possess it. Silent attainment requires no words; nurturing through nature demands no action. Such possession is not the possession of others but the self’s own attainment. Only those who attain this neither drown in emptiness nor cling to existence. Within me, there is non-action yet nothing left undone; in things, there is non-use yet nothing unused.\n\nThose who know forget emotion; those who are capable do not act—this is true knowledge and true capability. If one acts without knowing, how can there be emotion? If one acts without capability, how can there be action?\n\n**Exegesis:**\nHumans are esteemed above the ten thousand things for their knowledge and ability. Yet they are enslaved by creation because they are ruled by knowledge and ability. What is prized in knowledge and ability is that the Dao cannot be drawn near by those without intent. What is detested in knowledge and ability is that the Dao cannot be grasped from afar by those with intent. Knowing yet forgetting emotion removes the chisel of cunning; one’s knowledge becomes natural, knowing all without exception—this is true knowledge. Capable yet not acting avoids the burden of action; one’s ability pervades all things without limit—this is true capability. Only with sincerity and trust can one embody the Dao. Acting without knowing is not forgetting emotion but being incapable of emotion—how can this be the Dao? Only those who can harmonize yin and yang embody the Dao.",

      "translated_text": "Unable to act—this is not \"non-action\" but true incapacity; how can this be the Dao? This is why the clumping of earth and the piling of dust are not the principle.\n\nConsider Shang Qiu Kai’s treading upon water and fire—this is knowing yet forgetting emotion. Consider Confucius’s abstention from playing metal and stone instruments—this is ability yet not acting. Clumped earth and piled dust, though non-active, are not the principle.\n\nExplanation: Clumped earth does not stir as the wild horses’ whirling gusts; piled dust does not rise as the flying motes—this may be called non-action. Yet though non-active, the generative principle is extinguished. What value, then, lies in non-action?\n\nThe Sage’s non-action is like the receptive Earth’s profound bearing: it fills the four voids, is without intent toward things, has never acted, yet the myriad things transform and grow, everlasting and unceasing—this is true non-action. From the Sovereign to the Emperors, from transmission to Confucius who perfected it, their Dao all originates here. Thus the chapter *\"Zhongni\"* concludes with this.\n\n**Zhongni’s Explanation**\nThe Dao of Confucius is like the great light rising in the east—none, whether foolish or wise, fail to know its brightness. Yet only by examining the words of sages and worthies can one plumb its subtleties.\n\nZi Gong said: \"In my view, the Master surpasses Yao and Shun by far.\"\nMencius said: \"Confucius is the one who perfected the great synthesis.\" And further: \"Since the birth of mankind, none has been greater than Confucius.\"\nYangzi said: \"Is not the Dao of Heaven embodied in Zhongni?\"\n\nZi Gong possessed wisdom sufficient to recognize the Sage. Mencius was a disciple of Confucius. Yangzi compared himself to Mencius. Their praise of the Sage is what the world and all generations take as their model.\n\nExamining the classics to seek the Master’s Dao: when office is possible, serve; when cessation is possible, cease; when duration is possible, endure; when haste is possible, hasten—without leaning toward any one side. When the times are pure, be pure; when the times call for service, serve; when the times are harmonious, be harmonious—without clinging to any one corner. Able to be benevolent and to extend it, able to be eloquent and to be reticent, able to be courageous and to be timid, able to be solemn and to be affable—unconfined by any single path.\n\nConfucius said: \"I differ from others in this: nothing is absolutely permissible or impermissible.\" Yet later scholars lean toward one side, cling to one corner, are confined to one path, and fail to perceive the Sage’s completeness—this is why the chapter *\"Zhongni\"* was composed.\n\nYanzi grasped only the joy of knowing Heaven’s decree and the absence of sorrow, yet did not know the great sorrow inherent in knowing Heaven’s decree. Yanzi, though next to a Sage, still required instruction to understand—how much more so Zi Gong and his peers, who exhausted their thoughts to the point of emaciation!\n\nGuan Yin said: \"Those who are good at the Dao do not rely on ears, do not rely on eyes, do not rely on strength, do not rely on the mind. Only by silently recognizing one’s nature and allowing it to mature can one attain it.\"\nMencius said: \"When office is possible, serve; when cessation is possible, cease; when duration is possible, endure; when haste is possible, hasten—this is what is meant by Confucius perfecting the great synthesis.\" These all understood Confucius.\n\nIn studying the meaning of this chapter, one sees the profoundest depths of Confucius.\n\nGeng Sangzi perceived what lay beyond the eight wilds yet lost both hearing and sight. Lie Yukou studied for nine years until his bones and flesh dissolved—who but those who exhaust the divine and fathom the subtlest could achieve this?\n\nThe Grand Steward of Shang was deeply perplexed by the Sage of the West and believed he had been deceived by Liezi.

      "translated_text": "Minister Jiang Yu, an Inner College Student of Hangzhou Prefecture, Song Dynasty, presents:\n\n*Tang’s Inquiry*\n\nTang of Yin asked Xia Ge: “Did things exist in the earliest antiquity?”\nXia Ge replied: “In the earliest antiquity, there were no things. How could there be things now? Would later generations be right to say that there are no things now?”\n*Explication*: Only after the existence of Heaven and Earth did the myriad things come to be. The myriad things fill the space between Heaven and Earth, and tracing their origin, they share a single qi. The movement of this qi is without end, and thus the generation of the myriad things continues without interruption. Through transformation and ceaseless flux, they change day by day and month by month. The names “now” and “ancient” are but provisional, and the presence or absence of things—how does it differ between now and ancient times?\n\nThat Tang, endowed with Heaven-bestowed wisdom, should pose this question to Xia Ge is because the transmission from the Three Sages—Yao, Shun, and Yu—reached Tang, and though the transition from Xia to Shang arose from adapting to the times, it was unprecedented in antiquity. To use what exists now to verify what did not exist in ancient times, and to trace it upward to the era of Fuxi, is to see the Dao gradually recede into simplicity and return to the primordial. Thus, the question of whether things had presence or absence in antiquity is the meaning of Tang’s inquiry to Xia Ge.\n\nTang of Yin said: “Then do things have no before or after?”\nXia Ge replied: “The beginning and end of things have no ultimate limit. What was a beginning may become an end, and what was an end may become a beginning. How can one know their order? Yet beyond things and before events, this is what I do not know.”\n*Explication*: Viewed through form, things disperse into myriad distinctions. The past does not recognize the present, nor the future the past. Even in the briefest breath of coming and going, one cannot disorder their sequence of before and after. Viewed through nature, things are one in their true essence. What was a beginning may become an end, and what was an end may become a beginning. Even the covering and bearing of Heaven and Earth do not know the before or after of things.\n\nExamining the transformations of things: the sparrow hawk becomes the goshawk, the goshawk becomes the cuckoo, and the cuckoo in time reverts to the sparrow hawk. The end of the sparrow hawk is the beginning of the goshawk; the end of the goshawk is the beginning of the cuckoo; and the end of the cuckoo is the beginning of the sparrow hawk again. This extends to the putrid transforming into the wondrous, and the wondrous reverting to the putrid. In their arising, none know whence they come; in their transformation, none know whither they go. It is like the coming and going of the sun and moon, the succession of the four seasons—does day precede night, or autumn precede spring? None can know their order. For all are confined within creation, equal within the turning wheel. How then can there be any distinction of before or after? To know what comes first, must one not look to that which is beyond things and events, and is undifferentiated and complete? Yet beyond things and before events, it is dark and obscure, silent and still—how could wisdom ever know it? Thus, he says, “This is what I do not know.”\n\nTang of Yin said: “Then do the eight directions above and below have limits?”\nGe replied: “I do not know.”\nTang pressed him further.\nGe said: “If there is nothing, then there is no limit; if there is something, then there is an end. How could I know this? Yet beyond the limitless there is no further limitlessness, and within the endless there is no further endlessness. Beyond the limitless there is no further limitlessness, and within the endless there is no further endlessness. Thus, I know it is limitless and endless, but I do not know that it has limits or ends.”\n*Explication*: If there is nothing, then there is no limit; if there is something, then there is an end. Knowing this, the limitlessness of the eight directions above and below becomes self-evident. Yet reckoning that Heaven and Earth exist within the Great Void, though they have not departed from things, they are the greatest of things. Though greatest, they are still things. Thus, their existence differs from the existence of other things. One cannot call them limited, for they are vast; nor can one call them endless, for they exist. To say they are difficult to exhaust or fathom—this is nearly correct. Thus, Xia Ge says: “Beyond the limitless there is no further limitlessness, and within the endless there is no further endlessness.” The limitless and endless—this is already the utmost. That within the limitless and endless there is no further limitlessness or endlessness is how one perceives the magnitude of Heaven and Earth. Yet this so-called “nothing” is not true nothingness, but rather the absence of form. To call it “nothing” is to dispel the notion of “something.” Since Heaven and Earth have not departed from existence, one borrows “nothing” to reveal their vastness. In the end, however, since they already exist, they will return to an end. Thus, the beginning and end are ultimately lodged in the unknown.\n\nTang further asked: “What exists beyond the four seas?”\nGe replied: “The same as the Central States.”\nTang said: “How do you verify this?”\nGe replied: “When I traveled east to Ying, the people were the same. Asking about what lay east of Ying, it was still like Ying. When I traveled west to Bin, the people were the same. Asking about what lay west of Bin, it was still like Bin. From this, I know that the four seas, the four wastes, and the four poles are no different.”\n*Explication*: The “uniformity of the four seas” refers to the Central States, where Heaven and Earth unite, the four seasons intersect, wind and rain gather, and yin and yang harmonize. Ying lies to the east of the sun, where shadows lengthen at dusk and winds are frequent; Bin lies to the west of the sun, where shadows lengthen at dawn and clouds are common. Though the land is remote and customs differ, the nature of the people is no different from that of the Central States. West of Bin and east of Ying, the land is even farther from the nourishing rains, yet the people are still no different from those of the Central States. Thus, beyond the four seas—though beyond the reach of footprints, boats, or carts—by inferring from one nature to another, why wait to see or hear before knowing? Thus, the great and small contain one another without end. That which contains the myriad things is like that which contains Heaven and Earth. Since it contains the myriad things, it is inexhaustible.",

      "translated_text": "That which contains Heaven and Earth is thus without limit. How do I know that beyond Heaven and Earth there are not greater Heaven and Earth? This, too, is what I do not know.\n\n**Explanation:** Within a single body, a single hair is contained by the skin, the skin by the whole, and the hundred parts by the body. Though a single hair is minute, it possesses the wholeness of the body; though it serves the function of the whole, it does not discard the combined use of the hundred parts. As for things: the pygmy cicada dwells within a mosquito’s eyelash, while the leviathan Peng soars through Heaven and Earth. The pygmy cicada is not deficient compared to the Peng, nor does the Peng have excess over the pygmy cicada—great and small contain one another, and that is all.\n\nYet the measure of things is easily exhausted, so what they contain has limits. Heaven and Earth are supremely vast, and what they contain is inexhaustible. Heaven and Earth still have form, but the Dao that contains them is without limit. Moreover, in speaking of great and small containing one another, it is evident that the great can contain the small, but how can the small contain the great? It is said that Heaven and Earth contain the myriad things, which can be perceived in form, yet what contains them is the Dao. Speaking in terms of the Dao, even the tiniest mustard seed contains the subtlety of Heaven and Earth.

Things have deficiencies, which is why in ancient times Nüwa refined the five-colored stones to mend their flaws.\n\n**Explanation:** Viewed through the principle of great and small containing one another, it is clear that Heaven and Earth are merely things. Being things, how could they be without formation or decay? This is why they have deficiencies that can be mended. The five colors are the essence of the Five Phases; stones are the firm and refined qi of earth.

      "translated_text": "The explanation states: Heaven and Earth drift within the Great Void, floating and utterly minute—no more than a single thing borne upon the giant turtle’s back. Since they are deficient and mendable, this floating state first comes to rest and ceases movement. Thus the turtle’s legs could be severed, the Four Pillars established, and the positions of above and below, the eight directions, made immutable.\n\nLater, Gonggong contended with Zhuanxu for the throne. Enraged, he struck Mount Buzhou, breaking the Pillar of Heaven and severing the Cords of Earth. Hence Heaven tilted to the northwest, and the sun, moon, and stars moved there; Earth sank in the southeast, and the hundred rivers and floodwaters flowed there.\n\nThe explanation states: The Pillar of Heaven is what Heaven relies upon to stand centered and not lean; the Cords of Earth are what Earth depends upon to maintain its four bounds and not collapse. This is the Dao before it departed from primordial undifferentiation. When the Dao descended and unified, one sign foretold the birth of Heaven and Earth. Once Heaven and Earth took their places, humanity emerged between them. Amidst the naturalness of emptiness and non-being, false clarity arose, giving rise to sameness and difference. Once sameness and difference were established, love and aversion intertwined. With love and aversion arose, contention and strife took root, and the qi of anger and resentment prevailed, destroying the Dao’s all-pervading completeness.\n\nThis is why Gonggong contended with Zhuanxu for the throne and struck Mount Buzhou. When the Pillar of Heaven was broken and the Cords of Earth severed, Heaven and Earth split, and the intermingling of their two primal qi made generation and transformation manifest. Thus Heaven tilted to the northwest, and the sun, moon, and stars moved there; Earth sank in the southeast, and the hundred rivers and floodwaters flowed there.\n\nThe northwest is the direction to which the myriad things return to their root. As the sun, moon, and stars move to the northwest, the essence of utmost yin converges below and is offered above, enabling the myriad things to draw upon its qi to live. The southeast is the direction in which the myriad things spread and flourish. As Earth does not fill the southeast, the essence of utmost yang converges above and descends below, enabling the myriad things to draw upon its moisture to take form.\n\nThus Heaven possesses essence, Earth possesses form; Heaven has its eight guiding principles, Earth its five measures, and together they become the mother of the myriad things. In humans, the right ear and eye are not as keen as the left, and the left hand and foot are not as strong as the right. Among things, though their forms and bodies undergo ten thousand changes, none can transgress the proper course of their transformation.\n\nTang further asked: Do things have greatness and smallness? Do they have length and brevity? Do they have sameness and difference?",

      "translated_text": "Ge said: To the east of the Bohai Sea, beyond countless millions of *li*, there lies a great abyss, a truly bottomless valley called the Returning Gully. The waters of the Eight Vastnesses and Nine Wildernesses, along with the celestial Milky Way’s currents, all pour into it—yet it neither swells nor diminishes.\n\nWithin it stand five mountains: the first is Daiyu, the second Yuanqiao, the third Fanghu, the fourth Yingzhou, and the fifth Penglai. Each mountain rises and winds for thirty thousand *li*, its flat summit spanning nine thousand *li*. The distance between their midpoints is seventy thousand *li*, yet they stand as neighbors.\n\nExplanation: Water is used as a metaphor for the Dao. The Dao, as a thing, is so vast it cannot be encompassed, so deep it cannot be fathomed—yet it is the source from which all good things arise. Thus the great abyss is truly a bottomless valley, called the Returning Gully. The great origin of the Dao is all-encompassing; though heaven and humanity pour into it, it never overflows. Therefore, the waters of the Eight Vastnesses and Nine Wildernesses, along with the celestial Milky Way’s currents, all flow into it—yet it neither swells nor diminishes.\n\nThe image of mountains dwelling within it does not depart from the great origin of the Dao, for they are the source of the myriad transformations and the abode of immortals and sages. *Yu* (Daiyu) pertains to the nature of wood; *qiao* (Yuanqiao) to the sharpness of fire; *fang* (Fanghu) to the substance of metal; *zhou* (Yingzhou) to the category of water; and Penglai to the principle of earth. The names of these mountains—some denoting affairs, some resembling things—do not share a single meaning, yet none depart from the principles of the Five Phases.\n\nThe number ten thousand signifies fullness, symbolizing the completeness of the Dao. All numbers begin with one, are established by three, completed by five, flourish at seven, and reside at nine. One, three, five, seven, and nine are all yang numbers, the path of transformation. Thus, the numbers in this passage are used as metaphors for the Dao.\n\nUpon these mountains, their terraces and pavilions are all of gold and jade; their birds and beasts are pure white. Trees of pearl and coral grow in clusters, their blossoms and fruits all imbued with flavor. Those who eat of them never age or die. The inhabitants are all of the lineage of immortals and sages; day and night, those who fly back and forth among them are beyond counting.\n\nExplanation: The immortals and sages, their true essence undisturbed, thus manifest transformations: their terraces and pavilions are all of gold and jade, their birds and beasts pure white, their trees of pearl and coral clustered together, their blossoms and fruits likewise. Moreover, their blossoms and fruits transform naturally, neither splitting their husks in spring nor ripening in autumn. Thus, those who eat of them do not follow decay in its changes, nor do they grow old and die with transformation’s passing.\n\nThe bodies of immortals and sages are utterly empty and unburdened, so they constantly fly back and forth. From this, we may observe: hills and brambles, perils and evils—these are not uniform. How do we know they are not self-created by the human heart?\n\nYet the roots of the five mountains have no fixed attachment, forever rising and falling with the tides, never resting even for a moment. The immortals and sages, distressed by this, appealed to the Emperor. Fearing the mountains would drift to the western extreme and lose the dwelling of the assembled sages, the Emperor commanded Yuqiang to dispatch fifteen giant turtles to lift their heads and bear the mountains. They took turns in three shifts, exchanging every sixty thousand years. Only then did the five mountains stand firm and unmoving.",

      "translated_text": "A commentary states: Since the inability to stand firm even for a moment was deemed intolerable, while steadfast immobility was deemed secure, they necessarily relied upon humans and resorted to creatures to attain that stability. This is why the immortals and sages appealed to the Emperor, and why the Emperor commanded Yuqiang to act. Yuqiang is a divine spirit of the northern realm. Turtles serve as his envoys, thus Yuqiang dispatched the giant turtles to lift their heads and bear the mountains. Yet even these giant turtles, though mighty, possess limited strength, and their exertion must eventually falter. Therefore, their forces had to be combined, taking turns in three shifts, before they could sustain the weight.\n\nOnce a thing has been employed and relied upon for stability, that very thing must harbor what may harm it—and in turn, it may become harmful to us. Thus, alongside such turtles, there arose the kingdom of Longbo, whose people could hook six turtles with a single cast, hoist them upon their backs, and return home to sear their bones for divination. In the land of Longbo dwelt giants who, in fewer than a few strides, could reach the five mountains. With one cast, they hooked six turtles, bundled them together, hastened back to their kingdom, and seared their bones for divination. Thereupon, the two mountains Daiyu and Yuanqiao drifted to the northern pole and sank into the great sea, displacing countless immortals and sages. The Emperor, enraged, diminished the kingdom of Longbo to straiten its borders and shrank its people to shorten their stature. By the time of Fuxi and Shennong, the people of that land still measured several dozen *zhang* in height.\n\nA commentary states: Daiyu and Yuanqiao are mountains of the southeast. The earth does not fill the southeast, so these two mountains drifted and sank. Having sunk into the great sea at the northern pole, they returned to their primordial origin and reverted to the heart of the supreme Dao. Thus, the immortals and sages lost their dwelling and were scattered. Later ages saw manifest governance, which is why the Emperor’s wrath flared and the great principles of the ancients became obscured.\n\nFour hundred thousand *li* east of the Central States lies the kingdom of Jiao Yao, whose people stand but a foot and a half tall. Farther northeast dwell the Zhenren, who measure nine inches. South of Jing lies the realm of Mingling, where five hundred years make a spring and five hundred years an autumn. In high antiquity grew the Great Chun, for which eight thousand years make a spring and eight thousand years an autumn. Upon rotting soil sprout fungi and mushrooms that live from dawn to dusk. In the months of spring and summer appear midges, born with the rain and perishing at the sight of the sun.\n\nNorth of the northernmost lands lies the Dark Sea, a celestial lake. There dwells a fish spanning thousands of *li* in breadth, its length commensurate, called the Kun. There also dwells a bird called the Peng, whose wings resemble clouds trailing from the sky, its body proportionate. Who in the world knows of such creatures? Great Yu encountered them in his travels, Boyi recognized and named them, and Yijian recorded them in his annals.\n\nAlong the riverbanks between the Yangtze and the sea breed tiny insects called Jiaoming. They swarm and alight upon the eyelashes of mosquitoes without touching them. They come and go, roosting and departing, yet the mosquito remains unaware. Li Zhu and Zi Yu, though they rubbed their eyes and raised their brows to peer by day, could not discern their form. Jiao Hu and Yu, Shi Kuang, though they cupped their ears and bent their heads to listen by night, could not catch their sound. Only the Yellow Emperor and Rongchengzi, dwelling upon Kongtong, fasted together for three months, stilling their hearts and abandoning their forms, then slowly perceived with their spirit and beheld them as clearly as the slopes of Mount Song; slowly they listened with their *qi* and heard them as resoundingly as thunder.\n\nIn the lands of Wu and Chu stands a great tree called the You. Its leaves are jade-green and sprout in winter; its fruit is cinnabar-red and tastes sour. Consuming its bark and sap cures the ailment of *fenjue*. The Central States prize it, yet when carried north across the Huai River, it transforms into the trifoliate orange. The stork does not cross the Ji River; the raccoon dog dies if it crosses the Wen River—such is the nature of earthly *qi*.\n\nNevertheless, though forms and *qi* differ, their natures are the same, and none can alter another. All life attains wholeness, and all portions are sufficient. How then do I discern their vastness or smallness, their length or brevity, their sameness or difference?\n\nA commentary states: The myriad things fill the space between heaven and earth. They arise in different regions, transform at different times, and vary in their changes and measures. From the animate to the still, from the flying to the hidden, their shapes and forms are boundless. Can they ever be fully fathomed? Tracing them to their source, the workings of creation upon the ten thousand things all stem from spontaneity. And how can the ten thousand things choose their lot within creation? Whether they become an insect’s limb or a rat’s liver, they abide where they are placed.\n\nAs humans, born in the kingdom of Longbo, they cannot but be tall; as Jiao Yao or Zhenren, they cannot but be small. Among plants, as Mingling or Great Chun in Jing, they live long; as fungi upon rotting soil, they die young. Among animals, as Kun and Peng in the far north, they grow vast; as tiny insects along the riverbanks, they remain minute. The great do not exceed their nature by virtue of their size, nor do the small fall short of their nature by virtue of their smallness. Though long-lived, they must still perish, unable to add what their nature lacks; though short-lived, they still live, unable to diminish what their nature possesses. The trifoliate orange does not cross the Huai, the stork does not cross the Ji, the raccoon dog does not cross the Wen—all are constrained by earthly *qi*, yet their natures remain unalterable.\n\nThe chapter \"Free and Easy Wandering\" in the *Zhuangzi* elucidates this principle. I have often pondered: among creatures, none are greater than the giant turtles. Observe how they lift their heads to bear the mountains Daiyu and Yuanqiao—truly wondrous! Yet they cannot escape the fate of having their bones seared, so what advantage does their greatness confer? Among creatures, none are more minute than the Jiaoming. Though Li Zhu, Zi Yu, Jiao Hu, Yu, and Shi Kuang could neither see nor hear them, when the Yellow Emperor and Rongchengzi perceived them with spirit and listened with *qi*, they revealed an immeasurable vastness. Thus, what harm lies in smallness?",

The Foolish Old Man of North Mountain, nearly ninety years of age, dwelled facing the mountains.

Moved by their sincerity, the Emperor commanded the two sons of Kuafu to bear the two mountains away—one placed east of Shuō, the other south of Yōng.

With descendants unending and the mountain never growing, to level the perilous heights, open the road south of Yù, and reach the northern bank of the Hàn—this principle too is credible. Having both the principle and perfect sincerity, even the Spirit Who Grasps the Serpent, bravest of beings, heard and knew fear. The Emperor’s loftiness likewise was moved by their sincerity. Thus, though the Foolish Old Man and his frail child were weak, they could clear the ridges south of Jì and north of the Hàn. Moreover, it was precisely because they were the Foolish Old Man and his frail child that these ridges were removed: the old man’s thoughts were gentle and his sincerity absolute, while the child’s will was single-minded, his qi soft and unadulterated—this is how they moved heaven and earth, stirred gods and spirits.\n\nHad they harbored inner doubts in the prime of their strength, they would have calculated their power insufficient to level even Kuífù’s mound and abandoned the task—this is why the old man’s wife voiced her doubts, and why the Wise Old Man of the River Bend laughed and sought to stop them.\n\nIn life, our vain calculations, the growth of the self, and the slow decay of the body—how are these barriers to the Dao any less than two mountains blocking the way?

      "translated_text": "**Exposition:**\n\nWhat, after all, is the sun’s shadow? To pursue it without measuring one’s strength is to be enslaved by delusion. From delusion arises craving; with craving lodged within, even draining the Yellow River and the Wèi cannot quench the scorching heat of thirst—thus he perished on the road. Only after his death did he cast aside his staff. Where his flesh and fat soaked the earth, the Dèng Forest sprang forth, spreading for thousands of miles. Yet the moisture from a single body, seeping into the abandoned staff, could nourish a forest of thousands of miles, while it could not moisten his own parched bones—such is the ruin wrought by delusion.\n\n*Explication of the* **Perfect Virtue of the Primal Void***, Scroll Nine—Concluded*\n*Explication of the* **Perfect Virtue of the Primal Void***, Scroll Ten*\n*Presented by your subject Jiang Yu, an Inner Student of the Hangzhou Prefectural Academy*\n\n---\n\n**Yǔ’s Inquiry**\n\nThe Great Yǔ said: “Within the Six Directions and the Four Seas, all is illumined by sun and moon, ordered by the stars, regulated by the four seasons, and governed by the Great Year. The beings born of the numinous take myriad forms—some die young, some live long—only the sage can fathom their Way.”\n\nXià Gé replied: “Yet there are those who arise without relying on the numinous, take form without depending on yin and yang, shine without awaiting sun and moon, perish without violence, live long without cultivation, eat without the five grains, clothe themselves without silk or floss, and move without boats or chariots. Their Way is spontaneous, beyond even the sage’s comprehension.”\n\n**Exposition:**\n\nWhen it is said that only the sage can fathom their Way, this does not mean the sage delights in comprehending things—rather, the Way is such that nothing lies beyond it. As for that which the sage cannot comprehend, it is not that the sage is incapable, but that the Way is naturally so, requiring no act of comprehension. Yet it is only because there exists that which the sage cannot comprehend that there arises what the sage *can* comprehend.\n\nWhen Yǔ governed the waters and lands, he lost his way and strayed into a foreign realm. North of the Northern Sea, beyond countless thousands of miles from Qí Province, lay a land called Zhōngběi. Its borders were unbounded, untouched by wind, rain, frost, or dew. No birds, beasts, insects, fish, grasses, or trees grew there. All was level, encircled by towering ridges.\n\n**Exposition:**\n\nThe north is the direction of darkness, where the myriad things withdraw, where the True One converges, and where the utmost spirit dwells. North of the Northern Sea lies the land of Zhōngběi—refined beyond refinement, numinous beyond the numinous. Unconfined by direction, it has no fixed borders. Unenslaved by qi, it knows no transformations of yin and yang. Independent of things, it produces no creatures, plant or animal. All is level—its Way utterly even. Encircling ridges leave no gaps beyond. How could even the divine Yǔ have reached such a land? Even he, had he not lost his way, could never have arrived, for it lies beyond the reach of foot, strength, boat, or chariot.\n\nAt the land’s center stood a mountain named Húlǐng, shaped like a carrying-pole with jars suspended at either end. At its summit was an opening like a ring, called the *Zī* Cavern. A spring gushed forth, named the *Shénfèn*, its fragrance surpassing orchid and pepper, its taste exceeding fine wine. From a single source, it divided into four channels, flowing down the mountain to irrigate the entire land. The soil’s qi was harmonious, and no plagues arose. The people’s nature was gentle, yielding to things without contention. Their hearts were soft, their bones weak—neither proud nor envious. Young and old dwelled together without rulers or subjects. Men and women wandered freely, without matchmakers or betrothals. They lived along the waters, neither plowing nor sowing. The soil’s warmth was just right, so they neither wove nor wore clothes. They lived a hundred years, neither dying young nor falling ill. Their population flourished without count, ever joyful, untouched by sorrow, aging, or suffering. Fond of song, they clasped hands and sang in turns, their voices never ceasing. When hungry or weary, they drank the *Shénfèn*, and their strength and spirits became peaceful. If they overindulged, they grew drunk, waking only after ten days. Bathing in the *Shénfèn*, their skin became sleek and glossy, their fragrance lingering for ten days.\n\n**Exposition:**\n\nAt the center, above, hollow yet unobstructed, its flow endless, its outflow inexhaustible—such is the *Shénfèn* of the *Zī* Cavern, ever nourishing the myriad things. Its fragrance surpasses orchid and pepper, its taste exceeds fine wine—so its Way spreads, its scent delighting the heart. Irrigating the entire land, it is present in all things without exception. The absence of plagues shows its perfect harmony undispersed. The people’s gentle nature arises from the pure qi held within. Soft hearts mean the spirit is concentrated; weak bones mean the form is released. Young and old dwelling together, men and women mingling freely—such people know no marriage or officialdom. Neither plowing nor sowing, neither weaving nor wearing clothes—such people need no garments or food. Living a hundred years, they meet their end in due course. Their population flourishes, their life endless. Clasping hands and singing in turns, each attains true joy. Their ability to live thus stems from drinking the *Shénfèn* to transform their inner selves and bathing in it to permeate their outer forms.\n\nWhen King Mù of Zhōu journeyed north and passed through this land, he forgot to return for three years. Upon his return to the Zhōu court, he longed for the land, lost in melancholy. He refused wine and meat, summoned no concubines, and only after months did he recover.\n\nGuǎn Zhòng urged Duke Huán of Qí to journey through Liáokǒu, intending to reach this land and nearly succeeding. Xí Péng remonstrated: “My lord, you abandon the vastness of Qí, its teeming people, its scenic mountains and rivers, its abundant resources, its flourishing rites and music, its splendid robes, its palace filled with beauties, its court brimming with loyal ministers. With a shout, a million soldiers rise; with a gesture, the feudal lords obey. Why envy that land and forsake Qí’s altars of soil and grain to follow the ways of barbarians?”",

When these proved insufficient, he turned north to drink from the Great Marsh, but before he reached it, he died of thirst on the way. He cast aside his staff, and where his flesh and fat soaked the earth, the Dèng Forest grew, spreading for thousands of miles.",

      "translated_text": "Duke Huán, taking Xí Péng’s words to heart, desisted, and relayed them to Guǎn Zhòng. Guǎn Zhòng replied: “This is truly beyond Péng’s comprehension. I fear that land is beyond all knowing. Why cling to Qí’s wealth? Why heed Péng’s words?”\n\nThe explanation follows: King Mù of Zhōu once roamed as a spirit with a *huà-rén*, hence his later unrestrained wanderings, during which he passed through that land. For three years he forgot to return—such is the reception of those who are spiritually attuned. Yet upon his return, after mere months, he resumed wine and meat, summoned his concubines, and sought what was no longer of the spirit. From the sage-king Yǔ to King Mù’s time, governance shifted through the phases of loyalty, substance, and refinement, yet Mù’s journey and Yǔ’s arrival in that land revealed no difference in what they witnessed. Is this not proof that the workings of the spirit alone endure and remain whole?\n\nHow could the hegemony of Duke Huán or the worthiness of Xí Péng fathom this? Their narrow view of Qí’s proximity, believing nothing surpasses it, leads them to dismiss me as senile—like a frog in a shallow well, exulting in its pit’s joys, unaware of the Eastern Sea’s vast delight.\n\nIn the southern lands, people wear their hair loose and go bare; in the north, they wrap their heads and don furs; in the Central States, they wear caps and robes. Across the nine regions, livelihoods vary—some farm, some trade, some hunt, some fish—like winter furs and summer linen, boats for water and carts for land. These are acquired, shaped by nature, and made one’s own.\n\nEast of Yuè lies the land of Zhéxiū, where the eldest son, at birth, is sliced and eaten, deemed “fitting for younger brothers.” When a grandfather dies, they carry the grandmother away and abandon her, saying, “A ghost-wife cannot share a dwelling.” South of Chǔ lies the land of the Yán people, where upon a relative’s death, the flesh is left to rot before the bones are buried—only then is one called a filial son. West of Qín lies the land of Yíqú, where the dead are piled with wood and burned. The rising smoke is called “ascending afar,” and only then is one deemed filial. Such practices are upheld as governance above and custom below, yet they are not deemed strange.\n\nThe explanation follows: Where the five administrations extend and the seven tributes sustain, where heaven and earth converge, lies the Central States—hence its people wear caps and robes. Farmers, merchants, hunters, and fishers; winter furs and summer linen; boats and carts—all their deeds align with the central Way. Yet where the land leans toward yin or yang, so too do its customs. Thus, the southern lands, scorched by heat, favor loose hair and bare skin, while the northern lands, gripped by cold, wrap their heads and wear furs. In the farthest reaches of the four seas, the four wastes, the four poles, there exist lands like Zhémù, Yán, and Yíqú, where customs defy what eyes and ears know, startling human reason. Upheld as governance and embraced as custom, lived without doubt—all shaped by yin and yang. How deeply habit and custom can confound!\n\nConfucius, traveling east, saw two children arguing and asked the reason. One child said: “I believe the sun is nearer at dawn and farther at noon.” The other insisted the sun was farther at dawn and nearer at noon. The first child argued: “At dawn, the sun is as large as a carriage canopy, but by noon it is like a plate—does this not prove that what is far appears small, and what is near appears large?” The second child countered: “At dawn, the sun is cool and refreshing, but by noon it is scalding like boiling water—does this not prove that what is near is hot, and what is far is cool?” Confucius could not decide. The children laughed: “Who says you are so wise?”\n\nThe explanation follows: The sun clings to the heavens and revolves with them. Above and below, in all eight directions, boundless and endless, impossible to exhaust—how can its distance be measured in an instant? The *Yuánmìng Bāo* states: “Heaven is incomplete in the northwest; yang culminates at nine, hence heaven’s circuit spans nine times nine, eighty-one myriad *lǐ*.” The *Lì Jì* says: “Numbers begin at one, stand at three, complete at five, flourish at seven, and rest at nine—thus heaven is nine myriad *lǐ* from earth.” Both schools inherit this teaching. If one accepts their claims, does it not align with the idea that what is near is hot and what is far is cool? Yet when tested against the carriage-canopy and plate analogy, it does not hold.\n\nThus, when the sun emerges from Fú Sāng as morning light, it is cool and refreshing, likened to a carriage canopy. When it faces Kūn Wú at high noon, it is like boiling water, likened to a plate. What should be large appears small; what should be cool feels warm; what should be near seems far. Though the children’s wisdom was slight, even they were confounded by these contradictions. To fathom the reason, even Confucius’s wisdom could not resolve it.\n\nFor the sun is like the Dao: deem it distant, and one may grasp it in a breath; deem it near, and one may remain lost for a lifetime. Speak of its vastness, and its use fills the void; speak of its smallness, and its absence goes unnoticed. Thus, to judge the sun by size is the mark of ignorance; to seek the Dao in refinement or coarseness is to not know the Dao.\n\nConsider this: if one seeks fire from the sun using a fire-drill, it arrives in an instant—where then is the distinction between dawn and noon, near and far? Yet size and distance remain unfathomable—this is the sun’s mystery, its ceaseless motion through the ages.\n\nWas Confucius truly unable to decide? He left it unexamined. The children hastily declared Confucius unwise, yet Confucius himself said: *“Do I possess knowledge? I possess no knowledge.”* If Confucius were truly wise, why would he be Confucius?",

      "translated_text": "The petty squabbling over the sun’s size and distance is but childish bickering. *Equality*—this is the supreme principle of the world.\n\n**Explanation:** To equalize the myriad things, allowing no distinction of high or low, is to merge self and other into oneness. In oneness, one aligns with the Dao—this is the supreme principle of the world. Hence, Zhuangzi’s *\"On the Equality of Things.\"*\n\nThe same holds for physical objects. When a hair is evenly suspended, it may bear weight until it snaps—but if truly balanced, it will never break. Some dismiss this, yet there are those who understand its truth.\n\n**Explanation:** In physical matters, the few cannot overcome the many, nor can the weak subdue the strong—this much is certain. Yet if one grasps the principle of *equality* and applies it, even the faintest hair can draw a thousand *jun* without snapping. Those who deny this are shackled by things; those who recognize it have penetrated the principle. Physical connections are but trifles—if one attains *equality*, the small can thus control the great. How much more so when one achieves the great *equality* of the supreme principle? What then could not be accomplished?\n\nZhan He once used a single silkworm’s thread for a line, a needle’s barb for a hook, a stalk of *jing* bamboo for a rod, and a grain of rice for bait—yet he drew fish as large as a cart from an abyss a hundred *ren* deep, amidst rushing currents, without the line breaking, the hook bending, or the rod warping. The King of Chu, hearing of this, summoned him in astonishment and asked the reason.\n\nZhan He replied: \"I once heard my late master speak of Pu Juezi’s archery. With a weak bow and slender cord, he rode the wind and struck, bringing down two cormorants in the azure sky. His mind was focused, his hand in perfect balance. I took this as my model and practiced angling, spending five years mastering its way. When I stand by the river with rod in hand, my mind is free of distractions, fixed only on the fish. Casting the line and sinking the hook, my hand makes no distinction of light or heavy—nothing can disturb it. The fish see my hook and bait as mere drifting dust or foam, swallowing without hesitation. Thus, I can use the weak to control the strong, the light to draw the heavy.\"\n\n\"If Your Majesty governs the state with such skill, the world could be held in the palm of your hand—what further effort would be needed?\"\n\nThe King of Chu said: \"Well said.\"\n\n**Explanation:** Using the weak to control the strong, the weak must break; using the light to draw the heavy, the light must be crushed. Why? Because their power is unequal. Yet if I, though weak, leverage the other’s strength to control it, that strength will not oppose me but serve me—thus, strength lies with me, and weakness with the other. Though I am light, if I harness the other’s weight to govern it, that weight will not contend with me but obey me—thus, weight lies with me, and lightness with the other. Then who can say the weak cannot control the strong, or the light draw the heavy? This is the principle by which Zhan He, with silk thread and needle-hook, drew cart-sized fish from an abyss a thousand *ren* deep, and Pu Juezi, with a weak bow and slender cord, brought down two cormorants in the azure sky.\n\nAh! Angling and archery are different arts, yet governance is not so distinct. Zhan He learned angling from Pu Juezi’s archery, then used it to instruct the King of Chu in statecraft. For one who attains the supreme principle of *equality*, though things may shift endlessly, how could they escape this principle? This is what Zhuangzi meant by *\"Unify all things, and ten thousand affairs are complete.\"* Thus, the sage, with a body as insignificant as dust, governs the world as if holding it in one hand—how could this apply only to the state of Chu?\n\nGonghu of Lu and Qi Ying of Zhao both fell ill and together sought Bian Que’s treatment.

      "translated_text": "Once their illnesses were cured together, Bian Que said to Gonghu and Qi Ying: \"The ailments you suffered before were external invasions of your organs, which medicine and stone could remedy. Now, however, you bear congenital afflictions that have grown with your bodies. If I were to treat these for you, how would that be?\" The two replied, \"We would first like to hear the evidence.\"\n\nBian Que said to Gonghu: \"Your will is strong but your *qi* is weak, so you excel in planning yet falter in decisiveness.\" To Qi Ying he said: \"Your will is weak but your *qi* is strong, so you lack forethought and err in inflexibility. If I were to exchange your hearts, both would attain balance in virtue.\"\n\nThereupon, Bian Que gave them a poisoned wine to drink, rendering them unconscious for three days. He then opened their chests, extracted their hearts, exchanged them, and restored them. Applying a divine medicine, they awoke as before.\n\nHe explained: \"Deliberation resides in the will, while decisiveness belongs to *qi*. The will commands *qi*—when the will is sufficient to lead *qi*, its expression is always measured. When the will is insufficient to command *qi*, it becomes enslaved to *qi* and disturbs the heart. Thus, excessive *qi* leads to inflexibility, while weak *qi* results in indecision.\n\nI have often said that the will lies within oneself, untouched by transformation. Yet by clinging to the notion of a fixed self, one cherishes life and clings to the body. In cherishing the body, one becomes its servant. This is why Gonghu and Qi Ying’s will and thought were governed by the strength or weakness of their *qi* and physical form. That one’s will and thought should be enslaved to *qi* and body—truly, this is lamentable. Yet Bian Que could cure their ailments and alter the workings of creation—how wondrous is this!\n\nNow, *Gonghu* suggests domineering arrogance, hence Gonghu’s strong will and aptitude for planning. *Ying* evokes infancy, hence Qi Ying’s weak will and lack of foresight. The two then took their leave and returned home.\n\nThereupon, Gonghu went to Qi Ying’s house and claimed his wife and children, but they did not recognize him. Likewise, Qi Ying went to Gonghu’s house and claimed his wife and children, but they, too, did not recognize him. The two households thus brought suit against each other, seeking Bian Que’s judgment to resolve the dispute. Bian Que explained the cause, and the dispute was settled.\n\nHe expounded: \"Once, when Confucius traveled to Chu, he saw piglets nursing from their dead mother. After a moment, they glanced at one another, abandoned her, and fled. They did not see their mother as herself, nor did they find her like themselves. Thus, if something is not of one’s kind, even piglets will abandon their mother. But if it is of one’s kind, then even if Gonghu and Qi Ying returned to the wrong houses, their families would not doubt them.\n\nNow, after Bian Que exchanged their hearts, only their forms remained enslaved to their original selves. Each returned to the other’s house yet did not recognize that their form was no longer their own. The two households, deceived by the change in appearance, failed to perceive that the two men were now of the other’s kind. Thus, they did not recognize them.\n\nBut tell me: in judging these two men, did the households seek them within their physical forms? Or did they seek them beyond their physical forms? If beyond, then why did they so readily accept Bian Que’s judgment? If within, then when they returned to their houses, how could they not recognize them? Why would they need Bian Que’s intervention?\n\nAlas! From birth to death, the great transformations shift ceaselessly. From old age to infancy, how vastly do appearance, countenance, wisdom, and demeanor differ—far more than the exchange of Gonghu and Qi Ying’s forms! Yet the flow of great transformation is so subtle that people traverse it unawares. Bian Que’s exchange of their hearts was abrupt, so none could fail to be astonished by the change.\n\nMoreover, when Gonghu and Qi Ying’s will and *qi* were exchanged, neither they nor their households could recognize one another. How much more so with the workings of creation upon the ten thousand things—born through transformation, dying through transformation, dying and being reborn without end, with no one knowing its origin! How could people possibly comprehend its reasons?\n\nOnce, when Yang Zhu set out, he wore plain white robes; upon returning, he wore black. His dog, not recognizing him, barked at him. This is why Yang Zhu stopped Yang Bu from beating his dog.\n\nWhen Hu Ba played the zither, birds danced and fish leapt. Hearing this, Zheng Shiwen abandoned his home to study under Master Xiang. For three years, his fingers pressed the strings and hooked the pegs, yet he could not produce a single melody. Master Xiang said, 'You may return home now.'\n\nShiwen set down his zither and sighed: 'It is not that I cannot hook the strings or form melodies. What I seek does not lie in the strings, nor does my aspiration reside in sound. If my heart does not attain it within, and my instrument does not respond without, how dare I lift my hands to move the strings?' He asked for a little more time to observe what would follow.\n\nBefore long, he returned to Master Xiang. 'How is your zither playing now?' Master Xiang asked. Shiwen replied, 'I have attained it. Please, allow me to demonstrate.'\"",

      "translated_text": "Thus, when spring arrived, he struck the *shang* string to summon *Nanlü*, and a cool breeze suddenly arose, causing plants and trees to bear fruit. By autumn, he plucked the *jiao* string to rouse *Jiazhong*, and a warm wind gently swirled, making plants and trees flourish. In summer, he struck the *yu* string to invoke *Huangzhong*, and frost and snow descended together, while rivers and ponds froze over. By winter, he plucked the *zhi* string to stir *Ruibin*, and the sun’s rays blazed fiercely, melting solid ice in an instant.\n\nAs the piece neared its end, he commanded the *gong* string to harmonize the four, and the *jing* wind soared, auspicious clouds floated, sweet dew fell, and spring waters surged. Master Xiang then clapped his chest and leapt in joy, exclaiming, “How subtle is your playing! Even *Qingjiao* of Master Kuang or the pitch-pipes of Zou Yan could not surpass it. They would clutch their zithers and flutes to follow in your wake.”\n\nThe commentary states: The Dao may be transmitted but not received; it may be attained but not seen. Being unseen, it cannot be received; only what can be transmitted may be attained. A good teacher stops at what can be transmitted; a good student is thus able to gain it. In his learning, Shiwen sought to transcend the instrument and awaken to the Dao; in his teaching, Master Xiang used the instrument to convey sound. Therefore, when Master Xiang first sent him home, Shiwen still sought a little more time to observe what would follow. Once he had attained it, he could reverse the workings of creation, alter the sequence of the four seasons, make the *jing* wind soar, auspicious clouds float, sweet dew descend in streams, and spring waters surge—all without ever leaving the moment his fingers moved the strings. Thus, the turning of yin and yang lay within his grasp. How wondrous!\n\nMaster Xiang, at this, clapped his chest and leapt in joy, marveling at its subtlety. Had Shiwen merely followed Master Xiang’s transmissible techniques to become what Master Xiang already knew, he would never have earned such praise. Therefore, though the diligent student may say it is better to seek a teacher, the noble person desires self-attainment.\n\nAlas! If the subtlety of a single art can reach such heights, then one who has attained the Dao could govern the world, bringing peace and prosperity—truly no difficult task.\n\nXue Tan studied singing under Qin Qing but had not mastered his teacher’s art when he declared himself proficient and took his leave. Qin Qing did not stop him but saw him off at the crossroads in the suburbs. There, he struck the rhythm and sang a mournful song, his voice shaking the trees and halting the passing clouds. Xue Tan then apologized and begged to return, never again daring to speak of leaving.\n\nThe commentary states: Those who study the Dao may be like Zheng Shiwen with Master Xiang—unaware of where his aspirations lay, sent home, only to return and earn his teacher’s marveling praise. Or they may be like Xue Tan with Qin Qing—believing they had mastered his art and leaving, only to apologize and beg to return, never again daring to speak of departure. This is what students must discern.\n\nQin Qing turned to his friend and said: “Long ago, Han E traveled east to Qi, running out of provisions. Passing through Yongmen, she sang for food. After she left, her lingering notes coiled around the beams for three days without fading, and the people nearby did not realize she had gone. At an inn, the innkeeper insulted her. Han E then sang a long, mournful lament, and the old and young of the village grieved, weeping and facing one another without eating for three days. They hurried to bring her back, and when she returned, she sang a joyful song. The villagers leapt and danced, unable to contain themselves, forgetting their former sorrow. They then richly rewarded her and sent her on her way. To this day, the people of Yongmen excel in singing and weeping, imitating Han E’s lingering voice.”\n\nThe commentary states: True sorrow is soundless yet mournful; true kinship is not smiling yet harmonious—meaning joy and grief cannot be feigned. Singing for food may not arise from sincere joy, and weeping in response to insult may not be true sorrow. Yet her art was so wondrous that the villagers, who had never known sorrow, wept and refused food upon hearing her lament; and those who had never known joy leapt and danced uncontrollably upon hearing her song. If feigned song and weeping can move people so deeply, how much more so when both performer and listener are genuine?\n\nHowever, her art only worked in the village of Yongmen. Had she sung in Qi, there would surely have been those who recognized its falsity. Thus, her lingering voice was imitated only in Yongmen.\n\nBo Ya was skilled at playing the zither, and Zhong Ziqi was skilled at listening. When Bo Ya played with the intention of climbing a high mountain, Zhong Ziqi said, “How fine! Towering like Mount Tai!” When his intention turned to flowing water, Zhong Ziqi said, “How fine! Vast like the Yangtze and Yellow River!” Whatever Bo Ya conceived, Zhong Ziqi always grasped it.\n\nOnce, Bo Ya traveled to the northern side of Mount Tai. Suddenly, a violent storm arose, and he took shelter beneath a cliff. Overcome with sorrow, he took up his zither and played. First, he composed a piece for the ceaseless rain, then shifted to the sound of crumbling mountains. With each melody, Zhong Ziqi fully understood its essence. Bo Ya then set down his zither and sighed, “How fine! How fine! Your listening is such that your thoughts and images mirror my heart. Where can my music escape you?”\n\nThe commentary states: There are sounds, sounds of sounds, and that which sounds the sounds—all are heard. Once heard, the grandest does not exceed the *gong* note, and the subtlest does not go beyond the *yu*. By examining the purity or turbidity of *gong* and *yu* and comparing them to human affairs, where can sound escape? Thus, Ziqi’s skill in listening is not so extraordinary. Moreover, Bo Ya’s zither gained renown through Ziqi, while Ziqi’s listening would have no outlet for its artistry without Bo Ya. Liezi praised them for valuing the understanding of sound.\n\nYet Ji Zha’s observation of music surpasses even this.\n\n*Explication of the Perfect Dao and Its Virtue, Scroll Ten Concludes*\n*Explication of the Perfect Dao and Its Virtue, Scroll Eleven*",

      "translated_text": "Presented by Jiang Yu, a *hesheng* of the Hangzhou Prefectural Academy of Song, for the imperial perusal.\n\n**Tang Wen**\n\nKing Mu of Zhou, on his western expedition, crossed the Kunlun Mountains but did not reach Yan Mountain. On his return journey, before reaching the Central States, he encountered a craftsman named Yan Shi who offered his services. The king summoned him and asked, “What skills do you possess?”\n\nYan Shi replied, “I shall do as Your Majesty commands. However, I have already created something I wish you to see first.”\n\nThe king said, “Come with it tomorrow, and we shall observe it together.”\n\nThe next day, Yan Shi presented himself to the king. The king summoned him and asked, “Who is the person accompanying you?”\n\nYan Shi answered, “This is my creation, one capable of performing.”\n\nThe king scrutinized it closely. It walked, bowed, and raised itself—truly like a man. When the craftsman pressed its chin, it sang in perfect harmony with the pitch; when he lifted its head, it danced in precise rhythm. Its transformations were boundless, responding to every intention. The king took it for a real person and had his concubine, Lady Sheng, join him in observing it.\n\nAs the performance neared its end, the performer winked at the king’s attendants. Enraged, the king was about to execute Yan Shi on the spot. Terrified, Yan Shi immediately disassembled the performer before the king’s eyes, revealing it to be an assemblage of leather, wood, glue, lacquer, and pigments—white, black, and vermilion. The king examined it closely: within were liver, gallbladder, heart, lungs, spleen, kidneys, intestines, and stomach; without were sinews, bones, joints, skin, hair, teeth, and nails—all artificial yet perfectly formed. When reassembled, it appeared as before.\n\nThe king tested it: when he removed its heart, its mouth could not speak; when he removed its liver, its eyes could not see; when he removed its kidneys, its feet could not walk. Only then did King Mu smile in wonder and say, “Can human craftsmanship truly rival the workings of creation?”\n\nHe ordered a secondary chariot to carry Yan Shi back with him.\n\nBan Shu’s cloud-ladder and Mo Di’s flying kite were once deemed the pinnacle of skill. Yet when their disciples Dongmen Jia and Qin Guli heard of Yan Shi’s craft, they informed their masters, who thereafter never dared speak of their arts again and instead constantly wielded compass and square.\n\n**Commentary:** Though an artificial construct, once taught to perform, it becomes an incitement to licentiousness. Thus, its ability to sing in harmony and dance in rhythm makes its winking unremarkable. Human skill indeed possesses marvels akin to flying kites or jade paper—yet these are mere objects. Man is the spirit of all things; surely he cannot be imitated by such assemblages. Yan Shi’s creation could walk, bow, and raise itself indistinguishably from a human, sing in perfect pitch, dance in exact measure, and transform endlessly at will—only then did it attain supreme mastery. Thus, even the skills of Ban Shu and Mo Di paled in comparison, and they dared not speak of their arts again, instead constantly wielding compass and square.\n\nAlas! Human life—how could its potential be limited to Yan Shi’s craft? Yet men often pass through life without self-awareness, and when they encounter such marvels, they merely admire the skill, missing the deeper truth. How superficial!\n\nGan Ying, an ancient master archer, could draw his bow and cause beasts to crouch and birds to descend. His disciple Fei Wei learned archery from him and surpassed his teacher. Another disciple, Ji Chang, studied under Fei Wei.\n\nFei Wei said, “First learn not to blink, then we may speak of archery.”\n\nJi Chang returned home and lay beneath his wife’s loom, gazing upward at the moving shuttle. After two years, even when a needle’s tip brushed his eyelashes, he did not blink. He reported this to Fei Wei.\n\nFei Wei said, “Not yet. You must learn to see before you can shoot. See the small as large, the faint as clear—then come tell me.”\n\nJi Chang suspended a louse from a window with a hair and gazed at it from the south. Within ten days, it gradually appeared larger. After three years, it seemed as big as a cartwheel. When he looked at other things, they all appeared like hills and mountains. Then, using a bow of Yan horn and an arrow of northern reeds, he shot the louse, piercing its heart while the hair remained unbroken. He reported this to Fei Wei.\n\nFei Wei leapt up, striking his chest, and said, “You have mastered it!”\n\n**Commentary:** Learning not to blink means not allowing external things to alter oneself. Mastering vision means transforming things through perception. If I am not altered by things, but things are transformed by me, then I can see the small as large and the faint as clear—thus, the ability to hit the mark lies within me. This is how Ji Chang pierced the louse.\n\nAfter Ji Chang had mastered Fei Wei’s techniques, he calculated that only one man in the world could rival him and plotted to kill Fei Wei. They met in the wild, and as they exchanged arrows, their shafts collided midair and fell to the ground without raising dust. Fei Wei’s arrows were exhausted first, leaving Ji Chang with one final shot. When he loosed it, Fei Wei deflected it with the tip of a thorn branch, missing not a hair’s breadth. Thereupon, the two men wept, cast aside their bows, and bowed to each other on the road, pledging to become father and son. They swore an oath, cutting their arms, never to teach their arts to others.\n\n**Commentary:** Mencius said, “Is the arrow-maker less humane than the armor-maker?”—meaning one must be cautious in choosing one’s craft. Thus, after Ji Chang mastered Fei Wei’s techniques, he plotted to kill him. For the learning of Ji Chang and the teaching of Fei Wei both ultimately aimed at harming others—this was their inevitable end. When Pang Meng learned archery from Yi and mastered his Way, he too killed Yi—this was the same principle. Mencius deemed Pang Meng’s killing of Yi justified, for Yi bore some blame in choosing unworthy companions. Had one studied archery like Master Gong’s disciple Si, how could one bear to use the Master’s Way to harm him? Fortunate was Fei Wei’s survival! Had he not deflected that final arrow with a thorn branch, he would not have escaped. Thus, the gentleman’s pursuit of learning is the archery of non-archery.\n\nThe teacher of Zaofu was named Tai Dou.",

      "translated_text": "When Zaofu first began his apprenticeship in charioteering, he observed rites with utmost humility, yet Tai Dou remained silent for three years. As Zaofu’s reverence grew ever more meticulous, Tai Dou finally spoke: “The ancient poem says: *The son of a master bowyer must first weave baskets; the son of a master smith must first sew furs.* First observe my gait. When your stride matches mine, then you may take up the six reins and drive the six horses.”\n\nZaofu replied, “I shall follow your command.”\n\nTai Dou then erected wooden planks to form a path, barely wide enough for his feet, measuring each step as he placed them. He walked upon them, pacing back and forth without a single misstep. Zaofu learned this, and in three days mastered its art.\n\nTai Dou sighed, “How swift your grasp! You have attained it with such speed. All charioteering is like this. When you walked just now, your feet responded to your heart. Extend this to driving: harmony in the reins and bit, urgency and ease in the harmony of the lips, proper measure within the breast, and disciplined rhythm in the grip of the hands. When the center is inwardly aligned and outwardly attuned to the horse’s will, you can advance and retreat along the line, turn and curve within the compass, traverse great distances with energy to spare—truly, you have grasped the technique.\n\nWhen the bit is mastered, the reins respond; when the reins are mastered, the hands respond; when the hands are mastered, the heart responds. Then you need not rely on sight, nor urge with the whip. The mind is at ease, the body upright, the six reins unconfused, and the twenty-four hooves land without error. In turning or advancing, retreating or halting, all is in perfect measure. Then the wheels leave no excess track beyond their path, the hooves no ground untouched.

      "translated_text": "A commentary states: In all affairs under heaven, there are those that seem slow yet are urgent, appear delayed yet take precedence. What the foolish fail to perceive, the wise discern. Thus, in the art of charioteering, none do not assume that mastery begins with grasping the reins. Yet the teaching of Taidou first had the student observe its intent—just as archers first learn to see, bowmakers first craft baskets, and smiths first prepare furs. From this we know that even in the most minor of skills, without learning from a master, one will never recognize the essential first step. Even the wise cannot achieve mastery without cause. How swiftly Zaofu mastered the craft in three days! Yet had he not maintained utmost humility, enduring three years without instruction while observing ritual with ever greater care, his learning would not have been sincere, his thought not precise—how could he have attained it so swiftly? Extending what he learned to charioteering, no technique remained unmastered.\n\nNow, to harness horses to a carriage and guide them with reins—six horses, twenty-four hooves—if a single hoof missteps, the excellence of all six is lost. Such is the difficulty of driving. Therefore, the skilled driver does not rely on sight, nor does he urge with the whip. To watch with the eyes is to see ever more confusion and fail to encompass all; to drive with the whip is to exhaust strength without achieving order. Only when inwardly attuned to the heart’s center and outwardly responsive to bit and reins can one remain at ease amid peril or level ground, urgency or leisure, the body ever upright whether advancing, retreating, turning, or curving. Then the wheels leave no excess track beyond their path, the hooves no ground untouched. \"No excess track\" does not mean no track at all, but that the wheels encounter no obstruction; \"no ground untouched\" does not mean no ground remains, but that peril and level ground offer no choice. When driving reaches this point, one no longer knows whether it is the self driving the horse or the horse drawing the carriage—all appears as one. Is this not wondrous? This is how Zaofu could command King Mu’s chariot, roaming freely to distant lands, crossing Kunlun, witnessing the sun’s descent, covering ten thousand *li* in a single day.\n\nAlas! The subtlety of charioteering is profound indeed. Its art attains such marvels—how can mere \"skill\" suffice to name it? If Zaofu were to cast aside his reins and apply his mastery to the Dao, who could say it were impossible?\n\nYangzi said: \"He who rules all under heaven must examine his driving.\" Examine this alone.\n\nWei Hei Luan killed Qiu Bingzhang out of personal enmity. Bingzhang’s son, Laidan, sought to avenge his father’s death. Laidan’s *qi* was fierce, his form exposed; he ate by counting grains and moved with the wind. Though enraged, he could not wield weapons to exact revenge. Ashamed to borrow strength from others, he swore to slaughter Hei Luan with his bare hands and sword.\n\nA commentary states: Black is the color of *yin*; egg is the form of *yin*.

      "translated_text": "Qiu represents land elevated at its center. Without Bingzhang, it is the image of old *yang*. Dan, discarding *yang*, becomes Laidan—thus the direction where young *yang* gradually grows. The *Yijing* states: \"When *yin* doubts *yang*, there must be strife.\" *Yang* ever dwells in the great summer, its task being to give life, nurture, and foster growth, while *yin* retreats and lies concealed. Yet toward *yang* it cannot but harbor enmity. Thus, when *yin* comes to power in the depths of winter, it imprisons creatures, seizing and slaying Qiu Bingzhang. Yet even as *yin* flourishes, a single spark of *yang* qi has already begun to germinate in the palace of Yellow Bell—hence Laidan’s resolve to avenge his father’s death. *Yang* is inherently firm, so Laidan’s *qi* is fiercely potent, his form starkly exposed. Still in its germinal stage, he counts grains to eat and moves with the wind. Though enraged, he cannot wield weapons to exact revenge. Yet because his nature is unyielding, he feels shame in borrowing strength from others and swears to slaughter Wei Hei Luan with his bare hands and sword.\n\nWei Hei Luan’s will is fierce beyond all others; his strength matches that of a hundred men. His sinews, bones, skin, and flesh are not of mortal kind. He stretches his neck to meet the blade, bares his chest to receive the arrow; edges bend and points shatter, yet his body bears no mark. Confident in his might, he regards Laidan as a fledgling chick.\n\nA commentary states: *Yin*’s task is to carve and restrain, and now is the season when it wields power amid unyielding ice. Thus his will is fierce, his strength peerless, his skin and bones inhuman; he meets blades and arrows without a scratch, and sees Laidan as but a fledgling chick.\n\nLaidan’s friend, Shen Tuo, said: \"Your hatred for Wei Hei Luan is extreme, and his underestimation of you is excessive. What plan will you devise?\" Laidan, tears falling, replied: \"I beg you to devise one for me.\" Shen Tuo said: \"I have heard that Kong Zhou of Wei, a descendant of his lineage, obtained the treasured swords of the Yin emperor. When a mere boy wore one, he repelled the masses of three armies. Why not seek them?\" Laidan then went to Wei, met Kong Zhou, and performed the rites of a servant-charioteer. He first offered his wife and children as hostages, then spoke of his desire.\n\nA commentary states: The treasured sword is a divine instrument capable of governing and restraining. Yin means \"center,\" akin to the *yin* of mid-spring. The treasured swords of the Yin emperor embody the harmonious *qi* that governs *yin* and *yang*, discerning and unerring. That his ancestor obtained them shows their Dao has endured since antiquity. The divine instrument is supremely subtle, with utmost softness driving the utmost hardness throughout the world. Thus a mere boy wearing one could repel the masses of three armies. Shen Tuo is one who can extend justice to those wronged, hence he devised this plan for Laidan. Kong Zhou is one who can navigate the utmost principles of human affairs, so Shen Tuo sent Laidan to seek the swords from such a man. Performing the rites of a servant-charioteer expresses utmost reverence. Offering his wife and children first pledges his sincerity.\n\nKong Zhou said: \"I possess three swords; choose whichever you wish. None can kill a man, but first let me describe their forms. The first is called *Han Guang* (Containing Light): when you look, it cannot be seen; when you wield it, its presence is unknown. Where it touches, all boundaries dissolve; it passes through things, yet things remain unaware. The second is called *Cheng Ying* (Bearing Shadow): at the juncture of dawn’s first light and the break of day, or at dusk’s twilight and the onset of night, if you face north and observe closely, faintly, as if something exists, yet its form cannot be discerned. Where it touches, there is a faint sound; it passes through things, yet things are not harmed. The third is called *Xiao Lian* (Night Forged): in broad daylight, you see its shadow but not its light; at night, you see its light but not its form. When it strikes an object, it passes with a sound like *huo* (a sharp crack), then seals instantly. You sense its swiftness, yet it draws no blood. These three treasures have been passed down for thirteen generations, yet never put to use. They remain sealed in their cases, never once opened.\"\n\nA commentary states: *Han Guang* preserves its light without shining—this describes the divine’s subtlety in all things. It cannot be seen because it has no form; its presence is unknown when wielded because it has no use. Where it touches, boundaries dissolve; it passes through things, yet things remain unaware—this is the Dao’s hidden constancy. *Cheng Ying* already has a shadow to bear. At the juncture of dawn’s first light and the break of day, or at dusk’s twilight and the onset of night—these are the times when *yin* and *yang* intersect. Seeking it by returning to the root, faintly, as if something exists, yet ultimately it cannot be discerned. Where it touches, there is a faint sound; it passes through things, yet things are not harmed—this is stirring the myriad things without opposition. *Xiao Lian* already has a form. In broad daylight, you see its shadow, for it is employed by *yang*. At night, you see its light, for it is governed by *yin*. Yet you see its shadow but not its light, its light but not its shadow—it does not yet appear as a distinct entity. When it strikes an object, it passes with a sharp sound, then seals instantly. You sense its swiftness, yet it draws no blood—it moves through the myriad things, giving life and nurturing, alternating flourishing and decline, its transformations endless. It compels those that live and transform to live and transform without cease, which may be called the swiftness of things. Yet the divine’s workings enter the formless through the seamless—this is the instant sealing after passing. Though swift, it does not harm things, nor can things harm it—this is drawing no blood. Passed down for thirteen generations, this speaks of traversing the cycles of *yin* and *yang*, enduring since antiquity. Never put to use, this is called the uselessness of the divine. Sealed in their cases, their concealment is profound. Never once opened, this is the absence of flaws in the divine.\n\nLaidan said: \"Even so, I must request the lowest of them.\" Kong Zhou then returned his wife and children and, after seven days of purification, at the time between dusk and darkness, knelt and presented the lowest sword.

      "translated_text": "A commentary states: Beneath the window lies the boundary of yin and yang. Drunk and sprawled, one is in a time of confusion and unawareness. When yin is at its zenith, only at the moment of their intersection and unawareness can it be truly harmed. Nevertheless, the sword of night-forged steel can only cause things to feel illness without drawing blood. Thus, when Laidan struck Black Egg with it, Black Egg raged at his wife, saying, \"You exposed me while drunk, leaving my throat sore and my waist stiff.\" When he struck Black Egg’s son, the son said, \"Earlier, you met me at the gate and beckoned me thrice—it also left my body aching and my limbs rigid.\" Laidan, realizing the sword could not kill, sighed and returned home. Yet though Black Egg remained unaware even as the blade struck, he still suffered a sore throat and stiff waist, his body gradually wasting away from that day. Thus, though there was a day of biting cold and a day of piercing frost, soon the spring sun rose warm, and the small departed while the great arrived. People are blind to the fact that the fourth month belongs to summer, unaware that its origin lay in Laidan’s subtle shift on that first day.\n\nI have traced the Dao of yin and yang: their mutual generation is like father and son, their pairing like husband and wife. In their alternating use, they are ever born and ever die; in their struggle, they are ever enraged and ever hostile. When imprisoned, they become illness; when in power, they flourish. Though their Dao requires nothing external, its function resides in things—such is the nature of yin and yang. All things’ natures and human actions are but servants of yin and yang. If one examines human emotions and the changes of things, the nature of yin and yang is found to encompass all principles without exception. Thus, there are cases like Wei Black Egg, who killed Qiu Bingzhang out of private enmity, and Laidan, who vowed to slaughter Black Egg with his own sword. Yet the principle of yin and yang is such that as one waxes, the other wanes, and they can never be entirely severed. Thus, though Laidan harbored the intent to kill Black Egg, he could not slay him. Had Black Egg been killable, the principle of generation and transformation would have nearly ceased. If so, how could Wei Black Egg have killed Qiu Bingzhang? For Qiu Bingzhang had already been used and overcome by the flourishing force, and thus could be killed. But Wei Black Egg was then in power and flourishing—how could he be killed? Moreover, at that time, not only was the yang qi subtly stirring in Laidan, but Wei Black Egg already had his wife and son. Thus, though the Dao of yin and yang holds that yang is born at *zi* and yin at *wu*, within yin there is yang, and within yang there is yin—their arising, growth, decline, and cessation are beyond all reckoning.\n\nHe who understands these words of *Liezi* has grasped more than half of the Dao.\n\nKing Mu of Zhou launched a great campaign against the Western Rong, who presented him with the *kunwu* sword and fire-washed cloth. The sword measured a foot and a span, its red-hot steel blade cutting jade as easily as mud. The fire-washed cloth, when washed, must be cast into fire: the cloth turns the color of flame, while the grime turns the color of cloth. Removed from the fire and shaken, it gleams as white as snow. The prince believed no such things existed and dismissed their accounts as false. Xiao Shu said: \"Does the prince cling so stubbornly to his own certainty, so stubbornly to his denial of principle?\"\n\nA commentary states: The *kunwu* sword and fire-washed cloth were gifts from the Western Rong, not possessions of the Central States. The prince, confined by what he had seen and heard, could not broadly comprehend the transformations and anomalies of things’ principles. To immediately dismiss such things as nonexistent and their accounts as false—is this not a denial of principle?\n\nThis chapter of *Liezi* wondrously extends beyond the bounds of heaven and earth. Whether the divine smelting of Nüwa’s stones, the Foolish Old Man’s moving of mountains, Kuafu’s pursuit of the sun, Bian Que’s healing of illness, Yanshi’s creation of the singing automaton, or Laidan’s wielding of the sword—nearly all expound the profoundest words of the boundless, clearing the obstructions of the mind, and reveal the wondrous principles of the infinite, opening what the eyes and ears cannot perceive. If even those of shallow knowledge and limited experience remain confined by what they see and hear, unable to deeply seek the ultimate principle, how can they ever free themselves from their shackles? Such is the intent behind concluding the chapter thus.\n\n**Tang’s Inquiry: A Commentary**\nAll things emerge from and return to the mechanism, each following its inherent nature and inclinations, endlessly transforming into myriad forms and shapes. There are things even Yu the Great could not see, Bo Yi could not hear, and Yi Jian could not record. Who can exhaust their changes? Yet though their forms differ, their natures are the same. The people of Longbo’s land may be vast, but their minds and wisdom differ not from those of the tiny Jiao Yao. The Jiao Yao may be small in stature, but their likes and dislikes differ not from those of the Longbo. The midge is minute, yet its life is not lacking; the roc is immense, yet its nature is not excessive. The great *chun* tree may live long, yet it too dies; the ephemeral mushroom may perish young, yet it too has lived. The ignorant are bewildered by the unevenness of things’ transformations, unaware that their natures remain unchanging. Thus, they boast of longevity and lament early death, cling to love and shun aversion, entangled and confused, toiling endlessly without cease.\n\nTherefore, *Liezi* employs *Tang’s Inquiry* to distinguish the great and small, same and different, vast and minute, long and short. In essence, if one seeks this chapter through the ultimate Dao, there are things like the sun’s distance, which a child can discern yet Confucius could not decide; things like Bian Que’s healing of illness, where Gong Yu and Qi Ying and their two households could not understand one another—all are deluded by changes in form, unaware that their fundamental nature is no different. If one knows what is shared, then everywhere is unity. Thus, Pujuzi’s archery can be used for angling, and the principles of archery and angling can be used to govern the state. Zheng Shiwen and Bo Ya achieved mastery of the zither through this, while Ziqi excelled in listening. Fei Wei and Ji Chang became renowned archers through this, and Zaofu attained precision in charioteering.",

      "translated_text": "Effort addressed Fate, saying: \"What are your achievements compared to mine?\"\nFate replied: \"What merit have you rendered to things that you would compare yourself to me?\"\nEffort said: \"Longevity or early death, success or failure, nobility or baseness, wealth or poverty—these are all within my power.\"\nFate said: \"The wisdom of Peng Zu did not surpass that of Yao and Shun, yet he lived eight hundred years. The talent of Yan Yuan did not fall below that of ordinary men, yet he died at thirty-two. The virtue of Confucius did not rank below that of feudal lords, yet he was besieged in Chen and Cai. The conduct of King Zhou of Yin did not surpass that of the Three Benevolent Ones, yet he occupied the throne. Ji Zha held no rank in Wu, while Tian Heng usurped the state of Qi. Boyi and Shuqi starved on Mount Shouyang, while the Ji clan grew richer than Zhan Qin. If these were within your power, why do the long-lived die young, the sagely suffer hardship while the perverse prosper, the worthy live in lowliness while the foolish enjoy honor, and the good remain poor while the wicked grow rich?\"\n\nEffort said: \"If it is as you say, then I have indeed no merit in things, yet why do things turn out thus? Is this not what you control?\"\nFate replied: \"Since it is called Fate, how can there be one who controls it? I merely follow the straight and yield to the crooked. Things live long or die young, succeed or fail, rise or fall, grow rich or poor—how can I comprehend them? How can I comprehend them?\"\n\n*Explication*:\nEffort is what man does; Fate is what Heaven ordains. Heaven does not depend on man, nor does man complete without Heaven. That effort is constrained by Fate, and Fate arises from effort, cannot easily be distinguished in terms of merit. Comparing the weightiest of efforts with the most tenuous of Fates, how can one say effort’s merit is greater? Comparing the most abundant of Fates with the most meager of virtues, how can one say Fate’s merit is not profound?\n\nThose who emphasize effort, though Fate governs, believe it arises from inherent nature and do not call it Fate. Those who emphasize Fate, though nature governs, believe it arises from Fate and do not call it nature. Both are one-sided views. Examining one aspect alone—Peng’s longevity and Yan’s early death—one might suspect they were determined by Fate. Yet not all like Peng live long, nor do all of Yan’s talent necessarily die young; perhaps this arises from effort. Thus, to say effort has merit in things yet plays no part in Fate is untenable; to say all things are governed by Fate with no role for effort is equally untenable.\n\nNevertheless, what arrives without being summoned, what occurs without knowing why—this is Fate. Since it is called Fate, it governs the ten thousand things without heeding them. If there were one who controlled it, how could it be called Fate? Thus, it follows the straight without exhaustion through all ages; it yields to the crooked, completing the ten thousand things without omission. Though one speaks of following, there is none who follows; though one speaks of yielding, there is none who yields. The straight is straight of itself; the crooked is crooked of itself. Longevity or early death, success or failure, nobility or baseness, wealth or poverty—these arise neither from Heaven nor from man. Like the raven’s blackness, the swan’s whiteness, the *chun* tree’s longevity, the mushroom’s brevity—all are self-determined. Who is the agent? Only that things act of themselves, with none acting upon them. Thus, these eight conditions in man are like plants whose roots determine their sprouts. Fine fruit follows blossoms; the finest grain’s fruit comes from its excellent seed. Though there be foul shoots, their growth must follow their roots. Tracing to their source, not even a hair’s deviation is found. How can one know that today’s abundance of Fate does not arise from past abundance of virtue? Or that today’s abundance of virtue does not accumulate for a future abundance of Fate? These are all unknowable.\n\nIf so, then Fate is not necessarily distinct from effort, nor effort from Fate. How then can one assert the existence of Fate? How can one deny it? Even Fate does not know why it is so. This is what makes it Fate. How can one hastily take the crude calculations of alleyway rustics, demanding recompense from the Creator, insisting that the worthy live long and the wicked die young, the wise be honored and the foolish debased, the good grow rich and the evil remain poor? Their failure to comprehend Fate is extreme.\n\nOnly those who truly know Fate follow Heaven’s natural principle, cultivate human effort without neglect, forget both longevity and early death, delight in both success and failure, adapt to both honor and wealth, and remain unchanged by poverty or riches. This is what the sage calls \"rejoicing in Heaven and knowing Fate,\" and the reason *Liezi* composed the chapter \"Effort and Fate.\" In *Zhuangzi*, the *Great Master* concludes with Zisang’s discourse on Fate, deeming this the ultimate teaching of the *Great Master*.

      "translated_text": "All his life, he remained at ease, unaware of honor or disgrace as belonging to others or to himself.\n\nMaster Dongguo heard of this and said: \"Beigongzi has slept long indeed—yet a single word could awaken him. How easily his sorrow was dispelled!\"\n\nExplanation:\nThe movement of the Heavenly Dao proceeds from west to north. You (酉) is the gate through which the myriad things close, hence the name Ximenzi. The north is where the myriad things are stored and where the essence of transformation is most profound, hence the name Beigongzi. Ximenzi, facing inward toward his dwelling, is thus rich in Fate but poor in virtue. Beigongzi, however, conceals himself deeply, and so is rich in virtue but poor in Fate.\n\nMaster Dongguo has labored through the trigram Kan and emerged into Zhen—he does not abide in non-action but moves into stillness through activity. Thus, he could dispel Beigongzi’s shame and awaken him.\n\nI have examined Fate: it arises from no governing agency yet arrives inevitably, something no living being can escape. Even the sages Yao, Shun, Yi, and Qi, or Confucius; the worthies Jizha, Zhan Qin, and Yanzi—all were bound by Fate and could not alter it throughout their lives. No wonder Beigongzi felt shame for his virtue, and Ximenzi boasted of his favorable Fate.\n\nYet if we say Fate arrives from no agency, then its coming is natural, with no one to bring it. If the bringer is fundamentally nonexistent, then who receives its constraints? Whether constrained or not depends on oneself alone. Thus, if one does not accept Fate, one is constrained by it; if one understands Fate, one constrains it rather than being constrained by it.\n\nFrom this, sages may be impoverished and the benevolent may die young; the good may be poor and the worthy may be lowly. Yet we have never heard of Fate altering the conduct of sages and worthies. Therefore, when Beigongzi heard Master Dongguo’s words and recognized the principle of what is inherently so, he remained at ease all his life, unaware of honor or disgrace as belonging to others or to himself.\n\nIf this is so, can Fate truly constrain him? This is the achievement of one who has attained the Way of Fate.",

He ate his coarse beans and tasted the savor of fine grain and meat. He sheltered in his thatched hut as if beneath the shade of a grand hall.

      "translated_text": "Guan Yiwu and Bao Shuya shared a bond of profound friendship, dwelling together in Qi. Guan Yiwu served Prince Jiu, while Bao Shuya served Prince Xiaobai. The Qi ruling house was rife with favored clans, and the lines of legitimate and illegitimate succession ran parallel. The people of the state feared chaos. Guan Zhong and Shao Hu escorted Prince Jiu in flight to Lu, while Bao Shuya escorted Prince Xiaobai to Ju. Soon after, Gongsun Wuzhi staged a rebellion, leaving Qi without a ruler, and the two princes vied to return. Guan Yiwu clashed with Xiaobai on the road to Ju, loosing an arrow that struck Xiaobai’s belt hook. Once Xiaobai ascended the throne, he coerced Lu into executing Prince Jiu; Shao Hu died for him, while Guan Yiwu was imprisoned. Bao Shuya said to Duke Huan: “Guan Yiwu is capable—he can govern the state.” Duke Huan replied: “He is my enemy. I wish to kill him.” Bao Shuya said: “I have heard that a worthy lord harbors no private grudges. Moreover, one who can serve his own master can surely serve a lord. If you seek hegemony over kings, none but Yiwu will suffice. You must pardon him.” Thereupon, Guan Zhong was summoned. Lu returned him to Qi, and Bao Shuya welcomed him beyond the city gates, releasing him from captivity. Duke Huan treated him with reverence, placing him above the ministers Gao and Guo. Bao Shuya humbled himself before him, entrusting him with state affairs, and he was styled “Uncle Zhong.” Duke Huan thus became a hegemon.\n\nGuan Zhong once sighed: “In my youth, when I was poor and distressed, I once traded goods with Bao Shu, taking more than my share of the profits. Bao Shu did not deem me greedy, knowing I was impoverished. I once devised a plan for Bao Shu that ended in utter failure, yet he did not think me foolish, knowing that circumstances may be favorable or unfavorable. I was employed three times and thrice dismissed by my lords, yet Bao Shu did not consider me worthless, knowing I had not met with the right moment. I fought in three battles and fled all three, yet Bao Shu did not think me cowardly, knowing I had an aged mother. When Prince Jiu was defeated, Shao Hu died for him, while I endured imprisonment and humiliation. Bao Shu did not think me shameless, knowing I did not scorn minor setbacks but felt shame if my name were not renowned throughout the world. My parents gave me life, but Bao Shu truly knew me.” Thus the world praises the fine friendship of Guan and Bao, and Xiaobai’s skill in employing the capable. Yet in truth, there was no fine friendship, nor any skill in employing the capable.\n\nIn truth, there was no fine friendship, nor any skill in employing the capable—not because there existed some other fine friendship or some other skill in employing the capable. Shao Hu did not choose to die; he had no choice but to die. Bao Shuya did not choose to recommend the worthy; he had no choice but to recommend them. Xiaobai did not choose to employ his enemy; he had no choice but to employ him.\n\nExplanation: In the affairs of the world, whatever succeeds beyond the reach of human foresight, whatever arrives without being summoned—this is Fate. When Guan Yiwu and Bao Shuya first shared their profound bond, their hearts could be said to have known no distance. Later, when Yiwu served Prince Jiu and Bao Shu served Prince Xiaobai, though their lords differed, their hearts remained unchanged. When the two princes contended for entry and clashed on the road to Ju, and Guan Zhong’s arrow struck Duke Huan, at that moment, how could Yiwu have harbored any intention of serving Duke Huan? After Duke Huan ascended the throne and coerced Lu into killing Prince Jiu, he even petitioned Lu to surrender Guan Zhong as his enemy, wishing to vent his hatred by mincing him—how then could Duke Huan have harbored any intention of employing Uncle Zhong? Even if Bao Shuya could forget the enmity of the Ju road and not abandon their former friendship, he should still have refrained from recommending Guan Zhong’s worth, given Duke Huan’s hatred. Moreover, Guan Zhong, in serving Prince Jiu, had failed to achieve success beforehand and failed to die for him afterward—his worthiness was hardly exemplary. Yet now, Bao Shuya disregarded Qi’s suspicions and recommended him; Duke Huan forgot his lack of service to Prince Jiu and, setting aside his enmity, employed him; Guan Zhong, too, did not feel shame for his past imprisonment and humiliation, nor did he decline his position, but devoted himself to Qi, forgetting his former service to Prince Jiu. None of this could have been foreseen by human foresight.\n\nOnce Guan Zhong was employed by Qi, he filled the granaries, clarified rites and norms, enriched the state, and strengthened its armies. He turned misfortune into fortune and defeat into victory, ultimately uniting the feudal lords nine times and rectifying the world. The people have reaped his benefits to this day. Thus Confucius praised him, saying: “Were it not for Guan Zhong, we would still be wearing our hair loose and fastening our robes on the left.” Was Guan Zhong’s contribution to later generations and the world at large a trifling one? Indeed, Guan Zhong did not cling to the petty fidelity of common men and women, nor did he drown himself in a ditch. Had Bao Shuya’s words gone unheeded and Duke Huan’s enmity remained unresolved, how could Bao Shuya have preserved their friendship? Where could Guan Zhong have applied his talents?\n\nNevertheless, Guan Zhong ultimately achieved the great feat of uniting the feudal lords and rectifying the world, so that the people have reaped his benefits to this day. Thus Bao Shuya’s recommendation of his enemy, Duke Huan’s employment of his enemy, and Guan Zhong’s enduring humiliation in Lu to devote himself to Qi—all these were matters of necessity, not choice. From this perspective, when the world praises the fine friendship of Guan and Bao and Xiaobai’s skill in employing the capable, it is not that there was any fine friendship or any skill in employing the capable. All was the work of Fate, not something within human power. If one claims there was fine friendship, then what was the state of Guan Zhong’s friendship during the battle on the road to Ju? If one claims there was skill in employing the capable, why did Duke Huan’s employment of Guan Zhong depend on Bao Shuya’s words? The point is not that only Duke Huan and Guan and Bao were thus. In all cases, the trust between friends and the duty between lord and minister are no different. Yet upon close examination, the conduct of these several men was all marked by impartiality of heart. With hearts fixed on perfect impartiality, friendship need not be preserved to be preserved, enmity need not be abandoned to be abandoned, and loyalty need not be demonstrated to be demonstrated.",

      "translated_text": "This was the foundation upon which Duke Huan established his hegemony.\n\nAlas! If one can but make one’s heart impartial, then in all things it will naturally accord with the spontaneous workings of Heaven’s mandate. Why, then, should one debase oneself and bend the Way in petty pursuit of conformity to the whims of others?\n\nMoreover, even the governance of a hegemon—achieved through cunning strategy and force—was not something within human power to accomplish. Extending this principle upward, we see that the Way of the August Sovereigns, the virtue of the Divine Emperors, and the radiant governance of the True Kings were all spontaneous and self-arising, not made by human effort. This much is evident.\n\nWhen Guan Yiwu fell ill, Duke Xiao Bai visited him and said, “Your illness, Uncle Zhong, has grown grave. There is no need to avoid speaking of it. If it should become critical, to whom shall I entrust the state?”\n\nGuan Yiwu asked, “Whom does my lord desire?”\n\nDuke Xiao Bai replied, “Bao Shuya would be suitable.”\n\nGuan Yiwu said, “He is not. He is a man of integrity and purity, a fine gentleman. Yet toward those who do not measure up to him, he does not associate with them. Once he hears of another’s fault, he never forgets it. If you place him in charge of the state, above he will probe the ruler, and below he will oppose the people. His offense against you, my lord, will not be long in coming.”\n\n*Explanation:* People often cite Guan Zhong’s refusal to entrust the state to Bao Shuya as evidence of his judgment. In truth, Guan Zhong knew Bao Shuya’s talents were not suited to governing the state, for he feared Bao Shuya would offend the ruler. Is it not better to spare him the burden of governance and allow him to remain whole, rather than to place him in office only to incur guilt? This was Guan Zhong’s way of preserving their friendship.\n\nDuke Xiao Bai asked, “Then who would be suitable?”\n\nGuan Yiwu replied, “If you must choose, then Xi Peng will do. His character is such that above he forgets his lord, and below the people do not rebel. He feels shame for not equaling the Yellow Emperor and pities those who do not equal himself. One who distributes virtue to others is called a sage; one who distributes wealth to others is called a worthy. To rule others with one’s worthiness is never to win their allegiance; to humble oneself before the worthy is never to fail in winning their allegiance. In governing the state, he does not pry; in managing his household, he does not spy. If you must choose, then Xi Peng will do.”\n\nThus, Guan Yiwu did not slight Bao Shuya out of preference, nor did he favor Xi Peng by choice. To favor one at the outset may lead to slighting him in the end; to slight one in the end may follow from favoring him at the start. The ebb and flow of favor and disfavor do not depend on me.\n\n*Explanation:* “Above he forgets his lord” refers to his governance being unobtrusive. “Below the people do not rebel” refers to his people being simple and sincere. Feeling shame for not equaling the Yellow Emperor means he does not presume upon his own superiority. Pitying those who do not equal himself means his heart is set on rescuing others with goodness. To distribute virtue to others is to enable the people to return to their true nature and restore their original condition—this is the Way of the sage. To distribute wealth to others is to ensure the people lack nothing in providing for their parents above and nurturing their children below—this is the virtue of the worthy. To rule others with one’s worthiness is like a mountain’s barren slopes; to humble oneself before the worthy is like a marsh’s fertile growth.\n\nAs for “in governing the state, he does not pry; in managing his household, he does not spy,” this does not mean he truly fails to see or hear. Rather, his Way is sufficient to embrace all things. Herein lies the reason Xi Peng was suitable and Bao Shuya was not.\n\nAn ancient saying goes: “Without blindness and deafness, one cannot achieve great success.” This is precisely the point.\n\nIn the *Classic of Poetry*, the preface to the *Gejü* speaks of the Wei ruler’s treacherous miserliness and narrow impatience, while the poem itself says: “It is this narrow heart that is the target of reproach.” The harm of a narrow heart to governance is thus made clear.\n\nWhen one walks the path with others, the ebb and flow of favor and disfavor follow the principle of perfect impartiality and the natural order of things, not one’s own will. Only Guan, Bao, and Xi understood this. Thus, the waxing and waning of their relationships adhered to Heaven’s principle and did not follow personal inclination. Was this not the reason the governance of Qi could honor the Zhou and strengthen the state?\n\n*Explication of the Perfect Dao of Primal Virtue*, Scroll Twelve—Concluded\n*Explication of the Perfect Dao of Primal Virtue*, Scroll Thirteen",

During Zichan’s governance of Zheng, he composed the *Bamboo Penal Code*. The state of Zheng adopted it, yet Deng Xi repeatedly challenged Zichan’s administration. Zichan yielded to him. Zichan then seized and executed him, swiftly putting him to death.\n\nThus, Zichan did not *choose* to employ the *Bamboo Penal Code*—he had no choice but to use it. Deng Xi did not *choose* to humble Zichan—he had no choice but to yield. Zichan did not *choose* to execute Deng Xi—he had no choice but to kill him.\n\n*Explication*:\nZichan served as Zheng’s minister for three years, and the virtuous submitted while the wicked were transformed—his governance should have been unassailable. Yet Deng Xi repeatedly challenged and humbled him. Zheng adopted Deng Xi’s *Bamboo Penal Code*, yet though they should have cherished its author, they ultimately executed him. Such are the workings of principle beyond human reckoning.\n\nThe world claims that Zichan’s execution of Deng Xi for composing the *Bamboo Penal Code* was an act of personal agency, failing to recognize that there were, in truth, forces at play compelling him to use the code, to yield, and to kill. Emperor Wen of Han, moved by Lady Tiying’s plea, abolished corporal punishment—yet none in later generations could restore it. The same principle applies.\n\nAccording to *Xunzi* and the *Zuozhuan*, Si Zhuan’s execution of Deng Xi occurred *after* Zichan’s death, leading scholars to suspect an error in the classics. Yet the *Liezi* concerns itself solely with illuminating the Dao and elucidating principle—what it grasps is the essence, while the incidental is left aside. Why quibble over minor discrepancies in its words?\n\nTo live when life is possible is Heaven’s blessing.\nTo die when death is due is Heaven’s blessing.",

      "translated_text": "And he was about to eat.\n\nMaster Lü said, \"Your illness arises neither from Heaven, nor from man, nor from ghosts. When you received life and took form, there was already one who ordained it, and one who knew it. What can medicine and stone do for you?\"\n\nSeason Liang said, \"A divine physician.\" He then sent him away with great respect.\n\nSoon after, Season Liang’s illness resolved of itself.\n\nExplanation: The meaning of *jiǎo* is to grasp what is crooked and straighten it, which is not natural. Master Jiao’s medicine sought to attack the illness after it had already arisen in life—this is the way of common physicians. Master Yu spoke of compliance, so his medicine lay in the beginning of life, deeming the illness incurable—this is the way of skilled physicians. Master Lü spoke of synthesis, so his medicine equated life and death as one. His words emerged from before the receiving of life and form, entering the spirit with profound meaning—this is the way of divine physicians.\n\nThus did Season Liang accept life and death with such equanimity. Was it not for this that Yang Zhu, upon seeing his gate after his death, sang?\n\nLife is not preserved by valuing it, nor is the body enriched by cherishing it. Life is not cut short by despising it, nor is the body diminished by slighting it. Thus, valuing it may not preserve life, despising it may not bring death, cherishing it may not enrich the body, and slighting it may not diminish it. This seems contradictory, yet it is not. Life and death, enrichment and diminution, arise of themselves. Or valuing it may preserve life, despising it may bring death, cherishing it may enrich the body, and slighting it may diminish it. This seems compliant, yet it is not. Life and death, enrichment and diminution, still arise of themselves.\n\nExplanation: Life and death, enrichment and diminution, are already ordained before the receiving of life and form. How can valuing or despising, cherishing or slighting, add or subtract to them after life has begun? The body is the entrusted form of Heaven and Earth, and life is the entrusted compliance of Heaven and Earth. Since Heaven and Earth have already entrusted transformation to us, they cannot violate the natural boundaries of our allotment—how much less can these things, which are not yours to possess, be preserved or destroyed by valuing or despising, enriched or diminished by cherishing or slighting?\n\nNevertheless, valuing and despising, preservation and destruction, cherishing and slighting arise from perception. False distinctions of sameness and difference: the many perceive sameness, the solitary perceive difference. Taking sameness as compliance and difference as opposition—if one follows the inherent nature, where lie opposition or compliance? To call them opposition or compliance is but semblance, not reality. In their essence, all things are as they are.\n\nThus, tracing the origin of life and form, though life knows not the body, and the body knows not life, how much less can they know valuing or despising, cherishing or slighting? Nevertheless, Liezi discusses this to clarify that the subtleties of life and form all arise from the natural, intending to dispel the world’s delusions—those who cling to life in pursuit of principle, or who enslave their forms to profit.\n\nAs for those who honor life and revere the root, desiring to be entrusted with the world, they would rather tread the path of seeming compliance than act with carelessness.\n\nZhai Xiong said to King Wen: \"What is long cannot be lengthened, what is short cannot be shortened. What is lost in calculation—what is it?\"\n\nLaozi said to Guan Yin: \"Who knows the reason for what Heaven detests? To anticipate Heaven’s will, to weigh profit and harm, is not as good as ceasing.\"\n\nExplanation: That length and shortness cannot be altered is like the legs of ducks and cranes, which cannot be cut or extended. Before life and form existed, there was already one who ordained it. Calculation is like wisdom—what can wisdom do? All is Heaven alone.\n\nThus, what man detests is what Heaven detests. Does Heaven privately detest man? The reason must have its origin, but it is not limited to what the ears and eyes perceive, nor can it be known in an instant. To receive it compliantly is acceptable.\n\nBut to use wisdom as a chisel, to weigh and sharpen it, exhausting the spirit with reckless conjecture—*The Classic of Virtue* calls this \"foreknowledge,\" the flower of the Dao and the beginning of folly. Thus, he told Guan Yin that anticipating Heaven’s will and weighing profit and harm is not as good as ceasing.\n\nTo conjecture and often hit the mark—this is why Confucius detested Zigong.\n\nYang Bu asked: \"Here is a man whose age, words, talents, and appearance are like his brother’s. Yet their lifespans are like father and son, their status like father and son, their reputations like father and son, their affections and aversions like father and son. I am perplexed.\"\n\nYangzi said: \"The ancients had a saying, which I once understood and will tell you: What is so without knowing why it is so—that is fate. Now, in darkness and obscurity, in confusion and chaos, whether acting or not acting, days pass and come—who can know the reason? All is fate.\"\n\nExplanation: What lies within us is nature; what lies with Heaven is fate. Nature may be cultivated but not neglected; fate may be heeded but not interfered with. The noble person conducts himself with proper conduct and awaits fate—why would he desire to subtly seek this fortune through such means?\n\nYet Yang Zhu, in his petty calculations, measured the thickness and thinness of years, virtue, talent, and appearance, and reckoned the differences in lifespan, status, reputation, affection, and aversion, likening father and son to brothers. Brothers are spoken of in terms of following one another in age, while father and son are spoken of in terms of the inequality of honor and humility. This is called adding delusion to delusion—great delusion! He did not understand that fate is at work.\n\nIn darkness and obscurity, beyond the reach of wisdom’s illumination; in confusion and chaos, beyond the power of reason to discern—whether acting or not acting, one does not hide in nothingness nor stagnate in being. Days pass, moving with transformation; days come, appearing with the times. Who can know the reason? This is how creation subtly works all things.\n\nIf creation were to calculate what a person should do in life and respond accordingly, its way of generating all things would be shallow indeed.",

      "translated_text": "One who trusts in fate knows neither long life nor early death; one who trusts in principle knows neither right nor wrong; one who trusts in the heart knows neither adversity nor compliance; one who trusts in nature knows neither safety nor peril. This is called having nothing to trust and nothing not to trust. Truly sincere and earnest—what should one reject, what should one embrace? What should one grieve, what should one rejoice? What should one do, what should one not do?\n\nExplanation: When we speak of knowing neither long life nor early death, right nor wrong, adversity nor compliance, safety nor peril, it is not that these do not exist. Consider how Yan Hui lived briefly while Robber Zhi lived long—even if a man of the Dao could truly trust in fate, how could he grossly misjudge others, calling Yanzi long-lived and Pengzu short-lived? He would simply allow life and death to follow their natural course without claiming them as his own. Only by not claiming them do both long life and early death proceed unimpeded—this is what it means to say they are \"not known.\" The same applies to right and wrong, adversity and compliance, safety and peril.\n\nTo say there is nothing to trust refers to knowing neither long life nor early death, neither right nor wrong, neither adversity nor compliance, neither safety nor peril. To say there is nothing not to trust refers to trusting in fate, principle, the heart, and nature. In this state, likes and dislikes do not arise, so there is nothing to avoid or pursue. Sorrow and joy do not manifest, so there is no grief or delight. Following what is not done, there is nothing done; following what is done, there is nothing not done. This may be called true and earnest. \"True\" means pure and without falsity; \"earnest\" means real and without delusion.\n\nThe book of the Yellow Emperor states: The perfected person dwells as though dead, moves as though mechanical. He does not know why he dwells, nor why he does not dwell; he does not know why he moves, nor why he does not move. He does not know why others observe changes in his countenance, nor does he say that others’ lack of observation leaves his countenance unchanged. Alone he comes, alone he goes, alone he enters, alone he departs—who can obstruct him?\n\nExplanation: To dwell as though dead means the heart is like dead ashes—it rests of itself, without intention. To move as though mechanical means to act like a crossbow’s trigger—it responds to things before moving. Moving or resting with the times, dwelling or not dwelling, acting or not acting—all follow their natural course, and none are known. In this state, self and things are both forgotten, and seeing and hearing are both extinguished—what observation remains? Flesh and bone are wholly dissolved, and countenance is but a temporary vessel—what change could there be? Transcending all, solitary and unique, with no counterpart—alone he enters, alone he departs, alone he comes, alone he goes. Who could obstruct him?\n\nThe conduct of ordinary people differs entirely. Their distinction between inner and outer is unsettled, their boundary between honor and disgrace unclear. They take having a name as honor, having no name as disgrace. Whether their countenance changes or not depends on whether others observe them. Thus they fear authority, fear punishment, fear ghosts, fear others, their five viscera knotted with sorrow, their bodies shackled in restraint. All their lives they toil without respite, perishing with the transformations—is this not lamentable? Why not reflect: I am myself—what need have I of others? If one truly examines one’s own self, then others’ observation or lack of it is of no concern, and one’s countenance need not change. Thus the perfected person does not depart from the real, while ordinary people cannot perceive the solitary—is there any other reason? It lies solely in oneself.\n\n*Explication of the Perfect Virtue of Primordial Emptiness, Scroll Thirteen Concluded*\n*Explication of the Perfect Virtue of Primordial Emptiness, Scroll Fourteen*",

      "translated_text": "Submitted by Your Servant Jiang Yu, Inner Hall Student of the Hangzhou Prefecture Academy\n\n**On the Distribution of Power and Fate**\n\nMo Xi, Shan Zhi, Tan Xuan, and Bie Fu—these four roamed the world together, each fulfilling their aspirations. Though they spent their lives in one another’s company, they never truly knew one another’s hearts, for each believed their own wisdom to be profound.\n\nQiao Ning, Yu Zhi, Nü Zhuo, and Pian Pi—these four roamed the world together, each fulfilling their aspirations. Though they spent their lives in one another’s company, they never spoke of their arts, for each believed their own cunning to be subtle.\n\nYu Ya, Qing Lu, Jian Ji, and Ling Sui—these four roamed the world together, each fulfilling their aspirations. Though they spent their lives in one another’s company, they never awakened to one another’s insights, for each believed their own talent to be perfectly realized.\n\nMian Xuan, Zhui Wei, Yong Gan, and Qie Yi—these four roamed the world together, each fulfilling their aspirations. Though they spent their lives in one another’s company, they never exposed one another’s faults, for each believed their conduct to be without transgression.\n\nDuo Ou, Zi Zhuan, Cheng Quan, and Zhi Li—these four roamed the world together, each fulfilling their aspirations. Though they spent their lives in one another’s company, they never exchanged glances, for each believed the times to be perfectly suited to them.\n\nSuch are the manifold dispositions of the world. Though their appearances differ, all are ultimately gathered into the Dao—this is the decree to which they return.\n\n*Explication:*\nMo Xi and Shan Zhi represent the divergent temperaments of composure and trepidation. Tan Xuan and Bie Fu embody the contrasting demeanors of leisurely delay and hasty impulse. Qiao Ning and Yu Zhi differ as cunning flattery and blunt honesty. Nü Zhuo and Pian Pi vary as stubborn obstinacy and fawning compliance. Yu Ya and Qing Lu diverge in their excess and superficiality of emotion. Jian Ji and Ling Sui contrast in their reticence and eloquence. Mian Xuan and Zhui Wei differ in their preference for either clarity or complexity. Yong Gan and Qie Yi oppose bold resolve and timid hesitation. Duo Ou is one who echoes others; Zi Zhuan, one who trusts only himself. Cheng Quan exploits authority to dominate others; Zhi Li relies solely on his own strength without aid.\n\nEver since the Great Simplicity dissolved, the people have raced along the paths of right and wrong, profit and harm, their dispositions manifold and beyond enumeration. Liezi here summarizes twenty distinctions based on the inclinations to which their natures cling, the arts they transmit, the talents they employ, the conduct they display, and the times they encounter. Those of temperament believe their wisdom to be profound; those of art, their skill to be subtle; those of talent, their abilities to be perfectly realized; those of conduct, their actions to be without fault; those of timing, their circumstances to be perfectly suited. In their confusion, each affirms what they affirm and rejects what they reject, fulfilling their aspirations throughout their lives—so varied are the world’s dispositions.\n\nYet when one examines their origins, success and failure are equal in the realm of the living. Beauty and ugliness, goodness and foulness, all meet the same end. This is why they are moved by the Dao and converge in fate. Though all are gathered into the Dao, they do not comprehend it; though all return to fate, they do not trust it. Relying on private wisdom, clinging to partial views, they pursue only the interests of their small selves, forgetting the great impartiality of the world. In this, their resemblance to heaven and earth differs not from the mutual affinity of the one-legged Kui, the serpent, and the wind-eyed creature—what worth is there in being the most intelligent of the living?\n\nOnly those who embody the Dao and attain to fate achieve a mind congealed and a form released. When the mind congeals, there is no room within for cunning or affectation; when the form is released, there is no trace without of expression or countenance. These are the wellsprings of the world’s dispositions, yet those who transcend them wander carefree between heaven and earth, their hearts at ease. Looking down upon the world’s dispositions—is this not lamentable?\n\nThings that seem to succeed do so only by chance, not by true success. Things that seem to fail do so only by chance, not by true failure. Thus delusion arises from chance, and in the moment of chance, one is benighted. If, in the moment of chance, one is not benighted, then one is neither startled by external misfortune nor delighted by internal fortune. Moving with the times, halting with the times—even wisdom cannot fathom this.\n\n*Explication:*\nThe principles of the world are most subtle yet most luminous. Before signs appear, they are subtle; yet their principles are utterly clear. The worthy are blind to what has not yet sprouted; the common people are blind to what has already come to pass. If they are blind even to what has already occurred, how much more so to the incipient signs of success and failure? It is fitting that they remain benighted and know nothing of them.\n\nYet so-called chance success and chance failure are not truly chance at all—the principles of success and failure are silently determined before any form appears. Though it is said that delusion arises from chance, in truth, chance arises from delusion. Only those who cannot perceive the unformed signs of success and failure are bewildered in the moment of chance. Even in success, they dare not be certain of it, trembling lest it slip away; even in failure, they do not accept it as failure, hoping still for some gain. How, then, could they not be startled by external misfortune and delighted by internal fortune?\n\nIf one can remain unbewildered in the moment of chance, then success is simply success, and failure simply failure. Regarding fortune and misfortune as the alternation of day and night, the succession of cold and heat—seeing the outward, one knows the inward; observing the past, one knows the future. What room is there for joy or sorrow in between? Such a one has advanced beyond wisdom and aligned with the Dao. Even the great matters of life and death hold no change for them—how much less the mere beginnings of profit and harm?\n\nOne who trusts fate harbors no duality between self and other. Those who maintain such duality would do better to cover their eyes and plug their ears, turning their backs to cliffs and facing chasms—they would not fall. Thus it is said: life and death come from fate; poverty and hardship come from the times. Those who resent early death do not understand fate; those who resent poverty do not understand the times. Facing death without fear, enduring hardship without sorrow—these are those who understand fate and accept the times.\n\n*Explication:*\nWhen Shang Qiu Kai walked through water and fire, declaring that nothing could oppose him, his mind was unified—this illustrates how one who trusts fate harbors no duality between self and other.",

      "translated_text": "Without trust in fate, one clings to the self, and with the self established, \"other\" and \"this\" arise. With \"other\" and \"this\" in place, likes and dislikes take form; as likes and dislikes intertwine, sorrow and joy alternate—though one may never have turned their back to cliffs or faced chasms, the fear of falling remains ever-present. Those who cover their eyes and plug their ears do not truly forget what they see and hear; yet with perception momentarily obstructed, even if they truly turned their backs to cliffs and faced chasms, they would not fall. This is how those who understand fate and accept the times face death without fear and endure hardship without sorrow.\n\nWhen the clever weigh profit and harm, assess emptiness and fullness, and gauge human sentiments, their gains and losses may still align with fate. When the foolish do not weigh profit and harm, do not assess emptiness and fullness, and do not gauge human sentiments, their gains and losses may also align with fate. What difference, then, lies between weighing and not weighing, assessing and not assessing, gauging and not gauging? Only when there is nothing to weigh and nothing not to weigh does one remain whole and free from loss. It is not that one knows wholeness or loss—one simply remains whole, loses, or perishes of their own accord.\n\n*Explication:*\nWeighing success and failure in profit and harm, assessing presence and absence in emptiness and fullness, gauging likes and dislikes in human sentiments—these are the ways of the clever. The unwise do the opposite. Yet the clever do not always succeed, nor do the foolish always fail. Thus, weighing or not weighing, assessing or not assessing, gauging or not gauging—none differ in outcome. Still, one cannot abandon cleverness because it does not always succeed, nor cling to foolishness because it does not always fail. Only when there is nothing to weigh and nothing not to weigh, when one employs wisdom without being enslaved by it and relies on wisdom without depending on it, do gain and loss both vanish. One remains perpetually whole, yet neither knows nor cares why this is so.\n\nDuke Jing of Qi wandered on Ox Mountain, gazing northward over his capital. Tears streamed down his face as he sighed: \"How beautiful is this land! So lush and verdant—how could I bear to leave it and die?\" If the ancients had never died, where would I go after departing this realm? His attendants, Shi Kong and Liang Qiu Ju, wept alongside him, saying: \"We rely on Your Lordship’s grace. Though we eat coarse grains and tough meat, ride broken-down horses and rickety carriages, we still do not wish to die—how much less Your Lordship?\" Only Yanzi laughed beside them. The duke wiped his tears and turned to Yanzi: \"Today’s outing has left me sorrowful. Kong and Ju wept with me—why do you alone laugh?\" Yanzi replied: \"If worthy rulers had always guarded this land, then the Great Duke and Duke Huan would still rule it. If brave rulers had always guarded it, then Duke Zhuang and Duke Ling would still rule it. Had these lords remained, where would Your Lordship be but standing in the fields in straw raincoat and hat, tending to affairs and fretting over death? How would you have come to occupy this throne? Since rulers have succeeded and departed one after another, and you alone weep for it, this is unkind. Seeing an unkind ruler and flattering ministers—these are the two things that made me laugh in secret.\" Duke Jing grew ashamed. He raised his cup to punish himself and forced his two ministers to drink two cups each as well.\n\n*Explication:*\nThe penalty of wine replenishes what is lacking in one’s qi. Duke Jing, gazing over his capital, admired its beauty and longed to preserve it forever, yet had no means to do so—his sorrow and tears knew no end. Upon hearing Yanzi’s words, he realized his cultivation was insufficient. Thus, he raised his cup to punish himself and forced his two ministers to drink two cups each. The double cups served to emphasize his inadequacy.\n\nThere was a man of Wei named Dongmen Wu whose son died, yet he felt no grief. His steward asked: \"No one in the world loved their child more than you. Now that your son has died, why do you not grieve?\" Dongmen Wu replied: \"I once had no son, and when I had no son, I felt no grief. Now that my son has died, it is the same as when I had no son—why should I grieve?\"\n\n*Explication:*\nAll who possess human form have human emotions; only the people of the great antiquity could forget them, while those of later ages could not match this. If one has not attained the forgetting of emotions yet remains indifferent and untroubled, they fall short of true emotion. How can one without emotion still be called human? Even Confucius, who engaged with the world, wept bitterly at the death of Yan Hui, asking, \"For whom else would I grieve if not for him?\" His inability to forget emotion was thus. Yet Dongmen Wu felt no grief at his son’s death—was he truly one who had forgotten emotion?\n\nFarmers rush to the seasons, merchants chase profit, artisans pursue skill, and the benevolent seek power—circumstances compel them. Yet farmers face droughts and floods, merchants encounter gains and losses, artisans meet success and failure, and officials experience favor and neglect—fate compels them.\n\n*Explication:*\nThis is the chapter \"Force and Fate.\" Liezi exhaustively demonstrates that all living things are governed by fate, yet he also warns against dismissing effort as futile and sinking into inaction. His purpose is to ensure that force and fate proceed together without losing their mysterious operation.\n\n*Force and Fate Explained*\nMencius called benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom \"fate,\" for they are rooted in human nature—thus the noble person does not call them fate. He regarded sensory pleasures as \"nature,\" for they are subject to fate—thus the noble person does not call them nature. What pertains to nature can be cultivated through human effort; what pertains to fate cannot be altered by heaven’s principle. Though some aspects of nature may be influenced by habit, human effort cannot be abandoned. Though heaven’s decrees depend on human action, heaven’s mandate cannot be entrusted entirely to fate. What fate governs may reside in nature; what nature possesses may be governed by fate. Nature and fate always proceed together; heaven and humanity constantly interact. Human lifespan, prosperity, rank, wealth, and poverty—all arise from this. Thus, Liezi composed the chapter \"Force and Fate.\"",

      "translated_text": "Having examined the words of Liezi, one finds that while he places primacy on fate, he does not deny the efficacy of human effort in shaping things—yet neither does he wish to abandon all human endeavor and surrender entirely to fate. The essential point lies in not being burdened by matters of longevity or early death, nobility or lowliness, success or failure, wealth or poverty, for the power to shape fate resides within oneself.\n\nMoreover, when force is set against fate, it is simply the natural course of things. They depend upon one another and cannot exist without each other; viewed through the lens of the Dao, all is fate. Thus, what one desires to do is fate; what one does not do is also fate. What succeeds when pursued is fate; what fails when pursued is also fate. Whether one advances directly or yields to circumstance, matters of longevity or early death, success or failure, nobility or lowliness, wealth or poverty—all arise of themselves.\n\nSince these are said to arise of themselves, with no external force governing them, then even in matters of longevity or early death, who is there to augment or diminish? Even in matters of success or failure, what cause is there for joy or sorrow? Thus, one who understands fate accepts and receives these things as they come.\n\nConsider Confucius, whose sageliness was unmatched since the dawn of humankind—yet once bound by fate, he was twice exiled from Lu, had trees felled over him in Song, faced hardship in Shang and Zhou, and was besieged between Chen and Cai, ultimately serving not a single ruler. Though heaven had endowed him with near-sagely gifts, his teachings remained mere empty words, never realized in action—this may indeed be called fate. As for the Master, he cultivated himself, accepted success or failure as it came, recognized that comings and goings were not his to control, and stilled the turmoil of his heart and thoughts. His joy in heaven and understanding of fate were thus. Therefore, he found joy in adversity and joy in prosperity, yet what he rejoiced in was neither adversity nor prosperity.\n\nHowever, short of being a sage, none can truly comprehend the constraints of fate. Not only do they fail to understand, but they also persist in calculating what human effort has yet to achieve, rolling up their sleeves in defiance—how lamentable! Thus, Bao Shu initially treated Guan Zhong with generosity, yet Guan Zhong later slighted him; Xi Peng initially slighted Guan Zhong, yet Guan Zhong later treated him with generosity. Deng Xi opposed Zichan’s governance, yet Zichan adopted Deng Xi’s penal code; Zichan first employed his laws, and Deng Xi later met execution under them. Generosity arose from their own nature; slight arose from their own nature. The use of laws was unavoidable; the imposition of punishment was unavoidable. All was fate, not something within human power to control. Yet these men, in their time, claimed their actions as the work of their own wisdom and ability, failing to recognize the inherent principle of things. This is why the governance of Duke Huan and Duke Wen is deemed shameful in the Confucian school, and why Zichan’s benevolence is criticized by Confucius.\n\nConsider Ji Liang, who revered the divine physician—even matters of life and death could not sway him. Or Duke Jing of Qi, who wept upon seeing his capital’s walls—yet remained confused by the very thresholds of benefit and harm. All was fate, and the distinction between understanding and ignorance was thus. This is why Liezi could not escape debate.\n\nNevertheless, Beigongzi once felt shame for his disregard of fate when compared to Ximenzi, who achieved success through his endeavors. Yet upon awakening, he forgot both honor and disgrace, remaining at ease for the rest of his life. If this is so, then even one who disregards fate—can fate truly constrain him?\n\nLiezi’s intent was to clarify his own awakening in order to awaken those who had not yet understood, urging them to seek enlightenment. Though the central theme of his chapter dispels the confusion between force and fate, he ultimately concludes that force must not be abandoned and fate must not be ignored—this is the ultimate truth of fate. Thus, he concludes with the teachings on official service, farming, craftsmanship, and commerce as the workings of fate.\n\n*Explication of the Perfect Dao of Profound Virtue*, Scroll Fourteen—concluded.\n*Explication of the Perfect Dao of Profound Virtue*, Scroll Fifteen.",

      "translated_text": "Submitted by Jiang Yu, an Inner Hall Student of Hangzhou Prefecture School in Song\n\n**Yang Zhu, Chapter One**\n\nYang Zhu traveled to Lu and lodged at the Meng residence. Meng asked him, “Man is but man—why then pursue fame?”\nYang Zhu replied, “Fame is sought for wealth.”\n“Once wealthy, why not cease?”\n“For nobility.”\n“Once noble, why not cease?”\n“For death.”\n“After death, what remains?”\n“For descendants.”\n“What benefit does fame bring to descendants?”\n“Fame is as one’s own body, straining the heart. Those who ride fame bring blessings to their clans, profit to their villages—how much more to their descendants? Yet all who pursue fame cultivate frugality, and frugality leads to poverty. Those who pursue fame must yield, and yielding leads to lowliness.”\n\nMeng said, “When Guan Zhong served as minister of Qi, the lord indulged, and so did he; the lord was extravagant, and so was he. Their wills aligned, their words followed, and the Way was enacted—Qi became a hegemon. Yet after his death, only the Guan clan remained. When the Tian clan served Qi, if the lord was full, they diminished themselves; if the lord taxed, they gave. The people all turned to them, and thus they came to possess Qi. Their descendants have enjoyed it to this day without end. If true fame impoverishes, then false fame enriches.”\n\nYang Zhu said, “Truth has no fame, and fame has no truth. Fame is but pretense. Long ago, Yao and Shun feigned yielding the world to Xu You and Shan Juan yet did not lose it, reigning for a hundred years. Boyi and Shuqi truly yielded the rulership of Guzhu, yet their state perished, and they starved on Mount Shouyang. The distinction between truth and pretense is thus made clear.”\n\n*Explication*:\nThe constant Dao has no name; names arise only after things are formed and their numbers fixed. The wise detest the chaos of affairs and things, and so, out of necessity, they impose names upon them. Names are not natural—all within the realm of the nameable is but pretense. Yet though names issue trust, they must rely on reality; reality does not manifest itself and must borrow names. The noble-minded do not resent following names to tread reality; they resent only clinging to names and burdening reality.\n\nThe careless multitude, unaware that their bodies do not truly belong to them, pursue wealth and nobility in life. Unaware that their descendants do not belong to them, they compete for empty fame after death. At first, they seek reality through fame; in the end, they seek fame to the detriment of reality. If reality is not fame, then why did Guan’s extravagance bring no benefit to his descendants? If fame is not reality, how did Tian’s generosity lead to their possession of Qi? Names cannot be discarded, nor can they be pursued. Pursuing names destroys reality; amassing reality establishes names.\n\nMoreover, if one pursues the present, then Boyi and Shuqi’s yielding is not as good as Yao and Shun’s pretense. If one cares for posterity, then Guan Zhong’s extravagance is not as good as the Tian clan’s generosity. To seek both fame and reality—how is this possible?\n\nLiezi did not value worldly wealth and nobility, nor was he unaware that Yao, Shun, Boyi, and Shuqi did not seek fame yet gained it, becoming objects of universal praise for later ages. Even the sage’s engagement with the world, daily entanglement in affairs, inevitably produces names—all within the realm of judgment. Liezi spoke thus to urge scholars to devote themselves to the nameless Dao.\n\nIf one feigns benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and teaching to steal the world’s empty fame, not only will they fail to gain fame, but they will lose even the profit they might have had—far worse than thieves who at least indulge their desires in life. This is perhaps an overcorrection, a necessary exaggeration.\n\nYang Zhu said, “A hundred years is the utmost span of life. Among a thousand, not one attains it. Even if one does, half is spent in infancy, dotage, and old age. Half of what remains is lost to sleep at night and distraction by day. Half of what is left is consumed by pain, illness, sorrow, loss, worry, and fear. In the few years that remain, moments of ease and self-contentment, free from care, are rare indeed. For what, then, does man live? For what joy? For fine food and abundance. For music and beauty. Yet fine food cannot always satisfy, nor can music and beauty always be enjoyed. Then one is bound by rewards and punishments, advanced or restrained by fame and law. Restlessly, one competes for fleeting reputation, schemes for posthumous glory, anxiously obeys the sights and sounds of the senses, and clings to the judgments of body and mind. The supreme joy of the present is lost, and one cannot indulge even for a moment. How is this different from a prisoner in heavy shackles?”\n\n*Explication*:\nA hundred years of life are worn down by cares. Yin and yang assail from without; desires gnaw from within. Nothing is strong or enduring—all becomes illness and vexation. At night, the spirit labors in sleep; by day, the body toils in wakefulness. How can one not harbor fleeting anxieties even for a moment? Yet these anxieties, when held, bring worry and fear; when released, bring ease and joy. Holding or releasing them lies within oneself. Why, then, do people so often tread the path of care? Do they willingly embrace suffering? No—it is because they take fine food and beauty as joy that they compete for reputation, scheme for glory, guard their senses, and cling to judgments. Anxious and restless, they are bound by rewards and punishments, advanced or restrained by fame and law, daily mired in care without self-awareness.\n\nThus, in a hundred years of life, one fails both to attain the inner joy of heaven and to indulge even for a moment—both are lost. How is this different from a prisoner in heavy shackles? Zhuangzi also called this a long illness, a prolonged affliction from which one does not die. Did Liezi truly wish for the people to indulge in the pleasures of music and beauty?",

      "translated_text": "Indeed, those who scramble in vain for hollow reputations bring no benefit to themselves—far better to cast off restraint and pursue the joys rightful to life. Yet is this not itself a corrective overreach?\n\nThe people of the great antiquity knew life as a fleeting arrival and death as a fleeting departure. Thus they followed their hearts in action, never resisting what nature inclined them to love. The pleasures of the present body were not to be forsaken, so they were not swayed by the lure of fame. They roamed in accord with their nature, never opposing what the myriad things inclined them to love. Posthumous renown was not to be sought, so they were not touched by the reach of punishment. Fame and infamy, long life and short—these were not matters for their reckoning.\n\nThe *Explanation* says: Death and life are but a going and a returning. The people of great antiquity, their great simplicity yet undispersed, their primal integrity uncarved by human artifice, could trace things back to their origin and return to their end, thus knowing the discourse on death and life. Thereby they followed their hearts in action and roamed in accord with their nature, going nowhere without a sense of ease and self-possession.\n\nNature is to the heart as substance is to function. To depart from nature and then follow the heart is to act in accord with the heart, thus never resisting what nature inclines one to love. To roam in accord with one’s nature is then to never oppose what the myriad things incline them to love. Moreover, action may be constrained, but roaming is ever fitting. Following the heart in action, one does not forsake the pleasures of the present body—this is not to seek the good of near-term fame, so one is not swayed by fame. Roaming in accord with one’s nature, one does not scheme for posthumous renown—this is not to seek the evil of near-term punishment, so one is not touched by punishment. Those who are thus do not see the changes of life and death as anything more than the constant alternation of night and day. How then would they have leisure to calculate the precedence of fame and infamy or measure the length of life and span of years?\n\nYang Zhu said: What distinguishes the myriad things is life; what they share is death. In life there are the worthy and the foolish, the noble and the base—this is what distinguishes them. In death there is putrefaction and dissolution—this is what they share. Yet the worthy and the foolish, the noble and the base are not within one’s power; putrefaction and dissolution are likewise not within one’s power. Thus life is not what one lives, death is not what one dies, worthiness is not what one makes worthy, foolishness is not what one makes foolish, nobility is not what one makes noble, baseness is not what one makes base. Yet the myriad things are equally born, equally die, equally worthy, equally foolish, equally noble, equally base. Whether one dies at ten or a hundred, whether one is a sage or a tyrant, a fool or a brute—all alike become rotting bones. Rotting bones are one and the same: who knows their distinctions? Why then hasten to the present life and trouble oneself over what comes after death?\n\nThe *Explanation* says: Life and death alternate, originally without sameness or difference. Petty wisdom, self-serving in its smallness, falsely sees difference within sameness, then posits sameness on the basis of difference—thus the sameness and difference of life and death become confused and indistinguishable. Yang Zhu sought to equalize the changes of life and death and make them one. Thus, taking the common view that sees life as different and death as the same, he ultimately returns to a state beyond sameness and difference. If one were to abruptly speak to them of the ultimate unity of the Way, they would be thrown into confusion amid their doubts, and their delusions would remain unresolved. This is the sage’s constant skill in saving people.\n\nMoreover, in equalizing the changes of the myriad things, one must speak of Yao and Shun, Jie and Zhou—only by dispelling the world’s deepest delusions can one properly use the extremes of the mad and the sage, those whom all under heaven and all generations trust. To say that Yao and Shun are the same as Jie and Zhou is no idle claim. The traces of Yao and Shun’s response to the world, their adaptation to the times and compliance with change, could not avoid some degree of attachment—how then could their traces fail to converge in rotting bones? As for what made Yao and Shun truly Yao and Shun, this is what Confucius called “so vast that the people could find no name for it”—how could this be the same as the rotting bones of Jie and Zhou?\n\nYang Zhu said: Boyi did not lack desires—his pride in purity led him to starve to death. Zhan Zi did not lack passions—his pride in integrity led him to leave his lineage diminished. The errors of purity and integrity are thus manifest in goodness itself.\n\nThe *Explanation* says: In human life, passions give rise to desires, and desires give rise to love. If desires are not moderated, they overflow into cravings, nurturing likes and dislikes, and the natural endowment of life and destiny becomes diseased—this is how goodness itself becomes error. If what one prides oneself on is purity and integrity, then one can restrain one’s passions and moderate one’s desires—how then is this an error of goodness? Yet Boyi and Zhan Zi, though they bore the names of purity and integrity, harbored the intention to correct excess and remedy flaws, so their traces could not avoid some degree of attachment—thus they too were enslaved by passions and desires. To the point of starving to death or leaving one’s lineage diminished—is it not fitting to call this an error of goodness? Thus the sage follows the course of the mean as his constant principle and does not go to extremes.\n\nYang Zhu said: Yuan Xian was impoverished in Lu; Zigong amassed wealth in Wei. Yuan Xian’s poverty harmed his life; Zigong’s wealth burdened his person. If poverty is not permissible and wealth is not permissible, where then lies the permissible? It lies in delighting in life and in freeing the body. Thus one who is good at delighting in life is not impoverished; one who is good at freeing the body is not wealthy.\n\nThe *Explanation* says: In human life, one must rely on things for sustenance—plowing to eat and weaving to clothe oneself are unavoidable. Even the people of great antiquity were no exception, save that they did not cast their gaze left and right to snare profit amid riches and honor, nor did they allow officials to monopolize the fields. The former path avoids poverty—this is how one delights in life. The latter path avoids wealth—this is how one frees the body. For one who is impoverished wears a hempen cap and straw sandals, leaning on a staff of brambles—how can one speak of delighting in life? For one who is wealthy is weighed down by cares and anxieties, ever seeking more—how can one speak of freeing the body? From this one knows that the Way of Liezi does not go to extremes and has never been wholly unmindful of the peace or peril of the world’s course.",

      "translated_text": "Yang Zhu said: There is an ancient saying: \"In life, we cherish one another; in death, we abandon one another.\" This saying reaches the utmost truth. The way of cherishing in life is not merely about affection; it is through diligence that one attains ease, through hunger that one finds satiety, through cold that one knows warmth, through poverty that one achieves success. The way of abandonment in death is not that one feels no sorrow; it is that no pearls or jades are placed within, no patterned brocades are worn, no sacrificial animals are offered, and no funerary objects are set out.\n\nThe commentary states: The establishment of later kings and lords to govern the people of the world is meant to ensure they do not neglect their duties—this is the way of cherishing in life. But when it comes to death, all is simplified; even good friends do no more than sigh in eternal lament—this is the way of abandonment.\n\nYan Pingzhong asked Guan Yiwu about nurturing life. Guan Yiwu replied: \"Let it be, without obstruction or restraint.\" Yan Pingzhong asked: \"What does this entail?\" Yiwu said: \"Indulge the ears in what they wish to hear, the eyes in what they wish to see, the nose in what it wishes to smell, the mouth in what it wishes to speak, the body in what it wishes to rest, and the mind in what it wishes to do. If the ears desire to hear sounds but are not allowed to listen, this is called stifling hearing. If the eyes desire to see beauty but are not allowed to look, this is called stifling sight. If the nose desires the scent of pepper and orchid but is not allowed to smell, this is called stifling scent. If the mouth desires to speak of right and wrong but is not allowed to speak, this is called stifling wisdom. If the body desires comfort but is not allowed to follow it, this is called stifling ease. If the mind desires to act freely but is not allowed to do so, this is called stifling nature. All these stiflings are the tyrants of oppression. To cast off these oppressive tyrants and await death in joyful ease—whether for a day, a month, a year, or ten years—this is what I call nurturing life. To be bound by these oppressive tyrants, clinging to them without release, and living in sorrow for a long life—whether a hundred years, a thousand years, or ten thousand years—this is not what I call nurturing life.\"\n\nThe commentary states: When Master Liezi studied under Old Shangzi, after three years, his heart dared not contemplate right and wrong, and his mouth dared not speak of profit and harm. Thus, in what his mouth wished to speak and his mind wished to do, he could not indulge freely. For this reason, Old Shangzi first relaxed his countenance and smiled upon seeing him. After nine years, whatever his heart contemplated and whatever his mouth spoke, he could indulge and act freely without obstruction or restraint. Thus, Old Shangzi acknowledged his progress in both inner and outer cultivation. The so-called indulgence of the ears in hearing, the eyes in seeing, the nose in smelling, and the body in resting is like this—it does not mean indulging in sounds, sights, scents, and tastes to violate what human principles abhor, and only then is it called indulgence. One who can advance in this way has truly heard the Dao. \"To hear the Dao in the morning, one may die in the evening.\" Thus, even a life of a day or a month is sufficient for nurturing, so why cling to a long life in sorrow? This is Liezi’s ultimate principle of nurturing life. What Guan Zhong, Yanzi, and Zeng Xi did not do—how could they have advanced in this Dao?\n\nYan Pingzhong’s pork shoulder never filled his plate—he was one who practiced frugality in person. Guan Yiwu had three returning cups and a wine stand—he was one who loved luxury. Yan Pingzhong’s question and Guan Yiwu’s answer were naturally as they were. Their exchange was like the principle of fruits and melons; their words happened to align with the Dao. Thus, Liezi adopted their sayings to convey the ultimate Dao, not intending for scholars to emulate what Guan and Yan did.\n\nGuan Yiwu said: \"I have already told you about nurturing life. What of sending off the dead?\" Yan Pingzhong replied: \"Sending off the dead is a matter of simplicity. What more is there to say?\" Guan Yiwu said: \"I still wish to hear of it.\" Pingzhong said: \"Once dead, what is it to me? Burning is acceptable, sinking is acceptable, burying is acceptable, exposing is acceptable, wrapping in firewood and casting into a ravine is acceptable, or adorning with embroidered robes and placing in a stone outer coffin is acceptable—whatever one encounters.\"\n\nGuan Yiwu turned to Bao Shu and Huangzi and said: \"The way of sending off the dead—we two have advanced in it.\"\n\nThe commentary states: For one who has attained the Dao, sending off the dead means taking heaven and earth as the coffin and outer coffin, the sun and moon as paired jades, the stars as pearls and ornaments, and the myriad things as offerings. In this, what encounter could not be fitting?\n\n*Explication of the Perfect Virtue of the Vacuous and Unwavering Classic, Scroll Fifteen, concludes.*\n*Explication of the Perfect Virtue of the Vacuous and Unwavering Classic, Scroll Sixteen.*",

      "translated_text": "The memorial submitted by Jiang Yu, an inner student of the Hangzhou Prefecture Academy of Song:\n\nDuring Yang Zhu’s era, Zichan governed Zheng, monopolizing the state’s administration. After three years, the virtuous admired his transformation, the wicked feared his prohibitions, Zheng was well-ordered, and the feudal lords stood in awe. Yet he had an elder brother named Gongsun Chao and a younger brother named Gongsun Mu. Chao was fond of wine, and Mu was fond of women.\n\nIn Chao’s residence, a thousand *zhong* of wine were amassed, fermented dregs piled into mounds. From a hundred paces beyond the gate, the stench of lees and swill assailed the nostrils. When he was lost in drink, he knew nothing of the world’s peace or peril, the regrets and humiliations of human affairs, the prosperity or ruin of his household, the closeness or estrangement of his nine clans, or the sorrow and joy of life and death. Even if water and fire, blades and weapons clashed before him, he remained oblivious.\n\nMu’s rear courtyard held dozens of chambers, each filled with young, supple beauties. When he was immersed in sensuality, he cast aside close kin, severed friendships, and fled to the inner quarters, sating himself day and night. He emerged but once every three months, yet still felt unsatisfied. If a maiden of surpassing beauty dwelled in the village, he would bribe and summon her, employ matchmakers to entice her, and only desist if he failed to obtain her.\n\nZichan grieved over this day and night. Secretly, he sought Deng Xi’s counsel, saying: “I have heard that governing the self leads to governing the household, and governing the household leads to governing the state—this speaks of proceeding from the near to the far. I have brought order to the state, yet my household is in chaos. Is my Way perverse? What method can save these two?” Deng Xi replied: “I have long found this strange but dared not speak first. Why not admonish them in due time, enlightening them on the weight of life and destiny, enticing them with the dignity of ritual and righteousness?”\n\nZichan heeded Deng Xi’s words. Seizing an opportunity, he visited his brothers and said: “What elevates humans above beasts is wisdom. What wisdom guides is ritual and righteousness. When ritual and righteousness are perfected, fame and rank follow. If you act on impulse, indulging your desires, your life and destiny will be imperiled. Heed my words, and by evening, Chao will repent and receive emolument.”\n\nChao and Mu replied: “We have long known this and long deliberated upon it. Do we need your words to recognize it? Life is hard to encounter, death easy to reach. With a life so difficult to attain, awaiting a death so easily come—how can one not ponder this? To exalt ritual and righteousness to impress others, to feign nature and temperament for fame—we deem this worse than death. We wish to exhaust a lifetime’s joy, to plumb the year’s utmost pleasure. Our only fear is a belly too full to drink to our heart’s content, strength too spent to indulge our passions. We have no leisure to fret over foul reputations or perilous lives.”\n\n“Moreover, you boast of your governance to sway others, seeking to confuse our hearts with fine words, to delight our minds with honor and emolument—is this not base and pitiable? We wish to part ways with you. Those who excel at governing the external may not bring order to things, yet their persons suffer. Those who excel at governing the internal may not bring chaos to things, yet their natures find ease. Your governance of the external may be temporarily enforced in one state, but it does not accord with human hearts. Our governance of the internal can be extended to all under heaven, and the Way of ruler and minister will cease. We have long wished to instruct you in this art, yet you turn and teach us yours instead.”\n\nZichan was left speechless. Later, he recounted this to Deng Xi, who said: “You have dwelled with true persons yet do not recognize them. Who calls you wise? Zheng’s order is but a coincidence, not your achievement.”\n\n*Explication states:* Indulging passion in sensuality is what deludes and enthralls human sentiment, what human principles deem most shameful. Gluttonous drinking is what all human sentiment desires, what the former kings warned against. The common person’s sentiment craves the sight of beauty. When denied to the point of blindness, it is not that they truly suppress desire, but that they fear peril to life and are restrained from indulgence. The mouth craves fine flavors. When denied to the point of satiation, it is not that they truly forget preferences, but that they shun foul reputations and are deterred from indulgence.\n\nThus, exalting ritual and righteousness, feigning nature and temperament, may appear outwardly as if one can be serene and effortless. Yet in their seated reverie, their thoughts race in an instant beyond the four seas, their aspirations and intentions reaching everywhere, accomplishing anything. If so, a hundred years of life will inwardly torment their hearts and minds, outwardly afflict their forms and bodies. Where is the joy in such life?\n\nAs for Chao and Mu’s conduct, it is simply genuine. Their so-called gluttonous drinking is not drowning in wine. Their so-called indulgence in sensuality is not wallowing in lust. For Chao and Mu have long understood the peace and peril of the world’s ways, the gains and losses of human principles, and long deliberated upon them. Desiring to exhaust a lifetime’s joy, to plumb the year’s utmost pleasure, they drink to their heart’s content and indulge their passions. Though their reputations may be foul, they do not fret over perilous lives, nor do they spare a thought for it. This is what is called governing the internal without governing the external, having no shame before the Dao and virtue, daring to act on perverse impulses without adhering to the conduct of benevolence and righteousness.\n\nTheir genuine Way of governing the self, if extended and practiced, could bring the world to effortless order. Yet Zichan busies himself ferrying people across the Zhen and Wei rivers, his governance inevitably criticized by the people and humbled by Deng Xi. This is what is called excelling at governing the external—things may not be ordered, yet the person suffers. Though his methods may be temporarily enforced in one state, they do not accord with human hearts. How could he understand the genuineness of these two?",

      "translated_text": "To fail to comprehend this is one thing, yet to further confuse the mind with clever words, to let honor and disgrace sway the will—such sincerity is contemptible, and such intent pitiable. Ruling Zheng in this manner and monopolizing its governance, even if the virtuous submit to its transformation and the wicked fear its prohibitions, they remain ignorant of the true principles of order. Any success is merely accidental—how can it be called achievement? In the court of Mu, Zichan stood between the ranks of Ji and Meng, yet his conduct and aspirations were unequal, and his governance of internal and external affairs diverged so starkly. Thus it is said: if the Way could be conveyed to others, none would fail to share it with their brothers.\n\nAs for Deng Xi, initially he had not yet examined the Way of the court of Mu, so upon hearing Zichan’s words, he shared his sorrow. Later, having grasped the Way of the court of Mu, he heard Zichan’s words and diverged in understanding. Alas! Without Deng Xi’s words, later observers of the court of Mu would nearly all share Zichan’s sorrow and never perceive the truth.\n\nWei’s Duanmu Shu was a descendant of Zigong, who inherited his family’s wealth, amassing tens of thousands in gold. Unconcerned with worldly affairs, he indulged his every inclination. Whatever the people desired to do or fancied to enjoy, he did and enjoyed without restraint. His mansions, terraces, gardens, ponds, feasts, carriages, robes, music, and concubines rivaled those of the lords of Qi and Chu. Whatever his heart desired, his ears wished to hear, his eyes wished to see, or his mouth wished to taste—even if it came from distant lands or remote states, beyond what Qi’s soil could produce—he procured it all as readily as if it were within his own walls. In his travels, though mountains and rivers blocked the way, the paths were long and the distances vast, he ventured without hesitation, as easily as taking a single step. Daily, hundreds of guests filled his halls, his kitchens never ceased their smoke and flame, and his halls and corridors never stilled their music.\n\nFrom the surplus of his provisions, he first distributed to his clansmen; what remained, he gave to his village; and what still remained, he scattered throughout the state. At sixty, his vitality waning, he abandoned his household affairs and dispersed his storehouses of treasures, carriages, robes, and concubines. Within a year, all was gone, leaving no wealth for his descendants. When he fell ill, he had no medicines stored; when he died, no resources for burial. The people of the state who had received his bounty gathered to contribute, returning his wealth to his descendants.\n\nQin Guli heard of this and said: \"Duanmu Shu is a madman, a disgrace to his ancestors.\" Duangan Sheng heard of it and said: \"Duanmu Shu is an enlightened man, his virtue surpassing his ancestors.\" What he did and how he lived startled the common mind, yet the truth of principle affirmed it.

His heart was filled with anxiety and distress, ever seeking more without cease—truly a life of sorrow. With Zigong’s riches, he could have lived out his days in grand estates, fine robes, rich flavors, and fair companions, lacking nothing. Yet his endless pursuit of gain arose from scheming for his descendants’ endless future. Alas! Grandchildren are not your possessions; to claim and hold them as such is delusion. Moreover, he tormented his body, forwent sweetness, and denied his own sustenance, only to be cast aside by the sages for his mercantile ways. In striving to suit his own desires, was this not a great tragedy?\n\nAs for Duanmu Shu: inheriting his family’s wealth, he never knew the toil of commerce yet bore the weight of ten thousand gold. Having it, he knew how to use it. Thus, he indulged his every inclination, doing all he wished and delighting in all he fancied. In ease and contentment, his aspirations fulfilled, he rivaled the lords of Qi and Chu. Not only did he know how to use wealth, but as his vital qi neared its decline, he scattered and exhausted all he had. By common judgment, he was most unkind to his descendants’ legacy. Yet later, those who received his bounty returned his wealth to his descendants—so he was not without bequest after all.\n\nAlas! Duanmu Shu lived free from the burden of commerce, exhausting a lifetime of joy. In death, he left no wealth for his descendants yet did not lose it for them. His conduct and deeds startled the common mind, yet the truth of principle affirmed them. Where truth resides, only the sage can fully grasp it.

Life is not preserved by valuing it, nor is the body enriched by cherishing it. Moreover, what is the purpose of long life? The five passions of love and hate were the same in ancient times as now; the safety and peril of the four limbs were the same in ancient times as now; the bitterness and joy of worldly affairs were the same in ancient times as now; the alternations of order and chaos were the same in ancient times as now. Having heard of these, having seen them, having experienced them, one finds even a hundred years wearisome in their excess—how much more the suffering of long life!\"\n\nMeng Sunyang said: \"If this is so, then swift death is preferable to long life. Thus, treading upon blades, plunging into boiling water—one would attain one’s desire.\" Yangzi replied: \"Not so. Once born, one should relinquish and entrust it, exhausting one’s desires while awaiting death. When death approaches, one should relinquish and entrust it, exhausting one’s course to its fullest end. There is nothing not relinquished, nothing not entrusted—why hastily distinguish between swift and slow?\"\n\nExplanation: Confined by having life, life does not struggle against form, yet form must ultimately decay. Enslaved by transformation, transformation constantly flows through form—how can form endure? Thus, a hundred years is the greatest span of longevity, yet among a thousand, not one attains it. In principle, one may not achieve long life—how much less immortality? Examining life’s existence and cessation, it does not originally belong to me. Observing life’s cares and troubles, one clings to long life. While one has life, within your form, the five passions’ loves and hates churn within; within your body, the four limbs’ safety and peril press without. In a single lifetime, the myriad affairs’ bitterness and joy converge before you. The changes of a day are no different from those of a month; the shifts of a year are no different from those of a hundred. Having heard and known them, having seen and recognized them, having experienced and passed through them—how can one still seek long life?\n\nYet though death and life are but morning and evening, why rejoice in life? Why grieve over death? One should not, because life is insufficient cause for joy, weary of long life; nor should one, because death is insufficient cause for sorrow, delight in swift death. Thus, those who attain the Dao regard life and death: once born, they relinquish and entrust it, exhausting their desires while awaiting death, not binding themselves to the ditches’ self-strangulation. When death approaches, they relinquish and entrust it, exhausting their course to its fullest end, not clinging to the longevity of exhaling the old and inhaling the new. Though they have no intention of long life, if they attain the longevity of Peng, they do not weary of it. Though they have no intention of swift death, if they meet the early demise of Yan, they follow transformation. Nothing is not relinquished, nothing is not entrusted—thus it is, and no more.\n\nYang Zhu said: \"Bo Cheng Zigao did not use a single hair’s benefit for others. He abandoned his state and retired to plow in seclusion. Great Yu did not use his own body for self-benefit, leaving one part of his body withered. The ancients would not sacrifice a single hair to benefit the world, nor would they take the whole world to serve a single body. If each person does not sacrifice a single hair, and each person does not benefit the world, the world will be well-ordered.\"\n\nExplanation: In the *Yi*, diminishing the lower to enrich the upper is called \"diminishing\"; diminishing the upper to enrich the lower is called \"enriching.\" Enrichment must entail diminishment, and diminishment must ultimately lead to enrichment. Diminishment and enrichment are the principles of fullness and emptiness, growth and decline. As for the generation of the myriad things, all equally embody the supreme principle, without deficiency or excess. Add a single hair, and nature has no room for excess; remove a single hair, and nature has no surplus. Thus, to enrich is to diminish, and to diminish is to enrich—both miss the mark. What could be more chaotic than calling this \"order\"? Only one who does not employ diminishment or enrichment attains the way of mutual benefit for self and others.\n\n*Zhuangzi* speaks of the time from Rong Cheng to the era of Shen Nong, when the people savored their food, admired their clothing, delighted in their customs, and rested content in their dwellings, living to old age without visiting one another—this could be called each person not sacrificing a single hair, each person not benefiting the world. In such a time, perfect order prevailed.\n\nQinzi asked Yang Zhu: \"Would you pluck a single hair from your body to save the world?\" Yangzi replied: \"The world is certainly not saved by a single hair.\" Qinzi said: \"Suppose it could be saved—would you do it?\" Yangzi did not respond. Qinzi went out and told Meng Sunyang, who said: \"You do not understand the Master’s heart. Allow me to explain. If someone could gain ten thousand gold by harming your skin, would you do it?\" \"I would.\" Meng Sunyang said: \"If someone could gain a state by severing one of your joints, would you do it?\" Qinzi fell silent for a while. Meng Sunyang said: \"A single hair is finer than skin, and skin is finer than a joint—this is evident. Yet it is by accumulating hairs that skin is formed, and by accumulating skin that joints are formed. A single hair is but one ten-thousandth of the body—how can you regard it as light?\" Qinzi said: \"I cannot answer you. However, if you asked Lao Dan and Guan Yin with your words, your words would be correct; if I asked Yu or Mo Di with my words, my words would be correct.\" Meng Sunyang then turned and discussed other matters with his disciples.\n\nExplanation: Those who speak of Yangzi claim his way is centered on self-interest, thus even if it meant plucking a single hair from his body to save the world, he would not do it. Yet *Liezi* records his words differently. Yangzi’s meaning was this: the greatness of the world cannot be saved by a single hair. Since a single hair is insufficient to save the world, why speak of a hypothetical salvation?",

      "translated_text": "Qinzi’s question was likewise ill-considered, and so Yangzi did not respond. Yangzi’s intent was this: though a single hair and the skin differ in magnitude, the skin is but an accumulation of hairs, and since both are parts of my body, both are equally worthy of love—why then value a joint over a single hair? If one could lead every person to honor life and cherish its root without slighting even a single hair, the world would be more than well-governed.\n\nYangzi’s love for a single hair was not love for the hair itself, but love for his own body. All people love their bodies yet fail to cherish even a single hair; if they do not cherish a single hair, the neglect accumulates until they harm their very bodies without realizing it. They approve of loving the body but disapprove of loving a single hair—how thoughtless this is!\n\nI have observed that in human life, the noble rule the base, the low serve the exalted, and all spend their days toiling, laboring for things external, never reserving even the slightest for themselves. Have they never considered whether their lives exist for themselves or for others? If their lives are truly their own, why do they not act for themselves? And if they exist for others, yet cannot even govern themselves, how can they govern others?\n\n*Liezi* deeply despised those who chase after the ten thousand things without turning back, and so his book often attributes to Yangzi the doctrine of self-interest. Qinzi never grasped Yangzi’s meaning; instead, he claimed that if his words were put to Yu or Mo Di, they would be correct. But this merely shows he saw the traces of Yu and Mo Di, for he understood neither Yangzi nor Yu and Mo Di. Meng Sunyang then turned away and discussed other matters with his disciples, for Qinzi’s words were not of the same kind.\n\nYang Zhu said: The world’s praise is heaped upon Shun, Yu, the Zhou kings, and Confucius, while its blame falls upon Jie and Zhou. Yet Shun tilled the fields at Heyang and made pottery at Leize, his limbs never knowing rest, his mouth and belly never tasting fine fare. His parents did not love him, his siblings did not befriend him. At thirty, he married without informing them. When he received Yao’s abdication, he was already old, his wisdom in decline. When Shangjun proved unworthy, he abdicated to Yu, living in sorrow until his death—such was the bitter end of this man revered as a sage. Gun failed in his governance of flood and earth, and was executed at Feather Mountain. Yu inherited his work and avenged his father, laboring endlessly over barren lands. He had no time to raise his son, passed his own door without entering, his body withered, his hands and feet calloused. When he received Shun’s abdication, he humbled his palaces and adorned his robes and crowns, living in sorrow until his death—such was the toil of this man revered as a sage. After King Wu’s death, King Cheng was young and weak, and the Duke of Zhou took up the regency. The Duke of Shao was displeased, and the four states spread rumors. The Duke of Zhou lived in the east for three years, executed his brother, and exiled another, barely escaping with his life, living in sorrow until his death—such was the peril of this man revered as a sage. Confucius expounded the Way of the sage-kings and responded to the summons of rulers of his time. He was driven to fell a tree in Song, erased his traces in Wei, impoverished in Shang and Zhou, besieged in Chen and Cai, humiliated by the Ji family, insulted by Yang Hu, living in sorrow until his death—such was the harried life of this man revered as a sage.\n\nAll four of these sages lived without a single day of joy, yet died with names revered for ten thousand generations. But a name is not something one can truly possess. Though praised, they knew it not; though rewarded, they knew it not—no different from a clod of earth or a block of wood.\n\nJie inherited the resources of generations, sitting upon the throne of the Son of Heaven. His wisdom was sufficient to overawe his ministers, his might enough to shake the realm. He indulged his ears and eyes in every pleasure, exhausted his thoughts in every desire, living in bliss until his death—such was the wanton ease of this man reviled as a tyrant.

      "translated_text": "They did not torment themselves with ritual and righteousness, yet blissfully met their execution—such were the reckless among heaven’s people. Those two fiends enjoyed the pleasures of desire in life, but in death bore the name of folly and brutality. For reality is not something a name can confer; though reviled, they knew it not; though praised, they knew it not—how did they differ from a clod of earth or a block of wood?\n\nThose four sages, though the fairest of all, toiled to the end of their days, yet all alike met death. Those two fiends, though the foulest of all, reveled to the end of theirs, yet all alike met death.\n\nExplanation: Shun was the most illustrious of emperors, Yu the foremost of kings, the Duke of Zhou the paragon of loyalty and sagacity, and Confucius the brightest expositor of the Dao—all were the highest exemplars of sagehood, revered and cherished by all under heaven for ten thousand generations. Yet Shun’s bitter hardships, Yu’s cares and toils, the Duke of Zhou’s fears and trepidations, and Confucius’ haste and distress—when examined against the records of the Yu, Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties, and weighed against Confucius’ own words, the truth of their suffering is beyond doubt. To say they lived in constant sorrow until death is no exaggeration.\n\nAs for Jie and Zhou, their wanton ease and reckless indulgence, their unbridled delight in the pleasures of ear and eye, their exhaustive pursuit of every desire, their unrestrained passions in the Leaning Palace, their unchecked desires through long nights—this may indeed be called blissful fulfillment of every wish. All under heaven ascribe beauty to Shun, Yu, the Duke of Zhou, and Confucius, calling them the Four Sages; all under heaven ascribe evil to Jie and Zhou, calling them the Two Fiends. The Four Sages bore the empty name of ten thousand generations, while the Two Fiends enjoyed the real benefits of their own lifetimes. For reality is not something a name can confer, nor is a name something reality can claim. In the end, what we call praise or blame is merely passed down through the ages. How can those who praise or blame know the truth of what came before? And how can those who are praised or blamed know what comes after? Though there be praise or blame, how does it differ from a clod of earth or a block of wood? Is it not fitting, then, to say that beauty and evil alike meet the same end in death?\n\nLiezi speaks thus not to urge the world to abandon the names of the Four Sages and pursue the reality of the Two Fiends, but to make seekers of the Dao discern that both name and reality are equally illusory, and to recognize that sorrow and joy are equal burdens. Thus, he uses the common judgments of all under heaven for ten thousand generations to show that one should forsake the traces of the sages and seek the Dao of the sages. Moreover, the Four Sages, content with heaven and knowing fate, were never truly troubled. What we call their hardships, cares, and fears were but unavoidable responses to the world, sharing in the fortunes and misfortunes of the people, and grieving the people’s sorrows. The name of sagehood and wisdom was bestowed upon them by others, and they did not refuse it. Only by understanding this can one grasp the meaning of Liezi’s words, for he walks the same Dao as the Four Sages.\n\n*Explication of the Perfect Virtue of the Vacuous and Unwobbling Classic*, Scroll Sixteen—Concluded\n*Explication of the Perfect Virtue of the Vacuous and Unwobbling Classic*, Scroll Seventeen",

      "translated_text": "**Submitted by Jiang Yu, an Inner Student of Hangzhou Prefecture School in Song**\n\n**Yang Zhu, Part Two**\n\nYang Zhu met with King Hui of Liang and said, \"Governing the world is as easy as turning one’s palm.\" The king replied, \"You cannot even govern one wife and one concubine, nor tend to a garden of three *mu*—how can you claim that governing the world is as easy as turning one’s palm?\"\n\nYang Zhu answered, \"Have you not seen a shepherd? A hundred sheep in a flock, led by a five-foot boy carrying a switch, will go east when he wishes and west when he wishes. But if Yao were to lead a single sheep while Shun followed with the switch, they could not move forward. Moreover, I have heard: a fish that can swallow a boat does not swim in shallow streams; the great swan soars high and does not alight in filthy ponds. Why? Because its reach is vast. The deep tones of *huangzhong* and *dalü* cannot accompany frivolous dances. Why? Because their resonance is too distant. Thus, those who govern the great do not govern the petty; those who achieve great deeds do not fuss over small ones. This is what I mean.\"\n\n*Explication:* Only when one understands what it means to govern as easily as turning one’s palm can one truly speak of governance. Yangzi said, \"The world is vast, yet its governance lies in the Dao; the Four Seas are distant, yet their governance lies in the heart.\" If one truly believes these words, then the Dao exists even without descending to the level of one’s belt—how much more effortless than turning one’s palm! If one can embody this Dao, then one may act without action, and the people will govern themselves; one may love stillness, and the people will correct themselves. Thus, by not governing, one governs. But if one insists on governing through governance, then even one wife and one concubine will overwhelm one’s capacity, and a garden of three *mu* will exhaust one’s strength—this is like Yao leading the sheep while Shun follows with the switch. Therefore, it is said: those who govern the great do not govern the petty; those who achieve great deeds do not fuss over small ones.\n\nYang Zhu said, \"The affairs of the distant past have vanished—who records them? The deeds of the Three Sovereigns exist as if they exist not; the affairs of the Five Emperors seem like waking dreams; the undertakings of the Three Kings appear now hidden, now revealed—of a hundred, not one is known. Even the events of one’s own lifetime are sometimes heard, sometimes seen—of ten thousand, not one is known. The matters before one’s eyes may endure or fade—of a thousand, not one is known. From the distant past to the present, the years are too numerous to count. Yet since Fuxi’s time, over three hundred thousand years have passed, and all distinctions of worth and folly, beauty and ugliness, success and failure, right and wrong have dissolved—only the swiftness or slowness of their passing remains. To pride oneself on fleeting praise or blame, to exhaust one’s spirit and body in pursuit of a name that may linger a few hundred years after death—how can this moisten dry bones? Where is the joy in life?\"\n\n*Explication:* Whatever can be spoken or done is nothing but affairs. If one does not depart from the realm of words and deeds, one cannot escape the workings of time and fate. Even the governance of the distant past involved affairs; the Way of the Sovereigns, the virtue of the Emperors, the achievements of the Kings—with each descending age, affairs grow more entangled. Judging by what the ears and eyes perceive, the knowledge of one may be double, fivefold, tenfold, a hundredfold, or even a thousandfold that of another. Extending this upward to the Yellow Emperor, some events exist as if they exist not, some seem like waking dreams, some appear or vanish—of a hundred, not one is known. As for the distant past, all is already lost—who records it? Thus, the traces of good and evil alike are all abandoned. If one believes goodness is to be pursued, then the name of goodness will also fade in time; if one believes evil is to be avoided, then the sound of evil will also vanish in time—only the swiftness or slowness of their passing remains. How can one be so deluded as to race endlessly after such fleeting distinctions?\n\nYet the affairs of the Sovereigns, Emperors, and Kings in responding to the world did not depart from the realm of the nameable—were they truly right? Were they truly wrong? The traces of emperors and kings arose from stimulus and response, compelled to act, without intent for fame, yet others attributed names to them. This differs from those who pride themselves on praise or blame to seek renown. Thus, though their worldly affairs passed with the times, what made them sages endures eternally. If it were not so, why would the governance of sages be esteemed?\n\nYang Zhu said, \"Humans resemble the category of Heaven and Earth, possessing the nature of the Five Constants. Among beings, the most intelligent are humans. Yet humans lack claws and teeth sufficient for defense, skin tough enough for protection, speed enough to flee harm, or fur and feathers to shield against cold and heat. They must rely on external things for sustenance, depending on wisdom rather than strength. Thus, what wisdom values is preserving the self; what strength devalues is encroaching upon others. Yet the body does not belong to oneself—once born, one cannot but preserve it; things do not belong to oneself—once obtained, one cannot but part with them. The body is the master of life, just as things are the master of sustenance. Though one preserves life, one cannot possess the body; though one does not discard things, one cannot possess them. To possess things or the body is to wrongly claim private ownership of the world’s body and the world’s things—only the sage does not do this. To regard the world’s body and the world’s things as public—only the perfected person does this. This is what is called the utmost of the utmost.\"\n\n*Explication:* In life, one must rely on things for sustenance—this is the foundation of nurturing life, the principle of safeguarding life, the truth of fulfilling life, and cannot be avoided. The body is the master of life, so to live, one must first not separate from form; things are the master of sustenance, so to nourish form, one must first rely on things. Yet there are those with surplus things who do not nourish their form, so though one does not discard things, one cannot possess them. There are those whose form remains intact yet whose life perishes, so though one preserves life, one cannot possess the body. People of the world do not know how to nourish form—how can they truly preserve life? To wrongly claim private ownership of the world’s body as one’s own, to wrongly claim private ownership of the world’s things for sustenance—this is to pursue what life has no use for.\"",

      "translated_text": "If the body remains intact yet the principle of life perishes, what is there in the world worth pursuing? Only the sage, perhaps, can abandon affairs and relinquish life’s concerns to attain wholeness of form and restoration of essence. Yet even the sage is but a harbinger of transformation, unable to forget the self. As for the perfected one who never strays from the true—such a one makes the world’s body public, so the body is no different from things; makes the world’s things public, so things are none other than the self. This is what *Zhuangzi*’s \"Attaining Life\" calls \"essence refined to the utmost,\" and what may be termed the ultimate of the ultimate.\n\nYang Zhu said: The people’s inability to rest stems from four causes—first, for longevity; second, for fame; third, for rank; fourth, for wealth. With these four, one fears ghosts, fears others, fears authority, fears punishment—this is what is called the fugitive. Life and death are determined by external forces. If one does not defy fate, why covet longevity? If one does not prize nobility, why covet fame? If one does not seek power, why covet rank? If one does not crave riches, why covet wealth? This is what is called the compliant. The world has no counterpart; fate is mastered from within.\n\nExplanation: At the beginning of life, all possess the way to longevity, and those who attain their constant nature live long. Holding fast to the everlasting and loving virtue, fame then follows, rank is achieved, and wealth becomes abundant—this is the sequence of the four. Human longevity naturally ranges from those above like Peng Zu to those below like the Five Hegemons of Yu. How can people’s greed for life ever cease? As for the martyr who dies for fame or the miser who dies for wealth—before obtaining, they fret over gain; after obtaining, they fret over loss. Their minds are tormented, their bodies labored, their lives spent in haste—when do they know a moment’s peace? Of the four, people can seldom possess them all. Even if one attains one, though they toil their whole lives, it is never enough to satisfy their desires. How much less can they satisfy their insatiable cravings if they pursue all four? This is why the people cannot rest.\n\nWith these four, one advances in pursuit and retreats in avoidance. In the unseen, they fear ghosts. In society, they feign emotions to avoid others’ reproach. Authority need not be wielded against them, yet they tremble in dread of its reach. Punishment need not be set for them, yet they quiver in fear of transgression. In the slightest movement, their frail selves are controlled by things, and the true master within is lost—this is what is called the fugitive. Little do they know that equalizing the changes of life and death allows one to forget longevity and brevity; discerning the wealth of contentment makes wealth and possessions unnecessary to pursue. Without carriages and robes to bind them, blades and saws do not touch them. Indifferent to order and chaos, they know neither demotion nor promotion. With nothing to covet within, they have nothing to fear without. Dwelling between heaven and earth, they move alone, enter alone, come alone, go alone—the world has no counterpart. This is called \"possessing alone.\" One who possesses alone is called the most noble.\n\nThus the saying goes: If one neither marries nor enters office, half of human desires are lost. If one neither eats nor wears clothes, the way of ruler and subject ceases. Explanation: Hunger drives one to eat, cold drives one to wear clothes—those with life cannot escape desire. With desire unfulfilled, strife arises, and the distinction between ruler and subject is thereby clarified. All people must eat and wear clothes, but not all marry or enter office. Marriage brings many troubles of human relations; office stirs the heart of envy. Is this not the root of the people’s inability to rest? One who neither marries nor enters office, though not entirely free of desires, is far removed from the common folk.\n\nAs for the cessation of the way of ruler and subject—this means both ruler and subject are at ease, neither knowing who serves whom nor seeking favor or praise. Thus the duty between ruler and subject cannot be abolished, but its way may cease. A Zhou proverb says: \"A farmer can be killed by sitting.\" Rising at dawn and returning at dusk, he takes this as the constant of his nature; sipping beans and chewing greens, he takes this as the height of flavor.",

      "translated_text": "A body with coarse, thick flesh and sinews knotted in tension, suddenly placed beneath soft silk curtains and fed with fine grains, meats, orchids, and citrus—such a heart grows fevered, the frame restless, and illness brews within. Should the lords of Shang and Lu share the toil of a field laborer, they would not endure even a single season before exhaustion. Thus, what the rustic finds at ease, what he deems most excellent, he calls unmatched under heaven.\n\n**Explanation:** All are human, yet if a field laborer were to receive the provisions of a ruler, he would fall ill; if the lords of Shang and Lu were to share the labor of a field hand, they would be spent. To abandon fine grains and follow a diet of greens is indeed difficult for human nature; to exchange greens for fine grains seems easy. Yet one cannot readily exchange the ease of the field laborer, for habit reshapes a person and cannot be swiftly altered. How much more so for those drowned in external things, content with vulgar learning—how can one expect them to change their habits and find rest in the supreme Dao? Surely those who have not pondered this deem it distant.\n\nLong ago in Song, there was a field laborer who wore only coarse hemp to survive the winter. When spring came and he tilled the eastern fields, he basked in the sun, unaware of the world’s grand halls, sheltered chambers, silk floss, or fox-fur robes. Turning to his wife, he said: *\"The warmth of the sun’s embrace is known to none. If I offered it to our lord, he would surely reward me richly.\"* A wealthy villager told him: *\"Once, a man praised the fine taste of wild beans, sweet spring celery, and duckweed seeds to the village elders. The elders tasted them, only to find their mouths stung and their bellies pained. The crowd laughed and reviled him, and the man was deeply ashamed. You are of the same kind.\"*\n\n**Explanation:** One who wears coarse hemp knows nothing of the warmth of grand halls, sheltered chambers, silk floss, or fox-fur robes; one who praises wild beans, sweet spring celery, and duckweed knows nothing of the richness of fine grains. Cloaked in comfort, they remain unaware of the Dao’s way of clothing all things; seduced by worldly flavors, they fail to know the Dao’s blandness, which is flavorless—so it is with these men.\n\nYang Zhu said: *\"Grand houses, fine clothes, rich flavors, and beautiful women—with these four, what more could one seek? Yet those who possess them and still seek more are of insatiable nature. Such insatiability is the worm that gnaws at yin and yang.\"*\n\n**Explanation:** Grand houses, fine clothes, rich flavors, and beautiful women are all things beyond one’s proper share. To pursue them relentlessly is to be of insatiable nature. Why must one seek beyond these to be deemed insatiable? Mencius considered the eyes’ colors, the ears’ sounds, the nose’s scents, and the limbs’ ease as human nature. The teachings of Liezi sought harmony with nature and contentment in simplicity, despising those who distort their true feelings to chase empty fame. Thus, to possess these four and still seek more is to be the worm that gnaws at yin and yang. Moreover, to speak of having these four is to imply wealth and sufficiency. If one must seek them to possess them, what greater insatiability could there be?\n\nLoyalty is insufficient to secure a ruler’s peace and only endangers the self; righteousness is insufficient to benefit others and only harms one’s life. Peace for superiors does not come from loyalty, and so the name of loyalty fades; benefiting others does not come from righteousness, and so the name of righteousness perishes. When ruler and subject are both at ease, when self and others both profit—this was the Way of antiquity.\n\n**Explanation:** Loyalty dares to confront the ruler’s displeasure; righteousness is resolute in shaping things. Loyalty may overreach in self-discipline, and others will turn against it; righteousness may err in severity, and the unworthy will respond with malice. But to serve a ruler with the Dao is to bear a fine name oneself while the ruler enjoys renown—is this not ruler and subject both at ease? To respond to things with the Dao is to remain without action oneself while the people transform naturally—is this not self and others both profiting? Laozi said: *\"When the great Dao declines, there is benevolence and righteousness; when the state is in chaos, there are loyal ministers.\"* This is the same idea.\n\nMaster Yu said: *\"Abandon fame, and there is no sorrow.\"* Laozi said: *\"Fame is the guest of reality.\"* Yet the careless pursue fame without end. If fame cannot be abandoned, can it not at least be treated as a guest? Now, to have fame is to enjoy honor; to lack fame is to suffer disgrace. Honor brings ease and pleasure; disgrace brings worry and hardship. Worry and hardship violate one’s nature; ease and pleasure accord with it. These are tied to reality. How can fame be abandoned? How can it be treated as a guest? The danger lies in clinging to fame and burdening reality. Clinging to fame and burdening reality will lead to irreparable peril—how could it be merely a matter of ease and pleasure or worry and hardship?\n\n**Explanation:** Master Yu’s abandonment of fame does not mean its absence but its non-attachment. Laozi’s treating fame as a guest does not mean its removal but its non-mastery. Since life exists, so does the self; since the self exists, so do burdens. Where things and self interact, every affair involves fame, and every fame involves reality. Joy and suffering in one’s nature are tied to fame—how could fame be entirely eradicated? The careless, enamored of empty fame, pursue it endlessly and thus lose their grasp on reality. Those who covet the name of benevolence may go so far as to kill themselves; those who covet the name of righteousness may go so far as to destroy their kin. Jie Zitui died for loyalty; Weisheng died for trust—both clung to fame and burdened reality, courting irreparable peril.\n\nThis chapter of Liezi repeatedly expounds the principle of fame and reality. Yet lest scholars mistakenly believe the Dao seeks to eradicate all fame under heaven, it further clarifies: the danger lies in clinging to fame and burdening reality. If one can avoid clinging to fame and burdening reality, this is Master Yu’s abandonment of fame, Zhuangzi’s treating fame as a guest, and the sage’s so-called namelessness. In this lies the fullness of the Way of conducting oneself and responding to things.\n\n**Yang Zhu’s Explanation:** Master Liezi’s classic elucidates the essentials of the great Dao, transmitting the orthodox lineage of the Yellow Emperor, Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Kings Wen and Wu, the Duke of Zhou, and Confucius.",

      "translated_text": "Yang’s doctrine of \"for me\" is a heretical teaching that deludes the people, corroding the Way of the sages more grievously than any other. Thus, later scholars of the sages took the ability to refute Yang and Mo as the mark of a true disciple of the sages. Yet observe how Liezi takes the name *Yu-kou* (Master Yu)—this too signifies his self-assumed duty to safeguard the Way of the former sages. His book repeatedly cites the words of Yang and Mo as instruction, even equating Confucius with Mozi as those whom the world wishes to bring peace and benefit. Here, he further offers the teachings of *Yang Zhu* as a separate chapter. Does the author of *Liezi* truly regard Yang Zhu’s Way as unopposed to the sages and thus fit to instruct the world? Or does he recognize it as a doctrine that obstructs benevolence and righteousness—why then would he adopt its words?\n\nThe intent of *Liezi* may be inferred. Yang’s \"for me\" is a lament for those in the world who, chasing external things, lose themselves, unaware of what abides within. In life, they pursue longevity, fame, rank, and wealth—none of which truly benefit the self. Even in death, they still seek blessings for their descendants. Yet descendants are but the cast-off husks of heaven and earth—what have they to do with me? Thus, men cautiously weigh what they see and hear, cling to right and wrong, are restrained by rewards and punishments, and advance or retreat by the measures of fame and law. Restless and anxious, they spend their lives no different from prisoners in heavy shackles, never awakening to the fact that creation brought me into being for *myself* alone. My life ought to be lived for me, ensuring that the self is not lost—why then torment body and mind to seek what others seek, to suit what others suit, and in doing so, lose what is truly mine?\n\nFrom this, we know that *Liezi* does not wish the world to embrace Yang’s heretical doctrine. Rather, he desires that men not be enslaved by external things, that they know only to preserve the self. If one can avoid losing the self, then governing a state or ordering the world becomes but the overflow of one’s surplus—how magnificent would that be!\n\nNevertheless, Master Liezi’s instruction is subtle. His book clarifies that all beings arise from utmost emptiness, taking *zong-cang-gu* (the storehouse of the ancestral) as its principle, equating all paths to the lost sheep. Thus, he takes the most extreme of Yang Zhu’s heretical teachings, merges them with the Way of the sages, and presents them as one discourse, hoping that scholars will not follow the traces of the sages but seek their minds instead. Therefore, every passage that invokes Yang Zhu’s words conveys nothing but the essence of the supreme Way, even going so far as to equate the Four Sages and the Two Villains as sharing the same ultimate end.\n\nLater readers, upon reaching this point, may well doubt that *Liezi* considers Yao and Shun as truly outside the Way, or that he genuinely aligns with Yang’s heresy. This is the fault of reading the text without grasping its circumstances. Little do they realize that this very chapter is where *Liezi* exerts his utmost effort, forming a continuous thread with Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Kings Wen and Wu, the Duke of Zhou, and Confucius. Confucius said: *\"Is it only the* Spring and Autumn Annals *that understands me? Is it only the* Spring and Autumn Annals *that condemns me?\"* The chapter *Yang Zhu* in *Liezi* is of the same nature.\n\n*Commentary on the* True Classic of Perfect Virtue *concludes, Volume Seventeen.*\n*Commentary on the* True Classic of Perfect Virtue *begins, Volume Eighteen.*",

      "translated_text": "Minister Jiang Yu, an Inner Student of the Hangzhou Prefecture Academy of Song, respectfully presents:\n\n*Explaining the Symbols, First Fascicle*\n\nMaster Liezi studied under Master Huqiu Zilin. Master Huqiu Zilin said: \"If you understand how to hold to what comes after, then we may speak of how to hold to the self.\" Liezi said: \"I wish to hear about holding to what comes after.\" He replied: \"Observe your shadow, and you will know.\"\n\nLiezi turned and beheld his shadow: when his form bent, the shadow curved; when his form straightened, the shadow aligned. Thus, crookedness and straightness follow the form and do not reside in the shadow; bending and extending depend on things and not on me. This is called \"holding to what comes after and thereby abiding in what comes first.\"\n\n*Explanation:* The *Explaining the Symbols* elucidates the sage’s response to the world. The sage’s response to the world arises only after being moved, acts only under compulsion, and rises only when there is no alternative. Taking things as the form and oneself as the shadow, the shadow always follows the form in its crookedness or straightness, just as I always yield to things in bending or extending. When they come, I come with them; when they go, I go with them. What once moved now halts; what once sat now rises. Others all seize what comes first, while I alone take what comes after, as though lacking any fixed principle. Yet by not contending with things, none in the world can contend with me—this is how one abides in what comes first.\n\nMaster Liezi’s teacher was Master Huqiu Zilin. Once, when his disciples paid their respects, he asked: \"What did Master Hu say?\" Here, he recounts Master Hu’s teaching on holding to what comes after. In the *Heavenly Signs*, the sage’s Way proceeds from Heaven to man, hence it is said to be wordless. In the *Explaining the Symbols*, the sage’s Way proceeds from man to Heaven, hence it cannot avoid being spoken. At first, wordlessness proceeding to Heaven is the sage’s original heart; in the end, speech proceeding to man is the sage’s unavoidable necessity.\n\nMoreover, Liezi’s Way of life arises from knowledge and self-attainment—why would he need to study? Yet to leave instruction for all ages and become the teacher of ten thousand generations, he must, from beginning to end, employ the Way of master and disciple in his discourse. This is akin to Confucius, who did not claim sageliness for himself but said, \"I love antiquity and am earnest in seeking it.\"\n\nGuanyin said to Master Liezi: \"Beautiful words produce a beautiful echo; ugly words produce an ugly echo. A tall body casts a long shadow; a short body casts a short shadow. Name is the echo; body is the shadow.\" Thus he said: \"Be cautious in your words, for they will be answered; be cautious in your conduct, for it will be followed.\"\n\n*Explanation:* The *Book of Changes* says: \"Words and actions are the hinge and spring of the noble person. The release of the hinge and spring determines honor or disgrace. Words and actions are how the noble person moves Heaven and Earth—thus the noble person is cautious of them.\" Therefore, the sage sees the outward and knows the inward, observes the past and knows the future—this is the principle by which he attains foreknowledge.\n\n*Explanation:* Outward and inward, past and future—these are one mechanism. People are often blind to the subtlest illumination and only recognize outward and inward, past and future when things have taken shape and their patterns are fixed. Who can see the outward and know the inward, observe the past and know the future? Only the sage who, from the root source, discerns the portents of transformation.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* says: \"The inchworm bends to seek extension. The dragon and snake store their power to preserve themselves.\" The measure lies in oneself; the verification lies in others. If others love me, I must love them; if others hate me, I must hate them. Tang and Wu loved all under Heaven, thus they reigned as kings; Jie and Zhou hated all under Heaven, thus they perished—this is what is verified. When verification and measure are both clear yet not acted upon, it is like leaving without using the door or walking without following the path. Seeking profit thus—is it not difficult?\n\nI have observed that the Divine Farmer possessed the virtue of blazing clarity. Verifying it against the books of Yu, Xia, Shang, and Zhou, and measuring it by the words of exemplary scholars and worthies, I find that those who preserved or ruined, abolished or established, yet did not proceed by this Way—there have been none.\n\n*Explanation:* Before the Great Primal separated, the ten thousand images were a chaotic whole. After the Two Modes divided, each thing found its place. Not even a hair’s breadth could be disordered; not even one or two could be misaligned. Sound moves and echo responds; form arises and shadow follows. What lies in me can be measured; what lies in others can be verified. Following Yao and Shun, the imperial enterprise can be traced; following Tang and Wu, the kingly achievement can be inherited. The Divine Farmer possessed the virtue of blazing clarity—he attained this alone. The books of Yu, Xia, Shang, and Zhou record this alone. The words of exemplary scholars and worthies debate this alone. Even the most sagely of persons, subtle and profoundly penetrating, unfathomably deep—when they emerge to respond to things, there has never been one who did not govern by this Way.\n\nMencius, who claimed to understand words, said: \"If the sages were to arise again, they would surely follow my words.\" His discourse on the Way of the former sages also said: \"If the sages were to arise again, they would not alter my words.\" Regarding the sages who had not yet appeared, he predicted what they would surely do, for they would not go beyond verification and measure.\n\nAs for the saying, \"If others love me, I must love them; if others hate me, I must hate them\"—the sage does not love or hate others based on their love or hatred of him. Rather, if others love me, it must be because I have something worthy of their love; if others hate me, it must be because I have something worthy of their hatred.\n\nYan Hui said: \"Those who ask about the Way do so for the sake of wealth. Now that I have obtained the pearl, I am wealthy—why would I need the Way?\" Master Liezi said: \"Jie and Zhou valued profit and slighted the Way, thus they perished. Fortunately, I have not yet spoken to you of this. A person without righteousness, who eats and nothing more, is like a chicken or dog. Those who forcibly seize food and lock horns, with the stronger prevailing—these are beasts. To be like chickens, dogs, or beasts, yet desire others to honor oneself—this cannot be. If others do not honor oneself, then danger and disgrace will befall one.\"\n\n*Explanation:* Zhuangzi once used the \"mysterious pearl\" to illustrate the Yellow Emperor’s Way.",

      "translated_text": "The pearl, as an object, is perfectly round and luminous—it is the ultimate treasure. Its roundness allows nothing to obstruct it, and its clarity reflects all things without exception. Thus, obtaining the pearl serves as a metaphor for the wealth of the Way. Only those who attain the Way possess all things in abundance, which is what Zhuangzi called \"wealth beyond measure.\" To value profit as wealth leads only to peril and disgrace.\n\nLiezi had mastered archery and sought instruction from Master Guanyin. The master asked: \"Do you know why you hit the mark?\" Liezi replied: \"I do not.\" Guanyin said: \"Then you are not ready.\" Liezi withdrew and practiced for three years before returning to report. Guanyin asked again: \"Do you now know why you hit the mark?\" Liezi answered: \"I do.\" Guanyin said: \"Now it is acceptable. Hold fast to this and do not lose it. This principle applies not only to archery but to governing a state and cultivating oneself.\" Thus, the sage does not examine whether things endure or perish but investigates the reasons behind them.\n\n*Explanation:* An archer who hits the target without prior intent cannot be called a skilled archer, for he does not understand why he succeeded. Once he grasps the reason, his success lies within himself, and even the skill of Gan Ying or Fei Wei becomes attainable. Governing a state and cultivating oneself follow the same principle. By discerning the causes of survival and ruin, one can wield the Way to navigate the times, ensuring enduring existence. If the nature of survival and ruin has already manifested, even scrutiny will be of no avail.\n\nLiezi said: \"Those whose vitality is abundant grow arrogant, and those whose strength is abundant grow reckless—such people cannot be spoken to of the Way. Thus, one does not discuss the Way with the young and vigorous, let alone practice it.\"\n\n*Explanation:* Those whose vitality is abundant grow arrogant, and those whose strength is in full bloom are in their prime—a time when external things assail them and their virtue naturally declines. How could they be spoken to of the Way? By the time their hair turns gray, their desires soften and their bodies begin to rest, making them fit to hear of the Way and practice it. Yet this speaks only of those who are subject to the great transformations of nature. There are also those who follow the great transformations without being swept along by them, who never lose the heart of an infant. Though strong, they are not arrogant; though aged, they do not decline. In speaking of the Way, they are never at a loss.\n\nThus, those who act recklessly will find no one to guide them. Without guidance, they become isolated and lack support. The wise entrust matters to others, so even in old age they do not decline, and even when their wisdom is exhausted, they do not fall into chaos.\n\nTherefore, the difficulty in governing a state lies in recognizing the worthy, not in considering oneself wise.\n\n*Explanation:* Those who do not take on tasks but exhaust their strength in labor will not decline with age. Those who do not hoard wisdom but employ the counsel of the wise will not fall into chaos when their own wisdom is spent. Even with the intelligence of Yao and Shun, Yao worried over not obtaining Shun, and Shun worried over not obtaining Yu and Gaoyao. The difficulty of governing a state lies solely in this—how can one rely on the conduct of self-proclaimed wisdom?\n\nA man of Song crafted a mulberry leaf out of jade for his lord, taking three years to complete it. Its edges, veins, and fine details were so lifelike that when mixed with real mulberry leaves, it could not be distinguished. As a result, this man lived off his craft in the state of Song.\n\nWhen Liezi heard of this, he said: \"If heaven and earth took three years to produce a single leaf, few things would have leaves at all.\" Thus, the sage relies on the transformative power of the Way, not on cleverness or skill.\n\n*Explanation:* Carving jade into a mulberry leaf so indistinguishable from real leaves demonstrates how human skill can rival the workings of creation. Yet the jade carver took three years to complete one leaf, while the transformations of nature—with yang qi circulating subtly through heaven and earth—bring forth the flourishing and withering of all things, shaping countless forms without being called clever. Even the skill of the Song artisan only secured his livelihood in one state—how much less for those whose skill does not match his? Thus, the sage relies on the transformative power of the Way, not on cleverness or skill.\n\nLiezi was impoverished, his appearance bearing the marks of hunger. A visitor mentioned this to Ziyang, the ruler of Zheng, saying: \"Lie Yukou is a man of the Way. That he lives in your state in such poverty—does this not suggest you do not value scholars?\" Ziyang immediately ordered an official to send grain to Liezi. Liezi went out to meet the messenger, bowed twice, and declined the gift. The messenger departed.",

      "translated_text": "When Liezi returned home, his wife gazed at him and, striking her breast, said: \"I have heard that the wives and children of those who possess the Way all enjoy ease and happiness. Yet you bear the marks of hunger. The ruler passed by and sent you food, but you refused it—is this not fate?\"\n\nLiezi laughed and replied: \"The ruler does not know me personally. He sent me grain only because of another’s words, and if he were to punish me, it would also be on account of another’s words. This is why I did not accept it.\" Later, the people indeed rose in rebellion and killed Ziyang.\n\n**Explanation:** The sage is never careless in accepting or refusing. If something does not accord with the Way, he would rather die than accept it—how much less would he do so for the sake of his wife’s offerings? By navigating the world in this manner, he avoided disaster.\n\nThe Lu family of the Shi clan had two sons. One loved learning, the other loved warfare. The one who loved learning offered his arts to the Marquis of Qi, who accepted him and made him tutor to the noble scions. The one who loved warfare went to Chu and presented his methods to the King of Chu, who was pleased and appointed him military commander. Their salaries enriched their household, and their ranks honored their kin.\n\nThe neighboring Meng family had two sons as well, who pursued the same studies, yet suffered from poverty. Envying the Shi family’s prosperity, they sought advice on how to advance. The two Shi sons truthfully told them what they had done.\n\nOne of the Meng sons went to Qin and offered his arts to the King of Qin. The king said: \"Nowadays, the feudal lords contend with force, and all they concern themselves with are soldiers and provisions. If I were to govern my state with benevolence and righteousness, it would be the path to ruin.\" He then castrated the man and banished him.\n\nThe other Meng son went to Wei and presented his methods to the Marquis of Wei. The marquis said: \"I rule a weak state, hemmed in between great powers. I serve the great states and soothe the small ones—this is the way to seek security. If I were to rely on military power, destruction would soon follow. If I let you return unharmed, you would go to another state and become a grave threat to me.\" He then had the man’s feet cut off and sent him back to Lu.\n\nUpon their return, the Meng father and sons beat their breasts and reproached the Shi family. The Shi father said: \"Those who seize the moment prosper; those who miss it perish. Your path was the same as ours, yet your results differ—this is because you missed the moment, not because your conduct was flawed. Moreover, in the world, principles have no constant right, and affairs no constant wrong. What was once used may now be discarded; what is now discarded may later be used. This matter of use and disuse has no fixed right or wrong. Seizing opportunities and adapting to circumstances—this depends on wisdom. If wisdom is insufficient, even if one were as learned as Confucius or as skilled as Lü Shang, where could one go and not meet with failure?\"\n\nThe Meng father and sons relaxed their expressions, free of resentment, and said: \"We understand. Say no more.\"\n\n**Explanation:** The Guo clan of Qi and the Xiang clan of Song differed in wealth, for the Xiang clan did not grasp the Guo clan’s way. Beigongzi and Ximenzi met with different fortunes in their undertakings, for their virtue and fate may have differed in depth. As for the Shi and Meng families of Lu, their pursuits were the same—unlike the Guo and Xiang clans, who followed different paths, or Beigongzi and Ximenzi, whose virtue and fate may have differed. Qi inherited the customs of the Grand Duke and continued with the governance of Guan and Yan; Wei was enfeoffed by Kangshu and Duke Wu, who maintained its administration, so Wei abounded in noble men. Thus, the states of Qi and Wei concerned themselves only with benevolence and righteousness. Chu, dwelling among the barbarians, had King Wu who once wished to display his worn armor to observe the governance of the Central States, and King Zhuang who reviewed his troops at the Luo suburbs to inquire about the Zhou tripods. From Duke Xiao of Qin onward, Qin devoured the six states. The kings of Qin and Chu concerned themselves only with soldiers and provisions. The Shi family applied the methods the Meng family had used in Wei to Chu, and presented the techniques the Meng family had used in Qin to Qi, so they met with success everywhere. Had the Meng family likewise applied the methods used in Wei to Qin and the techniques used in Qin to Wei, they would have achieved the same results as the Shi family. Why did they reverse their methods? Thus, the Shi family attributed their failure to a lack of timely wisdom, and the Meng family, too, released their resentment.\n\nThe virtue of governing with benevolence and righteousness is profound, so those who offended were punished severely. The art of military power in a strong state is shallow, so the punishment stopped at amputation. Nevertheless, seizing opportunities and adapting to circumstances depend on wisdom. Yet in the world, there are matters beyond the reach of wisdom—thus, the differing fortunes of the two families were also a matter of fate. Yet when Liezi recounted their words, it was because the *Shuofu* does not depart from the scrutiny of forms and names. If one were to attribute all success and failure to fate, scholars would drift toward the inaction of clods and dust, which is not the Way. Therefore, in this case, he did not dismiss the wisdom of seizing the moment.\n\nDuke Wen of Jin went out to a meeting, intending to attack Wei. Gongzi Chu looked up to the sky and laughed. The duke asked why he laughed. He replied: \"I laugh at a neighbor who was escorting his wife to her parents’ home. Along the way, he saw a woman picking mulberry leaves, was pleased, and spoke with her. Yet when he glanced back at his wife, someone was beckoning to her as well. I secretly laughed at this.\"\n\nThe duke understood his meaning and called off the attack. He turned the army back, but before they arrived, someone had already raided their northern border.\n\n**Explanation:** People’s thoughts are not far apart. What I desire, others desire; what I know, others know. To pursue one’s own ambitions without considering others’ feelings is delusion.\n\nThe state of Jin suffered from bandits. There was a man named Xi Yong who could recognize bandits by their appearance, discerning their intentions from their eyebrows and eyelashes. The Marquis of Jin sent him to identify bandits, and he did not miss a single one among hundreds. The marquis was overjoyed and told Zhao Wenzi: \"I have found one man, and all the bandits in the state are as good as gone. Why would I need more?\"",

      "translated_text": "Wenzi said: \"Relying on spies and scrutiny to catch bandits, Your Lordship will never eradicate them. Moreover, Xi Yong will not meet a good end.\"\n\nSoon after, the bandits plotted among themselves: \"The one who has us cornered is Xi Yong.\" They then joined forces to ambush and kill him.\n\nWhen the Marquis of Jin heard this, he was greatly alarmed. He immediately summoned Wenzi and told him: \"Just as you predicted, Xi Yong is dead. But what method should we use to capture the bandits?\"\n\nWenzi replied: \"There is a saying in the Zhou proverbs: 'He who sees the fish in the abyss brings misfortune; he who predicts hidden things invites calamity.' If Your Lordship wishes to eliminate bandits, nothing is better than elevating the worthy and entrusting them with governance, so that instruction is clear above and transformation flows below. When the people possess a sense of shame, what need is there for bandits?\"\n\nThereupon, the marquis appointed Sui Hui to administer the government, and the bandits fled to Qin.\n\n**Explanation:** Those who rely on spies and scrutiny catch bandits only after the crime is committed, while those who clarify instruction and transformation prevent banditry before it arises. Once a man has become a bandit, where is the virtue in that? Thus, Xi Yong’s scrutiny of bandits led to his untimely death. But when transformation is enacted and the people come to know shame, as when Sui Hui was entrusted with governance, the bandits fled to Qin. Yet driving bandits away only to have them flee to Qin is like those who control floods by making a neighboring state their drainage ditch.\n\nTo govern the world by the Dao is to have the people dwell without knowing what they do, move without knowing where they go, harmonized in desirelessness—this is called \"pristine simplicity.\" When covetous ambition does not arise, who would become a bandit? The state of Jin relied on spies and scrutiny, so I addressed its error and guided it toward governance, but I did not proceed to expound the fullness of the Dao.\n\nConfucius, returning from Wei to Lu, halted his carriage by a bridge over the river to observe. There was a waterfall thirty *ren* high, its swirling currents flowing ninety *li*, where fish and turtles could not swim, and *yuan* and *tuo* could not dwell. Yet a man was about to ford it. Confucius sent someone along the bank to stop him, saying: \"This waterfall is thirty *ren* high, its currents swirl for ninety *li*, where fish and turtles cannot swim, and *yuan* and *tuo* cannot dwell. Surely it is too perilous to cross?\"\n\nThe man paid no heed, waded in, and emerged safely. Confucius asked him: \"Is this skill? Or do you possess some technique? How were you able to enter and exit?\"\n\nThe man replied: \"When I first entered, I began with loyalty and trust. When I exited, I followed with loyalty and trust. Loyalty and trust placed my body amidst the waves, and I dared not act for private ends. That is how I was able to enter and emerge again.\"\n\nConfucius said to his disciples: \"Remember this, all of you. If even water can be crossed by entrusting oneself to loyalty and trust, how much more so with people?\"\n\n**Explanation:** Loyalty follows the Dao of water without self-interest; trust rests in water without doubt. Thus, entering and exiting the water becomes something one does without knowing how—this is how he was able to enter and emerge again. The *Huangdi* chapter once spoke of this, attributing it to following the principles of nature and destiny; here, it is called loyalty and trust. \"Placing one’s body amidst the waves\" means that loyalty and trust are the very principles of nature and destiny. The previous chapter clarified the spontaneity of the imperial Dao, hence it spoke of \"nature and destiny.\" This chapter demonstrates the correspondence of natural principles, hence it speaks of \"loyalty and trust.\" Confucius once told Zizhang that loyalty and trust could be practiced even in the lands of the Man and Mo barbarians. His teachings on loyalty and trust are manifold, so here he bids his disciples to remember them.\n\n*Explication of the Perfect Dao of Pristine Emptiness and Ultimate Virtue*, Scroll 18—concluded.\n*Explication of the Perfect Dao of Pristine Emptiness and Ultimate Virtue*, Scroll 19.",

      "translated_text": "**Submitted by Jiang Yu, Inner College Student of Hangzhou Prefecture, Song Dynasty, on the \"Explanation of Correspondences\" Section**\n\nBai Gong asked Confucius, \"Can one engage in subtle discourse with others?\"\nConfucius did not respond.\n\nBai Gong asked again, \"If a stone is cast into water, what then?\"\nConfucius said, \"A skilled diver from Wu could retrieve it.\"\nBai Gong said, \"If water is poured into water, what then?\"\nConfucius replied, \"When the waters of the Zi and Meng rivers merge, Yi Ya could distinguish them by taste.\"\n\nBai Gong said, \"Is it truly impossible to engage in subtle discourse with others?\"\nConfucius said, \"Why would it be impossible? Only one who knows the nature of words can do so. For one who knows the nature of words does not speak with words. Those who contend for fish get drenched; those who chase beasts run swiftly—not because they delight in it. Thus, the most profound words transcend speech, and the highest action is non-action. What shallow minds contend over is but trifling.\"\n\nBai Gong, unable to bear it, later died in the bathhouse.\n\n*Explication:*\nWhat sound cannot encompass, the mind cannot grasp. If it can be spoken, it can be known. I, possessing knowledge, can speak; they, hearing the words, can understand. Once form and voice manifest—even if like the merging of the Zi and Meng rivers, difficult to distinguish—Yi Ya could discern them by taste. Thus, when Bai Gong first inquired about subtle discourse, Confucius, already knowing his intent, did not respond. Such is the impossibility of concealing words.\n\nYet one who speaks without intent speaks as if not speaking; one who speaks with intent, though seeking subtlety, only amplifies it. Thus, speech is not inherently unsuited to subtlety—seeking subtlety itself precludes it. Where there are words, there is action; where there is action, there is contention. I bring resentment; they return harm—like those who contend for fish or chase beasts, drenched and running, compelled by circumstance.\n\nBut one who knows the nature of words does not speak with words. Without words, there is no action. Compared to the contentions of the shallow-minded, it is as trivial as the clash of insects. Is this not trifling?\n\nThough Bai Gong heard Confucius’ words, he ultimately died in the bathhouse—was it not because, bound by his father’s enmity, he had no choice?\n\n---\n\nZhao Xiangzi sent Xin Gan Muzi to attack the Di, defeating them and capturing the cities of Zuoren and Zhongren. A messenger was dispatched to report the victory. Xiangzi was eating but wore a troubled expression. His attendants said, \"Two cities captured in a single day—this is cause for joy. Why does my lord appear troubled?\"\n\nXiangzi said, \"The greatness of rivers and seas lasts no more than three days; violent winds and torrential rains do not endure past morning; the midday sun does not linger. Now, the virtue and conduct of the Zhao house have not been cultivated over time. Two cities captured in a day—will ruin not soon befall us?\"\n\nConfucius heard of this and said, \"The Zhao house will flourish. For worry is the means to flourishing, and joy is the path to ruin. Victory is not the difficult part—maintaining it is. A worthy ruler sustains victory thus, and his blessings extend to later generations. Qi, Chu, Wu, and Yue all once triumphed, yet ultimately perished, for they did not grasp how to maintain victory. Only a ruler of the Dao can sustain it.\"\n\nConfucius’ strength was such that he could force open the gate of a state’s capital, yet he refused to be known for his power. Mozi devised defensive strategies, and Gongshu Ban conceded, yet he refused to be known for his military skill. Thus, one who excels at maintaining victory turns strength into weakness.\n\n*Explication:*\nAttacking the weak with one’s strength, opposing the few with one’s multitude, assaulting the guilty while oneself blameless—this is the way of absolute security. Yet fullness must decline, completion must decay, and prosperity must wane—this is the inevitable principle. Thus, victory is not difficult; maintaining it is.\n\nSpeaking of victory, Qi, Chu, Wu, and Yue all once triumphed. Speaking of maintenance, only a ruler like the startled teal can be deemed capable. Why? Victory relies on strength; maintenance relies on weakness. When armies clash, though strength prevails, it is not strength that makes one strong—rather, the most yielding Dao directs one’s strength. Victorious at the enemy’s gates, one must preserve with weakness. It is not that weakness preserves strength, but that the most yielding Dao, accumulated, becomes firm.\n\nThus, *Laozi* says: \"In life, humans are supple and weak; in death, they are rigid and strong. In life, plants are supple and weak; in death, they are withered and brittle. Thus, those who rely on military strength do not prevail; trees that are strong are felled.\" Only one who embodies the Dao comprehends the principles of heaven and earth’s waxing and waning, fullness and emptiness. Though immensely strong, he refuses to be known for his power; though capable of subduing others, he refuses to be known for his military skill. He takes softness, weakness, humility, and lowliness as his outward form, always abiding in a place of non-contention. Thus, none in the world can contend with him—not only can none contend, but all will gladly support him without resentment. What greater way is there to maintain victory? This is how Confucius knew the Zhao house would flourish.\n\n---\n\nIn Song, there was a man devoted to practicing benevolence and righteousness, unwavering for three generations. His family’s black ox unexpectedly bore a white calf, so he asked Confucius about it. Confucius said, \"This is an auspicious omen; offer it to the Supreme Emperor.\"\n\nA year later, the man’s father unexpectedly went blind, and the ox again bore a white calf. The father again instructed his son to ask Confucius. The son said, \"Last time, you asked and lost your sight—why ask again?\"\n\nThe father said, \"The words of a sage first oppose, then align. The matter is not yet resolved—let us ask again.\"\n\nThe son again asked Confucius. Confucius said, \"It is auspicious,\" and again instructed him to perform the sacrifice. The son returned and relayed the message. The father said, \"Follow Confucius’ words.\"\n\nA year later, the son unexpectedly went blind. Later, when Chu attacked Song and besieged its capital, the people exchanged their children to eat and broke their bones for fuel. The able-bodied climbed the walls to fight, and more than half died.

      "translated_text": "When the siege was lifted, both father and son’s afflictions were restored. The commentary states: A black ox bearing a white calf is the natural order of things—only when it occurs without cause does Heaven perhaps intend some portent. The ox is the sacrificial beast for Heaven and Earth, so its birth without cause is an auspicious omen for great matters. The ox is a creature of water, black is the color of water, and white is the color of metal; metal generates water, so black giving birth to white reverses its origin, making its generation inexhaustible. This is how those who practice benevolence and righteousness without cease rely on such signs to escape death in Chu’s siege. Moreover, black is obscure while white is manifest—this too resembles the pattern of first losing sight and then regaining it. The words of sages are all explanations that exhaust principle and fulfill nature, thus they never fail to align. When they appear to oppose, it is not that they do not align, but that the matter has not yet reached its conclusion. How can later readers of the sages’ works, failing to grasp their intent, hastily apply them to affairs and seek immediate results?\n\nConsider this case: a household’s black ox bore a white calf twice without cause, and Confucius deemed it auspicious, instructing them to offer sacrifice to the Supreme Emperor. Such extraordinary omens should have brought extraordinary blessings. Yet it only spared father and son from the duty of scaling the walls—from a Daoist perspective, the distinction between fortune and misfortune differs in minor wisdom, so its arrival also varies in weight according to the times. During the decline of Zhou, the six states’ sole concern was military power. Even Confucius, born in that era, nearly could not escape the hardships of Chen and Cai. Thus, for the people of Song to avoid death in battle, unless they had practiced benevolence and righteousness without cease for three generations and thereby moved Heaven and Earth, they could not easily have obtained such a fate.\n\nIn Song there was a man called Orchid Child who offered his skills to Duke Yuan of Song. The duke summoned him to perform. He bound two rods twice his height to his shins, ran swiftly while keeping pace, and juggled seven swords, tossing them in succession so that five were always in the air. The lord was greatly astonished and immediately bestowed gold and silk. Another Orchid Child, skilled in swallow-play, heard of this and also sought an audience with the duke. The duke flew into a rage: \"Formerly, a man with extraordinary skills sought my favor, but his skills were of no use—it just so happened I was in high spirits, so I rewarded him with gold and silk. He must have heard of this and come seeking a similar reward. Seize and execute him!\" A month later, he was released.",

      "translated_text": "A commentary states: The marvel of a skill may not differ, yet rewards and punishments vary—external things cannot be relied upon. Thus, the noble person focuses only on what lies within themselves.\n\nDuke Mu of Qin said to Bo Le, \"You are advanced in years. Do you have among your kin someone who can be sent to seek horses?\"\n\nBo Le replied, \"A fine horse can be discerned by its form, appearance, sinews, and bones. But the horse of all under heaven—vanishing as if extinguished, lost as if gone, like this one—leaves no dust in its wake, outstripping all bounds. My sons are all of lesser talent; they may be taught to recognize fine horses, but not the horse of all under heaven. I have one with whom I once shared a roof while gathering firewood and vegetables—Jiu Fang Gao. In judging horses, he is no inferior to me. I beg you to meet him.\"\n\nDuke Mu received him and sent him to seek a horse. After three months, he returned and reported, \"I have found one. It is in Shaqiu.\"\n\nThe duke asked, \"What kind of horse is it?\"\n\nHe replied, \"A yellow mare.\"\n\nThe duke sent someone to fetch it, but it was a black stallion. Displeased, Duke Mu summoned Bo Le and said, \"You have failed. The one you sent to seek a horse cannot even distinguish color or sex—how could he know a horse?\"\n\nBo Le sighed deeply and said, \"Has it truly come to this? This is why he surpasses me ten thousandfold without measure. In Jiu Fang Gao’s observation, it is the workings of heaven. He grasps the essence and forgets the coarse; he sees within and disregards the outer. He perceives what is to be seen and does not see what is not; he gazes upon what is to be gazed upon and overlooks what is not. In his judgment of horses, there is something more precious than the horse itself.\"\n\nWhen the horse arrived, it was indeed the horse of all under heaven.\n\nA commentary states: Judging horses is but the least of skills. Even Bo Le, with all his mastery, could not teach it to his sons, nor could his sons receive it from him. Why? What can be transmitted does not go beyond rules, compasses, and measuring cords; what can be judged does not go beyond form, appearance, sinews, and bones. As for the horse of all under heaven—it vanishes as if concealed between existence and nonexistence, lost as if dwelling in the indistinct and vague. It transcends all bounds, leaving no trace. Unless one disregards its outward traits, observes its heavenly workings, attains it inwardly in the heart, and matches it outwardly in the horse’s body, one may seek the state’s fine horses but never obtain the horse of all under heaven.\n\nThus, when Jiu Fang Gao sought the horse, though it was a black stallion, he called it a yellow mare. Did Jiu Fang Gao truly not know its color or sex? He took it as a mare because what he valued was its masculine power; what he held to was its feminine essence. He called it yellow because what was black was its surface; what he preserved was its inner truth. This is what is meant by seeing what others do not see, gazing upon what others do not gaze upon—thus, there is something more precious than the horse itself. For this reason, Duke Mu, upon hearing his words, thought him a failure. Yet Bo Le, though he recognized this, knew he surpassed him ten thousandfold without measure. When the horse arrived, it was indeed the horse of all under heaven.\n\nFor in Jiu Fang Gao’s judgment of horses, he silently grasped the marvel of the unspoken. In Bo Le’s understanding of Jiu Fang Gao, he was in perfect accord without a word. Without Jiu Fang Gao, the horse could not have been found; without Bo Le, Jiu Fang Gao could not have been known. The horse of Shaqiu had never been absent, yet Bo Le and Jiu Fang Gao do not appear in every generation. Even if the horse of all under heaven exists, it may not be recognized as a fine steed, while mediocre and sluggish horses may still be yoked together beneath the carriage. Alas! The horse of all under heaven is so difficult to know—how much more so the scholars of the world who wander beyond the realm of the knowable?\n\nXu Wugui met Marquis Wu of Wei and spoke to him of judging horses. This is why the marquis was greatly pleased and laughed.\n\nKing Zhuang of Chu asked Zhan He, \"How should one govern the state?\"\n\nZhan He replied, \"I am enlightened in governing the self but not in governing the state.\"\n\nKing Zhuang said, \"I have been entrusted with the ancestral temples and the altars of the state. I wish to learn how to preserve them.\"\n\nZhan He replied, \"I have never heard of a self well-governed yet a state in chaos, nor have I heard of a self in chaos yet a state well-governed. Thus, the root lies in the self. I dare not answer with what is but a branch.\"\n\nThe king said, \"Well said.\"\n\nA commentary states: The Yellow Emperor asked Guangchengzi, \"I wish to gather the essence of heaven and earth to aid the five grains and nourish the people. I also wish to regulate yin and yang to bring fulfillment to all living things.\"\n\nGuangchengzi said, \"With a heart as restless as a meddler’s, how could you be worthy of speaking of the supreme Dao?\" Later, when the Yellow Emperor returned to entreat him, asking how to govern the self to attain longevity, Guangchengzi approved of his question and spoke to him of the supreme Dao.\n\nFor when the root is secured, the branches need not be feared. Thus, when King Zhuang asked Zhan He about governing the state, Zhan He answered with governing the self.\n\nThe elder of Huqiu said to Sunshu Ao, \"There are three things that incur resentment—do you know them?\"\n\nSunshu Ao asked, \"What are they?\"\n\nHe replied, \"Those with high rank are envied; those with great office are resented by their lord; those with generous emoluments are beset by grievances.\"\n\nSunshu Ao said, \"The higher my rank, the more I humble my aspirations; the greater my office, the smaller I make my heart; the more generous my emoluments, the more I extend my benefactions.\"",

He must have heard of this and come seeking a similar reward. Seize and execute him!\" A month later, he was released.",

      "translated_text": "Can this avert the three resentments? The explanation is as follows:\n\nWhen rank is high, others envy it—because it overshadows them. When office is great, the lord resents it—because it encroaches upon him. When emoluments are generous, grievances follow—because it implies hoarding.\n\nYet if high rank is met with humble aspirations, none perceive its loftiness; if great office is held with a small heart, the lord does not嫌 its magnitude; if generous emoluments are matched with broad benefactions, none begrudge their abundance.

      "translated_text": "To this day, his holding has not been lost.\n\nExplanation: To dwell where the multitude shuns is to avoid contention; only by avoiding contention can one escape blame, and thus indeed endure long. Now, Sunshu Ao—his rank and emoluments were sufficient to honor his person and keep resentment at bay, his benefits and blessings extended to his descendants, enabling them to hold their land in perpetuity. Was this by some other means? No, it was simply that amid wealth and nobility, he discerned the principle of waxing and waning, fullness and emptiness, ensuring that loftiness did not reach peril, that plenitude did not overflow. This is what is meant by \"though rich and noble, one does not use abundance to harm oneself.\"\n\nAs for Yan He, who truly despised wealth and nobility, his case surpasses even this.\n\nNiu Que was a great Confucian of Shangdang. Descending to Handan, he encountered bandits in the thickets of Ou Sha, who took all his clothing and carriage. Niu walked away, gazing back with a cheerful countenance, free of sorrow or regret. The bandits pursued and asked the reason. He replied: \"The noble man does not harm what he nurtures by clinging to what nurtures him.\" The bandits exclaimed: \"Ah! How worthy he is!\" Then they conferred among themselves: \"With his worthiness, if he goes to see the Lord of Zhao and speaks of us, he will surely bring trouble upon us. Better to kill him.\" So they pursued and slew him.\n\nWhen the people of Yan heard of this, they gathered their clans and warned one another: \"If you encounter bandits, do not be like Niu Que of Shangdang.\" All took heed. Soon after, Niu Que’s younger brother traveled to Qin. At the pass, he too encountered bandits. Remembering his brother’s warning, he struggled fiercely with the bandits. When this proved futile, he pursued them, pleading humbly for his belongings. The bandits grew enraged: \"We spared your life—how generous!—yet you pursue us without end, leaving tracks for all to see. Once a bandit, where is the room for mercy?\" They killed him and, in the process, slew four or five of his companions as well.",

      "translated_text": "The Explanation states: Niu Que, though truly capable of non-attachment, was slain for it; the younger brother of the Yan man, recalling his brother’s warning and feigning reluctance, brought disaster upon himself. Though one may say that shifts between safety and peril arise from unseen causes, in essence, the actions of these two men were excessive and thus invited such outcomes.\n\nWhy so? When Niu Que encountered the bandits, his joyful demeanor, free of distress or reluctance, would have sufficed. Yet when they pursued him to question his motives, he declared, *\"The noble man does not harm what he nurtures through what he nurtures,\"* thereby revealing his own traces. The one who recalled his brother’s warning fought fiercely but failed—he might have stopped there. Instead, he pursued them with humble pleas for his belongings, thus revealing *their* traces. Once both their traces were exposed, the bandits feared retaliation, which is why these two men were killed.\n\nYet when *his* traces were evident, the harm was distant, and so only Niu Que perished. When *their* traces were evident, the harm was near, and thus four or five of his companions were slain as well.\n\nThe Yu clan was a wealthy family of Liang. Their household overflowed with abundance, their wealth and silk beyond measure, their treasures beyond estimation. They ascended a high tower overlooking the main road, where they set up music and wine, gambling on the upper floor. As their retinue of swordsmen passed below, one of the gamblers loosed an arrow, striking the bright jade target squarely. Turning to grasp a pair of fish-shaped tokens in laughter, a kite suddenly dropped a rotten rat, hitting the mark. The swordsmen conferred among themselves: *\"The Yu clan has long enjoyed wealth and pleasure, yet they have always held others in contempt. Though we have not provoked them, they now insult us with a rotten rat. If we do not avenge this, we shall have no standing in the world.\"* They vowed as one: *\"Let us unite in purpose, lead our followers, and annihilate their household to set an example.\"* All agreed.\n\nOn the appointed night, they gathered their forces and weapons, launching an assault on the Yu clan and utterly destroying their household.\n\nThe Explanation states: The Way of excess is what Heaven diminishes, Earth transforms, spirits harm, and humanity despises. Only the sage perceives the shifts in all things, thus avoiding excess to preserve life, eschewing extravagance to curb indulgence, and rejecting arrogance to prevent ruin, dwelling only within proper bounds. The Yu clan’s wealth had already accumulated resentment through their lack of benevolence, yet they further ascended a high tower to provoke the gaze of spirits, stood over the main road to offend the disdain of the masses, set up music and wine, and indulged in gambling, giving free rein to their dissipation. How could this endure? Thus, though they harbored ambitions to dominate others, their downfall arose from a kite dropping a rotten rat.\n\nDid the kite, having seized the rotten rat, deliberately cast it down? The travelers on the road were many—why did it strike precisely upon the swordsmen? Was it not that their arrogance and extravagance were despised by gods and men alike, and some unseen force caused it to fall thus, inciting the swordsmen’s wrath?\n\nIn the East there was a man named Yuan Jingmu. While traveling, he collapsed from hunger on the road. A bandit from Hufu named Qiu saw him and offered a gourd of food to feed him. After Yuan Jingmu ate three mouthfuls, his vision returned. He asked, *\"Who are you?\"* The other replied, *\"I am Qiu of Hufu.\"* Yuan Jingmu exclaimed, *\"Ah! Are you not a bandit? Why do you feed me? I will not eat a bandit’s food!\"* Pressing his hands to the ground, he retched violently but could not expel it. Choking, he collapsed and died.\n\nThe man from Hufu was indeed a bandit, but the food was not stolen. To reject it because the giver was a bandit, deeming the food itself tainted, was to lose something precious.\n\nThe Explanation states: When he could not yet see, he accepted the food; once he had eaten and regained his sight, his deluded heart led him to perceive the food as stolen. He died for it without hesitation. From this, we know that the knowledge of heart and eye often brings little benefit to the self but much harm.\n\nHe was called Yuan Jingmu because his eyes could distinguish clearly. *The Zhuangzi* says: *\"No thief is greater than virtue when the heart has eyes.\"* *The Laozi* says: *\"The sage acts for the belly, not for the eyes.\"* Could this be the reason?\n\nZhu Lishu served Duke Ao of Ju.

When Duke Ao of Ju faced peril, Zhu Lishu parted from his friend and went to die for him. His friend said: \"You left because you believed the duke did not appreciate you. Now you go to die for him—this makes no distinction between appreciation and lack of it.\" Zhu Lishu replied: \"Not so. I left because I believed he did not appreciate me. Now, by dying for him, I prove he truly did not. I will die to shame those rulers of later generations who fail to recognize their ministers.

Human knowledge arises from deluded perception. Taking the body as the self, one values and cherishes it, seeking not to die. Thus, one worries over things that may harm the self, desiring to know all things without exception. Yet once knowledge exists, it inwardly deludes the mind, and resentment accumulates within, leading one to forget the body without realizing it. At first, one seeks knowledge to cherish the body, but in the end, knowledge turns to harm it. Thus, it is clear that knowing is no better than not knowing.\n\nFor the noble person, death may be as light as a goose feather or as weighty as Mount Tai. To sacrifice oneself to manifest virtue is to treat death as light; to resent and forget oneself—what benefit does it bring? Therefore, what the sage values lies in knowing what one does not know, and what the sage deems harmful lies in not knowing what one knows. Yang Zhu said: \"Benefit given brings true reward; virtue extended invites harm.\" What arises within finds response without—this is the law. Thus, the worthy are cautious in what they put forth.\n\nThe Explanation states: Observing Yuan Jingmu and Zhu Lishu, one sees that resentment extended invites harm—how could the worthy act thus?\n\n*Explication of the Perfect Dao and Virtue, Scroll Nineteen* concludes.\n*Explication of the Perfect Dao and Virtue, Scroll Twenty* begins.",

      "translated_text": "A student of the Inner College of Hangzhou Prefecture in Song, your subject Jiang Yu respectfully presents *Explaining the Symbols, Part Three*:\n\nYangzi’s neighbor lost a sheep. Having already led his own kinsmen in pursuit, he further requested Yangzi’s servants to join the chase. Yangzi said: “Hmm! To lose one sheep—why so many pursuers?” The neighbor replied: “There are many branching paths.” Upon their return, Yangzi asked: “Did you recover the sheep?” The neighbor said: “It is lost.” Yangzi asked: “How was it lost?” The neighbor said: “Among the branching paths there were further branches. I did not know which way to go, so I turned back.”\n\nYangzi’s countenance fell into sorrow, and for a long while he did not speak; for the rest of the day, he did not smile. His disciples found this strange and asked: “The sheep is a lowly beast, and moreover not yours—why has this so diminished your words and laughter?” Yangzi did not answer, and his disciples could not fathom his intent.\n\nDisciple Meng Sunyang went out and told this to Xin Duzi. Another day, Xin Duzi entered together with Meng Sunyang and asked: “Formerly there were three brothers who traveled between Qi and Lu, studying under the same master and learning the Way of benevolence and righteousness before returning home. Their father asked: ‘What is the Way of benevolence and righteousness like?’ The eldest said: ‘Benevolence and righteousness make me cherish my life and only then seek fame.’ The second said: ‘Benevolence and righteousness make me sacrifice my life to achieve fame.’ The youngest said: ‘Benevolence and righteousness make me preserve both life and fame.’ These three methods are opposed, yet all derive from the Ru—who is right and who is wrong?”\n\nYangzi said: “There was a man who lived by the river. Skilled in water, bold in swimming, he plied a boat to ferry passengers and thus provided for his hundred dependents. Those who packed provisions to study from him formed a multitude, yet nearly half drowned. They originally studied swimming, not drowning—yet the benefit and harm turned out thus. If you were to judge, who is right and who is wrong?”\n\nXin Duzi silently departed. Meng Sunyang reproached him: “Why did you ask such a roundabout question, and why did the Master answer so obliquely? My confusion has only deepened.” Xin Duzi said: “The Great Way loses the sheep through many branching paths; the learner loses life through many methods. Though the root of learning is not different, though the root is not divided, the branches diverge thus. Only by returning to unity and reverting to the One can loss and gain be determined. You have long stood at the Master’s gate, studied the Master’s Way, yet do not grasp the Master’s circumstances—how lamentable!”\n\nThe Explanation states: The *Book of Changes* says: “What does the world ponder, what does it deliberate? The world converges on the same destination by different paths, attains unity through a hundred deliberations.” What does the world ponder, what does it deliberate? It ponders so as to have a destination. If different paths lead to the same destination, why deliberate to attain it? If a hundred deliberations yield one governance, why deliberate at all? It is like those who set out for Yan driving north, or those bound for Yue taking the southern road. Once the fixed positions of Yan and Yue are clearly discerned, and one faithfully follows the Way without cease, even with many branching paths, one will not be confused. Only because learners do not clearly see the Way, do not steadfastly follow the Way, seek shallow achievements and immediate results, abandon the level thoroughfare of the Great Way and favor shortcuts, rely on deluded views to create distinctions, and become lost in the convergence of unity and the divergence of a hundred deliberations—like the man who lost the sheep, they ultimately do not know where they are going and turn back. This is why Yangzi was troubled by the lost sheep and diminished in words and laughter.\n\nThe hour of *chen* belongs to the sheep, and *chen* is the correct position of earth. Its association is with the spleen, which is the palace of intent. To lose the sheep is to harm the keeper of intent. Thus Yangzi was moved by this. Zhuangzi’s saying that storing grain and herding sheep are equal to losing the sheep also carries this meaning. Xin Duzi was one who could preserve the mind and guard intent, so he knew to ask about those who studied benevolence and righteousness under the same master yet followed different methods. Yangzi, then, answered with the parable of those who studied swimming yet half drowned. Meng Sunyang, though he stood at the forefront of things, rushed into action and became fragmented from the Way—unlike what Zhuangzi called “Mengzi’s reversal.” Thus he deemed Xin Duzi’s question roundabout and Yangzi’s answer oblique.\n\nThe analogy of learning to swim: those who study the Way aim to transcend life and death, to ferry the people through the realm of no difficulty. Yet learners lose their lives through many methods—are they not like those who study swimming yet drown? Nevertheless, those who drown are not at fault for the water, nor is the loss of life the fault of the Way. If one takes ferrying for profit, one cannot avoid drowning; if one seeks the Way through many methods, one cannot avoid losing life. If one follows the Way of water without selfishness, how can there be drowning? If one follows the level thoroughfare of the Way and does not favor shortcuts, how can there be loss? This is Yangzi’s aspiration.\n\nYang Zhu’s younger brother was named Bu. He went out wearing plain white clothes. When it rained, he removed the white clothes and put on black ones before returning. His dog, not recognizing him, ran out barking. Yang Bu grew angry and was about to strike it. Yang Zhu said: “Do not strike it. You are just the same. If your dog had gone out white and returned black, how could it not be startled?”\n\nThe Explanation states: When the color of clothes changes from white to black and the dog does not recognize it, the man is ready to strike the dog. When external things change and one does not perceive it, one’s joy and anger vary accordingly—whom should one blame? Only those who follow great changes without being submerged can speak of this.\n\nYang Zhu said: “To practice goodness not for the sake of fame, yet fame follows; fame does not seek profit, yet profit comes; profit does not seek conflict, yet conflict arrives. Therefore, the noble person must be cautious in practicing goodness.”\n\nThe Explanation states: If one begins with practicing goodness and ends in conflict, is this so-called goodness truly good? Or is it not good? Therefore, the noble person must be cautious in practicing goodness. To be cautious in practicing goodness does not mean that goodness should not be practiced, nor does it mean that one should merely avoid practicing goodness for the sake of fame. If one does not seek fame, then no one in the world can contend with one.\n\nFormerly, there was a man who claimed to know the Way of not dying. The Lord of Yan sent someone to learn it.

      "translated_text": "The Lord of Yan was furious and intended to punish his envoy. A favored courtier admonished him, saying: “Of all human concerns, none is more urgent than death; of all things one values, none surpasses life. That man lost his own life—how could he have enabled the lord to avoid death?” Thus, the envoy was spared.\n\nThere was a man of Qi who also wished to learn this Way. When he heard that the teacher had died, he struck his chest in regret. Fuzi, upon hearing this, laughed and said: “He desired to learn the Way of not dying, yet when the man himself died, he still regretted it—this is to not understand the very purpose of learning.”\n\nHuzi said: “Fuzi’s words are mistaken. There are those who possess arts they cannot practice, and there are those who can practice arts they do not possess. In Wei, there was a man skilled in calculation who, on his deathbed, explained the method to his son. The son memorized his father’s words but could not put them into practice. Another man asked him, and he recounted what his father had said. The questioner applied the words and practiced the art, achieving results no different from the father’s. If this is so, how could the dead be incapable of transmitting the art of life?”\n\nThe Explanation states: *Zhuangzi* says: “If the Way could be offered as a gift, no one would fail to present it to their lord.” Thus, the Lord of Yan could not compel the man who claimed to know the Way of not dying to offer his art. It also says: “If the Way could be given to others, no one would fail to pass it on to their children and grandchildren.” Thus, the skilled calculator of Wei explained it step by step to his son, yet his son memorized the words but could not practice it.\n\nHowever, the Way can be transmitted but cannot be received. Precisely because it can be transmitted, those who can practice it cannot lack its method; precisely because it cannot be received, some may possess the method yet fail to practice it. The writings of Liezi belong to this category. Since the Way cannot be directly taught or given to others, he had no choice but to embed it in a book, intending that those who awaken may apply its words, practice its method, and thereby align with the Way without discrepancy.\n\nThe people of Handan presented doves to Jianzi on the first morning of the new year.

      "translated_text": "Jianzi said, \"Releasing living creatures on the first morning of the new year demonstrates benevolence.\"\n\nThe guest replied, \"The people know you wish to release them, so they compete to capture them, and many die. If you truly wish to preserve their lives, it would be better to forbid the people from capturing them. To capture and then release them—your benevolence cannot compensate for the harm.\"\n\nJianzi said, \"Indeed.\"\n\nExplanation: The *Yinfu Jing* states: \"Benevolence arises from harm, and harm arises from benevolence. To treat kindness as empty is precisely what harms creatures.\" Heaven and Earth, in their relation to the myriad things, and the sage, in his relation to the hundred clans, assist them through natural spontaneity, without any mind of love or benefit. They regard all things as straw dogs—this is the Way.\n\nThe Tian family of Qi held an ancestral sacrifice in their courtyard, hosting a thousand retainers. Amid the feast, someone presented fish and wild geese. Tian gazed at them and sighed, saying, \"How generous Heaven is to the people! It cultivates the five grains and gives life to fish and birds for their use.\"\n\nThe assembled guests echoed his words in unison. But the son of the Bao family, a boy of twelve seated among them, stepped forward and said, \"It is not as you say. Heaven and Earth, the myriad things, and we humans all arise together as the same kind. There is no hierarchy of noble and base among kinds—only differences in size, intelligence, and strength that lead to mutual domination and predation. Things are not born for one another. Humans take what is edible and eat it—how could Heaven have originally created them for human use? Moreover, mosquitoes and gnats bite our skin, and tigers and wolves devour flesh—did Heaven originally create humans for mosquitoes and gnats, or flesh for tigers and wolves?\"\n\nExplanation: *Zhuangzi* says, \"The myriad things and I are one.\" Thus, the intelligence of birds and beasts naturally aligns with that of humans; only their forms make them seem distant. How could they be born for one another? The divine sages of high antiquity, in their dealings with different kinds, gathered and instructed them just as they did with people, for their minds and intelligence were not far removed from ours. Later generations began to dominate one another through differences in size, intelligence, and strength, preying upon each other. If we claim that creatures are born for human consumption, then mosquitoes and gnats that bite our skin must also be born for the sake of other creatures. Tian’s thousand retainers were not as perceptive as the young son of the Bao family, who had long possessed understanding. This shows that the location of the Way is not restricted by age or youth. The boy of the Bao family may be said to have encountered a thousand men’s worth of insight.\n\nIn Qi, there was a poor man who often begged in the city. The city’s residents grew weary of his frequent appeals, and none would give him anything. He then went to the stables of the Tian family, worked as an assistant to the horse doctor, and borrowed food. Someone in the city mocked him, saying, \"Working for the horse doctor for food—is that not shameful?\"\n\nThe beggar replied, \"Of all shames in the world, none surpasses begging. If begging is not shameful, how could working for the horse doctor be?\"\n\nExplanation: Though laboring for the horse doctor is a lesser shame than begging for food, the poor man of Qi did not initially abandon his resolve because of the shame of begging. He did so only because no one would give him anything. Precisely because he was so content with poverty, even mockery about honor and disgrace could not sway his heart. How much less would one who truly understands the distinction between honor and disgrace be moved by gain and loss, advantage and harm?\n\nA man of Song was traveling on the road when he found a lost contract. He took it home and hid it, secretly counting its notches. He told his neighbor, \"My wealth is assured.\"\n\nExplanation: A lost contract cannot ensure wealth, just as stale words cannot convey the Way. This is like Duke Huan reading a book, prompting the wheelwright to lay down his hammer and chisel and ask him, \"What you are reading is but the dregs of the ancients.\"\n\nA man had a withered parasol tree. His neighbor, an old man, said that withered parasol trees were inauspicious, so the man hastily cut it down. The old neighbor then asked to take it as firewood. The man became displeased and said, \"The old neighbor only wanted firewood and thus urged me to cut it down. To live next to such a treacherous person—how can this be?\"\n\nExplanation: The old neighbor’s remark about the inauspiciousness of the withered parasol tree was not necessarily made with firewood in mind. But by asking to take it as firewood, he trod a suspicious path. The man then deemed him treacherous. Yet who can say whether it was truly the neighbor who was treacherous, or whether the man himself was the source of treachery? In the end, treachery or its absence lies within oneself.\n\nA man lost his axe and suspected his neighbor’s son. He observed the boy’s gait—it was that of an axe thief; his complexion—it was that of an axe thief; his speech—it was that of an axe thief. Every movement and mannerism was that of an axe thief. Later, he dug in his grain cellar and found his axe. The next time he saw his neighbor’s son, none of his movements or mannerisms resembled those of an axe thief.\n\nExplanation: The neighbor’s son had always been the same, but the man who lost the axe harbored suspicion within. Thus, he saw every action as that of an axe thief. Once his suspicion was dispelled, he saw nothing of the sort. From this, we see that the distinctions among the myriad things are all created by our own minds. If scholars can make their intentions sincere, like the man who lost the axe, then they will be in the Way wherever they go. How could external things intrude?\n\nBai Gongsheng was plotting rebellion. After leaving court, he stood motionless, leaning on his staff upside down, its metal tip piercing his chin. Blood flowed to the ground, yet he was unaware. Someone from Zheng heard of this and said, \"If he could forget his chin, what could he not forget?\" When the mind is fixated, one may stumble over a stump or pit, or knock one’s head against a post without realizing it.\n\nExplanation: *Zhuangzi* says, \"The perfected person has no self.\" Those who do not know the Way cling to the notion of a self. They look upon their own bodies—all the limbs, the nine orifices, the six viscera—all present within. How could they not have a self? Why not observe Bai Gongsheng? When perverse thoughts fester within, one may even forget one’s chin—what could one not forget? How much more so when one inwardly attains the Way? Then the body merges with the great unity, and the absence of self becomes self-evident.",

      "translated_text": "Once, there was a man of Qi who coveted gold. At dawn, he dressed in his finest robes and went to the market. Arriving at the gold-seller’s stall, he seized the gold and departed. The authorities captured him and asked, “With so many people present, how could you take another’s gold?” He replied, “When I took the gold, I saw no one—only the gold.”\n\nExplanation: To see an object and seize it like gold is to have no Dao beyond things. To see the Dao and seize it like gold is to have no things beyond the Dao. The *Liezi* concludes with this passage, for the eight chapters all use things to illuminate the Dao. Whether later readers awaken to it or not depends entirely on the interplay of desire and non-desire, perception and non-perception.\n\nThe *Shuofu* chapter explains: The essence of the Dao admits no single thing, transcending all speech. Its function excludes no thing, residing in form and number. Where there is form, there is name; where there is number, there is order. The constancy of waxing and waning is as unchanging as a tally’s reliability; the verifiability of beginning and end is as precise as a tally’s alignment. Nothing is more numinous than Heaven, whose Dao accords with yin and yang; nothing is more abundant than Earth, whose principle accords with softness and hardness. Nothing is greater than the emperors and kings, whose virtue accords with benevolence and righteousness. Like a shadow to its form, crookedness and straightness follow without alteration; like an echo to its sound, high and low depend without deviation. The virtue of Shennong and the Flame Emperor embodied this alone; the books of Yu, Xia, Shang, and Zhou recorded this alone; the words of legalists and worthies elucidated this alone. Thus, the teachings of Liezi, having exhausted the ultimate of the supreme Dao from the *Yang Zhu* chapter onward, necessarily conclude with the *Shuofu*. For the ultimate of the supreme Dao is not merely obscure and silent—it is through this that one responds and penetrates the world’s affairs, hence the matters of the *Shuofu*.\n\nThe meaning of the *Shuofu* lies in this: for oneself, there are measures; for others, there are standards. In navigating the world, one must esteem the Dao; in governing, one must recognize worthies. In responding to affairs, wisdom is key; in securing victory, the Dao is fundamental. Governing the state begins with cultivating the self; averting resentment arises from humility. Benefits bestowed bring true returns; resentments incurred invite harm—thus the worthy are cautious in their actions. Fame does not seek profit, yet profit follows; profit does not seek conflict, yet conflict arises—thus the noble person is cautious in doing good. All its words concern the peace and peril of the world’s ways, the gains and losses of human principles. All its deeds are those that speech can discuss and intention can discern. Therefore, to speak of the Dao without the *Shuofu* is insufficient to constitute the Dao.\n\nYet Liezi begins with the *Tian Rui* and concludes with the *Shuofu*. The *Tian Rui* is the tally of nature; it speaks of Heaven’s wondrous Dao, which aligns with creation and transformation, proceeding from Heaven to humanity. The *Shuofu* speaks of human affairs manifestly verifying the wondrousness of the supreme Dao, proceeding from humanity to Heaven. The great Dao’s course is like a ring’s ceaseless revolution, without accumulation—its boundaries cannot be exhausted, its path cannot be fathomed. It is ever-generating, ever-transforming, and nothing more.\n\nExamining the *Liezi* from the *Tian Rui* onward, the sequence reveals the essence of the great Dao. The movement of Heaven’s Dao necessarily begins with the *Tian Rui*. The sage’s response to the world is greatest in emperors and kings, thus the *Yellow Emperor* follows the *Tian Rui*, and the *King Mu* follows the *Yellow Emperor*. Of the Three Dynasties’ kings, none surpassed Wen and Wu; by King Mu’s time, the royal enterprise had declined. Not speaking of its flourishing but of its decline clarifies that once the wondrousness of the great Dao unfolds, it does not remain purely constant but inevitably deteriorates. After the governance of the Yellow Emperor, there must follow the decline of King Mu. With the governance of emperors and kings established, were it not for Confucius—the primordial sage—who edited the *Odes*, fixed the *Documents*, struck the *Changes*, and composed the *Classics*, the achievements of emperors and kings would not be known to later ages. Thus, the Dao of emperors and kings culminates in Confucius alone as the great completer of their enterprise. Therefore, the *Confucius* follows the *King Mu*, and from Confucius onward, the transmission of the Dao’s sequence is exhaustive.\n\nLiezi, fearing that later ages might diverge unevenly and fragment the Dao, thus employed the *Tang Wen* to exhaust its variations, preventing things from obstructing the Dao. In essence, the myriad things’ changes all arise from power, and their outcomes are all governed by fate. Hence, the *Li Ming* presents questions and answers, ultimately returning to nature, desiring that people not be controlled by external fate. As for the *Yang Zhu* chapter, it dispenses with the emptiness of the myriad things’ names to grasp the Dao’s ultimate attainment. When the Dao reaches this point, it is complete and cannot be surpassed. Yet the Dao cannot end in nothingness, so the *Shuofu* concludes it.\n\nFrom this perspective, Liezi’s teachings emerge as the *Tian Rui* and return as the *Shuofu*—thus transmitting the Dao of the Yellow Emperor, Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Wen, Wu, Zhou, and Confucius. He is what was called a “vast and authentic perfected person of antiquity.” That he styled himself Master Liezi was because he was a master, like Confucius, distinct from the masters of the various schools. Later scholars who failed to grasp the circumstances of his work deemed him unaligned with the Dao of emperors and kings, lumping his classic with the various masters. This is merely using a tube to view the sky—such a view is narrow, hardly worth mentioning. Scholars should devote their hearts to it.\n\n*The Explication of the Perfect Virtue of the Vacuous and Authentic Classic, Scroll Twenty, concludes.*",
      "overlap_context": ", \"The perfected person has no self.\" Those who do not know the Way cling to the notion of a self. They look upon their own bodies—all the limbs, the nine orifices, the six viscera—all present within. How could they not have a self? Why not observe Bai Gongsheng? When perverse thoughts fester within, one may even forget one’s chin—what could one not forget? How much more so when one inwardly attains the Way? Then the body merges with the great unity, and the absence of self becomes self-evident.",
