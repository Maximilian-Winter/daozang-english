  "full_translation": "**The Supreme Cavern Mystery Numinous Treasure Scripture of Soaring Through the Three Realms and Communing with Subtle Inner Contemplation**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Supreme Cavern Mystery Numinous Treasure Scripture of Soaring Through the Three Realms and Communing with Subtle Inner Contemplation*. Author unknown, likely composed during the Northern and Southern Dynasties or the Sui-Tang period. Not recorded in the *Catalogue of Numinous Treasure Scriptures*. One scroll. Base text from the *Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Unity Tradition*, Peace Section.\n\n---\n\nThe Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate declares:\nThe Supreme Numinous Treasure enables flight through the Three Realms and the concealed preservation of the Supreme Dao. Those who maintain a prolonged fast and cultivate practice for a hundred days will find all illnesses dispelled, their complexion radiant, white hair restored to black, and fallen teeth regrown. After two hundred days of practice, marrow fills the bones, the intestines transform into sinews, scars and burns vanish, and stiffness, muteness, blindness, and deafness are cured, restoring sight and hearing. After three hundred days, one may pass through barriers without obstruction, command ghosts and spirits, ascend into the void, tread upon floating clouds, and roam freely to reach the Kunlun Mountains. After three years, one attains the Dao and achieves Perfection, wandering the Eight Extremities, riding a chariot drawn by qilin, with white tigers as attendants and azure dragons sweeping the dust. After five years, one summons and roams the Three Realms, ascending to the rank of Immortal King.\n\nThe subtlety of these words lies in the Dao being magnified through human effort. How could this be mere idle discourse? Truly, the Emperor upholds and magnifies it, for the Dao endures while humanity perishes. How vast is the treasury of the Supreme Numinous Treasure!\n\nThe Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate declares:\nThe *Numinous Treasure Supreme Perfected Scarlet Yang Elixir of the Sun’s Radiance, Jade Token for Ascending to Heaven*, is secretly preserved in the Golden Tower of the Jade Capital Mountain in the Upper Palace. It is not transmitted to those without the destiny of immortality—only to those whose rank corresponds to Immortal King, Immortal Duke, or Immortal Minister. If you encounter this, it is because your predestined karmic affinity has been recorded in the Upper Clarity, and you must present credentials and swear an oath to receive it.\n\nThe Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate declares:\nMaster and disciple must each observe a thirty-day fast, followed by a three-day joint fast. Expel all impurities, seek emptiness and numinosity, and await a response in that very moment. Only then may you inscribe the talisman, wear it, and proceed with the practice.\n\nThe Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate declares:\nConsume and refine qi, exhale and inhale essence, preserve the spirit in stillness, and gird yourself with the Supreme Perfected.\n\nThe Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate declares:\nAfter twenty-one days in seclusion, you will behold the Perfected Spirits. Transformation occurs in an instant—short and long shift, sources are moved, flows are blocked, and the Scarlet Yang is ingested.\n\nThe Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate declares:\nRefine the Eight Stones with water to fix gold, boil sand to ascend, and swallow the Yin of the Elixir.\n\nThe Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate declares:\nContemplate the spirit of the Dao in your heart, dwell in immortal wanderings, and await the traces of longing to ingest the Responsive Yang.\n\nThe Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate declares:\nThe talisman is ethereal and distant—gaze toward the luminous peaks, yearn upward to watch the clouds and think of celestial blessings, desiring to ascend the void and ride the clouds to reach Heaven.\n\nThe Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate declares:\nWhen the Dao is achieved, you will wear all its emblems and ascend Mount Hua. Only upon reaching the celestial steps may you suddenly ingest it.\n\nConsume and refine qi, exhale and inhale essence, preserve the spirit in stillness, and gird yourself with the Supreme Perfected. After twenty-one days in seclusion, you will behold the Perfected Spirits.\n\n---\n\n**The Yin of the Supreme Perfected Numinous Treasure**\n\nThe Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate declares:\nUse a jade pouch to request and wear it; do not tread upon defilement.\n\nThe Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate declares:\nTo cultivate the Dao of *Soaring Through the Three Realms of the Numinous Treasure*, on the days of Jiazi, Jiaxu, Jiashen, Jiawu, Jiachen, and Jiayin, enter the fasting hall, face east, and knock the teeth. Visualize in your heart: *\"Verdant forests and mysterious images, flowing waters—how do they fare? Fire blazes around the body—how can others know? The Dao comes to me, and the primordial qi harmonizes naturally.\"*\n\nThe Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate declares:\nTo cultivate the Dao of *Soaring Through the Three Realms of the Numinous Treasure*, on the days of Renshen, Renwu, Renchen, Renyin, Renzi, Renxu, Guiyou, Guiwei, Guisi, Guichou, Guihai, and Guimao, enter the fasting hall, face north, and knock the teeth.

Visualize in your heart: *\"Heavenly Dao, Heavenly Dao, I wish for agelessness, to match the Yellow Center in longevity, to rise with the sun at dawn. May my life be prolonged, and may I endure with the Dao.\"*\n\nThe Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate declares:\nTo cultivate the Dao of *Soaring Through the Three Realms of the Numinous Treasure*, on the days of the Six Jia, when the po wanders the Mysterious Palace, visualize in your heart a divine person clad in white radiance, resembling a Jade Maiden.\n\nThe Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate declares:\nTo cultivate the Dao of *Soaring Through the Three Realms of the Numinous Treasure*, on the days of the Six Gui, when the hun resides in the Bladder, concentrate on the divine person within the kidneys, whose crimson radiance resembles a Jade Youth.\n\nThe Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate declares:\nTo cultivate the Dao of *Soaring Through the Three Realms of the Numinous Treasure*, every person possesses five hearts, their essence most profound, collectively called the Five Gate Child. Constantly visualize within your heart a single being, the primordial origin of divine transcendence. In their left hand, the Primordial Beginning; in their right, the Primordial Simplicity. Their left foot marks dawn; their right, dusk—both suffused with crimson qi. This is called the Primordial Lord, the abode of the Five Emperors. The lungs are the Stone Chamber; the liver, the Orchid Terrace. The heart’s seal is gold; the kidneys’ seal, silver.\n\nThe Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate declares:\nTo cultivate the Dao of *Soaring Through the Three Realms of the Numinous Treasure*, on the day of *Lichun* (Beginning of Spring), purify yourself in fasting and face east, reciting the incantation: *\"Eastern Azure Tooth, consume the Azure Tooth, drink the morning’s blossom.\"* The morning’s blossom lies beyond the lips—swallow thrice.\n\nThe Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate declares:\nTo cultivate the Dao of *Soaring Through the Three Realms of the Numinous Treasure*, on the day of *Lixia* (Beginning of Summer), purify yourself in fasting and face south, reciting the incantation: *\"Southern Vermilion Cinnabar, consume the Vermilion Cinnabar, drink from the Cinnabar Pool.\"* The Cinnabar Pool lies within the lips—swallow thrice.\n\nThe Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate declares:\nTo cultivate the Dao of *Soaring Through the Three Realms of the Numinous Treasure*, on the months of the four seasons, purify yourself in fasting and face the sovereign, reciting the incantation: *\"Central Yellow Wilds, towering Great Mountain, consume the primordial qi, drink from the Sweet Spring.\"* The Sweet Spring hangs above the suspended breastbone—swallow thrice.\n\nThe Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate declares:\nTo cultivate the Dao of *Soaring Through the Three Realms of the Numinous Treasure*, on the day of *Liqiu* (Beginning of Autumn), purify yourself in fasting and face west, reciting the incantation: *\"Western Luminous Stone, consume the Luminous Stone, drink the numinous fluid.\"* The numinous fluid rests upon the teeth—swallow thrice.\n\nThe Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate declares:\nTo cultivate the Dao of *Soaring Through the Three Realms of the Numinous Treasure*, on the day of *Lidong* (Beginning of Winter), purify yourself in fasting and face north, reciting the incantation: *\"Northern Mystic Essence, consume the Mystic Essence, drink the Jade Nectar.\"* The Jade Nectar lies beneath the tongue—swallow thrice.\n\nThe Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate declares:\nTo cultivate the Dao of *Soaring Through the Three Realms of the Numinous Treasure*, at midnight, visualize above the Cinnabar Pool the divine water and the five-colored qi of white clouds emerging from the Mysterious Gate, descending through the three pathways of the kidneys, ascending directly into the Crimson Palace, drifting beneath the Flowery Canopy, and returning to the Muddy Pellet.\n\nThe Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate declares:\nTo cultivate the Dao of *Soaring Through the Three Realms of the Numinous Treasure*, on the first day of the lunar month, the fifth, fifteenth, twenty-fifth, *Jiawu*, *Bingwu*, and *Wuwu* days, from dawn until noon, face the sun with unbound hair, lie supine with eyes closed, and visualize the sun as if it were the great solar orb, returning to the Crimson Palace to merge its virtue with yours, both nourishing the Crimson Palace. Then, visualize within your heart the Mysterious Canopy, beneath which lies the sun, and within the sun, a being called the Supreme Unity Jade Maiden, her form that of a youthful child, crimson qi circulating around the sun thirty times before halting at its center.\n\nThe Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate declares:\nTo cultivate the Dao of *Soaring Through the Three Realms of the Numinous Treasure*, consume the essence of the sun. Constantly visualize your heart as radiant crimson like the sun, its crimson qi spreading in all directions, suffusing your entire body. Envision within your heart the sun, and within the sun, the Mysterious Canopy. Beneath the canopy stand three figures: on the left, the Primordial Beginning; on the right, the Supreme Unity of the Southern Culmen; and in the center, the Crimson Child. To your left, the Jade Maiden, consort of the Old Master, bearing a golden platter and jade bowl, offering divine wine and feeding you divine elixirs and sacred mushrooms. With time, the Six Ding spirits will arrive. Practice this from dawn until noon. The Supreme Mystery spirit ascends into the Muddy Pellet, the crimson qi entering the brain within the head, circling the mouth nine times before halting. The crimson qi descends into the Crimson Palace, proceeding directly to the Cinnabar Field, where it merges with the qi there.\n\nThe Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate declares:\nTo cultivate the Dao of *Soaring Through the Three Realms of the Numinous Treasure*, consume the essence of the moon.

At the hour of *Renshen* (person’s hour), enter the Weak Waters, ascend Kunlun Mountain, and at midnight, bathe again in the Cinnabar Pool.

On the days of the new moon, full moon, and last day of the lunar month, also visualize thus: within the kidneys, a great Numinous Tortoise, its patterns five-colored, its form like woven silk, above it Mystic Radiance, below it divine water. White qi from the kidneys encircles the body once, the sun to the left, the moon to the right, ascending to the Upper Prime. On the days of the new moon, full moon, and the eight seasonal nodes, recite the incantation: *\"Recorder of the Six Ding Jade Maidens, erase my name from the register of death. The Twelve Great Officers all proclaim: As decreed by the statutes of the Great Numinous Treasure.\"*\n\nThe Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate declares:\nTo cultivate the Dao of *Soaring Through the Three Realms of the Numinous Treasure*, consume the essence of the Dipper. Constantly visualize within the spleen the yellow qi, above which lie the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper.

Constantly visualize within the head a purple cloud emerging like a purple canopy, gradually expanding until it fills the horizon. The fluttering purple canopy’s qi directly enters the Supreme Ultimate. Visualize within the Crimson Palace the youthful child, the Jade Maiden of the Supreme Unity—three figures in all—seated beneath the purple canopy, holding a jade platter and golden cup, pouring wine, consuming divine elixir and sacred mushrooms. By constant visualization, one remains ageless, ascending through the Three Realms, passing the Celestial Emperor’s fasting examination.\n\nThe Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate declares:\nTo cultivate the Dao of *Soaring Through the Three Realms of the Numinous Treasure*, one must practice the *Three Sovereigns of the Supreme Ultimate*. Constantly visualize upon the forehead the Northern Dipper, above which are three stars resembling strung pearls, each as large as a chicken egg, their hues blending in primordial chaos.

Together, nourish the youthful child of the Crimson Palace.\"* Complete the practice.\n\nThe Perfected One of the Great Ultimate said: In cultivating the Dao of the Numinous Treasure for soaring through the Three Realms, on the seventh and eighth days of the month, as well as *Gengshen* and *Wushen* days, at dusk, consume the essence of the lungs.

The yellow qi from the North Star descends into the body and cease.\n\nThe Perfected One of the Great Ultimate said: In cultivating the Dao of the Numinous Treasure for soaring through the Three Realms, on *Jiazi*, *Jiawu*, the last day of the month, and the new moon, at midnight enter the purification hall. Visualize the Cinnabar Field situated behind the navel, six inches in diameter, radiant red like the sun. The primordial yang qi of the Five Lads surges like storm clouds—blue-green on the left, white on the right, with yellow qi at the center. Within it stands a red figure, nine fen in height. White qi covers it, red qi encircles it, and black qi envelops its exterior. Within, perceive this figure, its essence connecting to the Crimson Palace. Cease.\n\nThe Perfected One of the Great Ultimate said: In cultivating the Dao of the Numinous Treasure for soaring through the Three Realms, one must practice the Way of the Hall of Light. At cock’s crow, mealtime, and sunset, enter the purification hall, performing this thrice daily. Visualize the Great Granary within the stomach, pure white like cream, filled with flourishing yellow qi. Cease.\n\nThe Perfected One of the Great Ultimate said: In cultivating the Dao of soaring flight, one must practice the Way of the Central Ultimate.\n\nOn the days of the eight solar terms—Beginning of Spring, Spring Equinox, Beginning of Summer, Summer Solstice, Beginning of Autumn, Autumn Equinox, Beginning of Winter, Winter Solstice—as well as the first day of the twelfth lunar month and New Year’s Eve, at the hour of *rending*, enter the purification hall, face north upon the high seat, and pay homage to the Three Treasures and the ten directions. First to the north, then the east, then the south, then the west, then the northwest, then above, then the northeast, then the southeast, then below, then the southwest—each direction receiving one bow. Next, pay homage to the assembly of Great Sages in the four directions, three bows to each, completing the full circuit.\n\nRecite: \"Disciple of the Three Luminaries, so-and-so, from youth has cherished the Great Dao, desiring long life. Today, I beseech the Northern Lord of Grand Unity, the Director of Destinies, and the Recorder of Deeds to erase my name from the register of death and inscribe it in the register of long life.\" Thereupon, while lying down, visualize the Five Cities and Twelve Towers, with the Twelve Great Officers at their center, clad in vermilion robes, the waters of the River flowing through and distributing into the four limbs.\n\nThen recite the incantation: \"Jade Maidens of the Six Dings under the Recorder of Deeds, erase my name from the death tally and inscribe it in the jade register of divine immortals. My name is recorded in the Azure Register, and from this day forth, I shall transcend the Three Realms and roam beyond the Nine Heavens.\" Cease.\n\nThe Perfected One of the Great Ultimate said: In cultivating the Dao of the Numinous Treasure for soaring through the Three Realms, one must first practice the Way of the Rivers. Constantly visualize the surging, billowing clouds forming the rivers: the large intestine as the Yangtze, the small intestine as the Yellow River, the bladder as the Weak Water—the root of human life. The Jade Water is profoundly subtle; the rivers are supremely divine. Cease.\n\nThe Perfected One of the Great Ultimate said: In cultivating the Dao of soaring flight through the Three Realms, one must practice the Way of Primordial Qi. On the days of *guihai*, *jiazi*, and the dark and new moons, at midnight, visualize the Weak Water and the churning clouds rising from between the kidneys. White qi converges and ascends, passing through the Five Palaces, entering the Mud Pill Palace above and the Bubbling Spring below, circulating throughout the body. Then visualize the Jade Maiden of Mystic Radiance ascending through the Central Channel, crowned with the Bright Star, illuminating the entire body. Primordial qi spreads in all directions. Cease at cock’s crow.\n\nThe Perfected One of the Great Ultimate said: One must practice the Way of Ease and Benefit.

Next, visualize the primordial qi of the Great Clarity, swirling like clouds and mist, descending into the body, dense as clouds entering mountains, enduring for ten thousand generations. Cease.\n\nThe Perfected One of the Great Ultimate said: In cultivating the Dao of soaring flight through the Three Realms, one must practice the Way of Gates and Doors. From the first to the fifteenth day of each lunar month, enter the purification hall and meditate in stillness. Visualize the ten fingers as gates and doors, with primordial qi flowing directly into them until all grow warm. The hun-soul emerges from within, guiding it to come and go. Cease after ninety breaths. From the sixteenth to the last day of the month, visualize the primordial qi descending to the ten toes until all grow warm. Cease after nine breaths.\n\nThe Perfected One of the Great Ultimate said: In cultivating the Dao of soaring flight through the Three Realms, one must practice the Way of Mystic Transformation. On the day of *guihai*, at the hour of *rending*, enter the purification hall and visualize the inverted figure within the Mystic Grand Scripture, seven *cun* in height. Visualize the Mystic Mao and Qian as dry and yellow, then visualize the Mystic Lai as true black, its color drawn forth, moist and radiant. Cease at midnight.\n\nThe Perfected One of the Great Ultimate said: In cultivating the Dao of soaring flight through the Three Realms, one must visualize the yellow essence and red qi of the sun descending into the mouth. Swallow it twenty-seven times. Then recite the incantation: \"Lord of the Sun, Lady of the Moon, divine, divine! Return to the Crimson Palace, together nurturing the Jade Maidens of the Grand Unity, never departing from their palace.\" Recite this incantation three times. Then visualize the white qi from the lungs ascending to the mouth and swallow it twenty-one times. Next, recite the incantation: \"Hongda attained the Dao; Taibai Ziqī, unite with me in virtue, that I may live long and never die.\" Recite this three times.\n\nThe Perfected One of the Great Ultimate said: In cultivating the Dao of soaring flight through the Three Realms, one must constantly visualize twelve stalks of lingzhi within the heart, their color a true vermilion jade, connected above to the lungs. This is called the \"Thought Arrow.\" Grasp it with intention, and the Grand Unity’s wrath is drawn forth. The heart’s true roundness is called \"Majestic Joy.\" These are the Celestial Grand Unity and the Dao Grand Unity. Constantly guard and contemplate them with focused attention.\n\nThe Perfected One of the Great Ultimate said: In cultivating the Dao of soaring flight through the Three Realms, one must constantly visualize the red qi of the heart descending to connect with the kidneys. Constantly visualize the white qi between the kidneys ascending into the heart, while the heart’s red qi descends into the kidneys. Between them, white qi ascends unceasingly for ten thousand generations. This is called the \"Primordial Qi of Yin and Yang.\"\n\nThe Perfected One of the Great Ultimate said: In cultivating the Dao of soaring flight through the Three Realms, one must constantly visualize the Grand Unity’s purple sash and golden seal, bearing the Jade Flower Talisman. The seal is called \"Majestic Joy,\" the Heavenly Emperor’s trustworthy signet. Seven figures, each bearing a sword and holding a talisman, walk before you, halt behind you, sit to your left, and lie to your right. Constantly visualize and maintain this awareness.\n\nThe Perfected One of the Great Ultimate said: In cultivating the Dao of soaring flight through the Three Realms, one must constantly practice the Way of the Central Ultimate. Visualize the yellow figure above the spleen, three *cun* in height, with a yellow figure in each hand. Yellow qi ascends to heaven and descends into the body. Upon seeing this spirit, recite the incantation: \"Yellow-robed one, Yellow-robed one, the Perfected One of the Yellow Court is within me. Fetch for me sweet wine, rich meats, divine lingzhi herbs, and all that may be consumed.\"\n\nThen guide and swallow it, completing the process three to five times.\n\nThe Perfected One of the Great Ultimate said: The Supreme Dao of the Numinous Treasure’s hidden journey and soaring flight through the Three Realms cannot be sought without authenticity, nor learned without the Way. If one cultivates with precision for five years, one may transcend and wander the Three Realms, ascending to the Jade Capital—this is the utmost subtlety of the Three Caverns, the crown of all scriptures. Those who cultivate it should purify their hearts and sever all external entanglements. If one fails to do so, even after years of accumulation, nothing will be gained, and one will merely waste their years in vain observation—how lamentable!\n\nThe Perfected One of the Great Ultimate said: The transmission of the covenant must adhere to the fivefold invocation of the ancient statutes, the jade instructions, and essential teachings. One must separately present three taels of refined gold and a bolt of life-thread silk, its length matching the recipient’s age. If you can study diligently, you may become a guest of the Supreme Lord, roaming the golden palaces and attaining the ranks of the loftiest immortals. How can one not be exhorted? How can one not be diligent?\n\nThe Perfected One of the Great Ultimate said: Should one violate the covenant by reckless transmission, or fail to observe the prescribed years, or transmit without the proper oath, the sin will extend to seven generations—bound to the stones of Lianshan, piled into the River of Eternal Night, never to be absolved for ten thousand kalpas. One’s own body will also perish; how then can immortality be expected? Be vigilant and prudent.\n\nHere ends *The Supreme Scripture of the Numinous Treasure: The Esoteric Contemplation of Soaring Flight Through the Three Realms and Penetrating the Subtle*.",

Author unknown, likely composed during the Northern and Southern Dynasties or the Sui-Tang period. Not recorded in the *Catalogue of Numinous Treasure Scriptures*. One scroll. Base text from the *Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Unity Tradition*, Peace Section.\n\n---\n\nThe Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate declares:\nThe Supreme Numinous Treasure enables flight through the Three Realms and the concealed preservation of the Supreme Dao. Those who maintain a prolonged fast and cultivate practice for a hundred days will find all illnesses dispelled, their complexion radiant, white hair restored to black, and fallen teeth regrown. After two hundred days of practice, marrow fills the bones, the intestines transform into sinews, scars and burns vanish, and stiffness, muteness, blindness, and deafness are cured, restoring sight and hearing. After three hundred days, one may pass through barriers without obstruction, command ghosts and spirits, ascend into the void, tread upon floating clouds, and roam freely to reach the Kunlun Mountains. After three years, one attains the Dao and achieves Perfection, wandering the Eight Extremities, riding a chariot drawn by qilin, with white tigers as attendants and azure dragons sweeping the dust. After five years, one summons and roams the Three Realms, ascending to the rank of Immortal King.\n\nThe subtlety of these words lies in the Dao being magnified through human effort. How could this be mere idle discourse? Truly, the Emperor upholds and magnifies it, for the Dao endures while humanity perishes. How vast is the treasury of the Supreme Numinous Treasure!\n\nThe Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate declares:\nThe *Numinous Treasure Supreme Perfected Scarlet Yang Elixir of the Sun’s Radiance, Jade Token for Ascending to Heaven*, is secretly preserved in the Golden Tower of the Jade Capital Mountain in the Upper Palace. It is not transmitted to those without the destiny of immortality—only to those whose rank corresponds to Immortal King, Immortal Duke, or Immortal Minister. If you encounter this, it is because your predestined karmic affinity has been recorded in the Upper Clarity, and you must present credentials and swear an oath to receive it.\n\nThe Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate declares:\nMaster and disciple must each observe a thirty-day fast, followed by a three-day joint fast. Expel all impurities, seek emptiness and numinosity, and await a response in that very moment. Only then may you inscribe the talisman, wear it, and proceed with the practice.\n\nThe Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate declares:\nConsume and refine qi, exhale and inhale essence, preserve the spirit in stillness, and gird yourself with the Supreme Perfected.\n\nThe Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate declares:\nAfter twenty-one days in seclusion, you will behold the Perfected Spirits. Transformation occurs in an instant—short and long shift, sources are moved, flows are blocked, and the Scarlet Yang is ingested.\n\nThe Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate declares:\nRefine the Eight Stones with water to fix gold, boil sand to ascend, and swallow the Yin of the Elixir.\n\nThe Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate declares:\nContemplate the spirit of the Dao in your heart, dwell in immortal wanderings, and await the traces of longing to ingest the Responsive Yang.\n\nThe Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate declares:\nThe talisman is ethereal and distant—gaze toward the luminous peaks, yearn upward to watch the clouds and think of celestial blessings, desiring to ascend the void and ride the clouds to reach Heaven.\n\nThe Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate declares:\nWhen the Dao is achieved, you will wear all its emblems and ascend Mount Hua. Only upon reaching the celestial steps may you suddenly ingest it.\n\nConsume and refine qi, exhale and inhale essence, preserve the spirit in stillness, and gird yourself with the Supreme Perfected. After twenty-one days in seclusion, you will behold the Perfected Spirits.\n\n---\n\n**The Yin of the Supreme Perfected Numinous Treasure**\n\nThe Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate declares:\nUse a jade pouch to request and wear it; do not tread upon defilement.\n\nThe Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate declares:\nTo cultivate the Dao of *Soaring Through the Three Realms of the Numinous Treasure*, on the days of Jiazi, Jiaxu, Jiashen, Jiawu, Jiachen, and Jiayin, enter the fasting hall, face east, and knock the teeth. Visualize in your heart: *\"Verdant forests and mysterious images, flowing waters—how do they fare? Fire blazes around the body—how can others know? The Dao comes to me, and the primordial qi harmonizes naturally.\"*\n\nThe Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate declares:\nTo cultivate the Dao of *Soaring Through the Three Realms of the Numinous Treasure*, on the days of Renshen, Renwu, Renchen, Renyin, Renzi, Renxu, Guiyou, Guiwei, Guisi, Guichou, Guihai, and Guimao, enter the fasting hall, face north, and knock the teeth. Visualize in your heart: *\"I wish to behold the Heavenly Mirror, the mysterious nourishment of the Jade Pool. Restore white to black, and remain ever an infant. The spirits come to me, and the Five Viscera follow.\"*\n\nThe Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate declares:\nTo cultivate the Dao of *Soaring Through the Three Realms of the Numinous Treasure*, on the days of Gengwu, Gengchen, Gengyin, Gengzi, Gengxu, Gengshen, Xinwei, Xinsi, Xinmao, Xinchou, Xinyou, and Xinhai, enter the fasting hall, face west, and knock the teeth. Visualize in your heart: *\"Root child, root child, white clouds arise originally. Mist gathers across ten thousand leagues. May the numinous come to me, abide, and serve me. Return to the original movement, ending and beginning anew.\"*\n\nThe Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate declares:\nTo cultivate the Dao of *Soaring Through the Three Realms of the Numinous Treasure*, on the days of Bingyin, Bingzi, Bingxu, Bingshen, Bingwu, Bingchen, Dingmao, Dingchou, Dinghai, Dingyou, Dingwei, and Dingsi, enter the fasting hall, face south, and knock the teeth. Visualize in your heart: *\"Vermilion Bird, Scarlet Pool, Heavenly Sea, Earthly River. I wish for immortality, to partake of perfect harmony, to match the Two Modes in longevity, and to attain ten thousandfold aspirations.\"*\n\nThe Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate declares:\nTo cultivate the Dao of *Soaring Through the Three Realms of the Numinous Treasure*, on the days of Wuchen, Wuyin, Wuzi, Wuxu, Wushen, Wuwu, Jisi, Jimao, Jichou, Jihai, Jiyou, and Jiwei, enter the fasting hall, face east, lie down with a level pillow, and knock the teeth. Visualize in your heart: *\"Heavenly Dao, Heavenly Dao, I wish for agelessness, to match the Yellow Center in longevity, to rise with the sun at dawn. May my life be prolonged, and may I endure with the Dao.\"*\n\nThe Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate declares:\nTo cultivate the Dao of *Soaring Through the Three Realms of the Numinous Treasure*, on the days of the Six Jia, when the po wanders the Mysterious Palace, visualize in your heart a divine person clad in white radiance, resembling a Jade Maiden.\n\nThe Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate declares:\nTo cultivate the Dao of *Soaring Through the Three Realms of the Numinous Treasure*, on the days of the Six Gui, when the hun resides in the Bladder, concentrate on the divine person within the kidneys, whose crimson radiance resembles a Jade Youth.",

Constantly visualize within your heart a single being, the primordial origin of divine transcendence. In their left hand, the Primordial Beginning; in their right, the Primordial Simplicity. Their left foot marks dawn; their right, dusk—both suffused with crimson qi. This is called the Primordial Lord, the abode of the Five Emperors. The lungs are the Stone Chamber; the liver, the Orchid Terrace. The heart’s seal is gold; the kidneys’ seal, silver.\n\nThe Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate declares:\nTo cultivate the Dao of *Soaring Through the Three Realms of the Numinous Treasure*, on the day of *Lichun* (Beginning of Spring), purify yourself in fasting and face east, reciting the incantation: *\"Eastern Azure Tooth, consume the Azure Tooth, drink the morning’s blossom.\"* The morning’s blossom lies beyond the lips—swallow thrice.\n\nThe Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate declares:\nTo cultivate the Dao of *Soaring Through the Three Realms of the Numinous Treasure*, on the day of *Lixia* (Beginning of Summer), purify yourself in fasting and face south, reciting the incantation: *\"Southern Vermilion Cinnabar, consume the Vermilion Cinnabar, drink from the Cinnabar Pool.\"* The Cinnabar Pool lies within the lips—swallow thrice.\n\nThe Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate declares:\nTo cultivate the Dao of *Soaring Through the Three Realms of the Numinous Treasure*, on the months of the four seasons, purify yourself in fasting and face the sovereign, reciting the incantation: *\"Central Yellow Wilds, towering Great Mountain, consume the primordial qi, drink from the Sweet Spring.\"* The Sweet Spring hangs above the suspended breastbone—swallow thrice.\n\nThe Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate declares:\nTo cultivate the Dao of *Soaring Through the Three Realms of the Numinous Treasure*, on the day of *Liqiu* (Beginning of Autumn), purify yourself in fasting and face west, reciting the incantation: *\"Western Luminous Stone, consume the Luminous Stone, drink the numinous fluid.\"* The numinous fluid rests upon the teeth—swallow thrice.\n\nThe Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate declares:\nTo cultivate the Dao of *Soaring Through the Three Realms of the Numinous Treasure*, on the day of *Lidong* (Beginning of Winter), purify yourself in fasting and face north, reciting the incantation: *\"Northern Mystic Essence, consume the Mystic Essence, drink the Jade Nectar.\"* The Jade Nectar lies beneath the tongue—swallow thrice.\n\nThe Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate declares:\nTo cultivate the Dao of *Soaring Through the Three Realms of the Numinous Treasure*, at midnight, visualize above the Cinnabar Pool the divine water and the five-colored qi of white clouds emerging from the Mysterious Gate, descending through the three pathways of the kidneys, ascending directly into the Crimson Palace, drifting beneath the Flowery Canopy, and returning to the Muddy Pellet.\n\nThe Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate declares:\nTo cultivate the Dao of *Soaring Through the Three Realms of the Numinous Treasure*, on the first day of the lunar month, the fifth, fifteenth, twenty-fifth, *Jiawu*, *Bingwu*, and *Wuwu* days, from dawn until noon, face the sun with unbound hair, lie supine with eyes closed, and visualize the sun as if it were the great solar orb, returning to the Crimson Palace to merge its virtue with yours, both nourishing the Crimson Palace. Then, visualize within your heart the Mysterious Canopy, beneath which lies the sun, and within the sun, a being called the Supreme Unity Jade Maiden, her form that of a youthful child, crimson qi circulating around the sun thirty times before halting at its center.\n\nThe Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate declares:\nTo cultivate the Dao of *Soaring Through the Three Realms of the Numinous Treasure*, consume the essence of the sun. Constantly visualize your heart as radiant crimson like the sun, its crimson qi spreading in all directions, suffusing your entire body.

Beneath the canopy stand three figures: on the left, the Primordial Beginning; on the right, the Supreme Unity of the Southern Culmen; and in the center, the Crimson Child. To your left, the Jade Maiden, consort of the Old Master, bearing a golden platter and jade bowl, offering divine wine and feeding you divine elixirs and sacred mushrooms. With time, the Six Ding spirits will arrive. Practice this from dawn until noon.

At the hour of *Renshen* (person’s hour), enter the Weak Waters, ascend Kunlun Mountain, and at midnight, bathe again in the Cinnabar Pool.
