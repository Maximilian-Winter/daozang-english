  "full_translation": "The *Guan Yinzi* states: \"That which is one and universal is the Dao.\"\n\nThe *Guan Yinzi* says: Without the Dao, there can be no speech. That which cannot be spoken is the Dao. Without the Dao, there can be no thought. That which cannot be thought is the Dao.\n\nThe heavens and things surge in tumultuous flow; human affairs are tangled and chaotic. Some whirl like eddies, some clash like grinding blades, some rush about in semblance without substance. Thus, men contend, they take sides, they [○], they clamor, they depart, they demand.\n\nSpeaking of it is like blowing at shadows; thinking of it is like carving dust. The sagely and the wise create delusion; even ghosts and spirits cannot fathom it.\n\nIt cannot be acted upon, cannot be attained, cannot be measured, cannot be divided. Thus, it is called Heaven, Fate, Spirit, and the Origin. Together, these are called the Dao.\n\nIt is said: There is no single thing that is not Heaven, no single thing that is not Fate, no single thing that is not Spirit, no single thing that is not the Origin. Since things are thus, how could humans be otherwise? All people may be called Heaven, all may be called Spirit, all may attain Fate and penetrate the Origin.\n\nOne cannot say that is Heaven and this is not, that is Spirit and this is not, that is Fate and this is not, that is the Origin and this is not.\n\nTherefore, those who master my Dao, within a single thing, know Heaven and exhaust Spirit, attain Fate and create the Origin.\n\nIn learning, one pursues different names while analyzing the same reality. In attainment, one unites with the same reality while forgetting different names.\n\nIt is said: Those who observe the Dao are like those who observe water. If gazing at a mere pond is insufficient, they proceed to rivers, the Yangtze, and the sea, declaring, \"This is the ultimate of water.\" Yet they do not realize that their own saliva, tears, and spittle are all water.\n\nIt is said: The Dao is not partial to any person. The sage does not see that this is the Dao and that is not. The Dao is not partial to any self. The sage does not see that advancing is the Dao and retreating is not.\n\nBecause one does not possess the Dao, one does not lack the Dao. Because one does not grasp the Dao, one does not lose the Dao.\n\nIt is said: Those who do not know the Dao yet recklessly conjecture and divine are like archers shooting at an overturned vessel—ever aiming high.\n\nPreserving gold and jade, one esteems them; preserving horns and feathers, one disdains them; preserving tiles and stones—is this right or not? Only the one who arranges things knows.\n\nIt is said: A single potter can make ten thousand vessels, yet never has a vessel made the potter or harmed the potter. A single Dao can make ten thousand things, yet never has a thing made the Dao or harmed the Dao.\n\nIt is said: Is the Dao vast and unknowing? Is the heart unbound and unrestrained? Are things ceaseless and unerring? Swift as lightning, scattering like sand. The sage knows that heart, thing, and Dao are one. These three again merge into one. One does not constrain the many with the one, nor does the many harm the one.\n\nIt is said: Using a basin as a pond, a stone as an island, fish circle within, unaware that their journey spans thousands of miles without end. Why is this? Water has no source, no return. The sage’s Dao has no beginning, no end, thus it responds to things without exhaustion.\n\nIt is said: Do not love the Dao—love is water. Do not observe the Dao—observation is fire. Do not pursue the Dao—pursuit is wood. Do not speak of the Dao—speech is metal. Do not contemplate the Dao—contemplation is earth. Only the sage, without departing from fundamental nature, ascends the great Dao. When the heart has yet to stir, the Dao borrows from it.\n\nIt is said: Thick clouds veil the sky, rivers and lakes darken; wandering fish drift in confusion. Suddenly, they glimpse a gleam on the waves, food stirring, a gift from heaven, and rush toward it—only to perish by hook or net. Those who lose their self in pursuit of the Dao are no different.\n\nIt is said: The arts and methods in the world are many. Some honor obscurity, some clarity; some strength, some weakness. Clinging to them is mere affair; releasing them is the Dao.\n\nIt is said: The Dao can never be attained. What can be attained is called virtue, not Dao. The Dao can never be practiced. What can be practiced is called conduct, not Dao. The sage uses what can be attained and practiced to nurture life, and what cannot be attained or practiced to nurture death.\n\nIt is said: After hearing the Dao, those who act and cling proceed toward the human; those who neither act nor cling proceed toward heaven. Those who act will fail; those who cling will lose. Thus, one may hear the Dao in the morning and die by evening.\n\nIt is said: Utterly obscure emotion makes the sage; good emotion makes the worthy; evil emotion makes the petty. The utterly obscure emotion arises from inherent nothingness—it cannot be shown. Good and evil emotions arise from nothing to become something—they cannot be concealed. Good and evil emotions belong to the knowing, possessed only by moving creatures. The utterly obscure emotion belongs to the unknowing, pervading all under heaven, for the Dao is nowhere absent.\n\nIt is said: Do not assume the sage’s tireless effort implies the Dao is achieved through diligence. Do not assume the sage’s unwavering steadfastness implies the Dao is attained through grasping. The sage’s effort is like loosing an arrow—it moves by virtue of the other, not by itself. The sage’s steadfastness is like gripping an arrow—it holds by virtue of the other, not by itself.\n\nIt is said: If one seeks the Dao through words, deeds, learning, or knowledge, they turn endlessly without ever attaining it. Knowing words is like the murmur of a spring; knowing deeds is like the flight of birds; knowing learning is like grasping at shadows; knowing knowledge is like interpreting dreams. The moment one ceases to cling, the Dao comes to meet them.\n\nIt is said: To construct things through effort is difficult; to abandon things through the Dao is easy. All things under heaven are not hard to complete but easy to destroy.\n\nIt is said: A single spark can burn ten thousand things, yet when the things perish, where does the fire remain? A single breath of the Dao can obscure ten thousand things, yet when the things vanish, where does the Dao abide?\n\nIt is said: In this world, some die after a single day of life, some after ten years, some after a hundred. Those who die in a day are like those who attain the Dao in a single breath; those who die after ten or a hundred years are like those who attain the Dao after a long passage. Those not yet dead, though active and discerning, are merely called living, not dead. Those not yet united with the Dao, though active and discerning, are merely called occupied with affairs, not with the Dao.\n\nIt is said: Not knowing that my Dao is without words or deeds, one seeks it through words and deeds. Suddenly encountering something strange, they seize it as the Dao, unaware that abandoning the source to seek the stream means never finding the source, or forsaking the root to pursue the branch means never finding the root.\n\nIt is said: In archery, charioteering, lute-playing, or chess, no skill can be mastered in a single breath. Only the Dao, formless and boundless, can be attained in an instant.\n\nIt is said: When two archers meet, skill and clumsiness become apparent. When two chess players meet, victory and defeat become apparent. When two followers of the Dao meet, nothing can be shown. Where nothing can be shown, there is no skill or clumsiness, no victory or defeat.\n\nIt is said: My Dao is like the sea. Toss in a hundred million pieces of gold, and it is not seen. Toss in a hundred million stones, and it is not seen. Toss in a hundred million impurities, and it is not seen. It carries tiny shrimp and small fish, yet also the great *kun* and mighty whale. Gathering all waters, it is not full; dispersing all waters, it is not empty.\n\nIt is said: My Dao is like dwelling in darkness. One in the light cannot see a single thing in the dark, yet one in the dark can see all things in the light.\n\nIt is said: The petty person’s power lies in evil; the noble person’s power lies in good; the sage’s power lies in nothingness. Only in nothingness is the Dao found.\n\nIt is said: My Dao is like a sword. Its edge cuts things and is sharp; grasp its edge, and it wounds.\n\nIt is said: A bamboo basket does not ask the wooden bowl, nor does the bowl answer the basket. A tile does not ask the stone, nor does the stone answer the tile. The Dao is not lost—whether questioning or answering, qi flows back and forth. Where is the Dao?\n\nIt is said: Those who gaze upward at the Dao strain; those who follow the Dao hasten. Both know the affairs of the Dao but not the Dao itself. Thus, the sage does not look to the Dao with regret, nor rely on it for abundance. They do not borrow the Dao from the sage, nor sell it to the foolish.\n\nTwo pillars uphold heaven and earth.\n\nMaster Guan Yin said: Whether a bowl, a basin, a bottle, a pot, a jar, or a vat—all can uphold heaven and earth. Whether cracks on a tortoise shell, stalks of milfoil, broken tiles, or inscribed stones—all can foretell good or ill fortune. Thus, the principles of heaven, earth, and the myriad things are contained within a single thing, and every thing contains them. None borrows from another.\n\nWith my essence, I join their essence; the two essences wrestle, and spirit responds. One female and one male produce eggs; one male and one female produce live young. Form is their essence; principle is their spirit. Love is my essence; observation is my spirit. Love is water; observation is fire. Love clings and observation follows—this is wood. Observation abides and love gathers—this is metal.\n\nFirst, envision the primordial qi within a single thing. Cling to it with love to unite with its form; observe it in darkness to unite with its principle, and the image takes shape. The image of a single movement pervades the great void. From the center, it ascends to become heaven; from the center, it descends to become earth. There is no ascent without descent, no descent without ascent. The ascending is fire; the descending is water. That which wishes to ascend but cannot is wood; that which wishes to descend but cannot is metal.\n\nWood as a thing: drill it to obtain fire; wring it to obtain water. Metal as a thing: strike it to obtain fire; melt it to obtain water. Metal and wood are the intercourse of water and fire. Water is essence and heaven; fire is spirit and earth. Wood is the hun-soul and humanity; metal is the po-soul and things. That which moves without ceasing is time; that which encompasses and abides is direction. Only earth begins and ends it.\n\nThere are those who explain it; there are those who demonstrate it.\n\nIt is said: The people of the world cannot be counted by the hundreds of millions. Each person’s dreams differ; each night’s dreams differ. There are heavens and earths, people and things—all formed by thought. They cannot be counted even by the grains of dust. How then can we know that this present heaven and earth are not formed by some thinking being?\n\nIt is said: The heart responds to the jujube; the liver responds to the elm. I communicate with heaven and earth. When yin prevails, I dream of water; when clarity prevails, I dream of fire. Heaven and earth communicate with me. I and heaven and earth seem conjoined, seem separate—each returning to its own purity.\n\nIt is said: Though heaven and earth are vast, they have color, form, number, and direction. Yet I possess that which is neither color nor form, neither number nor direction, yet through which heaven is heaven and earth is earth.\n\nIt is said: Those who die in the womb, those who die in the egg—whether human or thing—though heaven and earth are vast, they do not reckon them. Heaven and earth are but the constructs of my fleeting perception. It is like a hand not touching the blade, a blade not cutting the person.\n\nIt is said: In dreams, in mirrors, in water—heaven and earth exist therein. To rid oneself of the heaven and earth of dreams, one must not sleep. To rid oneself of the heaven and earth of mirrors, one must not look. To rid oneself of the heaven and earth of water, one must not draw from the vessel. Their being or non-being lies here, not there. Thus the sage does not rid himself of heaven and earth but of perception.\n\nIt is said: Heaven is not heaven of itself; there is that which makes it heaven. Earth is not earth of itself; there is that which makes it earth. It is like houses, boats, and carriages—they await people to complete them. They do not complete themselves. Knowing that they depend on something else, knowing that this does not—above, one sees no heaven; below, one sees no earth; within, one sees no self; without, one sees no others.\n\nIt is said: That which has time is qi. That which is not qi has never known day or night. That which has direction is form. That which is not form has never known south or north.\n\nWhat is meant by \"not qi\"? That from which qi arises is like fanning a fan to obtain wind. Before the fanning, there is no wind-qi. Once fanned, it is called qi.\n\nWhat is meant by \"not form\"? That from which form arises is like drilling wood to obtain fire. Before the drilling, there is no fire-form. Once drilled, it is called form.\n\nIt is said: The changes of cold, heat, warmth, and coolness are like tiles and stones. Placed in fire, they become hot; placed in water, they become cold. Breathed upon, they become warm; blown upon, they become cool. It is only because external things come and go, while the tiles and stones themselves neither come nor go. It is like reflections in water—coming and going—while the water itself neither comes nor goes.\n\nIt is said: Shaking a garment in empty space produces wind; exhaling upon an object produces water. Pouring water into water makes sound; striking stone against stone makes light. One who understands this can produce wind, rain, thunder, and lightning. For wind, rain, thunder, and lightning all arise from qi, and qi arises from the mind. It is like inwardly imagining great fire—after a long time, one feels heat. Inwardly imagining great water—after a long time, one feels cold. One who understands this can share in the virtue of heaven and earth.\n\nIt is said: The transformations of the five clouds can foretell the year’s abundance or scarcity. The arrival of the eight winds can foretell the moment’s fortune or misfortune. Thus, we know that good and ill omens, blessings and disasters, are but the workings of a single qi.\n\nTranscend self and other, unite with heaven and earth—yet those of limited insight claim them as their own. It is said: Heaven and earth are lodged within. The ten thousand things are lodged within. I am lodged within. The Dao is lodged within. If separated from this lodging, the Dao cannot stand.\n\nThe three ultimates are revered in the sage. Guan Yinzi says: The sage’s governance of the world does not depend on my wisdom or folly. Thus, they honor others’ wisdom as wisdom and acknowledge others’ folly as folly. It does not depend on my right or wrong. Thus, they affirm what is right as right and condemn what is wrong as wrong. Knowing the great unity of past and present, they may prioritize the ancient or the modern. Knowing the great unity of inner and outer, they may prioritize the inner or the outer.\n\nThe things of the world cannot burden them, so they ground themselves in humility. The things of the world cannot be externalized, so they embrace them with emptiness. The things of the world cannot be made difficult, so they act with ease. The things of the world cannot be obstructed, so they adapt with flexibility.\n\nBy this, they harmonize the world at its center and establish rites. By this, they bring harmony to the world and create music. By this, they make the world impartial and manage resources. By this, they encompass the world and defend against insult. By this, they follow the world and establish laws. By this, they observe the world and craft tools.\n\nThe sage does not govern the world by the self but governs the world by the world. The world ascribes merit to the sage, yet the sage attributes merit to the world. Thus, in the governance of Yao, Shun, Yu, and Tang, the world all called it natural.\n\nIt is said: Heaven covers all without exception—giving life and taking it—yet heaven harbors no love or hate. The sun shines on all without exception—illuminating beauty and ugliness—yet the sun makes no distinction of favor or disfavor.\n\nIt is said: The sage’s Dao follows the mandate of heaven; the sage does not claim the Dao as their own. The sage’s virtue aligns with the times; the sage does not claim virtue as their own. The sage’s affairs are for others; the sage does not act for themselves. Thus, the sage does not possess the Dao, does not possess virtue, does not possess affairs.\n\nIt is said: The sage knows the self is no-self, so they unite all with benevolence. They know affairs are no-self, so they weigh them with righteousness. They know the mind is no-self, so they restrain it with propriety. They know knowledge is no-self, so they illuminate it with wisdom. They know words are no-self, so they uphold them with trust.\n\nIt is said: The sage’s Dao may take benevolence as benevolence, or righteousness as benevolence, or propriety or trust as benevolence. Benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trust each encompass the other five. The sage unifies them without fixation, and the world cannot name them.\n\nIt is said: Do not observe the sage by their conduct, for the Dao leaves no traces. Do not observe the sage by their words, for the Dao utters no speech. Do not observe the sage by their abilities, for the Dao does nothing. Do not observe the sage by their appearance, for the Dao has no form.\n\nIt is said: Though conduct may be most lofty, it does not escape high and low. Though words may be most impartial, they do not escape right and wrong. Though abilities may be most divine, they do not escape skill and clumsiness. Though appearance may be most distinct, it does not escape beauty and ugliness. The sage borrows these to reveal themselves to the world. The world, obscured by these, only then perceives the sage.\n\nIt is said: The sage learned from bees to establish ruler and subject, from spiders to weave nets and snares, from rats to institute rites, and from warring ants to deploy troops. The common people learn from the worthy; the worthy learn from the sage; the sage learns from the ten thousand things. Only the sage is one with things, and thus has no self.\n\nIt is said: The sage speaks of the Dao, seeing heaven, earth, and all beings as their Dao. They harmonize with it, beginning and ending with it.\n\nThe sage nurtures with green and yellow, shelters as with eggs and wings. They neither cherish the Dao nor discard things, neither honor the noble nor despise the lowly. The worthy call them \"things\"—yet things differ from one another. Day by day they cast some aside, day by day they embrace others. They shorten the long, lengthen the short, straighten the crooked, square the round. This is called \"transforming things.\" Little do they know the sage scorns such杂厕 distinctions, such divisions of rank. This is how they become human—not by making such things their own.\n\nIt is said: Between the sage and the common people, food and drink, clothing, houses, boats and carriages are the same. Wealth and poverty, high and low status are the same. The common people often resemble the sage; the sage often resembles the common people. Those who look up to their loftiness or marvel at their grandeur—is this so? Is this not so?\n\nIt is said: A fish wishing to differ from the school must leap from the water onto the shore, and it dies. A tiger wishing to differ from the pack must leave the mountains for the marketplace, and it is captured. The sage does not differ from the common people—only things cannot confine them.\n\nIt is said: The Dao does nothing. To use the Dao to respond to the world is to treat affairs as the Dao. The Dao has no fixed form. To lodge the Dao in things is to treat things as the Dao. The sage cannot ultimately depart from the Dao to reveal it to others.\n\nIt is said: Like a bell sounding as a bell, like a drum sounding as a drum—such are the sage’s words. Like a cart moving as a cart, like a boat moving as a boat—such are the sage’s actions. None can name them, and so they silence the world’s words. None can know them, and so they seize the world’s wisdom.\n\nIt is said: The centipede eats the snake, the snake eats the frog, the frog eats the centipede—each devours the other. The sage’s words are likewise: they speak of the harm in being, then the harm in non-being, then the harm in neither being nor non-being, then the harm in abandoning neither being nor non-being. Their words move like a saw’s teeth. Only those who truly understand the sage do not cling to a single word.\n\nIt is said: Like the dragon, like the flood-dragon; like the snake, like the tortoise; like the fish, like the clam—all these the dragon can become. The flood-dragon, however, is but a flood-dragon; it cannot become a dragon, nor can it become snake, tortoise, fish, or clam. The sage is as the dragon; the worthy, as the flood-dragon.\n\nIt is said: Abiding nowhere in oneself, the forms of things manifest of themselves. In movement, like water; in stillness, like a mirror; in response, like an echo. Vague, as if absent; silent, as if pure. Those who are alike harmonize; those who grasp lose. Never leading others, yet ever following them.\n\nIt is said: Vast and boundless, roaming the Great Beginning—now refining oneself as gold, now as jade; now as dung, now as earth. Now soaring with things, now pursuing them; now mountain-like, now abyss-like. Upright, adaptable, mad, or foolish.\n\nIt is said: One skilled in the qin: with a sorrowful heart, the sound is mournful; with a pensive heart, the sound is lingering; with a resentful heart, the sound is winding; with a yearning heart, the sound is flowing. Yet what produces sorrow, thought, resentment, or longing is neither the hand, nor the bamboo, nor the silk, nor the paulownia. It arises from the heart and accords with the hand; it arises from the hand and accords with the instrument.\n\nThose who possess the Dao do not deviate from the mean.\n\nIt is said: The sage employs speech, action, and thought to align with others; yet in never speaking, never acting, never thinking, lies the difference from others.\n\nIt is said: The clearer the mind of profit and harm, the less harmony among kin. The clearer the mind of worthiness and folly, the less fellowship among friends. The clearer the mind of right and wrong, the less accomplishment in affairs. The clearer the mind of beauty and ugliness, the less accord with things. Thus the sage blends them all.\n\nIt is said: The world’s fools cling blindly; the sage’s foolishness dissolves of itself. Little do they know that the sage is at times foolish, at times wise; at times clumsy, at times skillful.\n\nIt is said: One who takes the worthy as teacher of the sagely becomes a worthy. One who takes the sage as teacher of the sagely becomes a sage. For one who takes the worthy as teacher of the sagely follows traces and forgets the Dao; one who takes the sage as teacher of the sagely turns from traces to unite with the Dao.\n\nIt is said: The worthy strive upward and see not what is below; the multitude strive downward and see not what is above. The sage encompasses both high and low, acting only as is fitting. How can it be said that apart from the worthy and the multitude there exists another kind of sage?\n\nIt is said: In the principles of the world, the male initiates, the female follows; the stallion gallops, the mare pursues; the cock crows, the hen responds. Thus the sage orders words and deeds, while the worthy are constrained by them.\n\nIt is said: The sage’s Dao may transform like a tiger, yet in affairs it moves like a turtle. The Dao may be as fine as a thread, yet in affairs it spreads like a chessboard.\n\nIt is said: What is called the sage’s Dao—how solitary it is! How penetrating! How majestic! How resplendent! Only by being able to pair with all things while no single thing can pair with it does it become the most noble of all things.\n\nIt is said: The clouds’ coiling and unfurling, the birds’ flight and soaring—all occur within the void, thus their transformations are inexhaustible. Such is the sage’s Dao.\n\nThe four symbols—*spirit, essence, soul, and corporeal soul*—\n\nMaster Guan Yin said: Water can be divided or united; essence has no self. Fire depends on oil or fuel; spirit has no self. Thus the ear, though obstructed front and back, can still hear—no self. Wisdom, though lofty, has no self. The singular and odd have no self. Winter’s withering of autumn’s things has no self. Black cannot be altered—no self. Northern longevity has no self. All these are essence.\n\nThe tongue, teeth, and molars form speech—no self. Ritual, though humble, has no self. The dual and even have no self. Summer’s reliance on spring’s things has no self. Red can be altered—no self. Southern heaven has no self. All these are spirit.\n\nWith essence having no self, rice, when its husk is removed, retains its essence. With spirit having no self, ghosts, when they possess things, reveal their spirit.\n\nOne who preserves essence forgets right and wrong, forgets gain and loss. In this, that is not this. One who embraces spirit is at times obscure, at times bright; at times strong, at times weak. In that, this is not this.\n\nIt is said: Essence and spirit are water and fire. The five phases mutually generate and destroy them. Their coming has no beginning; their going, no end. Thus my essence, a single drop, neither perishes nor remains; my spirit, a single flicker, neither arises nor ceases. Only with no self, no other, no beginning, no end does one merge with heaven and earth.\n\nIt is said: Essence is water; corporeal soul is metal. Spirit is fire; soul is wood. Essence governs water; corporeal soul governs metal. Metal generates water, so essence is stored in corporeal soul. Spirit governs fire; soul governs wood. Wood generates fire, so spirit is stored in soul.\n\nWater as a thing can store metal and still it; can nourish wood and flourish it. Thus it separates soul and corporeal soul. Fire as a thing can melt metal and dissolve it; can burn wood and consume it. Thus it obscures soul and corporeal soul.\n\nEssence: in heaven, it is cold; on earth, it is water; in humans, it is essence. Spirit: in heaven, it is heat; on earth, it is fire; in humans, it is spirit. Corporeal soul: in heaven, it is dryness; on earth, it is metal; in humans, it is corporeal soul. Soul: in heaven, it is wind; on earth, it is wood; in humans, it is soul.\n\nOnly by uniting my essence with the essence of heaven, earth, and the myriad things—like myriad waters merging into one—can this be done. By uniting my spirit with the spirit of heaven, earth, and the myriad things—like myriad fires merging into one—can this be done. By uniting my corporeal soul with the corporeal soul of heaven, earth, and the myriad things—like metals, though different, being smelted into one—can this be done. By uniting my soul with the soul of heaven, earth, and the myriad things—like woods, though different, being grafted into one—can this be done.\n\nThen heaven, earth, and the myriad things are all my essence, my spirit, my corporeal soul, my soul. What is death? What is life?\n\nIt is said: The movement of the five phases depends on essence to have soul, and on soul to have spirit.\n\nThrough spirit arises intention; through intention arises the corporeal soul; through the corporeal soul arises essence. The five phases revolve unceasingly, and thus my false heart circulates through the transformations of creation for billions of years without end. Yet kernels sprout into countless trees—though heaven and earth are vast, they cannot sprout a kernel from empty space. Eggs and roosters beget countless birds—though yin and yang are wondrous, they cannot hatch an egg from a roosterless hen.\n\nOnly that which comes from me can all be gathered in a single breath. Then things are transformed into me, and nothing is not me. Of the so-called five phases, who can alter them?\n\nIt is said: The multitude, by using the corporeal soul to grasp the soul, have excess metal and insufficient wood. The multitude, by using the soul to grasp the corporeal soul, have excess wood and insufficient metal. For the corporeal soul stores the soul and accompanies it; the soul wanders and relies on the corporeal soul. By day, the soul lodges in the eyes; by night, the corporeal soul abides in the liver. Lodging in the eyes enables sight; abiding in the liver enables dreams. What is seen is the soul without discrimination; to discriminate and analyze it as heaven and earth is the soul’s habituation. What is dreamed is the corporeal soul without discrimination; to discriminate and analyze it as self and other is the corporeal soul’s habituation.\n\nFire generates earth, thus spirit generates intention. Earth generates metal, thus intention generates the corporeal soul. When spirit moves, it is no longer called spirit but intention. When intention moves, it is no longer called intention but the corporeal soul. Only the sage knows that I am without self and things are without things—all arise from thought and calculation. Therefore, when the myriad things come, I respond to them with nature, not with the heart. Nature is the heart before it sprouts; without heart, there is no intention. Without fire, there is no earth; without intention, there is no corporeal soul. Without earth, there is no metal. If one is absent, all five collapse.\n\nHaving merged heaven, earth, and the myriad things into my soul, I can then merge heaven, earth, and the myriad things into my corporeal soul. All that creation wondrously produces is my soul; all that creation possesses is my corporeal soul. Then there is not a single thing that can enslave me.\n\n*\"Abiding in the liver\" should read \"abiding in the lung.\"*\n\nIt is said: The character for *hun* (魂, soul) is composed of *gui* (鬼, ghost) and *yun* (云, cloud); the character for *po* (魄, corporeal soul) is composed of *gui* (鬼) and *bai* (白, white). This is so in the script. *Gui* is what a person becomes after death; *yun* is wind, and wind is wood; *bai* is qi, and qi is metal. Wind disperses, thus it is light and pure; what is light and pure ascends to heaven. Metal is hard, thus it is heavy and turbid; what is heavy and turbid descends to earth. What is light and pure is the corporeal soul following the soul in ascent; what is heavy and turbid is the soul following the corporeal soul in descent.\n\nSome ascend through benevolence to become assistants to Jupiter. Some ascend through righteousness to become assistants to Venus. Some ascend through propriety to become assistants to Mars. Some ascend through wisdom to become assistants to Mercury. Some ascend through trustworthiness to become assistants to Saturn.\n\nSome sink through lack of benevolence, and wood destroys them. Some sink through lack of righteousness, and metal destroys them. Some sink through lack of propriety, and fire destroys them. Some sink through lack of wisdom, and water destroys them. Some sink through lack of trustworthiness, and earth destroys them. When soul and corporeal soul are evenly divided, they remain in the human realm.\n\nThe soul’s ascent brings nobility; the corporeal soul’s descent brings baseness. A numinous soul brings worthiness; a vicious corporeal soul brings foolishness. A light soul brings clarity; a heavy corporeal soul brings obscurity. A soaring soul becomes a feather; a dull corporeal soul becomes fur. A luminous soul becomes a spirit; a dark corporeal soul becomes a ghost. Their forms, their dwellings, their perceptions, their preferences—all are thus.\n\nAll things are aligned through the Five Phases. Yet the number five is uneven and inconsistent—hence the boundless multiplicity of the myriad beings filling heaven and earth, never ceasing. The Five Affairs correspond to the Five Phases, and the Five Phases give rise to the Five Creatures—how can one exhaust their enumeration? It is like divining with a tortoise shell or counting with milfoil stalks: when utmost sincerity is present, the Five Phases respond. If sincerity is lacking, even with divination and counting, not one will answer.\n\nThe sage borrows external things to traverse the world, and the Five Phases cannot but respond. It is said: The Five possess souls. The soul is consciousness. The eye is essence. Color is spirit. What sees is the soul. The ears, eyes, mouth, nose, and heart—all that pertains to this life—love is essence, the root of that life’s father. Observation is spirit, the root of that life’s mother. Though love and observation differ, both arise from the same consciousness. The root of that life lies in that which gives life: the first is the father, whence one receives qi—qi is water. The second is the mother, whence one receives blood—blood is fire. With father and mother, that life is born.\n\nYet love without consciousness is like interlocking chains, and observation without consciousness is like a lamp’s illumination. If my consciousness does not stir, how can my life exist? It is said: Like a drumstick striking a drum—the drum’s form is my possession, the drum’s sound is my perception. The stick has departed, yet the lingering resonance remains, though in the end, nothing endures. The drum’s form is like my essence, the drum’s sound like my spirit. The lingering resonance is like the soul and corporeal soul. Knowing that they fleetingly come and go, how can the qi of the Five Phases belong to me?\n\nIt is said: The fruit’s kernel must await the presence of water, fire, and earth—only then can generation continue without end. If these three are incomplete, as in great drought, great flood, or barren clod, none suffice to generate beings. Essence (water), spirit (fire), and intent (earth)—these three do not originally interact. Only when humans unite them through the root can activity arise within. It is like a shaman who perceives manifold events within utter emptiness.\n\nIt is said: The soul is wood. Wood’s roots lie in winter’s water, and it blossoms in summer’s fire. Thus, the human soul is stored in night’s essence and appears in day’s spirit. When united with essence, what is seen is uniquely mine—for essence has never belonged to another. When united with spirit, what is seen is shared by all—for spirit has never belonged to me.\n\nIt is said: Know that this body is like a body in a dream, appearing as emotion dictates—then you may soar with spirit as your self and wander the Great Purity. Know that this thing is like a thing in a dream, appearing as emotion dictates—then you may condense essence into form and traverse the eight wilds. This Dao enables one to perceive spirit and essence and attain long life, or to forget spirit and essence and transcend life.\n\nInhale qi to nourish essence, as metal generates water. Inhale wind to nourish spirit, as wood generates fire. Thus, one borrows the external to extend spirit and essence. Rinse with water to nourish essence, so that essence never exhausts. Rub with fire to nourish spirit, so that spirit never exhausts. Thus, one borrows the internal to extend spirit and essence.\n\nAs for those who forget spirit and essence to transcend life, I have already spoken of this. It is said: One diligent in propriety does not let spirit scatter—thus can gather spirit. One diligent in wisdom does not let essence stray—thus can preserve essence. Benevolence is yang and luminous—thus can lighten the soul. Righteousness is yin and obscure—thus can govern the corporeal soul.\n\nIt is said: The dung beetle rolls its pellet, and through concentrated thought, a wriggling white grub comes to dwell within. Soon, the shell departs, and a cicada emerges. If the beetle did not think, how would the grub become white?\n\nIt is said: A cook stews a crab, leaving one leg upon the table. The crab is already stewed, yet the discarded leg still twitches. This is life and death—nothing more than the gathering and scattering of a single qi. Neither born nor dead, yet people arbitrarily impose the notions of life and death.\n\nIt is said: There are those who die standing, those who die sitting, those who die lying down, those who die of illness, and those who die from medicine. All deaths are equal, without distinction of rank. But the one who understands the Dao does not see life, and thus does not see death.\n\nIt is said: Those who weary of life and death or seek to transcend life and death are all afflicted by the same great delusion. It is like a phantom—if it harbors weariness of life and death or the desire to transcend them, it is called a demon, not the Dao.\n\nIt is said: Those who calculate life and death say either that death leaves something behind, or that death leaves nothing behind, or that death leaves both something and nothing, or that death leaves neither something nor nothing. Some say one should rejoice, some say one should fear, some say one should accept, some say one should transcend. The more their perceptions shift, the more their minds race without cease. They do not realize that my life and death are like a horse’s hand or a cow’s wing—originally non-existent, and yet not even the absence exists. It is like water and fire: though one may violate water and fire, they cannot be burned or drowned.\n\nThe five mirrors are the mind.\nMaster Guan Yin said: The mind obscured by fortune and misfortune is seized by numinous ghosts. The mind obscured by desire for men and women is seized by lustful ghosts. The mind obscured by hidden sorrow is seized by sinking ghosts. The mind obscured by dissipation is seized by mad ghosts. The mind obscured by oaths and curses is seized by strange ghosts. The mind obscured by medicines and elixirs is seized by material ghosts. Such ghosts may take yin as their body, or darkness as their body, or wind as their body, or qi as their body, or clay figurines as their body, or painted images as their body, or old beasts as their body, or broken vessels as their body. Their essence meets with your essence, and when the two essences clash, spirit responds. Those seized by ghosts may interpret omens, or strange events, or auspicious signs. Such people grow arrogant, claiming not that ghosts dwell within them, but that the Dao dwells within them. Over time, they may die by wood, or by metal, or by rope, or by well.\n\nOnly the sage can be spirit-like without being ensnared by spirits, command the myriad things while grasping their mechanism. They can gather them, scatter them, or master them. Daily, they respond to the ten thousand things, yet their mind remains still.\n\nIt is said: Without a unified mind, the five senses race in all directions—the mind cannot be unified. Without an empty mind, the five phases are all present—the mind cannot be empty. Without a still mind, the ten thousand transformations shift imperceptibly—the mind cannot be still. If you force unity, duality arises. If you force emptiness, fullness fills it. If you force stillness, movement stirs it. Only the sage can gather the ten thousand existences into a single breath, so that not one thing can enslave their clarity. They can scatter a single breath into the ten thousand existences, so that not one thing can interrupt their cloud-like actions.\n\nIt is said: A fire of a thousand years can suddenly be extinguished; a consciousness of a thousand years can suddenly be dispelled.\n\nIt is said: The floating is the boat, but what makes it float is the water, not the boat. The moving is the cart, but what makes it move is the ox, not the cart. The thinking is the mind, but what makes it think is intention, not the mind. Not knowing why it is so, yet it is so. Only by not knowing why it is so can its coming have no source, its going no place. Its coming has no source, its going no place—thus it can unite with the original source of heaven and earth, neither ancient nor modern.\n\nIt is said: Know that the mind is without thing, and you will know that things are without thing. Know that things are without thing, and you will know that the Dao is without thing. Know that the Dao is without thing, and thus you will neither follow extraordinary conduct nor marvel at subtle words.\n\nIt is said: When things and self interact, the mind arises. When two pieces of wood rub, fire arises. You cannot say it is in me, nor in the other; you cannot say it is not in me, nor not in the other. To cling to distinctions of self and other is foolishness.\n\nIt is said: Do not rely on what you call benefit and harm, right and wrong. Are what you call benefit and harm, right and wrong truly benefit and harm, right and wrong? The sage does not even recognize or know—how much less can you?\n\nIt is said: The dreams of the night may last longer than the night itself. When the mind arises in Qi, all it sees is the state of Qi. Then, traveling to Song, to Chu, to Jin, to Liang—what the mind holds differs each time, for the mind has no fixed direction.\n\nIt is said: The master archer learns from the bow, not from Yi. The master boatman learns from the boat, not from [the legendary sailor]. The master of the mind learns from the mind, not from the sages.\n\nIt is said: Right and wrong, beauty and ugliness, success and failure, fullness and emptiness—these are set in motion by the Maker of Things. All arise from clinging to private perceptions. Thus, even when you dismiss them as nothing, they remain. Even when you dismiss them as neither existent nor non-existent, they remain. Whether you call them obscure or undifferentiated, they remain. It is like revisiting a place you once traveled: the memory is vivid. This cannot be forgotten, cannot be dismissed. The one who skillfully dissolves perception transforms perception into wisdom. Do you understand this teaching of transforming perception into wisdom?\n\nIt is said: Thoughts are like imagining ghosts—when the mind trembles at the thought of thieves, fear arises, and this is perception. It is like mistaking millet for sorghum, or jade for stone. Floating and formless, it has no fixed abode. As when seeing a strange thing, one conceives a strange thought, and from that thought arises strange perception. This thought, this perception—its root is not in me. It is like today: today alone exists. As for tomorrow, thoughts and perceptions are yet unpredictable. When tomorrow comes, the swirling thoughts and perceptions all arise from existence.\n\nIt is said: Like the rhinoceros gazing at the moon, the moon’s form appears in its horn—this is solely due to perception. Only then does the moon’s form exist, yet the true moon was never in the horn. The myriad things of heaven and earth within the breast are likewise. One who understands this teaching sees nothing outside as objects, nothing inside as emotions.\n\nIt is said: Things arise from earth and ultimately return to earth. Affairs arise from intention and ultimately return to intention. Know that it is intention alone that suddenly affirms, suddenly denies, suddenly deems good, suddenly deems bad. Intention changes, but the mind does not change. Intention is aware, but the mind is not aware. Only my single mind exists—then intention is but dust passing to and fro, and affairs are but fleeting apparitions. My mind holds what is eternally constant.\n\nIt is said: Emotions arise from the mind, and the mind arises from nature. Emotions are waves, the mind is the current, and nature is the water. What comes to assail me is like a spark from striking stone. If nature receives it, then the mind does not arise, and things float lightly away.\n\nIt is said: Of worthiness and foolishness, truth and falsity, some perceive them, some do not. Though there may be worthiness and foolishness, though there may be truth and falsity, what we call worthiness and foolishness, truth and falsity—these are tied to my perception. Knowing that all are formed by perception, even what is true is treated as false.\n\nIt is said: When the mind responds to things, it does not give rise to the mind but to emotions. When things interact with the mind, they do not give rise to things but to perception. Things are not even real—how much less perception? Perception is not even real—how much less emotions? Yet deluded people, in the midst of utter nothingness, cling to it as something. In the midst of constant change, they cling to it as constant. Grasping one emotion, they accumulate ten thousand emotions. Grasping ten thousand emotions, they accumulate ten thousand things. Things come endlessly, but my mind has its limits. Thus, my good mind is controlled by emotions, and my fundamental emotions are controlled by things. They can be made to depart, they can be made to arrive, yet their coming and going was never in my power. Creation enslaves them without cease. Little do they know that though heaven and earth are vast, they can enslave the formed but cannot enslave the formless. Though yin and yang are subtle, they can enslave the qi-endowed but cannot enslave the qi-less. Where the mind goes, qi follows. Where qi goes, form responds. It is like the great void transforming into the myriad things within a single bowl, yet that bowl is not called the great void. My single mind can transform into qi, can transform into form, yet my mind is without qi, without form. Know that my single mind is without qi, without form, and then heaven and earth, yin and yang cannot enslave it.\n\nIt is said: When a person in ordinary times suddenly sees an extraordinary thing, it is because essence has congealed to make it so. When a person in illness suddenly sees an extraordinary thing, it is because the mind has some deficiency to make it so. If you know that my mind can manifest existence from nothingness, then you know that my mind can manifest nothingness from existence. But if you do not believe it, it will naturally not be numinous. Some say: When perception is already obscured, who can avoid believing it? I reply: Like the snake-catcher who does not fear snakes, though he dreams of snakes, he does not feel dread.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said: The Dao has no ghosts or spirits, it comes and goes alone.\n\nIt is said: My thoughts and concerns change daily—something makes them do so, and it is not I. It is fate. If you know it is only fate, then outwardly you see no self, inwardly you see no mind.\n\nIt is said: Like two eyes that can see the myriad things of heaven and earth, if they briefly turn their light away, they see nothing for a time.\n\nIt is said: The eye that gazes at carvings becomes more injured the sharper it is. The ear that hears intricate sounds becomes more injured the keener it is. The mind that ponders the profound becomes more injured the deeper it goes.\n\nIt is said: Do not measure others with your own mind; rather, measure others with their own minds. One who understands this teaching can manage affairs, cultivate virtue, penetrate the Dao, interact with others, and forget the self.\n\nIt is said: The principles of the world begin with small things that are not controlled, leading to great things, and great things that are not controlled, leading to the uncontrollable. Thus, one who can control a single emotion can perfect virtue. One who can forget a single emotion can align with the Dao.\n\nSix *bi* spoons are for eating, and eating is for the body.\n\nMaster Guan Yin said: People of the world distinguish between \"my thoughts\" and \"their thoughts,\" \"their thoughts\" and \"my thoughts,\" dividing self and other. Little do they know that in dreams, \"my thoughts\" also differ from \"their thoughts,\" and \"their thoughts\" differ from \"my thoughts.\" Who then is self, and who is other? People of the world distinguish between \"my pain\" and \"their pain,\" \"their pain\" and \"my pain,\" dividing self and other.\n\nLittle do they know that in dreams, \"my pain\" also differs from \"their pain,\" and \"their pain\" differs from \"my pain.\" Who then is self, and who is other? Nails and hair do not feel pain; hands and feet do not think. Yet they are also part of me. How can one distinguish self and other by thoughts and pains?\n\nPeople of the world regard solitary visions as dreams and shared visions as wakefulness. Little do they know that when essence congeals, there are those who see alone even in daylight; when spirits unite, there are those who share dreams even at night. Both arise from my spirit—who then can say which is dream and which is wakefulness?\n\nPeople of the world regard fleeting visions as dreams and enduring visions as wakefulness. Little do they know that what is seen fleetingly is but a vessel of yin and yang, and what is seen enduringly is also a vessel of yin and yang. Both arise from my yin and yang—who then can say which is dream and which is wakefulness?\n\nIt is said: Those who favor benevolence often dream of pines and cypresses, peaches and plums. Those who favor righteousness often dream of weapons, blades, gold, and iron. Those who favor propriety often dream of ritual vessels. Those who favor wisdom often dream of rivers, lakes, streams, and marshes. Those who favor trustworthiness often dream of mountains, peaks, plains, and fields. Governed by the Five Phases, there is no exception. Yet in dreams, one may hear of certain matters or think of certain things, and the dream shifts accordingly. The Five Phases cannot be rigidly confined.\n\nThe sage governs things with the heart and restrains the heart with nature. Then the heart aligns with the transformations of creation, and the Five Phases cannot be rigidly confined.\n\nIt is said: If you see one with the head of a serpent and the body of a man, or the arms of an ox and the scales of a fish, or the form of a ghost and the wings of a bird, do not be startled. Such marvels are not as strange as dreams, and dreams are not as strange as wakefulness. Having ears, eyes, hands, and arms—how much stranger still! Great words cannot be spoken; great wisdom cannot be thought.\n\nIt is said: If someone asks me, \"What is your clan? What is your surname? What is your name? What is your courtesy name? What do you eat? What do you wear? Who are your friends? Who are your servants? What zither do you play? What books do you read? What is ancient? What is modern?\"\n\nAt that moment, I remained silent, not uttering a single word. When the questioner persisted without cease, I could not but respond, saying: \"You do not even see me—what then could be mine?\"\n\nIt is said: Form may divide or unite, extend or conceal. One man and one woman may bear two children—form may divide. One man and one woman, two persons forming one child—form may unite. Consuming sesame grants longevity—form may extend. On a moonless night without fire, no one sees me—form may conceal.\n\nWith one bowl, a myriad things are born, just as discarded hair may be exchanged—thus form divides. With one bowl, a myriad things are gathered, just as a broken lip may be mended—thus form unites. By spirit preserving the bowl, and the bowl preserving form—thus form extends. Uniting form with spirit, and spirit with nothingness—thus form conceals.\n\nDo you wish to know this? Do you wish to practice this?\n\nIt is said: There is nothing that cannot be seen—then nothing is not my seeing. There is nothing that cannot be heard—then nothing is not my hearing. The Five Phases may nourish form—then nothing is not my form. The five flavors may nourish qi—then nothing is not my qi. Thus, my form and qi are the ten thousand things of heaven and earth.\n\nIt is said: The plowman, accustomed to oxen, grows coarse. The hunter, accustomed to tigers, grows bold. The fisherman, accustomed to water, grows deep. The warrior, accustomed to horses, grows strong. The myriad things may become me—my single body.\n\nWithin, pinworms and roundworms transform; without, lice and fleas steam. Accumulations become tortoises and fish; hollows become rats and ants. I may become the ten thousand things.\n\nIt is said: My self as myself is like gold in ashes—yet not so fine as gold in ore. Break the ore to obtain gold; pan the sand to obtain gold. But those who winnow ashes all their lives find no gold.\n\nIt is said: A single bee, though minute, may wander and observe heaven and earth. A single shrimp, though minute, may roam wantonly in the great sea.\n\nIt is said: When clay figurines are formed, some are noble, some base, some male, some female—yet their substance is earth, and when broken, they return to earth. Are they still human?\n\nIt is said: The eye sees itself—yet there is no color. The ear hears itself—yet there is no sound. The tongue tastes itself—yet there is no flavor. The heart measures itself—yet there is no thing. The multitude chase after externals; the worthy grasp within; the sage treats all as false.\n\nIt is said: My body is the bowl of the Five Phases, and the bowl of the Five Phases—its nature is one thing. For example, a single place may draw water, may draw fire, may grow wood, may congeal metal, may transform earth. Its nature contains and embraces all—fundamentally without difference.\n\nThus when creatures of feathers flourish, those of fur do not thrive; when creatures of fur flourish, those of scales do not thrive. One who understands the mutual functioning of the Five Phases may forget the self.\n\nIt is said: A withered tortoise shell, though selfless, can reveal great wisdom. A lodestone, though selfless, can reveal great power. Bells and drums, though selfless, can reveal great sound. Boats and carts, though selfless, can reveal far-reaching movement. Thus this body of mine, though possessing wisdom, power, movement, and sound, has never possessed a self.\n\nIt is said: The archer insect’s shadow can slay me—knowing that the one who knows not is also myself. Then beneath the vast heavens, there is nowhere I am not.\n\nIt is said: One whose heart is lost in recollection forgets hunger. One whose heart is consumed by anger forgets cold. One whose heart is nurtured forgets illness. One whose heart is stirred forgets pain. If one draws from the bowl to cultivate harmony, who can hunger? If one preserves spirit to nourish warmth, who can chill? If one nurtures the Five Viscera with the Five Phases, there is no injury—who then can sicken? If one returns the Five Viscera to the Five Phases, there is no knowing—who then can cause pain?\n\nIt is said: People take the state of no-knowing and no-doing as having no self. Yet even with knowing and doing, it does not harm their being selfless. For example, fire—though restless and ceaseless in motion—has never possessed a self.\n\nThe seven cauldrons are transformations.\n\nMaster Guan Yin says: The Dao is fundamentally the utmost nonbeing. Those who return affairs to the Dao attain it in a single breath. Affairs are fundamentally the utmost being. Those who move affairs with the Dao encompass a hundred deeds. Those who attain the Dao’s honor may assist the world. Those who attain the Dao’s solitude may establish the self. Those who know the Dao is not bound by time may make a single day into a hundred years, or a hundred years into a single day. Those who know the Dao is not hindered by place may make a single li into a hundred li, or a hundred li into a single li. Those who know the formless can move the formed may summon wind and rain. Those who know the qi-less can transform the qi-possessing may alter birds and beasts. Those who attain the Dao’s purity are unburdened by things—their bodies become light, and they may ride phoenixes and cranes. Those who attain the Dao’s wholeness are undrowned by things.\n\nThe body becomes profound—one may ride upon dragons and whales. Being is nonbeing; nonbeing is being. Those who know this Dao may command ghosts and spirits. Substance is emptiness; emptiness is substance. Those who know this Dao may enter metal and stone. Above is below; below is above. Those who know this Dao may attend the stars. Past is present; present is past. Those who know this Dao may divine with tortoise and milfoil. Others are myself; myself is others. Those who know this Dao may peer into the lungs and liver of others. Things are myself; myself is things. Those who know this Dao may cultivate dragons and tigers within the belly.\n\nKnowing that images arise from the heart’s transformation, by observing the heart one may become a female infant. Knowing that qi arises from the heart’s generation, by absorbing spirit one may become a furnace. By this, one may overcome things—tigers and leopards may be tamed. By this, one may unite with things—water and fire may be entered. Only those who possess the Dao can do these things, yet they may also be capable of them without acting.\n\nIt is said: Human power can seize the transformations of Heaven and Earth. In winter, thunder may arise; in summer, frost may form. A corpse may walk; a withered tree may bloom. Ghosts may be summoned within beans; fish may be hooked in a cup. A painted door may open; a clay ghost may speak. All these are the work of pure qi. Thus, one may transform the myriad things.\n\nNow, the ceaseless flux of human emotions is also the work of qi. Yet qi as a thing has convergence and dispersion. That by which I move qi has never converged, nor has it ever dispersed. Convergence gives rise to life; dispersion brings death. That which has never converged nor dispersed is without life or death. Guests come and go, yet the inn remains unchanged.\n\nIt is said: There are those who recite incantations, those who serve spirits, those who use written talismans, and those who transform with finger gestures—all may employ spirits and command qi to transform the myriad things. Yet those lacking sincerity find it difficult to trust themselves and easy to trust external things, so they rely on these methods. If one knows only sincerity, there is no need to wait for such means to achieve the same.\n\nIt is said: With each breath, a person traverses four hundred thousand li—transformation may indeed be swift. Only the sage remains unmoved and unchanged.\n\nIt is said: The Azure Simurgh lives a thousand years, and after a thousand years, it transforms. The peach tree serves five lords, and its heart transforms five times. The sage dismisses affairs and departs from things—how could they not wish to establish themselves in the world? Those bound by form and number fear the unknowable nature of transformation.\n\nIt is said: Though the myriad things shift and change, appearing and disappearing, their qi is one and the same. Only the sage knows the One and does not transform.\n\nIt is said: The growth of nails, the lengthening of hair, the circulation of nourishing and defending qi—none ceases for even a moment. The common see these changes in the manifest but cannot perceive them in the subtle. The worthy perceive them in the subtle but cannot yield to transformation. The sage yields to transformation, and thus remains without transformation.\n\nIt is said: Within a chamber, one’s perceptions are constant. Yet stepping through the gate, to the neighbor, the village, the district, then to the outskirts, the mountains, the rivers—perceptions differ, likes and dislikes follow, harmony and contention arise, gain and loss take shape. Thus, the sage moves and rests with caution.\n\nIt is said: Like the great sea, which transforms countless dragons and fish, its water remains one. I and the myriad things flourish abundantly within the great transformation—our nature is one and the same. Those who know this unity of nature transcend self and other, life and death.\n\nIt is said: In the world, right may transform into wrong, wrong into right; kindness into enmity, enmity into kindness. Thus, the sage dwells in constancy yet contemplates change.\n\nIt is said: In youth, one should heed the teachings of parents and elders. In maturity, one should grasp the admonitions of friends. In old age, one should be warned by the words of the young and strong. Though the myriad transformations shift, they cannot constrain me.\n\nIt is said: In the world, the light is easily transformed, the heavy is difficult to change. Like wind and clouds, which vanish in an instant, the nature of gold and jade endures unchanged for ages. Those who are light and bright may transform with creation without lingering—yet something untransformed remains within.\n\nIt is said: Two children may be close, yet in maturity, they meet as strangers. Two adults may be close, yet in old age, they meet as strangers. Like the transformations of sparrows, pigeons, hawks, and turtledoves, there is no past, no present.\n\nThe Eight Strategies are things of the world.\n\nMaster Guan Yin said: Those of old skilled in divining with milfoil and scorching tortoise shells could reveal the ancient within the present, the present within the ancient; the high within the low, the low within the high; the small within the great, the great within the small; the one within the many, the many within the one; the human within things, things within the human; the self within the other, the other within the self. This is the Dao.\n\nIts coming has no present, its going has no past. Its height has no canopy, its depth has no foundation. Its greatness has no exterior, its smallness has no interior. Beyond it, no things exist; within it, no person resides. Its nearness has no self, its distance has no other. It cannot be divided, cannot be united, cannot be described, cannot be pondered. Only in its undifferentiated wholeness does it become the Dao.\n\nIt is said: Water sinks, thus congealing into the five essences. Fire soars, thus dispersing into the five odors. Wood flourishes, thus blooming into the five colors. Metal hardens, thus solidifying into the five sounds. Earth harmonizes, thus nurturing into the five flavors. Though constant in five, their transformations are beyond reckoning. Though things are five, their combinations are beyond reckoning.\n\nThus, the myriad things between heaven and earth cannot be rigidly called ten thousand, nor rigidly called five, nor rigidly called one; nor can they be rigidly called not ten thousand, not five, not one. Some unite, some separate—through this, form is necessarily determined; through this, number is necessarily fixed; through this, qi is necessarily manifest. Yet all is but vain labor. Things do not know me, and I do not know things.\n\nIt is said: Within my heart, the myriad things may arise. For where the heart directs, love follows; where love follows, essence follows. Where the heart knots, it first congeals into water. The heart’s longing produces the drool of things; the heart’s sorrow produces the tears of things; the heart’s shame produces the sweat of things. There is no moment that does not endure, no endurance that does not change.\n\nWater generates wood, wood generates fire, fire generates earth, earth generates metal, metal generates water. They attack and overcome one another—beyond all reckoning.\n\nThe Infant and the Maiden, the Golden Tower and the Crimson Palace, the Azure Dragon and the White Tiger, the Jeweled Tripod and the Scarlet Furnace—all are this thing. Yet there is that which exists beyond this thing.\n\nIt is said: Beasts may suddenly cry *yōu-yōu*, then *xún-xún*, then flee in terror. Plants may suddenly sprout *zhuó-zhuó*, then stand *tíng-tíng*, then wither *xiāo-xiāo*. Heaven and earth cannot retain them; the sage cannot bind them. Only that which moves endures.\n\nThere is existence in that; there is nonexistence in this. A drum does not sound without a drumstick. Evenness lies in that; oddness lies in this. A drumstick does not strike without a hand.\n\nIt is said: All is one thing. The multitude are deluded by names—they see things but not the Dao. The worthy analyze principles—they see the Dao but not things. The sage unites with heaven—they see neither Dao nor things. The Dao is wholly Dao. Not grasping it is the Dao; grasping it is a thing.\n\nIt is said: One who knows the falsity of things need not reject them. For example, seeing an earthen ox or a wooden horse, though the name of ox or horse lingers in the mind, the reality of ox or horse is forgotten.\n\nThe Nine Medicines are a compound remedy.\n\nMaster Guan Yin said: Do not slight small matters—a tiny crack sinks a boat. Do not slight small things—a tiny insect poisons the body. Do not slight small men—a petty man betrays the state. Only by attending to small matters can one accomplish great ones. Only by accumulating small things can one achieve great ones. Only by befriending small men can one unite with great ones.\n\nHeaven cannot be certain of man; man cannot be certain of affairs. Only by distancing oneself from affairs and separating from others does the self remain in the self. Only what is fitting is fitting—there is no fixed rule for simplicity or complexity, for restraint or patience, for diligence or indolence.\n\nIt is said: The height of wisdom is knowing that wisdom is insufficient to encompass all things—thus, one becomes foolish. The height of eloquence is knowing that eloquence is insufficient to express all things—thus, one becomes speechless. The height of courage is knowing that courage is insufficient to overcome all things—thus, one becomes timid.\n\nIt is said: Among heaven and earth’s myriad things, not one is mine. Things are not me—they cannot but respond. I am not me—I cannot but nurture myself. Though responding to things, there are no things. Though nurturing myself, there is no self. Do not say “external things” and thereby externalize the self. Do not say “external form” and thereby externalize the heart. The Dao is one and alone—it cannot be ordered in progression.\n\nIt is said: One who scrutinizes the tip of a hair does not see the vastness of heaven and earth. One who listens closely to faint sounds does not hear the crash of thunder. Seeing the great, one does not see the small. Seeing the near, one does not see the far. Hearing the great, one does not hear the small. Hearing the near, one does not hear the far. The sage sees nothing—thus, nothing is unseen. Hears nothing—thus, nothing is unheard.\n\nIt is said: The eye sees countless things—some love gold, some love jade. This is grasping one color for the eye. The ear hears countless things—some love bells, some love drums. This is grasping one sound for the ear. Only the sage neither craves nor rejects, neither dwells nor departs.\n\nIt is said: One who excels in the present can practice the ancient. One who excels in the branch can establish the root.\n\nIt is said: The cunning outwit thieves—thus, they can capture thieves. The brave overpower tigers—thus, they can capture tigers. Only by overcoming the self can one perfect the self. Only by overcoming things can one benefit things. Only by forgetting the Dao can one possess the Dao.\n\nIt is said: If rigid, things will surely break it—hardness invites fracture. If sharp, things will surely shatter it—keenness invites blunting. The sacred phoenix is revered for its rarity—thus, the sage takes depth as the root. The fleeing musk deer leaves its fragrance uncaught—thus, the sage takes restraint as the principle.\n\nIt is said: A jar has two holes. Fill it with water and invert it—if one hole is blocked, the water does not flow out. For it does not rise if it does not descend. Though a well be a thousand fathoms deep, drawing water brings it up. For it does not descend if it does not rise. Thus, the sage does not precede things.\n\nIt is said: When a man errs, though he suffers harm after the mistake, in time, he secretly criticizes himself before the error. Only by not relying on one’s own wisdom but embracing others’ wisdom, only by having no self but embracing the world’s selves, can one walk through life without fault.\n\nIt is said: The customs of past and present differ; the customs of east, west, south, and north differ further. Even the virtues of a single family or person differ. How could I cling to one pattern to constrain later ages? Only by following the times and conforming to customs, acting before the moment and after the event, relinquishing anger and restraining desire, simplifying things and forgiving others, weighing their importance and acting naturally—thus, one merges with the unfathomable and unites with the Dao without fixed method.\n\nIt is said: There are those who unite through the Dao, through virtue, or through affairs. Those who unite through the Dao are like father and son—they stand beyond right and wrong, worthy and unworthy, and thus endure. Those who unite through virtue enter into right and wrong, worthy and unworthy—thus, they may unite or part. Those who unite through affairs part when they unite.\n\nIt is said: Do not dismiss clumsiness—Dao’s essence delights in agility. Do not dismiss ignorance—Dao’s obscurity delights in clarity. Do not dismiss arrogance—Dao’s loftiness delights in harmony. Do not dismiss dissipation—Dao’s vastness delights in focus. Do not dismiss melancholy—Dao’s stillness delights in joy.\n\nThe ancients’ words, when studied excessively, breed many faults—one must remedy them.\n\nIt is said: Do not condemn the world and praise oneself. Do not belittle others and exalt oneself. Do not take the Dao lightly and neglect oneself. Do not slander virtue and disparage oneself. Do not despise talent and debase oneself.\n\nIt is said: To confound the world’s wise, it is not in wisdom but in foolishness. To exhaust the world’s eloquent, it is not in eloquence but in speechlessness. To subdue the world’s brave, it is not in courage but in timidity.\n\nIt is said: Heaven cannot make winter lotuses or spring chrysanthemums—thus, the sage does not defy the seasons. Earth cannot make oranges from Lu grow in Wen or raccoon dogs from Wen grow in Lu.\n\nThus, the sage does not defy custom.\nThe sage cannot make hands walk or feet grasp—\ntherefore, the sage does not defy one’s own strengths.\nThe sage cannot make fish fly or birds gallop—\ntherefore, the sage does not defy others’ strengths.\nSuch being so,\none may act or halt,\nmay conceal or reveal,\nonly—one must not be constrained.\nThis is the Way.\n\nIt is said:\nThose who speak little are not resented by others.\nThose who act little are not found wanting by others.\nThose with little cunning are not wearied by others.\nThose with few abilities are not enslaved by others.\n\nIt is said:\nHold to sincerity,\nproceed with simplicity,\ntreat others with forbearance,\nrespond with silence.\nThus, one’s Dao never falters.\n\nIt is said:\nPlan according to the matter,\ndecide by principle,\nact through others,\nsucceed through Heaven.\nIn affairs, follow the present;\nin principle, follow the ancients.\nIn affairs, align with others;\nin Dao, stand alone.\n\nIt is said:\nGold and jade are hard to relinquish,\nearth and stone easy to discard.\nThose who study the Dao,\nwhen encountering subtle words or wondrous conduct,\nmust not cling to them.\nThese may be practiced but not clung to.\nShould one cling to them,\nthey become ailments of the heart and mind,\nno medicine can cure.\n\nIt is said:\nThose who do not understand urgent matters\nbut pursue many affairs, other affairs, or strange affairs—\nmisfortune and distress will befall them.\nThey do not know the Dao is in all things,\none cannot abandon this to seek that.\n\nIt is said:\nIn the world’s principles,\nto forsake the close for the distant,\nthe root for the branch,\nthe worthy for the foolish,\nthe near for the far—\nis permissible only briefly.\nProlonged, harm arises.\n\nIt is said:\nOf those who once discoursed on the Dao,\nsome called it serene stillness,\nsome called it profound depth,\nsome called it limpid clarity,\nsome called it empty vastness,\nsome called it obscure darkness.\nBeware—do not, upon hearing these,\ngrow fearful and retreat.\nThe world’s supreme principle\nultimately transcends words and meaning.\nIf one knows it is neither word nor meaning,\nbut lies beyond those subtle words and wondrous meanings—\nonly then does one accord with my teaching.\n\nIt is said:\nThe sage’s grand words are gold and jade,\ntheir small words are platycodon and *Plantago*.\nUsed rightly, platycodon and *Plantago* give life;\nused wrongly, gold and jade bring death.\n\nIt is said:\nWhen speaking of a certain matter,\nPerson A calls it beneficial,\nPerson B calls it harmful,\nPerson C calls it sometimes beneficial, sometimes harmful,\nPerson D calls it both beneficial and harmful.\nOne must fall into one of these.\nYet those who speak of the Dao say nothing.\nThey say:\nMatters exist,\nmatters spoken have principles.\nThe Dao has no existence,\nthe Dao spoken has no principles.\nKnow that spoken principles do not exist,\nand every word is the Dao.\nNot knowing that spoken principles do not exist,\neven grasping the most perfect words\nbecomes an obstruction, a veil.\n\nIt is said:\nTo disbelieve a fool is easy,\nto disbelieve a worthy one is hard.\nTo disbelieve a worthy one is easy,\nto disbelieve a sage is hard.\nTo disbelieve one sage is easy,\nto disbelieve a thousand sages is hard.\nThose who disbelieve a thousand sages\nsee no others without,\nsee no self within,\nsee no Dao above,\nsee no matters below.\n\nIt is said:\nThe sage’s words are hazy,\nto make people deaf.\nThe sage’s words are dark,\nto make people blind.\nThe sage’s words are deep,\nto make people mute.\nOnly the deaf do not hear sounds,\nonly the blind do not see forms,\nonly the mute do not utter words.\nThose who do not hear sounds\ndo not hear the Dao,\ndo not hear matters,\ndo not hear the self.\nThose who do not see forms\ndo not see the Dao,\ndo not see matters,\ndo not see the self.\nThose who do not utter words\ndo not speak of the Dao,\ndo not speak of matters,\ndo not speak of the self.\n\nIt is said:\nPeople merely know that within false gains there are true losses,\nyet do not know that within true gains there are true losses.\nThey merely know that within false affirmations there are true negations,\nyet do not know that within true affirmations there are true negations.\n\nIt is said:\nSpeaking of the Dao is like speaking of dreams.\nThose who speak of dreams say:\nsuch gold and jade,\nsuch vessels and utensils,\nsuch birds and beasts.\nThe speaker can describe them,\nbut cannot take and give them.\nThe listener can hear them,\nbut cannot receive and obtain them.\nOnly the good listener\nneither clings nor disputes.\n\nIt is said:\nLet your Dao be round,\nlet your virtue be square,\nlet your conduct be level,\nlet your affairs be sharp.",

That which cannot be spoken is the Dao. Without the Dao, there can be no thought. That which cannot be thought is the Dao.\n\nThe heavens and things surge in tumultuous flow; human affairs are tangled and chaotic. Some whirl like eddies, some clash like grinding blades, some rush about in semblance without substance.

All people may be called Heaven, all may be called Spirit, all may attain Fate and penetrate the Origin.\n\nOne cannot say that is Heaven and this is not, that is Spirit and this is not, that is Fate and this is not, that is the Origin and this is not.\n\nTherefore, those who master my Dao, within a single thing, know Heaven and exhaust Spirit, attain Fate and create the Origin.\n\nIn learning, one pursues different names while analyzing the same reality.

A single Dao can make ten thousand things, yet never has a thing made the Dao or harmed the Dao.\n\nIt is said: Is the Dao vast and unknowing? Is the heart unbound and unrestrained? Are things ceaseless and unerring? Swift as lightning, scattering like sand. The sage knows that heart, thing, and Dao are one. These three again merge into one. One does not constrain the many with the one, nor does the many harm the one.\n\nIt is said: Using a basin as a pond, a stone as an island, fish circle within, unaware that their journey spans thousands of miles without end. Why is this? Water has no source, no return. The sage’s Dao has no beginning, no end, thus it responds to things without exhaustion.\n\nIt is said: Do not love the Dao—love is water. Do not observe the Dao—observation is fire. Do not pursue the Dao—pursuit is wood. Do not speak of the Dao—speech is metal. Do not contemplate the Dao—contemplation is earth. Only the sage, without departing from fundamental nature, ascends the great Dao. When the heart has yet to stir, the Dao borrows from it.\n\nIt is said: Thick clouds veil the sky, rivers and lakes darken; wandering fish drift in confusion. Suddenly, they glimpse a gleam on the waves, food stirring, a gift from heaven, and rush toward it—only to perish by hook or net. Those who lose their self in pursuit of the Dao are no different.\n\nIt is said: The arts and methods in the world are many. Some honor obscurity, some clarity; some strength, some weakness. Clinging to them is mere affair; releasing them is the Dao.\n\nIt is said: The Dao can never be attained. What can be attained is called virtue, not Dao. The Dao can never be practiced. What can be practiced is called conduct, not Dao. The sage uses what can be attained and practiced to nurture life, and what cannot be attained or practiced to nurture death.\n\nIt is said: After hearing the Dao, those who act and cling proceed toward the human; those who neither act nor cling proceed toward heaven. Those who act will fail; those who cling will lose. Thus, one may hear the Dao in the morning and die by evening.\n\nIt is said: Utterly obscure emotion makes the sage; good emotion makes the worthy; evil emotion makes the petty.

      "translated_text": "It is said: Do not assume the sage’s tireless effort implies the Dao is achieved through diligence. Do not assume the sage’s unwavering steadfastness implies the Dao is attained through grasping. The sage’s effort is like loosing an arrow—it moves by virtue of the other, not by itself. The sage’s steadfastness is like gripping an arrow—it holds by virtue of the other, not by itself.\n\nIt is said: If one seeks the Dao through words, deeds, learning, or knowledge, they turn endlessly without ever attaining it. Knowing words is like the murmur of a spring; knowing deeds is like the flight of birds; knowing learning is like grasping at shadows; knowing knowledge is like interpreting dreams. The moment one ceases to cling, the Dao comes to meet them.\n\nIt is said: To construct things through effort is difficult; to abandon things through the Dao is easy. All things under heaven are not hard to complete but easy to destroy.\n\nIt is said: A single spark can burn ten thousand things, yet when the things perish, where does the fire remain? A single breath of the Dao can obscure ten thousand things, yet when the things vanish, where does the Dao abide?\n\nIt is said: In this world, some die after a single day of life, some after ten years, some after a hundred. Those who die in a day are like those who attain the Dao in a single breath; those who die after ten or a hundred years are like those who attain the Dao after a long passage. Those not yet dead, though active and discerning, are merely called living, not dead. Those not yet united with the Dao, though active and discerning, are merely called occupied with affairs, not with the Dao.\n\nIt is said: Not knowing that my Dao is without words or deeds, one seeks it through words and deeds. Suddenly encountering something strange, they seize it as the Dao, unaware that abandoning the source to seek the stream means never finding the source, or forsaking the root to pursue the branch means never finding the root.\n\nIt is said: In archery, charioteering, lute-playing, or chess, no skill can be mastered in a single breath. Only the Dao, formless and boundless, can be attained in an instant.\n\nIt is said: When two archers meet, skill and clumsiness become apparent. When two chess players meet, victory and defeat become apparent. When two followers of the Dao meet, nothing can be shown. Where nothing can be shown, there is no skill or clumsiness, no victory or defeat.\n\nIt is said: My Dao is like the sea. Toss in a hundred million pieces of gold, and it is not seen. Toss in a hundred million stones, and it is not seen. Toss in a hundred million impurities, and it is not seen. It carries tiny shrimp and small fish, yet also the great *kun* and mighty whale. Gathering all waters, it is not full; dispersing all waters, it is not empty.\n\nIt is said: My Dao is like dwelling in darkness. One in the light cannot see a single thing in the dark, yet one in the dark can see all things in the light.\n\nIt is said: The petty person’s power lies in evil; the noble person’s power lies in good; the sage’s power lies in nothingness. Only in nothingness is the Dao found.\n\nIt is said: My Dao is like a sword. Its edge cuts things and is sharp; grasp its edge, and it wounds.\n\nIt is said: A bamboo basket does not ask the wooden bowl, nor does the bowl answer the basket. A tile does not ask the stone, nor does the stone answer the tile. The Dao is not lost—whether questioning or answering, qi flows back and forth. Where is the Dao?\n\nIt is said: Those who gaze upward at the Dao strain; those who follow the Dao hasten. Both know the affairs of the Dao but not the Dao itself. Thus, the sage does not look to the Dao with regret, nor rely on it for abundance. They do not borrow the Dao from the sage, nor sell it to the foolish.\n\nTwo pillars uphold heaven and earth.\n\nMaster Guan Yin said: Whether a bowl, a basin, a bottle, a pot, a jar, or a vat—all can uphold heaven and earth. Whether cracks on a tortoise shell, stalks of milfoil, broken tiles, or inscribed stones—all can foretell good or ill fortune. Thus, the principles of heaven, earth, and the myriad things are contained within a single thing, and every thing contains them. None borrows from another.\n\nWith my essence, I join their essence; the two essences wrestle, and spirit responds. One female and one male produce eggs; one male and one female produce live young. Form is their essence; principle is their spirit. Love is my essence; observation is my spirit. Love is water; observation is fire. Love clings and observation follows—this is wood. Observation abides and love gathers—this is metal.\n\nFirst, envision the primordial qi within a single thing. Cling to it with love to unite with its form; observe it in darkness to unite with its principle, and the image takes shape. The image of a single movement pervades the great void. From the center, it ascends to become heaven; from the center, it descends to become earth. There is no ascent without descent, no descent without ascent. The ascending is fire; the descending is water. That which wishes to ascend but cannot is wood; that which wishes to descend but cannot is metal.\n\nWood as a thing: drill it to obtain fire; wring it to obtain water. Metal as a thing: strike it to obtain fire; melt it to obtain water. Metal and wood are the intercourse of water and fire. Water is essence and heaven; fire is spirit and earth. Wood is the hun-soul and humanity; metal is the po-soul and things. That which moves without ceasing is time; that which encompasses and abides is direction. Only earth begins and ends it.\n\nThere are those who explain it; there are those who demonstrate it.",

      "translated_text": "It is said: The people of the world cannot be counted by the hundreds of millions. Each person’s dreams differ; each night’s dreams differ. There are heavens and earths, people and things—all formed by thought. They cannot be counted even by the grains of dust. How then can we know that this present heaven and earth are not formed by some thinking being?\n\nIt is said: The heart responds to the jujube; the liver responds to the elm. I communicate with heaven and earth. When yin prevails, I dream of water; when clarity prevails, I dream of fire. Heaven and earth communicate with me. I and heaven and earth seem conjoined, seem separate—each returning to its own purity.\n\nIt is said: Though heaven and earth are vast, they have color, form, number, and direction. Yet I possess that which is neither color nor form, neither number nor direction, yet through which heaven is heaven and earth is earth.\n\nIt is said: Those who die in the womb, those who die in the egg—whether human or thing—though heaven and earth are vast, they do not reckon them. Heaven and earth are but the constructs of my fleeting perception. It is like a hand not touching the blade, a blade not cutting the person.\n\nIt is said: In dreams, in mirrors, in water—heaven and earth exist therein. To rid oneself of the heaven and earth of dreams, one must not sleep. To rid oneself of the heaven and earth of mirrors, one must not look. To rid oneself of the heaven and earth of water, one must not draw from the vessel. Their being or non-being lies here, not there. Thus the sage does not rid himself of heaven and earth but of perception.\n\nIt is said: Heaven is not heaven of itself; there is that which makes it heaven. Earth is not earth of itself; there is that which makes it earth. It is like houses, boats, and carriages—they await people to complete them. They do not complete themselves. Knowing that they depend on something else, knowing that this does not—above, one sees no heaven; below, one sees no earth; within, one sees no self; without, one sees no others.\n\nIt is said: That which has time is qi. That which is not qi has never known day or night. That which has direction is form. That which is not form has never known south or north.\n\nWhat is meant by \"not qi\"? That from which qi arises is like fanning a fan to obtain wind. Before the fanning, there is no wind-qi. Once fanned, it is called qi.\n\nWhat is meant by \"not form\"? That from which form arises is like drilling wood to obtain fire. Before the drilling, there is no fire-form. Once drilled, it is called form.\n\nIt is said: The changes of cold, heat, warmth, and coolness are like tiles and stones. Placed in fire, they become hot; placed in water, they become cold. Breathed upon, they become warm; blown upon, they become cool. It is only because external things come and go, while the tiles and stones themselves neither come nor go. It is like reflections in water—coming and going—while the water itself neither comes nor goes.\n\nIt is said: Shaking a garment in empty space produces wind; exhaling upon an object produces water. Pouring water into water makes sound; striking stone against stone makes light. One who understands this can produce wind, rain, thunder, and lightning. For wind, rain, thunder, and lightning all arise from qi, and qi arises from the mind. It is like inwardly imagining great fire—after a long time, one feels heat. Inwardly imagining great water—after a long time, one feels cold. One who understands this can share in the virtue of heaven and earth.",

      "translated_text": "It is said: The transformations of the five clouds can foretell the year’s abundance or scarcity. The arrival of the eight winds can foretell the moment’s fortune or misfortune. Thus, we know that good and ill omens, blessings and disasters, are but the workings of a single qi.\n\nTranscend self and other, unite with heaven and earth—yet those of limited insight claim them as their own. It is said: Heaven and earth are lodged within. The ten thousand things are lodged within. I am lodged within. The Dao is lodged within. If separated from this lodging, the Dao cannot stand.\n\nThe three ultimates are revered in the sage. Guan Yinzi says: The sage’s governance of the world does not depend on my wisdom or folly. Thus, they honor others’ wisdom as wisdom and acknowledge others’ folly as folly. It does not depend on my right or wrong. Thus, they affirm what is right as right and condemn what is wrong as wrong. Knowing the great unity of past and present, they may prioritize the ancient or the modern. Knowing the great unity of inner and outer, they may prioritize the inner or the outer.\n\nThe things of the world cannot burden them, so they ground themselves in humility. The things of the world cannot be externalized, so they embrace them with emptiness. The things of the world cannot be made difficult, so they act with ease. The things of the world cannot be obstructed, so they adapt with flexibility.\n\nBy this, they harmonize the world at its center and establish rites. By this, they bring harmony to the world and create music. By this, they make the world impartial and manage resources. By this, they encompass the world and defend against insult. By this, they follow the world and establish laws. By this, they observe the world and craft tools.\n\nThe sage does not govern the world by the self but governs the world by the world. The world ascribes merit to the sage, yet the sage attributes merit to the world. Thus, in the governance of Yao, Shun, Yu, and Tang, the world all called it natural.\n\nIt is said: Heaven covers all without exception—giving life and taking it—yet heaven harbors no love or hate. The sun shines on all without exception—illuminating beauty and ugliness—yet the sun makes no distinction of favor or disfavor.\n\nIt is said: The sage’s Dao follows the mandate of heaven; the sage does not claim the Dao as their own. The sage’s virtue aligns with the times; the sage does not claim virtue as their own. The sage’s affairs are for others; the sage does not act for themselves. Thus, the sage does not possess the Dao, does not possess virtue, does not possess affairs.\n\nIt is said: The sage knows the self is no-self, so they unite all with benevolence. They know affairs are no-self, so they weigh them with righteousness. They know the mind is no-self, so they restrain it with propriety. They know knowledge is no-self, so they illuminate it with wisdom. They know words are no-self, so they uphold them with trust.\n\nIt is said: The sage’s Dao may take benevolence as benevolence, or righteousness as benevolence, or propriety or trust as benevolence. Benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trust each encompass the other five. The sage unifies them without fixation, and the world cannot name them.\n\nIt is said: Do not observe the sage by their conduct, for the Dao leaves no traces. Do not observe the sage by their words, for the Dao utters no speech. Do not observe the sage by their abilities, for the Dao does nothing. Do not observe the sage by their appearance, for the Dao has no form.\n\nIt is said: Though conduct may be most lofty, it does not escape high and low. Though words may be most impartial, they do not escape right and wrong. Though abilities may be most divine, they do not escape skill and clumsiness. Though appearance may be most distinct, it does not escape beauty and ugliness. The sage borrows these to reveal themselves to the world. The world, obscured by these, only then perceives the sage.\n\nIt is said: The sage learned from bees to establish ruler and subject, from spiders to weave nets and snares, from rats to institute rites, and from warring ants to deploy troops. The common people learn from the worthy; the worthy learn from the sage; the sage learns from the ten thousand things. Only the sage is one with things, and thus has no self.\n\nIt is said: The sage speaks of the Dao, seeing heaven, earth, and all beings as their Dao.

      "translated_text": "The sage nurtures with green and yellow, shelters as with eggs and wings. They neither cherish the Dao nor discard things, neither honor the noble nor despise the lowly. The worthy call them \"things\"—yet things differ from one another. Day by day they cast some aside, day by day they embrace others. They shorten the long, lengthen the short, straighten the crooked, square the round. This is called \"transforming things.\" Little do they know the sage scorns such杂厕 distinctions, such divisions of rank. This is how they become human—not by making such things their own.\n\nIt is said: Between the sage and the common people, food and drink, clothing, houses, boats and carriages are the same. Wealth and poverty, high and low status are the same. The common people often resemble the sage; the sage often resembles the common people. Those who look up to their loftiness or marvel at their grandeur—is this so? Is this not so?\n\nIt is said: A fish wishing to differ from the school must leap from the water onto the shore, and it dies. A tiger wishing to differ from the pack must leave the mountains for the marketplace, and it is captured. The sage does not differ from the common people—only things cannot confine them.\n\nIt is said: The Dao does nothing. To use the Dao to respond to the world is to treat affairs as the Dao. The Dao has no fixed form. To lodge the Dao in things is to treat things as the Dao. The sage cannot ultimately depart from the Dao to reveal it to others.\n\nIt is said: Like a bell sounding as a bell, like a drum sounding as a drum—such are the sage’s words. Like a cart moving as a cart, like a boat moving as a boat—such are the sage’s actions. None can name them, and so they silence the world’s words. None can know them, and so they seize the world’s wisdom.\n\nIt is said: The centipede eats the snake, the snake eats the frog, the frog eats the centipede—each devours the other. The sage’s words are likewise: they speak of the harm in being, then the harm in non-being, then the harm in neither being nor non-being, then the harm in abandoning neither being nor non-being. Their words move like a saw’s teeth. Only those who truly understand the sage do not cling to a single word.",

      "translated_text": "It is said: Like the dragon, like the flood-dragon; like the snake, like the tortoise; like the fish, like the clam—all these the dragon can become. The flood-dragon, however, is but a flood-dragon; it cannot become a dragon, nor can it become snake, tortoise, fish, or clam. The sage is as the dragon; the worthy, as the flood-dragon.\n\nIt is said: Abiding nowhere in oneself, the forms of things manifest of themselves. In movement, like water; in stillness, like a mirror; in response, like an echo. Vague, as if absent; silent, as if pure. Those who are alike harmonize; those who grasp lose. Never leading others, yet ever following them.\n\nIt is said: Vast and boundless, roaming the Great Beginning—now refining oneself as gold, now as jade; now as dung, now as earth. Now soaring with things, now pursuing them; now mountain-like, now abyss-like. Upright, adaptable, mad, or foolish.\n\nIt is said: One skilled in the qin: with a sorrowful heart, the sound is mournful; with a pensive heart, the sound is lingering; with a resentful heart, the sound is winding; with a yearning heart, the sound is flowing. Yet what produces sorrow, thought, resentment, or longing is neither the hand, nor the bamboo, nor the silk, nor the paulownia. It arises from the heart and accords with the hand; it arises from the hand and accords with the instrument.\n\nThose who possess the Dao do not deviate from the mean.\n\nIt is said: The sage employs speech, action, and thought to align with others; yet in never speaking, never acting, never thinking, lies the difference from others.\n\nIt is said: The clearer the mind of profit and harm, the less harmony among kin. The clearer the mind of worthiness and folly, the less fellowship among friends. The clearer the mind of right and wrong, the less accomplishment in affairs. The clearer the mind of beauty and ugliness, the less accord with things. Thus the sage blends them all.\n\nIt is said: The world’s fools cling blindly; the sage’s foolishness dissolves of itself. Little do they know that the sage is at times foolish, at times wise; at times clumsy, at times skillful.\n\nIt is said: One who takes the worthy as teacher of the sagely becomes a worthy. One who takes the sage as teacher of the sagely becomes a sage. For one who takes the worthy as teacher of the sagely follows traces and forgets the Dao; one who takes the sage as teacher of the sagely turns from traces to unite with the Dao.\n\nIt is said: The worthy strive upward and see not what is below; the multitude strive downward and see not what is above. The sage encompasses both high and low, acting only as is fitting. How can it be said that apart from the worthy and the multitude there exists another kind of sage?\n\nIt is said: In the principles of the world, the male initiates, the female follows; the stallion gallops, the mare pursues; the cock crows, the hen responds. Thus the sage orders words and deeds, while the worthy are constrained by them.\n\nIt is said: The sage’s Dao may transform like a tiger, yet in affairs it moves like a turtle. The Dao may be as fine as a thread, yet in affairs it spreads like a chessboard.\n\nIt is said: What is called the sage’s Dao—how solitary it is! How penetrating! How majestic! How resplendent! Only by being able to pair with all things while no single thing can pair with it does it become the most noble of all things.\n\nIt is said: The clouds’ coiling and unfurling, the birds’ flight and soaring—all occur within the void, thus their transformations are inexhaustible. Such is the sage’s Dao.\n\nThe four symbols—*spirit, essence, soul, and corporeal soul*—\n\nMaster Guan Yin said: Water can be divided or united; essence has no self. Fire depends on oil or fuel; spirit has no self. Thus the ear, though obstructed front and back, can still hear—no self. Wisdom, though lofty, has no self. The singular and odd have no self. Winter’s withering of autumn’s things has no self. Black cannot be altered—no self. Northern longevity has no self. All these are essence.\n\nThe tongue, teeth, and molars form speech—no self. Ritual, though humble, has no self. The dual and even have no self. Summer’s reliance on spring’s things has no self. Red can be altered—no self. Southern heaven has no self. All these are spirit.\n\nWith essence having no self, rice, when its husk is removed, retains its essence. With spirit having no self, ghosts, when they possess things, reveal their spirit.\n\nOne who preserves essence forgets right and wrong, forgets gain and loss. In this, that is not this. One who embraces spirit is at times obscure, at times bright; at times strong, at times weak. In that, this is not this.\n\nIt is said: Essence and spirit are water and fire. The five phases mutually generate and destroy them. Their coming has no beginning; their going, no end. Thus my essence, a single drop, neither perishes nor remains; my spirit, a single flicker, neither arises nor ceases. Only with no self, no other, no beginning, no end does one merge with heaven and earth.\n\nIt is said: Essence is water; corporeal soul is metal. Spirit is fire; soul is wood. Essence governs water; corporeal soul governs metal. Metal generates water, so essence is stored in corporeal soul. Spirit governs fire; soul governs wood. Wood generates fire, so spirit is stored in soul.\n\nWater as a thing can store metal and still it; can nourish wood and flourish it. Thus it separates soul and corporeal soul. Fire as a thing can melt metal and dissolve it; can burn wood and consume it. Thus it obscures soul and corporeal soul.\n\nEssence: in heaven, it is cold; on earth, it is water; in humans, it is essence. Spirit: in heaven, it is heat; on earth, it is fire; in humans, it is spirit. Corporeal soul: in heaven, it is dryness; on earth, it is metal; in humans, it is corporeal soul. Soul: in heaven, it is wind; on earth, it is wood; in humans, it is soul.\n\nOnly by uniting my essence with the essence of heaven, earth, and the myriad things—like myriad waters merging into one—can this be done.

      "translated_text": "Through spirit arises intention; through intention arises the corporeal soul; through the corporeal soul arises essence. The five phases revolve unceasingly, and thus my false heart circulates through the transformations of creation for billions of years without end. Yet kernels sprout into countless trees—though heaven and earth are vast, they cannot sprout a kernel from empty space. Eggs and roosters beget countless birds—though yin and yang are wondrous, they cannot hatch an egg from a roosterless hen.\n\nOnly that which comes from me can all be gathered in a single breath. Then things are transformed into me, and nothing is not me. Of the so-called five phases, who can alter them?\n\nIt is said: The multitude, by using the corporeal soul to grasp the soul, have excess metal and insufficient wood. The multitude, by using the soul to grasp the corporeal soul, have excess wood and insufficient metal. For the corporeal soul stores the soul and accompanies it; the soul wanders and relies on the corporeal soul. By day, the soul lodges in the eyes; by night, the corporeal soul abides in the liver. Lodging in the eyes enables sight; abiding in the liver enables dreams. What is seen is the soul without discrimination; to discriminate and analyze it as heaven and earth is the soul’s habituation. What is dreamed is the corporeal soul without discrimination; to discriminate and analyze it as self and other is the corporeal soul’s habituation.\n\nFire generates earth, thus spirit generates intention. Earth generates metal, thus intention generates the corporeal soul. When spirit moves, it is no longer called spirit but intention. When intention moves, it is no longer called intention but the corporeal soul. Only the sage knows that I am without self and things are without things—all arise from thought and calculation. Therefore, when the myriad things come, I respond to them with nature, not with the heart. Nature is the heart before it sprouts; without heart, there is no intention. Without fire, there is no earth; without intention, there is no corporeal soul. Without earth, there is no metal. If one is absent, all five collapse.\n\nHaving merged heaven, earth, and the myriad things into my soul, I can then merge heaven, earth, and the myriad things into my corporeal soul. All that creation wondrously produces is my soul; all that creation possesses is my corporeal soul. Then there is not a single thing that can enslave me.\n\n*\"Abiding in the liver\" should read \"abiding in the lung.\"*\n\nIt is said: The character for *hun* (魂, soul) is composed of *gui* (鬼, ghost) and *yun* (云, cloud); the character for *po* (魄, corporeal soul) is composed of *gui* (鬼) and *bai* (白, white). This is so in the script. *Gui* is what a person becomes after death; *yun* is wind, and wind is wood; *bai* is qi, and qi is metal. Wind disperses, thus it is light and pure; what is light and pure ascends to heaven. Metal is hard, thus it is heavy and turbid; what is heavy and turbid descends to earth. What is light and pure is the corporeal soul following the soul in ascent; what is heavy and turbid is the soul following the corporeal soul in descent.\n\nSome ascend through benevolence to become assistants to Jupiter. Some ascend through righteousness to become assistants to Venus. Some ascend through propriety to become assistants to Mars. Some ascend through wisdom to become assistants to Mercury. Some ascend through trustworthiness to become assistants to Saturn.\n\nSome sink through lack of benevolence, and wood destroys them. Some sink through lack of righteousness, and metal destroys them. Some sink through lack of propriety, and fire destroys them. Some sink through lack of wisdom, and water destroys them. Some sink through lack of trustworthiness, and earth destroys them. When soul and corporeal soul are evenly divided, they remain in the human realm.\n\nThe soul’s ascent brings nobility; the corporeal soul’s descent brings baseness. A numinous soul brings worthiness; a vicious corporeal soul brings foolishness. A light soul brings clarity; a heavy corporeal soul brings obscurity.

      "translated_text": "All things are aligned through the Five Phases. Yet the number five is uneven and inconsistent—hence the boundless multiplicity of the myriad beings filling heaven and earth, never ceasing. The Five Affairs correspond to the Five Phases, and the Five Phases give rise to the Five Creatures—how can one exhaust their enumeration? It is like divining with a tortoise shell or counting with milfoil stalks: when utmost sincerity is present, the Five Phases respond. If sincerity is lacking, even with divination and counting, not one will answer.\n\nThe sage borrows external things to traverse the world, and the Five Phases cannot but respond. It is said: The Five possess souls. The soul is consciousness. The eye is essence. Color is spirit. What sees is the soul. The ears, eyes, mouth, nose, and heart—all that pertains to this life—love is essence, the root of that life’s father. Observation is spirit, the root of that life’s mother. Though love and observation differ, both arise from the same consciousness. The root of that life lies in that which gives life: the first is the father, whence one receives qi—qi is water. The second is the mother, whence one receives blood—blood is fire. With father and mother, that life is born.\n\nYet love without consciousness is like interlocking chains, and observation without consciousness is like a lamp’s illumination. If my consciousness does not stir, how can my life exist? It is said: Like a drumstick striking a drum—the drum’s form is my possession, the drum’s sound is my perception. The stick has departed, yet the lingering resonance remains, though in the end, nothing endures. The drum’s form is like my essence, the drum’s sound like my spirit. The lingering resonance is like the soul and corporeal soul. Knowing that they fleetingly come and go, how can the qi of the Five Phases belong to me?\n\nIt is said: The fruit’s kernel must await the presence of water, fire, and earth—only then can generation continue without end. If these three are incomplete, as in great drought, great flood, or barren clod, none suffice to generate beings. Essence (water), spirit (fire), and intent (earth)—these three do not originally interact. Only when humans unite them through the root can activity arise within. It is like a shaman who perceives manifold events within utter emptiness.\n\nIt is said: The soul is wood. Wood’s roots lie in winter’s water, and it blossoms in summer’s fire. Thus, the human soul is stored in night’s essence and appears in day’s spirit. When united with essence, what is seen is uniquely mine—for essence has never belonged to another. When united with spirit, what is seen is shared by all—for spirit has never belonged to me.\n\nIt is said: Know that this body is like a body in a dream, appearing as emotion dictates—then you may soar with spirit as your self and wander the Great Purity. Know that this thing is like a thing in a dream, appearing as emotion dictates—then you may condense essence into form and traverse the eight wilds. This Dao enables one to perceive spirit and essence and attain long life, or to forget spirit and essence and transcend life.\n\nInhale qi to nourish essence, as metal generates water. Inhale wind to nourish spirit, as wood generates fire. Thus, one borrows the external to extend spirit and essence. Rinse with water to nourish essence, so that essence never exhausts. Rub with fire to nourish spirit, so that spirit never exhausts. Thus, one borrows the internal to extend spirit and essence.\n\nAs for those who forget spirit and essence to transcend life, I have already spoken of this. It is said: One diligent in propriety does not let spirit scatter—thus can gather spirit. One diligent in wisdom does not let essence stray—thus can preserve essence. Benevolence is yang and luminous—thus can lighten the soul. Righteousness is yin and obscure—thus can govern the corporeal soul.\n\nIt is said: The dung beetle rolls its pellet, and through concentrated thought, a wriggling white grub comes to dwell within.

      "translated_text": "It is said: A cook stews a crab, leaving one leg upon the table. The crab is already stewed, yet the discarded leg still twitches. This is life and death—nothing more than the gathering and scattering of a single qi. Neither born nor dead, yet people arbitrarily impose the notions of life and death.\n\nIt is said: There are those who die standing, those who die sitting, those who die lying down, those who die of illness, and those who die from medicine. All deaths are equal, without distinction of rank. But the one who understands the Dao does not see life, and thus does not see death.\n\nIt is said: Those who weary of life and death or seek to transcend life and death are all afflicted by the same great delusion. It is like a phantom—if it harbors weariness of life and death or the desire to transcend them, it is called a demon, not the Dao.\n\nIt is said: Those who calculate life and death say either that death leaves something behind, or that death leaves nothing behind, or that death leaves both something and nothing, or that death leaves neither something nor nothing. Some say one should rejoice, some say one should fear, some say one should accept, some say one should transcend. The more their perceptions shift, the more their minds race without cease. They do not realize that my life and death are like a horse’s hand or a cow’s wing—originally non-existent, and yet not even the absence exists. It is like water and fire: though one may violate water and fire, they cannot be burned or drowned.\n\nThe five mirrors are the mind.\nMaster Guan Yin said: The mind obscured by fortune and misfortune is seized by numinous ghosts. The mind obscured by desire for men and women is seized by lustful ghosts. The mind obscured by hidden sorrow is seized by sinking ghosts. The mind obscured by dissipation is seized by mad ghosts. The mind obscured by oaths and curses is seized by strange ghosts. The mind obscured by medicines and elixirs is seized by material ghosts. Such ghosts may take yin as their body, or darkness as their body, or wind as their body, or qi as their body, or clay figurines as their body, or painted images as their body, or old beasts as their body, or broken vessels as their body. Their essence meets with your essence, and when the two essences clash, spirit responds. Those seized by ghosts may interpret omens, or strange events, or auspicious signs. Such people grow arrogant, claiming not that ghosts dwell within them, but that the Dao dwells within them. Over time, they may die by wood, or by metal, or by rope, or by well.\n\nOnly the sage can be spirit-like without being ensnared by spirits, command the myriad things while grasping their mechanism. They can gather them, scatter them, or master them. Daily, they respond to the ten thousand things, yet their mind remains still.\n\nIt is said: Without a unified mind, the five senses race in all directions—the mind cannot be unified. Without an empty mind, the five phases are all present—the mind cannot be empty. Without a still mind, the ten thousand transformations shift imperceptibly—the mind cannot be still. If you force unity, duality arises. If you force emptiness, fullness fills it. If you force stillness, movement stirs it. Only the sage can gather the ten thousand existences into a single breath, so that not one thing can enslave their clarity. They can scatter a single breath into the ten thousand existences, so that not one thing can interrupt their cloud-like actions.\n\nIt is said: A fire of a thousand years can suddenly be extinguished; a consciousness of a thousand years can suddenly be dispelled.\n\nIt is said: The floating is the boat, but what makes it float is the water, not the boat. The moving is the cart, but what makes it move is the ox, not the cart. The thinking is the mind, but what makes it think is intention, not the mind. Not knowing why it is so, yet it is so. Only by not knowing why it is so can its coming have no source, its going no place. Its coming has no source, its going no place—thus it can unite with the original source of heaven and earth, neither ancient nor modern.\n\nIt is said: Know that the mind is without thing, and you will know that things are without thing. Know that things are without thing, and you will know that the Dao is without thing. Know that the Dao is without thing, and thus you will neither follow extraordinary conduct nor marvel at subtle words.\n\nIt is said: When things and self interact, the mind arises. When two pieces of wood rub, fire arises. You cannot say it is in me, nor in the other; you cannot say it is not in me, nor not in the other. To cling to distinctions of self and other is foolishness.\n\nIt is said: Do not rely on what you call benefit and harm, right and wrong. Are what you call benefit and harm, right and wrong truly benefit and harm, right and wrong? The sage does not even recognize or know—how much less can you?",

      "translated_text": "It is said: The dreams of the night may last longer than the night itself. When the mind arises in Qi, all it sees is the state of Qi. Then, traveling to Song, to Chu, to Jin, to Liang—what the mind holds differs each time, for the mind has no fixed direction.\n\nIt is said: The master archer learns from the bow, not from Yi. The master boatman learns from the boat, not from [the legendary sailor]. The master of the mind learns from the mind, not from the sages.\n\nIt is said: Right and wrong, beauty and ugliness, success and failure, fullness and emptiness—these are set in motion by the Maker of Things. All arise from clinging to private perceptions. Thus, even when you dismiss them as nothing, they remain. Even when you dismiss them as neither existent nor non-existent, they remain. Whether you call them obscure or undifferentiated, they remain. It is like revisiting a place you once traveled: the memory is vivid. This cannot be forgotten, cannot be dismissed. The one who skillfully dissolves perception transforms perception into wisdom. Do you understand this teaching of transforming perception into wisdom?\n\nIt is said: Thoughts are like imagining ghosts—when the mind trembles at the thought of thieves, fear arises, and this is perception. It is like mistaking millet for sorghum, or jade for stone. Floating and formless, it has no fixed abode. As when seeing a strange thing, one conceives a strange thought, and from that thought arises strange perception. This thought, this perception—its root is not in me. It is like today: today alone exists. As for tomorrow, thoughts and perceptions are yet unpredictable. When tomorrow comes, the swirling thoughts and perceptions all arise from existence.\n\nIt is said: Like the rhinoceros gazing at the moon, the moon’s form appears in its horn—this is solely due to perception. Only then does the moon’s form exist, yet the true moon was never in the horn. The myriad things of heaven and earth within the breast are likewise. One who understands this teaching sees nothing outside as objects, nothing inside as emotions.\n\nIt is said: Things arise from earth and ultimately return to earth. Affairs arise from intention and ultimately return to intention. Know that it is intention alone that suddenly affirms, suddenly denies, suddenly deems good, suddenly deems bad. Intention changes, but the mind does not change. Intention is aware, but the mind is not aware. Only my single mind exists—then intention is but dust passing to and fro, and affairs are but fleeting apparitions. My mind holds what is eternally constant.\n\nIt is said: Emotions arise from the mind, and the mind arises from nature. Emotions are waves, the mind is the current, and nature is the water. What comes to assail me is like a spark from striking stone. If nature receives it, then the mind does not arise, and things float lightly away.\n\nIt is said: Of worthiness and foolishness, truth and falsity, some perceive them, some do not. Though there may be worthiness and foolishness, though there may be truth and falsity, what we call worthiness and foolishness, truth and falsity—these are tied to my perception. Knowing that all are formed by perception, even what is true is treated as false.\n\nIt is said: When the mind responds to things, it does not give rise to the mind but to emotions. When things interact with the mind, they do not give rise to things but to perception. Things are not even real—how much less perception? Perception is not even real—how much less emotions? Yet deluded people, in the midst of utter nothingness, cling to it as something. In the midst of constant change, they cling to it as constant. Grasping one emotion, they accumulate ten thousand emotions. Grasping ten thousand emotions, they accumulate ten thousand things. Things come endlessly, but my mind has its limits. Thus, my good mind is controlled by emotions, and my fundamental emotions are controlled by things. They can be made to depart, they can be made to arrive, yet their coming and going was never in my power. Creation enslaves them without cease. Little do they know that though heaven and earth are vast, they can enslave the formed but cannot enslave the formless. Though yin and yang are subtle, they can enslave the qi-endowed but cannot enslave the qi-less. Where the mind goes, qi follows. Where qi goes, form responds. It is like the great void transforming into the myriad things within a single bowl, yet that bowl is not called the great void. My single mind can transform into qi, can transform into form, yet my mind is without qi, without form. Know that my single mind is without qi, without form, and then heaven and earth, yin and yang cannot enslave it.\n\nIt is said: When a person in ordinary times suddenly sees an extraordinary thing, it is because essence has congealed to make it so. When a person in illness suddenly sees an extraordinary thing, it is because the mind has some deficiency to make it so. If you know that my mind can manifest existence from nothingness, then you know that my mind can manifest nothingness from existence. But if you do not believe it, it will naturally not be numinous. Some say: When perception is already obscured, who can avoid believing it? I reply: Like the snake-catcher who does not fear snakes, though he dreams of snakes, he does not feel dread.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said: The Dao has no ghosts or spirits, it comes and goes alone.\n\nIt is said: My thoughts and concerns change daily—something makes them do so, and it is not I. It is fate. If you know it is only fate, then outwardly you see no self, inwardly you see no mind.\n\nIt is said: Like two eyes that can see the myriad things of heaven and earth, if they briefly turn their light away, they see nothing for a time.\n\nIt is said: The eye that gazes at carvings becomes more injured the sharper it is. The ear that hears intricate sounds becomes more injured the keener it is. The mind that ponders the profound becomes more injured the deeper it goes.\n\nIt is said: Do not measure others with your own mind; rather, measure others with their own minds. One who understands this teaching can manage affairs, cultivate virtue, penetrate the Dao, interact with others, and forget the self.\n\nIt is said: The principles of the world begin with small things that are not controlled, leading to great things, and great things that are not controlled, leading to the uncontrollable. Thus, one who can control a single emotion can perfect virtue. One who can forget a single emotion can align with the Dao.\n\nSix *bi* spoons are for eating, and eating is for the body.\n\nMaster Guan Yin said: People of the world distinguish between \"my thoughts\" and \"their thoughts,\" \"their thoughts\" and \"my thoughts,\" dividing self and other. Little do they know that in dreams, \"my thoughts\" also differ from \"their thoughts,\" and \"their thoughts\" differ from \"my thoughts.\" Who then is self, and who is other? People of the world distinguish between \"my pain\" and \"their pain,\" \"their pain\" and \"my pain,\" dividing self and other.",
      "overlap_context": "rds.\n\nIt is said: When things and self interact, the mind arises. When two pieces of wood rub, fire arises. You cannot say it is in me, nor in the other; you cannot say it is not in me, nor not in the other. To cling to distinctions of self and other is foolishness.\n\nIt is said: Do not rely on what you call benefit and harm, right and wrong. Are what you call benefit and harm, right and wrong truly benefit and harm, right and wrong? The sage does not even recognize or know—how much less can you?",

How can one distinguish self and other by thoughts and pains?\n\nPeople of the world regard solitary visions as dreams and shared visions as wakefulness.

Those who favor righteousness often dream of weapons, blades, gold, and iron. Those who favor propriety often dream of ritual vessels. Those who favor wisdom often dream of rivers, lakes, streams, and marshes. Those who favor trustworthiness often dream of mountains, peaks, plains, and fields.

The Five Phases cannot be rigidly confined.\n\nThe sage governs things with the heart and restrains the heart with nature. Then the heart aligns with the transformations of creation, and the Five Phases cannot be rigidly confined.\n\nIt is said: If you see one with the head of a serpent and the body of a man, or the arms of an ox and the scales of a fish, or the form of a ghost and the wings of a bird, do not be startled.

      "translated_text": "The body becomes profound—one may ride upon dragons and whales. Being is nonbeing; nonbeing is being. Those who know this Dao may command ghosts and spirits. Substance is emptiness; emptiness is substance. Those who know this Dao may enter metal and stone. Above is below; below is above. Those who know this Dao may attend the stars. Past is present; present is past. Those who know this Dao may divine with tortoise and milfoil. Others are myself; myself is others. Those who know this Dao may peer into the lungs and liver of others. Things are myself; myself is things. Those who know this Dao may cultivate dragons and tigers within the belly.\n\nKnowing that images arise from the heart’s transformation, by observing the heart one may become a female infant. Knowing that qi arises from the heart’s generation, by absorbing spirit one may become a furnace. By this, one may overcome things—tigers and leopards may be tamed. By this, one may unite with things—water and fire may be entered. Only those who possess the Dao can do these things, yet they may also be capable of them without acting.\n\nIt is said: Human power can seize the transformations of Heaven and Earth. In winter, thunder may arise; in summer, frost may form. A corpse may walk; a withered tree may bloom. Ghosts may be summoned within beans; fish may be hooked in a cup. A painted door may open; a clay ghost may speak. All these are the work of pure qi. Thus, one may transform the myriad things.\n\nNow, the ceaseless flux of human emotions is also the work of qi. Yet qi as a thing has convergence and dispersion. That by which I move qi has never converged, nor has it ever dispersed. Convergence gives rise to life; dispersion brings death. That which has never converged nor dispersed is without life or death. Guests come and go, yet the inn remains unchanged.\n\nIt is said: There are those who recite incantations, those who serve spirits, those who use written talismans, and those who transform with finger gestures—all may employ spirits and command qi to transform the myriad things. Yet those lacking sincerity find it difficult to trust themselves and easy to trust external things, so they rely on these methods. If one knows only sincerity, there is no need to wait for such means to achieve the same.\n\nIt is said: With each breath, a person traverses four hundred thousand li—transformation may indeed be swift. Only the sage remains unmoved and unchanged.\n\nIt is said: The Azure Simurgh lives a thousand years, and after a thousand years, it transforms. The peach tree serves five lords, and its heart transforms five times. The sage dismisses affairs and departs from things—how could they not wish to establish themselves in the world? Those bound by form and number fear the unknowable nature of transformation.\n\nIt is said: Though the myriad things shift and change, appearing and disappearing, their qi is one and the same. Only the sage knows the One and does not transform.\n\nIt is said: The growth of nails, the lengthening of hair, the circulation of nourishing and defending qi—none ceases for even a moment. The common see these changes in the manifest but cannot perceive them in the subtle. The worthy perceive them in the subtle but cannot yield to transformation. The sage yields to transformation, and thus remains without transformation.\n\nIt is said: Within a chamber, one’s perceptions are constant. Yet stepping through the gate, to the neighbor, the village, the district, then to the outskirts, the mountains, the rivers—perceptions differ, likes and dislikes follow, harmony and contention arise, gain and loss take shape. Thus, the sage moves and rests with caution.\n\nIt is said: Like the great sea, which transforms countless dragons and fish, its water remains one. I and the myriad things flourish abundantly within the great transformation—our nature is one and the same. Those who know this unity of nature transcend self and other, life and death.\n\nIt is said: In the world, right may transform into wrong, wrong into right; kindness into enmity, enmity into kindness. Thus, the sage dwells in constancy yet contemplates change.\n\nIt is said: In youth, one should heed the teachings of parents and elders. In maturity, one should grasp the admonitions of friends. In old age, one should be warned by the words of the young and strong. Though the myriad transformations shift, they cannot constrain me.\n\nIt is said: In the world, the light is easily transformed, the heavy is difficult to change. Like wind and clouds, which vanish in an instant, the nature of gold and jade endures unchanged for ages. Those who are light and bright may transform with creation without lingering—yet something untransformed remains within.\n\nIt is said: Two children may be close, yet in maturity, they meet as strangers. Two adults may be close, yet in old age, they meet as strangers. Like the transformations of sparrows, pigeons, hawks, and turtledoves, there is no past, no present.",

      "translated_text": "The Eight Strategies are things of the world.\n\nMaster Guan Yin said: Those of old skilled in divining with milfoil and scorching tortoise shells could reveal the ancient within the present, the present within the ancient; the high within the low, the low within the high; the small within the great, the great within the small; the one within the many, the many within the one; the human within things, things within the human; the self within the other, the other within the self. This is the Dao.\n\nIts coming has no present, its going has no past. Its height has no canopy, its depth has no foundation. Its greatness has no exterior, its smallness has no interior. Beyond it, no things exist; within it, no person resides. Its nearness has no self, its distance has no other. It cannot be divided, cannot be united, cannot be described, cannot be pondered. Only in its undifferentiated wholeness does it become the Dao.\n\nIt is said: Water sinks, thus congealing into the five essences. Fire soars, thus dispersing into the five odors. Wood flourishes, thus blooming into the five colors. Metal hardens, thus solidifying into the five sounds. Earth harmonizes, thus nurturing into the five flavors. Though constant in five, their transformations are beyond reckoning. Though things are five, their combinations are beyond reckoning.\n\nThus, the myriad things between heaven and earth cannot be rigidly called ten thousand, nor rigidly called five, nor rigidly called one; nor can they be rigidly called not ten thousand, not five, not one. Some unite, some separate—through this, form is necessarily determined; through this, number is necessarily fixed; through this, qi is necessarily manifest. Yet all is but vain labor. Things do not know me, and I do not know things.\n\nIt is said: Within my heart, the myriad things may arise. For where the heart directs, love follows; where love follows, essence follows. Where the heart knots, it first congeals into water. The heart’s longing produces the drool of things; the heart’s sorrow produces the tears of things; the heart’s shame produces the sweat of things. There is no moment that does not endure, no endurance that does not change.\n\nWater generates wood, wood generates fire, fire generates earth, earth generates metal, metal generates water.

      "translated_text": "The Infant and the Maiden, the Golden Tower and the Crimson Palace, the Azure Dragon and the White Tiger, the Jeweled Tripod and the Scarlet Furnace—all are this thing. Yet there is that which exists beyond this thing.\n\nIt is said: Beasts may suddenly cry *yōu-yōu*, then *xún-xún*, then flee in terror. Plants may suddenly sprout *zhuó-zhuó*, then stand *tíng-tíng*, then wither *xiāo-xiāo*. Heaven and earth cannot retain them; the sage cannot bind them. Only that which moves endures.\n\nThere is existence in that; there is nonexistence in this. A drum does not sound without a drumstick. Evenness lies in that; oddness lies in this. A drumstick does not strike without a hand.\n\nIt is said: All is one thing. The multitude are deluded by names—they see things but not the Dao. The worthy analyze principles—they see the Dao but not things. The sage unites with heaven—they see neither Dao nor things. The Dao is wholly Dao. Not grasping it is the Dao; grasping it is a thing.\n\nIt is said: One who knows the falsity of things need not reject them. For example, seeing an earthen ox or a wooden horse, though the name of ox or horse lingers in the mind, the reality of ox or horse is forgotten.\n\nThe Nine Medicines are a compound remedy.\n\nMaster Guan Yin said: Do not slight small matters—a tiny crack sinks a boat. Do not slight small things—a tiny insect poisons the body. Do not slight small men—a petty man betrays the state. Only by attending to small matters can one accomplish great ones. Only by accumulating small things can one achieve great ones. Only by befriending small men can one unite with great ones.\n\nHeaven cannot be certain of man; man cannot be certain of affairs. Only by distancing oneself from affairs and separating from others does the self remain in the self. Only what is fitting is fitting—there is no fixed rule for simplicity or complexity, for restraint or patience, for diligence or indolence.\n\nIt is said: The height of wisdom is knowing that wisdom is insufficient to encompass all things—thus, one becomes foolish. The height of eloquence is knowing that eloquence is insufficient to express all things—thus, one becomes speechless. The height of courage is knowing that courage is insufficient to overcome all things—thus, one becomes timid.\n\nIt is said: Among heaven and earth’s myriad things, not one is mine. Things are not me—they cannot but respond. I am not me—I cannot but nurture myself. Though responding to things, there are no things. Though nurturing myself, there is no self. Do not say “external things” and thereby externalize the self. Do not say “external form” and thereby externalize the heart. The Dao is one and alone—it cannot be ordered in progression.\n\nIt is said: One who scrutinizes the tip of a hair does not see the vastness of heaven and earth. One who listens closely to faint sounds does not hear the crash of thunder. Seeing the great, one does not see the small. Seeing the near, one does not see the far. Hearing the great, one does not hear the small. Hearing the near, one does not hear the far. The sage sees nothing—thus, nothing is unseen. Hears nothing—thus, nothing is unheard.\n\nIt is said: The eye sees countless things—some love gold, some love jade. This is grasping one color for the eye. The ear hears countless things—some love bells, some love drums. This is grasping one sound for the ear. Only the sage neither craves nor rejects, neither dwells nor departs.\n\nIt is said: One who excels in the present can practice the ancient. One who excels in the branch can establish the root.\n\nIt is said: The cunning outwit thieves—thus, they can capture thieves. The brave overpower tigers—thus, they can capture tigers. Only by overcoming the self can one perfect the self. Only by overcoming things can one benefit things. Only by forgetting the Dao can one possess the Dao.\n\nIt is said: If rigid, things will surely break it—hardness invites fracture. If sharp, things will surely shatter it—keenness invites blunting. The sacred phoenix is revered for its rarity—thus, the sage takes depth as the root. The fleeing musk deer leaves its fragrance uncaught—thus, the sage takes restraint as the principle.\n\nIt is said: A jar has two holes. Fill it with water and invert it—if one hole is blocked, the water does not flow out. For it does not rise if it does not descend. Though a well be a thousand fathoms deep, drawing water brings it up. For it does not descend if it does not rise. Thus, the sage does not precede things.\n\nIt is said: When a man errs, though he suffers harm after the mistake, in time, he secretly criticizes himself before the error. Only by not relying on one’s own wisdom but embracing others’ wisdom, only by having no self but embracing the world’s selves, can one walk through life without fault.\n\nIt is said: The customs of past and present differ; the customs of east, west, south, and north differ further. Even the virtues of a single family or person differ. How could I cling to one pattern to constrain later ages? Only by following the times and conforming to customs, acting before the moment and after the event, relinquishing anger and restraining desire, simplifying things and forgiving others, weighing their importance and acting naturally—thus, one merges with the unfathomable and unites with the Dao without fixed method.\n\nIt is said: There are those who unite through the Dao, through virtue, or through affairs. Those who unite through the Dao are like father and son—they stand beyond right and wrong, worthy and unworthy, and thus endure. Those who unite through virtue enter into right and wrong, worthy and unworthy—thus, they may unite or part. Those who unite through affairs part when they unite.\n\nIt is said: Do not dismiss clumsiness—Dao’s essence delights in agility. Do not dismiss ignorance—Dao’s obscurity delights in clarity. Do not dismiss arrogance—Dao’s loftiness delights in harmony. Do not dismiss dissipation—Dao’s vastness delights in focus. Do not dismiss melancholy—Dao’s stillness delights in joy.\n\nThe ancients’ words, when studied excessively, breed many faults—one must remedy them.\n\nIt is said: Do not condemn the world and praise oneself. Do not belittle others and exalt oneself. Do not take the Dao lightly and neglect oneself. Do not slander virtue and disparage oneself. Do not despise talent and debase oneself.\n\nIt is said: To confound the world’s wise, it is not in wisdom but in foolishness. To exhaust the world’s eloquent, it is not in eloquence but in speechlessness. To subdue the world’s brave, it is not in courage but in timidity.\n\nIt is said: Heaven cannot make winter lotuses or spring chrysanthemums—thus, the sage does not defy the seasons. Earth cannot make oranges from Lu grow in Wen or raccoon dogs from Wen grow in Lu.",
