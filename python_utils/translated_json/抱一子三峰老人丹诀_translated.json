  "full_translation": "**The Alchemical Secrets of Master Baoyi of Sanfeng: A Daoist Manual**\n\n*Title:* *The Alchemical Secrets of Master Baoyi of Sanfeng*\nCompiled by Yuan Jin Yueyan, transmitted by Huang Gongwang. One scroll.\n*Source:* *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongzhen* section, *Zhongshu* category.\n\n**The Alchemical Secrets of Master Baoyi of Sanfeng**\nIncludes *Oral Instructions on the Golden Cicada Shedding Its Shell and Ascending as a Heavenly Immortal* by Master Liu, *Oral Instructions on the True and False Nature of Life*, sixteen heptasyllabic quatrains on the *Weilü* point—matching the weight of heaven and earth in a single catty—and a preface by the author.\n\nSince Pangu divided heaven and earth, to this very day, the cycle of human rebirth has known no end. Alas! The human body is hard to obtain, yet time flashes by like lightning. In youth, one refuses to awaken; in old age, one resigns to awaiting death. If at the final moment a single thought strays, one is cast into the six paths of rebirth. The true nature enters another shell, and though one may pass through ten thousand kalpas, escape remains impossible. At such a time, what use is regret?\n\nYet most who aspire to the Dao through the ages fail to meet a true master and receive oral transmission. Instead, they cling to misguided notions and fall into delusion. Some eat pine needles and cypress leaves; some drink water and swallow talismans; some swallow saliva and spit; some exhale the old and inhale the new; some absorb the essence of the sun and moon; some practice massage and daoyin; some observe fasts and abstain from grain; some blindly cultivate and recklessly refine; some press the tongue to the palate and still the heart. All these methods are but side doors and minor arts, unrelated to the cultivation of true nature and life.\n\nLittle do they know that the term \"nature and life\" itself has true and false forms. The true nature and life give rise to the yang spirit. The yang spirit is the method of attaining the great perfection of a heavenly immortal. The false nature and life give rise to the yin spirit. The yin spirit is the minor attainment of a ghostly immortal. How laughable are those who cultivate the yin spirit! Ignorant and unlearned, they fail to grasp the techniques of withdrawing lead and adding mercury, or the art of refining the great elixir of golden cinnabar. How could they know the methods of subduing the dragon and taming the tiger?\n\nInstead, they foolishly engage in internal visualization, focusing on the lower dantian, calming the mind and stabilizing intention, nurturing spirit and qi, claiming success in their endeavors, imagining the formation of the golden elixir within, and seeking the great medicine through mere thought. Such practices are no different from child’s play. Unaware of true lead and true mercury, they mistake spirit and qi for nature and life—like claiming another’s wealth as their own or calling a child of another surname their own kin.\n\nAs the saying goes: \"Wealth gained in a dream cannot sustain one; a cake drawn on the ground cannot fill the stomach.\" All is emptiness within emptiness, like flowers in a mirror or the moon in water—ultimately, nothing is achieved. Those who, ignorant of the method of the golden elixir and great medicine, cling to internal visualization and contemplation are dismissed by the wise and extraordinary.\n\nThe Immortal of Longevity once wrote:\n*\"If the embryonic immortal could be formed through mere thought,\nThen even a maiden without a husband could conceive.\"*\n\nZhang Ping Shu said:\n*\"No matter how much you practice breath control and visualization,\nIt is entirely different from the work of the golden elixir.\"*\n\nAnd the True Man Zhongli Quan declared:\n*\"Without true lead and mercury, the elixir of return cannot be attained,\nAnd one will sink for ten thousand kalpas into the realm of death.\"*\n\nThis is the truth.\n\nFor beginners on the Daoist path, the mind is like a restless monkey and the intention like a galloping horse, racing without pause. Fearful of losing their resolve amidst external distractions, they close their ears to sound, avert their eyes from sights, calm their minds, and steady their intentions. They practice internal visualization, focusing on the lower dantian, calming the mind and stabilizing intention, nurturing spirit and qi. This practice must not be neglected, nor should one become attached to it, nor should it be lightly employed for minor purposes.\n\nThe terms \"lead\" and \"mercury\" do not refer to spirit and qi. Lead and mercury have weight; how can spirit and qi be weighed? Lead and mercury can be withdrawn and added; how can spirit and qi be spoken of in such terms?\n\nThere are also those who, in their cultivation, fail to properly nurture spirit and qi, ignorant even of minor methods, yet stubbornly cling to vast, empty notions. They claim to do nothing, asserting that the great Dao is formless and imageless, originally without lack or excess—so what is there to cultivate? When hungry, they eat; when full, they sleep. Such cultivators, in the end, are like withered trees sprouting mad blossoms—no different from a lost traveler wandering in the night. How pitiful!\n\nYet if the great Dao is truly without words or form, what manner of cultivation did Ancestor Wang encounter when he met the True Man Lü at Ganhe Town? When a cultivator completes the great medicine of the golden elixir, its light illuminates the ten directions, its brilliance pervades the four seas. When gathered, it takes form; when scattered, it is boundless—capable of a thousand transformations and ten thousand changes. This is the great Dao.\n\nMen possess internal kidneys, which lie opposite the navel, adhering to the spine—these are the two kidneys. The primordial yang and golden essence of man arise from the internal kidneys. The internal kidneys are also called the *Reclining Moon Furnace* or *Jade Furnace*. The heart is the golden tripod. The internal and external kidneys together form the *Kan* trigram. One must never purify the body by removing the external kidneys, for this would damage one’s natural endowment and make attaining the Dao impossible.\n\nThe kidneys are the master of the five viscera. Man has three palaces and three fields: the crown of the head is the *Mud Pill*, called the upper dantian; the heart is the *Crimson Palace*, called the middle dantian; one *cun* and three *fen* below the navel is the *Yellow Court Palace*, called the lower dantian. This is the chamber for nurturing the sacred embryo and the furnace for refining the great medicine of the golden elixir.\n\nMan has five viscera, each containing an essence, and all five essences gather in the lower dantian. The lower dantian is green on the left, white on the right, red above, black below, and yellow at the center. The lower dantian is also called the *Palace of Five Lights*, the *Precious Vase Palace*, the *Palace of Water Essence*, the *Furnace of the Five Phases*, the *Dragon Pool*, the *Phoenix Pool*, the *Jade Pool*, the *Elixir Pool*, the *Flower Pool*, the *Pool of Seven Treasures*, the *Anavatapta Pool*, the *Land of Golden Profit*, and the *Sea of Qi*.\n\nThe human heart corresponds to the southern *bing-ding* fire, while the kidneys correspond to the northern *ren-gui* water—these are but provisional water and fire. The lead and mercury within the heart and kidneys are the true *Kan* (☵) and *Li* (☲). For those who cultivate immortality and study the Dao, the first task is to recognize the guest and host of *xing* (nature) and *ming* (life).\n\nIn the household of *xing*, when the mind-monkey is let loose and lost abroad, it serves as the guest; when awakened and returned home, neither dull nor deluded, neither swaying nor moving, it becomes the host—this is the guest and host of *xing*. In the household of *ming*, mercury, symbolizing wood and fire, the dragon, floats in *Li* as the guest; lead, symbolizing metal and water, the tiger, sinks in *Kan* as the host. As Zhang Pingshu said: *\"Who knows the inversion of Kan and Li, or discerns the floating and sinking to determine guest and host?\"* The Supreme Lord said: *\"Take lead as the sovereign, mercury as the minister; if lead is not true, mercury cannot be stabilized.\"* Lead is the master of transformation—this is the guest and host of *ming*.\n\nMoreover, lead and mercury may be true or false, existing within the wondrous subtleties of the human body’s refinement of the great medicine of the golden elixir. True lead and mercury were born before heaven and earth; false lead and mercury arose after them. True lead and mercury are formless transformation; false lead and mercury are formed transformation.\n\nTrue lead and mercury existed before the void of heaven and earth—these are the formless *geng-xin* true metal of the West. Metal is lead, and lead gives birth to mercury. Lead and mercury are the formless *ren-gui* true water of the North. When lead obtains mercury, it takes form, gradually giving rise to heaven and earth, the sun and moon, mountains and seas, human relationships, and all the myriad things. Metal is the mother of water, the mother concealed within the child’s womb; water is the child of metal, the child hidden within the mother’s belly. Metal’s body is hard and unyielding, impervious to decay—it is the root of metal, the foundation of the great elixir’s firmness. True metal is the mother of all things. As the *Daodejing* says: *\"Nameless, it is the beginning of heaven and earth; named, it is the mother of the myriad things.\"*\n\nTian Zhenhuangren’s commentary on the *Yinfu Jing* states: *\"The One is the root of heaven and earth, the mother of yin and yang. All things take it as their model for generation, and the thousand spirits respond to it with joy or sorrow. It is born in the high heavens and the deep earth, in grotto heavens and immortal mountains, in the numinous palaces of the mysterious realm. None among the divine immortals and sages lack something generated by the qi of lead.\"* If one can refine lead into *qi*, then the myriad spirits arise of themselves—hence, one does not die.\n\nAs for the forging of lead and mercury, these are black tin and quicksilver. Black tin is lead, and quicksilver is mercury; black tin is the mother of the five metals, while quicksilver is the thief of the five metals. Black lead transforms into yellow cinnabar—this is yin returning to yang. Yellow cinnabar reverts to black tin—this is yang returning to yin. Quicksilver transforms into vermilion—this is yin returning to yang. Vermilion reverts to quicksilver—this is yang returning to yin. Black tin transforms into refined powder, and quicksilver into light powder. These two substances, quicksilver and black tin, each contain the Five Phases of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth, giving rise to the five colors: green, red, yellow, white, and black. Though black tin and quicksilver are false lead and mercury, they resemble the transformations of heaven, earth, and humanity.\n\nHeaven and earth draw forth lead and replenish mercury to generate the myriad things, thereby attaining longevity. On the winter solstice, the yang *qi* within the earth ascends to heaven—this is heaven and earth flying the essence of metal, or the extraction of lead. On the summer solstice, the yin *qi* within heaven descends to earth—this is heaven and earth drawing forth mercury. Heaven and earth invert a single *qi* to become spring, summer, autumn, and winter, wood, fire, earth, metal, and water, with the four seasons complete. Only *wu-ji* (earth) is formless, revolving with the four seasons. As Master Lü said: *\"The essence of the Five Phases resides in a single womb.\"* The *Yinfu Jing* states: *\"Observe the Dao of heaven, grasp the workings of heaven—this is perfection.\"*\n\nThe two words \"lead\" and \"mercury\" have more than one meaning; their transformations are manifold and cannot be fixed. Mercury is born from cinnabar, corresponding to the rooster in the sun. The rooster is yin, and yin is mercury. Black lead corresponds to the hare in the moon; the hare is yang, and yang is lead.\n\nThere are five ranks of immortals: celestial immortals, earthly immortals, ghost immortals, human immortals, and divine immortals. Only celestial immortals achieve perfection in both form and spirit, merging with the true Dao. When gathered, they take form; when dispersed, they are boundless. As Master Lü’s poem says: *\"A single grain of the golden elixir ensures longevity—only true lead can refine *jia-geng* (metal).\"*\n\nThe Old Man of Three Peaks, known as Liu Baoyi, traveled the four seas and questioned countless false teachers, yet among ten thousand, scarcely one or two were of the same Dao. All who study the Dao must fully grasp both *xing* and *ming*. Carefully examining the direct and essential scriptures of the immortals who attained the Dao through the ages, I have composed this *Chart of Celestial Immortality*, now revealing the celestial mechanism of long life and deathlessness to the world. May the wise and discerning apply their minds and intentions, scrutinizing and inquiring deeply—further details are provided in the subsequent transmission.\n\nThe method of projecting *xing* and *ming* to produce a yin spirit is the lesser accomplishment of ghost immortals. The oral formula states: *\"It does not lie in verbose speech.\"*\n\nFor those who cultivate immortality and study the Dao, the first step is to recognize the root-source of *xing* and *ming*. This root-source is the human heart and kidneys. The kidneys are the root of *ming*, and the heart is the source of *xing*. In men and women, the inner kidneys are the root of *ming*, and the heart is the source of *xing*. The *xing* and *ming* of a person are the spirit and *qi* within the heart and kidneys. The heart is the dwelling of spirit, and the kidneys are the abode of *qi*. Spirit originally resides in the heart, but the heart belongs to yin *qi*, whose root is tied to the kidneys, which belong to yang.\n\nSpirit is the child of *qi*, and *qi* is the mother of spirit. Spirit and *qi* are but a false mother and child. Spirit is *xing*, and *qi* is *ming*; spirit and *qi* are but a false *xing* and *ming*. Moreover, spirit manifests in the eyes as sight, in the ears as hearing, in the tongue as speech, in the nose as smell, in the hands as grasping, and in the feet as walking. By day it takes the form of thought, and by night it becomes dreams. When dispersed, it is intent; when gathered, it is *qi*. Its gathering and scattering leave no trace. Within, it governs the body; without, it pervades the boundless void—encompassing heaven and earth in its vastness, yet entering a mustard seed in its subtlety. When intent is firmly held in the heart, spirit rests in tranquility within the lower *dantian*. The oral formula states: *\"If essence does not scatter, spirit will not depart.\"*\n\nThe heart must not be employed, nor intent stirred. Using the heart stirs intent; stirring intent displaces spirit; displacing spirit scatters *qi*; scattering *qi* leads to the loss of spirit. As the *Book of Changes* says: *\"That which is unfathomable in yin and yang is called spirit.\"* Master Liu’s poem states: *\"A still heart is the path to heaven; a restless intent is the gate to hell.\"*\n\nThe two words *xing* and *ming* are like jade concealed within rough stone. Only when encountered by a skilled craftsman, chiseled and split open, can work begin. To commence this work, one must steadfastly guard with sincerity throughout the twelve hours of the day. With time, natural mastery will come.\n\nIn daily life, when eating, remain composed; forget all affairs. Retire to a quiet chamber, spread a thick sitting mat, loosen your belt, cross your palms over your knees, sit upright, and let no thought arise. Day and night, do not sleep, so that spirit and *xing* remain ever luminous. The eyes should not gaze upon objects, the ears should not heed sounds, the mouth should be tightly closed, and the breath through the nose should be as if present, as if absent—never interrupted. With single-minded focus, hold spirit within, directing perception and awareness solely to the lower *dantian*, one *cun* and three *fen* below the navel. Settle the heart and stabilize intent; do not allow them to scatter. Embrace and guard the original yang true *qi*—this is the true Dao of nurturing life and attaining longevity, the wondrous method of transcending death and entering life, the very furnace of immortality.\n\nHere, in the lower *dantian*, settle the heart and stabilize intent. Remain in a state of dim, silent continuity, unbroken and ceaseless. With daily accumulation of practice, results will manifest over time. Students of the Dao, from ancient times to the present, have rarely encountered enlightened teachers. To settle the heart and stabilize intent, restraining the \"monkey-mind\" and \"horse-intent,\" is the greatest challenge in learning the Dao—a suffering within suffering. Yet if one meets a wise and skilled master who transmits the oral formula, one will naturally apply it in daily life within the lower *dantian*, settling the heart and stabilizing intent, taming the restless mind and wandering thoughts. This method is akin to keeping pigs, sheep, cattle, or horses in a pen.\n\nOne must not engage in visualization outside the body, nor observe anything beyond it, nor imagine encompassing heaven and earth. If the intent of the empty void departs from true *xing*, its destination unknown, one is left with only an empty dwelling. The lower *dantian*, however, is one’s own creation—the blessed land and cave heaven of immortals and sages. Within the lower *dantian* reside true yin and true yang, and a golden essence weighing one *jin*—the mother of immortals.\n\nIf students of the Dao do not settle the heart and stabilize intent within the lower *dantian*, it is like an infant without a mother, left to wander astray, or a lost traveler who strays further from the path. The *Scripture of Ascending to Heaven* states: *\"Direct your contemplation to the fields of the body, the five viscera and six bowels. Observe inwardly with the heart and eyes the true *qi* that resides there—pure, still, luminous, and radiant in empty whiteness.\"* Master Liu’s verse says: *\"Let the heart be free of杂念, and intent not wander afield. Following this in cultivation, what more could one seek?\"*\n\nIf one can forget schemes and sever thoughts, practicing diligently—like a hen brooding over eggs or a dung beetle rolling its ball, forming it with concentrated thought—without interruption, constantly guarding *qi* with spirit and spirit with *qi*, so that spirit and *qi* mutually guard each other and gather in the lower *dantian*, they will coalesce into the embryo of an immortal. With unwavering focus, one may enter samadhi, and from within samadhi, project the yin spirit—reaching a thousand or ten thousand *li* as if extending an arm. When the yin spirit departs, it sees others, but others do not see it. This is the cultivation of the nameless ghostly barrier, with no place of return. It may enter a womb or seize a body, becoming a refined ghost, yet not a pure yang immortal. This is called \"projecting the yin spirit,\" the method of lesser accomplishment.\n\nThe true *xing* and *ming* projecting the yang spirit is the method of great accomplishment for celestial immortals. The oral formula states: *\"It does not lie in verbose speech.\"*\n\nFor those who cultivate longevity and immortality, refining the golden elixir of dragon and tiger, the first step is to recognize the root-source of *xing* and *ming*. This root-source lies in the *Li* and *Kan* trigrams. The *Li* and *Kan* trigrams represent the heart and kidneys. In humans, the heart corresponds to the *Li* trigram, and the kidneys to the *Kan* trigram. The *Li* and *Kan* trigrams are the root-source of *xing* and *ming*. The true *xing* and *ming* of a person are the lead and mercury within *Kan* and *Li*. Lead and mercury are the dragon and tiger. The *Li* trigram generates eight *liang* of mercury—mercury is the dragon. The *Kan* trigram generates eight *liang* of lead—lead is the tiger. The *Li* trigram conceals the dragon, and the *Kan* trigram conceals the tiger. As Master Lü says: *\"The yang dragon originally emerges from the *Li* palace; the yin tiger returns from within *Kan*.\"* The *Li* trigram belongs to the south, to the *bing* and *ding* fire. The *Kan* trigram belongs to the north, to the *ren* and *gui* water. As Master Zhongli says: *\"Water conceals the white tiger; fire conceals the dragon. Since ancient times, immortals have arisen from this.\"* Master Taibai says: *\"The art of inverting the Five Phases: the dragon emerges from within fire; the Five Phases do not follow their usual course—the tiger is born from within water.\"*\n\nThe two words *xing* and *ming* encompass many layers of meaning. They may be called water and fire, metal and wood, husband and wife, sun and moon—with countless variations and names beyond enumeration. The oral formula states: *\"They are merely the two words *essence* and *blood* within the heart and kidneys.\"*\n\nThe heart is the sea of blood; the kidneys are the sea of essence. The heart is the source of blood; the kidneys are the root of essence. Essence is lead; blood is mercury. Mercury is born in the south, in *bing* and *ding* fire, belonging to yang. Lead is born in the north, in *ren* and *gui* water, belonging to yin. True *xing* and *ming* are merely the two principles of yin and yang. Yang is *xing*; yin is *ming*. If one speaks directly of yin and yang, yang is only yang, and yin is only yin. The mercury within *Li* is *xing*; the lead within *Kan* is *ming*. If one speaks of yin and yang in inversion, yang becomes yin, and yin becomes yang. The lead within *Kan*, though below, is *xing*; the mercury within *Li*, though above, is *ming*. To speak of yin and yang in inversion is to align with the transformative principles of heaven and earth, sun and moon.\n\nLead is the mother of mercury; mercury is the child of lead. Lead and mercury are the true mother and child. Lead is *xing*; mercury is *ming*. Lead and mercury are the true *xing* and *ming*. Heaven and earth have no heart and kidneys—they take the sun and moon as their heart and kidneys. Humans have no sun and moon—they take the heart and kidneys as their sun and moon. Within the sun is the rooster, the trigram *Li* belonging to the southern maiden, yang concealing yin. Within the moon is the hare, the trigram *Kan* belonging to the northern youth, yin concealing yang. *Li* conceals eight *liang* of mercury, resembling the sun’s brilliance. *Kan* conceals eight *liang* of lead, resembling the hare in the moon.\n\nThe heart resembles the sun; the kidneys resemble the moon. The yin and yang within the heart and kidneys mirror the transformations of the sun and moon. Master Lü says: *\"When asked about the method of cultivation, I point to the sun and moon on the horizon.\"* The moon’s waxing and waning: on the first day of the month, the moon generates one *liang* of gold. From the second to the eighth day, the moon generates eight *liang* of gold. When the moon is like a drawn bow, neither high nor low, it is half a *jin*—this is called the first quarter. After another seven days, including the previous eight, a total of fifteen days, the yang generation reaches fullness. On the sixteenth day, the yang number gradually diminishes, and the yin begins to grow. Over eight days, until the twenty-third day, the moon is again like a drawn bow, neither high nor low, half a *jin*—this is called the last quarter. The first quarter is eight *liang*, the last quarter is eight *liang*. The first quarter is gold and fire; the last quarter is silver and water. The first and last quarters are yin and yang, dragon and tiger, with endless transformations beyond full description.\n\nMaster Wang says: *\"The first quarter is gold; the last quarter is silver. Each is half a *jin*, together making sixteen *liang*. How are the stars within balanced?\"* Master Liu Haichan says: *\"Let me explain the Great Return Elixir: its five-colored form is round like a pellet. Two ingredients combine to make sixteen *liang*, encircled by the fire of the celestial cycle.\"* Master Zhongli says: *\"The two images together make one *jin*, yin and yang restraining each other to transform into truth.\"*\n\nAll who study the Dao must, upon encountering an enlightened teacher or true companion, never squander the teachings personally transmitted by teacher or friend. They must urgently begin cultivation: harmonizing the Four Images, gathering the Five Phases, matching lead and mercury, uniting the two eights, circulating the fire of the celestial cycle, and refining them into sixteen *liang* of radiant, crimson Dragon-Tiger Golden Elixir, shaped like a pellet and colored like a red tangerine, corresponding to the *jin* measure of heaven and earth. Each *liang* contains twenty-four *zhu*, aligning with the 384 lines of the celestial cycle.\n\nThose who cultivate must first stabilize and nourish spirit and qi. Spirit and qi are the true *wu* and *ji* earth. *Wu* and *ji* are the matchmakers, the Yellow Dame. *Wu* earth is the qi within *Kan*; *ji* earth is the spirit within *Li*. When spirit and qi are not scattered, lead and mercury naturally pair, and the crow and hare do not part, refining into a single pellet of Dragon-Tiger Golden Elixir.\n\nMaster Zhongli says: *\"Lead and mercury are the foundation of the elixir. Without *wu* and *ji*, the elixir cannot form. The three families unite as the true seed, and only then does the Golden Elixir reveal its return.\"* Those who mistakenly take the spleen as *wu* and *ji*, the Yellow Dame, or the matchmaker, refer to false *wu* and *ji*.\n\nThose who cultivate must first recognize that the fire for refining the elixir has three grades, divided into inner and outer fires. Outer fire has form and image; it can refine the five metals, transform the five grains, and nourish all beings—this fire cannot refine the elixir. The fire for refining the elixir lies within. Inner fire has no form or image; when kindled, it has flame. It relies on the qi of the five grains to generate true fire. Essence is the fire of the people; qi is the fire of the ministers; the heart is the fire of the sovereign. Sovereign fire is spirit fire; spirit fire is *xing* fire. Only *xing* fire must not be kindled or used. If *xing* fire is kindled, it is like fire born from wood, burning the body itself. This fire must not be used or stirred. If stirred, it is the stirring of spirit; if spirit stirs, qi stirs; if qi stirs, essence stirs. When *xing* fire is unstirred, spirit is settled; when spirit is settled, qi is settled; when qi is settled, essence is settled. Once the three fires are settled, they converge in the lower elixir field, gathering to heat the golden crucible and forge the jade furnace, steaming the gates and orifices. This causes the yin in the body to dissipate and the yang to grow, the true yang qi circulating in inversion above and below, naturally refining into a single pellet of radiant, crimson Dragon-Tiger Golden Elixir.\n\n*xing* and *ming* are like jade hidden in stone. Only when encountered by a skilled craftsman’s chisel can they be separated and revealed, allowing work to begin without harming the person’s *xing* and *ming*. To begin this work, one must first follow the method of emerging yin spirit, achieving minor attainment as the initial step from small to great.\n\nHeaven and Earth possess their natural qi, and qi has its natural numerical order. Humans receive the qi of Heaven and Earth to be born, their qi and numerical order equal to those of Heaven and Earth. Those who cultivate the Dao delve into the root of creation and transformation, knowing the pathways of yin and yang’s ascent and descent. They can settle the mind and stabilize the intent within the lower elixir field, so that not a single thought arises, and they abide in serene desirelessness.\n\nFrom midnight, the hour of *zi*, when the first yang is born, the primordial yang golden essence in the lower elixir field naturally transforms into qi of five colors, moving like raging fire, resembling a scorching wind. It pierces through the *Weilü* acupoint, strikes through the three barriers, and ascends straight to the *Niwan* Palace at the crown. Descending again to the lower elixir field, it returns once more through the *Weilü* acupoint. The harmonious qi surges forth, ambrosia pours over the crown, the Yellow River flows backward, and the four substances—spirit, qi, essence, and blood—merge into one qi, circulating in inversion above and below, endlessly revolving. This naturally aligns with the fire phases of the celestial cycle, forging a single pellet of radiant, crimson Dragon-Tiger Golden Elixir.\n\nOnce the Golden Elixir is formed, the yang spirit manifests. This yang spirit is the sacred embryo. To speak of the sacred embryo is to speak of the Golden Elixir; the Golden Elixir is the sacred embryo. The sacred embryo’s process of formation differs not from that of the ordinary embryo. The ordinary embryo is merely the creation of a person through the union of the parents’ lead and mercury. Lead is the father’s essence, mercury the mother’s blood; their union creates a person. Comparing the ordinary to the sacred reveals the inner through the outer.\n\nThe sacred embryo depends entirely on the extraction of lead and the addition of mercury. Thus, to extract lead is for the true qi of the lower elixir field to ascend directly into the upper elixir field—also called the turning of the river chariot, or the flight of golden essence behind the elbow—upward to replenish the brain, known as extracting lead to add mercury. The golden essence flies from behind the elbow to replenish the brain; when replenished to sufficiency, it flows like liquid gold, descending from the crown. Its taste is sweet, its fragrance fragrant. Swallowed, it passes through the twelve-storied tower of the throat, striking the lungs. The lungs belong to the west, to *geng* and *xin* metal, their color white. Water returns as saliva; the lungs have two qi channels through which qi flows into the heart. The heart belongs to the south, to *bing* and *ding* fire, its color red. Saliva returns as blood, and blood is mercury—this is called adding mercury with lead, or lead giving birth to mercury.\n\nThe heart has two qi channels that pour into the kidneys. The kidneys belong to the north, to *ren* and *gui* water, their color black. Blood returns as essence, and essence is lead—this is called mercury giving birth to lead. Those who cultivate and study must practice day and night without interruption, extracting lead and adding mercury. After ten months, the sacred embryo is decisively perfected. As the Perfected Zhang Pingshu said in his poem: *\"The infant is a vessel of true qi; after ten months, the embryo is complete, entering the foundation of the sacred.\"* Another half-verse from *The Moon Over the West River* reads: *\"Wood’s nature loves metal’s righteousness; metal’s affection cherishes wood’s benevolence. Swallowing and devouring each other, they become intimate—only then does one realize a man may conceive.\"*\n\nIf the Five Phases are not inverted, dragon and tiger do not unite; if the three fields do not return and reverse, the sacred embryo will not be perfected. After one hundred days of extracting lead and adding mercury, the medicinal power is complete. After two hundred days, the sacred embryo is firm. After three hundred days, the sacred embryo is fully formed, with limbs, five viscera, sinews, and bones all complete. Suddenly, there is movement—below the navel, in the elixir field, it stirs like the movement of a woman with child. Nurturing the embryo for ten months, it emerges like a golden cicada shedding its shell, a body outside the body. The yang spirit appears, its infant form fresh and pure, its spirit luminous, its body like empty space—gathering, it takes shape; scattering, it is boundless.\n\nNext, one must learn to guide the spirit out of the shell. The spirit steps out a few paces, turns to observe the old body, and sees nothing—if seen, it appears like a dung heap, repulsive in myriad ways. The spirit roams far in an instant; at first, do not go too far. Initially, one step, two steps; later, two *li*, three *li*. With accumulated days, entering and exiting become effortless, a thousand *li* or ten thousand *li* like extending an arm—this is called the emergence of the yang spirit. This is the method of perfecting the celestial immortal, the art of attaining eternal life.\n\n**Diagram of the Golden Cicada Shedding Its Shell for the Celestial Immortal**\n**Oral Instructions:**\nThose who cultivate eternal life and forge the Dragon-Tiger Golden Elixir must first know the pathways of yin and yang’s ascent and descent before they can begin. Extracting lead and adding mercury, soaring with the sun and moon, reversing and restoring the true qi of yin and yang, circulating in inversion above and below, endlessly revolving—naturally, a pellet of Dragon-Tiger Golden Elixir is forged.\n\nThe human spine has twenty-four vertebrae. Counting from the bottom, the first vertebra below is called the *Weilü* acupoint, also known as the Dragon-Tiger acupoint, the Caoxi Path, the Ninefold Iron Drum, the Three-Pronged Bone, the River Chariot Bone, the River Chariot Path, the Qi Sea Gate, the Heavenward Ridge, or the Ladder to Heaven. The *Weilü* acupoint resembles a golden crucible, with nine apertures inside and out, all interconnected. Along the spine’s center and on either side, there are three pathways. One surges straight up to the *Niwan* Palace at the crown; from the *Niwan* Palace, it descends back to the lower elixir field, then returns through the *Weilü* acupoint—this is the ascending pathway from behind. The *Niwan* Palace is the descending pathway from the front. The *Niwan* Palace and *Weilü* acupoint are the pathways of yin and yang’s ascent and descent.\n\nThe human spine has three barriers: the *Weilü* acupoint is called the lower barrier, comprising three vertebrae. Counting from the third vertebra of the lower barrier to the eighteenth vertebra is the middle barrier. From the eighteenth vertebra of the middle barrier to the *Yuzhen* barrier and the three vertebrae of the great vertebra up to the *Niwan* Palace is the upper barrier.\n\nThese are the names of the three barriers.\n\nThe Perfected One Who Parts the Clouds composed a poem:\nBreaking through the three barriers, the spirit settles in serenity,\nPiercing the nine orifices, the qi flows in harmony.\nThe celestial fire’s timing knows no stagnation—\nAt midnight, wild and ecstatic, one sings alone.\n\nLearned cultivators, when examining the skeletal remains within tombs, observe the *Weilü* acupoint: the bone’s aperture appears thus, with no other distinction.\n\nThe Perfected Lü Dongbin composed a poem:\nThe *Weilü*’s nine orifices are an iron drum,\nThe celestial fire’s timing, a bow and arrow.\nWhen the iron drum is struck through, the achievement is no small feat—\nA single torrent of the Yellow River surges up and down.\n\n*Illustration of the Weilü Bone*\n\nRefining the golden elixir,\nOne overturns the furnace of creation.\nA wheel of shadowless moon—\nHeaven and earth cannot contain it.\n\n*Seven-character quatrains, sixteen in total, corresponding to the weight of one catty in the cosmos.*\n\nGreen Dragon and White Tiger, each to the west and east,\nThe two beasts seized and simmered within the cauldron.\nAfter nine refinements, the great medicine is complete—\nA single grain of golden elixir glows red at the crown.\n\nThe Infant sits within the Water of Kan,\nThe Maiden dwells within the Fire of Li.\nWhen the Maiden and Infant are matched as husband and wife,\nAfter ten months, a pearl of unchanging countenance is born.\n\nWho would believe a man could bear a womb?\nClearly, below the navel, an infant is conceived.\nWith four limbs, five viscera, and bones formed,\nThe golden embryo sheds its shell to ascend Penglai.\n\nLong life does not lie in mere words—\nInstead, from Kan and Li, gather mercury and lead.\nRefine the fire elixir to sixteen ounces,\nAnd the Heavenly Immortal’s decree is received by the Jade Emperor’s proclamation.\n\nWhen the Dragon and Tiger complete the ninefold refinement,\nThey can drive the sun and moon to course east and west.\nIf one knows the method of withdrawing and adding fire,\nThe golden liquid and returned elixir fill the crown with red.\n\nFire is drawn from the south’s crimson Dragon’s blood,\nWater sought from the northern sea’s black Tiger’s essence.\nWhen the two substances harmonize in one place,\nThe Infant is nurtured to ensure enduring life.\n\nRoaming the western lands in clouds of water,\nOne recognizes true gold—firm and unyielding.\nAfter refining the great elixir and swallowing it,\nWithin the Palace of Five Lights, one lingers in ease.\n\nThe heart is like the bright moon, clear as the boundless sky,\nThe nature akin to a cold pond’s still waters.\nIn the twelve hours, ever aware and luminous—\nDo not let the master within be obscured.\n\nAmidst the world’s myriad scenes and entanglements,\nOne responds to phenomena with carefree joy.\nPolishing the mind-ground until no speck remains—\nLike a lotus rising unstained from the mire.\n\nWhere one walks, the moon of the heart illumines all illusions,\nWhere one abides, the pearl of spirit shines in the ten directions.\nIn seated stillness, one observes true freedom,\nIn repose, do not extinguish the light before the eyes.\n\nNature and life are two distinct matters,\nNeither branch from the same leaf.\nThe nature’s school reaches the ghostly immortals of yin,\nWhile refining life, the yang spirit transcends birth and death.\n\nThe sun and moon are clearly explained to the wise:\nThe horse and ape are firmly locked within the elixir field.\nThe nature of true emptiness and awakening remains ever unobscured—\nWhen the ninefold refinement is complete, one is destined to become an immortal.\n\nBreaking through the three barriers seizes the sacred mechanism,\nPiercing the nine orifices ascends the ladder to heaven.\nThe Yellow River reverses its flow without stagnation—\nA pair of golden cicadas soar up and down.\n\nWearing jade blossoms upon the crown is most wondrous,\nSeizing the natural mechanism of creation.\nAt the mountain’s summit, the sun and moon take flight—\nYet in this dusty world, none comprehend.\n\nThe river chariot rolls ceaselessly past the three barriers,\nTransporting jade blossoms without a moment’s rest.\nTo replenish the *Niwan* Palace within—\nFreely one ascends the Jade Capital Mountain.\n\nMaster Liu Daizi, adorned with flowers, rides a dragon and straddles a tiger to strike the golden ball.\nWhen I transport it into the heavenly palace,\nI win three thousand eight hundred tally marks.\n\n*The Elixir Formula of the Old Man of Three Peaks, Embracing the One, concludes.*\n\n**Annotations:**\n1.

      "translated_text": "**The Alchemical Secrets of Master Baoyi of Sanfeng: A Daoist Manual**\n\n*Title:* *The Alchemical Secrets of Master Baoyi of Sanfeng*\nCompiled by Yuan Jin Yueyan, transmitted by Huang Gongwang. One scroll.\n*Source:* *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongzhen* section, *Zhongshu* category.\n\n**The Alchemical Secrets of Master Baoyi of Sanfeng**\nIncludes *Oral Instructions on the Golden Cicada Shedding Its Shell and Ascending as a Heavenly Immortal* by Master Liu, *Oral Instructions on the True and False Nature of Life*, sixteen heptasyllabic quatrains on the *Weilü* point—matching the weight of heaven and earth in a single catty—and a preface by the author.\n\nSince Pangu divided heaven and earth, to this very day, the cycle of human rebirth has known no end. Alas! The human body is hard to obtain, yet time flashes by like lightning. In youth, one refuses to awaken; in old age, one resigns to awaiting death. If at the final moment a single thought strays, one is cast into the six paths of rebirth. The true nature enters another shell, and though one may pass through ten thousand kalpas, escape remains impossible. At such a time, what use is regret?\n\nYet most who aspire to the Dao through the ages fail to meet a true master and receive oral transmission. Instead, they cling to misguided notions and fall into delusion. Some eat pine needles and cypress leaves; some drink water and swallow talismans; some swallow saliva and spit; some exhale the old and inhale the new; some absorb the essence of the sun and moon; some practice massage and daoyin; some observe fasts and abstain from grain; some blindly cultivate and recklessly refine; some press the tongue to the palate and still the heart. All these methods are but side doors and minor arts, unrelated to the cultivation of true nature and life.\n\nLittle do they know that the term \"nature and life\" itself has true and false forms. The true nature and life give rise to the yang spirit. The yang spirit is the method of attaining the great perfection of a heavenly immortal. The false nature and life give rise to the yin spirit. The yin spirit is the minor attainment of a ghostly immortal. How laughable are those who cultivate the yin spirit! Ignorant and unlearned, they fail to grasp the techniques of withdrawing lead and adding mercury, or the art of refining the great elixir of golden cinnabar. How could they know the methods of subduing the dragon and taming the tiger?\n\nInstead, they foolishly engage in internal visualization, focusing on the lower dantian, calming the mind and stabilizing intention, nurturing spirit and qi, claiming success in their endeavors, imagining the formation of the golden elixir within, and seeking the great medicine through mere thought. Such practices are no different from child’s play. Unaware of true lead and true mercury, they mistake spirit and qi for nature and life—like claiming another’s wealth as their own or calling a child of another surname their own kin.\n\nAs the saying goes: \"Wealth gained in a dream cannot sustain one; a cake drawn on the ground cannot fill the stomach.\" All is emptiness within emptiness, like flowers in a mirror or the moon in water—ultimately, nothing is achieved. Those who, ignorant of the method of the golden elixir and great medicine, cling to internal visualization and contemplation are dismissed by the wise and extraordinary.\n\nThe Immortal of Longevity once wrote:\n*\"If the embryonic immortal could be formed through mere thought,\nThen even a maiden without a husband could conceive.\"*\n\nZhang Ping Shu said:\n*\"No matter how much you practice breath control and visualization,\nIt is entirely different from the work of the golden elixir.\"*\n\nAnd the True Man Zhongli Quan declared:\n*\"Without true lead and mercury, the elixir of return cannot be attained,\nAnd one will sink for ten thousand kalpas into the realm of death.\"*\n\nThis is the truth.\n\nFor beginners on the Daoist path, the mind is like a restless monkey and the intention like a galloping horse, racing without pause. Fearful of losing their resolve amidst external distractions, they close their ears to sound, avert their eyes from sights, calm their minds, and steady their intentions. They practice internal visualization, focusing on the lower dantian, calming the mind and stabilizing intention, nurturing spirit and qi. This practice must not be neglected, nor should one become attached to it, nor should it be lightly employed for minor purposes.\n\nThe terms \"lead\" and \"mercury\" do not refer to spirit and qi. Lead and mercury have weight; how can spirit and qi be weighed? Lead and mercury can be withdrawn and added; how can spirit and qi be spoken of in such terms?\n\nThere are also those who, in their cultivation, fail to properly nurture spirit and qi, ignorant even of minor methods, yet stubbornly cling to vast, empty notions. They claim to do nothing, asserting that the great Dao is formless and imageless, originally without lack or excess—so what is there to cultivate? When hungry, they eat; when full, they sleep. Such cultivators, in the end, are like withered trees sprouting mad blossoms—no different from a lost traveler wandering in the night. How pitiful!\n\nYet if the great Dao is truly without words or form, what manner of cultivation did Ancestor Wang encounter when he met the True Man Lü at Ganhe Town? When a cultivator completes the great medicine of the golden elixir, its light illuminates the ten directions, its brilliance pervades the four seas. When gathered, it takes form; when scattered, it is boundless—capable of a thousand transformations and ten thousand changes. This is the great Dao.\n\nMen possess internal kidneys, which lie opposite the navel, adhering to the spine—these are the two kidneys. The primordial yang and golden essence of man arise from the internal kidneys. The internal kidneys are also called the *Reclining Moon Furnace* or *Jade Furnace*. The heart is the golden tripod. The internal and external kidneys together form the *Kan* trigram. One must never purify the body by removing the external kidneys, for this would damage one’s natural endowment and make attaining the Dao impossible.\n\nThe kidneys are the master of the five viscera. Man has three palaces and three fields: the crown of the head is the *Mud Pill*, called the upper dantian; the heart is the *Crimson Palace*, called the middle dantian; one *cun* and three *fen* below the navel is the *Yellow Court Palace*, called the lower dantian. This is the chamber for nurturing the sacred embryo and the furnace for refining the great medicine of the golden elixir.\n\nMan has five viscera, each containing an essence, and all five essences gather in the lower dantian. The lower dantian is green on the left, white on the right, red above, black below, and yellow at the center. The lower dantian is also called the *Palace of Five Lights*, the *Precious Vase Palace*, the *Palace of Water Essence*, the *Furnace of the Five Phases*, the *Dragon Pool*, the *Phoenix Pool*, the *Jade Pool*, the *Elixir Pool*, the *Flower Pool*, the *Pool of Seven Treasures*, the *Anavatapta Pool*, the *Land of Golden Profit*, and the *Sea of Qi*.",

      "translated_text": "The human heart corresponds to the southern *bing-ding* fire, while the kidneys correspond to the northern *ren-gui* water—these are but provisional water and fire. The lead and mercury within the heart and kidneys are the true *Kan* (☵) and *Li* (☲). For those who cultivate immortality and study the Dao, the first task is to recognize the guest and host of *xing* (nature) and *ming* (life).\n\nIn the household of *xing*, when the mind-monkey is let loose and lost abroad, it serves as the guest; when awakened and returned home, neither dull nor deluded, neither swaying nor moving, it becomes the host—this is the guest and host of *xing*. In the household of *ming*, mercury, symbolizing wood and fire, the dragon, floats in *Li* as the guest; lead, symbolizing metal and water, the tiger, sinks in *Kan* as the host. As Zhang Pingshu said: *\"Who knows the inversion of Kan and Li, or discerns the floating and sinking to determine guest and host?\"* The Supreme Lord said: *\"Take lead as the sovereign, mercury as the minister; if lead is not true, mercury cannot be stabilized.\"* Lead is the master of transformation—this is the guest and host of *ming*.\n\nMoreover, lead and mercury may be true or false, existing within the wondrous subtleties of the human body’s refinement of the great medicine of the golden elixir. True lead and mercury were born before heaven and earth; false lead and mercury arose after them. True lead and mercury are formless transformation; false lead and mercury are formed transformation.\n\nTrue lead and mercury existed before the void of heaven and earth—these are the formless *geng-xin* true metal of the West. Metal is lead, and lead gives birth to mercury. Lead and mercury are the formless *ren-gui* true water of the North. When lead obtains mercury, it takes form, gradually giving rise to heaven and earth, the sun and moon, mountains and seas, human relationships, and all the myriad things. Metal is the mother of water, the mother concealed within the child’s womb; water is the child of metal, the child hidden within the mother’s belly. Metal’s body is hard and unyielding, impervious to decay—it is the root of metal, the foundation of the great elixir’s firmness. True metal is the mother of all things. As the *Daodejing* says: *\"Nameless, it is the beginning of heaven and earth; named, it is the mother of the myriad things.\"*\n\nTian Zhenhuangren’s commentary on the *Yinfu Jing* states: *\"The One is the root of heaven and earth, the mother of yin and yang. All things take it as their model for generation, and the thousand spirits respond to it with joy or sorrow. It is born in the high heavens and the deep earth, in grotto heavens and immortal mountains, in the numinous palaces of the mysterious realm. None among the divine immortals and sages lack something generated by the qi of lead.\"* If one can refine lead into *qi*, then the myriad spirits arise of themselves—hence, one does not die.\n\nAs for the forging of lead and mercury, these are black tin and quicksilver. Black tin is lead, and quicksilver is mercury; black tin is the mother of the five metals, while quicksilver is the thief of the five metals. Black lead transforms into yellow cinnabar—this is yin returning to yang. Yellow cinnabar reverts to black tin—this is yang returning to yin. Quicksilver transforms into vermilion—this is yin returning to yang. Vermilion reverts to quicksilver—this is yang returning to yin. Black tin transforms into refined powder, and quicksilver into light powder. These two substances, quicksilver and black tin, each contain the Five Phases of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth, giving rise to the five colors: green, red, yellow, white, and black. Though black tin and quicksilver are false lead and mercury, they resemble the transformations of heaven, earth, and humanity.\n\nHeaven and earth draw forth lead and replenish mercury to generate the myriad things, thereby attaining longevity. On the winter solstice, the yang *qi* within the earth ascends to heaven—this is heaven and earth flying the essence of metal, or the extraction of lead. On the summer solstice, the yin *qi* within heaven descends to earth—this is heaven and earth drawing forth mercury. Heaven and earth invert a single *qi* to become spring, summer, autumn, and winter, wood, fire, earth, metal, and water, with the four seasons complete. Only *wu-ji* (earth) is formless, revolving with the four seasons. As Master Lü said: *\"The essence of the Five Phases resides in a single womb.\"* The *Yinfu Jing* states: *\"Observe the Dao of heaven, grasp the workings of heaven—this is perfection.\"*\n\nThe two words \"lead\" and \"mercury\" have more than one meaning; their transformations are manifold and cannot be fixed. Mercury is born from cinnabar, corresponding to the rooster in the sun. The rooster is yin, and yin is mercury. Black lead corresponds to the hare in the moon; the hare is yang, and yang is lead.\n\nThere are five ranks of immortals: celestial immortals, earthly immortals, ghost immortals, human immortals, and divine immortals. Only celestial immortals achieve perfection in both form and spirit, merging with the true Dao. When gathered, they take form; when dispersed, they are boundless. As Master Lü’s poem says: *\"A single grain of the golden elixir ensures longevity—only true lead can refine *jia-geng* (metal).\"*\n\nThe Old Man of Three Peaks, known as Liu Baoyi, traveled the four seas and questioned countless false teachers, yet among ten thousand, scarcely one or two were of the same Dao. All who study the Dao must fully grasp both *xing* and *ming*. Carefully examining the direct and essential scriptures of the immortals who attained the Dao through the ages, I have composed this *Chart of Celestial Immortality*, now revealing the celestial mechanism of long life and deathlessness to the world. May the wise and discerning apply their minds and intentions, scrutinizing and inquiring deeply—further details are provided in the subsequent transmission.\n\nThe method of projecting *xing* and *ming* to produce a yin spirit is the lesser accomplishment of ghost immortals. The oral formula states: *\"It does not lie in verbose speech.\"*\n\nFor those who cultivate immortality and study the Dao, the first step is to recognize the root-source of *xing* and *ming*. This root-source is the human heart and kidneys. The kidneys are the root of *ming*, and the heart is the source of *xing*. In men and women, the inner kidneys are the root of *ming*, and the heart is the source of *xing*. The *xing* and *ming* of a person are the spirit and *qi* within the heart and kidneys. The heart is the dwelling of spirit, and the kidneys are the abode of *qi*. Spirit originally resides in the heart, but the heart belongs to yin *qi*, whose root is tied to the kidneys, which belong to yang.",

      "translated_text": "Spirit is the child of *qi*, and *qi* is the mother of spirit. Spirit and *qi* are but a false mother and child. Spirit is *xing*, and *qi* is *ming*; spirit and *qi* are but a false *xing* and *ming*. Moreover, spirit manifests in the eyes as sight, in the ears as hearing, in the tongue as speech, in the nose as smell, in the hands as grasping, and in the feet as walking. By day it takes the form of thought, and by night it becomes dreams. When dispersed, it is intent; when gathered, it is *qi*. Its gathering and scattering leave no trace. Within, it governs the body; without, it pervades the boundless void—encompassing heaven and earth in its vastness, yet entering a mustard seed in its subtlety. When intent is firmly held in the heart, spirit rests in tranquility within the lower *dantian*. The oral formula states: *\"If essence does not scatter, spirit will not depart.\"*\n\nThe heart must not be employed, nor intent stirred. Using the heart stirs intent; stirring intent displaces spirit; displacing spirit scatters *qi*; scattering *qi* leads to the loss of spirit. As the *Book of Changes* says: *\"That which is unfathomable in yin and yang is called spirit.\"* Master Liu’s poem states: *\"A still heart is the path to heaven; a restless intent is the gate to hell.\"*\n\nThe two words *xing* and *ming* are like jade concealed within rough stone. Only when encountered by a skilled craftsman, chiseled and split open, can work begin. To commence this work, one must steadfastly guard with sincerity throughout the twelve hours of the day. With time, natural mastery will come.\n\nIn daily life, when eating, remain composed; forget all affairs. Retire to a quiet chamber, spread a thick sitting mat, loosen your belt, cross your palms over your knees, sit upright, and let no thought arise. Day and night, do not sleep, so that spirit and *xing* remain ever luminous. The eyes should not gaze upon objects, the ears should not heed sounds, the mouth should be tightly closed, and the breath through the nose should be as if present, as if absent—never interrupted. With single-minded focus, hold spirit within, directing perception and awareness solely to the lower *dantian*, one *cun* and three *fen* below the navel. Settle the heart and stabilize intent; do not allow them to scatter. Embrace and guard the original yang true *qi*—this is the true Dao of nurturing life and attaining longevity, the wondrous method of transcending death and entering life, the very furnace of immortality.\n\nHere, in the lower *dantian*, settle the heart and stabilize intent. Remain in a state of dim, silent continuity, unbroken and ceaseless. With daily accumulation of practice, results will manifest over time. Students of the Dao, from ancient times to the present, have rarely encountered enlightened teachers. To settle the heart and stabilize intent, restraining the \"monkey-mind\" and \"horse-intent,\" is the greatest challenge in learning the Dao—a suffering within suffering. Yet if one meets a wise and skilled master who transmits the oral formula, one will naturally apply it in daily life within the lower *dantian*, settling the heart and stabilizing intent, taming the restless mind and wandering thoughts. This method is akin to keeping pigs, sheep, cattle, or horses in a pen.\n\nOne must not engage in visualization outside the body, nor observe anything beyond it, nor imagine encompassing heaven and earth. If the intent of the empty void departs from true *xing*, its destination unknown, one is left with only an empty dwelling. The lower *dantian*, however, is one’s own creation—the blessed land and cave heaven of immortals and sages. Within the lower *dantian* reside true yin and true yang, and a golden essence weighing one *jin*—the mother of immortals.\n\nIf students of the Dao do not settle the heart and stabilize intent within the lower *dantian*, it is like an infant without a mother, left to wander astray, or a lost traveler who strays further from the path. The *Scripture of Ascending to Heaven* states: *\"Direct your contemplation to the fields of the body, the five viscera and six bowels. Observe inwardly with the heart and eyes the true *qi* that resides there—pure, still, luminous, and radiant in empty whiteness.\"* Master Liu’s verse says: *\"Let the heart be free of杂念, and intent not wander afield. Following this in cultivation, what more could one seek?\"*\n\nIf one can forget schemes and sever thoughts, practicing diligently—like a hen brooding over eggs or a dung beetle rolling its ball, forming it with concentrated thought—without interruption, constantly guarding *qi* with spirit and spirit with *qi*, so that spirit and *qi* mutually guard each other and gather in the lower *dantian*, they will coalesce into the embryo of an immortal. With unwavering focus, one may enter samadhi, and from within samadhi, project the yin spirit—reaching a thousand or ten thousand *li* as if extending an arm. When the yin spirit departs, it sees others, but others do not see it. This is the cultivation of the nameless ghostly barrier, with no place of return. It may enter a womb or seize a body, becoming a refined ghost, yet not a pure yang immortal. This is called \"projecting the yin spirit,\" the method of lesser accomplishment.\n\nThe true *xing* and *ming* projecting the yang spirit is the method of great accomplishment for celestial immortals. The oral formula states: *\"It does not lie in verbose speech.\"*\n\nFor those who cultivate longevity and immortality, refining the golden elixir of dragon and tiger, the first step is to recognize the root-source of *xing* and *ming*. This root-source lies in the *Li* and *Kan* trigrams. The *Li* and *Kan* trigrams represent the heart and kidneys. In humans, the heart corresponds to the *Li* trigram, and the kidneys to the *Kan* trigram. The *Li* and *Kan* trigrams are the root-source of *xing* and *ming*. The true *xing* and *ming* of a person are the lead and mercury within *Kan* and *Li*. Lead and mercury are the dragon and tiger. The *Li* trigram generates eight *liang* of mercury—mercury is the dragon. The *Kan* trigram generates eight *liang* of lead—lead is the tiger. The *Li* trigram conceals the dragon, and the *Kan* trigram conceals the tiger. As Master Lü says: *\"The yang dragon originally emerges from the *Li* palace; the yin tiger returns from within *Kan*.\"* The *Li* trigram belongs to the south, to the *bing* and *ding* fire. The *Kan* trigram belongs to the north, to the *ren* and *gui* water. As Master Zhongli says: *\"Water conceals the white tiger; fire conceals the dragon. Since ancient times, immortals have arisen from this.\"* Master Taibai says: *\"The art of inverting the Five Phases: the dragon emerges from within fire; the Five Phases do not follow their usual course—the tiger is born from within water.\"*\n\nThe two words *xing* and *ming* encompass many layers of meaning. They may be called water and fire, metal and wood, husband and wife, sun and moon—with countless variations and names beyond enumeration. The oral formula states: *\"They are merely the two words *essence* and *blood* within the heart and kidneys.\"*",

The heart is the dwelling of spirit, and the kidneys are the abode of *qi*. Spirit originally resides in the heart, but the heart belongs to yin *qi*, whose root is tied to the kidneys, which belong to yang.",

      "translated_text": "The heart is the sea of blood; the kidneys are the sea of essence. The heart is the source of blood; the kidneys are the root of essence. Essence is lead; blood is mercury. Mercury is born in the south, in *bing* and *ding* fire, belonging to yang. Lead is born in the north, in *ren* and *gui* water, belonging to yin. True *xing* and *ming* are merely the two principles of yin and yang. Yang is *xing*; yin is *ming*. If one speaks directly of yin and yang, yang is only yang, and yin is only yin. The mercury within *Li* is *xing*; the lead within *Kan* is *ming*. If one speaks of yin and yang in inversion, yang becomes yin, and yin becomes yang. The lead within *Kan*, though below, is *xing*; the mercury within *Li*, though above, is *ming*. To speak of yin and yang in inversion is to align with the transformative principles of heaven and earth, sun and moon.\n\nLead is the mother of mercury; mercury is the child of lead. Lead and mercury are the true mother and child. Lead is *xing*; mercury is *ming*. Lead and mercury are the true *xing* and *ming*. Heaven and earth have no heart and kidneys—they take the sun and moon as their heart and kidneys. Humans have no sun and moon—they take the heart and kidneys as their sun and moon. Within the sun is the rooster, the trigram *Li* belonging to the southern maiden, yang concealing yin. Within the moon is the hare, the trigram *Kan* belonging to the northern youth, yin concealing yang. *Li* conceals eight *liang* of mercury, resembling the sun’s brilliance. *Kan* conceals eight *liang* of lead, resembling the hare in the moon.\n\nThe heart resembles the sun; the kidneys resemble the moon. The yin and yang within the heart and kidneys mirror the transformations of the sun and moon. Master Lü says: *\"When asked about the method of cultivation, I point to the sun and moon on the horizon.\"* The moon’s waxing and waning: on the first day of the month, the moon generates one *liang* of gold. From the second to the eighth day, the moon generates eight *liang* of gold. When the moon is like a drawn bow, neither high nor low, it is half a *jin*—this is called the first quarter. After another seven days, including the previous eight, a total of fifteen days, the yang generation reaches fullness. On the sixteenth day, the yang number gradually diminishes, and the yin begins to grow. Over eight days, until the twenty-third day, the moon is again like a drawn bow, neither high nor low, half a *jin*—this is called the last quarter. The first quarter is eight *liang*, the last quarter is eight *liang*. The first quarter is gold and fire; the last quarter is silver and water. The first and last quarters are yin and yang, dragon and tiger, with endless transformations beyond full description.\n\nMaster Wang says: *\"The first quarter is gold; the last quarter is silver. Each is half a *jin*, together making sixteen *liang*. How are the stars within balanced?\"* Master Liu Haichan says: *\"Let me explain the Great Return Elixir: its five-colored form is round like a pellet. Two ingredients combine to make sixteen *liang*, encircled by the fire of the celestial cycle.\"* Master Zhongli says: *\"The two images together make one *jin*, yin and yang restraining each other to transform into truth.\"*\n\nAll who study the Dao must, upon encountering an enlightened teacher or true companion, never squander the teachings personally transmitted by teacher or friend. They must urgently begin cultivation: harmonizing the Four Images, gathering the Five Phases, matching lead and mercury, uniting the two eights, circulating the fire of the celestial cycle, and refining them into sixteen *liang* of radiant, crimson Dragon-Tiger Golden Elixir, shaped like a pellet and colored like a red tangerine, corresponding to the *jin* measure of heaven and earth. Each *liang* contains twenty-four *zhu*, aligning with the 384 lines of the celestial cycle.\n\nThose who cultivate must first stabilize and nourish spirit and qi. Spirit and qi are the true *wu* and *ji* earth. *Wu* and *ji* are the matchmakers, the Yellow Dame. *Wu* earth is the qi within *Kan*; *ji* earth is the spirit within *Li*. When spirit and qi are not scattered, lead and mercury naturally pair, and the crow and hare do not part, refining into a single pellet of Dragon-Tiger Golden Elixir.\n\nMaster Zhongli says: *\"Lead and mercury are the foundation of the elixir. Without *wu* and *ji*, the elixir cannot form. The three families unite as the true seed, and only then does the Golden Elixir reveal its return.\"* Those who mistakenly take the spleen as *wu* and *ji*, the Yellow Dame, or the matchmaker, refer to false *wu* and *ji*.\n\nThose who cultivate must first recognize that the fire for refining the elixir has three grades, divided into inner and outer fires. Outer fire has form and image; it can refine the five metals, transform the five grains, and nourish all beings—this fire cannot refine the elixir. The fire for refining the elixir lies within. Inner fire has no form or image; when kindled, it has flame. It relies on the qi of the five grains to generate true fire. Essence is the fire of the people; qi is the fire of the ministers; the heart is the fire of the sovereign. Sovereign fire is spirit fire; spirit fire is *xing* fire. Only *xing* fire must not be kindled or used. If *xing* fire is kindled, it is like fire born from wood, burning the body itself. This fire must not be used or stirred. If stirred, it is the stirring of spirit; if spirit stirs, qi stirs; if qi stirs, essence stirs. When *xing* fire is unstirred, spirit is settled; when spirit is settled, qi is settled; when qi is settled, essence is settled. Once the three fires are settled, they converge in the lower elixir field, gathering to heat the golden crucible and forge the jade furnace, steaming the gates and orifices. This causes the yin in the body to dissipate and the yang to grow, the true yang qi circulating in inversion above and below, naturally refining into a single pellet of radiant, crimson Dragon-Tiger Golden Elixir.\n\n*xing* and *ming* are like jade hidden in stone. Only when encountered by a skilled craftsman’s chisel can they be separated and revealed, allowing work to begin without harming the person’s *xing* and *ming*. To begin this work, one must first follow the method of emerging yin spirit, achieving minor attainment as the initial step from small to great.",

      "translated_text": "Heaven and Earth possess their natural qi, and qi has its natural numerical order. Humans receive the qi of Heaven and Earth to be born, their qi and numerical order equal to those of Heaven and Earth. Those who cultivate the Dao delve into the root of creation and transformation, knowing the pathways of yin and yang’s ascent and descent. They can settle the mind and stabilize the intent within the lower elixir field, so that not a single thought arises, and they abide in serene desirelessness.\n\nFrom midnight, the hour of *zi*, when the first yang is born, the primordial yang golden essence in the lower elixir field naturally transforms into qi of five colors, moving like raging fire, resembling a scorching wind. It pierces through the *Weilü* acupoint, strikes through the three barriers, and ascends straight to the *Niwan* Palace at the crown. Descending again to the lower elixir field, it returns once more through the *Weilü* acupoint. The harmonious qi surges forth, ambrosia pours over the crown, the Yellow River flows backward, and the four substances—spirit, qi, essence, and blood—merge into one qi, circulating in inversion above and below, endlessly revolving. This naturally aligns with the fire phases of the celestial cycle, forging a single pellet of radiant, crimson Dragon-Tiger Golden Elixir.\n\nOnce the Golden Elixir is formed, the yang spirit manifests. This yang spirit is the sacred embryo. To speak of the sacred embryo is to speak of the Golden Elixir; the Golden Elixir is the sacred embryo. The sacred embryo’s process of formation differs not from that of the ordinary embryo. The ordinary embryo is merely the creation of a person through the union of the parents’ lead and mercury. Lead is the father’s essence, mercury the mother’s blood; their union creates a person. Comparing the ordinary to the sacred reveals the inner through the outer.\n\nThe sacred embryo depends entirely on the extraction of lead and the addition of mercury. Thus, to extract lead is for the true qi of the lower elixir field to ascend directly into the upper elixir field—also called the turning of the river chariot, or the flight of golden essence behind the elbow—upward to replenish the brain, known as extracting lead to add mercury. The golden essence flies from behind the elbow to replenish the brain; when replenished to sufficiency, it flows like liquid gold, descending from the crown. Its taste is sweet, its fragrance fragrant. Swallowed, it passes through the twelve-storied tower of the throat, striking the lungs. The lungs belong to the west, to *geng* and *xin* metal, their color white. Water returns as saliva; the lungs have two qi channels through which qi flows into the heart. The heart belongs to the south, to *bing* and *ding* fire, its color red. Saliva returns as blood, and blood is mercury—this is called adding mercury with lead, or lead giving birth to mercury.\n\nThe heart has two qi channels that pour into the kidneys. The kidneys belong to the north, to *ren* and *gui* water, their color black. Blood returns as essence, and essence is lead—this is called mercury giving birth to lead. Those who cultivate and study must practice day and night without interruption, extracting lead and adding mercury. After ten months, the sacred embryo is decisively perfected. As the Perfected Zhang Pingshu said in his poem: *\"The infant is a vessel of true qi; after ten months, the embryo is complete, entering the foundation of the sacred.\"* Another half-verse from *The Moon Over the West River* reads: *\"Wood’s nature loves metal’s righteousness; metal’s affection cherishes wood’s benevolence. Swallowing and devouring each other, they become intimate—only then does one realize a man may conceive.\"*\n\nIf the Five Phases are not inverted, dragon and tiger do not unite; if the three fields do not return and reverse, the sacred embryo will not be perfected. After one hundred days of extracting lead and adding mercury, the medicinal power is complete. After two hundred days, the sacred embryo is firm. After three hundred days, the sacred embryo is fully formed, with limbs, five viscera, sinews, and bones all complete. Suddenly, there is movement—below the navel, in the elixir field, it stirs like the movement of a woman with child. Nurturing the embryo for ten months, it emerges like a golden cicada shedding its shell, a body outside the body. The yang spirit appears, its infant form fresh and pure, its spirit luminous, its body like empty space—gathering, it takes shape; scattering, it is boundless.\n\nNext, one must learn to guide the spirit out of the shell. The spirit steps out a few paces, turns to observe the old body, and sees nothing—if seen, it appears like a dung heap, repulsive in myriad ways. The spirit roams far in an instant; at first, do not go too far. Initially, one step, two steps; later, two *li*, three *li*. With accumulated days, entering and exiting become effortless, a thousand *li* or ten thousand *li* like extending an arm—this is called the emergence of the yang spirit. This is the method of perfecting the celestial immortal, the art of attaining eternal life.\n\n**Diagram of the Golden Cicada Shedding Its Shell for the Celestial Immortal**\n**Oral Instructions:**\nThose who cultivate eternal life and forge the Dragon-Tiger Golden Elixir must first know the pathways of yin and yang’s ascent and descent before they can begin. Extracting lead and adding mercury, soaring with the sun and moon, reversing and restoring the true qi of yin and yang, circulating in inversion above and below, endlessly revolving—naturally, a pellet of Dragon-Tiger Golden Elixir is forged.\n\nThe human spine has twenty-four vertebrae. Counting from the bottom, the first vertebra below is called the *Weilü* acupoint, also known as the Dragon-Tiger acupoint, the Caoxi Path, the Ninefold Iron Drum, the Three-Pronged Bone, the River Chariot Bone, the River Chariot Path, the Qi Sea Gate, the Heavenward Ridge, or the Ladder to Heaven. The *Weilü* acupoint resembles a golden crucible, with nine apertures inside and out, all interconnected. Along the spine’s center and on either side, there are three pathways. One surges straight up to the *Niwan* Palace at the crown; from the *Niwan* Palace, it descends back to the lower elixir field, then returns through the *Weilü* acupoint—this is the ascending pathway from behind. The *Niwan* Palace is the descending pathway from the front. The *Niwan* Palace and *Weilü* acupoint are the pathways of yin and yang’s ascent and descent.\n\nThe human spine has three barriers: the *Weilü* acupoint is called the lower barrier, comprising three vertebrae. Counting from the third vertebra of the lower barrier to the eighteenth vertebra is the middle barrier. From the eighteenth vertebra of the middle barrier to the *Yuzhen* barrier and the three vertebrae of the great vertebra up to the *Niwan* Palace is the upper barrier.",
