Now, there is a man/woman of such-and-such a name, of cinnabar essence and pure disposition, whose heart yearns for the clarity of the Perfected. Having submitted a petition and sworn an oath, they seek to receive the Primordial Register of the Supreme Grotto-Heaven Vajra Three-Five.\n\nAccordingly, in accordance with the statutes, the titles of Heavenly Vajra Generals, soldiers, celestial officials, and marshals are conferred—all in strict adherence to the Non-Ultimate Great Dao, the Primordial Most High, the Supreme Jade Emperor, the Unsurpassed Perfected, the Great Sage of the Ten Directions, the Most High Dao Lord, the Three Heavens’ Most High Lord Lao, the Nine Heavens’ Most High Elder, the Unsurpassed Mysterious Supreme Jade Morning Lord, and the Golden Portal Jade Emperor.\n\nToday, the Primordial Register is transmitted, and the generals, soldiers, celestial officials, and marshals of the Supreme Grotto-Heaven Vajra Three-Five Nine Heavens Primordial Perfected are assigned, each according to their rank and position, to guard and stabilize the Three Origins—upper, middle, and lower—within the body of the recipient.

None shall dare to disobey. *Hasten as the Law of the Supreme Most High Jade Emperor commands!*\n\n---\n\n**Heavenly Hosts of the Grotto-Heavens’ Vajra Cavalry:**\n- *Grotto-Heaven Mysterious Vajra

The High Merit Chariot-Rider Ge Haoling, styled Wenshi, stands thirty million *zhang* tall, supervising the military affairs of the Nine Heavens’ armies, soldiers, and marshals, commanding formations of *yi* and *wan* of *yi* and *wan* chariots, arraying celestial plumes and boundless hosts, encircling the ten directions, encamping heaven and regulating earth, soaring through the Nine Principles. His awe-inspiring might shakes the cosmos, sweeping away the Six Heavens, warding off calamity and preserving the kalpa, dispelling disaster and extinguishing misfortune. He traverses heaven and earth, wielding the celestial pivot, discerning the patterns of fate, sustaining the Three Origins, stabilizing the Five Phases, governing the Three Realms. Now, having received the *True Form Mysterious Talisman*, the ritual is established within the person. At the Left Palace of Azure Radiance and Jade Towers, the Celestial Pivot’s Nine Passes, he eternally governs the movements of the Nine Heavens’ living spirits. From the depths of the Mysterious Radiance, his light merges with sun and moon to form a single brilliance, flowing luminosity flashing like lightning, illuminating and transforming one’s form. The Vajra-riding great officials, soldiers, marshals, and officers all guard and encircle one’s body in a hundred million myriad layers. When manifest, his divine efficacy fills heaven and covers earth; when concealed, he rests in profound stillness, fixing his radiance within one’s body. From the Highest Nine Heavens downward, none dare fail to submit. Wherever one goes, he follows—traversing blades and fording waters, the Three Calamities and Nine Perils dare not oppose. The divine officials of the Three Realms escort and attend, ascending with one to the Imperial Court of the Golden Towers and Jade Emperor’s Celestial Throne. With Vajra strides, he eliminates celestial disasters, annihilates legions of malevolence, beheads evil spirits, dragons and tigers frolic, subjugating the unruly. The Vermilion Bird soars in grace, the Nine Demons crumble, the Dark Warrior patrols the void, and demonic essences are exposed. The General upholds the celestial patterns and assists the nation’s fortunes, governing calamities. The Nine Origins and Three Luminaries, the Seven Luminaries and Celestial Pivot, the Jade Balance of the Five Directions, and the arrayed stars of the Northern Dipper—one’s form, as the *Highest Supreme Primordial Supreme-One*, the Left Auxiliary Three-Five, governs the Fourteen Lunar Lodges of the Eastern and Southern Quarters, the Yang Dipper, Yang Spirits, and Yang Qi, penetrating heaven and earth. He stabilizes the *Highest Supreme-One Life-Spirit Division* of ninety-nine myriad beings, governing the Liver Mansion’s *Primordial Upper Mysterious Elder Life-Spirit Division* of eighty-eight myriad beings, and the Heart Mansion’s peace, securing the Grotto-Heaven’s Left Palace in the two directions, overshadowing the Primordial Heaven. *Hasten! As the Primordial Supreme-One’s Ordinance commands.*\n\n**Golden Armor, Vermilion Robes, Green Sash**\n\nThe *Highest Supreme Primordial Supreme-One Grotto-Heaven Flying Primordial Void Primordial Upper Capital Right Assistant Upper Primordial Nine Heavens Primordial Vajra Three-Five Vast Might Transcendent Heaven Great General Who Governs the Eight Directions*. The High Dawn Chariot-Rider Tang Wenchang, styled Jin Xuan, stands thirty million *zhang* tall, commanding the Three Armies’ soldiers, marshals, and officers in divine martial affairs. Leading formations of *yi* and *wan* of *yi* and *wan* chariots, his hosts soar through the void, arraying celestial clouds in boundless ranks, encircling the eight poles, inspecting heaven and regulating earth, governing the Three Principles. Soaring in flight, he shakes the cosmos, his wind-chariots traversing the heavens, his radiance blazing across the ten thousand directions. He captures demons and summons spirits, punishing malevolence and executing demons, severing inauspicious omens. Sustaining the Three Heavens’ destiny, now having received the *True Form Mysterious Talisman*, the ritual is established within the person’s Right Palace of the Plain Heaven’s Seven Treasures and Golden Towers’ summit, eternally governing the movements of the Three Heavens’ life-spirits. Constantly illuminating the palace of sun and moon, his light descends to shine upon one’s form, encamping and guarding with celestial myriads in myriad layers. When manifest, his brilliance fills heaven and covers earth; when concealed, he rests in profound stillness, fixing his radiance within one’s body. From the Supreme Three Heavens downward, none dare fail to submit. Wherever one roams—mountains, rivers, the four seas, the eight poles, the nine provinces—all divine spirits, ghost kings, earth gods, talismanic shrines, and village deities, the true officials who infuse *qi*, all must receive the talisman and obey the command.\n\nThe *Highest Supreme Primordial Supreme-One Grotto-Heaven Flying Brahmā-King Void Capital Central Stabilizer Upper Primordial Nine Heavens Primordial Vajra Three-Five Pacifier of Heaven Upright Might Vast Transcendent Great General*. The Supervisor of the Ten Directions’ High Chariots, Martial Spirit Commander of the Armies Zhou Wendu, styled Jin Guang, stands three thousand *zhang* tall, commanding the Ten Directions’ Flying Heavenly armies, marshals, soldiers, and officers in divine martial and punitive affairs. Leading formations of *yi* of *yi* and *wan* of *wan* chariots, his hosts soar through heaven, arraying celestial plumes in boundless ranks, securing the Nine Origins, encamping heaven and wielding awe, shaking the cloud formations. He drives away the Six Heavens, inspects and subjugates the Northern Feng, governs the myriad spirits, wields the celestial soldiers’ halberds, and commands the Three Realms. He subjugates demonic grasses and hundredfold spirits, establishes the Ghost Emperor’s standards, severs and annihilates treachery and malevolence. Hearing deceit, he punishes; hearing demonic forces, he executes; hearing evil, he slays; hearing goodness, he protects; hearing rectitude, he elevates; hearing truth, he defends; hearing fortune, he guards; hearing misfortune, he dispels; hearing auspice, he preserves; hearing inauspice, he eliminates. Thus, he sustains the destiny of heaven and earth. Now, having received the *True Form Mysterious Talisman*, the ritual is established within the person’s Three Origins, the *Great Tenuity Jade Mansion*’s Central August Palace, the Golden Towers’ Five Citadels, and the Nine Dawns’ Hall, eternally governing the movements of heaven and earth’s life-spirits, rectifying the Celestial Pivot. The sun to the left, the moon to the right, their flying radiance illuminates the void. Fire-armored soldiers form the vanguard, venomous weapons follow behind. To the left, martial warriors array in myriad layers of Azure Dragons; to the right, divine marshals stand as White Tigers of Heavenly Assault. The Vermilion Bird, spirit fowl, spits fire and howls wind. The Curved Array and Dark Warrior devour ghosts and malevolence. To the left, the *Transcendent Heaven Force-Soldiers* behead and capture treacherous demons; to the right, the *Vajra Force-Soldiers* swallow evil and consume ghosts. Flowing luminosity and blazing lightning—should any inauspicious force dare appear, when manifest, his awe-inspiring might sweeps away filth and dust, encamping heaven and regulating earth, filling the great void. When concealed, he rests in the profound stillness of the infinitesimal, establishing heaven and earth through divine efficacy. Now, he stabilizes one’s Three Origins. From heaven above and heaven below, earth above and earth below, none dare fail to submit. Wherever one travels—mountains, broad wilderness, rivers, four seas, eight poles, nine provinces—all divine spirits, ghost kings, earth gods, talismanic shrines, village deities, and true officials who infuse *qi* must receive the talisman and obey the command. *Hasten!

Now, there is a man/woman of such-and-such a name, of cinnabar essence and pure disposition, whose heart yearns for the clarity of the Perfected. Having submitted a petition and sworn an oath, they seek to receive the Primordial Register of the Supreme Grotto-Heaven Vajra Three-Five.\n\nAccordingly, in accordance with the statutes, the titles of Heavenly Vajra Generals, soldiers, celestial officials, and marshals are conferred—all in strict adherence to the Non-Ultimate Great Dao, the Primordial Most High, the Supreme Jade Emperor, the Unsurpassed Perfected, the Great Sage of the Ten Directions, the Most High Dao Lord, the Three Heavens’ Most High Lord Lao, the Nine Heavens’ Most High Elder, the Unsurpassed Mysterious Supreme Jade Morning Lord, and the Golden Portal Jade Emperor.\n\nToday, the Primordial Register is transmitted, and the generals, soldiers, celestial officials, and marshals of the Supreme Grotto-Heaven Vajra Three-Five Nine Heavens Primordial Perfected are assigned, each according to their rank and position, to guard and stabilize the Three Origins—upper, middle, and lower—within the body of the recipient. They shall array the Golden Hall, Jade Palace, Five Cities, and celestial, feathered, chamber, divine, and phoenix regalia to encamp within the recipient’s form.\n\nTurning left, Nine Hundred Million Myriad Layers shall guard the body; turning right, Nine Hundred Million Myriad Layers shall accompany all ingress and egress, journeying and roaming. The Heavenly Vajra shall govern the Ten Directions, summoning and commanding the celestial and terrestrial deities of the Eight Poles, the myriad spirits, the Five Marchmounts, famous mountains and great marshes, the Three Rivers and Four Seas, the Jiang, He, Huai, and Ji, the Four Watercourses, Nine Regions, village shrines, Nine Provinces’ talismanic temples, hamlet altars, and the void expanses—boundless, fathomless, without darkness or obscurity, without above or below, the clear void of the abyssal grottoes, and the watery palaces’ divine hosts—all shall heed the talismanic command and celestial governance.\n\nShould the body be concealed or the form hidden, if malevolent spirits, evil ghosts, or cloud-roving hunters of the Six Heavens, along with spectral essences, demons, and *wangliang* seek to harm the recipient, the Heavenly Vajra shall unite in power, shaking heaven and earth, their awe-inspiring might sweeping all away. None shall dare to disobey. *Hasten as the Law of the Supreme Most High Jade Emperor commands!*\n\n---\n\n**Heavenly Hosts of the Grotto-Heavens’ Vajra Cavalry:**\n- *Grotto-Heaven Mysterious Vajra

The High Merit Chariot-Rider Ge Haoling, styled Wenshi, stands thirty million *zhang* tall, supervising the military affairs of the Nine Heavens’ armies, soldiers, and marshals, commanding formations of *yi* and *wan* of *yi* and *wan* chariots, arraying celestial plumes and boundless hosts, encircling the ten directions, encamping heaven and regulating earth, soaring through the Nine Principles. His awe-inspiring might shakes the cosmos, sweeping away the Six Heavens, warding off calamity and preserving the kalpa, dispelling disaster and extinguishing misfortune. He traverses heaven and earth, wielding the celestial pivot, discerning the patterns of fate, sustaining the Three Origins, stabilizing the Five Phases, governing the Three Realms. Now, having received the *True Form Mysterious Talisman*, the ritual is established within the person. At the Left Palace of Azure Radiance and Jade Towers, the Celestial Pivot’s Nine Passes, he eternally governs the movements of the Nine Heavens’ living spirits. From the depths of the Mysterious Radiance, his light merges with sun and moon to form a single brilliance, flowing luminosity flashing like lightning, illuminating and transforming one’s form. The Vajra-riding great officials, soldiers, marshals, and officers all guard and encircle one’s body in a hundred million myriad layers. When manifest, his divine efficacy fills heaven and covers earth; when concealed, he rests in profound stillness, fixing his radiance within one’s body. From the Highest Nine Heavens downward, none dare fail to submit. Wherever one goes, he follows—traversing blades and fording waters, the Three Calamities and Nine Perils dare not oppose. The divine officials of the Three Realms escort and attend, ascending with one to the Imperial Court of the Golden Towers and Jade Emperor’s Celestial Throne. With Vajra strides, he eliminates celestial disasters, annihilates legions of malevolence, beheads evil spirits, dragons and tigers frolic, subjugating the unruly. The Vermilion Bird soars in grace, the Nine Demons crumble, the Dark Warrior patrols the void, and demonic essences are exposed. The General upholds the celestial patterns and assists the nation’s fortunes, governing calamities. The Nine Origins and Three Luminaries, the Seven Luminaries and Celestial Pivot, the Jade Balance of the Five Directions, and the arrayed stars of the Northern Dipper—one’s form, as the *Highest Supreme Primordial Supreme-One*, the Left Auxiliary Three-Five, governs the Fourteen Lunar Lodges of the Eastern and Southern Quarters, the Yang Dipper, Yang Spirits, and Yang Qi, penetrating heaven and earth. He stabilizes the *Highest Supreme-One Life-Spirit Division* of ninety-nine myriad beings, governing the Liver Mansion’s *Primordial Upper Mysterious Elder Life-Spirit Division* of eighty-eight myriad beings, and the Heart Mansion’s peace, securing the Grotto-Heaven’s Left Palace in the two directions, overshadowing the Primordial Heaven. *Hasten!

The High Dawn Chariot-Rider Tang Wenchang, styled Jin Xuan, stands thirty million *zhang* tall, commanding the Three Armies’ soldiers, marshals, and officers in divine martial affairs. Leading formations of *yi* and *wan* of *yi* and *wan* chariots, his hosts soar through the void, arraying celestial clouds in boundless ranks, encircling the eight poles, inspecting heaven and regulating earth, governing the Three Principles. Soaring in flight, he shakes the cosmos, his wind-chariots traversing the heavens, his radiance blazing across the ten thousand directions. He captures demons and summons spirits, punishing malevolence and executing demons, severing inauspicious omens. Sustaining the Three Heavens’ destiny, now having received the *True Form Mysterious Talisman*, the ritual is established within the person’s Right Palace of the Plain Heaven’s Seven Treasures and Golden Towers’ summit, eternally governing the movements of the Three Heavens’ life-spirits. Constantly illuminating the palace of sun and moon, his light descends to shine upon one’s form, encamping and guarding with celestial myriads in myriad layers. When manifest, his brilliance fills heaven and covers earth; when concealed, he rests in profound stillness, fixing his radiance within one’s body. From the Supreme Three Heavens downward, none dare fail to submit. Wherever one roams—mountains, rivers, the four seas, the eight poles, the nine provinces—all divine spirits, ghost kings, earth gods, talismanic shrines, and village deities, the true officials who infuse *qi*, all must receive the talisman and obey the command.\n\nThe *Highest Supreme Primordial Supreme-One Grotto-Heaven Flying Brahmā-King Void Capital Central Stabilizer Upper Primordial Nine Heavens Primordial Vajra Three-Five Pacifier of Heaven Upright Might Vast Transcendent Great General*. The Supervisor of the Ten Directions’ High Chariots, Martial Spirit Commander of the Armies Zhou Wendu, styled Jin Guang, stands three thousand *zhang* tall, commanding the Ten Directions’ Flying Heavenly armies, marshals, soldiers, and officers in divine martial and punitive affairs. Leading formations of *yi* of *yi* and *wan* of *wan* chariots, his hosts soar through heaven, arraying celestial plumes in boundless ranks, securing the Nine Origins, encamping heaven and wielding awe, shaking the cloud formations. He drives away the Six Heavens, inspects and subjugates the Northern Feng, governs the myriad spirits, wields the celestial soldiers’ halberds, and commands the Three Realms. He subjugates demonic grasses and hundredfold spirits, establishes the Ghost Emperor’s standards, severs and annihilates treachery and malevolence. Hearing deceit, he punishes; hearing demonic forces, he executes; hearing evil, he slays; hearing goodness, he protects; hearing rectitude, he elevates; hearing truth, he defends; hearing fortune, he guards; hearing misfortune, he dispels; hearing auspice, he preserves; hearing inauspice, he eliminates. Thus, he sustains the destiny of heaven and earth. Now, having received the *True Form Mysterious Talisman*, the ritual is established within the person’s Three Origins, the *Great Tenuity Jade Mansion*’s Central August Palace, the Golden Towers’ Five Citadels, and the Nine Dawns’ Hall, eternally governing the movements of heaven and earth’s life-spirits, rectifying the Celestial Pivot. The sun to the left, the moon to the right, their flying radiance illuminates the void. Fire-armored soldiers form the vanguard, venomous weapons follow behind. To the left, martial warriors array in myriad layers of Azure Dragons; to the right, divine marshals stand as White Tigers of Heavenly Assault. The Vermilion Bird, spirit fowl, spits fire and howls wind. The Curved Array and Dark Warrior devour ghosts and malevolence. To the left, the *Transcendent Heaven Force-Soldiers* behead and capture treacherous demons; to the right, the *Vajra Force-Soldiers* swallow evil and consume ghosts. Flowing luminosity and blazing lightning—should any inauspicious force dare appear, when manifest, his awe-inspiring might sweeps away filth and dust, encamping heaven and regulating earth, filling the great void. When concealed, he rests in the profound stillness of the infinitesimal, establishing heaven and earth through divine efficacy. Now, he stabilizes one’s Three Origins. From heaven above and heaven below, earth above and earth below, none dare fail to submit. Wherever one travels—mountains, broad wilderness, rivers, four seas, eight poles, nine provinces—all divine spirits, ghost kings, earth gods, talismanic shrines, village deities, and true officials who infuse *qi* must receive the talisman and obey the command. *Hasten!

Humbly presented.\n\n**Items for receiving the Three-Five talismanic regalia and tokens of faith:**\n- A pair of golden buttons,\n- Thirty-five feet of crimson silk,\n- Seven ounces of cinnabar,\n- Ten catties of *mu xiang* (wood fragrance).\n\nThe Pure Primordial Ultimate Orthodox One’s Mysterious Qi, as transmitted by Celestial Master So-and-so in accordance with the Dao, your servant bows twice with reverence.\n\nO Highest True and Majestic Qi, in strict adherence to the Mysterious Statutes, the males and females born as So-and-so, having first received the grace of their master’s enlightenment and been appointed to celestial offices, bear an undeserved bounty—truly an immeasurable outpouring of compassion. Yet your servants were born in this defiled age, their lives beset by the Three Calamities, their forms tainted by the Ten Evils, their habits ingrained by nature. They have transgressed the sacred prohibitions, their sins filling the empty void, and now suffer the consequences in succession, with no merit to atone. Were it not for the mercy of Heaven, how could they be delivered?\n\nWe have heard that the Great Dao’s compassion is universally vast, its grace extending to the Ten Directions, opening the bridge of deliverance for all living beings, its methods all-encompassing. Its blessings moisten the Three Realms, its grace permeates the Six Paths. Your servants now submit this petition with utmost sincerity, pledging their lives to the Mysterious True Ones. We beseech the Three Honored Ones to appear and bestow upon us the Upper Primordial Grotto-Heaven’s Three-Five Vajra Mysterious Register, the Three Generals’ true-form talismans, the tally tablets, staffs, and contracts, to forever relieve us of the sufferings of the long river.

May they summon the celestial officials, distinguish their proper ranks, and on such-and-such day of this month, confer upon us the teachings as prescribed. We shall present this memorial and petition before the Primordial Ultimate Great Dao.\n\nYour servant, trembling with awe, prostrates himself again and again, acknowledging his mortal offenses. Humbly submitted to the Supreme Primordial Nine Heavens’ Golden Portal Jade Thearch, to examine and summon the Pure and True Qi.\n\nIn the year of such-and-such, on such-and-such day of such-and-such month, at the hour of *zi*, your servant So-and-so, in such-and-such prefecture, county, township, and village, submits this memorial to the Supreme Primordial Nine Heavens’ Supreme True and Radiant Great Assembly of Perfected Ones.\n\n**Ritual for the Three-Five Chapter Regalia:**\nThe Pure Primordial Ultimate Orthodox One’s Mysterious Qi, as transmitted by Celestial Master So-and-so in accordance with the Dao, your servant bows twice with reverence.\n\nO Highest True and Majestic Qi, in strict adherence to the Mysterious Statutes, the males and females So-and-so, numbering so-and-so, have submitted their petition and prostrated themselves, seeking to receive the Upper Primordial Grotto-Heaven’s Three-Five Vajra Mysterious Register, the Three Generals’ true-form talismans, the tally tablets, staffs, and contracts. On such-and-such day of this month, your servant has, in accordance with the statutes, appointed them to their celestial offices, as recorded in the preceding memorial.\n\nWe prostrate ourselves and pray: May the Boundless Great Dao, Most True and Great Sage, Supreme Heavenly Worthy, deign to gaze upon us with divine insight. May the Compassionate True Ones descend and open the path of deliverance for us, that these teachings may become our eternal treasure. May the decree be issued to the Nine Heavens’ Supreme Jade Thearch, the Overseers of True Deliverance, the Jade Gentlemen of the Mysterious Capital’s Immortal Offices, the Feathered Gentlemen of the Ten Directions’ Flying Heavenly Deliverance Jade Bureaus, the Three-Five Deliverance Envoys, and the Disaster-Dispelling, Dao-Conferring True Lords of the Supreme Three Heavens’ Golden Portal Jade Thearch. May they all descend together, their celestial mounts filling heaven and earth, their flowing essence swift as lightning, their radiance resplendent and serene. May they sweep away the myriad wrongs of the Six Heavens, summon the divine officials of the Three Realms, and together descend to oversee the deliverance of your servants’ ritual affairs. May the statutes and ordinances be conferred, forever anchoring within us, never to grow cold.\n\nYour servant prostrates himself and presents this written memorial. We implore the Boundless Great Dao, Supreme Golden Portal Jade Thearch, Most True and Great Sage, to take pity on your servant’s petition and, in accordance with the matter at hand, distinguish the Pure and True Mysterious Qi, the wondrous efficacy of the living spirits. May the celestial officials and their retinues confer these teachings upon us, ever guarding and protecting, their flowing light swift as lightning, filling our palaces and chambers, and eternally safeguarding the Three Primordials.\n\nWe humbly entrust this memorial to the Directing Perfected Talisman Clerks, the Flying Dragon Riders, the Flying Heavenly Jade Gentlemen, the Flying Perfected White Tiger Spirit Dragon Riders, and their twelve hundred attendants each, to swiftly transmit this document and present it before the Supreme Most True Jade Thearch.\n\nYour servant, trembling with awe, prostrates himself again and again, acknowledging his mortal offenses.
