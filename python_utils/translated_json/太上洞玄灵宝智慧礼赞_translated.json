  "full_translation": "**The Supreme Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure Wisdom Adorations**\n\n*Scripture Title:* The Supreme Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure Wisdom Adorations.\n*Author:* Unknown.\nContains eight wisdom adorations with appended rituals. One scroll.\n*Source Text:* *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, Cavernous Mystery Section, Hymns and Eulogies.\n\n---\n\n**The Supreme Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure Wisdom Adorations**\n\nThe Supreme’s mysterious void is the ancestral teaching,\nIts scriptures revered for vasting the Dao.\nBowing and rising, one attains immortality,\nPassing kalpas without reckoning of years.\nMajestic is the Great Perfected’s virtue,\nSilent and still, rooted in non-arising.\nCelestial radiance weaves empty structures,\nRiding the void, naturally journeying.\nSun and moon blaze with brilliance,\nPeace and harmony bring boundless joy.\nThose who study immortality sever ornate thoughts,\nEach thought accumulates through mutual causation.\nComing and going disturb my spirit,\nRestlessness prevents all attainment.\nExtinguish thoughts, dwell in tranquil leisure,\nEffortlessly enter emptiness and stillness.\nSeek the scriptures as if parched with thirst,\nHold resolve firm as metal and stone.\nPreserve the child, ascend the mysterious path,\nThe Five Numinous Ones transmit talismanic registers.\nCross me through the Six Perfections,\nThus able to unbind the Three Netherworlds.\nPurify fasts, venerate the Primal Simplicity,\nExhale and inhale to nurture cloud-teeth.\nRoam within the Golden Gates,\nJade Capital is my home.\nNaturally, the Seven Treasures arise,\nEach person seated upon a lotus.\nGazing upward, chew the forbidden fruit of the Mysterious Capital,\nBowing down, drink deeply of the hollow melon of the Void.\nComplexion shines like a thousand suns,\nWhy reckon the multitude of kalpas?\nDharma drums summon celestial immortals,\nResonant bells subdue great demons.\nDivine winds waft fragrant blossoms,\nResplendent, unfurling ornate robes.\nThe Great Perfected strums the cloud zither,\nThe assembled immortals pluck numinous lutes.\nElegant songs resound in the Three Heavens,\nScattering wisdom through the Jade Flower Grove.\nThe seven ancestors ascend the Hall of Blessings,\nThereby treading the mysterious tones.\nIf past-life virtue was insufficient,\nThis scripture remains distant and hard to find.\nSincerity in the Dao knows no end,\nYet plotting flight only leads to sinking.\nThe Supreme’s non-active Dao,\nExpands within the hearts of all beings.\nStudying the Dao arises from cinnabar faith,\nRevering the master as one’s closest kin.\nDrawing in radiance, pairing with purity and emptiness,\nDiligently renewing with each passing day.\nUntil all beings are delivered,\nI shall not deliver myself.\nGreat vows bear weighty recompense,\nMysterious virtue must naturally unfold.\nYin evil sins run deep,\nConfronting one like a turning wheel.\nStudying the Dao is also arduous,\nDay and night, cultivate the field of blessings.\nPlanting virtue is like planting a tree,\nPiling baskets of earth to form a mountain.\nIf you can delight in the mysterious and exalted,\nYou shall soar to the azure heavens.\nCultivate this non-active Dao,\nAnd be bound in affinity with goodness.\n\nThe Supreme’s most recondite scripture,\nIs called the *Wisdom Chapters*.\nLiberation from suffering comes through great talent,\nTranscending the mundane to attain the Real.\nNuminous countenance, rare in the world,\nGlowing like a lotus in the abyss.\nEach person’s conduct has its root,\nAll stemming from past-life merit.\nEstablish virtue while time permits,\nMake vows—none shall go unanswered.\nGood and evil both await their retribution,\nThe principle of rise and fall is unfathomable.\nThe worthy uphold the Dharma’s words,\nVirtue and power lie in forgetting both.\nUnderstanding this is great wisdom,\nAscending to become a Lord of the Great Ultimate.\nJeweled canopies rise in succession,\nCommanding chariots drawn by nine dragons.\nGolden blossoms hold the Cavernous Scriptures,\nImmortal youths bear incense.\nWhistling songs resound through the Mysterious Capital,\nJade chimes strike the jasper bells.\nRising to ascend the Great Clarity,\nSurpassing radiance to roam the Purple Empyrean,\nPreserving the origin, upholding the Dharma’s net,\nWandering the mysterious ultimate in freedom.\nTen thousand kalpas are like last night,\nA thousand *chun* like this morning.\nTowering, shading the cloud blossoms,\nHand grasping the branches of the Jeweled Grove.\nFragrant smoke naturally arises,\nMysterious steps ascend on whirlwinds.\nDivine banners disperse with the wind,\nComplex thoughts dissolve in due time.\nExtinguish wisdom, vast the great chaos,\nObserve the pure hymn of non-action.\n\n---\n\n**Eulogy of the Earth Talisman**\n\nResplendent, it unveils the hidden epoch,\nObscuring the radiance of sun and moon.\nMysterious yin does not dissolve the night,\nThe four assemblies all reverently attend.\nNuminous destiny naturally accords with the plan,\nSuddenly illuminating the vast sky.\nThe scripture’s eightfold script forms characters,\nThe five tones harmonize into verses.\nThe Perfected opens great forgiveness,\nThe heavens, vast and bright, descend.\nWondrous is the Dragon Han Dao,\nThe eightfold script coalesces into form.\nResplendent, it soars within the void,\nStreaming light through the courts of the Three Realms.\nDivine charts reveal numinous assemblies,\nJade script bears talismanic names.\nPray to the Perfected, ascend the Purple Peak,\nProclaim destiny at the Numinous Mountain.\nJade maidens raise Brahmanic echoes,\nGolden youths offer purple incense.\nScript names communicate with the Nine Palaces,\nCharacters ascend to the Three Heavens.\nEternally enjoy boundless longevity,\nInscribed to become Golden Flower Immortals.\n\n---\n\n**Invoking the Perfected**\n\nThe Nine Heavens command the numinous chapters,\nThe spirit of life transcends itself.\nThe Primordial Lord halts the path of death,\nThe Marshal recites the Cavernous Hymns.\nOne chant, and the myriad Perfected know,\nNine recitations, and the heavens all attend.\nBowing heads, revering the kalpic years,\nCelebrating the purple glory of the ancient sprouts.\nThe Great Void stirs numinous assemblies,\nCommanding me to compose the *Life-Spirit Chapters*.\nOne chant stirs the Nine Mysteries,\nA second recitation unites heaven and earth.\nHarmonizing naturally with one another,\nNine recitations perfect human merit.\nThe Great Sage praises primordial auspiciousness,\nScattering blossoms to venerate the Great Void.\nPray to the Perfected—they shall surely respond,\nRequest blessings—blessings shall be vast.\nThe heavens all rejoice,\nAll bow heads in reverence.\nResonant are the Nine Heavens’ tones,\nJade chapters give rise to myriad spirits.\nThree recitations array the correct positions,\n*Qi* intermingles at the gates of the eight celestial bodies.\nThe Mysterious Pass halts the gate of death,\nThe Numinous Seal guards the source of fluids.\nResponsive assemblies naturally stir the numinous,\nNumerical clarity reveals the Dao’s hidden return.\nThe wheel of blessings sheds the infant’s husk,\nBowing heads to praise the Cavernous Scriptures.\n\n---\n\n**Thanksgiving to the Spirits**\n\nToday, we pray for luminous blessings,\nBowing heads to the numinous altar.\nThe assembled immortals all descend,\nThe host of sages all come to observe.\nHaving bestowed abundant grace,\nThey linger, cranes circling in flight.\nMay the fast’s host enjoy long life,\nThe entire household find peace and security.\nRadiant between heaven and earth,\nWandering among the assembled spirits.\nThe Milky Way scatters auspicious clouds,\nGates and courtyards teem with wind and rain.\nToday, the immortals and sages descend,\nBestowing grace in answer to prayers.\nSweet dew sprinkles upon the destitute,\nHungry ghosts are naturally gathered.\nRank and emolument accord with the nether registers,\nWealth and nobility endure for a thousand autumns.\n\nAll you boundless beings of the human and celestial realms,\nFortunate to encounter the true Dharma King.\nCompassionately descending to the ritual arena,\nSmiling, releasing majestic radiance.\nIlluminating the three-thousandfold great chiliocosm,\nDevotedly prostrating to the ten directions.\n\nWith single-minded devotion, we prostrate to the Heavenly Worthy of the Jade Treasure, Lord of the Land of Many Joys in the Eastern Realm.\nWith single-minded devotion, we prostrate to the Heavenly Worthy of Myriad Blessings, the Mysterious Perfected of the Land of the Great Blessing Hall in the Southern Realm.\n\nWith single-minded devotion, we prostrate to the Heavenly Worthy of Supreme Mystery, Lord of the Land of Great Floating Li in the Western Realm.\nWith single-minded devotion, we prostrate to the Heavenly Worthy of Jade Dawn, the Mysterious Supreme of the Land of Xi Na in the Northern Realm.\nWith single-minded devotion, we prostrate to the Heavenly Worthy of Upper Sagehood, Deliverer of Immortals in the Land of Wondrous Joy in the Northeastern Realm.\nWith single-minded devotion, we prostrate to the Heavenly Worthy of Life-Sustaining Deliverance, Lord of the Land of Difficult Victory in the Southeastern Realm.\nWith single-minded devotion, we prostrate to the Heavenly Worthy of the Great Numinous Void, the August Sovereign of the Land of Wan Li in the Southwestern Realm.\nWith single-minded devotion, we prostrate to the Heavenly Worthy of Boundless Great Splendor, Lord of the Land of Yu Dan Chan Shan in the Northwestern Realm.\nWith single-minded devotion, we prostrate to the Heavenly Worthy of Jade Clarity, the Illustrious August One of the Land of Balanced Heaven in the Upper Realm.\nWith single-minded devotion, we prostrate to the Heavenly Worthy of the Grotto Spirits, the True August One of the Land of Yu Cha in the Lower Realm.\nWith single-minded devotion, we prostrate to the Heavenly Worthies of the ten directions, as numerous as the dust-motes in the boundless void.\nWith single-minded devotion, we prostrate to the thirty-six divisions of sacred scriptures: the divine texts, numinous talismans, and precious strategies of the Three Caverns.\nWith single-minded devotion, we prostrate to the profound Dharma treasury of the cloud-seal in empty space, its eight corners trailing radiance.\nWith single-minded devotion, we prostrate to the Fragrant Forest Treasure Palace of the Jade Capital Heavenly Terrace.\nWith single-minded devotion, we prostrate to the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center, who transmits the scriptures, expounds the teachings, and ferries the deluded multitudes.\nWith single-minded devotion, we prostrate to the perfected immortals, the mysterious masters, and the host of transcendents who have attained the Dao in the ten directions.\n\nYour servant now universally invokes the grace of the Dao for the upper realms and the lower regions, the six paths of humans and celestials, emperors and lords, masters and ancestors through kalpas past, parents who gave us birth, patrons of the ten directions, and all beings of the six paths and four births. May all receive the blessings of the Dao and return to repentance.\n\nWith utmost sincerity, we repent.\nBorn in an enlightened age, we have long encountered a time of felicity and entered the Mysterious Gate. Though our bodies remain mired in delusion, our masters have bestowed upon us the sacred texts. Yet driven by karmic entanglements, we stumble at every turn. In the three assemblies and five years of ordination, we have accomplished little merit; at the eight festivals and three origins, we have often neglected rites and recitations. On the ten fast days and our birthdays, we have failed to cultivate practice; on the days of Jiazi and Gengshen, we have not paid homage to the perfected or guarded the sacred precincts. Of the nine grades of purification rites, our minds have not been single-mindedly devoted; of the three thousand deeds of merit, we have never reverently upheld them. The precepts and prohibitions are most weighty, yet our every action incurs transgression; the commandments are majestic and stern, yet our frivolous speech compounds our faults. Our hearts and minds stray, violating one hundred and eighty precepts; our wisdom and discernment deeply transgress, forsaking the three hundred great commandments. We ourselves have created the three karmic deeds, and our misfortunes accumulate like mountains; the six desires and four entanglements plunge our transgressions as deep as the vast sea. Our offenses are recorded in the black registers, our sins bound in the nether courts. We constantly fear that when judgment comes, our bodies will be carved away and our lives wither in the repositories of fate.\n\nWe humbly beseech the Most Perfect and Most Sagely to distantly behold our sincere devotion, to remove death and ascend to life, to further extend our years, to forever extinguish calamities, to bestow upon us fortune and wisdom, to grant us ample emolument and long life. May we ever dwell in the shade of the Dharma, our wisdom penetrating the mysterious, forever dispelling delusion and confusion, practicing the Dao to attain perfection, and upholding the scriptures without transgression.\n\nHaving repented, with single-minded devotion, we prostrate to the Three Treasures.\n\nWith utmost sincerity, we vow:\nMay we, through kalpas past, broadly cultivate the goodness of the three karmic deeds.\nMay we constantly uphold the wondrous Dharma to save sentient beings,\nNever enmeshed in the snares of the dusty world.\nMay we, life after life, transcend the sufferings of the three evil paths,\nAnd attain a heart as bright as the sun of wisdom,\nAble to dispel darkness and illuminate the void,\nIn all Dharmas, free from the notions of self and others.\nMay we constantly arise in the compassionate practice of the One Vehicle,\nOur mouths ever savoring the sweet dew of gathas,\nProclaiming the pure precepts to deliver humans and celestials,\nNever uttering evil speech or frivolous words.\nMay we never consume the lives of beings that breathe blood,\nOur feet never tread the three evil paths.\nMay our hands never kill a single living being,\nOur bodies like shadows, aiding the Heavenly Worthies.\nIn sitting and rising, may we traverse without shunning the distant,\nWishing that all kinds, together with us,\nMay forsake the bodies of hungry ghosts and beasts,\nAnd with the celestials and humans of the three realms,\nAll diligently seek the supreme Dao.\n\nHaving made our vows, with single-minded devotion, we prostrate to the Three Treasures.\n\nAll listen to these words:\nAt this time, recite the verse of purity,\nIf you seek to return to the true Dao,\nLeave the worldly and dwell in the cliffs and peaks,\nThrice daily burn precious incense.\nWith steadfast hearts, diligently uphold the precepts,\nYou must forsake glory and emolument,\nLet not fame and profit entangle you.\nThen you will encounter a true person,\nWho will transmit to you the supreme Dao.\n\nThose in the upper, middle, and lower seats,\nEach remember the six recollections:\nRecollect Heaven, recollect Earth,\nRecollect the Dao, recollect the scriptures,\nRecollect the perfected, recollect the precepts.\n\nAll listen to the diligent upholding of the precepts:\nFirst, do not kill;\nSecond, do not steal;\nThird, do not engage in illicit sex;\nFourth, do not lie;\nFifth, do not indulge in wine or eat meat;\nSixth, do not slander the worthy and good.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy’s bequeathed teachings clearly exhort and admonish.\nStrive diligently in cultivation,\nSeek early liberation.\nThe human body is hard to obtain,\nBirth in the Middle Kingdom is hard to attain.\nOnce the human body is lost,\nFor ten thousand kalpas it is not regained.\nTherefore, I exhort you all,\nTogether return to this ritual arena.\nIn this life and the next,\nConstantly encounter the true scriptures and precepts.\n\nHaving admonished and exhorted, with single-minded devotion, we prostrate to the Three Treasures.\n\nHere concludes *The Wondrous Wisdom Hymn of Veneration from the Numinous Treasure of the Cavern of Mystery*.",

May all receive the blessings of the Dao and return to repentance.\n\nWith utmost sincerity, we repent.\nBorn in an enlightened age, we have long encountered a time of felicity and entered the Mysterious Gate. Though our bodies remain mired in delusion, our masters have bestowed upon us the sacred texts. Yet driven by karmic entanglements, we stumble at every turn. In the three assemblies and five years of ordination, we have accomplished little merit; at the eight festivals and three origins, we have often neglected rites and recitations. On the ten fast days and our birthdays, we have failed to cultivate practice; on the days of Jiazi and Gengshen, we have not paid homage to the perfected or guarded the sacred precincts. Of the nine grades of purification rites, our minds have not been single-mindedly devoted; of the three thousand deeds of merit, we have never reverently upheld them. The precepts and prohibitions are most weighty, yet our every action incurs transgression; the commandments are majestic and stern, yet our frivolous speech compounds our faults. Our hearts and minds stray, violating one hundred and eighty precepts; our wisdom and discernment deeply transgress, forsaking the three hundred great commandments. We ourselves have created the three karmic deeds, and our misfortunes accumulate like mountains; the six desires and four entanglements plunge our transgressions as deep as the vast sea. Our offenses are recorded in the black registers, our sins bound in the nether courts. We constantly fear that when judgment comes, our bodies will be carved away and our lives wither in the repositories of fate.\n\nWe humbly beseech the Most Perfect and Most Sagely to distantly behold our sincere devotion, to remove death and ascend to life, to further extend our years, to forever extinguish calamities, to bestow upon us fortune and wisdom, to grant us ample emolument and long life. May we ever dwell in the shade of the Dharma, our wisdom penetrating the mysterious, forever dispelling delusion and confusion, practicing the Dao to attain perfection, and upholding the scriptures without transgression.\n\nHaving repented, with single-minded devotion, we prostrate to the Three Treasures.\n\nWith utmost sincerity, we vow:\nMay we, through kalpas past, broadly cultivate the goodness of the three karmic deeds.\nMay we constantly uphold the wondrous Dharma to save sentient beings,\nNever enmeshed in the snares of the dusty world.\nMay we, life after life, transcend the sufferings of the three evil paths,\nAnd attain a heart as bright as the sun of wisdom,\nAble to dispel darkness and illuminate the void,\nIn all Dharmas, free from the notions of self and others.\nMay we constantly arise in the compassionate practice of the One Vehicle,\nOur mouths ever savoring the sweet dew of gathas,\nProclaiming the pure precepts to deliver humans and celestials,\nNever uttering evil speech or frivolous words.\nMay we never consume the lives of beings that breathe blood,\nOur feet never tread the three evil paths.\nMay our hands never kill a single living being,\nOur bodies like shadows, aiding the Heavenly Worthies.\nIn sitting and rising, may we traverse without shunning the distant,\nWishing that all kinds, together with us,\nMay forsake the bodies of hungry ghosts and beasts,\nAnd with the celestials and humans of the three realms,\nAll diligently seek the supreme Dao.\n\nHaving made our vows, with single-minded devotion, we prostrate to the Three Treasures.\n\nAll listen to these words:\nAt this time, recite the verse of purity,\nIf you seek to return to the true Dao,\nLeave the worldly and dwell in the cliffs and peaks,\nThrice daily burn precious incense.\nWith steadfast hearts, diligently uphold the precepts,\nYou must forsake glory and emolument,\nLet not fame and profit entangle you.\nThen you will encounter a true person,\nWho will transmit to you the supreme Dao.\n\nThose in the upper, middle, and lower seats,\nEach remember the six recollections:\nRecollect Heaven, recollect Earth,\nRecollect the Dao, recollect the scriptures,\nRecollect the perfected, recollect the precepts.\n\nAll listen to the diligent upholding of the precepts:\nFirst, do not kill;\nSecond, do not steal;\nThird, do not engage in illicit sex;\nFourth, do not lie;\nFifth, do not indulge in wine or eat meat;\nSixth, do not slander the worthy and good.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy’s bequeathed teachings clearly exhort and admonish.\nStrive diligently in cultivation,\nSeek early liberation.\nThe human body is hard to obtain,\nBirth in the Middle Kingdom is hard to attain.\nOnce the human body is lost,\nFor ten thousand kalpas it is not regained.\nTherefore, I exhort you all,\nTogether return to this ritual arena.\nIn this life and the next,\nConstantly encounter the true scriptures and precepts.\n\nHaving admonished and exhorted, with single-minded devotion, we prostrate to the Three Treasures.\n\nHere concludes *The Wondrous Wisdom Hymn of Veneration from the Numinous Treasure of the Cavern of Mystery*.",
