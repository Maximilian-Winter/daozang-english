May the Four Seas be clear and tranquil, the Seven Ancestors joyful and at peace, the Three Paths flourishing, and the emperor’s reign prolonged.\n\nMay the host of this retreat, after making these prayers, inherit this merit, universally pervading the ten directions and ascending to all heavens, with misfortunes vanishing from the Nine Yin and blessings arising in the Ten Poles, overflowing with abundance. May the seven generations of parents depart from the long night of the Nine Yin and the Three Wretched Realms, and after repentance and atonement, ascend directly to heaven, dwelling eternally in radiant light, refining their forms in the Vermilion Palace, and transforming through rebirth.\n\nMay all members of the household, young and old, gain wisdom and intelligence, with all illnesses healed, their four limbs light and strong.

May all who partake be fully sated, enjoying the celestial kitchen’s bounty in this world. May the host’s virtue flow like water returning to the sea, their lineage enduring and flourishing, ever dwelling in nobility and prosperity. May the world and the Four Assemblies together know joy and happiness. May the seven generations of parents escape the long night of the Nine Yin’s dark abode. May their souls be free, disasters dispelled, blessings descended, and life and death transformed into ascension to immortality.\n\nMay the host, in every lifetime, cultivate a virtuous heart, establish virtue, revere the Dao, and protect the Dharma, planting the seeds of causes. May all their endeavors be blessed, their practice of the Dao lead to its attainment, and their quest for immortality succeed. May their body and spirit be at peace, their countenance radiant with luminous splendor, their comings and goings guided by benevolent spirits. Should they uphold the precepts and records, may officials and soldiers attend them, and may all present members of the household be secure. Should illness arise, may it be healed; may each enjoy longevity, their wishes fulfilled, rank and emolument naturally attained. May misfortune be averted, evil demons dispelled, and malevolent spirits subdued. May the sun, moon, and stars, the deities of heaven and earth, ever protect and guard their gates, shielding them from a thousand disasters and ten thousand calamities. May they receive blessings in this life and ultimately attain the immortal Dao.\n\n**Prayer for the Almsgiving to Sentient Beings**\nDiligently cultivate the great Dao,\nWith sincerity move the Supreme Darkness.\nThe true descends, demonic illusions scatter,\nAll malevolent spirits vanish without form.\nSeven ancestors ascend to the Southern Palace,\nThe self attains the Upper Clarity.\nBlessings and benefits universally pervade,\nSurplus food bestowed upon all beings.\n\n**Prayer for Receiving Almsgiving**\nBody, spirit, and life surrender to the Most High Three Honored Ones.\nToday, in this act of almsgiving, may the host and all beings be blessed. May misfortunes vanish from the Nine Yin and blessings arise in the ten directions, their virtue vast as mountains and seas, all flourishing without exception. May the seven ancestors be reborn in heaven, their descendants virtuous and loyal, their wealth and nobility towering. May all desires be fulfilled, their study of the Dao leading to ascension as immortals, riding clouds and mounting dragons.\n\nThe retreat participant so-and-so, devoting heart to the Dao and its teachings, has diminished their treasures and surplus goods to perform these meritorious deeds. May the offering of one measure of wealth bring immeasurable recompense. May the weight of their merit be met with abundant reward, ever uniting with goodness. May their karmic connections through lifetimes be perpetually joyful and prosperous. May all present, young and old, remain free from illness, ultimately preserving long life. May they give birth to worthy descendants, their wisdom clear and penetrating, revered across the Three Realms, guarded by true spirits. May the Five Directions’ righteous deities protect their gates, ensuring constant safety. May evil demons be bound, ghostly spirits extinguished, their dwellings secure, calamities unarisen, and blessings boundless. May they thereby ascend and transcend, their forms multiplying and transforming. May all sentient beings who partake be guided by the Dharma’s scriptures, all attaining unity with the Dao.\n\n**Prayer for Distributing Remnant Ritual Food to Sentient Beings**\nWhat day is today?\nA day of fasting, facing the Most High.\nPartaking of the celestial kitchen’s fare,\nCommanding this month’s celestial generals.\nMay you ascend to the Southern Immortals,\nThe host’s blessings immeasurable.\nBurning incense, offering utmost sincerity,\nMerit and virtue universally perfected.\n\nThe great ritual of vows to the four directions, as I have now expounded—if practiced with utmost sincerity, its blessings shall be boundless. Guard these precepts well.\n\nHere ends *The Most High Wondrous Treasure Scripture of the Four Directions’ Great Vows*.",
