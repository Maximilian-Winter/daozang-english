Release of Life**\n*Pure and Impure Affairs*\n\nIn the Nine Celestial Purity,\nHigh virtue shines upon the Most True;\nWithin the Six Harmonies,\nOne draws upon the boundless grace.\n\nWith reverence, the Daoist hearth offers sacred incense,\nAscending to the void to present petitions—\nHonoring the High Worthies of the Three Realms,\nThe Ten Radiant Saints of the Flowery Peak,\nAll celestial hosts of sun, moon, stars, and constellations,\nThe Three Sovereigns of the Three Eons,\nThe Four Celestial Saints of the Northern Pole,\nThe Five Lords of the Numinous Treasure,\nThe True Lord of the Orthodox Celestial Master,\nThe Nine Heavenly Celestial Tribunals and their sacred assemblies,\nThe spirits of the Five Sacred Mountains and Five Peaks,\nThe shadowy saints of the Underworld,\nThe Great Emperor of the Watery Expanse and the Vermilion Phoenix,\nAnd the True Sovereigns of the Three Realms and Ten Directions.\n\nWith reverence, we gaze upon the One that neither is nor is not,\nWithin which the void discerns the formless within the formless.\nTurning radiance and returning the chariot,\nWe oversee the True Ones in guiding sentient life.\n\nThe servant humbly submits:\nFrom the Primordial One, the forms of heaven, earth, and all beings were divided,\nAnd the Dao encompassed all transformations.\nAll living things display the symbols of movement, stillness, flight, and concealment,\nRanked among the Three Talents.\n\nThough their inherent endowments differ,\nThe essences of yin and yang remain inherent.\nAll crave life and abhor death,\nSeeking profit and avoiding harm in equal measure;\nAll thirst and hunger,\nStriving for sustenance and security alike.\nThese roots stem from the Ancestral Qi of the Primordial Origin,\nAnd truly arise from the True Essence of the Supreme Polarity.\n\nYet the vulgar masses stray from benevolence,\nPursuing worldly bonds and rejecting righteousness.\nOn land, they set snares and nets to ensnare the multitude;\nIn water, they cast hooks and traps to seize life.\nThe hunted, startled, flee in terror—\nHow have they offended to suffer thus?\n\nNow, with reverent obedience to the Imperial Edict,\nWe establish this Precious Hall in solemnity.\nProclaiming the Jade Standard,\nWe celebrate the completion of this sacred affair.\nGratefully bearing the Dao’s profound mercy,\nWe again uphold the Sovereign’s benevolent intent,\nTo redeem life itself.\n\nLoose them into forests and wilds,\nThat they may roam freely and at ease;\nRelease them into springs and streams,\nThat they may swim in tranquility and joy.\nThus, all may fulfill the delight of existence,\nAnd the boundless virtue be magnified.\n\nWith reverence, we gaze upon the Three Treasures’ Compassionate Sovereigns,\nAnd the Nine Celestial Saints above,\nWho condescend to our sincere devotion,\nPiercing the depths of our hearts.\nEmbodying the Sovereign’s vast heaven-earth benevolence,\nThey extend their enlightened designs;\nThus, all things—even those that transgress the heavens or plunge into the abyss—\nMay forever secure the Imperial Domain.\nLet all under heaven ascend together to benevolent longevity.\n\nWith bowed heads, we take refuge in the Boundless Dao.\n\nAll forms, high and low, flying and creeping,\nAre born from the Ancestral Qi of the Primordial.\nThrough countless eons, the karmic bonds of past lives were forged—\nNow, as disparate beings, we walk this path anew.\nEntangled in the nets of vengeance and debt,\nWe are redeemed by the mercy of forests and springs.\nDoing good brings auspicious blessings and eternal life,\nWhile virtue spreads across the land, bringing peace and prosperity.\n\n*Inconceivable merit and virtue.*\n\nHumbly, we reflect:\nTo transform suffering into enlightenment,\nBenevolence is vast and boundless;\nWith divine power, to transmute the foul into the pure,\nVirtue is profound and equal.\n\nThough the retributions of egg, womb, moisture, and transformation differ,\nThe mechanisms of birth, aging, sickness, and death remain the same.\nFortunate to escape the black net,\nWe now gather at the Pure Altar.\nHaving attained the state of non-birth,\nWe yet gain rebirth.\nHaving paid homage to the Holy Sovereign’s love for life,\nWe must ascend from thought to thoughtlessness,\nTogether surpassing the Dao’s lofty threshold.\n\nAwakening to the folly of past lives’ pursuits,\nRecognizing the joy of true nature’s return,\nWe follow the flow of causes,\nTranscending awareness to dwell in ease;\nWe abandon contrivance to wander freely,\nRealizing the Land of Blessings in festive repose.\nForever freed from the sufferings of scales, shells, feathers, and fur,\nWe attain the realm of tranquil, blissful life.\n\nThe virtue bestowed is not given in vain—\nWe must repay it as the pearls of gratitude;\nThe power of virtue must be steadily cultivated—\nWe must uphold it with the resolve of gold and stone.\n\nWith bowed heads, we take refuge in the Boundless Dao.\n\nFor countless lives, we wandered in the four forms,\nBound by karmic forces, our true nature obscured.\nFortunate to encounter the radiant light of mercy,\nWe cross to the other shore.\nAll malevolence is extinguished, debts of vengeance erased,\nAnd we return to the land of benevolent love.\nBoundless virtue knows no end—our gratitude is profound—\nSecrets of blessings descend, bestowing eternal spring.\n\n*Inconceivable merit and virtue.*\n\n**Rite for the Release of Life**\n\n「We humbly submit that the gathering of the wondrous virtue of tranquil repose and perfect harmony is achieved through the cultivation of lifelong refinement and practice. We pity the sentient beings, whose foolish yet vital emotions arise from the karmic debts of their past lives.\n\nThe six senses revolve endlessly, and the myriad kalpas cycle without cease.\nThere are hells and heavens, each with distinct ranks and paths;\nThere are no beings without suffering, nor creatures without life—\nAll, from the swiftest to the most hidden, share equally in the refining crucible of existence.\n\nWith the present **Dao/Way**’s **qi** permeating the world and the radiant light of wisdom illuminating below,\nThe **Supreme Sovereign** (天帝) universally reveals the blessings of the celestial nectar’s outpouring,\nAnd all sentient beings receive the **virtue/power** of rebirth, rising from the dead.\n\nLike clouds soaring high, the mountains deep and forests dense;\nLike rivers flowing broad, the seas serene and rivers clear.\nBorrowing the **virtue/power** of the **Sage Sovereign** (圣主) whose benevolence matches the heavens,\nWhose love for life is profound and whose compassion is boundless,\nWe sow the blessings of this auspicious moment,\nAnd extend the vast foundation of a billion ages.\n\nWe cultivate the **Spring Terrace** (春台) of the Nine Realms,\nAnd open the **Domain of Longevity** (寿域) across the Eight Expanse.\n\nWith hearts pure and devotion sincere, we recite the **Scriptures** (灵书) as prescribed.\nThe **Mid-Section of the Holy Text** (灵书中篇) is now invoked—\nFor the merit of **release of life** (放生) past and present,\nWe offer boundless virtuous causes.\n\nRelying on the **Three Jewels** (三宝) to bear witness,\nWe hope that all true beings may reflect upon this merit.\nWe humbly pray that **virtue/power** extend to grasses and trees,\nAnd transform harmoniously to insects and fish.\n\nThroughout the universe’s heights and depths,\nThe winds of benevolence blow without obstruction;\nWithin the heavens and earth’s round and square,\nThe radiant days of grace shine forth.\n\nMay all creatures, great and small, be blessed by this virtue,\nAnd no being be left without its share.\nWe repay the **virtue/power** of our birth and existence,\nAnd spread the benevolent **virtue/power** of nurturing and transformation.\n\nAll sentient beings shall return to the **True Dao/Way**.\nFor these causes and conditions above,\nWe invoke the **Inconceivable merit and virtue** of:\nThe **Lord of the Ten Thousand Lifespans of the Mysterious Realm** (玄都万寿天尊),\nThe **Lord of the Great Peace and Protection of the Realm** (太平护国天尊),\nThe **Lord of Compassionate Life and Saving of Beings** (好生度命天尊),\nAnd the **Lord of Boundless Life-Bringing Merit** (福生无量天尊).\n\n**The Golden Seal Rite for the Release of Life** is now complete.",
