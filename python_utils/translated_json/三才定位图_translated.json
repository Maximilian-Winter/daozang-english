Presented to the imperial court by Zhang Shangying of the Song Dynasty. Two texts in one scroll. Source text: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongzhen* Section, *Lingtu* Category.\n\n**Chapter Titles of the *Chart of the Three Powers’ Fixed Positions***\n\nPresented by Zhang Shangying, Grand Master for Thorough Service, Guardian of the Right Vice Director of the Department of State Affairs, Concurrently Palace Attendant of the Secretariat, Grand Pillar of the State, Duke of the Principality of Qinghe, with a fief of 2,900 households and an actual enfeoffment of 900 households.\n\n**Upper Chapter**\nThe *Spiritual Pivot* states: The summit of Kunlun Mountain is called Jade Capital Mountain. The Jade Capital Heavenly Thearch rules as the One of Heaven, surrounded by thirty-two Heavenly Thearchs in the four directions—altogether thirty-three Thearchs, which the Grand Historian referred to as the concealment of the sun and moon to form day and night.\n\nThe palace where the Jade Capital Heavenly Thearch resides, the *Biography of the Brilliant Sage* calls the Hall of Pervading Radiance, where the Thearch’s bodily light and the hall’s light illuminate each other.\n\nThe *Spiritual Pivot* states: Above the Jade Capital Heaven are the Three Pure Heavens.\nThe Grand Clarity Heaven, also called the Great Scarlet Heaven.\n*Liezi* also says: \"Looking up, one sees neither sun nor moon; looking down, one sees neither rivers nor seas.\" This describes this heaven.\n\nThe Highest Clarity Heaven, also called the Yu-Yu Heaven.\nThe Jade Clarity Heaven, also called the Qingwei Heaven. Here, the Nine August Ones descend with *qi*, initiating yin and yang, manifesting divine transformations, and bestowing joy upon self and others—this is this heaven.\n\nThe Heaven of the Void Thearch: This is where the True Nine August Ones descend with *qi* from above, and the wind below moistens the marsh to create the world. As *qi* possesses yin and yang, so people possess male and female, which the *Cavern Scripture* calls Jade Lads and Jade Maidens. This is why I have arranged the Three Pure Heavens as follows: Jade Clarity as the Qingwei Heaven, Highest Clarity as the Yu-Yu Heaven, and Grand Clarity as the Great Scarlet Heaven.\n\n**Lower Chapter**\nThe eight trigrams of the *Book of Changes* originate from the *qi* of the True Nine August Ones. Pure yang is *Qian*, residing in the northwest; pure yin is *Kun*, residing in the southwest. When the yang of *Qian* descends and seizes the yin within *Kun*, the center of *Kan* becomes solid and forms the moon. When the yin of *Kun* ascends and seizes the yang within *Qian*, the center of *Li* becomes hollow and forms the sun.\n\nThe moon receives the *qi* of the sun and moves through the twelve earthly branches. At the new moon, it is the body of *Kun*; at the full moon, it is the body of *Qian*. From the third to the seventh day, it emerges at *Geng* as *Zhen*; from the eighth to the twelfth day, it emerges at *Ding* as *Dui*; from the thirteenth to the seventeenth day, it emerges at *Jia* as *Qian*; from the eighteenth to the twenty-second day, it emerges at *Xin* as *Xun*; from the twenty-third to the twenty-seventh day, it emerges at *Wu* as *Gen*; from the twenty-eighth to the second day, it sets at *Yi* as *Kun*. Thus, five days make one *hou*, three *hou* make one *qi*, and the divisions of solstices, equinoxes, beginnings, and closings are thereby precise to the finest measure.\n\nAmong the sixty-four hexagrams of the *Book of Changes*, *Li* is fire and lightning, *Kan* is water and clouds, yet they do not represent the sun and moon. For the sun and moon transform *Qian*, *Kun*, *Zhen*, *Dui*, *Gen*, and *Xun* to complete the years, months, days, and hours. If they were confined to the images, their transformations would be hindered. The Han Confucians’ designation of the four cardinal trigrams as the lords of the directions and the six children as the functions of *Qian* and *Kun* are all conjectural theories.\n\nThe Three August Ones, the Five Thearchs, and Confucius used this to exhaust principle, fulfill nature, and attain destiny. If one does not unite with the spirit but relies on intellect, is this not what is meant by \"beyond this, there is nothing to be known\"?\n\n**Heaven of the Void Thearch**\nTrue Nine August Ones, Void Thearch of the Mysterious Elder, Void Thearch of the Mysterious Emperor, Void Thearch of the Mysterious Honored One, Void Thearch of the Mysterious Lord.\n\n**Jade Clarity Heaven**\nHeavenly Treasure Lord of the Jade Clarity Qingwei Heaven, Supreme Lord of the Purple Dao and Void, Great Supreme Dao Lord of the Winged Sun and Void, Primordial Lord of the Prosperous Yang and Void, Supreme Lord of the Sevenfold Stillness and Dao-Generated Void, Cavern Clarity Lord of the Great Brightness and Void, Great Empyrean Lord of the Primordial Void, Golden Spirit Lord of the Sevenfold Observance and Void-Generated, Radiant Lord of the Eightfold High Mystery and Void, Supreme Dao Lord of the Purple Radiance and Jade Clarity, Purple Void Supreme Realized King of the Nine Empyreans, Cavern Void Lord of the Three Origins and Great Brightness, Supreme Dao Lord of the Great Simplicity and High Void, Purple Orchid Lord of the Void Brightness and Central Origin, Supreme Dao Lord of the Eastern Brilliance and Void, Supreme Dao Lord of the Western Florescence and Void, Supreme Dao Lord of the Southern Vermilion and Void, Supreme Dao Lord of the Northern Perfection and Void, Supreme Dao Lord of the Central Origin and Void Union, Supreme Dao Lord of the Five Spirits and Sevenfold Brightness, Intermingled Generation.\n\nTrue Elder of the Three Origins and Supreme Void, True Lord of the Three Origins and Four Poles, Supreme Void, Primordial Spirit Lord of the Three Origins and Central Yellow Radiance, Primordial Womb Lord of the Three Origins and Purple Radiance.\n\nSupreme Lord of the Void, Jade Lord of the Supreme Void, Jade Emperor Lord of the August Supreme, Cavern Perfected Lord of the August Clarity, Supreme Lord of the Great Simplicity, Supreme Thearch of the Purple Void and August Supreme, Lord of the Myriad Beginnings and August Supreme, Purple Dawn Lord, Supreme Thearch of the Purple Void and Ancient Emperor, Azure Spirit Lord of the Yang Peace, True Lord of the Void and Great Perfection, Cavern Radiance Lord, Nonpareil Central Perfected Ancient Lord.\n\n**Highest Clarity Heaven**\nNuminous Treasure Lord of the Highest Clarity Yu-Yu Heaven, Supreme Dao Lord of the Three Origins and Purple Clarity, Cavern Radiance, Great Simplicity, Purple Dawn Lord of the Supreme Subtlety, Heavenly Emperor Dao Lord, Central Perfected Lord of the Four Dipper and Seven Dawns, Scattered Blossoms, Purple Void Lord of the Three Origins and Purple Essence, True Lord of the Nine Origins and Supreme Void, Supreme Clarity Lord of the Threefold Purple Essence, Supreme Lord of the Great Void and Empyrean Flight, Central Yellow Elder Dao Lord, Supreme Dao Lord of the Great Origin and Eastern Radiance, Fusang Vermilion Forest, Great Emperor of the Cinnabar Grove, Golden Watchtower Lord of the Posterior Sage and Great Peace, Li Perfected Heavenly Emperor, Supreme Lord of the Great Void and Posterior Sage, Primordial Radiance, Peng Palace Perfected Lord, Eastern Florescence Lord of the Square Reservoir Palace, Supreme Dawn Master, Jade Guardian King, Azure Lad Dao Lord, Supreme Lord of the Great Void and Dawn Center, Lord of the Central Cavern of Mount Emei, Jade Portal Lord of the Great Simplicity, Purple Void Jade Emperor, Purple Dawn Lord, Supreme Lord of the Great Brightness and Central Perfected, Nonpareil Lord, Nine August Supreme Perfected Lord of Life.\n\nEastern Supreme Origin Lesser Yang Azure Sovereign, Southern Pervading Yang Absorbing Yin Cinnabar Emperor, Western Lesser Yin Metallic White Emperor, Northern Pervading Yin Supreme Yang Black Emperor. Central Unifying Spirit Supreme August Yellow Emperor.\n\nGrand Clarity Heaven, Great Vermilion Grand Clarity Heaven’s Divine Treasure Lord; True Yang Primordial Elder Perfected Unity Dao Lord; Supreme Ultimate Great Dao Primordial Radiance Lord; Grand Clarity Great Dao Lord; August Four Elders Central Dao Lord; August Primordial Purple Spirit Primordial Lord; Supreme Origin Ninefold Simplicity Golden Florescence Radiance Primordial Lord; Primordial Void Yellow Chamber Perfected Dawn Lord; Azure Essence Supreme Perfected Inner Radiance Lord; Heavenly August Supreme Perfected Jade Florescence Threefold Primordial Lord; Perfected Continent Two Masters Nine Perfected Earls Supreme Thearch Controllers of Prohibitions; Supreme Ultimate Lords of the Four Perfected; Dawn Center Yellow Radiance Primordial Lord; Supreme Clarity Eight August Elders Lord; Grotto Clarity Lesser Existence Jade Perfected Myriad Florescence Master of Charts Jade Lord; Supreme Unity Supreme Origin Prohibition Lord; Supreme Yang Ninefold Black Jade Worthies Primordial Lord; Supreme Perfected Capital Ninefold Black Venerable Master of Immortals; Western Origin Turtle Mountain Ninefold Numinous Perfected Immortal Mother Azure-Golden Elixir August Lord.\n\nThe Eight Trigrams Descend in Darkness\nThe Dao speaks: Prior to the Supreme Unity, its form was spontaneous.\n\nThe Supreme Unity is the primordial qi of the Original One, first born within the Great Void. It resides within the boundless and infinite, dwelling at the inception of formlessness and imagelessness—hence it is called the Supreme Unity. Above is wind, below is water; these two qi intermingle and settle. Above the Great Void lies the Heaven of Jade Capital, which is Jade Capital Mountain. The \"contained lotus\" refers to the qi of the Six Origins, which, moved by the numinous spirits of the Nine August Celestial Perfected, descend to divide the semblance of primordial chaos. At the first flourishing, transformation begins, and the uncarved simplicity arranges itself into the wheel of wind and water; at the second flourishing, the qi intermingle and settle.\n\nAbove Jade Capital, to the east, south, west, and north, lie eight heavens each—thirty-two heavens in total, with one hundred and twenty-two Thearchs. Above Jade Capital lies the Three Clarities Heaven, which comprises the Heaven of Jade Clarity’s Sacred Realm, the Heaven of Highest Clarity’s Perfected Realm, and the Heaven of Supreme Clarity’s Immortal Realm. Above the Three Clarities Heaven lie the Ten Heavens of the Void August, wherein dwell the Void August Primordial Elders, Void August Primordial Lords, Void August Primordial Thearchs, Void August Primordial Venerables, and the Celestial Perfected Nine August Realized Ones.\n\nThe Celestial Perfected August Ones descend the Nine Flourishings of Celestial Perfection, dividing the Six Origins to form the semblance of primordial chaos. Lesser Yang corresponds to Qian, its emblem being metal; the Nine August Celestial Perfected descend the first flourishing of the Golden Perfected, born within water, its form like playful medicine. Its semblance transforms: above, red; below, black; left, azure; right, white; and at its center, yellow. It revolves within, concealing this qi. Lesser Yin corresponds to Xun, its emblem being wood; the Nine August Celestial Perfected descend the second flourishing of the Wooden Perfected, born within wind, its form like playful medicine. Its semblance transforms: above, black; below, red; left, white; right, azure; and at its center, yellow. It revolves within, concealing this flourishing.\n\nGreater Yin corresponds to Kan, its emblem being the virtue of water reversing fire; the Nine August Celestial Perfected descend the third flourishing of the Water Virtue Fire Perfected, born within water, its form like an embraced egg. Greater Yang corresponds to Li, its emblem being the virtue of fire reversing water; the Nine August Celestial Perfected descend the fourth flourishing of the Fire Virtue Water Perfected, born within wind, its form like an embraced egg. Yang Brightness corresponds to Zhen, its emblem being wood; the Nine August Celestial Perfected descend the fifth flourishing of the Wooden Perfected, born within water, its form like a contained lotus. Greater Yin corresponds to Dui, its emblem being metal; the Nine August Celestial Perfected descend the sixth flourishing of the Golden Perfected, born within wind, its form like a contained lotus.\n\nThe Three Yangs converge at Gen, its emblem being earth; the Nine August Celestial Perfected descend the seventh flourishing of the Earth Perfected, moved by earth to be born in the upper expanse. It scatters and transforms into heaven—thus pure yang becomes heaven, while the remaining flourishings scatter and transform into the sun, moon, and stars. The Three Yins converge at Kun, its emblem being earth; the Nine August Celestial Perfected descend the eighth flourishing of the Earth Perfected, moved by earth to open below. It scatters and transforms into earth—thus turbid yin becomes earth, while the remaining flourishings fuse and congeal into mountains, rivers, metals, and stones, thereby manifesting the true Dao of spontaneity.\n\nJade Capital Heaven and Jade Capital Mountain’s Luminous Hall:\nAugust Jade Thearch of the Vast Heaven, the Memorial-Presenting Youth;\nEight Heavens of the East, Eight Heavens of the South, Eight Heavens of the West, Eight Heavens of the North.\nThe Gate of Change:\nGenerals Tang, Ge, and Zhou; the Communicating Perfected Envoys lead the way, as Perfected Zhang receives the memorial, and the Memorial Youth presents the document.\nMarshal Tianpeng the Great, Marshal Tianyou the Great, Perfected Lord of Protective Virtue and Numinous Response, and Perfected Lord of Numinous Might and Protective Sagacity.\nHeavenly Kings of the East, South, West, and North.\n\nPurple Tenuity Enclosure:\nGreat Thearch of the Heavenly August, Purple Tenuity Thearch Lord;\nLords of the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper;\nThearch Lord of the Great Yang, Thearch Lord of the Great Yin, Star Lords of Wood Virtue, Fire Virtue, Metal Virtue, Water Virtue, Earth Virtue, Rāhu, Ketu, Purple Qi, and Comet;\nStar Lords of the Seven Mansions of the East, Seven Mansions of the South, Seven Mansions of the West, and Seven Mansions of the North.\n\nSix Palaces of Fengdu:\nPalace of Yin’s Utter Extinction, Palace of Grand Slaughter and Solemn Affairs, Palace of Bright Dawn and Enduring Offenses, Palace of Serene Illumination and Sinister Darkness, Palace of the Sevenfold Transgressions of the Ancestral Numen, Palace of Daring Governance and Repeated Offenses.\n\nDiagram of the Three Powers’ Fixed Positions:\nAbove the Three Clarities Heaven lie the Ten Heavens of the Void August, wherein dwell the Void August Primordial Elders, Void August Primordial Lords, Void August Primordial Thearchs, Void August Primordial Venerables, and the Celestial Perfected Nine August Ones.\n\nThree Heavens of the Void August:\nFirst revolution: red; second: yellow; third: white; fourth: azure;\nFifth: black; sixth: red; seventh: azure; eighth: white; ninth: yellow.\nThe Heavenly Venerable’s head is azure, the sash behind is the same.\nVoid August Primordial Venerable,\nVoid August Primordial Elders.\n\nThe Nine Celestial Perfected August Ones",

      "translated_text": "The Supreme Unity is the primordial qi of the Original One, first born within the Great Void. It resides within the boundless and infinite, dwelling at the inception of formlessness and imagelessness—hence it is called the Supreme Unity. Above is wind, below is water; these two qi intermingle and settle. Above the Great Void lies the Heaven of Jade Capital, which is Jade Capital Mountain. The \"contained lotus\" refers to the qi of the Six Origins, which, moved by the numinous spirits of the Nine August Celestial Perfected, descend to divide the semblance of primordial chaos. At the first flourishing, transformation begins, and the uncarved simplicity arranges itself into the wheel of wind and water; at the second flourishing, the qi intermingle and settle.\n\nAbove Jade Capital, to the east, south, west, and north, lie eight heavens each—thirty-two heavens in total, with one hundred and twenty-two Thearchs. Above Jade Capital lies the Three Clarities Heaven, which comprises the Heaven of Jade Clarity’s Sacred Realm, the Heaven of Highest Clarity’s Perfected Realm, and the Heaven of Supreme Clarity’s Immortal Realm. Above the Three Clarities Heaven lie the Ten Heavens of the Void August, wherein dwell the Void August Primordial Elders, Void August Primordial Lords, Void August Primordial Thearchs, Void August Primordial Venerables, and the Celestial Perfected Nine August Realized Ones.\n\nThe Celestial Perfected August Ones descend the Nine Flourishings of Celestial Perfection, dividing the Six Origins to form the semblance of primordial chaos. Lesser Yang corresponds to Qian, its emblem being metal; the Nine August Celestial Perfected descend the first flourishing of the Golden Perfected, born within water, its form like playful medicine. Its semblance transforms: above, red; below, black; left, azure; right, white; and at its center, yellow. It revolves within, concealing this qi. Lesser Yin corresponds to Xun, its emblem being wood; the Nine August Celestial Perfected descend the second flourishing of the Wooden Perfected, born within wind, its form like playful medicine. Its semblance transforms: above, black; below, red; left, white; right, azure; and at its center, yellow. It revolves within, concealing this flourishing.\n\nGreater Yin corresponds to Kan, its emblem being the virtue of water reversing fire; the Nine August Celestial Perfected descend the third flourishing of the Water Virtue Fire Perfected, born within water, its form like an embraced egg. Greater Yang corresponds to Li, its emblem being the virtue of fire reversing water; the Nine August Celestial Perfected descend the fourth flourishing of the Fire Virtue Water Perfected, born within wind, its form like an embraced egg. Yang Brightness corresponds to Zhen, its emblem being wood; the Nine August Celestial Perfected descend the fifth flourishing of the Wooden Perfected, born within water, its form like a contained lotus. Greater Yin corresponds to Dui, its emblem being metal; the Nine August Celestial Perfected descend the sixth flourishing of the Golden Perfected, born within wind, its form like a contained lotus.\n\nThe Three Yangs converge at Gen, its emblem being earth; the Nine August Celestial Perfected descend the seventh flourishing of the Earth Perfected, moved by earth to be born in the upper expanse. It scatters and transforms into heaven—thus pure yang becomes heaven, while the remaining flourishings scatter and transform into the sun, moon, and stars. The Three Yins converge at Kun, its emblem being earth; the Nine August Celestial Perfected descend the eighth flourishing of the Earth Perfected, moved by earth to open below. It scatters and transforms into earth—thus turbid yin becomes earth, while the remaining flourishings fuse and congeal into mountains, rivers, metals, and stones, thereby manifesting the true Dao of spontaneity.\n\nJade Capital Heaven and Jade Capital Mountain’s Luminous Hall:\nAugust Jade Thearch of the Vast Heaven, the Memorial-Presenting Youth;\nEight Heavens of the East, Eight Heavens of the South, Eight Heavens of the West, Eight Heavens of the North.\nThe Gate of Change:\nGenerals Tang, Ge, and Zhou; the Communicating Perfected Envoys lead the way, as Perfected Zhang receives the memorial, and the Memorial Youth presents the document.\nMarshal Tianpeng the Great, Marshal Tianyou the Great, Perfected Lord of Protective Virtue and Numinous Response, and Perfected Lord of Numinous Might and Protective Sagacity.\nHeavenly Kings of the East, South, West, and North.\n\nPurple Tenuity Enclosure:\nGreat Thearch of the Heavenly August, Purple Tenuity Thearch Lord;\nLords of the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper;\nThearch Lord of the Great Yang, Thearch Lord of the Great Yin, Star Lords of Wood Virtue, Fire Virtue, Metal Virtue, Water Virtue, Earth Virtue, Rāhu, Ketu, Purple Qi, and Comet;\nStar Lords of the Seven Mansions of the East, Seven Mansions of the South, Seven Mansions of the West, and Seven Mansions of the North.\n\nSix Palaces of Fengdu:\nPalace of Yin’s Utter Extinction, Palace of Grand Slaughter and Solemn Affairs, Palace of Bright Dawn and Enduring Offenses, Palace of Serene Illumination and Sinister Darkness, Palace of the Sevenfold Transgressions of the Ancestral Numen, Palace of Daring Governance and Repeated Offenses.\n\nDiagram of the Three Powers’ Fixed Positions:\nAbove the Three Clarities Heaven lie the Ten Heavens of the Void August, wherein dwell the Void August Primordial Elders, Void August Primordial Lords, Void August Primordial Thearchs, Void August Primordial Venerables, and the Celestial Perfected Nine August Ones.\n\nThree Heavens of the Void August:\nFirst revolution: red; second: yellow; third: white; fourth: azure;\nFifth: black; sixth: red; seventh: azure; eighth: white; ninth: yellow.\nThe Heavenly Venerable’s head is azure, the sash behind is the same.\nVoid August Primordial Venerable,\nVoid August Primordial Elders.",
