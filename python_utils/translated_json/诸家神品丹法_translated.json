  "full_translation": "**Collected Divine-Grade Alchemical Methods**\n\n**Title:** *Collected Divine-Grade Alchemical Methods*. The compiler is unknown, but it likely dates to the Song dynasty. It compiles alchemical formulas and secrets from various masters, including the *Baopuzi*, Meng Yaofu, Sun the Perfected, and Lü Dongbin. Six fascicles. Base text from: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongshen* section, *Zhongshu* category.\n\n---\n\n**Collected Divine-Grade Alchemical Methods, Fascicle One**\n\n**Inner Chapters of the *Baopuzi***\n\nThe *Baopuzi* states: The methods of divine transcendence and the Yellow and White arts comprise twenty-five fascicles, containing over a thousand entries. The \"Yellow\" refers to gold, and the \"White\" to silver. The ancients guarded these methods in secrecy, unwilling to name them directly, and thus concealed them. Some texts title them *Gengxin*—*Gengxin* also signifies metal. Yet most of these methods are profound and abstruse, with only a fraction comprehensible.\n\nThe world often doubts such matters as fantastical, no different from those who disbelieve in divine transcendence. In the past, I followed Master Zheng and Master Zuo in testing these methods in the mountains of Lu, and all succeeded. However, the rigor of their purification rites and taboos was no less arduous than that of compounding the Nine Elixirs of immortality.\n\nVulgar folk often mock me for pursuing heterodoxies, striving to master what the world deems unmasterable. Yet why would I do so? If my aim were merely to display literary skill for posterity, my *Outer Chapters* and miscellaneous writings—over two hundred fascicles—would suffice to convey my intent to later generations. No need for these methods. Moreover, the *Inner Chapters* are written in plain speech, without embellishment.\n\nThe world deems me impractical, neglecting urgent worldly concerns in favor of obscure principles that fail to win popular approval. Yet I cannot abandon these pursuits, for I have witnessed their efficacy. I follow my masters’ teachings not idly, but I am poor, lacking resources, and beset by misfortune. Roads are blocked, ingredients scarce, and I have had no leisure to practice. Now, when I tell others I know how to make gold and silver, yet suffer hunger and cold myself, how is this different from one who cannot walk yet sells remedies for fractures? Who would believe me?\n\nYet not all things go as one wishes; one cannot dismiss them outright. Thus, I diligently record these methods in writing, hoping that those who cherish the strange and prize truth may read my words and grasp their intent.\n\nMan’s power of transformation knows no bounds. The body’s visible form may be concealed, while ghosts and spirits, though hidden, may be revealed—those who master such arts are many. Fire and water exist in the heavens, yet we obtain them through the *yang* mirror and the *fangzhu*. Lead is inherently white, yet it may be reddened into cinnabar. Cinnabar is inherently red, yet it may be whitened into lead. Clouds, rain, frost, and snow are all qi of Heaven and Earth, yet with the right ingredients, they may be wrought into the genuine—no different from the transformations of birds and beasts, insects and worms, which, though shaped by creation, possess fixed forms. Yet in an instant, they may shed their old bodies and become something else, their myriad changes too numerous to recount.\n\nMan is the most numinous of beings, yet men and women may alter their forms—into swans, into stones, into tigers, into owls, into serpents, into lightning, or into mandarin ducks. Even great things transform: mountains become abysses, empty valleys rise into hills. Such changes are the natural workings of Heaven and Earth. Why, then, should it be impossible to transmute other things into gold and silver?\n\nConsider the fire obtained from the *yang* mirror or the water drawn from the *fangzhu*—are they different from ordinary fire and water? When a serpent becomes a dragon, or when thatch is refined into grease, are these not the same as their naturally occurring counterparts? Trace their origins, and all arise from the spontaneous resonance of the Dao. Those who do not exhaust principle and fulfill their nature cannot grasp their ultimate meaning. Those who do not trace things back to their beginnings and return to their ends cannot perceive their true forms.\n\nThose with narrow vision and shallow knowledge, unable to seek what lies beyond, dismiss these arts as fantastical because Confucius did not speak of them and the ancient texts do not record them. How crude! It is also said: When Liu Xiang failed to make gold, he declared the world held no such method. This is like a farmer, upon suffering drought or flood, concluding that the Five Grains cannot be sown.\n\nWu Taiwen, the Prefect of Chengdu, was learned and widely informed. He recounted studying under the Daoist Li Gen, who smelted lead and tin, adding a small amount of medicine—no larger than a soybean—and stirring with an iron rod. Upon cooling, it became silver. Taiwen obtained the secret method but, constantly occupied with official duties, never practiced it, and often sighed in regret.\n\nHuan Junshan spoke of Cheng Wei, a Gentleman of the Yellow Gate who was fond of the Yellow and White arts. He married a woman who knew the method. Once, when Wei was to accompany the imperial procession but lacked proper attire, he grew anxious. His wife said, \"Let me procure two bolts of silk.\" Though the silk was old, it soon appeared before them. Wei followed the *Hongbao* in his *Pillow Book* to make gold but failed. His wife went to inspect and found him fanning the coals, with mercury in the fire. She said, \"Let me show you something,\" and took a small amount of medicine from her pouch, casting it in. After the time it takes to eat a meal, she raked it out—it had turned to silver.\n\nWei was astonished and said, \"The Dao lies with you! Why did you not tell me sooner?\" She replied, \"One must be destined to receive it.\" Wei then entreated her day and night, selling fields and houses to provide for her, yet she still refused to teach him. He resorted to beating and torturing her. She said, \"The Dao must be transmitted to the right person. Even if we met by chance on the road, I would impart it thus. But if one’s mouth says yes while their heart says no, even if you cut me to pieces, the Dao would not pass my lips.\" Wei pressed her relentlessly. She then went mad, stripped naked, and ran off, smearing herself with mud until she died.\n\nMore recently, Hua Ling, the Prefect of Lujiang—a man of lofty talent and broad learning—was skeptical of extraordinary matters.\n\nLater, a Daoist spoke to him of the art of *huangbai* (transmuting base metals into silver and gold). Hua Ling tested him by having him perform it: iron vessels were used to melt lead, and when powdered elixir was cast into the molten metal, it turned to silver. This silver was then melted again, and another elixir was added, transmuting it into gold.\n\nHua Ling also studied the art of *cheshi* (penetrating vision) from this Daoist. Before a hundred days had passed, he could see clearly at night as if it were day—celestial patterns, the outlines of houses and fences, even the details of his neighbors’ homes, all became vividly apparent. His late wife, named Yaohua, appeared before him in visible form and spoke of their past life together. When he worshipped at a temple, the spirits responded to his obeisance.\n\nHua Ling sighed in wonder, saying: \"Such things are not recorded in the world, nor are they found in the Five Classics—yet they cannot be dismissed as mere imagination. Even those unfamiliar with esoteric arts would be astonished upon hearing of them. Moreover, the practice of *huangbai* is like the concoction of divine elixirs: both require a hundred days or more of purification and fasting. Some methods demand oral instructions, all of which must be transmitted by a master. One should also enter the depths of secluded mountains, to a place of purity, where the uninitiated cannot witness the process. In the past, Liu Xiang attempted it within the palace, having palace women attend to him. Yet they were not purified, nor could he sever worldly ties or prevent others from coming and going—how could he have succeeded? Even dyeing silk or bleaching cloth requires keeping it from the sight of outsiders, lest the process be ruined. How much more so for the transformations of *huangbai*?\n\nIn all matters, great or small, one must grasp the essentials. If one cannot even brew fine wine or prepare a proper meal, how can one hope to accomplish greater things? As Master Zheng once said: When a perfected person creates gold, they consume it themselves to attain immortality—not to amass wealth. Thus, the scriptures say: *Gold can be made, but the world cannot be transcended.* Silver may also be consumed, though it is not as potent as gold.\n\nI once questioned this, asking: If gold and silver already exist in the world, why transmute them? And if they are transmuted, they are not genuine—would that not be deception? Master Zheng replied: Worldly gold and silver *can* be consumed, but Daoists are often poor. As the saying goes: *There are no fat immortals, only wealthy Daoists.* With five or ten disciples, how could one afford to provide them with gold and silver? Moreover, they lack the means to obtain it, so transmutation is necessary. Furthermore, the gold produced through alchemy is the essence of various medicines—superior even to natural gold. The *Scriptures of Divine Immortals* state: *Cinnabar essence generates gold.* This refers to creating gold from elixirs. Thus, in the mountains, where cinnabar is found above, gold often lies below.\n\nOnce transmuted, the gold is a true substance—refined a hundred times, it does not diminish. This follows the natural Dao of heaven and earth, so how can it be called deception? Deception is like coating iron with malachite to turn it red, or using egg white to alter copper into something resembling gold—these change only the surface, not the essence. Lingzhi mushrooms grow naturally, yet the immortals’ scriptures describe cultivating them from five stones and five woods, harvesting and consuming them to attain longevity. These are no different from wild lingzhi, just as transmuted gold is no different from natural gold. The pheasant transforms into a clam, the sparrow into a mussel—these are no different from their naturally occurring counterparts. Thus, the scriptures say: *The flowing pearl, after nine refinements, a father does not teach his son. Transmuting into yellow and white, nature itself assists.* And again: *Cinnabar made into gold, consumed to ascend as an immortal—this is the path of the superior adept. Eating lingzhi and practicing breath control to attain long life—this is the way of the middling adept. Consuming herbs and grasses to live a thousand years—this is the practice of the inferior adept.*\n\nThe *Jade Tablet Record* states: *All under heaven may live forever—only hesitation prevents success.* The *Bronze Pillar Scripture* says: *Cinnabar can be made into gold; the river chariot can produce silver in an instant. Once achieved, it is genuine. Master its Dao, and you may attain an immortal’s body.* Huangshanzi said: *Heaven and earth contain gold—I can make it. Two yellows and one red, formed without doubt.* The *Tortoise Shell Scripture* declares: *My life is in my hands, not heaven’s. The returning elixir becomes gold, enduring for ten thousand years.* How could the ancients have deceived us?\n\nThe problem is that those who know this Dao are often poor, and the medicines grow in distant lands, unobtainable in times of chaos. Saltpeter, brine, and other minerals were once so cheap in peaceful times as to be nearly worthless—now, they are priceless, and even then, one cannot find them. Qiangli realgar is sought by the thousand, yet a single catty is hard to come by. Many know the methods, yet without the means, they are no better off than the ignorant. What a lamentable state!\n\nThose who possess the method may still suffer hunger and cold, unable to gather the ingredients.\n\nYet those who are wealthy and noble, in turn, do not know the method. Even if they were to know it, scarcely one in ten thousand would believe. And even if they did believe, they already possess abundant gold and silver—why would they spend their visible wealth to purchase the medicines? Fearing the regret of chasing mirages and pursuing the ephemeral, none are willing to attempt it.\n\nMoreover, without the oral instructions of an enlightened master, one must not act rashly. The formulas and medicines of physicians are quite openly revealed, yet when their masters employ them to achieve results, they again conceal them. Thus, formulas are sealed with glue from the secluded women of the rear palace. Cinnabar of the Mud-Pill, Wooden Ghost Seeds, Golden Millet Mushrooms, Flying Soldier Roots, Crouching Dragon Liver, White Horse Sweat, Floating Cloud Marsh, Dragon’s Robe, Night-Shining Bones, Hundred-Flower Nectar, Winter Tsou Qi, and the like—these are all common substances. Yet without the oral instructions, they remain unknowable. How much more so for the alchemy of the Yellow and White? It is not merely their cost that is concealed.\n\nThis Dao, once perfected, grants longevity—thus the ancients valued it highly. The names of medicinal substances in formula books may coincide with common drugs yet differ in reality. For example, the \"Old Woman of the Riverbank\" is not a woman; \"Master Ziming of Lingyang\" is not a man; \"Yu’s Remnant Root\" is not rice; \"Yao’s Brew\" is not water. Yet when ordinary people see formulas calling for dragon’s gall, tiger’s paw, chicken’s head, duck’s foot, horse’s lung, dog’s blood, rat’s tail, or ox’s knee, they assume them to be dark-blooded things. When they see broken cups, overturned basins, cauldron clappers, spurge, ghost arrows, or celestial hooks, they take them for iron and pottery vessels. When they see \"Hu King’s Envoy,\" \"Leaning Withered Woman,\" \"Wild Husband,\" \"Field Guardian,\" \"Dai Wenluo,\" or \"Xu Changqing,\" they assume them to be human names—so close at hand! Without knowing the arcane formulas, who could fully comprehend them?\n\nLiu Xiang failed to transmute gold—was this truly surprising? Had he grasped the essentials, he would not have required the talents of sages and worthies to succeed; any ordinary person could have done so. Was Liu Xiang a dullard? He simply lacked the oral instructions.\n\nNow, I shall record the concise and effective methods to bequeath to like-minded seekers of the future.\n\nFirst, obtain Wu Du realgar, its color like a rooster’s comb and lustrous, free of impurities. The quantity is at your discretion, but do not use less than five catties. Pound it to powder, mix it with ox gall, and boil it into granules. Prepare a red-clay cauldron with a one-dou capacity. First, line the cauldron with a three-fen layer of Qiang salt and chalcanthite powder. Then add a five-fen layer of realgar powder, followed by another layer of Qiang salt. Repeat this sequence until all is used. Add crushed charcoal the size of jujube pits to a depth of two cun. Seal the cauldron’s exterior with a mixture of earthworm soil and Qiang brine, then cover it with another cauldron, sealing both with a two-cun layer of the same mixture to prevent qi leakage. Dry in the shade for a month, then warm with horse-dung fire for three days and nights. When cool, open it to find the bronze below, flowing like cold copper or iron. Cast this bronze into a crucible, fill it with cinnabar water, and warm it with horse-dung fire for forty days. Open it, and refine the bronze to obtain *geng*. Use the *geng* to make another crucible, fill it again with cinnabar water, and warm it with horse-dung fire for thirty days. Open it, refine the contents, and grind them. Take two parts raw cinnabar and one part cinnabar powder (mercury is quicksilver), and it will immediately become yellow gold—lustrous and beautiful, fit for consumption.\n\n**Method for Making Cinnabar Water**\nTreat one catty of cinnabar, place it in a bamboo crucible, and add two liang each of chalcanthite and saltpeter, layering them above and below. Seal the crucible’s mouth with lacquer-bone pellets and let it dry. Fill a jar with several sheng of strong bitter wine, place the crucible inside, and bury it three chi deep in the earth. After thirty days, it will become a watery liquid, red in color and bitter in taste.\n\n**Master Jin Lou’s Method for Transmuting Gold (Learned from Master Qing Lin)**\nFirst, refine tin into squares six cun wide and one cun and one fen thick. Mix red salt with limewater to a mud-like consistency, coat the tin with a one-fen layer, and stack it in a red-clay cauldron. For every ten catties of tin, use four catties of red brine. Seal the cauldron’s seams, warm it with horse-dung fire for thirty days, then open it. The tin will appear entirely ashen, with bean-sized granules within—this is *geng*. Combine and refine it in a jar with charcoal fire to complete the process. For every ten catties of tin, you will obtain twenty liang of *geng*. Only the red-clay cauldrons of Changsha, Guiyang, Yuzhang, and Nanhai are suitable; the locals use them for cooking, so they are readily available.\n\n**Method for Making Red Brine**\nUse one catty each of cold salt and feather mud, combine them in an iron vessel, and heat with charcoal fire until melted. Remove and use when cool.\n\n**Master Jiaoli’s Method for Making *Geng* (Learned from Master Jiqiu)**\nFirst, take two parts alum water in an iron vessel and heat it over charcoal fire until boiling. Add mercury in any quantity, stir until well combined, and boil sixty to seventy times. Pour onto the ground to form white silver, then collect it. Take one part each of cinnabar water and azurite water, and two parts of realgar water, and heat them in a crucible over a gentle fire until boiling. Add the white silver in any quantity, boil six to seven times, and pour onto the ground to obtain high-quality purple-polished *geng*. Stir repeatedly to ensure thorough mixing, then add charcoal fire to bring to a boil—this is the essential technique.\n\n**Method for Making Realgar Water**\nTreat realgar, place one catty in a fresh bamboo crucible, add two liang of saltpeter, layer above and below, seal with lacquer-bone pellets, and immerse in bitter wine. Bury it three chi deep in a shady place for twenty days to complete.\n\n**Method for Making Azure-White Pellet Stone Water**\n\n**Method for Azure-White Water and Pellet Stone Water**\nThe method is the same, only differing in the crucibles used.\n\n**Method for Making *Geng* with a Young Boy**\nPrepare a large iron crucible, twelve *cun* in diameter and one *chi* in height. Prepare a small iron crucible, six *cun* in diameter, and polish it smooth. Take one *jin* each of red halloysite, saltpeter, mica, hematite, and calcite; half a *jin* of sulfur; four *liang* of malachite; and one *jin* of stalactite. Grind them all finely, sift, and mix with fermented liquid to coat the small crucible to a thickness of two *fen*. Take one *jin* of mercury, half a *jin* of cinnabar, and half a *jin* of *liangfei*, stir until thoroughly blended, and no mercury is visible. Place this in the small crucible, cover it with mica, and secure the iron lid. Set the large crucible over a furnace, melt lead, and pour it into the large crucible until it submerges the small crucible by half a *cun*. When the lead is fully molten, apply a fierce fire and blow for three days and nights to produce *zifen*. Take ten *jin* of lead, melt it in an iron vessel, then transfer it to a copper vessel after twenty days. For every seven *fangcunbi* of lead *zifen* consumed, yellow *geng* is formed. To make white silver, place lead in an iron vessel, add a *fangcunbi* of *zifen*, heat until blended, and pour into water to obtain silver.\n\n**Method for Making *Liangfei***\nTake ten *jin* of lead, place it in an iron vessel, and heat it over an open fire. Add three *liang* of mercury, and promptly scoop out the early-formed substance with an iron ladle—this is *liangfei*.\n\n**Method for Making *Geng* by Master Wucheng**\nPrepare a crucible nine *cun* long and five *cun* in diameter. Grind three *jin* of realgar and an equal portion of earthworm soil into a paste, coat the crucible to a thickness of three *cun*, leaving a four-*cun* opening. Cover with two *ge* of cinnabar water, dry thoroughly over horse dung fire, place in a paulownia box, seal with a copper lid, and firmly pack with yellow sand. Apply another layer of earthworm soil to prevent any leakage of *qi*. Place in a charcoal fire, ensuring three *cun* of charcoal above, until the crucible’s mouth glows red, then cool it. Open to find the realgar absorbed into the copper crucible; remove it. Repeat the process until all three *jin* of realgar are absorbed. Mix the extracted substance with an equal portion of lead oxide to form a furnace of any desired size. To use, place the furnace in charcoal until red-hot, add mercury, then lead. When the yellow substance rises from the sides to the center, pour onto the ground to form yellow *geng*. Each furnace can produce three thousand five hundred *jin* before its power is exhausted.\n\nThis *geng* is softened by soaking *zhuangjing* seeds and red millet in wine for a hundred days, then rolled into pellets the size of small beans. Take one pellet three times daily; consuming one *jin* expels the three worms, corpse *qi*, and all diseases. The blind regain sight, the deaf hear, the aged become youthful, and one remains unburned by fire. No evil, poison, cold, heat, dampness, or toxin can harm them. Consuming three *jin* allows walking on water and mountains, with all spirits attending and guarding, granting life as long as heaven’s. Boil one pellet with coffin blood and *zhucao* to wipe the eyes, enabling sight of ghosts and subterranean objects, and writing in darkness. Coat one pellet with white sheep’s blood and hang it above the city gate to summon dragons standing in pairs. Coat one pellet with black ox blood and red rooster blood, hang it above the city gate, and the area within one *li* will be free of plague. Apply the medicine to cattle, sheep, and livestock to prevent plague, and tigers and leopards will not attack. Mix one pellet with tiger gall and snake fat, throw it toward the enemy’s army on a day corresponding to the lunar mansion, and they will turn on each other in chaos and flee. Coat one pellet with horse blood and cast it into a well to make the water boil, or into a stream to reverse its flow for a hundred paces. Coat one pellet with white dog’s blood and place it in a shrine to manifest its spirits, who can be commanded. Coat one pellet with rabbit blood and consume it, then place another pellet in a place of six *yin* energies to summon jade maidens who can serve sixty or seventy people. Coat one pellet with carp gall and carry it into water to part the waves ten *zhang* deep, allowing breath and movement underwater, and keeping clothes dry in rain. Boil one pellet with purple amaranth, hold it in the mouth, and swallow its juice to go a hundred days without hunger. Boil one pellet with magnetite and place it in the hair; striking an enemy will deflect blades and arrows, and any arrows shot will turn back. Mix one pellet with soil from the days of the Six *Ding* and Six *Ren* gods to conceal oneself when applied to the philtrum. Hold one pellet, face north, and spit at a great fire to extinguish it. At the hours of *geng*, *xin*, *shen*, or *you*, face northwest and throw one pellet to wither trees on the same day. Throw one pellet while performing the *Yu* step to kill tigers, wolves, snakes, and locusts instantly. Dissolve one pellet to write on stone, and the writing will penetrate its surface; on metal, it will sink into its texture, and no amount of scraping will remove it. For sudden death within a day, place one pellet in water corresponding to the lunar mansion and insert it into the throat, then have someone hold water in their mouth and spray it onto the deceased’s face to revive them. Coat one pellet with fox blood and crane blood, place it under the fingernail, and point at anything to transform it at will—mountains will move, trees will walk, and all will witness it, though the changes are real. All methods for making yellow and white *geng* yield immediate results. Guard this secret, guard it well.\n\n**Xuan Zhenzi’s Mercury-Fixation Method for Gold**\nTake one *jin* of realgar, one *jin* of mercury, four *liang* of chalcanthite, four *liang* of nitre, four *liang* of shallot, and three *sheng* of bitter wine. First, dry-fry the realgar, shallot, and bitter wine together until desiccated, then grind them to powder. Levigate with water to remove impurities, and grind the shallot with the mercury until fine and even. Take a fresh bamboo tube, first grind the chalcanthite and nitre together into powder, and place half of it inside the tube. Next, add the realgar, then cover it with the remaining nitre and chalcanthite. Then take two *liang* of bone ash and two *liang* of raw lacquer, mix them into pellets, and seal the mouth of the tube. Place the tube in a porcelain jar filled with several *sheng* of the aforementioned ingredients, submerge the tube, cover the jar’s mouth, and bury it in a shady spot three *chi* deep. After forty-nine days, retrieve it—it will have transformed into liquid. When using it, place half a *ge* of the liquid and one *jin* of mercury together in a crucible, and dry-fry over a gentle flame until fixed into *geng*. Use one *liang* of this *geng* to transmute ten *liang* of base metal into the finest purple-hued *geng*. Those who employ this method must guard it closely and never reveal it lightly.\n\n**The Scripture of the Dragon and Tiger on the Golden Elixir**\nThe esoteric secrets of the Dragon and Tiger, the true writ and wondrous formula. The Great Elixir of Dragon and Tiger originated after the Three Sovereigns, transmitted successively from master to disciple. From high antiquity, no written records existed—all was passed down orally, received in the heart. Only after the Five Emperors did the method begin to spread. Through the ages, countless adepts have attained the Dao. Even among perfected beings, scarcely one or two have received its oral transmission in full.\n\nMoreover, when Laozi expounded the *Five Thousand Characters*, and the Buddha unfolded the teachings of the Three Vehicles, they spoke only of the fundamental principle of perceiving one’s nature. Yet birth is followed by death, and though one may preserve that nature, cultivating an empty and luminous spirit, the body remains impermanent. How can this compare to the *Returned Elixir*, which grants immortality in life, an undying and unceasing existence, transforming the inner essence to achieve transcendence as a flying immortal? This is the true method of deliberate cultivation.\n\nThroughout the ages, countless Daoist immortals have attained the Way, yet none have spoken of the *Returned Elixir*. For this path is vast and profound, not to be lightly disclosed. Instead, they taught methods such as absorbing the light of the sun and moon to refine essence and circulate *qi*, contemplating the spirit and guarding the One, or the arts of sexual yoga to preserve essence. They also prescribed herbal medicines, minerals, metals, and the five metals and eight stones—practices that may briefly prolong life, setting one slightly apart from the common folk, but ultimately failing to open the path to eternal life. Should one encounter water or fire, blades or warfare, venomous creatures or fierce beasts, poison or misfortune, or harm from ghosts and spirits, the life force cannot escape the workings of the Five Phases. A thousand such dangers render these methods unreliable in the end.\n\nHave you not seen how the ancients ascended with their entire households? This was the power of the *Great Returned Elixir*—the most precious, revered, noble, wondrous, and mysterious of treasures. The term *returned* signifies a reversal, a homecoming; *elixir* denotes the color vermilion. It is the process of transmuting cinnabar to extract true mercury, then refining mercury with lead to produce the *Yellow Sprout*, which in turn reverts to cinnabar. When cinnabar is subdued by fire, it transforms into the *Returned Elixir*. This reversal bestows miraculous effects: the aged regain youth, the dead are revived, the withered flourish, and worthless stones are transmuted into supreme treasures. Is not its divine power vast indeed?\n\nThe *Great Returned Elixir* has three grades:\n- The **Upper Grade**: the *Ninefold Transmutation Golden Liquid Jade Essence Great Returned Elixir*, a celestial treasure not transmitted to the mortal world.\n- The **Middle Grade**: the *Dragon and Tiger Great Elixir*.\n- The **Lower Grade**: the *Eight-Stone Transmutation Mercury Ninefold Divine Elixir*.\n\nSince the Yellow Emperor refined the elixir and ascended, the *Dragon and Tiger Great Elixir* has been the most potent. With but a single *daogui* ingested, one secures longevity, dispels evil, and returns to the true. The Three Worms and Nine Parasites are eradicated, the *dantian* is fortified, and the spirit remains undispersed. The countless immortals of high antiquity all concealed the principles of the *Returned Elixir*. Though later texts on the elixir exist, they obscure the profound mysteries and lack the oral transmission. Those in later generations who sought the Way found no foothold, wasting their years in vain until old age.\n\nNow, I reveal this celestial secret, setting down the oral transmission in full for those of sincere aspiration. Those who would cultivate the Way of *xing* and *ming* need no longer hesitate or err.\n\n**Oral Transmission on the True Dragon and True Tiger**\nThe *True Dragon* is the mercury within cinnabar. It is born when the true *qi* of the sun’s radiance descends into the earth—this is called *mercury*. The *True Tiger* is the silver within black lead. It is born when the true *qi* of the moon’s essence descends into the earth—this is called *lead*. These two treasures are endowed with the true *qi* of the sun’s essence and the moon’s radiance: lead possesses *qi*, while mercury is formless. Among the seventy-two stones, none surpass lead and mercury in nobility—they alone can produce the *Dragon and Tiger Great Returned Elixir*.\n\nAs the scripture states: \"Living mercury can preserve the dead, while dead mercury can preserve the living.\" The proof is before your eyes, yet those who walk as mere corpses fail to pursue the Great Elixir. Such divine efficacy is bestowed only upon those with an immortal’s destiny, a legacy of ancestral blessing. Whoever encounters this method must guard it in utmost secrecy. Do not reveal it lightly, for to do so invites calamity upon oneself. Even to one’s closest kin, such as father and son, it must not be spoken. Only to a perfected being of shared heart and Dao may the oral transmission be entrusted.\n\n**End of Scroll One of *Divine-Grade Elixir Methods of Various Schools***\n**Beginning of Scroll Two of *Divine-Grade Elixir Methods of Various Schools***\n\n**Ritual for Selecting a Site for Elixir Refinement**\n*Recorded by Xuan Zhenzi Meng Yaofu*\n\n**Sealing the Furnace and Positioning the Crucible**\n**Ritual Incantations**\n\nFor the refinement of the Golden Elixir, one must first select a renowned mountain as the site, gathering three Dao-companions of shared heart and intent. The location should be near sweet-spring waters, and the year, month, day, and hour must be auspicious. Then, construct a chamber, seal the furnace, and position the crucible. The crucible should be made of earth from the wù and jǐ directions, fired with amber—this is the proper method.\n\nFor the central embryo’s union with the Child, amber is likewise used. The crucible must be neither too wide nor too narrow, its dimensions assessed in the moment to accommodate the central embryo’s union with the Child. It should allow for the free circulation of fire-qi in its revolutions—this is most sublime. If the crucible is too wide, Water and Fire will fail to harmonize; if too narrow, the qi of Water and Fire will not flow. Careful attention to detail is essential.\n\nThe furnace comprises six altars in three tiers, corresponding to the Three Powers. The crucible is placed atop the furnace, where Water and Fire achieve harmony. The furnace should be constructed to a height of one foot and two inches, with a width of one foot and six inches. The central chamber should measure one foot in diameter, with an outer thickness of three inches. At the front, a fire-door is opened, five inches in height and four inches in width, to admit the flame. At the rear, a solid passage shaped like a chimney is left to vent the fire-qi. When feeding the fire, utmost care must be taken to ensure its steadfast containment.\n\nOnce the furnace is installed and the crucible positioned, kindle the fire with offerings placed beside them. Reverently announce to the celestial and terrestrial deities: arrange three portions of wine and fruit to the north, with three incense altars. First, scatter incense and bow; then kneel deeply and whisper in secret:\n\n*\"On this day, month, and year, I, [name] of [place], undertake the firing of the elixir, seeking immortality. My vow is complete.\"*\n\nAgain address the deities, praying:\n\n*\"May the Great Dao and all Perfected Immortals witness my sincerity and swiftly perfect the golden and silver elixirs. Consuming them, may I attain longevity, ascend to the Nine Heavens, and share the lifespan of sun and moon.\"*\n\nThis disciple’s prayer is written in blue.\n\nThe rite concluded, consume the offerings yourself.\n\nBefore the separation of primal chaos, the Dao dwelt in profound obscurity. Once divided, a single qi arose—this is the True One. From the One came Two, from Two came Three, and from Three, the myriad things. Among all things, humans are the most spiritually endowed, thus forming the Three Powers with Heaven and Earth. Yet within the Three Powers, only human lifespans are finite: the long-lived may not reach a century, while the short-lived perish before their time. Reflecting in stillness, I could not but sigh in sorrow.\n\nIn my youth, I chanced upon alchemical classics and glimpsed their essence. The method of refining the Returned Elixir possesses wondrous efficacy—those who consume it attain longevity, their lives equaling Heaven and Earth. Thus, I pored over the texts again and again, pondering their meaning with delight. From that time onward, my heart yearned for immortality, dwelling upon it day and night, even in dreams. For over twenty years, I was fortunate to meet a Perfected One who transmitted the secrets of the medicines. Only then did I understand that lead and mercury are, in truth, one metal and one water, while the firing times employ one yin and one yang.\n\nYet I lament the swift passage of time, the days and months slipping by in procrastination. Failing to find a like-minded companion, I struggled alone in cultivation. Now, I record the true instructions I have received, alongside excerpts from the alchemical classics of the ancient sages, elucidating their meanings. This compilation is titled *The Secret Essentials of the Golden Elixir, Aligned with the Three Powers*. I present the matter directly, without embellishment. Though some verses may repeat or the language seem coarse, my aim is to convey the principle, not refine the prose.\n\nThe Way of the Returned Elixir is profoundly mysterious and abstruse. Thus, despite my humble and unpolished nature, I set these words in order. Should there be those of shared aspiration, I pray they may peruse them with favor.\n\nI have heard that the tradition of the Returned Elixir traces back to the Three Sovereigns. The Three Sovereigns bequeathed their model, and the Five Emperors succeeded one another, passing down the teachings through the ages, transmitted from the benevolent to the worthy. In the era of the Three Sovereigns, the arts of immortality were taught first, and the throne was abdicated afterward. After the Five Emperors, the Way declined and scattered among recluses in the mountains and forests. Thus, many immortals have emerged across the dynasties, each leaving behind teachings and alchemical classics, thousands of scrolls circulating in the world. All are profoundly subtle, yet few grasp their ultimate import. Though the Way of the Returned Elixir is known to exist, those who comprehend it are rare.\n\nThis method embodies the vast emptiness of the Great Dao, resonating with the Three Powers and the workings of Heaven and Earth. It seizes the creative power of the cosmos and steals the generative functions of the four seasons. Therefore, those who refine the elixir must first master celestial patterns, then understand terrestrial principles, penetrate the mysteries of yin and yang, and fathom the permutations of the hexagrams. They must also regulate the cyclical days of the waxing and waning phases, the ascent and descent of the firing times, and the methods of advancing and retreating the crucible and furnace. Only then can they enter the gate of the Dragon and Tiger’s symbolic resonance, recognize the subtleties of true lead and mercury, and—combining inner clarity of virtue with outer acts of compassion—unite their heart with the elixir and attain true yang.\n\nThe art of the Returned Elixir is achieved through karmic affinity; it cannot be grasped in a single morning or evening, nor by merely clutching scrolls and parsing texts. One must personally encounter a Perfected One and receive their secret oral transmission—without this, the profound essence of the Returned Elixir remains unknowable.\n\nSome recklessly interpret the classics, mistaking common lead for true lead or ordinary mercury for true mercury. They speculate on yin and yang, guess at firing times, and blindly cultivate without guidance, entrusting their fate to heaven. In refining lead and mercury, the firing times come first, followed by the yin-yang furnace and crucible.\n\nTo illustrate the Returned Elixir: in the eleventh month, when the first yang stirs, apply fire for five days per phase. The fire begins with the hexagram *Fu* (Return) and concludes with *Kun* (Receptive), naturally harmonizing yin and yang without error in the qi phases. Lead and mercury follow their own principles, relying on the firing times, which are governed by the *Book of Changes*. If the firing deviates from the qi phases, even with true lead and mercury, the elixir will not form. How can untimely actions yield timely results? Like the sun and moon shining constantly, the blind cannot see—not due to any fault of the luminaries, but because the cultivator acts in haste.\n\nWhen using lead and mercury for the elixir, many err by taking black lead as true lead or mistaking cinnabar-derived mercury for true mercury. Some extract lead yellow as the \"yellow sprout,\" or refine saltpeter, distill mercury, or use cinnabar, lead ashes, litharge, the two greens, three yellows, five metals, and eight minerals. All such substances, being material, are not the ultimate method. As the Perfected Lord Yin said: *\"Material things cannot serve as companions; forced refinement harms the practitioner.\"* Those who study the elixir must be cautious.\n\nThe two substances, lead and mercury, are thoroughly concealed in the alchemical classics. Without direct explanation, their nature remains obscure. Lead is silver—true lead is the sacred silver derived from lead, born of the moon’s essence and the water essence of Great Yin. If one can refine and subdue it into an elixir, how could it not grant longevity? True lead is definitively silver, without doubt or error. As Master Azure Radiance said:\n\n*\"The yellow sprout is not lead—\nSeek it within lead.\nTo recognize the yellow sprout,\nLook to what lies within lead.\"*\n\nMercury is quicksilver, obtained from cinnabar. Though it has form, it lacks substance. It absorbs silver’s blackness and solidifies, hence it is called true mercury.\n\nIt is born of the sun’s essence and assumes blackness—this is the true fire of Great Yang. If one can refine and subdue it into an elixir, how could it not secure one’s destiny? True mercury must be quicksilver, without alternative.\n\n*The Dragon-Tiger Essential Instructions* states:\n*\"Living quicksilver can preserve the dead,\nDead quicksilver can preserve the living.\"*\n\nLead and mercury are the most sagely of heaven and earth, the numinous qi of sun and moon. In symbolic correspondence, they are called Dragon and Tiger. Among all the myriad things, only lead and mercury can produce the Reverted Elixir; all else is not the proper method.\n\nLead possesses qi but lacks inherent form. Mercury, by contrast, has no original shape. Lead is yang within and yin without, thus serving as the ground for the elixir. Borrowing its qi, the Yellow Sprout arises—clearly, when one attains its true qi, the numinous sprout naturally emerges, and thus true lead may be set aside.\n\nMaster Azure Radiance said:\n*\"Lead is the mother of the sprout,\nThe sprout is the child of lead.\nOnce the Golden Flower is attained,\nLead is set aside and not employed.\"*\n\nMercury, originally formless, resembles qi in its state. Its nature is wholly yang, yet its form is wholly yin. Placing a hundred *hu* of it into a cauldron and refining it to dryness reveals its original substance. When sown into lead, it absorbs lead’s essential qi and transforms its quality—this is called the Yellow Sprout. Is this not the emergence of substance from the formless?\n\nLord Yin the True said:\n*\"From formless substance, substance is born—this is the Reverted Elixir.\"*\n\nThe Yellow Sprout is the foundation of the Great Elixir. *The Record of the Supreme Change* states:\n*\"Without the Yellow Sprout’s wonder,\nThe Reverted Elixir’s path remains distant.\"*\n\nIn preparing the Yellow Sprout, one must seize the height of its vigor, with the White Dew as the starting point. At this time, the metal’s color is perfectly luminous, the toad’s light full and abundant—this is the season for refining the elixir.\n\nMaster Xu the True said:\n*\"In the eighth month, refine the head;\nIn winter, nurture the child.\"*\n\nBeginning in the first days of the eighth month, one employs the Nine Cauldrons to obtain the Yellow Sprout. By the tenth month, all depends on the balance of water and fire, the harmony of yin and yang, so that the numinous sprout naturally emerges. If water and fire are not balanced, the lead’s base will be overrun, and the numinous sprout will be infiltrated, rendering it unusable—like the eye, which cannot tolerate even the slightest mote.\n\nEight ounces of Yellow Sprout form the upper crescent; eight ounces of mercury form the lower crescent. Together, the two crescents unite to make one *jin*. Each *jin* is sixteen ounces, each ounce twenty-four *zhu*, so one *jin* totals three hundred eighty-four *zhu*, corresponding to the number of hexagrams.\n\nFor the upper crescent of eight ounces, one must regulate the fire-phase to steal sufficient lead-blackness before it is fit for use.\n\nMaster Li the True said:\n*\"The lower crescent must rely on the upper’s fulfillment.\"*\nFor the Yellow Sprout is the foundation of the elixir. If it does not receive enough blackness, the elixir will not be subdued.\n\nMaster Azure Radiance said:\n*\"The medicine in the crucible\nIs like a hen brooding her eggs,\nLike a child in the womb,\nLike fruit on the tree.\nOnly when it has received enough blackness\nWill it naturally ripen.\"*\n\nOnce the medicine enters the central womb, it must be sealed tightly to prevent the leakage of true blackness. It is also said:\n*\"Seal the womb without leakage—\nTransformation occurs in an instant.\"*\n\nThe form of the central womb is round, like heaven and earth before their separation, blended as an egg’s roundness, rising and falling like Penglai. Its openings are minutely sealed, with spirit circulating within. When the medicine enters the central womb and one prepares to refine it, one must first select the ground.\n\nChoose only a site of blessed virtue, where the year and month are auspicious, a place of purity, seclusion, and tranquility. Ancient temples, tombs, abandoned wells, ruined kilns, battlefields, or sites defiled by women’s childbirth—none of these are suitable for refinement.\n\nLord Yin the True said:\n*\"Without the proper ground, do not act rashly.\nOne must obtain the ground and then seek the Elixir Well.\"*\n\nThe well is the most urgent necessity for refining the elixir. Day and night, water and fire are drawn and replenished, and the well’s dripping is essential. Since ancient times, immortals who ascended to transcendence all left their elixir wells behind, demonstrating the well’s critical role in elixir refinement.\n\nOnce the elixir well is established, do not allow it to be defiled. After the water’s pulse stabilizes, it must be dredged and replaced to clear stagnant springs. Then, expose it to the open sky so that the stars and moon may shine upon it. Once the water’s nature is settled and the earth’s blackness is gathered, it may be drawn for elixir refinement.\n\nIf the water is clear and white with a sweet taste, issuing from a stony base, it is yang-pulse water—most efficacious for elixir refinement. If it flows through black mud or yellow earth, or if the spring is red and iron-tinged with a bitter, astringent taste, such signs indicate mixed water pulses, yin and yang stagnation, and it is unfit for elixir refinement. One must construct another.\n\nMaster Le the True said:\n*\"First select an auspicious site,\nThen establish the well and altar.\nAvoid all defilement,\nAnd shun foul odors.\"*\n\nHaving obtained the elixir ground and elixir well, one must next prepare the crucible and vessel. For the Reverted Elixir cannot be completed without them.\n\n*The Scripture of Primordial Chaos* states:\n*\"Kan and Li are the medicine;\nQian and Kun are the crucible.\nWhen the four embrace one another,\nIt is called the Sacred Key.\"*\n\nQian is metal; Kun is earth. Earth gives birth to metal, hence it is called the Metal Crucible—not that metal is used as the crucible. The crucible is the chamber of the elixir. When the crucible is complete, the myriad things are born within it. The crucible corresponds to the Central Palace, and the Central Palace belongs to earth, which gives birth to the myriad things—thus the crucible is made of earth.\n\nLord Yin the True said:\n*\"One must seek the crucible in the Central Palace.\"*\nClearly, this means using common earth to fire porcelain for the crucible.\n\nAs for the porcelain used in the central womb, its length and width are determined at the time of fabrication. The ancients did not record measurements, and later accounts vary—how could one rigidly adhere to them? If it is too wide, the qi of water and fire will not converge; if too narrow, the qi of water and fire will not circulate. One must consider this carefully.\n\nHaving obtained the crucible, one must then construct the furnace, for the furnace is the enclosure of the crucible. Without the furnace, the crucible is like a person without a dwelling—how can one reside without city walls? Thus, the furnace is placed at a distance from the crucible to contain the fire’s qi.\n\nThe furnace’s base has a platform, three tiers high, octagonal in shape, with eight gates. Above the gates are partitions, and upon these the crucible is placed. Water rests above the crucible, and the medicine below.\n\nThe water crucible has an open mouth to receive the water, covered with a lid. Its height is two chi and one cun, its width one chi and six cun, with a central opening one chi and three cun wide and three cun thick. At the front is a fire gate, five cun high and four cun wide. At the rear is an aperture to vent the fire’s qi, resembling the chimney of a stove. Yet the ancient sages each left different models—those who refine the elixir must examine them carefully.\n\nOnce the yellow sprout has entered the womb, the womb is placed in the crucible, and the crucible in the furnace, layer upon layer, sealed tightly to prevent the true qi from leaking. Before introducing water and fire, one must first regulate the water clock, ensuring it flows from dawn to dusk without pause. The cycles of yin and yang are measured by the clock; if the clock errs, the balance of water and fire will be lost—thus, everything depends on the water clock. I have seen later students of the elixir neglect the water clock, which is deeply mistaken. The efficacy of the returned elixir is profoundly wondrous: when a person consumes it, they become an immortal; when a dog eats it, it turns into a dragon; when a chicken feeds on it, it transforms into a phoenix. This is because it seizes the creative power of Heaven and Earth, yielding such miraculous results. Without the water clock, how can yin and yang be regulated? As Baixuanzi said: *\"Entering the crucible without relying on the clock, without the clock the elixir will not form—like a blind man discarding his staff, or a deaf man strumming a lute.\"*\n\nOnce the water clock is precise and the furnace and crucible are complete, the sprout enters the womb, and one awaits the rise of the first yang line to begin the circulation of water and fire. In refining the elixir, nothing is more difficult than the *huohou* (fire timing). The *huohou* is the great secret of the Orthodox Unity tradition. If a cultivator masters the true *huohou*, how could they fail to produce the returned elixir? If the *huohou* is incomplete, how can the work proceed? The myriad scrolls of elixir scriptures conceal their essence in the *huohou*. The original method takes one year, though the ancient immortals concealed the supreme technique, claiming it required three, nine, or even twelve years—leaving later students at a loss. The claim that one year yields a minor return, two years a middle return, and three years a great return is merely a decorative explanation of the elixir’s stages, altering the principle; in truth, three years are not required.\n\nFrom *zi* to *hai* is one year; from *mao* to *you*, two years; from *zi* to *shen*, three years—three threes making nine, the yang number. As Qingxiazi said: *\"From *zi* to *shen* is called the Nine Returns\"*—this is the principle. From *you* to *hai* is the retreat of yang into the yin position. Elixirists do not calculate it thus, hence they speak of three years. The \"nine years\" refers to the nine months from *zi* to *shen*, with each month counted as a year—this is also a reduction of the yang number, embodying the meaning of the Nine Returns. Thus, it is called nine years. The \"twelve years\" refers to the complete ascent and descent of yin and yang over a full year, exhausting one cycle—hence twelve years. Using one month as a year makes it clear that one *shi* (two-hour period) is taken as one month. One day has twelve *shi*, one month totals 360 *shi*, corresponding to 360 days, with one month as one year. This is how the ancient sages confused later generations, guarding the supreme method; in truth, the method requires only one year.\n\nAs Qingxiazi said: *\"I have never heard of a woman carrying a child for two or three years before giving birth.\"* The *huohou* of one year consists of twelve months, with five days as one *hou* (period) and forty-five days as one *jie* (node). The ancients used the *Book of Changes* as a model: its sixty-four hexagrams take *Qian* and *Kun* as the crucible, *Kan* and *Li* as the medicine, and four hexagrams as the furnace’s mechanism, while the remaining sixty serve as the numbers for circulating fire. The process begins with *Zhun* and *Meng* and ends with *Weiji*. Each day uses two hexagrams—thirty days in a month, totaling sixty hexagrams, cycling endlessly. *Zhun* at dawn, *Meng* at dusk, ten months to gestate the medicine, two months to nurture it, like a mother nursing her child—only after ten months is it fully mature.\n\nThe fire begins on the first day of the eleventh month, and after sixty days, the black medicine coalesces in the womb. In the first month, the *jiedu* hexagram fire is applied. From *yin* to *shen* is called the Seven Returns; from *zi* to *shen*, the Nine Returns. Fire flourishes at *wu*, is interred at *xu*, and the work concludes at *hai*. The fire begins with the first yang at *fu* in the eleventh month, followed by *lin* in the twelfth month, *tai* in the first month, *dazhuang* in the second, *guai* in the third, *qian* in the fourth, *gou* in the fifth, *dun* in the sixth, *pi* in the seventh, *guan* in the eighth, *bo* in the ninth, and *kun* in the tenth—refining the medicine into the elixir, completing the work in one year. This is the general outline.\n\nFor those who wish to refine the elixir, first prepare all implements, tools, furnace, crucible, water, and fire in the medicine chamber after the middle of the tenth month. On the day before the Great Snow, gently heat the stove, awaiting the arrival of the *zhifu* to report the time. At the first yang line’s birth at the *zi* hour on the Great Snow’s eleventh-month node, introduce water and fire, advancing and retreating with the six lines, each line occupying ten *shi*. Maintain the original starting point, cycling two hexagrams per day—these are the daily hexagrams. Follow the hexagram images in sequence, with fifteen days as one *qi*. Before each *qi*, set aside two and a half days, totaling thirty *shi*. The *mao* and *you* gates of the second and eighth months are called the \"dead *qi*\"—a great taboo for elixirists, during which water and fire are not introduced. Over twelve months, there are twenty-four *qi*, but excluding twenty-four instances of one and a half days (totaling sixty days, exactly two months), only ten months remain for the actual circulation of water and fire. Thus, it is clear that the returned elixir gestates for ten months before emerging, like a human fetus born after ten months in the womb. This principle is profound and mysterious, known only to the divine and sagely—truly wondrous.\n\nBefore each *qi*, for two and a half days at *mao*, temporarily halt the water and fire, and do not open the crucible.\n\nFor the latter two and a half days of each *qi* at *you*, first halt the water and fire, then open the crucible. Retrieve the elixir for its \"bathing\"—grind it three thousand times to the left, which is called the \"bathing.\" The opening and closing of the crucible must be utterly secure. The advance and retreat of water and fire must not be too slow or too swift. Rely solely on the water clock, lest the timing be amiss. In operating water and fire, though the clepsydra marks the hours, even if night falls, one must gaze upward to observe where the Dipper’s handle points and where the sun and moon rise and set—this is how to measure the timing, ensuring the union of yin and yang is precise.\n\nIn refining the returned elixir, three practitioners of pure emptiness must join in shared resolve, vowing together that the returned elixir be perfected. Before beginning, they must fast, bathe, and offer prayers to the heavens. One tends the water clock, one adjusts the crucible and alternates water and fire, and one manages the balance of yin and yang, shifting the hexagrams and advancing or retreating water and fire according to the timing. The duties of the three must not err by even a hair’s breadth.\n\nThe Perfected One says: Through the night, all three must guard and pray with utmost reverence. Though each attends to their urgent tasks, they must take turns resting during the night watches. For the work continues day and night without pause, and the passage of time is long—lest the elixirists grow weary and err in their refinement. Within the elixir chamber, incense must burn ceaselessly, offerings made to the Highest Perfected. Apart from two vegetarian meals, all must be strictly observed.\n\nIf water and fire do not err and yin and yang are precisely balanced, the divine embryo within the crucible will transform of itself. From the eleventh month onward, until the fourth month, which belongs to yang, the crucible turns left. From the fifth to the tenth month, which belong to yin, the crucible turns right. When the elixir reaches its utmost flourishing, one must not for a moment abandon the elixir chamber—listen only for the dragon’s roar at the height of its power. Beyond this peak of yang, the elixir has no cause for concern. Gradually reduce the fire, continuing until the tenth month, when pure yang returns to *kun*, and the returned elixir is ripe. Its color shifts to purple-red, its radiance blazing—nine cycles of yang complete, the Five Phases fully realized. From the Son of Heaven to the common folk, even birds and beasts, all who consume it attain longevity. Withered trees regain their bloom, dry bones grow flesh anew. It transmutes tiles and pebbles into gold—its divine power and transformations are unfathomable.\n\nWhenever I read the *Five Thousand Words* of *Laozi* or the *Inner and Outer Radiance of the Yellow Court*, they speak of the principle of primal *qi*, illuminating only the nature while lamenting the existence of form. Form is the dwelling of nature—if there were no form, where would nature reside? I say that the primal gives birth to the existent, and the existent gives birth to form. Since this cause exists, why not secure it? Yet practicing the Way of primal *qi* only revives one after death—how can it compare to the art of the returned elixir, which prevents death in life? For the returned elixir is the true method of deliberate action. If one cultivates it with utmost sincerity, once the elixir is achieved, one attains sagehood and spiritual communion. A single *daogui* ingested fortifies the form forever, one’s name inscribed in the Jade Register, one’s place secured among the immortals—none in the Mysterious Teachings can compare. Though I am but a dust-bound scholar of humble talent, unworthy of this sacred transmission, I dare record these divine secrets. If there are lofty adepts beyond the mundane, those who share this aspiration, I invite them to ponder these words carefully.\n\n**Lü Dongbin’s Method for the Nine-Cycled Golden Elixir of Longevity**\n\nTake eight ounces of the finest yellow *geng* from the West, ground into powder. Then take eight ounces of mercury, and combine the two substances in an iron mortar, pounding for one *shi* (two hours). Naturally, a golden cinnabar sand forms, from which a dark, murky water—impure *qi* from the wood essence—is washed out. This water must be changed repeatedly until the sand is clean. Then take the sand and wrap it tightly in a clean, boiled white silk cloth, roughly the size of a ball, ensuring it is firm. Boil it with alum and vinegar until it becomes a bright, clear blue-green.\n\nGrind one ounce of chalcanthite into powder, mix it with five *sheng* of good vinegar in a pot, and heat until the vinegar boils. Suspend the sand ball within and boil it. If the vinegar evaporates, add more. Boil with warm vinegar for one *fu* (twelve hours) until done. During boiling, the fire must be gentle, allowing only a slight simmer. Once boiled, the sand will naturally harden like iron or stone. The vinegar used to boil the sand and alum is not a harmful substance—it is a wondrous secret for firming the sand.\n\nNext, use *liuyi* clay to seal it. **Method for Making Liuyi Clay**: Take four ounces of the essence of true earth, heat it in charcoal fire until red, then soak it in vinegar until saturated. Also take one ounce each of red halloysite, white halloysite, earthworm soil, cinnabar-coated gold earth, and six other ingredients, along with one *jin* of sweet earth. Combine all seven substances, pound them into powder, and mix with saltwater and a small amount of paper fiber to form a stiff clay. Use this to seal the sand ball tightly, ensuring no cracks or fissures. If any blackened areas appear, patch them with clay to make it utterly firm and complete.\n\nThe sand ball, resembling a sphere, is called the \"elixir embryo\" or the \"divine chamber.\" The essence of true earth is the central *qi* of the center, while the other six ingredients serve as assistants. When the elixir embryo is fired, the lead and mercury within are securely bound, allowing for wondrous transformations through separation.\n\nOnce sealed, take an iron container capable of holding about two *sheng* of material. Fill it with refined lead essence, fully occupying the container. Place the elixir embryo at the center of the lead essence, ensuring it is perfectly centered without tilting. One must be meticulous and single-minded, packing it tightly and filling the container completely. Seal the lid with *liuyi* clay, ensuring no *qi* escapes.\n\nOnce the container is sealed, further apply finely sifted clay from fired tiles, mixed with pure paper fiber and scented water, to form a sealing layer about one *cun* thick. Allow it to dry, ensuring no cracks appear; if any are found, repair them until it is utterly firm and complete.\n\nNext, prepare a movable firing furnace and crucible made of iron, resembling an ordinary cooking pot. It should hold approximately one *dou* and eight *sheng*. Alternatively, use a clay crucible, sealing it with mud while leaving one fire-entry port. Fill the crucible with charcoal. Place the sealed elixir container at its center, ensuring it is perfectly centered without tilting, and pack it tightly with charcoal to full capacity. Once the mud is dry, choose the first day of a *liu-jia* cycle. Three days prior, offer incense, lamps, wine, vegetables, gold coins, and paper horses to the furnace deity. At dawn (*mao* hour), take one *jin* of thoroughly ignited charcoal, crush it, and place it evenly at the bottom of the crucible. Cover it lightly with warm ash, leaving one or two parts of fire exposed to gently heat the crucible and nurture the elixir embryo. By dusk (*you* hour), follow the same procedure as at dawn, adding another *jin* of fire. Throughout the twelve hours of day and night, the fire must never be allowed to extinguish. After nurturing it for forty-nine days—exactly seven times seven—the elixir will form into \"mother-and-child gold,\" also called the \"Water-Wood-Fire Elixir Head.\" This is the first transformation of the returning elixir, known as the \"Dragon-Tiger Supreme Treasure.\"\n\nMetal conquers Wood, causing mercury to immediately solidify into cinnabar grains. Wood conquers Earth, ensuring the *liuyi* clay remains firm and does not contaminate the elixir’s body. Earth conquers Water, which is its proper function. Water conquers Fire, preventing mercury from escaping. The five phases restrain one another, giving rise to the numinous essence of Metal and Wood. The five phases generate one another, allowing the returning elixir to solidify. The wise will ponder this—none shall err.\n\nFor the first transformation, once the firing period is complete, allow the crucible to cool, then open it and remove the elixir powder, grinding it into fine dust. Add only eight *liang* of Wood essence (water). Following the first transformation’s procedure, pound it finely, wash and boil it, then prepare *liuyi* clay to seal it. Place it back into the furnace and nurture it with fire for another forty-nine days to complete the cycle, yielding what is called the \"Divine Elixir.\"\n\nBy the fourth transformation, after forty-nine days of nurturing, open the crucible to retrieve the elixir powder, which will have formed into fine cinnabar grains—this is the completion of the Fourfold Divine Elixir. No longer is there need for the lead container or lead essence. Instead, use a small iron container, leaving two parts of its center empty to hold the Fourfold Divine Elixir powder. Take one *jin* of high-grade cinnabar, selecting eight *liang* of the largest pieces. Divide the eight *liang* of Fourfold Divine Elixir powder into the container, spreading it evenly. Arrange the cinnabar like lotus roots, then cover it with another eight *liang* of elixir powder. Layer three *liang* of cinnabar again, followed by another eight *liang* of elixir powder. Repeat this layering: five layers of elixir and four layers of cinnabar, totaling forty *liang* of elixir and twelve *liang* of cinnabar. Once arranged, ensure it is tightly packed. Seal the container’s seams with *liuyi* clay, then apply an additional layer of salt-paper mud one *cun* thick to the exterior. Allow it to dry, then place it in the movable firing crucible, centered in the ash without tilting. Seal the crucible’s seams with salt mud. Once dry, follow the first transformation’s procedure, adding fire for forty-nine days to complete the process. Upon opening the crucible, the pure cinnabar will appear purple—this is called the \"Sacred Golden Sprout\" or the \"Transcendent Embryo Sacred Quartz.\"\n\nSelect the cinnabar and place the Fourfold Divine Elixir powder into a *qi* furnace, smelting it into a molten state. Pour it into a mold to form a gold container resembling two halves of a chicken egg. Then take two *liang* of raw cinnabar and eight *liang* of the nurtured cinnabar, grinding them together into fine powder. Place this into the container, sealing the seams with *liuyi* clay to prevent *qi* leakage. Apply another layer of *liuyi* clay one *cun* thick to the exterior. Allow it to dry, then place it in the movable firing crucible, centered in the ash without tilting. Seal the crucible’s seams with salt mud. Once dry, choose the first day of a *liu-jia* cycle. At dawn (*mao* hour), take one *jin* of thoroughly ignited fire, crush it, and place it evenly at the bottom of the crucible. Cover it lightly with warm ash, leaving two or three parts of fire exposed. At noon (*wu* hour), follow the same procedure as at dawn, adding another *jin* of fire. Repeat this at dusk (*you* hour) and midnight (*zi* hour), adding fire only during the four hours of *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you*. During the remaining eight hours (*chen*, *si*, etc.), brush away the ash from the fire, leaving only two or three parts of ash to allow the fire’s *qi* to gently heat the crucible. After forty-nine days, it will be complete, known as the \"Beautiful Gold Flower.\"\n\nUpon opening the crucible, add two *liang* of raw cinnabar, grinding it together with the previous mixture into fine powder. Place it back into the container and, following the first transformation’s procedure, seal and fire it for another forty-nine days to complete the cycle, yielding the \"Numinous Gold Frost.\" Remove it, then add two *liang* of cinnabar, grinding it together into fine powder. Place it back into the container and, following the same procedure, nurture it with fire for forty-nine days to complete the cycle, producing the \"Returning Soul Sacred Gold Liquid.\" Open it, add another two *liang* of raw cinnabar, grind it finely, and place it into the container. After completing the nine transformations, choose an auspicious day and hour. At noon, open the container beneath the sun, allowing its light to illuminate the cinnabar’s mother-and-child body.\n\nMake thirty pills from each *liang*. Offer them to the deities of heaven and earth, mountains and rivers, markets and wells, dragons and spirits, and the sages of the Three Realms. Once the offerings are complete, take four *liang* of mercury, one *sheng* of purified water, and one pill of the elixir, placing them into a new, clean iron crucible. Cover it with a clean vessel and set it over a charcoal fire, boiling until the water evaporates and the mercury dries, yielding \"Male Stone of Superior Fire.\" Melt one *jin* of silver, copper, iron, or tin in a furnace, then add one pill of the elixir, stirring until even. Pour it out to form an ingot, which will also become \"Male Stone of Superior Fire.\" If used for transmutation, it will not release fire-toxin. If consumed, it must first be detoxified. Seal it in a container and let it rest for one *fu*-period to dispel yin-toxin, then bury it three *chi* or one *zhang* underground, or suspend it in a well. Alternatively, expose it to sunlight for refinement.\n\nTo refine the Yellow Sprout: Take five *liang* of authentic native silver from mountains and marshes, hammer it into a disc shaped like the sun, and pound it a thousand times with an iron hammer to compact it thoroughly, preventing mercury from seeping into the Yellow Sprout. Place three *liang* of mercury in an amber vessel, then set the silver disc inside, leaving two *cun* of space above the mercury, ensuring it is level and properly positioned. Seal all seams with Six-One Mud. Place a water-filled vessel above to cover the amber vessel’s mouth, then invert it downward. Nurture it with three *liang* of charcoal fire continuously for seven days and nights. Upon opening, the mercury and silver will produce Yellow Sprouts like needles, all of which are white silver—this is the \"First Transformation Yellow Sprout.\" Add another three *liang* of mercury and nurture it for seven days and nights; upon opening, it will resemble the color of malt. Add another three *liang* of mercury and nurture it for seven days; upon opening, its color will deepen to yellow. Do not collect it yet—let it grow gradually, like wheat seedlings. After seven days, open the furnace and add three *liang* of mercury. By the completion of forty-nine days (seven cycles), a total of twenty-one *liang* of mercury will have been added, yielding the \"Purple Gold Yellow Sprout.\" Each transformation in the furnace produces different forms and colors. This Yellow Sprout is called the \"Mother of the Returning Elixir.\" The mercury remaining in the vessel will turn red like cinnabar, yielding two or three *liang*—this is called \"Child Longing for Mother\" or \"Single-Bodied Cinnabar.\" This medicine can be mixed with cow’s milk, steamed, ground into powder, and formed into pills with jujube pulp. Take three pills daily on an empty stomach with wine to replenish the lower *dantian*, calm the heart, stabilize the hun and po souls, and treat various wind-cold ailments. Its benefits are too numerous to list. The Yellow Sprouts growing on the surface can yield over twelve *liang*. The stubborn mercury beneath the silver disc, amounting to three or four *liang* that remains untransformed, is blackened due to excessive exposure—store it separately, as it has its own medicinal uses. The mercury Yellow Sprout can serve as the \"Mother of the Elixir,\" also called the \"Mother of the Returning Elixir.\" Cinnabar is the \"solar essence,\" while the mercury Yellow Sprout is the \"lunar spirit.\"\n\nA song says:\nThe sage seizes the mechanism of creation,\nHand-gathering sun and moon to place in the crucible and tripod.\n\nTo refine the Elixir: Take five *liang* of bright, fiery cinnabar lumps, mix them with three *sheng* of fine vinegar, and place them together in an iron cauldron. Suspend a cloth-wrapped \"embryo\" inside and boil for seven days and nights without extinguishing the fire. If the vinegar dries, replenish it. Once the vinegar is exhausted, remove the cinnabar, wash it clean with hot water, and wrap it in gold foil. Grind ink and apply it to the cinnabar, layering it to a thickness of half a *fen*, ensuring meticulous coating, then dry it over a gentle fire. Take five *liang* of fine gold and hammer it into a container capable of holding fifteen *liang* of material, ensuring it is neither damaged nor too thin. Grind fine ink into powder, mix it with egg white, and apply a half-*mi* thick layer inside the container. Then take *qingdai*, realgar, hematite, and chalcanthite, each one *fen*, grind them with vinegar into a paste, and coat the inside of the container. Next, grind the Yellow Sprout into powder, pack it tightly into the container, leaving one small opening. Place the cinnabar-wrapped \"embryo\" inside, like a mother nurturing a child, ensuring it remains undisturbed until the month is full and the elixir is born—no deviations allowed. Cover it entirely with Yellow Sprout powder, seal it with the container’s lid, and bind it tightly with hemp fiber to prevent movement. First, place it in warm ashes to dispel its yin-qi. Take one *jin* of refined saltpeter and four *liang* of saltpeter, melt them together in a crucible, then cool and grind into fine powder. Take ten *liang* of fine silver and hammer it into a large container capable of holding thirty *liang* of medicine. First, pack half of the saltpeter-salt mixture tightly into the silver container, then place the gold container at its center. Cover it with the remaining saltpeter-salt mixture, filling and packing it tightly. Bind it with hemp fiber, seal it completely with Six-One Mud to a thickness of one *cun*, and dry it thoroughly over a gentle fire. Dig a pit to form a furnace, fill it with ashes to create a basin, place the container inside, and cover its top with ashes. First, apply two *liang* of fire and nurture it for seven days. Then apply four *liang* of fire, ensuring it does not touch dead ashes.\n\nBy the sixtieth day, apply six *liang* of fire and cease, then nurture it until the eighty-first day when the medicine is complete. Do not allow others to witness this, lest they disrupt the process. Next, remove the crucible and container, place them in a shallow furnace, and apply five *jin* of fire to heat them until glowing red, then stop. First, burn incense and make an invocation, then open the container. The medicine remains undamaged in its embryonic state, radiant, fragrant, and immaculate—beyond imagination. As if untouched by even gentle fire, this is called *sǎn*-processed elixir.\n\nTake a piece of cinnabar and place it in an iron pan, heating it over fire until it becomes like still oil, its brilliance indescribable. Then place mercury in a crucible, sprinkle it with powdered cinnabar, and the mercury will instantly dry into silver. If you place powdered cinnabar in a small bamboo tube and nestle it in warm ashes, heating it for a long while, it will also dry into silver, though slightly yellowed and not yet suitable for ingestion.\n\nNext, take fire-tamed cinnabar, remove its black impurities, and refine it all at once—the medicine will not diminish. Also, take five *liang* of realgar, the finest and most lustrous, free of impurities and resembling arrowheads. Seal it tightly. For cinnabar, use a piece of gold leaf, coat it with fine ink, mix it with the cinnabar, and nurture it for twenty-one days. Keep it in an ash basin with four *liang* of fire, cover it with *huangya*, seal it properly, and when the days are complete, remove it from the crucible. Place it in a shallow furnace, apply five *jin* of fire to heat it until glowing red, then withdraw the fire. Once cooled and opened, the realgar will appear like purple gold.\n\nTake a piece of realgar, grind it finely, and sprinkle it over one *liang* of mercury in a small pan. Apply three *liang* of fire, and the two substances will instantly dry, transforming into purple gold. If you wish to transmute silver, *yuyu*, *shimao*, or *danyang*, apply fire atop male stone—its potency is beyond measure.\n\nFor fire-tamed cinnabar (five *liang*), select an auspicious day for extraction and use it for ingestion. Grind it into powder, mix with jujube pulp to form pills—one *liang* of cinnabar makes one thousand pills. Begin consumption on a *jiazi* day, abstaining from meat and strictly avoiding sexual activity. First, perform hidden virtues for three years, make offerings to heaven and earth, and vow to cultivate compassion before ingesting. Regularly swallow saliva twenty-four times before taking three pills.\n\nBefore grinding the fire-tamed cinnabar, first take two *liang* of *yuganzi* and a handful of *hanfangji* and sweet bamboo, finely chop them, place them in the crucible, and boil with the cinnabar for one *fu* period. Remove and place in a double-layered silk bag, suspend it in a well or soak it in well water for seven days, then steam it with cow’s milk for the duration of one cooking. Only when the fire-toxin is fully expelled may it be formed into pills.\n\nTo instantly dry one *liang* of mercury into treasure, follow this method. For ingestion, consume only one spring each year, from the *jiazi* day for sixty days, taking three pills daily—totaling one hundred eighty pills. All illnesses will be dispelled in a year. With continued use, its effects are beyond description. If you wish to abstain from grains, drink a little cold water each morning. Once you obtain this elixir, even in midsummer, place a piece of raw meat with one pill atop it, and after a month, it will not spoil, its blood turning fresh and red. If dead flesh fares thus, how much more will a living person benefit, prolonging life?\n\nFire-tamed realgar, after a year, may be formed into pills with jujube pulp. Take one pill on an empty stomach with wine to cure all wind-cold and qi ailments—one pill suffices for permanent relief. If not for ingestion, place powdered realgar in a pan, insert a copper rod to create an opening, nestle it in an ash basin, wrap mercury in its surface, and nurture it with gentle fire for one *fu* period. The resulting yellow gold will be luminous, pure, and indescribably exquisite—also called *Zijin Heche* (\"Purple Gold River Chariot\"). *He* means \"to ferry across,\" and *che* means \"to bear,\" hence *Heche*. Its merits are beyond description. If intended for ingestion, expel the fire-toxin before consuming.\n\nCinnabar is called *Yinguzi* (\"Silver Valley Seed\"), and realgar is called *Jinguzi* (\"Gold Valley Seed\"). First refine *huangya* to produce *yongquan*. Take ten *liang* of *yongquan* and mix it with ten *liang* of raw mercury, grinding briefly until it forms cinnabar grains. Place it in a sealed crucible and nurture it with three *liang* of fire, regardless of duration. When ready, remove and dissolve it into treasure. Alternatively, add more mercury at any time, doubling the amount—this is called the *Zhengyang* Dao (\"True Yang Way\"). To make *Duti Danyang*, take one *liang* of *yongquan* to transmute one *jin*.\n\nWhen preparing, first take one *jin* of alum salt and one *jin* of mercury, grind them together, discard the black residue, and add *yongquan*. Wash the mercury with warm water until clean, then place it in the crucible. Keep the fire two fingers’ width from the bottom of the medicine crucible, nurturing it with three *liang* of fire day and night without interruption. The crucible should have a well-fitted lid—this is most effective. Avoid damage or cracks; a thick body is best.\n\n**Long-Life Real Person’s Cinnabar Formula**\nTake four *liang* of cinnabar in lumps, half a *jin* of green salt, and one *liang* of *quesha*. Grind the green salt separately into powder, mix with vinegar until slightly damp, and divide into four portions. Spread one portion at the bottom, layering cinnabar like lotus seeds planted in sand, then cover with one portion of roasted cinnabar. Next, cover with stone salt, then add another layer of cinnabar. Repeat this three times, then use the remaining portion to cover and press firmly. First seal the container with a tile, then place it in a furnace lined with four *cun* of ash. Position the container inside, cover it with ash four *cun* thick on all sides, and nurture it with four *liang* of fire for seven full days.\n\nRemove when cool, discard the tile, and cover with the container’s lid. Seal the rim tightly with red halloysite clay, then reinforce securely with Six-One Mud. Place in an ash pit and calcine with three *jin* of raw and matured fire until thoroughly red. After a long while, withdraw the fire and smother with five *sheng* of ash. Once cool, remove and gently inspect the cinnabar for tempering—if it appears ashen, discard the container. The cinnabar, unbroken, marks the first transformation.\n\nTake one *liang* of *quesha* and half a *jin* of green salt, grind both together into powder, then add a little water to form a paste. Mix this evenly into the previous container’s contents, adjusting moisture to suit. Layer the cinnabar and cover with the medicine as before, without sealing. Place in the ash pit and nurture with three *liang* of fire. Every one *fu* period, add fire five or six times, ensuring no interruption. Nurture for a full seven days, then cool completely. Remove the cinnabar—if it is purple, it is excellent, marking the second transformation. If it remains soft and brittle, grind the cinnabar into powder, add a little green vitriol, and grind evenly. Shape into a pellet using layered paper, secure with thread, and coat thickly with vinegar-ground ink until fully encased. Once dry, place the pellet in the container, cover without sealing, and evenly cover with ash. Nurture with three *liang* of fire for three *fu* periods, then calcine with five *jin* of fire until thoroughly red. When cool, the cinnabar pellet should appear snow-white, marking the third transformation’s completion.\n\nRemove the cinnabar, wash clean to remove saltiness, and dry by baking. Combine with one *ge* of cow’s milk in a bamboo tube with nodes, seal tightly, and suspend in a well for seven days. Retrieve the cinnabar, dry in the sun, and grind into powder. Cook jujubes and form into pills the size of *meng* beans. On a *jiachen* day, purify oneself, burn incense, and take one pill. Increase by one pill each day until the seventh day, then reduce by one pill, continuing this cycle of increase and decrease. After sixty days, effects will manifest, extending to a full year—one’s body will feel light and age will reverse. After three years, the complexion will resemble that of a child, and one’s pace will match that of a galloping horse.\n\nProlonged ingestion grants longevity, fallen teeth regrow, and if one can further refine the black *ding* into the elixir of immortality, one becomes a transcendent being. For transmutation, no need to remove the fire-toxin—use it directly.\n\n**Bone-Replacing, Form-Preserving, Snow-Descending Elixir**\nMeng Yaofu personally attested: I suffered from kidney-wind, lower-body itching, and hemorrhoids for over twenty years. After taking this elixir for a month, the ailments vanished entirely. After a hundred days of ingestion, the Three Corpses were expelled, my stride matched that of a galloping horse, my face and eyes radiated light, my teeth and hair renewed, and my complexion became like that of a maiden. Its divine efficacy defies full description. For transmutation, one pill subdues three *liang* of mercury, instantly forming supreme treasure.\n\n**Elixir Refinement Method**\nTake four *liang* of *chen* cinnabar and place it in a silver vessel. Boil with hundred-flower honey for seven full days and nights, then remove. Mix with ten *liang* of pine-resin powder and fine honey to a damp incense-like consistency. Line the bottom of a container, then plant the cinnabar like lotus roots, covering it with the remaining half. Seal the container firmly with Six-One mud. Once dry, place it in an ash bed and nurture with four *liang* of fire for three *fu* periods. When cool, remove the cinnabar, wash it clean, and cover each piece with gold foil. Take half a *jin* of *shizhonghuang*, pound it into fine powder, and spread half in a silver box, pressing firmly. Plant the cinnabar within, then cover with the remaining *shizhonghuang* powder, pressing tightly. Seal the seams with vinegar-mixed red halloysite. Place the box inside a large cauldron, encase it in gold-colored mica powder, and seal completely. Nurture in an ash bed with one *jin* of fire for three seven-day periods. When cool, retrieve it—it will resemble gold. For ingestion, place the elixir in a double-layered silk bag, suspend it in a well one *chi* above the water, and retrieve it after a night. Grind finely into powder, mix with the natural juice of fresh Solomon’s seal in a silver vessel, and simmer into a paste. Form into pills the size of *meng* beans. Take one pill daily on an empty stomach with well-flower water. For transmutation, do not remove the fire-toxin. Place one pill with three *liang* of mercury in a crucible, cover tightly with a dish, seal the edges with four layers of damp paper to prevent black *qi* leakage. Nurture in an ash bed with fire to form treasure. To produce yellow gold, add one *liang* each of realgar and Buddha’s-head blue to the fire-subdued cinnabar, grind into powder, and place in the previous container, sealing it completely. Also encase it in an outer container, nurture in an ash bed with one *jin* of fire for three seven-day periods, then calcine with a *cheng* of fire. When cool, retrieve it—it will be the color of purple gold. The silver box, touched by the elixir’s *qi*, will also turn yellow. Use this elixir to transmute mercury into top-grade yellow gold. Guard this secret closely.\n\n**Crimson-Snow, Flowing-Pearl Elixir Method**\nTake one *jin* of translucent, flawless realgar, pound and sift it, then moisten with vinegar. After two days, when dry, moisten again—repeat this ten times. Mix with white alum powder, then cover with alum and seal. After a day and night, dry over gentle fire, gradually increasing the heat but avoiding intensity. After another day and night, apply strong fire until the lower crucible glows like the fire itself, without allowing the fire’s strength to wane even momentarily. Burn thus for three days and nights, then cool for one *fu* period. Open the upper crucible to retrieve the refined essence, grind it finely, and combine with the residue from the lower crucible. Moisten with cooked rice and arrange as before. Refine with gentle and strong fire as previously, until the elixir glows brilliantly red, forming strands like hanging pearls or a spread net. Its radiance dazzles the eyes, startling the heart and spirit of all who see it. For sudden afflictions, near-death, or even apparent death, grind the elixir to the size of three or four sesame seeds, mix with egg yolk, and administer. The patient will raise their head upon ingestion, and recovery follows shortly. Minor malarial fevers are cured instantly. Its divine efficacy defies full description. Alas, the uninitiated hastily use it for gold-making.\n\n**Green Cinnabar Transmutation into Golden Millet Elixir Method**\nCures all wind ailments, extends life, preserves youth, heals myriad diseases, and enables transmutation. Use yellow lead, white clay, and tile powder, mixed with salt and vinegar into a hard mud. Shape wax into spherical molds, coat the spheres with the mud, ensuring no cracks. Dry in shade, then open a small hole and burn away the wax mold. Take fine, lustrous *chen* cinnabar, grind it into powder, roll in stiff paper, and pour into the sphere. Seal the hole with earthworm mud and let dry. Forge an iron ring to match the sphere’s shape, embed the sphere within, and place it in a cauldron, securing it so the top and bottom remain unobstructed. Pour lead-niter solution into the cauldron to a depth of two *cun*, then nurture with chaff fire, ensuring it does not cool. Wait until the lead melts. Maintain this for one hundred twenty days, increasing the fire, then remove and calcine on the ground. When cool, retrieve the elixir—it will resemble green-purple snail shells. Discard the black, unusable portions. Take half the elixir, place it in a green bamboo tube, seal it, and steam with milk five times, changing the milk thrice. The milk skin can treat wild goiter. Retrieve the elixir and bury it in a pit for three nights. Grind it into fine powder, mix with millet porridge, and form into millet-sized pills. Those aged forty take one pill, fifty take two, sixty take three—do not exceed this dosage. It cures all wind ailments and extends life while preserving youth. Place the remaining fine elixir powder in a crucible, layer it with one *liang* of fine alum powder above and below, and seal completely.\n\nWhen the elixir is dry, place it in ashes to nurture for forty-nine days, then calcine with great fire. Once cool, open the vessel—all will have transformed into golden millet grains. Take one *sheng* of mouse-tail-shaped cinnabar and form it into a stick, then take three *liang* of *shushi* (ochre) and half a portion of true *geng* (lead). First melt the *geng* into liquid in a crucible, then add three or four grains of golden millet, which will transmute into true Western metal. The perforated ball must be placed with its hole facing upward inside the lead crucible, then nurtured with fire below.\n\n**Method for Refining *Geng* Powder:**\nTake ten *liang* of fine *geng* and fifty *liang* of mercury, place them in a porcelain jar, and keep warm with fire. Heat the *geng* until red-hot, then immerse it in mercury, stirring with a willow twig until the *geng* dissolves completely. Take three *jin* of *guan* flower (alum) and grind it finely with gold mud, then place it in a large cauldron and level it. Cover tightly with a basin, seal all around with mud to ensure airtightness, and calcine slowly until the mercury sublimes onto the basin—continue until the mercury is fully volatilized. Next, rinse with water to remove the *guan* flavor completely, then dry the refined *geng* powder in the sun. Grind it finely and incorporate it into the elixir.\n\nTake eight *liang* of cockscomb-shaped realgar, eight *liang* of lamellar orpiment, four *liang* of halite, ten *liang* of gold powder, and five *liang* of golden millet. Grind these five ingredients into a fine powder. Transfer them to a new crucible, following the previous method, and evenly coat the interior with ink ground from musk and rice vinegar. Place the elixir inside and heat with gentle and strong fire alternately until the elixir liquefies. Add four *liang* of finely ground nitre powder to the crucible, filling it tightly with thick paste. Seal the opening with paper, cover with a lid, and ensure it is airtight and dry. As before, place it in the crucible, seal it tightly, and pour molten lead over the vessel to a depth of two *cun*. Choose an auspicious day and begin firing at midnight during the *zi* hour, starting with six *liang* of fuel and increasing by one *liang* each day until sixty days are complete. Once cool, chisel open the vessel, remove the lead, and retrieve the crucible—the elixir will have turned the color of purple gold. Grind one *fen* of it finely in a mortar; it can transmute one *jin* of mercury into gold instantly. This is not something ordinary people can obtain—it is a secret transmission from the immortals. If used to aid the Dao, one must know contentment.\n\n**Coating *Geng*:**\nGrind one *liang* of green vitriol, five *qian* of white alum, three *qian* of salt, and eight *qian* of saltpeter into a fine powder. Knead sweet clay into a trough, shape the *geng* into hairpins, dip them in water, then roll them in the powder mixture. Place them in the trough and heat over fire. Remove and dip in a water basin—repeat this process five times to achieve a superior, jewel-like color.\n\n**Tai Xu Ling Sha Dan (Elixir of Supreme Void Numinous Cinnabar)**\nThe *Dongxuan Ji* states: \"Refine the Nine Cycles of Golden Liquid Dragon-Tiger Great Elixir.\" Ge Xianweng of the *Baopuzi* said: \"The method for the Supreme Clarity Divine Elixir originates from the Primordial Lord, who was the teacher of Laozi and the greatest of celestial deities. He harmonizes yin and yang, commands wind and rain, rides clouds and dragons, and all the immortals of heaven are subject to him. Even my own study of the Dao has been achieved through the ingestion of this elixir. The superior adept who obtains it becomes an official of heaven; the middling adept dwells in the mountains; the lesser adept enjoys longevity in the world. Foolish people do not believe in it, dismissing it as empty words. From morning to night, they seek only the means of death, never pursuing life—how could heaven force life upon them? Most people crave only fine food, beautiful clothes, music, sensual pleasures, wealth, and honor. Indulging their passions and desires, they treat life lightly, hastening their demise. Take care not to speak of the golden elixir to such people, lest they mock the Dao and slander the truth. Do not transmit the elixir scriptures to those who are not of noble character; only to those of sincere faith may they be passed on.\"\n\nHe further instructed his disciples: \"According to the *Huangdi Jiuding Shendan Jing*, the Yellow Emperor ascended as an immortal by ingesting it. Breathing exercises and herbal medicines can only prolong life and cure illness—they cannot prevent death. If one wholeheartedly consumes the divine elixir, one’s lifespan becomes boundless, enduring as long as heaven and earth. One may ride clouds and dragons to ascend to the Great Clarity—all due to this divine elixir. Yixuanzi warns: This Dao is of utmost importance and must be transmitted only to the worthy. Even if someone amasses gold like mountains, do not speak of this to them. Those without immortal bones must also not be allowed to know of it. If those who do not believe in the Dao learn of it, they will not only slander the divine elixir but also prevent its successful refinement. Only those with immortal bones and sincere faith in the elixir Dao may, after the elixir is completed, ascend as immortals with their entire households. Yet people today do not believe in the divine elixir, preferring instead to trust in herbal medicines. But herbs, once buried, decay—how can they grant longevity when ingested? Cinnabar is the substance of immortality; when refined and consumed, how could it not extend life? The masses of the world are foolish and ignorant, craving only wealth and indulging their desires, seeking nothing but death. How could they know that those who cultivate the truth dwell in the world yet transcend it, restraining themselves and pledging their hearts to the pursuit of attainment? If gentlemen who savor the Dao have aspirations in this regard, to together propagate the mystery of the Way—is this not wonderful?\"\n\n**Sun Zhenren’s Elixir Scripture: Chapter on the Five Metals and Eight Minerals**\n**Five Metals:** Cinnabar, mercury, realgar, orpiment, sulfur.\n**Eight Minerals:** Azurite, malachite, chalcanthite, arsenic, borax, white alum, white vitriol, nitre.\n\nThe five metals die when encountering mercury; the eight minerals perish when meeting nitre. Cinnabar, realgar, and orpiment are called \"sentient substances,\" each with distinct uses. *Sengxi* yellow, *shiting* fat, and sweet sulfur are three substances with different names but the same nature. When refined with fire, they excel at transmuting silver into red mercury, forming the great treasure.\n\n*Concluding Volume Three of Various Divine Elixir Methods*\n*Beginning Volume Four of Various Divine Elixir Methods*\n\n**Section on Cinnabar (from the Five Metals)**\nCinnabar is both water and fire. Take eight taels of fine, genuine cinnabar and place it in a smooth, new porcelain vessel. Pack the vessel’s rim with damp earth to prevent smoke from escaping. Take eight taels of mercury and five *haima* (sea horses), grind them to powder, and mix evenly with the cinnabar and mercury. Next, take fine *chige* (red grass) stalks, half-dried, burn them to ash, and place the ash in an earthen jar. Pour water over it to leach the liquid, then use a cast-iron cauldron with a frost-like patina on its base. Line the bottom and cover the top of the porcelain vessel with this, and heat it with gentle and strong fire until the vessel gradually warms. Then apply intense fire to calcine it, melt it into liquid, and remove it to form white cinnabar. Place it in a tripod over a furnace, following the methods in the previous elixir scriptures: weigh the proportions precisely, arrange them according to yin-yang positions, and cycle them in accordance with the *Can Tong Qi* (Token for the Agreement of the Three). Align with the four seasons, eight solar terms, twenty-four qi phases, seventy-two pentads, and the celestial patterns of years, months, days, and hours—without the slightest error. Nurture it gently, like a hen brooding eggs, for one hundred twenty days. Remove it, grind it into fine powder, and form pills with *chuanbanxia* (pinellia) juice, each the size of a millet grain. Consuming one pill extends life by three hundred years; ten pills, three thousand years. Its power transforms the intestines, and it is called *Shenfu Baixue Dan* (Divine Talisman White Snow Elixir), excelling at transmuting blood into milk. If one encounters a perfected being who points to the true qi of the Mysterious Female and the One, and can stabilize the embryo and preserve the spirit, ascension is certain within three years. The elixir’s inner workings follow the rhythms of heaven and earth, aligning with the four seasons—this is the principle of the first transformation. With this, all silver, gold, and minerals from mountains and marshes can be instantly transmuted into supreme treasures. If the elixir is used to refine mercury, it will subdue its volatility and transmute it into treasure. Stirring it fifty or sixty times in one place can turn base gold into the finest treasure. This elixir is called *Shenfu Baixue* (Divine Talisman White Snow) among the great elixirs. The superior person values life over wealth; the inferior, wealth over life. This elixir must not be transmitted to the unworthy.\n\n**Section on Realgar (from the Five Metals)**\nRealgar originates from Wudu Mountain, embodying the qi of metal and wood. Take fine, deep red realgar resembling a rooster’s comb, and grind it to a fine powder. Use high-quality *guming* (bright) green vitriol, *zijin* (purple gold), *longya* (dragon sprouts), and the frost-like stalks of *chige* (red grass, also called *chige*). Layer these seven substances in a new porcelain jar, placing the elixir inside. Cover it and heat with gentle and strong fire, gradually increasing the intensity. Then apply intense fire until it sweats, remove the top, and place it on stone for three days until it turns gold-red. Return it to the porcelain jar and nurture it with chaff fire for nine days. Remove it, melt mountain silver into liquid gold, and use the elixir to transmute it—it will instantly become treasure, with a ten-thousand-fold success rate.\n\n**Section on Orpiment (from the Five Metals)**\nOrpiment also comes from Wudu Mountain, embodying the qi of metal and wood. Take fine, golden orpiment resembling *yueye* (moon leaves), grind it to a fine powder, and combine it with high-quality bright green vitriol, *yimucao* (motherwort), *yiwushou* (black nightshade), and *longyacao* (dragon sprouts). Burn these to ash, leach the liquid, and boil it into a frost-like paste. Layer it in a new porcelain jar, place the elixir inside, cover it, and heat with gentle and strong fire, gradually increasing the intensity. Then apply intense fire to calcine it until the smoke ceases and it melts into liquid. This can transmute fine mountain silver into supreme treasure.\n\n**Section on Sulfur (from the Five Metals)**\nFor sulfur, use sweet sulfur, *sengxi* yellow, or *shiting* fat—three substances with different names but the same nature. Use fine, bright, crystalline green vitriol, or burn *chige* (red grass) to ash, leach the liquid, and boil it into frost. Layer it in a new porcelain jar, place the elixir inside, cover it, and heat with gentle and strong fire, gradually increasing the intensity. Then apply intense fire to destroy it until the smoke ceases and it melts into liquid. This can transmute silver into treasure.\n\n**Section on White Superior Yellow (from the Five Metals)**\nWhite Superior Yellow originates from the peaks of Shangdang Mountain, resembling red powder in color. Next, use fine cinnabar, transparent as crystal—the foremost among the five metals. Take *chige* (red grass) ash, *zijin* (purple gold), *longya* (dragon sprouts), and *huangqin* (skullcap), burn them to ash, leach the liquid, and boil it into frost. Layer it in a new porcelain jar, place the elixir inside, cover it, and heat with gentle and strong fire, gradually increasing the intensity. Then apply intense fire to calcine it until the smoke ceases and it melts into liquid. This can transmute raw iron and copper into treasure, and refine mercury into treasure as well.\n\n**Section on Azurite (from the Eight Minerals)**\n\n**Section on Azurite (from the Eight Minerals)**\nAzurite is found atop Mount Tai, its color resembling azure-green, fresh as greenish-yellow seeds, its form like this. Grind it into fine powder, refine saltpeter with the prescribed method, and layer it in a porcelain jar.

It excels at removing black and greenish tarnish from silver.\n\nThe Five Metals and Eight Minerals correspond to the Five Stars, Five Sacred Peaks, and Five Phases of Heaven and Earth. The Five Viscera of humans align with the Five Metals. The Eight Minerals correspond to the Eight Trigrams. If one can refine them, they excel at transmutation and can be ingested to prolong life and endure cold and heat. The methods for the Five Metals and Eight Minerals refine cinnabar and gold, transmute various substances, and subdue the Five Metals.\n\n**Methods for Subduing the Five Metals**\n**Subduing Cinnabar (Primary Method)**\n*Method for Subduing Cinnabar with Herbs (from the* Purple Empyrean Elixir Classic *of Master Ge)*\nTake cinnabar in lumps, regardless of quantity, wrap it in sheep’s tripe grass, collect and dry it, also without fixed amount. Grind it thoroughly into powder. In a porcelain container, first place half the powder, then arrange the cinnabar in the center, and cover it with the remaining powder, packing it tightly. Calcine it with three to five catties of charcoal fire until evenly heated, then use it.\n\n**Method for Subduing Cinnabar into Silver**\nTwo taels of alum powder, one qian of saltpeter powder, a small amount of *jinchi* (golden wings), and one tael of cinnabar. Grind these ingredients into powder. First melt one and a half taels of *pengsha* (borax) in a spoon until half-cooked, then grind it into powder before adding the other medicinal powders. Grind them together, place in a tea bowl, and simmer over low heat, then grind again into powder. Coat each piece of cinnabar by holding it in the mouth, then apply the medicinal powder. Take one and a half taels of mountain-refined silver, hammer it into two round sheets. Place one sheet at the bottom of a porcelain container, arrange the cinnabar pieces, and scatter silver bits the size of barley grains among them. Cover with the other sheet, fill the gaps with silver, and seal tightly with Six-One Mud. Once dry, calcine first with gentle fire, then with strong fire until red-hot. Cool, then place in the Flower Pool to refine into treasure.\n\n**Method for Subduing White Cinnabar**\nEqual parts of *jvnücao* (maiden grass), *gansui* (kan-sui), *xusuizi* (caper spurge), and *woju* (lettuce). Grind them into powder, place one qian of the herbal powder in a container, then arrange the cinnabar, cover it with the remaining powder, seal tightly, and heat with gentle and strong fire for one *fu* period.\n\n**Method for Subduing Cinnabar**\nFive taels of silver powder, five taels of fine cinnabar, and eight gold leaves. In a porcelain container, first place four gold leaves, then a layer of silver powder, then arrange the cinnabar in the center. Alternate layers of silver powder and cinnabar until all are used, then fill the gaps with lead powder and oyster shell powder, seal tightly, and dry. Cover the top, heat with four taels of fire, and nurture for two seven-day periods.\n\n**Method for Refining Cinnabar with Herbs**\n*Dìdǎn* grass, *zhāngliǔ*, *dàjǐ* (kan-sui), *sháoyào* (peony), *jiǎndāo* grass, and *mǎchǐ* grass. Take equal parts of the fresh herbs listed above, pound them into a paste, place the cinnabar in the center, and seal tightly. Once dry, calcine with two to three catties of charcoal fire until it melts into liquid.\n\n**Herbal Method for Subduing Cinnabar**\nRemove the roots of *mǎchǐ* (purslane) and *wǔfāng* grass. Place three taels of cinnabar in a porcelain container: first lay a layer of herbs, then arrange the cinnabar, and cover with another layer of herbs. Seal tightly and calcine with fire.\n\n**Method for Subduing Cinnabar**\nOne tael of cinnabar and one tael of white alum. First spread half of the alum in a crucible and melt it into liquid, then place the cinnabar, and cover with the remaining alum. Arrange all layers, then calcine with fire until thoroughly red.\n\n**Method for Subduing Cinnabar into Metal (Jīn)**\nHalf a catty of fine *shénjǐn* cinnabar, half a tael each of yellow alum, *shídǎn* (chalcanthite), *jīguān* realgar, and *pào shā* (calcined cinnabar). Grind all into powder, mix with rice vinegar into a paste, and boil in a porcelain pot until slightly bubbling—this suffices. Boil for ten days or more; if the cinnabar remains unchanged, it is ready. If not, continue boiling until subdued by fire. Form into glutinous rice-sized pills. For every tael of mercury, place one pill in a vessel, nurture with four taels of fire for one tea period, and it will become a treasure.\n\n**Method for Refining and Subduing Cinnabar into Supreme Treasure Medicine**\nTake one tael of fine cinnabar, the size of dice, wrap it in two layers of gold foil, and place it in a porcelain container. Line the bottom and cover the top with *jiǔzhuǎn* subdued-fire refined salt as a protective layer, filling and pressing firmly. Evenly cover with oyster shell powder, seal properly, and first nurture with one tael of fire from the *chén* hour (7–9 AM) to the *wǔ* hour (11 AM–1 PM), then increase the fire to three catties until red-hot. Allow to cool, open the container, remove the oyster shell first, then retrieve the cinnabar—now subdued by fire. If the cinnabar retains its original color, it is ready as a protective layer, purged of fire toxins, and suitable for consumption. Form into sesame-sized pills with honey; ingestion prolongs life. If reused in a container, wrap the cinnabar in gold or silver foil, nurture with fire for twenty-one days, and it will fully become treasure—gold foil yields metal (jīn), silver foil yields silver.\n\n**Nine-Turn Method for Subduing Mercury with Cinnabar**\nTake five taels of fine cinnabar and gather moss from the shady side of an old wall, drying and grinding it into powder. Grind the cinnabar into powder, place it in an oil-permeable container, lining the bottom and covering the top with moss powder. Mix earthworm castings and salt into a paste, seal the container with a layer one finger thick, and let dry. Place it on a *bó* (clay support), calcine with one catty of fire until red-hot. Once cool, remove and break into lumps—its color will be purplish-red. Grind into powder again and calcine as before; its color will deepen. Without pressing, it will later transform into a purplish-red hue, lustrous as a mirror reflecting people. Repeat the process nine times, and it becomes suitable for consumption, prolonging life—this is the *jiǔzhuǎn* cinnabar protective layer.\n\n**Master Dīng’s Precious Crucible Method for Subduing Cinnabar**\nFive taels of fine cinnabar, ground into powder. One tael of *jiēzhōu* rock salt powder and two taels of *Qín* soil from outside the east gate of Fengxiang, both ground into powder. Separately, use clay to form a crucible base, shaping it like a *gān* crucible, ensuring it is smooth. Pound and extract the natural juice from the stems and leaves of purple-stemmed lettuce, mix it with the previously prepared salt powder and *Qín* soil, stirring until even and of proper consistency. Coat the crucible base with this mixture to form a *gān* crucible, about five *fēn* thick. If not firm enough, add paper and pound until well-mixed, then reshape. Remove the base, dry thoroughly over a gentle fire, fill the crucible’s mouth with cinnabar, and tightly pack a bundle of purple-stemmed lettuce stems to seal it, preventing gas escape. Leave about half the space above, tie the bundle securely with thread, and place the crucible on a *bó* with a small central depression to hold it steady. Surround with fire and calcine until thoroughly red-hot, then cease when smoke dissipates. Remove from fire, let cool, and the cinnabar will resemble amber in color and luster, luminous enough to reflect people—suitable for consumption and life extension. To refine further into a protective layer, repeat the process three to five times; each turn enhances its brilliance, weight, and spiritual efficacy, the details of which cannot be fully described. It subdues all mineral medicines, transforming them as desired. Only the *Three Yellows* (sulfur, realgar, orpiment) resist alteration; calcining requires at least two catties of fire. This method was once presented to Commander Wang of the Gold and Feather Guard.\n\n**Master Sūn’s Alchemical Classic: Various Methods for Subduing Cinnabar**\n\n**Method for Subduing Cinnabar with Stone Yellow**\nFour taels of cinnabar and one catty of *shímiáo* (stone sprouts). Grind both into fine powder, place in a cinnabar or porcelain container to about half its capacity, and press firmly. Insert a wooden mold, pack *shíhuáng* (stone yellow) around it, then remove the mold. Lightly moisten the cinnabar with water and roll it in borax. Fill the cavity with *shízhōnghuáng* (stone-center yellow), cover with *shíhuáng*, seal tightly, and let dry. Bury in a one- to two-*chǐ* deep pit, fill with dry horse manure, and burn for two seven-day periods, replenishing the manure to maintain uninterrupted fire. After the full duration, apply three catties of fire on top until fully calcined. Once cool, retrieve it—its color will be peach-blossom red, melting into a treasure for any use.\n\n**Method for Subduing Fire with Cinnabar**\nUse cinnabar in nuggets, any quantity. First, grind purple-skinned garlic into a paste and evenly coat the inside of a new *gān* crucible to a thickness of about one finger. Line the bottom with *gǒuqǐ* (goji) leaves, mix the cinnabar with garlic paste, place it in the crucible, cover with another layer of *gǒuqǐ* leaves, and press firmly with garlic paste. Seal the mouth with a tile, coat with red clay, and reinforce with paper-fiber mortar to a uniform thickness of one finger.\n\nAllow to dry in the shade, then place in an ash pit and nurture with civil and martial fire for one *fu* period. Apply ten catties of fire until fully calcined. Once cool, retrieve and heat the cinnabar over fire until red, then quench in saltwater until the desired color is achieved—this subdues the fire. If the cinnabar crumbles upon biting, reseal as before and apply five catties of fire to complete the process.\n\n**Method for Subduing White Cinnabar**\nBoil two taels of Sichuan pepper in one *sheng* of water until reduced to half. Cool the liquid. Grind one tael of silver foil into powder, combine with four *qian* of mercury, and pound with the pepper into a paste. Strain through raw silk to extract the mercury paste. Adjust the size and quantity of cinnabar nuggets to form cakes of one tael each, then chew thoroughly in the mouth. Use seven cloves to assess the cinnabar in the mouth, then sandwich it between two mercury paste cakes, ensuring even thickness. Mix equal parts of cassia bark, white aconite, *wasong* (moss on tiles), Sichuan pepper, and lotus leaves into a powder. Sprinkle half into a container to form a nest for the cinnabar cakes. For ingestion, apply a layer of yellow lead (*huangdan*) about one *qian* thick, place the cinnabar on top, and cover with another *qian* of yellow lead. Fill the container with the remaining powder, seal the seams with red halloysite mixed with vinegar, and reinforce with mortar to a uniform thickness. Calcine with half a *chen* of charcoal fire to produce white cinnabar (omit the yellow lead if not needed).\n\n**Method for Boiling Cinnabar into a Treasure**\nTake five leaves of *jingfeng* grass, one tael each of sour nuggets and cinnabar. Place each in a silk bag, tie securely, and dip halfway in rice vinegar. Place in an iron vessel with half a *jin* of rice vinegar, two *sheng* of water, and two taels of *mu furong* (hibiscus) branches and leaves. Boil for one *fu* period over a slow fire. Remove, drain, and select the cinnabar, discarding the rest.\n\n**Another Method for Refining Cinnabar**\nMelt three taels of cinnabar in a crucible until liquefied, using a slow fire. Once fully molten and boiling, pour onto the ground, collect the cinnabar, and return it to a *gan* crucible. Heat until it smokes and liquefies again, then pour into a bran trough to form silver.\n\n**Zhang Zihou’s *Grass-Seeing Treasure Elixir* Method**\n**First Boiling Method**\nGrind two taels each of *yangti* root, *diding*, *you* grass, *didancao*, and *yimucao* into coarse powder. Use one *dou* and five *sheng* of river water to boil eight taels of bright cinnabar (avoid finely crushed or impure pieces) with the herbs in a silver or stone vessel, suspended above the liquid. Boil for one *fu* period, maintaining a gentle simmer like fish eyes. Replenish water as needed, then rinse the cinnabar with river water after boiling.\n\n**Second Calcining Method and Fire Nurturing**\nGrind two taels each of *songluo*, *diyu*, *baihuacai*, and *yindijue* into powder. Mix with raw honey to a consistency like moist incense. Spread one-third of the mixture on the bottom of a container, arrange the cinnabar like lotus seeds without touching, and cover with another layer of the mixture. Repeat until all cinnabar and powder are used, pressing firmly on top. Seal the seams with red halloysite mixed with vinegar, then coat the entire vessel with *liuyi* mud to a thickness of one finger. Allow to dry in the shade, ensuring no cracks; if any appear, patch with mud. Cover with a three-finger-thick layer of vinegar-mixed grass ash, pressing firmly. Place five catties of charcoal beneath, ignite from the top, and calcine until half is consumed. Add another five catties, then another five catties once half is consumed again. When nearly half remains, cover with a basin overnight. Retrieve the cinnabar, place in a clean sand container, seal the seams with red halloysite, and set in a small earthen jar. Elevate with a three-legged iron stand, bury in paper-money ash to a depth of four fingers above the container. At the *zi* and *wu* hours, add four taels of mature fire. Nurture for two seven-day periods, then apply a strong fire to fully calcine without losing the true subdued fire. For ingestion, grind into fine powder, form into *tongzi*-sized pills with pinellia paste, and take on an empty stomach with warm water. For transmutation or storage, boil three times, replacing the herbs each time, and follow the previous fire-nurturing method. For transmutation, form into pills with paper mulberry juice—ten pills per tael, each pill transmuting one tael of copper into treasure. For storage, mix three *qian* of silver and seven *qian* of mercury, grind into cinnabar, and divide into ten pills. Use eight taels of previously calcined cinnabar as a base powder, spreading half on the bottom and half on top. Follow the initial cinnabar-nurturing method: first nurture for twenty-one days, then reduce by one day each time until the fire is vigorous, nurturing for only one *fu* period to form the supreme treasure—this is the *Elixir of Longevity*.\n\n**Method for Subduing Cinnabar with Half-Tael Coins (from *Xuanzhenzi’s Concordance Records*)**\nTake any quantity of half-tael coins, heat each until thoroughly red, then quench in vinegar. Coat the coins with sulfur powder after wetting with warm water, place in a container, and cover with more sulfur powder. Seal, allow to dry, then cover the top. Nurture with four taels of fire for three days, then calcine until fully red. Cool, grind finely, and use to subdue cinnabar following the previous fire-nurturing method. Store as an elixir. For subdued cinnabar, add raw cinnabar—more is better, especially if using high-quality mother cinnabar.\n\n**Method for Subduing Cinnabar**\nLine a container with bamboo and seal. Calcine with a strong fire until thoroughly red, then cool and retrieve. Do not nurture. Use two taels of arsenic trioxide, half a tael of *fen shuang* (calomel), one tael of *hanshuishi* (calcium sulfate), one tael of *jin fan* (alum), and one *fen* of saltpeter.\n\nGrind the above ingredients to a fine powder and place in a small jar, separating them with black paper. Then transfer to a larger jar, filling the surrounding space with lime. Repeat this process without limit until no sound is heard, then gradually withdraw the fire. Once cooled, retrieve a jadelike mass. For each use, take a piece the size of a soapberry, add to one tael of *mao* (lead?), stir with a willow twig, and pour out to form a treasure.\n\n**Method for Subduing Cinnabar with Licorice**\nTake eight taels of firm, solid licorice and grind to a fine powder, along with two and a half taels of cinnabar, also finely ground. Spread a thin layer of licorice powder—about three *fen* thick—in a porcelain container, then add a layer of cinnabar powder. Alternate layers of licorice and cinnabar, repeating until all the cinnabar is used, with a final top layer of licorice powder about three to five *fen* thick. Seal the container all around with paper and mud, secure it with an iron wire mesh, and seal again with paper and mud to resemble a ball. Dig a wide pit in the ground, surround the container with embers, and cover the embers with crushed husks. Ignite with approximately one *chen* of charcoal, firing until thoroughly red, then cease at the desired time. Remove the container—ensuring nothing burns inside—and reseal it as before. Surround it again with embers and husks, firing once more in the same manner. Once cooled, the cinnabar will be subdued. Store it in a crucible container and submerge in a well to dispel fire toxins. After one *fu* period, grind the cinnabar finely, mix with glutinous rice porridge, and form into pills the size of peas. Take one pill daily. If used for transmutation, do not dispel fire toxins; instead, store it in an elixir vessel and refine it through nine cycles for divine efficacy.\n\n*End of Scroll Four of Divine Elixir Methods from Various Schools*\n*Scroll Five of Divine Elixir Methods from Various Schools*\n\n**Purple Empyrean Scripture’s Method for Subduing Mercury**\n*Huainan King’s Cinnabar Seed Method for Subduing Mercury*\nGather *dijin* in spring, lotus leaves and rattan in autumn, *liushouzi* and *wufangcao* in autumn. Take equal parts of the above, pound while moist into a paste, then mix with one *liang* of mercury. Fire with one to two *jin* of fuel until red-hot, then cool and remove the vessel. Take three *liang* of frost-white *yimucao*, blend with water, and place the cinnabar within. Fire with three to five *jin* of fuel, and it becomes a treasure.\n\n**Three Grades of Minor Return Elixir: Method for Restraining Mercury**\n*Xuanhu*, reed catkins, and bright cinnabar mercury—five *liang* each. Grind the above together, place in a crucible, and pack tightly with halite. Moisten the mouth to level it, then use an iron pick to pierce five to seven holes the size of chopsticks. Insert a perforated tile over the crucible’s mouth, sinking it about one *cun* deep. Center a hole in the tile and seat it atop a flat-bottomed water vessel, ensuring all seams are sealed. Once dry, surround it with charcoal, starting with half a *jin* and increasing to three *jin*. After one *fu* period, when the crucible glows the same color as the fire, the mercury will descend entirely into the small vessel—five *liang* each. No refining is lost, and both mercury and medicine turn thoroughly red.\n\nTake this medicine again, then take fifteen *liang* of sal ammoniac, first melt it to an oily consistency, stir until clear, and grind to powder. Wrap in alum paper, then take ten parts of calcined lead powder and place it in a tripod as an outer vessel. Inside, use one *jin* of purple fluorite powder, center a golden *niaozi*, and cover it above and below with purple fluorite powder. Top with calcined lead, packing tightly. Gradually expel all yin qi until dry. Seal the tripod with its lid, then reinforce the seal. Once thoroughly dry, place it in the furnace with one *jin* of fire, maintaining it for sixty days without interruption. If the fire wanes, extend by five days. This is called *Purple Gold Sand*. Then take one *liang*, grind to powder, and place ten *liang* of mercury in a cauldron. Cover with the powdered medicine for three days, then seal tightly with an iron lid, embedding its edges. Apply sixty *liang* of fire above and four *liang* below. After three *fu* periods, it naturally forms a sheet of silver, ready for use.\n\nAgain, grind all the previous medicine into powder. Take half a *jin* of sal ammoniac, return it to the vessel, and cover as before. Seal and dry, then fire for sixty days—this is called *Purple Spirit Sand*. As before, take one *liang* of the medicine, grind to powder, and cover one *jin* of mercury. Seal firmly, and within a day it transforms into a cauldron of silver.\n\nGrind all into powder again, mix with half a *jin* of cinnabar, and stir into sand. Follow the previous method, nurturing it for sixty days—this is called the *Minor Return Elixir*. One *liang* makes five hundred pills; each pill, when applied to one *er* of dry mercury, instantly becomes silver.\n\n**Another Method for Restraining Mercury**\nHeat one *liang* of mercury intensely, then drop in one pill of the medicine. The pill darts across the mercury’s surface in all directions, then sinks. The mercury dries instantly. Remove the pill, pour the mercury into a trough, and once cooled, it becomes silver, ready for use.\n\nForm this medicine into pills and consume them to attain longevity, sharing the lifespan of heaven and earth. Carrying one pill of this elixir into the wilderness causes all beasts to submit; birds become phoenixes, dogs become dragons. Those who consume it achieve immortality—this is the *Minor Return Elixir*, transcending great calamities and ranking first among immortals’ arts.\n\n*Song:*\nIf white gold is achieved, the world may be delivered;\nIf white gold fails, one’s efforts are in vain.\nThose who encounter this method\nAre destined by past lives to have immortal affinity,\nTheir names recorded in the celestial registers.\nWithout the ladder to immortality,\nOne would never meet this elixir to consume.\n\n**Method for Subduing Mercury with Green Cloth**\nSpread *dijin* to form a thatched mat. Use only lotus flowers, water chestnut leaves, pagoda tree pods, *yuanzhi*, and gallnuts—never let women know when compounding.\n\nTake the following in equal parts: *dijin*, *mao’er yancao*, lotus flowers, lotus leaves, pagoda tree pods, *yuanzhi*, and gallnuts—one *liang* each—and grind to powder. First line the bottom of a crucible with *dijin*, then spread *mao’er yancao* powder (quantity as needed). Place mercury inside, then cover completely with lotus flowers, lotus leaves, pagoda tree pods, gallnuts, and *yuanzhi*. Seal the crucible’s mouth with a tile, then seal the exterior with two *cun* of mud. Dry in the shade, then fire with five *jin* of charcoal. Dispel fire toxins overnight. The next day, break the crucible to find the mercury solidified into lumps, ready for use.\n\n**Method for Nurturing Green-Gold Heads into Silver with a Herb Vessel**\nEight *qian* of mercury, three *qian* of sulfur, one *qian* of alum, three *qian* of *mu*. Grind to powder.\n\nFirst, slowly stir-fry mercury, sulfur, and alum over low fire to form sand. Then take equal parts of *baiyou*, *baiqian*, Sichuan pepper, Sichuan aconite, *xixin*, and purslane, grind to fine powder, and pound into a paste. Line the inside of a crucible with this paste, adhering it to the walls. Place the green-gold sand inside, then cover with *shanze* powder. Seal with a tile, then coat the exterior with *liuyi* mud one finger thick. Dry in the shade, patching cracks as they form. Once dry, place in a large earthenware or iron pot atop a trivet. Set the medicine ball inside, then nurture the top with *jinsu* fire, maintaining four *liang* of charcoal to keep it warm. The base should remain consistently warm—reduce if too hot, add if too cool. Nurture thus for three days until firm, then apply strong fire. Once cooled, remove the ball and shake it; if it rattles, the substance is complete.\n\n**Sun the Perfected’s Scripture’s Herb Method for Subduing Mercury**\nLotus leaves and *lutí*. First soak sulfur in water overnight, then remove and dry in the shade. Grind to powder, mix with mercury in a pan, and stir-fry to form sand. Wrap in paper and bury in the earth for one *liang* period. When unearthed, it has already become sand.\n\n**Additional Methods**\n\n**Method One**\nCastor leaves, white oxalis with three corners, *hanlian* (eclipta), *dìdīng* (viola), *jinlian* (potentilla), *xùtiān* (cynanchum), and *yúxīngcǎo* (houttuynia)—or use purslane. Grind these to a fine powder, except for purslane, which should be mashed. Then grind with mercury in a mortar, cover with the five herbs, and nurture over ash fire until faint smoke rises. Before completion, pour into water to soften the sand, then remove and wrap in paper. For every *liang* of purslane and mercury, the result will be a pellet the size of a bullet.\n\n**Method Two**\n*Dàotuíténg* (inverted vine, *Datura* flower) and *tiěchángcǎo* (iron-intestine grass). Dry these two ingredients in the shade, grind to powder, and mix with one cup of water in an iron pan. Simmer over gentle and strong fire until dry, then stir-fry until the herbs turn to ash. Pour the already-formed mercury sand into the palm and roll into a single lump.\n\n**Method for Subduing Mercury into Western Sand**\nOne *liang* of mercury, one *qián* of *dǎnfán* (chalcanthite), two *qián* of high-quality *qīngfán* (melanterite), and a soybean-sized piece of *hūshā* (sal ammoniac). Grind these together into a fine powder, add two *qián* of *lóngdǎncǎo* (gentian) powder, and mix thoroughly. Stew with one cup of sour *zǎo* (jujube) juice in an iron pan for the duration of two meals, until dry. Avoid vigorous boiling; let the edges simmer gently for two hours. Lift with a bamboo stick—when it resembles silk floss, remove and wrap the residue in paper. If the sand is incomplete, continue stewing as before. Cover with a bowl and store overnight; by the next day, it will turn red. The pan must be new and unused for best results; avoid grease.\n\n**Sealing and Refining Method**\n*Lúgānshí* (calamine) with star-like patterns, *dàizhěshí* (hematite), and alum in equal parts. Grind these three into a fine powder and place in a crucible. Position the mercury sand in the center and cover it completely with the powder. Then mix *chìshízhī* (red halloysite) and clam powder with water into a stiff paste to seal the crucible’s mouth, ensuring it is thoroughly airtight. Refine with one *jīn* of charcoal fire. When the blue smoke nearly dissipates, remove, let cool, and open to reveal the treasure.\n\n**Another Method**\nFive *liǎng* of mercury, five *liǎng* of *dǎnfán*, five *liǎng* of *qīngfán*, and three and a half *liǎng* of white alum. Grind these into a fine powder. Place the mercury in an iron pan and cover it with the three alum powders. Apply gentle and strong fire on a wind furnace, adding one large bowl of *zǎo* juice. Warm the juice first, then pour it into the pan one cup at a time. To produce *gēng* sand, add five *liǎng* of *lóngdǎncǎo* powder to the alums before stewing. Alternatively, decoct *lóngdǎncǎo* separately into a thick juice, pour into the pan, and stew with the *zǎo* juice to form *gēng* sand. During stewing, maintain a gentle simmer; avoid vigorous boiling at the edges to prevent mercury from spilling. When the edges are dry, remove and let cool. Gently brush aside the alum, pour the sand into a crucible, wash it clean, and let it sit overnight before it turns red. Only then is it ready for the sealing process.\n\n**Method for Subduing Mercury into Western Sand**\nThree *qián* of *mǔ* (mother metal), hammered into foil and cut into pieces. Seven *qián* of mercury, ground with pepper decoction as in the *gǎnqì* method. Then use the following herbs—*máojuǎn* (reed roll), *xiāngtiānquè fěn* (unknown powder), and *wúmíngyì* (pyrolusite)—ground into fine powder, mixed with honey into a paste, and wrapped in cloth. Fry in four *liǎng* of hempseed oil, adding forty-nine *guāzǐ* (melon seeds) one by one until they turn brown. Continue until two-thirds of the oil remains. Clean with a toothbrush to remove excess oil, then store in a sealed container.\n\n**Method for the Mercury-Transforming Bone Elixir**\n*Bìlì* (fig vine), *xiàkūcǎo* (prunella), *yúxīngcǎo* (houttuynia), white *hànlián* (eclipta), and *mùmántóu* (Chinese gall). Grind these into fine powder, refine with honey, and form into pills. Press a hollow in the center of each pill, place mercury inside, and seal the opening with a pinch of salt. Press the pills flat into a bowl, cover top and bottom, and seal the rim with clam powder mixed with vinegar. Further secure with damp paper strips. Then drive three iron nails into the ground to form a tripod, surround with charcoal fire, and cover the bowl with a *dǒu* of dry chaff. Do not fan the fire. By the next day, let cool and remove—the mercury will have congealed. Stew three black plums in three bowls of water, then pour the decoction over the elixir in an iron ladle until it turns white. Melt again in a sand crucible, pour into a mold, dust with wall dust, sprinkle with saltpeter, and return to the crucible. Pour the liquid to form the treasure.\n\n**Method for the Mercury-Congealing Sand Elixir**\nMercury in any quantity, a small amount of *yínmǔ* (silver mother), *jìjiè* (schizonepeta), *qúmài* (dianthus), *huálú* (unknown), and red pepper. Grind these into a coarse powder and gradually add to a pan while stir-frying. When the herbs blacken, remove and discard them. Strain the remaining mixture through double-layered silk. Any untransformed residue should be processed again. For extraction, use *luógēn* (radish root) and one bowl of good vinegar, suspend in a silk bag, and stew in a bottle overnight. Then take a large *nánxīng* (arisaema), mix the mercury and silver powder with honey, place in a star-shaped mold, sprinkle with a small amount of *péngshā* (borax) and *yánghuā* (genkwa) powder on top, cover with more star powder, and seal the mouth with *huángdān* (lead oxide). Secure with toilet paper and clay, let dry, then nurture with *zǐmǔ* (mother-child) fire overnight. At dawn, refine with charcoal fire.\n\n**Another Method**\nOne bowl of *zhāngliǔ* (unknown) juice and one *liǎng* of *fěnshuāng* (calomel). Wrap in silk and stew until the juice is exhausted. Use three *qián* of silver and one *liǎng* of powder to evenly coat. Place in a black bottle with three peppercorns at the bottom, pack the medicine tightly, then add four Sichuan peppercorns on top and seal. Bury the bottle in the ground, secure with *chìshízhī* (red halloysite), and seal all around with toilet paper and clay. Weigh down with a heavy object and refine with five *jīn* of charcoal fire.\n\n**Another Method**\nGrind three *qián* of *mǔ* (cinnabar) into powder, combine with seven *qián* of mercury to form cinnabar sand. Wrap in black paper and boil in Sichuan pepper decoction for three *shí* (six hours). Allow to cool, then bind tightly with raw honey. Use Sichuan pepper, *huánghuā* (yellow flower), *dìdīng* (Chinese violet), or *cǎowūtóu* (wild aconite) as powder—three ingredients in total—and wrap around the outer layer. Alternatively, mix equal parts of *nánxīng* (jack-in-the-pulpit), *wǔbèizǐ* (gallnut), *báiyǒu* (white lime), *báiqiān* (white swallow-wort), *dìjǐn* (Japanese creeper), or *cǎowūtóu* with raw honey to a thickness of half a finger, then wrap around the previous package. Seal the ball with salt-clay and refine with three *jīn* of fire.\n\n**Method for Subduing Mercury Sand**\nPlace one *qián* of *mǔ* (cinnabar) and nine *qián* of mercury in a slow fire, using a small bowl. Sprinkle one *dàqián* (large coin’s worth) of powdered *gōngwūhuā* (unknown), *shéchuángzǐ* (cnidium seed), *chǔyè* (paper mulberry leaf), *wǔyèténg* (five-leaf vine), *lángdú* (wolfsbane), and *hànlián* (eclipta) onto the mercury. When smoke rises, stir with a bamboo stick until it turns the color of house dust, then remove the bowl. Discard the medicinal ash, pour the mercury onto paper, and let it congeal into hard cinnabar sand. If not fully formed, repeat the process. Once congealed, shape into a single piece, then grind *wǔbèizǐ* powder and *báiméi* (white plum) pulp into a paste in a mortar. Coat the cinnabar sand, wrap it in cotton (not too tightly), and bind with thread. Place in a *báihǔchí* (white tiger pool) bowl and stir-fry until the cotton turns scorched yellow. Remove and apply *guòguān* (passing-barrier) medicine: *tiānnánxīng* (jack-in-the-pulpit), *bànxià* (pinellia), *wǔwèizǐ* (schisandra), *báifùzǐ* (white aconite), *shǔkuíhuā* (hollyhock flower), and *wǔbèizǐ* as the outer barrier. Alternatively, mix *shǔkuíhuā* and *wǔbèizǐ* with honey, coat the exterior, wrap in toilet-clay, dry thoroughly, and refine with three *jīn* of fire until red.\n\n**Method for Coating Mercury**\nPlace one *liǎng* of mercury in an oil-free pan, then lightly sprinkle *sānhuáng* (three yellows) powder over it. Use a chicken feather to evenly spread the *sānhuáng* powder across the mercury’s surface. Cover with a small dish, then seal the rim with a strip of damp paper to prevent air leakage. Place the pan in warm-and-cool ash fire. From *yín* (3–5 AM) to *mǎo* (5–7 AM), add warm-and-cool fire beneath the pan, keeping the ash fire at half-height. From *mǎo* to *chén* (7–9 AM), then *chén* to *sì* (9–11 AM), apply three *jīn* of strong fire to refine until glowing red. After a short while, remove and inspect: the dried mercury should resemble white alum, with golden flecks on the surface. Reheat in the furnace to remove blackness, then melt into an ingot. The resulting *nǚshí* (female stone) will be lustrous white when immersed in water. For larger batches, adjust the fire accordingly, following the same method. The above is transmitted by Master Liú Qì.\n\n**Method for Congealing Mercury Sand into a Casket**\nGrind five *liǎng* of mercury and half a *liǎng* of high-quality *báinǚshí* (white female stone) *xiàshuǐ* (water) into powder. Use a thick white bowl and a cast-iron pan. Place the mercury and *báinǚshí xiàshuǐ* in the pan, heat with warm-and-cool fire until the *xiàshuǐ* melts, then line the bowl with a piece of fine, well-scoured white silk. Pour the mixture into the bowl, and with your hands, gather the congealed portion. Wrap it in paper and hold it near the body to absorb warmth. Cover the residue with white alum, then nurture with a gentle fire for two seven-day periods. Use only three *liǎng* of charcoal fire daily for the first seven days, increasing to four *liǎng* thereafter—do not exceed this amount. After the second seven-day period, increase to five *liǎng* for the next four to five days. Once cooled, remove and refine in a crucible as usual. During the two seven-day nurturing periods, maintain a soft fire. This method is so secret that even father and son do not transmit it; if carelessly shared, ten generations will be left without hands or feet. Keep this formula on your person, and at the time of death, secretly entrust it to a close relative. After passing, have the cinnabar casket cast into a long-flowing river—do not let it fall into the wrong hands. Perform this process no more than twice a month; do not overdo it. Beware, beware.\n\n**Master Gé’s *Purple Empyrean Elixir Canon* Method**\n**Method for Subduing Fire with Sulfur**\nObtain one *jīn* of sulfur from a foreign ship or monk’s robe. Grind it to powder and spread evenly in a flat-bottomed pan. Use rain-soaked mulberry branch ash lye—clarified and strong—for best results. Pour three *dǒu* of the lye over the sulfur to a depth of two fingers, then boil for one *fúshí* (twelve hours), stirring frequently to ensure evenness. Test a small amount over fire: if it subdues without igniting, it is ready; if not, add more lye and continue boiling until subdued. The sulfur should turn black as lacquer. Melt in a crucible with three to five *jīn* of charcoal fire, then pour into molds to form ingots. Later, crush, wash, dry, and grind into powder. Refine and cast into vessels, or use for medicinal purposes.\n\n**Master Sūn’s *Elixir Canon* Method for Subduing Sulfur**\nGrind one *liǎng* of sulfur, one *liǎng* of saltpeter, and half a *liǎng* of *lúshā* (sal ammoniac) into powder. Melt in a crucible, then pour into a mold to subdue.\n\n**Huáng Sānguān’s Method for Subduing Sulfur**\nTake four *liǎng* each of sulfur, *tānshí* (alumstone), and white alum. Mix half a bowl of fresh ginger juice with half a bowl of whetstone water, then soak five *dìng* of *zàojiǎo* (Chinese honey locust) to extract half a bowl of juice. Dissolve the three ingredients in this liquid until it reaches a thin consistency. Heat in an iron vessel over fire until dry, then scrape the powder into a casket and nurture for three seven-day periods.\n\n**Method for Subduing Fire with Sulfur**\nGrind two *liǎng* each of sulfur and saltpeter. Place the ingredients in a silver-melting pot or clay jar, then dig a pit in the ground and set the vessel inside, level with the surface. Pack soil tightly around it. Burn three undamaged *zàojiǎo* seeds until charred, then drop them in one by one. When the flames subside, place three *jīn* of raw and cooked charcoal around the mouth and refine.\n\nWhen one-third of the charcoal has burned away, remove the remaining fire and do not allow it to cool before retrieval—thus is the fire subdued.\n\n**Master Ge’s Alchemical Canon: Method for Subduing Realgar**\nOn the seventh day of the seventh lunar month, gather mulberry leaves in any quantity and dry them in the shade. For every *liǎng* of powdered mulberry leaves, add one *liǎng* of realgar. Place them in a ceramic vessel, layering mulberry leaves on top and bottom with realgar in the center, then seal tightly. Refine with ten *jīn* of honey and charcoal fire until stabilized. To convert it into powder, proceed in the same manner. For medicinal use, melt one *liǎng* of yellow wax with seven *gāngzǐ* (croton seeds), grind into a ball, and coat with one *liǎng* of mercury. Secure it to the navel with an adhesive; itching will occur within a day or two. After six years, the mercury hardens and becomes unusable.\n\n**Great Void Alchemical Canon: Method for Subduing Realgar**\nGrind realgar into fine powder. Mix with refined honey to the consistency of edible maltose, wrap tightly in several layers of coarse paper, and bind securely with silk thread. Boil a pot of water until rolling, then suspend the packet inside without touching the bottom. Continuously add boiling water to prevent cooling; use approximately one *yán* of water. Remove and grind in an iron mortar until extremely fine. Form into millet-sized pills with glutinous rice porridge water, and take one pill on an empty stomach with warm wine.\n\n**Master Ge’s Alchemical Canon: Method for Subduing Orpiment**\nUse orpiment in any quantity, layering subdued sal ammoniac on the bottom and top. Add borax the size of a *zàojiǎo* seed; for every *liǎng* of lead, it will be complete.\n\n**Master Sun’s Alchemical Canon: Method for Subduing Fire in Orpiment**\nTake half a *liǎng* of leaf orpiment and two *liǎng* of sal ammoniac, grind into fine powder. Mix evenly with egg white, fill into an eggshell, and seal the opening with paper. Then, grind one *liǎng* of white alum into powder, mix with egg white, and coat the shell; dry over fire. Next, grind one *liǎng* of saltpeter into fine powder, mix with egg white, and coat the shell; dry again. Finally, place one *jīn* of red lead in a vessel, set the orpiment and sal ammoniac inside, cover with red lead to form a casket, and seal with salt-clay. Dry, then refine with half a *chèng* of charcoal fire. Remove when complete. To use, melt cinnabar and mercury into a liquid, add one pill of the medicine, and form into water-chestnut-sized pills with yellow wax.\n\n**Methods for Subduing the Eight Minerals**\n\n**Master Ge’s Alchemical Canon: Method for Subduing Chalcanthite**\nTake one *liǎng* of chalcanthite and four *liǎng* of subdued sal ammoniac. Place in a sealed vessel and refine with three *jīn* of charcoal fire until red-hot. Use charcoal to form a pit, place the chalcanthite in the center, cover with sal ammoniac, and encase in a salt casket. Alternatively, nurture for one day before refining with three *jīn* of fire.\n\n**Master Sun’s Alchemical Canon: Method for Subduing Chalcanthite**\nGrind equal parts chalcanthite and green alum into powder, then refine with intense fire until molten.\n\n**Method for Dead Chalcanthite**\nExtract juice from hibiscus leaves and boil dry in a bowl with fresh ginger juice. Use a pot previously fumigated with a piece of frankincense, wrap the chalcanthite in paper, place it inside, and refine until molten. Pour onto a hot iron plate; the chalcanthite is thus rendered inert.\n\n**Method for Subduing Arsenic**\nGrind saltpeter and white alum into fine powder, layering them on the bottom and top. Place arsenic in the center within a crucible, seal with *báihǔfěng* (white tiger powder), and refine until red-hot. Remove and cast into ingots.\n\n**Method for Dead Arsenic**\nTake three *liǎng* of arsenic, six *qián* of cinnabar, six *qián* of *fěnshuāng* (calomel), and any quantity of saltpeter and alum to fill a vessel. Use a ceramic container, first lining the bottom with half a layer of saltpeter, then placing three *liǎng* of arsenic inside. Cover with half the remaining medicine, then layer alum, and finally fill the vessel with saltpeter. Seal with salt-clay, bind with hemp fibers, and seal again with salt-clay. Once dry, place in a casket and refine daily with one *jīn* of fire for three days. When removed, it will appear frosty white—thus is the arsenic rendered inert.\n\n**Method for Subduing Arsenolite (Tai Shang’s White Ying Elixir)**\nGrind half a *liǎng* of saltpeter and one *liǎng* of arsenolite into fine powder. Place in an oiled ceramic jar and stir-fry, adding two *liǎng* of white ash powder. Refine with four *jīn* of charcoal fire until the ash cools. Remove; it will be as white as snow. For every three *qián* of this powder, add two *qián* of white wax, mix with water, and form into millet-sized pills. Take one pill with freshly drawn water to treat malaria and dysentery.\n\n**Great Void Alchemical Canon: Method for Subduing Sulfur**\nGrind two *liǎng* of sulfur, two *liǎng* of saltpeter, and three *qián* of sal ammoniac into fine powder. Place in a large ingot pot and sprinkle with *fēnghuà báihǔ* (weathered white tiger powder) to fill the vessel without pressing down. Mix oyster shell powder with vinegar and coat the pot to a thickness of two fingers. Place the pot on the ground, arrange charcoal around it at a distance of four fingers, stacking it one *chǐ* high. Ignite three *jīn* of fire from the top, reducing to two *jīn* as it burns. When cool, retrieve the arsenolite from the center, which will resemble jade. Soak in fine water, then form into millet-sized pills with steamed cake. Take one pill on an empty stomach with cold water. It may be incorporated into various medicines and is particularly effective for treating deep-seated cold and hernia in men and women. For transmutation, its effects are extraordinary.\n\n**Method for Subduing Jade-like Arsenolite**\nTrue *shínǎoyóu* (naphtha) will spread upon contact with hair, curl upon touching the tongue, and not stain clothing. Grind four *liǎng* of jade-colored arsenolite into fine powder, mix with one *liǎng* of naphtha and one *liǎng* of fresh ginger juice, and blend evenly with the arsenolite powder to form a stiff dough. Place in a small ceramic vessel, first coating the interior with ginger juice. Do not cover; instead, expose the opening and apply gentle heat from all sides to eliminate yin qi. Once dry, remove and grind again.\n\nAgain mix with ginger juice to a dough-like consistency, return to the vessel, and apply gentle heat until dry. Repeat this process five times, then grind evenly with one *liǎng* of fine saltpeter. Next, take an unworked iron crucible with a three-*shēng* capacity, boil one *liǎng* of fresh ginger and yellow earth within it. Sift the earth to a fine, moist consistency, and pack it firmly to just below the crucible’s rim. Carve a depression in the earth, about one *cùn* from the crucible’s edge. Within this depression, fill and pack *fēnghuà* (weathered) fine white tiger powder to the brim. At the center of the white tiger powder, carve a small depression and embed the arsenolite vessel within, packing it firmly. Cover it again with white tiger powder. Then, take one *jīn* of walnut meat, break into small pieces, and arrange atop the white tiger powder. Seal the crucible’s rim with a mixture of yellow earth, paper fiber, and mud, then invert a ceramic bowl over the opening, ensuring a tight seal. Coat the entire exterior of the crucible with salt-clay to a thickness of half a finger, extending downward to just below the rim, and dry over heat. Fill the bowl with eight parts of fermented water. Place the crucible on a dry patch of ground atop a three-legged stand, and apply five *jīn* of fire until the crucible glows red throughout. Cease heating and allow it to cool naturally. Upon opening, the arsenolite will have fused into a single mass, clear as crystal, luminous in sunlight—a supreme elixir for the five metals and a master key for the eight minerals. All methods under heaven emerge from this single furnace, its wonders beyond compare. Guard this secret, guard it well.\n\n**Method for Subduing Sal Ammoniac from the Alchemical Classic of Immortal Ge**\n\n**Method for Subduing Sal Ammoniac with Pomegranate:**\nTake two *liǎng* of sal ammoniac, boil it in the juice of sour pomegranate pulp and seeds until reduced by half, then use again. Burn the residue to ash, leach with water, and evaporate to frost. Scrape into a lidded vessel, seal tightly, and calcine with fire to subdue it. During boiling, add five *liǎng* of powdered *wǔyècǎo* (a herb with long, angular leaves resembling water caltrop, its stems bearing purple markings; abundant in western Sichuan). If unavailable, use pomegranate leaves alone, boiled in wood-ash lye within a ceramic vessel. After two subduing cycles, dry it, scrape into a lidded vessel, seal tightly, and dry thoroughly to expel all yin *qi*. Calcine with seven *jīn* of fire, then remove when cool.\n\n**Method for Subduing Sal Ammoniac:**\nLine the bottom and cover the top with saltpeter, seal with mud, and burn to subdue the fire. After boiling the sal ammoniac in ash lye, nourish it with *chǔ* leaves and silkworm droppings over fire, then dissolve in hot water, leach, and calcine until red—this yields an even finer result.\n\n**Method for Subduing Fire in Sal Ammoniac:**\nTake one *liǎng* of sal ammoniac, and half a *liǎng* each of oyster shell, cuttlebone, and clamshell (if any ingredient is lacking, substitute with subdued alum). Grind all into fine powder, heat a crucible until glowing red, and gradually add the mixture. Once subdued to ash, remove, grind again, and leach the liquid into a ceramic vessel. When nearly dry, transfer to a crucible, heat until molten, and it will resemble snow.\n\n**Method for Subduing Fire in Sal Ammoniac:**\nTake one *liǎng* of sal ammoniac and one *liǎng* of cuttlebone, grind together, and heat a crucible until red-hot. Melt the mixture into a liquid, remove, and cool. Grind finely, steep in boiling water, leach the liquid, and evaporate to frost. Re-calcine. Use powdered *chǔ* seeds and late silkworm droppings: first line half the powder in a crucible, tamp firmly, then place two layers of black paper. Add the sal ammoniac, cover with two more layers of black paper, and top with the remaining powder, tamped firmly. Do not seal tightly. Calcine with four *jīn* of fire until exhausted, then remove when cool—the fire will be subdued.\n\n**Method for Subduing Alum from the Alchemical Classic of Immortal Ge:**\nTake one *liǎng* of fine white alum, crush into pieces the size of soap beans. Use five *liǎng* of *dìjǐncǎo* (if unavailable, substitute with selfheal). Mix with yellow clay, paper fiber, and mud to a proper consistency. Seal a well-oiled ceramic vessel capable of holding the mixture with this mud, about half a *cùn* thick. When dry, place a half-brick on the ground, further sealing the base and sides. Gradually heat with charcoal until the mixture melts into a liquid, stir evenly with a willow branch, and continue for the time it takes to brew one or two cups of tea. Then gradually withdraw the fire and allow to cool. Break the vessel to retrieve the powder. Line the top and bottom with two *liǎng* of tung seeds, evenly distributed, with cinnabar in between, filling the vessel completely. Seal the seams with red halloysite and mud, securing with two iron rods in a cross. Use three *liǎng* of talc, two *liǎng* of charcoal, a small amount of white clay, and saltwater-soaked paper mud to seal the lidded vessel. Dry in a pit, then nourish with half a *jīn* of fire for twenty-one days. Later, add another half *jīn* of fire and nourish for forty-nine days. Once the cycle is complete, grind into powder and form into mung-bean-sized pills with glutinous rice porridge. One pill will transmute one *liǎng* of mercury into treasure.\n\n**Method for Refining Bronze:**\nTake equal parts of powdered chalcanthite, melanterite, and green vitriol. Beat refined copper into thin sheets, mix the powdered ingredients with vinegar to a paste-like consistency, and apply to the copper. Seal with powdered red halloysite mixed with cow dung, dry in the shade, and heat with gentle and strong fire for three cycles. Then place in a crucible, melt into a liquid, and it will become a precious metal of fine quality.\n\n**Method for the Longevity Vault:**\nTake a porcelain vessel from Dingzhou and seal it with Six-One Mud. Use one *liǎng* each of raw mercury and cinnabar, and one *liǎng* of raw silver powder. First place the mercury, then layer the cinnabar to press the mercury, alternating with silver powder until all is used. Seal tightly, then place in a small furnace. Arrange charcoal of sorghum-stalk length around the vessel, one *liǎng* of fire on each of the four sides, forming four pillars of charcoal. Nourish for seven days and nights. When the time is complete, calcine with one *jīn* of fire. Remove the contents, place back into the vessel, and add two *liǎng* of raw mercury. Repeat the charcoal arrangement and nourish for seven days. Add another two *liǎng* of mercury as before, nourish for seven days, then retrieve and refine into treasure. Add two *liǎng* of mercury again, completing the seven-day fire cycle. By repeatedly adding two *liǎng* of mercury, the process becomes everlasting.\n\n*End of Scroll Five of Various Schools’ Divine Elixir Methods*\n*Scroll Six of Various Schools’ Divine Elixir Methods*\n\n**Sunflower Master’s Method for Transmuting Metal into Gold**\nTake one *jīn* of hundred-times-refined red copper and one *jīn* of Taiyuan furnace *gānshr̀i* (calamine). Grind one *liǎng* of the stone to a fine powder, sift with water, and mix evenly. Place in an iron vessel, seal tightly, and dry in the shade. Use eight *jīn* of charcoal in a wind furnace, beginning at the *chén* hour (7–9 a.m.), and fire continuously for two days and nights. Allow to cool, then transfer to a *qì* furnace for calcination, vigorously fanning for three hours before removal. Open the vessel, wash away the mud and water, and the resulting granules will resemble the color of a rooster’s comb. One *qián* of this mother-tincture transmutes one *liǎng* of base gold into superior gold.\n\nAlternatively, take one *liǎng* each of gold and mercury, combine to form cinnabar sand, then layer with *qīngyán* (halite) and *zhōnghuáng* (yellow earth from stone) as base and cover, sealing in a *dǎnfán* (chalcanthite) vessel. Employ the water-and-fire-balanced crucible, begin firing at the *chén* hour, and after three days and nights, the process yields wondrous results.\n\n**The Poor Woman’s Method for Transmuting Metal into Gold**\nGrind one *liǎng* of mercury with fifty sheets of gold leaf into a paste. Extract one large cup of juice from *gōngwūwěi* (a plant, likely *Polygonatum* or *Dioscorea*) by pressing, then boil the mercury in an oil-free pan until the juice evaporates. Wring the mercury through silk fabric to form cinnabar sand. Repeat the boiling and wringing until all mercury is converted to sand.\n\nMix four *liǎng* of *huángdān* (lead oxide) with *báihǔ* (white tiger, likely a mineral) powder, moistened with vinegar, and pound evenly in a mortar. Wrap the cinnabar sand in three to five layers of black paper, encase it in the *báihǔ* mixture, and shape into cakes. Seal the exterior with salt-clay to a thickness of one *cùn*, then dry in the shade. Calcine until glowing red, allow to cool, and use for transmutation as desired. If gold leaf is unavailable, half a *qián* of \"horse’s son\" (a substitute) works equally well. This method should be kept secret.\n\n**The Four-Spirit Metal-Enveloping Method**\nOne *liǎng* of raw silver, half a *liǎng* of gold,\nEqual weights of *jiěyán* (halite) and *qīngdǎn* (blue vitriol),\nAdd half a *liǎng* of *quèshā* (realgar) and sulfur,\nEnvelop to form a single piece of purple gold treasure.\n\n*Chà Nǚ Jīn* (Marvelous Woman’s Gold) is produced by enveloping with *jiěyán*, *dǎnfán*, *quèshā*, sulfur, and *gāncǎo* (licorice).\n\n**Method for Enveloping Cinnabar to Produce Gold**\nTake five *liǎng* of high-quality, granular cinnabar. Wrap each piece in five layers of gold leaf and embed in the medicinal mixture. Envelop for one *fú* (a period of time, likely a day) with half a *jīn* of fire, gradually increasing to three *jīn*. Calcine until glowing red, then allow to cool. The resulting substance will not diminish and may be used freely.\n\n**Method from the *Tai Xu Dan Jing* for Enveloping Gold in the Azure Oil Pool**\nTake seven *qián* of *lǜfán* (green vitriol), four *liǎng* of *báifán* (white alum), and one and a half *liǎng* of *qīngyuán* (azure salt). Flatten one *liǎng* of base gold into sheets. In a new porcelain vessel, first sprinkle one *liǎng* of the medicinal mixture, place the gold sheets inside, then cover with another *liǎng* of the mixture. Seal tightly and calcine for one hour. Remove and soak in a solution to deepen the color.\n\n**Method for Enveloping Gold**\nTake one and a half *liǎng* of *jiěyán*, one *liǎng* and three *qián* of *dǎnfán*, four *qián* of *báifán*, seven and a half *qián* of *qīngyán*, two and a half *qián* of *yànhāo* (saltpeter), and half a *qián* of *shínǎoyóu* (naphtha). Grind these six ingredients into a fine powder. If *shínǎoyóu* is unavailable, substitute two *qián* of calcined *shā* (cinnabar) for the inner envelope.\n\nAdditionally, grind four *liǎng* of *xuánkuì* (likely a mineral or plant ash) with one *liǎng* of *jiěyán* into a fine powder. For enveloping, use a separate porcelain dish. First, layer the dish three to five times with the *xuánkuì* mixture, forming a nest. Then, add the inner-envelope medicine three to five times within the nest. Place the gold inside, cover with the inner-envelope medicine, and seal with a tile. Secure with an iron wire in a cross pattern, then seal with salt-clay to a thickness of one finger. Allow to dry, place on level ground, and surround with ash. For ten *liǎng* of gold, use twenty *jīn* of fire; for five to seven *liǎng*, use one *chèng* (a unit of weight) of fire; for three to five *liǎng*, use ten *jīn* of fire; and for one to two *liǎng*, use five *jīn* of fire. Once the fire has consumed all fuel, allow to cool, then remove. If the color has transformed into purple gold, place back into the pot to eliminate any residual smoke. No harm will come to the gold.\n\n**Effortless and Marvelous Method for Enveloping Gold**\nFor each *liǎng* of gold, take half a *liǎng* of *báishízhī* (white halloysite), half a *liǎng* of white clay, one and a half *qián* of *báifán*, four *qián* of salt, three *qián* of *dàizhěshí* (hematite), half a *liǎng* of *huángfán* (yellow vitriol), and half a *qián* of calcined *shā*. Use the whitest white clay available.\n\nGrind the ingredients into a fine powder and place in a small porcelain jar. Sprinkle one *qián* of *dàizhěshí* powder at the bottom, then add half of the remaining medicine. Place the gold inside, cover with the other half of the medicine, and seal the jar’s mouth with a tile. Use three to five *jīn* of charcoal fire; the duration of firing is flexible, though in winter, half a day suffices. For larger quantities of gold, use a deeper porcelain jar. If using old hairpins or bracelets, first fire them once or twice to remove impurities and grease before applying the medicine. Only one firing is needed; retain the residual medicine from the fire for use as a cover in subsequent firings.\n\n**Fire-Taming Cinnabar and Spring-Chanting Method**\nTake one and a half *liǎng* of silver and three *liǎng* of high-quality cinnabar, cut into dice-sized pieces. First, coat the cinnabar with honey, then boil with half a *liǎng* of calcined *shā* in water for three *fú*. Grind the cinnabar finely, leaving the dice-sized pieces unground. Add a small amount of mercury and mix with *qínfán* (alum), then combine with the cinnabar pieces.\n\nPrepare silver powder by grinding one sheet of heavy paper with one *qián* of ink, then mixing with honey. Spread the mixture evenly on the paper and allow to dry. Wrap the cinnabar pieces in the paper, securing with thread. Mix yellow clay with oil to form a paste, then wrap the paper-wrapped cinnabar in a ball of uniform thickness, approximately one finger’s width, ensuring no cracks. Place on a gentle fire to expel all moisture, then transfer to an oiled porcelain vessel. Layer with one *jīn* of *qīngyuán*, using half to line the bottom and half to cover the top. Seal tightly and place in a pit lined with ash. Typically, use half a *jīn* of fire, maintaining it continuously for seven days. Then, add two *jīn* of fire and nourish for one more night.\n\nRemove the fire and open the vessel to collect the salt flowers. Break open the ball and retrieve the cinnabar, which will resemble black tin. Place it again in a crucible, melt into liquid, and pour into an ingot mold, yielding a total of four and a half *liǎng*. Grind into powder with iron filings.\n\nTake six *liǎng* of raw cinnabar, the size of dice, and grind evenly with the fire-tamed cinnabar. Then place in the vessel, lining the bottom and covering the top with salt flowers. Seal tightly and set in the ash pit, continuously nourishing with four *liǎng* of fire for a full seven days. Add two *jīn* of fire and nourish for one more night. Remove the fire, allow to cool, and retrieve the product as high-grade silver.\n\nSet aside one and a half *liǎng* for use, then take another one and a half *liǎng* of raw silver and mix with two *liǎng* of cinnabar. Grind the silver filings and cinnabar together evenly, then place in the vessel as before. Seal and nourish for seven days, adding two *jīn* of fire. Fire for one more night, then retrieve.\n\nAgain, set aside one and a half *liǎng* for use, retaining one and a half *liǎng* as the base to continuously replenish with cinnabar for further firing. If no continuous replenishment is desired, up to twenty *liǎng* may be made. Cast into a tripod vessel the size of a chicken egg. Place the tripod in a bed of well-charred ash fire, then add two *liǎng* of mercury into the tripod. Cover the opening with three layers of damp paper, then seal with an inverted porcelain bowl. Gradually increase the fire and heat for one *shí* (two hours), whereupon the mercury will transform into silver. Then, following the previous method, nourish with two *jīn* of fire continuously for one *fúshí* (twelve hours). Allow to cool, retrieve, and shape as desired.\n\nThereafter, maintain two *liǎng* of mercury in the tripod to continuously produce silver—hence the name \"Gushing Spring Method.\" The newly prepared cinnabar must first be treated: take half a *liǎng* of roasted cinnabar, dissolve in water and boil, then mix a small amount with alum and stir thoroughly before use. Such meticulous preparation is the key to its efficacy.\n\n**Method for Harmonizing Silver with the Mother (Alloying Process)**\nMother (base metal): five *qián*; mercury: six *qián*. Clean with hot pepper water, then boil in one *shēng* of rice vinegar with half a *liǎng* of white alum, three *qián* each of Sichuan pepper and lotus leaves, and two *qián* of *Aconitum* (monkshood). Suspend and boil until the vinegar is fully evaporated. The cinnabar will harden like iron. Remove, wrap in three layers of black paper, and press against the body to tame.\n\nGrind equal parts of borax, chalcanthite, roasted alum, and salt-fried *qīngyuán* into powder. First, mix three *qián* of clear honey with half a *liǎng* of the powder and apply to the body. Then wrap in two layers of *Kunlun* paper, cutting the paper into six-petal flower shapes and pasting them securely. Next, mix five倍子 powder with vinegar and wrap one or two more layers. Use one *liǎng* of the powder to coat the exterior until fully covered, then wrap again with *Kunlun* paper as before.\n\nGrind one *qián* each of *Anemarrhena*, *Fritillaria*, *Angelica dahurica*, *Epimedium*, *Glechoma*, *Aconitum*, and *Dioscorea bulbifera* into powder, mix with vinegar, and wrap. Then wrap once more with *Kunlun* paper. Mix half a *liǎng* of salt with two *liǎng* of white ants and one *qiān* of *Qianliji* (a medicinal herb), grind into a paste, and seal the exterior. Place in ash fire to bake, applying three to four *liǎng* of fire while frequently turning. When dry, retrieve and patch any cracks. Return to the ash fire and bake for one to two *shíchén* (two to four hours), then evenly surround with five *jīn* of mature fire and heat to completion.\n\nRetrieve while still attached to the body. Do not remove from the furnace; first prepare a fire scale of six *jīn* and construct a brick furnace. Ignite the fire and heat the furnace thoroughly.\n\n**Golden Elixir Method**\nOne *jīn* of refined sulfur, translucent and ground to fine powder.\nTwo *liǎng* of *shanchishi* (mountain saltpeter), finely ground.\nThree *liǎng* of fire-tamed *beiting* (a type of salt) solution.\n\nCombine these three ingredients evenly. Take an iron vessel, grind high-quality ink with rice vinegar, and thickly coat the interior three times. Allow to dry, then place the three ingredients inside. Apply gentle and strong fire alternately to heat until the medicine melts into liquid, expelling all *beiting* yin-qi. Cease firing and allow to cool.\n\nAdd four *liǎng* of saltpeter, finely ground to powder, filling the vessel completely and pressing firmly. Seal the vessel’s opening with dry paper. Once dry, place in a tripod and seal with *fa-ni* (method clay). The *fa-ni* is made from *yangmen daizheshi* (hematite resembling a rooster’s comb), left-coiling oyster shell, and *chishizhi* (red halloysite), ground to fine powder in equal parts. Mix with *beiting* solution, knead in a mortar for over a thousand strokes, then use to seal the vessel and its base thoroughly, ensuring tightness.\n\nSecure the tripod’s lid with an iron lock, ensuring it is tightly sealed. Allow to dry, then take three *jīn* of lead and melt in a crucible. Use a small iron ladle to scoop the molten lead and evenly coat the vessel’s exterior. Gradually pour the lead liquid into the tripod until it reaches two *cùn* above the vessel’s opening.\n\nSelect an auspicious day and begin firing at midnight (the *zǐ* hour). Start with six *liǎng* of fire, increasing by one *liǎng* each day until the sixth day. When the tripod has cooled completely, use a small iron chisel to remove the blackened exterior, open the vessel, and retrieve the medicine—now the color of true gold. Grind finely in a mortar for use.\n\n**Method for Refining Silver Powder**\nTen *liǎng* of high-quality silver and fifty *liǎng* of mercury, stored in a jar and kept warm over a constant fire. Heat the silver until red-hot, then immerse in the mercury, stirring with a willow spatula until fully dissolved.\n\nGrind three *jīn* of salt with the silver amalgam until fine, then place evenly in a large pot. Cover with a basin, sealing the edges tightly with clay. Heat gently to vaporize the mercury, continuing until the mercury is fully expelled. Dry the silver powder in the sun, then grind to a fine powder.\n\nEight *liǎng* of realgar, translucent and leaf-like, ground to powder.\nFour *liǎng* of halite, ground.\nTen *liǎng* of gold powder.\nEight *liǎng* of orpiment, ground to powder and resembling a rooster’s comb for best quality.\n\n**The Five Ingredients Above**\nGrind all five ingredients to a fine powder. Prepare another crucible and, following the previous method, grind thick ink with rice vinegar and evenly coat the interior of the crucible. Then, apply gentle and strong fire alternately to the crucible, causing the ingredients to melt into a liquid, as before.\n\nFour *liǎng* of saltpeter, ground to powder, packed tightly into the base of the crucible, and sealed with layers of fine paper and paste. Secure the crucible’s lid and seal the base with clay, then place it inside the furnace. Seal the base with clay as before, fasten it with an iron lock, and allow it to dry in the shade, following the previous method.\n\nFirst, take three *jīn* of lead and melt it in a vessel until liquid. Using a ladle, pour the lead into the crucible’s base, filling it gradually from all sides until the lead reaches two *cùn* above the crucible. Proceed as before.\n\nChoose an auspicious day and begin firing at midnight during the *zǐ* hour. Start with six *liǎng* of fuel, increasing by one *liǎng* each day until sixty days are complete. Once cooled, chip away the black lead to retrieve the crucible—the elixir within should appear as purple gold.\n\nGrind one *fēn* of this elixir finely in a mortar; it can transmute one *jīn* of mercury into polished purple gold. This is not of the mortal world but a secret transmission from the immortals. For those who seek the Dao, let this be sufficient.\n\n**Method for Subduing Fire with Northern Hall Sand**\n\nTake three *liǎng* of clear Northern Hall cinnabar and mix it evenly with one and a half *fēn* of melted yellow wax to form a ball, then wrap it in paper.\n\nTake one *dǒu* of slaked lime, place half in a porcelain jar, and pack it tightly. Scoop out a hollow in the center and place the Northern Hall cinnabar ball inside. Cover with the remaining lime and pack tightly as before.\n\nBegin with three *jīn* of fuel, gradually increasing to five or seven *jīn* over three *fú* periods, then use ten *jīn* of fire to calcine until red-hot. Once cooled, remove and place in a raw silk bag.\n\nDig a pit large enough to hold five to seven *shēng* of water, ensuring it is fully saturated. Place a fine porcelain bowl inside, lay a stick across it, and suspend the cinnabar bag above the bowl. Cover with a basin, seal the edges with damp earth to prevent air leakage, and leave for three *fú* periods until it liquefies. Mix this liquid with the aforementioned two ingredients.\n\n**Method for Subduing the Elixir and Transmuting Mercury into Metal (Gēng Method)**\n\nFor each *jīn* of mercury, use one *fēn* of the elixir. Place the elixir atop the mercury in a new iron crucible, cover with a tea bowl, and seal properly. Set over a fire and listen for the sound of dripping within. Plunge the crucible into water to quench, repeating this ten or more times until the mercury is subdued, appearing like black sand. Transfer to a crucible and melt—it will become polished purple gold. Its transformations are too numerous to record fully.\n\n**Divine Immortal’s Gold-Refining Elixir (Also Called Bone-Transforming Elixir)**\n\nTake five *liǎng* each of *fěnshuāng* and arsenic, refined nine times by sublimation. If sublimation is not possible, calcine with fire instead.\n\nGrind the two ingredients together until they can be formed into balls, then dry them. Add one *liǎng* each of Northern Hall cinnabar, saltpeter, white alum, *tàiyīn xuánjīng*, and *shíyán huā* (red alum for the alum stone).\n\nTake a sealed crucible and pack three to four *liǎng* of *yánhūa* tightly at the bottom. Place the *fěnshuāng*-arsenic ball inside, then layer the Northern Hall cinnabar and other ingredients, adding more *yánhūa* and packing tightly. If the crucible is not full, fill it with *yánhūa*. Seal properly, ensuring no cracks, and dry thoroughly before placing it in the furnace.\n\nLine the furnace bottom with one *jīn* of lead, set the crucible on top, and secure it with iron rods. Melt additional lead and pour it in until it submerges the crucible by three *cùn*. Bury in ash, cover, and maintain a gentle fire to keep the lead soft. After sixty days and nights, increase the fire above and below the furnace until it glows red-hot. After one day, allow it to cool, then reheat the furnace to melt the lead and remove the crucible. Break it open, discard the residue, and retrieve the two elixir ingredients—now a delightful chicken-yellow color. Grind finely and form into rice-sized pills with glutinous rice. Each pill can transmute one *liǎng* of mercury into treasure. For consumption, take one pill on an empty stomach with tea or wine to replenish *qi*, warm the kidneys, and yield divine effects too profound to describe.\n\n**Method for Subduing Fire with Divine Brocade Cinnabar**\n\nTake sixty-four *liǎng* of *shānzé* (mountain marsh ore), hammer into thin sheets, and cut into chess-piece shapes.\n\nTake one *jīn* of granular cinnabar, refine it using the *xuántāi* method, and dry. Roll the cinnabar in *bǎihuā ruǐ* (hundred-flower pollen), coat with the body-binding elixir, wrap each piece in silk, and dry in sunlight.\n\nStore in a porcelain container and nurture with fire for one month, gradually increasing the heat. Then place the refined divine cinnabar in a water-fire crucible, pour in two *liǎng* of *yīn*-refined mercury, seal, and fire for two days and nights until the process is complete. Allow to cool, then open as in the subduing-fire method. Add another two *liǎng* of mercury and repeat the firing if necessary, up to a total of three *jīn* of mercury. Melt in a crucible to form treasure.\n\n**Xuántāi (Suspended Womb) Method**\n\nPlace the divine cinnabar in a cloth bag. In a new sand pot, add ten bottles of vinegar and one and a half *liǎng* of white sulfur. Suspend the bag above the pot with an iron rod, ensuring it does not touch the bottom. Heat gently until the vinegar evaporates, then dry. Coat the cinnabar with refined *bǎihuā* elixir, then dust with a fine powder of *xī péngshā* (western borax), *qiān bái shuāng* (lead white frost), and white alum. Wrap in silk, dry in sunlight, and store in a sealed container.\n\n**Sealed Container Method**\n\nHammer *shānzé* into silver sheets and cut into small chess-piece shapes. Mix half with vinegar and tamp into a porcelain container. Arrange the cinnabar as if planting lotus seeds, ensuring no contact. Cover with the remaining silver sheets, then seal the seams with a mixture of *hánshuǐshí* (cold-water stone) and white alum. Secure with iron wire in a cross pattern, then seal with *guànní* (washbasin mud).\n\nDry, then place in a furnace ash pit. Use a clay pot large enough to hold one *dǒu* and five *shēng*. Place a three-legged stand inside, set the container on top, and sift ten thousand coins’ worth of ash to fill one *dǒu* and two *shēng*, leaving two *liǎng* at the top. Begin with gentle fire at the *mǎo* hour, add another round at the *shēn* hour, and regulate the heat evenly without interruption. Nurture for one month until the cinnabar hardens, then transfer to a water-fire crucible.\n\n**Water-Fire Crucible Method**\n\nUse an iron crucible six to seven *cùn* tall. Place the cinnabar inside, pour two *liǎng* of *hài*-refined mercury over it, and cover with an iron lid secured tightly with iron wire. Seal properly, then add warm water to the lid. Apply fire as follows:\n\n**Fire Regulation Method**\n\nBegin gently and gradually increase the heat, firing for two days and nights until complete. Allow to cool, then open the crucible as in the subduing-fire method.\n\nOnce again pour two *liǎng* of mercury. If not yet fired, continue until three *jīn* of charcoal are consumed, at which point the mercury will be exhausted. Should one wish to form the substance, let the fumes disperse until it liquefies—mercury thus becomes the supreme treasure.\n\n**Divine Immortal’s Art for Saving the World**\nTake four *liǎng* of arsenic trioxide, the whitest being best. Add one *liǎng* of *fěnshuāng*, five *qián* of mother-of-mercury powder, and five *qián* of mercury. Grind the above ingredients together until no specks remain.\n\nPlace them in a porcelain crucible, seal with a one-*cùn* layer of salt-clay, and let dry in the shade. Coat the interior of the crucible with raw mercury, then add the prepared medicine. Take half a *liǎng* of sublimed alum and one *liǎng* of *hánshuǐshí*, grind finely, mix with vinegar, and seal the crucible’s seams. Apply another layer of salt-clay. Once dry, place the crucible in the furnace.\n\nFirst surround it with three to five *jīn* of matured charcoal. Begin firing at the *yín* hour, gradually increasing the heat until the *mǎo* hour, using one and a half *chèng* of charcoal. Cease firing and allow to cool. Open the crucible and remove the medicine, then nurture it with the following *kuì* method.\n\n**Kuì-Nurturing Method**\nTake a white porcelain container, ensuring it has not been exposed to water. First use effloresced powder, then cold powder, to form a depression. Place the medicine inside. Layer above it first alum powder, then cold powder, then effloresced powder, filling the container completely. Press firmly, cover with the original lid, and seal the seams with the same clay. Secure further with iron wire, then apply a thorough coating of *guàn* clay. Once dry, place in an ash pit and nurture with fire for seven days. Remove when complete.\n\nOne *liǎng* of *zhènmáo* can transmute one *qián* of medicine. Refine the three powders—alum, *hánshuǐshí*, and effloresced—by firing them again to ash.\n\n**Bá-Máo Method**\nCombine the ashes of mulberry, *yùnǚcǎo*, and *huīdíjī*, then leach to obtain the liquid. Add equal parts of *guālǒu*, *dǔyí*, and white *dīngxiāng* powder to the liquid. Place in a willow trough and press ten times—this yields a highly refined product, with one *jīn* producing ten *liǎng*.\n\n**Lead-Sand Method**\nTake one *liǎng* of divine sand and one *liǎng* of lead. First melt the lead into liquid, then add the divine sand powder to form sand. Proceed with the *yìn*-refining method.\n\n**Yìn-Refining Method**\nUse the ashes of *shèsōng*, duckweed, *jiàyìnǚ*, and mulberry leaves. Leach the above to obtain the liquid, repeating several times. Subject the prepared sand to *yìn*-refining for two days and nights. Wipe dry, then melt in a crucible. When melting, sprinkle equal parts of alum, saltpeter, and salt powder on top to form the liquid. Pour out to yield the treasure. Finally, place in the divine chamber—if not placed in the divine chamber, it remains unusable.\n\n**Separating the Embryo Method**\nUse soapberry powder, human hair, and saltpeter to skim and refine, producing a treasure of the highest grade. Alternatively, separation may be achieved using iron dross.\n\n**Four-Spirit Elixir Method**\nTake one *jīn* of divine sand, add four *liǎng* of realgar and two *liǎng* of sulfur. Grind to powder and refine for one day and night. Then place in a jar and fire again to form divine sand. Grind once more to fine powder, add four *liǎng* of orpiment, then refine for another day and night. Place in a jar and fire to form sand. Grind again, add four *liǎng* of cinnabar and one *liǎng* of sulfur powder, refine for one day and night, then place in a jar and fire to form sand. Grind finely—one *shī* can transmute ten thousand coins’ worth of *máo* into silver.\n\n**Three-Pair Adorning Jade Maiden’s Embryo-Entering Method**\nTake three *liǎng* each of silver and mercury. First melt the lead into liquid, then add the mercury and stir-fry until liquefied. Next, use the following ingredients: magnetite, Sichuan pepper, arsenolite, green salt, calcined alum, dried lotus root, and human hair—eight ingredients in equal parts. Grind to fine powder and add to the lead-mercury liquid repeatedly until the lead and mercury turn pure white. Then melt three *liǎng* of true silver into liquid, add the lead-mercury sand, and if smoke rises, add *xuánqīng* three to five times. Pour into an oil trough to yield a treasure of the highest grade.\n\n**Jade Maiden’s Embryo-Entering Method**\nTake three *liǎng* of true lead, hammer into thin sheets, and cut into pieces. Add three *liǎng* of mercury and one *shēng* of water, then boil. Use half a *liǎng* of alum and three *qián* of Sichuan pepper. Grind the above in a mortar until they form a clay-like paste, shaping into cherry-sized pills. Place in a cloth bag and boil in a bottle of good vinegar with alum and Sichuan pepper powder until the vinegar is exhausted. Remove the pills, soak the bag in cold water for one hour, then place in the *kuì*.\n\n**Kuì-Nurturing Method**\nTake four *liǎng* of sublimed arsenic trioxide, grind to fine powder, and place in a porcelain container, lining the bottom and covering the top. Place the pills inside. Seal the seams with red halloysite powder, ensuring even ventilation. Apply a one-finger-thick layer of salt-clay, dry over fire, then place in an ash pit and nurture with fire for seven days. When complete, test by biting—if no grass-like sound is heard, it is ready. If a grass-like sound remains, continue nurturing until it disappears. Remove all medicine, then melt two portions of sublimed arsenic trioxide into liquid. Toss the pills into the golden liquid and boil for the time it takes to cook a bowl of rice. Pour into an iron vessel, let cool, and remove the pills. Wash the pills thoroughly with warm water, then place in a clean pot and melt together. Pour into an oil trough to form the treasure. Each three *qián* can transmute seven *qián* of *máo* into silver.\n\n**Subliming Arsenic Trioxide Method**\nTake two *liǎng* of arsenic trioxide, four *liǎng* of saltpeter, five *qián* of alum, and five *qián* of *báihǔ*. Grind the four ingredients together to fine powder, place in a crucible, and seal the mouth with five to seven layers of damp paper, keeping the paper moist to prevent drying. Use five *jīn* of charcoal fire below, firing for half an hour until it liquefies. Pour into a vessel, let cool, and grind to fine powder—this serves as the lining and covering medicine for the previous process.\n\n**Condensing Mercury Method**\nTake four *liǎng* of alum oil and two *liǎng* of sublimed sulfur. First place two *liǎng* of alum oil in a pot, then add one *liǎng* of sulfur. Seal with salt-clay and fire the pot until it glows red throughout, naturally forming the *kuì*.\n\nThen remove and let cool. Add two *liǎng* of mercury, and place another two *liǎng* of sulfur on top. Cover with a layer of vinegar-soaked paper, then apply a mixture of yellow earth and vinegar, half-dry and half-moist, to an even consistency. Seal the paper with salt-clay and place in the furnace.\n\nFirst, arrange four ox-head crucibles with their openings facing upward, level and stable. Invert one crucible, cutting a small hole in its base, and place it atop the others to serve as a stable platform. Surround the crucible with a trench, filling it tightly with straw ash. The ash layer should be one *cùn* thick on the outer side. On the ash, nurture a slow fire of half a *jīn* of charcoal for seven days until the medicine forms, resembling *fùzǐ* or *gǒuzǐ* in shape, with a charred black surface.\n\nThen transfer the medicine to another crucible, heat intensely until it liquefies, and add a small amount of well salt. Once the salt is fully incorporated, pour the molten substance into a mold to form ingots. This medicine serves as the primary agent for refining white alum oil.\n\nGrind the white alum oil into fine powder, place it in a thick white porcelain bowl, and mix with rice vinegar to a consistency like thick paste. Gradually apply charcoal fire beneath, nurturing it for one to two meals’ time. When nearly dry, let it cool slightly, then remove onto paper and grind into powder for use as before.\n\n**Miscellaneous Methods**\n**Single-Body Method**\nTake one *liǎng* of fine silver powder and one *liǎng* of mercury, combine in a stone mortar, and pound three to five hundred times with the aforementioned medicine until it forms cinnabar sand. Filter through boiled silk, place in a stone pot, and mix with brine, white alum, and green salt, blending thoroughly with vinegar paste. Boil for three days and nights, then transfer to a salt crucible. Nurture with gentle and strong fire for one day, remove, and grind finely. Mix with one *liǎng* of *fěnshuāng*, return to the salt crucible, seal with brine-clay, and fire with horse-passing fire for seven days and nights without extinguishing the flame. Finally, refine with intense fire, let cool, and divide one *liǎng* of the medicine into three portions to transmute ten *liǎng* of base metal. Keep this secret.\n\n**Subduing Fire Borax Method**\nTake one *liǎng* of borax and one *liǎng* of *zhīmǔ*, grind to fine powder, and place a crucible over one *jīn* of charcoal fire. First, add half the *zhīmǔ* powder to the crucible and stir-fry until it turns to ash, then remove. Add the borax, and after a while, when it liquefies and boils over, press it down with the remaining *zhīmǔ* powder to naturally subdue the fire. Pour into a porcelain dish to form sticks. When refining silver sand in a crucible, grind the borax into powder, mix with fine rice vinegar, and apply evenly to the sand by hand. After removal from the crucible, scrape the borax from the sand for reuse.\n\n**Subduing Fire Saltpeter Method**\nGrind one *liǎng* of saltpeter and half a *liǎng* of arsenic together to fine powder. Line and cover the crucible with white tiger powder, seal the arsenic tightly, and externally reinforce it. Refine with three to five *jīn* of charcoal fire until red-hot. Then add half a *liǎng* of *shū*, increasing to four *liǎng*, to form a crucible for nurturing one *liǎng* of mother sand. Using sand refined with the two *qì* is especially effective.\n\n**Another Dead Arsenic Method**\nTake one *liǎng* each of arsenic and saltpeter, and two *liǎng* of white alum, grind to fine powder. First melt half the saltpeter and alum, then add the arsenic, and cover with the remaining half of saltpeter and alum until fully calcined. Then add three *liǎng* of *yángqǐshí*, two *liǎng* of *báishízhī*, and three *liǎng* of *hánshuǐshí*, and grind with the previous medicine into powder. Mix with water to form pills the size of soap beans, dry thoroughly, and place in a sand container. Ignite with charcoal fire until five-colored radiance appears—this is the Divine Immortal Defense.\n\n**Subduing Arsenic with the Jade Maiden’s Extraction**\nTake one *liǎng* of gold-footed arsenic, wrap the powder in two or three layers of silk, and bind it with a paste made from fresh ginger juice and white flour. Then take two *jīn* of *dìfūzǐ* powder, mix with vinegar to form lumps, and encase the medicine. Ignite with five *jīn* of charcoal fire from the *yín* hour to the *shēn* hour.\n\n**Gold Crucible Arsenic Subduing Method**\nTake one *liǎng* of *shū*, place in a porcelain jar, and melt three *liǎng* of tin over fire. Add arsenic in pieces the size of soap beans gradually until it floats to the surface. Remove and let cool, then take the arsenic and grind with an equal part of cinnabar. Place in a crucible, set in a wind furnace, and refine until it perishes—this can then be used.\n\n**Subduing Saltpeter Method**\nTake three *liǎng* of fine cinnabar, two *liǎng* of mulberry root bark, and one *liǎng* of *kǔshēn*, grind to fine powder. Place one *jīn* of saltpeter in a crucible, line and cover with the powdered medicine, add saltpeter in the center, and without sealing, fire until red-hot. The resulting golden liquid resembles jade and can be shaped into vessels.\n\nFor use, place any amount of saltpeter in a crucible and seal the mouth with bitter bamboo leaves.\n\n*Various Schools’ Divine Elixir Methods, Scroll Six—End*",

      "translated_text": "**Collected Divine-Grade Alchemical Methods**\n\n**Title:** *Collected Divine-Grade Alchemical Methods*. The compiler is unknown, but it likely dates to the Song dynasty. It compiles alchemical formulas and secrets from various masters, including the *Baopuzi*, Meng Yaofu, Sun the Perfected, and Lü Dongbin. Six fascicles. Base text from: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongshen* section, *Zhongshu* category.\n\n---\n\n**Collected Divine-Grade Alchemical Methods, Fascicle One**\n\n**Inner Chapters of the *Baopuzi***\n\nThe *Baopuzi* states: The methods of divine transcendence and the Yellow and White arts comprise twenty-five fascicles, containing over a thousand entries. The \"Yellow\" refers to gold, and the \"White\" to silver. The ancients guarded these methods in secrecy, unwilling to name them directly, and thus concealed them. Some texts title them *Gengxin*—*Gengxin* also signifies metal. Yet most of these methods are profound and abstruse, with only a fraction comprehensible.\n\nThe world often doubts such matters as fantastical, no different from those who disbelieve in divine transcendence. In the past, I followed Master Zheng and Master Zuo in testing these methods in the mountains of Lu, and all succeeded. However, the rigor of their purification rites and taboos was no less arduous than that of compounding the Nine Elixirs of immortality.\n\nVulgar folk often mock me for pursuing heterodoxies, striving to master what the world deems unmasterable. Yet why would I do so? If my aim were merely to display literary skill for posterity, my *Outer Chapters* and miscellaneous writings—over two hundred fascicles—would suffice to convey my intent to later generations. No need for these methods. Moreover, the *Inner Chapters* are written in plain speech, without embellishment.\n\nThe world deems me impractical, neglecting urgent worldly concerns in favor of obscure principles that fail to win popular approval. Yet I cannot abandon these pursuits, for I have witnessed their efficacy. I follow my masters’ teachings not idly, but I am poor, lacking resources, and beset by misfortune. Roads are blocked, ingredients scarce, and I have had no leisure to practice. Now, when I tell others I know how to make gold and silver, yet suffer hunger and cold myself, how is this different from one who cannot walk yet sells remedies for fractures? Who would believe me?\n\nYet not all things go as one wishes; one cannot dismiss them outright. Thus, I diligently record these methods in writing, hoping that those who cherish the strange and prize truth may read my words and grasp their intent.\n\nMan’s power of transformation knows no bounds. The body’s visible form may be concealed, while ghosts and spirits, though hidden, may be revealed—those who master such arts are many. Fire and water exist in the heavens, yet we obtain them through the *yang* mirror and the *fangzhu*. Lead is inherently white, yet it may be reddened into cinnabar. Cinnabar is inherently red, yet it may be whitened into lead. Clouds, rain, frost, and snow are all qi of Heaven and Earth, yet with the right ingredients, they may be wrought into the genuine—no different from the transformations of birds and beasts, insects and worms, which, though shaped by creation, possess fixed forms. Yet in an instant, they may shed their old bodies and become something else, their myriad changes too numerous to recount.\n\nMan is the most numinous of beings, yet men and women may alter their forms—into swans, into stones, into tigers, into owls, into serpents, into lightning, or into mandarin ducks. Even great things transform: mountains become abysses, empty valleys rise into hills. Such changes are the natural workings of Heaven and Earth. Why, then, should it be impossible to transmute other things into gold and silver?\n\nConsider the fire obtained from the *yang* mirror or the water drawn from the *fangzhu*—are they different from ordinary fire and water? When a serpent becomes a dragon, or when thatch is refined into grease, are these not the same as their naturally occurring counterparts? Trace their origins, and all arise from the spontaneous resonance of the Dao. Those who do not exhaust principle and fulfill their nature cannot grasp their ultimate meaning. Those who do not trace things back to their beginnings and return to their ends cannot perceive their true forms.\n\nThose with narrow vision and shallow knowledge, unable to seek what lies beyond, dismiss these arts as fantastical because Confucius did not speak of them and the ancient texts do not record them. How crude! It is also said: When Liu Xiang failed to make gold, he declared the world held no such method. This is like a farmer, upon suffering drought or flood, concluding that the Five Grains cannot be sown.\n\nWu Taiwen, the Prefect of Chengdu, was learned and widely informed. He recounted studying under the Daoist Li Gen, who smelted lead and tin, adding a small amount of medicine—no larger than a soybean—and stirring with an iron rod. Upon cooling, it became silver. Taiwen obtained the secret method but, constantly occupied with official duties, never practiced it, and often sighed in regret.\n\nHuan Junshan spoke of Cheng Wei, a Gentleman of the Yellow Gate who was fond of the Yellow and White arts. He married a woman who knew the method. Once, when Wei was to accompany the imperial procession but lacked proper attire, he grew anxious. His wife said, \"Let me procure two bolts of silk.\" Though the silk was old, it soon appeared before them. Wei followed the *Hongbao* in his *Pillow Book* to make gold but failed. His wife went to inspect and found him fanning the coals, with mercury in the fire. She said, \"Let me show you something,\" and took a small amount of medicine from her pouch, casting it in. After the time it takes to eat a meal, she raked it out—it had turned to silver.\n\nWei was astonished and said, \"The Dao lies with you! Why did you not tell me sooner?\" She replied, \"One must be destined to receive it.\" Wei then entreated her day and night, selling fields and houses to provide for her, yet she still refused to teach him. He resorted to beating and torturing her. She said, \"The Dao must be transmitted to the right person. Even if we met by chance on the road, I would impart it thus. But if one’s mouth says yes while their heart says no, even if you cut me to pieces, the Dao would not pass my lips.\" Wei pressed her relentlessly. She then went mad, stripped naked, and ran off, smearing herself with mud until she died.\n\nMore recently, Hua Ling, the Prefect of Lujiang—a man of lofty talent and broad learning—was skeptical of extraordinary matters.",

      "translated_text": "Later, a Daoist spoke to him of the art of *huangbai* (transmuting base metals into silver and gold). Hua Ling tested him by having him perform it: iron vessels were used to melt lead, and when powdered elixir was cast into the molten metal, it turned to silver. This silver was then melted again, and another elixir was added, transmuting it into gold.\n\nHua Ling also studied the art of *cheshi* (penetrating vision) from this Daoist. Before a hundred days had passed, he could see clearly at night as if it were day—celestial patterns, the outlines of houses and fences, even the details of his neighbors’ homes, all became vividly apparent. His late wife, named Yaohua, appeared before him in visible form and spoke of their past life together. When he worshipped at a temple, the spirits responded to his obeisance.\n\nHua Ling sighed in wonder, saying: \"Such things are not recorded in the world, nor are they found in the Five Classics—yet they cannot be dismissed as mere imagination. Even those unfamiliar with esoteric arts would be astonished upon hearing of them. Moreover, the practice of *huangbai* is like the concoction of divine elixirs: both require a hundred days or more of purification and fasting. Some methods demand oral instructions, all of which must be transmitted by a master. One should also enter the depths of secluded mountains, to a place of purity, where the uninitiated cannot witness the process. In the past, Liu Xiang attempted it within the palace, having palace women attend to him. Yet they were not purified, nor could he sever worldly ties or prevent others from coming and going—how could he have succeeded? Even dyeing silk or bleaching cloth requires keeping it from the sight of outsiders, lest the process be ruined. How much more so for the transformations of *huangbai*?\n\nIn all matters, great or small, one must grasp the essentials. If one cannot even brew fine wine or prepare a proper meal, how can one hope to accomplish greater things? As Master Zheng once said: When a perfected person creates gold, they consume it themselves to attain immortality—not to amass wealth. Thus, the scriptures say: *Gold can be made, but the world cannot be transcended.* Silver may also be consumed, though it is not as potent as gold.\n\nI once questioned this, asking: If gold and silver already exist in the world, why transmute them? And if they are transmuted, they are not genuine—would that not be deception? Master Zheng replied: Worldly gold and silver *can* be consumed, but Daoists are often poor. As the saying goes: *There are no fat immortals, only wealthy Daoists.* With five or ten disciples, how could one afford to provide them with gold and silver? Moreover, they lack the means to obtain it, so transmutation is necessary. Furthermore, the gold produced through alchemy is the essence of various medicines—superior even to natural gold. The *Scriptures of Divine Immortals* state: *Cinnabar essence generates gold.* This refers to creating gold from elixirs. Thus, in the mountains, where cinnabar is found above, gold often lies below.\n\nOnce transmuted, the gold is a true substance—refined a hundred times, it does not diminish. This follows the natural Dao of heaven and earth, so how can it be called deception? Deception is like coating iron with malachite to turn it red, or using egg white to alter copper into something resembling gold—these change only the surface, not the essence. Lingzhi mushrooms grow naturally, yet the immortals’ scriptures describe cultivating them from five stones and five woods, harvesting and consuming them to attain longevity. These are no different from wild lingzhi, just as transmuted gold is no different from natural gold. The pheasant transforms into a clam, the sparrow into a mussel—these are no different from their naturally occurring counterparts. Thus, the scriptures say: *The flowing pearl, after nine refinements, a father does not teach his son. Transmuting into yellow and white, nature itself assists.* And again: *Cinnabar made into gold, consumed to ascend as an immortal—this is the path of the superior adept. Eating lingzhi and practicing breath control to attain long life—this is the way of the middling adept. Consuming herbs and grasses to live a thousand years—this is the practice of the inferior adept.*\n\nThe *Jade Tablet Record* states: *All under heaven may live forever—only hesitation prevents success.* The *Bronze Pillar Scripture* says: *Cinnabar can be made into gold; the river chariot can produce silver in an instant. Once achieved, it is genuine. Master its Dao, and you may attain an immortal’s body.* Huangshanzi said: *Heaven and earth contain gold—I can make it. Two yellows and one red, formed without doubt.* The *Tortoise Shell Scripture* declares: *My life is in my hands, not heaven’s. The returning elixir becomes gold, enduring for ten thousand years.* How could the ancients have deceived us?\n\nThe problem is that those who know this Dao are often poor, and the medicines grow in distant lands, unobtainable in times of chaos. Saltpeter, brine, and other minerals were once so cheap in peaceful times as to be nearly worthless—now, they are priceless, and even then, one cannot find them. Qiangli realgar is sought by the thousand, yet a single catty is hard to come by. Many know the methods, yet without the means, they are no better off than the ignorant. What a lamentable state!\n\nThose who possess the method may still suffer hunger and cold, unable to gather the ingredients.",

      "translated_text": "Yet those who are wealthy and noble, in turn, do not know the method. Even if they were to know it, scarcely one in ten thousand would believe. And even if they did believe, they already possess abundant gold and silver—why would they spend their visible wealth to purchase the medicines? Fearing the regret of chasing mirages and pursuing the ephemeral, none are willing to attempt it.\n\nMoreover, without the oral instructions of an enlightened master, one must not act rashly. The formulas and medicines of physicians are quite openly revealed, yet when their masters employ them to achieve results, they again conceal them. Thus, formulas are sealed with glue from the secluded women of the rear palace. Cinnabar of the Mud-Pill, Wooden Ghost Seeds, Golden Millet Mushrooms, Flying Soldier Roots, Crouching Dragon Liver, White Horse Sweat, Floating Cloud Marsh, Dragon’s Robe, Night-Shining Bones, Hundred-Flower Nectar, Winter Tsou Qi, and the like—these are all common substances. Yet without the oral instructions, they remain unknowable. How much more so for the alchemy of the Yellow and White? It is not merely their cost that is concealed.\n\nThis Dao, once perfected, grants longevity—thus the ancients valued it highly. The names of medicinal substances in formula books may coincide with common drugs yet differ in reality. For example, the \"Old Woman of the Riverbank\" is not a woman; \"Master Ziming of Lingyang\" is not a man; \"Yu’s Remnant Root\" is not rice; \"Yao’s Brew\" is not water. Yet when ordinary people see formulas calling for dragon’s gall, tiger’s paw, chicken’s head, duck’s foot, horse’s lung, dog’s blood, rat’s tail, or ox’s knee, they assume them to be dark-blooded things. When they see broken cups, overturned basins, cauldron clappers, spurge, ghost arrows, or celestial hooks, they take them for iron and pottery vessels. When they see \"Hu King’s Envoy,\" \"Leaning Withered Woman,\" \"Wild Husband,\" \"Field Guardian,\" \"Dai Wenluo,\" or \"Xu Changqing,\" they assume them to be human names—so close at hand! Without knowing the arcane formulas, who could fully comprehend them?\n\nLiu Xiang failed to transmute gold—was this truly surprising? Had he grasped the essentials, he would not have required the talents of sages and worthies to succeed; any ordinary person could have done so. Was Liu Xiang a dullard? He simply lacked the oral instructions.\n\nNow, I shall record the concise and effective methods to bequeath to like-minded seekers of the future.\n\nFirst, obtain Wu Du realgar, its color like a rooster’s comb and lustrous, free of impurities. The quantity is at your discretion, but do not use less than five catties. Pound it to powder, mix it with ox gall, and boil it into granules. Prepare a red-clay cauldron with a one-dou capacity. First, line the cauldron with a three-fen layer of Qiang salt and chalcanthite powder. Then add a five-fen layer of realgar powder, followed by another layer of Qiang salt. Repeat this sequence until all is used. Add crushed charcoal the size of jujube pits to a depth of two cun. Seal the cauldron’s exterior with a mixture of earthworm soil and Qiang brine, then cover it with another cauldron, sealing both with a two-cun layer of the same mixture to prevent qi leakage. Dry in the shade for a month, then warm with horse-dung fire for three days and nights. When cool, open it to find the bronze below, flowing like cold copper or iron. Cast this bronze into a crucible, fill it with cinnabar water, and warm it with horse-dung fire for forty days. Open it, and refine the bronze to obtain *geng*. Use the *geng* to make another crucible, fill it again with cinnabar water, and warm it with horse-dung fire for thirty days. Open it, refine the contents, and grind them. Take two parts raw cinnabar and one part cinnabar powder (mercury is quicksilver), and it will immediately become yellow gold—lustrous and beautiful, fit for consumption.\n\n**Method for Making Cinnabar Water**\nTreat one catty of cinnabar, place it in a bamboo crucible, and add two liang each of chalcanthite and saltpeter, layering them above and below. Seal the crucible’s mouth with lacquer-bone pellets and let it dry. Fill a jar with several sheng of strong bitter wine, place the crucible inside, and bury it three chi deep in the earth. After thirty days, it will become a watery liquid, red in color and bitter in taste.\n\n**Master Jin Lou’s Method for Transmuting Gold (Learned from Master Qing Lin)**\nFirst, refine tin into squares six cun wide and one cun and one fen thick. Mix red salt with limewater to a mud-like consistency, coat the tin with a one-fen layer, and stack it in a red-clay cauldron. For every ten catties of tin, use four catties of red brine. Seal the cauldron’s seams, warm it with horse-dung fire for thirty days, then open it. The tin will appear entirely ashen, with bean-sized granules within—this is *geng*. Combine and refine it in a jar with charcoal fire to complete the process. For every ten catties of tin, you will obtain twenty liang of *geng*. Only the red-clay cauldrons of Changsha, Guiyang, Yuzhang, and Nanhai are suitable; the locals use them for cooking, so they are readily available.\n\n**Method for Making Red Brine**\nUse one catty each of cold salt and feather mud, combine them in an iron vessel, and heat with charcoal fire until melted.

Prepare a small iron crucible, six *cun* in diameter, and polish it smooth. Take one *jin* each of red halloysite, saltpeter, mica, hematite, and calcite; half a *jin* of sulfur; four *liang* of malachite; and one *jin* of stalactite. Grind them all finely, sift, and mix with fermented liquid to coat the small crucible to a thickness of two *fen*. Take one *jin* of mercury, half a *jin* of cinnabar, and half a *jin* of *liangfei*, stir until thoroughly blended, and no mercury is visible. Place this in the small crucible, cover it with mica, and secure the iron lid. Set the large crucible over a furnace, melt lead, and pour it into the large crucible until it submerges the small crucible by half a *cun*. When the lead is fully molten, apply a fierce fire and blow for three days and nights to produce *zifen*. Take ten *jin* of lead, melt it in an iron vessel, then transfer it to a copper vessel after twenty days. For every seven *fangcunbi* of lead *zifen* consumed, yellow *geng* is formed. To make white silver, place lead in an iron vessel, add a *fangcunbi* of *zifen*, heat until blended, and pour into water to obtain silver.\n\n**Method for Making *Liangfei***\nTake ten *jin* of lead, place it in an iron vessel, and heat it over an open fire. Add three *liang* of mercury, and promptly scoop out the early-formed substance with an iron ladle—this is *liangfei*.\n\n**Method for Making *Geng* by Master Wucheng**\nPrepare a crucible nine *cun* long and five *cun* in diameter. Grind three *jin* of realgar and an equal portion of earthworm soil into a paste, coat the crucible to a thickness of three *cun*, leaving a four-*cun* opening. Cover with two *ge* of cinnabar water, dry thoroughly over horse dung fire, place in a paulownia box, seal with a copper lid, and firmly pack with yellow sand. Apply another layer of earthworm soil to prevent any leakage of *qi*. Place in a charcoal fire, ensuring three *cun* of charcoal above, until the crucible’s mouth glows red, then cool it. Open to find the realgar absorbed into the copper crucible; remove it. Repeat the process until all three *jin* of realgar are absorbed. Mix the extracted substance with an equal portion of lead oxide to form a furnace of any desired size. To use, place the furnace in charcoal until red-hot, add mercury, then lead. When the yellow substance rises from the sides to the center, pour onto the ground to form yellow *geng*. Each furnace can produce three thousand five hundred *jin* before its power is exhausted.\n\nThis *geng* is softened by soaking *zhuangjing* seeds and red millet in wine for a hundred days, then rolled into pellets the size of small beans. Take one pellet three times daily; consuming one *jin* expels the three worms, corpse *qi*, and all diseases. The blind regain sight, the deaf hear, the aged become youthful, and one remains unburned by fire. No evil, poison, cold, heat, dampness, or toxin can harm them. Consuming three *jin* allows walking on water and mountains, with all spirits attending and guarding, granting life as long as heaven’s. Boil one pellet with coffin blood and *zhucao* to wipe the eyes, enabling sight of ghosts and subterranean objects, and writing in darkness. Coat one pellet with white sheep’s blood and hang it above the city gate to summon dragons standing in pairs. Coat one pellet with black ox blood and red rooster blood, hang it above the city gate, and the area within one *li* will be free of plague. Apply the medicine to cattle, sheep, and livestock to prevent plague, and tigers and leopards will not attack. Mix one pellet with tiger gall and snake fat, throw it toward the enemy’s army on a day corresponding to the lunar mansion, and they will turn on each other in chaos and flee. Coat one pellet with horse blood and cast it into a well to make the water boil, or into a stream to reverse its flow for a hundred paces. Coat one pellet with white dog’s blood and place it in a shrine to manifest its spirits, who can be commanded. Coat one pellet with rabbit blood and consume it, then place another pellet in a place of six *yin* energies to summon jade maidens who can serve sixty or seventy people. Coat one pellet with carp gall and carry it into water to part the waves ten *zhang* deep, allowing breath and movement underwater, and keeping clothes dry in rain. Boil one pellet with purple amaranth, hold it in the mouth, and swallow its juice to go a hundred days without hunger. Boil one pellet with magnetite and place it in the hair; striking an enemy will deflect blades and arrows, and any arrows shot will turn back. Mix one pellet with soil from the days of the Six *Ding* and Six *Ren* gods to conceal oneself when applied to the philtrum. Hold one pellet, face north, and spit at a great fire to extinguish it. At the hours of *geng*, *xin*, *shen*, or *you*, face northwest and throw one pellet to wither trees on the same day. Throw one pellet while performing the *Yu* step to kill tigers, wolves, snakes, and locusts instantly. Dissolve one pellet to write on stone, and the writing will penetrate its surface; on metal, it will sink into its texture, and no amount of scraping will remove it. For sudden death within a day, place one pellet in water corresponding to the lunar mansion and insert it into the throat, then have someone hold water in their mouth and spray it onto the deceased’s face to revive them. Coat one pellet with fox blood and crane blood, place it under the fingernail, and point at anything to transform it at will—mountains will move, trees will walk, and all will witness it, though the changes are real.

      "translated_text": "Moreover, when Laozi expounded the *Five Thousand Characters*, and the Buddha unfolded the teachings of the Three Vehicles, they spoke only of the fundamental principle of perceiving one’s nature. Yet birth is followed by death, and though one may preserve that nature, cultivating an empty and luminous spirit, the body remains impermanent. How can this compare to the *Returned Elixir*, which grants immortality in life, an undying and unceasing existence, transforming the inner essence to achieve transcendence as a flying immortal? This is the true method of deliberate cultivation.\n\nThroughout the ages, countless Daoist immortals have attained the Way, yet none have spoken of the *Returned Elixir*. For this path is vast and profound, not to be lightly disclosed. Instead, they taught methods such as absorbing the light of the sun and moon to refine essence and circulate *qi*, contemplating the spirit and guarding the One, or the arts of sexual yoga to preserve essence. They also prescribed herbal medicines, minerals, metals, and the five metals and eight stones—practices that may briefly prolong life, setting one slightly apart from the common folk, but ultimately failing to open the path to eternal life. Should one encounter water or fire, blades or warfare, venomous creatures or fierce beasts, poison or misfortune, or harm from ghosts and spirits, the life force cannot escape the workings of the Five Phases. A thousand such dangers render these methods unreliable in the end.\n\nHave you not seen how the ancients ascended with their entire households? This was the power of the *Great Returned Elixir*—the most precious, revered, noble, wondrous, and mysterious of treasures. The term *returned* signifies a reversal, a homecoming; *elixir* denotes the color vermilion. It is the process of transmuting cinnabar to extract true mercury, then refining mercury with lead to produce the *Yellow Sprout*, which in turn reverts to cinnabar. When cinnabar is subdued by fire, it transforms into the *Returned Elixir*. This reversal bestows miraculous effects: the aged regain youth, the dead are revived, the withered flourish, and worthless stones are transmuted into supreme treasures. Is not its divine power vast indeed?\n\nThe *Great Returned Elixir* has three grades:\n- The **Upper Grade**: the *Ninefold Transmutation Golden Liquid Jade Essence Great Returned Elixir*, a celestial treasure not transmitted to the mortal world.\n- The **Middle Grade**: the *Dragon and Tiger Great Elixir*.\n- The **Lower Grade**: the *Eight-Stone Transmutation Mercury Ninefold Divine Elixir*.\n\nSince the Yellow Emperor refined the elixir and ascended, the *Dragon and Tiger Great Elixir* has been the most potent. With but a single *daogui* ingested, one secures longevity, dispels evil, and returns to the true. The Three Worms and Nine Parasites are eradicated, the *dantian* is fortified, and the spirit remains undispersed. The countless immortals of high antiquity all concealed the principles of the *Returned Elixir*. Though later texts on the elixir exist, they obscure the profound mysteries and lack the oral transmission. Those in later generations who sought the Way found no foothold, wasting their years in vain until old age.\n\nNow, I reveal this celestial secret, setting down the oral transmission in full for those of sincere aspiration. Those who would cultivate the Way of *xing* and *ming* need no longer hesitate or err.\n\n**Oral Transmission on the True Dragon and True Tiger**\nThe *True Dragon* is the mercury within cinnabar. It is born when the true *qi* of the sun’s radiance descends into the earth—this is called *mercury*. The *True Tiger* is the silver within black lead. It is born when the true *qi* of the moon’s essence descends into the earth—this is called *lead*. These two treasures are endowed with the true *qi* of the sun’s essence and the moon’s radiance: lead possesses *qi*, while mercury is formless. Among the seventy-two stones, none surpass lead and mercury in nobility—they alone can produce the *Dragon and Tiger Great Returned Elixir*.\n\nAs the scripture states: \"Living mercury can preserve the dead, while dead mercury can preserve the living.\" The proof is before your eyes, yet those who walk as mere corpses fail to pursue the Great Elixir. Such divine efficacy is bestowed only upon those with an immortal’s destiny, a legacy of ancestral blessing. Whoever encounters this method must guard it in utmost secrecy. Do not reveal it lightly, for to do so invites calamity upon oneself. Even to one’s closest kin, such as father and son, it must not be spoken. Only to a perfected being of shared heart and Dao may the oral transmission be entrusted.\n\n**End of Scroll One of *Divine-Grade Elixir Methods of Various Schools***\n**Beginning of Scroll Two of *Divine-Grade Elixir Methods of Various Schools***",

The location should be near sweet-spring waters, and the year, month, day, and hour must be auspicious. Then, construct a chamber, seal the furnace, and position the crucible. The crucible should be made of earth from the wù and jǐ directions, fired with amber—this is the proper method.\n\nFor the central embryo’s union with the Child, amber is likewise used. The crucible must be neither too wide nor too narrow, its dimensions assessed in the moment to accommodate the central embryo’s union with the Child. It should allow for the free circulation of fire-qi in its revolutions—this is most sublime. If the crucible is too wide, Water and Fire will fail to harmonize; if too narrow, the qi of Water and Fire will not flow. Careful attention to detail is essential.\n\nThe furnace comprises six altars in three tiers, corresponding to the Three Powers. The crucible is placed atop the furnace, where Water and Fire achieve harmony. The furnace should be constructed to a height of one foot and two inches, with a width of one foot and six inches. The central chamber should measure one foot in diameter, with an outer thickness of three inches. At the front, a fire-door is opened, five inches in height and four inches in width, to admit the flame. At the rear, a solid passage shaped like a chimney is left to vent the fire-qi.

      "translated_text": "Once the furnace is installed and the crucible positioned, kindle the fire with offerings placed beside them. Reverently announce to the celestial and terrestrial deities: arrange three portions of wine and fruit to the north, with three incense altars. First, scatter incense and bow; then kneel deeply and whisper in secret:\n\n*\"On this day, month, and year, I, [name] of [place], undertake the firing of the elixir, seeking immortality. My vow is complete.\"*\n\nAgain address the deities, praying:\n\n*\"May the Great Dao and all Perfected Immortals witness my sincerity and swiftly perfect the golden and silver elixirs. Consuming them, may I attain longevity, ascend to the Nine Heavens, and share the lifespan of sun and moon.\"*\n\nThis disciple’s prayer is written in blue.\n\nThe rite concluded, consume the offerings yourself.\n\nBefore the separation of primal chaos, the Dao dwelt in profound obscurity. Once divided, a single qi arose—this is the True One. From the One came Two, from Two came Three, and from Three, the myriad things. Among all things, humans are the most spiritually endowed, thus forming the Three Powers with Heaven and Earth. Yet within the Three Powers, only human lifespans are finite: the long-lived may not reach a century, while the short-lived perish before their time. Reflecting in stillness, I could not but sigh in sorrow.\n\nIn my youth, I chanced upon alchemical classics and glimpsed their essence. The method of refining the Returned Elixir possesses wondrous efficacy—those who consume it attain longevity, their lives equaling Heaven and Earth. Thus, I pored over the texts again and again, pondering their meaning with delight. From that time onward, my heart yearned for immortality, dwelling upon it day and night, even in dreams. For over twenty years, I was fortunate to meet a Perfected One who transmitted the secrets of the medicines. Only then did I understand that lead and mercury are, in truth, one metal and one water, while the firing times employ one yin and one yang.\n\nYet I lament the swift passage of time, the days and months slipping by in procrastination. Failing to find a like-minded companion, I struggled alone in cultivation. Now, I record the true instructions I have received, alongside excerpts from the alchemical classics of the ancient sages, elucidating their meanings. This compilation is titled *The Secret Essentials of the Golden Elixir, Aligned with the Three Powers*. I present the matter directly, without embellishment. Though some verses may repeat or the language seem coarse, my aim is to convey the principle, not refine the prose.\n\nThe Way of the Returned Elixir is profoundly mysterious and abstruse. Thus, despite my humble and unpolished nature, I set these words in order. Should there be those of shared aspiration, I pray they may peruse them with favor.\n\nI have heard that the tradition of the Returned Elixir traces back to the Three Sovereigns. The Three Sovereigns bequeathed their model, and the Five Emperors succeeded one another, passing down the teachings through the ages, transmitted from the benevolent to the worthy. In the era of the Three Sovereigns, the arts of immortality were taught first, and the throne was abdicated afterward. After the Five Emperors, the Way declined and scattered among recluses in the mountains and forests. Thus, many immortals have emerged across the dynasties, each leaving behind teachings and alchemical classics, thousands of scrolls circulating in the world. All are profoundly subtle, yet few grasp their ultimate import. Though the Way of the Returned Elixir is known to exist, those who comprehend it are rare.\n\nThis method embodies the vast emptiness of the Great Dao, resonating with the Three Powers and the workings of Heaven and Earth. It seizes the creative power of the cosmos and steals the generative functions of the four seasons. Therefore, those who refine the elixir must first master celestial patterns, then understand terrestrial principles, penetrate the mysteries of yin and yang, and fathom the permutations of the hexagrams. They must also regulate the cyclical days of the waxing and waning phases, the ascent and descent of the firing times, and the methods of advancing and retreating the crucible and furnace. Only then can they enter the gate of the Dragon and Tiger’s symbolic resonance, recognize the subtleties of true lead and mercury, and—combining inner clarity of virtue with outer acts of compassion—unite their heart with the elixir and attain true yang.\n\nThe art of the Returned Elixir is achieved through karmic affinity; it cannot be grasped in a single morning or evening, nor by merely clutching scrolls and parsing texts. One must personally encounter a Perfected One and receive their secret oral transmission—without this, the profound essence of the Returned Elixir remains unknowable.\n\nSome recklessly interpret the classics, mistaking common lead for true lead or ordinary mercury for true mercury. They speculate on yin and yang, guess at firing times, and blindly cultivate without guidance, entrusting their fate to heaven. In refining lead and mercury, the firing times come first, followed by the yin-yang furnace and crucible.\n\nTo illustrate the Returned Elixir: in the eleventh month, when the first yang stirs, apply fire for five days per phase. The fire begins with the hexagram *Fu* (Return) and concludes with *Kun* (Receptive), naturally harmonizing yin and yang without error in the qi phases. Lead and mercury follow their own principles, relying on the firing times, which are governed by the *Book of Changes*. If the firing deviates from the qi phases, even with true lead and mercury, the elixir will not form. How can untimely actions yield timely results? Like the sun and moon shining constantly, the blind cannot see—not due to any fault of the luminaries, but because the cultivator acts in haste.\n\nWhen using lead and mercury for the elixir, many err by taking black lead as true lead or mistaking cinnabar-derived mercury for true mercury. Some extract lead yellow as the \"yellow sprout,\" or refine saltpeter, distill mercury, or use cinnabar, lead ashes, litharge, the two greens, three yellows, five metals, and eight minerals. All such substances, being material, are not the ultimate method. As the Perfected Lord Yin said: *\"Material things cannot serve as companions; forced refinement harms the practitioner.\"* Those who study the elixir must be cautious.\n\nThe two substances, lead and mercury, are thoroughly concealed in the alchemical classics. Without direct explanation, their nature remains obscure. Lead is silver—true lead is the sacred silver derived from lead, born of the moon’s essence and the water essence of Great Yin. If one can refine and subdue it into an elixir, how could it not grant longevity? True lead is definitively silver, without doubt or error. As Master Azure Radiance said:\n\n*\"The yellow sprout is not lead—\nSeek it within lead.\nTo recognize the yellow sprout,\nLook to what lies within lead.\"*\n\nMercury is quicksilver, obtained from cinnabar. Though it has form, it lacks substance. It absorbs silver’s blackness and solidifies, hence it is called true mercury.",

      "translated_text": "It is born of the sun’s essence and assumes blackness—this is the true fire of Great Yang. If one can refine and subdue it into an elixir, how could it not secure one’s destiny? True mercury must be quicksilver, without alternative.\n\n*The Dragon-Tiger Essential Instructions* states:\n*\"Living quicksilver can preserve the dead,\nDead quicksilver can preserve the living.\"*\n\nLead and mercury are the most sagely of heaven and earth, the numinous qi of sun and moon. In symbolic correspondence, they are called Dragon and Tiger. Among all the myriad things, only lead and mercury can produce the Reverted Elixir; all else is not the proper method.\n\nLead possesses qi but lacks inherent form. Mercury, by contrast, has no original shape. Lead is yang within and yin without, thus serving as the ground for the elixir. Borrowing its qi, the Yellow Sprout arises—clearly, when one attains its true qi, the numinous sprout naturally emerges, and thus true lead may be set aside.\n\nMaster Azure Radiance said:\n*\"Lead is the mother of the sprout,\nThe sprout is the child of lead.\nOnce the Golden Flower is attained,\nLead is set aside and not employed.\"*\n\nMercury, originally formless, resembles qi in its state. Its nature is wholly yang, yet its form is wholly yin. Placing a hundred *hu* of it into a cauldron and refining it to dryness reveals its original substance. When sown into lead, it absorbs lead’s essential qi and transforms its quality—this is called the Yellow Sprout. Is this not the emergence of substance from the formless?\n\nLord Yin the True said:\n*\"From formless substance, substance is born—this is the Reverted Elixir.\"*\n\nThe Yellow Sprout is the foundation of the Great Elixir. *The Record of the Supreme Change* states:\n*\"Without the Yellow Sprout’s wonder,\nThe Reverted Elixir’s path remains distant.\"*\n\nIn preparing the Yellow Sprout, one must seize the height of its vigor, with the White Dew as the starting point. At this time, the metal’s color is perfectly luminous, the toad’s light full and abundant—this is the season for refining the elixir.\n\nMaster Xu the True said:\n*\"In the eighth month, refine the head;\nIn winter, nurture the child.\"*\n\nBeginning in the first days of the eighth month, one employs the Nine Cauldrons to obtain the Yellow Sprout. By the tenth month, all depends on the balance of water and fire, the harmony of yin and yang, so that the numinous sprout naturally emerges. If water and fire are not balanced, the lead’s base will be overrun, and the numinous sprout will be infiltrated, rendering it unusable—like the eye, which cannot tolerate even the slightest mote.\n\nEight ounces of Yellow Sprout form the upper crescent; eight ounces of mercury form the lower crescent. Together, the two crescents unite to make one *jin*. Each *jin* is sixteen ounces, each ounce twenty-four *zhu*, so one *jin* totals three hundred eighty-four *zhu*, corresponding to the number of hexagrams.\n\nFor the upper crescent of eight ounces, one must regulate the fire-phase to steal sufficient lead-blackness before it is fit for use.\n\nMaster Li the True said:\n*\"The lower crescent must rely on the upper’s fulfillment.\"*\nFor the Yellow Sprout is the foundation of the elixir. If it does not receive enough blackness, the elixir will not be subdued.\n\nMaster Azure Radiance said:\n*\"The medicine in the crucible\nIs like a hen brooding her eggs,\nLike a child in the womb,\nLike fruit on the tree.\nOnly when it has received enough blackness\nWill it naturally ripen.\"*\n\nOnce the medicine enters the central womb, it must be sealed tightly to prevent the leakage of true blackness. It is also said:\n*\"Seal the womb without leakage—\nTransformation occurs in an instant.\"*\n\nThe form of the central womb is round, like heaven and earth before their separation, blended as an egg’s roundness, rising and falling like Penglai. Its openings are minutely sealed, with spirit circulating within. When the medicine enters the central womb and one prepares to refine it, one must first select the ground.\n\nChoose only a site of blessed virtue, where the year and month are auspicious, a place of purity, seclusion, and tranquility. Ancient temples, tombs, abandoned wells, ruined kilns, battlefields, or sites defiled by women’s childbirth—none of these are suitable for refinement.\n\nLord Yin the True said:\n*\"Without the proper ground, do not act rashly.\nOne must obtain the ground and then seek the Elixir Well.\"*\n\nThe well is the most urgent necessity for refining the elixir. Day and night, water and fire are drawn and replenished, and the well’s dripping is essential. Since ancient times, immortals who ascended to transcendence all left their elixir wells behind, demonstrating the well’s critical role in elixir refinement.\n\nOnce the elixir well is established, do not allow it to be defiled. After the water’s pulse stabilizes, it must be dredged and replaced to clear stagnant springs. Then, expose it to the open sky so that the stars and moon may shine upon it. Once the water’s nature is settled and the earth’s blackness is gathered, it may be drawn for elixir refinement.\n\nIf the water is clear and white with a sweet taste, issuing from a stony base, it is yang-pulse water—most efficacious for elixir refinement. If it flows through black mud or yellow earth, or if the spring is red and iron-tinged with a bitter, astringent taste, such signs indicate mixed water pulses, yin and yang stagnation, and it is unfit for elixir refinement. One must construct another.\n\nMaster Le the True said:\n*\"First select an auspicious site,\nThen establish the well and altar.\nAvoid all defilement,\nAnd shun foul odors.\"*\n\nHaving obtained the elixir ground and elixir well, one must next prepare the crucible and vessel. For the Reverted Elixir cannot be completed without them.\n\n*The Scripture of Primordial Chaos* states:\n*\"Kan and Li are the medicine;\nQian and Kun are the crucible.\nWhen the four embrace one another,\nIt is called the Sacred Key.\"*\n\nQian is metal; Kun is earth. Earth gives birth to metal, hence it is called the Metal Crucible—not that metal is used as the crucible. The crucible is the chamber of the elixir. When the crucible is complete, the myriad things are born within it. The crucible corresponds to the Central Palace, and the Central Palace belongs to earth, which gives birth to the myriad things—thus the crucible is made of earth.\n\nLord Yin the True said:\n*\"One must seek the crucible in the Central Palace.\"*\nClearly, this means using common earth to fire porcelain for the crucible.\n\nAs for the porcelain used in the central womb, its length and width are determined at the time of fabrication. The ancients did not record measurements, and later accounts vary—how could one rigidly adhere to them? If it is too wide, the qi of water and fire will not converge; if too narrow, the qi of water and fire will not circulate. One must consider this carefully.\n\nHaving obtained the crucible, one must then construct the furnace, for the furnace is the enclosure of the crucible. Without the furnace, the crucible is like a person without a dwelling—how can one reside without city walls? Thus, the furnace is placed at a distance from the crucible to contain the fire’s qi.\n\nThe furnace’s base has a platform, three tiers high, octagonal in shape, with eight gates. Above the gates are partitions, and upon these the crucible is placed. Water rests above the crucible, and the medicine below.",

      "translated_text": "The water crucible has an open mouth to receive the water, covered with a lid. Its height is two chi and one cun, its width one chi and six cun, with a central opening one chi and three cun wide and three cun thick. At the front is a fire gate, five cun high and four cun wide. At the rear is an aperture to vent the fire’s qi, resembling the chimney of a stove. Yet the ancient sages each left different models—those who refine the elixir must examine them carefully.\n\nOnce the yellow sprout has entered the womb, the womb is placed in the crucible, and the crucible in the furnace, layer upon layer, sealed tightly to prevent the true qi from leaking. Before introducing water and fire, one must first regulate the water clock, ensuring it flows from dawn to dusk without pause. The cycles of yin and yang are measured by the clock; if the clock errs, the balance of water and fire will be lost—thus, everything depends on the water clock. I have seen later students of the elixir neglect the water clock, which is deeply mistaken. The efficacy of the returned elixir is profoundly wondrous: when a person consumes it, they become an immortal; when a dog eats it, it turns into a dragon; when a chicken feeds on it, it transforms into a phoenix. This is because it seizes the creative power of Heaven and Earth, yielding such miraculous results. Without the water clock, how can yin and yang be regulated? As Baixuanzi said: *\"Entering the crucible without relying on the clock, without the clock the elixir will not form—like a blind man discarding his staff, or a deaf man strumming a lute.\"*\n\nOnce the water clock is precise and the furnace and crucible are complete, the sprout enters the womb, and one awaits the rise of the first yang line to begin the circulation of water and fire. In refining the elixir, nothing is more difficult than the *huohou* (fire timing). The *huohou* is the great secret of the Orthodox Unity tradition. If a cultivator masters the true *huohou*, how could they fail to produce the returned elixir? If the *huohou* is incomplete, how can the work proceed? The myriad scrolls of elixir scriptures conceal their essence in the *huohou*. The original method takes one year, though the ancient immortals concealed the supreme technique, claiming it required three, nine, or even twelve years—leaving later students at a loss. The claim that one year yields a minor return, two years a middle return, and three years a great return is merely a decorative explanation of the elixir’s stages, altering the principle; in truth, three years are not required.\n\nFrom *zi* to *hai* is one year; from *mao* to *you*, two years; from *zi* to *shen*, three years—three threes making nine, the yang number. As Qingxiazi said: *\"From *zi* to *shen* is called the Nine Returns\"*—this is the principle. From *you* to *hai* is the retreat of yang into the yin position. Elixirists do not calculate it thus, hence they speak of three years. The \"nine years\" refers to the nine months from *zi* to *shen*, with each month counted as a year—this is also a reduction of the yang number, embodying the meaning of the Nine Returns. Thus, it is called nine years. The \"twelve years\" refers to the complete ascent and descent of yin and yang over a full year, exhausting one cycle—hence twelve years. Using one month as a year makes it clear that one *shi* (two-hour period) is taken as one month. One day has twelve *shi*, one month totals 360 *shi*, corresponding to 360 days, with one month as one year. This is how the ancient sages confused later generations, guarding the supreme method; in truth, the method requires only one year.\n\nAs Qingxiazi said: *\"I have never heard of a woman carrying a child for two or three years before giving birth.\"* The *huohou* of one year consists of twelve months, with five days as one *hou* (period) and forty-five days as one *jie* (node). The ancients used the *Book of Changes* as a model: its sixty-four hexagrams take *Qian* and *Kun* as the crucible, *Kan* and *Li* as the medicine, and four hexagrams as the furnace’s mechanism, while the remaining sixty serve as the numbers for circulating fire. The process begins with *Zhun* and *Meng* and ends with *Weiji*. Each day uses two hexagrams—thirty days in a month, totaling sixty hexagrams, cycling endlessly. *Zhun* at dawn, *Meng* at dusk, ten months to gestate the medicine, two months to nurture it, like a mother nursing her child—only after ten months is it fully mature.\n\nThe fire begins on the first day of the eleventh month, and after sixty days, the black medicine coalesces in the womb. In the first month, the *jiedu* hexagram fire is applied. From *yin* to *shen* is called the Seven Returns; from *zi* to *shen*, the Nine Returns. Fire flourishes at *wu*, is interred at *xu*, and the work concludes at *hai*. The fire begins with the first yang at *fu* in the eleventh month, followed by *lin* in the twelfth month, *tai* in the first month, *dazhuang* in the second, *guai* in the third, *qian* in the fourth, *gou* in the fifth, *dun* in the sixth, *pi* in the seventh, *guan* in the eighth, *bo* in the ninth, and *kun* in the tenth—refining the medicine into the elixir, completing the work in one year. This is the general outline.\n\nFor those who wish to refine the elixir, first prepare all implements, tools, furnace, crucible, water, and fire in the medicine chamber after the middle of the tenth month. On the day before the Great Snow, gently heat the stove, awaiting the arrival of the *zhifu* to report the time. At the first yang line’s birth at the *zi* hour on the Great Snow’s eleventh-month node, introduce water and fire, advancing and retreating with the six lines, each line occupying ten *shi*. Maintain the original starting point, cycling two hexagrams per day—these are the daily hexagrams. Follow the hexagram images in sequence, with fifteen days as one *qi*. Before each *qi*, set aside two and a half days, totaling thirty *shi*. The *mao* and *you* gates of the second and eighth months are called the \"dead *qi*\"—a great taboo for elixirists, during which water and fire are not introduced. Over twelve months, there are twenty-four *qi*, but excluding twenty-four instances of one and a half days (totaling sixty days, exactly two months), only ten months remain for the actual circulation of water and fire. Thus, it is clear that the returned elixir gestates for ten months before emerging, like a human fetus born after ten months in the womb. This principle is profound and mysterious, known only to the divine and sagely—truly wondrous.\n\nBefore each *qi*, for two and a half days at *mao*, temporarily halt the water and fire, and do not open the crucible.",
      "overlap_context": "one must then construct the furnace, for the furnace is the enclosure of the crucible. Without the furnace, the crucible is like a person without a dwelling—how can one reside without city walls? Thus, the furnace is placed at a distance from the crucible to contain the fire’s qi.\n\nThe furnace’s base has a platform, three tiers high, octagonal in shape, with eight gates. Above the gates are partitions, and upon these the crucible is placed. Water rests above the crucible, and the medicine below.",

      "translated_text": "For the latter two and a half days of each *qi* at *you*, first halt the water and fire, then open the crucible. Retrieve the elixir for its \"bathing\"—grind it three thousand times to the left, which is called the \"bathing.\" The opening and closing of the crucible must be utterly secure. The advance and retreat of water and fire must not be too slow or too swift. Rely solely on the water clock, lest the timing be amiss. In operating water and fire, though the clepsydra marks the hours, even if night falls, one must gaze upward to observe where the Dipper’s handle points and where the sun and moon rise and set—this is how to measure the timing, ensuring the union of yin and yang is precise.\n\nIn refining the returned elixir, three practitioners of pure emptiness must join in shared resolve, vowing together that the returned elixir be perfected. Before beginning, they must fast, bathe, and offer prayers to the heavens. One tends the water clock, one adjusts the crucible and alternates water and fire, and one manages the balance of yin and yang, shifting the hexagrams and advancing or retreating water and fire according to the timing. The duties of the three must not err by even a hair’s breadth.\n\nThe Perfected One says: Through the night, all three must guard and pray with utmost reverence. Though each attends to their urgent tasks, they must take turns resting during the night watches. For the work continues day and night without pause, and the passage of time is long—lest the elixirists grow weary and err in their refinement. Within the elixir chamber, incense must burn ceaselessly, offerings made to the Highest Perfected. Apart from two vegetarian meals, all must be strictly observed.\n\nIf water and fire do not err and yin and yang are precisely balanced, the divine embryo within the crucible will transform of itself. From the eleventh month onward, until the fourth month, which belongs to yang, the crucible turns left. From the fifth to the tenth month, which belong to yin, the crucible turns right. When the elixir reaches its utmost flourishing, one must not for a moment abandon the elixir chamber—listen only for the dragon’s roar at the height of its power. Beyond this peak of yang, the elixir has no cause for concern. Gradually reduce the fire, continuing until the tenth month, when pure yang returns to *kun*, and the returned elixir is ripe. Its color shifts to purple-red, its radiance blazing—nine cycles of yang complete, the Five Phases fully realized. From the Son of Heaven to the common folk, even birds and beasts, all who consume it attain longevity. Withered trees regain their bloom, dry bones grow flesh anew. It transmutes tiles and pebbles into gold—its divine power and transformations are unfathomable.\n\nWhenever I read the *Five Thousand Words* of *Laozi* or the *Inner and Outer Radiance of the Yellow Court*, they speak of the principle of primal *qi*, illuminating only the nature while lamenting the existence of form. Form is the dwelling of nature—if there were no form, where would nature reside? I say that the primal gives birth to the existent, and the existent gives birth to form. Since this cause exists, why not secure it? Yet practicing the Way of primal *qi* only revives one after death—how can it compare to the art of the returned elixir, which prevents death in life? For the returned elixir is the true method of deliberate action. If one cultivates it with utmost sincerity, once the elixir is achieved, one attains sagehood and spiritual communion. A single *daogui* ingested fortifies the form forever, one’s name inscribed in the Jade Register, one’s place secured among the immortals—none in the Mysterious Teachings can compare. Though I am but a dust-bound scholar of humble talent, unworthy of this sacred transmission, I dare record these divine secrets. If there are lofty adepts beyond the mundane, those who share this aspiration, I invite them to ponder these words carefully.\n\n**Lü Dongbin’s Method for the Nine-Cycled Golden Elixir of Longevity**\n\nTake eight ounces of the finest yellow *geng* from the West, ground into powder. Then take eight ounces of mercury, and combine the two substances in an iron mortar, pounding for one *shi* (two hours). Naturally, a golden cinnabar sand forms, from which a dark, murky water—impure *qi* from the wood essence—is washed out. This water must be changed repeatedly until the sand is clean. Then take the sand and wrap it tightly in a clean, boiled white silk cloth, roughly the size of a ball, ensuring it is firm. Boil it with alum and vinegar until it becomes a bright, clear blue-green.\n\nGrind one ounce of chalcanthite into powder, mix it with five *sheng* of good vinegar in a pot, and heat until the vinegar boils. Suspend the sand ball within and boil it. If the vinegar evaporates, add more. Boil with warm vinegar for one *fu* (twelve hours) until done. During boiling, the fire must be gentle, allowing only a slight simmer. Once boiled, the sand will naturally harden like iron or stone. The vinegar used to boil the sand and alum is not a harmful substance—it is a wondrous secret for firming the sand.\n\nNext, use *liuyi* clay to seal it. **Method for Making Liuyi Clay**: Take four ounces of the essence of true earth, heat it in charcoal fire until red, then soak it in vinegar until saturated. Also take one ounce each of red halloysite, white halloysite, earthworm soil, cinnabar-coated gold earth, and six other ingredients, along with one *jin* of sweet earth. Combine all seven substances, pound them into powder, and mix with saltwater and a small amount of paper fiber to form a stiff clay. Use this to seal the sand ball tightly, ensuring no cracks or fissures. If any blackened areas appear, patch them with clay to make it utterly firm and complete.\n\nThe sand ball, resembling a sphere, is called the \"elixir embryo\" or the \"divine chamber.\" The essence of true earth is the central *qi* of the center, while the other six ingredients serve as assistants. When the elixir embryo is fired, the lead and mercury within are securely bound, allowing for wondrous transformations through separation.\n\nOnce sealed, take an iron container capable of holding about two *sheng* of material. Fill it with refined lead essence, fully occupying the container. Place the elixir embryo at the center of the lead essence, ensuring it is perfectly centered without tilting. One must be meticulous and single-minded, packing it tightly and filling the container completely. Seal the lid with *liuyi* clay, ensuring no *qi* escapes.",

      "translated_text": "Once the container is sealed, further apply finely sifted clay from fired tiles, mixed with pure paper fiber and scented water, to form a sealing layer about one *cun* thick. Allow it to dry, ensuring no cracks appear; if any are found, repair them until it is utterly firm and complete.\n\nNext, prepare a movable firing furnace and crucible made of iron, resembling an ordinary cooking pot. It should hold approximately one *dou* and eight *sheng*. Alternatively, use a clay crucible, sealing it with mud while leaving one fire-entry port. Fill the crucible with charcoal. Place the sealed elixir container at its center, ensuring it is perfectly centered without tilting, and pack it tightly with charcoal to full capacity. Once the mud is dry, choose the first day of a *liu-jia* cycle. Three days prior, offer incense, lamps, wine, vegetables, gold coins, and paper horses to the furnace deity. At dawn (*mao* hour), take one *jin* of thoroughly ignited charcoal, crush it, and place it evenly at the bottom of the crucible. Cover it lightly with warm ash, leaving one or two parts of fire exposed to gently heat the crucible and nurture the elixir embryo. By dusk (*you* hour), follow the same procedure as at dawn, adding another *jin* of fire. Throughout the twelve hours of day and night, the fire must never be allowed to extinguish. After nurturing it for forty-nine days—exactly seven times seven—the elixir will form into \"mother-and-child gold,\" also called the \"Water-Wood-Fire Elixir Head.\" This is the first transformation of the returning elixir, known as the \"Dragon-Tiger Supreme Treasure.\"\n\nMetal conquers Wood, causing mercury to immediately solidify into cinnabar grains. Wood conquers Earth, ensuring the *liuyi* clay remains firm and does not contaminate the elixir’s body. Earth conquers Water, which is its proper function. Water conquers Fire, preventing mercury from escaping. The five phases restrain one another, giving rise to the numinous essence of Metal and Wood. The five phases generate one another, allowing the returning elixir to solidify. The wise will ponder this—none shall err.\n\nFor the first transformation, once the firing period is complete, allow the crucible to cool, then open it and remove the elixir powder, grinding it into fine dust. Add only eight *liang* of Wood essence (water). Following the first transformation’s procedure, pound it finely, wash and boil it, then prepare *liuyi* clay to seal it. Place it back into the furnace and nurture it with fire for another forty-nine days to complete the cycle, yielding what is called the \"Divine Elixir.\"\n\nBy the fourth transformation, after forty-nine days of nurturing, open the crucible to retrieve the elixir powder, which will have formed into fine cinnabar grains—this is the completion of the Fourfold Divine Elixir. No longer is there need for the lead container or lead essence. Instead, use a small iron container, leaving two parts of its center empty to hold the Fourfold Divine Elixir powder. Take one *jin* of high-grade cinnabar, selecting eight *liang* of the largest pieces. Divide the eight *liang* of Fourfold Divine Elixir powder into the container, spreading it evenly. Arrange the cinnabar like lotus roots, then cover it with another eight *liang* of elixir powder. Layer three *liang* of cinnabar again, followed by another eight *liang* of elixir powder. Repeat this layering: five layers of elixir and four layers of cinnabar, totaling forty *liang* of elixir and twelve *liang* of cinnabar. Once arranged, ensure it is tightly packed. Seal the container’s seams with *liuyi* clay, then apply an additional layer of salt-paper mud one *cun* thick to the exterior. Allow it to dry, then place it in the movable firing crucible, centered in the ash without tilting. Seal the crucible’s seams with salt mud. Once dry, follow the first transformation’s procedure, adding fire for forty-nine days to complete the process. Upon opening the crucible, the pure cinnabar will appear purple—this is called the \"Sacred Golden Sprout\" or the \"Transcendent Embryo Sacred Quartz.\"\n\nSelect the cinnabar and place the Fourfold Divine Elixir powder into a *qi* furnace, smelting it into a molten state. Pour it into a mold to form a gold container resembling two halves of a chicken egg. Then take two *liang* of raw cinnabar and eight *liang* of the nurtured cinnabar, grinding them together into fine powder. Place this into the container, sealing the seams with *liuyi* clay to prevent *qi* leakage. Apply another layer of *liuyi* clay one *cun* thick to the exterior. Allow it to dry, then place it in the movable firing crucible, centered in the ash without tilting. Seal the crucible’s seams with salt mud. Once dry, choose the first day of a *liu-jia* cycle. At dawn (*mao* hour), take one *jin* of thoroughly ignited fire, crush it, and place it evenly at the bottom of the crucible. Cover it lightly with warm ash, leaving two or three parts of fire exposed. At noon (*wu* hour), follow the same procedure as at dawn, adding another *jin* of fire. Repeat this at dusk (*you* hour) and midnight (*zi* hour), adding fire only during the four hours of *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you*. During the remaining eight hours (*chen*, *si*, etc.), brush away the ash from the fire, leaving only two or three parts of ash to allow the fire’s *qi* to gently heat the crucible.

Place it back into the container and, following the same procedure, nurture it with fire for forty-nine days to complete the cycle, producing the \"Returning Soul Sacred Gold Liquid.\" Open it, add another two *liang* of raw cinnabar, grind it finely, and place it into the container.

      "translated_text": "Make thirty pills from each *liang*. Offer them to the deities of heaven and earth, mountains and rivers, markets and wells, dragons and spirits, and the sages of the Three Realms. Once the offerings are complete, take four *liang* of mercury, one *sheng* of purified water, and one pill of the elixir, placing them into a new, clean iron crucible. Cover it with a clean vessel and set it over a charcoal fire, boiling until the water evaporates and the mercury dries, yielding \"Male Stone of Superior Fire.\" Melt one *jin* of silver, copper, iron, or tin in a furnace, then add one pill of the elixir, stirring until even. Pour it out to form an ingot, which will also become \"Male Stone of Superior Fire.\" If used for transmutation, it will not release fire-toxin. If consumed, it must first be detoxified. Seal it in a container and let it rest for one *fu*-period to dispel yin-toxin, then bury it three *chi* or one *zhang* underground, or suspend it in a well. Alternatively, expose it to sunlight for refinement.\n\nTo refine the Yellow Sprout: Take five *liang* of authentic native silver from mountains and marshes, hammer it into a disc shaped like the sun, and pound it a thousand times with an iron hammer to compact it thoroughly, preventing mercury from seeping into the Yellow Sprout. Place three *liang* of mercury in an amber vessel, then set the silver disc inside, leaving two *cun* of space above the mercury, ensuring it is level and properly positioned. Seal all seams with Six-One Mud. Place a water-filled vessel above to cover the amber vessel’s mouth, then invert it downward. Nurture it with three *liang* of charcoal fire continuously for seven days and nights. Upon opening, the mercury and silver will produce Yellow Sprouts like needles, all of which are white silver—this is the \"First Transformation Yellow Sprout.\" Add another three *liang* of mercury and nurture it for seven days and nights; upon opening, it will resemble the color of malt. Add another three *liang* of mercury and nurture it for seven days; upon opening, its color will deepen to yellow. Do not collect it yet—let it grow gradually, like wheat seedlings. After seven days, open the furnace and add three *liang* of mercury. By the completion of forty-nine days (seven cycles), a total of twenty-one *liang* of mercury will have been added, yielding the \"Purple Gold Yellow Sprout.\" Each transformation in the furnace produces different forms and colors. This Yellow Sprout is called the \"Mother of the Returning Elixir.\" The mercury remaining in the vessel will turn red like cinnabar, yielding two or three *liang*—this is called \"Child Longing for Mother\" or \"Single-Bodied Cinnabar.\" This medicine can be mixed with cow’s milk, steamed, ground into powder, and formed into pills with jujube pulp. Take three pills daily on an empty stomach with wine to replenish the lower *dantian*, calm the heart, stabilize the hun and po souls, and treat various wind-cold ailments. Its benefits are too numerous to list. The Yellow Sprouts growing on the surface can yield over twelve *liang*. The stubborn mercury beneath the silver disc, amounting to three or four *liang* that remains untransformed, is blackened due to excessive exposure—store it separately, as it has its own medicinal uses. The mercury Yellow Sprout can serve as the \"Mother of the Elixir,\" also called the \"Mother of the Returning Elixir.\" Cinnabar is the \"solar essence,\" while the mercury Yellow Sprout is the \"lunar spirit.\"\n\nA song says:\nThe sage seizes the mechanism of creation,\nHand-gathering sun and moon to place in the crucible and tripod.\n\nTo refine the Elixir: Take five *liang* of bright, fiery cinnabar lumps, mix them with three *sheng* of fine vinegar, and place them together in an iron cauldron. Suspend a cloth-wrapped \"embryo\" inside and boil for seven days and nights without extinguishing the fire. If the vinegar dries, replenish it. Once the vinegar is exhausted, remove the cinnabar, wash it clean with hot water, and wrap it in gold foil. Grind ink and apply it to the cinnabar, layering it to a thickness of half a *fen*, ensuring meticulous coating, then dry it over a gentle fire. Take five *liang* of fine gold and hammer it into a container capable of holding fifteen *liang* of material, ensuring it is neither damaged nor too thin. Grind fine ink into powder, mix it with egg white, and apply a half-*mi* thick layer inside the container. Then take *qingdai*, realgar, hematite, and chalcanthite, each one *fen*, grind them with vinegar into a paste, and coat the inside of the container. Next, grind the Yellow Sprout into powder, pack it tightly into the container, leaving one small opening. Place the cinnabar-wrapped \"embryo\" inside, like a mother nurturing a child, ensuring it remains undisturbed until the month is full and the elixir is born—no deviations allowed. Cover it entirely with Yellow Sprout powder, seal it with the container’s lid, and bind it tightly with hemp fiber to prevent movement. First, place it in warm ashes to dispel its yin-qi. Take one *jin* of refined saltpeter and four *liang* of saltpeter, melt them together in a crucible, then cool and grind into fine powder. Take ten *liang* of fine silver and hammer it into a large container capable of holding thirty *liang* of medicine. First, pack half of the saltpeter-salt mixture tightly into the silver container, then place the gold container at its center. Cover it with the remaining saltpeter-salt mixture, filling and packing it tightly. Bind it with hemp fiber, seal it completely with Six-One Mud to a thickness of one *cun*, and dry it thoroughly over a gentle fire. Dig a pit to form a furnace, fill it with ashes to create a basin, place the container inside, and cover its top with ashes. First, apply two *liang* of fire and nurture it for seven days. Then apply four *liang* of fire, ensuring it does not touch dead ashes.",

      "translated_text": "By the sixtieth day, apply six *liang* of fire and cease, then nurture it until the eighty-first day when the medicine is complete. Do not allow others to witness this, lest they disrupt the process. Next, remove the crucible and container, place them in a shallow furnace, and apply five *jin* of fire to heat them until glowing red, then stop. First, burn incense and make an invocation, then open the container. The medicine remains undamaged in its embryonic state, radiant, fragrant, and immaculate—beyond imagination. As if untouched by even gentle fire, this is called *sǎn*-processed elixir.\n\nTake a piece of cinnabar and place it in an iron pan, heating it over fire until it becomes like still oil, its brilliance indescribable. Then place mercury in a crucible, sprinkle it with powdered cinnabar, and the mercury will instantly dry into silver. If you place powdered cinnabar in a small bamboo tube and nestle it in warm ashes, heating it for a long while, it will also dry into silver, though slightly yellowed and not yet suitable for ingestion.\n\nNext, take fire-tamed cinnabar, remove its black impurities, and refine it all at once—the medicine will not diminish. Also, take five *liang* of realgar, the finest and most lustrous, free of impurities and resembling arrowheads. Seal it tightly. For cinnabar, use a piece of gold leaf, coat it with fine ink, mix it with the cinnabar, and nurture it for twenty-one days. Keep it in an ash basin with four *liang* of fire, cover it with *huangya*, seal it properly, and when the days are complete, remove it from the crucible. Place it in a shallow furnace, apply five *jin* of fire to heat it until glowing red, then withdraw the fire. Once cooled and opened, the realgar will appear like purple gold.\n\nTake a piece of realgar, grind it finely, and sprinkle it over one *liang* of mercury in a small pan. Apply three *liang* of fire, and the two substances will instantly dry, transforming into purple gold. If you wish to transmute silver, *yuyu*, *shimao*, or *danyang*, apply fire atop male stone—its potency is beyond measure.\n\nFor fire-tamed cinnabar (five *liang*), select an auspicious day for extraction and use it for ingestion. Grind it into powder, mix with jujube pulp to form pills—one *liang* of cinnabar makes one thousand pills. Begin consumption on a *jiazi* day, abstaining from meat and strictly avoiding sexual activity. First, perform hidden virtues for three years, make offerings to heaven and earth, and vow to cultivate compassion before ingesting. Regularly swallow saliva twenty-four times before taking three pills.\n\nBefore grinding the fire-tamed cinnabar, first take two *liang* of *yuganzi* and a handful of *hanfangji* and sweet bamboo, finely chop them, place them in the crucible, and boil with the cinnabar for one *fu* period. Remove and place in a double-layered silk bag, suspend it in a well or soak it in well water for seven days, then steam it with cow’s milk for the duration of one cooking. Only when the fire-toxin is fully expelled may it be formed into pills.\n\nTo instantly dry one *liang* of mercury into treasure, follow this method. For ingestion, consume only one spring each year, from the *jiazi* day for sixty days, taking three pills daily—totaling one hundred eighty pills. All illnesses will be dispelled in a year. With continued use, its effects are beyond description. If you wish to abstain from grains, drink a little cold water each morning. Once you obtain this elixir, even in midsummer, place a piece of raw meat with one pill atop it, and after a month, it will not spoil, its blood turning fresh and red. If dead flesh fares thus, how much more will a living person benefit, prolonging life?\n\nFire-tamed realgar, after a year, may be formed into pills with jujube pulp. Take one pill on an empty stomach with wine to cure all wind-cold and qi ailments—one pill suffices for permanent relief. If not for ingestion, place powdered realgar in a pan, insert a copper rod to create an opening, nestle it in an ash basin, wrap mercury in its surface, and nurture it with gentle fire for one *fu* period. The resulting yellow gold will be luminous, pure, and indescribably exquisite—also called *Zijin Heche* (\"Purple Gold River Chariot\"). *He* means \"to ferry across,\" and *che* means \"to bear,\" hence *Heche*. Its merits are beyond description. If intended for ingestion, expel the fire-toxin before consuming.\n\nCinnabar is called *Yinguzi* (\"Silver Valley Seed\"), and realgar is called *Jinguzi* (\"Gold Valley Seed\"). First refine *huangya* to produce *yongquan*. Take ten *liang* of *yongquan* and mix it with ten *liang* of raw mercury, grinding briefly until it forms cinnabar grains. Place it in a sealed crucible and nurture it with three *liang* of fire, regardless of duration. When ready, remove and dissolve it into treasure. Alternatively, add more mercury at any time, doubling the amount—this is called the *Zhengyang* Dao (\"True Yang Way\"). To make *Duti Danyang*, take one *liang* of *yongquan* to transmute one *jin*.\n\nWhen preparing, first take one *jin* of alum salt and one *jin* of mercury, grind them together, discard the black residue, and add *yongquan*. Wash the mercury with warm water until clean, then place it in the crucible. Keep the fire two fingers’ width from the bottom of the medicine crucible, nurturing it with three *liang* of fire day and night without interruption. The crucible should have a well-fitted lid—this is most effective. Avoid damage or cracks; a thick body is best.\n\n**Long-Life Real Person’s Cinnabar Formula**\nTake four *liang* of cinnabar in lumps, half a *jin* of green salt, and one *liang* of *quesha*. Grind the green salt separately into powder, mix with vinegar until slightly damp, and divide into four portions. Spread one portion at the bottom, layering cinnabar like lotus seeds planted in sand, then cover with one portion of roasted cinnabar. Next, cover with stone salt, then add another layer of cinnabar. Repeat this three times, then use the remaining portion to cover and press firmly. First seal the container with a tile, then place it in a furnace lined with four *cun* of ash.

      "translated_text": "Prolonged ingestion grants longevity, fallen teeth regrow, and if one can further refine the black *ding* into the elixir of immortality, one becomes a transcendent being. For transmutation, no need to remove the fire-toxin—use it directly.\n\n**Bone-Replacing, Form-Preserving, Snow-Descending Elixir**\nMeng Yaofu personally attested: I suffered from kidney-wind, lower-body itching, and hemorrhoids for over twenty years. After taking this elixir for a month, the ailments vanished entirely. After a hundred days of ingestion, the Three Corpses were expelled, my stride matched that of a galloping horse, my face and eyes radiated light, my teeth and hair renewed, and my complexion became like that of a maiden. Its divine efficacy defies full description. For transmutation, one pill subdues three *liang* of mercury, instantly forming supreme treasure.\n\n**Elixir Refinement Method**\nTake four *liang* of *chen* cinnabar and place it in a silver vessel. Boil with hundred-flower honey for seven full days and nights, then remove. Mix with ten *liang* of pine-resin powder and fine honey to a damp incense-like consistency. Line the bottom of a container, then plant the cinnabar like lotus roots, covering it with the remaining half. Seal the container firmly with Six-One mud. Once dry, place it in an ash bed and nurture with four *liang* of fire for three *fu* periods. When cool, remove the cinnabar, wash it clean, and cover each piece with gold foil. Take half a *jin* of *shizhonghuang*, pound it into fine powder, and spread half in a silver box, pressing firmly. Plant the cinnabar within, then cover with the remaining *shizhonghuang* powder, pressing tightly. Seal the seams with vinegar-mixed red halloysite. Place the box inside a large cauldron, encase it in gold-colored mica powder, and seal completely. Nurture in an ash bed with one *jin* of fire for three seven-day periods. When cool, retrieve it—it will resemble gold. For ingestion, place the elixir in a double-layered silk bag, suspend it in a well one *chi* above the water, and retrieve it after a night. Grind finely into powder, mix with the natural juice of fresh Solomon’s seal in a silver vessel, and simmer into a paste. Form into pills the size of *meng* beans. Take one pill daily on an empty stomach with well-flower water. For transmutation, do not remove the fire-toxin. Place one pill with three *liang* of mercury in a crucible, cover tightly with a dish, seal the edges with four layers of damp paper to prevent black *qi* leakage. Nurture in an ash bed with fire to form treasure. To produce yellow gold, add one *liang* each of realgar and Buddha’s-head blue to the fire-subdued cinnabar, grind into powder, and place in the previous container, sealing it completely. Also encase it in an outer container, nurture in an ash bed with one *jin* of fire for three seven-day periods, then calcine with a *cheng* of fire. When cool, retrieve it—it will be the color of purple gold. The silver box, touched by the elixir’s *qi*, will also turn yellow. Use this elixir to transmute mercury into top-grade yellow gold. Guard this secret closely.\n\n**Crimson-Snow, Flowing-Pearl Elixir Method**\nTake one *jin* of translucent, flawless realgar, pound and sift it, then moisten with vinegar. After two days, when dry, moisten again—repeat this ten times. Mix with white alum powder, then cover with alum and seal. After a day and night, dry over gentle fire, gradually increasing the heat but avoiding intensity. After another day and night, apply strong fire until the lower crucible glows like the fire itself, without allowing the fire’s strength to wane even momentarily. Burn thus for three days and nights, then cool for one *fu* period. Open the upper crucible to retrieve the refined essence, grind it finely, and combine with the residue from the lower crucible. Moisten with cooked rice and arrange as before. Refine with gentle and strong fire as previously, until the elixir glows brilliantly red, forming strands like hanging pearls or a spread net. Its radiance dazzles the eyes, startling the heart and spirit of all who see it. For sudden afflictions, near-death, or even apparent death, grind the elixir to the size of three or four sesame seeds, mix with egg yolk, and administer. The patient will raise their head upon ingestion, and recovery follows shortly. Minor malarial fevers are cured instantly. Its divine efficacy defies full description. Alas, the uninitiated hastily use it for gold-making.\n\n**Green Cinnabar Transmutation into Golden Millet Elixir Method**\nCures all wind ailments, extends life, preserves youth, heals myriad diseases, and enables transmutation. Use yellow lead, white clay, and tile powder, mixed with salt and vinegar into a hard mud. Shape wax into spherical molds, coat the spheres with the mud, ensuring no cracks. Dry in shade, then open a small hole and burn away the wax mold. Take fine, lustrous *chen* cinnabar, grind it into powder, roll in stiff paper, and pour into the sphere. Seal the hole with earthworm mud and let dry. Forge an iron ring to match the sphere’s shape, embed the sphere within, and place it in a cauldron, securing it so the top and bottom remain unobstructed. Pour lead-niter solution into the cauldron to a depth of two *cun*, then nurture with chaff fire, ensuring it does not cool. Wait until the lead melts. Maintain this for one hundred twenty days, increasing the fire, then remove and calcine on the ground. When cool, retrieve the elixir—it will resemble green-purple snail shells. Discard the black, unusable portions. Take half the elixir, place it in a green bamboo tube, seal it, and steam with milk five times, changing the milk thrice. The milk skin can treat wild goiter. Retrieve the elixir and bury it in a pit for three nights. Grind it into fine powder, mix with millet porridge, and form into millet-sized pills. Those aged forty take one pill, fifty take two, sixty take three—do not exceed this dosage. It cures all wind ailments and extends life while preserving youth. Place the remaining fine elixir powder in a crucible, layer it with one *liang* of fine alum powder above and below, and seal completely.",
      "overlap_context": " into powder. Cook jujubes and form into pills the size of *meng* beans. On a *jiachen* day, purify oneself, burn incense, and take one pill. Increase by one pill each day until the seventh day, then reduce by one pill, continuing this cycle of increase and decrease. After sixty days, effects will manifest, extending to a full year—one’s body will feel light and age will reverse. After three years, the complexion will resemble that of a child, and one’s pace will match that of a galloping horse.",

      "translated_text": "When the elixir is dry, place it in ashes to nurture for forty-nine days, then calcine with great fire. Once cool, open the vessel—all will have transformed into golden millet grains. Take one *sheng* of mouse-tail-shaped cinnabar and form it into a stick, then take three *liang* of *shushi* (ochre) and half a portion of true *geng* (lead). First melt the *geng* into liquid in a crucible, then add three or four grains of golden millet, which will transmute into true Western metal. The perforated ball must be placed with its hole facing upward inside the lead crucible, then nurtured with fire below.\n\n**Method for Refining *Geng* Powder:**\nTake ten *liang* of fine *geng* and fifty *liang* of mercury, place them in a porcelain jar, and keep warm with fire. Heat the *geng* until red-hot, then immerse it in mercury, stirring with a willow twig until the *geng* dissolves completely. Take three *jin* of *guan* flower (alum) and grind it finely with gold mud, then place it in a large cauldron and level it. Cover tightly with a basin, seal all around with mud to ensure airtightness, and calcine slowly until the mercury sublimes onto the basin—continue until the mercury is fully volatilized. Next, rinse with water to remove the *guan* flavor completely, then dry the refined *geng* powder in the sun. Grind it finely and incorporate it into the elixir.\n\nTake eight *liang* of cockscomb-shaped realgar, eight *liang* of lamellar orpiment, four *liang* of halite, ten *liang* of gold powder, and five *liang* of golden millet. Grind these five ingredients into a fine powder. Transfer them to a new crucible, following the previous method, and evenly coat the interior with ink ground from musk and rice vinegar. Place the elixir inside and heat with gentle and strong fire alternately until the elixir liquefies. Add four *liang* of finely ground nitre powder to the crucible, filling it tightly with thick paste. Seal the opening with paper, cover with a lid, and ensure it is airtight and dry. As before, place it in the crucible, seal it tightly, and pour molten lead over the vessel to a depth of two *cun*. Choose an auspicious day and begin firing at midnight during the *zi* hour, starting with six *liang* of fuel and increasing by one *liang* each day until sixty days are complete. Once cool, chisel open the vessel, remove the lead, and retrieve the crucible—the elixir will have turned the color of purple gold. Grind one *fen* of it finely in a mortar; it can transmute one *jin* of mercury into gold instantly. This is not something ordinary people can obtain—it is a secret transmission from the immortals. If used to aid the Dao, one must know contentment.\n\n**Coating *Geng*:**\nGrind one *liang* of green vitriol, five *qian* of white alum, three *qian* of salt, and eight *qian* of saltpeter into a fine powder. Knead sweet clay into a trough, shape the *geng* into hairpins, dip them in water, then roll them in the powder mixture. Place them in the trough and heat over fire. Remove and dip in a water basin—repeat this process five times to achieve a superior, jewel-like color.\n\n**Tai Xu Ling Sha Dan (Elixir of Supreme Void Numinous Cinnabar)**\nThe *Dongxuan Ji* states: \"Refine the Nine Cycles of Golden Liquid Dragon-Tiger Great Elixir.\" Ge Xianweng of the *Baopuzi* said: \"The method for the Supreme Clarity Divine Elixir originates from the Primordial Lord, who was the teacher of Laozi and the greatest of celestial deities. He harmonizes yin and yang, commands wind and rain, rides clouds and dragons, and all the immortals of heaven are subject to him. Even my own study of the Dao has been achieved through the ingestion of this elixir. The superior adept who obtains it becomes an official of heaven; the middling adept dwells in the mountains; the lesser adept enjoys longevity in the world. Foolish people do not believe in it, dismissing it as empty words. From morning to night, they seek only the means of death, never pursuing life—how could heaven force life upon them? Most people crave only fine food, beautiful clothes, music, sensual pleasures, wealth, and honor. Indulging their passions and desires, they treat life lightly, hastening their demise. Take care not to speak of the golden elixir to such people, lest they mock the Dao and slander the truth. Do not transmit the elixir scriptures to those who are not of noble character; only to those of sincere faith may they be passed on.\"\n\nHe further instructed his disciples: \"According to the *Huangdi Jiuding Shendan Jing*, the Yellow Emperor ascended as an immortal by ingesting it. Breathing exercises and herbal medicines can only prolong life and cure illness—they cannot prevent death. If one wholeheartedly consumes the divine elixir, one’s lifespan becomes boundless, enduring as long as heaven and earth. One may ride clouds and dragons to ascend to the Great Clarity—all due to this divine elixir. Yixuanzi warns: This Dao is of utmost importance and must be transmitted only to the worthy. Even if someone amasses gold like mountains, do not speak of this to them. Those without immortal bones must also not be allowed to know of it. If those who do not believe in the Dao learn of it, they will not only slander the divine elixir but also prevent its successful refinement. Only those with immortal bones and sincere faith in the elixir Dao may, after the elixir is completed, ascend as immortals with their entire households. Yet people today do not believe in the divine elixir, preferring instead to trust in herbal medicines. But herbs, once buried, decay—how can they grant longevity when ingested? Cinnabar is the substance of immortality; when refined and consumed, how could it not extend life? The masses of the world are foolish and ignorant, craving only wealth and indulging their desires, seeking nothing but death. How could they know that those who cultivate the truth dwell in the world yet transcend it, restraining themselves and pledging their hearts to the pursuit of attainment? If gentlemen who savor the Dao have aspirations in this regard, to together propagate the mystery of the Way—is this not wonderful?\"\n\n**Sun Zhenren’s Elixir Scripture: Chapter on the Five Metals and Eight Minerals**\n**Five Metals:** Cinnabar, mercury, realgar, orpiment, sulfur.\n**Eight Minerals:** Azurite, malachite, chalcanthite, arsenic, borax, white alum, white vitriol, nitre.\n\nThe five metals die when encountering mercury; the eight minerals perish when meeting nitre. Cinnabar, realgar, and orpiment are called \"sentient substances,\" each with distinct uses. *Sengxi* yellow, *shiting* fat, and sweet sulfur are three substances with different names but the same nature.

      "translated_text": "**Section on Cinnabar (from the Five Metals)**\nCinnabar is both water and fire. Take eight taels of fine, genuine cinnabar and place it in a smooth, new porcelain vessel. Pack the vessel’s rim with damp earth to prevent smoke from escaping. Take eight taels of mercury and five *haima* (sea horses), grind them to powder, and mix evenly with the cinnabar and mercury. Next, take fine *chige* (red grass) stalks, half-dried, burn them to ash, and place the ash in an earthen jar. Pour water over it to leach the liquid, then use a cast-iron cauldron with a frost-like patina on its base. Line the bottom and cover the top of the porcelain vessel with this, and heat it with gentle and strong fire until the vessel gradually warms. Then apply intense fire to calcine it, melt it into liquid, and remove it to form white cinnabar. Place it in a tripod over a furnace, following the methods in the previous elixir scriptures: weigh the proportions precisely, arrange them according to yin-yang positions, and cycle them in accordance with the *Can Tong Qi* (Token for the Agreement of the Three). Align with the four seasons, eight solar terms, twenty-four qi phases, seventy-two pentads, and the celestial patterns of years, months, days, and hours—without the slightest error. Nurture it gently, like a hen brooding eggs, for one hundred twenty days. Remove it, grind it into fine powder, and form pills with *chuanbanxia* (pinellia) juice, each the size of a millet grain. Consuming one pill extends life by three hundred years; ten pills, three thousand years. Its power transforms the intestines, and it is called *Shenfu Baixue Dan* (Divine Talisman White Snow Elixir), excelling at transmuting blood into milk. If one encounters a perfected being who points to the true qi of the Mysterious Female and the One, and can stabilize the embryo and preserve the spirit, ascension is certain within three years. The elixir’s inner workings follow the rhythms of heaven and earth, aligning with the four seasons—this is the principle of the first transformation. With this, all silver, gold, and minerals from mountains and marshes can be instantly transmuted into supreme treasures. If the elixir is used to refine mercury, it will subdue its volatility and transmute it into treasure. Stirring it fifty or sixty times in one place can turn base gold into the finest treasure. This elixir is called *Shenfu Baixue* (Divine Talisman White Snow) among the great elixirs. The superior person values life over wealth; the inferior, wealth over life. This elixir must not be transmitted to the unworthy.\n\n**Section on Realgar (from the Five Metals)**\nRealgar originates from Wudu Mountain, embodying the qi of metal and wood. Take fine, deep red realgar resembling a rooster’s comb, and grind it to a fine powder. Use high-quality *guming* (bright) green vitriol, *zijin* (purple gold), *longya* (dragon sprouts), and the frost-like stalks of *chige* (red grass, also called *chige*). Layer these seven substances in a new porcelain jar, placing the elixir inside. Cover it and heat with gentle and strong fire, gradually increasing the intensity. Then apply intense fire until it sweats, remove the top, and place it on stone for three days until it turns gold-red. Return it to the porcelain jar and nurture it with chaff fire for nine days. Remove it, melt mountain silver into liquid gold, and use the elixir to transmute it—it will instantly become treasure, with a ten-thousand-fold success rate.\n\n**Section on Orpiment (from the Five Metals)**\nOrpiment also comes from Wudu Mountain, embodying the qi of metal and wood. Take fine, golden orpiment resembling *yueye* (moon leaves), grind it to a fine powder, and combine it with high-quality bright green vitriol, *yimucao* (motherwort), *yiwushou* (black nightshade), and *longyacao* (dragon sprouts). Burn these to ash, leach the liquid, and boil it into a frost-like paste. Layer it in a new porcelain jar, place the elixir inside, cover it, and heat with gentle and strong fire, gradually increasing the intensity. Then apply intense fire to calcine it until the smoke ceases and it melts into liquid. This can transmute fine mountain silver into supreme treasure.\n\n**Section on Sulfur (from the Five Metals)**\nFor sulfur, use sweet sulfur, *sengxi* yellow, or *shiting* fat—three substances with different names but the same nature. Use fine, bright, crystalline green vitriol, or burn *chige* (red grass) to ash, leach the liquid, and boil it into frost. Layer it in a new porcelain jar, place the elixir inside, cover it, and heat with gentle and strong fire, gradually increasing the intensity. Then apply intense fire to destroy it until the smoke ceases and it melts into liquid. This can transmute silver into treasure.\n\n**Section on White Superior Yellow (from the Five Metals)**\nWhite Superior Yellow originates from the peaks of Shangdang Mountain, resembling red powder in color. Next, use fine cinnabar, transparent as crystal—the foremost among the five metals. Take *chige* (red grass) ash, *zijin* (purple gold), *longya* (dragon sprouts), and *huangqin* (skullcap), burn them to ash, leach the liquid, and boil it into frost. Layer it in a new porcelain jar, place the elixir inside, cover it, and heat with gentle and strong fire, gradually increasing the intensity. Then apply intense fire to calcine it until the smoke ceases and it melts into liquid. This can transmute raw iron and copper into treasure, and refine mercury into treasure as well.\n\n**Section on Azurite (from the Eight Minerals)**",

The methods for the Five Metals and Eight Minerals refine cinnabar and gold, transmute various substances, and subdue the Five Metals.\n\n**Methods for Subduing the Five Metals**\n**Subduing Cinnabar (Primary Method)**\n*Method for Subduing Cinnabar with Herbs (from the* Purple Empyrean Elixir Classic *of Master Ge)*\nTake cinnabar in lumps, regardless of quantity, wrap it in sheep’s tripe grass, collect and dry it, also without fixed amount. Grind it thoroughly into powder. In a porcelain container, first place half the powder, then arrange the cinnabar in the center, and cover it with the remaining powder, packing it tightly. Calcine it with three to five catties of charcoal fire until evenly heated, then use it.\n\n**Method for Subduing Cinnabar into Silver**\nTwo taels of alum powder, one qian of saltpeter powder, a small amount of *jinchi* (golden wings), and one tael of cinnabar. Grind these ingredients into powder. First melt one and a half taels of *pengsha* (borax) in a spoon until half-cooked, then grind it into powder before adding the other medicinal powders. Grind them together, place in a tea bowl, and simmer over low heat, then grind again into powder. Coat each piece of cinnabar by holding it in the mouth, then apply the medicinal powder. Take one and a half taels of mountain-refined silver, hammer it into two round sheets. Place one sheet at the bottom of a porcelain container, arrange the cinnabar pieces, and scatter silver bits the size of barley grains among them. Cover with the other sheet, fill the gaps with silver, and seal tightly with Six-One Mud. Once dry, calcine first with gentle fire, then with strong fire until red-hot. Cool, then place in the Flower Pool to refine into treasure.\n\n**Method for Subduing White Cinnabar**\nEqual parts of *jvnücao* (maiden grass), *gansui* (kan-sui), *xusuizi* (caper spurge), and *woju* (lettuce). Grind them into powder, place one qian of the herbal powder in a container, then arrange the cinnabar, cover it with the remaining powder, seal tightly, and heat with gentle and strong fire for one *fu* period.\n\n**Method for Subduing Cinnabar**\nFive taels of silver powder, five taels of fine cinnabar, and eight gold leaves. In a porcelain container, first place four gold leaves, then a layer of silver powder, then arrange the cinnabar in the center. Alternate layers of silver powder and cinnabar until all are used, then fill the gaps with lead powder and oyster shell powder, seal tightly, and dry.

      "translated_text": "**Method for Refining Cinnabar with Herbs**\n*Dìdǎn* grass, *zhāngliǔ*, *dàjǐ* (kan-sui), *sháoyào* (peony), *jiǎndāo* grass, and *mǎchǐ* grass. Take equal parts of the fresh herbs listed above, pound them into a paste, place the cinnabar in the center, and seal tightly. Once dry, calcine with two to three catties of charcoal fire until it melts into liquid.\n\n**Herbal Method for Subduing Cinnabar**\nRemove the roots of *mǎchǐ* (purslane) and *wǔfāng* grass. Place three taels of cinnabar in a porcelain container: first lay a layer of herbs, then arrange the cinnabar, and cover with another layer of herbs. Seal tightly and calcine with fire.\n\n**Method for Subduing Cinnabar**\nOne tael of cinnabar and one tael of white alum. First spread half of the alum in a crucible and melt it into liquid, then place the cinnabar, and cover with the remaining alum. Arrange all layers, then calcine with fire until thoroughly red.\n\n**Method for Subduing Cinnabar into Metal (Jīn)**\nHalf a catty of fine *shénjǐn* cinnabar, half a tael each of yellow alum, *shídǎn* (chalcanthite), *jīguān* realgar, and *pào shā* (calcined cinnabar). Grind all into powder, mix with rice vinegar into a paste, and boil in a porcelain pot until slightly bubbling—this suffices. Boil for ten days or more; if the cinnabar remains unchanged, it is ready. If not, continue boiling until subdued by fire. Form into glutinous rice-sized pills. For every tael of mercury, place one pill in a vessel, nurture with four taels of fire for one tea period, and it will become a treasure.\n\n**Method for Refining and Subduing Cinnabar into Supreme Treasure Medicine**\nTake one tael of fine cinnabar, the size of dice, wrap it in two layers of gold foil, and place it in a porcelain container. Line the bottom and cover the top with *jiǔzhuǎn* subdued-fire refined salt as a protective layer, filling and pressing firmly. Evenly cover with oyster shell powder, seal properly, and first nurture with one tael of fire from the *chén* hour (7–9 AM) to the *wǔ* hour (11 AM–1 PM), then increase the fire to three catties until red-hot. Allow to cool, open the container, remove the oyster shell first, then retrieve the cinnabar—now subdued by fire. If the cinnabar retains its original color, it is ready as a protective layer, purged of fire toxins, and suitable for consumption. Form into sesame-sized pills with honey; ingestion prolongs life. If reused in a container, wrap the cinnabar in gold or silver foil, nurture with fire for twenty-one days, and it will fully become treasure—gold foil yields metal (jīn), silver foil yields silver.\n\n**Nine-Turn Method for Subduing Mercury with Cinnabar**\nTake five taels of fine cinnabar and gather moss from the shady side of an old wall, drying and grinding it into powder. Grind the cinnabar into powder, place it in an oil-permeable container, lining the bottom and covering the top with moss powder. Mix earthworm castings and salt into a paste, seal the container with a layer one finger thick, and let dry. Place it on a *bó* (clay support), calcine with one catty of fire until red-hot. Once cool, remove and break into lumps—its color will be purplish-red. Grind into powder again and calcine as before; its color will deepen. Without pressing, it will later transform into a purplish-red hue, lustrous as a mirror reflecting people. Repeat the process nine times, and it becomes suitable for consumption, prolonging life—this is the *jiǔzhuǎn* cinnabar protective layer.\n\n**Master Dīng’s Precious Crucible Method for Subduing Cinnabar**\nFive taels of fine cinnabar, ground into powder. One tael of *jiēzhōu* rock salt powder and two taels of *Qín* soil from outside the east gate of Fengxiang, both ground into powder. Separately, use clay to form a crucible base, shaping it like a *gān* crucible, ensuring it is smooth. Pound and extract the natural juice from the stems and leaves of purple-stemmed lettuce, mix it with the previously prepared salt powder and *Qín* soil, stirring until even and of proper consistency. Coat the crucible base with this mixture to form a *gān* crucible, about five *fēn* thick. If not firm enough, add paper and pound until well-mixed, then reshape. Remove the base, dry thoroughly over a gentle fire, fill the crucible’s mouth with cinnabar, and tightly pack a bundle of purple-stemmed lettuce stems to seal it, preventing gas escape. Leave about half the space above, tie the bundle securely with thread, and place the crucible on a *bó* with a small central depression to hold it steady. Surround with fire and calcine until thoroughly red-hot, then cease when smoke dissipates. Remove from fire, let cool, and the cinnabar will resemble amber in color and luster, luminous enough to reflect people—suitable for consumption and life extension. To refine further into a protective layer, repeat the process three to five times; each turn enhances its brilliance, weight, and spiritual efficacy, the details of which cannot be fully described. It subdues all mineral medicines, transforming them as desired. Only the *Three Yellows* (sulfur, realgar, orpiment) resist alteration; calcining requires at least two catties of fire. This method was once presented to Commander Wang of the Gold and Feather Guard.\n\n**Master Sūn’s Alchemical Classic: Various Methods for Subduing Cinnabar**\n\n**Method for Subduing Cinnabar with Stone Yellow**\nFour taels of cinnabar and one catty of *shímiáo* (stone sprouts). Grind both into fine powder, place in a cinnabar or porcelain container to about half its capacity, and press firmly. Insert a wooden mold, pack *shíhuáng* (stone yellow) around it, then remove the mold. Lightly moisten the cinnabar with water and roll it in borax. Fill the cavity with *shízhōnghuáng* (stone-center yellow), cover with *shíhuáng*, seal tightly, and let dry. Bury in a one- to two-*chǐ* deep pit, fill with dry horse manure, and burn for two seven-day periods, replenishing the manure to maintain uninterrupted fire. After the full duration, apply three catties of fire on top until fully calcined. Once cool, retrieve it—its color will be peach-blossom red, melting into a treasure for any use.\n\n**Method for Subduing Fire with Cinnabar**\nUse cinnabar in nuggets, any quantity. First, grind purple-skinned garlic into a paste and evenly coat the inside of a new *gān* crucible to a thickness of about one finger. Line the bottom with *gǒuqǐ* (goji) leaves, mix the cinnabar with garlic paste, place it in the crucible, cover with another layer of *gǒuqǐ* leaves, and press firmly with garlic paste. Seal the mouth with a tile, coat with red clay, and reinforce with paper-fiber mortar to a uniform thickness of one finger.",

      "translated_text": "Allow to dry in the shade, then place in an ash pit and nurture with civil and martial fire for one *fu* period. Apply ten catties of fire until fully calcined. Once cool, retrieve and heat the cinnabar over fire until red, then quench in saltwater until the desired color is achieved—this subdues the fire. If the cinnabar crumbles upon biting, reseal as before and apply five catties of fire to complete the process.\n\n**Method for Subduing White Cinnabar**\nBoil two taels of Sichuan pepper in one *sheng* of water until reduced to half. Cool the liquid. Grind one tael of silver foil into powder, combine with four *qian* of mercury, and pound with the pepper into a paste. Strain through raw silk to extract the mercury paste. Adjust the size and quantity of cinnabar nuggets to form cakes of one tael each, then chew thoroughly in the mouth. Use seven cloves to assess the cinnabar in the mouth, then sandwich it between two mercury paste cakes, ensuring even thickness. Mix equal parts of cassia bark, white aconite, *wasong* (moss on tiles), Sichuan pepper, and lotus leaves into a powder. Sprinkle half into a container to form a nest for the cinnabar cakes. For ingestion, apply a layer of yellow lead (*huangdan*) about one *qian* thick, place the cinnabar on top, and cover with another *qian* of yellow lead. Fill the container with the remaining powder, seal the seams with red halloysite mixed with vinegar, and reinforce with mortar to a uniform thickness. Calcine with half a *chen* of charcoal fire to produce white cinnabar (omit the yellow lead if not needed).\n\n**Method for Boiling Cinnabar into a Treasure**\nTake five leaves of *jingfeng* grass, one tael each of sour nuggets and cinnabar. Place each in a silk bag, tie securely, and dip halfway in rice vinegar. Place in an iron vessel with half a *jin* of rice vinegar, two *sheng* of water, and two taels of *mu furong* (hibiscus) branches and leaves. Boil for one *fu* period over a slow fire. Remove, drain, and select the cinnabar, discarding the rest.\n\n**Another Method for Refining Cinnabar**\nMelt three taels of cinnabar in a crucible until liquefied, using a slow fire. Once fully molten and boiling, pour onto the ground, collect the cinnabar, and return it to a *gan* crucible. Heat until it smokes and liquefies again, then pour into a bran trough to form silver.\n\n**Zhang Zihou’s *Grass-Seeing Treasure Elixir* Method**\n**First Boiling Method**\nGrind two taels each of *yangti* root, *diding*, *you* grass, *didancao*, and *yimucao* into coarse powder. Use one *dou* and five *sheng* of river water to boil eight taels of bright cinnabar (avoid finely crushed or impure pieces) with the herbs in a silver or stone vessel, suspended above the liquid. Boil for one *fu* period, maintaining a gentle simmer like fish eyes. Replenish water as needed, then rinse the cinnabar with river water after boiling.\n\n**Second Calcining Method and Fire Nurturing**\nGrind two taels each of *songluo*, *diyu*, *baihuacai*, and *yindijue* into powder. Mix with raw honey to a consistency like moist incense. Spread one-third of the mixture on the bottom of a container, arrange the cinnabar like lotus seeds without touching, and cover with another layer of the mixture. Repeat until all cinnabar and powder are used, pressing firmly on top. Seal the seams with red halloysite mixed with vinegar, then coat the entire vessel with *liuyi* mud to a thickness of one finger. Allow to dry in the shade, ensuring no cracks; if any appear, patch with mud. Cover with a three-finger-thick layer of vinegar-mixed grass ash, pressing firmly. Place five catties of charcoal beneath, ignite from the top, and calcine until half is consumed. Add another five catties, then another five catties once half is consumed again. When nearly half remains, cover with a basin overnight. Retrieve the cinnabar, place in a clean sand container, seal the seams with red halloysite, and set in a small earthen jar. Elevate with a three-legged iron stand, bury in paper-money ash to a depth of four fingers above the container. At the *zi* and *wu* hours, add four taels of mature fire. Nurture for two seven-day periods, then apply a strong fire to fully calcine without losing the true subdued fire. For ingestion, grind into fine powder, form into *tongzi*-sized pills with pinellia paste, and take on an empty stomach with warm water. For transmutation or storage, boil three times, replacing the herbs each time, and follow the previous fire-nurturing method. For transmutation, form into pills with paper mulberry juice—ten pills per tael, each pill transmuting one tael of copper into treasure. For storage, mix three *qian* of silver and seven *qian* of mercury, grind into cinnabar, and divide into ten pills. Use eight taels of previously calcined cinnabar as a base powder, spreading half on the bottom and half on top. Follow the initial cinnabar-nurturing method: first nurture for twenty-one days, then reduce by one day each time until the fire is vigorous, nurturing for only one *fu* period to form the supreme treasure—this is the *Elixir of Longevity*.\n\n**Method for Subduing Cinnabar with Half-Tael Coins (from *Xuanzhenzi’s Concordance Records*)**\nTake any quantity of half-tael coins, heat each until thoroughly red, then quench in vinegar. Coat the coins with sulfur powder after wetting with warm water, place in a container, and cover with more sulfur powder. Seal, allow to dry, then cover the top. Nurture with four taels of fire for three days, then calcine until fully red. Cool, grind finely, and use to subdue cinnabar following the previous fire-nurturing method. Store as an elixir. For subdued cinnabar, add raw cinnabar—more is better, especially if using high-quality mother cinnabar.\n\n**Method for Subduing Cinnabar**\nLine a container with bamboo and seal. Calcine with a strong fire until thoroughly red, then cool and retrieve. Do not nurture. Use two taels of arsenic trioxide, half a tael of *fen shuang* (calomel), one tael of *hanshuishi* (calcium sulfate), one tael of *jin fan* (alum), and one *fen* of saltpeter.",

Take equal parts of the above, pound while moist into a paste, then mix with one *liang* of mercury. Fire with one to two *jin* of fuel until red-hot, then cool and remove the vessel. Take three *liang* of frost-white *yimucao*, blend with water, and place the cinnabar within. Fire with three to five *jin* of fuel, and it becomes a treasure.\n\n**Three Grades of Minor Return Elixir: Method for Restraining Mercury**\n*Xuanhu*, reed catkins, and bright cinnabar mercury—five *liang* each. Grind the above together, place in a crucible, and pack tightly with halite. Moisten the mouth to level it, then use an iron pick to pierce five to seven holes the size of chopsticks. Insert a perforated tile over the crucible’s mouth, sinking it about one *cun* deep. Center a hole in the tile and seat it atop a flat-bottomed water vessel, ensuring all seams are sealed. Once dry, surround it with charcoal, starting with half a *jin* and increasing to three *jin*. After one *fu* period, when the crucible glows the same color as the fire, the mercury will descend entirely into the small vessel—five *liang* each. No refining is lost, and both mercury and medicine turn thoroughly red.\n\nTake this medicine again, then take fifteen *liang* of sal ammoniac, first melt it to an oily consistency, stir until clear, and grind to powder. Wrap in alum paper, then take ten parts of calcined lead powder and place it in a tripod as an outer vessel. Inside, use one *jin* of purple fluorite powder, center a golden *niaozi*, and cover it above and below with purple fluorite powder. Top with calcined lead, packing tightly. Gradually expel all yin qi until dry. Seal the tripod with its lid, then reinforce the seal. Once thoroughly dry, place it in the furnace with one *jin* of fire, maintaining it for sixty days without interruption. If the fire wanes, extend by five days. This is called *Purple Gold Sand*. Then take one *liang*, grind to powder, and place ten *liang* of mercury in a cauldron. Cover with the powdered medicine for three days, then seal tightly with an iron lid, embedding its edges. Apply sixty *liang* of fire above and four *liang* below. After three *fu* periods, it naturally forms a sheet of silver, ready for use.\n\nAgain, grind all the previous medicine into powder. Take half a *jin* of sal ammoniac, return it to the vessel, and cover as before. Seal and dry, then fire for sixty days—this is called *Purple Spirit Sand*. As before, take one *liang* of the medicine, grind to powder, and cover one *jin* of mercury. Seal firmly, and within a day it transforms into a cauldron of silver.\n\nGrind all into powder again, mix with half a *jin* of cinnabar, and stir into sand. Follow the previous method, nurturing it for sixty days—this is called the *Minor Return Elixir*. One *liang* makes five hundred pills; each pill, when applied to one *er* of dry mercury, instantly becomes silver.\n\n**Another Method for Restraining Mercury**\nHeat one *liang* of mercury intensely, then drop in one pill of the medicine. The pill darts across the mercury’s surface in all directions, then sinks. The mercury dries instantly. Remove the pill, pour the mercury into a trough, and once cooled, it becomes silver, ready for use.\n\nForm this medicine into pills and consume them to attain longevity, sharing the lifespan of heaven and earth. Carrying one pill of this elixir into the wilderness causes all beasts to submit; birds become phoenixes, dogs become dragons. Those who consume it achieve immortality—this is the *Minor Return Elixir*, transcending great calamities and ranking first among immortals’ arts.\n\n*Song:*\nIf white gold is achieved, the world may be delivered;\nIf white gold fails, one’s efforts are in vain.\nThose who encounter this method\nAre destined by past lives to have immortal affinity,\nTheir names recorded in the celestial registers.\nWithout the ladder to immortality,\nOne would never meet this elixir to consume.\n\n**Method for Subduing Mercury with Green Cloth**\nSpread *dijin* to form a thatched mat. Use only lotus flowers, water chestnut leaves, pagoda tree pods, *yuanzhi*, and gallnuts—never let women know when compounding.\n\nTake the following in equal parts: *dijin*, *mao’er yancao*, lotus flowers, lotus leaves, pagoda tree pods, *yuanzhi*, and gallnuts—one *liang* each—and grind to powder. First line the bottom of a crucible with *dijin*, then spread *mao’er yancao* powder (quantity as needed). Place mercury inside, then cover completely with lotus flowers, lotus leaves, pagoda tree pods, gallnuts, and *yuanzhi*. Seal the crucible’s mouth with a tile, then seal the exterior with two *cun* of mud. Dry in the shade, then fire with five *jin* of charcoal. Dispel fire toxins overnight. The next day, break the crucible to find the mercury solidified into lumps, ready for use.\n\n**Method for Nurturing Green-Gold Heads into Silver with a Herb Vessel**\nEight *qian* of mercury, three *qian* of sulfur, one *qian* of alum, three *qian* of *mu*. Grind to powder.\n\nFirst, slowly stir-fry mercury, sulfur, and alum over low fire to form sand. Then take equal parts of *baiyou*, *baiqian*, Sichuan pepper, Sichuan aconite, *xixin*, and purslane, grind to fine powder, and pound into a paste. Line the inside of a crucible with this paste, adhering it to the walls. Place the green-gold sand inside, then cover with *shanze* powder. Seal with a tile, then coat the exterior with *liuyi* mud one finger thick. Dry in the shade, patching cracks as they form. Once dry, place in a large earthenware or iron pot atop a trivet. Set the medicine ball inside, then nurture the top with *jinsu* fire, maintaining four *liang* of charcoal to keep it warm. The base should remain consistently warm—reduce if too hot, add if too cool. Nurture thus for three days until firm, then apply strong fire. Once cooled, remove the ball and shake it; if it rattles, the substance is complete.\n\n**Sun the Perfected’s Scripture’s Herb Method for Subduing Mercury**\nLotus leaves and *lutí*.

      "translated_text": "**Additional Methods**\n\n**Method One**\nCastor leaves, white oxalis with three corners, *hanlian* (eclipta), *dìdīng* (viola), *jinlian* (potentilla), *xùtiān* (cynanchum), and *yúxīngcǎo* (houttuynia)—or use purslane. Grind these to a fine powder, except for purslane, which should be mashed. Then grind with mercury in a mortar, cover with the five herbs, and nurture over ash fire until faint smoke rises. Before completion, pour into water to soften the sand, then remove and wrap in paper. For every *liang* of purslane and mercury, the result will be a pellet the size of a bullet.\n\n**Method Two**\n*Dàotuíténg* (inverted vine, *Datura* flower) and *tiěchángcǎo* (iron-intestine grass). Dry these two ingredients in the shade, grind to powder, and mix with one cup of water in an iron pan. Simmer over gentle and strong fire until dry, then stir-fry until the herbs turn to ash. Pour the already-formed mercury sand into the palm and roll into a single lump.\n\n**Method for Subduing Mercury into Western Sand**\nOne *liang* of mercury, one *qián* of *dǎnfán* (chalcanthite), two *qián* of high-quality *qīngfán* (melanterite), and a soybean-sized piece of *hūshā* (sal ammoniac). Grind these together into a fine powder, add two *qián* of *lóngdǎncǎo* (gentian) powder, and mix thoroughly. Stew with one cup of sour *zǎo* (jujube) juice in an iron pan for the duration of two meals, until dry. Avoid vigorous boiling; let the edges simmer gently for two hours. Lift with a bamboo stick—when it resembles silk floss, remove and wrap the residue in paper. If the sand is incomplete, continue stewing as before. Cover with a bowl and store overnight; by the next day, it will turn red. The pan must be new and unused for best results; avoid grease.\n\n**Sealing and Refining Method**\n*Lúgānshí* (calamine) with star-like patterns, *dàizhěshí* (hematite), and alum in equal parts. Grind these three into a fine powder and place in a crucible. Position the mercury sand in the center and cover it completely with the powder. Then mix *chìshízhī* (red halloysite) and clam powder with water into a stiff paste to seal the crucible’s mouth, ensuring it is thoroughly airtight. Refine with one *jīn* of charcoal fire. When the blue smoke nearly dissipates, remove, let cool, and open to reveal the treasure.\n\n**Another Method**\nFive *liǎng* of mercury, five *liǎng* of *dǎnfán*, five *liǎng* of *qīngfán*, and three and a half *liǎng* of white alum. Grind these into a fine powder. Place the mercury in an iron pan and cover it with the three alum powders. Apply gentle and strong fire on a wind furnace, adding one large bowl of *zǎo* juice. Warm the juice first, then pour it into the pan one cup at a time. To produce *gēng* sand, add five *liǎng* of *lóngdǎncǎo* powder to the alums before stewing. Alternatively, decoct *lóngdǎncǎo* separately into a thick juice, pour into the pan, and stew with the *zǎo* juice to form *gēng* sand. During stewing, maintain a gentle simmer; avoid vigorous boiling at the edges to prevent mercury from spilling. When the edges are dry, remove and let cool. Gently brush aside the alum, pour the sand into a crucible, wash it clean, and let it sit overnight before it turns red. Only then is it ready for the sealing process.\n\n**Method for Subduing Mercury into Western Sand**\nThree *qián* of *mǔ* (mother metal), hammered into foil and cut into pieces. Seven *qián* of mercury, ground with pepper decoction as in the *gǎnqì* method. Then use the following herbs—*máojuǎn* (reed roll), *xiāngtiānquè fěn* (unknown powder), and *wúmíngyì* (pyrolusite)—ground into fine powder, mixed with honey into a paste, and wrapped in cloth. Fry in four *liǎng* of hempseed oil, adding forty-nine *guāzǐ* (melon seeds) one by one until they turn brown. Continue until two-thirds of the oil remains. Clean with a toothbrush to remove excess oil, then store in a sealed container.\n\n**Method for the Mercury-Transforming Bone Elixir**\n*Bìlì* (fig vine), *xiàkūcǎo* (prunella), *yúxīngcǎo* (houttuynia), white *hànlián* (eclipta), and *mùmántóu* (Chinese gall). Grind these into fine powder, refine with honey, and form into pills. Press a hollow in the center of each pill, place mercury inside, and seal the opening with a pinch of salt. Press the pills flat into a bowl, cover top and bottom, and seal the rim with clam powder mixed with vinegar. Further secure with damp paper strips. Then drive three iron nails into the ground to form a tripod, surround with charcoal fire, and cover the bowl with a *dǒu* of dry chaff. Do not fan the fire. By the next day, let cool and remove—the mercury will have congealed. Stew three black plums in three bowls of water, then pour the decoction over the elixir in an iron ladle until it turns white. Melt again in a sand crucible, pour into a mold, dust with wall dust, sprinkle with saltpeter, and return to the crucible. Pour the liquid to form the treasure.\n\n**Method for the Mercury-Congealing Sand Elixir**\nMercury in any quantity, a small amount of *yínmǔ* (silver mother), *jìjiè* (schizonepeta), *qúmài* (dianthus), *huálú* (unknown), and red pepper. Grind these into a coarse powder and gradually add to a pan while stir-frying. When the herbs blacken, remove and discard them. Strain the remaining mixture through double-layered silk. Any untransformed residue should be processed again. For extraction, use *luógēn* (radish root) and one bowl of good vinegar, suspend in a silk bag, and stew in a bottle overnight. Then take a large *nánxīng* (arisaema), mix the mercury and silver powder with honey, place in a star-shaped mold, sprinkle with a small amount of *péngshā* (borax) and *yánghuā* (genkwa) powder on top, cover with more star powder, and seal the mouth with *huángdān* (lead oxide). Secure with toilet paper and clay, let dry, then nurture with *zǐmǔ* (mother-child) fire overnight. At dawn, refine with charcoal fire.\n\n**Another Method**\nOne bowl of *zhāngliǔ* (unknown) juice and one *liǎng* of *fěnshuāng* (calomel). Wrap in silk and stew until the juice is exhausted. Use three *qián* of silver and one *liǎng* of powder to evenly coat. Place in a black bottle with three peppercorns at the bottom, pack the medicine tightly, then add four Sichuan peppercorns on top and seal. Bury the bottle in the ground, secure with *chìshízhī* (red halloysite), and seal all around with toilet paper and clay. Weigh down with a heavy object and refine with five *jīn* of charcoal fire.",
      "overlap_context": "too cool. Nurture thus for three days until firm, then apply strong fire. Once cooled, remove the ball and shake it; if it rattles, the substance is complete.\n\n**Sun the Perfected’s Scripture’s Herb Method for Subduing Mercury**\nLotus leaves and *lutí*. First soak sulfur in water overnight, then remove and dry in the shade. Grind to powder, mix with mercury in a pan, and stir-fry to form sand. Wrap in paper and bury in the earth for one *liang* period. When unearthed, it has already become sand.",

      "translated_text": "**Another Method**\nGrind three *qián* of *mǔ* (cinnabar) into powder, combine with seven *qián* of mercury to form cinnabar sand. Wrap in black paper and boil in Sichuan pepper decoction for three *shí* (six hours). Allow to cool, then bind tightly with raw honey. Use Sichuan pepper, *huánghuā* (yellow flower), *dìdīng* (Chinese violet), or *cǎowūtóu* (wild aconite) as powder—three ingredients in total—and wrap around the outer layer. Alternatively, mix equal parts of *nánxīng* (jack-in-the-pulpit), *wǔbèizǐ* (gallnut), *báiyǒu* (white lime), *báiqiān* (white swallow-wort), *dìjǐn* (Japanese creeper), or *cǎowūtóu* with raw honey to a thickness of half a finger, then wrap around the previous package. Seal the ball with salt-clay and refine with three *jīn* of fire.\n\n**Method for Subduing Mercury Sand**\nPlace one *qián* of *mǔ* (cinnabar) and nine *qián* of mercury in a slow fire, using a small bowl. Sprinkle one *dàqián* (large coin’s worth) of powdered *gōngwūhuā* (unknown), *shéchuángzǐ* (cnidium seed), *chǔyè* (paper mulberry leaf), *wǔyèténg* (five-leaf vine), *lángdú* (wolfsbane), and *hànlián* (eclipta) onto the mercury. When smoke rises, stir with a bamboo stick until it turns the color of house dust, then remove the bowl. Discard the medicinal ash, pour the mercury onto paper, and let it congeal into hard cinnabar sand. If not fully formed, repeat the process. Once congealed, shape into a single piece, then grind *wǔbèizǐ* powder and *báiméi* (white plum) pulp into a paste in a mortar. Coat the cinnabar sand, wrap it in cotton (not too tightly), and bind with thread. Place in a *báihǔchí* (white tiger pool) bowl and stir-fry until the cotton turns scorched yellow. Remove and apply *guòguān* (passing-barrier) medicine: *tiānnánxīng* (jack-in-the-pulpit), *bànxià* (pinellia), *wǔwèizǐ* (schisandra), *báifùzǐ* (white aconite), *shǔkuíhuā* (hollyhock flower), and *wǔbèizǐ* as the outer barrier. Alternatively, mix *shǔkuíhuā* and *wǔbèizǐ* with honey, coat the exterior, wrap in toilet-clay, dry thoroughly, and refine with three *jīn* of fire until red.\n\n**Method for Coating Mercury**\nPlace one *liǎng* of mercury in an oil-free pan, then lightly sprinkle *sānhuáng* (three yellows) powder over it. Use a chicken feather to evenly spread the *sānhuáng* powder across the mercury’s surface. Cover with a small dish, then seal the rim with a strip of damp paper to prevent air leakage. Place the pan in warm-and-cool ash fire. From *yín* (3–5 AM) to *mǎo* (5–7 AM), add warm-and-cool fire beneath the pan, keeping the ash fire at half-height. From *mǎo* to *chén* (7–9 AM), then *chén* to *sì* (9–11 AM), apply three *jīn* of strong fire to refine until glowing red. After a short while, remove and inspect: the dried mercury should resemble white alum, with golden flecks on the surface. Reheat in the furnace to remove blackness, then melt into an ingot. The resulting *nǚshí* (female stone) will be lustrous white when immersed in water. For larger batches, adjust the fire accordingly, following the same method. The above is transmitted by Master Liú Qì.\n\n**Method for Congealing Mercury Sand into a Casket**\nGrind five *liǎng* of mercury and half a *liǎng* of high-quality *báinǚshí* (white female stone) *xiàshuǐ* (water) into powder. Use a thick white bowl and a cast-iron pan. Place the mercury and *báinǚshí xiàshuǐ* in the pan, heat with warm-and-cool fire until the *xiàshuǐ* melts, then line the bowl with a piece of fine, well-scoured white silk. Pour the mixture into the bowl, and with your hands, gather the congealed portion. Wrap it in paper and hold it near the body to absorb warmth. Cover the residue with white alum, then nurture with a gentle fire for two seven-day periods. Use only three *liǎng* of charcoal fire daily for the first seven days, increasing to four *liǎng* thereafter—do not exceed this amount. After the second seven-day period, increase to five *liǎng* for the next four to five days. Once cooled, remove and refine in a crucible as usual. During the two seven-day nurturing periods, maintain a soft fire. This method is so secret that even father and son do not transmit it; if carelessly shared, ten generations will be left without hands or feet. Keep this formula on your person, and at the time of death, secretly entrust it to a close relative. After passing, have the cinnabar casket cast into a long-flowing river—do not let it fall into the wrong hands. Perform this process no more than twice a month; do not overdo it. Beware, beware.\n\n**Master Gé’s *Purple Empyrean Elixir Canon* Method**\n**Method for Subduing Fire with Sulfur**\nObtain one *jīn* of sulfur from a foreign ship or monk’s robe. Grind it to powder and spread evenly in a flat-bottomed pan. Use rain-soaked mulberry branch ash lye—clarified and strong—for best results. Pour three *dǒu* of the lye over the sulfur to a depth of two fingers, then boil for one *fúshí* (twelve hours), stirring frequently to ensure evenness. Test a small amount over fire: if it subdues without igniting, it is ready; if not, add more lye and continue boiling until subdued. The sulfur should turn black as lacquer. Melt in a crucible with three to five *jīn* of charcoal fire, then pour into molds to form ingots. Later, crush, wash, dry, and grind into powder. Refine and cast into vessels, or use for medicinal purposes.\n\n**Master Sūn’s *Elixir Canon* Method for Subduing Sulfur**\nGrind one *liǎng* of sulfur, one *liǎng* of saltpeter, and half a *liǎng* of *lúshā* (sal ammoniac) into powder. Melt in a crucible, then pour into a mold to subdue.\n\n**Huáng Sānguān’s Method for Subduing Sulfur**\nTake four *liǎng* each of sulfur, *tānshí* (alumstone), and white alum. Mix half a bowl of fresh ginger juice with half a bowl of whetstone water, then soak five *dìng* of *zàojiǎo* (Chinese honey locust) to extract half a bowl of juice. Dissolve the three ingredients in this liquid until it reaches a thin consistency. Heat in an iron vessel over fire until dry, then scrape the powder into a casket and nurture for three seven-day periods.\n\n**Method for Subduing Fire with Sulfur**\nGrind two *liǎng* each of sulfur and saltpeter. Place the ingredients in a silver-melting pot or clay jar, then dig a pit in the ground and set the vessel inside, level with the surface. Pack soil tightly around it. Burn three undamaged *zàojiǎo* seeds until charred, then drop them in one by one. When the flames subside, place three *jīn* of raw and cooked charcoal around the mouth and refine.",

      "translated_text": "When one-third of the charcoal has burned away, remove the remaining fire and do not allow it to cool before retrieval—thus is the fire subdued.\n\n**Master Ge’s Alchemical Canon: Method for Subduing Realgar**\nOn the seventh day of the seventh lunar month, gather mulberry leaves in any quantity and dry them in the shade. For every *liǎng* of powdered mulberry leaves, add one *liǎng* of realgar. Place them in a ceramic vessel, layering mulberry leaves on top and bottom with realgar in the center, then seal tightly. Refine with ten *jīn* of honey and charcoal fire until stabilized. To convert it into powder, proceed in the same manner. For medicinal use, melt one *liǎng* of yellow wax with seven *gāngzǐ* (croton seeds), grind into a ball, and coat with one *liǎng* of mercury. Secure it to the navel with an adhesive; itching will occur within a day or two. After six years, the mercury hardens and becomes unusable.\n\n**Great Void Alchemical Canon: Method for Subduing Realgar**\nGrind realgar into fine powder. Mix with refined honey to the consistency of edible maltose, wrap tightly in several layers of coarse paper, and bind securely with silk thread. Boil a pot of water until rolling, then suspend the packet inside without touching the bottom. Continuously add boiling water to prevent cooling; use approximately one *yán* of water. Remove and grind in an iron mortar until extremely fine. Form into millet-sized pills with glutinous rice porridge water, and take one pill on an empty stomach with warm wine.\n\n**Master Ge’s Alchemical Canon: Method for Subduing Orpiment**\nUse orpiment in any quantity, layering subdued sal ammoniac on the bottom and top. Add borax the size of a *zàojiǎo* seed; for every *liǎng* of lead, it will be complete.\n\n**Master Sun’s Alchemical Canon: Method for Subduing Fire in Orpiment**\nTake half a *liǎng* of leaf orpiment and two *liǎng* of sal ammoniac, grind into fine powder. Mix evenly with egg white, fill into an eggshell, and seal the opening with paper. Then, grind one *liǎng* of white alum into powder, mix with egg white, and coat the shell; dry over fire. Next, grind one *liǎng* of saltpeter into fine powder, mix with egg white, and coat the shell; dry again. Finally, place one *jīn* of red lead in a vessel, set the orpiment and sal ammoniac inside, cover with red lead to form a casket, and seal with salt-clay. Dry, then refine with half a *chèng* of charcoal fire. Remove when complete. To use, melt cinnabar and mercury into a liquid, add one pill of the medicine, and form into water-chestnut-sized pills with yellow wax.\n\n**Methods for Subduing the Eight Minerals**\n\n**Master Ge’s Alchemical Canon: Method for Subduing Chalcanthite**\nTake one *liǎng* of chalcanthite and four *liǎng* of subdued sal ammoniac. Place in a sealed vessel and refine with three *jīn* of charcoal fire until red-hot. Use charcoal to form a pit, place the chalcanthite in the center, cover with sal ammoniac, and encase in a salt casket. Alternatively, nurture for one day before refining with three *jīn* of fire.\n\n**Master Sun’s Alchemical Canon: Method for Subduing Chalcanthite**\nGrind equal parts chalcanthite and green alum into powder, then refine with intense fire until molten.\n\n**Method for Dead Chalcanthite**\nExtract juice from hibiscus leaves and boil dry in a bowl with fresh ginger juice. Use a pot previously fumigated with a piece of frankincense, wrap the chalcanthite in paper, place it inside, and refine until molten. Pour onto a hot iron plate; the chalcanthite is thus rendered inert.\n\n**Method for Subduing Arsenic**\nGrind saltpeter and white alum into fine powder, layering them on the bottom and top. Place arsenic in the center within a crucible, seal with *báihǔfěng* (white tiger powder), and refine until red-hot. Remove and cast into ingots.\n\n**Method for Dead Arsenic**\nTake three *liǎng* of arsenic, six *qián* of cinnabar, six *qián* of *fěnshuāng* (calomel), and any quantity of saltpeter and alum to fill a vessel. Use a ceramic container, first lining the bottom with half a layer of saltpeter, then placing three *liǎng* of arsenic inside. Cover with half the remaining medicine, then layer alum, and finally fill the vessel with saltpeter. Seal with salt-clay, bind with hemp fibers, and seal again with salt-clay. Once dry, place in a casket and refine daily with one *jīn* of fire for three days. When removed, it will appear frosty white—thus is the arsenic rendered inert.\n\n**Method for Subduing Arsenolite (Tai Shang’s White Ying Elixir)**\nGrind half a *liǎng* of saltpeter and one *liǎng* of arsenolite into fine powder. Place in an oiled ceramic jar and stir-fry, adding two *liǎng* of white ash powder. Refine with four *jīn* of charcoal fire until the ash cools. Remove; it will be as white as snow. For every three *qián* of this powder, add two *qián* of white wax, mix with water, and form into millet-sized pills. Take one pill with freshly drawn water to treat malaria and dysentery.\n\n**Great Void Alchemical Canon: Method for Subduing Sulfur**\nGrind two *liǎng* of sulfur, two *liǎng* of saltpeter, and three *qián* of sal ammoniac into fine powder. Place in a large ingot pot and sprinkle with *fēnghuà báihǔ* (weathered white tiger powder) to fill the vessel without pressing down. Mix oyster shell powder with vinegar and coat the pot to a thickness of two fingers. Place the pot on the ground, arrange charcoal around it at a distance of four fingers, stacking it one *chǐ* high. Ignite three *jīn* of fire from the top, reducing to two *jīn* as it burns. When cool, retrieve the arsenolite from the center, which will resemble jade. Soak in fine water, then form into millet-sized pills with steamed cake. Take one pill on an empty stomach with cold water. It may be incorporated into various medicines and is particularly effective for treating deep-seated cold and hernia in men and women. For transmutation, its effects are extraordinary.\n\n**Method for Subduing Jade-like Arsenolite**\nTrue *shínǎoyóu* (naphtha) will spread upon contact with hair, curl upon touching the tongue, and not stain clothing. Grind four *liǎng* of jade-colored arsenolite into fine powder, mix with one *liǎng* of naphtha and one *liǎng* of fresh ginger juice, and blend evenly with the arsenolite powder to form a stiff dough. Place in a small ceramic vessel, first coating the interior with ginger juice. Do not cover; instead, expose the opening and apply gentle heat from all sides to eliminate yin qi. Once dry, remove and grind again.",

Burn the residue to ash, leach with water, and evaporate to frost. Scrape into a lidded vessel, seal tightly, and calcine with fire to subdue it. During boiling, add five *liǎng* of powdered *wǔyècǎo* (a herb with long, angular leaves resembling water caltrop, its stems bearing purple markings; abundant in western Sichuan). If unavailable, use pomegranate leaves alone, boiled in wood-ash lye within a ceramic vessel. After two subduing cycles, dry it, scrape into a lidded vessel, seal tightly, and dry thoroughly to expel all yin *qi*. Calcine with seven *jīn* of fire, then remove when cool.\n\n**Method for Subduing Sal Ammoniac:**\nLine the bottom and cover the top with saltpeter, seal with mud, and burn to subdue the fire. After boiling the sal ammoniac in ash lye, nourish it with *chǔ* leaves and silkworm droppings over fire, then dissolve in hot water, leach, and calcine until red—this yields an even finer result.\n\n**Method for Subduing Fire in Sal Ammoniac:**\nTake one *liǎng* of sal ammoniac, and half a *liǎng* each of oyster shell, cuttlebone, and clamshell (if any ingredient is lacking, substitute with subdued alum). Grind all into fine powder, heat a crucible until glowing red, and gradually add the mixture. Once subdued to ash, remove, grind again, and leach the liquid into a ceramic vessel. When nearly dry, transfer to a crucible, heat until molten, and it will resemble snow.\n\n**Method for Subduing Fire in Sal Ammoniac:**\nTake one *liǎng* of sal ammoniac and one *liǎng* of cuttlebone, grind together, and heat a crucible until red-hot. Melt the mixture into a liquid, remove, and cool. Grind finely, steep in boiling water, leach the liquid, and evaporate to frost. Re-calcine. Use powdered *chǔ* seeds and late silkworm droppings: first line half the powder in a crucible, tamp firmly, then place two layers of black paper. Add the sal ammoniac, cover with two more layers of black paper, and top with the remaining powder, tamped firmly. Do not seal tightly. Calcine with four *jīn* of fire until exhausted, then remove when cool—the fire will be subdued.\n\n**Method for Subduing Alum from the Alchemical Classic of Immortal Ge:**\nTake one *liǎng* of fine white alum, crush into pieces the size of soap beans. Use five *liǎng* of *dìjǐncǎo* (if unavailable, substitute with selfheal). Mix with yellow clay, paper fiber, and mud to a proper consistency. Seal a well-oiled ceramic vessel capable of holding the mixture with this mud, about half a *cùn* thick. When dry, place a half-brick on the ground, further sealing the base and sides. Gradually heat with charcoal until the mixture melts into a liquid, stir evenly with a willow branch, and continue for the time it takes to brew one or two cups of tea. Then gradually withdraw the fire and allow to cool. Break the vessel to retrieve the powder. Line the top and bottom with two *liǎng* of tung seeds, evenly distributed, with cinnabar in between, filling the vessel completely. Seal the seams with red halloysite and mud, securing with two iron rods in a cross. Use three *liǎng* of talc, two *liǎng* of charcoal, a small amount of white clay, and saltwater-soaked paper mud to seal the lidded vessel. Dry in a pit, then nourish with half a *jīn* of fire for twenty-one days. Later, add another half *jīn* of fire and nourish for forty-nine days. Once the cycle is complete, grind into powder and form into mung-bean-sized pills with glutinous rice porridge. One pill will transmute one *liǎng* of mercury into treasure.\n\n**Method for Refining Bronze:**\nTake equal parts of powdered chalcanthite, melanterite, and green vitriol. Beat refined copper into thin sheets, mix the powdered ingredients with vinegar to a paste-like consistency, and apply to the copper. Seal with powdered red halloysite mixed with cow dung, dry in the shade, and heat with gentle and strong fire for three cycles. Then place in a crucible, melt into a liquid, and it will become a precious metal of fine quality.\n\n**Method for the Longevity Vault:**\nTake a porcelain vessel from Dingzhou and seal it with Six-One Mud. Use one *liǎng* each of raw mercury and cinnabar, and one *liǎng* of raw silver powder. First place the mercury, then layer the cinnabar to press the mercury, alternating with silver powder until all is used. Seal tightly, then place in a small furnace. Arrange charcoal of sorghum-stalk length around the vessel, one *liǎng* of fire on each of the four sides, forming four pillars of charcoal. Nourish for seven days and nights. When the time is complete, calcine with one *jīn* of fire. Remove the contents, place back into the vessel, and add two *liǎng* of raw mercury. Repeat the charcoal arrangement and nourish for seven days. Add another two *liǎng* of mercury as before, nourish for seven days, then retrieve and refine into treasure. Add two *liǎng* of mercury again, completing the seven-day fire cycle.

      "translated_text": "**Sunflower Master’s Method for Transmuting Metal into Gold**\nTake one *jīn* of hundred-times-refined red copper and one *jīn* of Taiyuan furnace *gānshr̀i* (calamine). Grind one *liǎng* of the stone to a fine powder, sift with water, and mix evenly. Place in an iron vessel, seal tightly, and dry in the shade. Use eight *jīn* of charcoal in a wind furnace, beginning at the *chén* hour (7–9 a.m.), and fire continuously for two days and nights. Allow to cool, then transfer to a *qì* furnace for calcination, vigorously fanning for three hours before removal. Open the vessel, wash away the mud and water, and the resulting granules will resemble the color of a rooster’s comb. One *qián* of this mother-tincture transmutes one *liǎng* of base gold into superior gold.\n\nAlternatively, take one *liǎng* each of gold and mercury, combine to form cinnabar sand, then layer with *qīngyán* (halite) and *zhōnghuáng* (yellow earth from stone) as base and cover, sealing in a *dǎnfán* (chalcanthite) vessel. Employ the water-and-fire-balanced crucible, begin firing at the *chén* hour, and after three days and nights, the process yields wondrous results.\n\n**The Poor Woman’s Method for Transmuting Metal into Gold**\nGrind one *liǎng* of mercury with fifty sheets of gold leaf into a paste. Extract one large cup of juice from *gōngwūwěi* (a plant, likely *Polygonatum* or *Dioscorea*) by pressing, then boil the mercury in an oil-free pan until the juice evaporates. Wring the mercury through silk fabric to form cinnabar sand. Repeat the boiling and wringing until all mercury is converted to sand.\n\nMix four *liǎng* of *huángdān* (lead oxide) with *báihǔ* (white tiger, likely a mineral) powder, moistened with vinegar, and pound evenly in a mortar. Wrap the cinnabar sand in three to five layers of black paper, encase it in the *báihǔ* mixture, and shape into cakes. Seal the exterior with salt-clay to a thickness of one *cùn*, then dry in the shade. Calcine until glowing red, allow to cool, and use for transmutation as desired. If gold leaf is unavailable, half a *qián* of \"horse’s son\" (a substitute) works equally well. This method should be kept secret.\n\n**The Four-Spirit Metal-Enveloping Method**\nOne *liǎng* of raw silver, half a *liǎng* of gold,\nEqual weights of *jiěyán* (halite) and *qīngdǎn* (blue vitriol),\nAdd half a *liǎng* of *quèshā* (realgar) and sulfur,\nEnvelop to form a single piece of purple gold treasure.\n\n*Chà Nǚ Jīn* (Marvelous Woman’s Gold) is produced by enveloping with *jiěyán*, *dǎnfán*, *quèshā*, sulfur, and *gāncǎo* (licorice).\n\n**Method for Enveloping Cinnabar to Produce Gold**\nTake five *liǎng* of high-quality, granular cinnabar. Wrap each piece in five layers of gold leaf and embed in the medicinal mixture. Envelop for one *fú* (a period of time, likely a day) with half a *jīn* of fire, gradually increasing to three *jīn*. Calcine until glowing red, then allow to cool. The resulting substance will not diminish and may be used freely.\n\n**Method from the *Tai Xu Dan Jing* for Enveloping Gold in the Azure Oil Pool**\nTake seven *qián* of *lǜfán* (green vitriol), four *liǎng* of *báifán* (white alum), and one and a half *liǎng* of *qīngyuán* (azure salt). Flatten one *liǎng* of base gold into sheets. In a new porcelain vessel, first sprinkle one *liǎng* of the medicinal mixture, place the gold sheets inside, then cover with another *liǎng* of the mixture. Seal tightly and calcine for one hour. Remove and soak in a solution to deepen the color.\n\n**Method for Enveloping Gold**\nTake one and a half *liǎng* of *jiěyán*, one *liǎng* and three *qián* of *dǎnfán*, four *qián* of *báifán*, seven and a half *qián* of *qīngyán*, two and a half *qián* of *yànhāo* (saltpeter), and half a *qián* of *shínǎoyóu* (naphtha). Grind these six ingredients into a fine powder. If *shínǎoyóu* is unavailable, substitute two *qián* of calcined *shā* (cinnabar) for the inner envelope.\n\nAdditionally, grind four *liǎng* of *xuánkuì* (likely a mineral or plant ash) with one *liǎng* of *jiěyán* into a fine powder. For enveloping, use a separate porcelain dish. First, layer the dish three to five times with the *xuánkuì* mixture, forming a nest. Then, add the inner-envelope medicine three to five times within the nest. Place the gold inside, cover with the inner-envelope medicine, and seal with a tile. Secure with an iron wire in a cross pattern, then seal with salt-clay to a thickness of one finger. Allow to dry, place on level ground, and surround with ash. For ten *liǎng* of gold, use twenty *jīn* of fire; for five to seven *liǎng*, use one *chèng* (a unit of weight) of fire; for three to five *liǎng*, use ten *jīn* of fire; and for one to two *liǎng*, use five *jīn* of fire. Once the fire has consumed all fuel, allow to cool, then remove. If the color has transformed into purple gold, place back into the pot to eliminate any residual smoke. No harm will come to the gold.\n\n**Effortless and Marvelous Method for Enveloping Gold**\nFor each *liǎng* of gold, take half a *liǎng* of *báishízhī* (white halloysite), half a *liǎng* of white clay, one and a half *qián* of *báifán*, four *qián* of salt, three *qián* of *dàizhěshí* (hematite), half a *liǎng* of *huángfán* (yellow vitriol), and half a *qián* of calcined *shā*. Use the whitest white clay available.\n\nGrind the ingredients into a fine powder and place in a small porcelain jar. Sprinkle one *qián* of *dàizhěshí* powder at the bottom, then add half of the remaining medicine. Place the gold inside, cover with the other half of the medicine, and seal the jar’s mouth with a tile. Use three to five *jīn* of charcoal fire; the duration of firing is flexible, though in winter, half a day suffices. For larger quantities of gold, use a deeper porcelain jar. If using old hairpins or bracelets, first fire them once or twice to remove impurities and grease before applying the medicine. Only one firing is needed; retain the residual medicine from the fire for use as a cover in subsequent firings.\n\n**Fire-Taming Cinnabar and Spring-Chanting Method**\nTake one and a half *liǎng* of silver and three *liǎng* of high-quality cinnabar, cut into dice-sized pieces. First, coat the cinnabar with honey, then boil with half a *liǎng* of calcined *shā* in water for three *fú*. Grind the cinnabar finely, leaving the dice-sized pieces unground. Add a small amount of mercury and mix with *qínfán* (alum), then combine with the cinnabar pieces.\n\nPrepare silver powder by grinding one sheet of heavy paper with one *qián* of ink, then mixing with honey. Spread the mixture evenly on the paper and allow to dry. Wrap the cinnabar pieces in the paper, securing with thread. Mix yellow clay with oil to form a paste, then wrap the paper-wrapped cinnabar in a ball of uniform thickness, approximately one finger’s width, ensuring no cracks. Place on a gentle fire to expel all moisture, then transfer to an oiled porcelain vessel. Layer with one *jīn* of *qīngyuán*, using half to line the bottom and half to cover the top. Seal tightly and place in a pit lined with ash. Typically, use half a *jīn* of fire, maintaining it continuously for seven days. Then, add two *jīn* of fire and nourish for one more night.",
      "overlap_context": "lace back into the vessel, and add two *liǎng* of raw mercury. Repeat the charcoal arrangement and nourish for seven days. Add another two *liǎng* of mercury as before, nourish for seven days, then retrieve and refine into treasure. Add two *liǎng* of mercury again, completing the seven-day fire cycle. By repeatedly adding two *liǎng* of mercury, the process becomes everlasting.\n\n*End of Scroll Five of Various Schools’ Divine Elixir Methods*\n*Scroll Six of Various Schools’ Divine Elixir Methods*",

      "translated_text": "Remove the fire and open the vessel to collect the salt flowers. Break open the ball and retrieve the cinnabar, which will resemble black tin. Place it again in a crucible, melt into liquid, and pour into an ingot mold, yielding a total of four and a half *liǎng*. Grind into powder with iron filings.\n\nTake six *liǎng* of raw cinnabar, the size of dice, and grind evenly with the fire-tamed cinnabar. Then place in the vessel, lining the bottom and covering the top with salt flowers. Seal tightly and set in the ash pit, continuously nourishing with four *liǎng* of fire for a full seven days. Add two *jīn* of fire and nourish for one more night. Remove the fire, allow to cool, and retrieve the product as high-grade silver.\n\nSet aside one and a half *liǎng* for use, then take another one and a half *liǎng* of raw silver and mix with two *liǎng* of cinnabar. Grind the silver filings and cinnabar together evenly, then place in the vessel as before. Seal and nourish for seven days, adding two *jīn* of fire. Fire for one more night, then retrieve.\n\nAgain, set aside one and a half *liǎng* for use, retaining one and a half *liǎng* as the base to continuously replenish with cinnabar for further firing. If no continuous replenishment is desired, up to twenty *liǎng* may be made. Cast into a tripod vessel the size of a chicken egg. Place the tripod in a bed of well-charred ash fire, then add two *liǎng* of mercury into the tripod. Cover the opening with three layers of damp paper, then seal with an inverted porcelain bowl. Gradually increase the fire and heat for one *shí* (two hours), whereupon the mercury will transform into silver. Then, following the previous method, nourish with two *jīn* of fire continuously for one *fúshí* (twelve hours). Allow to cool, retrieve, and shape as desired.\n\nThereafter, maintain two *liǎng* of mercury in the tripod to continuously produce silver—hence the name \"Gushing Spring Method.\" The newly prepared cinnabar must first be treated: take half a *liǎng* of roasted cinnabar, dissolve in water and boil, then mix a small amount with alum and stir thoroughly before use. Such meticulous preparation is the key to its efficacy.\n\n**Method for Harmonizing Silver with the Mother (Alloying Process)**\nMother (base metal): five *qián*; mercury: six *qián*. Clean with hot pepper water, then boil in one *shēng* of rice vinegar with half a *liǎng* of white alum, three *qián* each of Sichuan pepper and lotus leaves, and two *qián* of *Aconitum* (monkshood). Suspend and boil until the vinegar is fully evaporated. The cinnabar will harden like iron. Remove, wrap in three layers of black paper, and press against the body to tame.\n\nGrind equal parts of borax, chalcanthite, roasted alum, and salt-fried *qīngyuán* into powder. First, mix three *qián* of clear honey with half a *liǎng* of the powder and apply to the body. Then wrap in two layers of *Kunlun* paper, cutting the paper into six-petal flower shapes and pasting them securely. Next, mix five倍子 powder with vinegar and wrap one or two more layers. Use one *liǎng* of the powder to coat the exterior until fully covered, then wrap again with *Kunlun* paper as before.\n\nGrind one *qián* each of *Anemarrhena*, *Fritillaria*, *Angelica dahurica*, *Epimedium*, *Glechoma*, *Aconitum*, and *Dioscorea bulbifera* into powder, mix with vinegar, and wrap. Then wrap once more with *Kunlun* paper. Mix half a *liǎng* of salt with two *liǎng* of white ants and one *qiān* of *Qianliji* (a medicinal herb), grind into a paste, and seal the exterior. Place in ash fire to bake, applying three to four *liǎng* of fire while frequently turning. When dry, retrieve and patch any cracks. Return to the ash fire and bake for one to two *shíchén* (two to four hours), then evenly surround with five *jīn* of mature fire and heat to completion.\n\nRetrieve while still attached to the body. Do not remove from the furnace; first prepare a fire scale of six *jīn* and construct a brick furnace. Ignite the fire and heat the furnace thoroughly.\n\n**Golden Elixir Method**\nOne *jīn* of refined sulfur, translucent and ground to fine powder.\nTwo *liǎng* of *shanchishi* (mountain saltpeter), finely ground.\nThree *liǎng* of fire-tamed *beiting* (a type of salt) solution.\n\nCombine these three ingredients evenly. Take an iron vessel, grind high-quality ink with rice vinegar, and thickly coat the interior three times. Allow to dry, then place the three ingredients inside. Apply gentle and strong fire alternately to heat until the medicine melts into liquid, expelling all *beiting* yin-qi. Cease firing and allow to cool.\n\nAdd four *liǎng* of saltpeter, finely ground to powder, filling the vessel completely and pressing firmly. Seal the vessel’s opening with dry paper. Once dry, place in a tripod and seal with *fa-ni* (method clay). The *fa-ni* is made from *yangmen daizheshi* (hematite resembling a rooster’s comb), left-coiling oyster shell, and *chishizhi* (red halloysite), ground to fine powder in equal parts. Mix with *beiting* solution, knead in a mortar for over a thousand strokes, then use to seal the vessel and its base thoroughly, ensuring tightness.\n\nSecure the tripod’s lid with an iron lock, ensuring it is tightly sealed. Allow to dry, then take three *jīn* of lead and melt in a crucible. Use a small iron ladle to scoop the molten lead and evenly coat the vessel’s exterior. Gradually pour the lead liquid into the tripod until it reaches two *cùn* above the vessel’s opening.\n\nSelect an auspicious day and begin firing at midnight (the *zǐ* hour). Start with six *liǎng* of fire, increasing by one *liǎng* each day until the sixth day. When the tripod has cooled completely, use a small iron chisel to remove the blackened exterior, open the vessel, and retrieve the medicine—now the color of true gold. Grind finely in a mortar for use.\n\n**Method for Refining Silver Powder**\nTen *liǎng* of high-quality silver and fifty *liǎng* of mercury, stored in a jar and kept warm over a constant fire. Heat the silver until red-hot, then immerse in the mercury, stirring with a willow spatula until fully dissolved.\n\nGrind three *jīn* of salt with the silver amalgam until fine, then place evenly in a large pot. Cover with a basin, sealing the edges tightly with clay. Heat gently to vaporize the mercury, continuing until the mercury is fully expelled. Dry the silver powder in the sun, then grind to a fine powder.\n\nEight *liǎng* of realgar, translucent and leaf-like, ground to powder.\nFour *liǎng* of halite, ground.\nTen *liǎng* of gold powder.\nEight *liǎng* of orpiment, ground to powder and resembling a rooster’s comb for best quality.",

      "translated_text": "**Method for Subduing Fire with Northern Hall Sand**\n\nTake three *liǎng* of clear Northern Hall cinnabar and mix it evenly with one and a half *fēn* of melted yellow wax to form a ball, then wrap it in paper.\n\nTake one *dǒu* of slaked lime, place half in a porcelain jar, and pack it tightly. Scoop out a hollow in the center and place the Northern Hall cinnabar ball inside. Cover with the remaining lime and pack tightly as before.\n\nBegin with three *jīn* of fuel, gradually increasing to five or seven *jīn* over three *fú* periods, then use ten *jīn* of fire to calcine until red-hot. Once cooled, remove and place in a raw silk bag.\n\nDig a pit large enough to hold five to seven *shēng* of water, ensuring it is fully saturated. Place a fine porcelain bowl inside, lay a stick across it, and suspend the cinnabar bag above the bowl. Cover with a basin, seal the edges with damp earth to prevent air leakage, and leave for three *fú* periods until it liquefies. Mix this liquid with the aforementioned two ingredients.\n\n**Method for Subduing the Elixir and Transmuting Mercury into Metal (Gēng Method)**\n\nFor each *jīn* of mercury, use one *fēn* of the elixir. Place the elixir atop the mercury in a new iron crucible, cover with a tea bowl, and seal properly. Set over a fire and listen for the sound of dripping within. Plunge the crucible into water to quench, repeating this ten or more times until the mercury is subdued, appearing like black sand. Transfer to a crucible and melt—it will become polished purple gold. Its transformations are too numerous to record fully.\n\n**Divine Immortal’s Gold-Refining Elixir (Also Called Bone-Transforming Elixir)**\n\nTake five *liǎng* each of *fěnshuāng* and arsenic, refined nine times by sublimation. If sublimation is not possible, calcine with fire instead.\n\nGrind the two ingredients together until they can be formed into balls, then dry them. Add one *liǎng* each of Northern Hall cinnabar, saltpeter, white alum, *tàiyīn xuánjīng*, and *shíyán huā* (red alum for the alum stone).\n\nTake a sealed crucible and pack three to four *liǎng* of *yánhūa* tightly at the bottom. Place the *fěnshuāng*-arsenic ball inside, then layer the Northern Hall cinnabar and other ingredients, adding more *yánhūa* and packing tightly. If the crucible is not full, fill it with *yánhūa*. Seal properly, ensuring no cracks, and dry thoroughly before placing it in the furnace.\n\nLine the furnace bottom with one *jīn* of lead, set the crucible on top, and secure it with iron rods. Melt additional lead and pour it in until it submerges the crucible by three *cùn*. Bury in ash, cover, and maintain a gentle fire to keep the lead soft. After sixty days and nights, increase the fire above and below the furnace until it glows red-hot. After one day, allow it to cool, then reheat the furnace to melt the lead and remove the crucible. Break it open, discard the residue, and retrieve the two elixir ingredients—now a delightful chicken-yellow color. Grind finely and form into rice-sized pills with glutinous rice. Each pill can transmute one *liǎng* of mercury into treasure. For consumption, take one pill on an empty stomach with tea or wine to replenish *qi*, warm the kidneys, and yield divine effects too profound to describe.\n\n**Method for Subduing Fire with Divine Brocade Cinnabar**\n\nTake sixty-four *liǎng* of *shānzé* (mountain marsh ore), hammer into thin sheets, and cut into chess-piece shapes.\n\nTake one *jīn* of granular cinnabar, refine it using the *xuántāi* method, and dry. Roll the cinnabar in *bǎihuā ruǐ* (hundred-flower pollen), coat with the body-binding elixir, wrap each piece in silk, and dry in sunlight.\n\nStore in a porcelain container and nurture with fire for one month, gradually increasing the heat. Then place the refined divine cinnabar in a water-fire crucible, pour in two *liǎng* of *yīn*-refined mercury, seal, and fire for two days and nights until the process is complete. Allow to cool, then open as in the subduing-fire method. Add another two *liǎng* of mercury and repeat the firing if necessary, up to a total of three *jīn* of mercury. Melt in a crucible to form treasure.\n\n**Xuántāi (Suspended Womb) Method**\n\nPlace the divine cinnabar in a cloth bag. In a new sand pot, add ten bottles of vinegar and one and a half *liǎng* of white sulfur. Suspend the bag above the pot with an iron rod, ensuring it does not touch the bottom. Heat gently until the vinegar evaporates, then dry. Coat the cinnabar with refined *bǎihuā* elixir, then dust with a fine powder of *xī péngshā* (western borax), *qiān bái shuāng* (lead white frost), and white alum. Wrap in silk, dry in sunlight, and store in a sealed container.\n\n**Sealed Container Method**\n\nHammer *shānzé* into silver sheets and cut into small chess-piece shapes. Mix half with vinegar and tamp into a porcelain container. Arrange the cinnabar as if planting lotus seeds, ensuring no contact. Cover with the remaining silver sheets, then seal the seams with a mixture of *hánshuǐshí* (cold-water stone) and white alum. Secure with iron wire in a cross pattern, then seal with *guànní* (washbasin mud).\n\nDry, then place in a furnace ash pit. Use a clay pot large enough to hold one *dǒu* and five *shēng*. Place a three-legged stand inside, set the container on top, and sift ten thousand coins’ worth of ash to fill one *dǒu* and two *shēng*, leaving two *liǎng* at the top. Begin with gentle fire at the *mǎo* hour, add another round at the *shēn* hour, and regulate the heat evenly without interruption. Nurture for one month until the cinnabar hardens, then transfer to a water-fire crucible.\n\n**Water-Fire Crucible Method**\n\nUse an iron crucible six to seven *cùn* tall. Place the cinnabar inside, pour two *liǎng* of *hài*-refined mercury over it, and cover with an iron lid secured tightly with iron wire. Seal properly, then add warm water to the lid. Apply fire as follows:\n\n**Fire Regulation Method**\n\nBegin gently and gradually increase the heat, firing for two days and nights until complete. Allow to cool, then open the crucible as in the subduing-fire method.",
      "overlap_context": "gin firing at midnight during the *zǐ* hour. Start with six *liǎng* of fuel, increasing by one *liǎng* each day until sixty days are complete. Once cooled, chip away the black lead to retrieve the crucible—the elixir within should appear as purple gold.\n\nGrind one *fēn* of this elixir finely in a mortar; it can transmute one *jīn* of mercury into polished purple gold. This is not of the mortal world but a secret transmission from the immortals. For those who seek the Dao, let this be sufficient.",

      "translated_text": "Once again pour two *liǎng* of mercury. If not yet fired, continue until three *jīn* of charcoal are consumed, at which point the mercury will be exhausted. Should one wish to form the substance, let the fumes disperse until it liquefies—mercury thus becomes the supreme treasure.\n\n**Divine Immortal’s Art for Saving the World**\nTake four *liǎng* of arsenic trioxide, the whitest being best. Add one *liǎng* of *fěnshuāng*, five *qián* of mother-of-mercury powder, and five *qián* of mercury. Grind the above ingredients together until no specks remain.\n\nPlace them in a porcelain crucible, seal with a one-*cùn* layer of salt-clay, and let dry in the shade. Coat the interior of the crucible with raw mercury, then add the prepared medicine. Take half a *liǎng* of sublimed alum and one *liǎng* of *hánshuǐshí*, grind finely, mix with vinegar, and seal the crucible’s seams. Apply another layer of salt-clay. Once dry, place the crucible in the furnace.\n\nFirst surround it with three to five *jīn* of matured charcoal. Begin firing at the *yín* hour, gradually increasing the heat until the *mǎo* hour, using one and a half *chèng* of charcoal. Cease firing and allow to cool. Open the crucible and remove the medicine, then nurture it with the following *kuì* method.\n\n**Kuì-Nurturing Method**\nTake a white porcelain container, ensuring it has not been exposed to water. First use effloresced powder, then cold powder, to form a depression. Place the medicine inside. Layer above it first alum powder, then cold powder, then effloresced powder, filling the container completely. Press firmly, cover with the original lid, and seal the seams with the same clay. Secure further with iron wire, then apply a thorough coating of *guàn* clay. Once dry, place in an ash pit and nurture with fire for seven days. Remove when complete.\n\nOne *liǎng* of *zhènmáo* can transmute one *qián* of medicine. Refine the three powders—alum, *hánshuǐshí*, and effloresced—by firing them again to ash.\n\n**Bá-Máo Method**\nCombine the ashes of mulberry, *yùnǚcǎo*, and *huīdíjī*, then leach to obtain the liquid. Add equal parts of *guālǒu*, *dǔyí*, and white *dīngxiāng* powder to the liquid. Place in a willow trough and press ten times—this yields a highly refined product, with one *jīn* producing ten *liǎng*.\n\n**Lead-Sand Method**\nTake one *liǎng* of divine sand and one *liǎng* of lead. First melt the lead into liquid, then add the divine sand powder to form sand. Proceed with the *yìn*-refining method.\n\n**Yìn-Refining Method**\nUse the ashes of *shèsōng*, duckweed, *jiàyìnǚ*, and mulberry leaves. Leach the above to obtain the liquid, repeating several times. Subject the prepared sand to *yìn*-refining for two days and nights. Wipe dry, then melt in a crucible. When melting, sprinkle equal parts of alum, saltpeter, and salt powder on top to form the liquid. Pour out to yield the treasure. Finally, place in the divine chamber—if not placed in the divine chamber, it remains unusable.\n\n**Separating the Embryo Method**\nUse soapberry powder, human hair, and saltpeter to skim and refine, producing a treasure of the highest grade. Alternatively, separation may be achieved using iron dross.\n\n**Four-Spirit Elixir Method**\nTake one *jīn* of divine sand, add four *liǎng* of realgar and two *liǎng* of sulfur. Grind to powder and refine for one day and night. Then place in a jar and fire again to form divine sand. Grind once more to fine powder, add four *liǎng* of orpiment, then refine for another day and night. Place in a jar and fire to form sand. Grind again, add four *liǎng* of cinnabar and one *liǎng* of sulfur powder, refine for one day and night, then place in a jar and fire to form sand. Grind finely—one *shī* can transmute ten thousand coins’ worth of *máo* into silver.\n\n**Three-Pair Adorning Jade Maiden’s Embryo-Entering Method**\nTake three *liǎng* each of silver and mercury. First melt the lead into liquid, then add the mercury and stir-fry until liquefied. Next, use the following ingredients: magnetite, Sichuan pepper, arsenolite, green salt, calcined alum, dried lotus root, and human hair—eight ingredients in equal parts. Grind to fine powder and add to the lead-mercury liquid repeatedly until the lead and mercury turn pure white. Then melt three *liǎng* of true silver into liquid, add the lead-mercury sand, and if smoke rises, add *xuánqīng* three to five times. Pour into an oil trough to yield a treasure of the highest grade.\n\n**Jade Maiden’s Embryo-Entering Method**\nTake three *liǎng* of true lead, hammer into thin sheets, and cut into pieces. Add three *liǎng* of mercury and one *shēng* of water, then boil. Use half a *liǎng* of alum and three *qián* of Sichuan pepper. Grind the above in a mortar until they form a clay-like paste, shaping into cherry-sized pills. Place in a cloth bag and boil in a bottle of good vinegar with alum and Sichuan pepper powder until the vinegar is exhausted. Remove the pills, soak the bag in cold water for one hour, then place in the *kuì*.\n\n**Kuì-Nurturing Method**\nTake four *liǎng* of sublimed arsenic trioxide, grind to fine powder, and place in a porcelain container, lining the bottom and covering the top. Place the pills inside. Seal the seams with red halloysite powder, ensuring even ventilation. Apply a one-finger-thick layer of salt-clay, dry over fire, then place in an ash pit and nurture with fire for seven days. When complete, test by biting—if no grass-like sound is heard, it is ready. If a grass-like sound remains, continue nurturing until it disappears. Remove all medicine, then melt two portions of sublimed arsenic trioxide into liquid. Toss the pills into the golden liquid and boil for the time it takes to cook a bowl of rice. Pour into an iron vessel, let cool, and remove the pills. Wash the pills thoroughly with warm water, then place in a clean pot and melt together. Pour into an oil trough to form the treasure. Each three *qián* can transmute seven *qián* of *máo* into silver.\n\n**Subliming Arsenic Trioxide Method**\nTake two *liǎng* of arsenic trioxide, four *liǎng* of saltpeter, five *qián* of alum, and five *qián* of *báihǔ*. Grind the four ingredients together to fine powder, place in a crucible, and seal the mouth with five to seven layers of damp paper, keeping the paper moist to prevent drying. Use five *jīn* of charcoal fire below, firing for half an hour until it liquefies. Pour into a vessel, let cool, and grind to fine powder—this serves as the lining and covering medicine for the previous process.\n\n**Condensing Mercury Method**\nTake four *liǎng* of alum oil and two *liǎng* of sublimed sulfur. First place two *liǎng* of alum oil in a pot, then add one *liǎng* of sulfur. Seal with salt-clay and fire the pot until it glows red throughout, naturally forming the *kuì*.",

Cover with a layer of vinegar-soaked paper, then apply a mixture of yellow earth and vinegar, half-dry and half-moist, to an even consistency. Seal the paper with salt-clay and place in the furnace.\n\nFirst, arrange four ox-head crucibles with their openings facing upward, level and stable. Invert one crucible, cutting a small hole in its base, and place it atop the others to serve as a stable platform. Surround the crucible with a trench, filling it tightly with straw ash.

When nearly dry, let it cool slightly, then remove onto paper and grind into powder for use as before.\n\n**Miscellaneous Methods**\n**Single-Body Method**\nTake one *liǎng* of fine silver powder and one *liǎng* of mercury, combine in a stone mortar, and pound three to five hundred times with the aforementioned medicine until it forms cinnabar sand. Filter through boiled silk, place in a stone pot, and mix with brine, white alum, and green salt, blending thoroughly with vinegar paste. Boil for three days and nights, then transfer to a salt crucible. Nurture with gentle and strong fire for one day, remove, and grind finely. Mix with one *liǎng* of *fěnshuāng*, return to the salt crucible, seal with brine-clay, and fire with horse-passing fire for seven days and nights without extinguishing the flame. Finally, refine with intense fire, let cool, and divide one *liǎng* of the medicine into three portions to transmute ten *liǎng* of base metal. Keep this secret.\n\n**Subduing Fire Borax Method**\nTake one *liǎng* of borax and one *liǎng* of *zhīmǔ*, grind to fine powder, and place a crucible over one *jīn* of charcoal fire. First, add half the *zhīmǔ* powder to the crucible and stir-fry until it turns to ash, then remove. Add the borax, and after a while, when it liquefies and boils over, press it down with the remaining *zhīmǔ* powder to naturally subdue the fire. Pour into a porcelain dish to form sticks. When refining silver sand in a crucible, grind the borax into powder, mix with fine rice vinegar, and apply evenly to the sand by hand. After removal from the crucible, scrape the borax from the sand for reuse.\n\n**Subduing Fire Saltpeter Method**\nGrind one *liǎng* of saltpeter and half a *liǎng* of arsenic together to fine powder. Line and cover the crucible with white tiger powder, seal the arsenic tightly, and externally reinforce it. Refine with three to five *jīn* of charcoal fire until red-hot. Then add half a *liǎng* of *shū*, increasing to four *liǎng*, to form a crucible for nurturing one *liǎng* of mother sand. Using sand refined with the two *qì* is especially effective.\n\n**Another Dead Arsenic Method**\nTake one *liǎng* each of arsenic and saltpeter, and two *liǎng* of white alum, grind to fine powder. First melt half the saltpeter and alum, then add the arsenic, and cover with the remaining half of saltpeter and alum until fully calcined. Then add three *liǎng* of *yángqǐshí*, two *liǎng* of *báishízhī*, and three *liǎng* of *hánshuǐshí*, and grind with the previous medicine into powder. Mix with water to form pills the size of soap beans, dry thoroughly, and place in a sand container. Ignite with charcoal fire until five-colored radiance appears—this is the Divine Immortal Defense.\n\n**Subduing Arsenic with the Jade Maiden’s Extraction**\nTake one *liǎng* of gold-footed arsenic, wrap the powder in two or three layers of silk, and bind it with a paste made from fresh ginger juice and white flour. Then take two *jīn* of *dìfūzǐ* powder, mix with vinegar to form lumps, and encase the medicine. Ignite with five *jīn* of charcoal fire from the *yín* hour to the *shēn* hour.\n\n**Gold Crucible Arsenic Subduing Method**\nTake one *liǎng* of *shū*, place in a porcelain jar, and melt three *liǎng* of tin over fire. Add arsenic in pieces the size of soap beans gradually until it floats to the surface. Remove and let cool, then take the arsenic and grind with an equal part of cinnabar. Place in a crucible, set in a wind furnace, and refine until it perishes—this can then be used.\n\n**Subduing Saltpeter Method**\nTake three *liǎng* of fine cinnabar, two *liǎng* of mulberry root bark, and one *liǎng* of *kǔshēn*, grind to fine powder. Place one *jīn* of saltpeter in a crucible, line and cover with the powdered medicine, add saltpeter in the center, and without sealing, fire until red-hot. The resulting golden liquid resembles jade and can be shaped into vessels.\n\nFor use, place any amount of saltpeter in a crucible and seal the mouth with bitter bamboo leaves.\n\n*Various Schools’ Divine Elixir Methods, Scroll Six—End*",
      "overlap_context": " prevent drying. Use five *jīn* of charcoal fire below, firing for half an hour until it liquefies. Pour into a vessel, let cool, and grind to fine powder—this serves as the lining and covering medicine for the previous process.\n\n**Condensing Mercury Method**\nTake four *liǎng* of alum oil and two *liǎng* of sublimed sulfur. First place two *liǎng* of alum oil in a pot, then add one *liǎng* of sulfur. Seal with salt-clay and fire the pot until it glows red throughout, naturally forming the *kuì*.",
