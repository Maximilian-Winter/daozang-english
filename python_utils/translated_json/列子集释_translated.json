  "full_translation": "*The Collected Annotations on the Liezi by Yang Bojun*\n*Volume One: \"Heavenly Portents\" (Chapter One)*\n\n[Annotation] Though vast and minute intermingle in disorder, though length of life and nature differ, even within the greatness of Heaven and Earth and the multitude of all beings—all that falls within the realm of living existence and enters the domain of activity and function—undergoes transformation between existence and decay as the natural tally of things. Only that which abides in absolute quiescence, ultimate emptiness, and undivided unity without change lies beyond the cycles of yin and yang or the revolutions of the four seasons.\n\n[Exegesis] Among all moving things, none fails to take life as its master. Yet they cherish life without understanding the principle of life begetting life. That which undergoes generation and transformation possesses form; that which begets life is without image. What has form is called \"thing\"; what is without image is called \"spirit.\" Its traces may be employed, akin to yin and yang. But when one discusses its true nature, it lies beyond the reckoning of yin and yang. Thus, the *Yijing* states: \"That which yin and yang cannot fathom is called *shen*.\" Is this not the great numinous portent at the heart of Heaven and Earth? Hence, it is called \"Heavenly Portents.\"\n\nThe *Explanations of the Text* note: *Fu* (夫) is pronounced *fú*, serving as the opening of a statement; this pronunciation is not repeated thereafter. *Chuǎn* (舛) is read as *chǎngyǎn*. *Fèn* (分) is read as *fúwèn*; the same applies below.\n\nLiezi—[Annotation:] Placing \"Zi\" before the surname indicates that the opening chapter may have been recorded by his disciples. *Shiwen* notes: Adding \"Zi\" to the surname signifies his status as a teacher.\n\nHe dwelt in the gardens of Zheng. [Annotation:] Zheng possessed the Pu Fields. *Shiwen* notes: *Pu* is pronounced *bǔ*. The Pu Fields were the marshes of Zheng, now located in Zhongmou County of Xingyang. Bo Jun observes: The Pu Fields of Zheng are also written as \"Fu Fields\" in the *Book of Songs*, *Zuozhuan*, and *Erya*. Today, the Zhangba Ditch and nearby lakes in southwest Zhongmou County, Henan, are their remnants.\n\nFor forty years, no one recognized him. [Annotation:] Without form, he did not engage with things; without speech, he did not interact with them. Those unaware of his utmost virtue were as if they did not know him at all. The character \"無\" (*wú*) here follows the *Shide Tang* edition and the *Four Explanations*; the same applies below. *Shiwen* notes: \"無\" is sometimes written as \"亡.\"\n\nThe lord of the state, ministers, and grandees regarded him as one of the common people. [Annotation:] He did not isolate himself from things; rather, his words were free of right and wrong, his conduct left no trace, so things could not comprehend him. *Xíng* (行) is pronounced *xià* in the lower tone. The state suffered insufficiency. [Annotation:] A year of famine. He was to \"marry out\" to Wei. [Annotation:] To leave one’s home is called *jià* (嫁). [Explanation:] \"Insufficiency\" refers to a year of famine. *Jià* means \"to go.\"\n\nHis disciples said: \"Master, you depart without a set time for return. Your disciples dare to make a request—[Explanation:] *Yè* (谒) means \"to request.\" *Shiwen* notes: *Yè* means \"to request.\"—what teachings will you leave us? Have you not heard the words of Master Huqiu Zilin?\" [Annotation:] Huqiu Zilin was Liezi’s teacher. *Shiwen* notes: Huqiu Zilin—*Sima Biao’s Commentary on the True Scripture of Southern Florescence* states his name was Lin, a native of Zheng.\n\nLiezi laughed and said: \"What words could Master Hu have? [Annotation:] The four seasons proceed, the myriad things are born—do these depend on words? As the *Lunyu* records Confucius saying: 'What does Heaven say? The four seasons proceed, the myriad things are born—what does Heaven say?' Yet the Master once spoke to Bohun Maoren. *Shiwen* notes: *Yǔ* (語) is also written as *zhào*; *zhào* means \"to inform.\" *Mào* (瞀) is pronounced *mòhóu*; later, \"Bohun Wu Ren\" is also read as *móu*. I overheard it and shall try to tell you. [Annotation:] Bohun was Liezi’s friend, a fellow student under Master Hu. Not saying he received instruction directly from Master Hu reflects Liezi’s humility. Lu Wenchang notes: In Zhang’s annotation, \"Liezi’s humility\" may have an erroneous \"者\" (*zhě*) instead of \"言\" (*yán*). *Shiwen* notes: *Nǚ* (女) is pronounced *rǔ*.\n\nHis words were: There is *sheng* (生, arising)—[Annotation:] The present clod-like form. *Shiwen* notes: *Kuài* (块) is pronounced *kòuduì*.—yet not *sheng* (生, self-arising). [Annotation:] That which gives life to things yet does not arise itself. There is *hua* (化, transformation)—[Annotation:] The present state of existence, decay, change, and alteration.—yet not *hua* (化, self-transformation). [Annotation:] That which transforms things yet does not transform itself. [Explanation:] Not arising from things, not being transformed by things, it thus gives life to all living beings and transforms all transformations.\n\nThat which does not arise can give life to life. [Annotation:] That which does not arise is fundamentally the origin of living things. That which does not transform can transform transformation. [Annotation:] That which does not transform is fundamentally the master of transforming things. That which arises cannot but arise; that which transforms cannot but transform. [Annotation:] That which arises does not arise by its own power; that which transforms does not transform by its own power—it simply cannot but arise, cannot but transform. [Explanation:] All that has life must die; that which is transformed by things is ever-changing. How can it be without arising and perishing, without transformation and change? Thus, it is ever-arising, ever-transforming. [Annotation:] Those who enter the realm of movement and existence cannot be without it for a moment. That which is ever-arising and ever-transforming arises at all times and transforms at all times. [Annotation:] Arising and transformation follow one another; existence and decay alternate without cease—this principle is uninterrupted. Lu Wenchang notes: The characters \"復往\" (*fùwǎng*) in the annotation should be corrected according to later text.\n\nIt is yin and yang, it is the four seasons—[Annotation:] Yin and yang, the four seasons—things of change and transformation that yet belong to the realm of arising—all follow this shaping and movement. The four seasons change without ceasing; the myriad things transform without rest. [Explanation:] Those shifted by yin and yang and turning with the seasons are all things of form. Moment by moment they change; life and death are endless. Thus, they are ever-arising and ever-transforming. The character \"節\" (*jié*) after \"四時\" (*four seasons*) in all editions is deleted here following the *Four Explanations*.\n\nThat which does not arise is doubtfully solitary. [Annotation:] The master of non-arising—how can it be verified in reality? It is doubtfully darkly unified, without beginning or end. [Explanation:] The spirit has no direction or comparison; thus, it is called solitary. As Laozi says: \"It stands alone and does not change.\" \"Doubtfully\" means not daring to speak decisively to clarify the profound and wondrous. The annotation \"不生之主\" (*master of non-arising*) in all editions is written as \"不生之生\" (*arising of non-arising*).\n\nThat which does not transform goes and returns. *Shiwen* notes: *Fù* (復) is pronounced *fú* in the standard reading; later instances not pronounced follow the entering tone. Going and returning—its bounds cannot be exhausted. [Annotation:] Alternation is uninterrupted; form and qi succeed one another—its Dao does not end. The *Shide Tang*, *Zang*, and *Northern Song* editions do not repeat the characters \"往復\" (*going and returning*).\n\nLu Wenchao said: \"The two characters 'going and returning' (*wangfu*) should be repeated.\" Tao Hongqing said: Zhang’s annotation—\"Alternation is uninterrupted; form and qi succeed one another\"—precisely explains the meaning of \"going and returning,\" indicating that the version he saw was not in error. Wang Chongmin said: The arguments of Lu and Tao are both correct. The Jifu edition correctly repeats the two characters \"going and returning.\" Bo Jun notes: Wang’s view is correct. Here, we follow the Jifu edition and add the repetition.\n\n\"Doubtfully solitary, its Dao cannot be exhausted.\" [Annotation:] How could one know whether it is exhaustible or not? One simply doubts its standing alone and not changing, its circling without peril. [Explanation:] The four seasons transform without end; the spirit’s function in change also cannot be exhausted.\n\nTao Hongqing said: \"Doubt\" means \"to halt.\" The *Erya* explains: \"Doubt (*yi*) means *li* (戾).\" Guo’s annotation says: \"*Li* means to halt. 'Doubt' also means to halt.\" The *Poem* \"Sang Rou\" says, \"There is nowhere to halt in doubt,\" and Xunzi’s *Jiebi* chapter says, \"with nothing to halt in doubt\"—both pair \"doubt\" with \"halt,\" showing they share the same meaning. Here, \"doubtfully solitary\" means halting in solitude. This aligns with the *Daodejing*’s \"Heaven attains the One and becomes clear; Earth attains the One and becomes tranquil.\" Zhang’s \"standing alone and not changing\" precisely captures its essence. To gloss \"doubt\" as \"doubtful hesitation\" is to impose a meaning based on superficial resemblance, which is mistaken.\n\nXu Weiyu said: \"Doubt\" should be read as *ni* (拟), meaning \"to usurp\" or \"to compare.\" The *Guanzi*’s \"Junchen\" chapter says: \"Within the palace, if there are concubines who rival the wife, this is palace disorder; among the commoners, if there are sons who rival the heir, this is family disorder; in the court, if there are ministers who rival the prime minister, this is state disorder.\" (The *Lüshi Chunqiu*’s \"Zhidu\" chapter and the *Shenzi*’s \"Neipian\" have similar passages.) The *Hanfeizi*’s \"Shuoyi\" chapter writes \"doubt\" as *ni*. The *Hanshu*’s \"Shihuo Zhi\" says, \"Those from distant lands who can *ni*,\" and Yan Shigu’s annotation reads, \"*Ni* is read as *ni*.\" These serve as evidence. Here, \"doubtfully solitary\" means \"comparable to solitude,\" forming a paired meaning with the following \"going and returning.\"\n\nZhongfu said: \"End\" (*qiong*) and \"exhaust\" (*qiong*) rhyme, both belonging to the *dong* rhyme group in ancient pronunciation.\n\n*Shiwen* notes: \"*Dai* (殆) is pronounced *dai*.\"\n\nThe *Book of the Yellow Emperor* says: Hui Dong said: This was recorded by Laozi. Laozi’s learning was likely based on the Yellow Emperor, hence the Han dynasty’s term \"Huang-Lao.\" *Shiwen* notes: The Yellow Emperor’s surname was Gongsun, his given name Xuanyuan. He attained the Dao of longevity and reigned for a hundred years. According to the *Hanshu Yiwenzhi*, there were four chapters of the *Book of the Yellow Emperor*, one chapter of *The Yellow Emperor and His Ministers*, and six chapters of *Inscriptions of the Yellow Emperor*, all classified under Daoist works.\n\nBo Jun notes: In the current *Yiwenzhi*, *The Book of the Yellow Emperor* is titled *The Four Classics of the Yellow Emperor*, and *The Yellow Emperor and His Ministers* is ten chapters. Ban’s self-annotation says: \"Originated during the Warring States period, similar to Laozi.\" There are also fifty-eight chapters of *Miscellaneous Writings of the Yellow Emperor*, with Ban’s self-annotation: \"Composed by worthies of the Warring States period.\"\n\n\"The valley spirit does not die,\" [Annotation:] This book existed in ancient times but is now lost. The valley is empty yet contains a dwelling, much like Zhuangzi’s \"ring center.\" Utterly empty and without substance, it is called the valley spirit; inherently without arising, it is said not to die.\n\nBo Jun notes: This is the sixth chapter of the *Laozi*.\n\n\"This is called the Mysterious Female.\" [Annotation:] The *Laozi* contains this chapter. Wang Bi’s commentary says: \"Without form or shadow, without opposition or resistance, abiding in lowliness without movement, guarding stillness without decline—through this the valley is perfected yet its form is unseen. This is the supreme entity. Dwelling in lowliness and beyond naming, it is called the Mysterious Female.\"\n\nYu Zhengxie said: \"Female\" (*pin*) was understood by the ancients as a ravine or valley; the so-called \"empty female\" is akin to what we now call a hollow cavity. Zhu Xi’s *Yulei* says: \"The female is merely the receptive aperture in wood, like a mortise. The Mysterious Female is the most wondrous female, not the same as that particular female.\" His words seem to approach yet depart from the meaning. Upon deep reflection, *yuan* (元) in the *Baihu Tong*’s \"Wuxing\" chapter means \"to enter darkness.\" Thus, *yuan* signifies entering the female. The *Shiwen* of the Tang *Lü*’s \"Weijin Shang\" explains: \"That which has an aperture and can receive entry is called the female.\" That *yuanpin* was an ancient expression is thus evident. To make this explicit is to spare Confucians further discussion.\n\nBo Jun notes: The *Laozi* passage Zhang’s annotation cites—\"hence it is called the Mysterious Female\"—in the current Wang Bi edition reads, \"hence it is called the root of Heaven and Earth.\" *Shiwen* writes \"without shadow\" as \"without *jing*\" (景), and notes: \"*Pin* is pronounced *piren*. *Jing* is read as *ying*.\"\n\n\"The gateway of the Mysterious Female is called the root of Heaven and Earth. Subtly continuous as if existing, its use is inexhaustible.\" [Annotation:] Wang Bi said: \"The gateway is the means by which the Mysterious Female operates. Tracing its origin, it shares the same body as the Great Ultimate, hence it is called the root of Heaven and Earth. Does one wish to speak of its existence? Yet its form is not seen.\"\n\n\"Does one wish to speak of its absence? Yet the myriad things arise through it, hence it is said to be 'subtly continuous as if existing.' No thing is completed without it, yet it does not toil, hence it is said to be 'inexhaustible.'\"\n\n[Exegesis:] The valley is empty, and qi resides within it; the form is hollow, and spirit abides within. \"Mysterious\" denotes the wondrous without form; \"female\" denotes responsiveness without fixed direction. Emerging into life and entering death, nothing does not depend upon it, hence it is called the \"gateway.\" It is the root of the formed, hence it is called the \"root.\" Though unseen when sought, its use is boundless, hence it is said to be \"as if existing.\"\n\nThe exegesis of \"mysterious\" appears as \"primordial\" in the Qin stele. During the Kangxi reign of the Qing, it was likely altered to avoid the emperor’s personal name, Xuanye. Here, the text follows the corrected version of the *Four Exegeses*.\n\nXu Weiyu notes: *Qin* should be glossed as \"exhaust.\" The *Huainanzi*, \"Yuan Dao Xun,\" states: \"So subtle as to be inexhaustible,\" where Gao You comments: \"*Qin* means exhaust.\" In the same chapter, \"its use is inexhaustible,\" Gao again comments: \"*Qin* means toil,\" mistakenly aligning with Zhang’s annotation.\n\nZhongfu observes: \"Female,\" \"gateway,\" \"root,\" and \"inexhaustible\" form a rhyme, all sharing the same ancient sound in the *hun-gen* rhyme group.\n\n*Shiwen* notes: *Mian* is pronounced *wuyan*. *Xie* is read as *yizhe*; the same applies below.\n\nThus, that which gives life does not itself live, and that which transforms does not itself transform.\n\n**[Annotation]** *Zhuangzi* also contains this saying. Xiang Xiu’s commentary states: My life is not something I myself give life to—life simply arises of itself. How could that which gives life to life be a thing? Thus, it does not live. My transformation is not something things transform—transformation simply transforms of itself. How could that which transforms transformation be a thing? It is no-thing, and thus does not transform. If that which gives life were itself to live, and that which transforms were itself to transform, then it would transform along with things—how would it differ from them? Only by being neither born nor transformed can it serve as the root of life and transformation.\n\n**[Exegesis]** This spirit is the master of life, able to give life to and transform things, while nothing can give life to or transform it.\n\nWang Shumin notes: In the annotation, \"Thus, it does not live\" likely omits three characters above *gu* 故 (\"thus\"), reading: \"It is no-thing, and thus does not live,\" to parallel the following: \"It is no-thing, and thus does not transform.\"\n\n**[Pronunciation Notes]** Xiang Xiu: *Xiang* is pronounced *Xiang* (as in *xiang* 饷), courtesy name Ziqī, Jin dynasty Attendant-in-Ordinary, who annotated twenty-eight chapters of the *True Scripture of Southern Florescence*.\n\nLife arises of itself, transformation occurs of itself, form takes shape of itself, color appears of itself, wisdom emerges of itself, strength manifests of itself, dissolution happens of itself, and cessation comes of itself.\n\n**[Annotation]** All these occur spontaneously—how could there be an agent that enacts them?\n\nZhongfu observes: *Color* 色, *strength* 力, and *cessation* 息 rhyme, sharing the same ancient sound in the *zhi-de* rhyme group.\n\nTo call it the giver of life, transformation, form, color, wisdom, strength, dissolution, and cessation would be mistaken.\n\n**[Annotation]** If one were to harbor intent regarding life, transformation, form, or color, how could one govern heaven and earth, store the myriad things, and provide for all beings without omission?\n\n**[Exegesis]** The spirit moves alone, unconstrained by things. If, bound by emotion, one were to equate it with the life and transformation of things, this would not be the Dao.\n\nYu Yue states: *Wei* 谓 (\"to call\") should be *wei* 為 (\"to be\"), as *wei* 谓 and *wei* 為 are interchangeable in ancient texts, as explained in Wang Yinzhi’s *Exegeses of Classical and Historical Words*. The preceding text reads: \"Life arises of itself, transformation occurs of itself, form takes shape of itself, color appears of itself, wisdom emerges of itself, strength manifests of itself, dissolution happens of itself, and cessation comes of itself.\" Thus, this should read: \"To *be* the giver of life, transformation, form, color, wisdom, strength, dissolution, and cessation would be mistaken.\" Zhang Zhan’s annotation to the preceding text—\"All these occur spontaneously—how could there be an agent that enacts them?\"—correctly captures its meaning.\n\nTao Hongqing states: Yu Yue’s *Pingyi* (\"Level Discussions\") reading of *wei* 谓 as *wei* 為 is incorrect. *Wei* 谓 here follows the usage in the *Daodejing*: \"Those of the same *wei* 謂 are called obscure,\" meaning that the myriad things root in the formless, and the formless has no name—thus, to forcibly name it would be mistaken. The following passage, where Liezi states, \"It is not their name,\" with the annotation, \"Things have tangible reality, not merely names by which they are known,\" aligns precisely with this principle. Reading *wei* 謂 as *wei* 為 renders the meaning shallow.\n\nBo Jun notes: In the annotation, \"provide for all beings without omission,\" the *Zang* 藏, *Song* 宋, and *Four Exegeses* editions all write *zhan* 瞻 (\"to gaze\"), while the *Shiwen* 世德堂 edition of the *Pronunciation Notes* writes *shan* 赡 (\"to provide\"). The latter is correct. The *Shuowen* defines *zhan* 瞻 as \"to look down upon,\" while its later supplement defines *shan* 赡 as \"to supply.\" The *Mengzi* *Gongsun Chou* chapter’s annotation glosses *shan* 赡 as \"sufficiency.\" Here, it should mean \"to supply\" or \"to suffice.\" The character *yi* 遗 (\"omission\") in the *Pronunciation Notes* and *Shiwen* edition is written as *kui* 匮 (\"exhaustion\"), but *yi* 遗 is correct. The meaning is: if one were to harbor intent regarding life and transformation, there would inevitably be bias. Now, governing heaven and earth and storing the myriad things without omission shows that these arise and transform of themselves, not through being given life or transformed. Yu Yue’s reading of *wei* 謂 as *wei* 為 yields a smoother meaning. Tao’s refutation is unfounded.\n\n**[Pronunciation Notes]** *Zhi* 智 is written as *zhi* 知 (\"wisdom\"), and *yi* 遗 is written as *kui* 匮 (\"exhaustion\"). *Shan* 赡 is pronounced *shi yan* 時艷. *Kui* 匮 is pronounced *kui* 馈, meaning \"exhaustion.\"\n\nMaster Liezi said: \"In ancient times, the sages relied on yin and yang to govern heaven and earth.\"\n\n**[Annotation]** Heaven and earth refer to form in general; yin and yang clarify their measures, order, and governance.\n\n**[Exegesis]** All things with form have that which gives them life and moves them. The greatest of these are heaven and earth. That which moves heaven and earth is yin and yang. Yin and yang are transformations of qi, without substance or form. Heaven and earth manifest life and death through them. Yin and yang are easy to distinguish, but the spirit’s discernment is difficult to clarify. Using these as analogies for that establishes the pattern, revealing that the spirit governs form, and nothing gives life to it.\n\nThat which has form is born from that which has no form.\n\n**[Annotation]** To call it \"born\" is not to say it is not without; to call it \"without\" is not to say it is not born. Thus, the mutual non-birth of being and non-being is a principle that is already so—how then could being arise? It suddenly arises of itself. Arising suddenly of itself, it does not know why it arises. Not knowing why it arises, its arising is fundamentally identical to non-being. Fundamentally identical to non-being, yet it is not non-being. This clarifies that the self-arising of form does not rely on the formless to give it form.\n\n**[Annotation]** In \"To call it 'born' is not to say it is not without,\" the *Shiwen* edition writes *wu* 無 (\"without\") as *si* 死 (\"death\"), likely due to the graphic similarity of *wu* 無 and *si* 死, compounded by the semantic association with *sheng* 生 (\"life\").\n\nThen how could heaven and earth arise?\n\n**[Annotation]** Heaven and earth have no source from which they arise—they arise naturally.\n\n**[Exegesis]** Heaven and earth are the greatest of forms. Yin and yang are not spirit or discernment. If that which has form were born from that which has no form, would heaven and earth possess spirit, discernment, mind, or nature? If they are without these, from what could they arise? This hypothetical question aims to clarify that the myriad things have that which gives them life.\n\n**[Annotation]** In \"they arise naturally,\" the *Taiping Yulan* quotes this as \"they arise of themselves.\"\n\nThus, it is said: There is the Great Simplicity, the Great Beginning, the Great Inception, and the Great Simplicity.\n\nHere the text clarifies how things evolve from the subtle to the manifest, with transformations following one another in succession. The *Taiping Yulan* quotes the annotation as: \"This clarifies how things begin from the subtle to the manifest, with transformations naturally following one another in succession.\"\n\nThe *Shiwen* notes that \"太\" is written as \"大,\" reading *dà* as *tài*, and the same applies below.\n\n**Great Simplicity (太易)** is the state before qi is visible.\n**[Annotation]** *Yi* (易) signifies that which is unbound and unobstructed. Congealed in the realm of the Great Void, what could be perceived there? It is like the *Taiji* in the *Yi Jing* or the \"primordial unity\" of Laozi.\n**[Annotation]** In the phrase \"what could be perceived,\" the character \"耶\" in the Northern Song edition and *Sijie* is written as \"即,\" attaching to the following sentence; the *Shide Tang* edition writes \"也.\"\n**[Shiwen]** \"浑\" is written as \"混,\" reading *hún* as *hùn*. *See* (见) is pronounced *xiàn* (贤遍切), and the same applies in the annotation. *Chēng* (称) is pronounced *chèng* (尺证切), and the same applies below. *Xì* (系) is pronounced *jì* (胡计切). *Hùn* (混) is pronounced *hún* (胡本切).\nRen Dachun notes: The *Shan Hai Jing* speaks of \"Hundun without face or eyes,\" and *Zhuangzi* says, \"Hundun was drilled by Shu and Hu,\" where *Hundun* (浑敦) is *Hundun* (混沌). In the *Han Shu*, Liu Xiang’s biography reads \"the worthy and unworthy are mixed and confused,\" where *hùn* (浑) is read as *hún* (混), showing that *hùn* and *hún* are interchangeable.\n\n**Great Beginning (太初)** is the inception of qi.\n**[Annotation]** Before yin and yang separate, this is what the following sentence calls \"primordial chaos\" (*hunlun*).\n\n**Great Inception (太始)** is the inception of form.\n**[Annotation]** Once yin and yang have separated, the myriad things flow into form.\n\n**Great Simplicity (太素)** is the inception of substance.\n**[Annotation]** *Zhi* (质) means nature. Once things exist, they possess square or round, hard or soft, still or restless, sinking or floating qualities—each with its own nature.\n\nWhen qi, form, and substance are all present but not yet separated—\n**[Annotation]** This directly discusses qi, form, and substance, no longer mentioning the Great Simplicity. The Great Simplicity is the origin of these three, which will be clarified in the following sentence.\nThe *Lushi Qianji* includes the character \"与\" after \"气.\"\n**[Shiwen]** *Lí* (离) is pronounced *lì* (力智切), meaning \"to separate.\" Some read it in the level tone. \"Near\" is called *lí* (离), \"far\" is called *bié* (别); the rest may be inferred by analogy. *Bié* (别) is pronounced *bǐngliè* (彼列切).\n\n—it is called **primordial chaos (浑沦)**.\n**[Shiwen]** *Hún* (浑) is pronounced *hún* (魂), *lún* (沦) is pronounced *lún* (论), and the same applies below.\n\n**Primordial chaos (浑沦)** means the myriad things are intermingled yet not separated.\n**[Annotation]** Though they form a single undifferentiated qi without dispersion, the Dao of the Three Powers is already latent within it. *Lún* (沦) is a grammatical particle.\n**[Shiwen]** *Sàn* (散) is pronounced *sǎn* (先汗切), and the same applies throughout the volume.\n\nIt cannot be seen, heard, or grasped by tracing—hence it is called *yi* (易).\nWang Chongmin notes: *Xún* (循) should be read as *tún* (揗). The *Shuowen* defines *tún* as \"to rub.\" The *Han Shu*’s *Annals of Emperor Gao* reads, \"thereupon he patted his back,\" with Yan Shigu’s annotation: \"*Fǔ* (拊) means to rub and stroke.\" Later, *fǔtún* (拊揗) was written as *xún* (循). Examples include the *Shiji*’s *Hereditary House of Jin*: \"Zifan gathered the remaining troops, patting and encouraging them to fight again,\" and the *Han Shu*’s *Biography of Zhao Chongguo*: \"patting and soothing to harmonize and unite.\" *Tún* is the original character; *xún* is the loan character.\n**[Shiwen]** *Xún* (循) is pronounced *xún* (旬).\n\nThe *Yi* has no form or boundary—\n**[Annotation]** The character following this is unknown. Laozi says, \"That which cannot be seen is called *xi* (希),\" while here it is called *yi* (易). *Yi* is another name for simplicity and subtlety.\nThe meaning of the Great Simplicity is thus: it serves as the origin of all transformations, remaining obscurely unified and unchanging.\n**[Annotation]** In the Northern Song edition, \"埒\" is written as \"□\"; Wang’s edition also writes \"□.\" Here, it is corrected following the *Sijie* edition.\n**[Shiwen]** \"埒\" is written as \"□,\" noting: The *Huainanzi* writes \"form and boundary,\" meaning signs and omens. The *Qianzao Du* writes \"form □.\" The current reading follows the character *hū* (乎), which is considered an error.\nRen Dachun notes: The *Huainanzi*’s *Benjing Xun* reads, \"Qi coalesces to transform things, forming boundaries and categories,\" with Gao You’s annotation: \"*Liè* (埒) means form.\" The *Yaolüe Xun* reads, \"signs of form and boundary,\" the *Muzheng Xun* reads, \"those with chapters, form, and boundary,\" and the *Binglüe Xun* reads, \"those with form and boundary are publicly visible in the world.\" In all cases, *liè* (埒) is written as *liè* (埒). The *Shuowen*, *Yupian*, and *Guangyun* include *liè* but not *□*; the *Leipian* includes *□*, defining it as \"to raise earth while plowing,\" sharing the same meaning as \"the king plows once.\" *Liè* (埒) and *□* have different meanings; *liè* written as *□* is a loan character.\nJing Shun’s *Shiwen* states: \"Now following *hū* (乎) is considered an error.\" Examining the *Huainanzi*’s *Yaolüe Xun*: \"Yínghū (嬴垀) embodies the nature of being and non-being,\" where the *Leipian* defines *hū* (垀) as *liè* (埒)—this is what Jing Shun refers to as \"following *hū*.\" The meaning of *hū* (垀) is the same as *hū* (乎), and *liè* (埒) derives from *hū* (乎), so the meaning is naturally coherent. Yet Jing Shun calls it an error—his reasoning is unclear.\n\nThe *Yi* transforms into the One—\n**[Annotation]** The so-called *yi* is profound and indistinct, beyond transformation. Qi relies on it to transform, so it is provisionally named \"transformation.\"\nThe *Taiping Yulan* quotes the annotation with \"恃\" written as \"持.\"\n**[Shiwen]** *Huǎng* (恍) is written as *huǎng* (怳), noting: From the One through the Nine, these are the numbers of the *Dayan*.\n*Hū* (惚) is pronounced *hū* (忽). *Huǎng* (怳) is pronounced *kuàngwǎng* (况往切).\n\n—one transforms into seven, seven transforms into nine. Nine transformations are the culmination.\n**[Annotation]** *Jiū* (究) means \"to exhaust.\" The transformation from one to seven and nine does not follow sequential numbers; rather, it fully presents the yang numbers to encompass their convergence.\nHu Huaichen notes: Zhang’s annotation is not entirely clear. The Chinese numerical system states either: \"One generates two, two generates three, three generates the myriad things\" (as in the *Laozi*), or \"one becomes two, two generates four, four generates eight\" (as in the *Taiji*, Two Modes, Four Images, and Eight Trigrams).\n\nThe explanation can be found in the *Appended Judgments* of the *Book of Changes*. The statement that \"one transforms into seven, seven transforms into nine\" originates from the *Qian Zaodu* of the *Weft of the Changes*.\n\n*(Zhang’s annotation includes: \"This entire chapter is from the *Qian Zaodu* of the *Weft of the Changes*.\")*\n\nHowever, the principle behind \"one transforming into seven, seven transforming into nine\" remains ultimately inexplicable. The *Shiwen* notes: \"*Shu* (数) is pronounced *sèzhǔ* (色主切). It then transforms again into one.\"\n\nYu Yue states: The first \"*bian* (变, transform)\" is superfluous text. Originally, it read: \"Nine is the culmination of *qi* transformation, which then reverts to one.\" Due to the influence of the preceding phrase \"one transforms, seven transforms,\" it was mistakenly written as \"nine transformations,\" rendering the wording redundant.\n\nSun Yirang says: This chapter aligns with the text of the *Qian Zaodu* in the *Weft of the Changes*. In the *Weft*, \"Nine is the culmination of *qi* transformation\" corresponds precisely with the subsequent phrase \"One is the beginning of form transformation.\" In this text, the character *bian* (变) was erroneously transposed above *zhe* (者), and the two characters *qi zhi* (气之) were omitted.\n\nWang Chongmin says: Sun’s interpretation is correct. The *Taiping Imperial Encyclopedia* cites it as \"Nine transformations are the culmination,\" which also contains errors. The edition consulted by the *Imperial Encyclopedia* had already omitted the character *qi* (气) and, influenced by \"one transforms, seven transforms,\" mistakenly moved *bian* (变) above *zhe* (者). Later scholars, deeming *zhi* (之) redundant, arbitrarily deleted it. Fortunately, the preserved *zhi* (之) in the citation suffices to prove that the original text of the *Liezi* matched that of the *Weft of the Changes*. Yu Yue’s claim that *bian* (变) is superfluous is incorrect.\n\nWang Shumin says: Sun’s interpretation is correct. The *Dharma Garden Pearl Forest*, Volume 7, cites it as \"Nine is the culmination of transformation,\" omitting only the character *qi* (气). The *Shiwen* writes *nai* (乃) as *nai* (乃), noting: *Nai* (乃) is an ancient form of *nai* (乃).\n\nOne is the beginning of form transformation.\n**[Annotation]** Once entering the realm of form, principle and number mutually evolve, proceeding from one to nine. When the nine numbers reach their end, they revert to one. Reverting to one returns to the beginning of form transformation. This illustrates that transformations and changes recur endlessly without limit.\n\nWhat is pure and light ascends to become Heaven.\n*(The *Shiwen* notes: \"Ascends\" is pronounced *shízhǎng* (时掌切).)*\n\nWhat is turbid and heavy descends to become Earth.\n**[Annotation]** What are Heaven and Earth? They are simply the self-differentiation of emptiness and fullness, purity and turbidity.\n\n*(The *Wen Xuan* commentary on Pan Anren’s \"Western Expedition Rhapsody\" cites \"pure and light\" and \"turbid and heavy\" as \"light and pure\" and \"heavy and turbid.\")*\n\nWhat is harmonious *qi* becomes Human.\n*(The *Wen Xuan* commentary on the \"Western Expedition Rhapsody\" cites this as \"harmonious *qi*.\")*\n\nTao Hongqing says: *Chong* (冲) should be read as *zhong* (中). The *Nine Safeguards* chapter of the *Wenzi* states: \"Thus, the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors had vessels of admonition called *youzhi*, whose *chong* (冲) was upright; when full, they overturned.\" *Chong* (冲) here means *zhong* (中). Furthermore, the *Sincerity* chapter reads: \"Grasping the *chong* (冲) and embracing harmony,\" while the *Tai Zu* chapter of the *Huainanzi* writes *chong* (冲) as *zhong* (中), both demonstrating the interchangeability of *chong* (冲) and *zhong* (中). This aligns with the preceding \"ascends to become Heaven, descends to become Earth,\" forming a coherent meaning. *Zhonghe qi* (中和气) refers to dwelling in the center of harmonious *qi*. The *Superior Virtue* chapter of the *Wenzi* states: \"The myriad things bear yin and embrace yang, with harmonious *qi* residing in the center,\" which conveys the same meaning.\n\nThus, Heaven and Earth contain essence, and the myriad things transform and come into being.\n**[Annotation]** Extending this reasoning, when yin and yang *qi* universally intermingle and harmonize, harmonious *qi* gives rise to human life. Human life thus has a foundation upon which to stand.\n\n**[Exegesis]** One, three, five, seven, and nine are the numbers of yang. When they reach their extreme, they revert to one, circulating endlessly. The *Book of Changes* states: \"That which is rooted in Heaven inclines upward; that which is rooted in Earth inclines downward.\" What inclines downward comprises grasses and trees; what inclines upward comprises sentient beings. Thus, animals possess spirit, while plants lack consciousness. Those without consciousness are transformed by *qi*; those with spirit are shifted by consciousness. Hence, it is said: From *Taiyi* and *Taichu* to *Hunlun*, this describes the gradual progression of *qi*. Within it, the most refined and essential is called *shen* (spirit). Those with refined and subtle *shen* and *qi* become worthy or sagely; those with mixed and turbid *shen* and *qi* become ordinary or foolish. Even among living beings, distinctions abound, resulting in manifold classifications.\n\nZhongfu says: The *Appended Judgments* of the *Book of Changes* states: \"When male and female unite their essence, yin and yang transform and give birth.\"\n\n*(Bo Jun notes: The *Exegesis* cites the *Book of Changes* from the *Wenyan* commentary. Additionally, *jing* (精, essence) and *sheng* (生, birth) rhyme, both belonging to the ancient *geng-qing* rhyme group.)*\n\nThe *Exegesis* states: *Yǐ* is pronounced as *yú qǐ*.\n\nMaster Liezi says: \"Heaven and Earth possess no complete efficacy, the sage possesses no complete ability, and the myriad things possess no complete utility.\n*(Annotation: \"Complete\" means \"perfectly equipped.\")*\nThus, Heaven’s duty is to give life and provide cover, Earth’s duty is to shape and bear, the sage’s duty is to teach and transform, and things fulfill their proper roles.\n*(Annotation: \"Duty\" means \"to preside over.\" Each life has its nature, and each nature has its proper function.)*\nYet Heaven has its shortcomings, Earth has its strengths, the sage has his limitations—*(the *Exegesis* reads \"what Heaven and Earth block,\" with *pǐ* pronounced *pú bǐ*, meaning \"obstruction\")*—and things have their penetrations.\n*(Annotation: That which is suited to one direction becomes obstructed when applied elsewhere.)*\nWang Bi says: 'Form must have its divisions, sound must have its categories. If it is warm, it cannot be cool; if it is *gong*, it cannot be *shang*.'\"\n\nZhongfu notes: The *Qunshu Zhiyao* cites this passage with *tǐ* (\"duty\") in place of *zhí* (\"body\") and *wǎng* (\"nowhere\") in place of *hé* (\"obstruction\").\n\n*(Bo Jun notes: The *Zhuangzi*'s \"Under Heaven\" chapter records the words of Peng Meng, Tian Pian, and Shen Dao: \"Heaven can cover but cannot bear, Earth can bear but cannot cover, the Great Dao can encompass but cannot discriminate. All things have what they can and cannot do.\" This conveys the same idea, though expressed differently, hence their conclusions diverge.)*\n\n*(The *Exegesis* states: *Zào* is pronounced *qī dào*, *hé* sounds like *ài*, and *shǔ* sounds like *zhú*.)*\n\nWhy is this so? That which gives life and cover cannot shape and bear; that which shapes and bears cannot teach and transform; that which teaches and transforms cannot defy what is proper—*(Annotation: Following it brings penetration.)*—and what is fixed in propriety does not transgress its position.\n*(Annotation: All have their inherent divisions, which cannot be reversed.)*\n*(Bo Jun notes: There appears to be a missing \"can\" before \"does not transgress its position,\" making \"cannot transgress its position\" parallel to the preceding three \"cannot\" clauses. The following sentence, \"cannot transgress its position,\" includes \"can,\" confirming this. Zhang’s annotation suggests his edition was not yet corrupted.)*\n\n*(The *Exegesis* states: *Fèn* is pronounced *fú wèn*; the same applies to \"name divisions\" and \"form divisions\" below.)*\n\nThus, the Dao of Heaven and Earth is either yin or yang; the sage’s teachings are either benevolence or righteousness; the proper roles of the myriad things are either soft or hard. These all follow what is proper and cannot transgress their positions.\n*(Annotation: Stillness and movement, square and round—principles cannot be combined. Yet when examining forms and affairs, their divisions cannot encroach upon one another. When following the penetration of principle, square and round need not conflict. Thus, the virtue of the Two Modes and the Dao of the sage nurture and sustain all life, pervading the myriad things, exhausting only their purity, tranquility, integrity, and essence. Then, divergent paths merge, movement and stillness become one—this arises from the sage not opposing the natures of the myriad things, and the myriad things not violating the sage’s transformative influence. All that is fixated on one direction is obstructed by its form’s divisions. The operation of the Dao is ever profoundly penetrating and without dependence.)*\n\n*(Annotation: The movement of qi enables covering and bearing; the movement of spirit enables teaching and transformation. Thus, Heaven and Earth give life to the myriad things, and the sage employs them according to their forms.)*\n\nZhongfu notes: In the annotation, *jìng zào* (\"stillness and movement\") is cited in the *Qunshu Zhiyao* as *jìng zào* (\"tranquility and movement\").\n\n*(The *Exegesis* states: *Dào* is pronounced *dǎo*, meaning \"to cover\"; *cuì* sounds like *suì*.)*\n\nThus, there are those that are born, and those that give birth; there are those that have form, and those that give form; there are those that have sound, and those that give sound; there are those that have color, and those that give color; there are those that have flavor, and those that give flavor.\n*(Annotation: Form, sound, color, and flavor all arise in an instant yet cannot generate themselves. That which cannot generate itself is the root of non-action. The root of non-action has no attachment to a single image, no bond to a single flavor—thus it can be the master of form and qi, and all movement must proceed from it.)*\n\n*(Annotation: The beginning of having form is called \"birth\"; that which can give birth to this birth is called \"form and spirit.\" That which can form its form, sound its sound, color its color, and flavor its flavor—all are the work of spirit, using the insubstantial to govern the substantial. In the annotation, \"no attachment to a single image,\" *dāng* (\"attachment\") is written as *liú* (\"to remain\") in the Shide Hall edition.)*\n\n*(Wang Lai notes: In Lu’s annotation, \"called 'form and spirit,'\" the character *xíng* (\"form\") is superfluous.)*\n\n*(The *Exegesis* states: *Xì* sounds like *jì*.)*\n\nThat which is born by the born dies, yet that which gives birth never ends; that which is formed by form is substantial, yet that which gives form never exists; that which is sounded by sound is heard, yet that which gives sound never emits; that which is colored by color is manifest, yet that which gives color never appears; that which is flavored by flavor is tasted, yet that which gives flavor never presents itself.\n*(Annotation: That which is exhausted in one form all change and transform with the passing of time. Thus, the born must end, but that which gives birth to life knows no alteration.)*\n\n*(The *Exegesis* states: *Chéng* means \"to manifest.\")*\n\nAll are the duties of non-action.\n*(Annotation: The utterly insubstantial can thus be the master of all transformations.)*\n\n*(Annotation: What spirit operates has a beginning and must have an end. Form, sound, color, and flavor—none can distinguish themselves. That which subtly operates is the sublime work of spirit, non-acting yet nothing left undone.)*\n\n*(Bo Jun notes: The *Huainanzi*'s \"Spirit and Essence\" chapter states: \"That which transforms returns to formlessness; that which does not transform is born together with Heaven and Earth. When wood dies, its greenness departs. That which causes wood to live—is it wood? It is like that which fills form yet is not form. Thus, that which gives life never dies, but what it gives life to dies; that which transforms never transforms, but what it transforms is transformed.\" This can serve as a commentary on this passage.)*\n\nThe Way can be yin and can be yang,\ncan be soft and can be hard,\ncan be short and can be long,\ncan be round and can be square,\ncan give life and can bring death,\ncan be hot and can be cool,\ncan float and can sink,\ncan be gong and can be shang,\ncan emerge and can submerge,\ncan be dark and can be yellow,\ncan be sweet and can be bitter,\ncan be rank and can be fragrant.\n\n*(Jiang Yougao notes: \"Yang, hard, square, cool, shang, yellow, and fragrant\" all rhyme, as they belonged to the same yang rhyme group in ancient pronunciation.)*\n*(The *Shiwen* states: \"膻 is pronounced *shi lian*.\")*\n\nIt is without knowledge, yet without inability,\nand without knowing, yet without incapacity.\n*(Annotation: When knowledge is exhausted, it becomes non-knowledge; when ability is perfected, it becomes non-ability. Thus, there is nothing it does not know, nothing it cannot do.)*\n\nHe Yan’s *Discourse on the Dao* states:\n*\"Being arises from non-being;\naffairs are accomplished through non-affairs.\nThe Dao speaks not when it acts,\nis nameless when named,\nformless when seen,\nsoundless when heard—\nsuch is the wholeness of the Dao.\nThus, it illumines sound and emits the qi of things,\nembraces form and spirit, and manifests light and shadow.\nThrough the dark, blackness arises;\nthrough the plain, whiteness arises;\nthrough the carpenter’s square, squareness arises;\nthrough the compass, roundness arises.\nRound and square attain form, yet this remains formless;\nblack and white attain names, yet this remains nameless.\"*\n\n*(Exegesis: Laozi said, \"I know not whose child it is—it seems to precede the Lord of Heaven.\" This refers to this spirit. It precedes Heaven and Earth, spirits and gods, yet none can know it, none can verify it. If one can embody and verify this Dao, then within Heaven and Earth, there is nothing one does not know, nothing one cannot do.)*\n\n*(The phrase \"relies on non-being to arise\" is identical in the Northern Song edition and the Zang edition; the Shide Hall edition mistakenly writes \"awaits\" due to graphic similarity.)*\n*(In Lu’s exegesis, the Qin dynasty engraving erroneously writes \"夫\" for \"天\"; this follows the Four Exegeses edition in correction.)*\n*(The *Shiwen* writes \"响\" for \"向\" and \"景\" for \"影,\" and notes: \"论 is pronounced *lu kun*. 恃 is pronounced *shi*. 名 is pronounced *mi zheng*, identical to 詺. 响 is pronounced *xu liang*. 景 is pronounced *ying*.\")*\n\nWhen Master Liezi traveled to Wei, he ate by the roadside. His followers saw a century-old skull. *(Tao Hongqing notes: When Liezi pointed to the skull amid the reeds to show his disciple Bai Feng, it should not say \"his followers.\" The *Zhuangzi*’s \"Autumn Waters\" chapter writes \"from [the road] saw a century-old skull,\" omitting the word \"者.\" This should be followed. \"From saw\" is a phrase continuing the above, meaning \"saw it by the roadside.\" (The *Zhuangzi* *Shiwen* mistakenly treats \"道\" and \"从\" as a compound, citing Sima Biao’s gloss: \"从 means roadside.\" This is incorrect.) Later readers mispronounced \"从\" as *zòng* and arbitrarily added \"者,\" disrupting the coherence of the passage.)*\n*(Bo Jun notes: Tao’s interpretation of \"从见\" as \"saw by the roadside\" is an over-expansion. \"从\" should follow the *Shiwen* in being read as *tú*, a graphic error. The *Odes*’ \"Wang Feng\" chapter’s \"Zhong Gu You Tui\" commentary states: \"徒 is used to express the severity of famine years,\" with the *Shiwen* citing Shen’s note: \"徒 should be 作从.\" The \"Zai Chi\" commentary of the \"Qi Feng\" chapter states: \"徒 refers to licentious conduct,\" with the *Shiwen* noting: \"徒 appears as 从 in one edition.\" These are all examples. \"徒\" and \"涂\" are homophonous in antiquity. \"食于道徒\" means \"ate by the roadside.\" (Interpreting it as \"roadside\" lacks ancient evidence.) Guo Qingfan’s *Zhuangzi Jishi* notes that the \"Heaven’s Auspices\" chapter of the *Liezi* originally writes \"食于道徒,\" and Guo’s edition of the *Liezi* includes this variant. This should be adopted. The word \"者\" was added by later readers; Tao’s observation is correct. However, Tao mistakenly cites the \"Perfect Joy\" chapter of the *Zhuangzi* as \"Autumn Waters,\" an oversight.)*\n*(The *Shiwen* writes \"食于道徒\" and notes: \"Sima Biao states: '徒 means roadside.' One edition writes 从.\")*\n*(髑髅 is pronounced *dú lóu*.)*\n\nHe plucked a reed and pointed, saying to his disciple Bai Feng:\n*\"Only you and it know that you have never been born and have never died.*\n*(Annotation: Both traverse the path of transformation—thus, I am born while it dies.)\"*\n\nAt the ultimate extremity of this inquiry, principle admits neither birth nor death.\n\n*(Exegesis: Form is subject to birth and death, but spirit knows neither death nor birth. As my spirit abides, so his spirit departs. Though the skull and I differ in birth and death, if one awakens to its spirit, there is no birth or death.)*\n\nIs this beyond nurture? Is this beyond joy?\n\n*(Annotation: Encountering form, one cannot but nurture; meeting life, one cannot but rejoice—these are the errors of the deluded, not the true reality of principle.)*\n\n*(Exegesis: Once form is received, joy and nurture lose their proper measure, leading only to death.)*\n\nHong Yi remarks: In the *Zhuangzi*’s \"Perfect Joy\" chapter, both instances of \"beyond\" (*guo*) are written as \"fruit\" (*guo*). The *Guoyu*’s \"Discourses of Jin\" writes \"Zhi Guo,\" while the *Hanshu*’s \"Table of Ancient and Modern Persons\" writes \"Zhi Guo.\" *Guo* (\"beyond\") is here *guo* (\"fruit\"), a loan character.\n\nYu Yue states: *Yang* (\"nurture\") should be read as *yang* (\"affliction\"). The *Erya*’s \"Explaining Words\" glosses *yang* as \"worry.\" *Yang* (\"affliction\") and *huan* (\"joy\") stand in opposition, just as worry and joy do. *Yang* (\"affliction\") and *yang* (\"nurture\") are anciently interchangeable. The *Book of Songs*’ \"The Two Sons Board a Boat\" reads *zhongxin yangyang* (\"the heart’s affliction\"), with the *Preface* glossing *yang* as \"worry\"—this follows the *Erya*’s definition.\n\nThe *Shiwen* notes: *Guo* is pronounced *gu wo*; *dang* is pronounced *ding lang*.\n\nThe kinds of transformation number several: [Note] First inquiring into the total number of transformative kinds, then clarifying them below.\n\nTao Hongqing states: *Ji* (\"several\") should be read as *ji* (\"mechanism\"). In the \"Yellow Emperor\" chapter, phrases like \"the virtue/power of Du is *ji*,\" \"the good is *ji*,\" and \"the qi of the balance is *ji*\"—all instances of *ji* in *Zhuangzi* are written as *ji* (\"mechanism\"), which serves as precedent. *Ji* (\"mechanism\") refers to the passage below: \"All things emerge from the *ji* and enter into the *ji*.\" Zhang’s commentary and Yin’s exegesis both read *ji* in the third tone and treat it as an interrogative, which is incorrect.\n\nThe *Shiwen* notes: *Zhong* (\"kind\") is pronounced *ju yong*; *ji* is pronounced *ju qi*.\n\nIf it becomes a quail, [Note] The event is recorded in *Mozi*.\n\nWang Shumin states: The *Erya Yiyi* (15) and *Yuhai*’s supplementary notes to the *Jijiu Pian* (4) both write this as \"frog\" (*wa*), with the character \"化\" (\"transform\") added below. *Wa* (\"frog\") is a vulgar form of *zhi* (\"quail\").\n\nThe *Shiwen* notes: *Chun* (\"quail\") is pronounced *chun*.\n\nBo Jun’s note: The modern pronunciation is *chun*. *Jian* (\"see\") is pronounced *xian bian*.\n\n*Mozi* states: \"Of things, some endure long, some do not. The beginning is without duration.\" Transformation occurs thus: *Mozi*’s *Jingshuo Shang* reads: \"The beginning (phrase). Time may endure long or not; the beginning is without duration.\" Sun Yirang’s *Xian Gu* notes that the *Liezi*’s *Shiwen* cites \"beginning\" as \"of things,\" likely an error.\n\nWhen it obtains water, it becomes *xu*. Wang Xianqian states: The *Erya*’s \"Explaining Plants\" reads: \"*Xu*, ox-lips.\" Guo’s commentary cites the *Mao Shi Zhuan*: \"Water *xi* (*xu*), resembling *xuduan* (teasel), jointed every inch; when pulled, it regrows.\" The *Shuowen* reads: \"*Xu*, water *xi*.\" Hao Yixing states: \"Now examining what grows in water, its flowers resemble plantain but are larger. When pulled, it regrows joint by joint, hence the name *xu*.\" Some write it as *duan* (\"broken\") or *xuduan* (\"teasel\"), but *xu* may have been mistaken for *duan*, and later generations erroneously added \"continuing.\" *Xu* resembles *xuduan* but is distinct from the *xuduan* that grows in mountain valleys. As it regrows joint by joint without roots anchoring to soil, it is called water *xi*, aligning with the text’s \"obtains water and becomes *xu*.\"\n\nThe *Shiwen* notes: *Xu* is pronounced *ji*. Sima Biao states: Though all things bear signs, only when they receive the moistening qi of water do they successively arise.\n\nWhen it obtains the boundary of water and soil, it becomes the covering of *pin*. [Note] *Yi* (\"covering\") means to overlay.\n\nWang Xianqian states: The *Erya*’s \"Explaining Plants\" reads: \"*Yu xie*.\" Guo’s commentary: \"Now called marsh *xie*,\" which is *zexie* (water plantain). The *Bencao* reads: \"Also called water discharge\" (i.e., water *xi*). Tao’s commentary: \"Leaves narrow and long, growing in clusters in shallow water.\" Su Song’s *Tu Jing*: \"Leaves resemble *niushecao* (plantain), single and long; in autumn, it blooms white flowers in clusters, resembling *gujingcao* (pipewort). Roots are harvested in late autumn and dried.\" Here, \"obtaining the intersection of water and soil,\" it develops roots that can be harvested.\n\nMa Xulun states: The *Erya*’s \"Explaining Plants\" reads: \"*Tan*, stone covering.\" Hao Yixing states: \"*Tan* and *tai* (moss) are phonetically interchangeable. The *Shuowen* reads: '*Pi*, water covering.' *Pi* is moss. Water covering is stone covering, also called fish covering.\" The *Zhouli*’s \"Hairen\" reads: \"The additions to the *bian* vessels include *pi* pickles.\" Zheng Zhong’s commentary: \"*Pi* is the fish covering in water\" (based on the early Zheng’s explanation; the character should be *pi*; later Zheng wrote *chi*, thus interpreting it as arrow sprouts. Modern *Zhouli* editions write *pi*, likely a later conflation of *pi* and *chi* into one character. However, the covering of *pin* is fish covering). *Pin*—the *Shuowen* writes it as *pin*; the *Erya*’s \"Explaining Fish\" writes it as *bi*; the *Shanhai Jing*’s \"Western Mountains\" writes it as *□*. The *Shuowen* reads: \"*Ping*, steps, then.\" *Bi* is borrowed for *bi* (*bivalve*); *bi* is clam.\n\nThe *Shiwen* reads: *Pin* is pronounced *bu tian*. Sima Biao states: The roots of things lie at the water-soil boundary, spreading in water; viewed from above the water, they are unseen, but when scooped, they can be obtained—like stretched silk in water. The people of Chu call this the covering of *pin*.\n\nBo Jun’s note: The modern *Zhuangzi Shiwen* writes \"scooped\" as \"pressed.\"\n\nWhen it grows on a mound, [Note] *Ling tun* (\"mound\") refers to a high and pure place.\n\nThe *Shiwen* writes *jie* (\"pure\") as *jie* (\"knotted\"), noting: *Tun* is pronounced *tun* (piglet), meaning mound. *Chu* (\"place\") is pronounced *chang ju*; the same below.\n\nIt becomes *ling xi*. [Note] This changes according to the place where it grows.\n\nWang Xianqian states: The *Shi Jing*’s *Fou Wei* *Shiwen* cites Lu Ji: \"Ox-tongue is also called *dangdao*.\" The *Han Shi* commentary: \"Growing straight is called *cheqian* (plantain); growing on the sides is called *fou wei*,\" distinguishing between those growing on straight paths and those on path edges. The straight path is *dangdao*, both aligning with \"grows on a mound.\"\n\nThe *Shiwen* notes: *Ling xi* is pronounced *xi* (past); also called marsh *xi*, changing with dryness and moisture.\n\nBo Jun’s note: This also cites Sima’s text.\n\nWhen *ling xi* obtains *yuqi* (fertile soil), it becomes crow’s foot. [Note] This arises from their combination.\n\nThe character \"者\" (\"that which\") in the note is added following the *Zangben* and *Sijieben*.\n\nThe *Shiwen* notes: *Yuqi* is manure soil. *Wuzu* is the name of a plant. The roots of *wuzu* become *qicao* (grubs). The *Yulin* (945) cites this as \"the roots of *wuzu* become *qicao*.\"\n\nWang Xianqian states: The *Erya*’s \"Explaining Insects\" reads: \"*Fei*, *qicao*.\" Guo’s commentary: \"Found in dung soil.\" *Fei* may be a phonetic loan for *fen* (dung). *Wuzu* transforms from *ling xi* in dung soil; its roots lie in dung soil, emerging as *qicao*. The *Bencao*: \"*Feiqi* grows in the marshes of Henan and in accumulated dung and grass among households; those that move backward are good.\"\n\nTao’s commentary states, \"*Qi* is also written as *ci*.\" *Fangyan* reads, \"*Cicao* is called *fei*.\" *Qi* and *ci* share the same initial sound.\n\nMa Xulun says: *Qicao* is not *caoqi*. Han Baosheng, Su Song, and Chen Cangqi all distinguish between them. *Lunheng*’s \"On the Absence of Form\" states, \"*Qicao* transforms into *fuyu*, and *fuyu* in turn becomes the cicada.\" Chen Cangqi says, \"*Qicao* dwells in dung soil, its body short and legs long, with bristles along its back; it molts from summer into autumn to become the cicada.\" Li Shizhen says, \"*Qicao* resembles a silkworm but is larger, its body short with compact segments, legs long and hairy. Those born in tree roots and dung soil are yellow outside and black within; those born in old thatched roofs are white outside and dark within.\"\n\nThe *Shiwen* notes: Guo’s commentary to the *Erya* states, \"Found in wood. Though now commonly called *xie*, their habitats differ.\" Its leaves become butterflies.\n\n[Note] The root is the origin; the leaves are the dispersion. This means *wuzu* is the origin of *qicao*, and its dispersed form transforms into butterflies. The note’s \"its dispersed\" (*qi wei*) appears as \"its not yet\" (*qi wei*) in the Northern Song edition; Wang’s edition follows this, but the present text adopts the *Sijieben* correction.\n\nThe *Shiwen* reads: *Die* is pronounced *ye*, referring to the butterfly. *Jia* is pronounced *jia*. *Hudie* (butterfly) is *xu*.\n\n[Note] *Xu* means \"all,\" indicating that all things transform. Transforming into insects, Yu Yue says: \"‘*Xu ye*’ should be read with the following clause, originally stating, ‘*Hudie xu ye hua er wei chong*’ (butterflies all transform into insects), paralleling the later phrase ‘*Quduo* after a thousand days becomes a bird.’ ‘A thousand days to become a bird’ denotes a long duration; ‘all transforming into insects’ denotes swiftness.\"\n\nThe *Shiwen* notes: According to Master’s teaching, *xu* means \"brief,\" referring to a short span of time. Born beneath the stove,\n\nThe *Shiwen* reads: Generated by warmth. Its form resembles *tuo*,\n\nThe *Shiwen* reads: *Tuo* is pronounced *thekuo*. Guo’s commentary to the *Erya* states, \"*Tuo* means to shed skin.\" It is called *quduo*.\n\n[Note] This refers to transformations within a single form. The *Shiwen* reads: *Qu* is pronounced *qu*. *Duo* is pronounced *dikuo*. *Quduo* is the name of an insect. *Quduo* after a thousand days\n\n[Note] Dies after a thousand days. Transforms into a bird, called *ganyugu*. The foam of *ganyugu* becomes *simi*.\n\n[Note] *Mo* (foam) refers to the essence that arises. The *Shiwen* reads: *Gu* is written as *xu*, and *mo* is pronounced *mo*. The *Nanhua Zhenjing* writes *gu*. Li Yi says, \"*Mo* is the fluid in the mouth.\" *Simi* is the name of an insect. *Simi* becomes *shixi yilü*.\n\nThe *Shiwen* reads: *Xi* is pronounced *xixi*, referring to vinegar gnats, also called *xiji* (vinegar flies), as below. *Yilü* is pronounced *zhilu*. *Shixi yilü* is born from *shixi huanghuang*,\n\nThe *Shiwen* reads: *Huang* is pronounced *kuang*. *Yilü* and *huanghuang* are both insects. *Shixi huanghuang* is born from *jiuyou*.\n\nYu Yue says: The eight characters \"*Yilü shixi huanghuang shixi*\" are superfluous. *Zhuangzi*’s \"Perfect Joy\" chapter reads only, \"*Yilü* is born from *shixi*, *huanghuang* from *jiuyou*,\" omitting these eight. Wang Shumin says: Yu’s claim is incorrect. This passage should be punctuated as \"*Simi wei shixi yilü*\" (a complete clause), \"*Shixi yilü sheng hu shixi huanghuang*\" (another clause), and \"*Shixi huanghuang sheng hu jiuyou*\" (a third clause). The *Taiping Yulan* (887) quotes *Zhuangzi* with the four characters \"*huanghuang shixi*\" still intact above \"*huanghuang sheng hu jiuyou*.\" This should follow the *Liezi* to supplement *Zhuangzi*, rather than using *Zhuangzi*’s corrupted text to delete from the *Liezi*.\n\nThe *Shiwen* reads: Li says, \"*Jiu* should be *jiu* (long-lasting); *jiu* means old. *You* is the name of an insect.\" *Jiuyou* is born from *maorui*.\n\nZhu Junsheng says: *Maorui* is the same as *rui*. *Mao* and *rui* are phonetic alternations. The *Shiwen* reads: *Mao* is pronounced *mao* or *mou*. *Rui* is pronounced *rui*, a small insect fond of swarming in disorder. *Maorui* is born from *fuxuan*.\n\n[Note] These all refer to a single form that revives after death. The *Shiwen* reads: *Fu* is pronounced *fu*. *Xuan* is pronounced *quan* or *huan*, referring to the yellow beetle in melons.\n\nSheep’s liver transforms into *digao*.\n\nBo Jun notes: Liu Rulin once told me that \"*Digao*\" should be \"*digao*\" (earth’s fat), as *gao* (fat) and *xue* (blood) are often paired; thus *digao* is *dixue* (earth’s blood). The *Shuowen* and *Erya Yi* state that *rulü* (madder) grows from human blood, hence its alternate name *dixue*. The *Bencao* records that *qian* root can dye crimson, also called *dixue*. Ancient people, observing that *qian* root could produce red dye, thus believed it arose from animal fat and blood.\n\nHorse blood transforms into *zhuinlin*.\n\nHu Huaichen says: The character \"*zhuan*\" (transform) likely belongs above \"*wei*\" (becomes), reading \"*zhuan wei lin*\" to parallel the earlier \"*hua wei digao*.\"\n\nThe *Shiwen* reads: *Gao* is pronounced *gao*. Gu Yin’s *Hanshu Jijie* states, \"Like stagnant mud *lin*,\" with *lin* written as *lin* or *lin*, all referring to ghost-fire. The *Huainanzi* says blood becomes *lin*. Pronounced *lin*.\n\nHuman blood transforms into *yehuo*.\n\n[Note] These all refer to spontaneous transformations within a single form.\n\nThe sparrow hawk transforms into the goshawk,\n\nThe *Shiwen* reads: *Yao* is pronounced *yao*. *Zhan* is pronounced *zhan*. The goshawk transforms into the cuckoo,\n\nThe *Shiwen* writes \"*bugu*\" and notes: Also written as \"*gu*.\" Lu Ji’s *Maoshi Bird and Beast Gloss* states, \"The goshawk resembles the sparrow hawk, with yellow feathers, a sparrow hawk’s head, and a gray body; it flies swiftly, preying on doves, pigeons, swallows, and sparrows. *Bugu* is *jieju*, also called *shijiu*, *jigu*, or *chengjiu*.\" In mid-spring, sparrows, sparrow hawks, eagles, and goshawks transform into *ju*. *Ju* is pronounced *ju*.\n\nQin Enfu states: \"谷\" and \"毂\" are interchangeable ancient characters; the *Laozi* writes \"不谷\" as \"不毂.\" The *bugu* eventually reverts to the sparrow hawk, and the swallow transforms into the clam. \"燕\" in all editions is written as \"燕.\" Wang Shumin notes: The *Taiping Yulan* (887) cites this passage from the *Zhuangzi*, with \"久\" written as \"之.\" It should follow the *Zhuangzi* and read \"之.\" The *Emperor Huizong’s Exegesis* states, \"Some revert through inherent nature, as when the sparrow hawk becomes the goshawk, the goshawk the *bugu*, and the *bugu* reverts to the sparrow hawk\"—thus the edition he consulted correctly reads \"之.\" The *Shiwen* writes \"燕\" as \"燕\" and notes: *Ge* (clam) is pronounced *he.* The *Kongzi Jiayu* states: In winter, swallows and sparrows enter the sea and transform into clams. \"燕\" may also be written as \"雀.\" The *Book of Zhou* says: Sparrows enter great waters and transform into clams. The field mouse transforms into the quail—its transformation is the same. The *Shuowen* states: The quail is a *ru.* The *Da Dai Liji* says: In the third month, the field mouse transforms into a *ru.* The *Shiwen* notes: *Chun* (quail) is pronounced *chun*, matching the *Book of Zhou*’s account of transforming into a *ru.* Guo’s commentary on the *Erya* states: The *ru* is also a *ru.* *Ru* is pronounced *an.*\n\n\"Ru is pronounced *ru.*\n\nBo Jun notes: The current edition of the *Shuowen* under the *zhui* radical reads '□,' stating, '□ belongs to the *ru* category.' This differs from the edition Jingshun consulted.\n\nRotten melons transform into fish. The *Shiwen* writes '朽' as '□,' noting: □ is pronounced *xiu.*\n\nOld leeks transform into amaranth. The *Shiwen* writes '苋' as '莞,' noting: *Jiu* (leek) is pronounced *ju you.* *Guan* (莞) is pronounced *guan,* resembling cattail but round—what is now used for mats. Yang Chengqing’s *Zitong* reads it as *guan,* while another version writes it as *xian,* pronounced *hou bian*—a transcription error. Ren Dachun states: In Li’s *Commentary on the Book of Changes,* '苋陆夬夬,' Yu Fan says, '苋 means joy. *Xian* is read as in *Confucius’ xian er* (苋尔) when he laughed.' The *Shiwen* on the *Changes* notes: '苋, three schools read it as *qi lian* (期练), one version writes it as *guan.*' The *Shiwen* on the *Analects* notes: '*Xian er* (苋尔) is pronounced *hua ban,* now written as *guan er.*' In the *Chu Ci’s* *Yufu,* '*guan er*' is also written as '*xian er,*' hence *guan* and *xian* are interchangeable. The *Guanzi’s* *Diyuan* chapter states: 'Leaves descend to *□,* which is *yu.* *□* descends to *xian,* and *xian* descends to *pu.*' The *Shanguo Gui* chapter says, 'There are lands of *guan* and *pu.*' The *Da Dai Liji’s* *Quanxue* chapter states, '*Guan* and *pu* grow there.' Thus, *xian* and *guan* are both akin to *pu,* so old leeks become *guan,* and *guan* is also written as *xian.*\n\nOld ewes transform into apes. [Note:] *Yu* (羭) refers to female sheep. The Northern Song edition and the Zang edition write '牝' as '牡,' while the Shidetang edition writes it as '牝.' According to the *Shuowen:* 'In summer, the female sheep is called *yu.*' Duan’s commentary cites Yan Shigu’s note on the *Jijiu Pian:* '*Yu* is the female of summer sheep.' Thus, writing it as '牝' is correct. The *Shiwen* notes: *Yu* is pronounced *yu,* referring to female sheep or black sheep. *Yuan* (ape) is pronounced *yuan.*\n\nFish eggs transform into insects. [Note:] These all transform naturally without external influence. Wang Shumin states: There should be a '也' after '虫' to match the syntax of the preceding text. The *Taiping Yulan* (887) quotes the *Zhuangzi* with the '也' included. The *Shiwen* notes: *Luan* (卵, egg) is pronounced *lai duan.*\n\nThe beasts of Dan-Yuan conceive and bear offspring by themselves, called *lei.* [Note:] *Dan* is pronounced *chan.* The *Shanhaijing* states: 'On Dan-Yuan Mountain, there is a beast resembling a leopard with hair, named *lei,* which reproduces by itself as both male and female.' Lu Wenchang notes: The annotation 'with hair' in the *Shanhaijing* reads '髦.' Ren Dachun states: Guo Pu’s commentary on the *Shanhaijing* notes, '髦 may also be written as *fa.*' Thus, the current edition’s *mao* (髦) written as *fa* (发) follows Guo’s note on the alternate form. The *Shiwen* writes '发' as '髦,' noting: *Dan-Yuan,* the first is *chan,* the second is *yuan.* *Li* (狸) is pronounced *li zhi.* *Mao* (髦) is pronounced *mao,* meaning hanging hair. *Pin* (牝) is pronounced *pi ren.* *Mu* (牡) is pronounced *mou.*\n\nThe birds of rivers and marshes conceive by gazing, called *yi.* [Note:] These conceive by mutual gaze. The *Zhuangzi* states: 'White *yi* gaze at each other, their pupils unmoving, and the wind transforms them.' Bo Jun notes: The annotation cites the *Zhuangzi’s* *Tianyun* chapter. The two characters '之也' are absent in the current edition and were likely added by Zhang Zhan. The *Shiwen* notes: *Yi* (鶂) is pronounced *wu li.* The *Sancang* states: *Cang* (鸧) is *yi.* Sima Biao states: It refers to fledglings. *Mou* (眸) is pronounced *mou.*\n\nPure females are called *da;* pure males are called *zhi* bees. [Note:] *Da* refers to creatures like turtles and soft-shelled turtles. *Zhi* means small. These transform without male or female. The preceding discusses the principles of insects and beasts; the following clarifies that the human Dao also has such cases. Huang Chengji states: '蜂' is interchangeable with '锋.' *Feng* (锋) means edge or momentum. '*Zhi feng*' and '*da*' form a parallel, not the name of an insect. The *Shiwen* notes: *Zhi* is the ancient form of *zhi* (稚). *Feng* (蜂) is pronounced *feng.* Sima Biao states: *Zhi feng* are slender-waisted bees that take mulberry worms, enchant them, and make them resemble their own offspring.\n\nLonging scholars without wives conceive by emotion; longing women without husbands conceive by yearning. [Note:] The *Dahuang Jing* states: 'There is the country of Siyou, where longing scholars have no wives, and longing women have no husbands. Their essence and qi subtly interact, and they bear children without intercourse.' These are akin to the white *yi.* The *Shiwen* notes: *Yun* (孕) is pronounced *yi zheng.*\n\nHou Ji was born from a giant footprint. [Note:] Records state: Gaoxin’s consort, named Jiang Yuan, saw a giant footprint, admired it, and trod upon it. As if moved by a human’s essence, she conceived and bore Hou Ji. Grown and virtuous, he became Yao’s assistant—the ancestor of the Zhou. The *Shiwen* writes '生' as '长,' noting: *Hao* (好) is pronounced *hu bao.* *Zhang* (长) is pronounced *ding zhang.* The annotation is the same.\n\nYi Yin was born from an empty mulberry tree. [Note:] Records state: Yi Yin’s mother lived by the Yi River. After conceiving, she dreamed a spirit told her: 'When mortar water flows out, flee eastward—do not look back!' The next day, she saw mortar water flowing out, told her neighbors, and fled east. After ten *li,* she looked back, and her village was submerged. Her body transformed into an empty mulberry tree. A woman of the Youxin clan, gathering mulberries, found an infant within the hollow mulberry and named him Yi Yin, presenting him to her lord. She ordered a cook to raise him. Grown and virtuous, he became Tang of Yin’s minister.\"\n\nThe annotation \"after ten *li* she looked back\" (*shi li er gu*)—*Wenlei Ju* (前集, juan 44) and Hong Xingzu’s *Supplementary Annotations to the \"Heavenly Questions\" of the Chu Ci* both include the character *shi* (视) after *gu* (顾). Judging by the meaning of the text, the character *shi* should indeed be present. The *Shiwen* notes: *jiu* (臼) is pronounced *jiu.* *Xin* (辛) is pronounced *shu zhen.* *Ying* (婴) is sometimes written as *ying* (缨), which is incorrect. *Xiang* (相) is pronounced *xi liang.*\n\nJue Zhao was born from dampness. [Note:] This refers to birth through steaming moisture. The *Shiwen* states: Jue Zhao—Master Zeng said it is another name for *guli* (孤藜), which constantly flutters around its tree and cannot leave it. The master’s explanation says *guli* is the *qingling* insect. *Qingling* (蜻蛉) is *qing ling.* *Shi* (湿) is pronounced *shi ru.* *Zheng* (蒸) is pronounced *zheng.*\n\nXijī was born from wine. [Note:] This refers to birth through sour qi. The *Shiwen* states: *Xijī* (酰鸡) is the *miemeng* (蠛蠓) insect. *Yangxi* (羊奚) compared to the non-sprouting [plant]. [Note:] This refers to different kinds forming an intimate bond. The *Shide Tang* edition writes *sun* (笋) as *xun* (荀). Qin Enfu said: *Zhuangzi* writes it as *□*, which should be read together with the following sentence. The *Shiwen* states: *bi* (比) is pronounced *pi.* *Sun* (笋) is pronounced *sun.*\n\nLong bamboo gives birth to *qingning*. [Note:] This arises from forests and marshes. Wang Shumin states: *Taiping Yulan* 887 cites *Zhuangzi* with the repeated phrase \"not sprouting long bamboo.\" The sentence should read: \"Yangxi compared to the non-sprouting long bamboo,\" followed by \"non-sprouting long bamboo gives birth to *qingning*,\" making the structure perfectly clear. Here, above \"gives birth to *qingning*,\" the four characters \"non-sprouting long bamboo\" are likely also omitted. *Shiwen* notes: *Nanhua Zhenjing* connects \"from Yangxi to *qingning*\" as a single sentence. Sima Biao says: Yangxi is the name of a plant, its root resembling turnip; it bonds with long bamboo, both arising from unlike kinds. *Qingning* is the name of an insect.\n\n*Qingning* gives birth to *cheng*. [Note:] From *qing* to *cheng*, all are living things—birds, beasts, insects, and animals—speaking of their ceaseless transformation: some change in form, some die and are reborn, beginning and end following one another without end. *Shiwen* states: *Shizi* says *cheng* is called *leopard* in the Central States and *mo* by the Yue people. According to the *Erya*, bears and tigers are of the same kind, their offspring being leopards. Leopards are the young of bears and tigers. *Shanhaijing* says: Southern mountains abound in *mo* and leopards. Guo’s commentary states: *Mo* is the white variant of leopards; leopards are born of unlike tigers. Thus, *cheng* is another name for *mo*. *Mo* resembles a bear, its fur yellow-black and lustrous. *Mo* is pronounced *mo*. Bo Jun notes: *Erya*’s *Shi Shou* reads: \"Bears and tigers are of the same kind, their offspring being dogs.\" Jing Shun’s citation reads \"their offspring being leopards,\" though the reason is unclear.\n\n*Cheng* gives birth to horses. Shen Kuo says: I have examined textual annotations where \"the Qin people call leopards *cheng*.\" When I arrived in Yanzhou, people still referred to tigers and leopards as *cheng*, likely meaning \"creature.\" Such is the local dialect, perhaps an old custom. Horses give birth to humans. Jiang Chaobo says: These are likely all alternative names for plants and trees, like *heiema* and *mafu*.\n\nHumans, after long, enter the *mechanism*. Wang Shumin says: *Zhuangzi* writes \"long\" as \"again,\" which should be followed. \"Long\" is a miswriting of \"again,\" their forms being easily confused. The following line, \"advancing to the root not long,\" also miswrites \"long\" for \"again.\" The myriad things all emerge from the *mechanism*, all enter the *mechanism*. [Note:] How can the transformations of life and death be fathomed? That which is born here may die there; that which dies there may be born here. Yet the life of forms never ceases for even a moment. Thus, the sage knows life is not eternally preserved, nor death everlasting extinction. The transformations of a single *qi* take ten thousand forms. Though the ten thousand forms undergo ten thousand changes, that which does not change abides in the unchanging—this is called the *mechanism*. The *mechanism* is the origin of all beings, the source of all movement. Thus, from nonbeing it emerges into being, from being it scatters into nonbeing—nothing does not proceed from it.\n\n[Commentary:] Of the kinds of seeds. Does the kind have a category? Or do they mutually give birth? This question is posed to clarify that where the spirit goes, there is life; where the spirit departs, there is death. Forms have no constant master, spirits no fixed form. The spirit has no fixed term, while forms congeal. Once receiving the substance of form, it is as if bound by the *mechanism*: birth is emergence, death is entry. In the note, \"the life of forms\" appears as \"the master of forms\" in the *Sijie* and *Shide Tang* editions. In the commentary, \"posing this question,\" the Qin engraving writes \"kill\" for \"pose,\" here corrected following the *Sijie* edition. Lu Wenchang says: In the note, below \"death is not everlasting extinction,\" the *Zang* edition includes the character \"而.\" The note’s end lacks the character \"也.\" Wang Lai says: In Lu’s commentary, \"of the kinds of seeds,\" above \"seeds\" the character \"几\" should be added.\n\nThe *Book of the Yellow Emperor* states: \"When form moves, it does not give birth to form but to shadow; when sound moves, it does not give birth to sound but to echo.\" [Note:] Where there is form, there must be shadow; where there is sound, there must be echo. These arise naturally and coexist, emerging and vanishing together—how could there be any sequence of dependence or priority? Guo Xiang’s commentary on *Zhuangzi* discusses this in detail. Yet worldly speakers claim that when form moves, shadow follows; when sound issues, echo responds. The sage takes this as a metaphor, clarifying that when things move, they lose their root; when still, they return to it—no longer adhering to the principle of mutual resonance.\n\n[Note:] That being arises from nonbeing relies on nonbeing for its birth. To speak of birth is necessarily through nonbeing, and nonbeing gives birth to being without exception. This function of circulation depends entirely on nonbeing. Thus, the term \"giving birth through movement\" is established in accordance with circumstances.\n\n[Commentary:] Forms, having something from which they are born, cannot give birth to nonbeing—shadows and echoes are examples. The spirit, being formless, when moved gives birth to being—all things are examples. Lu Wenchang says: In the note, below \"and nonbeing gives birth to being without exception,\" the character \"于\" should be added. Bo Jun notes: Lu’s suggestion is unreliable. This states that being is not born of nonbeing, but rather arises from nonbeing. The meaning is perfectly clear; adding \"于\" would obscure it.\n\n[Note:] Form is that which must end. Do heaven and earth end? They end together with me. [Note:] Measuring great and small, calculating long and short, they differ from me. Yet in converging upon an end, the principle is fundamentally the same.\n\n[Commentary:] Though great and small differ, they share the same fate of ending.\n\nThe *Shiwen* notes: \"偕 is read as *jie*. 料 is read as *liao*. Does it advance to an end? One does not know.\"\n\n[Note:] \"Advance\" should be \"end.\" In this text, the character \"尽\" (*end*) is often written as \"进\" (*advance*). When things gather, they form shape; when they scatter, they come to an end—this is what the world calls \"end and beginning.\" Yet when things gather, their beginning lies in solid form, and their end in dispersion; when they scatter, their beginning lies in emptiness, and their end in solid form. Thus they alternately serve as each other’s end and beginning, yet in principle there is truly neither end nor beginning.\n\n[Commentary:] \"Advance\" should be \"end.\" This is a hypothetical question: Does heaven and earth have an end? Or is it unknown? The answer follows. Tao Hongqing says: The two characters \"不知\" (*one does not know*) are meaningless, and the note does not address them—it is likely that \"知\" (*know*) is a corruption of \"始\" (*beginning*). The *Zhuangzi*’s *Lie Yukou* chapter states: \"Return the spirit to the beginningless, and delight in the realm of nothing-whatsoever.\" \"Ending in non-beginning\" is precisely \"returning the spirit to the beginningless.\" Zhang’s note says: \"They alternately serve as each other’s end and beginning, yet in principle there is truly neither end nor beginning.\" Presumably, the text he saw originally read \"不始\" (*non-beginning*). This continues the above: \"I am of the same body as heaven and earth; heaven and earth end together with me. Yet ending is ceasing in non-beginning—if there has never been a beginning, then there has never been an end either.\" Below it states: \"The Dao ends in fundamental non-beginning, advances in fundamental non-being,\" which further elaborates this meaning. Wu Kaisheng parses \"终进乎不知也\" as a single phrase, saying: \"It ends and advances into the unknowable reckoning of reckonings.\" Bo Jun notes: Wu’s interpretation does not accord with the context.\n\nThe *Shiwen* notes: \"进 is read as *jin*, the same below. 漠 is read as *mo*. 迭 is read as *die*.\"\n\nThe Dao ends in fundamental non-beginning, advances in fundamental non-duration.\n\n[Note:] \"久\" (*duration*) should be \"有\" (*being*). Without beginning, there is no end; without being, there is no exhaustion. The Lu Chongxuan edition omits the character \"本\" (*fundamental*) below \"进乎.\" Wang Shumin says: The note \"久 should be 有\" is correct. \"久\" is likely a graphic corruption of \"又,\" as \"又\" was often used for \"有\" in antiquity.\n\nThe *Shiwen* notes: \"久 is read as *you*.\"\n\nThat which has birth returns to non-birth; that which has form returns to formlessness.\n\n[Note:] The born revert to death; the formed revert to emptiness—this is the natural reckoning.\n\n[Commentary:] All things with beginning and end are fundamentally without beginning and return to non-being. Now, speaking from the primordial undifferentiated state, this is having a beginning—how could it not end? How could it not be exhausted? \"That which does not give birth\"—\n\n[Note:] This \"does not give birth\" first had birth, then proceeded to death and extinction.\n\n—is not fundamentally unborn.\n\n[Note:] That which is fundamentally unborn originally had neither birth nor extinction.\n\n\"That which is without form\"—\n\n[Note:] This \"without form\" also first had form, then proceeded to dispersion.\n\n—is not fundamentally formless.\n\n[Note:] That which is fundamentally formless originally had neither gathering nor scattering.\n\nNow, that which gives birth to beings is itself unborn; that which gives form to things is itself formless. Thus it can give form to the myriad things, yet my body undergoes no change. To say that what is already born and formed then reverts to non-birth and formlessness is merely the alternation of existence and extinction—it is not the unchanging principle of beginning and end.\n\n[Commentary:] What is meant by the spirit’s non-birth is not that it was never born. The birth of the myriad things and the formation of all species are all set in motion by the spirit. Because it can give birth to life, its essence is without birth or extinction. This is not the same as the complete absence of form and birth, identical to the qi of the Great Void.\n\nThe *Shiwen* notes: \"而复之复 is read as *fu*.\"\n\nThe born are those whose principle must end. The ending cannot but end, just as the born cannot but be born.\n\n[Note:] The born do not give birth yet are spontaneously born—thus though born, they do not know how they are born. Not knowing how they are born, birth cannot be severed; not knowing how they die, death cannot be warded off. Yet to desire to perpetuate their life and delimit their end is to be deluded by reckoning.\n\n[Note:] \"画\" means *to cease*.\n\n[Commentary:] Things that have birth must have an end, just as when harmonious qi sprouts, plants and trees cannot but grow. Yet to desire that they live forever is to be deluded by the supreme reckoning. Lu Wenchang says: The Zhang edition has \"尽\" (*cease*) for \"画,\" with the note: \"尽 means *to cease*.\" Yu Yue says: \"画\" means *to stop*. In the *Analects*, *Yongye* chapter, \"今女画\" (*now you stop*), Kong’s note says: \"画 means *to stop*.\" \"画其终\" (*delimit its end*) means to stop it from ending. Above it states: \"The born are those whose principle must end\"—thus birth fundamentally cannot be made eternal, and ending fundamentally cannot be stopped. Yet to desire to \"perpetuate their life and delimit their end\"—this is why it is called delusion. Zhang’s note says: \"画 means *to cease*,\" but it likely originally read \"画止也\" (*to stop and cease*), then became corrupted due to graphic similarity. The *Lüshi Chunqiu*’s *Benwei* chapter states: \"The Dao ceases that to rectify the self,\" but today it is mistakenly written as \"止彼在己\" (*stops that to be in the self*), which can serve as mutual proof. Yin Jingshun’s *Shiwen* says: \"画 is also written as 尽,\" but this is a character error. In *Qunshu Shibu*, Lu Wenchang says: \"The Zhang edition has 尽, with the note: 尽 means *to cease*,\" but this is incorrect.\n\nBo Jun notes: Yu’s interpretation is correct. The Zang edition, Northern Song edition, and Lu Chongxuan edition have \"尽,\" but we now follow the Shidetang edition and emend it.\n\nThe *Shiwen* notes: \"画 is read as *huai*, *strategy*.\"\n\nOne version reads *jin*, but this does not enhance the meaning.\n\n\"Spirit and essence are Heaven’s *you*;\"\nThe *Shiwen* writes *fen* as *jiu*, noting: \"*Jiu* is read as *you*; the same below.\" Originally written in seal script, it resembled the character *jiu*. According to the *Hanshu*, Yang Wangsun said: \"Spirit and essence are Heaven’s *you*; bones and frame are Earth’s *you*.\" Wangsun frequently read this text, and the present edition of the Directorate of Education writes *fen*. Ren Dachun said: \"Modern editions sometimes write *fen*, which is the Directorate of Education edition referred to in the *Shiwen*.\" Examining the *Huainanzi*’s *Jingshen Xun*: \"Thus spirit and essence are Heaven’s *you*, while bones and frame are Earth’s *you*.\" Again, in \"Huozi held to Heaven and Earth,\" Gao You’s commentary states: \"Spirit and essence are Heaven’s *you*; form and frame are Earth’s *you*,\" all following this passage in the *Liezi*. Thus, the versions seen by Han scholars all wrote *you*, not *fen*. Jingshun’s *Shiwen* states that *jiu* should be *you*, which can still be verified in ancient editions. Sun Yirang said: The *Shiwen*’s claim that \"*jiu* should be *you*\" is correct. However, the seal script of *you* does not closely resemble *jiu*. I suspect that the alternate edition consulted by Yin wrote *you* as *you* (又), whose seal form (□) resembles that of *jiu* (□). *You* (又) and *you* (有) were interchangeable in antiquity, so Yin directly identified it as *you*.\n\n\"Bones and frame are Earth’s *fen*.\"\nThat which belongs to Heaven is clear and disperses; that which belongs to Earth is turbid and congeals. When spirit and essence depart from form, each returns to its true origin.\n[Note] That which is Heaven’s *fen* returns to Heaven; that which is Earth’s *fen* returns to Earth, each reverting to its root. Thus it is called *gui*.\n*Gui* means *to return*, to return to its true dwelling.\n[Note] The true dwelling is the realm of the Great Void.\n[Exegesis] When spirit and numinosity depart from form, it is called death. Returning to the true dwelling is reverting to the Great Clarity. Taking the Great Clarity as the true dwelling clarifies that this form and frame are but empty illusion.\n\nWang Chongmin said: Below the second *gui*, the original text included the word *zhe* (者), which is now omitted in modern editions. The *Han Shi Waizhuan* states: \"The dead become *gui*. *Gui* means *to return*.\" The *Lunheng*’s *Lunsi* chapter says: \"When a person dies, their spirit ascends to Heaven, and their bones return to Earth, hence they are called *gui*. *Gui* means *to return*.\" The *Fengsu Tong* states: \"Death is *si* (澌); *gui* means *to return*. Spirit and essence dissipate, while flesh and bones return to the earth.\" In all these cases, *gui* is followed by *zhe*, which confirms this. The *Yilin* quotes the correct text as: \"*Gui zhe* means *to return*.\"\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said: \"When spirit and essence enter its gate, and bones and frame return to their root, what remains of me?\"\n[Note] What life lacks form, what form lacks *qi*, what *qi* lacks numinosity? Thus, mind, wisdom, form, and frame are but one body of yin and yang, a partial accumulation of a single *qi*. When they depart from form and return to their root, they revert to their true dwelling, and \"I\" cease to be anything at all.\n[Exegesis] Ordinary people take form as \"I,\" and from \"I\" arise emotions. Those with many emotions are deeply mired in attachment, while those with few desires have thinner cravings. Only the perfected person is without \"I,\" fully comprehending their spirit. Ordinary people, unaware, cling ever more stubbornly.\n\nWhen the spirit returns to the true, and the form returns to the earth, where then does the former \"I\" reside?\n\n[Bo Jun’s note] *Gen* (\"root\") and *cun* (\"abide\") rhyme, both belonging to the ancient *wen* rhyme group.\n\nAnother interpretation: *Feng zhi* (\"stubborn attachment\") should be *feng zhi* (\"nurtured growth\"), as seen in *Zuozhuan* (Duke Zhao, Year 2).\n\nFrom birth to death, the great transformation encompasses four stages:\n[Note] Within these transitions, there is no moment of pause—these four are but a broad outline.\n\n[Exegesis] The infant, in whom right and wrong have yet to arise in the heart, possesses deep virtue and single-minded focus. When desires and thoughts flourish, they invite many assaults. In old age, *qi* softens, drawing nearer to the Dao. At life’s final limit, one comes to rest.\n\n[Lu Wenchong’s note] The annotation \"no moment of pause\" in the *Zang* edition reads the same below.\n\n[Bo Jun’s note] The original text does not separate paragraphs; this division follows the meaning.\n\nThe *Shiwen* reads *ben jiao* (\"fundamental outline\") as *da jiao* (\"broad outline\"), noting: *Jiao* is pronounced *jue*.\n\nThe four stages are: infancy, youth and prime, old age, and death.\n\nIn infancy, *qi* is focused and the will undivided—harmony at its peak. Nothing harms it, and no virtue surpasses it.\n[Note] *Laozi* says, \"One whose virtue is deeply stored is like a newborn child.\"\n\nIn youth and prime, blood and *qi* surge and overflow, while desires and thoughts flourish. External things assail it, and virtue thus declines.\n\nAt the stage of youth and prime, one dwells in the realm of striving and contention—where external things do not align.\n[Note] *Shiwen* reads *gu* (\"thus\") as *yin* (\"correct\"), noting: *Yin* means \"upright.\" Another version reads *gu*.\n\nIn old age, desires and thoughts soften; the body prepares for rest, and nothing takes precedence.\n[Note] *Xiu* means \"to cease.\" Without a heart of competition, external things do not contend with it.\n[Note] *Shiwen* notes: *Zheng* is pronounced *zheng*.\n\nThough not as complete as infancy, it surpasses youth and prime.\n[Bo Jun’s note] *Jian* means \"rest\" or \"peace,\" as seen in the *Guoyu*’s *Jin Yu* annotation and the *Chu Ci*’s *Zhao Hun* annotation. It describes how, in old age, one attains tranquility compared to the surging *qi*, flourishing desires, and restless thoughts of youth and prime. Some say it should be read as *jian* in the *Lunyu*’s *Zi Han* chapter (\"when the illness abates\"), meaning \"separation.\"\n[Note] *Shiwen* notes: *Jian* is pronounced *jian*, meaning \"to divide.\"\n\nAt death, one comes to rest, returning to the ultimate limit.\n[Exegesis] Nearness to nature aligns one with the Dao, while delusion by emotion severs authenticity. Thus, one whose virtue is deeply stored is like a newborn child. Even weariness without action remains secondary—far superior to the reckless striving of the world.\n\nConfucius wandered on Mount Tai—*Shiwen* notes *Tai* is written as *Da* (大), pronounced *Tai* (泰). He encountered Rong Qiqi walking in the wilds of Cheng—*Bo Jun* notes: The *Huainanzi*’s *Zhushu Xun* states, \"Rong Qiqi played a single tune, and Confucius rejoiced for three days, moved by its harmony,\" likely referring to this same Rong Qiqi. *Shiwen* notes: *Cheng* is pronounced *Cheng* (成), the name of a fief in Lu. *Bo Jun* notes: *Cheng* is also written as *Cheng* (成), originally a state name; King Wu of Zhou enfeoffed his younger brother Shu Wu there. By the Spring and Autumn period, it belonged to Lu as a fief of the Meng clan. It lies ninety *li* northeast of present-day Ningyang County in the Tai’an region of Shandong.\n\nClad in a deerskin robe and girded with a hempen rope—Shen Tao remarks: A *deerskin robe* refers to a coarse fur garment, not one made of deer; a *deer cart* denotes a simple cart, not one drawn by deer. The character for \"coarse\" (粗) contains three \"deer\" (鹿), hence *lu* carries the sense of coarseness. The *Lüshi Chunqiu*’s *Guisheng Pian* speaks of Yan He wearing a *deer-cloth robe*, meaning a garment of rough cloth. *Bo Jun* notes: The *Hanfeizi*’s *Wudu Pian* states, \"In winter, a deerskin robe; in summer, ramie clothing—even the attire of a gatekeeper’s servant does not fall below this\" (the original text reads *ni* (麑) for *deer*, but this is corrected following the *Li Si Zhuan* and the *Taiping Yulan*’s citations in chapters 27, 80, and 694). The *Records of the Grand Historian*’s *Autobiographical Afterword* says, \"In summer, ramie clothing; in winter, a deerskin robe.\" The *Huainanzi*’s *Jingshen Xun* states, \"Embroidered silks and fox-fur robes are what people desire, yet Yao concealed his form in plain cloth and wore a deerskin robe against the cold\"—thus, a deerskin robe was winter’s humble garb. *Shiwen* notes: *Suo* (索) is pronounced *sùo* (先各切).\n\nHe strummed his zither and sang.\n\nConfucius asked, \"Master, what is the reason for your joy?\"\n\n*Wang Chongmin* notes: The *Taiping Yulan* (468) cites \"以\" as \"为,\" while the *Yiwen Leiju* (44) renders it \"先生为乐何也,\" with \"以\" likewise as \"为.\" *Shiwen* reads \"以乐\" as \"为乐,\" stating: *Le* is pronounced *luò* (洛), and the same applies below.\n\nHe replied, \"My joys are many. Heaven generates the myriad things, yet only humans are noble—this is my first joy. That I have attained human form is one joy.\n\n**[Note]**: Extending this reasoning, it becomes clear that the *qi* and spirit of humans differ not from those of other beings; only their destinies diverge, hence their forms vary. Thus, Rong Qiqi deeply probed the hidden causes of fortune and misfortune, penetrating the workings of the unseen and manifest. Therefore, he rejoiced in surpassing the forms of others and in attaining the esteemed male form—how could this be mere reckless speech?\n\n*Bo Jun* notes: The *Taiping Yulan* (468) reads \"吾既得为人,\" aligning with the syntax of the following phrases, \"吾既得为男\" and \"吾既己行年九十.\" The *Shuo Yuan*’s *Za Yan* chapter has \"吾既己得为人,\" while the *Kongzi Jiayu* (6) reads \"吾既得为人.\" It is likely that the *Kongzi Jiayu* preserves the correct version.\n\nAs for the distinction between male and female, *Shiwen* notes: *Bie* (别) is pronounced *bǐe liè* (彼列切). Since men are honored and women humbled, the male form is esteemed. That I have attained the male form is my second joy.\n\n**[Note]**: Before birth, whether one becomes male or female is not predetermined, hence the additional joy of attaining a male body.\n\n*Shiwen* notes: *Fen* (分) is pronounced *fú wèn* (扶问切); *fù* (复) is pronounced *fú yòu* (扶又切).\n\nThere are those who do not live to see the sun and moon, who never leave swaddling clothes. *Shiwen* reads \"襁褓\" as \"襁保,\" stating: *Qiǎng* (襁) is pronounced *jū liǎng* (居两切); some versions write it as *qiǎng* (襁). *Bǎo* (褓): The *Bowuzhi* states it is woven from threads, eight *cun* wide and one *chi* two *cun* long, used to secure infants on the back.\n\nThat I have already lived ninety years is my third joy.\n\n*Wang Chongmin* notes: The *Yiwen Leiju* (44) reads \"吾年九十有五矣,\" suggesting that the present *Liezi* text omits \"有五\" after \"九十.\" The *Shuo Yuan*’s *Za Yan* chapter and the *Taiping Yulan* (509), citing the *Shengxian Gaoshi Zhuan*, both read \"九十有五.\" The *Gaoshi Zhuan* likely relied on an older version of the *Liezi*, confirming that \"有五\" originally followed \"九十.\"\n\n*Bo Jun* notes: There are two *Gaoshi Zhuan*: one by Huangfu Mi, whose *Shiquan Lun* in the *Jin Shu*’s *Huangfu Mi Zhuan* states, \"Rong Qiqi’s three joys moved Confucius,\" referring to this passage. The other, by Xi Kang, titled *Shengxian Gaoshi Zhuan*, also includes this figure, as cited in the *Taiping Yulan* (509). The *Yiwen Leiju* (36), citing Sun Chu’s *Rong Qiqi Zan*, draws from pre-Qin and Han texts, not the *Liezi*. Tao Qian’s *Drinking Wine* poem, \"At ninety, he girds himself with rope,\" references this passage, showing that some versions read simply \"九十.\"\n\nPoverty is the constant lot of the scholar; death is the end of all humans.\n\n*Bo Jun* notes: The *Taiping Yulan* (468) reads, \"贫者人之常，死者命之终.\" The *Yiwen Leiju* (44) has, \"贫者士之常，死者生之终.\"\n\nAbiding in this constant and accepting life’s end—\n\n*Lu Wenchang* notes: \"得\" in the *Shuo Yuan*’s *Za Yan* chapter is written as \"待.\"\n\n*Wang Chongmin* notes: \"待\" is correct. Rong Qiqi, content with Heaven’s decree and understanding fate, recognized that poverty is the scholar’s norm and death the end of all humans. Thus, he declared himself at ease with the constant, awaiting life’s end—what cause for sorrow? If written as \"得,\" it would miss the point.\n\nThe *Taiping Yulan* (468) indeed reads \"待.\" The *Yiwen Leiju* (44) has \"居常以待终,\" with minor variations but the same meaning, and the \"待\" is unmistakably correct.\n\n*Bo Jun* notes: Lu and Wang are correct. The following chapter’s Zhang Zhan commentary states, \"Content with Heaven’s decree and understanding fate, he awaited life’s end with equanimity.\" The phrase \"待终\" clearly echoes this passage, showing that Zhang’s version still read \"待.\"\n\n—what cause for sorrow is there?\"\n\n*Bo Jun* notes: \"当\" should be read as \"尚.\" The *Records of the Grand Historian*’s *Wei Gongzi Liezhuan* states, \"If Qin destroys Daliang and razes the ancestral temples of our former kings, with what face could you stand in the world?\" Here, \"当\" should likewise be read as \"尚,\" providing mutual confirmation.\n\nConfucius said, \"Excellent! He is one who can console himself.\"\n\n**[Note]**: Unable to entirely forget joy and sorrow, Confucius praised his ability to reason and find self-consolation.\n\n**[Explanation]**: Just as a great smith casts metal, shaping it to the mold, so too does the spirit form its vessel, giving rise to all shapes. The length of life for men and women is predetermined by yin and yang. Why? The spirit enacts its work, and the form repays it in kind. Since the form cannot comprehend itself, the spirit, though formless, already knows. Qiqi only began to rejoice in his later years, for he came to the Dao late. His emotions remained bound to form, so Confucius merely praised his self-consolation, not his profound grasp of the ultimate Dao.\n\nLin Lei was nearly a hundred years old.\n\n**[Note]**: No records of him exist in transmitted texts; he was likely an ancient recluse.\n\n*Bo Jun* notes: \"且\" means \"将.\" *Shiwen* notes: *Lèi* (类) is pronounced *lèi* (泪); versions writing it as *yǐng* (颍) are mistakenly conflating it with another character.\n\nIn late spring, he wore a fur robe.\n\n**[Note]**: \"底\" means \"当.\" The final \"也\" is added following the *Sijie* edition.\n\n*Bo Jun* notes: The *Shuowen* states: *Qiú* (裘) is a fur garment, with a variant *qiú* (求). *Qiú* (求) depicts the shape of a fur robe, likely the original character. All fur garments are called *qiú*, without distinction of quality. Later writers sometimes used it to denote fine attire, as in the *Lüshi Chunqiu*’s \"In early winter, the Son of Heaven first dons fur robes,\" the *Huainanzi*’s *Fanlun Xun*’s \"The world considers fur robes rare and precious,\" and the *Gongyang Zhuan*’s *Huan 8* commentary, \"Fur and linen are the finest garments for warding off cold and heat.\" These are examples of such usage.\n\nMoreover, it can also serve as attire for the impoverished, as in the *Zhuangzi*’s *Tianxia* chapter: \"Causing later Mohists to wear coarse fur and hemp garments and don straw sandals as their attire.\" Cheng Xuanying’s commentary explains: \"Fur and hemp are rough clothing.\" The *Xinshu*’s *Zashi* chapter five states: \"Formerly, Master Chuqiu, at seventy years of age, wore a fur robe tied with a rope and went to see Lord Mengchang.\" This passage’s \"in late spring, he wore a fur robe\" is another such example.\n\nThe *Shiwen* notes: *Dǐ* is pronounced *dǔ lǐ*; *bèi* is read as *bèi*.\n\nGleaning forgotten grain from the old fields—\n**[Note]**: After the harvest, gathering the abandoned grain from the fields.\nThe *Shiwen* notes: *Suì* is pronounced *suì*; *qí* is read as *xié*; *jùn* is pronounced *jū yùn*.\n\nSinging as they walked side by side.\n**Bo Jun** notes: \"Singing as they walked side by side\" means singing while advancing.\nThe *Shiwen* notes: *Bìng* is pronounced *páng làng*; the same below. It means walking alongside the fields.\n\nConfucius traveled to Wei and saw him in the countryside. Turning to his disciples, he said: \"That old man may be someone worth speaking to. Try going to question him!\"\nThe *Shiwen* notes: *Sǒu* is pronounced *xī kǒu*. One version reads \"There is—try going to question him,\" with *xùn* pronounced *xìn*; another omits the word \"there.\"\n\nZigong requested to go. Meeting him at the end of the ridge,\nThe *Shiwen* notes: *Lǒng* is pronounced *lì zhǒng*.\n\nHe faced him and sighed, saying: \"Sir, have you no regrets, singing and gleaning grain as you go?\"\nLin Lei did not pause in his steps nor cease his song.\nThe *Shiwen* notes: *Chuò* is pronounced *dīng liè*, meaning \"to stop.\"\n\nZigong pressed him repeatedly,\nThe *Shiwen* notes: *Kòu* is pronounced *qiū hòu*.\n\nUntil he looked up and replied: \"What should I regret?\"\nZigong said: \"In your youth, you did not strive in conduct;\nThe *Shiwen* notes: *Shào* is pronounced *shī zhào*; *xíng* is read as *xià mèng*, the same below.\n\nIn your prime, you did not compete with the times;\nThe *Shiwen* notes: *Zhǎng* is pronounced *dīng zhàng*, the same below.\n\nNow in old age, you have no wife or children, and death approaches—what joy is there in gleaning grain and singing as you go?\"\nThe *Shiwen* notes: *Lè* is pronounced *luò*.\n\nLin Lei laughed and said: \"The reason I find joy is something everyone possesses, yet they turn it into sorrow.\n**[Note]**: What I find joy in is shared by all, but they fail to remain equanimous in the face of events, so they never experience fleeting happiness.\n**[Explanation]**: The benevolent know no sorrow; the wise know no fear. They are not bound by form. Life is allotted to me—why should the gentleman grieve over poverty and low status or rush after wealth and nobility? Those who do not understand this turn it into sorrow—why be surprised at me?\n\nIn youth, I did not strive in conduct; in my prime, I did not compete with the times—thus I have attained such longevity.\n**[Note]**: Not striving in conduct means forsaking fame and reputation; not competing with the times means abandoning profit and desire. With neither in one’s heart, a lifespan of a hundred years is not sought but naturally attained.\n**[Explanation]**: Striving in improper conduct and competing for time beyond fate—seeking what cannot be grasped—harms life and shortens years. My joy lies in understanding Heaven and knowing fate, thus attaining this longevity.\n**Wang Lai** says: In Lu’s explanation, \"seeking what cannot be grasped\" (*qiú zhī bù bá*), *bá* should be *huò*.\nThe *Shiwen* notes: *Shòu* is pronounced *shòu*.\n\nIn old age, I have no wife or children, and death approaches—thus I find such joy.\n**[Note]**: This is what is meant by understanding Heaven and knowing fate, hence no sorrow.\n**[Explanation]**: Wife and children are enough to weary the mind and trouble the heart—how could they extend one’s lifespan? Living in constant expectation of death, with no sorrow or grief, is why I find such joy.\n\nZigong said: \"Longevity is what people desire; death is what they detest.\n**Bo Jun** notes: The *Hanshu*’s *Biography of Dong Zhongshu* states: \"Desire is what people feel.\" It also says: \"What people feel is called desire.\" The *Hou Hanshu*’s *Biography of Zhang Heng* commentary states: \"Desire is what the nature feels.\" The ancients often paired desire and aversion in parallel, as in the *Lüshi Chunqiu*’s *Lun Wei* chapter: \"People desire life and detest death.\" Thus, *qíng* here should be glossed as *desire*.\nThe *Shiwen* notes: *È* is pronounced *wū lù*.\n\nWhy do you find joy in death?\"\nLin Lei said: \"Death and life are but departure and return. Thus, one who dies here—how do we know they are not born there? **Liang Zhangju** says: The theory of transmigration likely originates here. Therefore, I know they are not unequal.\n**Yu Yue** says: The word *ān* (\"how\") is missing after *wú* (\"I\"). Above, it says \"death and life are but departure and return,\" so it should read \"how do I know they are not equal,\" meaning death and life are one. Below, it says \"how do I know that busily seeking life is not delusion?\"—this directly follows. If it read \"I know they are not equal,\" it would contradict the meaning entirely. Later scribes, seeing two instances of *ān zhī* (\"how do I know\") ending with *hū* (\"?\"), and this one ending with *yǐ* (\"!\"), thought it inconsistent and rashly deleted *ān*. They did not realize *yǐ* functions like *hū*—the difference is merely one of emphasis. Ancient texts often use *yǐ* in place of *hū*; for details, see Wang’s *Jingzhuan Shici*.\n**Wu Kaisheng** argues that *gù* should be read as *gù* (\"certainly\"), meaning \"I certainly know,\" which contradicts Yu’s interpretation. Yu’s view is preferable.\n\nHow do I know that busily seeking life is not delusion? How do I know that my death now is not better than my past life?\"\n**[Note]**: Following this principle, existence and nonexistence alternate endlessly.\n**[Explanation]**: Knowing that form undergoes transformation while spirit knows no death or life—departure and return are like morning and evening. Why busily cling to this and fear that?\n**Wang Shumin** says: After \"seeking life,\" the word *zhī* (\"it\") should be added.\n\nThe *Wen Xuan* annotation to Bao Mingyuan’s *Poem on Taking Medicine at the City’s Eastern Bridge* indeed includes the word *zhi*. The *Shiwen* notes: *yu* is pronounced *yǔ*.\n\nZigong heard this and did not grasp its meaning. He returned and reported it to the Master. The *Shiwen* notes: *gao* (\"reported\") is read as *gǔwò*; the same applies below.\n\nThe Master said: \"I knew he could be spoken with—sure enough. Yet what he attained was not yet complete.\"\n**[Note]**: Hearing Lin Lei’s words so abruptly, Zigong believed he had reached the utmost. Yet the Master declared it still incomplete. \"Complete\" means nothing is left unexhausted, nor is anything exhausted—only then is principle wholly fulfilled. Now, when one opposes nonbeing to being, relinquishes that to grasp this, one cannot but sense the difference between inner and outer. Yet what remains incomplete is but a trifling part. As for the myriad transformations returning to the Mysterious One, where self and other are both forgotten, principle naturally levels itself, and in truth nothing is cast aside. When inner and outer merge in darkness and wander freely, becoming one with the multitude—how could there be completeness or incompleteness?\n\n**[Explanation]**: To die here and live there is the inevitable principle. What Lin Lei called \"how do I know\" is merely ambiguous speech, hence the Master said it was not yet complete. In the note, \"darkly within, freely without\" (*ming nei you wai*), the Northern Song edition reads *you* (\"freely\") as *ni* (\"contrary\"); Wang’s edition follows this error. Here, it is corrected according to the *Daozang* and *Shidetang* editions. The *Shiwen* notes: *cu* (\"abruptly\") is read *cāngmò*; *zao* (\"attained\") is read *qīdào*; *qu* (\"relinquishes\") is read *qiūlǚ*; *chu* (\"part\") is read *chāngjù*.\n\nZigong, weary of study, said to Confucius: \"I wish to rest for a while.\"\n**[Note]**: Study is the means to recover one’s original nature, yet when one grows weary of it, the principle of spontaneity is impaired. The *Jinxiu Wanhua Gu* (Qianji 20) and *He Bi Shi Lei* (Qianji 43) read: \"reported to Confucius, saying.\" The *Shiwen* notes: *yan* (\"weary\") is read *yùyàn*.\n\nConfucius said: \"In life, there is no rest.\"\n**[Note]**: Exerting the mind and taxing the limbs—these are the affairs of the living. Zhuangzi said: \"Life is corvée labor.\"\n\nZigong said: \"Then does that mean I have no place to rest?\"\nWang Shumin says: \"Rest nowhere\" (*xi wu suo*) likely originally read \"nowhere to rest\" (*wu suo xi*), following the above phrase \"no rest in life.\" In the present edition, the word *xi* (\"rest\") is mistakenly transposed above \"nowhere.\"\n\nBo Jun notes: Judging from the reply below, \"rest nowhere\" is not in error.\n\nConfucius said: \"There is, of course. Look to the grave mounds—\nThe *Shiwen* notes: *kuàng* is read *kuàng*; it means the burial pit. Xunzi has a chapter by this name.\n—lofty as a high terrace,\nBo Jun notes: The *Xunzi* *Dalüe* chapter reads *gao ru* (\"lofty as\").\nLiu Taigong says: *Yi* (\"lofty\") is the same as *gao* (\"high\").\nWang Niansun says: The *Kongzi Jiayu* *Kunshi* chapter also reads *yi ru*.\nWang Su says: *Yi* means \"tall.\"\nThe *Shiwen* notes: *yi* is read *gāo*.\n—orderly as a chief minister,\nThe *Shiwen* notes: It means \"like the prime minister.\"\n—mounded like a hill,\nLu Wenchang says: *Fen ru* means \"like a great embankment.\"\nThe *Shiwen* notes: It means \"like a grave mound.\"\n—partitioned like a tripod.\"\nHao Yixing says: *Ge ru* likely resembles an inverted cauldron, narrow above and wide below—many such are seen today.\nThe *Shiwen* notes: *ge* is read *lì*; its shape is like a *ding*. It may also be read *gé*.\n\n\"Then you will know where rest lies.\"\n**[Note]**: Seeing the grave’s earthen partitions and wings, one knows rest has its place. Zhuangzi said: \"Death is repose.\"\n\nZigong said: \"How great is death! The noble man rests there; the petty man lies low there.\"\n**[Note]**: Knowing destiny and delighting in Heaven, awaiting the end with equanimity—this is how the noble man rests. Escaping sorrow and suffering, dying in darkness—this is how the petty man lies low.\nBo Jun notes: The *Xunzi* *Dalüe* chapter and *Kongzi Jiayu* *Kunshi* chapter both include this passage.\nThe *Shiwen* notes: *Fu yan* (\"lies low\") in Xunzi reads *xiu yan* (\"reposes\"). *Le* (\"delight\") is read *luò*; the same applies below. *Qu* (\"escaping\") is read *qiūlǚ*; *li* (\"sorrow\") is read *lìzhì*; *mei* (\"darkness\") is read *mèi*.\nWu Kaisheng says: *Xi* (\"rests\") and *fu* (\"lies low\") rhyme; reading *xiu* (\"reposes\") is incorrect.\n\nConfucius said: \"Ci! You have understood.\"\n\nMan knows only the joys of life, not its sorrows;\nknows only the weariness of old age,\nnot its ease.\nHe knows the dread of death,\nyet not death as repose.\n\n**[Note]**: *Zhuangzi* says: \"The great clod burdens me with form, labors me with life, eases me with old age, and reposes me in death.\"\n**[Exegesis]**: Life is the substance of activity and use; only in death can one truly rest. It is like the sun’s streaming light—all things move without cease. The noble man pursues fame; the petty man pursues profit; neither ever pauses.\n\nBo Jun notes: The passage cited in the note is from the *Zhuangzi* *Da Zongshi* chapter.\n*Yanzi* says: \"How excellent that the ancients had death!\n**[Note]**: Life and death are the same in all ages, yet he praises only the death of the ancients—this shows that the ancients did not delight in life or dread death.\nThe virtuous find repose in it; the unvirtuous lie low in it.\"\n**[Note]**: Those who cultivate themselves and act with caution, ever mindful of vigilance—these are the virtuous, whose concern is constant. Those who indulge in greed and excess, never satisfied—these are the unvirtuous, whose suffering is ceaseless. Only in death do they find rest and repose.\n\nBo Jun notes: This is from the *Yanzi Chunqiu* *Neijian* chapter.\nDeath is the culmination of virtue.\n**[Note]**: *De* means \"attainment\"; *jiao* means \"return.\" It speaks of each attaining its proper return. The ancients called the dead \"those who have returned.\" If the dead are called \"those who have returned,\" then the living are \"those who are traveling.\" To travel without knowing one’s return is to lose one’s home. If one man loses his home, his generation will condemn him; if the world loses its home, none will condemn it.\n**[Note]**: This is the mutual deception of the many and the few. *Yanzi* and the Mohists made their teachings their home, yet those who prized bodily life did not distinguish this—such words are merely attributed to them.\n\n**[Exegesis]**: *Laozi* says: \"Returning to the root is called stillness; stillness is called the restoration of mandate; restoration of mandate is called constancy; knowing constancy is called illumination. Not knowing constancy, one acts recklessly—calamity follows.\" The spirit’s possession of form is but a single term’s recompense. Deluded by the root and clinging to existence, one wearies the spirit and torments the heart—exhaustion reaches its limit. Only in death does one return to the true, like casting off shackles and laying down a burden. Those who cling to life and death, foolishly attached to existence, do not know to return to the root—yet the world does not condemn them as deluded, for such are many.\n\nBo Jun notes: *Zhuangzi* *Qi Wu Lun* says: \"All their lives they toil without seeing success, wearily worn out and not knowing their return—how pitiful!\" This is precisely the meaning here. Also, the present *Yanzi Chunqiu* *Neijian* chapter reads: *Yanzi* said, \"Long ago, the Lord Above regarded man’s passing as good. The virtuous find repose in it; the unvirtuous lie low in it.\" *Liezi*’s quotation differs only in these three lines. The slight variation in the first line reflects how the ancients, when citing texts, did not adhere strictly to the original wording. Considering the placement of this note, it seems to treat all from \"none will condemn it\" onward as *Yanzi*’s words, hence the comment about attribution. Yet *Yanzi* did indeed say this—Chu Du simply had not seen the *Yanzi* text.\n\nIs there a man who leaves his homeland, parts from his six relations, abandons his family’s livelihood, and wanders the four directions without returning—what manner of man is he? The world will surely call him a mad and dissolute man. And is there a man who clings to worldly worth,\n**[Note]**: \"Clinging to worldly worth\" should read \"prizing bodily life.\"\nwho prides himself on skill and ability, cultivates fame and reputation, and vaunts himself before the world, yet does not know himself—what manner of man is he?\n\nThe world will surely deem him a man of wisdom and strategy. These two types are both lost men. Though their conduct differs in small ways, neither escapes drowning and ruin.\n\nLu Wenchang: \"Drowning\" should read \"weakness,\" as in the *Zhuangzi*; the same applies below.\nBo Jun’s note: The *Zhuangzi*’s \"Equalizing Things\" states, \"How do I know that hating death is not weakness and ruin, forgetting one’s return?\"—this is Lu’s source.\n\nYet the world approves one and rejects the other. Only the sage knows what to embrace and what to abandon. Those who treat life and death as waking and dreaming are to be embraced; those who drown and forget their return are to be abandoned.\n\nTo abandon the root and chase the branch, to labor the spirit and exhaust the mind—whether following emotions to seek fame or pursuing desires to chase profit—both are lost. What is thick, what is thin? What the multitude calls right, the whole world deems correct; what the common cling to, the whole world deems wrong. Only those who possess the Dao know what to leave and what to take.\n\nThus *Zhuangzi* says: Zang and Gu were both herding sheep, and both lost their sheep. One was absorbed in gambling, the other in reading. Though their good and evil differed, the loss of the sheep was the same. If the Dao is lost, then wandering the world and pursuing learning—how far apart are they?\n\nQin Enfu: In the *Zhuangzi*, when asked what Zang was doing, one said, \"Gambling.\" When asked what Gu was doing, one said, \"Reading.\" Lu’s note adds an extra \"absorbed\" after \"gambling,\" which is likely superfluous.\nBo Jun’s note: Here, *yu* (与) means \"to grant,\" as in the *Analects* (\"I grant that you are not as good\") and the *Zuozhuan* (\"You grant it to him\"). The *Liezi* often uses it to mean \"to take,\" and the meanings are interchangeable. The next chapter states: \"Stillness and emptiness obtain their proper place; taking and granting lose their place.\" Stillness and emptiness are synonymous, so taking and granting are also synonymous. Further, in the *Yang Zhu* chapter: \"Fame is not what reality takes; reality is not what fame grants.\" The interchange of *qu* (取, \"take\") and *yu* (与, \"grant\") confirms this.\n\nSomeone asked Master Liezi: \"Why do you value emptiness?\"\nXu Weiyu: The *Lüshi Chunqiu*’s \"No Duality\" states: \"Master Liezi valued emptiness.\"\nLiezi said: \"Emptiness is not to be valued.\"\nAll valuing arises from preferring this over that, affirming oneself and negating things. Now, with the two forgotten and the ten thousand differences merged into one, this is called emptiness. Since emptiness is empty, where can the names of noble and base arise?\n\nIt is not its name. When affairs are manifestly real, they are not obtained through borrowed names. Nothing compares to stillness, nothing compares to emptiness. Stillness and emptiness obtain their proper place; taking and granting lose their place.\n\nThe principle of emptiness and stillness lies beyond the calculations of the mind and the confines of the body. Seek and obtain it, and it is your nature. When inwardly settled in oneself, one is naturally whole and true. Thus, what preserves things does so through emptiness and stillness, obtaining their place of rest; what ruins them does so through movement and seeking, losing their proper place.\n\nSomeone asked about valuing emptiness. The answer was: \"There is nothing to value. My fondness for emptiness is not for its name. When an empty room gives rise to brightness, auspiciousness comes to rest. Only stillness, only emptiness, obtains its proper place. If one is greedy for taking and granting, the spirit loses its peace. Then names, profits, right and wrong converge in contention—how can one bear it? Thus, emptiness is not what *I* value.\"\n\nWhen affairs are broken and ruined, then one dances with benevolence and righteousness—yet they cannot be restored.\n\nOne should act before things arise and govern before disorder begins. When things are already damaged and decayed, then to drum up benevolence and righteousness in hopes of returning to the utmost of nature and life—this cannot be achieved.\n\nWhat I call emptiness is cultivation before disorder arises. If true nature is broken and ruined, the spirit muddled and confused, then to play with the words of benevolence and righteousness or stir the waves of human emotions—this cannot restore it.\n\nTao Hongqing: Zhang’s note interprets \"dancing with benevolence and righteousness\" as \"drumming up benevolence and righteousness,\" which is incorrect. *Wu* (舞) should be read as in \"dancing with words.\" In the \"Confucius\" chapter, \"to act as if dancing—what will those who come think?\" Zhang’s note interprets *wu* as \"to play with,\" which is correct. It means that after affairs are broken and ruined, one applies benevolence and righteousness to patch them up, yet what is ruined cannot be made whole again. The *Daodejing*’s first chapter states, \"When the great Dao declines, there is benevolence and righteousness.\" The *Zhuangzi*’s \"Horse’s Hooves\" states, \"The sage hobbles for benevolence, limps for righteousness, and the world begins to doubt\"—this is the same idea. The note does not grasp it.\n\nThe character *sang* (丧) is pronounced *xilang*. Zhu Xiung states: Liang Zhangju says: Among the various Masters’ texts, the *Yuzi* is the most ancient, yet there are two versions of it. The *Han shu*’s \"Yiwen zhi\" lists twenty-two *pian* of Daoist *Yuzi shuo* and nineteen *pian* of *xiaoshuo* *Yuzi shuo*. The *Liezi* cites *Yuzi* three times, all expounding the Yellow Emperor and Laozi’s teachings on purity and tranquility, which differ from the present text. It is likely that these are the Daoist twenty-two *pian*. Bo Jun notes: The current one-*juan* *Yuzi*, since Ye Mengde of the Song dynasty, has been widely suspected as spurious. The *Siku quanshu zongmu tiyao* suggests it was \"a forgery by later enthusiasts, modeled after the passages cited by Jia Yi,\" which is plausible.\n\nThe *Shiwen* states: *Yu* is pronounced *yu*. Yu Xiong was the teacher of King Wen of Zhou, enfeoffed in Chu, and authored twenty-two *pian* of writings.\n\n\"Revolving without cease\"—the *Shiwen* states: *yi* is pronounced *yi*.\n\"Heaven and earth shift imperceptibly—who perceives it?\"\n\n**[Annotation]** This aligns with the *Zhuangzi*’s \"boat and valley\" passage. Confucius said, \"Day and night without pause, I thus pass away.\" All things embody transformation, and their forms shift with it. Transformation never halts for a moment—how can things remain unchanged? Thus, the form that lived before is not the form that lives now. In the space between a downward and upward glance, ten thousand changes have already occurred. Qi disperses, form decays—not suddenly, but by degrees. Yet the deluded cling to vessels of inevitable change, entrust themselves to ceaseless motion, and claim they can escape transformation. Is this not lamentable?\n\nBo Jun notes: The original text does not separate paragraphs; the division here follows the meaning.\n\nThe *Shiwen* states: *cao* is pronounced *qidao*.\n\n\"Thus, what is diminished there is filled here; what is completed here is depleted there.\"\n\n**[Annotation]** As the saying goes: \"When rivers run dry, valleys empty; when hills level, abysses fill.\" Loss and gain, fullness and emptiness follow the world and accompany death.\n\n**[Annotation]** Here, *shi* (世) should also be read as *sheng* (生).\n\nBo Jun notes: The *Zhuangzi*’s \"Da zongshi\" states, \"Nothing is not destroyed, nothing is not completed,\" which conveys the same idea.\n\nThe *Shiwen* states: *shi* is pronounced *sheng* below as well.\n\n\"Coming and going in succession, with no gap to omit—who perceives it?\"\n\n**[Annotation]** One who has just achieved completion already suffers loss; one who has just been born is already secretly dying.\n\nThe *Shiwen* states: *sheng* is read in the upper tone.\n\n\"Qi does not advance all at once\"—Bo Jun notes: *Jin* (进) originally means \"to ascend,\" as in the *Shuowen*. It also means \"to advance,\" as in the *Mao shi*’s \"Changwu\" *jiang*, the *Shi guan li* *zhu*, and the *Gongyang*’s commentary on the thirteenth year of Duke Zhuang. By extension, it takes the meaning of \"growth.\" Thus, in the *Zhou li*’s \"Xiao sikou,\" \"to regulate the state’s expenditures by advancing or retreating them,\" Zheng Xuan’s annotation explains: \"Advancing and retreating mean increasing and decreasing.\" Here, *jin* contrasts with *kui* (亏), and below, \"unaware of its completion\" follows \"does not advance all at once,\" while \"unaware of its loss\" follows \"does not diminish all at once.\" Thus, *jin* is akin to *cheng* (成).\n\nThe *Shiwen* states: *jin* is pronounced *jinyi*.\n\"A form does not diminish all at once; one is unaware of its completion, unaware of its loss.\"\n\n**[Annotation]** All occurs in obscurity, transforming imperceptibly—how could ears and eyes perceive it?\n\nLu Wenchang notes: In the *Zang* edition, the annotation includes the character *zhi* (之) after \"ears and eyes.\"\n\nBo Jun notes: The original text lacks the character *yi* (亦) before \"unaware of its loss\"; it has been added here following the *Sijie* edition and the Qin engraving.\n\nThe *Shiwen* states: *zhan* is written as *zhu*, pronounced *zhu*; one version writes it as *zhan*.\n\n\"It is like a person from birth\"—the *Shiwen* states: *shi* is pronounced *sheng*.\n\n\"To old age: appearance, complexion, wisdom, and demeanor change daily; skin, nails, and hair fall away with the world, not remaining as they were in infancy.\"\n\n**[Annotation]** Form, color, hair, and skin are the coarser aspects of existence. Even these, renewed and replaced, escape recognition—how much more so the subtler aspects?\n\nBo Jun notes: In the annotation, *zhi cu* (之粗) should not be written as *jing* (精). Lu Baojing’s punctuation, treating \"form, color, hair, and skin\" as a complete phrase, is also incorrect.\n\n\"With no perceptible interval, one only knows afterward.\"\n\n**[Exegesis]** The mind’s subtle operations, the stirring of yin and yang—thus the body transforms, heaven and earth shift imperceptibly, and loss, gain, fullness, and emptiness proceed. Who can awaken to this? Therefore, those who value the Dao know the root and do not grieve over loss.\n\nIn the state of Qi, there was a man who fretted that heaven and earth would collapse, leaving him nowhere to dwell, and thus neglected sleep and food. The *Chuxue ji* writes \"there was a man\" as \"once there was a man.\"\n\nThe *Shiwen* states: *zhui* is written as *sui*.\nThe *Xiben* states: Tang of Yin enfeoffed the Xia descendants in Qi; the Zhou later enfeoffed them there as well. Today, it is Yongqiu County in Chenliu. During the Wude era, it was once established as Qi Prefecture.\n\nRen Dachun notes: The *Chuci*’s \"Jiu ge\" writes *shijiao zhui xi* (矢交坠兮) with *zhui* as *sui*. In the *Xunzi*’s \"Ru xiao\" chapter, \"until their heads meet and the mountains *sui*,\" Yang Liang’s annotation reads: \"*Sui* is read as *zhui*.\" The *Huainanzi*’s \"Shuolin xun\" states, \"Things suspended and hanging may *sui* at times,\" with the annotation: \"*Sui* means *zhui*.\" In the *Han shu*’s \"Wang Mang zhuan,\" \"not *sui* like a hair,\" and in the \"Xu zhuan,\" \"their lineage will not *sui*,\" *bu sui* means *bu zhui*. The *Lishi*’s \"Xixia song\" and the \"Heng hai jiangjun Lü jun bei\" write *yun sui* as *yun zhui*. The \"Fan An bei\" writes *shi sui* as *shi zhui*. The *Jingshun shiwen* still preserves the ancient character.\n\nBo Jun notes: Wude was the reign title of Emperor Gaozu of Tang. Huang Yaopu suspected the *Shiwen* was a Song forgery (see the postscript to the Northern Song edition of the *Liezi*), but this passage disproves that. Moreover, the state of Qi, enfeoffed at the beginning of the Zhou, corresponds to present-day Qi County in the Kaifeng region of Henan. The *Shiji* includes its *shijia*.\n\nThere was another who, troubled by the first man’s worries, went to enlighten him.\n\n**[Annotation]** The first man’s worries were misguided, yet the second, though not misguided himself, worried over the first man’s misguided concerns rather than the actual cause of his distress. This analogy illustrates how accumulated delusions deepen—how could one enlighten the other?\n\nThe *Daozang* edition’s annotation includes the character *zai* 哉 after *ye* 也.\n\nBo Jun notes: The annotation \"以不忧忧彼之所忧\" should read \"不忧彼之所忧.\"\n\nHe said: \"Heaven is but accumulated *qi*, without place lacking *qi*. As you bend and stretch, inhale and exhale, you move and rest within it all day—why fear its collapse?\"\n\n**[Annotation]** The azure of heaven is not a solid substance. Thus, what we call \"heaven\" is not merely distant and boundless. All above the earth is heaven. Therefore, in every breath and movement, you never depart from it.\n\nThe *Hebi Shilei Qianji* cites this as: \"Why fear its collapse?\"\n\nThe man said: \"If heaven is truly accumulated *qi*, should not the sun, moon, and stars fall?\"\n\n**[Annotation]** *Xiu* (lunar lodges), pronounced identically below.\n\nThe enlightener replied: \"The sun, moon, and stars are but luminous entities within accumulated *qi*.\"\n\n**[Annotation]** What is *qi* incapable of sustaining? Even the vastness of heaven and earth abides naturally within the realm of the Great Void—how much more so the mutual support of *qi* itself?\n\nThe *Yulin* (vol. 2) cites *chen* 辰 instead of *xiu* 宿.\n\nWang Chongmin notes: The character *zhi* 之 after \"enlightener\" is redundant, carried over from the earlier phrase \"went to enlighten him.\" The *Yulin* (vol. 2) cites this as \"the enlightener said,\" omitting *zhi*. The subsequent passage, \"The enlightener said, 'Earth is but accumulated clods...'\" also lacks *zhi*, confirming this.\n\nThe phrase \"luminous entities within accumulated *qi*\" in the *Yulin* (vols. 3 and 6) inverts \"within\" and \"*qi*,\" which may reflect the original.\n\n**[Annotation]** *Sheng* 勝, pronounced *sheng*.\n\n\"Even if they fell, they could cause no harm.\"\n\nThe *Yiwen Leiju* (vol. 1), *Chuxue Ji* (vol. 1), and *Shiwen Leiju Qianji* (vol. 2) cite this as \"正复使坠.\"\n\nWu Kaisheng notes: *Zhishi* 只使 means \"even if,\" though it is not language from the Three Dynasties.\n\n**[Annotation]** *Zhong* 中, pronounced *dingzhong*.\n\nThe man said: \"What of the earth’s ruin?\"\n\nThe enlightener replied: \"Earth is but accumulated clods.\"\n\n**[Annotation]** *Kuai* 块, pronounced *koudui*.\n\n\"It fills the four voids, without place lacking clods.\"\n\n**[Annotation]** *Sai* 塞, pronounced *suze*.\n\nBo Jun notes: The *Yanshi Jiaxun*’s \"Guixin\" chapter states, \"Heaven is accumulated *qi*; earth is accumulated clods,\" seemingly drawing from this passage.\n\n\"As you tread and trample upon it, you move and rest upon the earth all day—why fear its ruin?\"\n\n**[Annotation]** The four characters *chu* 躇, *bu* 步, *ci* 跐, and *dao* 蹈 all describe the act of treading.\n\n*Chu* 躇, pronounced *chu*; *ci* 跐, pronounced *ci*; *dao* 蹈, pronounced *tudao*.\n\nThe man, suddenly relieved, rejoiced greatly.\n\n**[Annotation]** *She* 舍 should be *shi* 释; in this text, *shi* is written as *she*.\n\n**[Annotation]** *She* 舍, pronounced *shi*, identically below.\n\nThe enlightener, too, was suddenly relieved and rejoiced greatly.\n\n**[Annotation]** These two men—one fretted over inevitable destruction, the other rejoiced in inevitable preservation. Neither understood the true grounds for worry or joy, yet they consoled and enlightened each other, resolving their own doubts. This remains no less than profound delusion.\n\n**[Exegesis]** Heaven is accumulated *qi*—where is *qi* absent? Earth is accumulated clods—where are clods absent? Clods conceal nothing; *qi* collapses nowhere. The sun and moon are luminous entities within *qi*—why fear their collapse?\n\n**[Annotation]** In the *Daozang* and *Shidetang* editions, \"必败\" replaces \"必破.\"\n\nUpon hearing this, Changluzi laughed.\n\nBo Jun notes: The *Yulin* (vol. 2) omits *zhi* 之, which is correct and should be deleted. The subsequent passage, \"When Master Liezi heard this, he laughed,\" also lacks *zhi*, confirming this.\n\n**[Annotation]** The *Shiwen* cites *Changluzi* as *Changluzǐ*, noting: The *Records of the Grand Historian* mentions a Changluzi from Chu. The *Hanshu* states that Changluzi authored nine chapters, classified under the Daoist school.\n\nRen Dachun notes: The *Xunzi*’s \"Fuguo\" chapter reads \"君卢屋妾,\" with Yang Liang’s annotation glossing *lúwū* as *lúwū* (hut). The *Zhuangzi*’s \"Rangwang\" chapter mentions \"□水,\" with the *Shiwen* reading *lǘ* (闾), while Sima Biao’s edition has *Lu* (卢) water. The *Huainanzi*’s \"Shuolin Xun\" states, \"The potter uses a cracked basin; the carpenter dwells in a narrow *lú* (庐),\" where *lú* is *lú* (hut). The *Guoyu*’s \"Jinyu\" reads, \"侏儒扶卢,\" with Wei Zhao’s annotation: \"*Lu* is the shaft of a spear or halberd.\" The *Kaogong Ji* states, \"Qin lacks *lú*,\" with the annotation: \"The handle of a spear or halberd, a bundled bamboo shaft.\" Thus, *lu* and *lú* are interchangeable. The *Wu Yue Chunqiu* reads \"吴子柯卢,\" while the *Shiji* writes *lú* (庐) instead of *lu* (卢). The *Zuozhuan* (Duke Huan, Year 13) *Shiwen* reads *lúróng* (庐戎) as written, with some editions using *lu* (卢), pronounced identically. The *Zuozhuan* (Duke Cheng, Year 13) *Shiwen* reads *Bólú* (伯庐), pronounced *lìwú*, with some editions using *lu* (卢). Thus, *lu* and *lú* are interchangeable, corroborating the *Shiwen*’s *lú* (卢). Furthermore, the *Shiji*’s \"Shen Dao\" chapter mentions \"Chu had Shizi Changlu,\" with the *Suoyin* noting, \"Changlu is unclear,\" evidently unaware of this passage in the *Liezi*.\n\nHe said: \"Rainbows and mirages, clouds and mist, wind and rain, the four seasons—these are the formations of accumulated *qi* that constitute heaven. Mountains and peaks, rivers and seas, metals and stones, fire and wood—these are the formations of accumulated shapes that constitute earth. Knowing that heaven is accumulated *qi* and earth accumulated clods—how can one claim they do not decay?\"\n\n**[Annotation]** Before the primordial chaos divided, heaven and earth were one *qi*, and the myriad things were one form. Once separated into heaven and earth, dispersed into the myriad things, this reflects only the divergence of convergence and dispersion, the emptiness and fullness of form and *qi*. Heaven and earth are but a tiny thing within the void, the greatest entity within the bounded. That they are difficult to exhaust or fathom is surely so.\n\n**[Annotation]** *Zui* 最, pronounced *ziwai*.\n\nDifficult to fathom, difficult to comprehend—this is surely so.\n\n**[Annotation]** *Zhong* 终 and *qiong* 穷 rhyme, both in the ancient *dong* 冬 rhyme group. *Ce* 测 and *shi* 识 rhyme, both in the ancient *zhi* 职/*de* 德 rhyme group.\n\nThose who fret over their decay are indeed far off the mark; those who claim they do not decay are likewise mistaken. Heaven and earth cannot but decay, and thus must return to decay. When their time of decay arrives, how can one not grieve?\n\n**[Annotation]** This is to know that what has a beginning must have an end, and what has form must decay; yet it fails to recognize the vicissitudes of fortune and the ascent and descent of yin and yang, the rise and fall of vessels and heaven and earth.\n\n**[Exegesis]** Accumulated *qi* and accumulated clods form heaven and earth. What is accumulated and formed cannot but decay. Yet their vastness makes their end difficult to perceive. If one encounters their time of decay, one cannot but grieve.\n\n**[Note]** The original text read *bi bai* 必败 (\"must fail\") for *bi huai* 必坏 (\"must decay\"); this has been emended following the *Zang* 藏 edition. Another exegesis reads the four characters *bu de bu you* 不得不忧 (\"cannot but grieve\") as *he de bu you* 何得不忧 (\"how can one not grieve\"). *Bu ke ze jian* 不可则见 should read *bu ke ce jian* 不可测见 (\"cannot be perceived\").\n\nMaster Liezi heard this and laughed, saying: \"Those who speak of heaven and earth decaying are mistaken, and those who speak of them not decaying are likewise mistaken. Decay and non-decay—I cannot know which is so. Nevertheless, that is one possibility, and this is another.\n\n**[Annotation]** \"That\" refers to those who claim non-decay; \"this\" refers to those who claim decay.\n\nIf they do not decay, then they endure together with humanity; if they decay, then they perish together with humanity. Why rejoice or grieve over such a matter? Thus, the living do not know death, and the dead do not know life; the coming do not know the going, and the going do not know the coming.\"\n\n\"Decay or non-decay—how could I harbor concern for such a matter?\"\n\n**[Annotation]** Not knowing life is like not knowing death. Thus, when things come to be, none know their dissolution; and when they dissolve, how can one know their coming to be? This is the manifest proof of going and coming, the clear evidence of success and failure. Yet I am equally present in both, with no distinction of feeling between them—where could the heart find room to dwell?\n\n**[Exegesis]** Now, heaven and earth are the greatest of things, while bodily forms are the smallest. Yet the great are but one thing, and the small are but one thing. All things must decay—why debate the matter? Moreover, in life one does not know death, and in death one does not know life; coming and going are not self-aware, and success and failure cannot be fathomed. If one examines oneself closely, one cannot even know these things—why then expend the heart’s effort on heaven and earth, or grieve and debate over matters beyond the realm of things?\n\n**[Phonetic Gloss]** *See* (見) is pronounced *xiàn*. *Chu* (处) is pronounced *chǔ*.\n\nShun asked Zheng, saying—**[Annotation]** Pi Xirui notes: *Zheng* (烝) should be *Cheng* (丞). **[Collation]** Bo Jun observes: Pi’s emendation is correct. The *Zhuangzi* \"Knowledge Wanders North\" chapter writes it as *Cheng* (丞), and the *Taiping Imperial Encyclopedia* (519) also cites it as *Cheng*. The *Phonetic Gloss* writes *Zheng* (烝) as *Cheng* (丞), noting: \"Cheng refers to an assistant or minister; one variant writes it as *Zheng*.\" Ren Dachun comments: The *Han Shu* \"Table of the Kings’ Sons and Lords\" records \"Chengyang Lord Jing,\" with Yan Shigu noting: \"*Cheng* is pronounced *zhēng*; the character may also be written as *Cheng* (丞).\" In the *Biography of Zhai Fangjin*, \"the Grand Protector’s assistant Chengyang Lord Zhen Han,\" Yan Shigu notes: \"*Cheng* is pronounced *zhēng*.\" The *Hou Han Shu* \"Treatise on Commanderies and States\" writes it as *Zhengyang* Lord. Since *Cheng* (承) and *Cheng* (丞) both have the pronunciation *zhēng*, they are interchangeable as *Zheng* (烝). Jing Shun’s *Phonetic Gloss* preserves the ancient reading by writing *Cheng* (丞) as *Zheng* (烝).\n\n\"Can the Dao be possessed and held?\"\n\n**[Annotation]** Shun wished to clarify that all beings are ultimately the same as non-being, so he took the Dao as the starting point of his question.\n\nLu Wenchang notes: At the end of the annotation, the Zang edition includes the character *ye* (也).\n\nThe reply came: \"Your body is not your own—how could you possess the Dao?\"\n\n**[Annotation]** Guo Xiang says: The body is not something you can possess; it simply exists of itself, a mere clod. If you do not even possess what you have, how much less can you possess what you do not have?\n\n**[Exegesis]** \"You\" and \"I\" are merely designations for self and other in bodily form, not references to the spirit. Common usage takes one’s own body as \"I\" and others as \"you.\" How then can one seek to possess the Dao? Thus it is said: \"Your body is not your own—how could you possess the Dao?\"\n\nShun said: \"If my body is not my own, then who possesses it?\"\n\n**[Annotation]** Since one possesses this body, the question is posed again.\n\n**[Phonetic Gloss]** *Chong* (重) is pronounced *zhòng*; the same below.\n\nThe reply came: \"It is the form bestowed by heaven and earth.\"\n\n**[Annotation]** It is a partial accumulation of the single qi.\n\nYu Yue notes: The *Strategies of the Warring States* (\"Qi Strategies\") states: \"I wish to entrust it to Zihigh,\" with the commentary: \"*Wei* (委) means to entrust.\" The *Zuozhuan* (Duke Cheng, second year) records: \"The king sent it to be entrusted to the three officials.\" Du Yu’s commentary: \"*Wei* (委) means to assign.\" Thus, \"the form bestowed by heaven and earth\" means the form assigned by heaven and earth. The three subsequent instances of *wei* (委) follow the same sense.\n\n\"Life is not your own—it is the harmony bestowed by heaven and earth.\"\n\n**[Annotation]** The accumulation of harmony gives rise to life.\n\n\"Your nature and destiny are not your own—they are the compliance bestowed by heaven and earth.\"\n\n**[Annotation]** The accumulation of compliance results in preservation and perishing.\n\nGuo Xiang says: If the body were yours to possess, then beauty and ugliness, life and death would be determined by you. Yet when qi gathers to form life, you cannot prevent it; when qi scatters in death, you cannot halt it. This shows that it forms and completes itself through its own bestowal—it is not yours to possess.\n\n\"Your children and grandchildren are not your own—they are the moltings bestowed by heaven and earth.\"\n\n**[Annotation]** Qi naturally accumulates and sheds like a cicada’s molting. If they were yours to possess, then the number of sons and daughters would also be determined by you.\n\n**[Collation]** The *Liu Tie* (10) and *Taiping Imperial Encyclopedia* (519) cite \"children and grandchildren\" as \"descendants.\" It is likely that this should be followed. Zhang’s commentary on the passage below reads: \"Where are descendants bestowed and molted?\" suggesting that his edition also read \"descendants.\"\n\n**[Phonetic Gloss]** *Tui* (蜕) is pronounced *shuì*.\n\nThus, in walking one does not know where one is going; in dwelling one does not know what one is holding; in eating one does not know the reason for it.\n\n**[Annotation]** All arise spontaneously from within, not through conscious knowledge.\n\nYu Yue notes: The *Zhuangzi* \"Knowledge Wanders North\" chapter writes: \"In eating, one does not know the taste.\"\n\nWang Shumin says: The *Exegesis of the Sage’s Meaning* by Emperor Huizong of Song and Fan Zhixu’s *Exegesis* both read \"does not know the taste\" for \"does not know the reason,\" matching the *Zhuangzi*.\n\n\"The forceful yang of heaven and earth is qi—how then could it be possessed?\"\n\nThe empty space here [indicates a lacuna in the text].\n\n**[Annotation]** Heaven and earth are the greatest of the interwoven knots of return. Now, in walking, dwelling, eating, and resting, all are movements of the forceful yang qi—how could one recognize their underlying reason? \"Forceful yang\" means \"unyielding solidity.\" If it is not the ultimate principle of unyielding solidity, and one returns instead to the extreme of emptiness and harmony, then there is no form, no life, no death, no end—so where could one’s nature and life be entrusted and follow? Where could descendants be entrusted and molted? Where could walking and dwelling find rest? On what could eating and drinking depend?\n\n**[Exegesis]** Since one does not know that the numinous and luminous are the Dao, one borrows heaven and earth to explain it. Heaven governs numinous function; earth governs formed things. Those who engage with existence entrust their forms; those who embody harmony give rise to their natures; those who respond in function follow and comply; those who nurture emotions and rear offspring entrust and molt. Now, in your walking, stopping, eating, and resting, you know only the movements of forceful yang, yet do not know the true master of the numinous and luminous. How then could you possess the Dao?\n\nSomeone asked: \"Yu Shun was a sage—how could he not know the Dao?\"\nThe answer: \"When one borrows guest and host to debate confusion, how could one remain in profound silence alone? Yet *Zhuangzi* says: 'Puliang Yi had the talent of a sage but not the Dao of a sage; I have the Dao of a sage but not the talent of a sage.' Thus, those who possess talent to aid the world and occupy the throne of the ruler do not necessarily know the Dao. Those who dwell beneath mountain forests with a reputation for solitary integrity do not necessarily govern others. Therefore, the Yellow Emperor, after thirty years on the throne, only then dreamed of the Land of Huaxu. Yao, after meeting the Four Masters, only then gazed in wonder at the northern bank of the Fen River. That Shun had not yet awakened—what is strange about that?\"\n\n**[Note]** In the line \"If it is not unyielding solidity,\" four editions read \"and is not unyielding solidity.\"\n\nWang Chongmin says: In the *Zhuangzi* \"Knowledge Wanders North\" chapter, there is a \"之\" after \"heaven and earth,\" which cannot be omitted here. It is likely that the *Liezi* originally included this \"之,\" but it is now missing from the current edition.\n\nGuo Xiang’s commentary states: \"Forceful yang is merely movement.\" Furthermore, in the \"Parables\" chapter, it says: \"If they come, I come with them; if they go, I go with them; if they are forceful yang, I am forceful yang with them.\" Guo Xiang’s commentary explains: \"Simply following the spontaneous movements of forceful yang in coming and going.\" Thus, \"forceful yang\" carries the meaning of movement, likely sharing the same iterative rhyme as *changyang* and *xiangyang*. This means that the life, nature, and descendants of the self are not possessed by the person but are all interwoven knots of heaven and earth. Moreover, one does not know that the rotation and movement of heaven and earth are also the work of a single qi. If one understands that the rotation of heaven and earth is the movement of qi, then how could anything between heaven and earth be possessed? The phrase \"the forceful yang of heaven and earth\" should be punctuated after \"heaven and earth.\" Without the \"之,\" the meaning would be unclear.\n\nZhang’s commentary says: \"Forceful yang means unyielding solidity,\" which is incorrect.\n\n**[Phonetic Gloss]** *Fu* (復) is pronounced *fú*.\n\nThe Guo family of Qi was immensely wealthy, while the Xiang family of Song was extremely poor.\n\n**[Phonetic Gloss]** *Xiang* (向) is pronounced *xiàng*.\n\nThe Xiang family traveled from Song to Qi to ask for their method. The Guo family told them: \"I am skilled in theft. When I first began stealing, after one year I had enough; after two years, I was sufficient; after three years, I greatly prospered.\"\n\n**[Note]** *Rang* (穰) was originally written as *rang* (壤).\n\nHong Yi says: In the *Zhuangzi* \"Gengsang Chu\" chapter, it says: \"After three years, the people of Weilei greatly prospered.\" The phonetic gloss notes: \"Cui’s edition writes *rang* (穰).\" In ancient times, the character *rang* (穰) was always written as *rang* (壤).\n\nWang Chongmin says: The *Shuowen* defines *rang* (穰) as \"millet that has sprouted and grown.\" Under the character *yang* (秧), it says: \"Rice seedlings are like *yangrang* (秧穰).\" *Yangrang* are iterative rhyme characters, like *rangrang* (穰穰). Thus, *rang* has two meanings, and *yangrang* is the origin of the meaning of \"great prosperity\" here. Furthermore, according to the *Shuowen*, *rang* (壤) means \"soft earth.\" Since *rang* (壤) is the ancient character, there is no evidence for it in antiquity, and it is likely that later people confused the two. The meaning of *rang* (穰) is closer to the intended sense. Xu Shen also used it to explain characters, so *rang* (穰) is the older form. The Cui edition of *Zhuangzi* and the alternate edition seen by Lu Deming both write *rang* (穰), as does the *Liezi* Jifu edition and the *Taiping Yulan* (485), which also write *rang* (穰).\n\nYang Bojun’s note: Wang’s argument is sound; here, we follow the Jifu edition in writing *rang* (穰).\n\n**[Phonetic Gloss]** *Rang* (穰) is written as *rang* (壤), glossed as *rǎng*, and also written as *rang* (穰).\n\n\"From then on, [my prosperity] extended to the towns and villages.\"\n\n**[Note]** *Shi* (施) means \"to bestow\" (as in the *Guoyu* commentary to \"Duke Qi loved to display his efforts and bestow favors\").\n\n**[Phonetic Gloss]** *Shi* (施) is pronounced *yì*, meaning \"to extend.\"\n\nThe Xiang family was overjoyed. They understood the words about theft but did not grasp the Dao of theft.\n\n**[Note]** In the *Liu Tie* (91), the first \"understood\" (*yu*, 喻) is written as \"heard\" (*wen*, 聞), and \"Dao\" (道) is written as \"meaning\" (*yi*, 意).\n\nThey then climbed walls and tunneled through houses, taking everything their hands and eyes reached.\n\n**[Note]** In the *Liu Tie* (91), \"tunneled through houses\" (*zao shi*, 凿室) is written as \"pierced the eaves\" (*chuan yu*, 穿宇), and \"taking\" (*tan ye*, 探也) is written as \"taking away\" (*tan qu*, 探取).\n\n**[Phonetic Gloss]** *Wang* (亡) is pronounced *wú*; the same below.\n\nBefore long, they were caught with stolen goods and punished.\n\n**[Phonetic Gloss]** *Zang* (赃) is pronounced *zāng*.\n\nThey lost all the wealth they had previously accumulated.\n\nYu Yue says: \"Accumulated\" (*ju*, 居) means \"stored,\" referring to the wealth they had previously stored. In the *Analects*, \"Zang Wenzhong accumulated a *cai*\" (*Lunyu* \"Gongye Chang\"), and Huang Kan’s commentary says: \"*Ju* means 'to store.'\" This is the same meaning.\n\nWu Kaisheng says: *Ju* (居) should be read as *zhu* (贮).\n\nWang Chongmin says: The *Taiping Yulan* (485) writes \"former lord\" (*xian jun*, 先君), which is better in meaning.\n\nYang Bojun’s note: In the \"King Mu of Zhou\" chapter, it says: \"Offering half of his accumulated wealth to request their methods.\" Here, *ju* also means \"to accumulate.\" Yu’s and Wu’s interpretations are the same and can both be used. The *Taiping Yulan* does not grasp the meaning and arbitrarily changes it to \"lord\" (*jun*, 君), which cannot be trusted.\n\nThe *Explanation of Text* states: \"Former\" (*xian*, 先) is pronounced *xiàn* (悉荐切).\n\nWhen the Xiang clan was deceived by the Guo clan, Qian Yi says: \"Deceived\" (*miu*, 谬) means \"to cheat.\" They went and resented them. The Guo clan said: \"What would you do if you were a thief?\" The Xiang clan described their situation. The Guo clan said: \"Alas!\" The *Explanation of Text* states: \"Alas\" (*xi*, 嘻) is pronounced *xī* (熙), a sound of grief and pain. \"Have you lost the Dao of thievery to this extent? Now I shall tell you. I have heard that Heaven has its seasons, Earth has its advantages.\" The annotation states: referring to spring, autumn, winter, and summer, and all that the earth produces. Below \"produces\" (*chu*, 出) in the annotation, all versions lack the character \"that which\" (*suo*, 所); this follows the *Four Explanations* edition and adds it.\n\n\"I steal Heaven and Earth’s timely advantages,\" the *Explanation of Text* states: the sentence ends here. \"The soaking moisture of clouds and rain,\" the *Explanation of Text* states: \"soaking\" (*pang*, 滂) is pronounced *pāng* (普郎切). \"The products nurtured by mountains and marshes, to grow my grain, cultivate my crops,\" the *Six Excerpts* (9.1) quotes it as \"grow my millet, cultivate my grains.\" \"I build my walls,\" the *Explanation of Text* writes \"cultivate\" (*zhi*, 殖) as \"plant\" (*zhi*, 植) and states: \"build\" (*zhu*, 筑) is pronounced *zhú* (竹). \"Walls\" (*yuan*, 垣) is pronounced *yuán* (袁). \"Plant\" (*zhi*, 植) is pronounced *zhí* (时职切). Yang Bojun notes: The pronunciation of \"plant\" in the *Explanation of Text* appears below \"walls,\" suggesting that the version Jing Shun saw read: \"I build my walls, construct my dwellings, grow my grain, plant my crops.\" \"I construct my dwellings. On land, I steal birds and beasts; in water, I steal fish and turtles,\" the *Explanation of Text* states: \"turtle\" (*bie*, 鳖) is pronounced *biē* (并列切). \"There is nothing that is not stolen. Grain, crops, earth, trees, birds, beasts, fish, and turtles—all are born of Heaven. How can they be mine?\" The annotation states: Heaven cannot even produce itself, so how can it produce things? People cannot even possess themselves, so how can they possess things? This clarifies that things produce and possess themselves.\n\n\"Yet when I steal from Heaven, I incur no misfortune.\" The annotation states: Heaven does not impose its bestowals; I act with impartiality—where could resentment arise? The *Commentary on the Yin Fu Jing* quotes it as: \"I steal from Heaven and Earth yet incur no misfortune or blame.\" The *Explanation of Text* states: \"bestow\" (*shi*, 施) is pronounced *shì* (尸智切). \"As for gold, jade, precious treasures, grain, silk, wealth, and goods,\" the Qin engraved edition writes \"gold, jade, precious treasures\" as \"grain, earth, crops, treasures.\" \"These are what people accumulate—how can they be what Heaven bestows?\" The annotation states: Heaven cannot even bestow, so how can people accumulate? This also clarifies that things can bestow and accumulate themselves. Yang Bojun notes: The annotation \"can bestow and accumulate themselves\" should read \"can bestow and possess themselves.\" \"If you steal them and incur punishment, whom should you resent?\" The annotation states: People possess their wealth; I violate their private interests—this is why blame arises.\n\nThe *Explanation* states: Heaven and Earth are not benevolent; they treat the myriad things as straw dogs. Since they have no feeling for nurturing life, how could they have a mind for giving and taking? The great devour the small, the wise enslave the foolish. They seize opportunities to pursue profit and use force to serve their private ends.\n\n\"Movement and use, taking and giving—all are theft. Yet with people’s wealth, it is not so: one guards and supplies oneself, and taking it incurs punishment—whom should one resent for this? Xiang Shi was greatly perplexed, believing that Guo Shi had deceived him.\" Yang Bojun notes: *Wang* (罔) should be read as in the *Analects*, *Yong Ye* chapter: \"one cannot *wang* (deceive) them.\" The *Han Shu*, *Yang Xiong Zhuan* reads: \"one cannot act deviously or *wang* (deceive)\"; the annotation states: *Wang* means \"to falsely accuse.\" The *Shi Wen* notes: *Wang* is pronounced *wen liang*.\n\nHe passed by Master Dongguo and asked him. \"Passed by\" (*guo*): The Northern Song edition reads \"encountered\" (*yu*); Wang’s edition follows this, but here we follow the *Zang* edition, *Si Jie* edition, and *Shi De Tang* edition in correcting it. The *Shi Wen* notes: *Guo* is pronounced *ge*, and is also written as the character *yu*.\n\nMaster Dongguo said: \"Is not your very body likewise theft? You steal the harmony of yin and yang to complete your life, to sustain your form.\" Yu Yue notes: *Zai* (载) also means \"to complete.\" The *Shang Shu*, *Gao Yao Mo* chapter reads: \"Then he continued the song, saying...\"; Ma Rong’s commentary states: *Zai* means \"to complete\"—this is its meaning here. \"How much more so with external things—are they not theft?\" The annotation states: Is it not that you possess theft?\n\nThe body is but one thing among Heaven and Earth; it cannot be privately possessed. If it is not theft, then there is no distinction between internal and external. The *Si Jie* edition reads: \"cannot but be privately possessed\" for the annotation \"cannot be privately possessed.\"\n\nTruly, Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things do not stand apart. To claim and possess them is delusion. The annotation states: Now, Heaven and Earth are the collective designation of the myriad things; the myriad things are the distinct names of Heaven and Earth. Though each privately possesses its own body, in principle they do not stand apart. To claim and possess them is the delusion of the mind.\n\nThus, when Heaven and Earth entrust us with form, it is not ours to own. To adorn and cherish appearance, to boast of wisdom and ability—this is already delusion. To go further and arbitrarily claim external things as one’s own, to display one’s name and lineage to set oneself apart, to rely on kin for security, to array fine robes to dazzle others, to wield titles and rank to sway the crowd, to amass wealth and property, to cultivate factions and power—all one’s life to delight in these without ever awakening to oneself.\n\nThus Laozi said, \"That which is my great affliction is that I have a body.\" Zhuangzi said, \"Of the hundred limbs and six viscera, with which am I most intimate?\" Grasping this principle, the heart-mind becomes as empty as the Great Void, and the bodily form exists together with the myriad things.\n\nLu Wenchong notes: In the *Zang* edition of the annotation, *chi* (饬) is written as *shi* (饰); after \"That which is my great affliction,\" there is the character *zhe* (者); and \"Great Void\" is written as \"Grand Void.\" Bo Jun notes: \"To claim and possess them\" in the *Zang* edition is written as \"to recognize and possess them\"; *ren* (仞) is *ren* (认). In the *Zhou Mu Wang* chapter of this text, \"dreaming of recognizing a deer as a man,\" the *Shi Wen* notes: \"One edition writes *ren* (认) for *ren* (仞),\" which serves as evidence. The *Shi Wen* writes \"Grand\" for \"Great,\" and notes: *ren* is pronounced *ren*; *cheng* (称) is pronounced *zheng*; *fu* (复) is pronounced *fou*; *wu zhi wei* (吾之为) is pronounced *wu zhi wei* (于伪切); *zang* (藏) is pronounced *cang*.\n\nThe theft of the Guo clan was in accord with the public Dao, thus incurring no misfortune; the theft of the Ruo clan arose from private motives, thus incurring guilt.\n\n**[Annotation]** \"Public\" is the opposite of \"private\"; without the private, the name \"public\" ceases to exist. Now to regard transgressing Heaven as \"public\" and transgressing man as \"private\" does not fully accord with principle.\n\n**[Exegesis]** Heaven and Earth are without private motives; to take from them is without opposition, thus no misfortune arises. The human heart harbors private motives; to take with such intent is theft. To take what is privately held with a private heart—private motives entail opposition—how could guilt not follow? Thus, laws exist to restrain private motives; without opposition, there would be no prohibitions.\n\nBo Jun notes: In the exegesis, \"to take with such intent\" (*qu zhi you qing*) should read \"to take with opposition\" (*qu zhi you dui*). *Dui* means what is now called \"the opposing party.\"\n\nThose who act with public or private motives are likewise thieves.\n\n**[Annotation]** The distinction lies only in what they transgress; they are not free from theft.\n\nThose who are without public or private motives are likewise thieves.\n\n**[Annotation]** The self cannot but exist, and wealth cannot but accumulate; to then seek to relinquish them is not to be one who is immediately without motive.\n\n**[Exegesis]** The sage establishes laws and teachings to prevent harm to others and encroachment upon the multitude—these are not theft. Those who do not violate the law act in accord with the public Dao; those who violate the law act in accord with the private Dao. Even if one does not violate the public but appropriates for oneself, this is likewise theft—how much more so when one violates the law to enrich oneself?\n\nThe exegesis reads, \"how much more so when violating the law to enrich oneself\" (*kuang wei fa feng ji*); the Qin edition has \"violating the law and teachings\" (*wei fa jiao hua*). Here, we follow the Four Exegeses edition for correction.\n\nPublic and private, public and private—these are the virtues of Heaven and Earth.\n\n**[Annotation]** Life is but one principle of Heaven and Earth; the body is but one thing of Heaven and Earth. What one now cherishes and begrudges is simply to cherish and begrudge the life and body born between Heaven and Earth. In affairs, there is no public or private; in principle, there is no cherishing or begrudging.\n\nThe *Shi Wen* notes: *lin* (吝) is pronounced *liang ren*.\n\nThose who know the virtue of Heaven and Earth—who is a thief? Who is not a thief?\n\n**[Annotation]** What is the virtue of Heaven and Earth? It is simply spontaneity, spontaneity alone. Where is there room to impose the names of public and private? Once the names of public and private are abolished, theft and non-theft differ not in principle.\n\n**[Exegesis]** To know the public and the private yet be without private motives, to be of the same pattern as things yet not find them strange—this is the virtue of Heaven and Earth. If one knows the virtue of Heaven and Earth and takes without private motives, this is not to deceive Heaven. To take without differing from the multitude, to obtain without private motives, is not theft. If so, who is a thief? Who is not a thief? Only those who have fully realized the spirit and awakened to the Dao know this.\n\nThe annotation \"厝其公私之名\" (placing the names of public and private) appears in various editions as \"历\" (experience), but the present text follows the *Zang* edition in correcting it. The exegesis \"若知天地之德\" (if one knows the virtue of Heaven and Earth) appears in the *Qin* edition as \"万\" (ten thousand), but the present text follows the *Sijie* edition in correcting it.\n\nLu Wenchong notes: In the annotation \"自然而已\" (simply spontaneity alone), the *Zang* edition does not repeat these four characters.\nThe *Shiwen* states: 厝 is pronounced *cuo*.\n\n*Liezi Jishi*, Volume Two: \"The Yellow Emperor,\" Second Chapter\n\n**[Annotation]** That which is endowed at birth is called *xing* (nature); to fully realize one’s nature is called *he* (harmony). Thus, when one responds to principle and abides in accordance, whatever one encounters is always unobstructed. When one follows the emotions and turns against the Dao, one meets with things and is immediately impeded.\n\n**[Exegesis]** This clarifies the forgetting of form to nurture the spirit, following the profound and the silent to bring forth true wisdom. At the beginning of nurturing, one abandons the myriad existences and inwardly settles the mind. When wisdom is brought forth, one transforms living beings and outwardly engages with things. Thus, in its initial stage, one purifies the mind and disciplines the body, not becoming entangled in political affairs. By the final chapter, one assists Confucius and Mozi in aiding others. This is its great purport.\n\nIn the fifteenth year of his reign, the Yellow Emperor rejoiced that all under Heaven bore him [on their shoulders].\n\n**[Annotation]** He rejoiced in accordance with the times.\n\nWang Shumin states: The *Lushi Houji* (Volume Five, Annotation) includes the character \"之\" (him) before \"戴\" (bear), and it should be followed. \"喜天下之戴己\" (rejoiced that all under Heaven bore him) matches the syntax of the following phrase, \"忧天下之不治\" (worried that all under Heaven was not well-governed). The *Yiwen Leiju* (Volume Eleven) also includes the character \"之\" before \"戴.\"\n\nHe nourished his *zhengming* (proper destiny).\n\n**[Annotation]** *Zheng* (proper) should be *xing* (nature).\n\nYu Yue states: *Zheng* (proper) should be *sheng* (life). The ancient characters *sheng* (life) and *xing* (nature) were interchangeable. In the *Zhouli* (*Rites of Zhou*), the *Da Situ* (Grand Minister of Education) states, \"Distinguishing the *wu di* (five lands) by their *wu sheng* (five products),\" where Du Zichun reads *sheng* as *xing*. This is an example. The original text of the *Liezi* reads \"养生命\" (nourishing life and destiny), for *sheng* (life) is *xing* (nature), and thus it was mistakenly written as *zheng* (proper). Zhang’s annotation, \"正当为性\" (*zheng* should be *xing*), though correct in identifying the character, overlooks the ancient usage. Hu Huaichen’s view is the same.\nThe *Shiwen* states: *Zheng* is pronounced *xing*.\n\nHe delighted his ears and eyes, gratified his nose and mouth, and his complexion became parched and sallow.\n\n**[Annotation]** \"焦\" (*jiao*, parched) appears as \"燋\" (*jiao*) in the *Shide Tang* edition.\nThe *Shiwen* states: \"焦\" is written as \"燋,\" pronounced *jiao*. *Jise* (complexion) also appears as *yanse* (countenance). *Gan* is pronounced *gu han*. □ is pronounced *mei*.\n\nNo character exists in other texts for this; the *Pi Cang* writes it as □, pronounced the same as *mei*, referring to wood damaged by rain that develops black speckles. *Gan* and □ are likewise. Qin Enfu states: □ does not appear in the *Shuowen*. □ is the vulgar form of *mei* (mildew) and should be written as *mei*. In the *Chuci*’s \"Yufu,\" Wang Yi’s annotation reads: \"sallow and mildewed, blackened.\"\n\nHis five emotions were dulled and confused in a stupor.\n\n**[Annotation]** Exerting the mind and intellect is insufficient to nourish one’s nature and life—it only parches the body.\n\n**[Exegesis]** People of the age all use sensory pleasures and rich foods to nourish their bodies; only those with abundance are deemed noble. Yet the sage knows this path is enough to harm life, and thus he is parched and discontent. The first chapter identifies the spirit as the master of life; the second aims to clarify the Dao for nurturing the body. Therefore, it first shows what the masses are submerged in, then gradually guides them forward.\n\nBo Jun’s note: Lu’s exegesis takes \"举代\" (*ju dai*, the whole age) as \"举世\" (*ju shi*, the whole world); below, \"代谓之君子\" (*dai wei zhi junzi*, the age calls them gentlemen) means \"世谓之君子\" (*shi wei zhi junzi*, the world calls them gentlemen). Emperor Taizong of Tang was named *Shimin*, so Tang scholars often replaced *shi* (world) with *dai* (age).\n\nFifteen years later, he worried over the world’s lack of order.\n\n**[Annotation]** He worried in step with the world.\n\nThe *Shiwen* states: *zhi* (order) is pronounced *zhili*; below, *zhizhi* (order) is the same.\n\nHaving exhausted their keen hearing and sharp sight, exerted their wisdom and strength—*Shiwen* reads \"进智\" (*jin zhi*, advance governance) as \"进治\" (*jin zhi*, advance order), noting *jin* is pronounced *jin*—they toil for the common folk, their complexions parched and sallow, their five senses dulled and confused.\n\n**[Annotation]** The use of keen hearing and sharp sight is insufficient to bring order; it only serves to disorder the spirit.\n\n**[Exegesis]** The age calls them gentlemen—those who govern others. All wear themselves out in life, torment their own bodies, sacrifice themselves for external things, seeking fame and pursuing profit. Yet they do not realize they exhaust their spirits to lose their true selves, drifting ever farther from the Dao. *Exegesis* of \"劳生\" (*lao sheng*, toil in life): Four editions read \"劳心\" (*lao xin*, toil in mind).\n\nThen the Yellow Emperor sighed in admiration—**[Annotation]** *赞* (*zan*) should be *叹* (*tan*, sigh). *Shiwen* notes *赞* is pronounced *tan*—and said, \"My errors run deep—**[Annotation]** *淫* (*yin*) should be *深* (*shen*, deep). *Shiwen* notes *淫* is pronounced *shen*—in nurturing my own self, the harm is thus; in governing the myriad things, the harm is thus.\"\n\n**[Annotation]** Only by acting without nurturing, indulging without governing, can one’s nature and life remain whole, and the world at peace.\n\n**[Exegesis]** *淫* (*yin*) means to lose the Way. All living things know to nurture themselves, selfishly preserving their lives, yet do not know that what gives life also leads to death. Those who grasp at benevolence and righteousness all know to sacrifice for fame and profit, selfishly displaying their abilities, yet do not know that this exhausts the spirit and harms life, leading to death. To sacrifice oneself for selfish ends is the way of the petty man; to aid others without selfishness is the way the age calls a gentleman. To turn good into evil, when measured externally, appears distinct; to seek fame at the cost of reality, when measured internally, is a loss for both. Thus, in clarifying the great Dao, both are equally rejected.\n\nWang Lai notes: In the *Exegesis*, after \"不知所生\" (*bu zhi suo sheng*, do not know that which gives life), the character \"以\" (*yi*, thereby) is missing. Also, \"伤生而知死也\" (*shang sheng er zhi si ye*, harms life and knows death) should read \"伤生而之死也\" (*shang sheng er zhi si ye*, harms life and thereby leads to death).\n\nThereupon, he relinquished the myriad affairs of state, abandoned his palace chambers—*宫* (*gong*): The Qin engraving and Lu’s *Exegesis* read *官* (*guan*, offices); the *Shide Tang* edition also reads *官*, which is incorrect. *Yulin* (79) and *Leiju* (11) correctly cite *宫*. *Shiwen* notes *舍* (*she*) is pronounced *she*—dismissed his attendants—*Shiwen* notes *去* (*qu*) is pronounced *qu*—removed the bells and suspended instruments—Wang Shumin notes: *彻* (*che*) is a loan for *撤* (*che*, remove). The *Shuowen* defines *撤* as \"to send forth,\" extended to mean \"to remove.\" *Shuchao* (12) and *Yulin* (79) both read *彻* as *撤*, with *撤* being the vulgar form of *撤*. *Shiwen* reads *悬* (*xuan*) as *县* (*xuan*), noting *县* is pronounced *xuan*—reduced the royal cuisine, and retired to dwell in seclusion in the Hall of the Great Court—*Shiwen* notes *间* (*jian*) is pronounced *xian*—where he purified his mind and disciplined his form—**[Annotation]** With the mind free of desire, the form naturally submits.\n\n*Shiwen* reads *斋* (*zhai*, purify) as *齐* (*qi*), noting *齐* is pronounced *zhai*, and the same below. For three months, he did not attend to governance.\n\n**[Exegesis]** To \"relinquish the myriad affairs\" does not mean to do nothing at all. Matters arise, and one responds like the four seasons. Thus it is said: \"What does Heaven say? The four seasons proceed, and the hundred things are born.\" Not to toil with anxious thoughts to chase empty fame, nor to scheme for ability across a thousand years, desiring to leave a fragrant name on bamboo and silk. Rather, one acts in obscurity, moved only by necessity. One does not exalt one’s own name, nor increase one’s desires, nor enrich one’s flavors, nor indulge in wanton sounds. The mind is purified and solemn; the body is withdrawn and subdued. \"Three months\" refers to a single season. Confucius said, \"For three months, Yan Hui did not stray from benevolence.\" This is the same. Selecting worthy talent and holding them accountable, rewarding and punishing without partiality—this is what it means not to attend to governance.\n\nIn waking slumber one dreams—[this signifies that] the ultimate principle cannot be sought through emotion, and so it is entrusted to dreams. The sage has no dreams. One wanders in the land of Huaxu. The land of Huaxu lies west of Yan Prefecture and north of Tai Prefecture—[this does not mean such a land necessarily exists; it merely illustrates that the ultimate principle must be thus]. *Huainanzi* states: \"Due west is called Yan Prefecture; northwest is called Tai Prefecture.\" [Lu] Bojun notes: The commentary cites *Huainanzi* from the \"Treatise on Topography.\" *Shiwen* reads: *Yan* is pronounced *yan*. One knows not how many thousands or tens of thousands of *li* this land is distant—[the note explains:] *Si* means \"apart\"; *qi* means \"center.\" *Leiju* 11 and *Tianzhongji* 23 both quote \"apart\" as \"distance,\" likely a conjectural emendation. *Shiwen* reads: *Ji* is pronounced *ji*. It is beyond the reach of boats, carriages, or the strength of feet, attainable only through spirit-wandering—[the note explains:] Boats, carriages, and the strength of feet are but the means of form. The spirit-way is indistinct and elusive, arriving without traversing.\n\nIn that land, there are no masters or elders. The *Shide Tang* edition writes \"master\" as \"commander.\" Yu Yue says: *Shiwen* notes that \"commander\" may also be written as \"master,\" and the latter should be followed. The *Rites of Zhou*, in the \"Office of the Grand Steward,\" states: \"With nine bonds one unites the people of the state,\" the second being \"elders who gain the people through nobility,\" and the third, \"masters who gain the people through worthiness.\" This is the meaning of \"masters and elders.\" That the land has no masters or elders shows there is no distinction between noble and base, worthy and foolish. If written as \"commanders and elders,\" it would only mean no distinction between noble and base, leaving the meaning incomplete. The Lu Chongxuan edition correctly writes \"masters and elders.\" Wang Chongmin says: Yu Yue’s argument is sound. The Northern Song edition and *Taiping Yulan* (79 and 397) both write \"master.\" *Shiwen* writes \"commander\" as \"master,\" noting: *Commander* is pronounced *shuai*; some write it as *master*. *Elder* is pronounced *zhang*. \"Commanders and elders\" means \"leaders and chiefs.\"\n\nAll is spontaneous and nothing more. Its people have no desires—*Shiwen* reads: *Desire* is pronounced *shi*. All is spontaneous and nothing more—[the note explains:] \"Spontaneous\" means not relying on externals. They do not know to delight in life, nor to loathe death, and so there are no premature deaths. They do not know to cherish themselves—*Shiwen* reads: *Oneself* is pronounced *ji*—nor to estrange others, and so there is no love or hatred. They do not know to turn their backs—*Shiwen* reads: *Back* is pronounced *pei*—nor to face forward, and so there is no benefit or harm—[the note explains:] In principle, there is no life or death, and so there is nothing to delight in or loathe; in principle, there is no love or hatred, and so there is nothing to cherish or estrange; in principle, there is no turning away or facing forward, and so there is no benefit or harm. They hold nothing in love or regret—Wang Chongmin says: *Regret* should be *hatred*, a scribal error. The preceding text states, \"They do not know to cherish themselves, nor to estrange others, and so there is no love or hatred,\" which this directly follows. If written as *regret*, it would not convey the meaning. *Taiping Yulan* 79 correctly writes *hatred*. Wang Shumin says: Fan Zhixu’s commentary reads, \"They hold nothing in love or hatred, and so their minds know nothing,\" indicating that the edition he saw also wrote *regret* as *hatred*. They hold nothing in fear or dread. They do not drown in water, nor burn in fire.\n\nThe axe’s blows bring no pain, the lashes no hurt—*Shiwen* notes: *Zhuo* is read as *zhuó*. *Tà* means \"to strike.\" The probing of fingers elicits no soreness or itch. [Commentary] One who has attained perfect harmony cannot be harmed by anything. Heat, drowning, pain, and itching arise only from self-importance and fear; the principles are explained in detail in the following chapter. *Xiao yang* refers to *suan xiao* (aching soreness); the meaning is found in the *Rites of Zhou*. Lu Wenchang says: In the commentary, the character *yang* in *xiao yang* is superfluous. The *xiao* in *suan xiao* should be written as *xuē* (to pare). Bo Jun notes: Zheng Xuan’s commentary to the *Rites of Zhou*, under \"Physician of Illnesses\" in the \"Offices of Heaven,\" states, \"*Xiao* means *suan xuē* (aching and paring),\" which is the basis for Lu’s interpretation. *Shiwen* notes: *Tī* is read as *tì*, meaning \"to scratch.\" *Xiao* is read as *xiāo*. *Yang* is read as *yǎng* (in the *yú liǎng* rhyme). *Xiao yang* means pain and itching. In the *Rites of Zhou*, spring brings the illness of *xiao* in the head, and summer brings the itching scabies. Zheng Xuan says: \"*Xiao* means *suan xuē* (aching and paring).\" The *Shuowen* states: \"*Suan* means aching pain.\" *Jiàn* is read as *xiàn biàn*. Ren Dachun says: The *Shuowen* contains the character *xiao*, read as *xiāo* (in the *xiāng yāo* rhyme), and defines it as *suan xiao* (aching pain in the head), with the phonetic *xiao*. However, it does not contain the character *suan*. Jing Shun’s *Shiwen* cites the *Shuowen* as writing *suan* and defining it as \"aching pain.\" This passage does not appear in the current *Shuowen*. Consulting the *Yupian*, *suan* is read as *xiān wán* and means \"aching pain.\" Jing Shun thus mistakenly cited the *Yupian* as the *Shuowen*.\n\nThey tread upon emptiness as if walking on solid ground, and lie in the void as if resting on a bed. Clouds and mist do not obstruct their vision—Hu Huaichen says: *Jù* means \"to hinder.\" Duan Yucai’s commentary to the *Shuowen* on the character *ài* (to obstruct) states that the *Liezi* writes it as *jù*, which is correct. Xu Weiyu says: *Jù* is interchangeable with *hé* (to block). *Shiwen* notes: *Jù* is read as *wǔ gài*. Thunder does not confuse their hearing—*Shiwen* notes: *Tíng* is read as *tíng*. Beauty and ugliness do not disturb their minds—Wang Shumin says: The *Taiping Yulan* (79) writes *gǔ* (to disturb) as *gǔ* (to sink). Fan Zhixu’s commentary reads, \"With the heart hollowed out, nothing can sink it,\" indicating that the edition he saw also wrote it as *gǔ*. *Gǔ* and *gǔ* were interchangeable in antiquity. The *Zhuangzi* (\"Equalizing Things\") states, \"Set aside its *gǔ hūn*,\" and the *Shiwen* cites Xiang Xiu as writing *gǔ* as *gǔ*. The *Xunzi* (\"Chengxiang\") states, \"Officials carefully guide them without *pī gǔ*,\" and the commentary notes, \"*Gǔ* is interchangeable with *gǔ*,\" which serves as a parallel. *Shiwen* notes: *Gǔ* is read as *gǔ*. Mountains do not trip their steps—*Shiwen* notes: *Zhì* is read as *zhì*. Their spirit moves as it wills. [Commentary] One who has attained perfect compliance cannot be opposed by anything.\n\n[Exegesis] This is metaphorical language. By purifying the mind and disciplining the body, the spirit unites with the Dao, and one attains the great state. The spirit is the master of life. As the master of life, if one employs the spirit to nurture life but does so improperly, it instead becomes harmful. The common folk regard indulging desires as nurturing life, but this is precisely the root of shortening one’s years. Thus, the noble person nurtures their nature, while the petty person nurtures their emotions. To nurture one’s nature is to have no desires, to preserve naturalness, to take no joy in life, to feel no aversion to death, to have no inclinations or aversions, no loves or hatreds, no fears or dreads—all is natural. When the spirit moves, it is the spirit uniting with the Dao. This does not refer to a separate state or a different kind of person. Thus it is said: The Dao of benevolence is not distant; to practice it is to attain it. Those who meet in a single word grasp it as if clasping arms in mutual understanding.\n\nAfter awakening, the Yellow Emperor—[Commentary] This too is metaphorical, referring to waking and sleeping; the sage has no distinction between waking and sleeping—felt joyful and at ease. *Yí* in the *Shide Tang* edition is written as *wù*. Wang Chongmin says: The version with *yí* is closer to correct. The Northern Song edition, the Jifu edition, and the *Taiping Yulan* (397) all write it as *yí*. Bo Jun notes: The Qin-dynasty Lu commentary edition also writes it as *yí*. The version with *wù* is a scribal error. *Shiwen* notes: *Yí* is read as *yǔ zhī*. He summoned Tian Lao, Li Mu, and Tai Shan Ji—[Commentary] These three were the Yellow Emperor’s ministers. Lu Wenchang says: In the *Zang* edition, *Tai* is written as *Da*. The *Shiwen* writes *Tai* as *Da*, noting: *Da* is read as *tài*. *Ji* is read as *jī*. The *Hanshu* states: Da Shan Ji was the Yellow Emperor’s teacher. *Xiàng* is read as *xī liàng*. Ren Dachun says: The *Lushi Qianji* records that Da Tian was the Yellow Emperor’s teacher and Da Shan Ji was his Minister of Education. The Tang Bohai clan was surnamed Da. The pronunciation of Da Shan Ji as *Tài* is incorrect. Consulting the *Guangyun* (14, *Tai* rhyme), under the character *da*, the compound surnames listed include Da Hu Shi, Huang Yi Dafu Da Xin Zicheng, Qin General Da Luo Hong, Da Luo Shi, Da Ye Shi, and Da Shu Shi. If the *Lushi* is correct, then the *Guangyun*’s omission of Da Shan Ji before the compound surnames is an oversight. The *Xingshi Jijiu Pian* lists the Da clan, including Tang Bohai’s Da Zuorong and Da Menyi, and the Song’s Da Zhouren, which corroborates the *Lushi*’s claim that the Bohai clan was surnamed Da but does not mention Da Shan Ji.\n\nHe addressed them, saying: \"During my three months of leisurely retreat, I purified my mind and disciplined my body, seeking a way to nurture the self and govern things, but I have not obtained the method.\" [Commentary] The self cannot be nurtured, things cannot be governed, and yet one exhausts their spirit seeking it in vain.\n\nWeary, he fell asleep—*Shiwen* notes: \"The sentence ends here.\"—and dreamed thus. Now I know the supreme Dao cannot be sought through emotion. I have realized it! I have attained it! Yet I cannot convey it to you.\" [Commentary] If it cannot be sought through emotion, then it cannot be conveyed through emotion either.\n\nTwenty-eight years later—*Lushi Houji* 5 cites \"forty-eight years,\" while *Shiwen Leiju Houji* 21 gives \"twenty-nine years\"; *Shiwen* also notes an alternate version reading \"thirty-eight years\"—the world was greatly ordered, nearly resembling the realm of Huaxu. Then the Emperor ascended in transcendence. [Commentary] *Jia* should read *xia*. Bo Jun notes: *Liji Quli xia* states, \"To announce a death is called *tianwang dengjia*,\" where *jia* is also written as *xia*. *Dengjia* is a term for the death of an emperor, akin to \"ascending to heaven.\" *Shiwen* notes: *jia* is pronounced *xia*.\n\nThe people wailed for him—Bo Jun notes: *Zuozhuan Xuan 12* reads, \"*Hao* and sent him out,\" with the commentary: \"*Hao* means to weep.\" *Shiwen* notes: *hao* is pronounced *hudao*—and their lamentations continued unceasing for over two hundred years. [Exegesis] Once awakened to the Dao, he no longer relied on external things to attain it.\n\nWeary and falling asleep, one enters profound harmony with principle, leaving behind cravings and desires. The spirit of consciousness returns to its original nature, which cannot be sought through emotion. It cannot be conveyed to those who do not understand, for the mind is serene and words are forgotten.\n\nThose who govern the world through calculations and principles achieve only empty reputations. When calculations reach their limit, traces become visible, yet they remain hollow and cannot be substantiated. Superiors impose empty reputations upon their subordinates, and subordinates respond with empty reputations to their superiors—superiors and subordinates deceive one another, accumulating emptiness as governance. How then can one seek purity and simplicity?\n\nThe Dao is a spiritual resonance in accord with principle, responding to things with authenticity. It does not favor partial goodness in minor abilities, nor does it rage over small faults. Like the spreading of spring, all things grow. Customs shift and winds change, transforming naturally. One does not know how transformation occurs, nor perceives how things come to be. Thus, the people long for it without end.\n\nMount Lieguye lies amidst the sea and rivers. [Commentary] *See the* *Shanhaijing*. [Pronunciation] *Ye* is pronounced *she*. The *Shanhaijing* states: \"The state of Guye lies in the sea, encircled by the southwest. From the south of the state, traveling a hundred *li* by water is Mount Guye. Then, traveling three hundred and eighty *li* southwest is Mount Guye.\" Guo Pu notes: \"It is where the Yellow River flows into the sea.\" This describes gazing from afar at the rows of Guye Mountains situated between the sea and the rivers. According to the *Xiyu Zhuan*, the Yellow River flows east into the Puchang Sea, then courses underground into the Central States. The Puchang Sea is also called the Salt Marsh, located in Jiaohé Prefecture. [Pronunciation] *See* is pronounced *xian*. Qin Enfu notes: \"The *Shiwen* citation differs from the current edition of the *Shanhaijing*.\"\n\nThe *Shanhaijing* mentions Mount Guye in two instances. The *Eastern Mountains Classic* states: \"From Mount Luqi, traveling three hundred and eighty *li* south is Mount Guye, where no grasses or trees grow, but water abounds. Traveling another three hundred *li* south by water and a hundred *li* through flowing sands, one reaches North Mount Guye, where no grasses or trees grow, but stones are plentiful. Traveling another three hundred *li* south is South Mount Guye, where no grasses or trees grow, but water abounds.\" The *Classic of Regions Within the Seas: Northern Lands* states: \"West Mount Guye lies amid the isles of the sea and rivers.\" Guo Pu annotates: \"It is a mountain name. The mountain is inhabited by divine beings. The river isles lie within the sea, where the Yellow River flows—this is the Mount Guye of which Zhuangzi speaks as 'distant Mount Guye.'\" The *Classic* further states: \"The state of Guye lies in the sea, belonging to the array of Guye Mountains, encircled by mountains to the southwest.\"\n\nExamining the *Eastern Mountains Classic*, Mount Guye is located in Linfen County, as recorded in the *Geographical Treatises of the Sui Dynasty*—this is the present-day Nine-Aperture Mountain west of Pingyang Prefecture. There are no so-called North or South Mount Guye in its vicinity; thus, the two entries for North and South Mount Guye in the *Eastern Mountains Classic* should belong under the \"encircled by mountains to the southwest\" passage in the *Classic of Regions Within the Seas: Northern Lands*. Jing Shun’s cited *Shanhaijing* is a Tang-era edition, and his statement that \"the rows of Guye Mountains lie between the sea and the rivers\" particularly clarifies the meaning of the character *lie* (array). He further notes: \"This chapter aligns with the *Shanhaijing*; thus, the *Liezi*’s descriptions of 'breathing wind and drinking dew' and the like are also found in the *Shanhaijing*. The omissions and misplaced bamboo slips in the current edition are thereby evident.\"\n\nLater scholars, misled by Zhuangzi’s phrase \"distant Mount Guye north of the Fen River,\" assumed it referred to the Guye in Linfen. Bi Yuan, in his collated and published *Shanhaijing*, asserts under the \"array of Guye\" entry in the *Classic of Regions Within the Seas: Northern Lands* that Guye is in Shanxi and that Guo’s annotation erroneously cites Zhuangzi. Yet he fails to recognize that Zhuangzi’s \"distant Mount Guye, where divine beings dwell,\" aligns with the *Liezi*’s account—both undoubtedly refer to the array of Guye in the sea. As for Yao’s encounter with the Four Masters \"north of the Fen River on distant Mount Guye,\" this pertains to the Guye Mountain in Linfen, not the array of Guye Mountains. The contexts are entirely distinct; to hastily dismiss Jing Chun’s annotation as erroneous betrays a lack of thorough investigation. In the *Zhuangzi*, *lie* (array) is written as *miao* (distant). Lu’s *Pronunciations and Meanings* cites Jian Wen’s gloss: \"Miao means distant.\" The conflation of these two mountain names has persisted for ages, risking confusion for later learners—hence this detailed clarification.\n\nOn the mountain dwell divine beings—[Annotation] Serene and still, they are thus called divine beings. Lu’s *Pronunciations and Meanings* states: \"This chapter aligns with the *Shanhaijing*.\" They breathe wind and drink dew—[Pronunciation] *Xi* is pronounced *xie*. They do not eat the five grains—[Annotation] Having forsaken the five grains, why would they still need to breathe wind and drink dew? This describes the appearance of exhaling and inhaling, no different from other beings. Lu’s *Pronunciations and Meanings* states: *Fu* is pronounced *fuyou*. Their minds are like deep springs—[Pronunciation] The character *yuan* is read as *shen* (deep). Their forms are like maidens—[Annotation] Those who embody the utmost softness and emptiness possess a natural purity of countenance, unwaning without cultivation. Lu’s *Pronunciations and Meanings* states: *Cui* is pronounced *sui*. They are neither partial nor attached—[Annotation] *Wei* also means attachment. Like straw dogs to the myriad things, their kindness is impartial. *Wei* is pronounced *yinwei*. Lu’s *Pronunciations and Meanings* states: *Wei* is pronounced *wuhui*, meaning attachment. \"Neither partial nor attached\" suggests concealment or revelation. The *Shanhaijing* states: \"In the corner of the Northern Sea, its people dwell in water, partial and attached\"—this refers to concealment. The *Zilin* states: *Wei* means vaguely seen, indistinct. Bo Jun notes: The *Shuowen* defines *ai* as \"vague, indistinct,\" citing the *Book of Songs*: \"Vague and unseen.\" In the current *Book of Songs*, *ai* is written as *ai*. Here, *ai* is also borrowed for *ai*, hence Lu’s gloss as \"concealment.\" The *Shanhaijing*’s *Classic of Regions Within the Seas* states \"neither fearing nor attached,\" with Guo’s annotation: \"Fear also means attachment,\" following this precedent. They make immortals and sages their ministers—[Annotation] Immortals are the traces of long life;\n\n\"Sage\" is the designation for one who governs the age. Lu Wenchong notes: In the annotated *Zang* edition, there is a \"者\" after \"immortal,\" and likewise after \"sage.\"\n\n\"Neither fearing nor angered, the sincere and honest serve as their envoys.\" [Annotation] Fear here means awe. How could there be lord and subject, master and servant in such a state? Yet high and low, long and short, each accords with its proper place—this is but a borrowed designation.\n\n\"Neither bestowing nor conferring favor, yet all things are self-sufficient; neither amassing nor hoarding, yet there is no lack.\" [Annotation] *Qian* means deficiency. [Alternative note] One version reads \"蹇之\" instead of \"蹇乏,\" which is incorrect.\n\nThe *Shiwen* states: *Qian* is also written as *jian*, pronounced *quyan*.\n\nYin and yang remain ever in harmony, sun and moon ever bright; the four seasons ever compliant. [Annotation] *Ruo* means compliant. Wind and rain ever balanced. The *Shiwen* writes \"均\" as \"鈞,\" noting: *Jun* is pronounced *jun*.\n\nRen Dachun states: Examining the *Classic of Poetry*'s *Daya*: \"The four arrows are evenly matched,\" the *Book of Documents*' *Tai Shi*: \"Their crimes are equal,\" the *Zuo Tradition* under Duke Zhao's twenty-sixth year: \"Years are balanced by virtue, virtue by divination,\" the *Discourses of the States*' *Zhou Discourses*: \"In fine tuning, there are bells without *bo*; in grand tuning, there are *bo* without bells,\" and the *Strategies of the Warring States*' *Qin Strategies*: \"Equal to my regret,\" with the annotation \"鈞 means equal\"—thus *jun* and *jun* are interchangeable.\n\nAll creatures mature in due season, the harvests ever abundant; the earth knows no blight, people no premature death or misfortune, things no blemish or plague, and ghosts no numinous resonance. [Annotation] When heaven and humanity unite in virtue, yin and yang follow their proper order, dawn and dusk observe their measures, and calamities do not arise—thus the Dao harmonizes the Two Modes and accords with the Four Seasons. Laozi says: \"Those who govern the world by the Dao, their ghosts do not act as spirits.\"\n\n[Exegesis] This speaks of spirits aligning with the Dao, hence the analogy is drawn from the midst of what lies beyond form, and the designation of \"divine person\" is employed.\n\nThey do not rely on the five grains for sustenance, but ingest and exhale true *qi* to preserve wholeness. Their minds are like still water, undisturbed by waves; their forms like those of maidens, untroubled by thoughts or schemes. Joy and anger do not enter their hearts; right and wrong do not interfere with their function. Without seeking or desiring, they match heaven and earth in their non-benevolence; neither conferring nor bestowing, they rectify yin and yang in their generative power. Nothing in the myriad things can disturb them, nor can ghosts and spirits manifest their numinosity. When verified in truth, their achievement is thus.\n\nThe *Shiwen* glosses \"響\" as \"向,\" noting: *zhá* (札), *cè bā* cut. Zheng Zhong’s commentary on the *Zhouli* states: \"The Yue people call death *zhá*.\" The *Zuozhuan* says, \"People do not die prematurely (*yāo zhá*).\" *Cī* (疵), *cái yí* cut, means illness. *Lì* (厲) is pronounced *lì*. Zheng Zhong’s commentary on the *Zhouli* states: \"*Lì* is a disease caused by disharmony in the wind and *qi*.\" *Xiàng* (向) is pronounced *xiǎng*. Ren Dachun observes: \"In the *Xunzi*’s 'Encouraging Learning' chapter, 'The noble person is like *xiàng*,' Yang Liang’s commentary states, '*Xiàng* is the same as *xiǎng* (響), like an echo responding to sound.' Thus, *líng xiàng* is akin to *líng xiǎng*.\"\n\nLiezi studied under Master Lao Shang and befriended Bo Gaozi. Having mastered the Way of these two, he rode the wind and returned. [Annotation] Zhuangzi says, \"Liezi traveled by riding the wind, so effortlessly and skillfully that after fifteen days he returned.\" As a divine person, he was praised by Yu-kou. [Exegesis] When the spirit is mired in being, the hundred bones all suffer; when the spirit aligns with the true, the five senses all become unobstructed. With unobstructedness, nothing is too distant to perceive; without suffering, one rides the wind in motion. Those who don feathered garments to come and go, or take on scales and fur to leap and bound, do so as a matter of constant principle—not because they esteem the extraordinary, but because this is the meaning of the parable. [Annotation] \"泠\" in all other editions appears as \"冷,\" which is incorrect; here, it is corrected according to the *Zang* edition. Wang Chongmin notes: \"The annotation cites the *Xiaoyaoyou* chapter, where after 'fifteen' there is the word 'days'—likely omitted in the current edition of the *Liezi* commentary. The *Taiping Yulan* (vol. 9) quotes the annotation with 'days,' which should be restored.\" The *Shiwen* notes: *líng* is pronounced *líng*. *Chēng* (稱) is pronounced *chèn*.\n\nYin Sheng heard of this and lived with Liezi, yet for months he did not attend to his dwelling. The *Shiwen* notes: *shù* (數) is pronounced *sè zhǔ*; *xǐng* (省) is pronounced *xī jǐng*. He then seized an opportunity to request the transmission of his arts. The *Shiwen* notes: *jiàn* (間) is pronounced *jiàn*; *qí* (蕲) is pronounced *qí*. After ten requests, he was refused ten times. Yin Sheng, resentful, asked to take his leave. The *Shiwen* notes: *duì* (怼) is pronounced *zhuì*, meaning resentment. Liezi, however, gave no command. The *Shiwen* reads: \"又不與命,\" noting that one edition omits the character *yǔ* (與). Yin Sheng withdrew. Months later, his resolve unabated, he returned to follow Liezi once more.\n\nLiezi said, \"Why do you come and go so frequently?\" The *Shiwen* notes: *rǔ* (汝) is written as *nǚ* (女), pronounced *rǔ*. Yin Sheng replied, \"Formerly, Zhang Dai made requests of you.\" The annotation states: *Zhang Dai* is Yin Sheng’s name. Lu Wenchang notes: The annotation under Yin Sheng’s name in the Zang edition includes the character *zhī* (之). The *Shiwen* notes: *dài* (戴) is written as *zài* (载), and *nǎng* (曩) is pronounced *nǎng*. *Zhang Zai*’s courtesy name is *Zai Ze*; one edition writes *Zhang Dai*. \"You did not instruct me, so I naturally harbored resentment toward you. Now, my mind is suddenly at ease, which is why I have returned.\" Liezi said, \"Formerly, I took you for one who had attained understanding.\" The annotation states: *nǎng* means \"formerly.\" Wang Shumin notes: This annotation likely belongs below the earlier phrase *\"nǎng zhāng dài yǒu qǐng yú zǐ\"* (曩章戴有请于子). \"But has your vulgarity truly reached this point? Ji! I shall now tell you what I learned from the Master.\" The annotation states: *jī* (姬) means \"to reside.\" The *Shiwen* notes: *jī* is pronounced *jū*. The explanation states: When you left before, I thought you had grasped my Way. Now that you return to dispel your resentment, I know your shallowness. The explanation notes: The original text read *\"duì hàn\"* (怼憾), but this has been corrected to *\"xī hàn\"* (息憾) according to the *Sijie* edition. The *Shiwen* notes: *rǔ* (汝) is written as *nǚ* (女), pronounced *rǔ*.\n\n\"Since I began studying under the Master and befriended such a person—after three years, my mind dared not entertain thoughts of right and wrong, nor my mouth speak of profit and harm—I only then received a single glance from the Master.\" The annotation states: Though inwardly harboring thoughts of profit and harm, one dared not speak of them, concealing resentment and hiding true feelings. Thus, he merely glanced at me. The explanation states: One who is single-minded and unwavering, reverent and devoted, seeking to observe my form and emulate my conduct, receives only a sidelong glance. The *Shiwen* notes: *miǎn* (眄) is pronounced *miàn*. \"After five years, my mind *gēng* contemplated right and wrong, and my mouth *gēng* spoke of profit and harm.\" The annotation states: *Gēng* should be *gèng*. The *Jifu* edition writes *gèng* (更). The *Shiwen* notes: *gēng* is pronounced *gèng*, *jū xíng qiè*, meaning \"to increase\"; the same applies below. \"Only then did the Master smile once, relaxing his countenance.\" The annotation states: Right and wrong, profit and harm are the common principles of the world. Following the mind’s thoughts and the mouth’s words without restraint or hesitation in the heart, aligning inner and outer as one—is this not surpassing concealment and revealing all? Delighted by this unity, he playfully bestowed a smile. The explanation states: After three years, one was devoted to stillness, receiving only glances. After five years, surpassing devotion, his smile became evident. The Northern Song edition writes *mín* (忞) for *lìn* (吝), *chàng* (鬯) for *xiōng* (胸), and *xún* (循) for *yóu* (犹), all of which are incorrect and have been corrected here. The *Shide Tang* edition writes *jǐ* (己) for *nì* (匿), which is also incorrect. The *Shiwen* notes: *nì* is written as *jǐ* in one edition.\n\n\"After seven years, following the mind’s thoughts, *gēng* there was no right or wrong; following the mouth’s words, *gēng* there was no profit or harm. Only then did the Master draw me to sit beside him on the same mat.\" The annotation states: What is the mind? It is stillness without thought. What is the mouth? It is silence, naturally inhaling and exhaling. If one follows the mind’s utmost, there is no right or wrong; if one follows the mouth’s principle, there is no profit or harm. When the Dao harmonizes with teacher and friend, sharing the same position side by side, it is fitting. The explanation states: One speaks only after careful consideration, ensuring no error in right or wrong, profit or harm. The *Shiwen* notes: *qì* (契) is pronounced *kǔ jì qiè*. \"After nine years, freely following the mind’s thoughts, freely speaking the mouth’s words, I no longer knew whether my own right and wrong, profit and harm existed, nor whether the Master was my teacher or such a person my friend. Inner and outer had reached perfection.\" The annotation states: With the mind devoid of thought and the mouth free of contradiction, one can indulge the mind’s thoughts and give free rein to the mouth’s words. Having mastered the Dao and exhausted its essence, one becomes a bridge for the world. Though thoughts arise all day, they are not my thoughts; though words are spoken all day, they are not my words. If one takes non-thought as thought and non-speech as speech, one has not yet reached the ultimate. The so-called \"non-action that leaves nothing undone\" is like this. Then where can one seek the difference between self and other? Where can the relationship between teacher and student be applied? Thus, it is said that inner and outer are complete. The explanation states: With the mind utterly empty, right and wrong, profit and harm are spoken without distinction—this is freedom. Following the mind’s freedom in speech, all aligns with the Dao. The *Shiwen* notes: *zào* (造) is pronounced *qī dào qiè*.\n\n\"Afterward, eyes were like ears, ears like noses, noses like mouths—none were different.\" The explanation states: Eyes, ears, mouth, and nose did not use their respective functions but acted without intention, thus none were different. \"The mind congealed, the form dissolved, bones and flesh fused entirely. Unaware of where the body leaned,\" the *Shiwen* notes: *yǐ* (倚) is pronounced *yú qǐ qiè*, \"or where the feet trod, I drifted east and west with the wind like a withered leaf or a dried husk.\" Shen Tao notes: Dai Tong’s *Liu Shu Gu* cites the Tang edition of the *Shuowen*, saying *gān* (干) is the original character for dryness, interchangeable with *gān* (乾). The Xu edition omits *gān*. Tao’s note: *Gān* is the proper character for dryness, interchangeable with *gān*. The *Liezi Huangdi* chapter’s \"withered leaf or dried husk,\" with Zhang Zhan’s annotation (note: should be *Shiwen*), *gān* pronounced *gān*, serves as evidence. The *Shiwen* notes: *gān* is pronounced *gān*, and *ké* (壳) is pronounced *kǒu jiǎo qiè*. \"Did the wind ride me, or did I ride the wind?\" The annotation states: Eyes, ears, nose, and mouth each have their respective functions.\n\nLet the spirit congeal and the form dissolve, no longer dependent on externals—then sight and hearing do not rely on eyes and ears, nor do scent and taste depend on nose and mouth. Thus, the six viscera and seven orifices, the four limbs and hundred joints, lie inert as a corpse, all reduced to one thing. Where then does the form lean? Where do the feet tread? Whether I ride the wind or the wind rides me—who can distinguish?\n\n**[Annotation]** *\"Spirit congeals\"* means immobility; *\"form dissolves\"* means no obstruction; *\"flesh and bone wholly melt\"* means forgetting the bodily frame. When the bodily frame is forgotten in its movements and the spirit’s thoughts detach from their attachments, one ascends and descends with the wind and qi as one.\n\nLu Wenchang notes: The annotation reads *\"令神凝形废\"* (\"let the spirit congeal and the form dissolve\"), but *\"令\"* should be *\"今\"* (\"now\"). *\"Now you have entered the Master’s gate, yet before even a full cycle of time has passed\"*—*Shiwen* notes: *\"曾\"* is pronounced *céng*; *\"浃\"* is pronounced *zié*. *\"You have repeatedly expressed resentment and regret. Your entire body will not be borne by qi, nor will even a single part of you be supported by the earth.\"*\n\n**[Annotation]** To employ one’s emotions and possess a self is to make flesh and bone incompatible—where then can the body reside? How could the two forces of heaven and earth sustain it? *\"将\"* means *\"且\"* (\"about to\"). To tread the void and ride the wind—how could this be possible?\n\n*Shiwen* notes: *\"几\"* is pronounced *jī*. Yin Sheng was deeply ashamed. *Shiwen* notes: *\"怍\"* is pronounced *zuò*. He held his breath for a long while—*Shiwen* notes: *\"屏息\"* means to hold one’s breath as if not breathing—and dared not speak again.\n\n**[Annotation]** The reason *Liezi* could ride the wind was that he was able to forget his body.\n\nLaozi said: *\"My great affliction arises from having a body; if I were without a body, what affliction could I have?\"* If one cannot forget the form and bones, then even the weight of a single joint would be more than the earth could bear—how then could one find leisure to ride the wind and tread the void?\n\n**[Annotation]** The *Exegesis* cites Laozi’s *\"what affliction could I have?\"*—the present text omits the character *\"也\"*. *Shiwen* notes: *\"复\"* is pronounced *fù*. Liezi asked Guan Yin: *Shiwen* notes: Guan Yin was Guan Ling Yin Xi, styled Gongdu, who wrote nine chapters. **[Annotation]** The present *Guan Yinzi* consists of one scroll and nine chapters; Chen Zhensun of the Southern Song, in his *Zhizhai shulu jieti*, suspected it to be a forgery by Sun Ding (a Southern Song figure), while the *Siku quanshu* *tiyao* suggests it may have been composed by a Tang or Five Dynasties Daoist versed in literary arts.\n\n*\"The perfected person moves through water without obstruction—[Annotation] 'Without obstruction' means 'substantially present.' The perfected person’s movements and stillness are not hindered by substantial presence.\"* Guo Xiang said: *\"Their mind is empty, thus they can master all that is substantial.\"* The *Daozang* Jiang Yu edition and the Song Huizong edition both write *\"窒\"* instead of *\"空\"*—*\"窒\"* is correct. However, Zhang Zhan’s original text reads *\"空\"*, so it is retained here. Yu Yue said: Zhang’s annotation is overly convoluted. *Shiwen* states: *\"空, one version writes 窒\"*—this should be followed. The *Zhuangzi* *\"Da Sheng\"* chapter indeed reads *\"不窒\"*. **[Annotation]** Master Zhongfu said: Yu Yue’s view is correct. *\"潜行\"* refers to moving through water. The *Shuowen*, in the water section of its eleventh chapter, states: *\"泳 means to move submerged in water.\"* The *Zuozhuan* of the seventeenth year of Duke Ai records: *\"The Viscount of Yue led his three armies to cross the river in secret.\"* The *Hanfeizi* *\"Shi Guo\"* chapter recounts the siege of Zhao by Zhi Bo: *\"He breached the dikes of Jinyang to flood the city, besieging it for three years. Within the city, people nested in trees and cooked in suspended cauldrons. Zhang Mengtan said to Viscount Xiang of Zhao: 'I request to attempt a secret crossing to meet with the lords of Han and Wei.'\"*—all these serve as evidence. *\"窒\"* means suffocation; moving through water and entering fire are directly opposed. *Shiwen* notes: *\"潜\"* is sometimes written *\"渐\"*, also pronounced *qián*. *\"空\"* is written as *\"窒\"* in one version, meaning blockage. *\"阂\"* is pronounced *ài*. Qin Enfu said: In the *Yi*, *\"阒其无人\"*, Lu’s *Shiwen* notes: Meng’s version writes *\"窒\"*. Yu Fan’s commentary: *\"Empty.\"* *\"空\"* as *\"窒\"* is like *\"乱\"* glossed as *\"治\"*.\n\n*\"They tread fire without being burned, walk atop the myriad things without trembling. May I ask how one attains this?\"* Guan Yin replied: *\"This is the preservation of pure qi, not a matter of cunning, skill, or daring.\"* **[Annotation]** Utmost purity and truth are inherent in one’s nature, not sought externally. Guarding it without loss renders one invulnerable to harm—how could this be achieved through calculated bravery or reckless exposure to peril?\n\n**[Exegesis]** The perfected person’s movement through water is the accumulation of virtue, not based on emptiness—how then can they tread fire without being burned or ascend heights without trembling? This clarifies that pure qi emerges from nature; preserving spirit to align with the Dao enables such attainment. Thus, they are called perfected persons—how could this be achieved through cunning, skill, or daring? *Shiwen* notes: *\"列\"* is pronounced *liè*. *\"姬!\"* *Shiwen* notes: *\"姬\"* is pronounced *jī*. *\"Fish speaks to you.\"* **[Annotation]** *\"鱼\"* should be *\"吾\"*. Wu Kaisheng said: In ancient bronze inscriptions, *\"鱼\"* often stands for *\"吾\"*. *Shiwen* notes: *\"鱼\"* is pronounced *wú*. *\"语\"* is pronounced *yù*. *\"女\"* is pronounced *rǔ*.\n\n*\"All that possesses form, appearance, sound, or color is 'thing.'\"* **[Annotation]** From sages above to insects below, all are beings of form and sound. Observing them through form and sound reveals no absolute distinction. How then can things be far removed from one another? **[Annotation]** Xiang Xiu said: Only the mindless are truly distant. *Shiwen* notes: *\"远\"* is pronounced *yuàn*.\n\n*\"Why should any be deemed prior? They are but form and color.\"* **[Annotation]** Xiang Xiu said: All are beings of form and color—none are inherently prior. That which precedes them is only spontaneity. **[Exegesis]** All that has form is \"thing.\" All things are color—what comes after or before? Yet those who arbitrarily rank things in value are deeply deluded. Only by forgetting form, preserving spirit, cultivating stillness to generate wisdom, and thereby communing with the divine can one attain this. **[Annotation]** The character *\"形\"* is missing before *\"色\"*—it should read *\"是形色而已\"*. *\"形色\"* refers back to the earlier *\"貌像声色\"*. The annotation cites Xiang Xiu: *\"All are beings of form and color\"*—thus Xiang’s version of the *Zhuangzi* included *\"形\"*. The Jiangnan ancient *Zhuangzi* text indeed reads *\"是形色而已\"*, which should be adopted as correct. This follows Xi Tong’s *Zhuangzi Buzhu*.\n\n*\"Thus, things originate in the formless and rest where there is no transformation.\"* **[Annotation]** If existence has no beginning, then that which it creates is formless; if form has no end, then that which it rests in is unchanging. *\"造\"* is pronounced *zuò*. Lu Wenchang said: The annotation should include another *\"造\"* after *\"造音\"*. **[Annotation]** Lu’s suggestion is debatable. According to *Shiwen*, Zhang’s annotation only reads *\"造音作\"*. Zhang Zhan and Yin Jingshun both lacked understanding of phonetics, so their pronunciations are not always reliable and should not be over-scrutinized. *Shiwen* notes: *\"造\"* is pronounced *zuò*, *zàng zuò* cut, same as the annotation.\n\n*\"One who attains this and exhausts it—how could they be corrected?\"* *Shiwen* notes: *\"焉\"* is pronounced *yán*. *\"得而正焉?\"*\n\n**[Annotation]** Those who seek to trace form and sound to exhaust their beginnings and ends—how could they ever reach the ultimate destination?\n\n**[Exegesis]** Forgetting form and preserving spirit, one attains the formless; treasuring authenticity and uniting with the Dao, one rests where there is no transformation. If one attains this Dao and exhausts principle to fulfill one’s nature, how could they not be correct?\n\n*\"And be correct\"* originally read *\"become correct.\"* Yu Yue said: *\"Become correct\"* should be *\"and rest,\"* a scribal error. *\"Rest\"* and *\"correct\"* resemble each other in form, while *\"become\"* in ancient script (□) also resembles *\"and.\"* The *Zuozhuan* (Year 14 of Duke Xiang) reads: *\"Is archery ritual?\"*—the *Taiping Yulan*’s *Jiju* section quotes it as *\"Is archery and ritual?\"* The *Mencius* (*Teng Wen Gong*) reads: *\"A square li forms a well,\"*—the *Lunyu* (*Yan Yuan*) *Zhengyi* quotes it as *\"A square li becomes a well,\"* both serving as evidence. The *Zhuangzi* (*Da Sheng*) cites this passage as: *\"One who attains this and exhausts it—how could things restrain them?\"*—this may be used to emend the text. Wang Chongmin said: The Jifu edition reads *\"become\"* as *\"and.\"* Lu’s note: Yu and Wang’s arguments are sound. The *\"become\"* is here corrected to *\"and\"* following the Jifu edition.\n\nThey will abide in measure without excess,\n**[Annotation]** Those who, upon encountering form and color, do not seek their beginnings and ends do not lose the correctness of nature.\n*\"Excess\"* should be *\"indulgence.\"* *Shiwen* notes: *\"Excess\"* is pronounced *yin.*\n\nAnd conceal themselves in the traceless principle,\n**[Annotation]** How could the ultimate principle be concealed? Acting without attachment, it is obscure and without trace, its boundaries unseen.\n*Shiwen* notes: *\"Seen\"* is pronounced *xiàn.*\n\nWandering where the myriad things begin and end.\n**[Annotation]** Those who ride principle without intention always wander alongside the myriad things—how could they lack traces of beginning and end?\n\n**[Exegesis]** The perfected person speaks without losing virtue, thus not indulging their measure; acts without losing trace, thus concealing themselves in the traceless; constantly returns to their root, thus wandering the beginnings and ends of the myriad things.\nLu’s note: *\"Principle\"* and *\"begin\"* rhyme, both belonging to the *zhi* group’s rising tone in ancient phonology.\n\nUnifying their nature, nurturing their *qi,*\n*Shiwen* notes: *\"Nurturing their qi\"* in one version reads *\"authenticating their qi.\"*\n\nEmbracing their virtue, to connect with that which things create.\n**[Annotation]** Those whose *qi* is unified and virtue pure—how could they merely connect with themselves? Wherever things reach, they ensure no obstruction, thereby universally aiding all beings.\n*\"Create\"* is pronounced *cāo.*\n\n**[Exegesis]** When nature is not disordered, it is solely authentic, uniting virtue with heaven and earth to connect with the nature and destiny of the myriad things.\nLu Wenchang said: At the end of Zhang’s annotation, the Zang edition includes the character *\"you\"* after *\"pronounced cāo.\"*\n*Shiwen* notes: *\"Create\"* is pronounced *cāo* (seven *dào* cut), meaning *\"to reach.\"*\n\nOne such as this preserves their heavenly endowment whole, their spirit without gap.\n*\"Gap\"*—*Shiwen* writes *\"郤,\"* noting: *\"郤\"* is pronounced *xì,* meaning *\"interval.\"*\nYu Yue said: *Shiwen*’s *\"interval\"* is an error for *\"crevice,\"* referring to a fissure. *\"郤\"* and *\"隙\"* are interchangeable. The *Zhuangzi* (*Zhi Bei You*) reads: *\"Like a white colt passing through a gap,\"*—*Shiwen* notes: *\"Gap\"* originally read *\"隙,\"* confirming this. Thus *\"郤\"* carries the meaning of *\"crevice.\"* The *Liji* (*Qu Li*) reads: *\"Meeting in a gap is called a gathering,\"*—Zheng Xuan’s commentary: *\"郤* means *interval.\"* The *Zhuangzi* (*Yang Sheng Zhu*) reads: *\"Striking the great gap,\"* and (*De Chong Fu*) *\"causing day and night to have no gap,\"*—*Shiwen* cites Cui and Li: *\"郤* means *interval,\"* all serving as evidence.\n\nHow could things enter them?\n**[Annotation]** When one’s allotted nature remains unharmed, form and spirit are whole and unified—how could sorrow and disaster enter?\n**[Exegesis]** Treasuring the Dao preserves one’s nature; eliminating emotion leaves no gap, no sign, no trace—how could external things enter?\n\nWhen a drunkard falls from a carriage,\n*Shiwen* writes *\"falls\"* as *\"队,\"* noting: *\"队\"* is pronounced *zhuì.*\n\nThough swift, they do not die. Their bones and joints are the same as others’, yet the harm they suffer differs—because their spirit is whole. They neither know they are riding nor know they have fallen.\n**[Annotation]** This borrows the coarse to clarify the inevitable truth of the ultimate principle.\n*Shiwen* notes: *\"Riding\"* is pronounced *shèng.*\n\nDeath and life, alarm and fear do not enter their breast, thus they encounter things without trembling.\n**[Annotation]** Xiang Xiu said: They meet without terror.\n*\"Encounter\"*—the Qin engraving’s Lu exegesis reads *\"忤.\"*\nQin Enfu said: *\"\"* and *\"忤\"* are interchangeable characters.\n*Shiwen* notes: *\"遌\"* is pronounced *wǔ,* meaning *\"encounter.\"* One version reads *\",\"* glossed as *\"seeing what one does not wish to see,\"* which is rather forced. The *Zhuangzi* also writes *\".\"*\n*\"Trembling\"* is pronounced *zhé.*\n\nIf one can be whole through wine and yet be thus,\n**[Annotation]** Xiang Xiu said: Drunkenness causes them to lose what they know—this is not the natural absence of intention.\n\nHow much more so for one whole through heaven?\n**[Annotation]** Xiang Xiu said: One whole through heaven naturally lacks intention, submitting to the ultimate principle.\n\nThe sage conceals themselves in heaven, thus nothing can harm them.\n**[Annotation]** Guo Xiang said: Not peering beyond the bounds of one’s nature is called *\"concealing.\"*\n*Shiwen* notes: *\"Peering\"* is pronounced *kuī.*\n\n**[Exegesis]** The drunkard’s spirit is not united with the Dao—they are merely preserved by wine, so alarm and fear do not enter their heavenly storehouse, and death and life do not harm their form and spirit. If one is whole through spirit, then things cannot harm them.\n\nLie Yukou shot for Bo Hun Wuren,\n*Shiwen* writes *\"Wuren\"* as *\"Wu,\"* noting: *\"For\"* is pronounced *wèi;* *\"Wu\"* is pronounced *móu,* and so on below.\n\nDrawing the bow to its fullest,\n**[Annotation]** Exhausting the string and piercing the arrowhead.\n*Shiwen* notes: *\"Arrowhead\"* is pronounced *dí.*\n\nHe placed a cup of water on his elbow—\n**[Annotation]** The hand remained steady, so the cup of water did not spill.\n**[Note]** The character *\"gu\"* (故) in four *jie* editions appears as *\"gu\"* (固), which is incorrect.\n*Shiwen* notes: *\"Cup\"* is pronounced *bēi;* *\"elbow\"* is pronounced *zhǒu.*\n\nHe loosed the arrow, and the arrowhead returned in succession—\n**[Annotation]** Guo Xiang said: The arrow had departed.\nThe arrowhead, once loosed, returned in sequence.\n*Shiwen* writes *\"dí\"* (镝) as *\"zhāi\"* (摘), noting: *\"Zhāi\"* is pronounced *dí,* originally written as *\"dí\"* (镝). *\"Returned\"* is pronounced *fù;* *\"succession\"* is pronounced *tà.*\n\nThe arrow just loosed still lingered—\n**[Annotation]** Guo Xiang said: As the arrow had just departed and not yet reached the target, it again rested upon the cup on the elbow—this speaks to the marvel of swiftness.\nXi Xiong said: The *Shuowen* states: *\"Dí\"* (镝) is the tip of an arrow. The *Xiao Erya* says: *\"Tà\"* (沓) means *\"to join.\"* The *Chu Ci*’s *\"Tian Wen\"* asks, *\"Where does Heaven join?\"* Wang Yi’s commentary: *\"Tà\"* means *\"to join.\"* The *Book of Songs*’ *\"Qin Feng\"* reads: *\"When shall we meet again?\"* Zheng Xuan’s commentary: *\"Now, at what time shall we set the date of return?\"*—thus *\"fāng\"* (方) carries the sense of *\"now.\"* *\"Fā zhi dí shǐ fù tà\"* (发之镝矢复沓) means that the loosed arrowhead and shaft join in sequence. *\"Fāng shǐ\"* (方矢) refers to the arrow of the present moment, one drawn but not yet loosed. In contrast to the loosed arrow, the unloosed one is the *\"now-arrow\"*; yet in terms of sequence, the *\"now-arrow\"* becomes the later arrow. *\"Fāng shǐ fù yù\"* (方矢复寓) means the later arrow again rests upon the string. The *\"Zhongni\"* chapter states: *\"A skilled archer can make the rear arrow’s head strike the front arrow’s nock, each shot following the last, each arrow linking to the next. The front arrow reaches the mark without falling, while the nock of the rear arrow still holds the string—seen from afar, they appear as one.\"* This passage may be applied to explain the present text.\n*Shiwen* notes: *\"Yù\"* (寓) is pronounced *yù;* *\"swiftness\"* is pronounced *jié.*\n\nAt that moment, he resembled a wooden figure—\n**[Exegesis]** Drawing the bow to full tension and placing water upon his elbow, he loosed one arrow after another in succession, like a clay or wooden effigy. His will was focused, his spirit settled, his form unmoving—thus he achieved this feat.\n*Shiwen* notes: A wooden puppet is called a *\"xiàngrén\"* (象人).\n\nBo Hun Wuren said: \"This is the shooting of one who shoots—\n**[Annotation]** Though he has mastered the principles of shooting, he cannot help but take pride in his skill.\nIt is not the shooting of one who does not shoot—\n**[Annotation]** Forgetting success or failure, though not shooting, he is one with shooting.\n\nLet us ascend a high mountain, tread upon perilous rocks, and stand at the edge of an abyss a hundred *ren* deep—could you still shoot then?\"\n**[Annotation]** If one harbors fear within, one loses their skill in shooting.\n**[Exegesis]** Relying on one’s ability and feeling secure in form and aim is not the same as forgetting form, relinquishing things, and moving with spirit.\n\n**[Bo Jun’s Note]** *\"Dāng\"* (当) should be *\"tǎng\"* (傥), meaning *\"if\"* or *\"as.\"* The *Han Feizi*’s *\"Ren Zhu\"* chapter states: *\"If tigers and leopards were to lose their claws and fangs, men would surely subdue them\"*—here, *\"dāng\"* is likewise *\"tǎng,\"* providing evidence.\n\nThereupon, Wuren ascended the high mountain, trod upon perilous rocks, and stood at the edge of an abyss a hundred *ren* deep. Turning his back, he retreated hesitantly, with two parts of his feet dangling over the edge.\n*Shiwen* notes: *\"Qūn\"* (逡) is pronounced *qūn;* *\"two parts dangling\"* means two parts of the feet hung suspended over the void.\n\nHe beckoned Lie Yukou forward. Yukou prostrated himself on the ground, sweat streaming down to his heels.\n**[Exegesis]** Ascending heights and treading peril, he feared thus because he cherished his body and clung to life. Little did he know that attachment to form is precisely what harms life, while forgetting form is what fulfills it. Yukou was merely skilled in shooting, not one with the Dao. Only one who forgets form, preserves spirit, and bears no burden in the world embodies the shooting of one who does not shoot.\n*Shiwen* notes: *\"Heel\"* is pronounced *zhǒng.*\n\nBo Hun Wuren said: \"The perfected person—\ngazes upward into the blue sky, plunges downward into the Yellow Springs, roams to the eight limits,\n*Shiwen* notes: *\"Chì\"* (斥) is pronounced *chǐ.*\nGuo Xiang said: *\"Huīchì\"* (挥斥) means *\"to roam freely.\"*\nHe also said: *\"Huīchì\"* means *\"vigorous and swift.\"*\nTheir spirit and qi remain unaltered—\n**[Annotation]** Guo Xiang said: *\"Huīchì\"* means *\"to roam freely.\"* When virtue fills the inner self, spirit overflows externally. No matter how distant, deep, or obscure, all is illuminated—thus one discerns the mechanisms of safety and danger yet rests in serene self-possession.\n**[Note]** The character *\"yuē\"* (曰) in Wang’s edition appears as *\"yún\"* (云); here, it is corrected according to the Northern Song and *Zang* editions.\n\nNow you startle with fear, your eyes darting—\n**[Qin Enfu’s Note]** *\"Xún\"* (恂) should be *\"shùn\"* ().\n*Shiwen* notes: *\"Chù\"* (怵) is pronounced *chù;* *\"xún\"* (恂) is pronounced *xún.*\nThe *Zuan Yao* by He Chengtian states: The people of Wu call blinking *\"xúnmù\"* (恂目).\n\nHow perilous your inner state has become!\"\n**[Annotation]** Guo Xiang said: Failing to grasp the ultimate principle, one is beset by fear and loses much—how could this apply only to shooting?\n**[Exegesis]** The person of the utmost Dao is self-possessed between Heaven and Earth, their spirit and qi sovereign. Joy and sorrow cannot enter. Now you tremble with such fear—how could this be near the Dao? You have merely begun to learn, yet have not attained its marvel.\"\n\nXu Diao said: *Zhi* (志) is the character *shi* (识), meaning \"mark\" or \"sign\"—as in being outwardly manifest. *Zhong* (中) is read as written, meaning \"within the heart.\" As in the *Li Wen Wang Shi Zi* under the *Li Ji*, where Zheng Xuan’s note states: \"Zhong means within the heart.\"\n\nWang Shumin said: Zhang’s commentary cites Guo Xiang’s text, where the *Zhuangzi* \"Tian Zifang\" chapter’s note repeats the phrase *\"you ju\"* (有惧, \"with fear\"). This should be followed. The present text omits *\"you ju\"*, leaving the meaning incomplete.\n\n*Shiwen* notes: *Zhong* is pronounced *ding zhong* (丁仲切).\n\n*\"Dai yi fu\"* (殆矣夫) in one version reads *\"shi yi fu\"* (始矣夫).\n\nFan had a son named Zihua, who was skilled at cultivating a private reputation.\n**[Annotation]** A knight-errant.\n\nThe *Wen Xuan*’s commentary on Lu Ji’s *\"Nigu Shi\"* includes a *\"Jin\"* (晋) before *\"Fan shi\"* (范氏).\n\nXu Weiyu said: *\"Ming\"* (名, \"name\") is likely a corruption of *\"ke\"* (客, \"guest\"). The annotation—\"a knight-errant\"—makes it clear the original text read *\"ke.\"*\n\nFurthermore, the following line—*\"Zihua sent his knight-errant\"*—directly continues this idea.\n\nThe whole state submitted to him. Favored by the Lord of Jin, he held no office yet ranked above the Three Ministers. Whatever he glanced at sidelong, the state of Jin ennobled; whatever he spoke of with partiality,\n**[Annotation]** *Fei* (肥) is pronounced *bi* (鄙).\nthe state of Jin demoted.\n**[Annotation]** *Fei* means \"to slight.\"\n\nLu Wenchang said: The annotation—*\"pronounced bi; fei means bo\"* (薄)—likely originally read *\"pronounced bi bo\"* (鄙薄), with *\"fei\"* being a superfluous character.\n\nDuan Yucai said: In antiquity, *fei* (肥) and *fei* (非) were interchangeable. *\"Kou suo pian fei\"* (口所偏肥) thus means *\"kou suo pian fei\"* (口所偏非, \"what the mouth slights\").\n\nHong Yi said: The *Hanshu* \"Xu Zhuan\" reads *\"an taotao er bu fei xi\"* (安滔滔而不萉兮), where Deng Zhan notes: *\"Fei* means 'to avoid.'\" *Fei* also corresponds to *fei* (腓). The *Shijing* \"Cai Wei\" states: *\"xiaoren suo fei\"* (小人所腓), with the *Mao Zhuan* glossing *\"fei\"* as \"to avoid.\" *\"Kou suo pian fei\"* (口所偏避) thus refers to those one disdains.\n\n*Shiwen* notes: *Fei* is pronounced *pi mei* (皮美切).\n\nAccording to the *Shuo Wen* and *Zi Lin*, the character is also written as *□* or *pi* (圮), both meaning \"to ruin.\" The character is an abbreviated form of *qi* (其).\n\nQin Enfu said: The *Shuo Wen* lacks the character *□*; it should be written as *脆* in common usage. *圮* should be written as *肥*. Thus, the *Shiwen* states that the character is an abbreviated form of *其*. The ancient form of *肥* (\"fleshy\") was written as *□*, from *□*, not from *色*.\n\nYu Yue said: The *Shuo Wen* lacks the character *□*. Under the *□* section: *□* means *毁* (\"to ruin\"). *□* and *毁* have similar meanings, so *□* is an error for *□*. Zhang’s annotation reads: *\"yin bi, fei, bo ye\"* (\"pronounced *bi*, *fei* means 'slight'\"), but it likely originally read: *\"fei yin bi, bo ye\"* (\"*fei*, pronounced *bi*, means 'slight'\"). This suggests it is read like *鄙薄* (\"slight\"). The character *□* is pronounced *符鄙切* (*fu bi qie*) in Sun Mian’s work, which matches Zhang’s reading. *□* is abbreviated as *肥*, hence the *Shiwen* states that the character is an abbreviated form of *其*. Qin Enfu, in his collated edition of Lu Chongxuan’s text, took *□* to be an error for *字*. How could it be glossed as *毁* (\"to ruin\")? The meaning would be difficult to reconcile. He likely misread Zhang’s annotation as *\"fei bo ye\"* (\"*fei* means 'slight'\") and thus proposed this explanation. If we correct the character to *□*, take its meaning as *毁* (\"to ruin\"), and its pronunciation as *鄙*, then all aspects align. Qin’s argument is incorrect.\n\n*\"You qi ting zhe mou yu chao\"* (\"Those who frequented his court were comparable to the court of Jin\"). The *Shiwen* notes: *\"mou yin mou, qi ye\"* (\"*mou* is pronounced *mou* and means 'equal'\"); *\"chao yin chao\"* (\"*chao* is pronounced *chao*\").\n\n*\"Zihua shi qi xia ke yi zhi bi xiang gong, qiang ruo xiang ling\"* (\"Zihua sent his retainers to attack one another with cunning and vulgarity, to overpower the weak with strength\"). The *Shiwen* notes: *\"xiang ling yi zuo xiang ji\"* (\"*xiang ling* ('to bully') has an alternate reading of *xiang ji* ('to strike')\").\n\n*\"Sui shang po yu qian, bu yong jie yi\"* (\"Though they were wounded or broken before him, he paid no heed\"). The *Shiwen* notes: *\"jie yin jie, fu ye, cheng ye\"* (\"*jie* is pronounced *jie* and means 'secondary' or 'to match'\").\n\nAll day and night, they made this their amusement, and the state nearly became a custom.\n\n**[Explanation]**\n*\"Pian shi\"* (\"partial regard\") refers to deep glances; *\"pian fei\"* (\"partial *fei*\") refers to thick slander. Scholars took their conversations as the basis of honor and disgrace, so those who frequented his gate were comparable to the court of Jin. Zihua allowed his retainers to indulge in their verbal disputes without restraint, and people mutually slandered and humiliated one another until it nearly became a custom.\n\nHesheng and Zibo, eminent retainers of the Fan clan, went on a journey and passed beyond the fields. **[Annotation]** *Shǎng* refers to the outer countryside. The *Shiwen* notes: \"*Shǎng*, pronounced *gǔ yíng*.\" They lodged at the dwelling of the field elder Shangqiu Kai. **[Annotation]** *Gēng* should be written as *sǒu*. The *Shiwen* reads \"*gēng* as *sǒu*,\" noting: \"*sǒu*, pronounced *xī kǒu*.\" Qin Enfu said: \"The *Three Elders and Five Gēng* are general terms for the elderly; writing it as *gēng* is also semantically valid.\" Ren Dachun said: \"In the *Wenwang Shizi*, the note to *Three Elders and Five Gēng* states, '*Gēng* should be *sǒu*.' The *Shiwen* of the *Wenwang Shizi* reads: '*Gēng*, *gōng héng* rhyme, the note being the same. Cai writes it as *sǒu*, pronounced *sù kǒu*.' Thus, *field gēng* as *field sǒu* aligns with *Five Gēng* as *Five Sǒu*.\" Wang Chongmin said: \"Cai’s view appears in the *Duduan*, where he argues that in vulgar script, *sǎo* (sister-in-law) is written as [a character resembling *gēng*], proving *gēng* and *sǒu* are interchangeable. Setting aside Cai’s theory on *Five Gēng*, Zhang Zhan’s text already writes it as *gēng*, so the *Shiwen*’s *sǒu* must be a later alteration. The *Taiping Yulan* (340) also cites it as *sǒu*.\"\n\nIn the dead of night, Hesheng and Zibo conversed about Zihua’s fame and influence, how he could make the living perish and the dead live, the rich poor and the poor rich. **[Explanation]** \"The living perish\" means to slander them; \"the dead live\" means to praise them. \"The rich poor\" means to seize from them; \"the poor rich\" means to bestow upon them. Shangqiu Kai, a man of humble origins, failed to comprehend this, believing it to be the work of some sagely power. Shangqiu Kai had long suffered from hunger and cold—the *Shiwen* notes: \"*xiān*, pronounced *xī jiàn*; *jiǒng*, pronounced *qí yǔn*, meaning 'distressed'\"—and secretly listened from behind the north window.\n\nYu Yue remarked: \"The north of the window is the very center of the chamber. Hesheng and Zibo lodged in the field watchman’s hut where Shangqiu Kai resided—surely they were within the room itself. How could Shangqiu Kai have listened from behind the north window? *Yǒu běi* likely ought to read *běi yǒu*, meaning 'facing north.' The *Mao Commentary* to the *Ode* 'Seventh Month' states: '*Xiàng* means a north-facing window'—this is correct. The two were inside the room, while Shangqiu Kai listened from outside the north window, which accords perfectly with reason. In antiquity, the chambers of both scholars and commoners all had north-facing windows, as explained in detail in *Qunjing Pingyi*.\n\nThereupon, he presented himself at Zihua’s gate, offering his labor in exchange for provisions, bearing a basket. The *Shiwen* notes: *Hè* is pronounced *hú kě*; *běn* is read as *běn*, meaning a wicker basket. Zihua’s disciples were all of noble lineage, clad in white silk, riding in carriages, pacing slowly with distant gazes. Upon seeing Shangqiu Kai—aged, frail, dark of face, his robes and cap in disarray—they could not but stare in astonishment. **[Annotation]** *Nè* is pronounced *nú gé*. Bo Jun notes: Wu Kaiseng suggests that *nè* likely means \"to gawk in surprise,\" deriving its sense from the combination of \"eye\" and \"ear.\" The *Zhonghua Da Zidian* defines it as \"to slight,\" interpreting it according to context. The *Shiwen* reads: *nè*, *nú gé*. The *Fangyan* states: \"In the regions of Yang and Yue, when people belittle one another as ignorant, they call it *nè*. *Nè* means disbelief in what one sees and hears.\"\n\nSoon after, they grew familiar and began to mock and deceive him. Wang Chongmin notes: The *Taiping Yulan* (430) writes *dài* as *gài*. The *Shuowen* states: \"*Dài* means to deceive with words\"; \"*gài* means silk labor.\" *Dài* is the original character, though later generations often substituted *gài*. The *Zhongni* chapter reads: \"I laugh at Long’s deception of Kong Chuan\"—these are among the few surviving instances of the ancient character. The *Shiwen* reads: *dài* is pronounced *dài*. The *Fangyan* states: \"To deceive one another. Originally written as *gài*.\"\n\nThey shoved, jostled, struck, **[Annotation]** *Dǎng* is pronounced *huǎng*; *āi* is pronounced *wū dài*; *dǎn* is read *dū gǎn*. The *Shiwen* reads: *dǎng*, *hú guǎng*; the *Fangyan* notes that people in Jiangdong today also call pushing *dǎng*. Alternately pronounced *huǎng*, meaning to beat. *Āi*, *wū hái*, meaning to push. *Dǎn*, *dīng gǎn*. The *Fangyan* states: \"To strike the back.\" Another version writes *kàng*, meaning to resist. and did all manner of things. The *Shiwen* reads: *wáng* is pronounced *wú*. Shangqiu Kai never showed a trace of resentment. The *Shiwen* reads: *yùn*, *yú wèn*. Meanwhile, the guests’ tricks were meager, The *Shiwen* reads: *jì*, *qú qí*; *dān* is pronounced *dān*, meaning exhausted. and they wearied of their games. **[Explanation]** To toy with and trifle with someone to the utmost; to grow familiar and slight them is to draw too near; to deceive and delude is to act recklessly; to shove is to provoke; to strike is to twist and turn; to jostle is to humiliate; to resist is to oppose. The *Shiwen* reads: *bèi*, *pú jiè*, meaning fatigued.\n\nThen they ascended a high terrace together. The *Shiwen* writes *jù chéng* as *jù shēng*, noting: *jù shēng* has an alternate version, *jù chéng*. *Chéng* means to ascend. Ren Dachun states: The *Hanshu*, in the *Biography of Zhang Tang*, reads: \"He then sent Shan to mount the barrier,\" with Yan Shigu glossing: \"*Chéng* means to ascend.\" The *Biography of Chen Tang* reads: \"Mounting the city walls, he called out,\" with Yan Shigu again glossing: \"*Chéng* means to ascend.\" The *Biography of Gong Yu* reads: \"Mounting the northern frontier watchtowers and lookouts,\" with Yan Shigu glossing: \"*Chéng* means to ascend.\" This aligns with the gloss of *chéng* as \"to ascend\" in *Jingshu*. Furthermore, the *Shiming* states: \"*Chéng* means to rise.\" The *Xunzi*, in the *Dalüe* chapter, reads: \"Hastily mounting the roof,\" with Yang Liang glossing *chéng* as \"to ascend.\" Thus, \"ascending the high terrace\" may also be written as *chéng*.\n\nAmid the crowd, one idly declared, The *Shiwen* reads: *màn*, *mò hàn*, meaning scattered. \"Whoever can cast themselves down shall be rewarded with a hundred gold pieces.\" The *Shiwen* writes *shǎng* as *cháng*, reading: *cháng* is pronounced *shǎng*. All clamored to accept the challenge. **[Explanation]** To mock him as a fool, the crowd feigned eagerness to obey. Shangqiu Kai took it as truth and leapt first, his form like a flying bird, soaring to the ground. The *Shiwen* notes: *fēi niǎo* has an alternate version, *fēi fú*. *Yáng*, *yú liàng*, meaning to flutter like wind-borne objects. His bones were unbroken. The *Shiwen* reads: \"□\" as *jí wěi*. The *Guangya* states: \"This is the ancient form of *wěi*.\" The *Shuowen* states: \"Bones, whether curved or straight,\" though this sense seems somewhat forced. □ is pronounced *huǐ*. Ren Dachun states: ...\n\nScholars note: \"委曲\" means winding or bending. The *Records of the Grand Historian*, in the \"Biography of Sima Xiangru,\" writes *cuī cuò* (崔错) as *bó* (癹), an ancient form of *wěi* (委). The *Wen Xuan*, in the \"Rhapsody on Dance,\" states: \"Amid the decadence of the latter age, they return,\" where Yan Shigu glosses it as *wěi* (委). The *Book of Han*, in the \"Biography of Yang Xiong,\" reads: \"The followers were indistinct and could not...,\" with differing pronunciations and meanings, lacking a *□* sound. The *Yupian* states: *□*, pronounced *qúliú*, refers to well-cooked meat sauce. As for *qū* (曲), Li Shan’s commentary equates it with *wěiqū* (委曲). The pronunciations and meanings differ. The character *fú* (□) is pronounced *fúlóng*. All these relate to *wěi* (委). The *Yupian* also includes the character *□*, pronounced *huán*, citing the *Shuowen* as \"scratching a fresh wound.\" There is also a character *jī* (肌) written as *□*, where the *□* of *yīn* (音) is also written as *jī* (肌). Thus, the *□* in the *Shiwen*’s pronunciation may be an error for another character. Even modern editions remain uncertain about the transmission error in the *Shiwen*. Fan’s faction deemed it coincidental and saw no cause for suspicion. The *Shiwen* writes *jù* (讵) as *jù* (巨), noting: *ǒu* (偶) is pronounced *wǔkǒu*. *Jù* (巨) means \"great,\" with an alternate version as *jù* (讵). Ren Dachun states: In the *Book of Han*, \"Annals of Emperor Gao,\" it reads: \"If the Duke of Pei had not first broken through Guanzhong, could you have entered?\" where Yan Shigu glosses *jù* (巨) as *jù* (讵). The *Shiwen* on the *Zhuangzi*’s \"On the Equality of Things\" notes: \"Yōngjù (庸讵), where Xu’s edition writes *jù* (讵) as *jù* (巨),\" showing that *jù* (讵) and *jù* (巨) are interchangeable. This corroborates Jing Shun’s *Shiwen*, where *jù* (讵) is written as *jù* (巨).\n\nHe then pointed to the deep bends of the river’s curve and said: The *Shiwen* notes: *fù* (复) is pronounced *fúyòu*. *Yín* (淫) sounds *shēn*. *Wēi* (隈), pronounced *wūhuī*, means \"water’s bend,\" with an alternate version as *yú* (隅). \"Within lies a precious pearl; if you dive, you may retrieve it.\" The *Shiwen* notes: *yǒng* (泳) sounds *yǒng*, meaning \"to swim submerged.\" Shangqiu Kai then dove in. **[Annotation]** Swimming submerged at the water’s bottom is called *yǒng*. The *Shiwen* notes: *dǐ* (底) is pronounced *dūlǐ*. Upon emerging, he indeed obtained the pearl. The crowd was struck with doubt. **[Annotation]** *Fǎng* (昉) means \"to begin.\" The *Shiwen* notes: *fǎng* (昉) is pronounced *fēnliǎng*, or written as *fàng* (放). Yu Yue states: The ancient character *fàng* (放) is interchangeable with *fāng* (方). The *Book of Documents*, in the \"Canon of Yao,\" reads: \"Rejecting commands and disrupting clans,\" while the *Book of Han*, in the \"Biographies of Fu Xi\" and \"Wang Shang,\" both write it as \"放命圮族,\" serving as evidence. The *Guangya*, in its \"Explanation of Terms,\" states: *Fāng* (方) means \"to begin.\" Thus, *fǎng* (昉) is a vulgar character, *fàng* (放) is the standard character, and both derive from *fāng* (方), meaning \"beginning.\"\n\nZihua then began to provide him with meat, grain, clothing, and silk. Soon after, a great fire broke out in Fan’s treasury. Wang Chongmin notes: The *Taiping Yulan*, fascicle 430, cites *dà huǒ* (大火) as *shī huǒ* (失火). Zihua said: \"Whoever can enter the fire and retrieve the brocade shall be rewarded according to the amount they recover.\" Shangqiu Kai went without hesitation. The *Shiwen* notes: *nán* (难) is pronounced *nǎihàn*. He entered and exited the fire, his body untouched by soot. The *Shiwen* notes: This marks the end of a sentence. *Āi* (埃) has an alternate version as *□*. His person remained unscorched.\n\nThe faction of Fan’s clan, believing him to possess the Dao, collectively apologized to him, saying: “We did not know you possessed the Dao and thus deceived you. The *Taiping Yulan*, fascicle 430, cites this as: *‘We did not know you possessed the Dao and thus misled you; we did not know you were a divine being and thus humiliated you.’* You must think us fools, deaf, or blind. We dare ask: what is your Dao?”\n\nThe commentary explains: Descending from the terrace as if in flight, retrieving pearls from water as if on land, and entering and exiting fire unharmed—all of Zihua’s disciples regarded him as divine and in possession of the Dao. Yet here he endures deception and anger without resentment, as if we were deaf and blind. We dare ask: what is your Dao?\n\nShangqiu Kai replied: “I possess no Dao. The *Shiwen* notes: *wáng* is pronounced *wú*. Even in my own heart, I do not know the reason. The *Taiping Yulan*, fascicle 430, adds a *qí* (其) after *bùzhī* (不知). Nevertheless, there is one thing I can tell you. When those two guests lodged at my dwelling, I heard them praise the power of the Fan clan—they claimed it could make the living perish and the dead live, the rich poor and the poor rich. I believed them wholeheartedly, without doubt. Yu Yue notes: The *Er Ya*’s *Shi Gu* states: *‘Chéng* (诚) means *xìn* (信).’ Thus, *wú chéng zhī* (吾诚之) is *wú xìn zhī* (吾信之). I believed them so completely that I came without hesitation. Upon arrival, I took your faction’s words as truth, fearing only that my belief was not sincere enough. Lu Wenchang notes: The *Taiping Yulan* omits the repeated *zhī* (之) below. Bo Jun observes: This passage appears in *Taiping Yulan*, fascicle 430. I feared my actions fell short, not knowing where to place my body or where harm and benefit lay. My heart was unified, nothing more. When nothing in the external world conflicts with the mind, it is like this. Wang Chongmin notes: The Jifu edition omits the first *yǐ* (已). The *Taiping Yulan*, fascicle 430, cites *éryǐ* (而已) as *yǐyǐ* (已矣). Now that I know your faction deceived me, inwardly I harbor suspicion and doubt, while outwardly I feign composure and vigilance. I cling to the fortune of not having been scorched or drowned in the past, yet my heart burns with distress and trembles with fear. The *Shiwen* notes: *Dá* (怛) is pronounced *dīngdá* and means ‘startled.’ How could I dare approach water or fire again?”\n\nThe commentary explains: Laozi’s saying, *“Great wisdom appears foolish,”* resembles this but is not the same. One whose will is single-minded and free of other concerns, who can suddenly forget their bodily form, will find that life and death, joy and fear cannot penetrate. How much more so for one who merges with the Dao, treasures their spirit to unite with the real, whose wisdom encompasses the cosmos, and whose merit suffices for all things—how could such matters be discussed in mere fragments? But once right and wrong arise in the heart, even water and fire become unapproachable. The *Shiwen* notes: *jìn* (近) is read in the falling tone.\n\nAfter this, when Fan’s disciples encountered beggars or horse-doctors on the road, they dared not insult them but would alight from their carriages to bow. Zai Wo heard of this and reported it to Confucius. Confucius said: “Did you not know?”\n\nThe person of utmost sincerity can move all things. They stir heaven and earth, move ghosts and spirits, traverse the six directions without resistance—how could this be limited to treading perilous paths or entering water and fire? The *Shiwen* notes: *xiǎn* (险) is read with the falling tone. If even Shang Qiu Kai’s belief in false things was not rebuffed, how much more so when both self and other are sincere? Young ones, take heed!\n\nThe beggars and horse-doctors are all lowly people, yet one does not dare slight them. The Master’s words fully express the principle of utmost sincerity’s power to move. The *Shiwen* notes: *zhì* (识) is read as *zhì*.\n\nDuring the reign of King Xuan of Zhou, there was a herdsman named Liang Yang in charge of livestock. The *Shiwen* notes: King Xuan was named Jing, son of King Li. *Mùzhèng* refers to the overseer of animals. *Yāng* (鸯) is read as *yāng*. He could raise wild birds and beasts, feeding them within the palace gardens. The *Shiwen* notes: *wěi* (委) is read as *wěi*. *Shí* (食) is read as *sì*; the same applies to *shí hǔ* (食虎) below. Even tigers, wolves, eagles, and osprey—none were not gentle and docile. The original text omits *xùn* (驯) after *róu* (柔); the *Zang* edition and *Shi De Tang* edition include it, and it is now restored. The *Yùlǎn* (926) omits *xùn*. The *Shiwen* notes: *diāo è* (雕鹗) is read as *diāo è*. *Xùn* (驯) is read as *sūn lún*, meaning \"obedient.\" One edition omits *xùn*. Males and females stood before him, breeding in groups. The *Shiwen* notes: *zī* (孳) is read as *zī* or *zì*. *Zīwěi* (孳尾) refers to the reproduction of male and female. Birth and transformation are called *zī*; mating is called *wěi*. Different species lived together without attacking or biting one another. The *Shiwen* notes: *bó shì* (搏噬) is read as *bó shì*. The king, fearing that the skill would die with him, ordered Mao Qiu Yuan to transmit it. The *Shiwen* reads \"transmit it\" as \"transmit and receive it,\" noting: Mao Qiu Yuan’s surname was Mao, and his given name was Qiu Yuan. One edition writes *yǔ* (圉), read as *yǔ lǚ*. One edition omits *shòu* (受).\n\nLiang Yang said: \"I am but a lowly servant—what art could I possibly teach you? Yet I fear the king may suspect I am withholding something from you, so let me speak briefly of my method for raising tigers.\n\nAll creatures with blood and qi are by nature pleased when obeyed and enraged when opposed. But are their joy and anger ever wantonly expressed? No—both arise only when their will is thwarted.\n\nWhen feeding a tiger, one must never offer it living prey, for it will grow furious at having to kill. As the commentary notes: *This is to avoid provoking its killing rage.* Wang Shu-min observes that the *Beishan Lu*’s *Yixue* chapter renders *‘its rage’* as *‘and grow enraged’*; the *Taiping Yulan* (891) and *Jizuan Yuanhai* (98) both read *‘fear its rage’*, with the same variation below.\n\nNor should one offer it whole prey, for it will grow furious at having to tear it apart. As the commentary notes: *This is to avoid provoking its exertion-induced rage.* The *Shiwen* records an alternate reading of *‘tear it apart’* as *‘rend it’*. Wang Shu-min notes that the *Shilei Fu* (20), *Jizuan Yuanhai* (98), and *Tianzhong Ji* (60) all read *‘rend it’*, as does the *Zhuangzi*’s *Renjian Shi* chapter.\n\nOne must time its hunger and satiety, and comprehend the source of its anger. As Xiang Xiu comments: *This means discerning the cause of its anger and aligning with it.* Wang Shu-min notes that the *Huainanzi*’s *Zhushu* chapter reads *‘anger’* as *‘wrath’*—*‘wrath’* pairs better with *‘hunger and satiety’*, so this reading should be followed. *‘Heart’* here is likely a corrupted form of *‘wrath’*.\n\nThough tigers and humans are of different kinds, they fawn upon those who raise them—this is obedience. Thus, when they kill, it is defiance. As the commentary notes: *They harm other beings because their will is opposed.* Lu Wenchang observes that in the Zang edition, the commentary includes an *‘and’* after *‘harm other beings’*, which may originally have been *‘due to’*. The note also ends with *‘also’*. Wang Chongmin notes that the *Zhuangzi*’s *Renjian Shi* chapter reads *‘kill’* as *‘killers’*—this should be followed. *Thus* here functions as *therefore* (see *Jingzhuan Shici*). This means that though tigers differ from humans, their fawning upon their keepers stems from having their nature obeyed, while their bloodlust arises from having it defied. Wang Shu-min suggests the original text may have read *‘Thus those who kill them do so through defiance.’* The current version omits *‘those’*, while the *Zhuangzi* omits *‘them’*—neither is complete. However, Guo Pu’s commentary already reflects this meaning, so his edition must have been uncorrupted.\n\nThen how could I dare oppose them and provoke their anger? Yet neither do I obey them to elicit their joy. For joy inevitably gives way to anger, and anger to joy—both miss the mark. As the commentary notes: *Deviating from the mean, extremes inevitably reverse—this is the natural order.*\n\nNow, my heart harbors neither opposition nor compliance, so birds and beasts regard me as one of their own. Thus, those that roam my garden do not long for lofty forests or vast marshes. As the *Shiwen* records, *‘vast marshes’* is also written *‘expansive marshes’*. Ren Dachun notes: The *Zuozhuan*’s twenty-eighth year of Duke Zhuang reads *‘guangmo’* (广莫), with the commentary glossing it as *‘a desolate expanse’*. The *Xunzi*’s *Jiebi* chapter reads *‘then how could it be vast enough to overcome it?’*, with Yang Liang noting *‘vast’* may be read as *‘desolate’*. The *Wangba* chapter reads *‘why not make it vast?’*, with Yang Liang again noting *‘vast’* may be read as *‘desolate’*. The *Hanshu*’s *Wu Wuzhi Zhuan* reads *‘how boundless is the art of deception!’*, with Su Lin glossing *‘boundless’* as *‘desolate’*. Thus, *vast* and *desolate* are interchangeable.\n\nThose that rest in my courtyard do not yearn for deep mountains or secluded valleys—this is the principle at work. As the commentary notes: *The sage’s way of nurturing all beings, allowing each to fulfill its nature, is like a trainer’s skill in raising animals without letting them harm one another.*\n\nThe *Exegesis* states: *Though forms and substances differ, their spirit and qi are not distinct. Thus, the Zhuangzi says: ‘Viewed in their differences, liver and gallbladder are as distant as Chu and Yue; viewed in their sameness, the myriad things are one body.’ The perfected person unites with them in spirit, so that birds do not scatter in flight and beasts do not disperse in herds—opposition and compliance share the same intent without conflict. Hence, fierce beasts can be tamed, and gulls can be befriended. Birds and beasts retreat to deep mountains and secluded valleys to preserve themselves, far from human harm. But if no threat exists, then what difference is there between gardens and forests?*\n\nYan Hui asked Confucius: *\"I once crossed the Goblet Depths, where the ferryman handled the boat as if by magic.\"* Sun Yirang notes: The *Shuowen*’s *Water* section defines *jin* (津) as *‘a river crossing’*; *jinren* likely refers to the officials or soldiers in charge of ferries. The *Zuozhuan*’s twenty-fourth year of Duke Zhao records: *\"Prince Chao used the treasured jades of Chengzhou to sacrifice to the Yellow River. On the jiayin day, a ferryman retrieved them from the river.\"* Liu Xiang’s *Lienü Zhuan*’s *Biantong* chapter mentions *\"Zhao Jinjuan, the daughter of a ferry official of Zhao.\"* The *Shiwen* reads *cao* (操) as *qī dāo*; the same below.\n\n*\"I asked him, ‘Can one learn to handle a boat?’ He replied, ‘Yes. Those who can swim can be taught. Those skilled in swimming often succeed.’\"* As Xiang Xiu comments: *Their skill comes naturally—this means their method ensures they are unafraid of boats.* The *Shiwen* records *‘unafraid of boats’* as *‘seizing boats’*, noting *shu* (数) is read *sè jù*, meaning *‘method’*; the commentary concurs.\n\n\"Zhuó (擢) is pronounced *zhí xiào*; in one version, it is written as *jù* (惧), likely a miswriting of the character. Bo Jun notes: Originally, it was *‘zhuó zhōu’* (擢舟); *zhuó* was mistakenly written as *jù* (惧), and some meddler further added the character *bù* (不). Jing Shun’s edition already shows the error of *jù* (惧), though it had not yet added *bù* (不).\n\nAs for the diver, one who has never seen a boat yet rises to handle it—\"\n\n**[Annotation]**\n*Sù* (谡) means *to rise*.\nXiang Xiu says: *This refers to one skilled in diving.*\n**[Note]**\nThe character *wù* (鹜) in the annotation appears as *jīn* (矜) in the Northern Song edition; Wang’s edition follows this, but the present text corrects it according to the *Zang* edition. Additionally, the *Sijie* edition appends the three characters *‘wù yīn mù’* (鹜音木) at the end of the annotation.\nZeng Guangyuan says: In Chu dialect, foolishness is called *sōng tóu sōng nǎo* (倯头倯脑), akin to the Northern term *tóu nǎo* (头脑). In Chu, *sōng* (倯) is also called *sù* (谡). *Liezi* states that one who has never seen a boat yet *sù* (谡) operates it—*sù* here means *to act thus*.\n**[Shiwen]**\n*Sù* (谡) is pronounced *suǒ liù*; *Zhuangzi* writes it as *biàn* (便). *Wù* (鹜) is pronounced *mù*, meaning *duck*. In one version, it is written as *jīn* (矜), an erroneous character.\n\n\"I asked again, but received no answer. May I dare ask what this means?\"\n\n[Solution]\nOne who skillfully steers a boat can learn it; one who skillfully swims and floats has practiced it in sequence. As for the diver who has never seen a boat yet masters it, this is a matter of spiritual communion—others cannot comprehend it.\n\nConfucius said: “Ah! *Yi*!” [Shiwen] *Yi* (□) is pronounced *yī*, identical to *yī* (□), an exclamatory sound. Hu Huaichen says: *Yi* (□) is the same as *yī* (噫). “You and I have long studied its text,” [Shiwen] *Wan* (玩) is pronounced *wǔ guàn*, meaning “to practice.” “yet have not grasped its reality, and thus merely discourse on the Dao.”\n\n[Annotation]\nObserving that boat-handling can be learned is merely studying its text; failing to realize that divers inherently possess the ability is not yet attaining its reality. Now I shall explain it to you. Tao Hongqing says: Zhang’s annotation, “boat-handling can be learned,” is entirely mistaken. Confucius’s meaning is that you and I have only practiced the text of principles without ever verifying them in reality, and thus fundamentally cannot comprehend the Dao. The following passage—“Master Huzi said, ‘You and I have not yet exhausted its text and reality, yet fundamentally grasp the Dao’”—with Xiang Xiu’s annotation, “Reality is revealed through text, and the Dao is manifested through affairs,” precisely captures its intent. It is suspected that *qie* (且) here should also be *de* (得); the lower half of the ancient character was damaged, leading to its misreading as *qie*. [Shiwen] *Yu* (与) is pronounced *yú*. *Wei* (为) is pronounced *yú wěi*.\n\nOne who can swim may be taught—this is due to their lightness in water. One who excels at swimming does so through technique, for they have forgotten the water. [Annotation] To forget the water is to be free of pride or fear. Lu Wenchang says: The *Zang* edition of the annotation reads, “One who forgets the water is then free of pride or fear.” Tao Hongqing says: After “one who can swim,” there should also be a *zhi* (之).\n\nAs for the diver who has never seen a boat yet acts thus in steering it, to him the abyss appears as a mound, and a capsized boat seems no different from a cart rolling backward. The overturning and retreat of the myriad things lie arrayed before him, yet none can enter his dwelling. [Annotation] This is called the dwelling of spirit. Lu Wenchang says: The *Zang* edition of the annotation reads, “This is the dwelling of spirit, thus it is called *she* (舍).” Yu Yue says: *Fang* (方) means “together.” The original meaning of *fang* is two boats side by side, hence it carries the sense of “together.” In the *Xunzi*’s “Zhi Shi” chapter, “None fail to clearly understand and rise together in pursuit of utmost perfection,” Yang’s annotation says: “Fangqi (方起) means to rise together.” In the *Han Shu*’s “Yang Xiong Zhuan,” “Though together they journey with Qiao and Woquan,” Yan Shigu’s annotation says: “Fang means to travel side by side.” Both serve as evidence. *Fang chen hu qian* (方陈乎前) means the myriad things lie arrayed together before him. Xi Diao says: Yu’s interpretation is incorrect. In the *Yi Jing*’s *Heng* hexagram, “The noble person establishes without changing *fang*.” Wang Bi’s annotation says: “*Fang* means the Dao.” *Fuque* (覆却) follows the above analogy of boats and carts; *fuque wan fang* (覆却万方) refers to the many ways in which boats and carts overturn and retreat. The *Liezi*’s “Huangdi” chapter adds the character *wu* (物), but the *Zhuangzi* does not.\n\nWhere could he not find leisure? [Annotation] All he encounters is leisure. [Shiwen] *Wu* (恶) is pronounced *wū*. *Jian* (间) is pronounced *xián*.\n\nThose who play with clay tiles are skillful—*Shiwen* notes: \"*Kou* (抠) means to probe; using the hand to conceal an object and probe to retrieve it is called *kou*, also termed *cangkou* (藏彄).\" *Fengtu Ji* states: \"After the sacrificial drinking on the La day, elders and children play the game of *kou*.\" Xin’s *San Qin Ji* records: \"Lady Gouyi of Han had clenched fists, and people of the time imitated her, thus naming it *canggou* (藏钩).\" *Kou* (彄) is pronounced *kou* (口侯切), and *Zhuangzi* writes it as *kou* (抠). Qin Enfu says: \"In the current edition of *Zhuangzi*, *kou* is written as *zhu* (注).\"\n\nThose who play with hooks are cautious—*Shiwen* notes: \"Hooks are made of silver or bronze.\" *Dan* (惮) is pronounced *dàn* (待汗切).\n\nThose who play with gold are confused. [Annotation] The act of mutual concealment is called *kou*. Guo Xiang says: \"The heavier the stake, the more the mind clings.\" The annotation’s \"曰\" in the *Shide Tang* edition is written as \"者,\" which is incorrect; the present version follows the *Zang* edition. Shen Chiran says: \"*Zhuangzi*’s *Das Sheng* chapter borrows this passage but changes *kou* to *zhu* (注).\" Note: *Tou* (投) means *kou*; shooting to wager is called *zhu* (注). Bo Jun notes: \"My teacher, Master Wu Jianzai, says: *Zhuangzi* writes *zhu* (注), *Lüshi Chunqiu* writes *zhu* (殶), and *Huainanzi* writes *zhu* (鉒), all phonetically similar, likely referring to the name of a winning tally in gambling.\" *Huainanzi*’s annotation states: \"*Zhu* (鉒) means *tima* (提马), the 'horse' set up for the victor in *touhu* (投壶).\" Today, local customs call the gambling tally *zhuma* (注马), a vestige of this term. *Liezi* writes *kou* (抠), treating it as the character for *cangkou* (藏彄), with a distinct meaning. *Shiwen* writes *hun* (惛) as *hun* (殙), noting: \"*Hun* is pronounced *hūn*.\" *Fangyan* says: \"Confusion is *hun*.\" *Yao* (要) is pronounced *yáo* (于遥切). *Yu* (愈) is pronounced *yǔ* (庾), meaning \"to increase.\"\n\nSkill is one—Xu Weiyu says: \"The character *qi* (其) is likely missing before *qiao* (巧).\" *Zhuangzi*’s *Das Sheng* chapter writes, \"Their skill is one,\" and *Lüshi Chunqiu*’s *Qu You* chapter writes, \"Their auspice is one,\" both including the character *qi* (其) as evidence.\n\nYet when one clings, it is an attachment to externals. All who cling to externals are clumsy within. [Annotation] Only by forgetting both internal and external, relinquishing light and heavy, can one transcend skill and clumsiness.\n\n[Exegesis] Observing the boatman reveals what may be learned, for one savors the text. But if one grasps its truth, then he regards water as land, and capsizing or drowning does not enter his mind—where could he not find leisure? Those who wager with tiles see only their skill in hitting the mark and do not fear losing the tile; if they wager with hooks, they are no longer solely focused on skill but also dread the clumsiness of losing the hook; if they wager with gold, they dare not hope to hit the mark, only fearing the loss of gold. Thus, one sees that the former marvel forgot external things, while the latter fears and clings to them. People of this age know the dual loss of clinging to externals yet covet things to the point of forfeiting their lives.\n\n\"Clumsy\" (*zhuo*, 拙) in the Northern Song edition is written as *quan* (撰), which Wang’s edition follows; other editions write *gong* (拱). Lu Wenchang says: \"*Gong* (拱) in the *Zang* edition is *zhuo* (拙), which is correct.\" The present version follows it. *Zhuangzi* also writes *zhuo* (拙). *Gong* (拱) and *zhuo* (拙) are graphically similar, hence the error. *Shiwen* writes *zhuo* (拙) as *gong* (拱), noting: \"*Gong* is originally *zhuo*.\"\n\nConfucius observed at Lüliang—Zhuang Kuiji says: There are two accounts of Lüliang. One places it in the West River. Sima Biao says: \"Lüliang is west of Lishi County.\" *Shui Jing Zhu* states: \"The river converges with a stream emerging eighty *li* southwest of the old city of Shanwu County. The water flows west, passing through the Lüliang Mountains, forming the Lüliang Rapids. Before Lüliang was opened, the river emerged above Mengmen. This was likely the passage Yu the Great opened to channel the river. Today, following the river west from Lishi County, there are no passes until reaching this point, where it becomes a great peril—this is Lüliang. It lies over a hundred *li* northeast of Lishi.\" (Bo Jun’s note: The original text of *Shui Jing Zhu* ends here; as this is an abridged citation, no quotation marks are added. The phrase \"over a hundred *li* northeast\" originally reads \"over two hundred *li* northeast,\" likely a minor error.)\n\nAnother account places it in Pengcheng. Yu Zhengxie says: The *Shuo Fu* chapter states, \"Confucius returned from Wei to Lu, rested his carriage at the river bridge, and observed it,\" which is the same event. *Zhuangzi*’s *Das Sheng* chapter refers to the river bridge as the place Confucius observed. *Shiwen* cites Sima Biao: \"Where the river is cut by rocks, now in the west of Lishi in the West River, there is such a precipitous place, commonly called Huangliang.\" *Lüshi Chunqiu*’s *Ai Lei* chapter says, \"Lüliang was not yet opened,\" and Gao You’s annotation states: \"In Lü County of Pengcheng, a great stone lies in the water, which Yu opened to clear the way.\" *Huainanzi*’s *Ben Jing* chapter says, \"Lüliang was not yet opened,\" and its annotation also states: \"In Pengcheng.\" Note: The four texts describe two different Lüliangs. The *Zhuangzi* and *Liezi* passages refer to Pengcheng, while *Lüshi Chunqiu* and *Huainanzi* place Lüliang in Lishi. The ancient annotations are thus confused.\n\n*Shui Jing Zhu* cites Confucius’s observation in its account of the Si River and Lü’s text and Sima’s account in its account of the Yellow River, which is truly comprehensive. *Zhuangzi*’s *Shiwen* states: \"Northerners call all waters *he* (河).\" Thus, the Si River may also be called *he*. *Han Shu*’s *Gou Xu Zhi* states: \"Yu split two channels; later, during the Three Dynasties, a canal was dug from the river southeast of Xingyang to form the Honggou, connecting Song, Wei, Chen, Cai, Cao, and Zheng, and meeting the Ji, Ru, Huai, and Si in Chu.\" The Si River’s bridge is thus rightly called a river bridge. Liu Fengshi of Song, in his collation of *Han Shu*, mistakenly deemed this an error. Some claim the Si River’s Lüliang originated in the Tang. *Dushi Fangyu Jiyao* states it existed in the Jin and Song dynasties, but such claims are imprecise.\n\n*Zhuangzi*’s *Shiwen* states: \"Lüliang is in present-day Pengcheng Prefecture.\" *Erya* says: \"Where rocks obstruct the water is called a *liang* (weir).\" The suspended water falls thirty *ren*, though *Wen Xuan*’s note to Xie Lingyun’s *Returning to My Old Garden and Seeing Ministers Yan and Fan* quotes this as \"forty *ren*.\" *Shuo Yuan*’s *Za Yan* chapter concurs. The torrent’s foam extends thirty *li*, where soft-shelled turtles, alligators, fish, and turtles cannot swim. Yet I saw a man swimming there. Taking him for one in distress seeking death, I had my disciples follow the current to rescue him. *Shiwen* notes: *bing* (并) is pronounced *pang* (傍). *Records of the Grand Historian* and *Han Shu* write *panghai* (傍海) and *panghe* (傍河) as *binghai* (并海) and *binghe* (并河). *Cheng* (承) is pronounced *zheng* (拯); *Fangyan* defines *cheng* as \"to pull one from drowning.\" Some texts simply write *zheng* (拯), while others use *zheng* (撜).\n\nAfter several hundred paces, he emerged, hair unbound, singing as he swam through the *tang* (pond). [Note: *Tang* (棠) should be *tang* (塘), and *xing* (行) should be *xia* (下). The *Sijie* edition writes *tangxia* (塘下), likely following the note’s correction.] *Shiwen* states: *tang* (棠) is pronounced *tang* (塘), and the same applies below.\n\nConfucius approached and asked him, \"At Lüliang, the water falls thirty *ren*, its foam stretches thirty *li*, where even soft-shelled turtles and alligators cannot swim—yet I saw you tread there. [Note: *Dao* (道) should be *dao* (蹈). The *Sijie* edition writes *dao* (蹈), following Zhang’s note. *Shiwen* reads *dao* (道) as *dao* (导), and the same applies below. Guo Pu’s note to *Mu Tianzi Zhuan* says *dao* (道) means \"to follow.\" Mr. Bo Jun observes: *Dao* (道) should be corrected to *dao* (蹈), as the later phrase *qing wen dao shui you dao hu* (请问蹈水有道乎) uses *dao* (蹈), confirming this. Though *Shiwen*’s reading as *dao* (导) is plausible, Zhang’s note is closer to the mark.] I thought you were in distress, seeking death, so I had my disciples follow the current to rescue you. You emerged, hair unbound, singing—at first, I took you for a ghost. But seeing you are a man, may I ask if there is a Way to treading water?\"\n\nThe man replied, \"No. [Note: *Shiwen* reads *wang* (亡) as *wu* (无); the original text lacks this *wang* (亡).] I have no Way. I begin with what is familiar, grow with my nature, and complete it through fate. I enter with the *qi* and emerge with the *gu*.\" [Note: *Qi* (赍) and *gu* (汨) describe the water’s swirling entry and surging exit. *Shiwen* writes *qi* (赍) as *qi* (齐), citing Sima: \"*Qi* (齐) is the swirling water like a mill’s wheel.\" *Gu* (汨) is pronounced *gu* (古忽切), meaning \"surging waves.\" Guo Xiang says: \"The swirling descent and surging rise are *gu* (汨).\" Ren Dachun notes: The note says *qi* (赍) and *gu* (汨) describe the swirling entry and surging exit, matching Sima’s \"swirling water like a mill’s wheel.\" *Shuowen* writes *qi* (□) as *□□*. *Yupian* writes *qi* (脐) as *□*. The current text’s *qi* (赍) is likely a corruption of *□*. Also, *hui shui hui fu* (洄水洄伏) in *Zhuangzi*’s *Da Sheng* chapter is written as *hui shui hui fu* (回水回伏) in *Shiwen*. *Hui* (回) means \"to turn,\" while *hui* (洄) means \"to flow against the current.\" *Shuowen*, *Yupian*, *Guangyun*, and *Leipian* all distinguish these two meanings. *Xunzi*’s *Zhi Shi* chapter says, \"When water is deep, it *hui* (回)\"; Yang Liang’s note: \"*Hui* (回) means swirling flow. Deep water without rapids often swirls.\" *Huainanzi*’s *Ben Jing* chapter says, \"*Xuan liu hui bo* (旋流回波)\" and later, \"*qu fu zhan hui yi xiang yu yu* (曲拂邅回以象湡语).\" All swirling waters use *hui* (回), while *hui* (洄) refers to flowing against the current. *Wen Xuan*’s *Wu Du Fu* says, \"*Su hui shun liu* (泝洄顺流)\"; *Jiang Fu* says, \"*Su hui yan liu* (泝洄沿流)\"; Li Shan’s note cites the *Mao Zhuan*: \"Flowing against the current is *hui* (洄).\" *Shui Jing Zhu* says, \"Yang Yi lived at *Shanghui* (上洄), Yang Yong at *Xiahui* (下洄)\"; the water’s name *hui* (洄) distinguishes upstream and downstream, implying flowing against the current. *Hou Han Shu*’s *Ren Yan Zhuan* says, \"Every ten *li*, a water gate was built to make the flow *hui* (洄).\" Li Xian’s note cites *Erya*: \"Flowing against the current is *hui* (洄).\" Thus, *hui* (洄) and *hui* (回) have distinct meanings. However, *Erya*’s *Shi Shui* and *Shiwen* read *hui* (回) as *hui* (户恢反), also written as *hui* (洄). *Wen Xuan*’s *Qi Fa* says, \"*Zhi shi ren hui an qi chuang yan* (直使人洄暗凄怆焉)\"; Li Shan’s note: \"*Hui* (洄) is the same as *hui* (回).\" Thus, *hui* (回) and *hui* (洄) are also interchangeable. Hence, *Zhuangzi*’s *Shiwen* writes *hui* (回), while *Liezi*’s *Shiwen* writes *hui* (洄).] I follow the water’s Way without imposing my will—this is how I tread it.\"\n\nConfucius asked, \"What do you mean by beginning with what is familiar, growing with your nature, and completing it through fate?\"\n\nThe man replied, \"I was born on the hills and am at ease on the hills—this is what is familiar. [Note: *Gu* (故) means \"what is inherent.\" Following one’s true nature means being at ease with whatever one encounters.] I grew up in the water and am at ease in the water—this is my nature. [Note: Following the principles of one’s nature means nothing opposes it.] Not knowing why I am so, yet being so—this is fate.\" [Note: The principle of spontaneity cannot be known through wisdom; recognizing its unknowability is called fate.]\n\n[Exegesis] Being born on the hills and at ease on the hills, born in the water and at ease in the water—habit makes this natural. Thus, it is said: \"beginning with what is familiar\" and \"growing with one’s nature.\" Accustomed to what is familiar and at ease with one’s nature, one suddenly attains spiritual accord, completing one’s fate without self-awareness. Hence, the *Yi* says, \"Exhausting principle and fully realizing one’s nature leads to fate.\" Fate is harmony with the spiritual Way.\n\nWhen Confucius traveled to Chu, he came upon a hunchback catching cicadas in the forest. [Note: The *Shide Tang* edition writes *lou* (偻) as *lou* (慺), or sometimes as *yu* (). Ren Dachun notes: *Shuowen* says, \"*Lou* (偻) can mean *beilou* (背偻, hunchbacked).\" *Tongsu Wen* says, \"A bent spine is called *yulou* (伛偻).\" *Huainanzi*’s *Jingshen Xun* says, \"Zi Qiu was fifty-four and suffered from *yulou* (伛偻).\"]\n\nYang Liang’s annotation reads, “*Lou* (偻) means a bent spine.” The *Dixing Xun* states, “Those people have faces and *lou* (末偻),” with Yang Liang’s annotation: “*Mo* (末) means the spine.” All glosses for a curved spine use *lou* (偻). The *Yupian* states: “*Lou* (慺) means reverent and respectful, not frivolous, or humble in demeanor—it carries no sense of a bent spine.”\n\nIt is said: *Ju* (痀) is pronounced *yu* (于禹切) in modern editions, but *lou* (偻) is mistakenly written as *lou* (慺). Bo Jun notes: Ren Dachun erroneously attributed Gao You’s annotation to Yang Liang.\n\nThe *Shiwen* reads “*cheng tiao* (承蜩)” as *cheng* (承), pronounced *zhiyao* (直遥切), and also *sheyin tiao* (涉音条), with an alternate version writing *tiao* (蜩), meaning “cicada.” Ren Dachun states: The *Guangyun* reads *lou* (偻) as *lü* (缕). *Julou* (痀偻) means a hunched-back ailment. Alternate forms include *chao* (晁) and *zhao* (朝).\n\nThe *Chuci*’s *Tianwen* asks, “Why did [X] delight in *buzhou* (不周)?” with *yao* (遥) pronounced *qie* (切), and *tiao* (条) as *tuliao* (徒聊切). *Chao* (晁) shares the pronunciation of *zhao* (朝, morning). The *Tianwen* also states, “They met at *chao* (晁),” with the *Maoshi* reading, “They met at dawn (*zhao*, 朝) when the skies were clear.” The *Shiji*’s later sections and the *Hanshu*’s *Zi Cuo Zhuan* read *chao* (晁) as *zhao* (朝), with *zhuyao* (竹遥) as the fanqie. Liu Bozhuang reads it as *chao* (潮).\n\nThe *Justice* states: In the *Qin Ji*, “*Shuzhang* (庶长) may correspond to *chao zhao* (晁朝),” with *chao* (潮) as a homophone. The *Shiwen* suggests that in antiquity, *chao* (朝) meant “light.” Based on these sources, the characters *wan* (琬) and *yan* (琰) are adopted.\n\nYan Shigu states: “*Yan* (匽) is also a cicada, though the reading need not be altered.” Consulting the *Shuowen*, it reads “*tiao* (蜩),” pronounced *tiao* (条), though the origin is unclear. *Zhuangzi* writes *cheng tiao* (承蜩), while here it is written as *cheng* (承), a name for the insect.\n\nFurther consulting the *Xia Xiaozheng*: “In the fifth month, the *tangtiao* (唐蜩) sings,” with Lu Bian’s annotation: “The *tangtiao* is *yan* (匽).” It is read like *zhao* (朝). Yang Xiong’s *Fangyan* states: “*Yan* (匽)...” Lu Ji’s *Caomu Chongyu Shu* notes: “The *tang* (螗) is a large, black cicada, also called *yan* (蝘).” The *Piya* states: “The *tang* (螗) is also called *yan* (蝘). The *Xia Xiaozheng*’s *tangtiao* (螗蜩) is the same as *yan* (匽) in the *Xia Xiaozheng*—that is, *yan* (蝘蝘).” Thus, the *Shuowen*’s *yan* (匽) is identical to *cheng* (承), derived from *min* (黾), just as *ying* (蝇) and *□* are derived from *min* (黾). This is *cheng* (承). Generally, creatures of the *min* (黾) family have pointed heads and large abdomens. Cicadas also have pointed heads and large abdomens, so *yan tiao* (匽蜩) need not alter its reading. It is akin to *duo* (掇).\n\nThe *Shiwen* states: *Duo* (掇) is pronounced *duokuo* (都括切), meaning “to gather or pluck.”\n\nConfucius said: “How skillful you are! Is there a method to this?”\n\nHe replied: \"I have my method. In the fifth or sixth month, if I stack two pellets and they do not fall, I lose only a trifling amount. [Note] Xiang Xiu said: Stacking two pellets without their falling demonstrates the steadiness of the hand. Thus, in catching cicadas, what is lost amounts to no more than a *zizhu* (a tiny weight). *Shiwen* writes *lei* (累) as *lei* (累), noting: *Lei* is the ancient form of *lei*. *Wan* is pronounced like *wan* (丸). Sima [Biao] said: It means stacking pellets on the tip of a pole. *Zizhu* is pronounced *zishu* (淄殊). *Tiao* is pronounced *diao* (调). If I stack three pellets and they do not fall, I lose one-tenth. If I stack five pellets and they do not fall, it is as effortless as plucking. [Note] With the hand perfectly steady, nothing is lost.\n\nMy stance is like a severed tree stump. [Note] Cui Zhuan said: *Juezhuju* (厥株驹) means a broken tree. *Shiwen* writes *juezhuju* (厥株驹) as *juezhuju* (厥株驹), noting: *Jue* is sometimes written as *jue* (橛), pronounced *qiyue* (其月切). The *Shuowen* writes it as *jue* (厥), meaning the base of a tree. Li Yi said: *Jue* means a stump. *Zhuju* also refers to the base of a withered tree. *Ju* is pronounced *ju* (俱). Cui Zhuan, whose courtesy name was Quan, was a native of Qinghe. He served as Gentleman of Discussion during the Jin dynasty and annotated the twenty-seven inner and outer chapters of the *Nanhua Zhenjing*. Ren Dachun said: Modern texts write it as *jue* (厥), which is interchangeable with *jue* (厥). The *Xunzi Dalu* states: \"A harmonious jade disk is like the *jue* (厥) of a wellside.\" The new collated edition reads *jue* as *jue* (厥), meaning the jade is as cheap as a stump. This corroborates Jing Shun’s *Shiwen*, where *jue* (厥) is written as *jue* (厥). Further evidence comes from the *Lüshi Chunqiu*: \"The mechanism of *yijue* (佁蹶)\"—the commentary explains: \"*Jueji* (蹶机) refers to the position inside a gate. The *Book of Songs* says, 'Not far from you, you see me off at the threshold'—this means no farther than the *jue* (厥).\" Thus, *yijue* (佁蹶) is the same as the gate’s *jue* (厥). *Jue* (厥) is interchangeable with *jue* (厥) and also with *jue* (蹶). Additionally, *zhuju* (株驹) appears in the *Zhuangzi Dasheng* as *zhujou* (株拘). The *Shiwen* cites Li [Yi] as saying: \"*Jue* (厥) means a stump, like *zhujou* (株拘).\" The *Yilin* states: \"Meng grows *zhuqu* (株瞿), thorns snag my beard.\" Since it mentions \"Meng grows\" and \"thorns,\" these too are types of trees. *Zhuju* (株驹), *zhujou* (株拘), and *zhuqu* (株瞿) are all phonetic variations of the same term. Further evidence comes from the *Shanhai Jing*: \"Below are the Nine *Ju* (拘)\"—the commentary explains: \"Their roots are tangled.\" The *Huainanzi* says: \"Great roots are *jue* (擢).\" Pronounced *qu* (劬). Thus, *ju* (驹), *ju* (拘), *qu* (瞿), *ju* (枸), and *□* all carry the meaning of a tree’s tangled base.\n\nMy arm is like the branch of a withered tree. Wang Shumin said: There should be a *ye* (也) after \"I grasp my arm,\" to match the structure of the preceding sentence. The *Zhuangzi Dasheng* indeed includes *ye* (也). Though heaven and earth are vast and the myriad things are numerous, I am aware only of the cicada’s wings. I do not turn or shift my focus; I do not exchange the cicada’s wings for the myriad things. How could I fail to succeed?\"\n\n[Note] Guo Xiang said: By relinquishing that, one attains this.\n[Explanation] Initially, when learning to stack pellets, one does not succeed. After half a year of practice, one can stack two without their falling. With continued practice, why can one eventually stack five without their falling? My body is like a stump, my arm like withered wood, my mind single-minded and fixed, free from distracting thoughts. Though the myriad things are many, my awareness rests solely on the cicada’s wings. How could I fail to succeed?\n\nBo Jun noted: *Ce* (侧), *yi* (翼), and *de* (得) rhyme, all belonging to the ancient *zhide* (职德) rhyme group.\n\nConfucius turned to his disciples and said: \"When the mind is undivided, it approaches the divine.\"\n[Note] *Fen* (分) means scattered. When intent is focused, it resembles the divine.\nLu Wenchang said: The *Zang* edition writes *yi* (疑) as *ning* (凝), as does the *Zhuangzi*.\nJiao Xun said: The *Guanzi Neiye* states: \"Think and think again, then think once more. If thinking does not lead to understanding, ghosts and spirits will make it clear. It is not the power of ghosts and spirits but the culmination of essence and *qi*.\" Thinking repeatedly is \"using the mind without division.\" \"Ghosts and spirits will make it clear\" is \"approaching the divine.\"\nYu Yue said: The *Daozang* edition writes *yi* (疑) as *ning* (凝), as does Lu Chongxuan’s edition and the *Zhuangzi*. However, this character should actually be *yi* (疑), meaning \"to astonish like ghosts and spirits.\" The earlier passage where Confucius says, \"I took you for a ghost, but upon closer inspection, you are human,\" also supports the reading \"approaching the divine.\" The *Guanzi Xingshi* states: \"Without breadth, it is *yi* (疑).\" The *Shenjie* says: \"Using compass and square to make circles and squares brings success; using measuring tools to determine length brings accuracy; governing the people with laws and numbers brings peace. Thus, affairs not broad in principle succeed as if by divine means.\" This is precisely what \"using the mind without division approaches the divine\" means. For further discussion, see *Zhuangzi Pingyi*.\nTao Hongqing said: Yu Yue’s argument is sound. Zhang’s commentary states: \"When intent is focused, it resembles the divine,\" indicating that the text he saw originally read *yi* (疑), not *ning* (凝).\nWang Shumin said: The *Yungu Yaji* and *Tianzhong Ji* also write it as *yi* (疑). *Yi* (疑) means \"to resemble.\" The *Zhuangzi Tiandi* states: \"You are not one of those broadly learned men who resemble the sages.\"\n\nThe *Huainanzi*'s \"Chuzhen\" chapter also writes it as *yi* (疑), which is precisely this comparison.\n\nBo Jun notes: Tao Hongqing used Zhang’s commentary as evidence, supplementing what Yu Yue had not fully addressed. In fact, Yu Yue in his *Zhuangzi Pingyi* had already cited this as corroboration. Moreover, the phrase \"resembling\" as used by Confucius became a set expression, which is why the various masters all employ this wording. Ancient set expressions often featured rhyme, and here *shen* (神) and *nai* (乃) form a *zhen-wen* rhyme (as in *Laozi* Chapter 15, where *chuan* [川] and *lin* [邻] rhyme; the *Liji*'s \"Kongzi Xianju,\" where *shen* [神] and *xian* [先] rhyme; the *Book of Songs*' \"Zhengyue,\" where *lin* [邻] and *yin* [殷] rhyme; the *Yijing*'s \"Song\" hexagram, where *ren* [人] and *chuan* [川] rhyme; the *Chuci*'s \"Tianwen,\" where *fen* [分] and *shen* [神] rhyme; the \"Yuan You,\" where *tian* [天] and *wen* [闻] rhyme; and the *Xunzi*'s \"Yun Fu,\" where *sun* [损], *wen* [文], *shen* [神], *men* [门], *cun* [存], and *chen* [陈] rhyme—examples are too numerous to list exhaustively). *Zhen* belongs to Duan Yucai’s twelfth rhyme group, and *wen* to the thirteenth, making their rhyme the closest possible, which is the principle at work here.\n\nCould this be what the hunchbacked elder meant?\n\n**[Explanation]**\nTo focus the mind without distraction is to *congeal* in spiritual union. The Master, however, referred to the elder’s failure to forget the cicada’s wings, hence \"congealing in the divine\"—not that he had attained spiritual union.\n\nThe elder said: \"You are but a disciple in flowing robes.\"\nSun Yirang notes: *Fengyi* (逢衣) refers to the wide-sleeved robes described in the ritual classics. Zheng Xuan’s commentary on the *Zhouli*’s \"Sifu\" states: \"The sleeves of a *shi*’s robe are two *chi* and two *cun* in length, joined to the garment, with cuffs of one *chi* and two *cun*. For *dafu* and above, the sleeves are made wider. To widen them, one takes half the original measurement and adds one part. Thus, the sleeves become three *chi* and three *cun*, and the cuffs one *chi* and eight *cun*.\" The *Shiwen* reads *ru* (汝) as *nü* (女), glossing it as *ru* (汝). The *Liji*’s \"Ruxing\" chapter states: \"When I lived in Lu in my youth, I wore robes with wide sleeves. When I lived long in Song, I wore the *Zhangfu* cap.\" Zheng Xuan’s commentary explains: \"*Feng* means 'large,' referring to robes with wide sleeves.\" Xiang Xiu said: \"Confucian robes are broad and long.\" What do you know of such matters? Cultivate your own means, and only then speak of loftier things.\n\nThe annotation states: *Xiu* (修) means \"to cultivate.\" It speaks of cultivating the arts of benevolence and righteousness that you employ, returning to the natural Dao, and only then may you bear these words upon yourself.\n\nThe exegesis reads: The disciples of the Master are all scholars of the *fengye* robe, employing benevolence and righteousness to teach and transform the world. Yet they cause the world to clamor after fame and profit, exhausting their wisdom and thoughts, losing their true nature, and wearying their spirit and clarity—what do they know of inquiring into this Dao? You who transmit texts to later generations, do you again wish to employ the eloquence of clever speech to bear this Dao upon written words?\n\nQin Enfu said: The final character *ran* (然) in the exegesis is likely a scribal error for *yan* (焉).\nYu Yue said: Zhang’s annotation does not grasp the meaning. Reflecting on the old man’s words, his disdain for Confucian arts is extreme—how could he urge one to cultivate such arts? *Xiu* (修) means \"to sweep away.\" The *Zhouli*’s \"Dian Si\" states: \"He leads his subordinates in sweeping away [impurities],\" and Zheng’s commentary explains: \"*Xiu chu* means to clear and sweep,\" which is its meaning here. The \"Si Zun Yi\" further states: \"*Xiu zhuo*,\" and the commentary of the Minister of Agriculture reads: \"To wash the ladle with water and then pour.\" That washing with water is called *xiu* also carries the sense of sweeping away. Thus, this passage’s *xiu ru suo yi* means that what you employ should be swept away, and only then may you bear my words upon yourself.\nWang Shumin said: Master Yu is correct in taking *xiu* as *xiu chu* (\"to sweep away\"), but he has not grasped the meaning of *zai* (載). *Zai* means \"again.\" It speaks of sweeping away what you formerly employed, and only then may you speak of loftier things again.\nLin Xiyi’s *Kouyi* states: \"*Zai yan* means to speak anew,\" which best captures its meaning. The *Zhuangzi*’s \"Rang Wang\" chapter reads: \"The Master was twice expelled from Lu,\" and the *Taiping Yulan* (486) cites it as *zai*, providing evidence that *zai* and *zai* (\"again\") are interchangeable.\nWu Kaisheng also said: It speaks of first cultivating what you practice and only then seeking loftier things—Zhang’s annotation is in error.\n\nThere was a man from the seaside who was fond of gulls. (Bo Jun notes: The *Lüshi Chunqiu*’s \"Jing Yu\" chapter reads \"fond of dragonflies,\" and the same below.) The *Shiwen* reads: *Hao* (好) is pronounced *hu bao*. *Ou* is pronounced *ou*. Gulls are water owls; those seen today by rivers and lakes, resembling white pigeons and flying in flocks, are they. Each morning he went to the seashore, following the gulls in their play, and the gulls that came numbered in the hundreds without cease.\nThe annotation states: When the heart is harmonious and the form compliant, creatures do not shun one. *Zhu* (住) should be written as *shu* (数).\n\nWang Shumin said: The *Yiwen Leiju* (92), *Taiping Yulan* (925), *Erya Yi* (17), *Rongzhai Sibi* (14), *Jizuan Yuanhai* (56), *Shiwen Leiju Fuxi* (46), *Hebi Shilei Bieji* (69), *Yunfu Qunyu* (8), and *Tianzhong Ji* (59) all quote it as *shu* (数). The *Shiwen* notes: *Zhu* (住) is pronounced *shu* (数).\n\nHis father said, \"I have heard that all the gulls follow you in play. Bring them here so that I may enjoy them.\" The *Shiwen* notes: In one version, \"bring them here\" is written as \"you may bring them here.\"\n\nThe next day, when he went to the seashore, the gulls danced in the air but would not descend.\nThe annotation states: When the heart stirs within, the form changes without; even birds perceive it—how could human principles be feigned?\n\nBo Jun notes: The *Annotations to the Records of the Three Kingdoms* in the *Biography of Gao Rou* quote Sun Sheng as saying, \"When the mind harbors calculation, gulls will not descend.\" Thus, the story of gulls originally existed, and the forger of the *Liezi* borrowed it. Sun Sheng was nearly contemporary with Zhang Zhan and likely never saw this *Liezi*. Hence it is said: Perfect words transcend speech. The *Shiwen* notes: *Qu* (去) is pronounced *qǔ* (丘吕切). Perfect action is non-action. What is known by the equalization of wisdom is but shallow.\nThe annotation states: Only when all speech is forgotten do things harbor no suspicion. To be limited by what wisdom knows is to miss the mark by far.\n\nSome have doubted whether the old man feigned his form to catch cicadas, while the seaside boy, trusting in harmony, drew gulls to him—these two cases seem opposed yet equally avoid offending things. The foundation of their words lies in their distinct purposes. Though they appear contradictory, they converge in the same truth: the old man demonstrated that when the mind is single-mindedly focused, one can avoid startling creatures—how much more so when one attains natural oblivion, becoming like wood or stone? As for the seaside boy, his sincere heart filled his inner being, and his openness manifested outwardly. Though he did not forget both benefit and harm or eliminate all suspicion, he lightly regarded the strangeness of other species, finding little to marvel at. These two analogies borrow the near to illustrate the distant, using the branch to clarify the root.\n\nThe explanation states: Spiritual union transcends reason, not emotional knowledge. When knowledge arises, even flesh and blood suspect one another; when principle arises, all things are without barrier—only then can one discern the subtlest truths. To unite with all things lies in spiritual union; to unite with living beings lies in the extinction of emotion. To pride oneself on one’s heart and wisdom is to distance oneself from the Dao.\n\nThe annotation’s \"the old man feigned his form\" (*wei*, 为) is written as *wei* (伪, \"falsely\") in the Northern Song edition and the Zang edition; the version with *wei* (为) has greater meaning. The *Shiwen* notes: *Qi* (齐) is pronounced *zhì* (在诣切). *Wu* (忤) is pronounced *wù* (悟). *Hai* (骇) is pronounced *xié* (谐楷切), the same below.\n\nViscount Xiang of Zhao led a retinue of one hundred thousand to hunt in Zhongshan.\nThe annotation states: Hunting with fire is called *shou* (狩).\nWang Chongmin said: The *Taiping Yulan* (51) and *Yiwen Leiju* (80) both quote \"Zhongshan\" as \"in the mountains.\" Bo Jun notes: Zhongshan was known as Xianyu in the Spring and Autumn period and became the state of Zhongshan during the Warring States period, located in present-day Ding County, Baoding region, Hebei. The *Shiwen* notes: Viscount Xiang of Zhao was named Wuxu and was the son of Jianzi. *Shuai* (率) is pronounced *shuài* (所律切). *Tian* (畋) is pronounced *tián* (田).\n\nThe flames spread through the forest on a bed of kindling. The *Shiwen* notes: *jiè* (藉) is pronounced *zài yè qiè* (在夜切). *fén* ( ) is pronounced *ér zhèn qiè* (而振切). When the bedding lies beneath, it is called *jiè* (藉); when the grass is left untrimmed, it is called *fén* ( ). *fán* (燔) is pronounced *fán* (烦) and means \"to burn.\" The blaze fanned out, blazing fiercely for a hundred *li*.\n\nA man emerged from within a stone cliff, rising and falling with the smoke and embers. The *Shiwen* notes: *jìn* (烬) is pronounced *jí rèn qiè* (疾刃切). *shàng* (上) is pronounced *shí zhǎng qiè* (时掌切). The crowd called him a ghostly being. The *Yiwen Leiju* (80) quotes this as \"the crowd called him a ghostly being.\" After the fire passed, he walked out slowly, as if he had never traversed anything at all.\n\nViscount Xiang of Zhao found him strange and detained him. The *Shiwen* notes: *liú* (留) is pronounced *lì jiù qiè* (力救切), meaning to stay and observe him. Upon closer examination: his form, complexion, and seven orifices were those of a man. The *Shiwen* notes: *qiào* (窍) is pronounced *kǒu diào qiè* (口吊切). His breath and voice were those of a man. He asked, \"By what *Dao* do you dwell in stone? By what *Dao* do you enter fire?\"\n\nThe man replied, \"What thing do you call stone? What thing do you call fire?\" The annotation states: This shows he was utterly unaware of stone or fire—what thing could obstruct him?\n\nViscount Xiang said, \"That from which you emerged just now was stone; that which you traversed just now was fire.\" The *Shiwen* notes: *xiàng* (向) is pronounced *xiàng* (向). The man said, \"I do not know.\" The annotation states: His ignorance was so complete that he attained this state.\n\nMarquis Wen of Wei heard of this and asked Zixia, \"What sort of man is he?\" Zixia said, \"From what I have heard of the Master’s words, one who harmonizes attains great unity with things, so that nothing can harm or obstruct him. Roaming through metal and stone, treading water and fire—all are possible.\"\n\nMarquis Wen said, \"Why do you not do this?\" Zixia said, \"To hollow out the heart and cast off knowledge—\" The *Shiwen* notes: *kū* (刳) is pronounced *kū* (枯). *qù* (去) is pronounced *qiū lǚ qiè* (丘吕切). \"—I have not yet been able to do so. Nevertheless, I can speak of it when I have leisure.\" The annotation states: To use the heart to hollow out the heart, to borrow knowledge to cast off knowledge—though the burdens of heart and knowledge may be truly exhausted, the traces of what has been relinquished still remain. This makes clear that the ultimate principle cannot be realized through the use of the heart; speaking of it, however, leaves one with ample leisure.\n\nThe commentary states: The previous chapter spoke of roaming through water without obstruction; this chapter clarifies that fire and stone do no harm. It notes that many are accustomed to water, but few tread fire, lest one’s nature become biased. Thus, it speaks again of fire to elucidate this. One who inwardly forgets his own form and outwardly forgets things does not know what obstructs stone or harms fire.\n\nMarquis Wen, not understanding, raised the question, while Zixia, who had long known, answered well. Thus, Marquis Wen pressed further: since you know it, why do you not practice it? Zixia replied, \"I can speak of it and have more than enough to say; but as for practicing and realizing it, I have not yet attained the ability.\" Qin Enfu notes: In the commentary, \"has not yet attained the ability,\" the character *zhī* (知) may be superfluous. The *Shiwen* notes: *xiá* (暇) is also written as *jiǎ* (假), but is also pronounced as *xiá* (暇).\n\nMarquis Wen said, \"Why does the Master not do it?\" Zixia said, \"The Master is capable of it but chooses not to.\"\n\nMarquis Wen was greatly pleased.\n\n[Annotation] In the world, there are those who are capable of it yet choose not to act, those who are capable of it yet cannot help but act, those who are incapable yet force themselves to act, and those who do not act yet naturally possess the ability. As for the sage—what does he do? What does he not do? What is he capable of? What is he incapable of? He bows and rises with the customs of the world, ascends and descends in accord with things. Extraordinary deeds and wondrous traces are never for a moment displayed; the sublime subtleties within his being are not one in ten thousand perceived.\n\nFrom the beginning of this scroll to this chapter, the Dao of following one’s nature and destiny is made clear: not to be bound by the five emotions, to concentrate the qi and attain suppleness, to be sincere in heart without duality—thus one may pass through water and fire without scorching or drowning, tread upon wood and stone without snagging or stumbling, touch blades and edges without injury or harm, traverse peril and danger without falling or tumbling. The myriad things do not oppose his heart; entering among beasts, he does not disturb their herds. His spirit may wander alone, his body may rise lightly; his ears may hear with perfect clarity, his eyes may see with penetrating illumination.\n\nThese words are not conventional, and in truth they startle the common mind. Therefore, let us discuss it: Yin and Yang transform in alternation, the Five Agents nurture in imbalance. Metal and Earth give birth as mother and child; Water and Fire overcome one another through dryness and moisture. Human nature diverges in stillness and agitation; ascent and descent differ in their capacities and dispositions. Thus there are winged creatures that soar through clouds, scaled creatures that lurk in the depths, rats that move through fire, and insects that dwell in wood. Why is this? Hard and soft, heat and cold—each has its proper place.\n\nThose content with one domain are constrained in all others. As for the perfected person, their mind merges mystically with primordial qi, their body harmonizes darkly with Yin and Yang. Squares and circles do not conform to a single form, warmth and coolness do not settle in a single vessel. With spirit settled and qi harmonized, all they ride submits to them—thus the Five Agents cannot oppose them, cold and heat cannot harm them. This is called the depth of embodied virtue, the perfection of harmony. Therefore, they constantly dwell beyond the realm of death—how could they need to deliberate over approach or withdrawal to preserve wholeness?\n\nTreading water and fire, riding clouds and mist, traversing perilous heights, entering the midst of weapons—these are hardly worth marveling at.\n\n[Annotation] The Master’s abilities that he did not exercise were employed to uphold the Dao of benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and the proper order of ruler and minister to rescue a declining age—not merely to cultivate his own person among flocks of birds and beasts.\n\n[Collation Notes] Zhang Hua’s *Bowu Zhi* records this matter in nearly identical terms. Another note: The commentary’s \"perfected person\" appears as \"sage\" in the Shide Tang edition. The *Shiwen* renders  as 碍, with the pronunciation *yue*. 强 is read as *qí liǎng*. 着 is read as *zhí lüè*. 挂 is pronounced *guà*. 碍 originally appeared as . 颠 is read as *dū nián*, meaning \"to fall.\" 偏 is pronounced *piān*. A divine shaman from Qi arrived and resided in Zheng. The *Shiwen* states: males are called *xí*, females *wū*. Yan Shigu notes: *wū* and *xí* are also used interchangeably. His name was Ji Xian. [Collation] The *Xunzi*’s \"Zhengming\" chapter reads, \"Only then does one follow and name it,\" and \"If the reality is not understood, then name it; if the name is not understood, then set a time\"—Yang’s commentary interprets *ming* as \"name\" in both cases. The *Zhuangzi*’s \"Dazongshi\" chapter reads, \"There is nothing with which to name it,\" and the *Shiwen* cites Cui’s commentary: \"*Ming* means name.\" The *Zuozhuan* under Duke Huan’s second year states, \"The ruler named the heir *Chou* and his younger brother *Chengshi*,\" and under the sixth year, \"At his birth, he was of the same kind as I, so I named him *Tong*.\" In all cases, *ming* is glossed as \"name.\" Thus *ming yue Ji Xian* means his name was Ji Xian. Another note: The *Huainanzi*’s \"Dixing Xun\" states, \"Wu Xian is in the north,\" with Gao’s commentary: \"Wu Xian knows the Dao of Heaven and clarifies good and ill fortune.\" The *Shiwen* states: Ji Xian, with the surname Ji and given name Xian, was a man of Zheng. [Collation] The *Zhuangzi*’s \"Ying Diwang\" chapter reads, \"In Zheng there was a divine shaman named Ji Xian,\" and the *Huainanzi*’s \"Jingshen Xun\" reads, \"The divine shaman of Zheng, Xiang Huqiuzi Lin, saw his signs\"—hence the *Shiwen* identifies Ji Xian as a man of Zheng. He knew the life and death, survival and demise, fortune and misfortune, long life and early death of others, predicting them by year, month, ten-day week, or day with divine accuracy. The *Tianzhong Ji* (vol. 40) and *Jingchuan Baibian* (vol. 65) both insert a \"之\" after \"知人.\" Wang Xianqian says: Whether by year, month, ten-day week, or day, none failed to prove divinely accurate. [Collation] Wang’s reading of \"ten-day week and day\" as a single phrase is incorrect. Each of \"year,\" \"month,\" \"ten-day week,\" and \"day\" stands alone, meaning predictions could be made by any of these. When the people of Zheng saw him, they all fled to avoid him. [Commentary] Xiang Xiu says: They disliked hearing their own death dates. The *Shiwen* notes: One variant reads \"abandoned\" instead of \"avoided.\" 喜 is pronounced *xǐ jì*. Liezi saw him and was enchanted. [Commentary] Xiang Xiu says: He was bewildered by his Dao. Returning, he told Huqiuzi, [Commentary] The *Shiwen* states: Huzi was Liezi’s teacher. saying, \"At first I took the Master’s Dao as ultimate, but now there is something even more ultimate.\" [Commentary] Guo Xiang says: He meant that Ji Xian’s attainment surpassed even the Master’s. The *Shiwen* notes: 过 is pronounced *gē*. Huqiuzi said: \"I have practiced the outward forms with you, but you have not yet grasped their essence—how could you have truly attained the Dao? [Collation] Lu Wenchang says: The \"无\" in the Zang edition appears as \"既\"; the commentary suggests \"无\" may be correct, though the *Zhuangzi* also uses \"既.\" Yu Yue says: \"无\" should be \"\", read as *guàn* (to penetrate), as \"贯\" and \"\" were originally the same character. The *Erya*’s \"Shigu\" glosses *guàn* as \"to practice.\" The *Huangdi* chapter reads, \"You and I have long played with its outward forms but have not yet reached its essence,\" with the *Shiwen* glossing *wán* (玩) as *xí guàn* (习贯, to practice). Thus here \"\" (practice) corresponds to *wán* (玩) there—both are phonetically close and share the same meaning. Due to scribal error, it became \"\", and later scholars replaced it with \"无,\" rendering the passage unintelligible. Lu Chongxuan’s edition reads \"既其文未既其实,\" following the *Zhuangzi*’s revision, but this is not the original text of the *Liezi*. Wang Shuqin says: \"I have practiced the outward forms with you, but you have not yet grasped their essence\"—whether \"既\" or \"无,\" the meaning remains unclear. The earlier passage where Yan Hui asks the ferryman about boat-handling reads, \"You and I have long played with its outward forms but have not yet reached its essence\"—*wán* (玩) is the superior reading. It is likely that \"既\" here is a corruption of *wán* (玩), and the second \"既\" should also be *wán*. The \"无\" variant arose when *wán* (玩) degraded into *yuán* (元), and scribes altered it to \"无.\" The *Shiwen* notes: \"无\" appears as \"无\" in some editions, while others use \"既,\" though the latter is less meaningful. A flock of hens without a rooster—how could they lay eggs?\" [Commentary] Xiang Xiu says: Essence is made manifest through form, and the Dao is revealed through affairs. To possess the Dao without engaging in affairs is like having hens without a rooster. Though you and I differ in depth, we both occupy the realm of essence—thus no outward forms emerge to reveal it. Therefore, you have not yet fully grasped the essence of my Dao. This speaks to how the perfected person’s song must await a response before harmonizing. [Collation] The *Huainanzi*’s \"Lanming Xun\" states: \"Thus the utmost Yin is howling, the utmost Yang is blazing—when the two interact and harmonize, the myriad things are born.\"\n\n\"With a flock of roosters but no hen—how could transformation ever arise?\"\n\n*Shiwen* notes: \"卵 is read *luǎn* (short tone).\"\nSima [Biao] says: \"You have not yet fully received instruction, so you remain unformed. Just as a flock of hens without a rooster produces no eggs, so too does your state yield nothing.\"\n\"Yet to oppose the world with the Dao is surely trustworthy.\"\n\n*Shiwen* notes: \"抗 is read *kàng* (rising tone); some write it as 亢, with the same pronunciation.\"\n\n\"Thus others can perceive and assess you.\"\n\n[Commentary] Xiang Xiu says: \"To rigidly uphold one aspect and insist on its trustworthiness in the world is to make yourself perceptible to others.\"\n\n[Exegesis] When Liezi met the Zheng shaman, he was intoxicated in heart, for the man could discern life and death, fortune and misfortune, and seemed to exhaust the Dao in this alone. Master Huqiu said: \"You and I have merely lost our outward traces—we have not yet fully grasped its true principle. How could you have attained my Dao? To still the spirit and quiet the mind is like the state of hens; to act, employ, and achieve success is like the rooster. You now cease affairs to calm the mind—how can you seek eggs without a rooster? Yet you would pit the utmost Dao against a common shaman, and so your deep conviction makes you known even to spirits.\"\n\n*Shiwen* notes: \"相 is read *xiàng* (falling tone).\"\n\n\"Come with me tomorrow, and I will show you.\"\n\n*Shiwen* notes: \"示 is written as , read *shì* (falling tone).\"\n\nThe next day, Liezi brought the shaman to see Master Hu. Upon leaving, the shaman said to Liezi: \"Alas!\n\n*Shiwen* notes: \"嘻 is read *xī* (rising tone).\"\n\nYour master is dead. He cannot be revived—he will not last ten days. I saw something strange in him: I saw damp ashes.\"\n\nLiezi entered, his tears soaking his lapels as he reported this to Master Hu.\n\n*Shiwen* notes: \"司馬云: *qi* like damp ashes.\"\n\n*Shiwen* notes: \"衿 originally written as 衾.\"\nYu Yue says: \"衾 should be 衿, the same as 襟.\"\nThe *Yingdiwang* chapter of the *Zhuangzi* indeed reads: \"his tears soaked his lapels.\"\nWang Chongmin says: \"The Jifu edition correctly writes 衿.\"\nBo Jun notes: \"Here we follow the Jifu edition.\"\n\nMaster Hu said: \"Earlier, I showed him *Earthly Pattern*.\"\n\n*Annotation*: Xiang Xiu says: \"Like a clod of earth.\"\n*Shiwen* notes: \"向吾 in one version reads 庸吾, the same below.\"\n\n\"[I was] sprouting yet unmoved, unceasing.\"\n\n*Annotation*: \"罪 in some versions reads 萌.\"\nXiang Xiu says: \"Sprouting yet unmoving, neither halting of itself—like a withered tree sharing its lack of bloom, like dead ashes sharing their stillness of spirit. This is the time when the utmost person is without response. The utmost person’s movement is like Heaven, their stillness like Earth, their action like flowing water, their depth like a silent abyss. The silent abyss and flowing water, Heaven’s movement and Earth’s stillness—all are one in their non-doing and natural spontaneity. Now, Jixian saw him dwelling like a corpse and sitting in oblivion, and so called him near death; he saw his spirit move and Heaven follow, and so called him alive. If one responds to stimuli without intent, then rises and falls with change, taking the world as measure—only then can one master things and follow the timeless without limit. How could a diviner perceive this?\"\n\n*Annotation*: \"其静也地 in the Northern Song edition reads 土; Wang’s edition follows this. Here we follow the Zang edition to correct it.\"\n\"謂之有生: 謂 in all other editions reads 為. Here we also follow the Zang edition to correct it.\"\n\nYu Yue says: \"罪 should be read as □.\"\nThe *Shuowen*, in its *Shan* section, writes □, saying: \"The appearance of a mountain.\" This is correct.\n*Shiwen* notes: \"罪 originally read 萌. The Lu Chongxuan edition also reads 萌, later altered according to the *Zhuangzi*. 萌 is a corrupted form of 罪. For details, see *Zhuangzi Pingyi*.\"\nWang Shumin says: \"Reading 罪 as □ is forced. Here, 萌 is correct. 萌 has the sense of arising (the *Chu Zhen* chapter of the *Huainanzi*: 'Who knows where it arises?' with the note: '萌 means to arise'). '萌乎不震不止' means 'arising in unmoving unceasing,' directly countering the earlier 'Your master is dead.' The meaning is quite clear. 罪 is an error.\"\n\nThe *Shiwen* states: \"罪 originally reads 萌.\" \"震 is pronounced as 振.\" Cui Zhuan says: \"不震不止 means like moving yet unmoving.\" \"量 is pronounced as 亮.\" \"This is nearly seeing my concealed virtue-power.\"\n\n**Annotation:**\nXiang Xiu says: \"Virtue-power does not manifest, hence it is called concealed.\"\n\n**Explication:**\nThe numinous spirits of ghosts and gods can know the thoughts of human activity. If one has attachments, ghosts will perceive them. Master Hu’s countenance abided in \"damp ashes,\" his mind fixed on the soil, sprouting without deliberation—hence it is called \"earthly pattern.\" When stirred, it becomes life; when still, it merges into obscurity—thus it is said \"unmoving yet unceasing.\"\n\nQin Enfu says: \"In the explication, '天文' should read '地文.'\"\n\n\"Come again tomorrow!\"\n\nThe next day, he again brought him to see Master Hu. Upon leaving, he said to Liezi: \"Fortunate indeed is your master to have met me—he is recovering! He is ashen yet sprouting. There is life! I have seen his concealed dynamism.\"\n\n**Annotation:**\nHaving function yet no advantage, hence it is called \"concealed dynamism.\"\n\nLiezi entered and reported this to Master Hu. Master Hu said: \"Earlier, I showed him heaven-and-earth, where the power of covering and bearing is manifest. Compared to earthly pattern, is this not external?\n\n**Annotation:**\nTaohong Qing says: The *Shuowen* states: \"壤 means soft soil.\" The *Book of Documents* (*Yu Gong*) says: \"Its soil is white 壤.\" Ma Rong’s note: \"Naturally harmonious and fine.\" The *Rites of Zhou* (*Da Situ*) says: \"Distinguishing the twelve kinds of 壤.\" Zheng Xuan’s note: \"壤 means the appearance of harmony and gentleness.\" Thus, \"heaven-and-earth\" takes the meaning of harmony and softness. Stated plainly, it is \"heavenly harmony.\" This and \"earthly pattern\" are both figurative expressions. Zhang’s annotation, taking \"heaven-and-earth\" as \"heaven and earth,\" is quite difficult to reconcile.\n\nWang Shumin says: The annotation \"compared to earthly pattern\" in the *Zhuangzi* *Ying Di Wang* chapter reads \"compared to *this* earthly pattern\"—this should be followed. Here, the characters \"之地\" are mistakenly inverted.\n\nThe *Shiwen* states: \"見 is pronounced as 贤遍切.\"\n\n\"Names and realities do not enter, yet the mechanism springs from the heels.\"\n\n**Annotation:**\nGuo Xiang says: \"It constantly arises from the utmost point.\"\n\nThe *Shiwen* states: Xu Shen’s annotation to the *Huainanzi* says: \"機發不旋踵 means the mechanism springs without turning the heels.\"\n\n\"This is concealed dynamism. This is nearly seeing my good aspect.\"\n\n**Annotation:**\nXiang Xiu says: \"If there is goodness in him, he will perceive it. Clearly, Ji Xian’s perception was shallow.\"\n\n**Explication:**\nHaving dynamism yet not employing it is called \"concealed.\" Like heaven’s covering, though its power is unseen, it rises from below. As names and realities have not entered, it is said \"there is life.\"\n\n\"Come again tomorrow!\"\n\nThe next day, he again brought him to see Master Hu.\n\nListening, he went out and said to Liezi: \"Your master is not in a state of fasting—\"\n\n**Annotation:**\nSome versions omit the character \"坐\" (sitting).\nXiang Xiu says: \"Wherever one goes, all is level, merged into oneness. Those who peer at heaven through a tube see no bounds; thus, he is not in a state of fasting.\"\n\nLu Wenchang notes: The annotation \"管\" appears as \"筦\" in the *Zang* edition. Below \"故以,\" a \"为\" should be added.\nThe *Shiwen* writes \"斋\" as \"齐,\" pronounced *zhāi* (侧皆切), with the same pronunciation below.\n\n\"I can find nothing by which to assess him. Try fasting, and I will observe him again later.\"\n\nLiezi entered and reported this to Master Hu. Master Hu said: \"Just now, I showed him the Great Vastness without trace—\"\n\n**Annotation:**\nXiang Xiu says: \"Abiding in the utmost of the Great Vastness, the mind is vast and still, darkly one with the ten thousand directions, leaving no trace.\"\nThe *Shiwen* writes \"太\" as \"大,\" pronounced *tài*. *眹* is pronounced *zhěn* (直引切), meaning \"sign.\"\n\n\"This is nearly seeing my balanced qi.\"\n\n**Annotation:**\n*衡* means \"level.\"\n\n\"Where the *ní* fish coils—\"\n\n**Annotation:**\nPronounced *fān*.\n\n\"—is the abyss.\" Ji Di says: \"*潘* should be *沈*, the character for *shěn*. *沈* is the original form of *湛*. The *Shuowen* states: *湛* means \"to submerge.\" By extension, it carries the sense of depth. *沈* and *湛* are ancient and modern forms; today, *沈* is commonly used for *湛*. *渊*, according to the *Shuowen*, is \"revolving water,\" depicted with water radicals, its shape suggesting banks on either side and water in the center. The *Guanzi*’s *Du Di* chapter states: \"Water that emerges from the earth but does not flow is called an abyss.\" Thus, an abyss is where water pools and deepens. The *Shijing*’s *Wei Feng* commentary glosses *渊* as \"deep,\" and *沈* as an abyss further emphasizes this depth. The *Liji*’s *Tan Gong* reads: \"For the *yú* tree’s *shěn*, a dredge was set,\" where *shěn* is *shěn*. Here, however, *shěn* is *shěn*. *Zhuangzi* writes it as *审*. When *沈* is missing a stroke, it becomes *潘*; when *水* is missing, it becomes *审*. Errors arise easily, but the traces remain discernible.\n\nThe *Shiwen* writes \"旋\" as \"桓,\" pronounced *huán* (胡官切), meaning \"to linger.\" One version writes it as *旋*, meaning \"to coil.\" *潘* is pronounced *pān*; originally *蟠*, referring to the swirling of water. Now written as *蟠*, likely a scribal error. *鲵* is a large fish; *桓* means \"to linger\"; *蟠* means \"to swirl.\" This describes how a great fish’s lingering and coiling creates a deep spring. The *Nanhua Zhenjing* writes it as *审*. Liang Jianwen states: *蟠* means \"to gather.\" Ren Dachun notes: Mountains and waters named *桓* all carry the sense of coiling. The *Shui Jing Zhu* states: \"*桓* is the name of a mountain slope; its path coils and winds upward, hence the name *桓*.\" Slopes named *桓* and waters named *桓* both derive from the sense of coiling, corroborating the *Shiwen*’s *旋* written as *桓*. The words *盘桓* were often glossed as \"to revolve\" in ancient times. The *Yi*’s *Zhun* *Shiwen*, citing Ma Rong, states: \"*盘桓* means 'to revolve.'\" Thus, the *桓* in *盘桓* in the *Liezi* is also written as *旋*. Further, in the *Zhuangzi*’s *Ying Di Wang* *Shiwen*, *鲵桓* is glossed by Sima Biao as \"two fish names,\" while Jianwen states: \"*鲵* is the whale; *桓* means 'to linger.'\" Cui’s version writes it as *鲵拒*, glossing it as \"the square cave where fish dwell.\" Another note states: \"*拒* may be written as *桓*.\" Thus, *鲵桓*’s *桓* is written as *旋* in the *Liezi* *Shiwen* and as *拒* in the *Zhuangzi* *Shiwen*.\n\nAnother note: Lu Jingshun’s *Shiwen* states that *潘* was originally *蟠*, referring to the swirling of water, and that the current *蟠* is likely a scribal error. However, this interpretation is somewhat forced. The *蟠* in \"now written as *蟠*\" may be a corruption of *潘*. Yet in the *Zhuangzi*’s *Ying Di Wang* *Shiwen*, *鲵桓*’s *审* is glossed by Sima Biao as *蟠*, meaning \"to gather,\" while Cui’s version writes it as *潘*, glossing it as \"the domain where swirling water congeals.\" The *Guanzi*’s *Wu Fu* chapter states: \"Guide floodwaters, benefit ponds and ditches, and dredge *潘* islets,\" with the annotation: \"*潘* means 'to overflow.' *渚潘* overflows, so dredge them to allow flow. *潘* is pronounced *pān*.\" The supplementary annotation states: *潘* refers to swirling overflow. The *Guangya* states: \"*潘* is *fúyuán*, meaning 'to surge.'\" Thus, *蟠* and *潘* each have their basis and are not incorrect. It remains unclear which character the *蟠* in Lu Jingshun’s *Shiwen* is a corruption of.\n\nFurther, the *Yupian* states: \"*瀊* means 'to swirl,'\" from which Lu Jingshun’s *Shiwen* derives its *瀊洄*. The *Guanzi*’s *Xiao Wen* chapter writes it as *盘桓*.\n\n\"—where still water pools is an abyss; where flowing water pools is an abyss; where overflowing water pools is an abyss—\"\n\n**Annotation:**\n*滥* is pronounced with the rising tone (咸上声). The *Erya* states: \"Water gushes forth.\"\n\n\"—where cascading water pools is an abyss—\"\n\n**Annotation:**\n*沃* is pronounced *wù* (乌仆切), referring to water springing from above and flowing downward.\n\n\"—where lateral springs pool is an abyss—\"\n\n**Annotation:**\n*氿* is pronounced *guǐ* (轨), referring to water springing from the side.\n\n\"—where dammed water pools is an abyss—\"\n\n**Annotation:**\n*雍* is pronounced *yōng* (拥), referring to river water bursting forth and then returning.\n\n\"—where stagnant water pools is an abyss—\"\n\n**Annotation:**\nPronounced *qiān* (牵), referring to water that does not flow.\n\n\"—where fertile water pools is an abyss—\"\n\n**Annotation:**\nWater with unusual origins is called *肥*.\n\n\"—these are the Nine Abysses.\"\n\n**Annotation:**\nThe names and meanings of these nine waters appear in the *Erya*. Water is one, yet depending on whether the terrain is high or low, smooth or rugged, it swirls, rushes, flows, or stills differently—just as the mind of the perfected person, in response to external things’ difficulty or ease, exhibits movement or stillness, advance or retreat. Xiang Xiu says: \"Whether water flows or stills, whether the *ní* fish coils or the dragon leaps, the abyss remains ever thus, never losing its quietude.\"\n\nGuo Xiang says: \"The perfected person acts when employing the Way and stills when setting it aside. Though waves surge through nine transformations, and order and chaos swirl in confusion, one who abides in the ultimate remains ever tranquil and self-possessed, drifting in non-action.\"\n\n**Explication:**\nThe mind moves with the qi of the Great Thoroughfare, vast and traceless, formless yet ever-shifting—like water assuming myriad names in its transformations, yet never departing from the clarity of the abyss. Thus, its form cannot be grasped or described.\n\n**Annotation:**\n\"Nine transformations\" (*jiǔ biàn*): The Northern Song edition reads \"all transformations\" (*fán biàn*); Wang’s edition follows this, but the present text adopts the Zang edition’s correction.\n**Pronunciations:**\n*Huí* (洄) is pronounced *huí*.\n*Yì* (易) is pronounced *yì* (with the *shì* rhyme).\n*Shě* (舍) is pronounced *shě*.\n*Dàn* (澹) is pronounced *dàn* (with the *làn* rhyme).\n*Bó* (泊) is pronounced *bó*.\n\n\"Come again tomorrow!\"\n\nYu Yue says: The preceding text reads, *\"This must be seeing my power of virtue in its subtlety—come again tomorrow,\"* and again, *\"This must be seeing my goodness in its subtlety—come again tomorrow.\"* Thus, this passage should read, *\"This must be seeing my qi in equilibrium in its subtlety,\"* followed immediately by *\"Come again tomorrow,\"* to maintain consistency. The interpolation of the Nine Abysses here is superfluous. I suspect these fifty-eight characters are a misplaced slip from elsewhere. In the *Zhuangzi*’s *\"The Emperor of the World\"* chapter, only the first three abysses are listed, and it concludes, *\"The abyss has nine names; these are three of them,\"* precisely because they are irrelevant to the passage’s meaning. This confirms that the version of the *Zhuangzi* seen by its author already matched the present text—errors in ancient books are long-standing.\n\nThe next day, he again met with Master Hu. Before he could steady himself, he lost composure and fled.\n\n**Annotation:**\n\"Lost composure and fled\" (*zì shī ér zǒu*): His spirit scattered and he ran.\n\nMaster Hu said: \"Pursue him!\"\nLiezi chased him but could not catch up. Returning, he reported to Master Hu: \"He has vanished! He is lost! I could not reach him.\"\nMaster Hu said: \"Earlier, I showed him what had never yet departed from my source.\"\n\n**Annotation:**\nXiang Xiu says: Though advancing and retreating with the crowd, he ever remains deeply rooted in tranquility.\n\n**Chen Bojun’s note:**\n*\"Never yet departed from my source\"* (*wèi shǐ chū wú zōng*) aligns with the *Zhuangzi*’s *\"not departing from its source\"* and the *Huainanzi*’s *\"never yet departed from its source.\"*\n\n\"I met him with emptiness and yielding compliance.\"\n\n**Annotation:**\nXiang Xiu says: Without intent, one follows change.\n**Correction:**\n\"Yielding compliance\" (*yī yí*): Wang’s edition reads *\"leaning and shifting\"* (*yǐ yí*); the present text follows the Northern Song and Zang editions’ correction.\n\n**Feng Dengfu’s note:**\n\"Yielding compliance\" is *wēi yí* (compliant movement).\n\n**Annotation:**\n*Yī* (猗) is pronounced *yī* (with the *wēi* rhyme).\n\"Yielding compliance\" (*yī yí*) means *\"compliant and shifting,\"* the appearance of utmost compliance.\n\n\"He knew not who or what it was.\"\n\n**Annotation:**\nXiang Xiu says: Floating, unbound to anything.\n**Note:**\nAll editions of the annotation omit the words *\"it is\"* (*zhě yě*) at the end.\n\n**Annotation:**\n*Fàn* (泛) is pronounced *fàn* (with the *jiàn* rhyme).\n\n\"Thus, I made it like withered grass swaying, like waves flowing.\"\n\n**Guang Congxie’s note:**\nAbove, *\"I met him with emptiness and yielding compliance,\"* the annotation explains *\"yielding compliance\"* as *\"the appearance of utmost compliance\"* (here mistakenly attributed to the annotation rather than the *Shiwen*). *\"Withered grass swaying\"* (*máo mǐ*) means like grass bending with the wind, and *\"waves flowing\"* (*bō liú*) means like waves following the current—both describe yielding to things without resistance.\n\n**Hong Yi’s note:**\nIn the *Zhuangzi*’s *\"The Emperor of the World\"* chapter, *\"thus I made it like a compliant younger brother\"* (*yīn yǐ wéi dì mǐ*), the *Shiwen* reads: *\"Compliant younger brother: the appearance of boundlessness. Cui says: like yielding submission.\"* *\"Compliant younger brother\"* is a loan for *\"yielding compliance\"* (*yǐ mǐ*). Here, *\"withered\"* (*máo*) is a corruption due to its graphical similarity to *\"younger brother\"* (*dì*).\n\n**Annotation:**\n*Zhuāngzi* writes *\"withered\"* (*máo*) as *\"younger brother\"* (*dì*), pronounced *tuí*.\n*\"Withered grass swaying\"* (*máo mǐ*): Cui Zhuan says: *\"yielding submission.\"*\n\n**Chen Bojun’s note:**\nThe *Shiwen*’s *\"Zhuangzi writes 'withered'\"* should read *\"writes 'younger brother'.\"*\n\n\"Thus, I made it like waves flowing.\"\n\n**Annotation:**\nThe *Zhuangzi*’s *Shiwen* cites Cui’s edition as *\"waves following\"* (*bō suí*).\n\n**Wang Niansun’s note:**\nCui’s edition is correct. *\"Snake\"* (*shé*), *\"what\"* (*hé*), *\"swaying\"* (*mǐ*), and *\"following\"* (*suí*) form a rhyme.\n\n**Tao Hongqing’s note:**\nSame as above.\n\n\"So he fled.\"\n\n**Annotation:**\n*\"Withered grass swaying\"* should be *\"crumbling and swaying\"* (*tuí mǐ*).\n\n**Xiang Xiu’s note:**\nTransforming and crumbling, worldly affairs flowing like waves—wherever one goes, one follows without acting. Though I do not act, I move with the crowd in harmony. The perfected person is one, yet responds to worldly changes with timely action. Thus, the diviner had no use for his mind and fled in self-loss.\n\n**Explication:**\nAbandoning thought and severing念, one enters non-action. Utterly empty and formless, without visible appearance—like grass swaying, like waves flowing, vast and unbound—beyond the ken of spirit-mediums.\n\nThereafter, Liezi returned home, believing he had never yet begun to learn. For three years, he did not go out.\n\n**Annotation:**\nXiang Xiu says: He abandoned the mundane affairs of human life.\n\nHe cooked for his wife.\n\n**Annotation:**\nXiang Xiu says: He disregarded shame.\n\n**Annotation:**\n*Wéi* (为) is pronounced *wéi* (with the *wěi* rhyme).\n*Cuàn* (爨) is pronounced *cuàn* (with the *wàn* rhyme).\n\nHe fed pigs as he fed people.\n\n**Annotation:**\nXiang Xiu says: He forgot distinctions of noble and base.\n\n**Annotation:**\n*Shí* (食) is pronounced *sì*; the same below.\n*Xī* (狶) is pronounced *xī* (with the *qǐ* rhyme). The people of Chu call pigs *xī*.\n\nHe was impartial in affairs.\n\n**Annotation:**\nXiang Xiu says: Without preference or aversion.\n\n**Chen Bojun’s note:**\nThe *Zhuangzi* reads *\"impartial in affairs, without partiality\"* (*yú shì wú yǔ qīn*).\n\n**Annotation:**\n*Dí* (适) is pronounced *dí* (with the *shì* rhyme).\n\nCarved patterns returned to unworked wood; he stood alone, a mere lump of earth.\n\n**Annotation:**\nXiang Xiu says: The ornamentation of carved patterns returned to true simplicity; thus, external affairs fell away.\n**Note:**\nThe Zang edition reads *\"carved and polished\"* (*diāo zhuó*) for *\"carved patterns\"* (*diāo zhuàn*); the meaning is the same.\n\n**Annotation:**\n*Zhuàn* (瑑) is pronounced *zhuàn* (with the *zhuǎn* rhyme); it is also written *zhuó* (琢).\n\nScattered yet sealed.\n\n**Annotation:**\nXiang Xiu says: His truth was not dispersed.\n**Variant:**\n*Róng* (戎) is also written *zāi* (哉).\n\n**Annotation:**\n*Fēn* (□) is pronounced *fēn*.\n*Zāi* (哉) is also written *róng* (戎), pronounced *zāi*.\n\nHaving thus unified his end.\n\n**Annotation:**\nXiang Xiu says: He thereby attained the Dao.\n\n**Exegesis:**\nHe forgot right and wrong, equated nobility and baseness, leveled self and other, and stilled external entanglements. Unbound by self, he preserved unity to the end, and only then merged with the real.\n\nWhen Master Liezi journeyed toward Qi, he turned back midway.\n\n**Annotation:**\nHe was startled by others’ deference toward himself and dared not proceed.\n\nHe encountered Bohun Maoren. Bohun Maoren asked, “Why have you turned back?”\n\nHe replied, “I was startled.”\n\n“By what?”\n\n**Annotation:**\n*Wū* (恶) is pronounced *wū* (with the *wū* rhyme).\n\n“I ate at ten taverns, and at five of them, they offered me food first.”\n\n**Annotation:**\nEveryone deferred to him.\n\n**Note:**\nWang Chongmin says: The *Taiping Yulan* (861) includes a *yuē* (曰) before the lower *wú* (吾). Likely, both the *wū* (恶) above and the *wú* (吾) below originally had *yuē* (曰), but both are now missing. The *Zhuangzi*’s “Lie Yukou” chapter also includes *ér yuē* (而曰), confirming this.\n\nWang Shumin says: The *Shiwen Leiju Xuxi* (17) and *Hebi Shilei Waiji* (43) also include *yuē* (曰) before *wú* (吾).\n\n**Annotation:**\n*Kuì* (馈) is pronounced *kuì* (with the *wèi* rhyme), meaning “to present food.”\n\nBohun Maoren said, “If that is so, why were you startled?”\n\n**Annotation:**\n*Jǐ* (己) is pronounced *jǐ* (with the *jǐ* rhyme). *Jǐng jǐ* (惊己) means “startled at one’s own loss.” Below, *chù jǐ* (处己) shares the same pronunciation.\n\nHe replied, “When inner sincerity is not released,\n\n**Annotation:**\nGuo Xiang says: Outwardly, he was self-important; inwardly, he remained unreconciled.\n\n**Annotation:**\n*Xiè* (解) is pronounced *xiè* (with the *xiè* rhyme).\nXiang Xiu says: He had not yet attained effortless release.\n\nand one’s demeanor shines with artifice,\n\n**Annotation:**\nGuo Xiang says: His movements were ostentatious, forming a radiant display.\n\n**Annotation:**\n*Dié* (谍) is pronounced *dié* (with the *dié* rhyme).\n*Bì* (辟) is pronounced *bì* (with the *yì* rhyme),\n\none externally overawes others’ minds,\n\n**Annotation:**\nOutwardly, he was imposing and stern, commanding others, but inwardly, he was insufficient.\n\ncausing people to slight the noble and the elder,\n\n**Annotation:**\nPeople slighted and yet revered their elders because his demeanor shone with artifice.\n\n**Annotation:**\n*Zhǎng* (长) is pronounced *zhǎng* (with the *zhàng* rhyme).\n\nand expose their concerns.\n\n**Annotation:**\nGuo Xiang says: By moving others with outward beauty, he invited chaos to arise.\n\n**Note:**\nLu Wenchang says: “□” should be “□.”\nQin Enfu says: □ is the *Shuowen*’s □ character, also written as in the * Yupian*.\n\nWang Chongmin says: The *Taiping Yulan* (861) writes “□” as “察.”\n\n**Annotation:**\n*□* is pronounced *zǐ* (with the *xī* rhyme).\n\nNow, tavern keepers merely sell food and broth for profit—\n\n**Annotation:**\n*Shí* (食) is pronounced *sì* (with the *sì* rhyme).\n\na surplus of excess.\n\n**Annotation:**\nThey sell broth and food, profiting only from the surplus.\n\n**Note:**\nThe Wang edition reads “without surplus excess.” Yu Yue says: The absence of “without” is correct. According to Zhang’s commentary, Zhang’s edition also lacks “without.” The “without” was mistakenly added by a shallow reader. If it read “without surplus excess,” the following line would not need to say their profit was meager.\n\nThe Lu Chongxuan edition lacks “without,” as does the *Zhuangzi*’s “Lie Yukou” chapter; it should be deleted.\n\nWang Chongmin says: Yu’s argument is sound. The Northern Song edition and the *Taiping Yulan* (861) both lack “without.”\n\n**Note:**\nThis edition also lacks “without”; the present translation follows this.\n\n**Annotation:**\nThe *Shiwen* reads “without surplus excess,” noting: *Yíng* (赢) is pronounced *yíng* (with the *yíng* rhyme). One edition lacks “without.”\n\nTheir profit is meager, their influence slight, and yet they act thus. How much more so for a lord of ten thousand chariots, who wearies himself for the state and exhausts his wisdom in affairs?\n\n**Annotation:**\nThe reason he dared not proceed to Qi.\n\nHe would entrust me with tasks and demand results from me. This is why I was startled.”\n\n**Annotation:**\nExtending this logic, those who offer little expect little profit, while those burdened with heavy tasks face greater demands.\n\nBohun Maoren said, “Excellent observation!\n\n**Annotation:**\nThat you were startled by this shows you are a keen observer.\n\nIf you abide in yourself, others will safeguard you.”\n\n**Annotation:**\nIf you remain silent and do not display yourself, whether in Qi or here, you will have nothing to fear. If you violate this principle, you will be safeguarded wherever you go.\n\n**Exegesis:**\nDisplaying one’s demeanor to others causes people to risk death in reverence. Fearing that the lord’s weariness in affairs would lead to entrusting him with responsibilities and demanding results, he was startled and anxious about the increased burden of his stipend.\n\nBohun said: If you can withdraw to preserve your true nature, contain your light to erase your traces, others will safeguard you. Why? The desire to advance goodness resides in all people.\n\nWhere land yields abundant profit, all people vie for it. The nature of the common person may rise or fall. Knowing that fame and gain cannot be forced, one advances goodness to cultivate oneself. The *Odes*, *Documents*, ritual, and music—these affairs are not easily mastered. Yet if one retreats to seclusion, stills the heart and extinguishes cleverness, eschewing the lure of ostentation, one gains the reputation of a good person. Thus, at the gate of Dao-learning, whether one’s inclinations are good or bad, the noble person purifies the heart, while the petty person reforms the self. Though they may not fully grasp the Way, they still derive benefit from following goodness. Hence it is said: “Others will safeguard you.”\n\nWang Lai notes: In the exegesis “risk death in reverence,” *death* should read *prior*. Tao Hongqing says: *Safeguard* means *entrust*; it speaks of others placing trust in one, just as the *Liezi* states, “They will entrust me with affairs and demand results from me.” Zhang’s annotation, glossing it as “safeguarded wherever one goes,” is quite untenable. Wang Chongmin says: In Zhang’s note, “If one violates this principle,” *violates* should read *attains*, an error due to graphic similarity. The *Zhuangzi*’s “Ren Jian Shi” chapter reads, “Timing their hunger and satiety, attaining their angry hearts,” while the *Huainanzi*’s “Zhu Shu” chapter mistakenly writes *violates*—this serves as evidence. Xi Tong says: *Abide* should be glossed as *examine*, as explained in detail in Wang Yinzhi’s *Jingyi Shuwen*. *Abiding in oneself* means examining oneself. The *Shiwen* states: *Safeguard* means *attach*. Before long, he went, and the shoes outside his door were filled. The annotation says: Those who returned to him were indeed many. The *Shiwen* states: *屦* is pronounced *jiu* (nine-meet cut), and in the Guanzhong region, shoes are called *屦*.\n\nBohun Maoren stood facing north, leaning heavily on his staff, pressing it against his chin. The annotation says: *Dun* means *press*. The *Shiwen* states: *Dun* is pronounced *dun* (tone). *Cù* is pronounced *zi-liu* cut. *Yí* is pronounced *yi* (tone). After standing for a while, the *Shiwen* says: *Interval* means a short time. He departed without speaking. The attendant reported this to Liezi.\n\nThe *Shiwen* states: *宾* is written as *傧* in the original text, meaning *to guide*, pronounced *bi-ren* cut. Liezi lifted his shoes and ran barefoot. The *Shiwen* notes: *履* is written as *屦*, with *提* pronounced *ti*. *屦* is also written as *履* in another version. *跣* is pronounced *xian-tian* cut. Upon reaching the gate, the *Shiwen* states: *暨* is pronounced *qi-qi* cut, meaning *to arrive*. He asked: \"Since you have come, Master, have you not dispensed with the remedy?\" The annotation says: *废* means *to set aside*. He has not once offered good words to serve as medicine or stone. The commentary says: *废* should be *发*. Since you have come, Master, why not utter a few words of remedy as instruction? Wang Shumin says: In the *Zhuangzi* *Lie Yukou* chapter, *废* is correctly written as *发*. *废* and *发* were interchangeable in ancient times. In the *Zhongni* chapter: \"If one *发* ignorance, how can there be true nature? If one *发* incapacity, how can anything be done?\" The *Shiwen* cites an alternate version reading \"If one *废* ignorance, if one *废* incapacity,\" which is comparable. The *Shiwen* states: *当* is pronounced *dang-lang* cut. The Master replied: \"Enough.\"\n\n\"Indeed, I told you before: others would preserve you, and they have indeed preserved you. Yet it is not that you can make others preserve you. [Annotation: If one interacts with things in accord with the principle, then things will naturally preserve one. Now, turning against the principle to move things, one seeks their preservation—but it cannot be obtained.] The *Lu Chongxuan* edition of the *Qin* carving omits the character *you* after 'make others preserve.' It is likely that the omission is correct.\" *Shiwen* notes: *bei* is pronounced *pei*.\n\n\"But you cannot make others not preserve you. [Annotation: Guo Xiang says: If one acts with equanimity and transforms, then there is no stirring, no seeking. Without stirring or seeking, there is no mutual preservation.] [Exegesis: Your withdrawal, your integrity, your renunciation of learning and wisdom—these are why others preserve you, not because you can summon them. If you could erase your traces and merge with the real, concealing both foolishness and wisdom, others would not know to preserve you. Thus, your conduct merely suffices to make others preserve you, yet you cannot make them cease. Why then do you stir them? [Annotation: What method do you employ to move things so?] *Shiwen* notes: *yan* is pronounced *yu-qian*.\n\n\"Stirring them, you produce anomalies. [Annotation: Guo Xiang says: Bestowing favors before things move—such favors do not arise from their prior movement but are anomalous.] The *Qin* edition reads 'responding in advance' instead of 'stirring in advance.' The final *zhe* in the annotation appears as *ye* in the *Northern Song* edition; here, it is corrected according to the *Zang* edition.\" *Shiwen* notes: *xian* is pronounced *xi-jan*.\n\n\"Moreover, there must be stirring, and in shaking, the root of the self. [Annotation: *Shiwen* notes: An alternate version reads 'shaking the root of one’s nature.'] It is also meaningless. [Annotation: If one constantly makes things stir one, then the natures of self and other are set in motion and altered.] Xu Weiyu says: In 'Moreover, there must be stirring,' *bi* ('must') should be *xin* ('heart'), the error arising from graphic similarity. The heart and the root of the self proceed in tandem; if the heart is stirred, it necessarily shakes the root of the self (the root of the self meaning one’s fundamental nature). Thus, the preceding text speaks of externally stabilizing the human heart to □ its affliction. The affliction refers to the heart being moved by things, thereby shaking the root of the self. The *Lie Yukou* chapter of the *Zhuangzi* contains the same error. Wang Chongmin says: *Shen* ('self') has the sense of *xing* ('nature'), for *shen* and *xing* were interchangeable in antiquity. 'Root of the self' is thus equivalent to 'root of one’s nature.' The *Lie Yukou* chapter of the *Zhuangzi* reads 'shaking the root of one’s talent.' *Shiwen* notes: 'An alternate version reads *xing* ('nature') for *cai* ('talent').' Both *cai* characters are errors for *shen*. The *Huainanzi*'s *Yuandao* chapter states, 'Thus one who has attained the Dao does not alter Heaven with man,' with Gao You’s commentary: 'Heavenly nature.' Another gloss says, 'Heavenly self.' 'Heavenly self' is thus equivalent to 'heavenly nature.' The *Sanguozhi*'s commentary on the *Wu Zhi* biography reads: 'The supreme general’s true nature was stout; the central commander-in-chief Zhu Shuo’s nature was lean.' 'Nature stout' and 'nature lean' are thus equivalent to 'self stout' and 'self lean.' The *Zhuangzi* commentary by Guo Xiang says, 'If there must be stirring, then it moves one’s fundamental nature'—this is correct.\" Bo Jun notes: Wang’s interpretation of 'root of the self' as 'root of one’s nature' is correct. However, the *Zhuangzi*’s 'root of one’s talent' is not an error. *Cai* should be read as in the *Mencius*' *Gaozi I*: 'It is not that Heaven has sent down a talent different from yours.' Talent is thus nature.\" *Shiwen* notes: *yi* is pronounced *yi-chi*.\n\n\"Those who wander with you can tell you nothing. [Annotation: They are all followers who shake the root; they cannot enlighten one another.] The annotation originally read 'not all' in Wang’s edition; here, it is corrected according to the *Northern Song* and *Zang* editions.\n\n\"Their petty words are all poison to others. [Annotation: Petty words are subtle and clever, easily stirring others, and thus harmful to them.]\n\n\"None awaken, none comprehend—how can they examine one another?\" [Annotation: They cannot mutually perfect or aid one another.] [Exegesis: What Dao do you employ to stir them?]\n\n\"One must extol words of triumph and ease while expounding strange and extraordinary teachings, flailing one’s tongue to display prowess before all things. Though they may submit to you in droves, what benefit does it bring? Those who dwell with you do not criticize your faults but only praise your strengths—this merely poisons your conduct, inflates your pride, and how can it lead to mutual perfection?\n\n[Variant:] *Mo jue mo wu* appears as *ruo jue ruo wu* in the *Qin* edition.\n[Annotation:] *Gao*, *du*, and *shu* rhyme, all belonging to the ancient *-uk* and *-owk* rhyme groups.\n[Pronunciation note:] *Jue* is pronounced *jiao*.\n\nWhen Yang Zhu journeyed south to Pei, Gu Yanwu remarked: *Liezi* reads 'Yang Zhu south to Pei,' while *Zhuangzi* reads 'Yangzi resided south in Pei'—*Ziju* is a homophone for *Zhu*.\n[Pronunciation note:] *Pei* is pronounced *bei*.\n\nWhen Lao Dan traveled west to Qin, he was intercepted at the outskirts. Upon reaching Liang, he encountered Laozi.\n[Annotation:] *Zhuangzi* refers to *Yangzi Ju*; *Ziju* may have been Yang Zhu’s courtesy name, and he was not contemporaneous with Laozi. These are all allegorical tales.\n\nMidway, Laozi looked up to the sky and sighed:\n[Pronunciation note:] *Zhong dao* means 'midway.' *Yang* was originally written as *ang*, also pronounced *yang*.\n'At first, I thought you could be taught,\n[Pronunciation note:] *Ru* is written as *nü*, pronounced *ru*.\nbut now you cannot be taught.'\n[Annotation:] Though you associate with the perfected, you have not shed your self-importance and boasting, hence it is said you cannot be taught.\n[Pronunciation note:] *Qu* is pronounced *qü*; *kua* is pronounced *kwa*.\n\nYang Zhu did not respond. Upon reaching their lodging, he presented water for washing, rinsing, towels, and a comb.\n[Pronunciation note:] *Guan* is pronounced *guan*; *Zhuangzi* writes it as *guan*. *Shu* is pronounced *shou*. *Zhi* is pronounced *zhi*.\n\nHe removed his shoes outside the door, advanced on his knees, and said: 'Earlier, Master looked up to the sky and sighed, saying,\n[Pronunciation note:] *Xiang* is written as *shang*, pronounced *xiang*.\n\"‘At first, I thought you could be taught, but now you cannot be taught.’ Your disciple wished to ask for an explanation, but as you were traveling without pause,\n[Pronunciation note:] *Jian* is pronounced *xian*, same below.\nI dared not. Now that you have paused, may I inquire as to my fault?'\n\nLaozi said: 'You stare haughtily and gawk arrogantly—\n[Pronunciation note:] *Sui* is pronounced *xuwei*. *Xu* is pronounced *xu*.\n[Citation:] *Shuowen* states: *Xu* means to look upward. *Cangjie Pian* states: *Xu* is the appearance of wide-open eyes. Gao You’s commentary on *Huainanzi* states: *Sui xu* describes the manner of gazing and listening.\nWith whom do you dwell?'\n[Annotation:] How do you conduct yourself and carry on so pompously as to make others sigh at you?\n[Annotation:] *Xu* and *ju* rhyme, both belonging to the ancient *-a* rhyme group in level tone.\n\n'The purest white appears tainted; the greatest virtue seems insufficient.'\n[Annotation:] Without competing with things, one remains humble and restrained.\nMa Qichang notes: *Ru* is a loan for *du*.\n[Annotation:] *Ru* and *zu* rhyme, both belonging to the ancient *-uk* rhyme group in entering tone. Laozi’s forty-first chapter reads 'vast virtue seems insufficient'; Ma Xulun’s *Laozi Hegu* argues that 'greatest' is the correct reading.\n\nYang Zhu’s expression changed, and he said with reverence:\n[Pronunciation note:] *Cu* is pronounced *zilu*.\n'I respectfully receive your instruction.'\n\nWhen he first arrived, the innkeeper and his family came out to greet him. [Annotation:] The host family of the inn. The *Daozang* editions all include the character *zhe* 者 after *she* 舍, except the *Sijie* edition and Wang’s edition, which correctly omit it. Yu Yue notes: *She* 舍 and *she zhe* 舍者 are not the same. Below, it says “the inn guests rose from their mats” and again “the inn guests now vied with him for mats,” both referring to fellow travelers at the inn. Here, *she* 舍 refers to the innkeeper, just as the one who oversees the market is called *shi* 市, and the one who oversees farming is called *tian* 田. The *Liji*’s “Wangzhi” chapter glosses *shi* 市 as “the one who oversees the market,” and its “Yueling” chapter glosses *tian* 田 as “the official in charge of agriculture.” These are analogous examples.\n\nThe master held the mat, and his wife held the comb and mirror. The inn guests rose from their mats, and those warming themselves moved away from the hearth. [Annotation:] When one conceals one’s distinction with excessive modesty, others are daunted by it. Lu Wenchang notes: The character *cang* 藏 in the annotation likely should be *zun* 尊. [Pronunciation note:] *Yang* 炀 is pronounced *yang*. Sima Biao comments: *Yang* 炀 means to face the fire. The *Huainanzi* states: “The rich wear embroidered silks; the poor warm themselves at the hearth’s mouth.”\n\nWhen he returned, the inn guests now vied with him for mats. [Annotation:] When one makes oneself equal to others, others feel no aversion. [Exegesis:] The true recluse makes no boastful claims and bears no air of self-importance. Thus, when Master Yang first arrived, people welcomed and saw him off; but after hearing good counsel and changing his ways, even the inn’s residents now competed with him for mats. The previous chapter spoke of Liezi’s ability to make others protect you, while this chapter shows how Yang Zhu could make others cease protecting you.\n\nWang Chongmin notes: The *Taiping Yulan* (709) includes the character *zao* 灶 before *xi* 席. Comparing this with the earlier phrase “the inn guests rose from their mats, and those warming themselves moved away from the hearth,” it seems the original text likely included *zao* 灶. Wang Shumin notes: The *Taiping Yulan* (709) reads *yang zhe* 炀者 instead of *she zhe* 舍者, and includes *zao* 灶 before *xi* 席. It is likely that the original text had *yang zhe* 炀者 after *she zhe* 舍者 (or before it), and *zao* 灶 before *xi* 席. The phrase “the inn guests and those warming themselves now vied with him for hearth and mats” encompasses both “the inn guests rose from their mats” and “those warming themselves moved away from the hearth.” The *Taiping Yulan*’s version likely omits the two characters *she zhe* 舍者. [Pronunciation note:] *Wu* 恶 is pronounced *wulu*.\n\nYang Zhu passed through Song and stayed at an inn. The innkeeper had two concubines: one beautiful, the other plain. The plain one was honored, while the beautiful one was slighted. Yang Zhu asked the reason. The innkeeper’s young servant replied—[Annotation:] The *Hanfeizi*’s “Shuolin Shang” reads: “The innkeeper’s father answered”—“The beautiful one is beautiful in her own eyes, but I do not see her beauty. The plain one is plain in her own eyes, but I do not see her plainness.”\n\nYang Zi said: \"Disciples, take note! Conduct yourself with worthiness yet discard the conduct of self-regard for worthiness—wherever you go, who would not cherish you?\"\n\n[Annotation:] Arrogance, self-satisfaction, and boasting are what ghosts, spirits, and the human Dao do not favor; emptying the self to follow principle is what the world delights to uphold. Proceeding thus, who could resist you?\n\n[Exegesis:] This further consolidates the meaning of the two preceding sections. Those who can make others preserve regard for me—do those who fail to preserve it do so out of envy? If one does not dare let things preserve regard for oneself, then the world will all forget one’s faults—how much more so the concubines of an inn?\n\n[Annotation by Bo Jun:] The *Hanfeizi*’s “Shuolin Shang” reads: \"Wherever you go, who would not find you beautiful?\"\n\nThere is a Dao of constant victory and a Dao of inconstant victory.\n\n[Tao Hongqing’s note:] \"Inconstant victory\" should read \"constantly not victorious.\" The following text states, \"The Dao of constant victory is softness; the Dao of constantly not being victorious is strength,\" which follows from this.\n\nThese two are also to be known—\n\n[Annotation:] \"Also\" should read \"easy.\"\n\n[Pronunciation note:] *Yi* 亦 is also written *yi* 易, pronounced *yichi*.\n\nYet people have not understood this.\n\nThus the ancients said: \"Strength first concerns those not equal to oneself\"—\n[Annotation:] It refers to those one can overcome who are beneath oneself.\n\"Softness first concerns what proceeds from oneself\"—\n[Annotation:] Without contending with things, nothing can impose upon one.\n\nThose who first concern themselves with what is not equal to themselves will, upon reaching equality, be imperiled—\n[Annotation:] Encountering an equal opponent must be perilous.\nThose who first concern themselves with what proceeds from themselves will know no peril—\n[Annotation:] Their principle remains constantly secure.\n[Pronunciation note:] *Wang* 亡 is read as *wu* 无.\n\nBy this means, one may overcome a single body as if it were nothing, and by this means, one may bear the world as if it were nothing—this is called overcoming without striving to overcome, bearing without striving to bear.\n[Annotation:] To embody the Dao of softness and emptiness, to dwell in a place of non-contention, though it be the nobility of a single body or the vastness of the world, to guide without intention is to be as nothing.\n\nNothing means emptiness and silence.\nGuo Xiang said: \"Listen only to what the ears hear, see only what the eyes see, know only what one knows, and do only what one can do. Employ what is naturally employed, act as one naturally acts, follow one’s nature without contending with things—this is the Dao of utmost softness. Thus, one lifts what lifts itself, holds what holds itself. Though it bears not even the weight of a fraction, I exert no force.\"\n[Exegesis:] Strength and softness—these two are easy to know. Why, then, do people not understand? It is because the desire to prevail is too great. When one encounters those not equal to oneself, it is not yet true strength; if one encounters an equal, one is constantly in danger. Seeking to prevail over a single body or bear the world in this way is ever like servitude, never at ease.\n\nAs for softness, even those beneath oneself are not desired to be overcome—how much less those who proceed from oneself? What others call not overcoming, I call self-overcoming; what others call not bearing, I call self-bearing, and thus there is never failure.\n\nLaozi said: \"The soft and weak overcome the hard and strong.\"\n\nWu Kaisheng said: \"*Ruotu* 若徒 means 'this Dao,' the annotation is mistaken.\"\nZhouzi said: [Pronunciation note:] *Zhou* 粥 is written *yu* 鬻 in the *Shiwen*, which reads: \"鬻 originally written 粥, *yu liu* qie.\"\nRen Dachun said: \"Examining the *Shiwen* of the *Liji* *Quli*, 'please *yu*' is also written *zhou*, *zhi liu* fan; the *Shiwen* of the *Zuozhuan*, 11th year of Duke Yin, 'yu' is also written *zhou*, *zhi liu* fan, and also *yu liu* fan; in the *Xia Xiao Zheng*, 'chicken *fu zhou*,' Lu Bian’s annotation reads, 'some say *zhou* means nourishment'; in the *Huainanzi* *Tianwen Xun*, 'walking *fu yu*,' Gao You’s annotation reads, '*fu yu* is *zhou*'; in the *Wen Xuan* *Pan Yue* *Jianju Fu*, 'irrigating gardens and *zhou* vegetables,' Li Shan’s annotation reads, '*zhou* is the same as *yu*'—thus *yu* and *zhou* are interchangeable.\"\n\n\"To desire hardness, one must guard it with softness;\nTo desire strength, one must preserve it with weakness.\"\n\nGuard softness not to seek hardness, yet hardness arises of itself; preserve weakness not to seek strength, yet strength emerges of its own accord. Thus hardness and strength are not attainable through desire.\n\nYang Bojun notes: *Shou* (守, \"guard\") and *bao* (保, \"preserve\") rhyme, both being rising-tone words of the *you* rhyme group.\n\nAccumulate softness, and hardness will inevitably follow; accumulate weakness, and strength will inevitably arise. Observe what is accumulated, and you will know the direction of fortune and misfortune.\n\n[Annotation:] Fortune and misfortune arise from what is accumulated.\n\nStrength that overcomes what is not equal to oneself will, when it reaches what is equal, become brittle.\n\n[Annotation:] It will surely break.\n\nWu Kaisheng says: *Gang* (刚, \"hardness\") should be written as □, hence the annotation reads \"it will surely break.\"\n\nWang Shumin says: The *Huainanzi*’s *Yuandao Xun* includes the word *zhe* (者, \"that which\") after \"not equal to oneself\" (文子 *Daoyuan* chapter likewise), making the sentence structure consistent with the following text; this should be followed.\n\nSoftness that overcomes what surpasses oneself has a power that cannot be measured.\n\nYang Bojun notes: The words of *Yuezi* cited here also appear in the *Huainanzi*’s *Yuandao Xun* and the *Wenzi*’s *Daoyuan* chapter, though neither attributes them to *Yuezi*. Additionally, *gang* (刚, \"hardness\"), *qiang* (强, \"strength\"), *xiang* (乡, \"direction\"), and *liang* (量, \"measure\") rhyme, all being words of the *yang* rhyme group in ancient pronunciation. The *Huainanzi*’s *Quan Yan Xun* reads: \"Strength that overcomes what is not equal to oneself will, when it reaches what is equal, be obstructed; softness that overcomes what surpasses oneself has a power that cannot be measured,\" rhyming *ge* (格, \"obstructed\") and *du* (度, \"measured\").\n\nLaozi said: \"When weapons are strong, they perish.\n\n[Annotation:] Wang Bi says: That which all things detest cannot endure to the end.\n\nWhen wood is strong, it breaks.\n\n[Annotation:] When strength reaches its extreme, it is destroyed.\n\nYang Bojun notes: The *Daodejing* (Chapter 76) reads: \"When weapons are strong, they are not victorious; when wood is strong, it is felled.\" Yu Yue, Yi Shunding, and Ma Xulun all argue that the *Liezi* version should be followed, as detailed in *Laozi Hegu*.\n\n*Mie* (灭, \"perish\") and *zhe* (折, \"break\") rhyme, both being words of the *zhi* rhyme group in ancient pronunciation.\n\nThe soft and weak are the companions of life; the hard and strong are the companions of death.\"\n\n[Explanation:] The *Junzi* says: \"Those who are overbearing do not meet a natural death; those who love to conquer will surely encounter their match. Accumulating virtue and piling up benevolence is the Way of softness.\"\n\nYang Bojun notes: This also appears in the *Daodejing* (Chapter 76). Additionally, in the Northern Song edition and Wang’s edition, \"companions of death\" (*si zhi tu*, 死之徒) reads \"companions of transformation\" (*hua zhi tu*, 化之徒); here, the reading follows the Zang edition and the Shidetang edition. Furthermore, the *Hanfeizi*’s *Jie Lao* chapter states: \"*Tu* (徒) means *shu* (属, \"to belong\").\" Thus, *tu* here should also be glossed as *shu*.\n\nIn appearance, one need not be childlike, yet wisdom may be childlike; in wisdom, one need not be childlike, yet appearance may be childlike. The sage embraces childlike wisdom and discards childlike appearance, while the common people cling to childlike appearance and distance themselves from childlike wisdom. Those whose appearance resembles mine are near and beloved; those whose appearance differs from mine are distant and feared.\n\n[Annotation:] *Tong* (童, \"childlike\") should be written as *tong* (同, \"same\").\n\nWu Kaisheng says: Taking *tong* (童) as *tong* (同).\n\nThough possessing a seven-foot frame, distinct hands and feet, hair on the head and teeth in the mouth, standing and moving—this is called a human. Yet humans are not necessarily without the hearts of beasts. Even with the hearts of beasts, by appearance they are deemed kin.\n\nWith wings attached and horns borne, fangs spread and claws arrayed, flying aloft or crouching to run—this is called a bird or beast. Yet birds and beasts are not necessarily without the hearts of humans. Even with the hearts of humans, by appearance they are deemed distant.\n\nFuxi,\n\n[Annotation:] *Pao* (庖) is pronounced *pao* (匏); *xi* (牺) is pronounced *xi* (许宜切).\n\nNüwa,\n\n[Annotation:] *Wa* (娲) is pronounced *gua* (瓜).\n\nFuxi and Nüwa were both ancient emperors.\n\nShennong, and the Xia Hou clan had the bodies of serpents and human faces, the heads of oxen and the noses of tigers—these possessed non-human appearances yet held the virtue of great sages.\n\n[Annotation:] Human forms naturally include some resembling birds and beasts; many ancient sages had extraordinary appearances. The so-called \"bodies of serpents and human faces\" does not mean they were scaled and belly-crawling without limbs; \"heads of oxen and noses of tigers\" does not mean they bore horns, had hanging dewlaps, broad foreheads, or loose jaws—just as physiognomy describes \"tortoise backs,\" \"crane strides,\" \"kite shoulders,\" or \"hawk beaks.\"\n\n[Annotation:] *Yi* (臆) is pronounced *yi* (亿); *man* (曼) is pronounced *wan* (万); *e* (頞) is pronounced *e* (乌葛切, \"bridge of the nose\"); *han* (颔) is pronounced *han* (胡感切, \"jaw\"); *xiang* (相) is pronounced *xiang* (息亮切); *hu* (鹄) is pronounced *he* (鹤); *yuan* (鸢) is pronounced *yuan* (缘); *hui* (喙) is pronounced *hui* (许秽切).\n\nJie of Xia, Zhou of Yin, Huan of Lu, and Mu of Chu had the seven apertures of human appearance yet possessed the hearts of birds and beasts. Yet the common people cling to a single appearance in pursuit of supreme wisdom—this is hardly attainable.\n\n[Explanation:] What makes different beings kin is spirit. When spirit departs, even the bond between father and child becomes estranged. Thus, spending a night of terror under the same roof as living creatures brings no fear, for their spirits are the same. Dwelling in an ordinary house with a corpse in the same room induces terror, for their spirits differ. Though the dead and the living share the same form as before, one feels at ease while the other is afraid—this is because those of the same kind have departed, and the form is no longer kin. Yet humans, unaware that all living things share the same spirit despite differing forms, assume worry and fear. To base kinship and distance on the similarity or difference of appearance is delusion. Thus, Zhuangzi says: \"What all things share is spirit; therefore, spirit is the master of nurturing life.\"\n\nYang Bojun notes: Duke Huan of Lu killed his elder brother to seize the throne, and Duke Mu of Chu killed his father to seize the throne—hence they are said to have the conduct of birds and beasts. The *Explanation* cites Zhuangzi, but this passage does not appear in the current text. In the Qin dynasty engraving, \"spending\" (*ju*, 居) is written as \"after\" (*hou*, 后); here, it follows the *Sijie* edition.\n\n[Annotation:] *Ji* (几) is pronounced *ji* (冀).\n\nThe Yellow Emperor and the Flame Emperor battled at the wilds of Banquan,\n\n[Annotation:] *Ban* (阪) is pronounced *ban* (蒲阪切). Banquan is in Shanggu.\n\nleading bears, brown bears, wolves, leopards, lynxes, and tigers as their vanguard.\n\nYang Bojun notes: *Chu* (貙) refers to a large tiger.\n\nThe *Explanation* notes: *Shuai* (帅) is pronounced *shuai* (率). *Pi* (罴) is pronounced *pi* (碑). *Chu* (貙) is pronounced *chu* (丑俱切). Eagles, sparrowhawks, hawks, and kites served as their banners.\n\nWang Shumin notes: The *Yiwen Leiju* (90, 91), *Chuxue Ji* (22), *Taiping Yulan* (919), and *Yu Hai* (83) all include the character \"以\" before \"雕,\" which should be followed. The current text omits \"以,\" leaving the meaning incomplete.\n\nThe *Explanation* notes: *Diaohe* (雕鹖) is pronounced *diaohe* (雕曷), with one version reading *e* (鹗). *Zhi* (帜) is pronounced *chi* (炽). All creatures from bears to brown bears are fierce beasts and valiant fighters.\n\nHu Huaichen notes: The version reading *e* (鹗) is correct. The original text refers to fierce beasts and birds of prey; the sparrowhawk is not a bird of prey and does not belong among them. The reading *e* (鹗) is thus appropriate.\n\nThis is the use of brute force to command beasts. Yao tasked Kui with overseeing music: striking and tapping stones, the hundred beasts danced in unison; when the *Xiao Shao* was played to its ninth movement, the phoenix came to pay homage—this is the use of sound to summon beasts. If so, how do the hearts of beasts differ from those of humans? Their forms and sounds differ from ours, yet we know not the Way of engaging with them.\n\nThe *Explanation* reads: \"而人不知接之之道,\" noting that one version omits the character \"人.\" The sage is all-knowing and all-penetrating, thus able to lead and employ them. The wisdom of beasts includes what comes naturally and what they share with human children. In aligning desires and preserving life, they do not borrow wisdom from humans:\n\nMale and female pair as mates, mother and child share affection; they avoid flatlands and seek high ground, shun cold and pursue warmth;\n\nHu Junyan notes: Hu Huaiche argued that humans do not inherently detest flatlands or favor perilous terrain, thus interpreting \"avoid flatlands and seek high ground\" as referring to defense. In truth, all these phrases take beasts as their subject, with humans outside their scope. Hu’s claim is incorrect.\n\nWhen at rest, they form groups; when moving, they maintain ranks. The *Explanation* reads: \"行, pronounced as *hù gāng*.\" The young stay within, the strong guard without. When drinking, they accompany one another; when feeding, they call to the flock.\n\nIn the Great Antiquity, the *Explanation* reads: \"太 as *dà*, pronounced *tài*,\" they dwelled alongside humans and walked abreast with them. The *Annotation* states: \"Where virtue is pure, beasts harbor no fear.\" In the age of emperors and kings, they first grew startled, scattered, and disordered. By the degenerate era, they concealed themselves and fled, evading harm. The *Annotation* states: \"When humans harbor intent to harm, creatures too know to avoid them.\"\n\nNow, in the land of the Jieshi in the east, the *Explanation* reads: \"介 pronounced *jiè*,\" there are those who frequently comprehend the speech of the six domestic animals. The *Explanation* reads: \"数 pronounced *shuò*; 畜, pronounced *xiù* or *chù*; 解 pronounced *xiè*, as in the annotation.\" This is but a partial attainment of knowledge. The *Annotation* states: \"The tortoise and dragon are the progenitors of creatures with shells and scales; the qilin and phoenix, the sovereigns of those with fur and feathers. Even down to the flying midges and wriggling insects, all call out to one another, each with its own intent and purpose, mutually restraining and guiding—how do they differ from humans? Yet humans, unable to understand, claim that the sounds of beasts lack structure or pattern. Thus, one who exhausts principle and perfects wisdom may penetrate ten thousand paths; one who grasps a single thread through circumstance may chance upon but one avenue.\"\n\nThe *Zuozhuan* of the *Spring and Autumn Annals* states: \"Jie Gelu heard an ox low and said, 'This one will bear four calves, all to be used as sacrificial victims.'\" The annotation \"鸣呼\" in the four *Explanations* edition is mistakenly written as \"鸣呼.\" Lu Wenchang notes: \"In other editions, the character 'four' in the annotation is corrected to 'three' following the *Zuozhuan*.\" Bo Jun observes: \"Both 'four' and 'three' in ancient script are composed of stacked strokes, leading to this error. Here, it should be corrected according to the *Zuozhuan*.\" Examining the end of Lu’s *Explanation*, the edition he consulted also reads \"three.\" Shen Tao, however, emended the *Zuozhuan* based on this text, thereby inverting right and wrong (Shen’s argument is found in *Jiaocuixuan Biji*, juan three). The commentary to the *Shishuo Xinyu*’s \"Words and Conversations\" chapter also cites the *Zuozhuan* as \"This one will bear three calves, all to be used as sacrifices,\" which aligns with the current edition of the *Zuozhuan*, providing further evidence.\n\nThe *Explanation* reads: \"长, pronounced *zhàng*; 蜎, *xuān*; 蠕, *rú*.\"\n\nIn the highest antiquity, the spiritually sagacious possessed complete knowledge of the dispositions of all things and fully understood the sounds of different kinds. They assembled and gathered them, instructing and teaching them, making them equal to the people. Thus, they first convened with ghosts, spirits, *chīmèi*, and demons—the annotation notes: \"This refers to Yu summoning the multitude of spirits at Mount Kuaiji.\" The *Explanation* reads: \"魑, pronounced *chī*; 魅, *mèi*.\" Next, they reached the people of the eight directions, and finally assembled birds, beasts, insects, and moths—the annotation notes: \"This refers to the hundred beasts leading the dance.\" The *Explanation* reads: \"*Erya* states: 'Those with legs are called *chóng* (insects); those without legs are called *é* (moths).' An alternate version reads *chóngyǐ* (insects and ants).\" This shows that the hearts and minds of creatures with blood and *qi* do not differ greatly. The spiritually sagacious, knowing this to be so, left nothing untaught or uninstructed in what they imparted.\n\nThe *Explanation* states: In the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, Jie Gelu heard the lowing of an ox and knew it would produce three sacrificial beasts; Yu’s summoning of the multitude of spirits and Shun’s [dance with] the hundred beasts—these are examples of such affairs. Qin Enfu remarked: \"Lu’s *Explanation* omits the characters *shuàiwǔ* (‘leading the dance’) after ‘hundred beasts.’\" Sun Yirang countered: \"The *Explanation* omits a *wǔ* (‘dance’) after ‘Shun.’ ‘Shun danced with the hundred beasts’ parallels the preceding phrase ‘Yu summoned the multitude of spirits.’ Qin’s claim of an omission of *shuàiwǔ* is incorrect.\"\n\nThere was in Song a certain Master Ju,—the annotation notes: \"One fond of raising gibbons and monkeys, hence called Master Ju.\" The *Explanation* reads: \"*Jū* is pronounced *qīyú*; Master Ju, the gibbon-raising master.\" He loved gibbons, kept them in troops, and could comprehend their intentions;—the *Explanation* reads: \"*Jiě* is pronounced *xiè*.\"—the gibbons, in turn, understood the master’s heart. He diminished his household’s provisions to satisfy the gibbons’ desires. Soon, however, he found himself impoverished and sought to limit their food. Fearing the troop of gibbons would not submit to him,—the annotation notes: \"*Xùn* is pronounced *chún*.\" The *Explanation* reads: \"*Xùn* is pronounced *chún*.\"—he first deceived them, saying: \"I will give you acorns— the annotation notes: \"*Xù*, chestnuts.\" The *Explanation* reads: \"*Xù* is pronounced *yǔ*, oak nuts.\"—three in the morning and four at dusk. Is that enough?\" The troop of gibbons all rose in anger. Presently, he said: \"I will give you acorns, four in the morning and three at dusk. Is that enough?\" The troop of gibbons all prostrated themselves in delight.\n\nAll things that are lured by cunning and baseness are like this. Wu Kaiming remarked: \"*Bǐ* should be read as *fǒu*.\" The *Explanation* reads: \"The phrase *néng bǐ xiāng lǒng* (‘lured by cunning and baseness’) appears in one version as *zhì bǐ xiāng lǒng* (‘lured by intelligence and baseness’).\" Bo Jun noted: \"The version with *zhì* (‘intelligence’) is likely correct, as the following text—‘using intelligence to lure the multitude of fools and the troop of gibbons’—directly follows from this.\" The sage lures the multitude of fools with intelligence, just as Master Ju lured the troop of gibbons with intelligence. Neither name nor reality suffers loss—\"name and reality\" appears in the Northern Song edition as \"if reality,\" and Wang’s edition follows this; here, we follow the *Zang* edition, Qin’s engraved edition, and the *Shidetang* edition in emending it. The *Zhuangzi*’s *Qiwulun* reads: \"name and reality do not suffer loss.\" The *Explanation* reads: \"‘do not’ appears as ‘have not’; it also appears in one version as ‘if reality has not suffered loss.’\"—thereby manipulating their joy and anger.\n\nThe *Explanation* states: Though all sentient beings share in spirit, those with rounded heads and square feet—humans—are the most intelligent. The most intelligent among them become sages and worthies; those of greatest talent become kings and lords. The sage assigns tasks according to ability, each receiving what is fitting. Whether small or great, each fulfills its proper role. Thus, no person is discarded, nor is any thing. Luring them with intelligence—is this limited to the troop of gibbons alone?\n\nThe *Ji Shengzi* reared fighting cocks for King Xuan of Zhou. The *Zangwai* edition reads *Ji Xiaozi*; the Qin edition concurs. Here, we follow the Northern Song edition, the Jifu edition, the *Taiping Yulan* (918), and the *Yiwen Leiju* (91) for correction. The *Zhuangzi*’s *Dasheng* chapter records the same. Bo Jun notes: In the twenty-fifth year of Duke Zhao’s reign in the *Zuozhuan*, the cocks of the Ji and Hou clans fought, where the Ji clan fitted their cock with spurs, and the Hou clan gilded its spurs. The *Lüshi Chunqiu*’s *Qu You* chapter and the *Huainanzi*’s *Renjian Xun* also contain this passage. Cockfighting in antiquity was akin to modern cricket-fighting. The ancient *yuefu* and Tao Qian’s *Returning to Dwell in Gardens and Fields* say, “Cocks crow atop the mulberry trees.” Du Zimei’s *Three Poems from Qiang Village* reads: “The flock of cocks clamors in chaos; guests arrive as the cocks fight. Driving the cocks up the trees, only then do I hear the knocking at the brushwood gate.” In the Tang, cocks could still perch in trees, but today few can. In recent times, cockfighting persists in Guangdong and southern Hunan. The *Explanation* reads *Ji Xiaozi* as *Ji Shengzi*, noting: the surname is Ji, the given name Sheng (or Xiao, pronounced *suǒ jǐng*). *Wei* is pronounced *yú wěi*.\n\nAfter ten days, the king asked, “Are the cocks ready to fight?”\nHe replied, “Not yet. They are still hollowly proud and reliant on their qi.”\n[Annotation] Those without substance who vaunt themselves.\n\nAfter another ten days, the king asked again.\nHe replied, “Not yet. They still respond to shadows and echoes.”\n[Annotation] Their reactions are swift.\nLu Wenchang notes: The annotation “swift” in the *Zangwai* edition reads “rapid.”\nThe *Explanation* reads “swift” as “rapid,” noting: *xiang* is pronounced *xiǎng*. Li Yi says: They answer to cries and turn toward their shadows. *Xun* is pronounced *jùn* or *shēn*; one version reads *su*.\n\nAfter another ten days, the king asked again.\nHe replied, “Not yet.”\n\nStill they stare fiercely and bristle with qi.\n[Annotation] Ever seeking an opponent and insisting on their own victory.\n\nAfter another ten days, the king asked again.\nHe replied, “Nearly so. Though other cocks may crow, this one no longer changes.\n[Annotation] Confronted by an opponent, it does not respond—it has forgotten victory and defeat.\nSeen from afar, it resembles a wooden cock. Its virtue is complete.\n[Annotation] One so perfectly whole no longer resembles creatures of blood and qi.\nNo other cock dares to challenge it; they turn and flee.”\n[Annotation] One whose virtue is complete not only harbors no intent within but also prevents external things from arising in opposition.\n\nGuo Xiang says: To nurture it to completion is to be without rival in the world—how much more so to be complete in oneself?\n\n[Explanation] Relying on qi to vaunt oneself is no sure path to victory. Reacting swiftly to things like an echo or shadow means being turned by them, not yet attaining self-mastery. Fierce stares and bristling qi show the machinations of the mind have not been forgotten. Only by forgetting form and spirit, embracing life and death as one, and remaining unmoved by change can one be without rival among external things.\n\nHui Ang\n[Annotation] Hui Ang was of the same clan as Hui Shi. The *Huainanzi*’s “Dao-ying Xun” writes “Hui Meng” instead; the same below. The *Daozang* annotation reads “grandson of Hui Shi.” Zhang’s commentary on the *Lüshi Chunqiu*’s “Shun Shuo” has “grandson” in error.\n\nPronunciation note: *Ang* is pronounced *ā làng*.\n\nHe was received by King Kang of Song.\n[Collation] The *Lüshi Chunqiu*’s “Shun Shuo” Gao commentary states: “King Kang was the great-grandson of Duke Zhao of Song, son of Duke Pi, named Qin. He reigned eleven years, usurped the title of king, and after forty-five years of great impropriety was called ‘the Song ruler unworthy of benevolence and righteousness.’ King Min of Qi conquered and destroyed him.”\nBi Yuan says: Liang Bozi notes that the annotation “named Qin” should read “Yan.” The “forty-five years” differs from the *Jin Se* commentary’s “forty-seven years,” but in fact it was sixty-one years.\n\nPronunciation note: *See* is pronounced *xiàn*.\n\nThe king stamped his foot and cleared his throat.\nWu Kaisheng says: *Die* should be read as *die* (to stumble).\n[Collation] Many Six Dynasties texts mention “stamping the foot,” with varying interpretations. The *Liangshu*’s biography of Crown Prince Zhaoming reads: “The steed stamps its foot with a mournful whinny, the hearse moves slowly with a sorrowful clatter”—here “stamping the foot” means a slow pace. Yan Yanzhi’s *Red and White Horse Rhapsody* reads: “Gazing west with head held high, toward northern clouds it stamps its foot”—here “stamping the foot” means swift movement.\n\nPronunciation notes: *Die* is pronounced *dié*; *qing* is pronounced *qǐng*.\n\n\"Kai\" is pronounced *kǎi*.\n\nThe king spoke hastily: \"What I, the solitary one, delight in—*shuo* is pronounced *yuè* (delight), same below—is courage and strength, not delighting in benevolence and righteousness. What instruction do you have for me?\"\n\nHui Ang replied: \"I possess a Dao here that renders a man, though brave, unable to pierce;—*ci* (pierce) is pronounced *qì*—though strong, unable to strike.—*zhong* (strike) is pronounced *zhòng*, same below. Does Your Majesty not wish to hear it?\"\n\nThe King of Song said: \"Excellent; this is what I desire to hear.\"\n\nHui Ang said: \"Though one cannot pierce and cannot strike, this is still a disgrace. I possess a Dao here that makes a man, though brave, dare not pierce; though strong, dare not strike. That he dares not—is not because he lacks the will. I possess a Dao here that eliminates the will itself. That there is no such will—*Daozang* white-text edition and Lin Xiyi’s edition both read *zhe* (者) for *ye* (也)—is because there is no mind of love and benefit. I possess a Dao here that makes all men and women under heaven joyfully desire to love and benefit one another.—*Huan* (joyfully) is pronounced *huān*. This surpasses courage and strength, standing above the four layers.\"\n\n[Annotation] It stands above the ranks of ministers, grandees, officers, and commoners, hence \"four layers.\" Guang Congxie says: \"The four layers: the first is being unable to pierce or strike; the second, daring not to pierce or strike; the third, having no will to strike; the fourth, making all under heaven desire to benefit one another.\" Hu Huaichen’s explanation is the same. Tao Hongqing says: \"This passage should read the thirteen characters *this surpasses courage and strength, standing above the four layers* as a single phrase. The four layers refer collectively to the four matters above: courage and strength (first); being unable to pierce or strike (second); daring not to pierce or strike (third); and having no will to strike (fourth). What is now spoken of—having no such will and yet possessing a mind of love and benefit—thus stands above the four layers. *Lei* (layers) means cumulative levels, like four tiers above.\" The *Huainanzi*’s *Daoying Xun* quotes this passage, with Gao You’s commentary: \"These four matters are all burdens upon the world, while making men and women joyfully desire to benefit one another is above them\"—though the meaning remains unclear. Wu Kaisheng says: \"The 'four layers' refer to the four matters above; the annotation is mistaken.\"\n\nThe King of Song said: \"This is what I desire to obtain.\"\n\n[Explanation] Unable to pierce or strike (first); not daring to pierce or strike (second); having no will to strike (third); making men and women joyfully love and benefit one another (fourth). Of these four tiers, to attain the highest—how would that be? Thus the King of Song eagerly desired to hear it.\n\nHui Ang replied: \"Confucius and Mozi are such.\"\n\nHere the elucidation shows that employing wisdom to harmonize all things and exalting instruction to transform people are but secondary affairs for those who ascend through virtue. Confucius and Mozi, though without land, became rulers; *Shiwen* notes: “翟 is read as *Di*.” Mo Di, a grandee of Song who lived after Confucius, composed seventy-one chapters advocating filial piety, reverence for spirits, strengthening the root and moderating expenditure—also a remedy for the world’s ills; he possessed arts of attack and defense. Though without office, they became leaders; the Qin edition reads “office” as “palace.” *Shiwen* notes: “长 is read as *zhǎng*.” Not a man or woman under Heaven failed to crane their necks and stand on tiptoe, yearning to dwell in peace and benefit under them.\n\nNow Your Majesty is lord of ten thousand chariots; the *Lüshi Chunqiu* reads “ten thousand chariots” as “one thousand chariots.” If you truly hold such aspiration, then within the four borders— the Qin edition reads “竟” as “境.” *Shiwen* notes: “竟 is read as *jìng*.”—all would receive its benefit. Your worth would far surpass that of Confucius and Mozi.\n\nThe King of Song had no reply. Hui Ang hastened out. The King of Song said to his attendants: “How persuasive! The guest has convinced me with his argument!” Here the elucidation shows that exalting the Dao to illumine virtue and leaving traces to benefit people—while the multitude of disciples see only the transmission of Confucius and Mozi’s teachings, how would they know the hidden Dao that manifests virtue? Thus the inquiry into the ford does not herd with birds and beasts; this is its great purport.\n\n*Bo Jun’s note*: The elucidation’s “inquiry into the ford does not herd with birds and beasts” alludes to the *Analects’* *Weizi* chapter, where Zilu is sent to ask about the ford, and the Master, dismayed, says one cannot herd with birds and beasts—but this does not accord with the original meaning of the *Analects*. *Shiwen* notes: “说 is read as *shuō*, or alternatively as *shuì*.” “Convince the King” in one edition reads “enlighten the King.” *Liezi Jishi*, Scroll Three, *King Mu of Zhou*, Third.\n\nThe *Annotation* states: That which receives existence and is called \"form\" is born; that which bends and rises in ceaseless alteration is called \"transformation.\" Where the spirit intermingles is called \"dream\"; where form engages is called \"waking.\" Tracing them to their utmost, they converge in emptiness and artifice. Why? The substance of life is rooted in stagnation, enduring a hundred years before its end; the passions of transformation branch shallowly, vanishing in the blink of an eye. The Dao of spirit is dim and indistinct, now present, now absent; the principles of form are manifest and evident, now real, now solid. Thus one who perceives deeply knows the principle of arising and ceasing is equal, the paths of waking and dreaming are one; though ten thousand changes unfold in profusion, they do not touch the spirit’s contemplation. The deluded, confounding the manifest and the obscure, take the slowness or swiftness of verification as cause for doubt, and so cling to the self, regarding the bodily frame as their true dwelling. Who recognizes that the root and return of life and transformation lie in nothingness?\n\nThe *Elucidation* states: Heaven and earth form vessels, encompassing all things. Human beings live within them, yet only preserve their existence; they never realize that spirit governs form, and the insubstantial is not constrained by the substantial. This is why the sage nurtures the root, while the foolish know only to nurture the branch. They constrict form to sustain life, coveting life yet unaware of life’s master; they take the decay of form as death, unaware that spirit and consciousness endure forever. The deluded remain ordinary, while the enlightened attain sagely wisdom. The confused are many, so the text first speaks of the enlightened to clarify the distinction.\n\nWang Lai notes: In the *Elucidation*, \"the insubstantial is not constrained by the substantial\" should read \"the substantial is constrained by the insubstantial.\" Qin Enfu notes: In the *Elucidation*, the character \"branch\" is missing before \"constricts form.\" Bo Jun’s note: In the *Annotation*, after \"one who perceives deeply,\" the character \"者\" should be added. The *Shiwen* reads \"blink of an eye\" as \"blink of an eye,\" and \"dim and indistinct\" as \"elusive and indistinct,\" and notes: *俛* is pronounced *miǎn*. *觉* is pronounced *jiào*. *怳* is pronounced *huǎng*. *惚* is pronounced *hū*. Regarding the time of King Mu of Zhou, the *Shiwen* states: King Mu of Zhou was named Man, son of King Zhao.\n\nIn the kingdom of the Western Extremity, there came a *huaren*—a being of transformation and illusion. Bo Jun’s note: The *Shu Chao* (Vol. 129), *Tai Ping Yu Lan* (Vols. 173, 626) quote \"Western Extremity\" as \"Western Regions.\" The *Yi Wen Lei Ju* (Vol. 62) quotes it as \"Western Hu.\" The *Shiwen* notes: *幻* is pronounced *huàn*. They entered water and fire, pierced metal and stone; they reversed mountains and rivers, relocated cities and towns. Riding the void, they did not fall; encountering the solid, they met no obstruction. Their thousand changes and ten thousand transformations could not be exhausted. Having already altered the forms of things, they further transformed people’s thoughts—temporarily causing them to forget their long-held knowledge and perceptions. King Mu revered them as spirits and served them as lords.\n\nThe *Elucidation* states: The concerns of ordinary people extend no further than cravings and aversions, fame and profit, benevolence and righteousness. The *huaren* now returns them to their true nature, hence it is called \"transformation.\" The *huaren* is a body responsive to all things. Exhausting principle and perfecting wisdom, their responses are boundless; their thousand changes and ten thousand transformations have no end. King Mu offered them a secluded chamber to reside in, presented the three sacrificial animals, and selected female musicians to entertain them. The *huaren* deemed the king’s palace crude and unfit for dwelling, his kitchen fare rank and foul and inedible—Hu Huaichen notes: \"蝼\" should be \"偻,\" with the characters \"偻\" and \"膻\" transposed. It should read: \"The king’s palace was crude and unfit for dwelling, his kitchen fare rank and foul and inedible, his consorts and attendants deformed and repulsive and unlovable.\" The *Shiwen* notes: *腥* is pronounced *xīng*. *蝼* is pronounced *lóu*. *飨* is pronounced *xiǎng*. The *Zhou Li*, \"Offices of Heaven,\" \"Nei Yong\" states: \"That which is rank and inedible: horses with black spines and patterned forelegs, and *lóugū*.\" Zheng Xuan comments: \"Patterned forelegs refer to fur with natural markings. *Lóugū* is the stench of mole crickets.\" Modern readers should follow the *Zhou Li*’s *Yong Shi*. *饔* is pronounced *yōng*. *般* is pronounced *bān*. Bo Jun’s note: The current edition of the *Fang Yan* still reads \"蝼蛄,\" not with the \"女\" radical. The king’s consorts and attendants were rank and repulsive and unlovable.\n\nThe *Elucidation* states: To deem the king’s palace crude, his kitchen fare rank, and his consorts and attendants foul is to show that the *huaren* does not value sensory pleasures, flavors, or dwellings. Yu Yue notes: *膻* should be *膻*, meaning foul and unlovable. The *Guang Ya*, \"Explanation of Utensils,\" states: \"膻 means foul.\" The *Shiwen* notes: *膻* is pronounced *shān*. King Mu then had it rebuilt for them. Wang Shu Min notes: The *Rong Zhai Si Bi* (Vol. 3) includes the characters \"palace chambers\" after \"built.\" The labor of earth and timber, the *Shiwen* notes: *乃* is written as *乃*, an ancient form of *乃*. *为* is pronounced *wěi*. The colors of ochre and whitewash, the *Shiwen* notes: *赭* is pronounced *zhě*, red. *垩* is pronounced *è*, white earth. No craftsmanship was spared. The five treasuries were emptied, and the terrace was finally completed. A thousand *ren* in height, it overlooked the summit of Mount Zhongnan—the *Shiwen* notes: Zhongnan is a mountain name in Jingzhao—and was named the Terrace of Central Heaven. He selected from among the graceful and supple maidens of Zheng and Wei, those of delicate beauty and lithe elegance—the *Annotation* states: *娥媌* means bewitching beauty; *靡曼* means soft and delicate. The *Shiwen* notes: *媌* is pronounced *máo*. Those lovely and light are called *娥*; east of the Pass, in the regions of He and Qi, they are called *媌*, or sometimes *妖*. *曼* is pronounced *wàn*.\n\nThey applied fragrant unguents and perfected their moth-like brows—*\"e\"* in most editions appears as *\"é\"* (moth). Wang Chongmin notes: the Jifu edition writes *\"é\"* as *\"e\"* (beauty). *\"E\"* is the proper character, while *\"é\"* is the vulgar form. *Fangyan* states: *\"e\"* means \"beautiful\"; in the regions of Qin and Jin, those lovely and light are called *\"e.\"* This is the original sense of *\"e-mei\"* (moth-brows). The notion that it resembles the brows of silkworm moths began with Yan Shigu’s *Hanshu* commentary, which, misreading the *Shi Jing*’s *Wei Feng* *\"Shi Ren\"* (\"The Stately Lady\")—where *\"qin\"* (dragonfly) and *\"e\"* (moth) stand in parallel—mistook *\"qin\"* for *\"qingqing\"* (a kind of insect) and thus took *\"e\"* to mean silkworm moths, unaware that *\"qin\"* should be *□* and *\"e\"* should be *\"e\"* (beauty). The *Chu Ci*’s *Da Zhao* reads: *\"E-mei, lithe and graceful.\"* Mei Cheng’s *Qi Fa* has: *\"Radiant teeth, moth-like brows.\"* Zhang Heng’s *Si Xuan Fu* writes: *\"Delicate eyes, moth-like brows.\"* All use *\"e.\"* Bo Jun notes: Wang’s argument follows Chen Huan’s *Mao Shi Zhuan Shu*, and is correct. Here we follow the Jifu edition. *Shiwen* notes: *\"e\"* is pronounced *é*. They adorned themselves with hairpins and earrings—the *Annotation* states: *ji* are hair ornaments; *er* are *tian* (earplugs). *Shiwen* notes: *ji* is pronounced *jī*; *er* is pronounced *ěr*; *tian* are jade pendants hanging from the crown to fill the ears. *Tian* is pronounced *tiàn* (with the initial *t* as in *tian*). They wore robes of fine *a*-silk and *xi*-cloth—the *Annotation* states: *a* is fine *hu* (gauze); *xi* is fine linen. Hu Huaichen notes: *xi* is interchangeable with *xi* (fine hemp). *A* refers to Dong’e County in Qi, as cited in Xu Guang’s commentary to the *Li Si Zhuan*. *A-xi* stands in parallel with *Qi-wan* (Qi silk). *A* here clearly refers to Dong’e; Zhang’s annotation is incorrect. *Shiwen* notes: *yi* (to wear) is pronounced *yì*; *hu* is pronounced *hú*. They trailed skirts of Qi silk—the *Annotation* states: Qi is the name of the region where *wan* (silk) is produced. *Shiwen* notes: *ye* (to trail) is pronounced *yì*. *Qi-wan*: Fan Zi states, *\"White silk and plain silk come from Qi and Lu.\"* They powdered their faces white and darkened their brows with *dai*. *Shiwen* notes: *dai* is pronounced *dài*. They wore jade pendants and rings, and adorned themselves with mixed *zhi* and *ruo*—the *Annotation* states: *zhi* and *ruo* are fragrant herbs. *Shiwen* notes: *zhi* is pronounced *zhǐ*. They filled the halls to overflowing, and performed *Cheng Yun*, *Liu Ying*, *Jiu Shao*, and *Chen Lu* to entertain them—the *Annotation* states: *Cheng Yun* is the music of the Yellow Emperor; *Liu Ying*, the music of Emperor Ku; *Jiu Shao*, the music of Shun; *Chen Lu*, the music of Tang. *Shiwen* writes *\"Jiu Shao\"* as *\"Jiu Zhao\"*, and notes: *ying* is pronounced *yìng* (with the initial *w* as in *wù*), or *jīng*; *zhao* was originally *shao*, pronounced *shào*. Ren Dachun notes: The *Li Sao* reads, *\"They played the* Jiu Ge *and danced the* Shao*,\"* with a supplementary note: *\"The* Shan Hai Jing *states that Xia Hou Kai began the song* Jiu Zhao. *\" Kai is the same as Qi. The* Bamboo Annals *reads, *\"Xia Hou Qi danced the* Jiu Shao*,\"* showing that* zhao *and* shao *were often used interchangeably in antiquity. Every month they presented jade robes, and every morning they offered jade delicacies—the *Annotation* states: This speaks of their rare treasures. *\"Month-month\"* in the Shide Tang edition appears as *\"sun-moon,\"* which is incorrect. Even the *hua-ren* (transformed beings) could not bear to leave, and only with reluctance did he ascend the terrace. *Shiwen* notes: *she* is pronounced *shì*.\n\n**[Exegesis]**\nThe king failed to grasp its meaning and instead embellished it further. Even the transformed being remained unsettled, for his true heart lay not in this. Qin Enfu notes: The exegesis contains a superfluous \"之\" character.\n\nAfter but a short while—*Shiwen* notes: *wáng* is pronounced *wú*; *jǐ* is pronounced *jū qǐ*—he requested the king to journey together. *Shiwen* notes: *yè* means \"to request.\" The king grasped the transformed being’s sleeve—*Annotation*: *qū* refers to the sleeve of a garment. *Shiwen* notes: *qū* is pronounced *qū*—and soared upward until they halted mid-heaven. *Shiwen* notes: *shàng* is pronounced *shí zhǎng*.\n\nThey arrived at the transformed being’s palace. Wang Chongmin observes: \"暨\" and \"及\" share the same meaning; their pairing here is redundant, likely due to a later hand appending \"及\" beneath \"暨\" as a gloss, which was then mistakenly incorporated into the main text. The *Leiju* (62), *Chuxue Ji* (27), and *Yulan* (812) all omit the character \"及.\" Wang Shumin adds: The *Beishan Lu* (1, \"Shengren Sheng\" chapter), *Wen Xuan* commentary on Zuo Taichong’s *Wei Du Fu*, and *Yulan* (173) likewise omit \"及.\" *Shiwen* notes: *jì* is pronounced *qí qì*.\n\nThe transformed being’s palace was constructed of gold and silver, adorned with pearls and jade. It rose above the clouds and rain, its foundations unseen below. Wang Shumin notes: The *Beishan Lu* (1, \"Shengren Sheng\" chapter) includes the character \"所\" before \"据,\" rendering the phrasing more complete; this should be followed. From afar, it appeared like a mass of clouds. All that met the eyes and ears, all that entered the nose and mouth, was unlike anything found in the human realm.\n\nKing Mu believed this to be the Qingdu, Ziwei, Juntian, and Guangyue—realms where the Thearch dwells.\n\n**[Annotation]** Qingdu and Ziwei are the abodes of the Heavenly Thearch. *Records* state: \"When Duke Mu of Qin fell ill and lost consciousness, upon awakening he said: 'I was in the Thearch’s realm, greatly joyed, roaming with the hundred spirits in the Juntian’s vast music. Nine performances and myriad dances—unlike the music of the Three Dynasties, its sounds stirred the heart.'\" Another account claims Viscount Jian of Zhao experienced the same.\n\n**[Bo Jun’s note]** The annotation’s content appears in the *Records of the Grand Historian*, *Biographies of Bian Que and Cang Gong*.\n\n**[Shiwen]** \"Mu\" is written as \"Miao.\" \"Guangyue\" (*yue*) is pronounced *yuè*; the annotation concurs. \"Shenle\" (*le*) is pronounced *luò*. \"Miao\" is pronounced *mù*.\n\nThe king lowered his gaze and saw palaces and pavilions stacked like clods of earth and heaps of brushwood.\n\n**[Shiwen]** \"Kuai\" is pronounced *kòu duì*. \"Su\" refers to firewood gatherers.\n\n**[Bo Jun’s note]** The *Shiwen*’s \"人\" is likely a scribal error for \"也.\" The *Shide Tang* edition emends it to \"也.\"\n\nThe king, having dwelled there for decades, no longer longed for his own kingdom.\n\n**[Annotation]** This is what is meant by \"altering one’s concerns.\"\n\n**[Exegesis]** The Central Heaven embodies the most numinous of hearts. As King Mu could not instantly forsake his desires, the transformation was wrought through the splendor of palaces, seizing his most cherished attachments.\n\nThe transformed being again invited the king to roam together.\n\n**[Shiwen]** \"Fu\" is pronounced *fú yòu*.\n\nWherever they went,\n\n**[Shiwen]** \"Chu\" is pronounced *chǎng jù*.\n\nAbove, he saw neither sun nor moon; below, neither rivers nor seas. Wherever light and radiance shone,\n\n**[Wang Shumin’s note]** The *Beishan Lu* (1, \"Shengren Sheng\" chapter) writes \"彩\" for \"影.\"\n\nThe king’s eyes blurred, unable to see clearly.\n\n**[Shiwen]** \"Xuan\" is pronounced *xuán*.\n\nWherever sounds arose, the king’s ears were confounded, unable to hear distinctly. His hundred bones and six viscera quivered, unsettled.\n\n**[Shiwen]** \"Ji\" is pronounced *qí jì*.\n\nHis mind wandered, his essence scattered.\n\n**[Shiwen]** \"Sang\" is pronounced *xī làng*.\n\nHe begged the transformed being to let him return.\n\n**[Annotation]** The realm of the Great Void’s indistinctness is not a place mortals can traverse. Confusion of heart and eyes is the natural consequence.\n\nThe transformed being moved him,\n\n**[Annotation]** \"Moved\" means \"pushed.\"\n\nAnd the king fell as if into the void.\n\n**[Annotation]** \"Yun\" means \"to plummet.\"\n\n**[Exegesis]** The ultimate principle is the very place the transformed being reached. All phenomena are utterly exhausted—how could sun, moon, rivers, or seas remain? All delusions are dispelled—how could light or shadows persist? This is a state the vulgar form cannot endure, nor the ordinary heart ever know. Yet clinging to the past lingered, so he begged to return.\n\n**[Note]** \"殒\" in all editions is also written as \"\". **Wang Lai’s note:** The exegesis omits \"音响\" before \"光景.\"\n\n**[Shiwen]** \"殒\" is written as \"\", pronounced *yǔn*, meaning \"to fall.\"\n\nUpon awakening, he found himself seated where he had been before,\n\n**[Shiwen]** \"Xiang\" is pronounced *xiàng*.\n\nAnd his attendants were the same as before. Looking ahead, the wine had not yet cleared, nor the dishes spoiled.\n\n**[Annotation]** Pronounced *fú guì*.\n\n**[Shiwen]** \"Fei\" is pronounced *fú guì*.\n\nThe local dialect explains: \"昲\" means \"to dry things.\" It is also pronounced *fèi*.\n\nThe king asked where he had come from. His attendants replied, \"The king has been in silent meditation.\" From this, King Mu was lost in self-absorption for three months before recovering.\n\n**[Shiwen]** The phrase reads, \"for three months before recovering,\" with one variant reading \"did not recover.\"\n\nHe further inquired about the *Huaren*.\n\n**[Annotation]** He asked about the meaning of the form remaining unmoved.\n\n**[Exegesis]** Free from the cares of clinging, he entered the method of tranquil illumination. In a single thought, he surpassed what ten thousand generations could not attain. How could the realm of the perfected person require another method? Thus, the wine had not yet cleared, nor the dishes dried. His attendants saw the king sitting in silence, with no coming or going, and so for three months, the king sat in forgetfulness, not daring to ask.\n\n**Qin Enfu’s note:** The character \"聖\" (*shèng*) in the exegesis is an error, possibly a superfluous addition.\n\n**Bo Jun’s note:** In the exegesis, the phrase \"肴未昲\" (*yáo wèi fèi*)—in the Qin edition, \"未\" (*wèi*) was written as \"夫\" (*fū*)—has been corrected here according to the *Sijie* edition.\n\nThe *Huaren* said, \"I traveled in spirit with Your Majesty—how could the form have moved?\n\n**[Annotation]** That which is called \"spirit\" moves without haste yet arrives swiftly, goes without walking yet reaches its destination. To illustrate with a common example: in a single night’s slumber, one may dream of a hundred years’ events or see things from the farthest realms. While awake, in the brief span of a bow and a stretch, one may touch what lies beyond the six directions. If even wayward thoughts and wanton fancies can achieve this, how much more so when the spirit moves alone, unconfined by form or vessel, perfectly penetrating and mysteriously illuminating, serene and concentrated in emptiness?\"\n\n**[Shiwen]** \"覺\" is pronounced *jiào*.\n\n\"Moreover, the place where I dwelt before—how is it different from Your Majesty’s palace? The places where I wandered before—how are they different from Your Majesty’s gardens? What you are accustomed to remains, and you doubt only its temporary absence.\n\n**[Annotation]** Both that and this are not true things. To grow accustomed to what is always present and doubt its momentary absence—this is the delusion of the heart.\"\n\n**Qin edition:** \"王閒恒疑攓亡\" (*Wáng xián héng yí qiān wáng*). In other editions, the character \"有\" (*yǒu*) is omitted after \"恒\" (*héng*). Here, it has been added following the *Shidetang* edition.\n\n\"閒\" (*xián*) means \"to be accustomed.\" \"恒有\" (*héng yǒu*) corresponds to the annotation’s \"常存\" (*cháng cún*, \"always present\"). \"閒恒有\" (*xián héng yǒu*) and \"疑暫亡\" (*yí zàn wáng*) form a parallel structure.\n\n**[Shiwen]** \"閒\" is pronounced *xián*, meaning \"to be accustomed to what is always present.\" One variant omits the character \"有\" (*yǒu*).\n\n\"At the extreme of transformation, in the space between slow and swift, can it be fully grasped?\"\n\n**[Annotation]** Transformation cannot be exhausted, and the principle of slow and swift admits no gap. To seek its image or model with the intellect is beyond measure.\n\n**[Exegesis]** The marvel of the spirit’s distinction from form is thus further clarified. The king, accustomed only to what he habitually saw, doubted its temporary absence. But for the person of the utmost Dao, who constantly forgets their form, what doubt could there be? The spirit’s transformations, whether slow or swift, cannot be fully expressed.\n\n**[Shiwen]** \"模\" is written as \"摸\" (*mō*), pronounced *mó*.\n\nThe king was overjoyed. He neglected state affairs,\n\n**[Shiwen]** \"恤\" is pronounced *xù*.\n\nTook no delight in his ministers or concubines,\n\n**[Annotation]** Moved by these profound words, he abandoned the governance of worldly affairs and forgot the hierarchy between ruler and subject.\n\n**[Shiwen]** \"治\" is pronounced *zhì*.\n\nAnd indulged in distant wanderings.\n\n**[Exegesis]** In Zhuangzi’s discourse, those who value the Dao abandon the world without a backward glance—what concern have they for it? Thus, it is like treating dust, chaff, or husks as the clay from which Yao and Shun were molded. Who would take such things as matters of importance? Moreover, to be drowned in the allure of sounds, colors, and desires—how could this be the way of one who delights in the Dao? The king’s joy in the Dao led him to neglect state affairs and take no pleasure in his ministers or concubines. His \"distant wanderings\" meant forgetting what was near and familiar.\n\n**In the exegesis, \"陶鑄\" (*táo zhù*) was originally written as \"陶懤\" (*táo chóu*), but has been corrected here according to the *Sijie* edition.**\n\nHe ordered the harnessing of the eight steeds:\n\n**[Shiwen]** \"駿\" is pronounced *jùn*. \"乘\" is pronounced *shèng*, and the same applies below.\n\nThe right-hand trace horse was □\n\n**[Annotation]** The ancient character for \"驊\" (*huá*).\n\n**Lü** (*liú*), and the left-hand trace horse was **Lü’er** (*Lǜ ěr*). In the *Shidetang* edition, \"□\" is written as \"□\".\n\n**Sun Yirang’s note:** □ is the seal-script form of \"騧\" (*guā*) from the *Shuowen*’s \"Horse\" section. Here, □ has been altered to □, and □ to □, with the left and right reversed, rendering it unrecognizable (originally from Zhang Wenhu’s *Shu Jutang Suibi*). The *Mu Tianzi Zhuan* writes it as □, which is also incorrect.\n\n**[Shiwen]** \"□\" is pronounced *huá*. \"騮\" is pronounced *liú*. □騮 (*Huáliú*) and 綠耳 (*Lǜ ěr*) are two of the eight steeds.\n\n**Ren Dachun’s note:** The *Mu Tianzi Zhuan* states, \"The right-hand trace horse was □騮,\" with a note reading, \"Possibly the character for 驊騮 (*huáliú*).\" The characters □ and □ are graphically similar and can be mutually verified.\n\nThe right-hand side horse was **Chiji** (*Chì jì*), and the left-hand side horse was **Bai□** (*Bái □*).\n\n**[Annotation]** The ancient character for \"義\" (*yì*). In the *Shidetang* edition, \"義\" is written as \"牺\" (*xī*).\n\n**Hong Yi’s note:** The *Erya*’s \"Explanation of Livestock\" states, \"A horse with a whorl of hair on the elbow is called *déjiǎn yáng*.\" □ is the character for \"減\" (*jiǎn*). The *Mu Tianzi Zhuan* writes it as \"左白儀\" (*zuǒ bái yí*), with Guo Pu’s note reading, \"The ancient character for *yì*.\" Thus, the annotation explains □ as *xī*, which is a corruption of the character *yí*. □ is not the character *xī*.\n\n**Sun Yirang’s note:** \"白□\" appears twice in the *Mu Tianzi Zhuan*, once written as *yì* and once as *yí*. Guo Pu also states, \"The ancient character for *yì*,\" which matches Zhang’s annotation. The *Guangya*’s \"Explanation of Livestock\" lists a horse type called *lù*, possibly a loan for this character. The current text writes it as □. While Hong Yi suggests it corresponds to the *Erya*’s *déjiǎn yáng*, the forms are somewhat similar, but this reading does not align with the *Mu Tianzi Zhuan* or Zhang and Guo’s pronunciations, and may not be accurate.\n\n**[Shiwen]** \"□\" is written as \"牺\" (*xī*), pronounced *yì*. \"驂\" is pronounced *cān*. \"驥\" is pronounced *jì*.\n\nThe *Records of the Grand Historian* states: \"Zaofu obtained for King Mu the horses *Huáliú*, *Lǜ ěr*, *Chì jì*, and *Bái xī*, with which he drove on his travels, visiting the Queen Mother of the West and delighting in her company until he forgot to return.\" This account is largely consistent with the *Mu Tianzi Zhuan*.\n\nGuo Pu’s annotation states, \"All are named after their coat colors.\" Later, there are *Qúhuáng*, *Yúlún*, *Dàolí*, and *Shānzǐ*, making the Eight Steeds. For the main chariot, Zaofu served as charioteer, and □□ as the right-hand attendant.\n\n**[Annotation]** \"The upper part resembles *qí* (齊), and the lower part resembles *hé* (合); this is an ancient character, but its exact form remains uncertain.\"\nSun Yirang notes: \"The *Shiwen* writes '□' as '□', stating: '□ is pronounced *tài*, and its seal script form is □.' □ should be written as □, with the upper part resembling *dà* (大) and □, akin to the upper half of *qí* (齊); the lower part, derived from *shuǐ* (水), has become *hé* (合), which is a considerable deviation. Yin Yun’s seal script form □ is also a scribal error. The original Zhang annotation likely matched the *Shiwen*, hence the note 'the upper part resembles *qí*, and the lower part resembles *hé*.' This annotation should originally have been placed under '□,' indicating that the character’s upper part resembles *qí* (in fact, following the *Shiwen*, it is an abbreviated form of *qí*), and the lower part resembles *hé*. Since no ancient character dictionary records this form, and neither its shape nor sound can be explained, it is labeled 'uncertain.' Though Zhang and Yin’s versions erroneously wrote □ as □, the pronunciation *tài* remained correct. The phrase 'the upper part resembles *qí*, and the lower part resembles *hé*' specifically describes the form of □ and is unrelated to its pronunciation, much less to the character □. In other versions, □ was further corrupted into □ (the upper *qí* became □, and the lower *hé* became *jiǒng*), losing its resemblance to *qí* and *hé*, while this annotation was mistakenly moved beneath the character □. Readers, unfamiliar with the original text, could not decipher it and thus split the annotation—originally describing the form of □—into the pronunciations of □ and □. This error was adopted from a variant cited in the *Shiwen* (Yin’s version had not yet corrupted the character □, so it is unlikely there was no correction; perhaps this entry in the *Shiwen* was interpolated by Chen Jingyuan?). Later, Ding Du’s *Jiyun* and Han Daozhao’s *Wuyin Jiyun* followed this interpretation, including □ under the *qí* initial and □ under the *hé* initial—a case of ancient texts being repeatedly miscopied and losing their original form to such an extent.\n\n**[The *Yupian* under the *gōng* (弓) section includes the character □, stating: \"Pronounced *húhé* (胡合切), meaning 'to meet.' This is also a corruption of □. This entry was certainly not part of Gu Yewang’s original work but was recklessly added by later Song scholars.]**\n\nThe *Shiwen* cites the Stone Classics as writing '□' as '□' (based on the Wei *Three-Script Stone Classics*; this is the ancient form of the character *bǐng* (丙). Neither Guo Zhongshu’s *Hanjian* nor Hong’s *Lixu* includes this character among the surviving fragments of the Stone Classics, and it cannot be verified today). This also does not form a recognizable character. Speculatively, the ancient script in the Stone Classics likely originally wrote it as □ (Ruan Yuan’s *Jigu Zhai Zhongding Kuanshi* records the *Zhōu Hū dǐng*, where the character □ is written as □, and *bǐng* (丙) is written in this form. The *Stone Drums*’ *Yǐ gǔ* simplifies the character □ by omitting □, making its form even more complete). This likely represents a reduplicated form of *bǐng* (古籀文 often employs reduplication, as in *wǔ* (五) written as □, *bèi* (贝) as □, and *chē* (车) as □). In clerical script, it should be written as □, but through scribal corruption, the upper *bǐng* became □, and the lower *bǐng* became *zhǐ* (只), rendering it unrecognizable. The *Zilin* writes it as *xī* (西), which should be *bǐng* (丙); this is the seal script form of *bǐng*, with an extra stroke mistakenly added below. The *Mu Tianzi Zhuan* writes '□□ as the right-hand attendant,' which is also a scribal error.\n\n**Further note:** \"For the main chariot, Zaofu served as charioteer\"—since Zaofu was the charioteer, he should not also be the one who 'presided over the chariot.' The phrase 'presided over the chariot' should include the character *wáng* (王). The king rode in the chariot, thus the king presided over it; in the next chariot, the king did not ride, so Boyi was designated to preside over it instead. The *Mu Tianzi Zhuan* writes 'the Son of Heaven presided over the chariot,' which serves as definitive evidence. The current text omits the character *wáng*, making it seem as if the one who presided over the chariot was also the charioteer, which does not correspond to the next chariot.\"\n\nWang Shumin states: \"The current text’s omission of the character *wáng* is correct. However, *wáng* should likely precede 'presided over the chariot,' so that 'the king presided over the chariot' matches the syntax of the following phrase, 'Boyi presided over the chariot.'\"\n\nThe *Shiwen* writes '□' as '□,' stating: \"Zaofu is pronounced *zàofǔ* (七到切). *Fù* is pronounced *fǔ*. The *Records of the Grand Historian* states: 'King Mu of Zhou rode the horses *Huáliú* and *Lǜ ěr*, with Zaofu as his charioteer, traveling a thousand *li* in a day.' □ is pronounced *tài*, and its seal script form is □. □ is pronounced *bǐng*, and the Stone Classics write it as □.\"\n\nThe *Zilin* states that *yǐn* is written as □, originally as □□, with the pronunciation *qí* for the upper character and *hé* for the lower—yet this offers no meaningful interpretation. The *Huainanzi* states: \"Qián and Jǔ Tàibǐng were charioteers, who removed the reins and bit, discarding the whip and goad.\" Gao You comments: \"These were ancient masters of the Dao skilled in driving.\" *Qián* is pronounced *qíyán* (其炎切), and *jǔ* is pronounced *zǐyú* (子余切).\n\nRen Dachun writes: \"□\" is written as \"□.\" The preface by Chen Jingyuan of the Song dynasty states that \"□□\" are the two characters \"Tàibǐng,\" indicating that the text Jingyuan saw wrote \"□\" rather than \"□,\" matching the current edition. Only the *Shiwen* writes □, preserving the ancient form. Wu Renchen states: \"In the *Shilin Yanyu*, Wang Qi of the Tang did not recognize the two characters □□. Now, examining the *Liezi*, □ is pronounced *bǐng*, but the source of the character □ remains unattested. Moreover, Wang Shizhen’s rendition of the two characters as □□ appears to be an error.\" Wu Renchen knew that the character □ derived from the *Liezi* but claimed that □ had no attested source—this is because he had only seen the current edition of the *Liezi* and not Lu Deming’s *Shiwen*.\n\nThe *Tongya* cites Tu Weizhen’s preface, which states: \"During the Tang, scholars debated □□, with only Wang Qi, Wang Yuanmei, and Hu Mingrui writing it as □ (a corruption of □) and □ (a corruption of □). Thus, what Wang Qi saw still rendered □□ as □□, hence his claim of not recognizing the two characters □□.\" Comparing this with Lu Deming’s *Shiwen*, which also writes □□, it is evident that in Tang-era editions, □ was often written as □. Though Wang Yuanmei and Hu Mingrui’s □□ is a scribal corruption of □□, the *Shiwen*’s original form as □□ can still serve as evidence for textual reconstruction.\n\nHowever, the *Shiwen* further states that beneath the character □, the original text reads \"□,\" with □ pronounced *qí* and □ pronounced *hé*—yet this offers no meaningful interpretation. Lu Deming likely meant that another edition wrote □□ as □□, where the upper □ is pronounced *qí* and the lower □ is pronounced *hé*, differing not only in the variant characters □□ but also in the pronunciation of *qí-hé* for □□ versus *tàibǐng* for □□.\n\nThe *Wuyin Jiyun* records: □ is pronounced *cúxī* (徂奚切), sharing the same initial as *qí*; □ is pronounced *húlà* (壶腊切), sharing the same initial as *hé*. This confirms that one edition reads □ as *qí* and □ as *hé*. However, since the *Huainanzi* writes it as *Tàibǐng*, while this edition reads *qí-hé*, which offers no meaningful interpretation, the definitive text writes □ as *tài* and □ as *bǐng*, not following the variant edition.\n\nFurther examination of the *Mu Tianzi Zhuan* reveals: \"□□ served as the right attendant.\" Since □ resembles □ and □ resembles □, scribal errors arose. Sun Yirang notes: In the *Shiwen*’s citation of the *Zilin*, \"云\" should be \"音.\" The *Yiqie Jing Yinyi* (Vol. 6) quotes the *Zilin* as *yǐn*, matching this text. All editions mistakenly write \"云,\" and Ren [Dachun] did not correct it.\n\nRegarding the chariots that followed: The right horse of the central pair was *Qúhuáng*, and the left was *Yúlún*; the left outer horse was *Dàolì*, and the right was *Shānzǐ*. Jiang Chaobo states: The *Erya* lists among horses *Xiǎolǐng Dàolì*; the *Guangya* writes it as *Táolì*; the *Yupian* as *Táolì*; and the *Records of the Grand Historian* (*Qin Annals*) as *Wēnlì*—all variant forms of *Dàolì*. The *Shiwen* notes: *Lì* is pronounced *lìyí* (力移切). *Dàolì* is the *Xiānlí* mentioned in the *Xunzi* (*Xiānlí* appears in the \"Xing E\" chapter).\n\nBoyi presided over the chariot. The *Shiwen* states: *Yāo* is pronounced *yúbiǎo* (于表切). Guo Pu comments: \"Boyi is a personal name.\" Canbai served as charioteer, and Benrong as the right attendant. Jiang Chaobo notes: According to the *Mu Tianzi Zhuan*, Benrong was a minister of the Gao clan who commanded the Seven Elite Warriors, though Zhang Zhan’s commentary does not elaborate.\n\nThey galloped a thousand *li* and arrived in the land of the Jusou clan. Wang Zhong states: *Jusou* is the *Qusou* mentioned in the *Tribute of Yu*. The *Shiwen* notes: *Jusou* is pronounced *Qusou*, the name of a Western Rong state. The Jusou clan presented the blood of a white swan for the king to drink. The *Shiwen* states: *Yǐn* is pronounced *yújìn* (于禁切). They offered the *dòng* of cattle and horses to wash the king’s feet. (Note: *Dòng* refers to milk.) They presented their most precious treasures to the exalted ruler and the two chariot attendants.\n\nThe *Shiwen* states: *dòng* is pronounced *zhúyòng* (竹用切); *xǐ* (wash) is pronounced *xiānlǐ* (先礼切); *chéng* (chariot) is pronounced *shízhèng* (实证切).\n\nHaving drunk, they departed and lodged at the slopes of Kunlun, on the northern bank of the Red Water. The *Shan Hai Jing* states: \"Kunlun Mountain has waters of five colors.\" The *Shiwen* notes: *Kunlun* is pronounced *Kūnlún* (昆论). The *Shan Hai Jing* also says: \"By the shores of the Flowing Sands, beyond the Red Water and before the Black Water, stands a great mountain called Kunlun’s Mound. There are cave-dwellers, known as the Queen Mother of the West.\" Another day, they ascended Kunlun’s Mound—some versions omit the character *yú* (于). The *Shiwen* records *qiū* (丘) as *□*, noting: *□* is the ancient form of *qiū* (mound). They beheld the palace of the Yellow Emperor. The *Shiwen* cites the *Xin Yu* by Lu Jia: \"The Yellow Emperor toured the four seas, ascended Kunlun Mountain, built a palace, and gazed from its heights, sealing it to bequeath to later generations.\" The *Shiwen* states: *yí* (诒) is pronounced *yí* (怡), meaning \"to transmit.\"\n\nThereupon, they paid homage to the Queen Mother of the West. The *Shiwen* cites the *He Tu Yu Ban*: \"The Queen Mother of the West dwells on Kunlun Mountain.\" The *Bamboo Annals* records: \"In the seventeenth year of his reign, King Mu journeyed west, met the Queen Mother of the West, and was received as a guest in the Bright Palace.\" They feasted atop the Jasper Pool. The Queen Mother of the West was a human—tiger-toothed, disheveled-haired, wearing a *shèng* headdress, and skilled in whistling. This is recorded in the *Shan Hai Jing*.\n\nThe Queen Mother of the West sang a lay for the king—a *yáo* (徒歌, unaccompanied song). The poem was titled *White Clouds*. The *Shiwen* states: *wèi* (为) is pronounced *yú’é* (于讹切). The king responded—*hé* (和) meaning \"to answer.\" His poem was titled *Returning East*. The *Shiwen* states: *hé* (和) is pronounced *húwò* (胡卧切). Her words were mournful.\n\nThey observed the place where the sun sets in the west. The *Mu Tianzi Zhuan* states: \"They ascended Yan Mountain in the west.\" The character *xī* (西) was originally written as *nǎi* (乃). Wang Yinzhi notes: *Yān* (焉) here means \"in this place,\" \"then,\" or \"thus.\" The *Zhao Hun* says: \"The shaman Yang then descended to summon.\" The *Far Roaming* chapter reads: \"Then he wandered and lingered.\" The *Liezi*’s \"King Mu of Zhou\" chapter states: \"Thereupon, they observed where the sun sets.\" These all attest to the ancient usage of *yān nǎi* (焉乃) as a compound. Wang Chongmin argues: Wang’s interpretation is incorrect. The original text read *xī* (西), a scribal error. The character *yān* (焉) should still conclude the preceding clause. Zhang’s annotation cites the *Mu Tianzi Zhuan*: \"They ascended Yan Mountain in the west.\" According to Guo Pu’s commentary on the *Mu Tianzi Zhuan*: \"Yanzi Mountain is where the sun sets.\" Yan Mountain lies west of the Jasper Pool, marking the sun’s setting. Zhang’s citation clarifies the meaning of \"observing the west.\" The *Taiping Yulan* (vol. 3) quotes it as \"observed the place where the sun sets in the west,\" with only minor variations but retaining the character *xī* (西). The Ji edition correctly writes *xī* (西). Bo Jun notes: Wang Chongmin’s argument is sound. *Nǎi* (乃) was a graphic corruption of *xī* (西), and the text is now emended following the Ji edition. The *Shiwen* states: *yǎn* (弇) is pronounced *yǎn* (奄).\n\nJiang Chaobo observes: The block-printed editions of the *Mu Tianzi Zhuan* are fragmentary and incomplete; only Guo Pu’s commentary on the *Shan Hai Jing* preserves a more coherent version. His citation reads: \"On the auspicious day of *jiǎzǐ*, they paid homage to the Queen Mother of the West, presenting a black jade tablet and white jade disk as gifts. They offered a hundred strands of brocade and a hundred *jin* of gold and jade. The Queen Mother of the West bowed twice in acceptance. On *yǐchǒu*, the Son of Heaven feasted with the Queen Mother of the West atop the Jasper Pool. The Queen Mother of the West sang a lay for the Son of Heaven:\n\n*White clouds drift in the sky,*\n*The mountains and hills rise on their own.*\n*The Way stretches far and distant,*\n*Separated by rivers and mountains.*\n*May you not die, my lord,*\n*And come again.*\n\nThe Son of Heaven replied:\n\n*I return to the eastern lands,*\n*To harmonize and govern the Central States.*\n*When the myriad people are equitable and just,*\n*I shall turn to see you once more.*\n*Within three years,*\n*I shall return to your wilds.*\n\nThe Queen Mother of the West then chanted for the Son of Heaven:\n\n*Departing for those western lands,*\n*You dwell where you belong.*\n*Tigers and leopards gather in packs,*\n*Birds and magpies nest beside you.*\n*Your noble mandate does not waver,*\n*For I am the Emperor’s daughter.*\n*What manner of mortal are you,*\n*Who would now leave me?*\n*Playing the reed pipes and drums,*\n*My heart soars within.*\n*O child of this mortal world,*\n*You are Heaven’s hope.*\n\nThereupon, the Son of Heaven drove his chariot up Yan Mountain, where he inscribed his tracks upon its stones and planted a locust tree, naming it the Mountain of the Queen Mother of the West.\" They traveled ten thousand *li* in a single day. The *Shiwen* writes *wàn xíng* (万行), noting: *xíng* (行) is read as *lǐ* (里).\n\nThe king sighed and said: \"Alas! I alone am deficient in virtue yet harmonious in joy. Later generations will surely recount my transgressions!\" *Xié* (谐) here means \"to distinguish.\"\n\nFrom \"Thereupon he commanded his eight steeds to be harnessed\" up to this point, the events are recorded in the *Tale of King Mu*. The *Shiwen* notes: *shù* (数) is read as *sèjù*, meaning \"to reproach.\"\n\nHow near to a divine being was King Mu! *Here meaning: he was not divine.*\n\nWu Kaisheng remarks: *jǐ* (几) should be read as *qǐ* (岂, \"how could\"). The following line, \"How could it be empty words?\" serves as evidence. The *Shiwen* notes: *jǐ* is pronounced *qǐ*.\n\nHe exhausted the joys of his own lifetime—the *Shiwen* notes: *lè* (乐) is pronounced *luò*—yet after a hundred years, he still passed away. *Knowing the impermanence of worldly affairs, he gave free rein to his heart.* Bo Jun observes: The *Book of Jin*’s biography of Shu Xi cites the *Bamboo Annals*, stating, \"From the Zhou’s receipt of the Mandate to King Mu’s reign, a hundred years had passed,\" leading later generations to mistakenly believe King Mu lived a hundred years. The world deemed him to have ascended.\n\n*The character 假 here should be written as 遐, meaning the world believed he had \"ascended afar,\" clarifying that he had in fact died.*\n\n*[Exegesis]*\nSelecting swift steeds and discerning worthy talents, he applied them as circumstances demanded. Unbound by the distinction between Chinese and foreign lands, he followed only where the Dao led. Without venturing far from the Palace of the Yellow Emperor, he exhausted all that heaven and earth possess, reaching the utmost of what divine knowledge can convey. He did not exalt virtue to flaunt his power but delighted in the Dao to commune with the divine. After a thousand years, he *transfigured* and ascended—yet the common folk believed he had merely \"ascended afar.\"\n\nQin Enfu remarks: The character *□* in the exegesis does not appear in dictionaries. The *Jiyun* includes the character *□*, pronounced *qí*, an ancient form of *qì* (跂), though its meaning here is unclear. Sun Yirang notes: The exegesis’s *□化* should read *肢化* (*zhīhuà*), meaning \"corpse-transformation\" (a form of Daoist liberation). Qin’s citation of *□* as an ancient form of *qì* does not suit this context. The *Shiwen* notes: *jiǎ* (假) is pronounced *xiá*.\n\nLao Chengzi studied illusion under Master Yin Wen. Wang Chongmin observes: The *Taiping Imperial Encyclopedia* (752) cites this as \"Kao Chengzi,\" matching the *Shiwen* version. The *Shiwen* reads *lǎo* (老) as *kǎo* (考), noting: \"Kao Chengzi\" appears in one version, while another gives \"Lao Chengzi,\" author of eighteen chapters. Ren Dachun adds: The *Xingshi Jijiu Pian* (\"Quick Access to Surnames\") records, \"The Lao Cheng clan: the *Shi Ben* mentions Song minister Lao Cheng Fang. The *Liezi* states Lao Cheng studied illusion under Yin Wen. The *Treatise on Arts and Letters* lists *Lao Chengzi*.\" Thus, the version Hong Mai saw in the *Liezi* read \"Lao Chengzi,\" matching the current text. After three years, he did not report his progress. Lao Chengzi requested to be corrected and sought leave to depart.\n\nYin Wen bowed and led him into the chamber. Dismissing his attendants, he spoke to him, saying:\n\n\"When the Old Master Lao Dan departed for the West, he turned to me and said: 'The qi of living beings and the forms of corporeal things are all illusion. What the Creator begins and what yin and yang transform are called life and death. Those who exhaust the numbers and comprehend the changes, following form to shift and alter, are called transformation and illusion.'\n\n[Commentary] Those who master the numbers of the Two Modes and grasp the principles of yin and yang shape and move the myriad forms without perceiving the difficulty. The Creator’s craft is subtle, its work profound—inherently difficult to exhaust or bring to an end.\n\n[Commentary] Does the Creator have intent? It is naturally and seemingly subtle.\n\nWhen qi and substance press and thin, congealing into form, they follow transformation and depart, thus not immediately dissipating.\n\nTao Hongqing observes: Zhang’s commentary fails to grasp the meaning of *miao* (妙). The original character for *miao* should be *miao* (秒), also written as *miao* (妙). In the first chapter of the *Dao De Jing*, 'Constantly desireless, one observes its subtlety,' Wang Bi’s commentary states: '*Miao* is the utmost of the minute.' Its subtlety refers to its craft being so minute and wondrous as to be unknowable. This contrasts with the following phrase, 'Those who rely on form have craft that is manifest and work that is shallow.'\n\nBo Jun notes: The *Taiping Imperial Encyclopedia* (725) cites this as 'thus difficult to exhaust or bring to an end,' with *gu* (固) as *gu* (故), which better suits the meaning.\n\n[Commentary] *Fen* is pronounced *fèn* (房吻切).\n\nThose who rely on form have craft that is manifest and work that is shallow, thus arising and vanishing in an instant.\n\n[Commentary] Those who borrow things to enact change, or who follow form in its shifts, are but briefly born and briefly extinguished. Their work is evident, their deeds conspicuous, so all things are startled.\n\nOnly when one knows that illusion and transformation do not differ from life and death can one begin to study illusion.\n\n[Commentary] The meaning of this has already been detailed in the commentary on the chapter title.\n\nLu Wenchang notes: In the Zang edition, the commentary includes the character *jian* (见) after *zhu* (注).\n\nWang Chongmin states: *Yu* (与) here means *yi* (以), as explained in *Shi Ci*.\n\nThis means one may then begin to study illusion. The *Taiping Imperial Encyclopedia* (752) cites this as 'one may then begin to study illusion,' with different wording but the same meaning.\n\nYou and I are also illusion—why must you study?\"\n\n[Commentary] The body itself is illusion; to study illusion further is to have illusion study illusion.\n\n[Exegesis] The transformations of form and qi are ever-renewing and unceasing—how do they differ from illusion? Thus, what the spirit and qi transform endures long and is difficult to know, while what techniques and arts produce is near and easily seen. Yet one does not realize that what is difficult to know is the greater illusion, and what is easily seen is the lesser illusion. If one knows that illusion and transformation do not differ from life and death, why study further?\n\n[Commentary] *Fu* is pronounced *fù* (扶又切).\n\nLao Chengzi returned home and, applying Yin Wen’s words, meditated deeply for three months.\n\n[Commentary] *Shen* (深) is written as *yin* (淫), pronounced *shēn* (深).\n\nRen Dachun states: In the *Nine Hymns* of the *Chu Ci*, 'floating without root' is glossed as 'one version reads *chen* (沉), meaning deep and profound.' In the *Stratagems of Yan* from the *Warring States*, 'his wisdom is deep and his plans profound,' the commentary states: '*Chen* means deep.' In the *Records of the Grand Historian*, *Treatise on Music*: 'The sound is excessive and reaches the Shang.' Wang Su comments: 'The sound is deeply excessive and avaricious for Shang.' This confirms that *yin* (淫) is glossed as *shen* (深). Moreover, in this text, *yin* (淫) and *shen* (深) are often interchangeable. In the *Yellow Emperor* chapter, 'He will dwell in a measure that is not *shen* (深),' the commentary states: '*Shen* should be *yin* (淫).' *Yin* is read as *shen*, and *shen* is also read as *yin*—their meanings are interchangeable.\n\nThereafter, he could freely control life and death, manipulating the four seasons.\n\nWu Kaisheng notes: *Fan jiao* (□校) means to manipulate or play with.\n\n[Commentary] *Fan* is pronounced *fān* (翻). *Jiao* is pronounced *jiǎo* (绞). Gu Yewang reads it as *fan jiao* (翻交) of the four seasons.\n\nIn winter, he summoned thunder; in summer, he created ice. What flew ran, and what ran flew.\n\n[Commentary] If deep contemplation for a time can yield such mastery, how much more so for one who attains it without effort? Life must follow principle, and form must follow life. There has never been life without principle, nor form without life. Life and form, form and principle—though differing in refinement and coarseness—alternate as guest and host. They flow and shift in ceaseless succession, never pausing even briefly. Thus, they are ever-changing and never fixed, now gathering, now dispersing. When governed with order, their work is subtle and their deeds concealed; when cultivation loses measure, their traces become manifest and their transformations evident. Now, if the commands of the four seasons are disrupted, the three luminaries fall into disorder. Thunder and ice reverse their seasons, vessels and objects melt and scorch, so that flying things smelt clouds and sand to form billowing ice. When this occurs as usual, none doubt it. Extending this principle, if one exhausts the subtle numbers of yin and yang and fathoms the nature of the myriad things, one can shape and mold all beings, equaling the work of Creation. As for those who partially grasp techniques and draw upon qi and substance, bending and rising to emerge and submerge, glancing to exchange flight and running for altered forms—these are but the lesser arts.\n\n[Commentary] The phrase *bing hong* (冰澒) in all editions is mistakenly written as *shui qing* (水顷).\n\n[Commentary] *Shuo* is pronounced *shuò* (铄). *Hong* is pronounced *hóng* (洪).\n\nFor the rest of his life, he never revealed his arts.\n\n[Commentary] *Zhuo* (箸) is written as *zhuó* (着), pronounced *zhù* (陟虑切).\n\nThus, the world never transmitted them.\n\n[Commentary] That the Hundred Clans use it without knowing—this is the Way of the Sage.\"\n\nRevealing marvels to astonish an age—this is the affair of common men.\n\n[Exegesis] One who fathoms the root of spirit and qi and discerns the source of life and death can then transform without limit; this is the necessary principle. It must be realized through personal awakening and embodied verification, and thus cannot be transmitted through words or texts.\n\nYu Yue notes: \"Thus\" in Lu Chongxuan’s edition reads \"indeed.\" *Indeed* and *thus* are interchangeable—this is the ancient version. Zhang Zhan’s edition arbitrarily alters it to *thus*, which no longer preserves the antiquity of the original text.\n\nMaster Liezi said: \"One skilled in transformation follows a Way that is subtle and ordinary, and their achievement is the same as others’.\n\n[Commentary] They merely seek to benefit the world and pacify things, and so their achievement works in hiddenness, unknown to others.\n\n[Phonetic Gloss] *Yǐ* is pronounced *yǐ*.\n\nThe virtue of the Five Emperors and the achievements of the Three Kings were not necessarily all due to the strength of wisdom or courage; some were accomplished through transformation. Who could fathom it?\n\n[Commentary] The merit and virtue of emperors and kings are named by the world, not what makes them emperors and kings. Whether yielding the throne or wielding weapons, these are but borrowed paths—why should they not also borrow illusory transformation? Yet the traces that astonish the world are what the Sage employs in secrecy, never revealing them.\n\n[Phonetic Gloss] *Wéi zhī wéi* is pronounced *wéi zhī wěi* (于伪切).\n\nThe manifestations of waking perception number eight—*Phonetic Gloss*: *jué* is pronounced *jiào*—while the signs of dreaming number six. *[Commentary]* *Zhēng* means verification; *hòu* means divination. The divination of the six dreams is explained in the *Rites of Zhou*. *Phonetic Gloss*: *xiàn* is pronounced *xián* (贤遍切).\n\nWhat are the eight manifestations? The first is *gù* *[Commentary]* *Gù* means affairs. The second is *wéi* *[Commentary]* *Wéi* means action. *Táo Hóngqìng notes*: *Gù* refers to abandoning the old, while *wéi* refers to pursuing the new, forming pairs with the following *dé* and *sàng*, *āi* and *lè*, *shēng* and *sǐ*. *Zhang’s commentary* is unclear. The third is *dé* (gain), the fourth is *sàng* (loss) *[Phonetic Gloss]* *sàng* is pronounced *sàng* (息浪切). The fifth is *āi* (sorrow), the sixth is *lè* (joy) *[Phonetic Gloss]* *lè* is pronounced *luò*. The seventh is *shēng* (life), the eighth is *sǐ* (death). These eight manifestations are what form engages. *Yú Yuè notes*: It should read, \"These eight are what form engages,\" to parallel the following \"These six are what spirit intersects.\" *Wáng Chóngmín states*: Yu’s suggestion is correct. The *Jífǔ* edition reads, \"These eight manifestations are what form engages.\" It appears an extra *zhēng* was mistakenly inserted, later moved beneath *zhě*, though the *Jífǔ* edition still preserves traces of this. *Wáng Shūmín notes*: The *Dàozàng* edition, citing *Fàn Zhìxū’s* commentary, reads, \"These eight are what form engages,\" matching Yu’s suggestion. The *Bàibiān* (65) cites it as \"These eight manifestations are what form engages,\" aligning with the *Jífǔ* edition. The *zhēng* is not a superfluous character; it likely originally read, \"These eight manifestations are what form engages,\" to parallel the following \"These six signs are what spirit intersects.\" In the current text, the *hòu* beneath *liù* has been omitted (as discussed later), rendering this passage garbled and unreadable. The *Emperor Huīzōng’s* commentary reads, \"Thus it is said, 'These eight verifications are what form engages'\" (using *zhèng* to gloss *zhēng*), indicating his edition was correct.\n\nWhat are the six signs? The first is *zhèngmèng* (ordinary dreams) *[Commentary]* Dreaming in ordinary circumstances. The second is *èmèng* (startling dreams) *[Commentary]* The *Rites of Zhou* commentary states: *È* should be *è* (startling), meaning dreams arising from fright. *[Phonetic Gloss]* *È* is pronounced *è*. The third is *sīmèng* (thought dreams) *[Commentary]* Dreams arising from contemplation. The fourth is *wùmèng* (waking dreams) *[Commentary]* Dreams occurring while awake and recounting them. *[Phonetic Gloss]* *Wù* is pronounced *wù*. The fifth is *xǐmèng* (joyful dreams) *[Commentary]* Dreams arising from happiness. The sixth is *jùmèng* (fearful dreams) *[Commentary]* Dreams arising from terror. These six are what spirit intersects. *[Commentary]* The main point of this chapter is to clarify that waking and dreaming are not distinct. *Wáng Shūmín notes*: The *Emperor Huīzōng’s* commentary reads, \"Thus it is said, 'These six signs are what spirit intersects.'\" His edition includes *hòu* beneath *liù*, paralleling the earlier \"These eight manifestations are what form engages.\" This should be restored. The *Cǎotáng Shījiān Bǔyí* (4) cites the text with *mèng* beneath *liù*, further proving the current edition omits characters. *Bó Jùn observes*: According to *Lú’s* commentary below—\"Yet waking has eight manifestations, dreaming six signs\"—and \"knowing the constant transformations of the eight manifestations and six signs,\" this supports *Wáng Shūmín’s* argument.\n\nThose who do not recognize the origins of sensory changes are perplexed by events when they arise, while those who recognize their origins understand them as they occur. Understanding their origins, one remains unalarmed. *[Commentary]* All transformations and actions arise from causes. Those who do not investigate their roots when events have yet to occur are inevitably confused. Truly recognizing their origins, even amid myriad strange occurrences, the mind remains unshaken. *[Exegesis]* By emptying the mind, quieting thoughts, reflecting inward, and preserving spirit, one can penetrate all sensory barriers and transform all living beings. Yet people only see the traces of such transformations, not the root of their efficacy. Why? Because the Dao operates in secrecy and is difficult to perceive, its achievements indistinguishable from human affairs. Thus, the Five Emperors and Three Kings are known only for their strength and wisdom, not for their accomplishments through transformation. Yet the eight manifestations of waking and six signs of dreaming encompass all human experiences. *Gù*, *wéi*, *dé*, *sàng*, *āi*, *lè*, *shēng*, and *sǐ* are what form engages; *zhèng*, *è*, *sī*, *wù*, *xǐ*, and *jù* are what spirit intersects. What form engages is deemed waking; what spirit intersects is deemed dreaming. Though waking and dreaming differ in expression, in transformation they are never distinct. Knowing the constant transformations of the eight manifestations and six signs is to recognize their origins. Understanding that preserving spirit without disturbance gives rise to transformation, what manifestations or signs could ever cause alarm? *[Phonetic Gloss]* *Dá* is pronounced *dá* (丁达切). *Jué* is pronounced *jué*.\n\nThe waxing and waning, ebb and flow of a single being all resonate with Heaven and Earth and respond to all things. *[Commentary]* Humans share qi with yin and yang and parallel Heaven and Earth in form; fortune and misfortune alternate, inevitably interconnected. Thus, when yin qi is strong, one dreams of wading through great waters in terror *[Commentary]* Losing harmony, one is overwhelmed and fearful. *[Phonetic Gloss]* *Rú* is pronounced *rú*. When yang qi is strong, one dreams of traversing great fires and being scorched—*the character is erroneous*. The *Lǐjì: Jiāotèshēng* *[Commentary]* Fire’s nature is fierce and violent; encountering it leads to scorching. *[Phonetic Gloss]* *Gài* is pronounced *yuè* (如悦切). *Jìngshùn’s* commentary in the *Phonetic Gloss* correctly uses *gài*, also pronounced *yuè*. This is not *Gù’s* original text but a later interpolation, which should be corrected accordingly—it is evident the error had not yet occurred in the Tang dynasty.\n\nThe *Yùpiān* includes this character. However, the *Xīgǔ Yì Cóngshū* fragment of the *Yùpiān* lacks the \"fire\" section, leaving no means to verify it. The *Phonetic Gloss* states: *fán* is pronounced *fán*. *Gài* is pronounced *yuè* (如悦切).\n\nWhen both yin and yang qi are strong, one dreams of life and death.\n*[Commentary]* Yin and yang function through harmony. When they contend, they harm one another, hence dreams of life or death.\n*[Phonetic Gloss]* *Kàng* may also be written as *kàng* (亢).\n\nWhen overly sated, one dreams of giving; when ravenous, one dreams of taking.\n*[Commentary]* Surfeit leads to the desire to bestow; want leads to the desire to seize. This, too, mirrors waking reality.\n*[Note]* The phrase \"desire to seize\" appears as \"wading to seize\" (*shè qǔ*) in the Northern Song edition and Wang’s edition; the present text follows the *Daozang* edition’s emendation.\n\nThus, those afflicted by floating emptiness dream of soaring; those burdened by sinking solidity dream of drowning.\nWhen sleeping atop one’s sash, one dreams of serpents.\n*[Phonetic Gloss]* *Jiè* is pronounced *jì* (慈夜切).\nWhen a bird grasps one’s hair in flight, one dreams of flying.\n*[Commentary]* This arises from resonance with external things.\n*[Note]* The *Zàng* edition includes an \"而\" after \"类\" and a \"也\" at the end of the commentary.\n\nApproaching yin, one dreams of fire; nearing illness, one dreams of food.\nThose who drink wine grieve; those who sing and dance weep.\n*[Commentary]* These illustrate the nature of dreams: some arise from resonance with events, others from extremes inverting into their opposites—aligning with the *Zhōulǐ*’s six dreams and six principles, for such patterns are never groundless.\n*[Exegesis]* When spirit and qi cling to phenomena, transformations follow; when yin and yang interact, dreams shift. Some responses arise from past extremes, some traces appear through resemblance, some manifest causes as realities, while others invert logic yet fail to express true feeling. For those who concentrate their minds to grasp the real and darkly align with the Dao, clarity transcends change—neither sorrow nor joy can enter.\nTáo Hóngqìng observes: Both \"those who drink wine grieve\" and \"those who sing and dance weep\" should begin with the word \"dream.\"\nBó Jùn notes: Táo is correct. The *Zhuāngzǐ: Qíwù Lùn* states, \"One who dreams of drinking wine wakes to weep; one who dreams of weeping wakes to hunt,\" differing slightly in phrasing but sharing the inclusion of \"dream.\"\n*[Further Note]* In the exegesis, the character \"未\" in \"or invert logic yet fail to express true feeling\" is superfluous.\n*[Phonetic Gloss]* *Zào* is pronounced *qī* (七到切).\n\nMaster Lièzǐ said: \"Spiritual encounter gives rise to dreams; physical contact gives rise to events.\"\n*[Commentary]* As *Zhuāngzǐ* states: \"In sleep, spirits commune; in waking, forms unfold.\"\nBó Jùn notes: The *Tàipíng Yùlǎn* (397) quotes this as \"Thus, spiritual encounter gives rise to dreams,\" omitting \"Master Lièzǐ said\" and replacing it with \"Thus.\" The commentary’s citation of *Zhuāngzǐ* appears in the *Qíwù Lùn*; the present text reads \"魂交\" instead of \"神交.\"\n\nThus, daytime thoughts yield nighttime dreams—encounters of spirit and form.\n*[Commentary]* \"Thoughts\" here refer to waking concerns, not the common notion of daydreaming leading to subsequent dreams.\nTherefore, those whose spirits are concentrated find thoughts and dreams dissolve.\n*[Commentary]* Without waking cares, there are no dreams at night.\n\nIn truth, waking does not speak; in truth, dreams do not convey—these are the comings and goings of transformed things.\n*[Commentary]* Dreaming of being a bird and soaring to the heavens, dreaming of being a fish and diving into the depths—these are the transformations of feeling.\n*[Note]* The character \"戾\" originally appeared as \"厉,\" which also conveys meaning. However, the *Shījīng* (*Xiǎoyǎ: Sìyuè*) reads: \"Neither quail nor kite, soaring to the heavens; neither sturgeon nor salmon, diving into the depths\"—here, the text uses \"戾,\" which should be considered correct. The present text follows the *Zàng* edition’s emendation.\n\nThe true persons of antiquity forgot themselves in waking and slept without dreams.\n\n\"How could this be empty words?\"\n\n*[Commentary]* The true person forgets in all actions, even to the point of sleeplessness—how could there be dreams? This is also a parable to clarify the principle.\n\n*[Exegesis]* When the six senses are all engaged, people regard it as real; when consciousness acts alone, people regard it as illusory—both are called illusion. When one dreams and takes the dream as real, both are called truth. Yet they do not realize that waking is the movement of spirit, and dreaming is the activity of spirit. To believe one and not the other is to fail to comprehend. If one forgets the self, there are no dreams—how could there be another principle?\n\nQin Enfu remarked: The exegesis appears to have omissions and errors.\nWang Lai said: Above \"people regard it as illusory,\" four characters—\"people regard it as illusory\"—should be added. The four characters \"梦行\" and \"为梦\" are superfluous.\nBo Jun noted: The *Zhuangzi* (\"Ke Yi\" chapter) states: \"The sage’s life is the movement of Heaven; their death is the transformation of things. [...] Their sleep is dreamless; their waking is carefree.\" (Text omitted.) The \"Da Zong Shi\" chapter is largely the same. The *Huainanzi* (\"Chu Zhen Xun\") says: \"The sage relies on the mind, leans on nature, and depends on spirit to complete the cycle—thus their sleep is dreamless, and their waking is carefree.\" All express this idea.\n*[Pronunciation Note]* 几 is pronounced *qǐ*.\n\nIn the southwestern corner of the farthest west lies a state. *[Pronunciation Note]* 隅 is written as 嵎 in the *Exegesis*. It notes: 嵎 and 隅 are interchangeable. Ren Dachun observes: The *Exegesis* of the *Erya*’s \"Shui\" chapter states: \"隅 is also written as 嵎隅, both pronounced *yúxū*.\" The *Shuowen* says: \"嵎 is the Fengyu Mountain, located in the state of Wangmang between Wu and Chu. It is composed of 山 and 禺 phonetic.\" Xu Kai notes: The *Guoyu* reads: \"The Lord of Fangfeng guarded the Fengyu Mountain.\" The present *Luyu* states: \"The lord of the Wangmang clan guarded the Fengyu Mountain.\" Wei Zhao comments: \"Feng is Mount Feng; Yu is Mount Yu.\" Thus, 嵎 and 隅 are interchangeable. Furthermore, the *Suoyin* to the *Records of the Grand Historian*’s \"Xia Benji\" states: \"The modern *Shangshu* and *Di Ming Yan* both write 禺铁.\" 禺 is the same as 嵎, so 嵎, 隅, and 禺 are all interchangeable.\n\nIts borders are unknown, and it is called the State of Ancient Wilderness. *[Pronunciation Note]* 莽 is pronounced *mǎng*. The qi of yin and yang do not intermingle, so cold and heat are indistinguishable. *[Variant]* 辨 is written as 辩 below. *[Pronunciation Note]* 亡 is pronounced *wú* below. The light of the sun and moon does not reach it, so day and night are indistinguishable. Its people neither eat nor wear clothing but sleep excessively. They awaken once every fifty days, believing what they do in dreams to be real and what they perceive while awake to be illusory.\n\nThe Central State, as the four seas call it—*[Annotation]* that is, the lands within the four seas. Tao Hongqing says: 齐 means \"central.\" 谓 is used interchangeably with 为. Bo Jun notes: The preceding text reads \"called the State of Ancient Wilderness,\" and the following text reads \"a state called the State of Flourishing Settlements,\" so 谓 here should share the same meaning as 名 and 曰 and should not be read as 为. Tao’s interpretation may be imprecise.\n\nIt spans north and south of the Yellow River—*[Pronunciation Note]* 跨 is pronounced *kuà*—and east and west of Mount Tai, extending over ten thousand *li*. Its yin and yang are measured precisely, so one cold and one heat alternate. Yu Yue says: The characters 审度 are transposed in transmission; the original reads \"阴阳之度审.\" The following sentence reads: \"其昏明之分察, 故一昼一夜.\" 度 pairs with 分, and 审 pairs with 察, making this clear. The division of darkness and light is distinct, so one day and one night alternate. *[Pronunciation Note]* 分 is pronounced *fèn*. Its people possess both wisdom and folly. The myriad things flourish, and skills and arts abound. There are rulers and subjects in hierarchy, and rituals and laws in mutual restraint. Their undertakings are beyond reckoning. They alternate between waking and sleeping, believing what they do while awake to be real and what they see in dreams to be illusory.\n\nIn the northeastern corner of the farthest east lies a state called the State of Flourishing Settlements. *[Pronunciation Note]* 阜 is pronounced *fù*. Its land is perpetually warm—*[Pronunciation Note]* 燠 is pronounced *yù*—and bathed in the lingering light of the sun and moon. Its soil does not yield fine crops. Its people eat grass roots and tree fruits, ignorant of cooked food. Their nature is fierce and violent, with the strong oppressing the weak—*[Pronunciation Note]* 藉 is pronounced *líng*. Bo Jun notes: 藉 should not be given the pronunciation *líng*. The *Exegesis* likely assumes 藉 corresponds to the 陵 in 陵轹 (as in the *Book of Later Han*’s *Zhu Fu Zhuan* commentary: \"陵轹 means to bully or despise\"), hence the *líng* pronunciation. Yet 藉 itself carries the meaning of oppression (as in the *Records of the Grand Historian*’s *Tian Ji Zhuan*: \"Now that I am alive, people all 藉 my brother,\" where the commentary glosses 藉 as \"to tread upon, to trample\"). There is no need to alter its reading. This passage may have been supplemented by Xiang Xuan. They value dominance and do not esteem righteousness.\n\nThe people there run swiftly and seldom rest, ever wakeful and never sleeping.\n\n*[Annotation]* Such differences in local customs—like the inversion of waking and dreaming, the divergence of activity and rest—are but adaptations to their respective regions, not grounds for mutual reproach.\n\n*[Exegesis]* Thus, though these two lands differ, the convergence of their spirits remains unchanged. Hence we know that the harmony of spiritual principle transcends distinctions of dreaming and waking, clothing and food. If one cannot forget desires, the emotions become bound to custom.\n\nTao Hongqing notes: \"In the southwest lies a land called the Ancient Wilderness,\" and so forth; \"in the northeast lies a land called the Land of Mound-Dwellers,\" and so forth. By modern geography, the characters for \"south\" and \"north\" should be transposed.\n\nDuring the Zhou dynasty, the House of Yin amassed vast wealth. *[Pronunciation Note]* 治 is pronounced *chí*.\n\nTheir subordinates, driven to labor, toiled from dawn till dusk without respite. The Qin edition reads 趣 as 趋. *[Pronunciation Note]* 趣 is pronounced *qū*, and so below. Ren Dachun observes: The *Records of the Grand Historian*’s *Zhang Yi Zhuan* states, \"He was about to harness his carriage and *qū* on his way,\" with the *Justice* glossing *qū* as *qù*. The *Sima Qian Zhuan* reads, \"*Qū*-shě take different paths,\" where *qū-shě* means *qū-shě*. The *Book of Han*’s *Jia Yi Zhuan* states, \"*Qū* into the hall to perform *Xià*.\" Here, *qū* is *qū*. Thus, Jing Shun’s *Pronunciation Note* reads *qū* as *qū*. Bo Jun notes: The character 趨 (qū) in common usage (see *Guangyun* under 十虞, and *Longkan Shoujian*) shares the same form as the 趨 (chí) in *Shuowen*’s \"趨趙\" but differs in sound and meaning.\n\nAn elderly laborer’s strength was utterly spent, *[Bo Jun’s Note]* The *Guanzi*’s *Qingzhong Ji* states: \"Those dwelling in villages are called *xiàchén*; those in towns, *xiàtōng*—these are *yìfū*.\" *Yìfū* is a term for the lowly, hence its use as an insult. The *Zuo Zhuan* of Duke Wen’s first year records: \"Jiang Qian grew angry and said, 'Bah! *Yìfū*! It is fitting that the king wished to kill you and install Zhi!'\" Yet he was made to toil even harder. By day, he groaned and moaned as he worked. *[Pronunciation Note]* 呻呼 is pronounced *shēn yín*, and so below. *[Bo Jun’s Note]* 呼 should not be given the pronunciation *yín*; the text may be corrupt or missing characters. Otherwise, it is likely that Jing Shun glossed 呼 as 吟, hence the annotation, unaware of its phonetic inaccuracy. By night, he sank into exhausted slumber. His spirit scattered and waned, and night after night, he dreamed he was a ruler. *[Qin Enfu’s Note]* 昔 and 夕 are phonetically close. *[Bo Jun’s Note]* The *Book of Songs* states, \"Enjoying wine *jīn-xī*,\" where *jīn-xī* means *jīn-xī* (this evening). The *Guliang Zhuan* reads, \"From sunset to starlight is called *xī*,\" where *xī* is 夕. The *Guanzi* states, \"*Dàn-xī* at work,\" where *dàn-xī* is *dàn-xī* (day and night). These all attest to the interchangeability of 昔 and 夕. *[Pronunciation Note]* 昔昔 means nightly. Enthroned above his people, he governed the affairs of the state. He roamed and feasted in palaces, indulging every desire, his joy unmatched. *[Pronunciation Note]* 燕 is pronounced *yàn*; 觀 is read *guàn*. *[Pronunciation Note]* 樂 is pronounced *lè*. Upon waking, he returned to servitude. *[Pronunciation Note]* 覺 is pronounced *jiào*, and so below. When others consoled and urged him to rest, the laborer said: \"A human life spans a hundred years, with day and night each taking half. *[Annotation]* 分 means half. By day, I am a slave, suffering greatly; by night, I am a lord, my joy unmatched. What cause have I for resentment?\"\n\nThe House of Yin, consumed by worldly affairs and fixated on family wealth, exhausted both mind and body. By night, he too sank into exhausted sleep, and night after night, dreamed he was a servant—running errands, performing every labor, enduring every task. He suffered countless scoldings and beatings, every torment. In his sleep, he muttered, groaned, and moaned. *[Annotation]* 啽 is pronounced *wú nán*; 呓 is pronounced *yì*. *[Pronunciation Note]* 啽 is pronounced *wú nán*; 呓 is pronounced *yì*. 啽呓 and 呻吟 both refer to sleep-talk. He did not wake until dawn. The House of Yin, afflicted by this, sought counsel from his friend.\n\nHis friend replied, \"Your rank suffices to bring you honor, and your wealth exceeds what you need—you surpass most men by far. To dream at night of being a servant is but the natural alternation of hardship and ease, a common occurrence. *[Annotation]* For prosperity and decline follow one another in turn, and when joy reaches its peak, sorrow arises. Thus, what one finds beautiful in waking life may turn foul in dreams. *[Pronunciation Note]* 恶 is pronounced *wū lù*. If you seek to enjoy both waking and dreaming states alike, how could that be possible?\"\n\nUpon hearing his friend’s words, the House of Yin eased the laborer’s tasks and reduced his own burdensome thoughts. *[Pronunciation Note]* 思 is pronounced *sì*. His illness gradually improved. *[Annotation]* This passage also illustrates that waking and dreaming are not distinct—pleasure and suffering each find their place. Thus, the laborer toils by day and finds rest by night, while the House of Yin enjoys honor by day and humiliation by night. If the principle does not encompass both, it is not sufficient to bridge the divide. *[Exegesis]* He who wearies the body but rests the spirit will feel fatigue in waking life yet peace in dreams; he who wearies the spirit but labors the body will find joy in waking life yet suffering in dreams. The spirit is the master of life, yet men do not know to nurture the spirit to calm the body. The body is the vessel of the spirit, yet men do not know to sustain the body to ease the spirit. Thus, when both body and spirit are exhausted, they exceed their proper measure. If labor and rest are balanced, illness will gradually improve.\n\n*[Textual Note]* In the annotation, \"则役夫\" originally appeared as \"明役夫\" in Wang’s edition; the present version follows other editions. \"适一方\" is also found as \"通一切\". *[Pronunciation Note]* 少间 means \"illness improves\" and is pronounced *shǎo jiàn*. The character 跨 is written as \"\" in the *Shiwen*, pronounced *kuā*.\n\nThere was a man from Zheng who gathered firewood in the wild. He chanced upon a startled deer and pursued it, striking it down. *[Annotation]* 御 means \"to meet\" or \"to intercept.\" *[Pronunciation Note]* 御 is pronounced *yà*, meaning \"to intercept.\" He killed it. *[Pronunciation Note]* 毙 is pronounced *bì*. Fearing others would see, he hastily concealed it in a dry moat. *[Pronunciation Note]* 隍 is pronounced *huáng*, referring to a moat without water. He covered it with firewood. *[Annotation]* Huang Sheng said: *Jiao* (蕉) and *qiao* (樵) were interchangeable in ancient script. *Qiao* means \"firewood,\" so the phrase means \"covered it with firewood.\" In the *Zhuangzi*’s \"Ren Jian Shi,\" it says, \"The dead are measured by the state as if they were firewood in the marsh,\" where the character is the same as here, referring to piled bones like firewood. Nowadays, *jiao* is used for the banana plant, while Sima Xiangru’s *Zi Xu Fu* writes it as *ba qie* (巴且). *[Pronunciation Note]* 蕉 is interchangeable with 樵. Overcome with joy... *[Pronunciation Note]* 胜 is pronounced *shēng*.\n\nShortly after, he forgot where he had concealed it and thus took it for a dream. As he traveled along the road, he recounted the tale in song. A passerby overheard him, followed his words, and retrieved the deer. Upon returning home, he told his wife, “A woodcutter once dreamed of obtaining a deer but forgot where it was—now that I have it, his was truly a dream!”\n\n*[Textual Note]* The character *zhe* (者) originally appeared after *meng* (梦). Yu Yue said: The original text read *bi zhi zhen meng yi* (彼直真梦矣), and *zhe* (者) was a superfluous addition. The Lu Chongxuan edition omits it. *[Editor’s Note]* Yu Yue’s observation is correct. Following the Qin engraving of the Lu Chongxuan edition and the *Sijie* edition, the character *zhe* (者) is deleted.\n\nHis wife replied, “Are you the one who dreamed of the woodcutter obtaining the deer? How could there be a woodcutter? Now that the deer is truly in your possession, is your dream the real one?”\n\nThe man said, “I have the deer—why trouble myself over whether his was a dream or mine?”\n\nThe woodcutter returned home, unwilling to accept the loss of the deer. *[Editor’s Note]* *Yan* (厌) is interchangeable with *qie* (愜). The *Shuowen* defines it as “contentment.” The *Book of Songs*’ “Xiao Rong” reads: *Yan yan liang ren* (厌厌良人), with the *Commentary* explaining *yan yan* as “tranquil.” Thus, *bu yan shi lu* (不厌失鹿) means “unwilling to resign himself to losing the deer.” *[Pronunciation Note]* *Yan* is pronounced *qiè*, or alternatively *yàn*.\n\nThat night, he truly dreamed of where he had hidden it and of the one who had taken it. At dawn, he followed his dream’s guidance and found the place. He then brought the matter to court to dispute ownership, and the case was referred to the *shishi*. *[Pronunciation Note]* *Shishi* refers to the official in charge of the five prohibitions.\n\nThe *shishi* said, “At first, you truly obtained the deer but falsely called it a dream; now, you truly dreamed of obtaining it but falsely call it real. He truly took your deer, and you dispute it with him.” Tao Hongqing said: The phrase *er yu ruo zheng lu* (而与若争鹿) should read *er ruo yu zheng lu* (而若与争鹿). Here, *zheng lu* (争鹿) refers to the one who lost the deer; below, *ju you ci lu* (据有此鹿) refers to the one who took it. Thus, I propose dividing it in two.\n\nThe wife also claimed that the deer belonged to the one who dreamed of it. *[Textual Note]* The *Jifu* and *Shidetang* editions write *ren* (认) instead of *ren* (仞). *[Pronunciation Note]* *Ren* is also written as *ren*.\n\n“No one truly obtained the deer. Now that one party possesses it, I propose dividing it in two.” The matter was reported to Lord Zheng, who exclaimed, “Hmph!”\n\nThe *Shiwen* notes: *Xi* (嘻) is pronounced *xi*. The judicial officer asked, “Will you once more divide a man’s deer based on a dream?” The *Shiwen* notes: *Fu* (复) is pronounced *fuyou*.\n\nHe consulted the state minister. The *Shiwen* notes: *Xiang* (相) is pronounced *xiliang*. The minister replied, “Whether one dreamed or not, your servant cannot discern. To distinguish waking from dreaming, only the Yellow Emperor and Confucius could do so.”\n\n[Annotation] How do sages discern waking from dreaming? Simply by knowing they are not different.\n\nThe *Shiwen* notes: *Xie* (邪) is pronounced *sizhe*. *Zhi* (直) may also be written as *zhen* (真).\n\n“Now that the Yellow Emperor and Confucius are gone,”—the *Shiwen* notes: *Wang* (亡) is pronounced *wu*—“who can discern it? Yu Zhengxie said: The *Shiji Zhengyi* quotes the *Diwang Shiji*, which states: ‘The Yellow Emperor dreamed of a great wind that blew away all the dust and grime of the world. He also dreamed of a man wielding a thousand-jun crossbow herding ten thousand sheep. Upon waking, the Emperor sighed and said: The wind is the herald of commands, the one who governs; the dust is removed, and earth remains—would there not be one surnamed Feng and named Hou? The thousand-jun crossbow is the instrument of extraordinary strength; herding ten thousand sheep is the work of one who can guide the people toward goodness—would there not be one surnamed Li and named Mu? Thereupon, he sought them according to these omens: he found Feng Hou at the edge of the sea and appointed him minister; he found Li Mu in the great marsh and made him general. The Yellow Emperor then compiled the *Omen Dream Classic* in eleven scrolls.’ His method of interpreting dreams followed the natural course of events and achieved success—truly, it was like *Xiangwang* obtaining the pearl. The *Lingshu* contains the *Yin Xie Fa Meng* chapter. The *Omen Dream Classic* is listed in the *Yiwen Zhi*. It is said: *The Yellow Emperor’s Long Willow Dream Interpretation*. Confucius’s dream between the pillars is recorded in the *Tan Gong*. To speak of discerning dreams by invoking the Yellow Emperor and Confucius—this is the meaning. Moreover, the judicial officer’s words may be trusted.”\n\n[Annotation] *Xun* (恂) means “trust,” pronounced *xun*. If one is deluded by joy and anger, one still cannot distinguish the reality of waking and dreaming—how much less when there is no waking or dreaming at all?\n\n[Exegesis] As for those who take it as a dream, it is merely deluded perception. When the spirit’s perception is unclear, it becomes a false dream. The one who overheard and took the deer was also unclear—this, too, was a dream. The one who obtained the deer then dreamed of seeking the deer and brought the case before the judicial officer. All were unclear. Their deluded sentiments were the same, hence the division in two. Only the sage could fully comprehend this delusion! But in an age without sages, matters lack certainty, so the judicial officer, unable to resolve what was unresolved, only added further delusion.\n\nWu Kaisheng said: *Xun* (恂) should be *xun* (徇). Bo Jun’s note: The *Shuowen* states: *Xun* (恂) means “sincere of heart.” The *Zuozhuan* for the eleventh year of Duke Wen reads: “The people of the state did not *xun*,” and Du’s commentary says: *Xun* (徇) means “to comply.” The *Shiwen* notes: *Xun* is pronounced *xun*, meaning “trust.”\n\nIn his middle years, Hua Zi of Yangli in Song suffered from forgetfulness. The *Shiwen* notes: *Hua* (华) is pronounced *huahua*. *Wang* (忘) is pronounced *wang*, meaning he could not remember things. What he took in the morning, he forgot by evening; what he gave in the evening, he forgot by morning.\n\nWhile on the road, he forgot his journey; while in his chamber, he forgot his seat. He knew not the present, nor could he distinguish past from future.\n\nWang Chongmin said: The two lines *\"Now he knew not the past, later he knew not the present\"* are erroneous. The *Taiping Yulan* (738) cites them as *\"He knew not past from future, nor present from ancient times,\"* which is closer to the mark.\n\nHis entire household suffered from this affliction. The *Shiwen* notes: *Hé* (阖) is pronounced *hulà*. *Dú* (毒) means \"suffering.\"\n\nThey consulted scribes and divined, but the omens were not revealed. Wu Kaisheng said: *Fú zhān* (弗占) means \"were not verified.\" Bo Jun’s note: The *Xunzi*’s \"Rhapsodies\" reads: *\"I beg to divine it with the Five Powers,\"* and Yang Liang’s commentary states: *\"Zhān* means 'to verify.'\"\n\nThey entreated shamans and prayed, but the affliction was not averted. They summoned physicians and treated him, but the condition did not abate.\n\nIn Lu, a Confucian scholar offered himself as one able to cure Hua Zi. His wife and children offered half of their stored wealth in exchange for his remedy. Tao Hongqing said: *Jū* (居) means \"stored,\" referring to their long-accumulated possessions. The *Tianrui* chapter’s *\"exhausting their ancestral stored wealth\"* carries the same meaning.\n\nThe Confucian scholar said: \"This is certainly not a matter for divination by milfoil and tortoise-shell. [Note] For when the subtle workings arise there, the yarrow and oracle bones respond here, so fortune and misfortune may be inferred from the hexagrams, and hidden truths may be sought through images and numbers. But now, the heart of the forgetful man is as still as cold ashes, as vast and empty as an abandoned house. The sage would find no place to apply his discernment—how could this be a matter for divination by hexagrams?\" The *Shiwen* notes: *Shī* (蓍) is pronounced *shī*. *Nì* (匿) is pronounced *nìlì*. *Pò* (泊) is pronounced *pò*. *Jiàn* (鉴) is pronounced *jiàn*.\n\nNor is it a matter for prayers and supplications. [Note] For sincerity and compliance may invoke blessings, and upright integrity may dispel deceit and falsehood—this is the natural order. Thus, those who feel shame before the spirits or incur resentment in human affairs inevitably bring ruin upon themselves. But when one’s emotions are not singularly deluded and one’s conduct is not wildly perverse, this is not a matter for prayers and supplications.\" The *Shiwen* records *\"zì jí\"* (自极) as *\"zì zhěng\"* (自拯), noting: *Zhěng* (拯) is pronounced with the rising tone, originally written as *jí* (极). *Xíng* (行) is pronounced *xiàmèng*. *Pì* (僻) is pronounced *pì*. Bo Jun’s note: *Jí* (极) means \"afflicted and distressed,\" a common expression in Wei-Jin texts. Those unfamiliar with this meaning altered it to *zhěng* (拯), rendering the passage incoherent. This entry in the *Shiwen* appears to have been added by Xiang Xuan of the Jingyuan era, not part of Yin’s original text.\n\nNor is it a matter for medicine and stone needles.\"\n\nWhen chronic ailments lodge in the organs and acute illnesses disperse through the limbs and flesh, one must rely on pulse diagnosis to discern excess and deficiency, and administer medicines and stone needles to attack the affliction. Yet if the heart is not disordered by craving, nor the body harmed by cold or heat, then the physician’s art ought to be set aside.\n\nThe annotation notes: *Jiù’ē* (疚痾) is also written as *jíbìng* (疾病), *téng’ē* (疼痾), or *jí’ē* (疾痾). The Northern Song edition reads *gōng màizhěn* (攻脉诊) for *jiǎ màizhěn* (假脉诊), and *shíyù* (食欲) for *shìyù* (嗜欲), but neither variant improves the meaning. The *Shiwen* records: *Jiù* is pronounced *jiù*; *ē* as *ē*; *zàng* as *cáng*; *zhěn* as *zhěn*.\n\nI shall attempt to transform his heart and alter his thoughts—perhaps then he may recover!\n\nThe annotation notes: The utterly forgetful have no thoughts at all—what is there to transform? This passage itself admits it is easier to instill thought than to remove it, or easier to instill worry than to dispel it; the phrasing merely shifts direction. The variant *luàn* (乱) for *cí* (辞) is likely an error. The *Shiwen* records: *Chōu* is pronounced *chōu*.\n\nThereupon, I exposed him to the cold, and he sought clothing; I starved him, and he sought food; I confined him in darkness, and he sought light.\n\nThe annotation notes: First, I deprived him of what assailed him to test his response.\n\nA Confucian scholar joyfully told his son: “The illness can be cured! Yet my method is secret—the *Shiwen* punctuates: *Rán wú zhī fāng mì* (然吾之方密) as a complete phrase—and I do not transmit it to others. Try sending away your attendants and remain alone with me in the chamber for seven days.” He complied. The *Shiwen* records: *Cóng* is pronounced *zòng*.\n\nLu Bujun notes: *Cóng* (从) should be read in its standard sense, meaning \"to comply with.\" The *Shiwen* is in error. No one knew what methods he employed—[Annotation:] The Confucian scholar’s many techniques were not confined to a single path of verification. Yet the illness of many years vanished in a single morning. [Annotation:] The preceding passage states that where shamans and physicians had exhausted their arts in vain, the Confucian scholar alone could cure what ailed him. First, it cites Huazi’s forgetting as akin to spontaneity, demonstrating the ultimate state of non-contrivance, which cannot be restored through mere techniques. The Confucian scholar’s achievement surpassed that of shamans and physicians, proving that when principle is not obscure, one may employ diverse methods to guide the afflicted. It further sought to awaken the forgetful one to the realization that his former oblivion nearly approached the supreme principle. [Exegesis:] Laozi said: \"In the pursuit of learning, one daily accumulates; in the pursuit of the Dao, one daily diminishes. Diminish and again diminish, until one reaches non-action.\" Huazi studied the Dao and forgot his own existence, while the Confucian scholar studied the manifest to augment his knowledge. One who augments knowledge must distinguish right and wrong before his eyes; one who forgets existence remains unmoved by gain or loss in the celestial storehouse. How could divination or medicine ever cure such a condition? Thus, the Confucian scholar used manifold methods to entice his mind, and right and wrong confounded his thoughts. Huazi thereby lost the Dao and afterward virtue; having lost virtue, right and wrong raced through his breast, and so the art of \"sitting in forgetfulness\" was lost. [Annotation:] Below *yǒu guò* (有过), the Zang edition includes the particle *hū* (乎). Wang Lai states: In the exegesis, the second *zhī* (之) in *sǔn zhī yòu sǔn zhī* (损之又损之) is superfluous. Lu Bujun notes: According to Fan Yingyuan’s *Collected Commentaries on the Daodejing*, Peng Zun’s *Collected Commentaries on the Daodejing*, and the ancient editions, both *zhī* characters are present, matching the citation in *Chongxuan*. Thus, the second *zhī* is not superfluous, and Wang’s claim is mistaken. The *Shiwen* records: *Sī* is pronounced *sì*.\n\nHazi, now awakened, flew into a great rage, cast out his wife, punished his son, and seized a halberd to chase away the Confucian scholar. Lu Bujun notes: The *Zuozhuan* for the twenty-third year of Duke Xi records: \"Jiang said, ‘Go! Clinging to comfort will surely ruin your reputation.’ The prince refused. Jiang plotted with Zifan, got him drunk, and sent him away. When he awoke, he took up a halberd to pursue Zifan.\" The ancients regarded the halberd as a personal weapon, hence its frequent mention in ancient texts as *cāo gē* (操戈). The *Shiwen* records: *Cāo* is pronounced *qī dāo*. The people of Song seized him and demanded an explanation.\n\nHazi said, \"Before, I was in oblivion—so vast and boundless that I did not perceive the existence or nonexistence of heaven and earth. Now, suddenly awakened to the past, the myriad threads of life and death, gain and loss, sorrow and joy, love and hate have arisen in tumult. The *Shiwen* notes: *shù* is pronounced *sè zhǔ*. *Lè* is pronounced *luò*. *Hào* is pronounced *hū bào*. *È* is pronounced *wū lù*. I fear that the future’s entanglements of life and death, gain and loss, sorrow and joy, love and hate will disturb my heart in this way. Could I ever again attain even a moment’s forgetfulness?\" {Note} Even one whose illness resembles the ultimate principle can be thus afflicted—how much more so one who embodies its extremity? {Explanation} Hazi, desiring to return to the true but finding no way, thus raged at his wife and son and drove away the Confucian scholar. The *Shiwen* notes: *fù* is pronounced *fú yòu*.\n\nZigong heard of this and found it strange, so he reported it to Confucius. Confucius said, \"This is not something within your grasp!\" Then, turning to Yan Hui, he instructed him to record it. {Note} This principle should indeed be within Zeng’s reach, but by suppressing it, he sought to bestow subtle appreciation upon a greater worthy. {Explanation} Zigong was a scholar of eloquent learning, one who advanced through diligent study, hence the words, \"This is not something within your grasp.\" Yan Hui, who loved learning and was second only to the sages, never deviated from benevolence, so he was commanded to record it—to illuminate the Dao through a great worthy. The character *jì* in the *Zang* edition is written as *jì* (\"record\"), both being interchangeable. The *Shiwen* writes *miào dàng* as *miào shǎng*, noting: *dàng* is pronounced *dīng làng*, with one version reading *shǎng*.\n\nAmong the people of Qin, there was a man of the Feng clan who had a son. The *Shiwen* notes: *Féng* is pronounced *páng*. In his youth, he was perceptive. Lu Bujun notes: The *Taiping Yulan* (49) writes *huì* (\"perceptive\") as *huì* (\"wise\"). The *Book of Later Han*, in the biography of Kong Rong, states: \"Will he not soon be wise?\" The commentary notes that *huì* is interchangeable with *huì* (\"wise\"). The *Shiwen* notes: *shào* is pronounced *shī zhào*. But upon reaching adulthood, he developed an illness of delusion and confusion. {Note} Perceptiveness is not delusion, yet the flaw of relying on it must lead to delusion. The *Shiwen* notes: *wǎng* is pronounced *wén liǎng*.\n\nHe mistook singing for weeping, saw white as black, smelled fragrance as rotten, {Note} The *Monthly Ordinances* states: \"Its odor is rotten.\" Qian Daxin said: The ancients paired fragrance with rottenness, taking their opposition, just as flavors have sweet and bitter. The *Monthly Ordinances* states: \"Spring’s odor is rank, summer’s is scorched, the center’s is fragrant, autumn’s is fishy, and winter’s is rotten.\" He tasted sweetness as bitterness. The *Shide Tang* edition writes *cháng* (\"often\") as *cháng* (\"taste\"). Yu Yue said: *Cháng* and *cháng* were interchangeable in antiquity. The *Liji*, in the \"Shaoyi\" chapter, states: \"Horses are not *cháng* fed,\" and the *Shiwen* notes: \"*Cháng* is written as *cháng* in one version.\" The *Erya*, in the \"Shigu\" section, states: \"*Cháng* means sacrifice,\" and the *Shiwen* notes: \"The character *cháng* is also written as *cháng*,\" both serving as evidence. The original text of the *Liezi* borrowed *cháng* for *cháng*. The *Daozang* edition replaced it with the original character, but this deviates from the ancient text’s usage. His actions were not what he deemed correct: wherever his intentions turned—heaven and earth, the four directions, water and fire, cold and heat—nothing was not inverted.\n\n{Explanation} Those who pride themselves on petty wisdom are deemed perceptive by others; those who embody the Dao and preserve harmony are deemed foolish. One who equalizes sound and color, forgets water and fire, is beyond the discernment of common people, hence they regard the Dao as delusion and confusion.\n\nYangshi told his father, \"The gentlemen of Lu possess many arts and skills. Might they be able to cure him? Why not seek their help?\" His father went to Lu, passing through Chen. The *Shiwen* notes: *guò* is pronounced *gē*. There, he encountered Lao Dan and recounted his son’s condition. Lao Dan said, \"How do you know your son is deluded? Now, all the people in the world are confused about right and wrong, blinded by profit and harm. Those sharing the same affliction are many, so none awaken. Moreover, the delusion of one person is not enough to overturn a household; the delusion of one household is not enough to overturn a village; the delusion of one village is not enough to overturn a state; the delusion of one state is not enough to overturn the world. If the entire world is deluded, who could overturn it? Wang Chongmin said: The character *qīng* (\"overturn\") does not correspond with the preceding text, likely an error for *zhèng* (\"correct\"). Lao Dan’s words to the Feng clan meant that his son’s delusion was not an illness—today, all the world’s people are confused about right and wrong, blinded by profit and harm, which is the true illness. Only because those sharing the illness are many do they fail to recognize it as such. If the entire world were as deluded as your son, who would seek to correct it? This follows the preceding *qīng* (\"overturn\") in error. The subsequent text—\"Who could correct sorrow and joy, sound and color, odor and taste, right and wrong?\"—directly continues this idea. If written as *qīng* (\"overturn\"), it would not convey the meaning. The *Taiping Yulan* (490) correctly writes it as *zhèng* (\"correct\"), providing evidence.\n\nHad all the people in the world been of the same mind as your son—The *Shiwen* writes *xiàng* as *xiāng*, noting: *xiāng* is pronounced *xiàng*—you would be the one truly deluded. Who could correct sorrow and joy, sound and color, odor and taste, right and wrong? The *Shiwen* notes: *lè* is pronounced *luò*. Moreover, my words here are not necessarily free from delusion, let alone the gentlemen of Lu, those couriers of delusion. {Note} The gentlemen of Lu extolled benevolence and righteousness, clarifying right and wrong, hence they are called couriers of delusion. The *Shide Tang* edition omits the character *cǐ* (\"this\") before *yán* (\"words\"), while the *Taiping Yulan* (490) includes it. Wang Zhong said: *yóu* (\"courier\") and *yóu* (\"fault\") are interchangeable. Wang Chongmin said: The *Taiping Yulan* (490) writes *yóu* as *yóu*, likely altered by the compiler. Lu Bujun notes: *Yóu* and *yóu* were interchangeable in ancient script, as seen in Gu Yanwu’s *Rizhi Lu*, volume 27, under the *Erya* commentary entry.\n\nThe *Shiwen* notes: *yóu* is pronounced *yóu*. How could they resolve others’ delusions? The *Shiwen* notes: *yān* is pronounced *yúqián*. \"Cherishing your provisions is not as good as hastening home.\"\n\n{Note} *Róng* means to discard. This chapter clarifies that the principles of right and wrong cannot be entirely settled, for they are all formed by the majority overwhelming the few to create contention.\n\n{Exegesis} *Róng* means to discard. The world is full of vulgar scholars, while those who awaken to the Dao are few. The deluded many mock the solitary wise, reversing truth to call them deluded. Thus Laozi said: \"When inferior scholars hear the Dao, they laugh heartily at it. If they did not laugh, it would not be the Dao.\" Now, to expect the contentious scholars of Zhao to rectify right and wrong is to stray ever further from the Dao. The Confucians of Lu, so deeply lost in the Way of forgetting form and preserving spirit, are themselves the most deluded—how could they enlighten others’ delusions? You would do better to abandon your roadside provisions and return swiftly.\n\nQin Enfu said: The character *zhào* (\"Zhao\") in the exegesis is likely a miswriting of *qū* (\"to hasten\"). Mou Ting said: Xunzi’s *Discourse on Military Affairs* states, \"Carry three days’ provisions,\" with the annotation: \"*Yíng* means to bear a load.\" Zhuangzi’s *Opening the Trunk* says, \"*Yíngténg* and hasten,\" with the *Shiwen* gloss: \"*Yíng* means to wrap.\" The *Fangyan* states: \"*Yíng* means to carry on the shoulder.\" Thus *yíngténg* means to bind and carry. Liezi’s *róng* is a loan for *yíng*. Yu Yue said: Zhang Zhan and Lu Chongxuan both gloss *róng* as \"to discard,\" but their basis is unknown—this is likely incorrect. *Róng* stands in contrast to *shí* (\"substance\"); *róng* is like *huá* (\"flower\"). The *Erya*’s *Explanation of Plants* states: \"Trees are called *huá*, grasses are called *róng*. Those that bear fruit without flowering are called *xiù*; those that flower without bearing fruit are called *yīng*.\" Such is its meaning. In ancient diction, all that lacks substance is called *huá* (\"flowery\"). The *Book of Later Han*, in the commentary to the *Biography of Ma Rong*, states: \"*Huáyù* means empty reputation.\" If *huá* can mean \"empty,\" then *róng* may also mean \"empty.\" \"*Róng* your provisions\" means they are wasted, without practical use. The *Book of Han*, in the *Biography of Yang Xiong*, states: \"The Four Elders gathered *róng* on South Mountain.\" Yan Shigu commented: \"*Róng* means reputation.\" Since *róng* contrasts with *shí* (\"substance\"), it may also mean \"name.\" In the context of plants, *róng* and *shí* are paired; in human affairs, *míng* (\"name\") and *shí* (\"substance\") or *xū* (\"empty\") and *shí* (\"substance\") are paired. Its meaning is thus coherent. Wu Kaisheng said: *Róng* should be the same as *yíng*; *qì* (\"discard\") should be *qì* (variant form). Lu Bujun noted: Yu Yue’s explanation is overly circuitous; Mou Ting’s is closer to the mark.\n\nThe *Shiwen* notes: *chuán* is pronounced *shìyuán*. *Zhēng* is pronounced *zhèng*.\n\nA native of Yan was born in Yan but grew up in Chu. As he aged, he returned to his homeland. Passing through the state of Jin, his traveling companions deceived him. Pointing to a city wall, they said, \"This is the city of Yan.\" The man’s expression darkened with emotion. Pointing to a local altar, they said, \"This is your village’s altar.\" A note in *Leiyu* (ch. 34) reads: \"若\" is written as \"君\" here and below. Wang Chongmin observes: *Taiping Yulan* (ch. 558) includes a gloss after \"若\": \"若 means 'you.'\" The man sighed deeply. Pointing to a house, they said, \"This is your ancestors’ dwelling.\" He wept silently. Pointing to a mound, they said, \"This is your ancestors’ grave.\" The man could not restrain his sobs.\n\nHis companions burst into laughter, saying, \"I have just been tricking you. This is the state of Jin.\" Yu Yue comments: \"昔\" should be \"皆,\" a scribal error. Wang Chongmin notes: *Taiping Yulan* (ch. 558) writes \"昔\" as \"等.\" Lu Bujun observes: \"昔\" is acceptable as is; no emendation is needed. The man was overcome with shame.\n\nWhen he arrived in Yan, he truly saw the city and altars of the state of Yan, truly saw his ancestors’ house and grave—yet his sorrowful heart grew faint.\n\nThis chapter illustrates that emotions have their limits; once grief and joy have passed, what once moved one no longer stirs joy or sorrow.\n\nMan’s nature is fundamentally alike, but habits diverge—each follows what his emotions and customs find familiar. One born in Yan never leaves his roots; one raised in Chu grows accustomed to his surroundings. Returning to one’s origin yet failing to recognize it, the shallow-minded are easily deceived. If one is led by semblances and lured, the credulous will be misled. When they realize the truth is not as they believed, they forget their emotions and feel only shame. Even when they see the real, they still regard it as false—neither right nor wrong is clear to them, for they are confused by others’ influence.\n\nHow much more so with today’s gentlemen, who all falsely cling to the city and altars of Jin—how could they know the supreme Dao of nurturing the spirit and returning to the root?\n\n*Geng* (\"grew\") is written as *bian* (\"then\") in the Shide Hall edition. Wang Lai notes: In the commentary, the four characters *shi ren de zhi* (\"the shallow-minded are easily deceived\") should precede *suo gui yu ben* (\"returning to one’s origin\"), and *yan* (\"then\") should follow *shi* (\"recognize\").\n\nThe *Shiwen* notes: *Wei* (\"faint\") means \"slight\"; the variant *che* is an error.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Four: Zhongni**\n\nThe wise one knows without knowing, for when wisdom is forgotten, nothing is known; when wisdom is employed, nothing is accomplished. One who embodies the spirit and acts alone, who forgets emotions and follows principle, abides in stillness and illumines the mysterious.\n\nThis chapter speaks of those who realize the Dao of non-action and may thus act without limitation. The world sees only the traces of the sage but not the root he has realized. Learners merely grasp the beginning of transcending emotions but not their all-pervading function—both miss the mean.\n\nThe *Shiwen* writes *wang qing* (\"forgets emotions\") as *qu qing* (\"abandons emotions\"), noting: *Qu* is read as *qiulu*, with one variant reading *wang*.\n\nConfucius was at leisure when Zigong entered to attend him. Seeing his master’s worried expression, Zigong dared not ask. He went out and told Yan Hui, who took up his zither and sang. Confucius heard him and indeed summoned Hui in, asking, \"Why do you alone find joy?\"\n\nThe *Taiping Yulan* (ch. 468 and 469) includes the character *gan* (\"dare\") before *du* (\"alone\").\n\nHui replied, \"Why does the Master alone feel sorrow?\"\n\nHui did not speak of his desire to ask, but played the zither and sang to provoke his master’s words.\n\nThe note *xuan* (\"proclaim\") is written as *zhi* (\"purpose\") in the Zang edition.\n\nConfucius said, \"First, speak your own thoughts.\"\n\nHui said, \"I once heard from you, Master: ‘Find joy in Heaven and know fate, and thus have no sorrow.’ This is why I rejoice.\"\n\nHeaven is the portion of nature; fate is the reckoning of rise and fall.\n\nThe *Shiwen* notes: *fen* is pronounced *fu wen* cut, the same below.\n\nConfucius, his expression suddenly grave, paused for a moment. The *Shiwen* notes: *qiao* is pronounced *qi xiao* cut; *qiaoran* means a change of countenance for a brief time.\n\nHe said, \"Did I truly say such a thing?\"\n\nThe note explains: To clarify that these words were not fully realized, he thus displayed a doubtful and questioning expression. The Daozang edition of the note reads \"doubtful questioning\" as \"doubtful inquiry.\" The *Shiwen* records *shi* (\"lost\") as *jia*, noting: *jia* is pronounced *xia*, with one version reading *shi*. Ren Dachun states: *jia* is pronounced *xia*, thus it corresponds with *xia* (\"narrow\"). Judging by the context, it likely means your understanding is narrow and not yet expansive. The *Guanzi*’s \"Bayan\" chapter states: \"When the superior is narrow, the inferior is constrained.\" The note explains: \"When the superior is already narrow, the inferior is encompassed by it.\" The *Shiwen* for the *Zhouli*’s \"Sishi\" reads: \"broad and narrow\" as \"broad and constricted.\" The *Guangya* also states: \"*Jia*, *xia*, *ci*, *qiu*, *po*, *cu*—all mean near.\" Since *jia* shares the same gloss as *po* (\"urgent\") and *cu* (\"pressed\"), *jia* thus means \"narrow.\" The *Hou Hanshu*’s \"Juli\" chapter states: \"It is narrow from east to west and long from north to south.\" Li Xian’s note reads: \"*Jia* is pronounced *xia*,\" thus *yi jia* (\"understanding narrow\") means *yi xia* (\"understanding constricted\"). The *Shiwen* preserves the ancient character. This was merely my past teaching. Let me now correct it with my present words.\n\nHere is the translation:\n\n---\n\nThe note states: \"Words of the past arose in response to circumstances; what is now made clear exhausts their ultimate meaning. You merely know that delighting in Heaven and knowing fate brings no sorrow, yet you do not know the great sorrow in delighting in Heaven and knowing fate.\"\n\nThe note explains: \"To know nothing, to delight in nothing, to sorrow in nothing—this is called greatness.\"\n\nWang Chongmin observes: The *Taiping Yulan* (468) includes a *zhi* (之) before *you* (有).\n\nNow I tell you the truth: cultivate the self, accept poverty and success, recognize that going and coming are not of the self, and banish disorder from the mind’s reckonings. (The original text reads *zhi* (止, \"to stop\"), but the present version follows the *Zangben*, *Shidetang*, and *Qin* editions, emending it to *wang* (亡, \"to banish\"). The *Shiwen* notes: *wang* is pronounced *wang* (忘, \"to forget\"), and one edition reads *zhi* (止).) This is what you call delighting in Heaven and knowing fate without sorrow.\n\nThe note explains: \"This merely distinguishes the boundaries of inner and outer, discerns the realms of honor and disgrace—no more. How could it be a matter of being without preference or aversion?\"\n\nThe exposition states: \"To delight in Heaven and know fate without sorrow is the way of timely success, not the means to respond, act, and save the world.\"\n\nConfucius said: \"I once held these words, but now they differ from the past. Formerly, I cultivated the *Book of Songs* and *Book of Documents*, rectified rites and music—\" (The *Shiwen* notes: *nang* (曩) is pronounced *nang* (乃朗切). *Yue* (乐) is pronounced *yue* (岳), and the same applies below.) \"—intending to govern the world and leave a legacy for future generations.\"\n\nThe note explains: \"The *Book of Songs*, *Book of Documents*, rites, and music are instruments for governing the age. The sage employs them to remedy the ills of the time; if their use strays from the Dao, they are of no benefit to order.\"\n\nThe *Shiwen* notes: *yi* (遗) is pronounced *yi* (唯季切).\n\n\"It was not merely to cultivate the self and govern the state of Lu. The note explains: \"The sage’s wisdom encompasses all things, and his Dao saves the world. To secure the self and save a single state is no way to be a sage.\"\n\nYet the rulers and ministers of Lu daily lost their proper order, benevolence and righteousness further declined, and human nature grew ever more shallow. If this Dao could not prevail in a single state or in its own time, what of the world and future generations?\n\nThe note explains: \"The arts of governing the age truly require benevolence and righteousness. Once the age is ordered, the arts used to order it should be set aside. If, when all affairs are concluded, one clings to them without letting go, those who are moved by them will be few, while those who profit from them will be many. The beginning of decline and shallowness truly lies here. To observe the world through a single state, or future generations through the present—how different are the harms they bring? Only one who is perfectly adaptable and unobstructed can follow change as it suits, without clinging to one side.\"\n\nZhongfu said: \"What of the world and future generations?\" *Ru* (如, \"what of\") here means *ruhe* (如何, \"how\"). The omission of *he* (何) is particularly rare.\n\nBo Jun notes: Yu Shengwu’s *New Evidence on the Book of Changes* holds that *yi* (矣) here is the same as *yi* (以) in the *Book of Songs* (*Zhaonan*, \"Gathering White Milfoil\"): \"Where shall we gather white milfoil?\"\n\nThe *Shiwen* notes: *zhi* (治) is pronounced *zhi* (直吏切), and the same applies to *zhi luan* (治乱, \"order and disorder\"). *She* (舍) is pronounced *she* (舍). *He* (阂) is pronounced *ai* (碍).\n\n\"I first realized that the *Book of Songs*, *Book of Documents*, rites, and music could not save order and disorder, yet I did not know the way to reform them. This is the sorrow of those who delight in Heaven and know fate.\"\n\nThe note explains: \"Only by discarding the misuse of rites and music, not the use of rites and music themselves—for rites and music cannot be discarded—does one not know the way to reform them. Citing this as a sorrow lays the groundwork for the meaning below, hence these words come first.\"\n\nThe exposition states: \"It is not that the *Book of Songs*, *Book of Documents*, rites, and music are insufficient as methods for governing the world; rather, the theories of the age cannot be saved by the *Book of Songs*, *Book of Documents*, rites, and music. Yet to discard these methods would leave nothing as the foundation of rites. This is the profound sorrow of those with the Dao.\"\n\nBo Jun notes: The *Taiping Yulan* (468) includes a *ye* (也) after \"This is the sorrow of those who delight in Heaven and know fate.\"\n\nThe *Shiwen* notes: *wei* (为) is pronounced *wei* (于伪切).\n\n\"Nevertheless, I have attained it. What is called delight and knowledge is not what the ancients meant by delight and knowledge.\"\n\nThe note explains: \"Zhuangzi said: 'To delight in poverty and success, things and the self—this is not the sage.' Thus, the ancients did not take the absence of delight as delight, nor the absence of knowledge as knowledge. To follow what one delights in is to naturally have no delight in principle; to follow what one knows is to naturally have no knowledge in principle.\" The characters *suo wei* (所谓, \"what is called\") are inverted as *wei suo* (谓所) in all editions; the present version follows the *Jifu* edition in correcting them.\n\nBo Jun further notes: The *Zhuangzi* (*Da Zongshi* chapter) states: \"Thus, when the sage employs troops, he may lose a state but not the people’s hearts; his beneficence extends to ten thousand generations, yet he does not do so out of love for people. Therefore, to delight in things and the self is not the sage.\" The note’s citation of \"delighting in poverty and success\" includes a *qiong* (穷, \"poverty\"), which is likely an interpolation.\n\n\"To have no delight and no knowledge—this is true delight and true knowledge.\"\n\nThe note explains: \"To be without any delight or any knowledge is to be able to delight in the world’s delights and know the world’s knowledge while remaining without intention.\"\n\nThus, there is nothing in which one does not delight, nothing one does not know, nothing one does not sorrow for, and nothing one does not do.\n\nThe note explains: \"Abiding in the fundamental and embodying completeness, one can act without acting and yet do all things.\"\n\n\"What is there to discard in the *Book of Songs*, *Book of Documents*, rites, and music? Why reform them?\"\n\nThe note explains: \"If one wishes to cast aside the *Book of Songs* and *Book of Documents* and change the methods of governance, how is this the way to remedy ills? To employ them without clinging, to act without reliance—things will be preserved of themselves.\"\n\nThe exposition states: \"To know what Heaven’s fate renders unavoidable and to accept one’s lot without sorrow—this is the constant heart of the noble person. But those of old who opened things and accomplished affairs, who aided people and benefited customs, were not so. They did not rest in their delight or entrust themselves to their knowledge. They preceded Heaven without opposing it, and followed Heaven while honoring its timing—this is true delight and true knowledge. Being thus, there is nothing they do not delight in, nothing they do not know, and thus they can do all things.\"\n\n\"Could one ever rely on such strategies? Thus, the *Songs* and *Book of Documents*, rites and music, are indeed the foundation for assisting transformation—why would one seek to change them?\n\nThe *Shiwen* notes: *Juan* is read as *yuan*. Yan Hui faced north, bowed with hands clasped, and said, 'I too have attained it.' The annotation states: This is what is meant by 'not opposing yet seeming foolish.'\n\nBo Jun notes: 'Bowed with hands clasped' is grammatically unsound. *Bai* should be written as □. □ is also written as □, and in the *Baihan Jian* as □. The characters for □ and *bai* are similar in form and thus mistaken. The *Shuowen* states: '□ means to raise the hands; a variant is □. Yang Xiong says *gong* is formed from two hands.' This is the modern character *gong*. The *Fei Gou* chapter of the *Xunzi* reads: 'The noble person examines the Way of the later kings and discusses it before the hundred kings of old, as if bowing in respect and deliberating.' Wang Niansun emends this, stating: '*Bai* is a corruption of *zhi*.' This serves as evidence.\n\nHe went out and told Zigong. Zigong was bewildered and lost, for he had not yet fully aligned with the ultimate words, and thus fell into confusion. Returning home, he indulged in thought for seven days without sleep or food, until his bones stood stark. The annotation states: He exerted himself in contemplation of the Dao, forgetting sleep and sustenance.\n\nYan Hui went again to enlighten him, whereupon Zigong returned to Master Qiu’s gate, playing the zither and reciting the texts, never ceasing for the rest of his life. The annotation states: Having awakened to the ultimate principle, he forgot all else.\n\nThe exposition states: Yan Hui, second only to the sage in the Dao, attained it without opposing what he heard. Zigong relied on the *Songs* and *Documents* for his wisdom, and thus, when words were spoken, he lost sight of their source. After Yan Hui enlightened him again, he awakened to the benefits of learning and the Dao of daily diminution.\n\nThe annotation's 'forgot' was written as 'perished' in the Northern Song edition; Wang’s edition followed this, but the present text follows the *Zang* edition and *Shi De Tang* edition in emending it.\n\nA minister of Chen paid a visit to Lu. The *Shiwen* notes: *Pin* is read as *pì zhèng*. He had a private audience with the house of Shusun. The *Shi De Tang* edition omits the character 'house' before 'said.' Shusun said, 'There is a sage in our state.' The minister asked, 'Is it not Kong Qiu?' 'It is,' he replied. 'How do you know he is a sage?' The annotation states: Profound is this question! The Dao of the sage transcends the bounds of common understanding, beyond the reach of all things; one sees only the traces of its convergence and calls him a sage. How could one truly know what makes him a sage?\n\nShusun said, 'I have often heard of him from Yan Hui.' The annotation states: Profound is this answer! Unless one embodies both aspects and manifests both forms, how could one speak of even a semblance or glimpse of what comes before and after? Even with Yan Hui’s capacity, he could not adequately describe it—how much less could those beneath him?\n\nThe *Shiwen* notes: *Fo* is read as *fāng wèi*; *liang* is read as *liàng*; *cheng* is read as *chǐ zhèng* below, the same.\n\nHe said, 'Kong Qiu can set aside the mind and employ the form.' The annotation states: These are Yan Hui’s words. The sage neither sets aside nor employs anything. The terms 'setting aside' and 'employing' arise only in response to circumstances. Thus, in attending to the myriad affairs, engaging with worldly matters—these are all matters of form and trace. As for the profound and absolute, the still and silent—these remain serene and unmoving.\n\nThe exposition states: The sage responds to things as they arise, aiding the times and serving their use, guiding the multitude of beings by manifesting traces, yet does not display the true to transform the common.\n\nThe *Shiwen* notes: *Bo* is read as *pò* below, the same.\n\nThe minister of Chen said, 'There is also a sage in our state—did you not know?' 'Who is this sage?' he asked. 'Among the disciples of Lao Dan, there is one named Kang Cangzi.' The annotation states: *Kang* is read as *gū láng*, also as *gēng*. The *Shiwen* notes: *Kang Cang* is read as *Gēng Sāng*; his name was Chu, and the *Records of the Historian* writes it as *Kang Cangzi*. Jia Kui’s *Xing Shi Ying Lan* states: In Wu Commandery, there is a family named Gengsang, regarded as a scholarly clan. Duan Yucai says: Jia Kui’s *Xing Shi Ying Lan* must be the *Xing Shi Ying Xian Pu* mentioned in the *Suishu Jing Ji Zhi*.\n\nThe annotation states: Even Lao Dan did not speak of attaining the Dao himself—how could Kang Cang have attained it? This is merely a borrowed name to illustrate that the ultimate principle is never severed from the principles of things.\n\n'He has attained Lao Dan’s Dao and can see with his ears and hear with his eyes.' The annotation states: The physical form is the dwelling of the mind and intelligence; the ears and eyes are the doors and windows of seeing and hearing. If the spirit is thoroughly permeating, then seeing and hearing do not depend on doors and windows, and illumination is not obstructed by walls.\n\nJiang Chaobo says: The *Miscellaneous Chapters* of the *Zhuangzi* reads: 'Among the followers of Lao Dan, there was one named Gengsang Chu, who had partially attained Lao Dan’s Dao and dwelt in the northern mountains of Weidie.'\n\nThe Lord of Lu heard this and was greatly astonished. The annotation states: He was not surprised by Confucius’s employment of form but by the interchangeability of ears and eyes. Since his traces were the same as those of other things, nothing startled him.\n\nHe sent a high minister with rich gifts to invite him. Wang Chongmin says: The *Yi Lin* quotes it as 'sent with the礼 of a high minister'; the *Quan Dao* chapter of the *Kang Cangzi* reads: 'Sent Shusun to return the visit and invite Kang Cangzi, treating him with the礼 of a high minister.' This aligns with the meaning of the *Yi Lin* quotation.\n\nBo Jun notes: The present two-volume *Kang Cangzi* was forged by Wang Shiyuan, a recluse of Xiangyang during the late Kaiyuan era of the Tang, as seen in the preface to the *Meng Haoran Ji* and the *Da Tang Xin Yu*.\n\nKang Cangzi accepted the invitation and arrived.\"\n\nThe annotation notes: One who is utterly without intent perceives no distinction between east and west as external to the self. The Duke of Lu humbly entreated him for instruction.\n\nKang Cangzi replied: \"Those who transmit such accounts speak falsely. *Shiwen Leiju Houji*, chapter nineteen, includes the character *ye* after *wang*. *Shiwen* glosses *chuan* as pronounced *zhuān*. I can see and hear without employing ears and eyes, but I cannot alter the function of ears and eyes.\"\n\nThe annotation explains: To alter the function of ears and eyes is not to render them entirely without use. If they were entirely without use, the instruments themselves would be discarded.\n\nThe exegesis states: Ears and eyes are the instruments of seeing and hearing; only spirit can employ them. If spirit is absent, even the ears and eyes of a dead man cannot see or hear. Kang Cangzi understood what man is capable of, and thus did not rely on ears and eyes as the masters of seeing and hearing. How could he command ears to see and eyes to hear? This is merely the ignorance of transmitters fabricating explanations.\n\nThe Duke of Lu said: \"This is most extraordinary. What is the nature of your Way? I remain eager to hear it.\"\n\nThe exegesis notes: The Duke of Lu still did not grasp this meaning, instead taking it as an augmentation of wonder, and thus persistently inquired about the Way.\n\nKang Cangzi said: \"My body harmonizes with mind—this is the non-opposition of form and wisdom. Mind harmonizes with qi—this is to further distance the use of form and wisdom, entrusting oneself to the tranquil qi. Qi harmonizes with spirit—this is to be still and unmoving, entirely forgetting wisdom. When wisdom is entirely forgotten, the principle of spirit operates alone, and there is no response it does not penetrate. Spirit harmonizes with nothingness.\"\n\nThe annotation explains: To be one with nothingness is to be spirit; to be one with spirit is to be nothingness. Do these two possess form? Only one who possesses wisdom cannot but draw near to nothingness to achieve communion; one who forgets the mind becomes one with nothingness.\n\nThe exegesis states: The body, having substance, becomes an obstruction; the mind, having attachments, becomes fixation. That the body harmonizes with mind does not lie in physical obstruction but in the fixation of boundaries. Thus, qi in relation to mind, though moving, is without fixation; therefore, that mind harmonizes with qi does not lie in fixation but in dynamic function. That qi harmonizes with spirit does not lie in movement but in clear perception. That spirit harmonizes with nothingness transcends the marvelous beyond form, thus it does not lie in clear perception but in profound union with the real.\n\nBo Jun notes: The *Zhuangzi*, \"Ren Jian Shi\" chapter, states: \"Unify your will; do not listen with the ears, but listen with the mind; do not listen with the mind, but listen with qi. The ears are limited to hearing (this sentence follows Yu Yue’s emendation), the mind is limited to correspondence. Qi is that which is empty and awaits things. Only the Dao gathers in emptiness. Emptiness is the alignment of the mind.\" This likely shares the same meaning. Regarding *jieran zhi you* and *weiran zhi yin*, Sun Yirang says: This passage pairs *you* with *yin*; *you* should likely be *xing*. Lu Chongxuan’s commentary reads, \"Thus there is form, there is sound, no far, no near,\" suggesting Lu’s text originally had *xing*. (*Kang Cangzi Quandao* also follows this passage with *you*.) *Shiwen* glosses *wei* as pronounced *guǐ*.\n\nThough distant in the eight wilds or near at the edge of one’s eyelashes—*Shiwen* glosses *jie* as pronounced *jiē*—whatever comes to engage me, I necessarily know it. The annotation explains: Only the vast openness of nothingness does not engage the sage’s thoughts. Where it touches the realm of differentiation, the illumination of spirit shines without distinction of far or near. *Shiwen* glosses *huo* as pronounced *huò*, and *fen* as pronounced *fèn*.\n\nYet I do not know whether it is my seven apertures and four limbs that perceive it, or my heart, belly, and six viscera that know it—*Shiwen* glosses *zang* as pronounced *cáng*. The five viscera are heart, lungs, liver, spleen, and kidneys. The six viscera include two kidneys: the left is the kidney, the right is the Gate of Life. The Gate of Life is where spirit resides. In men, it stores essence; in women, it connects to the womb. As it communicates with the kidneys, it is said there are six viscera. It is simply self-knowing.\n\nThe annotation explains: Where one’s destination is entirely forgotten, how could there be awareness of such attainment?\n\nThe exegesis states: Thus, whether form or sound, far or near, whatever comes to engage me, I know it all. Without employing the four limbs or seven apertures, it is like a bright mirror hung high, clearly illuminating itself. How could it rely on ears and eyes?\n\nThe Duke of Lu was greatly pleased.\n\nOne day, the Duke told this to Confucius, who smiled but did not answer.\n\n**Annotation:** Kang Cang’s words have exhausted the matter—what more could Confucius say? Yet in not answering, he answers, and so he expresses it with a smile.\n\n**Exegesis:** To express it with a smile is to grasp the purport of forgetting words.\n\nThe Chief Minister of Song—*Fayan Zhulin* (Vol. 20) reads \"Wu’s Chief Minister Pi,\" while *Guang Hongming Ji* (Vol. 1, *Gui Zheng Lun*), *Dui Fu Yi Fei Fo Seng Shi* (Vol. 11), *Fanyi Mingyi Ji*, *Shiwen Leiju* (Front Collection, Vol. 35), and *He Bi Shi Lei* (Front Collection, Vol. 48) all read \"Chief Minister Pi,\" though none are reliable. Lu Wenyu notes: The *Zang* edition reads \"Grand\" instead of \"Great,\" and the same below. Yang Bojun observes: *Han Feizi*’s *Shuo Lin* (Part 1) states, \"Ziyu met Confucius at the Chief Minister of Song’s residence.\" *Shuo Lin* (Part 2) says, \"The Grand Minister of Song was noble and decisive.\" *Nei Chu Shuo* (Part 1) mentions, \"Dai Huan was the Grand Minister of Song,\" and again, \"The Chief Minister of Song sent his young steward to the market.\" Gu Guangqi remarks: \"These all refer to the same person—Song’s Chief Minister, surnamed Dai and named Huan, a high minister of Song.\" The *Analects* (*Zihan* chapter) records: \"The Grand Minister asked Zigong, ‘Is your Master a sage? How is it that he is so versatile?’ Zigong replied, ‘Surely Heaven has endowed him to be a sage, and moreover, he is versatile.’ When the Master heard of this, he said, ‘The Grand Minister knows me! I was poor in my youth, so I acquired many humble skills. Does a noble man need so many? No, he does not.’\" This passage draws from that *Analects* exchange, casting the Grand Minister as the Chief Minister of Song and framing their dialogue. The *Shiwen* reads \"Chief Minister of Song,\" noting: *Da* is pronounced *tai*. Song was also called Shang, as its capital was Shangqiu, hence the two names. \"Grand Minister\" is an official title. Yang Bojun notes: Song was the successor of Shang, hence it was also called Shang. The *Zuozhuan* (Duke Xi, Year 22) states: \"The Chu people attacked Song to rescue Zheng. The Duke of Song prepared for battle, but the Grand Marshal firmly advised, ‘Heaven has long abandoned Shang—if you seek to revive it, you cannot be forgiven!’\" The *Zuozhuan* (Duke Ai, Year 9) also records: \"The historian Gui said, ‘This is called *Chen Yang*—it is auspicious for raising troops, favorable for attacking the Jiang, but inauspicious for Shang. Attacking Qi is permissible, but opposing Song is ill-omened.’\" This confirms the point. Though the state name Shang originally derived from a place name (as discussed in Wang Guowei’s *Guantang Jilin*), the *Shiwen*’s explanation is less precise.\n\nThe Chief Minister of Song asked, \"Is Qiu a sage?\"\nConfucius replied, \"If Qiu dares claim sagacity, how could he be a sage?\"\n\n**Annotation:** What the world calls sages is merely based on their traces—how could they know what makes one a sage or not? Thus, Qiu is merely learned and widely informed.\n\n**Annotation:** He appears learned and widely informed, but in truth, he has nothing to learn and nothing to know. The *Shiwen* reads \"appears\" as *shijian*, noting: *Jian* is pronounced *pian*.\n\nThe Chief Minister of Song asked, \"Were the Three Kings sages?\"\nConfucius replied, \"The Three Kings were adept at employing wisdom and courage—whether they were sages, Qiu does not know.\"\nThe character *fu* (\"not\") in all editions reads *bu* (\"no\"), but this follows the *Daozang* white-text edition and Lin Xiyi’s edition.\n\nHe asked, \"Were the Five Emperors sages?\"\nConfucius replied, \"The Five Emperors were adept at employing benevolence and righteousness—whether they were sages, Qiu does not know.\"\n\nHe asked, \"Were the Three Sovereigns sages?\"\nConfucius replied, \"The Three Sovereigns were adept at following the times—whether they were sages, Qiu does not know.\"\n\n**Annotation:** Confucius’s erudition, Tang and Wu’s martial prowess, Yao and Shun’s yielding, Fuxi and Shen Nong’s simplicity—these are all coarse traces of sages responding to their eras, not what makes them sages. What makes them sages is fundamentally beyond the reach of words and traces.\n\n**Exegesis:** To clarify that the great Dao is not a trace: what later generations expound are merely its traces. Thus, the Master, addressing what people commonly perceive, sought to illuminate the true sage.\n\nThe note \"Confucius\" in the *Shide Tang* edition reads \"Qiu.\" Wang Chongmin observes: The phrase \"adept at following the times\" is semantically incoherent. Likely, the original read \"The Three Sovereigns were adept at following the times,\" with the character *ren* (\"employing\") interpolated due to the preceding phrases \"The Three Kings were adept at employing wisdom and courage\" and \"The Five Emperors were adept at employing benevolence and righteousness.\" Wisdom and courage, benevolence and righteousness, can be \"employed,\" but following the times does not require \"employment.\" Both *Leiju* (Vol. 30) and *Taiping Yulan* (Vol. 401) omit the character *ren*. The *Shiwen* notes: *Pu* (\"simplicity\") is pronounced *pianjiao*.\n\nThe Chief Minister of Song was greatly astonished.\n\n**Annotation:** The world calls them sages, yet Confucius denies their sagacity—hence the Chief Minister’s astonishment.\n\nHe asked, \"Then who is a sage?\"\nYang Bojun notes: The character *zhe* (\"one who\") likely belongs after *sheng* (\"sage\"), originally reading \"who is a sage?\"\n\nConfucius’s expression shifted, and after a pause, he said, \"There are sages among the people of the West.\"\n\n**Annotation:** Is sagacity tied to a fixed place? I speak of it in such distant terms.\n\n\"There are sages who govern without disorder.\"\n\n**Annotation:** They do not govern by governing, so they cannot be disordered.\nYu Yue observes: The original text read \"govern without self-disorder.\" *Luan* (\"disorder\") means \"order\"—it signifies governing without governing. This aligns with the following phrases: \"speak without self-trust,\" \"transform without self-action.\" Later readers, not grasping *luan*’s meaning, altered it to \"without disorder,\" which is incorrect. Zhang’s annotation—\"They do not govern by governing, so they cannot be disordered\"—reflects the error in his base text.\n\nThe Lu edition is the same.\n\n**Explication of Pronunciation:** *Zhi* (\"govern\") is pronounced *zhílì*. The *zhi* below is the same.\n\n\"They speak without self-trust.\"\n\n**Annotation:** Those who speak are not trustworthy.\n\n\"They transform without self-action.\"\n\n**Annotation:** Those who act cannot transform. This is the ultimate perfection of non-action. \"Vast and boundless—people cannot name it.\"\n\n**Annotation:** He Yan’s *Discourse on the Nameless* states: \"To be praised by the people is to have a name; to lack praise is to be nameless. As for the sage, his name is nameless, his praise is unpraiseworthy. To call the nameless the Dao, and the unpraiseworthy great—then the nameless may be spoken of as having a name, and the unpraiseworthy as having praise. Yet how could they be the same in function as those that can be praised or named? This is like comparing them to nothingness, yet they possess all things. Within the realm of possession, they align with nothingness and differ from those that possess. Like attracts like, no matter how distant; unlike repels, no matter how near. It is like yin within yang, or yang within yin—each seeks its own kind. Summer is yang, yet its evenings and nights, far removed, share yin with winter; winter is yin, yet its mornings and days, far removed, share yang with summer. All differ from what is near yet align with what is distant. Only by examining these differences and similarities can the discourse on the nameless be understood. What brings one to this? The Dao is nothingness, possessing nothing. Since the beginning of heaven and earth, all things have possessed something; yet it is still called the Dao because it can once more employ nothingness. Thus, though dwelling in the realm of names, it effaces the form of the nameless; though residing in the distant body of yang, it forgets its own distant kindred in yin.\"\n\nXiahou Xuan said: \"Heaven and earth operate by nature; the sage employs nature. Nature is the Dao. The Dao is originally nameless, hence Laozi said, 'Forced to name it.' Confucius called Yao 'vast and boundless, beyond naming.' Below, he speaks of 'towering success,' which is a forced name, borrowing what the world knows to describe it. How could something with a name then be called 'beyond naming'? Only because it is nameless can it be named with all the names under heaven—yet is that truly its name? This is sufficient to illustrate, yet none comprehend it, like gazing at Mount Tai’s towering majesty and claiming the primal qi lacks vastness.\"\n\n**Note on the Shide Tang Edition:** \"Sufficient\" (*zú*) is written as \"this\" (*shì*); \"vastness\" (*máng*) as \"boundless\" (*máng*).\n\n**Explication of Pronunciation:** *Qiǎng* (\"forced\") is pronounced *qíliǎng*; *wéi* (\"to name\") as *yúwěi*; *biàn* (\"all\") is the same as *piàn*. *Jué* (\"towering\") is pronounced *jiānwù*; *máng* as *máng*.\n\n\"Qi [the Grand Steward] suspected him of being a sage. Did he not know whether he was truly a sage or truly not a sage?\"\n\n**Annotation:** The principle of sagacity is profoundly obscure, hence one can only suspect it.\n\nLiang Zhangju said: \"Praise of the Buddha likely begins here.\"\n\nThe Grand Steward Shang fell silent, pondering in his heart: \"Confucius has deceived me!\"\n\n**Annotation:** This is beyond the grasp of ordinary understanding, so he deemed it deception.\n\n**Explication:** Those who establish traces to exalt teachings, or clarify conduct to inspire transformation, are but worthy sages who save the world. As for one who embodies the great Dao—encompassing all like heaven and earth, transforming like the four seasons—without showing what can be governed yet cannot be disordered, without relying on words to be trusted, overflowing to benefit the myriad things, embracing all sentient beings with life, vast and unfathomable—this is the sage. To lodge him in a place and explain him with words is still insufficient; thus, one resorts to doubt and analogy to convey him. This is what the Grand Steward did not understand, taking it as the Master’s deceit.\n\n**Explication of Pronunciation:** *Mò* (\"silent\") is pronounced *mò*.\n\nZixia asked Confucius: \"What is Yan Hui’s character like?\"\nThe Master said: \"Hui’s benevolence surpasses my own.\"\n\n**Pei Jun’s Note:** In the *Shuo Yuan*’s \"Miscellaneous Sayings\" and the *Kongzi Jiayu* (Book 6), \"benevolence\" (*rén*) is written as \"trustworthiness\" (*xìn*).\n\n\"What is Zigong’s character like?\"\nThe Master said: \"Ci’s eloquence surpasses my own.\"\n\n**Pei Jun’s Note:** In the *Shuo Yuan*’s \"Miscellaneous Sayings\" and the *Kongzi Jiayu* (Book 6), \"eloquence\" (*biàn*) is written as \"quickness\" (*mǐn*).\n\n\"What is Zilu’s character like?\"\nThe Master said: \"You’s courage surpasses my own.\"\n\n\"What is Zizhang’s character like?\"\nThe Master said: \"Shi’s dignity surpasses my own.\"\n\n**Annotation:** That is, solemn dignity.\n\nZixia rose from his mat and asked: \"Then why do these four serve you?\"\nThe Master said: \"Sit! I will tell you.\"\n\nThe *Shiwen* notes: \"語\" is read as *yú jù* (鱼据切).\n\nHui could embody benevolence but could not be resolute.\n**Annotation:** *Fǎn* (反) means \"to change.\" One who clings to oneness without change, lacking the adaptable wisdom to respond to things, will inevitably encounter obstruction wherever they go.\n**Explanation:** One may journey with him along the Way, but not entrust him with discretion.\n\nYu Yue said: The character *fǎn* (反) lacks meaning here; it is likely a corruption of *rèn* (刃). In vulgar script, *rèn* (刃) is written as 刃, hence the error of rendering it as *fǎn* (反). *Rèn* (刃) and *rěn* (忍) are interchangeable. The *Mao Commentary* on the *Ode* \"Jiang Zhongzi\" states: \"the hardy and *rěn* (忍) tree,\" while the *Zheng Annotation* on the *Ode* \"Yi\" speaks of \"the pliant and *rěn* (忍) tree.\" The *Shiwen* further notes: \"*Rěn* (忍) was originally written as *rèn* (刃).\" This serves as evidence. \"Could embody benevolence but could not be *rèn* (刃)\" thus means \"could embody benevolence but could not be *rěn* (忍).\" This aligns perfectly with the subsequent text: \"Ci could be eloquent but could not be reticent; You could be courageous but could not be timid; Shi could be dignified but could not be accommodating.\" The *Huainanzi*'s \"Among Men\" chapter also records this matter, stating: \"Qiu could be benevolent and yet *rěn* (忍), eloquent and yet reticent, courageous and yet timid.\" Here, the character is correctly written as *rěn* (忍), providing clear proof. Zhang’s annotation, \"反 means 'to change,'\" shows that the text he relied upon was already corrupted. The Lu edition concurs.\n\n**Pei Jun’s Note:** Yu Yue’s argument is highly persuasive.\n\nIf so, then this \"忍\" (*rěn*) should be read in the same sense as in the *Zuozhuan*'s \"Duke Wen, Year One\": \"Moreover, this man has the eyes of a wasp and the voice of a jackal—he is a *rěn* (cruel) man,\" where *rěn* means \"cruel-hearted\" as used today. \"Ci could be eloquent but could not be reticent\" [*nè*]: [Explanation] He possessed the ability to advance but had not yet ascended to the Dao. **Pei Jun’s Note:** The *Shuo Yuan*'s \"Miscellaneous Sayings\" and *Kongzi Jiayu*'s \"Six Teachings\" both write *nè* (讷) as *qū* (屈). The *Shiwen* notes: *nè* is pronounced *núhū* (奴忽). \"You could be courageous but could not be timid\": [Explanation] He knew only the masculine but could not abide by the feminine. \"Shi could be dignified but could not be accommodating.\" [Annotation] To be eloquent yet unable to be reticent is to lack the substance of loyalty and trust; to be courageous yet unable to be timid is to harm the Dao of benevolence and forbearance; to be dignified yet unable to be accommodating is to violate the principle of harmonizing and concealing one’s brilliance—all of these are fixations on one aspect. [Explanation] To be self-guarded and austere yet unable to harmonize with others is to lose the virtue of harmony.\n\nXu Shidong says: In the *Analects*, \"Master Zeng said, 'How imposing Zhang is!'\"—this is what is meant by \"dignified\"; and \"It is difficult to join him in practicing benevolence\"—this is what is meant by \"unable to be accommodating.\"\n\n\"Even if I could exchange my Way for the combined virtues of the Four Masters, I would not consent.\" [Annotation] Each of the Four Masters embodies the extreme of a single practice; even if they were combined, to seek to exchange my Dao for theirs is not something I would permit. **Pei Jun’s Note:** This *yì* (易) should be understood as \"exchange,\" not \"transformation.\" Zhang’s annotation, interpreting it as \"transformation,\" is incorrect; Lu’s explanation as \"exchange\" is correct. The *Shiwen* notes: *xíng* (行) is pronounced *xiàmèng* (下孟).\n\n\"This is why they served me without divided loyalty.\" [Annotation] Gathering and uniting must be entrusted to the sage, and thus one cannot cease even if one wished to. [Explanation] Even if one possessed the combined virtues of benevolence, eloquence, dignity, and courage, I would still not exchange my Way for theirs—how much less so for those who cannot combine them? The Master could encompass what the Four Masters could not, and thus they served him without divided hearts. This discussion concerns the greatness of the Dao, which is further elaborated in the chapter on \"Concealment and Manifestation.\"\n\nThe *Shiwen* notes: *èr* (贰) means \"doubt\"; *yāo* (要) is pronounced *yīyáo* (一遥).\n\nAfter Master Liezi had studied under Master Hulu Zi Lin—[Annotation] a teacher who daily diminished [his attachments]—and befriended Bohun Maoren, the *Shiwen* notes: *mào* (瞀) is pronounced *mòhóu* (莫侯), he then resided in the southern outskirts. The *Shiwen* notes: One version writes \"反居\" (*fǎn jū*, \"returned to reside\") instead of \"乃居\" (*nǎi jū*, \"then resided\"). **Pei Jun’s Note:** The *Taiping Yulan* (406) correctly cites it as \"反.\"\n\nThose who followed him were so numerous that even daily reckoning could not keep pace. [Annotation] Visitors came in an unbroken stream; even if one tallied them day by day, one could not exhaust the count. Hu Huaichen says: \"日\" (*rì*, \"day\") is a corruption of \"百\" (*bǎi*, \"hundred\"). \"Hundreds tallied yet not exhausted\" means that those who followed Liezi were so numerous that none could match him. The *Huangdi* chapter states, \"The gulls that came numbered in the hundreds yet did not cease\" (*Lüshi Chunqiu* writes \"数\" [*shù*, \"count\"]), which shares the same structure and serves as evidence. Wang Shumin says: The *Chuxue Ji* (18) cites \"游\" (*yóu*, \"travel\") for \"处\" (*chǔ*, \"reside\") and \"百\" for \"日\"; the *Taiping Yulan* (404) also writes \"百\" for \"日.\" It is likely that \"百\" is the correct character. The *Shiwen* notes: *shù* (数) is pronounced *sèzhǔ* (色主); *liào* (料) is pronounced *liáo* (聊).\n\nNevertheless, Master Liezi was also somewhat obscure. [Annotation] Liezi himself did not know their number. Yu Yue says: *wēi* (微) means \"dim.\" The *Zhouyi*'s *Tuan* commentary on *Zhun* states, \"Heaven creates in the midst of dimness.\" The *Zhengyi* cites Dong Yu: \"*mèi* (昧) means subtle things.\" The *Xici* commentary states, \"To know the subtle and know the manifest.\" The *Wen Xuan*'s commentary on the *Western Capital Rhapsody* cites an old annotation: \"To know the subtle is to know the dim.\" Thus, *wēi* (微) and *mèi* (昧) share the same meaning. \"Master Liezi was also somewhat *wēi*\" is equivalent to saying \"Master Liezi was also somewhat *mèi*.\" Hence, Zhang’s annotation states, \"He himself did not know their number.\" Tao Hongqing says: *wēi* means \"subtle.\" The *Xunzi*'s \"Discourse on Warfare\" states, \"The feudal lords possess the ability to be subtle and refined in their regulations.\" Yang’s commentary: \"*wēimiào* (微妙) means utmost precision.\" This passage says that Liezi’s arts were subtle, which is why, though his disciples were many, he could daily engage with them in debate and be heard far and wide. Later in this chapter: \"Long Shu said to Wen Zhi, 'Your arts are subtle! I have an illness—can you cure it?'\" The *Tang Wen* chapter states, \"Master Xiang then clapped his chest, stamped his feet, and exclaimed, 'Your playing is subtle!'\" Both refer to the subtlety of the arts, which confirms the meaning of this passage. Zhang’s annotation, \"Liezi himself did not know their number,\" and Yu’s interpretation of *wēi* as *mèi* are both incorrect.\n\nDay after day, they debated without ceasing, and nothing went unheard. [Annotation] Master and disciples engaged in teaching and practice, their voices carrying far and wide. [Explanation] Since his followers were so numerous that Liezi could not tally them, he daily discoursed on the traces of the sages, and nothing went unheard.\n\nYet for twenty years, he and Master Nanguo lived as neighbors, sharing a wall, without ever visiting or sending inquiries. [Annotation] Their Ways were profoundly aligned, and thus, even in old age, they did not exchange visits. When they encountered each other on the road, their eyes seemed not to see. [Annotation] When the Dao is present, sight is abandoned.\n\nHis disciples and followers suspected that Master Liezi and Master Nanguo were enemies. [Annotation] *dí* (敌) means \"enemy.\" [Explanation] The crowd suspected enmity, seeing that they did not exchange visits. **Pei Jun’s Note:** Later in the text, \"Among the disciples of Puze there was one named Bo Fengzi,\" the annotation states: \"*yì* (役) means 'disciple.'\" The *Zhuangzi*'s \"Gengsang Chu\" chapter states, \"Laozi had a disciple named Gengsang Chu,\" and the *Shiwen* cites Sima: \"*yì* (役) means 'student disciple.'\" Hence, \"disciples and followers\" are mentioned together.\n\nThere came one from Chu who asked Master Liezi, \"What enmity exists between you and Master Nanguo?\"\n\nMaster Liezi replied, \"Master Nanguo’s appearance is full yet his mind is empty; his ears do not hear, his eyes do not see, his mouth does not speak, his mind does not know, and his form is without change. **Tao Hongqing’s Note:** The character *tì* (惕) should be *□*. The *Shuowen* states: '*□* means intertwined.' It is the original character in the *Yijing*. 'Form without *□*' means his form does not alter. The following text states, 'Upon seeing Master Nanguo, he indeed appeared as if a disembodied spirit, impossible to engage. Turning to look at Master Liezi, his form and spirit were not in accord, impossible to join.' This confirms that his form does not alter. Later generations have seen *yì* (易) often but *□* rarely, thus mistakenly writing *tì* (惕).' **Annotation on the Text:** *Tì* is pronounced *tā lì*. What shall we do when we go?\n\n**[Annotation]** *Chōng* (充) means \"complete.\" When the mind is empty, the form is whole; thus, the ears are not confused by sounds, the eyes are not hindered by sights, the mouth does not choose its words, and the mind does not employ knowledge. Inner and outer merge as one, so the form does not tremble.\n\n**[Explanation]** His appearance is whole and his mind is perfect, never engaging in the distinctions of ears, eyes, mouth, or mind. Thus, his mind has no use for knowledge, and his form has no cause for anxiety or change. **Note:** The character *wéi* (为) appears as *yān* (焉) in Wang’s edition; here, it is corrected according to other versions.\n\n\"Nevertheless, come with me and let us go together.\"\n\nThey reviewed forty disciples to accompany them.\n\n**[Annotation]** Was this journey to distinguish the excellent from the inferior or to calculate the long from the short? The number was forty, so it is recorded directly as such.\n\n**[Pronunciation Note]** *Yuè* (阅) is pronounced *yuè*.\n\nThey saw Nan Guozi, who indeed resembled a *qīpò*—utterly unapproachable.\n\n**[Annotation]** *Qīpò* refers to a clay figurine. Another interpretation reads *qī* [missing character]. With spirit congealed and form dissolved, external things could not perceive him.\n\n**[Note]** The character *□* originally appeared as *tóu* (头, \"head\"); it is corrected here according to the *Shidetang* edition.\n\nRen Dachun states: The original text reads, \"Nan Guozi’s appearance resembled a *qīpò*,\" and Zhang Zhan’s annotation says, \"*Qīpò* is a clay figurine.\" This likely refers to a figure made of clay adorned with a human face—what is called a *□tóu*. Jiang Chaobo argues: \"*Qīpò* should be *qīchǒu* (□丑), a corruption of the character.\" The *Huainanzi*’s *Jingshen Xun* states, \"Gazing upon the most exalted and favored is like observing a passing traveler; beholding Mao Qiang or Xi Shi is like seeing a *qīchǒu*,\" with Gao You’s annotation: \"*Qīchǒu* means extreme ugliness.\" Zhang Zhan’s annotation is incorrect.\n\nWang Chongmin says: Ren’s interpretation is mistaken.\n\nThough *qī□* shares a single graph, \"*qīpò*\" and \"*□tóu*\" are not the same thing. *Qīpò* is used to pray for rain, while *□tóu* is used to drive away plague. *□tóu* is so named for its hideous appearance, whereas *qīpò* is simply a clay figurine. Here, describing Nan Guozi as resembling a *qīpò* serves to illustrate the depth of his attainment of the Dao—what is meant by \"a form like withered wood, a mind like dead ashes.\" Zhang’s annotation further cites an alternative interpretation: \"*Qī□* refers to a spirit whose form is so concentrated that external things cannot perceive it.\" This aligns with the intended meaning.\n\nBo Jun notes: Wang’s interpretation is correct.\nThe *Shiwen* states: *Pò* is pronounced *piàn’gè*. Dictionaries write it as *qī□*, meaning \"a human face of extreme ugliness.\" *□* is pronounced *piàn’gè*. *Sàng* is pronounced *xīlàng*. Qin Enfu says: The *Shiwen* writes it as *qī*, but this is a scribal error—it should be *□*. The *Shuowen Jiezi* states: \"[*□*] means 'ugly.'\" In the *Guangyun*, *□* is pronounced *pǐ’gè*. Its sound is close to *pò*, making them interchangeable loan characters.\n\nRen Dachun states: The *qī* in *qīpò* takes *□* as its original graph. The *Shuowen* says: \"*□* means 'ugly,' from *yè* (page) with *qí* as phonetic. Today, in plague-expelling rituals, there is the *□tóu*.\" The *Yupian* and *Guangyun* concur. It is also written as *魌 (qī)*—the *Zhouli*’s *Fangxiangshi* commentary says: \"It is like the *qītóu* of today.\" It is also written as *倛 (qī)*—the *Xunzi*’s *Feixiang* chapter says: \"Confucius’ face resembled a *méngqī*.\" Yang Liang’s annotation: \"It refers to the *fangxiang*.\" It is also written as *□*—the *Yupian* states: \"*□* is the same as *□*.\" All share the same pronunciation as *qī*, hence this text also writes it as *qī*.\n\nGazing upon Master Liezi, his form and spirit seemed mismatched, such that he could not mingle with others.\n**[Annotation]** This describes a spirit that commands the body.\nA mind without thought shows no movement in the countenance; thus, they appear uncoordinated, and how could external things engage with them?\n**[Exegesis]** When his disciple Yuejian went to visit him, Nan Guozi indeed resembled a *qīpò*—like the *qītóu* of today—such that his form and spirit were inaccessible.\n\nSuddenly, Nan Guozi pointed to one of Liezi’s disciples in the back row and spoke to him.\n**[Annotation]** He happened to be in the back row, without regard for rank or status. Responding to stimuli without intention toward things.\n**[Shiwen]** *Háng* is pronounced *hùláng*.\n\nThe disciple was *kànkàn*-like, as if single-minded and domineering.\n**[Annotation]** One who has attained the ultimate principle speaks no words. When words arise, distinctions between self and other emerge. The sage engages with the world through humble deference, aligning with things. Thus, to an observer, he may seem to seek truth and strive for superiority.\n**[Exegesis]** The disciple in the back row had not yet forgotten concerns of right and wrong. His *kànkàn* manner was merely the air of one seeking to prevail.\n\nYu Yue states: The *Shiwen* notes, \"In one version, *zài* (在) is written as *cún* (存).\" This should be followed. The *Zhuangzi*’s *Tianxia* chapter says: \"Shi Cunxiong had no method.\" This also contains the phrase *cúnxióng*, providing evidence.\n**[Shiwen]** *Kàn* is pronounced *kǒuhàn*. *Zàixióng* in one version is written as *cúnxióng*.\n\nLiezi’s disciples were astonished.\n\n**[Annotation]** Observing his corpse-like stillness, they saw him as no different from wood or earth; witnessing his engagement with things, they perceived him as if clinging to right and wrong—hence their astonishment.\n**[Shiwen]** *Hài* (駴) is written as *hài* (骇), noting: \"駴 and 骇 are the same.\"\nReturning to their lodgings, all bore expressions of doubt.\n\n**[Annotation]** He sought to elicit Master Liezi’s words.\n**[Exegesis]** They suspected he had not yet relinquished the mind of victory and defeat.\n\nMaster Liezi said: \"The one who attains the meaning speaks no words; the one who advances in knowledge also speaks no words.\n**[Annotation]** Having exhausted the principle and embodied its ultimate, both words and meaning are forgotten.\n**[Shiwen]** *Jìn* is pronounced *jìn*.\n\nTo employ no-words as words is still to speak; to employ no-knowledge as knowledge is still to know.\n**[Annotation]** Just as one seeks to abolish words through no-words and dispel knowledge through no-knowledge, those who revere rare speech and follow secondary teachings remain inevitably bound to words and knowledge.\n\nNo-words yet not-words, no-knowledge yet not-knowledge—these are still words, still knowledge.\n**[Annotation]** By comparison, even those who strive to preserve the natural and abide in the realm of no-words and no-knowledge are but attempting to dispel what cannot be dispelled, to know what cannot be known.\nOne who attempts to dispel what cannot be dispelled has not yet departed from dispelling; one who claims to know what cannot be known—when has he ever forgotten knowledge? This is assuredly not the natural forgetting of words and knowledge.\n**[Annotation]** \"Has not yet departed from dispelling\": The *Wang* edition writes *bù* (不) for *wèi* (未); here corrected according to the Northern Song edition and the *Zang* edition.\nYu Yue states: *Yǔ* (与) means *wéi* (为). Above it says, \"To employ no-words as words is still to speak; to employ no-knowledge as knowledge is still to know\"; thus here it says, \"No-words as not-words, no-knowledge as not-knowledge—still words, still knowledge.\" This builds upon the preceding passage to advance a further meaning. The earlier passage uses *wéi* (为), while this uses *yǔ* (与), differing in wording but not in sense—such variations are common in ancient texts. The *Guanzi*’s *Jie* chapter states: \"Even from my concubine’s body, I do not *wéi* (为) others to hold or meet.\" Yin Zhichang’s commentary says, \"*Wéi* is like *yǔ*,\" hence *yǔ* is also like *wéi*. For further discussion, see Wang’s *Jingzhuan Shici*.\n**[Shiwen]** *Lí* is pronounced *lìzhì*.\n\nYet there is nothing not spoken, nothing not known; yet there is nothing spoken, nothing known.\n**[Annotation]** Now, no-words are the source of words; no-knowledge is the master of knowledge. The mind of the perfected person is vast and empty, responding to things with words yet not his own words; knowing through things yet not his own knowledge. Thus, though he speaks all day, he bears no reputation for profound silence; though he employs knowledge all day, he bears no name of toiling thought. Therefore, he attains nothing not spoken, nothing not known.\n**[Shiwen]** *Chēng* is pronounced *chǐzhèng*.\n\nSuch is the case, and nothing more. Why this groundless astonishment?\"\n\n**[Annotation]** Those who fail to comprehend where the most wondrous converges grow coarser still; those who attain the loftiest heights find themselves descending instead. Then, marveling at the strange countenance of responsive stillness or the unusual bearing of movement and rest—how could this not be groundless astonishment?\n\n**[Exegesis]** Supreme knowledge and intent both forget words. If there were distinctions of superiority or inferiority, one would need words to guide them. Yet what difference is there between wordless words and knowing without knowledge? Nevertheless, where the Dao is concerned, one ought to discern this: there has never been speech, yet never an absence of speech; never knowledge, yet never an absence of knowledge. The principle is precisely thus—why this baseless wonder?\n\nMaster Liezi studied—\n**[Annotation]** The preceding chapter states, \"Liezi studied the Dao of riding the wind.\"\n**[Bo Jun’s Note]** There is likely a missing \"之\" before \"学.\"\n\n—three years later, his mind dared not entertain judgments of right and wrong, his mouth dared not speak of profit and harm. Only then did Old Shang deign to glance at him askance.\n**[Shiwen]** *Miǎn* is pronounced as \"squinting sideways.\"\n\nFive years later, his mind once more pondered right and wrong, his mouth once more spoke of profit and harm. Only then did Old Shang begin to relax his features and smile.\n\nSeven years later, he followed his mind’s every thought—\n**[Shiwen]** *Cóng* is pronounced *zòng.*\n\n—yet no right or wrong remained; he followed his mouth’s every word, yet no profit or harm remained.\n\nMaster Liezi was first drawn by his teacher to sit beside him on the same mat.\n**[Annotation]** His sidelong glance, his smile, and their shared seat seemed to convey subtle shifts of praise or censure, elevation or demotion.\n\nYet the heart of the sage responds to circumstances and is moved, measuring itself by the weight of external things—how could it be fixed to one direction alone?\n**[Wang Chongmin’s Note]** The character \"吾\" is likely superfluous. This passage also appears in the *Huangdi* chapter. There, it is Liezi’s words to Yin Sheng, so the \"吾\" is appropriate. Here, however, the narrative is in the author’s voice, and the inclusion of \"吾\" renders it incoherent.\n\nNine years later, his mind roamed freely in thought,\n**[Shiwen]** *Heng* is pronounced with a falling tone.\nhis mouth spoke without restraint—yet he no longer knew whether these were his own judgments of right and wrong, profit and harm, or another’s. Inner and outer had merged.\n**[Shiwen]** *Jin* is pronounced *jin.*\n\nOnly then did his eyes become like ears, his ears like nose, his nose like mouth—all alike, with no distinction.\n**[Lu Wenchang’s Note]** The second \"mouth\" is redundant. The earlier scroll includes an \"也\" after \"无不同,\" which should be followed.\n**[Wang Shumin’s Note]** Lu’s observation is correct. The *Huangdi* chapter does not repeat the \"口\" character.\n\nHis mind congealed, his form dissolved; flesh and bone fused as one. He no longer sensed where his body leaned, where his feet trod, what his mind pondered, or where his words resided. Thus it was—nothing of principle remained hidden.\n**[Annotation]** This passage appears in the *Huangdi* chapter, where it is explained in detail. Its repetition here serves a purpose: first, it clarifies the ultimate attainment of inherent nature, enabling one to ride transformation without end; later, it elucidates the principle of following the heart, illuminating even the most obscure depths. The two chapters appear in tandem, each with its own intent—how could one fail to discern this?\n\n**[Exegesis]** Laozi said, *\"Great wisdom seems foolish; great eloquence seems inarticulate.\"* People only recognize the distinction between knowing and speaking, unaware that not knowing and not speaking are the same. Thus, the *Huangdi* chapter demonstrates the use of wordless speech to aid others, while this chapter revisits the topic of speech, showing that the use of words is no different from their absence.\n**[Annotation]** The character \"则\" appears as \"明\" in the *Cang* edition; \"攸趣\" is \"攸极\" in the Northern Song edition, followed by the Wang edition. Here, the *Cang* and *Shidetang* editions are adopted for correction.\n**[Shiwen]** *Chong* is pronounced *zhuyong.*\n\nEarly on, Liezi delighted in wandering.\n**[Shiwen]** *Hao* is pronounced *hubaò* (falling tone), as below.\n\nMaster Huqiu asked, \"You, Gou, delight in wandering—what is it you love about wandering?\"\nLiezi replied, \"The joy of wandering lies in the ever-new play of things.\n**[Annotation]** What one encounters is always fresh.\n**[Shiwen]** *Le* is pronounced *luò.*\n\nOthers wander to observe what they see; I wander to observe what transforms.\n**[Annotation]** \"Others\" refers to the common and petty, who only perceive the contrasts of glory and decay, taking them as fortune or misfortune, unaware that they move with the flux of change, which never pauses for even a moment.\n**[Variant]** The *Shidetang* edition reads \"观之所变.\"\n**[Annotation]** \"惟观\" appears as \"惟睹\" in the *Cang* and *Shidetang* editions.\n**[Yu Yue’s Note]** \"之\" is equivalent to \"其.\" In the *Lüshi Chunqiu* (*Yinchu* chapter), it states, *\"之子是必大吉,\"* where Gao You glosses \"之\" as \"其.\" In the *Mencius* (*Gongsun Chou* chapter), it reads, *\"皆悦而愿为之氓矣,\"* and the *Zhouli* (*Zaishi* commentary) quotes it as *\"皆悦而愿为其民矣,\"* showing that \"之\" and \"其\" share the same meaning. Above, it says *\"观其所见,\"* and below, *\"观之所变,\"*—the wording differs, but the meaning is the same. Such examples abound in ancient texts. The variant reading \"其\" likely arises from a failure to grasp this classical usage.\n\nThe *Shiwen* notes: \"悴 is pronounced as *jízuì*.\"\n\n\"Wandering, ah, wandering! Yet none can discern this wandering.\"\n\n**[Annotation]** Though people wander with Liezi as one, the manner of their wandering differs—hence the exclamation, \"Wandering, ah, wandering!\" This clarifies the distinction between the two perspectives. None have yet distinguished between them, for those who understand are few.\n\n**[Exegesis]** The transformations of things are ceaseless, ever-shifting without constancy. Others merely delight in what they perceive, while I observe their transformations—this is how I differ from them.\n\n**[Variant]** \"辨\" appears as \"辩\" in the *Cang* edition.\nThe *Shiwen* notes: \"鲜 is pronounced as *xīqiǎn*.\"\n\nMaster Huqiu said: \"Does Youkou’s wandering truly align with others’, or does he claim it fundamentally differs? For all that is seen, one invariably perceives its changes.\"\n\n**[Annotation]** If there is no momentary pause, then what is seen now is never what was seen before. Thus, whether observing what is seen or observing what changes, there is no basis for distinction. Those who indulge in the impermanence of external things fail to recognize their own impermanence.\n\n**[Annotation]** Both the external and the self flow away with the transformations. Those who pursue outward wandering do not know to turn inward in observation.\n\n**[Bo Jun’s Note]** \"Outward wandering\" and \"inward observation\" stand in contrast, implying that observation is also a form of wandering. The *Mencius* (*King Hui of Liang* chapter) states: *\"What must I cultivate to compare with the observations of the former kings?\"* Zhao Qi’s commentary reads: *\"What cultivation would allow one to compare with the former kings’ wandering and observation?\"*—using \"wandering\" to gloss \"observation.\" The *Lüshi Chunqiu* (*Jichun* chapter) says: *\"Forbid women from observing,\"* and Gao You’s annotation explains: *\"Observation means wandering.\"* These are all evidence of this usage.\nThe *Shiwen* notes: \"不知 appears as 不如 in one edition. 观 is pronounced as *guàn*. 谛 means *examination*.\"\n\nThose who wander outwardly seek completeness in things; those who observe inwardly find sufficiency within themselves. To find sufficiency within oneself is the perfection of wandering; to seek completeness in things is its failure.\n\n**[Annotation]** Though man possesses a seven-foot form, the principles of Heaven and Earth are fully contained within. Thus, the head is round and the feet square, mirroring the Two Modes; the nose protrudes and the mouth is recessed, resembling mountains and valleys. Flesh and skin connect like soil and earth, blood and vessels link like rivers and streams; warmth and steam resemble scorching fire, breath and qi differ not from wind and clouds. Inwardly observing these myriad forms, not a single thing is lacking—why must one gaze upward and downward, tread through court and countryside, before their perceptions are complete?\n\n**[Exegesis]**\nYou deem yourself different from others, yet what others perceive differs not from what you perceive. Why so? You know things and their transformations, yet know not that you yourself remain unchanged. Merely wandering outward without inward observation—though moved by things, you lose yourself—this is the utmost extreme. Why then seek completeness in external wandering?\n\n**[Annotation]** The *Lüling* and *Shidetang* editions read “tread through” for “tread and ascend.” Wang Lai notes: In the exegesis, the phrase “know things” is repeated; above “utmost” a “not” should be added. The *Explication of Script and Phonology* reads: *wā* (recessed) as *wūguā*; *zhēng* (steaming) as *zhèng*.\n\nThereupon Liezi never ventured forth for the rest of his life, deeming himself ignorant of wandering.\n\n**[Annotation]**\nHaving heard the ultimate discourse, he abandoned his wanderings and observations. “Never ventured forth” does not mean secluding himself within doors and courtyards. The *Explication of Script and Phonology* reads: *nì* (conceal) as *nìlì*.\n\nHuqiuzi said: “Is this not the perfection of wandering!”\n\n**[Annotation]**\nEarlier, he questioned Liezi’s discourse on wandering, yet had not discussed wandering to its perfection—hence this reiteration. The *Explication of Script and Phonology* reads: *nàn* (question) as *nǎidàn*; *chóng* (reiterate) as *zhùyòng*.\n\nThe perfect wandering knows not where it goes; the perfect observation knows not what it sees.\n\n**[Annotation]**\nSufficient within himself, he knows not where he goes; turning his gaze inward, he knows not what he sees. All things wander, all things observe.\n\n**[Annotation]**\nForgetting wandering, he thus encounters things and wanders; forgetting observation, he thus encounters things and observes. This is what I call wandering, this is what I call observation.\n\n**[Annotation]**\nWhat I affirm is, in truth, the affirmation of nothing. Wherever he goes, he remains unobstructed and without fixation—this is what I call wandering and observation. Thus it is said: “Is this not the perfection of wandering! The perfection of wandering!”\n\n**[Exegesis]**\nWhen the form goes nowhere and the eye fixes on nothing, then nothing is not seen and nothing is not wandered. Such wandering and observation—truly the perfection of wandering!\n\nLong Shu said to Wen Zhi: The *Explication of Script and Phonology* reads: *Zhì* as *zhì*. Wen Zhi, a man of the Warring States period, once treated King Wei of Qi. Some say: a skilled physician of Song during the Spring and Autumn period, who cured King Wen of Qi by provoking his anger.\n\n“Your art is subtle indeed. I suffer from an affliction—can you cure it?”\n\nWen Zhi replied: “As you command. Yet first, tell me the symptoms of your affliction.”\n\n**[Exegesis]**\nWhat Wen Zhi healed were but ailments of the viscera, bones, and flesh. What Long Shu spoke of was the heart that forgets form and transcends the vulgar—distinct from the common herd, he deemed it an affliction.\n\nLong Shu said: “I do not take praise from my village as honor, nor censure from the state as disgrace; gain brings me no joy, loss no sorrow; I regard life as death.”\n\nSeeing wealth as poverty;\nseeing others as swine—\n**[Annotation]** With equanimity in all directions, one regards the myriad things as devoid of preference or distinction, of nobility or baseness.\nSeeing myself as another—\n**[Annotation]** Forgetting self and other.\n\nDwelling in my household as in a wayside inn—\n**[Annotation]** Not possessing one’s home.\nViewing my homeland as a land of barbarians—\n**[Annotation]** The world as one.\n\nAll these manifold afflictions—\n**[Textual Note]** The Northern Song edition reads “multitudes” (*shù*) instead of “afflictions” (*jí*); Wang’s edition follows it. Here, we adopt the reading from the *Zang* edition, the *Shide Tang* edition, and the Qin edition to emend.\n**[Exegesis]** The *Exegesis and Phonology* notes: “All these manifold afflictions” was once rendered as “all these multitudes,” which is incorrect.\n\nNeither rank nor reward can incentivize,\nnor punishment nor threat coerce;\nprosperity or decline, profit or harm cannot alter,\ngrief or joy cannot sway.\n\nThus, one cannot serve a lord,\nassociate with kin or friends,\ngovern wife and children,\nor command servants and slaves.\n**[Annotation]** What binds a person to external things is the heart’s attachment to beauty and aversion, the body’s sensitivity to benefit and harm. If one can unify the ten thousand differences into a single thread, how could one perceive any distinction between existence and non-existence? Therefore, even the Son of Heaven cannot make such a one his subject, the feudal lords cannot make him their friend, wives and children cannot claim his intimacy, and servants and slaves cannot grow familiar with him.\n\nTao Hongqing says: *gù* should be read as “thus.”\nYang Bojun notes: In the annotation, “the Son of Heaven cannot make such a one his subject,” the word *suǒ* (“that which”) appears to be superfluous. The *Four Exegeses* edition reads: “the feudal lords cannot make him their friend, wives and children cannot claim his intimacy, servants and slaves cannot grow familiar with him,” and the *suǒ* in each case seems to have been added later.\n\nWhat affliction is this?\nWith what method could it be cured?\n\n[Solution]\n\nZhuangzi says: “Praise does not spur him on, slander does not dishearten him; he has settled the distinction between inner and outer, discerned the boundary between honor and disgrace.” One who fastens upon the spirit and forgets the form—poverty and wealth, life and death, human and beast, self and other—are all but passing travelers; what difference is there? Now, if one employs the mind in this manner, then the Dao of ruler and minister, of friends, will be abandoned; the heart of love and hate, joy and anger, will be severed. By what method could this be cured?\n\nWenzi then instructed Long Shu to stand with his back to the light. *Shiwen* notes: *bèi* (“back”) is pronounced *pèi*. Wenzi himself stepped behind and faced the light to observe him. *Shiwen* reads: “Wenzi stepped behind and faced the light to observe him,” adding that versions inserting “from” or “self” below “Wenzi” are incorrect. After a while, he said: “Ah! I see your heart now: a space of a square inch, utterly empty. You are nearly a sage! Your heart has six apertures flowing freely, with one still unopened.” The annotation states: According to the old saying, the sage’s heart has seven apertures. Wang Chongmin notes: *Yulin* (sections 376, 401, and 724) all quote “flowing freely” as “freely flowing.” Now, those who take sagely wisdom as an affliction may do so for this reason! This is not something my shallow art can cure.\n\nHere the *Exegesis* states: Standing with one’s back to the light is to revert to the concerns of the common and vulgar; facing the light to observe is to look up and measure the heart that reaches toward the supreme Dao. The emptiness of the square inch arises from clinging to the written word; the one aperture that remains unopened means that perfection is not yet complete. Now, if all seven apertures were freely flowing, would one still take the Dao of sagely wisdom as an affliction? This affliction is not something Wenzi’s shallow art can cure.\n\nQin Enfu remarks: The *Exegesis*’s “clinging to the written word” may be a corruption of the two characters *shì jìn* (“power exhausted”). Bo Jun notes: The *Exegesis*’s “look up and measure” should likely read “look up and fathom.”\n\nThat which arises without cause and yet is ever-generative is the Dao.\n*Annotation*: To forget all cares and let things pass, whether in success or failure, is to be without fatal ground—this is the Dao of the sage.\n*Exegesis*: The supreme Dao abides constantly, not dependent on external things. It arises from life and so lives on, and thus, though it may come to an end, it does not perish—this is constancy.\n*Annotation*: Laozi says, “That which dies yet does not perish is longevity.” To grasp the principle of life’s continuity without losing the primal meeting of supreme good fortune—even when it comes to death—is the way by which the Dao of life abides constantly. This is the portion allotted to the worthy, not that which can be attained by forgetting all cares and obscurely attaining spontaneity in its fullness.\n*Exegesis*: True constancy follows principle, moving with the transformations of life and death while never perishing—this is the constancy of the Dao.\n\n*Shiwen* notes: *fèn* (“portion”) is read as *fú wèn* (“to inquire”).\n\nThat which arises from life and yet perishes is misfortune.\n*Annotation*: To employ cunning in pursuit of self-preservation, to value the self and demean things, to turn from harm and seek profit, to be inwardly bound while outwardly driven—even if one comes to death, it is due to misfortune.\n*Exegesis*: To covet life and lose the Dao is misfortune.\n\nSome versions read “pursue self-preservation” as “bind the self.”\n\nThat which arises without cause and yet is ever-dying is also the Dao.\n*Annotation*: To follow the principle of certain death and proceed to a place of certain death—this correspondence of fact and principle is also the natural Dao.\n*Exegesis*: The common understanding of ritual and teaching is that one must part and come to death.\n\nThat which arises from death and so dies—though it may not yet have reached its end, it perishes of itself—is also constancy.\n*Annotation*: To be constant in death, though one may not yet have reached the end, is to have already exhausted the principle of life—this too is the constancy of principle.\n*Exegesis*: To cherish the body of life and death, to practice the teachings of life and death, and not to preserve the Dao—this the common take to be constancy.\n\nIn all versions, the character *yě* (“also”) is missing below “is also constancy”; here it is supplied following the Jifu edition.\n\nThat which arises from death and yet lives is good fortune.\n*Annotation*: To violate principle and defy the natural order, to be due for death yet not yet reach it—this is mistaken life.\n*Exegesis*: To dwell in the work of change and decline while moderating one’s desires is also to know the good fortune of life.\n\n*Shiwen* reads: “That which arises from death and yet lives is misfortune,” noting that most versions lack the character *bù* (“not”). The text above seems incomplete in principle, so it has been added here.\n\nRen Dachun states: In the current text, the character *bù* (“not”) is missing below “lives.” Upon examination, there should be a *bù* below “lives.” The meaning of this passage is structured in parallel pairs: just as that which follows the Dao of life and dies is misfortune, so too is that which follows the Dao of death and lives also misfortune. Jing Shun’s explanation that there should be a *bù* below “lives” aligns perfectly with the parallel structure of this passage and should be taken as the definitive version.\n\nBo Jun notes: Yin’s and Ren’s interpretations may be debated; the explanation by Tao Hongqing below is smoother.\n\nThus, to live without employing [the Dao] is called the Dao; to employ the Dao and attain one’s end is called constancy.\n*Annotation*: To employ the Dao of the sage is to accord with principle in life and death.\nTo die while employing [the Dao] is also called the Dao; to employ the Dao and attain death is also called constancy.\n*Annotation*: To ride the principle of peril and harm to one’s own destruction is also the constancy of the Dao.\n*Exegesis*: Not to employ cunning in pursuit of self-preservation is the Dao; to employ this Dao and reach one’s end is constancy. The common scholar employs his cunning to the point of death, taking this as the Dao of aiding others; to employ this Dao and reach death is also called constancy.\n\nWhat the multitude delights in, the multitude takes as the Dao; what the multitude finds secure, the multitude takes as constancy. Thus, the Dao of transcendence and the Dao of the worldly realm share the same name but differ in substance.\n\nTao Hongqing states: “That which arises without cause and yet is ever-dying is also the Dao”—Zhang’s annotation reads: “To follow the principle of certain death and proceed to a place of certain death—this correspondence of fact and principle is also the natural Dao.” If this is so, then it is entirely indistinguishable from what is called “that which arises from death and so dies,” and its meaning is even more incongruous with the earlier “that which arises without cause and yet is ever-generative is the Dao.” “To live without employing [the Dao]” and “to die while employing [the Dao]”—*yòng* (“employ”) is also *yóu* (“cause”). From “to live without employing [the Dao]” onward, the four sentences do not differ in meaning from the text above. Moreover, having said “to employ the Dao and attain one’s end is called constancy,” to then say “to employ the Dao and attain death is also called constancy” is to equate “end” and “death,” which is not the style of this text. The passage is verbose in wording and obscure in meaning, easily leading to errors in transmission; after being tampered with by the unlearned, it has become the corrupted version we have today. After examining the intent of this text, I venture to correct its wording as follows, leaving it as a matter for further consideration:\n\nThat which arises without cause and yet is ever-generative is the Dao. It arises from life and so lives on, and thus, though it may come to an end, it does not perish—this is constancy. That which arises from life and yet perishes is misfortune. That which arises without cause and yet is ever-dying is the Dao. It arises from death and so dies, and thus, though it may not yet have reached its end, it perishes of itself—this is constancy. That which arises from death and yet lives is good fortune. To live while employing [the Dao] is also called the Dao; to employ the Dao and attain life is also called constancy. To die while employing [the Dao] is also called the Dao; to employ the Dao and attain death is also called constancy.\n\nThe \"ever-generative without cause\" and \"ever-dying without cause\" are described in the *Tianrui* chapter as: \"That which does not live can give life to life; that which does not transform can bring about transformation\"—this is what is called \"self-generation and self-transformation.\" The \"generative through employment\" and \"dying through employment\" are described in the *Tianrui* chapter as: \"That which lives cannot but live; that which transforms cannot but transform\"—this is what is called \"the workings of yin and yang, the succession of the four seasons.\"\n\nThe \"generative through life\" refers to the worthy and the sagely; the \"dying through death\" refers to Jie and Zhi. The \"attaining life through employing the Dao\" and \"attaining death through employing the Dao\" mean following the transformations and moving with them—this is what the subsequent text calls \"the death of the common people.\"\n\nThe \"generation and death without cause\" and the \"generation and death through employment\" are both spoken of in terms of the Dao of Heaven, and thus are called the Dao. The \"generation through life, death through death,\" and the \"generation and death through employing the Dao\" are all spoken of in terms of human affairs, and thus are called constancy.\n\nWhen Ji Liang died, Yang Zhu gazed at his gate and sang.\n**[Note]** Having fully followed the Dao of life and proceeding to death, there was nothing to mourn.\nWang Chongmin notes: The *Taiping Yulan* (487) quotes \"sang\" as \"did not weep.\" The note \"life-following\" is written as \"life-nature\" in another version.\nBo Jun observes: The *Strategies of the Warring States* (*Wei Ce*) states: \"The King of Wei wished to attack Handan. When Ji Liang heard of this, he turned back mid-journey, his clothes singed and unstraightened, his hair dusty and unwashed, to admonish the King of Liang,\" but it is unclear whether this is the same Ji Liang.\n\nWhen Sui Wu died, Yang Zhu caressed his corpse and wept.\n**[Note]** Having lived in misfortune and died, there was cause for grief.\n\nThe life of the common people, the death of the common people—some sing, some weep.\n**[Note]** \"Common people\" refers to the masses. Not knowing why they live or why they die, their grief and joy lose their balance, and so they sing or weep.\n**[Explanation]** Those who grasp the principle of complete life and return to their end are why the sage and worthy do not mourn. Those who lose their true nature, violate principle, and proceed to death are why the wise and worthy grieve. The singing and weeping of the common people at life and death are all the constant patterns of things—how could they know where it will lead?\n\n**[Note]** In the text below \"common people,\" the *Zang* edition includes the character \"者.\"\n**[Explanation]** The eye about to go blind first sees the tip of an autumn hair.\n**[Explanation]** The vision of the elderly is far-reaching, but when they see what is near, it is blurred—this is the gradual onset of blindness.\n**[Phonetic Gloss]** *Miao* (眇), *wang shao* cut. *Du* (睹), read as *du* (睹).\n\nThe ear about to go deaf first hears the flight of a gnat.\n**[Explanation]** In Qin, mosquitoes are called *rui*. Those with ear ailments hear the sound of insects flying in their ears—this is the gradual onset of deafness.\n**[Phonetic Gloss]** *Rui* (蚋), *er rui* cut.\n\nThe mouth about to lose its taste first distinguishes the waters of the Zi and the Sheng.\n**[Note]** *Shuang* (爽) means deviation. The waters of the Zi and Sheng have different tastes; once mixed, they are difficult to distinguish.\n**[Explanation]** *Yu ling* cut. Two water names in the land of Qi.\n**[Four Explanations Edition]** Zhang’s note includes the character \"者\" after \"爽\" and \"辩\" after \"难.\"\nQin Enfu notes: The character \"渑\" should precede the gloss \"余陵切.\"\n**[Phonetic Gloss]** *Zi* (淄), read as *zi* (锱); *Sheng* (渑), read as *sheng* (乘). The Zi River emerges from Laiwu County in the Lu Commandery; the Sheng River flows west from the border of Qiancheng County in the Beihai Commandery to Shouguang County, where the two waters converge. The *Shuofu* chapter states: \"When the Zi and Sheng waters mix, Yi Ya could taste them.\" *Bie* (别), *bei lie* cut, same below.\nBo Jun observes: The source of the Zi River is twenty-five *li* west of the abandoned county seat of Boshan, on the northern side of Yuanshan, flowing through Linzi Town and east of Guangrao County into the Xiaoqing River. The Sheng River flows northwest from outside the ancient Qi city in Linzi Town, passing southwest of Guangrao County and emptying into Mada Lake.\n\nThe nose about to be blocked first detects the scent of burning and decay.\n**[Note]** Burning and decay have the qi of nodes—subtle and difficult to distinguish.\n\nThe body about to stiffen first hastens to run and flee.\n**[Note]** *Jiang* (僵) means to fall. Like Yan Yuan knowing that Dongye’s driving of the horses would lead to a runaway—it is the same with human affairs.\n**[Note]** In the *Four Explanations* edition, the character \"之\" appears after \"人.\"\n**[Phonetic Gloss]** *Jiang* (僵), read as *jiang* (姜). *Ji* (亟), *qu li* cut. *Fangyan* states: \"亟 means to receive.\" *Ben yi* (奔佚), read as *ben yi* (奔逸). *Pu* (仆), read as *fu* (赴).\nBo Jun observes: \"亟 *receives*\"—\"receives\" (*shou* 受) should be \"loves\" (*ai* 愛).\n\nThe mind about to be deluded first discerns right and wrong.\n**[Note]** The eyes, ears, mouth, nose, body, and mind—these six constantly attain the Dao of harmony and cannot be altered or changed. Occupying an extreme position, none do not suddenly come to an end. Thus, the decay of things must first begin with fullness, and then proceed to loss. Reaching the peak and turning downward, extreme prosperity must decline—this is the natural principle.\n\nTherefore, the sage dwells in the center and treads the path of harmony, seeing what the eyes see, hearing what the ears hear, following the body’s abilities, and yielding to the mind’s discernment. Thus, their wisdom encompasses all things, and they preserve their wholeness throughout life.\n**[Explanation]** When the mouth loses its proper taste, it distinguishes other flavors; when the nose loses its sense of smell, it detects other scents; when the body is about to stiffen, it first hastens to run; when the mind is deluded about the Dao, it is due to right and wrong. Right and wrong thus become manifest, and the Dao is thereby lost.\n**[Note]** In the phrase \"cannot be altered or changed,\" the character *yu* (渝) appears as *ce* (侧) in the Northern Song edition and as *ce* (测) in the *Daozang* and *Shidetang* editions.\n**[Phonetic Gloss]** *Yu* (渝), read as *yu* (俞). *Kang* (亢) is the same as *kang* (抗).\n\nThus, that which does not reach its limit does not return.\n\n**[Annotation]** Only by reaching the ultimate limit does one return, thus keen perception and strong memory become the very resources of darkness, decline, and delusion.\n\n**[Exegesis]** By relinquishing one’s habitual attachments, one ascends to the supreme Dao. Hence it is said: one who sees the tip of an autumn hair cannot perceive Mount Tai; one who hears the buzz of a mosquito cannot hear the crash of thunder. Thus *Zhuangzi* declares: “Obstruct the eyes of Li Zhu, and all under heaven become clear; cripple the fingers of Gongshu, and all under heaven become skillful.” To combine the teachings of Confucians and Mohists, to pride oneself on the wealth of right and wrong, to treasure the dregs of learning as ability—how can one return to the real? By what means can it be attained? Therefore, the *Yijing* states: “No thought, no action. Still and unmoving, yet responsive and penetrating.” This is how the sage earnestly pursues the supreme Dao.\n\n**[Lu Deming’s Note]** The *Zhuangzi* passage cited in Lu’s exegesis is an abridged distillation of the essential meaning of the *Qieqie* chapter, not the original text.\n\n**[Phonetic Gloss]** *Zao* (造), read as *qidao* (七到切). *Huan* (还), read as *xuan* (旋).\n\nThe marshes of Zheng’s fields teemed with worthies—**[Annotation]** those of virtue and power who remained hidden and silent. **[Phonetic Gloss]** *Puze* (圃泽), the marsh of Putian, located in Zhongmou County.\n\n—while Dongli abounded in talent—**[Annotation]** those with administrative skill who participated in state governance. **[Exegesis]** Those who cultivate and exalt the Dao are worthy; those who study texts and scrutinize punishments are talented. **[Phonetic Gloss]** *Zhi* (治), read as *zhili* (直吏切).\n\nAmong the disciples of Puze was one named Bo Fengzi—*yi* (役) here meaning “disciple.” As he passed through Dongli, he encountered Deng Xi. **[Annotation]** Deng Xi was a persuasive and cunning scholar of Zheng, who wielded the doctrine of “two possibilities” with no equal in his time. He composed the *Bamboo Codes*, which Zichan adopted. **[Lu Wenchang’s Note]** The annotation’s “Bamboo Codes” appears as “Bamboo Punishments” in the *Zuozhuan*. **[Phonetic Gloss]** *Yan* (验), read as *ge* (戈). *Xi* (析), read as *xi* (锡).\n\nDeng Xi turned to his followers and laughed, saying: “Dance for him.” **[Phonetic Gloss]** *Wei* (为), read as *yuwei* (于伪切). “What do you make of that one approaching?” **[Annotation]** Some in the world call mutual mockery “dancing and toying.” **[Zhu Junsheng’s Note]** *Wu* (舞) is a loan for *wu* (侮). **[Phonetic Gloss]** *Chao* (嘲), read as *zhangjiao* (张交切). *Diao* (调), read as *tudia* (徒吊切).\n\nHis followers replied: “We wish to know.” **[Annotation]** *Zhi* (知) here means “to hear.” **[Exegesis]** Deng Xi, self-satisfied among his companions, performed this to deceive and mock Bo Feng. **[Chen Bohjun’s Note]** The exegesis’s phrase “performed this to deceive and mock Bo Feng” may contain a miswritten character. **[Phonetic Gloss]** *Zhi* (知), one edition reads *ru* (如).\n\nDeng Xi then asked Bo Fengzi: “Do you understand the meaning of *yangyang*?” **[Annotation]** The first *yang* is read in the fourth tone, the second in the third tone. **[Eight-character note in the Zang edition]** Reads: “First character, departing tone; second character, rising tone.” **[Exegesis]** Zhang Zhan: the first *yang* is pronounced *yang* (扬), the second *yang* (痒). **[Qin Enfu’s Note]** This passage does not appear in the current Zhang Zhan edition. **[Chen Bohjun’s Note]** The exegesis’s citation of the *yang-yang* pronunciation corresponds to the annotation’s “fourth tone, third tone” or “yuliang, yushang.” Lu’s claim that “this passage does not appear in the current Zhang Zhan edition” is incorrect. **[Phonetic Gloss]** *Yangyang* (养养), the first *yang* read as *yuliang* (余亮切), the second as the standard pronunciation.\n\n“Those who are fed by others yet cannot nourish themselves belong to the class of dogs and swine. Those who nourish things and make them serve their own use demonstrate human capacity. To ensure that your followers are fed to satiety, clothed, and rested—this is the achievement of governance.”\n\n**[Annotation]** This likens those who take themselves for governors to dogs and swine. “When the young and old gather in herds to become fodder for pens and kitchens,” Hong Yi remarks: *Ji* (藉) means “to spread as bedding.” The *Yi*’s *Da Guo* hexagram states: “They spread white couch-grass as bedding.” Ma Rong’s commentary: “That which lies beneath is called *ji* (藉).” The *Erya*’s “Release of Beasts” says: “The pig’s resting place is called *zeng* (橧).” Guo Pu’s commentary: “*Zeng* is the mat upon which it lies.” *Ru* (蓐) is synonymous with *ji* (藉).\n\n**[Phonetic Gloss]** *Zhang* (长), read as *zhang zhang* (张丈切). *Ji* (藉) originally written as *ji* (籍), read as *ce ji* (侧戟切). *Lao* (牢) refers to livestock pens or enclosures. *Ji* (籍) also denotes bamboo or wooden fences, or piercing. The *Zhou Li*’s “Turtle Catcher” says: “They fence fish, turtles, and clams in season.” The *Guo Yu* also states: “They net and trap fish.” *Zhuangzi* says: “They stand over the pigpen.” Li Yi comments: “*Lao* is the pigsty; *zha* (栅) is the wooden fence.” Though the characters differ, the meaning is the same. *Cuo* (簎) is pronounced *zha* (栅). *Pao* (庖) is pronounced *pao* (匏).\n\nQin Enfu notes: In the current *Zhuangzi* text, this reads “pen and whip” (*lao ce* 牢策). “How is this any different from the class of dogs and swine?”\n\nBo Fengzi did not respond.\n\n**[Annotation]** Not that he could not respond, but he scorned the question and did not answer.\n\n**[Exegesis]** He deemed him unworthy of discourse, as one fundamentally unfit for conversation.\n\n**[Annotation]** The character *ji* (讥, “scorn”) in the *Shi De Tang* edition is written as *ji* (机, “opportunity”).\n\nOne of Bo Fengzi’s followers stepped out of turn and said:\n\n**[Phonetic Gloss]** *Cong* (从), read as *cai yong* (才用切).\n\n“Has my lord never heard of the many skilled artisans in Qi and Lu?\n\n**[Annotation]** *Ji* (机) means “skill.” There are many people of exceptional ability: some excel in earthworks and carpentry, some in metalwork and leathercraft, some in music, some in calligraphy and mathematics, some in military affairs, and some in ancestral rites. All talents are present, yet none hold positions of coordination, nor can they command one another.\n\n**[Annotation]** When tasks are established, they cannot be universally applied; when skills are mastered, they cannot be universally combined. Those whose craft is specialized and whose wisdom is evenly matched cannot govern or restrain one another.\n\n**[Annotation]** The character *bian* (遍, “universal”) in various editions is written as *pian* (偏, “partial”), which may be an error.\n\nYu Yue remarks: *Wei* (位) should be *li* (莅). *Li* means “to oversee.” It means there is no one to oversee them. The *Zhou Li*’s “Master of Ceremonies” states: “For all military and hunting expeditions where sacrifices are made to the earth and ancestral altars, they establish positions.” The commentary notes: “The old text writes *wei* (位) as *li* (莅),” showing that *wei* and *li* were interchangeable in ancient script.\n\n**[Phonetic Gloss]** *Zhi* (智) is written as *zhi* (知), read as *zhi* (智). Below, infer the meaning. *Xiang* (相), read as *xi liang* (息亮切).\n\nYet those who hold positions lack knowledge, and those who command lack ability, while knowledge and ability are made to serve them.\n\n**[Annotation]** Unable to know what the multitude knows, unable to do what the multitude can do—yet all talents are employed in their service. This is because they do not occupy the position of knowledge or ability, harboring no aversions or preferences, no “this” or “that,” and thus act with a mind of non-action.\n\nTherefore, the clear-sighted see for them, the keen-eared hear for them, the wise plan for them, the brave fight for them, and they themselves remain without concern.\n\nXun Can said to Fu Gu and Xiahou Xuan: “While you live in this world, your fame and achievements surpass mine, but your understanding falls short.” Fu and Xiahou replied: “Success and fame depend on understanding. Who in the world has a weak foundation yet excels in minor matters?” Xun answered: “Success and fame depend on will, which is constrained by its own limitations. Thus, will and limitation are one and the same, and understanding alone cannot ensure success. I can make you esteemed, but I cannot necessarily ensure the success of your endeavors.”\n\n**[Chen Bohjun’s Note]** The exchange between Xun Can and Fu Gu cited in Zhang’s commentary also appears in the *Records of the Three Kingdoms*’ “Biography of Xun Yu,” in the annotation quoting the *Jin Yang Qiu*, though the wording differs slightly. Here it reads: “Success and fame depend on will, which is constrained by its own limitations,” whereas there it reads: “Fame and success are encouraged by the constraints of will.” Thus, the character *bi* (弊, “constraint”) here is likely a corruption of *jiang* (奖, “encouragement”).\n\n**[Phonetic Gloss]** *Bing wei zhi wei* (并为之为), read as *yu wei* (于伪切). Below, infer the meaning.\n\n“Excellent,” pronounced *hu* as in *hu bao* and *hū*. “Detestable,” pronounced *wu* as in *wu lu*. “Can,” pronounced *can* as in *qi han*. “Gu” is read *jia*. “Constrained,” pronounced *ju* as in *qu zu*. “Those who hold office are but tools I employ—why should you take pride in that?”\n\nDeng Xi had no reply; he glared at his disciples and withdrew.\n\n**[Chen Bohjun’s Note]** The *Four Explanations* edition includes a note here, absent in all other versions: “To task the many talents with governance, to employ the myriad things for use, to ensure that chickens and dogs, oxen and horses all find their proper place, and that scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants each rest in their station—only one who embodies the Way can achieve this. How could you claim such things by your own doing? You see only the branches and not the root; you would pit the arm of a mantis against the wheel of a chariot—this is ignorance of measure. Deng Xi, skilled in disputation yet ashamed to be seen by his disciples, thus glared at them and departed.” The note’s “理析” may be a corruption of “理折.”\n\nGongyi Bo was renowned among the feudal lords for his strength. Tangxi Gong spoke of him to King Xuan of Zhou.\n\n**[Phonetic Gloss]** *Gongyi* and *Tangxi* are surnames; both were worthy men of Zhou.\n\n**[Chen Bohjun’s Note]** The *Outer Congeries of Sayings, Right Part I* in the *Han Feizi* records: “Tangxi Gong said to Marquis Zhao,” and in the *Wen Tian* chapter, “Tangxi Gong said to Master Han”—both refer to a different Tangxi Gong.\n\nWang prepared ritual gifts to summon him. Gongyi Bo arrived...\n\nObserving his appearance, he was but a cowardly man. **[Note]** *Cowardly* means weak. The *Cang* edition omits the four characters “pronounced *nu luan* cut.” The *Shiwen* reads: *Cowardly* is pronounced *nuan*.\n\nKing Xuan, perplexed in his heart, doubted and asked: “How great is your strength?” The *Shiwen* reads: *You* is pronounced *ru*.\n\nGongyi Bo replied: “Your servant’s strength can break the leg of a spring katydid,” the *Shiwen* reads: *Break* is pronounced *zhe*. *Katydid* is pronounced *zhong*; another says it is a locust. *Leg* is pronounced *gu*. “And bear the wing of an autumn cicada.” **[Note]** *Bear* means to endure. Yu Yue says: *Bear* should be read as *kan*. The *Shuowen*, under the *ge* radical, states: “*Kan* means to pierce.” The leg of a spring katydid is slender, hence the word *break*—showing that he can snap it. The wing of an autumn cicada is thin, hence the word *kan*—showing that he can pierce it. *Bear* here is a loan character. The *Book of Documents* reads: “The Western Earl having *kan*-subdued Li.” The *Erya*’s *Shigu* commentary cites it as written *kan*, proof that these characters were interchangeable in antiquity. Zhang’s note says “*Bear* means to endure,” but then katydid legs could also be said to *bear*, which fails to capture the precision of the ancients’ language. Hu Huaichen says: *Endure* means to bear the weight. The ancients often used the cicada’s wing to denote the lightest of things. “To *bear* a cicada’s wing” means to support its weight.\n\nThe king changed countenance and said: “My strength can rend the hide of a rhinoceros or young buffalo and drag the tails of nine oxen.” The *Shide Tang* edition adds the character *zhe* after *strength*. The *Shiwen* reads: *Rend* may also be written as *fen*. *Young buffalo* is pronounced *zi*. *Drag* is pronounced *yi*. “Yet I still regret its weakness. You break the leg of a spring katydid and bear the wing of an autumn cicada, yet your strength is renowned throughout the world—why?” The *Shiwen* reads: *Regret* is pronounced *han*.\n\nGongyi Bo sighed deeply, withdrew from his mat, and said: “Excellent is the king’s question! Your servant dares to answer truthfully. Your servant’s teacher is one named Shangqiu Zi, whose strength is unmatched in the world, yet his kin do not know of it—because he has never employed his strength.” **[Note]** He governs things with the utmost suppleness; nothing opposes him, so his achievement is not manifest.\n\n“I would die for him. He instructed your servant, saying: ‘If one wishes to see what others cannot see, one must observe what others do not peer at; if one wishes to obtain what others cannot obtain, one must cultivate what others do not practice.’” **[Note]** Others always attack what is difficult; I alone do what is easy. **[Explanation]** What the multitude does and sees are but the paths of profit and fame, the traces of action. What the multitude does not peer at or practice is where the man of the Dao roams. Thus, one who is unmatched in the world has no opposing force.\n\nWang Lai says: In the explanation, there should be a *not* before *peer*. The *Shiwen* reads: *Easy* is pronounced *yi*, the same below.\n\n“Therefore, one who studies vision first sees a cartload of firewood; one who studies hearing first hears the tolling of a bell.” The *Shiwen* reads: *Cart* is pronounced *yu*. *Bell* is pronounced *zhong*.\n\n“For one who has ease within, there is no difficulty without.” **[Note]** The ancients said: One skilled in strength lifts the autumn down; one skilled in hearing perceives the thunderclap—this is what is meant. The *Shiwen* reads: *Thunderclap* is pronounced *ting*.\n\n“With no difficulty without, one’s name does not leave one’s household.” **[Note]** The Dao’s ultimate achievement is mysterious, so one’s name is not proclaimed. **[Explanation]** A cartload of firewood is a nearby thing; the tolling of a bell is a great sound. What is easily heard and seen proceeds from near to far. One who is skilled in living first nurtures his spirit. When the spirit is whole, the achievement of non-action becomes manifest, and no external thing is not penetrated. Thus it is said: One who has ease within has no difficulty without. This is attained in the single mind and perfected in the single household, so outsiders do not know.\n\n“Thus one’s name does not leave one’s household.” The Northern Song edition, *Cang* edition, Qin engraving of Lu Chongxuan’s edition, and Wang’s edition read *household*; the Jifu edition and *Shide Tang* edition read *household*. Qin Enfu says: Lu’s commentary also reads *household*. Wang Zhongmin says: The Northern Song edition’s *household* as *Dao* is nearly correct; Zhang’s note, “The Dao’s ultimate achievement is mysterious,” etc., proves this. **[Chen Bohjun’s Note]** Wang’s view seems unexamined. Zhang’s note, “The Dao’s ultimate achievement is mysterious,” precisely explains the principle of “not leaving one household,” and further states, “thus one’s name is not proclaimed.” “One’s name is not proclaimed” precisely explains the meaning of “not leaving one household.” “One’s name does not leave one’s household” directly follows the preceding “his kin do not know” and contrasts with the following “your servant’s name is heard among the feudal lords.” Its corruption to *Dao* was precisely due to Zhang’s note, “The Dao’s ultimate achievement is mysterious.” Now we follow the Jifu and *Shide Tang* editions to correct it. The *Shiwen* reads: One edition writes *one Dao*, but this does not extend the meaning.\n\n“Now your servant’s name is heard among the feudal lords—this is your servant’s violation of his teacher’s teaching and the display of his ability.” **[Note]** He has not yet been able to prevent his name and traces from being manifest.\n\n“Yet your servant’s name is not due to failing to bear his strength,” **[Note]** He still avoids boasting, thus able to attain renown. The *Cang* edition’s note reads *more* for *still*, and *attain this* for *attain renown*. “But to being able to employ his strength.” **[Note]** One who skillfully employs his strength does not employ his strength.\n\n“Is this not better than failing to bear one’s strength?” **[Note]** Boasting of ability and displaying its use. **[Explanation]** Though I do not match my teacher’s concealment of his traces, how is this not better than bearing one’s ability and displaying oneself?\n\nThe one who unites with the Great Dao to transform the myriad things does so by virtue of his power. Thus Zhuangzi said: “Hiding a mountain in a marsh, concealing a boat in a ravine—one of great power could shoulder them away at midnight, yet the deluded would remain unaware.” Yet King Xuan mistook this for mere physical strength.\n\nWang Lai said: The explanation for *you* should include the two characters *yuyu* (“better than”).\n\nZhongshan Gongzi Mou was a worthy prince of the state of Wei. **[Note]** Gongzi Mou, son of Marquis Wen, composed four chapters, which were classified as Daoist. When Wei conquered Zhongshan, it enfeoffed the land to Mou, hence he was called Zhongshan Gongzi Mou. **[Explanation]** Gongzi Mou was the son of Marquis Wen, enfeoffed at Zhongshan, thus called Zhongshan Gongzi.\n\nSun Yirang said: The Zhongshan of Xianyu was first conquered by Wei when, in the seventeenth year of Marquis Wen, Yue Yang besieged it for three years before annexing it, granting the land to Zi Ji. Later, Ji was established as crown prince, and the second son, Zhi, was enfeoffed instead. After Zhongshan regained its independence, it was again conquered by Zhao in the fourth year of King Huiwen. Both events are recorded in the *Records of the Grand Historian* under the hereditary houses of Wei and Zhao, as well as in the biography of Yue Yi. The *Liezi*’s “Zhongni” chapter, the *Zhuangzi*’s “Rang Wang” chapter, the *Lüshi Chunqiu*’s “Shen Wei” chapter, and the *Huainanzi*’s “Dao Ying Xun” all refer to Wei’s Zhongshan Gongzi Mou. Gao You and Zhang Zhan both state that Wei conquered Zhongshan and enfeoffed it to Mou. However, Wei Mou was contemporaneous with Zhao’s Lord Pingyuan, Qin’s Wei Dan, and Fan Sui, by which time Zhongshan had long been under Zhao’s control—how could it still belong to Wei? Thus, Mou’s enfeoffment must not have been in Xianyu’s Zhongshan, and this is beyond doubt. Zhang Zhan further identified Mou as the son of Marquis Wen of Wei, conflating Mou with Zhi, which is particularly erroneous—Yang Liang had already expressed skepticism about this.\n\nBo Jun’s note: The *Han Shu*’s “Yi Wen Zhi” lists *Gongzi Mou* in four chapters under Daoist works.\n\nBo Jun’s further note: Qian Mu’s *Xian Qin Zhuzi Xinian Kaobian*’s “Wei Mou Kao” states: Later scholars suspect the *Liezi* to be a forgery by Zhang Zhan, yet passages like this one demonstrate profound and exceptional reasoning, likely derived from ancient texts or remnants of the four chapters, which Zhang could not have fabricated.\n\nShen Qinkan said: Zhang Zhan’s note reads, “Gongzi Mou, son of Marquis Wen.” By the time of Gongsun Long, over a hundred years had passed since Marquis Wen—he could not have been his son. The *Shiwen* notes: *Mou* is pronounced *mohou*.\n\nHe delighted in associating with worthy men and neglected state affairs. The *Shiwen* notes: *Delighted* is pronounced *hubaor*; *neglected* is pronounced *suilü*. He took pleasure in the company of the Zhao man Gongsun Long. **[Note]** Gongzi Mou and Gongsun Long appear to postdate Liezi, yet they are mentioned here—this may be a later interpolation to expand the text’s meaning. If such additions do not violate the work’s general principles and serve to clarify its ideas, what harm do they do? Passages like these are preserved without removal.\n\nBo Jun’s note: The *Han Shu*’s “Yi Wen Zhi” lists *Gongsun Longzi* in fourteen chapters under the School of Names. The present edition contains five chapters and two thousand characters, though some suspect it to be a later forgery.\n\nThe disciples of Yuezheng Ziyu laughed at him. The *Shiwen* notes: *Yu* is pronounced *she*.\n\nGongzi Mou said: “Why do you laugh at my delight in Gongsun Long?”\n\nZiyu said: “Gongsun Long’s character is such that his conduct follows no teacher. The *Shiwen* notes: *Conduct* is pronounced *hang*. He studies without companions. **[Note]** He does not model himself on the sages and worthies. He is glib and unprincipled. **[Note]** Though talented in debate, he does not accord with reason. The *Shiwen* notes: *Accord* is pronounced *zhong*. He is recklessly expansive and without a school. **[Note]** The teachings of Confucians, Mohists, Legalists, and Logicians are all jumbled together without a fixed school. The *Cang* edition and *Sijie* read *fixed school* as *a single fixed school*. The *Shiwen* notes: *Recklessly* is pronounced *man*; *expansive* is pronounced *yan*. He favors the strange and speaks absurdly. **[Note]** He loves the bizarre and makes baseless claims. He seeks to confuse men’s minds and subdue their speech, practicing this with Han Tan and the like.” **[Note]** Han Tan is a person’s name, who studied this art together with him.\n\nZhuangzi said: “In the state of Huan, Gongsun Long could overpower men’s speech but not win their hearts—he was confined to the realm of disputation.” **[Explanation]** His conduct did not follow a teacher; he studied alone without companions. Though eloquent, he did not accord with reason, and his Way was recklessly expansive without a foundation. His teachings could subdue men’s speech but not win their hearts.\n\nHan Tan, as in Zhuangzi, is called Huan Tuan—both are names of persons, similar in sound. The note *Huan Guo* should follow the *Shiwen* and read *Huan Tuan*. *Confined* was originally written as *gu* (“solid”), but here it is corrected to *you* (“realm”) following the *Cang* edition. The *Shiwen* reads *guo* as *tuan*, noting: *Tan* is pronounced *bu’an*; *practiced* is pronounced *yi’er*. *Tuan* is pronounced *daduan*; *confined* is pronounced *you*.\n\nBo Jun’s note: *Tan* should not be pronounced *bu’an* (*bu’an* in *Guangyun* is *tugan*); the *bu* is likely an error. *Practiced* should not be pronounced *yi’er* (*yi’er* in *Guangyun* is *yangzhi*); the *ge* should be *yi* (both *yangzhi* and *yier* belong to the *yu* initial and *zhi* final).\n\nGongzi Mou’s expression changed as he said: “Why do you depict Gongsun Long’s faults in this way? Pray, let me hear the truth.”\n\nZiyu said: “I laugh at how Long deceived Kong Chuan.” 〔Annotation〕 Kong Chuan was Confucius’ grandson. The *Shiji* records him as Long’s disciple. *Deceived* means “to cheat.” The *Shiwen* notes: *Deceived* is pronounced *dai*; it means “to cheat.” The same applies below.\n\nHe spoke of “a master archer who can make the rear arrowhead strike the front nock,” with the *Shiwen* noting: *Arrowhead* is pronounced *zu* (as in *zuomu*). *Strike* is pronounced *zhong* (as in *dingzhong*); the same applies below and in the annotation. “The arrows follow one another in succession, each shaft linked to the next.” The *Shiwen* notes: *Linked* is pronounced *zhu* (as in *zhu*), the same as in the annotation. “The front arrow reaches the target without break or fall, while the nock of the rear arrow still holds the bowstring, appearing as one.” 〔Annotation〕 The arrows are connected without interruption; the front arrow hits the target, and the next arrow strikes the front one, so that what the latter joins still holds the bowstring, appearing as a single continuous object. The *Shiwen* notes: *Hits* is pronounced *zhuo* (as in *zhilüe*); the same applies below. *Target* is pronounced *peng*. *Again* is pronounced *fu* (as in *fuyou*); the same applies below. *Joins* is pronounced *cou* (as in *qidou*).\n\nKong Chuan was astonished. Long said: “This is not yet the most marvelous.” Wang Chongmin notes: The *Taiping Yulan* (745) includes the character *ji* (“ascend”) after *not yet*.\n\nAmong Feng Meng’s disciples was one named Hong Chao. The *Shiwen* notes: *Feng* is pronounced *peng* (as in *bojing*). Enraged at his wife, he sought to frighten her. He drew the *Wuhao* bow and the *Qiwei* arrows. 〔Annotation〕 *Wuhao* was the bow of the Yellow Emperor. *Qi* was a place known for fine arrows. *Wei* refers to the fletching. Wang Chongmin notes: Wang Yinzhi first treated *Qiwei* as a single term, arguing that both were names for arrow bamboo. His explanation states: “The *Fangyan* says: *Bo* is sometimes called *jianli* or *qi*. The *Zhupu* says, ‘□ is *bo* bamboo for arrows.’ If □ is *bo* bamboo called *qi*, then when used for archery, it is also called *qi*. The *Huainanzi*’s *Binglüe* chapter annotation says, ‘Qiwei bamboo is where arrows come from.’ The *Zhupu* cites *Huainanzi* and explains: *Qiyuan* is the land of *Wei*, as in the *Mao Shi*’s ‘Gazing upon that *Qi* bend, the green bamboo so lush.’ *Qi* is the name of a river in *Wei*; to place *Qi* before *Wei* is ungrammatical.” Wang’s view that *Wei* is not a place name is correct, but his claim that *Qi* is also a name for arrow bamboo is likely mistaken. If *Wuhao* is the finest bow, then *Qiwei* should likewise denote the finest arrows. *Bo* arrows differ from archery arrows—can *bo* arrows be considered the finest for archery? The *Huainanzi*’s *Binglüe* chapter reads “Qiwei bamboo”; if all are names for arrow bamboo, why does the *Guangya*’s *Shicao* section list only *junlu* and *□* as arrow bamboo, omitting *Qi*? The theory that *Qi* (or *Qiwei*) refers to arrow bamboo lacks ancient evidence, as Zhang Ji also noted. The *Zhupu* says: “□ is fine.” *Qi* here is simply the *Qiyuan* of *Wei*. *Qiwei* thus refers to the fine bamboo of *Qiyuan*. Arrows made from *Qiyuan*’s fine bamboo could match the strength of the *Wuhao* bow, crafted from mulberry and *zhe* wood. Moreover, if *Qiwei* were arrow bamboo and *jun* were also arrow bamboo, how could they not pair? Wang’s argument is overly rigid. As for *Qiwei*, the *Huainanzi*’s *Yuandao* chapter writes it as *Qiwei*, while the *Binglüe* chapter uses *Qiwei*—both are loan characters; the standard form should be *Qiwei*. The *Taiping Yulan* (745), citing the *Liezi*, also writes it as *Qiwei*. Further, the *Shiming* states: “The side of an arrow is called *yu* (‘fletching’); the people of Qi call it *wei*.” Zhang’s annotation—“*Wei* means fletching”—derives from this. The *Shiwen* notes: *Hao* is pronounced *hao* (as in *hugao*). *Qi* is pronounced *qi* (as in *qiji*). The *Shiji* says: “The bamboo of the state of Qi.” Jin Zhuo notes: “The gardens of Wei abound in bamboo and reeds.” He shot at her eye. The *Shiwen* notes: *Shot* is pronounced *she* (as in *shiyi*).\n\nThe arrow came to lodge in her pupil, yet her eyelids did not blink. Wang Chongmin notes: The *Taiping Yulan* (350) cites “came” as “not yet,” matching the *Shiwen* edition. Further, the *Taiping Yulan* (745) renders the two characters “came to lodge” as simply “to.” It is likely that “came” is a superfluous interpolation, for “to” and “lodge” share the same meaning. The following line reads, “The arrow lodged in her pupil, yet her eyelids did not blink,” directly continuing this thought—thus the superfluity of “came” is evident. Bo Jun observes: Wang’s argument is not precise. The character “came” should follow the *Shiwen* as “tip.” The arrow’s tip refers to its point. The *Taiping Yulan* (350) cites it as “not yet,” which is a misprint of “tip.” The *Shiwen* reads “arrow’s tip,” noting: “Tip is written in one edition as ‘came.’” *Pupil* is pronounced *mou* (莫侯切). *Orbit* is pronounced *kuang* (匡). *Blink* was originally written as *qi* (), meaning the flickering of the eye, and so below. *Qi* () is pronounced *qia* (且洽切). Ren Dachun states: The *Leipian* gives both *blink* (睫) and *qi* () the pronunciation *she* (失涉切), describing the movement of the eye; thus in one edition, *blink* is also written as *qi* (). The *Records of the Grand Historian*, “Biography of Bian Que,” reads: “Dimly perceiving the flicker.” The *Suoyin* comments: “*Qi* () is *blink* (睫),” providing evidence for the interchangeability of *blink* and *qi*. The *Shiwen* also defines *blink* as the flickering of the eye. Consulting the *Leipian*, “flickering” refers to the rapid opening and closing of the eye. The *Hanfeizi*, “Illustrations of the Laozi,” records: “Hui Zi said to the Lord of Zhou, ‘If someone were to meet you and wink one eye at you, what would you do?’ The Lord replied, ‘I would surely kill him.’ Hui Zi said, ‘A blind man winks both eyes at you—why do you not kill him?’ The Lord said, ‘He cannot help but wink.’” The meaning of *qi* () here may serve as evidence for its definition as “flickering.” The arrow plunged into the earth, yet no dust rose.\n\n[Annotation] The arrow’s momentum was so extreme that, though it struck, it was imperceptible—what is meant by “the tip of a strong crossbow cannot pierce Lu gauze.” The *Shiwen* writes “pierce” as “tear,” noting: *Plunged* is pronounced *zhui* (坠). *Crossbow* is pronounced *nu* (其两切). *Tear* is written in one edition as “pierce.” *Gauze* is pronounced *gao* (古老切).\n\n“Could these be the words of a wise man?” *Shiwen* notes: *with* is pronounced *yu*.\n\nGongzi Mou said: “The words of the wise are inherently beyond the comprehension of the dull-witted.” [Annotation] This is said in jest to Ziyu.\n\nThe rear arrowhead strikes the front nock, the hook of the latter trailing behind the former. [Annotation] When the later shot follows the earlier, there is nothing it does not hit.\n\nIn recent times, there was a man who cast five dice, achieving a hundred *lu* in a hundred throws. People thought him possessed of some Dao, and reported this to Wang Yifu. Wang Yifu said: “There is nothing extraordinary here—he simply casts the later throw as he did the earlier one.” Yu Zisong, upon hearing this, remarked: “Lord Wang’s words unwittingly grasp the principle.” All these are of the same kind.\n\n[Textual Note] The Wang edition writes *later shot* as *shot after shot*, *hundred throws* as *one who throws*, and *Song* for *Zong*. The present version follows the Northern Song edition and the *Zang* edition in emendation.\n\n*Shiwen* notes: *cast* is pronounced *zhì* (直炙切).\n\nAn arrow pierces the pupil yet the socket does not blink—this is the full momentum of the arrow. [Annotation] One who can gauge the momentum of bow and arrow, the measure of near and far, will know whether it enters the target or not by the calibration of hand and mind, without fear of miscalculation. Now, if we suppose even the clumsiest archer blindly shoots toward the target’s limit, he must hit its extremity. When he hits its extremity, the arrow will not advance by a hair’s breadth. By blindly aiming for the limit, he adjusts depth according to distance.\n\nLiu Daozhen said to Zhang Shuqi: “I once discussed this with Le Yanfu, who said: ‘This need not be the province of the worthy alone—even the archers of Confucius and Yan Hui must have known this.’” Zhan considered this a matter of form and function, the coarser aspect of principle. To grasp the Dao in part is to master it fully. As with Pao Ding wielding his blade or Carpenter Shi swinging his axe—these are partial attainments in a single craft, not feats requiring sages or worthies.\n\n*Shiwen* notes: *measure* is pronounced *fèn* (符问切). *Miscalculation* is pronounced *cuō dié* (蹉绖). *Said* is pronounced *yǔ* (鱼据切).\n\nWhy do you doubt this?\n\n[Solution]\nWhen the rear of the draw-hook aligns behind the front, every shot is as the first—hence the eye sees them as one. When the socket does not blink, the arrow’s force expires at the eyelash, so no dust stirs on the ground; it does not fall because it strikes the lash. Ziyu’s “seeing them as one” means that from bowstring to target the arrows link unbroken like a single strand; his “hearing the arrow strike the pupil and drop” means the shot does not enter the eye. This interpretation fails to grasp the ultimate principle and wrongly accuses Gongsun Long of sophistry.\n\nYue Zheng Ziyu said: “You are a disciple of Long—how can you not gloss over his gaps?” *Shiwen* notes: *yan* is pronounced *yúqián* (于虔切). “I shall speak of his more glaring errors.”\n\n[Annotation] *You* means “extreme.”\n\nLong deceived the King of Wei, saying: “Intention arises without mind.”\n[Annotation] Mind is quiescent, without thought. If wayward intentions and concerns arise, one loses the root of mind.\n[Solution] What moves in the mind is called intention. The world recognizes intention but does not recognize mind.\n\n“There is pointing, yet it does not reach.”\n[Annotation] To seek arrival through pointing is to rely on the self to rectify things. Relying on the self to rectify things is to fall short of the limit. Only by forgetting what one relies on can both sides attain the mysterious.\nHuizi said: “Pointing does not reach.”\n[Solution] All pointing is not yet arrival. Arrival is without pointing.\n\n“There is thing, yet it is not exhausted.”\n[Annotation] Within the realm of coarse existence, there is always being; at the verge of exhaustion, the One always remains. The One remains undivided, and though one may wish to diminish it, principle does not permit exhaustion. Only by following without diminishing, by conforming without violating, do the towering majesty of Mount Tai and the vast expanse of primordial qi merge indistinctly into one.\nHuizi said: “A one-foot staff, halved each day, will not be exhausted in ten thousand generations.”\n[Solution] If it were exhausted, it would not be being. A one-foot staff, halved each day, will not be exhausted in ten thousand generations because, though divided many times, it becomes minute yet principle does not allow it to be exhausted.\n[Annotation] *Chui* in the Northern Song edition is written as *jìng*; in the Shide Tang edition, as *shén*.\n\n“There is shadow, yet it does not move.”\n[Annotation] Shadow arises from light. If light does not move, shadow is newly generated. All things change imperceptibly, and none is different. The deluded have not awakened, so the analogy of shadow is used.\nHuizi said: “The shadow of a flying bird never moves.”\n[Solution] Movement changes shadow. New shadows follow in succession, so no movement is perceived.\n[Annotation] *Weichang* in Wang’s edition is written as *weiyi*; here corrected according to the Zang edition. The character *bu* in “light does not move” is likely an interpolation.\n*Shiwen* notes: *jie* is pronounced *ziyi* (子亦切).\n\n“A single hair can draw a thousand jun.”\n[Annotation] What causes things to break is always an uneven point. Where every point is even, nothing can break. Thus a hair, though fine, can balance a heavy weight because its force is perfectly even.\n[Solution] Fine as it is, a hair can lift a thousand jun—just as the weight of many hairs can break an axle yet remain light.\nBo Jun notes: The *Mozi Jingxia* states: “Evenness does not break—explanation lies in evenness.”\n\n“A white horse is not a horse.”\n[Annotation] This argument has many debaters. All debaters lack broad understanding, so it is omitted here without discussion.\n[Solution] “White” names color; “horse” names form. “A white horse is not a horse” debates form and color.\n[Annotation] *Jianzai* in the original edition is written as *jiancun*; in the Zang edition, as *jianzai*.\n*Liezi Jishi*, Juan Five, “Tang Wen Di”\n\n〔Annotation〕What wisdom limits as knowable is nothing compared to what it does not know; yet the world equalizes its own perceptions to limit all things. Thus the great sages pose questions, and those who exhaust principles respond.\n\n〔Solution〕The nature of the myriad things each prizes its own life, yet they do not know how to nurture what sustains their life, instead loving the body to the point of losing their life. Therefore, this chapter discards form to preserve life and thereby penetrate their nature; when nature is penetrated, the disposition is reached, and when the disposition is reached, the Dao is realized.\nQin Enfu notes: Lu’s explanation of the character *zhu* in “sustains their life” is likely erroneous.\n*Shiwen* states: *Qi* is read as *caixi*.\n\nYin Tang asked Xia Ge—\n〔Annotation〕*Ge* is pronounced *ji* in the *Zhuangzi*.\nGuo Qingfan notes: *Ge* and *ji* were homophonous and interchangeable in antiquity. The *Analects* records “Ji Zicheng,” while the *Han Shu: Guren Biao* writes “Ge Zicheng.” The *Book of Songs* says, “Not thorny are their desires,” which the *Li: Fangji* quotes as “Not *ge*-like are their intentions.” The *Han Shu* mentions “Zhuzao Hou Ge Zhu,” and the *Shiji Suoyin* notes, “*Ge* is pronounced *ji*,” all serving as evidence.\n*Shiwen* states: Yin Tang’s surname was Zi, given name Lü, courtesy name Tianyi. *Ge* is pronounced *ji*. Xia Ji’s courtesy name was Ziji, and he served as Tang’s minister.\nBo Jun notes: The *Shiwen*’s “Xia Ji” is likely an error for “Xia Ge.”\n\n—“Did things exist in the earliest antiquity?”\n〔Annotation〕Perhaps only a vast, indistinct chaos.\n*Shiwen* states: *Mang* is pronounced *mang*.\n\nXia Ge replied: “In the earliest antiquity, there were no things—how could there be things now?\n〔Annotation〕That there are things now is because there were things in antiquity.\nLu Wenchang notes: The Zang edition includes the character *zhi* after “now” and “antiquity,” and *ye* after “therefore.”\n*Shiwen* states: *Wu* is pronounced *wu*, the same below.\n\nWould later people be justified in saying there are no things now?”\n〔Annotation〕Later generations will surely take the present as antiquity, for antiquity and the present are like a cycle. If later people were to claim there are no things now, it would be untenable.\nThe *Lushi Qianji* 2 includes the character *shi* before “later.”\n*Shiwen* states: *Fu* is read as *fuyou*, the same below.\n\nYin Tang said: “Then are there no before and after among things?”\nXia Ge replied: “The end and beginning of things have no ultimate limit. What begins may become an end, and what ends may become a beginning—how can one know their order?\n〔Annotation〕What is now called an end may be the beginning of something; what is called a beginning may be the end of something. End and beginning follow one another in an unbroken cycle, making them ultimately indistinguishable.\nJiang Yougao notes: *Shi*, *yi*, *ji* rhyme, all belonging to the ancient *zhi* rhyme group.\n\nYet beyond things and before events, I do not know.”\n〔Annotation〕Beyond things and before events, there is only vast emptiness, leaving nothing to point to or speak of.\n\n〔Solution〕If later generations must take today as antiquity, how is it different from today’s inquiry into antiquity? How could there be no things? From Tang’s perspective, antiquity lies before, yet the beginning of things and the origin of events alternate in sequence—this cannot be known.\n\nYin Tang asked: “Then do the eight directions above and below have limits or boundaries?”\n〔Annotation〕Though Tang and Ge exchanged answers, their perceptions and hearing remained unclear, so Tang posed this question again to achieve complete clarity.\nWang Shumin notes: The *Shiwen* edition of the annotation has *hua* instead of *jin*; this is likely correct. The *Zhuangzi: Gengsang Chu* chapter’s “those of its ministers who were *huaran*-knowing departed” is the source of these two characters. *Jin* is probably a graphical error for *hua*, or a corruption influenced by the character *jin* in the main text.\n*Shiwen* states: *Chong* is read as *zhuyong*, the same below. *Hua* is pronounced *huo*; one edition has *jin*.\n\nGe replied: “I do not know.”\n〔Annotation〕It is not that he does not know, but that it cannot be known through wisdom.\nTang pressed the question.\nGe said: “If there is nothing, then there is no limit; if there is something, then there is a boundary—how could I know this?\n〔Annotation〕To exhaust the limitless and bound the limited is to reason from the unknown by analogy.\nTao Hongqing notes: The character *you* below “if there is something” should also be *wu*. “If there is something, then there is no boundary” aligns with Gongsun Long’s “there are things that are inexhaustible,” Hui Shi’s “a one-foot stick, halved each day, will never be exhausted in ten thousand generations,” and the Western notion of “the indestructibility of matter.” The following passage, “Beyond the limitless there is no further limitless; within the boundless there is no further boundless,” develops this idea. The current text’s error of *you jin* (“there is a boundary”) contradicts its intent. Zhang’s annotation, as given, clearly refers to the absence of limitlessness and the presence of boundlessness, indicating that his edition correctly read *wu jin* (“there is no boundary”).\n\nYet beyond the limitless there is no further limitless; within the boundless there is no further boundless.\n〔Annotation〕If it is called limitless, how can there be anything beyond it? If it is called boundless, how can there be anything within it? What is called “no limitless” and “no boundless” is truly limitless and boundless.\nThe Northern Song edition of the annotation reads “if it is called emptiness” instead of “if it is called boundless”; Wang’s edition follows this, but the current text adopts the Zang edition’s correction.\n\nBeyond the limitless there is no further limitless; within the boundless there is no further boundless.\n〔Annotation〕Some might suppose that beyond the limitless there is another limitless, or that within the boundless there is another boundless. Therefore, it is reiterated that beyond the limitless there is no further limitless, and within the boundless there is no further boundless.\n\nFrom this I know that it is limitless and boundless, but I do not know that it has limits or boundaries.”\n〔Annotation〕To know the limitless is to know everything; not to know the limited is true knowledge.\n\nTang further asked: “What exists beyond the four seas?”\nWang Chongmin notes: The *Taiping Yulan* 2 includes the character *hu* after “exists.”\n\nGe said, “It is like the Central State.”\n〔Annotation〕*Qi* means “center.”\n〔Exegesis〕How could the boundless have limits or ends? Thus the Dao pervades all without exception—this is what “nothingness” signifies. Both its essence and function are vast, neither void nor unreal.\n\nBo Jun notes: *Qizhou* refers to the Middle Kingdom. The *King Mu of Zhou* chapter states, “The central region among the four seas is called the Central State,” which serves as evidence. The *Exegesis on the Text* notes: The *Erya* says, “South of the central region, where the sun is overhead, is called Danxue; north of it, where the Dipper is overhead, is called Kongtong.” *Ju* means “distance,” and *qi* means “center.”\n\nTang said, “How do you substantiate this?”\nBo Jun notes: The *Huainanzi*’s *Spirit and Light* chapter states, “The multitude regards it as empty words, but I will cite examples to substantiate it.” Gao You’s commentary explains, “*Shi* means ‘to clarify.’” The *Book of Later Han*’s *Annals of Emperor Shun* records, “The edict ordered the inspectors of You, Bing, and Liang provinces to verify and assess officials from *ershiqian shi* down to those with yellow seals, as well as those who were aged, weak, or unfit for military service.” The commentary explains, “*Shi* means ‘to verify,’” both of which elucidate the meaning of *shi* here.\n\nGe said, “When I traveled east to Ying,\n〔Exegesis on the Text〕Today’s Liucheng was ancient Yingzhou; traveling east to the sea confirms this.\nthe people were the same as here.\n〔Annotation〕Just like this region. If one asks about the lands east of Ying, they are still like Ying.\nWhen I traveled west to Bin,\n〔Exegesis on the Text〕*You* is interchangeable with *Bin*.\nthe people were the same as here. If one asks about the lands west of Bin, they are still like Bin. From this I know that the Four Seas, the Four Wastes, and the Four Poles are no different from this.\n〔Annotation〕The meanings of the Four Seas, Four Wastes, and Four Poles are found in the *Erya*. Knowing they are no different from this region confirms that this is the standard.\n〔Exegesis〕The four directions cannot be exhausted, for all contain birth and death, love and hate, parents and children, wives and sons. Thus, I know that beyond the Four Wastes and Four Poles, it is no different from within Ying and Bin—this is the standard.\n\nWang Chongmin notes: Below “之,” the original text likely included “外,” which is now missing. The previous question by Tang asked, “What exists beyond the four seas?” This is Ge’s answer, so it should read “beyond the Four Seas, Four Wastes, and Four Poles.” The *Taiping Yulan* indeed includes “外” after “之.”\nBo Jun notes: Wang’s argument is sound. Lu Chongxuan’s exegesis also suggests his edition included “外.”\n〔Exegesis on the Text〕The *Erya* states: The Nine Yi, Eight Di, Seven Rong, and Six Man are called the Four Seas. Guzhu, Beihu, Xiwangmu, and Rixia are called the Four Wastes. Dong Taiyuan, Xi Binguo, Nan Pujian, and Bei Zhuli are called the Four Poles. *Jian* is pronounced *xianbian*.\n\nBo Jun notes: In the *Exegesis on the Text*, “Taiyuan” may appear as “Qinyuan,” “Binguo” as “Jiaoguo,” and “Bei Zhuli” as “Ci Zhuli,” all of which are errors.\n\nThus, the great and small contain one another without end. That which contains the myriad things is like that which contains heaven and earth.\n〔Annotation〕What contains the myriad things is heaven and earth; what encompasses heaven and earth is the Great Void.\n〔Exegesis on the Text〕“Great Void” is written as *daxu*; *da* is pronounced *tai*, and the same applies below.\nIt contains the myriad things and thus is inexhaustible.\n〔Annotation〕Heaven and earth contain transformations; yin and yang receive qi. The myriad things flow into form, succeeding one another without ceasing in one life or ending in one form—thus, it is inexhaustible.\nIt contains heaven and earth and thus is without limit.\n〔Annotation〕Heaven and earth enclose the Three Luminaries and embrace the Four Seas—they are vast indeed. Yet as material forms, they must have limits. If one exhausts their limits, how could they not be void? Calculating that heaven and earth exist within the Great Void, they are as if present and as if absent. Thus, all within the realm of bounded space, whether large or small, numerous or few, are relative. Extending this to the ultimate of nothingness, how could it be exhausted by one heaven or bounded by one earth? Then heaven and earth and the myriad things mutually envelop one another, alternating as states and cities. How could one know their fullness or emptiness or measure their totality?\n\nI also how do I know that beyond heaven and earth there are not greater heavens and earths?\n〔Annotation〕The Great Void is boundless, while heaven and earth are limited. Encompassing the limited within the boundless, heaven and earth are not necessarily the greatest of forms. Thus, what Zou Yan spoke of was merely within his grasp.\n〔Annotation〕In the *Shide Tang* edition, “掌” is written as “尝.”\n〔Exegesis on the Text〕*Yan* is pronounced *yuqian*, and the same applies below.\nThis, too, is something I do not know.\n\n〔Annotation〕All myriad affairs may be inferred by principle, yet cannot be verified by instruments. Thus, those who trust only what their minds and intellects can grasp, yet do not know that such knowledge has limits, possess but superficial understanding. Those who affirm only what their ears and eyes perceive, yet do not know that seeing and hearing have bounds, are common scholars. As for the penetrating person, they dissolve the obstructions of mind and intellect, mystically awakening to the wondrous principles beyond wisdom. They break through the barriers of sight and hearing, distantly attaining the marvelous forms beyond things.\n\nAs for those who confine their emotions and thoughts within bounded realms, who tread only within the six directions—such ones will claim that all records are exhausted by the *Three Tombs* and *Five Classics*, that the *Gui Cang* is fully contained within the four seas and nine provinces. Knowing the vastness of the Great Void, the boundlessness of the immense and minute, that heaven and earth are but a single dwelling and the myriad things but floating dust—all these are but narrow views of the present age, dimly perishing together.\n\nThus, Master Lie expounded the ultimate words of what has no inside, to smooth the obstructions of mind and intellect; he proclaimed the vast teachings of what has no outside, to open the barriers of sight and hearing. Thereby, those who aspire to the wind unconsciously release their self-importance, and those bound by doctrine unknowingly cast off their shackles.\n\nThus, he carved away the Confucians and Mohists, pointing out the great Dao—was this merely a fondness for the strange and a vain pursuit of the extraordinary? Alas! Lao Dan and Zhuang Zhou were already mocked by世论, how then could you alone escape such censure?\n\nHere follows the translation:\n\n---\n\nThe spiritual Dao embraces the myriad things, thus it is inexhaustible; yin and yang embrace heaven and earth, thus they are without limit. Beyond heaven, earth, and the myriad things lies what I cannot discern with reason—this does not mean I know nothing at all.\n\nThe annotation for \"无垠\" originally read \"无限,\" but here it follows the *Shidetang* edition as \"无垠.\" The *Shiwen* notes: \"限\" is rendered as \"垠,\" and states, \"The character '及' in '知及' appears in one version as '反,' which may be a textual error.\" *Huò* is pronounced *hūkuò*. *Yín* is read as *yín* (like \"silver\"), and the same applies below; one version writes it as *xiàn*. *Jū* is pronounced *jū*. *Zhìgù* is pronounced *zhìgǔ*. *Jiě* is pronounced *xiè*. *Kū* is pronounced *kū*. *Kuā* is read *kǒuhuā*. *Dān* is pronounced *tāgān*, the name of Laozi. *Zhōu* is the name of Zhuangzi.\n\nThus, heaven and earth are also things. Since things are insufficient, in ancient times Nüwa smelted the five-colored stones to mend their deficiencies.\n\n**Annotation:** When yin and yang lose their measure, the Three Luminaries expand and contract—this is what causes the deficiencies of heaven and earth, not necessarily a flaw in their physical forms. Nüwa was a divine being, thus she could refine the essence of the Five Constants to harmonize yin and yang, ensuring the solar and stellar degrees followed their proper sequence, without needing to physically patch them with material objects.\n\n**Exegesis:** Zhang Zhan’s annotation here is apt. Qin Enfu notes: \"练\" is the ancient form of \"炼,\" and the *Huainanzi* also writes it as \"练.\" He Xiou remarks: Zhang Zhan’s annotation, interpreting the five-colored stones as an allegory for the Five Constants, is but a clever turn of phrase. The philosophers of the Warring States often intermingled with the novelists, and not all can be scrutinized. Even in the *Liezi*, the tale of the Lord of Longbo fishing for the giant turtle, or the discourse on the transformed man’s robe—what do these parables truly signify? Wang Shumin observes: The *Yiwen Leiju* (6), *Taiping Yulan* (2 and 51) all include the character \"之\" before \"石,\" making the syntax consistent with the following text; this should be adopted. The *Shiwen* states: *Wā* is pronounced *guā*; Nüwa was an ancient sovereign, of the Feng clan.\n\nShe broke the legs of the giant turtle—\n\n**Annotation:** The *ao* is a colossal turtle. The *Shiwen* notes: *Duàn’áo* is pronounced *duàn’áo*, as explained later.\n\n—to establish the Four Pillars. Later, Gonggong contested with Zhuanxu for the throne.\n\n**Editor’s Note:** The *Records of the Three Sovereigns* in the *Shiji* states he fought with Zhu Rong, while the *Huainanzi*’s \"Yuandao\" chapter says he vied with Gaoxin for the throne, and the \"Tianwen\" chapter claims he contended with Zhuanxu—these are all variant traditions from antiquity. The *Shiwen* notes: Gonggong was an ancient emperor, *Gōng* pronounced *gōng*; *Zhuānxū* is pronounced *zhuānxū*.\n\nEnraged, he struck Mount Buzhou—\n\n**Annotation:** Gonggong rose to power between the eras of Fuxi and Shennong. His descendants, relying on their strength, later contested with Zhuanxu for the throne. Zhuanxu was a grandson of the Yellow Emperor. Mount Buzhou lies at the northwestern extreme. Lu Wenchang notes: In the annotation, after \"Zhuanxu,\" the *Zang* edition includes the character \"是,\" and after \"Yellow Emperor,\" the character \"之.\"\n\n—snapping the pillar of heaven and severing the cords of earth. Thus, heaven tilted to the northwest, and the sun, moon, stars, and planets moved there. The *Shiwen* reads *Fú* as *fú*, noting: *Fú* is pronounced *fú*. *Xī* is pronounced *xǔyí*.\n\nEarth was not full in the southeast, so the hundred rivers and floodwaters flowed there.\n\n**Exegesis:** To disrupt the constant order and corrupt virtue is to break the pillar of heaven and sever the cords of earth. Therefore, the sage knows the heavenly Dao diminishes excess to supplement deficiency, so the Three Luminaries and the hundred rivers attain their great essentials. The *Shiwen* notes: *Lǎo* is pronounced *lǎo*.\n\nTang further asked: \"Do things have greatness and smallness? Do they have length and brevity? Do they have sameness and difference?\"\n\nThe *Ge* said: \"East of the Bohai Sea, beyond countless millions of *li*, there lies a great abyss.\" The *Shiwen* notes: *Bóhǎi* refers to present-day Le’an Prefecture. The *Shan Hai Jing* states: \"Beyond the Eastern Sea is a great abyss, truly a bottomless valley.\" The *Commentary* adds: This is recorded in the *Dahuang Jing*. The *Han Shenyun* of the *Book of Songs* says: \"Flowing east into the bottomless valley.\" Below it lies no bottom. The *Commentary* explains: To call it bottomless is merely to express the extremity of its depth. The preceding line states there is no limit, no end that can be exhausted. Even if it were truly bottomless, there would be nothing to astonish. The *Commentary*’s final character *hài* (\"astonish\") appears as *hé* (\"obstruct\") in the Shide Tang edition.\n\nIt is called the *Guixu* (Returning Abyss). The *Commentary* cites *Zhuangzi*: \"Weilü.\" Hong Yí notes: The *Li Shan* commentary on the *Wen Xuan*’s *Wu Du Fu* and the *Taiping Yulan*, fascicle 67, both cite *Liezi* as reading *Guītáng* (\"Returning Pool\"). The *Yan shi Jiaxun*’s *Guixin* chapter states: \"The *Guītáng* and *Weilü*—where do the waters disperse?\" This also matches certain alternate versions. Wang Chongmin observes: The *Taiping Yulan*, fascicles 60 and 67, both read *Guītáng*, matching the alternate version noted in the *Shiwen*. The *Shiwen* adds: *Guixu* appears in some versions as *Guītáng*.\n\nThe waters of the eight cords and nine fields, the flow of the Celestial Han, all pour into it without increase or decrease. The *Commentary* explains: The eight cords are the eight poles; the nine fields are the eight directions of heaven and its center. Tradition holds that the Milky Way connects with the sea. The *Exegesis* states: The bottomless great abyss signifies the inexhaustibility of the great Dao. That which is most subtle and fine, entering into the spaceless, is none other than water. Its lack of increase or decrease signifies that the ten thousand existents contain nothing it does not embrace. The *Shiwen* notes: *Hóng* is pronounced *hóng*.\n\nWithin it stand five mountains: the first is called Daiyu. The *Shiwen* notes: *Yú* is pronounced *yú*. The second is called Yuanqiao. The *Shiwen* notes: *Qiáo* is pronounced *qúmiào* (a mountain sharp and tall). The third is called Fanghu. The *Shiwen* notes: It is also called Fangzhang. The fourth is called Yingzhou. The *Shiwen* notes: *Yíng* is pronounced *yíng*. The fifth is called Penglai. The *Shiwen* notes: The *Records of the Grand Historian* states: Fangzhang, Yingzhou, and Penglai—these three divine mountains lie in the Bohai Sea. It is said that those who have reached them find all the immortals and the elixir of deathlessness there. From afar, they appear like clouds. When one draws near, they recede, and in the end, none can reach them.\n\nThe mountains rise and fall in a circuit of thirty thousand *li*. The *Shiwen* reads \"circuit\" as *zhōufàn*, noting: *fàn* is written in one version as the character for \"pattern/model\" and in another as the character for \"circuit.\" Ren Dachun states: The *Records of Rites* reads, \"Casting metal and combining earth.\" The *Xunzi*’s \"Strong States\" chapter reads, \"The penal model is just.\" The *Taiyuan Jing* reads, \"The ruler’s model for the state.\" The *Lishi*’s *Yang Zhuo Stele* reads, \"Losing this teacher’s model.\" The *Fragmentary Stele of the Minister of Works* reads, \"Receiving my molten model.\" Thus *fàn* often serves as a loan for *fàn* (the *Tongsu Wen* states: \"Scale is called *fàn*,\" so *fàn* should be written as *fàn*). The *Feng Sheng Stele* reads, \"Establishing the central diagram □,\" where □ is also the character for \"model,\" and *fàn* is interchangeable with □. However, *fàn* as a loan for *fàn* (to violate) is rarely seen. Chen Changqi, Compiler of the Imperial Archives, states: The *Zhuangzi*’s \"Great and Venerable Master\" chapter reads, \"Now, to mold a man’s form and say, ‘Man! Man!’—the Creator must deem this an inauspicious person.\" Here, \"molding a man’s form\" is equivalent to \"modeling a man’s form,\" providing one instance where *fàn* and *fàn* are interchangeable. The flat summit of each mountain spans nine thousand *li*. The distance between the centers of these mountains is seventy thousand *li*, and thus they are neighbors.\n\nTheir towering terraces and pavilions are all of gold and jade, and the birds and beasts upon them are pure white. Tao Hongqing states: \"The two characters *qí shàng* ('upon them') govern the following six clauses; the second *qí shàng* is an erroneous repetition.\" Wang Chongmin concurs: \"Tao’s observation is correct.\" The *Taiping Imperial Encyclopedia* (vol. 38) omits the second *qí shàng*. The *Exegesis* notes: *chún* is pronounced *chún*; *gǎo* is read as *gǔ-lǎo*.\n\nThe trees of pearl and jade grow in dense clusters. The *Exegesis* notes: *gān* is pronounced *gān*. Their blossoms and fruits all bear savor; to eat of them is to never age or die. Wang Chongmin observes: The *Taiping Imperial Encyclopedia* (vol. 38) omits the second *jiē* (\"all\"), likely a superfluous interpolation.\n\nThe inhabitants are all of the lineage of immortals and sages; those who fly back and forth between them day and night are beyond counting.\n\n**[Annotation]** The distance between two mountains is seventy thousand *li*, and among the five mountains, the total spans two hundred eighty thousand *li*. Yet they traverse this in a single day and night. The number of those who come and go cannot be reckoned, for even the swiftest wind and clouds cannot match their speed.\n\n**[Exegesis]** Tangible things arise within the great Dao, adorned with playthings and delights, unaware of aging or death. Their movements and functions never cease, flitting to and fro in an instant—boundless in number. The Shide Hall edition does not repeat the phrase \"come and go.\" In the line \"cannot be reckoned,\" *bù* (\"not\") is written as *nǎi* (\"thus\") in the Northern Song edition. The *Exegesis* notes: *shù* (\"number\") is pronounced *sè-zhǔ*, and the annotation follows the same reading.\n\nYet the roots of the five mountains have no attachment,\n\n**[Annotation]** Such mountains float upon the sea; by this reasoning, all realms of form are lodged within the great void, thus lacking any root or stem.\n\nLu Wenchang notes: The annotation omits the character *yú* (\"upon\") after *fú* (\"float\") in the Zang edition. The *Exegesis* writes *zhuó* as *zháo*, noting: *zháo* is pronounced *zhí-lüè*.\n\nEver rising and falling with the tides, the *Exegesis* notes: *shàng* (\"rise\") is pronounced *shí-zhǎng*, they cannot pause even for a moment.\n\n**[Exegesis]** The five senses—eye, ear, nose, tongue, and body—drift with the waves and cannot rest even briefly. This illustrates how the world is swept along by sound, form, fragrance, and flavor, ceaselessly entangled, even to the point of forgetting life and scorning death in pursuit of fame and profit. They do not know how to still their thoughts, return to the source, nurture the spirit, and restore the Dao.\n\nThe *Exegesis* writes *zàn* (\"briefly\") as *zǎn*, noting: *zhì* (\"pause\") is pronounced *zhí-lǐ*.\n\nThe immortals and sages found this grievous, the *Exegesis* notes: *dú* means \"to afflict,\" and appealed to the Emperor. The Emperor feared they would drift to the westernmost reaches, losing the abode of the assembled immortals and sages. Lu Wenchang notes: The Fang edition writes *kǒng* (\"feared\") as *nù* (\"enraged\"), and *qún xiān shèng* (\"assembled immortals and sages\") originally as *qún shèng* (\"assembled sages\"). The Zang edition has *xiān shèng* (\"immortals and sages\"), while the Sijie and Qin editions read *qún xiān shèng* (\"assembled immortals and sages\").\n\nYu Yue states: The Lu Chongxuan edition reads, \"The Emperor feared they would drift to the westernmost reaches, losing the abode of the assembled immortals and sages,\" which should be followed. The five rooted mountains, having no attachment, would naturally drift to the westernmost reaches—what cause for anger would there be? The error likely arises from the following phrase, \"the Emperor’s wrath.\" Moreover, the term *xiān shèng* (\"immortals and sages\") appears three times in the text, proving that *qún shèng* (\"assembled sages\") here is incorrect. The phrase *xī jí* (\"westernmost reaches\") is also suspect. If the five mountains rise and fall with the waves, how can one be certain they would drift only westward? The subsequent line, \"Mounts Daiyu and Yuanqiao drifted to the northernmost reaches,\" confirms they need not drift solely westward. *Xī jí* (\"westernmost reaches\") should likely be *sì jí* (\"four extremities\").\n\nBo Jun notes: Yu’s argument is sound; the present text follows the Qin and Sijie editions, adding the character *xiān* (\"immortals\").\n\nWang Shumin states: The *Yiwen Leiju* (96), *Taiping Imperial Encyclopedia* (931), and *Shiwen Leiju* (postface, 35) all include the character *shàng* (\"Supreme\") before *dì* (\"Emperor\"). The *Jinxiu Wanhua Gu* (supplement, 5) includes *tiān* (\"Heaven\") before the second *dì* (\"Emperor\"). The present text likely omits *shàng* or *tiān* before both instances of *dì*.\n\nThereupon, he commanded Yuqiang,\n\n**[Annotation]** The *Classic of the Great Wilderness* states: This is the name of the god of the northernmost reaches, whose emissary is the sacred turtle. The *Exegesis* writes *Yúqiáng* as *Yúqiáng*, noting: *yú* is interchangeable with *yú* (\"corner\").\n\nThe *Biographies of Divine Immortals* states: The god of the north is named Yuqiang, styled Master of Dark Mystery.\n\nThe *Classic of Mountains and Seas* states: In the great wilderness there is a god with the face of a man and the body of a bird, named Yuqiang.\n\nJianwen notes: This is the sea god.\n\nRen Dachun states: The *Huainanzi*’s \"Treatise on Terrain\" reads, \"*Yúqiáng* is where the *bùzhōu* winds arise,\" and Gao You’s commentary states: \"*Yúqiáng* is a celestial deity.\"\n\nThe *Commentary on the Water Classic* states: The county is named Panyu, perhaps referring to the *yú* (\"corner\") of Mount Pan.\n\n\"*Pānshān zhī yú*\" (\"the *yú* of Mount Pan\") is akin to \"*Pānshān zhī yú*\" (\"the corner of Mount Pan\").\n\nThe *Classic of Mountains and Seas* states: \"The Eight Trees of Guilin lie east of *Pānyú*.\" Guo Pu’s commentary notes: \"*Pānyú* is present-day Panyu County.\" Thus, *yú* and *yú* are interchangeable.\n\nTo have fifteen giant turtles lift their heads and bear them aloft.\n\n**[Annotation]** The *Li Sao* states: \"The giant turtles bear the mountains—how can they be at peace?\" Bo Jun notes: The present *Chuci*’s *Heavenly Questions* reads: \"The turtles bear the mountains and dance—how can they be at peace?\" Wang Yi’s commentary cites the *Biographies of Divine Immortals*: \"The giant spirit-turtle bears Mount Penglai and dances in the sea.\" Hong Xingzu’s supplementary commentary first cites this passage from the *Liezi*. The *Exegesis* notes: The *Biographies of Divine Immortals* states: \"The giant turtles bear Mount Penglai and dance in the sea.\" The *Yuan Zhong Ji* states: \"They are giant turtles.\"\n\nThey took turns in three shifts, the *Exegesis* notes: *fān* is pronounced *fān*, meaning \"to alternate,\" with one rotation every sixty thousand years.\n\nThe five mountains first stood firm and unmoving.\n\n**[Annotation]** For the corporeal form is the dwelling of the numinous spirit. If the five faculties drift and lose their proper governance, then immortals and sages will have no abode. *Zhuangzi* states: \"Once it receives its completed form, it does not perish until its end.\" If the five faculties drift aimlessly, they will follow delusion to death. A life spent in vain—how lamentable! Thus the great sages established methods and teachings to restrain them, and the five faculties thereby found stability. The five dusts correspond to them, the five senses arise from them, hence the term \"fifteen.\" Through the mind they are discerned, hence the term \"three shifts.\" Every sixty thousand years they alternate—from this one understands the Dao of restraining the five faculties.\n\nThe *Tibetan*, *Qin*, and *Shidetang* editions omit the three characters \"and unmoving.\" Wang Chongmin notes: The *Leiju* (96) and *Taiping Yulan* (803, 834) include these three characters, suggesting they were omitted in modern editions. Bo Jun notes: The *Wen Xuan* annotations to Zuo Taichong’s *Wu Du Fu*, Mu Xuanxu’s *Hai Fu*, *Taiping Yulan* (931), and Hong Xingzu’s supplementary commentary to the *Chuci*’s *Heavenly Questions* all include these three characters.\n\nIn the land of the Longbo, there were giants who, in fewer than several steps, reached the location of the five mountains. The *Northern Song* edition reads \"several thousand,\" followed by Wang’s edition; the present text follows the *Tibetan* edition in emending this. Wang Chongmin notes: The *Northern Song* edition writes \"thousand\" for \"steps,\" matching one variant noted in the *Exegesis*. The *Leiju* (96) cites it as \"several tens of steps,\" which may be closer to the original. Likely, the *Northern Song* edition’s \"thousand\" is a corruption of \"ten,\" with the following \"steps\" omitted. Bo Jun notes: The *Taiping Yulan* (931) and *Shiwen Leiju* (Later Collection, 35) both cite it as \"several tens of steps.\" The *Exegesis* notes: *shu* is pronounced *se zhu*; *bu* (\"steps\") in one variant is written as *qian* (\"thousand\").\n\nWith a single hook, they caught six giant turtles.\n\nThe *Exegesis* notes: *diao* (\"hook\") in one variant is written as *he* (\"join\"); *qu* is pronounced *qu* (\"to hasten\").\n\nThey returned to their land and scorched the turtles’ bones to divine by them.\n\n**[Annotation]** A mountain thirty thousand *li* in height and circumference is borne on the head of a single turtle, yet these six turtles were all drawn by a single hook. The people of Longbo could carry them all at once and even bore into their bones to calculate—such a person’s form must have spanned over a million *li*. Compared to them, the *kun* and *peng* are but mosquitoes, midges, fleas, and lice. Then what in the great void could not be contained?\n\n**[Annotation]** *Bo* means \"elder.\" The dragon, bearing the six emotions, seeks its own ease—how much more does it lose its proper governance through the might of its strength! This illustrates how, among the vulgar, desires for sensuality, pride, love, greed, indulgence, and craving stain and drown, yet they further destroy and employ them. Huang Sheng notes: Character dictionaries all define *ao* as a large turtle, but according to this text, *ao* refers to a turtle, not a large soft-shelled turtle. Qin Enfu notes: The commentary following \"pride\" appears to have omissions or errors. Wang Shumin notes: The *Chuxue Ji* (19), *Caotang Shijian* (35), and *Jinxiu Wanhua Gu* (Continuation, 5) all include the character *yin* (\"thereupon\") before *zhuo* (\"scorch\"). The *Exegesis* notes: *zhuo* is pronounced *zhuo*; *shu* is pronounced *su ju*; *suan* means \"to calculate\"; *zuan* is pronounced *xiang guan*; *kunpeng* is pronounced *kun peng*; *wenrui* is pronounced *wen rui*; *zaoshi* is pronounced *zao se*.\n\nThereupon, the two mountains Daiyu and Yuanqiao drifted to the Northern Ultimate and sank into the great sea, displacing countless immortals and sages.\n\n**[Annotation]** What the vulgar heart drowns in is nothing heavier than sensuality and beauty; gentlemen and petty men alike are ensnared by fame and profit—hence it is said the two mountains flowed away. Love and drowning run deep, likened to the great sea. The drifting of spiritual awareness cannot be fully expressed.\n\nThe Lord was enraged.\n\n**[Annotation]** *Ping* means \"great.\" The *Exegesis* writes *ping* as *feng*, noting: *feng* is pronounced *fen*.\n\nHe diminished the land of Longbo and made it narrow. Wang Zhong notes: *E* (\"narrow\") and *ai* (\"constricted\") are interchangeable, a shift in pronunciation. The *Exegesis* writes *qin* (\"diminish\") as *jin*, noting: *jin* is pronounced *zi jin*, with one variant as *qin*; *e* is pronounced *wu mai*.\n\nRen Dachun notes: The *Records of the Grand Historian* (\"Annals of Emperor Wu\") states: \"It encroached upon Mount Tai.\" The *Suoyin* commentary says: \"*Qin xun* means *jin*.\" The *Huainanzi* (\"Interpretation of Words\") states: \"At the beginning of yin and yang, all is harmonious and alike; as days lengthen their kind, they gradually encroach and grow distant\"—meaning they begin alike but gradually diverge. The *Shiming* states: \"When the eye’s flesh grows into the pupil, it is called *jin*; *jin* means *qin*. It also says *jin* means to gradually enlarge,\" thus *qin* and *jin* are interchangeable.\n\nHe shrank the people of Longbo to make them short. By the time of Fuxi and Shennong, the people of that land were still tens of *zhang* tall.\n\n**[Annotation]** The *Shan Hai Jing* states: Beyond the Eastern Sea, in the great wilderness, there is a land of giants. The *Hetu Yuban* states: Nine hundred thousand *li* north of Kunlun lies the land of Longbo, where people are forty *zhang* tall and live eighteen thousand years before dying.\n\n**[Annotation]** The great sages detested the harm caused by desires and thus established laws to restrain them. As the teachings of sages and wise ones spread, their land gradually shrank. Yet even under Shennong’s governance, they remained tens of *zhang* tall, for people cannot eliminate desires—only diminish them. Wang Chongmin notes: The *Taiping Yulan* (377) includes the character *chang* (\"tall\") after *you* (\"still\"). The *Exegesis* writes \"the people of that land\" as \"there were people of that land,\" and \"tens of *zhang*\" as \"thousands of *zhang*,\" noting: \"Thousands of *zhang*\" in one variant is \"tens of *zhang*.\"\n\nFour hundred thousand *li* east of the Central States lies the land of the Jiao Yao. Wang Chongmin notes: \"East\" should be \"west,\" a scribal error.\n\nThe \"Huainanzi\" in its \"Dropping Form\" chapter states: \"To the southwest lies the land of the Jiao Yao.\" Wei Zhao’s commentary in the *Lu Yu* notes: \"Jiao Yao is another name for the southwestern barbarians.\" Thus, in antiquity, some placed the Jiao Yao in the southwest. The *Taiping Yulan* (790), citing the *Map of Foreign Lands*, records: \"The Jiao Yao lie thirty thousand *li* from Jiuyi,\" which would place them in the south. The *Exegesis*, quoting the *Comprehensive Geography*, states: \"They are north of Da Qin.\" Since Da Qin lies in the southwest, this would place them in the west. Reconciling these accounts, the southwest is the most balanced location. Those who place them in the west or south likely differ only slightly in perspective. Yet no source places them in the east, confirming that \"east\" is indeed a scribal error. This passage records the extraordinary beings of the four directions: the Ming Ling of Jing’s south, the Kun and Peng of the northern wastes, the Zheng People of the northeast, and the Jiao Yao of the west. If \"east\" were correct, it would redundantly overlap with the Zheng People. Thus, \"east\" is a miswritten character, providing further evidence.\n\nThe *Taiping Yulan* (378 and 790) both write \"four\" as \"three.\" It is likely that the original text of the *Liezi* read: \"From the Central States, thirty thousand *li* to the west lies the land of the Jiao Yao.\" Later, the character \"west\" was mistakenly written as \"four,\" leading to the erroneous insertion of \"east\" and the deletion of \"three.\"\n\nThe *Exegesis* notes: \"Jiao Yao is pronounced *Qiao Yao*; it is the name of a land of short people.\" The *Records of the Grand Historian* states: \"The people of Jiao Yao are three *chi* tall, the shortest of all.\" Wei Zhao says: \"Jiao Yao is another name for the southwestern barbarians.\" According to the *Comprehensive Geography*, they lie northwest of Da Qin, and their people are one *chi* and five *cun* tall.\n\n**[Annotation]** This account appears in the *Poems Containing the Spirit’s Mist*.\n\nThe *Exegesis* notes: \"Seen\" is pronounced *xian* (rising tone), as below.\n\nAt the northeastern extreme live people called the Zheng People, nine *cun* tall.\n\n**[Annotation]** See the *Classic of Mountains and Seas*.\n\nThe *Poems Containing the Spirit’s Mist* states: \"At the northeastern extreme dwell such people.\" Having described the large, it proceeds to clarify the small. Qin Enfu notes: The *Classic of Mountains and Seas* writes \"Zheng\" as \"Jing.\" Wang Chongmin says: The *Taiping Yulan* (378) writes \"Zheng\" as \"Jing,\" which should be read as \"Jing.\" The *Shuowen* states: \"Jing: in one sense, it means 'minute.'\" The *Classic of Mountains and Seas: Great Wilderness East* says: \"Beyond the Eastern Sea, in the midst of the great wilderness, lies the land of the Small People, called the Jing People.\" Guo Pu’s commentary notes: \"Jing is sometimes written as Jing.\" The *Exegesis* notes: \"Zheng\" is pronounced *zheng* (rising tone). The *Classic of Mountains and Seas* states: \"Beyond the Eastern Sea dwell small people called the Zheng People.\"\n\nSouth of Jing lies the Ming Ling.\n\nThe *Exegesis* notes: \"Ming Ling is the name of a tree. It grows south of the Yangtze, marking spring by the sprouting of its leaves and autumn by their fall. It takes five hundred years as its spring and five hundred years as its autumn.\"\n\nIn high antiquity, there was the Great Chuen.\n\nThe *Exegesis* notes: \"Chuen is pronounced *chun* (rising tone); it is the name of a tree, also called by this name. It takes eight thousand years as its spring and eight thousand years as its autumn.\"\n\nUpon rotting soil grow fungi and zhi.\n\nWang Chongmin notes: The *Taiping Yulan* (945) writes \"upon\" as \"soil.\"\n\nThe *Exegesis* notes: \"Fungi\" is pronounced *jun* (falling tone). Cui Zhuan says: \"Zhi grow upon dung. They sprout at dawn and die by dusk.\" The *Jian Wen* states: \"They suddenly sprout as zhi, living from dawn until dusk.\"\n\nIn the months of spring and summer, there are meng and rui.\n\nWang Shumin notes: The *Cloudy Satchel* (90) writes \"in the months of spring and summer\" as \"in the clear sky.\"\n\nThe *Taiping Yulan* (945), the *Guangyun* (Upper Tone, 3), and the *Yunfu Qunyu* (9) all write \"meng rui\" as \"mie meng.\"\n\nThe *Exegesis* notes: \"Meng\" is pronounced *meng* (falling tone). \"Rui\" is pronounced *rui* (falling tone), referring to the tiny flying insects known as mie meng, mosquitoes, and rui. These two are small flying creatures that arise with rain and perish upon exposure to sunlight.\n\n**[Exegesis]** If one’s desires cause them to lose their true nature, then what difference is there between the gigantic and the minuscule, the long-lived and the short-lived? Thus, we know that from the highest immortals to the lowliest ants, those who stray from the true and lose the Dao, driven by their passions and desires, suffer the same loss.\n\nNorth of the farthest north—\n\n**[Annotation]** The *Zhuangzi* says \"the barren north.\"\n\nThe Zang and Shide Tang editions write: \"North of the farthest hairy north.\" Wang Zhong says: The *Zhuangzi* says \"barren north\" (*qiong fa*); *zhong* is a variant of *qiong*. Yu Yue says: The *Exegesis* notes that one edition omits the character \"hairy,\" and this should be followed. \"Farthest north\" is the name of a land. Below, it states: \"When Yu governed the waters and earth, he became lost and strayed into a land by the northern sea’s edge, a land called Farthest North.\" Thus, \"north of the farthest north\" means north of that land. The present insertion of \"hairy\" likely stems from later scholars adding it based on the *Zhuangzi*’s *Free and Easy Wandering*. They failed to realize that while the *Zhuangzi* speaks of \"north of the barren north,\" this text speaks of \"north of the farthest north,\" and the two are not the same. If one were to add it here, then saying both \"north of the farthest hairy north\" and \"north of it\" would be redundant.\n\nThe *Exegesis* writes \"north of the farthest hairy north,\" noting: One edition writes \"north of the farthest north.\"\n\n—lies the Dark Sea.\n\nThe *Exegesis* notes: The *Record of the Ten Continents* states: \"The Dark Sea is a celestial pool whose waters are black.\"\n\nThere is a fish there, thousands of *li* in breadth,\n\nThe *Exegesis* notes: \"Breadth\" is pronounced *guang* (falling tone), and \"thousands\" is pronounced *shu* (falling tone).\n\nand its length matches its breadth.\n\nBo Jun notes: The *Artificers’ Record: Wheelwright* says \"it is called *can chen*,\" with the commentary: \"*Chen* means 'equal.'\" Here, \"matches\" should be read with a departing tone.\n\nThe *Exegesis* notes: \"Matches\" is pronounced *chen* (falling tone), as below.\n\nIts name is Kun.\n\nThe *Exegesis* notes: \"Kun\" refers to the whale.\n\nThere is also a bird there, named Peng.\n\nThe *Exegesis* notes: \"Peng\" is pronounced *peng* (rising tone).\n\nIts wings resemble clouds hanging from the heavens, and its body matches its wings.\n\nA note states: *Zhuangzi* says the Kun transforms into the Peng. How could the world know of such a being?\n\nA note states: People amuse themselves with what they commonly see and grow accustomed to what they habitually hear; even if told of it, they would still disbelieve.\n\nThe *Exegesis* notes: \"Told\" is pronounced *yu* (rising tone).\n\nGreat Yu encountered it in his travels, Bo Yi knew of it and named it,\n\nThe *Exegesis* notes: \"Named\" is pronounced *ming* (falling tone), same as *mìng*.\n\nand Yi Jian heard of it and recorded it.\n\nA note states: Strange sights and extraordinary accounts are met with doubt by the multitude. Did Yu, Yi, and Jian merely fabricate fantastical tales to astonish their age? Rather, they clearly affirmed the existence of such beings to dispel the stubborn ignorance of those who cling to their narrow views and to remove the blindness and deafness of those who perceive the world. Though Yi Jian’s name is not widely known, he was one of the ancient masters of broad learning.\n\nBo Jun notes: The *Wen Xuan*’s *Western Metropolis Rhapsody* by Zhang Heng states, \"Bo Yi could not name it, Li Shou could not record it,\"—here, the meaning is inverted.\n\nLu Wenchao says: In the note, the *Zang* edition omits the character \"之\" after \"众,\" and writes \"禹\" as \"焉.\"\n\nThe *Exegesis* notes: \"Recorded it\" means \"wrote it down.\"\n\nBetween the Yangtze and the Pu rivers, tiny creatures are born.\n\nA note states: \"Tiny\" means small.\n\nWang Shumin says: The *Er Ya Yi* (vol. 26) cites \"born\" as \"there are,\" and the *Shi Wen Lei Ju* (Later Collection, vol. 49) cites it as \"on the sea there are insects.\" The current text’s \"there are\" (*you*) is written as \"born\" (*sheng*), which may be an error.\n\nThe *Exegesis* notes: \"Tiny\" is pronounced *yao* (falling tone). The *Character Dictionary* states: \"*Yao* means small.\"\n\nIts name is Jiao Ming.\n\nThe *Exegesis* notes: \"Ming\" is pronounced *ming* (rising tone).\n\nThey flock together and alight upon the eyelashes of mosquitoes without colliding.\n\nThe *Exegesis* notes: \"Eyelashes\" is pronounced *jie* (rising tone).\n\nThey roost and depart, yet the mosquito remains unaware.\n\nLi Zhu and Zi Yu, in broad daylight, wiped their eyes, raised their brows, and gazed upon them,\n\nThe *Exegesis* notes: \"Wiped\" is pronounced *shi* (falling tone). \"Brows\" is pronounced *zi* (falling tone), referring to the corners of the eyes.\n\nbut could not perceive their form.\n\nA note states: Li Zhu was a man of the Yellow Emperor’s time with keen eyesight, able to see the tip of an autumn hair from a hundred paces away. Zi Yu’s name is not recorded.\n\nYu Shi Kuang and Master Kuang, in the dead of night, pricked up their ears, lowered their heads, and listened,\n\nThe *Exegesis* notes: \"Yu\" is pronounced *chi* (falling tone). Both Yu Shi Kuang and Master Kuang were men of ancient times with acute hearing. \"Pricked\" is pronounced *ti* (falling tone). \"Lowered\" is pronounced *mian* (rising tone).\n\nbut could not hear their sound.\n\nA note states: Yu Shi’s name is not recorded. Master Kuang lived in the time of Duke Ping of Jin; Xia Ge had no reason to mention him, so this must be a later embellishment by the compiler.\n\nThose who rely on their minds, intelligence, ears, and eyes to see and hear cannot perceive the most minute of creatures.\n\nLu Wenchao says: In the note, the *Zang* edition includes the character \"而\" after \"缘得.\"\n\nOnly the Yellow Emperor and Rong Chengzi dwelled upon the Kongtong,\n\nLu Wenchao says: The *Zang* edition writes \"峒\" as \"桐.\"\n\nWang Shumin says: The *Yi Wen Lei Ju* (vol. 97) cites \"Rong Chengzi\" as \"Guang Chengzi.\" The *Zhuangzi*’s \"In the Human World\" chapter also writes it as \"Guang Chengzi.\"\n\nThe *Exegesis* notes: The *Records of the Grand Historian* states: The Yellow Emperor reached the river and ascended Mount Kongtong. It is now in Fengquan Prefecture.\n\nThey shared a chamber for three months, their minds stilled and their bodies abandoned.\n\nA note states: This refers to the mind becoming like dead ashes and the body like withered wood.\n\nSwiftly, they perceived with their spirit,\n\nA note states: The spirit is a silent, profound illumination, not dependent on the eyes.\n\nWang Chongmin says: The *Lei Ju* (vol. 97) cites \"swiftly\" as \"suddenly,\" which is correct. For \"suddenly perceiving with the spirit\" corresponds to \"gradually hearing with qi\" below.\n\nBo Jun notes: Wang’s interpretation is overly rigid; the original \"swiftly\" (*xu*) better suits the meaning.\n\nThey saw it as a solid mass, like the slopes of Mount Song;\n\nA note states: To perceive the formless through the spirit is as if seeing Mount Song—yet even that is insufficient to describe its vastness.\n\nGradually, they heard with their qi,\n\nA note states: Qi follows its natural course without relying on external means.\n\nThey heard it with a resounding crash,\n\nThe *Exegesis* notes: \"Crash\" is pronounced *peng* (rising tone).\n\nlike the sound of thunder.\n\nA note states: To perceive sound through emptiness is as if hearing thunder—yet even that is insufficient to describe its magnitude.\n\nAn explanation states: If hindered by form and sound, then piled earth becomes a mountain, and swarming mosquitoes become thunder; to see it as a solid mass or hear it as a crash is hardly surprising.\n\nThe *Exegesis* notes: \"Thunder\" is pronounced *ting* (rising tone).\n\nIn the lands of Wu and Chu, there is a great tree called the *you*.\n\nA note states: Pronounced *xiu* (falling tone).\n\nThe *Exegesis* notes: Pronounced *you* (falling tone). The *Classic of Mountains and Seas* states: \"Jingshan has many orange and *you* trees.\" The *you* resembles the orange but is larger, with thick skin and a sour taste. Its jade-green tree bears fruit in winter, its cinnabar fruit tastes sour.\n\nWang Chongmin says: The character \"\" is the same as \"柚\" (*you*). \"Bears\" (*sheng*) should be \"green\" (*qing*), a scribal error.\n\nThe *Classic of Mountains* states: \"Jingshan has many orange trees.\" Guo Pu’s commentary: \"Resembles the orange but larger.\" The *Records of the Grand Historian*, in the \"Biography of Sima Xiangru,\" states: \"Oranges and *you* are fragrant.\" The *Correct Meaning* says: \"The small is called *ju* (orange), the large *you*. The tree has thorns, does not wither in winter, and its leaves are green.\" Thus, the tree’s leaves are green and do not wither in winter, so the *Liezi* says, \"Its jade-green tree remains green in winter.\" Here, \"green\" (*qing*) was likely corrupted into \"主\" and further miswritten as \"bears\" (*sheng*). The *Essential Techniques for the Common People* (vol. 10) cites it as \"its jade-green tree remains green in winter,\" though it erroneously includes an extra \"bears\" (*sheng*), the \"green\" (*qing*) remains correct. The *Lei Ju* (vol. 87, mistakenly cited as \"Lie Zhuan\" instead of *Liezi*) and the *Imperial Digest* (vol. 973) both correctly cite it as \"remains green in winter.\" \"Jade-green tree, green in winter\" and \"cinnabar fruit, sour in taste\" form a parallel structure. If written as \"bears,\" the parallelism is lost.\n\nWang Shumin states: The *Jizuan Yuanhai* (vol. 92) also cites it as \"green.\" Consuming its bark and juice cures qi-induced ailments. Xu Weiyu notes: Lüshi Chunqiu’s *Utmost Loyalty* commentary glosses \"已\" as \"to heal.\" Wang Shumin adds: \"厥\" is a loan for \"瘚.\" The *Shuowen* defines \"瘚\" as \"reversed qi.\" The *Exegesis* reads: \"愤\" is pronounced *fèn* (房吻切). \"愤厥之疾\" refers to qi disorders.\n\nThe tree is prized in Qi; crossing the Huai northward, it transforms into the *zhi*. The *Exegesis* notes: The *Zhouli* states, \"The orange crosses the Huai north and becomes the *zhi*.\" The myna does not cross the Ji River. The *Exegesis* reads: \"Ji\" is pronounced *jǐ* (子礼切); \"鸲鹆\" is pronounced *qúyù* (瞿浴). The *he* dies upon crossing the Wen. The *Exegesis* reads: \"貉\" is pronounced *hè* (鹤), resembling a fox, a sleep-loving beast; \"汶\" is pronounced *wén* (武巾切). Li Daoyuan’s *Shui Jing* states: The Ji River rises in Mount Wangwu as the Dui (pronounced *yǎn*) River, flows east through Wen to become the Ji, enters the Yellow River after ten *li*, then southward across the river to form Yingze, passing through nine commanderies including Jiyin before reaching the sea. The *Zhouli* states: \"The myna does not cross the Ji; the *he* dies upon crossing the Wen—this is due to the land’s qi.\" Zheng Xuan notes: The Wen River lies north of Lu’s capital. Earlier scholars, following one another, mistakenly assumed this referred to Lu’s Wen River. However, according to the *Records of the Grand Historian*, \"汶\" and \"\" share the pronunciation *wén* (武巾切), denoting the Min River, not the *wèn*-pronounced Wen. The *Shan Hai Jing* states: The Great River issues from Mount Min. Guo Pu comments: It flows southeast through Shu Commandery, northeast through Badong and Jiangxia, then enters the sea at Guangling. The *Han Shi Waizhuan* states: \"Of old, the Jiang River rose in Mount Min; at its source, it was but a cup’s depth.\" The *Chu Ci* also reads: \"Hidden in the clear Jiang of Mount Min.\" This is conclusive. Moreover, the *Liezi* and *Zhouli* both speak of the differing natures of water and soil, such that relocation causes harm. Thus, the Four Rivers are cited as examples.\n\nNow, Lu’s Wen River spans no more than a few dozen paces, its source no more than two hundred *li*. One could wade across it in moments—how could a fox or *he*, briefly crossing, face life and death so abruptly? The *Shuowen* states: \"The *he* is a fox-like creature.\" All thrive on hills and dry land. Today, people along the Jiang say foxes do not cross the river. Clearly, crossing great waters harms their nature, even unto death. This is the land’s qi at work.\n\n[Note] This principle is also found in the *Zhouguan*. The Qin edition reads: \"This is the land’s qi at work.\"\n\nNevertheless, though their forms and qi differ, their natures are equal. Wang Shumin states: The *Exegesis* reads, \"One edition adds '情' (emotion), rendering it '情性钧已' (emotions and natures are equal).\" This is correct. \"Emotions and natures are equal\" parallels the earlier \"forms and qi differ.\" The *Exegesis* notes: All punctuate at \"已.\" One edition reads: \"Emotions and natures are equal.\" They do not exchange with one another. All beings are whole; all parts are sufficient. The *Exegesis* reads: \"分\" is pronounced *fèn* (符问切).\n\n\"How can I discern their greatness or smallness? How can I know their length or brevity? How can I recognize their sameness or difference?\"\n\n[Note] Myriad beings, myriad forms, myriad natures, myriad emotions—each rests in its proper place, none failing to fulfill its role. Thus, their natures are equal and whole, with no desire for exchange. How could wisdom distinguish them?\n\n[Exegesis] What is born of yin and yang, suited to the land, touched by spiritual qi, or altered by habit—all are thus. What need is there to debate it?\n\nThe Taihang and Wangwu Mountains—\n\n[Note] \"形\" should be \"行.\" Taihang lies in Heyang County, Henan; Wangwu in Dongyuan County, Hedong. Wang Chongmin states: The *Taiping Yulan* (vol. 40) cites \"行\" for \"形,\" likely amended by the compiler. The *Exegesis* reads \"太形\" as \"大形,\" glossing it as *tàxíng* (泰行), with the same note. \"垣\" is pronounced *yuán* (袁).\n\n—span seven hundred *li* and rise ten thousand *ren*. Originally situated south of Jizhou and north of Heyang. The Foolish Old Man of North Mountain,\n\n[Note] The common term \"foolish\" does not necessarily imply lack of wisdom.\n\naged nearly ninety, lived facing the mountains. Harassed by the mountains’ northern blockade and the circuitousness of his comings and goings,\n\n[Exegesis] \"形\" is pronounced *xíng* (户刚反). \"惩\" means caution, trauma, or governance. The *Exegesis* notes: The *Han Shi Waizhuan* glosses \"惩\" as \"suffering.\" \"迂\" is pronounced *yū* (于), as below.\n\nhe gathered his household to deliberate: \"I propose we unite our strength to level the perilous terrain, opening a path south to Yuzhou and reaching the northern bank of the Han River. Is this feasible?\" They all assented.\n\n[Note] \"杂\" means \"all.\" The *Exegesis* reads: \"杂\" is pronounced *zá* (七合切), as below; \"佥\" is pronounced *qiān* (七廉切).\n\nHis wife raised a doubt,\n\n[Note] \"献疑\" means to pose a challenge. The *Exegesis* reads: \"难\" is pronounced *nàn* (乃旦切).\n\nsaying: \"With your strength, you cannot even reduce the mound of Kuifu. What can you do to the Taihang and Wangwu?\n\n[Note] Kuifu is a small hill in Chenliu. The *Taiping Yulan* cites the *Huainanzi*: \"A puddle from an ox’s hoof holds no carp a foot long; the hill of Kuifu yields no timber for a hut—both are too narrow to contain greatness.\" The *Yiwen Leiju* (Mountains section) cites the *Huainanzi* with \"魁父\" as \"□府.\" The original text reads \"魁阜,\" differing in character but identical in sound. The *Exegesis* reads: \"曾\" is pronounced *céng* (层), as below. The *Huainanzi* writes \"魁阜,\" meaning a small hill like a mound.\n\nWhere will you dispose of the earth and rocks?\" They replied: \"Dump them into the tail of the Bohai Sea, north of Yintu.\"\n\n[Note] The *Huainanzi* states: \"The northeasternmost land is called Yintu.\"\n\nLiu Jiun's note: The current edition of the *Huainanzi*'s \"Dixing Xun\" reads, \"In the northeast lies the land called Bohai; it is called Yintu.\" The character \"得\" in the annotation is likely a scribal error.\n\nThereupon, he led his descendants—three men capable of bearing loads—striking rocks and breaking earth, transporting the soil and stones with baskets to the tail of the Bohai Sea.\n\nA widowed wife from the neighboring Jingcheng clan, who had a fatherless boy just coming of age, leapt forth to assist them.\n\nRen Dachun notes: The *Han Shu*'s \"Annals of Emperor Gao\" states, \"The King of Han leapt forth.\" Jin Zhuo explains, \"To leap forth is to act on one’s own initiative,\" as seen in the subsequent line, \"Alone, he departed with Lord Teng through the Wang Gate of Chenggao.\" In this passage of the *Liezi*, which recounts Yu Gong’s removal of the mountains, none came to his aid, yet the fatherless boy alone rushed to help—hence the phrase \"leapt forth to assist.\" The sense of \"leapt forth\" here aligns with Jin Zhuo’s gloss, mutually confirming its meaning.\n\nHong Yi notes: The *Han Shu*'s \"Annals of Emperor Gao\" reads, \"The King of Han leapt forth.\" Ru Chun glosses, \"Leapt is pronounced *tao* (逃), meaning to flee.\" The *Records of the Grand Historian* writes it as \"fled.\" Jin Zhuo states, \"To leap forth is to act on one’s own initiative.\" The *Biography of King Yan* in the *Han Shu* reads, \"Thereupon, he leapt forth and galloped to Chang’an,\" also meaning to flee swiftly.\n\nThe *Exegesis* notes: \"Leapt\" is pronounced *tiao* (調), meaning to jump. Some write it as *tiao* (眺), which is incorrect.\n\nWinter and summer alternated, and only then did they make a single return trip.\n\nThe River Bend Wise Old Man laughed and sought to dissuade him. {Note: Though commonly called wise, he was not necessarily free from folly.} He said, “How extreme is your lack of wisdom! With your waning years and remaining strength, you cannot even destroy a single blade of grass on the mountain—what then can you do with the earth and stones?”\n\nThe Old Fool of North Mountain sighed deeply and said, “Your heart is so obstinate that it cannot be penetrated. {Pei Jun notes: *Che* means ‘to penetrate.’ *Shiwen* reads: *che*, *chou lie* cut.} You are not even the equal of a widow or a weak child. Though I should die, I have a son who remains. {Wang Chongmin notes: *Yuwenzhui* 519 cites *cun* as *zai*.} The son will beget a grandson, the grandson will beget a son; the son will have a son, the son will have a grandson: sons and grandsons will have no end, yet the mountain will not grow larger—why then should we not level it?” All editions of the *Daoist Canon* read: “How could it not be leveled?” {Wang Chongmin notes: The *Shiwen* edition and *Jifu* edition read *ku* as *ruo*, which is correct; the error likely arose from their graphic similarity. *Yuwenzhui* 40 includes the character *ke* above *ping*. *Shiwen* reads *ku* as *ruo*, noting: *ruo* is an alternate reading for *ku*.}\n\nThe River Bend Wise Old Man had no reply. {Note: His reasoning was defeated, and his will subdued.}\n\nThe Spirit Who Wields the Serpent, having heard of this, {Note: The *Classic of Great Wilderness* states: “The mountain and sea spirits all grasp serpents.”} feared that it would not cease, {Note: If it did not cease, the mountain would surely be leveled.} for all the world knows that piling up the small can make the great, yet none perceive that wearing away the much can reduce it to little. The nine-tiered tower rises from heaped earth, and the lofty bank in time becomes a hidden gorge. If effort is never abandoned, not confined to morn or eve, then nothing is too minute to accumulate, and nothing too vast to diminish. Now whetstone and blade, grinding without end, show that both will be worn away. If these two things are so, then hills and valleys waxing and waning leave no room for doubt. Those who are confused by size or speed have yet to extend their reasoning by analogy.\n\nThe *Shiwen* reads “bank” as “peak,” noting: *Cao* is pronounced *qī dāo*. “The lofty peak falls into a hidden gorge” is rendered in one version as “the lofty bank in time becomes a hidden gorge.” *Shě* is pronounced *shè*. *Dǐlì* is pronounced *zhǐ lì*. He reported it to the Emperor. The Emperor, moved by his sincerity, {Note: Moved by the Foolish Old Man’s utmost sincerity.} commanded the two sons of Kuafu, {Note: Kuafu, unrecorded in transmitted texts, was evidently a being of divine strength.} The *Shiwen* notes: *Kuā’é* is rendered in one version as *Kuāyǐ*. *Kuā* is pronounced *kǒu huā*. to bear the two mountains away—one placed in the northeast, {The *Shiwen* notes: *Cuò* is pronounced *cuò*.} the other in the south of Yong. From then on, south of Ji and north of the Han, no ridges blocked the way. {Note: Those who expect results by dawn and dusk sigh when the year draws to a close; those who seek glory in their own time grieve when it fades after their death. Such are the short-sighted concerns of the common man, the ordinary sentiments of a single generation. But the great person takes heaven and earth as a single morning, a hundred million ages as a fleeting instant; forgetful of self in pursuing the task, effortless in achieving the work; whether here or there, in oneself or in others, perceives no difference, knows no before or after. Thus the Foolish Old Man of North Mountain and the widow’s orphaned child suffice to mock the wisdom of the River Bend Wise Old Man and deride the world’s delusions. O you heedless multitude—can you not reflect?}\n\n{Exegesis} This chapter employs allegory. Custom, where it takes root, follows the crowd. What the crowd holds in common, that they deem right. Though entangled in desires from birth to death, drifting without cease in life, ignorant of their destination in death; the foolish toil for food and clothing until their end, the noble toil for fame and form until their death, all believing this to be fate’s decree, as it has been since ancient times. But those who attain the highest learning must seek the Dao, forgetful of life, to unite with the real. Hearing the Way, they put it into practice, regardless of age; exhausting life without awaiting divine response, or moved to spontaneous enlightenment. Thus the *Yijing* says: “Abiding in stillness, yet moved to spontaneous penetration”—then the obstructions of form may be forgotten, and the principle of perfect equilibrium flows freely.\n\nThe note “fleeting instant” originally read “vast instant”; here it follows the *Daoist Canon* edition. The *Shiwen* reads “ridges” as “mounds,” “reflect” as “reflect upon,” noting: *Lǒng* is pronounced *lì zhǒng*. *Lí* is pronounced *lí*. *Shěn* is pronounced *shì rěn*.\n\nAlas! *Chī* is pronounced *chì zhī qiè*. *Yǔ* is pronounced *yú*.\n\nKuafu overestimated his strength. Bo Jun notes: The *Lüshi Chunqiu*’s \"Seeking the Worthy\" chapter states, “The wilds of Kuafu.” Gao You’s commentary says, “Kuafu is the name of a beast.” Guo Pu’s commentary on the *Classic of Mountains and Seas: The Classic of the Northern Wilderness Beyond the Sea* states, “Kuafu was likely the name of a divine being.” The *Huainanzi*’s \"Treatise on Terrain\" says, “Kuafu’s ears lie to its north (the character *qǔ* follows Wang Niansun’s emendation). Kuafu discarded his staff, and it became Deng Forest.” Gao You’s commentary: “Kuafu was a divine beast. *Dèng* means ‘wood.’ Another saying: a transcendent.” The *Shiwen* states: *Kuā* is pronounced *kǒu huā qiè*. *Fù* is pronounced *fǔ*. The *Classic of the Great Wilderness* says: “There was a man who wore two yellow serpents as earrings and grasped two yellow serpents, named Kuafu. He wished to pursue the sun’s shadow and chased it to the edge of Yu Valley.” [Annotation] Yu Valley is Yuyuan, where the sun sets. Thirsty and desiring drink, he rushed to drink from the Yellow and Wei Rivers. The Yellow and Wei Rivers were insufficient, so he set off north to drink from the Great Marsh. Before arriving, he died of thirst on the way. He cast aside his staff, and where his corpse’s fat and flesh soaked the ground, Deng Forest grew. The *Shiwen* states: *Jìn* is pronounced *zǐ jìn qiè*. Deng Forest spread vast, spanning thousands of *li*. [Annotation] The *Classic of Mountains and Seas* says, “Kuafu died, discarded his staff, and it became Deng Forest.” [Exegesis] When a person wholly devotes himself to seeking the Dao, he departs from existence to unite with the real. But if one relies on ability to seek victory, he chases shadows yet never catches them. When he unites with the real, form is entirely leveled; when he pursues the superficial, he loses his life and leaves traces. The manifestation of traces gives rise to Deng Forest; the union with the real levels mounds and ridges.\n\nWang Shumin says: The *Cao Tang Shi Jian Bu Yi*, *Ji Zuan Yuan Hai*, and *Shi Wen Lei Ju* all omit the two characters “Deng Forest,” which may be superfluous.\n\nYu the Great said: “Within the Six Directions and the Four Seas, all is illuminated by the sun and moon, ordered by the stars, regulated by the four seasons, and governed by Jupiter. Bo Jun notes: Jupiter is the planet Jupiter. Jupiter’s orbital period is 11.86 years; the ancients mistakenly believed it to be twelve years. Thus, they divided the zodiac into twelve stations, through which it passed once each year, hence ‘governed by Jupiter.’ *Yào* means ‘to bind.’” The *Shiwen* reads “Jupiter” as “Great Year,” stating: *Yào* is pronounced *yī yáo qiè*. *Dà* is pronounced *tài*. “Spirits and numina give birth to things of strange forms. Some die young, some live long—only the sage can comprehend their Way.” [Annotation] The sage follows the Dao of Heaven and Earth, accords with the natures of the myriad things, allows them to follow their courses, and comprehends their reversals and sequences, enabling all differences to attain their proper places. Both long and short lives fulfill their allotted spans. Bi Yuan says: *Liezi* directly cites the *Classic of Mountains and Seas: The Classic of the Southern Wilderness Beyond the Sea*. Lu Wenchang says: In the *Daoist Canon* edition, the annotation includes a “de” character after “all.” Wang Shumin says: The *Essentials of Government* quotes the annotation as “comprehends their reversals,” corresponding to the above “allows them to follow their courses.”\n\nXia Ge said: “Yet there are also those who are born without awaiting spirits and numina, take form without awaiting yin and yang, shine without awaiting the sun and moon, [Annotation] Those who are born do so of themselves; those who take form do so of themselves; those who shine do so of themselves. Suddenly, spontaneously, they are thus—inherently without reliance or borrowing. die young without awaiting slaughter, live long without awaiting nurture, [Annotation] Those who die young do so not through calamity; those who live long do so not through care. eat without awaiting the five grains, clothe themselves without awaiting silk and floss,” The *Shiwen* states: *Zēng* is pronounced *sì líng qiè*. *Kuàng* is pronounced *kuàng*. “travel without awaiting boats and carriages,” The *Shiwen* states: *Chē* is pronounced *jū*. “Their Way is spontaneous, [Annotation] The spontaneous is entirely without reliance. not something the sage can comprehend.” [Annotation] The sage does not oppose the spontaneous, and the myriad things move of themselves. How could he delight in comprehending things? All the above from this chapter is what Xia Ge told Tang of Yin. [Exegesis] The moving forms of things each have their proper place; the sage can accord with their arising to comprehend their Way. Yet the numinous consciousness is supremely subtle, requiring nothing, not dependent on the nurturing of the multitude of existents. It moves alone, spontaneously—how could the sage comprehend it?\n\nThe annotation “above” in the *Daoist Canon* edition reads “the above.”\n\nWhen Yu governed the waters and lands, he became lost and strayed from his path, erring in one state. [Annotation] One who roams beyond the farthest bounds is beyond the reach of deliberate thought, hence the metaphor of being lost and erring. Lu Wenchang says: The annotation’s “also” in the *Daoist Canon* edition reads “only.” He reached the north of the Northern Sea, not knowing how many thousands or tens of thousands of *li* distant from the Central States. [Annotation] *Jù* means “distance.” Lu Wenchang says: The annotation’s “distance” in the *Daoist Canon* edition reads “to.” The state was named Zhongbei. [Exegesis] Zhongbei means its utmost seclusion and subtlety, the land of profound stillness. No one knows where its boundaries align, The *Shiwen* states: *Qí* is pronounced *zǐ xì qiè*. without wind, rain, frost, or dew, and no birds, beasts, insects, fish, grasses, or trees are born there. All four directions are level, encircled by towering ridges. [Annotation] The layered ranges of mountains. [Exegesis] The land of profound stillness has no boundaries; wind, rain, birds, and beasts—the movements of the multitude—do not reach it. Within it, all is utterly level. Towering ridges are the obstructions of form. Wang Chongmin says: The annotation’s “layered ranges” should read “layered folds,” a scribal error. The *Erya*’s “Explaining Mountains” says, “A mountain with three folds is called *zhì*.”\n\nGuo’s annotation: “*Xí* also means ‘layered.’” The *Shiwen* states: The *Erya* says, “*Qiáo* means high and curved.” It also says, “A mountain with three *xí* is called *zhì*.” Guo Pu notes: “Layered ridges.” At the center of the land stands a mountain named Húlǐng. Wang Shumin says: The *Taiping Yulan* (58) and *Tianzhong Ji* (9) both omit the repeated “mountain,” suggesting it may be superfluous. Its shape resembles a *dān*—[Annotation] *dān*: a carrying pole. *—* and *zhuì*. [Annotation] *zhuì*: a mallet. The *Shiwen* states: *Dān* is pronounced *dīng gān*; *zhuì* is pronounced *zhí wéi*. *Dānzhuì* refers to earthen jars. At its summit is an opening shaped like a circular ring, called the Zī Cavern. [The *Shide Tang* edition mistakenly writes “” instead of “穴.”] The *Taiping Yulan* (490) correctly preserves “穴.” From it, water gushes forth, called the Divine Fèn—[Annotation] A spring at a mountain’s summit is called *fèn*. The *Shiwen* states: *Fèn* is pronounced *fǔ wèn*. Guo Pu notes: “In present-day Fenyin of Hedong, there is a body of water, roughly the size of a cartwheel at its center, bubbling and surging from the depths, bottomless, called *fèn*.” *Fén* is pronounced with the rising tone of *fén*. Its fragrance surpasses orchid and pepper, its flavor surpasses unstrained wine. [Exegesis] The mountain symbolizes the mind; the water, the function of wisdom—this is what the spirit wells forth. The *Shiwen* states: *Jiāo* (pepper) is pronounced *jiāo*; *láolǐ* (unstrained wine) is pronounced *láo lǐ*. A single source divides into four channels, flowing down the mountain. [Annotation] Water flowing down a mountain is called *liè*. The *Shiwen* states: *Liè* is pronounced *liè*. It nourishes the entire land, leaving nothing untouched. [Exegesis] It flows through the four limbs, permeates the hundred parts of the body, and circulates throughout the realm of form. The *Shiwen* states: *Wáng* is pronounced *wú*, as below. The soil’s *qi* is harmonious, and there is no plague or premature death. The *Shiwen* states: *Zhá* is pronounced *zhá rù*; *zhá lì* means death by epidemic. The people’s nature is gentle and yielding to things. They neither contend nor compete. Their hearts are soft and their bones weak; they are neither arrogant nor envious. Young and old dwell together. The *Shiwen* states: *Zhǎng* is pronounced *zhāng zhàng*; *chái* is pronounced *shì jiē*. They have no rulers or subjects. Men and women wander freely, without matchmakers or betrothal. The *Shiwen* writes “聘” as “娉,” pronounced *pìn*. They dwell along the water, neither plowing nor sowing. The soil’s *qi* is warm and agreeable; they neither weave nor wear clothes. They die at a hundred years, neither prematurely nor from illness. Their people multiply abundantly without count. The *Shiwen* states: *Zī* means to multiply; *fù* means flourishing. They know joy but no sorrow, no aging, no grief or suffering. [Exegesis] The hundred bones and nine orifices respond to things in use. They neither contend nor compete, nor do they boast or vaunt. They embrace both yin and yang, moving with the turning of the seasons. Their Way is supremely yielding; they neither clothe nor feed themselves. Neither aging nor death pursues them, nor are they bound by short or long lives. If a superior person diligently cultivates this, they may reach this land.\n\nYu Yue remarked: \"The phrase *'zīfù'* ('multiplying and flourishing') likely belongs above 'joy and delight,' thus: *'Their people are without count, multiplying and flourishing in joy and delight, without aging or sorrow, grief or suffering.'* For 'aging' is set against 'flourishing,' and 'grief and suffering' against 'joy and delight.' Their customs delight in sound—*hào* pronounced as *hūbào*—and they join hands to sing in alternation—*dié* pronounced as *zhí*, *yáo* as *yáo*—their voices ceaseless all day long. When hungry or weary, they drink the divine *fèn*, *juàn* pronounced as *juàn*, and their strength and spirit become harmonious and peaceful. If they overindulge, they grow drunk, and only after ten days do they awaken. Bathing in the divine *fèn*, their skin takes on a lustrous sheen, and their fragrance lingers for ten days before fading.\n\n[Exegesis] Humans live by *qi*, hence their love of sound. Their inhalations and exhalations never cease, thus it is said they never stop singing. Drinking and eating true wisdom, free from stray thoughts, they become drunk. When awareness stirs, they bathe again in its midst, hence their radiant fragrance. When King Mu of Zhou traveled north and passed through their land, he forgot to return for three years. After returning to the Zhou court, he longed for their country and felt lost in himself.\"\n\nThe *Shiwen* notes: *chǎng* pronounced as *liǎng*. They do not consume wine or meat, nor do they summon consorts or attendants, and only after several months do they return to their former state.\n\n[Exegesis] King Mu of Zhou had also once visited their land, yet he could not remain there indefinitely, hence it is said he \"returned to his former state.\" Bo Jun notes: The preceding passage states \"after returning to the Zhou court,\" thus \"not consuming wine or meat\" refers to affairs after his return. Here, \"returned to his former state\" means resuming his usual ways—consuming wine and meat, summoning consorts and attendants. The exegesis fails to grasp this.\n\nThe *Shiwen* reads \"nǎi\" as \"nǎi,\" noting: *shù*, pronounced as *sè zhǔ*. *Nǎi* is the ancient form of *nǎi*. Guan Zhong urged Duke Huan of Qi to journey to Liaokou and together visit that land, nearly succeeding in the endeavor.\n\n[Exegesis] Guan Zhong was able to persuade him to go there, hence it is said \"journey to Liaokou.\" Yet they wished to go but could not reach it, thus it is said they \"nearly succeeded.\" The *Shiwen* notes: *jī*, pronounced as *jì*.\n\nXi Peng remonstrated, as the *Shiwen* notes: *xí* pronounced as *xí*: \"My lord, why abandon the vastness of the state of Qi, its teeming populace, its majestic mountains and rivers, its abundance of resources, its flourishing rites and virtue, its splendid robes and regalia? With enchanting beauties filling your courts and loyal ministers crowding your halls, when you roar, a million soldiers stand ready; when you gesture, the feudal lords obey your command. Why then yearn for that land and forsake the altars of Qi’s soil and grain to follow a land of barbarians? This is the dotage of our revered minister—how could you heed him?\"\n\n[Exegesis] The common gentleman of the world speaks only of the people, rites, regalia, and sensual pleasures—this is what they deem noble and true to their nature. The *Shiwen* notes: *fù* pronounced as *fǔ*; *mào*, pronounced as *mào bào*.\n\nDuke Huan desisted and relayed Xi Peng’s words to Guan Zhong. Zhong replied: \"This is truly beyond Peng’s understanding. The *Shiwen* notes: *wěi*, pronounced as *yú guǐ*. I fear that land is unknowable.\" Yu Yue notes: Zhang’s commentary states, \"That land is simply unattainable.\" Thus, \"unknowable\" means \"unattainable.\" The *Lüshi Chunqiu*’s \"Shenying\" chapter reads: \"It lies with the people, yet the lord does not know.\" Gao’s commentary says, \"‘Know’ means ‘attain,’\" which aligns with this meaning. Below, it states: \"What Boya thought of, Zhong Ziqi always grasped\"—here, \"grasped\" means \"knew.\" The meanings of \"know\" and \"grasp\" are closely related. Wang Chongmin notes: The *Taiping Yulan* (490) cites \"know\" as \"ascend,\" which accords with Zhang’s commentary.\n\nThe *Shiwen* notes: *kǒng*, pronounced in the falling tone. \"Why cling to Qi’s wealth? Why heed Xi Peng’s words?\" Zhang’s commentary: That land is simply unattainable—would we desist merely because of Peng’s words?\n\n[Exegesis] What Xi Peng understood did not extend to this. Guan Zhong said: From what I have heard, I only fear it may not be as the legends claim. Thus, he said he feared it was \"unknowable.\" If what is examined matches the legends, and one could go and reach it, then why cling to the worldly allure of sensuality and wealth? Why heed rites, virtue, loyalty, or goodness?\n\nThe people of the southern lands shave their heads and go naked. Zhang’s commentary: *luǒ*, pronounced as *lì guǒ*. The commentary in various editions omits the character \"反,\" which has been restored here following the Yuan edition and the Shide Tang edition. The *Shiwen* notes: *zhù*, pronounced as *zhī liù*. Kong Anguo’s commentary on the *Shangshu* states: *Zhù* means to sever the hair. The *Hanshu* states: The people of Yue cut their hair and tattoo their bodies to avoid harm from dragons. One edition reads *bèi* (to wear), which is likely an error.\n\nThe *Shiwen* notes: *luǒ*, pronounced as *hū wǎ*, meaning they do not cover their bodies with clothing. The people of the northern lands wear felt caps and fur garments. The *Shiwen* notes: *hé* pronounced as *mò*. The *Fangyan* states: Common folk *□* their heads—this refers to *qiāo* headwear. *□* headwear is also called *qiāo* headwear. *□* is also written as *hé*, and also as *□*.\n\n□, pronounced as *wáng bā*. *Qiāo*, pronounced as *qī xiāo*. The people of the Central States wear caps and robes. The resources of the Nine Lands vary: some till the soil, some trade, some hunt, some fish; like winter furs and summer linen, boats for water and carts for land. They attain these naturally, forming them by instinct.\n\nThe annotation states: The resources of each region arise from natural ability. Thus, the people of Wu and Yue use boats, while those of Yan and Shu ride horses, adapting to the suitability of water and land without needing instruction from the wise. Shen Dao said: \"Those who control water use thatch to block and dredge, and though they dwell among the Yi and Mo, their methods are as uniform as one. They learn from water itself, not from Yu.\"\n\nThe *Shiwen* notes: *cí*, pronounced as *jí yí*. *Mò* is pronounced as *mò*. To the east of Yue lies the state of Zhémù. In the Northern Song edition, \"Zhé\" is written as □, which Wang’s edition follows, though no such character exists in dictionaries. Here, it is corrected following the Zang edition. The Shide Tang edition writes \"mù\" as \"mù,\" and the annotation \"xiū\" as \"kāng.\" Qin Enfu said: *Mozi* writes it as \"□mù,\" *Taiping Guangji* as \"kǎi mù,\" and *Xinlun* as \"zhěn mù.\" Yang Bojun notes: *Bowuzhi* writes it as \"hài mù.\" The *Shiwen* writes \"mù\" as \"xiū,\" stating: *Zhé* in the *Shuowen* is written as *yì*, pronounced *zhū shè*, meaning pendulous ears. *Xiū* means beauty, likely referring to those with dangling ears. Other texts writing it as □mù are in error.\n\nWhen their eldest son is born, they butcher and eat him. Lu Wenchang said: \"Xiān\" should be understood as flaying. *Mozi*’s *Lu Wen* chapter writes \"xiān ér shí zhī,\" matching *Liezi*, while its *Jie Zang* chapter writes \"jiě ér shí zhī,\" showing that *xiān* and *jiě* are the same. The *Liji*’s *Yue Ling* states: \"In late summer, if spring ordinances are followed, grain will be *xiān luò*,\" while *Lüshi Chunqiu* writes it as \"*jiě luò*,\" further proof. He also said: *Xiān* and *xī* are phonetic shifts, so \"*xī zhī*\" is also written as \"*xiān zhī*,\" and *Mozi* likewise uses *xiān*. Wang Zhong said: *Xiān* means to split, a phonetic shift. Zhongfu said: *Xiān* should be glossed as *xī* (to split). *Lüshi Chunqiu*’s *Bao Geng* chapter states: \"Zhao Meng saw a starving man under a mulberry tree and gave him a piece of dried meat, saying, '*Sī* shí zhī.'\" The meaning of \"*xiān ér shí zhī*\" is identical to \"*sī shí zhī*,\" as *sī* and *xiān* share both sound and meaning in antiquity. Wang Chongmin said: *Xiān* has no meaning of flaying; Lu’s interpretation is incorrect. *Xiān* is likely a corruption of *jiě*. In vulgar script, *jiě* may be written with *yáng* as 解, and characters with *yú* are prone to corruption into those with *jiǎo*. In *Shiji*’s *Biography of Jia Yi*, \"*xì gù jiè jì xī*\" is corrupted into \"*xì gù □ jì xī*.\" The *Jing Jun Inscription* of the Han reads \"*yuán yuán guān guǎ*,\" with *guān* corrupted into □. The *Er Ya*’s *Shi Shan* states: \"Small mountains are *bié*, large mountains are *xiān*.\" The *Shiwen* notes: \"*Xiān* may also be written as □.\" Li Shan’s commentary on *Wen Xuan*’s *Wu Du Fu* cites the *Er Ya* as writing it *xiè*. *Zhuangzi*’s *Ren Jian Shi* reads: \"*cuò zhēn zhì xiè*,\" with the *Shiwen* noting: \"Cui’s edition writes it □.\" All are evidence of the interchange between *xiān* and *jiě*. Thus, *Mozi*’s *Lu Wen* writing *xiān* and *Jie Zang* writing *jiě* shows the former is corrupted. *Yue Ling* writing *xiān* and *Lüshi Chunqiu* writing *jiě* (as does *Huainanzi*’s *Shi Ze* chapter: \"*gǔ shí jiě luò*\") shows *Yue Ling* is also corrupted. *Liezi*’s use of *xiān* follows the same pattern. Lu’s attempt to reconcile them is thus mistaken.\n\nYang Bojun notes: Wang’s argument follows Sun Yirang’s *Mozi Jian Gu*’s citation of Gu Jun’s theory, but *xiān* is inherently intelligible and need not be emended. *Bowuzhi* writes it as \"*jiě ér shí zhī*.\"\n\nThe *Shiwen* notes: *zhǎng*, pronounced as *dīng zhàng*. Du Yu’s commentary on the *Zuozhuan* states: Those who do not die of old age are called *xiān*, meaning young. Yang Bojun notes: Du Yu’s commentary on *Zuozhuan*’s *Zhao Gong Wu Nian* (\"those buried young exit through the West Gate\") states: \"Those who do not die of old age are called *xiān*.\" Kong Yingda’s *Zhengyi* glosses it as \"young,\" which is the basis for Jing Shun’s note, though he does not clarify it further. This is called *yí dì*.\n\nTheir great-grandfather having died, they carried their great-grandmother away and abandoned her, saying: \"A ghost’s wife cannot dwell together.\" Lu Wenchang notes: In the *Zang* edition, \"以\" is written as \"与.\" Wang Chongmin states: The *Guangya* reads: \"以, with.\" The ancient character *以* is interchangeable with *与*; for details, see *Shici*. \"Cannot dwell together\" means \"cannot dwell together with her.\" The *Mozi*’s *Jiezang* chapter writes it as \"与,\" as do the Northern Song edition and the Jifu edition.\n\nSouth of Chu lies the Land of the *Yan* People. Lu Wenchang notes: In the *Mozi*’s *Jiezang* chapter, \"炎\" is written as \"啖.\" Sun Yirang states: The *Luwen* chapter also writes \"啖人,\" as does the *Xinlun*; the *Bowuzhi* cites it as \"炎,\" and the *Hou Hanshu* likewise writes \"啖人国.\" It is likely that \"啖\" is correct. The *Shiwen* writes \"炎人\" as \"啖人,\" noting: *啖* is pronounced with a departing tone, originally written as *炎.*\n\nWhen their kin die—Qian Daxin notes: The ancients referred to parents as *kin*; the *Da Dai Liji*’s *Zengzi Jibing* chapter states: \"When kin have passed, though one wishes to be filial, to whom can one be filial?\" The *Mengzi*’s *Jinxin* chapter reads: \"Nothing is greater for a person than the loss of kin, ruler, minister, superior, or inferior\"—they carve away the flesh and discard it. The Shide Tang edition omits the character \"之\" after \"弃.\" The *Shiwen* notes: *□* is originally written as *呙*, pronounced *guǎ*, meaning to strip flesh. It is also pronounced *xiǔ.* Wang Chongmin states: The *Shiwen*’s alternate version writes *呙*, likely a corruption of *呙.* The *Shuowen*’s *呙* section reads: \"*呙*: to strip flesh from a person and set aside the bones,\" which is its meaning. Yang Bojun notes: The *Bowuzhi* also writes \"朽其肉而弃之,\" and the *Taiping Yulan* (790) cites \"刳\" for \"朽,\" likely following the *Liezi.* Only after burying the bones is one deemed a filial son.\n\nThe *Shiwen* notes: *乃* is the ancient form of *乃.*\n\nWest of Qin lies the state of the *Yiqu*—also called *Kang.* The *Shiwen* notes: *渠* is pronounced *qú.*\n\nWhen their kin die, they gather brushwood and pile it to burn them. The *Zang* edition and the Shide Tang edition write \"祡\" as \"柴.\" The *Shiwen* notes: *祡* is pronounced *chái.* The *Shuowen* reads: \"To burn brushwood and offer it as sacrifice to the celestial spirits.\" It is sometimes interchangeable with *柴.* *积* is pronounced *zì*, meaning to gather. Ren Dachun states: The *Shiwen* on the *Shijing*’s *Shimai* chapter notes: \"*Cháiwàng*: the *Shuowen* and *Zilin* write it as *祡*.\" The *Shiwen* on the *Liji*’s *Wangzhi* chapter reads: \"*Dàizōng chái*: following the character, it is written as *祡*.\" The *Shiwen* on the *Erya*’s *Shitian* chapter states: \"*Chái*: the *Shuowen* writes it as *祡*.\" The *Shiji*’s *Five Emperors* chapter reads: \"*Dàizōng chái*.\" The *Han Li Ziyuan*’s *Fan Yi Xiu Hua Yue Bei* writes \"柴\" as \"祡,\" which can be mutually verified with the *Shiwen.*\n\nWhen the smoke rises, it is called *ascending to the distant.* Tao Hongqing states: Having already said *gather*, to say *pile* is redundant. *积* should be a loan for *箦.* The *Shijing*’s *Weifeng* reads: \"Green bamboo like *箦*,\" with the *Mao* commentary: \"accumulated.\" *箦* and *积* share sound and meaning, and by example may be used interchangeably. The *Shuowen* reads: \"*箦*: bed matting.\" Zhu Junsheng takes *箦* as a general term for woven mats. The *Shiji*’s *Fan Sui Liezhuan* reads: \"Fan Sui feigned death, then was rolled in *箦*.\" The *Suoyin* notes: \"*箦* refers to thin reeds.\" \"Gathering brushwood and *箦* to burn them\" means piling brushwood as a mat to facilitate burning. \"When the smoke rises, it is called *ascending to the distant*\" means that when one sees the smoke rising, it is called *ascending to the distant.* *则* is equivalent to *而*; for details, see Wang’s *Jingzhuan Shi Ci.* Wang Shumin states: In the *Liezi*, *登遐* is written as *升霞* in the *Xinlun*, with *升* correctly written as *升* (ascend). *登* is thus *升.* *登霞* means they have become immortals. *遐* is a loan for *霞.* In this book’s *Huangdi* chapter, \"而帝登假,\" *假* is also a loan for *霞.* The *Huainanzi*’s *Qisu* chapter reads: \"Those who cannot ride clouds and *ascend to the distant* are clearly incapable.\" \"*Ascend to the distant*\" is paired with \"*ride clouds*,\" showing that \"*ascend to the distant*\" is \"*登霞*.\" The *Chuci*’s *Yuanyou* reads: \"Carrying my spirit and *ascending to the distant*,\" using the original character. Only then is one deemed a filial son.\n\nThis is taken as governance above and custom below, yet it is not considered strange.\n\n[Note] This matter is also recorded in the *Mozi.*\n\n[Explanation] What the multitude deems right becomes correct; what they practice becomes customary. Thus, the most correct and most common things go unquestioned. Those who follow custom are many—how would they know the ultimate principle? Yang Bojun notes: This passage in the *Liezi* is identical to the *Bowuzhi.* The current *Bowuzhi* is certainly not Zhang Hua’s original work, but since the *Liezi* was forged between the late Western Jin and early Eastern Jin, it may have plagiarized the *Bowuzhi.*\n\nConfucius traveled east and saw two children arguing. The *Shiwen* notes: *斗* is pronounced *dòu.*\n\nHe asked the reason. One child said: \"I believe that when the sun first rises, it is closer to people, and at midday, it is farther away.\" The other child believed that at sunrise, it was farther, and at midday, closer. Yu Yue states: After \"儿,\" the characters \"曰我\" should be added to match the structure of the preceding sentence. Yang Bojun notes: The *Shilei Fu*’s *Tian* section (3), the *Taiping Yulan* (3 and 385), and other sources include the characters \"曰我,\" while the *Yiwen Leiju* (1) includes \"曰\" but omits \"我,\" supporting Yu’s argument.\n\nOne child said: \"At sunrise, the sun is as large as a carriage canopy.\" Wang Chongmin states: The *Yilin*, *Chuxue Ji* (1), and *Taiping Yulan* (3) all write \"车盖\" as \"车轮.\"\n\nThe *Taiping Yulan* (3) also includes the five characters \"曰尔何以知\" (\"said: 'How do you know?'\") before \"一儿.\" Wang Shumin states: The *Tianzhong Ji* (1) likewise includes the five characters \"曰尔何以知\" before \"一儿,\" while the *Shilei Fu* (1, *Tian* section) includes the six characters \"曰尔何以知之\" (\"said: 'How do you know this?'\"). \"车盖\" is also written as \"车轮.\" The *Yunfu Qunyu* (18) also writes it as \"车轮.\" \"And at midday, it is like a plate or basin: is this not because what is far appears small, and what is near appears large?\"\n\nYang Bojun notes: Here, \"盘\" should refer to a food vessel, not a wooden utensil.\n\nOne child said: \"At sunrise, it is chilly and cool.\" The *Shiwen* notes: \"沧\" is written as \"怆\" in one version, with the gloss: \"怆, *chū liáng* cut, also written as *cāng*.\" The *Zhou Shu* states: \"Between heaven and earth, there is *chuàng* heat; those who skillfully apply the Dao never exhaust it.\" Kong Yingda reads it as *cháo.* The *Zilin* states: \"凉 means slightly cold.\" Ren Dachun notes: The *Shuowen* and *Guangya* define *cāng* as cold. The *Xinlun* by Huan Tan also records this matter as *chuàng liáng.* The *Xunzi* (\"Zhengming\" chapter) states: \"Swiftly alternating between cold and heat.\" Yang Liang’s commentary: \"*Cāng* means cold.\" Thus, the character for cold is written as *cāng.* The *Liezi* writes \"怆怆叙叙\"; if we seek the meaning of *xùxù*, then \"怆怆\" should be \"凔凔.\" The current edition of the *Yi Zhou Shu* (\"Taizi Jin\" chapter) reads: \"Between heaven and earth, there is *cāng* heat.\" Kong Chao’s commentary: \"*Cāng* means cold.\" It is also written as *cāng*, not *chuàng*, matching the current edition of the *Liezi.* Only the *Shiwen* cites the *Yi Zhou Shu* as \"怆热.\" Could Lu Deming’s old edition have read *chuàng* instead of *cāng*? The use of \"怆怆\" for \"凔凔\" is a loan character.\n\nYang Bojun notes: The *Shuowen* (*冫* section) states: \"*Cāng* means cold.\" The *Shui* section states: \"*Cāng* means cold.\" *Cāng* and *chuàng* share the same pronunciation and meaning, suggesting they are the same character. Thus, the *Jiyun* states: \"*Cāng* means cold, sometimes written with the water radical.\" Zhu Junsheng’s claim that *cāng* originally referred to a river name seems arbitrary.\n\n\"And at midday, it is like boiling water: is this not because what is near is hot, and what is far is cool?\" Wang Chongmin states: The character \"日\" is superfluous. \"其\" refers to the sun; if \"日\" were included, the phrasing would be redundant. The *Yiwen Leiju* (1), *Chuxue Ji* (1), and *Taiping Yulan* (3) all omit \"日,\" confirming this. Wang Shumin states: The *Fayuan Zhulin* (7), *Shilei Fu* (1), *Taiping Yulan* (385), and *Yunfu Qunyu* (58) also omit \"日.\" The *Yilin* and *Jinxiu Wanhua Gu* (1) omit even \"其.\" It is likely that one edition wrote \"日\" as \"其,\" and later transcriptions mistakenly included both.\n\nThe *Shiwen* notes: *Wei* (為) is pronounced *yú wěi* cut, and the same applies below.\n\nConfucius could not decide. The two children laughed and said: \"Who says you are so knowledgeable?\"\n\n**Annotation:** This refers to what lies beyond the six directions, which the sage acknowledges but does not discuss. The two children’s laughter may not have been ignorant; perhaps they mutually inspired one another.\n\n**Exegesis:** The sage’s life is valued for illuminating the Dao. When successful, they aid the world; when obstructed, they cultivate themselves. Self-cultivation means nurturing the Dao to preserve authenticity; aiding the world means establishing teachings to benefit others. If advancement does not fully embody the Dao, and retreat does not benefit life, then partial arguments are not what the sage expounds. Not deciding is not due to ignorance. Ordinary people assume that asking without knowing is foolish, while the sage refrains from debate because it is unproductive. If all matters—whether reasonable or not—were debated, the sage’s futile labor would indeed be great. Thus, the two children’s dispute could have been resolved. Why was it not?\n\nWhen the sun first rises, its light does not yet reach far, and those standing beyond its glow perceive it as large. When the sun is at its zenith, its light suffuses all things, and those within its glow perceive its true form. This is like gazing at a candle’s flame from afar—it appears larger; yet when viewed up close, the flame seems smaller. Such is the principle of things—what benefit is there in debating it?\n\nWang Chongmin notes: The *Leiju*, *Chuxue Ji*, and *Taiping Yulan* all quote this passage with *wei* (為) written as *wei* (謂). The two characters were interchangeable in ancient script.\n\nBo Jun’s note: On August 15, 1955, the *Guangming Daily*’s Science Supplement published an article by Dai Wensai titled *\"Is the Sun Closer to Us at Noon Than in the Morning or Evening?\"*, appended here in full:\n\n*\"Is the sun closer to us at noon or in the morning and evening? Legend holds that Confucius once encountered two people debating this, each with their own reasoning. Those who argued the sun was closer at noon cited the greater heat of midday sunlight, while those who claimed it was closer in the morning and evening pointed to its larger apparent size then. Confucius could not settle the dispute. From a modern scientific perspective, neither argument holds. The sun’s larger appearance at dawn and dusk is an optical illusion, while the greater heat at noon results from direct sunlight traveling a shorter path through the atmosphere, with less heat absorbed. So how should we answer this question? First, we must clarify why the sun’s distance appears to vary between noon and morning or evening. Several factors contribute:\n1. The Earth is spherical and rotates continuously. If it had no other motion and its axis were perpendicular to the line between the Earth and the sun, observers at the equator would always find the sun closer at noon—by a distance equal to Earth’s radius (6,400 km).\n2. Observers are not necessarily at the equator. The greater the latitude (the farther from the equator), the smaller the difference in the sun’s distance between noon and morning or evening.\n3. The Earth not only rotates but also revolves around the sun, with its rotational axis tilted 23.5 degrees relative to its orbital axis. The direction of this axis changes very slowly, causing the sun’s midday height in the sky to vary throughout the year.\n4. The Earth’s orbit is elliptical, so the distance between the Earth’s center and the sun’s center changes daily.\n5. Sunrise and sunset times vary throughout the year, and on the same day, they differ by latitude.\n6. Due to the slow shift in the Earth’s rotational axis and the gravitational influence of other planets on its orbit, the date when the Earth and sun are closest is not fixed. Currently, this occurs on January 2, though it shifts 17.5 days later every 1,000 years.\n\nConsidering these factors, we can derive formulas to calculate the difference in the sun’s distance from an observer at noon versus morning or evening. The necessary data can be found in astronomical almanacs. The results are as follows: For a latitude of 40° north (e.g., Beijing), the sun is currently farther at noon than at sunrise from January 22 to June 5 each year—by 1,000 km in early February, 4,000 km in early March, and up to 6,400 km in early April, after which the difference diminishes to zero. After June 5, the sun is closer at noon than at sunrise—by 5,800 km in early July and up to 16,000 km by mid-September, before the difference again decreases until the following January 22. The difference between noon and evening is quite different: from August 1 to December 15, the sun is farther at noon than at evening, while for the remaining seven and a half months, it is closer—by up to 17,000 km in mid-April. Outside the Arctic and Antarctic Circles, the year can be divided into four periods:\n1. From December 15 to January 22 (38 days), the sun is closer at noon than in the morning or evening.\n2. From January 23 to June 4 (134 days), the sun is farther at noon than in the morning but closer than in the evening.\n3. From June 5 to August 1 (57 days), the sun is again closer at noon than in the morning or evening.\n4. From August 2 to December 14 (136 days), the sun is closer at noon than in the morning but farther than in the evening.\"*\n\nAt the transition points between these four periods, the sun at noon is equidistant as at sunrise (January 22 and June 15) or equidistant as at sunset (August 1 and December 15). These four transition points vary with latitude. The higher the latitude, the longer the first and third periods become, while the other two periods shorten. Conditions in the Southern Hemisphere are nearly symmetrical to those in the Northern Hemisphere, except that at 40° south latitude, the first period (54 days) is longer than the third (41 days)—the opposite of the pattern at 40° north latitude. The above calculations were made for the year 1954. However, due to the minimal influence of the sixth factor over short durations, the results remain valid for the next 100 years.\n\nThus, all phenomena must be explained through science to be correct.\n\n**Additional Note:** The *Lunheng* in its \"Discourse on the Sun\" states: \"Some Confucians claim that the sun is nearer at dawn and dusk when it rises and sets, and farther at noon. Those who argue that the sun is nearer at sunrise and sunset and farther at noon do so because the sun appears larger at those times and smaller at noon. Others contend that the sun is farther at sunrise and sunset and nearer at noon because it feels warmer at noon and colder at dawn and dusk. Both arguments have their merits and flaws, leaving no definitive resolution to the matter.\" This may have been the source for the spurious *Liezi*. The current edition of the *Bowuzhi* also records this, adding that \"it is also found in the *Liezi*,\" which aligns with the *Siku Quanshu* *Bowuzhi* précis' observation that it was compiled by meddlers who pieced together passages from the *Liezi* and other texts.\n\nAnother annotation cites the phrase *\"Beyond the six directions, the sage preserves but does not discuss\"*—the line *\"Beyond the six directions\"* appears in the *Zhuangzi*'s \"Discourse on Equalizing Things.\" *\"Equality is the supreme principle under heaven.\"* [Annotation:] When all things and affairs are balanced and equal, the principle is perfectly realized. This applies even to physical objects. [Annotation:] *\"Connected\"* means attached. Even objects must be balanced. The *Shiwen* notes: *\"Connected\"* is read as *zhu* (音烛), with the same pronunciation below.\n\n*\"When hair is evenly suspended and evenly weighted, it snaps due to imbalance—unevenness causes it to break.\"* [Annotation:] Hair is extremely fine and fragile, yet it does not break when perfectly balanced. The reason it snaps now is because, like weights tilting unevenly, there is imbalance. Wang Shumin remarks: The second *\"hair\"* character is likely a superfluous repetition from the line above. Lin Xiyi’s *Kouyi* reads: *\"Thus it is said, ‘It snaps due to imbalance—unevenness causes it to break,’\"* suggesting his edition lacked the second *\"hair\"* character. The *Mozi*'s *Canons and Explanations (B)* mirrors this.\n\n*\"If it is balanced, it does not break.\"* [Annotation:] If it were truly balanced, how could it break? *\"It does not break.\"* [Annotation:] It means it does not snap. *\"People deem this incorrect,\"* [Annotation:] Ordinary people do not grasp the principle. *\"Yet there are those who know it to be so.\"* [Annotation:] There are those who understand this principle as true. The *Mozi* also contains this argument.\n\n[Exegesis:] The ultimate principle is that nothing under heaven is unequal; it is not that things become equal only after being balanced. The same applies to physical objects—when aligned with principle, they are naturally balanced. It is like suspending a weight with a hair: though delicate, it does not break. Snapping occurs due to imbalance; balance ensures it does not break. The world dismisses this as untrue, unaware that it is the necessary nature of principle.\n\nZhan He [Annotation:] Zhan He, a man of Chu, was renowned in his state for his skill in fishing. He used a single silkworm’s thread as his line. The *Shiwen* notes: *\"Zhan\"* is read as *Zhan* (音占); *\"cocoon\"* is read as *jian* (古典切). He fashioned a needle of *mang* grass into a hook. Wang Niansun states: *\"Hook\"* originally read *\"fishing\"* (钓), as *\"fishing\"* is synonymous with *\"hook.\"* Modern editions read *\"hook\"* (钩) because later scholars, knowing only that *\"diao\"* (钓) means *\"to fish,\"* were unaware it also serves as an alternate name for *\"hook\"* (钩), thus altering it arbitrarily. The *Liezi*'s \"Tang Wen\" chapter states: *\"Zhan He used a needle of *mang* grass as his hook,\"* but later editors changed *\"fishing\"* (钓) to *\"hook\"* (钩), unaware that the *Taiping Yulan* cites this passage with *\"fishing\"* (钓). Further, in the line *\"casting the line and sinking the hook\"* below, modern editions read *\"hook\"* (钩) instead of *\"fishing\"* (钓), another alteration by later hands. The *Yunfu Qunyu* under the entry for *\"fishing\"* (钓) cites the *Liezi*'s *\"casting the line and sinking the hook,\"* indicating that earlier editions still read *\"fishing\"* (钓). The *Shiwen* notes: *\"Mang needle\"* is read as *wang zhen* (音亡箴). He used a *jing* bamboo as his rod. [Annotation:] The *Daozang*, Yuan, and Shide Tang editions read *\"you\"* (莜) in error. The *Shiwen* notes: *\"Jing\"* is also written as *\"you\"* (莜), originally a *\"tiao\"* (条) character. He split grains for bait. Lu Wenchong notes: The *Daozang* edition reads *\"□\"* instead of *\"grain\"* (粒). The *Shiwen* notes: *\"Split\"* is read as *pou* (片口切); *\"grain\"* is read as *li* (音立). With this, he hauled in fish as large as a cart from abysses a hundred *ren* deep and swift-flowing currents. [Annotation:] The *Jia Yu* states: *\"The kun fish is so vast it fills a cart.\"* The *Shiwen* notes: *\"Swift\"* is read as *gu* (古物切).\n\nThe line remained unbroken, the hook unbent, the rod unbowed.\n\n[Annotation:] Adorning fragrant bait, suspending a delicate hook, sinking into the dark mud below while riding the surging waves above—one follows the water’s flow in casting and retrieving, now yielding, now resisting, rising and falling with it. Only when the fish slackens and the line snaps does one seize the moment to capture it.\n\nBo Jun’s note: From *\"Zhan He\"* onward to this point, the *Bowuzhi* text is entirely identical to this passage. Another note: The *Taiping Yulan* (384) adds seven characters—*\"following the water’s flow in casting and retrieving\"*—after *\"unbowed,\"* likely an erroneous interpolation from the annotation.\n\nThe *Shiwen* notes: *\"Nao\"* (挠) is read *nao xiao* (乃孝切), meaning a bent piece of wood. *\"Er\"* (饵) is read *reng er* (仍耳切). *\"Gua\"* (挂) is read *gua* (音卦). *\"She\"* (舍) is read *she* (音舍). *\"Xie\"* (颉) is read *hu jie* (胡结切), and *\"wan\"* (顽) is read *hu lang* (户郎切).\n\nWhen the King of Chu heard of this, he found it extraordinary and summoned Zhan He to ask the reason. Zhan He replied: \"I have heard my late master say that Pujuzi, the fowler, [Annotation:] Pujuzi was an ancient master of archery and fowling. Bo Jun’s note: The *Hanshu Yiwen Zhi* under the *Ji Qiao* category lists *Pujuzi Yifa* in four *pian*. The *Huainanzi*’s *Lanming Xun* also states: *'Thus Pujuzi could link birds at a hundred* ren *above, just as Zhan He could lure fish from the depths of great abysses.'* Gao You’s commentary notes: *'Pujuzi was a man of Chu skilled in archery and fowling.'* would take a supple bow and fine line, [The *Shiwen* notes: *\"Zhuo\"* (缴) is read *zhuo* (音灼).] ride the wind to launch it—[The *Wen Xuan*’s commentary on Zhang Heng’s *Xijing Fu* and Wang Can’s *Sizi Jiangde Lun* both read: *'ride the wind and launch it.'*]—and bring down a pair of cormorants amid the azure clouds.\" [The *Shiwen* notes: *\"Cang\"* (鸧) is read *cang* (音仓).]\n\nWith mind concentrated and hand movements balanced, I observed his methods and imitated them to learn angling. *[The *Shiwen* notes: *\"Fang\"* (放) is read *fenliang*.]* For five years I began to master its Dao.\n\nWhen I stand by the river holding my rod, my mind is free of distractions, focused solely on the fish. Casting the line and sinking the hook, my hand moves with neither lightness nor heaviness—nothing can disturb it. The fish see my hook and bait as mere sinking dust or gathered foam, swallowing them without hesitation. *[Wang Chongmin notes: The Jifu edition has both instances of \"hook\" (钩) written as \"angling\" (钓), which is correct. \"Angling\" here refers to the hook. Modern editions use \"hook\" because later readers knew only that \"angling\" meant fishing, unaware that it was also an alternate name for \"hook,\" thus altering it arbitrarily. The *Guangya* states: \"Angling is the hook.\" The *Zhuangzi*'s \"Tian Zifang\" chapter reads: \"King Wen observed at Zang and saw an old man angling, yet his angling was no angling—he did not hold his angling as angling, for it was constant angling.\" (Of these six instances of \"angling,\" only the two in \"his angling\" and \"hold his angling\" refer to the hook; the other four are read as the verb \"to angle.\") The *Huainanzi*'s \"Shuoshan\" chapter states: \"Wielding a hook, he ascends the mountain; raising an axe, he enters the abyss.\" The \"Shuolin\" chapter says: \"A hook without bait cannot catch fish.\" Dongfang Shuo’s \"Qi Jian\" reads: \"To use a straight needle as a hook—what fish could be caught?\" All serve as evidence that \"hook\" was written as \"angling.\" The *Yunfu Qunyu* under the entry for \"angling\" cites the *Liezi*: \"Casting the line and sinking the hook,\" showing that the edition it consulted still used \"angling.\" For further discussion, see Wang Niansun’s *Dushu Zazhi Yubian*. (Wang states: \"Zhan He used a needle as his hook; later scholars changed 'angling' to 'hook,' unaware that the *Taiping Yulan* also writes it as 'angling.'\" Note: The Bao edition of the *Taiping Yulan* (834) writes it as \"hook,\" but the original reading as \"angling\" is still preferable.) *[The *Shiwen* notes: *\"Mo\"* (沫) is read *mo* (音末).]*\n\nThus can the weak overcome the strong, and the light attain the heavy. If Your Majesty governs the state with such focus, the realm could be turned as if in the palm of your hand—what further effort would be needed?\"\n\nThe King of Chu said, \"Excellent.\" *[Note: He approved of this analogy, using it to admonish the king’s governance of the state.]*\n\n*[Explanation:] When the sage governs the people, he must first examine the nature of all things and establish teachings to guide them. Then the common folk follow daily without awareness, responding effortlessly. Just as a tiny bait, carried by the current, cannot but be controlled by me—so too does the Daoist nurture life and preserve authenticity, like a supple bow and fine line riding the wind to launch. When the light and living beings incline toward transformation, governing the world follows this same Dao.*\n\nGonghu of Lu and Zhao Qiying of Qi both suffered from illness. *[Bo Jun’s note: The *Gongyang Zhuan* for the thirty-first year of Duke Zhao mentions a Gonghuzi, a senior clansman of Zhu Lou—possibly the same Gonghuzi as in the *Shuo Yuan*’s \"Jian Ben\" chapter. This account is certainly fantastical, though the names may have some basis.] *[The *Shiwen* notes: *\"Hu\"* (扈) is read *hu* (音户).]* Together they sought Bian Que for treatment. *[Yu Yue notes: The text says both \"sought\" and \"requested,\" which is redundant. \"Requested\" is a corruption of \"visited.\" \"Visited\" means \"to go to\"—they went to Bian Que’s place to seek treatment. The following line reads, \"The two declined and returned,\" supporting this.] *[Wang Shumin notes: Yu Yue’s interpretation is incorrect. \"Requested\" here means \"to pay respects.\" The *Shuowen* states: \"To request is to pay respects,\" which fits the context.] *[Bo Jun’s note: The *Taiping Yulan* (376) writes \"requested\" as \"visited,\" but (724) retains \"requested.\"] *[The *Shiwen* notes: *\"Bian\"* (扁) is read *biandian*.]* The *Records of the Grand Historian* states: \"Bian Que was a man of Bohai Commandery, surnamed Qin, given name Yue-ren. Skilled in medicine, he could diagnose illnesses and fully perceive the ailments of the five viscera.\" Bian Que treated them, and both recovered together.\n\nBian Que addressed Gong Hu and Qi Ying, saying: \"The illnesses you previously suffered were external intrusions into the organs and viscera—*Shiwen* notes: *nang* (曩), *nailang* cut; *zang* (藏), *culang* cut, same below—naturally curable by medicinal stones. Now, however, you share a congenital affliction, growing with the body itself—*Shiwen* notes: *zhang* (长), *zhangzhang* cut. What if I were to treat this for you?\"—*Shiwen* notes: *wei* (为), *yuwu* cut.\n\nThe two replied: \"We would first hear of its verification.\" *[Bo Jun’s note: The *Guangya* (*Shigu* 4) states: \"证 (*zheng*) means 譣 (*qian*),\" thus 譣 is also evidence. The ancient character 譣 is interchangeable with 验 (*yan*), meaning verification. Here, 证 should be read as in the *Zhou Muwang* chapter: 'informed his son of the *zheng*,' equivalent to the modern colloquial 症 (*zheng*).]*\n\nBian Que said to Gong Hu: \"Your will is strong but your *qi* is weak, so you are abundant in planning yet deficient in decisiveness.\" *[Annotation: *Zhi* (志) refers to mental acuity; *qi* (气) refers to innate disposition. Excessive intelligence leads to overthinking, while weak nature results in indecision.]*—*Shiwen* notes: *duan* (断), *dingguan* cut, same below.\n\n\"Qi Ying, your will is weak but your *qi* is strong, so you are lacking in deliberation yet prone to obstinacy.\" *[Annotation: With scant wisdom but reliance on nature, one acts resolutely yet self-righteously. The *Daozang* edition includes the character 果 (*guo*, \"bold\") before 敢 (*gan*, \"daring\").]*\n\n\"If I were to exchange your hearts, you would both attain balance in goodness.\"\n\nThereupon, Bian Que gave the two men a toxic draft—*Shiwen* notes: *yin* (饮), *yujin* cut—rendering them unconscious for three days. He then split open their chests, extracted their hearts—*Shiwen* notes: *pou* (剖), *piankou* cut—exchanged and replaced them, and administered a divine remedy. Upon awakening, they were as before.\n\nWang Chongmin notes: The *Taiping Yulan* (chapters 376 and 724) both cite \"悟\" (*wu*, \"awakened\") as \"寤\" (*wu*, \"roused\"). The two men took their leave and departed. Thereupon, Gong Hu returned to Qi Ying’s home and took possession of his wife and children; yet they did not recognize him. Qi Ying likewise returned to Gong Hu’s home and took possession of his wife and children—*Taiping Yulan* (chapter 376) reads: \"而有其妻子\" (\"and took possession of his wife and children\"), with the character \"而\" (*er*, \"and\") preceding \"有\" (*you*, \"took possession\"), matching the structure of the preceding sentence. His wife and children also did not recognize him.\n\n*[Annotation:]* The two men exchanged hearts, altering their fundamental consciousness; thus, each returned to the other’s home. Since neither retained their former appearance, their wives and children failed to recognize them. The two households then brought suit against one another, seeking Bian Que’s judgment to resolve the dispute. Bian Que clarified the cause, and the litigation ceased.\n\n*[Annotation:]* This account is fantastical and rarely found in records. Yet during the Wei dynasty, Hua Tuo was able to excise intestines, replace stomachs, and cleanse the five viscera—there are indeed inexplicable principles in the world that cannot be dismissed by conjecture. Thus, such matters are best preserved without undue speculation.\n\n*[Exegesis:]* The physical form is an insensate thing; the spirit is the sentient master. Abiding in one’s original nature preserves wholeness and aligns with the Dao, while clinging to material form loses one’s nature and follows mere emotion. Common people see only the body’s likes and dislikes, unaware that the spirit governs. The present account of exchanging hearts and each claiming the other’s wife and children demonstrates that the heart directs emotion, while the body is truly insensate. This is why the Daoist values the cultivation of spirit.\n\n*Shiwen* notes: *hua* (华), *huchua* cut; *ta* (他), pronounced *tu*; *ku* (刳), pronounced *ku*; *jian* (湔), *zeqian* cut; *xi* (洗), *xianli* cut; *yi* (议), pronounced *yi*; *yi* (臆), pronounced *yi*.\n\nPao Ba played the zither, and birds danced while fish leapt.\n\n*[Annotation:]* Pao Ba was an ancient master of the zither. Lu Wenchong notes: In the *Zang* edition, the character *zhi* (之) appears after *gu* (古). Liang Yusheng observes: In the *Xunzi* \"Encouraging Learning\" chapter, this passage reads \"played the *se*,\" likely altered to *se* due to the following phrase \"Bo Ya played the zither.\" Ma Xulun remarks: Ancient texts do not sharply distinguish between *qin* and *se*. The *Records of the Grand Historian*, *Hereditary House of Wei*, states \"Zhongqi leaned on a *qin* to respond,\" while the *Hanfeizi* renders it as \"pushed a *se*,\" and the *Garden of Persuasions* as \"propped a *se*—this is one such example.\"\n\n*Shiwen* notes: *pao* (匏) is pronounced *hu*.\n\nWhen Zheng Shiwen heard of this—\n\n*[Annotation:]* Shiwen was a music master of Zheng. Ma Xulun notes: The *Master Lü’s Spring and Autumn Annals*, \"Preserving the Ruler\" chapter, states: \"Zheng’s Grand Master Wen played the *se* all day and rose, bowing twice before his *se*, saying, ‘I have imitated you, imitated the inexhaustible’\"—this is the source of the *Liezi* annotation.\n\n—he abandoned his home to follow Master Xiang and study. Master Xiang was also an ancient master of the zither, and Shiwen followed him to learn. Bo Jun notes: The *Huainanzi*, \"Art of Rulership\" chapter, states: \"Confucius studied the zither under Master Xiang and grasped King Wen’s intent.\" Gao You’s commentary says: \"Master Xiang was the Grand Music Master of Lu.\"\n\nHe pressed the pegs and plucked the strings, yet for three years produced no melody.\n\n*[Annotation:]* He adjusted the strings with his fingers but could not compose a tune in three years. The *Shide Tang* edition writes *gou* (钩) for *jun* (钧), and *an* (按) for *an* (安). Yu Yue remarks: Zhang’s annotation, as given, suggests his text also read *jun* (钧), hence his gloss of \"adjusting the strings.\" The *Discourses of the States*, \"Discourses of Zhou,\" states: \"Fine *jun* has bells but no *bo*.\" Wei Zhao’s commentary says: \"*Jun* means to tune.\"\n\n*Shiwen* notes: *zhu* (柱) is written as *zhu* (住) in one edition. *Jun* (钧) is pronounced *jun*.\n\nMaster Xiang said: \"You may return home.\"\n\n*[Annotation:]* He suspected Shiwen was too difficult to teach.\n\nShiwen set down his zither.\n\n*Shiwen* notes: *She qi qin* (舍其琴) is written as *she qin* (舍琴). *She* (舍) is pronounced *she*.\n\nHe sighed and said: \"It is not that I cannot pluck the strings or compose a melody. What I seek does not lie in the strings, nor does my aspiration reside in sound.\n\n*[Annotation:]* Only by transcending strings and sound can one fully realize their use. Lu Wenchong notes: In the *Zang* edition, the annotation reads \"use of strings and sound.\"\n\nIf within I am not attuned to my heart, and without I do not respond to the instrument, how dare I lift my hands to move the strings?\n\n*[Annotation:]* Only when heart, hand, and instrument mutually respond without discord can harmonious sound arise.\n\n*[Exegesis:]* People know how to train the body to produce sound but do not understand that discerning sound and moving the body is the work of spirit. If the heart does not respond to the instrument, even if one succeeds, the result will not be refined. To exhaust the potential of sound and the subtlety of form, one must achieve spiritual resonance so that the heart naturally attains mastery.\n\nThe original text read *xuan ying* (玄应, \"mysterious response\"), but this follows the *Zang* edition’s correction to *hu ying* (互应, \"mutual response\").\n\n*Shiwen* notes: *Ying* (应) is pronounced *yìng*. *He* (和) is pronounced *hè*.\n\n\"Let me grant you a little more time to observe what follows.\"\n\nWang Chongmin notes: *Xiao* (小) means \"little.\" The *Shuowen* states: \"*Shao* (少) means not much.\" Duan Yucai’s commentary says: \"Not much is small, hence *shao* and *xiao* are interchangeably glossed and used.\" The *Book of Changes*, \"Appended Judgments,\" states: \"Knowing the small yet scheming for the great, strength little yet burden heavy\"—the Tang stone classics write *shao* (少) for *xiao* (小), which serves as evidence.\n\nBefore long, he again visited Master Xiang.\n\n*Shiwen* notes: *Ji* (几) is pronounced *jī*. *Fu* (复) is pronounced *fù*.\n\nMaster Xiang asked: \"How is your zither playing now?\"\n\nShiwen replied: \"I have grasped it.\"\n\n*[Annotation:]* Various sources, including the *Shi Lei Fu*, *Taiping Yulan*, and *Ji Zuan Yuan Hai*, include the character *wen* (文) before *de* (得).\n\n\"Let me hear it.\"\n\n*[Exegesis:]* When one attains mastery in the heart and responds to the instrument, one may then practice sound to communicate with the spirit.\n\nThus, in spring he struck the *shang* string to summon *Nanlü*—\n\n*[Annotation:]* *Shang* is the note of metal, belonging to autumn. *Nanlü* is the pitch of the eighth month.\n\n*Shiwen* notes: *Kou* (叩) is pronounced *kòu*.\n\nSuddenly, a cool wind arrived—\n\n*[Annotation:]* The Northern Song edition writes *hū* (忽) as *zǒng* (总), while Wang’s edition has *zǒng* (总). Here, we follow the correct reading from the *Zang* edition.\n\n*Shiwen* notes: One variant reads *hū zhì* (忽至) as *zǒng zhì* (总至), which is erroneous.\n\n—and the grasses and trees bore fruit.\n\n*[Annotation:]* Receiving the qi of autumn, they thus ripened.\n\nWhen autumn came, he struck the *jiao* string to rouse *Jiazhong*—\n\n*[Annotation:]* *Jiao* is the note of wood, belonging to spring. *Jiazhong* is the pitch of the second month.\n\n*Shiwen* notes: *Ji* (激) is pronounced *jī*. *Jia* (夹) is pronounced *jiá*.\n\nA warm breeze gently swirled, and the grasses and trees flourished in glory.\n\n*[Annotation:]* Receiving the qi of spring, they thus bloomed.\n\nIn summer, he struck the *yu* string to summon *Huangzhong*—\n\n*[Annotation:]* *Yu* is the note of water, belonging to winter. *Huangzhong* is the pitch of the eleventh month.\n\n*[Annotation:]* The *Jifu* edition writes *zhong* (钟) as *zhōng* (锺), as does the *Shidetang* edition, along with its commentary.\n\n*Shiwen* notes: *Yu* (羽) is pronounced *yù*.\n\nFrost and snow descended together, and rivers and ponds froze violently.\n\n*[Annotation:]* Receiving the qi of winter, yin thus congealed and waters froze.\n\n*Bo Jun’s note:* The *Records of the Grand Historian*’s \"Feng and Shan Sacrifices,\" the *Book of Han*’s \"Treatise on Suburban Sacrifices,\" and the *Book of Later Han*’s \"Biography of Zhang Heng\" all write *hù* (冱). It states: \"*Hù* means to congeal.\" In the *Zhuangzi*’s \"On the Equality of Things,\" \"The Milky Way *hù* but cannot chill,\" the *Shiwen* cites Xiang Xiu’s annotation: \"*Hù* means to freeze.\" *Hù* is also written as *hù*. Characters with the water radical are often confused. The *Jade Chapters* states: \"*Hù* means cold,\" and \"*Hù* means blockage.\" The meaning of blockage aligns with the *Zuozhuan*’s \"solid yin *hù* cold\" from the fourth year of Duke Zhao. Du Yu’s annotation reads: \"*Hù* means closure.\" In the *Zuozhuan*, *hù* is also written as *hù* in some editions. The *Collected Rhymes* treats *hù* as a variant of *hé* (涸), which matches the meaning in the *Shiwen*’s citation of Cui Zhuan’s annotation: \"*Hù* is like *hé*.\" It is likely that *hù* and *hù*, both with the water radical, were originally the same character, but later copyists either omitted or added strokes, corrupting them into two distinct forms.\n\n*Shiwen* notes: *Bao* (暴) is pronounced *bào*. *Hù* (冱) is pronounced *hù*.\n\nWhen winter came, he struck the *zhi* string to rouse *Ruibin*—\n\n*[Annotation:]* *Zhi* is the note of fire, belonging to summer. *Ruibin* is the pitch of the fifth month.\n\n*Shiwen* notes: *Zhi* (征) is pronounced *zhǐ*. *Rui* (蕤) is pronounced *ruí*.\n\nThe sun’s rays blazed fiercely, and solid ice instantly dispersed.\n\n*[Annotation:]* Receiving the qi of summer, it thus dissolved.\n\nPlaying the zither in one season could not abruptly alter the four seasons. This merely illustrates the effects of one season, from which the other three may be inferred, and further demonstrates the marvel of the resonance thus evoked.\n\n*Bo Jun’s note:* Chenggong Sui’s *Rhapsody on the Whistle* states: \"Striking the *zhi* note makes midwinter swelter; galloping the *yu* note makes severe frost wither summer’s growth. Moving the *shang* note makes autumn rains descend in spring; playing the *jiao* note makes valley winds rustle the branches.\" Another note: The *Shidetang* edition writes *jié* (节) as *shí* (时).\n\n*Shiwen* notes: *Chi* (炽) is pronounced *chì*.\n\nAs the piece neared its end, he commanded the *gong* note to harmonize the four strings, whereupon a balmy breeze soared, auspicious clouds drifted, sweet dew descended, and fragrant springs welled forth.\n\n*[Annotation:]* The attainment of perfect harmony brings this about.\n\n*Lu Wenchang notes:* \"*Lǐ* (澧)\" is interchangeable with \"*lǐ* (醴).\" The *Zang* edition’s annotation omits the words \"*zhī yě* (之也).\"\n\n*Shiwen* notes: *Lǐ* (澧) is pronounced *lǐ*.\n\nMaster Xiang then clapped his chest and leapt in exaltation, exclaiming: \"How sublime is your playing! Even the *Qingjiao* of Master Kuang—\n\n*[Annotation:]* When Master Kuang played *Qingjiao* for Duke Ping of Jin, at the first performance, a white cloud arose from the northwest; at the second, a great wind arrived with rain following; at the third, curtains tore, sacrificial vessels shattered, tiles flew from the corridors, and attendants scattered in flight. Duke Ping cowered in terror, and the state of Jin suffered a great drought, its lands scorched for three years. Whether the sounds Duke Ping obtained were auspicious or ominous remains uncertain.\n\n*[Annotation:]* Some versions read \"Thus it is said: 'Whether the sounds obtained were...'\"—this should be followed.\n\n*Shiwen* notes: *Wéi* (为) is pronounced *wèi*.\n\n—or the pitch-piping of Zou Yan—\n\n*[Annotation:]* In the north, there was a land, fertile yet frigid, where the five grains would not grow. Zou Yan blew his pitch-pipes to warm it, and millet flourished.\n\n*Shiwen* notes: *Zōu* (邹) is pronounced *zōu*. *Yǎn* (衍) is pronounced *yǎn*.\n\nA man of Qi, he served as tutor to King Zhao of Yan, resided at Jixia, and was called \"Zou Yan Who Discourses on Heaven.\" He authored forty-nine chapters, and also composed *The Fifty-Six Chapters of Beginning and End.*\"\n\nNo addition could surpass it.\n\n*Shiwen* notes: *Wáng* (亡) is pronounced *wú*.\n\nThat one would but clutch a zither, grasp a flute, and follow behind you.\n\n*[Annotation:]* What is inherent in one’s nature moves and acts, yet accords with the reckonings of yin and yang and the sequences of the four seasons. Even water and fire cannot scorch or drown it—how much less the qi of wind, rain, cold, or heat? Thus the *Yi* says: “Act before Heaven, and Heaven does not oppose it—how much less man? How much less ghosts and spirits?” This is what is meant.\n\nTo call it “pitch-piping that transforms” is not to rely on the four seasons.\n\n*Shiwen* notes: *Xié* (挟) is pronounced *xié*.\n\nXue Tan studied singing under Qin Qing.\n\n*[Annotation:]* These two were skilled singers of Qin.\n\nLu Wenchang notes: The annotation’s *gē* (歌) appears as *ōu* (讴) in the *Zangwai* edition.\n\nBo Jun observes: The *Chuci*’s *Dazhao* says, “Singing in harmony, voices raised, with Zhao flutes leading the chorus.” Wang Yi’s annotation says: “Unaccompanied singing is called *ōu*.”\n\n*Shiwen* notes: *Ōu* (讴) is pronounced *ōu*.\n\nBefore he had mastered all of Qing’s art,\n\n*Shiwen* notes: *Jì* (技) is pronounced *qǐ*.\n\nhe declared himself fully learned and took his leave to return home. Qin Qing did not detain him.\n\nAt the crossroads of the outskirts, Qin Qing saw him off with a farewell feast. Beating time on his staff, he sang a song of sorrow—its sound shook the forest trees, its resonance halted the passing clouds.\n\n*Shiwen* notes: *È* (遏) is pronounced *wò*.\n\nXue Tan then begged to return and apologized, never again daring to speak of going home. Qin Qing turned to his friends and said: “Long ago, Han E—a skilled singer of Han—\n\n*[Annotation:]* Han E was a skilled singer from the state of Han.\n\ntraveled east to Qi. When her provisions ran out, she passed through Yong Gate,\n\n*Shiwen* notes: *Guò* (過) is pronounced *gē*; *Yōng* (雍) is pronounced *yōng*.\n\n*[Annotation:]* Yong Gate was a place name. Du Yu notes: “A city gate of Qi.”\n\nwhere she sold her songs to beg for food.\n\n*Shiwen* notes: *Yù* (鬻) is pronounced *yù*.\n\nAfter she left, her lingering notes coiled around the roof beams for three days without fading, so those nearby believed she had not yet departed. When she passed through an inn, the innkeeper insulted her.”\n\nHan E then let forth a drawn-out, mournful wail.\n\n*[Annotation:]* *Màn shēng* (曼声) means \"prolonged tones.\"\n\n*Shiwen* notes: *Màn shēng* (曼声) means \"drawn-out voice.\"\n\nThe old and young of the entire village were overcome with sorrow,\n\n*Shiwen* notes: *Yī lǐ* (一里) in one version reads *shí lǐ* (十里).\n\ntears streaming as they faced one another,\n\n*Shiwen* notes: *Tì* (涕) is pronounced *tǐ*, meaning \"tears from the eyes.\"\n\nand for three days they could not eat. Hastening to pursue her, they begged Han E to return. When she came back, she once more sang in long, drawn-out notes.\n\n*Shiwen* notes: *Fù* (复) is pronounced *fú*.\n\nThe old and young of the entire village leapt for joy, clapping and dancing,\n\n*Shiwen* notes: *Biàn* (抃) is pronounced *biàn*.\n\nunable to restrain themselves,\n\n*Shiwen* notes: *Jīn* (禁) is pronounced *jīn*.\n\nand forgot their former grief. They then richly rewarded her and sent her on her way.\n\n*[Annotation:]* *Fā* (发) means \"to dispatch.\"\n\nThus, to this day, the people of Yong Gate are skilled in singing and wailing, imitating Han E’s lingering voice.\n\n*[Annotation:]* During the Warring States period, there was a man of Yong Gate named Zhou, who was skilled in playing the qin and also in wailing. He used his wailing to petition Lord Mengchang.\n\n*[Exegesis:]* When any of the six senses is employed, it may attain communion. Once communion is achieved, marvelous responses arise without limit—not merely through the mind’s perception. Thus, Gongyu of Lu spoke directly of the mind’s function, while those after Huba attained communion through sound.\n\n*Bo Jun’s note:* Lu Ji, in his imitation of *\"Today a Fine Morning Gathering\"* (《拟今日良辰会》), wrote: *\"Mournful notes coil around the roof beams, / Lingering echoes enter the Milky Way.\"* Li Shan’s commentary cites this passage, though in truth, such events were recorded in antiquity, and the forger of the *Liezi* merely borrowed them. The current edition of the *Bowuzhi* contains a largely similar account.\n\nAdditionally, it is noted: In various editions of the *Daoist Canon*, the Northern Song edition, and the Jifu edition, the character 放 is rendered as 效. The *Shiwen* glosses: 放, pronounced *fēng* (divided into two pronunciations).\n\nBo Ya was skilled in playing the qin, while Zhong Ziqi was skilled in listening. When Bo Ya played the qin, his intent was in ascending the high mountains. Wang Shumin remarks: The character 登 (\"ascend\") is likely a superfluous interpolation. \"Intent in the high mountains\" parallels the following \"intent in flowing waters.\" The *Jizuan Yuanhai* (52, 78), *He Bi Shi Lei* (Former Collection, 57), and *Yunfu Qunyu* (8) all omit the character 登. The *Lüshi Chunqiu* (\"Benwei\" chapter), *Han Shi Waizhuan* (9), and *Shuo Yuan* (\"Zunxian\" chapter) likewise concur.\n\nZhong Ziqi said: \"Excellent! Lofty as Mount Tai!\" The *Shiwen* glosses: 峨, pronounced *é*.\n\nWhen his intent was in flowing waters, Zhong Ziqi said: \"Excellent! Vast as the Yangtze and the Yellow River!\" Whatever Bo Ya contemplated, Zhong Ziqi invariably grasped it.\n\nBo Ya traveled to the northern slopes of Mount Tai when suddenly he encountered a violent storm. The *Shiwen* glosses: 卒, pronounced *cù* (entering tone). He took shelter beneath a cliff. Overcome with sorrow, he took up his qin and played. First, he performed the *Linyu Zhi Cao* (\"Melody of Endless Rain\"). The *Shiwen* notes: 霖 is written as 淋, pronounced *lín*. 操, pronounced *cào*. Then he composed the sound of crumbling mountains.\n\nWith every melody Bo Ya played, Zhong Ziqi invariably fathomed its essence. Thereupon Bo Ya set down his qin and sighed, *Shiwen* glosses: 舍, pronounced *shě*. \"Excellent! Excellent indeed is your listening! Your intent and imagination are as my own heart.\" {Annotation: This speaks of a hidden accord, no different from his own.} *Shiwen* glosses: 夫, pronounced *fú*. \"Where can I conceal my sound from you?\" {Annotation: Once the sound is uttered, Zhong Ziqi has already grasped his heart—thus there is no place to hide his sound.}\n\n{Exegesis: The formation of sound arises from and moves through resonance; the arising of the heart, sound follows in its wake. Thus the five senses all communicate, all transmitted by the discerning mind. One adept at listening can know even a sigh or a cough—how much more so when sound is formed through pattern? How could it not be distinguished?}\n\nQin Enfu notes: Lu’s exegesis reads \"discerning mind\" as \"mind’s discernment.\"\n\nBo Jun’s note: The *Taiping Yulan* (1) cites the *Fuzi*: \"When Bo Ya traveled to the northern slopes of Mount Tai, he encountered a violent storm and took shelter beneath a cliff. He took up his qin and played, performing the *Linyu* melody, then composing the sound of crumbling mountains. With every melody he played, Zhong Ziqi invariably fathomed its essence. He said: 'Excellent indeed is your listening!'\"\n\nThe *Lüshi Chunqiu*'s \"Benwei\" chapter closely aligns with the *Liezi*, for the *Liezi* borrows from the \"Benwei\" text. During King Mu of Zhou’s western expedition, he crossed the Kunlun Mountains but did not reach Yan Mountain. Wang Chongmin notes: The character \"不\" (*not*) is likely an interpolation. The *Mu Tianzi Zhuan* states: \"The Son of Heaven then drove onward, ascending Yan Mountain.\" The \"King Mu of Zhou\" chapter also records: \"He then (should read *westward*, as previously noted) observed where the sun sets,\" likewise referring to the ascent of Yan Mountain. Thus, King Mu did indeed reach Yan Mountain. If the character \"不\" were present, it would contradict the facts. The *Shiwen* glosses: *Yan* is pronounced *yan*. Yan Mountain is where the sun enters.\n\nUpon his return, before reaching the Central States, a craftsman named Yanshi was presented along the way. (Note: Along the way, a state offered this master artisan.) Bo Jun notes: According to Zhang’s commentary, the original text should read: \"Upon his return, before reaching [the Central States], a state along the way presented a craftsman named Yanshi.\" In the current text, the characters \"国\" (*state*) and \"道\" (*way*) are mistakenly reversed, leading to the erroneous punctuation of \"before reaching the Central States\" as a complete phrase. Though the meaning remains coherent, the original authenticity is lost.\n\nKing Mu received him. (Note: *Received* should read *presented*. The *Shiwen* glosses: *Jian* (*received*) is pronounced *jin* (*presented*) in the *Guangya*, and the same applies below.) The king asked: \"What skills do you possess?\" Yanshi replied: \"I await only your command to demonstrate. However, I have already created something and wish for Your Majesty to see it first.\" The king said: \"Come another day, (Note: *Day* refers to another day.) and we shall observe it together.\" (Exegesis: The marvel of its function extends beyond sound alone. Color, fragrance, and flavor all attain their principles. Thus, this chapter speaks of carving that exhausts the subtlest details.)\n\nThe next day, Yanshi had an audience with the king. (\"The next day\" in the Yuan edition and the Shidetang edition both read \"the following day\"; the *Taiping Yulan* [752] cites it as \"the next day.\" The *Shiwen* notes: *Yueri* (*the next day*) in one version reads *yiri* (*the following day*). *See* is pronounced *xiàn* below.) The king received him and asked: \"Who is the person who came with you?\" He replied: \"It is an entertainer I have created.\" (Note: *Chang* refers to actors and jesters. The *Shiwen* glosses: *Chang* is pronounced *chāng*. *Pai* is pronounced *bāi*.)\n\nKing Mu gazed at it in astonishment. It walked briskly, bowed, and raised its head—truly human in appearance. (The *Shiwen* glosses: *Qu* is pronounced *qū*.) When the skilled craftsman nodded its chin, it sang in perfect harmony with the pitch. (The *Daozang* Four-Exegesis edition reads \"顉\" as \"颔.\" The *Daozang* unannotated edition, Lin Xiyi’s edition, and Jiang Yu’s edition all read \"镇,\" which is likely a corrupted form of \"顉.\" Wang Chongmin notes: The *Wenxuan* commentary on Guo Pu’s \"Youxian\" poem and the *Taiping Yulan* [752] both cite \"顉\" as \"颔.\" The characters *顉* and *颔* are similar in form and meaning, and since later readers were more familiar with *颔* and less with *顉*, those who wrote *颔* were all later emendations. The *Zuozhuan* of the twenty-sixth year of Duke Xiang states: \"Those who greeted at the gate merely nodded their chins,\" while the *Shuowen* cites it as \"顉.\" The *Hanshu* \"Biography of Yang Xiong\" reads: \"nodding the chin and furrowing the brow,\" and Song Qi notes: \"*颔* in one version reads *顉*.\" The *Shuowen* defines: \"*顉*: to lower the head.\" The *Yupian* defines: \"*顉*: to bend the chin.\" Ancient language used *曲* (*bend*) for *钦* (*to admire*), and *低* (*low*, should read *氐* [*root*]) and *曲* both imply a swaying motion. *顉* is glossed as \"lowering the head,\" and *顉颐* as \"bending the chin.\" Since *顉* is derived from *页* (*head*), its meaning adapts to the context. *顉* is the correct character; *颔* is an error. The *Shiwen* glosses: *Fu* is pronounced *fú*. *顉* is pronounced *qū*, meaning \"to bend the chin,\" and also *wǔgǎn* in another reading, meaning \"to shake the head.\" *颐* is pronounced *yí*.) When he raised its hands, it danced in perfect rhythm. With a thousand transformations and ten thousand changes, it followed every intention.\n\nThe king took it for a real person and, together with Sheng Ji, his favored concubine, observed it closely. (Note: The *Mu Tianzi Zhuan* states: Sheng Ji was King Mu’s beloved consort. Bo Jun notes: The *Jinshu* \"Biography of Shu Xi\" mentions that among the miscellaneous texts from the Ji Tomb, one of the nineteen chapters records the death of King Mu’s beloved consort, Sheng Ji.)\n\nAs the performance neared its end, the entertainer winked at the king’s attendants and concubines. The king grew furious and immediately sought to execute Yanshi. Terrified, Yanshi (The *Shiwen* glosses: *She* is pronounced *rèshè*.) promptly disassembled the entertainer to show the king. It was entirely composed of joined leather, wood, glue, lacquer, white, black, red, and blue pigments. (The *Shiwen* glosses: *Fu* is pronounced *fù*.)\n\nThe king examined it carefully. (The *Shiwen* glosses: *Di* is pronounced *dūjì*. *Liao* is pronounced *lìdiào*.) Inside were the liver, gallbladder, heart, lungs, spleen, kidneys, intestines, and stomach. (The *Shiwen* glosses: *Gan* is pronounced *gān*. *Dan* is pronounced *dǎngǎn*. *Fei* is pronounced *fāngfèi*. *Pi* is pronounced *pí*. *Shen* is pronounced in the falling tone.) Outside were sinews, bones, limbs, joints, skin, hair, teeth, and hair. (The *Shiwen* glosses: *Jin* is pronounced *jīn*.) All were artificial yet perfectly complete. When reassembled, it appeared as it had initially. (Note: As it had when first presented to the king. Bo Jun notes: The character \"见\" (*see*) is a superfluous interpolation from the commentary. The note explains \"如初\" (*as initially*) with \"如向者之始见王\" (*as when first seen by the king*), but the main text does not read \"初见\" (*first seen*). The *Taiping Yulan* [752] omits the character \"见,\" and it should be deleted accordingly. The *Shiwen* glosses: *Fu* is pronounced *fúyòu*, and also as in the original text.)\n\nThe king tested it by removing its heart, and its mouth could not speak. He removed its liver, and its eyes could not see. He removed its kidneys, and its feet could not walk. (Note: All these functions were controlled by mechanisms. Removing the master mechanism rendered them inoperative.)\n\nJust as when the five viscera in a person are afflicted with illness, the seven orifices and four limbs all manifest corresponding symptoms externally.\n\n[Exegesis] Now, the internal organs—liver, gallbladder, heart, and lungs—enable external functions such as seeing, hearing, and walking, for it is the spirit that animates them, thus giving life to the creature. If devoid of spirit, the five senses cannot be employed. How then does the creation of living things by the forces of transformation differ from the automaton crafted by Yan Shi? Were it without spirit, it would be no different from grass or wood. But if spirit is present, what is so extraordinary about its movement and function? The wooden figure operates by Yan Shi’s spirit, and thus it rightfully resembles a living creature. How far removed is the craftsman’s skill from the ultimate workings of transformation?\n\nAt this, King Mu was at last delighted and sighed, saying, “Can human ingenuity truly rival the work of the Creator in its achievement?”\n\nHe then commanded his secondary chariot to bear the automaton back to his palace.\n\n[Annotation] In recent times, some have claimed that human vitality arises from mechanical contrivances. Why so? The work of creation is supremely subtle, and thus all things are nurtured, moving without fixed pattern. Human artistry is crude, merely shaping form from inert matter. Yet when craft reaches its utmost, it nearly approaches the work of creation. This idea may have given rise to such theories, though this text itself does not endorse them. The purpose here is to clarify that when skill attains its utmost, thought transcends conventional bounds, and thus examples of extreme craft are adduced to dispel common delusions—how could one ever claim that things lack a spiritual master? Such a view is far from the truth.\n\n[Annotation] The *Shide Tang* edition omits the character *zhe* (者) in “而生者.” The character *ji* (几) is written as *ji* (机), and *xie* (邪) as *ye* (也). Lu Wenchang notes that the two characters “巧极” are inverted in the annotation.\n\n[Exegesis] The cloud ladder of Ban Shu and the flying kite of Mo Di were both deemed the pinnacle of their abilities.\n\n[Annotation] Ban Shu constructed a cloud ladder for scaling heights and attacking from below. Mozi fashioned a wooden kite that flew for three days without landing.\n\n[Bo Jun’s note] The *Mozi*, in the *Lu Wen* chapter, states: “Gongshuzi carved bamboo and wood into a *□*, which, once completed, flew for three days without descending.” The *Huainanzi*, in the *Qi Su Xun*, records: “Luban and Mozi made wooden kites that flew for three days without landing.” The *Han Feizi*, in the *Wai Chu Shuo*, says: “Mozi crafted a wooden kite, taking three years to complete it, yet it flew for only a day before failing.” The *Lunheng*, in the *Ru Zeng* chapter, states: “Confucian texts praise the skill of Luban and Mozi, who carved wooden kites that flew for three days without landing.” The same is repeated in the *Luan Long* chapter. The *Baopuzi*, in the *Ying Chao* chapter, says: “Mozi carved a wooden rooster to soar into the heavens.” Some attribute this to Luban, others to Mozi, and some to both; some call it a kite, others a *□*, and still others a rooster—variations in transmission for the same event.\n\nWhen Dongmen Jia and Qin Guli, disciples of Mo Di, heard of Yan Shi’s craft and reported it to the two masters,\n\n[Sun Yirang’s note] Dongmen Jia was likely a disciple of Ban Shu, hence the phrase “reported it to the two masters.” Some suggest he was also a disciple of Mozi, but this is incorrect.\n\n[Exegesis] the two masters never again dared to speak of their arts and henceforth held fast to their compass and square.\n\n[Annotation] “Held fast to their compass and square” means they dared not boast of their skills.\n\n[Exegesis] For Yan Shi’s work was of such subtlety that his spirit merged with the work of creation, whereas the likes of Ban Shu merely exhausted their skill in mechanical contrivances. This illustrates that the most wondrous achievements cannot be confined to mere rule and measure.\n\nThe *Jifu* edition includes the character *yan* (焉) after *ju* (矩).\n\nWu Kaisheng remarks: “Held fast to their compass and square” signifies diligent study.\n\n[Bo Jun’s note] The *Quan Jin Wen*, in volume 50, records the *Biography of Master Ma* by Fu Xuan: “Later, someone presented a hundred entertainments, which could be set up but not animated. The Emperor asked Master Ma, ‘Can they be made to move?’ He replied, ‘They can.’”\n\nThe Emperor asked, “Can its ingenuity be enhanced further?” He replied, “It can.” Receiving the imperial command, he crafted it from large timber, shaping it like a wheel. When placed upon level ground and secretly activated by water, it produced female musicians and dancing figures. Thereupon, the wooden figures beat drums and blew flutes, formed mountains and peaks, and made the wooden men juggle balls and toss swords, climbing ropes and standing upside-down. They moved in and out freely, performed official duties, operated pestles and mills, and staged cockfights—transforming their artistry in a hundred ways.\n\nThus it is evident that skilled artisans already existed in the Wei dynasty.\n\n[Exegesis] *Shuo* is pronounced *shuo*.\n\nGan Ying was an ancient master archer. [Bo Jun’s note] The *Lüshi Chunqiu*, in its “Ting Yan” chapter, states: “Feng Men first learned archery from Gan Ying.” Gao You’s commentary notes: “Gan Ying was presumably the name of an archer.”\n\nHe drew his bow, and beasts prostrated themselves while birds descended. [Annotation] His arrows never missed, so beasts and birds dared not flee. The *Strategies of the Warring States* records: “Geng Lei loosed an empty shot, and a bird fell.” The Daoist Canon’s annotation reads “birds and beasts” instead of “beasts and birds.”\n\n[Bo Jun’s note] The *Bowu Zhi* also records the tales of Gan Ying, Fei Wei, and Geng Lei shooting without an arrow to bring down birds, evidently drawing from the *Strategies of the Warring States*.\n\n[Exegesis] *Gou* is pronounced *gou*, meaning to draw a bow. *Geng* is pronounced *geng*. *Ying* is pronounced *ying*.\n\nHis disciple, named Fei Wei, studied archery under Gan Ying and surpassed his master in skill.\n\n[Wang Shumin’s note] The *Shilei Fu* (chapter 13) and the *Taiping Yulan* (volume 350) both cite the *Liezi* as saying: “Fei Wei learned archery from Gan Ying and mastered all techniques except the *nie* method. Wei secretly carried arrows to shoot at Ying. Ying bit the arrowhead and shot it back at Wei. Wei ran around a tree, and the arrow followed him in circles.” This passage is absent from the current text. It is unclear whether this is a lost fragment of the present section; I record it here for further consideration.\n\nJi Chang, in turn, studied archery under Fei Wei. Fei Wei said: “First learn not to blink, and only then may we speak of archery.” Ji Chang returned home and lay beneath his wife’s loom, gazing upward at the treadle. [Annotation] The *qian ting* refers to the loom’s treadle.\n\n[Wang Shaolan’s note] *Ting* should be the character *□*, a scribal error (□ was corrupted to *jie*, which was further corrupted to *ting*. Judging from Zhan’s commentary, the error already existed in the Jin dynasty). The *Shuowen Jiezi* defines *□* as “the footrest beneath a loom.”\n\nWith the *□* referring to the treadle, beneath the loom hang two boards suspended by cords, which the feet press to raise and lower the warp threads for weaving—this is called the *qian□*. The treadle moves up and down more swiftly than the eye can blink, so Ji Chang practiced not blinking by lying beneath the loom and gazing at it. After two years, he no longer blinked.\n\nXu Lian’s explanation is the same.\n\nWang Chongmin notes: The *Taiping Yulan* (745 and 852) both render *wo* (“lying”) as *zuo* (“sitting”). The *Shiwen* states: *Ting* is read *tu ding* cut. *Nie* is read *nü zhe* cut.\n\nAfter two years, even when a needle’s tip was turned toward his eye’s corner, he did not blink.\n\nWang Chongmin notes: The *Taiping Yulan* (745) renders *er nian* (“two years”) as *san nian* (“three years”), and *dao* (“turned”) as *dao* (“reached”). The same text in volume 825 also renders it as *dao* (“reached”), suggesting that *dao* (“reached”) is correct.\n\nThe *Shiwen* states: *Zhui* is read *zhui*. *Dao* is read *du dao* cut. *Zi* is read *zai yi* cut.\n\nHe reported this to Fei Wei. Fei Wei said: “Not yet.\n\n[Explanation] To shoot birds from a drawn bow is the subtlety of skill; to surpass one’s master is to attain the divine. Subtlety lies in practice, while the divine resides in precision. First learning not to blink is the height of precision. Gazing at the treadle without moving the eyes is the stabilization of spirit. Yet though stabilized, it remains unusable—hence, it is still not enough. You must next learn to see.”\n\n[Explanation] This means applying the unblinking gaze to vision.\n\nThe *Daozang* white-text edition, Lin Xiyi’s edition, Yuan edition, and Shidetang edition all render *bi xue* (“must learn”) as *ya xue* (“next learn”). The *Shiwen* renders *bi* as *ya*, reading *wu jia* cut, meaning “next.” One variant reads *bi xue* (“must learn”), which is incorrect.\n\n“See the small as large, the faint as distinct, and only then tell me.”\n\n[Explanation] *Shi* (“see”) means to scrutinize, so that the small appears large.\n\nJi Chang suspended a louse from the window with a yak’s hair and faced south to observe it. The *Shiwen* renders *shi* (“louse”) as *shi*, reading *mao* for *mao* and *suo yi* cut for *shi*.\n\nWithin ten days, it gradually grew larger. After three years, it appeared as large as a cartwheel. Gazing at other objects, they all seemed like hills and mountains.\n\n[Annotation] Seeing the louse as a wheel, other things proportionally appeared that large.\n\nThe *Shiwen* states: *Chen* is read *chi zheng* cut.\n\nThen, using a bow of Yan horn and an arrow shaft of northern *peng*, he shot it.\n\nWang Guoguo notes: The *Yijing* states: “Bend wood into a bow, sharpen wood into an arrow; the utility of bow and arrow is to overawe the world.” The *Zhouli Kaogongji* states: “The bowyer selects six materials for bow-making, each gathered in its proper season. The stave ensures distance; the horn ensures speed; the sinew ensures penetration; the glue ensures harmony; the silk ensures strength; the lacquer ensures resistance to frost and dew. In selecting the stave, there are seven grades: *zhe* is best, followed by *yi*, then mulberry, then orange, then quince, then *jing*, with bamboo as the lowest.” Thus, bows are made with wood as the stave, reinforced with horn, sinew, glue, silk, and lacquer for binding. A bow is never made of horn alone—it merely supplements the wood. In ancient times, simplicity prevailed, so the first bows were simply strung wood. By the Zhou, ritual and music flourished, and bows were crafted by combining horn, sinew, glue, silk, and lacquer. The *Hanshu Wuxingzhi* states: “The *hu* is the bow.” The *Liji* states: “Mulberry bow and *peng* arrows.” All these refer to wooden bows. Yet the *Liezi* states: “He then shot it with a bow of Yan horn and an arrow shaft of northern *peng*,” implying the bow was made of horn. Thus, bows could be made of wood or horn, with no fixed rule.\n\nJiao Jun notes: The character *shuo* (“northern”) should be *jing* (“*jing* wood”), a graphic error due to similarity. The *Kaogongji* states: “Yan’s horn and Jing’s wood are the finest materials,” which is the source of this passage. Moreover, *jing* is paired with *yan* (“Yan”), suggesting it does not generically refer to the northern regions. The *Taiping Yulan* (347, 745, and 951) all repeat this error.\n\nThe *Shiwen* states: *Yan* is read *yan*. *Hu* is read *hu*. *Gan* is read *gan*. *She* is read *shi yi* cut.\n\nThe arrow pierced the louse’s heart, yet the louse remained suspended without falling.\n\n[Annotation] Using a strong bow and a stiff arrow to pierce the louse’s heart demonstrates the mastery of his hand.\n\nThe *Shiwen* renders *qiang* (“strong”) as *qiang*, reading *qiang qi liang* cut.\n\nHe reported this to Fei Wei. Fei Wei leapt up, striking his chest, and said:\n\nJiao Jun notes: The *Shuowen* defines *ying* as “chest.”\n\nThe *Shiwen* states: *Fu ying* is read *fu ying*.\n\n“You have attained it!”\n\n[Explanation] Seeing the small as large, piercing it was no longer difficult.\n\nAfter Ji Chang had mastered all of Fei Wei’s techniques, he calculated that only one person in the world could rival him. He then plotted to kill Fei Wei.\n\n[Explanation] He sought to surpass his master’s skill, aspiring to exceed his teachings—not to end his life but to erase his reputation.\n\nThey met in the wild.\n\nWang Shumin notes: The *Shiwen Leiju* (42), *He bi shilei* (57), and *Tianzhong ji* (41) all include “one day” before “met,” which should be followed.\n\nThe two exchanged shots. Midway, their arrowheads clashed and fell to the ground,\n\nThe *Shiwen* states: *Feng* is read *feng*. One variant renders *zhui* (“fell”) as *dui*.\n\nand the dust did not rise.\n\nFei Wei’s arrows were the first to be exhausted.\n\n[Annotation] *Qiong* means “exhausted.”\n\nJi Chang loosed one final arrow. As it flew, Fei Wei intercepted it with the tip of a thorn, without the slightest deviation.\n\n[Explanation] The two arrows, following the same path and reaching the end of their force, fell to the ground without stirring the dust—so minute was their impact. That he could intercept with a thorn without error shows the utmost precision.\n\nThereupon, the two men wept and cast aside their bows, bowing to each other on the road and pledging to become father and son. They cut their arms to swear an oath,\n\n[Exegesis] *Huainanzi* states: “In the Central States, they smear blood on the mouth; among the Yue people, they cut the arm—both are the same.” Xu Shen explains: “To *ke bi* is to draw blood from the arm.”\n\nand vowed never to teach their art to others.\n\n[Annotation] To keep their Way secret.\n\nThis chapter’s principles and examples are already detailed in the “Zhongni” section.\n\n[Explanation] This is what is meant by “spiritual communion and mutual understanding”—not merely the art of archery. Thus, they cast aside their bows and swore an oath. Only after their spirits had truly connected could the transmission occur, and so they could not impart their art to others.\n\nThe teacher of Zaofu was named Taidou.\n\n[Annotation] Taidou appears in various miscellaneous records.\n\n[Collation] *Lüshi Chunqiu*’s “Ting Yan” chapter states: “Zaofu first studied under Da Dou.” Gao You’s commentary: “Da Dou was likely the name of a charioteer.” *Da Dou* is the same as *Taidou*.\n\n[Exegesis] *Zao* is pronounced *qi dao*; *fu* is pronounced *fu*.\n\nWhen Zaofu first began learning charioteering, he observed the rites with great humility, yet Taidou did not instruct him for three years.\n\n[Collation] *Yiwen Leiju* (746) includes the character *shi* (“Master”) after *Taidou*, and the same below.\n\nZaofu’s observance of the rites grew even more reverent, until Taidou finally told him: “An ancient poem says: ‘The son of a master bowyer must first learn to make a winnowing basket; the son of a master smith must first learn to make a fur coat.’”\n\n[Annotation] Both winnowing baskets and fur coats require bending and joining materials before they become useful implements. For bowyers and smiths, harmonizing sinew and horn or blending metal and iron follows the same principle. Thus, a student must first master what is easy before achieving what is difficult—this is the analogy.\n\n[Explanation] The winnowing basket is the tool used to craft a bow; the fur coat is the tool used to fan the forge. Laozi likened it to a bellows, which today would be called a bag. The one shapes the bow’s frame, the other fans the fire—though neither is the bow or the forge itself, both are indispensable to their making.\n\n[Collation] *Liji*’s “Xue Ji” states: “The son of a master smith must first learn to make a fur coat; the son of a master bowyer must first learn to make a winnowing basket.” Another note: In the *Shide Tang* edition, the annotation’s *yu* (“analogy”) is written as *lun* (“discourse”).\n\n[Exegesis] *Yi* is pronounced *yi chi*.\n\n“First observe my movements.\n\n[Annotation] *Qu* means “movement.”\n\n[Exegesis] *Qu* is pronounced *qu*; the same below.\n\nWhen your movements match mine, then you may grasp the six reins,\n\n[Exegesis] *Pei* is pronounced *bi*.\n\nand the six horses may be driven.”\n\nZaofu replied: “I will follow your command.”\n\nThen Taidou set up wooden planks as a path, just wide enough to hold the feet—\n\n[Annotation] Only enough to steady the soles.\n\n[Exegesis] *Jin* is pronounced *jin*.\n\n—measuring his steps to place them,\n\n[Annotation] Spaced as his strides required.\n\n[Exegesis] *Ji* is pronounced *ji*, meaning \"dense.\"\n\nHe trod upon them and walked, running back and forth with speed and agility, never stumbling or faltering.\n\n[Exegesis] *Die* is pronounced *tu*.\n\nZaofu learned this, and in three days mastered its skill. Taidou sighed and said: \"How keen you are! How swiftly you have grasped it!\n\n[Annotation] *Min* means \"quick\"; *jie* means \"swift.\"\n\n[Exegesis] *Jie* is pronounced *ji ye*.\n\nIn all your driving, proceed likewise.\"\n\n[Exegesis] The planks were shaped like feet, arranged like steps. *Zhuangzi* says: \"Beyond the space where one’s feet could tread, the earth was cleared away—yet those who could not walk upon it were unsettled in mind.\" So too with driving horses: if one guides them as one guides one’s own feet, then mastery is achieved.\n\n[Collation] Lu’s exegesis cites *Zhuangzi*, but no such passage exists in the received text.\n\n\"Formerly, in your walking, you gained it through the feet and responded with the heart. Extend this to driving: harmony is achieved in the interplay of reins and bit,\n\n[Exegesis] *Ji* is pronounced *ji*. The *Shuowen* says: *Ji* means \"chariot carriage.\" Here it speaks of Zaofu’s skill in driving—how the alignment of the carriage depends on the reins and bit, just as a ruler who wins the people’s hearts brings peace to the state.\n\n—while urgency and ease reside in the harmony of the lips and mouth, correctness and measure dwell in the center of the chest,\n\n[Collation] The *Shuowen* says: \"*Yi* is the breastbone; sometimes written with the *yi* radical.\" The *Guangya* explains: \"*Yi* means 'chest.'\" Xu’s commentary on the *Wenxuan*’s \"Shelie Fu\" says: \"*Yi* means 'breast.'\"\n\n[Exegesis] *Wen* is pronounced *wu fen*; *yi* is pronounced *yi*.\n\n—and rhythm is held in the grasp of the hands.\"\n\nWithin, harmony is found at the center of the heart, while without, it aligns with the horse’s will—thus one can advance and retreat as if treading a plumb line, and turn in curves as if compass-drawn. Tao Hongqing says: The character *ju* (矩, \"square\") is superfluous. The original text reads: *\"Advance and retreat in accord with the plumb line, and turn in curves in accord with the compass,\"* meaning *\"straight movements follow the plumb line, curved movements follow the compass.\"* The *Huainanzi’s* \"Treatise on the Dao of Rulership\" quotes this passage without the character *ju*. Wang Chongmin says: Tao’s view is correct. The *Zhuangzi’s* \"Attaining Life\" chapter states: *\"Dongye Bi was presented to Duke Zhuang for his driving skill; his advance and retreat followed the plumb line, and his left and right turns followed the compass,\"* identical in meaning to this passage from the *Liezi* but without the character *ju*, which serves as proof. For *\"treading the plumb line\"* and *\"following the compass\"* form a parallel structure; if *ju* were included, not only would the meaning be disrupted, but the phrasing would become redundant. The *Taiping Yulan* (746) also omits *ju*. Yang Bojun notes: The *Lüshi Chunqiu’s* \"Adapting to Might\" chapter likewise states: *\"Dongye Ji was presented to Duke Zhuang for his driving skill; his advance and retreat followed the plumb line, and his left and right turns followed the compass,\"* and further: *\"For advance and retreat to follow the plumb line, and left and right turns to follow the compass—even Zaofu’s driving could not surpass this,\"* both omitting *ju*, providing further conclusive evidence.\n\nWith the Dao mastered, one travels great distances while qi and strength remain abundant—truly, the art is fully attained. What is received through the bit responds to the reins; what is received through the reins responds to the hands; what is received through the hands responds to the heart. Thus, one need not rely on the eyes to see nor the whip to urge. With the mind at ease and the body aligned, the six reins remain untangled, and the twenty-four hooves land without error. In turning, circling, advancing, or retreating, all moves accord with rhythm.\n\n[Annotation] This corresponds to the harmonious sounds of the *heluan* bells.\n\nOnly then can the space beyond the carriage wheels leave no excess tracks, and the space beyond the horse’s hooves leave no wasted ground. One remains unaware of the peril of mountains and valleys or the levelness of plains and lowlands—all appear as one. My art has reached its limit. Remember this well!\n\n[Annotation] The path one treads requires only enough space for the feet. When no excess ground is needed beyond the feet, and others dare not tread there, it is because the mind is not at peace and the body is not at ease. When the mind is at peace and the body at ease, then movement and stillness follow constant measures, and slowness and speed adhere to fixed degrees. If one fully grasps the subtleties, this principle applies not only to the self but can be extended to all things. Even with the complexity of six reins and the multitude of a horse’s hooves, as long as they are regulated by the Dao, disorder is not a concern. Thus, one does not rely on the absence of useless tracks beyond the wheels, nor on the absence of wasted ground beyond the hooves—can this not be affirmed?\n\n[Exegesis] Zhuangzi, in his explanation of butchering an ox, says: *\"Between the bones there are gaps, and the blade of the knife has no thickness. When that which has no thickness enters where there is a gap, there is ample room to move.\"* This speaks of the principle of abundant space. By not regarding the ground beyond the feet, one’s will becomes focused. With focused will, the feet move as the heart directs. If this principle is applied to reins and bits, or exchanged for fine horses, then where tracks align with hooves, what danger could there be? Most people seek only the superficial and do not grasp the root; those who recognize the truth must first seek the root before applying it. Thus, even the minor arts of archery and driving must accord with the Dao.\n\nYang Bojun notes: The exegesis cites the *Zhuangzi’s* \"Nourishing Life\" chapter but only summarizes its general meaning, not the original text.\n\nWei Hei Mao killed Qiu Bingzhang out of personal enmity.\n\n[Annotation] *Nixian* refers to private resentment.\n\n[Exegesis] Those who kill or harm out of personal enmity, or who destroy things out of desire, act according to the common ways of the world—not the conduct of one who embodies the Dao.\n\nLai Dan, the son of Qiu Bingzhang, plotted to avenge his father’s death. Wang Chongmin notes: The *Taiping Yulan* (344, 386, and 482) all render \"avenge\" as \"repay.\" Wang Shumin adds: The *Beitang Shuchao* (122), *Shilei Fu* (13), and *Shuwu Yiming Shu* (8) likewise render \"avenge\" as \"repay.\" Dan’s qi was fierce, but his form was emaciated. Yang Bojun notes: The *Liji* (*Tan Gong*) states, \"Gather the limbs and form.\" Zheng Xuan’s commentary: \"Form refers to the body.\" The *Zuozhuan* (*Zhao* 1) reads, \"Do not allow blockages or stagnation that expose the body.\" Du Yu’s commentary: \"Exposed means frail.\" Thus, \"form emaciated\" means \"body exceedingly frail.\" The subsequent annotation by Zhang clarifies this as \"body frail and weak,\" precisely capturing its meaning. He measured his food by grains and moved only with the wind. Though enraged, he could not wield weapons to exact vengeance. [Annotation] Though bold in spirit, his body was frail and weak, rendering him unable to lift arms. Wang Chongmin notes: The *Taiping Yulan* (482) renders \"enraged\" as \"resentful.\" Given the following line—\"Lai Dan’s friend Shen Ta said, ‘Your resentment against Hei Mao has reached its limit’\"—the variant \"resentful\" may be more accurate. [Pronunciation] *Cheng* (wield): *chi zheng* cut. *Lei* (frail): *li wei* cut.\n\nHe sought aid from others, vowing to slaughter Hei Mao with his bare hands and sword. Hei Mao’s ferocity surpassed all others. [Pronunciation] *Han* (ferocity): *han* sound. His strength equaled that of a hundred men. His sinews, bones, skin, and flesh were not of human kind.\n\nHe craned his neck to meet the blade—*Dao* in the *Zangben* and *Shidetang* editions—laid bare his chest to receive the arrows. Though the edges of spears and swords bent and shattered, his body bore no mark nor wound. [Annotation] Wang Chongmin notes: The character *ta* (wound) does not align with the preceding text. The *Taiping Yulan* (386 and 482) omits *ta*, suggesting it may be a superfluous interpolation. Hu Huaichen observes: The characters *hen ta* (mark and wound) may be transposed. [Pronunciation] *Mang e*: *mang e* sound. *Hen*: *hu en* cut. *Ta*: *ta da* cut.\n\nRelying on his strength and prowess, he regarded Lai Dan as but a fledgling chick. [Pronunciation] *Chu* is written as *chu* in the *Shiwen*, pronounced *zhu ju* cut. *Kou*: *kou* sound. A chick that must be fed is called *kou*; one that feeds itself is called *chu*.\n\nLai Dan’s friend Shen Ta—[Annotation] Wang Chongmin notes: The *Taiping Yulan* (344 and 482) renders this as *Shen Bao*, consistent below. [Pronunciation] *Ta* is written as *tuo* in the *Shiwen*, pronounced *tuo* or *qian*, with one variant reading *bao*—said, “Your resentment against Hei Mao has reached its limit. Hei Mao’s contempt for you has gone too far. [Pronunciation] *Yi*: *yi chi* cut. What plan shall you devise?” Lai Dan, tears streaming, replied, “I beg you to devise one for me.” [Pronunciation] *Wei*: *yu wei* cut.\n\nShen Ta said, “I have heard that your ancestor, Kong Zhou of Wei, obtained a treasured sword of the Yin Emperor. When a mere boy wore it—[Annotation] *Fu* (wore) and *pei* (wore at the waist) share an ancient pronunciation, a case of loan characters. [Pronunciation] *Tong* is written as *tong* in the *Shiwen*, pronounced *tong*—he repelled the masses of three armies. Why not seek it?” [Exegesis] The most refined objects of Heaven and Earth restrain the multitudes through awe alone. If their merit lay in cutting and severing, they would not be the most refined.\n\nLai Dan then journeyed to Wei, where he met Kong Zhou. Assuming the role of a servant-charioteer, he first offered his wife and children, then stated his desire. Kong Zhou said, “I possess three swords, any of which you may choose. None can kill a man—[Annotation] *Sha ren* (kill a man) refers to killing a man outright. Let me first describe their forms. The first is called *Han Guang* (Containing Light): though gazed upon, it cannot be seen; when wielded, its presence is unknown.”\n\nWhere it strikes, it leaves no trace—*mijnian* without boundary.\n\n[Variant Notes] The *Jifu* edition, *Daozang* unannotated edition, and Lin Xiyi’s edition all read “其有” (*qí yǒu*) for “其所触也.” Wang Chongmin observes that the two characters are transposed. The *Leiju* (60) omits the character “有,” likely because the inverted text made no sense, and the compiler excised “有” by conjecture. The *Jifu* edition’s “其有” is correct. Wang Shumin argues that omitting “有” or reading “其有” are both incorrect; “有” should belong to the preceding line as a caesura. “运之不知有” (*yùn zhī bù zhī yǒu*) parallels the earlier “视之不可见” (*shì zhī bù kě jiàn*). The phrasing of “其所触也，泯然无际” matches that of “其所触也窃窃然有声” and “其触物也騞然而过.” *Mijnian* without boundary: the *Shiwen* glosses *mǐn* as *wángrěn* (亡忍切); when it passes through things, they remain unaware.\n\nThe second is called *Chengying* (Bearing Shadow). At the cusp of dawn’s first light or the threshold of dusk’s dimness, when facing north to observe it, one perceives only a faint presence, as if something lingers—*dàndàn* as though a form exists. The *Shiwen* glosses *dàn* as *yàn* (艳). Yet its shape eludes recognition. Where it strikes, it emits a faint sound—*qièqièrán*.\n\n[Variant Notes] Wang Chongmin notes that the *Jifu* edition reads “焉” (*yān*) for “然” (*rán*). Earlier, the text states, “北面而察之，淡淡焉若有物存” (*dàndànyān ruò yǒu wù cún*), where *yān* and *rán* are synonymous; “淡淡焉” is equivalent to “淡淡然.” He suspects “窃窃然” was originally “窃窃焉,” and the *Jifu* edition preserves the older reading of the *Liezi*. Wang Shumin counters that the *Daozang* unannotated edition and Lin Xiyi’s edition also read “焉,” but the original text likely used “然.” “窃窃然” aligns with the earlier “泯然” and later “騞然.” Wang’s argument is incorrect. When it passes through things, they suffer no harm.\n\nThe third is called *Xiaolian*. By day, one sees its shadow but not its light—[note] its color is the same as the sun and moon. By night, one sees its light but not its form—[note] this refers to its illumination. Lu Wenchang notes: The *Daozang* edition reads “夜” (*yè*, night) for “也” (*yě*) in the annotation. When it strikes an object, it passes with a *huōrán* sound—[note] *huō* is pronounced *xiūbì*. Liu Wu states: *Huōrán* describes the swiftness of a blade’s passage. Precisely because the blade passes so swiftly is it a treasured sword. The *Shiwen* reads: *Huō* is pronounced *hūmài*, the sound of breaking. As it passes, the wound closes instantly, so swift is its strike that the blade draws no blood.\n\nThese three treasures have been passed down for thirteen generations—[note] *chuán* is pronounced *zhuān*—yet they have never been put to use—[note] they cannot harm things. They are encased and stored away—Lu Wenchang notes: The *Daozang* edition reads “柙” (*xiá*) for “匣” (*xiá*). The *Shiwen* reads “柙,” stating: *xiá* is equivalent to *xiá*. The seals have never been broken.\n\nLai Dan said: “Even so, I must request the lowest of them.”\n\nKong Zhou then sent his wife and children away and fasted for seven days. During a moment of partial clarity between clouds—[note] *Yan* signifies brightness. Sun Yirang states: The *Shuowen*’s *ri* section defines *yan* as “sky clear.” The *Hanshu*’s “Tianwen Zhi” reads: “At the hour of *bu*, the sky is *yan*” (i.e., clear). The *Hanfeizi*’s “Wai Chu Shuo Zuo” states: “After rain ceases and the sun emerges, one gazes upon the space between *yan* and *yin*,” which aligns with this meaning. “Between *yan* and *yin*” refers to the state between clear and overcast, not dusk. Zhang’s annotation errs here. Bo Jun notes: The *Huainanzi*’s “Miucheng” chapter reads: “The gleaming sun knows *yan*; the harmonious *yin* knows rain.” The *Wen Xuan*’s “Yang Xiong’s *Yu Lie Fu*” states: “The sky is clear, the sun *yan*.” Its commentary cites Xu Shen’s annotation from the *Huainanzi*: “*Yan* is where there are no clouds.” Thus, *yan-yin* is equivalent to *qing-yin*, concurring with Sun’s interpretation.—he knelt and presented the lowest-grade sword. Lai Dan bowed twice, received it, and departed. [note] As it could be grasped and seen, he accepted the lowest. [Explanation] The more precious the implement, the deeper its harm to things. The utmost Dao and utmost refinement injure nothing. Lai Dan then took the sword and followed Black Egg. At that moment, Black Egg was drunk and reclining beneath the window—Wu Kaisheng states: *Shi* should be read as *zhi* (to encounter). Bo Jun notes: *Shi* ought to be read as in the *Lunyu*’s “Yang Huo”: “Confucius *shi* their absence,” meaning “to wait for.” Further, the *Shu Chao* (122), *Shi Lei Fu* (13), and *Taiping Yulan* (344) all read “reclining beneath the window,” and judging by the earlier phrase “reclining beneath his wife’s loom,” the version with “reclining” is correct.—and struck him three times from neck to waist. The *Shiwen* reads “waist” as *yao*, pronounced *yu xiao*, with the same pronunciation below. Black Egg did not stir. Lai Dan, believing Black Egg dead—Bo Jun notes: The *Taiping Yulan* (344) omits the character “之,” which is correct—hastened away. The *Shiwen* reads *qu* as *qu* (to hurry). At the gate, he encountered Black Egg’s son and struck him three times, as if thrusting into emptiness. Black Egg’s son was laughing and said: “Why are you so foolish as to beckon me thrice?” Yu Yue states: The *Shuowen*’s *shou* section defines *zhao* as “to summon with the hand.” Black Egg’s son did not see Lai Dan striking him with the sword but only saw him raising his hand as if beckoning, hence his words: “Why are you so foolish as to beckon me thrice?” The *Shiwen* notes: “One version reads *nian*,” which is a scribal error and should not be forced into interpretation. The *Shiwen* reads: *Zhao* in one version is *nian*, pronounced *nu jian*, meaning “to pick up an object with the fingers,” and also pronounced *dian*. Realizing the sword could not kill, Lai Dan sighed and returned home.\n\nBlack Egg, upon waking, angrily rebuked his wife: “You got me drunk and exposed me, causing my throat to seize and my waist to stiffen.” Xu Weiyu states: The *Shuowen*’s *kou* section defines *ai* as “the throat.” The *Fangyan* says: “*Ai* means choking. In Qin and Jin, it may also be called *ai* or *ye*.” The *Shuowen* defines *ye* as “food blocking the passage.” The *Odes*’ “Wang Feng” reads: “My heart is as if choked,” and the Mao commentary explains: “*Ye* means grief that cannot be stilled.” The meaning of *ai* as an ailment is the same. Choking with grief that cannot be stilled refers to the throat constricting and the breath becoming disordered. The *Shiwen* notes: “*Ai* is pronounced *yi*, referring to the upper throat.”\n\nHis son said: “Last night, when Lai Dan came, he encountered me at the gate and beckoned me three times, which also caused my body to ail and my limbs to stiffen.” The *Shiwen* reads “*qiang*” as “*qiang*,” noting: “*Qiang* is pronounced *qi liang*.”\n\n“Surely he despises me!”\n\n**[Exegesis]**\nThe person who has attained the utmost Dao is unharmed by the myriad things, nor can the harm of the myriad things injure them. Thus, venomous creatures do not sting, and fierce beasts do not seize. Even the most refined essences of things cannot cause harm. Laozi said: “Their spirit does not harm others.” For this reason, the sage values knowledge—why? Because it does not harm the myriad things.\n\nThe *Shiwen* notes: “*Yan* is pronounced *yu ran*, and the original character is also written as *ya*, pronounced *wu xia*.\"\n\nKing Mu of Zhou launched a great expedition against the Western Rong. The Western Rong presented a *kunwu* sword—the *Shiwen* notes: \"*Kunwu* is a dragon sword.\" The *Hetu* states: \"On Yingzhou there are many piled stones, called *kunwu*, which can be forged into swords.\" The *Shizi* says: \"The *kunwu* sword can cut jade.\" They also presented fire-washed cloth—the *Shiwen* notes: \"*Huan* is pronounced *huan*.\" The *Yiwu Zhi* records: \"In the kingdom of Xintiao there is a Fire Continent, where trees and rats grow; their fur and pelts are woven into cloth called fire-washed cloth.\"\n\nThe sword was a *chi* and a *zhi* in length—the *Shiwen* notes: \"*Zhi* is pronounced *zhi*, and eight *cun* make one *zhi*.\" Its blade was tempered steel with a red edge, and when used, it cut jade as easily as slicing mud.\n\n**Bo Jun’s note:** The *Bowu Zhi* cites the *Zhou Shu*: \"The Western Regions presented fire-washed cloth, and the Kunwu presented a jade-cutting knife. When the fire-washed cloth is soiled, it is burned, and it becomes clean again. The jade-cutting knife (these two characters are supplied from the *Taiping Yulan*, chapter 345) cuts jade like [missing character].’ In Han times, fire-washed cloth was presented, but the knife was never heard of.\"\n\nThe fire-washed cloth, when washed, must be cast into fire. **Wang Shumin says:** The *Taiping Yulan* (chapter 820) reads \"its cloth\" instead of \"fire-washed cloth,\" matching the syntax of the earlier phrase \"its sword was a *chi* and a *zhi* in length.\" When the cloth is in fire, it takes on the color of flame; when soiled, it resumes its cloth-like hue. Taken from the fire and shaken, it gleams as if pure snow. **Annotation:** This is as stated in the *Zhou Shu*. The *Shiwen* writes \"*hao*\" as \"*hao*,\" noting: \"Pronounced *gao*, or also written as *hao*, *hu lao* cut.\"\n\nThe Crown Prince believed no such thing existed and that those who transmitted this account were deluded. **Xiao Shu said:** \"The Crown Prince was indeed obstinate in his self-assurance and hasty in dismissing reason!\"\n\n**Annotation:** This chapter concludes here, and the discussion of the jade-cutting knife and fire-washed cloth serves to demonstrate that all the preceding records are factual, for even these two objects are not fabrications.\n\n**[Exegesis]**\nThat metal cannot cut jade is not due to the blade’s dullness; that cloth cannot be washed in fire without burning is due to the object’s peculiar nature. Within heaven and earth, among the multitude of the ten thousand things, some can be sought through reason, while others lie beyond reason’s reach. Thus, though jade is hard, it has a grain that can be carved; though a sword is iron, it has an edge that must sever. When an edge that must sever meets a thing with a grain that can be carved, if it does not penetrate, it is merely because the blade is not supremely sharp—not that there is no principle by which it can cut. Since such things already exist, why doubt them?\n\nMoreover, among the categories of animals and plants, their natures differ: some arise through water and fire, while others perish through them. Thus, the mice of Fire Mountain come to life through fire, and the beasts of Wind Birth live through wind; man depends on empty space to stand, just as fish depend on water to exist. Now, the fire-washed cloth is neither ramie nor hemp. Though its name matches that of Chinese cloth, its fire and the fur of fire-mice are one and the same—what here is worthy of wonder? Those who cling stubbornly to their own certainty are simply ignorant!\n\n**[Exegesis]**\nAfter \"neither ramie nor hemp\" should follow \"made from fire-mouse fur\" (four characters), here omitted following the *Four Exegeses* edition. Also, after \"matches that of Chinese cloth,\" the character \"fire\" is absent, and after \"and,\" the three characters \"the fur of fire-mice are one\" are missing; these have been restored following the *Four Exegeses* edition.\n\nLu Wench’ao notes: The annotation’s \"through\" (*yin*) in the *Zang* edition appears as \"by\" (*you*), which is synonymous.\nGuang Congxie observes: This refers to the *Dian Lun* of Emperor Wen of Wei’s discussion of fire-washed cloth. The \"royal son\" is Emperor Wen of Wei, indicating that this book still saw interpolations as late as the Jian’an era.\nYu Zhengxie states: The *Commentary* to the *Book of Later Han*’s \"Account of the Southwest Barbarians\" cites the *Shen Yi Jing*: \"In the south there is a Fire Mountain, where grows an unburning tree that blazes day and night. Within the fire dwell mice weighing a hundred *jin*, their fur over two *chi* long, fine as silk, and white. Spun into cloth, if soiled, it is cleansed by fire.\" The *Taiping Guangji* records the *Liang Si Gong Ji*: \"A merchant from Nanhai brought three bolts of fire-washed cloth: two were made from the bark of trees, one from the fur of fire-mice. The wood was stiff, the fur soft.\" The *Justice* to the *Records of the Grand Historian*’s \"Account of Dayuan\" cites Wan Zhen’s *Nanzhou Zhi*: \"On the island of Sidiao in the sea of Da Qin grows a tree whose bark, stripped in winter, is spun into cloth indistinguishable from hemp or burnt cloth, its hue slightly green-black. If soiled, it becomes immaculate when placed in fire—hence the name fire-washed cloth. The people of Qin call it the bark of the *dingzhongshenjian* tree.\" It also cites the *Kuodi Zhi*: \"In the Fire Mountain country, within the fire, are white mouse fur and tree bark, spun into fire-washed cloth.\" Ren Fang’s *Shu Yi Ji* states: \"In the south, the Fire Mountain burns from the fourth to the twelfth month. When the fire dies, grass and trees sprout branches and leaves; when it revives, they shed. The bark is spun into fire-washed cloth.\" Kuang Lu’s *Chi Ya* notes: \"Among the Miao, fire-washed cloth comes in three kinds: *bifang* hemp, *zhurong* wood, and fire-mouse fur.\" As for its use, the *Commentary* to the *Book of Later Han*’s \"Account of the Western Barbarians\" cites Fu Zi: \"Elders say that during the reign of Emperor Huan of Han, Liang Ji made a robe of fire-washed cloth. When entertaining guests, he poured wine and feigned soiling it. Burning it, the grime vanished, the fire extinguished, and it emerged gleaming white as if washed in water.\" Cai Tao’s *Tiewei Shan Congtan* records: \"Fire-washed cloth resembles cotton cloth, its color dark green. Cast into fire, it turns pure white. After the Xuanhe and Zhenghe eras, it arrived in abundance, and the imperial storehouse stitched it into kerchiefs, bedding, skirts, and robes.\" Thus, it first reached China in the Eastern Han, becoming common Southern merchandise by the Song. Jiang Shaoshu’s *Yunshi Zhai Bitan* observes: \"Fire-washed cloth is slightly white; when brushed by hand, it leaves powder on the fingers, like touching a butterfly’s wings.\" This, then, is cloth spun from bark, its residual oil still present—a mundane thing. Today, in the borderlands of Yuexi Hall in Sichuan, within the crevices of the Wuman Mountains, grows a grass root called *buxiumu* (\"undecaying wood\"), its nature purely yin. Woven into cloth, it is washed with fire. The *Sichuan Tongzhi* states: \"Only the destitute use it.\" The *Baopuzi*’s \"On Immortals\" records: \"Emperor Wen of Wei claimed the world had no jade-cutting knives or fire-washed cloth. When he wrote the *Dian Lun* and asserted this, before long both objects arrived. The emperor sighed and promptly destroyed the work.\" Now, examining the text: \"Emperor Wen said that the notion of fire-mouse fur as cloth, cleansed by fire when soiled, was false. Fire has no power to nurture life—how could mice live within it? He had the *Dian Lun* engraved at the Imperial Academy. During Emperor Ming’s reign, one who presented this cloth as tribute caused the stele to be chiseled away.\"\n\nThe *Liezi*’s \"Tang Wen\" chapter likewise records this. The *Liezi*, a work from the Jin dynasty attributed to Wang Fu and Ge Hong, speaks of sages in its \"Zhong Ni\" chapter and of fire-washed cloth in its \"Tang Wen\" chapter. Cen Zhongmian notes: \"Fire-washed cloth is asbestos, later called 'undecaying wood' and now known as 'stone floss.' Persians and Arabs were well acquainted with it. The Central Asian variety originates from Badakhshan, once a vassal region of China. This substance possesses fibrous structures resembling hemp, from which cloth, paper, and kerchiefs may be crafted.\"\n\nBo Jun observes: The *Erya*’s *Shi Gu* commentary, citing the *Shizi*’s \"Guang Ze\" chapter with the line *\"Huangzi gui zhong\"* (\"The august son cherishes the inner\"), suggests—if credible—that a certain \"august son\" predated Shi Jiao. Yet this \"august son\" unmistakably refers to Emperor Wen of Wei. Further, *The Complete Prose of the Jin Dynasty* includes the *\"Fu on the Wondrous Cloth of Ban Ju\"*, whose preface states that in the second year of Taikang (281 CE), the Da Qin kingdom presented tribute, and the fire-washed cloth was particularly marvelous, prompting the composition of the *fu*—this was the same fire-washed cloth.\n\nAnother note: In the phrase *\"fu jin zhi bu neng qie yu zhe ji bu zhi bu neng huan yu huo\"* (\"that metal cannot cut jade and cloth cannot be washed in fire\"), the two *\"bu\"* (\"not\") characters appear to be superfluous. The *Exegesis* glosses *\"duan\"* as pronounced *da guan*. *Collected Exegeses of the Liezi*, Volume Six, \"Li Ming\" (\"Force and Fate\").\n\nThe *Annotation* states: \"Fate\" refers to the inevitable term, the inherently fixed portion. Though this matter has yet to be verified, this principle is already so. To believe that longevity or early death depends on nurture and care, or that success or failure hinges on wisdom and effort, is to be deluded about the principles of Heaven.\n\nThe *Exegesis* states: \"Fate\" is the fixed portion, which cannot be realized without effort; \"effort\" is the power of advancement, which cannot be fulfilled without fate. Those endowed with fate must rely on effort; those who exert effort may or may not align with their fate. There are things effort cannot achieve—this is the absence of fate; relying on fate without striving is merely awaiting the right moment. Those who trust fate but not effort err greatly; those who trust effort but not fate are also not correct.\n\nThe *Exegesis* notes: *Fen* (portion) is pronounced *fu wen*; *yao* (early death) is pronounced *yu zhao*; *xi* (hinge) is read as *ji*.\n\nEffort said to Fate: \"What is your merit compared to mine?\"\nFate replied: \"What merit do you have over things that you dare compare yourself to me?\"\nEffort said: \"Longevity or early death, success or failure, nobility or baseness, wealth or poverty—these are all within my power.\"\nFate said: \"Peng Zu’s wisdom did not surpass that of Yao and Shun, yet he lived eight hundred years.\"\nKong Guangsen notes: Peng Zu was the ancestor of the Peng clan. The Peng clan included several states: Da Peng, Shi Wei, and Zhu Ji. Da Peng served the Xia and Yu dynasties and became a lord under the Shang, but was destroyed during the reign of Wu Ding. Thus, \"Peng Zu lived eight hundred years\" refers to the Peng state lasting eight hundred years before its fall, not that Jian himself was immortal.\nYan Kejun notes: In the *Discourses of Zheng*, Historian Bo said: \"Among the eight descendants of Zhu Rong, Da Peng and Shi Wei were lords under the Shang.\" The Peng clan included Peng Zu, Shi Wei, and Zhu Ji, all of whom were destroyed by the Shang. Wei Zhao explains: \"Da Peng was the third son of Lu Zhong, named Jian, who founded the Peng clan and was enfeoffed at Da Peng, hence called Peng Zu.\" He also explains: \"Peng Zu refers to Da Peng.\" The *Records of the Grand Historian: House of Chu* states: \"Lu Zhong had six sons; the third was Peng Zu.\" The *Collected Explanations* cites Yu Fan: \"His name was Jian; he founded the Peng clan, was enfeoffed at Da Peng, and was called Peng Zu.\" The *Index* cites the *Genealogical Records*: \"The third son was Jian Keng, known as Peng Zu.\" The *Book of Zhou: Explanation of Wheat* states: \"August Heaven pitied Yu and granted him the longevity of Peng, to rectify the Xia’s decline.\" The *Bamboo Annals* records: \"In the fifteenth year of Emperor Qi, Wu Guan rebelled in the West River. Peng Bo Shou led troops to suppress the West River and decisively defeated them.\" Thus, Peng Zu was a state name, namely Da Peng, which served as a regional lord under the Xia and Shang, one of the Five Hegemons of antiquity. It was enfeoffed during the Tang and Yu dynasties, passed through dozens of generations, lasted eight hundred years, and was destroyed by the Shang—this is the historical fact. \"Peng Zu lived eight hundred years\" is akin to saying the Xia lasted four hundred years, the Shang six hundred, and the Zhou eight hundred.\nMa Xulun notes: Kong and Yan’s explanations are correct. The *Zhuangzi: Free and Easy Wandering* states: \"Yet Peng Zu is still renowned for his longevity.\" It seems Zhuangzi also mistakenly believed Peng Zu lived seven or eight hundred years. This was a common saying of the time, which Zhuangzi followed, as did Xunzi.\nYan Yuan’s talent did not surpass that of ordinary people, yet he died at eighteen.\nThe character \"eighteen\" follows the Northern Song edition and the Shide Hall edition; the Zang, Sijie, Jifu, and Qin engravings of Lu’s commentary read \"forty-eight.\"\nHong Yi notes: The *Huainanzi: Spirit and Vitality* commentary by Gao You states: \"Yan Hui died at eighteen.\" The *Book of Later Han: Biography of Lang Yi* states: \"In the past, when Yanzi was eighteen, the world embraced benevolence.\" The *Baopuzi: Recluses* states: \"When Yan Hui died, Duke Ding of Lu was about to personally offer condolences and sent someone to ask Confucius.\" The *Baopuzi* also takes Yan Yuan as having died at eighteen, hence his death occurring during Duke Ding’s reign.\nBo Jun notes: The lifespan of Yan Yuan varies in ancient traditions. Though he was said to have died young, if we examine reliable records such as the *Zuozhuan* and *Records of the Grand Historian*, we can confidently assert that he did not die at eighteen. However, since this text is allegorical, it may adopt the shortest lifespan.\nConfucius’s virtue did not surpass that of the feudal lords, yet he was besieged in Chen and Cai.\n\nThe conduct of King Zhou of Yin did not surpass that of the Three Benevolent Ones, yet he occupied the throne. Bo Jun notes: The *Analects: Weizi* states: \"Weizi departed, Jizi became his slave, and Bigan remonstrated unto death. Confucius said: ‘Yin had three benevolent ones.’\" The *Exegesis* reads: *xing* (conduct), pronounced as in *xiameng*. Jizha held no rank in Wu. The *Exegesis* states: Jizha, a descendant of Taibo of Wu, was virtuous and yielded his position, abandoning his household to till the land. Later, he was enfeoffed at Yanling, hence styled Yanling Jizi. Tian Heng monopolized the state of Qi. Boyi and Shuqi starved at Shouyang, while the Ji clan grew wealthier than Zhan Qin. If these are within the power of your strength, why then do some live long while others die young, why are the sagely impoverished while the perverse prosper, why are the worthy debased while the foolish exalted, why are the good impoverished while the wicked enriched?\"\n\nLi replied: \"If it is as you say, then I have certainly no merit in relation to things, yet why do things fare thus? Is this then within your control?\" The *Daozang* unannotated edition and Lin Xiyi’s edition read \"若言\" (*ruo yan*, \"as you say\") as \"是言\" (*shi yan*, \"these words\"). Tao Hongqing said: The first \"邪\" (*ye*) should be read as \"也\" (*ye*, \"then\"). \"Yet why do things fare thus then?\" connects in meaning to the following sentence, saying: \"That things fare thus—is this within your control?\" For he first concedes his lack of merit and then counters with a question. Note that *ye* and *xie* were interchangeable in ancient usage.\n\nMing replied: \"Since it is called *ming* (fate/destiny), how can there be one who controls it? I simply push forth what is straight and entrust what is crooked. Some live long, some die young; some are impoverished, some prosper; some are exalted, some debased; some grow rich, some remain poor. That which is so without knowing why it is so—this is *ming*. How can it be controlled? How can I comprehend it? How can I comprehend it?\"\n\n[Note] This chapter elucidates that all things possess *ming*, rendering wisdom and effort futile. The *Yang Zhu* chapter speaks of people following their desires without restraint, implying that control does not derive from *ming*. The principles differ and appear contradictory. Yet amid the shifts between order and chaos, the clashes of love and hate, the myriad deceptions and complexities—who can fathom the causes of their excesses? Thus the sage preserves both perspectives without debate. This is to broadly uphold the teachings of names and rituals, for the origins of corruption cannot be entirely blocked. Some rely on deceit and force to defy the times and *ming*, as when the Lord of Chu inquired about the Zhou tripods, or when Wu Zhi caused chaos in Qi. Others feign natural integrity to pursue fame, as when Boyi and Shuqi starved on Mount Shouyang, or when Zhong You was minced in Wei. Therefore, Liezi presents these two extremes, allowing all things to seek their own center. If one attains this center, then the cunning and active will not disrupt their inherent allotment with power, nor will those who pride themselves on fame harm their bodily life through artificial restraint. The intent of these words lies precisely here. Alas! Can readers fail to examine this closely?\n\n**[Exegesis]**\n*Ming* is Heaven; *li* (force) is man. *Ming* can accomplish, *li* can move—hence it is called \"moving *ming*.\" Zhuangzi said: \"When one knows there is nothing to be done, one rests in it as *ming*.\" This is when *li* cannot move it. Confucius said: \"At fifty, I understood the *ming* of Heaven.\" \"He who does not understand *ming* cannot be a noble person.\" Yet when he traveled through the states on diplomatic missions, he longed to be a groom holding the whip—this was not forgetting *li*.\n\n**Yang Bojun’s note:** The exegesis cites Zhuangzi from the \"Human World\" chapter, omitting the word *er* (而) after *he* (何). The Shidetang edition mistakenly writes *si* (似) as *yi* (以), *cun* (存) as *qing* (情), and *xun* (殉) as *zhi* (殖). The *Shiwen* (Explanations of Characters) reads: *wu* (恶) as *wulu* (乌路切); *di* (适) as *di* (的); *xun* (殉) originally as *xun* (徇), meaning \"to seek\"; *hai* (醢) as *hai* (海); *kou* (叩) as *kou* (寇).\n\nBeigongzi said to Ximenzi: \"You and I live in the same age, yet people esteem you; we belong to the same clan, yet people respect you; we share the same appearance, yet people love you; we speak the same words, yet people employ yours; we act the same way, yet people trust you; we hold office together, yet you are honored; we farm together, yet you are wealthy; we trade together, yet you profit. I wear coarse hemp, *shuhe*, while you wear patterned brocade; I eat coarse grains, *zili*, while you eat fine millet and meat. I live in a thatched hut, while you dwell in a mansion with towering beams; I walk on foot, while you ride in a carriage drawn by four horses. At home, you are cheerful and seem to scorn me; in court, you are forthright and wear an air of disdain toward me. You do not visit me for favors, nor do we travel together—this has been the case for years. Do you consider your virtue superior to mine?\"\n\nXimenzi replied: \"I have no way of knowing the truth of this. You undertake affairs and meet with failure; I undertake affairs and meet with success—is this not proof of the difference in our *houbo* (thickness/thinness)?\"\n\n**[Annotation]** It refers to the thickness or thinness of virtue.\n\n**[Exegesis]** All my undertakings succeed, while all yours fail—thus the thickness or thinness of virtue is evident. Yet you claim we are equal. How thick-skinned you are!\n\nBeigongzi had no reply. He left in embarrassment and on the way encountered Master Dongguo. The master said: \"Where have you been, that you return with such halting steps and a look of deep shame?\"\n\nBeigongzi described what had happened. Master Dongguo said: \"I will relieve your shame. Let us go together to Ximen’s house and ask him.\" He said: \"Why do you so humiliate Beigongzi? Speak plainly.\"\n\n**Yang Bojun’s note:** *Gu* (固) should be read as *gu* (姑), meaning \"temporarily.\"\n\nXimenzi said: \"Beigongzi claims that our clans, ages, appearances, words, and conduct are the same, yet our status, wealth, and poverty differ. I told him: 'I have no way of knowing the truth. You undertake affairs and fail; I undertake affairs and succeed—is this not proof of the difference in our *houbo*? Yet you claim we are equal. How thick-skinned you are!'\"\n\nMaster Dongguo said: \"Your words on *houbo* refer only to differences in talent and virtue. My words on *houbo* differ from this. Beigongzi is thick in virtue but thin in *ming*; you are thick in *ming* but thin in virtue. Your success is not due to wisdom, nor is his failure due to folly. Both are of Heaven, not of man.\n\n**[Annotation]** This is the natural course of things, not due to human skill or clumsiness.\n\nYou take pride in your thick *ming*, while Beigongzi feels shame for his thick virtue.\"\n\n**Hu Huaichen’s note:** Since he knows his virtue is thick, he should not feel shame. Thus, \"feeling shame for thick virtue\" is textually unsound. It should read, \"feeling shame for thin *ming*.\" This is not a copyist’s error but a minor flaw in the original *Liezi* text.\n\n**Yang Bojun’s note:** Hu’s argument is debatable. Ancient texts often employ reciprocal phrasing—here, \"thick *ming*\" implies \"thin virtue,\" and \"thick virtue\" implies \"thin *ming*.\" Both fail to recognize the principle of inevitability.\n\n**Textual note:** The Zang, Jifu, Sijie, and Qin editions omit the word *yi* (矣). It is added here following the Northern Song and Shidetang editions. Also, *guran* (固然) may originally have been *ziran* (自然).\n\n**The *Shiwen* reads:** *fu* (夫) as *fu* (符).\n\nXimenzi said: \"Enough, Master!\"\n\n\"I dare not speak further.\"\n\n**[Annotation:]**\nHearing the principle, he submits.\n\n**[Exegesis:]**\nThat Ximenzi’s pursuit succeeded was *ming*; that Beigongzi’s did not was also *ming*. Unaware of *ming*, one bears an air of self-importance; knowing *ming*, one harbors no anxiety or shame. Attainment or failure—neither hinges on wisdom or folly, talent or virtue. That Ximenzi dared not speak further was because, knowing *ming* had favored him, he dared not presume upon his virtue.\n\n**[Phonetic Gloss:]**\n*Fu* (復), *fúyòu* cut.\n\nWhen Beigongzi returned home, he donned his coarse hempen robe, its warmth like that of fox or raccoon-dog fur;\n**[Phonetic Gloss:]**\n*Yi* (衣), *yùjì* cut. *Húhè* (狐貉), pronounced *húhè*.\n\nhe took his rough beans, their savor like that of fine rice and millet;\n**[Phonetic Gloss:]**\n*Róngshū* (茙菽), pronounced *róngshū*. The *Erya* states: *róngshū* are called *rěnshū*, that is, barbarian beans. The *Guanzi* records: Duke Huan of Qi, journeying north to Mount Tai, gathered winter onions and *róngshū*, then spread them throughout the land. Zheng Xuan notes: these are soybeans.\n\nhe sheltered beneath his thatched hut as though beneath a vast mansion’s eaves;\n**[Phonetic Gloss:]**\n*Bì* (庇), *bìlì* cut.\n\nhe rode his thornwood carriage as though adorned with a patterned chariot.\n**[Textual Note:]**\n*Bì* (筚) appears in all other editions as *bì* (荜). Here, *bì* (筚) is the correct character; the *Zuozhuan* writes *bì* (筚), and the *Records of the Grand Historian*, in the \"Hereditary House of Chu,\" writes *bì* (荜). The *Phonetic Gloss* writes *bì* (荜), noting: *bì* (荜), *bì* tone; *lù* (辂), *lù* tone. The *Zuozhuan* states: \"a firewood cart.\" **[Yang Bojun’s Note:]**\nThe *Zuozhuan*, in the twelfth year of Duke Xuan, reads: \"thornwood carts and tattered garments to open the mountain forests.\" Du Yu’s commentary: \"*bìlù* (筚路) means a firewood cart.\" The *Phonetic Gloss* does not distinguish between the transmitted text and the commentary.\n\nFor the rest of his life, he remained carefree,\n**[Phonetic Gloss:]**\n*Yōu* (逌), *yóu* tone. *Yōurán* (逌然) describes a self-contented demeanor. The same pronunciation appears in the later \"Yang Zhu\" chapter.\n\nunaware of glory or disgrace residing in others or in himself.\n**[Annotation:]**\nOnce the principle is grasped, external things—whether abundant or meager—cannot sway the mind.\n\n**[Exegesis:]**\nKnowing *ming*, one feels neither anxiety nor shame, nor does one discern the thickness or thinness of virtue.\n\n**[Phonetic Gloss:]**\n*Gài* (概), *gǔdài* cut.\n\nMaster Dongguo, hearing this, said: \"Beigongzi has slumbered long indeed! A single word awakened him—how easily roused!\"\n**[Exegesis:]**\n\"Slumbered\" means he had not yet awakened. When he did awaken, it was merely to the ordinary.\n**[Textual Note:]**\n*Wù* (悟) appears in the Northern Song edition as *wù* (寤); the Zang and Shidetang editions write *dá* (怛). Yu Yue notes: *dá* (怛) should be read as *dàn* (旦). In the *Mang* ode of the *Book of Songs*, \"the earnest oath *dàndàn* (旦旦)\" is cited in the *Shuowen* under the \"heart\" radical as *xīnshì* □□. □ is an alternate form of *dá* (怛). Thus, *dá* (怛) and *dàn* (旦) were interchangeable in antiquity.\n\nThose who slumber awaken at the break of dawn. Beigongzi had slumbered long before suddenly awakening—hence the saying, \"How easily dawned upon!\" The *Shiwen* notes *dàn* (旦) as *dāng gē* cut, though its pronunciation remains uncertain. Some write it as *wù* (悟), a later emendation by those who failed to grasp its meaning.\n\n**Bo Jun’s Note:** According to Lu’s commentary, the *Chongxuan* edition also writes *dá* (怛). The *Shiwen* renders *wù* (悟) as *dá* (怛), stating: \"*Dá* (怛), *dāng gē* cut; writing it as *wù* (悟) is incorrect.\"\n\nGuan Yiwu and Bao Shuya shared a bond of profound kinship. **Bo Jun’s Note:** In the *Mencius* (\"Gaozi, Part II\"), it is written: \"When his elder brother drew the bow to shoot him, he wept and pleaded with him. There was no other reason—it was kinship.\" The commentary explains: \"*Qī* (戚) means 'intimacy.'\"\n\nThe *Shiwen* states: Guan Yiwu and Bao Shuya were both natives of Yingchuan. Bao Ya was a grandee of Qi, his tomb located in Yingzhou. **Bo Jun’s Note:** The *Shiwen*’s \"Bao Ya\" should read \"Bao Shu.\"\n\nThey both resided in Qi. Guan Yiwu served Prince Jiu. The *Shiwen* notes: *Jiǔ* (纠), *guī yǒu* cut. Bao Shuya served Prince Xiaobai. The Qi royal clan was rife with favoritism, with legitimate and illegitimate lines treated equally. **Note:** Qi Xigong’s younger brother, Yizhong, fathered Prince Wuzhi. Xigong doted on him, granting him rites and rank equal to the crown prince. The *Shiwen* notes: *Dí* (嫡), *dí* sound. *Xī* (僖), *xǔ qí* cut, sometimes written as *lí* (厘). The people of the state feared chaos.\n\nGuan Zhong and Shao Hu escorted Prince Jiu in flight to Lu. **Note:** Jiu was Duke Xiang’s younger brother. The *Shiwen* notes: *Shào* (召) is written as *Shào* (邵) in some editions. Bao Shu escorted Prince Xiaobai in flight to Ju. **Note:** Xiaobai was Jiu’s younger brother. The *Shiwen* notes: *Jǔ* (莒), *jǔ* sound.\n\nLater, Prince Wuzhi staged a rebellion. **Note:** After Duke Xiang ascended, he demoted Wuzhi’s rank and attire, leading Wuzhi to kill the duke and seize the throne. The people of the state soon killed him. The *Shiwen* notes: *Chù* (绌), *chù* sound, also *shì hū* cut. *Zhì* (秩), *zhì* sound. *Shā* (杀), *shì* sound.\n\nWith Qi lacking a ruler, the two princes vied to enter. Guan Yiwu clashed with Xiaobai in Ju, shooting him in the belt hook along the way. The *Shiwen* notes: *Shè* (射), *shí yì* cut. *Zhòng* (中), *dīng zhòng* cut. Once Xiaobai ascended the throne—**Note:** Xiaobai was Duke Huan—he coerced Lu into killing Prince Jiu. The *Shiwen* writes *xié* (胁) as *lā* (搚), noting: \"Also written as *xié* (胁).\" Shao Hu died for him, while Guan Yiwu was imprisoned. **Note:** Qi informed Lu: \"Prince Jiu was our brother; we could not bear to execute him ourselves, so we ask you to kill him. Shao Hu and Guan Zhong were our enemies; we wish to savor their flesh as mincemeat. If you refuse, we will destroy Lu.\" Fearing this, Lu killed Prince Jiu. Shao Hu took his own life, while Guan Zhong requested imprisonment.\n\nBao Shuya told Duke Huan: \"Guan Yiwu is capable—he can govern the state.\" The *Shiwen* notes: *Zhì* (治), *zhí lì* cut. Duke Huan replied: \"He is my enemy; I wish to kill him.\" Bao Shuya said: \"I have heard that a worthy ruler bears no private grudges. Moreover, one who can serve his lord can also serve a ruler. If you seek hegemony, **The *Shiwen* notes:** *Wáng* (王), *yú kuàng* cut. none but Yiwu will suffice. You must pardon him!\" The *Shiwen* notes: *Shě* (舍), *shì* sound. Duke Huan then summoned Guan Zhong. Lu returned him to Qi, where Bao Shuya welcomed him beyond the outskirts and freed him from captivity. Duke Huan treated him with ritual propriety—**Note:** Bao Shu personally met Guan Zhong at Tangfu, removing his shackles, and presented him to Duke Huan at Qi’s outskirts. The *Shiwen* notes: *Fù* (阜), *fù* sound. Jia Kui said: \"Tangfu lies on Lu’s northern border.\" Du Yu said: \"It is a Qi territory in Dongguan.\" *Jiàn* (见), *xián biàn* cut. **Bo Jun’s Note:** Tangfu is located northwest of present-day Mengyin County, Linyi Prefecture, Shandong—Qi territory. He was placed above Gao and Guo, while Bao Shuya humbled himself beneath him. **The *Shiwen* notes:** *Xià* (下), *xiá jià* cut. Entrusted with state governance, he was styled \"Zhongfu.\" The *Shiwen* notes: *Fù* (父), *fǔ* sound. Duke Huan thus became a hegemon.\n\nGuan Zhong once sighed: \"In my youth, when I was poor and destitute, I once traded with Bao Shu. The *Shiwen* notes: *Gǔ* (贾), *gǔ* sound. I kept more of the profits for myself, yet Bao Shu did not think me greedy—he knew I was impoverished. I once devised a plan for Bao Shu that led to great hardship. The *Shiwen* notes: *Wéi* (为), *yú wěi* cut. He did not think me foolish—he knew some times are favorable, others not. I served thrice and was thrice dismissed by my lord; Bao Shu did not think me worthless—he knew I had not met my time. I fought thrice and fled thrice; Bao Shu did not think me cowardly—he knew I had an aged mother. When Prince Jiu was defeated, Shao Hu died for him while I endured imprisonment and humiliation. Bao Shu did not think me shameless—he knew I did not scorn minor setbacks but felt shame if my name **Wang Shumin notes:** The *Caotang Shiji* (7) includes the word *gōng* (功) before *míng* (名), which should be followed. The *Records of the Grand Historian* (\"Biographies of Guan and Yan\") and Liu Xiang’s *Preface to the Guanzi* also include *gōng* (功). failed to resound throughout the world. My parents gave me life, but Bao Shu truly knew me!\"\n\nThis is why the world praises Guan and Bao’s fine friendship and Xiaobai’s skill in employing talent. Yet in truth, there was no fine friendship, nor was there skill in employing talent. That there was no fine friendship and no skill in employing talent does not mean there exists some other fine friendship or skill in employing talent. **Note:** This clarifies that in principle, there is no fine friendship or skill in employing talent—this is not limited to Guan, Bao, or Duke Huan. **Exegesis:** When one’s fate aligns with its use, one attains success through friendship—this does not imply some other fine friendship or skill in employing talent. Thus, relying on talent to gain office is a matter of fate, while achieving success through friendship is a matter of effort.\n\nNot only does Heaven’s timing play its part, but even those who succeed through human planning and effort ultimately return to fate. When fate arrives, Bao Shu could not but exert all his strength, and Duke Huan could not but employ him—all was fate! Shujun notes: Below \"there exists some other skill in employing talent,\" a \"者\" should likely be added.\n\nZhao Hu was not capable of dying, yet could not but die; Bao Shu was not capable of recommending the worthy, yet could not but recommend; Duke Huan was not capable of employing his foe, yet could not but employ him. **Annotation:** All these were driven by unseen forces, not governed by human effort. **Exegesis:** Fate is perfected through effort, and effort is perfected through fate—there is no partiality in this.\n\nThe original text read \"human principle\" (人理) for \"human effort\" (人力), but the present version follows the *Zang* edition’s correction.\n\nWhen Guan Yiwu fell ill, Duke Huan visited him and said, \"Your illness has become grave—it cannot be concealed. **Annotation:** The severity of the illness leaves no room for concealment. **Exegesis:** When death approaches, it cannot be denied. The *Shide Tang* edition reads \"the illness is severe\" (病疾矣). Yu Yue argues: The *Lu Chongxuan* edition has \"病\" instead of \"疾,\" which should be followed. The *Zhuangzi*'s *Xu Wugui* chapter concurs. Shujun notes: The Northern Song edition, *Zang* edition, *Jifu* edition, and *Sijie* edition all read \"病,\" as do the *Yanzi* and *Zhiyou* quotations. The original likely read \"疾病.\" The *Shuowen* states: \"疾 means illness; 病 means illness worsening.\" In ancient texts, severe illness is always termed *jibing* (疾病). For example, the *Lunyu* (*Zihan* chapter) says, \"When the Master’s illness worsened, Zilu had his disciples act as retainers\" (Zheng Xuan’s note: \"病 refers to illness growing more severe\"). The *Yili* (*Jixi Ji*) states, \"In severe illness, both inner and outer chambers are swept clean\" (Zheng Xuan’s note: \"Severe illness is called 病\"). The *Zuozhuan* (*Xuan* 15th year) records: \"When ill, Meng Ke said, 'You must marry her!' When the illness worsened, he said, 'You must bury her with me!' Upon his death, Meng Ke married her, saying, 'When illness worsens, one’s mind is disordered—I follow what is proper.'\" The *Zuozhuan* (*Xiang* 19th year) also states: \"When the Marquis of Qi fell ill, Cui Zhu secretly welcomed Guang; when the illness worsened, he enthroned him.\" The *Zuozhuan* (*Huan* 5th year) further notes: \"When the Duke’s illness worsened, chaos erupted.\" All these are examples of *jibing* (疾病) used together. The *Lüshi Chunqiu* (*Zhijie* chapter) likewise says, \"Your illness has become grave—what teachings will you leave me?\" This is further confirmation. The *Shide Tang* edition reads \"病疾,\" a reversal of the proper order; later scholars, failing to recognize this, hastily altered it to \"病病.\" Yu Yue’s argument is incorrect. The *Shiwen* notes: *fu* (復) is read as *fuyou*.\n\n\"When it comes to a fatal illness, to whom should I entrust the state?\" Wang Chongmin argues: Zhang’s annotation states, \"The severity of the illness leaves no room for concealment.\" Based on this, the original text’s \"可不\" should be transposed. The *Guanzi* (*Jie* and *Xiaochen* chapters) both read \"不可讳.\" Zhang’s interpretation, taking \"可不讳云\" as a single phrase and explaining it as \"cannot be concealed,\" is also incorrect. The word *yun* (云) should be read as the start of the next clause, meaning \"like\" or \"as if.\" See the *Shici* for examples. The *Zhiyou* omits these four characters, likely because its compiler did not grasp their meaning.\n\nShujun notes: Wang’s argument is sound. The *Liji* (*Tangong*) states: \"When Cheng Zigao was gravely ill, Qing Yi entered and asked, 'Your illness has become critical—if it reaches a fatal stage, what then?'\" Here, \"云至于大病\" parallels \"如至乎大病也.\" The *Shiwen* notes: *wu* (恶) is read as *wu*; *zhu* (属) is read as *zhu*.\n\nGuan Yiwu asked, \"Whom does Your Lordship desire?\" The *Shiwen* notes: *yu* (欤) is read as *yu*.\n\nDuke Huan said, \"Bao Shuya would be suitable.\"\nGuan Yiwu replied, \"He is not. His character is that of a pure and upright gentleman. **Annotation:** He merely keeps himself unsullied. The \"也\" after \"人\" is added following the *Zang* edition to match the structure of \"其为人也\" below. The *Shiwen* reads \"洁\" as \"絜,\" pronounced *jie*. Toward those who do not match his standards, he does not associate. **Annotation:** He seeks to align all things with his own virtue. If he hears of another’s fault, he never forgets it. **Annotation:** He cannot overlook flaws to record virtues. The *Shiwen* notes: *xia* (瑕) is pronounced *xia*.\n\nIf you appoint him to govern the state, above he will constrain his lord, and below he will oppose the people. **Annotation:** He will inevitably invoke the lord’s commands, but his Way is not expansive. If the Way is not expansive, he will oppose the people and fail to guide them. Wang Chongmin argues: The *Zhuangzi* (*Xu Wugui* chapter) reads \"治国\" instead of \"理国\"—this should also be \"治,\" altered to avoid taboo. The *Zhiyou* correctly reads \"治.\"\n\nHis offense against his lord will not be long in coming.\" The *Zhiyou* omits the \"也.\"\n\nDuke Huan said, \"Then who is suitable?\"\nGuan Yiwu replied, \"If you must choose, then Xi Peng is suitable. **Annotation:** He is not necessarily suitable, but there is no better option. The *Shiwen* notes: *xi* (隰) is pronounced *xi*.\n\nHis character is such that above he forgets his rank, and below he does not rebel. **Annotation:** Occupying a high position yet forgetting himself, he need not fear the people’s dispersal. Wang Chongmin argues: Zhang’s explanation is incorrect. The *Zhuangzi* reads \"上忘而下畔,\" with an extra \"不.\" *Pan* (畔) is interchangeable with *pan* (叛), meaning \"rebellious slander.\" *Pan* and *yan* (谚) are rhyming words, a common pairing in ancient speech.\"\n\nThe *Shi* *Dayi* *Huangyi* reads \"畔援,\" while the *Hanshu* *Xuzhuan* annotation cites it as \"畔换,\" and the *Wenxuan* *Weidu Fu* renders it as \"叛换.\" Sometimes it appears as the single word \"谚,\" as in the *Shangshu* *Wu Yi*: \"乃逸乃谚.\" The apocryphal Kong commentary states: \"叛谚不恭\" (\"rebellious slander is irreverent\"). In the *Lunyu* *Xianjin* chapter, it says: \"由也喭.\" Zheng Xuan’s annotation explains: \"Zilu’s conduct errs in rebellious slander\"—this is the meaning. At times, it appears as the single word \"畔.\" In the *Lunyu* *Yongye* chapter: \"君子博学于文，约之以礼，亦可以弗畔矣夫\" (following Yu Yue’s *Qunjing Pingyi* reading), and in the *Liezi*: \"上忘而下叛,\" this is the usage. The *Shi* *Zheng* commentary states: \"畔援 means overbearing.\" The *Han Shi* reads: \"武强也\" (\"martial and strong\"). Liu Yuanlin’s annotation to the *Weidu Fu* explains: \"叛换 is like 恣睢\" (\"arbitrary and unrestrained\"). Thus, \"上忘而下不叛\" means \"toward superiors, he forgets his loftiness; toward inferiors, he does not assert dominance.\" Hence, the following text states: \"He who with virtue defers to others has never failed to win them.\" Guo Xiang’s annotation to the *Zhuangzi*—\"high yet not overbearing\"—captures its essence.\n\nBo Jun’s note: The *Lüshi Chunqiu* *Guigong* chapter reads \"上志而下求\" (\"above, he is mindful; below, he seeks\").\n\nHe feels shame before those not equal to the Yellow Emperor and pities those not equal to himself.\n**Annotation:** Ashamed that his Dao does not match the sages, and compassionate toward those whose people fall short of his own, he thus discards no one.\n**Explanation:** Forgetting his own loftiness and ashamed of his lack of virtue, his resolve to embrace goodness runs deep. Toward those inferior to himself, he feels pity and compassion, so his subordinates do not rebel or disperse.\n\nWang Chongmin notes: The *Zhiyao* omits the character \"其\" after \"愧,\" which is correct. Neither the *Zhuangzi* *Xu Wugui* chapter nor the *Lüshi Chunqiu* *Guigong* chapter includes it, confirming this.\n\nOne who shares virtue with others is called a sage.\n**Annotation:** He transforms others to align with the Dao without imposing control.\n\nOne who shares wealth with others is called a worthy.\n**Annotation:** The more he gives, the more he possesses.\n\nTo govern others with worthiness never wins their allegiance.\n**Annotation:** Demanding perfection from others, things will not comply.\nWang Chongmin notes: The *Zhiyao* includes the character \"者\" after the first \"人,\" which is correct. This parallels the following sentence: \"以贤下人者未有不得人者也.\" Since the latter includes \"者,\" it is clear the former originally did as well. The *Zhuangzi* omits both \"者\" characters, a divergence between the *Zhuangzi* and *Liezi*. However, this may serve as indirect evidence that the first sentence should include \"者.\"\n\nHe who with worthiness defers to others has never failed to win them.\n**Annotation:** One who rises and falls with things will surely be embraced by them.\nWang Chongmin notes: The *Zhiyao* includes the characters \"之也\" after \"归\" in the annotation.\n\nIn governing the state, there are things he does not hear; in managing the household, there are things he does not see.\n**Annotation:** When the Dao prevails, there is no need for excessive hearing or seeing. Thus, it is said: \"One who is neither blind nor deaf cannot achieve success.\"\nWang Chongmin notes: The *Zhiyao* renders \"烦\" as \"赖\" in the annotation.\nBo Jun’s note: The *Lüshi Chunqiu* *Guigong* chapter includes the sentence \"其于物也有不知也\" after \"有不闻也.\"\n\n**Annotation by Guo Xiang:** If he were to hear and see everything, affairs would center on himself, leaving subordinates nowhere to place their hands and feet. Thus, disregarding such matters is acceptable. Since he cannot fully embody the Dao, merely this is permissible.\n**Explanation:** Not demanding the ordinary nature of things is \"not hearing in the state.\" Not seeking others’ minor faults is \"not seeing in the household.\"\nThe *Zhiyao* renders \"群下\" as \"群生\" in the annotation.\n\nThus, the *Shiwen* notes: \"仅 is pronounced *jin*.\"\n\nIn this case, Guan Yiwu’s slighting of Bao Shu was not intentional; he could not but slight him. His favoring of Xi Peng was not deliberate; he could not but favor him. Favor at the outset may turn to slight in the end; slight in the end may turn to favor at the outset. Tao Hongqing states: The phrase \"薄之于终，或厚之于始\" should read \"薄之于始，或厚之于终\" (\"slight at the outset may turn to favor in the end\"). The current version redundantly echoes the preceding two sentences. The ebb and flow of favor and slight do not depend on me.\n**Annotation:** All is the principle of Heaven.\n**Explanation:** Yiwu’s feelings held no inherent favor or slight; this was a public recommendation. Recommending someone was favor; not recommending was slight. All was a matter of effort. Since Duke Huan did not employ Bao Shu, it was Bao Shu’s fate. Employing Xi Peng was Xi Peng’s fate. Had Bao Shu lacked fate, Yiwu’s efforts would have been futile. Had Xi Peng lacked fate, Yiwu’s efforts, though exerted, would have been in vain.\n\nDeng Xi wielded the doctrine of dual possibilities.\n**Annotation by the *Shiwen*:** *Xi* is pronounced *xi*.\nDeng Xi authored two chapters. A native of Zheng, he was a contemporary of Zichan. Both the *Liezi* and Xunzi state that Zichan killed Deng Xi, but according to the *Zuozhuan*, Zichan died in the twentieth year of Duke Zhao, while in the ninth year of Duke Ding, Si Luan killed Deng Xi and adopted his bamboo penal code. Thus, he was not killed by Zichan.\n**Annotation:** *Cao* is pronounced *qi dao*.\nRen Dachun states: The account of Zichan killing Deng Xi appears in various philosophical works, not just Xunzi and Liezi. The *Lüshi Chunqiu* *Liwei* chapter records: \"When Zichan governed Zheng, Deng Xi devoted himself to challenging him. Those among the people with lawsuits would offer a robe for major cases or a jacket and scallions for minor ones. The number of people presenting robes, jackets, and scallions to learn litigation became innumerable. He inverted right and wrong, turning wrong into right and right into wrong.\"\n\nRight and wrong lacked measure, and what was permissible or impermissible shifted daily: what one wished to vindicate was vindicated, and what one wished to condemn was condemned. The state of Zheng fell into great disorder, and the people’s voices clamored in uproar. Zichan, troubled by this, thereupon executed Deng Xi and exposed his corpse, and the people were greatly subdued.\n\nThe *Huainanzi*’s *Quan yan xun* states: “Deng Xi was clever in disputation and subverted the law.” Gao You’s commentary notes: “Deng Xi taught the people of Zheng to litigate, and litigation brought no calamity. Zichan executed him for this.”\n\nYang Liang’s commentary on the *Xunzi*’s *Zheng lun* chapter cites the *Xin xu* as saying: “When Zichan judged cases, Deng Xi taught the people to challenge him. For major lawsuits, they pledged a robe; for minor ones, a jacket and scallions. The number of people presenting robes, jackets, and scallions to study litigation became innumerable. He inverted wrong into right and right into wrong. The state of Zheng fell into great disorder, and the people’s voices clamored in uproar. Zichan, troubled by this, thereupon punished Deng Xi and exposed his corpse, and the people were subdued; right and wrong were thus settled.” This account is of the same kind.\n\nThe claim that Deng Xi was not executed by Zichan first appears in Zhang Zhan’s commentary on the *Liezi*, under the phrase “soon after, he was executed.” Zhang Zhan’s note states: “The *Liezi* says Zichan executed Deng Xi, but the *Zuozhuan* records that Si Luan killed Deng Xi and adopted his bamboo penal code—Deng Xi died twenty years after Zichan’s death.” Jing Shun’s *Shiwen* further elaborates on this annotation, stating that Zichan died in the twentieth year of Duke Zhao, and Si Luan killed Deng Xi in the ninth year of Duke Ding—thus, Deng Xi’s death occurred twenty years after Zichan’s.\n\nYang Liang’s commentary on the *Xunzi*’s *Bu gou* chapter also notes: “The *Zuozhuan* states that Si Luan of Zheng killed Deng Xi and adopted his bamboo penal code, so the claim that Zichan executed him is likely an error.” This annotation, like Jing Shun’s *Shiwen*, is based on Zhang Zhan’s commentary.\n\nHe crafted endless arguments while Zichan held office and created the bamboo penal code.\n**Annotation:** *Bamboo penal code* refers to laws inscribed on bamboo slips.\nLu Wenchong remarks: The annotation “bamboo penal code, laws on bamboo slips” should perhaps read “bamboo-slip penal code.” Bo Jun notes: Lu’s suggestion does not clarify Zhang’s intent; Zhang’s annotation likely explains *bamboo penal code* as *laws on bamboo slips*.\n\nThe state of Zheng adopted it, repeatedly challenging Zichan’s governance.\n**Annotation:** *Shuo* is pronounced *shuo*. *Nan* is pronounced *nandan*.\n\nZichan was confounded by this. Zichan arrested and executed him, soon after putting him to death.\n**Annotation:** This tradition states that Zichan executed Deng Xi, but the *Zuozhuan* records that Si Luan killed Deng Xi and adopted his bamboo penal code—Deng Xi died twenty years after Zichan’s death.\nBo Jun notes: The phrase “Zichan arrested and executed him” contains a superfluous repetition of “Zichan,” likely interpolated from the preceding text. “Executed him” and “put him to death” are redundant. It is suspected that *lu* (executed) should instead read *ju* (arrested). The *Taiping Yulan* (626) omits the eight characters “was confounded by this. Zichan arrested and executed him,” having excised them due to their incomprehensibility, which further confirms the error’s long-standing nature.\n**Annotation:** *Lu* is pronounced *liu*, or written as [variant character]. *Luan* is pronounced *chuan*. *Zu* is pronounced *zilu*.\n\nThus, Zichan was not truly able to employ the bamboo penal code—he had no choice but to use it. Deng Xi was not truly able to humble Zichan—he had no choice but to submit. Zichan was not truly able to execute Deng Xi—he had no choice but to put him to death.\n\n**Annotation:** The principle of this passage aligns with that of the preceding one.\n\n**Explication:** To establish laws is a matter of power; to suffer execution is a matter of fate. To enforce those laws is also a matter of power; to put their author to death is also a matter of fate. To wield power in affairs is a matter of talent; for talent to go unrecognized is also a matter of fate. The Northern Song edition, Wang’s edition, and the Shidetang edition all omit the character *zhang* (\"passage\"); this follows the *Zang* edition’s addition.\n\nThose who may live and do live—some accumulate virtue and practice benevolence, some encounter favorable times and prosper, gaining the world’s favor and fulfilling their own aspirations, as if by retribution, as though through wisdom and effort. The Shidetang edition’s annotation omits the character *ye* (\"also\") at the end. This is Heaven’s blessing. Some are simply born, simply at peace—this is not necessarily due to benevolence, virtue, or wisdom. Yet to walk the path of trust and compliance, to fulfill one’s aspirations, to live out one’s years without care or peril—what but Heaven’s blessing could account for this?\n\n**Phonetic Annotation:** *Xing* (conduct) is pronounced *xia meng*.\n\nThose who may die and do die—some accumulate evil and commit violence, some suffer hunger, cold, and destitution, thus scorning punishment and execution, forsaking survival, and meeting their end in death, as if self-inflicted, as though responding to circumstance. The *Zang* edition’s annotation reads *yi* (\"with\") for *yu* (\"in\"), while the Shidetang edition reads *er* (\"and\"). This, too, is Heaven’s blessing. Some simply die, simply meet their end—this is not necessarily due to cruelty or folly. Yet to indulge a cruel heart, to dwell in a state where survival is untenable, and to meet one’s end in death—such a death is a fitting death, and thus it, too, is called Heaven’s blessing.\n\n**Explication:** To live when life is possible is Heaven’s blessing; to die when death is fitting is also Heaven’s blessing. For example, Yiwu sought life in the time of Duke Huan of Qi and secured his survival—this was truly Heaven’s blessing. Or consider Chu Ni, who dashed his head against a locust tree to meet his end, preserving his lord’s command and sparing a worthy man from harm, thus securing his death and an undying name—this, too, was Heaven’s blessing. The *Daozang Sijie* edition of the *Zang* reads *yi* (\"with\") for *yu* (\"in\") in the annotation “meeting their end in death.”\n\nThose who may live but do not—dwelling in prosperity and ease, wishing for long life yet meeting an early end. This is Heaven’s punishment. To wish for life yet not attain it is called Heaven’s punishment.\n\nThose who may die but do not—dwelling in hardship and humiliation, wishing not to live long yet enduring beyond death. The various editions omit the character *jiu* (\"long\") before *sheng* (\"life\"). This, too, is Heaven’s punishment. To scorn death yet not die is also Heaven’s punishment.\n\n**Explication:** Dwelling in prosperity and ease, occupying a lofty position—this is to be able to live yet not live, as with Dong Xian and the like. Dwelling in hardship and humiliation, enduring suffering and adversity—this is to be able to die yet not die, as with the human swine and the like. To seek yet not attain—both are Heaven’s punishment.\n\nThere are those who may live or die and do live or die. There are those who may neither live nor die, yet some die and some live. **Annotation:** This refers to those who, in this circumstance, live and do live, or die and do die. The two preceding lines have already encompassed this meaning, and their repetition here is suspect; likely a textual error. Tao Hongqing said: The two *bu* (\"not\") characters are superfluous; the original text read, “Those who may live or die, some die and some live.” This speaks of those who may live yet die, or may die yet live. Zhang’s annotation states: “This refers to those who, in this circumstance, live yet die, or die yet live.” This suggests that the edition he consulted lacked the two *bu* characters. The preceding passage states, “Those who may live yet do not live suffer Heaven’s punishment; those who may die yet do not die suffer Heaven’s punishment”—its meaning aligns with this, hence Zhang’s annotation also suspects repetition.\n\n**Phonetic Annotation:** *Chong* (repetition) is pronounced *zhu yong*.\n\nYet life and death, life and death—neither due to things nor to the self—are all a matter of fate. There is nothing wisdom can do.\n\n**Annotation:** Since the principle of life and death is unfathomable, death does not arise from things, nor does life reside in the self—how could wisdom avail?\n\n**Explication:** Not due to things, nor due to the self; when knowledge cannot prevail and effort cannot succeed, only then may one submit to fate. The Yuan edition and the Shidetang edition’s annotation read *bi* (\"must\") for *ru* (\"how\") at the end.\n\nThus it is said: Profound and boundless, the Dao of Heaven converges of itself; vast and undifferentiated, the Dao of Heaven moves of itself.\n\n**Annotation:** Boundless and undifferentiated—this is the ultimate of spontaneity. To converge and move of itself—how could it be compelled?\n\nJiang Yougao said: *Ji* (convergence) and *hui* (meeting) rhyme, both in the ancient *zhi* (*祭*) rhyme group. *Fen* (division) and *yun* (movement) rhyme, both in the ancient *wen* (*文*) rhyme group.\n\n**Phonetic Annotation:** *Fen* is pronounced *fu wen*; the annotation is the same.\n\nHeaven and Earth cannot transgress it.\n\n**Annotation:** Though Heaven and Earth are vast, they cannot defy spontaneity.\n\nThe sage and the wise cannot interfere with it.\n\n**Annotation:** Though the sagely and the divine are wondrous, they cannot contravene the workings of time.\n\nGhosts and demons cannot deceive it.\n\n**Annotation:** Though ghosts and demons are uncanny, they cannot falsify what is true and upright.\n\n**Phonetic Annotation:** *Mei* is written as *魅*; the annotation states: some write it as *媚*.\n\nThat which is spontaneous completes in silence.\n\n**Annotation:** *Mo* means \"without.\"\n\nLevels and pacifies.\n\n**Annotation:** To level and pacify requires no action.\n\nGuides and welcomes.\n\n**Annotation:** Without loss or ruin, it seems as though it guides and welcomes.\n\nIf one aligns with the Dao to fulfill destiny, Heaven and Earth cannot transgress it, the sagely and the wise cannot interfere with it; when operations accord with principle, responses to change are divine—even ghosts and demons cannot deceive it; how much less so human affairs?\n\n**Annotation by Bo Jun:** *Cheng*, *ping*, and *ning* rhyme, sharing the same ancient sound in the *geng* group; *jiang* and *ying* rhyme, sharing the same ancient sound in the *yang* group.\n**Phonetic Annotation:** *Sang* is pronounced *xi lang*.\n\nA friend of Yang Zhu was named Ji Liang.\nJi Liang fell ill, and after seven days, his condition grew critical.\n**Annotation:** *Jian* means \"severe.\"\n**Variant:** The Northern Song edition has *ji* (\"illness\") instead of *bing* (\"disease\").\n\nHis sons surrounded him, weeping, and begged for physicians.\n**Annotation by Wang Chongmin:** The *Taiping Yulan* (738) includes a *ye* (\"petition\") after *qing* (\"beg\"), meaning to request of their father that physicians be summoned. The following line, \"in the end, three physicians were petitioned,\" refers to this. Without *ye*, the meaning is unclear.\n**Annotation by Wang Shumin:** The *Wen Xuan* annotation to Sun Zijing’s letter to Shi Zhongrong also includes *ye*.\n\nJi Liang said to Yang Zhu: \"My sons are so unworthy—why do you not sing for me to enlighten them?\"\n**Phonetic Annotation:** *Wei* is pronounced *yu wei*.\n\nYang Zhu sang:\n\"Heaven does not recognize it—\nhow can man be aware?\nNot by blessing from Heaven,\nnor by misfortune from man.\nIs it I? Is it you?\nDo they not know?\"\n\n\"Physicians or shamans—\ndo they truly know?\"\n**Annotation:** This means only you and I understand that life and death are fated; physicians and shamans cannot know this.\n\nHis sons did not comprehend and ultimately petitioned three physicians.\n**Annotation:** They failed to grasp the meaning of Yang Zhu’s song, believing it aligned with their own views.\n**Exegesis:** If even the mandate of Heaven cannot be discerned, how can man perceive it? Heaven does not bestow blessings selectively, nor does man err to invite misfortune—yet one falls ill: this is fate. If even you and I cannot know this, how could physicians or shamans? Furthermore, the song’s intent suggests: if you and I can endure this illness, and I cannot, then perhaps the shaman can.\n\n**Qin Enfu’s note:** Lu’s exegesis under \"song’s intent\" contains omissions and errors.\n**Jiang Chaobo’s note:** *Zhong* means \"complete.\" The *Huainanzi*’s *Chuzhen Xun* states: \"Wisdom encompasses Heaven and Earth.\" *Zhong* means \"complete.\" Thus, \"ultimately petitioned three physicians\" means \"petitioned all three physicians,\" not \"in the end.\"\n\n**Phonetic Annotation:** *Jie* is pronounced *xie*.\nOne was surnamed Jiao.\n**Phonetic Annotation:** *Jiao* is pronounced *jiao* (rising tone).\nThe second was surnamed Yu, and the third was surnamed Lu. They examined his illness.\n**Phonetic Annotation:** *Zhen* is pronounced *zhen* (rising tone), meaning to feel the pulse.\n\nPhysician Jiao said to Ji Liang: \"Your cold and heat are imbalanced,\n**Phonetic Annotation:** *Ru* is written as *nü* (same pronunciation as *ru* below).\nyour deficiency and excess lack measure, and your illness stems from irregular eating, sexual indulgence, and scattered essence and thought. It is neither Heaven’s doing nor a ghost’s.\"\n\nThe Northern Song edition, Wang edition, and Qin edition write \"Heaven\" as \"premature death.\" While \"premature death\" may be borrowed for \"portent,\" though plausible, judging by the subsequent text—\"your illness stems neither from Heaven, nor from man, nor from ghosts\"—the version with \"Heaven\" is more appropriate. Thus, we follow the *Zang* edition and Yuan edition as correct.\n\n\"Though chronic, it may yet be treated.\"\n\nJi Liang said, \"A mediocre physician. Quickly dismiss him!\"\n\n**Phonetic Annotation:** *Ji* is pronounced *jí*. *Bing* is pronounced with a rising tone, meaning \"to remove.\"\n\nPhysician Yu said, \"At first, your prenatal *qi* was insufficient, while your postnatal milk was excessive.\n\n**Phonetic Annotation:** *Dòng* is pronounced *zhòng*, meaning \"milk.\"\n\nThe illness did not arise in a single day or night; its cause has accumulated gradually and cannot be cured.\"\n\nJi Liang said, \"A fine physician. Let him stay and be fed!\"\n\n**[Exegesis]:** The illness described by Physician Jiao stems from human failings, matters within one’s own power. The illness described by Physician Yu, however, arose with the body’s formation—*qi* was insufficient from the start and cannot be remedied.\n\n**Phonetic Annotation:** *Shí* is pronounced *sì*.\n\nPhysician Lu said, \"Your illness stems neither from Heaven, nor from man, nor from ghosts. Upon receiving your form, there was already one who governed it, and one who knew it.\n\n**[Annotation]:** The division of life and death, the span of long and short, are all determined by non-action, by the governance of Heavenly principle. Yet the ignorant are deluded by this, while those of profound insight comprehend it.\n\n**Phonetic Annotation:** *Fèn* is pronounced *fèn*.\n\nWhat can medicine and stone do for you?\"\n\nJi Liang said, \"A divine physician! Bestow generous gifts and send him off!\"\n\n**Phonetic Annotation:** *Kuàng* is pronounced *kuàng*.\n\nSoon after, Ji Liang’s illness resolved of its own accord.\n\n**[Exegesis]:** The illness described by Physician Lu arose from the spirit. The spirit’s workings may yield merit or fault. The form is the vessel that repays the spirit, and the spirit governs it. Before receiving form, the spirit already knew it. If the spirit is insufficient, the form follows accordingly. Longevity or brevity, beauty or ugliness—one’s physical endowment is already fixed. How could medicine or stone cure this? Ji Liang regarded him as a divine physician. By cultivating the spirit and nurturing virtue, his illness healed itself.\n\n**Phonetic Annotation:** *Chōu* is pronounced *chōu*.\n\nLife is not preserved by what is prized, nor is the body enriched by what is cherished. Life is not cut short by what is despised, nor is the body diminished by what is slighted. Thus, what is prized may not preserve life, and what is despised may not cause death; what is cherished may not enrich the body, and what is slighted may not diminish it. This appears contradictory, yet it is not—life and death, enrichment and diminution, proceed of their own accord. Or, what is prized may preserve life, and what is despised may cause death; what is cherished may enrich the body, and what is slighted may diminish it. This appears compliant, yet it is not—life and death, enrichment and diminution, likewise proceed of their own accord.\n\nYü Xiong addressed King Wen.\n\n**[Annotation]:** Yü Xiong was King Wen’s teacher.\n\n**Phonetic Annotation:** *Yü* is pronounced *yù*. *Yǔ* is pronounced *yù*, the same below.\n\nYü said: \"What is long is not lengthened by effort, and what is short is not shortened by harm. What then is lost by calculation?\"\n\n**[Annotation]:** *Suan* (算) here means \"wisdom\" or \"discernment.\"\n\n**[Interpretation]:** If one understands that the body’s recompense is as it is, then one will not be swayed by personal feelings. Personal feelings involve prizing and cherishing, despising and slighting. The body’s thickness or thinness does not follow the weight of such feelings—thus, what is gained may seem compliant, and what is attained may seem contradictory. Yet in truth, it is neither compliant nor contradictory, just as length and shortness, beauty and ugliness, are not altered by personal affection. They are beyond the reach of wisdom and calculation.\n\nQin Enfu notes: Lu’s interpretation of *baowei* (报为) may have an error in the character *wei* (为).\n\n**Phonetic Annotation:** *Suan* (算) is pronounced *xiàn*. *Wang* (亡) is pronounced *wú*.\n\nLaozi addressed Guan Yin, saying: \"Who knows the reason for what Heaven detests?\"\n\n**[Annotation]:** Wang Bi said: \"*Shu* (孰) means 'who.' Who can know the intent of Heaven? Only the sage.\"\n\nBo Jun notes: These two lines are from *Laozi*, Chapter 73. The present text of Wang Bi’s commentary reads: \"*Shu* means 'who.' Who can know the reason for what Heaven detests? Only the sage, perhaps!\" Zhang’s annotation quotes an abridged version.\n\n**Phonetic Annotation:** *E* (恶) is pronounced *wù*.\n\nTo anticipate Heaven’s will and weigh profit and harm is not as good as following one’s own nature.\n\n**[Annotation]:** One who follows the heavenly principle without contrivance cannot be violated by ghosts and spirits or disturbed by human affairs. But to anticipate Heaven’s will, calculate fortune and misfortune, embrace compliance to avoid opposition, and pursue profit while shunning harm—this merely sets one in great opposition to adversity and harm. It is the height of clever calculation, yet it cannot prevent the arising of good and ill fortune or the exhaustion of blessings and calamities.\n\n**[Interpretation]:** Those who do not know the Dao—how could they know what Heaven loves or hates? To preempt Heaven’s will, weigh profit and harm, and act from personal feeling is to fail to follow principle and entrust oneself to fate. This chapter speaks of the inability of human effort to alter fate, and the unknowability of fate in advance. To entrust oneself to it is to lag behind the times; to strive against it is to defy fate. Thus it rebukes those who know the Dao yet cultivate spirit, nurture authenticity, initiate undertakings, and strive to turn fate to their will, contending with Heaven.\n\nQin Enfu notes: Lu’s interpretation under \"knowing the Dao\" may have an omission.\n\n**Phonetic Annotation:** *Chuai* (揣) is pronounced *chuǎi*. *Liao* (料) is pronounced *liáo*.\n\nYang Bu—\n\n**[Annotation]:** Younger brother of Yang Zhu.\n\n—asked: \"Consider a man here: in age, he and his brother are alike; in speech, they are alike—Yu Yue said: The character *yan* (言) is meaningless and should follow the *Shiwen* in reading as *zī* (訾). The *Guanzi*’s *Jun Chen Shang* chapter states, 'Officials and stewards all have *zī cheng shi lü* (訾程事律),' which refers to this meaning of *zī*. Official ranks and social status must be measured by *zī cheng* (訾程). Thus, '*Zī* brothers' corresponds properly to the following 'nobility and baseness are like father and son.' Yin Jingshun did not grasp the meaning of *zī* and thought it should be the character for wealth, but then the following line should speak of poverty and wealth, not nobility and baseness.\"\n\n**Phonetic Annotation:** *Yan* (言) in the *Shiwen* is written as *zī* (訾), pronounced *jī yí*; it should be the character for wealth. Another version writes *yan* (言).\n\n—in talent, they are alike; in appearance, they are alike. Yet in longevity and early death, they are like father and son; in nobility and baseness, they are like father and son; in reputation, they are like father and son; in love and hatred, they are like father and son. I am perplexed by this.\"\n\n**[Interpretation]:** Age, speech, talent, and appearance are similar, so they are called brothers. Longevity and early death, nobility and baseness are vastly different, so they are called father and son. This is the unknowability of fate, hence the perplexity.\n\nYangzi said: \"The ancients had a saying I once learned and shall now tell you. What is so without reason for being so is fate.\n\n**[Annotation]:** It is the principle of spontaneity, thus it cannot be known by wisdom.\n\nNow, in darkness and obscurity, in confusion and disorder, one follows what is done and what is not done. Days pass and days come—who can know the reason? It is all fate.\"\n\n**Phonetic Annotation:** *Mei* (昧) is pronounced *huì*.\n\nLu Wenchang said: The *Zang* edition omits the character *neng* (能).\n\n**[Interpretation]:** What the multitude does not understand, they take as natural—dark and obscure, days passing and coming, ceaseless in their movement. Do people take this as fate?\n\nOne who trusts in fate is without longevity or early death.\n\n**[Annotation]:** Where there is longevity or early death, it is not fate.\n\n**Phonetic Annotation:** *Wang* (亡) is pronounced *wú*, the same below.\n\nOne who trusts in principle is without right or wrong.\n\n**[Annotation]:** Where there is right or wrong, it is not principle.\n\nOne who trusts in the heart is without compliance or opposition.\n\n**[Annotation]:** Where there is compliance or opposition, it is not the heart.\n\nOne who trusts in nature is without safety or danger.\n\n**[Annotation]:** Where there is safety or danger, it is not nature.\n\nThis is called having nothing to trust and nothing not to trust.\n\n**[Annotation]:** Principle, too, is without trust or lack of trust.\n\nThe *Daozang* Jiang Yu edition and the *Sijie* edition omit the second *du* (都).\n\nTruly sincere and earnest—what is there to abandon, what to pursue? What is there to grieve, what to rejoice?\"\n\n**Phonetic Annotation:** *Le* (乐) is pronounced *luò*.\n\nWhat is there to do, what not to do?\n\n**[Annotation]:** If principle is without heart, then there is nothing not done, and also nothing done.\n\n**[Exegesis]:** Longevity and premature death are of fate; right and wrong are of principle; compliance and opposition are of the heart; safety and danger are of nature. If one who trusts in fate is without longevity or premature death, one who trusts in principle is without right or wrong, one who trusts in the heart is without compliance or opposition, and one who trusts in nature is without safety or danger, then this is called having nothing to trust and nothing not to trust—only then does one reach the true Dao. What is there to abandon, what to pursue? What is there to grieve, what to rejoice? What is there to do, what not to do? This is called the ultimate Dao.\n\nThe *Yellow Emperor’s Book* states: *\"The perfected person dwells as though dead, moves as though mechanical.\"*\n\n**[Annotation]:** This illustrates the extreme of being without heart.\n\nYu Yue remarks: The character *xiè* (械) is meaningless. **Phonetic Annotation:** The text also appears as *jiè* (戒), but both are in fact the character *hài* (骇). In the *Rites of Zhou*, the Grand Charioteer’s \"commencement drum\" (*shǐ jiè gǔ* 始□戒鼓) is recorded in the old script as *hài* (骇). The original text of the *Liezi* likely also used *hài* (骇) for *jiè* (戒), but later copyists mistakenly wrote it with the wood radical as *xiè* (械). *\"Dwells as though dead, moves as though startled\"* (*jū ruò sǐ, dòng ruò hài*) conveys the same meaning as *\"like a virgin, like a fleeing hare.\"*\n\nWang Shumin states: Yu Yue’s interpretation is incorrect. The perfected person’s *\"heart is like dead ashes\"* (*xīn rú sǐ huī*), hence *\"dwells as though dead\"* (*jū ruò sǐ*); their *\"form is like withered wood\"* (*xíng rú gǎo mù*), hence *\"moves as though mechanical\"* (*dòng ruò xiè*). The annotation *\"this illustrates the extreme of being without heart\"* is correct. *Jiè* (戒) is also a loan for *xiè* (械). If taken as *hài* (骇), it misses the point.\n\nThe *Zhuangzi*’s *\"Gengsang Chu\"* chapter states: *\"Moves without knowing what is done\"*—this is the same meaning as *\"moves as though mechanical.\"* **Phonetic Annotation:** *Xie* (械) is pronounced *hù jiè*, and the text also appears as *jiè* (戒). They neither know why they dwell, nor why they do not dwell; neither know why they move, nor why they do not move.\n\nNeither do they alter their inner disposition or outward appearance because of the many people’s observations, nor do they claim that their inner disposition or outward appearance remain unchanged because the many do not observe them.\n**[Annotation]** They do not change their bearing due to external perceptions or judgments.\n\nTao Hongqing states: The phrase *\"nor do they claim that their inner disposition or outward appearance remain unchanged because the many do not observe them\"* should read *\"nor do they alter their inner disposition or outward appearance because of the many people’s observations\"*—the current *\"do not observe\"* is a spurious addition by later hands.\nZhang’s annotation suggests that the version he saw had both clauses as *\"because of the many people’s observations.\"*\nThe superfluous *\"not\"* distorts the meaning, rendering it repetitive.\n\nWang Chongmin notes: *\"For\"* (為) and *\"claim\"* (謂) were interchangeable in ancient usage.\nZhang’s annotation implies that the text he consulted read *\"for.\"*\n**[Phonetic Annotation]** *\"Claim\"* (謂) is written as *\"for\"* (為), pronounced *yú wěi*; the annotation follows the same reading.\n\nAlone they come, alone they go; alone they depart, alone they enter—who can obstruct them?\n**[Annotation]** Things go, and they go with them; things come, and they come with them.\nThey let things enter and exit freely, so nothing can obstruct them.\n\n**[Exegesis]** *\"Dwells as though dead\"*—without heart; *\"moves as though mechanical\"*—operates like a device.\nLike a wooden puppet’s movements, what awareness could there be?\nIt lies neither in disposition nor in appearance—merely a wandering spirit.

The same applies to the pronunciations *\"yú lüè,\"* *\"chǐ lüè,\"* and *\"kǔ jiāo\"* below.\n\nQin Enfu states: This passage seems to lack Lu’s annotation.\n*Fangyan* states: *\"Biē\"* means *\"evil.\"*\nGuo Pu’s annotation: *\"Biē fū\"*—a hasty temperament.\nThe *Hou Hanshu*’s *\"Dong Zhuo\"* chapter: *\"bì cháng gǒu tài\"* (敝肠狗态).\nLi Xian’s annotation: *\"Bì\"* is written as *\"biē\"*—*Fangyan* glosses it as *\"evil.\"*\n*Fū* should be written as *fū* (怤).\n**[Phonetic Annotation]** *Biē* is pronounced *piàn miè*; *fū* is pronounced *fū*.\n*Fangyan* states: *\"Biē fū\"* is pronounced *fú*, meaning *\"hasty temperament.\"*\n\nFour individuals wander together in the world, each following their own inclinations.\n**[Phonetic Annotation]** *Xū* (胥) is pronounced *xiāng jū*—meaning *\"mutual.\"*\n*Rú* (如) means *\"to follow.\"*\nThat is, each follows their own will.\n\nThough they live out their years without understanding one another’s true feelings, they each believe their own wisdom to be profound.\n**[Exegesis]** Though they wander together in the world, they never learn one another’s names throughout their lives, each considering themselves superior.\n\nCrafty flattery and foolish honesty—\n**[Exegesis]** *\"Crafty flattery\"*—the appearance of glib and obsequious speech.\n*\"Foolish honesty\"*—the appearance of guileless simplicity.\n**[Phonetic Annotation]** *\"Crafty flattery\"*—clever words and perverse compliance.\n*\"Foolish honesty\"*—like a fool, honest and straightforward.\n\n*Nüè* (婩) **[Annotation]** is pronounced *yú lüè*.\n*Zhuó* (斫) **[Annotation]** is pronounced *chǐ lüè*.\n*\"Nüè zhuó\"*—the appearance of unenlightened obstinacy.\n**[Exegesis]** The demeanor of dull astonishment.\n\n**[Note]** The seven characters *\"Nüè zhuó—the appearance of unenlightened obstinacy\"* appear in the *Northern Song* edition and Wang’s edition under the phrase *\"pián pì\"* (便辟).

The heart’s qi connects to the tongue, the spleen’s qi to the mouth, and the spleen’s vessels link to the tongue’s root. When pathogenic qi invades the organs and contends with the normal qi, speech is initiated and qi is stirred, allowing the pathogen to disrupt the proper vessels. Obstructed qi causes congestion, leading to stuttering—this is treatable.\" *Yiqie Jing Yinyi*, citing *Tongsu Wen*, states: \"Impeded speech is called *jiǎn chí* (謇吃).\"\n**[Phonetic Annotation]** *Jiǎn* (□) is pronounced *jiǎn*, *jí* (□) is pronounced *jí*.\n*Zilin* states: *Jí* (□) means stuttering. *Fangyan*: *Jí* (□), *chī* (吃), and *jí* (□) mean urgency—speech is hurried and stuttered. It also denotes a halting manner. It further means rapidity, or a hasty temperament at odds with others. Some write it as *jí* (殛) or *jí* (极), but these are incorrect.\nRen Dachun states: In *Xunzi’s \"Rhapsodies\"*, \"entering and exiting with great *jí* (极)\" is glossed: \"*Jí* (极) is read as *jí* (亟), meaning urgency.\" It also states: \"reversing and repeating with great *jí* (极),\" with the gloss: \"*Jí* (极) is read as *jí* (亟), meaning urgency.\" Thus, *jí* (□) is also interchangeable with *jí* (极).\n\n**Harsh rebukes** **[Annotation]** pronounced *suì*.\nThese all describe the manner of excessive reproach, stammering, inarticulacy, or glibness.\n**[Exegesis]** The appearance of seizing opportunities to censure others.\nThe *Shide Tang* edition reads \"此皆多\" as \"比皆反\".\n**[Phonetic Annotation]** *Suì* (谇) is pronounced in the *rù* tone.\n*Harsh rebukes* means a fondness for humiliating and berating others.\n*Shuowen* states: *Suì* (谇) means to reproach and admonish.\n*Zilin* glosses it as *jù lǜ* (聚律) cut.\n*Nè* (讷) is pronounced *nú hū*.\n*Sè* (涩) is pronounced *suǒ lì*.\n\nThe four wander together in the world, each following their own inclinations.\nThough they live out their years without mutual enlightenment,\n**[Note by Bo Jun]** The Qin edition includes an \"而\" after \"穷年\".\neach believes their own talent to be perfectly realized.\n**[Exegesis]** Each considers their own abilities superior.\n\n**Dullness** **[Annotation]** pronounced *mò diǎn*.\n**Slackness** **[Annotation]** pronounced *tú jiǎn*.\n**[Exegesis]** The appearance of lacking vitality.\n**[Phonetic Annotation]** *Mián* (眠) is written as 「」, pronounced in the *shǎng* tone.\n*Niǎn* (娗) is pronounced *tiǎn*.\n*Fangyan*: *Niǎn* (娗) means deceptive and contemptuous speech. Guo Pu states: It refers to using words to belittle and mock others. It also denotes an unforthcoming manner.\nRen Dachun states: The modern edition writes 「」 as *mián* (眠). *Fangyan* reads *mián niǎn* (眠娗) as *mò diǎn*, and the modern edition’s *mián* (眠) is correct. Jing Shun’s *Shiwen* edition writes *mián* (眠) as 「」. Consulting *Yupian*, this is an ancient form of the character *shì* (视). 「」 is pronounced *shàng zhī*, meaning \"to see\"—its meaning differs entirely from *mián* (眠) in *mián niǎn* (眠娗). The character 「」 should be *mián* (眠); Tang scholars avoided the character *mín* (民), hence the substitution with *shì* (氏). The *Shiwen*’s note \"眠上声\" is a superfluous *mián* (眠).\n\n**Hesitation** **[Annotation]** pronounced *zhǐ lěi*.\n**Shirking** **[Annotation]** pronounced *rú wěi*.\n**[Exegesis]** Both describe a cumbersome, encumbered manner.\nThe *fǎn* (反) in the four phonetic annotations—*mò diǎn* (莫典), *tú jiǎn* (徒茧), *zhǐ lěi* (止累), and *rú wěi* (如伪)—are added following the Yuan edition and *Shide Tang* edition.\n**[Phonetic Annotation]** *Zhuì* (諈) is pronounced *zhī shuì*.\n*Wěi* (诿) is pronounced *kǒu huì*, or *rú wěi*.\nIt means sluggishness.\n*Erya* states: *Zhuì wěi* (諈诿) means to shift burdens away. Guo Pu states: It refers to passing responsibilities to others through hesitation and shirking. It also means cumbersome and encumbered.\n\n**Courage and boldness**,\n**[Exegesis]** The appearance of vigor and strength.\n**[Phonetic Annotation]** Courage and boldness mean bravery, ferocity, and decisiveness.\n\n**Timidity and hesitation** **[Annotation]** *Mián niǎn* (眠娗) denotes an unforthcoming manner. *Zhuì wěi* (諈诿) denotes a cumbersome manner.\n**[Exegesis]** The appearance of weakness and indecision.\n**[Phonetic Annotation]** Timidity and hesitation mean cautious hesitation.\n\nThe four wander together in the world, each following their own inclinations.\nThough they live out their years without mutual reproach or exposure,\n**[Phonetic Annotation]** *Zhé* (谪) is pronounced *zhī gé*.\n*Zhé* (谪) means to censure their faults; *fā* (发) means to attack their flaws.\neach believes their conduct to be free of transgression.\n**[Exegesis]** Each considers their own path perfectly balanced and appropriate.\n**[Phonetic Annotation]** *Xíng* (行) is pronounced *xià mèng*.\n*Wú lì* (无戾) means without deviation or offense.\n\n**Harmonious**,\n**[Exegesis]** The appearance of agreement and accord.\n**[Phonetic Annotation]** *Duō ǒu* (多偶) means frequent harmony with others.\n*Guangya* states: *Ǒu* (偶) means harmony.\n\n**Self-reliant**,\n**[Exegesis]** The appearance of acting alone.\n**[Phonetic Annotation]** *Zì zhuān* (自专) means to act independently without consulting others.\n\n**Seizing power**,\n**[Exegesis]** The appearance of wielding authority.\n**[Note by Bo Jun]** The Qin edition writes *chéng* (乘) as *bǐng* (秉).\n**[Phonetic Annotation]** *Chéng quán* (乘权) means to leverage power and influence.\n\n**Standing alone**,\n**[Exegesis]** The appearance of solitary integrity.\n\nThe *Shiwen* states: *Zhī lì* (只立) means solitary and self-reliant.\n\nFour people wander together in the world, each following their own aspirations; though they spend their whole lives without glancing at one another, each deems their own timing fitting. These are the manifold dispositions of the world. The *Shiwen* states: *Tài* (态) is pronounced *tā ài*.\n\nTheir appearances are not uniform—*qí* (其) was originally absent but has been added following the Jifu and Shidetang editions—and yet all are subsumed under the Dao, as destiny’s return. **[Exegesis]** That cunning, eloquence, foolishness, flattery, and integrity—these manifold dispositions—are all ascribed to destiny is a principle that cannot be so. Now, those who expound such views claim that the thickness or thinness of one’s received *qi* accounts for these differences, attributing all to Heaven without recourse—this is the ignorance of the unknowing.\n\nThus, those who know the Dao cultivate their spirit, preserve their authenticity, ease their concerns, and transform their bodies. Their physical forms are self-fashioned; they exert their conduct, shift their destinies—these are the splendid achievements of those who nurture life. Yet if one distinguishes destiny by form, then effort is inferior to destiny; if one verifies form by effort, then destiny is inferior to effort.\n\n*Guǐ guǐ chéng zhě* (佹佹成者) are those who *qiào* (俏) succeed. **[Annotation]** *Qiào* is pronounced *xiào*. *Qiào* means \"to resemble.\" Qin Enfu notes: Lu’s annotation reads *wēi wēi* (魏魏), differing from Zhang Zhan’s edition. Bo Jun observes: A *zhě* (者) may be missing after *qiào chéng* (俏成) to match the syntax below. The *Liushu Gu* (Six Writings) Volume 8 cites it correctly as *qiào chéng zhě yě* (俏成者也). The *Shiwen* states: *Guǐ* (佹) is pronounced *gū wēi*, denoting a near-desiring appearance. *Qiào* is identical to *xiào* (肖). Yet this is not true success. **[Exegesis]** *Wēi wēi* (魏魏) describes a near-desiring state. *Qiào* means \"to resemble.\" *Guǐ guǐ bài zhě* (佹佹败者) are those who *qiào* (俏) fail—yet this is not true failure.\n\n**[Annotation]** The world speaks of near-gains and near-losses, but in truth, there is no \"near.\" **[Exegesis]** One who nearly succeeds yet does not is like success but not success; one who nearly fails yet does not is like failure but not failure. The *Shiwen* states: *Jī* (几) is pronounced *qí*, the same below.\n\nThus, delusion arises from *qiào* (俏). **[Annotation]** Confusion stems from mistaking semblance for success or failure, unable to discern the source of delusion. Lu Wenchang notes: The annotation’s *yǐ* (以) appears as *sì* (似) in the Zang edition. At the juncture of *qiào* (俏), all is obscure. The *Shiwen* marks this as a sentence. If one is not obscure at the juncture of *qiào* (俏), **[Annotation]** *Jì* (际) means \"convergence,\" implying murky indistinction. **[Exegesis]** Human delusion arises from resemblance, from lack of clarity. Without clarity, all is obscure. If one discerns resemblance without obscurity, this is called illumination. Lu Wenchang notes: The Zang edition includes an *ér* (而) after *mèi* (昧) in the annotation.\n\nThen one is not startled by external misfortune—the *Shiwen* writes *hài* (骇) as *hài* (駴), stating it is identical to *hài* (骇)—nor delighted by inner fortune. **[Annotation]** Are misfortune and fortune truly internal or external? Both are the mysterious determinations of principle. Seeing their sudden emergence, one calls them external; seeing their gradual manifestation, one calls them internal. The *Shiwen* states: *Zú* (卒) is pronounced *cūn* (村) in the entering tone. One moves with the times, halts with the times—wisdom cannot fathom it. **[Annotation]** If movement and stillness are not of the self, then they are not discernible by wisdom. **[Exegesis]** The so-called illuminated one understands nature, comprehends the spirit, and knows that effort gives rise to life while destiny brings it to fruition. Thus, there is no external misfortune to fear, no inner fortune to rejoice in; movement and stillness follow the times, requiring no calculation by wisdom.\n\nThose who trust in destiny harbor no duality between self and other. **[Annotation]** They have no emotions of joy or fear. Those who harbor duality between self and other would do better to cover their eyes, plug their ears, turn their backs to slopes, and face moats without stumbling. **[Annotation]** This illustrates that relying on wisdom and planning is inferior to following nature. **[Exegesis]** If one can eliminate duality between self and other, then fortune and misfortune, regret and shame do not arise. If one cannot know destiny and follow principle, then preserving the body and avoiding harm is merely to escape collapse and stumbling.\n\nThus, the world does not forget striving for effort but cannot entrust itself to destiny. Lu Wenchang notes: The annotation’s *rú* (如) appears as *ruò* (若) in the Zang edition. The *Shiwen* writes *bèi bǎn* (背阪) as *bèi chéng* (背城) and *zhuì* (坠) as *duì* (队), stating: *Yǎn* (揜) is pronounced *yǎn*; *bèi chéng* (背城) appears as *bèi bǎn* (背阪) in one edition. *Duì* (队) is pronounced *zhuì* (坠), *pū* (仆) as *fù* (赴).\n\nThus it is said: Life and death follow destiny; poverty and hardship follow the times. **[Annotation]** If it were not for destiny, the benevolent and wise would surely live long, while the cruel and foolish would surely die young—but this is not necessarily so. **[Annotation]** If it were not for the times, the diligent and frugal would surely grow rich, while the extravagant and indolent would surely remain poor—but this is not necessarily so. **[Exegesis]** Zixia said: \"Life and death are a matter of destiny; wealth and honor rest with Heaven.\" \"Heaven\" here means \"the times.\" When yang warmth spreads its *qi*, all things are born; when the sage benefits from this and all beings flourish, this is called destiny, self-determined; when transformation reaches them, this is called the times. Lu Wenchang notes: The Zang edition includes a *yě* (也) at the end of the annotation. Tao Hongqing states: *Pín qióng* (贫穷) should be *pín fù* (贫富), aligning with the preceding \"life and death follow destiny.\" Zhang’s annotation suggests his edition originally read *pín fù* (贫富). The current text’s error stems from the following \"those who resent poverty.\" The *Shiwen* states: *Pín qióng zì shí yě* (贫穷自时也) appears as *fù guì zì shí yě* (富贵自时也) in one edition.\n\nThose who resent early death do not understand destiny; those who resent poverty do not understand the times. The *Shiwen* states: *Shé* (折) is pronounced *zhī shé*. **[Annotation]** These are all failures to recognize the principles of nature. Facing death without fear, enduring hardship without sorrow—this is knowing destiny and resting in the times. **[Exegesis]** Knowing destiny and resting in the times is the greatest virtue.\n\nWhen the times come, they cannot be shared; when destiny arrives, it cannot be refused. Thus it is said: rest in the times and dwell in compliance, and sorrow and joy cannot enter. Delusion arises from resemblance, and grief arises from not understanding the times.\n\nThose who are highly intelligent weigh advantages and harms, assess emptiness and fullness—*liào* (料) is pronounced *liáo*. They gauge human sentiments—*duó* (度) is pronounced *tuò luò*, as below. Whether they gain or lose, they hit the mark—*zhòng* (中) is pronounced *zhì chōng*, meaning \"half,\" as below. Some editions read *zhì zhòng*, which is incorrect.\n\n**[Annotation]** *Zhòng* means \"half.\"\n\nThose of little intelligence do not weigh advantages and harms, do not assess emptiness and fullness, do not gauge human sentiments. Whether they gain or lose, they still hit the mark. What difference is there between weighing and not weighing, assessing and not assessing, gauging and not gauging?\n\n**[Exegesis]** Generally, in assessing the affairs of the world, one who succeeds half the time must be skilled in assessment. Yet those of little intelligence, though they do not assess, also succeed half the time—what difference is there? Only when there is nothing measured—**[Annotation]** not employing intelligence—and nothing unmeasured—**[Annotation]** relying on what intelligence knows—is one whole and without loss—*wáng* (亡) is pronounced *wú*; *sàng* (丧) is pronounced *xī làng*, as below. Yet this is neither knowing wholeness—*zhī* (知) is pronounced *zhì*, as below in \"knowing loss\"—nor knowing loss. One is whole of oneself, lost of oneself, ruined of oneself.\n\n**[Annotation]** Being whole of oneself is not something the mind’s efforts can achieve; being ruined of oneself is not the result of misconduct.\n\n**[Exegesis]** Even if one toils the mind and strains the will, assessing with half success, it is still inferior to not assessing at all and preserving one’s life. Those who labor in thought do not understand destiny; those who measure nothing do not rely on their own strength. Not relying on strength is close to the Dao, so one abandons the former and adopts the latter.\n\nYu Yue says: The three characters \"自亡也\" (*zì wáng yě*) are likely superfluous. The preceding text states: \"Only when there is nothing measured and nothing unmeasured is one whole and without loss. This is neither knowing wholeness nor knowing loss.\" Here, it says, \"One is whole of oneself, ruined of oneself,\" which is sufficient in meaning. Adding \"lost of oneself\" disrupts the parallel with the earlier \"whole\" and \"loss.\" This redundancy likely arose from the three preceding instances of *wáng* (亡), all meaning \"nothing\" (無), not \"loss\" (丧亡).—*xíng* (行) is pronounced *xià mèng*.\n\nDuke Jing of Qi traveled to Ox Mountain. Ox Mountain is now in Linzi County of Beihai Prefecture. Looking north over his capital, he wept and said: \"How beautiful is this land! So lush and verdant—*qiān* (芊) is pronounced *qiān*. The *Guang Ya* states: *qiānqiān* means \"luxuriant.\" Why must I leave this land, flowing away in tears?\"—Lu Wenchang says: In the *Zang* edition, \"滴滴\" appears as \"□□.\"—*Dīdī* (滴滴) is also written as *pāngpāng*, both pronounced *pǔ láng*, meaning \"flowing abundantly.\" Ren Dachun says: For *pāngpāng*, it suffices to note the pronunciation *pǔ láng*; there is no need to say \"both pronounced.\" This means the main text’s *dī* and the variant *pāng* are both pronounced *pǔ láng*. However, *dī* has no such pronunciation. Consulting the *Xunzi*’s \"Fu Guo\" chapter, Yang Liang’s annotation reads: \"*Fāngfāng* (汸汸) is read as *pāng*, meaning 'abundant water.'\" Thus, *dī* may be a corruption of *fāng*.\n\nBo Jun notes: The *Liezi*’s *Shiwen* convention is that if character A should be character B, or if they share the same meaning, then B’s pronunciation is given, regardless of whether the two characters can be phonetically loaned. Below, it states: *xíng* (行) is glossed as *xiá* (暇), meaning *xíng* should be *hé* (何), not that *xíng* has the sound of *hé*. The same applies to *dī* and *pāng* sharing a pronunciation.\n\nRen’s argument is unclear.\n\n\"If the ancients never died, where would I go from here?\"—Lu Wenchang says: The *Han Shi Waizhuan* reads \"何之\" (*hé zhī*) instead of \"之何\" (*zhī hé*).\n\nShi, Kong, and Liangqiu Ju all wept alongside him—*Shǐ Kǒng* (史孔) is written as *Ài Kǒng* (艾孔) in one edition; *ài* is pronounced *wǔ gài*. They said: \"We rely on Your Lordship’s grace. Coarse grain and tough meat are ours to eat—*sū* (疏) is written as *guì* (跪) in one edition; *guì* should be *sū*. The *Han Shi Waizhuan* includes this entire passage, stating: 'Coarse grain and tough meat can be eaten.' Coarse grain means vegetables. We may ride broken-down horses and rickety carts—*nú* (驽) appears as *nù* (怒) in the *Shide Tang* edition. *Zhàn* (棱) should be *zhàn* (栈). The *Yanzi Chunqiu* and other texts all write *zhàn chē* (栈车), meaning carts made of woven wood. *Zhàn* is pronounced *shì xiàn*. Even so, we do not wish to die—how much less should our lord?\" Only Yanzi laughed to the side—*Yànzǐ* (晏子) is written as *Yàn Yīng* (晏婴); Yan Ying was from Yiwei in Lai.\n\nThe duke wiped his tears and turned to Yanzi—Bo Jun notes: The *Lüshi Chunqiu*’s \"Guan Biao\" chapter states: \"Wu Qi wiped his tears in response.\" Gao You’s annotation: \"*Xuě* (雪) means 'to wipe.'\" The *Kongzi Jiayu*’s \"Zilu Chujian\" chapter states: \"Millet is used to wipe the mortar.\" The annotation: \"*Xuě* means 'to wipe.'\"—and said: \"Today’s outing has saddened me. Kong and Ju wept with me, yet you alone laugh. Why?\"\n\nYanzi replied: \"If worthy men always preserved it, then the Grand Duke and Duke Huan would still possess it...\"\n\n\"If brave men always preserved it, then Duke Zhuang and Duke Ling would still possess it. Bo Jun notes: 'And always preserve it' means 'could always preserve it.' *Néng* (能) and *ér* (而) share an ancient pronunciation, hence they may be used interchangeably. If these several lords were to preserve it, our lord would now be donning a straw raincoat and bamboo hat, standing amidst the furrows of the fields. Would he have leisure to grieve over affairs or contemplate death in vain?\n\n[Annotation] *Xíng jiǎ* (行假) should read *hé xiá* (何暇).\n[Exegesis] That the dead may return to life is a notion common to Buddhist scriptures, Daoist texts, and Confucian teachings, though none state it plainly. Here, however, it is said that 'our lord would now be donning a straw raincoat and bamboo hat, standing amidst the furrows of the fields'—thus the principle of life and death is made clear. We know that power brings about destiny, and destiny brings forth life; hence the workings of life’s renewal are evident. Wang Chongmin notes: The *Han Shi Waizhuan* reads *hé xiá* (何暇). The *Shiwen* glosses: *Xíng jiǎ* is pronounced *hé xiá*. Then how could our lord have attained this position and stand here? Because it is by turns occupied and relinquished. As for the lord alone weeping over it—this is unkind. Seeing an unkind lord and flattering ministers, I saw these two things, and this is why I alone secretly laughed.\"\n\nBo Jun notes: *Wéi* (为) means *yǐ* (以). \"The reason for laughing alone\" means \"the reason why I alone laughed.\" For further discussion, see Wang’s *Shici*.\n\nDuke Jing felt ashamed, raised his cup, and punished himself. He then penalized the two ministers, each with two cups. There was a man of Wei named Dongmen Wu whose son died, yet he did not grieve. Wang Shumin notes: The *Taiping Yulan* (518), *Jizuan Yuanhai* (48, 51), *Shiwen Leiju* (Later Collection 7), and *Hebi Shilei* (Former Collection 32) all include \"aged forty\" after \"there was a man.\" The phrase \"his son died, yet he did not grieve\" is rendered as \"he had a son whom he lost, yet he did not grieve.\"\n\nHis steward said: Bo Jun notes: The *Liji*’s \"Qu Li\" (Part II) states: \"A scholar does not refer to his steward or eldest concubine by name.\" *Xiàngshì* (相室) likely means *jiāxiàng* (家相), the one who assists in household affairs. The *Shiwen* glosses: *Xiàng* is pronounced *sì liàng*. \"Your lordship’s love for your son was unmatched in the world. Now that your son has died, why do you not grieve?\" Dongmen Wu replied: \"I once had no son. When I had no son, I did not grieve. Now that my son has died, it is the same as when I had no son before. Why should I grieve?\" Wang Chongmin notes: The *Jifu* edition reads *jù* (讵) instead of *chén* (臣), likely the original read *xī jù yōu yān* (奚巨忧焉). *Xī jù* is a compound, but readers, not grasping its meaning, altered it to place the emphasis on *xī* (奚). Bo Jun notes: The *Taiping Yulan* (518) reads: \"Then why should I grieve?\"\n\nThe farmer hurries to the season, the merchant hastens for profit, the artisan pursues his craft, and the official chases power—such is the force of circumstance. Yet the farmer faces drought and flood, the merchant meets gain and loss, the artisan encounters success and failure, and the official meets favor or rejection—such is the force of destiny.\n\n[Annotation] The workings of nature’s hidden course.\n[Exegesis] That scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants each pursue profit and chase power is what their strength can achieve. Drought and flood, success and failure, favor and rejection—these lie beyond their power, so they entrust themselves to destiny and find peace. This is like gathering the mulberry and elm without harming their protection. The world attributes what cannot be helped to destiny, yet those who do not strive are deluded by the semblance of attainment. Dongmen Wu was skilled at accepting destiny, not at understanding it. If the living have one who gives life, then one grasps that which creates one’s destiny; how then could one entrust destiny to the living? This is to grasp the principle of alternating presence and absence. One who understands destiny should entrust it to fate while applying one’s strength.\n\nQin Enfu notes: Lu’s annotation on the \"mulberry and elm\" sentence is unclear. Sun Yirang notes: The exegesis likely reads *sāng* (桑) for *sōu* (橾) and *yǔn huò* (陨获) for *sǔn hù* (损护), as seen in the *Liji*’s \"Ruxing\" chapter. Bo Jun notes: Based on Lu’s exegesis, it seems the *Chongxuan* edition connects \"the farmer hurries to the season\" to the preceding passage. However, judging by the meaning, \"the farmer hurries to the season\" and what follows form a separate section, summarizing the chapter’s theme, and thus remains set apart.\n\n[Annotation] Life is but a momentary gathering of qi, a fleeting spark of sentience in a single being. What is momentarily gathered must ultimately scatter; what is fleetingly sentient must return to emptiness. Yet to favor ease and detest labor is the constant nature of all things. Thus, what delights one in life amounts to nothing more than rich flavors, fine garments, beautiful forms, and enchanting sounds. Yet one cannot freely follow the inclinations of one’s nature or the pleasures of the senses, instead using benevolence and righteousness as bolts and ritual propriety as sashes, withering away in one’s prime while seeking a lingering reputation in posterity—this is to fail to grasp the joy of the ceaseless arising of life.\n\n[Exegesis] The noble person dies for fame, the petty person for profit. Fame and profit alike are what emotions drown in and the common crowd contends for. Thus, one who embodies the Dao does good without nearing fame, does not rush toward what the crowd competes for; does evil without nearing punishment, does not act in ways the crowd condemns. To violate the Dao in pursuit of fame or to drown in emotion in pursuit of desire is equally to lose the mean. Therefore, one who possesses the Dao does not dwell in such extremes. This passage seems contradictory, and scholars have often doubted it. Yet how does the chapter of Yang Zhu differ from that of Robber Zhi?\n\nThe *Shiwen* notes: Yang Zhu, some say his courtesy name was Ziju, was a man of the Warring States period, later than Mozi. Yang Zhu debated with Qin Guli, advocating self-love and refusing to pluck a single hair for the benefit of the world, opposing Mozi’s teachings. Lu Deming states, “Yang Rong’s courtesy name was Ziju,” suggesting Ziju was not Yang Zhu.\n\n*Hao* is pronounced *hūbào*; *wù* as *wūlù*; *fù* as *fúyòu*; *jiàn* sounds like *jiàn*; *jīn* as *jīn*; *gǎo* as *kǒulǎo*.\n\nLiang Yusheng remarks: In the *Zhuangzi*’s “Emperor of the North Sea,” Yang Ziju appears, and the *Shiwen* notes, “Li [Yi] says: *Ju* is his given name; *zi* is a general term for men.” Elsewhere, in the *Zhuangzi*’s “Words for All Occasions,” the *Shiwen* states, “His surname was Yang, given name Zhu, courtesy name Ziju,” where he engages in dialogue with Laozi. How then could he be identified as Yang Zhu?\n\nYang Jun notes: Whether Yang Zhu and Yang Ziju were the same person has long been debated. Wang Zhong, in his *Shuxue Laozi Kaoyi* appendix, argued they were two distinct figures, and later scholars like Tang Yue, in his *Yang Zhu Kao* (published in *Dongfang Zazhi*, vol. 22, no. 5), insisted Yang Zhu was not Yang Ziju. The view that they were two people is likely correct.\n\nYang Zhu traveled to Lu and lodged with the Meng family. Meng asked him, “One is merely human—why the need for fame?” Yang Zhu replied, “Fame is for wealth.” “Once wealthy, why not stop?” “For honor.” “Once honored, why not stop?” “For death.” “Once dead, what then?” “For descendants.”\n\n[Annotation] Since one’s affairs never cease, one’s desires are never sated.\n\nThe *Shiwen* notes: *Wéi fù*, *wéi guì*, *wéi sǐ*, *xī wéi yān*, and *wéi zǐsūn* are all pronounced with the *wěi* tone. *Yàn* is pronounced *yīyán*.\n\n“What benefit does fame bring to one’s descendants?” Yang Zhu replied, “Fame torments the body and scorches the heart.\n\n[Annotation] Fame is to seek the real through the false, to summon the substantial through the insubstantial, to act against one’s nature and force one’s conduct—how could it not entail the toil of anxiety?\n\nThe *Shiwen* notes: *Jiāo* is pronounced *jiāo*.\n\nYet those who ride upon fame bring blessings to their clans and benefits to their villages—how much more so to their descendants?”\n\nTao Hongqing said: “The eight characters ‘Fame torments the body and scorches the heart’ should follow the passage above, ‘Master Meng asked: \"Man is but man—why seek fame?\"’—to reveal the harm of fame and the folly of those who pursue it. Furthermore, the lines ‘Once wealthy, why not cease? Once noble, why not cease?’ precisely describe those who, despite tormenting body and scorching heart, do not desist. Now, mistakenly omitted here, the preceding passage lacks full meaning, while this passage, discussing the benefits of fame, first presents its harms, disrupting the coherence of the argument.”\n\n“Those who pursue fame must be incorruptible; incorruptibility leads to poverty. Those who pursue fame must be yielding; yielding leads to lowliness.”\n\n[Annotation] This is the objection of a disputant. Now, those who possess the fame of incorruptibility and yielding yet cannot escape poverty and lowliness do so because they practice goodness without seeking profit.\n\n[Explication] In this worldly life, man is concerned only with fame and profit. The sage uses fame and profit as a hook: petty men die for profit, gentlemen die for fame—none fail to be ensnared. Though good and evil differ, both involve seeking. Yet those who seek fame and succeed not only attain wealth and nobility but bring glory to their descendants and benefit their villages. Though they torment the body, scorch the heart, and labor in incorruptibility and yielding, their aspirations have an object, and their passions forget themselves—both lose the mean.\n\nThe *Shiwen* notes: *Nàn* is pronounced *nǎidàn*.\n\nYang Zhu said: “When Guan Zhong served as minister to Qi,\n\nThe *Shiwen* notes: *Xiàng* is pronounced *xīliàng*; same below.\n\nthe lord was licentious, and so was he; the lord was extravagant, and so was he.”\n\n[Annotation] This means he did not claim sole credit for good or evil.\n\nBo Jun notes: The *Analects* (*Eight Rows of Dancers*) states: “Guan Zhong had three concubines, did not combine official duties, erected screen gates like a feudal lord, and set up a *fandian* for diplomatic banquets like a feudal lord.” All these are evidence of his licentiousness and extravagance.\n\n“Their aspirations aligned, their words followed one another, and their Dao was enacted, making the state hegemonic. Yet after death, Guan Zhong was nothing more.”\n\n[Explication] The benefit of true fame is meager.\n\n“When the Tian clan served as ministers to Qi,\n\nBo Jun notes: The *Imperial Digest* (vol. 485) includes the words ‘thereafter’ before ‘the Tian clan.’\n\nthe lord was full, and they diminished themselves; the lord levied, and they bestowed.”\n\n[Annotation] This shifts blame onto the lord.\n\nThe *Shiwen* notes: *Liǎn* means to gather and collect; *shī* is pronounced *shǐchǐ*.\n\n“The people all turned to them, and thus they took possession of Qi. Their descendants have enjoyed it to this day, unbroken.”\n\n[Explication] The benefit of false fame runs deep.\n\n“If true fame leads to poverty, false fame brings wealth.”\n\n[Annotation] To do good without seeking fame, yet fame arises naturally—this is true fame. To pursue fame in order to gain profit while the world remains unaware—this is false fame. False fame is what secures profit.\n\nThe annotation “fame arises naturally” reads in the *Zang* edition as “yet arises naturally.”\n\nYu Yue remarks: After “If true fame leads to poverty, false fame brings wealth,” two sentences should follow: “true fame leads to lowliness, false fame brings nobility.” The preceding text states, “All who seek fame must be incorruptible, and incorruptibility leads to poverty; all who seek fame must be yielding, and yielding leads to lowliness.” Thus, the examples of Guan Zhong and the Tian clan are cited to prove that true fame results in poverty and lowliness, while false fame yields wealth and nobility.\n\nTao Hongqing states: Yu’s suggestion that two sentences—“true fame leads to lowliness, false fame brings nobility”—should be added is correct. However, his claim that this and the preceding discussion of Guan Zhong and the Tian clan form a single argument is mistaken. The earlier passage reads, “All who seek fame must be incorruptible, and incorruptibility leads to poverty; all who seek fame must be yielding, and yielding leads to lowliness.” Zhang’s annotation rightly treats this as the objection of a disputant. Here, the statement “If true fame leads to poverty, false fame brings wealth; true fame leads to lowliness, false fame brings nobility” likewise represents the objection of a disputant. *Ruo* (“if”) here means “in this manner”; for further discussion, see Wang’s *Jingzhuan Shici* (“*Ruo* may be followed by *ran* [‘thus’]; the phrase ‘Meng Sunyang said, *ruoran* [if thus], swift death is preferable to prolonged life’ in the *Shuofu* and ‘*Ruoran*, why could the dead not speak of the art of living?’ in the *Shuo Fu* provide examples”).\n\nThe claim that Guan Zhong’s descendants were poor and lowly due to their true fame, while the descendants of the Tian clan were wealthy and noble due to their false fame, would imply that fame indeed leads to poverty and lowliness. The disputant’s intent here is that \"true\" refers to genuine fame, while \"false\" refers to something other than fame. The subsequent response states, “Truth has no fame, fame has no truth; fame is but falsity.” This means that truth and fame cannot coexist—once something is called fame, it is all falsity with no truth, which would imply that fame indeed leads to wealth and nobility. The respondent’s intent is that \"false\" constitutes fame, while \"true\" is not fame. The following response explicitly marks its beginning with *yue* (“it is said”) to distinguish it, leaving no doubt that this is the disputant’s objection. If one were to attribute this and the preceding and following passages to a single speaker, then the lines “Truth has no fame, fame has no truth” and so on would become redundant and superfluous, their purpose unclear.\n\nFrom “Now that they are wealthy, why not pursue it?” onward, all belong to the disputant’s objections, where the *yue* (“it is said”) is omitted. Readers must discern the meaning for themselves.\n\nIt is said: “Truth has no fame, fame has no truth. Fame is but falsity.”\n[Annotation] Without falsity, one cannot attract profit.\n[Exegesis] Those with true conduct have no fame; those who seek fame have no truth. Thus, without falsity, profit cannot be made manifest.\n\nFormerly—Emending note: The *Taiping Yulan* (424) and *Yiwen Leiju* (21) omit the character *zhe* (“one who”)—Yao and Shun falsely offered the world to Xu You and Shan Juan, yet did not lose the world, enjoying a reign of a hundred years.\n[Annotation] The traces of truth and falsity arise from circumstances. Those who achieve falsity follow the traces of Yao and Shun, but the sage is without falsity.\nEmending note: Yao’s offer of the world to Xu You is also recorded in the *Zhuangzi*’s “Free and Easy Wandering” chapter; Shun’s offer of the world to Shan Juan is likewise found in the *Zhuangzi*’s “Giving Away a Throne” and “Robber Zhi” chapters.\n\nBoyi and Shuqi truly ceded the rulership of Guzhu—Emending note: The *Taiping Yulan* (424) and *Yiwen Leiju* (21) omit the character *jun* (“lord”), which is correct—and ultimately lost their state, starving to death on Mount Shouyang.\n\nThe distinction between truth and falsity is thus made clear.\n\n[Annotation] *Shěng* means \"to examine.\"\n\n[Exegesis] The false pursues reputation without substance; the true embodies action while forgetting fame. The contrast between Yao and Shun on the one hand, and Boyi and Shuqi on the other, is thus luminously clear. Are the traces of truth and falsity not easily discerned? If worldly people do not lose their authenticity in pursuit of fame and profit, they will drown in passions and desires, forgetting the Dao.\n\nThe good are few in the world, while the unvirtuous are many; thus, those who chase reputation are rare, while those who follow desire are legion. Even the wise can do nothing about this, for all have lost the mean.\n\nThe *Shiwen* notes: *Shěng* is read *sī jǐng qiē*.\n\nYang Zhu said: \"A hundred years is the utmost limit of longevity.\" The *Shiwen* notes: *Qí* is read in the falling tone, meaning \"limit.\" Among a thousand, not one attains a hundred years. The *Shiwen* reads *wú* as *wáng*, glossing it: \"pronounced *wú*.\" Even if one such person exists, from infancy to senility, nearly half their years are spent thus. The *Shiwen* notes: *Jǐ* is pronounced *qí*; same below.\n\nOf the remaining half, sleep at night erases some, and waking hours squander others. The *Shiwen* notes: *Mǐ* is read *mián bì qiē*; *jué* is pronounced *jiào*. Pain, illness, sorrow, and suffering—loss, anxiety, and fear—consume yet another half. Lu Wenchang notes: The *Yilin* quotes \"pain and illness\" as \"illness and disease.\" Wang Shumin notes: The *Wen Xuan*’s commentary on Lu Ji’s \"Long Song\" also reads \"illness and disease.\"\n\nMeasuring within these ten-odd years, how rarely does one find a moment of carefree contentment, free from the slightest concern? The *Shiwen* notes: *Wáng* is pronounced *wú*; same below. *Jiè* is pronounced *jiè*, meaning \"subtle.\" Such moments last but an instant. What, then, is the purpose of human life? What joy does it bring? The *Shiwen* notes: *Lè* is pronounced *luò*.\n\nIt is for fine food and rich pleasures— The *Shiwen* notes: *Wéi* is read *yú wěi qiē*—for sensual delights. Yet even these cannot be constantly sated; The *Shiwen* notes: *Fù* is read *fú yòu qiē*; same below. *Yàn* in the *Shide Tang* edition is written as *yàn*, the original character. The *Shiwen* notes: *Yàn* is read *yī yán qiē*; some versions write *yàn* as *餍*, with the same pronunciation. Nor can sensual pleasures be perpetually indulged.\n\nThus, one is further constrained by rewards and punishments, advanced or withdrawn by fame and law. Restlessly, one competes for fleeting reputation in the moment, scheming for posthumous glory.\n\nEver anxious, one conforms to the sights and sounds that please the eyes and ears—*\"Shùn\"* in the *Daozang* *Baiwen* edition, *Lin Xiyi* edition, *Yuan* edition, and *Shide Tang* edition all write it as *\"shèn\"* (cautious). The *Yilin* citation matches this. *Qin Enfu* notes: The ancient characters *\"shùn\"* (顺) and *\"shèn\"* (慎) were interchangeable. In the *Yi Jing*, *\"Treading on frost, solid ice follows—this speaks of shùn,\"* where *\"shùn\"* means *\"shèn.\"* The *Shiwen* writes *\"shùn\"* as *\"shèn,\"* noting: *\"Yǔ\"* is pronounced *qiū yǔ qiè.* *\"Shèn ěr\"* in one version is written as *\"shùn ěr.\"* *Ren Dachun* observes: In the *Xunzi*’s *\"Cultivating the Self\"* chapter, *\"shùn Mò\"* is glossed by *Yang Liang* as *\"shèn Mò.\"* In the *\"Junzi\"* chapter: *\"The loyal are sincere—this is what shèn refers to.\"* *Yang Liang*’s commentary reads: *\"Shèn* is read as *shùn.*\" The *Shiwen* for the *Zhuangzi*’s *\"Lie Yukou\"* chapter notes: *\"Shèn in warfare\"*—*\"shèn\"* is sometimes written as *\"shùn.\"* *\"Those who are shùn-huān and yet succeed\"*—*\"shùn\"* is also written as *\"shèn.\"* In the *Da Dai Liji*’s *\"Baofu\"* chapter: *\"Because of what they were shèn toward others,\"* *Lu Bian*’s commentary states: *\"All win the people’s hearts\"*—here, *\"shèn\"* means *\"shùn.\"* In the *\"Zengzi on Great Filial Piety\"* chapter: *\"After parents have passed, one shèn-conducts oneself\"*—*\"shèn\"* is also written as *\"shùn.\"* In the *\"Shèn Virtue\"* chapter: *\"To shèn Heaven’s laws,\"* the commentary reads: *\"The Dao of Heaven cannot be accomplished by merely shùn-ing it\"*—thus, *\"shèn\"* means *\"shùn.\"* In the *\"Wenwang’s Officials\"* chapter: *\"Without discernment, one naturally shèn\"*—*\"shèn\"* is read as *\"shùn.\"* *\"Shùn ěr\"* here preserves the ancient character.\n\nOne clings to the right and wrong of personal inclinations, merely forfeiting the supreme joy of one’s prime years, unable to indulge freely even for a moment.\n\nThe heavy prisoner, bound in layered fetters—*Shiwen* notes: *\"léi\"* is pronounced *léi*. *\"Gù\"* is read as *gǔ* in the *gǔwò* initial, meaning hand restraints. What difference is there? The annotation states: *\"yì\"* means \"different,\" an ancient character. The explanation: Ordinary people all take a hundred years as the span of a lifetime, yet what is diminished by day and night of sorrow and toil is already so much; those who remain at ease and follow their nature are few in number. Matters of following one’s nature extend no further than indulging in sound, form, fine flavors, yet again constrained by the bonds of punishment and reward, fame and teaching, unable to give free rein to their nature—how do they differ from those imprisoned in shackles and fetters? These are all words of stagnant emotion.\n\n*Shiwen* notes: The ancient character for *\"yì.\"*\n\nThe people of the Great Antiquity—*Shiwen* notes: *\"Tài\"* is written as *\"dà\"* and pronounced *tài*—knew that life is but a brief sojourn, knew that death is but a fleeting departure. The annotation: In truth, life is a brief sojourn, death a long departure—this is the commonplace talk of the world. Yet to say death is but a fleeting departure, at first glance, seems a scribal error. However, the central purport of this text holds that existence and annihilation, departure and return, the transformation and continuation of form and *qi*, have never truly ceased. This meaning is already expounded in detail in the annotation to the *\"Heavenly Auspices\"* chapter. The Qin engraving of Lu’s commentary omits the character *\"zhī\"* (\"know\") before *\"sǐ\"* (\"death\"). *Shiwen* notes: *\"Zú\"* is read as *cù* in the *qīhū* initial. Thus, they acted from the heart, following their impulses without resisting what nature favored. *Shiwen* notes: *\"Cóng\"* is pronounced *zòng*, and so below. *\"Hào\"* is read as *hào* in the *hūbào* initial.\n\nThe pleasures of this life are not to be forsaken—Yu Yue notes: *\"Dāng shēn\"* (\"this life\") is an error for *\"dāng shēng\"* (\"present life\"). Below, it states, *\"The reputation after death is not to be sought,\"* and *\"dāng shēng\"* directly opposes *\"sǐ hòu\"* (\"after death\"). Further on, it says, *\"Moreover, hasten to the present life—why rush to consider the afterlife?\"*—this serves as proof. *Shiwen* notes: *\"Qù\"* is pronounced *qiū lǚ*. Thus, one is not swayed by the lure of reputation. The annotation reads: *\"Those who do good without drawing near to fame.\"*\n\nThe Northern Song edition, Wang’s edition, and the *Four Explications* edition write *\"guān\"* (\"observe\") for *\"quàn\"* (\"exhort\"), but here we follow the Jifu edition, the *Daoist Canon* unannotated edition, and the Shidetang edition in correcting it. *Shiwen* notes: *\"Quàn\"* has a variant reading as *\"guān.\"*\n\nFollowing one’s nature in wandering, one does not oppose the desires of the myriad things. The reputation after death is not to be sought, so one does not incur punishment. The annotation reads: *\"Those who do evil without drawing near to punishment.\"* Bo Jun notes: Not opposing the desires of the myriad things means not offending others; not offending others means not doing evil, hence one does not incur punishment. Zhang’s annotation touches on this but does not elaborate. *Shiwen* notes: *\"Jìn\"* is read in the falling tone, and so below. *\"Xíng\"* means harm.\n\nFame and reputation, whether early or late, and the length of one’s lifespan are not matters to be measured. The exegesis states: To cite the people of the great antiquity is to suit the mean. That which is born and dies is form; that which emerges into life and enters death is spirit. Knowing that life and death are but fleeting arrivals and departures, one does not urgently seek fame; knowing that spirit is neither born nor dies, one does not anxiously strive for the Dao. Thus, one acts from the heart without resisting what nature favors. One delights in the body alone—what use is there for fame? Thus, one wanders in accord with one’s nature without opposing the desires of the myriad things. One is content in the moment alone—what fear is there of punishment? Therefore, fame, reputation, and lifespan are not matters to be calculated.\n\nThose who delight in the body and are content in the moment move in harmony with the Dao, not drowning in emotion. Yang Zhu said: \"What differs among the myriad things is life; what is the same is death. In life, there are the worthy and the foolish, the noble and the base—this is what differs. In death, there is putrefaction and dissolution—this is what is the same. Though this be so, worthiness and foolishness, nobility and baseness are not within one’s power; putrefaction and dissolution are also not within one’s power. Thus, life is not what one lives, death is not what one dies; worthiness is not what one makes worthy, foolishness is not what one makes foolish, nobility is not what one makes noble, baseness is not what one makes base.\" The annotation reads: All these are natural, not what one’s power can effect.\n\nBo Jun notes: After *\"gù shēng fēi suǒ shēng\"* (\"thus, life is not what one lives\"), the character *\"néng\"* (\"power\") is likely omitted below each *\"suǒ\"* (\"what\"). These phrases closely follow *\"xián yú guì jiàn fēi suǒ néng yě, chòu fǔ xiāo miè yì fēi suǒ néng yě\"* (\"worthiness and foolishness, nobility and baseness are not within one’s power; putrefaction and dissolution are also not within one’s power\"). A careful reading of Zhang’s annotation and Lu’s exegesis below suggests that the editions they consulted all included *\"néng.\"*\n\nYet the myriad things are equal in life and equal in death, equal in worthiness and equal in foolishness, equal in nobility and equal in baseness. The annotation reads: All return equally to nature. Whether ten years or a hundred years, all die. The benevolent and sagely die, the cruel and foolish die. In life, they may be Yao and Shun; in death, they are but rotting bones. In life, they may be Jie and Zhou; in death, they are but rotting bones. The bones rot the same—who knows the difference? Moreover, hasten to the present life—why rush to consider the afterlife? The annotation reads: This mocks those who calculate the afterlife in their delusion.\n\nOne who does not scheme for the past, does not worry for the future, and has no attachment to the present—this is the perfection of virtue. The exegesis states: Life is the retribution of this body; death is the exhaustion of this retribution. Worthiness and foolishness, nobility and baseness are the distinctions of living things—hence they differ. Putrefaction and dissolution are the constants of dead things—hence they are the same. The world points to form as life and death, unaware of the spirit beyond form. When the spirit departs, it is as if all knowledge ceases. Thus, worthiness and foolishness, nobility and baseness, putrefaction and dissolution are not what form itself can effect. If not self-effected, then the substance of all living things has never not been equal. People know what is equal but not why they differ. Moreover, they compete in the present life and have no leisure to nurture what gives them life—thus those who possess the Dao do not conform to this.\n\nYang Zhu said: \"Bo Yi did not lack desire—his error lay in his pride in purity, leading him to starve to death.\" The annotation reads: He clung to starvation until death. *Shiwen* notes: The *Gongyang Commentary* states: *\"Fàng sǐ bù lì\"* (\"He starved to death without establishing himself\"). Liu Zhao’s annotation reads: *\"Fàng\"* means \"to the utmost.\" Zhan Ji did not lack emotion—his error lay in his pride in integrity, leading him to diminish his lineage. *Shiwen* notes: *\"Guǎ zōng\"* means \"few in lineage.\" How mistaken is this error of purity and integrity! The annotation reads: These are words that slander the worthy and betray reality, yet to convey praise or blame, one cannot but place responsibility on those of lofty virtue.\n\nThe exegesis states: The excess of pursuing fame truly reaches this point—this is not how one embodies the truth, perfects the Dao, forgets fame, and attains reality. Yang Zhu said: \"Yuan Xian was impoverished in Lu.\" Bo Jun notes: *\"Jù\"* should be *\"jù.\"* The *Shuowen*, *Yupian*, *Guangyun*, *Jiyun*, and *Yunhui* all write *\"jù,\"* not *\"jǔ.\"* The *Leipian* writes *\"jǔ.\"* The *Jiyun* also includes *\"jǔ,\"* glossing it as *\"ōu jù.\"* It is suspected that those writing *\"jǔ\"* were all later scholars from the Tang onward, for before the Tang, there was no character *\"jǔ.\"*\n\nThe *Poetry*’s \"Bei Men\" states, \"Ever impoverished and poor,\" while the *Erya* glosses *jù* as \"poverty.\" The *Classic of Rites* reads, \"The host declines with *jù*,\" and the *Xunzi*’s \"Questions of Yao\" says, \"Thus they are petty and *jù*.\" All instances of *jù* should be written as *jù*.\n\nThe *Exegesis on Texts* notes: *Jù* is pronounced *qíyǔ*. Zigong engaged in commerce in Wei.\n\nThe annotation explains: *Jù* means poverty; *zhí* refers to mercantile pursuits. Yuan Xian’s poverty harmed his life, while Zigong’s commerce burdened his person.\n\nThe *Exegesis on Texts* adds: *Lèi* is read in the departing tone.\n\n\"Then neither poverty nor commerce is acceptable—where, then, does the acceptable lie?\"\n\nThe *Exegesis on Texts* notes: *Yān* is pronounced *yúqián*.\n\nThe reply: \"The acceptable lies in delighting in life, the acceptable lies in easing the body. Thus, one who delights in life is not impoverished—\"\n\nThe annotation explains: \"He suffices in what sustains him and does not fall into want.\"\n\n\"—and one who eases the body does not engage in commerce.\"\n\nThe annotation explains: \"He does not labor his mind to amass wealth.\"\n\nThe exegesis states: Clinging to poverty without striving harms life; pursuing commerce for sustenance burdens the body. Only the man of the Dao neither chases wealth to ease his body nor clings to poverty to afflict his life. Delighting in the Dao and preserving reality, he responds to things without obstruction.\n\nYang Zhu said: \"An ancient saying goes: *'In life, we cherish one another; in death, we abandon one another.'*\"\n\nBo Jun notes: *Juān* in ancient pronunciation belonged to the *wen* rhyme group, while *lián* belonged to the *zhen* group. Their rhyming in antiquity was most proximate; here, *juān* and *lián* form a rhyme.\n\nThe *Exegesis on Texts* writes *juān* as *sǔn*, glossing it: pronounced *juān*.\n\n\"This saying is perfect. The way of cherishing one another is not merely about sentiment: diligence can bring ease, hunger can bring satiety, cold can bring warmth, and poverty can bring success. The way of abandonment is not that one feels no sorrow: one does not hold pearls and jades in the mouth—\"\n\nThe *Exegesis on Texts* notes: *hán* is pronounced *hàn*.\n\n\"—does not dress in brocade, does not display sacrificial animals, does not arrange funerary objects.\"\n\nThe exegesis states: Knowing that the ways of cherishing and abandonment are perfect, yet none can attain them—why? Cherishing lies in providing for life, abandonment in freeing the form from burdens; this is the height of propriety. If in life one cannot ensure another’s peace but in death merely buries jewels to flaunt fame, inviting bandits to inflict further harm, one has lost all sense of what is fitting.\n\nYan Pingzhong asked Guan Yifu about nurturing life. Guan Yifu replied: \"Let it flow freely—do not dam or obstruct it.\"\n\nThe *Exegesis on Texts* notes: *Yōng* is pronounced *yǒng*; *è* is pronounced *āngě*, identical to *è*.\n\nYan Pingzhong asked: \"What does this entail in practice?\"\n\nYifu said: \"Indulge the ears in what they wish to hear, the eyes in what they wish to see, the nose in what it desires to smell, the mouth in what it wishes to say, the body in what it desires for comfort, and the will in what it wishes to pursue.\"\n\nThe annotation explains: Guan Zhong’s fame resounded in his time; as minister to Qi, he achieved hegemony through power and strategy. The way of effortless action was hardly fitting for him, nor did circumstances permit such words. Moreover, in the previous chapter, he urged Duke Huan to visit the northern lands at life’s end—this is likely all allegory.\n\nThe *Exegesis on Texts* notes: *Xiàng* is pronounced *xīliàng*; *fù* is pronounced *fúyòu*.\n\nThe ear desires to hear sounds, yet if denied, this is called *obstructing hearing*; the eye desires to see beauty, yet if denied, this is called *obstructing sight*; the nose desires to turn toward pepper and orchid, yet if denied scent, this is called *obstructing breath*. The annotation explains: The nose’s passage is called *breath*. *Breath* is pronounced *shūyán*. The *Exegesis on Texts* notes: *Scent* is pronounced *xìu*. *Breath* is identical to the character *膻*, pronounced *xūyán*.\n\nThe mouth desires to speak of right and wrong, yet if denied speech, this is called *obstructing wisdom*; the body desires comfort in luxury, yet if denied, this is called *obstructing ease*; the will desires to act wantonly, yet if denied, this is called *obstructing nature*. In the original text and the *Shide Hall* edition, *nature* is written as *going*, which is incorrect.\n\nAll these obstructions are the ways of tyrannical rulers. The annotation explains: *Tyrannical* means excessive. The *Exegesis on Texts* notes: *Tyrannical* means ruinous and cruel. To cast off tyrannical rulers, the *Exegesis on Texts* notes: *Cast off* is pronounced *qù*. live freely and await death, the *Exegesis on Texts* notes: *Freely* is pronounced *xī*, meaning to indulge one’s desires. For a day, a month, a year, or ten years—this is what I call nurturing. The annotation explains: To follow one’s nature to its fullest, exhausting joy and pleasure, though the time may be brief, is to fully realize the happiness of this life.\n\nTo be bound by tyrannical rulers, the *Exegesis on Texts* notes: *Bound* is pronounced *jū*. restrained and not released, Song Xiangfeng notes: *Restrained* carries the sense of prohibition. The *Xiao Erya* states: “To prohibit is to restrain.” Bo Jun observes: In the *Xunzi*’s “Cultivating the Self,” it says, “To be constrained by duties yet not restrained.” Yang Liang’s commentary explains, “Restrained means to be bound,” which is the meaning here. The *Exegesis on Texts* notes: *Released* is pronounced *shě*. living in sorrow until a long life, for a hundred years, a thousand years, or ten thousand years—this is not what I call nurturing. The annotation explains: To cherish reputation and be bound by ritual, inwardly harboring self-importance, fear, worry, and suffering until death, is to value long life and distant years—this is not what I esteem.\n\nThe commentary states: Yifu’s talent was sufficient to assist a hegemonic lord and revive decaying order, yet his indulgence in extravagance and excess was enough to offend future generations and corrupt customs. Thus, when the Master praised his talent, he said, “Were it not for Guan Zhong, we would still be wearing our hair loose and folding our robes to the left.” Yet when he condemned his lack of ritual, he said, “Guan Zhong’s vessel was small indeed! If even Guan Zhong knew ritual, who would not know it?” Liezi used a man of great talent to push his desires to the extreme, so that those on the Dao might recognize his errors.\n\nYet to indulge the senses and exhaust the desires of sound and beauty is the common inclination of worldly people. Thus, he pushed it to the limit and exposed it to reveal its evil—not as a teaching to guide future generations or a model for posterity.\n\nGuan Yiwu asked, “I have already told you of nurturing life—what of sending off the dead?” Yan Pingzhong replied, “Sending off the dead is a trivial matter—what is there to say?” Guan Yiwu said, “I still wish to hear of it.” Pingzhong said, “Once dead, how does it concern me? Burn the body—it is acceptable. Sink it in water—it is acceptable. Bury it in earth—it is acceptable. Leave it exposed—it is acceptable. Clothe it in firewood and cast it into a ravine—it is acceptable. Array it in embroidered robes and place it in a stone outer coffin—it is acceptable. Let it be as circumstances allow.”\n\n[Annotation] Yan Ying was a Mohist. He governed himself with frugality and moderation, moving always in accord with standards and measures, yet he did not grasp the distinction between life and death. Thus, these two worthies are cited to illustrate the proper cultivation of the person, taking only their divergence in extravagance and frugality.\n\n[Exegesis] Worldly people cling deeply to the pursuit of desire but treat the rites of sending off the dead with thin regard. Thin regard makes restraint easy, while deep attachment makes sentiment difficult to govern. Thus, to enrich life is what the multitude delights in; to treat death lightly is what the common heart readily follows. Liezi, then, used the extravagant to give free rein to passion and the frugal to restrain ritual. Hence, the likes of Wangsun were reproved by good officials for losing the middle Way.\n\nGuan Yiwu turned to Bao Shu Huangzi and said, “As for the Way of life and death, we two have advanced in it.”\n\n“”\n\n[Annotation] When one possesses awareness, one’s control is not dictated by external things; when one lacks awareness, it is not what I have heard of.\n\n[Exegesis] Since it is no longer governed by me, one should let things take their course—this is what worldly people mean when they say death is a state of unawareness. If it were governed by me, one would indulge passion to seek joy—this is what worldly people mean when they say following desire is noble. If this were so, Yao, Shun, the Duke of Zhou, and Confucius would not be esteemed by common folk, while Jie, Zhou, and Robber Zhi could serve as teachers for later generations. How could this be the conduct of those who embody the Dao? The perfected person forgets passion; the sage regulates it with ritual. When passion is forgotten, cravings no longer exist—how then could one be ensnared by sounds and sights? When ritual is established, the traces of life and death become manifest—how then could one treat cremation and exposure lightly? Indulging passion in such ways is to lose the Dao.\n\nThe *Shiwen* notes: *Jin* (advance) is pronounced *jin*.\n\nWhen Zichan served as minister of Zheng, the *Shiwen* notes: Zichan was Gongsun Qiao, a grandee of Zheng. He cast penal laws onto tripods, an event recorded in the sixth year of Duke Zhao. *Xiang* (minister) is pronounced *siang*. He monopolized the governance of the state. After three years, the virtuous submitted to his transformation, while the wicked feared his prohibitions, and Zheng was well governed. The *Shiwen* notes: *Zhi* (govern) is pronounced *zhi*; the same applies to *zhi* in \"well governed\" below. The feudal lords stood in awe of him.\n\nHe had an elder brother named Gongsun Chao, the *Shiwen* notes: *Chao* follows the given name. And a younger brother named Gongsun Mu. Chao was fond of wine, the *Shiwen* notes: *Hao* (fond) is pronounced *haow*. Mu was fond of women. Chao’s residence stored a thousand *zhong* of wine—this follows the *Sijie*, *Jifu*, and other editions; the Northern Song edition reads \"钟,\" followed by Wang’s edition and the *Shide Tang* edition. The *Shucao* (148), *Leiyuan* (497, 846), *Shilei Fu* (17), *Jizuan Yuanhai* (90), and *Tianzhong Ji* (29) all cite it as *zhong*. Fermented grains piled into mounds, the *Shiwen* notes: Another version reads *qu* (grain). The *Shiwen* reads *wang* (reach), pronounced *wang*. The stench of lees and dregs assailed the nose for a hundred paces beyond the gate. Chen notes: The *Guangya*’s *Shigu* states, \"Wang means to reach.\" The *Daozang* unannotated edition and Lin Xiyi’s edition both read \"醴\" (sweet wine) instead of \"糟\" (lees), but \"糟\" is the superior reading here. The *Shiwen* reads \"醴浆\" (sweet wine), noting: *Li* is pronounced *zao*; another version reads *zao* (lees).\n\nWhen he was lost in drink, he knew nothing of the state’s safety or peril, of human affairs’ regrets or resentments, the *lin* (regrets) in the Northern Song edition is written as \"\", followed by Wang’s edition and the *Zang* and *Qin* editions; this follows the *Shide Tang* edition. Of his household’s gains or losses, the *Shiwen* notes: *Wang* (loss) is pronounced *wu*. Of the closeness or distance of his nine clans, or the sorrow and joy of life and death. The *Shiwen* notes: *Le* (joy) is pronounced *luo*. Even if water, fire, or blades assailed him, he remained unaware.\n\nMu’s rear chambers adjoined dozens of rooms, the *Shiwen* notes: *Bi* (adjoin) is pronounced *bi*. All were filled with young, graceful women, the *Shiwen* notes: *Wo* is pronounced *woguo*. *Nu* is pronounced *nuo*. When he was immersed in sensuality, the *dan* (immersed) in the Northern Song, *Jifu*, and *Shide Tang* editions is written as \"聃\"; the same applies to \"耽于嗜欲\" below. The *Shiwen* notes: *Dan* is another version of \"\", pronounced *dinnan*. Ren Dachun states: The *Yupian* and *Leipian* lack the character \"\", but include \"\", a variant of \"\", meaning joy. The \"\" in the *Shiwen*’s \"another version reads \"\" is a corruption of \"\". He cast aside close kin, the *Shiwen* notes: *Bing* (cast aside) is pronounced in the upper tone. *Ni* (close) is pronounced *nizhi*. Severed friendships, and fled to the rear chambers to indulge day and night. The *Shiwen* notes: *Zu* (indulge) is pronounced *jizhu*, meaning to add. Chen notes: The *Guangyun*’s *Yu* rhyme states, \"*Zu* means to augment,\" thus it should be read in the departing tone. He emerged only once every three months, yet still felt unsatisfied. The *Shiwen* notes: *Qie* (satisfied) is pronounced *koudie*. If there were a maiden of surpassing beauty in the village, the *Shiwen* notes: *E* (beauty) is pronounced *e*. *Jiao* (loveliness) is pronounced *jiao*; the *Guangya* states it means \"fine.\" He would bribe and summon her, the *Shiwen* notes: *Hui* (bribe) is pronounced *huiwei*. Employ matchmakers to entice her. The *Shiwen* notes: *Tiao* (entice) is pronounced *tiaoyao*. The *Cangjie Pian* states: *Tiao* means to beckon. The *Shuowen* writes it as *tiao* (誂), meaning to lure. *Tiao* is pronounced *dialiao*. He would not cease until he obtained her. Chen notes: The character \"弗\" (not) may be superfluous or a corruption of \"必\" (must).\n\nZichan grieved over this day and night. Secretly, he sought Deng Xi’s counsel, the *Shiwen* notes: *Zao* (sought) is written as \"速\" (hurried), noting: The original reads *zao*, pronounced *qidao*. *Xi* is pronounced *xi*. Saying: “I have heard that governing the self extends to the family, and governing the family extends to the state—this speaks of proceeding from the near to the far. I have governed the state well, yet my family is in chaos. Is my Way perverse? How should I save these two sons? Please instruct them!” Deng Xi replied: “I have long found this strange but dared not speak first. Why not govern them in due time, enlightening them on the weight of life and fate, and enticing them with the dignity of ritual and righteousness?”\n\n[Exegesis] Enlightening them on life and fate, enticing them with ritual and righteousness—this aims to curb their indulgent passions, tempting them with the allure of high rank and eminence, which are the ultimate goals of worldly fame and profit.\n\nZichan followed Deng Xi’s advice. Taking advantage of an opportunity, he visited his brothers and addressed them, the *Shiwen* notes: *Jian* (opportunity) is pronounced *jian*. Saying: “What makes humans noble above beasts is wisdom and foresight. What wisdom and foresight guide is ritual and righteousness. When ritual and righteousness are perfected, fame and position follow. If you act on impulse, indulging in desires, your life and fate will be imperiled.”\n\nZichan heeded Jiao’s words, and by morning he would repent, by evening he would enjoy emolument.”\n\nZhaomu said: “I have long known this, and long chosen it. The paths of action are manifold—one selects what one prefers and acts accordingly. How could I await your words to recognize it? Life is hard to encounter, death is easy to reach. With life so hard to encounter, to wait for death so easy to reach—how could one not ponder this deeply? Yet you would exalt ritual and righteousness to impress others, feign temperament and nature to seek fame. To me, this is no better than death.\n\nHow penetrating are these words! As for those who painstakingly follow convention, violate their nature to comply with things, forfeit the fleeting joy of the present, and harbor lifelong sorrow—though their limbs remain intact, they are already near death. To desire the full enjoyment of life’s delights, to exhaust the year’s pleasures, one need only fear a bloated belly that prevents unrestrained drinking, or weariness that bars indulgence in sensuality. One has no leisure to fret over the disgrace of reputation or the peril of life and fate.\n\nMoreover, do you intend to flaunt your governance skills to impress others, to use specious words to disturb my heart, to delight my mind with rank and emolument? Is this not base and pitiable? I would further distinguish this from your way.\n\nOne who excels at governing the external may not bring order to things but will exhaust himself; one who excels at governing the internal may not bring chaos to things but will harmonize his nature. Your way of governing the external may be briefly enforced in one state, yet it does not accord with human hearts. My way of governing the internal may be extended to all under heaven, and the Way of ruler and minister will cease.\n\nI have long wished to explain this method to you, yet you instead instruct me in that method?”\n\n*Note: The text originally read, “I have long wished to explain this method to you, yet you instead instruct me in that method?” The repetition of “you” was indicated by a mark in the original, later miscopied as “之若,” resulting in the present error.*\n\nZichan was left speechless, unable to respond.\n\n[Exegesis] Those who pursue passion and indulge desire wield cunning words and perverse arguments sufficient to silence the mouths of sages and disrupt the laws of all under heaven. Thus, Jie and Zhou’s intelligence could adorn their wrongdoing, and Shaowu’s rhetoric could bewilder the masses. Though they may not have prevailed in their time, they stirred up their era. Thus, the Master was confounded by the words of Robber Zhi, and Zichan was stymied by Zhaomu’s speech—no great regret. Yet the deluded believe *Liezi* recounts this to express its sentiment, and Zhang Zhan annotates it to elucidate its principle. Such is the common taste of the vulgar—how could it be the refined art of the Dao’s lineage?\n\nHu Huaichen notes: “忙然” is now commonly written as “茫然.”\n\n*Note: The exegesis originally read, “the Master was confounded by the words of Robber Zhi,” referring to the episode in the *Zhuangzi*, “Robber Zhi.”*\n\nLater, Zichan reported this to Deng Xi.\n\nDeng Xi said: “You lived alongside a true person yet did not recognize him—how can you be called wise? The governance of Zheng was merely coincidental, not your achievement.”\n\n*[Annotation:]*\nNot knowing a true person, one cannot govern a state; governance is but a matter of chance.\n\nThis entire passage is too blunt and confrontational in its rhetoric, lacking the tone of a gentleman. Yet its intent is to relieve the burdens of those who constrain themselves, hence its excessively unrestrained words.\n\n*[Exegesis:]*\nWhen rewards are given according to ability and appointments made by virtue, the worthy advance day by day while the unworthy retreat. If appointments are made solely by talent, the Way of the good prospers; if the unworthy are inevitably dismissed, the Way of the petty incurs no resentment. Let the worthy and unworthy each settle into their proper place and fulfill their aspirations, and the governance of Zheng will be fitting.\n\nThose two men indulged in wine and sensual pleasures, neglecting ritual and righteousness. They did not rely on the influence of fathers and elder brothers to seize opportunities, but followed their desires without remorse—these were truly true persons. Yet you sought to correct their conduct and feign their intentions, seizing emoluments and rank for private gain. That the state happened to be well-ordered was no credit to your impartiality—how could this be called wisdom?\n\nHere, “true person” does not refer to a truly sagely individual, but to one who is genuinely without talent.\n\n*[Annotation:]*\nThe character *tai* (太) in the *Shidetang* edition appears as *da* (大).\n\nLu Wenchang notes: In the *Zhuangzi*, the phrase “jingting” (径挺) appears as “jingting” (径庭) or “jingtin” (俓侹).\n\nQin Enfu observes: In the exegesis, “wei qi xin” (为其心), *wei* (为) and *wei* (伪) were interchangeable in ancient script. Yang Liang’s commentary on the *Xunzi*’s “Xing’e” chapter states: “‘Wei’ means ‘to do’ or ‘to feign.’ Anything not of innate nature but contrived by humans is called *wei*. Thus, the character *wei* (伪) combines *ren* (人) and *wei* (为), forming a compound ideograph.”\n\nThe *Shiwen* renders “jingting” (径挺) as “jingtin” (径廷), with *ting* (廷) pronounced *ting* (听). *Kang* (抗) is pronounced *kang* (苦浪切). *Qu* (去) is pronounced *qǔ* (丘吕切). *Lei* (累) is read in the falling tone.\n\nWei’s Duanmu Shu was a descendant of Zigong. *[Exegesis by Bo Jun:]* The *Strategies of Qin* states: “Marshlands can be bequeathed to posterity,” with the annotation: “‘Posterity’ refers to later generations.” The *Discourses of Jin* reads: “Without virtue, one does not reach the age,” with the annotation: “‘Age’ means succession.” Thus, “descendant of Zigong” refers to Zigong’s posterity. Below, it says “relying on his ancestral wealth,” meaning he relied on Zigong’s wealth, for Zigong was skilled in commerce. Shallow-minded people, not grasping the meaning of *shi* (世, “posterity”), arbitrarily added the character *fu* (父, “father”). The *Taiping Yulan* (477 and 493) both cite it as “Shifu” (世父), but this is incorrect. However, the citation in volume 830 omits *fu* (父), avoiding the error. Others have mistakenly added *zi* (子), as in the *Bai-Kong Liutie* (19).\n\n“Relying on his ancestral wealth.” *[Exegesis by Bo Jun:]* The *Guanzi*’s “Neiye” chapter states: “That which comes of itself may be relied upon for counsel,” with the annotation: “‘Rely’ means ‘to depend upon.’” The *Shiwen* glosses *zi* (赀) as *zi* (髭).\n\nThe household amassed wealth of ten thousand gold. He paid no heed to worldly affairs, indulging whatever he fancied. As the *Shiwen* notes: *hao* (好, “fancy”) is pronounced *hu bao*, and the same applies below. Whatever the people desired to do, whatever the human heart longed to enjoy—nothing was left undone, nothing left unindulged. Walls and houses, terraces and pavilions, gardens and parks, ponds and pools, food and drink, carriages and robes, music and concubines—he rivaled the lords of Qi and Chu. As for what his nature craved, what his ears longed to hear, his eyes to see, his mouth to taste—even if it came from distant lands or remote regions (the commentary notes: *pian*, 偏, means “remote”), or was not native to Qi, he spared no effort to obtain it. Yu Yue observes: The passage below reads, “Though mountains and rivers barred the way, though paths stretched long and far, nothing was left unvisited,” so this passage should read “nothing was left unobtained,” with the extra *zhi* (之) being an erroneous interpolation. Yet to him, such things were as readily at hand as objects within a garden fence. The *Shiwen* writes *fan* (藩) as *fan* (蕃), glossing it *fu yuan*. Ren Dachun notes: The *Zhouli*’s *Da Situ* commentary states, “Du Zichun reads *fan yue* (蕃樂) as *fan yue* (藩樂).” The *Shi*’s “Breaking willows for the garden fence” has the *Shiwen* gloss: “*Fan* (樊) means *fan* (藩), and is also written *fan* (蕃).” The *Han Yi*’s *Shiwen* concurs. The *Zuozhuan*’s twenty-eighth year *Shiwen* reads, “*Fan* (藩) is also written *fan* (蕃).” The *Chu Yu* states, “They made for it gates and bolts, *fan li* (蕃籬),” with Wei Zhao’s commentary: “*Fan li* (蕃籬) means walls and enclosures; *fan li* (蕃籬) is the same as *fan li* (藩籬),” showing that *fan* (藩) and *fan* (蕃) are interchangeable.\n\nWhen he traveled, though mountains and rivers barred the way (the *Shiwen* writes *zu xian* (阻險) as *ju yan* (岨崄), noting that *ju* (岨) is the same as *zu* (阻), and *yan* (崄) the same as *xian* (險)), though paths stretched long and far, nothing was left unvisited—it was as effortless as taking a single step. The *Shiwen* glosses *zhi* (咫) as *zhi* (紙). Guests filled his courtyard daily by the hundreds. Yu Yue states: *Zhu* (住) should be *shu* (數), a phonetic error. The *Huangdi* chapter reads: “The flocking birds arrived by the hundreds without cease,” with Zhang’s commentary: “*Zhu* (住) should be *shu* (數),” confirming this. This passage in Lu Chongxuan’s edition reads *wang* (往), which is a mistaken character. The *Shiwen* notes: *Zhu* (住) is pronounced *se zhu*, and is also written *wang* (往). Smoke never ceased rising from his kitchens (the *Shiwen* writes *pao* (庖) as *bao* (胞), glossing it *pu jiao*, and noting it is also written *pao* (庖)). Ren Dachun observes: The *Kao Ji Tong* states, “*Bao* (胞) refers to the lowliest of meat-officials,” with the commentary: “*Bao* (胞) means *pao* (庖).” The *Zhuangzi*’s “Gengsang Chu” chapter reads: “Thus Tang used *bao* (胞) and *chu* (厨) to ensnare Yi Yin.” The *Hanshu*’s *Dongfang Shuo Zhuan* reads: “*Bao* (胞) official Yin Yan,” with Yan Shigu’s commentary: “*Bao* (胞) and *pao* (庖) share the same meaning,” showing that *pao* (庖) and *bao* (胞) are interchangeable. Music never ceased playing in his halls and corridors. The *Shiwen* glosses *wu* (庑) as *wu* (武).\n\nWhat remained after his own provision was first distributed to his clan; what remained after the clan was next distributed to his village; what remained after the village was then distributed throughout the state. At sixty years of age, his *qi* and vigor waning, he abandoned his household affairs, dispersing all his storehouses, treasures, carriages, robes, concubines, and attendants. Within a year, he exhausted it all, leaving no wealth for his descendants. The *Shiwen* glosses *wei* (為) as *yu wei* (于偽). When he fell ill, he had no store of medicines or stones; when he died, he had no resources for burial. The commentary notes: One who grasps the Dao understands the impermanence of all things and the fleeting nature of wealth. Its accumulation is not one’s own achievement, so one fulfills the proper measure of provision; its dispersal is not one’s own gift, so one clarifies that things do not permanently gather. Such a person—how could mere fame or ritual and law restrain him? The *Shiwen* glosses *shi* (施) as *shi chi* (始豉), and the same applies below.\n\nThose in the state who received his gifts—Wang Chongmin notes: The *Taiping Yulan* (493) omits *ren* (人) after *zhi* (之)—joined together to contribute and bury him. Yu Yue states: *Fu* (賦) means calculating by household to raise funds. The *Zhouli*’s *Da Zai* commentary by Zheng Xuan reads: “*Fu* (賦) means a per-person levy of coin.” The *Hanshu*’s *Shi Huo Zhi*, in Yan Shigu’s commentary, reads: “*Fu* (賦) means calculating by household to raise wealth,” which clarifies its meaning. *Zang* (藏) here means burial, as in the *Liji*’s “Tan Gong” chapter: “Burial is *zang* (藏),” so *zang* (葬) and *zang* (藏) are interchangeable. The *Yi Jing*’s *Xi Ci Zhuan* reads: “Buried in the wilds,” while the *Hanshu*’s *Liu Xiang Zhuan* quotes it as “*Zang* (臧) in the wilds,” with *zang* (臧) being the same as *zang* (藏). Since Duanmu Shu had no resources for burial, those who received his gifts pooled their contributions to bury him, returning his descendants’ wealth to them.\n\nQin Gu (the commentary notes: also written Qu Li) heard of this and said: “Duanmu Shu was a madman, bringing shame upon his ancestors.” Duangan Sheng heard of it and said: “Duanmu Shu was an enlightened man, his virtue surpassing that of his ancestors. Wang Chongmin notes: The *Taiping Yulan* (493) writes *Duangan Sheng* (段干生) as *Duangan Mu* (段干木), which should be followed. The *Shiwen* glosses *guo* (過) as *ge* (戈). What he did, what he pursued, shocked the common mind, yet was affirmed by true principle. The gentlemen of Wei, who rigidly upheld ritual and teaching, were fundamentally incapable of understanding such a man’s heart.”\n\nMeng Sunyang asked Yang Zhu: “Suppose there were a man here who valued life and cherished his body, seeking immortality—would that be possible?” The *Shiwen* glosses *qi* (蕲) as *qi* (祈), and Yang Zhu replied: “In principle, there is no immortality.”\n\n“If one sought long life, would that be possible?”\nYang Zhu replied: “In principle, there is no long life. Life is not preserved by valuing it, nor is the body enriched by cherishing it. Moreover, what would be the purpose of long life?\n\n[Note] Even if long life were granted, it would not be what one truly desires. The five passions—love and hate—remain the same in ancient times as now; the safety or peril of the four limbs, the same; the bitterness or joy of worldly affairs, the same; the alternations of order and chaos, the same. We have heard of these things, seen them, and experienced them.\n\n[Lu's note] *Geng* (更) means to undergo or experience. The *Records of the Grand Historian*, in the \"Biographies of Dayuan,\" states: \"The Han, then intent on destroying the Hu, upon hearing these words, wished to establish communication. The route would necessarily pass through the Xiongnu.\" The *Suoyin* commentary explains: \"*Geng* means to traverse.\" The word applies equally to the traversal of a journey and the experience of life.\n\n[Shiwen] *Geng* is pronounced *geng* (庚).\n\nA hundred years would still feel too long—how much more the suffering of long life?”\n\n[Note] The experiences of a single lifetime are thus: now love, now hate; now safety, now peril, like an endless cycle. If one were to consider this joy? Then the return of what has already come would bring no renewed delight. If one were to consider this suffering? Then the afflictions of the self cannot be endured again. Thus, the longer one lives, the more sorrows accumulate.\n\n[Shiwen] *Chong* (重) is pronounced *zhong* (柱用切); *fu* (复) is pronounced *fu* (扶又切).\n\nMeng Sunyang said: “If that is so, then swift death is preferable to long life. In that case, to tread upon blades or plunge into boiling water would achieve one’s aim.”\n\nYangzi said: “Not so. Once born, one should relinquish and entrust all to the natural course, exhausting one’s desires while awaiting death.\n\n[Note] One ought simply to indulge one’s nature until the end.\n\nWhen death approaches, one should again relinquish and entrust all to the natural course, exhausting whither it leads, and thus release oneself to the end.\n\n[Note] Since control does not lie with me, there is nothing to cling to or long for.\n\nNothing is not relinquished, nothing is not entrusted—why then hasten or delay between these?”\n\nYang Zhu said: “Bocheng Zigao did not use even a single hair to benefit others, relinquishing his state to live in reclusion and till the soil.\n\n[Shiwen] *She* (舍) is pronounced *she* (舍).\n\n[Bo Jun’s note] “有” should be an error for “音.”\n\nThe Great Yu did not use his own body for self-benefit,\n\n[Shiwen] “不以一身自利” is also written as “不以一身利物.”\n\nhis body withered in part.\n\nThe ancients would not yield even a single hair to benefit the world, nor would they accept the whole world offering itself to a single person. If each person neither yields a single hair nor seeks to benefit the world, the world would be well-ordered.”\n\n[Note] *Rongzhai Xubi* 14 omits the two characters “人人” before “不利.”\n\n[Shiwen] *Zhi* (治) is pronounced *zhi* (直吏切).\n\nQinzi asked Yang Zhu: “Would you remove a single hair from your body to save the world?\n\n[Shiwen] *Qu* (去) is pronounced *qu* (丘吕切).\n\n[Note] Doubting that Yangzi valued the body excessively, he posed this question.\n\n[Shiwen] “太” is written as “大,” pronounced *tai* (泰).\n\nYangzi said: “The world is certainly not saved by a single hair.”\n\n[Note] Finding his question to miss the point of his own intent, he thus answered in kind.\n\nQinzi said: “Suppose it could be saved—would you do it?”\n\n[Bo Jun’s note] This exchange is likely based on *Mencius*’s *Jinxin I*: “Yangzi took ‘for oneself’ as his principle; if plucking a single hair could benefit the world, he would not do it.”\n\nYangzi did not respond. Qinzi went out and spoke to Meng Sunyang.\n\n[Shiwen] *Yu* (语) is pronounced *yu* (鱼据切).\n\nMeng Sunyang said: “You do not grasp the Master’s intent. Allow me to explain. If by harming your skin you could gain ten thousand gold, would you do it?” He replied: “I would.”\n\nMeng Sunyang said: “If by severing one of your limbs you could gain a state, would you do it?”\n\n[Shiwen] *Duan* (断) is pronounced *duan* (短).\n\n[Bo Jun’s note] The *Wen Xuan*’s “Letter from Ruan Yu to Cao Gong for Sun Quan” reads: “It is not a matter of encroaching upon one’s skin or inflicting injury,” which may be the source of this spurious remark.\n\nQinzi was silent for a while. Meng Sunyang said: “A single hair is smaller than skin, and skin is smaller than a limb—this is evident.\n\n[Note] *Sheng* (省) means to examine.\n\n[Shiwen] *Sheng* (省) is pronounced *sheng* (息井切).\n\nYet skin is accumulated from single hairs, and limbs are accumulated from skin. A single hair is surely one ten-thousandth of the body—how can it be treated lightly?”\n\nQinzi said: “I cannot answer you on these terms. Yet if your words were put to Lao Dan and Guan Yin, then your words would be correct.\n\n[Note] The teachings of Lao Dan and Guan Yin value the body and deprecate external things.\n\n[Shiwen] *Dang* (当) is pronounced *dang* (丁浪切).\n\nIf my words were put to the Great Yu and Mo Di,\n\n[Shiwen] *Di* (翟) is pronounced *di* (狄).\n\nthen my words would be correct.”\n\n[Note] The teachings of Yu and Mo forget the self to save others.\n\nMeng Sunyang then turned and spoke of other matters with his disciples.\n\nYang Zhu said: “The world’s praise gathers upon Shun, Yu, the Zhou, and Confucius; the world’s blame gathers upon Jie and Zhou. Yet Shun tilled the fields at Heyang and made pottery at Leize,\n\n[Shiwen] According to the *Records of the Historian*, Shun tilled at Lishan and made pottery by the river. Today, this refers to Puyang and Leize County.\n\nhis limbs never knew a moment’s rest, his mouth and belly never tasted fine fare; his parents did not love him, his brothers and sisters did not treat him with affection.”\n\nAt thirty, he married without informing his parents.\n\n[Shiwen] *Gao* (告) is pronounced *gao* (古沃切). To report to superiors is *gao*; to issue proclamations to inferiors is *gao* (诰).\n\nBy the time he received Yao’s abdication, he was already advanced in years,\n\n[Shiwen] *Zhang* (长) is pronounced *zhang* (张丈切).\n\nand his wisdom had declined. Shangjun was unworthy,\n\n[Shiwen] *Jun* (钧) is pronounced *jun* (均).\n\nyet he ceded the throne to Yu, living in constant sorrow until his death. This was the utmost suffering of a celestial being.\n\n[Northern Song edition omits the character *zhi* (之).]\n\nJiang Chaobo remarked: *Zhuangzi*’s *Xu Wugui* chapter echoes this sentiment, altering the phrasing: “The one who curled up in toil was Shun. Shun had a foul reputation, yet the people delighted in him. Yao, hearing of Shun’s worthiness, raised him from the barren lands. Though his years were advanced and his faculties had waned, he could not return to rest—this was the one who curled up in toil.”\n\nGun, tasked with regulating the waters and lands,\n\n[Shiwen] *Gun* () is pronounced *gun* (古本切). The name of Yu’s father; alternate character: □.\n\nfailed in his endeavors and was banished to Feather Mountain. Yu inherited the task and avenged his father’s grievance, devoting himself solely to the wild lands. He did not raise his son, nor did he enter his own home when passing by;\n\n[Shiwen] *Guo* (过) is pronounced *guo* (戈).\n\nhis body became emaciated, his hands and feet calloused.\n\n[Shiwen] *Pianzhi* (胼胝) is written as *pianzhi* (跰□). *Pian* (跰) is pronounced *pian* (步千切); *zhi* (□) is pronounced *zhi* (丁湜切).\n\nUpon receiving Shun’s abdication,\n\n[Shiwen] *Shan* (禅) is pronounced *shan* (善).\n\nhe lived in humble dwellings,\n\n[Shiwen] *Bei* (卑) is written as *bi* (蔽). Pronounced *bi* (弊) or *bei* (卑).\n\nRen Dachun noted: *Bei* (卑) and *bi* (蔽) share a phonetic connection, hence *bi* is pronounced both *bi* (敝) and *bei* (卑). The *Shiwen* of the *Artificers’ Record* states: “The wheelwright’s *lunbi* (轮箄) is pronounced *boji* (薄计反).” The *Records of the Historian*, *Biography of the Marquis of Huaiyin*, reads: “He took a hidden path, concealing himself in the mountains.” Ru Chun commented: “*Bi* (萆) is pronounced *bi* (蔽), meaning to conceal oneself behind the mountain.” *Bi* (箄) is derived from *bei* (卑), yet both are read as *bi* (蔽). Thus, *bi* (蔽) may be pronounced *bi* (敝) or *bei* (卑). The rendering of *bei gongshi* (卑宫室) as *bi gongshi* (蔽宫室) arises from the phonetic proximity of *bei* (卑) and *bi* (蔽).\n\nhe wore fine robes and crowns, living in constant sorrow until his death. This was the utmost hardship of a celestial being.\n\nAfter King Wu’s passing, King Cheng was young and weak, and the Duke of Zhou assumed the regency of the Son of Heaven. The Duke of Shao was displeased, and rumors spread among the four states. Exiled to the east for three years, he executed his brother and banished his kin, barely preserving his own life.\n\n[Shiwen] *Jin* (仅) is pronounced *jin* (觐).\n\nHe lived in constant fear until his death. This was the utmost peril of a celestial being.\n\nConfucius expounded the Way of the emperors and kings, responding to the summons of contemporary rulers. He was barred from felling a tree in Song, erased from the records in Wei, impoverished in Shang and Zhou, besieged in Chen and Cai.\n\n[The Qin engraving and Lu Jie’s edition read *kun* (困) for *wei* (围).]\n\nYu Yue remarked: *Wei* (围) is a scribal error for *kun* (困).\n\nHe was humiliated by the Ji family and disgraced by Yang Hu, living in constant sorrow until his death. This was the utmost restlessness of a man of the world.\n\nThese four sages, in life, knew not a single day of joy; in death, they gained a name for ten thousand generations. Yet a name is not something real that can be grasped. Though praised, they knew it not; though rewarded, they knew it not—no different from a stump or a clod of earth.\n\n[Shiwen] *Zhu* (株) is pronounced *zhu* (诛); *kuai* (块) is pronounced *kui* (口对切).\n\n[Note] Observing their forms and deeds, the traces of their sorrows and perils are manifest. Searching within their hearts, there is none who did not suffer grievances. To elucidate the words of the utmost principle, one must present the extremes of good and evil in parallel.\n\nJie inherited the resources of generations, occupying the honored seat of the ruler. His wisdom sufficed to resist his ministers, his might sufficed to awe the realm. He indulged his ears and eyes in whatever pleased him, exhausting the depths of his desires, living in carefree abandon until his death. This was the utmost dissipation of a man of the world.\n\nZhou, too, inherited the resources of generations, occupying the honored seat of the ruler. His authority knew no bounds, his will no opposition. He gave free rein to his passions in the Leaning Palace, indulged his desires in endless nights;\n\nThe *Shiwen* notes that \"纵\" is written as \"从\", reading *cong* as *zong*, and the same applies below. They did not afflict themselves with ritual and righteousness, living in carefree abandon until their execution: these were the most dissolute of men under Heaven.\n\nThose two tyrants, in life, enjoyed the pleasures of indulging their desires; in death, bore the name of folly and violence. In truth, such men are fundamentally untouched by reputation. Though slandered, they knew it not; though praised, they knew it not. Yu Yue notes: The preceding text speaks of Shun, Yu, the Zhou, and Confucius, saying, \"Though praised, they knew it not; though rewarded, they knew it not.\" Thus, in discussing Jie and Zhou, it should read, \"Though slandered, they knew it not; though punished, they knew it not.\" \"Slandered\" pairs with \"praised,\" and \"punished\" with \"rewarded,\" aligning with the later passage: \"Those four sages, though the destination of all praise; those two tyrants, though the destination of all blame.\" \"Praised and rewarded\" are the destination of praise; \"slandered and punished\" are the destination of blame. Here, following the earlier text by also using \"praised\" renders the meaning incoherent. How do they differ from clods of earth?\n\n**[Annotation]** They exhausted the extremes of arrogance and extravagance, indulging their insatiable natures. Though nourished by all under Heaven, they never found contentment in their hearts. This was truly a life of year-long suffering and distress. The *Shiwen* notes: *Jin* (尽) is read as *zǐrěn*; *yàn* (厌) as *yīyán*; *qiè* (惬) as *kǒutiē*.\n\nThose four sages, though the destination of all praise, toiled to the end of their days, and all alike met death. Those two tyrants, though the destination of all blame, reveled to the end of their days—*Shiwen* notes: *lè* (乐) is read as *luò*—and likewise all met death.\n\nYang Zhu met with the King of Liang. Speaking of governing the realm, he said it was as easy as turning one’s palm. Wang Chongmin notes: *Leiju* 94 cites this as \"King Hui of Liang,\" and the following \"the King said\" omits the word \"Liang.\" Wang Shumin notes: *Shilei Fu* 22 includes the word \"初\" before \"Yang Zhu.\" *Wen Xuan* commentary on Dongfang Manqian’s *Response to a Guest’s Objections*, *Shiwen Leiju* (later collection) 39, *Yunfu Qunyu* 6, and *Tianzhong Ji* 54 all include the word \"Hui\" after \"Liang.\"\n\nThe King said: \"Sir, you cannot even govern one wife and one concubine, nor tend three *mu* of garden; yet you claim governing the realm is as easy as turning your palm. Why is this?\" Yang Zhu replied: \"Have you seen those who herd sheep? Wang Chongmin notes: The words \"见其\" are reversed in error. *Leiju* 94 writes \"其\" as \"夫,\" which also works (*Shuo Yuan*’s *Zhengli* chapter reads: \"Have you not seen the sheep?\"). Bo Jun’s note: *Qi* (其) means *bi* (彼). 'Have you seen those who herd sheep?' is akin to 'Have you seen *those* who herd sheep?' The use of *qi* to mean *bi* is explained in Zhongfu’s *Advanced Chinese Grammar* and *Word Explications*. A hundred sheep in a flock, led by a five-*chi* boy carrying a switch and following behind—Wang Chongmin notes: *Leiju* 94 writes the first \"而\" as \"为,\" which is likely correct. The ancient character for *wei* (为) was written as □, easily confused with *er* (而). This book’s *Yellow Emperor* chapter reads: \"Those who attain this and exhaust it—how could they be upright?\" *Zhuangzi*’s *Dasheng* chapter reads: \"How could things restrain them?\" The *Jifu* edition of *Liezi* reads: \"How could they be corrected?\"—this is evidence. Wang Shumin notes: *Taiping Yulan* 833, *Shiwen Leiju* (later collection) 39, and *Tianzhong Ji* 54 all write \"而群\" as \"为群.\" Wang’s point is valid. If they wish to go east, they go east; if west, they go west. But if Yao were to lead a single sheep, with Shun carrying the switch and following behind, they could not move forward.\n\nMoreover, I have heard: fish that can swallow a boat do not swim in shallow streams; the great swan soars high and does not alight in filthy ponds. Why? Their aspirations are lofty.\"\n\nWang Shumin states: The *Shuo Yuan*’s *Zhengli* chapter and the *Jinlouzi*’s *Liyan Xia* chapter both include the character *zhi* (志) after \"其,\" and this should be followed. The subsequent text reads: \"Why? Their tones are sparse.\" Here, *zhi* (志) and *yin* (音) stand in parallel. The grand harmonies of *huangzhong* and *dalü* cannot accompany frantic, clamorous dances. Why? Their tones are sparse.\n\nThe character *zhong* (钟) appears as *zhong* (锺) in Wang’s edition and is identical in the *Jifu* edition; here, it follows the standard versions. Tao Hongqing notes: \"奏\" should be \"凑.\" *Cou* means convergence. Those who govern the great do not govern the petty; those who achieve great deeds do not fuss over trifles—this is what it means.\n\nYang Zhu said: \"The affairs of the distant past have vanished—who records them? The deeds of the Three Sovereigns exist as if they exist not, the affairs of the Five Emperors seem like waking dreams (as the *Shiwen* notes: *jue* is read as *jiao*). The undertakings of the Three Kings appear now hidden, now manifest—of a hundred million, one is not known. (As the *Shiwen* notes: *shi* is read as in the standard pronunciation, or as *zhi* below, and similarly hereafter.) The events of one’s own lifetime are sometimes heard, sometimes seen—of ten thousand, one is not known. The matters before one’s eyes now exist, now cease—of a thousand, one is not known. From the distant past to the present, the years are indeed beyond counting. Yet since Fuxi’s time, over three hundred thousand years have passed, and all—wisdom and folly, beauty and ugliness, success and failure, right and wrong—have dissolved into nothingness, differing only in the swiftness or slowness of their passing.\n\n[Annotation:] To be bewildered by such swiftness or slowness, to race endlessly in pursuit—is this not contemptible? To pride oneself on fleeting praise or blame, to wear body and spirit raw for it, and to seek a lingering name for a few hundred years after death (as the *Shiwen* notes: *yao* is read as in *yī yáo qiè*)—can this moisten dry bones? Where is the joy in life?\"\n\nYang Zhu said: \"Humans resemble the classes of Heaven and Earth, bearing the nature of the Five Constants. [Annotation:] *Xiao* means 'to resemble.' Alike in yin and yang, their nature follows the Five Phases. The *Shiwen* notes: *Xiao* is written as *qiao*, pronounced like *xiao*; some versions use *xiao*. Ren Dachun said: In the *Huainanzi*, 'to immerse in thoughts of *xiao* types,' Gao You annotates: '*Xiao* means things that resemble.' The *Hanshu: Xingfa Zhi* states: 'All people resemble the forms of Heaven and Earth.' Yan Shigu takes *xiao* as *xiao*, thus *xiao*, *qiao*, and *xiao* are interchangeable.\"\n\nOf all living beings, humans are the most spiritually endowed. Yet their claws and teeth are insufficient for defense, their skin and flesh inadequate for self-protection. The *Shiwen* notes: *Han* is written as *han*, pronounced like *han*. *Yu* is pronounced *yǔ*. Their swift movement is not enough to pursue benefit or flee harm—originally 'flee benefit and harm,' now corrected according to the Dunhuang manuscript S.7776. Bo Jun notes: The *Shuowen* states: '□ means to hasten.' The *Shiming* says: 'Slow walking is called *bu*, swift walking *qu*, and hasty movement *zou*.' The *Lüshi Chunqiu: Quanxun* reads: 'The King of Qi fled to Ju,' with the annotation: '*Zou* means to flee.' The *Shiwen* writes *qu* as *qu*, pronounced *qū*.\n\nDevoid of fur or feathers to shield against cold and heat, humans must rely on external things for sustenance. All versions include 'nature' after 'sustenance,' now deleted following the Dunhuang manuscript S.7776. They employ wisdom rather than brute force. Thus, what wisdom values is preserving the self; what force disdains is encroaching upon others. Yet the body does not belong to oneself—once born, one cannot but preserve it. Things do not belong to oneself—once possessed, one cannot discard them. 'Cannot discard them'—the Northern Song, Wang, Qin block-printed Lu, and Shidetang editions all read 'cannot but discard them.' Yu Yue said: It should read 'cannot discard them,' as the following text states: 'Though one does not discard things, one cannot claim ownership of them.' The version 'cannot but discard' contradicts the subsequent passage, likely influenced by the earlier 'once born, one cannot but preserve it,' mistakenly changing *er* to *bu*. Bo Jun notes: Yu Yue's argument is sound; the Daoist Canon's unannotated text, Lin Xiyi's edition, and the Jifu edition correctly use *er*. Here, the text is amended accordingly. The *Shiwen* writes 'er qu' as 'bu qu,' with *qu* pronounced *qù*.\n\nThe body is indeed the master of life, just as things are the master of sustenance. Though one preserves life, all versions include 'body' after 'life,' now deleted following the Dunhuang manuscript S.7776—one cannot claim ownership of the body. Though one does not discard things, one cannot claim ownership of them. To claim ownership of things or the body is to wrongfully appropriate the bodies and things of the world. The *Shiwen* notes: *Heng* is pronounced with the falling tone, as below. Those who neither wrongfully appropriate the bodies nor the things of the world—all versions omit these fourteen characters, now restored from the Dunhuang manuscript—are none other than the sages! [Annotation:] Only the sage understands that the body cannot be privately owned, nor things possessed.\n\nTao Hongqing said: Zhang's annotation misplaces the punctuation. 'Are none other than the sages' should be read with the following, forming an inverted sentence: 'Are none other than the sages—those who share the bodies of the world, share the things of the world—are none other than the perfected!' This both praises their sagacity and acknowledges their perfection. The *Yi Jing: Qian Gua Wenyan* states: 'Are none other than the sages! Those who know advance and retreat, life and death, yet do not lose their correctness—are none other than the sages!' The syntax is identical. Bo Jun notes: Tao's edition omits the fourteen characters 'neither wrongfully appropriate,' hence his argument. With these characters restored, Tao's interpretation is no longer tenable. The *Shiwen* connects the following passage as a single segment: 'Those who share the bodies of the world, share the things of the world—are none other than the perfected!' This is called the utmost of the utmost. [Annotation:] To regard the bodies of the world as one's own body, the things of the world as one's own things—who but the perfected can achieve this? Having realized the error of selfishness and the rightness of impartiality, this is called the utmost of the utmost.\n\nYang Zhu said: \"The people cannot rest because of four concerns: The *Shiwen* notes: *Wei* is pronounced *wéi*, as below. First, for longevity, [Annotation:] They dare not indulge their desires. Second, for reputation, [Annotation:] They dare not act recklessly. Third, for status, [Annotation:] They compromise to seek advancement. The Shidetang edition mistakenly writes 'emerge' instead of 'compromise.' Fourth, for wealth. [Annotation:] They monopolize profit and hoard expenses.\"\n\nThose who harbor these four concerns fear ghosts, fear others, fear authority, and fear punishment—such are called the \"reclusive people.\" [Annotation:] Those who violate their natural state. The character *min* (\"people\") was originally written as *ren* (\"person\"); the Dunhuang fragmentary scrolls write *min*. Wang Chongmin states: *Ren* should be *min*; Song editions failed to correct the Tang taboo. Bo Jun notes: Wang’s argument is sound, and the text has been amended accordingly. Wang Chongmin further states: The *Yilin* quotes it as \"these are called the 'reclusive people'\"; this reading should be adopted. The following passage reads, \"these are called the 'compliant people,'\" with identical sentence structure. Wang Shumin notes: Jiang Yu’s commentary reads, \"these are called the 'reclusive people,'\" and the version he consulted also preserves the correct order of *zhi wei* (\"are called\"). [Annotation:] *Dun* is pronounced *dùn*.\n\nTheir lives may be taken or spared, for control over their fate lies beyond themselves. [Annotation:] When whole, they are not bound to their own will. Bo Jun notes: *Huó* (\"live\") and *wài* (\"beyond\") rhyme, sharing the same ancient sound in the *zhi* rhyme group.\n\nIf they do not resist fate, why crave longevity? If they do not prize nobility, why crave reputation?\n\nDo not crave power—[Annotation:] *Yào* is pronounced *yáo*. Why covet rank? Do not covet wealth, why covet goods? These are called the \"compliant people.\" [Annotation:] They attain the principle of life.\n\nThe world has no equal, for control over fate lies within. [Annotation:] It cannot be controlled by external things. [Annotation:] *Duì* (\"equal\") and *nèi* (\"within\") rhyme, sharing the same ancient sound in the *zhi* rhyme group.\n\nThus, the saying goes: \"When a man does not seek office, half his desires are lost; when a man does not depend on clothing and food, the Way of ruler and minister ceases.\" Jiang Yougao notes: *Huàn* (\"office\") and *bàn* (\"half\") rhyme, sharing the same ancient sound in the *yuan* rhyme group. *Shí* (\"food\") and *xī* (\"cease\") rhyme, sharing the same ancient sound in the *zhi* rhyme group.\n\nA Zhou proverb says—[Annotation:] *Yàn* is pronounced *yàn*—\"A field laborer may be killed by sitting still.\" [Annotation:] *Fù* is pronounced *fǔ*, the same below. Rising at dawn and retiring at dusk, he takes this as the constant of his nature; sipping bean broth and chewing coarse greens—[Annotation:] The *Jizuan Yuanhai*, chapter 57, cites *shuǐ* (\"water\") for *shū* (\"bean\"). [Annotation:] *Chuò* is pronounced *chuǎi*. *Rú* is read in the falling tone. *Huò* is pronounced *huò*.—he takes this as the height of flavor. His flesh is coarse and thick, [Annotation:] *Cū* is pronounced *cāng*, his sinews and joints taut and tense—[Annotation:] *□* is pronounced *qūwèi*. [Annotation:] The *Shiwen* writes *□* as *kuì*, noting: *Jīn* is pronounced *jīn*. It is read *kuì*, meaning \"sinews and joints tense.\" Alternatively written as *□□*, the first character is pronounced *quán*, the second *qūwèi*. *□chǒu* describes the appearance of tense sinews. Qin Enfu notes: The *Shiwen*’s \"read *kuì*\" refers to the pronunciation of *□*. *□* should be written as *□*. *□* belongs to the *guǐ* phonetic series, hence it is read *qūwèi*. If it were *□*, it would be read *zhīchūn*. The *Yupian* states: \"*□□*, an ugly appearance.\" *□* is written with the *yuè* radical and the *guàn* phonetic; *□* with the *yuè* radical and the *juǎn* phonetic. *Guàn* and *juǎn* are phonetic transformations. The *Huainanzi*’s *Xiumu Xun* writes it as *□*, with Gao You’s commentary: \"Read as *quánhéng*’s *quán*, pronounced with a tense tone. *□* is read *kuí*.\" That *kuí* is a reversal of *qūwèi* is clear proof. The *Erya*’s \"*qǔn* is its sprout\" is glossed by Guo as *qiǎnquǎn*, which is clear evidence that *kuì* is a corrupted character. [Annotation:] Zhang Zhan’s edition writes *□* as *□*; the *Huainanzi* writes it as *□*. Neither the \"mountain\" nor the \"mouth\" radical is correct—it should be the \"moon\" radical. Ren Dachun states: *□* has no *qūwèi* pronunciation and should be an error for *kuì*. Furthermore, the Shide Tang edition adds after \"sinews tense in appearance\" the six characters \"*yuē kuì yīn qūwèi qiè*,\" which the Daoist Canon edition omits in error. This is because alternate versions of the *Liezi* may write *□kuì*, and the *Shiwen* thus explains the two characters separately. Where it says \"*□* ugly,\" it glosses the meaning of *□*. The *Yupian*, *Guangya*, and *Guangyun* all state \"*□□* ugly in appearance,\" hence *□* ugly is used to explain the meaning of *□*. Where it says \"sinews tense in appearance is called *kuì*, pronounced *qūwèi*,\" it clarifies the difference in pronunciation and meaning between *kuì* and *□*. The Daoist Canon edition’s omission of the six characters from \"*yuē kuì*\" onward makes it seem as if *□* ugly is glossed as \"sinews tense in appearance,\" but *□* ugly has no such definition. [Annotation:] Bo Jun notes: Ren’s argument is incorrect. The five characters \"*kuì yīn qūwèi qiè*\" originally belong to Zhang’s commentary; the Shide Tang edition conflates them with the *Shiwen*, and Ren’s supplementation of the *Shiwen* based on the Shide Tang edition is unreliable. Furthermore, the *Yupian* and *Guangyun*’s \"*□□* ugly in appearance\" (the *Guangya*’s *Shigu* writes \"*□□* ugly\") should be read as *□□* together. Wang’s *Guangya Shuzheng* cites the *Huainanzi*’s *Xiumu Xun*: \"*kuīduō huī*,\" which is the *Guangya*’s \"*□huī□*,\" the same as this *□□*. Ren’s reading of *□* ugly is incorrect. However, the *Shiwen* also contains errors and omissions.\n\nIf one morning he is placed amidst soft furs and fine silk curtains—[Annotation:] *Tímò* is pronounced *tímò*—and offered fine grains, meats, orchids, and citrus, his heart will be vexed and his body restless, and internal heat will breed illness. [Annotation:] *□* is pronounced *yǎn*. The lords of Shang and Lu, equal in status to the field laborer—[Annotation:] *Móu* is pronounced *móu*—would likewise not endure even a single day before exhaustion. [Annotation:] To speak of what one is accustomed to: none of it can be abruptly changed, let alone what is natural. [Annotation:] *Zú* is pronounced in the falling tone.\n\nThus, what the rustic finds at ease, what the rustic finds beautiful, is deemed without peer in the world. Long ago, in the state of Song, there was a field laborer who always wore a garment of matted hemp—[Annotation:] Tangled flax. [Annotation:] The Shide Tang edition writes *fén* as *fén*, which is incorrect. [Annotation:] *Yì* is pronounced *yì*. *Yùn* is pronounced *yùn*. *Fén* is pronounced *fén*. *Yùnfén* refers to a garment made from torn hemp fibers. The *Han Shi Waizhuan* calls it \"a garment of mixed colors.\" Alternatively pronounced *fén*.—just enough to survive the winter.\n\nWhen spring arrived for the eastern labors—[Annotation:] The *Canon of Yao* states: *\"Yin welcomes the rising sun, and the eastern labors are arranged in order.\"* The apocryphal Kong commentary says: *\"The year begins in the east, and the commencement of plowing is called 'eastern labors.'\"* Zhao Qi’s annotation to the *Mencius* reads: *\"The Book says, 'The eastern labors are arranged in order,' referring to the management of agricultural affairs.\"* The *Book of Han*’s *Biography of Wang Mang* states: *\"In every county, plowing was practiced to encourage the eastern labors.\"* The *Records of Emperor Zhi of the Later Han* and the *Continuation of the Han’s Treatise on Ritual and Ceremonies* both say: *\"When spring arrives for the eastern labors,\"* providing further clear evidence. [Annotation:] *Jì* is pronounced *jì*.—he would bask in the sun himself—[Annotation:] Wang Shumin notes: *The Anthology of Categorized Matters*, *Imperial Digest*, and *Tianzhong Record* all quote *\"basking in the sun\"* as *\"basking in the sun in the fields,\"* with the addition of *\"admiring it\"* after *\"fields.\"* [Annotation:] *Pù* is pronounced *pù*.—unaware that the world contained spacious halls and secluded chambers, silk floss and fox-fur robes. [Annotation:] *Ào* is pronounced *ào*. [Annotation:] *Hé* is pronounced *hè*.\n\nHe turned to his wife and said: *\"The warmth of the sun on my back—[Annotation:] *Xuān* may be written as *nuǎn* (warm). [Annotation:] *Xuān* is pronounced *xuān*—no one else knows of it. If I present it to our lord, I shall receive a great reward.\"* A wealthy man of the village informed him: *\"In the past, there was a man who praised fine large beans, sweet *xǐ*-stemmed celery, water-pepper seeds, and *píng* to the village magnate. [Annotation:] The village magnate was the most honored man of the locality. [Annotation:] *Píng* is written as *pín* here. [Annotation:] *Róngshū* (large beans) was explained in the *Lì Mìng* chapter. *Xǐ* is pronounced *xǐlǐ*. *Xǐ* refers to *húxǐ* (cocklebur). The *Cāng Jié Piān* states: *□* is an ear [of grain]. It is also called *cāng’ěr* (cocklebur). *Xǐ* is colloquially pronounced *cǐ*. *□* is pronounced with the rising tone. The *Ěryǎ* states: *Píng* is *fúróng* (water-pepper). Also, *píng* is *lài xiāo* (reed). Guo’s commentary notes: This is today’s *lài hāo* (wormwood), which is edible when young. The magnate took some and tasted it, but it stung his mouth [Annotation:] *Zhé* is pronounced *zhé*—and pained his stomach. [Annotation:] *Cǎn* is pronounced *qiān gǎn*. *Cǎn* and *zhé* both mean *pain*. The crowd laughed at him and resented him. [Annotation:] *Shěn* is pronounced *shì rěn*. The man was deeply ashamed. You, sir, are of this same sort.\"*\n\nLiu Xiaobiao notes: In the *Wen Xuan*, Ji Kang’s *\"Letter Breaking Off Relations with Shan Juyuan\"* states, \"There was a rustic who, delighted by roasting his back in the sun and finding water-cress delicious, wished to present them to the emperor.\" This shows the legend already existed, and the compiler of the *Liezi* incorporated it into this chapter.\n\nYang Zhu said: \"Grand mansions, fine robes, rich flavors, and beautiful women—with these four, what more could one seek externally? Yet those who possess them and still seek beyond are of insatiable nature. Such insatiable nature is the moth that gnaws at yin and yang. [Annotation:] It not only burdens the self but also erodes the upright qi.\"\n\n[Annotation:] The character *其* in the note appears as *正* in the *Shidetang* edition, which is incorrect.\n\n[Annotation:] *Dù* is pronounced *dù*. *Lěi* is read in the falling tone.\n\n\"Loyalty is insufficient to secure the ruler’s peace and only endangers the self; righteousness is insufficient to benefit others and only harms one’s life. Peace for superior and subject does not arise from loyalty, yet the name of loyalty is extinguished; benefit to others does not arise from righteousness, yet the name of righteousness is lost. When ruler and subject are at peace and self and others both profit—this was the Way of antiquity. The *Yuzi* states: *'He who abandons fame knows no sorrow.'* Laozi said: *'Fame is but the guest of reality.'* [Liu Xiaobiao notes:] This line does not appear in the current *Laozi* but is found in the *Zhuangzi*’s *Free and Easy Wandering* chapter. Yet the careless multitude ceaselessly pursue fame. If fame cannot be abandoned, can it truly be treated as a mere guest?\n\nNow, to have fame is to gain honor and glory; to lack fame is to suffer lowliness and disgrace. Honor and glory bring ease and joy; lowliness and disgrace bring sorrow and suffering. Sorrow and suffering violate one’s nature; ease and joy accord with it. These are the ties that bind reality. How can fame be abandoned? How can it be treated as a guest? The true evil lies in clinging to fame and thereby burdening reality.\"\n\n[Annotation:] *Wù* is pronounced *wùlù*. *Fú* is read as *fú*. *Lěi* is in the falling tone.\n\n\"Clinging to fame and thereby burdening reality will lead to concerns over peril and ruin that cannot be saved—how could it be merely a matter between ease and joy or sorrow and suffering?\"\n\nQin Enfu notes: From the passage beginning *\"Wei, the Viscount Duanmu Shu,\"* onward, Lu’s commentary is missing, and there is no way to supplement or correct it.\n\n*Liezi Jishi*, Volume Eight: *Shuofu* (Explaining Symbols)\n\n[Annotation:] Affairs are boundless, with fortune and misfortune mutually propelling one another. When words are spoken and verified, they are grasped within the convergence of change and adaptation.\n\n[Exegesis:] This chapter, departing from the *Mo Ming* edition, approximates form to discern spirit. Establishing affairs reveals the real; pursuing names seeks reality. Only then does one recognize the loss of the Dao in following emotions and the forfeiture of truth in indulging desires. Thus, those who know the Dao do not lose their timely self, and those who employ ability need not distance themselves from harm.\n\nQin Enfu notes: The character *\"zi\"* (自) in the exegesis is likely superfluous.\n\nMaster Liezi studied under Master Huqiu Zilin.\nMaster Huqiu Zilin said: \"If you understand *holding back*, then we may speak of *holding the self*.\"\n[Annotation:] Laozi said, *\"Hold back the self, and the self will advance.\"*\nLiezi said: \"I have heard of *holding back*.\"\nMaster Huqiu replied: \"Look at your shadow, and you will understand.\"\nLiezi turned and observed his shadow: when the body was bent, the shadow was crooked; when the body was straight, the shadow was upright. Thus, crookedness and straightness follow the body and do not reside in the shadow; bending and extending depend on the object and not on the self. This is called *holding back to occupy the forefront*.\"\n[Annotation:] No thing can contend with it, so it always occupies the forefront. These words, though Huzi’s answer, are not clearly expounded. Liezi grasped the meaning of *holding back* and thereby explained it himself, so Huzi did not further respond.\n[Exegesis:] The shadow arises from the form, and crookedness or straightness originates in the form’s movement. The form exists through the spirit, and authenticity or falsity lies in the spirit’s function. If one discerns the form by observing the shadow and knows the spirit by understanding the form—without demanding the shadow to rectify the body or clinging to the body to illuminate the Dao—then by observing the branch, one knows the root, and by examining the manifest, one perceives the subtle. Only then can one always occupy the forefront.\n\nThe *Daozang* edition and Yuan edition both read *\"seems Huzi’s answer\"* instead of *\"with Huzi’s answer.\"*\nBo Jun notes: The *Huainanzi*’s *Miu Cheng Xun* states: *\"Liezi studied under Huzi and, observing the reflection in a pillar, understood *holding back*.\"*\n\n[Phonetic Annotations:] *Zheng* (争) is pronounced *zhèng*. *Xie* (解) is pronounced *xiè*. *Fu* (复) is read *fú*.\n\nGuan Yin said to Master Liezi: \"Beautiful words produce a beautiful echo; foul words produce a foul echo. A long body casts a long shadow; a short body casts a short shadow. The name is the echo; the self is the shadow.\"\n[Annotation:] The retribution of good and evil is like echoes and shadows—there is no discrepancy in principle.\nTao Hongqing notes: The preceding line, *\"The name is the echo,\"* follows from *\"Beautiful words produce a beautiful echo; foul words produce a foul echo\"*—an echo arises from words, but words are not the echo. This line follows from *\"A long body casts a long shadow; a short body casts a short shadow\"*—a shadow arises from the body, but the body is not the shadow. Now, saying *\"the self is the shadow\"* is somewhat difficult to reconcile. Here, *\"self\"* refers to the body that receives retribution, entirely distinct in meaning from *\"long body\"* or *\"short body\"* above. The subsequent text—*\"Measure lies in the self; verification lies in others. If others love me, I must love them; if others hate me, I must hate them\"*—means that by observing others’ love or hatred toward me, one knows my own love or hatred toward others. Loving or hating others is the self; others loving or hating that self is the shadow. Thus, *\"the self is the shadow.\"*\nWang Shumin notes: *\"Self\"* (身) should be *\"conduct\"* (行). The following line, *\"Be cautious in your conduct, for it will be followed,\"* directly continues this idea. The current text’s *\"self\"* is an error, arising from the preceding *\"long body\"* and *\"short body.\"* The *Shizi*, as cited in the *Taiping Yulan* (430), reads *\"conduct is the shadow,\"* providing collateral evidence.\nBo Jun notes: Wang’s proposal is tenable; Tao’s interpretation, though ingenious, is overly circuitous.\n\nThus it is said: Be cautious in your words, for they will be harmonized; be cautious in your conduct, for it will be followed.\n[Annotation:] As the saying goes: *\"Speak good words, and a thousand *li* away they will respond; act nearby, and it will be seen afar.\"*\nJiang Yougao notes: *\"He\"* (和) and *\"sui\"* (随) rhyme, both belonging to the ancient *ge* rhyme group.\n[Phonetic Annotations:] *Jian* (见) is pronounced *xiàn*.\n\nTherefore, the sage observes the outgoing to know the incoming, examines the past to know the future—this is the principle by which they possess foreknowledge.\n[Annotation:] Seeing words go out and echoes return, forms depart and shadows arrive, one understands that the principle of retribution is no different. Yet things have not yet awakened to this, so it is called *\"foreknowledge.\"*\n[Exegesis:] The echo follows the sound; if the sound is good, the echo is beautiful. The name follows reality; if reality is good, the name is true. Thus, the name is the echo of the sound, and the self is the shadow of the spirit. Sounds emit and echoes harmonize; conduct is practiced and the spirit follows. Therefore, the sage hears the echo to know the sound and sees conduct to know the Dao.\n\nThe measure lies in the self; verification lies in others. If others love me, I must love them; if others hate me, I must hate them.\n[Annotation:] Ritual measure lies in the self; verification lies with others. Love and hatred follow accordingly—things do not betray the self.\nTang and Wu loved the world, thus they reigned.\n\n\"Wang\" is pronounced *yù* (于放切). Jie and Zhou hated the world, thus they perished.\n[Annotation:] This is the verification of the principle. This is what is meant by *\"verification.\"*\n\n[Exegesis:] Ritual measure lies in the self; verification lies in others—like the shadow responding to the form, the echo answering the sound. The traces of Tang, Wu, Jie, and Zhou may be examined; their measures may be made clear. One must be cautious in matters of love and hatred. If both verification and measure are clear yet the Dao is not followed, it is like going out without using the door or walking without following the path.\n[Annotation:] When the principles of verification and measure are already clear, yet the Dao is still not practiced, it is like exiting without passing through the gate or walking without following the path. (The character *jìng* [径] appears in one version as *qú* [衢], and in another as *shù* [术]. *Fù* [复] is pronounced *fú* [扶又切].) To seek profit by such means—is it not difficult?\n[Annotation:] There has never been profit gained by violating principle.\n\n[Exegesis:] If the matters of verification and measure are clear yet the Dao is not followed, it is like walking without using the gate or the thoroughfare. To seek profit for oneself in the world by such means—is it not difficult? (Qin Enfu notes: According to the exegesis, the Lu edition reads *qú* [衢] instead of *jìng* [径].)\n\nI have observed the virtue of Shennong and Yan, examined the books of Yu, Xia, Shang, and Zhou, and measured them against the words of learned scholars and worthies. There has never been a case of survival or ruin, rise or fall that did not proceed from this Dao.\n[Annotation:] From ancient times to the present, there has been no instance without verification.\n\n[Exegesis:] By examining their conduct and verifying their traces, the words of ancient sage-kings and worthies remain consistent with those of others. Survival and ruin, rise and fall are all clearly evident. There has never been a case of governance not proceeding from this Dao.\n\nYan Hui said: \"Those who ask about the Dao do so to become wealthy.\n[Annotation:] *Ask* here means *to learn.* (*Wèi* [为] is pronounced *wéi* [于伪切].) Now that I have obtained a pearl, I am wealthy—what need is there for the Dao?\"\n[Annotation:] The Dao is the root of wealth; the pearl is its branch. When the root exists, the branch remains; to preserve the branch is to lose the root. (The Northern Song edition omits the character *yě* [也] after *\"wealth’s branch,\"* and Wang’s edition follows this. Here, it is restored according to the *Four Exegeses* edition.)\n\nMaster Liezi said: \"Jie and Zhou valued profit and slighted the Dao, thus they perished.\n[Annotation:] They were not without wealth, but by losing the root, they lost themselves. How fortunate that I have not yet spoken to you of this! A person without righteousness eats and nothing more—\n[Annotation:] *Righteousness* means *what is fitting.* One who attains the fitting principle of reason cannot be deprived by external things. Such a person is no better than a chicken or a dog. Forcibly seizing food and butting heads—\n(Yu Yue says: *Mǐ* [靡] should be read as *mó* [摩]. In the *Mati* chapter of the *Zhuangzi*, it says, *\"When pleased, they rub necks together.\"* The exegesis by Li cites *mó* [摩], showing that *mǐ* [靡] and *mó* [摩] share the same meaning. Thus, *mǐ jiǎo* [靡角] means *rubbing horns together.* Wang Shumin says: Yu’s interpretation is correct. The *Taiping Yulan* [421] quotes it as *mó* [磨]. *Mó* [磨], *mó* [摩], and *mǐ* [靡] were interchangeable in ancient usage. *Mǐ* [靡] is pronounced *wén bǐ* [文彼切]. The *Han Shi Waizhuan* says: *Mǐ* [靡] means *together.* The *Lüshi Chunqiu* says: *Jiǎo* [角] means *to test strength.* This passage describes those who value profit and slight the Dao, eating and nothing more—like birds and beasts that eat their fill and then butt heads together to compete for dominance.) The victor gains control—such are birds and beasts.\n[Annotation:] To seek victory by force is not the human Dao. (Wang Chongmin says: The character *zhì* [制] is semantically incoherent here and should be *lì* [利], a scribal error. The *Taiping Yulan* [421] quotes it as *\"the victor gains profit,\"* which confirms this.) To be no better than chickens, dogs, birds, or beasts yet desire others’ respect—this cannot be attained.\n[Annotation:] How could one desire others’ respect? When the Dao is present, one is naturally respected. If others do not respect you, danger and disgrace will befall you.\n[Annotation:] To be willingly esteemed without resentment is what it means to be respected. If one violates this principle, ruin will follow.\n\n[Exegesis:] *Wealth* means *without lack*—it does not refer to the wealth of profit-seeking. To value profit and slight the Dao is how Jie and Zhou perished. Chickens, dogs, birds, and beasts know nothing of benevolence and righteousness; they fight over food and rely on strength, unaware of anything else. To act thus is to invite danger and disgrace upon oneself. How could one then expect others’ respect? This is what is meant by *seeking reality through names.*\n\nLiezi had hit the target in archery.\n[Annotation:] He had hit it by chance, not through deliberate aim. (*Zhòng* [中] is pronounced *dīng zhòng* [丁仲切] below.)\nHe asked Master Guan Yin about it. Master Yin said:\n(Wang Chongmin says: The *Taiping Yulan* [745] includes an additional *guān* [关] here, which is correct. Ancient texts sometimes refer to him as *Guan Yin* but never as *Yinzi* below. Wang Shumin says: Wang’s interpretation is correct. The *Lüshi Chunqiu*’s *Shen Ji* chapter also reads *\"Master Guan Yin said\"* below.)\n\"Do you know why you hit the target?\"\nHe replied: \"I do not.\"\nMaster Guan Yin said: \"Not yet.\"\n[Annotation:] Though he had hit the target, he did not know how, so it was said to be \"not yet.\"\nHe withdrew and practiced. After three years, he returned to report to Master Guan Yin. The Master said: \"Do you know why you hit the target?\"\nLiezi said: \"I know now.\"\nMaster Guan Yin said: \"It is acceptable. Hold to this and do not lose it.\n[Annotation:] With a calm mind and upright body, seeking within oneself, one attains the Dao of hitting the target. Then, one may aim at the target in advance, and every shot will strike without fail. This is not only true of archery—governing a state and cultivating the self are the same.\"\n\nThus, the sage does not examine whether something endures or perishes but examines the reason it is so.\n\nThough one may hit the target without knowing how, this is not the Dao of hitting the target; though one may endure without knowing why, this is not the principle of endurance. Therefore, in archery, the unskilled and the skilled may both hit the mark, yet those who know *why* they hit it differ. The worthy and the foolish may both endure, yet those who know *why* they endure are distinct.\n\nOne who does not know *why* they hit the target is not the most excellent of the excellent. To grasp it with the hand and respond with the heart, to command the shot and strike the mark—this is attainment. To attain and hold to it is called the Dao. One who knows this Dao may apply it not only to archery but also to governing a state and cultivating the self.\n\nThe master of archery does not value merely hitting the target but values the reason it *must* be hit. Likewise, the master of ordering a state or cultivating the self does not value mere endurance but values the reason it *must* endure. Thus, whether the worthy or the foolish, order or chaos, may be known—this is the presence of the Dao.\n\nLiezi said: \"Those whose appearance is flourishing are arrogant; those whose strength is flourishing are aggressive—they cannot yet be spoken to of the Dao. Only when their hair is streaked with white may one speak to them of it, lest they lose it. How much less can they practice it?\n\nThose who are arrogant and aggressive allow no one to instruct them. With no one to instruct them, they become isolated and lack support. The worthy, however, employ others, and so even in old age they do not decline; even when their wisdom is exhausted, they do not fall into chaos.\n\nThus, the difficulty in governing a state lies not in being worthy oneself but in recognizing worth in others. One who deems themselves worthy is, as stated above, isolated and without support. But one who recognizes worth allows the wise to counsel them and the capable to serve them. With no talent wasted, the state is easily ordered.\"\n\nThe common people rely on appearance and strength. Those who rely on appearance foster arrogance and indolence; those who rely on strength harbor aggressive and combative intentions—they cannot be spoken to of the Dao. Only when their appearance and strength have faded, when their hair is streaked with white, may one speak to them of it. Yet even then, though they may hear the Dao in old age, they cannot attain it—how much less can they practice it? Thus, those who abide in humility and weakness are embraced by the Dao, while those who are self-assertive and aggressive find no one willing to instruct them. With no one willing to instruct them, how can they have support?\n\nThe worthy entrust themselves to others, and so their spirit does not wane with age, nor does their mind fall into chaos when their wisdom is spent. One who governs a state in this way, recognizing worth and employing it, allows worthy talent to serve them. But one who deems themselves worthy and lacks support loses others.\n\nThere was once a man of Song who, for his lord, crafted mulberry leaves from jade.\n\nAfter three years, it was completed. Its edges and stems, whether full or slender, its fine veins and lush sheen—when mixed among real mulberry leaves, none could distinguish them. Thus, this man came to feed himself by his skill throughout the state of Song.\n\nMaster Liezi heard of this and said: \"If heaven and earth took three years to produce a single leaf, then things with leaves would be few indeed. Therefore, the sage relies on the transformative power of the Dao and not on clever skill.\"\n\n[Annotation] This shows that relying on skill is insufficient to sustain things; following the Dao in transformation leaves nothing unfulfilled.\n\n[Exegesis] Carving and polishing to return to simplicity is the Way of restoring purity. Thus it is said: the master binder needs no glue or lacquer; the master locker needs no bolt or key. Therefore, great eloquence seems inarticulate, and great skill seems clumsy. If three years’ labor produces a single leaf indistinguishable from a real one, how can this be the skill of governing a state or preserving the Dao? Thus, the sage relies on the transformative power of the Dao—just as harmonious qi spreads and all things come to life—rather than on clever skill. To defy the principles of heaven and produce artificial craft is to fail to understand root and branch.\n\n[Note] \"Skill\" in some editions reads \"merit\" or \"ability.\" \"Sustain things\" in the Northern Song edition appears as \"marry things,\" where \"marry\" is likely a scribal error.\n\nMaster Liezi was poor, his face bearing the pallor of hunger. A guest spoke of this to Zi Yang of Zheng, saying: \"Lie Yukou is surely a man of the Dao, yet he dwells in your state and suffers poverty—does this not suggest the lord does not love men of worth?\" Zi Yang of Zheng immediately ordered an official to send him grain. Master Liezi went out to meet the messenger, bowed twice, and declined. The messenger departed. When Master Liezi returned inside, his wife struck her breast and said: \"I have heard that the wife and children of a man of the Dao all enjoy ease and happiness. Now you bear the look of hunger, and the lord, passing by, sent you food. You refused it—is this not fate?\" Master Liezi laughed and said to her: \"The lord does not know me himself.\"\n\nMaster Liezi said: \"He sent me grain on the words of another; should he blame me, it would likewise be on the words of another—this is why I did not accept it.\"\n\nBo Jun notes: The *Xin Xu*’s \"Jie Shi\" chapter contains the lines: \"Moreover, to accept another’s sustenance and not die for their peril is unrighteous; to die for their peril is to die for an unprincipled man—how can that be righteous?\"\n\nIn the end, the people indeed rose in revolt and killed Zi Yang.\n\n[Commentary] To eat another’s provisions is to share their concerns. The lord did not know me himself but bestowed grain upon me based on another’s words; if he were to blame me, it would likewise be based on another’s words. What I value is the one who truly knows me—a man who has awakened to the Dao. When Zi Yang’s calamity arose, I was not harmed—this is what it truly means not to be burdened or harmed by external things.\n\nBo Jun notes: The *Records of the Grand Historian*’s \"Hereditary House of Zheng\" states: \"In the twenty-fifth year of Duke Xu, the lord of Zheng killed his minister Zi Yang.\" The *Lüshi Chunqiu*’s \"Shi Wei\" chapter says: \"Zi Yang favored severity; one who erred and broke his bow feared he would surely die, so he incited mad dogs to assassinate Zi Yang.\"\n\nThe Lu family of the Shi clan had two sons: one fond of learning, the other fond of military arts. The one fond of learning offered his arts to the Marquis of Qi; the Marquis accepted him and made him tutor to the various princes. The one fond of military arts went to Chu and offered his methods to the King of Chu; the King was pleased and made him military commander. Their salaries enriched their household, and their ranks honored their kin.\n\nThe neighboring Meng family had two sons as well, who pursued the same studies, yet they were distressed by poverty. Envying the Shi family’s prosperity, they asked for the path to advancement. The two sons told the Meng family the truth. One of the Meng sons went to Qin and offered his arts to the King of Qin. The King of Qin said: \"Now the feudal lords contend with force, and what they pursue is nothing but arms and provisions. If I were to govern my state with benevolence and righteousness, it would be the way to ruin.\"\n\nThus, the King of Qin imprisoned and exiled the Meng son. The other son went to Wei and offered his methods to the Marquis of Wei. The Marquis said: \"My state is weak, hemmed in between great powers. I serve the great states and soothe the small ones—this is the Way to seek security. Were I to rely on military power, destruction would soon follow. If I were to let you return intact and you went to another state, the harm you could bring me would be no small matter.\" He then had the Meng son’s feet cut off and sent him back to Lu.\n\nUpon their return, the father and son of the Meng family beat their chests and reproached the Shi family. The Shi family said: \"In all things, those who seize the moment prosper, while those who miss it perish. Your Way was the same as ours, yet your success differed—this was a matter of missing the moment, not of flawed conduct. Moreover, in the world, principles have no constant right, and affairs no constant wrong. What was used before may now be discarded; what is discarded today may later be employed. In this, use and disuse have no fixed right or wrong. Seizing opportunities and meeting the moment, responding to affairs without fixed method—this depends on wisdom. Though one may possess the arts of benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and law, without wisdom suited to the time, one acts and misses the moment. If wisdom is insufficient, even were one as learned as Confucius or as skilled as Lü Shang, where could one go and not meet with failure?\" The Meng father and son, their resentment dissolved, said: \"We understand. Say no more!\"\n\nTo study the Dao of benevolence and righteousness, to master the arts of strategy and planning—though civil and martial differ, both converge in the application of talent and conduct, which must rely on wisdom suited to the moment. Wisdom is the application of the Dao; to rely solely on wisdom is to depart from the Dao.\n\nTo strike is to hit the gap; to act is to meet the moment. Responding to change without fixed method—all this is wisdom. Thus, one who adapts to the time is never at a loss for talent; one who illuminates the Dao is never lacking in wisdom. If wisdom is insufficient, though one’s civil arts match Confucius or martial skill match Lü Shang, one cannot escape hardship.\n\nThe Meng father and son, having awakened, said only, “Say no more.”\n\nWhen Duke Wen of Jin went forth to meet the lords, intending to attack Wei, Prince Chu looked up to the sky and laughed. The Prime Minister asked, “Why do you laugh?” He replied, “I laugh at my neighbor, who was escorting his wife back to her family when, on the road, he saw a woman gathering mulberry leaves. Enamored, he spoke to her, yet when he turned to look at his wife, another was beckoning to her as well. I laugh at this.”\n\nThe Duke grasped his meaning and called off the attack.\n\nWang Chongmin notes: In the *Leiju* (ch. 88) and *Taiping Yulan* (ch. 305 and 457), the character \"寤\" is uniformly written as \"悟.\" The *Shiwen* glosses: \"寤 is pronounced as 悟.\" The army was withdrawn, yet before it returned, raiders had already struck its northern border.\n\n**[Annotation]** What I have done, others may also do. To indulge one’s own ambitions while assuming others will not harbor the same intentions is to be deluded by the distinction between self and other.\n\n**[Exegesis]** To covet gain without understanding that gain must be guarded is the common folly of the vulgar. Thus, desires know no bounds, and the true Dao daily wanes. The value of one who knows the Dao lies in inwardly preserving the Dao without loss and outwardly applying it to things without omission. The worldly, however, are not so: outwardly, they lust after other women, enamored of another’s wife; inwardly, they lose the Dao, and their own wife is beckoned by another.\n\nQin Enfu remarks: In the exegesis, the character \"得\" in \"得有所守\" is likely a superfluous interpolation.\n\nThe state of Jin suffered from rampant banditry. There was a man named Xi Yong—Lu Jun notes: \"郄\" should be written as \"郤.\" The *Shuowen* states, \"郤 was the fief of Shu Hu, a grandee of Jin.\" Duan Yucai’s commentary adds: \"Shu Hu’s son was named Xi Rui, who took his fief as his surname.\" The *Qunshu Zhiyao* correctly writes it as \"郤,\" and the same should apply below. Shao Ying’s *Qunjing Zhengzi* observes: \"The vulgar further corrupt it to '郄,' a variant of '郤.' In the *Hanxue Shichao* by Song En et al., the character '师' appears as '□□,' with a component resembling '卩,' leading the vulgar to alter it to '郄.' The * Yupian* notes: '郄 is a vulgar form of 卩.'\" The *Shiwen* glosses: \"郄 is pronounced *qì* (去逆切). 雍 is pronounced *yōng* (邕).\" Xi Yong could discern a bandit’s appearance—\"貌\" originally read \"眼,\" but the present version follows the *Jifu* and *Shidetang* editions, which correct it to \"貌.\" The *Taiping Yulan* (ch. 499) also writes it as \"貌.\" The *Shiwen* notes: \"貌 appears in one edition as 眼.\"—and examine the space between their brows and lashes to uncover their true nature. The *Shiwen* glosses: \"睫 is pronounced *jié* (接).\" The Marquis of Jin sent him to identify bandits, and among thousands, not one escaped his detection.\n\nThe Marquis of Jin rejoiced greatly and told Zhao Wenzi: \"I have found one man, and the bandits of the entire state are as good as eradicated. Lu Jun notes: The *Taiping Yulan* (ch. 499) includes a \"之\" after \"为.\" The *Shiwen* glosses: \"为 is pronounced *wěi* (于伪切). Why should I employ many?\" Wenzi replied: \"My lord relies on surveillance to catch bandits, yet bandits will not be eradicated. Moreover, Xi Yong will surely not meet a natural death.\" Soon after, the bandits plotted among themselves: \"The one who has cornered us is Xi Yong.\" Wang Chongmin notes: The *Taiping Yulan* (ch. 499) includes a \"以\" after \"所,\" which is correct. They then joined forces to murder him.\n\n**[Annotation]** \"残\" means to kill or destroy. Wang Chongmin notes: The *Qunshu Zhiyao* and *Taiping Yulan* (ch. 499) write \"残\" as \"戕,\" and the latter may be closer to the original. The *Shuowen* defines \"戕\" as \"a minister from another state who assassinates a ruler,\" hence Zhang’s annotation reads \"to kill treacherously.\" The *Shiwen* writes \"残\" as \"戕,\" glossing: \"戕 is pronounced *qiāng* (墙), as in the annotation; one edition writes it as 残.\"\n\nThe Marquis of Jin, upon hearing this, was greatly alarmed. The *Shiwen* writes \"骇\" as \"駴,\" noting: \"It is the same as 骇.\" He immediately summoned Wenzi and said: \"As you predicted, Xi Yong is dead! But what method should we use to capture the bandits?\" The *Qinke Lu* edition omits the character \"盗.\" Wenzi replied: \"There is a Zhou proverb that says: 'One who sees the fish in the depths is inauspicious; one who predicts hidden things brings calamity.' Jiang Yougao notes: \"祥 and 殃 form a rhyme, both belonging to the ancient *yang* rhyme group.\" Lu Jun notes: The *Hanfeizi* (*Shuo Lin Shang*) states: \"An ancient proverb says, 'One who knows the fish in the depths is inauspicious.'\" The *Shiwen* glosses: \"料 is pronounced in the falling tone (去声). Moreover, if my lord wishes to eliminate banditry, you must elevate the worthy and employ them. Let instruction be clear above, and transformation flow below; if the people have a sense of shame, what banditry will there be?\"\n\n**[Annotation]** This answers the method to stop banditry.\n\nThereupon, they appointed Sui Hui to oversee governance, and the bandits fled to Qin.\n\n**[Annotation]** To employ keen discernment in judging right and wrong is to invite the flight of the deceitful; to use foresight in exposing hidden evils is to incur the hatred of the wicked. Is the peril of wisdom mere empty talk?\n\n**[Exegesis]** Instruction is the outward form, the path by which the multitude walks. Transformation is the Dao, the principle by which the multitude daily lives and inwardly submits. When the heart submits, shame arises; when the outward form is clear, instruction is achieved. Elevate the worthy and employ the capable, and bandits will flee. Someone asked: Zhuangzi said, \"When the sage is born, great bandits arise.\" Yet here it says that elevating the worthy and employing the capable causes bandits to depart. How can this be? The answer: To seek empty fame while losing substance is to give rise to great bandits; to attain substance while forsaking fame is to cause bandits to depart. Thus, elevating the worthy and employing the capable is the pursuit of fame; employing Sui Hui is the attainment of substance. The principles do not contradict each other—what doubt can there be? The *Qunshu Zhiyao* writes \"先\" as \"少\" in the annotation \"用先识,\" which is closer to the original. The *Shiwen* glosses: \"擿 is pronounced *zhí* (陟革切).\"\n\nConfucius, returning from Wei to Lu, halted his carriage at the bridge over the Yellow River and gazed upon it.\n\nA cataract plunges three hundred feet—*Shide Hall*’s edition mistakenly writes \"thirty.\" Its whirling currents span ninety *li*. Fish and soft-shelled turtles cannot swim there; *yuan*-turtles and alligators cannot dwell there. Yet a man was just about to ford it. The *Qunshu Zhiyao* omits the word \"a.\" *Shiwen* notes: *厉* means \"to wade through water.\" Confucius sent someone along the bank to stop him—the *Qunshu Zhiyao* omits the words \"along the bank.\" *Shiwen* notes: *并* is pronounced *páng*; *涯* sounds like *yá*. \"This cataract plunges three hundred feet; its whirling currents span ninety *li*. Fish and soft-shelled turtles cannot swim there; *yuan*-turtles and alligators cannot dwell there. Do you think it can be crossed?\" The *Qunshu Zhiyao* omits the words \"cannot swim.\" The man did not alter his resolve—the *Qunshu Zhiyao* writes *措* for *错*. *Shiwen* notes: *错* is pronounced *cù*. He then crossed and emerged.\n\nConfucius asked him, \"Are you skillful? Do you possess a Daoist technique?\" Wang Shumin notes: The *Jia Yu*’s *Zhisi* chapter and the *Shuo Yuan*’s *Zayan* chapter both add the word \"you\" before \"skillful,\" making the phrasing more complete; this should be followed. This text’s *Huangdi* chapter reads, \"Are you skillful? Do you possess the Way?\" The *Zhuangzi*’s *Zhi Beiyou* chapter reads, \"Are you skillful? Do you possess the Dao?\" Both follow the same pattern. \"How is it that you were able to enter and emerge?\" The man replied, \"When I first entered, I relied on loyalty and trust. When I emerged, I again followed loyalty and trust. Loyalty and trust placed my body amidst the waves, and I dared not act on private motives—the *Qunshu Zhiyao* writes *措* for *错*. Yu Yue notes: The phrase \"loyalty and trust placed my body amidst the waves\" contains a superfluous \"loyalty and trust,\" likely borrowed from the preceding sentence. Wang Shumin notes: Yu Yue’s observation is correct. The *Qunshu Zhiyao* indeed omits the words \"loyalty and trust.\" \"Thus I was able to enter and emerge—this is how.\"\n\nConfucius said to his disciples, \"Remember this, all of you!\" *Shiwen* notes: *识* is pronounced *zhì*. \"If even water can be approached with loyalty, trust, and sincerity, how much more so can people?\" The annotation notes: This passage appears in the *Huangdi* chapter with minor differences, but its meaning is not distinct, so its meaning is not re-explained here. The explanation states: Loyalty harmonizes with all things; trust leaves no room for doubt. Harmonizing without doubt and refraining from private motives—this is how one enters and emerges. Thus, to harmonize without doubt and refrain from private motives is to grasp the Dao! This passage also appears in the *Huangdi* chapter. Bo Jun notes: This passage centers on the two words \"loyalty\" and \"trust\"; the words \"and sincerity\" may be superfluous. The *Qunshu Zhiyao* omits the words \"and sincerity,\" confirming this. *Shiwen* notes: *复* is pronounced *fù*.\n\nLord Bai asked Confucius, \"Can one speak with you in secret?\" Wang Chongmin notes: The *Lüshi Chunqiu*’s *Jingyu* chapter, the *Huainanzi*’s *Daoying* chapter, and the *Taiping Yulan* (chapter 58) all include the word \"to\" after \"asked\"—the current text is missing it due to a scribal error. Confucius did not respond. The annotation notes: Lord Bai was the grandson of King Ping of Chu and the son of Crown Prince Jian. His father was slandered by Fei Wuji and fled to Zheng, where the Zheng people killed him. Bai wished to have ministers Zixi and Ziqing attack Zheng, but though they agreed, they did not act. When Jin attacked Zheng, Zixi and Ziqing prepared to aid Zheng. Bai grew angry, saying, \"The Zheng people are here—our enemies are not far off!\" He wished to kill Zixi and Ziqing, so he questioned Confucius. Confucius, knowing his intent, did not respond. *微言* means \"secret plans.\" The explanation states: *微言* refers to secret speech, which others cannot know. Lord Bai was the grandson of King Ping of Chu and the son of Crown Prince Jian. When Jian fled to Zheng, Lord Bai sought to cause chaos, so Confucius did not respond.\n\nLu Wenchao states: The annotation reads \"Bai wished to have ministers Zixi and Ziqing attack Zheng,\" but the *Zangben* edition has \"報\" (*revenge*) instead of \"欲\" (*wish*). Bo Jun notes: The version with \"報\" is incorrect. The *Records of the Grand Historian: House of Chu* states, \"Lord Bai harbored this resentment toward Zheng and wished to attack it,\" which proves that \"欲\" is not in error. Lüshi Chunqiu’s *Jingyu* chapter, in Gao You’s annotation, reads: \"Bai, together with his uncle the Prime Minister Zixi and the Marshal Ziqing, attacked Zheng, agreeing but not acting.\" Here, \"與\" (*together with*) should also be \"欲\" (*wished to*). Zhang’s annotation frequently cites Gao’s, and this note is also an abridgment of Gao’s text.\n\nThe *Shiwen* reads \"報令\" instead of \"欲令,\" and notes: *Fei* is pronounced *fangwei*; *Sheng* (Bai’s given name) is pronounced *shizheng*; *ling* is pronounced *langding*.\n\nLord Bai asked, \"If one casts a stone into water, what then?\" Wang Shumin states: The character \"問\" (*asked*) is superfluous, having been carried over from the earlier passage \"Lord Bai asked Confucius.\" The *Shilei Fu* (Chapter 7), *Taiping Yulan* (Chapter 58), *Jizuan Yuanhai* (Chapter 1), and *Tianzhong Ji* (Chapter 9) all omit the character \"問.\" The *Lüshi Chunqiu*’s *Jingyu* chapter and the *Huainanzi*’s *Daoying* chapter likewise omit it.\n\nConfucius said, \"A skilled diver from Wu could retrieve it.\" The annotation explains: A stone cast into water sinks, just as subtle speech cannot be perceived. Thus, Confucius answered that only a skilled diver could retrieve it, illustrating that nothing can remain hidden.\n\nLu Wenchao states: In the *Zangben* annotation, the character \"人\" (*person*) appears after \"言\" (*speech*), and \"不可覺\" (*cannot be perceived*) is written as \"不能覺\" (*unable to perceive*).\n\nLord Bai asked, \"If one pours water into water, what then?\" Confucius said, \"When the waters of the Zi and the Meng rivers mingle, Yi Ya could distinguish them by taste.\" The annotation explains: Even a master of flavors could tell them apart. The *Jie* states: Casting a stone into water is like traces that cannot be seen; pouring water into water is like blending that cannot be concealed. Flavors, once distinct like the Zi and Meng rivers, cannot be merged—only through profound resonance with principle can one grasp them.\n\nThe *Shiwen* notes: *Zi* is pronounced *ceqi*; *Meng* is pronounced *cheng*; *fu* is pronounced *fuyou*; *bie* is pronounced *bili*.\n\nLord Bai said, \"Is it truly impossible to share subtle speech with others?\" The Northern Song edition, Wang’s edition, and the *Sijie* edition read \"故\" (*therefore*) instead of \"固\" (*truly*). Wang Chongmin states: The *Daozang* unannotated edition, *Jifu* edition, *Huainanzi*’s *Daoying* chapter, and *Taiping Yulan* (Chapter 58) all have \"固\" instead of \"故.\" Bo Jun notes: \"固\" is correct; the text has been emended accordingly.\n\nConfucius said, \"Why would it be impossible? Only one who knows the meaning of speech can do so.\" The annotation explains: *Wei* (*meaning*) refers to the intent behind speech. The intent behind speech is precisely its subtlety. When manifested in action, nothing remains hidden. The *Shiwen* notes: *Qu* is pronounced *qu*.\n\n\"One who knows the meaning of speech does not speak through words.\" The annotation explains: To speak through words is to lack subtlety or concealment. The *Jie* states: Emotions arise and affairs become evident; flavors differ yet can be tasted—only the boundless spirit can grasp them. One who knows the meaning of speech achieves spiritual resonance. Those who fight over fish get wet; those who chase beasts run—not because they delight in it. The annotation explains: It is the natural course of events that they get wet or run. Bo Jun notes: The *Lüshi Chunqiu*’s *Junan* chapter states, \"Those who rescue the drowning get wet; those who pursue fugitives run.\" The *Shiwen* notes: *Le* is pronounced *luo*.\n\n\"Thus, the highest speech transcends words.\" The annotation explains: Principles become clear of themselves; transformation proceeds on its own. The *Shiwen* notes: *Qu* is pronounced *qulv*.\n\n\"The highest action is non-action.\" The annotation explains: Principles fulfill themselves; things follow of their own accord. \"What shallow minds contend over is trivial.\" The annotation explains: Clinging to the superficial while losing the root, they only resolve disputes after matters become evident—rarely do they avoid failure. The *Jie* states: Fish belong in water; those who fight over them get wet. Beasts run in the wild; those who chase them run—not because they delight in it, but because circumstances compel them. Thus, the highest speech does not reside in words, and the highest action requires no doing. Shallow minds pursue trivialities and constantly lose sight of principle. Where the Dao is enacted, all things find their proper place. The *Shiwen* notes: *Zhi* is pronounced *zhi*; *xian* is pronounced *xianqian*.\n\nLord Bai, unable to restrain himself, died in the bathhouse. The annotation explains: Not understanding the meaning of speech, he proceeded to create chaos and thus met with disaster. The *Jie* states: Acting in blind fury without regard for principle, he died to satisfy his impulses—this is how the foolish disrupt order. Yu Yue states: The character \"已\" (*already*) is an error for \"也\" (*indeed*). The *Huainanzi*’s *Daoying* chapter reads \"白公不得也\" (*Lord Bai did not attain it*), and the *Lüshi Chunqiu*’s *Jingyu* chapter reads \"白公弗得也\" (*Lord Bai could not attain it*), both serving as evidence. Zhang’s annotation, \"Not understanding the meaning of speech, he proceeded to create chaos and thus met with disaster,\" precisely explains the meaning of \"不得\" (*did not attain*). The *Shiwen* notes: *Nan* is pronounced *nandan*.\n\nViscount Xiang of Zhao sent Xin Zhi Muzi to attack the Di. The annotation explains: Muzi was Xin Zhi Gou, a household minister of Viscount Xiang. The Di were the Xianyu. Bo Jun notes: This event is also recorded in the *Guoyu* (Chapter 9), the *Lüshi Chunqiu*’s *Shenda* chapter, and the *Huainanzi*’s *Daoying* chapter. The *Shiwen* notes: Muzi was Xin Zhi Gou, a grandee of Jin. *Di* is pronounced *di*.\n\nHe was victorious, and the *Shiwen* treats this as a complete sentence. He captured the people of Zuoren and Zhongren. The annotation explains: Zuoren and Zhongren were two towns of the Xianyu. He sent a courier to announce the victory. The annotation explains: *Ju* means *transmit*; *ye* means *announce*. The *Jie* states: He hurried to announce the triumph. The *Shide Tang* edition omits the character \"來\" (*come*). The *Shiwen* notes: *Ju* is pronounced *ju*; *chuan* is the departing tone.\n\nViscount Xiang was eating when his countenance turned anxious. His attendants said, \"In a single morning, two cities have fallen—this is cause for joy among men. Yet why does my lord wear such a troubled expression?\"\n\nViscount Xiang replied, \"The greatness of the Yangtze and Yellow River lasts no more than three days,\"—referring to the ebb and flow of their tides. \"A whirlwind or torrential rain does not endure the whole morning. The *Shiwen* notes: *piao* is pronounced *fuxiao*. The sun at its zenith does not tarry for even a moment,\"—for that which waxes to its fullest must wane. Bo Jun notes: The *Lüshi Chunqiu* and *Huainanzi* both omit the phrase \"does not endure the whole morning.\" Liang Lvsheng said: The *Daodejing* states, \"A whirlwind does not last the morning; a sudden rain does not last the day\"—this is the source of Viscount Xiang’s meaning.\n\n\"Now, the virtue and conduct of the Zhao clan have not been cultivated through accumulation. Without accumulated virtue yet achieving such weighty success, one cannot but be wary. Yu Yue said: The character *shi* (*施*) is superfluous, likely a duplication of the character *yu* (*于*). The *Lüshi Chunqiu*’s *Shenda* chapter also contains this passage, and it indeed lacks the character *shi*. Wang Chongmin said: Yu Yue’s observation is correct. The *Huainanzi*’s *Daoying* chapter likewise omits *shi*. The *Shiwen* notes: *xing* is pronounced *xiameng*.\n\n\"In a single morning, two cities have fallen—how can ruin not overtake us?\"—for he who does not forget ruin will not perish. The annotation explains: Unable to accumulate virtue and deeds, yet by sheer force seizing two cities—when things reach their zenith, they must decline. What awaits but ruin? Thus, the wise do not rejoice in greed, for they know the peril of fleeting gain. Only then can one truly cultivate virtue.\n\nConfucius, hearing of this, said, \"The Zhao clan shall flourish! For anxiety is the very means by which they shall prosper\"—such deep caution. \"Joy is the very means by which they shall perish\"—for it leads to arrogance and boasting. Victory is not the difficult part; preserving it is the true challenge. Bo Jun notes: Gao You’s commentary on the *Lüshi Chunqiu* states: *chi* (*持*) means *to preserve*.\n\n\"The worthy ruler preserves victory by this means, and thus his blessings extend to later generations. The states of Qi, Chu, Wu, and Yue all once achieved victory, yet in the end met their ruin. Liang Qichao said: From this passage, it is evident that this text must contain later interpolations. *Liezi* and Zheng Siyang were contemporaries, yet though Wu and Yue had already fallen, Qi and Chu still existed. The record of Chu’s fall, even if not after the twenty-fourth year of Qin Shi Huang, must have occurred after Yue Yi entered Linzi and Bai Qi entered Ying.\n\n\"They failed to grasp how to preserve victory. Only a ruler who embodies the Way can truly preserve it.\"—for all who conquer their rivals are but peer states, and those who cannot preserve victory bring peril and ruin upon themselves.\n\nThe annotation explains: Pride in merit and boasting of ability lead to ruin; anxiety over gain and caution against strength lead to prosperity. The worthy ensure blessings for later generations by this means, and those who follow the Way extend their beneficence to all living beings—this is what it means to preserve victory. To preserve victory is to uphold this caution and vigilance against the arrogance of strength, a path only the man of the Way can tread.\n\nConfucius possessed such strength that he could lift the crossbar of a city gate, yet he refused to be known for his power. The annotation explains: *Jin* means *strength*; *tuo* means *to lift*. Though Confucius could raise the gate’s crossbar, he did not allow his strength to be renowned, for he did not employ it. Sun Yirang said: The *Zuozhuan* (Duke Xiang, Year 10) records: \"The people of Biyang opened the gate, and the officers of the feudal lords entered. The gate’s counterweight was released, but Liao Ren of Ju wrenched it open to let them out.\" It is likely that later traditions conflated the deeds of a Zou grandee with those of Confucius. Hu Huaichen said: Many texts, including the *Lüshi Chunqiu*’s *Shenda* chapter, the *Huainanzi*’s *Daoying* chapter, the *Yanshi Jiaxun*’s *Jiebing* chapter, and the *Shitong*’s *Yashuo* section, all attribute this feat to Confucius. Most collators have not disputed this, though Bi Yuan, in his commentary on the *Lüshi Chunqiu*, once questioned it. Was this because in those times, Confucius the Younger was also commonly called Confucius? Or was it due to repeated transmission errors?\n\nWang Chongmin said: The *Shiwen* notes, \"*Tuo* is also written as *zhao*.\" The *Huainanzi*’s *Zhushu* chapter states: \"Confucius’ intelligence surpassed that of Chang Hong, his courage rivaled Meng Ben’s, his feet could tread the wilds of Jiao and Sou, and his strength could *zhao* the crossbar of a city gate—his abilities were indeed many.\" Gao You’s commentary says: \"*Zhao* means *to lift*.\" The *Lüshi Chunqiu*’s *Shenda* chapter reads: \"Confucius’ strength could lift the crossbar of a city gate.\" Gao You’s commentary says: \"With one hand, he grasped the city gate’s crossbar and lifted it.\" The character *zhuo* (*grasp*) is likely a corruption of *zhao*. Here, *zhao* is used to gloss *ju* (*lift*). Zhang’s commentary states: \"*Tuo* means *to lift*,\" but *tuo* is probably also a corruption of *zhao*. Thus, the *Liezi* originally must have read *zhao*. The *Wen Xuan*’s commentary on the *Wu Du Fu* directly cites it as *zhao*. The *Yilin* quotes it as *ju* (*lift*), which, while capturing the meaning, likely does not preserve the original text of the *Liezi*.\n\nThe *Shiwen* notes: *Jin* is pronounced *jusheng* and means *strength*. *Tuo* is also written as *zhao*. Li Shan’s commentary on the *Wen Xuan*’s *Wu Du Fu* states: \"*Zhao* is the same as *qiao*.\" The *Huainanzi* writes it as *biao*. Xu Shen explains: *Biao* means *to pull*. In ancient times, lifting a city gate’s crossbar from below was difficult.\n\nMozi, though skilled in defense, caused Gongshu Ban to yield, yet he refused to be known for his military knowledge. The annotation explains: Gongshu Ban excelled in crafting siege engines, but Mozi devised defenses that repelled him, earning Ban’s admiration. Yet Mozi did not claim expertise in warfare, for he did not flaunt his ability. The *Shiwen* notes: *Ban* is pronounced *ban*.\n\nThus, the one who truly preserves victory turns strength into weakness—for humility is the mother of triumph.\n\nThe Master’s strength could lift a gate’s crossbar, and Mozi’s skill could subdue enemies, yet neither sought renown through force or strategy but became known for their virtue and power—this is the art of preserving victory by turning strength into weakness.\n\nThose who master skills will inevitably be employed by others, and those who crave triumph will surely encounter stronger foes. Only those who embody virtue, benevolence, and righteousness can command things and inspire transformation.\n\nIn Song there was a man who delighted in practicing benevolence and righteousness. Three generations of his family never wavered in this. His household’s black ox unexpectedly bore a white calf, and he inquired of Confucius. Confucius said: “This is an auspicious omen; offer it to the Supreme Lord.” A year later, the man’s father inexplicably went blind.\n\nThe ox once more bore a white calf. His father again instructed his son to inquire of Confucius. The son said: “Last time we asked, you lost your sight—why ask again?” The father replied: “The words of a sage first oppose, then align. The matter remains unresolved; let us ask once more.” The son again questioned Confucius. Confucius said: “It is an auspicious omen.” He again instructed them to make an offering. The son returned and reported this. His father said: “Follow Confucius’s words.”\n\nA year later, the son inexplicably went blind. Later, Chu attacked Song and besieged its city. The people resorted to exchanging children to eat and breaking bones for fuel. The able-bodied all mounted the walls to fight, and more than half perished. This man, with both father and son afflicted by illness, was spared. When the siege lifted, their ailments both recovered.\n\n**[Annotation]** This is what is meant by fortune and misfortune depending on each other.\n\n**[Exegesis]** The benevolent love others; the righteous aid all things. Three generations without ceasing—such accumulation of goodness runs deep. If one possesses the capacity, it draws forth reward; if not, it brings blessing. This is where lingering fortune gathers. The response of auspicious omens is the sign of goodness, preserving life and securing its benefits. Is the recompense of accumulated conduct mere empty words?\n\nWang Chongmin notes: The *Taiping Yulan* (740) includes the character \"blind\" (盲) before \"ailments\" (疾).\n\nThere was a *lanzi* in Song—\n**[Annotation]** Generally, any person or thing whose origin is unknown is called *lan*.\n\n**[Emendation]** The *Shide Tang* edition reads \"者\" instead of \"主\" in the annotation.\n\nRen Dazhuang remarks: In the annotation \"凡人物不知生出者谓之兰也,\" the character \"生\" is likely a corruption of \"妄.\"\n\nYu Yue observes: The *Shuowen Jiezi* (Gate Radical) states: \"□ means to recklessly enter palace chambers, pronounced like *lan* (阑).\" Thus, the *lan* in *lanzi* is an extended sense of □.\n\nSu Shixue says: The meaning of *lanzi* is unclear; the old annotation glosses *lan* as \"reckless,\" but this is also obscure. In modern vernacular, worthless rogues are called *lan zai* (烂仔), and its meaning may derive from this.\n\nThe *Shiwen* states: The *Shiji* commentary says: \"To enter or exit without a tally is *lan* (阑).\" Ying Shao says: \"*Lan* means reckless.\" This so-called *lanzi* refers to those who wander recklessly by means of their skills. It is suspected that *lan* is interchangeable with *lan* (阑).\n\nRen Dazhuang says: *Lan* (兰) and *lan* (阑) were often used interchangeably in ancient texts. The *Hanshu* (*Biography of Xifu Gong*) states: \"Tears flow like *huanlan* (萑兰).\"臣瓒 comments: \"*Huanlan* means tears streaming down.\" Thus, *lan* is the same as *lan* (阑). The *Biography of Wang Mang* states: \"[They] share the same *lan* (兰) as cattle and horses.\" Yan Shigu explains: \"*Lan* refers to barriers, like the *lan* enclosures for cattle and horses.\" The * Yupian* and *Guangyun* define *lan* (阑) as \"to block\" or \"to confine,\" which aligns with Yan Shigu’s note on \"barrier enclosures.\" The *Hou Hanshu* (*Biography of Gongsun Shu*) states: \"[He] also built ten-tiered red towers and *bolan* (帛兰) boats.\" The commentary explains: \"[They were] adorned with silk on their railings (*lan* 槛).\" Thus, *lan* (阑) is the same as *lan* (兰). The *Guanzi* (*Zhong Kuang*) states: \"*Lan* shields and leather armor.\" The commentary says: \"*Lan* refers to what is called *lanqi* (兰锜), a weapon rack.\" The *Shui Jing Zhu* states: \"The county has the *binglan* (兵阑) of the King of Shu.\" The *Huayang Guozhi* states: \"Shu has *binglan* (兵阑).\" *Lan* shields and *lanqi* are thus *binglan*. Generally, *lan* (阑) is often borrowed as *lan* (兰).\n\nIn this passage of the *Liezi*, *lan* (阑) is written as *lan* (兰). Though the meanings in various texts differ, the interchangeable usage is the same.\n\nHe used his skills to seek favor with the Lord of Song Yuan.\n\nWang Chongmin notes: The *Yiwen Leiju* (60), *Taiping Yulan* (344 and 483) all include the character \"Lord\" (君) after \"Song Yuan.\"\n\nWang Shumin says: The *Beitang Shuchao* (122), *Yiwen Leiju* (33 and 61), and *Taiping Yulan* (569) also include \"Lord\" (君). The *Shilei Fu* (13) cites the *Liezi* biography in the same way.\n\nBo Jun notes: \"Song Yuan\" should follow the *Beitang Shuchao*, *Taiping Yulan*, and *Yiwen Leiju* in adding \"Lord\" (君). The Lord of Song Yuan may be the same as the King of Song Yuan mentioned in the *Shiji* (*Biographies of Divination and Strategies*), supplemented by Chu Shaosun. Sima Zhen’s *Suoyin* refers to the King of Song Yuan as the Lord of Song Yuan, which serves as a precedent. Song Zhi Yan was the first to declare himself king, but he was soon destroyed by Qi, leaving no posthumous title. His private posthumous title was King Kang (*Zhan Guo Ce* and *Lüshi Chunlan* *Yinci*), or King Xian (*Xunzi*). Could this be the Lord Yuan?\n\nQian Mu’s *Xian Qin Zhuzixi Nian Kaobian* (*Examination of the King of Song Yuan*) suggests that the King of Song Yuan was the crown prince of King Yan, but this is mere conjecture.\n\nThe *Lüshi Chunqiu* (*Jun Shou*) states: \"A rustic from Lu sent a *bi* (闭) to the King of Song Yuan,\" who should be the same as this Lord Yuan. There was also a Lord Yuan of Song, son of Lord Ping, but he is not this Lord Yuan.\n\nThe *Shiwen* states: \"技\" is written as \"妓,\" pronounced *qiyi*.\n\nThe Lord of Song Yuan summoned him and had him perform.\n\nBo Jun notes: The character \"Lord\" (君) is likely missing after \"Yuan.\" The following text consistently uses \"Lord Yuan,\" which serves as evidence.\n\nThe *Shiwen* states: \"见\" is pronounced *xiàn*.\n\nHis skill involved using a pair of staffs, twice the length of his body, attached to his shins.\n\nBo Jun notes: \"枝\" in the *Shide Tang* edition is written as \"技\"; the *Taiping Yulan* (344 and 483) writes it as \"杖,\" and (569) as \"枝.\"\n\nThe *Shiwen* states: \"倍\" follows the standard pronunciation. \"属\" is pronounced *zhú*. \"\" is pronounced *jìng*.\n\nHe ran and galloped in tandem, juggling seven swords by tossing them in succession, with five swords always in the air. The Lord of Song Yuan was greatly astonished and immediately bestowed gold and silk upon him.\n\nThere was another *lanzi* skilled in *yanxi*—\n**[Annotation]** Like today’s acrobats who perform daring feats in narrow spaces.\n\nWang Chongmin notes: The second \"又\" is likely a superfluous character; the *Taiping Yulan* (483) omits it.\n\nWang Shumin says: The *Yiwen Leiju* (33) and *Taiping Yulan* (569) also omit the second \"又.\"\n\nUpon hearing of this, he also sought favor with the Lord of Song Yuan.\n\nThe *Shiwen* states: \"复\" is pronounced *fù*, the same below.\n\nThe Lord of Song Yuan grew furious and said: \"In the past, there was one with extraordinary skills who sought my favor—\n**[Annotation]** Referring to the earlier performer.\n\nLu Wenchang notes: Guo Pu’s commentary on the *Shan Hai Jing* (*Land of Long-Legged People*) states: \"Today’s acrobats who perform as *qiaoren* (乔人) likely imitate this.\" *Qiao* (侨) and *qiao* (乔) are interchangeable.\n\nThe *Shiwen* states: \"侨\" is pronounced *qiáo*, meaning \"to lodge.\"\n\n—whose skills were of no use. **[Annotation]** End of sentence. It just so happened that I was in high spirits, so I bestowed gold and silk upon him. He must have heard of this and come again, hoping for my reward.\"\n\nHe was detained and nearly executed. The Northern Song edition omits the character \"拟,\" and Wang’s edition follows it; this character is now restored from other editions.\n\nThe *Yiwen Leiju* (61) includes \"将\" before \"拘,\" and the *Taiping Yulan* (569) includes \"乃\" before \"拘.\"\n\nThe *Shiwen* states: One edition omits the character \"拟.\"\n\nAfter a month, he was released.\n\n**[Annotation]** Though the skills were the same, the timing differed, so rewards and merits cannot be demanded in advance.\n\n**[Exegesis]** Those who accumulate benevolence and righteousness to uphold the Dao may preserve their fortune; those who rely on strength and skill for luck will not enjoy lasting prosperity.\n\nLiezi recounts these two episodes to illustrate the benefits of virtue and conduct.\n\n**[Annotation]** The *Shiwen* renders \"预要\" as \"豫要,\" noting: \"要, read as *yāo* (遥切).\"\n\nDuke Mu of Qin said to Bo Le, \"You are advanced in years.\n**[Annotation]** Bo Le was skilled in evaluating horses.\n**[Annotation]** *Shiwen* notes: \"长, read as *zhǎng* (张丈切).\" \"相, read as *xiàng* (息亮切), same below.\"\n\nIs there anyone among your kinsmen who can be sent to seek horses?\"\n**[Annotation]** The question asks whether any of Bo Le’s lineage possesses the ability to evaluate horses and succeed him.\n**[Annotation]** Sun Yirang notes: The *Te Sheng Kui Shi Li* states, \"The sons and grandsons of the deceased wear the same mourning attire as the host.\" Zheng Xuan’s commentary explains: \"The term *zi xing* refers to the descendants of the one being sacrificed. The phrase means 'those born of the son.'\" The *Sang Da Ji* records, \"Ministers, great officers, uncles, brothers, and *zi xing* stand to the east.\" The commentary explains: \"*Zi xing* refers to all descendants.\" *Xing* means \"born.\" The *Guoyu: Chu Yu* states, \"Leading their *zi xing*,\" with Wei Zhao’s commentary: \"*Zi xing* refers to those of the same lineage.\"\n\nBo Le replied, \"A fine horse can be discerned by its form, appearance, sinews, and bones.\n**[Annotation]** A superior horse can be identified by its physical structure.\n**[Annotation]** Wang Chongmin notes: The *Yiwen Leiju* (93) includes the character \"以\" after \"可,\" which is correct. The *Huainanzi: Daoying* chapter concurs.\n**[Annotation]** *Shiwen* notes: \"筋, pronounced *jīn* (斤).\"\n\nAs for the horse of all under heaven, it is as if vanished, as if concealed, as if lost, as if gone.\n**[Annotation]** The peerless horse of the world cannot be sought in form, bones, or coat; thus, it appears indistinct, as if present yet absent, difficult to recognize.\n**[Annotation]** *Shiwen* notes: \"仿佛, *fǎng fú* (昉芳味切).\" \"恍惚, *huǎng hū* (怳忽).\"\n\nSuch a horse leaves no dust nor track.\n**[Annotation]** This describes its extreme swiftness.\n**[Annotation]** *Shiwen* notes: \"弭, pronounced *mǐ* (亡尔切).\" \"□, meaning 'track,' also written as 彻 in one edition.\"\n\nMy sons are all of inferior talent. Wang Lai notes: Based on Lu’s explanation below—\"*zi xing* refers to those of the same lineage among younger generations\"—the character \"姓\" is missing after \"臣之子.\" Yang Bojun counters: The *Huainanzi: Daoying* chapter also omits \"姓\" after \"臣之子,\" so Wang’s claim is unfounded.\n\nI can instruct them in identifying fine horses, but not in recognizing the horse of all under heaven. I have one with whom I share the task of carrying ropes and gathering firewood and greens.\n**[Annotation]** This refers to one who carries ropes and collects firewood and greens, likely a menial laborer. All editions write \"缠,\" but Wang Niansun argues: The character \"缠\" is glossed in various texts as \"winding\" (*Shuowen*) or \"binding\" (*Guangya*), but never as \"rope.\" It should be \"纆,\" a character for \"rope\" in the *Shuowen* (written as □), sometimes appearing as \"纆.\" The *Yijing*, *Kan* hexagram, line six, states: \"系用徽纆.\" Ma Rong explains: \"徽纆 means rope.\" Liu Biao adds: \"Three strands make a *hui*; two strands make a *mo*.\" Most people are familiar with \"缠\" but not \"纆,\" leading to frequent transcription errors. Only the *Daozang* edition of the *Liezi Shiwen* writes \"纆,\" pronounced *mò* (墨), confirming the error in current editions.\n**[Annotation]** Zhu Huan notes: The *Gongyang Zhuan* (Year 14 of Duke Ai) states, \"Then who hunts? The gatherers of firewood.\" The *Mao Commentary* on the *Odes* (*Daya*) explains: \"*Chu rao* refers to gatherers of firewood.\" \"*Chu rao*\" is synonymous with \"*cai xin*\" (gathering firewood); \"*cai*\" may also be written as \"*cài*.\"\n**[Annotation]** Yu Yue argues: \"共\" is a miswriting of \"供.\" The *Shiwen* includes an alternate reading as \"供,\" which is correct. The phrase likely means this person supplies both carrying ropes and gathering firewood. \"担缠薪菜\" describes two tasks: \"担缠\" refers to carrying goods, while \"薪菜\" refers to gathering fuel for cooking. \"缠\" is a miswriting of \"纆,\" and \"菜\" should be \"采,\" as the characters were interchangeable in ancient times.\n**[Annotation]** *Shiwen* notes: \"共, meaning 'together,' also written as 供.\" \"担, pronounced *dān* (丁甘切).\" \"纆, pronounced *mò* (墨).\"\n\nThere is one named Jiu Fang Gao.\" The *Huainanzi* and *Lüshi Chunqiu: Guan Biao* chapter write this as \"Jiu Fang Yin.\"\n**[Annotation]** Hu Huaichen notes: \"Jiu Fang\" is the surname; \"Gao\" is the given name. The *Zhuangzi* mentions Jiu Fang Yin. The *Tongzhi* claims Jiu Fang Gao and Jiu Fang Yin are the same person. I humbly suggest that \"jiu\" and \"gui\" are phonetically close and interchangeable. The *Records of the Grand Historian: Yin Benji* states: \"With the Three Dukes—Xibo, Jiuhou, and Ehou,\" where Xu Guang’s commentary notes: \"One version writes 'Guihou,'\" providing evidence. Thus, \"Jiu Fang\" may derive from the Shang-era Guifang, taking the region as their surname. Whether Gao and Yin are the same person requires further investigation.\n**[Annotation]** Yang Bojun notes: The *Wen Xuan: Zhang Xie’s Seven Commands* cites the *Lüshi Chunqiu*, referring to Jing Yang’s use of the *Lüshi Chunqiu*.\n**[Annotation]** Wang Shumin notes: The *Huainanzi: Daoying* chapter omits the character \"有\" before \"九.\" This \"有\" may be a superfluous interpolation from the preceding \"有.\" The *Yiwen Leiju* (93), *Shilei Fu* (21), *Taiping Yulan* (896), *Jizuan Yuanhai* (98), and *Shiwen Leiju: Houji* (38) all omit \"有\" before \"九.\"\n**[Annotation]** *Shiwen* notes: \"皋, pronounced *gāo* (高).\"\n\nIn evaluating horses, he is not beneath me.\"\n**[Annotation]** All editions write \"比,\" but the *Daozang* unannotated edition, Lin Xiyi’s edition, Yuan edition, and Shide Hall edition write \"此,\" as does the *Huainanzi*. Lu Wenchang argues: \"比\" is a particle introducing speech. The *Mencius* states, \"比 the gifts bestowed by Heaven upon me,\" and Jia Yi writes, \"比物此志,\" both examples of this usage.\n**[Annotation]** Yang Bojun counters: Lu’s argument is unconvincing. In the *Mencius*, \"比\" means \"all,\" while in Jia Yi’s *Biography*, \"比物\" means \"to categorize\" (following Wang Xianqian’s *Hanshu Buzhu*).\n\nThe character *bi* (比) cannot serve as an introductory particle. Moreover, in the *Mencius*, the character *bi* (比) is often written as *ci* (此) in modern editions, and in Jia Yi’s *Biography*, the *bi* (比) in \"比物\" appears as *ci* (此) in the *Xinshu*. This shows that in ancient texts, *bi* (比) and *ci* (此) were frequently confused due to their graphic similarity. Here, it should read *ci* (此), not *bi* (比), and we follow the *Daozang* unannotated edition in emending it.\n**[Annotation]** *Shiwen* notes: \"One edition writes *bi* (比).\"\n\n\"[He is] not beneath me\" means [the horse] surpasses oneself.\n**[Annotation]** Those who carry firewood and gather vegetables are menial laborers. *Zixing* refers to those of the same clan as one’s descendants.\n**[Annotation]** *Shiwen* notes: *guo* (过), pronounced *gǔ* (古卧切); *jian* (见), pronounced *xiàn* (贤遍切), same below.\n\nDuke Mu saw him and sent him to seek a horse. After three months, he returned and reported: \"I have found it; it is in Shaqiu.\"\n**[Annotation]** A place name.\n\nDuke Mu asked: \"What kind of horse is it?\"\nHe replied: \"A yellow mare.\"\nWhen someone was sent to retrieve it, it proved to be a black stallion. Duke Mu was displeased.\n**[Annotation]** *Shiwen* notes: *shuō* (说), pronounced *yuè* (悦).\n\nHe summoned Bo Le and said to him: \"You have failed, the one you sent to seek a horse!\n**[Annotation]** Referring to Jiu Fang Gao.\n**[Annotation]** Wang Shu-min notes: The *Yiwen Leiju* (93), *Shilei Fu* (21), *Taiping Yulan* (896), *Jizuan Yuanhai* (98), and *Shiwen Leiju: Houji* (38) all include \"之\" after \"子.\" The *Huainanzi: Daoying Xun* does as well; this should be followed.\n\nHe cannot even discern color and sex—\n**[Annotation]** Lu Wenchang notes: The *Taiping Yulan* (896) writes \"物色\" for \"色物.\"\n**[Annotation]** Yang Bojun notes: In the *Huainanzi: Daoying Xun*, \"色\" appears as \"毛.\" This should be followed. *Mao* refers to pure color; *wu* (物), to mixed color. See Yang Shuda’s *Jiwei Ju Xiaoxue Shulin: Shiwu* for details.\n\n—how could he know anything of horses?\"\nBo Le sighed deeply and said: \"Has it truly come to this?\"\n\nThis is why his skill surpasses mine by a thousand or ten thousandfold, beyond measure.\n**[Annotation]** His art of judging horses is so extraordinary that he surpasses me by an incalculable degree.\n\n**[Exegesis]** Gao observes the horse’s spirit, not its form. Form is what ordinary people discern. Bo Le sighed in admiration at how he forgot form to grasp the spirit, how his focus had reached such a point—realizing he himself fell short of Gao by an immeasurable margin. Thus, while Duke Mu saw failure, Bo Le saw ability.\n\nWhat Gao perceived was the *heavenly mechanism*—\n**[Annotation]** The *heavenly mechanism* refers to what governs the outward form and bones, enabling movement of hooves and limbs. It is grasped in the mind yet leaves no visible trace.\n\n—capturing its essence while forgetting its coarse aspects.\n**[Annotation]** The *Yiwen Leiju* (93), *Peiwen Yunfu* (3), *Tianzhong Ji* (55), *Jingji Leipian* (98), and *Shiwen Leiju: Houji* (38) all include \"而\" here, as do the *Daozang* unannotated edition, Lin Xiyi’s edition, Jifu edition, and Shidetang edition. The *Shiwen Yuelu* notes: *Cu* (coarse) is pronounced like *lu* (deer).\n\nHe saw what lay within while forgetting what lay without—\n**[Annotation]** The *inner essence* refers to the *heavenly mechanism*; the *outer coarse* refers to sex and coat color.\n\nXu Weiyu notes: *Zai* (在) here means \"to examine.\"\n\n—seeing what should be seen,\n**[Annotation]** What should be seen is only the *heavenly mechanism.*\n\n—and not seeing what should not be seen.\n**[Annotation]** What should not be seen includes coat color and sex.\n\nHe fixed his gaze on what ought to be gazed upon—\n**[Annotation]** The *Zang* edition includes \"其\" before \"所.\"\n\n—and disregarded what should not be regarded.\n**[Annotation]** What should not be regarded is not given deliberate attention.\n\nSuch was Gao’s judgment—one that valued what truly mattered in a horse.\n**[Annotation]** Gao’s method was not merely about judging horses; what he attained through spiritual insight must hold a value beyond mere horse-judging, for his art was sublime.\n\n**[Annotation]** The *Sijie* edition reads \"相马\" (judging horses) instead of \"相者\" (judgment). Wang Chongmin notes: The Northern Song edition, *Daozang* edition, and Jifu edition all read \"者,\" which is likely correct. The error may stem from the repeated use of \"马\" (horse) in the surrounding text. The *Huainanzi: Daoying Xun* reads: \"What he judged held a value beyond mere horses.\"\n\nThe horse arrived and proved to be a steed of the world.\n**[Exegesis]** Form and substance are the manifest aspects of the myriad things; spirit and *qi* are the subtle, formless essence. That which operates through form is itself formless; that which employs the formless gives shape to things. Though used all day, its workings go unnoticed; though set in motion year after year, it is not deemed laborious. To know and nurture it is to master the Dao.\n\nWhat Gao saw in what he saw was the spirit. To align with the spirit is to value what truly matters in a horse—something no one else of his time understood.\n\nKing Zhuang of Chu asked Zhan He:\n**[Annotation]** The *Shiwen Yuelu* notes: *Zhan* is pronounced like *zhan* (占).\n\n\"How should one govern the state?\"\n**[Annotation]** Zhan He was likely a recluse.\n\nZhan He replied: \"I am skilled in governing the self but unskilled in governing the state.\"\n**[Annotation]** The *Zhiyi* reads \"何\" (He) instead of \"臣\" (I). The *Lüshi Chunqiu: Zhiyi* also reads \"何闻为身不闻为国\" (He has heard of governing the self but not of governing the state), as does the *Huainanzi: Daoying Xun*.\n\nKing Zhuang of Chu said:\n**[Annotation]** Wang Shumin notes: The character \"庄\" (Zhuang) is superfluous. Since \"King Zhuang of Chu\" was already mentioned above, it need not be repeated here. The *Zhiyi* omits it, as does the *Huainanzi: Daoying Xun*.\n\n\"I have been entrusted with the ancestral temples and the altars of soil and grain. I wish to learn how to preserve them.\"\n\nZhan He replied: \"I have never heard of a case where one’s self was well-governed yet the state fell into chaos.\n**[Annotation]** These two lines also appear in the *Huainanzi: Quan Yan Xun*. The *Shiwen Yuelu* notes: *Zhi* (治, govern) is pronounced like *zhi* (直吏切); the same applies to *guo zhi* (国治, state governance).\n\nNor have I ever heard of a case where one’s self was in disorder yet the state was well-governed. Thus, the root lies in the self; I dare not respond with mere branches.\"\n\nThe king said: \"Well said.\"\n\n**[Exegesis]** To diminish things for the sake of enriching life is the common inclination of petty men; to diminish life for the sake of benefiting things is the deceptive conduct of those who crave fame. To secure the altars of the state, one must place the self after. He who governs the self well finds the state governs itself. The ruler is the master of the state; the spirit is the master of the body. Governing the state lies in pacifying the ruler; governing the self lies in pacifying the spirit. When the spirit is at peace, the Dao is exalted; when the Dao is exalted, the state is well-governed. The spirit is the root of the self; the Dao is the function of the spirit. Thus, he dared not respond with mere branches.\n\nThe Elder of Huqiu said to Sunshu Ao:\n**[Annotation]** A minister of Chu. Yang Bojun notes: The *Shuo Yuan: Jing Shen* records this event differently. The *Shiwen Yuelu* notes: *Ao* (敖) is pronounced like *lao* (五劳切). Sunshu Ao was a minister of Chu.\n\n\"Do you know the three things that incur resentment?\"\n**[Annotation]** Huqiu was a town name. *Zhangren* (丈人) refers to an elder. The *Shiwen Yuelu* notes: *Zhang* (长) is pronounced like *zhang* (张丈切).\n\nSunshu Ao asked: \"What are they?\"\n\nThe elder replied: \"Those with high rank are envied by others; those with great office are resented by their lord;\n**[Annotation]** The *Shiwen Yuelu* notes: *Wu* (恶) is pronounced like *wu* (乌路切).\n\nthose with generous emoluments are targeted by grievances.\"\n**[Annotation]** Yu Yue notes: The *Huainanzi: Daoying Xun* reads \"禄厚者怨处之\" (those with generous emoluments are the dwelling place of resentment), which is correct. *Chu* (处) means the dwelling place of enmity, akin to saying \"a storehouse of resentment.\" *Chu* rhymes with *du* (妒, envy) and *wu* (恶, resentment). If written as *dai* (逮), the rhyme is lost—likely a later alteration by someone who misunderstood *chu*. Wang Chongmin notes: Yu Yue’s argument is sound; the *Taiping Yulan* (459) reads \"处\" instead of \"逮.\"\n\nThe Northern Song edition reads \"distant\" (远), which is incorrect. (*Yilin* cites it as: \"Those with generous emoluments are resented by others.\") Sunshu Ao said: \"The higher my rank, the more I lower my aspirations; the greater my office, the more I diminish my heart; the more generous my emoluments, the more I broaden my bestowals. Wang Chongmin notes: The *Yilin* cites 'broad' (博) as 'universal' (溥), and it is likely that 'universal' is the correct reading. May this spare me from the three resentments?\"\n\n**[Annotation]** *Shiwen* notes: *Shi* (施) is pronounced like *shi* (始豉切).\n\n**[Exegesis]** To diminish one’s heart is the application of the Dao; to broaden one’s bestowals is the application of virtue. He who applies the Dao to humble himself incurs no resentment; he who applies virtue to bestow universally earns the lord’s favor. From whence could the three resentments arise?\n\nWang Shumin notes: The narrative here is incomplete; there may be missing text. The *Han Shi Waizhuan* (7) adds the following fifteen characters after this passage: \"The Elder of Fox Hill said: 'Excellent words! Even Yao and Shun would find them difficult to achieve.'\" This may well be the correct reading.\n\nWhen Sunshu Ao fell ill and was near death, he admonished his son: \"The king has repeatedly offered me enfeoffment, but I have declined.\" Yu Yue notes: *Ji* (亟) means \"repeatedly,\" indicating the king has frequently offered enfeoffment, but he has refused. Below, the text reads, \"the cities fear his frequency,\" with the annotation \"亟 means repeatedly.\" This should be interpreted the same way. Wang Xianqian notes: The *Lüshi Chunqiu: Yibao* reads, \"The king has repeatedly offered me enfeoffment, but I have declined,\" which confirms this reading.\n\n**[Annotation]** *Shiwen* notes: *Ji* (亟) is pronounced like *ji* (纪力切), meaning \"urgent.\"\n\n\"If I die, the king will enfeoff you. You must not accept fertile land!\" Wang Niansun notes: *Wei* (为) means \"if,\" as in \"if I die and the king enfeoffs you, you must not accept fertile land.\" In ancient texts, *wei* (为) is sometimes used in place of *ru* (如). The *Guanzi: Jie* states: \"When Guan Zhong was gravely ill, Duke Huan visited him. Guan Zhong said: 'The states of Jiang and Huang are near Chu. If your servant dies, you must return them to Chu as a trust.'\" Here, *wei* means \"if your servant dies.\" The *Strategies of the Warring States* records: \"When Queen Xuan of Qin was ill and near death, she issued a decree: 'If I am buried, you must use Wei Zi as a funerary companion.'\" Here, *wei* means \"if I am buried.\"\n\n**[Annotation]** *Shiwen* notes: *Wei* (为) is pronounced like *wei* (于伪切).\n\n\"Between Chu and Yue lies a place called Qin Qiu, where the land is inauspicious and the name most ill-omened.\" Wang Xianqian notes: Given the phrase \"most ill-omened,\" *qin* (寝) should be read as in the *Records of the Grand Historian: Biographies of Wei Qi and Wu’an*, where \"Wu’an’s appearance was *qin*\" (侵), meaning \"ugly\" or \"repulsive.\" This aligns with the *Huainanzi: Zhengwen Renjian Xun*.\n\nThe people of Chu revere ghosts, and the people of Yue believe in omens.\n\n**[Annotation]** *Ji* (禨) is pronounced *ji* (巨衣切) or *jī* (居希切).\n\nThe *Huainanzi* states: \"The people of Wu revere ghosts; the people of Yue believe in omens.\" Dai Enfu notes: In the current edition of the *Huainanzi*, \"Wu\" is written as \"Jing,\" and \"omens\" (禨) as \"畿.\" The *Shuowen Jiezi*, under the entry for *ji* (□), cites the *Huainanzi*: \"The people of Wu revere ghosts; the people of Yue believe in □.\" Thus, \"畿\" is a corruption of \"□.\"\n\n**[Annotation]** *Shiwen* notes: *Ji* (禨) is pronounced *ji* (几), meaning \"omen,\" or *jī* (畿).\n\n\"Only this place can be held in perpetuity.\" When Sunshu Ao died, the king indeed offered his son fertile land. The son declined and instead requested Qin Qiu.\n\n**[Annotation]** *Shiwen* notes: Qin Qiu is located in Gushi.\n\nThe *Records of the Grand Historian* states: \"Sunshu Ao was on good terms with You Meng. Later, You Meng spoke to King Zhuang, who summoned Sunshu Ao’s son and enfeoffed him at Qin Qiu.\" The enfeoffment endures to this day.\n\n**[Annotation]** Xiao He of the Han dynasty also said: \"Do not let your descendants be overpowered by influential families.\" This is of the same principle.\n\n**[Exegesis]** What people contend for, the strong inevitably seize. What yields meager profit, people disregard. Things unclaimed endure in their benefit; things fiercely contested cannot be long preserved. People know only to vie for rich gain, not that lasting possession yields deeper profit. Thus, objects of desire are grounds for strife; preserving the Dao is the path to enduring advantage. Those skilled in the Dao extend its principle to all things—wherever they turn, how is it not the Dao?\n\n**[Collation]** *Huainanzi*’s \"Among Men\" and *Lüshi Chunqiu* closely parallel this passage. Only *Hanfeizi*’s \"Illustrating the Laozi\" states: \"After King Zhuang of Chu triumphed, he hunted at Heyong and, upon returning, rewarded Sunshu Ao. Sunshu Ao requested the barren land between the Han River, where sand and stones lay. By Chu’s law, a minister’s fief was reclaimed after two generations—only Sunshu Ao’s endured.\"\n\n**[Annotation]** *Ni Que*: *Que* is pronounced *qīngxuě*. A great Confucian of Shangdang, he traveled to Handan.\n\n**[Annotation]** *Handan* is pronounced *Hándān*.\n\n**[Annotation]** Liang Yusheng notes: The *Han Geography Treatise* and *Shuowen* record that the Yu River rises northwest of Xiangguo County in Zhao; Yan Shigu glosses it as *ǒu*. The *Universal Geography Record*, fascicle 59, states that the Yu River lies seventeen *li* northwest of Shahe County in Xingzhou. Both name it the Shahe River, which is *Ŏushā*.\n\n**[Collation]** The Shahe River lies south of the former seat of Shahe County in Xingtai, Hebei. The present county seat has since relocated to Dalian Town, placing the river north of the current seat.\n\n**[Annotation]** Yu Yue remarks: The text should read, \"seized all his clothing, carts, and horses; Ni Que departed on foot.\"\n\nThe *Master Lü’s Spring and Autumn Annals*, \"Necessarily So\" chapter, reads: \"They demanded his carts and horses, and he gave them; they demanded his clothing and bedding, and he gave them. Ni Que departed and went on his way\"—this serves as evidence. The character \"出\" (*departed*) is simply a miswriting of \"步\" (*walked*). Here, the text omits the characters \"马\" (*horses*) and \"缺\" (*Ni Que*), thus erroneously joining \"车\" (*carts*) and \"牛\" (*oxen*) as a compound. He appeared joyful and untroubled. The bandits pursued him and asked the reason. He replied, \"The noble man does not allow what nourishes him to harm that which he nourishes.\" Tao Hongqing said: The second \"所\" (*that which*) is superfluous; the *Huainanzi*, \"Among the People\" chapter, reads, \"The sage does not allow what nourishes him to harm his nourishment,\" which may be taken as the correct version. Wang Chongmin said: Tao’s view is likely incorrect; rather, the character \"以\" (*with*) is missing below the first \"所.\" The *Zhuangzi*, \"Yielding the Throne\" chapter, states: \"Moreover, I have heard that one does not allow what one employs for nourishment to harm that which one nourishes.\" In the *Master Lü’s Spring and Autumn Annals*, \"Examining Responsibility\" chapter, \"用\" (*employ*) is written as \"以\" (*with*), for *yong* (employ) and *yi* (with) are interchangeable. The *Imperial Digest*, fascicle 499, cites it as: \"The noble man does not allow what nourishes him to harm that by which he is nourished,\" which is semantically incoherent. It is likely that the \"以\" originally appeared below the first \"所,\" and the compiler mistakenly transposed it. The bandits exclaimed, \"Ah! How worthy he is!\"\n\nThe *Explication of Text* states: \"嘻\" is pronounced *xu qi*. \"夫\" is read as *fu*.\n\nThereupon they said to one another: \"With his such virtue, if he goes to see the Lord of Zhao and makes us his *affair*, he will surely bring us to ruin.\" The Qin engraving and Lu’s edition read \"使\" (*makes*) as \"便\" (*then*). Tao Hongqing said: Below \"使以我为\" (*makes us his*), the character \"事\" (*affair*) is missing. The *Huainanzi*, \"Among People\" chapter, states: \"If one appears before the king with this, he will surely take me as his *affair*,\" which may be used to supply the omission. Wang Chongmin said: Tao’s view is correct. The *Imperial Digest*, fascicles 402 and 499, both include the character \"事\" below \"为.\" The *Explication of Text* reads: \"Goes to see the Lord of Zhao, takes me as his *affair*, and will surely bring me to ruin,\" marking \"为\" as the end of a phrase. Another edition reads: \"Goes to see the Lord of Zhao, then takes me as one who will surely bring ruin.\" \"It would be better to kill him.\" Thereupon they pursued and killed him.\n\nWhen the people of Yan heard of this, they gathered their clans and warned one another, saying: \"When encountering bandits, do not be like Niu Que of Shangdi!\" All heeded the lesson. Soon after, his younger brother went to Qin.\n\nWhen he reached the pass below, the Northern Song edition, Wang edition, and *Four Explications* edition read \"阙,\" while the *Daoist Canon* unannotated edition, Lin Xiyi edition, Jiang Yue edition, Yuan edition, and Shide Hall edition read \"关.\" Here, it is corrected to \"关.\" The *Hanfeizi*’s *Preserving Han* chapter states: \"Han turned back and, together with the feudal lords, took the lead in forming a wild-geese formation to face the Qin army at the pass below.\" The *Gandao* edition reads \"阙\" for \"关.\" Wang Xianshen said: \"阙 is a corruption of 关 due to graphical proximity, referring to Hangu Pass.\" The *Explication of Text* notes: \"One edition reads 阙.\" Indeed, he encountered bandits.\n\nRecalling his elder brother’s warning, the *Explication of Text* reads \"意\" for \"忆,\" noting: \"One edition reads 忆.\" Thereupon he struggled fiercely with the bandits. The *Explication of Text* notes: \"争 is pronounced 诤.\" Yet he was no match for them. Bo Jun notes: \"如 should be 与.\" Again, he pursued them and humbly begged for his belongings. The bandits grew enraged, saying: \"I spared your life generously, yet you persist in chasing us—your tracks will soon be exposed. Once a bandit, where is there room for benevolence?\" The *Explication of Text* notes: \"焉 is pronounced 于虔切.\" They killed him and also murdered four or five of his companions.\n\n**[Annotation]** Niu Que brought disaster upon himself by failing to avoid trouble, while the people of Yan, though cautious, still met with misfortune. Such are the unpredictable turns of safety and peril.\n\n**[Explication]** Those who understand the times and respond to principle act without confusion when events arise, seize opportunities when they come, move in accord with their true nature, and adapt to change. But if one flaunts fame and leaves traces, ill-suited to the moment, there is no path that does not end in failure. Niu Que did not grasp the times, and his younger brother overreached—just as the two sons of the Meng clan, though descended from Wen and Wu, met their downfall! Those who overcorrect their reputation invariably end thus.\n\nYu Shi was a wealthy man of Liang. His household overflowed with abundance. Bo Jun notes: The *Huainanzi*’s *Among People* chapter includes the character \"盈\" after \"充.\" His wealth in coin and silk was immeasurable. The *Explication of Text* notes: \"量 is read in the departing tone.\" His treasures and goods were beyond reckoning. Wang Chongmin said: The *Imperial Digest* (fascicle 33) and *Imperial Digest* (fascicle 472) both read: \"His household was already full and flourishing; his coin and silk were immeasurable; his wealth and goods were unmatched.\" The *Explication of Text* notes: \"訾 is pronounced 髭, meaning beyond measure.\" Jia Kui’s commentary on the *Guoyu* states: \"赀 means measure.\"\n\nHe ascended a high tower overlooking the main road, where he set up music and arranged wine, playing *bo* on the upper floor. The *Explication of Text* notes: \"击 means to strike, as in the game of *shuanglu* or *go* today.\" Wei Zhao’s *On Bo and Yi* states: \"Setting up wooden pieces and striking them.\" The ancient *Bo Classic* says: \"The rules of *bo*: two players face each other across a board divided into twelve paths, with the two ends at the center called the 'water.' Twelve pieces are used—six white, six black—along with two fish pieces placed in the water. The dice are made of *qiong*, square with sides of one *cun* and three *fen*, and a length of one *cun* and five *fen*, tapered at the head and carved with eyes on four sides, also called 'teeth.' The two players take turns throwing the dice to move their pieces. When a piece reaches a certain point, it is called a 'valiant piece' and enters the water to eat a fish, also called 'pulling a fish.' Each fish pulled earns two tallies; flipping a fish earns three. If one has already pulled two fish but fails to win, it is called 'being flipped for two fish,' and the opponent gains six tallies for a great victory.\" *畟* is pronounced *ze*. Knights-errant followed him as he traveled.\n\nOn the lower floor, gamblers were casting their dice. Wang Chongmin remarked: \"'On the lower floor' should replace 'on the upper floor.' This describes how, when the Yu clan was hosting music, serving wine, and playing dice for wagers in a high tower, knights-errant followed along and passed beneath it—just as a kite dropped a rotting rat and struck one of them, leading them to suspect the Yu clan had deliberately humiliated them from above. Had the knights-errant already ascended to the upper floor, such a misunderstanding could not have arisen. The error likely stems from the earlier phrase 'gambling on the upper floor.'\"\n\n*Leiju* 95 quotes it as: \"Knights-errant followed along beneath the tower, where a gambler’s cast struck the mark, and they laughed.\" Though the passage is brief, the phrase \"beneath the tower\" is certainly correct.\n\nBo Jun notes: Reading \"on the upper floor\" as belonging to the following sentence makes it clear that the knights-errant were below. The *Shiwen* punctuates it as: \"gamblers cast their dice.\" *She* is pronounced *shi* (食亦切). When the dice reveal a bright *qiong*—five white \"teeth\"—the player flips the fish pieces and laughs. The commentary explains: \"Bright *qiong* refers to five white faces. Casting five white wins the throw, flipping both fish secures victory, hence the great\" (the note \"吐合切\" following \"作\" is omitted here, following the Northern Song edition). The *Shiwen* writes \"\" as \"\"; the *Zang* edition has \"笑,\" while the *Qin* edition writes \"\" and notes: *zhong* is pronounced *dingzhong* (丁仲切).\n\n\"Fan\" is pronounced *fan*.  is pronounced *talà*. In all games where one vies to hit the mark, it is called *she* (to shoot) or *tou* (to cast). Pei Yin states: \"To report the *cai* and obtain the fish.\" According to the *Zhenjing* edition,  is sometimes written as *yu* (fish); the *Dabo Jing* writes it as *die* (flounder), a fish with paired eyes. This likely refers to the two fish as a pair like the flounder’s eyes. Here, it means that upon reporting the *cai* and hitting the mark, one flips the two fish, wins decisively, and laughs. *Die* is pronounced *taliè*. Modern editions that write 鱼 contain an extra character. By meaning, *die* is used, not *yu*; *yu* is used, not *die*.\n\nA kite, flying by, happened to drop its rotten rat and hit him. The *Shiwen* writes *zhui* (to fall) as *dui*, noting: *yuan* is pronounced *yuan*; *shi* is pronounced *zhi*; *dui* is pronounced *zhui*. The knights-errant said to one another: \"The Yu clan has long enjoyed wealth and ease.\" Wang Shumin notes: The *Liu Tie*, *He Bi Shi Lei Bie Ji*, and *Tian Zhong Ji* all include the character *ji* (already) before *jiu* (long). The *Shiwen* notes: *le* is pronounced *luo*. \"Yet they have always harbored the intent to belittle others.\" The *Shiwen* notes: *yi* is pronounced *yichi*. \"We have not provoked them, yet they insult us with a rotten rat. If we do not avenge this, we will have no way to establish our courage in the world.\" The annotation explains: *qin* means courage. The *Shiwen* notes: *qin* is pronounced *qin* and means courage. \"Let us join forces with a single purpose, lead our followers, and surely destroy their household to set an example.\" The character *lu* (to join forces) in the *Sijie* edition is written as *lu*. The *Shiwen* writes *lu* as *lu*, noting: it is pronounced *liu* and means to combine strength. All agreed. On the appointed night, they gathered their forces and weapons to attack the Yu clan, utterly destroying their household. The annotation explains: Arrogance and extravagance lead to disaster through many paths. Though the Yu clan had no intention of oppressing others, their household was ruined, for they had not long practiced the conduct of humility and restraint. The commentary states: The previous chapter spoke of learning benevolence and righteousness through the Three Dynasties to bring about auspiciousness; this chapter speaks of accumulating arrogance and extravagance to invite disaster in a single morning. When one’s conduct is not firmly established, flying calamities strike. There is no fixed gate for fortune or misfortune—each is summoned by the person. These two accounts, presented together, serve as a profound warning. The *Shiwen* writes *jibing* (to gather weapons) as *jingbing* (to gather elite troops), noting: one edition writes *jibing*. *Xing* is pronounced *xiameng*.\n\nIn the east there was a man named Yuan Jingmu. Wang Shumin notes: The *Lüshi Chunqiu* (*Jieli* chapter), *Xinshu* (*Jieshi* chapter), and *Jinlouzi* (*Zaji* chapter) all write *ren* (person) as *shi* (scholar). Jiang Chaobo notes: In Zhang Heng’s *Yingjian*, \"Yuan Jingmu\" is written as \"Jingmao,\" with the line: \"With suspicion in his heart, even fine grain and delicacies he disdains to eat, and so he grows emaciated.\" Bo Jun notes: The commentary to Zhang Heng’s *Biography* writes *jing* as *jing*. The *Xinlun* (*Wangxia* chapter) in the annotations by Yuan Xiaozheng, as well as the *Beishanlu* (*Shibinwen* chapter) and *Yixue* chapter annotations, all write *jing* as *jing*. When he was about to set out on a journey, Wang Shumin notes: The *Taiping Yulan* (499) includes the character *suo* (place) before *shi* (to go), making the meaning more complete. The *Xinshu* (*Jieshi* chapter) also includes *suo*. he starved on the road. A thief from Hufu named Qiu saw him and descended with a gourd of food to feed him. Lu Wenchang notes: The *Zang* edition writes *can* (food) as *sun* (porridge). The *Shiwen* writes *can* as *sun*, noting: *fu* is pronounced *fu*, the same below; *sun* is pronounced *sun* and means water-soaked rice; *bu* is pronounced *fu*. After three feedings, Yuan Jingmu could finally see and asked: \"Who are you?\" Bo Jun notes: The *Xinshu* (*Jieshi* chapter) writes this as \"Who are you?\" He replied: \"I am Qiu from Hufu.\" Jiang Chaobo notes: Hufu is a place name. The *Xunzi* (*Rongru* chapter) states: \"What is called using a Hufu dagger to split cow dung.\" Yang Liang’s annotation: \"Hufu is a place name.\" The *Records of the Grand Historian* states: \"Wu Bei said: The King of Wu’s troops were defeated at Hufu.\" Xu Guang notes: \"Between Liang and Dang.\" Yuan Jingmu said: \"Alas!\"\n\nLu’s *Shiwen* notes: *xi* is pronounced *xi*. \"Are you not a thief? Why did you feed me?\" The annotation states: \"Feed\" was originally written as *can* (eat); now follows the *Shide Tang* edition’s correction. The *Lüshi Chunqiu* (*Jieli* chapter) also writes it as \"feed.\" Lu’s *Shiwen* notes: *shi* (feed) is pronounced *si*. \"In righteousness, I cannot eat food given by you.\" Pressing both hands to the ground, he retched—*Daozang*’s unannotated edition writes *ou* (retch) as *ou* (vomit). The *Shuowen* states: \"Ou means to spit.\" *Ou* is the vulgar character. Lu’s *Shiwen* notes: *ou* is pronounced with the initial *yi* and final *kou*. Unable to expel it, he choked and gasped, then collapsed and died. Wang Shumin notes: The *Shiwen* edition includes the character *di* (ground); this should be followed. The *Lüshi Chunqiu* (*Jieli* chapter), *Xinshu* (*Jieshi* chapter), and *Jinlouzi* (*Zaji* upper chapter) all include the character *di*. The *Shiwen* writes \"collapsed on the ground and died,\" noting: *ke* is pronounced *ke*. One edition omits the character *di*.\n\nThe man of Hufu was indeed a thief, but the food was not stolen. To call the food stolen because the man was a thief and thus refuse to eat it is to confuse names and realities. [Explanation] Seeking reputation while losing reality, violating the Dao and forfeiting life—is this not what befell Yuan Jingmu? One who embodies the Dao does not act thus. If the thief had transformed his heart to achieve benevolence, personally practiced the Way, and others bathed in his influence, then the gentleman’s rescue would have preserved both lives. To retch and lose both is to choke and spit—how false and foolish!\n\nZhu Lishu served Duke Ao of Ju. Believing himself unappreciated, he left and dwelt by the sea—Northern Song, Wang, Qin block (Lu’s commentary), and *Shide Tang* editions write *qu* (left) as *zhe* (one who). Lu Wenchong notes: The *Zang* edition includes a *qu* (left) after *zi* (self). Tao Hongqing states: After *zi* (self), there should be a *yi* (because), and *zhe* (one who) should be *qu* (left), as the two resemble each other in cursive script. The text should read: \"Believing himself unappreciated, he left and dwelt by the sea.\" Below, it reads: \"His friend said, 'You believed yourself unappreciated, so you left'\"; and \"Zhu Lishu said, 'No. I believed myself unappreciated, so I left. Now to die is to prove I was truly unappreciated.'\" Both support this. Bo Jun notes: The *Lüshi Chunqiu* (*Shijun* chapter) writes: \"Believing himself unappreciated, he left and dwelt by the sea,\" which confirms this. Now, following the *Daozang*’s unannotated edition, Lin Xiyi’s edition, Jiang Yu’s edition, and the Jifu edition, *zhe* is emended to *qu*. The *Shuoyuan* (*Lijie* chapter) writes \"Zhu Lishu\" as \"Zhu Lifu\" and \"Duke Ao\" as \"Duke Mu.\" The *Shiwen* writes: \"Believing himself unappreciated, he dwelt by the sea,\" noting: *ji* (self) is pronounced *ji*. One edition writes: \"and left for the sea.\"\n\nIn summer, he ate water caltrop and water chestnut. Xu Weiyu notes: The *Lüshi Chunqiu* (*Shijun* chapter) writes \"water caltrop and water chestnut\" as \"water caltrop and *qian*.\" Gao You’s annotation: \"Ling is water caltrop. Qian is *ji* (water shield), also called *yan tou* (goose head), growing in water.\" The *Huainanzi* (*Shuoshan* chapter) annotation: \"Ji is water *qian*; in Youzhou, it is called *yan tou*.\" The *Gujin Zhu* states: \"Qian’s leaves resemble lotus but are larger, wrinkled like boiling water, with spiny seeds. The kernels inside can stave off hunger.\" The *Shiwen* notes: *ling* is pronounced *ling*. *Ji* is pronounced with the upper rising tone; one edition writes it as *qian*.\n\nIn winter, he ate acorns. The *Shiwen* notes: *xiang* is pronounced *xiang*.\n\nWhen Duke Ao of Ju faced calamity, the *Shiwen* notes: *nan* (calamity) is pronounced *nan*. Zhu Lishu bid his friend farewell and went to die for him. His friend said: \"You believed yourself unappreciated, so you left. Now you go to die for him—this fails to distinguish between appreciation and lack thereof.\" Zhu Lishu said: \"No. I believed myself unappreciated, so I left. Now to die—\" Tao Hongqing states: After \"believed himself unappreciated,\" there should be a *ji* (self), omitted by the copyist. Bo Jun notes: The *Lüshi Chunqiu* (*Shijun* chapter) also omits *ji*. \"—is to prove I was truly unappreciated. I will die to shame later rulers who fail to recognize their ministers.\" To die for those who appreciate you and not for those who do not—this is to act with straightforward integrity. Zhu Lishu may be called one who resented and forgot himself. [Explanation] Though the duke never appreciated him, he died to prove the duke’s failure to appreciate him—how could this be the conduct of one who embodies the Dao? The folly of being ensnared by reputation is thus great, far from those who preserve life and treasure the Dao.\n\nThe *Shiwen* notes: *dui* is pronounced *dui*. One edition writes *wang* (forgot) as *wang* (lost).\n\nYang Zhu said: \"Benefit given returns in kind. Yu Yue states: *Ji* (reaches) is a miswriting of *fan* (returns). *Chu* (given) and *fan* (returns) are like *wang* (go) and *lai* (come), forming a parallel structure. Mencius said: 'What goes forth from you returns to you.'\" [Annotation] Benefit does not travel alone; resentment does not act in isolation—this is the natural order. What arises within elicits response without—only sincerity. [Annotation] *Qing* (sincerity) should be *qing* (emotion). Emotion’s influence knows no distance, depth, or obscurity. Hong Yi states: The ancient character for *yan* (speech) resembles the seal script for *xin* (heart), so *qing* (emotion) is often miswritten as *qing* (request). The *Shiwen* notes: *qing* is pronounced *jing*. The *Zilin* states: *jing* means sincerity.\n\nOne edition pronounces it as *qing* (emotion). The *Shuowen* states: It is the human *yin* qi that harbors desires. Xu Guang says: The ancient character for *qing* (emotion) was sometimes borrowed as *qing* (request). Therefore, the worthy are cautious in what they emit.\n\n[Annotation] Good deeds manifest and bring auspicious responses; evil accumulates and invites calamity.\n[Exegesis] Only *qing* (emotion/sincerity) is as though self-summoned. The coming of fortune and misfortune is like shadow and echo—thus the worthy are cautious in what they emit.\n\nNowadays, those who admire the Dao all cast aside the teachings of names and rites, lightly abandoning ritual and law. They indulge their emotions and follow their own inclinations, believing this to be mastery of life. They regard benevolence and righteousness as fetters, and dwellings as shackles. They neglect karmic retribution and fail to cultivate human affairs. Thus, men like Ji Kang perished without time to reflect, while those like Sima Yi’s lineage were despised by the world as enemies, yet they knew not the truth!\n\nYangzi’s neighbor lost a sheep. [Bo Jun’s note: The *Taiping Yulan* (195) omits the character “人” (person).] He first led his own party, then asked Yangzi’s servants to join the pursuit. Yangzi said: “Alas! Why so many pursuers for one lost sheep?” The neighbor replied: “There are many branching paths.” Upon returning, Yangzi asked: “Did you retrieve the sheep?” The neighbor said: “It is lost.” Yangzi asked: “Why is it lost?” The neighbor replied: “Among the branching paths there were yet more branches. I knew not where to go, so I returned.”\n\n[Wang Shumin’s note: The *Heguanzi*, in its *Tianquan* chapter commentary, writes “是以” (therefore) instead of “所以” (the reason).]\n\nYangzi’s countenance grew sorrowful and changed; for some time he did not speak, and for the rest of the day he did not smile. His disciples found this strange and asked: “The sheep is a lowly beast, and not even yours to own. Why do you grieve so, diminishing your words and laughter?” Yangzi did not answer. The disciples could not fathom his intent.\n\nDisciple Meng Sunyang went out and told Xin Duzi. Later, Xin Duzi entered with Meng Sunyang and asked: “Once there were three brothers who traveled between Qi and Lu, studying under the same master and advancing in the Way of benevolence and righteousness before returning home. Their father asked: ‘What is the Way of benevolence and righteousness like?’ The eldest said: ‘Benevolence and righteousness make me cherish my body before my reputation.’ [Annotation] One does not dare to harm one’s body, hair, or skin. [Bo Jun’s note: The annotation paraphrases the *Classic of Filial Piety*, “Opening the Manifestation” chapter.] The second said: ‘Benevolence and righteousness make me willing to die to achieve reputation.’ [Annotation] One does not seek life at the expense of benevolence; one dies to fulfill benevolence. [Bo Jun’s note: The annotation cites Confucius’ words in the *Analects*, *Wei Linggong* chapter.] The youngest said: ‘Benevolence and righteousness allow me to preserve both body and reputation.’ [Annotation] Being enlightened and wise, one safeguards oneself. [Bo Jun’s note: The annotation quotes a line from the *Book of Songs*, *Da Ya*, “Zheng Min.”] These three methods differ, yet all emerge from Confucianism. Which is right, and which is wrong?”\n\nYangzi said: “There was a man who lived by the river. Accustomed to water, he was bold in swimming. [Annotation: *qiu* is pronounced *qiu* (like *qiu* in ‘prisoner’).] He plied the boat to ferry passengers, earning enough to feed a hundred mouths. Those who came with packed rations to study under him formed a crowd, yet nearly half drowned. [Annotation: *ji* is pronounced *qi* (like *qi* in ‘prayer’).] They originally studied swimming, not drowning, yet the outcome of profit and harm was thus. If one were to ask which is right and which is wrong?”\n\nXinduzi fell silent and left. [Annotation: The *Ji* edition writes *mo* (‘silent’) as *mo* (‘default’).]\n\nMeng Sunyang reproached him, saying: “Why did you pose such a roundabout question, only for the Master to give such an oblique answer? [Annotation by Lu Wenchang: The *Zang* edition writes *pi* (‘oblique’) as *bi* (‘avoid’). Annotation: *yu* is pronounced *yu* (like *yu* in ‘roundabout’), meaning ‘tortuous.’ *Bi* is pronounced *pi* (‘oblique’).] My confusion has only deepened.”\n\nXinduzi said: “The great Dao, by its many forking paths, loses the sheep; the learner, by its many methods, forfeits life. [Annotation: *sang* (‘forfeit’) is pronounced *sang* (like *sang* in ‘loss’), same below.] The learning is not fundamentally different, nor is its root not one, yet its branches diverge so. [Annotation by Bo Jun: The *Complete Jin Literature*, volume 34, records Lu Chen’s letter to Minister of Works Liu Kun: ‘The root is the same, but the branches differ—Yang Zhu mourned this.’ The forger of the *Liezi* may have drawn from this, or perhaps such a passage already existed in ancient texts, which the *Liezi* compiler then adopted.] Only by returning to unity and reverting to oneness can one avoid loss and gain, forfeiture and preservation. [Annotation: *wang* (‘loss’) is pronounced *wu* (like *wu* in ‘without’), same below.]\n\nYou have long attended the Master’s gate and practiced the Master’s Dao, yet you do not grasp the Master’s analogy. [Annotation: *zhang* (‘long’) is pronounced *zhang* (like *zhang* in ‘senior’). Annotation: *kuang* means ‘analogy.’ [Annotation by Bo Jun: The *Book of Han*, *Annals of Meritorious Ministers under Gao, Hui, and Empress Gao*: ‘To compare the past with the present is deeply lamentable.’ Yan Shigu notes: ‘*Kuang* means analogy.’ Here, *kuang* should also be glossed as ‘analogy’ or ‘comparison.’ In the former, it is used as a verb; here, as a noun.] Alas!”\n\n“[Explanation:] The sheep is used as an analogy for the spirit; guarding the spirit without loss is the Dao. Once one loses the sheep and rushes about on branching paths, it cannot be recovered. Simply guarding one’s spirit is to be without loss or gain, and thus without dependence. Those who pursue仁义 (*ren-yi*, benevolence and righteousness) through many paths are likewise.\n\nYang Zhu’s younger brother was named Bu. He wore plain white clothes when he went out. [Annotation: The first *yi* (‘wore’) in *yi su yi* (‘wore plain white clothes’) is pronounced *yì* (like *yì* in ‘clothing’); the same applies below to *yi zi yi* (‘wore black clothes’). The second *yi* in *su yi* (‘plain white clothes’) is read literally.] It rained, so he took off his plain white clothes and put on black ones before returning. His dog, not recognizing him, ran out and barked. Yang Bu grew angry and was about to strike it. [Annotation by Lu Wenchang: In the *Zang* edition, *pu* (‘strike’) is written as *po*; the same below. The *Shiwen* notes that *pu* is written as *po* and pronounced *piàn-bǔ*.] Yang Zhu said: ‘Do not strike it! You would do the same. If your dog had gone out white and returned black, how could you not find it strange?’\n\n[Commentary:] This passage illustrates that when one’s own form changes, external things cannot comprehend it, giving rise to judgments of right and wrong. To not seek within oneself but instead place heavy blame on others is like Yang Bu, who changed his clothes and was surprised by his dog’s barking. [Annotation: In the *Zang* edition, *hou ze* (‘heavy blame’) is written as *zhuan ze* (‘exclusive blame’).]\n\n[Explanation:] When one guards authenticity and returns to unity, even seagulls may be tamed; but if one loses the Dao and alters the constant, even a household dog may become fearful. [Annotation by Xu Weiyu: In the *Han Feizi*, *Shuo Lin Xia*, the character *zi* (‘you’) appears before *qi* (‘how’), which better suits the meaning. The *Shiwen* reads *xiang zhe shi ru gou* (‘formerly made you see the dog’) as *xiang zhe shi ru jian gou*, noting that *xiang* is pronounced *xiàng*. One edition omits the character *jian* (‘see’). Wang Shumin notes: Lin Xi Yi’s *Kou Yi* reads, ‘If one saw a white dog become black,’ suggesting that the edition he saw also included the character *jian*.]\n\nYang Zhu said: ‘Act with goodness not for the sake of fame, yet fame follows; fame does not seek profit, yet profit accrues.’”\n\n“Profit does not seek contention, yet contention comes to it. [The *Shiwen* reads: *zheng* is pronounced *zhèng*; the same below.] Thus the noble person must be cautious in doing good.”\n\n[Annotation:] In matters of wisdom, others will contend with him; in matters of strength, others will vie against him—this is the natural course of events. There has never been one who dwells at the crossroads of fame and profit yet avoids calamity. As the saying goes, “In doing good, do not draw near to fame”—how can this not be true?\n\n[Exegesis:] The goodness that seeks fame is what all contend for. Thus, “in doing good, do not draw near to fame” means not to vie with others for profit. To practice what others cannot practice without boasting—this is to be cautious in doing good.\n\nLu Wenchang notes: In the annotation, the *Zang* edition reads “at the center of profit and fame” instead of “at the crossroads of fame and profit,” and includes the character *er* (‘and’) after *zhong* (‘center’).\n\nBo Jun observes: The *Shuo Yuan*, in its *Jing Shen* chapter, records words by Wei Gongzi Mou that closely resemble this passage.\n\n[The *Shiwen* reads: *nan* is pronounced *nǎndàn*.]\n\nFormerly, there was one who claimed to know the Way to immortality. [The *Daozang* unannotated edition, Lin Xiyi’s edition, and the Jifu edition include the character *you* (‘there’) after *ren* (‘one’); the Northern Song edition, the *Daozang Sijie* edition, Jiang Yue’s edition, the Shidetang edition, and Wang’s edition omit it.] Tao Hongqing said: The characters *yan you* (‘claimed to know’) are transposed in error. Wang Chongmin said: Tao’s view is incorrect; the character *you* (‘there’) is merely missing after *ren* (‘one’). The *Daozang* and Jifu editions both include *you* after *ren*.\n\nBo Jun observes: Following Wang’s reading, if rendered as “formerly, there was one who claimed to know the Way to immortality,” then the one who knew the Way and the one who spoke would be two different people. This would not align with the subsequent text, where the speaker dies. Tao’s reading is closer to the mark.\n\nThe Lord of Yan sent someone to learn it. Before success was achieved, the speaker died. [Bo Jun observes: The *Han Feizi*, in its *Wai Chu Shuo Zuo Shang* chapter, reads: “The scholar he sent had not yet finished learning when he died abroad. The king was enraged and executed him.”]\n\n[The *Shiwen* reads: *jie* is pronounced *yì*.]\n\nThe Lord of Yan was furious and intended to execute his envoy.\n\n[The *Shiwen* reads: *shi* is pronounced *shì*.]\n\nA favored minister admonished him, saying: “Nothing concerns people more urgently than death, and nothing do they value more than life. He himself lost his life—how could he have enabled you to avoid death?” Thus, he was not executed.\n\nThere was a man of Qi who also wished to learn the Way. When he heard that the speaker had died, he struck his chest in regret. Fuzi, hearing of this, laughed and said: “He desired to learn the Way to immortality, yet when the man died, he still regretted it—this is to not understand the purpose of learning.”\n\nHuzi said: “Fuzi’s words are wrong. There are those who possess a method but cannot practice it, and there are those who can practice it but lack the method. There was a man of Wei skilled in calculation who, on the verge of death, explained the method to his son in detail.”\n\nThe character 「决」 appears as 「诀」 in the *Daozang* white-text edition, Lin Xiyi’s edition, the Shidetang edition, and the Jifu edition. Bo Jun notes: The *Shuowen Jiezi* supplement states, “‘诀’ means to part. Another definition: method.” However, *决* may be interchangeable with *诀*, as in Bao Zhao’s poem in the *Wen Xuan*: “About to depart, he returned once more to take leave,” where Li Shan’s commentary states, “‘诀’ is the same as ‘决.’” Here, *决* means *诀*—method. The son memorized his father’s words but could not practice them. When others asked him, he relayed what his father had said. The questioner applied the words and practiced the method, achieving results no different from the father’s. If this is so, why could the dead not transmit the method for living?\n\n**[Annotation]**\nSome things can be spoken but not practiced, while others can be practiced but not spoken—such are the differences in talent and nature.\n\n**[Explanation]**\nSome claim that certain methods are false, arguing that one may merely expound empty words to debate principles without personally practicing or verifying them, thus doubting the truth of their teachings. This passage, therefore, speaks of those who possess knowledge, those who possess knowledge but cannot practice it, and those who can practice but do not possess knowledge. Thus, knowing without practicing, practicing without knowing, or neither knowing nor practicing—though all may attain awakening—are not without distinction. Moreover, those who hear the teaching and put it into practice, gaining understanding through knowledge—are they not superior to those who do not comprehend the words?\n\nThe people of Handan presented doves to Jianzi on the first morning of the first month. Jianzi was greatly pleased and richly rewarded them. A guest asked the reason.\n\nJianzi said, \"Releasing creatures on the first morning of the new year demonstrates benevolence.\" The guest replied, \"The people, knowing that you wish to release them, *compete to capture them*—thus many die. If you truly wish to preserve their lives, it would be better to forbid the people from capturing them at all. To capture and then release them is a benevolence that cannot compensate for the harm done.\"\n\nJianzi said, \"You are right.\"\n\n**Explanation:** When people know how to perform good deeds, they focus only on superficial acts. If one addresses the root, though few may understand, the benefit far exceeds that of tending to the branches. Thus, small acts of kindness are but thieves of true benevolence. The traces of moral teachings attend to the branches; the power of the Great Dao attends to the root. Most people see only the small and fail to recognize the great—hence this example of releasing doves is given to clarify this grand principle.\n\nThe Tian clan of Qi performed ancestral rites in their courtyard, hosting a thousand guests. During the feast, someone presented fish and geese. The patriarch sighed and said, \"How generous is Heaven toward the people! It cultivates the five grains and brings forth fish and birds for their use.\" The guests echoed his words in unison.\n\nBao’s son, twelve years old, was among the attendants. He stepped forward and said, \"It is not as you say. Heaven and earth, the myriad things, and we ourselves are born together as the same kind. There is no nobility or baseness among kinds—only self-regard that leads to mutual disdain. It is merely by differences in size and strength that they dominate one another, devouring each other in turn. They are not born for one another’s sake. Humans take what is edible and eat it—was it truly Heaven’s intent to create them for human consumption? Moreover, mosquitoes and gnats pierce our skin, tigers and wolves devour flesh—was it Heaven’s intent to create humans for mosquitoes and gnats, or flesh for tigers and wolves?\"\n\n**Explanation:** That creatures of prey consume one another extinguishes Heaven’s principle—how could this be Heaven’s will? Bao’s son spoke rightly to the heart of the matter. There was once a vulgar scholar who claimed that Fuxi invented nets and traps, and Suiren cooked meat for food. Yet these two emperors were sages—how far are sages from tigers that eat flesh? The sutras of the Buddha are not like the teachings of China’s sages, which restrain people for their benefit. The Buddha possesses the six penetrations, while the sages’ teachings restrain perception for the sake of liberating sentient beings. Now, the *Liezi* once again clarifies this principle—thus the teachings of the Great Dao have never differed.\n\nA poor man in Qi was accustomed to begging in the marketplace. The townspeople, weary of his frequent appeals, gave him nothing. He then went to the Tian clan’s stables, where he worked alongside the stablehands and borrowed food. Someone in the capital mocked him, saying, \"To eat by serving the stablehands—is this not shameful?\" The beggar replied, \"There is no greater shame in the world than begging.\"\n\nThe beggar said, \"If even begging is not shameful, how could serving the stablehands be shameful?\" The note explains: he did not consider working for the stablehands a disgrace. This chapter illustrates that when things reach their extreme, divisions are already fixed, and thus all sense of honor and shame is lost—how much more so for those who naturally level gain and loss?\n\nThe commentary states: There are scholars who break their limbs or lick sores to gain advancement, all for the sake of clothing and food. Those who labor at the gates of lowly physicians also seek clothing and food. If they gain much profit, they consider it honor; if little, they consider it shame. Yet who among people truly understands the reality of honor and shame?\n\nQin Enfu notes: In the commentary, \"breaking limbs\" refers to \"breaking branches.\" Mencius says, \"To break a branch for an elder.\" Zhao Qi’s annotation explains: \"Breaking branches means massaging the joints to relieve fatigue.\"\n\nThere was a man from Song who, while traveling on the road, found a discarded wooden tally. The note explains: \"discarded\" means abandoned. Wang Chongmin observes: The *Taiping Yulan* (499) omits the character \"traveling.\" The tally was a notched piece of wood used to record matters. He took it home and hid it, secretly counting its teeth. The note explains: the notches resembled teeth. Wang Zhong comments: According to the note, the \"tally\" here refers to the carved notches, synonymous with \"engraving.\" Yang Bojun notes: The matching parts of a tally are its teeth, used to verify authenticity. The *Yilin* states: \"The left tally matches the right, their teeth aligning.\" Thus, upon finding the tally, the man secretly counted its teeth. He told his neighbor, \"I shall soon be rich!\" The note explains: Those who use empty names to seek real gain are like holding a discarded tally to claim wealth.\n\nThe commentary states: Ordinary people, deluded by empty names and losing sight of truth, are all like picking up a lost wooden tally, counting its notches to await riches. They are also like those who feel no shame in begging in the marketplace yet feel shame in serving others. How is this different from a runaway slave abandoning his master to serve another? The labor is no different, yet he believes himself no longer bound to anyone. Following deluded emotions while losing true principle—such is the nature of all these cases.\n\nThere was a man with a withered parasol tree. His neighbor, an elder, said that withered parasol trees were inauspicious. Yang Bojun notes: The *Lüshi Chunqiu* (*Qu You* chapter) uses \"good\" instead of \"auspicious.\" The neighbor hastily chopped it down. The note explains: Though his words were fair, he spoke out of place. Yu Yue argues: The character \"neighbor\" is superfluous. Above, it says \"a man had a withered parasol tree,\" and here it says \"his man,\" referring to this same person. The \"neighbor elder\" mentioned throughout refers to this man’s neighbor—how could it then refer to the neighbor as \"this man\"? Below, it says, \"The man was displeased, saying...\"—also without the character \"neighbor,\" proving that \"neighbor\" here is extraneous. The neighbor elder then asked to take it as firewood. The note explains: He further treads a dubious path. Wang Shumin observes: The *Liu Tie* (16) omits the character \"man,\" and the current text’s \"man\" may be an interpolation from the surrounding text. The *Lüshi Chunqiu* (*Qu You* chapter) also omits \"man.\" The man was displeased, saying, \"The neighbor elder merely wanted firewood and thus urged me to cut it down. Living beside me, how treacherous he is—how can this be?\" The note explains: In doubtful matters, things cannot be trusted.\n\nThe commentary states: Urging him to cut the tree was a fair suggestion; asking for it as firewood was reasonable. Yet urging its felling while requesting it raised suspicions of ulterior motives. Thus it is said: What people fear, one must fear. Do not think it harmless—its misfortune will grow. This is what it means.\n\nThere was a man who lost his axe. The note explains: \"axe\" refers to a hatchet. He suspected his neighbor’s son. Yang Bojun notes: There should be a \"man\" after \"neighbor,\" as below it also says \"neighbor’s son,\" and the *Taiping Yulan* (763) renders it as \"neighbor’s son,\" though it omits \"of,\" the character \"man\" is not missing. He observed the son’s gait—he had stolen the axe; his complexion—he had stolen the axe; his speech—he had stolen the axe; his movements and demeanor—nothing did not suggest he had stolen the axe. The *Sibu Congkan* edition omits \"gait.\" Wang Chongmin notes: The *Taiping Yulan* (763) renders \"movements and demeanor\" as \"demeanor and movements,\" which is correct. Below, it says, \"Another day, he saw his neighbor’s son again, and his demeanor and movements no longer resembled those of an axe thief.\" Yang Bojun notes: The *Lüshi Chunqiu* (*Qu You* chapter) also uses \"demeanor and movements.\" Wang’s observation is correct. Here, following Lu Chongxuan’s edition and the *Daozang Sijie* edition for emendation. The *Shiwen Leiju* (Bieji 18) and *He Bi Shilei* (Xuxi 33) also use \"demeanor and movements.\" Soon after, he dug in his valley and found his axe. Another day, he saw his neighbor’s son again. Wang Shumin notes: The *Taiping Yulan* (763), *Jizuan Yuanhai* (55, 59), *Shiwen Leiju* (Bieji 18), and *He Bi Shilei* (Xuxi 33) all omit the character \"man.\" His demeanor and movements no longer resembled those of an axe thief.\n\nHis demeanor and movements no longer resembled those of an axe thief.\n\n**Note:** When the mind is biased and deluded, it shifts and alters with one’s thoughts and intentions. In extreme cases, white and black become indistinguishable, square and round merge in form—how could this be a change in external things? Thus, the saying goes: the myriad affairs, tangled and confused, all arise from the mind.\n\n**Exegesis:** Many misfortunes stem from doubts and resemblances. Even the fall of a kite or a mouse may breed suspicion and disaster. Only those who accumulate virtue, uphold the Dao, and remain impartial and selfless can avoid such calamities. The case of losing an axe and suspecting a neighbor is but one example.\n\n**Note (variant):** The phrase *\"how could this be a change in external things\"* appears in the *Daozang Sijie* edition as *\"how could external things have the power to change them?\"*\n\n**Phonetic Gloss:** *fù* (復), *fúyòu* (扶又) cut.\n\nWhen Viscount Bai of Shen plotted rebellion,\n\n**Note:** *Lǜ* (慮) means \"to consider\" or \"to scheme,\" here referring to plotting rebellion.\n\n**Phonetic Gloss:** *shèng* (勝), *shīzhèng* (詩證) cut.\n\nhe left court and stood, leaning on his staff upside down, its spike piercing his chin.\n\n**Note:** *zhuì* (錣) refers to the pointed tip of a staff.\n\n**Pei Jun’s Note:** The *Hanfeizi* (*Yu Lao* chapter) reads: *\"He left court, inverted his staff, and its spike pierced his chin.\"*\n\n**Phonetic Gloss:** *zhuì* (錣), *zhāngliè* (張劣) cut. Xu Shen’s commentary on the *Huainanzi* states: *\"A horse whip has a sharp iron tip to prod a horse that refuses to advance.\"*\n\nBlood flowed to the ground, yet he was unaware. A man of Zheng, hearing of this, said: *\"If one can forget one’s chin, what else could one not forget?\"*\n\n**Note:** In the Northern Song edition and the *Shide Tang* edition, *\"chin\"* (頤) appears as *\"head\"* (頭).\n\nWhen the mind is fixated, one’s steps may stumble over roots or pits,\n\n**Phonetic Gloss:** *zhǔ* (屬), *zhú* (烛) sound. *zhuó* (著), *zhíluè* (直略) cut. *zhì* (踬), \"to stumble.\" *kǎn* (埳), \"pit.\"\n\none’s head may strike a wooden post, yet one remains oblivious.\n\n**Pei Jun’s Note:** The passage *\"When the mind is fixated...\"* also appears in the *Huainanzi* (*Yuandao Xun*).\n\n**Phonetic Gloss:** *dǐ* (抵), *dīnglǐ* (丁礼) cut.\n\nLong ago, a man of Qi coveted gold. At dawn, he dressed and went to the market. Arriving at the gold vendor’s stall, he seized the gold and left.\n\n**Phonetic Gloss:** *yìguān* (衣冠), both in departing tone. *yù* (鬻), *yù* (育) sound.\n\nThe authorities arrested him and asked: *\"With people all around, why did you seize another’s gold?\"*\n\n**Wang Chongmin’s Note:** The *Leiju* (83), *Taiping Yulan* (810), and *Lüshi Chunqiu* all include the word *\"reason\"* (故) after *\"why\"* (何). The *Huainanzi* (*Fanlun Xun*) reads *\"why\"* (何故) as *\"what\"* (何也).\n\n**Wang Shumin’s Note:** The *Liushitie* (8), *Shilei Fu* (9), *Jizuan Yuanhai* (1, 55), *Shiwen Leiju Xuxi* (25), and *Tianzhong Ji* (50) all include the word *\"reason\"* (故).\n\n**Phonetic Gloss:** The text reads: *\"Why did you seize another’s gold?\"* (子攫人之金何故), with a variant omitting *\"reason\"* (故).\n\nHe replied: *\"When I took the gold, I saw no one—only the gold.\"*\n\n**Note:** The chaos wrought by craving and desire upon the human heart is this severe. Thus, the ancients said: *\"One who examines the tip of an autumn hair cannot see the form of Mount Tai; one who tunes the harmony of the five notes cannot hear the sound of thunder. When the mind is ensnared by the myriad things and attached to externals, even great forms and sounds may be overlooked. How much more so for one whose heart strays from principle, who restrains emotions and gathers thoughts, abiding in tranquil stillness—how could the movements of the myriad things disturb them?\"*\n\n**Exegesis:** Zhang Zhan states: *\"The chaos wrought by craving and desire upon the human heart is this severe. Thus, it is said: 'One who examines the tip of an autumn hair cannot see the form of Mount Tai; one who listens to the harmony of the five notes cannot hear the sound of thunder.' When the mind is fixed on something, the body may be forgotten—all such cases are like this.\"* This chapter speaks of the great harm in indulging desires, which can destroy the body and extinguish one’s nature. Now, one seeks to enrich the self with that which destroys it. If one could be without self, what need would there be for gold? To speak of being without self is not to destroy the self, but merely not to indulge it.\n\n**Note:** In the *Daozang Sijie* edition, the word *\"thus\"* (因) appears after *\"how\"* (豈), likely in error.\n\n**Lu Wenchang’s Note:** The word *\"thing\"* (物) in the note may be superfluous.\n\n**Pei Jun’s Note:** Lu’s suggestion is uncertain. It is likely that *\"the movements of the myriad things\"* (萬物動之) should read *\"the movements of the myriad things\"* (萬物之動), with *\"movements\"* (動) and *\"of\"* (之) transposed.\n\n**Phonetic Gloss:** *zhuó* (著), *zhíluè* (直略) cut. *bó* (泊), *hún* (魂) sound, meaning \"tranquil and composed.\"",

      "translated_text": "*The Collected Annotations on the Liezi by Yang Bojun*\n*Volume One: \"Heavenly Portents\" (Chapter One)*\n\n[Annotation] Though vast and minute intermingle in disorder, though length of life and nature differ, even within the greatness of Heaven and Earth and the multitude of all beings—all that falls within the realm of living existence and enters the domain of activity and function—undergoes transformation between existence and decay as the natural tally of things. Only that which abides in absolute quiescence, ultimate emptiness, and undivided unity without change lies beyond the cycles of yin and yang or the revolutions of the four seasons.\n\n[Exegesis] Among all moving things, none fails to take life as its master. Yet they cherish life without understanding the principle of life begetting life. That which undergoes generation and transformation possesses form; that which begets life is without image. What has form is called \"thing\"; what is without image is called \"spirit.\" Its traces may be employed, akin to yin and yang. But when one discusses its true nature, it lies beyond the reckoning of yin and yang. Thus, the *Yijing* states: \"That which yin and yang cannot fathom is called *shen*.\" Is this not the great numinous portent at the heart of Heaven and Earth? Hence, it is called \"Heavenly Portents.\"\n\nThe *Explanations of the Text* note: *Fu* (夫) is pronounced *fú*, serving as the opening of a statement; this pronunciation is not repeated thereafter. *Chuǎn* (舛) is read as *chǎngyǎn*. *Fèn* (分) is read as *fúwèn*; the same applies below.",

      "translated_text": "Liezi—[Annotation:] Placing \"Zi\" before the surname indicates that the opening chapter may have been recorded by his disciples. *Shiwen* notes: Adding \"Zi\" to the surname signifies his status as a teacher.\n\nHe dwelt in the gardens of Zheng. [Annotation:] Zheng possessed the Pu Fields. *Shiwen* notes: *Pu* is pronounced *bǔ*. The Pu Fields were the marshes of Zheng, now located in Zhongmou County of Xingyang. Bo Jun observes: The Pu Fields of Zheng are also written as \"Fu Fields\" in the *Book of Songs*, *Zuozhuan*, and *Erya*. Today, the Zhangba Ditch and nearby lakes in southwest Zhongmou County, Henan, are their remnants.\n\nFor forty years, no one recognized him. [Annotation:] Without form, he did not engage with things; without speech, he did not interact with them. Those unaware of his utmost virtue were as if they did not know him at all. The character \"無\" (*wú*) here follows the *Shide Tang* edition and the *Four Explanations*; the same applies below. *Shiwen* notes: \"無\" is sometimes written as \"亡.\"\n\nThe lord of the state, ministers, and grandees regarded him as one of the common people. [Annotation:] He did not isolate himself from things; rather, his words were free of right and wrong, his conduct left no trace, so things could not comprehend him. *Xíng* (行) is pronounced *xià* in the lower tone. The state suffered insufficiency. [Annotation:] A year of famine. He was to \"marry out\" to Wei. [Annotation:] To leave one’s home is called *jià* (嫁). [Explanation:] \"Insufficiency\" refers to a year of famine. *Jià* means \"to go.\"\n\nHis disciples said: \"Master, you depart without a set time for return. Your disciples dare to make a request—[Explanation:] *Yè* (谒) means \"to request.\" *Shiwen* notes: *Yè* means \"to request.\"—what teachings will you leave us? Have you not heard the words of Master Huqiu Zilin?\" [Annotation:] Huqiu Zilin was Liezi’s teacher. *Shiwen* notes: Huqiu Zilin—*Sima Biao’s Commentary on the True Scripture of Southern Florescence* states his name was Lin, a native of Zheng.\n\nLiezi laughed and said: \"What words could Master Hu have? [Annotation:] The four seasons proceed, the myriad things are born—do these depend on words? As the *Lunyu* records Confucius saying: 'What does Heaven say? The four seasons proceed, the myriad things are born—what does Heaven say?' Yet the Master once spoke to Bohun Maoren. *Shiwen* notes: *Yǔ* (語) is also written as *zhào*; *zhào* means \"to inform.\" *Mào* (瞀) is pronounced *mòhóu*; later, \"Bohun Wu Ren\" is also read as *móu*. I overheard it and shall try to tell you. [Annotation:] Bohun was Liezi’s friend, a fellow student under Master Hu. Not saying he received instruction directly from Master Hu reflects Liezi’s humility. Lu Wenchang notes: In Zhang’s annotation, \"Liezi’s humility\" may have an erroneous \"者\" (*zhě*) instead of \"言\" (*yán*). *Shiwen* notes: *Nǚ* (女) is pronounced *rǔ*.\n\nHis words were: There is *sheng* (生, arising)—[Annotation:] The present clod-like form. *Shiwen* notes: *Kuài* (块) is pronounced *kòuduì*.—yet not *sheng* (生, self-arising). [Annotation:] That which gives life to things yet does not arise itself. There is *hua* (化, transformation)—[Annotation:] The present state of existence, decay, change, and alteration.—yet not *hua* (化, self-transformation). [Annotation:] That which transforms things yet does not transform itself. [Explanation:] Not arising from things, not being transformed by things, it thus gives life to all living beings and transforms all transformations.\n\nThat which does not arise can give life to life. [Annotation:] That which does not arise is fundamentally the origin of living things. That which does not transform can transform transformation. [Annotation:] That which does not transform is fundamentally the master of transforming things. That which arises cannot but arise; that which transforms cannot but transform. [Annotation:] That which arises does not arise by its own power; that which transforms does not transform by its own power—it simply cannot but arise, cannot but transform. [Explanation:] All that has life must die; that which is transformed by things is ever-changing. How can it be without arising and perishing, without transformation and change? Thus, it is ever-arising, ever-transforming. [Annotation:] Those who enter the realm of movement and existence cannot be without it for a moment. That which is ever-arising and ever-transforming arises at all times and transforms at all times. [Annotation:] Arising and transformation follow one another; existence and decay alternate without cease—this principle is uninterrupted. Lu Wenchang notes: The characters \"復往\" (*fùwǎng*) in the annotation should be corrected according to later text.\n\nIt is yin and yang, it is the four seasons—[Annotation:] Yin and yang, the four seasons—things of change and transformation that yet belong to the realm of arising—all follow this shaping and movement. The four seasons change without ceasing; the myriad things transform without rest. [Explanation:] Those shifted by yin and yang and turning with the seasons are all things of form. Moment by moment they change; life and death are endless. Thus, they are ever-arising and ever-transforming. The character \"節\" (*jié*) after \"四時\" (*four seasons*) in all editions is deleted here following the *Four Explanations*.\n\nThat which does not arise is doubtfully solitary. [Annotation:] The master of non-arising—how can it be verified in reality? It is doubtfully darkly unified, without beginning or end. [Explanation:] The spirit has no direction or comparison; thus, it is called solitary. As Laozi says: \"It stands alone and does not change.\" \"Doubtfully\" means not daring to speak decisively to clarify the profound and wondrous. The annotation \"不生之主\" (*master of non-arising*) in all editions is written as \"不生之生\" (*arising of non-arising*).\n\nThat which does not transform goes and returns. *Shiwen* notes: *Fù* (復) is pronounced *fú* in the standard reading; later instances not pronounced follow the entering tone. Going and returning—its bounds cannot be exhausted. [Annotation:] Alternation is uninterrupted; form and qi succeed one another—its Dao does not end. The *Shide Tang*, *Zang*, and *Northern Song* editions do not repeat the characters \"往復\" (*going and returning*).",
      "overlap_context": " true nature, it lies beyond the reckoning of yin and yang. Thus, the *Yijing* states: \"That which yin and yang cannot fathom is called *shen*.\" Is this not the great numinous portent at the heart of Heaven and Earth? Hence, it is called \"Heavenly Portents.\"\n\nThe *Explanations of the Text* note: *Fu* (夫) is pronounced *fú*, serving as the opening of a statement; this pronunciation is not repeated thereafter. *Chuǎn* (舛) is read as *chǎngyǎn*. *Fèn* (分) is read as *fúwèn*; the same applies below.",

      "translated_text": "Lu Wenchao said: \"The two characters 'going and returning' (*wangfu*) should be repeated.\" Tao Hongqing said: Zhang’s annotation—\"Alternation is uninterrupted; form and qi succeed one another\"—precisely explains the meaning of \"going and returning,\" indicating that the version he saw was not in error. Wang Chongmin said: The arguments of Lu and Tao are both correct. The Jifu edition correctly repeats the two characters \"going and returning.\" Bo Jun notes: Wang’s view is correct. Here, we follow the Jifu edition and add the repetition.\n\n\"Doubtfully solitary, its Dao cannot be exhausted.\" [Annotation:] How could one know whether it is exhaustible or not? One simply doubts its standing alone and not changing, its circling without peril. [Explanation:] The four seasons transform without end; the spirit’s function in change also cannot be exhausted.\n\nTao Hongqing said: \"Doubt\" means \"to halt.\" The *Erya* explains: \"Doubt (*yi*) means *li* (戾).\" Guo’s annotation says: \"*Li* means to halt. 'Doubt' also means to halt.\" The *Poem* \"Sang Rou\" says, \"There is nowhere to halt in doubt,\" and Xunzi’s *Jiebi* chapter says, \"with nothing to halt in doubt\"—both pair \"doubt\" with \"halt,\" showing they share the same meaning. Here, \"doubtfully solitary\" means halting in solitude. This aligns with the *Daodejing*’s \"Heaven attains the One and becomes clear; Earth attains the One and becomes tranquil.\" Zhang’s \"standing alone and not changing\" precisely captures its essence. To gloss \"doubt\" as \"doubtful hesitation\" is to impose a meaning based on superficial resemblance, which is mistaken.\n\nXu Weiyu said: \"Doubt\" should be read as *ni* (拟), meaning \"to usurp\" or \"to compare.\" The *Guanzi*’s \"Junchen\" chapter says: \"Within the palace, if there are concubines who rival the wife, this is palace disorder; among the commoners, if there are sons who rival the heir, this is family disorder; in the court, if there are ministers who rival the prime minister, this is state disorder.\" (The *Lüshi Chunqiu*’s \"Zhidu\" chapter and the *Shenzi*’s \"Neipian\" have similar passages.) The *Hanfeizi*’s \"Shuoyi\" chapter writes \"doubt\" as *ni*. The *Hanshu*’s \"Shihuo Zhi\" says, \"Those from distant lands who can *ni*,\" and Yan Shigu’s annotation reads, \"*Ni* is read as *ni*.\" These serve as evidence. Here, \"doubtfully solitary\" means \"comparable to solitude,\" forming a paired meaning with the following \"going and returning.\"\n\nZhongfu said: \"End\" (*qiong*) and \"exhaust\" (*qiong*) rhyme, both belonging to the *dong* rhyme group in ancient pronunciation.\n\n*Shiwen* notes: \"*Dai* (殆) is pronounced *dai*.\"\n\nThe *Book of the Yellow Emperor* says: Hui Dong said: This was recorded by Laozi. Laozi’s learning was likely based on the Yellow Emperor, hence the Han dynasty’s term \"Huang-Lao.\" *Shiwen* notes: The Yellow Emperor’s surname was Gongsun, his given name Xuanyuan. He attained the Dao of longevity and reigned for a hundred years. According to the *Hanshu Yiwenzhi*, there were four chapters of the *Book of the Yellow Emperor*, one chapter of *The Yellow Emperor and His Ministers*, and six chapters of *Inscriptions of the Yellow Emperor*, all classified under Daoist works.\n\nBo Jun notes: In the current *Yiwenzhi*, *The Book of the Yellow Emperor* is titled *The Four Classics of the Yellow Emperor*, and *The Yellow Emperor and His Ministers* is ten chapters. Ban’s self-annotation says: \"Originated during the Warring States period, similar to Laozi.\" There are also fifty-eight chapters of *Miscellaneous Writings of the Yellow Emperor*, with Ban’s self-annotation: \"Composed by worthies of the Warring States period.\"\n\n\"The valley spirit does not die,\" [Annotation:] This book existed in ancient times but is now lost. The valley is empty yet contains a dwelling, much like Zhuangzi’s \"ring center.\" Utterly empty and without substance, it is called the valley spirit; inherently without arising, it is said not to die.\n\nBo Jun notes: This is the sixth chapter of the *Laozi*.\n\n\"This is called the Mysterious Female.\" [Annotation:] The *Laozi* contains this chapter. Wang Bi’s commentary says: \"Without form or shadow, without opposition or resistance, abiding in lowliness without movement, guarding stillness without decline—through this the valley is perfected yet its form is unseen. This is the supreme entity. Dwelling in lowliness and beyond naming, it is called the Mysterious Female.\"\n\nYu Zhengxie said: \"Female\" (*pin*) was understood by the ancients as a ravine or valley; the so-called \"empty female\" is akin to what we now call a hollow cavity. Zhu Xi’s *Yulei* says: \"The female is merely the receptive aperture in wood, like a mortise. The Mysterious Female is the most wondrous female, not the same as that particular female.\" His words seem to approach yet depart from the meaning. Upon deep reflection, *yuan* (元) in the *Baihu Tong*’s \"Wuxing\" chapter means \"to enter darkness.\" Thus, *yuan* signifies entering the female. The *Shiwen* of the Tang *Lü*’s \"Weijin Shang\" explains: \"That which has an aperture and can receive entry is called the female.\" That *yuanpin* was an ancient expression is thus evident. To make this explicit is to spare Confucians further discussion.\n\nBo Jun notes: The *Laozi* passage Zhang’s annotation cites—\"hence it is called the Mysterious Female\"—in the current Wang Bi edition reads, \"hence it is called the root of Heaven and Earth.\" *Shiwen* writes \"without shadow\" as \"without *jing*\" (景), and notes: \"*Pin* is pronounced *piren*. *Jing* is read as *ying*.\"\n\n\"The gateway of the Mysterious Female is called the root of Heaven and Earth. Subtly continuous as if existing, its use is inexhaustible.\" [Annotation:] Wang Bi said: \"The gateway is the means by which the Mysterious Female operates. Tracing its origin, it shares the same body as the Great Ultimate, hence it is called the root of Heaven and Earth. Does one wish to speak of its existence? Yet its form is not seen.\"",

      "original_text": "故生物者不生，化物者不化。 〔注〕庄子亦有此言。 向秀注曰：吾之生也，非吾之所生，则生自生耳。 生生者岂有物哉？ 故不生也。 吾之化也，非物之所化，则化自化耳。 化化者岂有物哉？ 无物也，故不化焉。 若使生物者亦生，化物者亦化，则与物俱化，亦奚异于物？ 明夫不生不化者，然后能为生化之本也。 〔解〕此神为生之主，能生物化物，无物能生化之者。 王叔岷曰：注「故不生也。 」「故」上疑捝「无物也」三字。 「无物也，故不生也」与下文「无物也，故不化焉」相对而言。 释文云：向秀，向音饷，字子期，晋常侍，注南华真经二十八篇。 自生自化，自形自色，自智自力，自消自息。 〔注〕皆自尔耳，岂有尸而为之者哉？ 仲父曰：色力息为韵，古音同在职德部。 谓之生化形色智力消息者，非也。 」〔注〕若有心于生化形色，则岂能官天地而府万物，赡群生而不遗乎？ 〔解〕神之独运，非物能使； 若因情滞有同物生化，皆非道也。 俞樾曰：「谓」当作「为」，古书「谓」「为」通用，说详王氏引之经传释词。 上文云「自生自化，自形自色，自智自力。 自消自息」，故此云「为之生化形色智力消息者非也」。 张湛注上文云，「皆自尔耳，岂有尸而为之者哉」，正得其义。 陶鸿庆曰：俞氏平议读谓为为，非也。 谓读如道德经「同谓之元」之谓，此言万物根于无形，无形则无名，而强为之名者非矣。 下文子列子曰「非其名也」，注云，「事有实着，非假名而后得也」，正合此旨。 读谓为为，义反浅矣。 伯峻案：注「赡群生而不遗乎」，「赡」藏本、宋本、四解本皆作「瞻」，释文世德堂本皆作「赡」，作「赡」者是也。 说文「瞻，临视也」。 又新附，「赡，给也。 」孟子公孙丑篇注云：「赡，足也。 」此当训给训足。 又「遗」，释文及世德堂本作「匮」，作「遗」者是也。 其意谓若有心生化，则必有所偏； 今官天地府万物而无所遗失，则知是自生自化，非被生被化。 俞读谓为为，其义较顺。 陶驳疑未审。 释文「智」作「知」，「遗」作为「匮」，云：知音智，下同。 赡，时艳切。 匮音馈，竭也。 子列子曰：「昔者圣人因阴阳以统天地。 〔注〕天地者，举形而言； 阴阳者，明其度数统理。 〔解〕夫有形之物，皆有所生以运行之； 举其所大者，天地也。 运天地者，阴阳也。 阴阳，气之所变，无质无形； 天地因之以见生杀也。 阴阳易辩，神识难明，借此以喻彼，以为其例，然后知神以制形，无以有其生也。 夫有形者生于无形，〔注〕谓之生者，则不无； 无者，则不生。 故有无之不相生，理既然矣，则有何由而生？ 忽尔而自生。 忽尔而自生，而不知其所以生； 不知所以生，生则本同于无。 本同于无，而非无也。 此明有形之自形，无形以相形者也。 注「谓之生者则不无」，「无」世德堂本作「死」，盖因「无」「死」形近，又涉生字义而误。 则天地安从生？ 〔注〕天地无所从生，而自然生。 〔解〕天地，形之大者也。 阴阳者，非神识也。 有形若生于无形者，天地岂有神识心性乎？ 若其无者，从何而生耶？ 假设此问者，将明万物者有生也。 注「而自然生」御览一引作「自然而生」。 故曰：有太易，有太初，有太始，有太素。",
      "translated_text": "Thus, that which gives life does not itself live, and that which transforms does not itself transform.\n\n**[Annotation]** *Zhuangzi* also contains this saying. Xiang Xiu’s commentary states: My life is not something I myself give life to—life simply arises of itself. How could that which gives life to life be a thing? Thus, it does not live. My transformation is not something things transform—transformation simply transforms of itself. How could that which transforms transformation be a thing? It is no-thing, and thus does not transform. If that which gives life were itself to live, and that which transforms were itself to transform, then it would transform along with things—how would it differ from them? Only by being neither born nor transformed can it serve as the root of life and transformation.\n\n**[Exegesis]** This spirit is the master of life, able to give life to and transform things, while nothing can give life to or transform it.\n\nWang Shumin notes: In the annotation, \"Thus, it does not live\" likely omits three characters above *gu* 故 (\"thus\"), reading: \"It is no-thing, and thus does not live,\" to parallel the following: \"It is no-thing, and thus does not transform.\"\n\n**[Pronunciation Notes]** Xiang Xiu: *Xiang* is pronounced *Xiang* (as in *xiang* 饷), courtesy name Ziqī, Jin dynasty Attendant-in-Ordinary, who annotated twenty-eight chapters of the *True Scripture of Southern Florescence*.\n\nLife arises of itself, transformation occurs of itself, form takes shape of itself, color appears of itself, wisdom emerges of itself, strength manifests of itself, dissolution happens of itself, and cessation comes of itself.\n\n**[Annotation]** All these occur spontaneously—how could there be an agent that enacts them?\n\nZhongfu observes: *Color* 色, *strength* 力, and *cessation* 息 rhyme, sharing the same ancient sound in the *zhi-de* rhyme group.\n\nTo call it the giver of life, transformation, form, color, wisdom, strength, dissolution, and cessation would be mistaken.\n\n**[Annotation]** If one were to harbor intent regarding life, transformation, form, or color, how could one govern heaven and earth, store the myriad things, and provide for all beings without omission?\n\n**[Exegesis]** The spirit moves alone, unconstrained by things. If, bound by emotion, one were to equate it with the life and transformation of things, this would not be the Dao.\n\nYu Yue states: *Wei* 谓 (\"to call\") should be *wei* 為 (\"to be\"), as *wei* 谓 and *wei* 為 are interchangeable in ancient texts, as explained in Wang Yinzhi’s *Exegeses of Classical and Historical Words*. The preceding text reads: \"Life arises of itself, transformation occurs of itself, form takes shape of itself, color appears of itself, wisdom emerges of itself, strength manifests of itself, dissolution happens of itself, and cessation comes of itself.\" Thus, this should read: \"To *be* the giver of life, transformation, form, color, wisdom, strength, dissolution, and cessation would be mistaken.\" Zhang Zhan’s annotation to the preceding text—\"All these occur spontaneously—how could there be an agent that enacts them?\"—correctly captures its meaning.\n\nTao Hongqing states: Yu Yue’s *Pingyi* (\"Level Discussions\") reading of *wei* 谓 as *wei* 為 is incorrect. *Wei* 谓 here follows the usage in the *Daodejing*: \"Those of the same *wei* 謂 are called obscure,\" meaning that the myriad things root in the formless, and the formless has no name—thus, to forcibly name it would be mistaken. The following passage, where Liezi states, \"It is not their name,\" with the annotation, \"Things have tangible reality, not merely names by which they are known,\" aligns precisely with this principle. Reading *wei* 謂 as *wei* 為 renders the meaning shallow.\n\nBo Jun notes: In the annotation, \"provide for all beings without omission,\" the *Zang* 藏, *Song* 宋, and *Four Exegeses* editions all write *zhan* 瞻 (\"to gaze\"), while the *Shiwen* 世德堂 edition of the *Pronunciation Notes* writes *shan* 赡 (\"to provide\"). The latter is correct. The *Shuowen* defines *zhan* 瞻 as \"to look down upon,\" while its later supplement defines *shan* 赡 as \"to supply.\" The *Mengzi* *Gongsun Chou* chapter’s annotation glosses *shan* 赡 as \"sufficiency.\" Here, it should mean \"to supply\" or \"to suffice.\" The character *yi* 遗 (\"omission\") in the *Pronunciation Notes* and *Shiwen* edition is written as *kui* 匮 (\"exhaustion\"), but *yi* 遗 is correct. The meaning is: if one were to harbor intent regarding life and transformation, there would inevitably be bias. Now, governing heaven and earth and storing the myriad things without omission shows that these arise and transform of themselves, not through being given life or transformed. Yu Yue’s reading of *wei* 謂 as *wei* 為 yields a smoother meaning. Tao’s refutation is unfounded.\n\n**[Pronunciation Notes]** *Zhi* 智 is written as *zhi* 知 (\"wisdom\"), and *yi* 遗 is written as *kui* 匮 (\"exhaustion\"). *Shan* 赡 is pronounced *shi yan* 時艷. *Kui* 匮 is pronounced *kui* 馈, meaning \"exhaustion.\"\n\nMaster Liezi said: \"In ancient times, the sages relied on yin and yang to govern heaven and earth.\"\n\n**[Annotation]** Heaven and earth refer to form in general; yin and yang clarify their measures, order, and governance.\n\n**[Exegesis]** All things with form have that which gives them life and moves them. The greatest of these are heaven and earth. That which moves heaven and earth is yin and yang. Yin and yang are transformations of qi, without substance or form. Heaven and earth manifest life and death through them. Yin and yang are easy to distinguish, but the spirit’s discernment is difficult to clarify. Using these as analogies for that establishes the pattern, revealing that the spirit governs form, and nothing gives life to it.\n\nThat which has form is born from that which has no form.\n\n**[Annotation]** To call it \"born\" is not to say it is not without; to call it \"without\" is not to say it is not born. Thus, the mutual non-birth of being and non-being is a principle that is already so—how then could being arise? It suddenly arises of itself. Arising suddenly of itself, it does not know why it arises. Not knowing why it arises, its arising is fundamentally identical to non-being. Fundamentally identical to non-being, yet it is not non-being. This clarifies that the self-arising of form does not rely on the formless to give it form.\n\n**[Annotation]** In \"To call it 'born' is not to say it is not without,\" the *Shiwen* edition writes *wu* 無 (\"without\") as *si* 死 (\"death\"), likely due to the graphic similarity of *wu* 無 and *si* 死, compounded by the semantic association with *sheng* 生 (\"life\").\n\nThen how could heaven and earth arise?\n\n**[Annotation]** Heaven and earth have no source from which they arise—they arise naturally.\n\n**[Exegesis]** Heaven and earth are the greatest of forms. Yin and yang are not spirit or discernment. If that which has form were born from that which has no form, would heaven and earth possess spirit, discernment, mind, or nature? If they are without these, from what could they arise? This hypothetical question aims to clarify that the myriad things have that which gives them life.\n\n**[Annotation]** In \"they arise naturally,\" the *Taiping Yulan* quotes this as \"they arise of themselves.\"\n\nThus, it is said: There is the Great Simplicity, the Great Beginning, the Great Inception, and the Great Simplicity.",

In the *Han Shu*, Liu Xiang’s biography reads \"the worthy and unworthy are mixed and confused,\" where *hùn* (浑) is read as *hún* (混), showing that *hùn* and *hún* are interchangeable.\n\n**Great Beginning (太初)** is the inception of qi.\n**[Annotation]** Before yin and yang separate, this is what the following sentence calls \"primordial chaos\" (*hunlun*).\n\n**Great Inception (太始)** is the inception of form.\n**[Annotation]** Once yin and yang have separated, the myriad things flow into form.\n\n**Great Simplicity (太素)** is the inception of substance.\n**[Annotation]** *Zhi* (质) means nature. Once things exist, they possess square or round, hard or soft, still or restless, sinking or floating qualities—each with its own nature.\n\nWhen qi, form, and substance are all present but not yet separated—\n**[Annotation]** This directly discusses qi, form, and substance, no longer mentioning the Great Simplicity. The Great Simplicity is the origin of these three, which will be clarified in the following sentence.\nThe *Lushi Qianji* includes the character \"与\" after \"气.\"\n**[Shiwen]** *Lí* (离) is pronounced *lì* (力智切), meaning \"to separate.\" Some read it in the level tone. \"Near\" is called *lí* (离), \"far\" is called *bié* (别); the rest may be inferred by analogy. *Bié* (别) is pronounced *bǐngliè* (彼列切).\n\n—it is called **primordial chaos (浑沦)**.\n**[Shiwen]** *Hún* (浑) is pronounced *hún* (魂), *lún* (沦) is pronounced *lún* (论), and the same applies below.\n\n**Primordial chaos (浑沦)** means the myriad things are intermingled yet not separated.\n**[Annotation]** Though they form a single undifferentiated qi without dispersion, the Dao of the Three Powers is already latent within it. *Lún* (沦) is a grammatical particle.\n**[Shiwen]** *Sàn* (散) is pronounced *sǎn* (先汗切), and the same applies throughout the volume.\n\nIt cannot be seen, heard, or grasped by tracing—hence it is called *yi* (易).\nWang Chongmin notes: *Xún* (循) should be read as *tún* (揗). The *Shuowen* defines *tún* as \"to rub.\" The *Han Shu*’s *Annals of Emperor Gao* reads, \"thereupon he patted his back,\" with Yan Shigu’s annotation: \"*Fǔ* (拊) means to rub and stroke.\" Later, *fǔtún* (拊揗) was written as *xún* (循). Examples include the *Shiji*’s *Hereditary House of Jin*: \"Zifan gathered the remaining troops, patting and encouraging them to fight again,\" and the *Han Shu*’s *Biography of Zhao Chongguo*: \"patting and soothing to harmonize and unite.\" *Tún* is the original character; *xún* is the loan character.\n**[Shiwen]** *Xún* (循) is pronounced *xún* (旬).\n\nThe *Yi* has no form or boundary—\n**[Annotation]** The character following this is unknown. Laozi says, \"That which cannot be seen is called *xi* (希),\" while here it is called *yi* (易). *Yi* is another name for simplicity and subtlety.\nThe meaning of the Great Simplicity is thus: it serves as the origin of all transformations, remaining obscurely unified and unchanging.\n**[Annotation]** In the Northern Song edition, \"埒\" is written as \"□\"; Wang’s edition also writes \"□.\" Here, it is corrected following the *Sijie* edition.\n**[Shiwen]** \"埒\" is written as \"□,\" noting: The *Huainanzi* writes \"form and boundary,\" meaning signs and omens. The *Qianzao Du* writes \"form □.\" The current reading follows the character *hū* (乎), which is considered an error.\nRen Dachun notes: The *Huainanzi*’s *Benjing Xun* reads, \"Qi coalesces to transform things, forming boundaries and categories,\" with Gao You’s annotation: \"*Liè* (埒) means form.\" The *Yaolüe Xun* reads, \"signs of form and boundary,\" the *Muzheng Xun* reads, \"those with chapters, form, and boundary,\" and the *Binglüe Xun* reads, \"those with form and boundary are publicly visible in the world.\" In all cases, *liè* (埒) is written as *liè* (埒). The *Shuowen*, *Yupian*, and *Guangyun* include *liè* but not *□*; the *Leipian* includes *□*, defining it as \"to raise earth while plowing,\" sharing the same meaning as \"the king plows once.\" *Liè* (埒) and *□* have different meanings; *liè* written as *□* is a loan character.\nJing Shun’s *Shiwen* states: \"Now following *hū* (乎) is considered an error.\" Examining the *Huainanzi*’s *Yaolüe Xun*: \"Yínghū (嬴垀) embodies the nature of being and non-being,\" where the *Leipian* defines *hū* (垀) as *liè* (埒)—this is what Jing Shun refers to as \"following *hū*.\" The meaning of *hū* (垀) is the same as *hū* (乎), and *liè* (埒) derives from *hū* (乎), so the meaning is naturally coherent. Yet Jing Shun calls it an error—his reasoning is unclear.\n\nThe *Yi* transforms into the One—\n**[Annotation]** The so-called *yi* is profound and indistinct, beyond transformation. Qi relies on it to transform, so it is provisionally named \"transformation.\"\nThe *Taiping Yulan* quotes the annotation with \"恃\" written as \"持.\"\n**[Shiwen]** *Huǎng* (恍) is written as *huǎng* (怳), noting: From the One through the Nine, these are the numbers of the *Dayan*.\n*Hū* (惚) is pronounced *hū* (忽). *Huǎng* (怳) is pronounced *kuàngwǎng* (况往切).\n\n—one transforms into seven, seven transforms into nine. Nine transformations are the culmination.\n**[Annotation]** *Jiū* (究) means \"to exhaust.\" The transformation from one to seven and nine does not follow sequential numbers; rather, it fully presents the yang numbers to encompass their convergence.\nHu Huaichen notes: Zhang’s annotation is not entirely clear.

Originally, it read: \"Nine is the culmination of *qi* transformation, which then reverts to one.\" Due to the influence of the preceding phrase \"one transforms, seven transforms,\" it was mistakenly written as \"nine transformations,\" rendering the wording redundant.\n\nSun Yirang says: This chapter aligns with the text of the *Qian Zaodu* in the *Weft of the Changes*. In the *Weft*, \"Nine is the culmination of *qi* transformation\" corresponds precisely with the subsequent phrase \"One is the beginning of form transformation.\" In this text, the character *bian* (变) was erroneously transposed above *zhe* (者), and the two characters *qi zhi* (气之) were omitted.\n\nWang Chongmin says: Sun’s interpretation is correct. The *Taiping Imperial Encyclopedia* cites it as \"Nine transformations are the culmination,\" which also contains errors. The edition consulted by the *Imperial Encyclopedia* had already omitted the character *qi* (气) and, influenced by \"one transforms, seven transforms,\" mistakenly moved *bian* (变) above *zhe* (者). Later scholars, deeming *zhi* (之) redundant, arbitrarily deleted it. Fortunately, the preserved *zhi* (之) in the citation suffices to prove that the original text of the *Liezi* matched that of the *Weft of the Changes*. Yu Yue’s claim that *bian* (变) is superfluous is incorrect.\n\nWang Shumin says: Sun’s interpretation is correct. The *Dharma Garden Pearl Forest*, Volume 7, cites it as \"Nine is the culmination of transformation,\" omitting only the character *qi* (气). The *Shiwen* writes *nai* (乃) as *nai* (乃), noting: *Nai* (乃) is an ancient form of *nai* (乃).\n\nOne is the beginning of form transformation.\n**[Annotation]** Once entering the realm of form, principle and number mutually evolve, proceeding from one to nine. When the nine numbers reach their end, they revert to one. Reverting to one returns to the beginning of form transformation. This illustrates that transformations and changes recur endlessly without limit.\n\nWhat is pure and light ascends to become Heaven.\n*(The *Shiwen* notes: \"Ascends\" is pronounced *shízhǎng* (时掌切).)*\n\nWhat is turbid and heavy descends to become Earth.\n**[Annotation]** What are Heaven and Earth? They are simply the self-differentiation of emptiness and fullness, purity and turbidity.\n\n*(The *Wen Xuan* commentary on Pan Anren’s \"Western Expedition Rhapsody\" cites \"pure and light\" and \"turbid and heavy\" as \"light and pure\" and \"heavy and turbid.\")*\n\nWhat is harmonious *qi* becomes Human.\n*(The *Wen Xuan* commentary on the \"Western Expedition Rhapsody\" cites this as \"harmonious *qi*.\")*\n\nTao Hongqing says: *Chong* (冲) should be read as *zhong* (中). The *Nine Safeguards* chapter of the *Wenzi* states: \"Thus, the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors had vessels of admonition called *youzhi*, whose *chong* (冲) was upright; when full, they overturned.\" *Chong* (冲) here means *zhong* (中). Furthermore, the *Sincerity* chapter reads: \"Grasping the *chong* (冲) and embracing harmony,\" while the *Tai Zu* chapter of the *Huainanzi* writes *chong* (冲) as *zhong* (中), both demonstrating the interchangeability of *chong* (冲) and *zhong* (中). This aligns with the preceding \"ascends to become Heaven, descends to become Earth,\" forming a coherent meaning. *Zhonghe qi* (中和气) refers to dwelling in the center of harmonious *qi*. The *Superior Virtue* chapter of the *Wenzi* states: \"The myriad things bear yin and embrace yang, with harmonious *qi* residing in the center,\" which conveys the same meaning.\n\nThus, Heaven and Earth contain essence, and the myriad things transform and come into being.\n**[Annotation]** Extending this reasoning, when yin and yang *qi* universally intermingle and harmonize, harmonious *qi* gives rise to human life. Human life thus has a foundation upon which to stand.\n\n**[Exegesis]** One, three, five, seven, and nine are the numbers of yang. When they reach their extreme, they revert to one, circulating endlessly. The *Book of Changes* states: \"That which is rooted in Heaven inclines upward; that which is rooted in Earth inclines downward.\" What inclines downward comprises grasses and trees; what inclines upward comprises sentient beings. Thus, animals possess spirit, while plants lack consciousness. Those without consciousness are transformed by *qi*; those with spirit are shifted by consciousness. Hence, it is said: From *Taiyi* and *Taichu* to *Hunlun*, this describes the gradual progression of *qi*. Within it, the most refined and essential is called *shen* (spirit). Those with refined and subtle *shen* and *qi* become worthy or sagely; those with mixed and turbid *shen* and *qi* become ordinary or foolish. Even among living beings, distinctions abound, resulting in manifold classifications.\n\nZhongfu says: The *Appended Judgments* of the *Book of Changes* states: \"When male and female unite their essence, yin and yang transform and give birth.\"\n\n*(Bo Jun notes: The *Exegesis* cites the *Book of Changes* from the *Wenyan* commentary. Additionally, *jing* (精, essence) and *sheng* (生, birth) rhyme, both belonging to the ancient *geng-qing* rhyme group.)*",
      "overlap_context": "\"to exhaust.\" The transformation from one to seven and nine does not follow sequential numbers; rather, it fully presents the yang numbers to encompass their convergence.\nHu Huaichen notes: Zhang’s annotation is not entirely clear.

All things have what they can and cannot do.\" This conveys the same idea, though expressed differently, hence their conclusions diverge.)*\n\n*(The *Exegesis* states: *Zào* is pronounced *qī dào*, *hé* sounds like *ài*, and *shǔ* sounds like *zhú*.)*\n\nWhy is this so? That which gives life and cover cannot shape and bear; that which shapes and bears cannot teach and transform; that which teaches and transforms cannot defy what is proper—*(Annotation: Following it brings penetration.)*—and what is fixed in propriety does not transgress its position.\n*(Annotation: All have their inherent divisions, which cannot be reversed.)*\n*(Bo Jun notes: There appears to be a missing \"can\" before \"does not transgress its position,\" making \"cannot transgress its position\" parallel to the preceding three \"cannot\" clauses.

These all follow what is proper and cannot transgress their positions.\n*(Annotation: Stillness and movement, square and round—principles cannot be combined. Yet when examining forms and affairs, their divisions cannot encroach upon one another. When following the penetration of principle, square and round need not conflict. Thus, the virtue of the Two Modes and the Dao of the sage nurture and sustain all life, pervading the myriad things, exhausting only their purity, tranquility, integrity, and essence. Then, divergent paths merge, movement and stillness become one—this arises from the sage not opposing the natures of the myriad things, and the myriad things not violating the sage’s transformative influence. All that is fixated on one direction is obstructed by its form’s divisions. The operation of the Dao is ever profoundly penetrating and without dependence.)*\n\n*(Annotation: The movement of qi enables covering and bearing; the movement of spirit enables teaching and transformation. Thus, Heaven and Earth give life to the myriad things, and the sage employs them according to their forms.)*\n\nZhongfu notes: In the annotation, *jìng zào* (\"stillness and movement\") is cited in the *Qunshu Zhiyao* as *jìng zào* (\"tranquility and movement\").\n\n*(The *Exegesis* states: *Dào* is pronounced *dǎo*, meaning \"to cover\"; *cuì* sounds like *suì*.)*\n\nThus, there are those that are born, and those that give birth; there are those that have form, and those that give form; there are those that have sound, and those that give sound; there are those that have color, and those that give color; there are those that have flavor, and those that give flavor.\n*(Annotation: Form, sound, color, and flavor all arise in an instant yet cannot generate themselves. That which cannot generate itself is the root of non-action. The root of non-action has no attachment to a single image, no bond to a single flavor—thus it can be the master of form and qi, and all movement must proceed from it.)*\n\n*(Annotation: The beginning of having form is called \"birth\"; that which can give birth to this birth is called \"form and spirit.\" That which can form its form, sound its sound, color its color, and flavor its flavor—all are the work of spirit, using the insubstantial to govern the substantial.

The beginning is without duration.\" Transformation occurs thus: *Mozi*’s *Jingshuo Shang* reads: \"The beginning (phrase).

When pulled, it regrows joint by joint, hence the name *xu*.\" Some write it as *duan* (\"broken\") or *xuduan* (\"teasel\"), but *xu* may have been mistaken for *duan*, and later generations erroneously added \"continuing.\" *Xu* resembles *xuduan* but is distinct from the *xuduan* that grows in mountain valleys. As it regrows joint by joint without roots anchoring to soil, it is called water *xi*, aligning with the text’s \"obtains water and becomes *xu*.\"\n\nThe *Shiwen* notes: *Xu* is pronounced *ji*. Sima Biao states: Though all things bear signs, only when they receive the moistening qi of water do they successively arise.\n\nWhen it obtains the boundary of water and soil, it becomes the covering of *pin*.

The *Bencao* reads: \"Also called water discharge\" (i.e., water *xi*). Tao’s commentary: \"Leaves narrow and long, growing in clusters in shallow water.\" Su Song’s *Tu Jing*: \"Leaves resemble *niushecao* (plantain), single and long; in autumn, it blooms white flowers in clusters, resembling *gujingcao* (pipewort). Roots are harvested in late autumn and dried.\" Here, \"obtaining the intersection of water and soil,\" it develops roots that can be harvested.\n\nMa Xulun states: The *Erya*’s \"Explaining Plants\" reads: \"*Tan*, stone covering.\" Hao Yixing states: \"*Tan* and *tai* (moss) are phonetically interchangeable. The *Shuowen* reads: '*Pi*, water covering.' *Pi* is moss. Water covering is stone covering, also called fish covering.\" The *Zhouli*’s \"Hairen\" reads: \"The additions to the *bian* vessels include *pi* pickles.\" Zheng Zhong’s commentary: \"*Pi* is the fish covering in water\" (based on the early Zheng’s explanation; the character should be *pi*; later Zheng wrote *chi*, thus interpreting it as arrow sprouts. Modern *Zhouli* editions write *pi*, likely a later conflation of *pi* and *chi* into one character. However, the covering of *pin* is fish covering). *Pin*—the *Shuowen* writes it as *pin*; the *Erya*’s \"Explaining Fish\" writes it as *bi*; the *Shanhai Jing*’s \"Western Mountains\" writes it as *□*. The *Shuowen* reads: \"*Ping*, steps, then.\" *Bi* is borrowed for *bi* (*bivalve*); *bi* is clam.\n\nThe *Shiwen* reads: *Pin* is pronounced *bu tian*. Sima Biao states: The roots of things lie at the water-soil boundary, spreading in water; viewed from above the water, they are unseen, but when scooped, they can be obtained—like stretched silk in water. The people of Chu call this the covering of *pin*.\n\nBo Jun’s note: The modern *Zhuangzi Shiwen* writes \"scooped\" as \"pressed.\"\n\nWhen it grows on a mound, [Note] *Ling tun* (\"mound\") refers to a high and pure place.\n\nThe *Shiwen* writes *jie* (\"pure\") as *jie* (\"knotted\"), noting: *Tun* is pronounced *tun* (piglet), meaning mound. *Chu* (\"place\") is pronounced *chang ju*; the same below.\n\nIt becomes *ling xi*.

The straight path is *dangdao*, both aligning with \"grows on a mound.\"\n\nThe *Shiwen* notes: *Ling xi* is pronounced *xi* (past); also called marsh *xi*, changing with dryness and moisture.\n\nBo Jun’s note: This also cites Sima’s text.\n\nWhen *ling xi* obtains *yuqi* (fertile soil), it becomes crow’s foot.

Though now commonly called *xie*, their habitats differ.\" Its leaves become butterflies.\n\n[Note] The root is the origin; the leaves are the dispersion. This means *wuzu* is the origin of *qicao*, and its dispersed form transforms into butterflies. The note’s \"its dispersed\" (*qi wei*) appears as \"its not yet\" (*qi wei*) in the Northern Song edition; Wang’s edition follows this, but the present text adopts the *Sijieben* correction.\n\nThe *Shiwen* reads: *Die* is pronounced *ye*, referring to the butterfly. *Jia* is pronounced *jia*. *Hudie* (butterfly) is *xu*.\n\n[Note] *Xu* means \"all,\" indicating that all things transform. Transforming into insects, Yu Yue says: \"‘*Xu ye*’ should be read with the following clause, originally stating, ‘*Hudie xu ye hua er wei chong*’ (butterflies all transform into insects), paralleling the later phrase ‘*Quduo* after a thousand days becomes a bird.’ ‘A thousand days to become a bird’ denotes a long duration; ‘all transforming into insects’ denotes swiftness.\"\n\nThe *Shiwen* notes: According to Master’s teaching, *xu* means \"brief,\" referring to a short span of time. Born beneath the stove,\n\nThe *Shiwen* reads: Generated by warmth. Its form resembles *tuo*,\n\nThe *Shiwen* reads: *Tuo* is pronounced *thekuo*. Guo’s commentary to the *Erya* states, \"*Tuo* means to shed skin.\" It is called *quduo*.\n\n[Note] This refers to transformations within a single form.

Li Yi says, \"*Mo* is the fluid in the mouth.\" *Simi* is the name of an insect. *Simi* becomes *shixi yilü*.\n\nThe *Shiwen* reads: *Xi* is pronounced *xixi*, referring to vinegar gnats, also called *xiji* (vinegar flies), as below. *Yilü* is pronounced *zhilu*. *Shixi yilü* is born from *shixi huanghuang*,\n\nThe *Shiwen* reads: *Huang* is pronounced *kuang*. *Yilü* and *huanghuang* are both insects. *Shixi huanghuang* is born from *jiuyou*.\n\nYu Yue says: The eight characters \"*Yilü shixi huanghuang shixi*\" are superfluous. *Zhuangzi*’s \"Perfect Joy\" chapter reads only, \"*Yilü* is born from *shixi*, *huanghuang* from *jiuyou*,\" omitting these eight. Wang Shumin says: Yu’s claim is incorrect. This passage should be punctuated as \"*Simi wei shixi yilü*\" (a complete clause), \"*Shixi yilü sheng hu shixi huanghuang*\" (another clause), and \"*Shixi huanghuang sheng hu jiuyou*\" (a third clause). The *Taiping Yulan* (887) quotes *Zhuangzi* with the four characters \"*huanghuang shixi*\" still intact above \"*huanghuang sheng hu jiuyou*.\" This should follow the *Liezi* to supplement *Zhuangzi*, rather than using *Zhuangzi*’s corrupted text to delete from the *Liezi*.\n\nThe *Shiwen* reads: Li says, \"*Jiu* should be *jiu* (long-lasting); *jiu* means old. *You* is the name of an insect.\" *Jiuyou* is born from *maorui*.\n\nZhu Junsheng says: *Maorui* is the same as *rui*. *Mao* and *rui* are phonetic alternations. The *Shiwen* reads: *Mao* is pronounced *mao* or *mou*. *Rui* is pronounced *rui*, a small insect fond of swarming in disorder. *Maorui* is born from *fuxuan*.\n\n[Note] These all refer to a single form that revives after death. The *Shiwen* reads: *Fu* is pronounced *fu*. *Xuan* is pronounced *quan* or *huan*, referring to the yellow beetle in melons.\n\nSheep’s liver transforms into *digao*.\n\nBo Jun notes: Liu Rulin once told me that \"*Digao*\" should be \"*digao*\" (earth’s fat), as *gao* (fat) and *xue* (blood) are often paired; thus *digao* is *dixue* (earth’s blood). The *Shuowen* and *Erya Yi* state that *rulü* (madder) grows from human blood, hence its alternate name *dixue*. The *Bencao* records that *qian* root can dye crimson, also called *dixue*. Ancient people, observing that *qian* root could produce red dye, thus believed it arose from animal fat and blood.\n\nHorse blood transforms into *zhuinlin*.\n\nHu Huaichen says: The character \"*zhuan*\" (transform) likely belongs above \"*wei*\" (becomes), reading \"*zhuan wei lin*\" to parallel the earlier \"*hua wei digao*.\"\n\nThe *Shiwen* reads: *Gao* is pronounced *gao*. Gu Yin’s *Hanshu Jijie* states, \"Like stagnant mud *lin*,\" with *lin* written as *lin* or *lin*, all referring to ghost-fire. The *Huainanzi* says blood becomes *lin*. Pronounced *lin*.\n\nHuman blood transforms into *yehuo*.\n\n[Note] These all refer to spontaneous transformations within a single form.\n\nThe sparrow hawk transforms into the goshawk,\n\nThe *Shiwen* reads: *Yao* is pronounced *yao*. *Zhan* is pronounced *zhan*. The goshawk transforms into the cuckoo,\n\nThe *Shiwen* writes \"*bugu*\" and notes: Also written as \"*gu*.\" Lu Ji’s *Maoshi Bird and Beast Gloss* states, \"The goshawk resembles the sparrow hawk, with yellow feathers, a sparrow hawk’s head, and a gray body; it flies swiftly, preying on doves, pigeons, swallows, and sparrows. *Bugu* is *jieju*, also called *shijiu*, *jigu*, or *chengjiu*.\" In mid-spring, sparrows, sparrow hawks, eagles, and goshawks transform into *ju*. *Ju* is pronounced *ju*.",

      "translated_text": "\"Ru is pronounced *ru.*\n\nBo Jun notes: The current edition of the *Shuowen* under the *zhui* radical reads '□,' stating, '□ belongs to the *ru* category.' This differs from the edition Jingshun consulted.\n\nRotten melons transform into fish. The *Shiwen* writes '朽' as '□,' noting: □ is pronounced *xiu.*\n\nOld leeks transform into amaranth. The *Shiwen* writes '苋' as '莞,' noting: *Jiu* (leek) is pronounced *ju you.* *Guan* (莞) is pronounced *guan,* resembling cattail but round—what is now used for mats. Yang Chengqing’s *Zitong* reads it as *guan,* while another version writes it as *xian,* pronounced *hou bian*—a transcription error. Ren Dachun states: In Li’s *Commentary on the Book of Changes,* '苋陆夬夬,' Yu Fan says, '苋 means joy. *Xian* is read as in *Confucius’ xian er* (苋尔) when he laughed.' The *Shiwen* on the *Changes* notes: '苋, three schools read it as *qi lian* (期练), one version writes it as *guan.*' The *Shiwen* on the *Analects* notes: '*Xian er* (苋尔) is pronounced *hua ban,* now written as *guan er.*' In the *Chu Ci’s* *Yufu,* '*guan er*' is also written as '*xian er,*' hence *guan* and *xian* are interchangeable. The *Guanzi’s* *Diyuan* chapter states: 'Leaves descend to *□,* which is *yu.* *□* descends to *xian,* and *xian* descends to *pu.*' The *Shanguo Gui* chapter says, 'There are lands of *guan* and *pu.*' The *Da Dai Liji’s* *Quanxue* chapter states, '*Guan* and *pu* grow there.' Thus, *xian* and *guan* are both akin to *pu,* so old leeks become *guan,* and *guan* is also written as *xian.*\n\nOld ewes transform into apes. [Note:] *Yu* (羭) refers to female sheep. The Northern Song edition and the Zang edition write '牝' as '牡,' while the Shidetang edition writes it as '牝.' According to the *Shuowen:* 'In summer, the female sheep is called *yu.*' Duan’s commentary cites Yan Shigu’s note on the *Jijiu Pian:* '*Yu* is the female of summer sheep.' Thus, writing it as '牝' is correct. The *Shiwen* notes: *Yu* is pronounced *yu,* referring to female sheep or black sheep. *Yuan* (ape) is pronounced *yuan.*\n\nFish eggs transform into insects. [Note:] These all transform naturally without external influence. Wang Shumin states: There should be a '也' after '虫' to match the syntax of the preceding text. The *Taiping Yulan* (887) quotes the *Zhuangzi* with the '也' included. The *Shiwen* notes: *Luan* (卵, egg) is pronounced *lai duan.*\n\nThe beasts of Dan-Yuan conceive and bear offspring by themselves, called *lei.* [Note:] *Dan* is pronounced *chan.* The *Shanhaijing* states: 'On Dan-Yuan Mountain, there is a beast resembling a leopard with hair, named *lei,* which reproduces by itself as both male and female.' Lu Wenchang notes: The annotation 'with hair' in the *Shanhaijing* reads '髦.' Ren Dachun states: Guo Pu’s commentary on the *Shanhaijing* notes, '髦 may also be written as *fa.*' Thus, the current edition’s *mao* (髦) written as *fa* (发) follows Guo’s note on the alternate form. The *Shiwen* writes '发' as '髦,' noting: *Dan-Yuan,* the first is *chan,* the second is *yuan.* *Li* (狸) is pronounced *li zhi.* *Mao* (髦) is pronounced *mao,* meaning hanging hair. *Pin* (牝) is pronounced *pi ren.* *Mu* (牡) is pronounced *mou.*\n\nThe birds of rivers and marshes conceive by gazing, called *yi.* [Note:] These conceive by mutual gaze. The *Zhuangzi* states: 'White *yi* gaze at each other, their pupils unmoving, and the wind transforms them.' Bo Jun notes: The annotation cites the *Zhuangzi’s* *Tianyun* chapter. The two characters '之也' are absent in the current edition and were likely added by Zhang Zhan. The *Shiwen* notes: *Yi* (鶂) is pronounced *wu li.* The *Sancang* states: *Cang* (鸧) is *yi.* Sima Biao states: It refers to fledglings. *Mou* (眸) is pronounced *mou.*\n\nPure females are called *da;* pure males are called *zhi* bees. [Note:] *Da* refers to creatures like turtles and soft-shelled turtles. *Zhi* means small. These transform without male or female. The preceding discusses the principles of insects and beasts; the following clarifies that the human Dao also has such cases. Huang Chengji states: '蜂' is interchangeable with '锋.' *Feng* (锋) means edge or momentum. '*Zhi feng*' and '*da*' form a parallel, not the name of an insect. The *Shiwen* notes: *Zhi* is the ancient form of *zhi* (稚). *Feng* (蜂) is pronounced *feng.* Sima Biao states: *Zhi feng* are slender-waisted bees that take mulberry worms, enchant them, and make them resemble their own offspring.\n\nLonging scholars without wives conceive by emotion; longing women without husbands conceive by yearning. [Note:] The *Dahuang Jing* states: 'There is the country of Siyou, where longing scholars have no wives, and longing women have no husbands. Their essence and qi subtly interact, and they bear children without intercourse.' These are akin to the white *yi.* The *Shiwen* notes: *Yun* (孕) is pronounced *yi zheng.*\n\nHou Ji was born from a giant footprint. [Note:] Records state: Gaoxin’s consort, named Jiang Yuan, saw a giant footprint, admired it, and trod upon it. As if moved by a human’s essence, she conceived and bore Hou Ji. Grown and virtuous, he became Yao’s assistant—the ancestor of the Zhou. The *Shiwen* writes '生' as '长,' noting: *Hao* (好) is pronounced *hu bao.* *Zhang* (长) is pronounced *ding zhang.* The annotation is the same.\n\nYi Yin was born from an empty mulberry tree. [Note:] Records state: Yi Yin’s mother lived by the Yi River. After conceiving, she dreamed a spirit told her: 'When mortar water flows out, flee eastward—do not look back!' The next day, she saw mortar water flowing out, told her neighbors, and fled east. After ten *li,* she looked back, and her village was submerged. Her body transformed into an empty mulberry tree. A woman of the Youxin clan, gathering mulberries, found an infant within the hollow mulberry and named him Yi Yin, presenting him to her lord. She ordered a cook to raise him. Grown and virtuous, he became Tang of Yin’s minister.\"",

      "translated_text": "Long bamboo gives birth to *qingning*. [Note:] This arises from forests and marshes. Wang Shumin states: *Taiping Yulan* 887 cites *Zhuangzi* with the repeated phrase \"not sprouting long bamboo.\" The sentence should read: \"Yangxi compared to the non-sprouting long bamboo,\" followed by \"non-sprouting long bamboo gives birth to *qingning*,\" making the structure perfectly clear. Here, above \"gives birth to *qingning*,\" the four characters \"non-sprouting long bamboo\" are likely also omitted. *Shiwen* notes: *Nanhua Zhenjing* connects \"from Yangxi to *qingning*\" as a single sentence. Sima Biao says: Yangxi is the name of a plant, its root resembling turnip; it bonds with long bamboo, both arising from unlike kinds. *Qingning* is the name of an insect.\n\n*Qingning* gives birth to *cheng*. [Note:] From *qing* to *cheng*, all are living things—birds, beasts, insects, and animals—speaking of their ceaseless transformation: some change in form, some die and are reborn, beginning and end following one another without end. *Shiwen* states: *Shizi* says *cheng* is called *leopard* in the Central States and *mo* by the Yue people. According to the *Erya*, bears and tigers are of the same kind, their offspring being leopards. Leopards are the young of bears and tigers. *Shanhaijing* says: Southern mountains abound in *mo* and leopards. Guo’s commentary states: *Mo* is the white variant of leopards; leopards are born of unlike tigers. Thus, *cheng* is another name for *mo*. *Mo* resembles a bear, its fur yellow-black and lustrous. *Mo* is pronounced *mo*. Bo Jun notes: *Erya*’s *Shi Shou* reads: \"Bears and tigers are of the same kind, their offspring being dogs.\" Jing Shun’s citation reads \"their offspring being leopards,\" though the reason is unclear.\n\n*Cheng* gives birth to horses. Shen Kuo says: I have examined textual annotations where \"the Qin people call leopards *cheng*.\" When I arrived in Yanzhou, people still referred to tigers and leopards as *cheng*, likely meaning \"creature.\" Such is the local dialect, perhaps an old custom. Horses give birth to humans. Jiang Chaobo says: These are likely all alternative names for plants and trees, like *heiema* and *mafu*.\n\nHumans, after long, enter the *mechanism*. Wang Shumin says: *Zhuangzi* writes \"long\" as \"again,\" which should be followed. \"Long\" is a miswriting of \"again,\" their forms being easily confused. The following line, \"advancing to the root not long,\" also miswrites \"long\" for \"again.\" The myriad things all emerge from the *mechanism*, all enter the *mechanism*. [Note:] How can the transformations of life and death be fathomed? That which is born here may die there; that which dies there may be born here. Yet the life of forms never ceases for even a moment. Thus, the sage knows life is not eternally preserved, nor death everlasting extinction. The transformations of a single *qi* take ten thousand forms. Though the ten thousand forms undergo ten thousand changes, that which does not change abides in the unchanging—this is called the *mechanism*. The *mechanism* is the origin of all beings, the source of all movement. Thus, from nonbeing it emerges into being, from being it scatters into nonbeing—nothing does not proceed from it.\n\n[Commentary:] Of the kinds of seeds. Does the kind have a category? Or do they mutually give birth? This question is posed to clarify that where the spirit goes, there is life; where the spirit departs, there is death. Forms have no constant master, spirits no fixed form. The spirit has no fixed term, while forms congeal. Once receiving the substance of form, it is as if bound by the *mechanism*: birth is emergence, death is entry. In the note, \"the life of forms\" appears as \"the master of forms\" in the *Sijie* and *Shide Tang* editions. In the commentary, \"posing this question,\" the Qin engraving writes \"kill\" for \"pose,\" here corrected following the *Sijie* edition. Lu Wenchang says: In the note, below \"death is not everlasting extinction,\" the *Zang* edition includes the character \"而.\" The note’s end lacks the character \"也.\" Wang Lai says: In Lu’s commentary, \"of the kinds of seeds,\" above \"seeds\" the character \"几\" should be added.\n\nThe *Book of the Yellow Emperor* states: \"When form moves, it does not give birth to form but to shadow; when sound moves, it does not give birth to sound but to echo.\" [Note:] Where there is form, there must be shadow; where there is sound, there must be echo. These arise naturally and coexist, emerging and vanishing together—how could there be any sequence of dependence or priority? Guo Xiang’s commentary on *Zhuangzi* discusses this in detail. Yet worldly speakers claim that when form moves, shadow follows; when sound issues, echo responds. The sage takes this as a metaphor, clarifying that when things move, they lose their root; when still, they return to it—no longer adhering to the principle of mutual resonance.\n\n[Note:] That being arises from nonbeing relies on nonbeing for its birth. To speak of birth is necessarily through nonbeing, and nonbeing gives birth to being without exception. This function of circulation depends entirely on nonbeing. Thus, the term \"giving birth through movement\" is established in accordance with circumstances.\n\n[Commentary:] Forms, having something from which they are born, cannot give birth to nonbeing—shadows and echoes are examples. The spirit, being formless, when moved gives birth to being—all things are examples. Lu Wenchang says: In the note, below \"and nonbeing gives birth to being without exception,\" the character \"于\" should be added. Bo Jun notes: Lu’s suggestion is unreliable. This states that being is not born of nonbeing, but rather arises from nonbeing. The meaning is perfectly clear; adding \"于\" would obscure it.\n\n[Note:] Form is that which must end. Do heaven and earth end? They end together with me. [Note:] Measuring great and small, calculating long and short, they differ from me.

      "translated_text": "The *Shiwen* notes: \"偕 is read as *jie*. 料 is read as *liao*. Does it advance to an end? One does not know.\"\n\n[Note:] \"Advance\" should be \"end.\" In this text, the character \"尽\" (*end*) is often written as \"进\" (*advance*). When things gather, they form shape; when they scatter, they come to an end—this is what the world calls \"end and beginning.\" Yet when things gather, their beginning lies in solid form, and their end in dispersion; when they scatter, their beginning lies in emptiness, and their end in solid form. Thus they alternately serve as each other’s end and beginning, yet in principle there is truly neither end nor beginning.\n\n[Commentary:] \"Advance\" should be \"end.\" This is a hypothetical question: Does heaven and earth have an end? Or is it unknown? The answer follows. Tao Hongqing says: The two characters \"不知\" (*one does not know*) are meaningless, and the note does not address them—it is likely that \"知\" (*know*) is a corruption of \"始\" (*beginning*). The *Zhuangzi*’s *Lie Yukou* chapter states: \"Return the spirit to the beginningless, and delight in the realm of nothing-whatsoever.\" \"Ending in non-beginning\" is precisely \"returning the spirit to the beginningless.\" Zhang’s note says: \"They alternately serve as each other’s end and beginning, yet in principle there is truly neither end nor beginning.\" Presumably, the text he saw originally read \"不始\" (*non-beginning*). This continues the above: \"I am of the same body as heaven and earth; heaven and earth end together with me. Yet ending is ceasing in non-beginning—if there has never been a beginning, then there has never been an end either.\" Below it states: \"The Dao ends in fundamental non-beginning, advances in fundamental non-being,\" which further elaborates this meaning. Wu Kaisheng parses \"终进乎不知也\" as a single phrase, saying: \"It ends and advances into the unknowable reckoning of reckonings.\" Bo Jun notes: Wu’s interpretation does not accord with the context.\n\nThe *Shiwen* notes: \"进 is read as *jin*, the same below. 漠 is read as *mo*. 迭 is read as *die*.\"\n\nThe Dao ends in fundamental non-beginning, advances in fundamental non-duration.\n\n[Note:] \"久\" (*duration*) should be \"有\" (*being*). Without beginning, there is no end; without being, there is no exhaustion. The Lu Chongxuan edition omits the character \"本\" (*fundamental*) below \"进乎.\" Wang Shumin says: The note \"久 should be 有\" is correct. \"久\" is likely a graphic corruption of \"又,\" as \"又\" was often used for \"有\" in antiquity.\n\nThe *Shiwen* notes: \"久 is read as *you*.\"\n\nThat which has birth returns to non-birth; that which has form returns to formlessness.\n\n[Note:] The born revert to death; the formed revert to emptiness—this is the natural reckoning.\n\n[Commentary:] All things with beginning and end are fundamentally without beginning and return to non-being. Now, speaking from the primordial undifferentiated state, this is having a beginning—how could it not end? How could it not be exhausted? \"That which does not give birth\"—\n\n[Note:] This \"does not give birth\" first had birth, then proceeded to death and extinction.\n\n—is not fundamentally unborn.\n\n[Note:] That which is fundamentally unborn originally had neither birth nor extinction.\n\n\"That which is without form\"—\n\n[Note:] This \"without form\" also first had form, then proceeded to dispersion.\n\n—is not fundamentally formless.\n\n[Note:] That which is fundamentally formless originally had neither gathering nor scattering.\n\nNow, that which gives birth to beings is itself unborn; that which gives form to things is itself formless. Thus it can give form to the myriad things, yet my body undergoes no change. To say that what is already born and formed then reverts to non-birth and formlessness is merely the alternation of existence and extinction—it is not the unchanging principle of beginning and end.\n\n[Commentary:] What is meant by the spirit’s non-birth is not that it was never born. The birth of the myriad things and the formation of all species are all set in motion by the spirit. Because it can give birth to life, its essence is without birth or extinction. This is not the same as the complete absence of form and birth, identical to the qi of the Great Void.\n\nThe *Shiwen* notes: \"而复之复 is read as *fu*.\"\n\nThe born are those whose principle must end. The ending cannot but end, just as the born cannot but be born.\n\n[Note:] The born do not give birth yet are spontaneously born—thus though born, they do not know how they are born. Not knowing how they are born, birth cannot be severed; not knowing how they die, death cannot be warded off. Yet to desire to perpetuate their life and delimit their end is to be deluded by reckoning.\n\n[Note:] \"画\" means *to cease*.\n\n[Commentary:] Things that have birth must have an end, just as when harmonious qi sprouts, plants and trees cannot but grow. Yet to desire that they live forever is to be deluded by the supreme reckoning. Lu Wenchang says: The Zhang edition has \"尽\" (*cease*) for \"画,\" with the note: \"尽 means *to cease*.\" Yu Yue says: \"画\" means *to stop*. In the *Analects*, *Yongye* chapter, \"今女画\" (*now you stop*), Kong’s note says: \"画 means *to stop*.\" \"画其终\" (*delimit its end*) means to stop it from ending. Above it states: \"The born are those whose principle must end\"—thus birth fundamentally cannot be made eternal, and ending fundamentally cannot be stopped. Yet to desire to \"perpetuate their life and delimit their end\"—this is why it is called delusion. Zhang’s note says: \"画 means *to cease*,\" but it likely originally read \"画止也\" (*to stop and cease*), then became corrupted due to graphic similarity. The *Lüshi Chunqiu*’s *Benwei* chapter states: \"The Dao ceases that to rectify the self,\" but today it is mistakenly written as \"止彼在己\" (*stops that to be in the self*), which can serve as mutual proof. Yin Jingshun’s *Shiwen* says: \"画 is also written as 尽,\" but this is a character error. In *Qunshu Shibu*, Lu Wenchang says: \"The Zhang edition has 尽, with the note: 尽 means *to cease*,\" but this is incorrect.\n\nBo Jun notes: Yu’s interpretation is correct. The Zang edition, Northern Song edition, and Lu Chongxuan edition have \"尽,\" but we now follow the Shidetang edition and emend it.\n\nThe *Shiwen* notes: \"画 is read as *huai*, *strategy*.\"",
      "overlap_context": "Lu’s suggestion is unreliable. This states that being is not born of nonbeing, but rather arises from nonbeing.

[Note:] Measuring great and small, calculating long and short, they differ from me.

According to the *Hanshu*, Yang Wangsun said: \"Spirit and essence are Heaven’s *you*; bones and frame are Earth’s *you*.\" Wangsun frequently read this text, and the present edition of the Directorate of Education writes *fen*. Ren Dachun said: \"Modern editions sometimes write *fen*, which is the Directorate of Education edition referred to in the *Shiwen*.\" Examining the *Huainanzi*’s *Jingshen Xun*: \"Thus spirit and essence are Heaven’s *you*, while bones and frame are Earth’s *you*.\" Again, in \"Huozi held to Heaven and Earth,\" Gao You’s commentary states: \"Spirit and essence are Heaven’s *you*; form and frame are Earth’s *you*,\" all following this passage in the *Liezi*. Thus, the versions seen by Han scholars all wrote *you*, not *fen*. Jingshun’s *Shiwen* states that *jiu* should be *you*, which can still be verified in ancient editions. Sun Yirang said: The *Shiwen*’s claim that \"*jiu* should be *you*\" is correct. However, the seal script of *you* does not closely resemble *jiu*. I suspect that the alternate edition consulted by Yin wrote *you* as *you* (又), whose seal form (□) resembles that of *jiu* (□). *You* (又) and *you* (有) were interchangeable in antiquity, so Yin directly identified it as *you*.\n\n\"Bones and frame are Earth’s *fen*.\"\nThat which belongs to Heaven is clear and disperses; that which belongs to Earth is turbid and congeals. When spirit and essence depart from form, each returns to its true origin.\n[Note] That which is Heaven’s *fen* returns to Heaven; that which is Earth’s *fen* returns to Earth, each reverting to its root. Thus it is called *gui*.\n*Gui* means *to return*, to return to its true dwelling.\n[Note] The true dwelling is the realm of the Great Void.\n[Exegesis] When spirit and numinosity depart from form, it is called death. Returning to the true dwelling is reverting to the Great Clarity. Taking the Great Clarity as the true dwelling clarifies that this form and frame are but empty illusion.\n\nWang Chongmin said: Below the second *gui*, the original text included the word *zhe* (者), which is now omitted in modern editions. The *Han Shi Waizhuan* states: \"The dead become *gui*. *Gui* means *to return*.\" The *Lunheng*’s *Lunsi* chapter says: \"When a person dies, their spirit ascends to Heaven, and their bones return to Earth, hence they are called *gui*. *Gui* means *to return*.\" The *Fengsu Tong* states: \"Death is *si* (澌); *gui* means *to return*. Spirit and essence dissipate, while flesh and bones return to the earth.\" In all these cases, *gui* is followed by *zhe*, which confirms this.

By the Spring and Autumn period, it belonged to Lu as a fief of the Meng clan. It lies ninety *li* northeast of present-day Ningyang County in the Tai’an region of Shandong.\n\nClad in a deerskin robe and girded with a hempen rope—Shen Tao remarks: A *deerskin robe* refers to a coarse fur garment, not one made of deer; a *deer cart* denotes a simple cart, not one drawn by deer. The character for \"coarse\" (粗) contains three \"deer\" (鹿), hence *lu* carries the sense of coarseness. The *Lüshi Chunqiu*’s *Guisheng Pian* speaks of Yan He wearing a *deer-cloth robe*, meaning a garment of rough cloth. *Bo Jun* notes: The *Hanfeizi*’s *Wudu Pian* states, \"In winter, a deerskin robe; in summer, ramie clothing—even the attire of a gatekeeper’s servant does not fall below this\" (the original text reads *ni* (麑) for *deer*, but this is corrected following the *Li Si Zhuan* and the *Taiping Yulan*’s citations in chapters 27, 80, and 694). The *Records of the Grand Historian*’s *Autobiographical Afterword* says, \"In summer, ramie clothing; in winter, a deerskin robe.\" The *Huainanzi*’s *Jingshen Xun* states, \"Embroidered silks and fox-fur robes are what people desire, yet Yao concealed his form in plain cloth and wore a deerskin robe against the cold\"—thus, a deerskin robe was winter’s humble garb. *Shiwen* notes: *Suo* (索) is pronounced *sùo* (先各切).\n\nHe strummed his zither and sang.",

      "translated_text": "Confucius asked, \"Master, what is the reason for your joy?\"\n\n*Wang Chongmin* notes: The *Taiping Yulan* (468) cites \"以\" as \"为,\" while the *Yiwen Leiju* (44) renders it \"先生为乐何也,\" with \"以\" likewise as \"为.\" *Shiwen* reads \"以乐\" as \"为乐,\" stating: *Le* is pronounced *luò* (洛), and the same applies below.\n\nHe replied, \"My joys are many. Heaven generates the myriad things, yet only humans are noble—this is my first joy. That I have attained human form is one joy.\n\n**[Note]**: Extending this reasoning, it becomes clear that the *qi* and spirit of humans differ not from those of other beings; only their destinies diverge, hence their forms vary. Thus, Rong Qiqi deeply probed the hidden causes of fortune and misfortune, penetrating the workings of the unseen and manifest. Therefore, he rejoiced in surpassing the forms of others and in attaining the esteemed male form—how could this be mere reckless speech?\n\n*Bo Jun* notes: The *Taiping Yulan* (468) reads \"吾既得为人,\" aligning with the syntax of the following phrases, \"吾既得为男\" and \"吾既己行年九十.\" The *Shuo Yuan*’s *Za Yan* chapter has \"吾既己得为人,\" while the *Kongzi Jiayu* (6) reads \"吾既得为人.\" It is likely that the *Kongzi Jiayu* preserves the correct version.\n\nAs for the distinction between male and female, *Shiwen* notes: *Bie* (别) is pronounced *bǐe liè* (彼列切). Since men are honored and women humbled, the male form is esteemed. That I have attained the male form is my second joy.\n\n**[Note]**: Before birth, whether one becomes male or female is not predetermined, hence the additional joy of attaining a male body.\n\n*Shiwen* notes: *Fen* (分) is pronounced *fú wèn* (扶问切); *fù* (复) is pronounced *fú yòu* (扶又切).\n\nThere are those who do not live to see the sun and moon, who never leave swaddling clothes. *Shiwen* reads \"襁褓\" as \"襁保,\" stating: *Qiǎng* (襁) is pronounced *jū liǎng* (居两切); some versions write it as *qiǎng* (襁). *Bǎo* (褓): The *Bowuzhi* states it is woven from threads, eight *cun* wide and one *chi* two *cun* long, used to secure infants on the back.\n\nThat I have already lived ninety years is my third joy.\n\n*Wang Chongmin* notes: The *Yiwen Leiju* (44) reads \"吾年九十有五矣,\" suggesting that the present *Liezi* text omits \"有五\" after \"九十.\" The *Shuo Yuan*’s *Za Yan* chapter and the *Taiping Yulan* (509), citing the *Shengxian Gaoshi Zhuan*, both read \"九十有五.\" The *Gaoshi Zhuan* likely relied on an older version of the *Liezi*, confirming that \"有五\" originally followed \"九十.\"\n\n*Bo Jun* notes: There are two *Gaoshi Zhuan*: one by Huangfu Mi, whose *Shiquan Lun* in the *Jin Shu*’s *Huangfu Mi Zhuan* states, \"Rong Qiqi’s three joys moved Confucius,\" referring to this passage. The other, by Xi Kang, titled *Shengxian Gaoshi Zhuan*, also includes this figure, as cited in the *Taiping Yulan* (509). The *Yiwen Leiju* (36), citing Sun Chu’s *Rong Qiqi Zan*, draws from pre-Qin and Han texts, not the *Liezi*. Tao Qian’s *Drinking Wine* poem, \"At ninety, he girds himself with rope,\" references this passage, showing that some versions read simply \"九十.\"\n\nPoverty is the constant lot of the scholar; death is the end of all humans.\n\n*Bo Jun* notes: The *Taiping Yulan* (468) reads, \"贫者人之常，死者命之终.\" The *Yiwen Leiju* (44) has, \"贫者士之常，死者生之终.\"\n\nAbiding in this constant and accepting life’s end—\n\n*Lu Wenchang* notes: \"得\" in the *Shuo Yuan*’s *Za Yan* chapter is written as \"待.\"\n\n*Wang Chongmin* notes: \"待\" is correct. Rong Qiqi, content with Heaven’s decree and understanding fate, recognized that poverty is the scholar’s norm and death the end of all humans. Thus, he declared himself at ease with the constant, awaiting life’s end—what cause for sorrow? If written as \"得,\" it would miss the point.\n\nThe *Taiping Yulan* (468) indeed reads \"待.\" The *Yiwen Leiju* (44) has \"居常以待终,\" with minor variations but the same meaning, and the \"待\" is unmistakably correct.\n\n*Bo Jun* notes: Lu and Wang are correct. The following chapter’s Zhang Zhan commentary states, \"Content with Heaven’s decree and understanding fate, he awaited life’s end with equanimity.\" The phrase \"待终\" clearly echoes this passage, showing that Zhang’s version still read \"待.\"\n\n—what cause for sorrow is there?\"\n\n*Bo Jun* notes: \"当\" should be read as \"尚.\" The *Records of the Grand Historian*’s *Wei Gongzi Liezhuan* states, \"If Qin destroys Daliang and razes the ancestral temples of our former kings, with what face could you stand in the world?\" Here, \"当\" should likewise be read as \"尚,\" providing mutual confirmation.\n\nConfucius said, \"Excellent! He is one who can console himself.\"\n\n**[Note]**: Unable to entirely forget joy and sorrow, Confucius praised his ability to reason and find self-consolation.\n\n**[Explanation]**: Just as a great smith casts metal, shaping it to the mold, so too does the spirit form its vessel, giving rise to all shapes. The length of life for men and women is predetermined by yin and yang. Why? The spirit enacts its work, and the form repays it in kind. Since the form cannot comprehend itself, the spirit, though formless, already knows. Qiqi only began to rejoice in his later years, for he came to the Dao late. His emotions remained bound to form, so Confucius merely praised his self-consolation, not his profound grasp of the ultimate Dao.\n\nLin Lei was nearly a hundred years old.\n\n**[Note]**: No records of him exist in transmitted texts; he was likely an ancient recluse.\n\n*Bo Jun* notes: \"且\" means \"将.\" *Shiwen* notes: *Lèi* (类) is pronounced *lèi* (泪); versions writing it as *yǐng* (颍) are mistakenly conflating it with another character.\n\nIn late spring, he wore a fur robe.\n\n**[Note]**: \"底\" means \"当.\" The final \"也\" is added following the *Sijie* edition.\n\n*Bo Jun* notes: The *Shuowen* states: *Qiú* (裘) is a fur garment, with a variant *qiú* (求). *Qiú* (求) depicts the shape of a fur robe, likely the original character. All fur garments are called *qiú*, without distinction of quality. Later writers sometimes used it to denote fine attire, as in the *Lüshi Chunqiu*’s \"In early winter, the Son of Heaven first dons fur robes,\" the *Huainanzi*’s *Fanlun Xun*’s \"The world considers fur robes rare and precious,\" and the *Gongyang Zhuan*’s *Huan 8* commentary, \"Fur and linen are the finest garments for warding off cold and heat.\" These are examples of such usage.",

Living in constant expectation of death, with no sorrow or grief, is why I find such joy.\n\nZigong said: \"Longevity is what people desire; death is what they detest.\n**Bo Jun** notes: The *Hanshu*’s *Biography of Dong Zhongshu* states: \"Desire is what people feel.\" It also says: \"What people feel is called desire.\" The *Hou Hanshu*’s *Biography of Zhang Heng* commentary states: \"Desire is what the nature feels.\" The ancients often paired desire and aversion in parallel, as in the *Lüshi Chunqiu*’s *Lun Wei* chapter: \"People desire life and detest death.\" Thus, *qíng* here should be glossed as *desire*.\nThe *Shiwen* notes: *È* is pronounced *wū lù*.\n\nWhy do you find joy in death?\"\nLin Lei said: \"Death and life are but departure and return. Thus, one who dies here—how do we know they are not born there? **Liang Zhangju** says: The theory of transmigration likely originates here. Therefore, I know they are not unequal.\n**Yu Yue** says: The word *ān* (\"how\") is missing after *wú* (\"I\"). Above, it says \"death and life are but departure and return,\" so it should read \"how do I know they are not equal,\" meaning death and life are one. Below, it says \"how do I know that busily seeking life is not delusion?\"—this directly follows. If it read \"I know they are not equal,\" it would contradict the meaning entirely. Later scribes, seeing two instances of *ān zhī* (\"how do I know\") ending with *hū* (\"?\"), and this one ending with *yǐ* (\"!\"), thought it inconsistent and rashly deleted *ān*. They did not realize *yǐ* functions like *hū*—the difference is merely one of emphasis. Ancient texts often use *yǐ* in place of *hū*; for details, see Wang’s *Jingzhuan Shici*.\n**Wu Kaisheng** argues that *gù* should be read as *gù* (\"certainly\"), meaning \"I certainly know,\" which contradicts Yu’s interpretation. Yu’s view is preferable.\n\nHow do I know that busily seeking life is not delusion? How do I know that my death now is not better than my past life?\"\n**[Note]**: Following this principle, existence and nonexistence alternate endlessly.\n**[Explanation]**: Knowing that form undergoes transformation while spirit knows no death or life—departure and return are like morning and evening.

      "translated_text": "The *Wen Xuan* annotation to Bao Mingyuan’s *Poem on Taking Medicine at the City’s Eastern Bridge* indeed includes the word *zhi*. The *Shiwen* notes: *yu* is pronounced *yǔ*.\n\nZigong heard this and did not grasp its meaning. He returned and reported it to the Master. The *Shiwen* notes: *gao* (\"reported\") is read as *gǔwò*; the same applies below.\n\nThe Master said: \"I knew he could be spoken with—sure enough. Yet what he attained was not yet complete.\"\n**[Note]**: Hearing Lin Lei’s words so abruptly, Zigong believed he had reached the utmost. Yet the Master declared it still incomplete. \"Complete\" means nothing is left unexhausted, nor is anything exhausted—only then is principle wholly fulfilled. Now, when one opposes nonbeing to being, relinquishes that to grasp this, one cannot but sense the difference between inner and outer. Yet what remains incomplete is but a trifling part. As for the myriad transformations returning to the Mysterious One, where self and other are both forgotten, principle naturally levels itself, and in truth nothing is cast aside. When inner and outer merge in darkness and wander freely, becoming one with the multitude—how could there be completeness or incompleteness?\n\n**[Explanation]**: To die here and live there is the inevitable principle. What Lin Lei called \"how do I know\" is merely ambiguous speech, hence the Master said it was not yet complete. In the note, \"darkly within, freely without\" (*ming nei you wai*), the Northern Song edition reads *you* (\"freely\") as *ni* (\"contrary\"); Wang’s edition follows this error. Here, it is corrected according to the *Daozang* and *Shidetang* editions. The *Shiwen* notes: *cu* (\"abruptly\") is read *cāngmò*; *zao* (\"attained\") is read *qīdào*; *qu* (\"relinquishes\") is read *qiūlǚ*; *chu* (\"part\") is read *chāngjù*.\n\nZigong, weary of study, said to Confucius: \"I wish to rest for a while.\"\n**[Note]**: Study is the means to recover one’s original nature, yet when one grows weary of it, the principle of spontaneity is impaired. The *Jinxiu Wanhua Gu* (Qianji 20) and *He Bi Shi Lei* (Qianji 43) read: \"reported to Confucius, saying.\" The *Shiwen* notes: *yan* (\"weary\") is read *yùyàn*.\n\nConfucius said: \"In life, there is no rest.\"\n**[Note]**: Exerting the mind and taxing the limbs—these are the affairs of the living. Zhuangzi said: \"Life is corvée labor.\"\n\nZigong said: \"Then does that mean I have no place to rest?\"\nWang Shumin says: \"Rest nowhere\" (*xi wu suo*) likely originally read \"nowhere to rest\" (*wu suo xi*), following the above phrase \"no rest in life.\" In the present edition, the word *xi* (\"rest\") is mistakenly transposed above \"nowhere.\"\n\nBo Jun notes: Judging from the reply below, \"rest nowhere\" is not in error.\n\nConfucius said: \"There is, of course. Look to the grave mounds—\nThe *Shiwen* notes: *kuàng* is read *kuàng*; it means the burial pit. Xunzi has a chapter by this name.\n—lofty as a high terrace,\nBo Jun notes: The *Xunzi* *Dalüe* chapter reads *gao ru* (\"lofty as\").\nLiu Taigong says: *Yi* (\"lofty\") is the same as *gao* (\"high\").\nWang Niansun says: The *Kongzi Jiayu* *Kunshi* chapter also reads *yi ru*.\nWang Su says: *Yi* means \"tall.\"\nThe *Shiwen* notes: *yi* is read *gāo*.\n—orderly as a chief minister,\nThe *Shiwen* notes: It means \"like the prime minister.\"\n—mounded like a hill,\nLu Wenchang says: *Fen ru* means \"like a great embankment.\"\nThe *Shiwen* notes: It means \"like a grave mound.\"\n—partitioned like a tripod.\"\nHao Yixing says: *Ge ru* likely resembles an inverted cauldron, narrow above and wide below—many such are seen today.\nThe *Shiwen* notes: *ge* is read *lì*; its shape is like a *ding*. It may also be read *gé*.\n\n\"Then you will know where rest lies.\"\n**[Note]**: Seeing the grave’s earthen partitions and wings, one knows rest has its place. Zhuangzi said: \"Death is repose.\"\n\nZigong said: \"How great is death! The noble man rests there; the petty man lies low there.\"\n**[Note]**: Knowing destiny and delighting in Heaven, awaiting the end with equanimity—this is how the noble man rests. Escaping sorrow and suffering, dying in darkness—this is how the petty man lies low.\nBo Jun notes: The *Xunzi* *Dalüe* chapter and *Kongzi Jiayu* *Kunshi* chapter both include this passage.\nThe *Shiwen* notes: *Fu yan* (\"lies low\") in Xunzi reads *xiu yan* (\"reposes\"). *Le* (\"delight\") is read *luò*; the same applies below. *Qu* (\"escaping\") is read *qiūlǚ*; *li* (\"sorrow\") is read *lìzhì*; *mei* (\"darkness\") is read *mèi*.\nWu Kaisheng says: *Xi* (\"rests\") and *fu* (\"lies low\") rhyme; reading *xiu* (\"reposes\") is incorrect.\n\nConfucius said: \"Ci!

It is like the sun’s streaming light—all things move without cease.

Those who indulge in greed and excess, never satisfied—these are the unvirtuous, whose suffering is ceaseless. Only in death do they find rest and repose.\n\nBo Jun notes: This is from the *Yanzi Chunqiu* *Neijian* chapter.\nDeath is the culmination of virtue.\n**[Note]**: *De* means \"attainment\"; *jiao* means \"return.\" It speaks of each attaining its proper return. The ancients called the dead \"those who have returned.\" If the dead are called \"those who have returned,\" then the living are \"those who are traveling.\" To travel without knowing one’s return is to lose one’s home. If one man loses his home, his generation will condemn him; if the world loses its home, none will condemn it.\n**[Note]**: This is the mutual deception of the many and the few. *Yanzi* and the Mohists made their teachings their home, yet those who prized bodily life did not distinguish this—such words are merely attributed to them.\n\n**[Exegesis]**: *Laozi* says: \"Returning to the root is called stillness; stillness is called the restoration of mandate; restoration of mandate is called constancy; knowing constancy is called illumination. Not knowing constancy, one acts recklessly—calamity follows.\" The spirit’s possession of form is but a single term’s recompense. Deluded by the root and clinging to existence, one wearies the spirit and torments the heart—exhaustion reaches its limit. Only in death does one return to the true, like casting off shackles and laying down a burden. Those who cling to life and death, foolishly attached to existence, do not know to return to the root—yet the world does not condemn them as deluded, for such are many.\n\nBo Jun notes: *Zhuangzi* *Qi Wu Lun* says: \"All their lives they toil without seeing success, wearily worn out and not knowing their return—how pitiful!\" This is precisely the meaning here. Also, the present *Yanzi Chunqiu* *Neijian* chapter reads: *Yanzi* said, \"Long ago, the Lord Above regarded man’s passing as good. The virtuous find repose in it; the unvirtuous lie low in it.\" *Liezi*’s quotation differs only in these three lines. The slight variation in the first line reflects how the ancients, when citing texts, did not adhere strictly to the original wording. Considering the placement of this note, it seems to treat all from \"none will condemn it\" onward as *Yanzi*’s words, hence the comment about attribution. Yet *Yanzi* did indeed say this—Chu Du simply had not seen the *Yanzi* text.\n\nIs there a man who leaves his homeland, parts from his six relations, abandons his family’s livelihood, and wanders the four directions without returning—what manner of man is he? The world will surely call him a mad and dissolute man. And is there a man who clings to worldly worth,\n**[Note]**: \"Clinging to worldly worth\" should read \"prizing bodily life.\"\nwho prides himself on skill and ability, cultivates fame and reputation, and vaunts himself before the world, yet does not know himself—what manner of man is he?",

      "translated_text": "The world will surely deem him a man of wisdom and strategy. These two types are both lost men. Though their conduct differs in small ways, neither escapes drowning and ruin.\n\nLu Wenchang: \"Drowning\" should read \"weakness,\" as in the *Zhuangzi*; the same applies below.\nBo Jun’s note: The *Zhuangzi*’s \"Equalizing Things\" states, \"How do I know that hating death is not weakness and ruin, forgetting one’s return?\"—this is Lu’s source.\n\nYet the world approves one and rejects the other. Only the sage knows what to embrace and what to abandon. Those who treat life and death as waking and dreaming are to be embraced; those who drown and forget their return are to be abandoned.\n\nTo abandon the root and chase the branch, to labor the spirit and exhaust the mind—whether following emotions to seek fame or pursuing desires to chase profit—both are lost. What is thick, what is thin? What the multitude calls right, the whole world deems correct; what the common cling to, the whole world deems wrong. Only those who possess the Dao know what to leave and what to take.\n\nThus *Zhuangzi* says: Zang and Gu were both herding sheep, and both lost their sheep. One was absorbed in gambling, the other in reading. Though their good and evil differed, the loss of the sheep was the same. If the Dao is lost, then wandering the world and pursuing learning—how far apart are they?\n\nQin Enfu: In the *Zhuangzi*, when asked what Zang was doing, one said, \"Gambling.\" When asked what Gu was doing, one said, \"Reading.\" Lu’s note adds an extra \"absorbed\" after \"gambling,\" which is likely superfluous.\nBo Jun’s note: Here, *yu* (与) means \"to grant,\" as in the *Analects* (\"I grant that you are not as good\") and the *Zuozhuan* (\"You grant it to him\"). The *Liezi* often uses it to mean \"to take,\" and the meanings are interchangeable. The next chapter states: \"Stillness and emptiness obtain their proper place; taking and granting lose their place.\" Stillness and emptiness are synonymous, so taking and granting are also synonymous. Further, in the *Yang Zhu* chapter: \"Fame is not what reality takes; reality is not what fame grants.\" The interchange of *qu* (取, \"take\") and *yu* (与, \"grant\") confirms this.\n\nSomeone asked Master Liezi: \"Why do you value emptiness?\"\nXu Weiyu: The *Lüshi Chunqiu*’s \"No Duality\" states: \"Master Liezi valued emptiness.\"\nLiezi said: \"Emptiness is not to be valued.\"\nAll valuing arises from preferring this over that, affirming oneself and negating things. Now, with the two forgotten and the ten thousand differences merged into one, this is called emptiness. Since emptiness is empty, where can the names of noble and base arise?\n\nIt is not its name. When affairs are manifestly real, they are not obtained through borrowed names. Nothing compares to stillness, nothing compares to emptiness. Stillness and emptiness obtain their proper place; taking and granting lose their place.\n\nThe principle of emptiness and stillness lies beyond the calculations of the mind and the confines of the body. Seek and obtain it, and it is your nature. When inwardly settled in oneself, one is naturally whole and true. Thus, what preserves things does so through emptiness and stillness, obtaining their place of rest; what ruins them does so through movement and seeking, losing their proper place.\n\nSomeone asked about valuing emptiness. The answer was: \"There is nothing to value. My fondness for emptiness is not for its name. When an empty room gives rise to brightness, auspiciousness comes to rest. Only stillness, only emptiness, obtains its proper place. If one is greedy for taking and granting, the spirit loses its peace. Then names, profits, right and wrong converge in contention—how can one bear it? Thus, emptiness is not what *I* value.\"\n\nWhen affairs are broken and ruined, then one dances with benevolence and righteousness—yet they cannot be restored.\n\nOne should act before things arise and govern before disorder begins. When things are already damaged and decayed, then to drum up benevolence and righteousness in hopes of returning to the utmost of nature and life—this cannot be achieved.\n\nWhat I call emptiness is cultivation before disorder arises. If true nature is broken and ruined, the spirit muddled and confused, then to play with the words of benevolence and righteousness or stir the waves of human emotions—this cannot restore it.\n\nTao Hongqing: Zhang’s note interprets \"dancing with benevolence and righteousness\" as \"drumming up benevolence and righteousness,\" which is incorrect. *Wu* (舞) should be read as in \"dancing with words.\" In the \"Confucius\" chapter, \"to act as if dancing—what will those who come think?\" Zhang’s note interprets *wu* as \"to play with,\" which is correct. It means that after affairs are broken and ruined, one applies benevolence and righteousness to patch them up, yet what is ruined cannot be made whole again. The *Daodejing*’s first chapter states, \"When the great Dao declines, there is benevolence and righteousness.\" The *Zhuangzi*’s \"Horse’s Hooves\" states, \"The sage hobbles for benevolence, limps for righteousness, and the world begins to doubt\"—this is the same idea. The note does not grasp it.",

      "translated_text": "The character *sang* (丧) is pronounced *xilang*. Zhu Xiung states: Liang Zhangju says: Among the various Masters’ texts, the *Yuzi* is the most ancient, yet there are two versions of it. The *Han shu*’s \"Yiwen zhi\" lists twenty-two *pian* of Daoist *Yuzi shuo* and nineteen *pian* of *xiaoshuo* *Yuzi shuo*. The *Liezi* cites *Yuzi* three times, all expounding the Yellow Emperor and Laozi’s teachings on purity and tranquility, which differ from the present text. It is likely that these are the Daoist twenty-two *pian*. Bo Jun notes: The current one-*juan* *Yuzi*, since Ye Mengde of the Song dynasty, has been widely suspected as spurious. The *Siku quanshu zongmu tiyao* suggests it was \"a forgery by later enthusiasts, modeled after the passages cited by Jia Yi,\" which is plausible.\n\nThe *Shiwen* states: *Yu* is pronounced *yu*. Yu Xiong was the teacher of King Wen of Zhou, enfeoffed in Chu, and authored twenty-two *pian* of writings.\n\n\"Revolving without cease\"—the *Shiwen* states: *yi* is pronounced *yi*.\n\"Heaven and earth shift imperceptibly—who perceives it?\"\n\n**[Annotation]** This aligns with the *Zhuangzi*’s \"boat and valley\" passage. Confucius said, \"Day and night without pause, I thus pass away.\" All things embody transformation, and their forms shift with it. Transformation never halts for a moment—how can things remain unchanged? Thus, the form that lived before is not the form that lives now. In the space between a downward and upward glance, ten thousand changes have already occurred. Qi disperses, form decays—not suddenly, but by degrees. Yet the deluded cling to vessels of inevitable change, entrust themselves to ceaseless motion, and claim they can escape transformation. Is this not lamentable?\n\nBo Jun notes: The original text does not separate paragraphs; the division here follows the meaning.\n\nThe *Shiwen* states: *cao* is pronounced *qidao*.\n\n\"Thus, what is diminished there is filled here; what is completed here is depleted there.\"\n\n**[Annotation]** As the saying goes: \"When rivers run dry, valleys empty; when hills level, abysses fill.\" Loss and gain, fullness and emptiness follow the world and accompany death.\n\n**[Annotation]** Here, *shi* (世) should also be read as *sheng* (生).\n\nBo Jun notes: The *Zhuangzi*’s \"Da zongshi\" states, \"Nothing is not destroyed, nothing is not completed,\" which conveys the same idea.\n\nThe *Shiwen* states: *shi* is pronounced *sheng* below as well.\n\n\"Coming and going in succession, with no gap to omit—who perceives it?\"\n\n**[Annotation]** One who has just achieved completion already suffers loss; one who has just been born is already secretly dying.\n\nThe *Shiwen* states: *sheng* is read in the upper tone.\n\n\"Qi does not advance all at once\"—Bo Jun notes: *Jin* (进) originally means \"to ascend,\" as in the *Shuowen*. It also means \"to advance,\" as in the *Mao shi*’s \"Changwu\" *jiang*, the *Shi guan li* *zhu*, and the *Gongyang*’s commentary on the thirteenth year of Duke Zhuang. By extension, it takes the meaning of \"growth.\" Thus, in the *Zhou li*’s \"Xiao sikou,\" \"to regulate the state’s expenditures by advancing or retreating them,\" Zheng Xuan’s annotation explains: \"Advancing and retreating mean increasing and decreasing.\" Here, *jin* contrasts with *kui* (亏), and below, \"unaware of its completion\" follows \"does not advance all at once,\" while \"unaware of its loss\" follows \"does not diminish all at once.\" Thus, *jin* is akin to *cheng* (成).\n\nThe *Shiwen* states: *jin* is pronounced *jinyi*.\n\"A form does not diminish all at once; one is unaware of its completion, unaware of its loss.\"\n\n**[Annotation]** All occurs in obscurity, transforming imperceptibly—how could ears and eyes perceive it?\n\nLu Wenchang notes: In the *Zang* edition, the annotation includes the character *zhi* (之) after \"ears and eyes.\"\n\nBo Jun notes: The original text lacks the character *yi* (亦) before \"unaware of its loss\"; it has been added here following the *Sijie* edition and the Qin engraving.\n\nThe *Shiwen* states: *zhan* is written as *zhu*, pronounced *zhu*; one version writes it as *zhan*.\n\n\"It is like a person from birth\"—the *Shiwen* states: *shi* is pronounced *sheng*.\n\n\"To old age: appearance, complexion, wisdom, and demeanor change daily; skin, nails, and hair fall away with the world, not remaining as they were in infancy.\"\n\n**[Annotation]** Form, color, hair, and skin are the coarser aspects of existence. Even these, renewed and replaced, escape recognition—how much more so the subtler aspects?\n\nBo Jun notes: In the annotation, *zhi cu* (之粗) should not be written as *jing* (精). Lu Baojing’s punctuation, treating \"form, color, hair, and skin\" as a complete phrase, is also incorrect.\n\n\"With no perceptible interval, one only knows afterward.\"\n\n**[Exegesis]** The mind’s subtle operations, the stirring of yin and yang—thus the body transforms, heaven and earth shift imperceptibly, and loss, gain, fullness, and emptiness proceed. Who can awaken to this? Therefore, those who value the Dao know the root and do not grieve over loss.\n\nIn the state of Qi, there was a man who fretted that heaven and earth would collapse, leaving him nowhere to dwell, and thus neglected sleep and food. The *Chuxue ji* writes \"there was a man\" as \"once there was a man.\"\n\nThe *Shiwen* states: *zhui* is written as *sui*.\nThe *Xiben* states: Tang of Yin enfeoffed the Xia descendants in Qi; the Zhou later enfeoffed them there as well. Today, it is Yongqiu County in Chenliu. During the Wude era, it was once established as Qi Prefecture.\n\nRen Dachun notes: The *Chuci*’s \"Jiu ge\" writes *shijiao zhui xi* (矢交坠兮) with *zhui* as *sui*. In the *Xunzi*’s \"Ru xiao\" chapter, \"until their heads meet and the mountains *sui*,\" Yang Liang’s annotation reads: \"*Sui* is read as *zhui*.\" The *Huainanzi*’s \"Shuolin xun\" states, \"Things suspended and hanging may *sui* at times,\" with the annotation: \"*Sui* means *zhui*.\" In the *Han shu*’s \"Wang Mang zhuan,\" \"not *sui* like a hair,\" and in the \"Xu zhuan,\" \"their lineage will not *sui*,\" *bu sui* means *bu zhui*. The *Lishi*’s \"Xixia song\" and the \"Heng hai jiangjun Lü jun bei\" write *yun sui* as *yun zhui*. The \"Fan An bei\" writes *shi sui* as *shi zhui*. The *Jingshun shiwen* still preserves the ancient character.\n\nBo Jun notes: Wude was the reign title of Emperor Gaozu of Tang. Huang Yaopu suspected the *Shiwen* was a Song forgery (see the postscript to the Northern Song edition of the *Liezi*), but this passage disproves that. Moreover, the state of Qi, enfeoffed at the beginning of the Zhou, corresponds to present-day Qi County in the Kaifeng region of Henan. The *Shiji* includes its *shijia*.\n\nThere was another who, troubled by the first man’s worries, went to enlighten him.\n\n**[Annotation]** The first man’s worries were misguided, yet the second, though not misguided himself, worried over the first man’s misguided concerns rather than the actual cause of his distress. This analogy illustrates how accumulated delusions deepen—how could one enlighten the other?",
      "overlap_context": "prets *wu* as \"to play with,\" which is correct. It means that after affairs are broken and ruined, one applies benevolence and righteousness to patch them up, yet what is ruined cannot be made whole again. The *Daodejing*’s first chapter states, \"When the great Dao declines, there is benevolence and righteousness.\" The *Zhuangzi*’s \"Horse’s Hooves\" states, \"The sage hobbles for benevolence, limps for righteousness, and the world begins to doubt\"—this is the same idea. The note does not grasp it.",

The subsequent passage, \"When Master Liezi heard this, he laughed,\" also lacks *zhi*, confirming this.\n\n**[Annotation]** The *Shiwen* cites *Changluzi* as *Changluzǐ*, noting: The *Records of the Grand Historian* mentions a Changluzi from Chu. The *Hanshu* states that Changluzi authored nine chapters, classified under the Daoist school.\n\nRen Dachun notes: The *Xunzi*’s \"Fuguo\" chapter reads \"君卢屋妾,\" with Yang Liang’s annotation glossing *lúwū* as *lúwū* (hut). The *Zhuangzi*’s \"Rangwang\" chapter mentions \"□水,\" with the *Shiwen* reading *lǘ* (闾), while Sima Biao’s edition has *Lu* (卢) water. The *Huainanzi*’s \"Shuolin Xun\" states, \"The potter uses a cracked basin; the carpenter dwells in a narrow *lú* (庐),\" where *lú* is *lú* (hut). The *Guoyu*’s \"Jinyu\" reads, \"侏儒扶卢,\" with Wei Zhao’s annotation: \"*Lu* is the shaft of a spear or halberd.\" The *Kaogong Ji* states, \"Qin lacks *lú*,\" with the annotation: \"The handle of a spear or halberd, a bundled bamboo shaft.\" Thus, *lu* and *lú* are interchangeable. The *Wu Yue Chunqiu* reads \"吴子柯卢,\" while the *Shiji* writes *lú* (庐) instead of *lu* (卢). The *Zuozhuan* (Duke Huan, Year 13) *Shiwen* reads *lúróng* (庐戎) as written, with some editions using *lu* (卢), pronounced identically. The *Zuozhuan* (Duke Cheng, Year 13) *Shiwen* reads *Bólú* (伯庐), pronounced *lìwú*, with some editions using *lu* (卢). Thus, *lu* and *lú* are interchangeable, corroborating the *Shiwen*’s *lú* (卢). Furthermore, the *Shiji*’s \"Shen Dao\" chapter mentions \"Chu had Shizi Changlu,\" with the *Suoyin* noting, \"Changlu is unclear,\" evidently unaware of this passage in the *Liezi*.\n\nHe said: \"Rainbows and mirages, clouds and mist, wind and rain, the four seasons—these are the formations of accumulated *qi* that constitute heaven.

Thus, when things come to be, none know their dissolution; and when they dissolve, how can one know their coming to be? This is the manifest proof of going and coming, the clear evidence of success and failure. Yet I am equally present in both, with no distinction of feeling between them—where could the heart find room to dwell?\n\n**[Exegesis]** Now, heaven and earth are the greatest of things, while bodily forms are the smallest. Yet the great are but one thing, and the small are but one thing. All things must decay—why debate the matter? Moreover, in life one does not know death, and in death one does not know life; coming and going are not self-aware, and success and failure cannot be fathomed. If one examines oneself closely, one cannot even know these things—why then expend the heart’s effort on heaven and earth, or grieve and debate over matters beyond the realm of things?\n\n**[Phonetic Gloss]** *See* (見) is pronounced *xiàn*. *Chu* (处) is pronounced *chǔ*.\n\nShun asked Zheng, saying—**[Annotation]** Pi Xirui notes: *Zheng* (烝) should be *Cheng* (丞). **[Collation]** Bo Jun observes: Pi’s emendation is correct. The *Zhuangzi* \"Knowledge Wanders North\" chapter writes it as *Cheng* (丞), and the *Taiping Imperial Encyclopedia* (519) also cites it as *Cheng*. The *Phonetic Gloss* writes *Zheng* (烝) as *Cheng* (丞), noting: \"Cheng refers to an assistant or minister; one variant writes it as *Zheng*.\" Ren Dachun comments: The *Han Shu* \"Table of the Kings’ Sons and Lords\" records \"Chengyang Lord Jing,\" with Yan Shigu noting: \"*Cheng* is pronounced *zhēng*; the character may also be written as *Cheng* (丞).\" In the *Biography of Zhai Fangjin*, \"the Grand Protector’s assistant Chengyang Lord Zhen Han,\" Yan Shigu notes: \"*Cheng* is pronounced *zhēng*.\" The *Hou Han Shu* \"Treatise on Commanderies and States\" writes it as *Zhengyang* Lord. Since *Cheng* (承) and *Cheng* (丞) both have the pronunciation *zhēng*, they are interchangeable as *Zheng* (烝). Jing Shun’s *Phonetic Gloss* preserves the ancient reading by writing *Cheng* (丞) as *Zheng* (烝).\n\n\"Can the Dao be possessed and held?\"\n\n**[Annotation]** Shun wished to clarify that all beings are ultimately the same as non-being, so he took the Dao as the starting point of his question.\n\nLu Wenchang notes: At the end of the annotation, the Zang edition includes the character *ye* (也).\n\nThe reply came: \"Your body is not your own—how could you possess the Dao?\"\n\n**[Annotation]** Guo Xiang says: The body is not something you can possess; it simply exists of itself, a mere clod. If you do not even possess what you have, how much less can you possess what you do not have?\n\n**[Exegesis]** \"You\" and \"I\" are merely designations for self and other in bodily form, not references to the spirit. Common usage takes one’s own body as \"I\" and others as \"you.\" How then can one seek to possess the Dao? Thus it is said: \"Your body is not your own—how could you possess the Dao?\"\n\nShun said: \"If my body is not my own, then who possesses it?\"\n\n**[Annotation]** Since one possesses this body, the question is posed again.\n\n**[Phonetic Gloss]** *Chong* (重) is pronounced *zhòng*; the same below.\n\nThe reply came: \"It is the form bestowed by heaven and earth.\"\n\n**[Annotation]** It is a partial accumulation of the single qi.\n\nYu Yue notes: The *Strategies of the Warring States* (\"Qi Strategies\") states: \"I wish to entrust it to Zihigh,\" with the commentary: \"*Wei* (委) means to entrust.\" The *Zuozhuan* (Duke Cheng, second year) records: \"The king sent it to be entrusted to the three officials.\" Du Yu’s commentary: \"*Wei* (委) means to assign.\" Thus, \"the form bestowed by heaven and earth\" means the form assigned by heaven and earth. The three subsequent instances of *wei* (委) follow the same sense.\n\n\"Life is not your own—it is the harmony bestowed by heaven and earth.\"\n\n**[Annotation]** The accumulation of harmony gives rise to life.\n\n\"Your nature and destiny are not your own—they are the compliance bestowed by heaven and earth.\"\n\n**[Annotation]** The accumulation of compliance results in preservation and perishing.\n\nGuo Xiang says: If the body were yours to possess, then beauty and ugliness, life and death would be determined by you. Yet when qi gathers to form life, you cannot prevent it; when qi scatters in death, you cannot halt it. This shows that it forms and completes itself through its own bestowal—it is not yours to possess.\n\n\"Your children and grandchildren are not your own—they are the moltings bestowed by heaven and earth.\"\n\n**[Annotation]** Qi naturally accumulates and sheds like a cicada’s molting. If they were yours to possess, then the number of sons and daughters would also be determined by you.\n\n**[Collation]** The *Liu Tie* (10) and *Taiping Imperial Encyclopedia* (519) cite \"children and grandchildren\" as \"descendants.\" It is likely that this should be followed. Zhang’s commentary on the passage below reads: \"Where are descendants bestowed and molted?\" suggesting that his edition also read \"descendants.\"\n\n**[Phonetic Gloss]** *Tui* (蜕) is pronounced *shuì*.\n\nThus, in walking one does not know where one is going; in dwelling one does not know what one is holding; in eating one does not know the reason for it.\n\n**[Annotation]** All arise spontaneously from within, not through conscious knowledge.\n\nYu Yue notes: The *Zhuangzi* \"Knowledge Wanders North\" chapter writes: \"In eating, one does not know the taste.\"\n\nWang Shumin says: The *Exegesis of the Sage’s Meaning* by Emperor Huizong of Song and Fan Zhixu’s *Exegesis* both read \"does not know the taste\" for \"does not know the reason,\" matching the *Zhuangzi*.\n\n\"The forceful yang of heaven and earth is qi—how then could it be possessed?\"",

      "translated_text": "The empty space here [indicates a lacuna in the text].\n\n**[Annotation]** Heaven and earth are the greatest of the interwoven knots of return. Now, in walking, dwelling, eating, and resting, all are movements of the forceful yang qi—how could one recognize their underlying reason? \"Forceful yang\" means \"unyielding solidity.\" If it is not the ultimate principle of unyielding solidity, and one returns instead to the extreme of emptiness and harmony, then there is no form, no life, no death, no end—so where could one’s nature and life be entrusted and follow? Where could descendants be entrusted and molted? Where could walking and dwelling find rest? On what could eating and drinking depend?\n\n**[Exegesis]** Since one does not know that the numinous and luminous are the Dao, one borrows heaven and earth to explain it. Heaven governs numinous function; earth governs formed things. Those who engage with existence entrust their forms; those who embody harmony give rise to their natures; those who respond in function follow and comply; those who nurture emotions and rear offspring entrust and molt. Now, in your walking, stopping, eating, and resting, you know only the movements of forceful yang, yet do not know the true master of the numinous and luminous. How then could you possess the Dao?\n\nSomeone asked: \"Yu Shun was a sage—how could he not know the Dao?\"\nThe answer: \"When one borrows guest and host to debate confusion, how could one remain in profound silence alone? Yet *Zhuangzi* says: 'Puliang Yi had the talent of a sage but not the Dao of a sage; I have the Dao of a sage but not the talent of a sage.' Thus, those who possess talent to aid the world and occupy the throne of the ruler do not necessarily know the Dao. Those who dwell beneath mountain forests with a reputation for solitary integrity do not necessarily govern others. Therefore, the Yellow Emperor, after thirty years on the throne, only then dreamed of the Land of Huaxu. Yao, after meeting the Four Masters, only then gazed in wonder at the northern bank of the Fen River. That Shun had not yet awakened—what is strange about that?\"\n\n**[Note]** In the line \"If it is not unyielding solidity,\" four editions read \"and is not unyielding solidity.\"\n\nWang Chongmin says: In the *Zhuangzi* \"Knowledge Wanders North\" chapter, there is a \"之\" after \"heaven and earth,\" which cannot be omitted here. It is likely that the *Liezi* originally included this \"之,\" but it is now missing from the current edition.\n\nGuo Xiang’s commentary states: \"Forceful yang is merely movement.\" Furthermore, in the \"Parables\" chapter, it says: \"If they come, I come with them; if they go, I go with them; if they are forceful yang, I am forceful yang with them.\" Guo Xiang’s commentary explains: \"Simply following the spontaneous movements of forceful yang in coming and going.\" Thus, \"forceful yang\" carries the meaning of movement, likely sharing the same iterative rhyme as *changyang* and *xiangyang*. This means that the life, nature, and descendants of the self are not possessed by the person but are all interwoven knots of heaven and earth. Moreover, one does not know that the rotation and movement of heaven and earth are also the work of a single qi. If one understands that the rotation of heaven and earth is the movement of qi, then how could anything between heaven and earth be possessed? The phrase \"the forceful yang of heaven and earth\" should be punctuated after \"heaven and earth.\" Without the \"之,\" the meaning would be unclear.\n\nZhang’s commentary says: \"Forceful yang means unyielding solidity,\" which is incorrect.\n\n**[Phonetic Gloss]** *Fu* (復) is pronounced *fú*.\n\nThe Guo family of Qi was immensely wealthy, while the Xiang family of Song was extremely poor.\n\n**[Phonetic Gloss]** *Xiang* (向) is pronounced *xiàng*.\n\nThe Xiang family traveled from Song to Qi to ask for their method. The Guo family told them: \"I am skilled in theft. When I first began stealing, after one year I had enough; after two years, I was sufficient; after three years, I greatly prospered.\"\n\n**[Note]** *Rang* (穰) was originally written as *rang* (壤).\n\nHong Yi says: In the *Zhuangzi* \"Gengsang Chu\" chapter, it says: \"After three years, the people of Weilei greatly prospered.\" The phonetic gloss notes: \"Cui’s edition writes *rang* (穰).\" In ancient times, the character *rang* (穰) was always written as *rang* (壤).\n\nWang Chongmin says: The *Shuowen* defines *rang* (穰) as \"millet that has sprouted and grown.\" Under the character *yang* (秧), it says: \"Rice seedlings are like *yangrang* (秧穰).\" *Yangrang* are iterative rhyme characters, like *rangrang* (穰穰). Thus, *rang* has two meanings, and *yangrang* is the origin of the meaning of \"great prosperity\" here. Furthermore, according to the *Shuowen*, *rang* (壤) means \"soft earth.\" Since *rang* (壤) is the ancient character, there is no evidence for it in antiquity, and it is likely that later people confused the two. The meaning of *rang* (穰) is closer to the intended sense. Xu Shen also used it to explain characters, so *rang* (穰) is the older form. The Cui edition of *Zhuangzi* and the alternate edition seen by Lu Deming both write *rang* (穰), as does the *Liezi* Jifu edition and the *Taiping Yulan* (485), which also write *rang* (穰).\n\nYang Bojun’s note: Wang’s argument is sound; here, we follow the Jifu edition in writing *rang* (穰).\n\n**[Phonetic Gloss]** *Rang* (穰) is written as *rang* (壤), glossed as *rǎng*, and also written as *rang* (穰).\n\n\"From then on, [my prosperity] extended to the towns and villages.\"\n\n**[Note]** *Shi* (施) means \"to bestow\" (as in the *Guoyu* commentary to \"Duke Qi loved to display his efforts and bestow favors\").\n\n**[Phonetic Gloss]** *Shi* (施) is pronounced *yì*, meaning \"to extend.\"\n\nThe Xiang family was overjoyed. They understood the words about theft but did not grasp the Dao of theft.\n\n**[Note]** In the *Liu Tie* (91), the first \"understood\" (*yu*, 喻) is written as \"heard\" (*wen*, 聞), and \"Dao\" (道) is written as \"meaning\" (*yi*, 意).\n\nThey then climbed walls and tunneled through houses, taking everything their hands and eyes reached.\n\n**[Note]** In the *Liu Tie* (91), \"tunneled through houses\" (*zao shi*, 凿室) is written as \"pierced the eaves\" (*chuan yu*, 穿宇), and \"taking\" (*tan ye*, 探也) is written as \"taking away\" (*tan qu*, 探取).\n\n**[Phonetic Gloss]** *Wang* (亡) is pronounced *wú*; the same below.\n\nBefore long, they were caught with stolen goods and punished.\n\n**[Phonetic Gloss]** *Zang* (赃) is pronounced *zāng*.\n\nThey lost all the wealth they had previously accumulated.\n\nYu Yue says: \"Accumulated\" (*ju*, 居) means \"stored,\" referring to the wealth they had previously stored. In the *Analects*, \"Zang Wenzhong accumulated a *cai*\" (*Lunyu* \"Gongye Chang\"), and Huang Kan’s commentary says: \"*Ju* means 'to store.'\" This is the same meaning.\n\nWu Kaisheng says: *Ju* (居) should be read as *zhu* (贮).\n\nWang Chongmin says: The *Taiping Yulan* (485) writes \"former lord\" (*xian jun*, 先君), which is better in meaning.\n\nYang Bojun’s note: In the \"King Mu of Zhou\" chapter, it says: \"Offering half of his accumulated wealth to request their methods.\" Here, *ju* also means \"to accumulate.\" Yu’s and Wu’s interpretations are the same and can both be used. The *Taiping Yulan* does not grasp the meaning and arbitrarily changes it to \"lord\" (*jun*, 君), which cannot be trusted.",

At the beginning of nurturing, one abandons the myriad existences and inwardly settles the mind. When wisdom is brought forth, one transforms living beings and outwardly engages with things. Thus, in its initial stage, one purifies the mind and disciplines the body, not becoming entangled in political affairs. By the final chapter, one assists Confucius and Mozi in aiding others.

This is an example. The original text of the *Liezi* reads \"养生命\" (nourishing life and destiny), for *sheng* (life) is *xing* (nature), and thus it was mistakenly written as *zheng* (proper).

      "translated_text": "Having exhausted their keen hearing and sharp sight, exerted their wisdom and strength—*Shiwen* reads \"进智\" (*jin zhi*, advance governance) as \"进治\" (*jin zhi*, advance order), noting *jin* is pronounced *jin*—they toil for the common folk, their complexions parched and sallow, their five senses dulled and confused.\n\n**[Annotation]** The use of keen hearing and sharp sight is insufficient to bring order; it only serves to disorder the spirit.\n\n**[Exegesis]** The age calls them gentlemen—those who govern others. All wear themselves out in life, torment their own bodies, sacrifice themselves for external things, seeking fame and pursuing profit. Yet they do not realize they exhaust their spirits to lose their true selves, drifting ever farther from the Dao. *Exegesis* of \"劳生\" (*lao sheng*, toil in life): Four editions read \"劳心\" (*lao xin*, toil in mind).\n\nThen the Yellow Emperor sighed in admiration—**[Annotation]** *赞* (*zan*) should be *叹* (*tan*, sigh). *Shiwen* notes *赞* is pronounced *tan*—and said, \"My errors run deep—**[Annotation]** *淫* (*yin*) should be *深* (*shen*, deep). *Shiwen* notes *淫* is pronounced *shen*—in nurturing my own self, the harm is thus; in governing the myriad things, the harm is thus.\"\n\n**[Annotation]** Only by acting without nurturing, indulging without governing, can one’s nature and life remain whole, and the world at peace.\n\n**[Exegesis]** *淫* (*yin*) means to lose the Way. All living things know to nurture themselves, selfishly preserving their lives, yet do not know that what gives life also leads to death. Those who grasp at benevolence and righteousness all know to sacrifice for fame and profit, selfishly displaying their abilities, yet do not know that this exhausts the spirit and harms life, leading to death. To sacrifice oneself for selfish ends is the way of the petty man; to aid others without selfishness is the way the age calls a gentleman. To turn good into evil, when measured externally, appears distinct; to seek fame at the cost of reality, when measured internally, is a loss for both. Thus, in clarifying the great Dao, both are equally rejected.\n\nWang Lai notes: In the *Exegesis*, after \"不知所生\" (*bu zhi suo sheng*, do not know that which gives life), the character \"以\" (*yi*, thereby) is missing. Also, \"伤生而知死也\" (*shang sheng er zhi si ye*, harms life and knows death) should read \"伤生而之死也\" (*shang sheng er zhi si ye*, harms life and thereby leads to death).\n\nThereupon, he relinquished the myriad affairs of state, abandoned his palace chambers—*宫* (*gong*): The Qin engraving and Lu’s *Exegesis* read *官* (*guan*, offices); the *Shide Tang* edition also reads *官*, which is incorrect. *Yulin* (79) and *Leiju* (11) correctly cite *宫*. *Shiwen* notes *舍* (*she*) is pronounced *she*—dismissed his attendants—*Shiwen* notes *去* (*qu*) is pronounced *qu*—removed the bells and suspended instruments—Wang Shumin notes: *彻* (*che*) is a loan for *撤* (*che*, remove). The *Shuowen* defines *撤* as \"to send forth,\" extended to mean \"to remove.\" *Shuchao* (12) and *Yulin* (79) both read *彻* as *撤*, with *撤* being the vulgar form of *撤*. *Shiwen* reads *悬* (*xuan*) as *县* (*xuan*), noting *县* is pronounced *xuan*—reduced the royal cuisine, and retired to dwell in seclusion in the Hall of the Great Court—*Shiwen* notes *间* (*jian*) is pronounced *xian*—where he purified his mind and disciplined his form—**[Annotation]** With the mind free of desire, the form naturally submits.\n\n*Shiwen* reads *斋* (*zhai*, purify) as *齐* (*qi*), noting *齐* is pronounced *zhai*, and the same below. For three months, he did not attend to governance.\n\n**[Exegesis]** To \"relinquish the myriad affairs\" does not mean to do nothing at all. Matters arise, and one responds like the four seasons. Thus it is said: \"What does Heaven say? The four seasons proceed, and the hundred things are born.\" Not to toil with anxious thoughts to chase empty fame, nor to scheme for ability across a thousand years, desiring to leave a fragrant name on bamboo and silk. Rather, one acts in obscurity, moved only by necessity. One does not exalt one’s own name, nor increase one’s desires, nor enrich one’s flavors, nor indulge in wanton sounds. The mind is purified and solemn; the body is withdrawn and subdued. \"Three months\" refers to a single season. Confucius said, \"For three months, Yan Hui did not stray from benevolence.\" This is the same. Selecting worthy talent and holding them accountable, rewarding and punishing without partiality—this is what it means not to attend to governance.",

      "translated_text": "In waking slumber one dreams—[this signifies that] the ultimate principle cannot be sought through emotion, and so it is entrusted to dreams. The sage has no dreams. One wanders in the land of Huaxu. The land of Huaxu lies west of Yan Prefecture and north of Tai Prefecture—[this does not mean such a land necessarily exists; it merely illustrates that the ultimate principle must be thus]. *Huainanzi* states: \"Due west is called Yan Prefecture; northwest is called Tai Prefecture.\" [Lu] Bojun notes: The commentary cites *Huainanzi* from the \"Treatise on Topography.\" *Shiwen* reads: *Yan* is pronounced *yan*. One knows not how many thousands or tens of thousands of *li* this land is distant—[the note explains:] *Si* means \"apart\"; *qi* means \"center.\" *Leiju* 11 and *Tianzhongji* 23 both quote \"apart\" as \"distance,\" likely a conjectural emendation. *Shiwen* reads: *Ji* is pronounced *ji*. It is beyond the reach of boats, carriages, or the strength of feet, attainable only through spirit-wandering—[the note explains:] Boats, carriages, and the strength of feet are but the means of form. The spirit-way is indistinct and elusive, arriving without traversing.\n\nIn that land, there are no masters or elders. The *Shide Tang* edition writes \"master\" as \"commander.\" Yu Yue says: *Shiwen* notes that \"commander\" may also be written as \"master,\" and the latter should be followed. The *Rites of Zhou*, in the \"Office of the Grand Steward,\" states: \"With nine bonds one unites the people of the state,\" the second being \"elders who gain the people through nobility,\" and the third, \"masters who gain the people through worthiness.\" This is the meaning of \"masters and elders.\" That the land has no masters or elders shows there is no distinction between noble and base, worthy and foolish. If written as \"commanders and elders,\" it would only mean no distinction between noble and base, leaving the meaning incomplete. The Lu Chongxuan edition correctly writes \"masters and elders.\" Wang Chongmin says: Yu Yue’s argument is sound. The Northern Song edition and *Taiping Yulan* (79 and 397) both write \"master.\" *Shiwen* writes \"commander\" as \"master,\" noting: *Commander* is pronounced *shuai*; some write it as *master*. *Elder* is pronounced *zhang*. \"Commanders and elders\" means \"leaders and chiefs.\"\n\nAll is spontaneous and nothing more. Its people have no desires—*Shiwen* reads: *Desire* is pronounced *shi*. All is spontaneous and nothing more—[the note explains:] \"Spontaneous\" means not relying on externals. They do not know to delight in life, nor to loathe death, and so there are no premature deaths. They do not know to cherish themselves—*Shiwen* reads: *Oneself* is pronounced *ji*—nor to estrange others, and so there is no love or hatred. They do not know to turn their backs—*Shiwen* reads: *Back* is pronounced *pei*—nor to face forward, and so there is no benefit or harm—[the note explains:] In principle, there is no life or death, and so there is nothing to delight in or loathe; in principle, there is no love or hatred, and so there is nothing to cherish or estrange; in principle, there is no turning away or facing forward, and so there is no benefit or harm. They hold nothing in love or regret—Wang Chongmin says: *Regret* should be *hatred*, a scribal error. The preceding text states, \"They do not know to cherish themselves, nor to estrange others, and so there is no love or hatred,\" which this directly follows. If written as *regret*, it would not convey the meaning. *Taiping Yulan* 79 correctly writes *hatred*. Wang Shumin says: Fan Zhixu’s commentary reads, \"They hold nothing in love or hatred, and so their minds know nothing,\" indicating that the edition he saw also wrote *regret* as *hatred*.

      "translated_text": "The axe’s blows bring no pain, the lashes no hurt—*Shiwen* notes: *Zhuo* is read as *zhuó*. *Tà* means \"to strike.\" The probing of fingers elicits no soreness or itch. [Commentary] One who has attained perfect harmony cannot be harmed by anything. Heat, drowning, pain, and itching arise only from self-importance and fear; the principles are explained in detail in the following chapter. *Xiao yang* refers to *suan xiao* (aching soreness); the meaning is found in the *Rites of Zhou*. Lu Wenchang says: In the commentary, the character *yang* in *xiao yang* is superfluous. The *xiao* in *suan xiao* should be written as *xuē* (to pare). Bo Jun notes: Zheng Xuan’s commentary to the *Rites of Zhou*, under \"Physician of Illnesses\" in the \"Offices of Heaven,\" states, \"*Xiao* means *suan xuē* (aching and paring),\" which is the basis for Lu’s interpretation. *Shiwen* notes: *Tī* is read as *tì*, meaning \"to scratch.\" *Xiao* is read as *xiāo*. *Yang* is read as *yǎng* (in the *yú liǎng* rhyme). *Xiao yang* means pain and itching. In the *Rites of Zhou*, spring brings the illness of *xiao* in the head, and summer brings the itching scabies. Zheng Xuan says: \"*Xiao* means *suan xuē* (aching and paring).\" The *Shuowen* states: \"*Suan* means aching pain.\" *Jiàn* is read as *xiàn biàn*. Ren Dachun says: The *Shuowen* contains the character *xiao*, read as *xiāo* (in the *xiāng yāo* rhyme), and defines it as *suan xiao* (aching pain in the head), with the phonetic *xiao*. However, it does not contain the character *suan*. Jing Shun’s *Shiwen* cites the *Shuowen* as writing *suan* and defining it as \"aching pain.\" This passage does not appear in the current *Shuowen*. Consulting the *Yupian*, *suan* is read as *xiān wán* and means \"aching pain.\" Jing Shun thus mistakenly cited the *Yupian* as the *Shuowen*.\n\nThey tread upon emptiness as if walking on solid ground, and lie in the void as if resting on a bed. Clouds and mist do not obstruct their vision—Hu Huaichen says: *Jù* means \"to hinder.\" Duan Yucai’s commentary to the *Shuowen* on the character *ài* (to obstruct) states that the *Liezi* writes it as *jù*, which is correct. Xu Weiyu says: *Jù* is interchangeable with *hé* (to block). *Shiwen* notes: *Jù* is read as *wǔ gài*. Thunder does not confuse their hearing—*Shiwen* notes: *Tíng* is read as *tíng*. Beauty and ugliness do not disturb their minds—Wang Shumin says: The *Taiping Yulan* (79) writes *gǔ* (to disturb) as *gǔ* (to sink). Fan Zhixu’s commentary reads, \"With the heart hollowed out, nothing can sink it,\" indicating that the edition he saw also wrote it as *gǔ*. *Gǔ* and *gǔ* were interchangeable in antiquity. The *Zhuangzi* (\"Equalizing Things\") states, \"Set aside its *gǔ hūn*,\" and the *Shiwen* cites Xiang Xiu as writing *gǔ* as *gǔ*. The *Xunzi* (\"Chengxiang\") states, \"Officials carefully guide them without *pī gǔ*,\" and the commentary notes, \"*Gǔ* is interchangeable with *gǔ*,\" which serves as a parallel. *Shiwen* notes: *Gǔ* is read as *gǔ*. Mountains do not trip their steps—*Shiwen* notes: *Zhì* is read as *zhì*. Their spirit moves as it wills. [Commentary] One who has attained perfect compliance cannot be opposed by anything.\n\n[Exegesis] This is metaphorical language. By purifying the mind and disciplining the body, the spirit unites with the Dao, and one attains the great state. The spirit is the master of life. As the master of life, if one employs the spirit to nurture life but does so improperly, it instead becomes harmful. The common folk regard indulging desires as nurturing life, but this is precisely the root of shortening one’s years. Thus, the noble person nurtures their nature, while the petty person nurtures their emotions. To nurture one’s nature is to have no desires, to preserve naturalness, to take no joy in life, to feel no aversion to death, to have no inclinations or aversions, no loves or hatreds, no fears or dreads—all is natural. When the spirit moves, it is the spirit uniting with the Dao. This does not refer to a separate state or a different kind of person. Thus it is said: The Dao of benevolence is not distant; to practice it is to attain it. Those who meet in a single word grasp it as if clasping arms in mutual understanding.\n\nAfter awakening, the Yellow Emperor—[Commentary] This too is metaphorical, referring to waking and sleeping; the sage has no distinction between waking and sleeping—felt joyful and at ease. *Yí* in the *Shide Tang* edition is written as *wù*. Wang Chongmin says: The version with *yí* is closer to correct. The Northern Song edition, the Jifu edition, and the *Taiping Yulan* (397) all write it as *yí*. Bo Jun notes: The Qin-dynasty Lu commentary edition also writes it as *yí*. The version with *wù* is a scribal error. *Shiwen* notes: *Yí* is read as *yǔ zhī*. He summoned Tian Lao, Li Mu, and Tai Shan Ji—[Commentary] These three were the Yellow Emperor’s ministers. Lu Wenchang says: In the *Zang* edition, *Tai* is written as *Da*. The *Shiwen* writes *Tai* as *Da*, noting: *Da* is read as *tài*. *Ji* is read as *jī*. The *Hanshu* states: Da Shan Ji was the Yellow Emperor’s teacher. *Xiàng* is read as *xī liàng*. Ren Dachun says: The *Lushi Qianji* records that Da Tian was the Yellow Emperor’s teacher and Da Shan Ji was his Minister of Education. The Tang Bohai clan was surnamed Da. The pronunciation of Da Shan Ji as *Tài* is incorrect. Consulting the *Guangyun* (14, *Tai* rhyme), under the character *da*, the compound surnames listed include Da Hu Shi, Huang Yi Dafu Da Xin Zicheng, Qin General Da Luo Hong, Da Luo Shi, Da Ye Shi, and Da Shu Shi. If the *Lushi* is correct, then the *Guangyun*’s omission of Da Shan Ji before the compound surnames is an oversight. The *Xingshi Jijiu Pian* lists the Da clan, including Tang Bohai’s Da Zuorong and Da Menyi, and the Song’s Da Zhouren, which corroborates the *Lushi*’s claim that the Bohai clan was surnamed Da but does not mention Da Shan Ji.\n\nHe addressed them, saying: \"During my three months of leisurely retreat, I purified my mind and disciplined my body, seeking a way to nurture the self and govern things, but I have not obtained the method.\" [Commentary] The self cannot be nurtured, things cannot be governed, and yet one exhausts their spirit seeking it in vain.",
      "overlap_context": "hey do not know to cherish themselves, nor to estrange others, and so there is no love or hatred,\" which this directly follows.

      "translated_text": "The *Shanhaijing* mentions Mount Guye in two instances. The *Eastern Mountains Classic* states: \"From Mount Luqi, traveling three hundred and eighty *li* south is Mount Guye, where no grasses or trees grow, but water abounds. Traveling another three hundred *li* south by water and a hundred *li* through flowing sands, one reaches North Mount Guye, where no grasses or trees grow, but stones are plentiful. Traveling another three hundred *li* south is South Mount Guye, where no grasses or trees grow, but water abounds.\" The *Classic of Regions Within the Seas: Northern Lands* states: \"West Mount Guye lies amid the isles of the sea and rivers.\" Guo Pu annotates: \"It is a mountain name. The mountain is inhabited by divine beings. The river isles lie within the sea, where the Yellow River flows—this is the Mount Guye of which Zhuangzi speaks as 'distant Mount Guye.'\" The *Classic* further states: \"The state of Guye lies in the sea, belonging to the array of Guye Mountains, encircled by mountains to the southwest.\"\n\nExamining the *Eastern Mountains Classic*, Mount Guye is located in Linfen County, as recorded in the *Geographical Treatises of the Sui Dynasty*—this is the present-day Nine-Aperture Mountain west of Pingyang Prefecture. There are no so-called North or South Mount Guye in its vicinity; thus, the two entries for North and South Mount Guye in the *Eastern Mountains Classic* should belong under the \"encircled by mountains to the southwest\" passage in the *Classic of Regions Within the Seas: Northern Lands*. Jing Shun’s cited *Shanhaijing* is a Tang-era edition, and his statement that \"the rows of Guye Mountains lie between the sea and the rivers\" particularly clarifies the meaning of the character *lie* (array). He further notes: \"This chapter aligns with the *Shanhaijing*; thus, the *Liezi*’s descriptions of 'breathing wind and drinking dew' and the like are also found in the *Shanhaijing*. The omissions and misplaced bamboo slips in the current edition are thereby evident.\"\n\nLater scholars, misled by Zhuangzi’s phrase \"distant Mount Guye north of the Fen River,\" assumed it referred to the Guye in Linfen. Bi Yuan, in his collated and published *Shanhaijing*, asserts under the \"array of Guye\" entry in the *Classic of Regions Within the Seas: Northern Lands* that Guye is in Shanxi and that Guo’s annotation erroneously cites Zhuangzi. Yet he fails to recognize that Zhuangzi’s \"distant Mount Guye, where divine beings dwell,\" aligns with the *Liezi*’s account—both undoubtedly refer to the array of Guye in the sea. As for Yao’s encounter with the Four Masters \"north of the Fen River on distant Mount Guye,\" this pertains to the Guye Mountain in Linfen, not the array of Guye Mountains. The contexts are entirely distinct; to hastily dismiss Jing Chun’s annotation as erroneous betrays a lack of thorough investigation. In the *Zhuangzi*, *lie* (array) is written as *miao* (distant). Lu’s *Pronunciations and Meanings* cites Jian Wen’s gloss: \"Miao means distant.\" The conflation of these two mountain names has persisted for ages, risking confusion for later learners—hence this detailed clarification.\n\nOn the mountain dwell divine beings—[Annotation] Serene and still, they are thus called divine beings. Lu’s *Pronunciations and Meanings* states: \"This chapter aligns with the *Shanhaijing*.\" They breathe wind and drink dew—[Pronunciation] *Xi* is pronounced *xie*. They do not eat the five grains—[Annotation] Having forsaken the five grains, why would they still need to breathe wind and drink dew? This describes the appearance of exhaling and inhaling, no different from other beings. Lu’s *Pronunciations and Meanings* states: *Fu* is pronounced *fuyou*. Their minds are like deep springs—[Pronunciation] The character *yuan* is read as *shen* (deep). Their forms are like maidens—[Annotation] Those who embody the utmost softness and emptiness possess a natural purity of countenance, unwaning without cultivation. Lu’s *Pronunciations and Meanings* states: *Cui* is pronounced *sui*. They are neither partial nor attached—[Annotation] *Wei* also means attachment. Like straw dogs to the myriad things, their kindness is impartial. *Wei* is pronounced *yinwei*. Lu’s *Pronunciations and Meanings* states: *Wei* is pronounced *wuhui*, meaning attachment. \"Neither partial nor attached\" suggests concealment or revelation. The *Shanhaijing* states: \"In the corner of the Northern Sea, its people dwell in water, partial and attached\"—this refers to concealment. The *Zilin* states: *Wei* means vaguely seen, indistinct. Bo Jun notes: The *Shuowen* defines *ai* as \"vague, indistinct,\" citing the *Book of Songs*: \"Vague and unseen.\" In the current *Book of Songs*, *ai* is written as *ai*. Here, *ai* is also borrowed for *ai*, hence Lu’s gloss as \"concealment.\" The *Shanhaijing*’s *Classic of Regions Within the Seas* states \"neither fearing nor attached,\" with Guo’s annotation: \"Fear also means attachment,\" following this precedent.

With unobstructedness, nothing is too distant to perceive; without suffering, one rides the wind in motion.

      "translated_text": "Liezi said, \"Why do you come and go so frequently?\" The *Shiwen* notes: *rǔ* (汝) is written as *nǚ* (女), pronounced *rǔ*. Yin Sheng replied, \"Formerly, Zhang Dai made requests of you.\" The annotation states: *Zhang Dai* is Yin Sheng’s name. Lu Wenchang notes: The annotation under Yin Sheng’s name in the Zang edition includes the character *zhī* (之). The *Shiwen* notes: *dài* (戴) is written as *zài* (载), and *nǎng* (曩) is pronounced *nǎng*. *Zhang Zai*’s courtesy name is *Zai Ze*; one edition writes *Zhang Dai*. \"You did not instruct me, so I naturally harbored resentment toward you. Now, my mind is suddenly at ease, which is why I have returned.\" Liezi said, \"Formerly, I took you for one who had attained understanding.\" The annotation states: *nǎng* means \"formerly.\" Wang Shumin notes: This annotation likely belongs below the earlier phrase *\"nǎng zhāng dài yǒu qǐng yú zǐ\"* (曩章戴有请于子). \"But has your vulgarity truly reached this point? Ji! I shall now tell you what I learned from the Master.\" The annotation states: *jī* (姬) means \"to reside.\" The *Shiwen* notes: *jī* is pronounced *jū*. The explanation states: When you left before, I thought you had grasped my Way. Now that you return to dispel your resentment, I know your shallowness. The explanation notes: The original text read *\"duì hàn\"* (怼憾), but this has been corrected to *\"xī hàn\"* (息憾) according to the *Sijie* edition. The *Shiwen* notes: *rǔ* (汝) is written as *nǚ* (女), pronounced *rǔ*.\n\n\"Since I began studying under the Master and befriended such a person—after three years, my mind dared not entertain thoughts of right and wrong, nor my mouth speak of profit and harm—I only then received a single glance from the Master.\" The annotation states: Though inwardly harboring thoughts of profit and harm, one dared not speak of them, concealing resentment and hiding true feelings. Thus, he merely glanced at me. The explanation states: One who is single-minded and unwavering, reverent and devoted, seeking to observe my form and emulate my conduct, receives only a sidelong glance. The *Shiwen* notes: *miǎn* (眄) is pronounced *miàn*. \"After five years, my mind *gēng* contemplated right and wrong, and my mouth *gēng* spoke of profit and harm.\" The annotation states: *Gēng* should be *gèng*. The *Jifu* edition writes *gèng* (更). The *Shiwen* notes: *gēng* is pronounced *gèng*, *jū xíng qiè*, meaning \"to increase\"; the same applies below. \"Only then did the Master smile once, relaxing his countenance.\" The annotation states: Right and wrong, profit and harm are the common principles of the world. Following the mind’s thoughts and the mouth’s words without restraint or hesitation in the heart, aligning inner and outer as one—is this not surpassing concealment and revealing all? Delighted by this unity, he playfully bestowed a smile. The explanation states: After three years, one was devoted to stillness, receiving only glances. After five years, surpassing devotion, his smile became evident. The Northern Song edition writes *mín* (忞) for *lìn* (吝), *chàng* (鬯) for *xiōng* (胸), and *xún* (循) for *yóu* (犹), all of which are incorrect and have been corrected here. The *Shide Tang* edition writes *jǐ* (己) for *nì* (匿), which is also incorrect. The *Shiwen* notes: *nì* is written as *jǐ* in one edition.\n\n\"After seven years, following the mind’s thoughts, *gēng* there was no right or wrong; following the mouth’s words, *gēng* there was no profit or harm. Only then did the Master draw me to sit beside him on the same mat.\" The annotation states: What is the mind? It is stillness without thought. What is the mouth? It is silence, naturally inhaling and exhaling. If one follows the mind’s utmost, there is no right or wrong; if one follows the mouth’s principle, there is no profit or harm. When the Dao harmonizes with teacher and friend, sharing the same position side by side, it is fitting. The explanation states: One speaks only after careful consideration, ensuring no error in right or wrong, profit or harm. The *Shiwen* notes: *qì* (契) is pronounced *kǔ jì qiè*. \"After nine years, freely following the mind’s thoughts, freely speaking the mouth’s words, I no longer knew whether my own right and wrong, profit and harm existed, nor whether the Master was my teacher or such a person my friend. Inner and outer had reached perfection.\" The annotation states: With the mind devoid of thought and the mouth free of contradiction, one can indulge the mind’s thoughts and give free rein to the mouth’s words. Having mastered the Dao and exhausted its essence, one becomes a bridge for the world. Though thoughts arise all day, they are not my thoughts; though words are spoken all day, they are not my words. If one takes non-thought as thought and non-speech as speech, one has not yet reached the ultimate. The so-called \"non-action that leaves nothing undone\" is like this. Then where can one seek the difference between self and other? Where can the relationship between teacher and student be applied? Thus, it is said that inner and outer are complete. The explanation states: With the mind utterly empty, right and wrong, profit and harm are spoken without distinction—this is freedom. Following the mind’s freedom in speech, all aligns with the Dao. The *Shiwen* notes: *zào* (造) is pronounced *qī dào qiè*.\n\n\"Afterward, eyes were like ears, ears like noses, noses like mouths—none were different.\" The explanation states: Eyes, ears, mouth, and nose did not use their respective functions but acted without intention, thus none were different. \"The mind congealed, the form dissolved, bones and flesh fused entirely. Unaware of where the body leaned,\" the *Shiwen* notes: *yǐ* (倚) is pronounced *yú qǐ qiè*, \"or where the feet trod, I drifted east and west with the wind like a withered leaf or a dried husk.\" Shen Tao notes: Dai Tong’s *Liu Shu Gu* cites the Tang edition of the *Shuowen*, saying *gān* (干) is the original character for dryness, interchangeable with *gān* (乾). The Xu edition omits *gān*. Tao’s note: *Gān* is the proper character for dryness, interchangeable with *gān*. The *Liezi Huangdi* chapter’s \"withered leaf or dried husk,\" with Zhang Zhan’s annotation (note: should be *Shiwen*), *gān* pronounced *gān*, serves as evidence. The *Shiwen* notes: *gān* is pronounced *gān*, and *ké* (壳) is pronounced *kǒu jiǎo qiè*. \"Did the wind ride me, or did I ride the wind?\" The annotation states: Eyes, ears, nose, and mouth each have their respective functions.",

Yin Sheng, resentful, asked to take his leave. The *Shiwen* notes: *duì* (怼) is pronounced *zhuì*, meaning resentment. Liezi, however, gave no command. The *Shiwen* reads: \"又不與命,\" noting that one edition omits the character *yǔ* (與). Yin Sheng withdrew. Months later, his resolve unabated, he returned to follow Liezi once more.",

      "translated_text": "Laozi said: *\"My great affliction arises from having a body; if I were without a body, what affliction could I have?\"* If one cannot forget the form and bones, then even the weight of a single joint would be more than the earth could bear—how then could one find leisure to ride the wind and tread the void?\n\n**[Annotation]** The *Exegesis* cites Laozi’s *\"what affliction could I have?\"*—the present text omits the character *\"也\"*. *Shiwen* notes: *\"复\"* is pronounced *fù*. Liezi asked Guan Yin: *Shiwen* notes: Guan Yin was Guan Ling Yin Xi, styled Gongdu, who wrote nine chapters. **[Annotation]** The present *Guan Yinzi* consists of one scroll and nine chapters; Chen Zhensun of the Southern Song, in his *Zhizhai shulu jieti*, suspected it to be a forgery by Sun Ding (a Southern Song figure), while the *Siku quanshu* *tiyao* suggests it may have been composed by a Tang or Five Dynasties Daoist versed in literary arts.\n\n*\"The perfected person moves through water without obstruction—[Annotation] 'Without obstruction' means 'substantially present.' The perfected person’s movements and stillness are not hindered by substantial presence.\"* Guo Xiang said: *\"Their mind is empty, thus they can master all that is substantial.\"* The *Daozang* Jiang Yu edition and the Song Huizong edition both write *\"窒\"* instead of *\"空\"*—*\"窒\"* is correct. However, Zhang Zhan’s original text reads *\"空\"*, so it is retained here. Yu Yue said: Zhang’s annotation is overly convoluted. *Shiwen* states: *\"空, one version writes 窒\"*—this should be followed. The *Zhuangzi* *\"Da Sheng\"* chapter indeed reads *\"不窒\"*. **[Annotation]** Master Zhongfu said: Yu Yue’s view is correct. *\"潜行\"* refers to moving through water. The *Shuowen*, in the water section of its eleventh chapter, states: *\"泳 means to move submerged in water.\"* The *Zuozhuan* of the seventeenth year of Duke Ai records: *\"The Viscount of Yue led his three armies to cross the river in secret.\"* The *Hanfeizi* *\"Shi Guo\"* chapter recounts the siege of Zhao by Zhi Bo: *\"He breached the dikes of Jinyang to flood the city, besieging it for three years. Within the city, people nested in trees and cooked in suspended cauldrons. Zhang Mengtan said to Viscount Xiang of Zhao: 'I request to attempt a secret crossing to meet with the lords of Han and Wei.'\"*—all these serve as evidence. *\"窒\"* means suffocation; moving through water and entering fire are directly opposed. *Shiwen* notes: *\"潜\"* is sometimes written *\"渐\"*, also pronounced *qián*. *\"空\"* is written as *\"窒\"* in one version, meaning blockage. *\"阂\"* is pronounced *ài*. Qin Enfu said: In the *Yi*, *\"阒其无人\"*, Lu’s *Shiwen* notes: Meng’s version writes *\"窒\"*. Yu Fan’s commentary: *\"Empty.\"* *\"空\"* as *\"窒\"* is like *\"乱\"* glossed as *\"治\"*.\n\n*\"They tread fire without being burned, walk atop the myriad things without trembling. May I ask how one attains this?\"* Guan Yin replied: *\"This is the preservation of pure qi, not a matter of cunning, skill, or daring.\"* **[Annotation]** Utmost purity and truth are inherent in one’s nature, not sought externally. Guarding it without loss renders one invulnerable to harm—how could this be achieved through calculated bravery or reckless exposure to peril?\n\n**[Exegesis]** The perfected person’s movement through water is the accumulation of virtue, not based on emptiness—how then can they tread fire without being burned or ascend heights without trembling? This clarifies that pure qi emerges from nature; preserving spirit to align with the Dao enables such attainment. Thus, they are called perfected persons—how could this be achieved through cunning, skill, or daring? *Shiwen* notes: *\"列\"* is pronounced *liè*. *\"姬!\"* *Shiwen* notes: *\"姬\"* is pronounced *jī*. *\"Fish speaks to you.\"* **[Annotation]** *\"鱼\"* should be *\"吾\"*. Wu Kaisheng said: In ancient bronze inscriptions, *\"鱼\"* often stands for *\"吾\"*. *Shiwen* notes: *\"鱼\"* is pronounced *wú*. *\"语\"* is pronounced *yù*. *\"女\"* is pronounced *rǔ*.\n\n*\"All that possesses form, appearance, sound, or color is 'thing.'\"* **[Annotation]** From sages above to insects below, all are beings of form and sound. Observing them through form and sound reveals no absolute distinction. How then can things be far removed from one another? **[Annotation]** Xiang Xiu said: Only the mindless are truly distant. *Shiwen* notes: *\"远\"* is pronounced *yuàn*.\n\n*\"Why should any be deemed prior? They are but form and color.\"* **[Annotation]** Xiang Xiu said: All are beings of form and color—none are inherently prior. That which precedes them is only spontaneity. **[Exegesis]** All that has form is \"thing.\" All things are color—what comes after or before? Yet those who arbitrarily rank things in value are deeply deluded. Only by forgetting form, preserving spirit, cultivating stillness to generate wisdom, and thereby communing with the divine can one attain this. **[Annotation]** The character *\"形\"* is missing before *\"色\"*—it should read *\"是形色而已\"*. *\"形色\"* refers back to the earlier *\"貌像声色\"*. The annotation cites Xiang Xiu: *\"All are beings of form and color\"*—thus Xiang’s version of the *Zhuangzi* included *\"形\"*. The Jiangnan ancient *Zhuangzi* text indeed reads *\"是形色而已\"*, which should be adopted as correct. This follows Xi Tong’s *Zhuangzi Buzhu*.\n\n*\"Thus, things originate in the formless and rest where there is no transformation.\"* **[Annotation]** If existence has no beginning, then that which it creates is formless; if form has no end, then that which it rests in is unchanging. *\"造\"* is pronounced *zuò*. Lu Wenchang said: The annotation should include another *\"造\"* after *\"造音\"*. **[Annotation]** Lu’s suggestion is debatable. According to *Shiwen*, Zhang’s annotation only reads *\"造音作\"*. Zhang Zhan and Yin Jingshun both lacked understanding of phonetics, so their pronunciations are not always reliable and should not be over-scrutinized. *Shiwen* notes: *\"造\"* is pronounced *zuò*, *zàng zuò* cut, same as the annotation.\n\n*\"One who attains this and exhausts it—how could they be corrected?\"* *Shiwen* notes: *\"焉\"* is pronounced *yán*. *\"得而正焉?\"*",

      "translated_text": "Qin Enfu said: The *Shuo Wen* lacks the character *□*; it should be written as *脆* in common usage. *圮* should be written as *肥*. Thus, the *Shiwen* states that the character is an abbreviated form of *其*. The ancient form of *肥* (\"fleshy\") was written as *□*, from *□*, not from *色*.\n\nYu Yue said: The *Shuo Wen* lacks the character *□*. Under the *□* section: *□* means *毁* (\"to ruin\"). *□* and *毁* have similar meanings, so *□* is an error for *□*. Zhang’s annotation reads: *\"yin bi, fei, bo ye\"* (\"pronounced *bi*, *fei* means 'slight'\"), but it likely originally read: *\"fei yin bi, bo ye\"* (\"*fei*, pronounced *bi*, means 'slight'\"). This suggests it is read like *鄙薄* (\"slight\"). The character *□* is pronounced *符鄙切* (*fu bi qie*) in Sun Mian’s work, which matches Zhang’s reading. *□* is abbreviated as *肥*, hence the *Shiwen* states that the character is an abbreviated form of *其*. Qin Enfu, in his collated edition of Lu Chongxuan’s text, took *□* to be an error for *字*. How could it be glossed as *毁* (\"to ruin\")? The meaning would be difficult to reconcile. He likely misread Zhang’s annotation as *\"fei bo ye\"* (\"*fei* means 'slight'\") and thus proposed this explanation. If we correct the character to *□*, take its meaning as *毁* (\"to ruin\"), and its pronunciation as *鄙*, then all aspects align. Qin’s argument is incorrect.\n\n*\"You qi ting zhe mou yu chao\"* (\"Those who frequented his court were comparable to the court of Jin\").

The *Shiwen* notes: *\"jie yin jie, fu ye, cheng ye\"* (\"*jie* is pronounced *jie* and means 'secondary' or 'to match'\").\n\nAll day and night, they made this their amusement, and the state nearly became a custom.\n\n**[Explanation]**\n*\"Pian shi\"* (\"partial regard\") refers to deep glances; *\"pian fei\"* (\"partial *fei*\") refers to thick slander.

      "translated_text": "Yu Yue remarked: \"The north of the window is the very center of the chamber. Hesheng and Zibo lodged in the field watchman’s hut where Shangqiu Kai resided—surely they were within the room itself. How could Shangqiu Kai have listened from behind the north window? *Yǒu běi* likely ought to read *běi yǒu*, meaning 'facing north.' The *Mao Commentary* to the *Ode* 'Seventh Month' states: '*Xiàng* means a north-facing window'—this is correct. The two were inside the room, while Shangqiu Kai listened from outside the north window, which accords perfectly with reason. In antiquity, the chambers of both scholars and commoners all had north-facing windows, as explained in detail in *Qunjing Pingyi*.\n\nThereupon, he presented himself at Zihua’s gate, offering his labor in exchange for provisions, bearing a basket. The *Shiwen* notes: *Hè* is pronounced *hú kě*; *běn* is read as *běn*, meaning a wicker basket. Zihua’s disciples were all of noble lineage, clad in white silk, riding in carriages, pacing slowly with distant gazes. Upon seeing Shangqiu Kai—aged, frail, dark of face, his robes and cap in disarray—they could not but stare in astonishment. **[Annotation]** *Nè* is pronounced *nú gé*. Bo Jun notes: Wu Kaiseng suggests that *nè* likely means \"to gawk in surprise,\" deriving its sense from the combination of \"eye\" and \"ear.\" The *Zhonghua Da Zidian* defines it as \"to slight,\" interpreting it according to context. The *Shiwen* reads: *nè*, *nú gé*. The *Fangyan* states: \"In the regions of Yang and Yue, when people belittle one another as ignorant, they call it *nè*. *Nè* means disbelief in what one sees and hears.\"\n\nSoon after, they grew familiar and began to mock and deceive him. Wang Chongmin notes: The *Taiping Yulan* (430) writes *dài* as *gài*. The *Shuowen* states: \"*Dài* means to deceive with words\"; \"*gài* means silk labor.\" *Dài* is the original character, though later generations often substituted *gài*. The *Zhongni* chapter reads: \"I laugh at Long’s deception of Kong Chuan\"—these are among the few surviving instances of the ancient character. The *Shiwen* reads: *dài* is pronounced *dài*. The *Fangyan* states: \"To deceive one another. Originally written as *gài*.\"\n\nThey shoved, jostled, struck, **[Annotation]** *Dǎng* is pronounced *huǎng*; *āi* is pronounced *wū dài*; *dǎn* is read *dū gǎn*. The *Shiwen* reads: *dǎng*, *hú guǎng*; the *Fangyan* notes that people in Jiangdong today also call pushing *dǎng*. Alternately pronounced *huǎng*, meaning to beat. *Āi*, *wū hái*, meaning to push. *Dǎn*, *dīng gǎn*. The *Fangyan* states: \"To strike the back.\" Another version writes *kàng*, meaning to resist. and did all manner of things. The *Shiwen* reads: *wáng* is pronounced *wú*. Shangqiu Kai never showed a trace of resentment. The *Shiwen* reads: *yùn*, *yú wèn*. Meanwhile, the guests’ tricks were meager, The *Shiwen* reads: *jì*, *qú qí*; *dān* is pronounced *dān*, meaning exhausted. and they wearied of their games. **[Explanation]** To toy with and trifle with someone to the utmost; to grow familiar and slight them is to draw too near; to deceive and delude is to act recklessly; to shove is to provoke; to strike is to twist and turn; to jostle is to humiliate; to resist is to oppose. The *Shiwen* reads: *bèi*, *pú jiè*, meaning fatigued.\n\nThen they ascended a high terrace together. The *Shiwen* writes *jù chéng* as *jù shēng*, noting: *jù shēng* has an alternate version, *jù chéng*. *Chéng* means to ascend. Ren Dachun states: The *Hanshu*, in the *Biography of Zhang Tang*, reads: \"He then sent Shan to mount the barrier,\" with Yan Shigu glossing: \"*Chéng* means to ascend.\" The *Biography of Chen Tang* reads: \"Mounting the city walls, he called out,\" with Yan Shigu again glossing: \"*Chéng* means to ascend.\" The *Biography of Gong Yu* reads: \"Mounting the northern frontier watchtowers and lookouts,\" with Yan Shigu glossing: \"*Chéng* means to ascend.\" This aligns with the gloss of *chéng* as \"to ascend\" in *Jingshu*. Furthermore, the *Shiming* states: \"*Chéng* means to rise.\" The *Xunzi*, in the *Dalüe* chapter, reads: \"Hastily mounting the roof,\" with Yang Liang glossing *chéng* as \"to ascend.\" Thus, \"ascending the high terrace\" may also be written as *chéng*.\n\nAmid the crowd, one idly declared, The *Shiwen* reads: *màn*, *mò hàn*, meaning scattered. \"Whoever can cast themselves down shall be rewarded with a hundred gold pieces.\" The *Shiwen* writes *shǎng* as *cháng*, reading: *cháng* is pronounced *shǎng*. All clamored to accept the challenge. **[Explanation]** To mock him as a fool, the crowd feigned eagerness to obey. Shangqiu Kai took it as truth and leapt first, his form like a flying bird, soaring to the ground.

      "translated_text": "Scholars note: \"委曲\" means winding or bending.

The *Wen Xuan*, in the \"Rhapsody on Dance,\" states: \"Amid the decadence of the latter age, they return,\" where Yan Shigu glosses it as *wěi* (委). The *Book of Han*, in the \"Biography of Yang Xiong,\" reads: \"The followers were indistinct and could not...,\" with differing pronunciations and meanings, lacking a *□* sound. The *Yupian* states: *□*, pronounced *qúliú*, refers to well-cooked meat sauce. As for *qū* (曲), Li Shan’s commentary equates it with *wěiqū* (委曲). The pronunciations and meanings differ. The character *fú* (□) is pronounced *fúlóng*. All these relate to *wěi* (委). The *Yupian* also includes the character *□*, pronounced *huán*, citing the *Shuowen* as \"scratching a fresh wound.\" There is also a character *jī* (肌) written as *□*, where the *□* of *yīn* (音) is also written as *jī* (肌). Thus, the *□* in the *Shiwen*’s pronunciation may be an error for another character. Even modern editions remain uncertain about the transmission error in the *Shiwen*. Fan’s faction deemed it coincidental and saw no cause for suspicion. The *Shiwen* writes *jù* (讵) as *jù* (巨), noting: *ǒu* (偶) is pronounced *wǔkǒu*. *Jù* (巨) means \"great,\" with an alternate version as *jù* (讵). Ren Dachun states: In the *Book of Han*, \"Annals of Emperor Gao,\" it reads: \"If the Duke of Pei had not first broken through Guanzhong, could you have entered?\" where Yan Shigu glosses *jù* (巨) as *jù* (讵). The *Shiwen* on the *Zhuangzi*’s \"On the Equality of Things\" notes: \"Yōngjù (庸讵), where Xu’s edition writes *jù* (讵) as *jù* (巨),\" showing that *jù* (讵) and *jù* (巨) are interchangeable. This corroborates Jing Shun’s *Shiwen*, where *jù* (讵) is written as *jù* (巨).\n\nHe then pointed to the deep bends of the river’s curve and said: The *Shiwen* notes: *fù* (复) is pronounced *fúyòu*. *Yín* (淫) sounds *shēn*. *Wēi* (隈), pronounced *wūhuī*, means \"water’s bend,\" with an alternate version as *yú* (隅). \"Within lies a precious pearl; if you dive, you may retrieve it.\" The *Shiwen* notes: *yǒng* (泳) sounds *yǒng*, meaning \"to swim submerged.\" Shangqiu Kai then dove in. **[Annotation]** Swimming submerged at the water’s bottom is called *yǒng*. The *Shiwen* notes: *dǐ* (底) is pronounced *dūlǐ*. Upon emerging, he indeed obtained the pearl. The crowd was struck with doubt. **[Annotation]** *Fǎng* (昉) means \"to begin.\" The *Shiwen* notes: *fǎng* (昉) is pronounced *fēnliǎng*, or written as *fàng* (放).

The *Guangya*, in its \"Explanation of Terms,\" states: *Fāng* (方) means \"to begin.\" Thus, *fǎng* (昉) is a vulgar character, *fàng* (放) is the standard character, and both derive from *fāng* (方), meaning \"beginning.\"\n\nZihua then began to provide him with meat, grain, clothing, and silk. Soon after, a great fire broke out in Fan’s treasury. Wang Chongmin notes: The *Taiping Yulan*, fascicle 430, cites *dà huǒ* (大火) as *shī huǒ* (失火). Zihua said: \"Whoever can enter the fire and retrieve the brocade shall be rewarded according to the amount they recover.\" Shangqiu Kai went without hesitation. The *Shiwen* notes: *nán* (难) is pronounced *nǎihàn*. He entered and exited the fire, his body untouched by soot.

      "translated_text": "The faction of Fan’s clan, believing him to possess the Dao, collectively apologized to him, saying: “We did not know you possessed the Dao and thus deceived you. The *Taiping Yulan*, fascicle 430, cites this as: *‘We did not know you possessed the Dao and thus misled you; we did not know you were a divine being and thus humiliated you.’* You must think us fools, deaf, or blind. We dare ask: what is your Dao?”\n\nThe commentary explains: Descending from the terrace as if in flight, retrieving pearls from water as if on land, and entering and exiting fire unharmed—all of Zihua’s disciples regarded him as divine and in possession of the Dao. Yet here he endures deception and anger without resentment, as if we were deaf and blind. We dare ask: what is your Dao?\n\nShangqiu Kai replied: “I possess no Dao. The *Shiwen* notes: *wáng* is pronounced *wú*. Even in my own heart, I do not know the reason. The *Taiping Yulan*, fascicle 430, adds a *qí* (其) after *bùzhī* (不知). Nevertheless, there is one thing I can tell you. When those two guests lodged at my dwelling, I heard them praise the power of the Fan clan—they claimed it could make the living perish and the dead live, the rich poor and the poor rich. I believed them wholeheartedly, without doubt. Yu Yue notes: The *Er Ya*’s *Shi Gu* states: *‘Chéng* (诚) means *xìn* (信).’ Thus, *wú chéng zhī* (吾诚之) is *wú xìn zhī* (吾信之). I believed them so completely that I came without hesitation. Upon arrival, I took your faction’s words as truth, fearing only that my belief was not sincere enough. Lu Wenchang notes: The *Taiping Yulan* omits the repeated *zhī* (之) below. Bo Jun observes: This passage appears in *Taiping Yulan*, fascicle 430. I feared my actions fell short, not knowing where to place my body or where harm and benefit lay. My heart was unified, nothing more. When nothing in the external world conflicts with the mind, it is like this. Wang Chongmin notes: The Jifu edition omits the first *yǐ* (已). The *Taiping Yulan*, fascicle 430, cites *éryǐ* (而已) as *yǐyǐ* (已矣). Now that I know your faction deceived me, inwardly I harbor suspicion and doubt, while outwardly I feign composure and vigilance. I cling to the fortune of not having been scorched or drowned in the past, yet my heart burns with distress and trembles with fear. The *Shiwen* notes: *Dá* (怛) is pronounced *dīngdá* and means ‘startled.’ How could I dare approach water or fire again?”\n\nThe commentary explains: Laozi’s saying, *“Great wisdom appears foolish,”* resembles this but is not the same. One whose will is single-minded and free of other concerns, who can suddenly forget their bodily form, will find that life and death, joy and fear cannot penetrate. How much more so for one who merges with the Dao, treasures their spirit to unite with the real, whose wisdom encompasses the cosmos, and whose merit suffices for all things—how could such matters be discussed in mere fragments? But once right and wrong arise in the heart, even water and fire become unapproachable. The *Shiwen* notes: *jìn* (近) is read in the falling tone.\n\nAfter this, when Fan’s disciples encountered beggars or horse-doctors on the road, they dared not insult them but would alight from their carriages to bow. Zai Wo heard of this and reported it to Confucius. Confucius said: “Did you not know?”",

      "translated_text": "Liang Yang said: \"I am but a lowly servant—what art could I possibly teach you? Yet I fear the king may suspect I am withholding something from you, so let me speak briefly of my method for raising tigers.\n\nAll creatures with blood and qi are by nature pleased when obeyed and enraged when opposed. But are their joy and anger ever wantonly expressed? No—both arise only when their will is thwarted.\n\nWhen feeding a tiger, one must never offer it living prey, for it will grow furious at having to kill. As the commentary notes: *This is to avoid provoking its killing rage.* Wang Shu-min observes that the *Beishan Lu*’s *Yixue* chapter renders *‘its rage’* as *‘and grow enraged’*; the *Taiping Yulan* (891) and *Jizuan Yuanhai* (98) both read *‘fear its rage’*, with the same variation below.\n\nNor should one offer it whole prey, for it will grow furious at having to tear it apart. As the commentary notes: *This is to avoid provoking its exertion-induced rage.* The *Shiwen* records an alternate reading of *‘tear it apart’* as *‘rend it’*. Wang Shu-min notes that the *Shilei Fu* (20), *Jizuan Yuanhai* (98), and *Tianzhong Ji* (60) all read *‘rend it’*, as does the *Zhuangzi*’s *Renjian Shi* chapter.\n\nOne must time its hunger and satiety, and comprehend the source of its anger. As Xiang Xiu comments: *This means discerning the cause of its anger and aligning with it.* Wang Shu-min notes that the *Huainanzi*’s *Zhushu* chapter reads *‘anger’* as *‘wrath’*—*‘wrath’* pairs better with *‘hunger and satiety’*, so this reading should be followed. *‘Heart’* here is likely a corrupted form of *‘wrath’*.\n\nThough tigers and humans are of different kinds, they fawn upon those who raise them—this is obedience. Thus, when they kill, it is defiance. As the commentary notes: *They harm other beings because their will is opposed.* Lu Wenchang observes that in the Zang edition, the commentary includes an *‘and’* after *‘harm other beings’*, which may originally have been *‘due to’*. The note also ends with *‘also’*. Wang Chongmin notes that the *Zhuangzi*’s *Renjian Shi* chapter reads *‘kill’* as *‘killers’*—this should be followed. *Thus* here functions as *therefore* (see *Jingzhuan Shici*). This means that though tigers differ from humans, their fawning upon their keepers stems from having their nature obeyed, while their bloodlust arises from having it defied. Wang Shu-min suggests the original text may have read *‘Thus those who kill them do so through defiance.’* The current version omits *‘those’*, while the *Zhuangzi* omits *‘them’*—neither is complete. However, Guo Pu’s commentary already reflects this meaning, so his edition must have been uncorrupted.\n\nThen how could I dare oppose them and provoke their anger? Yet neither do I obey them to elicit their joy. For joy inevitably gives way to anger, and anger to joy—both miss the mark. As the commentary notes: *Deviating from the mean, extremes inevitably reverse—this is the natural order.*\n\nNow, my heart harbors neither opposition nor compliance, so birds and beasts regard me as one of their own. Thus, those that roam my garden do not long for lofty forests or vast marshes. As the *Shiwen* records, *‘vast marshes’* is also written *‘expansive marshes’*. Ren Dachun notes: The *Zuozhuan*’s twenty-eighth year of Duke Zhuang reads *‘guangmo’* (广莫), with the commentary glossing it as *‘a desolate expanse’*. The *Xunzi*’s *Jiebi* chapter reads *‘then how could it be vast enough to overcome it?’*, with Yang Liang noting *‘vast’* may be read as *‘desolate’*. The *Wangba* chapter reads *‘why not make it vast?’*, with Yang Liang again noting *‘vast’* may be read as *‘desolate’*. The *Hanshu*’s *Wu Wuzhi Zhuan* reads *‘how boundless is the art of deception!’*, with Su Lin glossing *‘boundless’* as *‘desolate’*. Thus, *vast* and *desolate* are interchangeable.\n\nThose that rest in my courtyard do not yearn for deep mountains or secluded valleys—this is the principle at work. As the commentary notes: *The sage’s way of nurturing all beings, allowing each to fulfill its nature, is like a trainer’s skill in raising animals without letting them harm one another.*\n\nThe *Exegesis* states: *Though forms and substances differ, their spirit and qi are not distinct. Thus, the Zhuangzi says: ‘Viewed in their differences, liver and gallbladder are as distant as Chu and Yue; viewed in their sameness, the myriad things are one body.’ The perfected person unites with them in spirit, so that birds do not scatter in flight and beasts do not disperse in herds—opposition and compliance share the same intent without conflict. Hence, fierce beasts can be tamed, and gulls can be befriended. Birds and beasts retreat to deep mountains and secluded valleys to preserve themselves, far from human harm. But if no threat exists, then what difference is there between gardens and forests?*\n\nYan Hui asked Confucius: *\"I once crossed the Goblet Depths, where the ferryman handled the boat as if by magic.\"* Sun Yirang notes: The *Shuowen*’s *Water* section defines *jin* (津) as *‘a river crossing’*; *jinren* likely refers to the officials or soldiers in charge of ferries. The *Zuozhuan*’s twenty-fourth year of Duke Zhao records: *\"Prince Chao used the treasured jades of Chengzhou to sacrifice to the Yellow River. On the jiayin day, a ferryman retrieved them from the river.\"* Liu Xiang’s *Lienü Zhuan*’s *Biantong* chapter mentions *\"Zhao Jinjuan, the daughter of a ferry official of Zhao.\"* The *Shiwen* reads *cao* (操) as *qī dāo*; the same below.\n\n*\"I asked him, ‘Can one learn to handle a boat?’ He replied, ‘Yes. Those who can swim can be taught. Those skilled in swimming often succeed.’\"* As Xiang Xiu comments: *Their skill comes naturally—this means their method ensures they are unafraid of boats.* The *Shiwen* records *‘unafraid of boats’* as *‘seizing boats’*, noting *shu* (数) is read *sè jù*, meaning *‘method’*; the commentary concurs.",

As for the diver who has never seen a boat yet masters it, this is a matter of spiritual communion—others cannot comprehend it.\n\nConfucius said: “Ah! *Yi*!” [Shiwen] *Yi* (□) is pronounced *yī*, identical to *yī* (□), an exclamatory sound. Hu Huaichen says: *Yi* (□) is the same as *yī* (噫). “You and I have long studied its text,” [Shiwen] *Wan* (玩) is pronounced *wǔ guàn*, meaning “to practice.” “yet have not grasped its reality, and thus merely discourse on the Dao.”\n\n[Annotation]\nObserving that boat-handling can be learned is merely studying its text; failing to realize that divers inherently possess the ability is not yet attaining its reality. Now I shall explain it to you. Tao Hongqing says: Zhang’s annotation, “boat-handling can be learned,” is entirely mistaken. Confucius’s meaning is that you and I have only practiced the text of principles without ever verifying them in reality, and thus fundamentally cannot comprehend the Dao. The following passage—“Master Huzi said, ‘You and I have not yet exhausted its text and reality, yet fundamentally grasp the Dao’”—with Xiang Xiu’s annotation, “Reality is revealed through text, and the Dao is manifested through affairs,” precisely captures its intent. It is suspected that *qie* (且) here should also be *de* (得); the lower half of the ancient character was damaged, leading to its misreading as *qie*. [Shiwen] *Yu* (与) is pronounced *yú*. *Wei* (为) is pronounced *yú wěi*.\n\nOne who can swim may be taught—this is due to their lightness in water. One who excels at swimming does so through technique, for they have forgotten the water. [Annotation] To forget the water is to be free of pride or fear. Lu Wenchang says: The *Zang* edition of the annotation reads, “One who forgets the water is then free of pride or fear.” Tao Hongqing says: After “one who can swim,” there should also be a *zhi* (之).\n\nAs for the diver who has never seen a boat yet acts thus in steering it, to him the abyss appears as a mound, and a capsized boat seems no different from a cart rolling backward. The overturning and retreat of the myriad things lie arrayed before him, yet none can enter his dwelling. [Annotation] This is called the dwelling of spirit. Lu Wenchang says: The *Zang* edition of the annotation reads, “This is the dwelling of spirit, thus it is called *she* (舍).” Yu Yue says: *Fang* (方) means “together.” The original meaning of *fang* is two boats side by side, hence it carries the sense of “together.” In the *Xunzi*’s “Zhi Shi” chapter, “None fail to clearly understand and rise together in pursuit of utmost perfection,” Yang’s annotation says: “Fangqi (方起) means to rise together.” In the *Han Shu*’s “Yang Xiong Zhuan,” “Though together they journey with Qiao and Woquan,” Yan Shigu’s annotation says: “Fang means to travel side by side.” Both serve as evidence. *Fang chen hu qian* (方陈乎前) means the myriad things lie arrayed together before him. Xi Diao says: Yu’s interpretation is incorrect. In the *Yi Jing*’s *Heng* hexagram, “The noble person establishes without changing *fang*.” Wang Bi’s annotation says: “*Fang* means the Dao.” *Fuque* (覆却) follows the above analogy of boats and carts; *fuque wan fang* (覆却万方) refers to the many ways in which boats and carts overturn and retreat.

      "translated_text": "Those who play with clay tiles are skillful—*Shiwen* notes: \"*Kou* (抠) means to probe; using the hand to conceal an object and probe to retrieve it is called *kou*, also termed *cangkou* (藏彄).\" *Fengtu Ji* states: \"After the sacrificial drinking on the La day, elders and children play the game of *kou*.\" Xin’s *San Qin Ji* records: \"Lady Gouyi of Han had clenched fists, and people of the time imitated her, thus naming it *canggou* (藏钩).\" *Kou* (彄) is pronounced *kou* (口侯切), and *Zhuangzi* writes it as *kou* (抠). Qin Enfu says: \"In the current edition of *Zhuangzi*, *kou* is written as *zhu* (注).\"\n\nThose who play with hooks are cautious—*Shiwen* notes: \"Hooks are made of silver or bronze.\" *Dan* (惮) is pronounced *dàn* (待汗切).\n\nThose who play with gold are confused. [Annotation] The act of mutual concealment is called *kou*. Guo Xiang says: \"The heavier the stake, the more the mind clings.\" The annotation’s \"曰\" in the *Shide Tang* edition is written as \"者,\" which is incorrect; the present version follows the *Zang* edition. Shen Chiran says: \"*Zhuangzi*’s *Das Sheng* chapter borrows this passage but changes *kou* to *zhu* (注).\" Note: *Tou* (投) means *kou*; shooting to wager is called *zhu* (注). Bo Jun notes: \"My teacher, Master Wu Jianzai, says: *Zhuangzi* writes *zhu* (注), *Lüshi Chunqiu* writes *zhu* (殶), and *Huainanzi* writes *zhu* (鉒), all phonetically similar, likely referring to the name of a winning tally in gambling.\" *Huainanzi*’s annotation states: \"*Zhu* (鉒) means *tima* (提马), the 'horse' set up for the victor in *touhu* (投壶).\" Today, local customs call the gambling tally *zhuma* (注马), a vestige of this term. *Liezi* writes *kou* (抠), treating it as the character for *cangkou* (藏彄), with a distinct meaning. *Shiwen* writes *hun* (惛) as *hun* (殙), noting: \"*Hun* is pronounced *hūn*.\" *Fangyan* says: \"Confusion is *hun*.\" *Yao* (要) is pronounced *yáo* (于遥切). *Yu* (愈) is pronounced *yǔ* (庾), meaning \"to increase.\"\n\nSkill is one—Xu Weiyu says: \"The character *qi* (其) is likely missing before *qiao* (巧).\" *Zhuangzi*’s *Das Sheng* chapter writes, \"Their skill is one,\" and *Lüshi Chunqiu*’s *Qu You* chapter writes, \"Their auspice is one,\" both including the character *qi* (其) as evidence.\n\nYet when one clings, it is an attachment to externals. All who cling to externals are clumsy within. [Annotation] Only by forgetting both internal and external, relinquishing light and heavy, can one transcend skill and clumsiness.\n\n[Exegesis] Observing the boatman reveals what may be learned, for one savors the text. But if one grasps its truth, then he regards water as land, and capsizing or drowning does not enter his mind—where could he not find leisure? Those who wager with tiles see only their skill in hitting the mark and do not fear losing the tile; if they wager with hooks, they are no longer solely focused on skill but also dread the clumsiness of losing the hook; if they wager with gold, they dare not hope to hit the mark, only fearing the loss of gold. Thus, one sees that the former marvel forgot external things, while the latter fears and clings to them. People of this age know the dual loss of clinging to externals yet covet things to the point of forfeiting their lives.\n\n\"Clumsy\" (*zhuo*, 拙) in the Northern Song edition is written as *quan* (撰), which Wang’s edition follows; other editions write *gong* (拱). Lu Wenchang says: \"*Gong* (拱) in the *Zang* edition is *zhuo* (拙), which is correct.\" The present version follows it. *Zhuangzi* also writes *zhuo* (拙). *Gong* (拱) and *zhuo* (拙) are graphically similar, hence the error. *Shiwen* writes *zhuo* (拙) as *gong* (拱), noting: \"*Gong* is originally *zhuo*.\"\n\nConfucius observed at Lüliang—Zhuang Kuiji says: There are two accounts of Lüliang. One places it in the West River. Sima Biao says: \"Lüliang is west of Lishi County.\" *Shui Jing Zhu* states: \"The river converges with a stream emerging eighty *li* southwest of the old city of Shanwu County. The water flows west, passing through the Lüliang Mountains, forming the Lüliang Rapids. Before Lüliang was opened, the river emerged above Mengmen. This was likely the passage Yu the Great opened to channel the river. Today, following the river west from Lishi County, there are no passes until reaching this point, where it becomes a great peril—this is Lüliang. It lies over a hundred *li* northeast of Lishi.\" (Bo Jun’s note: The original text of *Shui Jing Zhu* ends here; as this is an abridged citation, no quotation marks are added. The phrase \"over a hundred *li* northeast\" originally reads \"over two hundred *li* northeast,\" likely a minor error.)\n\nAnother account places it in Pengcheng. Yu Zhengxie says: The *Shuo Fu* chapter states, \"Confucius returned from Wei to Lu, rested his carriage at the river bridge, and observed it,\" which is the same event. *Zhuangzi*’s *Das Sheng* chapter refers to the river bridge as the place Confucius observed. *Shiwen* cites Sima Biao: \"Where the river is cut by rocks, now in the west of Lishi in the West River, there is such a precipitous place, commonly called Huangliang.\" *Lüshi Chunqiu*’s *Ai Lei* chapter says, \"Lüliang was not yet opened,\" and Gao You’s annotation states: \"In Lü County of Pengcheng, a great stone lies in the water, which Yu opened to clear the way.\" *Huainanzi*’s *Ben Jing* chapter says, \"Lüliang was not yet opened,\" and its annotation also states: \"In Pengcheng.\" Note: The four texts describe two different Lüliangs. The *Zhuangzi* and *Liezi* passages refer to Pengcheng, while *Lüshi Chunqiu* and *Huainanzi* place Lüliang in Lishi. The ancient annotations are thus confused.\n\n*Shui Jing Zhu* cites Confucius’s observation in its account of the Si River and Lü’s text and Sima’s account in its account of the Yellow River, which is truly comprehensive. *Zhuangzi*’s *Shiwen* states: \"Northerners call all waters *he* (河).\" Thus, the Si River may also be called *he*. *Han Shu*’s *Gou Xu Zhi* states: \"Yu split two channels; later, during the Three Dynasties, a canal was dug from the river southeast of Xingyang to form the Honggou, connecting Song, Wei, Chen, Cai, Cao, and Zheng, and meeting the Ji, Ru, Huai, and Si in Chu.\" The Si River’s bridge is thus rightly called a river bridge. Liu Fengshi of Song, in his collation of *Han Shu*, mistakenly deemed this an error. Some claim the Si River’s Lüliang originated in the Tang. *Dushi Fangyu Jiyao* states it existed in the Jin and Song dynasties, but such claims are imprecise.",

Deep water without rapids often swirls.\" *Huainanzi*’s *Ben Jing* chapter says, \"*Xuan liu hui bo* (旋流回波)\" and later, \"*qu fu zhan hui yi xiang yu yu* (曲拂邅回以象湡语).\" All swirling waters use *hui* (回), while *hui* (洄) refers to flowing against the current. *Wen Xuan*’s *Wu Du Fu* says, \"*Su hui shun liu* (泝洄顺流)\"; *Jiang Fu* says, \"*Su hui yan liu* (泝洄沿流)\"; Li Shan’s note cites the *Mao Zhuan*: \"Flowing against the current is *hui* (洄).\" *Shui Jing Zhu* says, \"Yang Yi lived at *Shanghui* (上洄), Yang Yong at *Xiahui* (下洄)\"; the water’s name *hui* (洄) distinguishes upstream and downstream, implying flowing against the current. *Hou Han Shu*’s *Ren Yan Zhuan* says, \"Every ten *li*, a water gate was built to make the flow *hui* (洄).\" Li Xian’s note cites *Erya*: \"Flowing against the current is *hui* (洄).\" Thus, *hui* (洄) and *hui* (回) have distinct meanings. However, *Erya*’s *Shi Shui* and *Shiwen* read *hui* (回) as *hui* (户恢反), also written as *hui* (洄). *Wen Xuan*’s *Qi Fa* says, \"*Zhi shi ren hui an qi chuang yan* (直使人洄暗凄怆焉)\"; Li Shan’s note: \"*Hui* (洄) is the same as *hui* (回).\" Thus, *hui* (回) and *hui* (洄) are also interchangeable. Hence, *Zhuangzi*’s *Shiwen* writes *hui* (回), while *Liezi*’s *Shiwen* writes *hui* (洄).] I follow the water’s Way without imposing my will—this is how I tread it.\"\n\nConfucius asked, \"What do you mean by beginning with what is familiar, growing with your nature, and completing it through fate?\"\n\nThe man replied, \"I was born on the hills and am at ease on the hills—this is what is familiar. [Note: *Gu* (故) means \"what is inherent.\" Following one’s true nature means being at ease with whatever one encounters.] I grew up in the water and am at ease in the water—this is my nature. [Note: Following the principles of one’s nature means nothing opposes it.] Not knowing why I am so, yet being so—this is fate.\" [Note: The principle of spontaneity cannot be known through wisdom; recognizing its unknowability is called fate.]\n\n[Exegesis] Being born on the hills and at ease on the hills, born in the water and at ease in the water—habit makes this natural. Thus, it is said: \"beginning with what is familiar\" and \"growing with one’s nature.\" Accustomed to what is familiar and at ease with one’s nature, one suddenly attains spiritual accord, completing one’s fate without self-awareness. Hence, the *Yi* says, \"Exhausting principle and fully realizing one’s nature leads to fate.\" Fate is harmony with the spiritual Way.\n\nWhen Confucius traveled to Chu, he came upon a hunchback catching cicadas in the forest. [Note: The *Shide Tang* edition writes *lou* (偻) as *lou* (慺), or sometimes as *yu* (). Ren Dachun notes: *Shuowen* says, \"*Lou* (偻) can mean *beilou* (背偻, hunchbacked).\" *Tongsu Wen* says, \"A bent spine is called *yulou* (伛偻).\" *Huainanzi*’s *Jingshen Xun* says, \"Zi Qiu was fifty-four and suffered from *yulou* (伛偻).\"]",

Liu Fengshi of Song, in his collation of *Han Shu*, mistakenly deemed this an error. Some claim the Si River’s Lüliang originated in the Tang. *Dushi Fangyu Jiyao* states it existed in the Jin and Song dynasties, but such claims are imprecise.",

      "translated_text": "Yang Liang’s annotation reads, “*Lou* (偻) means a bent spine.” The *Dixing Xun* states, “Those people have faces and *lou* (末偻),” with Yang Liang’s annotation: “*Mo* (末) means the spine.” All glosses for a curved spine use *lou* (偻). The *Yupian* states: “*Lou* (慺) means reverent and respectful, not frivolous, or humble in demeanor—it carries no sense of a bent spine.”\n\nIt is said: *Ju* (痀) is pronounced *yu* (于禹切) in modern editions, but *lou* (偻) is mistakenly written as *lou* (慺). Bo Jun notes: Ren Dachun erroneously attributed Gao You’s annotation to Yang Liang.\n\nThe *Shiwen* reads “*cheng tiao* (承蜩)” as *cheng* (承), pronounced *zhiyao* (直遥切), and also *sheyin tiao* (涉音条), with an alternate version writing *tiao* (蜩), meaning “cicada.” Ren Dachun states: The *Guangyun* reads *lou* (偻) as *lü* (缕). *Julou* (痀偻) means a hunched-back ailment. Alternate forms include *chao* (晁) and *zhao* (朝).\n\nThe *Chuci*’s *Tianwen* asks, “Why did [X] delight in *buzhou* (不周)?” with *yao* (遥) pronounced *qie* (切), and *tiao* (条) as *tuliao* (徒聊切). *Chao* (晁) shares the pronunciation of *zhao* (朝, morning). The *Tianwen* also states, “They met at *chao* (晁),” with the *Maoshi* reading, “They met at dawn (*zhao*, 朝) when the skies were clear.” The *Shiji*’s later sections and the *Hanshu*’s *Zi Cuo Zhuan* read *chao* (晁) as *zhao* (朝), with *zhuyao* (竹遥) as the fanqie. Liu Bozhuang reads it as *chao* (潮).\n\nThe *Justice* states: In the *Qin Ji*, “*Shuzhang* (庶长) may correspond to *chao zhao* (晁朝),” with *chao* (潮) as a homophone. The *Shiwen* suggests that in antiquity, *chao* (朝) meant “light.” Based on these sources, the characters *wan* (琬) and *yan* (琰) are adopted.\n\nYan Shigu states: “*Yan* (匽) is also a cicada, though the reading need not be altered.” Consulting the *Shuowen*, it reads “*tiao* (蜩),” pronounced *tiao* (条), though the origin is unclear. *Zhuangzi* writes *cheng tiao* (承蜩), while here it is written as *cheng* (承), a name for the insect.\n\nFurther consulting the *Xia Xiaozheng*: “In the fifth month, the *tangtiao* (唐蜩) sings,” with Lu Bian’s annotation: “The *tangtiao* is *yan* (匽).” It is read like *zhao* (朝). Yang Xiong’s *Fangyan* states: “*Yan* (匽)...” Lu Ji’s *Caomu Chongyu Shu* notes: “The *tang* (螗) is a large, black cicada, also called *yan* (蝘).” The *Piya* states: “The *tang* (螗) is also called *yan* (蝘). The *Xia Xiaozheng*’s *tangtiao* (螗蜩) is the same as *yan* (匽) in the *Xia Xiaozheng*—that is, *yan* (蝘蝘).” Thus, the *Shuowen*’s *yan* (匽) is identical to *cheng* (承), derived from *min* (黾), just as *ying* (蝇) and *□* are derived from *min* (黾). This is *cheng* (承). Generally, creatures of the *min* (黾) family have pointed heads and large abdomens. Cicadas also have pointed heads and large abdomens, so *yan tiao* (匽蜩) need not alter its reading.

      "translated_text": "He replied: \"I have my method. In the fifth or sixth month, if I stack two pellets and they do not fall, I lose only a trifling amount. [Note] Xiang Xiu said: Stacking two pellets without their falling demonstrates the steadiness of the hand. Thus, in catching cicadas, what is lost amounts to no more than a *zizhu* (a tiny weight). *Shiwen* writes *lei* (累) as *lei* (累), noting: *Lei* is the ancient form of *lei*. *Wan* is pronounced like *wan* (丸). Sima [Biao] said: It means stacking pellets on the tip of a pole. *Zizhu* is pronounced *zishu* (淄殊). *Tiao* is pronounced *diao* (调). If I stack three pellets and they do not fall, I lose one-tenth. If I stack five pellets and they do not fall, it is as effortless as plucking. [Note] With the hand perfectly steady, nothing is lost.\n\nMy stance is like a severed tree stump. [Note] Cui Zhuan said: *Juezhuju* (厥株驹) means a broken tree. *Shiwen* writes *juezhuju* (厥株驹) as *juezhuju* (厥株驹), noting: *Jue* is sometimes written as *jue* (橛), pronounced *qiyue* (其月切). The *Shuowen* writes it as *jue* (厥), meaning the base of a tree. Li Yi said: *Jue* means a stump. *Zhuju* also refers to the base of a withered tree. *Ju* is pronounced *ju* (俱). Cui Zhuan, whose courtesy name was Quan, was a native of Qinghe. He served as Gentleman of Discussion during the Jin dynasty and annotated the twenty-seven inner and outer chapters of the *Nanhua Zhenjing*. Ren Dachun said: Modern texts write it as *jue* (厥), which is interchangeable with *jue* (厥). The *Xunzi Dalu* states: \"A harmonious jade disk is like the *jue* (厥) of a wellside.\" The new collated edition reads *jue* as *jue* (厥), meaning the jade is as cheap as a stump. This corroborates Jing Shun’s *Shiwen*, where *jue* (厥) is written as *jue* (厥). Further evidence comes from the *Lüshi Chunqiu*: \"The mechanism of *yijue* (佁蹶)\"—the commentary explains: \"*Jueji* (蹶机) refers to the position inside a gate. The *Book of Songs* says, 'Not far from you, you see me off at the threshold'—this means no farther than the *jue* (厥).\" Thus, *yijue* (佁蹶) is the same as the gate’s *jue* (厥). *Jue* (厥) is interchangeable with *jue* (厥) and also with *jue* (蹶). Additionally, *zhuju* (株驹) appears in the *Zhuangzi Dasheng* as *zhujou* (株拘). The *Shiwen* cites Li [Yi] as saying: \"*Jue* (厥) means a stump, like *zhujou* (株拘).\" The *Yilin* states: \"Meng grows *zhuqu* (株瞿), thorns snag my beard.\" Since it mentions \"Meng grows\" and \"thorns,\" these too are types of trees. *Zhuju* (株驹), *zhujou* (株拘), and *zhuqu* (株瞿) are all phonetic variations of the same term. Further evidence comes from the *Shanhai Jing*: \"Below are the Nine *Ju* (拘)\"—the commentary explains: \"Their roots are tangled.\" The *Huainanzi* says: \"Great roots are *jue* (擢).\" Pronounced *qu* (劬). Thus, *ju* (驹), *ju* (拘), *qu* (瞿), *ju* (枸), and *□* all carry the meaning of a tree’s tangled base.\n\nMy arm is like the branch of a withered tree. Wang Shumin said: There should be a *ye* (也) after \"I grasp my arm,\" to match the structure of the preceding sentence. The *Zhuangzi Dasheng* indeed includes *ye* (也). Though heaven and earth are vast and the myriad things are numerous, I am aware only of the cicada’s wings. I do not turn or shift my focus; I do not exchange the cicada’s wings for the myriad things. How could I fail to succeed?\"\n\n[Note] Guo Xiang said: By relinquishing that, one attains this.\n[Explanation] Initially, when learning to stack pellets, one does not succeed. After half a year of practice, one can stack two without their falling. With continued practice, why can one eventually stack five without their falling? My body is like a stump, my arm like withered wood, my mind single-minded and fixed, free from distracting thoughts. Though the myriad things are many, my awareness rests solely on the cicada’s wings. How could I fail to succeed?\n\nBo Jun noted: *Ce* (侧), *yi* (翼), and *de* (得) rhyme, all belonging to the ancient *zhide* (职德) rhyme group.\n\nConfucius turned to his disciples and said: \"When the mind is undivided, it approaches the divine.\"\n[Note] *Fen* (分) means scattered. When intent is focused, it resembles the divine.\nLu Wenchang said: The *Zang* edition writes *yi* (疑) as *ning* (凝), as does the *Zhuangzi*.\nJiao Xun said: The *Guanzi Neiye* states: \"Think and think again, then think once more. If thinking does not lead to understanding, ghosts and spirits will make it clear. It is not the power of ghosts and spirits but the culmination of essence and *qi*.\" Thinking repeatedly is \"using the mind without division.\" \"Ghosts and spirits will make it clear\" is \"approaching the divine.\"\nYu Yue said: The *Daozang* edition writes *yi* (疑) as *ning* (凝), as does Lu Chongxuan’s edition and the *Zhuangzi*. However, this character should actually be *yi* (疑), meaning \"to astonish like ghosts and spirits.\" The earlier passage where Confucius says, \"I took you for a ghost, but upon closer inspection, you are human,\" also supports the reading \"approaching the divine.\" The *Guanzi Xingshi* states: \"Without breadth, it is *yi* (疑).\" The *Shenjie* says: \"Using compass and square to make circles and squares brings success; using measuring tools to determine length brings accuracy; governing the people with laws and numbers brings peace. Thus, affairs not broad in principle succeed as if by divine means.\" This is precisely what \"using the mind without division approaches the divine\" means. For further discussion, see *Zhuangzi Pingyi*.\nTao Hongqing said: Yu Yue’s argument is sound. Zhang’s commentary states: \"When intent is focused, it resembles the divine,\" indicating that the text he saw originally read *yi* (疑), not *ning* (凝).\nWang Shumin said: The *Yungu Yaji* and *Tianzhong Ji* also write it as *yi* (疑). *Yi* (疑) means \"to resemble.\" The *Zhuangzi Tiandi* states: \"You are not one of those broadly learned men who resemble the sages.\"",

      "translated_text": "The *Huainanzi*'s \"Chuzhen\" chapter also writes it as *yi* (疑), which is precisely this comparison.\n\nBo Jun notes: Tao Hongqing used Zhang’s commentary as evidence, supplementing what Yu Yue had not fully addressed. In fact, Yu Yue in his *Zhuangzi Pingyi* had already cited this as corroboration. Moreover, the phrase \"resembling\" as used by Confucius became a set expression, which is why the various masters all employ this wording. Ancient set expressions often featured rhyme, and here *shen* (神) and *nai* (乃) form a *zhen-wen* rhyme (as in *Laozi* Chapter 15, where *chuan* [川] and *lin* [邻] rhyme; the *Liji*'s \"Kongzi Xianju,\" where *shen* [神] and *xian* [先] rhyme; the *Book of Songs*' \"Zhengyue,\" where *lin* [邻] and *yin* [殷] rhyme; the *Yijing*'s \"Song\" hexagram, where *ren* [人] and *chuan* [川] rhyme; the *Chuci*'s \"Tianwen,\" where *fen* [分] and *shen* [神] rhyme; the \"Yuan You,\" where *tian* [天] and *wen* [闻] rhyme; and the *Xunzi*'s \"Yun Fu,\" where *sun* [损], *wen* [文], *shen* [神], *men* [门], *cun* [存], and *chen* [陈] rhyme—examples are too numerous to list exhaustively). *Zhen* belongs to Duan Yucai’s twelfth rhyme group, and *wen* to the thirteenth, making their rhyme the closest possible, which is the principle at work here.\n\nCould this be what the hunchbacked elder meant?\n\n**[Explanation]**\nTo focus the mind without distraction is to *congeal* in spiritual union. The Master, however, referred to the elder’s failure to forget the cicada’s wings, hence \"congealing in the divine\"—not that he had attained spiritual union.\n\nThe elder said: \"You are but a disciple in flowing robes.\"\nSun Yirang notes: *Fengyi* (逢衣) refers to the wide-sleeved robes described in the ritual classics. Zheng Xuan’s commentary on the *Zhouli*’s \"Sifu\" states: \"The sleeves of a *shi*’s robe are two *chi* and two *cun* in length, joined to the garment, with cuffs of one *chi* and two *cun*. For *dafu* and above, the sleeves are made wider. To widen them, one takes half the original measurement and adds one part. Thus, the sleeves become three *chi* and three *cun*, and the cuffs one *chi* and eight *cun*.\" The *Shiwen* reads *ru* (汝) as *nü* (女), glossing it as *ru* (汝). The *Liji*’s \"Ruxing\" chapter states: \"When I lived in Lu in my youth, I wore robes with wide sleeves.

      "translated_text": "The annotation states: *Xiu* (修) means \"to cultivate.\" It speaks of cultivating the arts of benevolence and righteousness that you employ, returning to the natural Dao, and only then may you bear these words upon yourself.\n\nThe exegesis reads: The disciples of the Master are all scholars of the *fengye* robe, employing benevolence and righteousness to teach and transform the world. Yet they cause the world to clamor after fame and profit, exhausting their wisdom and thoughts, losing their true nature, and wearying their spirit and clarity—what do they know of inquiring into this Dao? You who transmit texts to later generations, do you again wish to employ the eloquence of clever speech to bear this Dao upon written words?\n\nQin Enfu said: The final character *ran* (然) in the exegesis is likely a scribal error for *yan* (焉).\nYu Yue said: Zhang’s annotation does not grasp the meaning. Reflecting on the old man’s words, his disdain for Confucian arts is extreme—how could he urge one to cultivate such arts? *Xiu* (修) means \"to sweep away.\" The *Zhouli*’s \"Dian Si\" states: \"He leads his subordinates in sweeping away [impurities],\" and Zheng’s commentary explains: \"*Xiu chu* means to clear and sweep,\" which is its meaning here. The \"Si Zun Yi\" further states: \"*Xiu zhuo*,\" and the commentary of the Minister of Agriculture reads: \"To wash the ladle with water and then pour.\" That washing with water is called *xiu* also carries the sense of sweeping away. Thus, this passage’s *xiu ru suo yi* means that what you employ should be swept away, and only then may you bear my words upon yourself.\nWang Shumin said: Master Yu is correct in taking *xiu* as *xiu chu* (\"to sweep away\"), but he has not grasped the meaning of *zai* (載). *Zai* means \"again.\" It speaks of sweeping away what you formerly employed, and only then may you speak of loftier things again.\nLin Xiyi’s *Kouyi* states: \"*Zai yan* means to speak anew,\" which best captures its meaning. The *Zhuangzi*’s \"Rang Wang\" chapter reads: \"The Master was twice expelled from Lu,\" and the *Taiping Yulan* (486) cites it as *zai*, providing evidence that *zai* and *zai* (\"again\") are interchangeable.\nWu Kaisheng also said: It speaks of first cultivating what you practice and only then seeking loftier things—Zhang’s annotation is in error.\n\nThere was a man from the seaside who was fond of gulls. (Bo Jun notes: The *Lüshi Chunqiu*’s \"Jing Yu\" chapter reads \"fond of dragonflies,\" and the same below.) The *Shiwen* reads: *Hao* (好) is pronounced *hu bao*. *Ou* is pronounced *ou*.

Bring them here so that I may enjoy them.\" The *Shiwen* notes: In one version, \"bring them here\" is written as \"you may bring them here.\"\n\nThe next day, when he went to the seashore, the gulls danced in the air but would not descend.\nThe annotation states: When the heart stirs within, the form changes without; even birds perceive it—how could human principles be feigned?\n\nBo Jun notes: The *Annotations to the Records of the Three Kingdoms* in the *Biography of Gao Rou* quote Sun Sheng as saying, \"When the mind harbors calculation, gulls will not descend.\" Thus, the story of gulls originally existed, and the forger of the *Liezi* borrowed it. Sun Sheng was nearly contemporary with Zhang Zhan and likely never saw this *Liezi*. Hence it is said: Perfect words transcend speech. The *Shiwen* notes: *Qu* (去) is pronounced *qǔ* (丘吕切). Perfect action is non-action. What is known by the equalization of wisdom is but shallow.\nThe annotation states: Only when all speech is forgotten do things harbor no suspicion. To be limited by what wisdom knows is to miss the mark by far.\n\nSome have doubted whether the old man feigned his form to catch cicadas, while the seaside boy, trusting in harmony, drew gulls to him—these two cases seem opposed yet equally avoid offending things. The foundation of their words lies in their distinct purposes. Though they appear contradictory, they converge in the same truth: the old man demonstrated that when the mind is single-mindedly focused, one can avoid startling creatures—how much more so when one attains natural oblivion, becoming like wood or stone? As for the seaside boy, his sincere heart filled his inner being, and his openness manifested outwardly. Though he did not forget both benefit and harm or eliminate all suspicion, he lightly regarded the strangeness of other species, finding little to marvel at. These two analogies borrow the near to illustrate the distant, using the branch to clarify the root.\n\nThe explanation states: Spiritual union transcends reason, not emotional knowledge. When knowledge arises, even flesh and blood suspect one another; when principle arises, all things are without barrier—only then can one discern the subtlest truths. To unite with all things lies in spiritual union; to unite with living beings lies in the extinction of emotion. To pride oneself on one’s heart and wisdom is to distance oneself from the Dao.\n\nThe annotation’s \"the old man feigned his form\" (*wei*, 为) is written as *wei* (伪, \"falsely\") in the Northern Song edition and the Zang edition; the version with *wei* (为) has greater meaning.

The *Shiwen* notes: *qiào* (窍) is pronounced *kǒu diào qiè* (口吊切). His breath and voice were those of a man. He asked, \"By what *Dao* do you dwell in stone? By what *Dao* do you enter fire?\"\n\nThe man replied, \"What thing do you call stone? What thing do you call fire?\" The annotation states: This shows he was utterly unaware of stone or fire—what thing could obstruct him?\n\nViscount Xiang said, \"That from which you emerged just now was stone; that which you traversed just now was fire.\" The *Shiwen* notes: *xiàng* (向) is pronounced *xiàng* (向).

Roaming through metal and stone, treading water and fire—all are possible.\"\n\nMarquis Wen said, \"Why do you not do this?\" Zixia said, \"To hollow out the heart and cast off knowledge—\" The *Shiwen* notes: *kū* (刳) is pronounced *kū* (枯). *qù* (去) is pronounced *qiū lǚ qiè* (丘吕切). \"—I have not yet been able to do so. Nevertheless, I can speak of it when I have leisure.\" The annotation states: To use the heart to hollow out the heart, to borrow knowledge to cast off knowledge—though the burdens of heart and knowledge may be truly exhausted, the traces of what has been relinquished still remain. This makes clear that the ultimate principle cannot be realized through the use of the heart; speaking of it, however, leaves one with ample leisure.\n\nThe commentary states: The previous chapter spoke of roaming through water without obstruction; this chapter clarifies that fire and stone do no harm. It notes that many are accustomed to water, but few tread fire, lest one’s nature become biased. Thus, it speaks again of fire to elucidate this. One who inwardly forgets his own form and outwardly forgets things does not know what obstructs stone or harms fire.\n\nMarquis Wen, not understanding, raised the question, while Zixia, who had long known, answered well. Thus, Marquis Wen pressed further: since you know it, why do you not practice it?

As for the sage—what does he do? What does he not do? What is he capable of? What is he incapable of? He bows and rises with the customs of the world, ascends and descends in accord with things. Extraordinary deeds and wondrous traces are never for a moment displayed; the sublime subtleties within his being are not one in ten thousand perceived.\n\nFrom the beginning of this scroll to this chapter, the Dao of following one’s nature and destiny is made clear: not to be bound by the five emotions, to concentrate the qi and attain suppleness, to be sincere in heart without duality—thus one may pass through water and fire without scorching or drowning, tread upon wood and stone without snagging or stumbling, touch blades and edges without injury or harm, traverse peril and danger without falling or tumbling. The myriad things do not oppose his heart; entering among beasts, he does not disturb their herds. His spirit may wander alone, his body may rise lightly; his ears may hear with perfect clarity, his eyes may see with penetrating illumination.\n\nThese words are not conventional, and in truth they startle the common mind. Therefore, let us discuss it: Yin and Yang transform in alternation, the Five Agents nurture in imbalance. Metal and Earth give birth as mother and child; Water and Fire overcome one another through dryness and moisture. Human nature diverges in stillness and agitation; ascent and descent differ in their capacities and dispositions. Thus there are winged creatures that soar through clouds, scaled creatures that lurk in the depths, rats that move through fire, and insects that dwell in wood. Why is this? Hard and soft, heat and cold—each has its proper place.",

      "translated_text": "Those content with one domain are constrained in all others. As for the perfected person, their mind merges mystically with primordial qi, their body harmonizes darkly with Yin and Yang. Squares and circles do not conform to a single form, warmth and coolness do not settle in a single vessel. With spirit settled and qi harmonized, all they ride submits to them—thus the Five Agents cannot oppose them, cold and heat cannot harm them. This is called the depth of embodied virtue, the perfection of harmony. Therefore, they constantly dwell beyond the realm of death—how could they need to deliberate over approach or withdrawal to preserve wholeness?\n\nTreading water and fire, riding clouds and mist, traversing perilous heights, entering the midst of weapons—these are hardly worth marveling at.\n\n[Annotation] The Master’s abilities that he did not exercise were employed to uphold the Dao of benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and the proper order of ruler and minister to rescue a declining age—not merely to cultivate his own person among flocks of birds and beasts.\n\n[Collation Notes] Zhang Hua’s *Bowu Zhi* records this matter in nearly identical terms. Another note: The commentary’s \"perfected person\" appears as \"sage\" in the Shide Tang edition. The *Shiwen* renders  as 碍, with the pronunciation *yue*. 强 is read as *qí liǎng*. 着 is read as *zhí lüè*. 挂 is pronounced *guà*. 碍 originally appeared as . 颠 is read as *dū nián*, meaning \"to fall.\" 偏 is pronounced *piān*. A divine shaman from Qi arrived and resided in Zheng. The *Shiwen* states: males are called *xí*, females *wū*. Yan Shigu notes: *wū* and *xí* are also used interchangeably. His name was Ji Xian. [Collation] The *Xunzi*’s \"Zhengming\" chapter reads, \"Only then does one follow and name it,\" and \"If the reality is not understood, then name it; if the name is not understood, then set a time\"—Yang’s commentary interprets *ming* as \"name\" in both cases. The *Zhuangzi*’s \"Dazongshi\" chapter reads, \"There is nothing with which to name it,\" and the *Shiwen* cites Cui’s commentary: \"*Ming* means name.\" The *Zuozhuan* under Duke Huan’s second year states, \"The ruler named the heir *Chou* and his younger brother *Chengshi*,\" and under the sixth year, \"At his birth, he was of the same kind as I, so I named him *Tong*.\" In all cases, *ming* is glossed as \"name.\" Thus *ming yue Ji Xian* means his name was Ji Xian. Another note: The *Huainanzi*’s \"Dixing Xun\" states, \"Wu Xian is in the north,\" with Gao’s commentary: \"Wu Xian knows the Dao of Heaven and clarifies good and ill fortune.\" The *Shiwen* states: Ji Xian, with the surname Ji and given name Xian, was a man of Zheng. [Collation] The *Zhuangzi*’s \"Ying Diwang\" chapter reads, \"In Zheng there was a divine shaman named Ji Xian,\" and the *Huainanzi*’s \"Jingshen Xun\" reads, \"The divine shaman of Zheng, Xiang Huqiuzi Lin, saw his signs\"—hence the *Shiwen* identifies Ji Xian as a man of Zheng. He knew the life and death, survival and demise, fortune and misfortune, long life and early death of others, predicting them by year, month, ten-day week, or day with divine accuracy. The *Tianzhong Ji* (vol. 40) and *Jingchuan Baibian* (vol. 65) both insert a \"之\" after \"知人.\" Wang Xianqian says: Whether by year, month, ten-day week, or day, none failed to prove divinely accurate. [Collation] Wang’s reading of \"ten-day week and day\" as a single phrase is incorrect. Each of \"year,\" \"month,\" \"ten-day week,\" and \"day\" stands alone, meaning predictions could be made by any of these. When the people of Zheng saw him, they all fled to avoid him. [Commentary] Xiang Xiu says: They disliked hearing their own death dates. The *Shiwen* notes: One variant reads \"abandoned\" instead of \"avoided.\" 喜 is pronounced *xǐ jì*. Liezi saw him and was enchanted. [Commentary] Xiang Xiu says: He was bewildered by his Dao. Returning, he told Huqiuzi, [Commentary] The *Shiwen* states: Huzi was Liezi’s teacher. saying, \"At first I took the Master’s Dao as ultimate, but now there is something even more ultimate.\" [Commentary] Guo Xiang says: He meant that Ji Xian’s attainment surpassed even the Master’s. The *Shiwen* notes: 过 is pronounced *gē*. Huqiuzi said: \"I have practiced the outward forms with you, but you have not yet grasped their essence—how could you have truly attained the Dao? [Collation] Lu Wenchang says: The \"无\" in the Zang edition appears as \"既\"; the commentary suggests \"无\" may be correct, though the *Zhuangzi* also uses \"既.\" Yu Yue says: \"无\" should be \"\", read as *guàn* (to penetrate), as \"贯\" and \"\" were originally the same character. The *Erya*’s \"Shigu\" glosses *guàn* as \"to practice.\" The *Huangdi* chapter reads, \"You and I have long played with its outward forms but have not yet reached its essence,\" with the *Shiwen* glossing *wán* (玩) as *xí guàn* (习贯, to practice). Thus here \"\" (practice) corresponds to *wán* (玩) there—both are phonetically close and share the same meaning. Due to scribal error, it became \"\", and later scholars replaced it with \"无,\" rendering the passage unintelligible. Lu Chongxuan’s edition reads \"既其文未既其实,\" following the *Zhuangzi*’s revision, but this is not the original text of the *Liezi*. Wang Shuqin says: \"I have practiced the outward forms with you, but you have not yet grasped their essence\"—whether \"既\" or \"无,\" the meaning remains unclear. The earlier passage where Yan Hui asks the ferryman about boat-handling reads, \"You and I have long played with its outward forms but have not yet reached its essence\"—*wán* (玩) is the superior reading. It is likely that \"既\" here is a corruption of *wán* (玩), and the second \"既\" should also be *wán*. The \"无\" variant arose when *wán* (玩) degraded into *yuán* (元), and scribes altered it to \"无.\" The *Shiwen* notes: \"无\" appears as \"无\" in some editions, while others use \"既,\" though the latter is less meaningful. A flock of hens without a rooster—how could they lay eggs?\" [Commentary] Xiang Xiu says: Essence is made manifest through form, and the Dao is revealed through affairs. To possess the Dao without engaging in affairs is like having hens without a rooster. Though you and I differ in depth, we both occupy the realm of essence—thus no outward forms emerge to reveal it. Therefore, you have not yet fully grasped the essence of my Dao. This speaks to how the perfected person’s song must await a response before harmonizing. [Collation] The *Huainanzi*’s \"Lanming Xun\" states: \"Thus the utmost Yin is howling, the utmost Yang is blazing—when the two interact and harmonize, the myriad things are born.\"",

      "translated_text": "Listening, he went out and said to Liezi: \"Your master is not in a state of fasting—\"\n\n**Annotation:**\nSome versions omit the character \"坐\" (sitting).\nXiang Xiu says: \"Wherever one goes, all is level, merged into oneness. Those who peer at heaven through a tube see no bounds; thus, he is not in a state of fasting.\"\n\nLu Wenchang notes: The annotation \"管\" appears as \"筦\" in the *Zang* edition. Below \"故以,\" a \"为\" should be added.\nThe *Shiwen* writes \"斋\" as \"齐,\" pronounced *zhāi* (侧皆切), with the same pronunciation below.\n\n\"I can find nothing by which to assess him. Try fasting, and I will observe him again later.\"\n\nLiezi entered and reported this to Master Hu. Master Hu said: \"Just now, I showed him the Great Vastness without trace—\"\n\n**Annotation:**\nXiang Xiu says: \"Abiding in the utmost of the Great Vastness, the mind is vast and still, darkly one with the ten thousand directions, leaving no trace.\"\nThe *Shiwen* writes \"太\" as \"大,\" pronounced *tài*. *眹* is pronounced *zhěn* (直引切), meaning \"sign.\"\n\n\"This is nearly seeing my balanced qi.\"\n\n**Annotation:**\n*衡* means \"level.\"\n\n\"Where the *ní* fish coils—\"\n\n**Annotation:**\nPronounced *fān*.\n\n\"—is the abyss.\" Ji Di says: \"*潘* should be *沈*, the character for *shěn*. *沈* is the original form of *湛*. The *Shuowen* states: *湛* means \"to submerge.\" By extension, it carries the sense of depth. *沈* and *湛* are ancient and modern forms; today, *沈* is commonly used for *湛*. *渊*, according to the *Shuowen*, is \"revolving water,\" depicted with water radicals, its shape suggesting banks on either side and water in the center. The *Guanzi*’s *Du Di* chapter states: \"Water that emerges from the earth but does not flow is called an abyss.\" Thus, an abyss is where water pools and deepens. The *Shijing*’s *Wei Feng* commentary glosses *渊* as \"deep,\" and *沈* as an abyss further emphasizes this depth. The *Liji*’s *Tan Gong* reads: \"For the *yú* tree’s *shěn*, a dredge was set,\" where *shěn* is *shěn*. Here, however, *shěn* is *shěn*. *Zhuangzi* writes it as *审*. When *沈* is missing a stroke, it becomes *潘*; when *水* is missing, it becomes *审*. Errors arise easily, but the traces remain discernible.\n\nThe *Shiwen* writes \"旋\" as \"桓,\" pronounced *huán* (胡官切), meaning \"to linger.\" One version writes it as *旋*, meaning \"to coil.\" *潘* is pronounced *pān*; originally *蟠*, referring to the swirling of water. Now written as *蟠*, likely a scribal error. *鲵* is a large fish; *桓* means \"to linger\"; *蟠* means \"to swirl.\" This describes how a great fish’s lingering and coiling creates a deep spring. The *Nanhua Zhenjing* writes it as *审*. Liang Jianwen states: *蟠* means \"to gather.\" Ren Dachun notes: Mountains and waters named *桓* all carry the sense of coiling. The *Shui Jing Zhu* states: \"*桓* is the name of a mountain slope; its path coils and winds upward, hence the name *桓*.\" Slopes named *桓* and waters named *桓* both derive from the sense of coiling, corroborating the *Shiwen*’s *旋* written as *桓*. The words *盘桓* were often glossed as \"to revolve\" in ancient times. The *Yi*’s *Zhun* *Shiwen*, citing Ma Rong, states: \"*盘桓* means 'to revolve.'\" Thus, the *桓* in *盘桓* in the *Liezi* is also written as *旋*. Further, in the *Zhuangzi*’s *Ying Di Wang* *Shiwen*, *鲵桓* is glossed by Sima Biao as \"two fish names,\" while Jianwen states: \"*鲵* is the whale; *桓* means 'to linger.'\" Cui’s version writes it as *鲵拒*, glossing it as \"the square cave where fish dwell.\" Another note states: \"*拒* may be written as *桓*.\" Thus, *鲵桓*’s *桓* is written as *旋* in the *Liezi* *Shiwen* and as *拒* in the *Zhuangzi* *Shiwen*.\n\nAnother note: Lu Jingshun’s *Shiwen* states that *潘* was originally *蟠*, referring to the swirling of water, and that the current *蟠* is likely a scribal error. However, this interpretation is somewhat forced. The *蟠* in \"now written as *蟠*\" may be a corruption of *潘*. Yet in the *Zhuangzi*’s *Ying Di Wang* *Shiwen*, *鲵桓*’s *审* is glossed by Sima Biao as *蟠*, meaning \"to gather,\" while Cui’s version writes it as *潘*, glossing it as \"the domain where swirling water congeals.\" The *Guanzi*’s *Wu Fu* chapter states: \"Guide floodwaters, benefit ponds and ditches, and dredge *潘* islets,\" with the annotation: \"*潘* means 'to overflow.' *渚潘* overflows, so dredge them to allow flow. *潘* is pronounced *pān*.\" The supplementary annotation states: *潘* refers to swirling overflow. The *Guangya* states: \"*潘* is *fúyuán*, meaning 'to surge.'\" Thus, *蟠* and *潘* each have their basis and are not incorrect. It remains unclear which character the *蟠* in Lu Jingshun’s *Shiwen* is a corruption of.\n\nFurther, the *Yupian* states: \"*瀊* means 'to swirl,'\" from which Lu Jingshun’s *Shiwen* derives its *瀊洄*. The *Guanzi*’s *Xiao Wen* chapter writes it as *盘桓*.\n\n\"—where still water pools is an abyss; where flowing water pools is an abyss; where overflowing water pools is an abyss—\"\n\n**Annotation:**\n*滥* is pronounced with the rising tone (咸上声). The *Erya* states: \"Water gushes forth.\"\n\n\"—where cascading water pools is an abyss—\"\n\n**Annotation:**\n*沃* is pronounced *wù* (乌仆切), referring to water springing from above and flowing downward.\n\n\"—where lateral springs pool is an abyss—\"\n\n**Annotation:**\n*氿* is pronounced *guǐ* (轨), referring to water springing from the side.\n\n\"—where dammed water pools is an abyss—\"\n\n**Annotation:**\n*雍* is pronounced *yōng* (拥), referring to river water bursting forth and then returning.\n\n\"—where stagnant water pools is an abyss—\"\n\n**Annotation:**\nPronounced *qiān* (牵), referring to water that does not flow.\n\n\"—where fertile water pools is an abyss—\"\n\n**Annotation:**\nWater with unusual origins is called *肥*.\n\n\"—these are the Nine Abysses.\"\n\n**Annotation:**\nThe names and meanings of these nine waters appear in the *Erya*. Water is one, yet depending on whether the terrain is high or low, smooth or rugged, it swirls, rushes, flows, or stills differently—just as the mind of the perfected person, in response to external things’ difficulty or ease, exhibits movement or stillness, advance or retreat. Xiang Xiu says: \"Whether water flows or stills, whether the *ní* fish coils or the dragon leaps, the abyss remains ever thus, never losing its quietude.\"",

      "translated_text": "Guo Xiang says: \"The perfected person acts when employing the Way and stills when setting it aside. Though waves surge through nine transformations, and order and chaos swirl in confusion, one who abides in the ultimate remains ever tranquil and self-possessed, drifting in non-action.\"\n\n**Explication:**\nThe mind moves with the qi of the Great Thoroughfare, vast and traceless, formless yet ever-shifting—like water assuming myriad names in its transformations, yet never departing from the clarity of the abyss. Thus, its form cannot be grasped or described.\n\n**Annotation:**\n\"Nine transformations\" (*jiǔ biàn*): The Northern Song edition reads \"all transformations\" (*fán biàn*); Wang’s edition follows this, but the present text adopts the Zang edition’s correction.\n**Pronunciations:**\n*Huí* (洄) is pronounced *huí*.\n*Yì* (易) is pronounced *yì* (with the *shì* rhyme).\n*Shě* (舍) is pronounced *shě*.\n*Dàn* (澹) is pronounced *dàn* (with the *làn* rhyme).\n*Bó* (泊) is pronounced *bó*.\n\n\"Come again tomorrow!\"\n\nYu Yue says: The preceding text reads, *\"This must be seeing my power of virtue in its subtlety—come again tomorrow,\"* and again, *\"This must be seeing my goodness in its subtlety—come again tomorrow.\"* Thus, this passage should read, *\"This must be seeing my qi in equilibrium in its subtlety,\"* followed immediately by *\"Come again tomorrow,\"* to maintain consistency. The interpolation of the Nine Abysses here is superfluous. I suspect these fifty-eight characters are a misplaced slip from elsewhere. In the *Zhuangzi*’s *\"The Emperor of the World\"* chapter, only the first three abysses are listed, and it concludes, *\"The abyss has nine names; these are three of them,\"* precisely because they are irrelevant to the passage’s meaning. This confirms that the version of the *Zhuangzi* seen by its author already matched the present text—errors in ancient books are long-standing.\n\nThe next day, he again met with Master Hu.

      "translated_text": "Where land yields abundant profit, all people vie for it. The nature of the common person may rise or fall. Knowing that fame and gain cannot be forced, one advances goodness to cultivate oneself. The *Odes*, *Documents*, ritual, and music—these affairs are not easily mastered. Yet if one retreats to seclusion, stills the heart and extinguishes cleverness, eschewing the lure of ostentation, one gains the reputation of a good person. Thus, at the gate of Dao-learning, whether one’s inclinations are good or bad, the noble person purifies the heart, while the petty person reforms the self. Though they may not fully grasp the Way, they still derive benefit from following goodness. Hence it is said: “Others will safeguard you.”\n\nWang Lai notes: In the exegesis “risk death in reverence,” *death* should read *prior*. Tao Hongqing says: *Safeguard* means *entrust*; it speaks of others placing trust in one, just as the *Liezi* states, “They will entrust me with affairs and demand results from me.” Zhang’s annotation, glossing it as “safeguarded wherever one goes,” is quite untenable. Wang Chongmin says: In Zhang’s note, “If one violates this principle,” *violates* should read *attains*, an error due to graphic similarity. The *Zhuangzi*’s “Ren Jian Shi” chapter reads, “Timing their hunger and satiety, attaining their angry hearts,” while the *Huainanzi*’s “Zhu Shu” chapter mistakenly writes *violates*—this serves as evidence. Xi Tong says: *Abide* should be glossed as *examine*, as explained in detail in Wang Yinzhi’s *Jingyi Shuwen*. *Abiding in oneself* means examining oneself. The *Shiwen* states: *Safeguard* means *attach*. Before long, he went, and the shoes outside his door were filled. The annotation says: Those who returned to him were indeed many.

      "translated_text": "\"Indeed, I told you before: others would preserve you, and they have indeed preserved you. Yet it is not that you can make others preserve you. [Annotation: If one interacts with things in accord with the principle, then things will naturally preserve one. Now, turning against the principle to move things, one seeks their preservation—but it cannot be obtained.] The *Lu Chongxuan* edition of the *Qin* carving omits the character *you* after 'make others preserve.' It is likely that the omission is correct.\" *Shiwen* notes: *bei* is pronounced *pei*.\n\n\"But you cannot make others not preserve you. [Annotation: Guo Xiang says: If one acts with equanimity and transforms, then there is no stirring, no seeking. Without stirring or seeking, there is no mutual preservation.] [Exegesis: Your withdrawal, your integrity, your renunciation of learning and wisdom—these are why others preserve you, not because you can summon them. If you could erase your traces and merge with the real, concealing both foolishness and wisdom, others would not know to preserve you. Thus, your conduct merely suffices to make others preserve you, yet you cannot make them cease. Why then do you stir them? [Annotation: What method do you employ to move things so?] *Shiwen* notes: *yan* is pronounced *yu-qian*.\n\n\"Stirring them, you produce anomalies. [Annotation: Guo Xiang says: Bestowing favors before things move—such favors do not arise from their prior movement but are anomalous.] The *Qin* edition reads 'responding in advance' instead of 'stirring in advance.' The final *zhe* in the annotation appears as *ye* in the *Northern Song* edition; here, it is corrected according to the *Zang* edition.\" *Shiwen* notes: *xian* is pronounced *xi-jan*.\n\n\"Moreover, there must be stirring, and in shaking, the root of the self. [Annotation: *Shiwen* notes: An alternate version reads 'shaking the root of one’s nature.'] It is also meaningless. [Annotation: If one constantly makes things stir one, then the natures of self and other are set in motion and altered.] Xu Weiyu says: In 'Moreover, there must be stirring,' *bi* ('must') should be *xin* ('heart'), the error arising from graphic similarity. The heart and the root of the self proceed in tandem; if the heart is stirred, it necessarily shakes the root of the self (the root of the self meaning one’s fundamental nature). Thus, the preceding text speaks of externally stabilizing the human heart to □ its affliction. The affliction refers to the heart being moved by things, thereby shaking the root of the self. The *Lie Yukou* chapter of the *Zhuangzi* contains the same error. Wang Chongmin says: *Shen* ('self') has the sense of *xing* ('nature'), for *shen* and *xing* were interchangeable in antiquity. 'Root of the self' is thus equivalent to 'root of one’s nature.' The *Lie Yukou* chapter of the *Zhuangzi* reads 'shaking the root of one’s talent.' *Shiwen* notes: 'An alternate version reads *xing* ('nature') for *cai* ('talent').' Both *cai* characters are errors for *shen*. The *Huainanzi*'s *Yuandao* chapter states, 'Thus one who has attained the Dao does not alter Heaven with man,' with Gao You’s commentary: 'Heavenly nature.' Another gloss says, 'Heavenly self.' 'Heavenly self' is thus equivalent to 'heavenly nature.' The *Sanguozhi*'s commentary on the *Wu Zhi* biography reads: 'The supreme general’s true nature was stout; the central commander-in-chief Zhu Shuo’s nature was lean.' 'Nature stout' and 'nature lean' are thus equivalent to 'self stout' and 'self lean.' The *Zhuangzi* commentary by Guo Xiang says, 'If there must be stirring, then it moves one’s fundamental nature'—this is correct.\" Bo Jun notes: Wang’s interpretation of 'root of the self' as 'root of one’s nature' is correct. However, the *Zhuangzi*’s 'root of one’s talent' is not an error. *Cai* should be read as in the *Mencius*' *Gaozi I*: 'It is not that Heaven has sent down a talent different from yours.' Talent is thus nature.\" *Shiwen* notes: *yi* is pronounced *yi-chi*.\n\n\"Those who wander with you can tell you nothing. [Annotation: They are all followers who shake the root; they cannot enlighten one another.] The annotation originally read 'not all' in Wang’s edition; here, it is corrected according to the *Northern Song* and *Zang* editions.\n\n\"Their petty words are all poison to others. [Annotation: Petty words are subtle and clever, easily stirring others, and thus harmful to them.]\n\n\"None awaken, none comprehend—how can they examine one another?\" [Annotation: They cannot mutually perfect or aid one another.] [Exegesis: What Dao do you employ to stir them?]",

      "translated_text": "When he first arrived, the innkeeper and his family came out to greet him. [Annotation:] The host family of the inn. The *Daozang* editions all include the character *zhe* 者 after *she* 舍, except the *Sijie* edition and Wang’s edition, which correctly omit it. Yu Yue notes: *She* 舍 and *she zhe* 舍者 are not the same. Below, it says “the inn guests rose from their mats” and again “the inn guests now vied with him for mats,” both referring to fellow travelers at the inn. Here, *she* 舍 refers to the innkeeper, just as the one who oversees the market is called *shi* 市, and the one who oversees farming is called *tian* 田. The *Liji*’s “Wangzhi” chapter glosses *shi* 市 as “the one who oversees the market,” and its “Yueling” chapter glosses *tian* 田 as “the official in charge of agriculture.” These are analogous examples.\n\nThe master held the mat, and his wife held the comb and mirror. The inn guests rose from their mats, and those warming themselves moved away from the hearth. [Annotation:] When one conceals one’s distinction with excessive modesty, others are daunted by it. Lu Wenchang notes: The character *cang* 藏 in the annotation likely should be *zun* 尊. [Pronunciation note:] *Yang* 炀 is pronounced *yang*. Sima Biao comments: *Yang* 炀 means to face the fire. The *Huainanzi* states: “The rich wear embroidered silks; the poor warm themselves at the hearth’s mouth.”\n\nWhen he returned, the inn guests now vied with him for mats. [Annotation:] When one makes oneself equal to others, others feel no aversion. [Exegesis:] The true recluse makes no boastful claims and bears no air of self-importance. Thus, when Master Yang first arrived, people welcomed and saw him off; but after hearing good counsel and changing his ways, even the inn’s residents now competed with him for mats. The previous chapter spoke of Liezi’s ability to make others protect you, while this chapter shows how Yang Zhu could make others cease protecting you.\n\nWang Chongmin notes: The *Taiping Yulan* (709) includes the character *zao* 灶 before *xi* 席. Comparing this with the earlier phrase “the inn guests rose from their mats, and those warming themselves moved away from the hearth,” it seems the original text likely included *zao* 灶. Wang Shumin notes: The *Taiping Yulan* (709) reads *yang zhe* 炀者 instead of *she zhe* 舍者, and includes *zao* 灶 before *xi* 席. It is likely that the original text had *yang zhe* 炀者 after *she zhe* 舍者 (or before it), and *zao* 灶 before *xi* 席. The phrase “the inn guests and those warming themselves now vied with him for hearth and mats” encompasses both “the inn guests rose from their mats” and “those warming themselves moved away from the hearth.” The *Taiping Yulan*’s version likely omits the two characters *she zhe* 舍者. [Pronunciation note:] *Wu* 恶 is pronounced *wulu*.\n\nYang Zhu passed through Song and stayed at an inn. The innkeeper had two concubines: one beautiful, the other plain. The plain one was honored, while the beautiful one was slighted. Yang Zhu asked the reason. The innkeeper’s young servant replied—[Annotation:] The *Hanfeizi*’s “Shuolin Shang” reads: “The innkeeper’s father answered”—“The beautiful one is beautiful in her own eyes, but I do not see her beauty.

Observe what is accumulated, and you will know the direction of fortune and misfortune.\n\n[Annotation:] Fortune and misfortune arise from what is accumulated.\n\nStrength that overcomes what is not equal to oneself will, when it reaches what is equal, become brittle.\n\n[Annotation:] It will surely break.\n\nWu Kaisheng says: *Gang* (刚, \"hardness\") should be written as □, hence the annotation reads \"it will surely break.\"\n\nWang Shumin says: The *Huainanzi*’s *Yuandao Xun* includes the word *zhe* (者, \"that which\") after \"not equal to oneself\" (文子 *Daoyuan* chapter likewise), making the sentence structure consistent with the following text; this should be followed.\n\nSoftness that overcomes what surpasses oneself has a power that cannot be measured.\n\nYang Bojun notes: The words of *Yuezi* cited here also appear in the *Huainanzi*’s *Yuandao Xun* and the *Wenzi*’s *Daoyuan* chapter, though neither attributes them to *Yuezi*. Additionally, *gang* (刚, \"hardness\"), *qiang* (强, \"strength\"), *xiang* (乡, \"direction\"), and *liang* (量, \"measure\") rhyme, all being words of the *yang* rhyme group in ancient pronunciation. The *Huainanzi*’s *Quan Yan Xun* reads: \"Strength that overcomes what is not equal to oneself will, when it reaches what is equal, be obstructed; softness that overcomes what surpasses oneself has a power that cannot be measured,\" rhyming *ge* (格, \"obstructed\") and *du* (度, \"measured\").\n\nLaozi said: \"When weapons are strong, they perish.\n\n[Annotation:] Wang Bi says: That which all things detest cannot endure to the end.\n\nWhen wood is strong, it breaks.\n\n[Annotation:] When strength reaches its extreme, it is destroyed.\n\nYang Bojun notes: The *Daodejing* (Chapter 76) reads: \"When weapons are strong, they are not victorious; when wood is strong, it is felled.\" Yu Yue, Yi Shunding, and Ma Xulun all argue that the *Liezi* version should be followed, as detailed in *Laozi Hegu*.\n\n*Mie* (灭, \"perish\") and *zhe* (折, \"break\") rhyme, both being words of the *zhi* rhyme group in ancient pronunciation.\n\nThe soft and weak are the companions of life; the hard and strong are the companions of death.\"\n\n[Explanation:] The *Junzi* says: \"Those who are overbearing do not meet a natural death; those who love to conquer will surely encounter their match. Accumulating virtue and piling up benevolence is the Way of softness.\"\n\nYang Bojun notes: This also appears in the *Daodejing* (Chapter 76). Additionally, in the Northern Song edition and Wang’s edition, \"companions of death\" (*si zhi tu*, 死之徒) reads \"companions of transformation\" (*hua zhi tu*, 化之徒); here, the reading follows the Zang edition and the Shidetang edition. Furthermore, the *Hanfeizi*’s *Jie Lao* chapter states: \"*Tu* (徒) means *shu* (属, \"to belong\").\" Thus, *tu* here should also be glossed as *shu*.\n\nIn appearance, one need not be childlike, yet wisdom may be childlike; in wisdom, one need not be childlike, yet appearance may be childlike. The sage embraces childlike wisdom and discards childlike appearance, while the common people cling to childlike appearance and distance themselves from childlike wisdom. Those whose appearance resembles mine are near and beloved; those whose appearance differs from mine are distant and feared.\n\n[Annotation:] *Tong* (童, \"childlike\") should be written as *tong* (同, \"same\").\n\nWu Kaisheng says: Taking *tong* (童) as *tong* (同).\n\nThough possessing a seven-foot frame, distinct hands and feet, hair on the head and teeth in the mouth, standing and moving—this is called a human. Yet humans are not necessarily without the hearts of beasts. Even with the hearts of beasts, by appearance they are deemed kin.\n\nWith wings attached and horns borne, fangs spread and claws arrayed, flying aloft or crouching to run—this is called a bird or beast. Yet birds and beasts are not necessarily without the hearts of humans. Even with the hearts of humans, by appearance they are deemed distant.\n\nFuxi,\n\n[Annotation:] *Pao* (庖) is pronounced *pao* (匏); *xi* (牺) is pronounced *xi* (许宜切).\n\nNüwa,\n\n[Annotation:] *Wa* (娲) is pronounced *gua* (瓜).\n\nFuxi and Nüwa were both ancient emperors.\n\nShennong, and the Xia Hou clan had the bodies of serpents and human faces, the heads of oxen and the noses of tigers—these possessed non-human appearances yet held the virtue of great sages.\n\n[Annotation:] Human forms naturally include some resembling birds and beasts; many ancient sages had extraordinary appearances. The so-called \"bodies of serpents and human faces\" does not mean they were scaled and belly-crawling without limbs; \"heads of oxen and noses of tigers\" does not mean they bore horns, had hanging dewlaps, broad foreheads, or loose jaws—just as physiognomy describes \"tortoise backs,\" \"crane strides,\" \"kite shoulders,\" or \"hawk beaks.\"\n\n[Annotation:] *Yi* (臆) is pronounced *yi* (亿); *man* (曼) is pronounced *wan* (万); *e* (頞) is pronounced *e* (乌葛切, \"bridge of the nose\"); *han* (颔) is pronounced *han* (胡感切, \"jaw\"); *xiang* (相) is pronounced *xiang* (息亮切); *hu* (鹄) is pronounced *he* (鹤); *yuan* (鸢) is pronounced *yuan* (缘); *hui* (喙) is pronounced *hui* (许秽切).\n\nJie of Xia, Zhou of Yin, Huan of Lu, and Mu of Chu had the seven apertures of human appearance yet possessed the hearts of birds and beasts. Yet the common people cling to a single appearance in pursuit of supreme wisdom—this is hardly attainable.\n\n[Explanation:] What makes different beings kin is spirit. When spirit departs, even the bond between father and child becomes estranged. Thus, spending a night of terror under the same roof as living creatures brings no fear, for their spirits are the same. Dwelling in an ordinary house with a corpse in the same room induces terror, for their spirits differ. Though the dead and the living share the same form as before, one feels at ease while the other is afraid—this is because those of the same kind have departed, and the form is no longer kin. Yet humans, unaware that all living things share the same spirit despite differing forms, assume worry and fear. To base kinship and distance on the similarity or difference of appearance is delusion. Thus, Zhuangzi says: \"What all things share is spirit; therefore, spirit is the master of nurturing life.\"\n\nYang Bojun notes: Duke Huan of Lu killed his elder brother to seize the throne, and Duke Mu of Chu killed his father to seize the throne—hence they are said to have the conduct of birds and beasts. The *Explanation* cites Zhuangzi, but this passage does not appear in the current text. In the Qin dynasty engraving, \"spending\" (*ju*, 居) is written as \"after\" (*hou*, 后); here, it follows the *Sijie* edition.\n\n[Annotation:] *Ji* (几) is pronounced *ji* (冀).\n\nThe Yellow Emperor and the Flame Emperor battled at the wilds of Banquan,\n\n[Annotation:] *Ban* (阪) is pronounced *ban* (蒲阪切). Banquan is in Shanggu.\n\nleading bears, brown bears, wolves, leopards, lynxes, and tigers as their vanguard.\n\nYang Bojun notes: *Chu* (貙) refers to a large tiger.",

Here, we follow the Northern Song edition, the Jifu edition, the *Taiping Yulan* (918), and the *Yiwen Leiju* (91) for correction. The *Zhuangzi*’s *Dasheng* chapter records the same. Bo Jun notes: In the twenty-fifth year of Duke Zhao’s reign in the *Zuozhuan*, the cocks of the Ji and Hou clans fought, where the Ji clan fitted their cock with spurs, and the Hou clan gilded its spurs. The *Lüshi Chunqiu*’s *Qu You* chapter and the *Huainanzi*’s *Renjian Xun* also contain this passage. Cockfighting in antiquity was akin to modern cricket-fighting. The ancient *yuefu* and Tao Qian’s *Returning to Dwell in Gardens and Fields* say, “Cocks crow atop the mulberry trees.” Du Zimei’s *Three Poems from Qiang Village* reads: “The flock of cocks clamors in chaos; guests arrive as the cocks fight. Driving the cocks up the trees, only then do I hear the knocking at the brushwood gate.” In the Tang, cocks could still perch in trees, but today few can. In recent times, cockfighting persists in Guangdong and southern Hunan. The *Explanation* reads *Ji Xiaozi* as *Ji Shengzi*, noting: the surname is Ji, the given name Sheng (or Xiao, pronounced *suǒ jǐng*). *Wei* is pronounced *yú wěi*.\n\nAfter ten days, the king asked, “Are the cocks ready to fight?”\nHe replied, “Not yet. They are still hollowly proud and reliant on their qi.”\n[Annotation] Those without substance who vaunt themselves.\n\nAfter another ten days, the king asked again.\nHe replied, “Not yet. They still respond to shadows and echoes.”\n[Annotation] Their reactions are swift.\nLu Wenchang notes: The annotation “swift” in the *Zangwai* edition reads “rapid.”\nThe *Explanation* reads “swift” as “rapid,” noting: *xiang* is pronounced *xiǎng*.

Confucius and Mozi, though without land, became rulers; *Shiwen* notes: “翟 is read as *Di*.” Mo Di, a grandee of Song who lived after Confucius, composed seventy-one chapters advocating filial piety, reverence for spirits, strengthening the root and moderating expenditure—also a remedy for the world’s ills; he possessed arts of attack and defense. Though without office, they became leaders; the Qin edition reads “office” as “palace.” *Shiwen* notes: “长 is read as *zhǎng*.” Not a man or woman under Heaven failed to crane their necks and stand on tiptoe, yearning to dwell in peace and benefit under them.\n\nNow Your Majesty is lord of ten thousand chariots; the *Lüshi Chunqiu* reads “ten thousand chariots” as “one thousand chariots.” If you truly hold such aspiration, then within the four borders— the Qin edition reads “竟” as “境.” *Shiwen* notes: “竟 is read as *jìng*.”—all would receive its benefit.

      "translated_text": "The *Annotation* states: That which receives existence and is called \"form\" is born; that which bends and rises in ceaseless alteration is called \"transformation.\" Where the spirit intermingles is called \"dream\"; where form engages is called \"waking.\" Tracing them to their utmost, they converge in emptiness and artifice. Why? The substance of life is rooted in stagnation, enduring a hundred years before its end; the passions of transformation branch shallowly, vanishing in the blink of an eye. The Dao of spirit is dim and indistinct, now present, now absent; the principles of form are manifest and evident, now real, now solid. Thus one who perceives deeply knows the principle of arising and ceasing is equal, the paths of waking and dreaming are one; though ten thousand changes unfold in profusion, they do not touch the spirit’s contemplation. The deluded, confounding the manifest and the obscure, take the slowness or swiftness of verification as cause for doubt, and so cling to the self, regarding the bodily frame as their true dwelling. Who recognizes that the root and return of life and transformation lie in nothingness?\n\nThe *Elucidation* states: Heaven and earth form vessels, encompassing all things. Human beings live within them, yet only preserve their existence; they never realize that spirit governs form, and the insubstantial is not constrained by the substantial. This is why the sage nurtures the root, while the foolish know only to nurture the branch. They constrict form to sustain life, coveting life yet unaware of life’s master; they take the decay of form as death, unaware that spirit and consciousness endure forever. The deluded remain ordinary, while the enlightened attain sagely wisdom. The confused are many, so the text first speaks of the enlightened to clarify the distinction.\n\nWang Lai notes: In the *Elucidation*, \"the insubstantial is not constrained by the substantial\" should read \"the substantial is constrained by the insubstantial.\" Qin Enfu notes: In the *Elucidation*, the character \"branch\" is missing before \"constricts form.\" Bo Jun’s note: In the *Annotation*, after \"one who perceives deeply,\" the character \"者\" should be added. The *Shiwen* reads \"blink of an eye\" as \"blink of an eye,\" and \"dim and indistinct\" as \"elusive and indistinct,\" and notes: *俛* is pronounced *miǎn*. *觉* is pronounced *jiào*. *怳* is pronounced *huǎng*. *惚* is pronounced *hū*. Regarding the time of King Mu of Zhou, the *Shiwen* states: King Mu of Zhou was named Man, son of King Zhao.\n\nIn the kingdom of the Western Extremity, there came a *huaren*—a being of transformation and illusion. Bo Jun’s note: The *Shu Chao* (Vol. 129), *Tai Ping Yu Lan* (Vols. 173, 626) quote \"Western Extremity\" as \"Western Regions.\" The *Yi Wen Lei Ju* (Vol. 62) quotes it as \"Western Hu.\" The *Shiwen* notes: *幻* is pronounced *huàn*. They entered water and fire, pierced metal and stone; they reversed mountains and rivers, relocated cities and towns. Riding the void, they did not fall; encountering the solid, they met no obstruction. Their thousand changes and ten thousand transformations could not be exhausted. Having already altered the forms of things, they further transformed people’s thoughts—temporarily causing them to forget their long-held knowledge and perceptions. King Mu revered them as spirits and served them as lords.\n\nThe *Elucidation* states: The concerns of ordinary people extend no further than cravings and aversions, fame and profit, benevolence and righteousness. The *huaren* now returns them to their true nature, hence it is called \"transformation.\" The *huaren* is a body responsive to all things. Exhausting principle and perfecting wisdom, their responses are boundless; their thousand changes and ten thousand transformations have no end. King Mu offered them a secluded chamber to reside in, presented the three sacrificial animals, and selected female musicians to entertain them. The *huaren* deemed the king’s palace crude and unfit for dwelling, his kitchen fare rank and foul and inedible—Hu Huaichen notes: \"蝼\" should be \"偻,\" with the characters \"偻\" and \"膻\" transposed. It should read: \"The king’s palace was crude and unfit for dwelling, his kitchen fare rank and foul and inedible, his consorts and attendants deformed and repulsive and unlovable.\" The *Shiwen* notes: *腥* is pronounced *xīng*. *蝼* is pronounced *lóu*. *飨* is pronounced *xiǎng*. The *Zhou Li*, \"Offices of Heaven,\" \"Nei Yong\" states: \"That which is rank and inedible: horses with black spines and patterned forelegs, and *lóugū*.\" Zheng Xuan comments: \"Patterned forelegs refer to fur with natural markings. *Lóugū* is the stench of mole crickets.\" Modern readers should follow the *Zhou Li*’s *Yong Shi*. *饔* is pronounced *yōng*. *般* is pronounced *bān*. Bo Jun’s note: The current edition of the *Fang Yan* still reads \"蝼蛄,\" not with the \"女\" radical. The king’s consorts and attendants were rank and repulsive and unlovable.\n\nThe *Elucidation* states: To deem the king’s palace crude, his kitchen fare rank, and his consorts and attendants foul is to show that the *huaren* does not value sensory pleasures, flavors, or dwellings. Yu Yue notes: *膻* should be *膻*, meaning foul and unlovable. The *Guang Ya*, \"Explanation of Utensils,\" states: \"膻 means foul.\" The *Shiwen* notes: *膻* is pronounced *shān*. King Mu then had it rebuilt for them. Wang Shu Min notes: The *Rong Zhai Si Bi* (Vol. 3) includes the characters \"palace chambers\" after \"built.\" The labor of earth and timber, the *Shiwen* notes: *乃* is written as *乃*, an ancient form of *乃*. *为* is pronounced *wěi*.

His attendants saw the king sitting in silence, with no coming or going, and so for three months, the king sat in forgetfulness, not daring to ask.\n\n**Qin Enfu’s note:** The character \"聖\" (*shèng*) in the exegesis is an error, possibly a superfluous addition.\n\n**Bo Jun’s note:** In the exegesis, the phrase \"肴未昲\" (*yáo wèi fèi*)—in the Qin edition, \"未\" (*wèi*) was written as \"夫\" (*fū*)—has been corrected here according to the *Sijie* edition.\n\nThe *Huaren* said, \"I traveled in spirit with Your Majesty—how could the form have moved?\n\n**[Annotation]** That which is called \"spirit\" moves without haste yet arrives swiftly, goes without walking yet reaches its destination. To illustrate with a common example: in a single night’s slumber, one may dream of a hundred years’ events or see things from the farthest realms. While awake, in the brief span of a bow and a stretch, one may touch what lies beyond the six directions. If even wayward thoughts and wanton fancies can achieve this, how much more so when the spirit moves alone, unconfined by form or vessel, perfectly penetrating and mysteriously illuminating, serene and concentrated in emptiness?\"\n\n**[Shiwen]** \"覺\" is pronounced *jiào*.\n\n\"Moreover, the place where I dwelt before—how is it different from Your Majesty’s palace? The places where I wandered before—how are they different from Your Majesty’s gardens? What you are accustomed to remains, and you doubt only its temporary absence.\n\n**[Annotation]** Both that and this are not true things. To grow accustomed to what is always present and doubt its momentary absence—this is the delusion of the heart.\"\n\n**Qin edition:** \"王閒恒疑攓亡\" (*Wáng xián héng yí qiān wáng*). In other editions, the character \"有\" (*yǒu*) is omitted after \"恒\" (*héng*). Here, it has been added following the *Shidetang* edition.\n\n\"閒\" (*xián*) means \"to be accustomed.\" \"恒有\" (*héng yǒu*) corresponds to the annotation’s \"常存\" (*cháng cún*, \"always present\"). \"閒恒有\" (*xián héng yǒu*) and \"疑暫亡\" (*yí zàn wáng*) form a parallel structure.\n\n**[Shiwen]** \"閒\" is pronounced *xián*, meaning \"to be accustomed to what is always present.\" One variant omits the character \"有\" (*yǒu*).\n\n\"At the extreme of transformation, in the space between slow and swift, can it be fully grasped?\"\n\n**[Annotation]** Transformation cannot be exhausted, and the principle of slow and swift admits no gap. To seek its image or model with the intellect is beyond measure.\n\n**[Exegesis]** The marvel of the spirit’s distinction from form is thus further clarified. The king, accustomed only to what he habitually saw, doubted its temporary absence. But for the person of the utmost Dao, who constantly forgets their form, what doubt could there be? The spirit’s transformations, whether slow or swift, cannot be fully expressed.\n\n**[Shiwen]** \"模\" is written as \"摸\" (*mō*), pronounced *mó*.\n\nThe king was overjoyed. He neglected state affairs,\n\n**[Shiwen]** \"恤\" is pronounced *xù*.\n\nTook no delight in his ministers or concubines,\n\n**[Annotation]** Moved by these profound words, he abandoned the governance of worldly affairs and forgot the hierarchy between ruler and subject.\n\n**[Shiwen]** \"治\" is pronounced *zhì*.\n\nAnd indulged in distant wanderings.\n\n**[Exegesis]** In Zhuangzi’s discourse, those who value the Dao abandon the world without a backward glance—what concern have they for it? Thus, it is like treating dust, chaff, or husks as the clay from which Yao and Shun were molded. Who would take such things as matters of importance? Moreover, to be drowned in the allure of sounds, colors, and desires—how could this be the way of one who delights in the Dao? The king’s joy in the Dao led him to neglect state affairs and take no pleasure in his ministers or concubines. His \"distant wanderings\" meant forgetting what was near and familiar.\n\n**In the exegesis, \"陶鑄\" (*táo zhù*) was originally written as \"陶懤\" (*táo chóu*), but has been corrected here according to the *Sijie* edition.**\n\nHe ordered the harnessing of the eight steeds:\n\n**[Shiwen]** \"駿\" is pronounced *jùn*. \"乘\" is pronounced *shèng*, and the same applies below.\n\nThe right-hand trace horse was □\n\n**[Annotation]** The ancient character for \"驊\" (*huá*).\n\n**Lü** (*liú*), and the left-hand trace horse was **Lü’er** (*Lǜ ěr*).

Here, □ has been altered to □, and □ to □, with the left and right reversed, rendering it unrecognizable (originally from Zhang Wenhu’s *Shu Jutang Suibi*).

The *Mu Tianzi Zhuan* writes it as \"左白儀\" (*zuǒ bái yí*), with Guo Pu’s note reading, \"The ancient character for *yì*.\" Thus, the annotation explains □ as *xī*, which is a corruption of the character *yí*. □ is not the character *xī*.\n\n**Sun Yirang’s note:** \"白□\" appears twice in the *Mu Tianzi Zhuan*, once written as *yì* and once as *yí*. Guo Pu also states, \"The ancient character for *yì*,\" which matches Zhang’s annotation. The *Guangya*’s \"Explanation of Livestock\" lists a horse type called *lù*, possibly a loan for this character. The current text writes it as □. While Hong Yi suggests it corresponds to the *Erya*’s *déjiǎn yáng*, the forms are somewhat similar, but this reading does not align with the *Mu Tianzi Zhuan* or Zhang and Guo’s pronunciations, and may not be accurate.\n\n**[Shiwen]** \"□\" is written as \"牺\" (*xī*), pronounced *yì*. \"驂\" is pronounced *cān*. \"驥\" is pronounced *jì*.\n\nThe *Records of the Grand Historian* states: \"Zaofu obtained for King Mu the horses *Huáliú*, *Lǜ ěr*, *Chì jì*, and *Bái xī*, with which he drove on his travels, visiting the Queen Mother of the West and delighting in her company until he forgot to return.\" This account is largely consistent with the *Mu Tianzi Zhuan*.",

      "translated_text": "Guo Pu’s annotation states, \"All are named after their coat colors.\" Later, there are *Qúhuáng*, *Yúlún*, *Dàolí*, and *Shānzǐ*, making the Eight Steeds. For the main chariot, Zaofu served as charioteer, and □□ as the right-hand attendant.\n\n**[Annotation]** \"The upper part resembles *qí* (齊), and the lower part resembles *hé* (合); this is an ancient character, but its exact form remains uncertain.\"\nSun Yirang notes: \"The *Shiwen* writes '□' as '□', stating: '□ is pronounced *tài*, and its seal script form is □.' □ should be written as □, with the upper part resembling *dà* (大) and □, akin to the upper half of *qí* (齊); the lower part, derived from *shuǐ* (水), has become *hé* (合), which is a considerable deviation. Yin Yun’s seal script form □ is also a scribal error. The original Zhang annotation likely matched the *Shiwen*, hence the note 'the upper part resembles *qí*, and the lower part resembles *hé*.' This annotation should originally have been placed under '□,' indicating that the character’s upper part resembles *qí* (in fact, following the *Shiwen*, it is an abbreviated form of *qí*), and the lower part resembles *hé*. Since no ancient character dictionary records this form, and neither its shape nor sound can be explained, it is labeled 'uncertain.' Though Zhang and Yin’s versions erroneously wrote □ as □, the pronunciation *tài* remained correct. The phrase 'the upper part resembles *qí*, and the lower part resembles *hé*' specifically describes the form of □ and is unrelated to its pronunciation, much less to the character □. In other versions, □ was further corrupted into □ (the upper *qí* became □, and the lower *hé* became *jiǒng*), losing its resemblance to *qí* and *hé*, while this annotation was mistakenly moved beneath the character □. Readers, unfamiliar with the original text, could not decipher it and thus split the annotation—originally describing the form of □—into the pronunciations of □ and □. This error was adopted from a variant cited in the *Shiwen* (Yin’s version had not yet corrupted the character □, so it is unlikely there was no correction; perhaps this entry in the *Shiwen* was interpolated by Chen Jingyuan?). Later, Ding Du’s *Jiyun* and Han Daozhao’s *Wuyin Jiyun* followed this interpretation, including □ under the *qí* initial and □ under the *hé* initial—a case of ancient texts being repeatedly miscopied and losing their original form to such an extent.\n\n**[The *Yupian* under the *gōng* (弓) section includes the character □, stating: \"Pronounced *húhé* (胡合切), meaning 'to meet.' This is also a corruption of □. This entry was certainly not part of Gu Yewang’s original work but was recklessly added by later Song scholars.]**\n\nThe *Shiwen* cites the Stone Classics as writing '□' as '□' (based on the Wei *Three-Script Stone Classics*; this is the ancient form of the character *bǐng* (丙). Neither Guo Zhongshu’s *Hanjian* nor Hong’s *Lixu* includes this character among the surviving fragments of the Stone Classics, and it cannot be verified today). This also does not form a recognizable character. Speculatively, the ancient script in the Stone Classics likely originally wrote it as □ (Ruan Yuan’s *Jigu Zhai Zhongding Kuanshi* records the *Zhōu Hū dǐng*, where the character □ is written as □, and *bǐng* (丙) is written in this form. The *Stone Drums*’ *Yǐ gǔ* simplifies the character □ by omitting □, making its form even more complete). This likely represents a reduplicated form of *bǐng* (古籀文 often employs reduplication, as in *wǔ* (五) written as □, *bèi* (贝) as □, and *chē* (车) as □). In clerical script, it should be written as □, but through scribal corruption, the upper *bǐng* became □, and the lower *bǐng* became *zhǐ* (只), rendering it unrecognizable. The *Zilin* writes it as *xī* (西), which should be *bǐng* (丙); this is the seal script form of *bǐng*, with an extra stroke mistakenly added below. The *Mu Tianzi Zhuan* writes '□□ as the right-hand attendant,' which is also a scribal error.\n\n**Further note:** \"For the main chariot, Zaofu served as charioteer\"—since Zaofu was the charioteer, he should not also be the one who 'presided over the chariot.' The phrase 'presided over the chariot' should include the character *wáng* (王). The king rode in the chariot, thus the king presided over it; in the next chariot, the king did not ride, so Boyi was designated to preside over it instead. The *Mu Tianzi Zhuan* writes 'the Son of Heaven presided over the chariot,' which serves as definitive evidence. The current text omits the character *wáng*, making it seem as if the one who presided over the chariot was also the charioteer, which does not correspond to the next chariot.\"\n\nWang Shumin states: \"The current text’s omission of the character *wáng* is correct. However, *wáng* should likely precede 'presided over the chariot,' so that 'the king presided over the chariot' matches the syntax of the following phrase, 'Boyi presided over the chariot.'\"\n\nThe *Shiwen* writes '□' as '□,' stating: \"Zaofu is pronounced *zàofǔ* (七到切). *Fù* is pronounced *fǔ*. The *Records of the Grand Historian* states: 'King Mu of Zhou rode the horses *Huáliú* and *Lǜ ěr*, with Zaofu as his charioteer, traveling a thousand *li* in a day.' □ is pronounced *tài*, and its seal script form is □. □ is pronounced *bǐng*, and the Stone Classics write it as □.\"",

      "translated_text": "The *Zilin* states that *yǐn* is written as □, originally as □□, with the pronunciation *qí* for the upper character and *hé* for the lower—yet this offers no meaningful interpretation. The *Huainanzi* states: \"Qián and Jǔ Tàibǐng were charioteers, who removed the reins and bit, discarding the whip and goad.\" Gao You comments: \"These were ancient masters of the Dao skilled in driving.\" *Qián* is pronounced *qíyán* (其炎切), and *jǔ* is pronounced *zǐyú* (子余切).\n\nRen Dachun writes: \"□\" is written as \"□.\" The preface by Chen Jingyuan of the Song dynasty states that \"□□\" are the two characters \"Tàibǐng,\" indicating that the text Jingyuan saw wrote \"□\" rather than \"□,\" matching the current edition. Only the *Shiwen* writes □, preserving the ancient form. Wu Renchen states: \"In the *Shilin Yanyu*, Wang Qi of the Tang did not recognize the two characters □□. Now, examining the *Liezi*, □ is pronounced *bǐng*, but the source of the character □ remains unattested. Moreover, Wang Shizhen’s rendition of the two characters as □□ appears to be an error.\" Wu Renchen knew that the character □ derived from the *Liezi* but claimed that □ had no attested source—this is because he had only seen the current edition of the *Liezi* and not Lu Deming’s *Shiwen*.\n\nThe *Tongya* cites Tu Weizhen’s preface, which states: \"During the Tang, scholars debated □□, with only Wang Qi, Wang Yuanmei, and Hu Mingrui writing it as □ (a corruption of □) and □ (a corruption of □). Thus, what Wang Qi saw still rendered □□ as □□, hence his claim of not recognizing the two characters □□.\" Comparing this with Lu Deming’s *Shiwen*, which also writes □□, it is evident that in Tang-era editions, □ was often written as □. Though Wang Yuanmei and Hu Mingrui’s □□ is a scribal corruption of □□, the *Shiwen*’s original form as □□ can still serve as evidence for textual reconstruction.\n\nHowever, the *Shiwen* further states that beneath the character □, the original text reads \"□,\" with □ pronounced *qí* and □ pronounced *hé*—yet this offers no meaningful interpretation. Lu Deming likely meant that another edition wrote □□ as □□, where the upper □ is pronounced *qí* and the lower □ is pronounced *hé*, differing not only in the variant characters □□ but also in the pronunciation of *qí-hé* for □□ versus *tàibǐng* for □□.\n\nThe *Wuyin Jiyun* records: □ is pronounced *cúxī* (徂奚切), sharing the same initial as *qí*; □ is pronounced *húlà* (壶腊切), sharing the same initial as *hé*. This confirms that one edition reads □ as *qí* and □ as *hé*. However, since the *Huainanzi* writes it as *Tàibǐng*, while this edition reads *qí-hé*, which offers no meaningful interpretation, the definitive text writes □ as *tài* and □ as *bǐng*, not following the variant edition.\n\nFurther examination of the *Mu Tianzi Zhuan* reveals: \"□□ served as the right attendant.\" Since □ resembles □ and □ resembles □, scribal errors arose. Sun Yirang notes: In the *Shiwen*’s citation of the *Zilin*, \"云\" should be \"音.\" The *Yiqie Jing Yinyi* (Vol. 6) quotes the *Zilin* as *yǐn*, matching this text. All editions mistakenly write \"云,\" and Ren [Dachun] did not correct it.\n\nRegarding the chariots that followed: The right horse of the central pair was *Qúhuáng*, and the left was *Yúlún*; the left outer horse was *Dàolì*, and the right was *Shānzǐ*. Jiang Chaobo states: The *Erya* lists among horses *Xiǎolǐng Dàolì*; the *Guangya* writes it as *Táolì*; the *Yupian* as *Táolì*; and the *Records of the Grand Historian* (*Qin Annals*) as *Wēnlì*—all variant forms of *Dàolì*. The *Shiwen* notes: *Lì* is pronounced *lìyí* (力移切). *Dàolì* is the *Xiānlí* mentioned in the *Xunzi* (*Xiānlí* appears in the \"Xing E\" chapter).\n\nBoyi presided over the chariot. The *Shiwen* states: *Yāo* is pronounced *yúbiǎo* (于表切). Guo Pu comments: \"Boyi is a personal name.\" Canbai served as charioteer, and Benrong as the right attendant. Jiang Chaobo notes: According to the *Mu Tianzi Zhuan*, Benrong was a minister of the Gao clan who commanded the Seven Elite Warriors, though Zhang Zhan’s commentary does not elaborate.\n\nThey galloped a thousand *li* and arrived in the land of the Jusou clan. Wang Zhong states: *Jusou* is the *Qusou* mentioned in the *Tribute of Yu*. The *Shiwen* notes: *Jusou* is pronounced *Qusou*, the name of a Western Rong state. The Jusou clan presented the blood of a white swan for the king to drink. The *Shiwen* states: *Yǐn* is pronounced *yújìn* (于禁切). They offered the *dòng* of cattle and horses to wash the king’s feet.

      "translated_text": "The *Shiwen* states: *dòng* is pronounced *zhúyòng* (竹用切); *xǐ* (wash) is pronounced *xiānlǐ* (先礼切); *chéng* (chariot) is pronounced *shízhèng* (实证切).\n\nHaving drunk, they departed and lodged at the slopes of Kunlun, on the northern bank of the Red Water. The *Shan Hai Jing* states: \"Kunlun Mountain has waters of five colors.\" The *Shiwen* notes: *Kunlun* is pronounced *Kūnlún* (昆论). The *Shan Hai Jing* also says: \"By the shores of the Flowing Sands, beyond the Red Water and before the Black Water, stands a great mountain called Kunlun’s Mound. There are cave-dwellers, known as the Queen Mother of the West.\" Another day, they ascended Kunlun’s Mound—some versions omit the character *yú* (于). The *Shiwen* records *qiū* (丘) as *□*, noting: *□* is the ancient form of *qiū* (mound). They beheld the palace of the Yellow Emperor. The *Shiwen* cites the *Xin Yu* by Lu Jia: \"The Yellow Emperor toured the four seas, ascended Kunlun Mountain, built a palace, and gazed from its heights, sealing it to bequeath to later generations.\" The *Shiwen* states: *yí* (诒) is pronounced *yí* (怡), meaning \"to transmit.\"\n\nThereupon, they paid homage to the Queen Mother of the West. The *Shiwen* cites the *He Tu Yu Ban*: \"The Queen Mother of the West dwells on Kunlun Mountain.\" The *Bamboo Annals* records: \"In the seventeenth year of his reign, King Mu journeyed west, met the Queen Mother of the West, and was received as a guest in the Bright Palace.\" They feasted atop the Jasper Pool. The Queen Mother of the West was a human—tiger-toothed, disheveled-haired, wearing a *shèng* headdress, and skilled in whistling. This is recorded in the *Shan Hai Jing*.\n\nThe Queen Mother of the West sang a lay for the king—a *yáo* (徒歌, unaccompanied song). The poem was titled *White Clouds*. The *Shiwen* states: *wèi* (为) is pronounced *yú’é* (于讹切). The king responded—*hé* (和) meaning \"to answer.\" His poem was titled *Returning East*. The *Shiwen* states: *hé* (和) is pronounced *húwò* (胡卧切). Her words were mournful.\n\nThey observed the place where the sun sets in the west. The *Mu Tianzi Zhuan* states: \"They ascended Yan Mountain in the west.\" The character *xī* (西) was originally written as *nǎi* (乃). Wang Yinzhi notes: *Yān* (焉) here means \"in this place,\" \"then,\" or \"thus.\" The *Zhao Hun* says: \"The shaman Yang then descended to summon.\" The *Far Roaming* chapter reads: \"Then he wandered and lingered.\" The *Liezi*’s \"King Mu of Zhou\" chapter states: \"Thereupon, they observed where the sun sets.\" These all attest to the ancient usage of *yān nǎi* (焉乃) as a compound. Wang Chongmin argues: Wang’s interpretation is incorrect. The original text read *xī* (西), a scribal error. The character *yān* (焉) should still conclude the preceding clause. Zhang’s annotation cites the *Mu Tianzi Zhuan*: \"They ascended Yan Mountain in the west.\" According to Guo Pu’s commentary on the *Mu Tianzi Zhuan*: \"Yanzi Mountain is where the sun sets.\" Yan Mountain lies west of the Jasper Pool, marking the sun’s setting. Zhang’s citation clarifies the meaning of \"observing the west.\" The *Taiping Yulan* (vol. 3) quotes it as \"observed the place where the sun sets in the west,\" with only minor variations but retaining the character *xī* (西). The Ji edition correctly writes *xī* (西). Bo Jun notes: Wang Chongmin’s argument is sound. *Nǎi* (乃) was a graphic corruption of *xī* (西), and the text is now emended following the Ji edition. The *Shiwen* states: *yǎn* (弇) is pronounced *yǎn* (奄).\n\nJiang Chaobo observes: The block-printed editions of the *Mu Tianzi Zhuan* are fragmentary and incomplete; only Guo Pu’s commentary on the *Shan Hai Jing* preserves a more coherent version. His citation reads: \"On the auspicious day of *jiǎzǐ*, they paid homage to the Queen Mother of the West, presenting a black jade tablet and white jade disk as gifts. They offered a hundred strands of brocade and a hundred *jin* of gold and jade. The Queen Mother of the West bowed twice in acceptance. On *yǐchǒu*, the Son of Heaven feasted with the Queen Mother of the West atop the Jasper Pool. The Queen Mother of the West sang a lay for the Son of Heaven:\n\n*White clouds drift in the sky,*\n*The mountains and hills rise on their own.*\n*The Way stretches far and distant,*\n*Separated by rivers and mountains.*\n*May you not die, my lord,*\n*And come again.*\n\nThe Son of Heaven replied:\n\n*I return to the eastern lands,*\n*To harmonize and govern the Central States.*\n*When the myriad people are equitable and just,*\n*I shall turn to see you once more.*\n*Within three years,*\n*I shall return to your wilds.*\n\nThe Queen Mother of the West then chanted for the Son of Heaven:\n\n*Departing for those western lands,*\n*You dwell where you belong.*\n*Tigers and leopards gather in packs,*\n*Birds and magpies nest beside you.*\n*Your noble mandate does not waver,*\n*For I am the Emperor’s daughter.*\n*What manner of mortal are you,*\n*Who would now leave me?*\n*Playing the reed pipes and drums,*\n*My heart soars within.*\n*O child of this mortal world,*\n*You are Heaven’s hope.*\n\nThereupon, the Son of Heaven drove his chariot up Yan Mountain, where he inscribed his tracks upon its stones and planted a locust tree, naming it the Mountain of the Queen Mother of the West.\" They traveled ten thousand *li* in a single day. The *Shiwen* writes *wàn xíng* (万行), noting: *xíng* (行) is read as *lǐ* (里).\n\nThe king sighed and said: \"Alas! I alone am deficient in virtue yet harmonious in joy.

Sun Yirang notes: The exegesis’s *□化* should read *肢化* (*zhīhuà*), meaning \"corpse-transformation\" (a form of Daoist liberation).

      "translated_text": "Yin Wen bowed and led him into the chamber. Dismissing his attendants, he spoke to him, saying:\n\n\"When the Old Master Lao Dan departed for the West, he turned to me and said: 'The qi of living beings and the forms of corporeal things are all illusion. What the Creator begins and what yin and yang transform are called life and death. Those who exhaust the numbers and comprehend the changes, following form to shift and alter, are called transformation and illusion.'\n\n[Commentary] Those who master the numbers of the Two Modes and grasp the principles of yin and yang shape and move the myriad forms without perceiving the difficulty. The Creator’s craft is subtle, its work profound—inherently difficult to exhaust or bring to an end.\n\n[Commentary] Does the Creator have intent? It is naturally and seemingly subtle.\n\nWhen qi and substance press and thin, congealing into form, they follow transformation and depart, thus not immediately dissipating.\n\nTao Hongqing observes: Zhang’s commentary fails to grasp the meaning of *miao* (妙). The original character for *miao* should be *miao* (秒), also written as *miao* (妙). In the first chapter of the *Dao De Jing*, 'Constantly desireless, one observes its subtlety,' Wang Bi’s commentary states: '*Miao* is the utmost of the minute.' Its subtlety refers to its craft being so minute and wondrous as to be unknowable. This contrasts with the following phrase, 'Those who rely on form have craft that is manifest and work that is shallow.'\n\nBo Jun notes: The *Taiping Imperial Encyclopedia* (725) cites this as 'thus difficult to exhaust or bring to an end,' with *gu* (固) as *gu* (故), which better suits the meaning.\n\n[Commentary] *Fen* is pronounced *fèn* (房吻切).\n\nThose who rely on form have craft that is manifest and work that is shallow, thus arising and vanishing in an instant.\n\n[Commentary] Those who borrow things to enact change, or who follow form in its shifts, are but briefly born and briefly extinguished. Their work is evident, their deeds conspicuous, so all things are startled.\n\nOnly when one knows that illusion and transformation do not differ from life and death can one begin to study illusion.\n\n[Commentary] The meaning of this has already been detailed in the commentary on the chapter title.\n\nLu Wenchang notes: In the Zang edition, the commentary includes the character *jian* (见) after *zhu* (注).\n\nWang Chongmin states: *Yu* (与) here means *yi* (以), as explained in *Shi Ci*.\n\nThis means one may then begin to study illusion. The *Taiping Imperial Encyclopedia* (752) cites this as 'one may then begin to study illusion,' with different wording but the same meaning.\n\nYou and I are also illusion—why must you study?\"\n\n[Commentary] The body itself is illusion; to study illusion further is to have illusion study illusion.\n\n[Exegesis] The transformations of form and qi are ever-renewing and unceasing—how do they differ from illusion? Thus, what the spirit and qi transform endures long and is difficult to know, while what techniques and arts produce is near and easily seen. Yet one does not realize that what is difficult to know is the greater illusion, and what is easily seen is the lesser illusion. If one knows that illusion and transformation do not differ from life and death, why study further?\n\n[Commentary] *Fu* is pronounced *fù* (扶又切).\n\nLao Chengzi returned home and, applying Yin Wen’s words, meditated deeply for three months.\n\n[Commentary] *Shen* (深) is written as *yin* (淫), pronounced *shēn* (深).\n\nRen Dachun states: In the *Nine Hymns* of the *Chu Ci*, 'floating without root' is glossed as 'one version reads *chen* (沉), meaning deep and profound.' In the *Stratagems of Yan* from the *Warring States*, 'his wisdom is deep and his plans profound,' the commentary states: '*Chen* means deep.' In the *Records of the Grand Historian*, *Treatise on Music*: 'The sound is excessive and reaches the Shang.' Wang Su comments: 'The sound is deeply excessive and avaricious for Shang.' This confirms that *yin* (淫) is glossed as *shen* (深). Moreover, in this text, *yin* (淫) and *shen* (深) are often interchangeable. In the *Yellow Emperor* chapter, 'He will dwell in a measure that is not *shen* (深),' the commentary states: '*Shen* should be *yin* (淫).' *Yin* is read as *shen*, and *shen* is also read as *yin*—their meanings are interchangeable.\n\nThereafter, he could freely control life and death, manipulating the four seasons.\n\nWu Kaisheng notes: *Fan jiao* (□校) means to manipulate or play with.\n\n[Commentary] *Fan* is pronounced *fān* (翻). *Jiao* is pronounced *jiǎo* (绞). Gu Yewang reads it as *fan jiao* (翻交) of the four seasons.\n\nIn winter, he summoned thunder; in summer, he created ice. What flew ran, and what ran flew.\n\n[Commentary] If deep contemplation for a time can yield such mastery, how much more so for one who attains it without effort? Life must follow principle, and form must follow life. There has never been life without principle, nor form without life. Life and form, form and principle—though differing in refinement and coarseness—alternate as guest and host. They flow and shift in ceaseless succession, never pausing even briefly. Thus, they are ever-changing and never fixed, now gathering, now dispersing. When governed with order, their work is subtle and their deeds concealed; when cultivation loses measure, their traces become manifest and their transformations evident. Now, if the commands of the four seasons are disrupted, the three luminaries fall into disorder. Thunder and ice reverse their seasons, vessels and objects melt and scorch, so that flying things smelt clouds and sand to form billowing ice. When this occurs as usual, none doubt it. Extending this principle, if one exhausts the subtle numbers of yin and yang and fathoms the nature of the myriad things, one can shape and mold all beings, equaling the work of Creation. As for those who partially grasp techniques and draw upon qi and substance, bending and rising to emerge and submerge, glancing to exchange flight and running for altered forms—these are but the lesser arts.\n\n[Commentary] The phrase *bing hong* (冰澒) in all editions is mistakenly written as *shui qing* (水顷).\n\n[Commentary] *Shuo* is pronounced *shuò* (铄). *Hong* is pronounced *hóng* (洪).\n\nFor the rest of his life, he never revealed his arts.\n\n[Commentary] *Zhuo* (箸) is written as *zhuó* (着), pronounced *zhù* (陟虑切).\n\nThus, the world never transmitted them.\n\n[Commentary] That the Hundred Clans use it without knowing—this is the Way of the Sage.\"",

      "translated_text": "The manifestations of waking perception number eight—*Phonetic Gloss*: *jué* is pronounced *jiào*—while the signs of dreaming number six. *[Commentary]* *Zhēng* means verification; *hòu* means divination. The divination of the six dreams is explained in the *Rites of Zhou*. *Phonetic Gloss*: *xiàn* is pronounced *xián* (贤遍切).\n\nWhat are the eight manifestations? The first is *gù* *[Commentary]* *Gù* means affairs. The second is *wéi* *[Commentary]* *Wéi* means action. *Táo Hóngqìng notes*: *Gù* refers to abandoning the old, while *wéi* refers to pursuing the new, forming pairs with the following *dé* and *sàng*, *āi* and *lè*, *shēng* and *sǐ*. *Zhang’s commentary* is unclear. The third is *dé* (gain), the fourth is *sàng* (loss) *[Phonetic Gloss]* *sàng* is pronounced *sàng* (息浪切). The fifth is *āi* (sorrow), the sixth is *lè* (joy) *[Phonetic Gloss]* *lè* is pronounced *luò*. The seventh is *shēng* (life), the eighth is *sǐ* (death). These eight manifestations are what form engages. *Yú Yuè notes*: It should read, \"These eight are what form engages,\" to parallel the following \"These six are what spirit intersects.\" *Wáng Chóngmín states*: Yu’s suggestion is correct. The *Jífǔ* edition reads, \"These eight manifestations are what form engages.\" It appears an extra *zhēng* was mistakenly inserted, later moved beneath *zhě*, though the *Jífǔ* edition still preserves traces of this. *Wáng Shūmín notes*: The *Dàozàng* edition, citing *Fàn Zhìxū’s* commentary, reads, \"These eight are what form engages,\" matching Yu’s suggestion. The *Bàibiān* (65) cites it as \"These eight manifestations are what form engages,\" aligning with the *Jífǔ* edition. The *zhēng* is not a superfluous character; it likely originally read, \"These eight manifestations are what form engages,\" to parallel the following \"These six signs are what spirit intersects.\" In the current text, the *hòu* beneath *liù* has been omitted (as discussed later), rendering this passage garbled and unreadable. The *Emperor Huīzōng’s* commentary reads, \"Thus it is said, 'These eight verifications are what form engages'\" (using *zhèng* to gloss *zhēng*), indicating his edition was correct.\n\nWhat are the six signs? The first is *zhèngmèng* (ordinary dreams) *[Commentary]* Dreaming in ordinary circumstances. The second is *èmèng* (startling dreams) *[Commentary]* The *Rites of Zhou* commentary states: *È* should be *è* (startling), meaning dreams arising from fright. *[Phonetic Gloss]* *È* is pronounced *è*. The third is *sīmèng* (thought dreams) *[Commentary]* Dreams arising from contemplation. The fourth is *wùmèng* (waking dreams) *[Commentary]* Dreams occurring while awake and recounting them. *[Phonetic Gloss]* *Wù* is pronounced *wù*. The fifth is *xǐmèng* (joyful dreams) *[Commentary]* Dreams arising from happiness. The sixth is *jùmèng* (fearful dreams) *[Commentary]* Dreams arising from terror. These six are what spirit intersects. *[Commentary]* The main point of this chapter is to clarify that waking and dreaming are not distinct. *Wáng Shūmín notes*: The *Emperor Huīzōng’s* commentary reads, \"Thus it is said, 'These six signs are what spirit intersects.'\" His edition includes *hòu* beneath *liù*, paralleling the earlier \"These eight manifestations are what form engages.\" This should be restored. The *Cǎotáng Shījiān Bǔyí* (4) cites the text with *mèng* beneath *liù*, further proving the current edition omits characters. *Bó Jùn observes*: According to *Lú’s* commentary below—\"Yet waking has eight manifestations, dreaming six signs\"—and \"knowing the constant transformations of the eight manifestations and six signs,\" this supports *Wáng Shūmín’s* argument.\n\nThose who do not recognize the origins of sensory changes are perplexed by events when they arise, while those who recognize their origins understand them as they occur. Understanding their origins, one remains unalarmed. *[Commentary]* All transformations and actions arise from causes. Those who do not investigate their roots when events have yet to occur are inevitably confused. Truly recognizing their origins, even amid myriad strange occurrences, the mind remains unshaken. *[Exegesis]* By emptying the mind, quieting thoughts, reflecting inward, and preserving spirit, one can penetrate all sensory barriers and transform all living beings. Yet people only see the traces of such transformations, not the root of their efficacy. Why? Because the Dao operates in secrecy and is difficult to perceive, its achievements indistinguishable from human affairs. Thus, the Five Emperors and Three Kings are known only for their strength and wisdom, not for their accomplishments through transformation. Yet the eight manifestations of waking and six signs of dreaming encompass all human experiences. *Gù*, *wéi*, *dé*, *sàng*, *āi*, *lè*, *shēng*, and *sǐ* are what form engages; *zhèng*, *è*, *sī*, *wù*, *xǐ*, and *jù* are what spirit intersects. What form engages is deemed waking; what spirit intersects is deemed dreaming. Though waking and dreaming differ in expression, in transformation they are never distinct. Knowing the constant transformations of the eight manifestations and six signs is to recognize their origins. Understanding that preserving spirit without disturbance gives rise to transformation, what manifestations or signs could ever cause alarm? *[Phonetic Gloss]* *Dá* is pronounced *dá* (丁达切). *Jué* is pronounced *jué*.\n\nThe waxing and waning, ebb and flow of a single being all resonate with Heaven and Earth and respond to all things. *[Commentary]* Humans share qi with yin and yang and parallel Heaven and Earth in form; fortune and misfortune alternate, inevitably interconnected. Thus, when yin qi is strong, one dreams of wading through great waters in terror *[Commentary]* Losing harmony, one is overwhelmed and fearful. *[Phonetic Gloss]* *Rú* is pronounced *rú*. When yang qi is strong, one dreams of traversing great fires and being scorched—*the character is erroneous*. The *Lǐjì: Jiāotèshēng* *[Commentary]* Fire’s nature is fierce and violent; encountering it leads to scorching. *[Phonetic Gloss]* *Gài* is pronounced *yuè* (如悦切). *Jìngshùn’s* commentary in the *Phonetic Gloss* correctly uses *gài*, also pronounced *yuè*. This is not *Gù’s* original text but a later interpolation, which should be corrected accordingly—it is evident the error had not yet occurred in the Tang dynasty.",

      "translated_text": "In the southwestern corner of the farthest west lies a state. *[Pronunciation Note]* 隅 is written as 嵎 in the *Exegesis*. It notes: 嵎 and 隅 are interchangeable. Ren Dachun observes: The *Exegesis* of the *Erya*’s \"Shui\" chapter states: \"隅 is also written as 嵎隅, both pronounced *yúxū*.\" The *Shuowen* says: \"嵎 is the Fengyu Mountain, located in the state of Wangmang between Wu and Chu. It is composed of 山 and 禺 phonetic.\" Xu Kai notes: The *Guoyu* reads: \"The Lord of Fangfeng guarded the Fengyu Mountain.\" The present *Luyu* states: \"The lord of the Wangmang clan guarded the Fengyu Mountain.\" Wei Zhao comments: \"Feng is Mount Feng; Yu is Mount Yu.\" Thus, 嵎 and 隅 are interchangeable. Furthermore, the *Suoyin* to the *Records of the Grand Historian*’s \"Xia Benji\" states: \"The modern *Shangshu* and *Di Ming Yan* both write 禺铁.\" 禺 is the same as 嵎, so 嵎, 隅, and 禺 are all interchangeable.\n\nIts borders are unknown, and it is called the State of Ancient Wilderness. *[Pronunciation Note]* 莽 is pronounced *mǎng*. The qi of yin and yang do not intermingle, so cold and heat are indistinguishable. *[Variant]* 辨 is written as 辩 below. *[Pronunciation Note]* 亡 is pronounced *wú* below. The light of the sun and moon does not reach it, so day and night are indistinguishable. Its people neither eat nor wear clothing but sleep excessively. They awaken once every fifty days, believing what they do in dreams to be real and what they perceive while awake to be illusory.\n\nThe Central State, as the four seas call it—*[Annotation]* that is, the lands within the four seas. Tao Hongqing says: 齐 means \"central.\" 谓 is used interchangeably with 为. Bo Jun notes: The preceding text reads \"called the State of Ancient Wilderness,\" and the following text reads \"a state called the State of Flourishing Settlements,\" so 谓 here should share the same meaning as 名 and 曰 and should not be read as 为. Tao’s interpretation may be imprecise.\n\nIt spans north and south of the Yellow River—*[Pronunciation Note]* 跨 is pronounced *kuà*—and east and west of Mount Tai, extending over ten thousand *li*. Its yin and yang are measured precisely, so one cold and one heat alternate. Yu Yue says: The characters 审度 are transposed in transmission; the original reads \"阴阳之度审.\" The following sentence reads: \"其昏明之分察, 故一昼一夜.\" 度 pairs with 分, and 审 pairs with 察, making this clear. The division of darkness and light is distinct, so one day and one night alternate. *[Pronunciation Note]* 分 is pronounced *fèn*. Its people possess both wisdom and folly. The myriad things flourish, and skills and arts abound. There are rulers and subjects in hierarchy, and rituals and laws in mutual restraint. Their undertakings are beyond reckoning. They alternate between waking and sleeping, believing what they do while awake to be real and what they see in dreams to be illusory.\n\nIn the northeastern corner of the farthest east lies a state called the State of Flourishing Settlements. *[Pronunciation Note]* 阜 is pronounced *fù*. Its land is perpetually warm—*[Pronunciation Note]* 燠 is pronounced *yù*—and bathed in the lingering light of the sun and moon. Its soil does not yield fine crops. Its people eat grass roots and tree fruits, ignorant of cooked food. Their nature is fierce and violent, with the strong oppressing the weak—*[Pronunciation Note]* 藉 is pronounced *líng*. Bo Jun notes: 藉 should not be given the pronunciation *líng*. The *Exegesis* likely assumes 藉 corresponds to the 陵 in 陵轹 (as in the *Book of Later Han*’s *Zhu Fu Zhuan* commentary: \"陵轹 means to bully or despise\"), hence the *líng* pronunciation. Yet 藉 itself carries the meaning of oppression (as in the *Records of the Grand Historian*’s *Tian Ji Zhuan*: \"Now that I am alive, people all 藉 my brother,\" where the commentary glosses 藉 as \"to tread upon, to trample\").

Hence we know that the harmony of spiritual principle transcends distinctions of dreaming and waking, clothing and food. If one cannot forget desires, the emotions become bound to custom.\n\nTao Hongqing notes: \"In the southwest lies a land called the Ancient Wilderness,\" and so forth; \"in the northeast lies a land called the Land of Mound-Dwellers,\" and so forth.

The Qin edition reads 趣 as 趋. *[Pronunciation Note]* 趣 is pronounced *qū*, and so below. Ren Dachun observes: The *Records of the Grand Historian*’s *Zhang Yi Zhuan* states, \"He was about to harness his carriage and *qū* on his way,\" with the *Justice* glossing *qū* as *qù*. The *Sima Qian Zhuan* reads, \"*Qū*-shě take different paths,\" where *qū-shě* means *qū-shě*. The *Book of Han*’s *Jia Yi Zhuan* states, \"*Qū* into the hall to perform *Xià*.\" Here, *qū* is *qū*. Thus, Jing Shun’s *Pronunciation Note* reads *qū* as *qū*. Bo Jun notes: The character 趨 (qū) in common usage (see *Guangyun* under 十虞, and *Longkan Shoujian*) shares the same form as the 趨 (chí) in *Shuowen*’s \"趨趙\" but differs in sound and meaning.\n\nAn elderly laborer’s strength was utterly spent, *[Bo Jun’s Note]* The *Guanzi*’s *Qingzhong Ji* states: \"Those dwelling in villages are called *xiàchén*; those in towns, *xiàtōng*—these are *yìfū*.\" *Yìfū* is a term for the lowly, hence its use as an insult. The *Zuo Zhuan* of Duke Wen’s first year records: \"Jiang Qian grew angry and said, 'Bah! *Yìfū*! It is fitting that the king wished to kill you and install Zhi!'\" Yet he was made to toil even harder. By day, he groaned and moaned as he worked. *[Pronunciation Note]* 呻呼 is pronounced *shēn yín*, and so below. *[Bo Jun’s Note]* 呼 should not be given the pronunciation *yín*; the text may be corrupt or missing characters. Otherwise, it is likely that Jing Shun glossed 呼 as 吟, hence the annotation, unaware of its phonetic inaccuracy. By night, he sank into exhausted slumber. His spirit scattered and waned, and night after night, he dreamed he was a ruler. *[Qin Enfu’s Note]* 昔 and 夕 are phonetically close. *[Bo Jun’s Note]* The *Book of Songs* states, \"Enjoying wine *jīn-xī*,\" where *jīn-xī* means *jīn-xī* (this evening). The *Guliang Zhuan* reads, \"From sunset to starlight is called *xī*,\" where *xī* is 夕. The *Guanzi* states, \"*Dàn-xī* at work,\" where *dàn-xī* is *dàn-xī* (day and night). These all attest to the interchangeability of 昔 and 夕. *[Pronunciation Note]* 昔昔 means nightly. Enthroned above his people, he governed the affairs of the state. He roamed and feasted in palaces, indulging every desire, his joy unmatched. *[Pronunciation Note]* 燕 is pronounced *yàn*; 觀 is read *guàn*. *[Pronunciation Note]* 樂 is pronounced *lè*.

Thus, the laborer toils by day and finds rest by night, while the House of Yin enjoys honor by day and humiliation by night.

The spirit is the master of life, yet men do not know to nurture the spirit to calm the body. The body is the vessel of the spirit, yet men do not know to sustain the body to ease the spirit.

      "translated_text": "Shortly after, he forgot where he had concealed it and thus took it for a dream. As he traveled along the road, he recounted the tale in song. A passerby overheard him, followed his words, and retrieved the deer.

Following the Qin engraving of the Lu Chongxuan edition and the *Sijie* edition, the character *zhe* (者) is deleted.\n\nHis wife replied, “Are you the one who dreamed of the woodcutter obtaining the deer? How could there be a woodcutter? Now that the deer is truly in your possession, is your dream the real one?”\n\nThe man said, “I have the deer—why trouble myself over whether his was a dream or mine?”\n\nThe woodcutter returned home, unwilling to accept the loss of the deer. *[Editor’s Note]* *Yan* (厌) is interchangeable with *qie* (愜). The *Shuowen* defines it as “contentment.” The *Book of Songs*’ “Xiao Rong” reads: *Yan yan liang ren* (厌厌良人), with the *Commentary* explaining *yan yan* as “tranquil.” Thus, *bu yan shi lu* (不厌失鹿) means “unwilling to resign himself to losing the deer.” *[Pronunciation Note]* *Yan* is pronounced *qiè*, or alternatively *yàn*.\n\nThat night, he truly dreamed of where he had hidden it and of the one who had taken it. At dawn, he followed his dream’s guidance and found the place. He then brought the matter to court to dispute ownership, and the case was referred to the *shishi*. *[Pronunciation Note]* *Shishi* refers to the official in charge of the five prohibitions.\n\nThe *shishi* said, “At first, you truly obtained the deer but falsely called it a dream; now, you truly dreamed of obtaining it but falsely call it real. He truly took your deer, and you dispute it with him.” Tao Hongqing said: The phrase *er yu ruo zheng lu* (而与若争鹿) should read *er ruo yu zheng lu* (而若与争鹿). Here, *zheng lu* (争鹿) refers to the one who lost the deer; below, *ju you ci lu* (据有此鹿) refers to the one who took it. Thus, I propose dividing it in two.\n\nThe wife also claimed that the deer belonged to the one who dreamed of it. *[Textual Note]* The *Jifu* and *Shidetang* editions write *ren* (认) instead of *ren* (仞). *[Pronunciation Note]* *Ren* is also written as *ren*.\n\n“No one truly obtained the deer.

The judicial officer asked, “Will you once more divide a man’s deer based on a dream?” The *Shiwen* notes: *Fu* (复) is pronounced *fuyou*.\n\nHe consulted the state minister. The *Shiwen* notes: *Xiang* (相) is pronounced *xiliang*. The minister replied, “Whether one dreamed or not, your servant cannot discern. To distinguish waking from dreaming, only the Yellow Emperor and Confucius could do so.”\n\n[Annotation] How do sages discern waking from dreaming? Simply by knowing they are not different.\n\nThe *Shiwen* notes: *Xie* (邪) is pronounced *sizhe*. *Zhi* (直) may also be written as *zhen* (真).\n\n“Now that the Yellow Emperor and Confucius are gone,”—the *Shiwen* notes: *Wang* (亡) is pronounced *wu*—“who can discern it? Yu Zhengxie said: The *Shiji Zhengyi* quotes the *Diwang Shiji*, which states: ‘The Yellow Emperor dreamed of a great wind that blew away all the dust and grime of the world. He also dreamed of a man wielding a thousand-jun crossbow herding ten thousand sheep. Upon waking, the Emperor sighed and said: The wind is the herald of commands, the one who governs; the dust is removed, and earth remains—would there not be one surnamed Feng and named Hou? The thousand-jun crossbow is the instrument of extraordinary strength; herding ten thousand sheep is the work of one who can guide the people toward goodness—would there not be one surnamed Li and named Mu? Thereupon, he sought them according to these omens: he found Feng Hou at the edge of the sea and appointed him minister; he found Li Mu in the great marsh and made him general. The Yellow Emperor then compiled the *Omen Dream Classic* in eleven scrolls.’ His method of interpreting dreams followed the natural course of events and achieved success—truly, it was like *Xiangwang* obtaining the pearl. The *Lingshu* contains the *Yin Xie Fa Meng* chapter. The *Omen Dream Classic* is listed in the *Yiwen Zhi*. It is said: *The Yellow Emperor’s Long Willow Dream Interpretation*. Confucius’s dream between the pillars is recorded in the *Tan Gong*. To speak of discerning dreams by invoking the Yellow Emperor and Confucius—this is the meaning. Moreover, the judicial officer’s words may be trusted.”\n\n[Annotation] *Xun* (恂) means “trust,” pronounced *xun*. If one is deluded by joy and anger, one still cannot distinguish the reality of waking and dreaming—how much less when there is no waking or dreaming at all?\n\n[Exegesis] As for those who take it as a dream, it is merely deluded perception. When the spirit’s perception is unclear, it becomes a false dream. The one who overheard and took the deer was also unclear—this, too, was a dream. The one who obtained the deer then dreamed of seeking the deer and brought the case before the judicial officer. All were unclear. Their deluded sentiments were the same, hence the division in two. Only the sage could fully comprehend this delusion! But in an age without sages, matters lack certainty, so the judicial officer, unable to resolve what was unresolved, only added further delusion.\n\nWu Kaisheng said: *Xun* (恂) should be *xun* (徇). Bo Jun’s note: The *Shuowen* states: *Xun* (恂) means “sincere of heart.” The *Zuozhuan* for the eleventh year of Duke Wen reads: “The people of the state did not *xun*,” and Du’s commentary says: *Xun* (徇) means “to comply.” The *Shiwen* notes: *Xun* is pronounced *xun*, meaning “trust.”\n\nIn his middle years, Hua Zi of Yangli in Song suffered from forgetfulness. The *Shiwen* notes: *Hua* (华) is pronounced *huahua*. *Wang* (忘) is pronounced *wang*, meaning he could not remember things. What he took in the morning, he forgot by evening; what he gave in the evening, he forgot by morning.",

      "translated_text": "Lu Bujun notes: *Cóng* (从) should be read in its standard sense, meaning \"to comply with.\" The *Shiwen* is in error. No one knew what methods he employed—[Annotation:] The Confucian scholar’s many techniques were not confined to a single path of verification. Yet the illness of many years vanished in a single morning. [Annotation:] The preceding passage states that where shamans and physicians had exhausted their arts in vain, the Confucian scholar alone could cure what ailed him. First, it cites Huazi’s forgetting as akin to spontaneity, demonstrating the ultimate state of non-contrivance, which cannot be restored through mere techniques. The Confucian scholar’s achievement surpassed that of shamans and physicians, proving that when principle is not obscure, one may employ diverse methods to guide the afflicted. It further sought to awaken the forgetful one to the realization that his former oblivion nearly approached the supreme principle. [Exegesis:] Laozi said: \"In the pursuit of learning, one daily accumulates; in the pursuit of the Dao, one daily diminishes. Diminish and again diminish, until one reaches non-action.\" Huazi studied the Dao and forgot his own existence, while the Confucian scholar studied the manifest to augment his knowledge. One who augments knowledge must distinguish right and wrong before his eyes; one who forgets existence remains unmoved by gain or loss in the celestial storehouse. How could divination or medicine ever cure such a condition? Thus, the Confucian scholar used manifold methods to entice his mind, and right and wrong confounded his thoughts. Huazi thereby lost the Dao and afterward virtue; having lost virtue, right and wrong raced through his breast, and so the art of \"sitting in forgetfulness\" was lost. [Annotation:] Below *yǒu guò* (有过), the Zang edition includes the particle *hū* (乎). Wang Lai states: In the exegesis, the second *zhī* (之) in *sǔn zhī yòu sǔn zhī* (损之又损之) is superfluous. Lu Bujun notes: According to Fan Yingyuan’s *Collected Commentaries on the Daodejing*, Peng Zun’s *Collected Commentaries on the Daodejing*, and the ancient editions, both *zhī* characters are present, matching the citation in *Chongxuan*. Thus, the second *zhī* is not superfluous, and Wang’s claim is mistaken. The *Shiwen* records: *Sī* is pronounced *sì*.\n\nHazi, now awakened, flew into a great rage, cast out his wife, punished his son, and seized a halberd to chase away the Confucian scholar. Lu Bujun notes: The *Zuozhuan* for the twenty-third year of Duke Xi records: \"Jiang said, ‘Go! Clinging to comfort will surely ruin your reputation.’ The prince refused. Jiang plotted with Zifan, got him drunk, and sent him away. When he awoke, he took up a halberd to pursue Zifan.\" The ancients regarded the halberd as a personal weapon, hence its frequent mention in ancient texts as *cāo gē* (操戈). The *Shiwen* records: *Cāo* is pronounced *qī dāo*. The people of Song seized him and demanded an explanation.",

The character *jì* in the *Zang* edition is written as *jì* (\"record\"), both being interchangeable. The *Shiwen* writes *miào dàng* as *miào shǎng*, noting: *dàng* is pronounced *dīng làng*, with one version reading *shǎng*.\n\nAmong the people of Qin, there was a man of the Feng clan who had a son. The *Shiwen* notes: *Féng* is pronounced *páng*. In his youth, he was perceptive. Lu Bujun notes: The *Taiping Yulan* (49) writes *huì* (\"perceptive\") as *huì* (\"wise\"). The *Book of Later Han*, in the biography of Kong Rong, states: \"Will he not soon be wise?\" The commentary notes that *huì* is interchangeable with *huì* (\"wise\"). The *Shiwen* notes: *shào* is pronounced *shī zhào*. But upon reaching adulthood, he developed an illness of delusion and confusion. {Note} Perceptiveness is not delusion, yet the flaw of relying on it must lead to delusion. The *Shiwen* notes: *wǎng* is pronounced *wén liǎng*.\n\nHe mistook singing for weeping, saw white as black, smelled fragrance as rotten, {Note} The *Monthly Ordinances* states: \"Its odor is rotten.\" Qian Daxin said: The ancients paired fragrance with rottenness, taking their opposition, just as flavors have sweet and bitter. The *Monthly Ordinances* states: \"Spring’s odor is rank, summer’s is scorched, the center’s is fragrant, autumn’s is fishy, and winter’s is rotten.\" He tasted sweetness as bitterness. The *Shide Tang* edition writes *cháng* (\"often\") as *cháng* (\"taste\"). Yu Yue said: *Cháng* and *cháng* were interchangeable in antiquity. The *Liji*, in the \"Shaoyi\" chapter, states: \"Horses are not *cháng* fed,\" and the *Shiwen* notes: \"*Cháng* is written as *cháng* in one version.\" The *Erya*, in the \"Shigu\" section, states: \"*Cháng* means sacrifice,\" and the *Shiwen* notes: \"The character *cháng* is also written as *cháng*,\" both serving as evidence. The original text of the *Liezi* borrowed *cháng* for *cháng*. The *Daozang* edition replaced it with the original character, but this deviates from the ancient text’s usage. His actions were not what he deemed correct: wherever his intentions turned—heaven and earth, the four directions, water and fire, cold and heat—nothing was not inverted.\n\n{Explanation} Those who pride themselves on petty wisdom are deemed perceptive by others; those who embody the Dao and preserve harmony are deemed foolish. One who equalizes sound and color, forgets water and fire, is beyond the discernment of common people, hence they regard the Dao as delusion and confusion.\n\nYangshi told his father, \"The gentlemen of Lu possess many arts and skills. Might they be able to cure him? Why not seek their help?\" His father went to Lu, passing through Chen. The *Shiwen* notes: *guò* is pronounced *gē*. There, he encountered Lao Dan and recounted his son’s condition. Lao Dan said, \"How do you know your son is deluded? Now, all the people in the world are confused about right and wrong, blinded by profit and harm. Those sharing the same affliction are many, so none awaken. Moreover, the delusion of one person is not enough to overturn a household; the delusion of one household is not enough to overturn a village; the delusion of one village is not enough to overturn a state; the delusion of one state is not enough to overturn the world. If the entire world is deluded, who could overturn it? Wang Chongmin said: The character *qīng* (\"overturn\") does not correspond with the preceding text, likely an error for *zhèng* (\"correct\"). Lao Dan’s words to the Feng clan meant that his son’s delusion was not an illness—today, all the world’s people are confused about right and wrong, blinded by profit and harm, which is the true illness. Only because those sharing the illness are many do they fail to recognize it as such. If the entire world were as deluded as your son, who would seek to correct it? This follows the preceding *qīng* (\"overturn\") in error. The subsequent text—\"Who could correct sorrow and joy, sound and color, odor and taste, right and wrong?\"—directly continues this idea. If written as *qīng* (\"overturn\"), it would not convey the meaning. The *Taiping Yulan* (490) correctly writes it as *zhèng* (\"correct\"), providing evidence.\n\nHad all the people in the world been of the same mind as your son—The *Shiwen* writes *xiàng* as *xiāng*, noting: *xiāng* is pronounced *xiàng*—you would be the one truly deluded. Who could correct sorrow and joy, sound and color, odor and taste, right and wrong? The *Shiwen* notes: *lè* is pronounced *luò*. Moreover, my words here are not necessarily free from delusion, let alone the gentlemen of Lu, those couriers of delusion. {Note} The gentlemen of Lu extolled benevolence and righteousness, clarifying right and wrong, hence they are called couriers of delusion. The *Shide Tang* edition omits the character *cǐ* (\"this\") before *yán* (\"words\"), while the *Taiping Yulan* (490) includes it. Wang Zhong said: *yóu* (\"courier\") and *yóu* (\"fault\") are interchangeable. Wang Chongmin said: The *Taiping Yulan* (490) writes *yóu* as *yóu*, likely altered by the compiler. Lu Bujun notes: *Yóu* and *yóu* were interchangeable in ancient script, as seen in Gu Yanwu’s *Rizhi Lu*, volume 27, under the *Erya* commentary entry.",

The *Shiwen* notes: *yān* is pronounced *yúqián*. \"Cherishing your provisions is not as good as hastening home.\"\n\n{Note} *Róng* means to discard. This chapter clarifies that the principles of right and wrong cannot be entirely settled, for they are all formed by the majority overwhelming the few to create contention.\n\n{Exegesis} *Róng* means to discard. The world is full of vulgar scholars, while those who awaken to the Dao are few. The deluded many mock the solitary wise, reversing truth to call them deluded. Thus Laozi said: \"When inferior scholars hear the Dao, they laugh heartily at it. If they did not laugh, it would not be the Dao.\" Now, to expect the contentious scholars of Zhao to rectify right and wrong is to stray ever further from the Dao. The Confucians of Lu, so deeply lost in the Way of forgetting form and preserving spirit, are themselves the most deluded—how could they enlighten others’ delusions? You would do better to abandon your roadside provisions and return swiftly.\n\nQin Enfu said: The character *zhào* (\"Zhao\") in the exegesis is likely a miswriting of *qū* (\"to hasten\"). Mou Ting said: Xunzi’s *Discourse on Military Affairs* states, \"Carry three days’ provisions,\" with the annotation: \"*Yíng* means to bear a load.\" Zhuangzi’s *Opening the Trunk* says, \"*Yíngténg* and hasten,\" with the *Shiwen* gloss: \"*Yíng* means to wrap.\" The *Fangyan* states: \"*Yíng* means to carry on the shoulder.\" Thus *yíngténg* means to bind and carry. Liezi’s *róng* is a loan for *yíng*. Yu Yue said: Zhang Zhan and Lu Chongxuan both gloss *róng* as \"to discard,\" but their basis is unknown—this is likely incorrect. *Róng* stands in contrast to *shí* (\"substance\"); *róng* is like *huá* (\"flower\"). The *Erya*’s *Explanation of Plants* states: \"Trees are called *huá*, grasses are called *róng*. Those that bear fruit without flowering are called *xiù*; those that flower without bearing fruit are called *yīng*.\" Such is its meaning. In ancient diction, all that lacks substance is called *huá* (\"flowery\"). The *Book of Later Han*, in the commentary to the *Biography of Ma Rong*, states: \"*Huáyù* means empty reputation.\" If *huá* can mean \"empty,\" then *róng* may also mean \"empty.\" \"*Róng* your provisions\" means they are wasted, without practical use. The *Book of Han*, in the *Biography of Yang Xiong*, states: \"The Four Elders gathered *róng* on South Mountain.\" Yan Shigu commented: \"*Róng* means reputation.\" Since *róng* contrasts with *shí* (\"substance\"), it may also mean \"name.\" In the context of plants, *róng* and *shí* are paired; in human affairs, *míng* (\"name\") and *shí* (\"substance\") or *xū* (\"empty\") and *shí* (\"substance\") are paired. Its meaning is thus coherent. Wu Kaisheng said: *Róng* should be the same as *yíng*; *qì* (\"discard\") should be *qì* (variant form).

One born in Yan never leaves his roots; one raised in Chu grows accustomed to his surroundings. Returning to one’s origin yet failing to recognize it, the shallow-minded are easily deceived. If one is led by semblances and lured, the credulous will be misled. When they realize the truth is not as they believed, they forget their emotions and feel only shame. Even when they see the real, they still regard it as false—neither right nor wrong is clear to them, for they are confused by others’ influence.\n\nHow much more so with today’s gentlemen, who all falsely cling to the city and altars of Jin—how could they know the supreme Dao of nurturing the spirit and returning to the root?\n\n*Geng* (\"grew\") is written as *bian* (\"then\") in the Shide Hall edition.

      "translated_text": "Here is the translation:\n\n---\n\nThe note states: \"Words of the past arose in response to circumstances; what is now made clear exhausts their ultimate meaning. You merely know that delighting in Heaven and knowing fate brings no sorrow, yet you do not know the great sorrow in delighting in Heaven and knowing fate.\"\n\nThe note explains: \"To know nothing, to delight in nothing, to sorrow in nothing—this is called greatness.\"\n\nWang Chongmin observes: The *Taiping Yulan* (468) includes a *zhi* (之) before *you* (有).\n\nNow I tell you the truth: cultivate the self, accept poverty and success, recognize that going and coming are not of the self, and banish disorder from the mind’s reckonings. (The original text reads *zhi* (止, \"to stop\"), but the present version follows the *Zangben*, *Shidetang*, and *Qin* editions, emending it to *wang* (亡, \"to banish\"). The *Shiwen* notes: *wang* is pronounced *wang* (忘, \"to forget\"), and one edition reads *zhi* (止).) This is what you call delighting in Heaven and knowing fate without sorrow.\n\nThe note explains: \"This merely distinguishes the boundaries of inner and outer, discerns the realms of honor and disgrace—no more. How could it be a matter of being without preference or aversion?\"\n\nThe exposition states: \"To delight in Heaven and know fate without sorrow is the way of timely success, not the means to respond, act, and save the world.\"\n\nConfucius said: \"I once held these words, but now they differ from the past. Formerly, I cultivated the *Book of Songs* and *Book of Documents*, rectified rites and music—\" (The *Shiwen* notes: *nang* (曩) is pronounced *nang* (乃朗切). *Yue* (乐) is pronounced *yue* (岳), and the same applies below.) \"—intending to govern the world and leave a legacy for future generations.\"\n\nThe note explains: \"The *Book of Songs*, *Book of Documents*, rites, and music are instruments for governing the age. The sage employs them to remedy the ills of the time; if their use strays from the Dao, they are of no benefit to order.\"\n\nThe *Shiwen* notes: *yi* (遗) is pronounced *yi* (唯季切).\n\n\"It was not merely to cultivate the self and govern the state of Lu. The note explains: \"The sage’s wisdom encompasses all things, and his Dao saves the world. To secure the self and save a single state is no way to be a sage.\"\n\nYet the rulers and ministers of Lu daily lost their proper order, benevolence and righteousness further declined, and human nature grew ever more shallow. If this Dao could not prevail in a single state or in its own time, what of the world and future generations?\n\nThe note explains: \"The arts of governing the age truly require benevolence and righteousness. Once the age is ordered, the arts used to order it should be set aside. If, when all affairs are concluded, one clings to them without letting go, those who are moved by them will be few, while those who profit from them will be many. The beginning of decline and shallowness truly lies here. To observe the world through a single state, or future generations through the present—how different are the harms they bring? Only one who is perfectly adaptable and unobstructed can follow change as it suits, without clinging to one side.\"\n\nZhongfu said: \"What of the world and future generations?\" *Ru* (如, \"what of\") here means *ruhe* (如何, \"how\"). The omission of *he* (何) is particularly rare.\n\nBo Jun notes: Yu Shengwu’s *New Evidence on the Book of Changes* holds that *yi* (矣) here is the same as *yi* (以) in the *Book of Songs* (*Zhaonan*, \"Gathering White Milfoil\"): \"Where shall we gather white milfoil?\"\n\nThe *Shiwen* notes: *zhi* (治) is pronounced *zhi* (直吏切), and the same applies to *zhi luan* (治乱, \"order and disorder\"). *She* (舍) is pronounced *she* (舍). *He* (阂) is pronounced *ai* (碍).\n\n\"I first realized that the *Book of Songs*, *Book of Documents*, rites, and music could not save order and disorder, yet I did not know the way to reform them. This is the sorrow of those who delight in Heaven and know fate.\"\n\nThe note explains: \"Only by discarding the misuse of rites and music, not the use of rites and music themselves—for rites and music cannot be discarded—does one not know the way to reform them. Citing this as a sorrow lays the groundwork for the meaning below, hence these words come first.\"\n\nThe exposition states: \"It is not that the *Book of Songs*, *Book of Documents*, rites, and music are insufficient as methods for governing the world; rather, the theories of the age cannot be saved by the *Book of Songs*, *Book of Documents*, rites, and music. Yet to discard these methods would leave nothing as the foundation of rites. This is the profound sorrow of those with the Dao.\"\n\nBo Jun notes: The *Taiping Yulan* (468) includes a *ye* (也) after \"This is the sorrow of those who delight in Heaven and know fate.\"\n\nThe *Shiwen* notes: *wei* (为) is pronounced *wei* (于伪切).\n\n\"Nevertheless, I have attained it. What is called delight and knowledge is not what the ancients meant by delight and knowledge.\"\n\nThe note explains: \"Zhuangzi said: 'To delight in poverty and success, things and the self—this is not the sage.' Thus, the ancients did not take the absence of delight as delight, nor the absence of knowledge as knowledge. To follow what one delights in is to naturally have no delight in principle; to follow what one knows is to naturally have no knowledge in principle.\" The characters *suo wei* (所谓, \"what is called\") are inverted as *wei suo* (谓所) in all editions; the present version follows the *Jifu* edition in correcting them.\n\nBo Jun further notes: The *Zhuangzi* (*Da Zongshi* chapter) states: \"Thus, when the sage employs troops, he may lose a state but not the people’s hearts; his beneficence extends to ten thousand generations, yet he does not do so out of love for people. Therefore, to delight in things and the self is not the sage.\" The note’s citation of \"delighting in poverty and success\" includes a *qiong* (穷, \"poverty\"), which is likely an interpolation.\n\n\"To have no delight and no knowledge—this is true delight and true knowledge.\"\n\nThe note explains: \"To be without any delight or any knowledge is to be able to delight in the world’s delights and know the world’s knowledge while remaining without intention.\"\n\nThus, there is nothing in which one does not delight, nothing one does not know, nothing one does not sorrow for, and nothing one does not do.\n\nThe note explains: \"Abiding in the fundamental and embodying completeness, one can act without acting and yet do all things.\"\n\n\"What is there to discard in the *Book of Songs*, *Book of Documents*, rites, and music? Why reform them?\"\n\nThe note explains: \"If one wishes to cast aside the *Book of Songs* and *Book of Documents* and change the methods of governance, how is this the way to remedy ills? To employ them without clinging, to act without reliance—things will be preserved of themselves.\"\n\nThe exposition states: \"To know what Heaven’s fate renders unavoidable and to accept one’s lot without sorrow—this is the constant heart of the noble person. But those of old who opened things and accomplished affairs, who aided people and benefited customs, were not so. They did not rest in their delight or entrust themselves to their knowledge. They preceded Heaven without opposing it, and followed Heaven while honoring its timing—this is true delight and true knowledge. Being thus, there is nothing they do not delight in, nothing they do not know, and thus they can do all things.\"",
      "overlap_context": "qiu*, *po*, *cu*—all mean near.\" Since *jia* shares the same gloss as *po* (\"urgent\") and *cu* (\"pressed\"), *jia* thus means \"narrow.\" The *Hou Hanshu*’s \"Juli\" chapter states: \"It is narrow from east to west and long from north to south.\" Li Xian’s note reads: \"*Jia* is pronounced *xia*,\" thus *yi jia* (\"understanding narrow\") means *yi xia* (\"understanding constricted\"). The *Shiwen* preserves the ancient character. This was merely my past teaching. Let me now correct it with my present words.",

      "translated_text": "\"Could one ever rely on such strategies? Thus, the *Songs* and *Book of Documents*, rites and music, are indeed the foundation for assisting transformation—why would one seek to change them?\n\nThe *Shiwen* notes: *Juan* is read as *yuan*. Yan Hui faced north, bowed with hands clasped, and said, 'I too have attained it.' The annotation states: This is what is meant by 'not opposing yet seeming foolish.'\n\nBo Jun notes: 'Bowed with hands clasped' is grammatically unsound. *Bai* should be written as □. □ is also written as □, and in the *Baihan Jian* as □. The characters for □ and *bai* are similar in form and thus mistaken. The *Shuowen* states: '□ means to raise the hands; a variant is □. Yang Xiong says *gong* is formed from two hands.' This is the modern character *gong*. The *Fei Gou* chapter of the *Xunzi* reads: 'The noble person examines the Way of the later kings and discusses it before the hundred kings of old, as if bowing in respect and deliberating.' Wang Niansun emends this, stating: '*Bai* is a corruption of *zhi*.' This serves as evidence.\n\nHe went out and told Zigong. Zigong was bewildered and lost, for he had not yet fully aligned with the ultimate words, and thus fell into confusion. Returning home, he indulged in thought for seven days without sleep or food, until his bones stood stark. The annotation states: He exerted himself in contemplation of the Dao, forgetting sleep and sustenance.\n\nYan Hui went again to enlighten him, whereupon Zigong returned to Master Qiu’s gate, playing the zither and reciting the texts, never ceasing for the rest of his life. The annotation states: Having awakened to the ultimate principle, he forgot all else.\n\nThe exposition states: Yan Hui, second only to the sage in the Dao, attained it without opposing what he heard. Zigong relied on the *Songs* and *Documents* for his wisdom, and thus, when words were spoken, he lost sight of their source. After Yan Hui enlightened him again, he awakened to the benefits of learning and the Dao of daily diminution.\n\nThe annotation's 'forgot' was written as 'perished' in the Northern Song edition; Wang’s edition followed this, but the present text follows the *Zang* edition and *Shi De Tang* edition in emending it.\n\nA minister of Chen paid a visit to Lu. The *Shiwen* notes: *Pin* is read as *pì zhèng*. He had a private audience with the house of Shusun. The *Shi De Tang* edition omits the character 'house' before 'said.' Shusun said, 'There is a sage in our state.' The minister asked, 'Is it not Kong Qiu?' 'It is,' he replied. 'How do you know he is a sage?' The annotation states: Profound is this question! The Dao of the sage transcends the bounds of common understanding, beyond the reach of all things; one sees only the traces of its convergence and calls him a sage. How could one truly know what makes him a sage?\n\nShusun said, 'I have often heard of him from Yan Hui.' The annotation states: Profound is this answer! Unless one embodies both aspects and manifests both forms, how could one speak of even a semblance or glimpse of what comes before and after? Even with Yan Hui’s capacity, he could not adequately describe it—how much less could those beneath him?\n\nThe *Shiwen* notes: *Fo* is read as *fāng wèi*; *liang* is read as *liàng*; *cheng* is read as *chǐ zhèng* below, the same.\n\nHe said, 'Kong Qiu can set aside the mind and employ the form.' The annotation states: These are Yan Hui’s words. The sage neither sets aside nor employs anything. The terms 'setting aside' and 'employing' arise only in response to circumstances. Thus, in attending to the myriad affairs, engaging with worldly matters—these are all matters of form and trace. As for the profound and absolute, the still and silent—these remain serene and unmoving.\n\nThe exposition states: The sage responds to things as they arise, aiding the times and serving their use, guiding the multitude of beings by manifesting traces, yet does not display the true to transform the common.\n\nThe *Shiwen* notes: *Bo* is read as *pò* below, the same.\n\nThe minister of Chen said, 'There is also a sage in our state—did you not know?' 'Who is this sage?' he asked. 'Among the disciples of Lao Dan, there is one named Kang Cangzi.' The annotation states: *Kang* is read as *gū láng*, also as *gēng*. The *Shiwen* notes: *Kang Cang* is read as *Gēng Sāng*; his name was Chu, and the *Records of the Historian* writes it as *Kang Cangzi*. Jia Kui’s *Xing Shi Ying Lan* states: In Wu Commandery, there is a family named Gengsang, regarded as a scholarly clan. Duan Yucai says: Jia Kui’s *Xing Shi Ying Lan* must be the *Xing Shi Ying Xian Pu* mentioned in the *Suishu Jing Ji Zhi*.\n\nThe annotation states: Even Lao Dan did not speak of attaining the Dao himself—how could Kang Cang have attained it? This is merely a borrowed name to illustrate that the ultimate principle is never severed from the principles of things.\n\n'He has attained Lao Dan’s Dao and can see with his ears and hear with his eyes.' The annotation states: The physical form is the dwelling of the mind and intelligence; the ears and eyes are the doors and windows of seeing and hearing. If the spirit is thoroughly permeating, then seeing and hearing do not depend on doors and windows, and illumination is not obstructed by walls.\n\nJiang Chaobo says: The *Miscellaneous Chapters* of the *Zhuangzi* reads: 'Among the followers of Lao Dan, there was one named Gengsang Chu, who had partially attained Lao Dan’s Dao and dwelt in the northern mountains of Weidie.'\n\nThe Lord of Lu heard this and was greatly astonished. The annotation states: He was not surprised by Confucius’s employment of form but by the interchangeability of ears and eyes. Since his traces were the same as those of other things, nothing startled him.\n\nHe sent a high minister with rich gifts to invite him. Wang Chongmin says: The *Yi Lin* quotes it as 'sent with the礼 of a high minister'; the *Quan Dao* chapter of the *Kang Cangzi* reads: 'Sent Shusun to return the visit and invite Kang Cangzi, treating him with the礼 of a high minister.' This aligns with the meaning of the *Yi Lin* quotation.\n\nBo Jun notes: The present two-volume *Kang Cangzi* was forged by Wang Shiyuan, a recluse of Xiangyang during the late Kaiyuan era of the Tang, as seen in the preface to the *Meng Haoran Ji* and the *Da Tang Xin Yu*.\n\nKang Cangzi accepted the invitation and arrived.\"",

      "translated_text": "The annotation notes: One who is utterly without intent perceives no distinction between east and west as external to the self. The Duke of Lu humbly entreated him for instruction.\n\nKang Cangzi replied: \"Those who transmit such accounts speak falsely. *Shiwen Leiju Houji*, chapter nineteen, includes the character *ye* after *wang*. *Shiwen* glosses *chuan* as pronounced *zhuān*. I can see and hear without employing ears and eyes, but I cannot alter the function of ears and eyes.\"\n\nThe annotation explains: To alter the function of ears and eyes is not to render them entirely without use. If they were entirely without use, the instruments themselves would be discarded.\n\nThe exegesis states: Ears and eyes are the instruments of seeing and hearing; only spirit can employ them. If spirit is absent, even the ears and eyes of a dead man cannot see or hear. Kang Cangzi understood what man is capable of, and thus did not rely on ears and eyes as the masters of seeing and hearing. How could he command ears to see and eyes to hear? This is merely the ignorance of transmitters fabricating explanations.\n\nThe Duke of Lu said: \"This is most extraordinary. What is the nature of your Way? I remain eager to hear it.\"\n\nThe exegesis notes: The Duke of Lu still did not grasp this meaning, instead taking it as an augmentation of wonder, and thus persistently inquired about the Way.\n\nKang Cangzi said: \"My body harmonizes with mind—this is the non-opposition of form and wisdom. Mind harmonizes with qi—this is to further distance the use of form and wisdom, entrusting oneself to the tranquil qi. Qi harmonizes with spirit—this is to be still and unmoving, entirely forgetting wisdom. When wisdom is entirely forgotten, the principle of spirit operates alone, and there is no response it does not penetrate. Spirit harmonizes with nothingness.\"\n\nThe annotation explains: To be one with nothingness is to be spirit; to be one with spirit is to be nothingness. Do these two possess form? Only one who possesses wisdom cannot but draw near to nothingness to achieve communion; one who forgets the mind becomes one with nothingness.\n\nThe exegesis states: The body, having substance, becomes an obstruction; the mind, having attachments, becomes fixation. That the body harmonizes with mind does not lie in physical obstruction but in the fixation of boundaries. Thus, qi in relation to mind, though moving, is without fixation; therefore, that mind harmonizes with qi does not lie in fixation but in dynamic function. That qi harmonizes with spirit does not lie in movement but in clear perception. That spirit harmonizes with nothingness transcends the marvelous beyond form, thus it does not lie in clear perception but in profound union with the real.\n\nBo Jun notes: The *Zhuangzi*, \"Ren Jian Shi\" chapter, states: \"Unify your will; do not listen with the ears, but listen with the mind; do not listen with the mind, but listen with qi. The ears are limited to hearing (this sentence follows Yu Yue’s emendation), the mind is limited to correspondence. Qi is that which is empty and awaits things. Only the Dao gathers in emptiness. Emptiness is the alignment of the mind.\" This likely shares the same meaning. Regarding *jieran zhi you* and *weiran zhi yin*, Sun Yirang says: This passage pairs *you* with *yin*; *you* should likely be *xing*. Lu Chongxuan’s commentary reads, \"Thus there is form, there is sound, no far, no near,\" suggesting Lu’s text originally had *xing*. (*Kang Cangzi Quandao* also follows this passage with *you*.) *Shiwen* glosses *wei* as pronounced *guǐ*.\n\nThough distant in the eight wilds or near at the edge of one’s eyelashes—*Shiwen* glosses *jie* as pronounced *jiē*—whatever comes to engage me, I necessarily know it. The annotation explains: Only the vast openness of nothingness does not engage the sage’s thoughts. Where it touches the realm of differentiation, the illumination of spirit shines without distinction of far or near. *Shiwen* glosses *huo* as pronounced *huò*, and *fen* as pronounced *fèn*.\n\nYet I do not know whether it is my seven apertures and four limbs that perceive it, or my heart, belly, and six viscera that know it—*Shiwen* glosses *zang* as pronounced *cáng*. The five viscera are heart, lungs, liver, spleen, and kidneys. The six viscera include two kidneys: the left is the kidney, the right is the Gate of Life. The Gate of Life is where spirit resides. In men, it stores essence; in women, it connects to the womb. As it communicates with the kidneys, it is said there are six viscera. It is simply self-knowing.\n\nThe annotation explains: Where one’s destination is entirely forgotten, how could there be awareness of such attainment?\n\nThe exegesis states: Thus, whether form or sound, far or near, whatever comes to engage me, I know it all. Without employing the four limbs or seven apertures, it is like a bright mirror hung high, clearly illuminating itself. How could it rely on ears and eyes?\n\nThe Duke of Lu was greatly pleased.",

This aligns with the meaning of the *Yi Lin* quotation.\n\nBo Jun notes: The present two-volume *Kang Cangzi* was forged by Wang Shiyuan, a recluse of Xiangyang during the late Kaiyuan era of the Tang, as seen in the preface to the *Meng Haoran Ji* and the *Da Tang Xin Yu*.\n\nKang Cangzi accepted the invitation and arrived.\"",

      "translated_text": "One day, the Duke told this to Confucius, who smiled but did not answer.\n\n**Annotation:** Kang Cang’s words have exhausted the matter—what more could Confucius say? Yet in not answering, he answers, and so he expresses it with a smile.\n\n**Exegesis:** To express it with a smile is to grasp the purport of forgetting words.\n\nThe Chief Minister of Song—*Fayan Zhulin* (Vol. 20) reads \"Wu’s Chief Minister Pi,\" while *Guang Hongming Ji* (Vol. 1, *Gui Zheng Lun*), *Dui Fu Yi Fei Fo Seng Shi* (Vol. 11), *Fanyi Mingyi Ji*, *Shiwen Leiju* (Front Collection, Vol. 35), and *He Bi Shi Lei* (Front Collection, Vol. 48) all read \"Chief Minister Pi,\" though none are reliable. Lu Wenyu notes: The *Zang* edition reads \"Grand\" instead of \"Great,\" and the same below. Yang Bojun observes: *Han Feizi*’s *Shuo Lin* (Part 1) states, \"Ziyu met Confucius at the Chief Minister of Song’s residence.\" *Shuo Lin* (Part 2) says, \"The Grand Minister of Song was noble and decisive.\" *Nei Chu Shuo* (Part 1) mentions, \"Dai Huan was the Grand Minister of Song,\" and again, \"The Chief Minister of Song sent his young steward to the market.\" Gu Guangqi remarks: \"These all refer to the same person—Song’s Chief Minister, surnamed Dai and named Huan, a high minister of Song.\" The *Analects* (*Zihan* chapter) records: \"The Grand Minister asked Zigong, ‘Is your Master a sage? How is it that he is so versatile?’ Zigong replied, ‘Surely Heaven has endowed him to be a sage, and moreover, he is versatile.’ When the Master heard of this, he said, ‘The Grand Minister knows me! I was poor in my youth, so I acquired many humble skills. Does a noble man need so many? No, he does not.’\" This passage draws from that *Analects* exchange, casting the Grand Minister as the Chief Minister of Song and framing their dialogue. The *Shiwen* reads \"Chief Minister of Song,\" noting: *Da* is pronounced *tai*. Song was also called Shang, as its capital was Shangqiu, hence the two names. \"Grand Minister\" is an official title. Yang Bojun notes: Song was the successor of Shang, hence it was also called Shang. The *Zuozhuan* (Duke Xi, Year 22) states: \"The Chu people attacked Song to rescue Zheng. The Duke of Song prepared for battle, but the Grand Marshal firmly advised, ‘Heaven has long abandoned Shang—if you seek to revive it, you cannot be forgiven!’\" The *Zuozhuan* (Duke Ai, Year 9) also records: \"The historian Gui said, ‘This is called *Chen Yang*—it is auspicious for raising troops, favorable for attacking the Jiang, but inauspicious for Shang. Attacking Qi is permissible, but opposing Song is ill-omened.’\" This confirms the point. Though the state name Shang originally derived from a place name (as discussed in Wang Guowei’s *Guantang Jilin*), the *Shiwen*’s explanation is less precise.\n\nThe Chief Minister of Song asked, \"Is Qiu a sage?\"\nConfucius replied, \"If Qiu dares claim sagacity, how could he be a sage?\"\n\n**Annotation:** What the world calls sages is merely based on their traces—how could they know what makes one a sage or not? Thus, Qiu is merely learned and widely informed.\n\n**Annotation:** He appears learned and widely informed, but in truth, he has nothing to learn and nothing to know. The *Shiwen* reads \"appears\" as *shijian*, noting: *Jian* is pronounced *pian*.\n\nThe Chief Minister of Song asked, \"Were the Three Kings sages?\"\nConfucius replied, \"The Three Kings were adept at employing wisdom and courage—whether they were sages, Qiu does not know.\"\nThe character *fu* (\"not\") in all editions reads *bu* (\"no\"), but this follows the *Daozang* white-text edition and Lin Xiyi’s edition.\n\nHe asked, \"Were the Five Emperors sages?\"\nConfucius replied, \"The Five Emperors were adept at employing benevolence and righteousness—whether they were sages, Qiu does not know.\"\n\nHe asked, \"Were the Three Sovereigns sages?\"\nConfucius replied, \"The Three Sovereigns were adept at following the times—whether they were sages, Qiu does not know.\"\n\n**Annotation:** Confucius’s erudition, Tang and Wu’s martial prowess, Yao and Shun’s yielding, Fuxi and Shen Nong’s simplicity—these are all coarse traces of sages responding to their eras, not what makes them sages. What makes them sages is fundamentally beyond the reach of words and traces.\n\n**Exegesis:** To clarify that the great Dao is not a trace: what later generations expound are merely its traces. Thus, the Master, addressing what people commonly perceive, sought to illuminate the true sage.\n\nThe note \"Confucius\" in the *Shide Tang* edition reads \"Qiu.\" Wang Chongmin observes: The phrase \"adept at following the times\" is semantically incoherent. Likely, the original read \"The Three Sovereigns were adept at following the times,\" with the character *ren* (\"employing\") interpolated due to the preceding phrases \"The Three Kings were adept at employing wisdom and courage\" and \"The Five Emperors were adept at employing benevolence and righteousness.\" Wisdom and courage, benevolence and righteousness, can be \"employed,\" but following the times does not require \"employment.\" Both *Leiju* (Vol. 30) and *Taiping Yulan* (Vol. 401) omit the character *ren*. The *Shiwen* notes: *Pu* (\"simplicity\") is pronounced *pianjiao*.\n\nThe Chief Minister of Song was greatly astonished.\n\n**Annotation:** The world calls them sages, yet Confucius denies their sagacity—hence the Chief Minister’s astonishment.\n\nHe asked, \"Then who is a sage?\"\nYang Bojun notes: The character *zhe* (\"one who\") likely belongs after *sheng* (\"sage\"), originally reading \"who is a sage?\"\n\nConfucius’s expression shifted, and after a pause, he said, \"There are sages among the people of the West.\"\n\n**Annotation:** Is sagacity tied to a fixed place? I speak of it in such distant terms.\n\n\"There are sages who govern without disorder.\"\n\n**Annotation:** They do not govern by governing, so they cannot be disordered.\nYu Yue observes: The original text read \"govern without self-disorder.\" *Luan* (\"disorder\") means \"order\"—it signifies governing without governing. This aligns with the following phrases: \"speak without self-trust,\" \"transform without self-action.\" Later readers, not grasping *luan*’s meaning, altered it to \"without disorder,\" which is incorrect. Zhang’s annotation—\"They do not govern by governing, so they cannot be disordered\"—reflects the error in his base text.",

This is the ultimate perfection of non-action. \"Vast and boundless—people cannot name it.\"\n\n**Annotation:** He Yan’s *Discourse on the Nameless* states: \"To be praised by the people is to have a name; to lack praise is to be nameless. As for the sage, his name is nameless, his praise is unpraiseworthy. To call the nameless the Dao, and the unpraiseworthy great—then the nameless may be spoken of as having a name, and the unpraiseworthy as having praise. Yet how could they be the same in function as those that can be praised or named? This is like comparing them to nothingness, yet they possess all things. Within the realm of possession, they align with nothingness and differ from those that possess. Like attracts like, no matter how distant; unlike repels, no matter how near. It is like yin within yang, or yang within yin—each seeks its own kind. Summer is yang, yet its evenings and nights, far removed, share yin with winter; winter is yin, yet its mornings and days, far removed, share yang with summer. All differ from what is near yet align with what is distant. Only by examining these differences and similarities can the discourse on the nameless be understood. What brings one to this? The Dao is nothingness, possessing nothing. Since the beginning of heaven and earth, all things have possessed something; yet it is still called the Dao because it can once more employ nothingness. Thus, though dwelling in the realm of names, it effaces the form of the nameless; though residing in the distant body of yang, it forgets its own distant kindred in yin.\"\n\nXiahou Xuan said: \"Heaven and earth operate by nature; the sage employs nature. Nature is the Dao. The Dao is originally nameless, hence Laozi said, 'Forced to name it.' Confucius called Yao 'vast and boundless, beyond naming.' Below, he speaks of 'towering success,' which is a forced name, borrowing what the world knows to describe it. How could something with a name then be called 'beyond naming'? Only because it is nameless can it be named with all the names under heaven—yet is that truly its name? This is sufficient to illustrate, yet none comprehend it, like gazing at Mount Tai’s towering majesty and claiming the primal qi lacks vastness.\"\n\n**Note on the Shide Tang Edition:** \"Sufficient\" (*zú*) is written as \"this\" (*shì*); \"vastness\" (*máng*) as \"boundless\" (*máng*).\n\n**Explication of Pronunciation:** *Qiǎng* (\"forced\") is pronounced *qíliǎng*; *wéi* (\"to name\") as *yúwěi*; *biàn* (\"all\") is the same as *piàn*. *Jué* (\"towering\") is pronounced *jiānwù*; *máng* as *máng*.\n\n\"Qi [the Grand Steward] suspected him of being a sage. Did he not know whether he was truly a sage or truly not a sage?\"\n\n**Annotation:** The principle of sagacity is profoundly obscure, hence one can only suspect it.\n\nLiang Zhangju said: \"Praise of the Buddha likely begins here.\"\n\nThe Grand Steward Shang fell silent, pondering in his heart: \"Confucius has deceived me!\"\n\n**Annotation:** This is beyond the grasp of ordinary understanding, so he deemed it deception.\n\n**Explication:** Those who establish traces to exalt teachings, or clarify conduct to inspire transformation, are but worthy sages who save the world. As for one who embodies the great Dao—encompassing all like heaven and earth, transforming like the four seasons—without showing what can be governed yet cannot be disordered, without relying on words to be trusted, overflowing to benefit the myriad things, embracing all sentient beings with life, vast and unfathomable—this is the sage. To lodge him in a place and explain him with words is still insufficient; thus, one resorts to doubt and analogy to convey him. This is what the Grand Steward did not understand, taking it as the Master’s deceit.\n\n**Explication of Pronunciation:** *Mò* (\"silent\") is pronounced *mò*.\n\nZixia asked Confucius: \"What is Yan Hui’s character like?\"\nThe Master said: \"Hui’s benevolence surpasses my own.\"\n\n**Pei Jun’s Note:** In the *Shuo Yuan*’s \"Miscellaneous Sayings\" and the *Kongzi Jiayu* (Book 6), \"benevolence\" (*rén*) is written as \"trustworthiness\" (*xìn*).\n\n\"What is Zigong’s character like?\"\nThe Master said: \"Ci’s eloquence surpasses my own.\"\n\n**Pei Jun’s Note:** In the *Shuo Yuan*’s \"Miscellaneous Sayings\" and the *Kongzi Jiayu* (Book 6), \"eloquence\" (*biàn*) is written as \"quickness\" (*mǐn*).\n\n\"What is Zilu’s character like?\"\nThe Master said: \"You’s courage surpasses my own.\"\n\n\"What is Zizhang’s character like?\"\nThe Master said: \"Shi’s dignity surpasses my own.\"\n\n**Annotation:** That is, solemn dignity.\n\nZixia rose from his mat and asked: \"Then why do these four serve you?\"\nThe Master said: \"Sit!

      "translated_text": "If so, then this \"忍\" (*rěn*) should be read in the same sense as in the *Zuozhuan*'s \"Duke Wen, Year One\": \"Moreover, this man has the eyes of a wasp and the voice of a jackal—he is a *rěn* (cruel) man,\" where *rěn* means \"cruel-hearted\" as used today. \"Ci could be eloquent but could not be reticent\" [*nè*]: [Explanation] He possessed the ability to advance but had not yet ascended to the Dao. **Pei Jun’s Note:** The *Shuo Yuan*'s \"Miscellaneous Sayings\" and *Kongzi Jiayu*'s \"Six Teachings\" both write *nè* (讷) as *qū* (屈). The *Shiwen* notes: *nè* is pronounced *núhū* (奴忽). \"You could be courageous but could not be timid\": [Explanation] He knew only the masculine but could not abide by the feminine. \"Shi could be dignified but could not be accommodating.\" [Annotation] To be eloquent yet unable to be reticent is to lack the substance of loyalty and trust; to be courageous yet unable to be timid is to harm the Dao of benevolence and forbearance; to be dignified yet unable to be accommodating is to violate the principle of harmonizing and concealing one’s brilliance—all of these are fixations on one aspect. [Explanation] To be self-guarded and austere yet unable to harmonize with others is to lose the virtue of harmony.\n\nXu Shidong says: In the *Analects*, \"Master Zeng said, 'How imposing Zhang is!'\"—this is what is meant by \"dignified\"; and \"It is difficult to join him in practicing benevolence\"—this is what is meant by \"unable to be accommodating.\"\n\n\"Even if I could exchange my Way for the combined virtues of the Four Masters, I would not consent.\" [Annotation] Each of the Four Masters embodies the extreme of a single practice; even if they were combined, to seek to exchange my Dao for theirs is not something I would permit. **Pei Jun’s Note:** This *yì* (易) should be understood as \"exchange,\" not \"transformation.\" Zhang’s annotation, interpreting it as \"transformation,\" is incorrect; Lu’s explanation as \"exchange\" is correct. The *Shiwen* notes: *xíng* (行) is pronounced *xiàmèng* (下孟).\n\n\"This is why they served me without divided loyalty.\" [Annotation] Gathering and uniting must be entrusted to the sage, and thus one cannot cease even if one wished to. [Explanation] Even if one possessed the combined virtues of benevolence, eloquence, dignity, and courage, I would still not exchange my Way for theirs—how much less so for those who cannot combine them? The Master could encompass what the Four Masters could not, and thus they served him without divided hearts. This discussion concerns the greatness of the Dao, which is further elaborated in the chapter on \"Concealment and Manifestation.\"\n\nThe *Shiwen* notes: *èr* (贰) means \"doubt\"; *yāo* (要) is pronounced *yīyáo* (一遥).\n\nAfter Master Liezi had studied under Master Hulu Zi Lin—[Annotation] a teacher who daily diminished [his attachments]—and befriended Bohun Maoren, the *Shiwen* notes: *mào* (瞀) is pronounced *mòhóu* (莫侯), he then resided in the southern outskirts. The *Shiwen* notes: One version writes \"反居\" (*fǎn jū*, \"returned to reside\") instead of \"乃居\" (*nǎi jū*, \"then resided\"). **Pei Jun’s Note:** The *Taiping Yulan* (406) correctly cites it as \"反.\"\n\nThose who followed him were so numerous that even daily reckoning could not keep pace. [Annotation] Visitors came in an unbroken stream; even if one tallied them day by day, one could not exhaust the count. Hu Huaichen says: \"日\" (*rì*, \"day\") is a corruption of \"百\" (*bǎi*, \"hundred\"). \"Hundreds tallied yet not exhausted\" means that those who followed Liezi were so numerous that none could match him. The *Huangdi* chapter states, \"The gulls that came numbered in the hundreds yet did not cease\" (*Lüshi Chunqiu* writes \"数\" [*shù*, \"count\"]), which shares the same structure and serves as evidence. Wang Shumin says: The *Chuxue Ji* (18) cites \"游\" (*yóu*, \"travel\") for \"处\" (*chǔ*, \"reside\") and \"百\" for \"日\"; the *Taiping Yulan* (404) also writes \"百\" for \"日.\" It is likely that \"百\" is the correct character. The *Shiwen* notes: *shù* (数) is pronounced *sèzhǔ* (色主); *liào* (料) is pronounced *liáo* (聊).\n\nNevertheless, Master Liezi was also somewhat obscure. [Annotation] Liezi himself did not know their number. Yu Yue says: *wēi* (微) means \"dim.\" The *Zhouyi*'s *Tuan* commentary on *Zhun* states, \"Heaven creates in the midst of dimness.\" The *Zhengyi* cites Dong Yu: \"*mèi* (昧) means subtle things.\" The *Xici* commentary states, \"To know the subtle and know the manifest.\" The *Wen Xuan*'s commentary on the *Western Capital Rhapsody* cites an old annotation: \"To know the subtle is to know the dim.\" Thus, *wēi* (微) and *mèi* (昧) share the same meaning. \"Master Liezi was also somewhat *wēi*\" is equivalent to saying \"Master Liezi was also somewhat *mèi*.\" Hence, Zhang’s annotation states, \"He himself did not know their number.\" Tao Hongqing says: *wēi* means \"subtle.\" The *Xunzi*'s \"Discourse on Warfare\" states, \"The feudal lords possess the ability to be subtle and refined in their regulations.\" Yang’s commentary: \"*wēimiào* (微妙) means utmost precision.\" This passage says that Liezi’s arts were subtle, which is why, though his disciples were many, he could daily engage with them in debate and be heard far and wide. Later in this chapter: \"Long Shu said to Wen Zhi, 'Your arts are subtle! I have an illness—can you cure it?'\" The *Tang Wen* chapter states, \"Master Xiang then clapped his chest, stamped his feet, and exclaimed, 'Your playing is subtle!'\" Both refer to the subtlety of the arts, which confirms the meaning of this passage. Zhang’s annotation, \"Liezi himself did not know their number,\" and Yu’s interpretation of *wēi* as *mèi* are both incorrect.\n\nDay after day, they debated without ceasing, and nothing went unheard. [Annotation] Master and disciples engaged in teaching and practice, their voices carrying far and wide. [Explanation] Since his followers were so numerous that Liezi could not tally them, he daily discoursed on the traces of the sages, and nothing went unheard.\n\nYet for twenty years, he and Master Nanguo lived as neighbors, sharing a wall, without ever visiting or sending inquiries. [Annotation] Their Ways were profoundly aligned, and thus, even in old age, they did not exchange visits. When they encountered each other on the road, their eyes seemed not to see. [Annotation] When the Dao is present, sight is abandoned.\n\nHis disciples and followers suspected that Master Liezi and Master Nanguo were enemies. [Annotation] *dí* (敌) means \"enemy.\" [Explanation] The crowd suspected enmity, seeing that they did not exchange visits. **Pei Jun’s Note:** Later in the text, \"Among the disciples of Puze there was one named Bo Fengzi,\" the annotation states: \"*yì* (役) means 'disciple.'\" The *Zhuangzi*'s \"Gengsang Chu\" chapter states, \"Laozi had a disciple named Gengsang Chu,\" and the *Shiwen* cites Sima: \"*yì* (役) means 'student disciple.'\" Hence, \"disciples and followers\" are mentioned together.",
      "overlap_context": "be timid; Shi could be dignified but could not be accommodating.\" The *Huainanzi*'s \"Among Men\" chapter also records this matter, stating: \"Qiu could be benevolent and yet *rěn* (忍), eloquent and yet reticent, courageous and yet timid.\" Here, the character is correctly written as *rěn* (忍), providing clear proof. Zhang’s annotation, \"反 means 'to change,'\" shows that the text he relied upon was already corrupted. The Lu edition concurs.\n\n**Pei Jun’s Note:** Yu Yue’s argument is highly persuasive.",

      "translated_text": "Here the *Exegesis* states: Standing with one’s back to the light is to revert to the concerns of the common and vulgar; facing the light to observe is to look up and measure the heart that reaches toward the supreme Dao. The emptiness of the square inch arises from clinging to the written word; the one aperture that remains unopened means that perfection is not yet complete. Now, if all seven apertures were freely flowing, would one still take the Dao of sagely wisdom as an affliction? This affliction is not something Wenzi’s shallow art can cure.\n\nQin Enfu remarks: The *Exegesis*’s “clinging to the written word” may be a corruption of the two characters *shì jìn* (“power exhausted”). Bo Jun notes: The *Exegesis*’s “look up and measure” should likely read “look up and fathom.”\n\nThat which arises without cause and yet is ever-generative is the Dao.\n*Annotation*: To forget all cares and let things pass, whether in success or failure, is to be without fatal ground—this is the Dao of the sage.\n*Exegesis*: The supreme Dao abides constantly, not dependent on external things. It arises from life and so lives on, and thus, though it may come to an end, it does not perish—this is constancy.\n*Annotation*: Laozi says, “That which dies yet does not perish is longevity.” To grasp the principle of life’s continuity without losing the primal meeting of supreme good fortune—even when it comes to death—is the way by which the Dao of life abides constantly. This is the portion allotted to the worthy, not that which can be attained by forgetting all cares and obscurely attaining spontaneity in its fullness.\n*Exegesis*: True constancy follows principle, moving with the transformations of life and death while never perishing—this is the constancy of the Dao.\n\n*Shiwen* notes: *fèn* (“portion”) is read as *fú wèn* (“to inquire”).\n\nThat which arises from life and yet perishes is misfortune.\n*Annotation*: To employ cunning in pursuit of self-preservation, to value the self and demean things, to turn from harm and seek profit, to be inwardly bound while outwardly driven—even if one comes to death, it is due to misfortune.\n*Exegesis*: To covet life and lose the Dao is misfortune.\n\nSome versions read “pursue self-preservation” as “bind the self.”\n\nThat which arises without cause and yet is ever-dying is also the Dao.\n*Annotation*: To follow the principle of certain death and proceed to a place of certain death—this correspondence of fact and principle is also the natural Dao.\n*Exegesis*: The common understanding of ritual and teaching is that one must part and come to death.\n\nThat which arises from death and so dies—though it may not yet have reached its end, it perishes of itself—is also constancy.\n*Annotation*: To be constant in death, though one may not yet have reached the end, is to have already exhausted the principle of life—this too is the constancy of principle.\n*Exegesis*: To cherish the body of life and death, to practice the teachings of life and death, and not to preserve the Dao—this the common take to be constancy.\n\nIn all versions, the character *yě* (“also”) is missing below “is also constancy”; here it is supplied following the Jifu edition.\n\nThat which arises from death and yet lives is good fortune.\n*Annotation*: To violate principle and defy the natural order, to be due for death yet not yet reach it—this is mistaken life.\n*Exegesis*: To dwell in the work of change and decline while moderating one’s desires is also to know the good fortune of life.\n\n*Shiwen* reads: “That which arises from death and yet lives is misfortune,” noting that most versions lack the character *bù* (“not”). The text above seems incomplete in principle, so it has been added here.\n\nRen Dachun states: In the current text, the character *bù* (“not”) is missing below “lives.” Upon examination, there should be a *bù* below “lives.” The meaning of this passage is structured in parallel pairs: just as that which follows the Dao of life and dies is misfortune, so too is that which follows the Dao of death and lives also misfortune. Jing Shun’s explanation that there should be a *bù* below “lives” aligns perfectly with the parallel structure of this passage and should be taken as the definitive version.\n\nBo Jun notes: Yin’s and Ren’s interpretations may be debated; the explanation by Tao Hongqing below is smoother.\n\nThus, to live without employing [the Dao] is called the Dao; to employ the Dao and attain one’s end is called constancy.\n*Annotation*: To employ the Dao of the sage is to accord with principle in life and death.\nTo die while employing [the Dao] is also called the Dao; to employ the Dao and attain death is also called constancy.\n*Annotation*: To ride the principle of peril and harm to one’s own destruction is also the constancy of the Dao.\n*Exegesis*: Not to employ cunning in pursuit of self-preservation is the Dao; to employ this Dao and reach one’s end is constancy. The common scholar employs his cunning to the point of death, taking this as the Dao of aiding others; to employ this Dao and reach death is also called constancy.\n\nWhat the multitude delights in, the multitude takes as the Dao; what the multitude finds secure, the multitude takes as constancy. Thus, the Dao of transcendence and the Dao of the worldly realm share the same name but differ in substance.\n\nTao Hongqing states: “That which arises without cause and yet is ever-dying is also the Dao”—Zhang’s annotation reads: “To follow the principle of certain death and proceed to a place of certain death—this correspondence of fact and principle is also the natural Dao.” If this is so, then it is entirely indistinguishable from what is called “that which arises from death and so dies,” and its meaning is even more incongruous with the earlier “that which arises without cause and yet is ever-generative is the Dao.” “To live without employing [the Dao]” and “to die while employing [the Dao]”—*yòng* (“employ”) is also *yóu* (“cause”). From “to live without employing [the Dao]” onward, the four sentences do not differ in meaning from the text above. Moreover, having said “to employ the Dao and attain one’s end is called constancy,” to then say “to employ the Dao and attain death is also called constancy” is to equate “end” and “death,” which is not the style of this text. The passage is verbose in wording and obscure in meaning, easily leading to errors in transmission; after being tampered with by the unlearned, it has become the corrupted version we have today. After examining the intent of this text, I venture to correct its wording as follows, leaving it as a matter for further consideration:\n\nThat which arises without cause and yet is ever-generative is the Dao. It arises from life and so lives on, and thus, though it may come to an end, it does not perish—this is constancy. That which arises from life and yet perishes is misfortune. That which arises without cause and yet is ever-dying is the Dao. It arises from death and so dies, and thus, though it may not yet have reached its end, it perishes of itself—this is constancy. That which arises from death and yet lives is good fortune. To live while employing [the Dao] is also called the Dao; to employ the Dao and attain life is also called constancy. To die while employing [the Dao] is also called the Dao; to employ the Dao and attain death is also called constancy.",

The Zi River emerges from Laiwu County in the Lu Commandery; the Sheng River flows west from the border of Qiancheng County in the Beihai Commandery to Shouguang County, where the two waters converge. The *Shuofu* chapter states: \"When the Zi and Sheng waters mix, Yi Ya could taste them.\" *Bie* (别), *bei lie* cut, same below.\nBo Jun observes: The source of the Zi River is twenty-five *li* west of the abandoned county seat of Boshan, on the northern side of Yuanshan, flowing through Linzi Town and east of Guangrao County into the Xiaoqing River. The Sheng River flows northwest from outside the ancient Qi city in Linzi Town, passing southwest of Guangrao County and emptying into Mada Lake.\n\nThe nose about to be blocked first detects the scent of burning and decay.\n**[Note]** Burning and decay have the qi of nodes—subtle and difficult to distinguish.\n\nThe body about to stiffen first hastens to run and flee.\n**[Note]** *Jiang* (僵) means to fall. Like Yan Yuan knowing that Dongye’s driving of the horses would lead to a runaway—it is the same with human affairs.\n**[Note]** In the *Four Explanations* edition, the character \"之\" appears after \"人.\"\n**[Phonetic Gloss]** *Jiang* (僵), read as *jiang* (姜). *Ji* (亟), *qu li* cut. *Fangyan* states: \"亟 means to receive.\" *Ben yi* (奔佚), read as *ben yi* (奔逸). *Pu* (仆), read as *fu* (赴).\nBo Jun observes: \"亟 *receives*\"—\"receives\" (*shou* 受) should be \"loves\" (*ai* 愛).\n\nThe mind about to be deluded first discerns right and wrong.\n**[Note]** The eyes, ears, mouth, nose, body, and mind—these six constantly attain the Dao of harmony and cannot be altered or changed. Occupying an extreme position, none do not suddenly come to an end. Thus, the decay of things must first begin with fullness, and then proceed to loss. Reaching the peak and turning downward, extreme prosperity must decline—this is the natural principle.\n\nTherefore, the sage dwells in the center and treads the path of harmony, seeing what the eyes see, hearing what the ears hear, following the body’s abilities, and yielding to the mind’s discernment. Thus, their wisdom encompasses all things, and they preserve their wholeness throughout life.\n**[Explanation]** When the mouth loses its proper taste, it distinguishes other flavors; when the nose loses its sense of smell, it detects other scents; when the body is about to stiffen, it first hastens to run; when the mind is deluded about the Dao, it is due to right and wrong. Right and wrong thus become manifest, and the Dao is thereby lost.\n**[Note]** In the phrase \"cannot be altered or changed,\" the character *yu* (渝) appears as *ce* (侧) in the Northern Song edition and as *ce* (测) in the *Daozang* and *Shidetang* editions.\n**[Phonetic Gloss]** *Yu* (渝), read as *yu* (俞). *Kang* (亢) is the same as *kang* (抗).\n\nThus, that which does not reach its limit does not return.",

Hence it is said: one who sees the tip of an autumn hair cannot perceive Mount Tai; one who hears the buzz of a mosquito cannot hear the crash of thunder. Thus *Zhuangzi* declares: “Obstruct the eyes of Li Zhu, and all under heaven become clear; cripple the fingers of Gongshu, and all under heaven become skillful.” To combine the teachings of Confucians and Mohists, to pride oneself on the wealth of right and wrong, to treasure the dregs of learning as ability—how can one return to the real? By what means can it be attained? Therefore, the *Yijing* states: “No thought, no action. Still and unmoving, yet responsive and penetrating.” This is how the sage earnestly pursues the supreme Dao.\n\n**[Lu Deming’s Note]** The *Zhuangzi* passage cited in Lu’s exegesis is an abridged distillation of the essential meaning of the *Qieqie* chapter, not the original text.\n\n**[Phonetic Gloss]** *Zao* (造), read as *qidao* (七到切). *Huan* (还), read as *xuan* (旋).\n\nThe marshes of Zheng’s fields teemed with worthies—**[Annotation]** those of virtue and power who remained hidden and silent. **[Phonetic Gloss]** *Puze* (圃泽), the marsh of Putian, located in Zhongmou County.\n\n—while Dongli abounded in talent—**[Annotation]** those with administrative skill who participated in state governance. **[Exegesis]** Those who cultivate and exalt the Dao are worthy; those who study texts and scrutinize punishments are talented. **[Phonetic Gloss]** *Zhi* (治), read as *zhili* (直吏切).\n\nAmong the disciples of Puze was one named Bo Fengzi—*yi* (役) here meaning “disciple.” As he passed through Dongli, he encountered Deng Xi. **[Annotation]** Deng Xi was a persuasive and cunning scholar of Zheng, who wielded the doctrine of “two possibilities” with no equal in his time.

The *Zhou Li*’s “Turtle Catcher” says: “They fence fish, turtles, and clams in season.” The *Guo Yu* also states: “They net and trap fish.” *Zhuangzi* says: “They stand over the pigpen.” Li Yi comments: “*Lao* is the pigsty; *zha* (栅) is the wooden fence.” Though the characters differ, the meaning is the same. *Cuo* (簎) is pronounced *zha* (栅). *Pao* (庖) is pronounced *pao* (匏).\n\nQin Enfu notes: In the current *Zhuangzi* text, this reads “pen and whip” (*lao ce* 牢策). “How is this any different from the class of dogs and swine?”\n\nBo Fengzi did not respond.\n\n**[Annotation]** Not that he could not respond, but he scorned the question and did not answer.\n\n**[Exegesis]** He deemed him unworthy of discourse, as one fundamentally unfit for conversation.\n\n**[Annotation]** The character *ji* (讥, “scorn”) in the *Shi De Tang* edition is written as *ji* (机, “opportunity”).\n\nOne of Bo Fengzi’s followers stepped out of turn and said:\n\n**[Phonetic Gloss]** *Cong* (从), read as *cai yong* (才用切).\n\n“Has my lord never heard of the many skilled artisans in Qi and Lu?\n\n**[Annotation]** *Ji* (机) means “skill.” There are many people of exceptional ability: some excel in earthworks and carpentry, some in metalwork and leathercraft, some in music, some in calligraphy and mathematics, some in military affairs, and some in ancestral rites.

The *Zhou Li*’s “Master of Ceremonies” states: “For all military and hunting expeditions where sacrifices are made to the earth and ancestral altars, they establish positions.” The commentary notes: “The old text writes *wei* (位) as *li* (莅),” showing that *wei* and *li* were interchangeable in ancient script.\n\n**[Phonetic Gloss]** *Zhi* (智) is written as *zhi* (知), read as *zhi* (智).

This is because they do not occupy the position of knowledge or ability, harboring no aversions or preferences, no “this” or “that,” and thus act with a mind of non-action.\n\nTherefore, the clear-sighted see for them, the keen-eared hear for them, the wise plan for them, the brave fight for them, and they themselves remain without concern.\n\nXun Can said to Fu Gu and Xiahou Xuan: “While you live in this world, your fame and achievements surpass mine, but your understanding falls short.” Fu and Xiahou replied: “Success and fame depend on understanding.

      "translated_text": "Observing his appearance, he was but a cowardly man. **[Note]** *Cowardly* means weak. The *Cang* edition omits the four characters “pronounced *nu luan* cut.” The *Shiwen* reads: *Cowardly* is pronounced *nuan*.\n\nKing Xuan, perplexed in his heart, doubted and asked: “How great is your strength?” The *Shiwen* reads: *You* is pronounced *ru*.\n\nGongyi Bo replied: “Your servant’s strength can break the leg of a spring katydid,” the *Shiwen* reads: *Break* is pronounced *zhe*. *Katydid* is pronounced *zhong*; another says it is a locust. *Leg* is pronounced *gu*. “And bear the wing of an autumn cicada.” **[Note]** *Bear* means to endure. Yu Yue says: *Bear* should be read as *kan*. The *Shuowen*, under the *ge* radical, states: “*Kan* means to pierce.” The leg of a spring katydid is slender, hence the word *break*—showing that he can snap it. The wing of an autumn cicada is thin, hence the word *kan*—showing that he can pierce it. *Bear* here is a loan character. The *Book of Documents* reads: “The Western Earl having *kan*-subdued Li.” The *Erya*’s *Shigu* commentary cites it as written *kan*, proof that these characters were interchangeable in antiquity. Zhang’s note says “*Bear* means to endure,” but then katydid legs could also be said to *bear*, which fails to capture the precision of the ancients’ language. Hu Huaichen says: *Endure* means to bear the weight. The ancients often used the cicada’s wing to denote the lightest of things. “To *bear* a cicada’s wing” means to support its weight.\n\nThe king changed countenance and said: “My strength can rend the hide of a rhinoceros or young buffalo and drag the tails of nine oxen.” The *Shide Tang* edition adds the character *zhe* after *strength*. The *Shiwen* reads: *Rend* may also be written as *fen*. *Young buffalo* is pronounced *zi*. *Drag* is pronounced *yi*. “Yet I still regret its weakness. You break the leg of a spring katydid and bear the wing of an autumn cicada, yet your strength is renowned throughout the world—why?” The *Shiwen* reads: *Regret* is pronounced *han*.\n\nGongyi Bo sighed deeply, withdrew from his mat, and said: “Excellent is the king’s question! Your servant dares to answer truthfully. Your servant’s teacher is one named Shangqiu Zi, whose strength is unmatched in the world, yet his kin do not know of it—because he has never employed his strength.” **[Note]** He governs things with the utmost suppleness; nothing opposes him, so his achievement is not manifest.\n\n“I would die for him. He instructed your servant, saying: ‘If one wishes to see what others cannot see, one must observe what others do not peer at; if one wishes to obtain what others cannot obtain, one must cultivate what others do not practice.’” **[Note]** Others always attack what is difficult; I alone do what is easy. **[Explanation]** What the multitude does and sees are but the paths of profit and fame, the traces of action. What the multitude does not peer at or practice is where the man of the Dao roams. Thus, one who is unmatched in the world has no opposing force.\n\nWang Lai says: In the explanation, there should be a *not* before *peer*. The *Shiwen* reads: *Easy* is pronounced *yi*, the same below.\n\n“Therefore, one who studies vision first sees a cartload of firewood; one who studies hearing first hears the tolling of a bell.” The *Shiwen* reads: *Cart* is pronounced *yu*. *Bell* is pronounced *zhong*.\n\n“For one who has ease within, there is no difficulty without.” **[Note]** The ancients said: One skilled in strength lifts the autumn down; one skilled in hearing perceives the thunderclap—this is what is meant. The *Shiwen* reads: *Thunderclap* is pronounced *ting*.\n\n“With no difficulty without, one’s name does not leave one’s household.” **[Note]** The Dao’s ultimate achievement is mysterious, so one’s name is not proclaimed. **[Explanation]** A cartload of firewood is a nearby thing; the tolling of a bell is a great sound. What is easily heard and seen proceeds from near to far. One who is skilled in living first nurtures his spirit. When the spirit is whole, the achievement of non-action becomes manifest, and no external thing is not penetrated. Thus it is said: One who has ease within has no difficulty without. This is attained in the single mind and perfected in the single household, so outsiders do not know.\n\n“Thus one’s name does not leave one’s household.” The Northern Song edition, *Cang* edition, Qin engraving of Lu Chongxuan’s edition, and Wang’s edition read *household*; the Jifu edition and *Shide Tang* edition read *household*. Qin Enfu says: Lu’s commentary also reads *household*. Wang Zhongmin says: The Northern Song edition’s *household* as *Dao* is nearly correct; Zhang’s note, “The Dao’s ultimate achievement is mysterious,” etc., proves this. **[Chen Bohjun’s Note]** Wang’s view seems unexamined. Zhang’s note, “The Dao’s ultimate achievement is mysterious,” precisely explains the principle of “not leaving one household,” and further states, “thus one’s name is not proclaimed.” “One’s name is not proclaimed” precisely explains the meaning of “not leaving one household.” “One’s name does not leave one’s household” directly follows the preceding “his kin do not know” and contrasts with the following “your servant’s name is heard among the feudal lords.” Its corruption to *Dao* was precisely due to Zhang’s note, “The Dao’s ultimate achievement is mysterious.” Now we follow the Jifu and *Shide Tang* editions to correct it. The *Shiwen* reads: One edition writes *one Dao*, but this does not extend the meaning.\n\n“Now your servant’s name is heard among the feudal lords—this is your servant’s violation of his teacher’s teaching and the display of his ability.” **[Note]** He has not yet been able to prevent his name and traces from being manifest.\n\n“Yet your servant’s name is not due to failing to bear his strength,” **[Note]** He still avoids boasting, thus able to attain renown. The *Cang* edition’s note reads *more* for *still*, and *attain this* for *attain renown*. “But to being able to employ his strength.” **[Note]** One who skillfully employs his strength does not employ his strength.\n\n“Is this not better than failing to bear one’s strength?” **[Note]** Boasting of ability and displaying its use. **[Explanation]** Though I do not match my teacher’s concealment of his traces, how is this not better than bearing one’s ability and displaying oneself?",

      "translated_text": "The one who unites with the Great Dao to transform the myriad things does so by virtue of his power. Thus Zhuangzi said: “Hiding a mountain in a marsh, concealing a boat in a ravine—one of great power could shoulder them away at midnight, yet the deluded would remain unaware.” Yet King Xuan mistook this for mere physical strength.\n\nWang Lai said: The explanation for *you* should include the two characters *yuyu* (“better than”).\n\nZhongshan Gongzi Mou was a worthy prince of the state of Wei. **[Note]** Gongzi Mou, son of Marquis Wen, composed four chapters, which were classified as Daoist. When Wei conquered Zhongshan, it enfeoffed the land to Mou, hence he was called Zhongshan Gongzi Mou. **[Explanation]** Gongzi Mou was the son of Marquis Wen, enfeoffed at Zhongshan, thus called Zhongshan Gongzi.\n\nSun Yirang said: The Zhongshan of Xianyu was first conquered by Wei when, in the seventeenth year of Marquis Wen, Yue Yang besieged it for three years before annexing it, granting the land to Zi Ji. Later, Ji was established as crown prince, and the second son, Zhi, was enfeoffed instead. After Zhongshan regained its independence, it was again conquered by Zhao in the fourth year of King Huiwen. Both events are recorded in the *Records of the Grand Historian* under the hereditary houses of Wei and Zhao, as well as in the biography of Yue Yi. The *Liezi*’s “Zhongni” chapter, the *Zhuangzi*’s “Rang Wang” chapter, the *Lüshi Chunqiu*’s “Shen Wei” chapter, and the *Huainanzi*’s “Dao Ying Xun” all refer to Wei’s Zhongshan Gongzi Mou. Gao You and Zhang Zhan both state that Wei conquered Zhongshan and enfeoffed it to Mou. However, Wei Mou was contemporaneous with Zhao’s Lord Pingyuan, Qin’s Wei Dan, and Fan Sui, by which time Zhongshan had long been under Zhao’s control—how could it still belong to Wei? Thus, Mou’s enfeoffment must not have been in Xianyu’s Zhongshan, and this is beyond doubt. Zhang Zhan further identified Mou as the son of Marquis Wen of Wei, conflating Mou with Zhi, which is particularly erroneous—Yang Liang had already expressed skepticism about this.\n\nBo Jun’s note: The *Han Shu*’s “Yi Wen Zhi” lists *Gongzi Mou* in four chapters under Daoist works.\n\nBo Jun’s further note: Qian Mu’s *Xian Qin Zhuzi Xinian Kaobian*’s “Wei Mou Kao” states: Later scholars suspect the *Liezi* to be a forgery by Zhang Zhan, yet passages like this one demonstrate profound and exceptional reasoning, likely derived from ancient texts or remnants of the four chapters, which Zhang could not have fabricated.\n\nShen Qinkan said: Zhang Zhan’s note reads, “Gongzi Mou, son of Marquis Wen.” By the time of Gongsun Long, over a hundred years had passed since Marquis Wen—he could not have been his son. The *Shiwen* notes: *Mou* is pronounced *mohou*.\n\nHe delighted in associating with worthy men and neglected state affairs. The *Shiwen* notes: *Delighted* is pronounced *hubaor*; *neglected* is pronounced *suilü*. He took pleasure in the company of the Zhao man Gongsun Long. **[Note]** Gongzi Mou and Gongsun Long appear to postdate Liezi, yet they are mentioned here—this may be a later interpolation to expand the text’s meaning. If such additions do not violate the work’s general principles and serve to clarify its ideas, what harm do they do? Passages like these are preserved without removal.\n\nBo Jun’s note: The *Han Shu*’s “Yi Wen Zhi” lists *Gongsun Longzi* in fourteen chapters under the School of Names. The present edition contains five chapters and two thousand characters, though some suspect it to be a later forgery.\n\nThe disciples of Yuezheng Ziyu laughed at him. The *Shiwen* notes: *Yu* is pronounced *she*.\n\nGongzi Mou said: “Why do you laugh at my delight in Gongsun Long?”\n\nZiyu said: “Gongsun Long’s character is such that his conduct follows no teacher. The *Shiwen* notes: *Conduct* is pronounced *hang*. He studies without companions. **[Note]** He does not model himself on the sages and worthies. He is glib and unprincipled. **[Note]** Though talented in debate, he does not accord with reason. The *Shiwen* notes: *Accord* is pronounced *zhong*. He is recklessly expansive and without a school. **[Note]** The teachings of Confucians, Mohists, Legalists, and Logicians are all jumbled together without a fixed school. The *Cang* edition and *Sijie* read *fixed school* as *a single fixed school*. The *Shiwen* notes: *Recklessly* is pronounced *man*; *expansive* is pronounced *yan*. He favors the strange and speaks absurdly. **[Note]** He loves the bizarre and makes baseless claims. He seeks to confuse men’s minds and subdue their speech, practicing this with Han Tan and the like.” **[Note]** Han Tan is a person’s name, who studied this art together with him.\n\nZhuangzi said: “In the state of Huan, Gongsun Long could overpower men’s speech but not win their hearts—he was confined to the realm of disputation.” **[Explanation]** His conduct did not follow a teacher; he studied alone without companions. Though eloquent, he did not accord with reason, and his Way was recklessly expansive without a foundation. His teachings could subdue men’s speech but not win their hearts.\n\nHan Tan, as in Zhuangzi, is called Huan Tuan—both are names of persons, similar in sound. The note *Huan Guo* should follow the *Shiwen* and read *Huan Tuan*. *Confined* was originally written as *gu* (“solid”), but here it is corrected to *you* (“realm”) following the *Cang* edition. The *Shiwen* reads *guo* as *tuan*, noting: *Tan* is pronounced *bu’an*; *practiced* is pronounced *yi’er*. *Tuan* is pronounced *daduan*; *confined* is pronounced *you*.\n\nBo Jun’s note: *Tan* should not be pronounced *bu’an* (*bu’an* in *Guangyun* is *tugan*); the *bu* is likely an error. *Practiced* should not be pronounced *yi’er* (*yi’er* in *Guangyun* is *yangzhi*); the *ge* should be *yi* (both *yangzhi* and *yier* belong to the *yu* initial and *zhi* final).\n\nGongzi Mou’s expression changed as he said: “Why do you depict Gongsun Long’s faults in this way? Pray, let me hear the truth.”",

      "translated_text": "Ziyu said: “I laugh at how Long deceived Kong Chuan.” 〔Annotation〕 Kong Chuan was Confucius’ grandson. The *Shiji* records him as Long’s disciple. *Deceived* means “to cheat.” The *Shiwen* notes: *Deceived* is pronounced *dai*; it means “to cheat.” The same applies below.\n\nHe spoke of “a master archer who can make the rear arrowhead strike the front nock,” with the *Shiwen* noting: *Arrowhead* is pronounced *zu* (as in *zuomu*). *Strike* is pronounced *zhong* (as in *dingzhong*); the same applies below and in the annotation. “The arrows follow one another in succession, each shaft linked to the next.” The *Shiwen* notes: *Linked* is pronounced *zhu* (as in *zhu*), the same as in the annotation. “The front arrow reaches the target without break or fall, while the nock of the rear arrow still holds the bowstring, appearing as one.” 〔Annotation〕 The arrows are connected without interruption; the front arrow hits the target, and the next arrow strikes the front one, so that what the latter joins still holds the bowstring, appearing as a single continuous object. The *Shiwen* notes: *Hits* is pronounced *zhuo* (as in *zhilüe*); the same applies below. *Target* is pronounced *peng*. *Again* is pronounced *fu* (as in *fuyou*); the same applies below. *Joins* is pronounced *cou* (as in *qidou*).\n\nKong Chuan was astonished. Long said: “This is not yet the most marvelous.” Wang Chongmin notes: The *Taiping Yulan* (745) includes the character *ji* (“ascend”) after *not yet*.\n\nAmong Feng Meng’s disciples was one named Hong Chao. The *Shiwen* notes: *Feng* is pronounced *peng* (as in *bojing*). Enraged at his wife, he sought to frighten her. He drew the *Wuhao* bow and the *Qiwei* arrows. 〔Annotation〕 *Wuhao* was the bow of the Yellow Emperor. *Qi* was a place known for fine arrows. *Wei* refers to the fletching. Wang Chongmin notes: Wang Yinzhi first treated *Qiwei* as a single term, arguing that both were names for arrow bamboo. His explanation states: “The *Fangyan* says: *Bo* is sometimes called *jianli* or *qi*. The *Zhupu* says, ‘□ is *bo* bamboo for arrows.’ If □ is *bo* bamboo called *qi*, then when used for archery, it is also called *qi*. The *Huainanzi*’s *Binglüe* chapter annotation says, ‘Qiwei bamboo is where arrows come from.’ The *Zhupu* cites *Huainanzi* and explains: *Qiyuan* is the land of *Wei*, as in the *Mao Shi*’s ‘Gazing upon that *Qi* bend, the green bamboo so lush.’ *Qi* is the name of a river in *Wei*; to place *Qi* before *Wei* is ungrammatical.” Wang’s view that *Wei* is not a place name is correct, but his claim that *Qi* is also a name for arrow bamboo is likely mistaken. If *Wuhao* is the finest bow, then *Qiwei* should likewise denote the finest arrows. *Bo* arrows differ from archery arrows—can *bo* arrows be considered the finest for archery? The *Huainanzi*’s *Binglüe* chapter reads “Qiwei bamboo”; if all are names for arrow bamboo, why does the *Guangya*’s *Shicao* section list only *junlu* and *□* as arrow bamboo, omitting *Qi*? The theory that *Qi* (or *Qiwei*) refers to arrow bamboo lacks ancient evidence, as Zhang Ji also noted. The *Zhupu* says: “□ is fine.” *Qi* here is simply the *Qiyuan* of *Wei*. *Qiwei* thus refers to the fine bamboo of *Qiyuan*. Arrows made from *Qiyuan*’s fine bamboo could match the strength of the *Wuhao* bow, crafted from mulberry and *zhe* wood. Moreover, if *Qiwei* were arrow bamboo and *jun* were also arrow bamboo, how could they not pair? Wang’s argument is overly rigid. As for *Qiwei*, the *Huainanzi*’s *Yuandao* chapter writes it as *Qiwei*, while the *Binglüe* chapter uses *Qiwei*—both are loan characters; the standard form should be *Qiwei*. The *Taiping Yulan* (745), citing the *Liezi*, also writes it as *Qiwei*. Further, the *Shiming* states: “The side of an arrow is called *yu* (‘fletching’); the people of Qi call it *wei*.” Zhang’s annotation—“*Wei* means fletching”—derives from this. The *Shiwen* notes: *Hao* is pronounced *hao* (as in *hugao*). *Qi* is pronounced *qi* (as in *qiji*).

      "translated_text": "The arrow came to lodge in her pupil, yet her eyelids did not blink. Wang Chongmin notes: The *Taiping Yulan* (350) cites “came” as “not yet,” matching the *Shiwen* edition. Further, the *Taiping Yulan* (745) renders the two characters “came to lodge” as simply “to.” It is likely that “came” is a superfluous interpolation, for “to” and “lodge” share the same meaning. The following line reads, “The arrow lodged in her pupil, yet her eyelids did not blink,” directly continuing this thought—thus the superfluity of “came” is evident. Bo Jun observes: Wang’s argument is not precise. The character “came” should follow the *Shiwen* as “tip.” The arrow’s tip refers to its point. The *Taiping Yulan* (350) cites it as “not yet,” which is a misprint of “tip.” The *Shiwen* reads “arrow’s tip,” noting: “Tip is written in one edition as ‘came.’” *Pupil* is pronounced *mou* (莫侯切). *Orbit* is pronounced *kuang* (匡). *Blink* was originally written as *qi* (), meaning the flickering of the eye, and so below. *Qi* () is pronounced *qia* (且洽切). Ren Dachun states: The *Leipian* gives both *blink* (睫) and *qi* () the pronunciation *she* (失涉切), describing the movement of the eye; thus in one edition, *blink* is also written as *qi* (). The *Records of the Grand Historian*, “Biography of Bian Que,” reads: “Dimly perceiving the flicker.” The *Suoyin* comments: “*Qi* () is *blink* (睫),” providing evidence for the interchangeability of *blink* and *qi*. The *Shiwen* also defines *blink* as the flickering of the eye. Consulting the *Leipian*, “flickering” refers to the rapid opening and closing of the eye. The *Hanfeizi*, “Illustrations of the Laozi,” records: “Hui Zi said to the Lord of Zhou, ‘If someone were to meet you and wink one eye at you, what would you do?’ The Lord replied, ‘I would surely kill him.’ Hui Zi said, ‘A blind man winks both eyes at you—why do you not kill him?’ The Lord said, ‘He cannot help but wink.’” The meaning of *qi* () here may serve as evidence for its definition as “flickering.” The arrow plunged into the earth, yet no dust rose.\n\n[Annotation] The arrow’s momentum was so extreme that, though it struck, it was imperceptible—what is meant by “the tip of a strong crossbow cannot pierce Lu gauze.” The *Shiwen* writes “pierce” as “tear,” noting: *Plunged* is pronounced *zhui* (坠). *Crossbow* is pronounced *nu* (其两切). *Tear* is written in one edition as “pierce.” *Gauze* is pronounced *gao* (古老切).",

      "translated_text": "[Solution]\nWhen the rear of the draw-hook aligns behind the front, every shot is as the first—hence the eye sees them as one. When the socket does not blink, the arrow’s force expires at the eyelash, so no dust stirs on the ground; it does not fall because it strikes the lash. Ziyu’s “seeing them as one” means that from bowstring to target the arrows link unbroken like a single strand; his “hearing the arrow strike the pupil and drop” means the shot does not enter the eye. This interpretation fails to grasp the ultimate principle and wrongly accuses Gongsun Long of sophistry.\n\nYue Zheng Ziyu said: “You are a disciple of Long—how can you not gloss over his gaps?” *Shiwen* notes: *yan* is pronounced *yúqián* (于虔切). “I shall speak of his more glaring errors.”\n\n[Annotation] *You* means “extreme.”\n\nLong deceived the King of Wei, saying: “Intention arises without mind.”\n[Annotation] Mind is quiescent, without thought. If wayward intentions and concerns arise, one loses the root of mind.\n[Solution] What moves in the mind is called intention. The world recognizes intention but does not recognize mind.\n\n“There is pointing, yet it does not reach.”\n[Annotation] To seek arrival through pointing is to rely on the self to rectify things. Relying on the self to rectify things is to fall short of the limit. Only by forgetting what one relies on can both sides attain the mysterious.\nHuizi said: “Pointing does not reach.”\n[Solution] All pointing is not yet arrival. Arrival is without pointing.\n\n“There is thing, yet it is not exhausted.”\n[Annotation] Within the realm of coarse existence, there is always being; at the verge of exhaustion, the One always remains. The One remains undivided, and though one may wish to diminish it, principle does not permit exhaustion. Only by following without diminishing, by conforming without violating, do the towering majesty of Mount Tai and the vast expanse of primordial qi merge indistinctly into one.\nHuizi said: “A one-foot staff, halved each day, will not be exhausted in ten thousand generations.”\n[Solution] If it were exhausted, it would not be being. A one-foot staff, halved each day, will not be exhausted in ten thousand generations because, though divided many times, it becomes minute yet principle does not allow it to be exhausted.\n[Annotation] *Chui* in the Northern Song edition is written as *jìng*; in the Shide Tang edition, as *shén*.\n\n“There is shadow, yet it does not move.”\n[Annotation] Shadow arises from light. If light does not move, shadow is newly generated. All things change imperceptibly, and none is different. The deluded have not awakened, so the analogy of shadow is used.\nHuizi said: “The shadow of a flying bird never moves.”\n[Solution] Movement changes shadow. New shadows follow in succession, so no movement is perceived.\n[Annotation] *Weichang* in Wang’s edition is written as *weiyi*; here corrected according to the Zang edition. The character *bu* in “light does not move” is likely an interpolation.\n*Shiwen* notes: *jie* is pronounced *ziyi* (子亦切).\n\n“A single hair can draw a thousand jun.”\n[Annotation] What causes things to break is always an uneven point. Where every point is even, nothing can break. Thus a hair, though fine, can balance a heavy weight because its force is perfectly even.\n[Solution] Fine as it is, a hair can lift a thousand jun—just as the weight of many hairs can break an axle yet remain light.\nBo Jun notes: The *Mozi Jingxia* states: “Evenness does not break—explanation lies in evenness.”\n\n“A white horse is not a horse.”\n[Annotation] This argument has many debaters. All debaters lack broad understanding, so it is omitted here without discussion.\n[Solution] “White” names color; “horse” names form. “A white horse is not a horse” debates form and color.\n[Annotation] *Jianzai* in the original edition is written as *jiancun*; in the Zang edition, as *jianzai*.\n*Liezi Jishi*, Juan Five, “Tang Wen Di”",

If later people were to claim there are no things now, it would be untenable.\nThe *Lushi Qianji* 2 includes the character *shi* before “later.”\n*Shiwen* states: *Fu* is read as *fuyou*, the same below.\n\nYin Tang said: “Then are there no before and after among things?”\nXia Ge replied: “The end and beginning of things have no ultimate limit. What begins may become an end, and what ends may become a beginning—how can one know their order?\n〔Annotation〕What is now called an end may be the beginning of something; what is called a beginning may be the end of something. End and beginning follow one another in an unbroken cycle, making them ultimately indistinguishable.\nJiang Yougao notes: *Shi*, *yi*, *ji* rhyme, all belonging to the ancient *zhi* rhyme group.\n\nYet beyond things and before events, I do not know.”\n〔Annotation〕Beyond things and before events, there is only vast emptiness, leaving nothing to point to or speak of.\n\n〔Solution〕If later generations must take today as antiquity, how is it different from today’s inquiry into antiquity? How could there be no things? From Tang’s perspective, antiquity lies before, yet the beginning of things and the origin of events alternate in sequence—this cannot be known.\n\nYin Tang asked: “Then do the eight directions above and below have limits or boundaries?”\n〔Annotation〕Though Tang and Ge exchanged answers, their perceptions and hearing remained unclear, so Tang posed this question again to achieve complete clarity.\nWang Shumin notes: The *Shiwen* edition of the annotation has *hua* instead of *jin*; this is likely correct. The *Zhuangzi: Gengsang Chu* chapter’s “those of its ministers who were *huaran*-knowing departed” is the source of these two characters. *Jin* is probably a graphical error for *hua*, or a corruption influenced by the character *jin* in the main text.\n*Shiwen* states: *Chong* is read as *zhuyong*, the same below. *Hua* is pronounced *huo*; one edition has *jin*.\n\nGe replied: “I do not know.”\n〔Annotation〕It is not that he does not know, but that it cannot be known through wisdom.\nTang pressed the question.\nGe said: “If there is nothing, then there is no limit; if there is something, then there is a boundary—how could I know this?\n〔Annotation〕To exhaust the limitless and bound the limited is to reason from the unknown by analogy.\nTao Hongqing notes: The character *you* below “if there is something” should also be *wu*. “If there is something, then there is no boundary” aligns with Gongsun Long’s “there are things that are inexhaustible,” Hui Shi’s “a one-foot stick, halved each day, will never be exhausted in ten thousand generations,” and the Western notion of “the indestructibility of matter.” The following passage, “Beyond the limitless there is no further limitless; within the boundless there is no further boundless,” develops this idea. The current text’s error of *you jin* (“there is a boundary”) contradicts its intent. Zhang’s annotation, as given, clearly refers to the absence of limitlessness and the presence of boundlessness, indicating that his edition correctly read *wu jin* (“there is no boundary”).\n\nYet beyond the limitless there is no further limitless; within the boundless there is no further boundless.\n〔Annotation〕If it is called limitless, how can there be anything beyond it? If it is called boundless, how can there be anything within it? What is called “no limitless” and “no boundless” is truly limitless and boundless.\nThe Northern Song edition of the annotation reads “if it is called emptiness” instead of “if it is called boundless”; Wang’s edition follows this, but the current text adopts the Zang edition’s correction.\n\nBeyond the limitless there is no further limitless; within the boundless there is no further boundless.\n〔Annotation〕Some might suppose that beyond the limitless there is another limitless, or that within the boundless there is another boundless. Therefore, it is reiterated that beyond the limitless there is no further limitless, and within the boundless there is no further boundless.\n\nFrom this I know that it is limitless and boundless, but I do not know that it has limits or boundaries.”\n〔Annotation〕To know the limitless is to know everything; not to know the limited is true knowledge.\n\nTang further asked: “What exists beyond the four seas?”\nWang Chongmin notes: The *Taiping Yulan* 2 includes the character *hu* after “exists.”",

      "translated_text": "Ge said, “It is like the Central State.”\n〔Annotation〕*Qi* means “center.”\n〔Exegesis〕How could the boundless have limits or ends? Thus the Dao pervades all without exception—this is what “nothingness” signifies. Both its essence and function are vast, neither void nor unreal.\n\nBo Jun notes: *Qizhou* refers to the Middle Kingdom. The *King Mu of Zhou* chapter states, “The central region among the four seas is called the Central State,” which serves as evidence. The *Exegesis on the Text* notes: The *Erya* says, “South of the central region, where the sun is overhead, is called Danxue; north of it, where the Dipper is overhead, is called Kongtong.” *Ju* means “distance,” and *qi* means “center.”\n\nTang said, “How do you substantiate this?”\nBo Jun notes: The *Huainanzi*’s *Spirit and Light* chapter states, “The multitude regards it as empty words, but I will cite examples to substantiate it.” Gao You’s commentary explains, “*Shi* means ‘to clarify.’” The *Book of Later Han*’s *Annals of Emperor Shun* records, “The edict ordered the inspectors of You, Bing, and Liang provinces to verify and assess officials from *ershiqian shi* down to those with yellow seals, as well as those who were aged, weak, or unfit for military service.” The commentary explains, “*Shi* means ‘to verify,’” both of which elucidate the meaning of *shi* here.\n\nGe said, “When I traveled east to Ying,\n〔Exegesis on the Text〕Today’s Liucheng was ancient Yingzhou; traveling east to the sea confirms this.\nthe people were the same as here.\n〔Annotation〕Just like this region. If one asks about the lands east of Ying, they are still like Ying.\nWhen I traveled west to Bin,\n〔Exegesis on the Text〕*You* is interchangeable with *Bin*.\nthe people were the same as here. If one asks about the lands west of Bin, they are still like Bin. From this I know that the Four Seas, the Four Wastes, and the Four Poles are no different from this.\n〔Annotation〕The meanings of the Four Seas, Four Wastes, and Four Poles are found in the *Erya*. Knowing they are no different from this region confirms that this is the standard.\n〔Exegesis〕The four directions cannot be exhausted, for all contain birth and death, love and hate, parents and children, wives and sons. Thus, I know that beyond the Four Wastes and Four Poles, it is no different from within Ying and Bin—this is the standard.\n\nWang Chongmin notes: Below “之,” the original text likely included “外,” which is now missing. The previous question by Tang asked, “What exists beyond the four seas?” This is Ge’s answer, so it should read “beyond the Four Seas, Four Wastes, and Four Poles.” The *Taiping Yulan* indeed includes “外” after “之.”\nBo Jun notes: Wang’s argument is sound. Lu Chongxuan’s exegesis also suggests his edition included “外.”\n〔Exegesis on the Text〕The *Erya* states: The Nine Yi, Eight Di, Seven Rong, and Six Man are called the Four Seas. Guzhu, Beihu, Xiwangmu, and Rixia are called the Four Wastes. Dong Taiyuan, Xi Binguo, Nan Pujian, and Bei Zhuli are called the Four Poles. *Jian* is pronounced *xianbian*.\n\nBo Jun notes: In the *Exegesis on the Text*, “Taiyuan” may appear as “Qinyuan,” “Binguo” as “Jiaoguo,” and “Bei Zhuli” as “Ci Zhuli,” all of which are errors.\n\nThus, the great and small contain one another without end. That which contains the myriad things is like that which contains heaven and earth.\n〔Annotation〕What contains the myriad things is heaven and earth; what encompasses heaven and earth is the Great Void.\n〔Exegesis on the Text〕“Great Void” is written as *daxu*; *da* is pronounced *tai*, and the same applies below.\nIt contains the myriad things and thus is inexhaustible.\n〔Annotation〕Heaven and earth contain transformations; yin and yang receive qi. The myriad things flow into form, succeeding one another without ceasing in one life or ending in one form—thus, it is inexhaustible.\nIt contains heaven and earth and thus is without limit.\n〔Annotation〕Heaven and earth enclose the Three Luminaries and embrace the Four Seas—they are vast indeed. Yet as material forms, they must have limits. If one exhausts their limits, how could they not be void? Calculating that heaven and earth exist within the Great Void, they are as if present and as if absent. Thus, all within the realm of bounded space, whether large or small, numerous or few, are relative. Extending this to the ultimate of nothingness, how could it be exhausted by one heaven or bounded by one earth? Then heaven and earth and the myriad things mutually envelop one another, alternating as states and cities. How could one know their fullness or emptiness or measure their totality?\n\nI also how do I know that beyond heaven and earth there are not greater heavens and earths?\n〔Annotation〕The Great Void is boundless, while heaven and earth are limited. Encompassing the limited within the boundless, heaven and earth are not necessarily the greatest of forms. Thus, what Zou Yan spoke of was merely within his grasp.\n〔Annotation〕In the *Shide Tang* edition, “掌” is written as “尝.”\n〔Exegesis on the Text〕*Yan* is pronounced *yuqian*, and the same applies below.\nThis, too, is something I do not know.",

      "translated_text": "Here follows the translation:\n\n---\n\nThe spiritual Dao embraces the myriad things, thus it is inexhaustible; yin and yang embrace heaven and earth, thus they are without limit. Beyond heaven, earth, and the myriad things lies what I cannot discern with reason—this does not mean I know nothing at all.\n\nThe annotation for \"无垠\" originally read \"无限,\" but here it follows the *Shidetang* edition as \"无垠.\" The *Shiwen* notes: \"限\" is rendered as \"垠,\" and states, \"The character '及' in '知及' appears in one version as '反,' which may be a textual error.\" *Huò* is pronounced *hūkuò*. *Yín* is read as *yín* (like \"silver\"), and the same applies below; one version writes it as *xiàn*. *Jū* is pronounced *jū*. *Zhìgù* is pronounced *zhìgǔ*. *Jiě* is pronounced *xiè*. *Kū* is pronounced *kū*. *Kuā* is read *kǒuhuā*. *Dān* is pronounced *tāgān*, the name of Laozi. *Zhōu* is the name of Zhuangzi.\n\nThus, heaven and earth are also things. Since things are insufficient, in ancient times Nüwa smelted the five-colored stones to mend their deficiencies.\n\n**Annotation:** When yin and yang lose their measure, the Three Luminaries expand and contract—this is what causes the deficiencies of heaven and earth, not necessarily a flaw in their physical forms. Nüwa was a divine being, thus she could refine the essence of the Five Constants to harmonize yin and yang, ensuring the solar and stellar degrees followed their proper sequence, without needing to physically patch them with material objects.\n\n**Exegesis:** Zhang Zhan’s annotation here is apt. Qin Enfu notes: \"练\" is the ancient form of \"炼,\" and the *Huainanzi* also writes it as \"练.\" He Xiou remarks: Zhang Zhan’s annotation, interpreting the five-colored stones as an allegory for the Five Constants, is but a clever turn of phrase. The philosophers of the Warring States often intermingled with the novelists, and not all can be scrutinized. Even in the *Liezi*, the tale of the Lord of Longbo fishing for the giant turtle, or the discourse on the transformed man’s robe—what do these parables truly signify? Wang Shumin observes: The *Yiwen Leiju* (6), *Taiping Yulan* (2 and 51) all include the character \"之\" before \"石,\" making the syntax consistent with the following text; this should be adopted. The *Shiwen* states: *Wā* is pronounced *guā*; Nüwa was an ancient sovereign, of the Feng clan.\n\nShe broke the legs of the giant turtle—\n\n**Annotation:** The *ao* is a colossal turtle. The *Shiwen* notes: *Duàn’áo* is pronounced *duàn’áo*, as explained later.\n\n—to establish the Four Pillars. Later, Gonggong contested with Zhuanxu for the throne.\n\n**Editor’s Note:** The *Records of the Three Sovereigns* in the *Shiji* states he fought with Zhu Rong, while the *Huainanzi*’s \"Yuandao\" chapter says he vied with Gaoxin for the throne, and the \"Tianwen\" chapter claims he contended with Zhuanxu—these are all variant traditions from antiquity. The *Shiwen* notes: Gonggong was an ancient emperor, *Gōng* pronounced *gōng*; *Zhuānxū* is pronounced *zhuānxū*.\n\nEnraged, he struck Mount Buzhou—\n\n**Annotation:** Gonggong rose to power between the eras of Fuxi and Shennong. His descendants, relying on their strength, later contested with Zhuanxu for the throne. Zhuanxu was a grandson of the Yellow Emperor. Mount Buzhou lies at the northwestern extreme. Lu Wenchang notes: In the annotation, after \"Zhuanxu,\" the *Zang* edition includes the character \"是,\" and after \"Yellow Emperor,\" the character \"之.\"\n\n—snapping the pillar of heaven and severing the cords of earth. Thus, heaven tilted to the northwest, and the sun, moon, stars, and planets moved there.

Therefore, the sage knows the heavenly Dao diminishes excess to supplement deficiency, so the Three Luminaries and the hundred rivers attain their great essentials. The *Shiwen* notes: *Lǎo* is pronounced *lǎo*.\n\nTang further asked: \"Do things have greatness and smallness? Do they have length and brevity? Do they have sameness and difference?\"",

The *Han Shenyun* of the *Book of Songs* says: \"Flowing east into the bottomless valley.\" Below it lies no bottom.

Wang Chongmin observes: The *Taiping Yulan*, fascicles 60 and 67, both read *Guītáng*, matching the alternate version noted in the *Shiwen*. The *Shiwen* adds: *Guixu* appears in some versions as *Guītáng*.\n\nThe waters of the eight cords and nine fields, the flow of the Celestial Han, all pour into it without increase or decrease. The *Commentary* explains: The eight cords are the eight poles; the nine fields are the eight directions of heaven and its center. Tradition holds that the Milky Way connects with the sea.

The *Exegesis* notes: *chún* is pronounced *chún*; *gǎo* is read as *gǔ-lǎo*.\n\nThe trees of pearl and jade grow in dense clusters. The *Exegesis* notes: *gān* is pronounced *gān*.

Wang Chongmin observes: The *Taiping Imperial Encyclopedia* (vol. 38) omits the second *jiē* (\"all\"), likely a superfluous interpolation.\n\nThe inhabitants are all of the lineage of immortals and sages; those who fly back and forth between them day and night are beyond counting.\n\n**[Annotation]** The distance between two mountains is seventy thousand *li*, and among the five mountains, the total spans two hundred eighty thousand *li*.

Their movements and functions never cease, flitting to and fro in an instant—boundless in number. The Shide Hall edition does not repeat the phrase \"come and go.\" In the line \"cannot be reckoned,\" *bù* (\"not\") is written as *nǎi* (\"thus\") in the Northern Song edition. The *Exegesis* notes: *shù* (\"number\") is pronounced *sè-zhǔ*, and the annotation follows the same reading.\n\nYet the roots of the five mountains have no attachment,\n\n**[Annotation]** Such mountains float upon the sea; by this reasoning, all realms of form are lodged within the great void, thus lacking any root or stem.\n\nLu Wenchang notes: The annotation omits the character *yú* (\"upon\") after *fú* (\"float\") in the Zang edition. The *Exegesis* writes *zhuó* as *zháo*, noting: *zháo* is pronounced *zhí-lüè*.\n\nEver rising and falling with the tides, the *Exegesis* notes: *shàng* (\"rise\") is pronounced *shí-zhǎng*, they cannot pause even for a moment.\n\n**[Exegesis]** The five senses—eye, ear, nose, tongue, and body—drift with the waves and cannot rest even briefly. This illustrates how the world is swept along by sound, form, fragrance, and flavor, ceaselessly entangled, even to the point of forgetting life and scorning death in pursuit of fame and profit. They do not know how to still their thoughts, return to the source, nurture the spirit, and restore the Dao.\n\nThe *Exegesis* writes *zàn* (\"briefly\") as *zǎn*, noting: *zhì* (\"pause\") is pronounced *zhí-lǐ*.\n\nThe immortals and sages found this grievous, the *Exegesis* notes: *dú* means \"to afflict,\" and appealed to the Emperor. The Emperor feared they would drift to the westernmost reaches, losing the abode of the assembled immortals and sages.

The Zang edition has *xiān shèng* (\"immortals and sages\"), while the Sijie and Qin editions read *qún xiān shèng* (\"assembled immortals and sages\").\n\nYu Yue states: The Lu Chongxuan edition reads, \"The Emperor feared they would drift to the westernmost reaches, losing the abode of the assembled immortals and sages,\" which should be followed. The five rooted mountains, having no attachment, would naturally drift to the westernmost reaches—what cause for anger would there be? The error likely arises from the following phrase, \"the Emperor’s wrath.\" Moreover, the term *xiān shèng* (\"immortals and sages\") appears three times in the text, proving that *qún shèng* (\"assembled sages\") here is incorrect. The phrase *xī jí* (\"westernmost reaches\") is also suspect. If the five mountains rise and fall with the waves, how can one be certain they would drift only westward? The subsequent line, \"Mounts Daiyu and Yuanqiao drifted to the northernmost reaches,\" confirms they need not drift solely westward. *Xī jí* (\"westernmost reaches\") should likely be *sì jí* (\"four extremities\").\n\nBo Jun notes: Yu’s argument is sound; the present text follows the Qin and Sijie editions, adding the character *xiān* (\"immortals\").\n\nWang Shumin states: The *Yiwen Leiju* (96), *Taiping Imperial Encyclopedia* (931), and *Shiwen Leiju* (postface, 35) all include the character *shàng* (\"Supreme\") before *dì* (\"Emperor\"). The *Jinxiu Wanhua Gu* (supplement, 5) includes *tiān* (\"Heaven\") before the second *dì* (\"Emperor\"). The present text likely omits *shàng* or *tiān* before both instances of *dì*.\n\nThereupon, he commanded Yuqiang,\n\n**[Annotation]** The *Classic of the Great Wilderness* states: This is the name of the god of the northernmost reaches, whose emissary is the sacred turtle.

      "translated_text": "The five mountains first stood firm and unmoving.\n\n**[Annotation]** For the corporeal form is the dwelling of the numinous spirit. If the five faculties drift and lose their proper governance, then immortals and sages will have no abode. *Zhuangzi* states: \"Once it receives its completed form, it does not perish until its end.\" If the five faculties drift aimlessly, they will follow delusion to death. A life spent in vain—how lamentable! Thus the great sages established methods and teachings to restrain them, and the five faculties thereby found stability. The five dusts correspond to them, the five senses arise from them, hence the term \"fifteen.\" Through the mind they are discerned, hence the term \"three shifts.\" Every sixty thousand years they alternate—from this one understands the Dao of restraining the five faculties.\n\nThe *Tibetan*, *Qin*, and *Shidetang* editions omit the three characters \"and unmoving.\" Wang Chongmin notes: The *Leiju* (96) and *Taiping Yulan* (803, 834) include these three characters, suggesting they were omitted in modern editions. Bo Jun notes: The *Wen Xuan* annotations to Zuo Taichong’s *Wu Du Fu*, Mu Xuanxu’s *Hai Fu*, *Taiping Yulan* (931), and Hong Xingzu’s supplementary commentary to the *Chuci*’s *Heavenly Questions* all include these three characters.\n\nIn the land of the Longbo, there were giants who, in fewer than several steps, reached the location of the five mountains. The *Northern Song* edition reads \"several thousand,\" followed by Wang’s edition; the present text follows the *Tibetan* edition in emending this. Wang Chongmin notes: The *Northern Song* edition writes \"thousand\" for \"steps,\" matching one variant noted in the *Exegesis*. The *Leiju* (96) cites it as \"several tens of steps,\" which may be closer to the original. Likely, the *Northern Song* edition’s \"thousand\" is a corruption of \"ten,\" with the following \"steps\" omitted. Bo Jun notes: The *Taiping Yulan* (931) and *Shiwen Leiju* (Later Collection, 35) both cite it as \"several tens of steps.\" The *Exegesis* notes: *shu* is pronounced *se zhu*; *bu* (\"steps\") in one variant is written as *qian* (\"thousand\").\n\nWith a single hook, they caught six giant turtles.\n\nThe *Exegesis* notes: *diao* (\"hook\") in one variant is written as *he* (\"join\"); *qu* is pronounced *qu* (\"to hasten\").\n\nThey returned to their land and scorched the turtles’ bones to divine by them.\n\n**[Annotation]** A mountain thirty thousand *li* in height and circumference is borne on the head of a single turtle, yet these six turtles were all drawn by a single hook. The people of Longbo could carry them all at once and even bore into their bones to calculate—such a person’s form must have spanned over a million *li*. Compared to them, the *kun* and *peng* are but mosquitoes, midges, fleas, and lice. Then what in the great void could not be contained?\n\n**[Annotation]** *Bo* means \"elder.\" The dragon, bearing the six emotions, seeks its own ease—how much more does it lose its proper governance through the might of its strength! This illustrates how, among the vulgar, desires for sensuality, pride, love, greed, indulgence, and craving stain and drown, yet they further destroy and employ them. Huang Sheng notes: Character dictionaries all define *ao* as a large turtle, but according to this text, *ao* refers to a turtle, not a large soft-shelled turtle. Qin Enfu notes: The commentary following \"pride\" appears to have omissions or errors. Wang Shumin notes: The *Chuxue Ji* (19), *Caotang Shijian* (35), and *Jinxiu Wanhua Gu* (Continuation, 5) all include the character *yin* (\"thereupon\") before *zhuo* (\"scorch\"). The *Exegesis* notes: *zhuo* is pronounced *zhuo*; *shu* is pronounced *su ju*; *suan* means \"to calculate\"; *zuan* is pronounced *xiang guan*; *kunpeng* is pronounced *kun peng*; *wenrui* is pronounced *wen rui*; *zaoshi* is pronounced *zao se*.\n\nThereupon, the two mountains Daiyu and Yuanqiao drifted to the Northern Ultimate and sank into the great sea, displacing countless immortals and sages.\n\n**[Annotation]** What the vulgar heart drowns in is nothing heavier than sensuality and beauty; gentlemen and petty men alike are ensnared by fame and profit—hence it is said the two mountains flowed away. Love and drowning run deep, likened to the great sea. The drifting of spiritual awareness cannot be fully expressed.\n\nThe Lord was enraged.\n\n**[Annotation]** *Ping* means \"great.\" The *Exegesis* writes *ping* as *feng*, noting: *feng* is pronounced *fen*.\n\nHe diminished the land of Longbo and made it narrow. Wang Zhong notes: *E* (\"narrow\") and *ai* (\"constricted\") are interchangeable, a shift in pronunciation. The *Exegesis* writes *qin* (\"diminish\") as *jin*, noting: *jin* is pronounced *zi jin*, with one variant as *qin*; *e* is pronounced *wu mai*.\n\nRen Dachun notes: The *Records of the Grand Historian* (\"Annals of Emperor Wu\") states: \"It encroached upon Mount Tai.\" The *Suoyin* commentary says: \"*Qin xun* means *jin*.\" The *Huainanzi* (\"Interpretation of Words\") states: \"At the beginning of yin and yang, all is harmonious and alike; as days lengthen their kind, they gradually encroach and grow distant\"—meaning they begin alike but gradually diverge. The *Shiming* states: \"When the eye’s flesh grows into the pupil, it is called *jin*; *jin* means *qin*. It also says *jin* means to gradually enlarge,\" thus *qin* and *jin* are interchangeable.\n\nHe shrank the people of Longbo to make them short. By the time of Fuxi and Shennong, the people of that land were still tens of *zhang* tall.\n\n**[Annotation]** The *Shan Hai Jing* states: Beyond the Eastern Sea, in the great wilderness, there is a land of giants. The *Hetu Yuban* states: Nine hundred thousand *li* north of Kunlun lies the land of Longbo, where people are forty *zhang* tall and live eighteen thousand years before dying.\n\n**[Annotation]** The great sages detested the harm caused by desires and thus established laws to restrain them.

      "translated_text": "The \"Huainanzi\" in its \"Dropping Form\" chapter states: \"To the southwest lies the land of the Jiao Yao.\" Wei Zhao’s commentary in the *Lu Yu* notes: \"Jiao Yao is another name for the southwestern barbarians.\" Thus, in antiquity, some placed the Jiao Yao in the southwest. The *Taiping Yulan* (790), citing the *Map of Foreign Lands*, records: \"The Jiao Yao lie thirty thousand *li* from Jiuyi,\" which would place them in the south. The *Exegesis*, quoting the *Comprehensive Geography*, states: \"They are north of Da Qin.\" Since Da Qin lies in the southwest, this would place them in the west. Reconciling these accounts, the southwest is the most balanced location. Those who place them in the west or south likely differ only slightly in perspective. Yet no source places them in the east, confirming that \"east\" is indeed a scribal error. This passage records the extraordinary beings of the four directions: the Ming Ling of Jing’s south, the Kun and Peng of the northern wastes, the Zheng People of the northeast, and the Jiao Yao of the west. If \"east\" were correct, it would redundantly overlap with the Zheng People. Thus, \"east\" is a miswritten character, providing further evidence.\n\nThe *Taiping Yulan* (378 and 790) both write \"four\" as \"three.\" It is likely that the original text of the *Liezi* read: \"From the Central States, thirty thousand *li* to the west lies the land of the Jiao Yao.\" Later, the character \"west\" was mistakenly written as \"four,\" leading to the erroneous insertion of \"east\" and the deletion of \"three.\"\n\nThe *Exegesis* notes: \"Jiao Yao is pronounced *Qiao Yao*; it is the name of a land of short people.\" The *Records of the Grand Historian* states: \"The people of Jiao Yao are three *chi* tall, the shortest of all.\" Wei Zhao says: \"Jiao Yao is another name for the southwestern barbarians.\" According to the *Comprehensive Geography*, they lie northwest of Da Qin, and their people are one *chi* and five *cun* tall.\n\n**[Annotation]** This account appears in the *Poems Containing the Spirit’s Mist*.\n\nThe *Exegesis* notes: \"Seen\" is pronounced *xian* (rising tone), as below.\n\nAt the northeastern extreme live people called the Zheng People, nine *cun* tall.\n\n**[Annotation]** See the *Classic of Mountains and Seas*.\n\nThe *Poems Containing the Spirit’s Mist* states: \"At the northeastern extreme dwell such people.\" Having described the large, it proceeds to clarify the small. Qin Enfu notes: The *Classic of Mountains and Seas* writes \"Zheng\" as \"Jing.\" Wang Chongmin says: The *Taiping Yulan* (378) writes \"Zheng\" as \"Jing,\" which should be read as \"Jing.\" The *Shuowen* states: \"Jing: in one sense, it means 'minute.'\" The *Classic of Mountains and Seas: Great Wilderness East* says: \"Beyond the Eastern Sea, in the midst of the great wilderness, lies the land of the Small People, called the Jing People.\" Guo Pu’s commentary notes: \"Jing is sometimes written as Jing.\" The *Exegesis* notes: \"Zheng\" is pronounced *zheng* (rising tone). The *Classic of Mountains and Seas* states: \"Beyond the Eastern Sea dwell small people called the Zheng People.\"\n\nSouth of Jing lies the Ming Ling.\n\nThe *Exegesis* notes: \"Ming Ling is the name of a tree. It grows south of the Yangtze, marking spring by the sprouting of its leaves and autumn by their fall. It takes five hundred years as its spring and five hundred years as its autumn.\"\n\nIn high antiquity, there was the Great Chuen.\n\nThe *Exegesis* notes: \"Chuen is pronounced *chun* (rising tone); it is the name of a tree, also called by this name. It takes eight thousand years as its spring and eight thousand years as its autumn.\"\n\nUpon rotting soil grow fungi and zhi.\n\nWang Chongmin notes: The *Taiping Yulan* (945) writes \"upon\" as \"soil.\"\n\nThe *Exegesis* notes: \"Fungi\" is pronounced *jun* (falling tone). Cui Zhuan says: \"Zhi grow upon dung. They sprout at dawn and die by dusk.\" The *Jian Wen* states: \"They suddenly sprout as zhi, living from dawn until dusk.\"\n\nIn the months of spring and summer, there are meng and rui.\n\nWang Shumin notes: The *Cloudy Satchel* (90) writes \"in the months of spring and summer\" as \"in the clear sky.\"\n\nThe *Taiping Yulan* (945), the *Guangyun* (Upper Tone, 3), and the *Yunfu Qunyu* (9) all write \"meng rui\" as \"mie meng.\"\n\nThe *Exegesis* notes: \"Meng\" is pronounced *meng* (falling tone). \"Rui\" is pronounced *rui* (falling tone), referring to the tiny flying insects known as mie meng, mosquitoes, and rui. These two are small flying creatures that arise with rain and perish upon exposure to sunlight.\n\n**[Exegesis]** If one’s desires cause them to lose their true nature, then what difference is there between the gigantic and the minuscule, the long-lived and the short-lived? Thus, we know that from the highest immortals to the lowliest ants, those who stray from the true and lose the Dao, driven by their passions and desires, suffer the same loss.\n\nNorth of the farthest north—\n\n**[Annotation]** The *Zhuangzi* says \"the barren north.\"\n\nThe Zang and Shide Tang editions write: \"North of the farthest hairy north.\" Wang Zhong says: The *Zhuangzi* says \"barren north\" (*qiong fa*); *zhong* is a variant of *qiong*. Yu Yue says: The *Exegesis* notes that one edition omits the character \"hairy,\" and this should be followed. \"Farthest north\" is the name of a land. Below, it states: \"When Yu governed the waters and earth, he became lost and strayed into a land by the northern sea’s edge, a land called Farthest North.\" Thus, \"north of the farthest north\" means north of that land. The present insertion of \"hairy\" likely stems from later scholars adding it based on the *Zhuangzi*’s *Free and Easy Wandering*. They failed to realize that while the *Zhuangzi* speaks of \"north of the barren north,\" this text speaks of \"north of the farthest north,\" and the two are not the same. If one were to add it here, then saying both \"north of the farthest hairy north\" and \"north of it\" would be redundant.\n\nThe *Exegesis* writes \"north of the farthest hairy north,\" noting: One edition writes \"north of the farthest north.\"\n\n—lies the Dark Sea.\n\nThe *Exegesis* notes: The *Record of the Ten Continents* states: \"The Dark Sea is a celestial pool whose waters are black.\"\n\nThere is a fish there, thousands of *li* in breadth,\n\nThe *Exegesis* notes: \"Breadth\" is pronounced *guang* (falling tone), and \"thousands\" is pronounced *shu* (falling tone).\n\nand its length matches its breadth.\n\nBo Jun notes: The *Artificers’ Record: Wheelwright* says \"it is called *can chen*,\" with the commentary: \"*Chen* means 'equal.'\" Here, \"matches\" should be read with a departing tone.\n\nThe *Exegesis* notes: \"Matches\" is pronounced *chen* (falling tone), as below.\n\nIts name is Kun.\n\nThe *Exegesis* notes: \"Kun\" refers to the whale.\n\nThere is also a bird there, named Peng.\n\nThe *Exegesis* notes: \"Peng\" is pronounced *peng* (rising tone).",

The *Essential Techniques for the Common People* (vol. 10) cites it as \"its jade-green tree remains green in winter,\" though it erroneously includes an extra \"bears\" (*sheng*), the \"green\" (*qing*) remains correct. The *Lei Ju* (vol. 87, mistakenly cited as \"Lie Zhuan\" instead of *Liezi*) and the *Imperial Digest* (vol. 973) both correctly cite it as \"remains green in winter.\" \"Jade-green tree, green in winter\" and \"cinnabar fruit, sour in taste\" form a parallel structure.

      "translated_text": "Wang Shumin states: The *Jizuan Yuanhai* (vol. 92) also cites it as \"green.\" Consuming its bark and juice cures qi-induced ailments. Xu Weiyu notes: Lüshi Chunqiu’s *Utmost Loyalty* commentary glosses \"已\" as \"to heal.\" Wang Shumin adds: \"厥\" is a loan for \"瘚.\" The *Shuowen* defines \"瘚\" as \"reversed qi.\" The *Exegesis* reads: \"愤\" is pronounced *fèn* (房吻切). \"愤厥之疾\" refers to qi disorders.\n\nThe tree is prized in Qi; crossing the Huai northward, it transforms into the *zhi*. The *Exegesis* notes: The *Zhouli* states, \"The orange crosses the Huai north and becomes the *zhi*.\" The myna does not cross the Ji River. The *Exegesis* reads: \"Ji\" is pronounced *jǐ* (子礼切); \"鸲鹆\" is pronounced *qúyù* (瞿浴). The *he* dies upon crossing the Wen. The *Exegesis* reads: \"貉\" is pronounced *hè* (鹤), resembling a fox, a sleep-loving beast; \"汶\" is pronounced *wén* (武巾切). Li Daoyuan’s *Shui Jing* states: The Ji River rises in Mount Wangwu as the Dui (pronounced *yǎn*) River, flows east through Wen to become the Ji, enters the Yellow River after ten *li*, then southward across the river to form Yingze, passing through nine commanderies including Jiyin before reaching the sea. The *Zhouli* states: \"The myna does not cross the Ji; the *he* dies upon crossing the Wen—this is due to the land’s qi.\" Zheng Xuan notes: The Wen River lies north of Lu’s capital. Earlier scholars, following one another, mistakenly assumed this referred to Lu’s Wen River. However, according to the *Records of the Grand Historian*, \"汶\" and \"\" share the pronunciation *wén* (武巾切), denoting the Min River, not the *wèn*-pronounced Wen. The *Shan Hai Jing* states: The Great River issues from Mount Min. Guo Pu comments: It flows southeast through Shu Commandery, northeast through Badong and Jiangxia, then enters the sea at Guangling. The *Han Shi Waizhuan* states: \"Of old, the Jiang River rose in Mount Min; at its source, it was but a cup’s depth.\" The *Chu Ci* also reads: \"Hidden in the clear Jiang of Mount Min.\" This is conclusive. Moreover, the *Liezi* and *Zhouli* both speak of the differing natures of water and soil, such that relocation causes harm. Thus, the Four Rivers are cited as examples.\n\nNow, Lu’s Wen River spans no more than a few dozen paces, its source no more than two hundred *li*. One could wade across it in moments—how could a fox or *he*, briefly crossing, face life and death so abruptly? The *Shuowen* states: \"The *he* is a fox-like creature.\" All thrive on hills and dry land. Today, people along the Jiang say foxes do not cross the river. Clearly, crossing great waters harms their nature, even unto death. This is the land’s qi at work.\n\n[Note] This principle is also found in the *Zhouguan*. The Qin edition reads: \"This is the land’s qi at work.\"\n\nNevertheless, though their forms and qi differ, their natures are equal. Wang Shumin states: The *Exegesis* reads, \"One edition adds '情' (emotion), rendering it '情性钧已' (emotions and natures are equal).\" This is correct. \"Emotions and natures are equal\" parallels the earlier \"forms and qi differ.\" The *Exegesis* notes: All punctuate at \"已.\" One edition reads: \"Emotions and natures are equal.\" They do not exchange with one another. All beings are whole; all parts are sufficient. The *Exegesis* reads: \"分\" is pronounced *fèn* (符问切).\n\n\"How can I discern their greatness or smallness? How can I know their length or brevity? How can I recognize their sameness or difference?\"\n\n[Note] Myriad beings, myriad forms, myriad natures, myriad emotions—each rests in its proper place, none failing to fulfill its role. Thus, their natures are equal and whole, with no desire for exchange. How could wisdom distinguish them?\n\n[Exegesis] What is born of yin and yang, suited to the land, touched by spiritual qi, or altered by habit—all are thus. What need is there to debate it?\n\nThe Taihang and Wangwu Mountains—\n\n[Note] \"形\" should be \"行.\" Taihang lies in Heyang County, Henan; Wangwu in Dongyuan County, Hedong. Wang Chongmin states: The *Taiping Yulan* (vol. 40) cites \"行\" for \"形,\" likely amended by the compiler. The *Exegesis* reads \"太形\" as \"大形,\" glossing it as *tàxíng* (泰行), with the same note. \"垣\" is pronounced *yuán* (袁).\n\n—span seven hundred *li* and rise ten thousand *ren*. Originally situated south of Jizhou and north of Heyang. The Foolish Old Man of North Mountain,\n\n[Note] The common term \"foolish\" does not necessarily imply lack of wisdom.\n\naged nearly ninety, lived facing the mountains. Harassed by the mountains’ northern blockade and the circuitousness of his comings and goings,\n\n[Exegesis] \"形\" is pronounced *xíng* (户刚反). \"惩\" means caution, trauma, or governance. The *Exegesis* notes: The *Han Shi Waizhuan* glosses \"惩\" as \"suffering.\" \"迂\" is pronounced *yū* (于), as below.\n\nhe gathered his household to deliberate: \"I propose we unite our strength to level the perilous terrain, opening a path south to Yuzhou and reaching the northern bank of the Han River. Is this feasible?\" They all assented.\n\n[Note] \"杂\" means \"all.\" The *Exegesis* reads: \"杂\" is pronounced *zá* (七合切), as below; \"佥\" is pronounced *qiān* (七廉切).\n\nHis wife raised a doubt,\n\n[Note] \"献疑\" means to pose a challenge. The *Exegesis* reads: \"难\" is pronounced *nàn* (乃旦切).\n\nsaying: \"With your strength, you cannot even reduce the mound of Kuifu. What can you do to the Taihang and Wangwu?\n\n[Note] Kuifu is a small hill in Chenliu. The *Taiping Yulan* cites the *Huainanzi*: \"A puddle from an ox’s hoof holds no carp a foot long; the hill of Kuifu yields no timber for a hut—both are too narrow to contain greatness.\" The *Yiwen Leiju* (Mountains section) cites the *Huainanzi* with \"魁父\" as \"□府.\" The original text reads \"魁阜,\" differing in character but identical in sound. The *Exegesis* reads: \"曾\" is pronounced *céng* (层), as below. The *Huainanzi* writes \"魁阜,\" meaning a small hill like a mound.\n\nWhere will you dispose of the earth and rocks?\" They replied: \"Dump them into the tail of the Bohai Sea, north of Yintu.\"\n\n[Note] The *Huainanzi* states: \"The northeasternmost land is called Yintu.\"",

The nine-tiered tower rises from heaped earth, and the lofty bank in time becomes a hidden gorge. If effort is never abandoned, not confined to morn or eve, then nothing is too minute to accumulate, and nothing too vast to diminish. Now whetstone and blade, grinding without end, show that both will be worn away. If these two things are so, then hills and valleys waxing and waning leave no room for doubt.

Such are the short-sighted concerns of the common man, the ordinary sentiments of a single generation. But the great person takes heaven and earth as a single morning, a hundred million ages as a fleeting instant; forgetful of self in pursuing the task, effortless in achieving the work; whether here or there, in oneself or in others, perceives no difference, knows no before or after.

But those who attain the highest learning must seek the Dao, forgetful of life, to unite with the real. Hearing the Way, they put it into practice, regardless of age; exhausting life without awaiting divine response, or moved to spontaneous enlightenment.

      "translated_text": "Alas! *Chī* is pronounced *chì zhī qiè*. *Yǔ* is pronounced *yú*.\n\nKuafu overestimated his strength. Bo Jun notes: The *Lüshi Chunqiu*’s \"Seeking the Worthy\" chapter states, “The wilds of Kuafu.” Gao You’s commentary says, “Kuafu is the name of a beast.” Guo Pu’s commentary on the *Classic of Mountains and Seas: The Classic of the Northern Wilderness Beyond the Sea* states, “Kuafu was likely the name of a divine being.” The *Huainanzi*’s \"Treatise on Terrain\" says, “Kuafu’s ears lie to its north (the character *qǔ* follows Wang Niansun’s emendation). Kuafu discarded his staff, and it became Deng Forest.” Gao You’s commentary: “Kuafu was a divine beast. *Dèng* means ‘wood.’ Another saying: a transcendent.” The *Shiwen* states: *Kuā* is pronounced *kǒu huā qiè*. *Fù* is pronounced *fǔ*. The *Classic of the Great Wilderness* says: “There was a man who wore two yellow serpents as earrings and grasped two yellow serpents, named Kuafu. He wished to pursue the sun’s shadow and chased it to the edge of Yu Valley.” [Annotation] Yu Valley is Yuyuan, where the sun sets. Thirsty and desiring drink, he rushed to drink from the Yellow and Wei Rivers. The Yellow and Wei Rivers were insufficient, so he set off north to drink from the Great Marsh. Before arriving, he died of thirst on the way. He cast aside his staff, and where his corpse’s fat and flesh soaked the ground, Deng Forest grew. The *Shiwen* states: *Jìn* is pronounced *zǐ jìn qiè*. Deng Forest spread vast, spanning thousands of *li*. [Annotation] The *Classic of Mountains and Seas* says, “Kuafu died, discarded his staff, and it became Deng Forest.” [Exegesis] When a person wholly devotes himself to seeking the Dao, he departs from existence to unite with the real. But if one relies on ability to seek victory, he chases shadows yet never catches them. When he unites with the real, form is entirely leveled; when he pursues the superficial, he loses his life and leaves traces. The manifestation of traces gives rise to Deng Forest; the union with the real levels mounds and ridges.\n\nWang Shumin says: The *Cao Tang Shi Jian Bu Yi*, *Ji Zuan Yuan Hai*, and *Shi Wen Lei Ju* all omit the two characters “Deng Forest,” which may be superfluous.\n\nYu the Great said: “Within the Six Directions and the Four Seas, all is illuminated by the sun and moon, ordered by the stars, regulated by the four seasons, and governed by Jupiter. Bo Jun notes: Jupiter is the planet Jupiter. Jupiter’s orbital period is 11.86 years; the ancients mistakenly believed it to be twelve years. Thus, they divided the zodiac into twelve stations, through which it passed once each year, hence ‘governed by Jupiter.’ *Yào* means ‘to bind.’” The *Shiwen* reads “Jupiter” as “Great Year,” stating: *Yào* is pronounced *yī yáo qiè*. *Dà* is pronounced *tài*. “Spirits and numina give birth to things of strange forms. Some die young, some live long—only the sage can comprehend their Way.” [Annotation] The sage follows the Dao of Heaven and Earth, accords with the natures of the myriad things, allows them to follow their courses, and comprehends their reversals and sequences, enabling all differences to attain their proper places. Both long and short lives fulfill their allotted spans. Bi Yuan says: *Liezi* directly cites the *Classic of Mountains and Seas: The Classic of the Southern Wilderness Beyond the Sea*. Lu Wenchang says: In the *Daoist Canon* edition, the annotation includes a “de” character after “all.” Wang Shumin says: The *Essentials of Government* quotes the annotation as “comprehends their reversals,” corresponding to the above “allows them to follow their courses.”\n\nXia Ge said: “Yet there are also those who are born without awaiting spirits and numina, take form without awaiting yin and yang, shine without awaiting the sun and moon, [Annotation] Those who are born do so of themselves; those who take form do so of themselves; those who shine do so of themselves. Suddenly, spontaneously, they are thus—inherently without reliance or borrowing. die young without awaiting slaughter, live long without awaiting nurture, [Annotation] Those who die young do so not through calamity; those who live long do so not through care. eat without awaiting the five grains, clothe themselves without awaiting silk and floss,” The *Shiwen* states: *Zēng* is pronounced *sì líng qiè*. *Kuàng* is pronounced *kuàng*. “travel without awaiting boats and carriages,” The *Shiwen* states: *Chē* is pronounced *jū*. “Their Way is spontaneous, [Annotation] The spontaneous is entirely without reliance. not something the sage can comprehend.” [Annotation] The sage does not oppose the spontaneous, and the myriad things move of themselves. How could he delight in comprehending things? All the above from this chapter is what Xia Ge told Tang of Yin. [Exegesis] The moving forms of things each have their proper place; the sage can accord with their arising to comprehend their Way. Yet the numinous consciousness is supremely subtle, requiring nothing, not dependent on the nurturing of the multitude of existents. It moves alone, spontaneously—how could the sage comprehend it?\n\nThe annotation “above” in the *Daoist Canon* edition reads “the above.”\n\nWhen Yu governed the waters and lands, he became lost and strayed from his path, erring in one state. [Annotation] One who roams beyond the farthest bounds is beyond the reach of deliberate thought, hence the metaphor of being lost and erring. Lu Wenchang says: The annotation’s “also” in the *Daoist Canon* edition reads “only.” He reached the north of the Northern Sea, not knowing how many thousands or tens of thousands of *li* distant from the Central States. [Annotation] *Jù* means “distance.” Lu Wenchang says: The annotation’s “distance” in the *Daoist Canon* edition reads “to.” The state was named Zhongbei. [Exegesis] Zhongbei means its utmost seclusion and subtlety, the land of profound stillness. No one knows where its boundaries align, The *Shiwen* states: *Qí* is pronounced *zǐ xì qiè*. without wind, rain, frost, or dew, and no birds, beasts, insects, fish, grasses, or trees are born there. All four directions are level, encircled by towering ridges. [Annotation] The layered ranges of mountains. [Exegesis] The land of profound stillness has no boundaries; wind, rain, birds, and beasts—the movements of the multitude—do not reach it. Within it, all is utterly level. Towering ridges are the obstructions of form. Wang Chongmin says: The annotation’s “layered ranges” should read “layered folds,” a scribal error. The *Erya*’s “Explaining Mountains” says, “A mountain with three folds is called *zhì*.”",

Here, \"returned to his former state\" means resuming his usual ways—consuming wine and meat, summoning consorts and attendants.

Why heed Xi Peng’s words?\" Zhang’s commentary: That land is simply unattainable—would we desist merely because of Peng’s words?\n\n[Exegesis] What Xi Peng understood did not extend to this. Guan Zhong said: From what I have heard, I only fear it may not be as the legends claim. Thus, he said he feared it was \"unknowable.\" If what is examined matches the legends, and one could go and reach it, then why cling to the worldly allure of sensuality and wealth? Why heed rites, virtue, loyalty, or goodness?\n\nThe people of the southern lands shave their heads and go naked. Zhang’s commentary: *luǒ*, pronounced as *lì guǒ*.

Kong Anguo’s commentary on the *Shangshu* states: *Zhù* means to sever the hair. The *Hanshu* states: The people of Yue cut their hair and tattoo their bodies to avoid harm from dragons.

      "translated_text": "□, pronounced as *wáng bā*. *Qiāo*, pronounced as *qī xiāo*. The people of the Central States wear caps and robes. The resources of the Nine Lands vary: some till the soil, some trade, some hunt, some fish; like winter furs and summer linen, boats for water and carts for land. They attain these naturally, forming them by instinct.\n\nThe annotation states: The resources of each region arise from natural ability. Thus, the people of Wu and Yue use boats, while those of Yan and Shu ride horses, adapting to the suitability of water and land without needing instruction from the wise. Shen Dao said: \"Those who control water use thatch to block and dredge, and though they dwell among the Yi and Mo, their methods are as uniform as one. They learn from water itself, not from Yu.\"\n\nThe *Shiwen* notes: *cí*, pronounced as *jí yí*. *Mò* is pronounced as *mò*. To the east of Yue lies the state of Zhémù. In the Northern Song edition, \"Zhé\" is written as □, which Wang’s edition follows, though no such character exists in dictionaries. Here, it is corrected following the Zang edition. The Shide Tang edition writes \"mù\" as \"mù,\" and the annotation \"xiū\" as \"kāng.\" Qin Enfu said: *Mozi* writes it as \"□mù,\" *Taiping Guangji* as \"kǎi mù,\" and *Xinlun* as \"zhěn mù.\" Yang Bojun notes: *Bowuzhi* writes it as \"hài mù.\" The *Shiwen* writes \"mù\" as \"xiū,\" stating: *Zhé* in the *Shuowen* is written as *yì*, pronounced *zhū shè*, meaning pendulous ears. *Xiū* means beauty, likely referring to those with dangling ears. Other texts writing it as □mù are in error.\n\nWhen their eldest son is born, they butcher and eat him. Lu Wenchang said: \"Xiān\" should be understood as flaying. *Mozi*’s *Lu Wen* chapter writes \"xiān ér shí zhī,\" matching *Liezi*, while its *Jie Zang* chapter writes \"jiě ér shí zhī,\" showing that *xiān* and *jiě* are the same. The *Liji*’s *Yue Ling* states: \"In late summer, if spring ordinances are followed, grain will be *xiān luò*,\" while *Lüshi Chunqiu* writes it as \"*jiě luò*,\" further proof. He also said: *Xiān* and *xī* are phonetic shifts, so \"*xī zhī*\" is also written as \"*xiān zhī*,\" and *Mozi* likewise uses *xiān*. Wang Zhong said: *Xiān* means to split, a phonetic shift. Zhongfu said: *Xiān* should be glossed as *xī* (to split). *Lüshi Chunqiu*’s *Bao Geng* chapter states: \"Zhao Meng saw a starving man under a mulberry tree and gave him a piece of dried meat, saying, '*Sī* shí zhī.'\" The meaning of \"*xiān ér shí zhī*\" is identical to \"*sī shí zhī*,\" as *sī* and *xiān* share both sound and meaning in antiquity. Wang Chongmin said: *Xiān* has no meaning of flaying; Lu’s interpretation is incorrect. *Xiān* is likely a corruption of *jiě*. In vulgar script, *jiě* may be written with *yáng* as 解, and characters with *yú* are prone to corruption into those with *jiǎo*. In *Shiji*’s *Biography of Jia Yi*, \"*xì gù jiè jì xī*\" is corrupted into \"*xì gù □ jì xī*.\" The *Jing Jun Inscription* of the Han reads \"*yuán yuán guān guǎ*,\" with *guān* corrupted into □. The *Er Ya*’s *Shi Shan* states: \"Small mountains are *bié*, large mountains are *xiān*.\" The *Shiwen* notes: \"*Xiān* may also be written as □.\" Li Shan’s commentary on *Wen Xuan*’s *Wu Du Fu* cites the *Er Ya* as writing it *xiè*. *Zhuangzi*’s *Ren Jian Shi* reads: \"*cuò zhēn zhì xiè*,\" with the *Shiwen* noting: \"Cui’s edition writes it □.\" All are evidence of the interchange between *xiān* and *jiě*. Thus, *Mozi*’s *Lu Wen* writing *xiān* and *Jie Zang* writing *jiě* shows the former is corrupted. *Yue Ling* writing *xiān* and *Lüshi Chunqiu* writing *jiě* (as does *Huainanzi*’s *Shi Ze* chapter: \"*gǔ shí jiě luò*\") shows *Yue Ling* is also corrupted. *Liezi*’s use of *xiān* follows the same pattern. Lu’s attempt to reconcile them is thus mistaken.\n\nYang Bojun notes: Wang’s argument follows Sun Yirang’s *Mozi Jian Gu*’s citation of Gu Jun’s theory, but *xiān* is inherently intelligible and need not be emended. *Bowuzhi* writes it as \"*jiě ér shí zhī*.\"\n\nThe *Shiwen* notes: *zhǎng*, pronounced as *dīng zhàng*. Du Yu’s commentary on the *Zuozhuan* states: Those who do not die of old age are called *xiān*, meaning young. Yang Bojun notes: Du Yu’s commentary on *Zuozhuan*’s *Zhao Gong Wu Nian* (\"those buried young exit through the West Gate\") states: \"Those who do not die of old age are called *xiān*.\" Kong Yingda’s *Zhengyi* glosses it as \"young,\" which is the basis for Jing Shun’s note, though he does not clarify it further.

Lu Wenchang notes: In the *Mozi*’s *Jiezang* chapter, \"炎\" is written as \"啖.\" Sun Yirang states: The *Luwen* chapter also writes \"啖人,\" as does the *Xinlun*; the *Bowuzhi* cites it as \"炎,\" and the *Hou Hanshu* likewise writes \"啖人国.\" It is likely that \"啖\" is correct. The *Shiwen* writes \"炎人\" as \"啖人,\" noting: *啖* is pronounced with a departing tone, originally written as *炎.*\n\nWhen their kin die—Qian Daxin notes: The ancients referred to parents as *kin*; the *Da Dai Liji*’s *Zengzi Jibing* chapter states: \"When kin have passed, though one wishes to be filial, to whom can one be filial?\" The *Mengzi*’s *Jinxin* chapter reads: \"Nothing is greater for a person than the loss of kin, ruler, minister, superior, or inferior\"—they carve away the flesh and discard it. The Shide Tang edition omits the character \"之\" after \"弃.\" The *Shiwen* notes: *□* is originally written as *呙*, pronounced *guǎ*, meaning to strip flesh. It is also pronounced *xiǔ.* Wang Chongmin states: The *Shiwen*’s alternate version writes *呙*, likely a corruption of *呙.* The *Shuowen*’s *呙* section reads: \"*呙*: to strip flesh from a person and set aside the bones,\" which is its meaning. Yang Bojun notes: The *Bowuzhi* also writes \"朽其肉而弃之,\" and the *Taiping Yulan* (790) cites \"刳\" for \"朽,\" likely following the *Liezi.* Only after burying the bones is one deemed a filial son.\n\nThe *Shiwen* notes: *乃* is the ancient form of *乃.*\n\nWest of Qin lies the state of the *Yiqu*—also called *Kang.* The *Shiwen* notes: *渠* is pronounced *qú.*\n\nWhen their kin die, they gather brushwood and pile it to burn them. The *Zang* edition and the Shide Tang edition write \"祡\" as \"柴.\" The *Shiwen* notes: *祡* is pronounced *chái.* The *Shuowen* reads: \"To burn brushwood and offer it as sacrifice to the celestial spirits.\" It is sometimes interchangeable with *柴.* *积* is pronounced *zì*, meaning to gather. Ren Dachun states: The *Shiwen* on the *Shijing*’s *Shimai* chapter notes: \"*Cháiwàng*: the *Shuowen* and *Zilin* write it as *祡*.\" The *Shiwen* on the *Liji*’s *Wangzhi* chapter reads: \"*Dàizōng chái*: following the character, it is written as *祡*.\" The *Shiwen* on the *Erya*’s *Shitian* chapter states: \"*Chái*: the *Shuowen* writes it as *祡*.\" The *Shiji*’s *Five Emperors* chapter reads: \"*Dàizōng chái*.\" The *Han Li Ziyuan*’s *Fan Yi Xiu Hua Yue Bei* writes \"柴\" as \"祡,\" which can be mutually verified with the *Shiwen.*\n\nWhen the smoke rises, it is called *ascending to the distant.* Tao Hongqing states: Having already said *gather*, to say *pile* is redundant. *积* should be a loan for *箦.* The *Shijing*’s *Weifeng* reads: \"Green bamboo like *箦*,\" with the *Mao* commentary: \"accumulated.\" *箦* and *积* share sound and meaning, and by example may be used interchangeably. The *Shuowen* reads: \"*箦*: bed matting.\" Zhu Junsheng takes *箦* as a general term for woven mats. The *Shiji*’s *Fan Sui Liezhuan* reads: \"Fan Sui feigned death, then was rolled in *箦*.\" The *Suoyin* notes: \"*箦* refers to thin reeds.\" \"Gathering brushwood and *箦* to burn them\" means piling brushwood as a mat to facilitate burning. \"When the smoke rises, it is called *ascending to the distant*\" means that when one sees the smoke rising, it is called *ascending to the distant.* *则* is equivalent to *而*; for details, see Wang’s *Jingzhuan Shi Ci.* Wang Shumin states: In the *Liezi*, *登遐* is written as *升霞* in the *Xinlun*, with *升* correctly written as *升* (ascend). *登* is thus *升.* *登霞* means they have become immortals. *遐* is a loan for *霞.* In this book’s *Huangdi* chapter, \"而帝登假,\" *假* is also a loan for *霞.* The *Huainanzi*’s *Qisu* chapter reads: \"Those who cannot ride clouds and *ascend to the distant* are clearly incapable.\" \"*Ascend to the distant*\" is paired with \"*ride clouds*,\" showing that \"*ascend to the distant*\" is \"*登霞*.\" The *Chuci*’s *Yuanyou* reads: \"Carrying my spirit and *ascending to the distant*,\" using the original character. Only then is one deemed a filial son.\n\nThis is taken as governance above and custom below, yet it is not considered strange.\n\n[Note] This matter is also recorded in the *Mozi.*\n\n[Explanation] What the multitude deems right becomes correct; what they practice becomes customary. Thus, the most correct and most common things go unquestioned. Those who follow custom are many—how would they know the ultimate principle? Yang Bojun notes: This passage in the *Liezi* is identical to the *Bowuzhi.* The current *Bowuzhi* is certainly not Zhang Hua’s original work, but since the *Liezi* was forged between the late Western Jin and early Eastern Jin, it may have plagiarized the *Bowuzhi.*\n\nConfucius traveled east and saw two children arguing.

      "translated_text": "When the sun first rises, its light does not yet reach far, and those standing beyond its glow perceive it as large. When the sun is at its zenith, its light suffuses all things, and those within its glow perceive its true form. This is like gazing at a candle’s flame from afar—it appears larger; yet when viewed up close, the flame seems smaller. Such is the principle of things—what benefit is there in debating it?\n\nWang Chongmin notes: The *Leiju*, *Chuxue Ji*, and *Taiping Yulan* all quote this passage with *wei* (為) written as *wei* (謂). The two characters were interchangeable in ancient script.\n\nBo Jun’s note: On August 15, 1955, the *Guangming Daily*’s Science Supplement published an article by Dai Wensai titled *\"Is the Sun Closer to Us at Noon Than in the Morning or Evening?\"*, appended here in full:\n\n*\"Is the sun closer to us at noon or in the morning and evening? Legend holds that Confucius once encountered two people debating this, each with their own reasoning. Those who argued the sun was closer at noon cited the greater heat of midday sunlight, while those who claimed it was closer in the morning and evening pointed to its larger apparent size then. Confucius could not settle the dispute. From a modern scientific perspective, neither argument holds. The sun’s larger appearance at dawn and dusk is an optical illusion, while the greater heat at noon results from direct sunlight traveling a shorter path through the atmosphere, with less heat absorbed. So how should we answer this question? First, we must clarify why the sun’s distance appears to vary between noon and morning or evening. Several factors contribute:\n1. The Earth is spherical and rotates continuously. If it had no other motion and its axis were perpendicular to the line between the Earth and the sun, observers at the equator would always find the sun closer at noon—by a distance equal to Earth’s radius (6,400 km).\n2. Observers are not necessarily at the equator. The greater the latitude (the farther from the equator), the smaller the difference in the sun’s distance between noon and morning or evening.\n3. The Earth not only rotates but also revolves around the sun, with its rotational axis tilted 23.5 degrees relative to its orbital axis. The direction of this axis changes very slowly, causing the sun’s midday height in the sky to vary throughout the year.\n4. The Earth’s orbit is elliptical, so the distance between the Earth’s center and the sun’s center changes daily.\n5. Sunrise and sunset times vary throughout the year, and on the same day, they differ by latitude.\n6. Due to the slow shift in the Earth’s rotational axis and the gravitational influence of other planets on its orbit, the date when the Earth and sun are closest is not fixed. Currently, this occurs on January 2, though it shifts 17.5 days later every 1,000 years.\n\nConsidering these factors, we can derive formulas to calculate the difference in the sun’s distance from an observer at noon versus morning or evening. The necessary data can be found in astronomical almanacs. The results are as follows: For a latitude of 40° north (e.g., Beijing), the sun is currently farther at noon than at sunrise from January 22 to June 5 each year—by 1,000 km in early February, 4,000 km in early March, and up to 6,400 km in early April, after which the difference diminishes to zero. After June 5, the sun is closer at noon than at sunrise—by 5,800 km in early July and up to 16,000 km by mid-September, before the difference again decreases until the following January 22. The difference between noon and evening is quite different: from August 1 to December 15, the sun is farther at noon than at evening, while for the remaining seven and a half months, it is closer—by up to 17,000 km in mid-April. Outside the Arctic and Antarctic Circles, the year can be divided into four periods:\n1. From December 15 to January 22 (38 days), the sun is closer at noon than in the morning or evening.\n2. From January 23 to June 4 (134 days), the sun is farther at noon than in the morning but closer than in the evening.\n3. From June 5 to August 1 (57 days), the sun is again closer at noon than in the morning or evening.\n4. From August 2 to December 14 (136 days), the sun is closer at noon than in the morning but farther than in the evening.\"*",

      "translated_text": "Thus, all phenomena must be explained through science to be correct.\n\n**Additional Note:** The *Lunheng* in its \"Discourse on the Sun\" states: \"Some Confucians claim that the sun is nearer at dawn and dusk when it rises and sets, and farther at noon. Those who argue that the sun is nearer at sunrise and sunset and farther at noon do so because the sun appears larger at those times and smaller at noon. Others contend that the sun is farther at sunrise and sunset and nearer at noon because it feels warmer at noon and colder at dawn and dusk. Both arguments have their merits and flaws, leaving no definitive resolution to the matter.\" This may have been the source for the spurious *Liezi*. The current edition of the *Bowuzhi* also records this, adding that \"it is also found in the *Liezi*,\" which aligns with the *Siku Quanshu* *Bowuzhi* précis' observation that it was compiled by meddlers who pieced together passages from the *Liezi* and other texts.\n\nAnother annotation cites the phrase *\"Beyond the six directions, the sage preserves but does not discuss\"*—the line *\"Beyond the six directions\"* appears in the *Zhuangzi*'s \"Discourse on Equalizing Things.\" *\"Equality is the supreme principle under heaven.\"* [Annotation:] When all things and affairs are balanced and equal, the principle is perfectly realized. This applies even to physical objects. [Annotation:] *\"Connected\"* means attached. Even objects must be balanced. The *Shiwen* notes: *\"Connected\"* is read as *zhu* (音烛), with the same pronunciation below.\n\n*\"When hair is evenly suspended and evenly weighted, it snaps due to imbalance—unevenness causes it to break.\"* [Annotation:] Hair is extremely fine and fragile, yet it does not break when perfectly balanced. The reason it snaps now is because, like weights tilting unevenly, there is imbalance. Wang Shumin remarks: The second *\"hair\"* character is likely a superfluous repetition from the line above. Lin Xiyi’s *Kouyi* reads: *\"Thus it is said, ‘It snaps due to imbalance—unevenness causes it to break,’\"* suggesting his edition lacked the second *\"hair\"* character. The *Mozi*'s *Canons and Explanations (B)* mirrors this.\n\n*\"If it is balanced, it does not break.\"* [Annotation:] If it were truly balanced, how could it break? *\"It does not break.\"* [Annotation:] It means it does not snap. *\"People deem this incorrect,\"* [Annotation:] Ordinary people do not grasp the principle. *\"Yet there are those who know it to be so.\"* [Annotation:] There are those who understand this principle as true. The *Mozi* also contains this argument.\n\n[Exegesis:] The ultimate principle is that nothing under heaven is unequal; it is not that things become equal only after being balanced. The same applies to physical objects—when aligned with principle, they are naturally balanced. It is like suspending a weight with a hair: though delicate, it does not break. Snapping occurs due to imbalance; balance ensures it does not break. The world dismisses this as untrue, unaware that it is the necessary nature of principle.\n\nZhan He [Annotation:] Zhan He, a man of Chu, was renowned in his state for his skill in fishing. He used a single silkworm’s thread as his line. The *Shiwen* notes: *\"Zhan\"* is read as *Zhan* (音占); *\"cocoon\"* is read as *jian* (古典切). He fashioned a needle of *mang* grass into a hook. Wang Niansun states: *\"Hook\"* originally read *\"fishing\"* (钓), as *\"fishing\"* is synonymous with *\"hook.\"* Modern editions read *\"hook\"* (钩) because later scholars, knowing only that *\"diao\"* (钓) means *\"to fish,\"* were unaware it also serves as an alternate name for *\"hook\"* (钩), thus altering it arbitrarily. The *Liezi*'s \"Tang Wen\" chapter states: *\"Zhan He used a needle of *mang* grass as his hook,\"* but later editors changed *\"fishing\"* (钓) to *\"hook\"* (钩), unaware that the *Taiping Yulan* cites this passage with *\"fishing\"* (钓). Further, in the line *\"casting the line and sinking the hook\"* below, modern editions read *\"hook\"* (钩) instead of *\"fishing\"* (钓), another alteration by later hands. The *Yunfu Qunyu* under the entry for *\"fishing\"* (钓) cites the *Liezi*'s *\"casting the line and sinking the hook,\"* indicating that earlier editions still read *\"fishing\"* (钓). The *Shiwen* notes: *\"Mang needle\"* is read as *wang zhen* (音亡箴). He used a *jing* bamboo as his rod. [Annotation:] The *Daozang*, Yuan, and Shide Tang editions read *\"you\"* (莜) in error. The *Shiwen* notes: *\"Jing\"* is also written as *\"you\"* (莜), originally a *\"tiao\"* (条) character. He split grains for bait.

Casting the line and sinking the hook, my hand moves with neither lightness nor heaviness—nothing can disturb it. The fish see my hook and bait as mere sinking dust or gathered foam, swallowing them without hesitation. *[Wang Chongmin notes: The Jifu edition has both instances of \"hook\" (钩) written as \"angling\" (钓), which is correct. \"Angling\" here refers to the hook. Modern editions use \"hook\" because later readers knew only that \"angling\" meant fishing, unaware that it was also an alternate name for \"hook,\" thus altering it arbitrarily. The *Guangya* states: \"Angling is the hook.\" The *Zhuangzi*'s \"Tian Zifang\" chapter reads: \"King Wen observed at Zang and saw an old man angling, yet his angling was no angling—he did not hold his angling as angling, for it was constant angling.\" (Of these six instances of \"angling,\" only the two in \"his angling\" and \"hold his angling\" refer to the hook; the other four are read as the verb \"to angle.\") The *Huainanzi*'s \"Shuoshan\" chapter states: \"Wielding a hook, he ascends the mountain; raising an axe, he enters the abyss.\" The \"Shuolin\" chapter says: \"A hook without bait cannot catch fish.\" Dongfang Shuo’s \"Qi Jian\" reads: \"To use a straight needle as a hook—what fish could be caught?\" All serve as evidence that \"hook\" was written as \"angling.\" The *Yunfu Qunyu* under the entry for \"angling\" cites the *Liezi*: \"Casting the line and sinking the hook,\" showing that the edition it consulted still used \"angling.\" For further discussion, see Wang Niansun’s *Dushu Zazhi Yubian*. (Wang states: \"Zhan He used a needle as his hook; later scholars changed 'angling' to 'hook,' unaware that the *Taiping Yulan* also writes it as 'angling.'\" Note: The Bao edition of the *Taiping Yulan* (834) writes it as \"hook,\" but the original reading as \"angling\" is still preferable.) *[The *Shiwen* notes: *\"Mo\"* (沫) is read *mo* (音末).]*\n\nThus can the weak overcome the strong, and the light attain the heavy. If Your Majesty governs the state with such focus, the realm could be turned as if in the palm of your hand—what further effort would be needed?\"\n\nThe King of Chu said, \"Excellent.\" *[Note: He approved of this analogy, using it to admonish the king’s governance of the state.]*\n\n*[Explanation:] When the sage governs the people, he must first examine the nature of all things and establish teachings to guide them. Then the common folk follow daily without awareness, responding effortlessly. Just as a tiny bait, carried by the current, cannot but be controlled by me—so too does the Daoist nurture life and preserve authenticity, like a supple bow and fine line riding the wind to launch. When the light and living beings incline toward transformation, governing the world follows this same Dao.*\n\nGonghu of Lu and Zhao Qiying of Qi both suffered from illness. *[Bo Jun’s note: The *Gongyang Zhuan* for the thirty-first year of Duke Zhao mentions a Gonghuzi, a senior clansman of Zhu Lou—possibly the same Gonghuzi as in the *Shuo Yuan*’s \"Jian Ben\" chapter. This account is certainly fantastical, though the names may have some basis.] *[The *Shiwen* notes: *\"Hu\"* (扈) is read *hu* (音户).]* Together they sought Bian Que for treatment. *[Yu Yue notes: The text says both \"sought\" and \"requested,\" which is redundant. \"Requested\" is a corruption of \"visited.\" \"Visited\" means \"to go to\"—they went to Bian Que’s place to seek treatment. The following line reads, \"The two declined and returned,\" supporting this.] *[Wang Shumin notes: Yu Yue’s interpretation is incorrect. \"Requested\" here means \"to pay respects.\" The *Shuowen* states: \"To request is to pay respects,\" which fits the context.] *[Bo Jun’s note: The *Taiping Yulan* (376) writes \"requested\" as \"visited,\" but (724) retains \"requested.\"] *[The *Shiwen* notes: *\"Bian\"* (扁) is read *biandian*.]* The *Records of the Grand Historian* states: \"Bian Que was a man of Bohai Commandery, surnamed Qin, given name Yue-ren.

      "translated_text": "The *Lüshi Chunqiu*'s \"Benwei\" chapter closely aligns with the *Liezi*, for the *Liezi* borrows from the \"Benwei\" text. During King Mu of Zhou’s western expedition, he crossed the Kunlun Mountains but did not reach Yan Mountain. Wang Chongmin notes: The character \"不\" (*not*) is likely an interpolation. The *Mu Tianzi Zhuan* states: \"The Son of Heaven then drove onward, ascending Yan Mountain.\" The \"King Mu of Zhou\" chapter also records: \"He then (should read *westward*, as previously noted) observed where the sun sets,\" likewise referring to the ascent of Yan Mountain. Thus, King Mu did indeed reach Yan Mountain. If the character \"不\" were present, it would contradict the facts. The *Shiwen* glosses: *Yan* is pronounced *yan*. Yan Mountain is where the sun enters.\n\nUpon his return, before reaching the Central States, a craftsman named Yanshi was presented along the way. (Note: Along the way, a state offered this master artisan.) Bo Jun notes: According to Zhang’s commentary, the original text should read: \"Upon his return, before reaching [the Central States], a state along the way presented a craftsman named Yanshi.\" In the current text, the characters \"国\" (*state*) and \"道\" (*way*) are mistakenly reversed, leading to the erroneous punctuation of \"before reaching the Central States\" as a complete phrase. Though the meaning remains coherent, the original authenticity is lost.\n\nKing Mu received him. (Note: *Received* should read *presented*. The *Shiwen* glosses: *Jian* (*received*) is pronounced *jin* (*presented*) in the *Guangya*, and the same applies below.) The king asked: \"What skills do you possess?\" Yanshi replied: \"I await only your command to demonstrate. However, I have already created something and wish for Your Majesty to see it first.\" The king said: \"Come another day, (Note: *Day* refers to another day.) and we shall observe it together.\" (Exegesis: The marvel of its function extends beyond sound alone. Color, fragrance, and flavor all attain their principles. Thus, this chapter speaks of carving that exhausts the subtlest details.)\n\nThe next day, Yanshi had an audience with the king. (\"The next day\" in the Yuan edition and the Shidetang edition both read \"the following day\"; the *Taiping Yulan* [752] cites it as \"the next day.\" The *Shiwen* notes: *Yueri* (*the next day*) in one version reads *yiri* (*the following day*). *See* is pronounced *xiàn* below.) The king received him and asked: \"Who is the person who came with you?\" He replied: \"It is an entertainer I have created.\" (Note: *Chang* refers to actors and jesters. The *Shiwen* glosses: *Chang* is pronounced *chāng*. *Pai* is pronounced *bāi*.)\n\nKing Mu gazed at it in astonishment. It walked briskly, bowed, and raised its head—truly human in appearance. (The *Shiwen* glosses: *Qu* is pronounced *qū*.) When the skilled craftsman nodded its chin, it sang in perfect harmony with the pitch. (The *Daozang* Four-Exegesis edition reads \"顉\" as \"颔.\" The *Daozang* unannotated edition, Lin Xiyi’s edition, and Jiang Yu’s edition all read \"镇,\" which is likely a corrupted form of \"顉.\" Wang Chongmin notes: The *Wenxuan* commentary on Guo Pu’s \"Youxian\" poem and the *Taiping Yulan* [752] both cite \"顉\" as \"颔.\" The characters *顉* and *颔* are similar in form and meaning, and since later readers were more familiar with *颔* and less with *顉*, those who wrote *颔* were all later emendations. The *Zuozhuan* of the twenty-sixth year of Duke Xiang states: \"Those who greeted at the gate merely nodded their chins,\" while the *Shuowen* cites it as \"顉.\" The *Hanshu* \"Biography of Yang Xiong\" reads: \"nodding the chin and furrowing the brow,\" and Song Qi notes: \"*颔* in one version reads *顉*.\" The *Shuowen* defines: \"*顉*: to lower the head.\" The *Yupian* defines: \"*顉*: to bend the chin.\" Ancient language used *曲* (*bend*) for *钦* (*to admire*), and *低* (*low*, should read *氐* [*root*]) and *曲* both imply a swaying motion. *顉* is glossed as \"lowering the head,\" and *顉颐* as \"bending the chin.\" Since *顉* is derived from *页* (*head*), its meaning adapts to the context. *顉* is the correct character; *颔* is an error. The *Shiwen* glosses: *Fu* is pronounced *fú*. *顉* is pronounced *qū*, meaning \"to bend the chin,\" and also *wǔgǎn* in another reading, meaning \"to shake the head.\" *颐* is pronounced *yí*.) When he raised its hands, it danced in perfect rhythm. With a thousand transformations and ten thousand changes, it followed every intention.\n\nThe king took it for a real person and, together with Sheng Ji, his favored concubine, observed it closely. (Note: The *Mu Tianzi Zhuan* states: Sheng Ji was King Mu’s beloved consort. Bo Jun notes: The *Jinshu* \"Biography of Shu Xi\" mentions that among the miscellaneous texts from the Ji Tomb, one of the nineteen chapters records the death of King Mu’s beloved consort, Sheng Ji.)\n\nAs the performance neared its end, the entertainer winked at the king’s attendants and concubines. The king grew furious and immediately sought to execute Yanshi. Terrified, Yanshi (The *Shiwen* glosses: *She* is pronounced *rèshè*.) promptly disassembled the entertainer to show the king. It was entirely composed of joined leather, wood, glue, lacquer, white, black, red, and blue pigments. (The *Shiwen* glosses: *Fu* is pronounced *fù*.)\n\nThe king examined it carefully. (The *Shiwen* glosses: *Di* is pronounced *dūjì*. *Liao* is pronounced *lìdiào*.) Inside were the liver, gallbladder, heart, lungs, spleen, kidneys, intestines, and stomach. (The *Shiwen* glosses: *Gan* is pronounced *gān*. *Dan* is pronounced *dǎngǎn*. *Fei* is pronounced *fāngfèi*. *Pi* is pronounced *pí*. *Shen* is pronounced in the falling tone.) Outside were sinews, bones, limbs, joints, skin, hair, teeth, and hair. (The *Shiwen* glosses: *Jin* is pronounced *jīn*.) All were artificial yet perfectly complete. When reassembled, it appeared as it had initially. (Note: As it had when first presented to the king. Bo Jun notes: The character \"见\" (*see*) is a superfluous interpolation from the commentary. The note explains \"如初\" (*as initially*) with \"如向者之始见王\" (*as when first seen by the king*), but the main text does not read \"初见\" (*first seen*). The *Taiping Yulan* [752] omits the character \"见,\" and it should be deleted accordingly. The *Shiwen* glosses: *Fu* is pronounced *fúyòu*, and also as in the original text.)\n\nThe king tested it by removing its heart, and its mouth could not speak. He removed its liver, and its eyes could not see. He removed its kidneys, and its feet could not walk. (Note: All these functions were controlled by mechanisms. Removing the master mechanism rendered them inoperative.)",

      "translated_text": "Just as when the five viscera in a person are afflicted with illness, the seven orifices and four limbs all manifest corresponding symptoms externally.\n\n[Exegesis] Now, the internal organs—liver, gallbladder, heart, and lungs—enable external functions such as seeing, hearing, and walking, for it is the spirit that animates them, thus giving life to the creature. If devoid of spirit, the five senses cannot be employed. How then does the creation of living things by the forces of transformation differ from the automaton crafted by Yan Shi? Were it without spirit, it would be no different from grass or wood. But if spirit is present, what is so extraordinary about its movement and function? The wooden figure operates by Yan Shi’s spirit, and thus it rightfully resembles a living creature. How far removed is the craftsman’s skill from the ultimate workings of transformation?\n\nAt this, King Mu was at last delighted and sighed, saying, “Can human ingenuity truly rival the work of the Creator in its achievement?”\n\nHe then commanded his secondary chariot to bear the automaton back to his palace.\n\n[Annotation] In recent times, some have claimed that human vitality arises from mechanical contrivances. Why so? The work of creation is supremely subtle, and thus all things are nurtured, moving without fixed pattern. Human artistry is crude, merely shaping form from inert matter. Yet when craft reaches its utmost, it nearly approaches the work of creation. This idea may have given rise to such theories, though this text itself does not endorse them. The purpose here is to clarify that when skill attains its utmost, thought transcends conventional bounds, and thus examples of extreme craft are adduced to dispel common delusions—how could one ever claim that things lack a spiritual master? Such a view is far from the truth.\n\n[Annotation] The *Shide Tang* edition omits the character *zhe* (者) in “而生者.” The character *ji* (几) is written as *ji* (机), and *xie* (邪) as *ye* (也). Lu Wenchang notes that the two characters “巧极” are inverted in the annotation.\n\n[Exegesis] The cloud ladder of Ban Shu and the flying kite of Mo Di were both deemed the pinnacle of their abilities.\n\n[Annotation] Ban Shu constructed a cloud ladder for scaling heights and attacking from below. Mozi fashioned a wooden kite that flew for three days without landing.\n\n[Bo Jun’s note] The *Mozi*, in the *Lu Wen* chapter, states: “Gongshuzi carved bamboo and wood into a *□*, which, once completed, flew for three days without descending.” The *Huainanzi*, in the *Qi Su Xun*, records: “Luban and Mozi made wooden kites that flew for three days without landing.” The *Han Feizi*, in the *Wai Chu Shuo*, says: “Mozi crafted a wooden kite, taking three years to complete it, yet it flew for only a day before failing.” The *Lunheng*, in the *Ru Zeng* chapter, states: “Confucian texts praise the skill of Luban and Mozi, who carved wooden kites that flew for three days without landing.” The same is repeated in the *Luan Long* chapter. The *Baopuzi*, in the *Ying Chao* chapter, says: “Mozi carved a wooden rooster to soar into the heavens.” Some attribute this to Luban, others to Mozi, and some to both; some call it a kite, others a *□*, and still others a rooster—variations in transmission for the same event.\n\nWhen Dongmen Jia and Qin Guli, disciples of Mo Di, heard of Yan Shi’s craft and reported it to the two masters,\n\n[Sun Yirang’s note] Dongmen Jia was likely a disciple of Ban Shu, hence the phrase “reported it to the two masters.” Some suggest he was also a disciple of Mozi, but this is incorrect.\n\n[Exegesis] the two masters never again dared to speak of their arts and henceforth held fast to their compass and square.\n\n[Annotation] “Held fast to their compass and square” means they dared not boast of their skills.\n\n[Exegesis] For Yan Shi’s work was of such subtlety that his spirit merged with the work of creation, whereas the likes of Ban Shu merely exhausted their skill in mechanical contrivances. This illustrates that the most wondrous achievements cannot be confined to mere rule and measure.\n\nThe *Jifu* edition includes the character *yan* (焉) after *ju* (矩).\n\nWu Kaisheng remarks: “Held fast to their compass and square” signifies diligent study.\n\n[Bo Jun’s note] The *Quan Jin Wen*, in volume 50, records the *Biography of Master Ma* by Fu Xuan: “Later, someone presented a hundred entertainments, which could be set up but not animated.

When placed upon level ground and secretly activated by water, it produced female musicians and dancing figures. Thereupon, the wooden figures beat drums and blew flutes, formed mountains and peaks, and made the wooden men juggle balls and toss swords, climbing ropes and standing upside-down. They moved in and out freely, performed official duties, operated pestles and mills, and staged cockfights—transforming their artistry in a hundred ways.\n\nThus it is evident that skilled artisans already existed in the Wei dynasty.\n\n[Exegesis] *Shuo* is pronounced *shuo*.\n\nGan Ying was an ancient master archer. [Bo Jun’s note] The *Lüshi Chunqiu*, in its “Ting Yan” chapter, states: “Feng Men first learned archery from Gan Ying.” Gao You’s commentary notes: “Gan Ying was presumably the name of an archer.”\n\nHe drew his bow, and beasts prostrated themselves while birds descended. [Annotation] His arrows never missed, so beasts and birds dared not flee. The *Strategies of the Warring States* records: “Geng Lei loosed an empty shot, and a bird fell.” The Daoist Canon’s annotation reads “birds and beasts” instead of “beasts and birds.”\n\n[Bo Jun’s note] The *Bowu Zhi* also records the tales of Gan Ying, Fei Wei, and Geng Lei shooting without an arrow to bring down birds, evidently drawing from the *Strategies of the Warring States*.\n\n[Exegesis] *Gou* is pronounced *gou*, meaning to draw a bow. *Geng* is pronounced *geng*. *Ying* is pronounced *ying*.\n\nHis disciple, named Fei Wei, studied archery under Gan Ying and surpassed his master in skill.\n\n[Wang Shumin’s note] The *Shilei Fu* (chapter 13) and the *Taiping Yulan* (volume 350) both cite the *Liezi* as saying: “Fei Wei learned archery from Gan Ying and mastered all techniques except the *nie* method. Wei secretly carried arrows to shoot at Ying. Ying bit the arrowhead and shot it back at Wei. Wei ran around a tree, and the arrow followed him in circles.” This passage is absent from the current text. It is unclear whether this is a lost fragment of the present section; I record it here for further consideration.\n\nJi Chang, in turn, studied archery under Fei Wei. Fei Wei said: “First learn not to blink, and only then may we speak of archery.” Ji Chang returned home and lay beneath his wife’s loom, gazing upward at the treadle. [Annotation] The *qian ting* refers to the loom’s treadle.\n\n[Wang Shaolan’s note] *Ting* should be the character *□*, a scribal error (□ was corrupted to *jie*, which was further corrupted to *ting*.

      "translated_text": "With the *□* referring to the treadle, beneath the loom hang two boards suspended by cords, which the feet press to raise and lower the warp threads for weaving—this is called the *qian□*. The treadle moves up and down more swiftly than the eye can blink, so Ji Chang practiced not blinking by lying beneath the loom and gazing at it. After two years, he no longer blinked.\n\nXu Lian’s explanation is the same.\n\nWang Chongmin notes: The *Taiping Yulan* (745 and 852) both render *wo* (“lying”) as *zuo* (“sitting”). The *Shiwen* states: *Ting* is read *tu ding* cut. *Nie* is read *nü zhe* cut.\n\nAfter two years, even when a needle’s tip was turned toward his eye’s corner, he did not blink.\n\nWang Chongmin notes: The *Taiping Yulan* (745) renders *er nian* (“two years”) as *san nian* (“three years”), and *dao* (“turned”) as *dao* (“reached”). The same text in volume 825 also renders it as *dao* (“reached”), suggesting that *dao* (“reached”) is correct.\n\nThe *Shiwen* states: *Zhui* is read *zhui*. *Dao* is read *du dao* cut. *Zi* is read *zai yi* cut.\n\nHe reported this to Fei Wei. Fei Wei said: “Not yet.\n\n[Explanation] To shoot birds from a drawn bow is the subtlety of skill; to surpass one’s master is to attain the divine. Subtlety lies in practice, while the divine resides in precision. First learning not to blink is the height of precision. Gazing at the treadle without moving the eyes is the stabilization of spirit. Yet though stabilized, it remains unusable—hence, it is still not enough. You must next learn to see.”\n\n[Explanation] This means applying the unblinking gaze to vision.\n\nThe *Daozang* white-text edition, Lin Xiyi’s edition, Yuan edition, and Shidetang edition all render *bi xue* (“must learn”) as *ya xue* (“next learn”). The *Shiwen* renders *bi* as *ya*, reading *wu jia* cut, meaning “next.” One variant reads *bi xue* (“must learn”), which is incorrect.\n\n“See the small as large, the faint as distinct, and only then tell me.”\n\n[Explanation] *Shi* (“see”) means to scrutinize, so that the small appears large.\n\nJi Chang suspended a louse from the window with a yak’s hair and faced south to observe it. The *Shiwen* renders *shi* (“louse”) as *shi*, reading *mao* for *mao* and *suo yi* cut for *shi*.\n\nWithin ten days, it gradually grew larger. After three years, it appeared as large as a cartwheel. Gazing at other objects, they all seemed like hills and mountains.\n\n[Annotation] Seeing the louse as a wheel, other things proportionally appeared that large.\n\nThe *Shiwen* states: *Chen* is read *chi zheng* cut.\n\nThen, using a bow of Yan horn and an arrow shaft of northern *peng*, he shot it.\n\nWang Guoguo notes: The *Yijing* states: “Bend wood into a bow, sharpen wood into an arrow; the utility of bow and arrow is to overawe the world.” The *Zhouli Kaogongji* states: “The bowyer selects six materials for bow-making, each gathered in its proper season. The stave ensures distance; the horn ensures speed; the sinew ensures penetration; the glue ensures harmony; the silk ensures strength; the lacquer ensures resistance to frost and dew. In selecting the stave, there are seven grades: *zhe* is best, followed by *yi*, then mulberry, then orange, then quince, then *jing*, with bamboo as the lowest.” Thus, bows are made with wood as the stave, reinforced with horn, sinew, glue, silk, and lacquer for binding. A bow is never made of horn alone—it merely supplements the wood. In ancient times, simplicity prevailed, so the first bows were simply strung wood. By the Zhou, ritual and music flourished, and bows were crafted by combining horn, sinew, glue, silk, and lacquer. The *Hanshu Wuxingzhi* states: “The *hu* is the bow.” The *Liji* states: “Mulberry bow and *peng* arrows.” All these refer to wooden bows. Yet the *Liezi* states: “He then shot it with a bow of Yan horn and an arrow shaft of northern *peng*,” implying the bow was made of horn. Thus, bows could be made of wood or horn, with no fixed rule.\n\nJiao Jun notes: The character *shuo* (“northern”) should be *jing* (“*jing* wood”), a graphic error due to similarity. The *Kaogongji* states: “Yan’s horn and Jing’s wood are the finest materials,” which is the source of this passage. Moreover, *jing* is paired with *yan* (“Yan”), suggesting it does not generically refer to the northern regions. The *Taiping Yulan* (347, 745, and 951) all repeat this error.\n\nThe *Shiwen* states: *Yan* is read *yan*. *Hu* is read *hu*. *Gan* is read *gan*. *She* is read *shi yi* cut.\n\nThe arrow pierced the louse’s heart, yet the louse remained suspended without falling.\n\n[Annotation] Using a strong bow and a stiff arrow to pierce the louse’s heart demonstrates the mastery of his hand.\n\nThe *Shiwen* renders *qiang* (“strong”) as *qiang*, reading *qiang qi liang* cut.\n\nHe reported this to Fei Wei. Fei Wei leapt up, striking his chest, and said:\n\nJiao Jun notes: The *Shuowen* defines *ying* as “chest.”\n\nThe *Shiwen* states: *Fu ying* is read *fu ying*.\n\n“You have attained it!”\n\n[Explanation] Seeing the small as large, piercing it was no longer difficult.\n\nAfter Ji Chang had mastered all of Fei Wei’s techniques, he calculated that only one person in the world could rival him. He then plotted to kill Fei Wei.\n\n[Explanation] He sought to surpass his master’s skill, aspiring to exceed his teachings—not to end his life but to erase his reputation.\n\nThey met in the wild.\n\nWang Shumin notes: The *Shiwen Leiju* (42), *He bi shilei* (57), and *Tianzhong ji* (41) all include “one day” before “met,” which should be followed.\n\nThe two exchanged shots. Midway, their arrowheads clashed and fell to the ground,\n\nThe *Shiwen* states: *Feng* is read *feng*. One variant renders *zhui* (“fell”) as *dui*.\n\nand the dust did not rise.",

Judging from Zhan’s commentary, the error already existed in the Jin dynasty). The *Shuowen Jiezi* defines *□* as “the footrest beneath a loom.”",

As it flew, Fei Wei intercepted it with the tip of a thorn, without the slightest deviation.\n\n[Explanation] The two arrows, following the same path and reaching the end of their force, fell to the ground without stirring the dust—so minute was their impact. That he could intercept with a thorn without error shows the utmost precision.\n\nThereupon, the two men wept and cast aside their bows, bowing to each other on the road and pledging to become father and son. They cut their arms to swear an oath,\n\n[Exegesis] *Huainanzi* states: “In the Central States, they smear blood on the mouth; among the Yue people, they cut the arm—both are the same.” Xu Shen explains: “To *ke bi* is to draw blood from the arm.”\n\nand vowed never to teach their art to others.\n\n[Annotation] To keep their Way secret.\n\nThis chapter’s principles and examples are already detailed in the “Zhongni” section.\n\n[Explanation] This is what is meant by “spiritual communion and mutual understanding”—not merely the art of archery. Thus, they cast aside their bows and swore an oath. Only after their spirits had truly connected could the transmission occur, and so they could not impart their art to others.\n\nThe teacher of Zaofu was named Taidou.\n\n[Annotation] Taidou appears in various miscellaneous records.\n\n[Collation] *Lüshi Chunqiu*’s “Ting Yan” chapter states: “Zaofu first studied under Da Dou.” Gao You’s commentary: “Da Dou was likely the name of a charioteer.” *Da Dou* is the same as *Taidou*.\n\n[Exegesis] *Zao* is pronounced *qi dao*; *fu* is pronounced *fu*.\n\nWhen Zaofu first began learning charioteering, he observed the rites with great humility, yet Taidou did not instruct him for three years.\n\n[Collation] *Yiwen Leiju* (746) includes the character *shi* (“Master”) after *Taidou*, and the same below.\n\nZaofu’s observance of the rites grew even more reverent, until Taidou finally told him: “An ancient poem says: ‘The son of a master bowyer must first learn to make a winnowing basket; the son of a master smith must first learn to make a fur coat.’”\n\n[Annotation] Both winnowing baskets and fur coats require bending and joining materials before they become useful implements. For bowyers and smiths, harmonizing sinew and horn or blending metal and iron follows the same principle. Thus, a student must first master what is easy before achieving what is difficult—this is the analogy.\n\n[Explanation] The winnowing basket is the tool used to craft a bow; the fur coat is the tool used to fan the forge. Laozi likened it to a bellows, which today would be called a bag. The one shapes the bow’s frame, the other fans the fire—though neither is the bow or the forge itself, both are indispensable to their making.\n\n[Collation] *Liji*’s “Xue Ji” states: “The son of a master smith must first learn to make a fur coat; the son of a master bowyer must first learn to make a winnowing basket.” Another note: In the *Shide Tang* edition, the annotation’s *yu* (“analogy”) is written as *lun* (“discourse”).\n\n[Exegesis] *Yi* is pronounced *yi chi*.\n\n“First observe my movements.\n\n[Annotation] *Qu* means “movement.”\n\n[Exegesis] *Qu* is pronounced *qu*; the same below.\n\nWhen your movements match mine, then you may grasp the six reins,\n\n[Exegesis] *Pei* is pronounced *bi*.\n\nand the six horses may be driven.”\n\nZaofu replied: “I will follow your command.”",

      "translated_text": "Within, harmony is found at the center of the heart, while without, it aligns with the horse’s will—thus one can advance and retreat as if treading a plumb line, and turn in curves as if compass-drawn. Tao Hongqing says: The character *ju* (矩, \"square\") is superfluous. The original text reads: *\"Advance and retreat in accord with the plumb line, and turn in curves in accord with the compass,\"* meaning *\"straight movements follow the plumb line, curved movements follow the compass.\"* The *Huainanzi’s* \"Treatise on the Dao of Rulership\" quotes this passage without the character *ju*. Wang Chongmin says: Tao’s view is correct. The *Zhuangzi’s* \"Attaining Life\" chapter states: *\"Dongye Bi was presented to Duke Zhuang for his driving skill; his advance and retreat followed the plumb line, and his left and right turns followed the compass,\"* identical in meaning to this passage from the *Liezi* but without the character *ju*, which serves as proof. For *\"treading the plumb line\"* and *\"following the compass\"* form a parallel structure; if *ju* were included, not only would the meaning be disrupted, but the phrasing would become redundant. The *Taiping Yulan* (746) also omits *ju*. Yang Bojun notes: The *Lüshi Chunqiu’s* \"Adapting to Might\" chapter likewise states: *\"Dongye Ji was presented to Duke Zhuang for his driving skill; his advance and retreat followed the plumb line, and his left and right turns followed the compass,\"* and further: *\"For advance and retreat to follow the plumb line, and left and right turns to follow the compass—even Zaofu’s driving could not surpass this,\"* both omitting *ju*, providing further conclusive evidence.\n\nWith the Dao mastered, one travels great distances while qi and strength remain abundant—truly, the art is fully attained. What is received through the bit responds to the reins; what is received through the reins responds to the hands; what is received through the hands responds to the heart. Thus, one need not rely on the eyes to see nor the whip to urge. With the mind at ease and the body aligned, the six reins remain untangled, and the twenty-four hooves land without error. In turning, circling, advancing, or retreating, all moves accord with rhythm.\n\n[Annotation] This corresponds to the harmonious sounds of the *heluan* bells.\n\nOnly then can the space beyond the carriage wheels leave no excess tracks, and the space beyond the horse’s hooves leave no wasted ground. One remains unaware of the peril of mountains and valleys or the levelness of plains and lowlands—all appear as one. My art has reached its limit. Remember this well!\n\n[Annotation] The path one treads requires only enough space for the feet. When no excess ground is needed beyond the feet, and others dare not tread there, it is because the mind is not at peace and the body is not at ease. When the mind is at peace and the body at ease, then movement and stillness follow constant measures, and slowness and speed adhere to fixed degrees. If one fully grasps the subtleties, this principle applies not only to the self but can be extended to all things. Even with the complexity of six reins and the multitude of a horse’s hooves, as long as they are regulated by the Dao, disorder is not a concern. Thus, one does not rely on the absence of useless tracks beyond the wheels, nor on the absence of wasted ground beyond the hooves—can this not be affirmed?\n\n[Exegesis] Zhuangzi, in his explanation of butchering an ox, says: *\"Between the bones there are gaps, and the blade of the knife has no thickness. When that which has no thickness enters where there is a gap, there is ample room to move.\"* This speaks of the principle of abundant space. By not regarding the ground beyond the feet, one’s will becomes focused. With focused will, the feet move as the heart directs. If this principle is applied to reins and bits, or exchanged for fine horses, then where tracks align with hooves, what danger could there be? Most people seek only the superficial and do not grasp the root; those who recognize the truth must first seek the root before applying it. Thus, even the minor arts of archery and driving must accord with the Dao.\n\nYang Bojun notes: The exegesis cites the *Zhuangzi’s* \"Nourishing Life\" chapter but only summarizes its general meaning, not the original text.\n\nWei Hei Mao killed Qiu Bingzhang out of personal enmity.\n\n[Annotation] *Nixian* refers to private resentment.\n\n[Exegesis] Those who kill or harm out of personal enmity, or who destroy things out of desire, act according to the common ways of the world—not the conduct of one who embodies the Dao.",

Wang Shumin argues that omitting “有” or reading “其有” are both incorrect; “有” should belong to the preceding line as a caesura. “运之不知有” (*yùn zhī bù zhī yǒu*) parallels the earlier “视之不可见” (*shì zhī bù kě jiàn*).

The *Hanfeizi*’s “Wai Chu Shuo Zuo” states: “After rain ceases and the sun emerges, one gazes upon the space between *yan* and *yin*,” which aligns with this meaning. “Between *yan* and *yin*” refers to the state between clear and overcast, not dusk. Zhang’s annotation errs here. Bo Jun notes: The *Huainanzi*’s “Miucheng” chapter reads: “The gleaming sun knows *yan*; the harmonious *yin* knows rain.” The *Wen Xuan*’s “Yang Xiong’s *Yu Lie Fu*” states: “The sky is clear, the sun *yan*.” Its commentary cites Xu Shen’s annotation from the *Huainanzi*: “*Yan* is where there are no clouds.” Thus, *yan-yin* is equivalent to *qing-yin*, concurring with Sun’s interpretation.—he knelt and presented the lowest-grade sword. Lai Dan bowed twice, received it, and departed. [note] As it could be grasped and seen, he accepted the lowest. [Explanation] The more precious the implement, the deeper its harm to things. The utmost Dao and utmost refinement injure nothing. Lai Dan then took the sword and followed Black Egg. At that moment, Black Egg was drunk and reclining beneath the window—Wu Kaisheng states: *Shi* should be read as *zhi* (to encounter). Bo Jun notes: *Shi* ought to be read as in the *Lunyu*’s “Yang Huo”: “Confucius *shi* their absence,” meaning “to wait for.” Further, the *Shu Chao* (122), *Shi Lei Fu* (13), and *Taiping Yulan* (344) all read “reclining beneath the window,” and judging by the earlier phrase “reclining beneath his wife’s loom,” the version with “reclining” is correct.—and struck him three times from neck to waist. The *Shiwen* reads “waist” as *yao*, pronounced *yu xiao*, with the same pronunciation below. Black Egg did not stir. Lai Dan, believing Black Egg dead—Bo Jun notes: The *Taiping Yulan* (344) omits the character “之,” which is correct—hastened away. The *Shiwen* reads *qu* as *qu* (to hurry). At the gate, he encountered Black Egg’s son and struck him three times, as if thrusting into emptiness. Black Egg’s son was laughing and said: “Why are you so foolish as to beckon me thrice?” Yu Yue states: The *Shuowen*’s *shou* section defines *zhao* as “to summon with the hand.” Black Egg’s son did not see Lai Dan striking him with the sword but only saw him raising his hand as if beckoning, hence his words: “Why are you so foolish as to beckon me thrice?” The *Shiwen* notes: “One version reads *nian*,” which is a scribal error and should not be forced into interpretation. The *Shiwen* reads: *Zhao* in one version is *nian*, pronounced *nu jian*, meaning “to pick up an object with the fingers,” and also pronounced *dian*.

The Western Rong presented a *kunwu* sword—the *Shiwen* notes: \"*Kunwu* is a dragon sword.\" The *Hetu* states: \"On Yingzhou there are many piled stones, called *kunwu*, which can be forged into swords.\" The *Shizi* says: \"The *kunwu* sword can cut jade.\" They also presented fire-washed cloth—the *Shiwen* notes: \"*Huan* is pronounced *huan*.\" The *Yiwu Zhi* records: \"In the kingdom of Xintiao there is a Fire Continent, where trees and rats grow; their fur and pelts are woven into cloth called fire-washed cloth.\"\n\nThe sword was a *chi* and a *zhi* in length—the *Shiwen* notes: \"*Zhi* is pronounced *zhi*, and eight *cun* make one *zhi*.\" Its blade was tempered steel with a red edge, and when used, it cut jade as easily as slicing mud.\n\n**Bo Jun’s note:** The *Bowu Zhi* cites the *Zhou Shu*: \"The Western Regions presented fire-washed cloth, and the Kunwu presented a jade-cutting knife. When the fire-washed cloth is soiled, it is burned, and it becomes clean again. The jade-cutting knife (these two characters are supplied from the *Taiping Yulan*, chapter 345) cuts jade like [missing character].’ In Han times, fire-washed cloth was presented, but the knife was never heard of.\"\n\nThe fire-washed cloth, when washed, must be cast into fire. **Wang Shumin says:** The *Taiping Yulan* (chapter 820) reads \"its cloth\" instead of \"fire-washed cloth,\" matching the syntax of the earlier phrase \"its sword was a *chi* and a *zhi* in length.\" When the cloth is in fire, it takes on the color of flame; when soiled, it resumes its cloth-like hue. Taken from the fire and shaken, it gleams as if pure snow. **Annotation:** This is as stated in the *Zhou Shu*.

Thus, though jade is hard, it has a grain that can be carved; though a sword is iron, it has an edge that must sever.

The \"royal son\" is Emperor Wen of Wei, indicating that this book still saw interpolations as late as the Jian’an era.\nYu Zhengxie states: The *Commentary* to the *Book of Later Han*’s \"Account of the Southwest Barbarians\" cites the *Shen Yi Jing*: \"In the south there is a Fire Mountain, where grows an unburning tree that blazes day and night. Within the fire dwell mice weighing a hundred *jin*, their fur over two *chi* long, fine as silk, and white. Spun into cloth, if soiled, it is cleansed by fire.\" The *Taiping Guangji* records the *Liang Si Gong Ji*: \"A merchant from Nanhai brought three bolts of fire-washed cloth: two were made from the bark of trees, one from the fur of fire-mice. The wood was stiff, the fur soft.\" The *Justice* to the *Records of the Grand Historian*’s \"Account of Dayuan\" cites Wan Zhen’s *Nanzhou Zhi*: \"On the island of Sidiao in the sea of Da Qin grows a tree whose bark, stripped in winter, is spun into cloth indistinguishable from hemp or burnt cloth, its hue slightly green-black. If soiled, it becomes immaculate when placed in fire—hence the name fire-washed cloth. The people of Qin call it the bark of the *dingzhongshenjian* tree.\" It also cites the *Kuodi Zhi*: \"In the Fire Mountain country, within the fire, are white mouse fur and tree bark, spun into fire-washed cloth.\" Ren Fang’s *Shu Yi Ji* states: \"In the south, the Fire Mountain burns from the fourth to the twelfth month. When the fire dies, grass and trees sprout branches and leaves; when it revives, they shed. The bark is spun into fire-washed cloth.\" Kuang Lu’s *Chi Ya* notes: \"Among the Miao, fire-washed cloth comes in three kinds: *bifang* hemp, *zhurong* wood, and fire-mouse fur.\" As for its use, the *Commentary* to the *Book of Later Han*’s \"Account of the Western Barbarians\" cites Fu Zi: \"Elders say that during the reign of Emperor Huan of Han, Liang Ji made a robe of fire-washed cloth. When entertaining guests, he poured wine and feigned soiling it. Burning it, the grime vanished, the fire extinguished, and it emerged gleaming white as if washed in water.\" Cai Tao’s *Tiewei Shan Congtan* records: \"Fire-washed cloth resembles cotton cloth, its color dark green. Cast into fire, it turns pure white. After the Xuanhe and Zhenghe eras, it arrived in abundance, and the imperial storehouse stitched it into kerchiefs, bedding, skirts, and robes.\" Thus, it first reached China in the Eastern Han, becoming common Southern merchandise by the Song. Jiang Shaoshu’s *Yunshi Zhai Bitan* observes: \"Fire-washed cloth is slightly white; when brushed by hand, it leaves powder on the fingers, like touching a butterfly’s wings.\" This, then, is cloth spun from bark, its residual oil still present—a mundane thing. Today, in the borderlands of Yuexi Hall in Sichuan, within the crevices of the Wuman Mountains, grows a grass root called *buxiumu* (\"undecaying wood\"), its nature purely yin. Woven into cloth, it is washed with fire. The *Sichuan Tongzhi* states: \"Only the destitute use it.\" The *Baopuzi*’s \"On Immortals\" records: \"Emperor Wen of Wei claimed the world had no jade-cutting knives or fire-washed cloth. When he wrote the *Dian Lun* and asserted this, before long both objects arrived. The emperor sighed and promptly destroyed the work.\" Now, examining the text: \"Emperor Wen said that the notion of fire-mouse fur as cloth, cleansed by fire when soiled, was false. Fire has no power to nurture life—how could mice live within it? He had the *Dian Lun* engraved at the Imperial Academy.

Further, *The Complete Prose of the Jin Dynasty* includes the *\"Fu on the Wondrous Cloth of Ban Ju\"*, whose preface states that in the second year of Taikang (281 CE), the Da Qin kingdom presented tribute, and the fire-washed cloth was particularly marvelous, prompting the composition of the *fu*—this was the same fire-washed cloth.\n\nAnother note: In the phrase *\"fu jin zhi bu neng qie yu zhe ji bu zhi bu neng huan yu huo\"* (\"that metal cannot cut jade and cloth cannot be washed in fire\"), the two *\"bu\"* (\"not\") characters appear to be superfluous.

      "translated_text": "The *Annotation* states: \"Fate\" refers to the inevitable term, the inherently fixed portion. Though this matter has yet to be verified, this principle is already so. To believe that longevity or early death depends on nurture and care, or that success or failure hinges on wisdom and effort, is to be deluded about the principles of Heaven.\n\nThe *Exegesis* states: \"Fate\" is the fixed portion, which cannot be realized without effort; \"effort\" is the power of advancement, which cannot be fulfilled without fate. Those endowed with fate must rely on effort; those who exert effort may or may not align with their fate. There are things effort cannot achieve—this is the absence of fate; relying on fate without striving is merely awaiting the right moment. Those who trust fate but not effort err greatly; those who trust effort but not fate are also not correct.\n\nThe *Exegesis* notes: *Fen* (portion) is pronounced *fu wen*; *yao* (early death) is pronounced *yu zhao*; *xi* (hinge) is read as *ji*.\n\nEffort said to Fate: \"What is your merit compared to mine?\"\nFate replied: \"What merit do you have over things that you dare compare yourself to me?\"\nEffort said: \"Longevity or early death, success or failure, nobility or baseness, wealth or poverty—these are all within my power.\"\nFate said: \"Peng Zu’s wisdom did not surpass that of Yao and Shun, yet he lived eight hundred years.\"\nKong Guangsen notes: Peng Zu was the ancestor of the Peng clan. The Peng clan included several states: Da Peng, Shi Wei, and Zhu Ji. Da Peng served the Xia and Yu dynasties and became a lord under the Shang, but was destroyed during the reign of Wu Ding. Thus, \"Peng Zu lived eight hundred years\" refers to the Peng state lasting eight hundred years before its fall, not that Jian himself was immortal.\nYan Kejun notes: In the *Discourses of Zheng*, Historian Bo said: \"Among the eight descendants of Zhu Rong, Da Peng and Shi Wei were lords under the Shang.\" The Peng clan included Peng Zu, Shi Wei, and Zhu Ji, all of whom were destroyed by the Shang. Wei Zhao explains: \"Da Peng was the third son of Lu Zhong, named Jian, who founded the Peng clan and was enfeoffed at Da Peng, hence called Peng Zu.\" He also explains: \"Peng Zu refers to Da Peng.\" The *Records of the Grand Historian: House of Chu* states: \"Lu Zhong had six sons; the third was Peng Zu.\" The *Collected Explanations* cites Yu Fan: \"His name was Jian; he founded the Peng clan, was enfeoffed at Da Peng, and was called Peng Zu.\" The *Index* cites the *Genealogical Records*: \"The third son was Jian Keng, known as Peng Zu.\" The *Book of Zhou: Explanation of Wheat* states: \"August Heaven pitied Yu and granted him the longevity of Peng, to rectify the Xia’s decline.\" The *Bamboo Annals* records: \"In the fifteenth year of Emperor Qi, Wu Guan rebelled in the West River. Peng Bo Shou led troops to suppress the West River and decisively defeated them.\" Thus, Peng Zu was a state name, namely Da Peng, which served as a regional lord under the Xia and Shang, one of the Five Hegemons of antiquity. It was enfeoffed during the Tang and Yu dynasties, passed through dozens of generations, lasted eight hundred years, and was destroyed by the Shang—this is the historical fact. \"Peng Zu lived eight hundred years\" is akin to saying the Xia lasted four hundred years, the Shang six hundred, and the Zhou eight hundred.\nMa Xulun notes: Kong and Yan’s explanations are correct. The *Zhuangzi: Free and Easy Wandering* states: \"Yet Peng Zu is still renowned for his longevity.\" It seems Zhuangzi also mistakenly believed Peng Zu lived seven or eight hundred years.

Though he was said to have died young, if we examine reliable records such as the *Zuozhuan* and *Records of the Grand Historian*, we can confidently assert that he did not die at eighteen.

Confucius said: \"At fifty, I understood the *ming* of Heaven.\" \"He who does not understand *ming* cannot be a noble person.\" Yet when he traveled through the states on diplomatic missions, he longed to be a groom holding the whip—this was not forgetting *li*.\n\n**Yang Bojun’s note:** The exegesis cites Zhuangzi from the \"Human World\" chapter, omitting the word *er* (而) after *he* (何).

      "translated_text": "Those who slumber awaken at the break of dawn. Beigongzi had slumbered long before suddenly awakening—hence the saying, \"How easily dawned upon!\" The *Shiwen* notes *dàn* (旦) as *dāng gē* cut, though its pronunciation remains uncertain. Some write it as *wù* (悟), a later emendation by those who failed to grasp its meaning.\n\n**Bo Jun’s Note:** According to Lu’s commentary, the *Chongxuan* edition also writes *dá* (怛). The *Shiwen* renders *wù* (悟) as *dá* (怛), stating: \"*Dá* (怛), *dāng gē* cut; writing it as *wù* (悟) is incorrect.\"\n\nGuan Yiwu and Bao Shuya shared a bond of profound kinship. **Bo Jun’s Note:** In the *Mencius* (\"Gaozi, Part II\"), it is written: \"When his elder brother drew the bow to shoot him, he wept and pleaded with him. There was no other reason—it was kinship.\" The commentary explains: \"*Qī* (戚) means 'intimacy.'\"\n\nThe *Shiwen* states: Guan Yiwu and Bao Shuya were both natives of Yingchuan. Bao Ya was a grandee of Qi, his tomb located in Yingzhou. **Bo Jun’s Note:** The *Shiwen*’s \"Bao Ya\" should read \"Bao Shu.\"\n\nThey both resided in Qi. Guan Yiwu served Prince Jiu. The *Shiwen* notes: *Jiǔ* (纠), *guī yǒu* cut. Bao Shuya served Prince Xiaobai. The Qi royal clan was rife with favoritism, with legitimate and illegitimate lines treated equally. **Note:** Qi Xigong’s younger brother, Yizhong, fathered Prince Wuzhi. Xigong doted on him, granting him rites and rank equal to the crown prince. The *Shiwen* notes: *Dí* (嫡), *dí* sound. *Xī* (僖), *xǔ qí* cut, sometimes written as *lí* (厘). The people of the state feared chaos.\n\nGuan Zhong and Shao Hu escorted Prince Jiu in flight to Lu. **Note:** Jiu was Duke Xiang’s younger brother. The *Shiwen* notes: *Shào* (召) is written as *Shào* (邵) in some editions. Bao Shu escorted Prince Xiaobai in flight to Ju. **Note:** Xiaobai was Jiu’s younger brother. The *Shiwen* notes: *Jǔ* (莒), *jǔ* sound.\n\nLater, Prince Wuzhi staged a rebellion. **Note:** After Duke Xiang ascended, he demoted Wuzhi’s rank and attire, leading Wuzhi to kill the duke and seize the throne. The people of the state soon killed him. The *Shiwen* notes: *Chù* (绌), *chù* sound, also *shì hū* cut. *Zhì* (秩), *zhì* sound. *Shā* (杀), *shì* sound.\n\nWith Qi lacking a ruler, the two princes vied to enter. Guan Yiwu clashed with Xiaobai in Ju, shooting him in the belt hook along the way. The *Shiwen* notes: *Shè* (射), *shí yì* cut. *Zhòng* (中), *dīng zhòng* cut. Once Xiaobai ascended the throne—**Note:** Xiaobai was Duke Huan—he coerced Lu into killing Prince Jiu. The *Shiwen* writes *xié* (胁) as *lā* (搚), noting: \"Also written as *xié* (胁).\" Shao Hu died for him, while Guan Yiwu was imprisoned. **Note:** Qi informed Lu: \"Prince Jiu was our brother; we could not bear to execute him ourselves, so we ask you to kill him. Shao Hu and Guan Zhong were our enemies; we wish to savor their flesh as mincemeat. If you refuse, we will destroy Lu.\" Fearing this, Lu killed Prince Jiu. Shao Hu took his own life, while Guan Zhong requested imprisonment.\n\nBao Shuya told Duke Huan: \"Guan Yiwu is capable—he can govern the state.\" The *Shiwen* notes: *Zhì* (治), *zhí lì* cut. Duke Huan replied: \"He is my enemy; I wish to kill him.\" Bao Shuya said: \"I have heard that a worthy ruler bears no private grudges. Moreover, one who can serve his lord can also serve a ruler. If you seek hegemony, **The *Shiwen* notes:** *Wáng* (王), *yú kuàng* cut. none but Yiwu will suffice. You must pardon him!\" The *Shiwen* notes: *Shě* (舍), *shì* sound. Duke Huan then summoned Guan Zhong. Lu returned him to Qi, where Bao Shuya welcomed him beyond the outskirts and freed him from captivity. Duke Huan treated him with ritual propriety—**Note:** Bao Shu personally met Guan Zhong at Tangfu, removing his shackles, and presented him to Duke Huan at Qi’s outskirts. The *Shiwen* notes: *Fù* (阜), *fù* sound. Jia Kui said: \"Tangfu lies on Lu’s northern border.\" Du Yu said: \"It is a Qi territory in Dongguan.\" *Jiàn* (见), *xián biàn* cut. **Bo Jun’s Note:** Tangfu is located northwest of present-day Mengyin County, Linyi Prefecture, Shandong—Qi territory. He was placed above Gao and Guo, while Bao Shuya humbled himself beneath him. **The *Shiwen* notes:** *Xià* (下), *xiá jià* cut. Entrusted with state governance, he was styled \"Zhongfu.\" The *Shiwen* notes: *Fù* (父), *fǔ* sound. Duke Huan thus became a hegemon.\n\nGuan Zhong once sighed: \"In my youth, when I was poor and destitute, I once traded with Bao Shu. The *Shiwen* notes: *Gǔ* (贾), *gǔ* sound. I kept more of the profits for myself, yet Bao Shu did not think me greedy—he knew I was impoverished. I once devised a plan for Bao Shu that led to great hardship. The *Shiwen* notes: *Wéi* (为), *yú wěi* cut. He did not think me foolish—he knew some times are favorable, others not. I served thrice and was thrice dismissed by my lord; Bao Shu did not think me worthless—he knew I had not met my time. I fought thrice and fled thrice; Bao Shu did not think me cowardly—he knew I had an aged mother. When Prince Jiu was defeated, Shao Hu died for him while I endured imprisonment and humiliation. Bao Shu did not think me shameless—he knew I did not scorn minor setbacks but felt shame if my name **Wang Shumin notes:** The *Caotang Shiji* (7) includes the word *gōng* (功) before *míng* (名), which should be followed. The *Records of the Grand Historian* (\"Biographies of Guan and Yan\") and Liu Xiang’s *Preface to the Guanzi* also include *gōng* (功). failed to resound throughout the world. My parents gave me life, but Bao Shu truly knew me!\"\n\nThis is why the world praises Guan and Bao’s fine friendship and Xiaobai’s skill in employing talent. Yet in truth, there was no fine friendship, nor was there skill in employing talent. That there was no fine friendship and no skill in employing talent does not mean there exists some other fine friendship or skill in employing talent. **Note:** This clarifies that in principle, there is no fine friendship or skill in employing talent—this is not limited to Guan, Bao, or Duke Huan. **Exegesis:** When one’s fate aligns with its use, one attains success through friendship—this does not imply some other fine friendship or skill in employing talent. Thus, relying on talent to gain office is a matter of fate, while achieving success through friendship is a matter of effort.",

      "translated_text": "Not only does Heaven’s timing play its part, but even those who succeed through human planning and effort ultimately return to fate. When fate arrives, Bao Shu could not but exert all his strength, and Duke Huan could not but employ him—all was fate! Shujun notes: Below \"there exists some other skill in employing talent,\" a \"者\" should likely be added.\n\nZhao Hu was not capable of dying, yet could not but die; Bao Shu was not capable of recommending the worthy, yet could not but recommend; Duke Huan was not capable of employing his foe, yet could not but employ him. **Annotation:** All these were driven by unseen forces, not governed by human effort. **Exegesis:** Fate is perfected through effort, and effort is perfected through fate—there is no partiality in this.\n\nThe original text read \"human principle\" (人理) for \"human effort\" (人力), but the present version follows the *Zang* edition’s correction.\n\nWhen Guan Yiwu fell ill, Duke Huan visited him and said, \"Your illness has become grave—it cannot be concealed. **Annotation:** The severity of the illness leaves no room for concealment. **Exegesis:** When death approaches, it cannot be denied. The *Shide Tang* edition reads \"the illness is severe\" (病疾矣). Yu Yue argues: The *Lu Chongxuan* edition has \"病\" instead of \"疾,\" which should be followed. The *Zhuangzi*'s *Xu Wugui* chapter concurs. Shujun notes: The Northern Song edition, *Zang* edition, *Jifu* edition, and *Sijie* edition all read \"病,\" as do the *Yanzi* and *Zhiyou* quotations. The original likely read \"疾病.\" The *Shuowen* states: \"疾 means illness; 病 means illness worsening.\" In ancient texts, severe illness is always termed *jibing* (疾病). For example, the *Lunyu* (*Zihan* chapter) says, \"When the Master’s illness worsened, Zilu had his disciples act as retainers\" (Zheng Xuan’s note: \"病 refers to illness growing more severe\"). The *Yili* (*Jixi Ji*) states, \"In severe illness, both inner and outer chambers are swept clean\" (Zheng Xuan’s note: \"Severe illness is called 病\"). The *Zuozhuan* (*Xuan* 15th year) records: \"When ill, Meng Ke said, 'You must marry her!' When the illness worsened, he said, 'You must bury her with me!' Upon his death, Meng Ke married her, saying, 'When illness worsens, one’s mind is disordered—I follow what is proper.'\" The *Zuozhuan* (*Xiang* 19th year) also states: \"When the Marquis of Qi fell ill, Cui Zhu secretly welcomed Guang; when the illness worsened, he enthroned him.\" The *Zuozhuan* (*Huan* 5th year) further notes: \"When the Duke’s illness worsened, chaos erupted.\" All these are examples of *jibing* (疾病) used together. The *Lüshi Chunqiu* (*Zhijie* chapter) likewise says, \"Your illness has become grave—what teachings will you leave me?\" This is further confirmation. The *Shide Tang* edition reads \"病疾,\" a reversal of the proper order; later scholars, failing to recognize this, hastily altered it to \"病病.\" Yu Yue’s argument is incorrect. The *Shiwen* notes: *fu* (復) is read as *fuyou*.\n\n\"When it comes to a fatal illness, to whom should I entrust the state?\" Wang Chongmin argues: Zhang’s annotation states, \"The severity of the illness leaves no room for concealment.\" Based on this, the original text’s \"可不\" should be transposed. The *Guanzi* (*Jie* and *Xiaochen* chapters) both read \"不可讳.\" Zhang’s interpretation, taking \"可不讳云\" as a single phrase and explaining it as \"cannot be concealed,\" is also incorrect. The word *yun* (云) should be read as the start of the next clause, meaning \"like\" or \"as if.\" See the *Shici* for examples. The *Zhiyou* omits these four characters, likely because its compiler did not grasp their meaning.\n\nShujun notes: Wang’s argument is sound. The *Liji* (*Tangong*) states: \"When Cheng Zigao was gravely ill, Qing Yi entered and asked, 'Your illness has become critical—if it reaches a fatal stage, what then?'\" Here, \"云至于大病\" parallels \"如至乎大病也.\" The *Shiwen* notes: *wu* (恶) is read as *wu*; *zhu* (属) is read as *zhu*.\n\nGuan Yiwu asked, \"Whom does Your Lordship desire?\" The *Shiwen* notes: *yu* (欤) is read as *yu*.\n\nDuke Huan said, \"Bao Shuya would be suitable.\"\nGuan Yiwu replied, \"He is not. His character is that of a pure and upright gentleman. **Annotation:** He merely keeps himself unsullied. The \"也\" after \"人\" is added following the *Zang* edition to match the structure of \"其为人也\" below. The *Shiwen* reads \"洁\" as \"絜,\" pronounced *jie*. Toward those who do not match his standards, he does not associate. **Annotation:** He seeks to align all things with his own virtue. If he hears of another’s fault, he never forgets it. **Annotation:** He cannot overlook flaws to record virtues. The *Shiwen* notes: *xia* (瑕) is pronounced *xia*.\n\nIf you appoint him to govern the state, above he will constrain his lord, and below he will oppose the people. **Annotation:** He will inevitably invoke the lord’s commands, but his Way is not expansive. If the Way is not expansive, he will oppose the people and fail to guide them. Wang Chongmin argues: The *Zhuangzi* (*Xu Wugui* chapter) reads \"治国\" instead of \"理国\"—this should also be \"治,\" altered to avoid taboo. The *Zhiyou* correctly reads \"治.\"\n\nHis offense against his lord will not be long in coming.\" The *Zhiyou* omits the \"也.\"\n\nDuke Huan said, \"Then who is suitable?\"\nGuan Yiwu replied, \"If you must choose, then Xi Peng is suitable. **Annotation:** He is not necessarily suitable, but there is no better option. The *Shiwen* notes: *xi* (隰) is pronounced *xi*.\n\nHis character is such that above he forgets his rank, and below he does not rebel. **Annotation:** Occupying a high position yet forgetting himself, he need not fear the people’s dispersal. Wang Chongmin argues: Zhang’s explanation is incorrect. The *Zhuangzi* reads \"上忘而下畔,\" with an extra \"不.\" *Pan* (畔) is interchangeable with *pan* (叛), meaning \"rebellious slander.\" *Pan* and *yan* (谚) are rhyming words, a common pairing in ancient speech.\"",

Liu Yuanlin’s annotation to the *Weidu Fu* explains: \"叛换 is like 恣睢\" (\"arbitrary and unrestrained\"). Thus, \"上忘而下不叛\" means \"toward superiors, he forgets his loftiness; toward inferiors, he does not assert dominance.\" Hence, the following text states: \"He who with virtue defers to others has never failed to win them.\" Guo Xiang’s annotation to the *Zhuangzi*—\"high yet not overbearing\"—captures its essence.\n\nBo Jun’s note: The *Lüshi Chunqiu* *Guigong* chapter reads \"上志而下求\" (\"above, he is mindful; below, he seeks\").\n\nHe feels shame before those not equal to the Yellow Emperor and pities those not equal to himself.\n**Annotation:** Ashamed that his Dao does not match the sages, and compassionate toward those whose people fall short of his own, he thus discards no one.\n**Explanation:** Forgetting his own loftiness and ashamed of his lack of virtue, his resolve to embrace goodness runs deep. Toward those inferior to himself, he feels pity and compassion, so his subordinates do not rebel or disperse.\n\nWang Chongmin notes: The *Zhiyao* omits the character \"其\" after \"愧,\" which is correct. Neither the *Zhuangzi* *Xu Wugui* chapter nor the *Lüshi Chunqiu* *Guigong* chapter includes it, confirming this.\n\nOne who shares virtue with others is called a sage.\n**Annotation:** He transforms others to align with the Dao without imposing control.\n\nOne who shares wealth with others is called a worthy.\n**Annotation:** The more he gives, the more he possesses.\n\nTo govern others with worthiness never wins their allegiance.\n**Annotation:** Demanding perfection from others, things will not comply.\nWang Chongmin notes: The *Zhiyao* includes the character \"者\" after the first \"人,\" which is correct. This parallels the following sentence: \"以贤下人者未有不得人者也.\" Since the latter includes \"者,\" it is clear the former originally did as well. The *Zhuangzi* omits both \"者\" characters, a divergence between the *Zhuangzi* and *Liezi*. However, this may serve as indirect evidence that the first sentence should include \"者.\"\n\nHe who with worthiness defers to others has never failed to win them.\n**Annotation:** One who rises and falls with things will surely be embraced by them.\nWang Chongmin notes: The *Zhiyao* includes the characters \"之也\" after \"归\" in the annotation.\n\nIn governing the state, there are things he does not hear; in managing the household, there are things he does not see.\n**Annotation:** When the Dao prevails, there is no need for excessive hearing or seeing. Thus, it is said: \"One who is neither blind nor deaf cannot achieve success.\"\nWang Chongmin notes: The *Zhiyao* renders \"烦\" as \"赖\" in the annotation.\nBo Jun’s note: The *Lüshi Chunqiu* *Guigong* chapter includes the sentence \"其于物也有不知也\" after \"有不闻也.\"\n\n**Annotation by Guo Xiang:** If he were to hear and see everything, affairs would center on himself, leaving subordinates nowhere to place their hands and feet. Thus, disregarding such matters is acceptable. Since he cannot fully embody the Dao, merely this is permissible.\n**Explanation:** Not demanding the ordinary nature of things is \"not hearing in the state.\" Not seeking others’ minor faults is \"not seeing in the household.\"\nThe *Zhiyao* renders \"群下\" as \"群生\" in the annotation.\n\nThus, the *Shiwen* notes: \"仅 is pronounced *jin*.\"\n\nIn this case, Guan Yiwu’s slighting of Bao Shu was not intentional; he could not but slight him. His favoring of Xi Peng was not deliberate; he could not but favor him. Favor at the outset may turn to slight in the end; slight in the end may turn to favor at the outset. Tao Hongqing states: The phrase \"薄之于终，或厚之于始\" should read \"薄之于始，或厚之于终\" (\"slight at the outset may turn to favor in the end\"). The current version redundantly echoes the preceding two sentences. The ebb and flow of favor and slight do not depend on me.\n**Annotation:** All is the principle of Heaven.\n**Explanation:** Yiwu’s feelings held no inherent favor or slight; this was a public recommendation. Recommending someone was favor; not recommending was slight. All was a matter of effort. Since Duke Huan did not employ Bao Shu, it was Bao Shu’s fate. Employing Xi Peng was Xi Peng’s fate. Had Bao Shu lacked fate, Yiwu’s efforts would have been futile. Had Xi Peng lacked fate, Yiwu’s efforts, though exerted, would have been in vain.\n\nDeng Xi wielded the doctrine of dual possibilities.\n**Annotation by the *Shiwen*:** *Xi* is pronounced *xi*.\nDeng Xi authored two chapters. A native of Zheng, he was a contemporary of Zichan. Both the *Liezi* and Xunzi state that Zichan killed Deng Xi, but according to the *Zuozhuan*, Zichan died in the twentieth year of Duke Zhao, while in the ninth year of Duke Ding, Si Luan killed Deng Xi and adopted his bamboo penal code. Thus, he was not killed by Zichan.\n**Annotation:** *Cao* is pronounced *qi dao*.\nRen Dachun states: The account of Zichan killing Deng Xi appears in various philosophical works, not just Xunzi and Liezi. The *Lüshi Chunqiu* *Liwei* chapter records: \"When Zichan governed Zheng, Deng Xi devoted himself to challenging him. Those among the people with lawsuits would offer a robe for major cases or a jacket and scallions for minor ones. The number of people presenting robes, jackets, and scallions to learn litigation became innumerable. He inverted right and wrong, turning wrong into right and right into wrong.\"",
      "overlap_context": "ion. The *Shiwen* notes: *xi* (隰) is pronounced *xi*.\n\nHis character is such that above he forgets his rank, and below he does not rebel. **Annotation:** Occupying a high position yet forgetting himself, he need not fear the people’s dispersal. Wang Chongmin argues: Zhang’s explanation is incorrect. The *Zhuangzi* reads \"上忘而下畔,\" with an extra \"不.\" *Pan* (畔) is interchangeable with *pan* (叛), meaning \"rebellious slander.\" *Pan* and *yan* (谚) are rhyming words, a common pairing in ancient speech.\"",

The state of Zheng fell into great disorder, and the people’s voices clamored in uproar. Zichan, troubled by this, thereupon executed Deng Xi and exposed his corpse, and the people were greatly subdued.\n\nThe *Huainanzi*’s *Quan yan xun* states: “Deng Xi was clever in disputation and subverted the law.” Gao You’s commentary notes: “Deng Xi taught the people of Zheng to litigate, and litigation brought no calamity. Zichan executed him for this.”\n\nYang Liang’s commentary on the *Xunzi*’s *Zheng lun* chapter cites the *Xin xu* as saying: “When Zichan judged cases, Deng Xi taught the people to challenge him. For major lawsuits, they pledged a robe; for minor ones, a jacket and scallions. The number of people presenting robes, jackets, and scallions to study litigation became innumerable. He inverted wrong into right and right into wrong. The state of Zheng fell into great disorder, and the people’s voices clamored in uproar. Zichan, troubled by this, thereupon punished Deng Xi and exposed his corpse, and the people were subdued; right and wrong were thus settled.” This account is of the same kind.\n\nThe claim that Deng Xi was not executed by Zichan first appears in Zhang Zhan’s commentary on the *Liezi*, under the phrase “soon after, he was executed.” Zhang Zhan’s note states: “The *Liezi* says Zichan executed Deng Xi, but the *Zuozhuan* records that Si Luan killed Deng Xi and adopted his bamboo penal code—Deng Xi died twenty years after Zichan’s death.” Jing Shun’s *Shiwen* further elaborates on this annotation, stating that Zichan died in the twentieth year of Duke Zhao, and Si Luan killed Deng Xi in the ninth year of Duke Ding—thus, Deng Xi’s death occurred twenty years after Zichan’s.\n\nYang Liang’s commentary on the *Xunzi*’s *Bu gou* chapter also notes: “The *Zuozhuan* states that Si Luan of Zheng killed Deng Xi and adopted his bamboo penal code, so the claim that Zichan executed him is likely an error.” This annotation, like Jing Shun’s *Shiwen*, is based on Zhang Zhan’s commentary.\n\nHe crafted endless arguments while Zichan held office and created the bamboo penal code.\n**Annotation:** *Bamboo penal code* refers to laws inscribed on bamboo slips.\nLu Wenchong remarks: The annotation “bamboo penal code, laws on bamboo slips” should perhaps read “bamboo-slip penal code.” Bo Jun notes: Lu’s suggestion does not clarify Zhang’s intent; Zhang’s annotation likely explains *bamboo penal code* as *laws on bamboo slips*.\n\nThe state of Zheng adopted it, repeatedly challenging Zichan’s governance.\n**Annotation:** *Shuo* is pronounced *shuo*. *Nan* is pronounced *nandan*.\n\nZichan was confounded by this. Zichan arrested and executed him, soon after putting him to death.\n**Annotation:** This tradition states that Zichan executed Deng Xi, but the *Zuozhuan* records that Si Luan killed Deng Xi and adopted his bamboo penal code—Deng Xi died twenty years after Zichan’s death.\nBo Jun notes: The phrase “Zichan arrested and executed him” contains a superfluous repetition of “Zichan,” likely interpolated from the preceding text. “Executed him” and “put him to death” are redundant. It is suspected that *lu* (executed) should instead read *ju* (arrested). The *Taiping Yulan* (626) omits the eight characters “was confounded by this.

      "translated_text": "Thus, Zichan was not truly able to employ the bamboo penal code—he had no choice but to use it. Deng Xi was not truly able to humble Zichan—he had no choice but to submit. Zichan was not truly able to execute Deng Xi—he had no choice but to put him to death.\n\n**Annotation:** The principle of this passage aligns with that of the preceding one.\n\n**Explication:** To establish laws is a matter of power; to suffer execution is a matter of fate. To enforce those laws is also a matter of power; to put their author to death is also a matter of fate. To wield power in affairs is a matter of talent; for talent to go unrecognized is also a matter of fate. The Northern Song edition, Wang’s edition, and the Shidetang edition all omit the character *zhang* (\"passage\"); this follows the *Zang* edition’s addition.\n\nThose who may live and do live—some accumulate virtue and practice benevolence, some encounter favorable times and prosper, gaining the world’s favor and fulfilling their own aspirations, as if by retribution, as though through wisdom and effort. The Shidetang edition’s annotation omits the character *ye* (\"also\") at the end. This is Heaven’s blessing. Some are simply born, simply at peace—this is not necessarily due to benevolence, virtue, or wisdom. Yet to walk the path of trust and compliance, to fulfill one’s aspirations, to live out one’s years without care or peril—what but Heaven’s blessing could account for this?\n\n**Phonetic Annotation:** *Xing* (conduct) is pronounced *xia meng*.\n\nThose who may die and do die—some accumulate evil and commit violence, some suffer hunger, cold, and destitution, thus scorning punishment and execution, forsaking survival, and meeting their end in death, as if self-inflicted, as though responding to circumstance. The *Zang* edition’s annotation reads *yi* (\"with\") for *yu* (\"in\"), while the Shidetang edition reads *er* (\"and\"). This, too, is Heaven’s blessing. Some simply die, simply meet their end—this is not necessarily due to cruelty or folly. Yet to indulge a cruel heart, to dwell in a state where survival is untenable, and to meet one’s end in death—such a death is a fitting death, and thus it, too, is called Heaven’s blessing.\n\n**Explication:** To live when life is possible is Heaven’s blessing; to die when death is fitting is also Heaven’s blessing. For example, Yiwu sought life in the time of Duke Huan of Qi and secured his survival—this was truly Heaven’s blessing. Or consider Chu Ni, who dashed his head against a locust tree to meet his end, preserving his lord’s command and sparing a worthy man from harm, thus securing his death and an undying name—this, too, was Heaven’s blessing. The *Daozang Sijie* edition of the *Zang* reads *yi* (\"with\") for *yu* (\"in\") in the annotation “meeting their end in death.”\n\nThose who may live but do not—dwelling in prosperity and ease, wishing for long life yet meeting an early end. This is Heaven’s punishment. To wish for life yet not attain it is called Heaven’s punishment.\n\nThose who may die but do not—dwelling in hardship and humiliation, wishing not to live long yet enduring beyond death. The various editions omit the character *jiu* (\"long\") before *sheng* (\"life\"). This, too, is Heaven’s punishment. To scorn death yet not die is also Heaven’s punishment.\n\n**Explication:** Dwelling in prosperity and ease, occupying a lofty position—this is to be able to live yet not live, as with Dong Xian and the like. Dwelling in hardship and humiliation, enduring suffering and adversity—this is to be able to die yet not die, as with the human swine and the like. To seek yet not attain—both are Heaven’s punishment.\n\nThere are those who may live or die and do live or die. There are those who may neither live nor die, yet some die and some live. **Annotation:** This refers to those who, in this circumstance, live and do live, or die and do die. The two preceding lines have already encompassed this meaning, and their repetition here is suspect; likely a textual error. Tao Hongqing said: The two *bu* (\"not\") characters are superfluous; the original text read, “Those who may live or die, some die and some live.” This speaks of those who may live yet die, or may die yet live. Zhang’s annotation states: “This refers to those who, in this circumstance, live yet die, or die yet live.” This suggests that the edition he consulted lacked the two *bu* characters. The preceding passage states, “Those who may live yet do not live suffer Heaven’s punishment; those who may die yet do not die suffer Heaven’s punishment”—its meaning aligns with this, hence Zhang’s annotation also suspects repetition.\n\n**Phonetic Annotation:** *Chong* (repetition) is pronounced *zhu yong*.\n\nYet life and death, life and death—neither due to things nor to the self—are all a matter of fate. There is nothing wisdom can do.\n\n**Annotation:** Since the principle of life and death is unfathomable, death does not arise from things, nor does life reside in the self—how could wisdom avail?\n\n**Explication:** Not due to things, nor due to the self; when knowledge cannot prevail and effort cannot succeed, only then may one submit to fate. The Yuan edition and the Shidetang edition’s annotation read *bi* (\"must\") for *ru* (\"how\") at the end.\n\nThus it is said: Profound and boundless, the Dao of Heaven converges of itself; vast and undifferentiated, the Dao of Heaven moves of itself.\n\n**Annotation:** Boundless and undifferentiated—this is the ultimate of spontaneity. To converge and move of itself—how could it be compelled?\n\nJiang Yougao said: *Ji* (convergence) and *hui* (meeting) rhyme, both in the ancient *zhi* (*祭*) rhyme group. *Fen* (division) and *yun* (movement) rhyme, both in the ancient *wen* (*文*) rhyme group.\n\n**Phonetic Annotation:** *Fen* is pronounced *fu wen*; the annotation is the same.\n\nHeaven and Earth cannot transgress it.\n\n**Annotation:** Though Heaven and Earth are vast, they cannot defy spontaneity.\n\nThe sage and the wise cannot interfere with it.\n\n**Annotation:** Though the sagely and the divine are wondrous, they cannot contravene the workings of time.\n\nGhosts and demons cannot deceive it.\n\n**Annotation:** Though ghosts and demons are uncanny, they cannot falsify what is true and upright.\n\n**Phonetic Annotation:** *Mei* is written as *魅*; the annotation states: some write it as *媚*.\n\nThat which is spontaneous completes in silence.\n\n**Annotation:** *Mo* means \"without.\"\n\nLevels and pacifies.\n\n**Annotation:** To level and pacify requires no action.\n\nGuides and welcomes.\n\n**Annotation:** Without loss or ruin, it seems as though it guides and welcomes.",

What then is lost by calculation?\"\n\n**[Annotation]:** *Suan* (算) here means \"wisdom\" or \"discernment.\"\n\n**[Interpretation]:** If one understands that the body’s recompense is as it is, then one will not be swayed by personal feelings. Personal feelings involve prizing and cherishing, despising and slighting. The body’s thickness or thinness does not follow the weight of such feelings—thus, what is gained may seem compliant, and what is attained may seem contradictory. Yet in truth, it is neither compliant nor contradictory, just as length and shortness, beauty and ugliness, are not altered by personal affection. They are beyond the reach of wisdom and calculation.\n\nQin Enfu notes: Lu’s interpretation of *baowei* (报为) may have an error in the character *wei* (为).\n\n**Phonetic Annotation:** *Suan* (算) is pronounced *xiàn*. *Wang* (亡) is pronounced *wú*.\n\nLaozi addressed Guan Yin, saying: \"Who knows the reason for what Heaven detests?\"\n\n**[Annotation]:** Wang Bi said: \"*Shu* (孰) means 'who.'

Who can know the reason for what Heaven detests? Only the sage, perhaps!\" Zhang’s annotation quotes an abridged version.\n\n**Phonetic Annotation:** *E* (恶) is pronounced *wù*.\n\nTo anticipate Heaven’s will and weigh profit and harm is not as good as following one’s own nature.\n\n**[Annotation]:** One who follows the heavenly principle without contrivance cannot be violated by ghosts and spirits or disturbed by human affairs. But to anticipate Heaven’s will, calculate fortune and misfortune, embrace compliance to avoid opposition, and pursue profit while shunning harm—this merely sets one in great opposition to adversity and harm. It is the height of clever calculation, yet it cannot prevent the arising of good and ill fortune or the exhaustion of blessings and calamities.\n\n**[Interpretation]:** Those who do not know the Dao—how could they know what Heaven loves or hates? To preempt Heaven’s will, weigh profit and harm, and act from personal feeling is to fail to follow principle and entrust oneself to fate. This chapter speaks of the inability of human effort to alter fate, and the unknowability of fate in advance. To entrust oneself to it is to lag behind the times; to strive against it is to defy fate. Thus it rebukes those who know the Dao yet cultivate spirit, nurture authenticity, initiate undertakings, and strive to turn fate to their will, contending with Heaven.\n\nQin Enfu notes: Lu’s interpretation under \"knowing the Dao\" may have an omission.\n\n**Phonetic Annotation:** *Chuai* (揣) is pronounced *chuǎi*. *Liao* (料) is pronounced *liáo*.\n\nYang Bu—\n\n**[Annotation]:** Younger brother of Yang Zhu.\n\n—asked: \"Consider a man here: in age, he and his brother are alike; in speech, they are alike—Yu Yue said: The character *yan* (言) is meaningless and should follow the *Shiwen* in reading as *zī* (訾). The *Guanzi*’s *Jun Chen Shang* chapter states, 'Officials and stewards all have *zī cheng shi lü* (訾程事律),' which refers to this meaning of *zī*. Official ranks and social status must be measured by *zī cheng* (訾程). Thus, '*Zī* brothers' corresponds properly to the following 'nobility and baseness are like father and son.' Yin Jingshun did not grasp the meaning of *zī* and thought it should be the character for wealth, but then the following line should speak of poverty and wealth, not nobility and baseness.\"\n\n**Phonetic Annotation:** *Yan* (言) in the *Shiwen* is written as *zī* (訾), pronounced *jī yí*; it should be the character for wealth. Another version writes *yan* (言).\n\n—in talent, they are alike; in appearance, they are alike.

I am perplexed by this.\"\n\n**[Interpretation]:** Age, speech, talent, and appearance are similar, so they are called brothers. Longevity and early death, nobility and baseness are vastly different, so they are called father and son. This is the unknowability of fate, hence the perplexity.\n\nYangzi said: \"The ancients had a saying I once learned and shall now tell you.

The heart’s qi connects to the tongue, the spleen’s qi to the mouth, and the spleen’s vessels link to the tongue’s root. When pathogenic qi invades the organs and contends with the normal qi, speech is initiated and qi is stirred, allowing the pathogen to disrupt the proper vessels.

      "translated_text": "The *Shiwen* states: *Zhī lì* (只立) means solitary and self-reliant.\n\nFour people wander together in the world, each following their own aspirations; though they spend their whole lives without glancing at one another, each deems their own timing fitting. These are the manifold dispositions of the world. The *Shiwen* states: *Tài* (态) is pronounced *tā ài*.\n\nTheir appearances are not uniform—*qí* (其) was originally absent but has been added following the Jifu and Shidetang editions—and yet all are subsumed under the Dao, as destiny’s return. **[Exegesis]** That cunning, eloquence, foolishness, flattery, and integrity—these manifold dispositions—are all ascribed to destiny is a principle that cannot be so. Now, those who expound such views claim that the thickness or thinness of one’s received *qi* accounts for these differences, attributing all to Heaven without recourse—this is the ignorance of the unknowing.\n\nThus, those who know the Dao cultivate their spirit, preserve their authenticity, ease their concerns, and transform their bodies. Their physical forms are self-fashioned; they exert their conduct, shift their destinies—these are the splendid achievements of those who nurture life. Yet if one distinguishes destiny by form, then effort is inferior to destiny; if one verifies form by effort, then destiny is inferior to effort.\n\n*Guǐ guǐ chéng zhě* (佹佹成者) are those who *qiào* (俏) succeed. **[Annotation]** *Qiào* is pronounced *xiào*. *Qiào* means \"to resemble.\" Qin Enfu notes: Lu’s annotation reads *wēi wēi* (魏魏), differing from Zhang Zhan’s edition. Bo Jun observes: A *zhě* (者) may be missing after *qiào chéng* (俏成) to match the syntax below. The *Liushu Gu* (Six Writings) Volume 8 cites it correctly as *qiào chéng zhě yě* (俏成者也). The *Shiwen* states: *Guǐ* (佹) is pronounced *gū wēi*, denoting a near-desiring appearance. *Qiào* is identical to *xiào* (肖). Yet this is not true success. **[Exegesis]** *Wēi wēi* (魏魏) describes a near-desiring state. *Qiào* means \"to resemble.\" *Guǐ guǐ bài zhě* (佹佹败者) are those who *qiào* (俏) fail—yet this is not true failure.\n\n**[Annotation]** The world speaks of near-gains and near-losses, but in truth, there is no \"near.\" **[Exegesis]** One who nearly succeeds yet does not is like success but not success; one who nearly fails yet does not is like failure but not failure. The *Shiwen* states: *Jī* (几) is pronounced *qí*, the same below.\n\nThus, delusion arises from *qiào* (俏). **[Annotation]** Confusion stems from mistaking semblance for success or failure, unable to discern the source of delusion. Lu Wenchang notes: The annotation’s *yǐ* (以) appears as *sì* (似) in the Zang edition. At the juncture of *qiào* (俏), all is obscure. The *Shiwen* marks this as a sentence. If one is not obscure at the juncture of *qiào* (俏), **[Annotation]** *Jì* (际) means \"convergence,\" implying murky indistinction. **[Exegesis]** Human delusion arises from resemblance, from lack of clarity. Without clarity, all is obscure. If one discerns resemblance without obscurity, this is called illumination. Lu Wenchang notes: The Zang edition includes an *ér* (而) after *mèi* (昧) in the annotation.\n\nThen one is not startled by external misfortune—the *Shiwen* writes *hài* (骇) as *hài* (駴), stating it is identical to *hài* (骇)—nor delighted by inner fortune. **[Annotation]** Are misfortune and fortune truly internal or external? Both are the mysterious determinations of principle. Seeing their sudden emergence, one calls them external; seeing their gradual manifestation, one calls them internal. The *Shiwen* states: *Zú* (卒) is pronounced *cūn* (村) in the entering tone. One moves with the times, halts with the times—wisdom cannot fathom it. **[Annotation]** If movement and stillness are not of the self, then they are not discernible by wisdom. **[Exegesis]** The so-called illuminated one understands nature, comprehends the spirit, and knows that effort gives rise to life while destiny brings it to fruition. Thus, there is no external misfortune to fear, no inner fortune to rejoice in; movement and stillness follow the times, requiring no calculation by wisdom.\n\nThose who trust in destiny harbor no duality between self and other. **[Annotation]** They have no emotions of joy or fear. Those who harbor duality between self and other would do better to cover their eyes, plug their ears, turn their backs to slopes, and face moats without stumbling. **[Annotation]** This illustrates that relying on wisdom and planning is inferior to following nature. **[Exegesis]** If one can eliminate duality between self and other, then fortune and misfortune, regret and shame do not arise. If one cannot know destiny and follow principle, then preserving the body and avoiding harm is merely to escape collapse and stumbling.\n\nThus, the world does not forget striving for effort but cannot entrust itself to destiny. Lu Wenchang notes: The annotation’s *rú* (如) appears as *ruò* (若) in the Zang edition. The *Shiwen* writes *bèi bǎn* (背阪) as *bèi chéng* (背城) and *zhuì* (坠) as *duì* (队), stating: *Yǎn* (揜) is pronounced *yǎn*; *bèi chéng* (背城) appears as *bèi bǎn* (背阪) in one edition. *Duì* (队) is pronounced *zhuì* (坠), *pū* (仆) as *fù* (赴).\n\nThus it is said: Life and death follow destiny; poverty and hardship follow the times. **[Annotation]** If it were not for destiny, the benevolent and wise would surely live long, while the cruel and foolish would surely die young—but this is not necessarily so. **[Annotation]** If it were not for the times, the diligent and frugal would surely grow rich, while the extravagant and indolent would surely remain poor—but this is not necessarily so. **[Exegesis]** Zixia said: \"Life and death are a matter of destiny; wealth and honor rest with Heaven.\" \"Heaven\" here means \"the times.\" When yang warmth spreads its *qi*, all things are born; when the sage benefits from this and all beings flourish, this is called destiny, self-determined; when transformation reaches them, this is called the times. Lu Wenchang notes: The Zang edition includes a *yě* (也) at the end of the annotation. Tao Hongqing states: *Pín qióng* (贫穷) should be *pín fù* (贫富), aligning with the preceding \"life and death follow destiny.\" Zhang’s annotation suggests his edition originally read *pín fù* (贫富). The current text’s error stems from the following \"those who resent poverty.\" The *Shiwen* states: *Pín qióng zì shí yě* (贫穷自时也) appears as *fù guì zì shí yě* (富贵自时也) in one edition.\n\nThose who resent early death do not understand destiny; those who resent poverty do not understand the times. The *Shiwen* states: *Shé* (折) is pronounced *zhī shé*. **[Annotation]** These are all failures to recognize the principles of nature. Facing death without fear, enduring hardship without sorrow—this is knowing destiny and resting in the times. **[Exegesis]** Knowing destiny and resting in the times is the greatest virtue.",

      "translated_text": "When the times come, they cannot be shared; when destiny arrives, it cannot be refused. Thus it is said: rest in the times and dwell in compliance, and sorrow and joy cannot enter. Delusion arises from resemblance, and grief arises from not understanding the times.\n\nThose who are highly intelligent weigh advantages and harms, assess emptiness and fullness—*liào* (料) is pronounced *liáo*. They gauge human sentiments—*duó* (度) is pronounced *tuò luò*, as below. Whether they gain or lose, they hit the mark—*zhòng* (中) is pronounced *zhì chōng*, meaning \"half,\" as below. Some editions read *zhì zhòng*, which is incorrect.\n\n**[Annotation]** *Zhòng* means \"half.\"\n\nThose of little intelligence do not weigh advantages and harms, do not assess emptiness and fullness, do not gauge human sentiments. Whether they gain or lose, they still hit the mark. What difference is there between weighing and not weighing, assessing and not assessing, gauging and not gauging?\n\n**[Exegesis]** Generally, in assessing the affairs of the world, one who succeeds half the time must be skilled in assessment. Yet those of little intelligence, though they do not assess, also succeed half the time—what difference is there? Only when there is nothing measured—**[Annotation]** not employing intelligence—and nothing unmeasured—**[Annotation]** relying on what intelligence knows—is one whole and without loss—*wáng* (亡) is pronounced *wú*; *sàng* (丧) is pronounced *xī làng*, as below. Yet this is neither knowing wholeness—*zhī* (知) is pronounced *zhì*, as below in \"knowing loss\"—nor knowing loss. One is whole of oneself, lost of oneself, ruined of oneself.\n\n**[Annotation]** Being whole of oneself is not something the mind’s efforts can achieve; being ruined of oneself is not the result of misconduct.\n\n**[Exegesis]** Even if one toils the mind and strains the will, assessing with half success, it is still inferior to not assessing at all and preserving one’s life. Those who labor in thought do not understand destiny; those who measure nothing do not rely on their own strength. Not relying on strength is close to the Dao, so one abandons the former and adopts the latter.\n\nYu Yue says: The three characters \"自亡也\" (*zì wáng yě*) are likely superfluous. The preceding text states: \"Only when there is nothing measured and nothing unmeasured is one whole and without loss. This is neither knowing wholeness nor knowing loss.\" Here, it says, \"One is whole of oneself, ruined of oneself,\" which is sufficient in meaning. Adding \"lost of oneself\" disrupts the parallel with the earlier \"whole\" and \"loss.\" This redundancy likely arose from the three preceding instances of *wáng* (亡), all meaning \"nothing\" (無), not \"loss\" (丧亡).—*xíng* (行) is pronounced *xià mèng*.\n\nDuke Jing of Qi traveled to Ox Mountain. Ox Mountain is now in Linzi County of Beihai Prefecture. Looking north over his capital, he wept and said: \"How beautiful is this land! So lush and verdant—*qiān* (芊) is pronounced *qiān*. The *Guang Ya* states: *qiānqiān* means \"luxuriant.\" Why must I leave this land, flowing away in tears?\"—Lu Wenchang says: In the *Zang* edition, \"滴滴\" appears as \"□□.\"—*Dīdī* (滴滴) is also written as *pāngpāng*, both pronounced *pǔ láng*, meaning \"flowing abundantly.\" Ren Dachun says: For *pāngpāng*, it suffices to note the pronunciation *pǔ láng*; there is no need to say \"both pronounced.\" This means the main text’s *dī* and the variant *pāng* are both pronounced *pǔ láng*. However, *dī* has no such pronunciation. Consulting the *Xunzi*’s \"Fu Guo\" chapter, Yang Liang’s annotation reads: \"*Fāngfāng* (汸汸) is read as *pāng*, meaning 'abundant water.'\" Thus, *dī* may be a corruption of *fāng*.\n\nBo Jun notes: The *Liezi*’s *Shiwen* convention is that if character A should be character B, or if they share the same meaning, then B’s pronunciation is given, regardless of whether the two characters can be phonetically loaned. Below, it states: *xíng* (行) is glossed as *xiá* (暇), meaning *xíng* should be *hé* (何), not that *xíng* has the sound of *hé*. The same applies to *dī* and *pāng* sharing a pronunciation.\n\nRen’s argument is unclear.\n\n\"If the ancients never died, where would I go from here?\"—Lu Wenchang says: The *Han Shi Waizhuan* reads \"何之\" (*hé zhī*) instead of \"之何\" (*zhī hé*).\n\nShi, Kong, and Liangqiu Ju all wept alongside him—*Shǐ Kǒng* (史孔) is written as *Ài Kǒng* (艾孔) in one edition; *ài* is pronounced *wǔ gài*. They said: \"We rely on Your Lordship’s grace. Coarse grain and tough meat are ours to eat—*sū* (疏) is written as *guì* (跪) in one edition; *guì* should be *sū*. The *Han Shi Waizhuan* includes this entire passage, stating: 'Coarse grain and tough meat can be eaten.' Coarse grain means vegetables. We may ride broken-down horses and rickety carts—*nú* (驽) appears as *nù* (怒) in the *Shide Tang* edition. *Zhàn* (棱) should be *zhàn* (栈). The *Yanzi Chunqiu* and other texts all write *zhàn chē* (栈车), meaning carts made of woven wood. *Zhàn* is pronounced *shì xiàn*. Even so, we do not wish to die—how much less should our lord?\" Only Yanzi laughed to the side—*Yànzǐ* (晏子) is written as *Yàn Yīng* (晏婴); Yan Ying was from Yiwei in Lai.\n\nThe duke wiped his tears and turned to Yanzi—Bo Jun notes: The *Lüshi Chunqiu*’s \"Guan Biao\" chapter states: \"Wu Qi wiped his tears in response.\" Gao You’s annotation: \"*Xuě* (雪) means 'to wipe.'\" The *Kongzi Jiayu*’s \"Zilu Chujian\" chapter states: \"Millet is used to wipe the mortar.\" The annotation: \"*Xuě* means 'to wipe.'\"—and said: \"Today’s outing has saddened me.

The *Shiwen* glosses: *Xíng jiǎ* is pronounced *hé xiá*. Then how could our lord have attained this position and stand here? Because it is by turns occupied and relinquished. As for the lord alone weeping over it—this is unkind. Seeing an unkind lord and flattering ministers, I saw these two things, and this is why I alone secretly laughed.\"\n\nBo Jun notes: *Wéi* (为) means *yǐ* (以). \"The reason for laughing alone\" means \"the reason why I alone laughed.\" For further discussion, see Wang’s *Shici*.\n\nDuke Jing felt ashamed, raised his cup, and punished himself. He then penalized the two ministers, each with two cups. There was a man of Wei named Dongmen Wu whose son died, yet he did not grieve. Wang Shumin notes: The *Taiping Yulan* (518), *Jizuan Yuanhai* (48, 51), *Shiwen Leiju* (Later Collection 7), and *Hebi Shilei* (Former Collection 32) all include \"aged forty\" after \"there was a man.\" The phrase \"his son died, yet he did not grieve\" is rendered as \"he had a son whom he lost, yet he did not grieve.\"\n\nHis steward said: Bo Jun notes: The *Liji*’s \"Qu Li\" (Part II) states: \"A scholar does not refer to his steward or eldest concubine by name.\" *Xiàngshì* (相室) likely means *jiāxiàng* (家相), the one who assists in household affairs. The *Shiwen* glosses: *Xiàng* is pronounced *sì liàng*. \"Your lordship’s love for your son was unmatched in the world. Now that your son has died, why do you not grieve?\" Dongmen Wu replied: \"I once had no son. When I had no son, I did not grieve. Now that my son has died, it is the same as when I had no son before. Why should I grieve?\" Wang Chongmin notes: The *Jifu* edition reads *jù* (讵) instead of *chén* (臣), likely the original read *xī jù yōu yān* (奚巨忧焉). *Xī jù* is a compound, but readers, not grasping its meaning, altered it to place the emphasis on *xī* (奚). Bo Jun notes: The *Taiping Yulan* (518) reads: \"Then why should I grieve?\"\n\nThe farmer hurries to the season, the merchant hastens for profit, the artisan pursues his craft, and the official chases power—such is the force of circumstance. Yet the farmer faces drought and flood, the merchant meets gain and loss, the artisan encounters success and failure, and the official meets favor or rejection—such is the force of destiny.\n\n[Annotation] The workings of nature’s hidden course.\n[Exegesis] That scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants each pursue profit and chase power is what their strength can achieve. Drought and flood, success and failure, favor and rejection—these lie beyond their power, so they entrust themselves to destiny and find peace. This is like gathering the mulberry and elm without harming their protection. The world attributes what cannot be helped to destiny, yet those who do not strive are deluded by the semblance of attainment. Dongmen Wu was skilled at accepting destiny, not at understanding it. If the living have one who gives life, then one grasps that which creates one’s destiny; how then could one entrust destiny to the living? This is to grasp the principle of alternating presence and absence. One who understands destiny should entrust it to fate while applying one’s strength.\n\nQin Enfu notes: Lu’s annotation on the \"mulberry and elm\" sentence is unclear. Sun Yirang notes: The exegesis likely reads *sāng* (桑) for *sōu* (橾) and *yǔn huò* (陨获) for *sǔn hù* (损护), as seen in the *Liji*’s \"Ruxing\" chapter. Bo Jun notes: Based on Lu’s exegesis, it seems the *Chongxuan* edition connects \"the farmer hurries to the season\" to the preceding passage. However, judging by the meaning, \"the farmer hurries to the season\" and what follows form a separate section, summarizing the chapter’s theme, and thus remains set apart.",

      "translated_text": "[Annotation] Life is but a momentary gathering of qi, a fleeting spark of sentience in a single being. What is momentarily gathered must ultimately scatter; what is fleetingly sentient must return to emptiness. Yet to favor ease and detest labor is the constant nature of all things. Thus, what delights one in life amounts to nothing more than rich flavors, fine garments, beautiful forms, and enchanting sounds. Yet one cannot freely follow the inclinations of one’s nature or the pleasures of the senses, instead using benevolence and righteousness as bolts and ritual propriety as sashes, withering away in one’s prime while seeking a lingering reputation in posterity—this is to fail to grasp the joy of the ceaseless arising of life.\n\n[Exegesis] The noble person dies for fame, the petty person for profit. Fame and profit alike are what emotions drown in and the common crowd contends for. Thus, one who embodies the Dao does good without nearing fame, does not rush toward what the crowd competes for; does evil without nearing punishment, does not act in ways the crowd condemns. To violate the Dao in pursuit of fame or to drown in emotion in pursuit of desire is equally to lose the mean. Therefore, one who possesses the Dao does not dwell in such extremes. This passage seems contradictory, and scholars have often doubted it. Yet how does the chapter of Yang Zhu differ from that of Robber Zhi?\n\nThe *Shiwen* notes: Yang Zhu, some say his courtesy name was Ziju, was a man of the Warring States period, later than Mozi. Yang Zhu debated with Qin Guli, advocating self-love and refusing to pluck a single hair for the benefit of the world, opposing Mozi’s teachings. Lu Deming states, “Yang Rong’s courtesy name was Ziju,” suggesting Ziju was not Yang Zhu.\n\n*Hao* is pronounced *hūbào*; *wù* as *wūlù*; *fù* as *fúyòu*; *jiàn* sounds like *jiàn*; *jīn* as *jīn*; *gǎo* as *kǒulǎo*.\n\nLiang Yusheng remarks: In the *Zhuangzi*’s “Emperor of the North Sea,” Yang Ziju appears, and the *Shiwen* notes, “Li [Yi] says: *Ju* is his given name; *zi* is a general term for men.” Elsewhere, in the *Zhuangzi*’s “Words for All Occasions,” the *Shiwen* states, “His surname was Yang, given name Zhu, courtesy name Ziju,” where he engages in dialogue with Laozi. How then could he be identified as Yang Zhu?\n\nYang Jun notes: Whether Yang Zhu and Yang Ziju were the same person has long been debated. Wang Zhong, in his *Shuxue Laozi Kaoyi* appendix, argued they were two distinct figures, and later scholars like Tang Yue, in his *Yang Zhu Kao* (published in *Dongfang Zazhi*, vol. 22, no. 5), insisted Yang Zhu was not Yang Ziju. The view that they were two people is likely correct.\n\nYang Zhu traveled to Lu and lodged with the Meng family. Meng asked him, “One is merely human—why the need for fame?” Yang Zhu replied, “Fame is for wealth.” “Once wealthy, why not stop?” “For honor.” “Once honored, why not stop?” “For death.” “Once dead, what then?” “For descendants.”\n\n[Annotation] Since one’s affairs never cease, one’s desires are never sated.\n\nThe *Shiwen* notes: *Wéi fù*, *wéi guì*, *wéi sǐ*, *xī wéi yān*, and *wéi zǐsūn* are all pronounced with the *wěi* tone. *Yàn* is pronounced *yīyán*.\n\n“What benefit does fame bring to one’s descendants?” Yang Zhu replied, “Fame torments the body and scorches the heart.\n\n[Annotation] Fame is to seek the real through the false, to summon the substantial through the insubstantial, to act against one’s nature and force one’s conduct—how could it not entail the toil of anxiety?\n\nThe *Shiwen* notes: *Jiāo* is pronounced *jiāo*.\n\nYet those who ride upon fame bring blessings to their clans and benefits to their villages—how much more so to their descendants?”",

Furthermore, the lines ‘Once wealthy, why not cease? Once noble, why not cease?’ precisely describe those who, despite tormenting body and scorching heart, do not desist. Now, mistakenly omitted here, the preceding passage lacks full meaning, while this passage, discussing the benefits of fame, first presents its harms, disrupting the coherence of the argument.”\n\n“Those who pursue fame must be incorruptible; incorruptibility leads to poverty. Those who pursue fame must be yielding; yielding leads to lowliness.”\n\n[Annotation] This is the objection of a disputant. Now, those who possess the fame of incorruptibility and yielding yet cannot escape poverty and lowliness do so because they practice goodness without seeking profit.\n\n[Explication] In this worldly life, man is concerned only with fame and profit. The sage uses fame and profit as a hook: petty men die for profit, gentlemen die for fame—none fail to be ensnared. Though good and evil differ, both involve seeking. Yet those who seek fame and succeed not only attain wealth and nobility but bring glory to their descendants and benefit their villages. Though they torment the body, scorch the heart, and labor in incorruptibility and yielding, their aspirations have an object, and their passions forget themselves—both lose the mean.\n\nThe *Shiwen* notes: *Nàn* is pronounced *nǎidàn*.\n\nYang Zhu said: “When Guan Zhong served as minister to Qi,\n\nThe *Shiwen* notes: *Xiàng* is pronounced *xīliàng*; same below.\n\nthe lord was licentious, and so was he; the lord was extravagant, and so was he.”\n\n[Annotation] This means he did not claim sole credit for good or evil.\n\nBo Jun notes: The *Analects* (*Eight Rows of Dancers*) states: “Guan Zhong had three concubines, did not combine official duties, erected screen gates like a feudal lord, and set up a *fandian* for diplomatic banquets like a feudal lord.” All these are evidence of his licentiousness and extravagance.\n\n“Their aspirations aligned, their words followed one another, and their Dao was enacted, making the state hegemonic.

To pursue fame in order to gain profit while the world remains unaware—this is false fame. False fame is what secures profit.\n\nThe annotation “fame arises naturally” reads in the *Zang* edition as “yet arises naturally.”\n\nYu Yue remarks: After “If true fame leads to poverty, false fame brings wealth,” two sentences should follow: “true fame leads to lowliness, false fame brings nobility.” The preceding text states, “All who seek fame must be incorruptible, and incorruptibility leads to poverty; all who seek fame must be yielding, and yielding leads to lowliness.” Thus, the examples of Guan Zhong and the Tian clan are cited to prove that true fame results in poverty and lowliness, while false fame yields wealth and nobility.\n\nTao Hongqing states: Yu’s suggestion that two sentences—“true fame leads to lowliness, false fame brings nobility”—should be added is correct. However, his claim that this and the preceding discussion of Guan Zhong and the Tian clan form a single argument is mistaken.

The disputant’s intent here is that \"true\" refers to genuine fame, while \"false\" refers to something other than fame. The subsequent response states, “Truth has no fame, fame has no truth; fame is but falsity.” This means that truth and fame cannot coexist—once something is called fame, it is all falsity with no truth, which would imply that fame indeed leads to wealth and nobility.

The following response explicitly marks its beginning with *yue* (“it is said”) to distinguish it, leaving no doubt that this is the disputant’s objection.

The contrast between Yao and Shun on the one hand, and Boyi and Shuqi on the other, is thus luminously clear. Are the traces of truth and falsity not easily discerned? If worldly people do not lose their authenticity in pursuit of fame and profit, they will drown in passions and desires, forgetting the Dao.\n\nThe good are few in the world, while the unvirtuous are many; thus, those who chase reputation are rare, while those who follow desire are legion. Even the wise can do nothing about this, for all have lost the mean.\n\nThe *Shiwen* notes: *Shěng* is read *sī jǐng qiē*.\n\nYang Zhu said: \"A hundred years is the utmost limit of longevity.\" The *Shiwen* notes: *Qí* is read in the falling tone, meaning \"limit.\" Among a thousand, not one attains a hundred years. The *Shiwen* reads *wú* as *wáng*, glossing it: \"pronounced *wú*.\" Even if one such person exists, from infancy to senility, nearly half their years are spent thus. The *Shiwen* notes: *Jǐ* is pronounced *qí*; same below.\n\nOf the remaining half, sleep at night erases some, and waking hours squander others. The *Shiwen* notes: *Mǐ* is read *mián bì qiē*; *jué* is pronounced *jiào*. Pain, illness, sorrow, and suffering—loss, anxiety, and fear—consume yet another half. Lu Wenchang notes: The *Yilin* quotes \"pain and illness\" as \"illness and disease.\" Wang Shumin notes: The *Wen Xuan*’s commentary on Lu Ji’s \"Long Song\" also reads \"illness and disease.\"\n\nMeasuring within these ten-odd years, how rarely does one find a moment of carefree contentment, free from the slightest concern? The *Shiwen* notes: *Wáng* is pronounced *wú*; same below. *Jiè* is pronounced *jiè*, meaning \"subtle.\" Such moments last but an instant. What, then, is the purpose of human life? What joy does it bring? The *Shiwen* notes: *Lè* is pronounced *luò*.\n\nIt is for fine food and rich pleasures— The *Shiwen* notes: *Wéi* is read *yú wěi qiē*—for sensual delights.

      "translated_text": "The pleasures of this life are not to be forsaken—Yu Yue notes: *\"Dāng shēn\"* (\"this life\") is an error for *\"dāng shēng\"* (\"present life\"). Below, it states, *\"The reputation after death is not to be sought,\"* and *\"dāng shēng\"* directly opposes *\"sǐ hòu\"* (\"after death\"). Further on, it says, *\"Moreover, hasten to the present life—why rush to consider the afterlife?\"*—this serves as proof. *Shiwen* notes: *\"Qù\"* is pronounced *qiū lǚ*. Thus, one is not swayed by the lure of reputation. The annotation reads: *\"Those who do good without drawing near to fame.\"*\n\nThe Northern Song edition, Wang’s edition, and the *Four Explications* edition write *\"guān\"* (\"observe\") for *\"quàn\"* (\"exhort\"), but here we follow the Jifu edition, the *Daoist Canon* unannotated edition, and the Shidetang edition in correcting it. *Shiwen* notes: *\"Quàn\"* has a variant reading as *\"guān.\"*\n\nFollowing one’s nature in wandering, one does not oppose the desires of the myriad things. The reputation after death is not to be sought, so one does not incur punishment. The annotation reads: *\"Those who do evil without drawing near to punishment.\"* Bo Jun notes: Not opposing the desires of the myriad things means not offending others; not offending others means not doing evil, hence one does not incur punishment. Zhang’s annotation touches on this but does not elaborate. *Shiwen* notes: *\"Jìn\"* is read in the falling tone, and so below. *\"Xíng\"* means harm.\n\nFame and reputation, whether early or late, and the length of one’s lifespan are not matters to be measured. The exegesis states: To cite the people of the great antiquity is to suit the mean. That which is born and dies is form; that which emerges into life and enters death is spirit. Knowing that life and death are but fleeting arrivals and departures, one does not urgently seek fame; knowing that spirit is neither born nor dies, one does not anxiously strive for the Dao. Thus, one acts from the heart without resisting what nature favors. One delights in the body alone—what use is there for fame? Thus, one wanders in accord with one’s nature without opposing the desires of the myriad things. One is content in the moment alone—what fear is there of punishment? Therefore, fame, reputation, and lifespan are not matters to be calculated.\n\nThose who delight in the body and are content in the moment move in harmony with the Dao, not drowning in emotion. Yang Zhu said: \"What differs among the myriad things is life; what is the same is death. In life, there are the worthy and the foolish, the noble and the base—this is what differs. In death, there is putrefaction and dissolution—this is what is the same. Though this be so, worthiness and foolishness, nobility and baseness are not within one’s power; putrefaction and dissolution are also not within one’s power. Thus, life is not what one lives, death is not what one dies; worthiness is not what one makes worthy, foolishness is not what one makes foolish, nobility is not what one makes noble, baseness is not what one makes base.\" The annotation reads: All these are natural, not what one’s power can effect.\n\nBo Jun notes: After *\"gù shēng fēi suǒ shēng\"* (\"thus, life is not what one lives\"), the character *\"néng\"* (\"power\") is likely omitted below each *\"suǒ\"* (\"what\"). These phrases closely follow *\"xián yú guì jiàn fēi suǒ néng yě, chòu fǔ xiāo miè yì fēi suǒ néng yě\"* (\"worthiness and foolishness, nobility and baseness are not within one’s power; putrefaction and dissolution are also not within one’s power\"). A careful reading of Zhang’s annotation and Lu’s exegesis below suggests that the editions they consulted all included *\"néng.\"*\n\nYet the myriad things are equal in life and equal in death, equal in worthiness and equal in foolishness, equal in nobility and equal in baseness. The annotation reads: All return equally to nature. Whether ten years or a hundred years, all die. The benevolent and sagely die, the cruel and foolish die. In life, they may be Yao and Shun; in death, they are but rotting bones. In life, they may be Jie and Zhou; in death, they are but rotting bones. The bones rot the same—who knows the difference? Moreover, hasten to the present life—why rush to consider the afterlife? The annotation reads: This mocks those who calculate the afterlife in their delusion.\n\nOne who does not scheme for the past, does not worry for the future, and has no attachment to the present—this is the perfection of virtue. The exegesis states: Life is the retribution of this body; death is the exhaustion of this retribution. Worthiness and foolishness, nobility and baseness are the distinctions of living things—hence they differ. Putrefaction and dissolution are the constants of dead things—hence they are the same. The world points to form as life and death, unaware of the spirit beyond form. When the spirit departs, it is as if all knowledge ceases. Thus, worthiness and foolishness, nobility and baseness, putrefaction and dissolution are not what form itself can effect. If not self-effected, then the substance of all living things has never not been equal. People know what is equal but not why they differ. Moreover, they compete in the present life and have no leisure to nurture what gives them life—thus those who possess the Dao do not conform to this.\n\nYang Zhu said: \"Bo Yi did not lack desire—his error lay in his pride in purity, leading him to starve to death.\" The annotation reads: He clung to starvation until death. *Shiwen* notes: The *Gongyang Commentary* states: *\"Fàng sǐ bù lì\"* (\"He starved to death without establishing himself\"). Liu Zhao’s annotation reads: *\"Fàng\"* means \"to the utmost.\" Zhan Ji did not lack emotion—his error lay in his pride in integrity, leading him to diminish his lineage. *Shiwen* notes: *\"Guǎ zōng\"* means \"few in lineage.\" How mistaken is this error of purity and integrity! The annotation reads: These are words that slander the worthy and betray reality, yet to convey praise or blame, one cannot but place responsibility on those of lofty virtue.\n\nThe exegesis states: The excess of pursuing fame truly reaches this point—this is not how one embodies the truth, perfects the Dao, forgets fame, and attains reality. Yang Zhu said: \"Yuan Xian was impoverished in Lu.\" Bo Jun notes: *\"Jù\"* should be *\"jù.\"* The *Shuowen*, *Yupian*, *Guangyun*, *Jiyun*, and *Yunhui* all write *\"jù,\"* not *\"jǔ.\"* The *Leipian* writes *\"jǔ.\"* The *Jiyun* also includes *\"jǔ,\"* glossing it as *\"ōu jù.\"* It is suspected that those writing *\"jǔ\"* were all later scholars from the Tang onward, for before the Tang, there was no character *\"jǔ.\"*",

      "translated_text": "The *Poetry*’s \"Bei Men\" states, \"Ever impoverished and poor,\" while the *Erya* glosses *jù* as \"poverty.\" The *Classic of Rites* reads, \"The host declines with *jù*,\" and the *Xunzi*’s \"Questions of Yao\" says, \"Thus they are petty and *jù*.\" All instances of *jù* should be written as *jù*.\n\nThe *Exegesis on Texts* notes: *Jù* is pronounced *qíyǔ*. Zigong engaged in commerce in Wei.\n\nThe annotation explains: *Jù* means poverty; *zhí* refers to mercantile pursuits. Yuan Xian’s poverty harmed his life, while Zigong’s commerce burdened his person.\n\nThe *Exegesis on Texts* adds: *Lèi* is read in the departing tone.\n\n\"Then neither poverty nor commerce is acceptable—where, then, does the acceptable lie?\"\n\nThe *Exegesis on Texts* notes: *Yān* is pronounced *yúqián*.\n\nThe reply: \"The acceptable lies in delighting in life, the acceptable lies in easing the body. Thus, one who delights in life is not impoverished—\"\n\nThe annotation explains: \"He suffices in what sustains him and does not fall into want.\"\n\n\"—and one who eases the body does not engage in commerce.\"\n\nThe annotation explains: \"He does not labor his mind to amass wealth.\"\n\nThe exegesis states: Clinging to poverty without striving harms life; pursuing commerce for sustenance burdens the body. Only the man of the Dao neither chases wealth to ease his body nor clings to poverty to afflict his life. Delighting in the Dao and preserving reality, he responds to things without obstruction.\n\nYang Zhu said: \"An ancient saying goes: *'In life, we cherish one another; in death, we abandon one another.'*\"\n\nBo Jun notes: *Juān* in ancient pronunciation belonged to the *wen* rhyme group, while *lián* belonged to the *zhen* group. Their rhyming in antiquity was most proximate; here, *juān* and *lián* form a rhyme.\n\nThe *Exegesis on Texts* writes *juān* as *sǔn*, glossing it: pronounced *juān*.\n\n\"This saying is perfect. The way of cherishing one another is not merely about sentiment: diligence can bring ease, hunger can bring satiety, cold can bring warmth, and poverty can bring success. The way of abandonment is not that one feels no sorrow: one does not hold pearls and jades in the mouth—\"\n\nThe *Exegesis on Texts* notes: *hán* is pronounced *hàn*.\n\n\"—does not dress in brocade, does not display sacrificial animals, does not arrange funerary objects.\"\n\nThe exegesis states: Knowing that the ways of cherishing and abandonment are perfect, yet none can attain them—why? Cherishing lies in providing for life, abandonment in freeing the form from burdens; this is the height of propriety. If in life one cannot ensure another’s peace but in death merely buries jewels to flaunt fame, inviting bandits to inflict further harm, one has lost all sense of what is fitting.\n\nYan Pingzhong asked Guan Yifu about nurturing life. Guan Yifu replied: \"Let it flow freely—do not dam or obstruct it.\"\n\nThe *Exegesis on Texts* notes: *Yōng* is pronounced *yǒng*; *è* is pronounced *āngě*, identical to *è*.\n\nYan Pingzhong asked: \"What does this entail in practice?\"\n\nYifu said: \"Indulge the ears in what they wish to hear, the eyes in what they wish to see, the nose in what it desires to smell, the mouth in what it wishes to say, the body in what it desires for comfort, and the will in what it wishes to pursue.\"\n\nThe annotation explains: Guan Zhong’s fame resounded in his time; as minister to Qi, he achieved hegemony through power and strategy. The way of effortless action was hardly fitting for him, nor did circumstances permit such words. Moreover, in the previous chapter, he urged Duke Huan to visit the northern lands at life’s end—this is likely all allegory.\n\nThe *Exegesis on Texts* notes: *Xiàng* is pronounced *xīliàng*; *fù* is pronounced *fúyòu*.",

If it were governed by me, one would indulge passion to seek joy—this is what worldly people mean when they say following desire is noble. If this were so, Yao, Shun, the Duke of Zhou, and Confucius would not be esteemed by common folk, while Jie, Zhou, and Robber Zhi could serve as teachers for later generations. How could this be the conduct of those who embody the Dao? The perfected person forgets passion; the sage regulates it with ritual. When passion is forgotten, cravings no longer exist—how then could one be ensnared by sounds and sights? When ritual is established, the traces of life and death become manifest—how then could one treat cremation and exposure lightly? Indulging passion in such ways is to lose the Dao.\n\nThe *Shiwen* notes: *Jin* (advance) is pronounced *jin*.\n\nWhen Zichan served as minister of Zheng, the *Shiwen* notes: Zichan was Gongsun Qiao, a grandee of Zheng. He cast penal laws onto tripods, an event recorded in the sixth year of Duke Zhao. *Xiang* (minister) is pronounced *siang*. He monopolized the governance of the state. After three years, the virtuous submitted to his transformation, while the wicked feared his prohibitions, and Zheng was well governed. The *Shiwen* notes: *Zhi* (govern) is pronounced *zhi*; the same applies to *zhi* in \"well governed\" below. The feudal lords stood in awe of him.\n\nHe had an elder brother named Gongsun Chao, the *Shiwen* notes: *Chao* follows the given name. And a younger brother named Gongsun Mu. Chao was fond of wine, the *Shiwen* notes: *Hao* (fond) is pronounced *haow*. Mu was fond of women. Chao’s residence stored a thousand *zhong* of wine—this follows the *Sijie*, *Jifu*, and other editions; the Northern Song edition reads \"钟,\" followed by Wang’s edition and the *Shide Tang* edition. The *Shucao* (148), *Leiyuan* (497, 846), *Shilei Fu* (17), *Jizuan Yuanhai* (90), and *Tianzhong Ji* (29) all cite it as *zhong*. Fermented grains piled into mounds, the *Shiwen* notes: Another version reads *qu* (grain). The *Shiwen* reads *wang* (reach), pronounced *wang*. The stench of lees and dregs assailed the nose for a hundred paces beyond the gate. Chen notes: The *Guangya*’s *Shigu* states, \"Wang means to reach.\" The *Daozang* unannotated edition and Lin Xiyi’s edition both read \"醴\" (sweet wine) instead of \"糟\" (lees), but \"糟\" is the superior reading here. The *Shiwen* reads \"醴浆\" (sweet wine), noting: *Li* is pronounced *zao*; another version reads *zao* (lees).\n\nWhen he was lost in drink, he knew nothing of the state’s safety or peril, of human affairs’ regrets or resentments, the *lin* (regrets) in the Northern Song edition is written as \"\", followed by Wang’s edition and the *Zang* and *Qin* editions; this follows the *Shide Tang* edition. Of his household’s gains or losses, the *Shiwen* notes: *Wang* (loss) is pronounced *wu*. Of the closeness or distance of his nine clans, or the sorrow and joy of life and death. The *Shiwen* notes: *Le* (joy) is pronounced *luo*. Even if water, fire, or blades assailed him, he remained unaware.\n\nMu’s rear chambers adjoined dozens of rooms, the *Shiwen* notes: *Bi* (adjoin) is pronounced *bi*. All were filled with young, graceful women, the *Shiwen* notes: *Wo* is pronounced *woguo*. *Nu* is pronounced *nuo*. When he was immersed in sensuality, the *dan* (immersed) in the Northern Song, *Jifu*, and *Shide Tang* editions is written as \"聃\"; the same applies to \"耽于嗜欲\" below. The *Shiwen* notes: *Dan* is another version of \"\", pronounced *dinnan*. Ren Dachun states: The *Yupian* and *Leipian* lack the character \"\", but include \"\", a variant of \"\", meaning joy. The \"\" in the *Shiwen*’s \"another version reads \"\" is a corruption of \"\". He cast aside close kin, the *Shiwen* notes: *Bing* (cast aside) is pronounced in the upper tone. *Ni* (close) is pronounced *nizhi*. Severed friendships, and fled to the rear chambers to indulge day and night. The *Shiwen* notes: *Zu* (indulge) is pronounced *jizhu*, meaning to add. Chen notes: The *Guangyun*’s *Yu* rhyme states, \"*Zu* means to augment,\" thus it should be read in the departing tone. He emerged only once every three months, yet still felt unsatisfied. The *Shiwen* notes: *Qie* (satisfied) is pronounced *koudie*. If there were a maiden of surpassing beauty in the village, the *Shiwen* notes: *E* (beauty) is pronounced *e*. *Jiao* (loveliness) is pronounced *jiao*; the *Guangya* states it means \"fine.\" He would bribe and summon her, the *Shiwen* notes: *Hui* (bribe) is pronounced *huiwei*. Employ matchmakers to entice her. The *Shiwen* notes: *Tiao* (entice) is pronounced *tiaoyao*. The *Cangjie Pian* states: *Tiao* means to beckon. The *Shuowen* writes it as *tiao* (誂), meaning to lure. *Tiao* is pronounced *dialiao*. He would not cease until he obtained her. Chen notes: The character \"弗\" (not) may be superfluous or a corruption of \"必\" (must).\n\nZichan grieved over this day and night. Secretly, he sought Deng Xi’s counsel, the *Shiwen* notes: *Zao* (sought) is written as \"速\" (hurried), noting: The original reads *zao*, pronounced *qidao*. *Xi* is pronounced *xi*. Saying: “I have heard that governing the self extends to the family, and governing the family extends to the state—this speaks of proceeding from the near to the far. I have governed the state well, yet my family is in chaos. Is my Way perverse? How should I save these two sons? Please instruct them!” Deng Xi replied: “I have long found this strange but dared not speak first. Why not govern them in due time, enlightening them on the weight of life and fate, and enticing them with the dignity of ritual and righteousness?”\n\n[Exegesis] Enlightening them on life and fate, enticing them with ritual and righteousness—this aims to curb their indulgent passions, tempting them with the allure of high rank and eminence, which are the ultimate goals of worldly fame and profit.\n\nZichan followed Deng Xi’s advice. Taking advantage of an opportunity, he visited his brothers and addressed them, the *Shiwen* notes: *Jian* (opportunity) is pronounced *jian*. Saying: “What makes humans noble above beasts is wisdom and foresight. What wisdom and foresight guide is ritual and righteousness. When ritual and righteousness are perfected, fame and position follow. If you act on impulse, indulging in desires, your life and fate will be imperiled.”",

Hence, the likes of Wangsun were reproved by good officials for losing the middle Way.\n\nGuan Yiwu turned to Bao Shu Huangzi and said, “As for the Way of life and death, we two have advanced in it.”",

One has no leisure to fret over the disgrace of reputation or the peril of life and fate.\n\nMoreover, do you intend to flaunt your governance skills to impress others, to use specious words to disturb my heart, to delight my mind with rank and emolument? Is this not base and pitiable? I would further distinguish this from your way.\n\nOne who excels at governing the external may not bring order to things but will exhaust himself; one who excels at governing the internal may not bring chaos to things but will harmonize his nature.

The governance of Zheng was merely coincidental, not your achievement.”\n\n*[Annotation:]*\nNot knowing a true person, one cannot govern a state; governance is but a matter of chance.\n\nThis entire passage is too blunt and confrontational in its rhetoric, lacking the tone of a gentleman. Yet its intent is to relieve the burdens of those who constrain themselves, hence its excessively unrestrained words.\n\n*[Exegesis:]*\nWhen rewards are given according to ability and appointments made by virtue, the worthy advance day by day while the unworthy retreat. If appointments are made solely by talent, the Way of the good prospers; if the unworthy are inevitably dismissed, the Way of the petty incurs no resentment. Let the worthy and unworthy each settle into their proper place and fulfill their aspirations, and the governance of Zheng will be fitting.\n\nThose two men indulged in wine and sensual pleasures, neglecting ritual and righteousness. They did not rely on the influence of fathers and elder brothers to seize opportunities, but followed their desires without remorse—these were truly true persons. Yet you sought to correct their conduct and feign their intentions, seizing emoluments and rank for private gain. That the state happened to be well-ordered was no credit to your impartiality—how could this be called wisdom?\n\nHere, “true person” does not refer to a truly sagely individual, but to one who is genuinely without talent.\n\n*[Annotation:]*\nThe character *tai* (太) in the *Shidetang* edition appears as *da* (大).\n\nLu Wenchang notes: In the *Zhuangzi*, the phrase “jingting” (径挺) appears as “jingting” (径庭) or “jingtin” (俓侹).\n\nQin Enfu observes: In the exegesis, “wei qi xin” (为其心), *wei* (为) and *wei* (伪) were interchangeable in ancient script. Yang Liang’s commentary on the *Xunzi*’s “Xing’e” chapter states: “‘Wei’ means ‘to do’ or ‘to feign.’ Anything not of innate nature but contrived by humans is called *wei*. Thus, the character *wei* (伪) combines *ren* (人) and *wei* (为), forming a compound ideograph.”\n\nThe *Shiwen* renders “jingting” (径挺) as “jingtin” (径廷), with *ting* (廷) pronounced *ting* (听). *Kang* (抗) is pronounced *kang* (苦浪切). *Qu* (去) is pronounced *qǔ* (丘吕切). *Lei* (累) is read in the falling tone.\n\nWei’s Duanmu Shu was a descendant of Zigong. *[Exegesis by Bo Jun:]* The *Strategies of Qin* states: “Marshlands can be bequeathed to posterity,” with the annotation: “‘Posterity’ refers to later generations.” The *Discourses of Jin* reads: “Without virtue, one does not reach the age,” with the annotation: “‘Age’ means succession.” Thus, “descendant of Zigong” refers to Zigong’s posterity. Below, it says “relying on his ancestral wealth,” meaning he relied on Zigong’s wealth, for Zigong was skilled in commerce.

      "translated_text": "The household amassed wealth of ten thousand gold. He paid no heed to worldly affairs, indulging whatever he fancied. As the *Shiwen* notes: *hao* (好, “fancy”) is pronounced *hu bao*, and the same applies below. Whatever the people desired to do, whatever the human heart longed to enjoy—nothing was left undone, nothing left unindulged. Walls and houses, terraces and pavilions, gardens and parks, ponds and pools, food and drink, carriages and robes, music and concubines—he rivaled the lords of Qi and Chu. As for what his nature craved, what his ears longed to hear, his eyes to see, his mouth to taste—even if it came from distant lands or remote regions (the commentary notes: *pian*, 偏, means “remote”), or was not native to Qi, he spared no effort to obtain it. Yu Yue observes: The passage below reads, “Though mountains and rivers barred the way, though paths stretched long and far, nothing was left unvisited,” so this passage should read “nothing was left unobtained,” with the extra *zhi* (之) being an erroneous interpolation. Yet to him, such things were as readily at hand as objects within a garden fence. The *Shiwen* writes *fan* (藩) as *fan* (蕃), glossing it *fu yuan*. Ren Dachun notes: The *Zhouli*’s *Da Situ* commentary states, “Du Zichun reads *fan yue* (蕃樂) as *fan yue* (藩樂).” The *Shi*’s “Breaking willows for the garden fence” has the *Shiwen* gloss: “*Fan* (樊) means *fan* (藩), and is also written *fan* (蕃).” The *Han Yi*’s *Shiwen* concurs. The *Zuozhuan*’s twenty-eighth year *Shiwen* reads, “*Fan* (藩) is also written *fan* (蕃).” The *Chu Yu* states, “They made for it gates and bolts, *fan li* (蕃籬),” with Wei Zhao’s commentary: “*Fan li* (蕃籬) means walls and enclosures; *fan li* (蕃籬) is the same as *fan li* (藩籬),” showing that *fan* (藩) and *fan* (蕃) are interchangeable.\n\nWhen he traveled, though mountains and rivers barred the way (the *Shiwen* writes *zu xian* (阻險) as *ju yan* (岨崄), noting that *ju* (岨) is the same as *zu* (阻), and *yan* (崄) the same as *xian* (險)), though paths stretched long and far, nothing was left unvisited—it was as effortless as taking a single step. The *Shiwen* glosses *zhi* (咫) as *zhi* (紙). Guests filled his courtyard daily by the hundreds. Yu Yue states: *Zhu* (住) should be *shu* (數), a phonetic error. The *Huangdi* chapter reads: “The flocking birds arrived by the hundreds without cease,” with Zhang’s commentary: “*Zhu* (住) should be *shu* (數),” confirming this. This passage in Lu Chongxuan’s edition reads *wang* (往), which is a mistaken character. The *Shiwen* notes: *Zhu* (住) is pronounced *se zhu*, and is also written *wang* (往). Smoke never ceased rising from his kitchens (the *Shiwen* writes *pao* (庖) as *bao* (胞), glossing it *pu jiao*, and noting it is also written *pao* (庖)). Ren Dachun observes: The *Kao Ji Tong* states, “*Bao* (胞) refers to the lowliest of meat-officials,” with the commentary: “*Bao* (胞) means *pao* (庖).” The *Zhuangzi*’s “Gengsang Chu” chapter reads: “Thus Tang used *bao* (胞) and *chu* (厨) to ensnare Yi Yin.” The *Hanshu*’s *Dongfang Shuo Zhuan* reads: “*Bao* (胞) official Yin Yan,” with Yan Shigu’s commentary: “*Bao* (胞) and *pao* (庖) share the same meaning,” showing that *pao* (庖) and *bao* (胞) are interchangeable. Music never ceased playing in his halls and corridors. The *Shiwen* glosses *wu* (庑) as *wu* (武).\n\nWhat remained after his own provision was first distributed to his clan; what remained after the clan was next distributed to his village; what remained after the village was then distributed throughout the state. At sixty years of age, his *qi* and vigor waning, he abandoned his household affairs, dispersing all his storehouses, treasures, carriages, robes, concubines, and attendants. Within a year, he exhausted it all, leaving no wealth for his descendants. The *Shiwen* glosses *wei* (為) as *yu wei* (于偽). When he fell ill, he had no store of medicines or stones; when he died, he had no resources for burial. The commentary notes: One who grasps the Dao understands the impermanence of all things and the fleeting nature of wealth. Its accumulation is not one’s own achievement, so one fulfills the proper measure of provision; its dispersal is not one’s own gift, so one clarifies that things do not permanently gather. Such a person—how could mere fame or ritual and law restrain him? The *Shiwen* glosses *shi* (施) as *shi chi* (始豉), and the same applies below.\n\nThose in the state who received his gifts—Wang Chongmin notes: The *Taiping Yulan* (493) omits *ren* (人) after *zhi* (之)—joined together to contribute and bury him. Yu Yue states: *Fu* (賦) means calculating by household to raise funds. The *Zhouli*’s *Da Zai* commentary by Zheng Xuan reads: “*Fu* (賦) means a per-person levy of coin.” The *Hanshu*’s *Shi Huo Zhi*, in Yan Shigu’s commentary, reads: “*Fu* (賦) means calculating by household to raise wealth,” which clarifies its meaning. *Zang* (藏) here means burial, as in the *Liji*’s “Tan Gong” chapter: “Burial is *zang* (藏),” so *zang* (葬) and *zang* (藏) are interchangeable. The *Yi Jing*’s *Xi Ci Zhuan* reads: “Buried in the wilds,” while the *Hanshu*’s *Liu Xiang Zhuan* quotes it as “*Zang* (臧) in the wilds,” with *zang* (臧) being the same as *zang* (藏). Since Duanmu Shu had no resources for burial, those who received his gifts pooled their contributions to bury him, returning his descendants’ wealth to them.\n\nQin Gu (the commentary notes: also written Qu Li) heard of this and said: “Duanmu Shu was a madman, bringing shame upon his ancestors.” Duangan Sheng heard of it and said: “Duanmu Shu was an enlightened man, his virtue surpassing that of his ancestors. Wang Chongmin notes: The *Taiping Yulan* (493) writes *Duangan Sheng* (段干生) as *Duangan Mu* (段干木), which should be followed. The *Shiwen* glosses *guo* (過) as *ge* (戈). What he did, what he pursued, shocked the common mind, yet was affirmed by true principle. The gentlemen of Wei, who rigidly upheld ritual and teaching, were fundamentally incapable of understanding such a man’s heart.”\n\nMeng Sunyang asked Yang Zhu: “Suppose there were a man here who valued life and cherished his body, seeking immortality—would that be possible?” The *Shiwen* glosses *qi* (蕲) as *qi* (祈), and Yang Zhu replied: “In principle, there is no immortality.”",

We have heard of these things, seen them, and experienced them.\n\n[Lu's note] *Geng* (更) means to undergo or experience. The *Records of the Grand Historian*, in the \"Biographies of Dayuan,\" states: \"The Han, then intent on destroying the Hu, upon hearing these words, wished to establish communication. The route would necessarily pass through the Xiongnu.\" The *Suoyin* commentary explains: \"*Geng* means to traverse.\" The word applies equally to the traversal of a journey and the experience of life.\n\n[Shiwen] *Geng* is pronounced *geng* (庚).\n\nA hundred years would still feel too long—how much more the suffering of long life?”\n\n[Note] The experiences of a single lifetime are thus: now love, now hate; now safety, now peril, like an endless cycle. If one were to consider this joy? Then the return of what has already come would bring no renewed delight. If one were to consider this suffering? Then the afflictions of the self cannot be endured again. Thus, the longer one lives, the more sorrows accumulate.\n\n[Shiwen] *Chong* (重) is pronounced *zhong* (柱用切); *fu* (复) is pronounced *fu* (扶又切).\n\nMeng Sunyang said: “If that is so, then swift death is preferable to long life. In that case, to tread upon blades or plunge into boiling water would achieve one’s aim.”",

The gentlemen of Wei, who rigidly upheld ritual and teaching, were fundamentally incapable of understanding such a man’s heart.”\n\nMeng Sunyang asked Yang Zhu: “Suppose there were a man here who valued life and cherished his body, seeking immortality—would that be possible?” The *Shiwen* glosses *qi* (蕲) as *qi* (祈), and Yang Zhu replied: “In principle, there is no immortality.”",

Thus, *bi* (蔽) may be pronounced *bi* (敝) or *bei* (卑).

      "translated_text": "The *Shiwen* notes that \"纵\" is written as \"从\", reading *cong* as *zong*, and the same applies below. They did not afflict themselves with ritual and righteousness, living in carefree abandon until their execution: these were the most dissolute of men under Heaven.\n\nThose two tyrants, in life, enjoyed the pleasures of indulging their desires; in death, bore the name of folly and violence. In truth, such men are fundamentally untouched by reputation. Though slandered, they knew it not; though praised, they knew it not. Yu Yue notes: The preceding text speaks of Shun, Yu, the Zhou, and Confucius, saying, \"Though praised, they knew it not; though rewarded, they knew it not.\" Thus, in discussing Jie and Zhou, it should read, \"Though slandered, they knew it not; though punished, they knew it not.\" \"Slandered\" pairs with \"praised,\" and \"punished\" with \"rewarded,\" aligning with the later passage: \"Those four sages, though the destination of all praise; those two tyrants, though the destination of all blame.\" \"Praised and rewarded\" are the destination of praise; \"slandered and punished\" are the destination of blame. Here, following the earlier text by also using \"praised\" renders the meaning incoherent. How do they differ from clods of earth?\n\n**[Annotation]** They exhausted the extremes of arrogance and extravagance, indulging their insatiable natures. Though nourished by all under Heaven, they never found contentment in their hearts. This was truly a life of year-long suffering and distress. The *Shiwen* notes: *Jin* (尽) is read as *zǐrěn*; *yàn* (厌) as *yīyán*; *qiè* (惬) as *kǒutiē*.\n\nThose four sages, though the destination of all praise, toiled to the end of their days, and all alike met death. Those two tyrants, though the destination of all blame, reveled to the end of their days—*Shiwen* notes: *lè* (乐) is read as *luò*—and likewise all met death.\n\nYang Zhu met with the King of Liang. Speaking of governing the realm, he said it was as easy as turning one’s palm. Wang Chongmin notes: *Leiju* 94 cites this as \"King Hui of Liang,\" and the following \"the King said\" omits the word \"Liang.\" Wang Shumin notes: *Shilei Fu* 22 includes the word \"初\" before \"Yang Zhu.\" *Wen Xuan* commentary on Dongfang Manqian’s *Response to a Guest’s Objections*, *Shiwen Leiju* (later collection) 39, *Yunfu Qunyu* 6, and *Tianzhong Ji* 54 all include the word \"Hui\" after \"Liang.\"\n\nThe King said: \"Sir, you cannot even govern one wife and one concubine, nor tend three *mu* of garden; yet you claim governing the realm is as easy as turning your palm. Why is this?\" Yang Zhu replied: \"Have you seen those who herd sheep? Wang Chongmin notes: The words \"见其\" are reversed in error. *Leiju* 94 writes \"其\" as \"夫,\" which also works (*Shuo Yuan*’s *Zhengli* chapter reads: \"Have you not seen the sheep?\"). Bo Jun’s note: *Qi* (其) means *bi* (彼). 'Have you seen those who herd sheep?' is akin to 'Have you seen *those* who herd sheep?' The use of *qi* to mean *bi* is explained in Zhongfu’s *Advanced Chinese Grammar* and *Word Explications*. A hundred sheep in a flock, led by a five-*chi* boy carrying a switch and following behind—Wang Chongmin notes: *Leiju* 94 writes the first \"而\" as \"为,\" which is likely correct. The ancient character for *wei* (为) was written as □, easily confused with *er* (而). This book’s *Yellow Emperor* chapter reads: \"Those who attain this and exhaust it—how could they be upright?\" *Zhuangzi*’s *Dasheng* chapter reads: \"How could things restrain them?\" The *Jifu* edition of *Liezi* reads: \"How could they be corrected?\"—this is evidence. Wang Shumin notes: *Taiping Yulan* 833, *Shiwen Leiju* (later collection) 39, and *Tianzhong Ji* 54 all write \"而群\" as \"为群.\" Wang’s point is valid. If they wish to go east, they go east; if west, they go west. But if Yao were to lead a single sheep, with Shun carrying the switch and following behind, they could not move forward.\n\nMoreover, I have heard: fish that can swallow a boat do not swim in shallow streams; the great swan soars high and does not alight in filthy ponds. Why? Their aspirations are lofty.\"",

Why? Their tones are sparse.\n\nThe character *zhong* (钟) appears as *zhong* (锺) in Wang’s edition and is identical in the *Jifu* edition; here, it follows the standard versions. Tao Hongqing notes: \"奏\" should be \"凑.\" *Cou* means convergence. Those who govern the great do not govern the petty; those who achieve great deeds do not fuss over trifles—this is what it means.\n\nYang Zhu said: \"The affairs of the distant past have vanished—who records them? The deeds of the Three Sovereigns exist as if they exist not, the affairs of the Five Emperors seem like waking dreams (as the *Shiwen* notes: *jue* is read as *jiao*).

(As the *Shiwen* notes: *shi* is read as in the standard pronunciation, or as *zhi* below, and similarly hereafter.) The events of one’s own lifetime are sometimes heard, sometimes seen—of ten thousand, one is not known. The matters before one’s eyes now exist, now cease—of a thousand, one is not known. From the distant past to the present, the years are indeed beyond counting. Yet since Fuxi’s time, over three hundred thousand years have passed, and all—wisdom and folly, beauty and ugliness, success and failure, right and wrong—have dissolved into nothingness, differing only in the swiftness or slowness of their passing.\n\n[Annotation:] To be bewildered by such swiftness or slowness, to race endlessly in pursuit—is this not contemptible? To pride oneself on fleeting praise or blame, to wear body and spirit raw for it, and to seek a lingering name for a few hundred years after death (as the *Shiwen* notes: *yao* is read as in *yī yáo qiè*)—can this moisten dry bones?

      "translated_text": "Yang Zhu said: \"Humans resemble the classes of Heaven and Earth, bearing the nature of the Five Constants. [Annotation:] *Xiao* means 'to resemble.' Alike in yin and yang, their nature follows the Five Phases. The *Shiwen* notes: *Xiao* is written as *qiao*, pronounced like *xiao*; some versions use *xiao*. Ren Dachun said: In the *Huainanzi*, 'to immerse in thoughts of *xiao* types,' Gao You annotates: '*Xiao* means things that resemble.' The *Hanshu: Xingfa Zhi* states: 'All people resemble the forms of Heaven and Earth.' Yan Shigu takes *xiao* as *xiao*, thus *xiao*, *qiao*, and *xiao* are interchangeable.\"\n\nOf all living beings, humans are the most spiritually endowed. Yet their claws and teeth are insufficient for defense, their skin and flesh inadequate for self-protection. The *Shiwen* notes: *Han* is written as *han*, pronounced like *han*. *Yu* is pronounced *yǔ*. Their swift movement is not enough to pursue benefit or flee harm—originally 'flee benefit and harm,' now corrected according to the Dunhuang manuscript S.7776. Bo Jun notes: The *Shuowen* states: '□ means to hasten.' The *Shiming* says: 'Slow walking is called *bu*, swift walking *qu*, and hasty movement *zou*.' The *Lüshi Chunqiu: Quanxun* reads: 'The King of Qi fled to Ju,' with the annotation: '*Zou* means to flee.' The *Shiwen* writes *qu* as *qu*, pronounced *qū*.\n\nDevoid of fur or feathers to shield against cold and heat, humans must rely on external things for sustenance. All versions include 'nature' after 'sustenance,' now deleted following the Dunhuang manuscript S.7776. They employ wisdom rather than brute force. Thus, what wisdom values is preserving the self; what force disdains is encroaching upon others. Yet the body does not belong to oneself—once born, one cannot but preserve it. Things do not belong to oneself—once possessed, one cannot discard them. 'Cannot discard them'—the Northern Song, Wang, Qin block-printed Lu, and Shidetang editions all read 'cannot but discard them.' Yu Yue said: It should read 'cannot discard them,' as the following text states: 'Though one does not discard things, one cannot claim ownership of them.' The version 'cannot but discard' contradicts the subsequent passage, likely influenced by the earlier 'once born, one cannot but preserve it,' mistakenly changing *er* to *bu*. Bo Jun notes: Yu Yue's argument is sound; the Daoist Canon's unannotated text, Lin Xiyi's edition, and the Jifu edition correctly use *er*. Here, the text is amended accordingly. The *Shiwen* writes 'er qu' as 'bu qu,' with *qu* pronounced *qù*.\n\nThe body is indeed the master of life, just as things are the master of sustenance. Though one preserves life, all versions include 'body' after 'life,' now deleted following the Dunhuang manuscript S.7776—one cannot claim ownership of the body. Though one does not discard things, one cannot claim ownership of them. To claim ownership of things or the body is to wrongfully appropriate the bodies and things of the world. The *Shiwen* notes: *Heng* is pronounced with the falling tone, as below. Those who neither wrongfully appropriate the bodies nor the things of the world—all versions omit these fourteen characters, now restored from the Dunhuang manuscript—are none other than the sages! [Annotation:] Only the sage understands that the body cannot be privately owned, nor things possessed.\n\nTao Hongqing said: Zhang's annotation misplaces the punctuation. 'Are none other than the sages' should be read with the following, forming an inverted sentence: 'Are none other than the sages—those who share the bodies of the world, share the things of the world—are none other than the perfected!' This both praises their sagacity and acknowledges their perfection. The *Yi Jing: Qian Gua Wenyan* states: 'Are none other than the sages! Those who know advance and retreat, life and death, yet do not lose their correctness—are none other than the sages!' The syntax is identical. Bo Jun notes: Tao's edition omits the fourteen characters 'neither wrongfully appropriate,' hence his argument. With these characters restored, Tao's interpretation is no longer tenable. The *Shiwen* connects the following passage as a single segment: 'Those who share the bodies of the world, share the things of the world—are none other than the perfected!' This is called the utmost of the utmost. [Annotation:] To regard the bodies of the world as one's own body, the things of the world as one's own things—who but the perfected can achieve this? Having realized the error of selfishness and the rightness of impartiality, this is called the utmost of the utmost.\n\nYang Zhu said: \"The people cannot rest because of four concerns: The *Shiwen* notes: *Wei* is pronounced *wéi*, as below. First, for longevity, [Annotation:] They dare not indulge their desires. Second, for reputation, [Annotation:] They dare not act recklessly.

Rising at dawn and retiring at dusk, he takes this as the constant of his nature; sipping bean broth and chewing coarse greens—[Annotation:] The *Jizuan Yuanhai*, chapter 57, cites *shuǐ* (\"water\") for *shū* (\"bean\").

His flesh is coarse and thick, [Annotation:] *Cū* is pronounced *cāng*, his sinews and joints taut and tense—[Annotation:] *□* is pronounced *qūwèi*. [Annotation:] The *Shiwen* writes *□* as *kuì*, noting: *Jīn* is pronounced *jīn*. It is read *kuì*, meaning \"sinews and joints tense.\" Alternatively written as *□□*, the first character is pronounced *quán*, the second *qūwèi*. *□chǒu* describes the appearance of tense sinews. Qin Enfu notes: The *Shiwen*’s \"read *kuì*\" refers to the pronunciation of *□*. *□* should be written as *□*. *□* belongs to the *guǐ* phonetic series, hence it is read *qūwèi*. If it were *□*, it would be read *zhīchūn*. The *Yupian* states: \"*□□*, an ugly appearance.\" *□* is written with the *yuè* radical and the *guàn* phonetic; *□* with the *yuè* radical and the *juǎn* phonetic. *Guàn* and *juǎn* are phonetic transformations. The *Huainanzi*’s *Xiumu Xun* writes it as *□*, with Gao You’s commentary: \"Read as *quánhéng*’s *quán*, pronounced with a tense tone. *□* is read *kuí*.\" That *kuí* is a reversal of *qūwèi* is clear proof. The *Erya*’s \"*qǔn* is its sprout\" is glossed by Guo as *qiǎnquǎn*, which is clear evidence that *kuì* is a corrupted character. [Annotation:] Zhang Zhan’s edition writes *□* as *□*; the *Huainanzi* writes it as *□*. Neither the \"mountain\" nor the \"mouth\" radical is correct—it should be the \"moon\" radical. Ren Dachun states: *□* has no *qūwèi* pronunciation and should be an error for *kuì*. Furthermore, the Shide Tang edition adds after \"sinews tense in appearance\" the six characters \"*yuē kuì yīn qūwèi qiè*,\" which the Daoist Canon edition omits in error. This is because alternate versions of the *Liezi* may write *□kuì*, and the *Shiwen* thus explains the two characters separately. Where it says \"*□* ugly,\" it glosses the meaning of *□*. The *Yupian*, *Guangya*, and *Guangyun* all state \"*□□* ugly in appearance,\" hence *□* ugly is used to explain the meaning of *□*. Where it says \"sinews tense in appearance is called *kuì*, pronounced *qūwèi*,\" it clarifies the difference in pronunciation and meaning between *kuì* and *□*. The Daoist Canon edition’s omission of the six characters from \"*yuē kuì*\" onward makes it seem as if *□* ugly is glossed as \"sinews tense in appearance,\" but *□* ugly has no such definition. [Annotation:] Bo Jun notes: Ren’s argument is incorrect. The five characters \"*kuì yīn qūwèi qiè*\" originally belong to Zhang’s commentary; the Shide Tang edition conflates them with the *Shiwen*, and Ren’s supplementation of the *Shiwen* based on the Shide Tang edition is unreliable. Furthermore, the *Yupian* and *Guangyun*’s \"*□□* ugly in appearance\" (the *Guangya*’s *Shigu* writes \"*□□* ugly\") should be read as *□□* together. Wang’s *Guangya Shuzheng* cites the *Huainanzi*’s *Xiumu Xun*: \"*kuīduō huī*,\" which is the *Guangya*’s \"*□huī□*,\" the same as this *□□*. Ren’s reading of *□* ugly is incorrect. However, the *Shiwen* also contains errors and omissions.\n\nIf one morning he is placed amidst soft furs and fine silk curtains—[Annotation:] *Tímò* is pronounced *tímò*—and offered fine grains, meats, orchids, and citrus, his heart will be vexed and his body restless, and internal heat will breed illness.

      "translated_text": "\"Clinging to fame and thereby burdening reality will lead to concerns over peril and ruin that cannot be saved—how could it be merely a matter between ease and joy or sorrow and suffering?\"\n\nQin Enfu notes: From the passage beginning *\"Wei, the Viscount Duanmu Shu,\"* onward, Lu’s commentary is missing, and there is no way to supplement or correct it.\n\n*Liezi Jishi*, Volume Eight: *Shuofu* (Explaining Symbols)\n\n[Annotation:] Affairs are boundless, with fortune and misfortune mutually propelling one another. When words are spoken and verified, they are grasped within the convergence of change and adaptation.\n\n[Exegesis:] This chapter, departing from the *Mo Ming* edition, approximates form to discern spirit. Establishing affairs reveals the real; pursuing names seeks reality. Only then does one recognize the loss of the Dao in following emotions and the forfeiture of truth in indulging desires. Thus, those who know the Dao do not lose their timely self, and those who employ ability need not distance themselves from harm.\n\nQin Enfu notes: The character *\"zi\"* (自) in the exegesis is likely superfluous.\n\nMaster Liezi studied under Master Huqiu Zilin.\nMaster Huqiu Zilin said: \"If you understand *holding back*, then we may speak of *holding the self*.\"\n[Annotation:] Laozi said, *\"Hold back the self, and the self will advance.\"*\nLiezi said: \"I have heard of *holding back*.\"\nMaster Huqiu replied: \"Look at your shadow, and you will understand.\"\nLiezi turned and observed his shadow: when the body was bent, the shadow was crooked; when the body was straight, the shadow was upright. Thus, crookedness and straightness follow the body and do not reside in the shadow; bending and extending depend on the object and not on the self. This is called *holding back to occupy the forefront*.\"\n[Annotation:] No thing can contend with it, so it always occupies the forefront. These words, though Huzi’s answer, are not clearly expounded. Liezi grasped the meaning of *holding back* and thereby explained it himself, so Huzi did not further respond.\n[Exegesis:] The shadow arises from the form, and crookedness or straightness originates in the form’s movement. The form exists through the spirit, and authenticity or falsity lies in the spirit’s function. If one discerns the form by observing the shadow and knows the spirit by understanding the form—without demanding the shadow to rectify the body or clinging to the body to illuminate the Dao—then by observing the branch, one knows the root, and by examining the manifest, one perceives the subtle. Only then can one always occupy the forefront.\n\nThe *Daozang* edition and Yuan edition both read *\"seems Huzi’s answer\"* instead of *\"with Huzi’s answer.\"*\nBo Jun notes: The *Huainanzi*’s *Miu Cheng Xun* states: *\"Liezi studied under Huzi and, observing the reflection in a pillar, understood *holding back*.\"*\n\n[Phonetic Annotations:] *Zheng* (争) is pronounced *zhèng*. *Xie* (解) is pronounced *xiè*. *Fu* (复) is read *fú*.\n\nGuan Yin said to Master Liezi: \"Beautiful words produce a beautiful echo; foul words produce a foul echo. A long body casts a long shadow; a short body casts a short shadow. The name is the echo; the self is the shadow.\"\n[Annotation:] The retribution of good and evil is like echoes and shadows—there is no discrepancy in principle.\nTao Hongqing notes: The preceding line, *\"The name is the echo,\"* follows from *\"Beautiful words produce a beautiful echo; foul words produce a foul echo\"*—an echo arises from words, but words are not the echo. This line follows from *\"A long body casts a long shadow; a short body casts a short shadow\"*—a shadow arises from the body, but the body is not the shadow. Now, saying *\"the self is the shadow\"* is somewhat difficult to reconcile. Here, *\"self\"* refers to the body that receives retribution, entirely distinct in meaning from *\"long body\"* or *\"short body\"* above. The subsequent text—*\"Measure lies in the self; verification lies in others. If others love me, I must love them; if others hate me, I must hate them\"*—means that by observing others’ love or hatred toward me, one knows my own love or hatred toward others. Loving or hating others is the self; others loving or hating that self is the shadow. Thus, *\"the self is the shadow.\"*\nWang Shumin notes: *\"Self\"* (身) should be *\"conduct\"* (行). The following line, *\"Be cautious in your conduct, for it will be followed,\"* directly continues this idea. The current text’s *\"self\"* is an error, arising from the preceding *\"long body\"* and *\"short body.\"* The *Shizi*, as cited in the *Taiping Yulan* (430), reads *\"conduct is the shadow,\"* providing collateral evidence.\nBo Jun notes: Wang’s proposal is tenable; Tao’s interpretation, though ingenious, is overly circuitous.\n\nThus it is said: Be cautious in your words, for they will be harmonized; be cautious in your conduct, for it will be followed.\n[Annotation:] As the saying goes: *\"Speak good words, and a thousand *li* away they will respond; act nearby, and it will be seen afar.\"*\nJiang Yougao notes: *\"He\"* (和) and *\"sui\"* (随) rhyme, both belonging to the ancient *ge* rhyme group.\n[Phonetic Annotations:] *Jian* (见) is pronounced *xiàn*.\n\nTherefore, the sage observes the outgoing to know the incoming, examines the past to know the future—this is the principle by which they possess foreknowledge.\n[Annotation:] Seeing words go out and echoes return, forms depart and shadows arrive, one understands that the principle of retribution is no different. Yet things have not yet awakened to this, so it is called *\"foreknowledge.\"*\n[Exegesis:] The echo follows the sound; if the sound is good, the echo is beautiful. The name follows reality; if reality is good, the name is true. Thus, the name is the echo of the sound, and the self is the shadow of the spirit. Sounds emit and echoes harmonize; conduct is practiced and the spirit follows. Therefore, the sage hears the echo to know the sound and sees conduct to know the Dao.\n\nThe measure lies in the self; verification lies in others. If others love me, I must love them; if others hate me, I must hate them.\n[Annotation:] Ritual measure lies in the self; verification lies with others. Love and hatred follow accordingly—things do not betray the self.\nTang and Wu loved the world, thus they reigned.",

(The character *jìng* [径] appears in one version as *qú* [衢], and in another as *shù* [术]. *Fù* [复] is pronounced *fú* [扶又切].) To seek profit by such means—is it not difficult?\n[Annotation:] There has never been profit gained by violating principle.\n\n[Exegesis:] If the matters of verification and measure are clear yet the Dao is not followed, it is like walking without using the gate or the thoroughfare. To seek profit for oneself in the world by such means—is it not difficult? (Qin Enfu notes: According to the exegesis, the Lu edition reads *qú* [衢] instead of *jìng* [径].)\n\nI have observed the virtue of Shennong and Yan, examined the books of Yu, Xia, Shang, and Zhou, and measured them against the words of learned scholars and worthies. There has never been a case of survival or ruin, rise or fall that did not proceed from this Dao.\n[Annotation:] From ancient times to the present, there has been no instance without verification.\n\n[Exegesis:] By examining their conduct and verifying their traces, the words of ancient sage-kings and worthies remain consistent with those of others. Survival and ruin, rise and fall are all clearly evident. There has never been a case of governance not proceeding from this Dao.\n\nYan Hui said: \"Those who ask about the Dao do so to become wealthy.\n[Annotation:] *Ask* here means *to learn.* (*Wèi* [为] is pronounced *wéi* [于伪切].) Now that I have obtained a pearl, I am wealthy—what need is there for the Dao?\"\n[Annotation:] The Dao is the root of wealth; the pearl is its branch. When the root exists, the branch remains; to preserve the branch is to lose the root. (The Northern Song edition omits the character *yě* [也] after *\"wealth’s branch,\"* and Wang’s edition follows this. Here, it is restored according to the *Four Exegeses* edition.)\n\nMaster Liezi said: \"Jie and Zhou valued profit and slighted the Dao, thus they perished.\n[Annotation:] They were not without wealth, but by losing the root, they lost themselves. How fortunate that I have not yet spoken to you of this! A person without righteousness eats and nothing more—\n[Annotation:] *Righteousness* means *what is fitting.* One who attains the fitting principle of reason cannot be deprived by external things. Such a person is no better than a chicken or a dog. Forcibly seizing food and butting heads—\n(Yu Yue says: *Mǐ* [靡] should be read as *mó* [摩]. In the *Mati* chapter of the *Zhuangzi*, it says, *\"When pleased, they rub necks together.\"* The exegesis by Li cites *mó* [摩], showing that *mǐ* [靡] and *mó* [摩] share the same meaning. Thus, *mǐ jiǎo* [靡角] means *rubbing horns together.* Wang Shumin says: Yu’s interpretation is correct. The *Taiping Yulan* [421] quotes it as *mó* [磨]. *Mó* [磨], *mó* [摩], and *mǐ* [靡] were interchangeable in ancient usage. *Mǐ* [靡] is pronounced *wén bǐ* [文彼切]. The *Han Shi Waizhuan* says: *Mǐ* [靡] means *together.* The *Lüshi Chunqiu* says: *Jiǎo* [角] means *to test strength.* This passage describes those who value profit and slight the Dao, eating and nothing more—like birds and beasts that eat their fill and then butt heads together to compete for dominance.) The victor gains control—such are birds and beasts.\n[Annotation:] To seek victory by force is not the human Dao. (Wang Chongmin says: The character *zhì* [制] is semantically incoherent here and should be *lì* [利], a scribal error. The *Taiping Yulan* [421] quotes it as *\"the victor gains profit,\"* which confirms this.) To be no better than chickens, dogs, birds, or beasts yet desire others’ respect—this cannot be attained.\n[Annotation:] How could one desire others’ respect? When the Dao is present, one is naturally respected. If others do not respect you, danger and disgrace will befall you.\n[Annotation:] To be willingly esteemed without resentment is what it means to be respected. If one violates this principle, ruin will follow.\n\n[Exegesis:] *Wealth* means *without lack*—it does not refer to the wealth of profit-seeking. To value profit and slight the Dao is how Jie and Zhou perished. Chickens, dogs, birds, and beasts know nothing of benevolence and righteousness; they fight over food and rely on strength, unaware of anything else. To act thus is to invite danger and disgrace upon oneself. How could one then expect others’ respect? This is what is meant by *seeking reality through names.*\n\nLiezi had hit the target in archery.\n[Annotation:] He had hit it by chance, not through deliberate aim. (*Zhòng* [中] is pronounced *dīng zhòng* [丁仲切] below.)\nHe asked Master Guan Yin about it. Master Yin said:\n(Wang Chongmin says: The *Taiping Yulan* [745] includes an additional *guān* [关] here, which is correct. Ancient texts sometimes refer to him as *Guan Yin* but never as *Yinzi* below. Wang Shumin says: Wang’s interpretation is correct. The *Lüshi Chunqiu*’s *Shen Ji* chapter also reads *\"Master Guan Yin said\"* below.)\n\"Do you know why you hit the target?\"\nHe replied: \"I do not.\"\nMaster Guan Yin said: \"Not yet.\"\n[Annotation:] Though he had hit the target, he did not know how, so it was said to be \"not yet.\"\nHe withdrew and practiced. After three years, he returned to report to Master Guan Yin. The Master said: \"Do you know why you hit the target?\"\nLiezi said: \"I know now.\"\nMaster Guan Yin said: \"It is acceptable. Hold to this and do not lose it.\n[Annotation:] With a calm mind and upright body, seeking within oneself, one attains the Dao of hitting the target. Then, one may aim at the target in advance, and every shot will strike without fail. This is not only true of archery—governing a state and cultivating the self are the same.\"",

      "translated_text": "Thus, the sage does not examine whether something endures or perishes but examines the reason it is so.\n\nThough one may hit the target without knowing how, this is not the Dao of hitting the target; though one may endure without knowing why, this is not the principle of endurance. Therefore, in archery, the unskilled and the skilled may both hit the mark, yet those who know *why* they hit it differ. The worthy and the foolish may both endure, yet those who know *why* they endure are distinct.\n\nOne who does not know *why* they hit the target is not the most excellent of the excellent. To grasp it with the hand and respond with the heart, to command the shot and strike the mark—this is attainment. To attain and hold to it is called the Dao. One who knows this Dao may apply it not only to archery but also to governing a state and cultivating the self.\n\nThe master of archery does not value merely hitting the target but values the reason it *must* be hit. Likewise, the master of ordering a state or cultivating the self does not value mere endurance but values the reason it *must* endure. Thus, whether the worthy or the foolish, order or chaos, may be known—this is the presence of the Dao.\n\nLiezi said: \"Those whose appearance is flourishing are arrogant; those whose strength is flourishing are aggressive—they cannot yet be spoken to of the Dao. Only when their hair is streaked with white may one speak to them of it, lest they lose it. How much less can they practice it?\n\nThose who are arrogant and aggressive allow no one to instruct them. With no one to instruct them, they become isolated and lack support. The worthy, however, employ others, and so even in old age they do not decline; even when their wisdom is exhausted, they do not fall into chaos.\n\nThus, the difficulty in governing a state lies not in being worthy oneself but in recognizing worth in others. One who deems themselves worthy is, as stated above, isolated and without support. But one who recognizes worth allows the wise to counsel them and the capable to serve them. With no talent wasted, the state is easily ordered.\"\n\nThe common people rely on appearance and strength. Those who rely on appearance foster arrogance and indolence; those who rely on strength harbor aggressive and combative intentions—they cannot be spoken to of the Dao. Only when their appearance and strength have faded, when their hair is streaked with white, may one speak to them of it. Yet even then, though they may hear the Dao in old age, they cannot attain it—how much less can they practice it? Thus, those who abide in humility and weakness are embraced by the Dao, while those who are self-assertive and aggressive find no one willing to instruct them. With no one willing to instruct them, how can they have support?\n\nThe worthy entrust themselves to others, and so their spirit does not wane with age, nor does their mind fall into chaos when their wisdom is spent. One who governs a state in this way, recognizing worth and employing it, allows worthy talent to serve them. But one who deems themselves worthy and lacks support loses others.\n\nThere was once a man of Song who, for his lord, crafted mulberry leaves from jade.",

      "translated_text": "Wang Chongmin notes: In the *Leiju* (ch. 88) and *Taiping Yulan* (ch. 305 and 457), the character \"寤\" is uniformly written as \"悟.\" The *Shiwen* glosses: \"寤 is pronounced as 悟.\" The army was withdrawn, yet before it returned, raiders had already struck its northern border.\n\n**[Annotation]** What I have done, others may also do. To indulge one’s own ambitions while assuming others will not harbor the same intentions is to be deluded by the distinction between self and other.\n\n**[Exegesis]** To covet gain without understanding that gain must be guarded is the common folly of the vulgar. Thus, desires know no bounds, and the true Dao daily wanes. The value of one who knows the Dao lies in inwardly preserving the Dao without loss and outwardly applying it to things without omission. The worldly, however, are not so: outwardly, they lust after other women, enamored of another’s wife; inwardly, they lose the Dao, and their own wife is beckoned by another.\n\nQin Enfu remarks: In the exegesis, the character \"得\" in \"得有所守\" is likely a superfluous interpolation.\n\nThe state of Jin suffered from rampant banditry. There was a man named Xi Yong—Lu Jun notes: \"郄\" should be written as \"郤.\" The *Shuowen* states, \"郤 was the fief of Shu Hu, a grandee of Jin.\" Duan Yucai’s commentary adds: \"Shu Hu’s son was named Xi Rui, who took his fief as his surname.\" The *Qunshu Zhiyao* correctly writes it as \"郤,\" and the same should apply below. Shao Ying’s *Qunjing Zhengzi* observes: \"The vulgar further corrupt it to '郄,' a variant of '郤.' In the *Hanxue Shichao* by Song En et al., the character '师' appears as '□□,' with a component resembling '卩,' leading the vulgar to alter it to '郄.' The * Yupian* notes: '郄 is a vulgar form of 卩.'\" The *Shiwen* glosses: \"郄 is pronounced *qì* (去逆切). 雍 is pronounced *yōng* (邕).\" Xi Yong could discern a bandit’s appearance—\"貌\" originally read \"眼,\" but the present version follows the *Jifu* and *Shidetang* editions, which correct it to \"貌.\" The *Taiping Yulan* (ch. 499) also writes it as \"貌.\" The *Shiwen* notes: \"貌 appears in one edition as 眼.\"—and examine the space between their brows and lashes to uncover their true nature. The *Shiwen* glosses: \"睫 is pronounced *jié* (接).\" The Marquis of Jin sent him to identify bandits, and among thousands, not one escaped his detection.\n\nThe Marquis of Jin rejoiced greatly and told Zhao Wenzi: \"I have found one man, and the bandits of the entire state are as good as eradicated. Lu Jun notes: The *Taiping Yulan* (ch. 499) includes a \"之\" after \"为.\" The *Shiwen* glosses: \"为 is pronounced *wěi* (于伪切). Why should I employ many?\" Wenzi replied: \"My lord relies on surveillance to catch bandits, yet bandits will not be eradicated. Moreover, Xi Yong will surely not meet a natural death.\" Soon after, the bandits plotted among themselves: \"The one who has cornered us is Xi Yong.\" Wang Chongmin notes: The *Taiping Yulan* (ch. 499) includes a \"以\" after \"所,\" which is correct. They then joined forces to murder him.\n\n**[Annotation]** \"残\" means to kill or destroy. Wang Chongmin notes: The *Qunshu Zhiyao* and *Taiping Yulan* (ch. 499) write \"残\" as \"戕,\" and the latter may be closer to the original. The *Shuowen* defines \"戕\" as \"a minister from another state who assassinates a ruler,\" hence Zhang’s annotation reads \"to kill treacherously.\" The *Shiwen* writes \"残\" as \"戕,\" glossing: \"戕 is pronounced *qiāng* (墙), as in the annotation; one edition writes it as 残.\"\n\nThe Marquis of Jin, upon hearing this, was greatly alarmed. The *Shiwen* writes \"骇\" as \"駴,\" noting: \"It is the same as 骇.\" He immediately summoned Wenzi and said: \"As you predicted, Xi Yong is dead! But what method should we use to capture the bandits?\" The *Qinke Lu* edition omits the character \"盗.\" Wenzi replied: \"There is a Zhou proverb that says: 'One who sees the fish in the depths is inauspicious; one who predicts hidden things brings calamity.' Jiang Yougao notes: \"祥 and 殃 form a rhyme, both belonging to the ancient *yang* rhyme group.\" Lu Jun notes: The *Hanfeizi* (*Shuo Lin Shang*) states: \"An ancient proverb says, 'One who knows the fish in the depths is inauspicious.'\" The *Shiwen* glosses: \"料 is pronounced in the falling tone (去声). Moreover, if my lord wishes to eliminate banditry, you must elevate the worthy and employ them. Let instruction be clear above, and transformation flow below; if the people have a sense of shame, what banditry will there be?\"\n\n**[Annotation]** This answers the method to stop banditry.\n\nThereupon, they appointed Sui Hui to oversee governance, and the bandits fled to Qin.\n\n**[Annotation]** To employ keen discernment in judging right and wrong is to invite the flight of the deceitful; to use foresight in exposing hidden evils is to incur the hatred of the wicked. Is the peril of wisdom mere empty talk?\n\n**[Exegesis]** Instruction is the outward form, the path by which the multitude walks. Transformation is the Dao, the principle by which the multitude daily lives and inwardly submits. When the heart submits, shame arises; when the outward form is clear, instruction is achieved. Elevate the worthy and employ the capable, and bandits will flee. Someone asked: Zhuangzi said, \"When the sage is born, great bandits arise.\" Yet here it says that elevating the worthy and employing the capable causes bandits to depart. How can this be? The answer: To seek empty fame while losing substance is to give rise to great bandits; to attain substance while forsaking fame is to cause bandits to depart. Thus, elevating the worthy and employing the capable is the pursuit of fame; employing Sui Hui is the attainment of substance. The principles do not contradict each other—what doubt can there be? The *Qunshu Zhiyao* writes \"先\" as \"少\" in the annotation \"用先识,\" which is closer to the original.

This text’s *Huangdi* chapter reads, \"Are you skillful? Do you possess the Way?\" The *Zhuangzi*’s *Zhi Beiyou* chapter reads, \"Are you skillful? Do you possess the Dao?\" Both follow the same pattern. \"How is it that you were able to enter and emerge?\" The man replied, \"When I first entered, I relied on loyalty and trust. When I emerged, I again followed loyalty and trust. Loyalty and trust placed my body amidst the waves, and I dared not act on private motives—the *Qunshu Zhiyao* writes *措* for *错*. Yu Yue notes: The phrase \"loyalty and trust placed my body amidst the waves\" contains a superfluous \"loyalty and trust,\" likely borrowed from the preceding sentence. Wang Shumin notes: Yu Yue’s observation is correct. The *Qunshu Zhiyao* indeed omits the words \"loyalty and trust.\" \"Thus I was able to enter and emerge—this is how.\"\n\nConfucius said to his disciples, \"Remember this, all of you!\" *Shiwen* notes: *识* is pronounced *zhì*. \"If even water can be approached with loyalty, trust, and sincerity, how much more so can people?\" The annotation notes: This passage appears in the *Huangdi* chapter with minor differences, but its meaning is not distinct, so its meaning is not re-explained here. The explanation states: Loyalty harmonizes with all things; trust leaves no room for doubt. Harmonizing without doubt and refraining from private motives—this is how one enters and emerges. Thus, to harmonize without doubt and refrain from private motives is to grasp the Dao! This passage also appears in the *Huangdi* chapter. Bo Jun notes: This passage centers on the two words \"loyalty\" and \"trust\"; the words \"and sincerity\" may be superfluous. The *Qunshu Zhiyao* omits the words \"and sincerity,\" confirming this. *Shiwen* notes: *复* is pronounced *fù*.\n\nLord Bai asked Confucius, \"Can one speak with you in secret?\" Wang Chongmin notes: The *Lüshi Chunqiu*’s *Jingyu* chapter, the *Huainanzi*’s *Daoying* chapter, and the *Taiping Yulan* (chapter 58) all include the word \"to\" after \"asked\"—the current text is missing it due to a scribal error. Confucius did not respond. The annotation notes: Lord Bai was the grandson of King Ping of Chu and the son of Crown Prince Jian. His father was slandered by Fei Wuji and fled to Zheng, where the Zheng people killed him. Bai wished to have ministers Zixi and Ziqing attack Zheng, but though they agreed, they did not act. When Jin attacked Zheng, Zixi and Ziqing prepared to aid Zheng. Bai grew angry, saying, \"The Zheng people are here—our enemies are not far off!\" He wished to kill Zixi and Ziqing, so he questioned Confucius. Confucius, knowing his intent, did not respond. *微言* means \"secret plans.\" The explanation states: *微言* refers to secret speech, which others cannot know.

Lüshi Chunqiu’s *Jingyu* chapter, in Gao You’s annotation, reads: \"Bai, together with his uncle the Prime Minister Zixi and the Marshal Ziqing, attacked Zheng, agreeing but not acting.\" Here, \"與\" (*together with*) should also be \"欲\" (*wished to*). Zhang’s annotation frequently cites Gao’s, and this note is also an abridgment of Gao’s text.\n\nThe *Shiwen* reads \"報令\" instead of \"欲令,\" and notes: *Fei* is pronounced *fangwei*; *Sheng* (Bai’s given name) is pronounced *shizheng*; *ling* is pronounced *langding*.\n\nLord Bai asked, \"If one casts a stone into water, what then?\" Wang Shumin states: The character \"問\" (*asked*) is superfluous, having been carried over from the earlier passage \"Lord Bai asked Confucius.\" The *Shilei Fu* (Chapter 7), *Taiping Yulan* (Chapter 58), *Jizuan Yuanhai* (Chapter 1), and *Tianzhong Ji* (Chapter 9) all omit the character \"問.\" The *Lüshi Chunqiu*’s *Jingyu* chapter and the *Huainanzi*’s *Daoying* chapter likewise omit it.\n\nConfucius said, \"A skilled diver from Wu could retrieve it.\" The annotation explains: A stone cast into water sinks, just as subtle speech cannot be perceived. Thus, Confucius answered that only a skilled diver could retrieve it, illustrating that nothing can remain hidden.\n\nLu Wenchao states: In the *Zangben* annotation, the character \"人\" (*person*) appears after \"言\" (*speech*), and \"不可覺\" (*cannot be perceived*) is written as \"不能覺\" (*unable to perceive*).\n\nLord Bai asked, \"If one pours water into water, what then?\" Confucius said, \"When the waters of the Zi and the Meng rivers mingle, Yi Ya could distinguish them by taste.\" The annotation explains: Even a master of flavors could tell them apart. The *Jie* states: Casting a stone into water is like traces that cannot be seen; pouring water into water is like blending that cannot be concealed. Flavors, once distinct like the Zi and Meng rivers, cannot be merged—only through profound resonance with principle can one grasp them.\n\nThe *Shiwen* notes: *Zi* is pronounced *ceqi*; *Meng* is pronounced *cheng*; *fu* is pronounced *fuyou*; *bie* is pronounced *bili*.\n\nLord Bai said, \"Is it truly impossible to share subtle speech with others?\" The Northern Song edition, Wang’s edition, and the *Sijie* edition read \"故\" (*therefore*) instead of \"固\" (*truly*). Wang Chongmin states: The *Daozang* unannotated edition, *Jifu* edition, *Huainanzi*’s *Daoying* chapter, and *Taiping Yulan* (Chapter 58) all have \"固\" instead of \"故.\" Bo Jun notes: \"固\" is correct; the text has been emended accordingly.\n\nConfucius said, \"Why would it be impossible? Only one who knows the meaning of speech can do so.\" The annotation explains: *Wei* (*meaning*) refers to the intent behind speech. The intent behind speech is precisely its subtlety. When manifested in action, nothing remains hidden. The *Shiwen* notes: *Qu* is pronounced *qu*.\n\n\"One who knows the meaning of speech does not speak through words.\" The annotation explains: To speak through words is to lack subtlety or concealment. The *Jie* states: Emotions arise and affairs become evident; flavors differ yet can be tasted—only the boundless spirit can grasp them. One who knows the meaning of speech achieves spiritual resonance. Those who fight over fish get wet; those who chase beasts run—not because they delight in it. The annotation explains: It is the natural course of events that they get wet or run. Bo Jun notes: The *Lüshi Chunqiu*’s *Junan* chapter states, \"Those who rescue the drowning get wet; those who pursue fugitives run.\" The *Shiwen* notes: *Le* is pronounced *luo*.\n\n\"Thus, the highest speech transcends words.\" The annotation explains: Principles become clear of themselves; transformation proceeds on its own. The *Shiwen* notes: *Qu* is pronounced *qulv*.\n\n\"The highest action is non-action.\" The annotation explains: Principles fulfill themselves; things follow of their own accord. \"What shallow minds contend over is trivial.\" The annotation explains: Clinging to the superficial while losing the root, they only resolve disputes after matters become evident—rarely do they avoid failure. The *Jie* states: Fish belong in water; those who fight over them get wet. Beasts run in the wild; those who chase them run—not because they delight in it, but because circumstances compel them. Thus, the highest speech does not reside in words, and the highest action requires no doing. Shallow minds pursue trivialities and constantly lose sight of principle. Where the Dao is enacted, all things find their proper place. The *Shiwen* notes: *Zhi* is pronounced *zhi*; *xian* is pronounced *xianqian*.\n\nLord Bai, unable to restrain himself, died in the bathhouse. The annotation explains: Not understanding the meaning of speech, he proceeded to create chaos and thus met with disaster. The *Jie* states: Acting in blind fury without regard for principle, he died to satisfy his impulses—this is how the foolish disrupt order. Yu Yue states: The character \"已\" (*already*) is an error for \"也\" (*indeed*). The *Huainanzi*’s *Daoying* chapter reads \"白公不得也\" (*Lord Bai did not attain it*), and the *Lüshi Chunqiu*’s *Jingyu* chapter reads \"白公弗得也\" (*Lord Bai could not attain it*), both serving as evidence. Zhang’s annotation, \"Not understanding the meaning of speech, he proceeded to create chaos and thus met with disaster,\" precisely explains the meaning of \"不得\" (*did not attain*). The *Shiwen* notes: *Nan* is pronounced *nandan*.\n\nViscount Xiang of Zhao sent Xin Zhi Muzi to attack the Di. The annotation explains: Muzi was Xin Zhi Gou, a household minister of Viscount Xiang. The Di were the Xianyu. Bo Jun notes: This event is also recorded in the *Guoyu* (Chapter 9), the *Lüshi Chunqiu*’s *Shenda* chapter, and the *Huainanzi*’s *Daoying* chapter. The *Shiwen* notes: Muzi was Xin Zhi Gou, a grandee of Jin. *Di* is pronounced *di*.\n\nHe was victorious, and the *Shiwen* treats this as a complete sentence. He captured the people of Zuoren and Zhongren. The annotation explains: Zuoren and Zhongren were two towns of the Xianyu. He sent a courier to announce the victory. The annotation explains: *Ju* means *transmit*; *ye* means *announce*. The *Jie* states: He hurried to announce the triumph. The *Shide Tang* edition omits the character \"來\" (*come*). The *Shiwen* notes: *Ju* is pronounced *ju*; *chuan* is the departing tone.",

Bai grew angry, saying, \"The Zheng people are here—our enemies are not far off!\" He wished to kill Zixi and Ziqing, so he questioned Confucius. Confucius, knowing his intent, did not respond. *微言* means \"secret plans.\" The explanation states: *微言* refers to secret speech, which others cannot know. Lord Bai was the grandson of King Ping of Chu and the son of Crown Prince Jian. When Jian fled to Zheng, Lord Bai sought to cause chaos, so Confucius did not respond.",

      "translated_text": "Viscount Xiang was eating when his countenance turned anxious. His attendants said, \"In a single morning, two cities have fallen—this is cause for joy among men. Yet why does my lord wear such a troubled expression?\"\n\nViscount Xiang replied, \"The greatness of the Yangtze and Yellow River lasts no more than three days,\"—referring to the ebb and flow of their tides. \"A whirlwind or torrential rain does not endure the whole morning. The *Shiwen* notes: *piao* is pronounced *fuxiao*. The sun at its zenith does not tarry for even a moment,\"—for that which waxes to its fullest must wane. Bo Jun notes: The *Lüshi Chunqiu* and *Huainanzi* both omit the phrase \"does not endure the whole morning.\" Liang Lvsheng said: The *Daodejing* states, \"A whirlwind does not last the morning; a sudden rain does not last the day\"—this is the source of Viscount Xiang’s meaning.\n\n\"Now, the virtue and conduct of the Zhao clan have not been cultivated through accumulation. Without accumulated virtue yet achieving such weighty success, one cannot but be wary. Yu Yue said: The character *shi* (*施*) is superfluous, likely a duplication of the character *yu* (*于*). The *Lüshi Chunqiu*’s *Shenda* chapter also contains this passage, and it indeed lacks the character *shi*. Wang Chongmin said: Yu Yue’s observation is correct. The *Huainanzi*’s *Daoying* chapter likewise omits *shi*. The *Shiwen* notes: *xing* is pronounced *xiameng*.\n\n\"In a single morning, two cities have fallen—how can ruin not overtake us?\"—for he who does not forget ruin will not perish. The annotation explains: Unable to accumulate virtue and deeds, yet by sheer force seizing two cities—when things reach their zenith, they must decline. What awaits but ruin? Thus, the wise do not rejoice in greed, for they know the peril of fleeting gain. Only then can one truly cultivate virtue.\n\nConfucius, hearing of this, said, \"The Zhao clan shall flourish! For anxiety is the very means by which they shall prosper\"—such deep caution. \"Joy is the very means by which they shall perish\"—for it leads to arrogance and boasting. Victory is not the difficult part; preserving it is the true challenge. Bo Jun notes: Gao You’s commentary on the *Lüshi Chunqiu* states: *chi* (*持*) means *to preserve*.\n\n\"The worthy ruler preserves victory by this means, and thus his blessings extend to later generations. The states of Qi, Chu, Wu, and Yue all once achieved victory, yet in the end met their ruin. Liang Qichao said: From this passage, it is evident that this text must contain later interpolations. *Liezi* and Zheng Siyang were contemporaries, yet though Wu and Yue had already fallen, Qi and Chu still existed. The record of Chu’s fall, even if not after the twenty-fourth year of Qin Shi Huang, must have occurred after Yue Yi entered Linzi and Bai Qi entered Ying.\n\n\"They failed to grasp how to preserve victory. Only a ruler who embodies the Way can truly preserve it.\"—for all who conquer their rivals are but peer states, and those who cannot preserve victory bring peril and ruin upon themselves.\n\nThe annotation explains: Pride in merit and boasting of ability lead to ruin; anxiety over gain and caution against strength lead to prosperity. The worthy ensure blessings for later generations by this means, and those who follow the Way extend their beneficence to all living beings—this is what it means to preserve victory. To preserve victory is to uphold this caution and vigilance against the arrogance of strength, a path only the man of the Way can tread.\n\nConfucius possessed such strength that he could lift the crossbar of a city gate, yet he refused to be known for his power. The annotation explains: *Jin* means *strength*; *tuo* means *to lift*. Though Confucius could raise the gate’s crossbar, he did not allow his strength to be renowned, for he did not employ it. Sun Yirang said: The *Zuozhuan* (Duke Xiang, Year 10) records: \"The people of Biyang opened the gate, and the officers of the feudal lords entered. The gate’s counterweight was released, but Liao Ren of Ju wrenched it open to let them out.\" It is likely that later traditions conflated the deeds of a Zou grandee with those of Confucius. Hu Huaichen said: Many texts, including the *Lüshi Chunqiu*’s *Shenda* chapter, the *Huainanzi*’s *Daoying* chapter, the *Yanshi Jiaxun*’s *Jiebing* chapter, and the *Shitong*’s *Yashuo* section, all attribute this feat to Confucius. Most collators have not disputed this, though Bi Yuan, in his commentary on the *Lüshi Chunqiu*, once questioned it. Was this because in those times, Confucius the Younger was also commonly called Confucius? Or was it due to repeated transmission errors?\n\nWang Chongmin said: The *Shiwen* notes, \"*Tuo* is also written as *zhao*.\" The *Huainanzi*’s *Zhushu* chapter states: \"Confucius’ intelligence surpassed that of Chang Hong, his courage rivaled Meng Ben’s, his feet could tread the wilds of Jiao and Sou, and his strength could *zhao* the crossbar of a city gate—his abilities were indeed many.\" Gao You’s commentary says: \"*Zhao* means *to lift*.\" The *Lüshi Chunqiu*’s *Shenda* chapter reads: \"Confucius’ strength could lift the crossbar of a city gate.\" Gao You’s commentary says: \"With one hand, he grasped the city gate’s crossbar and lifted it.\" The character *zhuo* (*grasp*) is likely a corruption of *zhao*. Here, *zhao* is used to gloss *ju* (*lift*). Zhang’s commentary states: \"*Tuo* means *to lift*,\" but *tuo* is probably also a corruption of *zhao*. Thus, the *Liezi* originally must have read *zhao*. The *Wen Xuan*’s commentary on the *Wu Du Fu* directly cites it as *zhao*. The *Yilin* quotes it as *ju* (*lift*), which, while capturing the meaning, likely does not preserve the original text of the *Liezi*.\n\nThe *Shiwen* notes: *Jin* is pronounced *jusheng* and means *strength*. *Tuo* is also written as *zhao*. Li Shan’s commentary on the *Wen Xuan*’s *Wu Du Fu* states: \"*Zhao* is the same as *qiao*.\" The *Huainanzi* writes it as *biao*. Xu Shen explains: *Biao* means *to pull*. In ancient times, lifting a city gate’s crossbar from below was difficult.\n\nMozi, though skilled in defense, caused Gongshu Ban to yield, yet he refused to be known for his military knowledge. The annotation explains: Gongshu Ban excelled in crafting siege engines, but Mozi devised defenses that repelled him, earning Ban’s admiration. Yet Mozi did not claim expertise in warfare, for he did not flaunt his ability. The *Shiwen* notes: *Ban* is pronounced *ban*.\n\nThus, the one who truly preserves victory turns strength into weakness—for humility is the mother of triumph.",

      "translated_text": "Wang Chongmin notes: The *Taiping Yulan* (740) includes the character \"blind\" (盲) before \"ailments\" (疾).\n\nThere was a *lanzi* in Song—\n**[Annotation]** Generally, any person or thing whose origin is unknown is called *lan*.\n\n**[Emendation]** The *Shide Tang* edition reads \"者\" instead of \"主\" in the annotation.\n\nRen Dazhuang remarks: In the annotation \"凡人物不知生出者谓之兰也,\" the character \"生\" is likely a corruption of \"妄.\"\n\nYu Yue observes: The *Shuowen Jiezi* (Gate Radical) states: \"□ means to recklessly enter palace chambers, pronounced like *lan* (阑).\" Thus, the *lan* in *lanzi* is an extended sense of □.\n\nSu Shixue says: The meaning of *lanzi* is unclear; the old annotation glosses *lan* as \"reckless,\" but this is also obscure. In modern vernacular, worthless rogues are called *lan zai* (烂仔), and its meaning may derive from this.\n\nThe *Shiwen* states: The *Shiji* commentary says: \"To enter or exit without a tally is *lan* (阑).\" Ying Shao says: \"*Lan* means reckless.\" This so-called *lanzi* refers to those who wander recklessly by means of their skills. It is suspected that *lan* is interchangeable with *lan* (阑).\n\nRen Dazhuang says: *Lan* (兰) and *lan* (阑) were often used interchangeably in ancient texts. The *Hanshu* (*Biography of Xifu Gong*) states: \"Tears flow like *huanlan* (萑兰).\"臣瓒 comments: \"*Huanlan* means tears streaming down.\" Thus, *lan* is the same as *lan* (阑). The *Biography of Wang Mang* states: \"[They] share the same *lan* (兰) as cattle and horses.\" Yan Shigu explains: \"*Lan* refers to barriers, like the *lan* enclosures for cattle and horses.\" The * Yupian* and *Guangyun* define *lan* (阑) as \"to block\" or \"to confine,\" which aligns with Yan Shigu’s note on \"barrier enclosures.\" The *Hou Hanshu* (*Biography of Gongsun Shu*) states: \"[He] also built ten-tiered red towers and *bolan* (帛兰) boats.\" The commentary explains: \"[They were] adorned with silk on their railings (*lan* 槛).\" Thus, *lan* (阑) is the same as *lan* (兰). The *Guanzi* (*Zhong Kuang*) states: \"*Lan* shields and leather armor.\" The commentary says: \"*Lan* refers to what is called *lanqi* (兰锜), a weapon rack.\" The *Shui Jing Zhu* states: \"The county has the *binglan* (兵阑) of the King of Shu.\" The *Huayang Guozhi* states: \"Shu has *binglan* (兵阑).\" *Lan* shields and *lanqi* are thus *binglan*. Generally, *lan* (阑) is often borrowed as *lan* (兰).\n\nIn this passage of the *Liezi*, *lan* (阑) is written as *lan* (兰). Though the meanings in various texts differ, the interchangeable usage is the same.\n\nHe used his skills to seek favor with the Lord of Song Yuan.\n\nWang Chongmin notes: The *Yiwen Leiju* (60), *Taiping Yulan* (344 and 483) all include the character \"Lord\" (君) after \"Song Yuan.\"\n\nWang Shumin says: The *Beitang Shuchao* (122), *Yiwen Leiju* (33 and 61), and *Taiping Yulan* (569) also include \"Lord\" (君). The *Shilei Fu* (13) cites the *Liezi* biography in the same way.\n\nBo Jun notes: \"Song Yuan\" should follow the *Beitang Shuchao*, *Taiping Yulan*, and *Yiwen Leiju* in adding \"Lord\" (君). The Lord of Song Yuan may be the same as the King of Song Yuan mentioned in the *Shiji* (*Biographies of Divination and Strategies*), supplemented by Chu Shaosun. Sima Zhen’s *Suoyin* refers to the King of Song Yuan as the Lord of Song Yuan, which serves as a precedent. Song Zhi Yan was the first to declare himself king, but he was soon destroyed by Qi, leaving no posthumous title. His private posthumous title was King Kang (*Zhan Guo Ce* and *Lüshi Chunlan* *Yinci*), or King Xian (*Xunzi*). Could this be the Lord Yuan?\n\nQian Mu’s *Xian Qin Zhuzixi Nian Kaobian* (*Examination of the King of Song Yuan*) suggests that the King of Song Yuan was the crown prince of King Yan, but this is mere conjecture.\n\nThe *Lüshi Chunqiu* (*Jun Shou*) states: \"A rustic from Lu sent a *bi* (闭) to the King of Song Yuan,\" who should be the same as this Lord Yuan. There was also a Lord Yuan of Song, son of Lord Ping, but he is not this Lord Yuan.\n\nThe *Shiwen* states: \"技\" is written as \"妓,\" pronounced *qiyi*.\n\nThe Lord of Song Yuan summoned him and had him perform.\n\nBo Jun notes: The character \"Lord\" (君) is likely missing after \"Yuan.\" The following text consistently uses \"Lord Yuan,\" which serves as evidence.\n\nThe *Shiwen* states: \"见\" is pronounced *xiàn*.\n\nHis skill involved using a pair of staffs, twice the length of his body, attached to his shins.\n\nBo Jun notes: \"枝\" in the *Shide Tang* edition is written as \"技\"; the *Taiping Yulan* (344 and 483) writes it as \"杖,\" and (569) as \"枝.\"\n\nThe *Shiwen* states: \"倍\" follows the standard pronunciation. \"属\" is pronounced *zhú*. \"\" is pronounced *jìng*.\n\nHe ran and galloped in tandem, juggling seven swords by tossing them in succession, with five swords always in the air. The Lord of Song Yuan was greatly astonished and immediately bestowed gold and silk upon him.\n\nThere was another *lanzi* skilled in *yanxi*—\n**[Annotation]** Like today’s acrobats who perform daring feats in narrow spaces.\n\nWang Chongmin notes: The second \"又\" is likely a superfluous character; the *Taiping Yulan* (483) omits it.\n\nWang Shumin says: The *Yiwen Leiju* (33) and *Taiping Yulan* (569) also omit the second \"又.\"\n\nUpon hearing of this, he also sought favor with the Lord of Song Yuan.\n\nThe *Shiwen* states: \"复\" is pronounced *fù*, the same below.\n\nThe Lord of Song Yuan grew furious and said: \"In the past, there was one with extraordinary skills who sought my favor—\n**[Annotation]** Referring to the earlier performer.\n\nLu Wenchang notes: Guo Pu’s commentary on the *Shan Hai Jing* (*Land of Long-Legged People*) states: \"Today’s acrobats who perform as *qiaoren* (乔人) likely imitate this.\" *Qiao* (侨) and *qiao* (乔) are interchangeable.\n\nThe *Shiwen* states: \"侨\" is pronounced *qiáo*, meaning \"to lodge.\"\n\n—whose skills were of no use. **[Annotation]** End of sentence. It just so happened that I was in high spirits, so I bestowed gold and silk upon him. He must have heard of this and come again, hoping for my reward.\"\n\nHe was detained and nearly executed. The Northern Song edition omits the character \"拟,\" and Wang’s edition follows it; this character is now restored from other editions.\n\nThe *Yiwen Leiju* (61) includes \"将\" before \"拘,\" and the *Taiping Yulan* (569) includes \"乃\" before \"拘.\"\n\nThe *Shiwen* states: One edition omits the character \"拟.\"\n\nAfter a month, he was released.\n\n**[Annotation]** Though the skills were the same, the timing differed, so rewards and merits cannot be demanded in advance.\n\n**[Exegesis]** Those who accumulate benevolence and righteousness to uphold the Dao may preserve their fortune; those who rely on strength and skill for luck will not enjoy lasting prosperity.",

The phrase means 'those born of the son.'\" The *Sang Da Ji* records, \"Ministers, great officers, uncles, brothers, and *zi xing* stand to the east.\" The commentary explains: \"*Zi xing* refers to all descendants.\" *Xing* means \"born.\" The *Guoyu: Chu Yu* states, \"Leading their *zi xing*,\" with Wei Zhao’s commentary: \"*Zi xing* refers to those of the same lineage.\"\n\nBo Le replied, \"A fine horse can be discerned by its form, appearance, sinews, and bones.\n**[Annotation]** A superior horse can be identified by its physical structure.\n**[Annotation]** Wang Chongmin notes: The *Yiwen Leiju* (93) includes the character \"以\" after \"可,\" which is correct.

I have one with whom I share the task of carrying ropes and gathering firewood and greens.\n**[Annotation]** This refers to one who carries ropes and collects firewood and greens, likely a menial laborer. All editions write \"缠,\" but Wang Niansun argues: The character \"缠\" is glossed in various texts as \"winding\" (*Shuowen*) or \"binding\" (*Guangya*), but never as \"rope.\" It should be \"纆,\" a character for \"rope\" in the *Shuowen* (written as □), sometimes appearing as \"纆.\" The *Yijing*, *Kan* hexagram, line six, states: \"系用徽纆.\" Ma Rong explains: \"徽纆 means rope.\" Liu Biao adds: \"Three strands make a *hui*; two strands make a *mo*.\" Most people are familiar with \"缠\" but not \"纆,\" leading to frequent transcription errors. Only the *Daozang* edition of the *Liezi Shiwen* writes \"纆,\" pronounced *mò* (墨), confirming the error in current editions.\n**[Annotation]** Zhu Huan notes: The *Gongyang Zhuan* (Year 14 of Duke Ai) states, \"Then who hunts? The gatherers of firewood.\" The *Mao Commentary* on the *Odes* (*Daya*) explains: \"*Chu rao* refers to gatherers of firewood.\" \"*Chu rao*\" is synonymous with \"*cai xin*\" (gathering firewood); \"*cai*\" may also be written as \"*cài*.\"\n**[Annotation]** Yu Yue argues: \"共\" is a miswriting of \"供.\" The *Shiwen* includes an alternate reading as \"供,\" which is correct. The phrase likely means this person supplies both carrying ropes and gathering firewood. \"担缠薪菜\" describes two tasks: \"担缠\" refers to carrying goods, while \"薪菜\" refers to gathering fuel for cooking. \"缠\" is a miswriting of \"纆,\" and \"菜\" should be \"采,\" as the characters were interchangeable in ancient times.\n**[Annotation]** *Shiwen* notes: \"共, meaning 'together,' also written as 供.\" \"担, pronounced *dān* (丁甘切).\" \"纆, pronounced *mò* (墨).\"\n\nThere is one named Jiu Fang Gao.\" The *Huainanzi* and *Lüshi Chunqiu: Guan Biao* chapter write this as \"Jiu Fang Yin.\"\n**[Annotation]** Hu Huaichen notes: \"Jiu Fang\" is the surname; \"Gao\" is the given name. The *Zhuangzi* mentions Jiu Fang Yin. The *Tongzhi* claims Jiu Fang Gao and Jiu Fang Yin are the same person. I humbly suggest that \"jiu\" and \"gui\" are phonetically close and interchangeable. The *Records of the Grand Historian: Yin Benji* states: \"With the Three Dukes—Xibo, Jiuhou, and Ehou,\" where Xu Guang’s commentary notes: \"One version writes 'Guihou,'\" providing evidence. Thus, \"Jiu Fang\" may derive from the Shang-era Guifang, taking the region as their surname.

Form is what ordinary people discern. Bo Le sighed in admiration at how he forgot form to grasp the spirit, how his focus had reached such a point—realizing he himself fell short of Gao by an immeasurable margin. Thus, while Duke Mu saw failure, Bo Le saw ability.\n\nWhat Gao perceived was the *heavenly mechanism*—\n**[Annotation]** The *heavenly mechanism* refers to what governs the outward form and bones, enabling movement of hooves and limbs. It is grasped in the mind yet leaves no visible trace.\n\n—capturing its essence while forgetting its coarse aspects.\n**[Annotation]** The *Yiwen Leiju* (93), *Peiwen Yunfu* (3), *Tianzhong Ji* (55), *Jingji Leipian* (98), and *Shiwen Leiju: Houji* (38) all include \"而\" here, as do the *Daozang* unannotated edition, Lin Xiyi’s edition, Jifu edition, and Shidetang edition. The *Shiwen Yuelu* notes: *Cu* (coarse) is pronounced like *lu* (deer).\n\nHe saw what lay within while forgetting what lay without—\n**[Annotation]** The *inner essence* refers to the *heavenly mechanism*; the *outer coarse* refers to sex and coat color.\n\nXu Weiyu notes: *Zai* (在) here means \"to examine.\"\n\n—seeing what should be seen,\n**[Annotation]** What should be seen is only the *heavenly mechanism.*\n\n—and not seeing what should not be seen.\n**[Annotation]** What should not be seen includes coat color and sex.\n\nHe fixed his gaze on what ought to be gazed upon—\n**[Annotation]** The *Zang* edition includes \"其\" before \"所.\"\n\n—and disregarded what should not be regarded.\n**[Annotation]** What should not be regarded is not given deliberate attention.\n\nSuch was Gao’s judgment—one that valued what truly mattered in a horse.\n**[Annotation]** Gao’s method was not merely about judging horses; what he attained through spiritual insight must hold a value beyond mere horse-judging, for his art was sublime.\n\n**[Annotation]** The *Sijie* edition reads \"相马\" (judging horses) instead of \"相者\" (judgment). Wang Chongmin notes: The Northern Song edition, *Daozang* edition, and Jifu edition all read \"者,\" which is likely correct. The error may stem from the repeated use of \"马\" (horse) in the surrounding text. The *Huainanzi: Daoying Xun* reads: \"What he judged held a value beyond mere horses.\"\n\nThe horse arrived and proved to be a steed of the world.\n**[Exegesis]** Form and substance are the manifest aspects of the myriad things; spirit and *qi* are the subtle, formless essence. That which operates through form is itself formless; that which employs the formless gives shape to things. Though used all day, its workings go unnoticed; though set in motion year after year, it is not deemed laborious. To know and nurture it is to master the Dao.\n\nWhat Gao saw in what he saw was the spirit. To align with the spirit is to value what truly matters in a horse—something no one else of his time understood.\n\nKing Zhuang of Chu asked Zhan He:\n**[Annotation]** The *Shiwen Yuelu* notes: *Zhan* is pronounced like *zhan* (占).\n\n\"How should one govern the state?\"\n**[Annotation]** Zhan He was likely a recluse.\n\nZhan He replied: \"I am skilled in governing the self but unskilled in governing the state.\"\n**[Annotation]** The *Zhiyi* reads \"何\" (He) instead of \"臣\" (I). The *Lüshi Chunqiu: Zhiyi* also reads \"何闻为身不闻为国\" (He has heard of governing the self but not of governing the state), as does the *Huainanzi: Daoying Xun*.\n\nKing Zhuang of Chu said:\n**[Annotation]** Wang Shumin notes: The character \"庄\" (Zhuang) is superfluous. Since \"King Zhuang of Chu\" was already mentioned above, it need not be repeated here. The *Zhiyi* omits it, as does the *Huainanzi: Daoying Xun*.\n\n\"I have been entrusted with the ancestral temples and the altars of soil and grain. I wish to learn how to preserve them.\"\n\nZhan He replied: \"I have never heard of a case where one’s self was well-governed yet the state fell into chaos.\n**[Annotation]** These two lines also appear in the *Huainanzi: Quan Yan Xun*. The *Shiwen Yuelu* notes: *Zhi* (治, govern) is pronounced like *zhi* (直吏切); the same applies to *guo zhi* (国治, state governance).\n\nNor have I ever heard of a case where one’s self was in disorder yet the state was well-governed. Thus, the root lies in the self; I dare not respond with mere branches.\"\n\nThe king said: \"Well said.\"\n\n**[Exegesis]** To diminish things for the sake of enriching life is the common inclination of petty men; to diminish life for the sake of benefiting things is the deceptive conduct of those who crave fame. To secure the altars of the state, one must place the self after. He who governs the self well finds the state governs itself. The ruler is the master of the state; the spirit is the master of the body. Governing the state lies in pacifying the ruler; governing the self lies in pacifying the spirit. When the spirit is at peace, the Dao is exalted; when the Dao is exalted, the state is well-governed. The spirit is the root of the self; the Dao is the function of the spirit. Thus, he dared not respond with mere branches.\n\nThe Elder of Huqiu said to Sunshu Ao:\n**[Annotation]** A minister of Chu. Yang Bojun notes: The *Shuo Yuan: Jing Shen* records this event differently. The *Shiwen Yuelu* notes: *Ao* (敖) is pronounced like *lao* (五劳切). Sunshu Ao was a minister of Chu.\n\n\"Do you know the three things that incur resentment?\"\n**[Annotation]** Huqiu was a town name. *Zhangren* (丈人) refers to an elder. The *Shiwen Yuelu* notes: *Zhang* (长) is pronounced like *zhang* (张丈切).\n\nSunshu Ao asked: \"What are they?\"\n\nThe elder replied: \"Those with high rank are envied by others; those with great office are resented by their lord;\n**[Annotation]** The *Shiwen Yuelu* notes: *Wu* (恶) is pronounced like *wu* (乌路切).\n\nthose with generous emoluments are targeted by grievances.\"\n**[Annotation]** Yu Yue notes: The *Huainanzi: Daoying Xun* reads \"禄厚者怨处之\" (those with generous emoluments are the dwelling place of resentment), which is correct. *Chu* (处) means the dwelling place of enmity, akin to saying \"a storehouse of resentment.\" *Chu* rhymes with *du* (妒, envy) and *wu* (恶, resentment).

May this spare me from the three resentments?\"\n\n**[Annotation]** *Shiwen* notes: *Shi* (施) is pronounced like *shi* (始豉切).\n\n**[Exegesis]** To diminish one’s heart is the application of the Dao; to broaden one’s bestowals is the application of virtue. He who applies the Dao to humble himself incurs no resentment; he who applies virtue to bestow universally earns the lord’s favor. From whence could the three resentments arise?\n\nWang Shumin notes: The narrative here is incomplete; there may be missing text.

Below, the text reads, \"the cities fear his frequency,\" with the annotation \"亟 means repeatedly.\" This should be interpreted the same way. Wang Xianqian notes: The *Lüshi Chunqiu: Yibao* reads, \"The king has repeatedly offered me enfeoffment, but I have declined,\" which confirms this reading.\n\n**[Annotation]** *Shiwen* notes: *Ji* (亟) is pronounced like *ji* (纪力切), meaning \"urgent.\"\n\n\"If I die, the king will enfeoff you.

The *Guanzi: Jie* states: \"When Guan Zhong was gravely ill, Duke Huan visited him. Guan Zhong said: 'The states of Jiang and Huang are near Chu.

Ni Que departed and went on his way\"—this serves as evidence. The character \"出\" (*departed*) is simply a miswriting of \"步\" (*walked*).

The bandits pursued him and asked the reason. He replied, \"The noble man does not allow what nourishes him to harm that which he nourishes.\" Tao Hongqing said: The second \"所\" (*that which*) is superfluous; the *Huainanzi*, \"Among the People\" chapter, reads, \"The sage does not allow what nourishes him to harm his nourishment,\" which may be taken as the correct version. Wang Chongmin said: Tao’s view is likely incorrect; rather, the character \"以\" (*with*) is missing below the first \"所.\" The *Zhuangzi*, \"Yielding the Throne\" chapter, states: \"Moreover, I have heard that one does not allow what one employs for nourishment to harm that which one nourishes.\" In the *Master Lü’s Spring and Autumn Annals*, \"Examining Responsibility\" chapter, \"用\" (*employ*) is written as \"以\" (*with*), for *yong* (employ) and *yi* (with) are interchangeable.

      "translated_text": "\"Fan\" is pronounced *fan*.  is pronounced *talà*. In all games where one vies to hit the mark, it is called *she* (to shoot) or *tou* (to cast). Pei Yin states: \"To report the *cai* and obtain the fish.\" According to the *Zhenjing* edition,  is sometimes written as *yu* (fish); the *Dabo Jing* writes it as *die* (flounder), a fish with paired eyes. This likely refers to the two fish as a pair like the flounder’s eyes. Here, it means that upon reporting the *cai* and hitting the mark, one flips the two fish, wins decisively, and laughs. *Die* is pronounced *taliè*. Modern editions that write 鱼 contain an extra character. By meaning, *die* is used, not *yu*; *yu* is used, not *die*.\n\nA kite, flying by, happened to drop its rotten rat and hit him. The *Shiwen* writes *zhui* (to fall) as *dui*, noting: *yuan* is pronounced *yuan*; *shi* is pronounced *zhi*; *dui* is pronounced *zhui*. The knights-errant said to one another: \"The Yu clan has long enjoyed wealth and ease.\" Wang Shumin notes: The *Liu Tie*, *He Bi Shi Lei Bie Ji*, and *Tian Zhong Ji* all include the character *ji* (already) before *jiu* (long). The *Shiwen* notes: *le* is pronounced *luo*. \"Yet they have always harbored the intent to belittle others.\" The *Shiwen* notes: *yi* is pronounced *yichi*. \"We have not provoked them, yet they insult us with a rotten rat. If we do not avenge this, we will have no way to establish our courage in the world.\" The annotation explains: *qin* means courage. The *Shiwen* notes: *qin* is pronounced *qin* and means courage. \"Let us join forces with a single purpose, lead our followers, and surely destroy their household to set an example.\" The character *lu* (to join forces) in the *Sijie* edition is written as *lu*. The *Shiwen* writes *lu* as *lu*, noting: it is pronounced *liu* and means to combine strength. All agreed. On the appointed night, they gathered their forces and weapons to attack the Yu clan, utterly destroying their household. The annotation explains: Arrogance and extravagance lead to disaster through many paths. Though the Yu clan had no intention of oppressing others, their household was ruined, for they had not long practiced the conduct of humility and restraint. The commentary states: The previous chapter spoke of learning benevolence and righteousness through the Three Dynasties to bring about auspiciousness; this chapter speaks of accumulating arrogance and extravagance to invite disaster in a single morning. When one’s conduct is not firmly established, flying calamities strike. There is no fixed gate for fortune or misfortune—each is summoned by the person. These two accounts, presented together, serve as a profound warning. The *Shiwen* writes *jibing* (to gather weapons) as *jingbing* (to gather elite troops), noting: one edition writes *jibing*. *Xing* is pronounced *xiameng*.\n\nIn the east there was a man named Yuan Jingmu. Wang Shumin notes: The *Lüshi Chunqiu* (*Jieli* chapter), *Xinshu* (*Jieshi* chapter), and *Jinlouzi* (*Zaji* chapter) all write *ren* (person) as *shi* (scholar). Jiang Chaobo notes: In Zhang Heng’s *Yingjian*, \"Yuan Jingmu\" is written as \"Jingmao,\" with the line: \"With suspicion in his heart, even fine grain and delicacies he disdains to eat, and so he grows emaciated.\" Bo Jun notes: The commentary to Zhang Heng’s *Biography* writes *jing* as *jing*. The *Xinlun* (*Wangxia* chapter) in the annotations by Yuan Xiaozheng, as well as the *Beishanlu* (*Shibinwen* chapter) and *Yixue* chapter annotations, all write *jing* as *jing*. When he was about to set out on a journey, Wang Shumin notes: The *Taiping Yulan* (499) includes the character *suo* (place) before *shi* (to go), making the meaning more complete. The *Xinshu* (*Jieshi* chapter) also includes *suo*. he starved on the road. A thief from Hufu named Qiu saw him and descended with a gourd of food to feed him. Lu Wenchang notes: The *Zang* edition writes *can* (food) as *sun* (porridge). The *Shiwen* writes *can* as *sun*, noting: *fu* is pronounced *fu*, the same below; *sun* is pronounced *sun* and means water-soaked rice; *bu* is pronounced *fu*. After three feedings, Yuan Jingmu could finally see and asked: \"Who are you?\" Bo Jun notes: The *Xinshu* (*Jieshi* chapter) writes this as \"Who are you?\" He replied: \"I am Qiu from Hufu.\" Jiang Chaobo notes: Hufu is a place name. The *Xunzi* (*Rongru* chapter) states: \"What is called using a Hufu dagger to split cow dung.\" Yang Liang’s annotation: \"Hufu is a place name.\" The *Records of the Grand Historian* states: \"Wu Bei said: The King of Wu’s troops were defeated at Hufu.\" Xu Guang notes: \"Between Liang and Dang.\" Yuan Jingmu said: \"Alas!\"",

      "translated_text": "Lu’s *Shiwen* notes: *xi* is pronounced *xi*. \"Are you not a thief? Why did you feed me?\" The annotation states: \"Feed\" was originally written as *can* (eat); now follows the *Shide Tang* edition’s correction. The *Lüshi Chunqiu* (*Jieli* chapter) also writes it as \"feed.\" Lu’s *Shiwen* notes: *shi* (feed) is pronounced *si*. \"In righteousness, I cannot eat food given by you.\" Pressing both hands to the ground, he retched—*Daozang*’s unannotated edition writes *ou* (retch) as *ou* (vomit). The *Shuowen* states: \"Ou means to spit.\" *Ou* is the vulgar character. Lu’s *Shiwen* notes: *ou* is pronounced with the initial *yi* and final *kou*. Unable to expel it, he choked and gasped, then collapsed and died. Wang Shumin notes: The *Shiwen* edition includes the character *di* (ground); this should be followed. The *Lüshi Chunqiu* (*Jieli* chapter), *Xinshu* (*Jieshi* chapter), and *Jinlouzi* (*Zaji* upper chapter) all include the character *di*. The *Shiwen* writes \"collapsed on the ground and died,\" noting: *ke* is pronounced *ke*. One edition omits the character *di*.\n\nThe man of Hufu was indeed a thief, but the food was not stolen. To call the food stolen because the man was a thief and thus refuse to eat it is to confuse names and realities. [Explanation] Seeking reputation while losing reality, violating the Dao and forfeiting life—is this not what befell Yuan Jingmu? One who embodies the Dao does not act thus. If the thief had transformed his heart to achieve benevolence, personally practiced the Way, and others bathed in his influence, then the gentleman’s rescue would have preserved both lives. To retch and lose both is to choke and spit—how false and foolish!\n\nZhu Lishu served Duke Ao of Ju. Believing himself unappreciated, he left and dwelt by the sea—Northern Song, Wang, Qin block (Lu’s commentary), and *Shide Tang* editions write *qu* (left) as *zhe* (one who). Lu Wenchong notes: The *Zang* edition includes a *qu* (left) after *zi* (self). Tao Hongqing states: After *zi* (self), there should be a *yi* (because), and *zhe* (one who) should be *qu* (left), as the two resemble each other in cursive script. The text should read: \"Believing himself unappreciated, he left and dwelt by the sea.\" Below, it reads: \"His friend said, 'You believed yourself unappreciated, so you left'\"; and \"Zhu Lishu said, 'No. I believed myself unappreciated, so I left. Now to die is to prove I was truly unappreciated.'\" Both support this. Bo Jun notes: The *Lüshi Chunqiu* (*Shijun* chapter) writes: \"Believing himself unappreciated, he left and dwelt by the sea,\" which confirms this. Now, following the *Daozang*’s unannotated edition, Lin Xiyi’s edition, Jiang Yu’s edition, and the Jifu edition, *zhe* is emended to *qu*. The *Shuoyuan* (*Lijie* chapter) writes \"Zhu Lishu\" as \"Zhu Lifu\" and \"Duke Ao\" as \"Duke Mu.\" The *Shiwen* writes: \"Believing himself unappreciated, he dwelt by the sea,\" noting: *ji* (self) is pronounced *ji*. One edition writes: \"and left for the sea.\"\n\nIn summer, he ate water caltrop and water chestnut. Xu Weiyu notes: The *Lüshi Chunqiu* (*Shijun* chapter) writes \"water caltrop and water chestnut\" as \"water caltrop and *qian*.\" Gao You’s annotation: \"Ling is water caltrop. Qian is *ji* (water shield), also called *yan tou* (goose head), growing in water.\" The *Huainanzi* (*Shuoshan* chapter) annotation: \"Ji is water *qian*; in Youzhou, it is called *yan tou*.\" The *Gujin Zhu* states: \"Qian’s leaves resemble lotus but are larger, wrinkled like boiling water, with spiny seeds. The kernels inside can stave off hunger.\" The *Shiwen* notes: *ling* is pronounced *ling*. *Ji* is pronounced with the upper rising tone; one edition writes it as *qian*.\n\nIn winter, he ate acorns. The *Shiwen* notes: *xiang* is pronounced *xiang*.\n\nWhen Duke Ao of Ju faced calamity, the *Shiwen* notes: *nan* (calamity) is pronounced *nan*. Zhu Lishu bid his friend farewell and went to die for him. His friend said: \"You believed yourself unappreciated, so you left. Now you go to die for him—this fails to distinguish between appreciation and lack thereof.\" Zhu Lishu said: \"No. I believed myself unappreciated, so I left. Now to die—\" Tao Hongqing states: After \"believed himself unappreciated,\" there should be a *ji* (self), omitted by the copyist. Bo Jun notes: The *Lüshi Chunqiu* (*Shijun* chapter) also omits *ji*. \"—is to prove I was truly unappreciated. I will die to shame later rulers who fail to recognize their ministers.\" To die for those who appreciate you and not for those who do not—this is to act with straightforward integrity. Zhu Lishu may be called one who resented and forgot himself. [Explanation] Though the duke never appreciated him, he died to prove the duke’s failure to appreciate him—how could this be the conduct of one who embodies the Dao? The folly of being ensnared by reputation is thus great, far from those who preserve life and treasure the Dao.\n\nThe *Shiwen* notes: *dui* is pronounced *dui*. One edition writes *wang* (forgot) as *wang* (lost).\n\nYang Zhu said: \"Benefit given returns in kind. Yu Yue states: *Ji* (reaches) is a miswriting of *fan* (returns). *Chu* (given) and *fan* (returns) are like *wang* (go) and *lai* (come), forming a parallel structure. Mencius said: 'What goes forth from you returns to you.'\" [Annotation] Benefit does not travel alone; resentment does not act in isolation—this is the natural order. What arises within elicits response without—only sincerity. [Annotation] *Qing* (sincerity) should be *qing* (emotion). Emotion’s influence knows no distance, depth, or obscurity. Hong Yi states: The ancient character for *yan* (speech) resembles the seal script for *xin* (heart), so *qing* (emotion) is often miswritten as *qing* (request). The *Shiwen* notes: *qing* is pronounced *jing*. The *Zilin* states: *jing* means sincerity.",

Xu Guang says: The ancient character for *qing* (emotion) was sometimes borrowed as *qing* (request). Therefore, the worthy are cautious in what they emit.\n\n[Annotation] Good deeds manifest and bring auspicious responses; evil accumulates and invites calamity.\n[Exegesis] Only *qing* (emotion/sincerity) is as though self-summoned. The coming of fortune and misfortune is like shadow and echo—thus the worthy are cautious in what they emit.\n\nNowadays, those who admire the Dao all cast aside the teachings of names and rites, lightly abandoning ritual and law. They indulge their emotions and follow their own inclinations, believing this to be mastery of life. They regard benevolence and righteousness as fetters, and dwellings as shackles. They neglect karmic retribution and fail to cultivate human affairs. Thus, men like Ji Kang perished without time to reflect, while those like Sima Yi’s lineage were despised by the world as enemies, yet they knew not the truth!\n\nYangzi’s neighbor lost a sheep. [Bo Jun’s note: The *Taiping Yulan* (195) omits the character “人” (person).] He first led his own party, then asked Yangzi’s servants to join the pursuit. Yangzi said: “Alas! Why so many pursuers for one lost sheep?” The neighbor replied: “There are many branching paths.” Upon returning, Yangzi asked: “Did you retrieve the sheep?” The neighbor said: “It is lost.” Yangzi asked: “Why is it lost?” The neighbor replied: “Among the branching paths there were yet more branches. I knew not where to go, so I returned.”\n\n[Wang Shumin’s note: The *Heguanzi*, in its *Tianquan* chapter commentary, writes “是以” (therefore) instead of “所以” (the reason).]\n\nYangzi’s countenance grew sorrowful and changed; for some time he did not speak, and for the rest of the day he did not smile. His disciples found this strange and asked: “The sheep is a lowly beast, and not even yours to own. Why do you grieve so, diminishing your words and laughter?” Yangzi did not answer. The disciples could not fathom his intent.\n\nDisciple Meng Sunyang went out and told Xin Duzi. Later, Xin Duzi entered with Meng Sunyang and asked: “Once there were three brothers who traveled between Qi and Lu, studying under the same master and advancing in the Way of benevolence and righteousness before returning home. Their father asked: ‘What is the Way of benevolence and righteousness like?’ The eldest said: ‘Benevolence and righteousness make me cherish my body before my reputation.’ [Annotation] One does not dare to harm one’s body, hair, or skin. [Bo Jun’s note: The annotation paraphrases the *Classic of Filial Piety*, “Opening the Manifestation” chapter.] The second said: ‘Benevolence and righteousness make me willing to die to achieve reputation.’ [Annotation] One does not seek life at the expense of benevolence; one dies to fulfill benevolence.

      "translated_text": "“[Explanation:] The sheep is used as an analogy for the spirit; guarding the spirit without loss is the Dao. Once one loses the sheep and rushes about on branching paths, it cannot be recovered. Simply guarding one’s spirit is to be without loss or gain, and thus without dependence. Those who pursue仁义 (*ren-yi*, benevolence and righteousness) through many paths are likewise.\n\nYang Zhu’s younger brother was named Bu. He wore plain white clothes when he went out. [Annotation: The first *yi* (‘wore’) in *yi su yi* (‘wore plain white clothes’) is pronounced *yì* (like *yì* in ‘clothing’); the same applies below to *yi zi yi* (‘wore black clothes’). The second *yi* in *su yi* (‘plain white clothes’) is read literally.] It rained, so he took off his plain white clothes and put on black ones before returning. His dog, not recognizing him, ran out and barked. Yang Bu grew angry and was about to strike it. [Annotation by Lu Wenchang: In the *Zang* edition, *pu* (‘strike’) is written as *po*; the same below. The *Shiwen* notes that *pu* is written as *po* and pronounced *piàn-bǔ*.] Yang Zhu said: ‘Do not strike it! You would do the same. If your dog had gone out white and returned black, how could you not find it strange?’\n\n[Commentary:] This passage illustrates that when one’s own form changes, external things cannot comprehend it, giving rise to judgments of right and wrong. To not seek within oneself but instead place heavy blame on others is like Yang Bu, who changed his clothes and was surprised by his dog’s barking. [Annotation: In the *Zang* edition, *hou ze* (‘heavy blame’) is written as *zhuan ze* (‘exclusive blame’).]\n\n[Explanation:] When one guards authenticity and returns to unity, even seagulls may be tamed; but if one loses the Dao and alters the constant, even a household dog may become fearful. [Annotation by Xu Weiyu: In the *Han Feizi*, *Shuo Lin Xia*, the character *zi* (‘you’) appears before *qi* (‘how’), which better suits the meaning.

Wang Shumin notes: Lin Xi Yi’s *Kou Yi* reads, ‘If one saw a white dog become black,’ suggesting that the edition he saw also included the character *jian*.]\n\nYang Zhu said: ‘Act with goodness not for the sake of fame, yet fame follows; fame does not seek profit, yet profit accrues.’”",

      "translated_text": "“Profit does not seek contention, yet contention comes to it. [The *Shiwen* reads: *zheng* is pronounced *zhèng*; the same below.] Thus the noble person must be cautious in doing good.”\n\n[Annotation:] In matters of wisdom, others will contend with him; in matters of strength, others will vie against him—this is the natural course of events. There has never been one who dwells at the crossroads of fame and profit yet avoids calamity. As the saying goes, “In doing good, do not draw near to fame”—how can this not be true?\n\n[Exegesis:] The goodness that seeks fame is what all contend for. Thus, “in doing good, do not draw near to fame” means not to vie with others for profit. To practice what others cannot practice without boasting—this is to be cautious in doing good.\n\nLu Wenchang notes: In the annotation, the *Zang* edition reads “at the center of profit and fame” instead of “at the crossroads of fame and profit,” and includes the character *er* (‘and’) after *zhong* (‘center’).\n\nBo Jun observes: The *Shuo Yuan*, in its *Jing Shen* chapter, records words by Wei Gongzi Mou that closely resemble this passage.\n\n[The *Shiwen* reads: *nan* is pronounced *nǎndàn*.]\n\nFormerly, there was one who claimed to know the Way to immortality. [The *Daozang* unannotated edition, Lin Xiyi’s edition, and the Jifu edition include the character *you* (‘there’) after *ren* (‘one’); the Northern Song edition, the *Daozang Sijie* edition, Jiang Yue’s edition, the Shidetang edition, and Wang’s edition omit it.] Tao Hongqing said: The characters *yan you* (‘claimed to know’) are transposed in error. Wang Chongmin said: Tao’s view is incorrect; the character *you* (‘there’) is merely missing after *ren* (‘one’). The *Daozang* and Jifu editions both include *you* after *ren*.\n\nBo Jun observes: Following Wang’s reading, if rendered as “formerly, there was one who claimed to know the Way to immortality,” then the one who knew the Way and the one who spoke would be two different people. This would not align with the subsequent text, where the speaker dies. Tao’s reading is closer to the mark.\n\nThe Lord of Yan sent someone to learn it. Before success was achieved, the speaker died. [Bo Jun observes: The *Han Feizi*, in its *Wai Chu Shuo Zuo Shang* chapter, reads: “The scholar he sent had not yet finished learning when he died abroad. The king was enraged and executed him.”]\n\n[The *Shiwen* reads: *jie* is pronounced *yì*.]\n\nThe Lord of Yan was furious and intended to execute his envoy.\n\n[The *Shiwen* reads: *shi* is pronounced *shì*.]\n\nA favored minister admonished him, saying: “Nothing concerns people more urgently than death, and nothing do they value more than life. He himself lost his life—how could he have enabled you to avoid death?” Thus, he was not executed.\n\nThere was a man of Qi who also wished to learn the Way. When he heard that the speaker had died, he struck his chest in regret. Fuzi, hearing of this, laughed and said: “He desired to learn the Way to immortality, yet when the man died, he still regretted it—this is to not understand the purpose of learning.”\n\nHuzi said: “Fuzi’s words are wrong. There are those who possess a method but cannot practice it, and there are those who can practice it but lack the method. There was a man of Wei skilled in calculation who, on the verge of death, explained the method to his son in detail.”",

The son memorized his father’s words but could not practice them. When others asked him, he relayed what his father had said.

      "translated_text": "Jianzi said, \"Releasing creatures on the first morning of the new year demonstrates benevolence.\" The guest replied, \"The people, knowing that you wish to release them, *compete to capture them*—thus many die. If you truly wish to preserve their lives, it would be better to forbid the people from capturing them at all. To capture and then release them is a benevolence that cannot compensate for the harm done.\"\n\nJianzi said, \"You are right.\"\n\n**Explanation:** When people know how to perform good deeds, they focus only on superficial acts. If one addresses the root, though few may understand, the benefit far exceeds that of tending to the branches. Thus, small acts of kindness are but thieves of true benevolence. The traces of moral teachings attend to the branches; the power of the Great Dao attends to the root. Most people see only the small and fail to recognize the great—hence this example of releasing doves is given to clarify this grand principle.\n\nThe Tian clan of Qi performed ancestral rites in their courtyard, hosting a thousand guests. During the feast, someone presented fish and geese. The patriarch sighed and said, \"How generous is Heaven toward the people! It cultivates the five grains and brings forth fish and birds for their use.\" The guests echoed his words in unison.\n\nBao’s son, twelve years old, was among the attendants. He stepped forward and said, \"It is not as you say. Heaven and earth, the myriad things, and we ourselves are born together as the same kind. There is no nobility or baseness among kinds—only self-regard that leads to mutual disdain. It is merely by differences in size and strength that they dominate one another, devouring each other in turn. They are not born for one another’s sake. Humans take what is edible and eat it—was it truly Heaven’s intent to create them for human consumption? Moreover, mosquitoes and gnats pierce our skin, tigers and wolves devour flesh—was it Heaven’s intent to create humans for mosquitoes and gnats, or flesh for tigers and wolves?\"\n\n**Explanation:** That creatures of prey consume one another extinguishes Heaven’s principle—how could this be Heaven’s will? Bao’s son spoke rightly to the heart of the matter. There was once a vulgar scholar who claimed that Fuxi invented nets and traps, and Suiren cooked meat for food. Yet these two emperors were sages—how far are sages from tigers that eat flesh? The sutras of the Buddha are not like the teachings of China’s sages, which restrain people for their benefit. The Buddha possesses the six penetrations, while the sages’ teachings restrain perception for the sake of liberating sentient beings. Now, the *Liezi* once again clarifies this principle—thus the teachings of the Great Dao have never differed.\n\nA poor man in Qi was accustomed to begging in the marketplace. The townspeople, weary of his frequent appeals, gave him nothing. He then went to the Tian clan’s stables, where he worked alongside the stablehands and borrowed food. Someone in the capital mocked him, saying, \"To eat by serving the stablehands—is this not shameful?\" The beggar replied, \"There is no greater shame in the world than begging.\"",

      "translated_text": "The beggar said, \"If even begging is not shameful, how could serving the stablehands be shameful?\" The note explains: he did not consider working for the stablehands a disgrace. This chapter illustrates that when things reach their extreme, divisions are already fixed, and thus all sense of honor and shame is lost—how much more so for those who naturally level gain and loss?\n\nThe commentary states: There are scholars who break their limbs or lick sores to gain advancement, all for the sake of clothing and food. Those who labor at the gates of lowly physicians also seek clothing and food. If they gain much profit, they consider it honor; if little, they consider it shame. Yet who among people truly understands the reality of honor and shame?\n\nQin Enfu notes: In the commentary, \"breaking limbs\" refers to \"breaking branches.\" Mencius says, \"To break a branch for an elder.\" Zhao Qi’s annotation explains: \"Breaking branches means massaging the joints to relieve fatigue.\"\n\nThere was a man from Song who, while traveling on the road, found a discarded wooden tally. The note explains: \"discarded\" means abandoned. Wang Chongmin observes: The *Taiping Yulan* (499) omits the character \"traveling.\" The tally was a notched piece of wood used to record matters. He took it home and hid it, secretly counting its teeth. The note explains: the notches resembled teeth. Wang Zhong comments: According to the note, the \"tally\" here refers to the carved notches, synonymous with \"engraving.\" Yang Bojun notes: The matching parts of a tally are its teeth, used to verify authenticity. The *Yilin* states: \"The left tally matches the right, their teeth aligning.\" Thus, upon finding the tally, the man secretly counted its teeth. He told his neighbor, \"I shall soon be rich!\" The note explains: Those who use empty names to seek real gain are like holding a discarded tally to claim wealth.\n\nThe commentary states: Ordinary people, deluded by empty names and losing sight of truth, are all like picking up a lost wooden tally, counting its notches to await riches. They are also like those who feel no shame in begging in the marketplace yet feel shame in serving others. How is this different from a runaway slave abandoning his master to serve another? The labor is no different, yet he believes himself no longer bound to anyone. Following deluded emotions while losing true principle—such is the nature of all these cases.\n\nThere was a man with a withered parasol tree. His neighbor, an elder, said that withered parasol trees were inauspicious. Yang Bojun notes: The *Lüshi Chunqiu* (*Qu You* chapter) uses \"good\" instead of \"auspicious.\" The neighbor hastily chopped it down. The note explains: Though his words were fair, he spoke out of place. Yu Yue argues: The character \"neighbor\" is superfluous. Above, it says \"a man had a withered parasol tree,\" and here it says \"his man,\" referring to this same person. The \"neighbor elder\" mentioned throughout refers to this man’s neighbor—how could it then refer to the neighbor as \"this man\"? Below, it says, \"The man was displeased, saying...\"—also without the character \"neighbor,\" proving that \"neighbor\" here is extraneous. The neighbor elder then asked to take it as firewood. The note explains: He further treads a dubious path. Wang Shumin observes: The *Liu Tie* (16) omits the character \"man,\" and the current text’s \"man\" may be an interpolation from the surrounding text. The *Lüshi Chunqiu* (*Qu You* chapter) also omits \"man.\" The man was displeased, saying, \"The neighbor elder merely wanted firewood and thus urged me to cut it down. Living beside me, how treacherous he is—how can this be?\" The note explains: In doubtful matters, things cannot be trusted.\n\nThe commentary states: Urging him to cut the tree was a fair suggestion; asking for it as firewood was reasonable. Yet urging its felling while requesting it raised suspicions of ulterior motives. Thus it is said: What people fear, one must fear. Do not think it harmless—its misfortune will grow. This is what it means.\n\nThere was a man who lost his axe. The note explains: \"axe\" refers to a hatchet. He suspected his neighbor’s son. Yang Bojun notes: There should be a \"man\" after \"neighbor,\" as below it also says \"neighbor’s son,\" and the *Taiping Yulan* (763) renders it as \"neighbor’s son,\" though it omits \"of,\" the character \"man\" is not missing. He observed the son’s gait—he had stolen the axe; his complexion—he had stolen the axe; his speech—he had stolen the axe; his movements and demeanor—nothing did not suggest he had stolen the axe. The *Sibu Congkan* edition omits \"gait.\" Wang Chongmin notes: The *Taiping Yulan* (763) renders \"movements and demeanor\" as \"demeanor and movements,\" which is correct. Below, it says, \"Another day, he saw his neighbor’s son again, and his demeanor and movements no longer resembled those of an axe thief.\" Yang Bojun notes: The *Lüshi Chunqiu* (*Qu You* chapter) also uses \"demeanor and movements.\" Wang’s observation is correct. Here, following Lu Chongxuan’s edition and the *Daozang Sijie* edition for emendation. The *Shiwen Leiju* (Bieji 18) and *He Bi Shilei* (Xuxi 33) also use \"demeanor and movements.\" Soon after, he dug in his valley and found his axe. Another day, he saw his neighbor’s son again. Wang Shumin notes: The *Taiping Yulan* (763), *Jizuan Yuanhai* (55, 59), *Shiwen Leiju* (Bieji 18), and *He Bi Shilei* (Xuxi 33) all omit the character \"man.\" His demeanor and movements no longer resembled those of an axe thief.",

      "translated_text": "His demeanor and movements no longer resembled those of an axe thief.\n\n**Note:** When the mind is biased and deluded, it shifts and alters with one’s thoughts and intentions. In extreme cases, white and black become indistinguishable, square and round merge in form—how could this be a change in external things? Thus, the saying goes: the myriad affairs, tangled and confused, all arise from the mind.\n\n**Exegesis:** Many misfortunes stem from doubts and resemblances. Even the fall of a kite or a mouse may breed suspicion and disaster. Only those who accumulate virtue, uphold the Dao, and remain impartial and selfless can avoid such calamities. The case of losing an axe and suspecting a neighbor is but one example.\n\n**Note (variant):** The phrase *\"how could this be a change in external things\"* appears in the *Daozang Sijie* edition as *\"how could external things have the power to change them?\"*\n\n**Phonetic Gloss:** *fù* (復), *fúyòu* (扶又) cut.\n\nWhen Viscount Bai of Shen plotted rebellion,\n\n**Note:** *Lǜ* (慮) means \"to consider\" or \"to scheme,\" here referring to plotting rebellion.\n\n**Phonetic Gloss:** *shèng* (勝), *shīzhèng* (詩證) cut.\n\nhe left court and stood, leaning on his staff upside down, its spike piercing his chin.\n\n**Note:** *zhuì* (錣) refers to the pointed tip of a staff.\n\n**Pei Jun’s Note:** The *Hanfeizi* (*Yu Lao* chapter) reads: *\"He left court, inverted his staff, and its spike pierced his chin.\"*\n\n**Phonetic Gloss:** *zhuì* (錣), *zhāngliè* (張劣) cut. Xu Shen’s commentary on the *Huainanzi* states: *\"A horse whip has a sharp iron tip to prod a horse that refuses to advance.\"*\n\nBlood flowed to the ground, yet he was unaware. A man of Zheng, hearing of this, said: *\"If one can forget one’s chin, what else could one not forget?\"*\n\n**Note:** In the Northern Song edition and the *Shide Tang* edition, *\"chin\"* (頤) appears as *\"head\"* (頭).\n\nWhen the mind is fixated, one’s steps may stumble over roots or pits,\n\n**Phonetic Gloss:** *zhǔ* (屬), *zhú* (烛) sound. *zhuó* (著), *zhíluè* (直略) cut. *zhì* (踬), \"to stumble.\" *kǎn* (埳), \"pit.\"\n\none’s head may strike a wooden post, yet one remains oblivious.\n\n**Pei Jun’s Note:** The passage *\"When the mind is fixated...\"* also appears in the *Huainanzi* (*Yuandao Xun*).\n\n**Phonetic Gloss:** *dǐ* (抵), *dīnglǐ* (丁礼) cut.\n\nLong ago, a man of Qi coveted gold. At dawn, he dressed and went to the market. Arriving at the gold vendor’s stall, he seized the gold and left.\n\n**Phonetic Gloss:** *yìguān* (衣冠), both in departing tone. *yù* (鬻), *yù* (育) sound.\n\nThe authorities arrested him and asked: *\"With people all around, why did you seize another’s gold?\"*\n\n**Wang Chongmin’s Note:** The *Leiju* (83), *Taiping Yulan* (810), and *Lüshi Chunqiu* all include the word *\"reason\"* (故) after *\"why\"* (何). The *Huainanzi* (*Fanlun Xun*) reads *\"why\"* (何故) as *\"what\"* (何也).\n\n**Wang Shumin’s Note:** The *Liushitie* (8), *Shilei Fu* (9), *Jizuan Yuanhai* (1, 55), *Shiwen Leiju Xuxi* (25), and *Tianzhong Ji* (50) all include the word *\"reason\"* (故).\n\n**Phonetic Gloss:** The text reads: *\"Why did you seize another’s gold?\"* (子攫人之金何故), with a variant omitting *\"reason\"* (故).\n\nHe replied: *\"When I took the gold, I saw no one—only the gold.\"*\n\n**Note:** The chaos wrought by craving and desire upon the human heart is this severe. Thus, the ancients said: *\"One who examines the tip of an autumn hair cannot see the form of Mount Tai; one who tunes the harmony of the five notes cannot hear the sound of thunder. When the mind is ensnared by the myriad things and attached to externals, even great forms and sounds may be overlooked. How much more so for one whose heart strays from principle, who restrains emotions and gathers thoughts, abiding in tranquil stillness—how could the movements of the myriad things disturb them?\"*\n\n**Exegesis:** Zhang Zhan states: *\"The chaos wrought by craving and desire upon the human heart is this severe. Thus, it is said: 'One who examines the tip of an autumn hair cannot see the form of Mount Tai; one who listens to the harmony of the five notes cannot hear the sound of thunder.' When the mind is fixed on something, the body may be forgotten—all such cases are like this.\"* This chapter speaks of the great harm in indulging desires, which can destroy the body and extinguish one’s nature. Now, one seeks to enrich the self with that which destroys it. If one could be without self, what need would there be for gold? To speak of being without self is not to destroy the self, but merely not to indulge it.\n\n**Note:** In the *Daozang Sijie* edition, the word *\"thus\"* (因) appears after *\"how\"* (豈), likely in error.\n\n**Lu Wenchang’s Note:** The word *\"thing\"* (物) in the note may be superfluous.\n\n**Pei Jun’s Note:** Lu’s suggestion is uncertain. It is likely that *\"the movements of the myriad things\"* (萬物動之) should read *\"the movements of the myriad things\"* (萬物之動), with *\"movements\"* (動) and *\"of\"* (之) transposed.\n\n**Phonetic Gloss:** *zhuó* (著), *zhíluè* (直略) cut. *bó* (泊), *hún* (魂) sound, meaning \"tranquil and composed.\"",
