Falsely attributed to the Supreme Lord Lao, it expounds methods of reciting scriptures, chanting incantations, and visualizing spirits to guard the body. One scroll.\n\n**Source:** *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Section of Esoteric Methods*, *Category of Methods*.\n\n---\n\nThe Supreme Lord Lao said:\nThe Great Dao is formless, ever dwelling in profound obscurity. It transforms beings in response to sincerity. If you can still your thoughts and receive this true scripture, those who uphold it will purify their mouths and clarify their spirits. Only then should they recite it—no evil shall arise, illnesses may be cured, and longevity extended. A hundred demons shall not intrude, and all malevolent spirits shall be bound. This is so because all sentient beings who receive this true scripture shall attain long life.\n\nNow, within this, one must refine the body with discipline, constantly still the three karmas, and settle the six emotions. Naturally, the five spirits shall guard you, and the Three Ones shall abide eternally. Whether sitting or lying, you shall be at peace, your hun and po souls tranquil. Recite this scripture thrice at dawn and dusk—your ears shall hear clearly, your eyes see sharply, your body grow strong, and your form light. All is as described below; listen carefully.\n\nThe Supreme Lord Lao said:\nWithin your body dwell thirty-six thousand spirits. On the left, three *hun* souls; on the right, seven *po* souls. Your body bears one thousand two hundred forms and shadows, your frame ten thousand two hundred luminous essences. The five viscera and six bowels, the twenty-four spirits—constantly visualize them, never allowing them to depart. If afflicted by illness, call upon them thrice, and their true forms shall descend.\n\nThe Supreme Lord Lao said:\nShould you wish to transcend the three disasters and nine calamities, recite these words:\n*\"I take Heaven as my father and Earth as my mother. I dwell between them, ever like a newborn child. The sun is my functionary, the moon my scribe. The messengers of Thunder dwell at my left and right; the Lords of Wind and Rain stand before and behind me. The Six Jia spirits encircle me; the Azure Dragon supports my left, the White Tiger attends my right. The Vermilion Bird leads before me, the Dark Warrior follows behind. The Northern Dipper covers my head, the Celestial Stem points to my crown. The Coiling Serpent lies at my feet, eliminating misfortune for me.*\n\n*I dwell within the cinnabar chamber, the Great One as my companion. Three on the left, seven on the right; nine above, one below. Two and four form my shoulders, six and eight my feet. I reside in the Central Palace, filling my abdomen. Now I command the thousand ghosts and ten thousand spirits—return to your native realms! Those who oppose me shall die; those who turn from me shall perish. Flee swiftly, hide in the depths! Mighty Ding warriors, slay and eradicate all inauspicious omens!\"*\n\n*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law!*\n\nThe Supreme Lord Lao said:\nAt the hour of sleep, summon the Four Beasts to guard your body:\n*\"The Azure Dragon emerges from my liver, standing at my left;\nThe White Tiger emerges from my lungs, standing at my right;\nThe Vermilion Bird emerges from my heart, standing before me;\nThe Dark Warrior emerges from my kidneys, standing behind me.*\n\n*You Four Beasts, sharpen your fangs and grind your teeth! Stand at my left and right, before and behind, repelling all malevolent spirits and demonic ghosts. Let none dare recklessly approach my jade chamber, that I may sit and lie in peace, free from nightmares.\"*\n\n*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law!*\n\nThe Supreme Lord Lao said:\nWhen the recitation is complete, return the spirits:\n*\"The liver governs the *hun* souls, the lungs govern the *po* souls, the heart governs the spirit, the spleen governs intention, the kidneys govern essence. The Azure Dragon returns to my liver, the Vermilion Bird to my heart, the White Tiger to my lungs, the Dark Warrior to my kidneys. The Yellow Dragon guards my spleen, filling my abdomen. No evil spirits or malevolent ghosts may dwell below.\"*\n\n*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law!*\n\nThe Supreme Lord Lao said:\nAfter returning the spirits, strike the Heavenly Drum thirty-six times and swallow saliva thirty-six times. Then hold your breath, counting silently from one to ten, stopping at nine. Visualize a crimson *qi* emerging from your mouth like a flame, wheeling and spreading throughout the chamber. When settled, inwardly contemplate it, and you shall naturally rest in peace.\n\nBy practicing this constantly, you shall be forever free from illness. A thousand disasters and ten thousand demons shall not dare approach. Aligned with the Dao, you shall attain long life and enduring vision. Your descendants shall flourish in joy, wealth and honor shall daily increase. Golden chariots shall enter your gate, official rank shall rise, and your salary shall reach the Three Dukes. With a loyal heart and filial devotion, you shall assist the Emperor.\n\n*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the Supreme Lady of the Azure Writ!*\n\nHere ends *The Supreme Lord Lao’s Wondrous Esoteric Scripture of Inner Virtue and Divine Incantations from the Pillow*.",
