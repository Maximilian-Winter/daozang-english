  "full_translation": "*The Secret Method of Zhuge Wuhou for the Five Thunders of Loyalty and Filial Piety, Linked to the Dipper*\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Secret Method of Zhuge Wuhou for the Five Thunders of Loyalty and Filial Piety, Linked to the Dipper*\n**Author:** Zhang Huiqi of the Yuan dynasty\n**Volume:** One\n**Source Text:** *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongxuan Section*, *Category of Various Arts*\n\n**Preface to *The Secret Method of Zhuge Wuhou for the Five Thunders of Loyalty and Filial Piety, Linked to the Dipper***\n*Composed by Wu Sheng, Perfected Master of Preserved Radiance of the Rising Sun*\n\nDoes the Yi circulate through the positions set by Heaven and Earth? The Dao within them abides in Heaven and Earth, yet its laws extend beyond all bounds. The Two Modes and Four Images take root in yin and yang; the Eight Trigrams and Nine Palaces interweave with divine subtlety. The qi mechanisms of the myriad things differ, yet all converge in the Thunder Citadel. The twelve gates of fortune and misfortune lie in the handle of the Dipper; the nine and six positions govern life and death. Only the perfected one grasps the pivot of creation and transformation, knowing the conditions of ghosts and spirits. Thus may one dispel evil without doubt, maintaining utmost purity and unity, and devote oneself to the Dao.\n\nDuring the Zhiyuan era of the Yuan dynasty, Zhang Huiqi, a tribute scholar from Jingmen, was well-versed in the classics and taught in his hometown. While lodging in a villager’s home, he fished in the river and obtained a smooth, lustrous stone, which he placed in the inner chamber. One night, as he sat in meditation, he saw it radiate a brilliant light. He spent his lodging stipend to purchase it and took it home. Upon splitting it open, he found within a square stone resembling iron, inscribed on both sides. After carving, scraping, washing, and polishing, the characters emerged as if stamped in ink. He printed several hundred sheets, and when he burned them, the smoke billowed thickly. Startled, he was overcome with dizziness.\n\nIn his sleep, he suddenly saw a deity—majestic and imposing, clad in a feathered cloak and silk headscarf—stride forward and brandish an iron ruyi, saying: *\"Have you heard of Zhuge Kongming of the Han? The Emperor has commanded me as the Great Thunder Deity of Heavenly Communication, Execution, and Fierce Punishment. This is the Seal of Yin-Yang Spirits. Since you have obtained it, you must aid the Two Ways in propagating the law. When mountain goblins, stone specters, or earthen and wooden spirits invade homes and harm the people, use this divine seal to summon my Loyalty and Filial Piety Thunder Soldiers. Follow the positions of the Yu-Luo Scripture: one Kan, two Kun, three Zhen, four Xun, five Center, six Qian, seven Dui, eight Gen, nine Li. According to the seasons, yin-yang, and the cycles of reversal and compliance, burn the seal. Begin at Kan and end at Li, then begin at Li and end at Kan—this is what is meant by the clash of thunder, wind, water, and fire, by which all perverse spirits will be eradicated. I now bestow this scripture upon you; treasure it well.\"*\n\nAwakening, the master leapt up in reverence, bowing to receive the text.\n\nThus, he abandoned the secular world and entered Mount Wudang to follow the Dao and delve into the Heavenly Heart Orthodox Dharma, bringing fortune to the state and well-being to the people, his reputation resounding throughout the court and countryside. During the Dade era, he was enfeoffed as the Hidden Perfected One, the True Yang Perfected, and ascended in seated meditation from the Southern Peak. His disciples built a shrine to honor him, petitioning the court to bestow the name \"Ascending Perfection Abbey.\" Two years later, lightning flashed and thunder roared as the divine seal flew away.\n\nThe Fire Bell Complete Yang Perfected, Master Zhao, received the transmission after a thunderbolt split a jujube tree, carving the seal to propagate the Dharma across rivers and lakes. At Mount Yuji, he achieved transformation in stillness. The lineage passed next to the Valley Yang Perfected, Master Huang, under whom the Dharma flourished ever more brightly. During the Tianli era, it emerged at Mount Yin in Yangzhou. By the Xinma year of the Zhizheng reign, when troops rose in Qizhou and Yingzhou, he retired to the Western Mountains of Hongdu. On the Shangyuan Festival of the Jiyou year, he sat in perilous posture and transcended as an immortal.\n\nIn my youth, I had the fortune to attend his teachings. Here, I do not obscure his merit in benefiting the world without self-praise, nor his deeds in aiding people and profiting all things. Moreover, just as Marquis Wu achieved fame through the Eight Formations, his merit overshadowing the Three Kingdoms, his unity of lord and minister illuminated the annals of history—knowing advance and retreat, life and death, without losing rectitude, he delved deeply into the profound subtleties of the *Yi Jing*’s images and laws. A hundred generations hence, he is still summoned by the imperial court for his valor, integrity, and uprightness, his decrees spreading across the land, his majestic command expelling demons and monsters, his radiant spirit shining above—how awe-inspiring! How could one fail to revere him?\n\n**The Secret Dharma of the Loyalty and Filiality Five-Thunder Marquis Wu**\n**Presiding Deity:** The Primordial Lady of the Nine Heavens, the True and Mysterious Weaver of the Great Loom.\n**Commander:** The Nine Heavens’ Aiding Dao, Valiant and Upright Thunder Deity of Fierce Execution, Supreme General of the Celestial Armies, the Loyal and Martial Marquis Wu of Nanyang, Zhuge Liang, styled Kongming.\n**Deputy Commanders:**\n- Deputy Thunder General, Former General Guan Yu.\n- Deputy Thunder General, Right General Zhang Fei.\n- Deputy Thunder General, Left General Huang Zhong.\n- Deputy Thunder General, General of the Western Expedition, Ma Chao.\n- Deputy Thunder General, Tiger Might General Zhao Yun.\n\n**Officers and Troops:**\n- The Thirty-Six Thunder Generals of Tianpeng.\n- The Seventy-Two Generals of Yin Thunder.\n- The Marshals of the Six Ding and Six Jia.\n- The Seventeen Divine Kings and Five Tiger Mighty Generals.\n- The Thunder Soldiers of the Nine Palaces, Eight Gates, and Eight Formations.\n- The Iron-Armored Generals of the Five Directions’ Sequential Jia.\n- The Five Thunder Commanders of the Five Phases—Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth—governing the qi of generation, prosperity, destruction, decline, and death.\n- The Spirit Lords of the Yearly Dragon and Monthly Generals.\n- The Spirit Lords of the Seventy-Two Seasons and Twenty-Four Qi.\n- The Officers of the Year, Month, Day, and Hour, who expel evil and assist rectitude.\n- The Loyalty and Filiality Thunder Soldiers of the Eight Directions’ Thunderclaps.\n\n**Summoning Ritual:**\nFirst, recite the Three Purifications Mantra, then:\n*\"Heaven is clear, Earth is tranquil,\nThe Six Ding and Six Jia slay demonic spirits.\nWhoever dares defy our Dao,\nThe True Lord Tianpeng shall obliterate your form.\"*\n\nLight one stick of Dao incense, purifying the ten directions. Strike the ritual drum thrice, and all spirits shall heed the command.\n\nNow, as this incense burns, I invoke the Messenger of the Current Day and Hour, the officers of the Six Ding and Six Jia, the Attendant Pure Maidens, and the Altar’s Earth Deity to bear this offering of faith. May the incense ascend, and swiftly summon the Presiding Deity, the Primordial Lady of the Nine Heavens, the True and Mysterious Weaver of the Great Loom. Urgently command the arrival of the Commander, the Fierce Thunder Deity of Execution and Supreme General; the Deputy Thunder Generals—Former General Guan Yu, Right General Zhang Fei, Left General Huang Zhong, General of the Western Expedition Ma Chao, and Tiger Might General Zhao Yun—to descend before the altar and receive orders.\n\n**Divine Transformation:**\n*\"Great Emperor of the Heavenly Sovereign,\nSwiftly transform my spirit.\"*\n\nAs the Thunder Envoy, I command and marshal the Thunder Soldiers. I dispatch the Thunder Officers, aligning above with the Heart of Heaven. *Swiftly, swiftly, as the Heavenly Sovereign’s thunderous decree—like the thunderbolt of Gaya—commands transformation!*\n\nWhite qi, primordial and chaotic, bathes my form; with Yu’s steps, I ascend into the Radiant Yang. Heaven revolves and earth turns as I tread the Seven Stars; stepping upon the *Gang* and soaring through the Dipper, I ascend to the Nine Ages. Evil rebels are subdued, and demonic forces topple; ten thousand calamities dare not approach my eternal life. I attain immortality and abide in the Court of Blessings, revolving the heavens and overturning the earth, where ghosts vanish without trace. Ten thousand spirits assist me in slaying demonic essences.\n\n*Swiftly, swiftly, as the Heavenly Sovereign’s divine decree commands!*\n\nSummoning the left hand’s *Sha* script and the right hand’s sword mudra, I visualize the Six Metal Stars crowning my head, the *Chen-Xu* and *Xu-Chen* Dipper constellations shielding my body.\n\nRecite the incantation:\n*\"The Jade Emperor’s decree converges; heaven and earth merge in primordial chaos. The Five Qi intertwine, endlessly transforming. Gazing through the Three Realms, the Eight Ministries and Nine Palaces, the Five Thunder Lords and the Four-Eyed Elder. Swiftly summon the Thunder Marshal—thunderbolts fly through the sky, galloping thunder and racing lightning, hurling fire and surging wind. A hundred thousand troops, fierce steeds and venomous dragons, the Black Poison Envoys, scour and seize demonic fiends. The Nine Palaces’ seas boil; the sacred sword gleams with its edge. Commanding the mountains and rivers, annihilating the traces of evil. Heavenly Soldiers enforce the law; divine might manifests left and right. The Nine Uglies and Eight Ramparts summon winds in boundless vastness. Kunlun trembles; jade flutes and golden bells resound. Demon kings bow their heads; leaping fire ascends the sky. The Ten Spirits of Taiyi come to slay the Yellow Slaves; Yin and Yang harmonize as the *Gang* and Dipper align in reverence. The Ten Directions heed the command—thunder and lightning roar, great quakes and thunderclaps sweep away demonic evil.\"*\n\n*Dū xū xū lì jiè □ yǔn □...*\n\n*Urgent summons: Commander, Deputy Thunder General—Former General Guan Yu; Deputy Thunder General—Right General Zhang Fei; Deputy Thunder General—Left General Huang Zhong; Deputy Thunder General—General of the Western Expedition Ma Chao; Deputy Thunder General—Tiger Might General Zhao Yun—hasten to the altar to receive orders!*\n\nConcentrate the spirit, transcend the Supreme Ultimate; above and below merge in golden light, a single qi enveloping heaven and earth, supporting the Jade Emperor in divine stillness. Qi ascends as I visualize: in the west, a Metal Star, vast as a chariot wheel, its radiance piercing the Ten Directions. Within it, thunder resounds; light shoots forth before the altar, and the Marshal emerges from the brilliance.\n\nRecite the incantation:\n*\"Essence of the Supreme Mystery, heaven and earth unite as one. Mother and Moon conjoin; the Two Qi blend in misty harmony. The myriad forms of the cosmos array in stellar splendor. Divine winds vast and boundless, the Great Black Poison Spirit. Thunder’s decree commands—summon the Thunder Soldiers! Hear my edict and manifest in response. Shake the startling thunderbolt; wield lightning and soar through clouds. Slay evil, shatter temples, seize ghosts and capture spirits. At the first command, reduce them to dust.\"*\n\n*Oṃ □ cāṃ śrī li wǔ biàn...*\n\n*Swiftly, swiftly, as the Thunderbolt Subduer of Demons, Supreme Minister of the True Lord, decrees!*\n\nThree flashes of lightning—my body stands within the radiance of thunder and fire. I visualize the Marshal’s celestial and majestic countenance: brows like the Five Peaks, apricot-shaped eyes, a peach-red nine-leaf silk headscarf. In his left hand, an iron *ruyi*; in his right, a white feather fan. Clad in white robes with crimson lining, he rides forth from golden light upon a white steed, the Five Generals in attendance. Divine officers follow as he descends from the west to the altar, ready to dispatch at will.\n\n**Three Summons to the Seventeen Divine Kings Incantation:**\n*Sarva hā viḍeha hā suvarṇa dvāra hā pavanā, Go-headed Da, Golden-headed Da Sarva nā, Mahāpāśa hā sarva li, Horse-headed Ajaḍa pāli, Liha-headed Mahāyūla Mahākāla Kāla Vidyā.*\n\n*Swiftly, by the decree of Thunder and Fire!*\n\n**Entering the Rite, Dispatching the Seal, and Transforming the Memorial:**\nHaving issued the summons, I envision their arrival at the altar. Now, with memorial in hand, I address the Marshal: *\"Hear these matters. With this seal and talisman now presented, I invoke the Marshal to shake the ringing bells, hurl fire, wield lightning, and ride the clouds. Donning armor and brandishing weapons, let thunder roar and lightning crash, clouds gather and mists converge. Proceed to [location] to execute your duty. How shall it be carried out? The deadline is set for [date], awaiting divine response as proof. By imperial mandate, you hold the seal and command the authority of thunder’s decree, judging the unruly affairs of ghosts and spirits. Your orders must be swift as shooting stars; your law spread as swiftly as wind and thunder. The Three Realms shall not delay; within a moment, the response shall be manifest and clear.\"*\n\nThree flashes of lightning—behold the Primordial Marshal: his face like spattered blood, clad in a mirror-like golden armor. In his right hand, an iron halberd; in his left, an iron *ruyi*. He rides an iron steed through black clouds, dark mists swirling, lightning intertwining. Recite the Seventeen Divine Kings Incantation again, spray water, and thunder crashes to extinguish. Clasp both hands and recite the Thunder Formation Incantation:\n\n*\"Hēng hōng huá liàn jiù jīng shè yín-wǔ dǒu, thunder’s first peal startles the world—zǐ-wǔ dǒu. A halo ten thousand fathoms wide illuminates the heavenly demons—zǐ-hài moves in reverse. Spray water, thunder roars, lightning flashes!\"*\n\n**Fire Enclosure Incantation:**\n*\"Oṃ hūṃ hūṃ trāṇa hāṇa yán qián yí chì, decree the rise of the Nine Heavens’ Fire Department’s boundless Mighty Divine Kings! Decree the rise of the Nine Heavens’ Thunder Fire, Lightning Fire, Flying Fire, Flowing Fire, Hurled Fire, Thunderbolt Fire, Seven Stars Fire, Xie Immortal Fire, Blazing Thunder Fire, and the Three Heavens’ Fire Kings! Sternly harness the Kui Dragons, roar and ride the Flying Tigers, Lions, White Cranes, Xiezhi, Qilin, Fire Camels, Fire Elephants, Fire Eagles—ten thousand legions. Copper-headed and iron-faced, a million fire soldiers. The Five Emperors’ ritual axes, the Four Heavenly Wanderers, the Emperor’s Bell resounding—all demonic paths tremble. Cavern heavens and blessed lands, mountains and rivers, the hidden and dark, city gods and earth deities, unruly demons and spirits. Mountains collapse and trees sink; the hundred valleys boil. What spirit dares resist? Those who do not submit shall comply. Defy me, and perish; follow me, and live. Northern Numinous Black Calendar, the Nine Uglies and Purple Youths. Wind Earls and Rain Masters, driving thunder and drinking rainbows. The Vast-Mouthed Wind King, Fire Lords and Fire Maidens, Fire Dragons and Fire Horses—descend from heaven!\"*\n\nAmidst the banners of Bing and Ding, fire serpents exhale their qi, fire clouds rise on all sides, and fire dragons gallop forth. The Five Generals of the Capital Heaven roar with thunderous voices, sending sand flying and stones hurtling, uprooting trees and displacing their roots. The Wind Wheel turns to the left, the Fire Chariot follows to the right, illuminating all under heaven and transforming into a city of flame. Beneath the Dipper’s bowl, the Four Corners of the Thunder Department cast their might across the world. Amidst the raging inferno and scorching winds, ghostly spirits that dare appear plunge ten thousand fathoms into the earth, reduced to flying ash. Ancient trees and malevolent shrines are lost forever in the dust of eternal delusion.\n\n*Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the Edict of the Boundless Might of the Celestial Fire Department’s Divine King of Great Power and Virtue, the Great Marshal of Awesome Might—Wind, Fire, Thunder, and Lightning—seize and subdue!*\n\n**Slaying and Subduing Heavenly Penetrator Incantation**\nOm Hūṃ Trāḥ!

Complete the five-character incantation with a seal: first vertical, then horizontal, third inverted. To activate the seal, first mark the Eight Gates upon the earth. I am then Marshal Wu, dispatching the Five Generals to act. Carve them out, then withdraw the self beyond the Dharma Realm.\nWith long practice, the spirit roams the Eight Extremes.\nOn Metal days, dispatch Metal and Earth; on Wood days, dispatch Wood and Earth; on Earth days, dispatch Earth; on Fire days, dispatch Fire and Earth; on Water days, dispatch Water and Earth. The incantation:\n*Metal, Wood, Earth, Water, Fire; Wood, Earth, Water, Fire, Metal; Earth, Water, Fire, Metal, Wood; Water, Fire, Metal, Wood, Earth\n\nTo the local authorities and involved parties, this bureau hereby issues this summons for verification and execution as required. Let the following be decreed:\n\n**Seal**\nThis talismanic summons invokes the command of the Venerable Marshal, Lord of Loyalty and Valor from Nanyang, Supreme Commander of the Hosts, who leads the Five Thunder Lords—Generals Guan, Zhang, Ma, Huang, and Zhao—the Five Tiger Warriors—and the assembled thunder soldiers of the Nine Palaces, Eight Gates, and Eight Arrays, all sworn to loyalty and filial piety. Proceed with haste to supervise the City God and local deities, the Community Spirit and Thunder Gods, to address the matter at hand. Set a deadline for the appointed day, that retribution may be manifest. Thus is the summons decreed.\n\n**Second Summons**\n**Bureau Seal**\nIn accordance with the local circumstances and the nature of the affair, having already complied with the originally issued sealed summons and set a time limit for execution, yet finding that obstinate and perverse forces have defied the celestial decree, persisting in their transgressions without repentance, this bureau now issues this urgent commission to enforce compliance without delay.\n\nIn the primordial chaos of the Great Beginning and the Great Simplicity, there existed a formless unity. Fuxi first drew the Four Symbols, from which arose the Eight Trigrams, interacting to form the Nine Palaces. They wove the warp and weft of heaven and earth, fixed the positions of wind and thunder, and shaped the mountains and rivers. No ghost or spirit dared disturb their harmony.\n\nYet when the cycle reaches its end and the final *jia* day arrives, grievances and evil forces rise in defiance. Should any demon or malevolent spirit dare to poison the living, allowing these vile hordes to test the bounds of celestial law, let them be struck down by the thunder-axe, annihilated in an instant without pause. Thus is this summons urgently issued for enforcement.\n\n**Seal**\n\nTo the Right: Summons to the Commander-in-Chief, the Loyal and Martial Heroic Marquis of Nanyang, Supreme Marshal of the Celestial Armies—accompanied by the Thunder Vice-Generals Guan, Zhang, Ma, Huang, and Zhao, the Five Great Thunder Lords and Five Tiger Valiants—along with the Loyal and Filial Thunder Soldiers. United in purpose and strength, they shall hasten by golden steed courier to the appointed place, bestowing steadfast protection and radiant might.\n\nRiding flying clouds and coursing mists, they roar with thunderous voices, overturning heaven and earth, whipping winds and lashing lightning. Thunderfire and lightning bolts blaze forth, electric flames soar aloft, shaking the Five Peaks and churning the Four Seas. Clouds gather in ranks, mists press close, their forces surging in mighty collision.\n\nCoiling serpents and leaping dragons, tigers and armored warriors—all demonic heresies and malevolent spirits shall be seized and severed in an instant. They shall sunder the realms of humans and ghosts, sweep away wicked essences. The Dao of Heaven shall be purified, the Dao of Earth shall be pacified, the human Dao shall honor life, and the ghostly Dao shall be obliterated in form.\n\nThe Emperor’s Bell resounds, striking terror into demonic hearts. With the colossal axe of Heaven’s Executioner, they shall inspect the ghostly encampments—no concealment shall be tolerated. All spirits shall obey the vermilion-script *Tianpeng* incantation:\n\n**Hasten! Hasten!** As the Nine Heavens’ swift pursuer, Nezha, and the Heavenly Marshal Tianpeng execute the celestial decree to slay and subdue ghosts.\n\n**Triple Deadline Summons**\n*Seal of the Bureau*\n\nWhereas, in accordance with the circumstances of the locale and the nature of the matter, strict measures shall be enforced to eradicate these stubborn and pernicious evils—those who stealthily commit villainy, repeatedly perpetrate wickedness, and persist in defiance without remorse. Having violated the celestial statutes and provoked the divine punishments, their accumulated evil cannot be concealed, nor their grave crimes pardoned. Thus, Heaven decrees their extermination, annihilating their ringleaders and scattering their factions.\n\nHerein is invoked the Great Dao of the Grand Beginning and the Grand Simplicity. In the nameless era of Dragon Han, the cosmic measures were set in motion. In the Crimson Brightness and Jade Purity, the First Azure Jade Talisman was revealed, and the Celestial Sovereign issued his resplendent decree. The firmness of Qian prevails, the vigor of Zhen shakes, the radiance of Li illumines, and the rectitude of Kun endures. The great marsh of Dui gathers mighty warriors, mountains and marshes commune in qi. Kan ensures trust and prosperity, Xun exercises authority. The eight trigrams interlock, commanding the thunder’s might.\n\nAs the *Yi* states: *\"The former kings, in administering punishments, made them clear as lightning and thunder. In adjudicating cases and meting out justice, they acted with resolute decisiveness.\"* Thus shall the ghosts be butchered and dismembered, wind and fire ceasing not.\n\n**Seal of the Commanding General**\nThe Loyal and Martial Heroic Marquis of Nanyang, Commander-in-Chief of the Armies, leads the charge. Under his command are the Vice Generals of the Yin Thunder—Guan, Zhang, Ma, Huang, and Zhao—the Five Tiger Mighty Generals, along with the loyal and filial Thunder Soldiers. Their wrath is mighty, and they advance in all directions. The heavens quake, the earth trembles, their roars shake the thunder, flying spears and fluttering halberds cleave the air, fierce winds and swift lightning strike. Clouds gather, mists surge, dragons and tigers charge, eagles soar and raptors strike, shattering the ghostly encampments. Ghostly essences are obliterated, demonic forms are annihilated. The realms of humans and ghosts are sundered, dwellings purified and pacified.\n\nShould any dare resist, the statutes shall be enforced by the *Nüqing* Vermilion-Script *Nitianpeng* Incantation:\n**Hasten! Hasten!** As the Nine Heavens’ swift pursuer, Nezha, and the Heavenly Marshal Tianpeng execute the celestial decree to slay and subdue ghosts.\n\nThis is the **Five Thunder Doutian Method**, a secret legacy of the Reclining Dragon, Zhuge Wu Hou of Shu Han—valiant, upright, and direct in its efficacy. In my youth, I reverently admired the mysteries of the Dao and obtained this esoteric text. Never did I dare treat it with negligence, ever mindful of its power. Through it, I have healed the sick, expelled evil, safeguarded myself, and secured my household, its responses as swift as echo to sound. Its divine efficacy is towering and fierce, its brilliance resounding, its virtue harmonizing with Heaven and Earth, its luminosity merging with the sun and moon. It discerns the conditions of ghosts and spirits, its depths unfathomable—truly divine, yet transcending divinity, mysterious, yet beyond mystery.\n\nAll who share this aspiration, treasure and receive it, revere and practice it. How can the degenerates of the Dharma-Ending Age be mentioned in the same breath?\n\n**Here ends the Secret Five Thunder Doutian Method of the Loyal and Filial Zhuge Wu Hou.**",

      "translated_text": "Thus, he abandoned the secular world and entered Mount Wudang to follow the Dao and delve into the Heavenly Heart Orthodox Dharma, bringing fortune to the state and well-being to the people, his reputation resounding throughout the court and countryside. During the Dade era, he was enfeoffed as the Hidden Perfected One, the True Yang Perfected, and ascended in seated meditation from the Southern Peak. His disciples built a shrine to honor him, petitioning the court to bestow the name \"Ascending Perfection Abbey.\" Two years later, lightning flashed and thunder roared as the divine seal flew away.\n\nThe Fire Bell Complete Yang Perfected, Master Zhao, received the transmission after a thunderbolt split a jujube tree, carving the seal to propagate the Dharma across rivers and lakes. At Mount Yuji, he achieved transformation in stillness. The lineage passed next to the Valley Yang Perfected, Master Huang, under whom the Dharma flourished ever more brightly. During the Tianli era, it emerged at Mount Yin in Yangzhou. By the Xinma year of the Zhizheng reign, when troops rose in Qizhou and Yingzhou, he retired to the Western Mountains of Hongdu. On the Shangyuan Festival of the Jiyou year, he sat in perilous posture and transcended as an immortal.\n\nIn my youth, I had the fortune to attend his teachings. Here, I do not obscure his merit in benefiting the world without self-praise, nor his deeds in aiding people and profiting all things. Moreover, just as Marquis Wu achieved fame through the Eight Formations, his merit overshadowing the Three Kingdoms, his unity of lord and minister illuminated the annals of history—knowing advance and retreat, life and death, without losing rectitude, he delved deeply into the profound subtleties of the *Yi Jing*’s images and laws. A hundred generations hence, he is still summoned by the imperial court for his valor, integrity, and uprightness, his decrees spreading across the land, his majestic command expelling demons and monsters, his radiant spirit shining above—how awe-inspiring!

Strike the ritual drum thrice, and all spirits shall heed the command.\n\nNow, as this incense burns, I invoke the Messenger of the Current Day and Hour, the officers of the Six Ding and Six Jia, the Attendant Pure Maidens, and the Altar’s Earth Deity to bear this offering of faith. May the incense ascend, and swiftly summon the Presiding Deity, the Primordial Lady of the Nine Heavens, the True and Mysterious Weaver of the Great Loom. Urgently command the arrival of the Commander, the Fierce Thunder Deity of Execution and Supreme General; the Deputy Thunder Generals—Former General Guan Yu, Right General Zhang Fei, Left General Huang Zhong, General of the Western Expedition Ma Chao, and Tiger Might General Zhao Yun—to descend before the altar and receive orders.\n\n**Divine Transformation:**\n*\"Great Emperor of the Heavenly Sovereign,\nSwiftly transform my spirit.\"*",

      "translated_text": "To the local authorities and involved parties, this bureau hereby issues this summons for verification and execution as required. Let the following be decreed:\n\n**Seal**\nThis talismanic summons invokes the command of the Venerable Marshal, Lord of Loyalty and Valor from Nanyang, Supreme Commander of the Hosts, who leads the Five Thunder Lords—Generals Guan, Zhang, Ma, Huang, and Zhao—the Five Tiger Warriors—and the assembled thunder soldiers of the Nine Palaces, Eight Gates, and Eight Arrays, all sworn to loyalty and filial piety. Proceed with haste to supervise the City God and local deities, the Community Spirit and Thunder Gods, to address the matter at hand. Set a deadline for the appointed day, that retribution may be manifest. Thus is the summons decreed.\n\n**Second Summons**\n**Bureau Seal**\nIn accordance with the local circumstances and the nature of the affair, having already complied with the originally issued sealed summons and set a time limit for execution, yet finding that obstinate and perverse forces have defied the celestial decree, persisting in their transgressions without repentance, this bureau now issues this urgent commission to enforce compliance without delay.\n\nIn the primordial chaos of the Great Beginning and the Great Simplicity, there existed a formless unity. Fuxi first drew the Four Symbols, from which arose the Eight Trigrams, interacting to form the Nine Palaces. They wove the warp and weft of heaven and earth, fixed the positions of wind and thunder, and shaped the mountains and rivers. No ghost or spirit dared disturb their harmony.\n\nYet when the cycle reaches its end and the final *jia* day arrives, grievances and evil forces rise in defiance. Should any demon or malevolent spirit dare to poison the living, allowing these vile hordes to test the bounds of celestial law, let them be struck down by the thunder-axe, annihilated in an instant without pause. Thus is this summons urgently issued for enforcement.\n\n**Seal**",

      "translated_text": "Whereas, in accordance with the circumstances of the locale and the nature of the matter, strict measures shall be enforced to eradicate these stubborn and pernicious evils—those who stealthily commit villainy, repeatedly perpetrate wickedness, and persist in defiance without remorse. Having violated the celestial statutes and provoked the divine punishments, their accumulated evil cannot be concealed, nor their grave crimes pardoned. Thus, Heaven decrees their extermination, annihilating their ringleaders and scattering their factions.\n\nHerein is invoked the Great Dao of the Grand Beginning and the Grand Simplicity. In the nameless era of Dragon Han, the cosmic measures were set in motion. In the Crimson Brightness and Jade Purity, the First Azure Jade Talisman was revealed, and the Celestial Sovereign issued his resplendent decree. The firmness of Qian prevails, the vigor of Zhen shakes, the radiance of Li illumines, and the rectitude of Kun endures. The great marsh of Dui gathers mighty warriors, mountains and marshes commune in qi. Kan ensures trust and prosperity, Xun exercises authority. The eight trigrams interlock, commanding the thunder’s might.\n\nAs the *Yi* states: *\"The former kings, in administering punishments, made them clear as lightning and thunder. In adjudicating cases and meting out justice, they acted with resolute decisiveness.\"* Thus shall the ghosts be butchered and dismembered, wind and fire ceasing not.\n\n**Seal of the Commanding General**\nThe Loyal and Martial Heroic Marquis of Nanyang, Commander-in-Chief of the Armies, leads the charge. Under his command are the Vice Generals of the Yin Thunder—Guan, Zhang, Ma, Huang, and Zhao—the Five Tiger Mighty Generals, along with the loyal and filial Thunder Soldiers. Their wrath is mighty, and they advance in all directions. The heavens quake, the earth trembles, their roars shake the thunder, flying spears and fluttering halberds cleave the air, fierce winds and swift lightning strike. Clouds gather, mists surge, dragons and tigers charge, eagles soar and raptors strike, shattering the ghostly encampments. Ghostly essences are obliterated, demonic forms are annihilated. The realms of humans and ghosts are sundered, dwellings purified and pacified.\n\nShould any dare resist, the statutes shall be enforced by the *Nüqing* Vermilion-Script *Nitianpeng* Incantation:\n**Hasten! Hasten!** As the Nine Heavens’ swift pursuer, Nezha, and the Heavenly Marshal Tianpeng execute the celestial decree to slay and subdue ghosts.\n\nThis is the **Five Thunder Doutian Method**, a secret legacy of the Reclining Dragon, Zhuge Wu Hou of Shu Han—valiant, upright, and direct in its efficacy. In my youth, I reverently admired the mysteries of the Dao and obtained this esoteric text. Never did I dare treat it with negligence, ever mindful of its power. Through it, I have healed the sick, expelled evil, safeguarded myself, and secured my household, its responses as swift as echo to sound. Its divine efficacy is towering and fierce, its brilliance resounding, its virtue harmonizing with Heaven and Earth, its luminosity merging with the sun and moon. It discerns the conditions of ghosts and spirits, its depths unfathomable—truly divine, yet transcending divinity, mysterious, yet beyond mystery.\n\nAll who share this aspiration, treasure and receive it, revere and practice it. How can the degenerates of the Dharma-Ending Age be mentioned in the same breath?\n\n**Here ends the Secret Five Thunder Doutian Method of the Loyal and Filial Zhuge Wu Hou.**",
