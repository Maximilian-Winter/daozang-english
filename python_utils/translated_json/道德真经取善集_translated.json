  "full_translation": "**The Daoist Classic *Taking the Good from the Dao De Jing* – A Compilation**\n\n**Title:** *Taking the Good from the Dao De Jing*\n**Compiled by:** Jin Li Lin (金李霖).\n**Twelve volumes.**\nIts preface states: *\"Now I take the virtues of various schools, severing them by my own understanding of goodness,\"* hence its name, *Taking the Good from the Dao De Jing*.\nA preface by Liu You Sheng (刘尤升) precedes the volumes.\nSource of the base text: *The Zhen Tong Daoist Canon* (《正统道藏》), in the **Tongshen (洞神) Section – Jade Precepts (玉诀类)**.\n\n---\n\n**Preface to *Taking the Good from the Dao De Jing***\n\nWhen the Master Lao (老氏) was in the declining years of the Shang Dynasty, he pitied the corruption of the Way (道) and the moral decline of his age, attributing it to the excesses of culture. Thus, he sought to restore the simplicity of the ancient Dao, expounding the profound winds of mysticism to rouse the common folk—even to the point of scorn for virtue and morality, rejecting ritual and scholarship. Indeed, his words were so piercingly direct that they could not be bent by falsehood; hence, Confucius held him in reverence.\n\nUpon seeing it, Confucius sighed, *\"It is like a dragon!\"*—only the sage knows the sage, and so he spoke.\n\nGuan Yin (关尹) beheld the auspicious purple vapor and recognized the True Person (真人) crossing the pass. With devout sincerity, he knelt and pleaded for instruction, and only then did the Master descend his profound teachings.\n\nCritics often say that the Five Classics (五经) are vast yet inferior to the two chapters of this text in brevity—truly, there is reason for this.\n\nZhuang Zhou (庄周) and Lie Yu (列御寇) expanded its teachings, as if stirring great waves in the boundless sea or raising towering peaks upon lofty mountains. Yet even this only approximates its edges without fully grasping its intent. Only when one forgets words does one truly recognize its guiding principles.\n\nDuring the reigns of Emperor Wen (文) and Emperor Jing (景) of the Han Dynasty, governance favored simplicity and tranquility, and the empire flourished in peace. This was due to the guidance of Cao Can (曹参), who followed the teachings of Gao Gong (盖公), proving the efficacy of the Dao De’s virtue (德) in transforming the world—indeed, the Master’s lament was not in vain.\n\nIn the Jin Dynasty, however, the Dao degenerated into frivolous fancy. Wang Xuan (王衍) indulged in empty discourse, undermining the pure traditions. Ruan Ji (阮籍) raged recklessly, further destroying the foundations of moral order. To abandon the root and follow only the branches—how could one not grieve?\n\nFortunately, the Sui scholar Wang Zhongyan (王仲淹) deeply understood its nature, declaring that *\"the Dao’s emptiness was prolonged, and the Jin Dynasty thus declined—not the fault of Laozi and Zhuangzi, but because their teachings were misapplied.\"*\n\nIn the Tang Dynasty, Han Yu (韩愈) still mocked its minimalism as *\"petty virtue, like a frog in a well viewing the heavens.\"* Alas, Han Yu squandered his brilliance while ignorant of the Dao—he was deaf and blind in spirit, unable to perceive how the thunder of Tai Mountain (太山) could shake his ears and dazzle his sight.\n\nTo call this lack of wisdom, and to earn the sighs of the virtuous—how lamentable!\n\nDevout adherents have never been lacking across generations, each interpreting the text according to their own understanding. Their commentaries number in the tens, making it difficult both to read and to compile.\n\nLi Lin (李霖) of Rao Yang (饶阳), styled Zong Fu (宗傅), was by nature serene and unassuming, steadfast from youth to old age. He dedicated himself to studying the Five Thousand Characters (五千之文), embodying the resolve of *\"knowing the lofty and noble as worthy of emulation, forgetting the labor of probing and analyzing.\"* He gathered the finest interpretations from various schools, blending them with his own insights, and produced six volumes.\n\nJust as the Eight Tones (八音) differ yet harmonize to the ear, or the Five Flavors (五味) vary yet please the palate—so too does this work.\n\nThe purpose is to broaden understanding and enrich knowledge, thereby aiding fellow practitioners of the Way. Its contributions, though modest, are by no means insignificant.\n\nWang Bin was the Master’s old friend, and in admiration of his diligence and fulfillment of his aspirations, he commissioned artisans to engrave the text onto wooden blocks, sparing those who cherish the Way the labor of manual transcription. His thoughtful generosity can hardly be called anything but benevolent.\n\nThis was in the year *Dàdìng* *Rénchén* (大定壬辰), on the *Chóngwǔ* day (重午), prefaced by the River Interval Scholar Liu Yunsheng (河间刘允升).\n\nAll things derive from the Dao.\nThe Dao within us is virtue/power (*dé*).\nThe Dao is subtle and formless, its transformations unfathomable.\nVirtue/power is manifest and substantial—yet all is virtue/power.\nFrom its differences, it appears as two names.\nFrom its unity, its essence remains singular.\n\nThe unlearned speak of the Dao yet often overlook virtue/power.\nThose who speak of virtue/power invariably include the Dao.\nThus, the separation of Dao and virtue/power obscures their perfect unity.\n\nJust as the Dragon, the Supreme Sage, lamented the decay of nature and life at the end of the Shang dynasty, and pitied the decline of Dao and virtue/power, he composed *Nine Times Nine* chapters to illuminate the most profound mysteries. His words did not exceed the *Five Thousand Characters*, yet their meaning permeated the Three Teachings. Internally, it teaches cultivation of the heart and nurturing of life; externally, it guides governance and the pacification of the people—being the foremost principle for all speech and the origin of all things. It encompasses the vast without omission, the minute without neglect. Its language is concise, its meaning profound—vast and boundless indeed.\n\nSince the advent of written records, no text has surpassed this Scripture in its profundity. Though many have since commented upon it, few have grasped its entirety. Each interprets according to their own perspective, with inevitable gains and losses. Those who comprehend nature may attain the subtle mysteries of the Perfect Spirit, yet their understanding of life may remain incomplete. Those who master life may grasp the essential keys to longevity, yet their grasp of nature may be insufficient.\n\nYet truly, nature and life are inseparable—Dao and virtue/power are one.\n\nFrom my youth to maturity, I recited the Mysterious Words in vain, awaiting the opportunity to answer inquiries. Now aged, I seek to delve into their deeper meanings to cultivate my own authenticity. Knowing my feeble understanding cannot fathom the Sage’s intent, I have gathered the finest interpretations of others and supplemented them with my own, not to enlighten later generations, but for the convenience of reference. I have titled it *The Gathering of the Virtuous* (*Qǔshànjí*), hoping readers will not scorn it.\n\n**Prefatory Remarks to *The Gathering of the Virtuous* from the Rao Yang Recluse Li Lin**\n*Dao and Virtue/Power Classic – The Gathering of the Virtuous, Volume One*\n*Collected Works of the Song Dynasty Rao Yang Recluse Li Lin*\n\n**Imperial Annotation:**\nThe Dao is the path all share.\nVirtue/power is what the heart attains on its own.\nThe Dao endures through all ages without decay.\nVirtue/power fills the nature and remains ever-present.\n\nLaozi, in the declining years of the Zhou, saw the Dao descend while virtue/power waned, and thus composed *Nine Times Nine* chapters to clarify the eternal principles of Dao and virtue/power, calling it the *Classic*. Its words are simple, its meaning profound—students must ponder it in silence and strive deeply to master it.\n\n**Chapter One: The Dao That Can Be Spoken Of**\n\nThe Dao that can be spoken of is not the Eternal Dao.\nThe name that can be named is not the Eternal Name.\n\nYán Zhūn remarked: *\"The Dao that can be spoken of is the manifest virtue/power, not the natural and spontaneous.\"*\n\nToday’s practitioners do not carry torches by day because the sun shines naturally.\nThe natural brightness of the sun is the Eternal Dao.\nCarrying torches is the manifest Dao.\n\nWhat can be inscribed on bamboo and silk, carved into metal and stone, and passed down to others—this is the Dao that can be spoken of.\nYet there is also the Dao that can be transmitted but not received, obtained but not seen—its origin and root precede Heaven and Earth, existing since antiquity. It is the eternal Dao that gives birth to gods, spirits, Heaven, and Earth.\n\nThe profundity of the *Five Thousand Characters* is unfolded in these few words—truly, the Mysterious beyond the Mysterious, the Divine beyond the Divine.\n\nWang Yuanzé said: *\"Names arise from reality. Reality has form and measure; once form and measure are established, decay follows inevitably. How then can it be eternal? Only by grasping this impermanence can one attain true permanence.\"*\n\nThe opening phrase introduces *Dao*—the Great Dao.\nThe subsequent phrase, *\"the Dao that can be spoken of,\"* refers to the Dao of speech.\n\nThe Great Dao is empty and tranquil; its principles are profound and unfathomable. It cannot be spoken of, only grasped in silent understanding. Thus, the mind is perplexed and unable to comprehend, the tongue falters and cannot articulate—it must be intuitively realized within the spirit’s depths.\n\nEven the word *Dao* itself cannot be spoken.\nIf left unspoken, the common folk follow it without knowing.\nThus, the Sage, unable to bear silence, named it *Dao*.\nOnce named, speech and explanation arise, waxing and waning in succession—this is not the Eternal Dao.\n\nWhat can be spoken of is all the Dao, yet it is not the Eternal Dao.\nOnly what cannot be spoken of can be eternal.\n\nNow, Confucian virtues like *rén* (仁, benevolence), *yì* (义, righteousness), *lǐ* (礼, propriety), and *zhì* (智, wisdom) are the Dao that can be spoken of yet cannot be eternal.\nOnly when they cannot be spoken of—when *rén* is *rén*, *yì* is *yì*, *lǐ* is *lǐ*, and *zhì* is *zhì*—do they remain unchanging while the Dao endures. Thus, the eternal Dao that cannot be spoken of is the natural and spontaneous, responding to stimuli and transforming without end, interacting with all things exhaustively. It cannot be transmitted through words or sought through intellect—only by embodying the mysterious workings of nature, containing light and concealing radiance, doing nothing yet accomplishing all, silently attaining its utmost.\n\nThe nameless is the beginning of Heaven and Earth.\nThe named is the mother of all things.\n\nWén Gōng remarked: *\"Heaven and Earth are the greatest of forms. Their origin must derive from the nameless, hence the beginning of Heaven and Earth is called *nameless*. All things are born through form, their birth depending on the named, hence the mother of all things is called *named*.\"*\n\nLǚ Jìfǔ said: *\"The nameless is the Dao, from which Heaven and Earth originate. Thus, it is called the *nameless*, the beginning of Heaven and Earth.*\n\n*Before the beginning, there was the nameless and the unnamed.*\n*The unnamed gave rise to the named.*\n\n*Without the unnamed, even Oneness cannot be attained.*\n*The named is the origin of Oneness.*\n\n*With Oneness yet unformed, this is the beginning of Heaven and Earth.\"*\n\n---\n\nOnce it is called **Oneness**, can one still attain the **nameless**?\n\nThis thing, obtained and thus born, is called **virtue/power**. Hence, what is called the **named** is the mother of all things.\nAnd all things obtain **Oneness** to be born—this is the case.\n\nThe **nameless** is called **Dao/Way**. The **Dao/Way** is ever the **nameless**, giving rise to Heaven and Earth,\nand thus is the beginning of Heaven and Earth—this is the **Dao/Way**’s marvelous essence.\n\nThe **named** is called Heaven and Earth. Heaven envelops, Earth sustains,\nand only then do all things stand—hence it is the mother of all things,\nthis being the **Dao/Way**’s broad manifestation.\n\nHeaven and Earth possess form and position—this is the **named**.\nThe mother of all things, Heaven and Earth containing **qi**,\nnurtures and matures all things, as a mother rears her child.\n\nTo dwell in the **nameless** is to seek its marvelous essence.\nTo dwell in the **named** is to seek its broad manifestation.\n\nSū Zǐyóu remarked:\n*\"From the **nameless**, form arises as Heaven and Earth.\nWhen Heaven and Earth are positioned, the **named** begins to stand.\nFrom the **named**, dispersion gives birth to all things.\nWhen all things are nurtured, the **named** is beyond measure.\nThus, the **nameless** is the **Dao/Way**’s substance,\nwhile the **named** is the **Dao/Way**’s function.\"*\n\nThe Sage embodies the **Dao/Way** for the world’s use,\nentering all things yet ever **nameless**,\nto behold its marvelous essence.\n\nThe Sage embodies its utmost **namelessness** yet ever **named**,\nto behold its broad manifestation.\n\nIf one acts only in its broad manifestation while ignorant of its marvelous essence,\nthen it is coarse and not divine.\n\nIf one lingers only in its marvelous essence while ignorant of its broad manifestation,\nthen it is refined yet not practical.\n\nThe text states:\n*\"When moved by things, this is the stirrings of nature.*\nNature’s stirrings are the **Dao/Way**’s movement away from **stillness**,\nrelying on ears and eyes for sight and sound,\nwearing out the heart and mind through ceaseless thought and planning.\n\nWithout desire, one may dwell in **stillness** to observe the beginning of Heaven and Earth—\nthis is the marvelous essence.\nHence it is said:\n*'To ever lack desire is to call it **small**.*\nThe marvelous essence is refined yet **small**.\n\nWith desire, one moves to observe the mother of all things—\nthis is the broad manifestation.\nHence it is said:\n*'All things return to it yet none know its master—this is the **great**.*\nThe broad manifestation is expansive yet **great**.*\n\nThe person without desire may perceive the **Dao/Way**’s refined marvel.\nThe person with desire sees only its coarse broadness.\n\nThese two arise from the same source yet bear different names,\nboth called **Xuan/Mysterious**.\nWén Gōng remarked:\n*\"The **Mysterious** is neither **having** nor **non-having**,\nthe ultimate of refined subtlety.\nThe two refer to **having desire** and **lacking desire**.\nThey arise from the same source—\nboth spring from the human heart.\nYet they bear different names,\nfor their names vary.\nThough their names differ, their substance never truly does.\nSince their substance never truly differs,\nthen both **having desire** and **lacking desire** are called **Mysterious**.*\n\nThe **Mysterious** as color is black,\nyet shares the same origin as red.\nHeaven’s hue is **Mysterious**,\nfor yin and yang share the same origin.\n\nBoth are called **Mysterious**,\nfor the **Mysterious** can embrace both yin and yang.\nThe **Mysterious** beyond the **Mysterious**,\nis the gateway to all marvels.\n\nThe *Commentary* states:\n*\"The *Suwen* says: The **Mysterious** gives birth to the divine.*\n*The *Yijing* calls the marvelous yet **small** the **Mysterious**.*\nThe **Mysterious** is Heaven’s color,\nyet the colors that arise from it never reveal the **Mysterious** itself.\nThe **Mysterious** beyond the **Mysterious** is what is meant by 'colors that arise from it.'\nThe **Mysterious**’s refined principle permeates all things,\nHeaven’s movement, Earth’s resting,\nthe human spirit’s vitality, and the flourishing of all creatures—\nall are marvels,\nyet all emerge from the **Mysterious**.\nThus it is called the **gateway to all marvels**.*\n\n*The *Yijing* says:*\n*'The interplay of one yin and one yang is called the **Dao/Way**,\nand yin and yang both originate from Oneness.*\nOneness is what the **Dao/Way** gives rise to.\nThe **Mysterious** is where yin and yang share the same origin,\nand the **Mysterious** is also the **Dao/Way** itself.\nAll marvels are the marvels of all things,\nand all things possess marvelous principles,\nyet all emerge from the **Dao/Way**—\nthus it is called the **gateway to all marvels**.*\n\nThis chapter speaks of the **Dao/Way** of **True Constancy**.\nThose who awaken shall find it themselves,\nineffable and beyond naming.\nTo harmonize the observation of broadness and marvel,\none may then construct the **Dao/Way** of **True Constancy**.\n\nThe **Supreme Sovereign** begins with this chapter,\nsummarizing the entire scripture’s intent,\nilluminating the **Dao/Way**’s foundation—\nthis is the **Mysterious** beyond the **Mysterious**.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Two: \"All Under Heaven Know\"**\n\nAll under Heaven know beauty as beauty—then ugliness arises.\nAll know goodness as goodness—then non-goodness arises.\n\nThe *Commentary* states:\n*\"The **Dao/Way** has no varied appearances—who then is beauty or ugliness?\nNature is inherently unified—who then is good or not?\nThere is beauty, and ugliness is its counterpart.\nHence it is said:\n*'All under Heaven know beauty as beauty—then ugliness arises.'*\nThere is goodness, and non-goodness is its counterpart.\nHence it is said:\n*'All know goodness as goodness—then non-goodness arises.'*\n\nWhat the world esteems as beauty is the divine and strange.\nWhat it abhors is the foul and rotten.\nThe divine and strange transform into the foul and rotten,\nthe foul and rotten transform into the divine and strange—\nthen what is the distinction between beauty and ugliness?\n\nWhat was once affirmed may now be denied,\nwhat was once rejected may later be employed.\"*\n\nThen what is the distinction between virtue/power and non-virtue/non-power?\n\nThe Sage embodies the unchanging truth while always manifesting,\nand transcends wondrous application while remaining non-attached—\nbeauty, ugliness, virtue/power, non-virtue/non-power,\nall are but simplified illusions, beyond comprehension.\nWhy then should non-virtue/non-power be a burden?\n\nMaster Wang Yuanze said:\n*\"Non-virtue/non-power and non-goodness are the companions of virtue/power and goodness.\nWhen virtue/power and goodness are in play,\nnon-virtue/non-power and non-goodness are already present.\nTo await their emergence and then realize it—\nthat is but late enlightenment.\nBeauty and ugliness arise from deluded emotions,\nvirtue/power and non-virtue/non-power balance in the loss of true nature.\nThe beautiful is what human emotions cherish.\nIf one knows beauty as beauty,\nthen the mind has something it cherishes as beautiful.\nWhen the mind cherishes beauty,\nit brings affliction to itself—then ugliness arises.\nIf the River Spirit (河伯) rejoices exultantly,\nboasting that all the beauty of the world lies within him,\nhe cannot escape sighing at the vastness before him,\nalmost falling into error.\nThe virtuous is what humans desire.\nIf one knows virtue/power as virtue/power,\nthen true nature has something it desires.\nWhen true nature desires,\nit strays from the Dao/Way to cling to virtue/power—then non-virtue/non-power arises.\nIf Master Bi (伯夷) saw the name of virtue/power as desirable,\nstarving beneath Chief Yang (首阳),\nit was still a loss of true nature—almost falling into error.\nFor the Dao/Way’s beauty is the supreme beauty.\nSupreme beauty transcends beauty, serene beyond all taste.\nZhuangzi said:\n*'Faintly discerned, without limit—\nall beauties arise from it.*\nThe Dao/Way’s virtue/power is the highest virtue/power.\nHighest virtue/power forgets virtue/power,\nand all virtues/powers are complete.\nHe also said:\n*'Abandon virtue/power, and virtue/power itself is fulfilled.'*\nThis chapter unifies the Dao/Way as one,\nfearing that people will cling to beauty and virtue/power,\nand not awaken to the true and constant.\nThus it follows with this passage,\nresembling *Zhuangzi’s齐物论* [\"Discourse on Equalizing Things\"].\n\nThe interplay of presence and absence,\ndifficulty and ease,\nlength and shortness,\nheight and depth,\nsound and resonance,\nbefore and after—\nthese six pairs arise from the interplay of transformation (韦变),\nfrom myriad contemplations,\nfrom divergent paths,\nand are the means by which the world’s people\nare ensnared and cannot extricate themselves.\nAbsence generates presence without movement,\npresence returns to absence—\nhence it is said: *presence and absence intergenerate.*\nWhen presence encounters difficulty,\none knows ease in action—\nhence it is said: *difficulty and ease intercomplete.*\nLength and shortness define each other,\nas with the ruler’s measurements.\nHeight and depth incline toward one another,\nas with mountains and valleys.\nA sound ascends and its echo responds—\nhence it is said: *sound and resonance harmonize.*\nA form moves and its shadow follows—\nhence it is said: *before and after interfollow.*\nThe circulation of yin and yang,\nthe progression of the four seasons,\nthe principles of all things—\nsuddenly formed, then suddenly vanished.\nTheir difficulty is like the labor of contrivance (有为) in governing the world,\ntheir ease is like the effortlessness of non-action (无为) in aligning with oneself.\nWhat is long in nature is not to be severed,\nwhat is short in nature is not to be prolonged.\nHeaven’s own height, Earth’s own depth,\nstriking the gong of the palace (宫) and the palace resounds,\nstriking the gong of the ram’s horn (角) and the ram’s horn answers.\nSpring precedes and summer follows,\nthe long precedes and the young follow—\nthough all these paired realms dwell within the Dao/Way,\nthey are far from its essence.\nMaster Wen (温公) said:\n*'Whatever has form and trace\nmust not be equalized.\nUnequalized, it leads to contention;\ncontention, to chaos;\nchaos, to exhaustion—\nthus the Sage does not value it.'*\nTherefore, the Sage dwells in non-action (无为) in his deeds,\nand practices the teaching of non-speech (不言).\nMaster Gu (顾欢) said:\n*'The Sage follows Heaven and entrusts to things,\ncreating nothing.\nHis mind ever steadfast,\nquiet before all.\nWhen beauty and virtue/power are at rest,\nthere is no contention—\nthus he is not swayed by the six realms.\nAction brings gain and loss,\nspeech brings right and wrong—\none cannot escape burdens.\nTherefore, the Sage in his affairs\nacts through non-action and teaches through non-speech,\nso that his heart remains serene,\nnever burdened by words,\nand the world returns to its constant,\nrecovering its simplicity.\nOnly when there are no burdens,\ndoes he, though dwelling between yin and yang,\ntranscend the power of creation,\nand those six pairs—\nhow could they disturb him?*\n\nThe *Classic* says:\n*\"The teaching of non-speech,\nthe benefit of non-action—\nfew under Heaven attain to them.\"*\nAll things act without refusal—\nthe *Commentary* states:\n*\"All things move and respond,\nsensing while reacting.\nLike a mirror reflecting forms,\nfair and foul appear without hesitation.\nLike a valley echoing sounds,\nbeauty and ugliness all respond—\nnothing is refused.\nNow, though the count of things\ndoes not stop at ten thousand,\nit is called ‘all things’ to signify their multitude.\n‘Act’ means to move and respond.\nAll things move and respond,\nthe Sage lets each fulfill its nature,\nnever refusing or obstructing,\nfor my heart is empty,\nneither taking nor discarding.\nIf one harbors thoughts of taking or discarding,\nthen the myriad forms of things—\nbeauty, ugliness, and more—\nhow could one not refuse them?\"*\n\nTo give birth without possession,\nto act without reliance,\nto complete the work without claiming it—\nMaster Zuan Wei (纂微) said:\n*\"All things generate themselves,\neach standing alone in transformation,\nnot possessed by me.\nThe myriad qualities strive in their own doing,\neach aligning with its own nature,\nnot relying on my virtue/power.\nWhen deeds are completed and affairs fulfilled,\nthe Dao/Way harmonizes with things,\nthe heart wanders at Mount Gu Shou (姑射),\nnot dwelling over the ten thousand people—\nthis is the Sage’s complete virtue/power.\nAll things generate themselves,\neach reaching their utmost height and grandeur.\nAll things act of their own accord,\neach rectifying their own life and fate.\nThe Sage attributes function to things,\nnot burdening himself with the three affairs—\nhence it is said:\n*'To complete the work without claiming it—\nif there is a self, then it claims.\nClaiming, it strays.'*\nEmperor Yao (帝尧) completed his work,\nyet saw himself as deficient.\nOnly when one does not claim,\ndoes one not stray.\nMaster Su Ziyou (苏子由) said:\n*\"The Sage dwells in poverty and humble station\nyet feels no poverty or humble station’s distress,\ndwells in wealth and honor\nyet feels no wealth or honor’s burden—\nthis is called ‘not claiming.’\nIf I do not claim,\nhow could others follow to claim?*\nThis is the ultimate claiming.\"*\n\n《鸿烈》 says: When the Chu general **Zi Fa** (子发) attacked the state of **Cai** (蔡) and crossed its borders, King **Xuan of Chu** (宣王) went to the outskirts to welcome him, granting him a hundred *mu* (亩) of land and the **jue** (圭) of a noble rank. Zi Fa declined the honor, saying:\n\n*\"To govern a state and establish policies—\nthis is the virtue/power of a sovereign.\nTo issue commands and have armies united—\nthis is the prestige of a general.\nTo fight battles and conquer the enemy—\nthis is the strength of commoners.\nIf I take credit for the people’s labor\nand accept their rewards and honors,\nthis would not be the Dao/Way of benevolence and righteousness.\nTherefore, I do not accept.\"*\n\nHence it is said:\n*'To complete the work without claiming it—\nif there is a self, then it claims.\nClaiming, it strays.'*\nOnly when one does not claim,\ndoes one not stray.\n\nThis chapter seeks to embody the **Zhenchang Dao** (真常之道),\nforgetting distinctions of good and evil,\nequating virtue and vice,\nand not being swayed by the six pairs of opposites.\nOnly the Sage understands this truth.\n\nThus, in conducting affairs, he acts with **wuwei** (无为),\nin teaching, he does not speak explicitly,\nand he attributes function to things without claiming it—\nthe Dao/Way abides within me yet does not stray.\n\n**Chapter Three: Not Exalting the Virtuous**\n\n*\"Not exalting the virtuous*\nmakes the people not contend.\"\n\n**Master Wen** (温公) said:\n*\"That the virtuous cannot be neglected—\nall people know this.\nBut when its excesses become corrupt,\nit leads to constant strife over reputation.\nThus, **Laozi** (老子) corrected this,\nurging people to value substance, not name.\nThe virtuous are those\nwho stand out among the crowd.\nWhen rulers distinguish and exalt them,\nelevating them with noble ranks\nand honoring them with fine carriages and robes,\nthe people then vie for external glory,\naspire to emulation,\nand pursue fame without end—\nhow could contention cease?\"*\n\nThe Sage has never truly failed to use the virtuous.\nHe simply assigns them to their proper roles\nand entrusts them with their duties—\nonly he does not exalt them.\n\n**Zhuangzi** (庄子) said:\n*\"To exalt the virtuous\nmakes the people jostle one another.\nTo prize rare goods\nmakes the people not steal.\"*\n\n**御注** explains:\n*\"Exalting the virtuous leads to widespread knowledge,\nuntil the world is in uproar—\nConfucianism and Mohism arise.\nPrize rare goods, and the people’s desires multiply,\nuntil daylight theft becomes rampant—\nas seen in the saying, 'Midday burglary at the Lu holes.' (中穴陆)\"*\n\n**御注** further states:\n*\"The people’s desires,\nwhen unchecked, override their natural inclinations,\nleading to plunder, deception, and shamelessness—\nthere is no end to their excesses.\nWhen **Yi** (夷) sees the allure of fame,\nhe starves beneath Shouyang’s slopes.\nWhen **Zhi** (跖) sees the lure of profit,\nhe dies violently at Dongling’s heights.\nTheir passions burn like wildfire,\ntheir coldness freezes like ice—\nthus, their hearts are filled with fury, disorder, and arrogance,\nand cannot be bound to the Dao/Way.\nBut the Sage\ndoes not pursue profit,\ndoes not shun harm,\ndoes not rejoice in longevity,\ndoes not lament fate,\ndoes not glory in fame,\ndoes not despise poverty—\nthen what is there to desire?\nIf desires do not arise,\nmy heart is clear and still,\nresponding only to what is felt—\nwhen motion ceases, there is no obstruction,\nwhen action begins, there is no compulsion—\nwho could disturb it?\"*\n\nThe **junzi** (君子) desires only the virtuous.\nThe **xiaoren** (小人) is drawn to wealth.\nSince there are no traces of exalting the virtuous\nand no pursuit of rare goods,\nthere are no visible desires—\nthus, the people’s hearts remain undisturbed.\n\n**Fu Yi** (傅奕) in his *Yinyi* (音义) says:\n*\"The ancient text reads: 'makes the people’s hearts not be disturbed.' (民心不乱)\"*\n\nTherefore, the Sage’s governance\n**He Shang Gong** (河上公) says:\n*\"The Sage’s rule over a state\nis the same as his cultivation of the self.\"*\n\n—empties the heart, fills the belly,\n**Cao Daochong** (曹道冲) says:\n*\"An empty heart, white and clear,\nretains the spirit and preserves the Dao/Way.\nA filled belly,\nensures full vital essence and long life.\"*\n\n—selects nothing, empties the heart so there is no virtue to exalt,\n—contains all, fills the belly so there is no desire to covet.\n\n—weakens the will, strengthens the bones.\n**御注** explains:\n*\"A strong will leads some to pursue fame without rest,\nothers to chase wealth without satisfaction,\nothers to boast of their achievements,\nor to pride themselves on their abilities—\nthe farther they stray from the Dao/Way.\nThe Sage’s will\never humbles itself, yet others hold it high.\nEver lags behind, yet others place it first.\nKnowing its strength, he guards its weakness;\nknowing its glory, he guards its shame—\nthis is called 'weakening the will.'\nAs for 'strengthening the bones,'\nif one does not harm them,\nas seen in **Guangchengzi** (广成子) living a thousand two hundred years\nwithout ever showing signs of decay—\nthis is called 'strengthening the bones.'\"*\n\n**Liu Zhongping** (刘仲平) says:\n*\"An empty heart and weakened will\nnourish the spirit.\nA filled belly and strong bones\npreserve vital essence.\nThe will is where the heart directs—\nguarding the Dao/Way weakens the will.\nThe bones are the repository of marrow—\nwhen marrow is full, the bones are strong.\nAnother interpretation:\nAn empty heart leads to a weakened will,\na filled belly leads to strong bones.\nOr:\nAn empty heart leads to a weakened will,\na filled belly leads to strong bones—\nthese are both plausible readings.\"*\n\nThe Sage’s governance\nalways makes the people **without knowledge and without desire**.\n\n**御注** explains:\n*\"Zhuangzi said:\n*'In harmony with the unknowing,\nits virtue/power does not depart.\nIn harmony with the undesiring,\nthis is called \"primordial simplicity.\" (素朴)\nPrimordial simplicity—\nand the people’s nature is preserved.'*\nThe Sage’s governance\nstrives only to let the people realize their nature.\nExcessive knowledge disrupts their natural roles,\nexcessive desire drowns their natural inclinations—\nthough it may be called 'governance,'\nwhat chaos could be greater?\"*\n\nThus, the Sage’s governance\nalways makes the people **without knowledge and without desire**.\n\n**Wang Yuanzai** (王元泽) says:\n*\"Knowledge leads to false perceptions,\ndesire leads to external seeking—\nwhen these two are removed,\nnature and emotion are settled.\nFrom not exalting the virtuous,\nhe empties the heart and weakens the will to transform them,\nmaking the people lack contentious knowledge of the virtuous.\nFrom not prizing rare goods,\nhe fills the belly and strengthens the bones to transform them,\nmaking the people lack acquisitive desire for wealth.\"*\n\n「Thus, the Sage’s governance ensures that the wise dare not act.\n**Lǚ Jìfǔ** (吕吉甫) says:\n*\"The wise know that the virtuous are not prized by the Sage,\nand that wealth is not valued by the Sage,\nyet to act upon such knowledge is not beneficial—\nhence, they dare not act.\"*\n\n**To act without acting** (為無為),\nthen there is nothing left untamed.\n**Shū Wáng** (舒王) says:\n*\"To act without purpose is to act without restraint;\nto act without restraint is to act without ceasing.\nThe Sage acts without acting,\nand thus there is nothing left untamed.\"*\n\nThis chapter speaks of the Sage embodying the **Dao/Way** of **wuwei** (無為) to govern.\n**Not prizing the virtuous, not valuing wealth,**\nemptying the heart and filling the belly,\nweakening the will and strengthening the bones—\nthis is the Sage embodying the **Dao/Way** to govern the body **without acting**.\n\n**To make the people not contend** and align with **wu zhi** (無知),\n**to make the people not steal** and align with **wu yu** (無欲),\nthen there is nothing left untamed.\n\nThe *Classic* (《經》) says:\n**\"The Dao/Way is ever without acting yet nothing remains unacted upon.**\nIf lords and kings could guard it,\nall things would naturally transform themselves.\nThe Sage who governs **without acting** is how **Yú Shùn** (虞舜) became Emperor.\nThe Sage who governs with **垂拱** (垂拱) is how **Zhōu Wǔ** (周武) became King.\nThus it is said:\n**Emperors and Kings govern without acting, and the realm is perfected.**\n\n**Chapter Four: The Dao/Way is Boundless** (道沖)\nThe Dao/Way is boundless,\nyet its use may appear as though it were not full.\n\n**御注** (Commentary):\n*\"The Dao/Way has sentiment and trust,\nhence it has use.\nWithout acting and without form,\nhence it is not full.\nBoundless (沖) means central (中).*\nThe Dao/Way’s use,\nthough it suppresses the high and elevates the low,\nreduces excess and supplements deficiency,\nhas no fixed course yet finds its center.\nThe Dao/Way’s essence,\nempty yet not full,\noverflowing yet without limit,\nnourishes all things yet never possesses—\nhence it is said to appear as though it were not full.\n\n**Abyssal (渊)**, it seems like the origin of all things.\n**Wēn Gōng** (温公) says:\n*\"Deep and unfathomable,\never the master of all things.\nAbyssal (渊) and flowing (反流) are one.*\nThe *Shuō Wén* (《说文》) says:\n*\"Returning water (回水).*\nWhen water returns, it is deep and still;\nwhen it returns and becomes an abyss (渊),\nit ceases to flow—\nthus, its unity is complete.\"\n\n**兮** (Ah) is a rhythmic aid in singing.\n**Zhuāngzǐ** (庄子) says:\n*\"The stillness of water is its abyss (渊).*\nThe abyss is deep and still,\nunmixed with things—\nthe essence of the Dao/Way.\nOnly its depth—\nno thing can fathom it.\nOnly its stillness—\nno thing can move it.\nThe Dao/Way’s essence is abyssal (渊), deep and still,\nappearing as the origin of all things.\nYet the Dao/Way itself has no inherent connection to things;\nit is the origin of itself alone—\nhence it is said to appear so.*\n\nAs for those who say \"appears\" (似),\nit is because they dare not speak directly of it.\n\n**Humans are originally sufficient within this Dao/Way;**\nthose who seek to embody it\nmust not seek it elsewhere.\nThey should blunt their sharpness,\nresolve their entanglements,\nharmonize their brilliance,\nand align with the dust—\nthen they will naturally preserve themselves.\n\n**Blunt their sharpness, resolve their entanglements,**\nharmonize their brilliance,\nand align with the dust.\n**Wēn Gōng** (温公) says:\n*\"The sharpness of edges and the fierceness of exposure—\nthese are what the Dao/Way abhors.\nTroublesome and chaotic affairs—\nthese are what the Dao/Way despises.\nDazzling radiance and ostentatious display—\nthese are the Dao/Way’s ruin.\nHumility and obscurity—\nthese are what the Dao/Way values.*\n\nWhen the heart strays outward and mingles with things,\nthat is sharpness—\nblunt it and do not act.\nWhen things arrive and the heart becomes entangled,\nthat is entanglement—\nresolve it and do not be disordered.\nTo blunt sharpness and resolve entanglements,\nthe nature and emotions settle,\nand naturally become full and radiant.\n\nOnce radiance is present,\nit is not fundamentally different from things—\nharmonized and aligned yet not displayed,\nthis is called **light yet not blinding** (光而不耀).\nWithin, it does not lose its truth;\nwithout, it does not differ from the common—\naligned with the dust yet unstained,\nthis is called **committing with things and aligning with their waves** (與物委蛇，而同其波).\n\n**Serene (湛)**, it seems as though it might be preserved.\n**Guō Xiàng** (郭象) says:\n*\"Preserved (存) means 'to exist.'\nThe Dao/Way is serene and tranquil,\nunchanging from ancient to present,\nconstant from beginning to end—\nhence it is said to exist.\nYet it exists without things—\nhence it is said to appear so.*\n\nIf humans can follow these four principles,\nthen they will be serene and ever still—\npreserved.\nTo preserve yet be fixed is not the Dao/Way.\nThe saying \"appears as though it might be preserved\" (似或者不可定有之謂)\nrefers to this.\n\nI do not know whose child it is.\n**Wáng Yuànzǎi** (王元泽) says:\n*\"It is the embodiment of the Dao/Way as spoken of today.\nThough it has an origin, it is vast and without form—\nhence it is said: I do not know whose child it is.*\nThe phrase \"whose child\" (誰之子)\nasks from whom this Dao/Way originates.\n\n**The Form of the Emperor precedes the Dao/Way.**\n**御注** (Commentary):\n*\"Form (象) is the initial appearance of things.\nThe Emperor (帝) is the manifestation of the divine responding to things.*\nThings arise and then form appears;\nthe Emperor emerges and then wondrous things are manifest.\nThe Form of the Emperor (象帝),\nthough it marks the beginning of things,\nis preceded by the Dao/Way itself.\nThis is what **Zhuāngzǐ** (庄子) meant by\n**'the divine and the ghostly, the divine and the Emperor,**\n**generating heaven and earth.'**\nThe Form of the Emperor (象帝) portends the beginning of things,\nand the Emperor (帝) is the sovereign of all things.\nThe Form of the Emperor (象帝) is most profound,\nyet the Dao/Way surpasses it even further.\nThis chapter speaks of the Dao/Way using centrality (中) as its function,\nits essence empty yet not full,\nthe master of all existence,\npreceding the Form of the Emperor (象帝).\n\n**Chapter Five: Heaven and Earth**\nHeaven and Earth are not **virtuous** (仁),\ntreating all things as **straw dogs** (刍狗).\nThe Sage is not **virtuous** (仁),\ntreating the people as **straw dogs** (刍狗).\n\n**御注** (Commentary):\n*\"Kindness arises from harm,\nharm arises from kindness.\nIf kindness is taken as kindness,\nharm will inevitably follow.\nHeaven and Earth toward all things,\nthe Sage toward the people,\naid their natural tendencies,\nwithout a heart of love or benefit.\nKindness cannot be named with certainty.\"*\n\n**Straw dogs** (刍狗) are made by bundling straw,\nused in sacrifices to **Qí** (杞).\nWhen the ritual is appropriate, they are used;\nwhen it is over, they are discarded.\nAs for the spontaneous generation of all things,\nthe self-governance of the people—\nhow could they be contained by the heart?»\n\n「爱人利物之谓仁。不仁者，谓无情於弁爱，非薄恶之谓也。\n*The Way of loving people and benefiting all things is called **virtue** (仁).\nThe unvirtuous (不仁) is said to lack emotional attachment in aiding others—\nnot the meaning of being indifferent or cruel.*\n\n天地生化万物，任其自然，无爱利之心焉。如刍狗当祭祀之用也。\nHeaven and Earth give birth and transform all things,\nletting them follow their natural course,\nwithout a heart of love or benefit.\nLike **straw dogs** (刍狗) used in ritual sacrifices.\n\n盛以箧衍，巾以文绣，尸祝斋戒，然后用之。及祭之后，行者践其首脊，樵者焚其支体，\nThey are adorned with embroidered cases and silken cloth,\nand the officiating priest, after fasting and purification,\nthen employs them.\nAfter the sacrifice, travelers trample their heads and backs,\nwoodcutters burn their limbs—\nthe things are discarded not out of hatred or affection,\nbut simply because their use has passed.\n\n且天地之於万物，圣人之於百姓，亦然。\nMoreover, Heaven and Earth’s relation to all things,\nand the Sage’s relation to the people,\nis the same.\n\n故天地无恩而大恩生，圣人不仁而大仁成。\nThus, Heaven and Earth, though without **virtue** (恩),\ngive rise to great **virtue** (恩).\nThe Sage, though not **virtue** (仁),\naccomplishes great **virtue** (仁).\n\n天地之间其犹弃钥乎。\nBetween Heaven and Earth, it is like the blowing of a **bellows** (橐) or the playing of a **flute** (钥).\n\n唐明皇曰：橐者，韛也。钥者，笛也。\nEmperor Xuanzong of the Tang said:\n*\"The **bellows** (橐) is the **pouch** (韛).\nThe **flute** (钥) is the **pipe** (笛).*\n\n橐之鼓风，钥之运吹，皆以虚而无心，故能动而有应。\nThe bellows’ wind-stirring, the flute’s breath-playing,\nboth rely on emptiness and lack a heart—\nthus they move and have response.\n\n王元泽曰：橐钥虚以应物，物感则应，应而不藏。\nWang Yuanze said:\n*\"The bellows and flute are empty yet responsive to things;\nwhen things are moved, they respond—\nbut they do not store the response.\"*\n\n天地之於万物，圣人之於百姓，应其适然，而不系累於当时，不留情於既往，\nHeaven and Earth respond to all things in their due measure,\nwithout entangling themselves in the present moment,\nwithout lingering emotionally in the past—\n\n故比橐钥之无穷也。\nthus likened to the boundless **bellows** (橐) and **flute** (钥).\n\n道无方体，以冲和之气鼓动於覆载之问，而生养万物。\nThe Dao/Way has no fixed form—\nwith its **unbounded and harmonious qi** (冲和之气),\nit stirs between the heavens and the earth,\ngiving birth and nurturing all things.\n\n如橐以气化形，钥以气出声，\nLike the bellows transforming qi into form,\nor the flute letting qi issue forth as sound—\nqi is empty yet awaits things,\nand all that has form and sound\narises from this.\nThus likened to the **bellows** (橐) and **flute** (钥).\n\n以喻天地圣人，亦以虚而无心故也。\nThis is to illustrate Heaven, Earth, and the Sage—\nall because of their emptiness and lack of a fixed heart.\n\n虚而不屈，动而愈出。\nEmpty yet never rigid,\nmoving yet ever more issuing forth.\n\n王弼曰：橐钥之中空洞，无情无为，故虚而不能穷屈，动而不可竭尽也。\nWang Bi said:\n*\"The bellows and flute are hollow within,\nwithout emotions or actions,\nthus empty yet never exhausted—\nmoving yet never spent.\"*\n\n王元泽曰：虚其体也，动其用也。多言数穷，不如守中。\nWang Yuanze said:\n*\"Empty in essence, active in function.\nExcessive speech leads to depletion—\nbetter to hold to the center.\"*\n\n御注：慎汝内，闭汝外，收视反听，复以见天地之心，此之谓守中。\n**Commentary**:\n*\"Be cautious within, close off without,\nretract your gaze and reverse your hearing—\nthus you may perceive the heart of Heaven and Earth.\nThis is called holding to the center.\"*\n\n王弼曰：若不法天地之虚静，同橐钥之无心，动不从感，言不会机，\nWang Bi said:\n*\"If you do not follow Heaven and Earth’s **emptiness and tranquility** (虚静),\nor align with the **bellows** (橐) and **flute** (钥)’s lack of a heart,\nyour movements do not arise from response,\nyour words do not accord with the Dao—\n\n动与事乖，故曰数穷。\nmoving and affairs are mismatched—\nthus it is said that depletion comes from excessive speech.\n\n不如内怀道德，抱一不移，故曰守中。\nBetter to inwardly cherish **Dao/Way and virtue** (道德),\nembracing the One without deviation—\nthus it is called holding to the center.\"*\n\n此章戒人多言，不如守内。\nThis passage warns against excessive speech—\nbetter to hold within.\n\n始言天地不仁，中以橐钥为况，终之以多言数穷者，\nIt begins by saying Heaven and Earth are not **virtue** (仁),\nuses the **bellows** (橐) and **flute** (钥) as analogy in the middle,\nand concludes with the warning that excessive speech leads to depletion—\n\n欲人之出言，法天地之无心，如橐钥之虚中，\nwishing that when people speak,\nthey follow Heaven and Earth’s lack of a fixed heart,\nlike the **bellows** (橐) and **flute** (钥)’s empty center—\n\n因感而应，则无多言之失。\nresponding naturally to stimuli,\nthen there will be no fault of excessive speech.\n\n与其言多而政祸，不如默默而守中。\nBetter to speak little and avoid misgovernance\nthan to speak much and invite calamity.\n\n谷神章第六\n谷神不死，\n\n**Chapter Six: The Valley Spirit (谷神)**\nThe Valley Spirit does not die.\n\n御注：有形则有盛衰，有数则有成败，形数具而生死分，物之理也。\n**Commentary**:\n*\"Where there is form, there is flourishing and decline.\nWhere there is number, there is success and failure.\nWhen form and number are complete, life and death are distinguished—\nthis is the nature of things.\"*\n\n谷应群动而常虚，神妙万物而常寂，\nThe Valley responds to all movements yet remains ever empty,\nthe Spirit subtly transforms all things yet remains ever still—\n\n真常之中，与道为一，不丽於形，不堕於数，\nWithin the **true and enduring** (真常),\nit aligns with the Dao/Way as One,\nnot clinging to form,\nnot entangled in number—\n\n生生而不穷。\nendlessly giving birth.\n\n如日月焉，终古不息。如维斗焉，终古不忒。\nLike the sun and moon,\nthey never cease through all ages.\nLike the **Pole Star** (维斗),\nthey never deviate through all ages.\n\n故云不死。\nThus it is said that the Valley Spirit does not die.\n\n河上公曰：谷，养也。人能养神则不死。\nRiver Master Hu said:\n*\"The Valley (谷) is nurturing.\nIf a person can nurture the Spirit (神), then they do not die.\"*\n\n神谓五脏之神，肝藏魂，肺藏魄，心藏神，肾藏精，脾藏志。\nThe Spirit (神) refers to the **vital essences of the Five Zang Organs** (五脏之神):\nthe liver stores the **hun** (魂),\nthe lungs store the **po** (魄),\nthe heart stores the **shen** (神),\nthe kidneys store the **jing** (精),\nthe spleen stores the **zhi** (志).\n\n五脏尽伤，五神去矣。\nWhen the Five Zang Organs are all injured,\nthe Five Spirits depart.\n\n温公曰：中虚故曰谷。不测故曰神。\nDuke Wen said:\n*\"Empty within, hence it is called the Valley (谷).\nUnfathomable, hence it is called the Spirit (神).*\n\n天地有穷而道无穷，故曰不死。\nHeaven and Earth have limits,\nbut the Dao/Way is boundless—\nthus it is said that the Valley Spirit does not die.\"*\n\n王元泽曰：谷应而不穷，神化而不测，\nWang Yuanze said:\n*\"The Valley responds yet never exhausts,\nthe Spirit transforms yet remains unfathomable—\nall things receive their mandate from it,\nyet it has never been born or died.\nThis is the Valley Spirit.*\n\n言神则极矣，而加谷者，\nTo speak of the Spirit is already to reach the utmost—\nyet the Valley is added—\n\n且言能虚能盈，而又能容以应也。\nbecause it also speaks of the ability to be empty and full,\nand to contain and respond.\n\n以其活而不敌，故但称不死。\nSince it is alive yet never opposed,\nit is simply called the Way of not dying.\n\n是谓玄牝。\nThis is called the **Dark Mother** (玄牝).\"\n\n御注：万物受命於无，而成形於有谷之用。\n**Commentary**:\n*\"All things receive their mandate from the **None** (无),\nand take form through the **Valley’s** (谷) nurturing function.*\n\n无相，神之体；无方，万物所受命也。\nThe

**Mother** (牝) is the category of Earth.\n\n万物所成形也，\nAll things take form from this—\n\n谷神以况至道之常，玄牝以明造物之妙。\nthe Valley Spirit illustrates the Dao’s enduring nature,\nwhile the Dark Mother reveals the

(天地根).\n\n天地者，万物之上下也。物与天地，本无先后，\nHeaven and Earth are the **up** and **down** of all things.\nThings and Heaven and Earth originally have no precedence—\n\n明大道之序，则有天地，然后有万物。\nbut when the Dao’s order

this,\nwhile the Sage **long endures** (长存) through this—\nboth **fulfill their selfishness** (成其私).\nYet **not selfishness for selfishness is great** (不私之为私大矣).*\nZhuāngzi said:\n*'No selfishness,\nyet it is **selfishness** (乃私也).'*\nThis passage states:\n*'The Dao **makes it universal** (为之公).\nHeaven and Earth embody the Dao,\nso they have no selfishness—\nno selfishness, hence **long duration** (长久).\nThe Sage embodies the Dao,\nso they have no selfishness—\nno selfishness, hence **constant endurance** (长存).\nTo **self-cultivate is selfishness** (自营为私),\nyet none have succeeded in fulfilling their selfishness.\nScholars who embody the Dao’s **universality** (体道之公),\nnot selfish toward **one’s own self** (不私一己),\nalso attain **long duration** (得其长久).\"*\n\n**The True Scripture of the Dao and Its Power: Compilation of the Good, Volume Two** (道德真经取善集卷之二)\n\n**The True Scripture of the Dao and Its Power: Compilation of the Good, Volume Two**\n**Chapter Eight: The Supreme Good Is Like Water**\n\n**Master Li Lin of Song’s Residence in Rao Yang** collected:\n\nThe supreme good is like water.\nMaster Su Shi said:\n*\"Heaven first generates water—\nthe Dao’s movement manifests as the good,\njust as qi moves to generate water.\nThus it is said: the supreme good is like water.\"*\n\nWater embodies three virtues close to the Dao,\nand seven benefits for all things.\nThe person of supreme good is like this—\nthe Dao’s true good,\nnot what all under Heaven recognize as good.\n\nThe good is the Dao’s continuation;\nwater leads the Five Phases,\nyet remains close to the Dao—\nfor when one departs from the Dao, the name \"good\" is established.\n\nThe supreme good is like water—\nthis is the natural principle of things.\nWater benefits all things yet does not contend,\ndwelling where others abhor,\nthus approaching the Dao.\n\n**Zhuǎn Wēi says:**\nThis is the three virtues close to the Dao.\n\nWater’s nature is nourishing,\nbenefiting all things—\nthis is the first virtue.\nIt takes any shape, filling vessels,\nflooding or draining as needed—\nthis is the second virtue.\nOthers abhor lowliness,\nyet water flows downward—\nthis is the third virtue.\n\nWhen water benefits things, its virtue is vast and kind;\nwhen it does not contend, its power is humble and bright;\nwhen it dwells in what others abhor, its capacity endures filth.\nThe three virtues of water—\nonly the Perfect One embodies them as one.\nSuch virtue and conduct, so close to the Dao,\nthus it is said: *near.*\n\n**Residing in the good place,**\nMaster Ma Jùjì said:\nThe good resides in humility,\nwater flows downward—\nin the good, one finds water’s place.\nThus it is said: *residing in the good place.*\nWhere water resides, the good is the land’s benefit.\nWhere the good person resides, transformation extends to the neighborhood.\n\n**The good heart is deep,**\n**御 Commentary:**\nThe deeper one probes, the deeper it becomes;\nthe farther one seeks, the more distant it grows.\nMaster Ma Jùjì said:\nThe good rests in tranquility,\nwater in depth and stillness—\nin the good, one finds water’s depth.\nThus it is said: *the good heart is deep.*\nMaster Cáo Dàochōng said:\nDepth is where water rests.\nThough winds and waves arise,\nnone can disturb its stillness.\nThe Perfect One’s heart is likewise.\n\nMaster Wáng Yuānzé said:\nDeep and still, yet level—\ninner clarity, outer obscurity.\nWith a heart deep and still, the flow returns to unity.\n\n**Giving is kind,**\n**御 Commentary:**\nCompassionate love without selfishness,\ngiving without discrimination.\nMaster Su Shi said:\nBenefiting all things,\ngiving without seeking—\nthis is kind giving.\nMaster Ma Jùjì said:\nThe good aids others—this is giving;\nwater benefits all—this is kindness.\nIn the good, one finds water’s kindness.\nThus it is said: *giving is kind.*\n\nWhere water flows,\nnothing fails to nourish and benefit all things,\nbringing them to completion.\nThe person of supreme good,\nlike water’s giving,\nbroadly benefits the people,\nextends kindness to all beings,\naids all sentient life,\nand seeks no return.\nThus it is said: *giving is kind.*\n\n**Words are trustworthy,**\n**御 Commentary:**\nAvoiding obstacles yet reaching the seas,\ntraversing dangers without losing sincerity.\nMaster Lù Tìng said:\nTreading a thousand dangers without losing sincerity,\nencountering ten thousand reversals yet never losing direction—\nthis is called *words are trustworthy.*\n\n**Governance is skillful,**\n**御 Commentary:**\nIt purifies the impure,\nsmooths the treacherous,\nfollows the natural order of things,\nand harbors no scheming heart.\nThus all is governed.\nEmperor Xuánzōng of Tang said:\nSkillful governance is like water’s cleansing—\nmaking things pure and clear.\nMaster Wáng Bì said:\nThe good in governance is without filth or bias,\nlike water’s governance—\nmost pure, most level.\nMaster Liú Zhòngpíng said:\nYet water itself has no speech of governance,\nso why say: *words are trustworthy, governance is skillful?*\nBecause this passage discusses the good person as water,\nthus extending to *words* and *governance* as well.\n\n**Actions are capable,**\n**御 Commentary:**\nFollowing the land’s contours to form curves and straightness,\nadapting to vessels to become round or square,\nchanging with circumstances yet ever level—\nnone but the capable could do this.\nMaster Su Shi said:\nEncountering things and taking their form without clinging—\nthis is capability.\nWater’s actions change without constancy,\nadapting to where it flows,\nround or square as the vessel demands,\nnever opposing things—\nthus nothing is beyond its capability.\nThe Perfect One is likewise,\nfollowing people and things,\nconforming to the world without resistance.\nThus it is said: *actions are capable.*\n\n**Movement is timely,**\n**御 Commentary:**\nThe sun releases it, and it flows;\nthe cold congeals it, and it freezes.\nIf directed east, it flows east;\nif directed west, it flows west—\nmoving without constraint,\nproper only to follow the times.\n**Zhuǎn Wēi says:**\nThe Perfect One’s dwelling is in humility,\nnaturally transforming,\nextending to the neighborhood—\nlike water on the land,\ndwelling in lowliness,\nnourishing all things.\nThus it is said: *residing in the good place*—this is the first good.\n\nThe Perfect One’s heart preserves stillness,\npenetrates the subtle,\ndeep and clear—\nlike water’s depth, serene,\nits currents shifting ninefold,\nnever losing clarity.\nThus it is said: *the good heart is deep*—this is the second good.\n\nThe Perfect One’s giving is kind,\nextending mercy to all under Heaven,\nwithout favoritism—\nlike water’s nourishment,\nrising and falling without exclusion,\nbenefiting all it touches.\nThus it is said: *giving is kind*—this is the third good.\n\nThe Perfect One’s words are trustworthy,\nguarding sincerity without expectation,\nnaturally harmonizing—\nlike water’s reflection,\nbeautiful or ugly without distinction,\nfilling and flowing without loss,\ntraversing dangers without failure.\nThus it is said: *words are trustworthy*—this is the fourth good.\n\nThe Perfect One’s governance is skillful,\nbringing order to the people,\nupright and perceptive—\nthings naturally comply.\nLike water’s purity and levelness,\nsettling high and low,\ncleansing all things,\nleaving no filth.\nThus it is said: *governance is skillful*—this is the fifth good.\n\nThe Perfect One’s actions are capable,\nadapting to things,\nassigning roles as needed,\nnever failing.\nLike water’s yielding nature,\naccommodating round or square,\nforming to the vessel—\nnothing it attempts fails.\nThus it is said: *actions are capable*—this is the sixth good.\n\nThe Perfect One’s motion and stillness,\nskilled in observing the times,\nemerging and withdrawing in response to opportunity,\nable to preserve the Dao—\nlike water’s movement,\nskilled in adapting to change,\ncongealing in winter, melting in summer,\nnever deviating from its course.\nThus it is said: *motion, skilled in timing*—this is the seventh good.\n\nTo act with foresight and move at the right time,\nto move only when the moment is ripe—\nthis is like water’s spring thaw and winter freeze.\n\nOnly the non-contending\nthus has no blame.\nSu Ziyou said:\nOne who does good yet cannot escape human censure\ndoes so because of contention.\nWater, by not contending,\npossesses all seven goods without blame.\n\nThis chapter speaks of water’s nature—\nbenefiting all things,\ngentle and weak, yet not contending,\never dwelling in lowliness—\nthus encompassing the three abilities and the seven goods without blame.\nWho, if not the Perfect One, could emulate this?\n\n**Chapter Nine: Holding and Filling**\nTo hold and fill,\nis not as good as stopping early.\nLu Jifu said:\nTo forcefully hold and fill\ndoes not necessarily make one rich.\nHolding is meant to prevent overflow,\nyet filling leads only to greater overflow.\nIf one wishes to avoid overflow,\none should avoid filling entirely.\n*Holding* means to grasp and retain;\n*filling* means to overflow;\n*stopping* means to cease.\nTo grasp and retain while also filling\ninevitably leads to collapse—\nthus, it is better to stop early.\n\nTo probe and sharpen,\ncannot be long preserved.\nWen Gong said:\nTo probe and understand others’ intentions,\nthen aggressively pursue them,\nis bound to fail.\nLu Jifu said:\nTo measure and then act is to seek what is precious.\nProbing is meant to avoid loss,\nyet sharpening leads only to greater loss.\nIf one wishes to avoid loss,\none should avoid sharpening entirely.\n*Probing* is skillful in measuring intentions;\n*sharpening* is sharp in seizing opportunities.\nProbing and sharpening,\npursuing honor and fame—\nthough one may gain them,\none is certain to lose them,\nthus they cannot be long preserved.\n\nGold and jade filling the hall,\nnone can guard them.\nShu Wang said:\n*A hall* is empty and receives things—\nwhen filled with gold and jade,\nit is overflowing.\nThus it cannot be guarded.\nMa Jiuji said:\nA hall’s depths are meant to store gold and jade,\nyet its harm lies in being filled.\nIf not by heavenly calamity,\nthen by human disaster.\nThis shows that overflow is difficult to long preserve.\n\nTo be full yet not overflow,\nis how one long guards wealth.\nTo hold and fill,\nthen gold and jade fill the hall,\nnone can guard them.\n\nRiches and nobility bring arrogance,\ninviting one’s own ruin.\n*Commentary*:\nGold, jade, riches, and nobility\nare not the essence of life.\nThey are external things one cannot rely upon.\nTo treasure gold and jade\nis to be burdened by things.\nCan one burdened by things avoid loss?\nThus none can guard them.\nRiches and nobility bring arrogance,\nharming one’s virtue.\nCan one who harms virtue escape misfortune?\nThus one invites ruin upon oneself.\n\nThe Sage does not cling to worldly gain\nas personal possession,\nnor does He rule the world\nfor His own display.\nWhat need has He for gold and jade as treasures,\nor riches and nobility as burdens?\nThus the most wealthy nation’s treasures are shared,\nthe most noble nation’s honors are shared—\nits nobility is unmatched,\nits wealth unparalleled,\nyet the Dao remains unchanged.\nHe Shang Gong said:\nWealth should relieve poverty,\nnobility should pity the lowly—\nyet if one instead grows arrogant,\ncalamity will follow.\nShu Wang said:\nRiches and nobility do not invite arrogance,\nyet arrogance comes naturally—\nthus one invites ruin and misfortune.\nThis shows that sharpening cannot be probed.\n\nTo be high yet not perilous,\nis how one long guards nobility.\nTo probe and sharpen,\nthen riches and nobility breed arrogance,\nbringing ruin upon oneself.\n\nWhen achievement is complete and fame is fulfilled,\nwithdrawal is the Way of Heaven.\nSu Ziyou said:\nThe sun moves at noon,\nthe moon wanes when full—\nthe cycles of the four seasons,\nthose who achieve must depart.\nHeaven and Earth do so—\nhow much more so for humanity.\n*Achievement* is the benefit to others;\n*fame* is the reputation applied to oneself.\nWhen achievement benefits others and is fulfilled,\nwhen fame is applied to oneself and is complete,\nto withdraw and avoid position,\nto forever avoid calamity—\nthis is the constant Way of Heaven.\nThis chapter warns:\nWealth should not be filled to overflowing,\nnobility should not be indulged.\nTo hold and fill is not as good as stopping early;\nto probe and sharpen only leads to defeat.\nGold and jade, when filled, are hard to guard;\nriches and nobility, when indulged, invite ruin;\nachievement complete, yet not held—\nfame fulfilled, yet not clung to—\nto know that loss is gain,\nis to align with the Way of Heaven.\n\n**Chapter Ten: Nurturing Vital Essence and Spirit**\n*Nurturing vital essence and spirit*—\nWang Yuanzhe said:\n*The spirit* is the essence of yin’s form.\nThe nature of spirit is vast and unbound,\nyet it does not realize itself—\nspirit always depends on vital essence,\nthus the vast becomes constrained,\nthe unbound becomes obstructed.\nThose who seek this Way\nmust first expand their will and qi,\nnot burdening themselves with form,\nso that spirit rides vital essence\nwithout being ridden by it—\nthen one may embrace unity and embody the spirit.\n\nMa Jiuji said:\nOf a person’s life,\nthe yang aspects form the *hun* (spirit-soul),\nthe yin aspects form the *po* (vital essence-corpsesoul),\nstored between the liver and lungs.\nPrecision and spirit interdependently generate life,\nwhile vital essence governs their inflow and outflow.\nThe *po* follows spirit in its movements,\nthe *hun* follows precision in its transformations.\nThis passage speaks of *nurturing vital essence*—\n*vital essence* is the same as *hun*.\n*The Inner Observation Classic* says:\nMovement that nurtures the body is called *hun*.\nThe *hun* governs all bodily functions,\ndriving the body’s operations—\nas *hun*, it governs the inflow and outflow of precision,\nmastering transformation and change.\nNow, the hundred bones and nine orifices,\nall that composes our form,\nare the domain of vital essence.\nWithout the *hun* to nurture them,\nhow would they differ from a walking corpse?\nVital essence cannot exist without *hun*,\njust as the moon cannot exist without the sun.\nVital essence depends on *hun* to function,\nthe moon depends on the sun to shine—\nthis is why *hun* is called *nurturing*,\nand vital essence is called *vital essence*.\n*Nurturing* means to embody in form.\nPast interpretations all say *nurturing* is *hun*,\nyet Wang Yuanzhe’s commentary uniquely defines *nurturing* as *po*.\n\nOne interpretation says *zài* means the form carries *hun* and *po*.\nAnother says the spirit carries *po*.\nHow can one embrace unity without separation?\n\nKing Shū of Chu replied: *\"One\"* refers to *jīng* (vital essence).\nWhen *hun* and *po* are complete, *jīng* arises;\nwhen *jīng* arises, the spirit follows.\n\nWang Yuanzhe said: *\"One\"* is the measure of *jīng*, but instead of saying *jīng*, it speaks of *\"one\"*—for guarding *\"one\"* prevents *jīng* from dispersing.\n\nMǎ Jùjì said: *Yíng* and *po* are distinct matters, differing only in embracing *\"one.\"*\nThe Dao generates *\"one,\"*\n*\"one\"* generates water,\nwater generates *jīng*—\nfor *jīng* is the substance of *\"one.\"*\nEmbrace *\"one,\"* and it unites with *jīng*;\nabandon *\"one,\"* and it separates from *jīng*.\nWhen *jīng* is complete, *qi* is whole;\nwhen *qi* is whole, the spirit is whole—\nand with the spirit whole, one masters *hun* and *po* as a superior adept.\n\n*Jīng* is the source by which heaven, earth, and all things are generated.\n*Yíng* means \"to stop\"—\n*po* is yin.\nThe form’s master abides within the form and has a place to rest,\nso when speaking of *yíng-po* carrying, it means the spirit carries *po*.\nIf there is no spirit to carry it,\nthen it stagnates in dark yin,\nthe form scatters, the spirit departs,\nand it decays with all things below.\nBut if the spirit constantly carries *po* without being carried by it,\nthen the refined yang-spirit consumes the yin-*po*,\nand the body transforms into the Dao.\n\nThe matter lies in embracing *\"one\"* without leaving *\"one\"*—that is *jīng*.\nEmbrace *\"one,\"* and *jīng* unites with the spirit without separation,\nthen gather the spirit with *jīng*,\ndirect the form with the spirit,\npreserve the spirit with the form—\nwhen the three merge into one,\nthe Dao is complete.\nThose who seek this Way must take *jīng* as the foundation.\nZhuangzi said:\n*\"Not departing from jīng\"* is called the *shénrén* (spirit-person)—\nthis teaches nurturing *jīng*.\n\nCan you concentrate *qi* and achieve softness like an infant?\nZhuǎn Wēi commented:\n*\"Speaking of those who practice concentrating qi and achieving softness,\nthey should be as pure and harmonious as an infant.\"*\nIf one can be as pure and harmonious as an infant,\nthen they have attained the art of concentrating *qi* and achieving softness.\n\nWhen *jīng* is complete, the spirit reigns;\nwhen the spirit reigns, it can command *qi*.\nWith the spirit concentrated over *qi*,\njoy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure do not control it—\nthis is how softness is achieved.\n*\"Concentrated\"* means possessing and wielding authority;\n*\"soft\"* means harmonious without violence.\nWhen *qi* achieves softness,\nit should be like the heart of an infant.\nDesires unarisen, intent focused, mind unified—\nthroughout the day, one breathes deeply without strain,\nuntil the throat relaxes in perfect harmony—\nthis teaches nurturing *qi*.\n\nCan you purify and refine without blemish?\nMǎ Jùjì said:\nThis chapter establishes nurturing *jīng*, *qi*, and spirit as the root of Daoist practice,\nso it speaks of *\"no separation\"* for nurturing *jīng*,\n*\"like an infant\"* for nurturing *qi*,\nand *\"without blemish\"* for nurturing the spirit.\n*\"Purify and refine\"* refers to the heart.\n*\"Purify\"* means washing the heart;\n*\"refine\"* means carving it.\nWash it, and it becomes utterly still;\ncarve it, and it becomes utterly empty.\nWhen the heart is empty and still,\nno blemish remains.\nZhuangzi said:\n*\"Pure and unmixed, still and unchanging\"*—\nthis teaches nurturing the spirit.\n\nCan you govern the people and rule the state without action?\nHé Shànggōng said:\n*\"To govern the body, love qi and the body will be whole.\nTo govern the state, love the people and the state will be secure.\nTo govern the body, inhale and exhale *jīng-qi* without letting it be heard.\nTo govern the state, bestow virtue and kindness without letting the people know.\"*\nThis further explains the principle of embracing *\"one.\"*\n\nThe *Inner Alchemy Classic* states:\n*\"The sage takes the body as the state,\nthe heart as the sovereign,\nand *jīng-qi* as the people.\nWhen the people are content, the state is mighty.\"*\n*Jīng* is the foundation of the body;\ncherishing and conserving *jīng-qi* brings order to the body.\nThe way of cherishing *jīng* is rooted in embracing *\"one,\"*\nwhich is the natural Way—\nwhat more is there to do?\nThus it is said: *\"Can you act without action?\"*\n\nNow, those who refine *jīng* may pursue miscellaneous techniques,\ntreating *bān-yùn* (circulation) as their achievement,\nand engage in excessive actions—\nhence the warning against *\"non-action.\"*\nZhuangzi said:\n*\"Only through non-action can the few be preserved.\"*\n\nAll other commentaries focus externally,\nbut Hé Shànggōng explains both inner and outer meanings.\nReferring back to the earlier text,\nthose who speak of the body align with the Classic.\n\nCan the opening and closing of the *tiānmén* (celestial gate) achieve receptivity?\nWang Yuanzhe said:\n*\"The perfected one has no intention in cultivating spirit and breath;\ntheir responses are natural, without artificial prompting.\"*\nThis further explains concentrating *qi*.\n\nThere is fear that practitioners of *qi*-refinement may force *qi* too strongly,\nso it is also warned against *\"guarding the feminine\"*—\nfor *\"feminine\"* means achieving softness.\n\nCan one be enlightened and all-pervading without knowledge?\nThe commentary states:\n*\"Wisdom and sagacity, guarded by simplicity.\"*\nThis further explains *\"without blemish.\"*\nPractitioners of spirit-refinement,\npure and unadulterated, unobstructed and clear,\nshould not rely on knowledge—\ninstead, they must guard simplicity,\nhence the warning against *\"without knowledge.\"*\n\nNurture and preserve—\ngenerate without possession,\nact without reliance,\nnourish without domination—\nthis is called *xiāndé* (mysterious virtue).\nThe commentary states:\n*\"The sage preserves the spirit and knows transformation,\nharmonizing with the Dao as one body,\nthus matching the divine in nurturing all things—\nnothing is impossible.\nNurture them to fulfill their nature,\npreserve them to perfect their nourishment.\nWithout the heart of love or gain,\nhence generate without possession.\nWithout arrogance or self-aggrandizement,\nhence act without reliance.\nWithout artificial constraint,\nhence nourish without domination.\nSuch virtue is profound and distant,\ncontrary to all things—\nthus it is called *xiāndé*.\"*\n\nThis chapter establishes nurturing *jīng*, *qi*, and spirit as the root of Daoist practice—\nwhen the three merge into two,\nthe Dao is complete.\n\n---\n**Chapter Eleven: The Thirty Spokes**\n\nThirty spokes converge at one hub;\nwhen the hub is empty,\nthe utility of the carriage arises.\nClay is molded into vessels;\nwhen the vessel is empty,\nits utility arises.\nDoors and windows are carved for a room;\nwhen the room is empty,\nits utility arises.\n\nThe commentary states:\n*\"The unity of having and not-having,\nthe utility of entry and exit—\nthis is called the utmost spirit.\nHaving and not-having are contrasting forms;\ntheir essence lies in *yǒu* (having) as substance,\nand *wú* (not-having) as function—\nthe operation of yin and yang,\nthe principle of all things.\"*\n\n**Chapter Eleven: The Thirty Spokes**\n\nThirty spokes share one hub;\nwhen the hub is void,\nthe carriage’s function arises.\nClay is shaped into vessels;\nwhen the vessel is void,\nits function arises.\nDoors and windows are carved for a room;\nwhen the room is void,\nits function arises.\n\nThe commentary states:\n*\"The marvelous function emerges from the utmost void,\ntransformation concealed in unburdened stillness—\nlike a mirror without image,\nyet reflecting all things when they appear.\nThe sage employs the heart,\never resolving in this principle.\nThus, having is used for utility,\nvoidness for function.*\n\n*Zhong Hui says: \"The three matters above illustrate that having and voidness mutually depend and neither can be neglected.\nThus, having is used for utility—\nutility lies in substance.\nVoidness is used for function—\nfunction lies in emptiness.\nTherefore, substance is external,\nutility relies on emptiness to achieve completion.\nEmptiness is internal,\nfunction borrows substance for its manifestation.\nBut utility and voidness depend on each other—\nnone can be discarded.\nVoidness depends on having for utility,\nhaving borrows voidness for function—\nthe two principles interrelate.\nChe Hui’s commentary: *‘To cultivate the self,\none must use substance to nourish emptiness,\nand emptiness to guide substance.\nSubstance and emptiness mutually support the heart,\npreventing it from leaning toward either—\nthus attaining the sage’s utility and function.’*\n\n*This chapter elucidates the interdependence of having and voidness,\nutility and function,\nusing three matters to reveal the Great Dao.\nThe wheels and hub form the carriage,\nclay shapes the vessel,\ndoors and windows define the room—\nthis is having,\nwhich people depend on for utility.\nThe hub’s void allows the wheels to turn,\nthe vessel’s void holds things,\nthe room’s void shelters people—\nthis is voidness,\nwhich people depend on for function.\nHaving brings real utility,\nvoidness must be employed for function.\nVoidness is subtle,\nfunction requires substance as its basis.\nHaving and voidness mutually depend,\njust as form and spirit rely on each other\nand cannot be neglected in isolation.\nSpirit dominates form,\nform houses spirit—\nwhen form and spirit harmonize,\nthey mutually generate and perfect each other.\nThe ignorant in this world:\nThose who refine spirit are obscured by voidness,\nthose who nourish form are drowned in having—\nboth lose their way.\nYet they fail to understand\nthat this chapter uses three objects as metaphors\nto illustrate how having and voidness generate each other.\nIf one seeks to learn the Dao,\nand practices according to this,\nthen form and spirit both attain perfection,\nand align with the true Dao.\"*\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Twelve: The Five Colors**\n\nThe five colors blind the eyes,\nthe five tones deaf the ears—\n*The commentary states: \"Even if one indulges the ears and eyes in sounds and colors,\nthough possessing the forms of ears and eyes,\nthey cannot see or hear themselves—\nwhat difference is there from blindness and deafness?\"*\n\nThe five flavors dull the palate—\n*Wang Yuanze says: \"Man is born in stillness,\nyet moves with things.\nThe ears and eyes are inherently subtle and refined,\nbut when sounds and colors confront them,\ntrue perception is lost to illusion and decay.\nThe palate’s relation to flavor is no different.\"*\n\nChasing and hunting drive the mind to madness—\n*Lu Jifu says: \"When nothing can perturb the mind,\nstillness brings sanctity.\nTo pursue externals is to lose all thought,\nand thus the mind descends into madness.\nHow much more so with reckless hunting and chasing?\nThe *Taikang* [of the *Yuejiu*] speaks of the Five Sons in blame,\nand Ai Gong’s love of hunting is censured by the poets.\nTo indulge in external excess—\nhunting without measure—\nis to stray from true nature.\nWhat is this but madness?\"*\n\nRare treasures obstruct one’s path—\n*The commentary states: \"To covet rare treasures\nis to reach for what endangers life itself.\nGreed for wealth and honor—\nhow can one’s path remain steadfast,\nwhen such things ensnare the heart?\nThus, Zhonghuai praised Tang [of Shang] with: ‘He did not accumulate wealth and gain.’\nAnd Confucius told Zigong: ‘You do not await orders yet engage in commerce.’\nWealth’s obstruction of the path is evident.\"*\n\nThe moon’s gem and night’s jade—\nmere tools for harm.\n*Mencius says: \"Jewels and jade\nare sure to bring misfortune to oneself.\"\nThus, the sage nourishes the belly, not the eyes—\n*Zhong Hui says: \"True qi is internally abundant,\nhence ‘nourishes the belly.’\nExternal desires are discarded,\nhence ‘does not indulge the eyes.’*\nThe five tones deaf the ears,\nso the sage nourishes the belly, not the eyes—\nall analogies follow this rule.\nTo nourish the belly is to preserve spirit and qi,\nto not indulge the eyes is to abandon the six passions\nand let the eyes not gaze wantonly.\nThus, discard that and take this—\n*River Above Master says: \"Discard the eyes’ wanton gazing,\ntake the belly’s nourishment of spirit.\nThe eyes govern external vision,\nthe belly governs internal containment.\nThe sage fills the belly,\nnot letting ears and eyes enslave the heart—\nthus discarding the external-seeing eyes,\nand taking the receptive belly.\nThough the sage purifies the six senses,\nhere he speaks only of ‘not indulging the eyes’—\nfor once the eyes are controlled,\nthe rest may be inferred.\"*\n\n*This chapter speaks of the harm of the five defilements,\nto forget things and preserve true nature—\nthe sage’s principle of discarding and taking is thus revealed.\"*\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Thirteen: Honor and Humiliation**\n\nHonor and humiliation are like sudden shock—\n*Shu Wang says: \"Honor becomes humiliation\nbecause it is like sudden shock.\"*\n*Ma Jiuji says: \"Honor is the root of humiliation,\nfor it binds the heart to gain and loss.\nIf one is seen as honored by others,\nthe greater the shock—\nhonor is but another form of humiliation.\"*\n\nGreat calamity is like being burdened by one’s own body—\n*The commentary states: \"Honor is lower, nobility is higher.\nTo dwell in honor and take it as glory\nis to invite humiliation.\nTo hold nobility yet see it as a burden\nis to court the greatest calamity.\nNobility means exalted rank.\nWhen the heart clings to nobility,\nits affliction is great indeed.\nLike a body that moves and strains itself—\nwhat is honor and humiliation?\nHonor is the lesser.\"*\n\n*The commentary states: \"To crave fame or covet wealth,\nknowing how to advance yet not retreat,\nknowing how to gain yet not lose—\nto receive honor from others\nis to embrace the path of inferiority.\nWhy does honor become humiliation?\nBecause receiving honor from others\nplaces the power of gain and loss in their hands.\nIf one’s heart is weighed down by such gains and losses,\nhow can it remain unclouded?\"*\n\nZiwen served three times and resigned three times,\nwithout joy or displeasure in his face—\n*Was there any humiliation for him?*\nTo gain is like shock,\nto lose is like shock—\nthis is called honor and humiliation as sudden shock.*\n\nWen Gong said:\n*\"For the scholar, virtue and the Dao take precedence,\nwhile rank and emolument are secondary.\nThe former brings honor,\nthe latter brings humiliation.\nThe common crowd delights in their humiliation,\nyet trembles when they grasp it,\nand weeps when they lose it.\nTo possess it is as if it were already theirs,\nto lose it is as if it never existed—\nhow could there be any shock?\nIf, at the moment of gain or loss,\none’s heart still trembles with shock,\nthen this is true humiliation.\n\nLiu Xia Hui served as a magistrate,\nthrice dismissed yet never departing,\nwhile Zheng Kao Fu received three summons\nyet fled along the walls—\nthese are different indeed.\n\nWhat is meant by *‘treating great calamity as one’s own body’*?\n*The commentary states:*\nTo wield power and authority,\nto bestow rewards and punishments at will,\nto create blessings and instill awe—\nwhen the world fears you like a deity,\nwhen they revere you like the Supreme—\nthis is true nobility.\nYet the Sage does not burden himself with such nobility,\nand thus can long preserve it without exhaustion.\nIt is like a man who, when his limbs are severed,\nwhen his senses are dulled,\nwhen he is stripped of form and intelligence,\nbecomes one with the boundless—\nthen nothing enters that he does not find himself within.\n\nThe people of the world exchange their nature for things,\nand thus are burdened by things yet cannot forget their power.\nThey bind their form to their heart,\nand thus lose their heart yet cannot forget their form.\nTheir calamity is great indeed.\n\nWang Yuanze said:\n*Nobility lies above things,\nyet those who possess kingdoms and families cannot forget them—\nthis is a great calamity.\nIt is like a man who treasures his body yet is burdened by it—\nthen cold, heat, sickness, and pain all assail him—\nis this not a great calamity?\nMy greatest calamity is that I have a body.*\n\nHe Shang Gong said:\n*My greatest calamity is that I have a body.\nHaving a body means fearing its movement and labor,\npondering hunger and cold,\nindulging emotions and desires—\nthen misfortune befalls.\nThe body is a calamity,\nfor I cling to it—\nthis is a great calamity.\nBut when I have no body,\nwhat calamity remains?*\n\nCai Zi Huang said:\n*‘No body’ means not regarding the body as a self.\nIn this, one forgets the interplay of creation and self,\nand thus transcends calamity.\nThis is not the destruction of the body to achieve ‘no body’—\nrather, though the body exists, one does not cling to it,\nand thus, in having it, one is without it.\nAs with Confucius’ mother,\nwhen she mourned her son Ziqi—\nthis is the case.\n\nThus, to hold nobility for the world\nis to entrust the world to it.\nTo love the world with one’s body\nis to commit the world to it.\n*The commentary states:*\n*The world is a sacred vessel—\nwithout the Dao, it cannot function.\nThe world is a divine instrument—\nwithout the Dao, it cannot be preserved.\nThe Sage embodies the Dao,\nand thus can govern the world with ease,\nwhile the world rejoices in its support without exhaustion.\nThe next best course is to know one’s own nobility\nand not degrade oneself,\nserving things instead—\nthis is how one may entrust the world to them.\nTo know one’s love for life\nand not harm oneself,\nsuffering under things instead—\nthis is how one may commit the world to them.\n\nThus it is said:\n*The true Dao governs the self,\nits overflow extends to the state and the world.\nThe upright govern the world.*\n\nYet the vulgar gentlemen of the world\nendanger their bodies and abandon their lives\nto serve things—\nis this not tragic?\n\nWang Bi said:\n*Without things to exchange for one’s self,\nthis is nobility.\nWithout things to diminish one’s self,\nthis is love.\nOnly thus can one entrust the world to them.\nIf one does not use honor and humiliation,\ncalamity and joy,\nto exchange or diminish one’s self,\nthen only then can the world be entrusted to them.\n\nThe noble do not humiliate their bodies,\nthose who love do not endanger their bodies—\nonly thus can the world be entrusted to them.\nMen like Zizhou’s Zhi Fu and Wang Zi Sou are examples of this.\nThese two did not glory in their honor\nnor burden themselves with nobility.\n\nThis chapter speaks of humiliation arising from honor,\nforgetting honor means no humiliation.\nThe body is the root of exhaustion,\nforgetting the body means no calamity.\nHaving forgotten the burdens of honor and nobility,\none severs the worries of shock and calamity,\nand thus, in treasuring and loving one’s body,\none can entrust the world to it.*\n\n*End of Volume Two of the Collected Virtues of the Dao and Virtue Classic.\nBegin Volume Three of the Collected Virtues of the Dao and Virtue Classic.*\n\n**Chapter Fourteen: The Unseen**\n\nThat which cannot be seen is called *Yi*.\n*Commentary*: The eyes govern vision, and vision discerns objects. *Yi* is smooth and without distinction—beyond what vision can reach, hence called *Yi*.\nThe *Taiyi* was unseen in its primordial *qi*—thus it is.\n\nMaster Wang Yuanze said: The Dao extends to all things, equal and without high or low—beyond what the eyes can see. This illuminates the Dao.\n*Yi* means \"smooth and effortless.\"\nThe Dao is not a color, so it cannot be seen.\nThough unseen, it manifests as dark and as yellow—it cannot be called without color, only *Yi*.\n\nThat which cannot be heard is called *Xi*.\n*Commentary*: The ears govern hearing, and hearing discerns sounds. *Xi* is subtle yet audible—beyond what hearing can grasp, hence called *Xi*.\nThe Great Sound is subtle in its voice—thus it is.\nZhuangzi said: What can be heard has a name and a sound.\nThe Dao has no sound—beyond what the ears can hear, hence called *Xi*.\nThough unheard, it resonates with *gong* and *shang*—it cannot be called without sound, only *Xi*.\n\nThat which cannot be grasped is called *Wei*.\n*Commentary*: So subtle, so formless—who can grasp it?\nThe Great Image is without form—thus it is.\nFormless is *Wei*.\n*Bó* means \"to hold or seize.\"\nThe Dao is without form, so it cannot be seized.\nThough ungraspable, it manifests as yin and yang, soft and hard, short and long, round and square, hot and cold, light and heavy, bitter and sweet—within the formless, it forms. Hence it is called *Wei*.\n\nThese three cannot be summoned or questioned,\nso they merge into one.\n*Commentary*: The *Taiyi* was undifferentiated—no division of high or low.\nThe Great Sound is subtle in its voice—no distinction of clear or turbid.\nThe Great Image is without form—no measure of great or small.\nThe eyes have no use for their brightness,\nthe ears no need for their sharpness,\nthe body no exhaustion in its effort—\nthe Dao’s completeness lies here,\nin its depth beyond exploration,\nits mystery beyond attainment.\n*Qi*, form, and substance coexist yet do not separate,\nso they merge into one.\n\nThough merged into one, can it not be spoken of?\nThe three refer to *Yi*, *Xi*, and *Wei*.\nWhat cannot be summoned or questioned\nrefers to the formless, soundless, shapeless—\nthe mouth cannot speak it,\nthe script cannot transmit it.\nReceive it in stillness,\nseek it with spirit—\nit cannot be questioned and attained.\n*Hun* means \"to merge.\"\nThe three names merge into one,\nfor they are originally one body,\nyet people name them according to their approach—\nsometimes seeing, sometimes hearing, sometimes grasping.\n\nIts upper reaches are not bright,\nits lower depths are not dark.\nMaster Wang Yuanze said: All things, having substance, possess yin and yang—\nthe upper bright, the lower dark—this is inevitable.\nOnly the Dao, without substance, merges and becomes whole.\nThis speaks of the Dao’s fixed nature.\nZhuangzi said: Those who lose the Dao\nsee light above and become earth below.\n*Shéngshéng*—ineffable, returning to nothingness.\nMaster Lü Jipu said: *Shéngshéng*—straight and trustworthy.\nThough trustworthy, it cannot be named,\nso it returns to nothingness.\nThis is called the \"form of no-form,\nthe image of no-image\"—\nthis is called *hūhuǎng*.\nMaster Zuan Wei said: To return to nothingness is not to speak of emptiness or stillness.\nWithin the formless, it shapes all forms;\nwithin the imageless, it transforms all images.\nTo say it is \"having\" yet see no form—\nthis is having yet not having.\nTo say it is \"not having\" yet things arise from it—\nthis is not having yet having.\n*Huǎng* is the doubt of having in non-having,\n*hū* is the doubt of non-having in having.\nThe Dao, as a thing, is neither having nor non-having—\nits name cannot be fixed, hence *hūhuǎng*.\n\nApproach it, and you see no head;\nfollow it, and you see no tail.\n*Commentary*: Its beginning has no head,\nits end has no tail—\nso approaching or following,\nthere is what cannot be seen.\nMaster Su Shiru said: The Dao is everywhere—\nno front or back to be seen.\nHold the ancient Dao\nto govern the present.\nMaster Wang Bi said: Though ancient and present differ,\nthe Dao remains constant.\nOnly by holding it can one govern things.\nMaster Lü Jipu said: Without front or back,\nit is neither ancient nor present.\nThough neither ancient nor present,\nit is never without ancient or present.\nThus I say: Hold the ancient Dao\nto govern the present.\nTo know the ancient beginning\nis called the \"Dao’s measure.\"\nMaster Lü Jipu said: The \"ancient\" is not different from the \"present\"—\nto know the origin of the ancient.\nThe \"present\" is not different from the \"ancient\"—\nto know the source of the present.\nIf one truly knows the origin of the ancient,\none knows the source of the present.\nThe beginning has no origin,\nthe source has no coming—\nthis is called the \"measure of no-end.\"\nThe measure of no-end is the Dao’s measure.\nThe Dao cannot be held.\nYet by attaining this, one can hold it\nas *virtue*.\nTo hold *virtue* is called \"measure.\"\nMaster Wang Yuanze said: Pushing upward to the origin of nothingness,\none knows things have no source.\nThe Dao’s essence is attained—\nthe Dao’s measure,\nthe unchanging essence of ancient and present—\nthis is what Zhuangzi called the \"measure of no-end.\"\nMaster Li Tian said: This chapter speaks of the wondrous root’s application—\nwhat is there that it does not encompass?\nIf sought through seeing or hearing,\nit is utterly unattainable.\nIf examined for brightness or darkness,\nit is utterly undivided.\nImages cannot be named,\nbeginnings and ends cannot be seen—\nits use is difficult to fathom,\nyet it governs all things.\n\n**Chapter Fifteen: The Ancient Sage-Scholar**\n\nThe ancient sage-scholars were subtle, profound, and penetrating,\ndeep beyond recognition.\n\n**Shu Wang said:** The term \"sage-scholar\" (*shànwéi-sì*) denotes one who practices the Dao/Way. At its beginning, when one is still a sage-scholar, one has not yet departed from practicing the Dao/Way. At its end, when one becomes a sage, one is unified with the Dao/Way—so much so that the Dao/Way cannot be spoken of separately, for it is one with the Dao/Way. This is what is meant by \"subtle, profound, and penetrating, deep beyond recognition.\"\n\n**Ling Xian said:** The Dao/Way encompasses all names—this is what it means to be \"good.\" The practice of the Dao/Way reaches all things—this is what it means to be a \"sage-scholar.\" The previous chapter grasped antiquity to govern the present; this chapter governs the present while drawing upon antiquity. The previous chapter discussed the Dao/Way’s complete essence; this chapter speaks of the sage-scholar’s embodiment of the Dao/Way.\n\n\"Subtle\" (*wēi*) is the opposite of \"manifest\"; \"profound\" (*miào*) is the opposite of \"dangerous.\" \"Profound\" implies depths beyond measure; \"penetrating\" (*tōng*) implies endless transformation. The ancient sage-scholars who embodied the Dao/Way possessed this Way yet concealed it in mystery beyond measure—who could truly recognize them? Hence it is said, \"deep beyond recognition.\"\n\nOnly because they are beyond recognition does one forcibly attribute form to them. **Commentary:** The heavens’ height cannot be hastily measured; the earth’s depth cannot be hastily fathomed. When it says, \"round to cover, square to bear,\" it merely approximates their form. To forcibly attribute form to them—how could one truly grasp their ultimate essence? This refers to the following text: Only because the Dao/Way is vast and difficult to recognize does one forcibly attribute form to it.\n\nLike crossing a river in winter,\nor fearing one’s neighbors;\n**Master Lü Ji said:** The butcher Ding dissects an ox with ease, yet remains cautious—his gaze halts, his movements deliberate, the knife’s strokes barely perceptible. This is what is meant by \"like crossing a river in winter.\" Caution arises at the outset of action. Once the task is done, the pieces lie scattered like earth; he stands with his knife, gazes around, and sighs with satisfaction, then sheathes his blade. This is what is meant by \"like fearing one’s neighbors.\" \"Like\" implies careful restraint at the conclusion of action. Caution is rooted in preemptive stillness; \"like\" is rooted in lingering doubt after completion. \"Crossing\" refers to movement above the knees; \"river\" refers to the convergence of many streams. To cross a river is to encounter difficulty. In winter, the cold is extreme—yet to wade through a great river alone is to demonstrate that the ancient sage-scholars disliked action, only undertaking it when necessity demanded. They were always pressed into action, yet ever cautious in their approach. Hence it is said, \"like crossing a river in winter\"—once the crossing is made, there is no further hesitation. Yet when it comes to restraint, they are like the ancient sage-scholars, who were ever still and deep, never leaving their true nature. They always acted as if fearing their neighbors, gathering themselves without excess, repelling evil while preserving sincerity. No external things could probe them, for their hearts never strayed—hence it is said, \"like fearing one’s neighbors.\"\n\nLike a guest’s solemnity;\n**Master Wang Yuanze said:** They did not take action as their own responsibility, so their bearing was tranquil. **Zhuàn Wēi said:** A sage-scholar with the Dao/Way stands solemnly upright, his mind unscattered, as if a guest facing his host—how could he dare to be hasty? When the term \"container\" (*róng*) is used, it is like Dongguo Shunzi’s composed demeanor, which made others’ intentions fade. Hence, Tianzi Fang revered him as a teacher. When the term \"guest\" (*kè*) is used, it is like Li Contained-Light residing in a darkened chamber, as if facing his lord and father—hence, Sima Zimeng praised him so highly.\n\nLike ice about to melt;\n**Commentary:** Water congeals to become ice; ice melts to return to water—they are fundamentally one. Those who cling to one-sidedness are like water congealing. Those who align with the great harmony are like ice melting. The *Yì* says: \"Melt\" (*huàn*) is \"separation\"—separating from others without attachment, hence it is called \"melt.\" The *Sayings* say: \"Congealed yet dispersed is 'melt.'\" Water has no inherent ice; when it encounters cold, it congeals. Nature has no inherent obstruction; when it encounters things, it binds. A sage-scholar with the Dao/Way suddenly awakens to great insight—all affairs vanish, like spring ice melting away.\n\nLike the solid yet simple;\n**Commentary:** \"Solid\" (*dūn*) means the utmost thickness. Nature is fundamentally thick, like uncarved wood, before it disperses into vessels. This describes nature’s completeness. The *Classic* says: \"Return to the uncarved.\"\n\nLike the vast yet hollow;\n**Commentary:** \"Vast\" (*kuàng*) means the utmost breadth. Nature is originally boundless, like a valley’s emptiness, receptive yet responsive. This describes nature’s hollowness. The *Classic* says: \"The highest *virtue/power* is like a valley.\"\n\nLike the turbid yet undifferentiated;\n**Master Wang Bi said:** Concealing essence, hiding radiance—externally, they do not differ from things. They blend with dust and waves, hence it is said, \"like the turbid.\" **Master Yangzi said:** \"Unified, they are turbid; separated, they disperse.\" To be turbid is to blend with the world without separation, hence it is said, \"like the turbid.\" This is what Zhuangzi called \"aligning with things and flowing with their waves,\" differing from those who rigidly adhere to principles and reject worldly customs.\n\nThus, the sage-scholars who embody the Dao/Way: in winter, they dislike action, yet fear their neighbors and guard against later dangers; like guests who do not act as hosts; like ice that melts without obstruction; solid yet complete, vast yet hollow, turbid yet undistinguished by worldly norms—this is what is meant by \"deep beyond recognition,\" yet forcibly attributing form to them.\n\nWho could make the turbid clear?\nStillness gradually purifies.\n**Master Wang Yuanze said:** To clarify nature is like clarifying water. Overworking makes it murkier with motion; only by waiting in stillness does it gradually clear itself. A sage-scholar with the Dao/Way is never made turbid by things, for his stillness gradually purifies.\n\n**Master Cao Daochong said:** Would one follow the flow and forget to return? One merely clarifies stillness to gradually purify.\n\nWho could make the settled endure?\nMotion gradually arises.\n**Commentary:** A sage-scholar with the Dao/Way is both settled and in motion—when he acts, he does so with ease, yet remains rooted in his original nature. He is fixed yet able to respond to all things; he is empty yet fulfills all demands. Hence, stillness gradually purifies, and things cannot make him turbid. Motion gradually arises, yet things cannot unsettle him. The *Yì* says: \"Coming gradually\" (*lái xúxú*)—gradualness implies ease and self-adaptation. The ancient sage-scholars’ use of their hearts is not to stop with stillness as good, but to have stillness as their intention. Nor is it to generate motion as their achievement, but to have motion as their purpose. They follow their inherent nature, entrusting it to its own course, without urgency or haste.\n\nThus it is said: When stillness gradually purifies, ten thousand things cannot perturb his heart—who could make it turbid? When motion gradually arises, ten thousand things cannot ensnare his thoughts—who could unsettle him? If one seeks stillness with the intent to stop, he will be bound by things, and thus will stop. How then could he respond to things without harm? Those who preserve the Dao/Way do not desire fullness.\n\nMaster Ma Juji said: Those who preserve without desiring fullness do so because the Dao/Way gathers in emptiness. Fullness, when it exists, is easily discerned. Only the unfull can—\n\nMaster Lü Jifu said: Though it is not called emptiness but always fullness, it is to prevent people from being burdened by emptiness. If one is burdened by emptiness, then it is not emptiness. Hence it is said: *Some* do not desire fullness, yet do not desire fullness. Thus they avoid exhaustion while remaining unspoiled.\n\nMaster Wang Yuanzai said: Those who attain the Dao/Way never become full, thus those who perfect the Dao/Way never become new. The Dao/Way’s function endures through ten thousand ages without exhaustion, for it has no exhaustion, no renewal, no completion, no ruin. Exhaustion arises from renewal, ruin from completion. Though a sage-scholar may perfect the Dao/Way, if he remains ever renewed, then he will never know exhaustion or ruin. This chapter speaks of the sage-scholar’s embodiment of the Dao/Way, profound beyond recognition, concluding with the admonition: *Do not desire fullness*—for emptiness is its essence. Emptiness is void and boundless, without a single thing—how could the world ever comprehend it?\n\nThe ancients who preserved this Dao/Way—like Great Yu who did not boast of his achievements, or Confucius who did not dwell on his sainthood—sought only emptiness. Laozi embodied emptiness itself, while Yanzi embodied the reality of emptiness. Here, it is clear that the Dao/Way gathers in emptiness.\n\n**Chapter Sixteen: The Chapter of Attaining Emptiness to Its Utmost**\n\nAttain emptiness to its utmost, guard stillness with sincerity.\n\n**Commentary:** Nothing is more precious than emptiness, nothing more virtuous than stillness. Emptiness and stillness are the root of all things. Emptiness suffices to receive all things; stillness suffices to respond to all motion. *Extreme* means gathering all things to reach a point; *sincere* means establishing conduct to reach a point. If one attains emptiness while seeking its utmost and guards stillness to reach sincerity, then though myriad forms may be diverse, my heart remains ever clear, and though myriad changes may differ, my heart remains ever tranquil—this is called Heaven’s joy. Only those who embody the Dao/Way can partake in this.\n\nMaster Zhong Hui said: *Attain* means *reach*. To attain emptiness is to reach the utmost of emptiness. To guard stillness is to reach the utmost of stillness. When emptiness is attained, like a valley receiving all things, without a speck of dust accumulating—this is called *extreme*. When stillness is guarded, like water responding to all motion, without a hair’s breadth of disturbance—this is called *sincere*. As all things arise together, I observe their return.\n\nMaster Yan Zun said: Heaven and Earth return and invert, thus enduring forever. Man returns to sleep, thus attaining clarity. Dragons and serpents return to their dens, thus their scales shine. Grasses and trees return to their roots, thus they remain verdant. When transformation returns, spirit and clarity attain their proper places, communicating with emptiness, the soul rests, the vital breath is tranquil, each finds its place of ease, the will is serene, the qi harmonious, the blood and vessels balanced—these are but temporary returns to stillness, yet still they preserve their spirit. How much more so for those who long endure in the utmost Dao/Way?\n\nI am the *command* given to all things. With emptiness and stillness attained to their utmost, I observe the arising of all things, commanding them without being transformed by them—thus it is said: *I observe their return*.\n\nAll things, teeming and diverse, each return to their root.\n\nMaster Wen Gong said: Things arise from non-being, return to non-being.\nMaster Wang Yuanzai said: From nature arises use, returning to nature’s root—though movement and stillness differ, their principle converges.\n\nReturning to the root is called stillness.\n\nMaster Su Ziyou said: If one cannot return to nature, even if he ceases motion and stills thought to seek stillness, it is not stillness. Only by returning to the root can one attain stillness.\n\nMan is born in stillness—this is Heaven’s nature. To return to nature is to be still. Stillness is called returning to command.\n\nMaster Lu Tian said: Speaking of the root, one knows there is an origin; speaking of command, one knows there is nature. Thus, returning to the root is called stillness, and returning to command is nature. Zhuangzi said: From the root and origin, before Heaven and Earth existed, from ancient times it has endured. *From the root* is returning to the root, called stillness. *From the origin* is returning to command, called stillness. *From ancient times* is returning to command, called constancy. *From the origin* is without dependence on an origin. *From the root* is without emergence from a root. *From ancient times* is without passage through time. Though returning to the root is called stillness, returning to command is called constancy, and returning to constancy is called constancy, their essence is one.\n\nThe order of speech—first root, then origin; first nature, then command—when speaking of the root, it is called returning; when speaking of command, it is called returning. Returning is not yet attainment; returning is attainment. The root is not yet attainment; command is attainment. The depth of returning is profound. Returning to command is called constancy.\n\nMaster Wang Yuanzai said: To be born from the Dao/Way is called command. To return to command is to revert to one’s origin, uniting with the Dao/Way, thus enduring through eternity without change. To know constancy is called clarity.\n\nMaster Shū Wang said: Constancy is the designation of that which has been unchanging since before beginning. To know its constancy is called clarity. Outside the Dao/Way, all is unconstancy. Though the Dao/Way is true and constant, formless and nameless, without self-awareness of its clarity, few escape being obscured by things.\n\nNot knowing constancy leads to reckless action and ruin.\n\n**Commentary:** The sage-scholar knows the constancy of the Dao/Way, thus his actions align with principle and always meet with good fortune. Those who do not know constancy drift with things, encountering misfortune at every turn, and cannot even preserve their own lives—thus they are ruined. Master Sun Deng said: Unable to return to the root and guard stillness, one’s life is cut short and constancy lost—this is the source of ruin.\n\nThe multitude not knowing the true constancy of the Dao/Way,\ntake delusion for constancy,\nthus joy and sorrow arise,\nand action brings its loss—\nlife’s vitality then fades.\nThis is what is meant by reckless action bringing ruin.\n\nTo know constancy is to embrace tolerance.\nSu Ziyou said:\n*\"When lost in delusion, one clings to self and rejects others,\nseeing all things as enemies—\nhow then could one tolerate them?\nBut if one knows all is delusion,\neven foes shall be pitied and spared—\nwhat then cannot be embraced?\"*\n\nTolerance is virtue/power.\nHe Shang Gong said:\n*\"To embrace all without exclusion,\nvirtue/power is just and without partiality—\nno evil can withstand it.\"*\n\nThe *Records of Rites* states:\n*\"When the Great Dao prevails,\nthe world is held in common.\nNo man cherishes only his own kin,\nnor loves only his own children.\"*\n\nVirtue/power is sovereignty.\nShu Wang said:\n*\"To abandon private gain is to achieve virtue/power;\nto exhaust one’s measure is to attain sovereignty.\nVirtue/power is the root of virtue/power—\nsovereignty is its manifestation.\nTo act from virtue/power is to remain hidden within,\nto act from sovereignty is to shine outward.\nVirtue/power and sovereignty unite—\nthe Dao of inner and outer harmony.\"*\n\nCheng Xuanying said:\n*\"Sovereignty is to go forth—\nvirtue/power makes all things return.\"*\n\nSovereignty is Heaven.\nWang Yuanzhe said:\n*\"Sovereignty is the utmost of human conduct.\nTo exhaust human conduct is to align with Heaven.\"*\n\nHeaven is the Dao/Way.\n*Commentary*:\n*\"He who harmonizes Heaven, Earth, and humanity,\nand stands centered between them, is the Sovereign.\nOne and vast above all, encompassing without end—this is Heaven.\nHeaven, Earth, and humanity all move through it—this is the Dao/Way.\nTo exhaust humanity is to align with Heaven;\nto embody Heaven is to align with the Dao/Way.\"*\n\nThe Dao/Way is enduring.\nLu Yu said:\n*\"Enduring means lasting—\nto measure against the boundless void,\nneither coming nor going,\nthe mind plunged to its utmost,\nneither arising nor perishing,\nmysteriously unified by nature,\nindivisible—\nthis, when attuned to its principle, is called enduring.\nThus, one’s life may fade without peril.\"*\n\nThe *New Sayings* state:\n*\"What Heaven follows is the Dao/Way.\nThus it is said: Heaven is the Dao/Way.\nThe Dao/Way has neither ancient nor modern—\nthus it is said: The Dao/Way is enduring.\nWhen the Dao/Way reaches this enduring state,\none’s life may fade without peril—\nwho could surpass this?\"*\n\nThis chapter’s meaning lies in returning to the root and restoring vital command.\nThus it begins with emptiness and stillness,\nand concludes with the Dao/Way’s enduring nature—\nfor the Dao/Way takes emptiness and stillness as its foundation.\nTo grasp this and enter the Dao/Way\nis like abandoning the boat to wade across—\nhow ineffectual!\"\n\n**Chapter Seventeen: The Supreme Dao**\nThe Supreme Dao—\nthe lower knows its existence.\n\n「Wang Yuanzé said: In the age of the Three Sovereigns (*Sān Huáng*), there was governance without action (*wúwéi*), allowing the people to each fulfill their nature (*gé suì*) without knowing it was so. How could one claim personal credit for this?\n\nMá Jùjì said: To know of a ruler (*jūn*) but not know of one’s ruler—this is the age of the Three Sovereigns.\n\nAs Zhuangzi said: The Taiyi (*Tàishì*) moved with leisurely ease in sleep, and awoke with serene clarity. One moment he took himself as horse, the next as ox.\n\nThe *Supreme Dao* (*Tàishàng*) refers to the nameless ruler (*jūn*) of the most ancient times (*Tàigǔ*). *Tài* means \"the utmost,\" *shàng* means \"the highest.\" Governance without action, the utmost and highest—none of the later ages could surpass this, hence it is called *Supreme Dao*.\n\nTo say \"the lower knows its existence\" (*xià zhī yǒuzhī*) means knowing of a ruler but not serving as a subject.\n\nThe next stage is to be cherished by the people and praised by them.\nMá Jùjì said: Benevolent love (*huì ài*), this is *virtue* (*rén*), hence the people are cherished. Rewards and punishments (*shǎng fá*), this is *righteousness* (*yì*), hence the ruler is praised. Yet even when cherished, the people grow distant; even when praised, the ruler’s power is undermined—this is because they still fall short of the *non-human* (*fēi rén*) ideal.\n\nThis is the age of the Two Emperors (*Èr Dì*).\n\nAs Zhuangzi said: The age of the Yu (*Yú*) did not reach that of the Taiyi.\n\nYáo’s benevolence was like Heaven’s, and those who approached him did so as if drawn by the sun.\nShùn reached the outskirts of Dengyu, and ten thousand families came to him—this was cherishing the people.\nKāng Qú praised Yáo, and the songs of praise (*ōng gē*) accompanied Shùn—this was praising the ruler.\n\nThe next stage is to be feared by the people and scorned by them.\nZhàn Wēi said: When *virtue* (*rén*) and *righteousness* (*yì*) are lost, legal punishments (*xíngfǎ*) are established, and the people fear them.\n\nMá Jùjì said: This is the age of the Three Kings (*Sān Wáng*).\nAs Zhuangzi said: When *virtue* (*rén*) and *righteousness* (*yì*) extended to the Three Kings, the world was greatly alarmed. Those who loved wisdom exhausted the people, and then the age of cudgels and saws (*zhuī záo yāng yán*) came.\n\nWhen wisdom reaches its extreme, great deceit (*dàwěi*) arises. The clever exploit those below them, and the foolish scorn those above, while punishments are insufficient to deter them—this is the age of the Five Hegemons (*Wǔ Bà*).\n\nAs Mencius said: The Five Hegemons relied on this.\n\nWang Yuanzé said: When *virtue/power* (*dé*) is lost and governance (*zhèng*) fails, the people scorn the ruler.\nTrustworthiness is insufficient, and distrust arises.\n\nThe *Imperial Commentary* (*Yù zhù*) states: When bonds are not reinforced with glue or lacquer, and restraints are not secured with ropes or cords, this is the utmost trustworthiness. The Shang people made oaths (*shì*) and the people began to betray them; the Zhou people made assemblies (*huì*), and the people began to doubt them—this is because trustworthiness was insufficient.\n\nWhen the *Supreme Dao* is known only as \"the lower knows its existence,\" then one should not know it as trustworthy. In the next stage, where the people fear and scorn the ruler, one knows of deceit. When Jiāo Huá’s cunning and Jì’s scheming arise, distrust begins.\n\nEmperor Xuānzōng of the Tang (*Táng Míng Huáng*) said: Those who fear and scorn the ruler are all due to the ruler’s insufficient trustworthiness, causing those below to have distrustful hearts.\n\nEven so, the ruler’s words are still honored.\nEmperor Xuānzōng said: When the ruler is cherished and praised, it is because the ruler has words of *virtue/power* (*dé jiào*), hence his words are honored and he is cherished and praised.\n\nMá Jùjì said: When words are not inherently honored yet are still honored, this is why it is said that though it falls short of the *Supreme Dao*, the ruler’s words still transform without explicit action. From this point onward, emperors have *canons and admonitions* (*diǎnmó*), and kings have *oaths and proclamations* (*shì gāo*).\n\nWhen achievements are complete and affairs are settled, the people say: \"This is our natural state.\"\nThe *Imperial Commentary* states: The ruler’s achievements are the *Dao/Way’s* (*shèngrén*) remaining work. To make the people content with their food, pleased with their clothing, secure in their dwellings, and joyful in their occupations—this is the *Dao/Way’s* remaining work sufficient to complete the ruler’s achievements. Yet the people say only: \"This is our natural state.\"\n\nThey say: \"What has the ruler’s power to do with us?\" This is called the governance of the *Supreme Dao*.\n\nEmperor Xuānzōng said: When achievements are complete yet not seized, and affairs are settled yet without further action, the people say: \"The ruler acts as if this were our natural state.\" What part does the ruler’s power play in it?\n\nThis chapter speaks of the distinct transformations of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, how the people’s customs swayed, the *Dao/Way* descending into *virtue/power* (*dé*), *virtue/power* declining into legal punishments (*xíng*), and punishments failing to control—inevitably leading to deceit and scorn. This is because trustworthiness was insufficient in the ruler, and the people had their doubts.\n\n**Chapter Eighteen: The Dao/Way is Abandoned**\nThe *Dao/Way* is abandoned, and *virtue* (*rén*) and *righteousness* (*yì*) arise.\n\nThe *Imperial Commentary* states: When the *Dao/Way* is lost, *virtue/power* (*dé*) follows; when *virtue/power* is lost, *virtue* (*rén*) follows; when *virtue* is lost, *righteousness* (*yì*) follows. *Virtue* establishes the people, *righteousness* establishes oneself—this is far from the *Dao/Way*.\n\nHan Yu did not grasp the true intent of the Sage’s *virtue/power* (*shèngrén dé yì*), instead claiming that *seven* (*qī*) and *righteousness* (*yì*) were definitive names, while *Dao/Way* and *virtue/power* (*dé*) were empty titles. Laozi’s *small virtue* (*xiǎo rén*) and *small righteousness* (*xiǎo yì*) were but narrow views.\n\nAs Zhuangzi said: These are the *people obscured by delusion* (*bìméng zhī mín*).\n\nThe *Supreme Dao* is the same as the *Dao/Way* of the most ancient times without action (*wúwéi*).\nWhen *virtue* and *righteousness* are not manifest, it is like the sun at its zenith while all stars lose their luster. *Abandoned* (*fèi*) is the same as *hidden* (*yǐn*).\n\nAfter the Three Sovereigns, people’s hearts were not pure and sincere. The *Supreme Dao* was hidden and unseen, while *seven* (*qī*) and *righteousness* (*yì*) were established and the *Dao/Way* declined. Like fish leaving the ocean for stagnant pools, the people then valued *benevolent care* (*rúmò zhī ēn*) more.\n\nHaving lost the *Dao/Way’s* natural path, the people then valued *virtue* and *righteousness*’s blessings more.\nAs Zhuangzi said: The *Dao/Way* is hidden in minor achievements.\n\nWhen wisdom arises, great deceit arises.\nEmperor Xuānzōng said: Those who employ wisdom seek to establish laws. When laws are established, deceit arises, and then great deceit emerges.\n\nWisdom (*huì*) has wisdom (*zhì*) as its essence, and wisdom (*zhì*) has wisdom (*huì*) as its application. Wisdom has great and small distinctions.\n\nAs Zhuangzi said: Abandoning minor wisdom (*xiǎo zhì*), great wisdom (*dà zhì*) becomes clear.\nAs Confucius said: Those who delight in minor cleverness (*xiǎo huì*) are said to have wisdom—this shows that wisdom has great and small distinctions.\n\nThe *Supreme Dao* says: These are the ones who take cudgels (*záo*) as wisdom and keen scrutiny (*chá*) as insight, crafting clever laws and decrees—this is minor wisdom.\n\nOnce wisdom arises, the people’s deceit and trickery flourish.\nIf one instead observes both near and far with tranquil ease, doing nothing yet benefiting all, following their natural state without adding or detracting—when the true and pure customs prevail, how could there ever be great deceit?\n\nWhen the six bonds (*liù qīn*) are not harmonious, filial piety (*xiào*) and tender care (*cí*) arise.\nZhōng Huì said: If all nine kin (*jiǔ zú*) are in accord, then love and respect are without limit. When the six bonds are not harmonious, then filial piety and tender care are emphasized.\n\nThe blind and the deaf were considered foolish, yet Shùn was called a great filial son.\nZēng Xǐ was stern, yet his brother Zǐshēn was praised for nurturing him.\nWhen the state is in chaos and confusion, loyal ministers arise.\n\nShū Wáng said: The *Dao/Way* is hidden in the formless, and names arise from insufficiency.»\n\nThe *Dao/Way* hides in the formless, then there is no distinction between great and small.\nNames arise from insufficiency, then there are gradations of virtue, righteousness, wisdom, and sagacity.\n\nThe virtuous have that which they love.\nThe righteous have that which they distinguish.\nBecause of their love and distinction, this is how the Great *Dao/Way* is abandoned.\n\nThe wise know.\nThe sagacious discern.\nBecause of their knowing and discerning, this is how great deceit arises.\n\nThe filial honor their own kin, the tender care for their own children—this is how the six bonds become discordant.\n\nThe loyal are loyal to their own lord, and this is called loyalty; to another’s lord, it is called rebellion.\nTo be unclear is called benighted.\nTo be ungoverned is called chaotic.\nIn a benighted and chaotic age, loyal ministers arise to rectify their lord.\n\nThe *Transmission* says: *\"In turbulent times, true ministers appear.\"*\nAs when Longfang’s fame flourished under Xia Jie, and Bi Gan’s praise resounded under Yin Zhou.\n\nThis chapter speaks of the *Dao/Way* hidden in the small, and names arising from insufficiency.\n\n---\n**Chapter Nineteen: Abolish the Sage, Discard Wisdom**\n\nAbolish the sage, discard wisdom, and the people benefit a hundredfold.\nZhōng Huì said: Abolish the sage who makes laws, discard the wisdom of scheming, and people will return to simplicity and purity—thus their benefit is a hundredfold.\n\nThe maker is called the sage; the creator is called the wise.\nThe sage and the wise establish laws and decrees, desiring to curb deceit and suppress violence—yet how do they know that laws breed deceit and edicts spawn trickery? The people lose their true nature, ever drifting toward competition and strife.\n\nIf laws and edicts are abolished, the people will revert to their natural state and simplicity—how could their benefit be merely a hundredfold?\n\nZhuangzi said: *\"Sever the sage’s limbs, release the thief and bandit, and the world will begin to be governed.\"*\n\nAbolish virtue, discard righteousness, and filial piety and tender care return.\nWang Yuanzhe said: In an age of perfect virtue, parent and child naturally suffice.\nNow, if we further generate virtue and righteousness, then names and realities become entangled, gains and losses confused—chaos ensues among the people.\nFor what flourishes at the end must have decayed at its root—this is the *Dao/Way* of Heaven.\nFilial piety and tender care are the root of virtue and righteousness.\n\nSome say: The *Dao/Way* of Confucius and Mencius, of Yao and Shun, is centered on virtue and righteousness, while the *Dao* of Laozi is the true path. How can it be said that Xia valued birth as merit, while Zhou valued austerity as virtue—one makes them flourish and abandon their roots, the other withers them and returns to their essence?\n\nThe *Dao/Way* is the seasons; the sage adapts to the times.\nTo understand the *Dao/Way*, then Confucius and Laozi are the beginning and end of each other.\n\nAbolish cleverness, discard profit, and thieves and bandits vanish.\nWang Yuanzhe said: When cleverness and profit prevail, people’s desires grow extravagant, and their foundational pursuits decline—inevitably leading to theft.\nThe three matters above all harm the root through their excess.\n\nCleverness is ingenuity.\nThe clever are those who excel in deceit and profit.\nSeeing profit while forgetting righteousness—if ingenious scheming is abandoned, people will know shame; if the heart of desire is discarded, people will know righteousness—this is how thieves and bandits vanish.\nIf cleverness and profit are not abandoned, and only laws are multiplied to forbid them, this is how thieves and bandits proliferate.\n\nZhuangzi said: *\"Sever the artisan Tu’s fingers, and the world will begin to have its own cleverness.\"*\nAnd again: *\"Break the jade, shatter the pearls, and petty thieves will not arise.\"*\n\nThese three matters are insufficient as ornamentation, hence their reliance on external attachments.\nMa Jiuji said: Substance is in excess, ornamentation is insufficient—these three have strayed far from their root, serving only as superficial adornment. This is their insufficiency.\n\nThe four matters below are assigned to their natural attributes.\n\n**Seeing Simplicity, Embracing Purity.**\nShū Wáng said: It is not said \"guard simplicity\" but \"see simplicity\"—not \"return to purity\" but \"embrace purity\"—not \"have no selfishness\" but \"have little selfishness\"—not \"have no desires\" but \"have few desires.\" For only by seeing simplicity can one guard it; only by embracing purity can one return to it; only by having little selfishness can one achieve none; only by having few desires does one reach the point where there is nothing to be seen.\n\nSeeing simplicity reveals the true nature, untainted by external things.\nEmbracing purity preserves the whole essence, unharmed by external things.\n\n**Having Little Selfishness, Few Desires.**\nThe *Commentary* says: Self-seeking is selfishness, and nothing nourishes the heart better than its absence.\nFew desires and little selfishness—few desires clarify the distinction between inner and outer, true and false. Virtue is complete, and nature is restored.\n\nMa Jiuji said: \"Seeing simplicity\" belongs to the sage’s aversion.\nThat which is unmixed is called simplicity; to see simplicity is to see the *Dao/Way*, to see the *Dao/Way* is to take no action, and taking no action means there is no sage, no wisdom.\n\n\"Embracing purity\" belongs to virtue and righteousness.\nWhole material is called purity. To embrace purity is to embrace nature, to embrace nature is to be without artifice, and without artifice means there is no virtue, no righteousness.\n\n\"Little selfishness, few desires\" belong to cleverness and profit.\nSelf-possession is selfishness; having things is desire, and cleverness and profit arise from them.\nLittle selfishness and few desires mean cleverness and profit decline.\n\nThe *Zhuangzi·Tú Kuāng* chapter precisely clarifies the harm of sages, wisdom, righteousness, cleverness, and profit—this aligns with the intent of this passage.\n\nSelfishness is my body.\nLittle selfishness means not burdening oneself with cleverness and profit.\nDesire is the movement of nature.\nFew desires mean not disturbing one’s heart with cleverness and profit.\n\nLi Tian said: This chapter speaks of cutting off growth by uprooting the root, and suppressing overflow by blocking the source.\nIf lawmaking does not flourish, then true simplicity appears.\nIf ornamentation of righteousness is not applied, then purity is preserved.\nIf cleverness and profit are not practiced, then selfishness and desire are extinguished.\nThen Heaven’s harmony flows naturally, and daily life is effortless.\n\n---\n**Chapter Twenty: Abolish Learning, Have No Worry**\n\nAbolish learning, have no worry.\nThe *Commentary* says: Learning is to exhaust principle. When one is diligent in learning to exhaust principle, deliberating over good and evil, comparing order and chaos—how could there be no worry?\n\nLearning is to attain the *Dao/Way*; seeing the *Dao/Way* and then abandoning learning—reducing it, reducing it again, until one reaches non-action and yet nothing remains undone—then one follows the natural disposition of life, finding joy in whatever arises, and thus has no worry.\n\n**Chapter Twenty: Abolish Learning, Have No Worry**\n\nWen Gong said: The reason learning cannot be abandoned is to seek the *Dao/Way*.\nIf one abandons the root and pursues the branches, then laboring without result is inevitable—better not to learn and have no worry at all.\n\nThe *Absolute Learning* speaks of embodying the *Dao/Way*.\nTo embody the *Dao/Way* is to find joy in poverty and in prosperity, treating poverty and prosperity as the changing seasons—neither rejoicing in life nor dreading death, for life and death are but the natural cycles of night and day. When Heaven and Earth rejoice, all affairs dissolve into nothingness—what worry remains?\n\nMoreover, *Absolute Learning* does not mean to utterly discard learning.\nLaozi feared that men would drown in learning, letting words extinguish essence, drowning in knowledge, unable to embody the *Dao/Way*—thus he spoke of *Absolute Learning*.\nIf one does not learn, how then can one enter the *Dao/Way*?\nZixia said: The virtuous man learns to attain his *Dao/Way*.\nTo attain the *Dao/Way* is to forget the self entirely—this is why learning must be *Absolute*.\n\nAs for those who do not learn, they are empty and void—what need have they of *Absolute Learning*?\nYet Yangzi said: \"If a man does not learn, though he may have no worry, he is like a beast—how does he know the *Dao/Way* of the Sage's *Absolute Learning*?\"\nThe distance between *yes* and *no* is slight.\nThe difference between *good* and *evil* is minimal.\n\n*The Commentary* says: Though *yes* and *no* differ in sound, they arise from the same voice. Though *good* and *evil* differ in nature, they both depart from the *Dao/Way*.\nTo illustrate, the learned man is like *yes* or *good*, while the unlearned is like *no* or *evil*.\nLearning leads to wisdom, while not learning leads to folly—\nthe wise may err, the foolish may fall short,\nyet both equally stray from the *Dao/Way*.\n\nWhat men fear, they must fear.\n*The Commentary* says: The *Dao/Way* moves all things yet does not share the Sage’s worry—\ncalamity and fortune are shared with the people, but affairs are not.\nTo embody the *Dao/Way* is to have no worry;\nto engage with affairs is to know fear.\nIf one fears what men fear yet does not take it as a warning,\nfew will escape exhaustion.\nThus the virtuous man uses fear to reflect and correct himself.\n\n*The Odes* say: Fear the might of Heaven.\nThe Tang Emperor Ming Huang said: What common men fear is arrogance and wickedness.\nWhat the virtuous fear is worldly learning and striving—\nboth must be abandoned, hence the need for fear.\nThe masses labor in learning yet fail to grasp its truth;\nwhen all affairs are summoned, they only disturb the mind—\nthis is what men fear, and it too must be feared.\nIf one does not *Absolute Learning*,\nthere is no way to embody the *Dao/Way*—\nthus it is.\n\nOh, the wildness of it!\nHow endless it shall be!\n\nRiver Master Yang said: The world is in chaos, and men rush to study, seeking words—\nthere is no end to it.\n*Wildness* is the state of neglect.\nIf one does not *Absolute Learning*,\nthen one’s true nature is abandoned and neglected—\nthe worry of neglect has no end.\n\nThe masses bustle and rejoice,\nas if feasting on the grandest sacrifice,\nas if ascending the terrace in spring.\n\nWang Yuanzhe said: The transformations of nature are boundless; affairs are called *life*.\nOnly the Sage can unify past and present without change,\nwhile the masses follow transformations in vain,\nseeing beauty and evil, joy and gain in their *life*,\nand deeming it all beautiful.\n*Spring* is when all things flourish and depart from stillness,\nwhen they move and abandon the root for the branches.\n*The terrace* is where one gazes far upon all scenes.\nWithout understanding ultimate principle, all things generate emotions—\ntheir state is thus.\n\nAll things flourish with *yang* and congeal with *yin*.\n*Yang* governs motion, *yin* governs stillness.\nThe bustling state is the symbol of an active nature, delighting in joy.\n*Grandest sacrifice* refers to the cow—its flavor is the richest.\n*Spring* is the peak of the season’s transformations.\n*The terrace* is where one gazes far upon all scenes.\n\n「Thus, I liken the multitude to those who, through study, cultivate falsehood,\nwho, chasing fleeting scenes, lose their true nature—\ntheir state is as such.\n\nThe Dao is indeed insipid, without embellishment,\nsubstantial yet not ostentatious—\nthe delight of those who abandon learning.\n\nTo pursue learning is to lose the Dao,\nto stray from the natural stillness of one’s essence,\nto roam externally in vain—\ntheir hearts are restless, yet they savor profound truths\nas if relishing the richest flavors to nourish their appetites,\nand broaden their perceptions\nas if beholding lofty splendor to gratify their minds.\nThose ensnared by pleasure,\never more distant from the Dao.\n\nI alone am *pure*—\nbefore any signs appear.\n\nLike an infant yet to mature—\n*pure* in its simplicity.\n\n*御注* says: The *Classic* states—\n*\"Return to the infant state.\"*\nThe infant’s thoughts are still unformed,\ntreating near and far alike—\n*pure* in stillness, harmonious and gentle within,\nits brilliance not yet manifesting outward—\nthus like the infant yet to mature.\n\n*Pure* means\nstillness without flow.\nIn stillness, one attains the flavor of the insipid,\nrestoring the original unity of nature—\nhow different is this from the infant?\n\n*Buoyant* yet without attachment—\nas though belonging nowhere.\n\n*御注* says: The Sage rides the Six Dragons in accordance with the seasons to govern the heavens.\n\n*Buoyant* means\nto follow the natural course of things without leaning toward one extreme—\nthus like belonging nowhere.\n\n*Buoyant* is the appearance of movement.\nThe Perfect One in stillness aligns with the infant,\nin motion rides the transformations of all things—\nadapting to change without fixation,\nhence called *buoyant*.\n\nThe masses all have excess—\n*马巨济* says: Nature lacks excess or deficiency;\nwhat is called excess is merely external adornment.\n\nFeasting on the *Grandest Sacrifice* and ascending the *Spring Terrace*,\nall they gain is external adornment.\n\nThus, I speak of excess.\nThe masses pursue learning, increasing their knowledge—\nhence the excess.\n\nBut I alone seem abandoned—\n*马巨济* says: To seem abandoned is not true abandonment,\nmerely a reluctance born of insufficiency.\n\nTrue abandonment is for those who do not learn.\nThe Perfect One does not abandon learning—\nrather, they sever it to preserve the Dao,\ndiminishing their perceptions,\nas the saying goes: *\"For the Dao, one must daily diminish.\"*\n\nMy heart is that of a foolish man,\n*pure*—\n*马巨济* says: This belongs to the meaning of *\"I alone seem abandoned.\"*\nThe masses pursue learning to acquire wisdom,\nbut I alone abandon it—\nthus I am a foolish man.\nYet *pure* means untainted—\nthough foolish, I am not foolish.\n\n*Zhuangzi* says: *Pure* means one’s spirit remains undefiled.\nFoolishness is lack of wisdom.\n*Pure* means unadulterated.\nLearning never ceases to multiply wisdom,\nbut abandoning learning discards wisdom\nand seems like foolishness—\n*\"Great wisdom resembles foolishness.\"*\n\nThe common folk are sharp and discerning—\nI alone seem dim.\n\nThe common folk are keen and strict—\nI alone am *obscured*—\n*纂微* says: *Keen* means rigorous clarity.\n*Obscured* means spacious ease.\n\nThe worldly, through learning, govern with laws—\nrigid institutions, harsh decrees,\npriding themselves on their actions—\nthus the people barely survive.\n\nHence, the Perfect One follows Heaven’s natural course,\nconforms to the Dao’s patterns,\nand in yielding to the world,\nembraces spacious ease—\n*obscured*—\nso the people may preserve their true nature.\n\n*Zhuangzi* says: At the Dao’s utmost extreme,\n*obscured* and silent—\nthis is what is meant.\n\nMinor clarity is called *sharp*,\nlack of clarity is called *obscured*.\n\nThe common folk are keen and strict,\nperceiving minutiae, calculating hidden truths—\nthey deem this *sharp* clarity.\n\n*Sharp* is not true greatness.\nThose who abandon learning embody the Dao,\ndiscard wisdom, and merge with all things—\nwithout distinction—\nthus they seem *obscured*.\n*Obscured* is not innate dullness,\nbut a state of suchness.\n\nIf one governs by *sharp* clarity,\nrigor and strictness prevail—\n*\"A man too keen has no followers.\"*\nIf one governs by *obscured* ease,\nspaciousness and breadth emerge—\n*\"Constantly yielding to things,\nnever diminished by others.\"*\n\nSudden as if eclipsed,\n*tranquil*—\nas though no end in sight.\n\n*御注* says: The depths of stillness\nand the settled nature—\nthe complete embodiment of the Dao.\nChange without loss—\nthe Dao’s practical application.\n\nThe masses all have purpose—\n*马巨济* says: I alone seem *coarse*—\nlike a rustic.\n\n*御注* says: The osmanthus can be eaten,\nso it is pruned.\nThe lacquer can be used,\nso it is cut.\n\nAll know the use of useful things,\nbut none grasp the use of the *useless*.\n\nThe masses’ purpose is the use of useful things—\nI alone seem *coarse*,\nlike a rustic—\nthe use of the *useless*.\n\n*The Classic* says: *\"The heart that does not conform to the patterns of virtue and righteousness is called *coarse*.\"*\nAnciently, it was said:\n*\"To call the capital *beautiful* is to be *coarse*.\"*\n*\"To call the wilderness *rustic* is to be *coarse*.\"*\n*Coarse* means not embellishing wisdom,\n*rustic* means not perceiving beauty—\nthus the Perfect One remains *useless*.\n\n*马巨济* says: *Use* means application.\nThe masses’ learning seeks worldly application—\nwhat is called the use of the useful.\nYet how would they know\nthat abandoning learning is truly the most useful?\n\n*Coarse* and *rustic*—\nthis is so.\nFor *sharp* and *keen* mean\ndistinct clarity between root and branch—\nnot the *useless*.\n\nThus, I alone differ from others,\nand value nourishment from the *Mother*.\n\n*马巨济* says: This concludes the meaning of *\"the infant yet to mature.\"*\nThe infant takes the *Mother* as its foundation,\nbefore maturity feeds on its root—\nafter maturity, on its branches.\n\nThe Dao is the root,\nlearning is the branch.\nOthers feed on branches,\nI feed on the root—\nthis is how I differ.\n\nYet the Sage does not prize difference,\nwhile I alone do—\nthis chapter’s theme is to extol abandoning learning,\nfor only by differing from the world\ncan one save the world.\n\nThis section emphasizes abandoning learning.\nEvery sentence within carries the intent of severing learning.\nIf one does not abandon learning,\nthe more one hears and sees,\nthe more one drowns the heart—\nthe Dao becomes obscured.\nThus, the chapter ends by valuing nourishment from the *Mother*,\nfor the *Mother* is the Dao.\nOnly by abandoning learning can one cultivate the Dao—\nthis is how those with the Dao\ndiffer from the common folk.»\n\n「The *Dao De Jing* [\"Classic

the Dao; by this interplay, all things are born and thus possess virtue.\n\nThe Dao is ever nameless,\nhow can it be described in words?—\nthus its virtue is made divine.\n\nVirtue has form and substance,\nand all things share in it—\nthus the Dao is revealed.\n\n**Zhuangzi’s Annotation** [\"纂微曰\"]:\nThe Dao is ever nameless,\nonly virtue reveals it.\n\nVirtue without root,\nformed by following the Dao.\n\nSpeaking of those with great virtue,\ntheir appearance transcends all forms—\nhow can they be seen as crooked?\n\nOnly the appearance of one who follows the Dao\nbarely reveals their true state.\n\nIn their movements and demeanor, they observe propriety—\nthis is the peak of virtue.\n\nThose with peak virtue appear foolish,\nhow can they be seen as crooked?\nOnly those who follow the Dao\ncan be glimpsed as such.\n\nThus, when the eyes see, ears hear, nose smells, mouth speaks,\nhands hold, and feet walk—\nall are but the Dao.\n\nThus, the appearance of virtue follows only the Dao.\n\nThe Dao, as a thing,\nis but vague and indistinct.\n\n**Commentary of the Master** [\"御注\"]:\nThe Dao’s essence is absolute nothingness,\nyet its manifestations are wondrous—\nthis is why it is called a thing.\n\nYet all things are but the Dao.\nVague—where there is form to be likened,\nindistinct—where there are numbers to be traced.\nBut what is called \"having\" is but doubt of \"nothingness.\"\nThus it is said: The Dao, as a thing.\n\n**Gu Xuan’s Explanation** [\"顾欢曰\"]:\nTo speak of its definite existence,\nyet it has no color, no sound.\nTo say it is definite nothingness,\nyet it has trust and precision.\nSince its essence cannot be defined,\nit is called but vague and indistinct.\n\nThus, observing it as such\nis called following the Dao—\nthis is how one attains it.\n\n**Ma Jujie’s Explanation** [\"马巨济曰\"]:\nWhen nothingness appears as having—\nthis is vague.\nWhen having appears as nothingness—\nthis is indistinct.\nThis is the Dao’s thing.\n\nThe Dao, in its vague and indistinct nature,\nreturns to nothingness—\nthis is what cannot be contained.\n\n**Wang Yuanzhe’s Explanation** [\"王元泽曰\"]:\nThe Dao encompasses yin and yang.\nThe subtleties of yin and yang,\nwhen they appear as neither having nor nothingness,\nare called vague and indistinct.\n\nIndistinct yet vague—\nwithin it, forms arise.\nVague yet indistinct—\nwithin it, things manifest.\n\n**Commentary of the Master** [\"御注\"]:\nWhat is seen is called form,\nwhat is shaped is called thing.\nWithin vague and indistinct,\nforms and things are complete—\nlike vast space transforming into thunder and wind,\nlike great mass becoming water and fire,\nto bring forth change,\nto move the numinous and divine—\nthis is the Dao’s wondrous work.\n\nFaint and dark—\nwithin it, essence resides.\n\n**Commentary of the Master** [\"御注\"]:\nFaint—the extreme of seclusion,\ndark—the concealment of illumination.\nWithin faint and dark,\nthe origin of supreme yin,\nwhere Heaven’s One manifests—\nessence truly arises.\n\nIts essence is exceedingly true,\nwithin it, trust resides.\n\n**Wang Yuanzhe’s Explanation** [\"王元泽曰\"]:\nEssence—the beginning of form’s birth.\nEssence is never false,\nyet it is further called \"exceedingly true\"—\nbecause things may lose their proper order,\nand essence, likened to human artifice, may err.\n\nThe essence within faint and dark,\ngives rise to all things,\nand the things born,\neach follow their natural form and measure,\ntheir laws and patterns—\nonce a standard is set,\nthe future can be known without deviation,\nthis is called trust.\n\n**Zhuangzi’s Words** [\"庄子曰\"]:\nBefore form, there is division.\nEssence—the peak of Heaven’s virtue.\nTrue, then it is not false;\ntrustworthy, then it does not err.\nFrom ancient times to today,\nits name does not fade.\n\n**He Shang Gong’s Words** [\"河上公曰\"]:\n*Self*—to follow.\nFrom ancient times to today,\nthe Dao remains unceasing.\n\n**Wang Yuanzhe’s Explanation** [\"王元泽曰\"]:\nThe Dao is constant in name,\nnever changing or transforming.\n\n**Ma Jujie’s Explanation** [\"马巨济曰\"]:\nAs all things transform and change,\ntheir names shift accordingly.\nWhat was once called \"right\"\nis now called \"wrong.\"\nYet what remains steadfast through ages past and present—\nthe Dao alone.\n\nThus, it oversees all beginnings.\n\n**Wang Bi’s Explanation** [\"王弼曰\"]:\nAll beginnings—\nthe origins of things.\nTo oversee with the nameless\nthe origins of all things—\nthis is to oversee.\n\nTo oversee—\nas when one examines many texts.\nHow do I know all beginnings are thus?\nBy this.\n\n**Su Shi’s Explanation** [\"苏子由曰\"]:\nThe Sage knows how all things are one\nthrough essence.\n*Pattern*—law.\n*One*—the source of all multiplicity.\nThe Sage attains the world with

sincere?\n\n河上公曰：古者曲从则全身，此言非虚。\n**He Shang Gong** [\"河上公\"] says:\nIn ancient times, yielding and compliance preserved the body—\nthis saying was not in vain.\n\n诚全而归之。\nIndeed, wholeness returns to its source.\n\n御注：圣人其动若水，以交物而不亏。\n**Commentary of the Master** [\"御注\"]:\nThe sage’s movement is like water,\ninteracting with all things without depletion.\n\n其全其应若绳，以顺理而不失其直。\nTheir wholeness and responsiveness are like a measuring line,\nfollowing the natural order yet never losing their straightness.\n\n知洼之为盈，无亢满之累。\nThey know that *hollowing* [\"洼\"] is true abundance,\nand avoid the burden of arrogant fullness.\n\n知弊之为新，无夸耀之迹。\nThey know that *imperfection* [\"弊\"] is genuine renewal,\nand leave no trace of vain display.\n\n若性之自为而不知为之者，致曲而已。\nIf one acts according to nature’s spontaneous self-so,\nyet does not know who does so—\nthey merely achieve yielding.\n\n故全而归之，可以保身，可以尽年，而不知其尽也。\nThus, when wholeness returns to its source,\none can preserve the body,\nfulfill their lifespan,\nyet remain unaware of its completion.\n\n是谓全德之人，岂虚言哉。\nThis is called the person of *complete virtue*—\nwas this not sincere?\n\n锺会曰：诚能守曲，全必归之。\n**Zhong Hui** [\"钟会\"] says:\nIf one truly upholds yielding,\nwholeness will inevitably return.\n\n此章之义，养生之旨也。\nThe meaning of this chapter is the principle of *nourishing life*.\n\n其要在乎忘我。\nIts essence lies in forgetting the self.\n\n惟忘我，故委曲以应变，而不自恃一己之见。\nOnly by forgetting the self\ncan one bend and yield to respond to changes,\nwithout relying on their own limited perceptions.\n\n枉己而伸人，而不私一己之道。\nThey sacrifice themselves to benefit others,\nwithout hoarding their own Dao.\n\n知洼之为盈，无自伐之心。\nThey know that *hollowing* is true abundance,\nand thus have no pride in self-praise.\n\n知弊之为新，无自矜之行。\nThey know that *imperfection* is genuine renewal,\nand thus avoid self-boasting conduct.\n\n若性之自为而不知为之者，致曲以全，其形生而已。\nIf one acts according to nature’s spontaneous self-so,\nyet does not know who does so—\nthey merely achieve yielding for wholeness,\nand life’s form is all.\n\n故终始以曲，则全言之。\nThus, from beginning to end, if one persists in yielding,\nwholeness is fully achieved.\n\n希言自然章第二十三 希言自然。\n**Chapter Twenty-Three: Sparse Speech in Accord with Nature**\n\n希言自然。\nSparse speech in accord with nature.\n\n顾欢曰：希，少也。 人能爱气少言，则行合自然。\n**Gu Huan** [\"顾欢\"] says:\n*Sparse* [\"希\"] means *few* [\"少\"].\nIf a person cherishes qi and speaks little,\ntheir actions align with nature.\n\n纂微曰：夫至人有问，即应接物，即言动静以时，故合於自然。\n**Zuan Wei** [\"纂微\"] says:\nThe *perfected one* [\"至人\"] responds to inquiries,\ninteracts with things,\nand speaks of movement and stillness in due measure—\nthus harmonizing with nature.\n\n陆佃曰：夫物莫能使之然，亦莫能使之不然者，谓之自然。\n**Lu Dian** [\"陆佃\"] says:\nThat which cannot be made to be so,\nnor prevented from being so—\nthis is called *nature* [\"自然\"].\n\n飘风不终朝，骤雨不终日。\nGale-force winds do not last a full morning,\ntorrent rains do not last a full day.\n\n王元泽曰：风雨者，阴阳交感所为。 飘骤者，交感之过，所以不能久也。\n**Wang Yuanzhe** [\"王元泽\"] says:\nWinds and rains arise from the *interaction of yin and yang* [\"阴阳交感\"].\nGale-force and torrent are excesses of this interaction—\nthus they cannot endure.\n\n飘风，疾风也。 骤雨，暴雨也。\n*Gale-force winds* [\"飘风\"] are swift winds,\n*torrent rains* [\"骤雨\"] are sudden downpours.\n\n从旦至哺为终朝，自早及暮为终日。\nFrom dawn to midday is a full morning,\nfrom early to evening is a full day.\n\n飘风骤雨，气之暴戾，非出於常然也。\nGale-force winds and torrent rains are violent and untamed qi,\nnot arising from the usual order of things.\n\n故虽天地为之尚，不能有终朝终日之久。\nThus, even though the heavens and earth honor them,\nthey cannot last a full morning or a full day.\n\n人之言不出於自然，则多言数穷宜矣。\nWhen a person’s speech does not arise from nature,\nexcessive words will inevitably exhaust them—\nthis is fitting.\n\n孰为此者，天地。\nWho does this?\nThe heavens and earth.\n\n天地尚不能久，而况於人乎。\nThe heavens and earth themselves cannot endure—\nhow much more so for humans?\n\n御注：天地之造万物，风以散之委众形之自化，而雨以润之任万物之自滋，\n**Commentary of the Master** [\"御注\"]:\nThe heavens and earth create ten thousand things:\nthe wind scatters them, entrusting their forms to spontaneous transformation,\nwhile the rain nourishes them, allowing all things to grow naturally.\n\n故不益生，不劝成，而万物自遂于天地之间。\nThus, they neither *aid life* [\"益生\"] nor *urge completion* [\"劝成\"],\nyet all things flourish naturally between heaven and earth.\n\n所以长且久也。\nThis is how they endure long and last.\n\n飘骤则阴阳有缪戾之患，必或使之，而物被其害，故不能久。\nGale-force and torrent rains bring the calamity of *errant yin and yang* [\"缪戾\"],\ncompelling their use—\nwhen things suffer their harm,\nthey cannot endure.\n\n风雨者，阴阳交感所为。 飘骤者，交感之过。\nWinds and rains arise from the interaction of yin and yang;\ngale-force and torrent rains are excesses of this interaction.\n\n天地之大犹不能久，况人处天地之间，眇乎小哉。\nEven the vast heavens and earth cannot endure—\nhow much more so for humans, who dwell within them,\nso small in comparison?\n\n为於多言速灭可知。\nIt is clear that excessive speech leads to swift annihilation.\n\n故从事於道者。\nThus, those who follow the Dao—\n\n王弼曰：从事谓举动从事於道者也。\n**Wang Bi** [\"王弼\"] says:\n*Following the Dao* [\"从事\"] means *acting in accordance with the Dao*.\n\n道以无形无为，成济万物。\nThe Dao, without form or action,\naccomplishes and nurtures all things.\n\n从事於道者，以无为为君，不言为教，\n**Those who follow the Dao** treat *non-action* [\"无为\"] as their sovereign,\nand *non-speech* [\"不言\"] as their teaching.\n\n绵绵若存，而物得其真，\nThey persist like unbroken threads,\nand thus all things attain their genuine nature.\n\n与道同体，故曰同於道。\nThey share the same substance as the Dao—\nthus it is said: *They are in accord with the Dao*.\n\n道者，同於道。\n*Following the Dao* [\"道者\"] means *being in accord with the Dao*.\n\n河上公曰：道者，谓好道之人。\n**He Shang Gong** [\"河上公\"] says:\n*Following the Dao* [\"道者\"] refers to those who love the Dao.\n\n同於道，所谓与道同。\n*Being in accord with the Dao* [\"同於道\"] is what is called *aligning with the Dao* [\"与道同\"].\n\n德者，同於德。\n*Virtue* [\"德者\"] means *being in accord with virtue*.\n\n河上公日：德者，谓有德之人。\n**He Shang Gong** [\"河上公\"] says:\n*Virtue* [\"德者\"] refers to those who possess virtue.\n\n同於德，所谓与德同。\n*Being in accord with virtue* [\"同於德\"] is what is called *aligning with virtue* [\"与德同\"].\n\n失者，同於失。\n*Losing* [\"失者\"] means *being in accord with loss*.\n\n蔡子晃曰：有为躁竞，执教生迷，名为失。\n**Cai Zihuang** [\"蔡子晃\"] says:\n*Action* [\"有为\"] and *restlessness* [\"躁竞\"],\nclinging to teachings and thus generating confusion—\nthis is called *loss*.\n\n既为同失，不能虚心冥会，而言道失者，独失道也。\nIf one aligns with *loss* [\"同失\"],\nyet cannot maintain an empty heart to intuitively grasp the Dao,\nand still speaks of *losing the Dao* [\"道失\"]—\nthey have lost the Dao alone.\n\n自然之谓道。\nWhat is called *nature* [\"自然\"] is the Dao.\n\n从事於道者，悟道忘言，所谓与道同。\nThose who follow the Dao awaken to the Dao and forget speech—\nthis is what is called *aligning with the Dao* [\"与道同\"].\n\n得道之谓德。\nAttaining the Dao is called *virtue*.\n\n德者希言，所谓与德同。\n*Virtue* [\"德者\"] is marked by sparse speech—\nthis is what is called *aligning with virtue* [\"与德同\"].\n\n失道之谓失。\nLosing the Dao is called *loss*.\n\n失者多言，所谓与失同。\n*Loss* [\"失者\"] is marked by excessive speech—\nthis is what is called *aligning with loss* [\"与失同\"].\n\n同於道者，道亦得之。\nThose who align with the Dao,\nthe Dao also attains them.\n\n同於德者，德亦得之。\nThose who align with virtue,\nvirtue also attains them.\n\n同於失者，失亦得之。\nThose who align with loss,\nloss also attains them.\n\n河上公曰：与道同者，道亦乐得之。\n**He Shang Gong** [\"河上公\"] says:\nThose who align with the Dao,\nthe Dao also finds joy in attaining them.\n\n与德同者，德亦乐得之。\nThose who align with virtue,\nvirtue also finds joy in attaining them.\n\n与失同者，失亦乐得之。\nThose who align with loss,\nloss also finds joy in attaining them.\n\n信不足，有不信。\nWhen trust is insufficient,\nthere is distrust.\n\n锺会曰：我信不足於道，道亦不信应我，所以两相失。\n**Zhong Hui** [\"钟会\"] says:\nIf my trust in the Dao is insufficient,\nthe Dao also does not trust in responding to me—\nthus we mutually lose each other.\n\n只是同於道者，道得之。\nOnly those who align with the Dao\nare attained by the Dao.\n\n信於道者，道信之。\nThose who trust in the Dao,\nthe Dao trusts them.\n\n同於失者，道失之。\nThose who align with loss,\nthe Dao abandons them.\n\n信不足，有不信也。\nWhen trust is insufficient,\nthere is distrust.\n\n此章以希言为主。\nThis chapter takes *sparse speech* [\"希言\"] as its central theme.\n\n希言则以道而言也。\n*Sparse speech* [\"希言\"] means speaking in accord with the Dao.\n\n道偶而应，故合自然。\nThe Dao responds only when fitting—\nthus it aligns with nature.\n\n故下文云同於道者，道亦得之。\nThus, the following text states:\nThose who align with the Dao,\nthe Dao also attains them.\n\n同於失者，失亦得之。\nThose who align with loss,\nloss also attains them.\n\n观其失得之本，皆言之希与多尔。\nObserving the root of attaining or losing,\nit is all about the sparseness or excess of speech.\n\n多言之人，外则招愆，内则耗气，\nThose who speak excessively\ninvite external mistakes,\nand internally deplete their qi.\n\n人欲长久，希言内守。\nIf one seeks to endure long,\n*sparse speech* [\"希言\"] must be inwardly upheld.\n\n跂者不立章第二十四 跂者不立，\n**Chapter Twenty-Four: The Unestablished Do Not Stand**\n\nThe *unestablished* [\"跂者\"] do not stand.\n\n跨者不行。\nThe *overreaching* [\"跨者\"] do not walk.\n\n「To take *virtue/power* [\"德\"] as one’s guide,\nthen all who have sufficiency shall arrive.\n\nThe *unestablished* [\"跂者\"] are hasty to stand,\nthe *overreaching* [\"跨者\"] are hasty to walk—\nboth deviate from the natural way of standing and walking,\nthus they cannot endure.\nHence, though they stand, they do not stand,\nthough they walk, they do not walk.\nThose who establish their person and practice the Dao\nmust not seek swiftness—\nto follow its natural course,\nthen their person stands firm and the Dao is practiced.\n\nThe *self-perceiving* [\"自见者\"] lack clarity—\nShu Wang says: The *self-perceiving* [\"自见者\"] lack clarity.\nThus, those previously called *not self-perceiving* [\"不自见者\"]\nare the ones who see all things.\n\nThe *self-righteous* [\"自是者\"] are not manifest—\nHe Shang Gong says: Those who insist on their own correctness\nand reject others’ views\nare obscured by the multitude,\nthus they fail to shine.\n\nThe *self-praising* [\"自伐者\"] achieve no merit—\nGu Xuan says: When one undertakes deeds and aids beings\nyet claims the credit for oneself,\nonce the name is taken,\nthe merit lies not with the deeds.\n\nThe *self-conceited* [\"自矜者\"] do not grow.\nGuo Xiang says: Boasting and arrogance,\nnot forgetting one’s own merits,\nearn the disapproval of others,\nthus they do not flourish.\n\nAs for the Dao,\nit is said: *Excessive consumption, superfluous action* [\"余食赘行\"].\n\n*Excessive consumption* [\"余食\"] brings illness—\n*Superfluous action* [\"赘行\"] brings encumbrance.\nThings may hate it,\nthus those who embody the Dao do not dwell in it.\n\n*Excessive consumption* [\"余食\"] is when one’s nature overflows—\nHeaven’s deficiency, Earth’s transformation,\nand the hatred of all beings.\nThus those who embody the Dao do not dwell in it.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Five: The Undivided Unity of Things**\n\nThings are undivided in unity [\"有物混成\"],\nborn before Heaven and Earth.\n\n*Excessive consumption* [\"余食\"] is when one’s nature overflows—\n*Superfluous action* [\"赘行\"] is when one’s deeds exceed their purpose.\nThe Dao’s true essence stands alone,\nunpaired with things,\nenduring through all ages without flaw,\npermanent from ancient to modern times.\n\nIt moves in cycles without depletion [\"周行而不殆\"],\nfor its use is boundless in entering and exiting,\npervading all six voids [\"六虚\"].\nThe Dao’s wondrous function\nis everywhere without end,\nnever exhausted.\n\nAs the *Yijing* says:\n*\"In constant motion, it does not dwell;\nflowing through the six voids,\nit can be the mother of all under Heaven.\"*\n\nI know not its name,\nso I call it Dao.\nHe Shang Gong says: I do not see the form of the Dao,\nso I know not how to name it—\nseeing all things arise from the Dao,\nthus I call it Dao.\n\nI forcefully name it *Great* [\"大\"].\nTang Ming Huang says: I see things born in unity [\"有物生成\"],\nhidden without a proper name,\nso I use *pervasive birth* [\"逝\"] to mark its virtue,\ncalling it Dao—\nto encompass all without limit.\nIts essence is forceful,\nthus it is named *Great* [\"大\"].\n\nLu Ji Fu says: The Dao as a thing,\nwhen applied fills the boundless void [\"太虚\"],\nyet when abandoned is nowhere to be found—\nhow could *Great* suffice to name it?\nIt is merely a forced name.\n\n*Great* [\"大\"] is called *Passing* [\"逝\"]—\n*Passing* [\"逝\"] means *going* [\"往\"].\nThough all things are great,\ngreatness has limits and a resting place.\nThis Dao’s greatness passes without bounds,\nits origin is beyond what can be fully grasped.\n\nShu Wang says: The great\nthough beyond the six directions [\"六合\"],\ncannot escape its influence.\nThe smallest speck\ncannot evade its subtlety.\nThus *Great* is called *Passing* [\"逝\"].\n\n*Passing* [\"逝\"] is called *Far* [\"远\"]—\n*Far* [\"远\"] is called *Return* [\"反\"].\n\nShu Wang says: When *Far* reaches its extreme,\nit returns to the *Uncarved* [\"朴\"].\nThus *Far* is called *Return* [\"反\"].\n*Return* [\"反\"] means returning to the origin.\nWhen harmony is complete and fills the six voids [\"六虚\"],\nit is called *Far* [\"远\"].\nWhen near, it does not depart from oneself,\nthus it is called *Return* [\"反\"].\n\n*Far* [\"远\"] is beyond the *Unbounded* [\"无极\"],\nendless in its extent.\n*Near* [\"近\"] is within oneself—\nhumans do not perceive it.\n\nThe Dao’s essence is strong,\nthus it is named *Great* [\"大\"].」\n\nThus the Dao is Great, the Heaven is Great, the Earth is Great, and the King is also Great.\n\n*Commentary*: The Dao encompasses and sustains Heaven and Earth. Heaven covers all without limit, Earth bears all without measure, and the King stands between them, harmonizing with Heaven and Earth. Thus, the King is also Great.\n\nThe Dao encompasses all things. It wraps Heaven and Earth, vast beyond bounds, hence it is said that the Dao is Great. Heaven and Earth are the Great in form. Heaven is boundlessly broad, beyond measure, and Earth is boundlessly vast, beyond calculation. Hence, it is said that Heaven is Great and Earth is Great.\n\nUnder all Heaven, there is nothing not the King’s soil. At the edges of all lands, there is nothing not the King’s subjects. The King’s virtue aligns with Heaven and Earth, his Dao flows through the Three Realms [\"三才\"], and none surpasses the Emperor and King in greatness. Thus, the King is also Great.\n\nWithin the realm [\"域\"], there are four Great things, and the King occupies one of them.\n\n*Commentary*: From the Dao descending, there arises form and substance, hence it is said that within the realm, stillness is the Dao’s, while action is the Sage’s. The King can offer tribute to the Three Realms and harmonize them, making human conduct supreme. Thus, he shares substance with the Dao and function with Heaven and Earth, and is likewise called Great. The King is the culmination of human conduct.\n\nThe Dao was never confined by boundaries, yet this passage speaks of the realm [\"域\"], meaning though it is confined, it wraps all things without limit.\n\nHumans model themselves after Earth, Earth models itself after Heaven, Heaven models itself after the Dao, and the Dao models itself after Nature [\"自然\"].\n\nShu Wang says: Humans model themselves after Earth—this is the King’s greatness. Earth models itself after Heaven—this is Earth’s greatness. Heaven models itself after the Dao—this is Heaven’s greatness. The Dao models itself after Nature—this is the Dao’s greatness. For Nature [\"自然\"] is as if it transcends causes and conditions [\"因缘\"]. Neither cause nor condition, nor yet Nature. Yet the Dao’s Nature, when viewed by the self-cultivator [\"自学者\"], is called *Mysterious* [\"妙\"]. When observed by Laozi, it still retains traces of causes and conditions. Yet Laozi does not fail to grasp the Dao’s profound essence, nor does he exhaust the law within the law. Hence it is said: the Dao models itself after Nature.\n\nHumans speak of the King. Humans model themselves after Earth’s steadfast stillness, thus without action [\"无为\"], all under Heaven is accomplished. Earth models itself after Heaven’s non-action, thus without growth [\"不长\"], all things are nourished. Heaven models itself after the Dao’s Nature, thus without giving birth [\"不产\"], all things transform. The Dao is self-originating, self-rooted; before Heaven and Earth existed, it endured from antiquity, having nothing to model itself after. That which has no model is simply Nature itself. Hence it is said: the Dao models itself after Nature.\n\nThis chapter speaks of the *Mixed and Complete* Dao [\"混成之道\"], which precedes Heaven and Earth in birth. Its substance is lofty and independent, its function flows through the six voids [\"六虚\"], beyond description. Though the name *Great* is applied, it is still said.\n\nThough the Two Principles [\"二仪\"] are lofty and profound, and the King’s authority is supreme, all defer to the Dao.\n\nThe Dao is self-originating, self-rooted, without causes or conditions, yet naturally so.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Six: The Heavy as the Root of the Light**\n\nThe heavy is the root of the light,\nthe still is the master of the restless.\n\nRiver Upper Master [\"河上公\"] says: If the sovereign does not hold weight [\"重\"], he will not be revered. If governing the body does not hold weight, the spirit will be lost. Grass and trees, leaves and flowers are light, hence they wither and fall. The root is heavy, hence it endures long.\n\nIf the sovereign is not still, his authority will be lost; if governing the body is not still, the body will be in peril. The dragon is still, hence it can transform and vary. The tiger is restless, hence it is cut down prematurely.\n\nLü Jifu [\"吕吉甫\"] says: The light is first to respond [\"先感\"], the heavy is last to react [\"后应\"]. That which reacts is born from what responds, hence the heavy is the root of the light.\n\nThe still governs things [\"役物\"], the restless is governed by things [\"役於物\"]. The restless is often governed by the still, hence the still is the master of the restless.\n\nLiu Zhongping [\"刘仲平\"] says: The light arises from the heavy, hence the heavy is the root of the light. The restless arises from stillness, hence the still is the master of the restless.\n\nThus the virtuous person [\"君子\"] walks all day without straying from his burden [\"辎重\"]. Though he has splendid views [\"荣观\"], his repose [\"燕处\"] is serene and detached.\n\n*Commentary*: Splendid views are in things [\"物\"], repose is in the self [\"身\"]. Only when the self is at ease can things bring joy. Walking is swift with lightness, yet one cannot walk without a burden. Observing is glorious with restlessness, yet one cannot observe without repose. Having the burden of the burdened, yet not hindered in the Dao, then one can walk. Having the repose of repose, yet serene and self-sufficient, then one can observe. Hence it is said: the heavy is the root of the light, the still is the master of the restless.\n\nHow can the ruler of ten thousand chariots [\"万乘之主\"] bear a light body [\"身轻\"] while weighing the world [\"天下\"]?\n\nLü Jifu [\"吕吉甫\"] says: Even the virtuous person’s daily walk and his splendid views are thus, how much more the ruler of ten thousand chariots, bearing heavy burdens [\"任重\"] and traveling distant roads [\"道远\"], surveying all under Heaven [\"观天下\"]—can he not be still and heavy?\n\nForced to move, then he reacts [\"动\"].\nSensate and then he responds [\"感\"].\nUnable to help himself, then he rises [\"起\"]—\nthis is the heavy.\n\nWithout action [\"无为\"], then he is still [\"静\"].\nIf his movement is always at the point of compulsion [\"得已\"], and he cannot be without action, then he bears a light body while weighing the world, yet is not heavy. Not heavy, then he is restless, and not still.\n\nLu Tian [\"陆佃\"] says: All under Heaven [\"天下\"] is the sovereign’s burden and also his repose—what cannot be separated.\n\nThus it is said: How can the ruler of ten thousand chariots bear a light body while weighing the world? Lightness will lose his subjects [\"臣\"], restlessness will lose his authority [\"君\"].\n\n*Commentary*: Not heavy, then he lacks authority [\"威\"], hence he loses his subjects. If he does not lead yet seeks harmony [\"不唱而和\"], he violates proper order [\"犯分\"], hence he loses his authority.\n\nLu Tian [\"陆佃\"] says: The heavy is the sovereign’s virtue [\"德\"], the still is the subject’s conduct [\"道\"].\n\nSong Lingxian [\"松灵仙\"] says: If the heart is in turmoil [\"动乱\"], it will harm the *Mysterious Spirit* [\"妙神\"]. The spirit is the sovereign [\"神即君也\"]. This chapter warns the sovereign to take stillness and weight as his foundation.\n\nAll under Heaven [\"天下\"] is the sovereign’s stillness and weight. How can it be lightened with one’s own body?\n\nThose who cultivate the True [\"修真之士\"] also take stillness and weight as their foundation: they weigh their body yet do not burden it with things [\"不以物累形\"], they still their heart yet do not let things disturb their spirit [\"不以物乱神\"]. Body intact, spirit settled—this is the Dao’s completeness [\"全\"].\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Seven: The Good Way**\n\nThe good way leaves no tracks [\"无辙迹\"].\n\nShu Wang [\"舒王\"] says: The good way does not hasten [\"不疾\"], yet is swift [\"速\"]. The bad way does not move [\"不行\"], yet arrives [\"至\"]. Thus it is said.\n\n「Thus, there are no tracks.\n\nLu Yu says: To act in accordance with the Dao, one’s traces do not differ from things, hence there are no tracks.\n\nZhong Hui says: The practitioner of the good way has no visible achievements in virtue and name.\n\nSu Ziyou says: To ride upon principle and act leaves no traces. A carriage moves and leaves tracks, a lone traveler leaves footprints—so action indeed cannot lack traces. Yet the practitioner of the good way seeks it within oneself without stepping beyond one’s courtyard; their action emerges from non-action, hence there are no tracks—this is what is meant by \"non-action yet arrival.\"\n\nThe good speech has no flaws or censure;\n\nDu Guangting says: The practitioner of good speech attains the meaning and forgets the words.\nThus, there is no disease of blemishes or offense of reproach.\n\nLü Jifu says: The wise do not speak, and those who speak lack wisdom.\nSo speech indeed cannot lack flaws or censure.\nTo know why one speaks, speech arises from non-speech—hence it is said: The good speech has no flaws or censure.\n\nThe good plan requires no calculations or reckoning;\nThe Imperial Commentary says: To understand unity, all affairs are completed—how much more so for what is not mere numbers! Thus, without using calculations or reckoning, one adapts to myriad changes as though counting one and two.\n\nThe good closure needs no bolts or bars yet cannot be opened;\nShu Wang says: The practitioner of good closure allows no thing to enter through its gate, hence there are no bolts or bars yet it cannot be opened.\nWen Gong says: A well-governed state does not rely on the natural barriers of mountains and rivers.\nThe nine orifices are the gates of spirit and vitality.\nThe practitioner of good closure guards their spirit internally, preventing it from dissipating outward.\nThough internally there may be no bolts or bars, how could it be opened?\n\nThe good binding needs no cords or constraints yet cannot be undone;\nGu Xuan says: To bind with the Dao, though lacking cords, it is self-secured. To bind with things, though having constraints, it is not firm.\nThus, to constrain others with coercive force, even three armies may desert.\nTo bind with the Dao, even a single man’s resolve is hard to seize.\nWen Gong says: To confine the people, one does not rely on the boundaries of sealed borders.\nDu Guangting says: The practitioner of good conduct forgets all concerns, with no second thought; their stillness aligns with the Dao, merging with the True.\nNot even myriad green things can encroach, nor all temptations seduce—this is called good binding, how could it be undone?\n\nTherefore, the Sage always practices good rescue, hence there are none abandoned.\nCai Zihuang says: To benefit others is good.\nHong Ji says: To rescue all beings in the ten directions, one must first establish their own land.\nThe flow of good is ever enveloped in mystery, its blessings evenly spread, nurturing all life, returning to the Dao’s source.\nThe vulgar and deceitful, Emperor Shun taught them yet did not abandon.\nThe empty and foolish, Confucius exhausted all explanations.\nAlways practicing good rescue, there are none abandoned.\n\nThe Imperial Commentary says: Good is the Dao’s continuation in the unseen.\nThe Dao itself cannot be named as good.\nWhen good is named and established, the Dao departs and good becomes the world.\nThe Sage embodies the Dao to benefit All-Under-Heaven, hence these five goods.\nYet, in the case of people and things, none are abandoned.\n\nHowever, the Sage’s way of loving people and benefiting things, letting them fulfill their nature while humans find joy in theirs, is not arbitrary.\nTo invert unity is to lose the Dao; to cling to the constant yet neglect the Dao is to abandon its path.\nAll-Under-Heaven has lost its tranquil, still, and ever-present nature, daily sinking into the realm of sorrow and peril—who but the Sage could rescue them?\n\nThe *New Sayings* state: All things have their natural principles; indeed, there are those who defy and reverse them.\nAll things have their inherent nature; indeed, there are those who violate and shackle it.\nAll things have their proper fate; indeed, there are those who oppose and sever it.\nThe Sage, moved with compassion, thus employs their treasured virtue to rescue them.\nTo those who defy principle, they open what is blocked and make clear.\nTo those who violate nature, they remove what is harmful and bring ease.\nTo those who oppose fate, they restore what is severed and revive it.\nThis is called \"inheriting clarity.\"\n\nThe Imperial Commentary says: To inherit is to reveal without display.\nTo inherit clarity is to shine without blinding.\n\nLü Jifu says: These five aspects—principle, nature, fate, and their shared essence—are what the Sage understands through constant wisdom, rescuing at the moment of shared truth.\nThough they act, speak, plan, close, or bind, none know how it is done—\ninherited clarity cannot be seen directly.\nHence it is said: This is called inheriting clarity.\n\nTherefore, the good person is the teacher of the not-good.\nThe not-good person is the resource of the good.\nThe Imperial Commentary says: Resource refers to what is useful; there are not-good people.\nOnly then does one know good as beneficial.\n\nShu Wang says: The good person teaches the not-good.\nHence, the good person is the teacher of the not-good.\nWithout the not-good, one would not know good as good.\nHence, the not-good person is the resource of the good.\nTo not honor one’s teacher is to not cherish one’s resource.\n\nSu Ziyou says: The Sage has no personal intent in teaching, hence does not cherish their resource.\nAll-Under-Heaven has no intent in learning, hence does not honor their teacher.\nThe Sage does not merely forget All-Under-Heaven; they also make All-Under-Heaven forget them.\n\nLiezi, taught by Laozi, befriended Boyi, and attained the Way of the Immortal Wind.\nAfter nine years, he also did not recognize his master as his teacher nor his friend as his friend—\nhis inner and outer progress was complete.\nThis is called not honoring one’s teacher.\nConfucius, upon meeting Lord Shang of Yin, then declined further association and dismissed his disciples—\nthis is called not cherishing one’s resource.\nThough knowing the great confusion, it is called the ultimate mystery.\n\nThe Imperial Commentary says: The Dao’s ultimate mystery lies in not perceiving the myriad goods,\nhaving no need for cleverness or calculation.\nThe Seven Sages were all in confusion, yet none questioned their path—\nthis meaning converges here.\n\nLi Zhan says: This chapter speaks of the Sage’s subtle and hidden use of virtue,\nwhose manifestations are imperceptible.\nThough it is said they always practice good,\nthe mystery lies in their simultaneous forgetting—\nthus they can teach and speak.\nWhat they do not explain through intricate reasoning\nhas no means of reckoning or tracing.\nThis is the good teacher and resource as a path for gradual cultivation,\ncutting off all attachment to enter the gate of sudden enlightenment,\naligning with inherited clarity to rescue all things.»\n\n**The Daoist Canon: *Taking the Good* (Volume 5) – Collected Commentaries of Song Resident Scholar Li Lin**\n\n**Chapter 28: Knowing the Heroic, Holding the Feminine**\n\nKnow its heroic, hold its feminine.\n\nDu Guangting says: In the Upper Clarity Dao, there is the method of the One Feminine, and also the Three Chases and Five Feminines—all softening the will, harmonizing the spirit, to attain longevity.\n\nIt becomes the valley of all under Heaven.\n\nWang Yuanzhe says: A valley receives and channels all flowing waters. To hold the feminine is to remain in emptiness and stillness, receiving all things without obstruction, hence it is the valley of all under Heaven.\n\nThe heroic moves, the feminine is still. The Perfect One knows its movement yet does not follow it, always holding stillness without abandoning the True. Thus, it is said to be the valley below.\n\nThe Dao comes and returns to me like water flowing into a deep valley, hence it is the valley of all under Heaven.\n\nIt becomes the valley of all under Heaven, its constant virtue never departing.\n\nLü Jifu says: A valley receives from the ravine and delivers to the rivers and seas—receiving without resistance, delivering without accumulation. It is the thing that flows through without obstruction.\n\nTo flow through is to have constant virtue never departing.\n\nWang Yuanzhe says: Constant virtue is fixed and unchanging within me. \"Not departing\" means it remains within its nature, internal and not external.\n\nIt returns to the infant.\n\nWang Yuanzhe says: The infant holds harmony and unity, with no desires or thoughts yet formed. Its nature is pure and undispersed, its virtue profound—thus it aligns with the original.\n\nSuch is worthy of the name Great.\n\nMencius said: The Great Person does not lose the heart of the infant.\n\nThe feminine governs gentleness and stillness.\n\nThe infant’s bones are weak, its sinews soft; its *qi* is not violent, its desires and thoughts not yet formed. Its virtue is unchanging—this is the depth of contained virtue, like the infant’s purity.\n\nKnow its white, hold its black.\n\nWang Yuanzhe says: Black is the color of the North, where stillness cannot be fully described. The Sage establishes all things; without holding black, there is no foundation. This is verified by the emergence of spring and summer from the dark winter.\n\nIt becomes the model of all under Heaven.\n\nLü Jifu says: White, in color, is receptive; in things, it is brightness; in action, it is metal; in numbers, it is four. Black, in color, is untainted; in things, it is obscurity; in action, it is water; in numbers, it is one.\n\nTo know white and hold black is to receive no taint from all things. Like obscurity, like water, it ultimately embraces the One. Embracing the One, it can bend and yield, sink and be depleted—thus it can be the model of all under Heaven.\n\nWhite is clarity, untouched by things. Black is silent stillness, in numbers the One.\n\nThe Perfect One knows its clarity yet holds silent stillness in the One. All under Heaven follows and emulates this, hence it is the model of all under Heaven.\n\nIt becomes the model of all under Heaven, its constant virtue never erring.\n\nLü Jifu says: To be the model of all under Heaven is to be One in all things, thus its constant virtue never errs.\n\n\"Not departing\" means it does not stray from its original place, yet this does not guarantee it will not err. To not err is to not deviate.\n\nIt returns to the Boundless.\n\nLü Jifu says: The infant is a thing that focuses *qi* and softens, preserving its unity without loss.\n\nTo return to the Boundless, the infant is insufficient to describe it.\n\nLuóshī says: *Tè* means to fail or lose. If one abandons wisdom and holds foolishness, acts in accord with spontaneity, and virtue aligns with action, becoming the model for all things—manifesting in action yet returning to the Dao—since the Dao is inexhaustible, it attains the Boundless.\n\nOne is the Boundless of wisdom, two is the Boundless of life.\n\nKnow its glory, hold its humiliation.\n\nDu Guangting says: Glory is exalted honor. Humiliation is lowly shame. A ruler possesses the eight extremes, dominating the nine boundaries—this is exalted honor. To call oneself \"lonely,\" \"widowed,\" or \"not-grain\" is lowly shame.\n\nIt becomes the valley of all under Heaven.\n\nShū Wáng says: To know glory and hold humiliation is to guard with humility and respond well, hence it is the valley of all under Heaven.\n\nIt becomes the valley of all under Heaven, its constant virtue now complete.\n\nLiu Zhongping says: A valley can be empty and responsive, contain and receive—thus its constant virtue is complete.\n\nIt returns to the Uncarved.\n\nSu Shiru says: Not knowing yet not acting is inferior to knowing yet not acting to the utmost.\n\nTo know the heroic and hold the feminine is to know nature. To know white and hold black is to see nature. To know glory and hold humiliation is to restore nature.\n\nWhen all delusions are exhausted, dwelling in humiliation without regret, vast like the emptiness of a valley—things come and it responds—virtue is complete here, pure nature without mixture.\n\nThus it is said: It returns to the Uncarved.\n\nSōnglíng Xiān says: *Zú* means sufficiency. *Fù* is return. *Pǔ* is the true origin.\n\nAt first, knowing the heroic ends with holding humiliation.\n\nThe three practices of holding humiliation are complete as the essence of the Dao. Like an empty valley with nothing to contain, this is how constant virtue attains supreme virtue, thus it returns to true emptiness, merging with the Dao. Hence it is said: It returns to the Uncarved.\n\nGrasses and trees flourish as glory, wither as humiliation. What makes humans glory or humiliation is no different.\n\nThe Perfect One knows glory yet does not dwell in it, discards ornamentation and returns to the root, always holding humiliation—dwelling in what others despise, unburdened, for it is empty. Hence it is the valley of all under Heaven.\n\nThe valley is empty and receives, responds yet does not hoard. Virtue reaches this peak—exhausted, beyond addition.\n\nThus it is said: Its constant virtue is complete.\n\nThe Uncarved is the complete body of the Dao. To return to the Uncarved is to fully embody the Dao.\n\nThe titles \"lonely,\" \"widowed,\" \"not-grain\" are used by kings and dukes, hence embracing the Uncarved, all under Heaven returns. To return to the Uncarved is beyond the Boundless—this is the nameless Uncarved.\n\nThe Uncarved, though small, none under Heaven can subdue it.\nThus, to guard the female, guard the dark, guard humiliation is sufficient.\nWhy bother knowing the male, the white, or the glory?\n\nTo guard is to hold the Dao as mother;\nTo know is to grasp it as child.\nTo guard is to uphold the constant;\nTo know is to embrace the change.\n\nThe Uncarved disperses into vessels.\n**Commentary:** That which transcends form is called the Dao; that which falls under form is called vessels.\nVessels are the dispersion of the Dao.\nThey have shape and name, they have division and governance—\nUse them according to their purpose.\n\n**Zhuangzi’s Disciple Zhong Hui said:**\nThe Uncarved is the Dao.\nTo guard it is the Dao of sincerity;\nTo disperse it is the vessel nurturing humanity.\n\nThe Sage employs it,\nAnd thus becomes the ruler and the official.\n**Commentary:** The fullness of the Dao,\nThe Sage uses to govern himself.\nIts dispersion,\nThe Sage uses to benefit all under Heaven.\n\nWith form to be named,\nWith division to be governed—\nThus, he assigns roles and orders attributes,\nAnd all under Heaven is harmonized—this is called the ruler and the official.\n\n*The Classic of Changes* says:\nKnow the subtle, know the manifest,\nKnow the soft, know the hard.\nThe expectation of ten thousand men,\nIs of the same meaning.\n\n**Emperor Xuanzong of Tang said:**\nWhen virtue is contained and internally harmonized, it returns to the Uncarved.\nWhen constant virtue is applied, it disperses into vessels.\nOnce involved in form and vessels,\nThere must be refinement and coarseness—\nThus, the Sage employs them,\nAnd becomes the ruler of the common folk.\n\nHence, the great governance does not sever.\n\n**Su Shi said:**\nThe Sage, having returned to the Uncarved,\nThen disperses the Uncarved into vessels,\nTo respond to all things—\nLike a sovereign dividing authority,\nTo establish rulers and officials,\nAlso following the natural course of affairs,\nThough governed, there is no severing or fragmentation.\n\n**Cao Daochong said:**\nThe greatest of institutions\nLacks any trace of severing or fragmentation.\nFrom this chapter’s meaning,\nConstant virtue is the root—\nIf one guards its constancy,\nThen knowing it must be its change.\n\nThus, knowing the male yet guarding the female,\nIts virtue does not stray;\nKnowing the white yet guarding the dark,\nIts virtue does not falter;\nKnowing the glory yet guarding the humiliation,\nIts virtue is complete—\nTo this point, it is not false,\nBut simply returns to the state of infancy.\n\nWith no end, it shares the same body as the Dao.\n\nThe Dao endures through antiquity and the present, always existing.\nVirtue aligns with the Dao—\nThis is what is called the constant.\n\nThis is the true Dao for governing oneself;\nThe rest, for benefiting all under Heaven,\nEach follows its own capacity in use.\n\nHence it is said: The great governance does not sever.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Nine: On the Will to Govern**\n\nWhen one is about to take all under Heaven and act upon it,\nI see it as something he cannot avoid.\n\n**Zang Xuanjing said:**\n\"Will\" is the act of willing;\n\"To govern\" is the act of forcing—\nWhen one is about to force and willing,\nHe takes all under Heaven by might,\nAnd governs it with contrivance.\n\n**Wang Yuanzhe said:**\n\"Take\" is to take things as if they were his own.\n\"Govern\" is to contrive and act as if he were the maker.\nThose who have themselves and contrive,\nAre still caught between worry and peril—\nHow can they have leisure to govern others?\n\n**Su Shi said:**\nThe Sage’s possession of all under Heaven\nIs not a taking.\nAll things return to him,\nAnd he receives them as unavoidable.\nHis governance of all under Heaven\nIs not a contriving.\nHe follows the natural course of all things,\nAnd only removes their harm.\n\nTo take and govern is impossible.\nThe world is a divine vessel—\n**Commentary:** It is constrained by form and number,\nBound by square and round,\nAnd confined within the expanse of the heavens and earth.\nIt stands in the unfathomable,\nActs without fixed direction.\nTo govern it leads to ruin,\nTo grasp it leads to loss—\nThus it is called the divine vessel.\n\nTo rule all things,\nTo command all movement,\nThere must be those who are not vessels—\nOnly then can all under Heaven be governed.\nHence it is said:\nThe ruler must act without contrivance,\nYet employ all under Heaven.\n\n**Zhuangzi said:**\nThe Dao of Heaven wandered in the Yin Yang,\nReached the upper reaches of the Leaving Waters,\nAnd encountered a nameless man,\nWhom he questioned, saying:\n\"May I ask about governing all under Heaven?\"\nThe nameless man said:\n\"Go! Why should a vulgar man like you ask about that which is not fitting?\nTo govern is to ruin,\nTo grasp is to lose.\"\n\n**Wen Gong said:**\nTo govern is to harm the natural;\nTo grasp is to obstruct the flow of change.\nThe world is a divine and luminous vessel—\nIt cannot be forced by might,\nNor can it be rigidly grasped.\nAll things have nature as their essence,\nThus it can be followed yet not governed,\nIt can be guided yet not rigidly grasped.\nTo contrive against their constant nature,\nThus it must lead to ruin.\nTo grasp their coming and going,\nThus it must lead to loss.\n\nHence, things sometimes move forward,\nAnd sometimes follow behind—\nLike form and shadow never parting.\nSometimes warm to bring heat,\nAnd sometimes cold to bring chill—\nLike the seasons generating each other.\nKnowing strength alone,\nThen weakness and infirmity must come at times.\nKnowing flourishing alone,\nThen decline and destruction must follow at hand.\n\nThese are all the great emotions of creation,\nThe daily states of morning and evening,\nThe interplay of events and circumstances—\nIt cannot be otherwise.\n\nThen how can one govern and grasp it?\n\nThus, the Sage avoids excess,\nAvoids extravagance,\nAvoids arrogance.\n\n**He Shang Gong said:**\nExcess refers to indulging in food, sound, and color;\nExtravagance refers to clothing, adornment, and drink;\nArrogance refers to palaces, halls, and pavilions.\n\nGo beyond these three [excesses], dwell in moderation and act without contriving—\nthen the world will transform itself naturally.\n\n**Lu Tian** said:\nThe Sage, regarding the world,\nfollows its course without forcing,\ntrusts its unfolding without grasping—\nthus he avoids excess through kindness,\navoids extravagance through frugality,\navoids arrogance by never presuming to lead the world.\nThese three are how one attains the world.\n\nThis chapter speaks of how the world cannot be seized by force,\ncannot be taken by contrivance.\nIf one were to forcefully seize it,\nhow could one know the Sage acts only when compelled?\nIf one governs by contriving,\nhow could one know the Sage’s way of ruling without contriving?\n\nThus, those who act contrive will fail,\nthose who grasp will lose.\nTherefore, the Sage understands the reversals of the Eight Laws,\navoids the excesses of the Three Matters,\nand thus the nation’s fate extends long,\nand self-cultivation brings enduring life and vision.\n\n**Chapter Thirty: Assisting the Sovereign with the Dao**\n\nTo assist the sovereign with the Dao means\nnot to coerce the world with arms—\nfor such deeds return ill.\n\n**Su Ziyou** said:\nThe Sage uses arms only when compelled,\nnot to force victory over the world.\nThough victory may be won,\nthe calamity will return to haunt them.\n\nThe kings of Chu, Qi, Qin, and Han’s Emperor Wu—\nsome perished themselves,\nsome brought ruin to their descendants.\nWhat men abhor,\nwhat ghosts detest—\nnone escaped.\n\nGreat ministers serve the ruler with the Dao.\nIf they coerce the world with arms,\nthey assist the ruler with what is not his way.\n\nTo assist the sovereign with the Dao is already to refrain\nfrom coercing the world with arms—\nhow much more so if the ruler himself embodies the Dao?\nThe reason is that such deeds invite retribution.\n\nTo subdue the world with the Dao,\nthen the world dares not disobey.\nBut if one raises arms against them,\nthose who kill their fathers will have their fathers killed,\nthose who kill their brothers will have their brothers killed—\nas the saying goes: *\"What you send forth returns to you.\"*\n\nWhere armies march, thorns and brambles grow.\nAfter great armies, there are years of famine.\n**Commentary:**\nThe lower classes are drained of strength—\nthus thorns and brambles grow.\nThe upper classes defy the natural order—\nthus there are years of famine.\n*The Odes* say:\n*\"Soothing the myriad states brings abundant harvests.\"*\nSoothing the myriad states brings harmony among people,\nand harmony among people invites the harmony of Heaven and Earth.\nWhen farming is neglected and fields left untended,\nthorns and brambles grow.\nWhen slaughter is excessive and *he qi* is injured,\nthere must be calamities from Heaven.\nNeglect of farming precedes disaster,\nand disaster follows—\nthere will surely be years of famine.\nThus, the virtuous achieve victory without force,\ndaring not to seize through strength.\n\n**Lü Jifu** said:\n*\"Victory\"* refers to defeating the enemy.\nWhen the enemy is defeated,\nthe attackers lament their own ruin—\nas in *\"Zhòu attacks, and I lament from Bó\"*—\nthis is called victory.\nIt arises from compulsion, not from seeking force.\n*\"Victory\"* is the word for triumph.\nTang conquered Xia yet spoke of shameful virtue,\nreturned to Bó yet feared the precipice.\nVictory without pride,\nvictory without boasting,\nvictory without arrogance,\nvictory born of compulsion—\nthis is victory without force.\n\n**Chang Jifu** said:\nVictory without pride in one’s ability,\nvictory without boasting of one’s deeds,\nvictory without arrogance in one’s power—\nvictory that always arises from compulsion—\nthis is the way of victory without force.\nIf one prides in ability,\nboasts of deeds,\narrogates power,\nthen this is victory through force,\nnot victory born of compulsion.\n\n**Things flourish then grow old,**\n**Wang Yuanzhe** said:\nThe extreme leads to decline—\nthis is the inevitable nature of things.\nIn antiquity, those who met this fate were the Qin.\n\nThings grow strong through reliance on arms.\nThings flourish then decline,\narms grow strong then fail.\nThis is called *not-Dao*.\n**Commentary:**\nThe Dao has no fixed beginning or end,\nit does not align with the transformations of things.\n\n**Wang Yuanzhe** said:\nThose who embody the Dao\nencompass all changes without dwelling in any single thing—\nthus they have no thought of flourishing or decline.\n*Not-Dao* perishes early.\n\n**Lü Jifu** said:\nAll things wax then wane—\nthis is their nature.\nThe Dao values endurance,\nsoftness as strength—\nthis is how one persists without peril.\nIf one relies on arms to coerce the world,\nit is to abandon softness for strength.\nStrength must decline,\nand thus it is merely things—\nhow could this be the Dao’s way of transforming things?\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"Things flourish then grow old—\nthis is called not-Dao,\nnot-Dao perishes early.\"*\nThe Dao endures above antiquity without aging.\nThose who attain the Dao can repel aging and preserve their form—\naging is *not-Dao*.\nJust as arms grow strong then fail—\nhow could this align with the Dao?\nSince it does not align with the Dao,\nhow could it endure?\nThus it is said: *\"Perishes early.\"*\n\nThis chapter warns ministers:\nto assist the ruler with the Dao,\none must not coerce the world with arms.\nThe Dao values soft persuasion,\nnot coercion through arms.\nIf one coerces the world to victory,\nit is like things flourishing then declining—\nhow could this be the Dao?\n\n**Chapter Thirty-One: Fine Arms**\n\nFine arms are an inauspicious instrument.\n**Wen Gong** said:\nThe finer the arms, the greater the harm done.\n\n**Zuan Wei** said:\nThose who adorn spears, armor, and helmets as ornaments\nrevere what is not a benevolent instrument.\n*\"Fine\"* means adorned,\n*\"auspicious\"* means good.\nFine arms are strong armor and sharp blades.\nArms are a cruel instrument—\nthus they should not be adorned.\nThings may abhor them,\nso those who follow the Dao do not dwell upon them.\n\n**Commentary:**\nAuspicious matters bring good fortune.\nArms are a cruel instrument—\nthus they are called inauspicious.\nWhen arms are stored yet mobilized in season,\nthose who follow the Dao display virtue without showing arms,\nthus they do not dwell upon them.\n\n**Shu Wang** said:\nFine arms are strong armor and sharp blades—\narms are a cruel instrument,\nthus they are called an inauspicious instrument.\nThe previous chapter has already explained this in detail:\nno thing escapes their cruel harm,\nthus they are abhorred.\n\nThose who follow the Dao take compassion as their heart, thus they do not dwell upon arms.\n\nArms are a cruel instrument.\nWhen mobilized, all things abhor them—\nthus those who follow the Dao must never dwell upon them.\n\nThe virtuous in peace honor the left,\nin war honor the right.\n\n**Gu Huān** said:\nThe left is Yang.\nYang is the Way of life, thus in peace it is honored.\nThe right is Yin.\nYin is the Way of killing, thus in war it is honored.\n\nArms are an inauspicious instrument,\nnot the instrument of the virtuous.\n\n**御注:**\nThe left is Yang and governs life,\nthe right is Yin and governs killing.\nYang is virtue, Yin is punishment—\nthe virtuous honor virtue and fear punishment,\nthus it is said: not the instrument of the virtuous.\n\n**Wang Yuanzé** said:\nTo rule the realm is to act without action,\nto govern the people is with compassion and benevolence—\nthus arms are not revered.\nWhen forced to use them,\n\n**Zhuān Wēi** said:\nOne does not dare to be the aggressor but only the defender,\none does not dare to advance an inch but retreats a foot—\nall are acts of necessity.\n\nThe skilled in arms respond only when provoked,\nact only when pressed—\nalways arising from necessity.\n\nCalm and still is the highest virtue.\nTo win without delighting in it,\n\n**御注:**\nTo suppress tyranny and rescue chaos,\nto act only when forced—\nthus it is done out of necessity.\nWith no desire to conquer others,\nit is said that calm and still is the highest virtue.\nWith no desire to conquer others,\narms are not a source of joy—\nthus they are not delightful.\n\n**Chéng Xuányīng** said:\nCalm and still is non-action.\nThe virtuous heart cherishes non-action,\nthus though arms are used,\nthey are not considered delightful.\n\n**Zhang Jūnxiàng** said:\nCalm is without disorder.\nStill is a tranquil heart.\nCalm and still is the Dao.\nTo hold the Dao as highest—\nhow could one delight in arms?\n\nThose who delight in them\nare those who take pleasure in killing.\n\n**Wang Yuanzé** said:\nArms are meant for slaughter and destruction,\nyet to adorn them excessively,\nto make them beautiful and pleasing to behold—\nthis is to take pleasure in killing.\nIf one delights in arms,\nthen one delights in sending people to their deaths.\n\nThose who take pleasure in killing\ncannot achieve their desires in the world.\n\n**Zhuān Wēi** said:\nThe cruel and violent who delight in killing\ncannot be allowed to achieve their desires in the world.\nIf they do, they defy Heaven’s virtue,\nunleashing slaughter at will,\ntreating the people as grass and chaff—\nhow could Heaven aid them?\nIf Heaven does not aid them,\nhow could they achieve their desires?\n\nThose who take pleasure in killing\nmust not be allowed to achieve their desires in the world.\nAs rulers, one must not arbitrarily execute.\nThis is what Mencius meant by:\n*\"Only those who do not delight in killing can unite the people.\"*\n\nAuspicious matters honor the left,\ninauspicious matters honor the right.\n\n**Chéng Xuányīng** said:\nAuspicious refers to morning rites,\ninauspicious refers to funeral rites.\n\n**Hé Shànggōng** said:\nThe left is Yang, governing life,\nthe right is Yin, governing killing.\nThe General of the Left Wing is stationed on the left,\nthe General of the Right Wing on the right.\n\n**Hé Shànggōng** said:\nThe General of the Left Wing is lowly yet occupies the Yang position,\nfor he does not wield killing alone.\nThe General of the Right Wing is exalted yet occupies the Yin position,\nfor he alone commands killing.\nThis is treated as funeral rites.\n\nThe momentum of war\nplaces the right in the superior position—\nthus it is treated as funeral rites.\nWhen many are slain,\none mourns them with tears.\n\n**Cáo Dàochōng** said:\nAll under Heaven are the ruler’s people—\nby their obedience or defiance,\nsome are killed in great numbers—\nthus one weeps and grieves for them.\n\n**Yánggù** said:\nIt is made clear that this is not a delight.\n\nWhen victorious in battle,\none treats it as funeral rites.\n\n**御注:**\nThe *Yì* calls the army a poison to the world—\nthough victorious in battle,\nthere will always be those harmed by its poison,\nthus the superior position is given to mourning,\nas if the victor were in funeral rites.\n\n**Hé Shànggōng** said:\nIn ancient times, when victorious in battle,\nthe general occupied the position of the funeral master,\nwearing plain mourning garments and weeping.\n\nThe virtuous honor virtue and despise arms,\nusing them only when forced to punish inauspiciousness—\ntheir hearts grieve as if in mourning.\n\n**Lǚ Jífǔ** said:\nTo treat victory as funeral rites\nmakes it clear that arms are inauspicious\nand not delightful.\nTo mourn with tears\nmakes it clear that one does not delight in killing.\n\n**Lǐ Tián** said:\nThis chapter states that the virtuous should take morality as their village instrument,\nnot war and conquest as their achievements.\nIf one delights in arms and strength,\nthen killing will follow.\nIf not for funeral rites,\nthere would be no way to treat it.\n\n---\n**Chapter Thirty-Two: The Dao Ever Nameless**\n\nThe Dao ever nameless.\n\n**Wang Bì** said:\nThe Dao has no form,\nthus it cannot be named.\nTo be ever nameless is its constant—\nthus it is said: the Dao ever nameless.\n\n**Liú Zhòngpíng** said:\n\"Constant\" refers to an eternal, unchanging designation.\nThe height of Heaven,\nthe depth of Earth,\nthe brilliance of the sun and moon—\nthough great in nurturing life,\nthey endure through the ages,\nyet are not ultimately unchangeable.\nTheir forms appear above—\nthus I may call them *Qián*.\nTheir patterns manifest below—\nthus I may call them *Kūn*.\nThus, the luminous symbols descending—\nI may call them sun and moon.\nThese three are not beyond what I name,\nthus they are not nameless.\n\nBut the Dao—\nits ebb and flow, its fullness and emptiness,\nfaint and insubstantial,\nyet not in communion with anything.\nAncient and modern succeed one another in the boundless,\nas if naturally self-aware.\nNeither Yin nor Yang,\nneither soft nor hard,\nneither small nor great,\nneither round nor square,\nneither white nor black,\nneither *gōng* nor *shāng*—\nseen, yet unseen,\nheard, yet unheard,\ngrasped, yet unattainable—\nthis is called the ever nameless constant.\n\nThough crude and seemingly small,\nthe world does not dare to enslave it.\n\n**Hé Shànggōng** said:\nThough the Dao is crude and small,\nsubtle and formless,\nthe world does not dare to enslave those who follow it.\nCrude is the complete essence of the Dao,\nbefore anything began.\nThough small, it suffices as sovereign over all things.\nIf kings and lords could guard it,\nall things would willingly submit.\n\n「Lǚ Jífǔ said:\nWhy does the Dao/Way endow all beings with their beginning,\nand why do all things rely on it to be born?\nThen, who in the world would dare to enslave their own origin and their own source of life?\n\nThis is called the **true sovereign**.\nAll things possess a true sovereign—\nthis is what it means.\n\nIf kings and lords could guard it,\nthen they would rule all things with the true sovereign,\nand who would there be among all things\nthat obtained the true sovereign yet did not submit?\n\nThe Dao/Way is the master of all things.\nIf kings and lords uphold it,\nthen without resorting to coercive force or incentives of reward,\nthings would not know how, yet they would willingly submit.\n\nThe heavens and earth unite,\nand sweet dew descends.\nNo one commands it,\nyet all is balanced.\n\n**Imperial Annotation**:\nThe pure and undifferentiated Dao/Way,\nguarded without loss,\nnot only ensures that all things submit,\nbut also that it reaches the heavens above\nand coils beneath the earth below,\nflowing in harmony with the heavens and earth—\nthus, all things are interconnected and unified,\nand all are nourished by its grace.\n\nSweet dew is the harmonious *qi* of the heavens and earth.\n*The Classic of Changes* says:\nThe virtue/power of emperors and kings,\nascends to the **Tàiqīng** (Supreme Clarity),\ndescends to the **Tàiníng** (Supreme Tranquility),\nand permeates all living beings—\nthen sweet dew descends.\n\n**Wang Yuanzé** said:\nIf one guards the nameless essence of the Dao/Way\nas the foundation of governance,\nthen the rising and falling of Yin and Yang\nwill proceed according to their natural order,\nand the harmonious *qi* will respond accordingly.\n\nSweet dew is the product of Yin and Yang’s mutual harmony,\nnaturally and evenly bestowed\nwithout any need for command—\nit is the Dao/Way’s influence,\nreaching everywhere without fail.\n\n**Mencius** said:\nTo flow in harmony with the heavens and earth above and below—\nis this not the way of the Dao/Way?\nThis is what it means.\n\nThese two interpretations explain\nhow kings and lords, if they guard the Dao/Way,\nwill see the heavens descend sweet dew as an auspicious sign.\n\n**Wang Bì** said:\nWhen the heavens and earth unite,\nsweet dew descends without being sought.\nIf I guard its true nature and take no action,\nthen the people will not be commanded yet will be balanced.\n\n**Wén Gōng** said:\nKings and lords who guard the Dao/Way\nwill see things submit,\n*qi* harmonize,\nand the people transform.\n\n**Lǚ Jífǔ** said:\nThe utmost Yin is solemn and still,\nthe utmost Yang is radiant and vast—\nthe solemn arises from the heavens,\nthe radiant emerges from the earth.\nWhen these two interact,\nharmony is formed and things are born.\n\nIt is called the **measure** (*jì*), yet no one sees its form.\nWhen the heavens and earth unite to descend sweet dew,\nthis is the peak of harmony.\nKings and lords wield the Dao/Way,\nand all things submit to it—\nthat is all there is to it.\nWho can truly see its form?\n\nThus, no one commands it,\nyet all is balanced.\n\n**Sū Zǐyóu** said:\nThe undifferentiated *qi* ascends and descends,\nuniting to form one—\nand sweet dew descends,\nwetting all things uniformly without exception.\n\nThe sage embodies the utmost Dao/Way\nto respond to all existence,\njust as sweet dew reaches everywhere—\nthis is how they can govern all things.\n\nThese four interpretations explain\nhow the sage embodies the Dao/Way,\nand all things submit to it,\njust as sweet dew reaches everywhere.\n\nAt first, the Dao/Way was nameless.\nOnce names were established,\nthen one would also know where to stop.\n\nTo know where to stop\nis the means of avoiding peril.\n\n**Cài Zǐhuǎng** said:\nIf one knows where to stop,\nreturning from the end of named things\nto the root of the nameless,\nthen one neither dies nor lives—\nthis is the way of avoiding peril.\n\nNamed things are the scattered manifestations of the Dao/Way.\nWhen names were first established,\none should immediately know where to stop,\nand return to the nameless essence of the Dao/Way—\nthen one will not follow things’ transformations,\ncalmly self-sufficient,\nand free from all peril.\n\nIt is like the Dao/Way’s presence in the world,\ncomparable to streams and valleys converging with rivers and seas.\n\n**Imperial Annotation**:\nThe world is of one nature.\nThe Dao/Way’s presence in the world\nunites through nature,\njust as streams and valleys gather with rivers and seas\nthrough water.\nThose of the same nature are drawn to it,\nthose of the same kind respond to it—\nwhat need has the sage of governing?\nThey simply follow nature.\n\n**Lù Yù** said:\nStreams and valleys return to the sea,\nyet the sea does not summon them.\nThe people return to the Dao/Way,\nyet the Dao/Way does not contrive to gather them.\n\n**Wang Yuanzé** said:\nRivers and seas do not seek water to return to them,\nbecause they are the **reservoir** (*zhōng*).\nWhen water accumulates in abundance,\nthose with the same nature go to it.\nThe Dao/Way is the nature of the people.\nIf the sage gathers its purity and completeness,\nthen all living beings will submit to it,\nfor this is their nature.\n\n**Sū Zǐyóu** said:\nRivers and seas are the reservoir of water.\nStreams and valleys are its divisions.\nThe Dao/Way is the **origin** (*zōng*) of all things.\nAll things are its branches.\nAll are water,\nso streams and valleys return to their reservoir.\nAll are the Dao/Way,\nso all things submit to their origin.\n\nThis chapter speaks of kings and lords\nguarding the Dao/Way,\nand all things submitting to them,\njust as the heavens descend sweet dew,\nand all is balanced without command.\n\nThe Dao/Way is what all people share,\nthe same nature they all possess.\nKings and lords first grasp\nwhat all people share in nature—\nthen the world will not submit to them,\nyet they will go to it,\njust as water returns to the sea,\nnaturally and without effort.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Three on Knowing People**:\nTo know people is wisdom—」\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Three on Knowing People** (continued):\n\n「The **Commentary** says: Wisdom is like the eye—\nable to see a hundred paces distant yet unable to perceive its own lashes.\nTo discern the crooked and straight in others,\nas clear as distinguishing white from black,\nis the work of wisdom—\nto know people alone.\nTo know oneself is **enlightenment** (*míng*).\n\nThe **Commentary** says: *\"Returning to know oneself\"* (*fù yǐ zì zhī*).\nThe **Commentary** says: *\"Inner vision\"* (*nèi shì*) is called enlightenment.\n\nWisdom in knowing others\nleads to conflict with those you meet,\ndaily battling with the heart.\nBut returning to know oneself\nis to remain still and reflect upon the **root** (*běn*),\nto perceive oneself alone.\nThe **balance** (*yíng*) of Heaven and Earth,\nthe **mirror** (*jìng*) of all things.\n\nDuke Wen of Song said: *\"Self-knowledge and self-mastery are especially difficult.\"*\n\nMaster He Shang said: *\"When a person can know their own worth—whether virtuous or otherwise—\nthis is called *receptive listening without sound* (*fǎn tīng wú shēng*), *inner vision without form* (*nèi shì wú xíng*).\nThus, they attain enlightenment.\"*\n\nChéng Xuán Yīng said: *\"To illuminate and discern the realms before one,\nto mirror others—\nwhether their nature is vast or shallow,\nwhether their understanding is deep or shallow—\nthis is wisdom.\nTo know one’s own destiny,\nthe retribution of good and evil across the three ages (*sān shì*),\nwithout any obscurity—\nthis is enlightenment.\nThe **Scripture** speaks of *seeing the subtle as enlightenment* (*jiàn xiǎo yuē míng*).\nThe subtle refers to the **Dao/Way’s** subtle essence.\nAgain, *to know constancy is enlightenment* (*zhī cháng yuē míng*).\nConstancy refers to the **Dao/Way’s** true nature.\nWhen a person knows their own nature and destiny,\nreturns to the **root** (*gēn*), and aligns with the **Dao/Way’s** origin,\nunveiled by no external thing—\nthen they may truly be called enlightened.\nPeople merely know Heaven, Earth, and all things,\nyet fail to know their own source of life—\nthis is profound ignorance.\nTo conquer others is to have **strength** (*lì*).\n\nWang Yuán Zé said: *\"Strength can conquer others,\nyet it cannot conquer oneself.\"*\n\nThe saying goes: *\"Yì excelled in archery, and Gōu in steering boats—\nboth conquered others through strength.\"*\nThe character *victory* (*shèng*) is derived from *strength* (*lì*), yet placed below it.\nIf strength is insufficient, victory cannot stand.\nTo conquer oneself is to be **strong** (*qiáng*)?\n\nWang Yuán Zé said: *\"To conquer oneself is to restrain oneself and follow the Dao/Way,\nto be able to focus one’s **qi** (*qì*).\"*\n\nConfucius said: *\"The **root** (*gēn*) of a person desires this,\nyet they cannot attain firmness—\nthis is the conqueror of themselves.\"*\n\nYang Zhu said: *\"To conquer one’s own selfish desires is called *restraint* (*kè*).\"*\nWhen a person can restrain themselves,\novercome their own selfish desires and ambitions—\nthis is how they become truly **strong** (*qiáng*).\nNot the strength of *forceful aggression* (*qiáng liáng*), but the strength of *upholding gentleness* (*shǒu róu*).\n\nTo know contentment is to be **wealthy** (*fù*).\n\nEmperor Xuānzōng of the Tang said: *\"To know when to stop seeking is to have no greed—\nthis is true wealth.\"*\n\nWang Yuán Zé said: *\"Within the bounds of one’s nature,\nall things are sufficient.\nThe humble may dwell in seclusion without loss,\nthe noble may act with great virtue without excess—\nyet fools may cling to extreme nobility,\nonly to perish in their own corruption.\nThus, to know the wealth of the ten thousand things (*wàn zhōu*),\none may lightly regard the world and not be swayed.\nThis is true wealth.\"*\n\nMencius said: *\"All things are already complete within me—\nhow could I not be wealthy?\"*\nThis is the higher saying: *to know the limits of contentment is wealth.*\nThe next saying: *to take sufficiency from one’s nature alone is wealth.*\n\nTo act with **unyielding resolve** (*qiáng xíng*) is to have **will** (*zhì*).\n\nThe Duke of Shū said: *\"The superior man hears the Dao/Way,\nand acts with unyielding resolve—\nthus, to act with resolve is to have will.\"*\n\nSome will for high renown,\nothers for great gain—\nthis is not what is meant by *will*.\nOnly to act with resolve upon the Dao/Way\nmay one truly be called a man of will.\n\nNot to lose one’s place is to **endure** (*jiǔ*).\n\nMaster He Shang said: *\"When a person can regulate themselves,\nnot losing the **qi** they receive from Heaven—\nthen they may endure.\"*\n\nWang Yuán Zé said: *\"When nature is not swayed by external things,\nthen they endure.\"\nThis is to exhaust one’s nature.\n\nMaster He Shang spoke of *nurturing the vital essence* (*yǎng jīng*).\nWang Yuán Zé spoke of *nurturing the spirit* (*yǎng shén*).\nThe two sayings combined in one are wondrous.\n\nThe *I Ching* says: *\"The enduring is firm and long-lasting\"* (*yì dá jiǔ yě*).\nThe virtuous person establishes a steadfast **Dao/Way** (*lì fāng*).\nNot to change one’s **Dao/Way** (*fāng*) is to not lose one’s place—\nthus they may endure.\n\nTo die yet not perish is **longevity** (*shòu*).\n\nWang Bí said: *\"Even in death, if the **Dao/Way of life** (*shēng zhī dào*) is not lost,\nthen one attains complete longevity.\nThough the body perishes, the **Dao/Way** remains—\nhow much more so when the body lives yet the **Dao/Way** is not fully realized?\"*\n\nLù Xī Shēng said: *\"When the body dies yet the **Dao/Way** does not perish,\nthen it may be called longevity.\"*\n\nWang Yuán Zé said: *\"The death of a virtuous person is called *ghost* (*guǐ*),\nfor they have fulfilled their **Dao/Way** and returned to their true nature.\nThe death of a sage is called *god* (*shén*),\nfor they have never truly died nor truly lived.\nThe death of a fool is called *thing* (*wù*),\nfor though they live, they are already dead.\nThose who exhaust the **Dao/Way** and nurture the spirit (*shén*),\nthough their form may change ten thousand times,\ntheir true nature remains undiminished,\nwithout end—\nthis may be called longevity.\nThis reaches the **Dao/Way’s** ultimate decree.\"*\n\nLù Diàn said: *\"The *Lüzi*’s transformation,\nZhuāngzi’s non-death,\nand the Buddhist teachings of non-extinction—\nthese share the same meaning.\nThus, the sage’s life\nand death are spoken of together—\nthis is called *god* (*shén*).\nThe sage’s death,\nand life are spoken of together—\nthis is called *longevity* (*shòu*).\nThis is because their life and death\nhave never truly differed.\nFor the sage, life and death share the same form,\nand all things are held within the same **treasure-house** (*fǔ*).\nThus, the body is like the discarded husk of a cicada,\nor the shed skin of a serpent—\nmere temporary dwellings.\nThough the cicada’s husk is dead,\nits true nature has never perished.\nThough the serpent’s shed skin is rotted,\nits true nature has never been lost—\nwhy so?\nBecause the true essence, though it dies, is not extinguished.\n\nIt is said: *\"The perfect person is not burned by fire,\nnor drowned by water.\nTigers cannot seize them,\nand rhinoceroses cannot gore them.\nThey ride the void yet do not fall,\nand strike rocks yet are unobstructed—\nyet they have never truly died.*\nThen again it is said: *\"To die yet not perish—what does this mean?\nThe sage, in accordance with the times,\nmerely follows them.\nWhen the times demand action,\nthe sage does not forcibly avoid.\nWhen the times demand rest,\nthe sage does not forcibly act—\nthey simply observe Heaven’s will.\nThus, they have the ability yet do not exert it—\nthis is why they have life yet no death,\ndeath yet no perishing.\"*\n\nYán Zūn said: *\"To establish oneself in the world,\nto promote benefit and remove

respectively.\n[22] *‘Point at me, blow upon me’* – Likely referencing the *Zhuāngzǐ*’s metaphor of wind and water overcoming strength.\n\n「Zhōng Huì said: To subdue the rigid and strong, one must appear soft and yielding—first expanding, then contracting—then victory and defeat become apparent. The Tang Emperor Xuānzōng said: Compliance and submission enable the exercise of authority; when authority is wielded, one can govern all things. Thus, it is known that the soft and yielding must prevail over the rigid and strong.\n\nTaking examples from oneself: Teeth, though firm, wear out first, while the tongue, though soft, endures. Taking examples from nature: Mountains, though high, lose their strength, while marshes, though low, grow fertile. Fish cannot be removed from the depths, nor can a state’s most potent tools be revealed to others.\n\n*御注*: The depths are where fish conceal their bodies. Potent tools are what a state uses to subdue others. A fish as large as a boat, if stranded and loses its water, even ants can torment it—thus it cannot be removed from the depths. When a ruler is seen granting rewards, ministers exploit his authority. When a ruler is seen imposing punishments, ministers exploit his power. Rewards and punishments are instruments of governance and must not be displayed—how much more so the principles of governance itself?\n\nThe Sage wields potent tools yet does not reveal them—not because he relies on brute force, but because he possesses a subtle **Dao/Way**. He can exhaust the land’s resources without earning a reputation for cunning, dominate all things without displaying valor, and conquer without being defeated, attaining the **Way** of perpetual victory.\n\nYielding opens, concealing closes—endless transformations, guiding ministers and ruling the world without being fathomed. Thus, he governs others without being governed himself, for his power originates from above and rests with the sovereign, and the world is thereby governed.\n\nLǚ Jìfǔ said: Just as a fish cannot be separated from the depths, so too must a person not abandon softness and yielding—otherwise, they are doomed to death.\n\nThe ultimate softness traverses the ultimate rigidity; without entering any gap, it is the sharpest of tools. Wielding such tools to govern the world, a state’s strategies lie in the intangible—how can one reveal their origins?\n\nThus it is said: *A state’s most potent tools must not be revealed to others.*\n\nWáng Yuànzé said: Fish submit to softness and yielding, hiding in the depths to preserve themselves. The Sage retreats into seclusion, yet wields supreme authority alone, guiding all things beyond comprehension. Thus, he turns the heavens and earth effortlessly, yet none perceive his strength; he commands all under heaven, yet none attribute it to force. Would he expose his divine essence and let the masses debate it?\n\nI have pondered this: What distinguishes the Sage from others is his foresight (*knowing the few*). If one meets things with rigidity and strength, those things’ rigidity and strength become insurmountable. All under heaven rely on rigidity and strength to conquer. I alone dwell in softness and non-contention, yet when I act, who can resist?\n\nObserve the **Dao/Way** of Heaven: Autumn and winter give way to spring and summer—another verification. The Sage hides in the depths, yet presents softness and yielding as his exterior, guiding all things within their natural unfolding, while his essence remains unknown to all. This is what is called *secret action, solitary transformation*.\n\nThe *Yì* (I Ching) says: *Compliance enables the exercise of authority.*\nThe *Zhuāngzǐ* says: *Fish are trapped by calculation*—their meaning aligns here.\n\nThis passage speaks of compliance enabling authority, of softness and yielding prevailing over rigidity and strength. First expanding, then contracting—softness and yielding prevailing over rigidity and strength is evident. A person cannot abandon softness and yielding, just as a fish cannot be removed from the depths. The Sage wields potent tools yet does not reveal them—not because he relies on rigidity and strength, but because he embodies softness and yielding. Thus, he attains the **Way** of perpetual victory.\n\n---\n**Chapter Thirty-Seven: The Dao/Way Constantly Does Not-Act, Yet Does Not Fail to Act**\n\nShū Wáng said: Earlier, it was said that the **Dao/Way** constantly has no name—speaking of the **Dao/Way**’s essence. This chapter speaks of the **Dao/Way** constantly not-acting—speaking of the **Dao/Way**’s transformations.\n\nLíng Qì said: The **Dao/Way** as a formless form stands independent and unchanging, yet its form constantly resides in the utmost emptiness. The **Dao/Way** as a non-use that uses moves in cycles without beginning, yet its use encompasses all things. Because it is independent, it remains motionless and still, its essence complete and whole. Because it moves in cycles, it responds and communicates, its use encompassing all things thoroughly.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** exists as form yet is not form; it exists as use yet is not use. Though it does not-act, when it responds and communicates, it does not cease. Though it does not fail to act, it remains motionless and still alongside it. From its pairing and response, it is seen that it does not fail to act exhaustively, yet its ultimate return is to constant not-acting.\n\nBecause the **Dao/Way** constantly does not-act, it can do all things. Not-acting is motionless and still—the true essence of the **Dao/Way**, the so-called formless form. Not failing to act responds and communicates—the true use of the **Dao/Way**, the so-called non-use that uses. Thus it is said: *The **Dao/Way** constantly does not-act, yet does not fail to act.*\n\nIf lords and kings could uphold this,\n\nWáng Yuànzé said: A ruler embodying the **Dao/Way** to govern follows the times and aligns with principle without deliberate action, so though he does not-act, the world’s affairs are not neglected. Though the world’s affairs are not neglected, I have truly never acted. What does Heaven say?\n\nThe four seasons proceed, all things flourish—lords and kings’ **Dao/Way** exhausts Heaven’s purpose. All things will transform of their own accord.\n\n*御注*: When lords and kings uphold the **Dao/Way**, they govern the world from a realm of not-acting, and their actions emerge from not-acting, lending transformation to all things. All things transform as if by their own nature, unaware of the one who guides them—thus, it is said they transform of their own accord.\n\nShū Wáng said: Speaking of the **Dao/Way**’s essence, it is said: *All things will submit to it as guests.* Speaking of the **Dao/Way**’s transformations, it is said: *All things will transform of their own accord.* When lords and kings uphold the **Dao/Way**, they do not-act. All things transform of their own accord through the **Dao/Way**, hence it does not fail to act.\n\nZhuangzi said: *Without acting, all things transform.* When transformation is about to manifest, Shū Wáng said: *To shape transformation is called change.* Speaking of transformation about to manifest, manifesting is merely movement.\n\nWáng Yuānzé said: When transformation progresses daily, it is like an infant’s growth—sure to reach a point where wisdom and deliberation arise, and the harmony of Heaven gradually wanes. Observing the end of the Three Dynasties, where customs and morals became refined and exhausted, one can understand this.\n\nI shall govern with the nameless simplicity of the Uncarved Block.\n\nZhuān Wēi said: The **virtue/power** of the Sage’s transformation always rescues people. If there are those who do not submit to his transformation, yet cultivate sincerity in themselves and extend this cultivation universally to the world, then if lords and kings know and uphold it, will not the world’s cultivation be universal?\n\nHe who does not hoard the **Dao/Way** yet seeks to share its benevolence with the world—this is the **Dao/Way** of the lords and kings. To seek to share it with the world, one must first uphold it as lords and kings. Yet scholars, seeing only his words, speak of abandoning benevolence and righteousness, saying: *\"Laozi undermines and belittles my benevolence and righteousness; I will not accept this.\"* Alas, they do not see the intent behind the abandonment, so it is fitting they reject it.\n\nLù Xīshēng said: The first chapter establishes the **Dao/Way** as its substance, common names as its function, and culminates in the *Yet More Mysterious*. This chapter takes *not-acting* as its substance, *without-not-acting* as its function, and unifies them under *comprehensive forgetting*. Beginning and end are interconnected, exhausting its substance and function.\n\nHumans are born in stillness—this is the nature of Heaven. When stirred by things, they move—this is the nature of desire. Even the nameless simplicity of the Uncarved Block, if it does not desire, then nature remains still and corrects itself first. Thus, the world does not await correction but corrects itself naturally.\n\nLǐ Tián said: The Great **Dao/Way** takes emptiness and stillness as its true constancy, and responsive application as its subtlety. If lords and kings uphold its true constancy—remaining motionless in tranquility—and model its subtle applications, responding and thus harmonizing, then all things will transform in purity and the world will be rectified.\n\nThis chapter begins by speaking of the **Dao/Way**’s constancy in *not-acting* yet *without-not-acting*, and concludes with the *nameless simplicity of the Uncarved Block* without desire. If one harbors the desire for simplicity, it is not true *not-acting*. The *nameless simplicity of the Uncarved Block* in *comprehensive forgetting*—this is the **Dao/Way**’s constancy in *not-acting*. The world will naturally rectify itself—this is *without-not-acting*.\n\n*The Compendium of Good Selections from the Dao De Jing*, Volume Five concludes. *The Compendium of Good Selections from the Dao De Jing*, Volume Six begins.\n\nThe *Collected Writings of Master Li Lin of Rao Mountain, Song Dynasty*\n*Imperial Commentary*:\n\nThe **Dao/Way** has no fixed form, yet virtue has completeness and deficiency.\nWhen aligned with the **Dao/Way**, there is no virtue to name;\nwhen distinguished from virtue, there is a name to discern.\nRen, yi, li, and zhi—\nreceived according to measure, applied according to time—\nthis is virtue alone.\nThose who embody the **Dao/Way** differ from this,\nand thus are placed in the lower scriptures.\n\nMaster Wang Yuanze said: *Virtue* is *obtaining*.\nThings arise from the **Dao/Way**, each obtaining from it,\nand thus it is called *nature*.\nTo obtain one’s nature without losing it—\nthis is the completeness of virtue.\nVirtue has never differed from the **Dao/Way** yet possessed its own virtue,\nbut it has reached the point of self-indulgence and lost the **Dao/Way**.\n\nAs for the *True Person*, they do not cling to the reality of nature, life, virtue, and the **Dao/Way**,\nbut merge them into one.\nThough the four names respond to the world with varied titles,\nI know neither their difference nor their unity—\nthis is the profound aspect of virtue.\n\nStill, virtue is *obtaining*—\nhow could one avoid losing it?\nOnly by taking *non-obtaining* as virtue,\nand thus virtue becomes non-virtue—\nthis may be called the utmost.\n\nThis is the embodiment of the **Dao/Way**,\nnot one who possesses virtue.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Eight: The Supreme Virtue Does Not Cling to Virtue**\n\nThe supreme virtue does not cling to virtue,\nand thus has virtue.\n*Imperial Commentary*:\nThings obtain life and are called virtue.\nAll obtain in harmony, silently uniting with the **Dao/Way**,\npassing without regret, achieving without self-possession—\nthis is called *not clinging to virtue*.\n\nConfucius did not dwell on his sainthood,\nbut acted as a sage when the time demanded—\nthus he truly had virtue.\n\nMaster Wang Bi said:\nThe person of supreme virtue uses only the **Dao/Way**.\nNot clinging to virtue, without attachment or action,\nthus they truly have virtue.\n\nMaster Gu Shenzi said:\nThe supreme virtue does not cling to virtue—\nit aligns with the **Dao/Way**.\nVirtue is *obtaining*.\nTo obtain the **Dao/Way** is to say this.\nThe person of supreme virtue aligns with the **Dao/Way** without a *heart of obtaining*,\nthus their virtue is pure and tranquil.\n\nThe *Classic* says:\nThough named as obtaining the **Dao/Way**,\nin reality, there is nothing obtained.\nThe utmost ritual does not enter the self,\nthe utmost righteousness does not objectify,\nthe utmost wisdom does not scheme,\nthe utmost benevolence has no partiality—\nthis is called *not entering, not objectifying, not scheming, without partiality*—\nthis is *not clinging to virtue*.\nNot clinging to virtue—\nthis is the utmost.\nThus it is called the supreme virtue.\n\nThe *Classic* says:\nThe supreme virtue is like a valley.\n\nThe lower virtue does not lose virtue,\nand thus has no virtue.\n*Imperial Commentary*:\nRecognizing and holding onto it,\nself-indulgent and losing the **Dao/Way**—\nwhat virtue is there?\n\nMaster Cheng Xuanying said:\nNot yet reaching the utmost,\nthus called the lower.\nClinging to virtue without forgetting,\nthus called *not losing*.\n\nMaster Su Shi said:\nThe sage follows their heart’s desire without overstepping the measure.\nNot intentionally seeking virtue,\nyet virtue is naturally complete.\nThose of lesser understanding value virtue highly,\nstriving to avoid losing it—\nmerely preserving themselves,\nwhat virtue is there?\n\nMaster Gu Shenzi said:\nThe lower virtue does not lose virtue—\nvirtue is obtained.\nThe lower virtue scatters the **Dao/Way** as virtue.\nThus, limping is called benevolence,\nstumbling is called righteousness,\nfastidiousness is called ritual,\nand contrivance is called wisdom.\nThough named as not losing,\nvirtue is far from the **Dao/Way**,\nthus it has no virtue.\n\nThe supreme virtue acts without doing,\nyet does not act.\n*Imperial Commentary*:\nObtaining without thought,\nachieving without effort,\narriving without action—\nthis is the supreme virtue.\n\nEmperor Xuanzong of Tang said:\nTo know *non-acting* and thus *not act*—\nthis is not the utmost.\nTo *not act* without knowing *non-acting*—\nthis is the utmost.\n\nMaster Wang Yuanze said:\nThe supreme virtue is *non-acting*,\nyet also does not *do* anything—\nvirtue is naturally complete.\n\nMaster Cao Daochong said:\nThe highest virtue is originally *non-acting*,\nnot deliberately cultivating the thought of *non-acting*.\n\nMaster Lü Jipu said:\nThe supreme virtue is *non-acting*,\nnot intentionally so,\nbut naturally obtaining it,\nand truly doing nothing.\n\nMaster Gu Xuan said:\nSpeaking of the supreme virtue’s transformation,\nhandling *non-acting* affairs,\npracticing speechless teaching—\nits traces are not evident.\nThus it is said:\n*Non-acting* has no traces,\nthe heart has no desires—\nthus it is said *without doing*.\nThus the supreme virtue’s *non-acting*\nis not conforming to the beauty of *non-acting*,\nbut contains and nurtures pure simplicity,\nnaturally *non-acting*—\nthus it is said *without doing*—\nthis is the heart and traces both *non-acting*.\n\nThe lower virtue acts,\nand thus does something.\n\nMaster Lü Jipu said:\nThe lower virtue does not know this and acts,\nthus cannot avoid *doing*.\n\nVirtue, without *doing*, is sufficient.\nYet if there is benevolence in it,\nthen it is *doing*.\n\nThe person of lower virtue\ndoes not obtain without thought,\ndoes not arrive without action—\nthus they neither reach *non-acting*\nnor are compelled to *do*.\n\nThe supreme benevolence acts,\nyet does not *do*.\n*Imperial Commentary*:\nEmperor Yao and Shun’s nature covered the world,\nyet they did not do so for personal gain—\nthus they did not *do*.\n\nMaster He Shanggong said:\nComprehensive aid without bias,\ntheir benevolence is supreme—\nthus it is called *upper canopy*.\n*Doing* refers to the seven graces.\nAccomplishing without claiming,\ncompleting without controlling—\nno attachment to action.\n\nKing Shuzong of Shu said:\nThe seven graces are\nhaving those to love and those to cherish.\nOnly because they have those to love and cherish\ncan they not *do* without action.\nThe lower ones are known accordingly.\n\nMaster Wang Yuanze said:\nTransformation is the longest of goodness,\nanother name for virtue.\nSince it is distinguished from virtue,\nthis is *doing*.\nYet the sage’s transformation\nfulfills nature and is sufficient,\nrequiring no artificial effort—\nthus there is no *doing*.\n\nThe supreme righteousness acts,\nand thus does something.\n*Imperial Commentary*:\nArranging enemies and measuring appropriateness—\nthis is righteousness.\nTo establish the self,\nto regulate affairs—\nhow could one *not do*?\n\nEmperor Xuanzong of Tang said:\nRighteousness is to judge what is wrong—\nto say *judging what is wrong* is righteousness,\nthus it is said *acts*.\nWith something to judge what is wrong and cut through,\nordering what is appropriate—\nthus it is said *and thus does something*.\nThis is both heart and traces *doing*.\n\nThe *Miscellaneous Sayings* say:\nThe supreme virtue *does not act* yet *does not do*—\nthis is the Yellow Emperor.\n\nThe supreme virtue of *Ren* acts yet does nothing—\nthis is Yao and Shun.\nThe supreme righteousness acts and thus does something—\nthis is Tang and Wu.\n\nSupreme righteousness, inferior virtue.\n\nSomeone said: Tang and Wu were great sages—\nto call their virtue inferior, is that acceptable?\nIt was said: What sages share is the heart.\nThe reason virtue has superior and inferior is time.\nGreat sages in different times act accordingly.\n\nWhen supreme ritual acts and none respond,\nthey roll up their sleeves and press forward.\n\nYan Junping said:\nEmpty and effortless, opening the Dao for all things—\nthis is the *Dao*-person.\nSerene and responsive, doing nothing yet nothing is left undone—\nthis is the *virtue*-person.\nLoving all things broadly and giving without end—\nthis is the *Ren*-person.\nOrdering names and rectifying affairs according to what is fitting—\nthis is the *righteousness*-person.\nHumility, withdrawal, yielding words, and reverent harmony—\nthis is the *ritual*-person.\nThese five are all acceptable—\nthis is the Dao.\nBut they are traces, not the ultimate.\n\nThe ultimate transcends all five—\nhow could it encompass them all?\n\nWu Jun said:\nRitual and wisdom are the great barriers against chaos.\nVirtue and the Dao are the vast principles to soothe it.\nThus, the Dao is the root of ritual,\nand ritual is the branch of the Dao.\nHolding the root is easy and firm,\ngrasping the branch is difficult and perilous.\nTherefore, the sovereign takes the Dao as heart,\nvirtue as substance,\n*Ren* and righteousness as carriage and attire,\nritual and wisdom as crown and cap—\nthen, with hands resting, the world transforms itself.\nBut if one values ritual and wisdom while forgetting virtue and the Dao,\nit is like having fine adornment without essence—\nthough diligent day and night, the world will decay.\n\nThe *Ren*-person gives without measure.\nRighteousness chooses what to give fittingly,\nwithout demanding return.\nRitual demands reciprocity.\nTo give without receiving in return is not ritual;\nto receive without giving in return is also not ritual.\nThe principle of giving and receiving—\nwhen ritual is practiced upon another and they do not respond,\none rolls up their sleeves and, angry, presses forward in pursuit.\nRolling up one’s sleeves means baring the arm by pushing aside sleeves.\nIn the Spring and Autumn era,\na single unavenged word, a single improper bow,\ncould lead two states to violent conflict—\nyet they would still roll up their sleeves and press forward,\nfocusing on the lesser offense.\nThus, one loses the Dao and then virtue,\nloses virtue and then *Ren*,\nloses *Ren* and then righteousness,\nloses righteousness and then ritual.\nRitual is the thinnest layer of loyalty and trust,\nyet the first cause of chaos.\n\n*Imperial Commentary*:\nThe Dao cannot be attained,\nso one loses the Dao and then virtue.\nVirtue cannot be fully realized,\nso one loses virtue and then *Ren*.\n*Ren* can be practiced,\nand when practiced, approaches righteousness—\nso one loses *Ren* and then righteousness.\nRighteousness can be diminished,\nand when diminished, is adorned with ritual—\nso one loses righteousness and then ritual.\nWhen it comes to ritual, one drifts further from the Dao,\nand the losses multiply.\n\nAll things cannot flourish simultaneously—\nthis is yin and yang.\nThey take from each other—\nthis is power and virtue.\nSubstance is thick where appearance is thin—\nthis is the ritual of father and son.\nThus observed, the more elaborate the ritual,\nthe more surely substance decays.\nWhen substance decays, deceit follows,\nand strife and chaos arise.\nTherefore it is said:\nRitual is the thinnest layer of loyalty and trust,\nyet the first cause of chaos.\n\nEmperor Xuanzong of Tang said:\nTo lose the Dao is to lose supreme virtue.\nSupreme virtue aligns with the Dao, hence \"losing the Dao.\"\nThe seven stages of virtue and righteousness\nare names for the times—simple or perilous.\nThus, when the Dao declines, virtue appears;\nwhen virtue is lost, *Ren* remains;\nwhen *Ren* vanishes, righteousness arises;\nwhen righteousness is destroyed, ritual intervenes—\nthese are all adaptations to the times.\nTo discuss ritual in an age of purity is madness or heresy;\nto forget ritual in a corrupt age is folly or deceit.\nIf one can dissolve and transform,\nthey should retreat from ritual and practice righteousness,\nretreat from righteousness and practice *Ren*,\nretreat from *Ren* and practice virtue,\nforget virtue and merge with the Dao.\nWhen people return to purity,\nsupreme virtue’s non-action prevails.\n\nZuan Wei said:\nTo neglect virtue, *Ren*, righteousness, and wisdom,\nand rely solely on ritual teaching—\nis this not the thinnest layer of loyalty and trust,\nthe first cause of chaos?\nBut if one honors virtue, *Ren*, righteousness, and wisdom\nwhile also employing ritual and wisdom,\nthis is ritual elevated.\nThen where would disorder arise?\n\nLoyalty means no deceit;\ntrust means no falsehood.\nZhuangzi said:\nIn the age of supreme virtue,\nsubstance exists without knowing it as loyalty,\nappropriateness exists without knowing it as trust—\nthough loyalty and trust exist, they are unknown.\nWhen ritual is applied,\njade and silk are exchanged in swift succession,\ngiving and receiving follow in turn,\nbowing and kneeling, clasping hands—\nall are mere outward decorum.\nThe heart may not truly align.\nYet substance is pure and returns to natural joy,\ntrust is genuine and conforms to ritual propriety.\nWhen ritual and music spread everywhere,\nthe world descends into chaos.\nThe *Taishang* speaks of ritual as a deficient text—\ndwell in its depth, not its shallowness.\nReside in its substance, not its ornament.\nThus, discard the latter and take the former.\n\nLu Jifu said:\nAspire to *Ren* and righteousness,\nabandon ritual and wisdom,\nand seek the fullness of virtue and the Dao—\nthis is discarding the superficial for the substantial.\nVirtue and the Dao are thick and real;\nritual and wisdom are superficial and thin.\nThus, the true man discards the superficial ritual and wisdom,\ntaking instead the substantial virtue and Dao—\nthis is how the true man fulfills the Dao and preserves virtue.\nThis chapter speaks of the root of the Dao,\nwhile *Ren*, righteousness, ritual, and wisdom are its losses.\nSupreme virtue aligns with the Dao.\nThus, one does not retreat to virtue\nbut instead transforms righteousness and ritual,\nand seeks the substantial virtue and Dao—\nonly a true man can attain this.\n\nFormerly, in *Chapter Thirty-Nine: The Ancient Who Attained Oneness*—\n\nThe *Er Lu Tian* says:\nTo enter the One Dao is to gain it,\nto exit the One Dao is to lose it.\nThe One is the boundary between existence and nonexistence.\n\n*Liezi* says:\nThe One is the beginning of form’s transformation.\n\n\"Formerly\" (*xī*) means speaking of antiquity as if it were recent.\n\"Formerly\" refers to the time after Heaven and Earth.\n\nThe *Classic* says:\nThe Dao gives birth to the One; in things, it becomes *jing* (精).\n\nThose who attained the One in antiquity—Heaven, Earth, the divine, and all things—\nthough they differ in high and low, dark and bright,\nthe One was never unequal.\nThus, it is said: *Its attainment is the One.*\n\nThe One is the root.\nHeaven attains the One and becomes clear.\n*Gu Huān* says: Heaven is pure *yang* qi.\nAttaining the One, it is thus light and clear above.\n\nEarth attains the One and becomes tranquil.\n*Gu Huān* says: Earth is pure *yin* substance.\nAttaining the One, it is thus still and settled below.\n\nThe divine attains the One and becomes numinous.\n*He Shang Gong* says: When the divine attains the One, it can transform without form.\n*Wang Yuanze* says: \"Divine\" refers to the spirit of ghosts and gods.\n*Numinous* is the dispersion of the divine.\n\nValleys attain the One and become full.\n*Guo Xiang* says: Valleys are the hollows of rivers.\nValleys and rivers, attaining the One, thus flow with springs and streams,\nfilling ravines and gullies.\n*Wang Yuanze* says: The One, as One, pervades without limit,\nso valleys, though empty, can respond—\nthe One abides within them.\n*Lu Tian* says: The empty is the body of valleys; the full is their function.\n\nAll things attain the One and thus come to life.\n*Zhang Junxiang* says: Sentient and insentient alike—\nall things share the One Dao and thus take form.\n\nLords attain the One and become the rectification of the world.\n*Its attainment is the One.*\n\n*Commentary* says: *Zhuangzi* says: \"To harmonize with the One is to complete all things.\"\nAttaining the One means no duality;\nembracing the One means no separation;\nguarding the One means no deviation;\nknowing the One means knowing all;\nnot knowing the One means knowing nothing.\n\nThose who attained the One in antiquity!\nThey embodied the utmost *jing* of the world—\nno thing could pair with them.\nThus, they stood firm above, pure and unmixed;\nthey settled below, still and unchanging.\nThe most hidden and formless—this is the divine.\nAttaining the One, it does not grow dim.\nThe most empty and responsive—this is the valley.\nAttaining the One, it does not run dry.\nAll things transform *jing* into form, thus attaining the One to live.\nLords govern the many through singularity, thus attaining the One to rectify the world.\n\nFrom Heaven and Earth down to lords,\nthough high and low differ in rank,\ndark and bright in dispersion,\nHeaven’s clarity, Earth’s tranquility,\nand the lord’s rectification of the world—\nnone seek this externally.\nThe One alone governs it.\n\nThus it is said: *Its attainment is the One.*\n*Wang Yuanze* says: The One is undivided—\npresent in all things, yet its essence remains singular.\nNo other can achieve the One as the One itself can.\n\nThe meaning of the One—\nthe utmost *jing* of the world.\nOnly because it is *jing* can it become divine;\nonce divine, it is complete.\nYet the divine’s virtue ever abides in the One.\n\nLords govern the many through singularity,\nthus becoming the rectification of the world.\n\nThe *Classic of Change* says:\n\"The movement of the world is rectified by the One and stops.\"\n\nHeaven without clarity would fear splitting;\nEarth without tranquility would fear erupting;\nThe divine without numinosity would fear ceasing;\nValleys without fullness would fear exhaustion;\nAll things without the One would fear annihilation;\nLords without singularity would fear toppling.\n\n*Commentary* says:\nHeaven’s duty is to cover; Earth’s is to bear.\nIf split, it cannot cover; if erupted, it cannot bear.\n*Erupted* means to overflow.\nThe divine depends on humans to act—\nif it ceases, it has nothing to show.\nValleys receive but do not store—\nif exhausted, none would respond.\nWhen gathered, *jing* qi becomes things—\nthis is attaining the One to live.\nWhen scattered, wandering spirits become transformations—\nthis is losing the One to perish.\nPerishing is the cessation of life.\nOnly rectitude can govern all transformations\nand stand alone.\n\nAbove all things, there is none to rectify them,\nyet lords, though noble and high, cannot preserve themselves—\nhow could they avoid toppling?\n*Toppling* means the fall of the exalted.\n\n*Wang Yuanze* says:\nThe One, as One, is everywhere—\nto speak of its principle exhausts language.\n\nEven in human form:\nWhen a person is born, *jing* is the root;\nthe divine gathers from *jing*, and the body takes shape.\nWhen *jing* is lost, the form dies and the divine departs.\nWhether virtue or form, the principle is the same.\n\nThus, nobility depends on humility as its root,\nand height depends on lowliness as its foundation.\n\n*Commentary* says:\nThe humble is what the noble relies upon for stability;\nthe low is what the high arises from.\n\nCommon people see only the end,\nbut the sage probes the root.\nCommon people see only completion,\nbut the sage examines the subtle.\n\nThus, they ever attain the One.\n\n*Sun Deng* says:\nA nine-tiered tower begins with piled earth;\na hundred *rèn*-high height starts with a single basket.\nThis illustrates how nobility depends on lowliness as its foundation.\n\n*Wang Yuanze* says:\nWater, of the Five Phases, is numbered One,\nyet it flows downward without contention—\nthis is the nature of *yin* and *yang*.\n\nThose who know this Dao,\nthough seated in nobility and height,\ndo not forget their roots.\nThus, they are secure in their positions,\nlike preserving the divine while storing *jing*—\nthe divine ever remains.\n\nTherefore, lords call themselves *gū* (孤), *guǎ* (寡), *bùgǔ* (不谷)—\nthis is their grounding in humility, is it not?\n\n*Commentary* says:\n*Gū*, *guǎ*, and *bùgǔ* are names of lowliness,\nyet lords use them as titles—\nthey know their roots.\nThis is how lords, though noble and high, do not topple.\n\n*Gu Huān* says:\n*Gū* is the name for the fatherless.\n*Guǎ* is the name for the bereaved.\n\n「Not谷 (*bùgǔ*) is the term for the unvirtuous.\nIt refers to those who are not the central focus of all things and thus cannot unify the multitude’s praise.\n\nAll three of these names—*gū*, *guǎ*, and *bùgǔ*—\nare what people hold in disdain,\nyet lords and kings take them as their own titles—\nis this not the very meaning of grounding in lowliness?\n\nThe term *bùgǔ* is one of careful inquiry,\nstating that lords and kings label themselves *gū*, *guǎ*, and *bùgǔ*\nto make clear their foundation in lowliness.\n\n*Wang Yuanze* says:\nOne, though numerically the least,\nis the root of all things.\nThus, knowing that the foundation lies in lowliness,\none understands that true nobility arises from embracing lowliness.\n\nTherefore, he attains *shù* (数) and *yù* (舆),\nyet finds no *yù* (舆).\n*Commentary* says:\nThose who exalt themselves to dominate others,\nwho claim nobility while degrading others,\nyet fail to uphold their foundation in gentleness—\nwhite without knowing to guard with black—\nif they seek praise through such excess,\nthen hollow praise gathers violently,\nwhile baseless slander follows swiftly,\nand thus they attain no true praise.\n\n*Tang Ming Huang* notes:\nThe character *shù* (数) is pronounced with an ascending tone,\nwhile *yù* (誉) is pronounced as *yùzi* (舆子).\n\n*Say* explains:\nWhen *shù* (数) and *yù* (舆) are attained,\nthere is no *yù* (舆) left—\nthe axle is the foundation of the wheel.\nWhen *shù* (数) and nobility are attained,\nthere is no true nobility—\nlowliness is the root of nobility.\nThe axle is the foundation of the wheel,\nso one must preserve the axle to stabilize the wheel.\nLowliness is the root of nobility,\nso one must uphold lowliness to secure nobility.\nThus, this passage warns lords and kings to take lowliness as their foundation,\nand so it speaks of attaining *shù* (数) and *yù* (舆).\n\n*Wang Yuanze* says:\nThe character *shù* (数) is pronounced with an entering tone,\nwhile *yù* (舆) is the character for *yù* (誉, praise).\n\n*Say* explains:\nThose who grasp the One\nuse lowliness as their foundation,\nyet internally conceal the utmost nobility—\nthe world cannot attain them,\nand they do not seek to be attained by the world.\nIf lowliness is truly their own,\nand they govern with praise and reputation,\nis this truly praise?\n\nThey do not wish to be polished like jade,\nnor rugged like stone.\n*Commentary* says:\nJade is noble, while stone is lowly,\nyet both are fixed and unchanging.\nThe Sage adapts to the times and follows the natural order,\nunhindered in all transformations.\nThough the myriad changes are without constancy,\nmy heart remains ever One—\nthis is the true grasp of the One.\nThus, one cannot be attained in terms of nobility or lowliness.\n\n*Mencius* said:\nWhat I dislike about those who cling to the One\nis that they cling to the One while abandoning the hundred.\nThey do not wish to be polished like jade,\nnor rugged like stone—\nthis is not merely knowing the transformations;\neven the Sage cannot surpass it.\nThis is what is called *shàngdé* (上德, highest virtue).\n\n*Héshàng Gōng* (河上公) says:\n*Lìnglìng* (琭琭) is a metaphor for scarcity,\n*luòluò* (落落) is a metaphor for abundance.\nJade is scarce, hence it appears noble.\nStone is abundant, hence it appears lowly.\nThe saying does not wish to be like jade,\nto be held in others’ esteem,\nnor like stone,\nto be held in others’ contempt.\nOne must dwell in the balance between them.\n\n*Wang Yuanze* says:\nJade and stone are firm and unyielding,\nfixed and unable to bend or change—\nthis is not the One.\nBut if one embraces the myriad transformations while remaining ever One,\nthen this is the true One.\nThus, jade is polished and noble,\nyet cannot be lowly.\nStone is rugged and lowly,\nyet cannot be noble.\n*Lǎo Shì* (老氏, Laozi) having illuminated the One’s meaning,\nfeared that some might grasp the One as unchanging,\nrigid like jade or stone,\nand thus lose the true essence of the One.\n\nOnly those who embody the One\nare both noble and lowly—\ntheir virtue is like water,\nadapting to square, round, crooked, or straight,\nendlessly responding to all things,\nyet never departing from the One.\nThus, they cannot be attained in terms of nobility or lowliness,\nfor the One transcends all nobility and lowliness.\nThis passage’s meaning is the most profound and difficult to express;\nnow I merely outline its core principles.\n\nThe Dao gives birth to the One,\nand the One is the completeness of virtue.\nWhen embodied in things,\nit approaches the Dao.\nThis chapter takes the One as its central theme.\n\nThe One is the utmost refinement of the world.\nHeaven, Earth, gods, and things—\nnoble or lowly, moving or still, growing or decaying—\nall derive from the One to achieve their forms.\nThe *Tàishàng* (太上) fears that people will cling to the One\nwithout understanding transformation,\nand so concludes with *bùyù* (不欲, \"do not wish\"),\nfor those who are rigid like jade or stone\nlose the true meaning of the One.\n\nI humbly believe that the *Tàishàng*’s Dao\nbegins with refining *jīng* (精, essence) as its foundation,\nthen perfecting the *shén* (神, spirit) as its wondrous Way.\nIf the foundation is not established,\nthen the Dao has no means to arise,\nso the One is taken as the foundation,\njust as essence is refined to perfect the spirit.\n\nIt concludes with jade and stone,\nfearing that people will cling to refining essence\nwithout nurturing the spirit.\nEven if their lifespan equals that of tortoise and crane,\nthey will never hope to attain the Dao of immortality.\nOnly when both essence and spirit are refined\nand harmonized with the Dao\nis this the true attainment.\n\n*End of Volume Six of the Collected Virtues of the Dao/De True Classic*\n*End of Volume Seven of the Collected Virtues of the Dao/De True Classic*\n\n---\n\n**Volume Eight of the Collected Virtues of the Dao/De True Classic**\n\n**Chapter Forty: The Dao’s Movement Lies in Reversal**\n\nReversal is the Dao’s movement.\nWang Yuanze said: *\"To return to the origin is to be still; only stillness can give rise to movement—*\n*just as autumn and winter give rise to spring and summer.\"*\n\nSu Ziyou said: *\"Reversal is restoration; to restore one’s nature is to be still.*\n*Yet though it remains motionless and tranquil,*\n*it responds and thus communicates with all things under Heaven—*\n*this is how movement originates from stillness.*\n\n*Gazing upward at Heaven,*\n*the four seasons unfold,*\n*withdrawing and storing in winter,*\n*and flourishing and renewing in spring.*\n*Looking downward at Earth,*\n*the Five Phases have water,*\n*which reverses its flow to complete the One,*\n*and thus moves beneficially with the times.*\n*The Dao of Heaven and Earth lies in reversal,*\n*so they endure eternally.*\n*Once a person receives their formed body,*\n*they abandon its nature,*\n*like a vessel among myriad things,*\n*never reversing throughout their life—*\n*alas, the sorrow of it.*\n\n**Chapter Forty-One: The Weakness of the Dao**\n\nThe weak are the Dao’s instrument.\nShu Wang said: *\"The Dao’s instrument lies in weakness,*\n*for it is empty.*\n*Consider Heaven—*\n*even when it points to me, it also overcomes me,*\n*and when it overcomes me, it also points to me.*\n*Thus, the wind moving through the boundless void*\n*may be called weak.*\n*Yet nothing fails to be stirred by it,*\n*no form fails to be swept by it—*\n*so the wind’s power lies in its weakness.*\n*Consider Earth—*\n*when guided to the east, it flows east,*\n*when guided to the west, it flows west.*\n*Thus, water entrusted to the depths of the void*\n*may be called weak.*\n*Yet it dwells where all others abhor,*\n*and assaults the firm and strong,*\n*none can surpass it—*\n*so water’s power lies in its weakness.\"*\n\nHe further said: *\"Reversal is not the means by which movement arises,*\n*yet there is what is called movement—*\n*movement arises from reversal.*\n*Weakness is not the means by which strength arises,*\n*yet there is what is called strength—*\n*for weakness can give rise to strength.*\n*Though it speaks of reversal without mentioning stillness,*\n*speaks of weakness without mentioning strength,*\n*when it speaks of movement, one knows reversal is stillness,*\n*and when it speaks of weakness, one knows its use is strength.*\n*All things under Heaven are born from existence,*\n*existence from non-existence—*\n*and it is just so with this.*\n\n*Weakness overcoming strength,*\n*the Dao’s wondrous use—*\n*as water, the weakest,*\n*can assault the firm and strong.*\n*All things under Heaven are born from existence,*\n*existence from non-existence.*\n*He Shang Gong said:*\n*‘All things arise from Heaven and Earth,*\n*Heaven and Earth have form and position,*\n*thus they are said to be born from existence.’*\n*‘The divine luminosity of Heaven and Earth all arise from the Dao,*\n*the Dao has no form,*\n*thus it is said to be born from non-existence.’*\n*Lu Jipu said:*\n*‘Only existence can give birth to all things under Heaven,*\n*yet non-existence can also give birth to all things of existence—*\n*thus the Dao’s movement lies in reversal,*\n*and its use in weakness is known.’*\n*So then, to seek reversal and weakness is no other thing,*\n*but to perfect the One and reach the utmost of non-existence.*\n\n*The meaning of this chapter:*\n*To return to the origin and be still,*\n*then movement will not be lost.*\n*As Zhuangzi said:*\n*‘Stillness gives rise to movement,*\n*movement attains its purpose.’*\n*The Dao’s use is never not beneficial,*\n*so without contention, it can overcome strength—*\n*as the Classic says:*\n*‘The weak overcome the strong.’*\n*So then, to seek reversal and weakness is no other thing,*\n*but to perfect the One and reach the utmost of non-existence.*\n\n**Chapter Forty-One: The Superior Person Hears the Dao**\n\nThe superior person hears the Dao\nand diligently practices it.\n*[Commentary:] A person of virtue who aspires to the Dao.*\n\nThe superior person hears the Dao,\nwith true virtue accumulating strength over time,\nand utmost sincerity ceasing not.\nLi Rong said: *\"The more one believes in the Dao,*\n*the more resolute one’s practice becomes.*\n*Changing seasons do not alter their resolve,*\n*melting gold and stone cannot move their conduct.*\n*Firm from beginning to end,*\n*steadfast without artifice—*\n*this is the superior person’s movement in practice.\"*\n\nThe term *‘superior’* (上) refers to the highest rank.\nThe term *‘person’* (士) refers to one who takes the Dao as their calling.\nThe superior person, having attained enlightenment,\nhears this wondrous Dao.\nThe more they believe in the Dao,\nthe more resolute their practice becomes.\nPractice and reality correspond,\nwhether appearing or withdrawing,\nwhether acting or dwelling,\nalways relying on reality without separation.\nTrue enlightenment grows with every thought,\nthe cultivation of the heart never falters—\nthus it is called *‘movement in practice.’*\n\n*A question arises:*\n*The Dao cannot be heard,*\n*yet if one hears it, it is false—*\n*how then does the superior person hear it?*\n*An answer is given:*\n*‘To hear with the ears and practice with the heart,*\n*this is true hearing.’*\n*Confucius said:*\n*‘To hear the Dao in the morning,*\n*and die in the evening,*\n*that is enough.’*\n\nThe middle person hears the Dao\nas if it exists and yet does not exist.\nShu Wang said: *\"The middle person knows the Dao as beautiful,*\n*yet does not know what constitutes the Dao.*\n*Knowing the Dao as beautiful,*\n*they hear it like the great sound*\n*that does not enter the vulgar ear.\"*\n\nLi Rong said: *\"Unspun silk does not resist change,*\n*yet follows the shifting hues of black and yellow.*\n*The middle person is undetermined,*\n*their heart shifts with their likes and dislikes.*\n*If they hear the true Dao for preserving life and stabilizing the realm,*\n*they cherish the Dao and forget the world.*\n*If they see wealth, beauty, or sensual pleasures,*\n*they delight in their nature to gratify their desires—*\n*then they cherish the world and forget the Dao.*\n*The middle person can ascend or descend,*\n*yet they harbor doubt in their heart.*\n*Doubt arises, and their resolve is divided,*\n*so though they hear the Dao,*\n*they govern their body to prolong life,*\n*and govern the realm to achieve great peace,*\n*they rejoice and yet cling to it.*\n*When they retreat and see wealth, beauty, or honor,*\n*they may again forget it in their emotions and desires—*\n*then they cannot move and practice it.*\n*One moment they emerge,*\n*one moment they withdraw—*\n*like Zi Xia, who emerged to see the bustling splendor,*\n*the dazzling beauty, and delighted in it,*\n*yet hearing the Master’s Dao,*\n*he took joy in that instead.\"*\n\nThe inferior person hears the Dao\nand laughs loudly at it.\nWang Yuanze said: *\"The Dao is vast, resembling what is not like,*\n*unrecognized by shallow vision—*\n*thus they laugh.*\n*Indeed, as the following text says:*\n*‘How could the vulgar ever perceive it?’*\nZhi Cong said: *\"The inferior person hears of this wondrous Dao,*\n*formless, nameless,*\n*neither coming nor going,*\n*neither born nor extinguished—*\n*not believing in it,*\n*they instead rebel against it,*\n*so they clap their hands and laugh loudly,*\n*calling it empty and false.*\n*The inferior person is born with lowly nature,*\n*indulging their emotions and many desires,*\n*their wisdom insufficient to discern,*\n*their understanding insufficient to know.*\n*They admire beauty with their eyes,*\n*desire to hear sounds with their ears,*\n*crave to taste flavors with their mouths,*\n*and their spirit longs to be fulfilled—*\n*if they do not obtain it,*\n*they fall into great anxiety and fear.\"*\n\nThe Dao/Way is without sound, color, taste, or flavor that can be obtained,\nthen its distance from what the ears, eyes, nose, and mouth crave is far indeed.\n\nHearing the Dao of tranquil stillness, desolate emptiness, and effortless non-action,\nthey laugh and reject it.\nNot to laugh is not enough to be the Dao/Way.\n\nYang Fu said:\nThe lowly and ignorant are muddled,\nvaluing the superficial while despising substance.\nThe Dao/Way is profound and mysterious,\nempty and distant.\nIf it is not scorned by shallow understanding,\nit is not worthy of the utmost profundity.\n\nSu Ziyou said:\nThe Dao/Way cannot be seen without form,\nnor heard without sound.\nIf one does not first know the futility of all things,\nthen, unobstructed and insightful,\nthey may still be prone to disbelief.\nThus, the inferior person hears of the Dao/Way\nand calls it absurd and extravagant, laughing at it.\n\nThe middle person hears of the Dao/Way,\nand though they associate with its rise and fall,\nthey doubt it.\n\nOnly those who clearly perceive it\nthen act and embrace it without hesitation.\n\nConfucius said:\n*\"Speak to them of the Dao/Way, and they do not grow weary—*\n*that is my disciple Zilu.\"*\n\nThis is what is called the superior person.\n\nTo live with the common while opposing the Dao/Way—\n*the \"Classic\" says:*\n*\"Few know me, and thus I am precious.\"*\n\n**Commentary on the passage:**\n*Jiàn* means \"to establish.\"\n*Here, establishing words of the Dao/Way—*\n*this refers to the following text.*\n\nShu Wang said:\nConfucius once remarked:\n*\"Lost in confusion, yet not awakening.\"*\nI liken this to our Old Master [Laozi].\nIndeed, the Old Master praised the ancient speakers of the Dao/Way,\nfor the ancients had these three sayings,\nso he merely spoke of their confusion.\n\n**Clarifying the Dao/Way as if in darkness,**\n*the Imperial Commentary says:*\n*\"Like the sun’s light illuminating the lowlands—*\n*that is clarity.*\n*Abundant wisdom yet not displayed,*\n*borrowing its radiance without flashing,*\n*thus it appears as darkness.\"*\n\nWang Yuanzhe said:\nGreat clarity seems obscure.\n\nZhi Cong said:\nInner wisdom is clarity,\nouter non-display is darkness.\n\n**Advancing the Dao/Way seems like retreat,**\nLi Rong said:\nHearing the Dao/Way and diligently practicing it—\nthis is advancing toward great achievement,\nyet lacking is retreat.\n\nLü Jifu said:\nTo cultivate the Dao/Way is called \"subtracting\" (损).\nSubtracting again and again,\nuntil one reaches effortless non-action—\nthis is what is called advancing the Dao/Way as retreat.\n\n**Leveling the Dao/Way as if uneven,**\nLi Rong said:\nTo smooth and equal all things—\nthis is leveling the Dao/Way.\nTo blend with the world like dust and light—\nthis is being uneven.\n\nEmperor Ming Huang of the Tang said:\n*Leveling (夷)* means \"smoothing.\"\n*Uneven (颣)* refers to the irregular threads of silk.\nIndeed, one who knows the mind’s clarity and stillness,\nwhere desires and dust do not arise,\nis naturally smooth and easy,\nboundless with all things,\nyet outwardly appears like silk with uneven threads.\n\nDu Guangting said:\nThe enlightened person cultivates themselves—\ninternally, they are smooth and level,\nexternally, they blend with the world.\nEnduring hardship while meeting joy,\nadapting to the times—\nlike silk with uneven threads.\n\nThe Dao/Way is singularly unified,\nyet things are infinitely diverse.\nThose who embody the Dao/Way,\ninternally are smooth and level,\nfixed and unchanging,\nexternally adapt to all things,\nshifting with their transformations—\nthus, they appear uneven.\n\n**Superior virtue is like a valley,**\n*the Imperial Commentary says:*\n*\"A valley is empty yet receptive,*\n*receptive yet does not accumulate.*\n*Empty yet responsive,*\n*responsive yet inexhaustible.\"*\n\nLu Tian said:\nThe utmost emptiness supplies all demands,\nthe utmost void responds to all feelings—\nthus, it is called superior virtue like a valley.\n\n**Great whiteness seems like disgrace,**\nLi Rong said:\nPure yet not tainted—\nthis is great whiteness.\nMingling with filth—\nthis is disgrace.\n\nLu Tian said:\nKnowing whiteness yet guarding against blackness,\nknowing honor yet guarding against disgrace—\nthus, it is called great whiteness as disgrace.\n\nThe truly pure and white,\ninternally harbor clarity and stillness,\nclearly manifest and refined,\nwashing away all stains—\nthis is great whiteness.\nHiding their light, blending with the world,\ndwelling where the crowd reviles—\nthis is disgrace.\n\n**Ample virtue seems insufficient,**\nSun Deng said:\nIf virtue is deep and broad,\nthen the distant and shallow are seen as trifling,\nand minor details are overlooked—\nlike wisdom and knowledge being insufficient.\nThus, a skilled merchant hides their wealth as if they had none.\nA person of great virtue,\nthough their appearance seems foolish—\nthis is ample virtue appearing insufficient.\n\nZhi Cong said:\nIndeed, superior virtue accomplishes the ten directions,\nadorns all things,\nits transformation boundless—\nthis is called \"ample.\"\nThough it is said to have virtue,\nyet it appears as if without virtue—\nthis is truly without virtue,\nhence, it is called insufficient.\n\n**Establishing virtue seems like theft,**\nEmperor Ming Huang of the Tang said:\n*Jiàn* means \"to establish.\"\n*Theft (偷)* means \"to steal.\"\nSpeaking of establishing hidden virtue,\nsecretly cultivating and acting—\nlike a thief, always fearing discovery,\nthus it is called seeming like theft.\n\nChe Huibì said:\nThe Sage establishes all virtues,\nsaves all beings,\nwondrously employing hidden and flowing functions,\nunnoticed by others—\nthus, it is called seeming like theft.\n\nThese two interpretations speak of theft as *stealing*.\n\nSu Ziyou said:\nTo follow things’ natural course without imposing—\nexternally, it seems like laziness and theft,\nyet truly, it is establishing.\n\nWang Yuanzhe said:\n*Theft (偷)* means \"hasty and careless.\"\nSmall-minded, seeking quick results,\nstriving to establish something—\nhow could this suffice as virtue?\nOnly those who follow the seasons and act according to principle,\nappearing as if lazy and careless,\ntruly establish the great virtue.\n\nZhuangzi said:\n*\"Acting only when there is no alternative.\"*\n\nThese two interpretations speak of theft as *laziness and carelessness*.\n\n**True substance seems to change,**\nWang Yuanzhe said:\nEmbodying nature and holding onto the spirit,\nwandering among the world’s affairs—\nendlessly adapting to the world,\nyet their Dao/Way remains constant,\nso none know its true substance.\nThat ancient recluse of the Han dynasty,\nYin Zhang, steadfastly held to his true nature,\nyet differed from the world,\nstartling Zigong’s disciples,\nwhile the Sage saw him as a false cultivator of chaos—\ncould this be called true substance?\n\nSu Ziyou said:\nEmbodying nature and holding onto the spirit,\nadapting to things’ transformations,\nyet never losing their true essence—\nexternally, it seems to change.\n*Substance (质)* refers to inherent nature,\n*true (真)* to pure unity,\n*change (渝)* to shifting colors.\nSpeaking of the Dao/Way’s practitioner,\ntrue in nature and pure without falsity,\nyet appearing to change,\nlike waves blending with all things.\n\n**The boundless has no corners,**\n*the Imperial Commentary says:*\n*\"The boundless is the Dao/Way without boundaries—*\n*boundless yet not dividing,*\n*thus it has no corners.\"*\n\nLi Rong said:\nThe universe is vast and has form—\nthus, it has boundaries.\n\nThe Dao/Way’s ultimate reaches formlessness—\nthus, it has no corners.\n\nLǚ Jìfǔ said:\nThe boundless form encompasses no south, no north,\nyet unfolds in four directions,\nplunging into the unfathomable.\nNo east, no west—\nit originates in the Mysterious Void,\nreturns to the Great Communion—\nthis is the boundless’s lack of corners.\n\nWáng Yuānzé said:\nThe boundless is the Dao/Way’s essence.\nIf it had four corners,\nits form would be confined to what is seen—\nits smallness would be long past.\n\n**Great vessels take time to mature.**\n*Imperial Commentary says:*\nThe great vessel is the vessel that is not a vessel.\nNeither aiding birth nor assisting growth,\nthus it matures late.\n\nTáo Hóngjìng said:\nAccumulating virtue, the Dao/Way is fulfilled—\nthis is called a great vessel.\nNot achieved in a single day,\nhence, it matures late.\n\nLù Dìan said:\nIn conduct, its pace is slow yet unceasing—\nthus, it is said: *Great vessels take time to mature.*\nThe great vessel is the vessel of the Dharma-body.\nThe Dharma-body’s great vessel is realized through accumulated merit,\nnot in a single morning or evening—\nthus, it matures late.\n\nZhuāngzi said:\nPerfection lies in duration.\n\n**Great sound is rare in voice.**\n*Imperial Commentary says:*\nIts motion is boundless, yet response follows—\nthus, it is rare in voice.\n\nWáng Bì said:\nTo hear without hearing is called rare—\na sound that cannot be heard.\nIf there is voice, there is division;\nif there is division, it is neither *gōng* nor *shāng*.\nDivision cannot harmonize all things,\nso one with voice is not great sound.\n\nZhì Cóng said:\nRare in voice is like having no voice.\nThe Sage’s single teaching pervades the ten directions,\nopening the dense and enlightening the vulgar,\nthough teaching fills the ten directions—\nthis is called constant stillness.\nTeaching is no teaching,\nspeaking is no speaking—\nby this meaning, it is called rare in voice.\n\n*Commentary says:*\nThe Dao/Way responds to all sounds—\nthis is great sound.\nTo listen without hearing—\nthis is rare in voice.\n\n**Great images are formless.**\nZhōng Huì said:\nWithout images, it does not respond—\nthis is called great image.\nSince it lacks substance and form,\nhow could it have shape or description?\nThe great image is the image of no image.\nSince the image has no image,\nhow could it have form or shape?\n\nThe Dao/Way is hidden, nameless.\nZhuǎn Wēi said:\nThe Dao/Way originally has no name,\nyet it is forcibly named *Dao*.\nNow the Dao/Way is hidden within it—\nwhat name could there be?\nThis is truly what is called *erasing traces and concealing origins*.\n\nLǚ Jìfǔ said:\nAll these are the Dao/Way.\nYet calling it clear yet obscure,\nlevel yet uneven,\nadvancing yet retreating—\nto the point of sound being rare in voice,\nimages being formless,\nnames and reality constantly opposing—\nsince the Dao/Way is hidden in the nameless,\nand it is named with names,\nit is constantly as if opposed.\n\nOnly the Dao/Way\nis both generous and fulfilled.\n\nGù Huān said:\nGiving before receiving is called generous;\nthings obtaining the Dao/Way is called fulfilled.\nWhen fulfilled, it returns to the Dao/Way—\nthe Dao/Way obtains it.\n\nZhì Cóng said:\nNow, the few who are born are born by the Dao/Way.\nGenerous, you should awaken—\nreturning to the Dao/Way, why cling to life as life\nand not return to the root?\n\nShū Wáng said:\nThe truly generous is what all things rely upon without depletion.\nYet it returns to its origin—\nthus, it is fulfilled.\n\nThis chapter speaks of the Dao/Way’s profound subtlety,\nits hidden depth and difficulty to perceive.\nFrom the *Illuminated Dao* to the *Great Image*, all are the Dao/Way.\nThe Dao/Way’s marvel cannot be sought by intellect,\ncannot be pursued by form—\nit can truly be called hidden.\nThe Dao/Way’s essence is hidden in the nameless,\nyet its function is both generous and fulfilled.\nThe superior person awakens to this and diligently practices;\nthe inferior hears of it and thus laughs greatly—\ntruly, as the chapter says,\nhow could the common crowd recognize it?\n\n**Chapter 42: The Dao/Way Generates One**\nThe Dao/Way generates One,\nOne generates Two,\nOne generates Three,\nThree generates the ten thousand things.\n\nLù Dìan said:\nThe Dao/Way generates One—this is the Supreme Ultimate.\nOne generates Two—this is yin and yang.\nTwo generates Three—this is the *chōng* qi.\nWith yin and yang, and the *chōng* qi between them,\nthen the ten thousand things are born.\nThus, it is said: *Three generates the ten thousand things.*\n\nLǐ Róng said:\nOne generates Two—clear and turbid separate, yin and yang manifest.\nTwo generates Three—cycling the two qi, forming the Three Powers.\nThree generates the ten thousand things—\nthe round heaven covers above,\nthe square earth bears below,\nand the Sage rules between—\nwhat thing does not generate?\n\nGǔshénzǐ said:\nThe Great Dao/Way is natural,\ntransforming to generate spirit,\nspirit moves to form harmony,\nharmony disperses to condense qi,\nqi condenses to form shape—\nthus, it is said:\n*The Dao/Way generates One,\nOne generates Two,\nTwo generates Three,\nThree generates the ten thousand things.*\nOne is the beginning of form’s transformation.\nThe light and clear become heaven,\nthe heavy and turbid become earth,\nthe harmonious *chōng* qi becomes humankind.\nThus, heaven and earth contain essence,\nand the ten thousand things transform and generate.\n\nThe ten thousand things bear yin and embrace yang,\nHéshànggōng said:\nThe ten thousand things without fail bear yin and turn toward yang,\nretreating inward yet seeking the sun.\nThe *chōng* qi harmonizes them.\n\nLù Dìan said:\nThe Daoists call it *chōng* qi;\nmedical scholars call it stomach qi.\nWith yin and yang, then stomach qi arises within.\nBear means *back*;\nembrace means *face*.\n*Chōng* means *central*.\nAll that is dark and unfathomable is yin;\nall that is bright and visible is yang.\nAll that lives must turn its back to the dark\nand face the bright.\nYet the ten thousand things cannot generate alone with yang,\ncannot form alone with yin—\nthey must have the central harmony of yin and yang,\nthen things generate.\nAs Zhuāngzi said:\nExtreme yang is blazing,\nextreme yin is solemn—\nsolemn arises from heaven,\nblazing issues from earth.\nThe two intermingle to form harmony,\nand thus things generate.\n\nWhat people detest—\nthe terms *gū* (orphan), *guǎ* (widow), *bùgǔ* (barren)—\nkings and dukes adopt as titles.\n\nZhuǎn Wēi said:\n*Gū*, *guǎ*, and *bùgǔ* are terms of softness, weakness, and humility—\nwhat the vulgar detest and avoid.\nYet it is the noble Sage and great person who thus refers to themselves,\nand by this attains the nobility of kings and dukes.\n\nThis law is the harmony of *chōngqì* (penetrating qi), diminishing the overbearing strength of the will while seeking to augment virtue and Dao.\n\nThe terms *gū* (orphan), *guǎ* (widow), and *bùgǔ* (barren)—\nthese are the lesser evils.\nKings and dukes, occupying the highest stations,\nadopt what people detest as their own titles,\ndwelling in humility, conforming to softness and weakness,\nto align with the harmony of yin and yang.\n\nThus it is said:\nThings may be diminished to gain benefit,\nor augmented to suffer loss.\n\nLi Róng said:\nTo hold wealth and nobility yet call oneself *gū*, *guǎ*, or *bùgǔ*—this is diminution.\nRenewing virtue with daily humility—this is augmentation.\nTo occupy high station without virtue is self-augmentation;\ntalent unmatched by rank invites ruin—this is diminution.\n\nThe *Commentary* states:\n*\"Gu\"* is a continuation of the preceding argument.\nWhen kings and dukes name themselves *gū*, *guǎ*, or *bùgǔ* in self-abnegation,\nthe people rejoice in honoring and serving them—this is augmentation through diminution.\nOr, when augmentation leads to loss:\nIf kings and dukes, in their exalted station, grow arrogant,\nthe people scatter and withdraw—this is diminution through augmentation.\n\nAs the *Yijing* says:\n*\"Fullness invites loss; humility invites benefit.\"*\nThus it is spoken.\n\nShū Wáng said:\nThe Dao of Heaven diminishes excess and augments humility.\nOnly by augmenting humility can one truly diminish—\nfor what is diminished becomes the source of benefit.\nOnly by diminishing excess can what is augmented become the source of loss.\nThus, the titles kings and dukes adopt\nare the means to attain benefit while dwelling in high station.\n\nWhat people teach,\nI also teach as my doctrine.\n\nHé Shànggōng said:\nWhat the masses teach is to discard weakness for strength,\nto discard softness for rigidity.\nI teach the masses to discard strength for weakness,\nto discard rigidity for softness.\nWhat people teach others,\nthey should teach with my doctrine of softness and weakness.\n\nThe overbearing perish without proper death.\nHé Shànggōng said:\nThe overbearing are those who reject the Mysterious and Profound,\nwho defy virtue and Dao, who disregard teachings,\nand rely on power and force.\nTo not die a proper death means to be cut off by Heaven,\nslain by blades, executed by law—\nnot to die a natural death in full years.\n\nYán Xiān said:\nStrong Qin perished through tyranny,\nGreat Han flourished through harmony.\nThe overbearing lose the Way,\nthe rigid lose the numinous.\nOnce the vital principle withdraws,\nhow can they endure?\n\nThe *Explanation of Characters* says:\nThe beams of a house rest on sturdy supports—\nthus the name *liáng* (beam).\nOf all things, none are stronger than beams.\nThe \"overbearing\" are like beams in strength.\nThe strong among men are but companions of early death.\n\nZǐlù loved valor yet died untimely.\nYì excelled in archery, yet drowned in a boat—\nboth perished without proper death.\nYet these were all failures of the doctrine of softness and weakness.\nI shall take this as my teaching for fathers.\n\nLi Róng said:\nTo disobey one’s parents and rulers,\nto defy the teachings of the sages,\nto hoard glory while clinging to victory,\nto exalt oneself over others—\nthis is overbearing.\nTo violate laws, to meet untimely death in mid-life,\nto not die a proper death—\nthis is the fate of the overbearing.\n\nAll things conform to the Dao;\nthe sage never fails to teach.\nHuman nature, straying from reason, is the origin of speech.\nThrough the splendor of benevolence and righteousness,\nthe reality of virtue and Dao is revealed.\nFrom the nature of overbearing strength,\nthe method of softness and weakness is expounded.\n\nThis chapter speaks of how the Dao generates *yīqì* (unity-qi),\nhow *yīqì* generates yin and yang,\nhow yin and yang generate *chōngqì* (penetrating qi).\nThings obtain *chōngqì* to achieve harmony.\nThe qi of penetrating harmony is the essence of softness and weakness.\nKings and dukes, conforming to softness and weakness,\nadopt *gū*, *guǎ*, and *bùgǔ* as titles—\nthis is diminution yielding benefit.\nThe masses, favoring overbearing strength, do not die proper deaths—\nthis is augmentation yielding loss.\nThe great sage expounds this as his teaching for fathers.\nTruly, it is so.\n\n**Chapter 43: The Supreme Softness of the World**\nThe world’s supreme softness\ngallops across the world’s supreme firmness.\n\n**Li Rong said:**\nThe supreme softness among things with form—water.\nThe supreme softness without form—Dao.\nWater, though supremely soft, can dissolve gold and pierce stone,\nshatter the firm and the strong.\nDao, though supremely soft, can abandon all and forget self,\nshatter this stubborn fixation.\n\nIf one reflects upon it like water,\nembodies it like Dao,\none can penetrate the self and the other,\ntraverse hills and mountains—\nsubtle, mysterious, and boundless,\nwithout obstruction or hindrance.\nThis is called galloping across the supreme firmness.\n\nThe supreme softness is water.\nThe supreme firmness is metal and stone.\nWater can penetrate the firm and enter the hard,\npassing through all without obstruction.\nWater, being supremely soft, nearly attains Dao.\nHow much more so the formless!\n\nThe supreme softness of Dao\nenvelops heaven and earth,\npenetrates all things—\nthis is how softness overcomes hardness.\n\n\"Galloping\" means penetrating and flowing freely.\n\n*The Classic* says:\nNothing is softer or weaker than water,\nyet nothing surpasses it in attacking the firm and strong.\nIt enters without gap—\n*Riverbank Master* said: \"Without gap\" refers to Dao.\nDao has no form or substance,\nthus it enters and exits without obstruction,\ncommuning with the divine and benefiting all beings.\n\n*Yan Zun* said:\nFormed things cannot pierce sharpness,\nbut the formless divine dwells within—\nentering without openings, exiting without traces,\nin the blink of an eye, traversing thousands of miles.\n\"Without gap\" is the divine.\n\nThe divine’s work—\nits utility in entering and exiting—\nleaves no trace,\npiercing metal, penetrating stone,\nentering without gap.\nThe divine resides in the heart,\nthe heart harbors the divine.\nEmpty the heart to preserve the divine,\npreserve the divine to seek the ultimate.\nStraightforward, it pushes forward;\ncurved, it yields.\nIn all directions—up, down, left, right—\nit rests where it will,\nendless in coming and going,\ncirculating through the boundless void,\nascending to the heavens, descending to the earth,\nsixfold passage, fourfold opening—\nnowhere it enters without finding its own way.\n\nThus I know the benefit of *wuwei*.\n\n*Imperial Commentary*:\nSoftness overcoming hardness,\nthe void embracing the having—\nthe marvelous function of Dao lies here.\nAbandoning affairs, the form does not labor;\nforgetting life, the essence does not diminish—\nthis is how it is beneficial.\n\n*Wang Bi* said:\nSoftness and weakness, emptiness and void—\nnothing they cannot penetrate.\nThe supremely soft cannot be bent,\nthe void cannot be exhausted—\nthus, by extension, one knows the benefit of *wuwei*’s Dao.\n\n*Li Rong* said:\nDao is formless, yet things obtain life;\nthe sage acts without doing, yet people are transformed—\nthis is the benefit of *wuwei*.\n\nSoftness is the root of Dao,\nthe void is its function—\nthe supremely soft and void is Dao.\nDao acts without doing, yet all things transform—\nthus one knows the benefit of *wuwei*’s Dao.\n\nThe teaching of the unsaid,\nthe benefit of *wuwei*—\nfew in the world attain it.\n\n*Imperial Commentary*:\nThe teaching of the unsaid is set by the divine,\nthe benefit of *wuwei* does not deplete the true.\nThe sage embraces simplicity,\nand the world submits as a guest.\n*Wuwei* yet all things transform—\nthus those who attain it are few.\n\n*Gu Huan* said:\nFollowing Dao without words, yet customs shift—\nthus it is called the teaching of the unsaid.\nFollowing Dao without doing, yet people and things transform—\nthus it is called the benefit of *wuwei*.\nThis chapter speaks of Dao’s softness, weakness, and void,\nacting through the unsaid to teach,\n*wuwei* to transform the people.\nThose who attain this Dao in the world—\nare they not few?\n\n**Chapter 44: Name and Body**\n\nName and body—\nwhich is more intimate?\nBody and wealth—\nwhich is more abundant?\n\n*Imperial Commentary*:\nIf both arms weigh heavier than the world,\nthen name and body—\nwhich is more intimate?\nLife is not merely as precious as the pearl of Huai—\nthen body and wealth—\nwhich is more abundant?\nThe most desired name is within me—\nit is not intimate.\nThe most abundant wealth is within me—\nit is not abundant.\nOnly those who fail to discern intimacy and distance,\nabundance and scarcity,\nruin life and harm nature,\nsacrificing the body for it—\nlike Boyi starving to death for name beneath Chief Yang’s hill,\nor Zhi the robber dying for gain at Dongling’s peak—\nis this not delusion?\n\n*Li Rong* said:\nThe body is the foundation for cultivating Dao—\nthus it is intimate.\nFame is a hollow convention—\nthus it is distant.\nPeople cannot sacrifice the body for name;\nthey only sacrifice the body for name.\n\n*Wang Bi* said:\nTo prize name and seek loftiness—\none’s body will be distant.\nTo covet wealth without satisfaction—\none’s body will be diminished.\n\n*Lu Jifu* said:\nThe resolve of the virtuous is for name—\nyet to ruin life and harm nature,\nthey do not know the body’s intimacy to name.\nThus it is said: Name and body—\nwhich is more intimate?\nThe resolve of the greedy is for wealth—\nyet to ruin life and harm nature,\nthey do not know the body’s abundance over wealth.\nThus it is said: Body and wealth—\nwhich is more abundant?\nName is empty fame.\nWealth is material goods.\nThe body is the foundation for cultivating Dao—\nhow could it not be more intimate than name,\nmore abundant than wealth?\n\nFame brings danger to the body—\nMeng Zhang declined the Chu chancellor,\npreferring to be a tortoise dragging its tail.\nThe Celestial Master refused the official post,\nwishing only to learn the Dao of Huangdi.\nThus it is known: the body is intimate, name is distant.\n\nGain and loss—\nwhich causes greater harm?\n\n*Zuan Wei* said:\nThis elucidates the two sentences above.\nEmpty fame and fleeting gain—\nobtaining them is as light as a feather.\nLife, nature, form, and spirit—\nlosing them is as heavy as Tai Mountain.\nThe enlightened weigh them—\nwhich causes greater harm?\n\n*Li Rong* said:\nName is external praise.\nWealth is worldly goods.\nThe body, when loyal and filial,\nor when cultivating the ultimate Dao—\nif weakened by loss, it does not return;\nif pursued by desire, it loses its true nature.\nTo sacrifice the body for name,\nto harm oneself for wealth—\nthe deluded are many.\nThe sage inquires carefully:\nBetween gaining name and wealth,\nand losing the body—\nwhich causes greater harm?\n\n*Lu Jifu* said:\nIf one’s resolve is for name,\nthe world calls them a *junzi*.\nIf one’s resolve is for wealth,\nthe world calls them a *xiaoren*.\nThough their resolves differ,\nlosing what they cherish is the same.\nThen to gain name and wealth\nwhile losing what is essential—\nthey do not know that loss is worse than gain.\n\nThus it is said:\nWhich is more harmful—gain or loss?\n\nTherefore, the more one loves, the greater the expenditure.\nThe more one hoards, the greater the loss.\n\nEmperor Xuanzong of Tang said:\nTo love name excessively is to exhaust one’s spirit—is this not great expenditure?\nTo hoard wealth excessively is to burden oneself—is this not great loss?\n\nLiu Jinxi said:\nInsatiable greed is called excessive love.\nExcessive desire harms the body, hence it is called great expenditure.\n\nLu Jifu said:\nTo love name is to desire wealth and noble status for oneself.\nBecause of this excessive love, one loses even the finest virtues—this is great expenditure.\nTo hoard wealth is to desire riches for oneself.\nBecause of this excessive accumulation, one loses even the greatest riches—this is great loss.\n\nKnowing contentment brings no disgrace.\nKnowing when to stop brings no peril.\nThus one may endure and live long.\n\nEmperor Xuanzong of Tang said:\nDisgrace is loss and burden.\nPeril is danger and ruin.\nTo shun fame is to know contentment.\nTo refrain from amassing wealth is to know when to stop.\nKnowing contentment, one’s name matches reality without excess burden.\nKnowing when to stop, one does not hoard wealth without the harm of greed.\nWithout disgrace or peril, one may endure and live long.\n\nLi Rong said:\nNot seeking name through external means is to avoid disgrace.\nNot pursuing wealth against reason is to avoid peril.\nTo distance oneself from name and profit is to distance oneself from peril.\nThus, governing a state may endure, and cultivating oneself may last long.\n\nLu Jifu said:\nOnly those with virtue know the true nobility within themselves and need no external name.\nThus, knowing contentment brings no disgrace.\nOnly those with true wealth know the abundance within themselves and need no external riches.\nThus, knowing when to stop brings no peril.\nWithout disgrace or peril, one may endure long.\n\nThis chapter’s intent is that those who seek longevity must first abandon profit and forget fame.\nIf name and profit are not discarded, body and mind are enslaved—\nnot only does this obstruct the Dao,\nbut in time, it will harm the body.\nThus, ancient masters of the Dao\ndid not seek fame,\ndid not amass wealth.\nThough they held high office or vast emoluments,\nthey discarded them like worn-out shoes,\nviewed them as passing clouds.\nSome took joy in coarse rice and water,\nothers dwelled in humble huts.\nMinisters of state could not recognize them,\nemperors could not command them as subjects.\nThey lived in forests and caves,\nate pine shoots and drank from streams.\nWould they harm the true essence of life\nfor the fleeting illusions of fame and wealth?\nThis is the utmost warning for Daoist practice,\nthe essential duty of self-cultivation.\nThus, ancient examples are cited—\nthose who seek the Dao must cast off these shackles.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Five: Great Fullness as if Deficient**\n\nGreat fullness as if deficient—\nits use is unexhausted.\n\n*Official Commentary:*\nWithin the realm, there are four great principles, and the Dao occupies one.\nTo embody the Dao fully is why it may be called \"great.\"\nWithout completion or deficiency, this is called \"great fullness.\"\nNot having its fullness, it is as if deficient.\nUnderstanding transformation and adaptation,\nyet not clinging to fixed forms,\nits use is unexhausted.\nThis is how Confucius gathered the great teachings and became the Sage of his time.\n\nRiver Master Hu said:\nThis refers to a ruler of great virtue and fullness,\nas if deficient—\nerasing his name, concealing his reputation,\nlike a broken vessel lacking completeness.\nIf one’s mind is thus, there is no time of exhaustion.\n\n*Zuanwei* said:\nDeficient means broken.\nExhausted means ruin and defeat.\nGreat fullness refers to a person of complete virtue.\nOne whose virtue fills within\ncan embrace chaos and contain filth.\nThough their form may be fragmented,\nlike a vessel with cracks and stains,\nrarely is their use seen—\nthus they preserve their completeness\nand avoid the ruin of exhaustion.\n\nThose who achieve success are deficient in it.\nThose who achieve success but do not dwell on it\nthus do not abandon it.\nThose who achieve fame gather it,\nbut if they do not cling to empty reputation,\ntheir fame does not fade.\nThe Perfect One sees the forms of completion and decay,\nthus abandons success and fame,\nand returns to the common way.\nTheir Dao is great and full,\nyet ever as if deficient.\n\nEmperor Yao achieved success yet saw himself as deficient—\nthus he became the greatest of the Five Emperors.\nConfucius gathered the great teachings yet did not dwell on his sainthood—\nthus he became the teacher of all ages.\nHis use grows ever newer, never exhausted—\nhow could it be worn out?\n\n**Great Fullness as if Empty**\n\nIts use is inexhaustible.\n\n*Official Commentary:*\nFilling all without boundary,\nsurpassing all things—this is great fullness.\nEmpty to respond to all things,\nsimple yet effective—\nthus its application is boundless,\nits use inexhaustible.\n\nA wise merchant hides his goods deep,\nyet appears empty and virtuous,\nhis demeanor as if foolish.\n\nLu Jifu said:\nAll things are measured from it yet it is never depleted—this is fullness.\nYet when added to, it does not increase—\nthus it is as if empty.\nOnly because it is as if empty\nis its use ever renewed and inexhaustible.\n\nLuosha said:\nWisdom without accumulation is called fullness.\nEmpty yet upright—this is called \"empty.\"\nSpeaking of those who are greatly full,\nthey forget their fullness,\nthough full, they appear empty—\nempty, they are not depleted.\nIf their use is thus,\nthen it has no end.\n\nThe moon wanes when full,\nthe satisfied mind is diminished.\nThe Perfect One knows the cycles of fullness and emptiness,\nyet though full, remains as if empty.\n\n**Great Straightness as if Bent**\n\nWang Bi said:\nTo follow things in straightness—\nstraightness does not lie within oneself—\nthus it appears bent.\n\nLuosha said:\nUpright in principle, without deviation—this is straightness.\nTo conform to things in bending—this is bent.\nThe body may be bent,\nbut the Dao cannot be bent.\nGreat straightness is bending the self to extend the Dao.\n\nGoulu Hui was dismissed three times for his straight path yet did not leave.\n\n**Great Skill as if Clumsy**\n\nSu Shi said:\nSkill without clumsiness\nwould labor in its skill—\nto entrust to natural spontaneity,\nthough clumsy, is skillful.\n\nLiu Jinxi said:\nThe artisan shapes ten thousand things,\nthe furnace refines all life—\nthough possessing great skill and function,\nthey forget their labor,\nhide their traces like the common,\nthus it is called clumsy.\nSkill lies in what is not done,\nletting nature form things.\nWithout artificial crafting, there is no skillful function—\nto give form to things, square or round,\nstraight or curved—\ntheir subtlety is unseen,\nthus it appears clumsy.\nTo carve and refine all forms yet not claim skill—\nis this not the proof?\n\n**The Great Skill as if Clumsy**\n\nThere is the craftsmanship of Qi Qing’s chiseling the furnace, not like the Song artisan carving mulberry wood.\n\n**Great Eloquence as if Tongue-Tied**\n\n*Commentary:* Silent eloquence is called great eloquence.\nHuizi’s many arguments were indeed small.\n\nLuo Shi said:\nTo encompass all wisdom is great eloquence—\nspeaking only what is lawful, hence called tongue-tied.\n\nSu Shi said:\nEloquence without tongue-tied speech\nwould surely exhaust itself.\nSpeaking in accordance with principle,\nthough tongue-tied, is eloquent.\n\n**Hot and Cold, Stillness and Motion**\n\nHot overcomes cold,\nstillness overcomes heat—\nclearing and tranquil is the norm for all under Heaven.\n\nLü Jifu said:\nCold and heat are the workings of Heaven and Earth,\ninevitable for all things with form.\nYet one moment of agitation can overcome cold,\none moment of stillness can overcome heat—\nif a single instance of agitation or stillness\ncan prevail over Heaven and Earth’s operations,\nhow much more so the embodied stillness of non-action,\nwhich establishes the norm for all under Heaven?\nThis chapter first speaks of the great virtues,\nconcluding with clearing and tranquil as the norm for all under Heaven.\n\nThe Old Master said:\nThose who attain enlightenment in the Dao\nare always clearing and tranquil.\nThose who enlighten to the Dao\nmust be still, must be clear—\nonly in emptiness can one attain\nthe above great virtues.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Six: When the World is Governed by the Dao**\n\nWhen the world is governed by the Dao,\nwarhorses are driven back to manure fields.\n\n*Commentary:* When rulers govern by the Dao,\nthe people take joy in their occupations and do not contend—\nthey merely manure their fields.\n\n\"Governed by the Dao\" refers to a ruler who follows the Way.\n\"Driven back\" means to withdraw.\n\"Warhorses\" are steeds that gallop.\n\"Manure\" means to fertilize fields.\nIt speaks of a ruler who governs the world with the Dao—\ncontent with little, knowing sufficiency,\nseeking nothing from beyond,\nnot employing arms or martial arts,\nabandoning warfare and cultivating culture,\nwith no battles or pursuits—\nonly tending to the fundamental occupations,\nthus withdrawing the galloping steeds\nto till the fields.\n\nFor those cultivating the self,\nthe mind-horse does not gallop,\nand the elixir field fills naturally.\n\nWhen the world is without the Dao,\nwarhorses breed in the suburbs.\n\nWen Gong said:\nInsatiable greed, internal strife, external contention.\nA ruler without the Dao\nindulges in desires, seizes without restraint,\nwages war endlessly—\nthus warhorses, bred in the suburbs,\nremain there for long without return.\n\n\"Suburbs\" refers to the outskirts of a city.\nThe restless and competitive\ncannot know contentment and sufficiency,\nthus they ride their steeds recklessly,\ngalloping through the suburbs of sensual pleasures.\n\n**No greater crime than desiring what is desirable.**\n\n*Commentary:* If one does not see what is desirable,\nthe mind remains undisturbed.\nWhen people’s desires reach the point of endangering life and nature,\ncrime arises from this.\n\nEmperor Xuanzong of Tang said:\nWhen the mind perceives what is desirable,\nthat is the greatest crime.\n\nZhang Junxiang said:\nWhen the external scene is beautiful,\nthe mind calls it \"desirable\"—\nthus it is said.\nYet if the scene can adapt to the mind,\nit becomes the cause of crime.\nIf the cause persists without end,\ngreat crime will surely follow.\n\n**No greater calamity than not knowing sufficiency.**\n\n*Commentary:* Moderation brings fortune,\nexcess brings calamity.\nKnowing sufficiency brings no disgrace—\nwhat calamity could there be?\n\nWang Yuanzhe said:\nEndless external seeking,\nlosing one’s nature and inviting calamity.\nNot recognizing the sufficiency of one’s natural endowment,\nyet consuming external things—\nthis leads to suffering and humiliation,\nwandering through life and death,\nforever sinking in the sea of filth,\neternally losing the true Dao.\nNo greater calamity exists than this.\n\n**No greater fault than desiring to obtain.**\n\nDa Meng said:\nSeeking what is already sufficient,\nyet still desiring more—\nthe heart, having no bounds,\nwill inevitably invite great fault.\n\nThis speaks of those without the Dao,\nindulging their nature and emotions,\nthus inviting retribution.\nAccumulating evil without end,\nthey burden both life and death,\ntheir punishment confined to themselves—\na crime passed to their descendants,\na fault extending to their ancestors.\n\nZuan Wei said:\nFault is retribution.\nAll things that pass before the eyes\nstill have limits.\nYet those without the Dao,\nseeing or unseen,\ndesire all things,\ndemanding they all belong to them without remainder—\nthis is the extreme of those without the Dao.\nNot only does calamity befall oneself,\nbut retribution and fault extend to future generations.\n\nCrime refers to violating prohibitions—\nthe first offense is called crime,\nthe Daoist practice of repentance.\nThe *Classic* says:\nThe first offense is crime, also called fault.\nFault means error.\nEighteen hundred offenses become calamity,\nwhich is heavier than crime.\nTwo thousand one hundred sixty offenses become fault,\nwhich is heavier than calamity.\nThese three—crime, calamity, fault—\nare the deeds of those without the Dao.\n\nAll things, seen or unseen,\nthat one desires must be obtained—\ndesiring and obtaining is what invites fault.\nSelf-inflicted disaster is crime,\ndefying the divine brings calamity,\ndefying others brings fault.\nFrom desiring what is desirable\nto not knowing sufficiency,\nnot knowing sufficiency leads to desiring to obtain.\nCrime leads to calamity,\ncalamity leads to fault,\nand fault brings disaster from the multitude.\n\nNo greater crime than calamity,\nno greater calamity than fault—\nthis is the natural order.\n\nThus, sufficiency in knowing sufficiency\nis always sufficient.\n\n*Commentary:* When people see what is desirable,\nthey do not know sufficiency;\nnot knowing sufficiency leads to desiring to obtain;\ndesiring to obtain stirs contention and brings chaos.\nThus, when the world is governed by the Dao,\nwarhorses are driven back to manure fields.\nYet if one knows sufficiency\nand each finds contentment in their nature and life,\napplying neither cleverness nor skill—\nmerely fulfilling daily needs in eating and drinking,\nwhat contention or chaos could there be?\n\nKing Shū of Chu said:\nMòzǐ said:\n\"It is not that there is no place to reside,\nbut that my heart lacks sufficiency.\nIt is not that there is no wealth,\nbut that my heart lacks sufficiency.\nAll things naturally reach sufficiency,\nyet there are those who say they lack—\nbecause their hearts lack sufficiency.\"\nThose who attain the Dao know their hearts and wealth are sufficient,\nthus it is said:\n\"Sufficiency in knowing sufficiency\nis always sufficient.\"\n\nWang Yuanzhe said:\nEach fulfills their natural endowment—\nwhat lack could there be?\n\nThis chapter speaks of governing the world with the Dao:\ninternally knowing sufficiency,\nexternally seeking nothing—\nthus ending contention and war,\navoiding calamity and fault.\n\n**玉诀类**\n\nCultivating the self means few desires and knowing sufficiency—\nthe mind’s wild steed unbridled no more,\nthe elixir field guarded within—\nthen one may be called a man of the Dao.\n\n*Excerpt from the True Classic of Dao and Virtue, Volume Seven of the Collected Goodness of the Song Dynasty*\n*Collected by Resident Master Li Lin of Raoyang*\n*Chapter Forty-Seventh: Not Leaving the Door*\n\nNot leaving the door, one knows the world.\nNot peering through the window, one sees the Dao of Heaven.\n\nWang Huibian said:\nThe traveler, with an empty heart and inner stillness,\ndoes not let the mind gallop through the world’s affairs,\nnor does he labor in grasping at external things.\nWith true discernment of falsehood,\nall matters become thoroughly known.\n\nLu Tian said:\nAll things are already complete within me.\nThere is the Dao of Heaven, the Dao of Earth, the Dao of Man.\nIf one turns inward to seek them without being deceived by the external,\nthen the Dao of Man can be known without leaving the door,\nand the Dao of Heaven can be seen without peering through the window.\n\nThough the world be vast, the sage knows it through the Dao.\nThough the Dao of Heaven be distant, the sage sees it with the heart.\nWhen heart and Dao align,\nand one observes the world through the Dao,\nthere is nothing distant that cannot be discerned—\nthus, no need to leave the door.\nWhen one sees the Dao of Heaven with the heart,\nthere is no height it cannot reach—\nthus, no need to peer through the window.\n\nYang Zi said:\nHow wondrous is the human heart!\nWhen held, it exists; when released, it vanishes.\nWho but the sage can constantly hold and preserve it?\nThe sage preserves the spirit to its utmost,\nharmonizing with the juncture of Heaven and Man,\nmaking them unbroken.\nThe farther one goes, the less one knows.\n\nCai Zi Huang said:\nThose without the Dao cannot examine themselves or know others.\nTheir minds race after external phenomena—\nthough they leave the door and travel far,\nor peer through windows to gaze at stars,\ntheir knowledge and perception remain scant,\nfor they abandon themselves to seek without.\n\nLü Jifu said:\nThe world is vast, indeed boundless—\nif one waits to leave before knowing it,\nthen the reach of one’s strength is limited,\nand how much can one truly know?\nThe Dao of Heaven is distant, indeed unfathomable—\nif one waits to peer before seeing it,\nthen the reach of one’s sight is limited,\nand how much can one truly see?\nThus it is said:\n*The farther one goes, the less one knows.*\n\nWang Yuanzhe said:\nThe boundless principle is exhausted in a single mote of dust.\nNo subtle thought arises, all entanglements manifest.\nIs not this where the study of the Dao lies?\nYet some seek it afar—how blind they are!\nThe farther one goes, the less one knows—\nis this not so?\n\nThus the sage acts without going, knows without seeing,\naccomplishes without doing.\n\n*Commentary:*\nTo know the world with one’s wisdom is called *knowing without going*.\nTo see the Dao of Heaven with one’s heart is called *seeing without peering*.\nTo know without going, to see without peering—\nwhat need is there for action?\nYet lofty indeed is their accomplishment—\nthis is called *accomplishing without doing*.\nTheir knowledge is divine in discerning human affairs—\nEmperor Yao and Shun knew the world could be known.\nThen the vastness of Heaven and its unity—\nYao and Shun saw the Dao of Heaven could be known.\nTo know without going, to see without peering—\nwhat need is there for action?\nOnly to rectify oneself and face south—\nthus it is said: *accomplishing without doing*.\nThis chapter speaks of the Dao itself—\nthere is the Dao of Heaven, the Dao of Man.\nThough Heaven and Man differ, their Dao communicates.\nThe sage aligns heart with Dao,\nand though the world be vast,\nit can be known without leaving the door.\nThough the Dao of Heaven be distant,\nit can be seen without peering through the window.\nTo know without going, to see without peering,\nto accomplish without doing.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Eighth: Daily Increase for Learning, Daily Decrease for the Dao**\n\n*Commentary:*\nLearning seeks to attain the Dao—\nbeginning as a scholar, ending as a sage.\nDaily increase accumulates within oneself.\nConfucius said to Yan Yuan:\n*\"I see his progress—\nthe seeker of the Dao discards limbs and senses,\nabandons form and intelligence,\nand all affairs dissolve into forgetfulness—\nthus it is called *decrease*.\"*\n\nLian Boyu thus lived sixty years and transformed sixty times.\nThose who cultivate the True begin as scholars seeking the Dao,\nand end as sages who have attained it.\nWhile striving in learning to exhaust principles,\nand examining all things to seek harmony,\nit is called *increase*.\nFor the Dao, one exhausts nature and reaches supreme emptiness—\nall things are known to be false,\nand though one does not intend to decrease,\nall that was gradually fades away.\n\nFirst speaking of the learner—\nif one does not learn, one cannot clearly see goodness,\nnor firmly believe in the Dao,\nand thus cannot govern it.\nHaving attained the Dao, one must abandon learning—\nif one does not abandon learning,\nthen the more one hears and sees, the more one drowns in excess,\nand the heart cannot embody the Dao—\nthus later speaking of *daily decrease for the Dao*.\n\nThus it is said:\n*Beginning with learning to attain the Dao,*\n*ending with attaining the Dao to abandon learning—*\n*then one is a fully true man.*\n\nDecrease again, and again decrease,\nuntil reaching *wuwei* [non-action].\n\nCheng Xuanying said:\nThe learner clings to desires.\nThe man of the Dao lingers in *wuwei*.\nThough shallow and deep differ,\nboth are forms of stagnation.\nNow to dispel these two fixations,\nthere is the text of *double decrease*—\nfirst to decrease the *having*,\nthen to decrease the *non-having*—\nboth extremes of learning and Dao are cast aside,\nneither *having* nor *non-having*—\nthis is the single accord.\n\nShu Wang said:\nTo exhaust principles and fulfill nature,\none must return to the original command.\nThus *decrease again, and again decrease*,\nuntil reaching *wuwei*—\nthis is returning to the command.\nYet the command is not hastily restored—\none must first exhaust and then restore,\nonly then reaching the command—\nthus it is said:\n*Decrease again, and again decrease*,\nuntil reaching *wuwei*.\n\nLü Jifu said:\nTo decrease is still to engage in action.\nTo decrease even the act of decreasing,\nonly then reaching *wuwei*—\n*wuwei* yet nothing remains undone.\n\nLuó Shì said:\nTo decrease is to have no surplus to discard,\nto discard until reaching forgetfulness of evil.\n\nThen there is nothing so slight that it is not removed,\nuntil the act of removal reaches the forgetting of good.\n\nEvil is not; good is.\nHaving already diminished the \"not,\" one must also diminish the \"is,\"\nthus it is said: *Decrease again, and again decrease.*\n\nWhen both \"is\" and \"not\" are forgotten,\nand passions are severed,\nvirtue and Dao unite—\nreaching *wuwei*.\n\nThough one’s own actions are *wuwei*,\none lets all things act of their own accord—\nthus nothing remains undone.\n\nWang Bi said:\nTo act is to lose something;\nthus *wuwei* is to lose nothing.\n\nLü Jifu said:\nThe \"non-having\" is merely the absence of having;\nthe \"not undone\" is the means by which one transcends non-having—\nthis is called *Absolute Learning, No Worry*.\n\nThe scholar accumulates what they lack;\nthe Daoist diminishes what they possess.\nTo diminish is to diminish what one possesses,\nyet even this act of diminishing retains a diminishing mind.\nOnly when one diminishes even this mind\ndoes one reach *wuwei*.\n\nSilent and unmoving,\nyet nothing remains undone—\nresponding and thus harmonizing with the Way of all things.\n\nThe *Classic* says:\n*The Dao acts without doing yet nothing remains undone.*\n\nTo govern the world,\none must act without action.\nLiu Zhongping said:\nConfucius praised Yao, saying:\n*\"Broad and boundless—people cannot name it.\"*\nHe praised Shun, saying:\n*\"He ruled without action;*\n*his rule reached such heights*\n*that the people said he acted naturally.\"*\n\nIf one does not act without action\nto govern the world,\nhow could one attain this?\n\n*Wuwei* is the true Dao.\nThe Sage embodies the true Dao.\nThe world returns to his embrace—\nthis is how *wuwei* governs the world.\nWhen one acts with affairs,\nit is insufficient to govern the world.\n\n*Commentary*:\nThe world is a great thing.\nOne who possesses great things\ncannot treat all things as things\nwithout being treated as a thing—\nthus they can treat all things as things.\nTherefore, to govern the world,\none must act without action.\n\nThe world is a divine instrument—\nit cannot be forced.\nThose who force it ruin it;\nthose who grasp it lose it.\nThus, when one acts with affairs,\nit is insufficient to govern the world.\n\nThe Sage embodies the Dao\nand governs with its truth.\nWhen the Emperor arises,\nthe King emerges,\nresponding in harmony—\nthe world will naturally submit.\n\nThe Duke of Zhou and Confucius\nleft their homelands\nand established their states beneath the Qishan peaks.\n\nTang Minghuang said:\nTo act with affairs is to labor;\nlabor leads to decay—\nthus it is insufficient to govern the world.\n\nThis chapter begins by saying:\nThe scholar seeks to attain the Dao.\nTo attain the Dao is to forget the mind,\nthus *decrease again, and again decrease*,\nuntil reaching *wuwei* and *wuwei*.\n\n*Wuwei* is the constant Dao;\n*wuwei* is the true Dao—\nthis is how one governs the world.\n\nThe *Western Ascension Classic* says:\n*Wuwei and wuwei—*\n*the state is prosperous, the people are rich.*\n\n**Chapter 49: The Sage Has No Fixed Mind**\n\nThe Sage has no fixed mind,\ntaking the people’s mind as their own.\n\n*Commentary*:\nThe Sage’s mind is the illumination of all things.\nEmpty yet receptive,\nstill yet responsive—\nlike a mirror reflecting forms,\nadapting to beauty and ugliness;\nlike a valley echoing sounds,\nresponding to loud and soft.\nHow could there be any fixed mind?\n\nObserving all things reveals their nature;\nfollowing the people is all—\nthis is called taking the people’s mind as one’s own.\n\nZhuangzi said:\n*\"The people are lowly—*\n*one cannot but follow them.\"*\n\nLiu Jinxi said:\nThe people are the collective term for all.\nYet the Sage, having no mind,\nresponds when touched—\nresponses follow things as they are touched—\nthus they take the people’s mind as their own.\n\nHaving no mind to respond,\nyet nothing remains unresponded to.\n\nThe good, I treat as good;\nthe ungood, I also treat as good—\nvirtue is good.\nThe trustworthy, I trust;\nthe untrustworthy, I also trust—\nvirtue is trust.\n\n*Commentary*:\nGood and evil contradict each other;\ntruth and falsehood mock each other—\nthese are the common sentiments of the world,\nself-made distinctions.\nHow could this be virtue?\n\nVirtue as good means seeing all actions as good,\nso even the ungood is treated as good.\nVirtue as trust means seeing all emotions as trustworthy,\nso even the untrustworthy is treated as trustworthy.\n\nTrue and false are both forgotten,\nright and wrong are unified—\nthis is called the person of perfect virtue.\n\nWang Yuanzhe said:\nGood and evil arise from delusion;\ndelusion arises from self-interest.\nIf one is impartial to the Great Dao,\neven when seeing good and evil with one’s eyes,\nthe mind holds no differing thoughts.\nThus the Sage, following the world’s sentiments,\nartificially establishes praise and blame,\nyet knows that good and evil are originally not opposed—\nnot out of pity or tolerance,\nbut because one unconsciously sees no difference.\n\nTo forget the reality of good and evil is true goodness.\nThus all phenomena, though differing,\nare equal in their true nature.\nTrust and distrust arise from self-interest.\nKnowing all appearances are delusion,\none sees the ungood as good;\nknowing all appearances are real,\none sees the untrustworthy as trustworthy.\n\nWhen delusion is known as reality,\nand reality is known as delusion—\nthis is how the Sage’s wisdom differs from the common people.\n\nThe Sage moves among the people,\never vigilant,\nharmonizing their heart with the world.\n\n*Commentary*:\nWhen in the world,\nthe Sage shares in the people’s joys and sorrows—\nthough having no fixed mind,\none cannot but be cautious.\nThus, for oneself, one is ever vigilant,\nnever at ease;\nfor the world, one unifies good and evil,\nforgets truth and falsehood,\nand closes the door to praise—\nharmonized, and that is all.\n\nCai Zixiang said:\nWith teaching that has no distinctions,\none blends hearts that have distinctions.\nSince people have good and ungood,\ntrust and distrust,\nand make dual distinctions,\nthe Sage appears to all as good and trustworthy—\nultimately, all is unified in mystery,\nthus it is said: *harmonized*.\n\nWang Yuanzhe said:\n*Vigilant* means fearful.\nThe people fix their ears and eyes on the Sage;\nthe Sage treats them like children.\n\nWang Yuanzhe said:\nLooking up to emulate them,\nthe ignorant people’s every move is illogical.\nThe Sage pities and guides them,\nlike parents to an infant—\ngentle and accommodating to their nature,\nwithout anger or resentment.\nWho but one who embodies the Dao,\nforgets things,\nand is as vast as Heaven and Earth,\ncould do this?\n\nThis chapter speaks of the Sage embodying the Dao without thought,\nthus forgetting good and evil,\nequalizing trust and distrust,\nand when in the world, vigilant yet never daring to stray.\nAs for governing the world,\nthe Sage simply blends all and that is all.\n\nThe people look up and follow them,\nheeding only the Sage’s vision and hearing.\nWhen the Sage meets them,\ntreats them with kindness and generosity,\neven those who are not good or trustworthy\nbecome so—\nthis is the way of nurturing them like children.\n\nOut of ten people,\nthree are those who preserve life,\nthree are those who hasten death,\nand three, though desiring life,\nunwittingly rush toward death.\nThose who preserve life\ndo so by indulging in life to excess,\nwhile those who hasten death\ndo so by clinging to emptiness and neglecting the body.\n\nThe ten who rush toward death\nare those who move in perilous ways—\nthe gallows loom before them,\nprisons stare them in the face.\nAll these forget that the body is their greatest affliction,\nthat life is limited,\nyet cling to it too heavily.\nThe ancient ones who attained the Dao\nneither let wealth and honor harm their bodies\nnor let poverty and humiliation burden their forms.\nThey do not rejoice in longevity,\nnor lament in early death.\nThey awaken in solitude,\nand thus can transcend time\nand enter the realm of neither death nor life.\n\nThe *Classic* says:\nPeople who lightly regard death\ndo so because their attachment to life is too great—\nthus they lightly rush toward death.\nOnly those who do not cling to life\nare wiser than those who value it.\n\nFor those who excel in preserving life,\nRiver Master said:\n*\"Preserving\"* means nurturing.\nZhuangzi did not speak of preserving life himself,\nbut said *\"those who hear\"*—\na humble phrase.\n*\"Preserving\"* also means guarding.\nWithin guarding life, one grasps its subtle essence,\nthus it is said: *those who excel in preserving life*.\n\nThey walk on land but do not meet rhinoceros or tigers,\nenter armies but are not struck by weapons.\nRiver Master said:\nWalking on land yet not meeting rhinoceros or tigers,\nnaturally avoids harm, not engaging with it.\nEntering armies yet not struck by weapons,\ndoes not delight in killing others through war.\n\nChen Xuanjing said:\nThis shows the three poisons cannot harm them—\nif one preserves life without clinging to life,\nharm cannot harm.\nSince they have no internal three poisons,\nexternal three poisons cannot harm them,\nthus they walk on land yet do not meet rhinoceros or tigers,\nenter armies yet are not struck by weapons.\n\nWhy?\nFor tigers embody anger,\nrhinoceroses embody delusion,\nweapons embody greed.\nThe rhinoceros has no place to thrust its horn,\nthe tiger no place to set its claws,\nthe weapons no place to lodge their blades.\n\nShu Wang said:\nOnly those who excel in preserving life\ncan be without self.\nWithout self, they do no harm to others,\nand others cannot harm them.\n\nZhuangzi said:\nIf a person can empty themselves and wander through the world,\nwho could harm them?\nWhy?\nBecause they have no deathly realm.\n\n「Wang Yuanzé said:\nThose who have no deathly realm do so because they have no realm of birth.\nFor those without birth, they are ever serene and alive,\nyet do not cling to their own life—\nthus they never die, nor do they ever truly live.\nWhen the Dao reaches this state,\neven though their form may have *meditation* (禅),\ntheir spirit never alters—\nhow could death come to them?\nThis is the sacred and divine of the Central Realm,\nand the Buddha of the Western Land.\n\nIf one were to change and fluctuate without constancy,\nwater and fire could not scorch or drench them,\naxes and saws could not wound or sicken them.\nThey ride the void yet touch the solid,\nand go where none can pass—\nthen desires of the world cannot grasp them,\nhow much more could they harm?\n\nSomeone said:\nThen why call them *preserving life* (摄生)?\nThey replied:\nDescend one degree from this,\nand you enter the realm of birth-and-death.\nAll who preserve life must reach this state first,\nthen life remains ever constant.\nThis is akin to the profound virtue of those who contain *virtue/power* (德).\nWen Gong said:\nThe rhinoceros and tiger are metaphors for the strong and violent.\nThose who dwell among the strong and violent yet suffer no harm\ndo so because they are gentle, weak, and do not contend.\n\nLuo Shi said:\n*Realm* (地) is akin to *birth* (生).\nBecause they preserve life without clinging to birth,\nthe three poisons cannot harm them.\nThis chapter speaks of the Dao of life-and-death,\nexpressed in ten words,\neach containing three meanings within.\n\nOnly those who excel in preserving life\nhave the Dao unified in one,\ntranscending these three categories—\neven rhinoceroses, tigers, swords, and armies\ndare not harm them,\nthus it is said they have no deathly realm.\n\n**Chapter 51: The Dao Gives Birth (道生之)**\nThe Dao gives birth to them,\n*Virtue/Power* (德) nurtures them,\nthings take form,\nand circumstances complete them.\n\n*Commentary*: Once form and substance are complete,\nthe body and its circumstances are established—\nthe relative shapes of long and short,\nhigh and low, are thus determined.\nLu Jiufu said:\nThe birth of all things\nis always rooted in the *nameless* (无名),\nwhile their nurturing lies in the *one* yet unformed (一而未形),\nat the moment when things begin to take shape.\nThe *nameless* is the Dao,\nthe *one* yet unformed, which allows things to be born, is *Virtue/Power* (德).\nWhen they become things,\nthey are merely forms—\nnot the means by which they were born and nurtured.\nOnce forms are manifest,\nthe naked must remain naked,\nthose with scales, shells, feathers, or fur must remain so,\nand the young, the mature, the old, and the dying\ncannot escape their respective stages—\nall these are the inevitable consequences of circumstances.\nThus it is said:\n*The Dao gives birth to them,\nVirtue/Power nurtures them,\nthings take form,\nand circumstances complete them.*\n\nThe Dao gives birth to spirit,\nVirtue/Power distributes *qi* (气),\nand through its flowing motion, it gives rise to things—\nwhen things are born and their nature established, that is *form* (形).\nThus all things reverence the Dao\nand honor Virtue/Power.\n\nLu Jiufu said:\nCircumstances arise from form,\nform arises from Virtue/Power,\nand Virtue/Power arises from the Dao.\nThe Dao and Virtue/Power are the root,\nform and circumstances are the branches—\nthe root is revered while the branches are held low,\nthe root is honored while the branches are despised—\nthus all things reverence the Dao\nand honor Virtue/Power.\n\nThe Dao is the origin from which all things come,\ndescending as the pure essence that births and nurtures them.\nVirtue/Power is what things receive,\nabandoning harmony to cultivate their forms.\nWhen the Dao gives birth to things and acts as their father,\nthe Dao is revered while things are held low.\nRevered, it can overcome and diminish things.\nThis is what Zhuangzi called *True Sovereign* (真君).\n\nWhen Virtue/Power nurtures things and acts as their mother,\nVirtue/Power is honored while things are held low—\nthus things cannot despise it.\nThis is what Zhuangzi called *True Ruler* (真宰).\nThe reverence of the Dao,\nthe honor of Virtue/Power—\nnone can bestow these titles,\nyet they are ever naturally so.\n\nEmperor Ming of Tang said:\nSpeaking of the reverence and honor of the Dao and Virtue/Power,\nit is not conferred by external titles or commands,\nbut by the inherent function of giving birth and nurturing,\nwhich is ever naturally revered and honored.\n\nWang Yuanzé said:\nIf one’s life is decreed by Heaven, they become the Son of Heaven;\nif decreed by the Son of Heaven, they become a feudal lord—\nwherever life is received from another,\nthe giver can hold them low.\nOnly the Dao precedes all things\nand governs their life—\nwho could confer rank upon it?\nThus it is ever naturally revered.\n\nTherefore, the Dao gives birth, nurtures, lengthens, and matures them,\ncompletes and covers them.\nThis is profound!\n\nWhen all things transform and change,\nthe Dao gives birth with them;\nwhen all things gather and hide,\nthe Dao completes them.\nIt emerges from *Zhen* (震),\nis established in *Gèn* (艮),\nis nurtured in *Kūn* (坤),\nand is covered in *Qián* (乾).\nThe interplay of the firm and the yielding\ngrinds through the eight *trigrams* (卦),\nas though bound by a mechanism yet unable to resist—\nthe Dao truly transcends them.\n\n*Zhuǎn Wēi* said:\nThe previous passage spoke of the Dao giving birth and Virtue/Power nurturing.\nHere, Virtue/Power is not mentioned,\nfor the Dao’s single *qi* (气) permeates all without distinction,\nand the text omits the elaboration of Virtue/Power.\n\nTo receive its essence is to be born,\nto contain its *qi* is to be nurtured,\nto fulfill its form is to grow,\nto mark its *village* (村) is to mature—\n*Commentary*: This likely refers to the stages of life, not a literal village.\nTo aid its function is to complete,\nto reach its end is to be perfected,\nto preserve its harmony is to be nourished,\nto shield its harm is to be covered.\nThese eight aspects\nare the primordial functions of the Great Dao.\nHow could even the smallest living creature\nfail to revere and honor it?\n\nTo be born yet not possess its function,\nto act yet not rely on its ability,\nto grow yet not claim dominion—\nthis is called *Mysterious Virtue/Power* (玄德).\n\n*Commentary*: When the Dao gives birth to all things,\nif it were to show ownership,\nit would limit its benevolence.\nWhen it nurtures all things,\nif it were to claim its actions,\nit would dwell in its own works.\nWhen it grows and matures all creatures,\ncompletes and perfects all kinds,\nand sustains both living and non-living—\nif it were to boast its sovereignty,\nit would occupy its own length.\nSuch withdrawal into hidden depths\ncan be called profound and distant *hidden virtue/power* (阴德).\n\nEmperor Ming of Tang said:\nThis summarizes all eight meanings from above.\nThe Dao’s birth to all things,\nif it were to reveal itself as having,\nwould be constrained by its own benevolence.\nIts nurturing of all things,\nif it were to rely on its own actions,\nwould be limited by its own functions.\nIts growth and maturation of all creatures,\nits completion and perfection of all kinds,\nits sustenance of both living and non-living—\nif it were to arrogate its rule,\nit would be bound by its own length.\nThus, in possessing these qualities yet withdrawing into secrecy,\nits virtue is profound indeed,\nand its reach is distant.\nAs it was explained in the *Chapter on Nourishing the Vital Essence* (载营魄章).」\n\nThe chapter states that the person’s cultivation aligns with the Dao,\nand this chapter speaks of the Dao’s application mirroring humanity.\n\nThis chapter expounds on how **virtue/power** (德) and **Dao/Way** (道) bring forth and nurture all things,\nand how all things revere the **Dao’s virtue/power** (道德).\nThe Dao is supremely honored,\nits virtue is supremely noble—\nwho could bestow rank upon it?\nIt remains ever naturally,\nand that is all.\n\nYet when spoken of separately,\nthey exhibit distinct qualities.\nWhen spoken of together,\nthey both arise from the Dao.\nThus, it concludes with *hidden virtue/power* (玄德).\n\nHence, one who understands the Dao’s **virtue/power** (德) and **Dao/Way** (道) as unified,\nsees their profound mystery as one.\n\n**Chapter on the Origin of All Things (天下有始章) – Fifty-Second**\n\nAll things have an origin,\nand this is called the **origin of all things** (天下有始),\nthe **Mother of All Things** (天下母).\nLu Jiufu said:\n*\"All things have an origin,\nand this is called the **Mother of All Things**—\nthen the *Classic* speaks of 'five'?\nI do not know its name,\nbut this is the Dao.\"*\n\nThe nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth.\nThe named is the **Mother of all things** (万物之母).\nThe Dao is always nameless,\nyet it serves as the **Mother of All Things**—\nwhy so?\nFor though the named may suffice as the **Mother of all things**,\nit is not enough to be the **Mother of All Things** itself.\nThe nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth—\nfrom Heaven downward,\nall things are born from the nameless.\nThus, it is said:\n*\"All things have an origin,\nand this is called the **Mother of All Things**.\"*\n\nThe **origin** (始) is the Dao.\nThe Dao is the **Mother of all things** (万物母).\nThe **origin** and the **Mother** are both the Dao.\nFrom the beginning of its *qi*,\nit is called the **origin**.\nFrom its eternal nurturing,\nit is called the **Mother**.\nOnce there is an **origin**,\nit can give rise to eternal nurturing.\nHaving obtained the **Mother**,\none knows its offspring.\n**御注**: *\"The Dao, as the **Mother of all things**,\nnames them—thus, things are its offspring.\nThose who are attuned to the Dao\ncomprehend both the **Mother** and the offspring.\nThus, having known the **Mother**,\none knows its offspring.\"*\n\nWang Yuanzhe said:\n*\"All things emerge from the Dao,\nthe Dao is their **Mother**,\nand things are their offspring.\nGaining the Dao,\none understands the principles of all things\nwithout needing to discern them.\nHaving known the offspring,\none must then preserve the **Mother**—\nHe Shangong said:\n*'Having understood the principles of all things under Heaven,\none must then preserve the Dao and return to non-action,\nso that one’s life ends without peril.'*\nWang Yuanzhe said:\n*'If, after seeing the principles,\none follows them without returning to the Dao,\nthen one acts recklessly and invites disaster—\nfar from the Dao indeed.\nThus, knowing the offspring while preserving the **Mother**,\none is ever free from peril.\nHaving known the offspring,\none must then preserve the Dao,\nabandoning clever scheming\nto return to ignorance\nand safeguard oneself—\nthus, one is free from all danger of ruin.\nClose its **ui** (兑), shut its **door** (门),\nand one’s life will never be weary.\nHe Shangong said:\n*'**Ui** (兑) is the eyes—\nlet the eyes not gaze recklessly.\n**Door** (门) is the mouth—\nlet the mouth not speak recklessly.'*\nLu Jiufu said:\n*'This is the meaning of preserving the **Mother**.\nWhen the heart stirs within,\nand one indulges it,\nthis is called having **ui** (兑).\nIf one has **ui**,\nthe heart will stray outward,\nand one will lose distinction between self and things—\nthus, close its **ui** and keep it sealed,\nand the heart will not stray outward.\nWhen things draw one’s attention externally,\nand one accepts them,\nthis is called having a **door** (门).\nIf one has a **door**,\nthings will enter and disturb the heart,\nso shut its **door** and do not accept them—\nand things will not enter.\nThe heart does not stray outward,\nthings do not enter—\nthough all things change,\nand myriad transformations unfold before one,\neach returns to its root,\nyet one remains unaware.\nHow then could one be weary?'*\n\nOpen its **ui** (兑), further its affairs,\nand one’s life will never be saved.\nShu Wang said:\n*\"The opposite of 'saved' (没) is 'to exist' (存).\nThe opposite of 'beginning' (终) is 'end' (始).\nWhen paired with 'door' (门),\n'further its affairs' (济其事) implies\nthat the **door** is not shut—\nthus, affairs do not remain sealed.\nIf one further its affairs,\nthen the **door** is not shut—\nthis is clear.\"*\n\nPei Chu’en said:\n*\"Opening the **ui** of the five desires,\nfurthering the affairs of the six dusts,\nwearies the spirit within,\nfatigues the senses without—\nthis is lifelong labor and exhaustion.\"*\n\n**Seeing the Small as Clarity (见小曰明)**\n**纂微曰**: *\"This means preventing issues before they arise,\nand addressing them before they become chaotic.\nIf one knows the art of closing **ui** and shutting **door**,\nthen one sees the small and subtle—\nseeing the small and subtle,\none’s affairs cannot grow dim;\nthis is called clarity.\nFor only those who preserve the **Mother**\never see the stirrings of their hearts.\nThe small and subtle are the Dao’s subtleties—\nseeing the Dao’s subtleties,\none knows oneself alone—\nthus, there is no lack of clarity.\"*\n\n**Preserving Softness as Strength (守柔曰强)**\nZhang Junxiang said:\n*\"Following the Dao without resistance is softness;\nbeginning and ending without loss is strength.\"*\nLu Jiufu said:\n*\"Preserving the formless utmost softness,\nand no thing can overcome it.\"*\n\n**Using Its Light, Returning to Its Clarity (用其光，复归其明)**\n**御注**: *\"Clarity (明) is the essence of light.\nLight (光) is the manifestation of clarity.\nWhen the Sage responds to the world,\nclarity manifests as light—\nthus, brilliance is light.\nGathering light back into clarity,\nwisdom penetrates as clarity.\nDisplaying all virtues outwardly,\nwhile concealing their applications—\nlike the sun and moon illuminating all things,\neach thing is clear and bright,\nyet nothing is diminished—\nthis is how the Sage’s **virtue/power** (德) is divine and profound.\"*\n\nHe Shangong said:\n*\"Using its light outwardly,\none must then return its clarity inwardly,\nlest the spirit be depleted.\nAvoiding harm to oneself,\nthis is called *clinging to constancy* (袭常).\"*\n**御注**: *\"The transformations of things are without constancy.\nOnly those who return to their original nature\nabandon things and separate from humanity,\nand return to their clarity,\nwithout transforming along with things—\ntheir essence remains constant,\nfree from peril,\ndiffering from those who merge with form and become light.\"*\n\nGu Huan said:\n*\"If one opens its **ui**,\nfurthering its affairs,\ndisaster and blame will surely come.\nYet this disaster is not external calamity—\nit is self-inflicted harm.\nReflecting light inward,\nobserving the spirit within,\nnot allowing it to leak away,\nthen one’s life will never suffer disaster and blame—\nthis is called the *path of profound constancy and enduring duration* (密合常久之道).\"*\n\nThis chapter centers on the principle of preserving the **Mother**.\nThe Dao is the **Mother of all things**,\nand all things are the Dao’s offspring.\nClosing **ui**, shutting **door**,\nseeing the small, preserving softness—\neven to the point of responding to things,\nusing light, and returning to clarity—\nall are the principle of preserving the **Mother**.\nThus, its Dao remains ever constant,\nfree from disaster and blame—\nthis is the *path of profound constancy and enduring truth* (密用真常之道).\n\n**Chapter on the Sage’s Isolation (使我介然章) – Fifty-Third**\n\n*\"The Sage stands alone, with knowledge,\nwalking the Great Dao—\nonly the **Way** (施) does he fear.\"*\n\n「Lu Tian said: The Dao is preserved by having no desires,\nand is practiced by having no knowledge,\nthus it is said: *\"The Sage stands alone, with knowledge,\nwalking the Great Dao—\nonly the **Way** (施) does he fear.\"*\n\nIndeed, one with knowledge,\nwithin cannot avoid pride,\nwithout cannot avoid partiality,\nthus when he acts, he has something to fear.\n**Isolation** (介) is small yet discerning,\nknowing little of things,\nyet following the Dao with greatness.\n\nThe Dao, when practiced by one who knows,\nis already cautious of **bestowal** (施设).\nHow much more so for one with great knowledge?\nFor the **Perfect Person’s Dao** (至人之道),\ndoes not allow the superficial to harm the fundamental.\n\nIf **bestowal** (施) is excessive externally,\nthen the inner **roots** (根本) will be depleted.\nThus, those walking the Great Dao\ndo not nurture trifling concerns,\nand all entanglements are abandoned;\nthere is no room for **isolated knowledge** (介然之知).\n\n**Yin Que** asked **Wang Ni**,\nfour questions posed, four answers unknown.\nThe Great Dao is most **level** (夷),\nyet people love **shortcuts** (径).\n\nLu Tian said: A **shortcut** (径) is not the path,\ntaking shortcuts while hastening brings affliction.\n**Level** (夷) means plain and easy.\nA **shortcut** (径) is crooked, not upright.\nPeople are confused,\nabandoning the Great Dao and not following it,\npreferring crooked shortcuts to seek swiftness,\ndesiring speed to invite near-term success,\nusing knowledge to seek the Dao while drifting farther from it.\n\nMoreover, how could they know\nthat the Great Dao is attained by **knowing without knowing** (以不知而知),\nthat is the most **level** (夷) of all?\nPeople instead wish to seek it through knowledge,\nloving shortcuts while unaware of their inner harm.\n\n**Dan Tai Mie Ming** (澹台灭明),\nwalking without shortcuts,\nis thus walking the Great Dao.\n\nThe harms of shortcuts are fully detailed below:\n\n**Morning affairs are most neglected** (朝甚除),\nGu Xuan said: *除* (除) means to **overindulge** (修).\nThose who love shortcuts\nconsider only the **overindulgence of courtly affairs** (修朝) as good.\n\nThe **palaces of Zhou**, the **Chang Hua of Chu**, the **Ai Fang of Qin**—\nall are examples of this.\n\n**Fields are most overgrown** (田甚芜),\nHe Shang Gong said: High towers and pavilions,\ncourtly affairs **overindulged** (修),\nfarm work abandoned,\nnot plowing and tilling in season.\n\nGu Xuan said: When grass grows tall, it is called *overgrown* (芜).\n*Overgrown* (芜) means **neglect and ruin** (荒废).\nIf one indulges in **carved halls and painted walls** (峡宇雕墙),\nexhausting wealth and beauty to the utmost,\nthen human effort is drained,\nfields lie **neglected and ruined** (芜荒),\ninner **clarity** (明) is **sacrificed for outward fame and gain** (徇名好利),\nabandoning little for much,\n**Dao practice and alchemical work** (道业) are not cultivated,\nthe **elixir field** (丹田) lies **neglected and ruined**.\n\nMany fields lie **ruined** (荒),\nthis is why the *Book of Songs* (《诗》) censures **King You of the Shang** (幽王).\n**Granaries are most empty** (仓甚虚),\n\nShu Wang said: *除* (除) means **governance** (治).\nThough courtly affairs are **governed** (治),\nfields instead become **ruined** (芜),\ngranaries instead become **empty** (虚).\nGranaries are the **roots** (本).\nNow they are **ruined and empty** (芜虚),\nthis is from people abandoning the Great Dao\nand rushing toward shortcuts.\n\nWang Yuanze said: When fields are **governed** (治),\ngranaries are filled,\nthis is the **root** (本) of a state.\nNow they instead **overindulge** (务除) in courtly affairs,\nfor the sake of short-term splendor,\nwhile not heeding that the **roots have already been depleted** (根本之已竭),\nhow could this be the **path of enduring duration** (持久之道)?\n\nThose who **sacrifice clarity for superficial gain** (以末伤本者),\nare all like this.\n\n**Wearing ornate attire** (服文彩),\nHe Shang Gong said: **Loving false adornment and outward splendor** (好饰伪，贵外华).\n**Green and red** (青赤) are

If they lack virtue/power to display, and no traces remain to be seen, then their roots are deep and their foundation firm, and they are not pulled away by the winds of right and wrong, desire or evil. If, however, those who establish virtue/power seek fame by cutting down virtue/power, flaunt their deeds to gain reward, and though their outward virtues are displayed, their hidden merit is not cultivated, they will ultimately be uprooted by the impermanent obstacles of karma. Thus, the **Huainanzi** says: \"A foundation of virtue/power is seen in one's appearance. Gold is consumed by fire, fire is extinguished by water, water is blocked by earth, wood is felled by an axe. Only that which is founded upon the foundationless (無建者) cannot be uprooted.\"*\n\n**Those who embrace virtue/power do not lose it** (善抱者不脱),\n**Annotations by Zuan Wei:** *Those who embrace the Dao/Way to hold the unity of the primal essence (元), then their vital essence and spirit (精神) remain whole and do not slip away.*\n**Commentary by Shū Wáng:** *To embrace (抱) is to be one (一). If one embraces unity and does not depart from it, then there is no loss.*\n**Sacrifices by descendants never cease.**\n**Commentary of the Imperial Edict:** *The foundation is centered within the Dao/Way and not external to it; embracing unity without separation from vital essence. If one is such, how could their influence be confined to a single state or generation? Rather, it will extend to the whole world and future ages, its transmission far indeed.*\n**Commentary by Tang Emperor Xuanzong:** *It speaks of a ruler who establishes virtue/power and embraces the Dao/Way, whose merit extends to posterity, cherishing the sweet osmanthus trees (甘棠) for their descendants. For rulers, their ancestors have merit, and their lineage has virtue/power. Thus, the rise of the Zhou began with Hou Ji and was completed by King Wen and King Wu. The Zhou sacrifices were made to Hou Ji at the outer altars (郊祀), and to King Wen at the ancestral temples (宗祀). Though divination predicted a change after thirty generations, and a span of seven hundred years, the destruction of the temple's main deity (毁庙之主) and the scattering of its influence (流溢於外), the sacrifices to Hou Ji and King Wen at the outer altars and ancestral temples never ceased.*\n\n**Cultivate it in oneself, and its virtue/power becomes true** (修之身，其德乃真);\n**Commentary by Dù Biàn:** *Illustrate the near cultivation and distant establishment of the Dao/Way in oneself, so that it does not slip away, and its roots are firm. Cultivating oneself in this way, true virtue/power lies within oneself.*\n\n**Cultivate it in the family, and its virtue/power overflows** (修之家，其德乃余);\n**Commentary by Hé Shàng Gōng:** *In a family that cultivates the Dao/Way, the father is benevolent, the son is filial, the elder brother is friendly, the younger brother is obedient, the husband is trustworthy, and the wife is chaste. Such virtue/power overflows indeed.*\n**Commentary by Wáng Bì:** *This extends from oneself to others.*\n\n**Cultivate it in oneself, and its virtue/power overflows; cultivate it in the family, and its virtue/power becomes long-lasting.**\n**Cultivate it in the community, and its virtue/power becomes abundant;**\n**Cultivate it in the state, and its virtue/power becomes plentiful;**\n**Cultivate it in the world, and its virtue/power becomes universal.**\n**Commentary of the Imperial Edict:** *Cultivate it in oneself, and its virtue/power becomes true. This is the Dao/Way’s true virtue/power to govern oneself. Cultivate it in the family, and its virtue/power overflows. Cultivate it in the community, and its virtue/power becomes long-lasting. This is the surplus extending to govern others. Cultivate it in the state, and its virtue/power becomes abundant. Cultivate it in the world, and its virtue/power becomes universal. This is the straight path to govern the world and its states. The farther one cultivates, the broader its virtue/power becomes. Within oneself, it is all true. In others, it is merely the superficial aspect. Thus, overflowing leads to long-lasting, and abundant leads to universal—these are external to the Dao/Way.*\n\n**Annotations by Zuan Wei:** *These five stages begin with near cultivation of oneself and extend far to the world. Thus, observe oneself to understand oneself; observe the family to understand the family...*\n\n**Commentary by Dào Chōng:** *Examine the gains and losses, right and wrong of oneself, and one will know all people. Examine the harmony or discord, prosperity or decline of one’s family, and one will know other families.*\n\n**Observe the community to understand the community; observe the state to understand the state; observe the world to understand the world.**\n**Commentary of the Imperial Edict:** *All things are complete within me. Reflecting sincerely upon oneself, no greater joy exists. Thus, by observing oneself to understand oneself, one’s self is governed. Extending this analogy...*\n\n**The world has its constants, yet by observing them, the world is governed.**\n**Annotations by Zuan Wei:** *To observe is to scrutinize and reflect. Thus, by the Dao/Way of sage-rulers (先、圣) to govern oneself, reflect upon my own body and mind. If my body and mind can embody the Dao/Way, then its virtue/power is true. By the Dao/Way of sage-rulers to govern the family, reflect upon my own family. If my family can harmonize their relationships, then its virtue/power overflows. By the Dao/Way of sage-rulers to govern the community, reflect upon my own neighbors. If my neighbors can trust in their friends, then its virtue/power becomes long-lasting. By the Dao/Way of sage-rulers to govern the state, reflect upon my own citizens. If my citizens can fulfill their lives, then its virtue/power becomes abundant. By the Dao/Way of sage-rulers to govern the world, reflect upon all the people in the world. If they can be without desire and without knowledge, then its virtue/power becomes universal. How do I know the world is thus? By this.*\n\n**Commentary by Hé Shàng Gōng:** *The **Laozi** says: \"How do I know the world?\" Those who cultivate the Dao/Way thrive, while those who abandon it perish. By these five stages, one observes and knows it.*\n\n**Commentary by Wáng Bì:** *This is what was spoken of above. It says: \"How do I know the world?\" Observe oneself to know it, seeking no knowledge from outside. This is the saying: \"Without leaving one’s door, one knows the world.\"*\n\n**Commentary by Wáng Yuàn Zé:** *The sage-rulers uphold one Dao/Way, with no other divergent teachings. Thus, their method of being and their method of knowing are all derived from this Dao/Way. This chapter begins by speaking of those who establish virtue/power, embrace it, and thereby know the world—these are the fundamental principles of the world itself. Those who establish virtue/power and embrace it are the cultivation of oneself. Extending this to the world, one can say it is the foundation of governance and knowledge.*\n\n---\n\n**Chapter on the Depth of Embracing Virtue/Power** (含德之厚章第五十五):\n\n**The depth of embracing virtue/power** (含德之厚)\n**is like that of an infant.**\n**Commentary of the Imperial Edict:** *Only the common people are born with thick virtue/power; as they grow, their nature changes. But those who deeply embrace virtue/power do not change with circumstances, thus their **qi** is concentrated and their will is unified.*\n**Commentary by Mèngzǐ:** *The noble person does not lose their infantile heart.*\n**Commentary by Tang Emperor Xuanzong:** *The perfected sage (至人) who deeply embraces the richness of virtue/power and the Dao/Way, their conduct is like that of an infant.*\n\n**Chapter on the Depth of Embracing Virtue/Power** (含德之厚章第五十五)\n\nLǚ Jífǔ said:\n*\"When a person is first born, their virtue and nature are most profound and rich.*\n*As they grow older, their ears and eyes engage with the external world,*\n*and their mind and awareness receive impressions from within.*\n*With the passage of days, their richness diminishes.*\n*Those who cultivate the Dao/Way reduce what they have gained through growth,*\n*refining their nature and returning to their original virtue.*\n*Thus, it is said:*\n*'The depth of embracing virtue/power is like that of an infant.'*\n*含 (contain) is the same as 抱 (embrace).*\n*The infant’s nature is pure yet undispersed,*\n*their qi is harmonious and not violent.*\n*Those who deeply embrace virtue/power*\n*possess a nature inherently profound and rich,*\n*unshaken by external influences,*\n*thus likened to an infant.*\n*But embracing virtue/power to its fullest*\n*is not merely to have the appearance of an infant—*\n*it is to possess the infant’s heart.*\n*Venomous creatures do not sting them,*\n*ferocious beasts do not attack them,*\n*and raptors do not seize them.*\n\nZhāng Jūnxiàng said:\n*\"Venomous creatures—such as bees, wasps, and snakes—*\n*strike by means of their qi.*\n*Ferocious beasts—like tigers and rhinoceroses—*\n*trample with their feet.*\n*Raptors—such as hawks and eagles—*\n*injure with their claws.*\n*The infant has no intention of harm,*\n*thus they are not harmed by such creatures.*\n*Moreover,*\n*venomous creatures symbolize anger,*\n*ferocious beasts symbolize delusion,*\n*and raptors symbolize greed.*\n*The infant transcends these three evils,*\n*thus they are not injured by the Three Poisons.*\n*Those who deeply embrace virtue/power*\n*practice enduring compassion and patience,*\n*generating no anger within,*\n*so it is said that venomous creatures do not sting them.*\n*Having relinquished all attachment,*\n*they have no greed or desire,*\n*thus likened to raptors that do not seize.*\n*They possess constant clarity and wisdom,*\n*forever free from delusion,*\n*so it is said that ferocious beasts do not attack them.*\n*The infant, being in perfect harmony with the received qi,*\n*has no intention of harm,*\n*thus nothing can injure them.*\n*How much more so for those whose qi is fully guarded and harmonized!*\n*What creature, shaped by external forces yet in perfect accord with all things,*\n*could possibly harm them?*\n*Zhuāngzǐ said:*\n*'When a person can empty themselves and wander through the world,*\n*who could harm them?'*\n*Their bones are weak, their sinews soft, yet their grip is firm.*\n*Héshàng Gōng said:*\n*'The infant’s sinews and bones are weak yet their grip is firm,*\n*because their intention is concentrated and their mind unshaken.'*\n*The infant’s intention is concentrated, their will unified,*\n*their mind knows nothing, their hands do nothing—*\n*thus their fists naturally clench with unyielding strength.*\n*They do not yet know the union of male and female*\n*yet their movements are spontaneous and pure,*\n*their essence at its peak.*\n\nThe Imperial Edict commentary said:\n*\"Those whose virtue is complete possess a form that is complete,*\n*thus their bones are weak and their sinews soft yet their grip is firm.*\n*Those whose form is complete have a spirit that is complete,*\n*thus they do not yet know the union of male and female*\n*yet their movements are spontaneous and pure.*\n*When their essence is at its peak,*\n*they can enter the spirit and restore their vital command (神命).\"*\n\nZhuāngzǐ said:\n*\"The sage values essence (精).\"*\n\nLín Língsù said:\n*\"作 (movement) refers to the infant’s yin (obscure, receptive force).*\n*牝牡之合 (union of male and female) is the interplay of yin and yang.*\n*The infant, not yet knowing the principles of union,*\n*yet moving spontaneously,*\n*possesses essence that does not disperse.*\n*Those who deeply embrace virtue/power,*\n*though enlightened to all dharmas,*\n*remain in a state of emptiness and stillness,*\n*yet do not abandon movement.*\n*They respond to things without attachment,*\n*their actions in accord with virtue and the times—*\n*this is the manifestation of tranquil bodily conduct.\"*\n\nWáng Yuànzé said:\n*\"If their movement arises from external craving,*\n*then it is the infant’s essence being squandered,*\n*and death follows.*\n*How could such a state endure?*\n*This is the greatest affliction of the world,*\n*yet also the most critical warning for those who seek the Dao/Way.\"*\n\n*The infant cries all day without ceasing,*\n*yet their voice does not grow hoarse—*\n*this is the harmony of essence at its utmost.*\n\nThe Imperial Edict commentary said:\n*\"To achieve unity is to attain essence (精).*\n*Essence ensures virtue is complete and the spirit undiminished.*\n*Harmony arises from the received qi (冲气).*\n*Harmony ensures the qi is complete and the throat does not grow hoarse.*\n*When a person is born,*\n*their essence is received from the One (天一) as the source of wisdom,*\n*and their harmony is obtained from the Five (天五) as the foundation of trust.*\n*When this harmony reaches its peak,*\n*they can enter the spirit and restore their vital command (神命).*\n*But those who lose the infant’s heart*\n*let their essence waver without restraint,*\n*their qi erupt violently and impurely,*\n*driving their form and nature to exhaustion,*\n*and sinking them into the myriad things—*\n*is this not tragic?\"*\n\n*When crying reaches its limit yet produces no sound, it is called 嗄 (hoarse).*\n*The infant, from morning to evening,*\n*cries without variation in tone,*\n*because their mind is unmoved and their qi harmonious.*\n*If the infant’s mind were troubled by worry or resentment,*\n*their qi would clash and become unharmonious—*\n*could it remain thus?*\n*Those who deeply embrace virtue/power*\n*utter profound speech without exhaustion,*\n*and expound the law without depletion—*\n*this too is the result of embracing the harmonious and received qi.*\n\n*\"To know harmony is to know constancy (常).\"*\nShū Wáng said:\n*\"Harmony, in its application, is constant and unchanging,*\n*thus it is said:*\n*'To know harmony is to know constancy (常).'*\n*When a person knows that their qi is harmonious yet weak,*\n*they hold command over their life,*\n*possessing constancy that does not vary.*\n*Thus, at the peak of cultivating the Dao/Way,*\n*they attain the restoration of vital command (复命).*\n*To restore vital command is to know constancy (常).*\n*Embracing virtue/power to its depth*\n*leads one to know harmony,*\n*and to know harmony is to know constancy (常).*\n*Though virtue/power and the Dao/Way may seem separate,*\n*when they converge in constancy (常),*\n*they become One.*\n*To know constancy is to be enlightened (明).\"*\n\nSōng Língxiān said:\n*\"Harmony is the undivided middle.*\n*The Dao/Way is One, without relative form,*\n*unchanged by birth and death,*\n*thus it is named constancy (常).*\n*To know this constancy*\n*brings daily enlightenment.\"*\n\nShū Wáng said:\n*\"Without enlightenment, one cannot know constancy (常).\"*\n\n*\"To increase what is already born is called 祥 (auspicious).\"*\nShū Wáng said:\n*\"Birth cannot be increased,*\n*yet people always seek to augment what is born—*\n*this brings disaster and inauspiciousness (凶祥).\"*\n\nSūn Dēng said:\n*\"The richness of perpetual birth*\n*is a perversion that brings auspicious yet ominous transformations.*\n*Once their form is received,*\n*their innate divisions are fixed,*\n*their vital processes fully sufficient—*\n*no lack, no excess.*\n*If nourished directly,*\n*they will reach their peak.*\n*But if one forcibly increases it,*\n*it becomes only an encumbrance,*\n*not merely useless but harmful—*\n*this is called disaster and inauspiciousness (凶祥).\"*\n\n*\"The mind directing the qi is called 强 (forced).\"*\nThe Imperial Edict commentary said:\n*\"When the body aligns with the mind,*\n*and the mind aligns with the qi,*\n*then the qi is harmonious and not violent.*\n*Those who rush or stumble—*\n*this is the qi.*\n*If the mind truly directs it,*\n*then it is forced (强).*\n*To contend with things thus*\n*is not the Dao/Way of self-mastery.\"*\n\nShū Wáng said:\n*\"The qi should be concentrated to achieve softness (柔).*\n*Now it is instead directed by the mind,*\n*unable to remain inwardly guarded,*\n*thus it becomes violent.\"*\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"When the mind directs the qi, it is called 强 (forced).\"*\n*The Classic of Documents says:*\n*\"Do good deeds, and auspiciousness will descend upon you a hundredfold.\"*\n*The previous chapter says:*\n*\"Guarding softness is called 强 (forced).\"*\n*Here, auspiciousness is not the auspiciousness of doing good deeds—*\n*it is the inauspiciousness of calamitous omens.*\n*Here, 强 (forced) is not the 强 (forced) of guarding softness—*\n*it is the 强 (forced) of tyranny and aggression.*\n\n*Wang Yuanze said:*\n*\"If the mind directs the qi, then the qi in turn directs the mind.*\n*When mind and qi vie for control,*\n*the harmony of Heaven is destroyed,*\n*and the True Essence is diminished.*\n*What a person receives cannot be artificially increased or diminished.*\n*Thus, both forcing growth and depleting the qi*\n*are violations of natural order.*\n*Mencius warned against pulling up seedlings to hasten their growth,*\n*and Laozi spoke against artificially augmenting life.*\n*All that is

decay.*\n\n*This chapter speaks of the infant’s lack of contrivance,*\n*and those who embody profound virtue resemble this.*\n*The infant harms nothing with its mind,*\n*yet nothing harms it in return.*\n*Thus its essence remains whole and undispersed,*\n*its qi harmonious and unviolent.*\n*To know this is to grasp the True Constant.*\n*If one does not know this,*\n*then artificially

Edict commentary said:*\n*\"Retreat and conceal within the profound.*\n*Withdraw to store oneself in secrecy.\"*\n\n*The Compilation of Subtleties said:*\n*\"This passage shares the same text as Chapter Fifty-Two,*\n*yet its meaning differs.*\n*There, it emphasizes the Dao’s purity and stillness,*\n*to block the roots of desires and joys.*\n*Here, it upholds the Dao’s wordlessness,*\n*thus invoking the saying of diminishing hearing and discarding sight.*\n\n*The Dao is formless,*\n*thus it cannot be seen with the eyes,*\n*nor transmitted by the mouth.*\n*The Perfect One closes the

turn—*\n*hence, they are the most noble under Heaven.\"*\n\nLǚ Jìfǔ said:\n\nIf this is so, then all things are stored within a single treasury,\nand life and death share the same form.\nThere is nothing to be particularly close to,\nnor anything to be particularly distant from—\nthus, one cannot be drawn to closeness,\nnor pushed toward distance.\n\nOne does not pursue gain,\nnor shun harm—\nthus, one cannot be said to benefit,\nnor be said to suffer harm.\n\nOne does not glory in prominence,\nnor wallow in obscurity—\nthus, one cannot be exalted,\nnor debased.\n\nThose who can be drawn to closeness or distance,\nbenefit or harm,\nnobility or lowliness—\ntheir worth lies in things,\nand all things hold them in contempt.\n\nThose who cannot be drawn to closeness or distance,\nbenefit or harm,\nnobility or lowliness—\ntheir worth lies within themselves,\nand no thing can debase them.\nHow could they not be the most noble under Heaven?\n\nThose who cannot be drawn to closeness or distance—\nlike Liè Yùzōu dwelling in the gardens of Zhèng,\nwhere no one recognizes him—\nis the case.\n\nThose who cannot be said to benefit or harm—\nlike Liè Zǐ declining Zhèng Zǐyáng’s grain—\nis the case.\n\nThose who cannot be said to be noble or lowly—\nlike Zēng Zǐ dwelling in Wèi—\nis the case.\n\nThis chapter extols forgetting speech to embody the Dao;\nthe following passages all demonstrate the Way of silent completion.\nWho, then, can be drawn to closeness or distance,\nbenefit or harm,\nnobility or lowliness?\n\nTrue nobility resides within oneself—\nno thing can debase it,\nthus they are the most noble under Heaven.\n\n*—From the chapter \"Govern with Dao to Rule the State\" (Chapter Fifty-Seven)*\n\nThe embodiment of the Dao in its constancy is called *zhèng* (正).\n*Zhèng* rests in oneness without change—this is the constancy of the Dao.\nThe Way of governing the state holds constancy as its highest virtue.\nMencius said: *\"Rectify the ruler, and the state will be settled.\"*\n\nIn warfare, *\"qí\"* (奇) is employed—\nGu Huān remarked: *\"Qí* is the art of deception and adaptation.\"\nFacing peril, one must master change—warfare knows no surfeit of deceit.\nThe *Sānlüè Jiǔqí* (三略九奇) and *Jiǔgōng Bǎishèng* (九攻百胜)\nare the achievements of the supreme general:\ncalming strife, ending rebellion, and securing martial virtue.\n\nLiu Zhòngpíng said:\n*\"What is impure and mixed is the common heart of the world.\nWhat flows without restraint is the common emotion of the world.\nBut the Way of *zhèng* differs entirely from this.\nThus, to be one without mixture—this is the essence of *zhèng*.\nTo be still without yielding—this is the application of *zhèng*.\nTo be one without mixture is to command what is impure.\nTo be still without yielding is to govern what flows unrestrained.\nTherefore, the ruler of a state must not seek it elsewhere—\nonly by upholding *zhèng* can governance be secured.\n\nBut in warfare, it is otherwise.\nWielding deadly weapons, confronting peril, commanding ten thousand,\nvictory or defeat may hinge on a single moment.\nIf one can subdue the enemy, then seizing opportunity and adapting to change—\nthere is nothing that cannot be achieved.\nThus, its manner differs from governing the state,\nand so *qí* is employed rather than *zhèng*.\n\nTo take the world with *wúshì* (無事).\n\n*—Commentary:* *Zhèng* is the constancy of the Dao,\n*qí* is its variation,\n*wúshì* is its true essence.\nA state is governed by *zhèng*,\nwarfare is won by *qí*,\nand the true Dao admits no private favor.\nWhen one follows nature effortlessly, the world is at peace.\n\n*The Miscellaneous Sayings* state:\n*\"Zhèng* suffices to govern a single state,\n*qí* suffices to wield the five armies.\nOnly *wúshì* can take the world.\nThus it is said: 'To take the world, one must first be *wúshì*.\nWhen conflict arises, it is no longer sufficient to take the world.'\n\nYet, did not Táng and Wǔ launch their campaigns without *wúshì*?\"\nIt is replied:\n*\"Táng and Wǔ aligned with Heaven and responded to humanity.\nTheir conquests were as effortless as dismissing a single man—\nthere was no 'conflict' in the true sense.\nHow do I know the world is thus?\nBy this.\"*\n\nEmperor Tang Minghuang said: *\"By this, the following text is understood.*\n\nWhen the world abounds in taboos and prohibitions, the people grow ever poorer.\n*Zhuǎn Wēi* explains: *\"Taboos\"* refers to decrees and edicts.\n\nA ruler cannot refrain from governance, yet uses laws and teachings to rule the state. When prohibitions and nets of law are dense, the people fear transgression, unable to move hand or foot. They have no time but to avoid taboos, daring not to act—every movement disrupts their livelihood, and poverty follows daily.\n*Wang Yuanzé* says: *\"When actions are forbidden, the people are unsettled and lose their means of subsistence—thus, they become poor.\"* This is where disorder begins.\n\nWhen the people possess many sharp tools, the state grows ever more corrupt.\n*Wang Bi* says: *\"Sharp tools are instruments for self-advantage.\"* When the people grow strong, the state weakens.\n*Wang Yuanzé* says: *\"Where sharp tools exist, there must be scheming intentions. When scheming arises, the lower ranks become untrustworthy, and thus the state grows corrupt.\"*\n\nWhen the people excel in craft and artifice, strange things proliferate.\n*The Imperial Commentary* states: *\"When skill and artifice prevail, people turn to frivolous pursuits, and bizarre garments and strange tools emerge to disrupt customs.\"*\n*Wang Bi* says: *\"When the people are too clever, deceit and artifice arise. Where deceit and artifice arise, wicked deeds follow.\"*\n*Zhuǎn Wēi* explains: *\"Craft and artifice\"* refer to skilled and ingenious workmanship.\n\nWhen laws and edicts grow ever more pronounced, thieves and bandits multiply.\nEmperor Tang Minghuang says: *\"When *wúwéi* is abandoned, laws grow ever clearer. Those who exploit the law for deceit become thieves—how could they not multiply?\"*\nPrince Shū says: *\"Laws are meant to prohibit wrongdoing in the world. Yet because they prohibit wrongdoing, they give rise to deceit. For where laws are made, deceit follows; where edicts are issued, trickery arises. Thus it is said: When laws and edicts grow ever more pronounced, thieves and bandits multiply.\"*\n\nTherefore, the Sage says:\n*River Above Master* [i.e., Laozi] says: *\"This refers to the following text.\"*\n\nThe Sage says:\n\n*\"I practice wúwéi, and the people transform of themselves.*\n**Commentary:** *Heaven acts with wúwéi and thus remains clear; Earth acts with wúwéi and thus remains tranquil. When these two wúwéi harmonize, all things transform. The Sage embodies Heaven and Earth, so the people daily advance in virtue without knowing who guides them.*\n\n*Emperor Yao and Shun sat in silent repose within the Hall of Law, hands folded in repose, observing the flourishing of the people. The Duke of Zhou and Wu Wang governed without knowing or acting, yet all followed in harmony. The Emperor ruled with sleeves draped and hands folded, and the realm was governed—this is the Way of the Sage: wúwéi, yet the people transform.*\n\n*Zhuangzi says: ‘With wúwéi, all things transform.’*\n\n*I do nothing, and the people grow wealthy.*\n**River Above Master says:** *I impose no corvée labor or conscription, so the people secure in their occupations, and all grow wealthy.*\n**The *Lèi Jié* says:** *When the heart practices wúwéi and actions do nothing, the four classes take joy in their work, and the people prosper abundantly. This reverses the world’s excess of prohibitions, which only makes the people poorer.*\n\n*When the ruler does nothing, forced labor does not arise, and the people’s agricultural seasons are not disrupted—thus they grow wealthy. This further explains the meaning of ‘the people grow poorer’ from above.*\n\n*I love stillness, and the people become upright.*\n**Wang Yuanzé says:** *To love stillness is to return to one’s nature. When the ruler returns to nature, the people also return to nature, and thus become upright.*\n**This further explains the meaning of ‘thieves and bandits multiply’ from above.*\n**Yang Fu says:** *When I act, the people become perverse; when I am still, the people become upright. This reverses the harm of excessive sharp tools, which bring confusion to the state.*\n\n*I have no desires, and the people return to simplicity.*\n**Emperor Tang Minghuang says:** *With wúwéi, there is clarity and stillness, so the people transform. With no affairs, there is no disturbance, so the people grow wealthy. With love of stillness, one attains nature, so the people become upright. With no desires, harmony is preserved, so the people return to simplicity. This is the Way of taking the world without action.*\n\n*Simplicity is the preservation of nature. When my nature is whole and I have no desires, the people also have no desires and return to simplicity.*\n**This further explains the meaning of ‘strange things’ from above.*\n**This chapter advocates taking the world without action.*\n\n*From ‘the world abounds in prohibitions’ to ‘thieves and bandits multiply’—this is the error of taking the world with action. From ‘I practice wúwéi and the people transform’ to ‘I have no desires and the people return to simplicity’—this is the proof of taking the world without action.*\n\n---\n**Chapter 58: The Governance of Murky Tranquility**\n\n*When governance is murky and tranquil, the people are pure and thick.*\n**River Above Master says:** *When governance is broad and tranquil, as if unclear, the people become pure and abundant, living in mutual harmony.*\n**Emperor Tang Minghuang says:** *When governance is murky and tranquil, without action or strictness, the people respond with purity and simplicity.*\n**Lǚ Jìfǔ says:** *‘Pure and thick’ means they are not thin or sparse.*\n\n*When governance is sharp and scrutinizing, the people become depleted and exhausted.*\n**Emperor Tang Minghuang says:** *When governance is sharp and scrutinizing, with action and urgency, the people respond with depletion and decay.*\n**Prince Shū says:** *‘Murky and tranquil’ means no distinctions are made. Only when no distinctions are made can the people remain without knowledge or desire, and thus they are pure and thick. ‘Sharp and scrutinizing’ means distinctions are made. When distinctions are made, the people cannot remain without knowledge or desire, and thus they become depleted and exhausted.*\n**Lǚ Jìfǔ says:** *‘Depleted and exhausted’ means they are not fully simple.*\n\n*Disaster, yet fortune depends upon it,*\n**River Above Master says:** *‘Depends upon’ means ‘arises from.’ Disaster arises from fortune. When one encounters disaster and reflects, blaming oneself and cultivating virtue, disaster departs and fortune arrives.*\n\n*Fortune, yet disaster lurks within it.*\n**River Above Master says:** *Disaster lurks hidden within fortune. When one obtains fortune and becomes arrogant, fortune departs and disaster arrives.*\n**Emperor Tang Minghuang says:** *‘Depends upon’ means ‘arises from.’ ‘Lurks within’ means ‘is hidden in.’ Above, it is said that when governance is murky and tranquil, the people mistakenly believe there is no governance, yet they become pure and simple. This is disaster arising from fortune. When governance is sharp and scrutinizing, the people believe there is governance, yet they become depleted and exhausted—this is fortune hiding disaster.*\n\n*Where disaster and fortune depend upon and lurk within the realm of auspiciousness and inauspiciousness, where shall one reside?*\n*Indeed, when disaster comes and one is not afraid, reflecting and blaming oneself to avoid disaster—this is to dwell between disaster and fortune. If so, disaster will not come, nor will fortune arrive. Disaster and fortune will be nonexistent, and who would suffer calamity?*\n*Zhuangzi says: ‘At peace with disaster and fortune.’*\n\n*Who knows their limit?*\n**River Above Master says:** *Disaster and fortune generate each other; who can know their end?*\n**Sun Deng says:** *‘Who’ means ‘who.’ ‘Limit’ means ‘exhaustion.’ One person’s disaster and fortune interdepend, alternating without fixed pattern—disaster arises from fortune, fortune comes through disaster—who can know their exhaustion?*\n\n*There is no fixed right or wrong.*\n**Wang Yuanzé says:** *The great course does not linger in any age—this is to wish to establish the right, yet not knowing that the right cannot be constant. Then can this be called wisdom?*\n*Although it is said there is no fixed right, this is to take ‘no fixed right’ as the right. ‘Wrong’ is a doubtful phrase, yet it is also not fixed in ‘no fixed right.’*\n*The right becomes strange, the good becomes ominous, and the people’s confusion has long endured.*\n**Commentary:** *All under Heaven is but one breath. What was right yesterday may be wrong today; what was contrary before may align later. Divine and strange, fragrant and putrid—these transform into each other, beginning and ending. Thus, the strange and the right generate each other, the ominous and the good alternate. This is the natural unfolding of one breath.*\n\n*The world has existed for long—small errors change methods, great errors change nature. The customs of selfishness prevail and are not illuminated. Where disaster and fortune depend upon and lurk, and governance is sharp and scrutinizing, how can the people return to their true nature?*\n**Lǚ Dì says:** *‘There is no fixed right or wrong’—this means there is right when there is right, and right is what is called right. Right is without fixed right. Only when there is no fixed right can one transcend the realm of auspiciousness and inauspiciousness, having neither disaster nor fortune, and know their limit.*\n\n「If one cannot attain the state of *Wu Zheng* [無正, \"without fixed right\"], but instead wanders into the realm of auspiciousness and inauspiciousness, then disaster and fortune will follow in turn—like the revolving of a wheel, like the cycling of seasons—ultimately leading only to confusion.\n\nHence it is said: *Wu Zheng* becomes *Qi* [奇, \"strange\"], *Shan* [善, \"good\"] turns into *Yao* [妖, \"ominous\"]. The people’s confusion is indeed long-standing.\n\nThus, the Sage is square yet does not cut [方而不割],*\n**御注:** *Square* refers to being steadfast in the Dao/Way while not rigidly fixed, flowing without obstruction, yet leaving no trace of discrimination.*\n\n**Gu Xuan** says: *Square one’s conduct, and the strange and ominous will keep their distance; one does not sever with one’s steadfastness, yet they follow along.*\n\nFrugal yet not stingy [廉而不刿],*\n**御注:** *Frugal* means maintaining purity in oneself.*\n**Wang Bi** says: *Frugal* is the same as *clean and at ease*. *Sath* [刿, \"stingy\"] is to harm. To guide the people with purity and ease, ordering them to abandon their evil, ordering them to cast off their impurities—this is not to harm them with purity and ease.*\n\nStraightforward yet not domineering [直而不肆],*\n**He Shang Gong** says: *Dominering* means to press one’s views upon others.*\nThe Sage, though straight, bends to follow others; never does he press his own views.*\n**Wang Bi** says: *To guide with straightforwardness, ordering them to abandon their perversity, yet not to press one’s own straightforwardness upon them, provoking resistance—this is what is meant by \"great straightness is like bending.\"*\n**Wang Yuanze** says: *Straightforwardness that is domineering will have its own straightness. Great straightness aligns with principle, remaining constant; bending to follow principle. The *Book of Documents* says: \"Straightforward yet gentle, gentle so as not to harm within.\"* Straightforward yet harsh externally, not harsh so as to domineer over others—this is what is meant by *not domineering*.\nThe *Analects* says: *\"Of substance yet loving righteousness, bright yet not dazzling.\"*\n**御注:** *Straightforwardness that is domineering will domineer over others, and the faults of such behavior will manifest; brightness that dazzles will invite the calamity of flaunting one’s deeds.*\n\nTo be straight within yet yielding without, to use one’s brightness yet return to one’s clarity—this is only the Sage.\n\nWhen the people are confused, those who take *Wu Zheng* [方, \"square\"] as correct are like the *Zi Mo* [子莫] who clutches the disorder in his mouth. Those who take *Kang* [康, \"at ease\"] as correct are like the *Zhong Zi* [仲子] who holds his breath. Knowing how to stretch yet not knowing how to bend, knowing how to display yet not knowing how to conceal—with such boastful, worldly customs, they lose the Sage’s complete harmony. How can they rectify the world?\n\nThe Sage rectifies the world—how? Thus and no other way.\n\n**Wang Yuanze** says: *Brightness that dazzles others is called \"dazzling.\"* To harmonize one’s brightness and return to one’s clarity—how can this be dazzling? This passage speaks of disaster and fortune, *Wu Zheng* and *Qi*, *Shan* and *Yao* generating each other, yet the people cannot know their confusion. Indeed, it has been long-standing—how then can they be further misled by sharp and scrutinizing governance? How can the people preserve their original purity?\n\nThus, though the Sage is square, at ease, straightforward, and bright in his own conduct, he never displays his traces to show others. He takes this *mèn mèn* [闷闷, \"mysterious and unassuming\"], abandoning that *chácháchá* [察察, \"sharp and scrutinizing\"], and thus remains tranquil amid disaster and fortune.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 59: Governing People and Serving Heaven [治人事天]**\n\nGoverning people and serving Heaven—nothing surpasses frugality [啬].\n**御注:** *Frugality* is the preservation of one’s spirit and essence without external depletion or internal waste.*\n\nThe spirit and essence flow boundlessly in all directions, reaching their utmost without limit—above, they touch Heaven; below, they coil within Earth. Transforming and nurturing all things, their name is *Tong Di* [同帝, \"in harmony with the Emperor\"]. This is how Heaven becomes Heaven and humanity becomes humanity—only through *Yin* [音, \"resonance/harmony\"].\n\nTo cherish and nourish the spirit and essence, then to govern people below and serve Heaven above—hence it is said: *Governing people and serving Heaven—nothing surpasses frugality.*\n\nOnly frugality is called *early return* [早复].\n**Lü Jifu** says: *Only frugality preserves the spirit and essence without expending them, thus it is \"early return.\"* If one is not frugal and instead squanders, until the spirit is exhausted and the essence worn out, even if one wished to return to one’s original nature, there would be no way to enter it. Is this not too late?\n\nHence it is said: *Only frugality is called early return.*\n**Wang Yuanze** says: *When movement reaches its limit and stillness begins, then the return is late. Only frugality does not indulge in waste, for its departure from the root is never distant—thus, the return is early.*\n\n*Early return* is called *heavily accumulating virtue* [重积德].\n**Lü Jifu** says: *Humanity’s life is inherently sufficient through virtue. If one truly harmonizes and returns early, virtue will daily increase and fill.*\n\nHence it is said: *Early return is called heavily accumulating virtue.*\n**御注:** *To overcome is called \"conquer.\"*\n\nHeavily accumulating virtue, one conquers all—\n**Lü Jifu** says: *Heavily accumulating virtue means virtue reaches its utmost. The utmost virtue cannot be scorched by fire, drowned by water, harmed by cold or heat, or preyed upon by beasts. How can it not conquer all?*\n\nHence it is said: *Heavily accumulating virtue, one conquers all.*\n**御注:** *When virtue reaches its utmost, it is boundless in response—who can know its limit?*\n\nHeavily accumulating virtue, one conquers all—\n**Lü Jifu** says: *If there is something one cannot conquer, then the Dao/Way has its limits. If one conquers all, who can know its limit?*\n\nHence it is said: *Heavily accumulating virtue, one conquers all—then none can know its limit.*\n\nNone can know its limit—thus one can have a state [國].\n**御注:** *When one’s body is boundless, there is ample room to govern the world—how much more so to have a state?*\n\n**Lü Jifu** says: *One who holds land possesses a great thing. One who possesses a great thing cannot be constrained by things. To constrain yet not be constrained—thus one can constrain all things. None can know its limit, so one is not constrained yet can constrain all things. Even if one holds land, there will be no burden.*\n\nHence it is said: *None can know its limit—thus one can have a state.*\nThe mother of a lasting state—\n**御注:** *The Dao/Way is the mother of all things.*\n\nThose who follow the **Dao/Way** are unblemished through ten thousand generations. **Shu Wang** said: *\"States all arise from the **Dao/Way**, thus the **Dao/Way** is called the mother. If one abides by it, one’s life will not perish.\"*\n\nHence it is said: *\"Thus one can endure forever.\"*\n\nThis is called **deep-rooted and firmly anchored**—**Wang Yuanzhe** said: *\"Humans take **nature/xing** as their root; all else beyond this is but branches and leaves. Those who lose their **nature/xing**** overdevelop their branches and leaves to harm their root. When the root is injured, vital **qi** and essence decline, and the anchor is not firm—this is why they perish early.\"*\n\nOnly through **parsimony** can one avoid external harm to the root. When the root is deep, the anchor is firm; when the anchor is firm, one’s form remains bound to life, and separation is delayed.\n\n**Lu Tian** said: *\"When nothing can measure it—this is called **deep**. When nothing can topple it—this is called **firm**.\"*\n\nThe **Dao/Way** of long life and enduring vision—\n**御注:** The **Dao/Way** is the mother of all things. Things are its offspring. **Nature/xing** is the root of form; form is its trunk. Knowing its offspring and preserving its mother, one’s life will not perish, hence the enduring forever. When the root is deep, the trunk is firm; when **nature/xing** is preserved, the form remains whole. Aligning with Heaven and Earth as constants, one can thus achieve long life. With the sun and moon sharing their luminosity, one can thus endure vision forever. When humans and things transform yet the **Dao/Way** alone remains—this is called the **Dao/Way**.\"\n\n**Lü Jifu** said: *\"To practice **parsimony** as the **Dao/Way**—this is called **deep-rooted and firmly anchored**, the **Dao/Way** of long life and enduring vision. **Spirit/shen** is the root of life; if one hoards and preserves it, the root will be deep and life will endure. **Long life** is the anchor of vision; if one guards and protects it, the anchor will be firm and vision will last long. This chapter begins by saying that in governing people and harmonizing with Heaven, nothing surpasses **parsimony**, and concludes with the **Dao/Way** of long life and enduring vision. Indeed, the **Dao/Way** of enduring forever lies in conserving one’s **spirit/shen**. **Spirit/shen** is the root; form is the anchor. When the root is deep and the anchor is firm, life and vision endure forever.\"*\n\nIn ancient times, the Yellow Emperor asked about the **Dao/Way** of enduring forever, and Guangcheng instructed him: *\"Embrace the **spirit/shen** and remain still; your form will naturally rectify itself. Do not disturb your vital **qi**—then you may achieve long life.\"* The *Inner Canon* states of the **True Person/zhenren**: *\"Inhaling and exhaling vital **qi**, standing alone to guard the **spirit/shen**, thus one’s lifespan can compare to Heaven and Earth, without end.\"* Speaking of the **Perfect One/zhi** it says: *\"Accumulate **jing/essence** and preserve **shen/spirit**.\"* Speaking of the **Sage/shengren** it says: *\"The **spirit/shen** does not scatter.\"* Examining from ancient times to the present, no **True Sage/upper sage** has ever achieved perfection without conserving their **spirit/shen**.*\n\nAs for the people of today’s age, they exhaust their **jing/essence** with desire and dissipate their **True Self/zhen** through wastefulness. They do not know how to maintain fullness nor to govern the **spirit/shen** at the proper time. They lose their **jing/essence** and **ling/soul**, their form declines, and they perish early—how can this be the **Dao/Way**?\"\n\nHence it is said: *\"The **Dao/Way** is what the **Sage/shengren** practices; the foolish turn away from it.\"* **Daoist Canon/True Classic of Dao and Virtue**—*Collection of the Good, Volume Nine* concludes. *Collection of the Good, Volume Ten* concludes.\n\n**Collection of the Master Li Lin of Song’s Residence in Rao: Chapter Sixty – Governing a Great Realm**\n\nGoverning a great realm is like cooking a small fresh fish.\n*Commentary:* Stirring a small fresh fish too often causes it to break apart.\nTo govern a great realm with frequent changes in law brings confusion.\n\nThus, the **Dao/Way** of governance values tranquility, and the people settle themselves.\nWang Bi says: *\"It means not to disturb.\"*\n\nAgitation brings many harms; stillness preserves the **True Self/zhen**.\nHence, the greater the realm, the more tranquil its ruler must be—only then can he broadly win the hearts of the people.\n\nLiu Zhongping says: *\"For the greatest of realms, governance should be as simple as cooking a small fresh fish. Why? Because it avoids unnecessary disturbance.*\nA small fish is easily ruined by overhandling.\nA weak people are easily troubled by interference.\nThe cook of a small fresh fish lets it cook itself.\nThe ruler of a great realm lets the people govern themselves.\n\nThe **Classic** says: *\"I do nothing, yet the people transform themselves; I love stillness, yet the people align themselves.\"*\n\nTo govern the world with the **Dao/Way**, its spirits are not numinous.\nLu Zhan says: *\"Ghosts and spirits, when unsettled and restless, manifest as calamities.*\nThe ancients who governed the world with the **Dao/Way**—even birds, beasts, fish, and turtles, as well as mountains, rivers, and ghosts—all found peace, and thus there were no ominous portents.\"\n\nWang Yuanze says: *\"When the people are undisturbed, they fulfill their nature.*\nWhen the people fulfill their nature, the harmony of Heaven and Earth responds, and all things flourish without hindrance.\nThus, even ghosts find peace in their place and cannot become numinous.\"\n\nWhen humans and ghosts follow different **Dao/Way**s yet often clash, it is because the **qi** of yin and yang is disordered, and their proper balance is lost—thus, spirits exploit the opportunity.\n\nThough the world is vast, true governance lies in the **Dao/Way**, which acts without action and trusts in spontaneity.\nTo govern a great realm is like cooking a small fresh fish—this is called governing the world with the **Dao/Way**.\nThus, the **qi** of yin and yang remains harmonious, and humans and ghosts each dwell in peace—hence, *\"its spirits are not numinous.\"*\n\nNot that its spirits are without numen—rather, they do not harm the people.\nEmperor Xuanzong of Tang says: *\"The saying ‘its spirits are not numinous’ does not mean ghosts vanish or lose their numen; it means their numen does not manifest as malevolence to harm people.\"*\n\nNot that their numen does not harm the people—rather, the Sage does not harm the people.\nLiu Jinxi says: *\"Numen is the manifestation of spiritual efficacy.*\nThese ghosts lack such efficacy, but when a ruler governs with the **Dao/Way**, the spirits bless the people and cannot harm them.\nTo govern a great realm is like cooking a small fresh fish—this is called the Sage not harming the people.\n\nOnly the Sage does not harm the people, so Heaven and Earth’s harmony responds, and humans and ghosts each fulfill their nature without mutual harm.\nWhen neither harms the other, **virtue/power** naturally returns.\n\n*Commentary:* *\"To govern the world with the **Dao/Way** is to act without action, letting things follow their nature, avoiding war and capital punishment—this is called not harming the people.*\nAt such times, spirits and people do not harm each other, and **virtue/power** returns.\nThe spirits do not manifest their numen—only blessings abound.\nThus it is said: ‘Its numen does not harm the people; the people have no need to exert their cleverness.’\nTheir daily lives are but eating and drinking—what harm could there be?\nThis chapter urges rulers to govern the world with the **Dao/Way**, acting without action and trusting in spontaneity, so that the subtle and manifest each dwell in their place, and humans and spirits do not interfere with one another, while **virtue/power** returns.\n\nIn the time of Emperor Yao, celestial communications ceased, and no spirits descended.\nIn the age of the Xia, mountains, rivers, and ghosts all found peace.\nThis was the **Sage** governing the world without action.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-One – Great Realms Are Like the Lower Reaches**\n\nGreat realms are like the lower reaches [of a river].\nHe Shangong says: *\"To govern a great realm, one must be like the river and sea dwelling in the lower reaches, not resisting the smallest currents.\"*\n\nWang Bi says: *\"The river and sea are vast yet dwell low, so all streams flow to them.\nA great realm is vast yet dwells low, so all under Heaven turns to it—thus, great realms are like the lower reaches.\"*\n\nLu Jifu says: *\"If one knows to govern with the **Dao/Way**, one certainly does not harm the people.\nBut if one does not know how to win the world, then even if one does not harm the people, others may harm them.\nGreat realms are like the lower reaches—the gathering place of the world.\nThe world’s gathering place is receptive, like the female.\nThe female always overcomes the male through stillness, and stillness is humility—this is the way to win the world and preserve the people.\n\nThe world’s gathering place.\nWang Bi says: *\"Where all under Heaven converges—an assembly.\"*\n\nEmperor Xuanzong of Tang says: *\"The lower reaches signify the **virtue/power** of humility.\nA great realm, by dwelling low and opening itself, invites all under Heaven to gather.\n\nThe world’s gathering place is receptive, like the female.\nWang Bi says: *\"Still and not seeking, yet all come of their own accord.\"*\n\nWang Yuanze says: *\"One should receive all with feminine stillness.*\nThe female always overcomes the male through stillness.\nHe Shangong says: *\"Yin overcomes yang by being tranquil and not seeking first.\"*\n\nStillness is humility.\nWang Bi says: *\"Because of its stillness, it can be humble.*\nThe female is the receptive.\nThe male is restless, consumed by desire; the female is always still, thus overcoming the male.\nBecause of its stillness, it can also be humble, and thus all things turn to it.\"*\n\nDuke Shū of Shu says: *\"Gathering is the assembly of the people; if one can endure what the people dislike, then all movements of the world will turn to it.\nThus it is said: ‘The world’s gathering place is receptive’—for the world’s gathering is but the gathering of the receptive.\nThe receptive always overcomes the active through stillness, and stillness is humility—thus, stillness is the ruler, and always dwelling low, it is sufficient to overcome the active.\nThus it is said: ‘With stillness, it overcomes the active; with stillness, it is humble.’\n\nLu Jifu says: *\"The world’s gathering place is receptive, and the receptive always overcomes the active through stillness—yet what allows it to overcome is its humility through stillness.\nThus, great realms, by dwelling low over small realms, take the small realms.\nWang Bi says: *\"‘Great realms dwell low’—meaning even great realms dwell low over small realms, and the small realms attach to them.\"*\n\nGu Huan said: *\"When great realms are humble with emptiness, then small realms rejoice and submit. Their submission is how one takes those small realms. When small realms submit to great realms, they take the great realms.\"*\n\nHeshang Gong said: *\"This means that regardless of a realm’s size, if it practices humility and nurtures others, it will have no faults.\"*\n\nWang Bi said: *\"The great realm receives them.\"*\n\nLu Yu said: *\"It takes them because they accommodate it.\"*\n\nEmperor Xuanzong of Tang said: *\"The great takes the small to make them subjects and servants. The small takes the great to seek aid.\"*\n\nThus, sometimes one submits to take, and sometimes one submits while taking.\n\nEmperor Xuanzong of Tang said: *\"‘With’ means the great takes the small, ‘while’ means the small takes the great.\"*\n\nLu Jifu said: *\"Thus, when great realms submit to small realms, they take the small realms—this is what is meant by ‘sometimes submitting to take.’ Submitting to take means that though the great could dominate the small, it submits to take them. When small realms submit to great realms, they take the great realms—this is what is meant by ‘sometimes submitting while taking.’ Submitting while taking means that though the small cannot avoid submitting to the great, they do so to take them.\"*\n\nKing Xuan of Qi asked: *\"Is there a Way to interact with neighboring realms?\"*\n\nMencius replied: *\"There is. Only the virtuous can serve the small with the great, hence Tang served Ge and King Wen served Kunyi. Only the wise can serve the great with the small, hence Taiwang served Xiányú and Goujian served Wu. Serving the small with the great is the act of one who rejoices in Heaven’s order. Serving the great with the small is the act of one who fears Heaven’s order. Those who rejoice in Heaven’s order preserve all under Heaven, while those who fear it preserve only their own realm.\"*\n\nGreat realms seek only to encompass and nurture others.\n\nHeshang Gong said: *\"If great realms do not lose their humility, they will encompass and nurture small realms.\"*\n\nCheng Xuan Ying said: *\"The reason great realms practice humility is that they have no ulterior motives—they seek only to love and nurture small realms.\"*\n\nSmall realms seek only to submit and serve others.\n\nLiu Jinxi said: *\"When small realms use gentleness, they have no hidden intentions—they seek only to enter the great realm’s embrace, admiring its virtue and serving it.\"*\n\nEmperor Xuanzong of Tang said: *\"When great realms hold to the virtue of humility and submit to small realms, they seek only to encompass and nurture small realms as subjects and servants. When small realms offer tribute and submit to great realms, they seek only to serve the great as allies. Both parties thus obtain what they desire, hence the great should submit.\"*\n\nLiu Qihui said: *\"Those who rely on greatness risk arrogance, so this is a special warning.\"*\n\nShu Wang said: *\"It is easy for the small to serve the great, but difficult for the great to serve the small. Since this is what is difficult for people, Laozi says the great should submit.\"*\n\nLu Jifu said: *\"Now, the great submits to the small, and the small submits to the great—each obtains what it desires. Then who would not take? ‘Taking’ means winning their hearts without losing them. Yet if the great should not submit, and only the great is said to submit, why? If the small cannot submit to the great, not only will it fail to take the great realm, but disaster will befall it. Thus, even if it seems unfit, it is said: ‘The great should submit.’ The great, encompassing the four seas and ruling all under Heaven, holds a lofty position and exalted rank. If it falls into excess and fullness, it is especially prone to arrogance. Thus, it must practice humility.\"*\n\nLiuzi said: *\"Heaven’s Way is to descend and illuminate, and seas and rivers rule by descending. Mountains are humble when rooted in the earth, and kings and lords consider solitude and poverty as detriments. This chapter speaks of the Way to interact with neighboring realms, taking humility as its foundation. Thus, regardless of size, all realms should practice humility. The great must especially fear arrogance, hence the special warning.\"*\n\n---\n**Chapter Sixty-Two: Dao as the Mysterious Origin of All Things**\n\nDao is the mysterious origin of all things.\n\nLiu Zhongping said: *\"Mysterious\" refers to the deepest dwelling. \"Border\" refers to a narrow edge. When speaking of Dao’s subtlety, it is likened to the mysterious. When speaking of Dao’s coarseness, it is likened to the border. Speaking of subtlety reveals the border’s coarseness; speaking of the border reveals subtlety’s mystery.*\n\nThe treasure of the virtuous.\n\nEmperor Xuanzong of Tang said: *\"The virtuous know that those who guard Dao prosper, so they always treasure and value it for use.\"*\n\nWang Yuanzhe said: *\"The treasure of the virtuous is what the Sage embodies. Under Heaven, nothing is more valued than Dao. Those who know Dao’s value are the virtuous. ‘Treasure’ means precious and honored. Dao as treasure is the essence of vital breath and spirit. Vital essence is the foundation of the body—preserving it without dissipation ensures the body’s completeness. Concentrating qi without recklessness ensures the body’s fullness. Guarding the spirit without scattering ensures the body’s perfection. The three merge as one—this is why Dao is the virtuous’ treasure.\"*\n\nThe non-virtuous’ reliance.\n\nEmperor Xuanzong of Tang said: *\"‘Reliance’ means ‘to depend upon.’ The non-virtuous cannot treasure Dao, but when facing peril, they seek to preserve themselves by relying on Dao to escape.\"*\n\nNothing is not Dao—\nthe virtuous seek it to attain virtue,\nthe non-virtuous rely on it to avoid ruin.\n\nSun Deng said: *\"Fine words can elevate one’s reputation above all goods, and conduct can place one above others. Yet Dao, when spoken, is as insipid as water. The Sage acts without doing, teaches without speaking—how could he adorn speech to please the people’s ears or embellish conduct to dazzle all things?\"*\n\nLu Tian said: *\"‘Words’ refers to wind and waves; ‘conduct’ refers to ruin.\"*\n\nYet even fine words can command esteem, and virtuous conduct can elevate one above others—how much more so is Dao the profound essence of all things! This is why the ancients employed this Dao to awaken the people.\n\nWhen even one person is enlightened by it, though one were to fill the Dharma-realm with the most precious treasures and distribute them all, no merit could surpass this.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"Fine words can command esteem,\nvirtuous conduct can elevate one above others.\nWhat reason would the unvirtuous have to abandon it?\"*\n\nTherefore, the Son of Heaven is established, and the Three Exalted Ministers are appointed.\n\nGu Huan said:\n*\"To establish the sovereign and set up ministers,\nto discuss Dao and govern the state—\nthis is to lead the world by Dao,\nto teach and transform the unvirtuous.\"*\n\nDu Guangting said:\n*\"The vastness of the Four Seas,\nthe wealth of myriad things—\nfrom the first emergence of the people,\nthere must be no ruler without authority.\nThus the Son of Heaven is established to shepherd them.\nThe Son of Heaven honors the Supreme Deity,\nserves Heaven as a son,\nserves Earth as a mother—\nthis is called the Son of Heaven.\nOne person cannot govern broadly,\nso the chiefs of a hundred officials are appointed,\namong whom are the Three Exalted Ministers.\nThe *Book of Documents* says:\n‘These are the Three Exalted Ministers,\ndiscussing Dao and governing the state.’\nThe Three Exalted Ministers are the Grand Teacher, Grand Tutor, and Grand Guardian.\nWen Gong said:\n‘The sovereign is established to oversee and shepherd the people,\nministers are appointed to instruct and safeguard the sovereign.\nEven with a jade tablet held before four horses,\nit is not as good as advancing this Dao.\nThe Imperial Commentary says:\n*The noble person’s cultivation of self brings peace to the world.*\nWhen the Son of Heaven and the Three Exalted Ministers\nuse jade tablets and four-horse carriages to attract the worthy,\nbut do not strive to advance Dao and cultivate themselves,\nthey abandon self-governance for others,\nlosing the Way of self-regulation.\nIt is better to simply advance this Dao within oneself.\nWhere Dao resides, the Sage holds it in highest honor,\nso the people follow it as they flock to market.\nShu Wang said:\n‘Though one may hold a jade tablet the width of two hands\nand lead four horses to welcome the worthy,\nit is still not as good as simply advancing this Dao.’\nWang Yuanzhe said:\n‘The Son of Heaven and the Three Exalted Ministers\ntake the transformation of the people as their duty.\nIf they possess Dao, the world will naturally submit.\nJade tablets and four-horse carriages are used to attract the worthy—\nthis is the greatest of governance.\nEven if the worthy are obtained,\nif Dao is not advanced, the people will still not submit.\nThus it is better not to seek externally but to grasp the essence of Dao.’\n\nThis is the threefold explanation of using jade tablets and four-horse carriages to attract the worthy.\n\nLü Jifu said:\n‘Therefore, the Son of Heaven is established,\nand the Three Exalted Ministers are appointed.\nEven with a jade tablet held before four horses,\nthese are the rites of respect and the weight of offerings for the sovereign.\nYet it is still not as good as advancing this Dao while seated,\nfor Dao is the most honored in the world—\neven if advanced while seated,\nit surpasses respectful rites and heavy offerings.\nThe Son of Heaven and the Three Exalted Ministers\ndiscuss Dao while seated—\nthis is all there is to it.’\n\nThis explains how jade tablets and four-horse carriages are used to honor the sovereign.\n\nWhy did the ancients hold this Dao in such high regard?\nGu Huan said:\n‘Why did the ancients value this Dao so highly?\nWhat was their reasoning?\nWas it not because seeking brings attainment,\nand guilt is thereby absolved?\nThus it is the most honored in the world.’\n\nThe Imperial Commentary says:\n‘Seeking brings attainment—\nthis is seeking within oneself.\nThe ancients sought it in yin-yang and numerology\nbut did not attain it,\nfor they sought externally.\nThe wicked become virtuous,\nthe foolish become wise—\nthis is how guilt is absolved.\nSuch is the power of Dao to save,\nand thus it is the most honored in the world.’\n\nThe *Transmission* says:\n‘There is nothing in the world more honored than Dao.’\n\nLü Jifu said:\n‘Seeking brings attainment—\nthis is the treasure of the virtuous.\nGuilt is absolved—\nthis is the refuge of the unvirtuous.\nBecause of this,\nDao is the most honored in the world,\nand thus the ancients could not help but honor it.’\n\nThis chapter speaks of all things arising from Dao,\nand Dao being the most honored in the world.\nThose who practice it virtuously are the virtuous.\n\nThus it is said:\n‘Seeking brings attainment,\nand those who preserve and entrust it are the common people.\nGuilt is absolved—\nfor Dao is never without use,\nand thus it is the most honored in the world.’\n\n---\n**Chapter 63: *For Non-Action***\n\nTo act without acting,\nto manage without managing,\nto savor without savoring.\n\nThe Imperial Commentary says:\n‘The nature of Dao is without doing, hence non-action;\nwithout form, hence no managing;\nwithout desire, hence no savoring.\nThe Sage responds to things as they are,\nwhile embodying the non-being of Dao—\nhere, the three are clearly seen.’\n\nLiu Jinxi said:\n‘To act without acting—\nthis is cultivating Dao’s work.\nTo manage without managing—\nthis is perceiving Dao’s form.\nTo savor without savoring—\nthis is penetrating Dao’s principles.\nNon-action is Dao’s constant.\nNo managing is Dao’s true nature.\nNo savoring is Dao’s simplicity.\nThese three are all Dao itself.’\n\nGreat or small, many or few—\nrepaying enmity with virtue.\n\nThe Imperial Commentary says:\n‘Great and small refer to form,\nmany and few refer to quantity—\nthings are boundless, beyond measure.\nGreat yet not excessive,\nsmall yet not deficient—\nthen the repayment of enmity and gratitude,\nwho can distinguish them?\nThus the Sage unifies all things in the One,\nand accomplishes the great.’\n\nWang Yuanzhe said:\n‘To repay enmity with enmity is a matter of action.\nTo repay enmity with virtue is virtue itself.\nAction shares in fortune and misfortune with the people,\nthus all methods must be employed without omission.\nBut virtue is unseen—\nhow could enmity arise?\nAs for the three matters above,\nthese are the embodiment of Dao.\nWhen embodying Dao,\nit must be thus.\nIf one speaks of enmity yet repays with virtue,\nthen one knows virtue pervades all things.’\n\nCao Daochong said:\n‘Repaying enmity with virtue extinguishes enmity.\nRepaying enmity with enmity leads to endless retaliation.\nDifficulties arise from what is easy,\nthe great from what is small.’\n\nZuan Wei said:\n‘This is a grave warning.\nDifficult and easy, great and small—\nthese are the uppermost categories of greatness and multitude.\nRight and wrong, beauty and ugliness,\nenmity and gratitude—\nall arise from subtle beginnings,\nnone without first being easy,\nthen becoming difficult,\nfirst small,\nthen great.’\n\nNow if one plans for difficulties when they are still easy,\nthen at the end, there will be no hardship.\nIf one acts on small beginnings while they are still small,\nthen later there will be no greatness.\n\nBut if one waits until difficulties have already arisen to address them,\nor undertakes great tasks when they are already great,\nthen resentment and anger will deepen while calamities accumulate—\nand when one seeks to resolve difficulties and untangle chaos,\nhow could it not be difficult?\n\nThe seeds of disaster lie hidden in the subtle and minute,\nmanifesting where ordinary people fail to notice.\nBy the time they take root,\neven the wise cannot remedy the consequences.\n\nThus, when resentment arises,\none must attend to it while it is still easy and small,\nand then there will be no resentment.\n\nThe *Classic of Documents* says:\n*\"Resentment does not lie in what is obvious—\nit is unseen when one fails to act early.\"*\n\nGreat undertakings in the world\nmust begin with what is easy.\nGreat affairs in the world\nmust begin with what is small.\n\n**Commentary:**\n*A thousand-zhang dike collapses from the burrow of an ant;\na hundred-foot hall burns from a crack’s smoke.*\nWhite Gui sealed the dike’s holes when building it,\nso there was no water disaster.\nThe aged craftsman sealed the gaps when tending the fire,\nso there was no fire calamity.\n\nAll things under heaven\nbegin from the most minute origins,\nyet by the time they reach their end,\nthey cannot be easily managed.\n\nThus, the Sage acts early.\n\n**Commentary by Cui (疏):**\n*\"Action\"* means *\"to arise.\"* This elaborates on how calamities originate.\nDifficult matters must arise from what is easy, so one must address them while they are still easy.\nGreat affairs must arise from what is minute, so one must eliminate them while they are still small.\nTheir instances are indeed numerous and cannot be exhaustively listed.\nHence, the summary is given as *\"all under heaven.\"*\n\nDu Guangting (杜光庭) said:\n*\"To prevent disaster before its signs appear,\nto cut off calamity before its sprouting—\nthis is the utmost caution.\"*\n\nThus, the Sage never undertakes what is difficult and great,\nand therefore is able to achieve what is great.\n\n**Imperial Commentary (御注):**\n*\"If one acts while things are small,\nthen one can achieve what is great.*\nIf disorder has already formed and is then addressed,\nis it not too late?\"\n\nEmperor Xuanzong of Tang (唐明皇) said:\n*\"The earlier rulers often undertook what was difficult and great,\nso they planned and eliminated it.*\nThis shows that the Sage does not undertake what is difficult and great,\nand thus is able to achieve what is great.\"*\n\n**On light promises:**\nCheng Xuanying (成玄英) said:\n*\"This is an illustrative analogy.*\n*'Promise'* means *'to assent.'*\n*'Few'* means *'little.'*\nThose who lightly assent to others\nwill necessarily have little sincerity in their words.\"*\n\nDu Guangting said:\n*\"Yang Wu had no second thoughts in his commands,\nZilu had no lingering promises—\nthe ancients praised them thus.\"*\n\n*The Records* say:\n*\"Better to have no promises to break\nthan to incur personal resentment.\"*\n\n**On excessive ease:**\nEmperor Xuanzong of Tang said:\n*\"Lightly promising others will result in few fulfilled words.\nFrequent ease in action will inevitably lead to many difficulties.\"*\n\nCheng Xuanying said:\n*\"This is the resolution of the analogy.*\nThose who lightly commit offenses\nwill necessarily invite grave retribution.\"*\n\nLuoshi (罗什) said:\n*\"If one acts lightly without restraint,\nthe retribution will necessarily be severe.\"*\n\nThus, the Sage still finds difficulty in such matters,\nand therefore never faces great difficulty.\n\n**Imperial Commentary:**\n*\"Disaster is often hidden in what is minute,\nyet erupts when people overlook it.*\nThe Sage’s response to the world\nis always to be cautious of the minute and never negligent,\nso from the start there are no light or easy actions,\nand thus great, unmanageable calamities are ultimately avoided.*\n\nAll this is without cause.\n\nWang Bi (王弼) said:\n*\"Even the Sage finds difficulty in what is minute and easy.\nHow much more so for those not of the Sage’s caliber,\nwho would dare to neglect this?\"*\nHence it is said:\n*\"The Sage still finds it difficult,\"*\nfor it is because of the difficulty in what is minute and easy\nthat there are ultimately no great difficulties.\n\nLiu Renhui (刘仁会) said:\n*\"To deliberate before acting\nis to avoid regret and hesitation.*\nThe Sage acts thus—how much more so for others?\"*\n\nThis chapter’s three matters embody the Dao.\nThus, repaying resentment with virtue\nis to address it while it is still easy and small,\nand therefore there are no great difficulties.\nWithout embodying the Dao, who could be like the Sage?\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Four: On Ease and Firmness in Holding** *(其安易持)*\n\nDu Guangting said:\n*\"Those born with a naturally tranquil nature,\nwhose desires have yet to sprout—\nto approach and uphold them is easy to grasp.\nWhat has not yet manifested is easy to plan.\"*\n\nEmperor Xuanzong of Tang said:\n*\"When a person’s true nature remains tranquil,\nand one seeks to hold it steady,\npreventing its scattering—\nthough the mind may stir,\nits form and intent have not yet taken shape or measure,\nso to suppress it is most effortless.\"*\n\nWang Yuanzhe said:\n*\"Discipline must come before the deed arises.\nWhat is fragile is easily shattered;\nwhat is subtle is easily dispersed.\"*\n\nEmperor Xuanzong of Tang said:\n*\"When wicked intent first takes root,\nit is still frail and perilous—\nthose who sever it find it easily broken.\nWhen calamity first arises,\nits signs are still faint—\nto forestall it, what is faint is easily dispersed.\"*\n\nLü Jifu said:\n*\"What is fragile is easily shattered—\nso one must not let it harden.\nWhat is subtle is easily dispersed—\nso one must not let it take root.\nAll things are thus, but the mind is most so.\nIf this is applied to the mind,\nthen all under Heaven and the state will face no difficulty.\"*\n\nWang Yuanzhe said:\n*\"To act at the very beginning of what has already arisen—\nthis is called ‘ordering before chaos takes hold,\nacting before it exists,\ngoverning before disorder arises.’\"*\n\nYan Zun said:\n*\"Before sickness strikes, the patient is easy to heal.\nBefore a state is in peril, its counsel is easy to devise.\nWhen troubles are but sprouts, they are easy to address.\nWhen misfortunes are still weak, they are easy to avert.\nHow may this be demonstrated?\nA cart’s axle unbroken, a child can guide it.\nBut when it topples—\noverturned and crashing into valleys—\na thousand men cannot right it.\nBefore the egg is cracked,\na finger’s touch may halt it.\nBut once it becomes a flying swan,\nflapping wings toward the clouds,\nno net or snare can ensnare it.\nA tree thick enough to embrace\nbegins as a hair’s tip.\nA nine-tiered tower\nrises from a single clod of earth.\nA thousand-li journey\ncommences beneath one’s feet.\"*\n\n**Commentary:**\n*\"All things with form—\nthe great must grow from the small,\nthe high must be founded on the low,\nthe distant must begin with the near.\nIn their inception, they are simple;\nwhen complete, they are vast.\nThe Sage perceives the beginning and contemplates,\ndiscerns the end before the finger moves—\nthus he does not act before fortune arrives,\nnor does he begin before calamity takes hold.\nHe deliberates before acting,\nand thus achieves success.\"*\n\nEmperor Xuanzong of Tang said:\n*\"This speaks of how evil arises from the subtle\nand solidifies when it takes root.\nLike a tree thick enough to embrace,\nwhich begins as a hair’s tip—\nthis shows how it grows from its own nature.\nA nine-tiered tower,\nbuilt from a single clod of earth—\nthis shows how habits accumulate.\nA thousand-li journey,\nstarting with a single step—\nthis shows how distant paths are traversed without pause.\nThus, all under Heaven’s affairs\ntruly begin with the minute and subtle,\nyet people often neglect them,\nand so their roots become disasters.\nHence, three analogies are offered to confirm the foregoing.\"*\n\nDu Guangting said:\n*\"People do not guard against what is nascent,\nstates do not heed what is subtle.\nWhen disaster manifests, they seek to remove it;\nwhen chaos is complete, they seek to govern it—\nthese are all failures of foresight.\nFrom a hair’s tip to a tree thick enough to embrace,\nit grows from small to great.\nFrom a clod of earth to a nine-tiered tower,\nit rises from low to high.\nFrom a single step to a thousand-li journey,\nit extends from near to far.\nYet men of the world,\nseeing only the towering tree, the lofty tower, the distant path,\nonly then wish to wield the axe to fell it,\npile up the pickaxes to demolish it,\nor gallop to chase it—\ntheir labor is extreme, yet the calamity cannot be undone.\nIt is like leaning against the market gate and singing,\nyet bringing ruin to the Jin dynasty.\nOr like presenting the Sandalwood Deer,\nnearly toppling the Han house.\nSilent foresight and distant discernment—\nthese are what one must attend to with utmost care.\nTo act is to court ruin;\nto grasp is to lose.\"*\n\n「Emperor Tang Minghuang said: *\"For\"* means to labor and contrive. *\"Execute\"* means to cling and fixate.\nHe spoke of how people cannot act before things arise nor govern before chaos ensues,\nyet instead contrive labor beyond their natural inclinations and fixate upon the dusty realms of the world,\nthus inevitably inviting calamity and suffering loss.\n\n Lü Jifu said: To act before things arise is to not truly act in accordance with *for*.\n To govern before chaos ensues is to not truly govern in accordance with *treat*.\n Once things exist and one acts upon them, desiring their completion only to bring about their ruin.\n Once disorder has arisen and one governs it, clinging to it only to lose it in the end.\n\n Therefore, the Sage does nothing and thus meets no defeat,\n holds nothing and thus suffers no loss.\n\n *Imperial Commentary*: The Sage does not engage in worldly affairs,\n thus meets no defeat. He does not cling to anything as his own,\n thus suffers no loss. The more one deviates from the Dao/Way,\n the farther one strays from its rules. Can one truly avoid ruin and loss?\n\n Lü Jifu said: Thus, the Sage acts before things arise,\n yet does so through *non-action* (*wúwéi*), and so meets no defeat.\n Governs before chaos ensues,\n yet does so through *non-execution* (*wúzhí*), and so suffers no loss.\n The common folk, in their pursuits,\n often reach near completion only to meet ruin.\n\n *Imperial Commentary*: To halt midway, abandon halfway through, or begin with vigor only to end in slackness—\n these are the ways of the common folk, and none can escape them.\n Thus, their affairs often reach near completion only to fail.\n Lü Jifu said: The common folk, in their pursuits,\n act only after things have already arisen,\n thus reaching near completion only to meet ruin—\n for they do not know their fundamental nature.\n\n When the common folk reach near completion yet fail,\n it is because they do not heed their final steps.\n The *Book of Documents* says: *\"To build a mountain nine *rèn* high,\n yet fail by one basket’s worth of earth.\"*\n To be as careful at the end as at the beginning,\n then there will be no ruined affairs.\n\n *Imperial Commentary*: Few can maintain their beginning to the end.\n To renew each moment as the start,\n applying this to affairs—\n what is there that cannot be accomplished?\n\n Emperor Tang Minghuang said: If one is vigilant in the final stages,\n ever preserving the mind of goodness from the start,\n then there will surely be no calamity or ruin.\n\n Lü Jifu said: If one knows that greatness arises from smallness,\n height from lowliness, and distance from proximity,\n and remains as careful at the end as at the beginning—\n how could there be any ruined affairs?\n\n Therefore, the Sage desires without desiring,\n does not prize goods that are hard to obtain,\n studies without studying,\n and corrects the errors of the common folk.\n\n *Imperial Commentary*: Those who seek profit exchange their nature for material things,\n and those who study diligently drown their hearts in trivial pursuits.\n How could this ever approach *non-action*?\n\n The Sage does not burden his form with profit,\n desiring only in *non-desire* (*bùyù*).\n Nurturing both self and others is complete when stopped,\n thus he does not prize goods that are hard to obtain.\n He does not extinguish the heavenly in himself for worldly gain,\n studying only in *non-study* (*bùxué*—\n cultivating brightness and harmony without contrivance),\n thus correcting the errors of the common folk.\n\n When the Dao/Way is not illuminated,\n even the worthy err in it—\n how much more so the common folk?\n To correct their errors and return them to their true nature—\n this is how scholars without worries find joy.\n\n Lü Zhi said: To discard gold as though it were mountain soil,\n to cast pearls into the abyss,\n to abandon the treasures of *extreme authenticity* (*jízhēn*),\n to sever the tools of exhausting skill (*qióngqiǎo*),\n this is what is meant by *desiring without desiring*.\n To forget about benevolence and righteousness,\n to abandon ritual and music,\n to cast aside the stale dregs of old teachings,\n to throw away the rotten husks of false doctrine—\n this is what is meant by *studying without studying*.\n\n Wang Yuanzé said: *Desiring without desiring* is not the absence of desire,\n but desire lies in *non-desire*—\n thus he does not prize goods that are hard to obtain.\n When the people have food to eat and warm clothing,\n these are necessities of their nature—\n to desire no more than this is not to have desire,\n yet after satisfying these needs, to further covet hard-to-obtain goods—\n this is the delusion of the foolish masses,\n straying far from their fundamental nature.\n\n Therefore, the Sage desires without desiring,\n to rescue them from their delusion and return them to their true nature.\n *Studying without studying* is not the absence of learning,\n but what is learned lies in *non-study*—\n to correct the errors of the common folk.\n\n The common folk chase trivial ends and engage in endless affairs,\n while the Sage, through *non-study* that corrects their errors,\n returns them to the Dao/Way.\n To assist the natural unfolding of all things,\n yet dare not to act.\n\n Lu Yu said: *Assist* means *aid*.\n Man is born in stillness—\n this is the nature of things.\n With *non-desire* and *non-study*,\n aiding the natural unfolding of all things,\n letting each fulfill its nature,\n yet daring not to act—\n what is there to do?\n It does not disrupt their inherent order,\n nor go against their natural inclinations.\n To aid their arising when they arise,\n to aid their form when they take shape—\n this is how the officials of *You* (有虞) managed affairs,\n and how the virtuous power of *Xia* (有夏) brought harmony to birds, beasts, fish, and tortoises.\n\n This passage speaks of how the Sage addresses difficulty in its ease.\n Thus, he holds fast in times of tranquility—\n this is what is meant by *acting before things arise*.\n He establishes order in moments of fragility—\n this is what is meant by *governing before chaos ensues*.」\n\n«Take three matters as analogies. If one seeks to forestall future hardship by acting early, one must act without interference and without grasping—then all will be well. The Sage does not wish to still the people with *non-action* (无为) or to cut off learning with *non-study* (无忧), but rather to assist all things in their natural unfolding, thus embodying the Dao of *non-action*. Only then can one maintain ease in tranquility and avoid the burden of future difficulty.\n\nThe ancient masters who excelled in the Way did not seek to enlighten the people, but rather to keep them simple. *Commentary*: The people can be guided, but cannot be made to know.\n\nThe ancient masters who excelled in the Way merely led them.\n\nTo reverse their natural inclinations, the Way can be carried out, yet when one acts with them, no cleverness or artifice is needed.\n\nThus it is said: To keep the Three Dynasties and those below in simplicity, to release the unadorned *non-action* (恬惔无为), and to delight in the harmonious and plain (咛哼之意), bending and folding ritual and music to rectify the forms of the world, sighing and breathing forth virtue and righteousness to soothe the hearts of the people—this was done to enlighten them.\n\nThough called *governance* (治之), what greater chaos could there be?\n\nWang Bi said: *Enlightenment* (明) means excessive perception and craftiness, dispersing their simplicity.\n\n*Simplicity* (愚) means having no knowledge to guard, following nature.\n\nWen Gong said: To remove ornamentation and pursue reality, to return to purity and simplicity.\n\nCao Dao Chong said: When the people are clever, deceit arises; when the people are simple, they return to purity.\n\nThe enlightened one enlights the people with his cleverness, but not to enlighten them—that is what is meant by *not governing the state with cleverness*.\n\n*Simplicity* is the opposite of cleverness; one seeks to keep the people simple, making them abandon cleverness and return to purity, forgetting distinctions, severing good and evil, and aligning with the state of *no knowledge, no desire*.\n\nThe difficulty of governing the people lies in their cleverness being too great.\n\nShu Wang said: The Sage’s cleverness is a state’s beneficial tool.\n\nThe ancient masters who excelled in the Way did not display their Sage’s cleverness to the people, but rather sought to keep them simple, without knowledge or desire.\n\nThus, Zhuangzi said: If the ruler truly loves cleverness yet lacks the Way, then the world will fall into great disorder.\n\nHow do we know this to be true? The more cunning the bows, crossbows, and snares are, the more the birds are disordered above. The more intricate the hooks, baits, nets, and traps, the more the fish are disordered in the water. The more refined the fences, enclosures, and traps, the more the beasts are disordered in the marshes. The more varied the clever distinctions of *allowing, gradual, poisonous, slippery, firm, white, resolving filth, and harmonizing differences*, the more the people are bewildered by sophistry.\n\nThus, the world often falls into great disorder, and the blame lies with the love of cleverness. Cleverness leads to deceit; simplicity leads to no knowledge. When the people are filled with clever deceit, cunning and falsehood flourish, making governance difficult.\n\nThus, governing the state with cleverness is the state’s ruin.\n\nLu Yu said: To uphold the Way and employ cleverness is to give rise to great falsehood.\n\nFalsehood arises from below, cleverness from above; when the two deceive each other, the harm is great.\n\nTang Ming Huang said: *With* (以) means *to use*; *ruin* (贼) means *harm*. When a ruler employs clever ministers to govern the state, cleverness must inevitably produce laws. Laws bring forth deceit, and orders give rise to cunning, which is why the state grows increasingly corrupt and cleverness becomes the state’s ruin.\n\nCao Can guarded the law, yet the Han prospered through him; Shang Jun altered the law, yet Qin declined through him. Thus, the *Classic* above says: *When cleverness and wisdom arise, great falsehood follows*—this is the case.\n\nSu Zi You said: I govern others with my cleverness; they also respond with their cleverness. Thus, the ruler and people deceive each other, and the harm is great.\n\nNot governing the state with cleverness is the state’s blessing.\n\nTang Ming Huang said: If one does not employ clever ministers but instead takes pure-virtued officials, who can rest and flourish, manage affairs and resolve difficulties naturally, then clever deceit will grow thin and simplicity will flourish. When the people are harmonious, the years will be bountiful—this is why it is the state’s blessing.\n\nLiu Zhong Ping said: Not governing the state with cleverness is to *open the heavens* (开天); governing the state with cleverness is to *open the people* (开人). To open the heavens is to follow, and following means to act in what requires no effort—this is why their governance is not strict yet effective. To open the people is to pierce, and piercing means to lose oneself in excessive scrutiny—this is why their people are not simple but deficient.\n\nThus it is said: Governing the state with cleverness is the state’s ruin; not governing the state with cleverness is the state’s blessing.\n\nThe *New Sayings* say: Yao and Shun’s cleverness lay in not restricting things; Yu’s cleverness lay in acting in what required no effort. Not restricting things means not scrutinizing them to claim enlightenment; acting in what requires no effort means not piercing them to claim utility—this is truly to excel in the use of cleverness.\n\nIf we speak of the Laozi’s *not governing the state with cleverness*, it lies in preserving it, and then the people will benefit a hundredfold.\n\nUnderstanding these two principles is also the *standard model* (楷式).\n\nHe Shang Gong said: The two principles refer to cleverness and the lack of cleverness.\n\nThose who always know cleverness are the ruin; those who lack cleverness are the blessing.\n\nThis is the standard model for governing oneself and the state.\n\nTang Ming Huang said: To employ clever deceit harms the people; to employ pure virtue blesses the state. When a ruler understands these two principles, he entrusts pure-virtued officials—this is the standard model for being a ruler.\n\nLu Ji Fu said: Understanding these two principles is not just for governing the state, but also serves as a standard model for oneself, and it is never violated.\n\nAlways knowing the standard model is called *Mysterious Virtue* (玄德).\n\nHe Shang Gong said: *Mysterious* (玄) is the *heavenly* (天). To always know the standard model for governing oneself and the state is to align with the virtue of heaven.\n\nTang Ming Huang said: *Mysterious* (玄) means *deep* (深) and *wondrous* (妙). When a ruler always knows whom to entrust, this is called the deep, far-reaching, wondrous, and supreme virtue.\n\nMysterious Virtue is deep and far-reaching, opposing all things—\n\n*Commentary*: *Mysterious* (玄) is the color of heaven. To always know the standard model yet not use cleverness is to align with heaven’s virtue, deep beyond measure, far beyond reach, standing alone above all things, so that no thing can couple with it. Thus it is said: *It opposes all things.*»\n\nLiu Renhui said: *Mysterious Virtue* is unfathomable, hence it is called *deep*. It is exhaustive in all directions, hence it is called *far-reaching*. Abandoning cleverness and entrusting to simplicity, hence it is said: *It opposes all things*.\n\n*Mysterious Virtue* ascends and enters the realm of the *Small* (小), distinguishing itself from all things, hence it opposes all things. Only then does it reach the *Great Harmony* (大顺).\n\n*Commentary*: *Harmony* (顺) is the *principle of heaven* (天之理). To reach the *Great Harmony* is to discard cleverness and return to simplicity, following only the principle of heaven.\n\nZhuangzi said: *\"To align with Heaven and Earth, its alignment is seamless—\nas if simple, as if confused—\nthis is called *Mysterious Virtue*,\nin harmony with the *Great Harmony*.\"*\n\nOnly through such simplicity and confusion does one remove cleverness. Gu Huan said: *\"Though it may seem contrary to worldly ways, it is in harmony with the Dao.\"*\n\nThis chapter speaks of the *Dao* being employed secretly, guiding the people without their awareness. Without cleverness or deceit, it returns to the purity of simplicity. If one knows this as the standard model, it is the profound, far-reaching, wondrous, and supreme virtue—discarding cleverness and following the principle of heaven.\n\n*The Daoist Classic of Authentic Virtue and Goodness, Volume 10, Chapter 10* / *The Daoist Classic of Authentic Virtue and Goodness, Volume 11, Chapter 11*\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 66: The Jianghai (River and Sea) as Sovereign of All the Valleys**\n*Collected by Master Li Lin of Song’s Rao County*\n\nThe Jianghai (River and Sea) is able to be the sovereign of all the valleys\nbecause it excels in yielding.\n\nGu Huan said: *\"The Jianghai dwells in lowliness,\nthus all the valleys reverence it as their sovereign.\nA ruler abides in humility,\nand thus all things return to him.\nHence, he is able to be the sovereign of all the valleys.\"*\n\nThe Tang Emperor Minghuang said: *\"The Jianghai’s ability to command all the rivers\nto pay homage and make it their sovereign\narises from its excellence in occupying the lower reaches.\nThus, the *Yijing* says: ‘The Way of Earth transforms fullness into yielding flow.’\nThis is a metaphorical illustration.\nWhen the Way of Earth employs yielding,\nall the rivers converge and flow toward it.\nWhen the Sage employs yielding,\nthe common people come as his children\nand do not grow weary of him.\nIt is through lowliness and yielding\nthat one is able to be the sovereign of all the valleys.\nThe sovereign is the one to whom all things return.\nIf one yields, the people will return to him\nlike water flowing downward.\nThus, the Sage who seeks to elevate others\ndoes so through his words of yielding.\nWhoever seeks to precede others\nplaces himself behind in deed.\nHence, though he dwells above,\nthe people do not feel burdened;\nthough he stands before,\nthe people do not feel harmed.\nMaster Shàngshǔ Gōng said: ‘To be above others,\nfollow the Jianghai’s example of humility.\nTo precede others,\nact first for others, then for oneself.’\nThe Sage, though above the people as their ruler,\ndoes not oppress them with his exalted position,\nso they revere him without feeling the weight.\nThe Sage, though before the people,\ndoes not obscure those behind with his brilliance,\nso the people love him as they would a parent,\nand have no thought of harming him.\nThus, all under heaven willingly promote him\nand never tire of doing so.\"*\n\nLǚ Jìfǔ said: *\"The Sage’s possession of the world—\nin terms of his station, he is indeed the one above others.\nYet, when he is called ‘孤’ (*gū*, solitary),\n‘寡’ (*guǎ*, few), or ‘不谷’ (*bùgǔ*, unblessed),\nand bears the shame and ill fortune of the state,\nit is because of his words of yielding.\nIn terms of his order—\nhe is indeed the one who precedes others,\nyet he is pressed to act only after being compelled,\nmoved to respond only after being touched,\nand rises only when there is no alternative—\nthis is because he places himself behind in deed.\nIf he dwells above but the people do not feel burdened,\nthen the burden of reverence becomes light.\nIf he places himself behind in deed,\nthen though he stands before, the people do not feel harmed,\nand thus they follow him as a benefit.\nNo burden, no harm—\nthis is why all under heaven willingly promote him\nand never tire of doing so.\nBecause he does not contend,\nall under heaven cannot contend with him.\"*\n\nLuo Shi said: *\"The heart and form being empty,\nwho could contend with one who possesses nothing?\"*\n\nLǚ Jìfǔ said: *\"Because he yields in words\nand places himself behind in deed,\nhe does not contend.\nAll under heaven willingly promote him\nand never tire of doing so,\nso none can contend with him.\nThose who do not embody *Mysterious Virtue*—\ncould they ever be like this?\nThus it is said: ‘Because he does not contend,\nall under heaven cannot contend with him.’\nThis chapter takes yielding as its core:\nThe Jianghai excels in yielding,\nso it is the sovereign of all the valleys.\nThe Sage yields in words and places himself behind in deed,\nso all under heaven willingly promote him\nand never tire of doing so.\nWho could contend with one who yields?\"*\n\n---\n\n**All Under Heaven Say: My Dao**\n*All Under Heaven Say: My Dao Seems Like the Unresembling*\n\nAll under heaven say: *\"My Dao seems like the unresembling.\"*\n\nDu Bì said: *\"Unresembling means ‘not conforming to things.’\nSince it does not conform to things,\nit is called unresembling.\nOnly because it is vast,\nit seems like the unresembling.\"*\n\nSū Zǐyóu said: *\"The Dao is spacious and formless,\ndecayed and nameless.\nIt pervades all things,\nyet does not resemble any one thing—\nthis is why it is vast.\nIf it resembles things,\nthen it is merely one thing,\nand how could it be vast?\nIf it resembles, then it has long been small.\"*\n\nThe *Yizhù* (Commentary) says: *\"Resembling things is small;\nbeing resembled by things is vast.\nThe Dao encompasses all things—\nhow vast it is!\nThus, if it seems like the unresembling or resembling,\nthen the Dao has something outside of it—\nhow could it still be vast?\"*\n\nWáng Bì said: *\"‘It has long been small’—\nthis is also to say ‘its smallness has long endured.’\nIf it resembles, it loses its basis for being vast.\nThus it is said: ‘If it resembles,\nthen it has long been small.’\"*\n\nLǚ Jìfǔ said: *\"All under heaven merely see my Dao’s vastness\nand say it seems like the unresembling,\nyet they do not know why it is vast—\nindeed, it seems like the unresembling.\nHow so? The vast Dao is boundless,\nits influence cannot be confined to left or right,\nit is everywhere without exception.\nIf it is everywhere without exception,\nthere is nothing to doubt—\nyet they call it unresembling without knowing\nthat its vastness lies in its unresembling.\nIf it resembles anything,\nthen there would be something outside the Dao,\nand if the Dao has something outside of it,\nthen it is not everywhere—\ncould it still be vast?\nWáng Yuànzé said: ‘Resembling means\nthat something resembles the Dao,\nand the Sage is the progenitor of all things.\nThus, those who embody the Dao,\nthings should resemble him—\nhow could he resemble things?\nIf there is resemblance,\nthen he is an image of that thing.\nIf he is an image of that thing,\nthen that thing must be vast,\nand he would be small.\nI have the Three Treasures,\nto cherish and uphold them.’\"*\n\nThe Tang Emperor Minghuang said: *\"Though my Dao is vast,\nit does not resemble anything,\nyet there are these three practices—\nmost precious indeed!\nIf one can always cherish, lean upon, and uphold them,\nthey can govern oneself and govern the state.\"*\n\nWáng Yuànzé said: *\"All these Three Treasures—\nthough worldly sentiment calls them small,\nthey are the basis by which the highest person is vast.\"*\n\nThe first is *cì* (compassion).\nWáng Yuànzé said: *\"Compassion is rooted in love;\nlove is the virtue of benevolence toward things,\nyet it is uniquely called compassion—\nfor when it transforms, it spreads vast virtue\nto cover all below, reaching its peak at the end.\nThe *Laozi* speaks of its origin,\nso it does not say ‘transform,’\nbut says ‘compassion.’\nCompassion is the fundamental Way of the fatherly Dao,\nand it does not rely on artificial means.\"*\n\nTáng Zhì said: *\"Compassion is love.\nThe *Liji* says: ‘For the man who is a father,\nhis virtue stops at compassion—\nthis is beneficial.’\"*\n\n**Compassion** is the foundation of humanity.\nThe Dao of father and child is innate to nature.\nA person’s compassion and filial piety arise from their inherent nature,\nrequiring no external reliance.\n\nThe **virtuous** is the essence of humanity,\ntaking universal love as their heart—\nthis is far removed from innate nature.\nThe *Laozi* elucidates the essentials of virtue and power,\nthus treasuring compassion as the jewel.\n\nThe **Prophet**’s Five Constants place benevolence first.\nThe **Buddha’s** Ten Precepts forbid killing above all.\nThough the Three Sages differ,\nthey all ground themselves in compassion—\nthus they are one.\n\n**The second is frugality.**\nGu Wén said: *\"Treasure vital essence, cherish qi—\ndo not indulge in extravagance.\"*\n\nLǚ Jìfǔ said: *\"In conduct, he moves with measured restraint,\ntaking moderation as his standard—\nis this not frugality?\"*\nFrugality is the shared virtue of power.\nGreat Yú cultivated himself,\nconsidering extreme frugality as expenditure.\nKing Wén governed by promoting restraint as transformation.\nGreat indeed is the virtue of frugality!\nThe *Shū* says: *\"With reverence and frugality, virtue is achieved.\"*\n\n**The third is not daring to lead the world.**\nGu Wén said: *\"Walk in humility, dwell in the rear—\ndo not take precedence over others.\"*\n\nLǚ Jìfǔ said: *\"Never taking the lead,\nyet always following others,\nwhile all take precedence,\nhe alone takes the rear—\nis this not not daring to lead the world?\"*\n\nWáng Yuànzé said: *\"In the *Yì*, this is ‘humility.’\nHeaven, Earth, humanity, and spirits—\nall hold humility as noble,\nthus the Sage treasures it.\nThe Sage of Confucius grounds himself in the Dao of benevolence,\ntakes frugality and yielding as virtue,\nand treasures these three as well.\"*\n\n**Compassion thus enables courage.**\nWáng Bì said: *\"Compassion, when deployed, conquers;\nwhen held firm, it endures—\nthus it enables courage.\"*\n\nLǚ Jìfǔ said: *\"Compassion is soft and weak,\nyet it overcomes

enables breadth.**\nGu Wén said: *\"Cultivate the body, cherish qi—\nthen life and nature prolong themselves.\nGovern the state, cherish the people—\nthen virtue and transformation spread naturally.\nFrugality in self-cultivation preserves spirit;\nrestraint in governance ensures surplus resources.\nThe *Shū* says: ‘Be cautious with your frugal virtue,\nand hold fast to enduring

for precedence—\nthey are doomed.\n\n*Commentary*: *\"The world knows that courage suffices to conquer others,\nyet they do not know that compassion alone enables courage.\nThey know that breadth suffices to boast before the masses,\nyet they do not know that frugality alone enables breadth.\nThey know that completion as an instrument is worthy of reverence,\nyet they do not know that taking the rear is essential—\nthus they are merely rigid and strong,\nand their path leads to death.\"*\n\nGu Wén said: *\"Discarding compassion and mercy,\nthey instead seek daring—\nthis is reckless

angry,\nthe skilled victor does not contend,\nthe skilled leader places himself below others—\nthis is fitting indeed.\"*\n\nWar is a perilous affair.\nThe skilled warrior laments the people and punishes crime—\nhow could there be private anger to employ peril and harm the people?\n\nIf the Shang King Wu overthrew Jie, as did King Tang in deposing Jie—this is how one conquers an enemy without contention.\n\n*The skilled victor does not contend.*\n*Commentary*: Contention is contrary to virtue.\n\nTo fight for land, the dead fill the fields;\nto fight for cities, the dead fill the streets—\nvictory and defeat are yet undetermined.\n\nIt is through non-force that force is perfected,\nthrough non-anger that anger is fulfilled,\nthrough non-contention that contention is transcended—\nthese three arise from virtue, hence they are called *skilled*.\n\nHé Shànggōng said: *\"The skilled warrior who conquers by the Dao\nattracts the near with benevolence,\ndraws the distant with virtue,\nand does not contend with the enemy—\nyet the enemy surrenders of its own accord.\"*\n\nLiú Rénhuì said: *\"Virtue moves things to submission—\nthus it is called conquering the enemy.\nWeapons do not clash—\nthus it is called not contending.\"*\n\nContention is contrary to virtue.\nNot to contend yet to conquer—\nthis is what is called *skilled*.\n\nWarfare is most noble when strategy is struck down;\nrepeatedly exchanging blows is not the highest use of arms.\nA hundred battles, a hundred victories—\nthis is not the skillful use of warfare.\nThe skillful user of arms conquers without battle—\nthis is the supreme skill.\n\nThe skillful leader places himself below others.\n\n*Commentary*: Though wisdom encompasses heaven and earth, it does not presume—\nthus the wise are employed for counsel.\nThough ability exhausts the seas within, it does not act alone—\nthus the capable are employed for service.\nThough eloquence carves through all things, it does not boast—\nthus the eloquent are employed as messengers.\n\nHé Shànggōng said: *\"The skillful leader who relies on assistants\nmust practice humility and deference.\"*\n\nZhuǎn Wēi said: *\"The skillful leader employs virtue, not force.\nThus, using ministers of support and counsel,\nthey are compared to limbs and sinews of the body.\nUsing generals,\nthey kneel to receive their commands,\nand march

reckless,\nstained by worldly dust,\nleads to the three woeful paths.\"*\n\nTo treat the enemy lightly risks losing one’s treasure.\n\nChéng Xuányīng said: *\"‘Risks’ means to exhaust.\nTo treat the enemy lightly is to love courage yet lack benevolence,\nto expand greed yet lose frugality,\nto love advancing yet forget retreat—\nall three treasures are exhausted.\"*\n\nLǚ Jìfǔ said: *\"If one cannot emerge from non-action,\nknowing the aggressor yet not the defender,\nknowing advance yet not retreat—\nthis is called treating the enemy lightly.\nTo treat the enemy lightly is to lose one’s benevolence\nand forfeit the hearts of the seven peoples and all things.\"*\n\nThus, when armies clash,\nthe one who first displays mercy will win.\n\n「Wang Yuanzé said: *\"The heart of compassion—this is virtue.\nVirtue is why one can be courageous, and thus prevail.*\nAnother reading has ‘相若’ (mutually comparable), which also makes sense.\n‘若’ here refers to armies clashing in

arriving.’*\nUsing intelligence to know it,\none’s understanding will be shallow—\nthus, none in the world can truly know it.\nUsing force to follow it,\none cannot attain—\nthus, none in the world can truly follow it.\nWords have a root, affairs have a lord.\nThe imperial commentary states:\n*Words cannot be exhausted,\nyet principle is their foundation.*\n*Affairs cannot be fully addressed,\nyet the Dao is their sovereign.*\nFollowing principle to seek understanding,\nand adhering to the Dao to act—\nthen the world has no difficulty.\nWords take *non-speech* as their root;\naffairs take *non-action* as their lord.\nObtaining the root makes understanding easy,\nrecognizing the lord makes action easy.\nThose in the world who cannot understand or cannot follow,\nsimply do not know their root or their lord.\nOnly those without knowledge,\nare why they do not know me.\n\nWang Bi said:\n*‘Being clothed in coarse sackcloth yet holding jade within’*—\nclothing in coarse sackcloth means blending with the common,\nholding jade within means treasuring one’s true essence.\nThe sage is difficult to know,\nbecause they blend with the common yet do not stand out,\nhold jade within yet do not display it—\nthus, they are difficult to know and yet noble.\nCoarse sackcloth is the garment of the vulgar,\njade is the precious treasure.\nClothing in coarse sackcloth means appearing crude externally,\nharmonizing one’s light with the dust,\nacting as if foolish or dim-witted,\nnot differing from the common.\nHolding jade within means concealing treasure inwardly,\nembracing the Dao and nurturing virtue,\nhiding one’s name and reputation,\nnot revealing oneself to others.\nThis differs from the vulgar crowd who flaunt jade on their sleeves.\nZhuangzi said:\n*The sage holds it within themselves,\nwhile the common people debate to show it to others.*\nThis chapter states that the Dao is easy to know and easy to follow,\nyet none in the world can know or follow it—\nbecause words have a root and affairs have a lord.\nOnly those who have the root and lord,\nare why the knowing ones are few.\nThe sage is difficult to know,\nbecause they treasure this Dao and wear coarse sackcloth.\n\n**Chapter Seventy-One: Knowing the Unknown**\nKnowing the unknown is supreme.\nNot knowing yet claiming to know is an affliction.\n\nLǚ Jìfǔ said:\n*The essence of the Dao is\nto know without knowing yet be able to know.*\nTo recognize one’s own ignorance,\nand yet know through that ignorance—\nthis is the highest attainment.\nThus it is said: *‘Knowing the unknown is supreme.’*\nThough one recognizes their ignorance,\nyet insists on knowing through knowledge—\ntheir mind is mediocre and unpeaceful.\nThus it is said: *‘Not knowing yet claiming to know is an affliction.’*\n\nWen Gong said:\n*‘Knowing yet acting as if one does not know,\nkeeps one distant from blame.’*\n*‘Not knowing yet insisting on knowing,\ninvites disaster.’*\nOnly by recognizing the affliction of affliction,\ndoes one avoid affliction.\nTang Minghuang said:\n*‘Only by recognizing the affliction of insisting on knowing,\ndoes one not fall prey to that insistence.’*\nThe sage is not afflicted,\nbecause they recognize affliction—\nthus they are not afflicted.\n\nLǚ Jìfǔ said:\n*‘Only by recognizing the affliction of knowing as an affliction,\nand yet overcoming that affliction,\ndoes one return to non-knowing—\nand then knowledge is no longer an affliction.’*\nThus, the sage is not afflicted—\nthis is why.\n\nNanbo Ziqí said:\n*‘I pity those who destroy themselves.\nI also pity those who pity others.\nI also pity those who pity those who pity others.’*\nLater, he said: *‘Far indeed.’*\nIf one like Ziqí’s tea,\ncan be called *‘recognizing the affliction of affliction’*?\n\nWang Yuanzé said:\n*‘If one is afflicted yet does not recognize it,\nthe afflicted will never awaken.’*\n\nThis chapter speaks of the **Dao/Way** having no inherent knowing—\nknowing that one does not know is superior,\nbut if one does not know yet acts,\nand knows through knowing,\nthen this becomes an affliction.\n\nThe sage’s non-affliction lies in\nknowing knowing as an affliction,\nand returning to non-knowing—\nthus they are not afflicted.\n\n**Chapter 72: The People Do Not Fear Threat**\n\nIf the people do not fear the **threat/menace**,\nthen great threat will come.\n\n**He Shang Gong** said:\n*\"Threat is harm.\nIf people do not fear small harm,\nthen great harm will come—\nspeaking of death.\nThose who fear it should cherish their vital essence and nurture their spirit,\nharmonizing with Heaven and following Earth.\"*\n\n**Cheng Xuan Ying** said:\n*\"Within, they understand the threat of penalties—\nthe scriptures, precepts, and laws.\nThe great threat refers to the punishments of the Three Hells (Skt. *naraka*), the Northern Cities of Retribution (*Douluo Yanzheng*), and the *Tianluo* realm.\nAll beings, not yet comprehending true **dharma/principle**,\nindulge in worldly **laws** and act lightly,\nso the true **dharma/principle** brings great punishment,\nwhich must surely come.\"*\n\n**Liu Zhong Ping** said:\n*\"The **Book of Poetry** says:\n‘Fear the awe of Heaven,\nand in time, you will be preserved.’\nIndeed, the multitude does not know to fear Heaven’s awe,\nso great threat comes.\nThat which has threat to be feared is called threat.\nWhen the multitude does not fear Heaven’s awe,\nthey do nothing they should not.\nThis is why Heaven descends its great calamity and retribution,\nand the disasters and punishments are applied.\nThus it is said:\n‘Great threat will come.’\"*\n\n*\"The **Book of Documents** says:\n‘None dare act without fear,\nbut those who do not fear will be made to fear.’\nDo not constrain their dwelling,\n**Commentary:** ‘Dwelling’ refers to the abode of nature.\nHuman nature is vast and unrestricted—\nit cannot be enclosed or bent.\nThe scholar does not speak of the **Dao/Way**,\nbecause their dwelling is constrained.\nExpand and fulfill it,\nand it will fill Heaven and Earth,\nembrace the Six Extremes (*liuji*—the four cardinal directions and heaven and earth),\nand nothing will be beyond its reach.\nMencius said:\n‘Dwell in the broadest place of the world.’\nThe Tang Emperor Ming Huang said:\n‘The abode of the spirit is the heart.’\nDo not constrain their dwelling—\nthis means removing emotions and desires,\nmaking them pure and void,\nso that the spirit may dwell within without constraint.\nDo not satiate their birth—\n**Commentary:** ‘Birth’ refers to the gathering of **qi**.\nHuman birth is connected to the transformations of all things,\nbut those who satiate their birth\nare bound by the actions of day and night,\nand their **qi** is diminished.\nThose who preserve the Great Harmony (*Dahua*—the perfect balance of Heaven and Earth)\nand do not perish by the **middle path** (*Zhongdao*—the path of moderation),\ndo not satiate their birth.\"*\n\n**He Shang Gong** said:\n*\"Why people are born is because they have spirit.\nThe spirit depends on emptiness and purity,\nloves tranquility and stillness,\nbut if eating and drinking are unregulated,\nand one neglects the **Dao/Way** while indulging in sensuality,\nthen perverse and disruptive **qi** fills the body,\nand this is how life is cut short and the spirit scattered.\"*\n\n**Liu Zhong Ping** said:\n*\"‘Do not constrain their dwelling’—\nthis is the foundation of **virtue/power**.\n‘Do not satiate their birth’—\nthis is the root of **virtue/power**.\nThe foundation of **virtue/power** is to fulfill nature,\nand the root of **virtue/power** is to reach the vital essence of life.\nThus, the sage does not use human means to extinguish Heaven’s **virtue/power**,\nnor does they use worldly ways to diminish life’s essence.\n**Wang Yuanze** said:\n‘Human nature is originally broad and flowing,\nbut as worldly teachings decline,\nthey cannot restore it to its pristine state,\nso they narrow their dwelling and make it constrained,\nand they block their birth and make it stifled.\nOnly by constraining their dwelling\ndo the people become impure and false.\nOnly by satiating their birth\ndo the people become thin and shallow.\nBut the sage is not so—\nthey let the people roam freely in the broadest place of the world,\nand each fulfills their vast and unrestrained nature,\nso who among them would dare to provoke Heaven’s threat?’\"*\n\n**Zhuangzi** said:\n*\"The garden of the **Wei** family,\nthe park of the Yellow Emperor,\nthe domain of Yao and Shun,\nthe palace of Tang and Wu—\nthis is the world of the sage.\nThe world declines and grows narrow in its dwellings.\nBut the sage has no superiority or inferiority—\ntheir dwelling grows narrow only because the times they encounter are so.\"*\n\n*\"Only by not satiating\nis one not satiated.\"*\n\n**He Shang Gong** said:\n*\"Only those who do not satiate their spirit\nwash away the filth of the heart,\nbeing serene and content without desire,\ncan have the spirit dwell within them without satiation.\"*\n\n**Gu Xuan** said:\n*\"People do not satiate their birth,\nand their birth does not satiate them.\nPeople do not abandon the **Dao/Way**,\nand the **Dao/Way** does not abandon them.\nThus it is said:\n‘Birth and people mutually preserve,\npeople and the **Dao/Way** mutually benefit.’\nThe **Western Ascension Scripture** says:\n‘The spirit always loves people,\nbut people do not love the spirit.\nIf people do not satiate their spirit,\nthen the spirit will dwell within them and not depart.\nThus, the sage knows themselves but does not display themselves,\nloves themselves but does not exalt themselves.’\"*\n\n**He Shang Gong** said:\n*\"They know their own gains and losses,\nyet do not reveal themselves outwardly.\n**Virtue/power** and beauty exist externally but are stored internally.\nThey love their own body to preserve their vital **qi**,\nyet do not elevate themselves in status or honor.\nThey cherish their name in the world.\"*\n\n**Lü Jìfǔ** said:\n*\"The sage knows themselves in constancy yet does not display themselves outwardly.\nTheir body knows constancy while their outward actions transcend it—\nthis is how they do not constrain their dwelling.\nThey love themselves through moderation yet do not exalt themselves through excess—\ntheir birth is preserved while their life is not squandered—\nthis is how they do not satiate their birth.\"*\n\n**Liu Jin Xi** said:\n*\"Preserving and nurturing true nature,\nnot lightly indulging in desires—\nthis is self-love.\nModesty, humility, stillness, and retreat,\nplacing others before themselves—\nthis is not exalting themselves.\nIf they know themselves through clarity yet do not display themselves through boasting,\nthen their nature is broad, and nothing can obscure it—\nthis is ‘not constraining their dwelling.’\nIf they love themselves through virtue yet do not exalt themselves through belittling others,\nthen their birth is complete, and nothing can harm it—\nthis is ‘not satiating their birth.’\nIf this is so,\nhow could they ever provoke Heaven’s threat?\"*\n\nThus, one discards that and takes this.\n**Gu Xuan** said:\n*\"Discarding that and taking this—\nif one sees the exalted as noble, then external punishments will fade.\nIf one knows and loves, then inner sufficiency of life and **Dao/Way** will be fulfilled.\"*\n\nThis chapter speaks of\nthe upper losing its great **Dao/Way**’s transformation,\nand the people losing their true nature of life.\nThus, though there are threats to be feared,\nthey do not fear them.\nOnly by not constraining their dwelling to fulfill nature,\nand not satiating their birth to reach life’s essence,\ncould they ever provoke Heaven’s threat?\nThus, one discards that which exalts and displays,\nand takes this which knows and loves—\nalso making the people broaden their dwelling and not constrain it,\npreserving their birth and not satiating it.\n\nThe sage’s discernment in discarding and taking\nis clearly visible.\n\n**Chapter 73: On Bold Courage**\n\n*\"Bold in daring leads to death.\nMetuan said: ‘Fearlessness is courage; resoluteness is daring. To see threats and fear them not, yet act without hesitation—this is the art of forcing *qi* to destroy the body.\n\nChen Xuanying said: ‘Courage is fierce advancement. Daring is resolute resolve. Death is annihilation. If one advances yet lacks resolve, clinging to worldly affairs, then annihilation follows.\n\nLuó Shì said: When the mind is steadfast in action, resolute in seeking, truly abandoning evil and inviting virtue, one meets one’s fate—thus it is called death.\n\nBold without daring brings life.\nLuó Shì said: If one acts with gentleness and goodness alone, one gains benefit—this is life, the way of long endurance. If the heart is empty and detached, not clinging to defilements, then there is long life.\n\nMetuan said: To stand alone, fearless, yet not daring to act—guarding softness and yielding fully—this is the way to preserve life.\n\nShū Wáng said: Zhuangzi said: ‘The Sage treats the necessary as unnecessary, thus wields no arms. The common man treats the unnecessary as necessary, thus wields many arms. Bold in daring treats the unnecessary as necessary, thus wields many arms and meets death. Bold without daring treats the necessary as unnecessary, thus wields no arms and lives.\n\nLǚ Jìfǔ said: Those who wield their strength and fixate on externals are bold in daring—these are the doomed. Thus it is said: *Bold in daring leads to death.*\n\nThose who govern with gentleness and fixate on nothing are bold without daring—these are the living. Thus it is said: *Bold without daring brings life.*\n\nThese two paths—one brings benefit, one harm.\nHé Shànggōng said: The two refer to daring and not daring. Preserving life is benefit; destroying life is harm.\n\nWang Bì said: Both are forms of courage, yet their applications differ—thus benefit and harm arise. Hence it is said: *One brings benefit, one harm.*\n\nLǚ Jìfǔ said: Bold in daring may seem beneficial, yet harm lies within. Bold without daring may seem harmful, yet benefit lies within. What Heaven abhors, who knows its reason?\n\nOfficial Commentary: Those who deviate from humanity align with Heaven. What benefits humanity, Heaven abhors—who can know its source? Thus even the Sage finds it difficult.\n\nOfficial Commentary: Those who follow Heaven endure; those who defy it perish—even the Sage dares not alter this.\n\nThe Way of Heaven does not contend yet triumphs well.\nOfficial Commentary: All things emerge, and Heaven emerges with them without resistance. All things return, and Heaven receives them without obstruction—this is called not contending. Ebb and flow, fullness and emptiness, accompany all things, yet all their abundance comes from received fate—this is called not contending yet triumphing well.\n\nTáng Mínghuáng said: Below, it speaks of Heaven’s humility and emptiness, admonishing human boldness. Heaven does not contend with things; the four seasons wax and wane without resistance—thus it triumphs well.\n\nIt does not speak yet responds well.\nWáng Yuānzé said: How does Heaven speak? The seasons move, myriad things flourish, rewarding virtue and punishing licentiousness—all changes respond without a word.\n\nLiú Rénhuì said: Silent and still, thus it is called ‘not speaking.’ Yet when moved, it responds—thus it is called ‘responds well.’\n\nIt is not summoned yet comes.\nOfficial Commentary: Those who receive fate can summon it, yet Heaven governs all things’ fates—who can summon them? It simply follows the natural course of *qi*.\n\nIt moves with effortless ease, yet plans with consummate skill.\nCài Zǐhuǎng said: Though vast and unconstrained, it plans with precision—good and evil differ not by a hair.\n\nWáng Yuānzé said: Ever easy, thus unconstrained; knowing peril, thus plans well.\n\nHeaven’s net is vast, sparse yet nothing escapes.\nOfficial Commentary: Dense yet with gaps—this is human artifice. Heaven, though sparse, has no gaps. Accumulated virtue and vice bring retribution in kind—thus nothing is lost. Yet only through contention does one triumph, only through speech does one respond—this is humanity. Heaven does not contend yet triumphs well, does not speak yet responds well. Summoned, it arrives; yet to know Heaven is difficult for humanity. Heaven arrives unsummoned, unconstrained yet plans well.\n\nOnly the Sage can embody this, thus does not seek benefit nor shun harm—always benefiting, never harming—thus aligning with Heaven’s virtue, differing from those bold in daring.\n\nCáo Dàochōng said: Nothing escapes Heaven’s net—vast yet encompassing all. Though sparse, nothing slips through. Encompassing all six directions, no thing escapes within—this is Heaven’s net. *Héihéi*—vast indeed. Though seemingly sparse, rewards and punishments differ not by a hair.\n\nThis chapter speaks of bold daring and not daring. Bold daring is what Heaven abhors—even the Sage finds it difficult. Below, it speaks of Heaven’s humility and emptiness, urging it as a model. The people do not commonly fear death—\n\n**Chapter 74: The People Do Not Commonly Fear Death**\n\n*The people do not commonly fear death—how then can you frighten them with death?*\n\nMetuan said: *Nàihé*—how, as in ‘how can this be?’ When Dao and virtue decay, punishments grow harsh and cruel, then life is not cherished, death not feared. People do not fear death because governance is oppressive. If they do not revere great virtue in life, yet you impose severe punishments to instill fear, the people will defy laws and never reform.\n\nLuxury and licentiousness drain the vital essence and *qi*, causing the spirits to scatter—driven to perilous acts that shock the soul. When the ruler loses the Way, the people lack constancy, defying laws—what is there to fear in death? Yet the ruler still threatens death, using saws and axes, ropes and measuring lines, yet chaos never ceases—this is the case of Qin and after.\n\nIf the people commonly feared death, and acted strangely, I would seize and kill them—who would dare?\"*\n\nThe Imperial Commentary states: *\"The world delights in life yet often violates the law. Only then do those with strange words face punishment, and those with deviant conduct face prohibition. As Coeficial Master said, the crime of defying governance is indeed grave.\"*\n\nRiver Master declared: *\"If one governs through the Dao/Way and the people still do not comply, instead engaging in strange artifices, then the king’s law should be applied—seizing and executing them. Who would dare transgress?\"*\n\nLaozi lamented the times: *\"The ruler does not first cultivate the people with virtue and the Dao/Way, but instead begins with punishments and penalties.\"*\n\nWang Bi remarked: *\"Deviance disrupts the true—this is called ‘strange.’ The constant agents of execution carry out the killings.\"*\n\nEmperor Xuanzong of Tang said: *\"Such deceitful and strange individuals—none escape the Heavenly Net. It is the constant agents of execution who carry out the killings.\"*\n\nDu Guangting explained: *\"司 (sī) means ‘master.’ Heaven’s nurturing of humanity is profound, its love for them is supreme. The Southern Palace’s Golden Register rewards virtue and oversees life, while the Northern Palace’s Black Ledger records offenses and governs death. Heaven and Earth, along with the myriad spirits, oversee and judge good and evil, using them to admonish and encourage, so that evil may be abandoned and virtue cultivated. Thus, those with merit extend their years, while the guilty have their fate diminished—no fraction is lost, as in the meticulous reckoning of the Yang Palace. Heaven has the Four Official Stars of Destiny, located between Xu and Wei, beside the Human Star, overseeing humanity. These Four Official Stars are what the *Three Elements Scripture* calls ‘Heaven’s agents of execution.’*\n\n*\"To substitute as the agent of execution is to usurp the Great Carpenter’s axe. River Master said: ‘If a ruler seeks to execute in place of Heaven, it is like a clumsy man substituting for the Great Carpenter in hewing wood—laboring without success.’ To substitute for the Great Carpenter in hewing wood is to rarely avoid injuring one’s own hands. River Master said: ‘When a ruler enforces punishments, it is like a clumsy man substituting for the Great Carpenter in hewing wood—squares and circles will never align, and he will inevitably harm himself. To usurp Heaven’s execution is to disrupt its order. Without proper order, one will instead invite calamity.’*\n\nLu Jifu asked: *\"How should the Sage govern the world through the Dao/Way?\"*\n*\"Simply let the constant agents of execution carry out the killings—do not usurp their role.\"*\n\nWhat are the ‘constant agents of execution’? The Heavenly Net is vast yet never fails to ensnare. Heaven’s retribution for crimes employs the Five Punishments and Five Executions—this is the role of the agents of execution. If executions arise from personal bias rather than Heaven’s retribution, then it is usurping the role of the agents of execution. To usurp the agents of execution is to usurp the Great Carpenter’s axe—rarely does one avoid injuring their own hands. Thus, the harm of usurping the agents of execution is clear.\n\nThis chapter states that when the people lack constancy and do not fear death, one must first cultivate them through the Dao/Way, not intimidate them with punishments. If the people fear death and those who act strangely are executed, who would dare transgress? Yet one must not execute oneself—there are Heaven’s agents of execution. If one usurps their role, it is like substituting for the Great Carpenter, and none escape harming themselves.\n\n*Conclusion of Volume Eleven of the *Collected Virtues of the Dao/Way and Its Power Scripture***\n*Beginning of Volume Twelve of the *Collected Virtues of the Dao/Way and Its Power Scripture***\n\n「Thus, the people’s hunger arises from the excessive taxes and levies imposed by their rulers—hence their hunger. *The Imperial Commentary* states: Heavy taxation leads to widespread barrenness of fields and crops, and the people lack sufficient food.\n\n Lü Jiufu remarks: If one man’s labor can feed several households, why should there ever be hunger? Yet when hunger does arise, is it not precisely because of the excessive taxes and levies demanded by their rulers?\n\n Wang Yuanzhe asserts: If one establishes official salaries and implements the rites of taxation properly, it would be to enrich the people. But when expenditures grow lavish while the foundations of governance weaken, and taxes multiply while essentials decline, the result is merely that the people starve.\n\n The Duke of Zhou imposed heavy taxes, leading to the rise of Chu. *The Book of Songs* composed the *Huge Rat* ode to censure the Duke of Wei for his oppressive taxation.\n\n The difficulty of governing the people stems from the rulers’ excessive interventions—hence their difficulty in being governed. *The Imperial Commentary* states: When governance is intricate, deceit and falsehood flourish, and the people lose their simplicity.\n\n Liu Jinxi notes: Excessive intervention makes governance cumbersome; non-intervention simplifies affairs. Simplicity is easy to follow, while intricacy is hard to govern.\n\n The six passions are hard to control because of the rulers’ excessive interventions. Lü Jiufu says: Weaving yields clothing, tilling yields food—this is called harmonizing virtue. Why should governing be difficult? Yet when governance becomes difficult, is it not because of the rulers’ excessive interventions?\n\n Wang Yuanzhe states: If one entrusts discerning officials to manage affairs, it would be to govern the people. But when men are burdened by customs and refined by worldly influence, craftiness and deceit proliferate, making governance even harder. Observing the ancient past and later ages confirms this truth.\n\n Shun governed through non-intervention, enabling his rule as Emperor. Wu governed with relaxed oversight, securing his reign as King. The rise and flourishing of emperors and kings all originate from this principle.\n\n *The Scripture* says: To govern through non-action is to ensure nothing remains ungoverned.\n\n The people’s disregard for death stems from their excessive pursuit of life—hence their lightness toward death. *Zuan Wei* explains: Heavy taxation and cumbersome governance strip the people of their livelihoods, driving them to compete for treasures and risk laws and prohibitions. They court death recklessly because their pursuit of means to sustain life is too fervent, leading to those who fear neither drowning nor burning, nor wielding blades.\n\n Lü Jiufu says: If their food is sweet, their clothing fine, their dwellings secure, and their customs joyful, why should they ever regard death lightly? Yet when they do regard death lightly, is it not because their pursuit of life’s sustenance is too fervent?\n\n Wen Gong observes: The pursuit of profit is meant to nourish life, yet the people often lose their lives through profit. Overvaluing life while greedily seeking profit inevitably leads to courting danger, and thus they view death lightly.\n\n Only those who do not cling to life for its own sake are wiser than those who prize it. *The Imperial Commentary* cites *Zhuangzi*: \"Those who understand the nature of life do not strive for what life cannot provide.\" Not clinging to life means abandoning what life cannot provide. To forsake worldly affairs and relinquish life’s burdens is the way. When one’s form is unlabored and essence unexhausted, form preserved and essence restored, one aligns with Heaven—this is wiser than merely prizing life.\n\n Prizing life differs from regarding death lightly; relinquishing life’s burdens is wiser than merely prizing it. Extending the principles that benefit one’s own life to the people would result in light taxation and few punishments, ensuring households are well-provided and people are content, while distinct clothing and customs would prevent transgressions. This is the ultimate achievement of emperors and kings.\n\n This chapter speaks of heavy taxation and cumbersome governance, which strip the people of their livelihoods, leading them to regard death lightly. These three issues all harm the essentials while neglecting the foundations. Prizing life differs from regarding death lightly, while not clinging to life’s burdens is wiser than merely prizing it.\n\n---\n*Chapter Seventy-Six: On the Nature of Life and Death*\n\nThe nature of human life is soft and weak, while death brings rigidity and strength. *He Shang Gong* says: In life, humans contain harmonious *qi* and embrace spirit, hence their softness and weakness. In death, harmonious *qi* is exhausted and spirit departs, hence their rigidity and strength.\n\n All things, grasses, and trees are soft and pliable in life—*He Shang Gong* says: Because harmonious *qi* remains. In death, they wither and decay—*He Shang Gong* says: Because harmonious *qi* disperses.\n\n Yan Zun explains: Where *yang qi* resides, trees can be bent and grasses can be tied. Where *yang qi* departs, water can solidify and ice can break. Thus, rigidity and strength belong to death, while softness and weakness belong to life.\n\n *He Shang Gong* says: By observing these two phenomena, one knows that rigidity and strength signify death, while softness and weakness signify life.\n\n Emperor Ming of the Tang dynasty remarked: It is clear that those who preserve their softness and weakness remain alive and long-lived, while those who grow rigid and overbearing perish and lose their nature.\n\n Lü Jiufu says: *The Dao* is a thing without form yet not contentious. Thus, it is the most soft and weak in the world, yet none comprehend it. Hence, to illustrate it with things of form: The nature of human life is soft and weak, while death brings rigidity and strength. Grasses and trees are soft and pliable in life, but wither and decay in death. Even though these things have form, they die through rigidity and strength, and live through softness and weakness—how much more so the Dao, which has no form, yet does not lead to softness and weakness! It is impossible to attain.\n\n Therefore, when armies grow strong, they cannot prevail—*The Imperial Commentary* states: When opposing armies clash, the sorrowful will triumph.\n\n Wang Zhen notes: The remnants of Xia and Shang, with armies numbering in the hundreds of thousands, overthrew the four seas. Yet at the end of Qin Shi Huang’s reign, despite his unified empire, he lost all nine regions. Xiang Yu rose to power swiftly and perished just as quickly. Wang Mang usurped the throne and was destroyed soon after. Fu Jian was defeated in humiliation at the Huai River; Emperor Yang of the Sui dynasty collapsed in splendor at the Chu Palace. These numerous dynasties all fielded armies of tens of millions, or even hundreds of millions, yet none failed to rely on their strength, only to meet defeat—this is all evidence that when armies grow strong, they cannot prevail.\n\n Armies that rely on their strength inevitably become arrogant and haughty. Arrogance and haughtiness are the paths to ruin and annihilation. Qin Shi Huang was at his strongest, yet his dynasty did not last two generations before collapsing. The Xiang family’s sudden rise to power was swiftly followed by extinction. When wood grows rigid, it splits—*The Imperial Commentary* says: Even the sturdy *tong* or *zhi* trees, when bent, are known to crack.」\n\n「When strong, they are felled and split. Lush forests invite the axe—when wood is strong, it is felled and split. The mighty are brought low, while the yielding rise.\n\n*The Imperial Commentary* notes: The yielding overcomes the rigid, the weak overcomes the strong—this is the Dao/Way and skill of the Master Laozi, as Lao Dan [Zhuangzi] demonstrates with his emphasis on moist-weakness and humble yielding.\n\nGazing upward at Heaven, Heaven accumulates *qi* and thus stands above; Earth accumulates form and thus lies below. Taking examples from the natural world, the flexible branches yield while above, the sturdy trunk stands firm below. By this analogy, it is clear that the rigid and strong reside below, while the yielding and weak stand above.\n\nThis passage broadly discusses how all beings—whether human or otherwise—thrive through yielding and weakness, perish through rigidity and strength. Those who seek to preserve the Way of life must surely take heed of this.\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Seven of *The Dao of Heaven***:\nThe Dao/Way of Heaven is like drawing a bow. The lofty are pressed down, the lowly are raised up, the overabundant are diminished, the insufficient are supplemented. *The Imperial Commentary* notes: The Dao/Way of Heaven holds the mean as supreme, thus pressing down the lofty so they do not become excessive, raising up the lowly so they do not fall into deficiency. It advances those who are about to come, withdraws those who have succeeded. The Four Seasons cycle in turn, each attaining its proper *chǔ* [seasonal order/position].」\n\n**严遵** said: The artisan who crafts a bow neither overbends nor underbends it, neither slackens nor over-tightens it. He shapes it by the compass and plumb-line, ensuring strict alignment. If the string is too taut and high, he relaxes and lowers it; if the string is too slack and low, he tightens and raises it. Where there is excess, he carves away to diminish it; where there is deficiency, he fills and supplements it. The string and the bow’s body balance each other—upper and lower in harmony—with evenness as the principle and attunement as the norm. Thus, the bow may be struck, and the arrow may fly true.\n\nThe principle of pressing down the high and raising the low, diminishing the excessive and supplementing the deficient—this is the Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth.\n\n**Zhang Junxiang** said: The art of using a bow lies in this: the high must be feared for excess, so it is pressed down lest it rise too far. The low must be feared for insufficiency, so it is raised lest it fall too low. Neither too high nor too low—this is the mean, the measure of perfection. In governance, too, one must seek this equilibrium: excessive height invites rejection, while harming the low invites censure. Pressing down the high and raising the low—this aligns with the natural order.\n\n**Emperor Xuanzong of Tang** said: Only when the bow is thus attuned can one strike true. This is like the Dao/Way of Heaven, which diminishes excess and supplements deficiency, teaching rulers to emulate Heaven’s *de* [virtue/power] and govern humanity accordingly—hence the principle of pressing down the high and raising the low.\n\nThe Dao/Way of Heaven diminishes excess and supplements deficiency.\n*The Imperial Commentary* notes: *\"Fullness invites loss; humility invites benefit—this is the Dao/Way of time.\"* But the Dao/Way of humanity is reversed: the deficient are sacrificed to serve the excessive.\n*The Imperial Commentary* notes: Human nature elevates the low to oppress the high, favors the few while fearing the eminent.\n\n**Wang Yuanzai** said: Human governance follows inclination, thus it is unequal.\n\n**He Shangong** said: The Dao/Way of humanity is contrary to that of Heaven. Common folk diminish the poor to enrich the rich, plunder the weak to empower the strong. Who, then, can use their excess to nourish the world, but the sage alone?\n*The Imperial Commentary* notes: Only the sage does not oppress the few while exhausting the many, nor does he fear the eminent while depriving the generous. Only the sage can do this.\n\n**He Shangong** said: Who can occupy a position of excess, yet voluntarily reduce their rank and wealth to nourish those in want? Only the sage-ruler can act thus.\n\n**Wang Yuanzai** said: The sage harmonizes with the Dao/Way of Heaven. Therefore, the sage acts without claiming merit, achieves without taking credit, and does not seek to display virtue.\n\n**Luóshī** said: Having attained this emptiness and openness, free from thought and deliberation, how could one’s mind and intellect desire to exalt their own wisdom and ability? The sage acts without arrogance, achieves without self-satisfaction.\n\n「If one relies on their actions to claim merit and achievement, then they will be seen as virtuous, and such virtue will inevitably lead to the self-serving path of using excess to invite loss.\n\nThis chapter speaks of the Dao/Way of Heaven, where moderation is supreme. Thus, it suppresses the high to elevate the low, reduces the excessive to supplement the insufficient. The sage follows Heaven’s Dao, not relying on actions or achievements to display their virtue, so they receive benefits without suffering loss. Only those who understand Heaven’s Dao can do this.\n\n**Chapter 78: The Soft and Weak of the World**\n\nNothing in the world is as soft and weak as water, yet nothing can surpass it in overcoming hardness and strength. There is no substitute for it.\n\n**Lǚ Jífǔ** said: Among all things in the world, only water can conform to the curves and straightness, angles and roundness of objects, flowing with them. Thus, nothing is as soft and weak as water. Yet it can carry great vessels, turn massive stones, pierce steep cliffs and valleys, and float and bear all things under Heaven—only water can do this. Hence, nothing can surpass it in overcoming hardness and strength. This is so because, though it twists and changes in myriad ways, it never loses its essence as water. This is why there is no substitute for it. Water adapts to all things yet never alters itself, for its softness and weakness. If people can embody this, though they face countless transformations, their minds remain steadfast and unchanging. Thus, they can overcome all things without harm.\n\nTherefore, the soft overcomes the hard, the weak overcomes the strong. All under Heaven know this, yet none can practice it.\n\n**Hé Shànggōng** said: The tongue is soft, the teeth are hard, yet the teeth perish before the tongue. Water can extinguish fire, yin can consume yang. Those who know the enduring nature of softness and weakness, and the harm that comes to hardness and strength, should be ashamed of their arrogance and fondness for aggression. Hence, the sage speaks of this.\n\nThis refers to the following text.\n\nTo bear a nation’s impurities is called the **Duo Ji** sovereign.\nTo bear a nation’s misfortunes is called the **King of All Under Heaven**.\n\n**Wang Yuanzhe** said: The Sage’s ability to embody softness and weakness lies in taking water as his virtue.\n\nTo bear a nation’s misfortunes—does this not mean embracing filth and enduring humiliation?\n\nTo draw all the world’s crimes upon oneself is to receive the nation’s impurities and filth.\nThus, as a ruler of a single state, he calls himself *\"lonely,\" \"widowed,\" \"unworthy\"*—this is to bear the nation’s misfortunes.\nHence, all under Heaven turn toward him.\n\n**Right speech as if reversed.**\n\n**Wang Yuanzhe** said: Reversed for the petty wisdom of near-emotion, yet aligned with the utmost rectitude of the Dao.\n\n**Su Ziyou** said: Right speech aligns with the Dao yet opposes convention. The common folk see bearing impurities as shame, bearing misfortunes as calamity—thus it is.\n\nThis chapter speaks of softness and weakness overcoming hardness and strength.\nHence, it first uses water as an analogy, then cites the Sage’s words to confirm it.\n\n---\n**Chapter 79: Harmonizing Great Grievances**\n\nTo harmonize great grievances will inevitably leave lingering grievances—how then can it be called good?\n\n**Lü Jifu** said: Those who seek vengeance do not break their spears; though they harbor resentment, they do not blame the wind and tiles. Thus, the world attains balance. If one does not follow this path, grievances will only multiply. Yet people still strive to harmonize them endlessly.\n\nThus it is said: To harmonize great grievances will inevitably leave lingering grievances.\n\n*\"The unvirtuous, I too treat with virtue\"*—this is how one cultivates true virtue.\n\nTo harmonize great grievances yet still leave lingering grievances—how then can it be called good?\n\nA ruler cannot avoid action, yet if he is humble, yielding, and soft, the people will grow greedy and quarrelsome, and grievances and hatreds will flourish.\n\nIf the ruler enacts laws to restrain them—those who kill are put to death, those who injure are punished—yet if he harmonizes and repays their grievances, how can deceit grow worse and hatreds multiply? How then can it be called good?\n\nThus, the Sage holds the **left contract**.\n\n**Hé Shànggōng** said: In ancient times, the Sage held the left contract, using inscribed tablets and matching seals as proof.\n\nWithout written laws or statutes, they carved contracts and matching seals to establish trust.\n\n**Lü Xisheng** said: In ancient times, they tied knots to make agreements, and the people did not deceive. They split wood into contracts, and the people did not violate them. Why? Because the Sage had no fixed intentions—he took the people’s hearts as his own.\n\nThus, the Sage’s heart and the people’s hearts were like left and right contracts. When the contract came, they aligned without blame, so ruler and subjects grew close, and grievances did not arise.\n\n**Li Rong** said: In ancient times, the Sage carved wooden contracts—the ruler held the left, the subject the right—as proof, sealing them with matching seals. They did not rely on laws or statutes, imposing no penalties on things, hence *\"without blaming others.\"*\n\nThus, without punishment or blame, what grievances could there be to harmonize?\n\n**Wang Bi** said: The left contract prevents the origin of grievances, yet does not blame others.\n\n**Lü Jifu** said: Thus, the Sage holds the left contract without blaming others—this is how those who seek vengeance do not break their spears, though they harbor resentment, they do not blame the wind and tiles, and the world attains balance through this path.\n\nIndeed, in ancient times, those who offered oxen and horses held the right contract—the right contract was for taking, the left for giving. Thus, the left contract was always given to others, never held as possession.\n\nThe Sage acts yet does not rely on it; when his work is done, he does not claim it. He always gives in abundance to the world. Even when killing, he lets officials execute, yet never takes personal responsibility—this is holding the left contract, giving to others without possession, the way of having no grievances and not blaming others.\n\nIs this not because harmony is not a source of joy?\n\n**Wang Yuanzhe** said: The left contract takes from others; the right contract takes from people. The left is without action, the right holds authority—thus the ancient division of contracts was so.\n\nThe Sage holds the left contract, not interfering in things, yet things come to align with him. He responds to their alignment—this is called *\"responding and thus communicating with all under Heaven.\"*\n\nThen, the Sage always bears the world’s blame yet harbors no blame toward others—thus, he remains without grievance.\n\n**Zhuangzi** said: *\"To gain is attributed to others; to lose is attributed to oneself.\"* **Tang** said: *\"All under Heaven have faults; the fault lies with me.\"* This is what is meant.\n\n*The Records* say: Those who offered oxen and horses held the right token—clearly, the offering party presented both tokens together, so the left token was held by the one bearing responsibility.\n\n*The Historical Records* say: The right contract was used to demand accountability.\n\nThus, the virtuous hold the contracts;\n\n**Wang Yuanzhe** said: Not interfering in things, yet responding to their alignment.\n\n**Yan Xian** said: Seeking within oneself.\n\nA virtuous ruler oversees the contracts and trust, preventing grievances from arising, and only then does he blame others.\n\nThe unvirtuous oversee **through** (彻).\n\n**Hé Shànggōng** said: The unvirtuous ruler betrays his contracts and trust, overseeing others’ failures.\n\n**Yan Xian** said: Seeking without.\n\n**Shu Wang** said: If one oversees *through* (彻) to the end of matters, he cannot avoid blaming others. If he cannot avoid blaming others, he cannot make others without grievance—this is why he is unvirtuous.\n\n*彻*, to penetrate.\n\nThe unvirtuous seek to penetrate all things, yet harbor the heart of harmony and grievance.\n\nMercy is penetration.\n\nIs this not the source of obstruction?\n\nThus it is said: *\"Joy in penetrating things is not the Sage’s way.\"*\n\nThe Dao of Heaven has no favorites; it always aligns with the virtuous.\n\n**Commentary:** If virtuous, it aligns with them—what favoritism is there?\n\n**Lü Jifu** said: Without favoritism, yet aligning only with the virtuous—this too is the way of holding the left contract without blaming others.\n\n**Wang Yuanzhe** said: Only Heaven is without intention, yet it clearly aligns with virtue—Heaven and the Sage share the same path.\n\nThis chapter speaks of how having the heart to harmonize grievances is not as good as having no heart and merely overseeing contracts. To harmonize grievances will inevitably leave lingering grievances; to oversee contracts is to not blame others.\n\n「The Dao of Heaven has no favorites—only the virtuous does it favor, and this is also the way of holding the left contract without blaming others.\n\n**Chapter Eighty of *The Dao of the Small State and Few People* (*Xiǎoguó guǎmín*):**\nThe Small State and Few People.\n**River Master** said: Though the Sage governs a great state, he still treats it as small, demonstrating frugality and restraint, not indulging in extravagance. Though the people are many, they are treated as if few—so no one dares to burden them.\n\n**Zang Xuanjing** said: A state with little land is a small state. A people with few soldiers is few people.\n\n**Wang Yuanzhe** said: In a small state with few people, the populace is pure and honest. But in a great state with many people, interests and harms clash, and crafty deceits arise. Observe the people in the capital and those in the rural settlements—their manners differ starkly between guile and sincerity. Thus, a small state means simple governance, and few people mean honest folk. Simple governance and honest folk can restore the administration of the Great Ancients.\n\nThough there are implements for every ten or hundred households, they are not used.\n**Duke Shou of Shu** said: If the people are few, then my needs are also narrow. Thus, in a small state with few people, even if there are implements for every ten or hundred households, they are not used.\n\n**Wang Yuanzhe** said: Implements shared by ten households are called *shí* instruments. Implements shared by a hundred households are called *bǎi* instruments. Under the governance of simplicity and stillness, the aim is to let the people fulfill their natural inclinations without needless labor or contrivance, so there will never be matters of collective migration or warfare. Hence, though implements exist for every ten or hundred households, they are not used.\n\nLet the people value death and not seek distant resettlement.\n**River Master** said: If a ruler can create benefits and remove harms for the people, ensuring each finds their proper place, then the people will value death over life and cherish their existence. If governance and commands are not burdensome, the people will be content with their occupations and thus will not seek distant resettlement, abandoning their familiar dwellings.\n\n**Wang Yuanzhe** said: Those who find joy in life and fulfill their nature will value death. Those who are at peace with their land and have no desires will not seek distant resettlement. Those who value death do not lightly regard life. Those who share life with others but do not value their own existence are different. Those who do not seek distant resettlement are at peace in their homes. Those who scatter among the myriad people and are not at peace in their homes are different.\n\nThough there are boats and carriages, they have no need to ride them.\nThough there are armor and weapons, they have no need to display them.\n**Commentary:** There are no urgent journeys across perilous terrain, so though boats and carriages exist, they are not used. There are no battles to be fought, so though armor and weapons exist, they are not displayed.\n\n**Zanwei** said: Hollowing wood makes boats, to ferry across water; carving wheels makes carriages, to traverse land. These are for distant travel. In an age of non-action, mountains have no paths or tunnels, marshes have no boats or bridges—since travel is already severed, what need for riding or display?\n\n**Zhang Junxiang** said: Weapons are used to punish rebels, martial might to quell disorder. Once the ruler upholds the Dao, the people naturally turn to virtue and follow transformation—why would there be need to display weapons?\n\nBoats and carriages are metaphors for the *Small Vehicle* (小乘), armor and weapons for the *Small Wisdom* (小智). When the people’s hearts are at ease, these are truly abandoned and unused.\n\n**Wang Yuanzhe** said: If the people suffice within their natural endowments, then there will be no calamities of distant travel or warfare.\n\n**Cao Daochong** said: Great states do not encroach; small states defend their lands. Armor, helmets, spears, and halberds—why use them if there is no war?\n\nLet the people return to using knotted cords to record matters.\n**Wang Yuanzhe** said: Governance is simple, the people are honest—so there is no need for written contracts.\n\n**Emperor Xuanzong of Tang** said: Boats and carriages are for the convenience of migration; armor and weapons are for waging war. Since both are not desired, they are not used, and the people revert to simplicity, returning to the use of knotted cords.\n\n**Explication:** In ancient times, before writing was invented, knotted cords were used to record events. Thus, the *Systematic Discourse* says: \"In the Upper Antiquity, knotted cords were used for governance; later, the Sages replaced them with written contracts, desiring to show that in the age of knotted cords, people were all pure and simple.\" Once writing emerged, deceit and artifice grew daily. Now, to make people forget their emotions and desires and return to purity and simplicity, it is said: \"Let the people return to using knotted cords.\"\n\nLet their food be simple, their clothing fine, their dwellings secure, and their customs joyous.\n**Commentary:** They till the soil and eat; they weave and wear. With mouths full, they play; with bellies satisfied, they wander. If the people can attain this, then:\n- Stopping at what is proper makes food sweet.\n- Removing ornamentation makes clothing fine.\n- Not being disturbed makes dwellings secure.\n- Preserving life makes customs joyous.\n\n**Emperor Xuanzong of Tang** said: Not coveting rich flavors makes their food always sweet. Not laboring over embroidered patterns makes their clothing always fine. Not adorning their homes makes their dwellings secure. Not corrupting simplicity and purity makes their customs joyous.\n\nNeighboring states are visible to one another, and the sounds of roosters and dogs can be heard. Yet the people die of old age without ever visiting each other.\n\n**Wang Yuanzhe** said: This is the governance of fulfilling nature, and the people also fulfill their nature. I have often examined the closing passages of *The Analects* and *Mencius*—both end by praising the virtuous deeds of Yao, Shun, Yu, and Tang. It seems that if one applies this book to governance, its effects will match those of the Sages of those ages.\n\nLaozi was the greatest Sage. Yet the changes he encountered were precisely when the world reverted to its original simplicity and fulfillment of nature. Thus, he alone illuminated the meaning of *virtue* and *power* (德道), gathering scattered matters and uniting them in simplicity and sincerity. If one applies his book to governance, the people will transform and customs will flourish—this chapter’s effect is proof of it. Hence, the *Text’s* intent concludes here.\n\n**Lü Jifu** said: Since the Three Dynasties, until the decline of Zhou, its culture became greatly corrupted. The people lost their natural and vital essence, so Laozi’s words saved them by emphasizing simplicity and returning to the governance of the Great Ancients. Yet the words of *The Book of Poetry* and *The Book of Documents* only reach as far as Yao, Shun, and the Three Dynasties—why does Laozi seek to return to the governance of the Great Ancients?\n\nHe replied: The Dao and the world have long corrupted each other. Only the Great Dao can make people return to their natural and vital essence. If one speaks of the Dao without addressing its worldly manifestations, one cannot truly know that the Great Dao has already been tested. This is why it must necessarily return to the Great Ancient Dao.»\n\nThe world has long departed from the Great Ancient Dao—can it all be restored?\nHe said: Not yet.\n\nThen what is the purpose of his words?\nHe said: Ritual reached its fullness in the combined practices of the Three Kings, and music in the complete forms of the Six Dynasties. Yet even then, ritual did not place the *xuanshui* (玄水) and *dajīng* (大羹) beneath the *lìjiǔ* (醴酒) and harmonized soups, nor did music add the *huǐguǎn* (嘒管) and clear *qìngqìng* (清磬) above the *zhūxián* (朱弦) and sparse *shūyuè* (疏越)—this was to make people understand the true intent of ritual and music. What was unavoidable was to refine and return to the origins in this way.\n\nAt that time, Confucius was seeking to restore the lost traditions of Wen, Wu, and the Duke of Zhou, while Laozi expounded on the Dao to match the times—his intent was no different.\n\nIt is like the month of *sì* (巳) when fire reigns, yet the *jīn* (金) qi has already emerged within it. This is how the Five Phases succeed one another without interruption.\n\nThus, though the ancients had tenfold or hundredfold tools yet did not use them, had boats and carriages yet did not ride them, had armor and weapons yet did not display them, when great matters arose, they gathered the people—this was unavoidable. Though their people used knotted cords for records, neighboring states were within sight and hearing, yet they grew old and died without visiting one another, it was only when governance grew burdensome, when officials were pressed to enforce laws and supervise travel, that footsteps reached the borders of neighboring states and carriage tracks stretched beyond a thousand *lǐ*—this too was unavoidable.\n\nWhat was unavoidable was always here, yet what they sought to restore was always there.\n\nThen would the Sage not weary of elaborate governance to correct the people’s excesses?\n\nYet if one seeks a world that is not at peace and prosperity, it cannot be attained. Even if he spoke no more, still he would have set aside the *xuanshui* and removed the *shūyuè*—who would know the ritual’s true simplicity and the music’s moderation, or the intent to return to the origins?\n\nThe words of the Sage—how could they be mere trifles?\n\nWhen neighbors live close yet do not interact, when voices are heard but no demands are made, this is the utmost of *wuqiú* (无求). This chapter speaks of small states and few people, where governance is simple and the people pure—thus the Great Ancient Dao could be restored. From the time of knotted cords onward, all was the Great Ancient Dao.\n\nIf one truly upholds this book to transform the people, such restoration could be achieved.\n\n*\"Sincere words are not ornate\"* (信言不美), Chapter Eighty-One.\n\nShū Wáng said: *\"Sincere\"* is nature. When words approach nature, they are perfect, and this is the utmost harmony of the world. Hence, sincere words are not ornate.\n\nTo govern the world, when the food is sweet, the clothing is fine, the dwelling is secure, the customs are joyful, and the aged die without mutual visits, then governance has reached its peak. If one then gathers and returns to the Dao, this is why it follows with *\"sincere words are not ornate.\"*\n\nWáng Yuànzé said: *\"Sincere words\"* are essential to the Dao. The Dao expressed through speech is plain and without flavor—how could there be ornamentation?\n\n*\"Theft\"* speaks of excessive sweetness; sweetness is the beauty of flavor.\n*\"Prostitute\"* speaks of extravagance; extravagance is the beauty of color.\n*\"Craftsman\"* speaks like a bellows; bellows are the beauty of sound.\n*Sincere words* are those spoken in accordance with the Dao, plain and without flavor, yet not departing from the Dao. Speech without ornate words is not mere appearance. Speech without melodious charm is not mere empty rhetoric. This is why they are not ornate.\n\nOrnate words are not sincere.\n\nHéshàng Gōng said: Ornate words are embellished, flowery language. Insincerity is the adornment of falsehood and the proliferation of emptiness.\n\nJì Wáng said: If words are ornate, they cannot approach nature. Hence, ornate words are not sincere.\n\nWáng Yuànzé said: To speak of affairs without reference to the Dao, though it may please the shallow ears of the unenlightened, it is not profound discourse. Hence, it cannot be fully sincere.\n\nThe virtuous do not argue. Those who truly practice the Dao do not engage in debate or persuasion. Those who argue are not virtuous.\n\nTáng Mínghuáng said: Empty, hollow argumentation is why they are not virtuous.\n\nWáng Yuànzé said: Speech is only for illuminating the Dao. The Dao is concise and unburdened—why use excessive words?\n\nKǒngzǐ said: *\"The purpose of speech is to convey meaning.\"*\n\nThe wise are not all-knowing. *御注*: The wise grasp the subtleties of the Dao, returning to its essence. The *经* says: *\"Few words suffice.\"* *Zhuānwēi* says: The wise understand their Dao. They are clear in principle and know its roots, obtaining its essence alone—why need they be all-knowing? This is what is meant by *\"few words suffice.\"* Those who are all-knowing are not truly wise. *御注*: The more one hears and sees, the more one should simplify.\n\nZhuāngzǐ said: *\"Extensive knowledge is not necessarily profound; eloquence and debate are not necessarily wise.\"*\n\nHéshàng Gōng said: Those who are all-knowing have many experiences but lose the essence and truth.\n\nSū Zǐyóu said: *\"If one has a single thread that unifies all things, then there is no need for extensive knowledge—yet daily growth does not necessarily mean understanding the Dao.\"*\n\nThe Sage does not accumulate.\n\nWáng Bì said: Without private possession, one naturally has abundance; only goodness is given, and things are fulfilled as they come. When one gives to others, one’s own abundance increases. When one gives to others, one’s own abundance grows ever more.\n\nWáng Yuànzé said: *\"To act for others\"* means to apply oneself to affairs and governance of the world. To follow their momentum and benefit them, then one’s Dao is not diminished, and one’s affairs become ever more expansive. *\"To give to others\"* means to impart the Dao. To impart the Dao is like the heavens giving birth to things—I have never expended anything, yet things multiply daily. Since it is said *\"the Sage does not accumulate,\"* it is also clarified that one can satisfy all things. Only by not accumulating can one truly suffice.\n\nCáo Dàochōng said: *\"The richness of boundless generosity is inexhaustible; the response of non-accumulation is limitless. Marvelous use arises daily, and the more one seeks, the more one finds—great generosity gives daily, and the more one takes, the more one prospers.\"* If one accumulates, then there is insufficiency. If one has no hoarding, then there is abundance.\n\nThe Sage’s non-accumulation is also mere emptiness. Emptiness is why one can respond to all demands, while fullness cannot be diminished. This is how one gives to others—one’s own abundance increases, and the more one gives to others, the more one’s own abundance grows.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven benefits without harming; *御注*: Though the *乾* begins by benefiting and sweetly nourishing the world, it does not speak of what it benefits, yet all things are truly benefited by it—never does it cause harm.\n\nLú Yù said: Human affairs benefit one thing while harming another. The Dao of Heaven is balanced, so there is benefit without harm.\n\nGù Huān said: The virtuous obtain the Dao to fulfill their nature; the wicked obtain the Dao to transform their nature. All return to the One, benefiting without harming.\n\nHeaven follows the Dao, hence in spring and summer it nurtures and grows, while in autumn and winter it matures and ripens. This is benefiting without harming.\n\nThe Sage’s Dao acts without striving. Lǚ Jìfǔ said: *\"The words of Lǎozǐ—when observing inwardly the hearts of all, outwardly all things, upward to Heaven, and downward to Earth—there is nothing that does not accord with them. This is sincerity. Yet the common scholar hears them and laughs, the world thinks them like the unworthy. This is not ornate. When speech is most natural, its meaning is most profound—this is virtue. Yet they do not delight in speech—this is not argumentative. Their wisdom reaches to no-wisdom—this is wisdom. Yet their simplicity never departs from my heart—this is not all-knowing. Yet scholars seek ornamentation, argumentation, and extensive knowledge, and thus they are distant. The Dao of Lǎozǐ—though the Sage’s wisdom, it still rejects and abandons accumulation. Hence, reaching to no-accumulation, it satisfies all demands of things, and this is why one’s own abundance increases and grows ever more. Yet scholars cannot carve their hearts here, and thus they cannot attain this Dao. All things have what benefits them and what does not benefit them. What does not benefit them cannot avoid harming them. Only Heaven’s Dao—having no benefit, there is no non-benefit; having no non-benefit, it benefits without harming. All things that act—none do not have ‘self.’ Having ‘self’ means having strife. Only the Sage’s Dao—though acting, it is without action. Being without action means without ‘self,’ and without ‘self’ means without strife. This is the Dao of Heaven alone. The Sage follows Heaven’s Dao—though acting, it arises from non-action. Transformation and fulfillment occur in affairs, yet there is no strife with things. Thus, one’s sagely accomplished deeds are preserved.\"*\n\nThis chapter summarizes the essence of the *经*, speaking in accordance with the Dao. The Dao is plain and without flavor, hence it is not ornate.\n\nThe Way is spoken of to illuminate the Dao, hence it is not embroidered.\nThe Dao is essential and not burdensome, hence it is not extensive.\nThe Sage embodies the Dao, hence does not accumulate.\nThus, when one attains the utmost of having no need to fulfill the demands of all things, the more one has, the more one possesses.\nHeaven follows the Dao, hence benefits without harming.\nThe Sage follows Heaven, hence acts without strife.\n\nIf one truly seeks to embody the teachings of Dao and virtue, there is none more exalted than benefiting things while not engaging in strife, hence this is where it concludes.\n\nDao and virtue, when unified, are discussed before form takes shape. Before form, Dao and virtue are both hidden.\nAfter form appears, Dao and virtue are both revealed.\nWhat is Dao? That which all things follow is Dao.\nWhat is virtue? That which is inherent within Dao is virtue.\n\nWhen viewed from their differences, Dao and virtue, though bearing two names, are distinct.\nWhen viewed from their unity, Dao and virtue, though named separately, remain inseparable in essence.\nDao descends as virtue, yet virtue has never been separate from Dao.\nVirtue arises from Dao, yet Dao has never been separate from virtue.\n\nThe *Nanhua Jing* states:\n\"From the One, there arises a One yet unformed. That all things obtain from this to be born is called virtue.\nWhen spoken of as the One yet unformed, it is called Dao.\nWhen spoken of as that from which all things obtain to be born, it is called virtue.\"\n\nAgain it says:\n\"Virtue encompasses the unity of Dao.\nWhen Dao and virtue are united, they blend as one.\nWhen separated, they scatter as two.\nNow, those who speak of the *Daode Jing* are correct.\nThose who speak of the *Dao Jing* and the *De Jing* separately are not.\n\nLater scholars, seeing the first chapter of the upper text and taking its words ‘Dao that can be spoken of,’ named it the *Dao Jing*.\nSeeing the first chapter of the lower text and taking its words ‘the utmost virtue is not virtue,’ named it the *De Jing*.\nThus arises the division of Dao and virtue.\n\nIf the upper text speaks only of Dao, how then does it mention the fullness of virtue’s manifestation?\nIt follows Dao alone, yet Dao does not depart from virtue.\nIf the lower text speaks only of virtue, how then does it say ‘Dao gives birth, virtue nourishes’?\nIt is virtue that does not depart from Dao.\n\nExamined through the text, Dao and virtue mutually depend upon each other and cannot be considered in isolation.\nWhen one attempts to discuss this, Dao without virtue cannot be revealed, and virtue without Dao cannot be illuminated.\nDao is without action and without form, hence it precedes the transformation of all things.\nVirtue has application and action, hence it follows after the generation and transformation of things.\nDao precedes, hence it is placed above.\nVirtue follows, hence it is placed below.\nDao and virtue, when united, are one; they cannot be divided into two.\n\nThe *Xisheng Jing* states:\n\"Dao and virtue united is to be in harmony with the Dao.\"\n\nThe *Nanhua Jing* states:\n\"Form does not arise from Dao without generation.\nGeneration does not proceed from virtue without illumination.\nExhausting form and probing generation,\nEstablishing virtue and illuminating Dao.\"\n\nFrom this, it is clear that Dao and virtue mutually depend upon each other and are not separate.\n\nMaster Sima Wen Gong summarized the essence, and the Grand Historian said:\n\"The Master Laozi wrote the upper and lower chapters, speaking of the meaning of Dao and virtue.\nLater scholars, following the titles from the opening words of each chapter,\nNamed the upper chapter the *Dao Jing* and the lower chapter the *De Jing*.\nDao and virtue are inherently connected and cannot be considered in isolation.\nNow we adhere to the original name.\nThe *Daode Jing*—the True Classic of Dao and Virtue—takes its entirety from the *Shan Ji* (卷十二).\"",

Thus, he sought to restore the simplicity of the ancient Dao, expounding the profound winds of mysticism to rouse the common folk—even to the point of scorn for virtue and morality, rejecting ritual and scholarship. Indeed, his words were so piercingly direct that they could not be bent by falsehood; hence, Confucius held him in reverence.\n\nUpon seeing it, Confucius sighed, *\"It is like a dragon!\"*—only the sage knows the sage, and so he spoke.\n\nGuan Yin (关尹) beheld the auspicious purple vapor and recognized the True Person (真人) crossing the pass. With devout sincerity, he knelt and pleaded for instruction, and only then did the Master descend his profound teachings.\n\nCritics often say that the Five Classics (五经) are vast yet inferior to the two chapters of this text in brevity—truly, there is reason for this.\n\nZhuang Zhou (庄周) and Lie Yu (列御寇) expanded its teachings, as if stirring great waves in the boundless sea or raising towering peaks upon lofty mountains. Yet even this only approximates its edges without fully grasping its intent. Only when one forgets words does one truly recognize its guiding principles.\n\nDuring the reigns of Emperor Wen (文) and Emperor Jing (景) of the Han Dynasty, governance favored simplicity and tranquility, and the empire flourished in peace. This was due to the guidance of Cao Can (曹参), who followed the teachings of Gao Gong (盖公), proving the efficacy of the Dao De’s virtue (德) in transforming the world—indeed, the Master’s lament was not in vain.\n\nIn the Jin Dynasty, however, the Dao degenerated into frivolous fancy. Wang Xuan (王衍) indulged in empty discourse, undermining the pure traditions. Ruan Ji (阮籍) raged recklessly, further destroying the foundations of moral order. To abandon the root and follow only the branches—how could one not grieve?\n\nFortunately, the Sui scholar Wang Zhongyan (王仲淹) deeply understood its nature, declaring that *\"the Dao’s emptiness was prolonged, and the Jin Dynasty thus declined—not the fault of Laozi and Zhuangzi, but because their teachings were misapplied.\"*\n\nIn the Tang Dynasty, Han Yu (韩愈) still mocked its minimalism as *\"petty virtue, like a frog in a well viewing the heavens.\"* Alas, Han Yu squandered his brilliance while ignorant of the Dao—he was deaf and blind in spirit, unable to perceive how the thunder of Tai Mountain (太山) could shake his ears and dazzle his sight.\n\nTo call this lack of wisdom, and to earn the sighs of the virtuous—how lamentable!\n\nDevout adherents have never been lacking across generations, each interpreting the text according to their own understanding. Their commentaries number in the tens, making it difficult both to read and to compile.\n\nLi Lin (李霖) of Rao Yang (饶阳), styled Zong Fu (宗傅), was by nature serene and unassuming, steadfast from youth to old age. He dedicated himself to studying the Five Thousand Characters (五千之文), embodying the resolve of *\"knowing the lofty and noble as worthy of emulation, forgetting the labor of probing and analyzing.\"* He gathered the finest interpretations from various schools, blending them with his own insights, and produced six volumes.\n\nJust as the Eight Tones (八音) differ yet harmonize to the ear, or the Five Flavors (五味) vary yet please the palate—so too does this work.",

      "translated_text": "The purpose is to broaden understanding and enrich knowledge, thereby aiding fellow practitioners of the Way. Its contributions, though modest, are by no means insignificant.\n\nWang Bin was the Master’s old friend, and in admiration of his diligence and fulfillment of his aspirations, he commissioned artisans to engrave the text onto wooden blocks, sparing those who cherish the Way the labor of manual transcription. His thoughtful generosity can hardly be called anything but benevolent.\n\nThis was in the year *Dàdìng* *Rénchén* (大定壬辰), on the *Chóngwǔ* day (重午), prefaced by the River Interval Scholar Liu Yunsheng (河间刘允升).\n\nAll things derive from the Dao.\nThe Dao within us is virtue/power (*dé*).\nThe Dao is subtle and formless, its transformations unfathomable.\nVirtue/power is manifest and substantial—yet all is virtue/power.\nFrom its differences, it appears as two names.\nFrom its unity, its essence remains singular.\n\nThe unlearned speak of the Dao yet often overlook virtue/power.\nThose who speak of virtue/power invariably include the Dao.\nThus, the separation of Dao and virtue/power obscures their perfect unity.\n\nJust as the Dragon, the Supreme Sage, lamented the decay of nature and life at the end of the Shang dynasty, and pitied the decline of Dao and virtue/power, he composed *Nine Times Nine* chapters to illuminate the most profound mysteries. His words did not exceed the *Five Thousand Characters*, yet their meaning permeated the Three Teachings. Internally, it teaches cultivation of the heart and nurturing of life; externally, it guides governance and the pacification of the people—being the foremost principle for all speech and the origin of all things. It encompasses the vast without omission, the minute without neglect. Its language is concise, its meaning profound—vast and boundless indeed.\n\nSince the advent of written records, no text has surpassed this Scripture in its profundity. Though many have since commented upon it, few have grasped its entirety. Each interprets according to their own perspective, with inevitable gains and losses. Those who comprehend nature may attain the subtle mysteries of the Perfect Spirit, yet their understanding of life may remain incomplete. Those who master life may grasp the essential keys to longevity, yet their grasp of nature may be insufficient.\n\nYet truly, nature and life are inseparable—Dao and virtue/power are one.\n\nFrom my youth to maturity, I recited the Mysterious Words in vain, awaiting the opportunity to answer inquiries. Now aged, I seek to delve into their deeper meanings to cultivate my own authenticity. Knowing my feeble understanding cannot fathom the Sage’s intent, I have gathered the finest interpretations of others and supplemented them with my own, not to enlighten later generations, but for the convenience of reference. I have titled it *The Gathering of the Virtuous* (*Qǔshànjí*), hoping readers will not scorn it.\n\n**Prefatory Remarks to *The Gathering of the Virtuous* from the Rao Yang Recluse Li Lin**\n*Dao and Virtue/Power Classic – The Gathering of the Virtuous, Volume One*\n*Collected Works of the Song Dynasty Rao Yang Recluse Li Lin*\n\n**Imperial Annotation:**\nThe Dao is the path all share.\nVirtue/power is what the heart attains on its own.\nThe Dao endures through all ages without decay.\nVirtue/power fills the nature and remains ever-present.\n\nLaozi, in the declining years of the Zhou, saw the Dao descend while virtue/power waned, and thus composed *Nine Times Nine* chapters to clarify the eternal principles of Dao and virtue/power, calling it the *Classic*. Its words are simple, its meaning profound—students must ponder it in silence and strive deeply to master it.\n\n**Chapter One: The Dao That Can Be Spoken Of**\n\nThe Dao that can be spoken of is not the Eternal Dao.\nThe name that can be named is not the Eternal Name.\n\nYán Zhūn remarked: *\"The Dao that can be spoken of is the manifest virtue/power, not the natural and spontaneous.\"*\n\nToday’s practitioners do not carry torches by day because the sun shines naturally.\nThe natural brightness of the sun is the Eternal Dao.\nCarrying torches is the manifest Dao.\n\nWhat can be inscribed on bamboo and silk, carved into metal and stone, and passed down to others—this is the Dao that can be spoken of.\nYet there is also the Dao that can be transmitted but not received, obtained but not seen—its origin and root precede Heaven and Earth, existing since antiquity. It is the eternal Dao that gives birth to gods, spirits, Heaven, and Earth.\n\nThe profundity of the *Five Thousand Characters* is unfolded in these few words—truly, the Mysterious beyond the Mysterious, the Divine beyond the Divine.\n\nWang Yuanzé said: *\"Names arise from reality. Reality has form and measure; once form and measure are established, decay follows inevitably. How then can it be eternal? Only by grasping this impermanence can one attain true permanence.\"*\n\nThe opening phrase introduces *Dao*—the Great Dao.\nThe subsequent phrase, *\"the Dao that can be spoken of,\"* refers to the Dao of speech.\n\nThe Great Dao is empty and tranquil; its principles are profound and unfathomable. It cannot be spoken of, only grasped in silent understanding. Thus, the mind is perplexed and unable to comprehend, the tongue falters and cannot articulate—it must be intuitively realized within the spirit’s depths.\n\nEven the word *Dao* itself cannot be spoken.\nIf left unspoken, the common folk follow it without knowing.\nThus, the Sage, unable to bear silence, named it *Dao*.\nOnce named, speech and explanation arise, waxing and waning in succession—this is not the Eternal Dao.\n\nWhat can be spoken of is all the Dao, yet it is not the Eternal Dao.\nOnly what cannot be spoken of can be eternal.\n\nNow, Confucian virtues like *rén* (仁, benevolence), *yì* (义, righteousness), *lǐ* (礼, propriety), and *zhì* (智, wisdom) are the Dao that can be spoken of yet cannot be eternal.\nOnly when they cannot be spoken of—when *rén* is *rén*, *yì* is *yì*, *lǐ* is *lǐ*, and *zhì* is *zhì*—do they remain unchanging while the Dao endures. Thus, the eternal Dao that cannot be spoken of is the natural and spontaneous, responding to stimuli and transforming without end, interacting with all things exhaustively. It cannot be transmitted through words or sought through intellect—only by embodying the mysterious workings of nature, containing light and concealing radiance, doing nothing yet accomplishing all, silently attaining its utmost.\n\nThe nameless is the beginning of Heaven and Earth.\nThe named is the mother of all things.\n\nWén Gōng remarked: *\"Heaven and Earth are the greatest of forms. Their origin must derive from the nameless, hence the beginning of Heaven and Earth is called *nameless*. All things are born through form, their birth depending on the named, hence the mother of all things is called *named*.\"*\n\nLǚ Jìfǔ said: *\"The nameless is the Dao, from which Heaven and Earth originate. Thus, it is called the *nameless*, the beginning of Heaven and Earth.*\n\n*Before the beginning, there was the nameless and the unnamed.*\n*The unnamed gave rise to the named.*\n\n*Without the unnamed, even Oneness cannot be attained.*\n*The named is the origin of Oneness.*\n\n*With Oneness yet unformed, this is the beginning of Heaven and Earth.\"*",

      "translated_text": "Then what is the distinction between virtue/power and non-virtue/non-power?\n\nThe Sage embodies the unchanging truth while always manifesting,\nand transcends wondrous application while remaining non-attached—\nbeauty, ugliness, virtue/power, non-virtue/non-power,\nall are but simplified illusions, beyond comprehension.\nWhy then should non-virtue/non-power be a burden?\n\nMaster Wang Yuanze said:\n*\"Non-virtue/non-power and non-goodness are the companions of virtue/power and goodness.\nWhen virtue/power and goodness are in play,\nnon-virtue/non-power and non-goodness are already present.\nTo await their emergence and then realize it—\nthat is but late enlightenment.\nBeauty and ugliness arise from deluded emotions,\nvirtue/power and non-virtue/non-power balance in the loss of true nature.\nThe beautiful is what human emotions cherish.\nIf one knows beauty as beauty,\nthen the mind has something it cherishes as beautiful.\nWhen the mind cherishes beauty,\nit brings affliction to itself—then ugliness arises.\nIf the River Spirit (河伯) rejoices exultantly,\nboasting that all the beauty of the world lies within him,\nhe cannot escape sighing at the vastness before him,\nalmost falling into error.\nThe virtuous is what humans desire.\nIf one knows virtue/power as virtue/power,\nthen true nature has something it desires.\nWhen true nature desires,\nit strays from the Dao/Way to cling to virtue/power—then non-virtue/non-power arises.\nIf Master Bi (伯夷) saw the name of virtue/power as desirable,\nstarving beneath Chief Yang (首阳),\nit was still a loss of true nature—almost falling into error.\nFor the Dao/Way’s beauty is the supreme beauty.\nSupreme beauty transcends beauty, serene beyond all taste.\nZhuangzi said:\n*'Faintly discerned, without limit—\nall beauties arise from it.*\nThe Dao/Way’s virtue/power is the highest virtue/power.\nHighest virtue/power forgets virtue/power,\nand all virtues/powers are complete.\nHe also said:\n*'Abandon virtue/power, and virtue/power itself is fulfilled.'*\nThis chapter unifies the Dao/Way as one,\nfearing that people will cling to beauty and virtue/power,\nand not awaken to the true and constant.\nThus it follows with this passage,\nresembling *Zhuangzi’s齐物论* [\"Discourse on Equalizing Things\"].\n\nThe interplay of presence and absence,\ndifficulty and ease,\nlength and shortness,\nheight and depth,\nsound and resonance,\nbefore and after—\nthese six pairs arise from the interplay of transformation (韦变),\nfrom myriad contemplations,\nfrom divergent paths,\nand are the means by which the world’s people\nare ensnared and cannot extricate themselves.\nAbsence generates presence without movement,\npresence returns to absence—\nhence it is said: *presence and absence intergenerate.*\nWhen presence encounters difficulty,\none knows ease in action—\nhence it is said: *difficulty and ease intercomplete.*\nLength and shortness define each other,\nas with the ruler’s measurements.\nHeight and depth incline toward one another,\nas with mountains and valleys.\nA sound ascends and its echo responds—\nhence it is said: *sound and resonance harmonize.*\nA form moves and its shadow follows—\nhence it is said: *before and after interfollow.*\nThe circulation of yin and yang,\nthe progression of the four seasons,\nthe principles of all things—\nsuddenly formed, then suddenly vanished.\nTheir difficulty is like the labor of contrivance (有为) in governing the world,\ntheir ease is like the effortlessness of non-action (无为) in aligning with oneself.\nWhat is long in nature is not to be severed,\nwhat is short in nature is not to be prolonged.\nHeaven’s own height, Earth’s own depth,\nstriking the gong of the palace (宫) and the palace resounds,\nstriking the gong of the ram’s horn (角) and the ram’s horn answers.\nSpring precedes and summer follows,\nthe long precedes and the young follow—\nthough all these paired realms dwell within the Dao/Way,\nthey are far from its essence.\nMaster Wen (温公) said:\n*'Whatever has form and trace\nmust not be equalized.\nUnequalized, it leads to contention;\ncontention, to chaos;\nchaos, to exhaustion—\nthus the Sage does not value it.'*\nTherefore, the Sage dwells in non-action (无为) in his deeds,\nand practices the teaching of non-speech (不言).\nMaster Gu (顾欢) said:\n*'The Sage follows Heaven and entrusts to things,\ncreating nothing.\nHis mind ever steadfast,\nquiet before all.\nWhen beauty and virtue/power are at rest,\nthere is no contention—\nthus he is not swayed by the six realms.\nAction brings gain and loss,\nspeech brings right and wrong—\none cannot escape burdens.\nTherefore, the Sage in his affairs\nacts through non-action and teaches through non-speech,\nso that his heart remains serene,\nnever burdened by words,\nand the world returns to its constant,\nrecovering its simplicity.\nOnly when there are no burdens,\ndoes he, though dwelling between yin and yang,\ntranscend the power of creation,\nand those six pairs—\nhow could they disturb him?*\n\nThe *Classic* says:\n*\"The teaching of non-speech,\nthe benefit of non-action—\nfew under Heaven attain to them.\"*\nAll things act without refusal—\nthe *Commentary* states:\n*\"All things move and respond,\nsensing while reacting.\nLike a mirror reflecting forms,\nfair and foul appear without hesitation.\nLike a valley echoing sounds,\nbeauty and ugliness all respond—\nnothing is refused.\nNow, though the count of things\ndoes not stop at ten thousand,\nit is called ‘all things’ to signify their multitude.\n‘Act’ means to move and respond.\nAll things move and respond,\nthe Sage lets each fulfill its nature,\nnever refusing or obstructing,\nfor my heart is empty,\nneither taking nor discarding.\nIf one harbors thoughts of taking or discarding,\nthen the myriad forms of things—\nbeauty, ugliness, and more—\nhow could one not refuse them?\"*\n\nTo give birth without possession,\nto act without reliance,\nto complete the work without claiming it—\nMaster Zuan Wei (纂微) said:\n*\"All things generate themselves,\neach standing alone in transformation,\nnot possessed by me.\nThe myriad qualities strive in their own doing,\neach aligning with its own nature,\nnot relying on my virtue/power.\nWhen deeds are completed and affairs fulfilled,\nthe Dao/Way harmonizes with things,\nthe heart wanders at Mount Gu Shou (姑射),\nnot dwelling over the ten thousand people—\nthis is the Sage’s complete virtue/power.\nAll things generate themselves,\neach reaching their utmost height and grandeur.\nAll things act of their own accord,\neach rectifying their own life and fate.\nThe Sage attributes function to things,\nnot burdening himself with the three affairs—\nhence it is said:\n*'To complete the work without claiming it—\nif there is a self, then it claims.\nClaiming, it strays.'*\nEmperor Yao (帝尧) completed his work,\nyet saw himself as deficient.\nOnly when one does not claim,\ndoes one not stray.\nMaster Su Ziyou (苏子由) said:\n*\"The Sage dwells in poverty and humble station\nyet feels no poverty or humble station’s distress,\ndwells in wealth and honor\nyet feels no wealth or honor’s burden—\nthis is called ‘not claiming.’\nIf I do not claim,\nhow could others follow to claim?*\nThis is the ultimate claiming.\"*",

chapter speaks of the Sage embodying the **Dao/Way** of **wuwei** (無為) to govern.\n**Not prizing the virtuous, not valuing wealth,**\nemptying the heart and filling the belly,\nweakening the will and strengthening the bones—\nthis is the Sage embodying the **Dao/Way** to govern the body **without acting**.\n\n**To make the people not contend** and align with **wu zhi** (無知),\n**to make the people not steal** and align with **wu yu** (無欲),\nthen there is nothing left untamed.\n\nThe *Classic* (《經》) says:\n**\"The Dao/Way is ever without acting yet nothing remains unacted upon.**\nIf lords and kings could guard it,\nall things would naturally transform themselves.\nThe Sage who governs **without acting** is how **Yú Shùn** (虞舜) became Emperor.\nThe Sage who governs with **垂拱** (垂拱) is how **Zhōu Wǔ** (周武) became King.\nThus it is said:\n**Emperors and Kings govern without acting, and the realm is perfected.**\n\n**Chapter Four: The Dao/Way is Boundless** (道沖)\nThe Dao/Way is boundless,\nyet its use may appear as though it were not full.\n\n**御注** (Commentary):\n*\"The Dao/Way has sentiment and trust,\nhence it has use.\nWithout acting and without form,\nhence it is not full.\nBoundless (沖) means central (中).*\nThe Dao/Way’s use,\nthough it suppresses the high and elevates the low,\nreduces excess and supplements deficiency,\nhas no fixed course yet finds its center.\nThe Dao/Way’s essence,\nempty yet not full,\noverflowing yet without limit,\nnourishes all things yet never possesses—\nhence it is said to appear as though it were not full.\n\n**Abyssal (渊)**, it seems like the origin of all things.\n**Wēn Gōng** (温公) says:\n*\"Deep and unfathomable,\never the master of all things.\nAbyssal (渊) and flowing (反流) are one.*\nThe *Shuō Wén* (《说文》) says:\n*\"Returning water (回水).*\nWhen water returns, it is deep and still;\nwhen it returns and becomes an abyss (渊),\nit ceases to flow—\nthus, its unity is complete.\"\n\n**兮** (Ah) is a rhythmic aid in singing.\n**Zhuāngzǐ** (庄子) says:\n*\"The stillness of water is its abyss (渊).*\nThe abyss is deep and still,\nunmixed with things—\nthe essence of the Dao/Way.\nOnly its depth—\nno thing can fathom it.\nOnly its stillness—\nno thing can move it.\nThe Dao/Way’s essence is abyssal (渊), deep and still,\nappearing as the origin of all things.\nYet the Dao/Way itself has no inherent connection to things;\nit is the origin of itself alone—\nhence it is said to appear so.*\n\nAs for those who say \"appears\" (似),\nit is because they dare not speak directly of it.\n\n**Humans are originally sufficient within this Dao/Way;**\nthose who seek to embody it\nmust not seek it elsewhere.\nThey should blunt their sharpness,\nresolve their entanglements,\nharmonize their brilliance,\nand align with the dust—\nthen they will naturally preserve themselves.\n\n**Blunt their sharpness, resolve their entanglements,**\nharmonize their brilliance,\nand align with the dust.\n**Wēn Gōng** (温公) says:\n*\"The sharpness of edges and the fierceness of exposure—\nthese are what the Dao/Way abhors.\nTroublesome and chaotic affairs—\nthese are what the Dao/Way despises.\nDazzling radiance and ostentatious display—\nthese are the Dao/Way’s ruin.\nHumility and obscurity—\nthese are what the Dao/Way values.*\n\nWhen the heart strays outward and mingles with things,\nthat is sharpness—\nblunt it and do not act.\nWhen things arrive and the heart becomes entangled,\nthat is entanglement—\nresolve it and do not be disordered.\nTo blunt sharpness and resolve entanglements,\nthe nature and emotions settle,\nand naturally become full and radiant.\n\nOnce radiance is present,\nit is not fundamentally different from things—\nharmonized and aligned yet not displayed,\nthis is called **light yet not blinding** (光而不耀).\nWithin, it does not lose its truth;\nwithout, it does not differ from the common—\naligned with the dust yet unstained,\nthis is called **committing with things and aligning with their waves** (與物委蛇，而同其波).\n\n**Serene (湛)**, it seems as though it might be preserved.\n**Guō Xiàng** (郭象) says:\n*\"Preserved (存) means 'to exist.'\nThe Dao/Way is serene and tranquil,\nunchanging from ancient to present,\nconstant from beginning to end—\nhence it is said to exist.\nYet it exists without things—\nhence it is said to appear so.*\n\nIf humans can follow these four principles,\nthen they will be serene and ever still—\npreserved.\nTo preserve yet be fixed is not the Dao/Way.\nThe saying \"appears as though it might be preserved\" (似或者不可定有之謂)\nrefers to this.\n\nI do not know whose child it is.\n**Wáng Yuànzǎi** (王元泽) says:\n*\"It is the embodiment of the Dao/Way as spoken of today.\nThough it has an origin, it is vast and without form—\nhence it is said: I do not know whose child it is.*\nThe phrase \"whose child\" (誰之子)\nasks from whom this Dao/Way originates.\n\n**The Form of the Emperor precedes the Dao/Way.**\n**御注** (Commentary):\n*\"Form (象) is the initial appearance of things.\nThe Emperor (帝) is the manifestation of the divine responding to things.*\nThings arise and then form appears;\nthe Emperor emerges and then wondrous things are manifest.\nThe Form of the Emperor (象帝),\nthough it marks the beginning of things,\nis preceded by the Dao/Way itself.\nThis is what **Zhuāngzǐ** (庄子) meant by\n**'the divine and the ghostly, the divine and the Emperor,**\n**generating heaven and earth.'**\nThe Form of the Emperor (象帝) portends the beginning of things,\nand the Emperor (帝) is the sovereign of all things.\nThe Form of the Emperor (象帝) is most profound,\nyet the Dao/Way surpasses it even further.\nThis chapter speaks of the Dao/Way using centrality (中) as its function,\nits essence empty yet not full,\nthe master of all existence,\npreceding the Form of the Emperor (象帝).\n\n**Chapter Five: Heaven and Earth**\nHeaven and Earth are not **virtuous** (仁),\ntreating all things as **straw dogs** (刍狗).\nThe Sage is not **virtuous** (仁),\ntreating the people as **straw dogs** (刍狗).\n\n**御注** (Commentary):\n*\"Kindness arises from harm,\nharm arises from kindness.\nIf kindness is taken as kindness,\nharm will inevitably follow.\nHeaven and Earth toward all things,\nthe Sage toward the people,\naid their natural tendencies,\nwithout a heart of love or benefit.\nKindness cannot be named with certainty.\"*\n\n**Straw dogs** (刍狗) are made by bundling straw,\nused in sacrifices to **Qí** (杞).\nWhen the ritual is appropriate, they are used;\nwhen it is over, they are discarded.\nAs for

as one.\nSuch virtue and conduct, so close to the Dao,\nthus it is said: *near.*\n\n**Residing in the good place,**\nMaster Ma Jùjì said:\nThe good resides in humility,\nwater flows downward—\nin the

what is precious.\nProbing is meant to avoid loss,\nyet sharpening leads only to greater loss.\nIf one wishes to avoid loss,\none should avoid sharpening entirely.\n*Probing* is skillful in measuring

*jīng*, but instead of saying *jīng*, it speaks of *\"one\"*—for guarding *\"one\"* prevents *jīng* from dispersing.\n\nMǎ Jùjì said: *Yíng* and *po* are distinct matters, differing only in embracing *\"one.\"*\nThe Dao generates *\"one,\"*\n*\"one\"* generates water,\nwater generates *jīng*—\nfor *jīng* is the substance of *\"one.\"*\nEmbrace *\"one,\"* and it unites with *jīng*;\nabandon

when speaking of *yíng-po* carrying, it means the spirit carries *po*.\nIf there is no spirit to carry it,\nthen it stagnates in dark yin,\nthe form scatters, the spirit departs,\nand it decays with all things below.\nBut if the spirit constantly carries *po* without being carried by it,\nthen the refined yang-spirit consumes the yin-*po*,\nand the body transforms into the Dao.\n\nThe matter lies in embracing *\"one\"* without leaving *\"one\"*—that is *jīng*.\nEmbrace *\"one,\"* and *jīng* unites with the spirit without separation,\nthen gather the spirit with *jīng*,\ndirect the form with

is void,\nits function arises.\nDoors and windows are carved for a room;\nwhen the room is void,\nits function arises.\n\nThe commentary states:\n*\"The marvelous function emerges from the utmost void,\ntransformation concealed in unburdened stillness—\nlike a mirror without image,\nyet reflecting all things when they appear.\nThe sage employs the heart,\never resolving in this principle.\nThus, having is used for utility,\nvoidness for function.*\n\n*Zhong Hui says: \"The three matters above illustrate that having and voidness mutually depend and neither can be neglected.\nThus, having is used for utility—\nutility lies in substance.\nVoidness is used for function—\nfunction lies in emptiness.\nTherefore, substance is external,\nutility relies on emptiness to achieve completion.\nEmptiness is internal,\nfunction borrows substance for its manifestation.\nBut utility and voidness depend on each other—\nnone can be discarded.\nVoidness depends on having for utility,\nhaving borrows voidness for function—\nthe two principles interrelate.\nChe Hui’s commentary: *‘To cultivate the self,\none must use substance to nourish emptiness,\nand emptiness to guide substance.\nSubstance and emptiness mutually support the heart,\npreventing it from leaning toward either—\nthus attaining the sage’s utility and function.’*\n\n*This chapter elucidates the interdependence of having and voidness,\nutility and function,\nusing three matters to reveal the Great Dao.\nThe wheels and hub form the carriage,\nclay shapes the vessel,\ndoors and windows define the room—\nthis is having,\nwhich people depend on for utility.\nThe hub’s void allows the wheels to turn,\nthe vessel’s void holds things,\nthe room’s void shelters people—\nthis is voidness,\nwhich people depend on for function.\nHaving brings real utility,\nvoidness must be employed for function.\nVoidness is subtle,\nfunction requires substance as its basis.\nHaving and voidness mutually depend,\njust as form and spirit rely on each other\nand cannot be neglected in isolation.\nSpirit dominates form,\nform houses spirit—\nwhen form and spirit harmonize,\nthey mutually generate and perfect each other.\nThe ignorant in this world:\nThose who refine spirit are obscured by voidness,\nthose who nourish form are drowned in having—\nboth lose their way.\nYet they fail to understand\nthat this chapter uses three objects as metaphors\nto illustrate how having and voidness generate each other.\nIf one seeks to learn the Dao,\nand practices according to this,\nthen form and spirit both attain perfection,\nand align with the true Dao.\"*\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Twelve: The Five Colors**\n\nThe five colors blind the eyes,\nthe five tones deaf the ears—\n*The commentary states: \"Even if one indulges the ears and eyes in sounds and colors,\nthough possessing the forms of ears and eyes,\nthey cannot see or hear themselves—\nwhat difference is there from blindness and deafness?\"*\n\nThe five flavors dull the palate—\n*Wang Yuanze says: \"Man is born in stillness,\nyet moves with things.\nThe ears and eyes are inherently subtle and refined,\nbut when sounds and colors confront them,\ntrue perception is lost to illusion and decay.\nThe palate’s relation to flavor is no different.\"*\n\nChasing and hunting drive the mind to madness—\n*Lu Jifu says: \"When nothing can perturb the mind,\nstillness brings sanctity.\nTo pursue externals is to lose all thought,\nand thus the mind descends into madness.\nHow much more so with reckless hunting and chasing?\nThe *Taikang* [of the *Yuejiu*] speaks of the Five Sons in blame,\nand Ai Gong’s love of hunting is censured by the poets.\nTo indulge in external excess—\nhunting without measure—\nis to stray from true nature.\nWhat is this but madness?\"*\n\nRare treasures obstruct one’s path—\n*The commentary states: \"To covet rare treasures\nis to reach for what endangers life itself.\nGreed for wealth and honor—\nhow can one’s path remain steadfast,\nwhen such things ensnare the heart?\nThus, Zhonghuai praised Tang [of Shang] with: ‘He did not accumulate wealth and gain.’\nAnd Confucius told Zigong: ‘You do not await orders yet engage in commerce.’\nWealth’s obstruction of the path is evident.\"*\n\nThe moon’s gem and night’s jade—\nmere tools for harm.\n*Mencius says: \"Jewels and jade\nare sure to bring misfortune to oneself.\"\nThus, the sage nourishes the belly, not the eyes—\n*Zhong Hui says: \"True qi is internally abundant,\nhence ‘nourishes the belly.’\nExternal desires are discarded,\nhence ‘does not indulge the eyes.’*\nThe five tones deaf the ears,\nso the sage nourishes the belly, not the eyes—\nall analogies follow this rule.\nTo nourish the belly is to preserve spirit and qi,\nto not indulge the eyes is to abandon the six passions\nand let the eyes not gaze wantonly.\nThus, discard that and take this—\n*River Above Master says: \"Discard the eyes’ wanton gazing,\ntake the belly’s nourishment of spirit.\nThe eyes govern external vision,\nthe belly governs internal containment.\nThe sage fills the belly,\nnot letting ears and eyes enslave the heart—\nthus discarding the external-seeing eyes,\nand taking the receptive belly.\nThough the sage purifies the six senses,\nhere he speaks only of ‘not indulging the eyes’—\nfor once the eyes are controlled,\nthe rest may be inferred.\"*\n\n*This chapter speaks of the harm of the five defilements,\nto forget things and preserve true nature—\nthe sage’s principle of discarding and taking is thus revealed.\"*\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Thirteen: Honor and Humiliation**\n\nHonor and humiliation are like sudden shock—\n*Shu Wang says: \"Honor becomes humiliation\nbecause it is like sudden shock.\"*\n*Ma Jiuji says: \"Honor is the root of humiliation,\nfor it binds the heart to gain and loss.\nIf one is seen as honored by others,\nthe greater the shock—\nhonor is but another form of humiliation.\"*\n\nGreat calamity is like being burdened by one’s own body—\n*The commentary states: \"Honor is lower, nobility is higher.\nTo dwell in honor and take it as glory\nis to invite humiliation.\nTo hold nobility yet see it as a burden\nis to court the greatest calamity.\nNobility means exalted rank.\nWhen the heart clings to nobility,\nits affliction is great indeed.\nLike a body that moves and strains itself—\nwhat is honor and humiliation?\nHonor is the lesser.\"*\n\n*The commentary states: \"To crave fame or covet wealth,\nknowing how to advance yet not retreat,\nknowing how to gain yet not lose—\nto receive honor from others\nis to embrace the path of inferiority.\nWhy does honor become humiliation?\nBecause receiving honor from others\nplaces the power of gain and loss in their hands.\nIf one’s heart is weighed down by such gains and losses,\nhow can it remain unclouded?\"*\n\nZiwen served three times and resigned three times,\nwithout joy or displeasure in his face—\n*Was there any humiliation for him?*\nTo gain is like shock,\nto lose is like shock—\nthis is called honor and humiliation as sudden shock.*",

      "translated_text": "**Shu Wang said:** The term \"sage-scholar\" (*shànwéi-sì*) denotes one who practices the Dao/Way. At its beginning, when one is still a sage-scholar, one has not yet departed from practicing the Dao/Way. At its end, when one becomes a sage, one is unified with the Dao/Way—so much so that the Dao/Way cannot be spoken of separately, for it is one with the Dao/Way. This is what is meant by \"subtle, profound, and penetrating, deep beyond recognition.\"\n\n**Ling Xian said:** The Dao/Way encompasses all names—this is what it means to be \"good.\" The practice of the Dao/Way reaches all things—this is what it means to be a \"sage-scholar.\" The previous chapter grasped antiquity to govern the present; this chapter governs the present while drawing upon antiquity. The previous chapter discussed the Dao/Way’s complete essence; this chapter speaks of the sage-scholar’s embodiment of the Dao/Way.\n\n\"Subtle\" (*wēi*) is the opposite of \"manifest\"; \"profound\" (*miào*) is the opposite of \"dangerous.\" \"Profound\" implies depths beyond measure; \"penetrating\" (*tōng*) implies endless transformation. The ancient sage-scholars who embodied the Dao/Way possessed this Way yet concealed it in mystery beyond measure—who could truly recognize them? Hence it is said, \"deep beyond recognition.\"\n\nOnly because they are beyond recognition does one forcibly attribute form to them. **Commentary:** The heavens’ height cannot be hastily measured; the earth’s depth cannot be hastily fathomed. When it says, \"round to cover, square to bear,\" it merely approximates their form. To forcibly attribute form to them—how could one truly grasp their ultimate essence? This refers to the following text: Only because the Dao/Way is vast and difficult to recognize does one forcibly attribute form to it.\n\nLike crossing a river in winter,\nor fearing one’s neighbors;\n**Master Lü Ji said:** The butcher Ding dissects an ox with ease, yet remains cautious—his gaze halts, his movements deliberate, the knife’s strokes barely perceptible. This is what is meant by \"like crossing a river in winter.\" Caution arises at the outset of action. Once the task is done, the pieces lie scattered like earth; he stands with his knife, gazes around, and sighs with satisfaction, then sheathes his blade. This is what is meant by \"like fearing one’s neighbors.\" \"Like\" implies careful restraint at the conclusion of action. Caution is rooted in preemptive stillness; \"like\" is rooted in lingering doubt after completion. \"Crossing\" refers to movement above the knees; \"river\" refers to the convergence of many streams. To cross a river is to encounter difficulty. In winter, the cold is extreme—yet to wade through a great river alone is to demonstrate that the ancient sage-scholars disliked action, only undertaking it when necessity demanded. They were always pressed into action, yet ever cautious in their approach. Hence it is said, \"like crossing a river in winter\"—once the crossing is made, there is no further hesitation. Yet when it comes to restraint, they are like the ancient sage-scholars, who were ever still and deep, never leaving their true nature. They always acted as if fearing their neighbors, gathering themselves without excess, repelling evil while preserving sincerity. No external things could probe them, for their hearts never strayed—hence it is said, \"like fearing one’s neighbors.\"\n\nLike a guest’s solemnity;\n**Master Wang Yuanze said:** They did not take action as their own responsibility, so their bearing was tranquil. **Zhuàn Wēi said:** A sage-scholar with the Dao/Way stands solemnly upright, his mind unscattered, as if a guest facing his host—how could he dare to be hasty? When the term \"container\" (*róng*) is used, it is like Dongguo Shunzi’s composed demeanor, which made others’ intentions fade. Hence, Tianzi Fang revered him as a teacher. When the term \"guest\" (*kè*) is used, it is like Li Contained-Light residing in a darkened chamber, as if facing his lord and father—hence, Sima Zimeng praised him so highly.\n\nLike ice about to melt;\n**Commentary:** Water congeals to become ice; ice melts to return to water—they are fundamentally one. Those who cling to one-sidedness are like water congealing. Those who align with the great harmony are like ice melting. The *Yì* says: \"Melt\" (*huàn*) is \"separation\"—separating from others without attachment, hence it is called \"melt.\" The *Sayings* say: \"Congealed yet dispersed is 'melt.'\" Water has no inherent ice; when it encounters cold, it congeals. Nature has no inherent obstruction; when it encounters things, it binds. A sage-scholar with the Dao/Way suddenly awakens to great insight—all affairs vanish, like spring ice melting away.\n\nLike the solid yet simple;\n**Commentary:** \"Solid\" (*dūn*) means the utmost thickness. Nature is fundamentally thick, like uncarved wood, before it disperses into vessels. This describes nature’s completeness. The *Classic* says: \"Return to the uncarved.\"\n\nLike the vast yet hollow;\n**Commentary:** \"Vast\" (*kuàng*) means the utmost breadth. Nature is originally boundless, like a valley’s emptiness, receptive yet responsive. This describes nature’s hollowness. The *Classic* says: \"The highest *virtue/power* is like a valley.\"\n\nLike the turbid yet undifferentiated;\n**Master Wang Bi said:** Concealing essence, hiding radiance—externally, they do not differ from things. They blend with dust and waves, hence it is said, \"like the turbid.\" **Master Yangzi said:** \"Unified, they are turbid; separated, they disperse.\" To be turbid is to blend with the world without separation, hence it is said, \"like the turbid.\" This is what Zhuangzi called \"aligning with things and flowing with their waves,\" differing from those who rigidly adhere to principles and reject worldly customs.\n\nThus, the sage-scholars who embody the Dao/Way: in winter, they dislike action, yet fear their neighbors and guard against later dangers; like guests who do not act as hosts; like ice that melts without obstruction; solid yet complete, vast yet hollow, turbid yet undistinguished by worldly norms—this is what is meant by \"deep beyond recognition,\" yet forcibly attributing form to them.\n\nWho could make the turbid clear?\nStillness gradually purifies.\n**Master Wang Yuanze said:** To clarify nature is like clarifying water. Overworking makes it murkier with motion; only by waiting in stillness does it gradually clear itself. A sage-scholar with the Dao/Way is never made turbid by things, for his stillness gradually purifies.\n\n**Master Cao Daochong said:** Would one follow the flow and forget to return? One merely clarifies stillness to gradually purify.\n\nWho could make the settled endure?\nMotion gradually arises.\n**Commentary:** A sage-scholar with the Dao/Way is both settled and in motion—when he acts, he does so with ease, yet remains rooted in his original nature. He is fixed yet able to respond to all things; he is empty yet fulfills all demands. Hence, stillness gradually purifies, and things cannot make him turbid. Motion gradually arises, yet things cannot unsettle him. The *Yì* says: \"Coming gradually\" (*lái xúxú*)—gradualness implies ease and self-adaptation. The ancient sage-scholars’ use of their hearts is not to stop with stillness as good, but to have stillness as their intention. Nor is it to generate motion as their achievement, but to have motion as their purpose. They follow their inherent nature, entrusting it to its own course, without urgency or haste.",

      "translated_text": "Thus it is said: When stillness gradually purifies, ten thousand things cannot perturb his heart—who could make it turbid? When motion gradually arises, ten thousand things cannot ensnare his thoughts—who could unsettle him? If one seeks stillness with the intent to stop, he will be bound by things, and thus will stop. How then could he respond to things without harm? Those who preserve the Dao/Way do not desire fullness.\n\nMaster Ma Juji said: Those who preserve without desiring fullness do so because the Dao/Way gathers in emptiness. Fullness, when it exists, is easily discerned. Only the unfull can—\n\nMaster Lü Jifu said: Though it is not called emptiness but always fullness, it is to prevent people from being burdened by emptiness. If one is burdened by emptiness, then it is not emptiness. Hence it is said: *Some* do not desire fullness, yet do not desire fullness. Thus they avoid exhaustion while remaining unspoiled.\n\nMaster Wang Yuanzai said: Those who attain the Dao/Way never become full, thus those who perfect the Dao/Way never become new. The Dao/Way’s function endures through ten thousand ages without exhaustion, for it has no exhaustion, no renewal, no completion, no ruin. Exhaustion arises from renewal, ruin from completion. Though a sage-scholar may perfect the Dao/Way, if he remains ever renewed, then he will never know exhaustion or ruin. This chapter speaks of the sage-scholar’s embodiment of the Dao/Way, profound beyond recognition, concluding with the admonition: *Do not desire fullness*—for emptiness is its essence. Emptiness is void and boundless, without a single thing—how could the world ever comprehend it?\n\nThe ancients who preserved this Dao/Way—like Great Yu who did not boast of his achievements, or Confucius who did not dwell on his sainthood—sought only emptiness. Laozi embodied emptiness itself, while Yanzi embodied the reality of emptiness. Here, it is clear that the Dao/Way gathers in emptiness.\n\n**Chapter Sixteen: The Chapter of Attaining Emptiness to Its Utmost**\n\nAttain emptiness to its utmost, guard stillness with sincerity.\n\n**Commentary:** Nothing is more precious than emptiness, nothing more virtuous than stillness. Emptiness and stillness are the root of all things. Emptiness suffices to receive all things; stillness suffices to respond to all motion. *Extreme* means gathering all things to reach a point; *sincere* means establishing conduct to reach a point. If one attains emptiness while seeking its utmost and guards stillness to reach sincerity, then though myriad forms may be diverse, my heart remains ever clear, and though myriad changes may differ, my heart remains ever tranquil—this is called Heaven’s joy. Only those who embody the Dao/Way can partake in this.\n\nMaster Zhong Hui said: *Attain* means *reach*. To attain emptiness is to reach the utmost of emptiness. To guard stillness is to reach the utmost of stillness. When emptiness is attained, like a valley receiving all things, without a speck of dust accumulating—this is called *extreme*. When stillness is guarded, like water responding to all motion, without a hair’s breadth of disturbance—this is called *sincere*. As all things arise together, I observe their return.\n\nMaster Yan Zun said: Heaven and Earth return and invert, thus enduring forever. Man returns to sleep, thus attaining clarity. Dragons and serpents return to their dens, thus their scales shine. Grasses and trees return to their roots, thus they remain verdant. When transformation returns, spirit and clarity attain their proper places, communicating with emptiness, the soul rests, the vital breath is tranquil, each finds its place of ease, the will is serene, the qi harmonious, the blood and vessels balanced—these are but temporary returns to stillness, yet still they preserve their spirit. How much more so for those who long endure in the utmost Dao/Way?\n\nI am the *command* given to all things. With emptiness and stillness attained to their utmost, I observe the arising of all things, commanding them without being transformed by them—thus it is said: *I observe their return*.\n\nAll things, teeming and diverse, each return to their root.\n\nMaster Wen Gong said: Things arise from non-being, return to non-being.\nMaster Wang Yuanzai said: From nature arises use, returning to nature’s root—though movement and stillness differ, their principle converges.\n\nReturning to the root is called stillness.\n\nMaster Su Ziyou said: If one cannot return to nature, even if he ceases motion and stills thought to seek stillness, it is not stillness. Only by returning to the root can one attain stillness.\n\nMan is born in stillness—this is Heaven’s nature. To return to nature is to be still. Stillness is called returning to command.\n\nMaster Lu Tian said: Speaking of the root, one knows there is an origin; speaking of command, one knows there is nature. Thus, returning to the root is called stillness, and returning to command is nature. Zhuangzi said: From the root and origin, before Heaven and Earth existed, from ancient times it has endured. *From the root* is returning to the root, called stillness. *From the origin* is returning to command, called stillness. *From ancient times* is returning to command, called constancy. *From the origin* is without dependence on an origin. *From the root* is without emergence from a root. *From ancient times* is without passage through time. Though returning to the root is called stillness, returning to command is called constancy, and returning to constancy is called constancy, their essence is one.\n\nThe order of speech—first root, then origin; first nature, then command—when speaking of the root, it is called returning; when speaking of command, it is called returning. Returning is not yet attainment; returning is attainment. The root is not yet attainment; command is attainment. The depth of returning is profound. Returning to command is called constancy.\n\nMaster Wang Yuanzai said: To be born from the Dao/Way is called command. To return to command is to revert to one’s origin, uniting with the Dao/Way, thus enduring through eternity without change. To know constancy is called clarity.\n\nMaster Shū Wang said: Constancy is the designation of that which has been unchanging since before beginning. To know its constancy is called clarity. Outside the Dao/Way, all is unconstancy. Though the Dao/Way is true and constant, formless and nameless, without self-awareness of its clarity, few escape being obscured by things.\n\nNot knowing constancy leads to reckless action and ruin.\n\n**Commentary:** The sage-scholar knows the constancy of the Dao/Way, thus his actions align with principle and always meet with good fortune. Those who do not know constancy drift with things, encountering misfortune at every turn, and cannot even preserve their own lives—thus they are ruined. Master Sun Deng said: Unable to return to the root and guard stillness, one’s life is cut short and constancy lost—this is the source of ruin.",

      "translated_text": "「Wang Yuanzé said: In the age of the Three Sovereigns (*Sān Huáng*), there was governance without action (*wúwéi*), allowing the people to each fulfill their nature (*gé suì*) without knowing it was so. How could one claim personal credit for this?\n\nMá Jùjì said: To know of a ruler (*jūn*) but not know of one’s ruler—this is the age of the Three Sovereigns.\n\nAs Zhuangzi said: The Taiyi (*Tàishì*) moved with leisurely ease in sleep, and awoke with serene clarity. One moment he took himself as horse, the next as ox.\n\nThe *Supreme Dao* (*Tàishàng*) refers to the nameless ruler (*jūn*) of the most ancient times (*Tàigǔ*). *Tài* means \"the utmost,\" *shàng* means \"the highest.\" Governance without action, the utmost and highest—none of the later ages could surpass this, hence it is called *Supreme Dao*.\n\nTo say \"the lower knows its existence\" (*xià zhī yǒuzhī*) means knowing of a ruler but not serving as a subject.\n\nThe next stage is to be cherished by the people and praised by them.\nMá Jùjì said: Benevolent love (*huì ài*), this is *virtue* (*rén*), hence the people are cherished. Rewards and punishments (*shǎng fá*), this is *righteousness* (*yì*), hence the ruler is praised. Yet even when cherished, the people grow distant; even when praised, the ruler’s power is undermined—this is because they still fall short of the *non-human* (*fēi rén*) ideal.\n\nThis is the age of the Two Emperors (*Èr Dì*).\n\nAs Zhuangzi said: The age of the Yu (*Yú*) did not reach that of the Taiyi.\n\nYáo’s benevolence was like Heaven’s, and those who approached him did so as if drawn by the sun.\nShùn reached the outskirts of Dengyu, and ten thousand families came to him—this was cherishing the people.\nKāng Qú praised Yáo, and the songs of praise (*ōng gē*) accompanied Shùn—this was praising the ruler.\n\nThe next stage is to be feared by the people and scorned by them.\nZhàn Wēi said: When *virtue* (*rén*) and *righteousness* (*yì*) are lost, legal punishments (*xíngfǎ*) are established, and the people fear them.\n\nMá Jùjì said: This is the age of the Three Kings (*Sān Wáng*).\nAs Zhuangzi said: When *virtue* (*rén*) and *righteousness* (*yì*) extended to the Three Kings, the world was greatly alarmed. Those who loved wisdom exhausted the people, and then the age of cudgels and saws (*zhuī záo yāng yán*) came.\n\nWhen wisdom reaches its extreme, great deceit (*dàwěi*) arises. The clever exploit those below them, and the foolish scorn those above, while punishments are insufficient to deter them—this is the age of the Five Hegemons (*Wǔ Bà*).\n\nAs Mencius said: The Five Hegemons relied on this.\n\nWang Yuanzé said: When *virtue/power* (*dé*) is lost and governance (*zhèng*) fails, the people scorn the ruler.\nTrustworthiness is insufficient, and distrust arises.\n\nThe *Imperial Commentary* (*Yù zhù*) states: When bonds are not reinforced with glue or lacquer, and restraints are not secured with ropes or cords, this is the utmost trustworthiness. The Shang people made oaths (*shì*) and the people began to betray them; the Zhou people made assemblies (*huì*), and the people began to doubt them—this is because trustworthiness was insufficient.\n\nWhen the *Supreme Dao* is known only as \"the lower knows its existence,\" then one should not know it as trustworthy. In the next stage, where the people fear and scorn the ruler, one knows of deceit. When Jiāo Huá’s cunning and Jì’s scheming arise, distrust begins.\n\nEmperor Xuānzōng of the Tang (*Táng Míng Huáng*) said: Those who fear and scorn the ruler are all due to the ruler’s insufficient trustworthiness, causing those below to have distrustful hearts.\n\nEven so, the ruler’s words are still honored.\nEmperor Xuānzōng said: When the ruler is cherished and praised, it is because the ruler has words of *virtue/power* (*dé jiào*), hence his words are honored and he is cherished and praised.\n\nMá Jùjì said: When words are not inherently honored yet are still honored, this is why it is said that though it falls short of the *Supreme Dao*, the ruler’s words still transform without explicit action. From this point onward, emperors have *canons and admonitions* (*diǎnmó*), and kings have *oaths and proclamations* (*shì gāo*).\n\nWhen achievements are complete and affairs are settled, the people say: \"This is our natural state.\"\nThe *Imperial Commentary* states: The ruler’s achievements are the *Dao/Way’s* (*shèngrén*) remaining work. To make the people content with their food, pleased with their clothing, secure in their dwellings, and joyful in their occupations—this is the *Dao/Way’s* remaining work sufficient to complete the ruler’s achievements. Yet the people say only: \"This is our natural state.\"\n\nThey say: \"What has the ruler’s power to do with us?\" This is called the governance of the *Supreme Dao*.\n\nEmperor Xuānzōng said: When achievements are complete yet not seized, and affairs are settled yet without further action, the people say: \"The ruler acts as if this were our natural state.\" What part does the ruler’s power play in it?\n\nThis chapter speaks of the distinct transformations of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, how the people’s customs swayed, the *Dao/Way* descending into *virtue/power* (*dé*), *virtue/power* declining into legal punishments (*xíng*), and punishments failing to control—inevitably leading to deceit and scorn. This is because trustworthiness was insufficient in the ruler, and the people had their doubts.\n\n**Chapter Eighteen: The Dao/Way is Abandoned**\nThe *Dao/Way* is abandoned, and *virtue* (*rén*) and *righteousness* (*yì*) arise.\n\nThe *Imperial Commentary* states: When the *Dao/Way* is lost, *virtue/power* (*dé*) follows; when *virtue/power* is lost, *virtue* (*rén*) follows; when *virtue* is lost, *righteousness* (*yì*) follows. *Virtue* establishes the people, *righteousness* establishes oneself—this is far from the *Dao/Way*.\n\nHan Yu did not grasp the true intent of the Sage’s *virtue/power* (*shèngrén dé yì*), instead claiming that *seven* (*qī*) and *righteousness* (*yì*) were definitive names, while *Dao/Way* and *virtue/power* (*dé*) were empty titles. Laozi’s *small virtue* (*xiǎo rén*) and *small righteousness* (*xiǎo yì*) were but narrow views.\n\nAs Zhuangzi said: These are the *people obscured by delusion* (*bìméng zhī mín*).\n\nThe *Supreme Dao* is the same as the *Dao/Way* of the most ancient times without action (*wúwéi*).\nWhen *virtue* and *righteousness* are not manifest, it is like the sun at its zenith while all stars lose their luster. *Abandoned* (*fèi*) is the same as *hidden* (*yǐn*).\n\nAfter the Three Sovereigns, people’s hearts were not pure and sincere. The *Supreme Dao* was hidden and unseen, while *seven* (*qī*) and *righteousness* (*yì*) were established and the *Dao/Way* declined. Like fish leaving the ocean for stagnant pools, the people then valued *benevolent care* (*rúmò zhī ēn*) more.\n\nHaving lost the *Dao/Way’s* natural path, the people then valued *virtue* and *righteousness*’s blessings more.\nAs Zhuangzi said: The *Dao/Way* is hidden in minor achievements.\n\nWhen wisdom arises, great deceit arises.\nEmperor Xuānzōng said: Those who employ wisdom seek to establish laws. When laws are established, deceit arises, and then great deceit emerges.\n\nWisdom (*huì*) has wisdom (*zhì*) as its essence, and wisdom (*zhì*) has wisdom (*huì*) as its application. Wisdom has great and small distinctions.\n\nAs Zhuangzi said: Abandoning minor wisdom (*xiǎo zhì*), great wisdom (*dà zhì*) becomes clear.\nAs Confucius said: Those who delight in minor cleverness (*xiǎo huì*) are said to have wisdom—this shows that wisdom has great and small distinctions.\n\nThe *Supreme Dao* says: These are the ones who take cudgels (*záo*) as wisdom and keen scrutiny (*chá*) as insight, crafting clever laws and decrees—this is minor wisdom.\n\nOnce wisdom arises, the people’s deceit and trickery flourish.\nIf one instead observes both near and far with tranquil ease, doing nothing yet benefiting all, following their natural state without adding or detracting—when the true and pure customs prevail, how could there ever be great deceit?\n\nWhen the six bonds (*liù qīn*) are not harmonious, filial piety (*xiào*) and tender care (*cí*) arise.\nZhōng Huì said: If all nine kin (*jiǔ zú*) are in accord, then love and respect are without limit. When the six bonds are not harmonious, then filial piety and tender care are emphasized.\n\nThe blind and the deaf were considered foolish, yet Shùn was called a great filial son.\nZēng Xǐ was stern, yet his brother Zǐshēn was praised for nurturing him.\nWhen the state is in chaos and confusion, loyal ministers arise.\n\nShū Wáng said: The *Dao/Way* is hidden in the formless, and names arise from insufficiency.»",

This is their insufficiency.\n\nThe four matters below are assigned to their natural attributes.\n\n**Seeing Simplicity, Embracing Purity.**\nShū Wáng said: It is not said \"guard simplicity\" but \"see simplicity\"—not \"return to purity\" but \"embrace purity\"—not \"have no selfishness\" but \"have little selfishness\"—not \"have no desires\" but \"have few desires.\" For only by seeing simplicity can one guard it; only by embracing purity can one return to it; only by having little selfishness can one achieve none; only by having few desires does one reach the point where there is nothing to be seen.\n\nSeeing simplicity reveals the true nature, untainted by external things.\nEmbracing purity preserves the whole essence, unharmed by external things.\n\n**Having Little Selfishness, Few Desires.**\nThe *Commentary* says: Self-seeking is selfishness, and nothing nourishes the heart better than its absence.\nFew desires and little selfishness—few desires clarify the distinction between inner and outer, true and false. Virtue is complete, and nature is restored.\n\nMa Jiuji said: \"Seeing simplicity\" belongs to the sage’s aversion.\nThat which is unmixed is called simplicity; to see simplicity is to see the *Dao/Way*, to see the *Dao/Way* is to take no action, and taking no action means there is no sage, no wisdom.\n\n\"Embracing purity\" belongs to virtue and righteousness.\nWhole material is called purity. To embrace purity is to embrace nature, to embrace nature is to be without artifice, and without artifice means there is no virtue, no righteousness.\n\n\"Little selfishness, few desires\" belong to cleverness and profit.\nSelf-possession is selfishness; having things is desire, and cleverness and profit arise from them.\nLittle selfishness and few desires mean cleverness and profit decline.\n\nThe *Zhuangzi·Tú Kuāng* chapter precisely clarifies the harm of sages, wisdom, righteousness, cleverness, and profit—this aligns with the intent of this passage.\n\nSelfishness is my body.\nLittle selfishness means not burdening oneself with cleverness and profit.\nDesire is the movement of nature.\nFew desires mean not disturbing one’s heart with cleverness and profit.\n\nLi Tian said: This chapter speaks of cutting off growth by uprooting the root, and suppressing overflow by blocking the source.\nIf lawmaking does not flourish, then true simplicity appears.\nIf ornamentation of righteousness is not applied, then purity is preserved.\nIf cleverness and profit are not practiced, then selfishness and desire are extinguished.\nThen Heaven’s harmony flows naturally, and daily life is effortless.\n\n---\n**Chapter Twenty: Abolish Learning, Have No Worry**\n\nAbolish learning, have no worry.\nThe *Commentary* says: Learning is to exhaust principle. When one is diligent in learning to exhaust principle, deliberating over good and evil, comparing order and chaos—how could there be no worry?\n\nLearning is to attain the *Dao/Way*; seeing the *Dao/Way* and then abandoning learning—reducing it, reducing it again, until one reaches non-action and yet nothing remains undone—then one follows the natural disposition of life, finding joy in whatever arises, and thus has no worry.",

Collection of *Dao De Jing* [\"Classic of the Way and Virtue\"].\n\n**Chapter 21: The Appearance of Virtue** [\"孔德之容\"]\n\nThe appearance of virtue follows only the Dao.\n\n**Commentary of the Master** [\"御注\"]:\nThe interplay of yin and yang is called the Dao; by this interplay, all things are born and thus possess virtue.\n\nThe Dao is ever nameless,\nhow can it be described in words?—\nthus its virtue is made divine.\n\nVirtue has form and substance,\nand all things share in it—\nthus the Dao is revealed.\n\n**Zhuangzi’s Annotation** [\"纂微曰\"]:\nThe Dao is ever nameless,\nonly virtue reveals it.\n\nVirtue without root,\nformed by following the Dao.\n\nSpeaking of those with great virtue,\ntheir appearance transcends all forms—\nhow can they be seen as crooked?\n\nOnly the appearance of one who follows the Dao\nbarely reveals their true state.\n\nIn their movements and demeanor, they observe propriety—\nthis is the peak of virtue.\n\nThose with peak virtue appear foolish,\nhow can they be seen as crooked?\nOnly those who follow the Dao\ncan be glimpsed as such.\n\nThus, when the eyes see, ears hear, nose smells, mouth speaks,\nhands hold, and feet walk—\nall are but the Dao.\n\nThus, the appearance of virtue follows only the Dao.\n\nThe Dao, as a thing,\nis but vague and indistinct.\n\n**Commentary of the Master** [\"御注\"]:\nThe Dao’s essence is absolute nothingness,\nyet its manifestations are wondrous—\nthis is why it is called a thing.\n\nYet all things are but the Dao.\nVague—where there is form to be likened,\nindistinct—where there are numbers to be traced.\nBut what is called \"having\" is but doubt of \"nothingness.\"\nThus it is said: The Dao, as a thing.\n\n**Gu Xuan’s Explanation** [\"顾欢曰\"]:\nTo speak of its definite existence,\nyet it has no color, no sound.\nTo say it is definite nothingness,\nyet it has trust and precision.\nSince its essence cannot be defined,\nit is called but vague and indistinct.\n\nThus, observing it as such\nis called following the Dao—\nthis is how one attains it.\n\n**Ma Jujie’s Explanation** [\"马巨济曰\"]:\nWhen nothingness appears as having—\nthis is vague.\nWhen having appears as nothingness—\nthis is indistinct.\nThis is the Dao’s thing.\n\nThe Dao, in its vague and indistinct nature,\nreturns to nothingness—\nthis is what cannot be contained.\n\n**Wang Yuanzhe’s Explanation** [\"王元泽曰\"]:\nThe Dao encompasses yin and yang.\nThe subtleties of yin and yang,\nwhen they appear as neither having nor nothingness,\nare called vague and indistinct.\n\nIndistinct yet vague—\nwithin it, forms arise.\nVague yet indistinct—\nwithin it, things manifest.\n\n**Commentary of the Master** [\"御注\"]:\nWhat is seen is called form,\nwhat is shaped is called thing.\nWithin vague and indistinct,\nforms and things are complete—\nlike vast space transforming into thunder and wind,\nlike great mass becoming water and fire,\nto bring forth change,\nto move the numinous and divine—\nthis is the Dao’s wondrous work.\n\nFaint and dark—\nwithin it, essence resides.\n\n**Commentary of the Master** [\"御注\"]:\nFaint—the extreme of seclusion,\ndark—the concealment of illumination.\nWithin faint and dark,\nthe origin of supreme yin,\nwhere Heaven’s One manifests—\nessence truly arises.\n\nIts essence is exceedingly true,\nwithin it, trust resides.\n\n**Wang Yuanzhe’s Explanation** [\"王元泽曰\"]:\nEssence—the beginning of form’s birth.\nEssence is never false,\nyet it is further called \"exceedingly true\"—\nbecause things may lose their proper order,\nand essence, likened to human artifice, may err.\n\nThe essence within faint and dark,\ngives rise to all things,\nand the things born,\neach follow their natural form and measure,\ntheir laws and patterns—\nonce a standard is set,\nthe future can be known without deviation,\nthis is called trust.\n\n**Zhuangzi’s Words** [\"庄子曰\"]:\nBefore form, there is division.\nEssence—the peak of Heaven’s virtue.\nTrue, then it is not false;\ntrustworthy, then it does not err.\nFrom ancient times to today,\nits name does not fade.\n\n**He Shang Gong’s Words** [\"河上公曰\"]:\n*Self*—to follow.\nFrom ancient times to today,\nthe Dao remains unceasing.\n\n**Wang Yuanzhe’s Explanation** [\"王元泽曰\"]:\nThe Dao is constant in name,\nnever changing or transforming.\n\n**Ma Jujie’s Explanation** [\"马巨济曰\"]:\nAs all things transform and change,\ntheir names shift accordingly.\nWhat was once called \"right\"\nis now called \"wrong.\"\nYet what remains steadfast through ages past and present—\nthe Dao alone.\n\nThus, it oversees all beginnings.\n\n**Wang Bi’s Explanation** [\"王弼曰\"]:\nAll beginnings—\nthe origins of things.\nTo oversee with the nameless\nthe origins of all things—\nthis is to oversee.\n\nTo oversee—\nas when one examines many texts.\nHow do I know all beginnings are thus?\nBy this.\n\n**Su Shi’s Explanation** [\"苏子由曰\"]:\nThe Sage knows how all things are one\nthrough essence.\n*Pattern*—law.\n*One*—the source of all multiplicity.\nThe Sage attains the world with the few,\nyet is troubled by the many.\nThe Sage embraces *One* without departing from essence,\nthe world abandons multiplicity and returns to *One*—\nthus the Sage becomes the world’s law and pattern.\n\nNot self-revealing, hence clear;\n**Commentary of the Master** [\"御注\"]:\nNot obscured by one’s own limited perspective,\nthen nothing remains unseen—\nhence clear.\n\nYu Shun’s four eyes widened his vision,\nthis can be called not self-revealing.\nTo perceive all things,\nto discern human relations—\nthis is not clear?\n\nCheng Wang’s open and unconstrained mind,\nunblocked within himself—\nthis can be called not self-revealing.\nTo illuminate all and be illuminated in return,\nthis is not clear?\n\nNot self-affirming, hence manifest;\n**Commentary of the Master** [\"御注\"]:\nNot partial to one’s own rightness,\nyet following only what is right—\nthen great is their achievement,\nbright their fame,\nand the world submits—\nhence manifest.\n\n**Lu Jifu’s Explanation** [\"吕吉甫曰\"]:\nTo follow what the world affirms as right,\nyet I do not self-affirm—\nthen what is right cannot be exhausted.\nThus it is said: Not self-affirming, hence manifest.\n\nNot self-praising, hence meritorious;\n**Commentary of the Master** [\"御注\"]:\n*The Book of Documents* [\"《书》\"] says: \"You alone do not praise yourself,\nthen the world cannot contend with you for merit.\"\n\n**Shu Wang’s Explanation** [\"舒王曰\"]:\nNot self-praising, then goodness is not lost—\nhence meritorious.\n\nNot self-boasting, hence enduring;\n**Commentary of the Master** [\"御注\"]:\n*The Book of Documents* [\"《书》\"] says: \"You alone do not boast,\nthen the world cannot contend with you for ability.\"\n\n**Lu Jifu’s Explanation** [\"吕吉甫曰\"]:\nTo entrust all things with ability,\nyet I do not self-boast—\nhence enduring.\n\nThus, only by not contending,\nthe world cannot contend with them.\n**Commentary of the Master** [\"御注\"]:\nOthers take the lead,\nI alone remain behind—\nthis is to bear the world’s filth.",

      "translated_text": "Thus the Dao is Great, the Heaven is Great, the Earth is Great, and the King is also Great.\n\n*Commentary*: The Dao encompasses and sustains Heaven and Earth. Heaven covers all without limit, Earth bears all without measure, and the King stands between them, harmonizing with Heaven and Earth. Thus, the King is also Great.\n\nThe Dao encompasses all things. It wraps Heaven and Earth, vast beyond bounds, hence it is said that the Dao is Great. Heaven and Earth are the Great in form. Heaven is boundlessly broad, beyond measure, and Earth is boundlessly vast, beyond calculation. Hence, it is said that Heaven is Great and Earth is Great.\n\nUnder all Heaven, there is nothing not the King’s soil. At the edges of all lands, there is nothing not the King’s subjects. The King’s virtue aligns with Heaven and Earth, his Dao flows through the Three Realms [\"三才\"], and none surpasses the Emperor and King in greatness. Thus, the King is also Great.\n\nWithin the realm [\"域\"], there are four Great things, and the King occupies one of them.\n\n*Commentary*: From the Dao descending, there arises form and substance, hence it is said that within the realm, stillness is the Dao’s, while action is the Sage’s. The King can offer tribute to the Three Realms and harmonize them, making human conduct supreme. Thus, he shares substance with the Dao and function with Heaven and Earth, and is likewise called Great. The King is the culmination of human conduct.\n\nThe Dao was never confined by boundaries, yet this passage speaks of the realm [\"域\"], meaning though it is confined, it wraps all things without limit.\n\nHumans model themselves after Earth, Earth models itself after Heaven, Heaven models itself after the Dao, and the Dao models itself after Nature [\"自然\"].\n\nShu Wang says: Humans model themselves after Earth—this is the King’s greatness. Earth models itself after Heaven—this is Earth’s greatness. Heaven models itself after the Dao—this is Heaven’s greatness. The Dao models itself after Nature—this is the Dao’s greatness. For Nature [\"自然\"] is as if it transcends causes and conditions [\"因缘\"]. Neither cause nor condition, nor yet Nature. Yet the Dao’s Nature, when viewed by the self-cultivator [\"自学者\"], is called *Mysterious* [\"妙\"]. When observed by Laozi, it still retains traces of causes and conditions. Yet Laozi does not fail to grasp the Dao’s profound essence, nor does he exhaust the law within the law. Hence it is said: the Dao models itself after Nature.\n\nHumans speak of the King. Humans model themselves after Earth’s steadfast stillness, thus without action [\"无为\"], all under Heaven is accomplished. Earth models itself after Heaven’s non-action, thus without growth [\"不长\"], all things are nourished. Heaven models itself after the Dao’s Nature, thus without giving birth [\"不产\"], all things transform. The Dao is self-originating, self-rooted; before Heaven and Earth existed, it endured from antiquity, having nothing to model itself after. That which has no model is simply Nature itself. Hence it is said: the Dao models itself after Nature.\n\nThis chapter speaks of the *Mixed and Complete* Dao [\"混成之道\"], which precedes Heaven and Earth in birth. Its substance is lofty and independent, its function flows through the six voids [\"六虚\"], beyond description. Though the name *Great* is applied, it is still said.\n\nThough the Two Principles [\"二仪\"] are lofty and profound, and the King’s authority is supreme, all defer to the Dao.\n\nThe Dao is self-originating, self-rooted, without causes or conditions, yet naturally so.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Six: The Heavy as the Root of the Light**\n\nThe heavy is the root of the light,\nthe still is the master of the restless.\n\nRiver Upper Master [\"河上公\"] says: If the sovereign does not hold weight [\"重\"], he will not be revered. If governing the body does not hold weight, the spirit will be lost. Grass and trees, leaves and flowers are light, hence they wither and fall. The root is heavy, hence it endures long.\n\nIf the sovereign is not still, his authority will be lost; if governing the body is not still, the body will be in peril. The dragon is still, hence it can transform and vary. The tiger is restless, hence it is cut down prematurely.\n\nLü Jifu [\"吕吉甫\"] says: The light is first to respond [\"先感\"], the heavy is last to react [\"后应\"]. That which reacts is born from what responds, hence the heavy is the root of the light.\n\nThe still governs things [\"役物\"], the restless is governed by things [\"役於物\"]. The restless is often governed by the still, hence the still is the master of the restless.\n\nLiu Zhongping [\"刘仲平\"] says: The light arises from the heavy, hence the heavy is the root of the light. The restless arises from stillness, hence the still is the master of the restless.\n\nThus the virtuous person [\"君子\"] walks all day without straying from his burden [\"辎重\"]. Though he has splendid views [\"荣观\"], his repose [\"燕处\"] is serene and detached.\n\n*Commentary*: Splendid views are in things [\"物\"], repose is in the self [\"身\"]. Only when the self is at ease can things bring joy. Walking is swift with lightness, yet one cannot walk without a burden. Observing is glorious with restlessness, yet one cannot observe without repose. Having the burden of the burdened, yet not hindered in the Dao, then one can walk. Having the repose of repose, yet serene and self-sufficient, then one can observe. Hence it is said: the heavy is the root of the light, the still is the master of the restless.\n\nHow can the ruler of ten thousand chariots [\"万乘之主\"] bear a light body [\"身轻\"] while weighing the world [\"天下\"]?\n\nLü Jifu [\"吕吉甫\"] says: Even the virtuous person’s daily walk and his splendid views are thus, how much more the ruler of ten thousand chariots, bearing heavy burdens [\"任重\"] and traveling distant roads [\"道远\"], surveying all under Heaven [\"观天下\"]—can he not be still and heavy?\n\nForced to move, then he reacts [\"动\"].\nSensate and then he responds [\"感\"].\nUnable to help himself, then he rises [\"起\"]—\nthis is the heavy.\n\nWithout action [\"无为\"], then he is still [\"静\"].\nIf his movement is always at the point of compulsion [\"得已\"], and he cannot be without action, then he bears a light body while weighing the world, yet is not heavy. Not heavy, then he is restless, and not still.\n\nLu Tian [\"陆佃\"] says: All under Heaven [\"天下\"] is the sovereign’s burden and also his repose—what cannot be separated.\n\nThus it is said: How can the ruler of ten thousand chariots bear a light body while weighing the world? Lightness will lose his subjects [\"臣\"], restlessness will lose his authority [\"君\"].\n\n*Commentary*: Not heavy, then he lacks authority [\"威\"], hence he loses his subjects. If he does not lead yet seeks harmony [\"不唱而和\"], he violates proper order [\"犯分\"], hence he loses his authority.\n\nLu Tian [\"陆佃\"] says: The heavy is the sovereign’s virtue [\"德\"], the still is the subject’s conduct [\"道\"].\n\nSong Lingxian [\"松灵仙\"] says: If the heart is in turmoil [\"动乱\"], it will harm the *Mysterious Spirit* [\"妙神\"]. The spirit is the sovereign [\"神即君也\"]. This chapter warns the sovereign to take stillness and weight as his foundation.\n\nAll under Heaven [\"天下\"] is the sovereign’s stillness and weight. How can it be lightened with one’s own body?\n\nThose who cultivate the True [\"修真之士\"] also take stillness and weight as their foundation: they weigh their body yet do not burden it with things [\"不以物累形\"], they still their heart yet do not let things disturb their spirit [\"不以物乱神\"]. Body intact, spirit settled—this is the Dao’s completeness [\"全\"].\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Seven: The Good Way**\n\nThe good way leaves no tracks [\"无辙迹\"].\n\nShu Wang [\"舒王\"] says: The good way does not hasten [\"不疾\"], yet is swift [\"速\"]. The bad way does not move [\"不行\"], yet arrives [\"至\"]. Thus it is said.",

A carriage moves and leaves tracks, a lone traveler leaves footprints—so action indeed cannot lack traces. Yet the practitioner of the good way seeks it within oneself without stepping beyond one’s courtyard; their action emerges from non-action, hence there are no tracks—this is what is meant by \"non-action yet arrival.\"\n\nThe good speech has no flaws or censure;\n\nDu Guangting says: The practitioner of good speech attains the meaning and forgets the words.\nThus, there is no disease of blemishes or offense of reproach.\n\nLü Jifu says: The wise do not speak, and those who speak lack wisdom.\nSo speech indeed cannot lack flaws or censure.\nTo know why one speaks, speech arises from non-speech—hence it is said: The good speech has no flaws or censure.\n\nThe good plan requires no calculations or reckoning;\nThe Imperial Commentary says: To understand unity, all affairs are completed—how much more so for what is not mere numbers! Thus, without using calculations or reckoning, one adapts to myriad changes as though counting one and two.\n\nThe good closure needs no bolts or bars yet cannot be opened;\nShu Wang says: The practitioner of good closure allows no thing to enter through its gate, hence there are no bolts or bars yet it cannot be opened.\nWen Gong says: A well-governed state does not rely on the natural barriers of mountains and rivers.\nThe nine orifices are the gates of spirit and vitality.\nThe practitioner of good closure guards their spirit internally, preventing it from dissipating outward.\nThough internally there may be no bolts or bars, how could it be opened?\n\nThe good binding needs no cords or constraints yet cannot be undone;\nGu Xuan says: To bind with the Dao, though lacking cords, it is self-secured. To bind with things, though having constraints, it is not firm.\nThus, to constrain others with coercive force, even three armies may desert.\nTo bind with the Dao, even a single man’s resolve is hard to seize.\nWen Gong says: To confine the people, one does not rely on the boundaries of sealed borders.\nDu Guangting says: The practitioner of good conduct forgets all concerns, with no second thought; their stillness aligns with the Dao, merging with the True.\nNot even myriad green things can encroach, nor all temptations seduce—this is called good binding, how could it be undone?\n\nTherefore, the Sage always practices good rescue, hence there are none abandoned.\nCai Zihuang says: To benefit others is good.\nHong Ji says: To rescue all beings in the ten directions, one must first establish their own land.\nThe flow of good is ever enveloped in mystery, its blessings evenly spread, nurturing all life, returning to the Dao’s source.\nThe vulgar and deceitful, Emperor Shun taught them yet did not abandon.\nThe empty and foolish, Confucius exhausted all explanations.\nAlways practicing good rescue, there are none abandoned.\n\nThe Imperial Commentary says: Good is the Dao’s continuation in the unseen.\nThe Dao itself cannot be named as good.\nWhen good is named and established, the Dao departs and good becomes the world.\nThe Sage embodies the Dao to benefit All-Under-Heaven, hence these five goods.\nYet, in the case of people and things, none are abandoned.\n\nHowever, the Sage’s way of loving people and benefiting things, letting them fulfill their nature while humans find joy in theirs, is not arbitrary.\nTo invert unity is to lose the Dao; to cling to the constant yet neglect the Dao is to abandon its path.\nAll-Under-Heaven has lost its tranquil, still, and ever-present nature, daily sinking into the realm of sorrow and peril—who but the Sage could rescue them?\n\nThe *New Sayings* state: All things have their natural principles; indeed, there are those who defy and reverse them.\nAll things have their inherent nature; indeed, there are those who violate and shackle it.\nAll things have their proper fate; indeed, there are those who oppose and sever it.\nThe Sage, moved with compassion, thus employs their treasured virtue to rescue them.\nTo those who defy principle, they open what is blocked and make clear.\nTo those who violate nature, they remove what is harmful and bring ease.\nTo those who oppose fate, they restore what is severed and revive it.\nThis is called \"inheriting clarity.\"\n\nThe Imperial Commentary says: To inherit is to reveal without display.\nTo inherit clarity is to shine without blinding.\n\nLü Jifu says: These five aspects—principle, nature, fate, and their shared essence—are what the Sage understands through constant wisdom, rescuing at the moment of shared truth.\nThough they act, speak, plan, close, or bind, none know how it is done—\ninherited clarity cannot be seen directly.\nHence it is said: This is called inheriting clarity.\n\nTherefore, the good person is the teacher of the not-good.\nThe not-good person is the resource of the good.\nThe Imperial Commentary says: Resource refers to what is useful; there are not-good people.\nOnly then does one know good as beneficial.\n\nShu Wang says: The good person teaches the not-good.\nHence, the good person is the teacher of the not-good.\nWithout the not-good, one would not know good as good.\nHence, the not-good person is the resource of the good.\nTo not honor one’s teacher is to not cherish one’s resource.\n\nSu Ziyou says: The Sage has no personal intent in teaching, hence does not cherish their resource.\nAll-Under-Heaven has no intent in learning, hence does not honor their teacher.\nThe Sage does not merely forget All-Under-Heaven; they also make All-Under-Heaven forget them.\n\nLiezi, taught by Laozi, befriended Boyi, and attained the Way of the Immortal Wind.\nAfter nine years, he also did not recognize his master as his teacher nor his friend as his friend—\nhis inner and outer progress was complete.\nThis is called not honoring one’s teacher.\nConfucius, upon meeting Lord Shang of Yin, then declined further association and dismissed his disciples—\nthis is called not cherishing one’s resource.\nThough knowing the great confusion, it is called the ultimate mystery.\n\nThe Imperial Commentary says: The Dao’s ultimate mystery lies in not perceiving the myriad goods,\nhaving no need for cleverness or calculation.\nThe Seven Sages were all in confusion, yet none questioned their path—\nthis meaning converges here.\n\nLi Zhan says: This chapter speaks of the Sage’s subtle and hidden use of virtue,\nwhose manifestations are imperceptible.\nThough it is said they always practice good,\nthe mystery lies in their simultaneous forgetting—\nthus they can teach and speak.\nWhat they do not explain through intricate reasoning\nhas no means of reckoning or tracing.\nThis is the good teacher and resource as a path for gradual cultivation,\ncutting off all attachment to enter the gate of sudden enlightenment,\naligning with inherited clarity to rescue all things.»",

      "translated_text": "**The Daoist Canon: *Taking the Good* (Volume 5) – Collected Commentaries of Song Resident Scholar Li Lin**\n\n**Chapter 28: Knowing the Heroic, Holding the Feminine**\n\nKnow its heroic, hold its feminine.\n\nDu Guangting says: In the Upper Clarity Dao, there is the method of the One Feminine, and also the Three Chases and Five Feminines—all softening the will, harmonizing the spirit, to attain longevity.\n\nIt becomes the valley of all under Heaven.\n\nWang Yuanzhe says: A valley receives and channels all flowing waters. To hold the feminine is to remain in emptiness and stillness, receiving all things without obstruction, hence it is the valley of all under Heaven.\n\nThe heroic moves, the feminine is still. The Perfect One knows its movement yet does not follow it, always holding stillness without abandoning the True. Thus, it is said to be the valley below.\n\nThe Dao comes and returns to me like water flowing into a deep valley, hence it is the valley of all under Heaven.\n\nIt becomes the valley of all under Heaven, its constant virtue never departing.\n\nLü Jifu says: A valley receives from the ravine and delivers to the rivers and seas—receiving without resistance, delivering without accumulation. It is the thing that flows through without obstruction.\n\nTo flow through is to have constant virtue never departing.\n\nWang Yuanzhe says: Constant virtue is fixed and unchanging within me. \"Not departing\" means it remains within its nature, internal and not external.\n\nIt returns to the infant.\n\nWang Yuanzhe says: The infant holds harmony and unity, with no desires or thoughts yet formed. Its nature is pure and undispersed, its virtue profound—thus it aligns with the original.\n\nSuch is worthy of the name Great.\n\nMencius said: The Great Person does not lose the heart of the infant.\n\nThe feminine governs gentleness and stillness.\n\nThe infant’s bones are weak, its sinews soft; its *qi* is not violent, its desires and thoughts not yet formed. Its virtue is unchanging—this is the depth of contained virtue, like the infant’s purity.\n\nKnow its white, hold its black.\n\nWang Yuanzhe says: Black is the color of the North, where stillness cannot be fully described. The Sage establishes all things; without holding black, there is no foundation. This is verified by the emergence of spring and summer from the dark winter.\n\nIt becomes the model of all under Heaven.\n\nLü Jifu says: White, in color, is receptive; in things, it is brightness; in action, it is metal; in numbers, it is four. Black, in color, is untainted; in things, it is obscurity; in action, it is water; in numbers, it is one.\n\nTo know white and hold black is to receive no taint from all things. Like obscurity, like water, it ultimately embraces the One. Embracing the One, it can bend and yield, sink and be depleted—thus it can be the model of all under Heaven.\n\nWhite is clarity, untouched by things. Black is silent stillness, in numbers the One.\n\nThe Perfect One knows its clarity yet holds silent stillness in the One. All under Heaven follows and emulates this, hence it is the model of all under Heaven.\n\nIt becomes the model of all under Heaven, its constant virtue never erring.\n\nLü Jifu says: To be the model of all under Heaven is to be One in all things, thus its constant virtue never errs.\n\n\"Not departing\" means it does not stray from its original place, yet this does not guarantee it will not err. To not err is to not deviate.\n\nIt returns to the Boundless.\n\nLü Jifu says: The infant is a thing that focuses *qi* and softens, preserving its unity without loss.\n\nTo return to the Boundless, the infant is insufficient to describe it.\n\nLuóshī says: *Tè* means to fail or lose. If one abandons wisdom and holds foolishness, acts in accord with spontaneity, and virtue aligns with action, becoming the model for all things—manifesting in action yet returning to the Dao—since the Dao is inexhaustible, it attains the Boundless.\n\nOne is the Boundless of wisdom, two is the Boundless of life.\n\nKnow its glory, hold its humiliation.\n\nDu Guangting says: Glory is exalted honor. Humiliation is lowly shame. A ruler possesses the eight extremes, dominating the nine boundaries—this is exalted honor. To call oneself \"lonely,\" \"widowed,\" or \"not-grain\" is lowly shame.\n\nIt becomes the valley of all under Heaven.\n\nShū Wáng says: To know glory and hold humiliation is to guard with humility and respond well, hence it is the valley of all under Heaven.\n\nIt becomes the valley of all under Heaven, its constant virtue now complete.\n\nLiu Zhongping says: A valley can be empty and responsive, contain and receive—thus its constant virtue is complete.\n\nIt returns to the Uncarved.\n\nSu Shiru says: Not knowing yet not acting is inferior to knowing yet not acting to the utmost.\n\nTo know the heroic and hold the feminine is to know nature. To know white and hold black is to see nature. To know glory and hold humiliation is to restore nature.\n\nWhen all delusions are exhausted, dwelling in humiliation without regret, vast like the emptiness of a valley—things come and it responds—virtue is complete here, pure nature without mixture.\n\nThus it is said: It returns to the Uncarved.\n\nSōnglíng Xiān says: *Zú* means sufficiency. *Fù* is return. *Pǔ* is the true origin.\n\nAt first, knowing the heroic ends with holding humiliation.\n\nThe three practices of holding humiliation are complete as the essence of the Dao. Like an empty valley with nothing to contain, this is how constant virtue attains supreme virtue, thus it returns to true emptiness, merging with the Dao. Hence it is said: It returns to the Uncarved.\n\nGrasses and trees flourish as glory, wither as humiliation. What makes humans glory or humiliation is no different.\n\nThe Perfect One knows glory yet does not dwell in it, discards ornamentation and returns to the root, always holding humiliation—dwelling in what others despise, unburdened, for it is empty. Hence it is the valley of all under Heaven.\n\nThe valley is empty and receives, responds yet does not hoard. Virtue reaches this peak—exhausted, beyond addition.\n\nThus it is said: Its constant virtue is complete.\n\nThe Uncarved is the complete body of the Dao. To return to the Uncarved is to fully embody the Dao.\n\nThe titles \"lonely,\" \"widowed,\" \"not-grain\" are used by kings and dukes, hence embracing the Uncarved, all under Heaven returns. To return to the Uncarved is beyond the Boundless—this is the nameless Uncarved.",

world.\n\n**Zhuān Wēi** said:\nThe cruel and violent who delight in killing\ncannot be allowed to achieve their desires in the world.\nIf they do, they defy Heaven’s virtue,\nunleashing slaughter at will,\ntreating the people as grass and chaff—\nhow could Heaven aid them?\nIf Heaven does not aid them,\nhow could they achieve their desires?\n\nThose who take pleasure in killing\nmust not be allowed to achieve their desires in the world.\nAs rulers, one must not arbitrarily execute.\nThis is what Mencius meant by:\n*\"Only those who do not delight in killing can unite the people.\"*\n\nAuspicious matters honor the left,\ninauspicious matters honor the right.\n\n**Chéng Xuányīng** said:\nAuspicious refers to morning rites,\ninauspicious refers to funeral rites.\n\n**Hé

position,\nfor he alone commands killing.\nThis is treated as funeral rites.\n\nThe momentum of war\nplaces the right in the superior position—\nthus it is treated as funeral rites.\nWhen many are slain,\none mourns them with tears.\n\n**Cáo Dàochōng** said:\nAll under Heaven are the ruler’s people—\nby their obedience or defiance,\nsome are killed in great numbers—\nthus one weeps and grieves for them.\n\n**Yánggù** said:\nIt is made clear that this is not a delight.\n\nWhen victorious in battle,\none treats it as funeral rites.\n\n**御注:**\nThe *Yì* calls the army a poison to the world—\nthough victorious in battle,\nthere will always be those harmed by its poison,\nthus the superior position is given to mourning,\nas if the victor were in funeral rites.\n\n**Hé Shànggōng** said:\nIn ancient times, when victorious in battle,\nthe general occupied the position of the funeral master,\nwearing plain mourning garments and weeping.\n\nThe virtuous honor virtue and despise arms,\nusing them only when forced to punish inauspiciousness—\ntheir hearts grieve as if in mourning.\n\n**Lǚ Jífǔ** said:\nTo treat victory as funeral rites\nmakes it clear that arms are inauspicious\nand not delightful.\nTo mourn with tears\nmakes it clear that one does not delight in killing.\n\n**Lǐ Tián** said:\nThis chapter states that the virtuous should take morality as their village instrument,\nnot war and conquest as their achievements.\nIf one delights in arms and strength,\nthen killing will follow.\nIf not for funeral rites,\nthere would be no way to treat it.\n\n---\n**Chapter Thirty-Two: The Dao Ever Nameless**\n\nThe Dao ever nameless.\n\n**Wang Bì** said:\nThe Dao has no form,\nthus it cannot be named.\nTo be ever nameless is its constant—\nthus it is said: the Dao ever nameless.\n\n**Liú Zhòngpíng** said:\n\"Constant\" refers to an eternal, unchanging designation.\nThe height of Heaven,\nthe depth of Earth,\nthe brilliance of the sun and

rule all things with the true sovereign,\nand who would there be among all things\nthat obtained the true sovereign yet did not submit?\n\nThe Dao/Way is the master of all things.\nIf kings and lords uphold it,\nthen without resorting to coercive force or incentives of reward,\nthings would not know how, yet they would willingly submit.\n\nThe heavens and earth unite,\nand sweet dew descends.\nNo

dew is the harmonious *qi* of the heavens and earth.\n*The Classic of Changes* says:\nThe virtue/power of emperors and kings,\nascends to the **Tàiqīng** (Supreme Clarity),\ndescends to the **Tàiníng** (Supreme Tranquility),\nand permeates all living beings—\nthen sweet dew descends.\n\n**Wang Yuanzé** said:\nIf one guards the nameless essence of the Dao/Way\nas the foundation of governance,\nthen the rising and falling of Yin and Yang\nwill proceed according to their natural order,\nand the harmonious *qi* will respond accordingly.\n\nSweet dew is the product of Yin and

Dao/Way,\nand all things submit to it—\nthat is all there is to it.\nWho can truly see its form?\n\nThus, no one commands it,\nyet all is balanced.\n\n**Sū Zǐyóu** said:\nThe undifferentiated *qi*

Zǐhuǎng** said:\nIf one knows where to stop,\nreturning from the end of named things\nto the root of the nameless,\nthen one neither dies nor lives—\nthis is the way of avoiding peril.\n\nNamed things are the scattered manifestations of the Dao/Way.\nWhen names were first established,\none should immediately know where to stop,\nand return to the nameless essence of the Dao/Way—\nthen one will not

      "translated_text": "「Zhōng Huì said: To subdue the rigid and strong, one must appear soft and yielding—first expanding, then contracting—then victory and defeat become apparent. The Tang Emperor Xuānzōng said: Compliance and submission enable the exercise of authority; when authority is wielded, one can govern all things. Thus, it is known that the soft and yielding must prevail over the rigid and strong.\n\nTaking examples from oneself: Teeth, though firm, wear out first, while the tongue, though soft, endures. Taking examples from nature: Mountains, though high, lose their strength, while marshes, though low, grow fertile. Fish cannot be removed from the depths, nor can a state’s most potent tools be revealed to others.\n\n*御注*: The depths are where fish conceal their bodies. Potent tools are what a state uses to subdue others. A fish as large as a boat, if stranded and loses its water, even ants can torment it—thus it cannot be removed from the depths. When a ruler is seen granting rewards, ministers exploit his authority. When a ruler is seen imposing punishments, ministers exploit his power. Rewards and punishments are instruments of governance and must not be displayed—how much more so the principles of governance itself?\n\nThe Sage wields potent tools yet does not reveal them—not because he relies on brute force, but because he possesses a subtle **Dao/Way**. He can exhaust the land’s resources without earning a reputation for cunning, dominate all things without displaying valor, and conquer without being defeated, attaining the **Way** of perpetual victory.\n\nYielding opens, concealing closes—endless transformations, guiding ministers and ruling the world without being fathomed. Thus, he governs others without being governed himself, for his power originates from above and rests with the sovereign, and the world is thereby governed.\n\nLǚ Jìfǔ said: Just as a fish cannot be separated from the depths, so too must a person not abandon softness and yielding—otherwise, they are doomed to death.\n\nThe ultimate softness traverses the ultimate rigidity; without entering any gap, it is the sharpest of tools. Wielding such tools to govern the world, a state’s strategies lie in the intangible—how can one reveal their origins?\n\nThus it is said: *A state’s most potent tools must not be revealed to others.*\n\nWáng Yuànzé said: Fish submit to softness and yielding, hiding in the depths to preserve themselves. The Sage retreats into seclusion, yet wields supreme authority alone, guiding all things beyond comprehension. Thus, he turns the heavens and earth effortlessly, yet none perceive his strength; he commands all under heaven, yet none attribute it to force. Would he expose his divine essence and let the masses debate it?\n\nI have pondered this: What distinguishes the Sage from others is his foresight (*knowing the few*). If one meets things with rigidity and strength, those things’ rigidity and strength become insurmountable. All under heaven rely on rigidity and strength to conquer. I alone dwell in softness and non-contention, yet when I act, who can resist?\n\nObserve the **Dao/Way** of Heaven: Autumn and winter give way to spring and summer—another verification. The Sage hides in the depths, yet presents softness and yielding as his exterior, guiding all things within their natural unfolding, while his essence remains unknown to all. This is what is called *secret action, solitary transformation*.\n\nThe *Yì* (I Ching) says: *Compliance enables the exercise of authority.*\nThe *Zhuāngzǐ* says: *Fish are trapped by calculation*—their meaning aligns here.\n\nThis passage speaks of compliance enabling authority, of softness and yielding prevailing over rigidity and strength. First expanding, then contracting—softness and yielding prevailing over rigidity and strength is evident. A person cannot abandon softness and yielding, just as a fish cannot be removed from the depths. The Sage wields potent tools yet does not reveal them—not because he relies on rigidity and strength, but because he embodies softness and yielding. Thus, he attains the **Way** of perpetual victory.\n\n---\n**Chapter Thirty-Seven: The Dao/Way Constantly Does Not-Act, Yet Does Not Fail to Act**\n\nShū Wáng said: Earlier, it was said that the **Dao/Way** constantly has no name—speaking of the **Dao/Way**’s essence. This chapter speaks of the **Dao/Way** constantly not-acting—speaking of the **Dao/Way**’s transformations.\n\nLíng Qì said: The **Dao/Way** as a formless form stands independent and unchanging, yet its form constantly resides in the utmost emptiness. The **Dao/Way** as a non-use that uses moves in cycles without beginning, yet its use encompasses all things. Because it is independent, it remains motionless and still, its essence complete and whole. Because it moves in cycles, it responds and communicates, its use encompassing all things thoroughly.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** exists as form yet is not form; it exists as use yet is not use. Though it does not-act, when it responds and communicates, it does not cease. Though it does not fail to act, it remains motionless and still alongside it. From its pairing and response, it is seen that it does not fail to act exhaustively, yet its ultimate return is to constant not-acting.\n\nBecause the **Dao/Way** constantly does not-act, it can do all things. Not-acting is motionless and still—the true essence of the **Dao/Way**, the so-called formless form. Not failing to act responds and communicates—the true use of the **Dao/Way**, the so-called non-use that uses. Thus it is said: *The **Dao/Way** constantly does not-act, yet does not fail to act.*\n\nIf lords and kings could uphold this,\n\nWáng Yuànzé said: A ruler embodying the **Dao/Way** to govern follows the times and aligns with principle without deliberate action, so though he does not-act, the world’s affairs are not neglected. Though the world’s affairs are not neglected, I have truly never acted. What does Heaven say?\n\nThe four seasons proceed, all things flourish—lords and kings’ **Dao/Way** exhausts Heaven’s purpose. All things will transform of their own accord.\n\n*御注*: When lords and kings uphold the **Dao/Way**, they govern the world from a realm of not-acting, and their actions emerge from not-acting, lending transformation to all things. All things transform as if by their own nature, unaware of the one who guides them—thus, it is said they transform of their own accord.\n\nShū Wáng said: Speaking of the **Dao/Way**’s essence, it is said: *All things will submit to it as guests.* Speaking of the **Dao/Way**’s transformations, it is said: *All things will transform of their own accord.* When lords and kings uphold the **Dao/Way**, they do not-act. All things transform of their own accord through the **Dao/Way**, hence it does not fail to act.",

Observing the end of the Three Dynasties, where customs and morals became refined and exhausted, one can understand this.\n\nI shall govern with the nameless simplicity of the Uncarved Block.\n\nZhuān Wēi said: The **virtue/power** of the Sage’s transformation always rescues people. If there are those who do not submit to his transformation, yet cultivate sincerity in themselves and extend this cultivation universally to the world, then if lords and kings know and uphold it, will not the world’s cultivation be universal?\n\nHe who does not hoard the **Dao/Way** yet seeks to share its benevolence with the world—this is the **Dao/Way** of the lords and kings. To seek to share it with the world, one must first uphold it as lords and kings. Yet scholars, seeing only his words, speak of abandoning benevolence and righteousness, saying: *\"Laozi undermines and belittles my benevolence and righteousness; I will not accept this.\"* Alas, they do not see the intent behind the abandonment, so it is fitting they reject it.\n\nLù Xīshēng said: The first chapter establishes the **Dao/Way** as its substance, common names as its function, and culminates in the *Yet More Mysterious*. This chapter takes *not-acting* as its substance, *without-not-acting* as its function, and unifies them under *comprehensive forgetting*.

Thus, the world does not await correction but corrects itself naturally.\n\nLǐ Tián said: The Great **Dao/Way** takes emptiness and stillness as its true constancy, and responsive application as its subtlety. If lords and kings uphold its true constancy—remaining motionless in tranquility—and model its subtle applications, responding and thus harmonizing, then all things will transform in purity and the world will be rectified.\n\nThis chapter begins by speaking of the **Dao/Way**’s constancy in *not-acting* yet *without-not-acting*, and concludes with the *nameless simplicity of the Uncarved Block* without desire. If one harbors the desire for simplicity, it is not true *not-acting*. The *nameless simplicity of the Uncarved Block* in *comprehensive forgetting*—this is the **Dao/Way**’s constancy in *not-acting*.

no true praise.\n\n*Tang Ming Huang* notes:\nThe character *shù* (数) is pronounced with an ascending tone,\nwhile *yù* (誉) is pronounced as *yùzi* (舆子).\n\n*Say* explains:\nWhen *shù* (数) and *yù* (舆) are attained,\nthere is no *yù* (舆) left—\nthe axle is the foundation of the wheel.\nWhen *shù* (数) and nobility are attained,\nthere is no true nobility—\nlowliness is the root of nobility.\nThe axle is the foundation of the wheel,\nso one must preserve the axle to stabilize the wheel.\nLowliness is the root of nobility,\nso one must uphold lowliness to secure nobility.\nThus, this passage warns lords and kings to take lowliness as their foundation,\nand so it speaks of attaining *shù* (数) and *yù* (舆).\n\n*Wang Yuanze* says:\nThe character *shù* (数) is pronounced with an entering tone,\nwhile *yù* (舆) is the character for *yù* (誉, praise).\n\n*Say* explains:\nThose who grasp the One\nuse lowliness as their foundation,\nyet internally conceal the utmost nobility—\nthe world cannot attain them,\nand they do not seek to be attained by the world.\nIf lowliness is truly their own,\nand they govern with praise and reputation,\nis this truly praise?\n\nThey do not wish to be polished like jade,\nnor rugged like stone.\n*Commentary* says:\nJade is noble, while stone is lowly,\nyet both are fixed and unchanging.\nThe Sage adapts to the times and follows the natural order,\nunhindered in all transformations.\nThough the myriad changes are without constancy,\nmy heart remains ever One—\nthis is the true grasp of the One.\nThus, one cannot be attained in terms of nobility or lowliness.\n\n*Mencius* said:\nWhat I dislike about those who cling to the One\nis that they cling to the One while abandoning the hundred.\nThey do not wish to be polished like jade,\nnor rugged like stone—\nthis is not merely knowing the transformations;\neven the Sage cannot surpass it.\nThis is what is called *shàngdé* (上德, highest virtue).\n\n*Héshàng Gōng* (河上公) says:\n*Lìnglìng* (琭琭) is a metaphor for scarcity,\n*luòluò* (落落) is a metaphor for abundance.\nJade is scarce, hence it appears noble.\nStone is abundant, hence it appears lowly.\nThe saying does not wish to be like jade,\nto be held in others’ esteem,\nnor like stone,\nto be held in others’ contempt.\nOne must dwell in the balance between them.\n\n*Wang Yuanze* says:\nJade and stone are firm and unyielding,\nfixed and unable to bend or change—\nthis is not the One.\nBut if one embraces the myriad transformations while remaining ever One,\nthen this is the true One.\nThus, jade is polished and noble,\nyet cannot be lowly.\nStone is rugged and lowly,\nyet cannot be noble.\n*Lǎo Shì* (老氏, Laozi) having illuminated the One’s meaning,\nfeared that some might grasp the One as unchanging,\nrigid like jade or stone,\nand thus lose the true essence of the One.\n\nOnly those who embody the One\nare both noble and lowly—\ntheir virtue is like water,\nadapting to square, round, crooked, or straight,\nendlessly responding to all things,\nyet never departing from the One.\nThus, they cannot be attained in terms of nobility or lowliness,\nfor the One transcends all nobility and lowliness.\nThis passage’s meaning is the most profound and difficult to express;\nnow I merely outline its core principles.\n\nThe Dao gives birth to the One,\nand the One is the completeness of virtue.\nWhen embodied in things,\nit approaches the Dao.\nThis chapter takes the One as its central theme.\n\nThe One is the utmost refinement of the world.\nHeaven, Earth, gods, and things—\nnoble or lowly, moving or still, growing or decaying—\nall derive from the One to achieve their forms.\nThe *Tàishàng* (太上) fears that people will cling to the One\nwithout understanding transformation,\nand so concludes with *bùyù* (不欲, \"do not wish\"),\nfor those who are rigid like jade or stone\nlose the true meaning of the One.\n\nI humbly believe that the *Tàishàng*’s Dao\nbegins with refining *jīng* (精, essence) as its foundation,\nthen perfecting the *shén* (神, spirit) as its wondrous Way.\nIf the foundation is not established,\nthen the Dao has no means to arise,\nso the One is taken as the foundation,\njust as essence is refined to perfect the spirit.\n\nIt concludes with jade and stone,\nfearing that people will cling to refining essence\nwithout nurturing the spirit.\nEven if their lifespan equals that of tortoise and crane,\nthey will never hope to attain the Dao of immortality.\nOnly when both essence and spirit are refined\nand harmonized with the Dao\nis this the true attainment.\n\n*End of Volume Six of the Collected Virtues of the Dao/De True Classic*\n*End of Volume Seven of the Collected Virtues of the Dao/De True Classic*",

      "translated_text": "---\n\n**Volume Eight of the Collected Virtues of the Dao/De True Classic**\n\n**Chapter Forty: The Dao’s Movement Lies in Reversal**\n\nReversal is the Dao’s movement.\nWang Yuanze said: *\"To return to the origin is to be still; only stillness can give rise to movement—*\n*just as autumn and winter give rise to spring and summer.\"*\n\nSu Ziyou said: *\"Reversal is restoration; to restore one’s nature is to be still.*\n*Yet though it remains motionless and tranquil,*\n*it responds and thus communicates with all things under Heaven—*\n*this is how movement originates from stillness.*\n\n*Gazing upward at Heaven,*\n*the four seasons unfold,*\n*withdrawing and storing in winter,*\n*and flourishing and renewing in spring.*\n*Looking downward at Earth,*\n*the Five Phases have water,*\n*which reverses its flow to complete the One,*\n*and thus moves beneficially with the times.*\n*The Dao of Heaven and Earth lies in reversal,*\n*so they endure eternally.*\n*Once a person receives their formed body,*\n*they abandon its nature,*\n*like a vessel among myriad things,*\n*never reversing throughout their life—*\n*alas, the sorrow of it.*\n\n**Chapter Forty-One: The Weakness of the Dao**\n\nThe weak are the Dao’s instrument.\nShu Wang said: *\"The Dao’s instrument lies in weakness,*\n*for it is empty.*\n*Consider Heaven—*\n*even when it points to me, it also overcomes me,*\n*and when it overcomes me, it also points to me.*\n*Thus, the wind moving through the boundless void*\n*may be called weak.*\n*Yet nothing fails to be stirred by it,*\n*no form fails to be swept by it—*\n*so the wind’s power lies in its weakness.*\n*Consider Earth—*\n*when guided to the east, it flows east,*\n*when guided to the west, it flows west.*\n*Thus, water entrusted to the depths of the void*\n*may be called weak.*\n*Yet it dwells where all others abhor,*\n*and assaults the firm and strong,*\n*none can surpass it—*\n*so water’s power lies in its weakness.\"*\n\nHe further said: *\"Reversal is not the means by which movement arises,*\n*yet there is what is called movement—*\n*movement arises from reversal.*\n*Weakness is not the means by which strength arises,*\n*yet there is what is called strength—*\n*for weakness can give rise to strength.*\n*Though it speaks of reversal without mentioning stillness,*\n*speaks of weakness without mentioning strength,*\n*when it speaks of movement, one knows reversal is stillness,*\n*and when it speaks of weakness, one knows its use is strength.*\n*All things under Heaven are born from existence,*\n*existence from non-existence—*\n*and it is just so with this.*\n\n*Weakness overcoming strength,*\n*the Dao’s wondrous use—*\n*as water, the weakest,*\n*can assault the firm and strong.*\n*All things under Heaven are born from existence,*\n*existence from non-existence.*\n*He Shang Gong said:*\n*‘All things arise from Heaven and Earth,*\n*Heaven and Earth have form and position,*\n*thus they are said to be born from existence.’*\n*‘The divine luminosity of Heaven and Earth all arise from the Dao,*\n*the Dao has no form,*\n*thus it is said to be born from non-existence.’*\n*Lu Jipu said:*\n*‘Only existence can give birth to all things under Heaven,*\n*yet non-existence can also give birth to all things of existence—*\n*thus the Dao’s movement lies in reversal,*\n*and its use in weakness is known.’*\n*So then, to seek reversal and weakness is no other thing,*\n*but to perfect the One and reach the utmost of non-existence.*\n\n*The meaning of this chapter:*\n*To return to the origin and be still,*\n*then movement will not be lost.*\n*As Zhuangzi said:*\n*‘Stillness gives rise to movement,*\n*movement attains its purpose.’*\n*The Dao’s use is never not beneficial,*\n*so without contention, it can overcome strength—*\n*as the Classic says:*\n*‘The weak overcome the strong.’*\n*So then, to seek reversal and weakness is no other thing,*\n*but to perfect the One and reach the utmost of non-existence.*\n\n**Chapter Forty-One: The Superior Person Hears the Dao**\n\nThe superior person hears the Dao\nand diligently practices it.\n*[Commentary:] A person of virtue who aspires to the Dao.*\n\nThe superior person hears the Dao,\nwith true virtue accumulating strength over time,\nand utmost sincerity ceasing not.\nLi Rong said: *\"The more one believes in the Dao,*\n*the more resolute one’s practice becomes.*\n*Changing seasons do not alter their resolve,*\n*melting gold and stone cannot move their conduct.*\n*Firm from beginning to end,*\n*steadfast without artifice—*\n*this is the superior person’s movement in practice.\"*\n\nThe term *‘superior’* (上) refers to the highest rank.\nThe term *‘person’* (士) refers to one who takes the Dao as their calling.\nThe superior person, having attained enlightenment,\nhears this wondrous Dao.\nThe more they believe in the Dao,\nthe more resolute their practice becomes.\nPractice and reality correspond,\nwhether appearing or withdrawing,\nwhether acting or dwelling,\nalways relying on reality without separation.\nTrue enlightenment grows with every thought,\nthe cultivation of the heart never falters—\nthus it is called *‘movement in practice.’*\n\n*A question arises:*\n*The Dao cannot be heard,*\n*yet if one hears it, it is false—*\n*how then does the superior person hear it?*\n*An answer is given:*\n*‘To hear with the ears and practice with the heart,*\n*this is true hearing.’*\n*Confucius said:*\n*‘To hear the Dao in the morning,*\n*and die in the evening,*\n*that is enough.’*\n\nThe middle person hears the Dao\nas if it exists and yet does not exist.\nShu Wang said: *\"The middle person knows the Dao as beautiful,*\n*yet does not know what constitutes the Dao.*\n*Knowing the Dao as beautiful,*\n*they hear it like the great sound*\n*that does not enter the vulgar ear.\"*\n\nLi Rong said: *\"Unspun silk does not resist change,*\n*yet follows the shifting hues of black and yellow.*\n*The middle person is undetermined,*\n*their heart shifts with their likes and dislikes.*\n*If they hear the true Dao for preserving life and stabilizing the realm,*\n*they cherish the Dao and forget the world.*\n*If they see wealth, beauty, or sensual pleasures,*\n*they delight in their nature to gratify their desires—*\n*then they cherish the world and forget the Dao.*\n*The middle person can ascend or descend,*\n*yet they harbor doubt in their heart.*\n*Doubt arises, and their resolve is divided,*\n*so though they hear the Dao,*\n*they govern their body to prolong life,*\n*and govern the realm to achieve great peace,*\n*they rejoice and yet cling to it.*\n*When they retreat and see wealth, beauty, or honor,*\n*they may again forget it in their emotions and desires—*\n*then they cannot move and practice it.*\n*One moment they emerge,*\n*one moment they withdraw—*\n*like Zi Xia, who emerged to see the bustling splendor,*\n*the dazzling beauty, and delighted in it,*\n*yet hearing the Master’s Dao,*\n*he took joy in that instead.\"*\n\nThe inferior person hears the Dao\nand laughs loudly at it.\nWang Yuanze said: *\"The Dao is vast, resembling what is not like,*\n*unrecognized by shallow vision—*\n*thus they laugh.*\n*Indeed, as the following text says:*\n*‘How could the vulgar ever perceive it?’*\nZhi Cong said: *\"The inferior person hears of this wondrous Dao,*\n*formless, nameless,*\n*neither coming nor going,*\n*neither born nor extinguished—*\n*not believing in it,*\n*they instead rebel against it,*\n*so they clap their hands and laugh loudly,*\n*calling it empty and false.*\n*The inferior person is born with lowly nature,*\n*indulging their emotions and many desires,*\n*their wisdom insufficient to discern,*\n*their understanding insufficient to know.*\n*They admire beauty with their eyes,*\n*desire to hear sounds with their ears,*\n*crave to taste flavors with their

Dao,\none can penetrate the self and the other,\ntraverse hills and mountains—\nsubtle, mysterious, and boundless,\nwithout obstruction or hindrance.\nThis is called galloping across the supreme firmness.\n\nThe supreme softness is water.\nThe supreme firmness is metal and stone.\nWater can penetrate the firm and enter the hard,\npassing through all without obstruction.\nWater, being supremely soft, nearly attains Dao.\nHow much more so the formless!\n\nThe supreme softness of Dao\nenvelops heaven and earth,\npenetrates all things—\nthis is how softness overcomes hardness.\n\n\"Galloping\" means penetrating and flowing freely.\n\n*The Classic* says:\nNothing is softer or weaker than water,\nyet nothing surpasses it in attacking the firm and strong.\nIt enters without gap—\n*Riverbank Master* said: \"Without gap\" refers to Dao.\nDao has no form or substance,\nthus it enters and exits without obstruction,\ncommuning with the divine and benefiting all beings.\n\n*Yan Zun* said:\nFormed things cannot pierce sharpness,\nbut the formless divine dwells within—\nentering without openings, exiting without traces,\nin the blink of an eye, traversing thousands of miles.\n\"Without gap\" is the divine.\n\nThe divine’s work—\nits utility in entering and exiting—\nleaves no trace,\npiercing metal, penetrating stone,\nentering without gap.\nThe divine resides in the heart,\nthe heart harbors the divine.\nEmpty the heart to preserve the divine,\npreserve the divine to seek the ultimate.\nStraightforward, it pushes forward;\ncurved, it yields.\nIn all directions—up, down, left, right—\nit rests where it will,\nendless in coming and going,\ncirculating through the boundless void,\nascending to the heavens, descending to the earth,\nsixfold passage, fourfold opening—\nnowhere it enters without finding its own way.\n\nThus I know the benefit of *wuwei*.\n\n*Imperial Commentary*:\nSoftness overcoming hardness,\nthe void embracing the having—\nthe marvelous function of Dao lies here.\nAbandoning affairs, the form does not labor;\nforgetting life, the essence does not diminish—\nthis is how it is beneficial.\n\n*Wang Bi* said:\nSoftness and weakness, emptiness and void—\nnothing they cannot penetrate.\nThe supremely soft cannot be bent,\nthe void cannot be exhausted—\nthus, by extension, one knows the benefit of *wuwei*’s Dao.\n\n*Li Rong* said:\nDao is formless, yet things obtain life;\nthe sage acts without doing, yet people are transformed—\nthis is the benefit of *wuwei*.\n\nSoftness is the root of Dao,\nthe void is its function—\nthe supremely soft and void is Dao.\nDao acts without doing, yet all things transform—\nthus one knows the benefit of *wuwei*’s Dao.\n\nThe teaching of the unsaid,\nthe benefit of *wuwei*—\nfew in the world attain it.\n\n*Imperial Commentary*:\nThe teaching of the unsaid is set by the divine,\nthe benefit of *wuwei* does not deplete the true.\nThe sage embraces simplicity,\nand the world submits as a guest.\n*Wuwei* yet all things transform—\nthus those who attain it are few.\n\n*Gu Huan* said:\nFollowing Dao without words, yet customs shift—\nthus

precious as the pearl of Huai—\nthen body and wealth—\nwhich is more abundant?\nThe most desired name is within me—\nit is not intimate.\nThe most abundant wealth is within me—\nit is not abundant.\nOnly those who fail to discern intimacy and distance,\nabundance and scarcity,\nruin life and harm nature,\nsacrificing the body for it—\nlike Boyi starving to death for name beneath Chief Yang’s hill,\nor Zhi the robber dying for gain at Dongling’s peak—\nis this not delusion?\n\n*Li Rong* said:\nThe body is the foundation for cultivating Dao—\nthus it is intimate.\nFame is a hollow convention—\nthus it is distant.\nPeople cannot sacrifice the body for name;\nthey only sacrifice the body for name.\n\n*Wang Bi* said:\nTo prize name and seek loftiness—\none’s body will be distant.\nTo covet wealth without satisfaction—\none’s body will be diminished.\n\n*Lu Jifu* said:\nThe resolve of the virtuous is for name—\nyet to ruin life and harm nature,\nthey do not know the body’s intimacy to name.\nThus it is said: Name and body—\nwhich is more intimate?\nThe resolve of the greedy is for wealth—\nyet to ruin life and harm nature,\nthey do not know the body’s abundance

Xuanzong of Tang said:\nTo love name excessively is to exhaust one’s spirit—is this not great expenditure?\nTo hoard wealth excessively is to burden oneself—is this not great loss?\n\nLiu Jinxi said:\nInsatiable greed is called excessive love.\nExcessive desire harms the body, hence it is called great expenditure.\n\nLu Jifu said:\nTo love name is to desire wealth and noble status for oneself.\nBecause of this excessive love, one loses even the finest virtues—this is great expenditure.\nTo hoard wealth is to desire riches for oneself.\nBecause of this excessive accumulation, one loses even the greatest riches—this is great loss.\n\nKnowing contentment brings no disgrace.\nKnowing when to stop brings no peril.\nThus one may endure and live long.\n\nEmperor Xuanzong of Tang said:\nDisgrace is loss and burden.\nPeril is danger and ruin.\nTo shun fame is to know contentment.\nTo refrain from amassing wealth is to know when to stop.\nKnowing contentment, one’s name matches reality without excess burden.\nKnowing when to stop, one does not hoard wealth without the harm of greed.\nWithout disgrace or peril, one may endure and live long.\n\nLi Rong said:\nNot seeking name through external means is to avoid disgrace.\nNot pursuing wealth against reason is to avoid peril.\nTo distance oneself from name and profit is to distance oneself from peril.\nThus, governing a state may endure, and cultivating oneself may last long.\n\nLu Jifu said:\nOnly those with virtue know the true nobility within themselves and need no external name.\nThus, knowing contentment brings no disgrace.\nOnly those with true wealth know the abundance within themselves and need no external riches.\nThus, knowing when to stop brings no peril.\nWithout disgrace or peril, one may endure long.\n\nThis chapter’s intent is that those who seek longevity must first abandon profit and forget fame.\nIf name and profit are not discarded, body and mind are enslaved—\nnot only does this obstruct the Dao,\nbut in time, it will harm the body.\nThus, ancient masters of the Dao\ndid not seek fame,\ndid not amass wealth.\nThough they held high office or vast emoluments,\nthey discarded them like worn-out shoes,\nviewed them as passing clouds.\nSome took joy in coarse rice and water,\nothers dwelled in humble huts.\nMinisters of state could not recognize them,\nemperors could not command them as subjects.\nThey lived in forests and caves,\nate pine shoots and drank from streams.\nWould they harm the true essence of life\nfor the fleeting illusions of fame and wealth?\nThis is the utmost warning for Daoist practice,\nthe essential duty of self-cultivation.\nThus, ancient examples are cited—\nthose who seek the Dao must cast off these shackles.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Five: Great Fullness as if Deficient**\n\nGreat fullness as if deficient—\nits use is unexhausted.\n\n*Official Commentary:*\nWithin the realm, there are four great principles, and the Dao occupies one.\nTo embody the Dao fully is why it may be called \"great.\"\nWithout completion or deficiency, this is called \"great fullness.\"\nNot having its fullness, it is as if deficient.\nUnderstanding transformation and adaptation,\nyet not clinging to fixed forms,\nits use is unexhausted.\nThis is how Confucius gathered the great teachings and became the Sage of his time.\n\nRiver Master Hu said:\nThis refers to a ruler of great virtue and fullness,\nas if deficient—\nerasing his name, concealing his reputation,\nlike a broken vessel lacking completeness.\nIf one’s mind is thus, there is no time of exhaustion.\n\n*Zuanwei* said:\nDeficient means broken.\nExhausted means ruin and defeat.\nGreat fullness refers to a person of complete virtue.\nOne whose virtue fills within\ncan embrace chaos and contain filth.\nThough their form may be fragmented,\nlike a vessel with cracks and stains,\nrarely is their use seen—\nthus they preserve their completeness\nand avoid the ruin of exhaustion.\n\nThose who achieve success are deficient in it.\nThose who achieve success but do not dwell on it\nthus do not abandon it.\nThose who achieve fame gather it,\nbut if they do not cling to empty reputation,\ntheir fame does not fade.\nThe Perfect One sees the forms of completion and decay,\nthus abandons success and fame,\nand returns to the common way.\nTheir Dao is great and full,\nyet ever as if deficient.\n\nEmperor Yao achieved success yet saw himself as deficient—\nthus he became the greatest of the Five Emperors.\nConfucius gathered the great teachings yet did not dwell on his sainthood—\nthus he became the teacher of all ages.\nHis use grows ever newer, never exhausted—\nhow could it be worn out?\n\n**Great Fullness as if Empty**\n\nIts use is inexhaustible.\n\n*Official Commentary:*\nFilling all without boundary,\nsurpassing all things—this is great fullness.\nEmpty to respond to all things,\nsimple yet effective—\nthus its application is boundless,\nits use inexhaustible.\n\nA wise merchant hides his goods deep,\nyet appears empty and virtuous,\nhis demeanor as if foolish.\n\nLu Jifu said:\nAll things are measured from it yet it is never depleted—this is fullness.\nYet when added to, it does not increase—\nthus it is as if empty.\nOnly because it is as if empty\nis its use ever renewed and inexhaustible.\n\nLuosha said:\nWisdom without accumulation is called fullness.\nEmpty yet upright—this is called \"empty.\"\nSpeaking of those who are greatly full,\nthey forget their fullness,\nthough full, they appear empty—\nempty, they are not depleted.\nIf their use is thus,\nthen it has no end.\n\nThe moon wanes when full,\nthe satisfied mind is diminished.\nThe Perfect One knows the cycles of fullness and emptiness,\nyet though full, remains as if empty.\n\n**Great Straightness as if Bent**\n\nWang Bi said:\nTo follow things in straightness—\nstraightness does not lie within oneself—\nthus it appears bent.\n\nLuosha said:\nUpright in principle, without deviation—this is straightness.\nTo conform to things in bending—this is bent.\nThe body may be bent,\nbut the Dao cannot be bent.\nGreat straightness is bending the self to extend the Dao.\n\nGoulu Hui was dismissed three times for his straight path yet did not leave.\n\n**Great Skill as if Clumsy**\n\nSu Shi said:\nSkill without clumsiness\nwould labor in

their fields.\n\n\"Governed by the Dao\" refers to a ruler who follows the Way.\n\"Driven back\" means to withdraw.\n\"Warhorses\" are steeds that gallop.\n\"Manure\" means to fertilize fields.\nIt speaks of a ruler who governs the world with the Dao—\ncontent with little, knowing sufficiency,\nseeking nothing from beyond,\nnot employing arms or martial arts,\nabandoning warfare and cultivating culture,\nwith no battles or pursuits—\nonly tending to the fundamental occupations,\nthus withdrawing the galloping steeds\nto till the fields.\n\nFor those cultivating the self,\nthe mind-horse does

a man of the Dao.\n\n*Excerpt from the True Classic of Dao and Virtue, Volume Seven of the Collected Goodness of the Song Dynasty*\n*Collected by Resident Master Li Lin of Raoyang*\n*Chapter Forty-Seventh: Not Leaving the Door*\n\nNot leaving the door, one knows the world.\nNot peering through the window, one sees the Dao of Heaven.\n\nWang Huibian said:\nThe traveler, with an empty heart and inner stillness,\ndoes not let the mind gallop through the world’s affairs,\nnor does he labor in grasping at external things.\nWith true discernment of falsehood,\nall matters become thoroughly known.\n\nLu Tian said:\nAll things are already complete within me.\nThere is the Dao of Heaven, the Dao of Earth, the Dao of Man.\nIf one turns inward to seek them without being deceived by the external,\nthen the Dao of Man can be known without leaving the door,\nand the Dao of Heaven can be seen without peering through the window.\n\nThough the world be vast, the sage knows it through the Dao.\nThough the Dao of Heaven be distant, the sage sees it with the heart.\nWhen heart and Dao align,\nand one observes the world through the Dao,\nthere is nothing distant that cannot be discerned—\nthus, no need to leave the door.\nWhen one sees the Dao of Heaven with the heart,\nthere is no height it cannot reach—\nthus, no need to peer through the window.\n\nYang Zi said:\nHow wondrous is the human heart!\nWhen held, it exists; when released, it vanishes.\nWho but the sage can constantly hold and preserve it?\nThe sage preserves the spirit to its utmost,\nharmonizing with the juncture of Heaven and Man,\nmaking them unbroken.\nThe farther one goes, the less one knows.\n\nCai Zi Huang said:\nThose without the Dao cannot examine themselves or know others.\nTheir minds race after external phenomena—\nthough they leave the door and travel far,\nor peer through windows to gaze at stars,\ntheir knowledge and perception remain scant,\nfor they abandon themselves to seek without.\n\nLü Jifu said:\nThe world is vast, indeed boundless—\nif one waits to leave before knowing it,\nthen the reach of one’s strength is limited,\nand how much can one truly know?\nThe Dao of Heaven is distant, indeed unfathomable—\nif one waits to peer before seeing it,\nthen the reach of one’s sight is limited,\nand how much can one truly see?\nThus it is said:\n*The farther one goes, the less one knows.*\n\nWang Yuanzhe said:\nThe boundless principle is exhausted in a single mote of dust.\nNo subtle thought arises, all entanglements manifest.\nIs not this where the study of the Dao lies?\nYet some seek it afar—how blind they are!\nThe farther one goes, the less one knows—\nis this not so?\n\nThus the sage acts without going, knows without seeing,\naccomplishes without doing.\n\n*Commentary:*\nTo know the world with one’s wisdom is called *knowing without going*.\nTo see the Dao of Heaven with one’s heart is called *seeing without peering*.\nTo know without going, to see without peering—\nwhat need is there for action?\nYet lofty indeed is their accomplishment—\nthis is called *accomplishing without doing*.\nTheir knowledge is divine in discerning human affairs—\nEmperor Yao and Shun knew the world could be known.\nThen the vastness of Heaven and its unity—\nYao and Shun saw the Dao of Heaven could be known.\nTo know without going, to see without peering—\nwhat need is there for action?\nOnly to rectify oneself and face south—\nthus it is said: *accomplishing without doing*.\nThis chapter speaks of the Dao itself—\nthere is the Dao of Heaven, the Dao of Man.\nThough Heaven and Man differ, their Dao communicates.\nThe sage aligns heart with Dao,\nand though the world be vast,\nit can be known without leaving the door.\nThough the Dao of Heaven be distant,\nit can be seen without peering through the window.\nTo know without going, to see without peering,\nto accomplish without doing.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Eighth: Daily Increase for Learning, Daily Decrease for the Dao**\n\n*Commentary:*\nLearning seeks to attain the Dao—\nbeginning as a scholar, ending as a sage.\nDaily increase accumulates within oneself.\nConfucius said to Yan Yuan:\n*\"I see his progress—\nthe seeker of the Dao discards limbs and senses,\nabandons form and intelligence,\nand all affairs dissolve into forgetfulness—\nthus it is called *decrease*.\"*\n\nLian Boyu thus lived sixty years and transformed sixty times.\nThose who cultivate the True begin as scholars seeking the Dao,\nand end as sages who have attained it.\nWhile striving in learning to exhaust principles,\nand examining all things to seek harmony,\nit is called *increase*.\nFor the Dao, one exhausts nature and reaches supreme emptiness—\nall things are known to be false,\nand though one does not intend to decrease,\nall that was gradually fades away.\n\nFirst speaking of the learner—\nif one does not learn, one cannot clearly see goodness,\nnor firmly believe in the Dao,\nand thus cannot govern it.\nHaving attained the Dao, one must abandon learning—\nif one does not abandon learning,\nthen the more one hears and sees, the more one drowns in excess,\nand the heart cannot embody the Dao—\nthus later speaking of *daily decrease for the Dao*.\n\nThus it is said:\n*Beginning with learning to attain the Dao,*\n*ending with attaining the Dao to abandon learning—*\n*then one is a fully true man.*\n\nDecrease again, and again decrease,\nuntil reaching *wuwei* [non-action].\n\nCheng Xuanying said:\nThe learner clings to desires.\nThe man of the Dao lingers in *wuwei*.\nThough shallow and deep differ,\nboth are forms of stagnation.\nNow to dispel these two fixations,\nthere is the text of *double decrease*—\nfirst to decrease the *having*,\nthen to decrease the *non-having*—\nboth extremes of learning and Dao are cast aside,\nneither *having* nor *non-having*—\nthis is the single accord.\n\nShu Wang said:\nTo exhaust principles and fulfill nature,\none must return to the original command.\nThus *decrease again, and again decrease*,\nuntil reaching *wuwei*—\nthis is returning to the command.\nYet the command is not hastily restored—\none must first exhaust and then restore,\nonly then reaching the command—\nthus it is said:\n*Decrease again, and again decrease*,\nuntil reaching *wuwei*.\n\nLü Jifu said:\nTo decrease is still to engage in action.\nTo decrease even the act of decreasing,\nonly then reaching *wuwei*—\n*wuwei* yet nothing remains undone.\n\nLuó Shì said:\nTo decrease is to have no surplus to discard,\nto discard until

their own life—\nthus they never die, nor do they ever truly live.\nWhen the Dao reaches this state,\neven though their form may have *meditation* (禅),\ntheir spirit never alters—\nhow could death come to them?\nThis is the sacred and divine of the Central Realm,\nand the Buddha of the Western Land.\n\nIf one were to change and fluctuate without constancy,\nwater and fire could not scorch or drench them,\naxes and saws could not wound or sicken them.\nThey ride the void yet touch the solid,\nand go where none can pass—\nthen desires of the world cannot grasp them,\nhow much more could they harm?\n\nSomeone said:\nThen why call them *preserving life* (摄生)?\nThey replied:\nDescend one degree from this,\nand you enter the realm of birth-and-death.\nAll who preserve life must reach this state first,\nthen life remains ever constant.\nThis is akin to the profound virtue of those who contain *virtue/power* (德).\nWen Gong said:\nThe rhinoceros and tiger are metaphors for the strong and violent.\nThose who dwell among the strong and violent yet suffer no harm\ndo so because they are gentle, weak, and do not contend.\n\nLuo Shi said:\n*Realm* (地) is akin to *birth* (生).\nBecause they preserve life without clinging to birth,\nthe three poisons cannot harm them.\nThis chapter speaks of the Dao of life-and-death,\nexpressed in ten words,\neach containing three meanings within.\n\nOnly those who excel in preserving life\nhave the Dao unified in one,\ntranscending these three categories—\neven rhinoceroses, tigers, swords, and armies\ndare not harm them,\nthus it is said they have no deathly realm.\n\n**Chapter 51: The Dao Gives Birth (道生之)**\nThe Dao gives birth to them,\n*Virtue/Power* (德) nurtures them,\nthings take form,\nand circumstances complete them.\n\n*Commentary*: Once form and substance are complete,\nthe body and its circumstances are established—\nthe relative shapes of long and short,\nhigh and low, are thus determined.\nLu Jiufu said:\nThe birth of all things\nis always rooted in the *nameless* (无名),\nwhile their nurturing lies in the *one* yet unformed (一而未形),\nat the moment when things begin to take shape.\nThe *nameless* is the Dao,\nthe *one* yet unformed, which allows things to be born, is *Virtue/Power* (德).\nWhen they become things,\nthey are merely forms—\nnot the means by which they were born and nurtured.\nOnce forms are manifest,\nthe naked must remain naked,\nthose with scales, shells, feathers, or fur must remain so,\nand the young, the mature, the old, and the dying\ncannot escape their respective stages—\nall these are the inevitable consequences of circumstances.\nThus it is said:\n*The Dao gives birth to them,\nVirtue/Power nurtures them,\nthings take form,\nand circumstances complete them.*\n\nThe Dao gives birth to spirit,\nVirtue/Power distributes *qi* (气),\nand through its flowing motion, it gives rise to things—\nwhen things are born and their nature established, that is *form* (形).\nThus all things reverence the Dao\nand honor Virtue/Power.\n\nLu Jiufu said:\nCircumstances arise from form,\nform arises from Virtue/Power,\nand Virtue/Power arises from the Dao.\nThe Dao and Virtue/Power are the root,\nform and circumstances are the branches—\nthe root is revered while the branches are held low,\nthe root is honored while the branches are despised—\nthus all things reverence the Dao\nand honor Virtue/Power.\n\nThe Dao is the origin from which all things come,\ndescending as the pure essence that births and nurtures them.\nVirtue/Power is what things receive,\nabandoning harmony to cultivate their forms.\nWhen the Dao gives birth to things and acts as their father,\nthe Dao is revered while things are held low.\nRevered, it can overcome and diminish things.\nThis is what Zhuangzi called *True Sovereign* (真君).\n\nWhen Virtue/Power nurtures things and acts as their mother,\nVirtue/Power is honored while things are held low—\nthus things cannot despise it.\nThis is what Zhuangzi called *True Ruler* (真宰).\nThe reverence of the Dao,\nthe honor of Virtue/Power—\nnone can bestow these titles,\nyet they are ever naturally so.\n\nEmperor Ming of Tang said:\nSpeaking of the reverence and honor of the Dao and Virtue/Power,\nit is not conferred by external titles or commands,\nbut by the inherent function of giving birth and nurturing,\nwhich is ever naturally revered and honored.\n\nWang Yuanzé said:\nIf one’s life is decreed by Heaven, they become the Son of Heaven;\nif decreed by the Son of Heaven, they become a feudal lord—\nwherever life is received from another,\nthe giver can hold them low.\nOnly the Dao precedes all things\nand governs their life—\nwho could confer rank upon it?\nThus it is ever naturally revered.\n\nTherefore, the Dao gives birth, nurtures, lengthens, and matures them,\ncompletes and covers them.\nThis is profound!\n\nWhen all things transform and change,\nthe Dao gives birth with them;\nwhen all things gather and hide,\nthe Dao completes them.\nIt emerges from *Zhen* (震),\nis established in *Gèn* (艮),\nis nurtured in *Kūn* (坤),\nand is covered in *Qián* (乾).\nThe interplay of the firm and the yielding\ngrinds through the eight *trigrams* (卦),\nas though bound by a mechanism yet unable to resist—\nthe Dao truly transcends them.\n\n*Zhuǎn Wēi* said:\nThe previous passage spoke of the Dao giving birth and Virtue/Power nurturing.\nHere, Virtue/Power is not mentioned,\nfor the Dao’s single *qi* (气) permeates all without distinction,\nand the text omits the elaboration of Virtue/Power.\n\nTo receive its essence is to be born,\nto contain its *qi* is to be nurtured,\nto fulfill its form is to grow,\nto mark its *village* (村) is to mature—\n*Commentary*: This likely refers to the stages of life, not a literal village.\nTo aid its function is to complete,\nto reach its end is to be perfected,\nto preserve its harmony is to be nourished,\nto shield its harm is to be covered.\nThese eight aspects\nare the primordial functions of the Great Dao.\nHow could even the smallest living creature\nfail to revere and honor it?\n\nTo be born yet not possess its function,\nto act yet not rely on its ability,\nto grow yet not claim dominion—\nthis is called *Mysterious Virtue/Power* (玄德).\n\n*Commentary*: When the Dao gives birth to all things,\nif it were to show ownership,\nit would limit its benevolence.\nWhen it nurtures all things,\nif it were to claim its actions,\nit would dwell in its own works.\nWhen it grows and matures all creatures,\ncompletes and perfects all kinds,\nand sustains both living and non-living—\nif it were to boast its sovereignty,\nit would occupy its own length.\nSuch withdrawal into hidden depths\ncan be called profound and distant *hidden virtue/power* (阴德).\n\nEmperor Ming of Tang said:\nThis summarizes all eight meanings from above.\nThe Dao’s birth to all things,\nif it were to reveal itself as having,\nwould be constrained by its own benevolence.\nIts nurturing of all things,\nif it were to rely on its own actions,\nwould be limited by its own functions.\nIts growth and maturation of all creatures,\nits completion and perfection of all kinds,\nits sustenance of both living and non-living—\nif it were to arrogate its rule,\nit would be bound by its own length.\nThus, in possessing these qualities yet withdrawing into secrecy,\nits virtue is profound indeed,\nand its reach is distant.\nAs it was explained in the *Chapter on Nourishing the Vital Essence* (载营魄章).」",

(济其事) implies\nthat the **door** is not shut—\nthus, affairs do not remain sealed.\nIf one further its affairs,\nthen the **door** is not shut—\nthis is clear.\"*\n\nPei Chu’en said:\n*\"Opening the **ui** of the five desires,\nfurthering the affairs of the six dusts,\nwearies the spirit within,\nfatigues the senses without—\nthis is lifelong labor and exhaustion.\"*\n\n**Seeing the Small as Clarity (见小曰明)**\n**纂微曰**: *\"This means preventing issues before they arise,\nand addressing them before they become chaotic.\nIf one knows the art of closing **ui** and shutting **door**,\nthen one sees the small and subtle—\nseeing the small and subtle,\none’s affairs cannot grow dim;\nthis is called clarity.\nFor only those who preserve the **Mother**\never see the stirrings of their hearts.\nThe small and subtle are the Dao’s subtleties—\nseeing the Dao’s subtleties,\none knows oneself alone—\nthus, there is no lack of clarity.\"*\n\n**Preserving Softness as Strength (守柔曰强)**\nZhang Junxiang said:\n*\"Following the Dao without resistance is softness;\nbeginning and ending without loss is strength.\"*\nLu Jiufu said:\n*\"Preserving the formless utmost softness,\nand no thing can overcome it.\"*\n\n**Using Its Light, Returning to Its Clarity (用其光，复归其明)**\n**御注**: *\"Clarity (明) is the essence of light.\nLight (光) is the manifestation of clarity.\nWhen the Sage responds to the world,\nclarity manifests as light—\nthus, brilliance is light.\nGathering light back into clarity,\nwisdom penetrates as clarity.\nDisplaying all virtues outwardly,\nwhile concealing their applications—\nlike the sun and moon illuminating all things,\neach thing is clear and bright,\nyet nothing is diminished—\nthis is how the Sage’s **virtue/power** (德) is divine and profound.\"*\n\nHe Shangong said:\n*\"Using its light outwardly,\none must then return its clarity inwardly,\nlest the spirit be depleted.\nAvoiding harm to oneself,\nthis is called *clinging to constancy* (袭常).\"*\n**御注**: *\"The transformations of things are without constancy.\nOnly those who return to their original nature\nabandon things and separate from humanity,\nand return to their clarity,\nwithout transforming along with things—\ntheir essence remains constant,\nfree from peril,\ndiffering from those who merge with form and become light.\"*\n\nGu Huan said:\n*\"If one opens its **ui**,\nfurthering its affairs,\ndisaster and blame will surely come.\nYet this disaster is not external calamity—\nit is self-inflicted harm.\nReflecting light inward,\nobserving the spirit within,\nnot allowing it to leak away,\nthen one’s life will never suffer disaster and blame—\nthis is called the *path of profound constancy and enduring duration*

      "translated_text": "「The **Chapter on the Unshaken Foundation of Virtue/Power** (善建者不拔章第五十四):\n\n**A foundation of virtue/power that is not shaken** (善建者不拔),\n**Commentary of the Imperial Edict:** *The foundation is unshaken because it encompasses both the upper and lower aspects* (建中以该上下故不拔).\n**Explanation by Jie Jie:** *It speaks of those who embody the virtuous person (君子), establishing their body and mind with virtue/power and the Dao/Way. If they lack virtue/power to display, and no traces remain to be seen, then their roots are deep and their foundation firm, and they are not pulled away by the winds of right and wrong, desire or evil. If, however, those who establish virtue/power seek fame by cutting down virtue/power, flaunt their deeds to gain reward, and though their outward virtues are displayed, their hidden merit is not cultivated, they will ultimately be uprooted by the impermanent obstacles of karma. Thus, the **Huainanzi** says: \"A foundation of virtue/power is seen in one's appearance. Gold is consumed by fire, fire is extinguished by water, water is blocked by earth, wood is felled by an axe. Only that which is founded upon the foundationless (無建者) cannot be uprooted.\"*\n\n**Those who embrace virtue/power do not lose it** (善抱者不脱),\n**Annotations by Zuan Wei:** *Those who embrace the Dao/Way to hold the unity of the primal essence (元), then their vital essence and spirit (精神) remain whole and do not slip away.*\n**Commentary by Shū Wáng:** *To embrace (抱) is to be one (一). If one embraces unity and does not depart from it, then there is no loss.*\n**Sacrifices by descendants never cease.**\n**Commentary of the Imperial Edict:** *The foundation is centered within the Dao/Way and not external to it; embracing unity without separation from vital essence. If one is such, how could their influence be confined to a single state or generation? Rather, it will extend to the whole world and future ages, its transmission far indeed.*\n**Commentary by Tang Emperor Xuanzong:** *It speaks of a ruler who establishes virtue/power and embraces the Dao/Way, whose merit extends to posterity, cherishing the sweet osmanthus trees (甘棠) for their descendants. For rulers, their ancestors have merit, and their lineage has virtue/power. Thus, the rise of the Zhou began with Hou Ji and was completed by King Wen and King Wu. The Zhou sacrifices were made to Hou Ji at the outer altars (郊祀), and to King Wen at the ancestral temples (宗祀). Though divination predicted a change after thirty generations, and a span of seven hundred years, the destruction of the temple's main deity (毁庙之主) and the scattering of its influence (流溢於外), the sacrifices to Hou Ji and King Wen at the outer altars and ancestral temples never ceased.*\n\n**Cultivate it in oneself, and its virtue/power becomes true** (修之身，其德乃真);\n**Commentary by Dù Biàn:** *Illustrate the near cultivation and distant establishment of the Dao/Way in oneself, so that it does not slip away, and its roots are firm. Cultivating oneself in this way, true virtue/power lies within oneself.*\n\n**Cultivate it in the family, and its virtue/power overflows** (修之家，其德乃余);\n**Commentary by Hé Shàng Gōng:** *In a family that cultivates the Dao/Way, the father is benevolent, the son is filial, the elder brother is friendly, the younger brother is obedient, the husband is trustworthy, and the wife is chaste. Such virtue/power overflows indeed.*\n**Commentary by Wáng Bì:** *This extends from oneself to others.*\n\n**Cultivate it in oneself, and its virtue/power overflows; cultivate it in the family, and its virtue/power becomes long-lasting.**\n**Cultivate it in the community, and its virtue/power becomes abundant;**\n**Cultivate it in the state, and its virtue/power becomes plentiful;**\n**Cultivate it in the world, and its virtue/power becomes universal.**\n**Commentary of the Imperial Edict:** *Cultivate it in oneself, and its virtue/power becomes true. This is the Dao/Way’s true virtue/power to govern oneself. Cultivate it in the family, and its virtue/power overflows. Cultivate it in the community, and its virtue/power becomes long-lasting. This is the surplus extending to govern others. Cultivate it in the state, and its virtue/power becomes abundant. Cultivate it in the world, and its virtue/power becomes universal. This is the straight path to govern the world and its states. The farther one cultivates, the broader its virtue/power becomes. Within oneself, it is all true. In others, it is merely the superficial aspect. Thus, overflowing leads to long-lasting, and abundant leads to universal—these are external to the Dao/Way.*\n\n**Annotations by Zuan Wei:** *These five stages begin with near cultivation of oneself and extend far to the world. Thus, observe oneself to understand oneself; observe the family to understand the family...*\n\n**Commentary by Dào Chōng:** *Examine the gains and losses, right and wrong of oneself, and one will know all people. Examine the harmony or discord, prosperity or decline of one’s family, and one will know other families.*\n\n**Observe the community to understand the community; observe the state to understand the state; observe the world to understand the world.**\n**Commentary of the Imperial Edict:** *All things are complete within me. Reflecting sincerely upon oneself, no greater joy exists. Thus, by observing oneself to understand oneself, one’s self is governed. Extending this analogy...*\n\n**The world has its constants, yet by observing them, the world is governed.**\n**Annotations by Zuan Wei:** *To observe is to scrutinize and reflect. Thus, by the Dao/Way of sage-rulers (先、圣) to govern oneself, reflect upon my own body and mind. If my body and mind can embody the Dao/Way, then its virtue/power is true. By the Dao/Way of sage-rulers to govern the family, reflect upon my own family. If my family can harmonize their relationships, then its virtue/power overflows. By the Dao/Way of sage-rulers to govern the community, reflect upon my own neighbors. If my neighbors can trust in their friends, then its virtue/power becomes long-lasting. By the Dao/Way of sage-rulers to govern the state, reflect upon my own citizens. If my citizens can fulfill their lives, then its virtue/power becomes abundant. By the Dao/Way of sage-rulers to govern the world, reflect upon all the people in the world. If they can be without desire and without knowledge, then its virtue/power becomes universal. How do I know the world is thus? By this.*\n\n**Commentary by Hé Shàng Gōng:** *The **Laozi** says: \"How do I know the world?\" Those who cultivate the Dao/Way thrive, while those who abandon it perish. By these five stages, one observes and knows it.*\n\n**Commentary by Wáng Bì:** *This is what was spoken of above. It says: \"How do I know the world?\" Observe oneself to know it, seeking no knowledge from outside. This is the saying: \"Without leaving one’s door, one knows the world.\"*\n\n**Commentary by Wáng Yuàn Zé:** *The sage-rulers uphold one Dao/Way, with no other divergent teachings. Thus, their method of being and their method of knowing are all derived from this Dao/Way. This chapter begins by speaking of those who establish virtue/power, embrace it, and thereby know the world—these are the fundamental principles of the world itself. Those who establish virtue/power and embrace it are the cultivation of oneself. Extending this to the world, one can say it is the foundation of governance and knowledge.*\n\n---\n\n**Chapter on the Depth of Embracing Virtue/Power** (含德之厚章第五十五):\n\n**The depth of embracing virtue/power** (含德之厚)\n**is like that of an infant.**\n**Commentary of the Imperial Edict:** *Only the common people are born with thick virtue/power; as they grow, their nature changes.

When these two wúwéi harmonize, all things transform. The Sage embodies Heaven and Earth, so the people daily advance in virtue without knowing who guides them.*\n\n*Emperor Yao and Shun sat in silent repose within the Hall of Law, hands folded in repose, observing the flourishing of the people. The Duke of Zhou and Wu Wang governed without knowing or acting, yet all followed in harmony. The Emperor ruled with sleeves draped and hands folded, and the realm was governed—this is the Way of the Sage: wúwéi, yet the people transform.*\n\n*Zhuangzi says: ‘With wúwéi, all things transform.’*\n\n*I do nothing, and the people grow wealthy.*\n**River Above Master says:** *I impose no corvée labor or conscription, so the people secure in their occupations, and all grow wealthy.*\n**The *Lèi Jié* says:** *When the heart practices wúwéi and actions do nothing, the four classes take joy in their work, and the people prosper abundantly. This reverses the world’s excess of prohibitions, which only makes the people poorer.*\n\n*When the ruler does nothing, forced labor does not arise, and the people’s agricultural seasons are not disrupted—thus they grow wealthy. This further explains the meaning of ‘the people grow poorer’ from above.*\n\n*I love stillness, and the people become upright.*\n**Wang Yuanzé says:** *To love stillness is to return to one’s nature. When the ruler returns to nature, the people also return to nature, and thus become upright.*\n**This further explains the meaning of ‘thieves and bandits multiply’ from above.*\n**Yang Fu says:** *When I act, the people become perverse; when I am still, the people become upright. This reverses the harm of excessive sharp tools, which bring confusion to the state.*\n\n*I have no desires, and the people return to simplicity.*\n**Emperor Tang Minghuang says:** *With wúwéi, there is clarity and stillness, so the people transform. With no affairs, there is no disturbance, so the people grow wealthy. With love of stillness, one attains nature, so the people become upright. With no desires, harmony is preserved, so the people return to simplicity. This is the Way of taking the world without action.*\n\n*Simplicity is the preservation of nature. When my nature is whole and I have no desires, the people also have no desires and return to simplicity.*\n**This further explains the meaning of ‘strange things’ from above.*\n**This chapter advocates taking the world without action.*\n\n*From ‘the world abounds in prohibitions’ to ‘thieves and bandits multiply’—this is the error of taking the world with action. From ‘I practice wúwéi and the people transform’ to ‘I have no desires and the people return to simplicity’—this is the proof of taking the world without action.*\n\n---\n**Chapter 58: The Governance of Murky Tranquility**\n\n*When governance is murky and tranquil, the people are pure and thick.*\n**River Above Master says:** *When governance is broad and tranquil, as if unclear, the people become pure and abundant, living in mutual harmony.*\n**Emperor Tang Minghuang says:** *When governance is murky and tranquil, without action or strictness, the people respond with purity and simplicity.*\n**Lǚ Jìfǔ says:** *‘Pure and thick’ means they are not thin or sparse.*\n\n*When governance is sharp and scrutinizing, the people become depleted and exhausted.*\n**Emperor Tang Minghuang says:** *When governance is sharp and scrutinizing, with action and urgency, the people respond with depletion and decay.*\n**Prince Shū says:** *‘Murky and tranquil’ means no distinctions are made. Only when no distinctions are made can the people remain without knowledge or desire, and thus they are pure and thick. ‘Sharp and scrutinizing’ means distinctions are made. When distinctions are made, the people cannot remain without knowledge or desire, and thus they become depleted and exhausted.*\n**Lǚ Jìfǔ says:** *‘Depleted and exhausted’ means they are not fully simple.*\n\n*Disaster, yet fortune depends upon it,*\n**River Above Master says:** *‘Depends upon’ means ‘arises from.’ Disaster arises from fortune. When one encounters disaster and reflects, blaming oneself and cultivating virtue, disaster departs and fortune arrives.*\n\n*Fortune, yet disaster lurks within it.*\n**River Above Master says:** *Disaster lurks hidden within fortune. When one obtains fortune and becomes arrogant, fortune departs and disaster arrives.*\n**Emperor Tang Minghuang says:** *‘Depends upon’ means ‘arises from.’ ‘Lurks within’ means ‘is hidden in.’ Above, it is said that when governance is murky and tranquil, the people mistakenly believe there is no governance, yet they become pure and simple. This is disaster arising from fortune. When governance is sharp and scrutinizing, the people believe there is governance, yet they become depleted and exhausted—this is fortune hiding disaster.*\n\n*Where disaster and fortune depend upon and lurk within the realm of auspiciousness and inauspiciousness, where shall one reside?*\n*Indeed, when disaster comes and one is not afraid, reflecting and blaming oneself to avoid disaster—this is to dwell between disaster and fortune. If so, disaster will not come, nor will fortune arrive. Disaster and fortune will be nonexistent, and who would suffer calamity?*\n*Zhuangzi says: ‘At peace with disaster and fortune.’*\n\n*Who knows their limit?*\n**River Above Master says:** *Disaster and fortune generate each other; who can know their end?*\n**Sun Deng says:** *‘Who’ means ‘who.’ ‘Limit’ means ‘exhaustion.’ One person’s disaster and fortune interdepend, alternating without fixed pattern—disaster arises from fortune, fortune comes through disaster—who can know their exhaustion?*\n\n*There is no fixed right or wrong.*\n**Wang Yuanzé says:** *The great course does not linger in any age—this is to wish to establish the right, yet not knowing that the right cannot be constant. Then can this be called wisdom?*\n*Although it is said there is no fixed right, this is to take ‘no fixed right’ as the right. ‘Wrong’ is a doubtful phrase, yet it is also not fixed in ‘no fixed right.’*\n*The right becomes strange, the good becomes ominous, and the people’s confusion has long endured.*\n**Commentary:** *All under Heaven is but one breath. What was right yesterday may be wrong today; what was contrary before may align later. Divine and strange, fragrant and putrid—these transform into each other, beginning and ending. Thus, the strange and the right generate each other, the ominous and the good alternate. This is the natural unfolding of one breath.*\n\n*The world has existed for long—small errors change methods, great errors change nature. The customs of selfishness prevail and are not illuminated.

Great straightness aligns with principle, remaining constant; bending to follow principle. The *Book of Documents* says: \"Straightforward yet gentle, gentle so as not to harm within.\"* Straightforward yet harsh externally, not harsh so as to domineer over others—this is what is meant by *not domineering*.\nThe *Analects* says: *\"Of substance yet loving righteousness, bright yet not dazzling.\"*\n**御注:** *Straightforwardness that is domineering will domineer over others, and the faults of such behavior will manifest; brightness that dazzles will invite the calamity of flaunting one’s deeds.*\n\nTo be straight within yet yielding without, to use one’s brightness yet return to one’s clarity—this is only the Sage.\n\nWhen the people are confused, those who take *Wu Zheng* [方, \"square\"] as correct are like the *Zi Mo* [子莫] who clutches the disorder in his mouth.

This passage speaks of disaster and fortune, *Wu Zheng* and *Qi*, *Shan* and *Yao* generating each other, yet the people cannot know their confusion. Indeed, it has been long-standing—how then can they be further misled by sharp and scrutinizing governance? How can the people preserve their original purity?\n\nThus, though the Sage is square, at ease, straightforward, and bright in his own conduct, he never displays his traces to show others.

This is how Heaven becomes Heaven and humanity becomes humanity—only through *Yin* [音, \"resonance/harmony\"].\n\nTo cherish and nourish the spirit and essence, then to govern people below and serve Heaven above—hence it is said: *Governing people and serving Heaven—nothing surpasses frugality.*\n\nOnly frugality is called *early return* [早复].\n**Lü Jifu** says: *Only frugality preserves the spirit and essence without expending them, thus it is \"early return.\"* If one is not frugal and instead squanders, until the spirit is exhausted and the essence worn out, even if one wished to return to one’s original nature, there would be no way to enter it. Is this not too late?\n\nHence it is said: *Only frugality is called early return.*\n**Wang Yuanze** says: *When movement reaches its limit and stillness begins, then the return is late. Only frugality does not indulge in waste, for its departure from the root is never distant—thus, the return is early.*\n\n*Early return* is called *heavily accumulating virtue* [重积德].\n**Lü Jifu** says: *Humanity’s life is inherently sufficient through virtue.

the people have no need to exert their cleverness.’\nTheir daily lives are but eating and drinking—what harm could there be?\nThis chapter urges rulers to govern the world with the **Dao/Way**, acting without action and trusting in spontaneity, so that the subtle and manifest each dwell in their place, and humans and spirits do not interfere with one another, while **virtue/power** returns.\n\nIn the time of Emperor Yao, celestial communications ceased, and no spirits descended.\nIn the age of the Xia, mountains, rivers, and ghosts all found peace.\nThis was the **Sage** governing the world without action.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-One – Great Realms Are Like the Lower Reaches**\n\nGreat realms are like the lower reaches [of a river].\nHe Shangong says: *\"To govern a great realm, one must be like the river and sea dwelling in the lower reaches, not resisting the smallest currents.\"*\n\nWang Bi says: *\"The river and sea are vast yet dwell low, so all streams flow to them.\nA great realm is vast yet dwells low, so all under Heaven turns to it—thus, great realms are like the lower reaches.\"*\n\nLu Jifu says: *\"If one knows to govern with the **Dao/Way**, one certainly does not harm the people.\nBut if one does not know how to win the world, then even if one does not harm the people, others may harm them.\nGreat realms are like the lower reaches—the gathering place of the world.\nThe world’s gathering place is receptive, like the female.\nThe female always overcomes the male through stillness, and stillness is humility—this is the way to win the world and preserve the people.\n\nThe world’s gathering place.\nWang Bi says: *\"Where all under Heaven converges—an assembly.\"*\n\nEmperor Xuanzong of Tang says: *\"The lower reaches signify the **virtue/power** of humility.\nA great realm, by dwelling low and opening itself, invites all under Heaven to gather.\n\nThe world’s gathering place is receptive, like the female.\nWang Bi says: *\"Still and not seeking, yet all come of their own accord.\"*\n\nWang Yuanze says: *\"One should receive all with feminine stillness.*\nThe female always overcomes the male through stillness.\nHe Shangong says: *\"Yin overcomes yang by being tranquil and not seeking first.\"*\n\nStillness is humility.\nWang Bi says: *\"Because of its stillness, it can be humble.*\nThe female is the receptive.\nThe male is restless, consumed by desire; the female is always still, thus overcoming the male.\nBecause of its stillness, it can also be humble, and thus all things turn to it.\"*\n\nDuke Shū of Shu says: *\"Gathering is the assembly of the people; if one can endure what the people dislike, then all movements of the world will turn to it.\nThus it is said: ‘The world’s gathering place is receptive’—for the world’s gathering is but the gathering of the receptive.\nThe receptive always overcomes the active through stillness, and stillness is humility—thus, stillness is the ruler, and always dwelling low, it is sufficient to overcome the active.\nThus it is said: ‘With stillness, it overcomes the active; with stillness, it is humble.’\n\nLu Jifu says: *\"The world’s gathering place is receptive, and the receptive always overcomes the active through stillness—yet what allows it to overcome is its humility through stillness.\nThus, great realms, by dwelling low over small realms, take the small realms.\nWang Bi says: *\"‘Great realms dwell low’—meaning even great realms dwell low over small realms, and the small realms attach to them.\"*",

      "translated_text": "「Emperor Tang Minghuang said: *\"For\"* means to labor and contrive. *\"Execute\"* means to cling and fixate.\nHe spoke of how people cannot act before things arise nor govern before chaos ensues,\nyet instead contrive labor beyond their natural inclinations and fixate upon the dusty realms of the world,\nthus inevitably inviting calamity and suffering loss.\n\n Lü Jifu said: To act before things arise is to not truly act in accordance with *for*.\n To govern before chaos ensues is to not truly govern in accordance with *treat*.\n Once things exist and one acts upon them, desiring their completion only to bring about their ruin.\n Once disorder has arisen and one governs it, clinging to it only to lose it in the end.\n\n Therefore, the Sage does nothing and thus meets no defeat,\n holds nothing and thus suffers no loss.\n\n *Imperial Commentary*: The Sage does not engage in worldly affairs,\n thus meets no defeat. He does not cling to anything as his own,\n thus suffers no loss. The more one deviates from the Dao/Way,\n the farther one strays from its rules. Can one truly avoid ruin and loss?\n\n Lü Jifu said: Thus, the Sage acts before things arise,\n yet does so through *non-action* (*wúwéi*), and so meets no defeat.\n Governs before chaos ensues,\n yet does so through *non-execution* (*wúzhí*), and so suffers no loss.\n The common folk, in their pursuits,\n often reach near completion only to meet ruin.\n\n *Imperial Commentary*: To halt midway, abandon halfway through, or begin with vigor only to end in slackness—\n these are the ways of the common folk, and none can escape them.\n Thus, their affairs often reach near completion only to fail.\n Lü Jifu said: The common folk, in their pursuits,\n act only after things have already arisen,\n thus reaching near completion only to meet ruin—\n for they do not know their fundamental nature.\n\n When the common folk reach near completion yet fail,\n it is because they do not heed their final steps.\n The *Book of Documents* says: *\"To build a mountain nine *rèn* high,\n yet fail by one basket’s worth of earth.\"*\n To be as careful at the end as at the beginning,\n then there will be no ruined affairs.\n\n *Imperial Commentary*: Few can maintain their beginning to the end.\n To renew each moment as the start,\n applying this to affairs—\n what is there that cannot be accomplished?\n\n Emperor Tang Minghuang said: If one is vigilant in the final stages,\n ever preserving the mind of goodness from the start,\n then there will surely be no calamity or ruin.\n\n Lü Jifu said: If one knows that greatness arises from smallness,\n height from lowliness, and distance from proximity,\n and remains as careful at the end as at the beginning—\n how could there be any ruined affairs?\n\n Therefore, the Sage desires without desiring,\n does not prize goods that are hard to obtain,\n studies without studying,\n and corrects the errors of the common folk.\n\n *Imperial Commentary*: Those who seek profit exchange their nature for material things,\n and those who study diligently drown their hearts in trivial pursuits.\n How could this ever approach *non-action*?\n\n The Sage does not burden his form with profit,\n desiring only in *non-desire* (*bùyù*).\n Nurturing both self and others is complete when stopped,\n thus he does not prize goods that are hard to obtain.\n He does not extinguish the heavenly in himself for worldly gain,\n studying only in *non-study* (*bùxué*—\n cultivating brightness and harmony without contrivance),\n thus correcting the errors of the common folk.\n\n When the Dao/Way is not illuminated,\n even the worthy err in it—\n how much more so the common folk?\n To correct their errors and return them to their true nature—\n this is how scholars without worries find joy.\n\n Lü Zhi said: To discard gold as though it were mountain soil,\n to cast pearls into the abyss,\n to abandon the treasures of *extreme authenticity* (*jízhēn*),\n to sever the tools of exhausting skill (*qióngqiǎo*),\n this is what is meant by *desiring without desiring*.\n To forget about benevolence and righteousness,\n to abandon ritual and music,\n to cast aside the stale dregs of old teachings,\n to throw away the rotten husks of false doctrine—\n this is what is meant by *studying without studying*.\n\n Wang Yuanzé said: *Desiring without desiring* is not the absence of desire,\n but desire lies in *non-desire*—\n thus he does not prize goods that are hard to obtain.\n When the people have food to eat and warm clothing,\n these are necessities of their nature—\n to desire no more than this is not to have desire,\n yet after satisfying these needs, to further covet hard-to-obtain goods—\n this is the delusion of the foolish masses,\n straying far from their fundamental nature.\n\n Therefore, the Sage desires without desiring,\n to rescue them from their delusion and return them to their true nature.\n *Studying without studying* is not the absence of learning,\n but what is learned lies in *non-study*—\n to correct the errors of the common folk.\n\n The common folk chase trivial ends and engage in endless affairs,\n while the Sage, through *non-study* that corrects their errors,\n returns them to the Dao/Way.\n To assist the natural unfolding of all things,\n yet dare not to act.\n\n Lu Yu said: *Assist* means *aid*.\n Man is born in stillness—\n this is the nature of things.\n With *non-desire* and *non-study*,\n aiding the natural unfolding of all things,\n letting each fulfill its nature,\n yet daring not to act—\n what is there to do?\n It does not disrupt their inherent order,\n nor go against their natural inclinations.\n To aid their arising when they arise,\n to aid their form when they take shape—\n this is how the officials of *You* (有虞) managed affairs,\n and how the virtuous power of *Xia* (有夏) brought harmony to birds, beasts, fish, and tortoises.\n\n This passage speaks of how the Sage addresses difficulty in its ease.\n Thus, he holds fast in times of tranquility—\n this is what is meant by *acting before things arise*.\n He establishes order in moments of fragility—\n this is what is meant by *governing before chaos ensues*.」",

      "translated_text": "«Take three matters as analogies. If one seeks to forestall future hardship by acting early, one must act without interference and without grasping—then all will be well. The Sage does not wish to still the people with *non-action* (无为) or to cut off learning with *non-study* (无忧), but rather to assist all things in their natural unfolding, thus embodying the Dao of *non-action*. Only then can one maintain ease in tranquility and avoid the burden of future difficulty.\n\nThe ancient masters who excelled in the Way did not seek to enlighten the people, but rather to keep them simple. *Commentary*: The people can be guided, but cannot be made to know.\n\nThe ancient masters who excelled in the Way merely led them.\n\nTo reverse their natural inclinations, the Way can be carried out, yet when one acts with them, no cleverness or artifice is needed.\n\nThus it is said: To keep the Three Dynasties and those below in simplicity, to release the unadorned *non-action* (恬惔无为), and to delight in the harmonious and plain (咛哼之意), bending and folding ritual and music to rectify the forms of the world, sighing and breathing forth virtue and righteousness to soothe the hearts of the people—this was done to enlighten them.\n\nThough called *governance* (治之), what greater chaos could there be?\n\nWang Bi said: *Enlightenment* (明) means excessive perception and craftiness, dispersing their simplicity.\n\n*Simplicity* (愚) means having no knowledge to guard, following nature.\n\nWen Gong said: To remove ornamentation and pursue reality, to return to purity and simplicity.\n\nCao Dao Chong said: When the people are clever, deceit arises; when the people are simple, they return to purity.\n\nThe enlightened one enlights the people with his cleverness, but not to enlighten them—that is what is meant by *not governing the state with cleverness*.\n\n*Simplicity* is the opposite of cleverness; one seeks to keep the people simple, making them abandon cleverness and return to purity, forgetting distinctions, severing good and evil, and aligning with the state of *no knowledge, no desire*.\n\nThe difficulty of governing the people lies in their cleverness being too great.\n\nShu Wang said: The Sage’s cleverness is a state’s beneficial tool.\n\nThe ancient masters who excelled in the Way did not display their Sage’s cleverness to the people, but rather sought to keep them simple, without knowledge or desire.\n\nThus, Zhuangzi said: If the ruler truly loves cleverness yet lacks the Way, then the world will fall into great disorder.\n\nHow do we know this to be true? The more cunning the bows, crossbows, and snares are, the more the birds are disordered above. The more intricate the hooks, baits, nets, and traps, the more the fish are disordered in the water. The more refined the fences, enclosures, and traps, the more the beasts are disordered in the marshes. The more varied the clever distinctions of *allowing, gradual, poisonous, slippery, firm, white, resolving filth, and harmonizing differences*, the more the people are bewildered by sophistry.\n\nThus, the world often falls into great disorder, and the blame lies with the love of cleverness. Cleverness leads to deceit; simplicity leads to no knowledge. When the people are filled with clever deceit, cunning and falsehood flourish, making governance difficult.\n\nThus, governing the state with cleverness is the state’s ruin.\n\nLu Yu said: To uphold the Way and employ cleverness is to give rise to great falsehood.\n\nFalsehood arises from below, cleverness from above; when the two deceive each other, the harm is great.\n\nTang Ming Huang said: *With* (以) means *to use*; *ruin* (贼) means *harm*. When a ruler employs clever ministers to govern the state, cleverness must inevitably produce laws. Laws bring forth deceit, and orders give rise to cunning, which is why the state grows increasingly corrupt and cleverness becomes the state’s ruin.\n\nCao Can guarded the law, yet the Han prospered through him; Shang Jun altered the law, yet Qin declined through him. Thus, the *Classic* above says: *When cleverness and wisdom arise, great falsehood follows*—this is the case.\n\nSu Zi You said: I govern others with my cleverness; they also respond with their cleverness. Thus, the ruler and people deceive each other, and the harm is great.\n\nNot governing the state with cleverness is the state’s blessing.\n\nTang Ming Huang said: If one does not employ clever ministers but instead takes pure-virtued officials, who can rest and flourish, manage affairs and resolve difficulties naturally, then clever deceit will grow thin and simplicity will flourish. When the people are harmonious, the years will be bountiful—this is why it is the state’s blessing.\n\nLiu Zhong Ping said: Not governing the state with cleverness is to *open the heavens* (开天); governing the state with cleverness is to *open the people* (开人). To open the heavens is to follow, and following means to act in what requires no effort—this is why their governance is not strict yet effective. To open the people is to pierce, and piercing means to lose oneself in excessive scrutiny—this is why their people are not simple but deficient.\n\nThus it is said: Governing the state with cleverness is the state’s ruin; not governing the state with cleverness is the state’s blessing.\n\nThe *New Sayings* say: Yao and Shun’s cleverness lay in not restricting things; Yu’s cleverness lay in acting in what required no effort. Not restricting things means not scrutinizing them to claim enlightenment; acting in what requires no effort means not piercing them to claim utility—this is truly to excel in the use of cleverness.\n\nIf we speak of the Laozi’s *not governing the state with cleverness*, it lies in preserving it, and then the people will benefit a hundredfold.\n\nUnderstanding these two principles is also the *standard model* (楷式).\n\nHe Shang Gong said: The two principles refer to cleverness and the lack of cleverness.\n\nThose who always know cleverness are the ruin; those who lack cleverness are the blessing.\n\nThis is the standard model for governing oneself and the state.\n\nTang Ming Huang said: To employ clever deceit harms the people; to employ pure virtue blesses the state. When a ruler understands these two principles, he entrusts pure-virtued officials—this is the standard model for being a ruler.\n\nLu Ji Fu said: Understanding these two principles is not just for governing the state, but also serves as a standard model for oneself, and it is never violated.\n\nAlways knowing the standard model is called *Mysterious Virtue* (玄德).\n\nHe Shang Gong said: *Mysterious* (玄) is the *heavenly* (天). To always know the standard model for governing oneself and the state is to align with the virtue of heaven.\n\nTang Ming Huang said: *Mysterious* (玄) means *deep* (深) and *wondrous* (妙). When a ruler always knows whom to entrust, this is called the deep, far-reaching, wondrous, and supreme virtue.\n\nMysterious Virtue is deep and far-reaching, opposing all things—\n\n*Commentary*: *Mysterious* (玄) is the color of heaven. To always know the standard model yet not use cleverness is to align with heaven’s virtue, deep beyond measure, far beyond reach, standing alone above all things, so that no thing can couple with it. Thus it is said: *It opposes all things.*»",

grow weary of him.\nIt is through lowliness and yielding\nthat one is able to be the sovereign of all the valleys.\nThe sovereign is the one to whom all things return.\nIf one yields, the people will

daring to treat the enemy lightly,\nfor fear of losing one’s treasure.\nHence, when armies clash,\nthe one who shows compassion and mercy will prevail.\n\nMy words are easy to understand, easy to follow.\nYet none in the world can understand, none can follow.\nThe imperial commentary states:\n*The Dao is bright and easily seen,\nso when spoken of, it is easy to understand.*\nIt is simple yet easy to uphold,\nso when encountered, it is easy to follow.\nMencius said:\n*The Dao is like a broad road—\nyet how could it be difficult to know?*\nThus, the Dao has no difficulty,\nyet the world has none who cannot find it difficult—\nthose who cannot,\nsimply do not seek it within themselves.\nSu Ziyou said:\n*The greatness of the Dao lies in restoring one’s nature—\nand this is enough.*\nThe wondrous applications of nature\nare seen in one’s daily actions and meals.\nThe sage points to this and shows it to others—\nis it not easy to understand?\nIf one can embody this to respond to things—\nis it not easy to follow?\nYet the world often suffers from knowing yet not recognizing,\nand even knowing, cannot follow—\nhow much less can it follow?\n\nEasy to understand, easy to follow—\nbecause of its utmost simplicity.\nIt cannot be grasped by mere thought or reasoning,\nso it is called *‘not thinking yet knowing.’*\nBecause of its utmost proximity,\nit cannot be reached by slow or hasty steps,\nso it is called *‘not walking yet arriving.’*\nUsing intelligence to know it,\none’s understanding will be shallow—\nthus, none in the world can truly know it.\nUsing force to

difficulty.\nWords take *non-speech* as their root;\naffairs take *non-action* as their lord.\nObtaining the root makes understanding easy,\nrecognizing the lord makes action easy.\nThose in the world who cannot understand or cannot follow,\nsimply do not know their root or their lord.\nOnly those without knowledge,\nare why they do not know me.\n\nWang Bi said:\n*‘Being clothed in coarse sackcloth yet holding jade within’*—\nclothing in coarse sackcloth means blending with the common,\nholding jade within means treasuring one’s true essence.\nThe sage is difficult to know,\nbecause they blend with the common yet do not stand out,\nhold jade within yet do not display it—\nthus, they are difficult to know and yet noble.\nCoarse sackcloth is the garment of the vulgar,\njade is the precious treasure.\nClothing in coarse sackcloth means appearing crude externally,\nharmonizing one’s light with the dust,\nacting as if foolish or dim-witted,\nnot differing from the common.\nHolding jade within means concealing treasure inwardly,\nembracing the Dao and nurturing virtue,\nhiding one’s name and reputation,\nnot revealing oneself to others.\nThis differs from the vulgar crowd who flaunt jade on their sleeves.\nZhuangzi said:\n*The sage holds it within themselves,\nwhile the common people debate to show it to others.*\nThis chapter states that the Dao is easy to know and easy to follow,\nyet none in the world can know or follow it—\nbecause words have a root and affairs have a lord.\nOnly those who have the root and lord,\nare why the knowing ones are few.\nThe sage is difficult to know,\nbecause they treasure this Dao and wear coarse sackcloth.\n\n**Chapter Seventy-One: Knowing the Unknown**\nKnowing the unknown is supreme.\nNot knowing yet claiming to know is an affliction.\n\nLǚ Jìfǔ said:\n*The essence of the Dao is\nto know without knowing yet be able to know.*\nTo recognize one’s own ignorance,\nand yet know through that ignorance—\nthis is the highest attainment.\nThus it is said: *‘Knowing the unknown is supreme.’*\nThough one recognizes their ignorance,\nyet insists on knowing through knowledge—\ntheir mind is mediocre and unpeaceful.\nThus it is said: *‘Not knowing yet claiming to know is an affliction.’*\n\nWen Gong said:\n*‘Knowing yet acting as if one does not know,\nkeeps one distant from blame.’*\n*‘Not knowing yet insisting on knowing,\ninvites disaster.’*\nOnly by recognizing the affliction of affliction,\ndoes one avoid affliction.\nTang Minghuang said:\n*‘Only by recognizing the affliction of insisting on knowing,\ndoes

Bold without daring treats the necessary as unnecessary, thus wields no arms and lives.\n\nLǚ Jìfǔ said: Those who wield their strength and fixate on externals are bold in daring—these are the doomed. Thus it is said: *Bold in daring leads to death.*\n\nThose who govern with gentleness and fixate on nothing are bold without daring—these are the living. Thus it is said: *Bold without daring brings life.*\n\nThese two paths—one brings benefit, one harm.\nHé Shànggōng said: The two refer to daring and not daring. Preserving life is benefit; destroying life is harm.\n\nWang Bì said: Both are forms of courage, yet their applications differ—thus benefit and harm arise. Hence it is said: *One brings benefit, one harm.*\n\nLǚ Jìfǔ said: Bold in daring may seem beneficial, yet harm lies within. Bold without daring may seem harmful, yet benefit lies within. What Heaven abhors, who knows its reason?\n\nOfficial Commentary: Those who deviate from humanity align with Heaven. What benefits humanity, Heaven abhors—who can know its source? Thus even the Sage finds it difficult.\n\nOfficial Commentary: Those who follow Heaven endure; those who defy it perish—even the Sage dares not alter this.\n\nThe Way of Heaven does not contend yet triumphs well.\nOfficial Commentary: All things emerge, and Heaven emerges with them without resistance. All things return, and Heaven receives them without obstruction—this is called not contending. Ebb and flow, fullness and emptiness, accompany all things, yet all their abundance comes from received fate—this is called not contending yet triumphing well.\n\nTáng Mínghuáng said: Below, it speaks of Heaven’s humility and emptiness, admonishing human boldness. Heaven does not contend with things; the four seasons wax and wane without resistance—thus it triumphs well.\n\nIt does not speak yet responds well.\nWáng Yuānzé said: How does Heaven speak? The seasons move, myriad things flourish, rewarding virtue and punishing licentiousness—all changes respond without a word.\n\nLiú Rénhuì said: Silent and still, thus it is called ‘not speaking.’ Yet when moved, it responds—thus it is called ‘responds well.’\n\nIt is not summoned yet comes.\nOfficial Commentary: Those who receive fate can summon it, yet Heaven governs all things’ fates—who can summon them? It simply follows the natural course of *qi*.\n\nIt moves with effortless ease, yet plans with consummate skill.\nCài Zǐhuǎng said: Though vast and unconstrained, it plans with precision—good and evil differ not by a hair.\n\nWáng Yuānzé said: Ever easy, thus unconstrained; knowing peril, thus plans well.\n\nHeaven’s net is vast, sparse yet nothing escapes.\nOfficial Commentary: Dense yet with gaps—this is human artifice. Heaven, though sparse, has no gaps. Accumulated virtue and vice bring retribution in kind—thus nothing is lost. Yet only through contention does one triumph, only through speech does one respond—this is humanity. Heaven does not contend yet triumphs well, does not speak yet responds well. Summoned, it arrives; yet to know Heaven is difficult for humanity. Heaven arrives unsummoned, unconstrained yet plans well.\n\nOnly the Sage can embody this, thus does not seek benefit nor shun harm—always benefiting, never harming—thus aligning with Heaven’s virtue, differing from those bold in daring.\n\nCáo Dàochōng said: Nothing escapes Heaven’s net—vast yet encompassing all. Though sparse, nothing slips through. Encompassing all six directions, no thing escapes within—this is Heaven’s net. *Héihéi*—vast indeed. Though seemingly sparse, rewards and punishments differ not by a hair.\n\nThis chapter speaks of bold daring and not daring. Bold daring is what Heaven abhors—even the Sage finds it difficult. Below, it speaks of Heaven’s humility and emptiness, urging it as a model. The people do not commonly fear death—\n\n**Chapter 74: The People Do Not Commonly Fear Death**\n\n*The people do not commonly fear death—how then can you frighten them with death?*\n\nMetuan said: *Nàihé*—how, as in ‘how can this be?’ When Dao and virtue decay, punishments grow harsh and cruel, then life is not cherished, death not feared. People do not fear death because governance is oppressive. If they do not revere great virtue in life, yet you impose severe punishments to instill fear, the people will defy laws and never reform.\n\nLuxury and licentiousness drain the vital essence and *qi*, causing the spirits to scatter—driven to perilous acts that shock the soul. When the ruler loses the Way, the people lack constancy, defying laws—what is there to fear in death? Yet the ruler still threatens death, using saws and axes, ropes and measuring lines, yet chaos never ceases—this is the case of Qin and after.\n\nIf the people commonly feared death, and acted strangely, I would seize and kill them—who would dare?\"*",

The Southern Palace’s Golden Register rewards virtue and oversees life, while the Northern Palace’s Black Ledger records offenses and governs death. Heaven and Earth, along with the myriad spirits, oversee and judge good and evil, using them to admonish and encourage, so that evil may be abandoned and virtue cultivated. Thus, those with merit extend their years, while the guilty have their fate diminished—no fraction is lost, as in the meticulous reckoning of the Yang Palace. Heaven has the Four Official Stars of Destiny, located between Xu and Wei, beside the Human Star, overseeing humanity. These Four Official Stars are what the *Three Elements Scripture* calls ‘Heaven’s agents of execution.’*\n\n*\"To substitute as the agent of execution is to usurp the Great Carpenter’s axe.

River Master said: ‘When a ruler enforces punishments, it is like a clumsy man substituting for the Great Carpenter in hewing wood—squares and circles will never align, and he will inevitably harm himself.

To usurp the agents of execution is to usurp the Great Carpenter’s axe—rarely does one avoid injuring their own hands.

      "translated_text": "「Thus, the people’s hunger arises from the excessive taxes and levies imposed by their rulers—hence their hunger. *The Imperial Commentary* states: Heavy taxation leads to widespread barrenness of fields and crops, and the people lack sufficient food.\n\n Lü Jiufu remarks: If one man’s labor can feed several households, why should there ever be hunger? Yet when hunger does arise, is it not precisely because of the excessive taxes and levies demanded by their rulers?\n\n Wang Yuanzhe asserts: If one establishes official salaries and implements the rites of taxation properly, it would be to enrich the people. But when expenditures grow lavish while the foundations of governance weaken, and taxes multiply while essentials decline, the result is merely that the people starve.\n\n The Duke of Zhou imposed heavy taxes, leading to the rise of Chu. *The Book of Songs* composed the *Huge Rat* ode to censure the Duke of Wei for his oppressive taxation.\n\n The difficulty of governing the people stems from the rulers’ excessive interventions—hence their difficulty in being governed. *The Imperial Commentary* states: When governance is intricate, deceit and falsehood flourish, and the people lose their simplicity.\n\n Liu Jinxi notes: Excessive intervention makes governance cumbersome; non-intervention simplifies affairs. Simplicity is easy to follow, while intricacy is hard to govern.\n\n The six passions are hard to control because of the rulers’ excessive interventions. Lü Jiufu says: Weaving yields clothing, tilling yields food—this is called harmonizing virtue. Why should governing be difficult? Yet when governance becomes difficult, is it not because of the rulers’ excessive interventions?\n\n Wang Yuanzhe states: If one entrusts discerning officials to manage affairs, it would be to govern the people. But when men are burdened by customs and refined by worldly influence, craftiness and deceit proliferate, making governance even harder. Observing the ancient past and later ages confirms this truth.\n\n Shun governed through non-intervention, enabling his rule as Emperor. Wu governed with relaxed oversight, securing his reign as King. The rise and flourishing of emperors and kings all originate from this principle.\n\n *The Scripture* says: To govern through non-action is to ensure nothing remains ungoverned.\n\n The people’s disregard for death stems from their excessive pursuit of life—hence their lightness toward death. *Zuan Wei* explains: Heavy taxation and cumbersome governance strip the people of their livelihoods, driving them to compete for treasures and risk laws and prohibitions. They court death recklessly because their pursuit of means to sustain life is too fervent, leading to those who fear neither drowning nor burning, nor wielding blades.\n\n Lü Jiufu says: If their food is sweet, their clothing fine, their dwellings secure, and their customs joyful, why should they ever regard death lightly? Yet when they do regard death lightly, is it not because their pursuit of life’s sustenance is too fervent?\n\n Wen Gong observes: The pursuit of profit is meant to nourish life, yet the people often lose their lives through profit. Overvaluing life while greedily seeking profit inevitably leads to courting danger, and thus they view death lightly.\n\n Only those who do not cling to life for its own sake are wiser than those who prize it. *The Imperial Commentary* cites *Zhuangzi*: \"Those who understand the nature of life do not strive for what life cannot provide.\" Not clinging to life means abandoning what life cannot provide. To forsake worldly affairs and relinquish life’s burdens is the way. When one’s form is unlabored and essence unexhausted, form preserved and essence restored, one aligns with Heaven—this is wiser than merely prizing life.\n\n Prizing life differs from regarding death lightly; relinquishing life’s burdens is wiser than merely prizing it. Extending the principles that benefit one’s own life to the people would result in light taxation and few punishments, ensuring households are well-provided and people are content, while distinct clothing and customs would prevent transgressions. This is the ultimate achievement of emperors and kings.\n\n This chapter speaks of heavy taxation and cumbersome governance, which strip the people of their livelihoods, leading them to regard death lightly. These three issues all harm the essentials while neglecting the foundations. Prizing life differs from regarding death lightly, while not clinging to life’s burdens is wiser than merely prizing it.\n\n---\n*Chapter Seventy-Six: On the Nature of Life and Death*\n\nThe nature of human life is soft and weak, while death brings rigidity and strength. *He Shang Gong* says: In life, humans contain harmonious *qi* and embrace spirit, hence their softness and weakness. In death, harmonious *qi* is exhausted and spirit departs, hence their rigidity and strength.\n\n All things, grasses, and trees are soft and pliable in life—*He Shang Gong* says: Because harmonious *qi* remains. In death, they wither and decay—*He Shang Gong* says: Because harmonious *qi* disperses.\n\n Yan Zun explains: Where *yang qi* resides, trees can be bent and grasses can be tied. Where *yang qi* departs, water can solidify and ice can break. Thus, rigidity and strength belong to death, while softness and weakness belong to life.\n\n *He Shang Gong* says: By observing these two phenomena, one knows that rigidity and strength signify death, while softness and weakness signify life.\n\n Emperor Ming of the Tang dynasty remarked: It is clear that those who preserve their softness and weakness remain alive and long-lived, while those who grow rigid and overbearing perish and lose their nature.\n\n Lü Jiufu says: *The Dao* is a thing without form yet not contentious. Thus, it is the most soft and weak in the world, yet none comprehend it. Hence, to illustrate it with things of form: The nature of human life is soft and weak, while death brings rigidity and strength. Grasses and trees are soft and pliable in life, but wither and decay in death. Even though these things have form, they die through rigidity and strength, and live through softness and weakness—how much more so the Dao, which has no form, yet does not lead to softness and weakness! It is impossible to attain.\n\n Therefore, when armies grow strong, they cannot prevail—*The Imperial Commentary* states: When opposing armies clash, the sorrowful will triumph.\n\n Wang Zhen notes: The remnants of Xia and Shang, with armies numbering in the hundreds of thousands, overthrew the four seas. Yet at the end of Qin Shi Huang’s reign, despite his unified empire, he lost all nine regions. Xiang Yu rose to power swiftly and perished just as quickly. Wang Mang usurped the throne and was destroyed soon after. Fu Jian was defeated in humiliation at the Huai River; Emperor Yang of the Sui dynasty collapsed in splendor at the Chu Palace. These numerous dynasties all fielded armies of tens of millions, or even hundreds of millions, yet none failed to rely on their strength, only to meet defeat—this is all evidence that when armies grow strong, they cannot prevail.\n\n Armies that rely on their strength inevitably become arrogant and haughty. Arrogance and haughtiness are the paths to ruin and annihilation. Qin Shi Huang was at his strongest, yet his dynasty did not last two generations before collapsing. The Xiang family’s sudden rise to power was swiftly followed by extinction.

      "translated_text": "**严遵** said: The artisan who crafts a bow neither overbends nor underbends it, neither slackens nor over-tightens it. He shapes it by the compass and plumb-line, ensuring strict alignment. If the string is too taut and high, he relaxes and lowers it; if the string is too slack and low, he tightens and raises it. Where there is excess, he carves away to diminish it; where there is deficiency, he fills and supplements it. The string and the bow’s body balance each other—upper and lower in harmony—with evenness as the principle and attunement as the norm. Thus, the bow may be struck, and the arrow may fly true.\n\nThe principle of pressing down the high and raising the low, diminishing the excessive and supplementing the deficient—this is the Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth.\n\n**Zhang Junxiang** said: The art of using a bow lies in this: the high must be feared for excess, so it is pressed down lest it rise too far. The low must be feared for insufficiency, so it is raised lest it fall too low. Neither too high nor too low—this is the mean, the measure of perfection. In governance, too, one must seek this equilibrium: excessive height invites rejection, while harming the low invites censure. Pressing down the high and raising the low—this aligns with the natural order.\n\n**Emperor Xuanzong of Tang** said: Only when the bow is thus attuned can one strike true. This is like the Dao/Way of Heaven, which diminishes excess and supplements deficiency, teaching rulers to emulate Heaven’s *de* [virtue/power] and govern humanity accordingly—hence the principle of pressing down the high and raising the low.\n\nThe Dao/Way of Heaven diminishes excess and supplements deficiency.\n*The Imperial Commentary* notes: *\"Fullness invites loss; humility invites benefit—this is the Dao/Way of time.\"* But the Dao/Way of humanity is reversed: the deficient are sacrificed to serve the excessive.\n*The Imperial Commentary* notes: Human nature elevates the low to oppress the high, favors the few while fearing the eminent.\n\n**Wang Yuanzai** said: Human governance follows inclination, thus it is unequal.\n\n**He Shangong** said: The Dao/Way of humanity is contrary to that of Heaven. Common folk diminish the poor to enrich the rich, plunder the weak to empower the strong. Who, then, can use their excess to nourish the world, but the sage alone?\n*The Imperial Commentary* notes: Only the sage does not oppress the few while exhausting the many, nor does he fear the eminent while depriving the generous. Only the sage can do this.\n\n**He Shangong** said: Who can occupy a position of excess, yet voluntarily reduce their rank and wealth to nourish those in want? Only the sage-ruler can act thus.\n\n**Wang Yuanzai** said: The sage harmonizes with the Dao/Way of Heaven. Therefore, the sage acts without claiming merit, achieves without taking credit, and does not seek to display virtue.\n\n**Luóshī** said: Having attained this emptiness and openness, free from thought and deliberation, how could one’s mind and intellect desire to exalt their own wisdom and ability?

There is no substitute for it.\n\n**Lǚ Jífǔ** said: Among all things in the world, only water can conform to the curves and straightness, angles and roundness of objects, flowing with them. Thus, nothing is as soft and weak as water. Yet it can carry great vessels, turn massive stones, pierce steep cliffs and valleys, and float and bear all things under Heaven—only water can do this. Hence, nothing can surpass it in overcoming hardness and strength. This is so because, though it twists and changes in myriad ways, it never loses its essence as water. This is why there is no substitute for it. Water adapts to all things yet never alters itself, for its softness and weakness. If people can embody this, though they face countless transformations, their minds remain steadfast and unchanging. Thus, they can overcome all things without harm.\n\nTherefore, the soft overcomes the hard, the weak overcomes the strong. All under Heaven know this, yet none can practice it.\n\n**Hé Shànggōng** said: The tongue is soft, the teeth are hard, yet the teeth perish before the tongue.

Thus, the world attains balance. If one does not follow this path, grievances will only multiply. Yet people still strive to harmonize them endlessly.\n\nThus it is said: To harmonize great grievances will inevitably leave lingering grievances.\n\n*\"The unvirtuous, I too treat with virtue\"*—this is how one cultivates true virtue.\n\nTo harmonize great grievances yet still leave lingering grievances—how then can it be called good?\n\nA ruler cannot avoid action, yet if he is humble, yielding, and soft, the people will grow greedy and quarrelsome, and grievances and hatreds will flourish.\n\nIf the ruler enacts laws to restrain them—those who kill are put to death, those who injure are punished—yet if he harmonizes and repays their grievances, how can deceit grow worse and hatreds multiply? How then can it be called good?\n\nThus, the Sage holds the **left contract**.\n\n**Hé Shànggōng** said: In ancient times, the Sage held the left contract, using inscribed tablets and matching seals as proof.\n\nWithout written laws or statutes, they carved contracts and matching seals to establish trust.\n\n**Lü Xisheng** said: In ancient times, they tied knots to make agreements, and the people did not deceive. They split wood into contracts, and the people did not violate them. Why? Because the Sage had no fixed intentions—he took the people’s hearts as his own.\n\nThus, the Sage’s heart and the people’s hearts were like left and right contracts. When the contract came, they aligned without blame, so ruler and subjects grew close, and grievances did not arise.\n\n**Li Rong** said: In ancient times, the Sage carved wooden contracts—the ruler held the left, the subject the right—as proof, sealing them with matching seals. They did not rely on laws or statutes, imposing no penalties on things, hence *\"without blaming others.\"*\n\nThus, without punishment or blame, what grievances could there be to harmonize?\n\n**Wang Bi** said: The left contract prevents the origin of grievances, yet does not blame others.\n\n**Lü Jifu** said: Thus, the Sage holds the left contract without blaming others—this is how those who seek vengeance do not break their spears, though they harbor resentment, they do not blame the wind and tiles, and the world attains balance through this path.\n\nIndeed, in ancient times, those who offered oxen and horses held the right contract—the right contract was for taking, the left for giving. Thus, the left contract was always given to others, never held as possession.\n\nThe Sage acts yet does not rely on it; when his work is done, he does not claim it. He always gives in abundance to the world. Even when killing, he lets officials execute, yet never takes personal responsibility—this is holding the left contract, giving to others without possession, the way of having no grievances and not blaming others.\n\nIs this not because harmony is not a source of joy?\n\n**Wang Yuanzhe** said: The left contract takes from others; the right contract takes from people. The left is without action, the right holds authority—thus the ancient division of contracts was so.\n\nThe Sage holds the left contract, not interfering in things, yet things come to align with him. He responds to their alignment—this is called *\"responding and thus communicating with all under Heaven.\"*\n\nThen, the Sage always bears the world’s blame yet harbors no blame toward others—thus, he remains without grievance.\n\n**Zhuangzi** said: *\"To gain is attributed to others; to lose is attributed to oneself.\"* **Tang** said: *\"All under Heaven have faults; the fault lies with me.\"* This is what is meant.\n\n*The Records* say: Those who offered oxen and horses held the right token—clearly, the offering party presented both tokens together, so the left token was held by the one bearing responsibility.\n\n*The Historical Records* say: The right contract was used to demand accountability.\n\nThus, the virtuous hold the contracts;\n\n**Wang Yuanzhe** said: Not interfering in things, yet responding to their alignment.\n\n**Yan Xian** said: Seeking within oneself.\n\nA virtuous ruler oversees the contracts and trust, preventing grievances from arising, and only then does he blame others.\n\nThe unvirtuous oversee **through** (彻).\n\n**Hé Shànggōng** said: The unvirtuous ruler betrays his contracts and trust, overseeing others’ failures.\n\n**Yan Xian** said: Seeking without.\n\n**Shu Wang** said: If one oversees *through* (彻) to the end of matters, he cannot avoid blaming others.

Though the people are many, they are treated as if few—so no one dares to burden them.\n\n**Zang Xuanjing** said: A state with little land is a small state. A people with few soldiers is few people.\n\n**Wang Yuanzhe** said: In a small state with few people, the populace is pure and honest. But in a great state with many people, interests and harms clash, and crafty deceits arise. Observe the people in the capital and those in the rural settlements—their manners differ starkly between guile and sincerity. Thus, a small state means simple governance, and few people mean honest folk. Simple governance and honest folk can restore the administration of the Great Ancients.\n\nThough there are implements for every ten or hundred households, they are not used.\n**Duke Shou of Shu** said: If the people are few, then my needs are also narrow. Thus, in a small state with few people, even if there are implements for every ten or hundred households, they are not used.\n\n**Wang Yuanzhe** said: Implements shared by ten households are called *shí* instruments. Implements shared by a hundred households are called *bǎi* instruments. Under the governance of simplicity and stillness, the aim is to let the people fulfill their natural inclinations without needless labor or contrivance, so there will never be matters of collective migration or warfare. Hence, though implements exist for every ten or hundred households, they are not used.\n\nLet the people value death and not seek distant resettlement.\n**River Master** said: If a ruler can create benefits and remove harms for the people, ensuring each finds their proper place, then the people will value death over life and cherish their existence. If governance and commands are not burdensome, the people will be content with their occupations and thus will not seek distant resettlement, abandoning their familiar dwellings.\n\n**Wang Yuanzhe** said: Those who find joy in life and fulfill their nature will value death. Those who are at peace with their land and have no desires will not seek distant resettlement. Those who value death do not lightly regard life. Those who share life with others but do not value their own existence are different. Those who do not seek distant resettlement are at peace in their homes. Those who scatter among the myriad people and are not at peace in their homes are different.\n\nThough there are boats and carriages, they have no need to ride them.\nThough there are armor and weapons, they have no need to display them.\n**Commentary:** There are no urgent journeys across perilous terrain, so though boats and carriages exist, they are not used. There are no battles to be fought, so though armor and weapons exist, they are not displayed.\n\n**Zanwei** said: Hollowing wood makes boats, to ferry across water; carving wheels makes carriages, to traverse land. These are for distant travel. In an age of non-action, mountains have no paths or tunnels, marshes have no boats or bridges—since travel is already severed, what need for riding or display?\n\n**Zhang Junxiang** said: Weapons are used to punish rebels, martial might to quell disorder. Once the ruler upholds the Dao, the people naturally turn to virtue and follow transformation—why would there be need to display weapons?\n\nBoats and carriages are metaphors for the *Small Vehicle* (小乘), armor and weapons for the *Small Wisdom* (小智). When the people’s hearts are at ease, these are truly abandoned and unused.\n\n**Wang Yuanzhe** said: If the people suffice within their natural endowments, then there will be no calamities of distant travel or warfare.\n\n**Cao Daochong** said: Great states do not encroach; small states defend their lands. Armor, helmets, spears, and halberds—why use them if there is no war?\n\nLet the people return to using knotted cords to record matters.\n**Wang Yuanzhe** said: Governance is simple, the people are honest—so there is no need for written contracts.\n\n**Emperor Xuanzong of Tang** said: Boats and carriages are for the convenience of migration; armor and weapons are for waging war. Since both are not desired, they are not used, and the people revert to simplicity, returning to the use of knotted cords.\n\n**Explication:** In ancient times, before writing was invented, knotted cords were used to record events. Thus, the *Systematic Discourse* says: \"In the Upper Antiquity, knotted cords were used for governance; later, the Sages replaced them with written contracts, desiring to show that in the age of knotted cords, people were all pure and simple.\" Once writing emerged, deceit and artifice grew daily. Now, to make people forget their emotions and desires and return to purity and simplicity, it is said: \"Let the people return to using knotted cords.\"\n\nLet their food be simple, their clothing fine, their dwellings secure, and their customs joyous.\n**Commentary:** They till the soil and eat; they weave and wear. With mouths full, they play; with bellies satisfied, they wander. If the people can attain this, then:\n- Stopping at what is proper makes food sweet.\n- Removing ornamentation makes clothing fine.\n- Not being disturbed makes dwellings secure.\n- Preserving life makes customs joyous.\n\n**Emperor Xuanzong of Tang** said: Not coveting rich flavors makes their food always sweet. Not laboring over embroidered patterns makes their clothing always fine. Not adorning their homes makes their dwellings secure. Not corrupting simplicity and purity makes their customs joyous.\n\nNeighboring states are visible to one another, and the sounds of roosters and dogs can be heard. Yet the people die of old age without ever visiting each other.\n\n**Wang Yuanzhe** said: This is the governance of fulfilling nature, and the people also fulfill their nature. I have often examined the closing passages of *The Analects* and *Mencius*—both end by praising the virtuous deeds of Yao, Shun, Yu, and Tang. It seems that if one applies this book to governance, its effects will match those of the Sages of those ages.\n\nLaozi was the greatest Sage. Yet the changes he encountered were precisely when the world reverted to its original simplicity and fulfillment of nature. Thus, he alone illuminated the meaning of *virtue* and *power* (德道), gathering scattered matters and uniting them in simplicity and sincerity. If one applies his book to governance, the people will transform and customs will flourish—this chapter’s effect is proof of it. Hence, the *Text’s* intent concludes here.\n\n**Lü Jifu** said: Since the Three Dynasties, until the decline of Zhou, its culture became greatly corrupted. The people lost their natural and vital essence, so Laozi’s words saved them by emphasizing simplicity and returning to the governance of the Great Ancients. Yet the words of *The Book of Poetry* and *The Book of Documents* only reach as far as Yao, Shun, and the Three Dynasties—why does Laozi seek to return to the governance of the Great Ancients?\n\nHe replied: The Dao and the world have long corrupted each other. Only the Great Dao can make people return to their natural and vital essence. If one speaks of the Dao without addressing its worldly manifestations, one cannot truly know that the Great Dao has already been tested. This is why it must necessarily return to the Great Ancient Dao.»",

To harmonize grievances will inevitably leave lingering grievances; to oversee contracts is to not blame others.",

      "translated_text": "The world has long departed from the Great Ancient Dao—can it all be restored?\nHe said: Not yet.\n\nThen what is the purpose of his words?\nHe said: Ritual reached its fullness in the combined practices of the Three Kings, and music in the complete forms of the Six Dynasties. Yet even then, ritual did not place the *xuanshui* (玄水) and *dajīng* (大羹) beneath the *lìjiǔ* (醴酒) and harmonized soups, nor did music add the *huǐguǎn* (嘒管) and clear *qìngqìng* (清磬) above the *zhūxián* (朱弦) and sparse *shūyuè* (疏越)—this was to make people understand the true intent of ritual and music. What was unavoidable was to refine and return to the origins in this way.\n\nAt that time, Confucius was seeking to restore the lost traditions of Wen, Wu, and the Duke of Zhou, while Laozi expounded on the Dao to match the times—his intent was no different.\n\nIt is like the month of *sì* (巳) when fire reigns, yet the *jīn* (金) qi has already emerged within it. This is how the Five Phases succeed one another without interruption.\n\nThus, though the ancients had tenfold or hundredfold tools yet did not use them, had boats and carriages yet did not ride them, had armor and weapons yet did not display them, when great matters arose, they gathered the people—this was unavoidable. Though their people used knotted cords for records, neighboring states were within sight and hearing, yet they grew old and died without visiting one another, it was only when governance grew burdensome, when officials were pressed to enforce laws and supervise travel, that footsteps reached the borders of neighboring states and carriage tracks stretched beyond a thousand *lǐ*—this too was unavoidable.\n\nWhat was unavoidable was always here, yet what they sought to restore was always there.\n\nThen would the Sage not weary of elaborate governance to correct the people’s excesses?\n\nYet if one seeks a world that is not at peace and prosperity, it cannot be attained. Even if he spoke no more, still he would have set aside the *xuanshui* and removed the *shūyuè*—who would know the ritual’s true simplicity and the music’s moderation, or the intent to return to the origins?\n\nThe words of the Sage—how could they be mere trifles?\n\nWhen neighbors live close yet do not interact, when voices are heard but no demands are made, this is the utmost of *wuqiú* (无求). This chapter speaks of small states and few people, where governance is simple and the people pure—thus the Great Ancient Dao could be restored.

      "translated_text": "Shū Wáng said: *\"Sincere\"* is nature. When words approach nature, they are perfect, and this is the utmost harmony of the world. Hence, sincere words are not ornate.\n\nTo govern the world, when the food is sweet, the clothing is fine, the dwelling is secure, the customs are joyful, and the aged die without mutual visits, then governance has reached its peak. If one then gathers and returns to the Dao, this is why it follows with *\"sincere words are not ornate.\"*\n\nWáng Yuànzé said: *\"Sincere words\"* are essential to the Dao. The Dao expressed through speech is plain and without flavor—how could there be ornamentation?\n\n*\"Theft\"* speaks of excessive sweetness; sweetness is the beauty of flavor.\n*\"Prostitute\"* speaks of extravagance; extravagance is the beauty of color.\n*\"Craftsman\"* speaks like a bellows; bellows are the beauty of sound.\n*Sincere words* are those spoken in accordance with the Dao, plain and without flavor, yet not departing from the Dao. Speech without ornate words is not mere appearance. Speech without melodious charm is not mere empty rhetoric. This is why they are not ornate.\n\nOrnate words are not sincere.\n\nHéshàng Gōng said: Ornate words are embellished, flowery language. Insincerity is the adornment of falsehood and the proliferation of emptiness.\n\nJì Wáng said: If words are ornate, they cannot approach nature. Hence, ornate words are not sincere.\n\nWáng Yuànzé said: To speak of affairs without reference to the Dao, though it may please the shallow ears of the unenlightened, it is not profound discourse. Hence, it cannot be fully sincere.\n\nThe virtuous do not argue. Those who truly practice the Dao do not engage in debate or persuasion. Those who argue are not virtuous.\n\nTáng Mínghuáng said: Empty, hollow argumentation is why they are not virtuous.\n\nWáng Yuànzé said: Speech is only for illuminating the Dao. The Dao is concise and unburdened—why use excessive words?\n\nKǒngzǐ said: *\"The purpose of speech is to convey meaning.\"*\n\nThe wise are not all-knowing. *御注*: The wise grasp the subtleties of the Dao, returning to its essence. The *经* says: *\"Few words suffice.\"* *Zhuānwēi* says: The wise understand their Dao. They are clear in principle and know its roots, obtaining its essence alone—why need they be all-knowing? This is what is meant by *\"few words suffice.\"* Those who are all-knowing are not truly wise. *御注*: The more one hears and sees, the more one should simplify.\n\nZhuāngzǐ said: *\"Extensive knowledge is not necessarily profound; eloquence and debate are not necessarily wise.\"*\n\nHéshàng Gōng said: Those who are all-knowing have many experiences but lose the essence and truth.\n\nSū Zǐyóu said: *\"If one has a single thread that unifies all things, then there is no need for extensive knowledge—yet daily growth does not necessarily mean understanding the Dao.\"*\n\nThe Sage does not accumulate.\n\nWáng Bì said: Without private possession, one naturally has abundance; only goodness is given, and things are fulfilled as they come. When one gives to others, one’s own abundance increases. When one gives to others, one’s own abundance grows ever more.\n\nWáng Yuànzé said: *\"To act for others\"* means to apply oneself to affairs and governance of the world. To follow their momentum and benefit them, then one’s Dao is not diminished, and one’s affairs become ever more expansive. *\"To give to others\"* means to impart the Dao. To impart the Dao is like the heavens giving birth to things—I have never expended anything, yet things multiply daily. Since it is said *\"the Sage does not accumulate,\"* it is also clarified that one can satisfy all things. Only by not accumulating can one truly suffice.\n\nCáo Dàochōng said: *\"The richness of boundless generosity is inexhaustible; the response of non-accumulation is limitless. Marvelous use arises daily, and the more one seeks, the more one finds—great generosity gives daily, and the more one takes, the more one prospers.\"* If one accumulates, then there is insufficiency. If one has no hoarding, then there is abundance.\n\nThe Sage’s non-accumulation is also mere emptiness. Emptiness is why one can respond to all demands, while fullness cannot be diminished. This is how one gives to others—one’s own abundance increases, and the more one gives to others, the more one’s own abundance grows.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven benefits without harming; *御注*: Though the *乾* begins by benefiting and sweetly nourishing the world, it does not speak of what it benefits, yet all things are truly benefited by it—never does it cause harm.\n\nLú Yù said: Human affairs benefit one thing while harming another. The Dao of Heaven is balanced, so there is benefit without harm.\n\nGù Huān said: The virtuous obtain the Dao to fulfill their nature; the wicked obtain the Dao to transform their nature. All return to the One, benefiting without harming.\n\nHeaven follows the Dao, hence in spring and summer it nurtures and grows, while in autumn and winter it matures and ripens. This is benefiting without harming.\n\nThe Sage’s Dao acts without striving. Lǚ Jìfǔ said: *\"The words of Lǎozǐ—when observing inwardly the hearts of all, outwardly all things, upward to Heaven, and downward to Earth—there is nothing that does not accord with them. This is sincerity. Yet the common scholar hears them and laughs, the world thinks them like the unworthy. This is not ornate. When speech is most natural, its meaning is most profound—this is virtue. Yet they do not delight in speech—this is not argumentative. Their wisdom reaches to no-wisdom—this is wisdom. Yet their simplicity never departs from my heart—this is not all-knowing. Yet scholars seek ornamentation, argumentation, and extensive knowledge, and thus they are distant. The Dao of Lǎozǐ—though the Sage’s wisdom, it still rejects and abandons accumulation. Hence, reaching to no-accumulation, it satisfies all demands of things, and this is why one’s own abundance increases and grows ever more. Yet scholars cannot carve their hearts here, and thus they cannot attain this Dao. All things have what benefits them and what does not benefit them. What does not benefit them cannot avoid harming them. Only Heaven’s Dao—having no benefit, there is no non-benefit; having no non-benefit, it benefits without harming. All things that act—none do not have ‘self.’ Having ‘self’ means having strife. Only the Sage’s Dao—though acting, it is without action. Being without action means without ‘self,’ and without ‘self’ means without strife. This is the Dao of Heaven alone. The Sage follows Heaven’s Dao—though acting, it arises from non-action. Transformation and fulfillment occur in affairs, yet there is no strife with things. Thus, one’s sagely accomplished deeds are preserved.\"*\n\nThis chapter summarizes the essence of the *经*, speaking in accordance with the Dao.
