  "full_translation": "**(Section I: Opening the Mountain and Felling Trees)**\n\n*Invocation of the Mountain Spirit and Deities*\nHumbly petitioning this locality’s most potent Land Spirit—who traverses the heavens and earth, enters and exits the unseen realms—convey my decree: do not delay. The Black-Horse Land Spirit shall go forth to welcome and invite.\n\nTo the Celestial Officials of the Rivers and Mountains, all temple deities and the hundred spirits, the Mountain King and Sovereign of this domain, the Venerable Broad-Eyed Deity, the ancestral spirits of the earthly domain, the ancient elders of old, the ancestral halls of the soil, all sages and worthies—may they receive my transmission. The disciple, with utmost reverence, invokes the Daoist Master Lu Ban of Hongzhou.\n\nTo the Inner Palace of the Great Emperor, Lady Yun, the Teacher-Father and Teacher-Grandfather, the Venerable Sage and True Lord’s Mother, Lady Wu, the Immortal Sisters—may they be summoned to the place of ablution, receive the command, and take their seats. Offerings of true incense are presented.\n\nWith sincere devotion, I invite the seventy-two generations of masters, the Craftsman Zhang the Great General, Master Zhao the Skilled, and those who have fulfilled their duties before me. The first libation of wine is poured, for wine is the elixir of the immortals. Before and behind the mountain, it is said that wine is the soup of the immortals—now offered to the divine kings. Today, as we open the mountain and fell trees, may the spirits behind protect us in safety. The second libation is poured, the third libation is complete.\n\nThe rites do not require repeated pouring. By decree of the Great Zhonghua Empire, [specific locality], the disciple now seals the Red Mouth.\n\nFor the opening of the mountain and felling of trees, ten long strings of cash are burned to secure the horse’s safety. Before and behind the mountain, to the left and right, if any have offered sacrifices—whether of the Five Tones or Five Clans, male or female, or orphaned spirits—let them all come to receive the money.\n\nThose with halls return to their halls; those without return to the palaces. Manifestations appear in all directions, yet none shall harm the common folk in this realm. After the disciple has opened the mountain and felled trees, there are no taboos in heaven or earth, no restrictions in years or months, no prohibitions in days or times—all is supremely auspicious. Jiang Taigong is present; all spirits withdraw. The Golden Light Edict and the Edicts of the Sun and Moon are proclaimed.\n\n---\n\n**(Section II: Establishing a Miscellaneous Mountain Structure)**\n\n*Invocation of the Land Spirit and Deities*\nHumbly petitioning this locality’s Land Spirit, the Cloud-Mounted Horse, and the Horse Boy—let them go forth to welcome and invite. To the Celestial Officials of the Rivers and Mountains, all temple deities and the hundred spirits, the Mountain King and Sovereign of this domain, the Venerable Broad-Eyed Deity, the ancestral spirits of the earthly domain, the ancient elders of old, the ancestral halls of the soil, all sages and worthies, the Five Directions’ Five Emperors, and the Soil Official’s Venerable Deities—may they receive my transmission. The disciple, with utmost reverence, invokes the Daoist Master Lu Ban of Hongzhou, the Inner Palace of the Great Emperor, Divine Mother Lady Han, Lady Yun, Mother Wu, the Immortal Sisters, the Teacher-Father, Teacher-Grandfather, and all Venerable Sage Lords.\n\nMay they be summoned to the place of ablution, receive the command, and take their seats. Offerings of true incense are presented. With sincere devotion, I invite five or six ancestral masters, the seventy-two generations of masters, the Craftsman Zhang the Great General, Master Zhao the Skilled, the Pure-Ink Boy, the Ink-Level Lord, the Celestial Official Xiao He, the historical disciples of the mountain—Wooden Horse Boys, Pure-Ink Lords—let them assemble at the incense table. The apprentice [name] of the Daoist Master Lu Ban, the Divine Craftsman of Hongzhou, the Immortal Sons and Daughters, and the Immortal kin—may they be summoned to the place of ablution, receive the command, and take their seats with reverence.\n\nThe transmission of the past and the teachings of the present—may the ancestors and grandfathers descend at this time. The historical leaders of the alliance now oversee the construction of the foundation stones and the raising of the beams.\n\nThe spirits are invited in order; the wine is poured to completion. A scroll of scripture is read to ensure the spirits are seated. The Primordial Lock is sealed, and prayers are offered to all spirits. The Land Spirit of the Left and Right Neighbors alone may be purchased—no others shall be improperly honored. The merit is dedicated to the Dao. Within and without, all is tranquil. Each deity takes its proper place, and each guards its domain. The Most High has decreed: sweep away all malevolent spirits, obtain the protection of the Lawful Deities, and safeguard the transmission of the True Way. Return to the Great Dao. All is harmonious, prosperous, and true. By decree, there are no taboos—hear the proclamation of the saints! There are no restrictions in heaven or earth, no prohibitions in years or months, no limitations in days or times. The order is given by hand.\n\n*Proclamation:*\nIn the Great Zhonghua Empire, [specific county, township, village, and location], a house is being constructed and established with purity. Wine and offerings are prepared; the first libation is poured, the second, the third—now complete. The rites do not require repeated pouring. The spirits are seated, and money is offered. The Wind-and-Fire Transmission is complete; private funds are used for seating. The Five Directions are now complete. There are no taboos in heaven or earth, no prohibitions in years or months, no limitations in days or times.\n\n---\n\n**(Section III: Secret Rites for the Incense Altar)**\n\n*The Horse’s Installation and Sacrificial Rites*\nThe disciple holds a rooster to sacrifice to the Horse. The Beam is sacrificed upon its raising. Red envelopes and gold are offered in thanks; the Horse withdraws. All is supremely auspicious and prosperous.\n\n*Five-Directional Seating Rites*\nFor the seating of the Five Directions, wine is offered with five colored fabrics, each measuring one *chi* two *cun*. The wine is poured in three libations to the South, North, East, West, and Center—where the Green, Red, White, Yellow, and Black Emperors and Dragon Deities descend to guard the incense hall. From the South to the East, Center, West, and North, until dawn, all is complete. The disciple’s money and treasures are respectfully offered. The Dragon Deities of the South, East, North, Center, and West return to their homelands.\n\nThe North, East, South, Center, and West are now released. The Black, Green, Red, Yellow, and White Dragon Deities are locked within their domains. Thus, the disciple’s rites are complete. After the teachings are concluded, the five colored fabrics—each one *chi* two *cun*—are distributed.\n\n---\n\n**(Section IV: Raising Water and Securing the Fetus)**\n\n*The Five Phases and Fetal Stability*\nWhen the sun rises, its verdant light reveals the Five-Directional Water-Raising Masters. The first summons the East—Wood, *Jia* and *Yi*. The second summons the South—Fire, *Bing* and *Ding*. The third summons the West—Metal, *Geng* and *Xin*. The fourth summons the North—Water, *Ren* and *Gui*. The fifth summons the Center—Earth, *Wu* and *Ji*.\n\nThe Star Lord of Earth descends to the mortal realm. The first sprinkling stabilizes the Fetal Spirit of the East. The second stabilizes the Fetal Spirit of the South. The third stabilizes the Fetal Spirit of the West. The fourth stabilizes the Fetal Spirit of the North. The fifth stabilizes the Fetal Spirit of the Center. All Five Fetal Spirits are now stable and complete, each dispersing to their respective directions and returning to the gateways.\n\nWith hands in the water bowl, I command—\nThe first sprinkling opens the heavens,\nThe second splits the earth,\nThe third brings longevity to humankind,\nThe fourth annihilates malevolent spirits,\nThe fifth invokes the Six Stars of the Southern Dipper and the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper.\nI, in the name of the **Supreme Venerable Lord Lao** (*Tàishàng Lǎojūn*), act swiftly as the decree commands.\n\n**Jiang Taigong** (*Jiāng Tàigōng*) stands here—\nAll spirits retreat,\nHeaven and Earth have no prohibitions.\n**Pǔ'ān Zǔshī**, the Great Sage of Mastery over the World,\nI beseech you to manifest in my palm.\nI command the spirits of the East, South, West, North, and Center—\nThey rise in the boundless void,\nIn the unclaimed realm,\nIn the unclaimed direction.\nI now summon the Six Stars of the Southern Dipper and the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper.\nI, in the name of the **Supreme Venerable Lord Lao**, act swiftly as the decree commands.\n\n**Pǔ'ān Zǔshī**, **Pútí Zǔshī**, **Língqí Zǔshī**,\nAnd all the Venerable Masters who have come here—\nAfter the water-raising is complete,\nAll prohibitions vanish.\nWith twelve long coins in hand,\nI command in the water bowl.\n\n**(Five) Water-Raising Ritual**\n*Qián yuán hèn lì zhēn* (The Primordial Dao/Way, the Great Virtue/Power, the Nourishing Virtue/Power, and the Perfect Virtue/Power),\nI inscribe the talismans to bind the Six *Ding* (stars),\nTo stabilize the Fetal Spirit within the ten months of gestation,\nTo ensure the Six Livestock are born in six months,\nTo make the grasses of deep mountains unmoving,\nTo halt the waters of sandy slopes from rushing.\nI, in the name of the **Supreme Venerable Lord Lao**, act swiftly as the decree commands.\n\nI transmit the Master’s talisman.\n\n**(Six) Ritual of Striking the Mortar**\nThe first strike resounds until dawn breaks—\nIt startles the household and land spirits.\nThe first strike sends the heavenly spirits back to their celestial realm,\nThe second strikes the earthly spirits into the **Yōumíng** (netherworld),\nThe third drives away malevolent and ferocious deities,\nAll obey my command in terror.\nThe mortar struck to the ground—\nAll prohibitions vanish.\n**Jiang Taigong** stands here—\nAll spirits retreat.\nGreat fortune and auspiciousness abound.\n\nNeither too early nor too late,\nThis is the moment when the disciple strikes the mortar.\nThis is no ordinary strike—\n**Lúbān** (the divine carpenter) bestowed upon me the **Constructing Household Mortar** (*Zào Zhái Chuí*).\nThe first strike sends the heavenly spirits back to their celestial realm,\nThe second strikes the earthly *xié* (malevolent spirits) into the **Yōumíng**,\nThe third sends the ghostly spirits to their western retreat,\nThe fourth prevents evil demons from approaching.\n\nHere, the **Fēi Xióng Dà Jiāngjūn** (Flying Bear Marshal) arrives,\nTurning all **wāngliàng** (goblins and demons) to ash.\nAll prohibitions vanish,\nGreat fortune and auspiciousness abound.\n\nI command with my hands.\n\n**(Seven) Ritual of Sacrificing to the Beam**\n\n「This beam, this beam,\nWhere did you grow? Where did you sprout?\nYou grew before **Qīnglóng Shān** (Green Dragon Mountain),\nYou grew behind **Qīnglóng Shān** (Green Dragon Mountain).\nWho saw you grow? Who saw you flourish?\n**Lúbān** (the divine carpenter) rode through **Línzhōng** (Forest of Pines),\nThis wood, curved and fine, is perfect for a beam.\n**Lǐ Láng** (Master Li) dared not cut it on his way,\n**Zhāng Láng** (Master Zhang) hurried back upon hearing,\nHandraising his **zhuó fǔ** (adze and axe), rushing in haste.\nAt the twelfth hour, he felled a **Chénxiāng** (Sandalwood) beam—one root,\nMeasured with a great **chǐ** (foot): **Yī zhàng bā** (one *zhàng* eight *chǐ*),\nMeasured with a small **chǐ** (foot): **Liǎng zhàng cháng** (two *zhàng* long).\nWith a great saw, he trimmed the head,\nWith a small saw, he trimmed the tip.\nAfter trimming both ends, he sought the middle—\nThe master summoned a skilled carpenter,\nWho carefully shaped and planed it in the woodyard.\nA pair of wooden horses like **yuān yāng** (mandarin ducks),\nA curved ruler and **mòdǒu** (carpenter’s square) like a **fènghuáng** (phoenix).\nA single line of ink, not too long,\nPlaced upon it—radiant and resplendent.\nHewn from the mountain, its scales like **yú lín** (fish scales) and **jīn jiǎ** (golden armor),\nCarved with the **zhuó fǔ** (adze and axe)—beam blossoms for the **shuàngyuán láng** (top scholar).\nChopping, chopping with the adze—\nPlaning, planing with the **bàozi** (plane),\nThe two ends sculpted into **lóng hǔ** (dragon and tiger) forms,\nMidsection filled with **fú lù shòu** (fortune, prosperity, longevity) in abundance.\nThe **Tiānzǐ** (Heavenly Son) bends this beam—\n**Hé shuǐ mángmáng** (River waters boundless),\nGreat fortune and auspiciousness abound,\nLong life and blessings follow in turn.\n\n**Use hand command.**\n\n**(Eight) Ritual of Marking the Beam**\n\n**Tiāndì yángyáng yī kāichǎng** (Heaven and Earth in harmonious brilliance—opening the ritual),\nToday, the disciple marks the **Lifetime Beam** (*Shòu liáng*).\nNot to mention how this beam came to be—\nThis rooster has a lineage to tell:\n**Táng Ráng** (Tang Emperor) sent a melon to wander the **Dìfù** (Underworld),\n**Sānzàng** (the Three Treasures) went westward to fetch the **jīng** (scriptures),\nBringing back three pairs and six eggs,\nReturning home to embrace the **fènghuáng** (phoenix).\nFrom within, he embraced the rooster—\nIn the year of **yín** (the Tiger), he embraced a **yínjī** (silver rooster),\nIn the year of **mǎo** (the Hare), he embraced a **mǎojī** (rooster of the Hare).\nIt grew well-behaved,\nFlying into the disciple’s hands.\nRenamed, reattired—\nCalled the **Marking Beam Rooster** (*Diǎn liángjī*).\nThis rooster marks the beam’s head—\nThe master’s descendants will be **gōng hòu** (noble and illustrious),\nMarks the beam’s tail—\nThe master’s house will be piled with gold and silver.\nMarks the beam’s waist—\nThe master’s fortune and longevity will surpass the heavens.\nAfter marking the head and tail of the beam,\nThe master’s house will be stacked with gold—\nCongratulations, wealth and prosperity arrive!\n\n**Use hand command.**\n**With a long coin of three or five pieces.**»\n\n**(Nine) Secret Utterances for Raising the Beam**\nThe sun shines upon me to settle in,\nThe purple *zhēng* [auspicious omen] spreads across the earth as I turn the scriptures.\nThe Four Great Classics are all turned—\nToday, I install the beam of longevity.\nOn the left, I install a thousand years of auspice,\nOn the right, I install ten thousand years of fortune.\nOn both sides, I install virtue, luck, and longevity,\nIn the center, I install a vault of gold as vast as a *dǒu* [bushel measure].\nSons and grandsons will become *gōng hòu* [noble lords],\nCongratulations—wealth and prosperity arrive!\n**Hand command:**\n*\"Beam-head command, beam-waist command, beam-tail command.\"*\n\n**(Ten) The Rite of Cleansing the Beam**\nToday, I summon the Master of Horses,\nTo welcome the most spiritually potent *tǔdìshén* [land deity] of this place—\nOne who traverses heaven and earth,\nEnters the netherworld and emerges from darkness,\nAnd relays

together,\ngold as large as a *dou* rolls through the door—\ngreat fortune in opening!\n\nNow you come to open the wealth door—\nby which path do you arrive, mountain or water?\nI come from the southeast, passing through north and south,\nthen wandering the Five Lakes and Four Seas.\nMountains bring descendants, waters bring wealth—\nfrom this day onward, after opening the door,\nhonor and riches descend from Heaven.\nGreat fortune in opening!\n\nNow you come to open the wealth door—\nwhat treasures do you bring?\nGold and silver, silk and brocade,\npearls and agate—\nwhere does the gold and silver come from?\nWhere does the silk and brocade originate?\nGold and silver come from the Treasury of Wealth,\nsilk and brocade come from Suzhou and Hangzhou.\nGreat fortune in opening!\n\nNow you come to open the wealth door—\nhow is it constructed?\nConstructed well—\nsummon a carpenter and stonemason to carve floral patterns,\nengrave a money-tree at the column’s peak,\na

*cun*.\n\nProvincial, county, temple, and monastery doors:\none *zhang* one *chi* eight *cun* in height.\nGrand entrance doors: five *chi* seven *cun* high, four *chi* eight *cun* wide.\nResidential doors: four *chi* seven *cun* high, two *chi* three *cun* wide.\nDo not build an east-facing door in spring,\na south-facing door in summer,\na west-facing door in autumn,\nor a north-facing door in winter.\n\nThe *Menglong Star*’s auspicious days are counted downward in large months,\nupward in small months.\nA white circle in the talisman is auspicious;\na *ren* (人) character depletes people,\na *liao* (了) character depletes livestock.\n\n---\n**Eighteenth Section: Auspicious Days for Door *Menglong Star* Construction**\nLarge months: the 1st, 2nd, 7th, 8th, 12th, 13th, 14th, 18th, 19th, 20th, 24th, 25th, and 29th.\nSmall months: the 1st, 2nd, 6th, 7th, 11th, 12th, 13th, 17th, 18th, 19th, 23rd, 24th, 28th, and 29th.\n\n---\n**Nineteenth Section: Diagram of the Five-Beam House**\nThe five-beam structure, whether parallel or square, must avoid the *tanren* (反人遭踏) configuration,\nwhere the *fudou* (袱斗) and *sangfan* (桑烦) disrupt the master’s dwelling.\n\n---\n**Twentieth Section: Five-Beam with Two Rear Beams**\nA five-beam house extended with two rear beams\nfollows the ancient standard—\nthough moderns dismiss it lightly,\nthe uninitiated mock it as \"hidden laughter,\"\nyet it is supremely auspicious.\nIf one constructs a true five-beam house with two rear beams,\nthis is its foundation.\nThe earth holds its own true patterns—\nscholars must ponder these.\n\n---\n**Twenty-First Section: Standard Seven-Beam Structure**\nThe seven-beam house refers to the proper seven-beam design,\nwith single or parallel beams, *dou* and *sang* configurations,\nor columns arranged by human craft.\nDiagrams exist for proper construction.\n\n---\n**Twenty-Second Section: The Method of Raising the *Jiamafa* (架马) for New Construction**\nWhen a new residence is built for the master,\nfire must be avoided in the dwelling.\nAt the start of construction, the master sits upon the *jiamafa* (架马).\nOn an auspicious day for erecting beams,\nthis method applies universally.\nFor demolishing an old house and rebuilding,\nthe *jiamafa* is set up in reverse—\nthe master sits upon it to avoid fire in the dwelling.\nOnce construction begins, the *jiamafa* method is the same as for new builds.\n\n**The *Jiamafa* Method for Repairs**\nWhen repairing a house without avoiding fire in the dwelling,\nthe master selects an auspicious day to begin construction,\nsitting upon the *jiamafa* without observing directional restrictions.\nIf columns are near empty space or within 100 *bu* of a *bing* direction,\nthe *jiamafa* talisman is raised on an auspicious day,\nand construction proceeds accordingly.\nOtherwise, a separate talisman is raised at the proper time,\nensuring no prohibitions arise.\n\n---\n**Twenty-Third Section: The Method of Raising Talismans for Construction**\nIf the master’s age aligns with their current *shichen* (行年),\nthey personally declare their name to the mountain spirits.\nIf the master’s age does not align,\nthe talisman is void, and a disciple who does may act as master,\ndeclaring their name to the mountain and dragon gods.\nThe *deng* (磉) is then determined,\nand the day for erecting columns avoids the master’s birth day\nor days in conflict with their *mingguan* (命官).\nIncense is moved according to the talisman,\nwhich is then hung and sealed in the dwelling.\n\n**When the Western Neighbor Builds**\nIf a neighbor constructs a house,\nthe master’s central hall is measured directly,\nand the *shengge* (圣格) is applied.\nIf the neighbor’s construction falls under:\n- the master’s *nianquanfu* (年官符),\n- the *san sha* (三杀),\n- a *duhuo yue* (独火月),\n- non-official provincial or county talismans,\n- or a *xiaogui* (小鬼) talisman,\n\nthe master must use the *fude* (富德) sitting talisman\nto stabilize the ancestral spirits and fortune gods,\ntemporarily vacating the original boundary.\nThe talisman is then activated in the neighbor’s house,\ntransforming it into an auspicious structure.\nAfter the month’s auspicious days pass,\nthe master’s original dwelling—previously free of *sha* (煞)—\nmust still honor the ancestral spirits and fortune gods,\nthus ensuring the neighbor’s construction remains auspicious.\nThe measuring rope is hung on an auspicious day,\nfavoring *tian de* (天德) and *yue de* (月德),\npreferably on the third *ji* (己) or *zi* (子) day of the month for great fortune.\n\nThe **Lúbān True Measure** (二十四 *Lúbān zhēnchǐ*)\n—when the **Lúbān Measure** is the **curved measure** of one *chǐ* four *cùn* four *fēn*,\nand within it there are eight *chǐ* one *cùn*,\nthis is because the curved measure harms the original [structure].\n\nFor those constructing doors,\nfollowing the **Measure’s Dao** (尺法),\nif one uses a single-leaf door of lesser size,\nopening one *chǐ* one *cùn* one *fēn*—\nthe **Lúbān Measure** is auspicious above—\na single-leaf door should open two *chǐ* eight *cùn*,\nand the **Lúbān Measure** for auspiciousness above,\na double-leaf door should open three *chǐ* three *cùn* one *fēn*,\ntotaling six *yī* (六一).\nThe **Lúbān Measure** is the original door,\ngreat auspiciousness above.\nFor those using the curved measure above,\nfour *chǐ* three *cùn* eight *fēn* totaling wealth-auspiciousness (财吉),\nand for a double-leaf door,\nfive *chǐ* six *cùn* six *fēn* totaling *bǐng* (丙),\nthe **Lúbān Measure** is again auspicious above.\n\nWhen the auspiciousness is aligned with the **Measure’s Dao** (吉上),\nthe artisan should open the door to four *chǐ* three *cùn*,\nwhich becomes the **two-lǐ Measure** (二里般尺).\nFor the auspiciousness of five *chǐ* six *cùn*,\none must add two *fēn* and two *cùn* six *fēn* above,\nand the central pillar (中柱) is the true auspiciousness.\nAll must follow the **Dao** (法) without fail,\na true master artisan.\n\n**Wealth** (财)\n—When the character *cái* (财) appears at the door,\none must carefully examine its placement.\nThe outer door welcomes guests—this is auspicious.\nThe *qí* (奎) of auspiciousness is within the central door,\nand if accumulated, one must use the main door.\nIf the central room aligns with auspiciousness above,\nhang white paper boxes, each containing money.\n\n**Illness**\nA true master artisan, if he can grasp this principle,\nshall bring wealth and honor to his home.\nWhen the character *bìng* (病) confronts the door,\nthe house is stricken by pestilence;\nthe outer door invites spirits and ghosts into the hall.\nIf this character appears at the door or outside the home,\nillness shall forever plague the household.\nWorse yet, if the outer door aligns with it,\nin two years, the corpse shall be sent to the forest.\nTo avoid calamity, one must never adopt this—replace it with a new one.\n\n**Separation (离)**\nWhen the character *lí* (离) appears at the door, matters are unclear;\nexamine closely and see a desolate room.\nIf the *qí* (奎) aligns with the outer door, it becomes a corpse,\nwhile the child faces south and the father north, each divided.\nDaily quarrels fill the home,\nmisfortune and calamity become unbearable.\n\n**Righteousness (义)**\nWhen *yì* (义) or *zhōng* (忠) appears at the door,\nit signifies filial piety and true virtue.\nIf the *qí* (奎) aligns with the outer door, it becomes a household,\nand the veranda’s daughter-in-law brings laughter and joy.\nThough the central room aligns with auspiciousness,\nit may harm prosperity—one must guard against this.\nIf the eight *gāng* (罡) and ten *fēn* (分) bring no disaster,\nthe kitchen may suffer tenfold harm.\n\n**Officialdom (官)**\nWhen *guān* (官) appears at the door, it is auspicious.\nDo not let it rest at the main gate.\nThough the master’s affairs may visit the hall,\nwealth and honor must be guarded in the courtyard.\nA disciple shall become a noble child,\nand an official’s son shall descend early.\nThis is comparable to the spaciousness of the *Guǎng* (广) house.\n\n**Retreat (却)**\nWhen *què* (却) appears at the door, it is not auspicious.\nDaily affairs in the home become like tangled threads.\nIf the door aligns with harm, misfortune follows—\nlayer upon layer, inviting calamity one cannot bear.\nChildren and grandchildren shall retreat, facing hardship,\nwhile the household endures four killings from the *Huáng* (皇).\nTheft and misfortune shall plague others.\n\n**Auspiciousness (吉)**\nWhen *jí* (吉) appears at the door, it is most virtuous and loyal.\nWithin the courtyard stands a single noble son.\nHusband and wife enjoy wealth and honor,\nyear after year, month after month, with smiles and laughter.\nIf the *cái* (财) door aligns with it,\nthe house shall prosper and flourish greatly.\nShould the *qí* (奎) of harm align with one’s position,\neven a good door may bring disaster.\n\n---\n\n**The Measure of the Carpenter’s Rule**\nIf one hundred *rú* (如) or six hundred *rú* (如) aligns with eight *bái* (白) and one *chì* (赤) for昌 (*chāng*),\nit shall harmonize with the *bān* (班) and bring auspiciousness.\nIf reversed, auspiciousness shall diminish while harm increases—\nthe master’s misfortune shall follow.\nThe diagram of the Carpenter’s Rule:\nOne *bái* (白) as six,\nTwo *hēi* (黑), Three *bì* (碧), Four *lǜ* (绿),\nFive *huáng* (黄), Six *bái* (白),\nSeven *chì* (赤), Eight *bái* (白),\nNine *zǐ* (紫), Ten *bái* (白).\n\n**(Twenty-Five) Treatise on the Roots of the Carpenter’s Rule**\nThe Carpenter’s Rule has graded measurements:\nOne *chǐ* (尺) is ten *fēn* (分).\nIn all construction and planning,\nwhen opening a door, its height, length, size, and measure—\nall must be adjusted to fit.\nThe *Lǔbān* (鲁班) Rule of eight *chǐ* (尺) and ten *fēn* (分) determines auspiciousness and harm.\nThe *dù* (度) and *dào* (道) of auspiciousness and harm are daily matters,\nfor a true master artisan.\nBut if this method is followed, great auspiciousness and fortune shall prevail.\n\nTo harmonize the *Lǔbān* (鲁班) Rule with the Carpenter’s Rule,\nthe upper and lower alignments must match.\nThis is the best method for a skilled artisan to build a residence,\nauspicious in its year,\nfacing the green sky—great fortune and auspiciousness shall follow.\nAccording to the *Jiǔ Tiān Xuán Nǚ* (九天玄女) method of door placement,\nthe *Xuán Nǚ* (玄女) adjusts the measurements,\neach *chǐ* (尺) yielding only nine *cùn* (寸),\nwith the remainder discarded.\n\n**(Twenty-Six) Treatise on Wealth, Illness, Separation, Officialdom, Retreat, and Auspiciousness**\nIf the measurements of a house are uneven—\nits length and width, height and depth—\nand the main door connects with the *cái* (财) door,\nit shall bring the greatest auspiciousness.\nAlso, when placing doors for temples or schools,\nthe *guān* (官) door may be installed.\nConnect the main door with the *cái* (财) door for great fortune.\nMost measurement methods follow the artisan’s traditions of woodwork.\nOne must rely on the *Lǔbān* (鲁班) Rule for construction and planning.\n\n**Treatise on Door Opening Steps**\nThe number of steps in opening a door should be single, not double.\nOne step, three steps, five steps, seven steps, nine steps, or eleven steps—\nthese bring great auspiciousness.\nOthers bring harm.\nEach step is measured as four *chǐ* (尺) and five *cùn* (寸),\nbeginning from where the eaves’ water drips,\nand extending to the main door.\nIf the *cái* (财) door aligns with a single step,\nand the main door harmonizes with *yì* (义), *guān* (官), or *bēn* (本),\nthen it shall be auspicious.\nEach follows the artisan’s traditions;\nconstruction must align with the *Lǔbān* (鲁班) Rule for the best.\n\n**(Twenty-Seven) Three-Bay House with Three-Bay Rule**\nThe builder of this house must never make it too tall.\nEach column’s height should be no more than one *zhàng* (丈) and one *cùn* (寸).\nThe beams above the columns should reach one *zhàng* (丈) and two *chǐ* (尺) and one *cùn* (寸).\nThe depth of each segment should be five *chǐ* (尺) and six *cùn* (寸),\nthe width one *zhàng* (丈) and one *chǐ* (尺).\nThe secondary bay should measure one *zhàng* (丈) and one *cùn* (寸).\nThis method is balanced and correct.\n\n**Commentary:**\nWhen constructing a three-bay house,\nall measurements must follow the auspicious alignment above.\nWidth, height, and depth—\nif done according to the Rule,\nthe descendants shall produce noble offspring.\n\n**(Twenty-Eight) Five-Bay House Rule**\nA five-bay, three-room house with the three-bay rule:\none column’s height should be one *zhàng* (丈) and eight *cùn* (寸),\nextended to one *zhàng* (丈) and two *chǐ* (尺) and one *cùn* (寸).\nThe foundation’s width and narrowness\nshould be adjusted by the artisan’s discretion.\n\n**Poem:**\nThree doors, five-bay house,\nif too large, measure carefully.\nFollow the *Lǔ* (鲁) Rule’s true measurements,\nalign the columns properly—\nthen wealth and auspiciousness shall come,\nand horizontal fortune shall multiply.\n\n**(Twenty-Nine) Standard Seven-Bay, Three-Room House Rule**\nA seven-bay hall is grand and tall.\nWhen constructing this house,\nthe front and rear columns should reach one *zhàng* (丈) and two *chǐ* (尺) and six *cùn* (寸),\nthe beams one *zhàng* (丈) and six *cùn* (寸),\nand the segment length four *chǐ* (尺) and eight *cùn* (寸).\nThe foundation’s width and depth,\nas well as the height and narrowness,\nshould be adjusted according to the artisan’s and the owner’s intentions.\nAdditions or subtractions may be made as needed.\n\n**Commentary:**\nWhen constructing this noble hall,\nit depends entirely on the craftsman’s and the master’s foresight.\nWealth and honor derive from the proper use of the measuring line,\nbut one must also align with *yīnyáng* (阴阳).\n\n**(Thirty) Standard Five-Room, Nine-Bay Hall Rule**\nWhen constructing this hall,\neach column’s height should be one *zhàng* (丈) and two *chǐ* (尺) and six *cùn* (寸).\nThe beams or foundation’s width should be one *zhàng* (丈) and four *chǐ* (尺) and eight *cùn* (寸),\nthe depth four *chǐ* (尺) and three *cùn* (寸), or ten *fēn* (分).\nThe height should be two *zhàng* (丈) and two *chǐ* (尺),\nand the beams shall balance it correctly.\n\n**Commentary:**\nThe two characters *yīnyáng* must be considered first.\nMountains should face inward, waters flow outward—align the orientation properly.\nFor halls of nine or five bays,\na thousand years of unbroken fortune are assured,\nall thanks to the Master’s true measuring line,\nwhich ensures wealth—fields of a thousand *mǔ* and boundless prosperity.\n\n**(Thirty-One) Constructing Gate Towers and Newly Built Dwellings—Opening Doors Properly**\nWhen building a gate tower or new residence,\nenter through the main gate first,\nthen establish a secondary gate to the east for the auspicious entrance.\nIf the house is narrow or winding,\navoid having a small *bǐngmén* (丙门) gate—\ninstead, make it no smaller than the outer gate,\nfollowing proper construction methods.\nAbove all, a family’s main gate must never be squeezed by neighboring structures.\n\n**Unfavorable Directions for Doors:**\nHorizontally aligned openings face the following *xīnggān* (赤口) days:\n1st day of the month (辰), 2nd (卯), 3rd (寅), 4th (丑), 5th (戌), 6th (亥), 7th (戊), 9th (子), 10th (赤).\nAdditionally, avoid opening doors on the 12th day of a *zhōngwǔ* (仲冬) year of the Horse.\n\n**(Thirty-Two) Concealing One’s Position—Hiding the Body**\nPlace three copper coins in purity,\nfacing the correct cardinal direction.\nAt sunrise, mark one *yīn* (阴) point on the mountain.\nThe Master commands me to hide my body:\nStore the three *hún* (魂) within

The Black-Horse Land Spirit shall go forth to welcome and invite.\n\nTo the Celestial Officials of the Rivers and Mountains, all temple deities and the hundred spirits, the Mountain King and Sovereign of this domain, the Venerable Broad-Eyed Deity, the ancestral spirits of the earthly domain, the ancient elders of old, the ancestral halls of the soil, all sages and worthies—may they receive my transmission. The disciple, with utmost reverence, invokes the Daoist Master Lu Ban of Hongzhou.\n\nTo the Inner Palace of the Great Emperor, Lady Yun, the Teacher-Father and Teacher-Grandfather, the Venerable Sage and True Lord’s Mother, Lady Wu, the Immortal Sisters—may they be summoned to the place of ablution, receive the command, and take their seats. Offerings of true incense are presented.\n\nWith sincere devotion, I invite the seventy-two generations of masters, the Craftsman Zhang the Great General, Master Zhao the Skilled, and those who have fulfilled their duties before me. The first libation of wine is poured, for wine is the elixir of the immortals. Before and behind the mountain, it is said that wine is the soup of the immortals—now offered to the divine kings. Today, as we open the mountain and fell trees, may the spirits behind protect us in safety. The second libation is poured, the third libation is complete.\n\nThe rites do not require repeated pouring. By decree of the Great Zhonghua Empire, [specific locality], the disciple now seals the Red Mouth.\n\nFor the opening of the mountain and felling of trees, ten long strings of cash are burned to secure the horse’s safety. Before and behind the mountain, to the left and right, if any have offered sacrifices—whether of the Five Tones or Five Clans, male or female, or orphaned spirits—let them all come to receive the money.\n\nThose with halls return to their halls; those without return to the palaces. Manifestations appear in all directions, yet none shall harm the common folk in this realm. After the disciple has opened the mountain and felled trees, there are no taboos in heaven or earth, no restrictions in years or months, no prohibitions in days or times—all is supremely auspicious.

The historical leaders of the alliance now oversee the construction of the foundation stones and the raising of the beams.\n\nThe spirits are invited in order; the wine is poured to completion. A scroll of scripture is read to ensure the spirits are seated. The Primordial Lock is sealed, and prayers are offered to all spirits. The Land Spirit of the Left and Right Neighbors alone may be purchased—no others shall be improperly honored. The merit is dedicated to the Dao. Within and without, all is tranquil. Each deity takes its proper place, and each guards its domain. The Most High has decreed: sweep away all malevolent spirits, obtain the protection of the Lawful Deities, and safeguard the transmission of the True Way. Return to the Great Dao. All is harmonious, prosperous, and true. By decree, there are no taboos—hear the proclamation of the saints! There are no restrictions in heaven or earth, no prohibitions in years or months, no limitations in days or times. The order is given by hand.\n\n*Proclamation:*\nIn the Great Zhonghua Empire, [specific county, township, village, and location], a house is being constructed and established with purity. Wine and offerings are prepared; the first libation is poured, the second, the third—now complete. The rites do not require repeated pouring. The spirits are seated, and money is offered. The Wind-and-Fire Transmission is complete; private funds are used for seating. The Five Directions are now complete. There are no taboos in heaven or earth, no prohibitions in years or months, no limitations in days or times.\n\n---\n\n**(Section III: Secret Rites for the Incense Altar)**\n\n*The Horse’s Installation and Sacrificial Rites*\nThe disciple holds a rooster to sacrifice to the Horse. The Beam is sacrificed upon its raising. Red envelopes and gold are offered in thanks; the Horse withdraws. All is supremely auspicious and prosperous.\n\n*Five-Directional Seating Rites*\nFor the seating of the Five Directions, wine is offered with five colored fabrics, each measuring one *chi* two *cun*. The wine is poured in three libations to the South, North, East, West, and Center—where the Green, Red, White, Yellow, and Black Emperors and Dragon Deities descend to guard the incense hall. From the South to the East, Center, West, and North, until dawn, all is complete. The disciple’s money and treasures are respectfully offered.
