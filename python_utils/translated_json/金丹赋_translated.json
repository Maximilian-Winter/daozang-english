  "full_translation": "**The Preface to the *Essay on the Golden Elixir* (Jīndān Fù)**\n\nThe *Essay on the Golden Elixir* (Jīndān Fù) is a work titled by the disciple of the Dao, **Mǎ Zhāozhào**, who was likely a native of **Jīnqī** (金期).\n\nThis essay elucidates the *Essay on the Golden Elixir* (外丹說) composed by **Táo Zhízhēn Rén** (陶植真人), expanding upon its original text while clarifying the interpretations. It consists of **one volume**.\n\nThe source of this text is found in the **Dòngzhēn** (洞真) section of the *Zhèngtǒng Dàozàng* (正統道藏), under the **Methods** (方法) category.\n\n---\n\n**Preface to the *Essay on the Golden Elixir* (Jīndān Fù Xù)**\n\nI have heard that **life** (生) is the foundation of the **Dao/Way** (道), and only the **heaven and earth, sun and moon** (天地日月) endure eternally. **Teaching** (教) is the supreme expression of the **Dao/Way** (道), and it draws upon the **natural transformations of the cosmos** (造化自然而) to establish its principles.\n\nThe **Primordial Beginning** (元始) hung forth the **millet pearl** (黍珠), subtly expounding the **profound mysteries of the ultimate** (玄玄之義). The **Venerable Master Lao** (老君) ascended upon the **jade shoulder** (玉肩), proclaiming the **silent, tranquil school** (寂寂之宗). Thus, the name **\"Golden Elixir\"** (金丹) was established.\n\nTherefore, in the **Han Dynasty**, **Wèi Bóyáng** (魏伯陽) modeled his *Shēntóng Qì* (參同契) after the *Zhōuyì* (周易). From the **Jin, Tang, and Song dynasties onward**, scholars like **Xǔ Jǐngyáng** (許旌陽) and **Gě Zhìchuān** (葛稚川) reached the utmost heights of attainment, fulfilling the **Dao/Way** (道) in its entirety.\n\nThe disciple **Mǎ Zhāozhào** (馬莅昭), born under the heavens of earth and sky, secretly admires the **mysterious winds** (玄風) of the Dao. Though he lacks the **great path of non-action** (無為之路大辟), his efforts are but humble steps. Yet, the **gateways of myriad marvels** (眾妙之門) are vast, and he must tread with utmost caution.\n\nThanks to the **sage’s guidance** (聖人而推誘), his understanding has deepened, and he knows the **true virtue/power** (真德) of the Dao. Thus, he follows the **method** (隨方引汲) to seek its essence.\n\nHe dares to unfold these **wonderful classics** (妙典), though unworthy, to recite these **profound texts** (玄文). With a **heart as firm as iron** (堅似鐵之心), he carves into the **obstinate ore** (顽矿) of ignorance. With a **mind as vast as ashes** (旷如灰之志), he strives to **harmonize with the numinous root** (契靈根).\n\nHe reflects that **life is fleeting** (浮生), like **water droplets and wind-lit lamps** (水沫風燈), yet the **Dao/Way is eternal** (大道), as **heaven and earth endure** (天長地久). Still, **divine movement is ceaseless** (神運不息), and his **meditation is not refined** (研思岂精). To resolve his **private doubts** (私誠), he seeks no better means.\n\nOnce, while staying in a **traveler’s inn** (旅館), he was startled by the **autumnal cries of cicadas** (空驚秋), their echoes lingering through the night. Facing the **frost-lit lamp** (霜燈), he closed his scrolls in **melancholic concentration** (敛卷凝愁), nearly wounded by the **insects in the wall** (虫砌).\n\nBy chance, he encountered the *Essay on the Golden Elixir* (金丹赋), though he knew not its author. Often reciting this work, he found that his **depressed spirit was uplifted** (自镯其抑). Each time he finished, he would **embrace his knees and lift his head** (抱膝昂首), as if **the Dao had no room to contain him** (顯無所容哉).\n\nYet the **formulas are not arbitrary** (決不辄造), nor the **principles mere speculation** (理不虛拟). They are the **sage’s profound sincerity** (乃聖人之深誠). Truly, my own **stupidity and negligence** (愚是率耽) make it difficult to **grasp the text in full** (難閱具思). Still, I hope to **wander in my mind through subtle principles** (游心妙理), gradually approaching the **true depths of the Dao** (漸迹於真奥之中).\n\nI fear that my **presumptuous attempts** (冒訑筹之科) may be **unworthy of the sage’s teachings** (自責僭瑜之極). Therefore, I **reverently preserve** (謹藏筐筐) this work and **devoutly await the sage’s arrival** (虔候至人), studying it deeply within my heart. I venture to annotate it, though unqualified.\n\n---\n\n**The *Essay on the Golden Elixir* (Jīndān Fù)**\nAnnotated by the **Disciple of the Great Dao** (大道弟子), **Mǎ Zhāozhào** (馬莅昭)\n\nThe **Essay on the Golden Elixir** (金丹赋)\n\n---\n\nWhen the **Dao/Way** (道) is **self-complete** (自成), the sage’s mind is **vast and boundless** (冲邈), containing **illumination and purity** (含亮蛉神), subtly hinting at what is yet to be spoken—hence the saying, *\"The Dao/Way\"* (夫也). The **Dao/Way** (道者) is the **origin of the primordial void** (虚元混成之本). The **Supreme Sage** (太上) said:\n\n*\"There exists a substance, mixed and complete (混成), born before Heaven and Earth (先天地生).\nSilent and vast (寂兮寥兮), it stands alone yet never changes (独立而不改),\ncirculates endlessly yet never falters (周行而不殆).\nIt can be called the **Mother of all things** (可以为天下母).\nI do not know its name (吾不知其名),\nso I call it the **Dao/Way** (字之日道).\nI might also call it **Great** (强谓之日大).\"*\n\nThis reveals that the **Great Dao/Way** (大道) arises from the **primordial void** (太虚), in the **silent and boundless realm** (寂寥之境), transforming into **one breath of *qi*** (生化一气), and then **separating into yin and yang** (分阴阳), establishing **Heaven and Earth** (立天地), and **cycling through the four seasons** (运四时), to **endlessly vary and give rise to all things** (以变有万物). Hence it is said:\n\n*\"Before Heaven and Earth were formed, it was the **Mother of all things** (先於天地之前，为万物之母).\"*\n\nAgain, the **Treatise on the Mysterious Thread** (《玄纲论》) says:\n\n*\"The **Dao/Way** (道者) is the **thread of the primordial void** (虚元之系), the **root of transformation and creation** (造化之根), the **source of divine intelligence** (神明之本), and the **origin of Heaven and Earth** (天地之源).\"*\n\nThis sufficiently clarifies that **Heaven, Earth, and all things** (天地万物) are **contained within *qi*** (含气), possessing **sentience, form, and color** (有识有象有色). All matters of **classification and correspondence** (触类之事) are **endlessly transformed by *qi*** (展转变化无穷), all arising from the **Dao/Way** (皆自道生也).\n\n**Nature** (自然者) refers to the time when the **mixed and complete primordial substance** (混元未辟) had not yet **manifested** (之时), when the **vast and empty cosmos** (寥廓太空) had no boundaries (莫有其际). When the **void reached its utmost** (虚极) and **spontaneously gave rise to *qi*** (自有神), that *qi* was the **most profound and spiritual essence of emptiness** (空之洞至灵者也). Hence, *qi* **moves and transforms**, giving rise to **clear and turbid distinctions** (化气，气分而立清浊之象), and **form** (象设) brings forth the **shapes of all things** (万物化形). The **clear and turbid distinctions** (清浊) and the **shapes of all things** (象形) all originate from the **primordial void** (虚元), yet **who could claim to be their sovereign creator** (岂有主宰制作而为)? This is the **principle that only the enlightened may know** (然之理而知不).\n\nThe **Sage** (圣人), observing that **Heaven, Earth, and all things** (天地万物) **transform and arise spontaneously** (变化之时自), thus called it **Nature** (故日自然). Therefore, one may **contrary to habit** (可违故) yet **follow its principle** (因而制之).\n\nTo **follow its principle** (制之者), one **models the breath of *qi*** (模范一气), **takes the pattern of the two polarities** (取法二仪), and **grasp the subtleties of Nature** (得自然之妙), thereby **attaining longevity and transcendence** (以至长生羽化). How could this be achieved by **merely extending techniques and applications** (法衍作用)? It is **securing the essence of the ultimate truth in Nature** (是得至真自然之理). Thus, it aligns with **Heaven, Earth, the sun and moon**, and **endures eternally** (与天地日月而长久), **remaining perpetually in its natural state** (而常自然而然之). If one **forcibly alters this** (若强然之), then it **will not be natural** (则不然也).\n\nHence, **human beings follow Earth** (人法地), **Earth follows Heaven** (地法天), **Heaven follows the Dao/Way** (天法道), and **the Dao/Way follows Nature** (道法自然).\n\nThe **method** (术) discerns **true and false** (明真假), residing in the **mind as principle** (在心日衍), which **extends into action** (衍作也). When one seeks to **extend and act** (欲衍作之时), one must first **illuminate the principle of the Great Dao/Way** (先大道之理). Having **clarified that the Great Dao/Way originates from the primordial void** (既明大道自虚元太空), and **possesses the root of elemental division** (而有根元分化处所), the **Sage** (圣人) **faces the mixed and complete source of all things** (向混成万物之中), **gazing upward at celestial patterns** (仰观天文), **looking downward at terrestrial formations** (俯察地理), **tracking the movements of stars and constellations** (历象星辰), **the sun and moon** (日月), **exhausting the origins of the four seasons** (穷四时之由), **fathoming the essence of the five phases** (极五行之义), and **establishing the foundation of metal and wood** (而定金木水火), **correlating the symbols of dragon, tiger, tortoise, and bird** (配象龙虎龟雀), **and clarifying the principles of mutual generation, mutual restraint, repose, and dominion** (而明相生相克休王之所), **thus drawing the eight trigrams and nine palaces** (画八卦九官), **completing the patterns of the cosmos** (成天下之文), **extreme in the symbols of mutual generation** (极相生之象), and **teaching the scholar to understand, penetrate its transformations, and exhaust its numbers** (使学者明之，达其变，极其数), **before extending and acting** (然后以衍而作也).\n\n**True and false** (真假者) **are intertwined and arise together** (相混而成也). When **one breath of *qi*** (一气) gives rise to **all things** (而生万物), within **all things** (万物之中), each **bears its own true and false** (各负真假). Yet **what arises from the Dao/Way is not false** (且何者不从道生)? Since all things **arise from the Dao/Way** (既皆从道生), then **all things are without true and false** (则万物无有真假). The **Dao/Way** (夫道者) **permeates the body of non-action** (体贯无为), **embracing Heaven and Earth yet not being great** (包天地不为大), **entering the finest dust yet not being small** (入微尘不为小), **having no favorites nor exclusions** (无亲无疏), **no ugliness nor beauty** (无丑无好), **and being beyond harm** (不可得而害)—how could it **possess true and false** (岂有真假哉)?\n\nYet, when **all things** (万物) **gain benefit or harm from a thing** (於物得利而亲好者), it is called **true** (曰真). When **all things** (万物) **gain harm or aversion from a thing** (於物得害而疏), it is called **false** (丑者日假). The **affection and aversion, benefit and harm** (亲疏丑好，利害) of all things **are all attached to their own nature** (万物皆各有所附). Since each has **its own attachment** (既各有所附), then **desires arise and one becomes immersed in them** (则欲於所欲，而溺於欲而深矣，确矣). Who could **cast aside narrow constraints** (豁廓襟抱), **explore the mysteries beyond form and *qi*** (探妙於形神之外), and **merge with the source of true and false** (混彼真假), **entering the origin of profound meanings** (倪入希义之源) in this way?\n\nNow, with my **stupidity and confusion** (愚迷), I say:\n\n*\"True and false are **Heaven and Earth** (天地), **yin and yang, water and fire** (阴阳水火), **cold and heat** (寒暑), **day and night** (昼夜), **hardness and softness** (刚柔). Yet **Heaven and Earth, yin and yang, water and fire, day and night, hardness and softness** (天地阴阳水火，昼夜刚柔) are all **distinct** (殊矣), yet in relation to the **Dao/Way** (於道), how could they be **different** (岂有异哉)?\n\nHence, **the non-existent generates the existent** (有无相生), **the long and short define each other** (长短相形), **the high and low incline toward each other** (高下相倾), **the difficult and easy complement each other** (难易相成), **sounds harmonize** (音声相和), **and the past and future follow in sequence** (前后相随). Therefore, **all things originally have no falsehood** (万物本无其假), yet **falsehood arises from the true** (假则因真而有假). **All things originally have no truth** (万物本无其真), yet **truth arises from the false** (因假而有真). Just as **yin and yang generate each other** (阴阳相生), **cold and heat oppose each other** (寒暑相反).\n\nHence, **the false contains the true** (假叉有真), and **the true depends on the false** (真叉因假). If one **seeks jade while rejecting stone** (离石求玉), **seeks the high while rejecting the low** (离下求高), **discards night to seek dawn** (弃夜求晨), or **discards the false to seek the true** (弃假求真), then **the true will have no existence** (真无有是也). Thus, one **first speaks of Nature** (故先言自然), then **addresses true and false** (后办真假).\n\nThe **method** (法) is based on the **two polarities** (则两仪). The **method** (法者) is the **extension of principle to its utmost** (衍斯至而为法), **and the illumination of that principle to its extreme** (明斯极而有则). The **two polarities** (两仪者) are **Heaven and Earth** (天地也). To **establish the method of Heaven and Earth** (制之以法天地) is to **set up the tripod and crucible** (而立鼎器).\n\nTo **follow the two polarities** (则阴阳) is to **cycle through the four seasons** (而运四时), so that **the *qi* transforms within the furnace and crucible** (使化气於炉鼎之中), **and the Dao’s *qi* circulates, mirroring Heaven and Earth** (周道气而行天地). The **Classic** (经) says:\n\n*\"Residing in the center to govern the outer\"* (处中以制外). Hence, it **depends on calendrical records** (故在於历纪). This means that within the **Great Elixir’s furnace and crucible** (大丹於炉鼎之内), the **center holds the laws of time** (中含律历), the **outer governs the records of Heaven and Earth** (外制天地之纪), and **binds the essence of the ultimate truth** (结至真之精). One cannot **fail to clarify the numbers of transformation and creation** (不可不明造化之数), **and seize the authority of Heaven and Earth** (夺天地之权), to **attain the method of complete transformation** (以至化成之道乎). Hence, the **method is based on the two polarities** (故言法则两仪也).\n\nTaking the **symbols of the eight trigrams** (取象八卦). To **take the symbols of the eight trigrams** (取八卦之象). The **Book of Changes** (《易》) says:\n\n*\"The **trigrams** (卦者) are **what is hung** (言乎挂者也).\nThe **symbols** (象日) are **what is represented** (言乎象者也), **as if suspending images of things** (言如悬挂物像), **to demonstrate them to people** (以示於人), hence they are called **trigrams and symbols** (故以卦象而称也).\"*\n\n**In Heaven, symbols are formed** (夫在天成象), **in Earth, shapes are formed** (在地成形), and **transformation and manifestation are evident** (变化见矣). Hence, the **Sage** (圣人) **gazes upward, following Heaven’s method to grasp symbols** (仰法天而取象), **looks downward, observing Earth’s shapes** (俯於地而察形), **and sings of the subtle essence of Heaven’s origin** (歌晓天元之微), **drawing the eight trigrams** (画八卦).\n\nThe **Eight Trigrams** (八卦者) are **Kàn (乾), Kǎn (坎), Gèn (艮), Zhèn (震), Xùn (巽), Gāo (离), Kūn (坤), Duì (兑)**—also.\n\n**Kàn** (乾) consists of three long lines, the **pure yang** (纯阳) **stem** (爻). It represents **Heaven** (天), **Metal** (金), **the Sovereign** (君), and **the Father** (父). Its position is in the **west-north**, facing **Kūn** (坤) to complete the union of **Heaven and Earth** (合天地).\n\n**Kūn** (坤) consists of three short lines, the **pure yin** (纯阴) **stem** (爻). It represents **Earth** (地), **Soil** (土), **the Minister** (臣), and **the Mother** (母). Its position is in the **west-south**. Since it is generated by **Fire** (火), its place is paired with **Gāo** (离) in the **comparative** (比) position.\n\n**Zhèn** (震) has two short lines above and one long line below, the **two yin, one yang** (二阴一阳) **stem** (爻). It represents **Thunder** (雷), **Wood** (木), **the Eldest Son** (长男), and **the Azure Dragon** (青龙). Its position is in the **east**, facing **Xùn** (巽) to complete the union of **Heaven and Earth** (合天地).\n\n**Xùn** (巽) has two long lines above and one short line below, the **two yang, one yin** (二阳一阴) **stem** (爻). It represents **Wind** (风), **Wood** (木), and **the Eldest Daughter** (长女). Its position is in the **south-east**, and it issues **commands and orders** (行号令).\n\n**Kǎn** (坎) has two short lines above and below, with one long line in the middle, the **two yin, one yang** (二阴一阳) **stem** (爻). It represents **Water** (水), **the Moon** (月), **the Dark Tortoise** (玄武), and **the Middle Son** (中男). Its position is in the **north**, with one yang emerging between two yin, hence on the **eleventh month**, the **Winter Solstice** (冬至), **yang qi** (阳气) arises beneath the Earth. It faces **Gāo** (离) to complete the union of **Heaven and Earth** (合天地).\n\n**Gāo** (离) has two long lines above and below, with one short line in the middle, the **two yang, one yin** (二阳一阴) **stem** (爻). It represents **Fire** (火), **the Sun** (日), **the Vermilion Bird** (朱雀), and **the Middle Daughter** (中女). Its position is in the **south**, as the **heart of Heaven** (天之心), with one yin emerging between two yang, hence on the **fifth month**, the **Summer Solstice** (夏至), at **high noon** (停午), the **yin qi** (阴气) descends from above.\n\n**Gèn** (艮) has one long line above and two short lines below, the **one yang, two yin** (一阳二阴) **stem** (爻). It represents **Mountain** (山), **Soil** (土), and **the Youngest Son** (少男). All things encountering **Gèn** (艮) come to a halt. Its position is in the **north-east**, facing **Duì** (兑) to complete **Kàn and Kūn** (合乾坤).\n\n**Duì** (兑) has one short line above and two long lines below, the **one yin, two yang** (一阴二阳) **stem** (爻). It represents **Marsh** (泽), **Metal** (金), **the White Tiger** (白虎), and **the Youngest Daughter** (少女). Its position is in the **west**, and it serves as the **moon’s cavity** (月窟).\n\nNow, **Kàn** (乾) and **Kūn** (坤) are both **pure yang and pure yin** (纯阳纯阴) **trigrams**, hence they are **extreme** (极) and represent **Heaven and Earth** (为天地). **Xùn** (巽), **Gāo** (离), and **Duì** (兑) are all **two yang, one yin** (二阳一阴) **trigrams**, hence they all represent **female** (为女). **Zhèn** (震), **Kǎn** (坎), and **Gèn** (艮) are all **two yin, one yang** (二阴一阳) **trigrams**, hence they all represent **male** (为男). Why so? Because when **yin is predominant and yang is scarce**, **yang is the master** (阳为主). When **yang is predominant and yin is scarce**, **yin is the master** (阴为主). In all cases, the **minor** (少) is what the **major** (多) holds dear, and the **one** (一) is what the **many** (众) revere. Thus, the **minor** is the **precious** (多之所贵), and the **one** is the **honored** (众之所尊).\n\nThe **stems** (爻) of **Kàn** (乾) and **Kūn** (坤) are both **pure yin and yang** (纯阴阳), lacking **centrality** (中) and **non-centrality** (不中). **Zhèn** (震) and **Gèn** (艮) each have **two yin, one yang** (二阴一阳), yet the **one yang does not occupy the center** (不得其中). **Xùn** (巽) and **Duì** (兑) each have **two yang, one yin** (二阳一阴), yet the **one yin does not occupy the center** (不得其中). Whenever **yin and yang do not occupy their proper center**, though they may undergo **transformation and change** (变化), they cannot **harmonize** (通). Hence, **Kǎn** (坎) and **Gāo** (离) each have one yang and one yin respectively, both residing in the **center of yin and yang** (居阴阳之中), thus enabling **Heaven and Earth to communicate and return** (通天地还返).\n\nTherefore, when **following the Dao of the Two Principles** (法二仪之时), one must **take the symbols from the Eight Trigrams** (取象於八卦).\n\n**Dividing Heaven and Earth** (辟天地) to establish distinctions—**dividing** (辟) means **opening** (开). Within the **chaotic Primordium** (混元), there exists the **True Spirit** (真神), which **circulates the One Qi** (运一气) and **divides Heaven and Earth** (辟天地). Once **Heaven and Earth are divided**, they **cover and load** (圆覆方载), bringing forth **warmth and cold, chill and heat** (暄凉寒暑). **Metal, Wood, Water, and Fire** (金木水火) each return to their proper domains. The **distinctions within Heaven and Earth’s transformations** (区分天地之内变化之事) endure through **kalpas** (历劫), as a constant. Therefore, the **Sage** (圣人) **establishes the Dao and instructs people**, pointing to this **Primordial division and distinction** (混元开辟，区分之象).\n\nNow, those who **cultivate the Great Elixir** (修大丹) seek the **profound and mysterious meaning** (玄奥之义). Hence, the **Highest Lord** (太上) says:\n\n*\"How vast is the Great Thing beneath Heaven! It is indeed **endless and unfathomable** (甚绵绵冥冥), **chaotic and indistinct** (混沌不可知).\"* This is said to **recognize the Sage** (认圣人) and **explain the principle of cultivating the Great Elixir** (拆大丹之理). The **Great Thing** (大物) exists beneath Heaven, **endless and unceasing** (绵绵不绝常有), yet it is **unfathomable and chaotic** (冥冥混沌), akin to the **Great Primordium** (太元).\n\nThe **True Spirit’s qi** (真神之气), **dividing Heaven and Earth** (开辟天地), **distinguishing the Five Phases and Four Seasons** (区分五行四时), achieves **harmonious transformation** (变化之功齐矣), yet its **principles and meanings are profound and hidden** (而理义幽隐). In vain do they **diligently study golden chapters and jade books** (徒孜孜於金章玉书), yet the **common people cannot know them** (而世民不可知).\n\n**Gold** (金) **takes the symbols of the Eight Trigrams** (取象八卦), and **each is arranged within the crucible** (各使区分於鼎器之内), also **dividing Heaven and Earth** (天开地辟) to **complete the Great Elixir** (而成大丹). **Blending yin and yang** (混阴阳) to bring forth **transformation and change** (变化).\n\n**Blending** (混) means **unifying** (同). **Yin and yang** (阴阳) are the **qi of transformation and change** (变化之气). Before **yin and yang are activated**, they are **unified and indistinct** (未运而混同). Once **yin and yang are activated**, they **generate transformation and change** (运而生变化).\n\n**Yang** (阳) is the **qi of Heaven** (天之气). It first emerges from the **extreme yin** (极阴) within the **Nine Earths** (九地), beneath the **mid-winter month** (仲冬之月), on the **central day** (中气之日), at **midnight** (夜半子时), **brewing and moving** (蕴然而动), **gradually ascending and nourishing** (渐资上升), **revolving leftward in the east** (左旋束面), and **transforming and generating all things** (生化万物), reaching its **peak in the south-east** (以至东南), as the **position of abundant yang** (为盛阳之位).\n\n**Yin** (阴) is the **qi of Kūn** (坤). It first emerges from the **extreme yang** (极阳) within the **Nine Heavens** (九天), above the **mid-summer month** (仲夏之月), at **high noon** (停午之时), **quietly and subtly** (微然而静), **gradually descending and flourishing** (渐渐滋长下沉), **revolving leftward in the west** (左旋西面), and **congealing and solidifying all things** (凝实万物), reaching its **peak in the north-west** (以至西北), as the **position of abundant yin** (为盛阴之位).\n\nTo **understand the Great Elixir within the crucible** (明大丹於鼎器之内), one must recognize that the **True Primordial yin-yang qi** (真元阴阳之气) exists there. When the **True Qi** (真气) **circulates and turns** (运转), the **Eight Trigrams follow in order without confusion** (八卦从律而不杂), and the **Five Colors form patterns without disorder** (五色成文而不乱). With **yin and yang qi complete** (阴阳气全) and **the Dao of transformation and change fulfilled** (变化道足), the **Great Elixir is achieved** (而成大丹矣).\n\n**Pointing to Kàn and Kūn by their forms and positions** (指乾坤以形以位)—**pointing** (指) means **indicating their symbols** (指其象). One **takes the forms and symbols of Kàn and Kūn** (取乾坤形象), **arranges their positions** (安排位次), **establishes the crucible** (立其鼎器), and **cultivates the Great Elixir** (而修大丹). The **Classics** (经) state:\n\n*\"Kàn and Kūn are the **crucible** (鼎).\"*\n\n「The forms of **Kàn and Kūn** (乾坤) resemble the **symbol of the rooster and the fourth watch** (鸡卯之象), hence the **Classics** (经) say:\n\n*\"A rounded, high peak arises from the center,\nIts shape like a **blue-black gourd** (蓬壶).\"*\n\nIt is also said:\n\n*\"It resembles a **hen’s egg** (鸡子),\nWhere **yellow** (黄) and **white** (白) **mutually support** (相扶),\nThe **dense mists** (须蒙) must be **solid and integrated** (密固济) to achieve this.\"*\n\nIn the **hen’s egg** (鸡卯), the **yellow** (黄) is within, while the **white** (白) surrounds it. During the **embryonic state** (抱伏), it receives the **warm qi of the mother** (母暖气), and after **twenty-four days** (二十四日), it transforms into **eyes, beak, claws, and feet** (赀眼爪脚), as well as **plumage and patterned feathers** (毛羽文彩). This is the **True Qi’s spontaneous transformation** (得真自然而化)—how extraordinary!\n\nThus, the **yellow and white mutually support** (黄白相扶),\nAnd **solidly coalesce** (铃然而成).\n\nThe **fourth watch** (卯) must not be **blooded** (血)—if **blooded** (血), the **True Qi** (真之气) will scatter, and the transformation will naturally fail.\n\nIt is also said:\n\n*\"The forms of **Kàn and Kūn** (乾坤) resemble a **human head** (人首).\"*\n\nThe **Classics** (经) state:\n\n*\"The head resembles a **blue-black gourd** (蓬壶).\"*\n\nAnother **Classic** (经) says:\n\n*\"The **brain** (脑) is the **soul’s sacred altar** (灵宗), the **cavern of life’s essence** (百神之命窟), the **source of fluids** (津液之山源), and the **refined essence of the Golden Elixir** (金泥之精魂). Thus, the **stomach pool** (胃池) maintains its **rectangular form** (体方) to receive nourishment, while the **brain chamber** (脑官) remains **rounded and void** (圆虚) to offer the **True Qi** (真). With **ten thousand orifices planted** (万穴植立) and **thousand pores generating mist** (千孔生烟), its **virtue/power** (德) is **complete as heaven and earth** (备天地), and its **Dao/Way** (道) aligns with the **Great Mystery** (太玄). Therefore, it is named **Hun Yuan** (混元, *Mingled Primordial*).\n\nThe **Daniwan** (泥丸) is the **upper spirit of the physical form** (形躯之上神). By **positioning** (以位), it means that to cultivate this **Great Elixir** (大丹), one must first recognize the **forms and symbols of the rooster and the fourth watch, and the brain chamber** (鸡卯脑官二种形像), whose **method resembles Kàn and Kūn** (法似乾坤), and then **establish the crucible** (而立鼎器) and **circulate its Qi to determine its placement** (运而为其位).\n\nIt is also said:\n\n*\"The **gateway of the *Yì* (易)** is the **parental origin of all Trigrams** (众卦之父母). It corresponds to the **south and north** (南北), with **taking and releasing** (取舍) in kind. By **kind** (类), it means **analogous in form and essence** (比类体同). The **south and north** (南北) are the **directions of Great Yin and Great Yang** (太阴太阳), the **positions of the Elixir’s Dark and True aspects** (丹玄丹真), and the **Trigram of Kǎn and Lí** (坎陷离丽). **Taking** (取) refers to **Kǎn’s high and rising Qi** (坎高), while **releasing** (拾) denotes **Lí’s luminous and descending Qi** (离丽). When **Kǎn’s high and Lí’s luminous Qi merge** (坎高相合), they form **heaven and earth** (天地). The **Qi of the two Trigrams intermingles** (二卦气交), and thus **one takes, one releases** (一取一拾). When the **favorable day arrives, one takes** (得善日取), and when it departs, one releases (失善日拾). This meaning is **profound and subtle** (义幽隐), beyond what **written words** (翰简) can fully convey. To understand its **origin** (由), one must **penetrate the subtle essence of the two Trigrams** (洞晓二卦之微). Only then can one **exhaust the meaning of taking and releasing** (穷取拾之义) and grasp the **mystery of the human crucible** (人鼎器之妙).\n\nThe **Daniwan** (氏房) **leaps and dances within the Azure Dragon** (腾跃於苍龙). The **Daniwan** (氏房) are the **stars of the Twenty-Eight Lunar Mansions** (二十八宿) in the **northwestern quadrant** (束方). **Azure** (苍) refers to **green** (青), and **Dragon** (龙) signifies the **Qi of the northwestern quadrant** (束方之气). The *Zhōuyì Zhōng Zhèngyì* (周易中正义) states: *\"The Dragon can transform, and the Yang Qi can also transform, hence it is called **Dragon Qi** (龙气).\"* When the **eastern quadrant’s myriad trees flourish** (东方万木荣生), the **green and azure Qi** (青苍之气) is at its peak. Therefore, when **refining the Elixir with Fire** (运火修丹), by the **second month of spring** (仲春之月), the **True Qi** (真气) within the **Great Crucible** (大鼎) reaches its height, mirroring the **Azure Dragon’s leaping and dancing within the northwestern quadrant** (苍龙腾跃束方). The **Daniwan stars tremble and respond** (氏房之星摇动), hence the **Wei Lord’s ode** (魏君歌) says:\n\n*\"The Azure Dragon dwells in the **Daniwan** (房) of the sixth mansion,\nSpring’s radiance **shakes the northwestern quadrant** (震束卯).\"*\n\nThe **wings spread and the belt connects to the White Horse** (翼张襟带於白马). **Wings spread** (翼张) refers to the **stars of the Twenty-Eight Lunar Mansions in the southern quadrant** (二十八宿南方之星). **Belt and sash** (襟带) means **interconnected** (通连). The **White Horse** (白马) is the **guests of the first-grade Great Elixir** (初品大丹之客). The *Huáinán Zǐ* (淮南子) says: *\"The White Horse’s **teeth** (牙) love **cinnabar** (丹砂).\"* **White** (白) is the **color of the west** (西方色), and **Horse** (马) is the **beast of the south** (南方兽). **Teeth** (牙) refer to the **substance of the Elixir** (丹之物). It is also said that the **Daniwan spreads its wings, the Azure Dragon connects its belt** (氏房张翼苍龙), all **interconnected** (皆襟带通连)—the **southern beasts**, the **western white**, when **refining the Elixir with Fire** (运火修炼), reach this stage and thus form the **first-grade Great Elixir** (初品大丹).\n\nOne must **consolidate the essence and substance of Kàn and Kūn** (固乾坤之形质). **Consolidate** (固) means **to secure firmly** (牢固). Those who **master the techniques of refinement** (制赋之士) speak of this with **grave seriousness** (郑重). Indeed, **Kàn and Kūn are the crucible** (乾坤鼎), likened to the **hen’s egg** (喻如鸡卯). If **blooded** (若血), the **embryonic state will not yield True Qi** (抱伏不成真). If the **crucible is loose** (鼎疏), the **transformative Qi will disperse beyond heaven and earth** (化气流散天地之外), and its **core will be lost** (中失造化之本). For those who **craft the Divine Elixir** (作神丹), the **meaning of consolidation** (固际之义) is indeed profound. In these words, if one does not **exhaust the mysteries of the spirits and know the transformations** (穷神知化), how could they **grasp the meaning of consolidation** (明固际之义)?\n\nTo **consolidate the essence of Kàn and Kūn** (固乾坤之质) is neither **to fixate through consolidation** (非以固际之功而固) nor **to neglect consolidation** (非不以固际之功而固). Why? Because **Kàn and Kūn are natural** (乾坤自然), not something to be **consolidated**. If one does not **consolidate**, then **Kàn and Kūn will be destroyed**, and **heaven will tilt while earth collapses** (天倾地沦).\n\nOne must **shed the flesh and bones, becoming effortlessly refined** (脱肌肉而潇洒). **Shedding the flesh** (脱肌) means **liberation** (解脱). **Flesh and bones** (肌肉) are synonymous here. **Effortlessly refined** (潇洒) signifies **serene clarity and emptiness** (澄静清虚), **without attachment or obstruction** (无亲无挠). The **Song of the Five Elements in the *Yì*** (太易至五行歌) states:\n\n*\"What need for **metal, wood, water, fire, and earth** (金木水火土)?\nHold fast to **soul and spirit** (留神宝命), for they are the **Dragon and Tiger** (龙虎).\nScholars who fail to recognize the **Five Elements’ essence** (五行精),\nForcefully claim others’ **Five Elements as parents** (他人为父母).\n**Wood governs Qi** (木主气), **bones govern metal** (骨主金),\n**Blood mirrors water** (血象水), **flesh mirrors earth** (肉象土).\nThe **Dao of immortality** (不死之道) lies in **transformation and change** (变化也).\n**Follow the Dao’s timing** (顺天时) and **revere the Dao’s cycles** (奉天).\"*\n\n**Follow** (顺) means **not to contravene its timing** (不悖其时). To **contravene its timing** (逆其时) invites **calamity and harm** (钟灾害), while **aligning with its order** (顺其序) brings **blessings and auspiciousness** (降嘉祥). The **Classics** (经) say:\n\n*\"The **Five Qi** (五气) **follow their natural sequence** (顺序), **responding to the times** (应时) and thus **achieving harmony** (而得).\"*\n\nIt is also said:\n\n*\"Like a charioteer holding the **reins** (街辔),\nMeasuring against the **plumb line and ink line** (绳墨),\nFollowing the **tracks and wheel ruts** (轨辙).\n**Centered to govern the periphery** (处中以制外),\nThis is **found in the calendrical records** (故在於历纪).\"*\n\nThis speaks of those who **control Fire** (御火之士), like a **charioteer guiding the reins** (执衔辔), making the **horses and chariots obedient to their path** (车马驯其轨辙) without deviation. They **harmonize with the four seasons, eight nodes, twenty-four Qi, and seventy-two solar terms** (四时八节，二十四气，七十二侯).\n\n**Revere the Dao’s cycles** (奉天) is as the *Yì* (易) says:\n\n*\"Act before heaven, and heaven will not resist.\nAct after heaven, and you will **revere the Dao’s timing** (奉天时).\"*\n\nIf **heaven itself does not resist** (天且弗违), how much more so for **humans** (人)? This clarifies that once the **Great Elixir is formed** (大丹既成), its **procreative forces generate ceaselessly** (孳引相生), like **acting after heaven and revering the Dao’s timing** (后天而奉天时), nurturing **ancestors through descendants** (子孙而养父母), ensuring its **enduring legacy across ages** (历亿不绝).\n\nOne must **pair the female and male** (必雌雄而配偶). The **Classics** (经) say:\n\n*\"Yang does not stand alone, Yin does not dwell alone.\nThe **Dark Tortoise and the Black Dragon** (玄武) **coil and lean to support each other** (盘斜相扶).\nThis illustrates **female and male** (牝牡), **each requiring the other** (竟当相须).\"*\n\nThus, **female and male** (雌雄) refer to **Yin and Yang** (阴阳). **Kǎn’s male aspect** (坎男) is **Yang** (雄), and **Lí’s female aspect** (离女) is **Yin** (雌).\n\n「Thus, **Qián** (乾) is the **Father** (父), with three **male aspects** (三男): **Zhèn** (震), **Kǎn** (坎), and **Gèn** (艮).\n**Kūn** (坤) is the **Mother** (母), with three **female aspects** (三女): **Xùn** (巽), **Lí** (离), and **Duì** (兑).\n\nNow, when **pairing these male and female aspects** (配此雄雌), why single out **Kǎn** (坎) and **Lí** (离)?\nIt is because only **Kǎn** and **Lí** attain the **center** (中),\nwhile **Zhèn** (震), **Gèn** (艮), **Xùn** (巽), and **Duì** (兑) do not.\n\nThus, **Kǎn’s male aspect** (坎男) and **Lí’s female aspect** (离女)\nare **matched and paired** (匹配而偶) as **husband and wife** (夫妇).\nHence, **Taoist Master Yáo** (陶公) said:\n*\"The male wears the cap, the female smiles—\n**Yin and Yang** (牝牡) **harmonize** (相得),\n**qi** (气) **intermingles** (交), bodies **unite** (合),\nresponding to transformations **without end** (应变无穷)—\nthis is the **application of the Dao** (道之用).\"*\n\nThe **Classics** (经) further state:\n*\"Observe the moment when **Yin and Yang** (阴阳) **interact and coalesce** (交会),\ngrasp their **rhythms and correspondences** (节符) beyond dissolution,\nthen you will understand their **pairing** (配偶)\nand the **formation of the Great Elixir** (成大丹).\"*\n\nTo **ascend as an immortal** (上仙) is to **fulfill the three-year labor** (终三年之功毕).\n**Ascending as an immortal** (终) refers to **completing the three-year practice** (三年之功毕).\n**Soaring and hovering** (翱翔) means the body **returns to pure Yang** (归纯阳),\nwith **all vital essences whole and light** (万神全而轻举),\nsoaring above the realms of **Sān Qīng** (三清), **Tài Xū** (太虚), and **Tài Wēi** (太微).\nThus, it is called **ascending as an immortal** (上仙).\n\n**Immortal** (仙) means **to stand firm like a mountain** (立人山).\nThis **Great Elixir** (此大丹) **nourishes the spirit** (神为宝),\n**fortifies the bones** (骨为金),\nmaking them as **unshaken as a mountain** (不动之山).\nFrom ancient times, there have been **those who transcend the material** (物外之人),\nmeaning **those who have attained the Dao** (得道之人),\n**those who undergo metamorphosis** (羽化之士),\nand **those who prolong life and maintain youth** (长生久视者),\nall of whom follow this **eternal tradition** (常流),\nascending from the **common to the sacred** (自凡入圣).\nThus, they are called **those who transcend the material** (物外者).\n\nMost people **cling to desires through material attachments** (因物以生欲),\n**drowning in the physical world** (溺於物).\nTo **drown in the material** (溺於物) is to be **entangled in the dusty net of mundane life** (拘於尘网).\nIf one **does not cultivate nor desire** (不营不欲),\n**has no concerns nor attachments** (无虑无拘),\nthen one is said to **transcend the material** (物外).\n\nThe **Classics** (经) say:\n*\"To transcend the world is to possess the world;\nto transcend the self is to preserve the self.\"*\n\nThe **material** (物) can **sustain life** (资身) as well as **destroy it** (灭身).\nThus, **those who pursue the True** (修真之士)\n**empty themselves and forget their form** (虚己忘形),\n**nourishing life** (资於生) while **avoiding its decay** (避其息).\nIf one **achieves fame and success** (功成名遂) yet **remains immersed without measure** (溺而无数),\nwhat wisdom is there in this?\n\nYet **those who transcend the material** (物外人) **do exist** (爰有).\nBy **nature, they inherit the Dao’s pristine essence** (性禀天真).\n**True** (真) is the **manifestation of the Dao** (道之纪).\n**Master Zhēn of Wú** (吴真人) said:\n*\"The spirit **inherits the Dao** (神禀於道),\n**stillness aligns with nature** (静而合乎性).\nHumans **inherit the spirit** (人禀於神),\n**action aligns with sentiment** (动而合乎情).*\nThus, **following nature** (率性) makes the spirit **concentrated and discerning** (神凝而察),\n**attaining the Dao’s pristine essence** (天真).\nBut **indulging in sentiment** (为情) makes the spirit **disturbed and impure** (神挠),\n**inviting perverse qi** (邪气自袭).\n\nTherefore, **sentiment disturbs the spirit** (情动神浊),\n**nature stills the spirit** (性静神清).\n**Clarity** (清) allows one to **enter the wondrous gate** (参入妙门),\n**grasp the Dao’s pristine essence** (得天真之理),\nand **keep the spirit within** (神监於内).\nHence, it is said that **nature inherits the Dao’s pristine essence** (性禀天真).\n\n**Embrace the harmonious will and qi** (抱冲和之志气).\n**Embrace** (抱) means **to nurture** (蕴).\n**Harmonious** (冲和) is the **balanced qi of heaven and earth** (天地中庸之气).\nThe **pure Yang of heaven** (天之纯阳) is **radiant and vast** (赫赫),\nthe **pure Yin of earth** (地之纯阴) is **dark and profound** (冥冥).\nIf **pure Yang resides above** (纯阳在上)\nand **pure Yin dwells below** (纯阴居下),\nthen **heaven and earth do not communicate** (天地不通),\n**all things do not generate** (万物不生),\n**Yin and Yang do not intermingle** (阴阳不交)—\nhow could **good and evil be distinguished** (岂能分别善恶)?\n\nOnce **heaven and earth intermingle** (天地既交),\n**Yin and Yang blend and ascend** (阴阳混蒸),\n**giving rise to all things** (生有万物),\n**balance lies between heaven and earth** (正在天地之间),\ncalled **harmonious qi** (冲和之气).\n**Harmonious** (冲和) means **equilibrium and moderation** (均平之义),\n**the will of the sage** (志公之心).\n\nThus, when **undertaking actions or triggering transformations** (举事发机),\nit is like **drawing a bow** (张弓):\n**the high is lowered** (高者抑之),\n**the low is raised** (下者举之).\nLike **striking a bell to find its center** (动铃取中),\nit is said to be **the will and qi** (志气).\n\n**Avoid the mud and dust of the mortal world** (厌寰海之泥尘).\n**Avoid** (厌) means **to reject** (弃).\n**The encircling seas** (寰海) are the **four seas connected and winding** (四海相通逆而绕).\n**Mud and dust** (泥尘) are the **earth within the encircling seas** (寰海之内地).\nThis earth, when **wet, becomes mud** (有水则泥),\nwhen **dry, becomes dust** (乾燥则尘).\n**Mud can soil** (泥能污物),\n**dust can obscure** (尘能蒙之).\nWhen **soiled to the point of corruption** (污已至于归),\nit is **worthy of rejection** (可厌弃).\n\nThen, **one seeks the methods of immortality** (寻不死之方).\n**Methods** (方) are **symbols** (象).\nThe **sages establish teachings through symbols** (圣人指象以立教),\nthus there are the **《Ancient Text of the Dragon and Tiger, Gold and Jade》** (《古文龙虎金碧上经》) in three volumes,\nthe **《Golden Jade Classic》 by Zǐyáng** (紫阳《金碧经》) in three chapters,\nthe **《Golden Jade Secret Transmission Classic》** (《金碧潜通诀》) in three volumes,\nthe **《Canon of the Three Realms and the Two Treasures》** (《周易参同契》) in three chapters,\nthe **《Great Ease Treatise》** (《太易志》) in twenty-four sections,\nand **countless sages and masters** (得道诸仙诸子)\nwho **expound and record** (演而着之) these teachings—\n**too many to enumerate** (莫可胜数).\nAll discuss the **gates of refining the Great Elixir** (修制大丹之门),\nsaying that **to ingest it is to attain immortality** (服之不死).\nHence, it is called **seeking** (寻).\n\n**To seek the elixir of longevity** (求延龄之诀),\nthe **sages do not fail to point and emphasize** (非不指之而丁宁),\nbut it is because **people seek externally without enlightenment** (自是求人而不悟).\n**Master Chōngxū** (冲虚子) said:\n*\"The path of the immortal is linked to the cloud-soaring crane,\nnot treading the **crooked beams** (偏梁) nor the **sword-like pass** (剑阁).\nThe world does not know the **immortal’s path** (仙路),\nwhich **differs entirely from the worldly path** (与世路都不同).\nThey only point to the **roots of the mountain passes** (关山根),\n**erring in confusion without number** (迷错自数言).\"*\nThis refers to **people not knowing the gate to seek the elixir** (不知求诀之门).\n\n*\"To seek the elixir’s key** (夫求诀者),\none must **first seek within oneself** (当自求).\nThe **bell** (铃) is **found in the study of the *Canon of the Three Realms and the Two Treasures*** (推考《参同》),\nthe **sword** (剑) is **found in the *Golden Jade Classic*** (骯《金碧》).\nTo **grasp the heavenly symbols externally** (外明天象)\nand **unite with the Dao’s mysteries internally** (内合玄庭),\nto **compress the subtle and wondrous within the heart** (撮微妙於心中),\nand **forge transformations within the spirit’s resonance** (机造化於神契).\nThus, **Master Chōngxū** (冲虚真人) said:\n*\"The immortals are not in other realms—\nthey are **found in the clarity of the heart and the spirit** (明公心与神).\"*\n\nAgain, the **《Treatise on the Immortals’ Teachings》** (《神仙可学论》) states:\n*\"Is the Dao far away?\n**Practice it, and you will reach it** (行斯至矣).\"*\n\n**The Dao’s ultimate void contains profound mystery** (至虚蕴妙),\n**awaiting stimulation to manifest** (待感而灵).\nLike **metal and stone holding resonance** (金石含响),\n**awaiting striking to chime** (待击而呜).\nThus, **open the mind’s chamber** (豁方寸) to **guide the void** (导虚).\nWhen **void is attained, stillness follows** (虚则静以感),\n**stillness brings clarity** (感则通),\n**clarity brings cosmic order** (通则宇宙大定),\nand **heavenly light shines forth** (天光发耀).\nThis is how one **recognizes the void and stillness** (可认虚静),\n**nurtures the profound and refined** (蕴妙精),\n**stimulates to achieve unity** (感而通)—\nthe **essence of the Great Elixir’s key** (大丹诀).\n\nAgain, **Master Yānluó** (烟萝子) said:\n*\"Those who pursue the True** (夫学真之士),\n**all must uphold an external perspective** (挺方外之见),\n**nurture the profound mysteries of the Dark** (蕴重玄之机),\n**communicate with the Dao’s essence** (与道通真),\n**discern the central rectitude within** (内明中正),\n**remain serene and tranquil in emptiness** (恬淡虚寂),\n**move in accordance with the profound depths** (动合渊微),\n**later viewing heaven and earth within the span of their hands** (后观天地於指掌中),\n**seeing the six directions within the tip of a hair** (视六合於毫芒之内).\n**The minute is not too small to enter** (细无不入),\n**the vast is not too great to encompass** (大无不包).\n**True and false, right and wrong—\nyou can distinguish them clearly** (真伪是非，子能分辫).\nOnly then can you **settle in the True Valley and preserve the spirit** (栖真谷神矣).\"*\n\nThese teachings—\n**how can one merely dwell in the body and await the elixir’s key** (岂可尸居而待诀)?\n\nThus, the unenlightened and vulgar seek the heavens and earth,\npray to the gods and spirits,\npay homage to the sun and moon,\npursue the True Scriptures,\nstudy *yin-yang*,\nfathom the workings of creation,\nrecite and ponder without ceasing,\ndelve and research without rest,\nunraveling subtle words,\ndissecting hidden mysteries,\ntesting them in stillness,\nstriking them in emptiness—\nyet even after more than two *ji* (centuries),\nthey still have not glimpsed an encounter with the Dao,\nlet alone received even a hint of its essential teachings.\n\nYet the sages have already set their intent:\nto attain *sensing-through* (感通).\n\n**The essence of the Golden Elixir (金丹之奥旨):**\nThe Golden Elixir is made of gold, hence its name.\n*The Dragon-Tiger Mirror* (《龙虎镜》) states:\n*\"The celestial symbol shines brightly—none greater than the sun and moon.\nThe sun is the fiery essence of *Taiyang*—the vermilion mercury, the Dragon.\nThe moon is the aqueous essence of *Taiyin*—the lead and silver, the Tiger.\"*\n\nIt further says:\n*\"Vermilion cinnabar is the child of fire.\nMercury is the grandson of gold.\nGold is born from the sun,\nsilver nurtured by the moon.\nSun and moon interact,\nwater and fire unite,\nDragon and Tiger follow,\n*yin* and *yang* regulate—\nthus forming the Great Elixir.\nThese two treasures are the most refined of heaven and earth;\nwhen obtained and refined, they are called the Golden Elixir.\"*\n\nIts essential teachings are found in:\n*The Golden Purity Scripture* (《金碧经》),\n*The Grand Synchronization Contract and Great Ease Manifestation* (《参同契太易志》),\nand *The Sun-Moon Primordial Unity Scripture* (《日月混元经》).\nThese true texts all reveal the profound essence of the Golden Elixir,\npenetrating the subtle and reaching the marvelous—\nworthy of investigation and pursuit.\n\n**The profound sayings of the Cavernous Mysteries (洞玄妙之真说):**\n*Dong* (洞) is the unobstructed radiance of wisdom.\n*Xuan* (玄) is water and fire—\nwater’s blackness is *Xuanming* (玄冥),\nfire’s redness is *Danxuan* (丹玄).\nThe *Laozi Song* (老君歌) says:\n*\"Take the essence from black gold, the marrow from red—\nthe unparalleled elixir is refined.\nUse red in black to preserve longevity,\nuse black in red to become a celestial immortal.\nThe two inverted methods are both called *Xuan*;\nblack can transform red, red can grant immortality.\"*\n\n*Miao* (妙) refers to the marvel of the two *Xuan*s:\nwater’s essence is the moon,\nfire’s essence is the sun,\ncycling through the Cavernous Void,\ntransforming all things—\nits marvel is profound indeed.\nThe scripture further says:\n*\"Water can generate all things—\nonly the sage knows this.\"\nAnd again:\n\"Two without origin, one with substance—\nthe soul’s transformation is wondrous and hard to fathom.\nThus it is called *Miao* (marvelous).\"*\n\nThe True Scripture states:\n*\"Words are not carelessly forged,\ndiscourses are not baseless.\nUnless the elixir is perfected and the Dao attained,\none cannot record its essential teachings—\nthis is the sage’s warning.\nThus, *The Golden Purity*, *The Grand Synchronization*, and *The Great Ease*\nare the true essentials.\"*\n\nThus knowing the *yāoyāo míngmíng* (窈窈冥冥),\nwithin which lies the *jing* (精).\nKnowing this—\nthrough *The Golden Purity* and *The Grand Synchronization*,\nthe true sayings of the Golden Elixir’s profound marvels—\nonly then does one begin to grasp that in the *yāoyāo míngmíng* lies the *jing*.\n\nThe *Taishang* (太上) says:\n*\"Hū (惚) and huǎng (恍)—\nwithin them lies form.\nHuǎng (恍) and hū (惚)—\nwithin them lies substance.\nYāo (窈) and míng (冥)—\nwithin them lies the *jing*,\nits *jing* most true,\nwithin it lies authenticity.\nThis is so.\"*\n\nAgain, water is *Xuan* (玄),\nfire is *Dan* (丹).\n*Yāo* (窈) and *míng* (冥) mean deep.\nWater is externally dark and internally luminous—deep,\nfire is externally luminous and internally dark—obscure.\nThe *jing* (精) is the essence within water and fire.\n\n*The Sun-Moon Primordial Unity Scripture* says:\n*\"The cauldron is heaven and earth,\nthe elixir is sun and moon,\nwater and fire are *yin* and *yang*.\nMercury does not reveal its form,\ngold does not display its shape.\nMercury lies within cinnabar,\nlike the sun’s crow (乌).\nGold lies within black lead,\nlike the moon’s rabbit (兔).\nThe sun’s fullness in the heavens\ncan be seen in vermilion cinnabar and mercury.\nThe moon’s waxing and waning\ncan be seen in black lead and white gold.\n'Does not reveal its form' and 'does not display its shape'\nboth speak of concealment.\nSince the cauldron is heaven and earth,\nand the elixir is sun and moon,\nand the sun and moon are within the cauldron,\ntheir *qi* and *po* (精魄) reside within the sun and moon—\nhow could they be seen?\nThus, they do not reveal their form.\"*\n\n**Penetrating the elixir field with the One *Qi*:**\n*Guan* (贯) means to connect and pass through.\nThe scripture says:\n*\"Heaven has three *Xuan*s—sun, moon, and stars.\nMan has three *Zhen*s—three *dantian*s.\nThe three treasures are lead, mercury, and cinnabar.\nThe One *Qi* is the True Dao.\nTrue *qi* moves subtly—\nin heaven, it becomes the three luminaries;\nin man, the three *dantian*s;\non earth, the three treasures.\nThus, the elixir field is the One *Qi*.\"*\n\n**Examining the two names of water and fire:**\nThe Dao is formless and invisible—\nseen, it is not seen;\nheard, it has no sound.\nIt moves subtly, generating water and fire.\nThus, one examines:\nwater is one, fire is two—\ntheir numbers make three,\nand three generates all things.\nKnowing this, one regulates them accordingly.\n\n**Distributing the four symbols:**\n*Distributing* refers to the One *Qi* circulating—\nin the north as winter, the *Kan* (坎) symbol;\nin the east as spring, the *Zhen* (震) symbol;\nin the south as summer, the *Li* (离) symbol;\nin the west as autumn, the *Xia* (兑) symbol.\n\n**Refining the five phases:**\n*Refining* means smelting in the furnace,\nmelting and casting—\nall names for creation’s work.\nThe five phases are metal, wood, water, fire, and earth.\nAn ancient song says:\n*\"The five phases’ profound meanings are hard to fathom.\nAgain, it says:\n'Carefully observe the five phases—you yourself will see them.'\nAgain:\n'To complete the four symbols,\nto form the five spirits.'\nThe One *Qi* divides into *yin* and *yang*,\ncirculates as the four seasons,\nultimately forming the five phases.\nLike a person with four limbs,\nadding the head—\ncalled the five phases.\nThus, when refining fire,\nthe true *qi* in the cauldron divides into *yin* and *yang*,\n*yin* and *yang* generate the four symbols,\nthe four symbols complete and form the five phases.\nThus, *Lizhenren* (李真人) says:\n'Water one, metal four—\nthis becomes *wu* earth.\nFire two, wood three—\nthis becomes *ji* earth.'\nAll are achieved by refining fire,\nand by self-creation from metal—\nthus, it is called *modification* (修炼).\"*\n\n**Restraining the sun’s *hun* and calling forth the moon’s *po*:**\n*Restraining* means stillness.\n*The Long Life Chapter* (《长生篇》) says:\n*\"The sun’s *hun* and moon’s *po*—\nthe forms of *Qian* and *Kun* are complete.\nThe sun’s *hun* is the golden crow (*Jinwu*),\nthe moon’s *po* is the jade rabbit (*Yufu*).\"*\n\nThe *hun* and *po* breathe in and out,\nThe crow and toad swallow and exhale.\nWhen refining the Great Elixir,\nEven as the *hun* and *po* breathe, they remain still.\n\nFollow the tiger’s nature and harmonize with the dragon’s essence.\n*Follow* means to adhere, to inherit.\nThe tiger is the Western White Tiger.\n*Nature* is the measure of the Dao.\n*Contract* means to unite things with things.\nNow, uniting essence with nature—\nthus, it is called *harmonize*.\n\nThe dragon is the Eastern Azure Dragon.\nThe Great Elixir’s dragon and tiger natures and essences\nare like a person’s liver and lungs—\ntheir natures and essences.\nThe liver, green, belongs to wood—this is the dragon.\nThe lungs, white, belong to metal—this is the tiger.\n\nIt is also said:\nThe dragon is essence, the tiger is nature,\nand essence and nature depend on and return to each other—\nthis is the natural order.\n\nIt is also said:\nNature governs the inner, establishing *Yin* and *Wei*.\nEssence governs the outer, constructing walls and ramparts.\n\nIt is also said:\nEssence and nature in humans are not external things,\nand the dragon and tiger in things are not their own kind.\nThus, it is said to follow and adhere.\n\nTherefore, the *Yijing* is expounded to show the period,\n*Expound* means to extend.\nThe *Yijing* discusses the Dao of Heaven and Earth,\nand the Sage expounded it to establish teachings,\nso that refining the Great Elixir has its fixed stages.\n\nThe Great Dao is profound and mysterious.\nThe *qi* of transformation begins in the eleventh month,\nthe central *qi* governs it,\nthe time of Heaven’s rectification,\nand one *yang* is born, reaching its peak in the fourth month,\nthus forming the *Qian* body.\n\nAgain, from the fifth month,\nthe central *qi* generates one *yin*,\nreaching its peak in the tenth month,\nthus forming the *Kun* body.\nAll this expounds the numbers of sun and moon,\nand establishes the periods of transformation—\nthus, this is said.\n\nThe Dipper sets its position.\n*The Dipper* refers to the handle of the Northern Dipper,\nthe Grip Star.\nIn the first month, the Dipper points to *Yin*,\nin the second month, to *Mao*,\nin the third month, to *Chen*—\nfollowing the monthly *tiān* stems,\nthe Dipper points and moves.\nSetting *Zi, Chou, Yin, Mao, Chen, Si, Wu, Wei, Shen, You, Xū, Hài*,\nit is said that when refining fire,\nthese twelve positions are set,\nand the Dipper Star is observed.\n\nFollowing the *Feng* and *Yì* to disperse their hues,\n*Follow* means to revolve.\n*The Winnowing Basket* is the star of the Eastern *Xiù* in the *Shíèr Xiù*.\n*The Wings* are the stars of the Southern *Xiù*.\n*Disperse hues* means that when refining fire,\nit is like the sun traversing the Twenty-Eight *Xiù*,\nrevolving and dispersing its hues.\n*The Winnowing Basket* appears on the third day of the month.\n*The Wings* mark the full moon on the fifteenth day.\nExternally refining the fire,\ninternally following the laws of time,\nand dispersing the hues.\n\nContinuously linking *Gèn* and *Duì* to harmonize the *qi*.\n*Continuous* means unbroken.\nThe Classic says:\nMountain and marsh connect,\n*Gèn* and *Duì* harmonize the *qi*.\n*Gèn* belongs to earth, positioned in the Northern *Xiù*.\n*Duì* belongs to metal, positioned in the Western *Xiù*.\n*Si* and *You* are the metal positions.\nAlso, the *Gèn* hexagram receives *Bing*,\nthe *Duì* hexagram receives *Ding*—\nthus, it is said to harmonize the *qi*.\n\nDisseminate virtue and punishment to unite the firm and yielding,\n*Disseminate* means to apply.\n\n**Punishment** is killing.\n**Virtue** is giving life.\nThe Classic says:\nVirtue governs birth and rise,\nPunishment governs suppression and death.\n**Merge** means to gather.\n**Firm** refers to Fire and Metal.\n**Yielding** refers to Water and Wood.\nIt speaks of refining Fire to disseminate true *qi*,\narriving in Spring to bring forth life,\nin Autumn to execute punishment and kill.\nWater, Fire, Metal, and Wood—\nFirm and yielding merge,\nall responding to the seasons to form the Elixir.\n\nEntering the **#1** central palace and returning to *Wu Ji*.\nThis refers to Metal and Wood, Water and Fire,\nas bandits of virtue and punishment, firm and yielding,\nentering the central palace,\nreturning to *Wu Ji* Earth—\nWater and Metal become *Wu*,\nWood and Fire become *Ji*.\nThen the Nine Circulations transform.\n\n*Then* means time.\nNine is the number of extreme Yang.\nThe *Arithmetic Classic* says:\nNumbers only reach nine;\nten returns to one.\nAgain, the Classic says:\nThe Sun is the supreme Yang,\nits number is nine.\nThus:\n*Kàn* is one, *Kūn* is two,\n*Zhèn* is three, *Xùn* is four,\nthe center is five, *Qián* is six,\n*Duì* is seven, *Gèn* is eight,\n*Lí* is nine.\n**Circulation** means to traverse.\nIt speaks of refining Fire when,\nwithin the great furnace,\ntrue divine *qi* moves\nin unison with the Sun’s daily degree,\nfive days per watch,\ntransforming all things,\nuntil the tenth month when its count ceases,\nreturning to one—\nthus, the Nine Circulations transform.\n\nSeven returns reveal beauty.\nSeven is the Metal of *Duì*.\nTo depart and return is called **return**.\n**Beauty** means uprightness.\n*Duì* is the Moon’s cavern;\nthe Moon begins to wane, turning right,\nfrom the South toward the Northern *Xiù*,\nentering Earth below,\nchanging and unsettled,\nretreating to its original Western position,\nthus revealing its beauty.\n\nThis arises from external uprightness and internal compliance.\n*This* means here.\n**External uprightness** is Heaven.\n**Internal compliance** is Earth.\nThe Great Medicine is like a chicken’s egg—\nwhite on the outside for uprightness,\nyellow within for compliance—\nembracing warm *qi* to form the Elixir,\narising from inner yellow and outer white,\nupright and compliant.\n\nThen it becomes **mysterious beyond mystery**.\n**Mysterious** refers to Water and Fire.\n\nThe Great Dao moves as one *qi* to generate Water and Fire—this is the first **mysterious**.\n\nLater, the Sage followed Heaven and Earth, moving Water and Fire to forge the Divine Elixir. This is **mysterious again**.\n\nWhen Fire coils and turns, it becomes the Dragon;\nwhen Water turns westward, it becomes the Tiger.\n\nHeaven’s wheel turns leftward,\nthe Sun and Moon and Five Stars rotate rightward.\nHeaven’s wheel turns leftward, governing the Four Seasons;\nthe Sun and Moon rotate rightward, transforming all things.\n\nThus, cinnabar is red, symbolizing Fire,\ndwelling in the Southern position,\nmanifesting as the Vermilion Bird,\nand when coiled, water silver emerges within it.\nIts color is green, symbolizing Wood,\ndwelling in the Eastern position,\nmanifesting as the Azure Dragon.\nLead is black, belonging to Water,\ndwelling in the Northern position,\nmanifesting as the Dark Warrior,\nand when turning westward, white silver arises within it.\n\nHence it is said: Fire coils and turns to become the Dragon,\nWater turns westward to become the Tiger.\n\nThis speaks of the True *qi* of the Great Cauldron operating in secret,\nmimicking Heaven’s wheel turning leftward,\nmimicking the Sun and Moon and Five Stars turning rightward,\nall within the Cauldron’s single *qi*—\nnot external things.\n\nThe ancient song says:\n*The Dragon is not in the Eastern* **Qí**,\n*The Tiger is not in the Western* **Fú**.\nIf one seeks it in the One Principle,\nIts truth is clearly known—\ngood and bad alike.\n\nIf one seeks it in the West,\neven with eyes, one remains blind.\n\nThe Tiger sheds its form to nurture its young,\nthe Dragon departs the clouds to bring rain.\n\nThe Tiger is Metal.\nOnce white silver separates from black lead’s womb,\nit returns to its own mother,\nstill nurturing its offspring—\nthus the saying: *shedding form to nurture young*.\n\nThe Dragon departs the clouds to govern rain—\nthe clouds hide within mountain valleys,\nlike the *qi* of cinnabar.\nOnce water silver emerges from cinnabar,\nit becomes the Azure Dragon of the East,\nbringing rain and nourishing all things.\n\nIs it not that after white and black comes yellow,\nand after water and fire comes Earth?\nThis is the same principle governing cinnabar and water silver.\n\nWhen it is said \"first white and black, then yellow,\"\nit refers to water silver within cinnabar.\nWater silver—\nwhen spoken of as water, it bears the black symbol,\nwhen spoken of as silver, it bears the white symbol.\n\nWhen it is said \"begin with water and fire,\"\ncinnabar is Fire, water silver is Water—\nthus, before water silver emerges from the ore,\nit is said to begin with water and fire.\n\nOnce cinnabar and water silver possess white and black,\nfire and water,\nthe four symbolic colors,\nthey follow Heaven and mirror Earth,\nrefining Fire through practice,\naligning with the Four Seasons,\nuntil completion—\nall returning to Earth.\n\nAbandoning the South to take from the North—\nto take or to gather,\nthe *Classics* offer three paths.\n\n「Initially, one gathers from the North and takes from the South,\nthen later gathers from the South and takes from the North.\nThis is why—\nsince the sovereign’s position lies in the North,\nwhile the minister’s lies in the South,\nthe sovereign remains sovereign,\nthe minister remains minister.\nYet when the sovereign withdraws and the minister ascends,\nor the minister withdraws and the sovereign ascends,\none gathers from the South and takes from the North—\nthis is the principle of *Jia-Yi* following the ancestral Dao.\n\nThe ancestral Dao—\nthis refers to Heaven and Earth.\n*Jia-Yi* are the first two of the Ten Heavenly Stems.\n*Jia-Yi*, *Ren-Gui*, *Bing-Ding*, *Wu-Ji*, *Geng-Xin*—\nthe Ten Heavenly Stems,\nlike Heaven and Earth enveloping and bearing all things.\n\nThus, the *Qian* hexagram’s six lines\nassign the lower three to *Jia-Yi*,\nthe upper three to *Ren-Gui*.\nThe *Xian* hexagram’s six lines\nassign the lower three to *Yi*,\nthe upper three to *Gui*.\nHence, it is said *Jia-Yi* follow the ancestral Dao.\n\nDivine Water and Sacred Stone—\nWater and Stone have both common and sacred forms.\nJust as people have both ordinary and enlightened ones.\nThose who wish to rise from the common to the sacred\nneed only abandon form and discard wisdom,\ngather the body and banish cleverness,\nbecome like withered wood,\nheart like dead ashes—\nthus attaining the Dao.\n\nWater refers to water silver,\nStone refers to cinnabar.\nBefore water silver and cinnabar are refined according to the method,\nthey are common.\nOnce the cauldron and vessels are established,\nfollowing Heaven and Earth,\nharmonizing the One *Qi*,\ngenerating Yin and Yang,\nthe Four Seasons complete,\nthe Five Phases whole,\nthey become Divine and Sacred—\nhence, Sacred Stone.\n\nThe Sovereign’s Son and the Dragon Daughter—\nThe Sovereign is the master of Heaven and Earth.\nThe Son is the Sovereign’s heir,\none who seeks to succeed the Heavenly position—\nthen it is the son of the Southern Vermilion Sovereign.\nThe Dragon Daughter is also the daughter of the Southern Vermilion Sovereign,\nspeaking of the Dragon lineage.\nThe Sovereign, master of Heaven and Earth,\nthe honored one of all transformations,\nhas ministers of the North and South,\nall appointed by the Sovereign.\nNorth and South are Yin and Yang.\nIf the Sovereign’s Son ascends to his sacred position\nand governs Yin and Yang...»\n\nThe ancient song says:\n\n*\"One mother bears two children,\none male and one female.\nThe male is the root of Yin,\nthe female, the master of Yang.\nYin departs, Yang arrives—\nnever straying from their ancestral source.\nThe spleen grinds food to self-consumption,\nreturning together to the Earth of the Afterworld.\nThis is the Emperor’s lineage,\nseated upon the central land’s throne.*\n\n*The Dao originates not apart from the Mysterious Yellow.\nThe Dao—nameless, formless, boundless *qi*—\nmoves and gives birth to all transformations.\nThe Mysterious Yellow: Heaven and Earth.\nWithin Heaven’s Mysterious and Earth’s Yellow,\nall things are threaded.\nAll transformations arise within Heaven and Earth.\nNow, refining within the cauldron,\ntrue *qi* transforms—\nnever straying from the Mysterious Yellow.\n\n*Preserve the One while guarding the Three and Five.\nThe *Hun Yuan Jing* says:\n‘Three and Five with the One—\nHeaven and Earth’s utmost essence.\nYin and Yang interact, the Dao self-generates.’\nIt also says:\n‘Three and Five with the One—\ndiscerning sovereign and minister.\nDo not exceed the Five Phases,\nnor contravene the Heavenly Dao.’\nAgain it says:\n‘If you know not Three, Five, and One,\nwhere shall you seek the Land of the Immortals?’\nAnd again:\n‘The utmost essence does not exceed guarding the One,\nestablishing principle does not exceed the Three Powers,\nbreaking the theme does not exceed the Five Phases,\nconcealing treasures does not exceed Water and Fire.\nAll analogous methods converge upon this One.’\n\n*Now, in my humble words:\nThe One generates the Two,\nthe Two generates the Three,\nthe Three generates all things.\nEarth is the soil transformed by the Four Symbols.\nEarth is the Dao’s *qi*—\nall things arise from Earth.\nGold is the root of the True One,\nthe master of all transformations.\nThough Earth generates Gold,\nit does not overpower it.\n\n*One cold, one hot—\nKàn and Lǐ, Water and Fire—\nthus forming the Elixir.\nKàn’s Water is winter’s cold,\nLǐ’s Fire is summer’s heat.\nOne cold, one hot—\none Yin, one Yang—\none Gold, one Stone—\nthis is called the Elixir.\n\n*The Dragon and Tiger breathe in tandem.\nThe scripture says:\n‘The Dragon exhales to the Tiger,\nthe Tiger inhales the Dragon’s essence—\nmutually consuming, mutually honoring each other.’\nIt also says:\n‘The Dragon is emotion,\nthe Tiger is nature—\nemotion and nature interdependent,\nthe principle of return.’\n\n*This is called: transformations arise from the True,\nbeginning and end mutually dependent—\nthus the logic of breathing becomes clear.\n\n*The soul and spirit inhale and exhale.\nWhen the Dragon and Tiger breathe in tandem,\nthe Moon exhales the spirit,\nwhile the Sun swallows the soul.\nSouth and North copulate within Water and Fire,\nthe *Zǐ* and *Wǔ* revolve within *Mǎo* and *Yǒu*.\nWater is in the North—Kàn, the male, Yang.\nFire is in the South—Lǐ, the female, Yin.\nSouth and North copulate.\nThough *Mǎo* is in the East and *Yǒu* in the West,\nat the time of refinement,\nthey revolve within the cauldron—\nnever straying from *Zǐ* and *Wǔ*.\n\n*Summarizing the *Qián* and *Kūn* registers,\nthe master of leisurely transformations.\nSummarizing Heaven and Earth’s registers—\nthis is the *shù* (numerical principle).\nThe scripture says:\n‘The *Qián* register has two hundred sixteen,\nthe *Kūn* register one hundred forty-four.\nExtending and elaborating,\ncomparing and expanding—\ntotaling fifteen hundred twenty,\nexhausting all things’ numbers,\ncompleting the firm and yielding—\nthus it is called summarizing.’\n\n*The leisurely Dao of transformations—\nKàn and Lǐ.\nThe scripture says:\n‘Kàn and Lǐ vanish and reappear,\ntheir luminous essence descending to nourish all.’\nThis means the Kàn and Lǐ hexagrams\nare not counted among *Qián* and *Kūn*—\nthus ‘vanish and reappear.’\nLeisurely within the Six Void,\ndescending to nourish all things with luminous essence,\ntransforming all things.\n\n*Now, I illustrate with symbols.\nThis is the *Qián* hexagram.\n*Qián* inverted once becomes *Xùn*,\ntwice inverted is *Gèn*,\nthrice inverted is *Kūn*.\nAgain, *Kūn* inverted becomes *Zhèn*,\ntwice inverted is *Duì*,\nthrice inverted returns to *Qián*.\nThus, when *Qián* and *Kūn* are in effect,\nonly *Xùn*, *Gèn*, *Zhèn*, and *Duì* appear—\nKàn and Lǐ’s symbols are absent.\nHence, ‘vanish and reappear’—\nKàn and Lǐ are Sun and Moon,\ndescending their numbers to transform all things.\n\n*Mother and child encompassed within the square and circle,\nnurtured and dependent upon the cauldron’s gold.\nMother and child: true *qi* and mercury.\nEncompassed: blended together.\nSquare and circle: Kàn and Lǐ.\nThe *Zhuó Shēng Lùn* says:\n‘Kàn and Lǐ as square and circle,\nreturning to the axle’s center.’\nYin within Yang forms shape,\nYang within Yin forms image.\nCirculating the Four Symbols,\ninterweaving the Five Phases.\n\n*Nurturing, like a person using Yang warmth to feed,\nunceasingly nourishing at the proper time.\nDependent upon the cauldron and tripod—\nthe *Qián*-*Kūn* cauldron.\nIts nature is spontaneous,\nthe dwelling of all true ones,\nlike Heaven and Earth’s covering and nourishing—\nthus it is said to be dependent.\n\n*Weighing the *zhū* and *liǎng* to determine the *xún*’s movement,\nexamining the trigrams’ symbols to measure the fire.\nWeighing *zhū* and *liǎng*: the use of scales.\nSixteen *liǎng* make one *jīn*—\nthree hundred eighty-four *zhū*.\nThe *xún*’s movement: ten days make a *xún*,\ncounting *xún*s completes a year’s cycle,\nthen it begins anew.\nExamining the trigrams’ symbols:\ndetailed in the sixty-four hexagrams’ lines,\ndividing the three hundred eighty-four *zhū*\nwithin the great medicine—\nfinally forming the Great Elixir.\nObserving symbols and numbers,\nharmonizing with Creation,\nmoving fire to completion.\n\n*As for the two solstices marking the seasons,\nYin and Yang alternate.\nThe two solstices: winter and summer solstices.\nYang begins at winter solstice,\nreigning until the fourth month.\nYin begins at summer solstice,\nreigning until the tenth month.\nThe cycle repeats.\nWinter solstice: Yang is born,\nsummer solstice: Yin is born—\nthus it is said to alternate.\n\n*At the end, *Kūn* is completed and *Gǒu* and *Dùn* emerge.\n*Term*: end.\n*Structure*: gathering.\n*Kūn*: the hexagram.\n*Gǒu* and *Dùn* enter from *Qián* into *Kūn*—\nsequential hexagrams.\nThe *Qián* hexagram is full in the fourth month,\ndeficient in the fifth—\nthen the *Kūn* hexagram takes effect from *Qián*.\n*Qián*’s six lines:\nthe first line splits into *Gǒu*—\nthe fifth-month hexagram, one Yin line born.\nThe second line splits into *Dùn*—\nthe sixth-month hexagram, two Yin lines born.\nThe third line splits into *Pǐ*—\nthe seventh-month hexagram, three Yin lines born.\"*\n\nThe fourth line splits into *Guān*, the eighth-month hexagram, with four Yin lines born.\nThe fifth line splits into *Bó*, the ninth-month hexagram, with five Yin lines born.\nThe top line splits to complete and terminate *Kūn*, the tenth-month hexagram, with all Yin lines pure.\n\nThus it is said that the *Zhì* (allocation) of the *Shì* (scholar-officials) follows the harmonious laws of the *Shàng* (upper) to flourish, and speaks of uniting with the eleventh month to circulate *Fire*.\n\n*Fù* begins and *Lín* exhausts *Qián*.\n*Fù*: beginning and end.\n*Lín* originates from *Kūn*, returning to *Qián*—this speaks of *Kūn* being complete in the tenth month, deficient in the eleventh.\nThe *Qián* hexagram takes effect from *Kūn*, with one Yang line born as *Fù*, the eleventh-month hexagram.\nThe second line moves to become *Lín*, the twelfth-month hexagram, with two Yang lines.\nThe third line moves to become *Tài*, the first-month hexagram, with three Yang lines born.\nThe fourth line moves to become *Dà Zhuàng*, the second-month hexagram, with four Yang lines born.\nThe fifth line moves to become *Yǒng*, the third-month hexagram, with five Yang lines born.\nThe sixth line moves and exhausts *Qián*—all pure Yang lines.\n\nThis speaks of circulating *Fire* from the winter solstice, reaching the summer solstice. The summer solstice is the tenth month, completing the year.\n\n*Lóng* flies, *Yuè* lies curved—upper and lower chords.\n*Lóng* is Yang *qi*.\nThe *Yì* says: \"The first nine, *Potential Dragon*—do not act.\"\nThe second nine, *Dragon Appears in the Field*—it ascends and flies.\nYang *qi* rises, hence it is said *Dragon* flies.\nThe rising Yang *qi* is the *Taiyang* (Greater Yang) *Rì* (Sun), moving from the *Zhōngqì* (central *qi*) at the *Tiānzhèng* (heavenly rectification) time.\nInitially, it follows the *Yíngdào* (full path), so Yang *qi* grows with the Sun.\nThe *Taiyang* Sun, as sovereign, and *Taiyin* Moon, as minister, follow their seasonal nodes.\nThe Moon lies curved, its body slanted—hence *Yuè* lies curved, with upper and lower chords.\n\nThe *Taiyin* Moon completes a celestial circuit in twenty-seven and a half days.\n*Fù* advances two and a half days, chasing the Sun to meet at *Hèzhuó* (new moon).\nThus, a month has thirty days.\nOn the third day, *Taiyin* first appears in the *Gēng* (regional division), and Yang *qi* stirs—*Wood* responds, hence the *Zhèn* hexagram receives *Gēng*.\n*Taiyin* advances five days—counting the prior three, eight evenings see it in the southern *Dīng* (direction), half-curved, gazing at the Sun, level as a bowstring—called the *upper chord*.\nThen Yin and Yang *qi* are still, and *Metal* responds—hence the *Duì* hexagram receives *Dīng*.\n*Taiyin* advances seven days—counting the prior eight, fifteen days see it in the *Shù* (direction) *Jiǎ* (stem), full and returning, facing the Sun, the peak *qi* stirring—*Metal* responds, hence the *Qián* hexagram receives *Jiǎ*.\nThe fifteen days prior belong to evening visibility—Yin within Yang *qi*.\n*Taiyin* advances three days—counting the prior, eighteen days see it in the morning at *Xīn* (stem), Yin *qi* still—*Wood* responds, hence the *Xùn* hexagram receives *Xīn*.\n*Taiyin* advances five days—counting the prior, twenty-three days see it in the morning at southern *Bǐng* (stem), half-curved, gazing at the Sun, level as a bowstring—the *lower chord*—Yang *qi* stirs, *Earth* responds, hence the *Gèn* hexagram receives *Bǐng*.\n*Taiyin* advances seven days—counting the prior, thirty days see it in the morning at *Yǐ* (stem), obscured and unclear, completing the peak Yin *qi*—*Kūn* responds, hence the *Kūn* hexagram receives *Yǐ*.\nThus it is said: *Yuè* lies curved, with upper and lower chords.\n\n*Huángjīn* (Yellow Gold), *Bái Hǔ* (White Tiger)—divine transformations of nature.\n*Huángjīn* is the *Wǔxíng* (Five Phases) forming *Earth*, internally containing *Metal*—hence *Yellow Gold*.\n*Bái Hǔ* is the *Zhēnyī* (True One) *Metal*.\nThe *Zhēnyī* is pure white, attaining the *Xīfāng* (Western) white hue.\nIf not true, it cannot divine and transform nature.\nFrom the two solstices to the seasonal markers, and the upper and lower chords—all speak of the *Dàdǐng* (Great Cauldron), where true *qi* transforms and contracts divinely, uniting *Kūn* within *Qián*.\n\nFuse *Kūn* and *Gèn* to form *Earth*.\n*Fú*: the meaning of casting.\n*Kūn* is *Gèn* *Earth*.\nAt the initial fusion, *Xùn* is *Wind*—fuse *Xùn* to form *Gèn*, fuse *Gèn* to form *Kūn*—this is from emptiness generating fullness.\n\nRaise *Qián* and *Duì* to form *Heaven*.\n*Yǎng*: law and symbol.\nTo emulate *Heaven*, initially *Zhèn* is *qi*—fuse *Zhèn* to form *Duì*, *Zhèn* coming to complete *Duì*—this is binding as *Metal*, fusing *Duì* to form *Qián*—thus raising it as *Heaven*.\n\n*Zǐ Mǔ* (Son-Mother) gratitude—*flying* and *dwelling*, hooked and linked.\nThe *Jīng* says: \"The eldest son inherits the father’s essence, relying on the mother to establish the foundation.\"\nThe eldest son is the *Zhèn* hexagram—*Zhèn* is the eldest male, *Kūn* is the aged mother.\nNow, fusing *Gèn* to form *Earth*, raising *Duì* to form *Heaven*—relying on the mother-son bond, nature’s inherent disposition, inheriting the father’s essence.\nThis is the *Earth* Yin lines, forming *Qián* from *Kūn*.\n*Flying* is the restless movement of Heaven’s Yang—hence *flying*.\n*Dwelling* is the settled yet unbounded nature of Earth’s Yin—hence *dwelling*.\nNow, with Heaven and Earth merged, this is *flying*, *dwelling*, *hooked*, and *linked*.\n\nOne encompasses *Three* and *Five*—*Water* agitates *Clouds* and *Mist*.\nAbove, the *Three* and *Five* principle is made clear; now it is further obscured.\nThe *Wèi Jūn* says:\n*\"Rooted in but two things,\nYet branching into Three and Five.\nThree and Five unite with One,\nCollectively responding to Two.\"*\n\nThe *Clouds* and *Mist* are true *qi*.\n*Water* is the number One, congealing and agitating to coalesce.\n*Water* One and *Fire* Two make Three.\nFive is *Earth*.\nSimilarity without separation—hence *One* encompasses.\n\nThe *Tài Yì* to *Tài Yáng* ode says:\n*\"The Sun is the essence of *Taiyang*,\nIts number is Nine—\nIn Heaven, it forms symbols;\nOn Earth, it forms shapes.\nIt harmonizes all things,\nDistributes *qi* to give life.\nWithin the Sun is *Wū*—\nCalled the Yin essence.\nYin and Yang interweave,\nSouls and spirits intertwine.\nThus *Lí* Fire, by its nine names,\nCondenses *qi* into *Jūyīng* (cinnabar),\nRefined through essence,\nCombining Three, Five, and One—\nThe Dragon arrives to welcome.\"*\n\nThe ancient *Xian* (immortals) refined the Sun’s *Jing* (essence),\nReturning their bodies to pure *Taiyang*,\nSoaring through *Taiqing*—\nThus it is said of their *Taiyang*,\nThat its number is Nine—\nFor the meaning is *One* encompassing Three and Five.\n\nAgain, Tao Hongjing extolled the Sun:\n*\"Know that *One* is the *Shu* (number) of *Water*,\nThe origin of the Five *Xing* (phases),\nIts hue drawn from the North,\nEncompassing the Five *Cai* (colors),\nRefined to accord with *Dao*,\nIts principle harmonizing with Nature.\n\n*Water* is the beginning of *Tai Xuan*,\nThe root of the *Dao*.\nWhen it serves as the pivot of Heaven and Earth,\nRefining and tempering Yin and Yang,\nIts work matches the creative transformation.\n\nThis is the *qi* of *One* encompassing—\nLike clouds or mist,\nAgitated and congealed into the principle of supreme medicine.\n\nIts *Lingye* (spirit-fluid) alters the essence of bones,\nTurning aged women back to youthful boys.\nA single grain of divine *Dan* (elixir)\nCan transform the old into the young.\nThe *Sutra* says:\n*\"When golden *Dan* enters the Five *Nèi* (inner organs),\nIt disperses like mist and wind-clouds.\nPerfuming and steeping the Four *Zhi* (limbs),\nIts hue radiant and pleasing.\nOld men regain their vigor,\nAged women become graceful maidens.\nChanging form to transcend worldly calamities,\nThey are called *Zhenren* (true persons).*\n\nObserving *Xing* (penalty) and *De* (virtue) in life and death,\nThe *Dao* aligns with ruler and subject.\n*Xing* and *De* are the *Dao* of rewards and punishments.\nThe *Sutra* states:\n*'Virtue* governs life—\nThe rise of *Spring*.\n*Penalty* governs suppression—\nThe harvest of *Autumn*.\nThe application of *Xing* and *De*\nIs the constitution of emperors and kings.\n\nTo govern with clear *Wangdao* (kingly Way),\nApplying *De* and *Xing*,\nIn accordance with the utmost fairness,\nThen the *Wangdao* flourishes and the world is at peace.\n\nNow, refining the Great *Dan*,\nAlso unites *Xing* and *De*—\nSpring and Autumn without discrepancy,\nThe *Lü* (music) and *Yù* (pitch-pipes) in order.\nHence, Li Zhenren’s *Dan* ode says:\n*\"When Yin and Yang are rectified,\nSouls and spirits interdepend,\nThe *Dao* of ruler and subject is complete,\nThe duty of husband and wife is fulfilled.\nSun and Moon have their measures,\nCold and heat do not overstep.\nThe *Huandan* (returning elixir) is thus formed,\nIts transformation unparalleled in spirit.*\n\n*Fēizhāng Zhūxià*—\n*Fēi* (soaring) is the *Zhūquè* (Vermilion Bird) of the Southern Fire *Guan*.\n*Zhāng* (extended) refers to the *Twenty-Eight Xu* (constellations) extending their stars.\n*Zhūxià* (Vermilion Summer) is the brilliance of Summer,\nTogether discussing the South.\n*Fùmǎo Zhōngchūn*—\n*Fù* (suppression) is the *Xingzhèng* (penalty-politics) of suppression.\n*Zhōngchūn* (mid-Spring) is the second month,\n*Mǎo* (Tiger) is Wood.\n*Water* and *Mercury* are greenish-black,\nServing as medicine and as the Dragon.\nIf Heaven and Earth follow the seasons of *Xing* and *De*,\nThen the Dragon of *Water* and *Mercury* naturally lies dormant.\n\nWhen the *Fāngxiàng* (hexagram) *Jiǔèr* (Nine-Two) reveals the Dragon,\n*The *Fāngxiàng* (hexagram) is *Jiǔèr* (Nine-Two),\nThe middle *Yáo* (line) of the lower *Qián* (hexagram).\nThe Dragon appears in the *Tián* (field),\nVirtue is universally applied.\nThe six *Yáo* (lines) of *Qián*:\nThe upper two lines are Heaven,\nThe lower two lines are Earth,\nThe middle two lines are Humanity.\nNow, the Dragon revealed in Nine-Two,\nIs the Earth’s line ascending.\nLike the *Tianzhēn* (Heavenly Truth) of *Taiyang* within the cauldron,\nEmerging from the Nine-Two Earth.\nIt generates and transforms all things,\nNone failing to benefit—\nThus virtue is universally applied.\nThe transformation of the divine *Dan* is the same.\n\n*Tǐng Èrbā Zhìshén*—\n*Tǐng* (upright) is growth.\n*Èrbā* (Eight-Two) refers to the double verification of *Qián* and *Kūn* within the cauldron,\nThe *Dao* of divine transformation.\n*Taiyang*’s *Yǎncè* (reclining and rising),\nThe two *Xián* (lines) of Eight-Two.\nHaving secured its position in the Southwest,\nPiercing through the North while standing alone.\nThe Southwest is the position of *Kūn* (Earth).\nNow, Earth has no fixed form,\nRelying on the *Wèi* (stems) of *Jīng* (Metal) and *Yī* (Wood).\nWhy is it green?\nThe Five *Xing* generate one another in sequence,\nMetal begets Water,\nWater begets Wood,\nWood begets Fire,\nFire begets Earth—\nThus *Kūn* Earth is beneath *Jīng* and *Yī*.\n\nPiercing through the North while standing alone—\nThe *Shù* (North) is the position of *Gèn* (Stopping),\n*Kūn* and *Gèn* are connected,\n*Gèn* is cessation.\nAll things encountering *Gèn* come to rest,\nThus Earth’s virtue is tranquil and unmoving,\nAnd all things also rest.\nThe *Yì* (classic) says:\n*'Obtaining companions in the Southwest,\nProceeds with its kind.\nLosing companions in the North,\nThe stability of *Yìng* is auspicious—\nResponding to Earth without excess.*\nAt that time, the *Héchē* (River Vehicle) ascends,\n*Yúshí* (until) is the moment,\nWhen the divine *Dan*’s work is complete.\nThe *Héchē* ascending—\nThe *Hé* (River) is the *Àihé Fánnǎo* (Love-River of Troubles),\nThe *Chē* (Vehicle) is the *Chuánchē* (Boat-Vehicle).\nIt says the divine *Dan* is now formed,\nObtaining the *Héchē* to cross the river.\n\nWhite and black alternate in clarity.\nWhite is the *Zhēnyī* (True Unity) of the *Sù* (substance),\nBlack is the *Xuányīng* (Dark-Mystery) of *Water*.\nAlternating is *Zhōu* (circulation),\nManifest is *Zhāng* (clarity).\nThe *Sutra* states:\n*\"Knowing White and holding Black,\nThe divine spirit arrives naturally.*\nThis means now the dust-net is crossed,\nKnowing White and holding Black without error,\nThe divine *Dan*’s work is complete and manifest.\n\n*Huǒxiāo Jīn ér shénqì bùbài*—\n*Huǒ* (fire) is the *Yùnhuǒ* (circulating fire).\nThe *Zhēnyī* (True Unity) of *Jīn* (Metal),\nYear after year, season after season,\nCirculating fire refines it—\nFire merely consumes,\nYet the divine *Dan*’s *qi* remains unvanquished.\n\n*Tǔkè Shuǐ ér xíngtǐ wúshāng*—\nThe ancient ode says:\n*'Earth can suppress Water and lie dormant,\nThe *Wénwǔ* (cultured and martial) follow the seasons—\nHeaven’s *Dao* flourishes.*\nThe *Wèijūn* (Prince of Wei) said:\n*'Suppression by *Taiyang*’s warmth,\nAnd mutual consumption.*\n*Fù* (suppression) is affinity.\nThe *Jing* (essences) of Dragon and Tiger\nLie dormant in *Wùjǐ* (Stems of Earth and Metal).\n*Wùjǐ* are the central hues.\nThey can rectify the Four *Fāng* (directions),\nAnd can lie dormant beneath *Water*.\nThus it is said:\n*Water* meets Earth and must perish—\nPerish is to lie dormant.\nHumans ingesting this medicine,\nAre moved and attain longevity.\n\nIndeed, the true *Qiān* (lead) of Heaven and Earth undergoes transformation,\nThis Earth of the Four *Xiàng* (symbols) *Wùjǐ*,\nThough it suppresses the *Xuányīng* (Dark-Mystery) of *Water*,\nYet causes no harm or injury.\nLongevity does not depart from the *Xuánsù* (Dark-Substance),\n*Xuán* (Dark) is the *Dānxuán* (Alchemy of Darkness),\n*Sù* (Substance) is the body of *Zhēnyī Bái Jīn Dān* (True Unity White Metal Elixir).\nThe *Sutra* says:\n*'Suppressing Fire, Mercury is formed,\nThe *Huandan* (returning elixir) is not false.*\nAgain it says:\n*'Suppression leads to longevity,\nThus it is not false.*\nAgain it says:\n*'The nature of Metal does not decay or rot,\nThus it is the treasure of all things.*\nThe *Shì* (scholar) *Kùn* (Kun) said:\n*'Ingesting Metal like Metal,\nIngesting Jade like Jade.\nThe *Shī* (lice) dwell in the head and turn black,\nThe *Shè* (musk deer) eat *Tóng* (mulberry) and become fragrant,\nThe nature of Mercury stains the body—\nAll follow this principle.*\"*\n\n*\"If one seeks the *Dan* of prolonged abiding,\nThen gradually one may attain *Zhēn* (True).\nLike plants in late winter,\nCovered they do not die,\nExposed they suffer harm.\nThus, ingesting Metal as Metal,\nIngesting Jade as Jade.\"*\n\nThe ascent and descent are both dependent upon the **Great Sun**.\n\nBy \"ascent and descent,\" it means the rising and falling of **yin** and **yang**.\n\nFrom the eleventh month to the fourth month, **yang qi** ascends while **yin qi** descends, and when **heaven** and **earth** unite, all things are born. Again, from the fifth to the tenth month, **yin qi** ascends while **yang qi** descends, and when **heaven** and **earth** invert, all things wither.\n\nThus, ascent and descent are both dependent upon the **Great Sun**.\n\nMoreover, the **Sun** is the **yang** of the day.\n\nWithin **heaven** and **earth**, among all phenomena, only **Earth** holds supreme authority, governing **yin** and **yang**, causing ascent and descent, generating all things, and reaching the marvels of **Divine Elixir**, attaining longevity and eternal life—all rely upon the **True God of the Wheel**, the **Supreme without Limit**, the result of **transformation**.\n\nThus, it is said that ascent and descent are dependent upon the **Great Sun**.\n\nWhy do the two luminaries radiate with five colors and emit fragrance?\n\nThe \"two luminaries\" refer to the **Sun** and **Moon**. It speaks of the **Sun** and **Moon** shining brightly, their light vast and luminous. **\"Radiate\"** means to suspend and emit light. It speaks of the **Sun** and **Moon** suspending and emitting great light, their five colors fragrant, transforming all things within **heaven** and **earth**.\n\nThe **Sun**, **Moon**, and Five Stars are not of constant hue; each responds to the **qi** of the four seasons, altering their colors. If in winter they display summer’s aspect, calamity will descend.\n\nThe *Sutra* says:\n*\"Since the opening of creation, the **Sun** and **Moon** have not waned, and the **golden** weight has not diminished. This is because **metal** and **wood** flourish within, while **water** and **fire** respond without. **Qian** remains vigorous and unceasing, thus its efficacy is achieved; the **Sun’s** hues do not flicker, thus it benefits **Zhen**.\"*\n\nOnly **heaven**, **earth**, the **Sun**, and **Moon** can endure and persist, aligning with the beginning and end of all things. The **Dragon** and **Tiger** unite, becoming the **Dao’s** supreme pivot, harmonizing with **heaven** and **earth**, conforming to the **numbers of yin and yang**, their **mysterious transformations** subtly responding—like connected pearls and matched jade—reaching the boundless.\n\nIn terms of refining the **Divine Elixir**, it encompasses **heaven** and **earth’s** **yin** and **yang**, the **Sun** and **Moon**, the **Dragon** and **Tiger**, the functions of the four seasons, the **qi** of the Five Phases, and the Five Stars in conjunction—**Sun** and **Moon** as matched jade—thus forming the **Great Elixir**.\n\nHence, it is said:\n*\"The two luminaries radiate, their five colors fragrant.\"*\n\nTheir **emotions** and **nature** unfold and depend upon each other, their **spirit** and **soul** alternate and conceal themselves.\n\nThis speaks of the **Divine Elixir** once formed, its **pottery** and **refinement** continuing unbroken. The **Dragon** represents **emotion**, the **Tiger** represents **nature**; the **Sun’s** **spirit**, the **Moon’s** **soul**. When the **Great Elixir** is complete, the **Dragon** and **Tiger** unfold and depend upon each other. A single grain of **Great Elixir** aligns with the **Sun**, aligns with the **Moon**, hence the alternation.\n\nThere exists a **Divine Chamber**, towering and majestic, where **mysterious** and **white** guard each other.\n\n**\"There\"** means **\"original.\"** The **Divine Chamber** refers to the **furnace**, **heaven** and **earth**, and the **human heart**.\n\nThe *Golden Splendor Sutra* says:\n*\"Refine within the **Divine Chamber** with **jing**—then the **Golden Elixir** will form. How could it not be firm?\"*\n\nThe **refining vessel** contains **qi** that gathers and condenses, opening and closing like empty doors—**Xi Yi’s** realm, the **造化**’s cavern, where **yang qi** stirs **Kun**. It also says:\n*\"The **heart** is the abode of **ling** (spirit), where **shen** (god) resides within it.\"*\nIt also says:\n*\"The **heart** resides in the abdomen, and ten thousand wisdoms arise.\nMedicine dwells in the **furnace**, and ten thousand transformations occur.\"*\n\nIt also says:\n*\"The **Divine Chamber** is the pivot of the **Elixir**, the parent of all stones.\"*\n\n**\"Towering\"** is like an unshaken mountain; **\"mysterious and white\"** have already been explained—**white** guards **black**, both residing within the **Divine Chamber** and **furnace**.\n\nIt **liquefies water and fire** to **congeal the Metal**.\n\n**\"Liquefy\"** refers to the **true qi**, **true water**, and **true fire** within the **furnace**—the **yin** and **yang qi**. Once external fire is applied, the **yin** and **yang** within the **furnace** steam like clouds and rain, water and fire both liquefying, **yin** and **yang** both moistening. When autumn’s chill and winter’s severity arrive, they naturally congeal—hence, **\"liquefy water and fire to congeal the Metal.\"** **\"Metal\"** refers to the **true Metal of Unity**.\n\n**\"Yao** and **ming**\" are the **furnace’s** **heaven** and **earth**; **heaven** and **earth** exist within **yao** and **ming**, and water and fire exist within **heaven** and **earth**—transformed by **true qi**.\n\nThus, it is said: **\"Liquefy water and fire to congeal the Metal.\"**\n\n**\"Facing yao and ming,\"** there is **being**.\n\n**\"Yao\"** is water, **\"ming\"** is fire, and there exists **true essence**—this is the **qi** of **empty mist**, forming **being**.\n\n**\"Radiant in crimson and purple,\"** it must be within **Qian** and **Kun**.\n\n**\"Radiant\"** refers to the **honored light** of crimson and purple—the **true color** of the **Great Elixir**.\n\n**Wei Jun** said:\n*\"The **Elixir** is when **cinnabar** transforms into **mercury**, **mercury** into **sand**, and **sand** into **Elixir**—hence, it is called **Returning Elixir**.\n*'Return'* means **reversion**. **Elixir** is the name for the **red** substance. **Mercury**’s original form is **Metal**; after becoming **sand**, it is called **Metal Sand**. When **purple-red** forms **Metal**, it returns to its original body—thus it is called **Great Returning Elixir**.\"*\n\nAn ancient song also says:\n*\"When the **Purple River’s chariot** arrives, **yellow gold** returns to my home.\"*\n\nIt also says:\n*\"Its color turns to purple—then it becomes **Elixir**.\"*\n\nWithin **heaven** and **earth** today, in the homes of emperors, they drag **Jú-lóu** in **crimson and purple** as symbols of honor—this is how the **Sage** modeled the **Dao** of the **Divine Elixir**.\n\n**\"Treading heaven and earth,\"** enduring forever.\n\n**\"Treading\"** means **wandering**. Wandering within **heaven** and **earth**, the four poles are not distant, the eight **huang**s are not vast—**body** aligns with **heaven** and **earth**, enduring forever; **Dao** aligns with the **Great Void**, without limit.\n\n**Wei Jun** said:\n*\"If there are those who transcend the **Void**, whose nature is harmonious, who see the world’s path as scalding water and abandon wife and child like discarding shoes, who perceive mortal life as fleeting and know the **Great Dao** endures—then this *Sutra* may be entrusted to them. Let them seek the ultimate truth, unconcerned with gain or loss, and refine it to completion.*\n\n*After completion, they will see rivers and seas as hills, regard human life as fleeting foam. Soaring beyond the **Great Void**, wandering in boundless freedom—this is not the work of **heaven** and **earth**, but the power of the **Returning Elixir**.\"*\n\nThis is the **secret essence** of the **Returning Elixir**, all transmitted by **immortals**.\n\nThe **secret essence**—the *Golden Splendor*, *Paramartha*, *Tai Yi*, and *Hun Yuan*—has already been explained. All are transmitted by **immortals**; their principles may be obscured.\n\n「Yet few are those who receive the instruction of the **immortals**, and only those who can truly grasp the **immortals’ Dao** will attain it.\n\nThus the *Mystic Threads* states: Those who study the **Dao of Immortality**, must first be endowed with the **yang-essence qi** of the divine. Without the **yang-essence qi** bestowed upon them, none would harbor a longing for the **Dao of Immortality**. Now, since one has devoted oneself entirely to loving the **Way** and seeking the **immortals**, there are none who do not possess the innate **immortal bone** within them.\n\nAgain, the *Treatise on the Learnability of Immortality* says: When one understands the origin of one’s **primordial life** and recognizes the dwelling of one’s **true qi**, one may cultivate the **Great Void** to purify and harmonize one’s nature, inhale and exhale, bend and stretch to regulate one’s body. By preserving the **high and subtle** and guarding one’s **fixed essence**, by using **elixirs** and **medicinal aids** to rectify and assist, one may achieve **complementary nourishment** of both **form** and **spirit**, transcending both—though not yet ascending to the heavens, I must still call them **immortals**.\n\nWhen one consumes the **elixir** and **bone** is transmuted into **gold**, **form** into **jade**, and **life** into **primordial life**, achieving **eternal longevity**—when one fasts and practices **virtue** to perfect **Dao and virtue**, the **Way** is employed through **emptiness and nothingness**, while **virtue** is named for **meritorious deeds**. The *Treatise on Nourishing Life* states: If one has **Dao** but lacks **virtue**, then **spirit** and **principle** will suffer ruin. If one has **virtue** but lacks **Dao**, then **nature** and **life** will perish early. None but those who **simultaneously cultivate Dao and virtue**, preserving **form** and **spirit**, blending the **Three Primordials**, and achieving **boundless longevity**—this is what is meant.\n\nSwiftly, one casts off the **worldly dust** like discarding a broken shoe, enduring as long as **heaven** and **earth**. Swiftly (*shūrán*) means **fleeting and sudden**; breaking a shoe (*zhǎn*) is to discard it. The **upper qi** of the **Great Elixir**—when a person consumes it, it surges upward like a bolt of lightning, casting aside the **worldly dust** as though discarding a broken shoe, and thus enduring as long as **heaven** and **earth**—this is the power of the **Great Elixir**.\n\nThe longevity of cranes and the years of tortoises may be likened to the swiftness of lightning and the whirl of wind; a mustard-seed city brushing against a stone may be likened to clouds dissolving and mists dispersing. **Master Tao of the Immortals** said: Though **heaven** and **earth** decay, I remain whole in **self**; though all phenomena perish, I preserve my **body**. These are metaphorical words to illustrate the **boundless** nature of the **Way**.\n\nThe **Most High** said: You may welcome it and not see its beginning, follow it and not see its end. Truly, this **sacred intent** reveals that the **Dao** has no limits.\n\nThus concludes the *Golden Elixir Ode* #1. The character **\"入\"** (*rù*) is supplemented according to the *Inner Elixir Ode of Master Tao*.」",

      "translated_text": "**The Preface to the *Essay on the Golden Elixir* (Jīndān Fù)**\n\nThe *Essay on the Golden Elixir* (Jīndān Fù) is a work titled by the disciple of the Dao, **Mǎ Zhāozhào**, who was likely a native of **Jīnqī** (金期).\n\nThis essay elucidates the *Essay on the Golden Elixir* (外丹說) composed by **Táo Zhízhēn Rén** (陶植真人), expanding upon its original text while clarifying the interpretations. It consists of **one volume**.\n\nThe source of this text is found in the **Dòngzhēn** (洞真) section of the *Zhèngtǒng Dàozàng* (正統道藏), under the **Methods** (方法) category.\n\n---\n\n**Preface to the *Essay on the Golden Elixir* (Jīndān Fù Xù)**\n\nI have heard that **life** (生) is the foundation of the **Dao/Way** (道), and only the **heaven and earth, sun and moon** (天地日月) endure eternally. **Teaching** (教) is the supreme expression of the **Dao/Way** (道), and it draws upon the **natural transformations of the cosmos** (造化自然而) to establish its principles.\n\nThe **Primordial Beginning** (元始) hung forth the **millet pearl** (黍珠), subtly expounding the **profound mysteries of the ultimate** (玄玄之義). The **Venerable Master Lao** (老君) ascended upon the **jade shoulder** (玉肩), proclaiming the **silent, tranquil school** (寂寂之宗). Thus, the name **\"Golden Elixir\"** (金丹) was established.\n\nTherefore, in the **Han Dynasty**, **Wèi Bóyáng** (魏伯陽) modeled his *Shēntóng Qì* (參同契) after the *Zhōuyì* (周易). From the **Jin, Tang, and Song dynasties onward**, scholars like **Xǔ Jǐngyáng** (許旌陽) and **Gě Zhìchuān** (葛稚川) reached the utmost heights of attainment, fulfilling the **Dao/Way** (道) in its entirety.\n\nThe disciple **Mǎ Zhāozhào** (馬莅昭), born under the heavens of earth and sky, secretly admires the **mysterious winds** (玄風) of the Dao. Though he lacks the **great path of non-action** (無為之路大辟), his efforts are but humble steps. Yet, the **gateways of myriad marvels** (眾妙之門) are vast, and he must tread with utmost caution.\n\nThanks to the **sage’s guidance** (聖人而推誘), his understanding has deepened, and he knows the **true virtue/power** (真德) of the Dao. Thus, he follows the **method** (隨方引汲) to seek its essence.\n\nHe dares to unfold these **wonderful classics** (妙典), though unworthy, to recite these **profound texts** (玄文). With a **heart as firm as iron** (堅似鐵之心), he carves into the **obstinate ore** (顽矿) of ignorance. With a **mind as vast as ashes** (旷如灰之志), he strives to **harmonize with the numinous root** (契靈根).\n\nHe reflects that **life is fleeting** (浮生), like **water droplets and wind-lit lamps** (水沫風燈), yet the **Dao/Way is eternal** (大道), as **heaven and earth endure** (天長地久). Still, **divine movement is ceaseless** (神運不息), and his **meditation is not refined** (研思岂精). To resolve his **private doubts** (私誠), he seeks no better means.\n\nOnce, while staying in a **traveler’s inn** (旅館), he was startled by the **autumnal cries of cicadas** (空驚秋), their echoes lingering through the night. Facing the **frost-lit lamp** (霜燈), he closed his scrolls in **melancholic concentration** (敛卷凝愁), nearly wounded by the **insects in the wall** (虫砌).\n\nBy chance, he encountered the *Essay on the Golden Elixir* (金丹赋), though he knew not its author. Often reciting this work, he found that his **depressed spirit was uplifted** (自镯其抑). Each time he finished, he would **embrace his knees and lift his head** (抱膝昂首), as if **the Dao had no room to contain him** (顯無所容哉).\n\nYet the **formulas are not arbitrary** (決不辄造), nor the **principles mere speculation** (理不虛拟). They are the **sage’s profound sincerity** (乃聖人之深誠). Truly, my own **stupidity and negligence** (愚是率耽) make it difficult to **grasp the text in full** (難閱具思). Still, I hope to **wander in my mind through subtle principles** (游心妙理), gradually approaching the **true depths of the Dao** (漸迹於真奥之中).\n\nI fear that my **presumptuous attempts** (冒訑筹之科) may be **unworthy of the sage’s teachings** (自責僭瑜之極). Therefore, I **reverently preserve** (謹藏筐筐) this work and **devoutly await the sage’s arrival** (虔候至人), studying it deeply within my heart. I venture to annotate it, though unqualified.\n\n---\n\n**The *Essay on the Golden Elixir* (Jīndān Fù)**\nAnnotated by the **Disciple of the Great Dao** (大道弟子), **Mǎ Zhāozhào** (馬莅昭)",

      "translated_text": "The **Essay on the Golden Elixir** (金丹赋)\n\n---\n\nWhen the **Dao/Way** (道) is **self-complete** (自成), the sage’s mind is **vast and boundless** (冲邈), containing **illumination and purity** (含亮蛉神), subtly hinting at what is yet to be spoken—hence the saying, *\"The Dao/Way\"* (夫也). The **Dao/Way** (道者) is the **origin of the primordial void** (虚元混成之本). The **Supreme Sage** (太上) said:\n\n*\"There exists a substance, mixed and complete (混成), born before Heaven and Earth (先天地生).\nSilent and vast (寂兮寥兮), it stands alone yet never changes (独立而不改),\ncirculates endlessly yet never falters (周行而不殆).\nIt can be called the **Mother of all things** (可以为天下母).\nI do not know its name (吾不知其名),\nso I call it the **Dao/Way** (字之日道).\nI might also call it **Great** (强谓之日大).\"*\n\nThis reveals that the **Great Dao/Way** (大道) arises from the **primordial void** (太虚), in the **silent and boundless realm** (寂寥之境), transforming into **one breath of *qi*** (生化一气), and then **separating into yin and yang** (分阴阳), establishing **Heaven and Earth** (立天地), and **cycling through the four seasons** (运四时), to **endlessly vary and give rise to all things** (以变有万物). Hence it is said:\n\n*\"Before Heaven and Earth were formed, it was the **Mother of all things** (先於天地之前，为万物之母).\"*\n\nAgain, the **Treatise on the Mysterious Thread** (《玄纲论》) says:\n\n*\"The **Dao/Way** (道者) is the **thread of the primordial void** (虚元之系), the **root of transformation and creation** (造化之根), the **source of divine intelligence** (神明之本), and the **origin of Heaven and Earth** (天地之源).\"*\n\nThis sufficiently clarifies that **Heaven, Earth, and all things** (天地万物) are **contained within *qi*** (含气), possessing **sentience, form, and color** (有识有象有色). All matters of **classification and correspondence** (触类之事) are **endlessly transformed by *qi*** (展转变化无穷), all arising from the **Dao/Way** (皆自道生也).\n\n**Nature** (自然者) refers to the time when the **mixed and complete primordial substance** (混元未辟) had not yet **manifested** (之时), when the **vast and empty cosmos** (寥廓太空) had no boundaries (莫有其际). When the **void reached its utmost** (虚极) and **spontaneously gave rise to *qi*** (自有神), that *qi* was the **most profound and spiritual essence of emptiness** (空之洞至灵者也). Hence, *qi* **moves and transforms**, giving rise to **clear and turbid distinctions** (化气，气分而立清浊之象), and **form** (象设) brings forth the **shapes of all things** (万物化形). The **clear and turbid distinctions** (清浊) and the **shapes of all things** (象形) all originate from the **primordial void** (虚元), yet **who could claim to be their sovereign creator** (岂有主宰制作而为)? This is the **principle that only the enlightened may know** (然之理而知不).\n\nThe **Sage** (圣人), observing that **Heaven, Earth, and all things** (天地万物) **transform and arise spontaneously** (变化之时自), thus called it **Nature** (故日自然). Therefore, one may **contrary to habit** (可违故) yet **follow its principle** (因而制之).\n\nTo **follow its principle** (制之者), one **models the breath of *qi*** (模范一气), **takes the pattern of the two polarities** (取法二仪), and **grasp the subtleties of Nature** (得自然之妙), thereby **attaining longevity and transcendence** (以至长生羽化). How could this be achieved by **merely extending techniques and applications** (法衍作用)? It is **securing the essence of the ultimate truth in Nature** (是得至真自然之理). Thus, it aligns with **Heaven, Earth, the sun and moon**, and **endures eternally** (与天地日月而长久), **remaining perpetually in its natural state** (而常自然而然之). If one **forcibly alters this** (若强然之), then it **will not be natural** (则不然也).\n\nHence, **human beings follow Earth** (人法地), **Earth follows Heaven** (地法天), **Heaven follows the Dao/Way** (天法道), and **the Dao/Way follows Nature** (道法自然).\n\nThe **method** (术) discerns **true and false** (明真假), residing in the **mind as principle** (在心日衍), which **extends into action** (衍作也). When one seeks to **extend and act** (欲衍作之时), one must first **illuminate the principle of the Great Dao/Way** (先大道之理). Having **clarified that the Great Dao/Way originates from the primordial void** (既明大道自虚元太空), and **possesses the root of elemental division** (而有根元分化处所), the **Sage** (圣人) **faces the mixed and complete source of all things** (向混成万物之中), **gazing upward at celestial patterns** (仰观天文), **looking downward at terrestrial formations** (俯察地理), **tracking the movements of stars and constellations** (历象星辰), **the sun and moon** (日月), **exhausting the origins of the four seasons** (穷四时之由), **fathoming the essence of the five phases** (极五行之义), and **establishing the foundation of metal and wood** (而定金木水火), **correlating the symbols of dragon, tiger, tortoise, and bird** (配象龙虎龟雀), **and clarifying the principles of mutual generation, mutual restraint, repose, and dominion** (而明相生相克休王之所), **thus drawing the eight trigrams and nine palaces** (画八卦九官), **completing the patterns of the cosmos** (成天下之文), **extreme in the symbols of mutual generation** (极相生之象), and **teaching the scholar to understand, penetrate its transformations, and exhaust its numbers** (使学者明之，达其变，极其数), **before extending and acting** (然后以衍而作也).\n\n**True and false** (真假者) **are intertwined and arise together** (相混而成也). When **one breath of *qi*** (一气) gives rise to **all things** (而生万物), within **all things** (万物之中), each **bears its own true and false** (各负真假). Yet **what arises from the Dao/Way is not false** (且何者不从道生)? Since all things **arise from the Dao/Way** (既皆从道生), then **all things are without true and false** (则万物无有真假). The **Dao/Way** (夫道者) **permeates the body of non-action** (体贯无为), **embracing Heaven and Earth yet not being great** (包天地不为大), **entering the finest dust yet not being small** (入微尘不为小), **having no favorites nor exclusions** (无亲无疏), **no ugliness nor beauty** (无丑无好), **and being beyond harm** (不可得而害)—how could it **possess true and false** (岂有真假哉)?\n\nYet, when **all things** (万物) **gain benefit or harm from a thing** (於物得利而亲好者), it is called **true** (曰真). When **all things** (万物) **gain harm or aversion from a thing** (於物得害而疏), it is called **false** (丑者日假). The **affection and aversion, benefit and harm** (亲疏丑好，利害) of all things **are all attached to their own nature** (万物皆各有所附). Since each has **its own attachment** (既各有所附), then **desires arise and one becomes immersed in them** (则欲於所欲，而溺於欲而深矣，确矣). Who could **cast aside narrow constraints** (豁廓襟抱), **explore the mysteries beyond form and *qi*** (探妙於形神之外), and **merge with the source of true and false** (混彼真假), **entering the origin of profound meanings** (倪入希义之源) in this way?\n\nNow, with my **stupidity and confusion** (愚迷), I say:\n\n*\"True and false are **Heaven and Earth** (天地), **yin and yang, water and fire** (阴阳水火), **cold and heat** (寒暑), **day and night** (昼夜), **hardness and softness** (刚柔). Yet **Heaven and Earth, yin and yang, water and fire, day and night, hardness and softness** (天地阴阳水火，昼夜刚柔) are all **distinct** (殊矣), yet in relation to the **Dao/Way** (於道), how could they be **different** (岂有异哉)?\n\nHence, **the non-existent generates the existent** (有无相生), **the long and short define each other** (长短相形), **the high and low incline toward each other** (高下相倾), **the difficult and easy complement each other** (难易相成), **sounds harmonize** (音声相和), **and the past and future follow in sequence** (前后相随). Therefore, **all things originally have no falsehood** (万物本无其假), yet **falsehood arises from the true** (假则因真而有假). **All things originally have no truth** (万物本无其真), yet **truth arises from the false** (因假而有真). Just as **yin and yang generate each other** (阴阳相生), **cold and heat oppose each other** (寒暑相反).\n\nHence, **the false contains the true** (假叉有真), and **the true depends on the false** (真叉因假). If one **seeks jade while rejecting stone** (离石求玉), **seeks the high while rejecting the low** (离下求高), **discards night to seek dawn** (弃夜求晨), or **discards the false to seek the true** (弃假求真), then **the true will have no existence** (真无有是也). Thus, one **first speaks of Nature** (故先言自然), then **addresses true and false** (后办真假).\n\nThe **method** (法) is based on the **two polarities** (则两仪). The **method** (法者) is the **extension of principle to its utmost** (衍斯至而为法), **and the illumination of that principle to its extreme** (明斯极而有则). The **two polarities** (两仪者) are **Heaven and Earth** (天地也). To **establish the method of Heaven and Earth** (制之以法天地) is to **set up the tripod and crucible** (而立鼎器).\n\nTo **follow the two polarities** (则阴阳) is to **cycle through the four seasons** (而运四时), so that **the *qi* transforms within the furnace and crucible** (使化气於炉鼎之中), **and the Dao’s *qi* circulates, mirroring Heaven and Earth** (周道气而行天地). The **Classic** (经) says:\n\n*\"Residing in the center to govern the outer\"* (处中以制外). Hence, it **depends on calendrical records** (故在於历纪). This means that within the **Great Elixir’s furnace and crucible** (大丹於炉鼎之内), the **center holds the laws of time** (中含律历), the **outer governs the records of Heaven and Earth** (外制天地之纪), and **binds the essence of the ultimate truth** (结至真之精). One cannot **fail to clarify the numbers of transformation and creation** (不可不明造化之数), **and seize the authority of Heaven and Earth** (夺天地之权), to **attain the method of complete transformation** (以至化成之道乎). Hence, the **method is based on the two polarities** (故言法则两仪也).\n\nTaking the **symbols of the eight trigrams** (取象八卦). To **take the symbols of the eight trigrams** (取八卦之象). The **Book of Changes** (《易》) says:\n\n*\"The **trigrams** (卦者) are **what is hung** (言乎挂者也).\nThe **symbols** (象日) are **what is represented** (言乎象者也), **as if suspending images of things** (言如悬挂物像), **to demonstrate them to people** (以示於人), hence they are called **trigrams and symbols** (故以卦象而称也).\"*\n\n**In Heaven, symbols are formed** (夫在天成象), **in Earth, shapes are formed** (在地成形), and **transformation and manifestation are evident** (变化见矣). Hence, the **Sage** (圣人) **gazes upward, following Heaven’s method to grasp symbols** (仰法天而取象), **looks downward, observing Earth’s shapes** (俯於地而察形), **and sings of the subtle essence of Heaven’s origin** (歌晓天元之微), **drawing the eight trigrams** (画八卦).",

Therefore, I **reverently preserve** (謹藏筐筐) this work and **devoutly await the sage’s arrival** (虔候至人), studying it deeply within my heart.

It represents **Heaven** (天), **Metal** (金), **the Sovereign** (君), and **the Father** (父). Its position is in the **west-north**, facing **Kūn** (坤) to complete the union of **Heaven and Earth** (合天地).\n\n**Kūn** (坤) consists of three short lines, the **pure yin** (纯阴) **stem** (爻). It represents **Earth** (地), **Soil** (土), **the Minister** (臣), and **the Mother** (母). Its position is in the **west-south**. Since it is generated by **Fire** (火), its place is paired with **Gāo** (离) in the **comparative** (比) position.\n\n**Zhèn** (震) has two short lines above and one long line below, the **two yin, one yang** (二阴一阳) **stem** (爻). It represents **Thunder** (雷), **Wood** (木), **the Eldest Son** (长男), and **the Azure Dragon** (青龙).

It represents **Wind** (风), **Wood** (木), and **the Eldest Daughter** (长女). Its position is in the **south-east**, and it issues **commands and orders** (行号令).\n\n**Kǎn** (坎) has two short lines above and below, with one long line in the middle, the **two yin, one yang** (二阴一阳) **stem** (爻). It represents **Water** (水), **the Moon** (月), **the Dark Tortoise** (玄武), and **the Middle Son** (中男). Its position is in the **north**, with one yang emerging between two yin, hence on the **eleventh month**, the **Winter Solstice** (冬至), **yang qi** (阳气) arises beneath the Earth. It faces **Gāo** (离) to complete the union of **Heaven and Earth** (合天地).\n\n**Gāo** (离) has two long lines above and below, with one short line in the middle, the **two yang, one yin** (二阳一阴) **stem** (爻). It represents **Fire** (火), **the Sun** (日), **the Vermilion Bird** (朱雀), and **the Middle Daughter** (中女). Its position is in the **south**, as the **heart of Heaven** (天之心), with one yin emerging between two yang, hence on the **fifth month**, the **Summer Solstice** (夏至), at **high noon** (停午), the **yin qi** (阴气) descends from above.\n\n**Gèn** (艮) has one long line above and two short lines below, the **one yang, two yin** (一阳二阴) **stem** (爻). It represents **Mountain** (山), **Soil** (土), and **the Youngest Son** (少男). All things encountering **Gèn** (艮) come to a halt. Its position is in the **north-east**, facing **Duì** (兑) to complete **Kàn and Kūn** (合乾坤).\n\n**Duì** (兑) has one short line above and two long lines below, the **one yin, two yang** (一阴二阳) **stem** (爻). It represents **Marsh** (泽), **Metal** (金), **the White Tiger** (白虎), and **the Youngest Daughter** (少女). Its position is in the **west**, and it serves as the **moon’s cavity** (月窟).\n\nNow, **Kàn** (乾) and **Kūn** (坤) are both **pure yang and pure yin** (纯阳纯阴) **trigrams**, hence they are **extreme** (极) and represent **Heaven and Earth** (为天地). **Xùn** (巽), **Gāo** (离), and **Duì** (兑) are all **two yang, one yin** (二阳一阴) **trigrams**, hence they all represent **female** (为女). **Zhèn** (震), **Kǎn** (坎), and **Gèn** (艮) are all **two yin, one yang** (二阴一阳) **trigrams**, hence they all represent **male** (为男). Why so? Because when **yin is predominant and yang is scarce**, **yang is the master** (阳为主). When **yang is predominant and yin is scarce**, **yin is the master** (阴为主). In all cases, the **minor** (少) is what the **major** (多) holds dear, and the **one** (一) is what the **many** (众) revere. Thus, the **minor** is the **precious** (多之所贵), and the **one** is the **honored** (众之所尊).\n\nThe **stems** (爻) of **Kàn** (乾) and **Kūn** (坤) are both **pure yin and yang** (纯阴阳), lacking **centrality** (中) and **non-centrality** (不中). **Zhèn** (震) and **Gèn** (艮) each have **two yin, one yang** (二阴一阳), yet the **one yang does not occupy the center** (不得其中). **Xùn** (巽) and **Duì** (兑) each have **two yang, one yin** (二阳一阴), yet the **one yin does not occupy the center** (不得其中). Whenever **yin and yang do not occupy their proper center**, though they may undergo **transformation and change** (变化), they cannot **harmonize** (通). Hence, **Kǎn** (坎) and **Gāo** (离) each have one yang and one yin respectively, both residing in the **center of yin and yang** (居阴阳之中), thus enabling **Heaven and Earth to communicate and return** (通天地还返).\n\nTherefore, when **following the Dao of the Two Principles** (法二仪之时), one must **take the symbols from the Eight Trigrams** (取象於八卦).\n\n**Dividing Heaven and Earth** (辟天地) to establish distinctions—**dividing** (辟) means **opening** (开). Within the **chaotic Primordium** (混元), there exists the **True Spirit** (真神), which **circulates the One Qi** (运一气) and **divides Heaven and Earth** (辟天地). Once **Heaven and Earth are divided**, they **cover and load** (圆覆方载), bringing forth **warmth and cold, chill and heat** (暄凉寒暑). **Metal, Wood, Water, and Fire** (金木水火) each return to their proper domains. The **distinctions within Heaven and Earth’s transformations** (区分天地之内变化之事) endure through **kalpas** (历劫), as a constant. Therefore, the **Sage** (圣人) **establishes the Dao and instructs people**, pointing to this **Primordial division and distinction** (混元开辟，区分之象).\n\nNow, those who **cultivate the Great Elixir** (修大丹) seek the **profound and mysterious meaning** (玄奥之义). Hence, the **Highest Lord** (太上) says:\n\n*\"How vast is the Great Thing beneath Heaven!

      "translated_text": "「The forms of **Kàn and Kūn** (乾坤) resemble the **symbol of the rooster and the fourth watch** (鸡卯之象), hence the **Classics** (经) say:\n\n*\"A rounded, high peak arises from the center,\nIts shape like a **blue-black gourd** (蓬壶).\"*\n\nIt is also said:\n\n*\"It resembles a **hen’s egg** (鸡子),\nWhere **yellow** (黄) and **white** (白) **mutually support** (相扶),\nThe **dense mists** (须蒙) must be **solid and integrated** (密固济) to achieve this.\"*\n\nIn the **hen’s egg** (鸡卯), the **yellow** (黄) is within, while the **white** (白) surrounds it. During the **embryonic state** (抱伏), it receives the **warm qi of the mother** (母暖气), and after **twenty-four days** (二十四日), it transforms into **eyes, beak, claws, and feet** (赀眼爪脚), as well as **plumage and patterned feathers** (毛羽文彩). This is the **True Qi’s spontaneous transformation** (得真自然而化)—how extraordinary!\n\nThus, the **yellow and white mutually support** (黄白相扶),\nAnd **solidly coalesce** (铃然而成).\n\nThe **fourth watch** (卯) must not be **blooded** (血)—if **blooded** (血), the **True Qi** (真之气) will scatter, and the transformation will naturally fail.\n\nIt is also said:\n\n*\"The forms of **Kàn and Kūn** (乾坤) resemble a **human head** (人首).\"*\n\nThe **Classics** (经) state:\n\n*\"The head resembles a **blue-black gourd** (蓬壶).\"*\n\nAnother **Classic** (经) says:\n\n*\"The **brain** (脑) is the **soul’s sacred altar** (灵宗), the **cavern of life’s essence** (百神之命窟), the **source of fluids** (津液之山源), and the **refined essence of the Golden Elixir** (金泥之精魂). Thus, the **stomach pool** (胃池) maintains its **rectangular form** (体方) to receive nourishment, while the **brain chamber** (脑官) remains **rounded and void** (圆虚) to offer the **True Qi** (真). With **ten thousand orifices planted** (万穴植立) and **thousand pores generating mist** (千孔生烟), its **virtue/power** (德) is **complete as heaven and earth** (备天地), and its **Dao/Way** (道) aligns with the **Great Mystery** (太玄). Therefore, it is named **Hun Yuan** (混元, *Mingled Primordial*).\n\nThe **Daniwan** (泥丸) is the **upper spirit of the physical form** (形躯之上神). By **positioning** (以位), it means that to cultivate this **Great Elixir** (大丹), one must first recognize the **forms and symbols of the rooster and the fourth watch, and the brain chamber** (鸡卯脑官二种形像), whose **method resembles Kàn and Kūn** (法似乾坤), and then **establish the crucible** (而立鼎器) and **circulate its Qi to determine its placement** (运而为其位).\n\nIt is also said:\n\n*\"The **gateway of the *Yì* (易)** is the **parental origin of all Trigrams** (众卦之父母). It corresponds to the **south and north** (南北), with **taking and releasing** (取舍) in kind. By **kind** (类), it means **analogous in form and essence** (比类体同). The **south and north** (南北) are the **directions of Great Yin and Great Yang** (太阴太阳), the **positions of the Elixir’s Dark and True aspects** (丹玄丹真), and the **Trigram of Kǎn and Lí** (坎陷离丽). **Taking** (取) refers to **Kǎn’s high and rising Qi** (坎高), while **releasing** (拾) denotes **Lí’s luminous and descending Qi** (离丽). When **Kǎn’s high and Lí’s luminous Qi merge** (坎高相合), they form **heaven and earth** (天地). The **Qi of the two Trigrams intermingles** (二卦气交), and thus **one takes, one releases** (一取一拾). When the **favorable day arrives, one takes** (得善日取), and when it departs, one releases (失善日拾). This meaning is **profound and subtle** (义幽隐), beyond what **written words** (翰简) can fully convey. To understand its **origin** (由), one must **penetrate the subtle essence of the two Trigrams** (洞晓二卦之微). Only then can one **exhaust the meaning of taking and releasing** (穷取拾之义) and grasp the **mystery of the human crucible** (人鼎器之妙).\n\nThe **Daniwan** (氏房) **leaps and dances within the Azure Dragon** (腾跃於苍龙). The **Daniwan** (氏房) are the **stars of the Twenty-Eight Lunar Mansions** (二十八宿) in the **northwestern quadrant** (束方). **Azure** (苍) refers to **green** (青), and **Dragon** (龙) signifies the **Qi of the northwestern quadrant** (束方之气). The *Zhōuyì Zhōng Zhèngyì* (周易中正义) states: *\"The Dragon can transform, and the Yang Qi can also transform, hence it is called **Dragon Qi** (龙气).\"* When the **eastern quadrant’s myriad trees flourish** (东方万木荣生), the **green and azure Qi** (青苍之气) is at its peak. Therefore, when **refining the Elixir with Fire** (运火修丹), by the **second month of spring** (仲春之月), the **True Qi** (真气) within the **Great Crucible** (大鼎) reaches its height, mirroring the **Azure Dragon’s leaping and dancing within the northwestern quadrant** (苍龙腾跃束方). The **Daniwan stars tremble and respond** (氏房之星摇动), hence the **Wei Lord’s ode** (魏君歌) says:\n\n*\"The Azure Dragon dwells in the **Daniwan** (房) of the sixth mansion,\nSpring’s radiance **shakes the northwestern quadrant** (震束卯).\"*\n\nThe **wings spread and the belt connects to the White Horse** (翼张襟带於白马). **Wings spread** (翼张) refers to the **stars of the Twenty-Eight Lunar Mansions in the southern quadrant** (二十八宿南方之星). **Belt and sash** (襟带) means **interconnected** (通连). The **White Horse** (白马) is the **guests of the first-grade Great Elixir** (初品大丹之客). The *Huáinán Zǐ* (淮南子) says: *\"The White Horse’s **teeth** (牙) love **cinnabar** (丹砂).\"* **White** (白) is the **color of the west** (西方色), and **Horse** (马) is the **beast of the south** (南方兽). **Teeth** (牙) refer to the **substance of the Elixir** (丹之物). It is also said that the **Daniwan spreads its wings, the Azure Dragon connects its belt** (氏房张翼苍龙), all **interconnected** (皆襟带通连)—the **southern beasts**, the **western white**, when **refining the Elixir with Fire** (运火修炼), reach this stage and thus form the **first-grade Great Elixir** (初品大丹).\n\nOne must **consolidate the essence and substance of Kàn and Kūn** (固乾坤之形质). **Consolidate** (固) means **to secure firmly** (牢固). Those who **master the techniques of refinement** (制赋之士) speak of this with **grave seriousness** (郑重). Indeed, **Kàn and Kūn are the crucible** (乾坤鼎), likened to the **hen’s egg** (喻如鸡卯). If **blooded** (若血), the **embryonic state will not yield True Qi** (抱伏不成真). If the **crucible is loose** (鼎疏), the **transformative Qi will disperse beyond heaven and earth** (化气流散天地之外), and its **core will be lost** (中失造化之本). For those who **craft the Divine Elixir** (作神丹), the **meaning of consolidation** (固际之义) is indeed profound. In these words, if one does not **exhaust the mysteries of the spirits and know the transformations** (穷神知化), how could they **grasp the meaning of consolidation** (明固际之义)?\n\nTo **consolidate the essence of Kàn and Kūn** (固乾坤之质) is neither **to fixate through consolidation** (非以固际之功而固) nor **to neglect consolidation** (非不以固际之功而固). Why? Because **Kàn and Kūn are natural** (乾坤自然), not something to be **consolidated**. If one does not **consolidate**, then **Kàn and Kūn will be destroyed**, and **heaven will tilt while earth collapses** (天倾地沦).\n\nOne must **shed the flesh and bones, becoming effortlessly refined** (脱肌肉而潇洒). **Shedding the flesh** (脱肌) means **liberation** (解脱). **Flesh and bones** (肌肉) are synonymous here. **Effortlessly refined** (潇洒) signifies **serene clarity and emptiness** (澄静清虚), **without attachment or obstruction** (无亲无挠). The **Song of the Five Elements in the *Yì*** (太易至五行歌) states:\n\n*\"What need for **metal, wood, water, fire, and earth** (金木水火土)?\nHold fast to **soul and spirit** (留神宝命), for they are the **Dragon and Tiger** (龙虎).\nScholars who fail to recognize the **Five Elements’ essence** (五行精),\nForcefully claim others’ **Five Elements as parents** (他人为父母).\n**Wood governs Qi** (木主气), **bones govern metal** (骨主金),\n**Blood mirrors water** (血象水), **flesh mirrors earth** (肉象土).\nThe **Dao of immortality** (不死之道) lies in **transformation and change** (变化也).\n**Follow the Dao’s timing** (顺天时) and **revere the Dao’s cycles** (奉天).\"*\n\n**Follow** (顺) means **not to contravene its timing** (不悖其时). To **contravene its timing** (逆其时) invites **calamity and harm** (钟灾害), while **aligning with its order** (顺其序) brings **blessings and auspiciousness** (降嘉祥). The **Classics** (经) say:\n\n*\"The **Five Qi** (五气) **follow their natural sequence** (顺序), **responding to the times** (应时) and thus **achieving harmony** (而得).\"*\n\nIt is also said:\n\n*\"Like a charioteer holding the **reins** (街辔),\nMeasuring against the **plumb line and ink line** (绳墨),\nFollowing the **tracks and wheel ruts** (轨辙).\n**Centered to govern the periphery** (处中以制外),\nThis is **found in the calendrical records** (故在於历纪).\"*\n\nThis speaks of those who **control Fire** (御火之士), like a **charioteer guiding the reins** (执衔辔), making the **horses and chariots obedient to their path** (车马驯其轨辙) without deviation. They **harmonize with the four seasons, eight nodes, twenty-four Qi, and seventy-two solar terms** (四时八节，二十四气，七十二侯).\n\n**Revere the Dao’s cycles** (奉天) is as the *Yì* (易) says:\n\n*\"Act before heaven, and heaven will not resist.\nAct after heaven, and you will **revere the Dao’s timing** (奉天时).\"*\n\nIf **heaven itself does not resist** (天且弗违), how much more so for **humans** (人)? This clarifies that once the **Great Elixir is formed** (大丹既成), its **procreative forces generate ceaselessly** (孳引相生), like **acting after heaven and revering the Dao’s timing** (后天而奉天时), nurturing **ancestors through descendants** (子孙而养父母), ensuring its **enduring legacy across ages** (历亿不绝).\n\nOne must **pair the female and male** (必雌雄而配偶). The **Classics** (经) say:\n\n*\"Yang does not stand alone, Yin does not dwell alone.\nThe **Dark Tortoise and the Black Dragon** (玄武) **coil and lean to support each other** (盘斜相扶).\nThis illustrates **female and male** (牝牡), **each requiring the other** (竟当相须).\"*\n\nThus, **female and male** (雌雄) refer to **Yin and Yang** (阴阳). **Kǎn’s male aspect** (坎男) is **Yang** (雄), and **Lí’s female aspect** (离女) is **Yin** (雌).",

tradition** (常流),\nascending from the **common to the sacred** (自凡入圣).\nThus, they are called **those who transcend the material** (物外者).\n\nMost people **cling to desires through material attachments** (因物以生欲),\n**drowning in the physical world** (溺於物).\nTo **drown in the material** (溺於物) is to be **entangled in the dusty net of mundane life** (拘於尘网).\nIf one **does not cultivate nor desire** (不营不欲),\n**has no concerns nor attachments** (无虑无拘),\nthen one is said to **transcend the material** (物外).\n\nThe **Classics** (经) say:\n*\"To transcend the world is to possess the world;\nto transcend the self is to preserve the self.\"*\n\nThe **material** (物) can **sustain life** (资身) as well as **destroy it** (灭身).\nThus, **those who pursue the True** (修真之士)\n**empty themselves and forget their form** (虚己忘形),\n**nourishing life** (资於生) while **avoiding its decay** (避其息).\nIf one **achieves fame and success** (功成名遂) yet **remains immersed without measure** (溺而无数),\nwhat wisdom is there in this?\n\nYet **those who transcend the material** (物外人) **do exist** (爰有).\nBy **nature, they inherit the Dao’s pristine essence** (性禀天真).\n**True** (真) is the **manifestation of the Dao** (道之纪).\n**Master Zhēn of Wú** (吴真人) said:\n*\"The spirit **inherits the Dao** (神禀於道),\n**stillness aligns with nature** (静而合乎性).\nHumans **inherit the spirit** (人禀於神),\n**action aligns with sentiment** (动而合乎情).*\nThus, **following nature** (率性) makes the spirit **concentrated and discerning** (神凝而察),\n**attaining the Dao’s pristine essence** (天真).\nBut **indulging in sentiment** (为情) makes the spirit **disturbed and impure** (神挠),\n**inviting perverse qi** (邪气自袭).\n\nTherefore, **sentiment disturbs the spirit** (情动神浊),\n**nature stills the spirit** (性静神清).\n**Clarity** (清) allows one to **enter the wondrous gate** (参入妙门),\n**grasp the Dao’s pristine essence** (得天真之理),\nand **keep the spirit within** (神监於内).\nHence, it is said that **nature inherits the Dao’s pristine essence** (性禀天真).\n\n**Embrace the harmonious will and qi** (抱冲和之志气).\n**Embrace** (抱) means **to nurture** (蕴).\n**Harmonious** (冲和) is the **balanced qi of heaven and earth** (天地中庸之气).\nThe **pure Yang of heaven** (天之纯阳) is **radiant and vast** (赫赫),\nthe **pure Yin of earth** (地之纯阴) is **dark and profound** (冥冥).\nIf **pure Yang resides above** (纯阳在上)\nand **pure Yin dwells below** (纯阴居下),\nthen **heaven and earth do not communicate** (天地不通),\n**all things do not generate** (万物不生),\n**Yin and Yang do not intermingle** (阴阳不交)—\nhow could **good and evil be distinguished** (岂能分别善恶)?\n\nOnce **heaven and earth intermingle** (天地既交),\n**Yin and Yang blend and ascend** (阴阳混蒸),\n**giving rise to all things** (生有万物),\n**balance lies between heaven and earth** (正在天地之间),\ncalled **harmonious qi** (冲和之气).\n**Harmonious** (冲和) means **equilibrium and moderation** (均平之义),\n**the will of the sage** (志公之心).\n\nThus, when **undertaking actions or triggering transformations** (举事发机),\nit is like **drawing a bow** (张弓):\n**the high is lowered** (高者抑之),\n**the low is raised** (下者举之).\nLike **striking a bell to find its center** (动铃取中),\nit is said to be **the will and qi** (志气).\n\n**Avoid the mud and dust of the mortal world** (厌寰海之泥尘).\n**Avoid** (厌) means **to reject** (弃).\n**The encircling seas** (寰海) are the **four seas connected and winding** (四海相通逆而绕).\n**Mud and dust** (泥尘) are the **earth within the encircling seas** (寰海之内地).\nThis earth, when **wet, becomes mud** (有水则泥),\nwhen **dry, becomes dust** (乾燥则尘).\n**Mud can soil** (泥能污物),\n**dust can obscure** (尘能蒙之).\nWhen **soiled to the point of corruption** (污已至于归),\nit is **worthy of rejection** (可厌弃).\n\nThen, **one seeks the methods of immortality** (寻不死之方).\n**Methods** (方) are **symbols** (象).\nThe **sages establish teachings through symbols** (圣人指象以立教),\nthus there are the **《Ancient Text of the Dragon and Tiger, Gold and Jade》** (《古文龙虎金碧上经》) in three volumes,\nthe **《Golden Jade Classic》 by Zǐyáng** (紫阳《金碧经》) in three chapters,\nthe **《Golden Jade Secret Transmission Classic》** (《金碧潜通诀》) in three volumes,\nthe **《Canon of the Three Realms and the Two Treasures》** (《周易参同契》) in three chapters,\nthe **《Great Ease Treatise》** (《太易志》) in twenty-four sections,\nand **countless sages and masters** (得道诸仙诸子)\nwho **expound and record** (演而着之) these teachings—\n**too many to enumerate** (莫可胜数).\nAll discuss the **gates of refining the Great Elixir** (修制大丹之门),\nsaying that **to ingest it is to attain immortality** (服之不死).\nHence, it is called **seeking** (寻).\n\n**To seek the elixir of longevity** (求延龄之诀),\nthe **sages do not fail to point and emphasize** (非不指之而丁宁),\nbut it is because **people seek externally without enlightenment** (自是求人而不悟).\n**Master Chōngxū** (冲虚子) said:\n*\"The path of the immortal is linked to the cloud-soaring crane,\nnot treading the **crooked beams** (偏梁) nor the **sword-like pass** (剑阁).\nThe world does not know the **immortal’s path** (仙路),\nwhich **differs entirely from the worldly path** (与世路都不同).\nThey only point to the **roots of the mountain passes** (关山根),\n**erring in confusion without number** (迷错自数言).\"*\nThis refers to **people not knowing the gate to seek the elixir** (不知求诀之门).\n\n*\"To seek the elixir’s key** (夫求诀者),\none must **first seek within oneself** (当自求).\nThe **bell** (铃) is **found in the study of the *Canon of the Three Realms and the Two Treasures*** (推考《参同》),\nthe **sword** (剑) is **found in the *Golden Jade Classic*** (骯《金碧》).\nTo **grasp the heavenly symbols externally** (外明天象)\nand **unite with the Dao’s mysteries internally** (内合玄庭),\nto **compress the subtle and wondrous within the heart** (撮微妙於心中),\nand **forge transformations within the spirit’s resonance** (机造化於神契).\nThus, **Master Chōngxū** (冲虚真人) said:\n*\"The immortals are not in other realms—\nthey are **found in the clarity of the heart and the spirit** (明公心与神).\"*\n\nAgain, the **《Treatise on the Immortals’ Teachings》** (《神仙可学论》) states:\n*\"Is the Dao far away?\n**Practice it, and you will reach it** (行斯至矣).\"*\n\n**The Dao’s ultimate void contains profound mystery** (至虚蕴妙),\n**awaiting stimulation to manifest** (待感而灵).\nLike **metal and stone holding resonance** (金石含响),\n**awaiting striking to chime** (待击而呜).\nThus, **open the mind’s chamber** (豁方寸) to **guide the void** (导虚).\nWhen **void is attained, stillness follows** (虚则静以感),\n**stillness brings clarity** (感则通),\n**clarity brings cosmic order** (通则宇宙大定),\nand **heavenly light shines forth** (天光发耀).\nThis is how one **recognizes the void and stillness** (可认虚静),\n**nurtures the profound and refined** (蕴妙精),\n**stimulates to achieve unity** (感而通)—\nthe **essence of the Great Elixir’s key** (大丹诀).\n\nAgain, **Master Yānluó** (烟萝子) said:\n*\"Those who pursue the True** (夫学真之士),\n**all must uphold an external perspective** (挺方外之见),\n**nurture the profound mysteries of the Dark** (蕴重玄之机),\n**communicate with the Dao’s essence** (与道通真),\n**discern the central rectitude within** (内明中正),\n**remain serene and tranquil in emptiness** (恬淡虚寂),\n**move in accordance with the profound depths** (动合渊微),\n**later viewing heaven and earth within the span of their hands** (后观天地於指掌中),\n**seeing the six directions within the tip of a hair** (视六合於毫芒之内).\n**The minute is not too small to enter** (细无不入),\n**the vast is not too great to encompass** (大无不包).\n**True and false, right and wrong—\nyou can distinguish them clearly** (真伪是非，子能分辫).\nOnly then can you **settle in the True Valley and preserve the spirit** (栖真谷神矣).\"*\n\nThese teachings—\n**how can one merely dwell in the body and await the elixir’s key** (岂可尸居而待诀)?",
      "overlap_context": "during legacy across ages** (历亿不绝).\n\nOne must **pair the female and male** (必雌雄而配偶).

      "translated_text": "Thus, the unenlightened and vulgar seek the heavens and earth,\npray to the gods and spirits,\npay homage to the sun and moon,\npursue the True Scriptures,\nstudy *yin-yang*,\nfathom the workings of creation,\nrecite and ponder without ceasing,\ndelve and research without rest,\nunraveling subtle words,\ndissecting hidden mysteries,\ntesting them in stillness,\nstriking them in emptiness—\nyet even after more than two *ji* (centuries),\nthey still have not glimpsed an encounter with the Dao,\nlet alone received even a hint of its essential teachings.\n\nYet the sages have already set their intent:\nto attain *sensing-through* (感通).\n\n**The essence of the Golden Elixir (金丹之奥旨):**\nThe Golden Elixir is made of gold, hence its name.\n*The Dragon-Tiger Mirror* (《龙虎镜》) states:\n*\"The celestial symbol shines brightly—none greater than the sun and moon.\nThe sun is the fiery essence of *Taiyang*—the vermilion mercury, the Dragon.\nThe moon is the aqueous essence of *Taiyin*—the lead and silver, the Tiger.\"*\n\nIt further says:\n*\"Vermilion cinnabar is the child of fire.\nMercury is the grandson of gold.\nGold is born from the sun,\nsilver nurtured by the moon.\nSun and moon interact,\nwater and fire unite,\nDragon and Tiger follow,\n*yin* and *yang* regulate—\nthus forming the Great Elixir.\nThese two treasures are the most refined of heaven and earth;\nwhen obtained and refined, they are called the Golden Elixir.\"*\n\nIts essential teachings are found in:\n*The Golden Purity Scripture* (《金碧经》),\n*The Grand Synchronization Contract and Great Ease Manifestation* (《参同契太易志》),\nand *The Sun-Moon Primordial Unity Scripture* (《日月混元经》).\nThese true texts all reveal the profound essence of the Golden Elixir,\npenetrating the subtle and reaching the marvelous—\nworthy of investigation and pursuit.\n\n**The profound sayings of the Cavernous Mysteries (洞玄妙之真说):**\n*Dong* (洞) is the unobstructed radiance of wisdom.\n*Xuan* (玄) is water and fire—\nwater’s blackness is *Xuanming* (玄冥),\nfire’s redness is *Danxuan* (丹玄).\nThe *Laozi Song* (老君歌) says:\n*\"Take the essence from black gold, the marrow from red—\nthe unparalleled elixir is refined.\nUse red in black to preserve longevity,\nuse black in red to become a celestial immortal.\nThe two inverted methods are both called *Xuan*;\nblack can transform red, red can grant immortality.\"*\n\n*Miao* (妙) refers to the marvel of the two *Xuan*s:\nwater’s essence is the moon,\nfire’s essence is the sun,\ncycling through the Cavernous Void,\ntransforming all things—\nits marvel is profound indeed.\nThe scripture further says:\n*\"Water can generate all things—\nonly the sage knows this.\"\nAnd again:\n\"Two without origin, one with substance—\nthe soul’s transformation is wondrous and hard to fathom.\nThus it is called *Miao* (marvelous).\"*\n\nThe True Scripture states:\n*\"Words are not carelessly forged,\ndiscourses are not baseless.\nUnless the elixir is perfected and the Dao attained,\none cannot record its essential teachings—\nthis is the sage’s warning.\nThus, *The Golden Purity*, *The Grand Synchronization*, and *The Great Ease*\nare the true essentials.\"*\n\nThus knowing the *yāoyāo míngmíng* (窈窈冥冥),\nwithin which lies the *jing* (精).\nKnowing this—\nthrough *The Golden Purity* and *The Grand Synchronization*,\nthe true sayings of the Golden Elixir’s profound marvels—\nonly then does one begin to grasp that in the *yāoyāo míngmíng* lies the *jing*.\n\nThe *Taishang* (太上) says:\n*\"Hū (惚) and huǎng (恍)—\nwithin them lies form.\nHuǎng (恍) and hū (惚)—\nwithin them lies substance.\nYāo (窈) and míng (冥)—\nwithin them lies the *jing*,\nits *jing* most true,\nwithin it lies authenticity.\nThis is so.\"*\n\nAgain, water is *Xuan* (玄),\nfire is *Dan* (丹).\n*Yāo* (窈) and *míng* (冥) mean deep.\nWater is externally dark and internally luminous—deep,\nfire is externally luminous and internally dark—obscure.\nThe *jing* (精) is the essence within water and fire.\n\n*The Sun-Moon Primordial Unity Scripture* says:\n*\"The cauldron is heaven and earth,\nthe elixir is sun and moon,\nwater and fire are *yin* and *yang*.\nMercury does not reveal its form,\ngold does not display its shape.\nMercury lies within cinnabar,\nlike the sun’s crow (乌).\nGold lies within black lead,\nlike the moon’s rabbit (兔).\nThe sun’s fullness in the heavens\ncan be seen in vermilion cinnabar and mercury.\nThe moon’s waxing and waning\ncan be seen in black lead and white gold.\n'Does not reveal its form' and 'does not display its shape'\nboth speak of concealment.\nSince the cauldron is heaven and earth,\nand the elixir is sun and moon,\nand the sun and moon are within the cauldron,\ntheir *qi* and *po* (精魄) reside within the sun and moon—\nhow could they be seen?\nThus, they do not reveal their form.\"*\n\n**Penetrating the elixir field with the One *Qi*:**\n*Guan* (贯) means to connect and pass through.\nThe scripture says:\n*\"Heaven has three *Xuan*s—sun, moon, and stars.\nMan has three *Zhen*s—three *dantian*s.\nThe three treasures are lead, mercury, and cinnabar.\nThe One *Qi* is the True Dao.\nTrue *qi* moves subtly—\nin heaven, it becomes the three luminaries;\nin man, the three *dantian*s;\non earth, the three treasures.\nThus, the elixir field is the One *Qi*.\"*\n\n**Examining the two names of water and fire:**\nThe Dao is formless and invisible—\nseen, it is not seen;\nheard, it has no sound.\nIt moves subtly, generating water and fire.\nThus, one examines:\nwater is one, fire is two—\ntheir numbers make three,\nand three generates all things.\nKnowing this, one regulates them accordingly.\n\n**Distributing the four symbols:**\n*Distributing* refers to the One *Qi* circulating—\nin the north as winter, the *Kan* (坎) symbol;\nin the east as spring, the *Zhen* (震) symbol;\nin the south as summer, the *Li* (离) symbol;\nin the west as autumn, the *Xia* (兑) symbol.\n\n**Refining the five phases:**\n*Refining* means smelting in the furnace,\nmelting and casting—\nall names for creation’s work.\nThe five phases are metal, wood, water, fire, and earth.\nAn ancient song says:\n*\"The five phases’ profound meanings are hard to fathom.\nAgain, it says:\n'Carefully observe the five phases—you yourself will see them.'\nAgain:\n'To complete the four symbols,\nto form the five spirits.'\nThe One *Qi* divides into *yin* and *yang*,\ncirculates as the four seasons,\nultimately forming the five phases.\nLike a person with four limbs,\nadding the head—\ncalled the five phases.\nThus, when refining fire,\nthe true *qi* in the cauldron divides into *yin* and *yang*,\n*yin* and *yang* generate the four symbols,\nthe four symbols complete and form the five phases.\nThus, *Lizhenren* (李真人) says:\n'Water one, metal four—\nthis becomes *wu* earth.\nFire two, wood three—\nthis becomes *ji* earth.'\nAll are achieved by refining fire,\nand by self-creation from metal—\nthus, it is called *modification* (修炼).\"*\n\n**Restraining the sun’s *hun* and calling forth the moon’s *po*:**\n*Restraining* means stillness.\n*The Long Life Chapter* (《长生篇》) says:\n*\"The sun’s *hun* and moon’s *po*—\nthe forms of *Qian* and *Kun* are complete.\nThe sun’s *hun* is the golden crow (*Jinwu*),\nthe moon’s *po* is the jade rabbit (*Yufu*).\"*",

Heaven and Earth.\nWithin Heaven’s Mysterious and Earth’s Yellow,\nall things are threaded.\nAll transformations arise within Heaven and Earth.\nNow, refining within the cauldron,\ntrue *qi* transforms—\nnever straying from the Mysterious Yellow.\n\n*Preserve the One while guarding the Three and Five.\nThe *Hun Yuan Jing* says:\n‘Three and Five with the One—\nHeaven and Earth’s utmost essence.\nYin and Yang interact, the Dao self-generates.’\nIt also says:\n‘Three and Five with the One—\ndiscerning sovereign and minister.\nDo not exceed the Five Phases,\nnor contravene the Heavenly Dao.’\nAgain it says:\n‘If you know not Three, Five, and One,\nwhere shall you seek the Land of the Immortals?’\nAnd again:\n‘The utmost essence does not exceed guarding the One,\nestablishing principle does not exceed the Three Powers,\nbreaking the theme does not exceed the Five Phases,\nconcealing treasures does not exceed Water and Fire.\nAll analogous methods converge upon this One.’\n\n*Now, in my humble words:\nThe One generates the Two,\nthe Two generates the Three,\nthe Three generates all things.\nEarth is the soil transformed by the Four Symbols.\nEarth is the Dao’s *qi*—\nall things arise from Earth.\nGold is the root of the True One,\nthe master of all transformations.\nThough Earth generates Gold,\nit does not overpower it.\n\n*One cold, one hot—\nKàn and Lǐ, Water and Fire—\nthus forming the Elixir.\nKàn’s Water is winter’s cold,\nLǐ’s Fire is summer’s heat.\nOne cold, one hot—\none Yin, one Yang—\none Gold, one Stone—\nthis is called the Elixir.\n\n*The Dragon and Tiger breathe in tandem.\nThe scripture says:\n‘The Dragon exhales to the Tiger,\nthe Tiger inhales the Dragon’s essence—\nmutually consuming, mutually honoring each other.’\nIt also says:\n‘The Dragon is emotion,\nthe Tiger is nature—\nemotion and nature interdependent,\nthe principle of return.’\n\n*This is called: transformations arise from the True,\nbeginning and end mutually dependent—\nthus the logic of breathing becomes clear.\n\n*The soul and spirit inhale and exhale.\nWhen the Dragon and Tiger breathe in tandem,\nthe Moon exhales the spirit,\nwhile the Sun swallows the soul.\nSouth and North copulate within Water and Fire,\nthe *Zǐ* and *Wǔ* revolve within *Mǎo* and *Yǒu*.\nWater is in the North—Kàn, the male, Yang.\nFire is in the South—Lǐ, the female, Yin.\nSouth and North copulate.\nThough *Mǎo* is in the East and *Yǒu* in the West,\nat the time of refinement,\nthey revolve within the cauldron—\nnever straying from *Zǐ* and *Wǔ*.\n\n*Summarizing the *Qián* and *Kūn* registers,\nthe master of leisurely transformations.\nSummarizing Heaven and Earth’s registers—\nthis is the *shù* (numerical principle).\nThe scripture says:\n‘The *Qián* register has two hundred sixteen,\nthe *Kūn* register one hundred forty-four.\nExtending and elaborating,\ncomparing and expanding—\ntotaling fifteen hundred twenty,\nexhausting all things’ numbers,\ncompleting the firm and yielding—\nthus it is called summarizing.’\n\n*The leisurely Dao of transformations—\nKàn and Lǐ.\nThe scripture says:\n‘Kàn and Lǐ vanish and reappear,\ntheir luminous essence descending to nourish all.’\nThis means the Kàn and Lǐ hexagrams\nare not counted among *Qián* and *Kūn*—\nthus ‘vanish and reappear.’\nLeisurely within the Six Void,\ndescending to nourish all things with luminous essence,\ntransforming all things.\n\n*Now, I illustrate with symbols.\nThis is the *Qián* hexagram.\n*Qián* inverted once becomes *Xùn*,\ntwice inverted is *Gèn*,\nthrice inverted is *Kūn*.\nAgain, *Kūn* inverted becomes *Zhèn*,\ntwice inverted is *Duì*,\nthrice inverted returns to *Qián*.\nThus, when *Qián* and *Kūn* are in effect,\nonly *Xùn*, *Gèn*, *Zhèn*, and *Duì* appear—\nKàn and Lǐ’s symbols are absent.\nHence, ‘vanish and reappear’—\nKàn and Lǐ are Sun and Moon,\ndescending their numbers to transform all things.\n\n*Mother and child encompassed within the square and circle,\nnurtured and dependent upon the cauldron’s gold.\nMother and child: true *qi* and mercury.\nEncompassed: blended together.\nSquare and circle: Kàn and Lǐ.\nThe *Zhuó Shēng Lùn* says:\n‘Kàn and Lǐ as square and circle,\nreturning to the axle’s center.’\nYin within Yang forms shape,\nYang within Yin forms image.\nCirculating the Four Symbols,\ninterweaving the Five Phases.\n\n*Nurturing, like a person using Yang warmth to feed,\nunceasingly nourishing at the proper time.\nDependent upon the cauldron and tripod—\nthe *Qián*-*Kūn*

Again, from the fifth to the tenth month, **yin qi** ascends while **yang qi** descends, and when **heaven** and **earth** invert, all things wither.\n\nThus, ascent and descent are both dependent upon the **Great Sun**.\n\nMoreover, the **Sun** is the **yang** of the day.\n\nWithin **heaven** and **earth**, among all phenomena, only **Earth** holds supreme authority, governing **yin** and **yang**, causing ascent and descent, generating all things, and reaching the marvels of **Divine Elixir**, attaining longevity and eternal life—all rely upon the **True God of the Wheel**, the **Supreme without Limit**, the result of **transformation**.\n\nThus, it is said that ascent and descent are dependent upon the **Great Sun**.\n\nWhy do the two luminaries radiate with five colors and emit fragrance?\n\nThe \"two luminaries\" refer to the **Sun** and **Moon**. It speaks of the **Sun** and **Moon** shining brightly, their light vast and luminous. **\"Radiate\"** means to suspend and emit light. It speaks of the **Sun** and **Moon** suspending and emitting great light, their five colors fragrant, transforming all things within **heaven** and **earth**.\n\nThe **Sun**, **Moon**, and Five Stars are not of constant hue; each responds to the **qi** of the four seasons, altering their colors. If in winter they display summer’s aspect, calamity will descend.\n\nThe *Sutra* says:\n*\"Since the opening of creation, the **Sun** and **Moon** have not waned, and the **golden** weight has not diminished. This is because **metal** and **wood** flourish within, while **water** and **fire** respond without. **Qian** remains vigorous and unceasing, thus its efficacy is achieved; the **Sun’s** hues do not flicker, thus it benefits **Zhen**.\"*\n\nOnly **heaven**, **earth**, the **Sun**, and **Moon** can endure and persist, aligning with the beginning and end of all things. The **Dragon** and **Tiger** unite, becoming the **Dao’s** supreme pivot, harmonizing with **heaven** and **earth**, conforming to the **numbers of yin and yang**, their **mysterious transformations** subtly responding—like connected pearls and matched jade—reaching the boundless.\n\nIn terms of refining the **Divine Elixir**, it encompasses **heaven** and **earth’s** **yin** and **yang**, the **Sun** and **Moon**, the **Dragon** and **Tiger**, the functions of the four seasons, the **qi** of the Five Phases, and the Five Stars in conjunction—**Sun** and **Moon** as matched jade—thus forming the **Great Elixir**.\n\nHence, it is said:\n*\"The two luminaries radiate, their five colors fragrant.\"*\n\nTheir **emotions** and **nature** unfold and depend upon each other, their **spirit** and **soul** alternate and conceal themselves.\n\nThis speaks of the **Divine Elixir** once formed, its **pottery** and **refinement** continuing unbroken. The **Dragon** represents **emotion**, the **Tiger** represents **nature**; the **Sun’s** **spirit**, the **Moon’s** **soul**. When the **Great Elixir** is complete, the **Dragon** and **Tiger** unfold and depend upon each other. A single grain of **Great Elixir** aligns with the **Sun**, aligns with the **Moon**, hence the alternation.\n\nThere exists a **Divine Chamber**, towering and majestic, where **mysterious** and **white** guard each other.\n\n**\"There\"** means **\"original.\"** The **Divine Chamber** refers to the **furnace**, **heaven** and **earth**, and the **human heart**.\n\nThe *Golden Splendor Sutra* says:\n*\"Refine within the **Divine Chamber** with **jing**—then the **Golden Elixir** will form. How could it not be firm?\"*\n\nThe **refining vessel** contains **qi** that gathers and condenses, opening and closing like empty doors—**Xi Yi’s** realm, the **造化**’s cavern, where **yang qi** stirs **Kun**.

Once external fire is applied, the **yin** and **yang** within the **furnace** steam like clouds and rain, water and fire both liquefying, **yin** and **yang** both moistening. When autumn’s chill and winter’s severity arrive, they naturally congeal—hence, **\"liquefy water and fire to congeal the Metal.\"** **\"Metal\"** refers to the **true Metal of Unity**.\n\n**\"Yao** and **ming**\" are the **furnace’s** **heaven** and **earth**; **heaven** and **earth** exist within **yao** and **ming**, and water and fire exist within **heaven** and **earth**—transformed by **true qi**.\n\nThus, it is said: **\"Liquefy water and fire to congeal the Metal.\"**\n\n**\"Facing yao and ming,\"** there is **being**.\n\n**\"Yao\"** is water, **\"ming\"** is fire, and there exists **true essence**—this is the **qi** of **empty mist**, forming **being**.\n\n**\"Radiant in crimson and purple,\"** it must be within **Qian** and **Kun**.\n\n**\"Radiant\"** refers to the **honored light** of crimson and purple—the **true color** of the **Great Elixir**.\n\n**Wei Jun** said:\n*\"The **Elixir** is when **cinnabar** transforms into **mercury**, **mercury** into **sand**, and **sand** into **Elixir**—hence, it is called **Returning Elixir**.\n*'Return'* means **reversion**. **Elixir** is the name for the **red** substance. **Mercury**’s original form is **Metal**; after becoming **sand**, it is called **Metal Sand**. When **purple-red** forms **Metal**, it returns to its original body—thus it is called **Great Returning Elixir**.\"*\n\nAn ancient song also says:\n*\"When the **Purple River’s chariot** arrives, **yellow gold** returns to my home.\"*\n\nIt also says:\n*\"Its color turns to purple—then it becomes **Elixir**.\"*\n\nWithin **heaven** and **earth** today, in the homes of emperors, they drag **Jú-lóu** in **crimson and purple** as symbols of honor—this is how the **Sage** modeled the **Dao** of the **Divine Elixir**.\n\n**\"Treading heaven and earth,\"** enduring forever.\n\n**\"Treading\"** means **wandering**. Wandering within **heaven** and **earth**, the four poles are not distant, the eight **huang**s are not vast—**body** aligns with **heaven** and **earth**, enduring forever; **Dao** aligns with the **Great Void**, without limit.\n\n**Wei Jun** said:\n*\"If there are those who transcend the **Void**, whose nature is harmonious, who see the world’s path as scalding water and abandon wife and child like discarding shoes, who perceive mortal life as fleeting and know the **Great Dao** endures—then this *Sutra* may be entrusted to them.

Without the **yang-essence qi** bestowed upon them, none would harbor a longing for the **Dao of Immortality**. Now, since one has devoted oneself entirely to loving the **Way** and seeking the **immortals**, there are none who do not possess the innate **immortal bone** within them.\n\nAgain, the *Treatise on the Learnability of Immortality* says: When one understands the origin of one’s **primordial life** and recognizes the dwelling of one’s **true qi**, one may cultivate the **Great Void** to purify and harmonize one’s nature, inhale and exhale, bend and stretch to regulate one’s body. By preserving the **high and subtle** and guarding one’s **fixed essence**, by using **elixirs** and **medicinal aids** to rectify and assist, one may achieve **complementary nourishment** of both **form** and **spirit**, transcending both—though not yet ascending to the heavens, I must still call them **immortals**.\n\nWhen one consumes the **elixir** and **bone** is transmuted into **gold**, **form** into **jade**, and **life** into **primordial life**, achieving **eternal longevity**—when one fasts and practices **virtue** to perfect **Dao and virtue**, the **Way** is employed through **emptiness and nothingness**, while **virtue** is named for **meritorious deeds**. The *Treatise on Nourishing Life* states: If one has **Dao** but lacks **virtue**, then **spirit** and **principle** will suffer ruin. If one has **virtue** but lacks **Dao**, then **nature** and **life** will perish early. None but those who **simultaneously cultivate Dao and virtue**, preserving **form** and **spirit**, blending the **Three Primordials**, and achieving **boundless longevity**—this is what is meant.\n\nSwiftly, one casts off the **worldly dust** like discarding a broken shoe, enduring as long as **heaven** and **earth**. Swiftly (*shūrán*) means **fleeting and sudden**; breaking a shoe (*zhǎn*) is to discard it. The **upper qi** of the **Great Elixir**—when a person consumes it, it surges upward like a bolt of lightning, casting aside the **worldly dust** as though discarding a broken shoe, and thus enduring as long as **heaven** and **earth**—this is the power of the **Great Elixir**.\n\nThe longevity of cranes and the years of tortoises may be likened to the swiftness of lightning and the whirl of wind; a mustard-seed city brushing against a stone may be likened to clouds dissolving and mists dispersing. **Master Tao of the Immortals** said: Though **heaven** and **earth** decay, I remain whole in **self**; though all phenomena perish, I preserve my **body**. These are metaphorical words to illustrate the **boundless** nature of the **Way**.\n\nThe **Most High** said: You may welcome it and not see its beginning, follow it and not see its end.
