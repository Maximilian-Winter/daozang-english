Those who wear and receive it must set up an image of the Northern Culmen Perfected, and prepare the proper offerings. Each year, on the third day of the dragon’s movement, the fifth day of the horse’s halt, the seventh day of the monkey’s abode, the ninth day of the dog’s establishment, and on *jiazi* and *gengshen* days, they shall make offerings. Each morning, with a pure heart, recite the divine incantations. Upon completing ten thousand recitations, success may be expected. Whatever is enacted shall respond immediately, provided one’s devotion is sincere. Recite softly, for loud voices may startle the gods and spirits. Avoid birth and death impurities; if defiled, perform purification rites. Disciples must revere this.\n\nThe Orthodox Unity Perfected Person states: In the world, faithful men and women who wear and receive the Northern Culmen wondrous register, practicing in accordance with its methods, can crush and extinguish demonic perversities and subdue malevolent spirits. Acting on heaven’s behalf to transform, aiding the state and succoring the people, when their merit is complete, they shall transcend the world and attain long life, their names inscribed in the registers of immortals. Their seven generations of ancestors shall ascend, and they shall attain the rank of heavenly beings. Those who treat these secret texts with disdain shall bring calamity upon their ancestors. Disciples of the true way must strive diligently.\n\nDisciple So-and-so, on this day, bearing the ritual offerings, respectfully approaches the gate of the Heavenly Master Perfected, to receive the register of the Supreme Northern Culmen’s Demon-Subduing Divine Incantations and Ghost-Slaying Register, first rank. After wearing and receiving it, I vow to abide by the precepts and covenants. Should I ever violate them, I willingly accept the jade statutes and dare not resent the Dao or blame my master.\n\nIn accordance with the mysterious statutes and divine decrees.\n\n**Supplication Ritual for the Register of the Supreme Northern Culmen’s Demon-Subduing Divine Incantations and Ghost-Slaying Register**\n\nSupplication text for the Register of the Supreme Northern Culmen’s Demon-Subduing Divine Incantations and Ghost-Slaying Register:\n\nOn this day of [year], [month], [day] in the [cyclical year], [disciple’s name], a devout believer of the Dao residing in [place of origin], declares: born on [year], [month], [day], [hour], my life is governed by the oversight of the [specific] Star Lord of the Northern Dipper.\n\nToday, bearing the ritual offerings, I humbly approach the gate of the Celestial Master of Dragon-Tiger Mountain, successor of the Han, to receive the first-rank Register of the Supreme Northern Culmen’s Demon-Subduing Divine Incantations and Ghost-Slaying Register, and vow to reverently cultivate its practice.\n\nThe Northern Culmen stands as the celestial symbol, governing the celestial administration within the Purple Tenuity. The Great Emperor resides at its center, radiating the vermilion scriptures upon the Jade Dipper. It annihilates demonic spirits and slays the lineages of evil. Commanding wind and thunder, it proclaims and executes its decrees. With each breath, it dispatches the Six Jia across the Six Heavens. Through incantations and gestures, it summons the ten thousand spirits within the ten thousand qi. Those who charge forth in battle number thirty-six generals. Those who escort and receive are a hundred billion, a thousandfold hosts. Its majesty and virtue defy description; its merits and achievements cannot be recounted. Should one violate its stern statutes, they willingly accept punishment from the netherworld. With steadfast resolve, I pledge to uphold and practice it, awaiting the master’s command.\n\nYet, I am unworthy—my earnest prayers know no bounds. Respectfully, I present this supplication at the gate of the Celestial Master.\n\nAccordingly, disciple [name], bearing the ritual pledge, approaches the Dao to declare and seek the first-rank Register of the Supreme Northern Emperor’s Demon-Subduing Divine Incantations and Ghost-Slaying Register. I further request the sacred names of the true masters, to be revered throughout my life.\n\nAs per the submitted supplication, on this day, I swear an oath before Heaven and Earth, pledge before the Three Officials, and break the tally to divide the ring. Following the statutes, the transmission is bestowed as follows:\n\n**Register, First Rank**\nThe Register of the Supreme Northern Emperor’s Demon-Subduing Divine Incantations and Ghost-Slaying Register.\n\n**Ritual Procedures**\n*Essential Guidelines for Cultivating the Orthodox Unity Tradition*\n\n**Sacred Names of the Three Ancestral and True Masters**\nAncestral Master: The Three Heavens’ Upholder of the Dao, Assistant of the Primordial, Great Dharma Master of Orthodox Unity, Divine and Mysterious Zhang, Perfected Lord of Transformative Stillness and Manifest Response, Zhang Daoling.\nTrue Master: Successor Master, Perfected Lord of the Wondrous Dao of the Great Clarity’s Propagated Teachings, Zhang Chong.\nLineage Master: Lineage Master, Perfected Lord of Illuminating Transformation and Vast Virtue of the Great Clarity, Zhang Lu.\n\n**Sacred Names of the Three Masters of Scriptures, Registers, and Transmission**\nScripture Master: Perfected Noble of the Southern Office, Minister of the Jade Treasury, Lord of All-Heaven Great Dharma, Successor of the Han, the Forty-Second Celestial Master, Zhang Zhengchang.\nRegister Master: True Lord of the Great Ultimate’s Enforcement of the Dao, Leader of the Numinous Treasure Teachings, Lord of All-Heaven Great Dharma, Successor of the Han, the Forty-Third Celestial Master, Zhang Yuchu.\nTransmission Master: Perfected Person of Mysterious Transformation, Leader of the Numinous Treasure Teachings, Enforcer of the Southern Office, Divine Lord of All-Heaven Great Dharma, Successor of the Teachings, the Forty-Fourth Celestial Master, Zhang Ningqing.\n\n**Officiating Masters**\nPresiding Dharma Master:\nWitnessing Master:\nSupervising Transmission Master:\n\n**Sponsoring Masters:**\n\nThe Orthodox Master of the Celestial Master declares: The azure firmament coalesces qi, the Purple Ultimate scatters its radiance. Inscribed are the canonical words of the Four Poles, subduing the mighty power of all demonic forces. Those who lightly divulge or neglect these teachings invite calamity; those who receive them with reverence and diligence are blessed with auspiciousness. Neither hidden nor manifest is this principle transgressed—both humans and spirits alike depend upon it. Thus did the Most High establish the teachings, transmitting them as a worldly tradition. Through the ages, Perfected Masters and Teachers have upheld and propagated these sacred instructions, guiding those of karmic affinity in an unbroken lineage.\n\nBy ancestral fortune, I have borne the grace of the state through generations. I have inherited the title of Orthodox Unity Master and revived the ancestral lineage of Mount Tianmu. As the transmission of registers and scriptures has endured through the ages, I have now selected skilled artisans to carve wood into books, ensuring their teachings endure.\n\nAs for the precepts to be upheld: compassion and mercy have been the way of perfected beings since antiquity. All who ascend the altar as faithful devotees must first purify themselves. Through profound contemplation and accumulated practice, may their merits grow sufficient. All aspirations shall be fulfilled, and from this, they shall transcend the mundane and enter the wondrous. Clearly recorded in the covenant—how could one not be vigilant?\n\nThe Celestial Master’s Disciple of Vast Subtlety declares: For over one thousand five hundred years, my family has employed the talismans and registers of the Most High to deliver beings across heaven and earth, safeguarding the nation’s destiny. The ancestral instructions are luminously clear—what need is there for superfluous praise?\n\nYet when our former Perfected Lord encountered the sagely dynasty, the realm was unified, and our teachings were first honored. From the common folk of Jiangnan to the humble-clad, all were placed under our guidance. Since I inherited the teachings, across three imperial courts, I have repeatedly received the grace of imperial favor. At the ascension of the dragon-throne, a resplendent title was bestowed: my reverence was likened to that of the Vacant Tranquility Master, my solemnity compared to the harmony of the Serene Void. Official ranks and precedents were drawn from the Tang, while lands and enfeoffments were granted as in the Liu state.\n\nIn performing good deeds and transmitting the Dharma registers, I strive to uphold the ancestral legacy. In praying for blessings and averting calamities for the people, I reverently follow the sagely instructions. In beseeching Heaven for eternal mandate, how dare I not be diligent? Through the transmission of registers and talismans, the flowering of civilization is further illuminated. Above, I respond to the emperor’s illustrious mandate; below, I bestow upon the common people the supreme blessings of the Imperial Ultimate. May my sincerity in this age bring forth abundant fortune.\n\nHere ends *The Register of the Northern Ultimate’s Subjugation of Demons, Divine Incantations, and Ghost-Slaying Talismans*.",

The Great Emperor resides at its center, radiating the vermilion scriptures upon the Jade Dipper. It annihilates demonic spirits and slays the lineages of evil. Commanding wind and thunder, it proclaims and executes its decrees. With each breath, it dispatches the Six Jia across the Six Heavens. Through incantations and gestures, it summons the ten thousand spirits within the ten thousand qi. Those who charge forth in battle number thirty-six generals. Those who escort and receive are a hundred billion, a thousandfold hosts. Its majesty and virtue defy description; its merits and achievements cannot be recounted. Should one violate its stern statutes, they willingly accept punishment from the netherworld. With steadfast resolve, I pledge to uphold and practice it, awaiting the master’s command.\n\nYet, I am unworthy—my earnest prayers know no bounds. Respectfully, I present this supplication at the gate of the Celestial Master.\n\nAccordingly, disciple [name], bearing the ritual pledge, approaches the Dao to declare and seek the first-rank Register of the Supreme Northern Emperor’s Demon-Subduing Divine Incantations and Ghost-Slaying Register.

      "translated_text": "**Sponsoring Masters:**\n\nThe Orthodox Master of the Celestial Master declares: The azure firmament coalesces qi, the Purple Ultimate scatters its radiance. Inscribed are the canonical words of the Four Poles, subduing the mighty power of all demonic forces. Those who lightly divulge or neglect these teachings invite calamity; those who receive them with reverence and diligence are blessed with auspiciousness. Neither hidden nor manifest is this principle transgressed—both humans and spirits alike depend upon it. Thus did the Most High establish the teachings, transmitting them as a worldly tradition. Through the ages, Perfected Masters and Teachers have upheld and propagated these sacred instructions, guiding those of karmic affinity in an unbroken lineage.\n\nBy ancestral fortune, I have borne the grace of the state through generations. I have inherited the title of Orthodox Unity Master and revived the ancestral lineage of Mount Tianmu. As the transmission of registers and scriptures has endured through the ages, I have now selected skilled artisans to carve wood into books, ensuring their teachings endure.\n\nAs for the precepts to be upheld: compassion and mercy have been the way of perfected beings since antiquity. All who ascend the altar as faithful devotees must first purify themselves. Through profound contemplation and accumulated practice, may their merits grow sufficient. All aspirations shall be fulfilled, and from this, they shall transcend the mundane and enter the wondrous. Clearly recorded in the covenant—how could one not be vigilant?\n\nThe Celestial Master’s Disciple of Vast Subtlety declares: For over one thousand five hundred years, my family has employed the talismans and registers of the Most High to deliver beings across heaven and earth, safeguarding the nation’s destiny. The ancestral instructions are luminously clear—what need is there for superfluous praise?\n\nYet when our former Perfected Lord encountered the sagely dynasty, the realm was unified, and our teachings were first honored. From the common folk of Jiangnan to the humble-clad, all were placed under our guidance. Since I inherited the teachings, across three imperial courts, I have repeatedly received the grace of imperial favor. At the ascension of the dragon-throne, a resplendent title was bestowed: my reverence was likened to that of the Vacant Tranquility Master, my solemnity compared to the harmony of the Serene Void. Official ranks and precedents were drawn from the Tang, while lands and enfeoffments were granted as in the Liu state.\n\nIn performing good deeds and transmitting the Dharma registers, I strive to uphold the ancestral legacy. In praying for blessings and averting calamities for the people, I reverently follow the sagely instructions. In beseeching Heaven for eternal mandate, how dare I not be diligent? Through the transmission of registers and talismans, the flowering of civilization is further illuminated. Above, I respond to the emperor’s illustrious mandate; below, I bestow upon the common people the supreme blessings of the Imperial Ultimate. May my sincerity in this age bring forth abundant fortune.\n\nHere ends *The Register of the Northern Ultimate’s Subjugation of Demons, Divine Incantations, and Ghost-Slaying Talismans*.",
