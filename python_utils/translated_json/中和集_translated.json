  "full_translation": "*The Zhonghe Collection*\n\n**Title:** *Zhonghe Collection*. Composed by Li Daochun of the Yuan dynasty. Six juan. Based on the edition from the *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, *Dongzhen* section, Methods category.\n\n**Preface to the *Zhonghe Collection***\n\nCai Zhiyi of Sun’an in Weiyang was a disciple of Master Yingchan, Li Qing’an. Having seen through the illusions of the mundane world, he devoted himself to cultivating the immortal Dao. Gathering the remnants of his master’s teachings—scattered fragrance and lingering essence—he compiled them into this work, titling it the *Zhonghe Collection*, after his master’s chamber of stillness.\n\nIn the autumn of the *bingwu* year of the *Dade* era, he sought my approval, wishing to commit it to print and awaken later generations. Before I had even opened the scroll, I already knew that all delusions would be swept away and the One True [Reality] would stand revealed.\n\nIt speaks of the Mandate bestowed by Heaven as life, received by humans as nature; of the Primordial Supreme Polarity, the spontaneous Golden Elixir, its radiance illuminating the Great Void—requiring no artificial refinement—all secrets laid bare without omission. Through this, one may fathom the numinous and comprehend transformation, deepening the root and stabilizing the ultimate; one may shed the mortal coil and attain spiritual transfiguration, returning to the Non-Ultimate.\n\nMoreover, it reveals that the Dao is a thing of undifferentiated wholeness; that the Confucians’ “central harmony nurtures all things,” and the Buddhists’ “pointing to the mind to see nature,” though differing in method, all arise from the same Supreme Polarity. Thus, the ancient sages of Daoism were ever diligent in saving others; the Buddha did not slight even you; how could the Duke of Zhou deceive us?\n\nLet those who read this collection guard against doubt.\n\nWritten by Du Daojian of Nangu on the *Dangtu* road at the *Xianyuan Zhen* Hall in Qiantang.\n\n---\n\n**Zhonghe Collection, Juan One**\n\nComposed by Li Daochun, Yuan Su, the Pure Toad Master of Yingchan of Duliang.\nCompiled by his disciple, Cai Zhiyi, the Precious Toad Master of Sun’an.\n\n*The Mysterious Gate holds no fixed doctrine—*\n*Movement and stillness arise without origin.*\n\nThe *Taiji* Diagram—Yin and Yang without Beginning\n\nThe Buddhists call it *Perfect Enlightenment*; the Daoists, the *Golden Elixir*; the Confucians, the *Supreme Polarity*. That which is called \"the Ultimateless and yet the Supreme Polarity\" means the ungraspable that is yet grasped.\n\nThe Buddhists say: *\"Thusness unmoving, luminously ever-aware.\"*\nThe *Book of Changes* states: *\"Still and unmoving, yet responsive and penetrating.\"*\nThe *Elixir Scriptures* declare: *\"When body and mind are unmoving, the true mechanism of the Ultimateless arises\"*—this speaks of the wondrous essence of the Supreme Polarity.\n\nThus, the three teachings all esteem stillness and concentration. As Master Zhou said: *\"Abide in stillness.\"* For when the human mind is still and undisturbed by external things, it is serene with Heavenly Principle—this is the wondrousness of the Supreme Polarity. Once stirred by external things, partiality and bias arise—this is the transformation of the Supreme Polarity. If, in moments of stillness and concentration, one guards what is preserved within, then Heavenly Principle remains ever luminous, the empty and numinous never obscured. When movement comes, there is naturally a master within, and all things that arise can be met with response.\n\nWhen the work of stillness and concentration is fully refined, one arrives at this state not by striving but spontaneously. The true Ultimateless is restored, the wondrous responsiveness of the Supreme Polarity is illuminated, and the principles of Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things are all complete within oneself.\n\n*The Diagram of Central Harmony and Uprightness*\n\nThe Unerring Manifestation\n*The Record of Rites* states: \"Joy, anger, sorrow, and delight—before they are aroused is called *zhong* (the Mean); when aroused and all in due measure is called *he* (harmony).\" Before arousal, in the stillness of concentration, one guards what is preserved within—hence it is called *zhong*. Preserved yet without form, it is thus called the great root of all under Heaven. When aroused and in due measure, in movement one guards what is expressed—hence it is called *he*. With every manifestation unerring, it is thus called the universal Dao of all under Heaven. If one can attain *zhong* and *he* within the body, then the original substance is empty yet numinous, still yet aware, and in motion upright. Thus one can respond to the endless transformations of all under Heaven.\n\n*Laozi* said: \"If one can constantly abide in clarity and stillness, Heaven and Earth all return.\" This is the same meaning as Zisi’s \"attaining *zhong* and *he*, whereby Heaven and Earth take their proper places and the myriad things are nurtured.\" *Zhong* and *he*—these are the wondrous functions of resonance and response, the pivot of adaptation to change. *The Book of Changes* embodies the ceaseless flow of generation and nurturance, the totality of every movement and stillness.\n\nIs it not fitting that I name my dwelling with the plaque \"Central Harmony\"?\n\n*Yielding and Accord*\nBody, mind, worldly affairs—these are the four conditions. All people in the world are entangled by them, yet only those who yield can respond. Constantly responding, constantly still—what entanglement remains?\n\nWhat is yielding?\nThe body yields in tranquil stillness, the mind yields in luminous clarity, the world yields in harmonious unity, affairs yield in natural spontaneity.\n\nWhat is accord?\nAccord with Heaven’s mandate, accord with Heaven’s Dao, accord with Heaven’s seasons, accord with Heavenly Principle.\n\nThe body in accord with Heaven’s mandate can thus respond to others;\nThe mind in accord with Heaven’s Dao can thus respond to things;\nThe world in accord with Heaven’s seasons can thus respond to change;\nAffairs in accord with Heavenly Principle can thus respond to opportunity.\n\nHaving mastered yielding and accord, and further mastered response, one is freed from the four conditions. Those who attain this insight abide in constant response and constant stillness, constant clarity and stillness.\n\n*The Diagram of Illuminating Delusion*\nAn ancient saying goes: \"Constantly extinguish the moving mind, not the illuminating mind.\" Every unmoving mind is the illuminating mind; every restless mind is the deluded mind. The illuminating mind is the mind of Dao; the deluded mind is the human mind. The mind of Dao is subtle, meaning it is profound and difficult to perceive. The human mind is perilous, meaning it is precarious and unstable. Though the human mind also contains the mind of Dao, and the mind of Dao also contains the human mind, this depends on the interplay of movement and stillness. Only those who sincerely hold fast to the Mean preserve the illuminating mind constantly, keep the deluded mind unmoving, transform peril into peace, and reveal the subtle in clarity. At this stage, the mind of delusion is restored, and the Dao of non-delusion is accomplished.\n\n*The Book of Changes* says: \"Return—is this not the manifestation of Heaven and Earth’s mind?\"\n\n*Eulogy on the Diagram of the Supreme Polarity*\nThe central circle ○ represents the Ultimateless that is the Supreme Polarity. The Supreme Polarity moves and generates yang; when movement reaches its limit, it becomes still, and stillness generates yin. With the interplay of yin and yang, the Two Modes are established. ○ represents the Two Modes. ○ represents yang in motion. ○ represents yin in stillness. Yin and yang intermingle, generating the Four Images. ○: when the Four Images move and move again, it is called *old yang*; when movement reaches its limit and becomes still, it is called *young yin*; when stillness reaches its limit and moves again, it is called *young yang*; when stillness persists in stillness, it is called *old yin*. The Four Images in their movement and stillness generate the Eight Trigrams: *Qian* (☰) as one and *Dui* (☱) as two represent the movement and stillness of *old yang*; *Li* (☲) as three and *Zhen* (☳) as four represent the movement and stillness of *young yin*; *Gen* (☶) as five and *Kan* (☵) as six represent the movement and stillness of *young yang*; *Xun* (☴) as seven and *Kun* (☷) as eight represent the movement and stillness of *old yin*. Yin in reverse, yang in sequence, ascending and descending without cease, the mechanism unfolds to generate the sixty-four hexagrams—here the Dao of the myriad things is complete.\n\nThe upper circle ○ is the beginning of qi transformation. The lower circle ○ is the mother of form transformation. To know qi transformation but not form transformation is to fail in attaining vastness. To know form transformation but not qi transformation is to fail in attaining subtlety. Thus a eulogy is composed to verify this.\n\n*Eulogy in Twenty-Five Stanzas*\nThe Dao is originally supremely empty, the supremely empty without form.\nExhausting the inexhaustible, beginning from the unbeginning.\nThe empty to its limit transforms into spirit, spirit’s changes generate qi.\nQi gathers to form shape, one divides into two.\nTwo then interact, interaction then brings pairing.\nYin and yang intermingle, *Qian* and *Kun* take their places.\nMovement and stillness unceasing, the Four Images interconnect.\nVigorous and yielding propel each other, the Eight Trigrams are thus linked.\nRevolving the Five Phases in constancy, establishing the four seasons to complete the year.\nPure harmony transforms into purity, providing origin and nurturance.\nIn Heaven it revolves the myriad images, on Earth it fosters the multitudes of beings.\nForms bequeath to forms, things conceive within things.\nTransformation upon transformation, generation upon generation—how could there be an end?\nAll things under Heaven are born from being, being is born from non-being.\nBeing and non-being interweave, the hidden and manifest support each other.\nTracing to their origin, all the myriad existents are fundamentally rooted in qi.\nTracing to their end, all the myriad things ultimately transform in form.\nThus we know that the myriad things are fundamentally one in form and qi,\nForm and qi are fundamentally one in spirit.\nSpirit is fundamentally supremely empty, the Dao is fundamentally supremely non-being—*The Book of Changes* is within them.\nHeaven takes its place above, Earth takes its place below.\nHumans and things dwell in the center, naturally blending and transforming—qi is within them.\nHeaven and Earth are the greatest of things, humans are the most numinous among things—Heaven and humans are one.\nThe cosmos is in one’s hands, the myriad transformations arise from one’s body—change is within them.\nThe ultimate of humans is to stand between Heaven and Earth and establish destiny,\nTo receive the empty and numinous and complete nature.\nEstablishing nature and establishing destiny—spirit is within them.\nDestiny is tied to qi, nature is tied to spirit.\nConcealing spirit in the mind, gathering qi in the body—the Dao is within them.\nForm transforms and there is life, with life there is death.\nEmerging from life and entering death—this is the constant of things.\nQi transforms and there is no life, with no life there is no death.\nNon-life and non-death—this is the constant of spirit.\nForm transformation embodies Earth, qi transformation images Heaven.\n\nForm transformation arises from resonance, qi transformation is natural.\nThe enlightened and lofty scholar preserves both qi and spirit.\nA thousand harmonies, ten thousand unions—naturally they attain the real.\nThe real within the real—profound and ever more profound.\nFrom the formless arises form—this is called the Embryonic Immortal.\nTo cultivate this Dao, where does one begin?\nOnly in stillness, only in emptiness may the Embryonic Immortal be hoped for.\nEmptiness means no obstruction, stillness means no desire.\nWhen emptiness reaches its extreme and stillness is profound, one observes transformation and knows return.\nIn movement, abide by stillness; in reality, embrace emptiness.\nThese two principles require each other—spirit and Dao are together.\nDao is the master of spirit, spirit is the master of qi, qi is the master of form, form is the master of life.\nWithout life, form abides; form abiding, qi abides; qi abiding, then spirit abides; spirit abiding, there is no abiding—this is called the Abiding of No-Abidance.\nRefining form with golden liquid, preserving spirit with jade talisman.\nForm and spirit both wondrous, they unite with Dao in truth.\nThe treasure of destiny is congealed, the pearl of nature is luminous,\nThe primordial spirit is numinous, the Embryonic Immortal is achieved,\nThe Dao of emptiness and naturalness is complete.\nGreat indeed is spirit—is it not the root of all transformations?\n\n**Hidden Meaning Before the Hexagrams – First on the Images**\nThe *Yi* can be changed, yet is not the constant *Yi*.\nThe image can be imaged, yet is not the Great Image.\nThe constant *Yi* is unchanging, the Great Image is imageless.\nThe constant *Yi* is the *Yi* before the hexagrams were drawn.\nThe changing *Yi* is the *Yi* after the hexagrams were drawn.\nThe constant *Yi* unchanging is the body of the Supreme Ultimate.\nThe *Yi* that can be changed is the origin of creation.\nThe Great Image is the beginning of movement and stillness.\nThe image that can be imaged is the mother of forms and names.\nAbiding in quiescence through kalpas—this is the constant *Yi*.\nPervading antiquity without cease—this is the changing *Yi*.\nUtterly empty and without form—this is the Great Image.\nManifesting according to circumstances—this is the image that can be imaged.\nThe so-called constant is that whose beginning cannot be fathomed, whose end cannot be measured,\nThat which endures through a thousand myriad ages, vast and solitary in its existence.\nThe so-called great is that which externally envelops Heaven and Earth, internally fills the cosmos,\nPervades the worlds as numerous as the grains of the Ganges, serene and perfectly complete.\nThe constant *Yi* unchanging can thus govern the endless changes under Heaven.\nThe Great Image imageless can thus give form to the endless affairs under Heaven.\nThe *Yi* and the images—are they not the origin of the Dao?\n\n**Second on Constancy and Change**\nThe constant *Yi* does not change, the changing *Yi* is not constant.\nIts constancy does not change, thus it can respond to change.\nIts change is not constant, thus it can embody constancy.\nBeginning and end unchanging—this is the constancy of the *Yi*.\nMovement and stillness inconstant—this is the change of the *Yi*.\nStanding alone without alteration—this is attaining constancy.\nCircling without cease—this is penetrating change.\nWithout knowing constancy, one cannot penetrate change;\nWithout penetrating change, one cannot know constancy.\nConstancy and change—are they not the origin of the *Yi*?\n\n**Third on Substance and Function**\nConstancy is the substance of the *Yi*.\nChange is the function of the *Yi*.\nUnchanging through past and present—this is the substance of the *Yi*.\nChanging with the times—this is the function of the *Yi*.\nWithout thought, without action—this is the substance of the *Yi*.\nWith resonance, with response—this is the function of the *Yi*.\nKnowing its function, one can fully realize its substance.\nPreserving its substance, one can effectively employ its function.\nThe sage observes far and near, seeks distantly and proximately—thus attaining its substance.\nThe noble person advances virtue and cultivates work, acts and creates tools—thus following its function.\nAs for exhausting principle and fulfilling nature, delighting in Heaven and knowing destiny,\nCultivating the self and ordering the state, establishing laws and regulations—\nThere is nothing outside the *Yi*.\nFully realizing the substance of the *Yi* suffices to know constancy;\nEffectively employing the function of the *Yi* suffices to penetrate change.\n\n**Fourth on Movement and Stillness**\nHard and soft push and surge—this is the movement and stillness of the *Yi*.\nYin and yang ascend and descend—this is the movement and stillness of qi.\nOdd and even intermingle and accumulate—this is the movement and stillness of the hexagrams.\nQi and form wax and wane—this is the movement and stillness of things.\nDay and night, waking and sleeping—this is the movement and stillness of the body.\nAs for the body’s advance and retreat, the mind’s arising and ceasing,\nThe world’s opening and obstruction, affairs’ success and failure—\nAll are one movement and one stillness, mutually dependent and concealed.\nObserving their movement and stillness, the changes of all affairs and the conditions of all things can be seen.\nIn stillness, there is preservation; in movement, there is discernment.\nIn stillness, there is a master; in movement, decisions can be made.\nIn stillness, there is stability; in movement, there is no misfortune.\nStillness is the foundation of movement, movement is the mechanism of stillness.\nWhen movement and stillness do not lose their constancy, the Dao is luminous.\n\n**Fifth on Flexion and Extension**\nHeat departs, cold arrives—this is the flexion and extension of the year.\nSun departs, moon arrives—this is the flexion and extension of qi.\nPast departs, present arrives—this is the flexion and extension of the world.\nAs for being and non-being mutually arising, difficulty and ease mutually completing,\nLong and short mutually shaping, high and low mutually inclining—\nAll are the principle of flexion and extension.\nKnowing the Dao of mutual resonance in flexion and extension,\nOne can exhaust the endless benefits under Heaven.\n\n**Sixth on Waning and Waxing**\nWaxing is the beginning of waning.\nWaning is the end of waxing.\nWaxing is the gathering of qi.\nWaning is the dispersal of form.\nGrowing, nurturing, and maturing—this is called waxing.\nReturning to the root and restoring destiny—this is called waning.\nOriginating and penetrating—this is the waxing of the *Yi*.\nBeneficial and upright—this is the waning of the *Yi*.\nSpring and summer—this is the waxing of the year.\nAutumn and winter—this is the waning of the year.\nInfancy and maturity—this is the waxing of the body.\nOld age and death—this is the waning of the body.\nNon-being and being—this is the waxing of things.\nBeing and non-being—this is the waning of things.\nWaxing is the companion of life.\nWaning is the companion of death.\nSince the two qi first divided,\nThere has never been a principle of waning without waxing,\nNor has there been a thing that waxes without waning.\nThose who penetrate and understand this illuminate principle to its utmost clarity.\n\n**Seventh on Spirit and Mechanism**\nThat which abides within—this is spirit.\nThat which issues forth and hits the mark—this is mechanism.\nQuiescent and unmoving—this is spirit.\nResonating and penetrating—this is mechanism.\nHidden and unfathomable—this is spirit.\nResponsive and without fixed direction—this is mechanism.\nEncompassed within the body—this is spirit.\n\n**Expanding to the Myriad Things—this is mechanism.**\n**Fortunes and misfortunes foretold—this is spirit.**\n**Shifting and never abiding—this is mechanism.**\n**Cultivating the four virtues and ceaselessly strengthening oneself—this resides in spirit.**\n**Permeating the Three Powers and responding endlessly—this is the operation of mechanism.**\n\n**Eighth on Wisdom and Action**\n**Wisdom** is profound understanding of principle.\n**Action** is vigorous practice of the Dao.\nProfound understanding of principle is knowing without seeing.\nVigorous practice of the Dao is accomplishing without striving.\nNot stepping beyond the door yet knowing all under heaven,\nNot peering through the window yet perceiving the Way of heaven—\nThis is profound understanding.\nCeaselessly strengthening oneself, adapting to all circumstances—\nThis is vigorous action.\nKnowing disorder before it arises,\nKnowing danger before it emerges,\nKnowing ruin before it befalls,\nKnowing misfortune before it strikes—\nThis is profound understanding.\nAbiding in the body yet not burdened by it,\nMoving in the heart yet not enslaved by it,\nActing in the world yet not swayed by it,\nEngaging in affairs yet not hindered by them—\nThis is vigorous action.\nThose who profoundly understand principle can transform disorder into order,\nDanger into safety,\nRuin into preservation,\nMisfortune into fortune.\nThose who vigorously practice the Dao can attain longevity for the body,\nProfound tranquility for the heart,\nGreat peace for the world,\nAnd grand accomplishment in affairs.\nNone but those of great wisdom and great action can reach this.\n\n**Ninth on Discerning the Times**\nNothing surpasses recognizing the times for mastering change,\nNothing surpasses comprehending principle for recognizing the times,\nNothing surpasses emptiness and quiescence for illuminating principle.\nEmptiness brings clarity,\nQuiescence brings purity.\nWhen purity and clarity reside in the person,\nThe heavenly principle shines forth.\nThe transformations of heaven can be seen in the *Yi*.\nThe trends of the world can be verified in its images.\nThe truth or falsity of things can be discerned in their forms.\nThat which clings to form cannot be without its counterpart.\nThat which manifests in color cannot be without distinction.\nWhen heaven is about to bring rain, the *qi* must first steam.\nWhen a mountain is about to collapse, its base must first crumble.\nWhen a person is about to encounter profit or harm, their countenance must first change.\nIt is like the nest knowing the wind,\nThe burrow knowing the rain,\nHibernating creatures responding to the seasons,\nFalling leaves heralding autumn.\nOr like merchants placing pheasant tails on their boats and carriages\nTo forecast clear or rainy weather—\nWhen the sky is usually clear, the tail stands upright;\nWhen rain is coming, the tail droops.\nEven insentient things behave thus,\nHow much more so for humans?\nThose who fail to recognize the changes of the times\nHave not yet illuminated principle.\n\n**Tenth on Rectifying the Self**\nFor advancing virtue and cultivating endeavors,\nNothing surpasses rectifying the self.\nOnce the self is rectified, nothing remains unrectified.\nAll forms and names are not established without rectitude.\nAll affairs and events are not accomplished without rectitude.\nIn daily life, in planning and responding to others,\nNothing does not begin with the self.\nAll matters, principles, heads, and things\nAlso do not originate from anything other than the self.\nThus, the essentials of self-cultivation\nMust take rectifying the self as their foundation.\nRectifying the self in dealing with others—others will also return to rectitude.\nRectifying the self in handling affairs—affairs will also return to rectitude.\nRectifying the self in responding to things—things will also return to rectitude.\nOnly the single rectification of all under heaven\nCan penetrate the myriad changes of all under heaven.\nThus, rectifying the self is the great function of self-cultivation,\nThe ladder to sagehood.\n\n**Eleventh on Practice**\nClearing the heart and releasing burdens,\nCutting off thoughts and forgetting emotions,\nReducing selfishness and restraining desires,\nPreserving simplicity and embracing the uncarved—\nThis is the practice of the Dao of the *Yi*.\nWhen the heart is clear and burdens are released,\nOne can fully comprehend principle.\nWhen thoughts are cut off and emotions forgotten,\nOne can fully realize one’s nature.\nWhen selfish desires are entirely extinguished,\nOne can attain the Dao.\nWhen simplicity and purity are preserved,\nOne can know heaven.\n\n**Twelfth on Stimulus and Response**\nQuiescent yet penetrating,\nNon-doing yet accomplishing,\nNot seeing yet knowing—\nThis is the stimulus and response of the Dao of the *Yi*.\nQuiescent yet penetrating—nothing is not penetrated.\nNon-doing yet accomplishing—nothing is not accomplished.\nNot seeing yet knowing—nothing is not known.\nMoving and then penetrating is not true penetration.\nActing and then accomplishing is not true accomplishment.\nSeeing and then knowing is not true knowledge.\nThese three fall far short of the Dao of stimulus and response.\nOnly by acting before things arise,\nResponding before movement begins,\nPerceiving before sprouts appear—\nThese three advancing together—\nCan there be nothing that is not penetrated,\nNo affair that is not responded to,\nNo abiding that is not beneficial.\nThose who fully realize this Dao—\nIs it not Yanzi alone?\n\n**Thirteenth on the Three Eases**\nThe Three Eases are:\nFirst, the Ease of Heaven;\nSecond, the Ease of the Sage;\nThird, the Ease of the Heart.\nThe Ease of Heaven is the principle of the *Yi*.\nThe Ease of the Sage is the images of the *Yi*.\nThe Ease of the Heart is the Dao of the *Yi*.\nIn observing the Ease of the Sage, the value lies in illuminating the images—\nWhen images are illuminated, one enters sagehood.\nIn observing the Ease of Heaven, the value lies in exhaustively investigating principle—\nWhen principle is exhausted, one knows heaven.\nIn observing the Ease of the Heart, the value lies in practicing the Dao—\nWhen the Dao is practiced, one fully realizes the heart.\nWithout studying the Sage’s *Yi*, one cannot understand the Ease of Heaven;\nWithout understanding the Ease of Heaven, one cannot know the Ease of the Heart;\nWithout knowing the Ease of the Heart, one cannot master change.\nThus, the *Yi* is the book of mastering change.\n\n**Fourteenth on Resolving Confusion**\nThe waxing and waning of *qi*,\nThe rising and falling of times,\nThe prosperity and adversity of cycles,\nThe openness and blockage of the world—\nThis is the Ease of Heaven.\nThe auspiciousness and inauspiciousness of hexagrams,\nThe gains and losses of lines,\nThe perilousness and easiness of judgments,\nThe correctness and obscurity of images—\nThis is the Ease of the Sage.\nThe success or failure of fate,\nThe advancement or retreat of the self,\nThe success or failure of the world,\nThe safety or peril of position—\nThis is the Ease of the Heart.\nDeeply mastering the Ease of Heaven, one knows the trends of the times.\nDeeply mastering the Ease of the Sage, one knows transformations.\nDeeply mastering the Ease of the Heart, one knows nature and destiny.\nUniting the Ease of the Heart with the Ease of the Sage,\nMatching the Ease of the Sage with the Ease of Heaven,\nComparing the Ease of Heaven with the Ease of the Heart,\nAnd penetrating them as one—\nThis is called the consummate scholar.\n\n**Fifteenth on Dispelling Doubts**\nChange and movement have their times,\nSafety and peril lie within oneself.\nFortune and misfortune, gain and loss—\nAll begin with the self.\nThus, those who master change are those who follow the times.\nThose who follow the times—\nEven in peril, they find safety.\n\nThose who master change—\nEven in chaos, they bring order.\nThose who do not lose their grasp—\nEven in adversity, they find prosperity.\nThose who do not attend to their conduct—\nEven in abundance, they remain benighted.\nThose who dim their brilliance—\nDwell in *Ming Yi* yet suffer no harm.\nThose who rely on their possessions—\nDwell in *Da You* yet surely meet with harm.\nThose who can respond from afar—\nTheir scholars are discerning.\nThose who are close yet uninvolved—\nTheir intent is perverse.\nThose who are weakest yet prevail—\nThey have found their support.\nThose who are firmest yet never err—\nThey possess the Dao/Way.\nThe use of *Yi*—\nIt aids in overcoming misfortune and resolving crises.\nThe vision of *Kui*—\nIt spares the wicked from resentment.\nThose who do not value their virtue—\nNowhere can they find refuge.\nThose who do not possess themselves—\nNowhere can they find profit.\nThose who stand alone and rely on themselves—\nAchieve no merit.\nThose who fear and reflect—\nAttain good fortune.\nThose who benefit others—\nOthers benefit them.\nThose who profit others—\nOthers profit them.\nThose who are trustworthy to others—\nOthers trust them.\nThose who show kindness to others—\nOthers show kindness to them.\nThose who fear misfortune—\nMeet no misfortune.\nThose who fear calamity—\nMeet no calamity.\nThose who fear disaster—\nFortune surely arrives.\nThose who disregard fortune—\nDisaster surely arrives.\nWhat I call \"safety and peril lie within oneself\"—\nWhat further doubt remains?\n\n**Sixteenth on Sagely Achievement**\nWhat makes the sage a sage—\nIs the use of *Yi* alone.\nThe use of *Yi* in achieving success—\nIs emptiness and stillness alone.\nEmpty, then nothing is not contained.\nStill, then nothing escapes notice.\nEmpty, then one can receive all things.\nStill, then one can respond to all affairs.\nEmptiness and stillness sustained—\nThen numinous clarity arises.\nEmptiness—\nIs the image of Heaven.\nStillness—\nIs the image of Earth.\n\"Ceaselessly striving to strengthen oneself\"—\nIs Heaven’s emptiness.\n\"Virtue thick, it bears all things\"—\nIs Earth’s stillness.\nBoundless and vast—\nIs Heaven’s emptiness.\nSquare and broad without limit—\nIs Earth’s stillness.\nThe Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth—\nIs only emptiness, only stillness.\nEmptiness and stillness within oneself—\nThen Heaven and Earth are within oneself.\nThe *Daoist Canon* says: \"If one can constantly remain pure and still, Heaven and Earth all return to them.\"\nIs this not what it means?\nPurity is emptiness.\nEmptiness and stillness—\nAre they not the numinous power and sagely achievement?\n\n*End of the First Scroll of the Zhonghe Collection*\n*(The base text reads \"王\" [wang], but this is likely an error for \"工\" [gong], and should be amended.)*\n\n*The Second Scroll of the Zhonghe Collection*\n*Composed by Li Daochun Yuan Su of the Pure Toad Studio in Du

reveal the profound and mysterious principles of the Supreme Dao/Way.\n\n**Setting the Crucible**\nA pillar propping heaven, supporting earth—so vast and dim,\nWho names it the Jade Crucible?\nOnce refined within this vessel,\nEmergence and return are all its domain.\n\n**Erecting the Cauldron**\nNeither existent nor non-existent, not centered between,\nExternally void, internally hollow.\nA resolute man overturns it to see—\nThere, that which was always crimson from the beginning.\n\n**Returning the Elixir**\nBeyond the roar of thunder, originally luminous,\nObscured only by clinging to illusory form.\nIf drawn forth from within the elixir,\nPerfectly round, utterly void, numinously radiant.\n\n**Reverting to the Root**\nThe Dao/Way is fundamentally non-action, the Dharma natural,\nThe sage establishes images, borrowing names as circles.\nIn ordinary daily use, it is fully manifest—\nShatter the vessel, and you know the image precedes the Lord.\n\n**Diagram and Secrets

Medicines of the Golden Elixir**\n\nOuter medicine can cure illness and bestow longevity. Inner medicine can transcend the mundane and enter the formless from the formed. Generally, those who study the Dao must begin with outer medicine before naturally grasping inner medicine. The most exalted adepts, having long cultivated the root of virtue, are born with this knowledge—thus, they refine inner medicine without first refining outer medicine.\n\nInner medicine is non-action yet all-accomplishing; outer medicine is action with deliberate purpose. Inner medicine is formless and insubstantial yet truly existent; outer medicine has form and function yet is ultimately empty. Outer medicine pertains to the corporeal body; inner medicine pertains to the Dharma-body. Outer medicine is the Way of earthly immortals; inner medicine is the Way of water immortals. The perfection of both medicines is the Way of celestial immortals.\n\nOuter medicine completes destiny; inner medicine completes nature. The perfection of both medicines unites form and spirit in wondrous harmony.\n\n**Outer Medicine**\n- *First Pass*: Refining essence into qi—first, one must recognize *tiankui* (heavenly water) and swiftly gather it when it arises.\n- *Middle Pass*: Refining qi into spirit—harmonizing true breath, circulating through the six voids, reversing the flow from the *Taixuan* Pass to the *Tiangu* Cavity for union, then descending to the Yellow Chamber, entering the Central Palace. When *Qian* and *Kun* unite in *Gou*, a single drop falls into the Yellow Court.\n- *Upper Pass*: Refining spirit to return to emptiness—using the mind to refine thoughts is called the *Seven Returns*; emotions returning to nature is called the *Nine Returns*. Returning to nature is the *Nine Returns*.\n\n**Inner Medicine**\nInner medicine is the essence of refining spirit—uniting form and spirit in wondrous harmony to merge with the Dao. Inner medicine is the primordial, singular true yang, like the central line in the *Qian* hexagram, which, when united with *Kun*, becomes the *Kan* Water. This central line is originally *Qian* metal, also called \"metal within water,\" collectively named *zhi jing* (supreme essence). When this supreme essence solidifies, it reverts to the ancestral qi—the primordial, formless, true unity of original qi, not the qi of breath. As the central line of *Qian* unites with *Kun* to form *Kan*, the central yin of *Kun* enters *Qian* to form *Li*. The central yin of *Li* is originally *Kun* earth, hence called \"mercury within cinnabar.\"\n\nThe Dao gives birth to the One; the One gives birth to the Two; the Two gives birth to the Three; the Three gives birth to the myriad things.\nEmptiness transforms into spirit; spirit transforms into qi; qi transforms into essence; essence transforms into form.\nThe above is called the *sequential* process.\n\nThings contain the Three; the Three return to the Two; the Two return to the One.\nMyriad refinements perfect the supreme essence; essence transforms into qi; qi transforms into spirit.\nThe above is called the *reversal* process.\nThe *Scripture of the Elixir* states: \"Following the sequence, one becomes human; reversing it, one becomes the Elixir.\"\n\nThe three treasures—essence, qi, and spirit—are one in substance but two in function. What is substance? The great matter of the original Three Primes. What is function? The dual operations of inner and outer medicines.\n\n**Inner Medicine**\nPrimordial supreme essence, formless empty qi, indestructible original spirit.\n\n**Outer Medicine**\nInteractive essence, breath of inhalation and exhalation, contemplative spirit.\n\n- *First Refinement*: Essence transforms into qi—*First Pass*—deliberate action—extracting from *Kan* to fill *Li*.\n- *Second Refinement*: Qi transforms into spirit—*Middle Pass*—union of being and non-being—*Qian* and *Kun* opening and closing.\n- *Third Refinement*: Spirit returns to emptiness—*Upper Pass*—non-action.\n\nThese three stages of practice, when mastered, become one. If one possesses the single eye to perceive this, the great matters of the Three Teachings are complete. Should this not yet be so, study the following details carefully.\n\n**First Refinement: Essence Transforms into Qi**\nReturning to the Dao, one seeks the mysterious in the Water Palace.\nThe *Elixir Scriptures* state: *\"When *gui* arises, swiftly gather it—gazing afar, it cannot be tasted.\"*\nWhat is meant by \"gathering\"? It is the gathering that is no-gathering, called gathering.\nIf one truly gathers something, how can the single line within *Kan* ascend?\nEssence is the transformation of the primordial supreme numen; through movement, the body comes to be.\nThe supreme essence within the body is original yang—this is what one gathers.\nFor example, *Qian* is the primordial supreme numen; at its first movement, it joins with *Kun* to form *Kan*, which is the image of the supreme numen transforming into original essence.\n*Kan* is Water, and the single line within *Kan* is the original *Qian* Metal, provisionally called \"Metal within Water.\"\nMetal is the mother of Water, yet it resides within Water—thus it is said, \"the mother conceals the child’s embryo.\"\nThe subtle signs of gathering Lead cannot be described in words.\nThose who understand may observe the thunder within the earth, the return of the former kings, the closing of passes at the solstice when merchants and travelers cease, and the saying *\"the latter does not consider direction\"*—pondering these, one grasps more than half. The rest remains oral transmission.\n\n**Second Refinement: Qi Transforms into Spirit**\nIn the tradition of Śākya, this is cultivating samādhi in the *Li* Palace.\nThe *Elixir Scriptures* state: *\"True Earth restrains True Lead; True Lead restrains True Mercury. Lead and Mercury return to the Earth Cauldron—body and mind motionless, undisturbed.\"*\nThese words say all.\nOnce True Lead is obtained, what concern remains for True Mercury?\nThe essence of refining qi lies in movement: opening and closing, going and coming, ascending and descending—without cease.\nAt first, one employs intention; later, it becomes natural.\nEach inhalation and exhalation seizes a year’s creative power.\nThis is what the *Daodejing* means by: *\"The gate of the Mysterious Female is called the root of Heaven and Earth. Subtle and continuous, it seems to endure; its use is inexhaustible.\"*\nThose who understand may focus on the gate of *Qian* and *Kun* in the *Book of Changes*, and within *Fu* and *Gou*—here lies the essence of refining qi.\n\n**Third Refinement: Spirit Returns to Emptiness**\nAt this stage of practice, not a single word is needed.\nThe *Compass of the Three and Five* and the verses of Immortal Ziyang’s *Awakening to Reality* state:\n*\"Three, five, and one—just these three characters;\nThrough the ages, those who truly understand are rare.\nEast’s three and South’s two together make five;\nNorth’s one and West’s four share the same.\n*Wu* and *Ji* return to the generative number five;\nThe three families meet to form the infant.\nThe infant is one, containing true qi;\nTen months’ gestation completes the foundation of sagehood.\"*\nThese fifty-six words encompass all the Hundred Schools, the *Elixir Scriptures*, and the books of the Daoist canon.\nIf one possesses the single eye to perceive this, the work of study is complete. Should this not yet be so, consider the annotations below.\n\n*\"Three, five, and one—just these three characters\"*: the Three Primes and Five Phases as one qi.\n*\"Through the ages, those who truly understand are rare\"*: from antiquity to the present, few have known.\n*\"East’s three and South’s two together make five\"*: East’s three is Wood; South’s two is Fire. Wood generates Fire, Wood being Fire’s mother—two natures of one family, thus \"together make five.\"\n*\"North’s one and West’s four share the same\"*: North’s one is Water; West’s four is Metal. Metal generates Water, Metal being Water’s mother—two natures of one family, thus \"share the same.\"\n*\"Wu and Ji return to the generative number five\"*: the generative number of Earth is five. Five stands at the center without a pair, naturally forming one family.\n*\"The three families meet\"*: the Three Primes and Five Phases merge into one.\nThus it is said, *\"The three families meet to form the infant.\"*\nThe so-called infant is a provisional name for the meaning of pure unity—hence, *\"the infant is one, containing true qi.\"*\n*\"Ten months’ gestation completes the foundation of sagehood\"*: three hundred days of gestation, refining the two medicines of eight ounces—cooking, refining, completing, maturing—this is the great work of transcending the ordinary and entering sagehood.\nThus it is said, *\"completes the foundation of sagehood.\"*\nThis is spoken in terms of the individual body.\n\nThe East is Three, Wood—my nature.\nThe West is Four, Metal—my emotions.\nThe South is Two, Fire—my spirit.\nThe North is One, Water—my essence.\n\nNature is the master of the heart; the heart is the abode of spirit.\nNature and spirit are both bound to the heart—East Three and South Two together make Five.\nEssence is the master of the body; the body is the bond of emotions.\nEssence and emotions are both bound to the body—North One and West Four share as one.\n\nWu-ji, the central Earth, is the mind.\nThe Four Images and Five Phases are governed by the mind.\nThe mind has no counterpart—it is naturally one family.\n\nFor the practitioner of refinement:\nGathering body, heart, and mind naturally merges the Three Primes and Five Phases into one.\nAs the *Alchemical Writings* say: *\"Gathering body and heart is the harvesting of medicine.\"*\nThis is precisely what is meant.\n\nThe essential method for gathering body and heart lies in emptiness and stillness.\nEmpty the heart, and spirit unites with nature.\nStill the body, and essence and emotions become quiescent.\nWhen the mind is profoundly settled, the Three Primes merge as one.\nThis is what is called *\"the three flowers gather, the five qi ascend, the sacred embryo congeals.\"*\n\nWhen emotions harmonize with nature, it is called *\"Metal and Wood unite.\"*\nWhen essence merges with spirit, it is called *\"Water and Fire commingle.\"*\nWhen the mind is profoundly settled, it is called *\"the Five Phases complete.\"*\n\nAs the *Alchemical Writings* say:\n*\"Refining essence into qi is the first barrier—where the body does not move.*\n*Refining qi into spirit is the middle barrier—where the heart does not move.*\n*Refining spirit into emptiness is the highest barrier—where the mind does not move.\"*\n\nWhen the heart does not move, East Three and South Two together make Five.\nWhen the body does not move, North One and West Four share as one.\nWhen the mind does not move, Wu-ji returns to the generative number Five.\nWhen body, heart, and mind unite, the three families meet to form the infant.\n\nOne who achieves this has fulfilled the work of the Golden Elixir.\nThe great task of the immortals is complete.\n\nAs for the *Alchemical Writings’* various symbolic forms and diverse names,\nnone lie outside body, heart, and mind.\nYet for those who cannot immediately grasp the meaning,\nI have set forth alternative names, symbolic forms, and diagrams below—\nlet those with discerning eyes examine them closely.\n\nBody, heart, and mind are called the Three Families.\nEssence, qi, and spirit are called the Three Primes.\nEssence, spirit, soul, corporeal soul, and mind are called the Five Qi.\nLead, mercury, silver, cinnabar, and earth are called the Five Phases.\nThe meeting of the Three Families is called *\"the embryo’s perfection.\"*\nThe union of the Three Primes is called *\"the Elixir’s completion.\"*\n\nWritten on the birthday of Pure Yang in the third year of the Dade era,\nat Zhonghe Hermitage by the Luan River.\n*A Single Aperture of the Mysterious Pass—For My Disciples.*\n\nThe Mysterious Pass—a single aperture—is the most profound and essential mechanism. It is not the glabella, nor the fontanel, nor the navel, nor the bladder, nor the two kidneys, nor the space before the kidneys and behind the navel, nor the midpoint between the two kidneys. From the crown of the head to the heels of the feet, throughout the four great elements of the body, if one clings to any single location, one has already missed it. Yet one cannot depart from this body to seek it externally. Thus, the sages have simply pointed to the character *\"middle\"* to reveal it—this *\"middle\"* is precisely it.\n\nLet me offer a metaphor to make this easier to grasp. Consider a marionette: its hands and feet move, its hundred gestures shift—yet the marionette does not move itself; it is the strings that pull it. Though the strings are the mechanism, it is the puppeteer who controls them. Ah! Do you recognize this puppeteer? Cease your doubts, and I will tell you plainly: the marionette is this body; the strings are the Mysterious Pass; the puppeteer is the Master Within. The body’s hands and feet do not move of their own accord—it is the Mysterious Pass that sets them in motion. Yet though the Mysterious Pass moves, it is the Master Within who commands it. If you can recognize this moving mechanism, how could you fail to attain immortality?\n\n**Touchstone of Truth**\n\nThe Golden Elixir takes emptiness as its essence and clarity as its function—it is the supreme, most authentic, and wondrous Dao. Few in the world know it; fewer still practice it. Thus, the sages, in their compassionate power, opened the gate of skillful means, established names and forms, and inscribed them in the alchemical texts to guide later learners. Their intent was that those who come after might recite the words, illuminate the principles, silently comprehend the subtle currents, and thereby practice to swiftly ascend to the true realm. Yet later learners, failing to fathom these principles, cling to mere expedients, recklessly invoking a hundred interpretations, splintering the teachings into myriad fragments. They shatter the great Dao into crooked paths and side trails—three thousand six hundred in all—truly losing the transmission in the process.\n\nMoreover, today’s ignorant and shallow scholars recklessly annotate the sages’ scriptures, introducing even greater distortions. How can they not mislead those who come after? Even those of earnest aspiration cannot discern truth from falsehood—how pitiful this is! For this reason, I have composed this *Touchstone of Truth* to distinguish the genuine from the spurious, that all learners may avoid confusion, resolve all doubt, and directly transcend to the shore of the Dao.\n\nThe sagely master said:\n*\"Three thousand six hundred gates of Dao and method—*\n*Each clings to one as their root.*\n*Who knows this subtle and mysterious point?*\n*It lies beyond the three thousand six hundred gates.\"*\n\nI say: the ancestral masters, with the urgency of an old woman’s heart, composed such verses. If there are still those who hold such views, the entire earth would turn to gold. If not, one must test it for oneself.\n\nThus, it is written:\n**Nine Grades**\n\n**The Three Gradual Methods and the Three Vehicles**\n\nThe Three Gradual Methods comprise the Three Vehicles. The Supreme Vehicle is the peerless, most true, and wondrous Dao. The Nine Grades of Heterodox Practices are as follows:\n\n**Lower Three Grades**\nThe lowest of the lower grades includes: \"controlling women\" in the bedchamber, the Three Peaks and battle tactics, consuming breast milk before the furnace, using women as crucibles, menstrual blood as medicine, the birth canal as the place of bodily generation, and essence-blood as the great elixir’s foundation. Forging yin-yang swords, establishing the yin-intestine furnace, claiming women to be pure yang, and pointing to menstrual blood as the supreme treasure—ingesting it to achieve monthly restoration, employing nine women as nine crucibles, and pursuing nine years of ninefold refinement. Commanding boys and girls to copulate to gather their initial essence, extracting millet-like grains from the yin as the mysterious pearl. Then there are the \"golden flower,\" the \"golden spear,\" the seventy-two schools of fierce battle and victory, \"more in, less out,\" and \"nine shallow, one deep.\" Such perverse absurdities are called the \"mud-water elixir methods,\" numbering over three hundred. These are the most chaotic of paths, the lowest of the lower grades—utterly heterodox.\n\nFurther, there are eighty-four methods of \"joining,\" thirty-six kinds of \"yin extraction,\" using the placenta as the \"purple river chariot,\" refining urine into \"autumn stone,\" consuming one’s own essence for \"returning to the origin,\" and pinching the coccyx to \"seal the pass.\" Husband and wife copulate without emission, claiming it as \"non-leakage.\" Extracting women’s menstrual blood to make \"red pills,\" or refining the five metals and eight minerals into pellets for women to ingest, producing flesh-masses after ten months as the supreme medicine—consuming these. Such false arts, too numerous to list entirely, number over three hundred and belong to the middle of the lower grades—external heterodoxy.\n\nThen there are the various grades of elixir furnaces and fires, heating the five metals and eight minerals, manipulating mercury with lead, \"pointing to the thatch\" and \"burning the mountain,\" stirring ashes and tending flames. As for external medicines like \"spirit cinnabar,\" the \"three submissions\" and \"five counterfeits,\" and the methods of ingesting metals, minerals, herbs, and woods—over four hundred in total—these belong to the highest of the lower grades, yet remain external heterodoxy.\n\nThe lower three grades together comprise over a thousand methods, practiced by those greedy for lust and profit.\n\n**Middle Three Grades**\nThe lowest of the middle grades includes: fasting to avoid grain, enduring cold and consuming filth, ingesting pepper and wood, sunning the back and lying on ice, observing daily fasts, or adopting peculiar diets—some as \"pure fasts,\" others with bizarre foods, drinking without intoxication as proof, reducing food for \"withdrawal and replenishment,\" avoiding the five flavors for the \"three whites,\" or eschewing cooked food entirely. Some drink wine and eat meat without harming life, calling it \"non-action,\" or perform outlandish feats like \"overturning seas.\" These belong to the lowest of the middle grades.\n\nSwallowing mist and absorbing qi, gathering the essence of the sun and moon, ingesting the light of stars and the qi of the five directions, or drawing the qi of water and fire. Some engage in visualization and contemplation, roaming the nine provinces as practice, or imagine the two qi within the body transforming into a man and woman, mimicking human coupling for harmony. All such visualizations and vain methods belong to the middle of the middle grades.\n\nTransmitting the Three Refuges and Five Precepts, reciting and practicing scriptures, propagating faith to seek karmic rewards, undertaking pilgrimages, pursuing the \"ten faiths\" of emptiness, the \"three intervals\" and \"nine connections,\" worshipping stars and bowing to the Dipper. Some maintain silence, perform labor, or uphold external disciplines. All these are \"with effort\" and belong to the highest of the middle grades, gradually approaching the Dao.\n\nThe middle three grades together number over a thousand methods. Practiced diligently, they lead to gradual improvement, surpassing those who merely dabble.\n\n**Upper Three Grades**\nThe lowest of the upper grades includes: stabilizing observation and inspecting form, visualization and breath regulation, rubbing and adjusting. The \"Eight Brocades,\" the \"Six Healing Sounds,\" gazing at the crown, guarding the navel’s root, swallowing saliva, stirring divine water. Some chew wood a thousand times to enliven, or point to the tongue as the \"crimson dragon,\" rubbing the body to generate heat as \"fire timing,\" or exhaling once and massaging nine times to seek longevity. Some refine thick saliva into the \"true seed,\" guard the elixir field, or lift the external kidneys. Even \"boiling the sea\" and observing the nose, using saliva, essence, and spittle as medicine—these belong to the lowest of the upper grades.\n\nHolding breath and circulating qi, bending and stretching to guide, massaging the waist and kidneys, guarding the glabella, moving the eyes, swaying the spine, and revolving the navel wheel. Some take the eyes as the sun and moon, the space between the brows as the \"mysterious pass,\" or knock teeth as the \"heavenly gate.\" Some imagine the primordial spirit exiting and entering the crown, dream of wandering immortal realms, silently pay homage to the Emperor Above, mistake drowsiness for \"entering samadhi,\" count breaths as \"fire timing,\" or visualize the heart and kidneys as black and white qi merging for \"completion.\" These belong to the middle of the upper grades.\n\nRefining essence and circulating qi, gathering the three fires to the navel, harmonizing the five viscera, the sixteen visualization methods, securing the elixir field, ingesting the \"central yellow qi,\" returning the three fields, replenishing the brain and restoring essence, lifting the \"golden well\" twice, the \"double passes\" of the spine, grasping firmly and inward gazing—various refinements and circulations belong to the highest of the upper grades.\n\nThe upper three grades together number over a thousand methods. Practiced by those of middling capacity, they may also prevent illness.\n\n**The Three Gradual Methods and the Three Vehicles**\nThe Lower Vehicle takes the body and mind as the crucible and furnace, essence and qi as the medicinal ingredients, the heart and kidneys as water and fire, the five viscera as the five phases, the liver and lungs as the dragon and tiger, and essence as the true seed. The years, months, days, and hours serve as the fire timing, swallowing saliva for irrigation as \"bathing,\" the mouth and nose as the \"three essentials,\" the space before the kidneys and behind the navel as the \"mysterious pass,\" and the fusion of the five phases as the \"elixir’s completion.\" This is the method of ease and joy, comprising over a hundred practices. If one can forget passion, it may also nourish life. Though similar to the upper three grades, its applications differ.\n\nThe Middle Vehicle takes heaven and earth as the crucible and vessel, kan and li as water and fire, the crow and hare as the medicinal ingredients, spirit, essence, soul, and intention as the five phases, body and mind as the dragon and tiger, and qi as the true seed. The cold and heat of a year serve as the fire timing, dharma-water for irrigation as \"bathing,\" the inner realm not leaking outward and the outer realm not entering as \"sealing,\" the \"great abyss,\" \"crimson palace,\" and \"essence chamber\" as the \"three essentials,\" the \"mud pill\" as the \"mysterious pass,\" and the fusion of spirit and essence as the \"elixir’s completion.\"\n\nThis Middle Vehicle method of life-nourishment comprises several dozen practices, largely similar to the Lower Vehicle with minor differences. If practiced without negligence, it may also lead to longevity and enduring vision.\n\nThe Upper Vehicle takes heaven and earth as the crucible and furnace, the sun and moon as water and fire, yin and yang as the mechanism of transformation, lead, mercury, silver, cinnabar, and earth as the five phases, nature and emotions as the dragon and tiger, and thought as the true seed. Refining thought with the heart serves as the fire timing, stilling thought as nurturing the fire, containing light as sealing, subduing inner demons as field combat, body, mind, and intention as the three essentials, the celestial heart as the mysterious pass, emotions returning to nature as the elixir’s completion, and harmonious qi steaming as bathing. This is the Upper Vehicle’s path of life extension, similar in form to the Middle Vehicle but differing in application, comprising over a dozen practices. If a superior practitioner cultivates it with unwavering consistency, they may attain the Dao of immortality.\n\nThe Supreme Vehicle—The Supreme Vehicle is the peerless, most authentic, and wondrous Dao. It takes the Great Void as the crucible, the Supreme Ultimate as the furnace, purity and stillness as the elixir’s foundation, non-action as the elixir’s mother, nature and life as lead and mercury, and concentration and wisdom as water and fire. Curbing desire and restraining anger serve as the union of water and fire, the unity of nature and emotions as the convergence of metal and wood, purifying the heart and cleansing thoughts as bathing, preserving sincerity and stabilizing intention as sealing, precepts, concentration, and wisdom as the three essentials, the center as the mysterious pass, illuminating the heart as verification, perceiving nature as coagulation, the fusion of the three origins as the sacred embryo, the merging of nature and life into one as the elixir’s completion, the body beyond the body as rebirth, and shattering emptiness as attainment. This is the wondrous essence of the Supreme Vehicle, which the most accomplished practitioners may cultivate. When merit is fulfilled and virtue perfected, they directly transcend to the perfect and sudden, achieving sublime form and spirit, uniting with the true Dao.\n\n*End of Volume Two of the Zhonghe Collection*\n*Volume Three of the Zhonghe Collection*\n\n**By Li Daochun Yuan-su of Dulian Qing’an Yingchan, Compiled by Disciple Sun’an Baochan Cai Zhiyi**\n\n**Dialogue Records**\n\n**Jie’an Qiongchan Zi Cheng Andao asked about the Dao of the Three Teachings as One**\n\nYingchan Zi was in quiet sitting within the Toad Grotto. That night, the cold light was pure, and the qi was truly limpid enough to scoop.\n\nThe disciple Qiongchan Zi, deeply pondering the great matter of life and death, revered the immortals and could not but aspire to them, and could not but devote himself to cultivation. Bowing his head, he asked: \"Your disciple has often heard that since ancient times, the supreme sages and lofty perfected ones, as well as the immortals of past dynasties, all attained the Dao through cultivating the real. They necessarily took lead and mercury as the root and stem of the golden elixir. But what are lead and mercury?\"\n\nThe Master said: \"Lead and mercury are the beginning of Heaven and Earth, the mother of the myriad things, and the foundation of the golden elixir. They are not common lead, black tin, quicksilver, or cinnabar. Alas! Those who err do not know the true mystery. They privately conjecture and mislead later learners, wasting years and delaying their entire lives—how pitiable! If they do not encounter a true teacher’s illumination, all their efforts are in vain. The Perfected One of Purple Yang said: *Though your wisdom surpasses Yan and Min, without a true teacher, do not rashly guess.* This is precisely what he meant. Now I will point it out for you: true lead and true mercury are none other than body and heart. The sagely teacher said: *The two words ‘body’ and ‘heart’—they are the medicine, they are the fire.* He also said: *To know where the medicine is produced, only in the southwest is the homeland.* The southwest is Kun. Kun pertains to the body, and the essence within the body is the yang within yin. Like the single yang line of Qian entering Kun to form Kan, outwardly yin yet inwardly yang, outwardly soft yet inwardly firm, outwardly Kun yet inwardly Qian—within Kan Water there is Qian Metal, so it is forcibly named *metal within water*. Mercury is the qi within the heart, the yin within yang. Like the single yin line of Kun entering Qian to form Li, outwardly yang yet inwardly yin, outwardly firm yet inwardly soft, outwardly Qian yet inwardly Kun—within Li Fire there is Kun Earth, so it is forcibly named *mercury within cinnabar*. The wondrous resonance of essence and qi is thus forcibly named and symbolized as lead and mercury, so that learners may know there is substance and function. Pursuing this further, nothing lies beyond the two words ‘body’ and ‘heart.’ After body and heart unite as one, lead and mercury both cease to be.\n\n**Question:** What is *drawing out and adding in*?\n**Answer:** When the body does not move and qi is stabilized, this is called *drawing out*. When the heart does not move and spirit is stabilized, this is called *adding in*. When body and heart do not move, spirit congeals and qi coalesces—this is called *returning to the origin*. Thus, taking the yang from Kan to supplement the yin in Li and form Qian is called *drawing out lead and adding in mercury*.\n\n**Question:** What is *simmering and refining*?\n**Answer:** When body and heart are on the verge of uniting yet have not united, if even the slightest disturbance arises, one counters it with a resolute heart—this is *martial refining*. After body and heart have united and essence and qi have merged, one guards it with a gentle and harmonious heart—this is *civil simmering*. There is no other principle here; simply subduing body and heart is *simmering lead and refining mercury*. Forgetting emotions to nurture nature, emptying the heart to nourish spirit, all conditions suddenly ceasing, all thoughts completely clarified, body and heart unmoving, spirit congealed and qi coalesced—this is called the *foundation of the elixir*, metaphorically termed the *sacred embryo*. All these various names merely describe gathering emotions into nature. When nature is quiescent and emotions are stilled, one illumines the original self, embraces the root and returns to emptiness, and restores the mandate—this is called *elixir completion*, metaphorically termed *rebirth*.\n\n**Question:** The various elixir classics say that the subtlety of cultivation lies in the *mysterious pass*. But where exactly is the mysterious pass?\n**Answer:** The mysterious pass is the most profound and wondrous mechanism. How could it have a fixed location? If you fixate on the body, it is not so; if you seek it outside this body, it is also not so. Clinging to the body is attachment to form; clinging to externals is attachment to things. The mysterious pass is simply where the four great elements and five phases do not adhere. Now I will set forth a metaphor to make it easier for you to understand. Consider a marionette: its hands and feet move, performing all manner of dances, yet it all depends on the strings and pulleys, truly controlled by the master. The marionette is like the four great elements constituting the human body; the strings are like the mysterious pass; the master pulling the strings is like the original true nature. Without strings, the marionette cannot move; without the mysterious pass, a person also cannot move. You must simply, in the twelve double-hours of the day, whether walking, standing, sitting, or lying down, apply effort inwardly and seek it: in speech or silence, seeing or hearing—what is it? When body and heart are tranquil and settled, in the moment of true mechanism and wondrous response, you will naturally perceive it. The *Appended Judgments* of the *Book of Changes* says: *Quiescent and unmoving*—this is the substance of the mysterious pass. *Stimulated, then penetrating*—this is the function of the mysterious pass. Once you perceive the mysterious pass, having attained it once, medicine, fire times, the three origins, and the eight trigrams are all within it. If people fixate on a physical location for the mysterious pass, even if they exert effort and endure hardship, their endeavor will ultimately fail. If I were to directly point it out, I fear you would not grasp it, nor could you use it. You must perceive it yourself. It is like the precelestial learning of the Confucians, which also requires silent recognition. Mencius said: *The vast qi fills the space between Heaven and Earth*—he called it *hard to describe*. Is not the subtlety of what is hard to describe the mysterious pass? Moreover, like the Buddhists who do not rely on written words, transmitting beyond the teachings, enabling people to apprehend it with spirit and understand it with intention—this is called the *wondrousness of what is not transmitted*. One who knows this principle can then achieve unity that penetrates all things.\n\n**Question:** Some say that revering Buddhism and cultivating the Dao can sever life and death and escape the wheel of rebirth, while studying Confucianism can fulfill human relationships but cannot resolve life and death. Is this not a difference among the Three Teachings?\n\nHe replied: How can one who grasps the principle be troubled by life and death? Consider this: exhausting principle and fully realizing one’s nature to the utmost of destiny; tracing origins to return to endings, comprehending all things in their entirety—then one understands the discourse on life and death. Thus, the learning of nature and destiny is truly the orthodox transmission of Confucianism. If one thoroughly penetrates principle and attains clear understanding, how could one fail to sever life and death and escape the wheel of rebirth?\n\nMoreover, when Fuxi first drew the *Yi*, he embodied Heaven to establish teachings and transformed people through the Dao—there was no division among the Three Teachings. As it is said: *August Heaven has no second Dao; the sage has no dual heart.* When he first drew the single line, it symbolized the Supreme Ultimate. With one came two, symbolizing the Two Modes. One is yang, the other yin—*the alternation of yin and yang is called the Dao.* Looking up, he observed the heavens and drew a line to symbolize Heaven; looking down, he examined the earth and drew a line to symbolize Earth; in the middle, he drew a line to symbolize Man. Thus, three lines form *Qian*, symbolizing the Three Powers. Two *Qian* broken form *Kun*, symbolizing the Six Directions. Hence it is said: *The Dao of Heaven is established as yin and yang; the Dao of Earth is established as soft and hard; the Dao of Man is established as benevolence and righteousness.* Combining the Three Powers and doubling them, six lines form *Kun*.\n\nSpeaking of the human body: the Dao of Heaven is established as yin and yang—this is the single spirit and qi of the heart; the Dao of Earth is established as soft and hard—this is the physical form of the body; the Dao of Man is established as benevolence and righteousness—this is the emotions and nature of the mind. Heart, body, and mind symbolize the Three Powers of *Qian*; spirit, qi, nature, emotions, and physical form symbolize the Six Directions of *Kun*. The *Yi* says: *Far-off, one takes from things; near, one takes from oneself.* This is what it means.\n\nSomeone asked: The *Xici* says *six lines form a hexagram*—why do you say *six lines form Kun*?\n\nHe replied: You do not yet understand. When it speaks of six lines forming a hexagram, it refers to King Wen’s doubling of the trigrams. Before King Wen doubled the trigrams, how could there be no Three Powers and Six Directions? The former worthies said: *The Dao of Heaven is established as yin and yang—this is Heaven’s Qian and Kun; the Dao of Earth is established as soft and hard—this is Earth’s Qian and Kun; the Dao of Man is established as benevolence and righteousness—this is Man’s Qian and Kun.* Extending this reasoning, the two hexagrams *Qian* and *Kun* encompass the Three Powers and Six Directions—how could this be explained by the doubling of trigrams? What is called *six lines form a hexagram* refers to the post-heaven hexagrams after the doubling.\n\nSomeone asked: If the Three Powers and Six Directions were already complete before the doubling of trigrams, then the *Xici* says: *Those who created implements esteemed their images.* Was it not that implements were made according to images, and images were established to create implements?\n\nHe replied: Implements were made according to images.\n\nSomeone asked: From the Three Sovereigns onward, sages created implements all based on the doubled hexagrams. If implements were made according to images, how could there be a name for doubled hexagrams before King Wen doubled the *Yi*?\n\nHe replied: Not so. The former worthies said: *You must believe that before the lines were drawn, the Yi already existed.* Thus, before King Wen doubled the trigrams, all sixty-four hexagrams were complete.\n\nSomeone asked: If hexagrams were not doubled, how could the sixty-four hexagrams be obtained?\n\nHe replied: They arise from the transformation of hexagrams. One hexagram transforms into eight, and eight transform into sixty-four. For example, in the *Qian* hexagram’s three lines, the upper two are young yang, and the lower one is old yang. Extending this, the *Xun* hexagram emerges—yang transforms into yin, *Qian*’s *Xun*, *Heaven-Wind Gou*. Taking this one hexagram as an example, all hexagrams follow the same pattern.\n\nSomeone asked: If hexagrams were not doubled yet still produced sixty-four hexagrams, why did King Wen double them?\n\nHe replied: The sixty-four hexagrams arising from undoubled hexagrams were Fuxi’s heart-method, the orthodox transmission of the Dao lineage, guiding learners of later generations to enter the gate of sages together. The sixty-four hexagrams arising from doubled hexagrams were established by King Wen and the Zhou Confucians to set the standard for the people, rectify human relationships, enable people to pursue good fortune and avoid misfortune, and establish the eternal norms of ruler and minister, father and son. Thus, the learning of nature and destiny dare not be lightly expounded in words, nor can one bear to conceal this Dao. Confucius subtly revealed it in the *Xici*, and Master Zhou Dunyi elucidated it in the *Taiji Tushuo*. This is to allow later learners to thoroughly chew and digest it, attaining understanding on their own—thus this learning will not perish in transmission.\n\nSomeone asked: What does *the alternation of yin and yang is called the Dao* mean?\n\nHe replied: Yin and yang are *Qian* and *Kun*. *Qian* and *Kun* emerge from the Supreme Ultimate. The Supreme Ultimate divides, and the Two Modes are established. The Two Modes are Heaven and Earth. It does not speak of Heaven and Earth but of *Qian* and *Kun* because it values their function over their substance.\n\nSomeone asked: *Qian* is yang, *Kun* is yin—why then say Heaven and Earth?\n\nHe replied: Heaven and Earth are *Qian* and *Kun*; *Qian* and *Kun* are yin and yang; yin and yang are one Supreme Ultimate; the Supreme Ultimate is originally the Ultimateless. Speaking in terms of the Supreme Ultimate, it is called Heaven and Earth; speaking in terms of the *Yi*, it is called *Qian* and *Kun*; speaking in terms of the Dao, it is called yin and yang. Speaking of the human body: Heaven and Earth are the physical form; *Qian* and *Kun* are nature and emotions; yin and yang are spirit and qi. Speaking in terms of symbolic correspondences: Heaven is the dragon, Earth the tiger; *Qian* the horse, *Kun* the ox; yang the crow, yin the hare. Speaking in terms of the Golden Elixir: Heaven is the cauldron, Earth the furnace; *Qian* is metal, *Kun* is earth; yin is mercury, yang is lead. Spoken of separately, they have various names; spoken of together, they are the alternation of yin and yang. Those who cultivate immortality and refine lead and mercury into the elixir are uniting body and mind to return to their original state, merging yin and yang to revert to the Supreme Ultimate.\n\nSomeone asked: What is *three-five-one*?\n\nHe replied: The Three Origins and Five Phases. East three and south two form one five; north one and west four form two fives; central earth is three fives—this is called *three-five.*\n\nSpeaking in terms of the human body: nature as three and spirit as two form one five; emotion as four and essence as one form two fives; intent as five is three fives. When the three fives unite as one, they return to the Supreme Ultimate; when body, mind, and intent merge as one, the sacred embryo is formed. The Perfected One of Purple Yang said: *\"Three-five-one\"* are but three words—it is the Three Origins, Five Phases, and unified qi. From ancient times to now, those who truly understand this are rare. The world seldom knows it. East three and south two together form five: east three is nature, south two is spirit. North one and west four share the same principle: north one is essence, west four is emotion. *Wu* and *ji* return to the generative number five—earth’s number is five, which is intent. When the three families meet, the infant is formed. The three families are body, mind, and intent; the infant is the functional result of the three fives uniting as one. The infant is one that contains true qi; the infant is another name for the True One, the Supreme One containing truth. After ten months, the embryo is complete, and the foundation of sagehood is laid. With ten months of effort, one sheds the mortal embryo and transcends the ordinary to enter sagehood. Pursuing the Way of the Golden Elixir in this manner truly establishes the foundation of sagehood.\n\nSomeone asked: The *Xici* says, \"Heaven and Earth establish their positions, and the Changes move within them.\" What does this mean?\n\nHe replied: Heaven and Earth establish their positions, and humans are born between them—this is called the Three Powers. Thus, humans and all things are born and ceaselessly transform. It does not speak of humans and things but of the *Changes* because the sage speaks of *Qian* and *Kun* as the gate of the *Changes*, adapting to the Dao through constant transformation. In the Golden Elixir, taking *Qian* and *Kun* as the cauldron and vessel is like Heaven and Earth establishing their positions; taking yin and yang as the mechanism of transformation is the *Changes* moving within them. From the beginning, gathering the medicine is inexhaustible, and the fire times proceed without cease.\n\nSomeone asked: Opening the door is called *Qian*, closing the door is called *Kun*, and the alternation of opening and closing is called *change*. What does this mean?\n\nHe replied: The alternation of opening and closing is the alternation of movement and stillness. *Qian* is yang, *Kun* is yin—like the opening and closing of a door, it is the gate of *Qian* and *Kun* in the *Changes*. Moreover, as yin and yang mutually move and rest, their mechanism operates unceasingly. *Yuan*, *heng*, *li*, and *zhen* determine the four seasons and complete the yearly cycle—this is *change* and *ease*. The supreme Dao and spirit-qi blend indistinguishably, pervading the Three Powers and the myriad things. Opening and closing are endless, reaching vastness and exhausting subtlety. Speaking of the human body: breathing is the example. Exhaling connects to the root of Heaven—this is called *opening*; inhaling connects to the root of Earth—this is called *closing*. One exhalation and one inhalation transform and generate the golden liquid—this is called *change*. Opening and closing, exhalation and inhalation, are the gate of the Mysterious Female, the root of Heaven and Earth. The so-called breathing is not the breath of mouth and nose but the true rest of opening and closing.\n\nSomeone asked: *\"The Dao of Qian forms the male; the Dao of Kun forms the female.\"* What does this mean?\n\nHe replied: *Qian* is the father, *Kun* is the mother. The initial yang line of *Qian* interacts with *Kun* to form *Zhen*, and *Zhen*’s first line yields the male—this is called the eldest son. The initial yin line of *Kun* interacts with *Qian* to form *Xun*, and *Xun*’s first line yields the female—this is called the eldest daughter. The middle yang line of *Qian* interacts with *Kun* to form *Kan*, and *Kan*’s second line yields the male—this is called the middle son. The middle yin line of *Kun* interacts with *Qian* to form *Li*, and *Li*’s second line yields the female—this is called the middle daughter. The third yang line of *Qian* interacts with *Kun* to form *Gen*, and *Gen*’s third line yields the male—this is called the youngest son. The third yin line of *Kun* interacts with *Qian* to form *Dui*, and *Dui*’s third line yields the female—this is called the youngest daughter. *Qian* produces three sons, *Kun* produces three daughters, and together *Qian* and *Kun* give birth to six children—these are the eight trigrams.\n\nSpeaking of the body: at the moment of conception, one receives the essence of father and mother to form this body. This essence is metaphorically called *heavenly ren* and *earthly gui* in the elixir classics. At the initial union, if *heavenly ren* arrives first and *earthly gui* follows, *gui* envelops *ren* to form a male; if *earthly gui* arrives first and *heavenly ren* follows, *ren* envelops *gui* to form a female. If *ren* and *gui* arrive simultaneously, a twin birth results. If *ren* arrives first and *gui* is delayed, or *gui* arrives first and *ren* is delayed, conception does not occur. Thus it is said: *\"The Dao of Qian forms the male; the Dao of Kun forms the female.\"* Now, *heavenly ren* and *earthly gui* are the primordial essence and qi of Heaven and Earth. They are also what the elixir classics call *Kan*-*wu* and *Li*-*ji*, alternate names for lead and mercury. When regulated externally, they form a person; when cultivated internally, they form the elixir. The world does not know that whether one has sons or daughters is truly determined by fate and not by human effort. If one does not cut off lust and desires but instead engages in self-cultivation only after essence and vitality are exhausted, one will die young—this is deeply lamentable. How could they know that those who have few desires and bear sons or daughters are noble and long-lived, while those who have many desires and bear sons or daughters are base and short-lived?\n\nSomeone asked: *\"That which is above form is called the Dao; that which is below form is called the vessel.\"* What does this mean?\n\nHe replied: That which is above form has no physical substance; that which is below form has body and function. That without physical substance pertains to nature and mercury; that with body and function pertains to destiny and lead. In sum, they do not go beyond body and mind.\n\nSomeone asked: The sage *\"uses the Changes to wash the mind and retreats to conceal it in secrecy.\"* What is this *secrecy*?\n\nHe replied: It is the utmost sincerity. The principles of the *Changes* reach vastness and exhaust subtlety. The sage savors their meaning, washes the mind and purifies thoughts, concealing them in perfect sincerity.\n\nSomeone asked: The *Book of Documents* says, *\"The human mind is perilous; the Dao-mind is subtle. Only with utmost refinement and singular focus can one truly hold to the center.\"* How does one hold to the *center*?\n\nHe replied: *Hold* is a term of certainty. *Center* is the exact middle. The Dao-mind is subtle and hard to perceive; the human mind is perilous and unstable. Even the most realized person has a human mind, and even the most foolish has a Dao-mind. If one can always keep the mind upright and centered, this subtlety is difficult to perceive.\n\nIf the mind slightly deviates and loses the center, this is why it becomes perilous and unstable. For those who cultivate immortality, choosing one path and holding to it unwaveringly, always grasping the center, naturally transforms peril into stability and subtlety into clarity. The Golden Elixir uses the center as the Mysterious Pass—this follows the same principle.\n\nSomeone asked: *\"Heaven’s burden bears all things without sound, without scent.\"* How is this so?\nHe replied: When utmost sincerity shines forth, though no sound may be heard nor scent perceived, the Dao of Heaven cannot be concealed. As the *Daoist Scripture* says, *\"Vast and profoundly mysterious\"*—this is the perfection of truth.\n\nSomeone asked: *\"Unknowing, unperceiving, yet following the decree of the Emperor.\"* How is this so?\nHe replied: The sage is born with knowledge, silently aligning with the principles of Heaven. This is what is meant by *\"without thought, one attains; without effort, one hits the mark\"*—achieving the Dao of effortless spontaneity. This is what the *Doctrine of the Mean* calls *\"sincerity leading to clarity.\"* To speak of *\"clarity leading to sincerity\"* is precisely the teaching of the sage. Those who study the Dao, if endowed with deep karmic roots, directly comprehend their nature and naturally fulfill their destiny—this is *\"born with knowledge.\"* Those with shallow roots cannot directly grasp their nature; they must be taught and enter through effort, progressing from existence to non-existence, from the coarse to the subtle. Thus, they first fulfill their destiny before comprehending their nature—this is *\"learning to know.\"*\n\nSomeone asked: *The Master ate coarse food, drank plain water, rested his head on his bent arm, yet found joy therein.* Where did the Master’s joy lie?\nHe replied: The Master’s joy was in Heaven, and what he knew was destiny. Thus, he *\"found joy in Heaven and knew destiny, free from care.\"* Even when besieged by the people of Kuang, he still played the zither and sang for his own delight, never far from the *Changes*. Through cultivating the self, he once more perceived the heart of Heaven and Earth, exhausting principle and fulfilling nature to reach destiny—this is the subtlety of the Golden Elixir.\n\nSomeone asked: *How did Yanzi find joy in his simple bamboo bowl and gourd ladle?*\nHe replied: Yanzi grasped the Master’s principle of *\"finding joy in Heaven and knowing destiny, free from care,\"* and thus his joy remained unchanged. His *\"feigned foolishness,\"* his *\"fasting of the mind\"* and *\"sitting in forgetfulness,\"* his *\"dimming of hearing and sight\"* and *\"discarding of wisdom and thought\"*—even in frequent poverty, this too is the subtlety of the Golden Elixir.\n\nSomeone asked: *Zengzi wore tattered hemp robes yet sang with a voice that filled Heaven and Earth, so that even the Son of Heaven could not make him a subject nor the feudal lords befriend him.* How was this so?\nHe replied: Zengzi’s marvel lay in his *\"single affirmation,\"* where both speech and hearing were forgotten. Thus, he mastered the Dao of *\"cultivating the self, ordering the family, governing the state, and pacifying the world\"*—the unifying principle.\n\nSomeone asked: *When Zilu asked about death, the Master replied, \"If you do not yet understand life, how can you understand death?\"* How is this so?\nHe replied: Life and death are as constant as day and night. Knowing day exists, one knows night exists. As the *Changes* says: *\"Tracing beginnings and returning to endings, one understands the discourse on life and death.\"* The *Elixir Scriptures* say: *\"Before father and mother were born, this is the foundation of the Golden Elixir.\"* The Buddhists ask: *\"Before this body existed, where was one’s nature?\"* Seeking thus, the entry points of the Three Teachings converge. One must trace the origin to know the end, follow the stream to know the source. If one thoroughly investigates this body—whence it comes and whither it goes—life and death are naturally understood. Have you studied the *Diagram of the Supreme Ultimate*? What existed before the Supreme Ultimate divided?\n\nSomeone asked: *Before the Supreme Ultimate divided, its form was like an egg. What lay beyond the egg?*\nHe replied: The Great Void. When all people receive qi, their forms are undifferentiated, like an egg. After birth, nature and destiny are established, and all beyond the body is the Great Void.\n\nSomeone asked: *When a person is in the mother’s womb, do they possess nature?*\nHe replied: The womb is filthy and impure—how could the numinous nature abide there?\nFurther asked: *At five or seven months of pregnancy, the fetus suddenly stirs—is this not nature?*\nHe replied: It is not nature, but merely qi. While in the womb, one breathes with the mother; upon leaving, nature and destiny are established, and one possesses their own Heaven and Earth. Consider a snake cut in two: the front still moves, the tail still lives. Or a crab cooked until done, yet a discarded leg still twitches—is this nature? Investigate this principle, and you will know it is qi moving, not nature.\n\nSomeone asked: *The saying goes, \"My Dao is unified by one principle.\"* How is this so?\nHe replied: The sage speaks of the single principle within the body, which can unify the Three Powers, the Three Teachings, and all things. As the Buddhists say, *\"no self, no others, no sentient beings, no lifespan,\"* and the Daoists say, *\"comprehending the ten thousand things is complete\"*—all are unified by one principle.\n\nSomeone asked: *When the World-Honored One held up a flower before the assembly, only Kāśyapa smiled faintly. The World-Honored One said, \"I possess the treasury of the true Dharma-eye, the wondrous mind of nirvana, and now entrust it to Mahākāśyapa.\"* What did his faint smile signify?\nHe replied: When the World-Honored One held up the flower, none in the assembly perceived the Buddha’s mind—only Kāśyapa saw its subtlety and thus smiled. Therefore, the World-Honored One transmitted the wondrous principle beyond the mind to Kāśyapa.\n\nSomeone asked: *Bodhidharma came from the West without relying on written words, directly pointing to the human mind to see nature and attain Buddhahood. What does \"seeing nature\" mean?*\nHe replied: Bodhidharma used the wondrous principle of true emptiness to directly point to the human mind. *\"Seeing nature\"* means turning the emotions of things to emptiness, thereby naturally perceiving one’s nature. How could it depend on transmission through brush and tongue?\n\nSomeone asked: *Confucians have the *Prior Heaven Changes*, Buddhists have the *Prajñā Sūtra*, and Daoists have the *Scripture of Numinous Treasure*—are these not written words?*\nHe replied: No. All are sages expressing the ineffable through words, revealing the Dao of true constancy. The Buddhist canon, with its vast collection of scriptures, records, and discourses on karma; the Confucian Nine Classics, Three Commentaries, and the hundred schools; the Daoist *Cavernous Mystery* scriptures and various elixir texts—these are the pathways to entering the Dao, the ladder to transcendence.\n\nWhen one reaches the ultimate state, not even a single word is needed. Your many questions are but a raft for crossing the river. The step beyond lies in seeking beyond words and phrases. If, through stumbling or collision, you awaken and penetrate through, you return to the Great Ultimate—perfectly luminous, aware, and illuminating; empty yet spiritually penetrating; with both nature and life complete, form and spirit equally wondrous; and your body one with the void. To stand shoulder to shoulder with immortals and buddhas is then no difficult feat.\n\nSomeone asked: *You say the three teachings share a single principle—this is most enlightening. Yet Buddhists speak of nirvāṇa, while Daoists speak of \"shedding the mortal coil.\" These seem different.*\nHe replied: *Nirvāṇa and \"shedding the mortal coil\" are but one and the same principle. \"Shedding the mortal coil\" means casting off the ordinary body—is this not nirvāṇa? Just as Daoists refine essence into qi, qi into spirit, and spirit into emptiness—embracing the root and returning to the void—this is identical in principle to the Buddhist return to emptiness, with no difference whatsoever.*\n\nAnother asked: *After shedding the mortal coil, is there still transformation?*\nHe replied: *There is indeed transformation. The sage says: \"A body beyond the body is not yet extraordinary; only when the void is shattered does the full truth appear.\" Thus, after shedding the mortal coil, one must stand firmly on the ground until one’s body becomes one with the void—only then is the task complete. For the Buddha speaks of \"true emptiness,\" the Confucian of \"non-action,\" and the Daoist of \"spontaneity\"—all are embracing the root and returning to the origin, becoming one with the Great Void. How could those who cling to partial truths ever grasp this all-pervading Dao?*\n\nJie’an remarked: *Master, you have attained the wondrous Dao of the Golden Elixir and harmonized the profound mysteries of the three teachings. Your answers to questions are supremely subtle and wondrous. How could I dare keep this secret? I shall have it printed and shared with those of like aspiration to awaken together. Like the Sui pearl and Zhao jade, those with discernment will recognize its worth.*\n\n**Zhao Ding’an’s Questions**\nThe Master said: *The ancestral masters and perfected sages of past ages possessed the supreme, most true Dao, which they transmitted to save people in the world. Do you know of this?*\nDing’an replied: *Your disciple, newly entered into the mysterious gate, is utterly foolish and dull. By your grace in accepting me, I count this the fortune of a thousand lifetimes. Of the supreme, most true Dao, I truly know nothing—pray, Master, enlighten me.*\nThe Master said: *The supreme, most true Dao is that which is beyond all that can be surpassed, the most profound of the profound, without form yet forming all, spontaneously so—this is what is called the ultimate and most wondrous. The sages gave it the forced name of \"Dao.\" Since ancient times, all transcendent immortals have attained realization through this—none have cultivated and verified it by any other means. From mouth to mouth, from heart to heart across the generations, the oral transmission of the Golden Elixir’s essentials is none other than this supreme, most true and wondrous Dao.*\n\nDing’an asked: *The supreme, most true mystery is likened to the Golden Elixir—what is its principle?*\nThe Master said: *\"Gold\" signifies hardness; \"elixir\" signifies roundness. Buddhists liken it to \"perfect enlightenment,\" Confucians to the \"Great Ultimate.\" It is no other thing—only the original, single numinous spirit. The original true nature is indestructible through endless kalpas, like gold in its hardness, like the elixir in its roundness, growing ever brighter with refinement. Buddhists say: \"○ This is true suchness.\" Confucians say: \"○ This is the Great Ultimate.\" Our Dao says: \"○ This is the Golden Elixir.\" The substance is the same; only the names differ.*\n\n*The* Book of Changes *says: \"The Changes have the Great Ultimate, which generates the Two Modes.\" The Great Ultimate is the designation for the spontaneous and formless. The Two Modes are the one yin and one yang. Yin and yang are heaven and earth. Humans are born between heaven and earth—this is called the Three Powers. The Dao of the Three Powers is fully embodied in a single person. The Great Ultimate is the original spirit; the Two Modes are body and mind. In terms of the elixir, the Great Ultimate is the mother of the elixir; the Two Modes are true lead and true mercury. What is called lead and mercury are not mercury, cinnabar, sulfur, black tin, herbs, or trees; nor are they essence, fluids, tears, saliva, heart, kidneys, qi, or blood. They are the original spirit within the body and the original qi within the body. When the body is unmoving, essence and qi congeal—this is likened to the elixir. What is called the elixir is the body. ○ is the true nature. Extracting ○ from the elixir is called \"elixir accomplished.\" The so-called elixir is not fabricated from external things; it is the fulfillment of the original source from which one is born, thereby attaining the most true. Few in the world understand this.*\n\n*Today’s practitioners of the elixir mostly fail to receive the correct transmission. They all seek externally, following the deviant and turning from the orthodox. Thus, many study but few succeed. Some refine the five metals and eight stones; some refine the three evils and five falsities; some refine the qi beyond clouds and mist; some refine the essences of the sun and moon; some gather the light of the stars; some imagine a pellet in the void to form the elixir; some imagine an object in the cinnabar field as the elixir; some fly the golden essence from behind the elbow; some visualize between the eyebrows; some return essence to replenish the brain; some circulate qi to the navel; some ingest filth and swallow essence; some inhale the new and exhale the old; some practice the Eight Brocades or the Six-Character Qi; some shake the spine; some twist the windlass; some close the tailbone; some guard the navel stem; some gather heavenly water; some refine autumn stone; some bend and stretch in daoyin; some stroke and massage to regulate; some silently pay homage to the Supreme Emperor; some press the tongue to the upper palate; some return the three fields; some close the breath and circulate qi; some gather the three fires in the bladder; some drill the five phases in the sea of bitterness. Such minor methods number in the thousands. Even with diligent practice and gathering, they will never accomplish the great task.*\n\n*The scripture says: \"The true Dharma is hard to encounter, and many go astray; the true Dao often enters deviant sects.\" This is what it means. The essentials of the most true are the simplest and easiest—difficult to encounter but easy to accomplish. If one meets a perfected person’s guidance, none fail to succeed.*\n\nDing’an said: *Your disciple, by good fortune from past lives, has met you, Master, and is blessed to receive your nurturing grace. I pray you bestow the essentials of the Golden Elixir and grant me your guidance.*\n\nThe Master said: Listen carefully now, and I shall speak to you of these matters. Those who refine the Golden Elixir must wholly seize the creative transformations of Heaven and Earth. They take Qian and Kun as their crucible and vessel, the sun and moon, water and fire, yin and yang as the mechanism of transformation, the hare and the toad as the medicine. Relying on the turning of the Celestial Stem and the revolving of the Dipper’s handle, they gather the medicine at the proper time and move the tally accordingly. Advancing fire and retreating tally follow the seasons of a year; drawing forth lead and adding mercury mirror the waxing and waning of a month. They gather the Five Phases, unite the Four Images, pursue the Two Qi to return them to the Yellow Path, and assemble the Three Essences in the Primordial Palace. Returning to the root and restoring life, when merit is complete and spirit perfected, the mortal sheds its form to become an immortal—this is called the completion of the Elixir.\n\nDing’an said: The creative transformations of Heaven and Earth truly seem difficult to seize.\n\nThe Master said: There is nothing beyond this single body—what difficulty could there be? Heaven and Earth are the bodily form; water and fire are the essence and qi; yin and yang are the body and mind; the hare and toad are the nature and emotions. Thus, the bodily form serves as the crucible and furnace, essence and qi as water and fire, emotions and nature as the mechanism of transformation, and body and mind as the medicinal materials. Fearing that students would have no standard to follow, the sages used Heaven and Earth as analogies. The body and the creative transformations of Heaven and Earth are never separate—these two words, body and mind, are both the medicine and the fire. Thus, the celestial hun and terrestrial po, the Qian horse and Kun ox, the yang lead and yin mercury, the Kan man and Li woman, the sun crow and moon hare—none lie beyond these two words, body and mind.\n\nThe turning of the Celestial Stem is the Celestial Heart. The scripture says: \"Observe the Dao with the heart, and the Dao is the heart; observe the heart with the Dao, and the heart is the Dao.\" The revolving of the Dipper’s handle is the Mysterious Pass. The Mysterious Pass is the most profound and wondrous mechanism. Yet today’s students cling to physical forms: some say it is between the eyebrows, others the navel, still others the space between the two kidneys, or behind the navel and before the kidneys, or the bladder, or the Cinnabar Field. Some say the head has nine palaces, with the Mysterious Pass at the center; others point to the birth gate as the place of bodily origin, or the mouth and nose as the Mysterious Female—all are mistaken. To fixate on physical form is entirely wrong. Yet one cannot abandon this body to seek it elsewhere. Why do none of the various elixir scriptures specify its location? It is difficult to describe in words or brushstrokes, hence it is called the Mysterious Pass. Thus, the sages inscribed only a single character, \"center,\" to show that this character is the Mysterious Pass. Clearly, this \"center\" is not the middle between inside and outside, nor the midpoint between top and bottom, nor the center within a center.\n\nThe Buddhists say: \"Neither think of good nor think of evil; at just such a time, what is one’s original face?\" This is the center of the Chan school. The Confucians say: \"Before joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure are aroused, it is called the center\"—this is the center of the Ru school. The Daoists say: \"Where thoughts do not arise is called the center\"—this is the center of the Daoist school. These are the centers employed by the Three Teachings.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* says: \"Still and unmoving, this is the substance of the center; moved and thus penetrating, this is the function of the center.\" Laozi said: \"Attain utmost emptiness, guard steadfast stillness; the myriad things arise together, and I thereby observe their return.\" The *Book of Changes* says: \"Return is how the heart of Heaven and Earth is seen.\" Now, in the *Return* hexagram, one yang is born beneath five yins. Yin is stillness; yang is movement. When stillness reaches its extreme, movement is born. This very point of movement is the Mysterious Pass. Simply apply effort at the moment of thought’s arising in the twelve double-hours, and the Mysterious Pass will naturally appear. Once the Mysterious Pass is seen, the medicine, fire times, operations, drawing forth and adding—even the transformation of the embryo and the shedding of the mortal form—all proceed from this single aperture.\n\nTo gather the medicine is to gather the true lead and true mercury within the body. The medicine arises at a specific time—not at the winter solstice, not at the moon’s birth, not at the zi hour. The patriarchs said: \"To refine the Elixir, one need not seek the winter solstice; within the body, a yang is spontaneously born.\" They also said: \"When lead sees gui arising, swiftly gather it; when gold meets the full moon, it is no longer fit to taste.\" Thus, when gui arises and a yang is born within the body, one may begin to gather it. After the Two Qi unite, one must recognize how to maintain fullness and not overdo it—when the moon is full, it is no longer fit to taste.\n\nAdvancing fire and retreating tally lack a standard, so the sages used the seasons of a year—the coming and going of cold and heat—as the model for fire and tally. They also used the waxing and waning of a month to illustrate the principles of drawing forth and adding. For example, at the winter solstice, one yang is born—the *Return* hexagram, the twelfth month. Two yangs form the *Approach* hexagram, the first month; three yangs the *Peace* hexagram, the second month; four yangs the *Great Strength* hexagram, the third month; five yangs the *Decisiveness* hexagram, the fourth month. Pure yang is the *Qian* hexagram, where yang reaches its extreme and yin is born—the fifth month. One yin forms the *Encounter* hexagram, the sixth month; two yins the *Following* hexagram, the seventh month; three yins the *Stagnation* hexagram, the eighth month; four yins the *Observation* hexagram, the ninth month; five yins the *Splitting Apart* hexagram, the tenth month. Pure yin is the *Kun* hexagram, where yin reaches its extreme and yang is born—cycling back to the beginning. This is the mechanism of advancing and retreating fire and tally.\n\nYet students cling to words and adhere to images, beginning to advance fire on the winter solstice, retreating tally on the summer solstice, and bathing in the second and eighth months—utterly unaware of the essentials. Seeing that students misdirect their efforts, the sages condensed the seasons of a year into a single month: the new and full moons represent the winter and summer solstices, the two quarters represent the second and eighth months, two and a half days represent a month, and thirty days represent a year. Yet people still fixate on the moon. The sages further condensed the waxing and waning of a month into a single day: zi and wu represent the new and full moons, mao and you represent the two quarters. Students then fixate on the day.\n\nA recent perfected master said: \"Within a single moment of effort, the seasons of a year are contained.\"\n\nIt further states: Before father and mother gave birth, where were the years, months, days, and hours? This is how the sages guide beginners to avoid misdirecting their efforts. Yet stubborn disciples, failing to fathom the principle, cling to forms and symbols, exhausting their minds in vain. I now point directly to you: the arising of *gui* within the body is the first yang; yang ascending and yin descending is the three yangs. When yin and yang divide, it is the four yangs—embodying the second month, like the waxing crescent, corresponding to *mao* hour, where one should bathe before advancing fire. When yin and yang unite and spirit and qi merge, it is the six yangs. After yin and yang intermingle and spirit and qi fuse, one must recognize the need to hold fullness, knowing when to stop lest all prior effort be wasted. Thus it is said: \"Gold at its zenith is too distant to taste.\" Then one retreats the tally, embodying the first yin, until yin and yang divide again, symbolizing the three yins—this is the time for bathing, like the eighth month, corresponding to the waning crescent, as in *you* hour. Then, retreating to the six yins, at the extreme of yin, yang is born—within a single moment, a full celestial cycle is completed. Simply follow this practice, and over time, effort gradually congeals and coalesces; the formless generates form, and the sacred embryo is forged—this is called the completion of the elixir.\n\nDing’an asked: \"The initial effort and the celestial cycle’s operation have already been revealed, yet the myriad alternate names remain beyond my grasp. I hope the master will point them out.\"\nThe master replied: \"Alternate names are merely metaphors, all deriving from the two words *body* and *mind*. At the outset of practice, gather the ear’s resonance, contain the eye’s light, seal the tongue’s breath, regulate the nose’s breathing—so the four great elements remain unmoving. Let essence, spirit, ethereal soul, corporeal soul, and intent each settle in their place: this is called the *five qi converging at the origin*. Directing them into the central palace is called *gathering the five phases*. When the mind is still, the dragon hums; when the body is still, the tiger roars; when body and mind are both still, this is called *subduing the dragon and taming the tiger*. The dragon’s hum secures qi; the tiger’s roar secures essence—grasping firmly the numinous root. Essence and qi are likened to the tortoise and snake; body and mind to the dragon and tiger. When dragon-tiger and tortoise-snake merge into one, it is called *harmonizing the four images*. Governing emotion with nature is called *metal and wood in union*. Directing qi with essence is called *water and fire in communion*. Wood and fire share a source, two natures forming one family—east’s three and south’s two together make five. Water and metal share a source, two natures forming one family—north’s one and west’s four are jointly held. Earth dwells in the central palace, belonging to intent; the five numbers of *wu* and *ji* return to the generative number five. When body, mind, and intent merge into one, the three families meet to form the infant—this is called *the three and five in fusion*. Refining essence into qi, refining qi into spirit, refining spirit into emptiness—this is called *the three flowers gathering in the tripod*, or *the three passes*. Today’s practitioners often designate the coccyx, the spine’s midpoint, and the jade pillow as the three passes, but these are merely methods, not the essentials. Where the mind stirs with thought is the *mysterious female*; those who point to the mouth and nose are mistaken. Body, mind, and intent are the three essentials. The nature within the mind is called *mercury within cinnabar*; the qi within the body is called *metal within water*. Metal inherently generates water, being water’s mother, yet metal resides within water—thus it is said: *the mother conceals the child’s embryo*. Do not let external realms enter, nor internal realms depart: this is called *sealing and securing*. Motionless stillness is called *nurturing the fire*. Spontaneous emptiness is called *operation*. Sincerity and unwavering resolve are called *guarding the city*. Subduing inner demons is called *field combat*. True mercury is called the *radiant maiden*; true lead is called the *infant*. The embryonic intent is called the *yellow woman*. Nature and emotion are called *husband and wife*. Calming the mind and settling intent, with nature still and spirit numinous, the two substances form a mass, the three origins converge—this is called *forming the embryo*. Cherishing the numinous root is called *warm nurturing*. Warm nurturing is like a dragon tending its pearl, like a hen brooding her eggs—guard it diligently, lest even a hair’s deviation ruin all prior effort. When the yang spirit emerges from the husk, it is called *shedding the embryo*. Returning to the root and restoring life is called *transcending and liberation*. Shattering emptiness is called *fulfillment*.\n\nDing’an asked: \"When the golden elixir is formed, can it still be seen?\"\nThe master replied: \"It can.\"\nDing’an asked: \"Does it have form?\"\nThe master replied: \"It has no form.\"\nDing’an asked: \"If it has no form, how can it be seen?\"\nThe master replied: \"The golden elixir is but a forced name—how could it have form? What is called *visible* cannot be seen with the eyes.\"\nA Buddhist text says: \"Within non-seeing, one intimately sees; within intimate seeing, one does not see.\"\nThe *Daoist Scripture* states: \"Looked for but not seen, listened for but not heard—this is called the Dao. Looked for but not seen, yet never not seen; listened for but not heard, yet never not heard.\" What is called *visible and audible* is not within the reach of ears and eyes—only the mind sees, only intent hears. For example, when a great wind rises, entering mountains it shakes trees, entering water it stirs waves—how can one say it does not exist? Yet when observed, it cannot be seen; when grasped, it cannot be held—how can one say it exists? The essence of the golden elixir is likewise. Thus, at the outset of elixir refinement, being and non-being mutually employ each other, movement and stillness depend on one another, until success is achieved. All conditions suddenly cease, all dharmas become empty; movement and stillness are both forgotten, being and non-being are both transcended—only then does the mysterious pearl take form, and the Great One return to truth. With nature and life both complete, form and spirit both wondrous, one emerges from being and enters non-being, roaming freely beyond the clouds—truly attaining the golden immortal. Therefore, the classics and elixir texts employ myriad alternate names to guide practitioners, leading them from the coarse to the subtle, gradually entering the wondrous realm. Yet upon seeing nature and awakening to emptiness, the matter no longer lies on paper. It is like a boat crossing the river, ferrying the people—once the far shore is reached, the boat is no longer needed.\"\n\nThe former worthies said: \"Having caught the hare, forget the snare; having caught the fish, forget the trap\"—this is precisely what is meant. Now, as I speak these words to you, do not cling to the language itself. Simply chew them thoroughly and savor them deeply, for they have yet to exhaust the source. If, upon hearing a single phrase, the ground of your mind opens and you directly enter the realm of non-doing, this is not difficult. There are yet higher mechanisms that cannot be lightly described; they must be sought beyond words.\n\n*Questions on the Golden Elixir*\nI have observed that later commentaries on the elixir classics and philosophical texts vary in their interpretations. Some fixate on the physical form, others on written words; some take purity as bitter emptiness, others regard mercury and lead as having tangible form. With such differing views, how can later generations avoid confusion? Yet the supreme Dao is one—how could there be two?\n\nMoreover, many recent elixir texts compile only side doors. For instance, explaining the seven returns and nine reversions through the cyclical positions of *yin* and *zi*, or *kun* and *shen*—is this not erroneous? I have now gathered the essentials of elixir texts into *Thirty-Six Questions*, to dispel the confusion of later practitioners. Those who understand may savor them.\n\n**Question:** What is the nine reversion?\n**Answer:** Nine is the completion number of metal. Reversion means returning to the origin—this is simply using nature to govern emotion. Emotion belongs to metal; when emotion returns to nature, it is called the nine reversion. The elixir texts say: \"When metal returns to nature at first, it may be called the reverted elixir.\" This is what is meant. To take the progression from *zi* to *shen* as the nine reversion is incorrect.\n\n**Question:** What is the seven return?\n**Answer:** Seven is the completion number of fire. Return means returning to the root—this is simply refining spirit to return to emptiness. Spirit belongs to fire; refining spirit to return to emptiness is called the seven return. To take the progression from *yin* to *shen* as the seven return is incorrect. *The Awakening to Reality* says: \"Do not rely on the *yin*-*zi* or *kun*-*shen* cycles; only the standard of the five phases matters.\" This is precisely the point.\n\n**Question:** What are the three passes?\n**Answer:** They are the mechanisms of the three origins. Refining essence into qi is the first pass; refining qi into spirit is the middle pass; refining spirit to return to emptiness is the upper pass. To point to the coccyx, spine, and jade pillow as the three passes is merely a working method, not the essential teaching. The essentials of attaining truth lie in the three passes—how could they have fixed locations? They reside in the oral instructions.\n\n**Question:** What is the mysterious pass?\n**Answer:** It is the most mysterious and wondrous mechanism. It has no fixed location. Today, many point to the navel wheel, the crown of the head, the glabella, the space between the kidneys, or the area between the kidneys and navel—all these are side doors. The elixir texts say: \"The mysterious pass is an aperture not in the four directions, above or below, inside or outside, nor to the side, nor even in the center—it is where the four great elements and five phases do not adhere.\"\n\n**Question:** What are the three palaces?\n**Answer:** They are the palaces where the three origins reside. Spirit dwells in the *qian* palace, qi in the central palace, and essence in the *kun* palace. To point to the three fields is incorrect.\n\n**Question:** What are the three essentials?\n**Answer:** The aperture of returning to the root, the pass of reviving life, and the valley of emptiness—these are the three essentials. To point to the mouth and nose as the three essentials is incorrect.\n\n**Question:** What is the mysterious female?\n**Answer:** \"The valley spirit does not die—this is called the mysterious female.\" To point to the mouth and nose is incorrect. The Perfected One of Purple Yang said: \"Where the thought arises is the mysterious female.\" This is correct. I say: where the thought arises is the root of life and death—how could it not be the mysterious female? Though this, too, is a working method. The supreme vehicle lies in the oral instructions.\n\n**Question:** What is the true seed?\n**Answer:** Before heaven and earth divided, that single point of numinous clarity—this is it. Some say humans arise from a single qi and take qi as the true seed. Others say the body arises from thought and take thought as the true seed. Still others say the body arises from the essence of the two and five, taking essence as the true seed. These three explanations seem correct but are not. The Buddha said: \"The root of birth and death through countless kalpas—fools call it the original true.\" This is what is meant.\n\n**Question:** What is the tripod and furnace?\n**Answer:** Body and mind are the tripod and furnace. The elixir texts say: \"First take *qian* and *kun* as the tripod vessel, then gather the sun and moon as medicine to refine.\" *Qian* is the mind, *kun* is the body. Those who set up furnaces and tripods externally are mistaken.\n\n**Question:** What are the medicinal substances?\n**Answer:** True lead and true mercury are the medicinal substances—these are simply the original two things.\n\n**Question:** What are the inner and outer medicines?\n**Answer:** Refining essence, refining qi, refining spirit—their substance is one, but their functions differ. The essence of intercourse, the qi of breathing, and the spirit of thought—these are the outer medicines. The primordial supreme essence, the empty and void qi, and the indestructible original spirit—these are the inner medicines. The elixir texts say: \"The twofold function of inner and outer\"—this is what is meant.\n\n**Question:** What does \"knocking bamboo to summon the turtle and swallow the jade mushroom\" mean?\n**Answer:** Knocking bamboo means regulating the breath. Summoning the turtle means gathering essence. Refining essence into qi, using qi to gather essence, essence and qi blending and fusing to form the jade mushroom—gathering and swallowing it preserves life.\n\n**Question:** What does \"strumming the zither to summon the phoenix and drink the knife-powder\" mean?\n**Answer:** Strumming the zither means emptying the mind. Summoning the phoenix means nurturing spirit. Emptying the mind and nurturing spirit, the mind becomes clear and spirit transforms—earth of the two [spleen and stomach] forms the powder. Gathering and drinking it perfects the nature.\n\n**Question:** What is the five qi returning to the origin?\n**Answer:** When the body does not move, essence is firm—water returns to the origin. When the mind does not move, qi is firm—fire returns to the origin. When nature is quiescent, the hun-spirit is stored—wood returns to the origin. When emotion is forgotten, the po-spirit is subdued—metal returns to the origin.\n\nWhen the four great elements are harmonious, intention settles—earth returns to the origin. This is called the five qi returning to the origin.\n\n**Question:** What is the Yellow Dame?\n**Answer:** Yellow is the color of the center. Dame is the title of the mother. All things are born of earth, and earth is the mother of all things, thus she is called the Yellow Dame. The fetal intention in humans is this. Some say the spleen spirit is the Yellow Dame, but this is incorrect.\n\n**Question:** What is the Metal Duke?\n**Answer:** In principle, the yang within Qian enters Kun to form Kan. Kan is water, and metal is the father of water, thus it is called the Metal Duke. In symbolic terms, the character for \"duke\" (公) is added to the edge of \"metal\" (金), signifying lead.\n\n**Question:** Kan is the Great Yin—how then is it likened to an infant?\n**Answer:** Kan is originally the body of Kun, thus it is called the Great Yin. Having received the yang of Qian, it becomes Shaoyang, and so it is likened to an infant—carrying yin while embracing yang.\n\n**Question:** Li is the Great Yang—why then is it likened to the maiden?\n**Answer:** Li is originally the body of Qian, thus it is called the Great Yang. Having received the yin of Kun, it becomes Shaoyin, and so it is likened to the maiden—yang enfolding yin within.\n\n**Question:** What is true gold?\n**Answer:** Gold is the original spirit, imperishable through kalpas, growing ever brighter with refinement—thus it is called true gold.\n\n**Question:** What is meant by mother and child?\n**Answer:** It is metal within water. Metal is the mother of water, and metal is concealed within water—thus the mother hides within the child’s womb. Likewise, spirit is the mother of the body, and spirit is concealed within the body, likened to the mother hiding within the child’s womb.\n\n**Question:** What is meant by guest and host?\n**Answer:** Nature is the master of the body, while the body is the guest. Now, borrowing this body to nurture this nature, we let the body serve as the host. As the alchemical texts say: *\"Let him be the host while I remain the guest.\"*\n\n**Question:** What is the primordial qi?\n**Answer:** Before heaven and earth were divided, there was only a single numinous essence—this is the true yang within the body. As it precedes the covering and bearing of heaven and earth, it is called the primordial.\n\n**Question:** What are water and fire?\n**Answer:** Heaven takes the sun and moon as water and fire; the *Yi* takes Kan and Li as water and fire; Chan takes samadhi and wisdom as water and fire; the sages take clarity and moisture as water and fire; medicine takes the heart and kidneys as water and fire; the Dao of alchemy takes essence and qi as water and fire. I now clearly point out: within one’s own body, all that flames above is fire, and all that moistens below is water. Though the names vary, they are but metaphors to guide the learner toward self-realization.\n\n**Question:** How is there water within fire?\n**Answer:** From of old, divine water flows from the high plateau. In principle, water cannot moisten itself—it relies on fire’s steaming to become moist. In symbolic terms, fire flourishes at *wu*, while water receives its qi at *wu*. Thus, it is clear that water exists within fire. In the body, this is the fluid within qi.\n\n**Question:** How is there fire within water?\n**Answer:** In principle, the sun emerges from the sea. In symbolic terms, water flourishes at *zi*, while fire gestates within *zi*. In the body, this is the qi within essence.\n\n**Question:** What is the completed crossing?\n**Answer:** Water ascending and fire descending is called the completed crossing. The *Yi* says: *\"Mountain below marsh—diminishing. The noble one uses this to restrain anger and suppress desire.\"* This is the method of the completed crossing: restraining anger causes fire to descend, and suppressing desire causes water to ascend.\n\n**Question:** What is the uncompleted crossing?\n**Answer:** Failing to restrain anger, fire blazes upward; failing to suppress desire, water sinks and dampens. The fire of ignorance rages, waves surge in the sea of suffering, and water and fire do not merge—this is called the uncompleted crossing.\n\n**Question:** What is the merging of metal and wood?\n**Answer:** When emotion returns to nature, it is called their merging. Emotion belongs to metal, and nature belongs to wood.\n\n**Question:** What is separation?\n**Answer:** When emotion pursues objects and nature follows thoughts, emotion and nature diverge—this is called separation.\n\n**Question:** What are clarity and turbidity?\n**Answer:** When the mind does not move, water returns to its source—thus it is clear. When the mind moves, water follows the current—thus it is turbid.\n\n**Question:** What are the two eights?\n**Answer:** It is the measure of one *jin*. Half a *jin* of lead, eight *liang* of mercury—though there are no true weights, the two must be balanced. Thus it is called the two eights. The alchemical texts say: *\"After the first quarter and before the last quarter, the medicine is level and the fire force complete.\"* This compares the balance of yin and yang. It is also like the second and eighth months, when day and night are equal.\n\n**Question:** What is bathing?\n**Answer:** Washing the mind and cleansing thoughts is called bathing.\n\n**Question:** What is the completion of the elixir?\n**Answer:** When body and mind unite, spirit and qi merge, and emotion and nature become one—this is called the completion of the elixir, likened to the sacred embryo. As the immortal master said: *\"When true nature arrives, it is the golden elixir—refining the four illusions into a single pellet.\"*\n\n**Question:** What is nurturing the fire?\n\nAnswer: To extinguish all thoughts is nurturing the fire.\n\n**Question:** What is shedding the embryo?\n**Answer:** When there is a body beyond the body, this is called shedding the embryo.\n\n**Question:** What is ultimate completion?\n**Answer:** To become one with the Great Void is called ultimate completion.\n\nThe transformations beyond phenomena are not easily described in passing—it depends on one’s own realization.\n\n**The Living Method of Quanzhen**\nTransmitted to Disciples\n\nA Quanzhen Daoist should practice the Way of Quanzhen. What is called *Quanzhen*? It means preserving one’s original truth. Only when essence, qi, and spirit are all whole is it called *Quanzhen*. Any deficiency renders it incomplete; any stain renders it impure.\n\nPreserving essence can protect the body. To preserve essence, first stabilize the body—stability eliminates desire, and thus essence is whole.\n\nPreserving qi can nourish the mind. To preserve qi, first purify the mind—purity eliminates thoughts, and thus qi is whole.\n\nPreserving spirit can return to emptiness. To preserve spirit, first make the intention sincere—sincerity unites body and mind, returning to emptiness.\n\nThus, essence, qi, and spirit are the three primordial medicines; body, mind, and intention are the three primordial essentials. In learning the immortal’s method, one need not do much—simply refine the three treasures of essence, qi, and spirit as the foundation of the elixir. When the three treasures gather in the Central Palace, the golden elixir is complete. Is this not easy to know? Is it difficult to practice? What is difficult to know or practice arises only from delusion and confusion.\n\nThe essentials of refining essence lie in the body. When the body is still, the tiger roars and wind arises, the dark turtle lies hidden, and primordial essence congeals.\n\nThe essentials of refining qi lie in the mind. When the mind is still, the dragon chants and clouds gather, the vermilion bird folds its wings, and primordial qi rests.\n\nThe essentials of generating spirit lie in intention. When intention is still, the two substances merge, the three primordials unite as one, and the sacred embryo forms.\n\nThe cauldron of Qian and Kun, the medicines of Kan and Li, the three primordials of the Eight Trigrams, the five phases and four images—none transcend the three words *body, mind, intention*. The ultimate attainment of *Quanzhen* lies in nothing beyond the two words *body and mind*. To depart from body and mind is to follow an external path. Yet one must not cling to body and mind either—any attachment to them becomes a burden. One must use them without being bound by them.\n\nWhat I call *body and mind* are not the illusory physical body and fleshly heart, but the invisible body and mind. How to describe the invisible body and mind? *\"Clouds rise from the mountain, the moon enters the heart of the waves.\"* The body is the pure body since time immemorial, the wondrous existence within non-being. The mind is the numinous origin before the Emperor of Form, the true non-being within being. Non-being containing being resembles Kan; being containing non-being resembles Li. The ancestral master said: *\"Take the solid center of the Kan position, and transmute the yin within the Li palace. From this, it transforms into the vigorous body of Qian—hidden or soaring, all depends on the mind.\"*\n\nI say that the two words *body and mind* are the ultimate attainment of *Quanzhen*—what doubt remains?\n\nThe essentials of elixir refinement lie solely in *nature and life*. To depart from nature and life is to enter side doors, clinging to one side and calling it *partial withering*. The ancestral master said: *\"Spirit is nature, qi is life.\"* This is the meaning.\n\nRefining qi lies in protecting the body; refining spirit lies in protecting the heart. When the body is still, the tiger roars; when the mind is still, the dragon chants. The tiger’s roar sends lead into mercury; the dragon’s chant sends mercury into lead. Lead and mercury are alternate names for Kan and Li. The yang within Kan is the supreme essence within the body; the yin within Li is the primordial qi within the mind.\n\nRefining essence into qi begins with protecting the body; refining qi into spirit begins with protecting the heart. When the body is stable, form is firm—form firm, life is complete. When the mind is stable, spirit is whole—spirit whole, nature is complete. Body and mind unite, nature and life are whole, form and spirit are wondrous—this is called the completion of the elixir.\n\nRefining essence into qi and qi into spirit is not yet extraordinary—why? Because there remains the subtlety of refining spirit, which is not easily spoken of lightly. What I have previously outlined of the great outline of the golden elixir—if you have the eye to see here, you will know the great matter does not lie on paper. If not, you must first know where to begin. Once you know where to begin, proceed from there. Start by refining essence; when essence abides, then refine qi; when qi stabilizes, then refine spirit; when spirit congeals, then return to emptiness. Empty it again and again, and virtue and Dao are complete.\n\nRefining essence depends on knowing the *moment*. What is called *moment* is not the time of the clock. To fixate on time is to miss it. If one says there is no moment, how does one begin? What, after all, is to be done? Ah! The ancients said: *\"When the moment arrives, the spirit knows.\"* The ancestral master said: *\"When lead sees the birth of gui, hasten to gather it.\"* These words say it all.\n\nRefining qi depends on *harmonizing and blending*. What is called *harmonizing and blending* is harmonizing the true breath and regulating the true origin. Laozi said: *\"The gate of the mysterious female is called the root of heaven and earth. Subtle and continuous, its use is inexhaustible.\"* Is this not the essential of harmonizing and blending? Today, people point to the mouth and nose as the gate of the mysterious female—this is incorrect. The mysterious female is the mechanism of heaven and earth’s opening and closing. The *Book of Changes* says: *\"Closing the door is called Kun; opening the door is called Qian. Opening and closing are called change.\"* Opening and closing are movement and stillness. This is the meaning of Laozi’s *\"its use is inexhaustible.\"*\n\nThe alchemical texts say: *\"Exhale to connect with the root of heaven; inhale to connect with the root of earth. Exhale, and the dragon chants as clouds rise; inhale, and the tiger roars as wind stirs.\"* I say: *\"Exhale to connect with the root of heaven; inhale to connect with the root of earth\"* is *\"closing the door is called Kun; opening the door is called Qian.\"* *\"Exhale, and the dragon chants as clouds rise; inhale, and the tiger roars as wind stirs\"* is *\"opening and closing are called change\"*—this is also the meaning of *\"its use is inexhaustible.\"*\n\nThe mouth and nose as the Mysterious Female—is this not an error? What is called \"breathing\" here is the true *qi* that comes and goes without end. The oral instruction: The external yin and yang in their alternation are the external medicine. The internal interpenetration of Kan and Li is the internal medicine. The external has its operations; the internal is spontaneous. The use of essence, *qi*, and spirit has two aspects, yet their substance is one.\n\nRegarding the external medicine: in the essence of sexual union, the first requirement is non-leakage; in the *qi* of exhalation and inhalation, it must be ever more refined. As for the spirit of thought and reflection, tranquility is paramount.\n\nRegarding the internal medicine: Refining essence refines primordial essence—this is drawing forth the primordial yang from Kan. When primordial essence is firm, the essence of sexual union will naturally not leak. Refining *qi* refines primordial *qi*—this is replenishing the primordial yin within Li. When primordial *qi* abides, the *qi* of exhalation and inhalation will naturally not move in and out. Refining spirit refines primordial spirit—this is Kan and Li uniting in the body to form Qian. When primordial spirit congeals, the spirit of thought and reflection attains perfect stability.\n\nAbove this, there is yet the refinement of emptiness, a matter not easily spoken of lightly—its value lies in silent comprehension and heart-mind resonance. Strive on, strive on.\n\n*End of Zhonghe ji, Scroll Three*\n*Beginning of Zhonghe ji, Scroll Four*\n\n**On Nature and Life**\nBy Li Daochun Yuanfu of Dulian Qing’an Jingchanzi\nCompiled by Disciple Sun’an Baochanzi Cai Zhiyi\n\nWhat is *xing* (nature)? It is the primordial, supremely numinous, singular spirit. What is *ming* (life)? It is the primordial, supremely refined, singular *qi*. Essence and *xing* are the root of *ming*. The transformations of *xing* depend on the heart-mind; the transformations of *ming* depend on the body. Discernment and wisdom arise from the heart-mind; thoughts and reflections are the heart-mind’s servitude of *xing*. Actions and responses arise from the body; speech and silence, seeing and hearing are the body’s burdens upon *ming*. When *ming* bears the body’s burdens, there is birth and death. When *xing* is subjected to the heart-mind’s servitude, there is coming and going. Know then that \"body\" and \"heart-mind\" are the abode of spirit and essence, while spirit and essence are the root of *xing* and *ming*. *Xing* cannot stand without *ming*; *ming* cannot exist without *xing*. Though their names are two, their principle is one.\n\nAlas! Today’s learners, black-robed monks, and Daoist adepts divide *xing* and *ming* into two, each clinging to one side, mutually disputing right and wrong. They do not realize that solitary yin or orphaned yang cannot accomplish the great work. Those who cultivate *ming* without understanding *xing* will not escape karmic fate; those who perceive *xing* without knowing *ming*—where will they ultimately return? The Immortal Master said: \"To refine the Golden Elixir without fathoming *xing* is the foremost malady in cultivation. To refine only the true *xing* without refining the Elixir—even after ten thousand kalpas, the radiant spirit will not attain sagehood.\" Truly, these are weighty words.\n\nThe loftiest adepts comprehend both *xing* and *ming*: first upholding the precepts, concentration, and wisdom to empty the heart-mind; then refining essence, *qi*, and spirit to preserve the body. When the body is at peace, the foundation of *ming* is eternally firm; when the heart-mind is emptied and clarified, the root of *xing* is perfectly luminous. When *xing* is luminous, there is neither coming nor going; when *ming* is firm, there is neither death nor birth. As for merging into perfect wholeness, directly entering non-action—*xing* and *ming* are both complete, form and spirit both wondrous.\n\nYet one must not assert that *xing* and *ming* are originally two, nor treat them as a single matter. They are fundamentally one, but in application, they are two. If one clings to partiality and enters through a single gate, this is a failure to understand *xing* and *ming*. Failing to understand *xing* and *ming* is to sunder them into two. If *xing* and *ming* do not mutually sustain each other, how can one ascend to truth and tread the celestial realms?\n\n**On the Symbolism of Hexagrams**\nThe Perfected One Haiqiong said: \"The highest-grade elixir method requires no hexagrams or lines.\" Why then do all elixir texts employ hexagrams and lines? This is the Sage’s pedagogical device to reveal the Dao. As the ancients said: \"The Great Dao is wordless; without words, its Dao cannot be revealed.\" This is the meaning.\n\nThe term \"hexagram\" (*gua*) means \"to hang.\" Like hanging an object in empty space to display it to others, or as heaven suspends images to show fortune and misfortune, making them easily visible. \"Image\" (*xiang*) means \"to resemble this\"; \"line\" (*yao*) means \"to emulate this.\" A hexagram of three lines symbolizes the Three Powers—these are one’s Three Origins. A hexagram of six lines symbolizes the Six Voids—these are one’s Six Harmonies. Elixir texts use hexagrams and lines to guide practitioners in modeling the furnace, following the lines to advance the fire, and easily establishing standards.\n\nWhen the Perfected One Haiqiong spoke of \"no hexagrams or lines,\" he was warning later generations not to become fixated on line symbols—using them while transcending them. For example, before this body was born, it was quiescent and unmoving, like the ode to the undivided Supreme Ultimate. With the arising of this body, *xing* and *ming* are established—this is the Supreme Ultimate generating the Two Modes. With form comes *xing* and temperament—this is the Two Modes generating the Four Images. As for spirit, *hun*, *po*, intention, *qi*, body, and heart-mind—all are fully possessed—this is the Four Images generating the Eight Trigrams.\n\nThe ancients said: \"If names are not released, then in the Palace of Li, cultivate concentration; returning to the Dao, seek the mysterious in the Water Mansion.\" This refers to the essentials of refining *xing* and *ming*. \"Cultivating concentration in the Palace of Li\" means upholding precepts, concentration, and wisdom, so that all dust does not adhere and the myriad things are empty—this is removing the yin within Li. \"Seeking the mysterious in the Water Mansion\" means refining essence, *qi*, and spirit, so that the Three Flowers gather in the tripod, the Five *Qi* return to the origin, and the yang within Kan is preserved.\n\nThe profoundly enlightened adept holds both principles together: embracing yin while carrying yang, emptying the heart-mind and filling the abdomen—this is extracting the yang within Kan to replenish the yin within Li, thereby re-forming the Qian body. The Perfected One Ziyang said:\n*\"Take the solid center from Kan’s position,\nTo transmute the yin within Li’s palace.\nFrom this, transform into Qian’s vigorous body—\nConcealment and soaring are all at the heart’s command.\"*\nThis is precisely the meaning.\n\nIn employing hexagrams and lines for fire phases, the two hexagrams Qian and Kun—vigorous and yielding—mutually interact, advancing and retreating to determine the four seasons and complete the year. The four virtues operate and transform without end. The progression and retreat of fire, the extraction and addition, increase and decrease—all are modeled upon them. A year is condensed into a month, a month into a day, a day into an hour, an hour into a *ke*, a *ke* into a single breath. From the vastness of cosmic eras and kalpas to the subtlety of a single breath, each has a complete cycle of movement. Those who grasp this principle have attained the essentials of advancing fire and withdrawing the tally.\n\nYet in the Dao of the Elixir, hexagrams are used for the method, and lines for the fire phases—all are metaphors. One must not cling to hexagrams and lines. Know that to cross a river, one needs a raft; upon reaching the shore, the boat is no longer needed. Having caught the fish, forget the trap; having snared the hare, forget the snare. The Perfected One Ziyang said:\n*\"Within this, grasp the meaning and cease seeking images;\nTo exhaust the lines is but to labor the emotions.\"*\nAnd again:\n*\"Without carving time to divide midnight and noon,\nWithin the hexagrams and lines, Qian and Kun are determined.\"*\nBoth refer to this.\n\nI say: those born with knowledge obtain it without seeking, hitting the mark without effort—how could they rely on inducements and metaphors? Thus, the highest-grade elixir method does not employ hexagrams or lines. For those of middling and lesser capacity who cannot directly comprehend, gradual entry is necessary.\n\nThus, all alchemical texts take hexagrams and lines as their method—those who comprehend savor them and attain realization on their own.\n\nOn life and death, the Most High said: *\"People treat death lightly because they cling so deeply to life; it is for this reason they treat death lightly.\"* And again: *\"Only those who do not prize life are wiser than those who value it.\"* This means that when one seeks life, it cannot be grasped—how then could death exist? Where there is life, there is death; without death, there is no life. Thus, in the great matter of nature and destiny, life and death are of utmost weight. To know death, one must first know life; knowing life, one naturally knows death. Zilu asked about death, and the Master said: *\"If you do not yet understand life, how can you understand death?\"* How profound the words of the Sage! The *Xici* speaks of *\"tracing beginnings to grasp endings\"*—does this not refer to the discourse on life and death?\n\nI say: those who study the Dao, if they wish to grasp the end, must first trace the beginning; if they wish to clarify the final outcome, they must thoroughly examine the present. If one is free and unburdened now, one will be free and unburdened at the end; if one is liberated now, one will be liberated at the end. From ancient times to the present, the sages of all ages who shed their mortal forms and transformed through spirit, responding to change without end—this is because they had previously refined themselves to purity, and thus at the end could ascend lightly. If there is one who, in ordinary circumstances, sees through every realm and penetrates it thoroughly, is not deluded by phenomena, and is not ensnared by conditions, then at the end no realm can delude him, and no condition can bind him.\n\nI see that those who meditate today, the moment they close their eyes, all manner of illusory and demonic visions appear before them. Once they enter these demonic realms, they become one with the yin demons, unaware of themselves. Even if some awaken, they cannot dispel them, becoming like a corpse with breath—possessing all six senses yet unable to act, tossed and disturbed without respite. If one is not free now, how can one be free at the shore of life and death? Only a resolute person, whether their eyes are open or closed, remains the same, untainted by any illusory realm, coming and going without attachment, attaining great freedom. If one is free and unburdened now, why fear not being so at the end?\n\nMaster Qing’an, not sparing his two flaps of skin, expounds for the likes of Sun’an: the work you do now is the great matter of the end; the present is the cause, the end is the effect. All thoughts and concerns now belong to the yin realm; all illusory conditions are demonic realms. If in ordinary times you can sweep them clean, at the end you will not be confused by them. Thoughts should be dispelled by principle; illusions should be severed by resolve. When thoughts cease, yin dissipates; when illusions vanish, demons perish, and yang arises. With long accumulation, yin is exhausted and yang is pure—this is called immortality. But if thoughts multiply and conditions arise, following desires and indulging them, then yin grows and demons flourish, and yang diminishes. With long accumulation, yang is exhausted and yin is pure—this is death.\n\nA great cultivator whose share of yin is not yet exhausted does not become immortal. An ordinary person whose share of yang is not yet exhausted does not die. Those who hold this view—the lofty adepts of the Mystery Gate and the assembly of Dharma—firmly resolve, maintain unwavering faith, and directly sweep clean, making themselves utterly bare and empty, allowing not even a speck of dust to cling. This is the pure Dharmakāya.\n\nIf you do not cling to any form, then no form clings to you;\nIf you do not stain yourself with any dharma, then no dharma grasps you;\nIf you do not see any thing, then no thing sees you;\nIf you do not know any affair, then no affair knows you;\nIf you do not hear any sound, then no sound hears you;\nIf you do not engage any perception, then no perception engages you.\nThe five aggregates and six consciousnesses are likewise so.\n\nWhen the six dusts do not enter, the six senses are pure; when the five aggregates are empty, the five eyes are perfectly clear. At this stage, the six senses intermingle and function as one, the whole body becomes an eye, all yin is exhausted, and the entire being is pure yang. Nature and destiny are both preserved, form and spirit are both wondrous, and one merges with the true Dao. What life and death is there to transcend? What present and end remains? Without cause, without effect, without existence, without nonexistence—how vast the lightness, how great the freedom! Ah, the wonder of the patience of the unborn Dharma is fully realized here.\n\nWritten on the fifteenth day of the first lunar month in the renchen year of the Zhiyuan era, by Qing’an Yingchanzi at Zhonghe Hermitage, for Cai Sun’an and others.\n\nOn movement and stillness, the Most High said: *\"Attain utmost emptiness, guard stillness firmly; as the myriad things arise together, I observe their return.\"* This speaks of stillness reaching its extreme and then moving. *\"The ten thousand things flourish, each returning to its root; returning to the root is called stillness—this is called restoring destiny.\"* This speaks of movement reaching its extreme and returning to stillness. And again: *\"Restoring destiny is called constancy.\"* This means that stillness moves and movement is still—this is the constancy of the Dao. If one takes movement as movement and stillness as stillness, that is the constancy of things.\n\nThe former worthies said: *\"Stillness moves, movement is still—this is spirit; movement without stillness, stillness without movement—this is matter.\"* Does this not refer to this? Thus, in preserving body and mind, nothing surpasses movement and stillness. Those who study the Dao gather body and mind, attain utmost emptiness, and guard stillness firmly—then they can observe return. The *Book of Changes* says: *\"Return—is this not the manifestation of Heaven and Earth’s heart?\"* The hexagram *Fu* (Return) arises from *Kun* (Receptive) and is stillness moving. Five yin lines are utterly still, and one yang moves below—this is called *Fu*. Is this not stillness reaching its extreme and then moving? Observing return, one knows transformation; knowing transformation, one is not transformed; not being transformed, one returns to the root.\n\nReturning to the root is called stillness—this is known as the restoration of life. Is this not movement returning to stillness?\n\nThe *Book of Changes*’ *Xici* states: *\"Closing the door is called Kun; opening the door is called Qian. The alternation of closing and opening is called change; the ceaseless coming and going is called penetration.\"* The alternation of closing and opening is the alternation of movement and stillness. Ceaseless coming and going is the unceasing of movement and stillness. Interacting movement and stillness, the mechanism endlessly operates—this is called transformation. Extending and enacting it, responding to change without end—this is called penetration.\n\nThe *Daodejing* says: *\"The valley spirit does not die—this is called the mysterious female.\"* This speaks of emptiness and numinous clarity, where the mechanism of movement and stillness cannot be concealed. It further states: *\"The gate of the mysterious female—this is called the root of Heaven and Earth.\"* This refers to Qian’s yang and Kun’s yin, the alternation of closing and opening that generates transformation. It also says: *\"Subtle and ever-present, its use is inexhaustible.\"* This is the ceaseless coming and going called penetration.\n\nThe root of Heaven opens and closes like a person’s breath. Exhaling connects to the root of Heaven—this is called opening; inhaling connects to the root of Earth—this is called closing. Exhaling, the dragon chants and clouds arise; inhaling, the tiger roars and wind stirs—this is called transformation. Wind and clouds converge, dragon and tiger intertwine, movement and stillness mutually arise—manifest and subtle are seamless—this is called penetration.\n\nWhat I call breath is not that of the mouth and nose, but the ceaseless, subtle flow of true breath. If one clings to the mouth and nose as the mysterious female, how can one fully grasp the divine dance of Heaven and Earth? Those who understand Heaven and Earth’s transformations and the workings of the spirit are called superior scholars. Those who comprehend this principle know that Qian’s Way is strong and unceasing—just as the heart moves without contrivance, ceaseless in effort. Kun’s Way is receptive and nurturing—just as the body is still and responds to things, its use inexhaustible.\n\nThe heart models Heaven and thus is clear; the body models Earth and thus is still. Abiding in clarity and stillness, the mechanism of Heaven and Earth’s opening and closing is maintained by me. The classic states: *\"Clarity is the source of turbidity; movement is the foundation of stillness. If one can abide in constant clarity and stillness, Heaven and Earth wholly return.\"* This speaks precisely of this.\n\nThe disciples of Jingxian An inquired of me about the essentials of preserving body and mind. I answered them with movement and stillness, intending that they gather body and mind and emulate the functions of Heaven and Earth. Preserving the body lies in harmonizing; preserving the heart lies in restraint. Harmonizing values movement; restraint values stillness. Movement emulates Heaven; stillness emulates Earth. When body and heart are both still, Heaven and Earth unite.\n\nAt the extreme of stillness, the true mechanism naturally and wondrously responds—this is no ordinary movement. This very mechanism of movement is the heart of Heaven. Once the heart of Heaven is revealed, the mysterious pass opens. Once the mysterious pass opens, the medicine and ingredients are here, the crucible and furnace are here, the firing times are here. The Three Origins, Eight Trigrams, Four Images, and Five Phases—all operations are fully contained within.\n\nAt this stage of practice, body and heart merge, movement and stillness mutually require each other, and the mechanism of Heaven and Earth’s opening and closing is entirely within me. When the heart returns to emptiness and quiescence, the body enters non-action, movement and stillness are both forgotten, essence congeals and qi transforms.\n\nHere, essence naturally transforms into qi, qi naturally transforms into spirit, spirit naturally transforms into emptiness, merging with the Great Void as one—this is called returning to the root and restoring the origin. Ah! The Way of longevity and enduring vision is fully realized here.\n\nWritten on the fourth day after the Lantern Festival of the renchen year of the Zhiyuan era, by Yingchanzi of Qing’an at the Zhonghe Retreat, for the disciples of Jingxian An.\n\n*Song: \"Hymn to the Original Dao\" – Gift to Yeyun*\n\nIf the mysterious stream truly penetrates the Mysterious Pass,\nTreading the luminous path to attain the Real is not difficult.\nIt is only these star-like apertures—\nYet they delude people as if separated by ten thousand mountains.\n\nThough the world may have those who seek the Golden Elixir,\nMost cling to texts and cling to things.\nThough they toil with bitter resolve within the teachings,\nThey are like foolish cats guarding empty burrows.\n\nSome take minerals as the Mother of the Elixir,\nSome say the mouth and nose are the Mysterious Female.\nSome claim the heart and kidneys are Kan and Li,\nSome say essence and blood are the wondrous pair.\n\nThey exhaust form and torment the body, wasting spirit—\nThe subtle root is fragmented, the Dao does not unfold.\nOnly when the numinous source is utterly lost\nDo they still cling, refusing to turn back.\n\nYet each person possesses the essentials of longevity,\nThe Dao’s methods are available to all—yet none resemble it.\nFloating vanities confuse the eyes—who returns the light?\nThin mists entangle the heart—who reflects inward?\n\nI observe Yeyun of Yingchuan—\nMarvelous! He has mastered both Dao and Buddha.\nJade locks and golden shackles are all cast off,\nSwiftly retreating from the torrent, he reveres the Mysterious Wind.\n\nNow that I have found a friend who knows the melody,\nI reveal all the celestial mechanisms without reserve:\nWithin the Kan Water lies a speck of gold—\nHasten to unite it with the heart of Li.\n\nA single phrase of the Dao-heart I share with you, worthy one:\nFrom now on, cease your scattered inquiries.\nFor nine summers, simply observe the dragon drawing water—\nThe bright decree of Heaven clearly reveals the true meaning.\n\nGrasp this mechanism and know how to gather the medicine:\nWhere the earth-thunder quakes, the bellows and pipes resound.\nIn an instant, clouds and rain gather in great mist,\nAll qi converges—true bliss!\n\nFrom the water, the elusive Jade Toad is obtained,\nPlaced within the suspended womb-crucible for storage.\nAdvancing fire and retreating tally—when the work is complete,\nFrom nothingness, being arises, and the Mysterious Pearl is formed.\n\nYet obtaining the Mysterious Pearl is not yet the ultimate marvel—\nRefining the spirit and nurturing it remains profoundly subtle.\nLead must run, mercury must fly,\nWater fears cold, fire fears dryness.\n\nIn tending the fire, one must know how to hold fullness;\nWhen stillness settles, the Three Primes coalesce into the Great Treasure.\nBreaking through the crown gate, the spirit sheds its husk—\nTogether we shall ascend to pay homage to the Three Pure Ones.\n\n*Song of Refining Emptiness, with Preface*\n\nThe root of the Dao is utter emptiness;\nFrom emptiness and nothingness, qi is born.\nWhen the One Qi divides, the Two Modes stand forth:\nThat which is clear and ascends is called Heaven,\nThat which is turbid and descends is called Earth.\n\nHeaven is round and moves—\nThe Northern Asterism does not shift, for it governs motion.\nEarth is square and still—\nThe Eastern Flow does not cease, for it governs stillness.\n\nThe Northern Asterism is the heart of Heaven and Earth,\nThe Eastern Flow is the qi of Heaven and Earth.\nNurture the heart with emptiness, so the heart may be still;\nNurture qi with emptiness, so qi may circulate.\n\nWhen the human heart is at peace and still,\nLike the Northern Asterism’s unshifting, the spirit is utterly empty and numinous.\nThose who attain this vision hold the Heavenly Dao within themselves.\nWhen qi constantly moves,\nLike the Eastern Flow’s unceasing, the form is firmly preserved.\nThose who attain this vision hold the Earthly Dao within themselves.\n\nWhen the Dao of Heaven and Earth is within oneself,\nForm and spirit are both wondrous,\nYin and yang cannot be altered or displaced—\nOne transcends beyond the workings of creation.\n\nThus, emptiness is the body of the Great Dao,\nThe beginning of Heaven and Earth.\nFrom it arise movement and stillness,\nThrough it yin and yang revolve,\nFrom it all things are born.\nTherefore, emptiness is the great root of all under Heaven.\n\nThe noble scholar Wang of Hangzhou named his studio after bamboo,\nFor he drew inspiration from this principle.\nIn affairs, he acted with integrity;\nIn the world, he moved with compliance;\nIn the heart, he cultivated gentleness;\nIn the body, he maintained stillness—\nThese are the moral principles of bamboo.\n\nIn action, he forgot emotion;\nIn stillness, he forgot thought;\nResponding to opportunity, he forgot the self;\nAdapting to change, he forgot things—\nThis is the inner emptiness of bamboo.\n\nHe established resolute determination,\nMaintained unwavering faith,\nHarmonized inner and outer,\nRemained unchanging from beginning to end—\nThis is the winter endurance of bamboo.\n\nHe broadly sought the company of the wise,\nVisited enlightened teachers far and wide,\nReceived wandering monks with cloud and water,\nAnd harmonized the Three Teachings—\nThis is the grove of bamboo.\n\nMoreover, he embraced simplicity and held to plainness,\nReduced selfishness and curbed desires,\nRegulated breath and cultivated sincerity,\nObserved transformations and knew renewal—\nWho but one who attains the utmost emptiness under Heaven could achieve this?\nThus, naming his studio after bamboo was most fitting.\n\nIn the xinmao year, a Quanzhen Daoist came to the Zhonghe Retreat in Jinling.\nHe spoke of profound virtue, and I deeply esteemed him.\nThereafter, he visited three times by cloud-chariot.\nObserving his words, I saw his aspiration for emptiness and tranquility.\nThus, on the Double Yang Festival of the jihai year, I soared across the void on a flying sword to visit the master.\nExamining his conduct and scrutinizing his speech,\nI saw that he had deeply penetrated the Mysterious Principle.\nTherefore, I bestowed upon him the name *Juechan* (Paired Toads).\n\nThe character *jue* consists of two jades joined together,\nEnabling the interflow of emptiness and fullness—\nThe great method for preserving form and spirit in their entirety.\nEmptiness is the body of fullness, fullness is the function of emptiness;\nWhen emptiness and fullness interflow, coming and going are unimpeded.\n\nJade also embodies the meaning of purity and whiteness:\nWithin an empty chamber, whiteness arises,\nThe spirit’s dwelling is profoundly settled,\nAnd naturally, the light of Heaven shines forth,\nIlluminating all without partiality.\nWhen the work reaches this point,\nThe tasks of immortals, buddhas, and sages are complete.\n\nHaving spoken thus, I compose this piece to record it.\nThe song goes:\n\nTo be immortal, buddha, or Confucian sage—\nThe three teachings transmit but one emptiness.\nFrom ancient times to now, all who transcend\nHave cultivated within this void.\n\nThose who study immortality take emptiness and stillness as the elixir’s core,\nThose who study Buddhism plumb the void in meditation.\nAs for me, learning the sagely way—\nIn emptiness, the self dissolves, and Heaven’s principle shines clear.\n\nThe Dao’s body is an empty vastness, wondrous and boundless,\nHeaven and Earth operate through emptiness, qi harmoniously fuses.\nYin and Yang’s transformations are driven by the void’s ebb and flow;\nIf one delves into emptiness, all becomes fluid and free.\n\nThe marvel of the returning elixir lies in the valley of nothingness—\nBegin by attaining emptiness, steadfastly guard stillness.\nPush emptiness to its extreme, and primordial qi congeals;\nStillness deepened further, yang revives in turn.\n\nAn empty heart and full belly are the Dao’s foundation,\nWhen the numinous void is not obscured, it is time to gather the medicine.\nEmptying the self to respond to the moment is true daily practice,\nOne who embodies the Great Void is a child of the heroic.\n\nGathering lead in emptiness and stillness is effortless action,\nAdvancing the fire uses emptiness as the bellows’ key.\nAll additions and subtractions arise from emptiness,\nShattering the void completes the Great Learning.\n\nUltimately, the Dao is empty yet inexhaustibly active—\nTo resolve entanglements and blunt sharpness, both must be embraced.\nKnowing the light, one blends with the world, forgetting self and others;\nBefore the image of the Lord, only the self knows.\n\nBefore the uncarved, how could there be trigrams?\nQian is not above, Kun is not below.\nAt the center, a single point of utmost emptiness and numinosity,\nEight-sided and flawless, without seam or crack.\n\nThough its four edges are firmly sealed, it pierces the undifferentiated whole—\nThis is the Mysterious Female’s gate of central emptiness.\nIf one seeks to employ emptiness without first becoming empty,\nNaturally, opening and closing will align with Heaven and Earth.\n\nWhen the Mysterious Female’s gate opens, the work reaches its peak,\nFrom this the spirit emerges, to this it returns.\nEmerging and entering, it reverts to emptiness—\nSuddenly, a spring thunderclap shakes the earth.\n\nWhen the thunderclap resounds, Heaven and Earth part,\nFrom the void bursts forth a perfect wheel of light.\nRound and full, its radiance vast,\nLacking nothing, excess nothing, it illumines all equally.\n\nThis master of the bamboo’s uprightness is extraordinary—\nGrasp it subtly to respond to all things in season.\nWithin emptiness, settle the spirit; within emptiness, act.\nIn speech, reveal the void’s subtle workings.\n\nWhen emptiness reaches its ultimate, all errors cease,\nAbiding in emptiness, Heaven and Earth return in full.\nThe hollow-hearted, straight-stemmed green bamboo—\nThis is the foremost mechanism of refining emptiness.\n\n*Song of Breaking Delusion*\n\nAlas for the gold elixir seekers of the world,\nTheir methods diverge, their cinnabar varies endlessly.\nClinging to images, mired in texts, what can they achieve?\nPlucking leaves, chasing branches—all in vain.\n\nThey gather the sun’s essence, absorb the moon’s radiance,\nContain light, ingest qi, and swallow mist.\nCrouching and stretching, they busy themselves needlessly,\nRolling their eyes, pinching their lids, conjuring empty flowers.\n\nThey refine thick saliva, swallow fluids,\nPress the tailbone, clench the spine.\nVisualizing, contemplating, gazing at the tip of the nose,\nThey churn seas and overturn oceans, consuming filth.\n\nThey guard blandness, sink into dull emptiness,\nStupefied and dazed, they rush through their practice.\nSome add massage and breath-counting—\nAll far removed from the principle of the gold elixir.\n\nEight Brocades, Six Healing Sounds,\nFasting and grain-avoidance—what do these accomplish?\nClinging to the Three Peaks, they study yin-cultivation,\nNine shallow thrusts, one deep—such is their advance and retreat.\n\nThey stir the waist, cup the kidneys, guard the Gate of Life,\nBend and stretch, guide and lead, playing with essence and spirit.\nFacing the furnace, consuming milk, mimicking military strategy—\nSuch family traditions are not worth discussing.\n\nSome practice turtle-retraction and breath-holding,\nBear-stretching and crow-flying—all futile labor.\nThe \"Rubbing Waist Layman\" warms his belly,\nThe \"Qi-Circulating Master\" reddens his face.\n\nThey strike the Heavenly Drum, embrace Kunlun,\nKnock their teeth, gather their spirit, gaze at the crown.\nHearing echoes, they mistake them for a roaring tiger,\nWhen their bellies gurgle, they claim it is the female dragon’s song.\n\nThey burn the cinnabar field, chant over boiling seas,\nSleepless day and night, enduring bitter trials.\nBarefoot and in thin clothes, they suffer torment,\nRepaying debts of hunger and cold from past lives.\n\nConstantly maintaining silence is but futile effort,\nSilently worshipping the Emperor—how can one ascend?\nExhaling into their hands, clutching their bags—true vulgar lords,\nRubbing their urine—how mad and deranged.\n\nThey wield the golden spear, draw from the golden well,\nUsing beautiful women as their medicine crucibles.\nThey gather others’ essence and blood, calling it true lead,\nLosing their primordial harmony, yet still unaware.\n\nSome spout Chan like tangled vines,\nWagging their tongues, showing off their eloquence.\nPointing to emptiness, expounding on emptiness, they brawl,\nRaising fists, thrusting fingers—ignorant of the source.\n\nThey raise \"critical phrases,\" observe methods,\nWielding quick wit and sharp repartee, clamoring over texts.\nBrandishing hammers, flourishing whisk brooms, they recruit disciples,\nBlinking their eyes, raising their brows—this is their \"transmission.\"\n\nStudying cases, pursuing Chan,\nTrue high monks would never act thus.\nMany paths to reason are called wisdom,\nBut \"seeing the nature\" must wait for the donkey’s year.\n\nDaoists, Confucians, Buddhists—abandon your clinging,\nTurn the light inward, reflect, and measure yourself.\nSuddenly, you touch the tip of your nose—\nOnly then will you realize all that came before was wrong.\n\nStudents of immortality, cease your chatter,\nTrace the breath’s origin to its root.\nDiscard all forms and seeking,\nAvoid even the formless and imageless.\n\nThe heart is not fire, the kidneys are not water,\nOrdinary essence cannot be called Heavenly Water.\nThe Yellow Dame is not in the spleen,\nThe Mysterious Female is not in the mouth or nose.\n\nMao is not the rabbit, You is not the rooster,\nZi is not Kan, Wu is not Li.\nThe First, Second, Third, and Fourth are not in the intestines,\nHolding to fullness—why cling to the moon’s fullness?\n\nThe liver is not the dragon, the lungs are not the tiger,\nHow can essence and radiance be called the elixir’s mother?\nThe Five Phases are but one Yin and Yang,\nThe Four Images do not depart from the Two Mysterious Females.\n\nThe source of the medicine’s river is not easily known,\nMercury arises in the East, lead in the West.\nThe sun’s soul in the Li position is the Alchemical Girl,\nThe moon’s spirit in the Kan palace is the Infant Boy.\n\nAct without acting, learn without learning,\nPratyeka-buddhas and Sravakas all rely on this.\nI now reveal the entire mechanism in one phrase:\nBody and mind are both fire and medicine.\n\nWhen body and mind are settled, the mysterious aperture opens,\nEssence, qi, and spirit naturally merge in emptiness.\nAfter three hundred days, the fetal spirit sheds its husk,\nTurning the body, it shatters the Great Void.\n\n*Two Songs of the Mysterious Principle*\n\nThough the Supreme Dao has no fixed abode,\nIt still relies on a master to transmit its rules.\nZhun and Meng take their images from dawn and dusk,\nFu and Gou borrow winter and summer, calling them Zi and Wu.\n\nAdvance the fire within nothingness to refine the Great Elixir,\nSet the furnace and stabilize the cauldron to seek true earth.\nBody, mind, and intent—three households united,\nLead, mercury, silver, and cinnabar share one origin.\n\nAdditions and subtractions follow the poem’s order,\nGuarding the city, I distinguish host and guest.\n\nThe Red Child of South Mountain rides the Azure Dragon,\nThe Metal Elder of North Sea mounts the White Tiger.\nThese two medicines blend in perfect fusion,\nA pair of tortoise and serpent naturally inhale and exhale.\n\nDirectly transcending the actual to return to the Great Vehicle,\nSudden enlightenment and perfect penetration are no small aid.\nThe secret meeting of the true mechanism is inherently natural—\nPity those petty methods that vainly prop themselves up.\nWith clever tongues and eloquent speech they boast of skill,\nArrogant in qi and haughty in heart—who dares challenge them?\nBefore learning to settle the mind into profound darkness,\nWhy trouble oneself with lofty aspirations in the garden’s walls?\n\nBeginners naturally refuse to seek a master,\nYet in old age, having achieved nothing, they endure suffering.\nAccumulating merit and piling up deeds to fill three thousand,\nThey reflect inward and turn their light back to exhaust the two and five.\nThe fire rises in the east as the tiger roars in the wind,\nThe dragon moves through rain, sweeping dust at the western extreme.\nCommanding thunder and lightning, they employ the celestial stems,\nAiding the upright and expelling evil, the Dark Warrior takes its task.\n\nThe Enchanting Maiden has just left the Purple Ultimate Palace,\nThe Metal Elder has already arrived at the Vermilion Mound.\nWithin the furnace, the great medicine forms as a single pill,\nIn the chamber, the fetal immortal dances in triple rhythm.\nThe four images and five phases all harmonize,\nThe nine returns and seven reversals complete their universal work.\n\nThe bright toad emerges from its hermitage,\nIts radiant light filling the vast universe.\nTo govern people and serve Heaven, nothing surpasses frugality—\nFrugality is called the weighty accumulation of virtue.\nThe nature of Heaven is vast, yet it deeply examines the roots of dust,\nThe paths of principle are many, yet they increase karmic consciousness.\nA heart bright with wisdom is no match for simplicity,\nGrand eloquence and lofty discourse vie in vain with silence.\n\nCut off thoughts, forget schemes, and be free of right and wrong,\nConceal brilliance, contain splendor, and distance yourself from sound and color.\nWith few desires and plain flavors, good roots reach fulfillment,\nReducing affairs and simplifying ties, the root of virtue is planted.\nA single thought fuses with the myriad voids, all clarified,\nThe three minds are refined, and all conditions cease.\n\nCarefully observe the books of the sages of the Three Teachings—\nThe word \"cessation\" is the simplest and most direct.\nIf you cultivate effort on cessation,\nTo become Buddha or immortal requires no labor.\nCessation of conditions reveals the root—Chan’s mechanism,\nCessation of the heart illuminates principle—Confucianism’s ultimate.\nCessation of breath congeals spirit—Daoism’s mystery,\nThese three cessations support one another, and nothing is not overcome.\n\nI speak to Zhitang and Tian Jiaochan:\nUltimately, one’s own mind is the rule and measure.\n\n*Song of Nature and Principle*\n\nThe Two Modes first divided into the Three Ultimates,\nQian is upright and steadfast, Kun opens and closes.\nBetween Heaven and Earth lies the Mysterious Female’s gate,\nThe more it moves, the more it emerges; the more it is still, the more it enters.\nThe orthodox transmission of the Dao points to the return,\nConfucius taught Zengzi, Zengzi taught Ziyu.\nWind follows the tiger as clouds follow the dragon,\nFire seeks dryness as water flows to moisture.\n\nTo harmonize and investigate things follows a proper order,\nTo enter sagehood and transcend the ordinary has no steps.\nThe noble person dwells in ease to await destiny,\nInwardly examining and finding no fault, what worry or sorrow remains?\nTo extend application and clarify the mechanisms of life and death,\nPreserving the body ultimately depends on the hibernation of dragon and serpent.\n\nTurn the light back to illuminate the dreamlike body,\nDirectly overturn the old volumes of scripture.\nPolish away the dust and scrape off the grime to sever the roots of dust,\nRelease burdens and purify the heart, free from defiling habits.\nSettle the mind into subtlety, and through resonance, it penetrates—\nThe ten thousand miles of the Yangtze River are swallowed in a single gulp.\nWhy need the Qian cauldron to refine golden essence?\nNo need for the Kun furnace to simmer jade nectar.\n\nThoroughly penetrating before Fuxi drew the trigrams,\nThe world is gathered and hidden within a millet grain.\n\n*Song of Fire Phases*\n\nTo forge the mysterious within the mysterious, one must be vigilant in solitude,\nThe work of vigilance in solitude lies in the mechanism of the eye.\nSever all ties to sensory dust, free from slander or disgrace,\nThe square inch of the heart becomes clear and empty, gleaming like jade.\nPush emptiness to its utmost, guard stillness with sincerity,\nWithin stillness, a single movement—yang returns.\nThe first nine: the hidden dragon must be restrained,\nAdvance to the \"seeing dragon\" but do not rush too quickly.\n\nAs soon as \"vigilant and tireless\" shines within,\nIt may leap or rest in the abyss—this is the time of bathing.\nThe nine five: the flying dragon achieves transformation and nurturing,\nYang at its peak, yin arises—one must retreat.\nGuard against the subtle and block the gradual at Kun’s initial six,\nRetreat to \"upright and square,\" metal and wood conjoin.\nThe six three: do not be honored with emolument,\nAfter \"tying the sack,\" the divine elixir ripens.\nIf you encounter wild battles, restrain your ambition,\nYin eroded, yang pure—the fire phase is complete.\n\nA single precious pearl is swallowed into the belly,\nBecoming a complete immortal and celestial kin.\nOne husband and one wife ever in harmony,\nThe three pairs and three oddities follow in timely pursuit.\nThe Plain Girl and Azure Lad rest together,\nBlack mercury and red lead naturally gather.\nThe void constructs a dwelling of non-action,\nThis master is truly extraordinary.\n\nMountains conceal clouds, Heaven and Earth grow solemn,\nThe radiant toad’s light illuminates the empty valley.\n\n*Song of Dragon and Tiger with Preface*\n\nDragon and tiger are alternate names for yin and yang.\nThe transformations of yin and yang are wondrous and unfathomable,\nThus they are symbolized by dragon and tiger.\nThe *Appended Judgments* of the *Book of Changes* says:\n\"One yin and one yang are called the Dao; yin and yang unfathomable are called spirit.\"\nThe alchemical texts say: \"Partial yin or partial yang is called illness.\"\nYin and yang are the movement and stillness of the Great Ultimate.\nDivided into two, the clear ascends and the turbid sinks;\nVast as Heaven and Earth, small as all things,\nAll receive the two qi of yin and yang and take form and name.\nThus, between the covering and bearing,\nFrom the most minute to the most vast,\nNothing lies outside the course of yin and yang.\n\nThe alchemical classics and philosophical texts,\nWith their myriad alternate names,\nDo not exceed the two words yin and yang.\nThe immortals of past ages,\nUsing metaphors and establishing symbols,\nCompared them to dragon and tiger,\nSo that students could easily grasp the pattern and succeed.\n\nThe images of dragon and tiger,\nEndlessly transforming, wondrous and inexhaustible,\nAre thus compared to medicines,\nEstablished as the furnace and cauldron,\nOperated as fire phases,\nCompared to kan and li,\nBorrowed as metal and wood,\nNamed as male and female,\nPaired as husband and wife.\nThese alternate names all express the wondrous functions of dragon and tiger.\n\nBy their numinous responsiveness, they are called medicines;\nBy their ability to form things, they are called furnace and cauldron;\nBy their transformations, they are called fire phases;\nBy their mutual assistance, they are called kan and li;\nBy their hardness and straightness, they are called metal and wood;\nBy their rising and sinking, they are called male and female;\nBy their wondrous union, they are called husband and wife.\nWithout dragon and tiger, how could these be fully expressed?\n\nThe *Wenyan* says: \"Clouds follow the dragon, wind follows the tiger; when the sage arises, the myriad things observe.\"\nThis elucidates the virtue of Qian’s nine five.\nThus, the wondrousness of dragon and tiger—\nWithout divine virtue and sagely achievement, how could one be worthy of them?\n\nTurning inward to seek, this is the nature of one’s feelings and essence;\nTransforming and cultivating them, this is body and mind, soul and spirit, essence and qi.\nExtending and practicing this, it is the gate of the Mysterious Female, the mechanism of opening and closing.\n\nThe *Taishang* says: \"The valley spirit does not die—this is called the Mysterious Female. The gate of the Mysterious Female is called the root of Heaven and Earth.\" Subtly continuous, as if present—its use is inexhaustible.\n\nThe *Yi* says: \"Closing the door is called Kun; opening the door is called Qian. One closing and one opening is called change; ceaseless coming and going is called penetration.\"\n\nThe *Elixir Scripture* says: \"Exhaling connects to the root of Heaven; inhaling connects to the root of Earth—this is the mechanism of Qian and Kun’s opening and closing. Exhaling, the dragon hums and clouds arise; inhaling, the tiger roars and wind is born—this is one closing and one opening called change. Wind and clouds respond and unite, transforming to generate the golden liquid—this is ceaseless coming and going called penetration. The golden liquid returns, congealing into the Great Elixir, hence provisionally named the Dragon-Tiger Great Elixir. Gathering and ingesting it, one attains longevity and enduring vision—this so-called breathing is not that of mouth and nose. The true mechanism’s wondrous response is the gate of one emergence and one entry. If you can penetrate this, the Dragon-Tiger Elixir will form, and immortality may be hoped for.\n\nThose who cultivate the truth, if they can thoroughly master and fully penetrate the Dragon and Tiger, though the Way of true constancy is called most profound and subtle, how could they fear failure? As for planting good roots, establishing virtue’s foundation, and nurturing the sacred embryo, none have succeeded without clarifying the Dragon and Tiger.\n\nMaster Ziyang said: \"Gathering body and mind is called subduing the Dragon and Tiger. When the mind is unmoving, the dragon hums; when the body is unmoving, the tiger roars. The dragon’s humming consolidates qi; the tiger’s roaring congeals essence. When primordial essence congeals, it suffices to preserve form; when primordial qi is consolidated, it suffices to concentrate spirit. When form and spirit are both wondrous, they unite with the Dao in truth—thus the immortal’s task is complete. If not one of utmost spirit in the world, who could attain this?\"\n\nZhao Shuzhai, a native of ancient Hangzhou, served as a eunuch in his youth, holding the office of palace attendant. Through the turning of Qian and the revolving of Kun, he saw through the illusions of floating life, thus abandoning profit and renouncing fame to seek the essentials of the Dao. Though he mingled in the red dust, his heart dwelled in the realm of mystery—a true transcender of worldly affairs. Desiring to blend and congeal spirit, he focused his mind on the Dragon and Tiger. One day, he brought this diagram to me, asking for an inscription. I declined, but he insisted, so I took up my brush to fulfill my duty.\n\nI said to him: \"The ancients established images based on the Dao; you now establish words based on images. Zhao Shuzhai, the key lies in sharpening your discernment, observing the teachings’ precision, and not mistaking the fixed pole star. If you can grasp the meaning through words and comprehend the intent through the diagram, you will know that the true Dragon and true Tiger are not on paper but within yourself. When words and images are both forgotten, virtue and the Dao are complete.\"\n\nAh! The true Dragon and true Tiger are not hard to find—just draw forth yang to supplement yin. With the Four Virtues circulating Qian without cease, hidden flight and manifest leaping are all at the heart’s command. Though it begins on level ground, it surges like waves in the blue sky, resounding like thunder.\n\nStrive on, strive on!\n\n*Song:*\n...\n\nThe true Dragon and true Tiger originally have no form—\nwho then devised a model to transmit this pattern?\nIf you grasp them within the formless,\nyou fall into rigid duality, forever reckless and wild.\n\nGreen and white, too distinct and clear—\nthis is but waves rising without wind.\nIf one would know the true Dragon and Tiger,\nthey belong neither to being nor non-being, nor to the axis of zi and wu.\nDo not confuse the two and swallow them whole;\nsimply reverse the count of the Five Phases.\nRoot and sprout dwell in the Palace of Great Mystery,\nwhile creation unfolds in the Crimson Numinous Treasury.\nThough their operation has a guiding principle,\nin truth, the numinous void has no fixed abode.\nA single great Dao demands the heart’s penetration;\na trace of divine mechanism is not seen by the eye.\nSuddenly, the crown gate opens—\nyou discern that Wood and Metal share one mother.\nLofty, beyond the highest peak, the Big Dipper’s handle is broken;\nbright, the Silver River’s ladle pours forth.\nClouds rise and mists form through Ding’s power;\nlightning flashes and thunder is driven by the Dark Warrior’s might.\nIn an instant, Heaven and Earth unite;\nin a moment, Kan and Li are mended.\nThe Tiger stirs a pure breeze from water’s depths;\nthe Dragon descends sweet rain from fire’s midst.\nThunder moves, rain falls, the world is at peace—\nthe Dragon’s virtue circulates Qian, its merit universally bestowed.\n\nPeople say six dragons bear the heavens,\nbut who knows the one Dragon is the true sovereign?\nPeople say five tigers pierce the Mysterious Pass,\nbut who knows the one Tiger arises from true earth?\nWhen you grasp that Dragon and Tiger are ever in harmony,\nyou will see the Tortoise and Serpent mutually devour and disgorge.\n\nThe sage sets forth images to point to the snare’s trace;\nbeyond images, clear words become mere chatter.\nBeyond words, you must fathom the ancestral intent—\nin truth, the Great Ultimate was originally without mark.\nTo grasp the meaning and forget the image is not yet exceptional;\nonly when meaning too is forgotten do you reach the ultimate norm.\n\nI bow to Zhao Shuzhai, the recluse—\nhaving thoroughly overturned all, his study of the mysteries is complete.\n\n*Song of No-One:*\nThe Dao, fundamentally formless, gives birth to the Great Ultimate;\nthe Great Ultimate transforms, and first there is One.\nOne divides into Two, Two begets Three—\nfrom this arise the Four Images and Five Phases.\nNo-One is the root of Heaven and Earth;\nthe Mysterious Teaching’s One is the gate of all wonders.\nChange begins within the One to unfold creation;\nthe human heart’s One governs the warp of the cosmos.\nHeaven attains One and is clear; Earth attains One and is tranquil;\nvalleys attain it and are full; spirits attain it and are numinous.\nThings attain it and are completed; people attain it and live;\nlords and kings attain it, and the world is upright.\nChan transmits the true Dharma within the One;\nConfucianism opens and closes from the One character.\nLaozi expounded true constancy through the One;\nZengzi’s “only One” is wondrous beyond measure.\nThe Dao has Three Vehicles, Chan five schools—\nyet in the end, a thousand lamps share one light.\nEmbrace the Origin, guard the One, and the Mysterious Aperture opens;\nbe precise, be one, and the Sage’s Teaching is illuminated.\nThe True One of Great Mystery is the Gate of Returning to Life—\nknow that the One is the true constant Dao.\nDo not say that attaining the One completes all things;\nattain the One, hold to the One, and never lose it.\nWhen the One penetrates all, Heaven’s principle is clear—\nyet the myriad methods returning to One are not yet extraordinary.\nAt first, the One and the formless give birth to the myriad existents;\nexistence and non-existence mutually sustain and endure.\nIf you can return the myriad existents to the formless One,\nonly then will you face south and behold the Northern Dipper.\nAt this point, having attained the One, you must forget the One—\nthen you may emerge and submerge with the primordial transformation.\nIf you cling to the One and cannot forget,\nyou are like a foolish cat guarding an empty burrow.\nThe Three and Five merge into One, returning to the void;\nafter returning to the void, the void too vanishes.\nWhen non-void is no more, all is profoundly still—\nthe Western barbarian’s beard and whiskers are gone.\nPeople today call non-being “non-being,”\nwandering in boundless emptiness, treading perilous paths.\nPeople today call the One “the One,”\nstubbornly clinging, wasting effort in vain.\nIf you can grasp the non-being that is not nothingness,\nthen in guarding the One, you will know the One is no-One.\nThe two words “One” and “non-being” are both overturned—\nMaster No-One has completed the great task.\n\n*Song of Embracing the One:*\nThe Non-Ultimate becomes the Great Ultimate;\nthe Great Ultimate spreads its wonders beginning with the One.\nOne divides into Two, giving birth to yin and yang—\nthe myriad kinds and Three Powers arise from this.\nOriginally, the true One is utterly void and numinous,\nunchanging from ancient times to the present.\nOnly because essence takes form and spirit awakens to knowing\ndo the mechanisms of good and evil, causes and conditions, diverge.\nFollowing emotions and chasing illusions, brambles grow thick;\nfragrance, flavor, color, and sound all delude and confuse.\nIf you can investigate the root and origin through the One,\nreturning to the origin and restoring the fundamental requires no effort.\nOne man and one woman unite in the center’s embrace—\nthree daughters and three sons cannot be contained within.\nThe Three Primes and Eight Trigrams meet in ren;\nthe Four Images and Five Phases return to utmost stillness.\nSuddenly, the crown gate is broken open—\nflashing golden light fills the spirit chamber.\nThe valley of the formless naturally opens;\nthe Gate of the Mysterious Female opens and closes of itself.\nThe return of the one yang is wondrous beyond measure;\nthe Four Virtues circulate Qian without cease.\nVast qi congeals the spirit in profound obscurity,\nemerging into existence, entering into non-existence, in the realm of the indistinct.\nWhat is the master within?\nIt is the original possession of the enlightened gentleman.\n\n*Song of the Wisdom Sword:*\nSince the perfected one transmitted the sword’s secret,\nthe true command is fully raised, resolute and decisive.\nIf someone asks me to reveal its trace and origin,\nI say it is no ordinary iron.\nThis lump of iron\nemerges from the kun direction;\nonce it enters my hand, it becomes majestic.\nFiercely refined in fire upon fire,\nthrough a hundredfold refinement, it becomes steel.\n\nYou who study the Dao, know this secret—\nthe yang spirit’s might destroys yin demons.\nIts divine power and wondrous use are truly immeasurable;\nI now lay bare its workings for you.\nI tell you,\nrevealing Heaven’s mechanism:\nbegin when the one yang returns.\nFirst command the six jia to fan the furnace bellows;\nthen the six ding wield the pincers and hammer.\nWhen the firing is complete, the sword is forged—\nat first, it gleams like lightning.\nWielded horizontally, a chilling wind arises;\nplunged upright, a bright moon appears.\nThe bright moon appears,\nradiant light shines—\nflashing to earth, illuminating the sky, gods and ghosts lament.\nIt stirs the turbid and lifts the pure, sweeping away evil and filth,\nslaying dragons, beheading tigers, annihilating serpents and oysters.\nThe six thieves perish, the three corpses are severed—\nties are cut, thoughts cast off, the net of emotions is torn.\nWhere the divine blade points, mountains crumble—\nthe demon kings of the three realms are all destroyed.\nThis precious sword\nis originally formless;\nits divine power forces it to be named.\nTo study the Dao and cultivate the real, rely on this sword—\nwithout this sword, the Dao is hard to achieve.\nIt opens primordial chaos, orders Heaven and Earth—\ndissolving obstacles, transforming dust, nothing is beyond its reach.\nIf someone asks to borrow it and see,\nI will take it up and show you—do you understand?\n\n**\"Song of Drawing the Crooked Back to the Straight\"**\n\nThe Dao arises from emptiness, birthing the One Qi—\nwho imposed names to divide the Five Ultimates?\nThe One Qi splits, giving rise to the Two Modes:\npure ascends, turbid descends, forming heaven and earth.\nYin and yang weave like a flying shuttle,\nwhile Qian and Kun open and close like bellows.\nThe Two Modes wondrously unite to form the Three Powers,\nand the seven apertures carved open birth the ten thousand kinds.\nThe true essence of the Limitless refines the primordial chaos—\nin daily use, it is ever-present, nothing excluded.\nThe hundred thousand transformations of life and change\nall unfold within this very skin-sack.\nIf you truly seek the root and origin,\nthe Four Symbols and Five Phases are already complete.\nReverse the three by day and night, undivided in purpose—\ncut off profit at its source, and merit multiplies a hundredfold.\nBreak through the Pass of Essence and the Pass of Qi,\nsilently fathoming the celestial and earthly melodies.\nEvery step aligns with the compass and square,\nevery aperture shines unimpeded.\nIf you possess eyes within this,\nyou merge the two into one.\nLift your head—Mount Sumeru topples;\ntake a step—the Mysterious Wondrous Camp collapses.\nGrasp this single principle to expound the true source,\nand the myriad differences converge in the right stream.\nRefine the yang spirit to transcend the yang spirit,\nrising from the realm of form to the formless realm.\n\nNow I see those who cultivate today—\nmost fabricate demons and conjure aberrations.\nTheir qi lofty and overbearing, they scorn their peers,\nflaunting wit and boasting of their own mastery.\nSharp in debate, they feign cleverness,\nriding high on empty talk, parading wisdom.\nNovices are deceived, the learned shun them—\nall for show, heedless of future calamity.\nChattering endlessly before others,\nlike selling water by the riverbank.\nFires of anger flare from stray thoughts,\nthe mind narrows, chasing circumstances.\nDissipating spirit in vain exertion,\nfeverishly flailing in chaos.\nRefining essence and moving qi—labor wasted;\ncounting breaths and massaging—mere fleeting pleasure.\nDrowsiness and distraction defy control—\nif not dull, then scattered—what recourse?\nSpirit wanes, qi scatters—how to heal?\nMarrow exhausted, form emaciated—regret comes too late.\nIf you seek the true Dao to escape delusion,\navoid repaying karmic debts.\nGather in your former reckless heart,\noverturn your past arrogance.\nExtend the heart of serving your father to serving your master,\nand first uphold the precepts to receive the teaching.\nExtend the heart of forgiving yourself to forgive others,\nnot blaming them, but bestowing goodness.\nNot self-enlightened, yet perfecting enlightenment;\nnot self-aggrandizing, yet achieving greatness.\nWithout affairs, without desires, without knowledge—\ndiscard excess, discard extravagance, discard excess.\nEstablish the foundation and begin with strict discipline,\nrefining through every encounter and circumstance.\nRely solely on lead and mercury as the elixir’s head—\ndo not mistake mud for treasure.\nMoreover, the upper and lower must alternate in sequence,\nnot mistaking east and west for Zhen and Dui.\nThe exchanged pear and fire-date are not kidney and heart,\nthe wood-fluid and metal-essence are not liver and lung.\nDo not cling to Pratyekabuddhas or Śrāvakas,\nnor to views, knowledge, or learned explanations.\nIn the end, nurture the child within the nothingness—\nthe dhyāna heavens purified, free of the tiniest speck.\nThe mechanism of nine returns and seven reversals\nlies neither within nor without.\nThe original true form is formless,\neternally luminous, never obscured.\nEmbrace the One and guard unity, enfolding all emptiness—\nsteadfast in purpose, diligent in practice, never lax.\nHarmonize the Four Symbols, gather the Three Origins,\nassemble the Five Phases, unite the Eight Trigrams.\nRefine *geng* and temper *jia*, with withdrawals and additions,\nknowing the advance and retreat of yang fire and yin tally.\nIn the stillness of emptiness, the mechanism turns—\nin the indistinct and profound, creation revolves.\nTwo numinous beings enter the Central Palace,\na single golden light illumines all directions.\nThe Old Woman of Huang in the southwest,\nbeats the drum to wed the Ding Maiden of Nanling.\nThe Green-Clad Girl returns to her chamber,\nthe White-Headed Lord enters the house.\nHusband and wife unite in yin and yang,\nclouds and rain forget day and night.\nQi solidifies, essence congeals—forming the sacred embryo,\ngiving birth to a wondrous pearl, most rare.\nFour-sided, it gleams with radiance,\neight-faced, flawlessly smooth.\nThis small round sphere—\nten thousand taels of gold could not match its

Returns and Seven Reversions—\nseekers must seek it within stillness.\nIf you grasp this subtle mechanism,\nthe two numinous substances will unite.\nThree years’ creation is completed in an instant,\nnine cycles’ work circles in a moment.\nThen overturn the crucible and furnace—\nthe elixir’s light illuminates the four divine continents.\n\nNo written texts are established for transmission beyond the teachings,\nfor in each person’s portion, the original perfection is already complete.\nThe subtle breeze of the Mysterious gently purifies the three realms,\nthe moon of wisdom shines brightly, imprinting the hundred rivers.\n\nThe Three Gates of Tusita are but metaphors,\nthe single finger of the Heavenly Dragon is no true explanation.\nBeyond the sound of thunder, messages are conveyed—\nthis is not Zhou Dunyi’s Supreme Ultimate circle.\n\n**Four Conditions to Warn the World**\n\nBody, mind, worldly affairs—four empty names,\nhow many deluded souls are ensnared by them?\nCalamity arises only from grasping at power and profit,\nthe wheel of rebirth turns solely for love’s attachments.\nTo pacify the mind, sever all traces from the body’s movements,\nin the world, forget scheming and let things take their course.\nWhen encountering circumstances, always yield and comply—\nthus the foundation of life is eternally firm, and nature perfectly luminous.\n\n**Ode to the Gourd**\n\nThe numinous sprout’s seed is born of the primordial,\nits stem firm, roots deep—such is the principle of nature.\nDaily, it is nurtured with earth from Kun’s position,\ntimely, it is watered with springs from Kan’s midst.\nIts blossoms open like white jade, radiant and lustrous,\nits seeds form like yellow gold, round and firm.\nWhen the work is complete, a single aperture opens atop—\nwithin, a distinct Qian and Kun are revealed.\n\n**The Heart-Mirror**\n\nGather Qian’s ore into Kun’s furnace,\nthe six directions and empty space become one mold.\nWhen the Dharma-image is formed, it shines resplendent,\nwhere mercury is polished, it gleams like jade.\nIts radiance extends throughout the three thousand worlds,\nits gathering returns to a single millet-grain pearl.\nLift it clearly, and the whole body appears—\nyet one must shatter it to unite with the original pivot.\n\n**For Fuan Hermitage: Pointing to the Mysterious Female**\n\nThe Mysterious Gate’s female portal is not hard to know—\ngather body and mind, and turn inward.\nWhen you grasp the principle of the Two Modes’ ebb and flow,\nyou will understand the qi’s coming and going.\nQian and Kun open and close without cease,\nLi and Kan rise and sink, unite and part.\nFor Fuan Hermitage, I clearly point this out—\nwhere thoughts return, the elixir’s foundation is laid.\n\n**Matching the Rhymes of Weng’s Learning Record**\n\nHidden meanings probe the *Cantong Qi* with White Jade Toad,\nonly by exhausting principles does one become a transcendent.\nBefore the Supreme Ultimate gives rise to the Three and Five,\none vainly treads the eight thousand leagues to Penglai.\nThe Śākya family’s tradition relies on the ancestral seal,\nthe Fuxi lineage’s Dao must be transmitted heart-to-heart.\nThe jade terrace’s moon alone shines in the azure sky,\nimprinting a thousand pools with the same perfect roundness.\n\n**For Deng Yichan**\n\nChan, Confucianism, and the Perfect Real—\nteachings establish three gates to guide later generations.\nŚākya’s tradition stores emptiness, one must see nature,\nConfucian scholars investigate things, they must preserve sincerity.\nThe Elixir Terrace retains a spark of fire,\nthe numinous palace melts away all dust.\nWhen you grasp that the myriad differences return to one,\nwithin and beyond the Terrace of Joy, spring reigns everywhere.\n\n**Seven Poems on Self-Attainment**\n\nShatter the vast chaos’ aperture—\nno Buddhas, no immortals remain.\nIt is neither a marvel beyond the heart,\nnor a Chan phrase on the lips.\nDays pass in carefree ease,\nnights in unrestrained sleep.\nEntrusting the body to the hidden, absolute realm,\nall things are left to Heaven.\n\nAll conditioned dharmas,\nevery one, are but dust.\n\nPursue the principles of all things to their end,\nlay down this heart and body.\nWherever you are, settle into meditative stillness,\nfollowing the times, delight in the true.\nOften wield the marrow of the *Zhouyi*,\nto rouse and awaken the worldly.\nHaving attained the wondrous subtlety of non-action,\nyou need not step beyond your door all day.\n\nAll karmic conditions are wholly severed,\nHeaven’s principle naturally abides.\nIn daily use, Heaven’s movement is strong,\nin the ordinary, Earth’s bearing is receptive.\nAdmonish your disciples at the gate,\nreturn to life and revert to the root.\nBreak through every barrier and lock,\nnaturally merging into the Great Harmony.\n\nTortoise hair was always green,\nthe crane’s crown was ever red.\nWhat can be spoken is not the eternal Dao,\nexternal practices are but superficial work.\nThis child is truly of the creative process,\namidst the indistinct and profound.\nAttaining stillness of body and mind,\nconcentrate the spirit, solidify the essence.\n\nThe body at leisure transcends the leaky,\nthe heart in quiescence realizes non-arising.\nSun and moon come and go as ever,\nHeaven and Earth change at will.\nVast and unobstructed,\nthe great radiance alone shines forth.\n\nIn daily life, nothing else matters,\nbut to uphold one’s own sincerity.\nIn stillness, regulate the breath,\nin movement, follow human feelings.\nConceal virtue to blend with the common,\nembrace refinement without display.\nIn the place of true leisure and joy,\never still and ever pure.\nEmbrace nameless simplicity in stillness,\nworldly passions cannot intrude.\n\nMercury and lead melt into powder,\ntiles and stones transform into gold.\nYearning to see the faces of Fuxi and the Yellow Emperor,\nto harmonize the hearts of Śākya, Laozi, and Confucius.\nSuddenly empty, transcending the actual,\nno past, no present.\n\n**Inscribed on My Portrait**\nA sallow-faced, emaciated fellow—\nwhat’s so extraordinary about that?\nClearly, those are but borrowed eyes,\nyet you claim all hearing and knowing are cut off.\nHaving seen through the three thousand dharmas,\nI’ve harmonized the teachings of seventeen masters.\nBowing my head, hands clasped—\nall pretenses are utterly exposed.\n\n**Two Poems on the Mirror and Lamp**\nThe precious mirror is originally formless,\nthe transmitted lamp emits wisdom’s light.\nTrue Suchness is inherently pure,\nthe Dharma-body fundamentally radiant.\nThe golden crucible burns with true fire,\nthe flowery pond bathes in the great sun.\nWithin this, the essential meaning\nnever departs from the central yellow.\n\nIn the quiet chamber, the heart-mirror opens,\nin the empty hall, the wisdom-lamp is trimmed.\nWithout, it shines brightly,\nwithin, it glows resplendently.\nA grain of millet appears in the light,\nthe silver toad is clear in the water’s depths.\nSuspended in the golden crucible,\na single grain of the great elixir congeals.\n\n**Two Poems on the Lotus Root**\nA singular numinous sprout,\nunlike all others.\nThe Dharma-body is inherently immaculate,\nthe true nature originally flawless.\nOutwardly, every part is curved,\nwithin, every aperture is connected.\nMired in mud, it cannot be submerged,\nbursting forth in crimson across the pond.\n\nI am a seed of purity and emptiness,\nflawless through the ages.\nWeary of the clutter of fame and profit,\nI hide deep in the mud.\nEver harboring the intent to aid others,\nconstantly holding a heart of self-restraint.\nSo many who dredge and strain—\nwho among them is a true kindred spirit?\n\n**Two Poems on the Hermitage**\nHaving chosen the most empty and formless ground,\nkarmic conditions reside in the Jade Capital.\nLay the foundation firmly,\nset the crucible level.\nErect a pillar as tall as Mount Sumeru,\nplace the crossbeam of the Supreme Ultimate.\nThe blue sky serves as the roof,\nthe hermit delights in non-arising.\n\nThe earth is leveled as if carved,\nthe hermitage’s foundation is completed today.\nThe incoming mountain enters from the south,\nthe departing water flows west.\nDoors and windows are all unobstructed,\nthe lattice panes are thoroughly bright.\nWho is the hermit’s companion?\nThe white moon and the clear wind.\n\n*End of Scroll Five of the* Zhonghe Collection\n*Scroll Six of the* Zhonghe Collection *begins*\n\n**Six Lyrics to \"Spring in the Garden of Seepage\"**\n*Composed by Li Daochun Yuan-su of Jingchan of Duliang Hermitage*\n*Compiled by Disciple Sunchan Baochanzi Cai Zhi-yi*\n\n**I**\nTo meet true transmission is to know where to begin—\nsuccess is not difficult.\nWait for the moment *gui* is born:\ndraw forth lead, add mercury,\nfire must not be too dry,\nwater must not be allowed to chill.\nStir the *xun* wind,\nfan open the furnace-bellows—\nmartial refinement and literary simmering are no trifling matter.\nWithin the golden crucible,\nthose two numinous substances\nare forged into an elixir pellet.\nFirst, you must shatter the web of doubt,\nthen penetrate the barrier of returning to the root and reviving life.\nLet the Red Child ride the dragon,\nfetch water from the Palace of *Li*;\nlet the Metal Lord mount the tiger,\ncirculate fire to scorch the mountain.\nThe Metal Lord remains silent,\nthe Enchanted Maiden gathers her sleeves—\nin a single hour, the elixir is wrought.\nSwallow it whole,\nand you will attain the adamantine indestructibility,\ntranscending the human realm.\n\n**II**\nDwelling in the Mystery Gate,\nwithout encountering a true master,\nyou labor in vain.\nIf you sever learning and non-action,\nhow can you know opening and closing?\nWith much learning and wide knowledge,\nhow can you escape the dust of roots and dust?\nClinging to the natural,\nyou end in annihilation—\nclinging to being or non-being, neither is real.\nAll is false—\nwhere is the subtlety in those stars?\nSeek out a master of the highest order.\n\n**III**\nA single word breaks open the primordial cause,\npointing straight to the essence of the elixir head—\n*jing*, *qi*, and *shen*.\nAsk where the Mysterious Pass lies:\nit has no fixed location.\nThe two numinous substances\nreside only in heart and body.\nMovement and stillness interdepend,\nbeing and non-being interpenetrate—\nthe five *qi* return to the origin, and myriad virtues gather.\nIn the profound and wondrous place,\ncluster the One Origin\ninto a single hour.\n\n**IV**\nThe Dao speaks of the Five Phases,\nBuddhism of the Five Eyes,\nConfucianism of the Five Constants.\nMoreover, benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom—\ntrust is their root;\nmetal, wood, water, fire—\nearth abides at the center.\nWhite Tiger, Azure Dragon,\nDark Turtle, Vermilion Bird—\nall emerge from the Five Lords of the Celestial Hook.\nThe celestial number is five;\nthe human spirit, *hun*, *po*,\nand intent belong to the Central Yellow.\nHeaven and Earth reveal the two fives in full—\nwhen the three and five unite,\nthe marvel of returning to the origin is beyond measure.\nFire, two, in the south;\neast, three, makes five;\nnorth, the Mysterious True One;\nwest, four, is its kin.\nThe five earths of the central palace,\ncombined into three and five—\nthree and five merge, yin returns to yang.\nThe adept of the Mysterious,\nwith lead, silver, cinnabar, mercury,\nrefines them into adamantine gold.\n\n**V**\nThe Dao is fundamentally empty and formless,\nthe formless gives birth to the One,\nthe One and Two become Three.\nFrom Three, the myriad things are born—\nall things are transformed by emptiness,\nform after form is transmitted,\nthing after thing interpenetrates.\nEach body is fundamentally empty,\neach head is originally One—\nthis is not to be discussed casually by ordinary people.\nThe wonder of emptiness and formlessness\npossesses form, name, and appearance,\nencompassed within the empty.\nDelve deeply into the secret meaning within emptiness—\nto reach the ultimate emptiness,\ninquire of Lao Dan.\nThat empty and quiescent stillness,\nthe ultimate within the non-existent;\nemptiness and formlessness thoroughly realized,\npiercing the teachings of Gautama.\nBefore the Emperor of Images,\nbeyond the Shore of Thunderous Sound—\nwho else but the pure, empty, and formless?\nAll the hosts of the Mysterious,\nthrough emptiness and formlessness, meet the Dao—\nbowing in reverence, they pay homage.\n\n**VI**\nWho clasps hands?\nWho joins palms?\nWho raises a fist?\nThese mere tricks—\npeople still misunderstand them.\nThe wondrous principle of non-action—\nwho truly grasps and upholds it?\nFor all of you,\nI clearly set forth:\nLaozi, Gautama, and Confucius are one.\nPonder past and present—\nthe thousand worthies and ten thousand sages\nare all the work of human hands.\nPitiful are later learners, devoid of knowledge—\ndistinguishing right from wrong,\ntrue from false, has no end.\nMoreover, heaven, earth, and humanity\nshare a single source, divided in response;\nDaoists, Confucians, and Buddhists—\none principle, what doubt is there?\nSeeing nature and illuminating the heart,\nprobing the subtle and reaching life’s end—\nto be a Buddha or an immortal lies only in this.\nAfter the work is accomplished,\nthough paths differ and schools diverge,\nin the end, they all return to the same.\n\n**VII**\nI tell you, learners:\nfire has no weight,\ntiming has no hexagrams or lines.\nThere is no drawing forth or adding,\nno action to be taken—\nno form or image,\nno need for refinement or firing.\nEach is unreal,\nall is false—\nto labor with intent is but vain toil.\nDo you understand?\nAll sounds and sights\nare but confusion and delusion.\nCast aside seeing, hearing, knowing, and awareness—\nstrike through to the numinous terrace, leaving not a single hair.\nNo more talk of furnaces and hearths,\nno seeking of medicinal substances.\nThe numinous remains undimmed,\nthe will and power firm and steadfast.\nThe spirit-chamber is empty and at ease,\nthe numinous source clear and still—\nwithin it, naturally, heaven and earth commune.\nThose who attain perfection—\nif they do not perfect their true nature,\nhow can they escape the kalpas’ turning?\n\n**VIII**\n*Oral Instructions for Jing’an*\nThe primordial spirit spanning kalpas,\nthe ancestral *qi* from the beginningless,\nthe primordial essence of the Great Origin—\nthese three supreme treasures\nshare a single root and stem.\nIf you seek the truth,\ndo not cling to bodily form.\nCalm the breath, settle the spirit,\nabide in emptiness, solidify the *qi*—\nin purity and non-action, essence naturally congeals.\nThe elixir head forms,\ncirculate the fire of yin-yang symbols,\ngently harmonizing.\nAbove all, secure and sustain fullness—\nrefine lead, mercury,\nsilver, and cinnabar together.\nThe Four Images harmonize,\nthe foundation of life is eternally firm;\nthe Three Origins converge,\nawakened nature is empty and numinous.\nNature and life both perfected,\nform and spirit both wondrous—\nuniting with the Dao, unchanging.\nIn carefree wandering,\nroam the eight poles at will,\nfree and unfettered.\n\n**IX**\n*For Master Qing of Chungu*\nWisdom severs with firm resolve,\nthe heart rouses with decisive ardor—\nthus the Mysterious Pass is penetrated.\n\n**For Master Qing of Chungu (continued)**\nGrasp the blade that slays with ease,\ngently reveal the knife that revives—\nslowly teach its use.\nA single sword cleaves the sky,\nten thousand entanglements swept away,\nthen trust that Śākyamuni and Laozi are one.\nThe Mysterious Wind spreads—\nbehold spring blooming in the frozen valley,\na face-to-face encounter with compassion’s visage.\nLet snow blanket a thousand peaks—\nthat jagged, solitary summit\nstands blue as indigo.\nWhat of striking bamboo or plucking flowers?\nAll become relics.\nRaising brows, blinking eyes—\nmere carelessness.\nBeyond kalpas, the radiance of this moment,\nhere and now, is grasped.\nTear open the mask of appearances,\nthen cease inquiry.\nWhat is the ancestral master’s intent?\nPalms pressed, bowing in reverence.\n\n**For Zhang Xiwei of Kuocang, styled Jian’an**\nUnknowing, unhearing,\nsoundless, scentless—\nthis is called *xiwei* (subtle obscurity).\nThis alone is the wondrous root of perfect truth.\nWhoever penetrates it\ninstantly knows the subtle.\nHearing dharma, hearing sutras,\ndiscoursing on Chan, expounding the Dao—\nclinging to forms, mired in texts,\nall are false.\nDo you yet awaken?\nThis ordinary daily use\nis the entire mystery.\nStill, rely on decisive ardor in practice—\ngather the Four Images,\nthe Five Phases,\nreturn them to their source.\nMaster the marvelous union of the Two Modes,\nthe convergence of the Three Origins.\nOne spirit undimmed,\nten thousand transformations return.\nEssence and *qi* congeal into spirit,\npassions revert to nature.\nForth streams the toad’s light,\nilluminating all realms.\nIn wondrous form and spirit,\nbeyond the Great Void,\nalone stands the towering peak.\n\n**The Winding Path and Side Trails**\nThree thousand six hundred gates,\neach differing in method.\nIf you cling to the body,\nyou remain bound to things.\nIf you depart from form,\nyou fall into hollow emptiness.\nWithout dual practice,\nhow to proceed?\nAbandoning both is illogical.\nCultivators of truth—\nif you know not the Mysterious Aperture,\nyour labor is in vain.\nThis small marvel is fathomless.\nOnly by direct seeing\ncan you reach the root of the lineage.\nIt cannot be heard,\ncannot be grasped.\nGazing, it seems present;\nseeking, it vanishes without trace.\nEach possesses it from the start,\nyet none recognize it.\nI reveal this celestial mechanism to you:\nthe Mysterious Aperture,\nthe workings of emptiness and creation—\nall reside within.\n\n**For Layman Wu on the Alchemical Principle**\nIn the upward work,\nthe cauldron stands in the *qian* palace,\nthe furnace rests in the *kun* position.\nThis fire-phase is subtle,\nrequiring no effort—\nadvancing and retreating,\nno need for contrivance.\nYin departs, yang arrives,\nclouds drift, rain falls—\nthe mechanism of mastery lies within.\nWith the heart settled,\nthat empty numinosity undimmed,\nilluminates the darkest paths.\nOnce the nature-school awakens to the luminous pearl,\nthis life-root completes the Supreme Polarity.\nBeyond the circling circles,\nradiant light emerges.\nWithin the storing-storing,\nalone beholds true suchness.\nOne *qi* returns to the root,\nthe six gates interpenetrate.\nAt this stage, rely wholly on virtue’s support.\nAmid the dust of the world,\nconceal your edge and sharpness—\na perfected ordinary man.\n\n**For Recluse Zhou, the Leisurely One**\nThe true cauldron, the true furnace,\nneither nonexistent nor existent,\nonly upright and centered.\nWithin stillness, apply the work;\nin quiescence, revolve the mechanism.\nMotionless yet responsive,\nsubtly interconnected—\nthe old oyster nurtures its pearl,\nthe mantis charms its young,\nsuch is the wondrous mechanism,\ninexhaustible in marvel.\nThis alone—\nonce the knot of doubt is shattered,\nsuddenly awakens to true emptiness.\nGathering lead without leaving the *kun* palace,\nwield the fire-symbol,\nstirring the *xun* wind.\nFrom the heart of the northern sea’s waves,\ncapture the White Tiger.\nWithin the southern mountain’s fire,\nseize the Azure Dragon.\nThe two substances merge,\nthe three barriers converge—\nrefined, the divine elixir fills the cauldron, crimson.\nWhere to conceal the body?\nHarmonizing with light, blending with the world—\nthis is called *xuantong* (mysterious sameness).\n\n**For Zheng Songxi**\nSeeming clumsy, seeming foolish,\nseeming indolent, seeming lazy,\nseeming dull, seeming witless—\nthis alone is the daily practice of the profound.\nIf you truly enact it,\nit secretly accords with the divine mechanism.\nScholarly understanding, intellectual knowledge,\nthe *śrāvaka* and *pratyekabuddha*,\nall swell the roots of dust, stuffing the belly—\nutterly useless.\nOnly by dying to the heart, treading the earth,\ndoes life equal heaven’s span.\nThe golden immortal dwells not in the western sky—\nno need to mention the blue-eyed foreigner.\nInquire into the nature-school’s single move:\nfrom emptiness, awaken yourself.\nIn the life-root’s affairs,\ntake solidity as the foundation.\nVoid and solid interpenetrate,\npresence and absence merge—\nform and spirit unite, ascending to sagehood.\nThe zenith of Chan is pure.\nBehold clouds veiling mountains,\nmoonlight gilding the pines by the stream.\n\n**For Sun’an on Entering Stillness**\nNine revolutions of effort,\nthe Three Origins’ creation,\na hundred days to establish the foundation.\nThen rouse the spirit,\nhold fast to resolve,\noverturn delusion,\nsever doubt.\nRaise the brows,\nopen the heart—\nevery thing, every head,\nswept away with a single stroke.\nIn the act of practice,\nthe Dipper’s handle is dragged sideways,\nthe celestial sphere revolves in reverse.\nIn the midst of action, grasp non-action—\nthat which is not-none,\nwithin it, the most marvelous.\nAt the threshold of the indistinct,\nthe verge of the obscure—\nto guard it is delusion,\nto abandon it is error.\nNeither guard nor forget,\nneither restrain nor indulge—\nexamine this *storing-storing-storing*—\nwho is it?\nJust so—\nawait the completion of the six yang phases,\nthen embrace the toad’s child.\n\n**For Attendant Wang**\nThe sea of wisdom, deep and clear,\nthe mountain of virtue, towering and steep—\nthe master is no ordinary man.\n\nMoreover, to grind down sharpness and resolve entanglements, to dismiss cunning and set aside cleverness—\noverturning self and other, yet leaving no trace of mechanism or restraint.\nResolve stands in emptiness, the mind abides in primordial chaos,\nprobing the hidden intent before the image of the Lord.\nIn the depths of the profound—\nthe old master’s original surname,\none thread through the three.\nOnce he joined the loftiest adepts in arcane discourse,\nthus in silence, in darkness, he merged with Lao Dan.\nHow much more in the numinous realm of emptiness and leisure,\nthe zenith of Chan, serene and still—\nforgetting knowledge, forgetting perception,\nno north, no south.\nGathering in body and mind,\nfusing with the workings of creation,\nall within is overturned to form a sanctuary.\nWhen the divine elixir is complete,\nbehold its perfect roundness,\nilluminating the Song Hermitage.\n\n**Exhortation to Zhong’an on the Wondrous Use of Holding the Center**\nThe center is the Confucian lineage,\nthe center is the Daoist root,\nthe center is the Chan mechanism.\nOf the three teachings’ family ways,\nthe center is the swiftest path;\nof the five constants and hundred practices,\nthe center establishes the foundation.\nIn movement and stillness, attain the center,\nhold fast to the center without wavering—\nthen peer into the subtleties within the center.\nWithin its essence lies the delight,\nrevealed in words—\nbeware of doubt.\nDo you yet know the workings of this center?\nIt lies neither in the midst nor the four directions.\nIn daily life’s plainness,\nthrough the center it operates;\nin rising, dwelling, eating, and drinking,\nall is enacted within the center.\nPenetrate this center,\nand you grasp the center’s body—\nthe character \"center\" originally admits no opposition.\nWhen the center is fully realized,\nsplit it open with the center—\nonly then are you a true man.\n\n**For Abbot Yuan of the Round Hermitage**\nThe human heart is perilous,\nthe heart of Dao is subtle,\nwithin the center lies the mechanism of transformation.\nWhere is its wondrousness?\nIt arises from no contrivance,\nluminous and unobscured,\nthe radiance of wisdom’s moon.\nWhether called *qi* or spirit,\nwhether refined or unified,\nlike jade without flaw, heaven and earth return to it.\nIn the realm of the profound,\ntake the single stroke within Kan,\nand move it into Li of the South.\nThe red dragon coils around the black turtle,\nin the sixth month, frost bears strange fruit.\nThat white-haired old man\ncomes to wed the plain maiden;\nwhen the fetal immortal’s dance concludes,\nthey enter the yellow curtain together.\nClouds bring rain, winds carry harmony,\nyin and yang flow in accord—\na year’s effort nurtures the child.\nConstantly nurture it,\nawaiting the Jade Emperor’s decree,\nthen ascend on clouds to return.\n\n**Exhortation to All Disciples**\nThe Dao resides in ordinary people,\nin the midst of daily use—\nyet people remain unaware.\nAlas, amidst the tangled web of perceptions,\nthe surging red dust,\nthe spirit’s source is unsettled,\nthe moon of the heart lacks radiance.\nThe mountain of self and other looms high,\nthe sea of right and wrong stretches wide—\noverturn all, and you approach the subtle.\nAll you noble ones,\nhear the parable of the Clear Hermitage—\nbeware of doubt.\nFirst take purity as the foundation,\nuse stillness and stability\nas the hermitage’s self-sustaining abode.\nLet the center be the gate,\nrectitude the forest and couch,\nsincerity the path,\nreverence the fence.\nBe humble and yielding with others,\nmodest and respectful in dealings—\nin eating, dwelling, rising, and resting, do not transgress.\nPractice this constantly,\nand if your effort never slackens,\nyou will enter non-action directly.\n\n**To the Tune *Man Jiang Hong*: For Xu’an**\nIn daily practice,\nonly one flavor—\nembrace emptiness, hold to simplicity.\nWhen diverse paths converge as one,\na hundred thoughts unite in singularity.\nIn the Purple Pole Palace, the primal *qi* breathes;\nwithin the suspended crucible, the three flowers gather.\nAsk how to tend the furnace, establish the crucible—\ncast with the metal of Qian.\nBind the golden crow,\nseize the jade hare,\ncapture them,\nseal them in the earthen cauldron.\nIn the firing’s ebb and flow,\ntake greater care in guarding.\nWhen the jade treasure is perfectly formed, it shines in entry and exit;\nthe Dharma-body’s form leaves no trace of coming or going.\nThen conceal yourself,\nascend directly to the Great Clarity Palace—\nthe spirit abides eternally.\n\n**In Praise of Shui’an, Steward Yin**\nWho is the hermitage’s child?\nWho stands within,\nupholding the hermitage?\nSeeing hunger come, he eats—\nwho knows the sweet and bitter?\nThe notes of horn and zither—who discerns them?\nThe hues of blue, yellow, black, and white—who can perceive them?\nIn the ordinary exchanges of daily life,\nwho makes the distinctions?\nWho walks?\nWho lifts?\nWho is silent?\nWho speaks?\nPenetrate these,\nand you know host and guest.\nThe outer form—who fashions it?\nThe inner gate—who comes and goes?\nIn non-action’s end,\nwho ultimately dwells in the hermitage,\nthe Scarlet Mound Palace?\n\n**Instructions for Jue’an**\nThe Dao is fundamentally natural—\nbut to act is error at every turn.\nIf you merely discourse on emptiness,\nhow can you grasp it?\nTo forget both being and non-being never concludes;\nto employ both sides is to be ensnared.\nNothing compares to silently guarding the center—\nthe spirit at ease, joyful.\nPast affairs—\nforget them.\nFuture matters—\ndo not ponder.\nIn the present’s work,\ndo not cling.\nThe six desires do not arise, the three poisons are extinguished;\nwhen the single yang returns, the host of yin is stripped away.\nAwaken to true emptiness,\nembrace the root and return to original emptiness—\nthis is true awakening.\n\n**For Magistrate Ding: The Three Teachings Share One Principle**\nThe three teachings’ true transmission—\nthis path,\noriginally so direct.\nAsk of Laozi’s mechanism—\nultimate emptiness, utmost stillness.\nThe Buddha’s nature is awakened within emptiness;\nConfucius’ principle enters through sincerity.\nFrom the beginning, though the teachings branched into three,\ntheir source is one.\nThe Dao’s mysterious gate\nconstantly responds to things.\nThe *Yi*’s subtleties\nmust be silently grasped.\nThe Chan school’s profound essence—\ntrue emptiness, utmost quiescence.\nMoment by moment, uphold it without interruption;\nlifetimes of use know no end.\nThen return to the root,\nrestore life to the body of original emptiness—\nconcealed in utmost secrecy.\n\n**For Li the Sleeping Daoist Judge**\nA fine sleeping family tradition—\nanother kind of\nsleeping samadhi.\nAs long as the heart is sincere in sleep,\nthe mind is clarified within sleep.\nOnce the method of sleep is mastered,\nwithin sleep you harmonize spirit and *qi*.\nThis sleeping practice—\nits subtleties in peaceful Chan—\nfew understand.\nThough the body sleeps,\nthe nature is not obscured;\nthough the eyes droop,\nthe inner vision is not closed.\nIn deep sleep,\nsteady and secure—\na pillow of cool breeze chills the bones,\ndreaming beyond the world in carefree play.\nUpon waking,\nthe body rests in the Palace of Broad Cold,\nembracing the toad in slumber.\n\n**In Praise of Layman Fu of the Round Hermitage**\nThis circle,\nsince time immemorial,\nhas borne no form.\nMoreover, upright and proper,\npoised and balanced—\nentering the finest dust, it leaves no shadow;\nencompassing the cosmos, it finds no place to rest.\n\nYet it traverses heaven and earth, unbound in all directions,\nno barriers obstruct.\nRootless origin, formless state—\nglittering bright, radiant and round.\nThis alone is the original visage.\nReleased, it soars straight beyond the formless realms;\nrecalled, it hides within the treasury of light.\nWait until the crown bursts open to reveal perfect penetration—\nthe golden countenance.\n\n**In Praise of Prefect Zhang of Zhi Hermitage**\nOnly upright, only centered—\nthis is the secret formula for cultivating immortality.\nShould there be the slightest bias,\nmovement breeds distinction.\nTry to maintain steadfastness amid motion,\nand naturally within stillness the mechanism becomes thorough.\nComprehending the Three Origins and Five *qi* entering the Yellow Court,\ngolden flowers bloom.\n\nThe firing process has its seasons:\nthe ocean tide rises, the moon in the sky.\nThat which ascends and descends,\nwaxes and wanes.\nTen months of unbroken effort,\nand the wondrous one transcends birth and death.\nIf you ask me of the matter beyond—\nno words suffice.\n\n**In Praise of Mi Hermitage’s Exposition of the Three Teachings**\nThere are three teachings,\nyet at their ultimate point, they are originally one.\nThis single-character Dharma-gate\nis fathomless in depth.\nLaozi’s Valley Spirit is ever undying,\nConfucius’ *Xin Yi* initially without design.\nAsk of Śākyamuni’s mind beyond teaching—Nirvāṇa—\nprofound, profound, profound.\n\nTo learn the immortal’s way, stabilize the breath.\nTo learn the sage’s way, forget knowledge and perception.\nAs for the Buddha’s mechanism of attainment,\nit relies solely on the power of wisdom.\nDaoist, Buddhist, and Confucian streams—all are penetrated,\nthe work of perfect clarity and luminous awareness complete.\nBehold the crown breaking through to see true suchness—\nradiance blazing.\n\n**In Praise of Zong the Daoist of Wei Hermitage**\nThe work of observing return\nrequires silent, steadfast preservation.\nIn the midst of extreme stillness, a single movement—\nthen the mysterious and the female are penetrated.\nWithin

understand all buddhas of the three times, one should contemplate the nature of the dharma-realm—all is created by the mind.\" This means that where there is creation, there is transformation, and both creation and transformation arise from the mind. People commonly say that the creator of the myriad things is the artisan of creation. I alone hold otherwise. Creation fundamentally has no artisan; the myriad things create and transform themselves. Why? Because all things possess this mind, and where this mind exists, there is creation and transformation—is this not self-creation and self-transformation?\n\nMoreover, all forms in the world arise from non-being into being—this is called *creation*. Once born, they must perish; perishing, they return to non-being—this is called *transformation*. Creation and transformation in endless succession are the constant nature of things. The true nature of the One Reality is originally present, existing without form, and thus without creation or transformation—this is the constant Way. People only recognize the absence of creation and transformation as non-creation, failing to see that the great creation abides therein. Who but the enlightened can comprehend this?\n\nThe enlightened, with wisdom all-pervading, perceive all things as empty, return the mind to stillness, and abide in solitary transcendence—thus they are beyond creation and transformation. Those who lack enlightenment cling outwardly to body, mind, and worldly affairs, and inwardly dwell in sensation, perception, volition, and consciousness. Thus they follow the world’s vicissitudes and the cycle of birth and death.\n\nWhat the eye sees is called *form*. Its reception in the mind is called *sensation*. Once received, it becomes *perception*. Perception unceasing leads to *volition*. Volition, whether good or evil, yields corresponding *karmic consciousness*. The ceaseless flux of karmic consciousness is the root of rebirth—thus one cannot escape creation and transformation. If one is not entangled by illusory conditions, not defiled by sense-dust, not obstructed by deluded emotions, not afflicted by craving and desire, then one can perceive the emptiness of the five aggregates. With the five aggregates empty, where is creation and transformation? This is the wondrous mind of nirvana.\n\nI say that creation and transformation arise from the mind—what doubt remains?\n\nThe Daoist texts say: \"Being and non-being produce each other.\" This means that non-being generates being—creation—and being generates non-being—transformation. They also say: \"Attain utmost emptiness, guard absolute stillness; while the myriad things arise together, I observe their return.\" This is to observe the return and know transformation. Knowing transformation, one is no longer transformed; without transformation, how can there be creation? Who but one of unimpeded insight can attain this?\n\nThose of penetrating vision, pure and luminous, can discern the illusory nature of body, mind, and worldly affairs. Within the illusory, what has form is called a thing; when things reach their extreme, they revert, reflecting back into the illusory. One who contemplates thus knows that the formless form is the true form. Nurturing the formless, form endures; preserving the formless, the body remains whole and true. In perfect purity and wholeness, one merges with the great square, vast and boundless, transcending the void—this is beyond creation and transformation.\n\nThose who cling, unsettled in body and mind, assailed by thoughts, lose the formless and scatter the formless body, thus drifting in the cycle of birth and death, forever sinking in the sea of suffering. If one gathers in body and mind, dispels thoughts, prevents the inner from leaking outward and the outer from intruding inward, achieving inner and outer purity, this is called *illumination*. When one forgets the mind within and the body without, the One Reality shines clearly, like the vastness of empty space, unimpeded by creation and transformation—what then remains?\n\nThe Confucian texts say: \"Neither envious nor covetous, free from blame and praise.\" This means that without envy or desire, one does not undergo creation; without blame or praise, one does not undergo transformation. The *Book of Changes* says: \"Look afar to things, and near to oneself.\" I say: looking afar to things, one knows all conditions are illusory; looking near to oneself, one knows the five aggregates are empty. Externally, one screens off all conditions; internally, one dissolves the five aggregates—thus one accords with heaven’s workings and delights in the celestial.\n\nKnowing the beginning and end of things, the causes of the hidden and manifest, the principles of life and death, one exhausts principle and fulfills nature, reaching destiny. Delighting in heaven, one is free from sorrow; fulfilling nature, one is free from doubt. Who but one who attains knowledge can reach this? One who attains knowledge is sincere, luminous, still, and settled—thus one knows that ceaseless birth and death belong to illusory form; inequality and discord arise from the deluded mind; impermanence and change pertain to the times; decay and ruin are the fate of affairs. Through refined observation and practice, this is called *sagehood*; unified in one principle, one is beyond creation and transformation.\n\nWithout attaining knowledge, one cannot investigate things; failing to investigate things, one is swayed by their changes—where then is nature and destiny? If one is not fixed but circulates through the six directions, then heaven and earth unite with me, and the myriad things are complete in me. When one again perceives the heart of heaven and all things return to the One Non-being, creation and transformation cease.\n\nFor example, if heaven and earth did not move, if the sun and moon did not revolve, what would become of the six lines? Without the six lines interacting and reconfiguring, without yin and yang ascending and descending, what would become of the myriad things? The essence of heaven and earth is pure and undivided, unchanging in inversion or uprightness—thus there is no creation or transformation. To create the creationless is the great creation; to transform the transformationless is the great transformation. One who sees thus knows that all things in the world are temporary combinations, and the workings of yin and yang are nothing but illusion. Who but the most profoundly adaptable can match this?\n\nFrom this perspective, the Three Teachings are but the mind; creation arises from the mind, and transcending creation also arises from the mind. The essence of Buddhist practice lies in seeing one’s nature. To see one’s nature, one must first resolve with unwavering determination to overcome habitual energies, and with disciplined effort, preserve the luminous clarity within. Only then can one illuminate and break through all illusions, the mind not clinging to things, thoughts not following emotions.\n\nThought is the root of affliction; the mind is the seed of dharmic dust. When thought arises, all afflictions arise; when thought ceases, all afflictions cease. When the mind arises, all dharmas arise; when the mind is extinguished, all dharmas are extinguished. The arising and cessation of thought depend entirely on one’s own mind. When birth-and-death are extinguished, and quiescent extinction becomes bliss, this is seeing one’s nature.\n\nToday’s learners fail to see their nature because they are obstructed by the two hindrances of principle and phenomena. Without great insight, one cannot dissolve the hindrance of principle; without great cessation, one cannot remove the hindrance of phenomena. Great insight means wisdom and severance; great cessation means power and restraint. When wisdom and severance are pure and mature, all principles become empty; when power and restraint are pure and mature, all phenomena become empty. Comprehending the great emptiness of the three emptinesses, and knowing the supreme truth of the one true reality—this is the ultimate of great insight. At that moment, body, mind, worldly affairs, thoughts, emotions, and consciousness all cease together—this is the ultimate of great cessation. Without the highest wisdom, who can attain this?\n\nThe essence of Daoist practice lies in preserving one’s nature. To preserve one’s nature, one must first wield the sword of wisdom to slay the hordes of demons and use the fire talisman to dissolve the six desires. Next, with the power of concentration, one forgets emotions and cuts off thoughts, releases burdens and purifies the mind. When the mind is purified, burdens are released, thoughts are cut off, and emotions are forgotten—this is preserving one’s nature. Once true nature is preserved, there is no creation. Today’s learners are seized by emotions and consciousness. To eliminate emotions and consciousness, one must first remove the mind of birth-and-death. When the mind is free from birth-and-death, the body is free from birth-and-death—this is stability. To remove the mind of birth-and-death, one must cultivate the habit of no-thought until it is pure and mature, sufficient to attain dreamlessness. When the stillness and stability of no-thought are pure and mature, one can attain birthlessness. Dreamlessness is the great matter of the present; no-thought is the great matter of the end. Birthlessness means no creation; dreamlessness means no transformation. Without creation or transformation, there is no birth or death. Without the most exalted of beings, who can attain this?\n\nThe essence of Confucian learning lies in fully realizing one’s nature. To fully realize one’s nature, one must illuminate the luminous virtue and rest at the highest good. Knowing where to rest, one then attains stability; with stability, one can forget both self and others. The *Yijing* says in the *Gen* hexagram: *\"Stopping at the back, one does not obtain the body; walking in the courtyard, one does not see others—no blame.\"* Stopping at the back means forgetting the mind; not obtaining the body means forgetting the self; walking in the courtyard without seeing others means forgetting things. When these three are forgotten, what blame can there be? This is the ultimate of knowing where to rest. Knowing where to rest, one can forget self and others and fully embody heavenly principle—this is fully realizing one’s nature.\n\nToday’s people cannot fully realize their nature because they are burdened by body and mind. With burdens come obstructions; one must be resolute and decisive. Resoluteness enables one to forget things; decisiveness enables one to forget the self. When both self and things are forgotten, one fully realizes one’s nature and stabilizes one’s destiny. Without divine virtue and sagely merit, who can attain this?\n\nI see that most people regard this body as having a self—how profoundly they fail to reflect! This body exists because of creation; before creation, was there form? Was there name? Was there a self? After transformation, will there be form? Name? A self? Both before and after, there is nothing—how can one stubbornly cling to a self in the middle? They do not realize that body, mind, and worldly affairs are fundamentally illusory; tracing them through the three times, nothing can be found. The past is utterly gone—where is it? The present changes with every thought. The future will certainly be the same. Through kalpas of time, in this great dream and illusion, stubbornly clinging to false conditions, one accumulates the seeds of samsara, thus entering birth and death without end.\n\nIf there is someone in this dreamlike realm who awakens, understands, and skillfully navigates it, is this not a supreme person? One day, I presented this koan to my disciples for contemplation. Two or three of them somewhat grasped its essence, so I wrote this text to bestow upon them, transmitting mind with mind. If one can directly accept and silently comprehend it, instantly knowing where to rest, without scheming for the future or worrying about the past, without clinging to the present—when these three merge into one, one attains great freedom. Roaming in the ocean of great quiescent extinction, wandering in the realm of nothingness, swimming in the field of self-attainment—only then does one realize that creation has nothing to do with this.\n\nYet there is still something beyond. What is this \"something beyond\"? Hmph! Overturn the foot of the wordless, shatter the great void—only then is one a true man of the Way. Keep this secret, keep it secret.\n\n**On the \"No-Learning Without Worry\" and Its Preface**\n\nWhat is called \"no-learning\" is not non-learning. If one takes non-learning as no-learning, one remains ignorant and indistinguishable from the common crowd. This so-called no-learning is the culmination of extensive learning. Most people learn to be extraordinary, but the more they learn, the less they understand. The sage said: *\"The farther one goes, the less one knows.\"* And also: *\"Much leads to confusion; little leads to attainment.\"* This is precisely the point. A former Confucian said: *\"With effort, one rests all day; without effort, one does not rest.\"* This is the same idea. Thus, I write this piece to demonstrate it, so that learners are not burdened by the hearer and solitary realizer vehicles, or by intellectual understanding and discriminative knowledge.\n\nIn daily life, all is profoundly mysterious,\nYet people do not fully recognize it.\nOne should pursue what the heart truly loves,\nAnd let go of mere verbal Zen.\n\nEvery dharma is not an empty dharma;\nEvery transmission is a false transmission.\nWithout cultivating blessings first,\nHow can misfortune arise prematurely?\n\nWithout gain, there is no loss;\nWithout change, how can there be alteration?\nWithout defilement, there is no purity;\nWithout lack, there is no completeness.\n\nDo not cling to anger or joy;\nWhy worry about adversity or obstruction?\nWithout doing good as cause,\nHow can evil conditions arise?\n\nUnconcerned with rise and fall,\nName and profit do not entangle.\nCoarse and fine incur no worry or aversion;\nBeauty and ugliness evoke no hatred or love.\n\nUnburdened by debts of joy,\nNo entanglements of gratitude or resentment remain.\nBreaking free from the net of self and others,\nLeaping beyond the circle of right and wrong.\n\nIn clarity and emptiness, antiquity holds no charm;\nIn tranquility and simplicity, the pursuit of worthies wearies.\nCease pondering the life to come,\nRelease the thoughts of what precedes birth.\n\nLet Buddhas be Buddhas,\nLet immortals be immortals.\nFreed from the dust of worldly burdens,\nWhy fear the searing flames of karma?\n\nNeither existence nor nonexistence is established;\nVacuity and reality intertwine as they will.\nAll arises from non-grasping, non-rejecting—\nNaturally, no faults or transgressions arise.\n\nComing and going are wholly forgotten;\nWhat concern is there for death or life?\nDwelling leaves no lack or excess,\nEverywhere adapting to square or round.\n\nHunger comes—take a bowl of rice;\nThirst arises—drink half a cup of spring water.\nWhen inclined, amuse yourself;\nWhen weary, sleep.\n\nThe enlightened understand this principle—\nCease seeking heavens beyond heavens.\nBefore the eyes, all is radiant and clear;\nIn the end, all shines bright and pure.\n\n*Middle Harmony Collection, Scroll Six, Concluded*",

Based on the edition from the *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, *Dongzhen* section, Methods category.\n\n**Preface to the *Zhonghe Collection***\n\nCai Zhiyi of Sun’an in Weiyang was a disciple of Master Yingchan, Li Qing’an. Having seen through the illusions of the mundane world, he devoted himself to cultivating the immortal Dao. Gathering the remnants of his master’s teachings—scattered fragrance and lingering essence—he compiled them into this work, titling it the *Zhonghe Collection*, after his master’s chamber of stillness.\n\nIn the autumn of the *bingwu* year of the *Dade* era, he sought my approval, wishing to commit it to print and awaken later generations. Before I had even opened the scroll, I already knew that all delusions would be swept away and the One True [Reality] would stand revealed.\n\nIt speaks of the Mandate bestowed by Heaven as life, received by humans as nature; of the Primordial Supreme Polarity, the spontaneous Golden Elixir, its radiance illuminating the Great Void—requiring no artificial refinement—all secrets laid bare without omission. Through this, one may fathom the numinous and comprehend transformation, deepening the root and stabilizing the ultimate; one may shed the mortal coil and attain spiritual transfiguration, returning to the Non-Ultimate.\n\nMoreover, it reveals that the Dao is a thing of undifferentiated wholeness; that the Confucians’ “central harmony nurtures all things,” and the Buddhists’ “pointing to the mind to see nature,” though differing in method, all arise from the same Supreme Polarity. Thus, the ancient sages of Daoism were ever diligent in saving others; the Buddha did not slight even you; how could the Duke of Zhou deceive us?\n\nLet those who read this collection guard against doubt.\n\nWritten by Du Daojian of Nangu on the *Dangtu* road at the *Xianyuan Zhen* Hall in Qiantang.\n\n---\n\n**Zhonghe Collection, Juan One**\n\nComposed by Li Daochun, Yuan Su, the Pure Toad Master of Yingchan of Duliang.\nCompiled by his disciple, Cai Zhiyi, the Precious Toad Master of Sun’an.\n\n*The Mysterious Gate holds no fixed doctrine—*\n*Movement and stillness arise without origin.*",

      "translated_text": "The Unerring Manifestation\n*The Record of Rites* states: \"Joy, anger, sorrow, and delight—before they are aroused is called *zhong* (the Mean); when aroused and all in due measure is called *he* (harmony).\" Before arousal, in the stillness of concentration, one guards what is preserved within—hence it is called *zhong*. Preserved yet without form, it is thus called the great root of all under Heaven. When aroused and in due measure, in movement one guards what is expressed—hence it is called *he*. With every manifestation unerring, it is thus called the universal Dao of all under Heaven. If one can attain *zhong* and *he* within the body, then the original substance is empty yet numinous, still yet aware, and in motion upright. Thus one can respond to the endless transformations of all under Heaven.\n\n*Laozi* said: \"If one can constantly abide in clarity and stillness, Heaven and Earth all return.\" This is the same meaning as Zisi’s \"attaining *zhong* and *he*, whereby Heaven and Earth take their proper places and the myriad things are nurtured.\" *Zhong* and *he*—these are the wondrous functions of resonance and response, the pivot of adaptation to change. *The Book of Changes* embodies the ceaseless flow of generation and nurturance, the totality of every movement and stillness.\n\nIs it not fitting that I name my dwelling with the plaque \"Central Harmony\"?\n\n*Yielding and Accord*\nBody, mind, worldly affairs—these are the four conditions. All people in the world are entangled by them, yet only those who yield can respond. Constantly responding, constantly still—what entanglement remains?\n\nWhat is yielding?\nThe body yields in tranquil stillness, the mind yields in luminous clarity, the world yields in harmonious unity, affairs yield in natural spontaneity.\n\nWhat is accord?\nAccord with Heaven’s mandate, accord with Heaven’s Dao, accord with Heaven’s seasons, accord with Heavenly Principle.\n\nThe body in accord with Heaven’s mandate can thus respond to others;\nThe mind in accord with Heaven’s Dao can thus respond to things;\nThe world in accord with Heaven’s seasons can thus respond to change;\nAffairs in accord with Heavenly Principle can thus respond to opportunity.\n\nHaving mastered yielding and accord, and further mastered response, one is freed from the four conditions. Those who attain this insight abide in constant response and constant stillness, constant clarity and stillness.\n\n*The Diagram of Illuminating Delusion*\nAn ancient saying goes: \"Constantly extinguish the moving mind, not the illuminating mind.\" Every unmoving mind is the illuminating mind; every restless mind is the deluded mind. The illuminating mind is the mind of Dao; the deluded mind is the human mind. The mind of Dao is subtle, meaning it is profound and difficult to perceive. The human mind is perilous, meaning it is precarious and unstable. Though the human mind also contains the mind of Dao, and the mind of Dao also contains the human mind, this depends on the interplay of movement and stillness. Only those who sincerely hold fast to the Mean preserve the illuminating mind constantly, keep the deluded mind unmoving, transform peril into peace, and reveal the subtle in clarity. At this stage, the mind of delusion is restored, and the Dao of non-delusion is accomplished.\n\n*The Book of Changes* says: \"Return—is this not the manifestation of Heaven and Earth’s mind?\"\n\n*Eulogy on the Diagram of the Supreme Polarity*\nThe central circle ○ represents the Ultimateless that is the Supreme Polarity. The Supreme Polarity moves and generates yang; when movement reaches its limit, it becomes still, and stillness generates yin. With the interplay of yin and yang, the Two Modes are established. ○ represents the Two Modes. ○ represents yang in motion. ○ represents yin in stillness. Yin and yang intermingle, generating the Four Images. ○: when the Four Images move and move again, it is called *old yang*; when movement reaches its limit and becomes still, it is called *young yin*; when stillness reaches its limit and moves again, it is called *young yang*; when stillness persists in stillness, it is called *old yin*. The Four Images in their movement and stillness generate the Eight Trigrams: *Qian* (☰) as one and *Dui* (☱) as two represent the movement and stillness of *old yang*; *Li* (☲) as three and *Zhen* (☳) as four represent the movement and stillness of *young yin*; *Gen* (☶) as five and *Kan* (☵) as six represent the movement and stillness of *young yang*; *Xun* (☴) as seven and *Kun* (☷) as eight represent the movement and stillness of *old yin*. Yin in reverse, yang in sequence, ascending and descending without cease, the mechanism unfolds to generate the sixty-four hexagrams—here the Dao of the myriad things is complete.\n\nThe upper circle ○ is the beginning of qi transformation. The lower circle ○ is the mother of form transformation. To know qi transformation but not form transformation is to fail in attaining vastness. To know form transformation but not qi transformation is to fail in attaining subtlety. Thus a eulogy is composed to verify this.\n\n*Eulogy in Twenty-Five Stanzas*\nThe Dao is originally supremely empty, the supremely empty without form.\nExhausting the inexhaustible, beginning from the unbeginning.\nThe empty to its limit transforms into spirit, spirit’s changes generate qi.\nQi gathers to form shape, one divides into two.\nTwo then interact, interaction then brings pairing.\nYin and yang intermingle, *Qian* and *Kun* take their places.\nMovement and stillness unceasing, the Four Images interconnect.\nVigorous and yielding propel each other, the Eight Trigrams are thus linked.\nRevolving the Five Phases in constancy, establishing the four seasons to complete the year.\nPure harmony transforms into purity, providing origin and nurturance.\nIn Heaven it revolves the myriad images, on Earth it fosters the multitudes of beings.\nForms bequeath to forms, things conceive within things.\nTransformation upon transformation, generation upon generation—how could there be an end?\nAll things under Heaven are born from being, being is born from non-being.\nBeing and non-being interweave, the hidden and manifest support each other.\nTracing to their origin, all the myriad existents are fundamentally rooted in qi.\nTracing to their end, all the myriad things ultimately transform in form.\nThus we know that the myriad things are fundamentally one in form and qi,\nForm and qi are fundamentally one in spirit.\nSpirit is fundamentally supremely empty, the Dao is fundamentally supremely non-being—*The Book of Changes* is within them.\nHeaven takes its place above, Earth takes its place below.\nHumans and things dwell in the center, naturally blending and transforming—qi is within them.\nHeaven and Earth are the greatest of things, humans are the most numinous among things—Heaven and humans are one.\nThe cosmos is in one’s hands, the myriad transformations arise from one’s body—change is within them.\nThe ultimate of humans is to stand between Heaven and Earth and establish destiny,\nTo receive the empty and numinous and complete nature.\nEstablishing nature and establishing destiny—spirit is within them.\nDestiny is tied to qi, nature is tied to spirit.\nConcealing spirit in the mind, gathering qi in the body—the Dao is within them.\nForm transforms and there is life, with life there is death.\nEmerging from life and entering death—this is the constant of things.\nQi transforms and there is no life, with no life there is no death.\nNon-life and non-death—this is the constant of spirit.\nForm transformation embodies Earth, qi transformation images Heaven.",

form abiding, qi abides; qi abiding, then spirit abides; spirit abiding, there is no abiding—this is called the Abiding of No-Abidance.\nRefining form with golden liquid, preserving spirit with jade talisman.\nForm and spirit both wondrous, they unite with Dao in truth.\nThe treasure of destiny is congealed, the pearl of nature is luminous,\nThe primordial spirit is numinous, the Embryonic Immortal is achieved,\nThe Dao of emptiness and naturalness is complete.\nGreat indeed is spirit—is it not the root of all transformations?\n\n**Hidden Meaning Before the Hexagrams – First on the Images**\nThe *Yi* can be changed, yet is not the constant *Yi*.\nThe image can be imaged, yet is not the Great Image.\nThe constant *Yi* is unchanging, the Great Image is imageless.\nThe constant *Yi* is the *Yi* before the hexagrams were drawn.\nThe changing *Yi* is the *Yi* after the hexagrams were drawn.\nThe constant *Yi* unchanging is the body of the Supreme Ultimate.\nThe *Yi* that can be changed is the origin of creation.\nThe Great Image is the beginning of movement and stillness.\nThe image that can be imaged is the mother of forms and names.\nAbiding in quiescence through kalpas—this is the constant *Yi*.\nPervading antiquity without cease—this is the changing *Yi*.\nUtterly empty and without form—this is the Great Image.\nManifesting according to circumstances—this is the image that can be imaged.\nThe so-called constant is that whose beginning cannot be fathomed, whose end cannot be measured,\nThat which endures through a thousand myriad ages, vast and solitary in its existence.\nThe so-called great is that which externally envelops Heaven and Earth, internally fills the cosmos,\nPervades the worlds as numerous as the grains of the Ganges, serene and perfectly complete.\nThe constant *Yi* unchanging can thus govern the endless changes under Heaven.\nThe Great Image imageless can thus give form to the endless affairs under Heaven.\nThe *Yi* and the images—are they not the origin of the Dao?\n\n**Second on Constancy and Change**\nThe constant *Yi* does not change, the changing *Yi* is not constant.\nIts constancy does not change, thus it can respond to change.\nIts change is not constant, thus it can embody constancy.\nBeginning and end unchanging—this is the constancy of the *Yi*.\nMovement and stillness inconstant—this is the change of the *Yi*.\nStanding alone without alteration—this is attaining constancy.\nCircling without cease—this is penetrating change.\nWithout knowing constancy, one cannot penetrate change;\nWithout penetrating change, one cannot know constancy.\nConstancy and change—are they not the origin of the *Yi*?\n\n**Third on Substance and Function**\nConstancy is the substance of the *Yi*.\nChange is the function of the *Yi*.\nUnchanging through past and present—this is the substance of the *Yi*.\nChanging with the times—this is the function of the *Yi*.\nWithout thought, without action—this is the substance of the *Yi*.\nWith resonance, with response—this is the function of the *Yi*.\nKnowing its function, one can fully realize its substance.\nPreserving its substance, one can effectively employ its function.\nThe sage observes far and near, seeks distantly and proximately—thus attaining its substance.\nThe noble person advances virtue and cultivates work, acts and creates tools—thus following its function.\nAs for exhausting principle and fulfilling nature, delighting in Heaven and knowing destiny,\nCultivating the self and ordering the state, establishing laws and regulations—\nThere is nothing outside the *Yi*.\nFully realizing the substance of the *Yi* suffices to know constancy;\nEffectively employing the function of the *Yi* suffices to penetrate change.\n\n**Fourth on Movement and Stillness**\nHard and soft push and surge—this is the movement and stillness of the *Yi*.\nYin and yang ascend and descend—this is the movement and stillness of qi.\nOdd and even intermingle and accumulate—this is the movement and stillness of the hexagrams.\nQi and form wax and wane—this is the movement and stillness of things.\nDay and night, waking and sleeping—this is the movement and stillness of the body.\nAs for the body’s advance and retreat, the mind’s arising and ceasing,\nThe world’s opening and obstruction, affairs’ success and failure—\nAll are one movement and one stillness, mutually dependent and concealed.\nObserving their movement and stillness, the changes of all affairs and the conditions of all things can be seen.\nIn stillness, there is preservation; in movement, there is discernment.\nIn stillness, there is a master; in movement, decisions can be made.\nIn stillness, there is stability; in movement, there is no misfortune.\nStillness is the foundation of movement, movement is the mechanism of stillness.\nWhen movement and stillness do not lose their constancy, the Dao is luminous.\n\n**Fifth on Flexion and Extension**\nHeat departs, cold arrives—this is the flexion and extension of the year.\nSun departs, moon arrives—this is the flexion and extension of qi.\nPast departs, present arrives—this is the flexion and extension of the world.\nAs for being and non-being mutually arising, difficulty and ease mutually completing,\nLong and short mutually shaping, high and low mutually inclining—\nAll are the principle of flexion and extension.\nKnowing the Dao of mutual resonance in flexion and extension,\nOne can exhaust the endless benefits under Heaven.\n\n**Sixth on Waning and Waxing**\nWaxing is the beginning of waning.\nWaning is the end of waxing.\nWaxing is the gathering of qi.\nWaning is the dispersal of form.\nGrowing, nurturing, and maturing—this is called waxing.\nReturning to the root and restoring destiny—this is called waning.\nOriginating and penetrating—this is the waxing of the *Yi*.\nBeneficial and upright—this is the waning of the *Yi*.\nSpring and summer—this is the waxing of the year.\nAutumn and winter—this is the waning of the year.\nInfancy and maturity—this is the waxing of the body.\nOld age and death—this is the waning of the body.\nNon-being and being—this is the waxing of things.\nBeing and non-being—this is the waning of things.\nWaxing is the companion of life.\nWaning is the companion of death.\nSince the two qi first divided,\nThere has never been a principle of waning without waxing,\nNor has there been a thing that waxes without waning.\nThose who penetrate and understand this illuminate principle to its utmost clarity.\n\n**Seventh on Spirit and Mechanism**\nThat which abides within—this is spirit.\nThat which issues forth and hits the mark—this is mechanism.\nQuiescent and unmoving—this is spirit.\nResonating and penetrating—this is mechanism.\nHidden and unfathomable—this is spirit.\nResponsive and without fixed direction—this is mechanism.\nEncompassed within the body—this is spirit.",

the four virtues and ceaselessly strengthening oneself—this resides in spirit.**\n**Permeating the Three Powers and responding endlessly—this is the operation of mechanism.**\n\n**Eighth on Wisdom and Action**\n**Wisdom** is profound understanding of principle.\n**Action** is vigorous practice of the Dao.\nProfound understanding of principle is knowing without seeing.\nVigorous practice of the Dao is accomplishing without striving.\nNot stepping beyond the door yet knowing all under heaven,\nNot peering through the window yet perceiving the Way of heaven—\nThis is profound understanding.\nCeaselessly strengthening oneself, adapting to all circumstances—\nThis is vigorous action.\nKnowing disorder before it arises,\nKnowing danger before it emerges,\nKnowing ruin before it befalls,\nKnowing misfortune before it strikes—\nThis is profound understanding.\nAbiding in the body yet not burdened by it,\nMoving in the heart yet not enslaved by it,\nActing in the world yet not swayed by it,\nEngaging in affairs yet not hindered by them—\nThis is vigorous action.\nThose who profoundly understand principle can transform disorder into order,\nDanger into safety,\nRuin into preservation,\nMisfortune into fortune.\nThose who vigorously practice the Dao can attain longevity for the body,\nProfound tranquility for the heart,\nGreat peace for the world,\nAnd grand accomplishment in affairs.\nNone but those of great wisdom and great action can reach this.\n\n**Ninth on Discerning the Times**\nNothing surpasses recognizing the times for mastering change,\nNothing surpasses comprehending principle for recognizing the times,\nNothing surpasses emptiness and quiescence for illuminating principle.\nEmptiness brings clarity,\nQuiescence brings purity.\nWhen purity and clarity reside in the person,\nThe heavenly principle shines forth.\nThe transformations of heaven can be seen in the *Yi*.\nThe trends of the world can be verified in its images.\nThe truth or falsity of things can be discerned in their forms.\nThat which clings to form cannot be without its counterpart.\nThat which manifests in color cannot be without distinction.\nWhen heaven is about to bring rain, the *qi* must first steam.\nWhen a mountain is about to collapse, its base must first crumble.\nWhen a person is about to encounter profit or harm, their countenance must first change.\nIt is like the nest knowing the wind,\nThe burrow knowing the rain,\nHibernating creatures responding to the seasons,\nFalling leaves heralding autumn.\nOr like merchants placing pheasant tails on their boats and carriages\nTo forecast clear or rainy weather—\nWhen the sky is usually clear, the tail stands upright;\nWhen rain is coming, the tail droops.\nEven insentient things behave thus,\nHow much more so for humans?\nThose who fail to recognize the changes of the times\nHave not yet illuminated principle.\n\n**Tenth on Rectifying the Self**\nFor advancing virtue and cultivating endeavors,\nNothing surpasses rectifying the self.\nOnce the self is rectified, nothing remains unrectified.\nAll forms and names are not established without rectitude.\nAll affairs and events are not accomplished without rectitude.\nIn daily life, in planning and responding to others,\nNothing does not begin with the self.\nAll matters, principles, heads, and things\nAlso do not originate from anything other than the self.\nThus, the essentials of self-cultivation\nMust take rectifying the self as their foundation.\nRectifying the self in dealing with others—others will also return to rectitude.\nRectifying the self in handling affairs—affairs will also return to rectitude.\nRectifying the self in responding to things—things will also return to rectitude.\nOnly the single rectification of all under heaven\nCan penetrate the myriad changes of all under heaven.\nThus, rectifying the self is the great function of self-cultivation,\nThe ladder to sagehood.\n\n**Eleventh on Practice**\nClearing the heart and releasing burdens,\nCutting off thoughts and forgetting emotions,\nReducing selfishness and restraining desires,\nPreserving simplicity and embracing the uncarved—\nThis is the practice of the Dao of the *Yi*.\nWhen the heart is clear and burdens are released,\nOne can fully comprehend principle.\nWhen thoughts are cut off and emotions forgotten,\nOne can fully realize one’s nature.\nWhen selfish desires are entirely extinguished,\nOne can attain the Dao.\nWhen simplicity and purity are preserved,\nOne can know heaven.\n\n**Twelfth on Stimulus and Response**\nQuiescent yet penetrating,\nNon-doing yet accomplishing,\nNot seeing yet knowing—\nThis is the stimulus and response of the Dao of the *Yi*.\nQuiescent yet penetrating—nothing is not penetrated.\nNon-doing yet accomplishing—nothing is not accomplished.\nNot seeing yet knowing—nothing is not known.\nMoving and then penetrating is not true penetration.\nActing and then accomplishing is not true accomplishment.\nSeeing and then knowing is not true knowledge.\nThese three fall far short of the Dao of stimulus and response.\nOnly by acting before things arise,\nResponding before movement begins,\nPerceiving before sprouts appear—\nThese three advancing together—\nCan there be nothing that is not penetrated,\nNo affair that is not responded to,\nNo abiding that is not beneficial.\nThose who fully realize this Dao—\nIs it not Yanzi alone?\n\n**Thirteenth on the Three Eases**\nThe Three Eases are:\nFirst, the Ease of Heaven;\nSecond, the Ease of the Sage;\nThird, the Ease of the Heart.\nThe Ease of Heaven is the principle of the *Yi*.\nThe Ease of the Sage is the images of the *Yi*.\nThe Ease of the Heart is the Dao of the *Yi*.\nIn observing the Ease of the Sage, the value lies in illuminating the images—\nWhen images are illuminated, one enters sagehood.\nIn observing the Ease of Heaven, the value lies in exhaustively investigating principle—\nWhen principle is exhausted, one knows heaven.\nIn observing the Ease of the Heart, the value lies in practicing the Dao—\nWhen the Dao is practiced, one fully realizes the heart.\nWithout studying the Sage’s *Yi*, one cannot understand the Ease of Heaven;\nWithout understanding the Ease of Heaven, one cannot know the Ease of the Heart;\nWithout knowing the Ease of the Heart, one cannot master change.\nThus, the *Yi* is the book of mastering change.\n\n**Fourteenth on Resolving Confusion**\nThe waxing and waning of *qi*,\nThe rising and falling of times,\nThe prosperity and adversity of cycles,\nThe openness and blockage of the world—\nThis is the Ease of Heaven.\nThe auspiciousness and inauspiciousness of hexagrams,\nThe gains and losses of lines,\nThe perilousness and easiness of judgments,\nThe correctness and obscurity of images—\nThis is the Ease of the Sage.\nThe success or failure of fate,\nThe advancement or retreat of the self,\nThe success or failure of the world,\nThe safety or peril of position—\nThis is the Ease of the Heart.\nDeeply mastering the Ease of Heaven, one knows the trends of the times.\nDeeply mastering the Ease of the Sage, one knows transformations.\nDeeply mastering the Ease of the Heart, one knows nature and destiny.\nUniting the Ease of the Heart with the Ease of the Sage,\nMatching the Ease of the Sage with the Ease of Heaven,\nComparing the Ease of Heaven with the Ease of the Heart,\nAnd penetrating them as one—\nThis is called the consummate scholar.\n\n**Fifteenth on Dispelling Doubts**\nChange and movement have their times,\nSafety and peril lie within oneself.\nFortune and misfortune, gain and loss—\nAll begin with the self.\nThus, those who master change are those who follow the times.\nThose who follow the times—\nEven in peril, they find safety.",

      "translated_text": "**Exposition on the Diagrams of Outer and Inner Medicines of the Golden Elixir**\n\nOuter medicine can cure illness and bestow longevity. Inner medicine can transcend the mundane and enter the formless from the formed. Generally, those who study the Dao must begin with outer medicine before naturally grasping inner medicine. The most exalted adepts, having long cultivated the root of virtue, are born with this knowledge—thus, they refine inner medicine without first refining outer medicine.\n\nInner medicine is non-action yet all-accomplishing; outer medicine is action with deliberate purpose. Inner medicine is formless and insubstantial yet truly existent; outer medicine has form and function yet is ultimately empty. Outer medicine pertains to the corporeal body; inner medicine pertains to the Dharma-body. Outer medicine is the Way of earthly immortals; inner medicine is the Way of water immortals. The perfection of both medicines is the Way of celestial immortals.\n\nOuter medicine completes destiny; inner medicine completes nature. The perfection of both medicines unites form and spirit in wondrous harmony.\n\n**Outer Medicine**\n- *First Pass*: Refining essence into qi—first, one must recognize *tiankui* (heavenly water) and swiftly gather it when it arises.\n- *Middle Pass*: Refining qi into spirit—harmonizing true breath, circulating through the six voids, reversing the flow from the *Taixuan* Pass to the *Tiangu* Cavity for union, then descending to the Yellow Chamber, entering the Central Palace. When *Qian* and *Kun* unite in *Gou*, a single drop falls into the Yellow Court.\n- *Upper Pass*: Refining spirit to return to emptiness—using the mind to refine thoughts is called the *Seven Returns*; emotions returning to nature is called the *Nine Returns*. Returning to nature is the *Nine Returns*.\n\n**Inner Medicine**\nInner medicine is the essence of refining spirit—uniting form and spirit in wondrous harmony to merge with the Dao. Inner medicine is the primordial, singular true yang, like the central line in the *Qian* hexagram, which, when united with *Kun*, becomes the *Kan* Water. This central line is originally *Qian* metal, also called \"metal within water,\" collectively named *zhi jing* (supreme essence). When this supreme essence solidifies, it reverts to the ancestral qi—the primordial, formless, true unity of original qi, not the qi of breath. As the central line of *Qian* unites with *Kun* to form *Kan*, the central yin of *Kun* enters *Qian* to form *Li*. The central yin of *Li* is originally *Kun* earth, hence called \"mercury within cinnabar.\"\n\nThe Dao gives birth to the One; the One gives birth to the Two; the Two gives birth to the Three; the Three gives birth to the myriad things.\nEmptiness transforms into spirit; spirit transforms into qi; qi transforms into essence; essence transforms into form.\nThe above is called the *sequential* process.\n\nThings contain the Three; the Three return to the Two; the Two return to the One.\nMyriad refinements perfect the supreme essence; essence transforms into qi; qi transforms into spirit.\nThe above is called the *reversal* process.\nThe *Scripture of the Elixir* states: \"Following the sequence, one becomes human; reversing it, one becomes the Elixir.\"\n\nThe three treasures—essence, qi, and spirit—are one in substance but two in function. What is substance? The great matter of the original Three Primes. What is function? The dual operations of inner and outer medicines.\n\n**Inner Medicine**\nPrimordial supreme essence, formless empty qi, indestructible original spirit.\n\n**Outer Medicine**\nInteractive essence, breath of inhalation and exhalation, contemplative spirit.\n\n- *First Refinement*: Essence transforms into qi—*First Pass*—deliberate action—extracting from *Kan* to fill *Li*.\n- *Second Refinement*: Qi transforms into spirit—*Middle Pass*—union of being and non-being—*Qian* and *Kun* opening and closing.\n- *Third Refinement*: Spirit returns to emptiness—*Upper Pass*—non-action.",

      "translated_text": "These three stages of practice, when mastered, become one. If one possesses the single eye to perceive this, the great matters of the Three Teachings are complete. Should this not yet be so, study the following details carefully.\n\n**First Refinement: Essence Transforms into Qi**\nReturning to the Dao, one seeks the mysterious in the Water Palace.\nThe *Elixir Scriptures* state: *\"When *gui* arises, swiftly gather it—gazing afar, it cannot be tasted.\"*\nWhat is meant by \"gathering\"? It is the gathering that is no-gathering, called gathering.\nIf one truly gathers something, how can the single line within *Kan* ascend?\nEssence is the transformation of the primordial supreme numen; through movement, the body comes to be.\nThe supreme essence within the body is original yang—this is what one gathers.\nFor example, *Qian* is the primordial supreme numen; at its first movement, it joins with *Kun* to form *Kan*, which is the image of the supreme numen transforming into original essence.\n*Kan* is Water, and the single line within *Kan* is the original *Qian* Metal, provisionally called \"Metal within Water.\"\nMetal is the mother of Water, yet it resides within Water—thus it is said, \"the mother conceals the child’s embryo.\"\nThe subtle signs of gathering Lead cannot be described in words.\nThose who understand may observe the thunder within the earth, the return of the former kings, the closing of passes at the solstice when merchants and travelers cease, and the saying *\"the latter does not consider direction\"*—pondering these, one grasps more than half. The rest remains oral transmission.\n\n**Second Refinement: Qi Transforms into Spirit**\nIn the tradition of Śākya, this is cultivating samādhi in the *Li* Palace.\nThe *Elixir Scriptures* state: *\"True Earth restrains True Lead; True Lead restrains True Mercury. Lead and Mercury return to the Earth Cauldron—body and mind motionless, undisturbed.\"*\nThese words say all.\nOnce True Lead is obtained, what concern remains for True Mercury?\nThe essence of refining qi lies in movement: opening and closing, going and coming, ascending and descending—without cease.\nAt first, one employs intention; later, it becomes natural.\nEach inhalation and exhalation seizes a year’s creative power.\nThis is what the *Daodejing* means by: *\"The gate of the Mysterious Female is called the root of Heaven and Earth. Subtle and continuous, it seems to endure; its use is inexhaustible.\"*\nThose who understand may focus on the gate of *Qian* and *Kun* in the *Book of Changes*, and within *Fu* and *Gou*—here lies the essence of refining qi.\n\n**Third Refinement: Spirit Returns to Emptiness**\nAt this stage of practice, not a single word is needed.\nThe *Compass of the Three and Five* and the verses of Immortal Ziyang’s *Awakening to Reality* state:\n*\"Three, five, and one—just these three characters;\nThrough the ages, those who truly understand are rare.\nEast’s three and South’s two together make five;\nNorth’s one and West’s four share the same.\n*Wu* and *Ji* return to the generative number five;\nThe three families meet to form the infant.\nThe infant is one, containing true qi;\nTen months’ gestation completes the foundation of sagehood.\"*\nThese fifty-six words encompass all the Hundred Schools, the *Elixir Scriptures*, and the books of the Daoist canon.\nIf one possesses the single eye to perceive this, the work of study is complete. Should this not yet be so, consider the annotations below.\n\n*\"Three, five, and one—just these three characters\"*: the Three Primes and Five Phases as one qi.\n*\"Through the ages, those who truly understand are rare\"*: from antiquity to the present, few have known.\n*\"East’s three and South’s two together make five\"*: East’s three is Wood; South’s two is Fire. Wood generates Fire, Wood being Fire’s mother—two natures of one family, thus \"together make five.\"\n*\"North’s one and West’s four share the same\"*: North’s one is Water; West’s four is Metal. Metal generates Water, Metal being Water’s mother—two natures of one family, thus \"share the same.\"\n*\"Wu and Ji return to the generative number five\"*: the generative number of Earth is five. Five stands at the center without a pair, naturally forming one family.\n*\"The three families meet\"*: the Three Primes and Five Phases merge into one.\nThus it is said, *\"The three families meet to form the infant.\"*\nThe so-called infant is a provisional name for the meaning of pure unity—hence, *\"the infant is one, containing true qi.\"*\n*\"Ten months’ gestation completes the foundation of sagehood\"*: three hundred days of gestation, refining the two medicines of eight ounces—cooking, refining, completing, maturing—this is the great work of transcending the ordinary and entering sagehood.\nThus it is said, *\"completes the foundation of sagehood.\"*\nThis is spoken in terms of the individual body.",

      "translated_text": "The Mysterious Pass—a single aperture—is the most profound and essential mechanism. It is not the glabella, nor the fontanel, nor the navel, nor the bladder, nor the two kidneys, nor the space before the kidneys and behind the navel, nor the midpoint between the two kidneys. From the crown of the head to the heels of the feet, throughout the four great elements of the body, if one clings to any single location, one has already missed it. Yet one cannot depart from this body to seek it externally. Thus, the sages have simply pointed to the character *\"middle\"* to reveal it—this *\"middle\"* is precisely it.\n\nLet me offer a metaphor to make this easier to grasp. Consider a marionette: its hands and feet move, its hundred gestures shift—yet the marionette does not move itself; it is the strings that pull it. Though the strings are the mechanism, it is the puppeteer who controls them. Ah! Do you recognize this puppeteer? Cease your doubts, and I will tell you plainly: the marionette is this body; the strings are the Mysterious Pass; the puppeteer is the Master Within. The body’s hands and feet do not move of their own accord—it is the Mysterious Pass that sets them in motion. Yet though the Mysterious Pass moves, it is the Master Within who commands it. If you can recognize this moving mechanism, how could you fail to attain immortality?\n\n**Touchstone of Truth**\n\nThe Golden Elixir takes emptiness as its essence and clarity as its function—it is the supreme, most authentic, and wondrous Dao. Few in the world know it; fewer still practice it. Thus, the sages, in their compassionate power, opened the gate of skillful means, established names and forms, and inscribed them in the alchemical texts to guide later learners. Their intent was that those who come after might recite the words, illuminate the principles, silently comprehend the subtle currents, and thereby practice to swiftly ascend to the true realm. Yet later learners, failing to fathom these principles, cling to mere expedients, recklessly invoking a hundred interpretations, splintering the teachings into myriad fragments.

      "translated_text": "**The Three Gradual Methods and the Three Vehicles**\n\nThe Three Gradual Methods comprise the Three Vehicles. The Supreme Vehicle is the peerless, most true, and wondrous Dao. The Nine Grades of Heterodox Practices are as follows:\n\n**Lower Three Grades**\nThe lowest of the lower grades includes: \"controlling women\" in the bedchamber, the Three Peaks and battle tactics, consuming breast milk before the furnace, using women as crucibles, menstrual blood as medicine, the birth canal as the place of bodily generation, and essence-blood as the great elixir’s foundation. Forging yin-yang swords, establishing the yin-intestine furnace, claiming women to be pure yang, and pointing to menstrual blood as the supreme treasure—ingesting it to achieve monthly restoration, employing nine women as nine crucibles, and pursuing nine years of ninefold refinement. Commanding boys and girls to copulate to gather their initial essence, extracting millet-like grains from the yin as the mysterious pearl. Then there are the \"golden flower,\" the \"golden spear,\" the seventy-two schools of fierce battle and victory, \"more in, less out,\" and \"nine shallow, one deep.\" Such perverse absurdities are called the \"mud-water elixir methods,\" numbering over three hundred. These are the most chaotic of paths, the lowest of the lower grades—utterly heterodox.\n\nFurther, there are eighty-four methods of \"joining,\" thirty-six kinds of \"yin extraction,\" using the placenta as the \"purple river chariot,\" refining urine into \"autumn stone,\" consuming one’s own essence for \"returning to the origin,\" and pinching the coccyx to \"seal the pass.\" Husband and wife copulate without emission, claiming it as \"non-leakage.\" Extracting women’s menstrual blood to make \"red pills,\" or refining the five metals and eight minerals into pellets for women to ingest, producing flesh-masses after ten months as the supreme medicine—consuming these. Such false arts, too numerous to list entirely, number over three hundred and belong to the middle of the lower grades—external heterodoxy.\n\nThen there are the various grades of elixir furnaces and fires, heating the five metals and eight minerals, manipulating mercury with lead, \"pointing to the thatch\" and \"burning the mountain,\" stirring ashes and tending flames. As for external medicines like \"spirit cinnabar,\" the \"three submissions\" and \"five counterfeits,\" and the methods of ingesting metals, minerals, herbs, and woods—over four hundred in total—these belong to the highest of the lower grades, yet remain external heterodoxy.\n\nThe lower three grades together comprise over a thousand methods, practiced by those greedy for lust and profit.\n\n**Middle Three Grades**\nThe lowest of the middle grades includes: fasting to avoid grain, enduring cold and consuming filth, ingesting pepper and wood, sunning the back and lying on ice, observing daily fasts, or adopting peculiar diets—some as \"pure fasts,\" others with bizarre foods, drinking without intoxication as proof, reducing food for \"withdrawal and replenishment,\" avoiding the five flavors for the \"three whites,\" or eschewing cooked food entirely. Some drink wine and eat meat without harming life, calling it \"non-action,\" or perform outlandish feats like \"overturning seas.\" These belong to the lowest of the middle grades.\n\nSwallowing mist and absorbing qi, gathering the essence of the sun and moon, ingesting the light of stars and the qi of the five directions, or drawing the qi of water and fire. Some engage in visualization and contemplation, roaming the nine provinces as practice, or imagine the two qi within the body transforming into a man and woman, mimicking human coupling for harmony. All such visualizations and vain methods belong to the middle of the middle grades.\n\nTransmitting the Three Refuges and Five Precepts, reciting and practicing scriptures, propagating faith to seek karmic rewards, undertaking pilgrimages, pursuing the \"ten faiths\" of emptiness, the \"three intervals\" and \"nine connections,\" worshipping stars and bowing to the Dipper. Some maintain silence, perform labor, or uphold external disciplines. All these are \"with effort\" and belong to the highest of the middle grades, gradually approaching the Dao.\n\nThe middle three grades together number over a thousand methods. Practiced diligently, they lead to gradual improvement, surpassing those who merely dabble.\n\n**Upper Three Grades**\nThe lowest of the upper grades includes: stabilizing observation and inspecting form, visualization and breath regulation, rubbing and adjusting. The \"Eight Brocades,\" the \"Six Healing Sounds,\" gazing at the crown, guarding the navel’s root, swallowing saliva, stirring divine water. Some chew wood a thousand times to enliven, or point to the tongue as the \"crimson dragon,\" rubbing the body to generate heat as \"fire timing,\" or exhaling once and massaging nine times to seek longevity. Some refine thick saliva into the \"true seed,\" guard the elixir field, or lift the external kidneys. Even \"boiling the sea\" and observing the nose, using saliva, essence, and spittle as medicine—these belong to the lowest of the upper grades.\n\nHolding breath and circulating qi, bending and stretching to guide, massaging the waist and kidneys, guarding the glabella, moving the eyes, swaying the spine, and revolving the navel wheel. Some take the eyes as the sun and moon, the space between the brows as the \"mysterious pass,\" or knock teeth as the \"heavenly gate.\" Some imagine the primordial spirit exiting and entering the crown, dream of wandering immortal realms, silently pay homage to the Emperor Above, mistake drowsiness for \"entering samadhi,\" count breaths as \"fire timing,\" or visualize the heart and kidneys as black and white qi merging for \"completion.\" These belong to the middle of the upper grades.\n\nRefining essence and circulating qi, gathering the three fires to the navel, harmonizing the five viscera, the sixteen visualization methods, securing the elixir field, ingesting the \"central yellow qi,\" returning the three fields, replenishing the brain and restoring essence, lifting the \"golden well\" twice, the \"double passes\" of the spine, grasping firmly and inward gazing—various refinements and circulations belong to the highest of the upper grades.\n\nThe upper three grades together number over a thousand methods. Practiced by those of middling capacity, they may also prevent illness.\n\n**The Three Gradual Methods and the Three Vehicles**\nThe Lower Vehicle takes the body and mind as the crucible and furnace, essence and qi as the medicinal ingredients, the heart and kidneys as water and fire, the five viscera as the five phases, the liver and lungs as the dragon and tiger, and essence as the true seed. The years, months, days, and hours serve as the fire timing, swallowing saliva for irrigation as \"bathing,\" the mouth and nose as the \"three essentials,\" the space before the kidneys and behind the navel as the \"mysterious pass,\" and the fusion of the five phases as the \"elixir’s completion.\" This is the method of ease and joy, comprising over a hundred practices. If one can forget passion, it may also nourish life. Though similar to the upper three grades, its applications differ.\n\nThe Middle Vehicle takes heaven and earth as the crucible and vessel, kan and li as water and fire, the crow and hare as the medicinal ingredients, spirit, essence, soul, and intention as the five phases, body and mind as the dragon and tiger, and qi as the true seed. The cold and heat of a year serve as the fire timing, dharma-water for irrigation as \"bathing,\" the inner realm not leaking outward and the outer realm not entering as \"sealing,\" the \"great abyss,\" \"crimson palace,\" and \"essence chamber\" as the \"three essentials,\" the \"mud pill\" as the \"mysterious pass,\" and the fusion of spirit and essence as the \"elixir’s completion.\"",

      "translated_text": "**By Li Daochun Yuan-su of Dulian Qing’an Yingchan, Compiled by Disciple Sun’an Baochan Cai Zhiyi**\n\n**Dialogue Records**\n\n**Jie’an Qiongchan Zi Cheng Andao asked about the Dao of the Three Teachings as One**\n\nYingchan Zi was in quiet sitting within the Toad Grotto. That night, the cold light was pure, and the qi was truly limpid enough to scoop.\n\nThe disciple Qiongchan Zi, deeply pondering the great matter of life and death, revered the immortals and could not but aspire to them, and could not but devote himself to cultivation. Bowing his head, he asked: \"Your disciple has often heard that since ancient times, the supreme sages and lofty perfected ones, as well as the immortals of past dynasties, all attained the Dao through cultivating the real. They necessarily took lead and mercury as the root and stem of the golden elixir. But what are lead and mercury?\"\n\nThe Master said: \"Lead and mercury are the beginning of Heaven and Earth, the mother of the myriad things, and the foundation of the golden elixir. They are not common lead, black tin, quicksilver, or cinnabar. Alas! Those who err do not know the true mystery. They privately conjecture and mislead later learners, wasting years and delaying their entire lives—how pitiable! If they do not encounter a true teacher’s illumination, all their efforts are in vain. The Perfected One of Purple Yang said: *Though your wisdom surpasses Yan and Min, without a true teacher, do not rashly guess.* This is precisely what he meant. Now I will point it out for you: true lead and true mercury are none other than body and heart. The sagely teacher said: *The two words ‘body’ and ‘heart’—they are the medicine, they are the fire.* He also said: *To know where the medicine is produced, only in the southwest is the homeland.* The southwest is Kun. Kun pertains to the body, and the essence within the body is the yang within yin. Like the single yang line of Qian entering Kun to form Kan, outwardly yin yet inwardly yang, outwardly soft yet inwardly firm, outwardly Kun yet inwardly Qian—within Kan Water there is Qian Metal, so it is forcibly named *metal within water*. Mercury is the qi within the heart, the yin within yang. Like the single yin line of Kun entering Qian to form Li, outwardly yang yet inwardly yin, outwardly firm yet inwardly soft, outwardly Qian yet inwardly Kun—within Li Fire there is Kun Earth, so it is forcibly named *mercury within cinnabar*. The wondrous resonance of essence and qi is thus forcibly named and symbolized as lead and mercury, so that learners may know there is substance and function. Pursuing this further, nothing lies beyond the two words ‘body’ and ‘heart.’ After body and heart unite as one, lead and mercury both cease to be.\n\n**Question:** What is *drawing out and adding in*?\n**Answer:** When the body does not move and qi is stabilized, this is called *drawing out*. When the heart does not move and spirit is stabilized, this is called *adding in*. When body and heart do not move, spirit congeals and qi coalesces—this is called *returning to the origin*. Thus, taking the yang from Kan to supplement the yin in Li and form Qian is called *drawing out lead and adding in mercury*.\n\n**Question:** What is *simmering and refining*?\n**Answer:** When body and heart are on the verge of uniting yet have not united, if even the slightest disturbance arises, one counters it with a resolute heart—this is *martial refining*. After body and heart have united and essence and qi have merged, one guards it with a gentle and harmonious heart—this is *civil simmering*. There is no other principle here; simply subduing body and heart is *simmering lead and refining mercury*. Forgetting emotions to nurture nature, emptying the heart to nourish spirit, all conditions suddenly ceasing, all thoughts completely clarified, body and heart unmoving, spirit congealed and qi coalesced—this is called the *foundation of the elixir*, metaphorically termed the *sacred embryo*. All these various names merely describe gathering emotions into nature. When nature is quiescent and emotions are stilled, one illumines the original self, embraces the root and returns to emptiness, and restores the mandate—this is called *elixir completion*, metaphorically termed *rebirth*.\n\n**Question:** The various elixir classics say that the subtlety of cultivation lies in the *mysterious pass*. But where exactly is the mysterious pass?\n**Answer:** The mysterious pass is the most profound and wondrous mechanism. How could it have a fixed location? If you fixate on the body, it is not so; if you seek it outside this body, it is also not so. Clinging to the body is attachment to form; clinging to externals is attachment to things. The mysterious pass is simply where the four great elements and five phases do not adhere. Now I will set forth a metaphor to make it easier for you to understand. Consider a marionette: its hands and feet move, performing all manner of dances, yet it all depends on the strings and pulleys, truly controlled by the master. The marionette is like the four great elements constituting the human body; the strings are like the mysterious pass; the master pulling the strings is like the original true nature. Without strings, the marionette cannot move; without the mysterious pass, a person also cannot move. You must simply, in the twelve double-hours of the day, whether walking, standing, sitting, or lying down, apply effort inwardly and seek it: in speech or silence, seeing or hearing—what is it? When body and heart are tranquil and settled, in the moment of true mechanism and wondrous response, you will naturally perceive it. The *Appended Judgments* of the *Book of Changes* says: *Quiescent and unmoving*—this is the substance of the mysterious pass. *Stimulated, then penetrating*—this is the function of the mysterious pass. Once you perceive the mysterious pass, having attained it once, medicine, fire times, the three origins, and the eight trigrams are all within it. If people fixate on a physical location for the mysterious pass, even if they exert effort and endure hardship, their endeavor will ultimately fail. If I were to directly point it out, I fear you would not grasp it, nor could you use it. You must perceive it yourself. It is like the precelestial learning of the Confucians, which also requires silent recognition. Mencius said: *The vast qi fills the space between Heaven and Earth*—he called it *hard to describe*. Is not the subtlety of what is hard to describe the mysterious pass? Moreover, like the Buddhists who do not rely on written words, transmitting beyond the teachings, enabling people to apprehend it with spirit and understand it with intention—this is called the *wondrousness of what is not transmitted*. One who knows this principle can then achieve unity that penetrates all things.\n\n**Question:** Some say that revering Buddhism and cultivating the Dao can sever life and death and escape the wheel of rebirth, while studying Confucianism can fulfill human relationships but cannot resolve life and death. Is this not a difference among the Three Teachings?",

      "original_text": "曰：达理者奚患生死耶？ 且如穷理尽性，以至於命； 原始返终，知周万物，则知生死之说。 所以性命之学，实儒家正传。 穷得理彻，了然自知，岂可不能断生死输回乎？ 且如羲皇初画易之时，体天设教，以道化人，未尝有三教之分。 故曰皇天无二道，圣人无两心。 当来初画一者，象太极也。 有一便有二，象两仪也。 一者阳也，一者阴也，一阴一阳之谓道。 仰则观於天上，画一画以象 天； 俯则察於地下，画一画以象地； 中画一画以象人。 故三画以成乾 ，象三才也。 两乾断而成坤 ，象六合也。 故曰：立天之道曰阴与阳二立地之道曰柔与刚，立人之道曰仁与义。 兼三才而两之，故六画而成坤。 以一身言之，立天之道曰阴与阳，心之一神气也； 立地之道曰柔与刚，身之形体也； 立人之道曰仁与义，意之情性也？ 心、身、意，象乾三才也； 神气、性情、形体，象坤之六合也。 《易》曰：远取诸物，近取诸身。 此之谓也。 问：《系辞》云六画而成卦，先生云六画而成坤者，何也？ 曰：汝未知之，若谓六画而成卦者，文王重卦也。 文王未重卦之前，岂可谓无三才六合乎？ 先贤云立天之道曰阴与阳，天之乾坤也； 立地之道曰柔与刚，地之乾坤也。 立人之道曰仁与义，人之乾坤也。 以此推之，乾坤两卦，三才六合备矣，又岂以重卦言之哉？ 所谓六画而成卦者，重卦之后，名为后天〔卦〕也。 问：若谓未重卦之前，三才六合备矣。 而《系辞》云：以制器者尚其象。 未必因器而设象，因象而制器乎？ 曰：因象而制器。 问：三皇以下，圣人制器皆以重卦言之。 若谓因象制器，文王未重易之前，岂有重卦之名乎？ 曰：非也。 前贤云：须信画前元有易。 所以文王未重卦之前，六十四卦俱备。 问：卦若不重，六十四卦从何而得？ 曰：变卦所生也。 一卦变八卦，八卦变六十四卦。 且如乾卦三爻，上两爻少阳，下一爻老阳，支出巽卦来，阳变为阴，乾之巽，天风姤也。 举此一卦，诸卦皆然。 问：卦不重而有六十四卦，文王如何又重之？ 曰：卦不重而变六十四卦，乃羲皇心法，道统正传，诱万世之下学者，同入圣门。 重卦而生六十四卦者，乃文王、周孔立民极，正人伦，使世人趋吉避凶，立万世君臣父子之纲耳。 故性命之学，不敢轻明於言，亦不忍隐斯道。 孔子微露於《系辞》，濂溪发明於《太极通书》也。 盖欲来者熟咀之，而自得之，此学不泯其传矣。 问：一阴一阳之谓道，如何说？ 曰：阴阳者，乾坤也。 乾坤出於太极，太极判而两仪立焉。 两仪，天地也。 不言天地，而言乾坤者，贵其用不贵其体也。 或曰：乾阳也，坤阴也，如何又云天地？ 曰：天地即乾坤也，乾坤即阴阳也，阴阳一太极也，太极本无极也。 以太极言之，则曰天地； 以易言之，则曰乾坤； 以道言之，则曰阴阳。 若以人身言之，天地形体也，乾坤性情也，阴阳神气也。 以法象言之，天龙地虎也，乾马坤牛也，阳乌阴兔也，以金丹言之，天鼎地炉也，乾金坤土也，阴汞阳铅也。 散而言之，种种异名，合而言之，一阴一阳也。 修仙之人，炼铅汞而成丹者，即身心合而还其本初，阴阳合而复归太极也。 问：三五一，是何也？ 曰：三元五行也。 东三南二是一个五，北一西四是两个五，中土是三个五，是谓三五也。",
      "translated_text": "He replied: How can one who grasps the principle be troubled by life and death? Consider this: exhausting principle and fully realizing one’s nature to the utmost of destiny; tracing origins to return to endings, comprehending all things in their entirety—then one understands the discourse on life and death. Thus, the learning of nature and destiny is truly the orthodox transmission of Confucianism. If one thoroughly penetrates principle and attains clear understanding, how could one fail to sever life and death and escape the wheel of rebirth?\n\nMoreover, when Fuxi first drew the *Yi*, he embodied Heaven to establish teachings and transformed people through the Dao—there was no division among the Three Teachings. As it is said: *August Heaven has no second Dao; the sage has no dual heart.* When he first drew the single line, it symbolized the Supreme Ultimate. With one came two, symbolizing the Two Modes. One is yang, the other yin—*the alternation of yin and yang is called the Dao.* Looking up, he observed the heavens and drew a line to symbolize Heaven; looking down, he examined the earth and drew a line to symbolize Earth; in the middle, he drew a line to symbolize Man. Thus, three lines form *Qian*, symbolizing the Three Powers. Two *Qian* broken form *Kun*, symbolizing the Six Directions. Hence it is said: *The Dao of Heaven is established as yin and yang; the Dao of Earth is established as soft and hard; the Dao of Man is established as benevolence and righteousness.* Combining the Three Powers and doubling them, six lines form *Kun*.\n\nSpeaking of the human body: the Dao of Heaven is established as yin and yang—this is the single spirit and qi of the heart; the Dao of Earth is established as soft and hard—this is the physical form of the body; the Dao of Man is established as benevolence and righteousness—this is the emotions and nature of the mind. Heart, body, and mind symbolize the Three Powers of *Qian*; spirit, qi, nature, emotions, and physical form symbolize the Six Directions of *Kun*. The *Yi* says: *Far-off, one takes from things; near, one takes from oneself.* This is what it means.\n\nSomeone asked: The *Xici* says *six lines form a hexagram*—why do you say *six lines form Kun*?\n\nHe replied: You do not yet understand. When it speaks of six lines forming a hexagram, it refers to King Wen’s doubling of the trigrams. Before King Wen doubled the trigrams, how could there be no Three Powers and Six Directions? The former worthies said: *The Dao of Heaven is established as yin and yang—this is Heaven’s Qian and Kun; the Dao of Earth is established as soft and hard—this is Earth’s Qian and Kun; the Dao of Man is established as benevolence and righteousness—this is Man’s Qian and Kun.* Extending this reasoning, the two hexagrams *Qian* and *Kun* encompass the Three Powers and Six Directions—how could this be explained by the doubling of trigrams? What is called *six lines form a hexagram* refers to the post-heaven hexagrams after the doubling.\n\nSomeone asked: If the Three Powers and Six Directions were already complete before the doubling of trigrams, then the *Xici* says: *Those who created implements esteemed their images.* Was it not that implements were made according to images, and images were established to create implements?\n\nHe replied: Implements were made according to images.\n\nSomeone asked: From the Three Sovereigns onward, sages created implements all based on the doubled hexagrams. If implements were made according to images, how could there be a name for doubled hexagrams before King Wen doubled the *Yi*?\n\nHe replied: Not so. The former worthies said: *You must believe that before the lines were drawn, the Yi already existed.* Thus, before King Wen doubled the trigrams, all sixty-four hexagrams were complete.\n\nSomeone asked: If hexagrams were not doubled, how could the sixty-four hexagrams be obtained?\n\nHe replied: They arise from the transformation of hexagrams. One hexagram transforms into eight, and eight transform into sixty-four. For example, in the *Qian* hexagram’s three lines, the upper two are young yang, and the lower one is old yang. Extending this, the *Xun* hexagram emerges—yang transforms into yin, *Qian*’s *Xun*, *Heaven-Wind Gou*. Taking this one hexagram as an example, all hexagrams follow the same pattern.\n\nSomeone asked: If hexagrams were not doubled yet still produced sixty-four hexagrams, why did King Wen double them?\n\nHe replied: The sixty-four hexagrams arising from undoubled hexagrams were Fuxi’s heart-method, the orthodox transmission of the Dao lineage, guiding learners of later generations to enter the gate of sages together. The sixty-four hexagrams arising from doubled hexagrams were established by King Wen and the Zhou Confucians to set the standard for the people, rectify human relationships, enable people to pursue good fortune and avoid misfortune, and establish the eternal norms of ruler and minister, father and son. Thus, the learning of nature and destiny dare not be lightly expounded in words, nor can one bear to conceal this Dao. Confucius subtly revealed it in the *Xici*, and Master Zhou Dunyi elucidated it in the *Taiji Tushuo*. This is to allow later learners to thoroughly chew and digest it, attaining understanding on their own—thus this learning will not perish in transmission.\n\nSomeone asked: What does *the alternation of yin and yang is called the Dao* mean?\n\nHe replied: Yin and yang are *Qian* and *Kun*. *Qian* and *Kun* emerge from the Supreme Ultimate. The Supreme Ultimate divides, and the Two Modes are established. The Two Modes are Heaven and Earth. It does not speak of Heaven and Earth but of *Qian* and *Kun* because it values their function over their substance.\n\nSomeone asked: *Qian* is yang, *Kun* is yin—why then say Heaven and Earth?\n\nHe replied: Heaven and Earth are *Qian* and *Kun*; *Qian* and *Kun* are yin and yang; yin and yang are one Supreme Ultimate; the Supreme Ultimate is originally the Ultimateless. Speaking in terms of the Supreme Ultimate, it is called Heaven and Earth; speaking in terms of the *Yi*, it is called *Qian* and *Kun*; speaking in terms of the Dao, it is called yin and yang. Speaking of the human body: Heaven and Earth are the physical form; *Qian* and *Kun* are nature and emotions; yin and yang are spirit and qi. Speaking in terms of symbolic correspondences: Heaven is the dragon, Earth the tiger; *Qian* the horse, *Kun* the ox; yang the crow, yin the hare. Speaking in terms of the Golden Elixir: Heaven is the cauldron, Earth the furnace; *Qian* is metal, *Kun* is earth; yin is mercury, yang is lead. Spoken of separately, they have various names; spoken of together, they are the alternation of yin and yang. Those who cultivate immortality and refine lead and mercury into the elixir are uniting body and mind to return to their original state, merging yin and yang to revert to the Supreme Ultimate.\n\nSomeone asked: What is *three-five-one*?\n\nHe replied: The Three Origins and Five Phases. East three and south two form one five; north one and west four form two fives; central earth is three fives—this is called *three-five.*",

One who knows this principle can then achieve unity that penetrates all things.\n\n**Question:** Some say that revering Buddhism and cultivating the Dao can sever life and death and escape the wheel of rebirth, while studying Confucianism can fulfill human relationships but cannot resolve life and death.

      "original_text": "以人身言之，性三神二是一个五，情四精一是两个五，意五是三个五也。 三五合一，则归太极； 身心意合一，则成圣胎也。 紫阳真人云：三五一都三个字，三元五行一气是也。 古今明者实然稀。 世鲜知之。 东三南二同成五，东三性也，南二神也。 北一西四方共之。 北一精也，西四情也。 戊己还从生数五，土数五，意也。 三家相见结婴儿。 三家者身心意也，婴儿者三五合一而成用也。 婴儿是一含真气，婴儿是真一之异名，太一含真也。 十月胎圆入圣基。 工夫十月，脱出凡胎，超凡入圣也。 以此求之，金丹之道，实入圣基也。 问：《系辞》云天地设位，易行乎中。 如何？ 曰：天地设位人生於中，是谓三才，故人与物生生而不息。 所以不言人与物，而言易者，圣人言乾坤易之门，随时变易，以从道也。 如金丹以乾坤为鼎器者，天地设位也。 以阴阳为化机者，即易行乎中也。 元始采药无穷，行火候之不息也。 问：辟户谓之乾，阖户谓之坤，一阖一辟谓之变。 如何？ 曰：一阖一辟者，一动一静也。 乾阳坤阴，如门户之阖辟，即乾坤易之门也。 且如阴阳互动互静，机缄不已，元亨利贞，定四时，成岁变者，变易也。 至道与神气，混混沦沦，周乎三才万物，阖辟无穷，致广大而尽精微矣。 以一身言之，呼吸是矣。 呼则接天根，是谓之辟； 吸则接地根，是谓之阖。 一呼一吸，化生金液，是谓之变。 阖辟呼吸，即玄牝之门，天地之根矣。 所谓呼吸者，非口鼻呼吸，乃真息阖辟也。 问：乾道成男，坤道成女。 如何？ 曰：乾，父也，坤，母也。 乾初爻交坤而成震，震初索而得男，是谓长男。 坤初爻交乾而成巽，巽初索而得女，是谓〔长〕女。 乾中爻交坤而成坎，坎再索而得男，是谓中男。 坤中爻交乾而成离，离再索而得女，是谓中女。 乾三爻交坤而成艮，艮三索而得男，是谓少男。 坤三爻交乾而成兑，兑三索而得女，是谓少女。 乾生三男，坤生三女，乾坤共生六子，是谓八卦。 以身言之，初受胎时，禀父母精华而成此身。 精华者，丹经喻曰天壬地癸也。 初交合时，天壬先至，地癸随至，癸裹壬则成男子； 地癸先至，天壬随至，壬裹癸则成女子。 壬癸偶然齐至，则成双胎。 壬先至癸迟至，癸先至壬迟至，俱不成胎也。 故曰：乾道成男，坤道成女。 夫天壬地癸者，乃天地元精元气也。 亦丹经所云坎戊离己，异名铅汞也。 节之於外则成人，益之於内则成丹。 世人不知生男生女，实由命分中得，不由人力。 若不断淫绝欲，自为修养，直待精华耗谒，早至夭亡，大可惜也。 又岂知寡欲而得男女，贵而寿； 多欲而得男女，浊而夭。 问：形而上者谓之道，形而下者谓之器。 如何？ 曰：形而上者无形质，形而下者有体用。 无形质者，系乎性汞也。 有体用者，系乎命铅也。 总而言之，无出身心也。 问：圣人以易洗心，退藏於密，密是何也？ 曰：诚之至也。 易理致广大而尽精微，圣人玩味其理，洗心涤虑，藏於极诚矣。 问：《书》云人心惟危，道心惟微，惟精惟一，允执厥中。 不知中如何执？ 曰：执者，一定之辞。 中者，正之中也。 道心微而难见，人心危而不安，虽至人亦有人心，虽下愚亦有道心。 苟能心常正得中，所以微妙而难见也。",
      "translated_text": "Speaking in terms of the human body: nature as three and spirit as two form one five; emotion as four and essence as one form two fives; intent as five is three fives. When the three fives unite as one, they return to the Supreme Ultimate; when body, mind, and intent merge as one, the sacred embryo is formed. The Perfected One of Purple Yang said: *\"Three-five-one\"* are but three words—it is the Three Origins, Five Phases, and unified qi. From ancient times to now, those who truly understand this are rare. The world seldom knows it. East three and south two together form five: east three is nature, south two is spirit. North one and west four share the same principle: north one is essence, west four is emotion. *Wu* and *ji* return to the generative number five—earth’s number is five, which is intent. When the three families meet, the infant is formed. The three families are body, mind, and intent; the infant is the functional result of the three fives uniting as one. The infant is one that contains true qi; the infant is another name for the True One, the Supreme One containing truth. After ten months, the embryo is complete, and the foundation of sagehood is laid. With ten months of effort, one sheds the mortal embryo and transcends the ordinary to enter sagehood. Pursuing the Way of the Golden Elixir in this manner truly establishes the foundation of sagehood.\n\nSomeone asked: The *Xici* says, \"Heaven and Earth establish their positions, and the Changes move within them.\" What does this mean?\n\nHe replied: Heaven and Earth establish their positions, and humans are born between them—this is called the Three Powers. Thus, humans and all things are born and ceaselessly transform. It does not speak of humans and things but of the *Changes* because the sage speaks of *Qian* and *Kun* as the gate of the *Changes*, adapting to the Dao through constant transformation. In the Golden Elixir, taking *Qian* and *Kun* as the cauldron and vessel is like Heaven and Earth establishing their positions; taking yin and yang as the mechanism of transformation is the *Changes* moving within them. From the beginning, gathering the medicine is inexhaustible, and the fire times proceed without cease.\n\nSomeone asked: Opening the door is called *Qian*, closing the door is called *Kun*, and the alternation of opening and closing is called *change*. What does this mean?\n\nHe replied: The alternation of opening and closing is the alternation of movement and stillness. *Qian* is yang, *Kun* is yin—like the opening and closing of a door, it is the gate of *Qian* and *Kun* in the *Changes*. Moreover, as yin and yang mutually move and rest, their mechanism operates unceasingly. *Yuan*, *heng*, *li*, and *zhen* determine the four seasons and complete the yearly cycle—this is *change* and *ease*. The supreme Dao and spirit-qi blend indistinguishably, pervading the Three Powers and the myriad things. Opening and closing are endless, reaching vastness and exhausting subtlety. Speaking of the human body: breathing is the example. Exhaling connects to the root of Heaven—this is called *opening*; inhaling connects to the root of Earth—this is called *closing*. One exhalation and one inhalation transform and generate the golden liquid—this is called *change*. Opening and closing, exhalation and inhalation, are the gate of the Mysterious Female, the root of Heaven and Earth. The so-called breathing is not the breath of mouth and nose but the true rest of opening and closing.\n\nSomeone asked: *\"The Dao of Qian forms the male; the Dao of Kun forms the female.\"* What does this mean?\n\nHe replied: *Qian* is the father, *Kun* is the mother. The initial yang line of *Qian* interacts with *Kun* to form *Zhen*, and *Zhen*’s first line yields the male—this is called the eldest son. The initial yin line of *Kun* interacts with *Qian* to form *Xun*, and *Xun*’s first line yields the female—this is called the eldest daughter. The middle yang line of *Qian* interacts with *Kun* to form *Kan*, and *Kan*’s second line yields the male—this is called the middle son. The middle yin line of *Kun* interacts with *Qian* to form *Li*, and *Li*’s second line yields the female—this is called the middle daughter. The third yang line of *Qian* interacts with *Kun* to form *Gen*, and *Gen*’s third line yields the male—this is called the youngest son. The third yin line of *Kun* interacts with *Qian* to form *Dui*, and *Dui*’s third line yields the female—this is called the youngest daughter. *Qian* produces three sons, *Kun* produces three daughters, and together *Qian* and *Kun* give birth to six children—these are the eight trigrams.\n\nSpeaking of the body: at the moment of conception, one receives the essence of father and mother to form this body. This essence is metaphorically called *heavenly ren* and *earthly gui* in the elixir classics. At the initial union, if *heavenly ren* arrives first and *earthly gui* follows, *gui* envelops *ren* to form a male; if *earthly gui* arrives first and *heavenly ren* follows, *ren* envelops *gui* to form a female. If *ren* and *gui* arrive simultaneously, a twin birth results. If *ren* arrives first and *gui* is delayed, or *gui* arrives first and *ren* is delayed, conception does not occur. Thus it is said: *\"The Dao of Qian forms the male; the Dao of Kun forms the female.\"* Now, *heavenly ren* and *earthly gui* are the primordial essence and qi of Heaven and Earth. They are also what the elixir classics call *Kan*-*wu* and *Li*-*ji*, alternate names for lead and mercury. When regulated externally, they form a person; when cultivated internally, they form the elixir. The world does not know that whether one has sons or daughters is truly determined by fate and not by human effort. If one does not cut off lust and desires but instead engages in self-cultivation only after essence and vitality are exhausted, one will die young—this is deeply lamentable. How could they know that those who have few desires and bear sons or daughters are noble and long-lived, while those who have many desires and bear sons or daughters are base and short-lived?\n\nSomeone asked: *\"That which is above form is called the Dao; that which is below form is called the vessel.\"* What does this mean?\n\nHe replied: That which is above form has no physical substance; that which is below form has body and function. That without physical substance pertains to nature and mercury; that with body and function pertains to destiny and lead. In sum, they do not go beyond body and mind.\n\nSomeone asked: The sage *\"uses the Changes to wash the mind and retreats to conceal it in secrecy.\"* What is this *secrecy*?\n\nHe replied: It is the utmost sincerity. The principles of the *Changes* reach vastness and exhaust subtlety. The sage savors their meaning, washes the mind and purifies thoughts, concealing them in perfect sincerity.\n\nSomeone asked: The *Book of Documents* says, *\"The human mind is perilous; the Dao-mind is subtle. Only with utmost refinement and singular focus can one truly hold to the center.\"* How does one hold to the *center*?\n\nHe replied: *Hold* is a term of certainty. *Center* is the exact middle. The Dao-mind is subtle and hard to perceive; the human mind is perilous and unstable. Even the most realized person has a human mind, and even the most foolish has a Dao-mind. If one can always keep the mind upright and centered, this subtlety is difficult to perceive.",

This is what is meant by *\"without thought, one attains; without effort, one hits the mark\"*—achieving the Dao of effortless spontaneity. This is what the *Doctrine of the Mean* calls *\"sincerity leading to clarity.\"* To speak of *\"clarity leading to sincerity\"* is precisely the teaching of the sage. Those who study the Dao, if endowed with deep karmic roots, directly comprehend their nature and naturally fulfill their destiny—this is *\"born with knowledge.\"* Those with shallow roots cannot directly grasp their nature; they must be taught and enter through effort, progressing from existence to non-existence, from the coarse to the subtle. Thus, they first fulfill their destiny before comprehending their nature—this is *\"learning to know.\"*\n\nSomeone asked: *The Master ate coarse food, drank plain water, rested his head on his bent arm, yet found joy therein.* Where did the Master’s joy lie?\nHe replied: The Master’s joy was in Heaven, and what he knew was destiny. Thus, he *\"found joy in Heaven and knew destiny, free from care.\"* Even when besieged by the people of Kuang, he still played the zither and sang for his own delight, never far from the *Changes*. Through cultivating the self, he once more perceived the heart of Heaven and Earth, exhausting principle and fulfilling nature to reach destiny—this is the subtlety of the Golden Elixir.\n\nSomeone asked: *How did Yanzi find joy in his simple bamboo bowl and gourd ladle?*\nHe replied: Yanzi grasped the Master’s principle of *\"finding joy in Heaven and knowing destiny, free from care,\"* and thus his joy remained unchanged. His *\"feigned foolishness,\"* his *\"fasting of the mind\"* and *\"sitting in forgetfulness,\"* his *\"dimming of hearing and sight\"* and *\"discarding of wisdom and thought\"*—even in frequent poverty, this too is the subtlety of the Golden Elixir.\n\nSomeone asked: *Zengzi wore tattered hemp robes yet sang with a voice that filled Heaven and Earth, so that even the Son of Heaven could not make him a subject nor the feudal lords befriend him.* How was this so?\nHe replied: Zengzi’s marvel lay in his *\"single affirmation,\"* where both speech and hearing were forgotten. Thus, he mastered the Dao of *\"cultivating the self, ordering the family, governing the state, and pacifying the world\"*—the unifying principle.\n\nSomeone asked: *When Zilu asked about death, the Master replied, \"If you do not yet understand life, how can you understand death?\"* How is this so?\nHe replied: Life and death are as constant as day and night. Knowing day exists, one knows night exists. As the *Changes* says: *\"Tracing beginnings and returning to endings, one understands the discourse on life and death.\"* The *Elixir Scriptures* say: *\"Before father and mother were born, this is the foundation of the Golden Elixir.\"* The Buddhists ask: *\"Before this body existed, where was one’s nature?\"* Seeking thus, the entry points of the Three Teachings converge. One must trace the origin to know the end, follow the stream to know the source. If one thoroughly investigates this body—whence it comes and whither it goes—life and death are naturally understood. Have you studied the *Diagram of the Supreme Ultimate*? What existed before the Supreme Ultimate divided?\n\nSomeone asked: *Before the Supreme Ultimate divided, its form was like an egg. What lay beyond the egg?*\nHe replied: The Great Void. When all people receive qi, their forms are undifferentiated, like an egg. After birth, nature and destiny are established, and all beyond the body is the Great Void.\n\nSomeone asked: *When a person is in the mother’s womb, do they possess nature?*\nHe replied: The womb is filthy and impure—how could the numinous nature abide there?\nFurther asked: *At five or seven months of pregnancy, the fetus suddenly stirs—is this not nature?*\nHe replied: It is not nature, but merely qi. While in the womb, one breathes with the mother; upon leaving, nature and destiny are established, and one possesses their own Heaven and Earth. Consider a snake cut in two: the front still moves, the tail still lives. Or a crab cooked until done, yet a discarded leg still twitches—is this nature? Investigate this principle, and you will know it is qi moving, not nature.\n\nSomeone asked: *The saying goes, \"My Dao is unified by one principle.\"* How is this so?\nHe replied: The sage speaks of the single principle within the body, which can unify the Three Powers, the Three Teachings, and all things. As the Buddhists say, *\"no self, no others, no sentient beings, no lifespan,\"* and the Daoists say, *\"comprehending the ten thousand things is complete\"*—all are unified by one principle.\n\nSomeone asked: *When the World-Honored One held up a flower before the assembly, only Kāśyapa smiled faintly. The World-Honored One said, \"I possess the treasury of the true Dharma-eye, the wondrous mind of nirvana, and now entrust it to Mahākāśyapa.\"* What did his faint smile signify?\nHe replied: When the World-Honored One held up the flower, none in the assembly perceived the Buddha’s mind—only Kāśyapa saw its subtlety and thus smiled. Therefore, the World-Honored One transmitted the wondrous principle beyond the mind to Kāśyapa.\n\nSomeone asked: *Bodhidharma came from the West without relying on written words, directly pointing to the human mind to see nature and attain Buddhahood. What does \"seeing nature\" mean?*\nHe replied: Bodhidharma used the wondrous principle of true emptiness to directly point to the human mind. *\"Seeing nature\"* means turning the emotions of things to emptiness, thereby naturally perceiving one’s nature. How could it depend on transmission through brush and tongue?\n\nSomeone asked: *Confucians have the *Prior Heaven Changes*, Buddhists have the *Prajñā Sūtra*, and Daoists have the *Scripture of Numinous Treasure*—are these not written words?*\nHe replied: No. All are sages expressing the ineffable through words, revealing the Dao of true constancy. The Buddhist canon, with its vast collection of scriptures, records, and discourses on karma; the Confucian Nine Classics, Three Commentaries, and the hundred schools; the Daoist *Cavernous Mystery* scriptures and various elixir texts—these are the pathways to entering the Dao, the ladder to transcendence.",
      "overlap_context": "d is perilous; the Dao-mind is subtle. Only with utmost refinement and singular focus can one truly hold to the center.\"* How does one hold to the *center*?\n\nHe replied: *Hold* is a term of certainty. *Center* is the exact middle. The Dao-mind is subtle and hard to perceive; the human mind is perilous and unstable. Even the most realized person has a human mind, and even the most foolish has a Dao-mind. If one can always keep the mind upright and centered, this subtlety is difficult to perceive.",

      "translated_text": "When one reaches the ultimate state, not even a single word is needed. Your many questions are but a raft for crossing the river. The step beyond lies in seeking beyond words and phrases. If, through stumbling or collision, you awaken and penetrate through, you return to the Great Ultimate—perfectly luminous, aware, and illuminating; empty yet spiritually penetrating; with both nature and life complete, form and spirit equally wondrous; and your body one with the void. To stand shoulder to shoulder with immortals and buddhas is then no difficult feat.\n\nSomeone asked: *You say the three teachings share a single principle—this is most enlightening. Yet Buddhists speak of nirvāṇa, while Daoists speak of \"shedding the mortal coil.\" These seem different.*\nHe replied: *Nirvāṇa and \"shedding the mortal coil\" are but one and the same principle. \"Shedding the mortal coil\" means casting off the ordinary body—is this not nirvāṇa? Just as Daoists refine essence into qi, qi into spirit, and spirit into emptiness—embracing the root and returning to the void—this is identical in principle to the Buddhist return to emptiness, with no difference whatsoever.*\n\nAnother asked: *After shedding the mortal coil, is there still transformation?*\nHe replied: *There is indeed transformation. The sage says: \"A body beyond the body is not yet extraordinary; only when the void is shattered does the full truth appear.\" Thus, after shedding the mortal coil, one must stand firmly on the ground until one’s body becomes one with the void—only then is the task complete. For the Buddha speaks of \"true emptiness,\" the Confucian of \"non-action,\" and the Daoist of \"spontaneity\"—all are embracing the root and returning to the origin, becoming one with the Great Void. How could those who cling to partial truths ever grasp this all-pervading Dao?*\n\nJie’an remarked: *Master, you have attained the wondrous Dao of the Golden Elixir and harmonized the profound mysteries of the three teachings. Your answers to questions are supremely subtle and wondrous. How could I dare keep this secret? I shall have it printed and shared with those of like aspiration to awaken together. Like the Sui pearl and Zhao jade, those with discernment will recognize its worth.*\n\n**Zhao Ding’an’s Questions**\nThe Master said: *The ancestral masters and perfected sages of past ages possessed the supreme, most true Dao, which they transmitted to save people in the world. Do you know of this?*\nDing’an replied: *Your disciple, newly entered into the mysterious gate, is utterly foolish and dull. By your grace in accepting me, I count this the fortune of a thousand lifetimes. Of the supreme, most true Dao, I truly know nothing—pray, Master, enlighten me.*\nThe Master said: *The supreme, most true Dao is that which is beyond all that can be surpassed, the most profound of the profound, without form yet forming all, spontaneously so—this is what is called the ultimate and most wondrous. The sages gave it the forced name of \"Dao.\" Since ancient times, all transcendent immortals have attained realization through this—none have cultivated and verified it by any other means. From mouth to mouth, from heart to heart across the generations, the oral transmission of the Golden Elixir’s essentials is none other than this supreme, most true and wondrous Dao.*\n\nDing’an asked: *The supreme, most true mystery is likened to the Golden Elixir—what is its principle?*\nThe Master said: *\"Gold\" signifies hardness; \"elixir\" signifies roundness. Buddhists liken it to \"perfect enlightenment,\" Confucians to the \"Great Ultimate.\" It is no other thing—only the original, single numinous spirit. The original true nature is indestructible through endless kalpas, like gold in its hardness, like the elixir in its roundness, growing ever brighter with refinement. Buddhists say: \"○ This is true suchness.\" Confucians say: \"○ This is the Great Ultimate.\" Our Dao says: \"○ This is the Golden Elixir.\" The substance is the same; only the names differ.*\n\n*The* Book of Changes *says: \"The Changes have the Great Ultimate, which generates the Two Modes.\" The Great Ultimate is the designation for the spontaneous and formless. The Two Modes are the one yin and one yang. Yin and yang are heaven and earth. Humans are born between heaven and earth—this is called the Three Powers. The Dao of the Three Powers is fully embodied in a single person. The Great Ultimate is the original spirit; the Two Modes are body and mind. In terms of the elixir, the Great Ultimate is the mother of the elixir; the Two Modes are true lead and true mercury. What is called lead and mercury are not mercury, cinnabar, sulfur, black tin, herbs, or trees; nor are they essence, fluids, tears, saliva, heart, kidneys, qi, or blood. They are the original spirit within the body and the original qi within the body. When the body is unmoving, essence and qi congeal—this is likened to the elixir. What is called the elixir is the body. ○ is the true nature. Extracting ○ from the elixir is called \"elixir accomplished.\" The so-called elixir is not fabricated from external things; it is the fulfillment of the original source from which one is born, thereby attaining the most true. Few in the world understand this.*\n\n*Today’s practitioners of the elixir mostly fail to receive the correct transmission. They all seek externally, following the deviant and turning from the orthodox. Thus, many study but few succeed. Some refine the five metals and eight stones; some refine the three evils and five falsities; some refine the qi beyond clouds and mist; some refine the essences of the sun and moon; some gather the light of the stars; some imagine a pellet in the void to form the elixir; some imagine an object in the cinnabar field as the elixir; some fly the golden essence from behind the elbow; some visualize between the eyebrows; some return essence to replenish the brain; some circulate qi to the navel; some ingest filth and swallow essence; some inhale the new and exhale the old; some practice the Eight Brocades or the Six-Character Qi; some shake the spine; some twist the windlass; some close the tailbone; some guard the navel stem; some gather heavenly water; some refine autumn stone; some bend and stretch in daoyin; some stroke and massage to regulate; some silently pay homage to the Supreme Emperor; some press the tongue to the upper palate; some return the three fields; some close the breath and circulate qi; some gather the three fires in the bladder; some drill the five phases in the sea of bitterness. Such minor methods number in the thousands. Even with diligent practice and gathering, they will never accomplish the great task.*\n\n*The scripture says: \"The true Dharma is hard to encounter, and many go astray; the true Dao often enters deviant sects.\" This is what it means. The essentials of the most true are the simplest and easiest—difficult to encounter but easy to accomplish. If one meets a perfected person’s guidance, none fail to succeed.*\n\nDing’an said: *Your disciple, by good fortune from past lives, has met you, Master, and is blessed to receive your nurturing grace. I pray you bestow the essentials of the Golden Elixir and grant me your guidance.*",

      "translated_text": "The Master said: Listen carefully now, and I shall speak to you of these matters. Those who refine the Golden Elixir must wholly seize the creative transformations of Heaven and Earth. They take Qian and Kun as their crucible and vessel, the sun and moon, water and fire, yin and yang as the mechanism of transformation, the hare and the toad as the medicine. Relying on the turning of the Celestial Stem and the revolving of the Dipper’s handle, they gather the medicine at the proper time and move the tally accordingly. Advancing fire and retreating tally follow the seasons of a year; drawing forth lead and adding mercury mirror the waxing and waning of a month. They gather the Five Phases, unite the Four Images, pursue the Two Qi to return them to the Yellow Path, and assemble the Three Essences in the Primordial Palace. Returning to the root and restoring life, when merit is complete and spirit perfected, the mortal sheds its form to become an immortal—this is called the completion of the Elixir.\n\nDing’an said: The creative transformations of Heaven and Earth truly seem difficult to seize.\n\nThe Master said: There is nothing beyond this single body—what difficulty could there be? Heaven and Earth are the bodily form; water and fire are the essence and qi; yin and yang are the body and mind; the hare and toad are the nature and emotions. Thus, the bodily form serves as the crucible and furnace, essence and qi as water and fire, emotions and nature as the mechanism of transformation, and body and mind as the medicinal materials. Fearing that students would have no standard to follow, the sages used Heaven and Earth as analogies. The body and the creative transformations of Heaven and Earth are never separate—these two words, body and mind, are both the medicine and the fire. Thus, the celestial hun and terrestrial po, the Qian horse and Kun ox, the yang lead and yin mercury, the Kan man and Li woman, the sun crow and moon hare—none lie beyond these two words, body and mind.\n\nThe turning of the Celestial Stem is the Celestial Heart. The scripture says: \"Observe the Dao with the heart, and the Dao is the heart; observe the heart with the Dao, and the heart is the Dao.\" The revolving of the Dipper’s handle is the Mysterious Pass. The Mysterious Pass is the most profound and wondrous mechanism. Yet today’s students cling to physical forms: some say it is between the eyebrows, others the navel, still others the space between the two kidneys, or behind the navel and before the kidneys, or the bladder, or the Cinnabar Field. Some say the head has nine palaces, with the Mysterious Pass at the center; others point to the birth gate as the place of bodily origin, or the mouth and nose as the Mysterious Female—all are mistaken. To fixate on physical form is entirely wrong. Yet one cannot abandon this body to seek it elsewhere. Why do none of the various elixir scriptures specify its location? It is difficult to describe in words or brushstrokes, hence it is called the Mysterious Pass. Thus, the sages inscribed only a single character, \"center,\" to show that this character is the Mysterious Pass. Clearly, this \"center\" is not the middle between inside and outside, nor the midpoint between top and bottom, nor the center within a center.\n\nThe Buddhists say: \"Neither think of good nor think of evil; at just such a time, what is one’s original face?\" This is the center of the Chan school. The Confucians say: \"Before joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure are aroused, it is called the center\"—this is the center of the Ru school. The Daoists say: \"Where thoughts do not arise is called the center\"—this is the center of the Daoist school. These are the centers employed by the Three Teachings.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* says: \"Still and unmoving, this is the substance of the center; moved and thus penetrating, this is the function of the center.\" Laozi said: \"Attain utmost emptiness, guard steadfast stillness; the myriad things arise together, and I thereby observe their return.\" The *Book of Changes* says: \"Return is how the heart of Heaven and Earth is seen.\" Now, in the *Return* hexagram, one yang is born beneath five yins. Yin is stillness; yang is movement. When stillness reaches its extreme, movement is born. This very point of movement is the Mysterious Pass. Simply apply effort at the moment of thought’s arising in the twelve double-hours, and the Mysterious Pass will naturally appear. Once the Mysterious Pass is seen, the medicine, fire times, operations, drawing forth and adding—even the transformation of the embryo and the shedding of the mortal form—all proceed from this single aperture.\n\nTo gather the medicine is to gather the true lead and true mercury within the body. The medicine arises at a specific time—not at the winter solstice, not at the moon’s birth, not at the zi hour. The patriarchs said: \"To refine the Elixir, one need not seek the winter solstice; within the body, a yang is spontaneously born.\" They also said: \"When lead sees gui arising, swiftly gather it; when gold meets the full moon, it is no longer fit to taste.\" Thus, when gui arises and a yang is born within the body, one may begin to gather it. After the Two Qi unite, one must recognize how to maintain fullness and not overdo it—when the moon is full, it is no longer fit to taste.\n\nAdvancing fire and retreating tally lack a standard, so the sages used the seasons of a year—the coming and going of cold and heat—as the model for fire and tally. They also used the waxing and waning of a month to illustrate the principles of drawing forth and adding. For example, at the winter solstice, one yang is born—the *Return* hexagram, the twelfth month. Two yangs form the *Approach* hexagram, the first month; three yangs the *Peace* hexagram, the second month; four yangs the *Great Strength* hexagram, the third month; five yangs the *Decisiveness* hexagram, the fourth month. Pure yang is the *Qian* hexagram, where yang reaches its extreme and yin is born—the fifth month. One yin forms the *Encounter* hexagram, the sixth month; two yins the *Following* hexagram, the seventh month; three yins the *Stagnation* hexagram, the eighth month; four yins the *Observation* hexagram, the ninth month; five yins the *Splitting Apart* hexagram, the tenth month. Pure yin is the *Kun* hexagram, where yin reaches its extreme and yang is born—cycling back to the beginning. This is the mechanism of advancing and retreating fire and tally.\n\nYet students cling to words and adhere to images, beginning to advance fire on the winter solstice, retreating tally on the summer solstice, and bathing in the second and eighth months—utterly unaware of the essentials. Seeing that students misdirect their efforts, the sages condensed the seasons of a year into a single month: the new and full moons represent the winter and summer solstices, the two quarters represent the second and eighth months, two and a half days represent a month, and thirty days represent a year. Yet people still fixate on the moon. The sages further condensed the waxing and waning of a month into a single day: zi and wu represent the new and full moons, mao and you represent the two quarters. Students then fixate on the day.\n\nA recent perfected master said: \"Within a single moment of effort, the seasons of a year are contained.\"",

      "original_text": "又曰：父母未生以前，乌有年月日时。 此圣人诱喻初学勿错用心。 奈何执着之徒，不穷其理，执文泥象，徒尔劳心。 余今直指与汝，身中癸生便是一阳也，阳升阴降便是三阳也。 阴阳分，是四阳，体二月，如上弦，比卯时，宜沐浴然后进火。 阴阳交，神气合，六阳也。 阴阳相交，神气混融之后，要识持盈，不知止足，前功俱废。 故曰：金逢望远不堪尝。 然后退符，象一阴，乃至阴阳分，象三阴，阴阳伏位，宜沐浴，象八月，比下弦，如酉时也。 然后退至六阴，阴极阳生，顷刻之间，一周天也。 汝但依而行之，久久工夫，渐凝渐结，无质生质，结成圣胎，谓之丹成也。 定庵曰：下手工夫，周天运用，已蒙开发，种种异名不能尽知，望师指示。 师曰：异名者，只是譬喻，无出身心两字。 下工之际，凝耳韵，含眼光，缄舌气，调鼻息，四大不动。 使精、神、魂、魄、意，各安其位，谓之五气朝元。 运入中宫，谓之攒簇五行。 心不动，龙吟； 身不动，虎啸； 身心不动谓之降龙伏虎。 龙吟则气固，虎啸则精固，握固灵根也。 以精气喻之龟蛇，以身心喻之龙虎。 〔龙虎〕龟蛇打成一片，谓之合和四象。 以性摄情，谓之金木并。 以精御气，谓之水火交。 木与火同源，两性一家，东三南二同成五也。 水与金同源，两性一家，北一西方四共之也。 土居中宫，属意，自己五数戊己，还从生数五。 心身意打成一片，三家相见结婴儿，总谓之三五混融也。 炼精化气，炼气化神，炼神还虚，谓之三花聚鼎，又谓之三关。 今之学人多指尾闾、夹脊、玉枕为三关者，只是功法，非至要也。 举心动念处为玄牝，今人指口鼻者，非也。 身、心、意为三要。 心中之性谓之砂中汞。 身中之气谓之水中金。 金本生水，乃水之母，金反居水中，故曰母隐子胎。 外境勿令入，内境勿令出，谓之固济。 寂然不动，谓之养火。 虚无自然，谓之运用。 存诚笃志，谓之守城。 降伏内魔，谓之野战。 真汞谓之姹女，真铅谓之婴儿。 胎意谓之黄婆。 性情谓之夫妇。 澄心定意，性寂神灵，二物成团，三元辐辏，谓之成胎。 爱护灵根，谓之温养。 所谓温养者，如龙养珠，如鸡覆子，谨谨护持，勿令差失，毫发有差，前功俱废也。 阳神出壳，谓之脱胎。 归根复命，还其本初，谓之超脱。 打破虚空，谓之了当也。 定庵曰：金丹成时，还可见否？ 答曰：可见。 曰：有形否？ 曰：无形。 问曰：既无形，如何可见？ 答曰：金丹只是强名，岂有形乎。 所谓可见者，不可以眼见。 释曰：於不见中亲见，亲见中不见。 道经云：视之不见，听之不闻，斯谓之道。 视之不见，未尝不见。 听之不闻，未尝不闻。 所谓可见可闻，非耳目所及也，心见意闻而已。 譬如大风起，入山撼木，入水扬波，岂得谓之无？ 观之不见，搏之不得，岂得谓之有？ 金丹之体亦复如是。 所以炼丹之初，有无互用，动静相须，乃至成功。 诸缘顿息，万法皆空，动静俱忘，有无俱遣，始得玄珠成象，太一归真也。 性命双全，形神俱妙，出有入无，逍遥云际，果证金仙也。 所以经典丹书，种种异名，接引学人，从粗达妙，渐入佳境。 及至见性悟空，其事却不在纸上。 譬若过河之舟，济度斯民，既登彼岸，舟船无用矣。",
      "translated_text": "It further states: Before father and mother gave birth, where were the years, months, days, and hours? This is how the sages guide beginners to avoid misdirecting their efforts. Yet stubborn disciples, failing to fathom the principle, cling to forms and symbols, exhausting their minds in vain. I now point directly to you: the arising of *gui* within the body is the first yang; yang ascending and yin descending is the three yangs. When yin and yang divide, it is the four yangs—embodying the second month, like the waxing crescent, corresponding to *mao* hour, where one should bathe before advancing fire. When yin and yang unite and spirit and qi merge, it is the six yangs. After yin and yang intermingle and spirit and qi fuse, one must recognize the need to hold fullness, knowing when to stop lest all prior effort be wasted. Thus it is said: \"Gold at its zenith is too distant to taste.\" Then one retreats the tally, embodying the first yin, until yin and yang divide again, symbolizing the three yins—this is the time for bathing, like the eighth month, corresponding to the waning crescent, as in *you* hour. Then, retreating to the six yins, at the extreme of yin, yang is born—within a single moment, a full celestial cycle is completed. Simply follow this practice, and over time, effort gradually congeals and coalesces; the formless generates form, and the sacred embryo is forged—this is called the completion of the elixir.\n\nDing’an asked: \"The initial effort and the celestial cycle’s operation have already been revealed, yet the myriad alternate names remain beyond my grasp. I hope the master will point them out.\"\nThe master replied: \"Alternate names are merely metaphors, all deriving from the two words *body* and *mind*. At the outset of practice, gather the ear’s resonance, contain the eye’s light, seal the tongue’s breath, regulate the nose’s breathing—so the four great elements remain unmoving. Let essence, spirit, ethereal soul, corporeal soul, and intent each settle in their place: this is called the *five qi converging at the origin*. Directing them into the central palace is called *gathering the five phases*. When the mind is still, the dragon hums; when the body is still, the tiger roars; when body and mind are both still, this is called *subduing the dragon and taming the tiger*. The dragon’s hum secures qi; the tiger’s roar secures essence—grasping firmly the numinous root. Essence and qi are likened to the tortoise and snake; body and mind to the dragon and tiger. When dragon-tiger and tortoise-snake merge into one, it is called *harmonizing the four images*. Governing emotion with nature is called *metal and wood in union*. Directing qi with essence is called *water and fire in communion*. Wood and fire share a source, two natures forming one family—east’s three and south’s two together make five. Water and metal share a source, two natures forming one family—north’s one and west’s four are jointly held. Earth dwells in the central palace, belonging to intent; the five numbers of *wu* and *ji* return to the generative number five. When body, mind, and intent merge into one, the three families meet to form the infant—this is called *the three and five in fusion*. Refining essence into qi, refining qi into spirit, refining spirit into emptiness—this is called *the three flowers gathering in the tripod*, or *the three passes*. Today’s practitioners often designate the coccyx, the spine’s midpoint, and the jade pillow as the three passes, but these are merely methods, not the essentials. Where the mind stirs with thought is the *mysterious female*; those who point to the mouth and nose are mistaken. Body, mind, and intent are the three essentials. The nature within the mind is called *mercury within cinnabar*; the qi within the body is called *metal within water*. Metal inherently generates water, being water’s mother, yet metal resides within water—thus it is said: *the mother conceals the child’s embryo*. Do not let external realms enter, nor internal realms depart: this is called *sealing and securing*. Motionless stillness is called *nurturing the fire*. Spontaneous emptiness is called *operation*. Sincerity and unwavering resolve are called *guarding the city*. Subduing inner demons is called *field combat*. True mercury is called the *radiant maiden*; true lead is called the *infant*. The embryonic intent is called the *yellow woman*. Nature and emotion are called *husband and wife*. Calming the mind and settling intent, with nature still and spirit numinous, the two substances form a mass, the three origins converge—this is called *forming the embryo*. Cherishing the numinous root is called *warm nurturing*. Warm nurturing is like a dragon tending its pearl, like a hen brooding her eggs—guard it diligently, lest even a hair’s deviation ruin all prior effort. When the yang spirit emerges from the husk, it is called *shedding the embryo*. Returning to the root and restoring life is called *transcending and liberation*. Shattering emptiness is called *fulfillment*.\n\nDing’an asked: \"When the golden elixir is formed, can it still be seen?\"\nThe master replied: \"It can.\"\nDing’an asked: \"Does it have form?\"\nThe master replied: \"It has no form.\"\nDing’an asked: \"If it has no form, how can it be seen?\"\nThe master replied: \"The golden elixir is but a forced name—how could it have form? What is called *visible* cannot be seen with the eyes.\"\nA Buddhist text says: \"Within non-seeing, one intimately sees; within intimate seeing, one does not see.\"\nThe *Daoist Scripture* states: \"Looked for but not seen, listened for but not heard—this is called the Dao. Looked for but not seen, yet never not seen; listened for but not heard, yet never not heard.\" What is called *visible and audible* is not within the reach of ears and eyes—only the mind sees, only intent hears. For example, when a great wind rises, entering mountains it shakes trees, entering water it stirs waves—how can one say it does not exist? Yet when observed, it cannot be seen; when grasped, it cannot be held—how can one say it exists? The essence of the golden elixir is likewise. Thus, at the outset of elixir refinement, being and non-being mutually employ each other, movement and stillness depend on one another, until success is achieved. All conditions suddenly cease, all dharmas become empty; movement and stillness are both forgotten, being and non-being are both transcended—only then does the mysterious pearl take form, and the Great One return to truth. With nature and life both complete, form and spirit both wondrous, one emerges from being and enters non-being, roaming freely beyond the clouds—truly attaining the golden immortal. Therefore, the classics and elixir texts employ myriad alternate names to guide practitioners, leading them from the coarse to the subtle, gradually entering the wondrous realm. Yet upon seeing nature and awakening to emptiness, the matter no longer lies on paper. It is like a boat crossing the river, ferrying the people—once the far shore is reached, the boat is no longer needed.\"",

Yet people still fixate on the moon. The sages further condensed the waxing and waning of a month into a single day: zi and wu represent the new and full moons, mao and you represent the two quarters. Students then fixate on the day.\n\nA recent perfected master said: \"Within a single moment of effort, the seasons of a year are contained.\"",

      "translated_text": "The former worthies said: \"Having caught the hare, forget the snare; having caught the fish, forget the trap\"—this is precisely what is meant. Now, as I speak these words to you, do not cling to the language itself. Simply chew them thoroughly and savor them deeply, for they have yet to exhaust the source. If, upon hearing a single phrase, the ground of your mind opens and you directly enter the realm of non-doing, this is not difficult. There are yet higher mechanisms that cannot be lightly described; they must be sought beyond words.\n\n*Questions on the Golden Elixir*\nI have observed that later commentaries on the elixir classics and philosophical texts vary in their interpretations. Some fixate on the physical form, others on written words; some take purity as bitter emptiness, others regard mercury and lead as having tangible form. With such differing views, how can later generations avoid confusion? Yet the supreme Dao is one—how could there be two?\n\nMoreover, many recent elixir texts compile only side doors. For instance, explaining the seven returns and nine reversions through the cyclical positions of *yin* and *zi*, or *kun* and *shen*—is this not erroneous? I have now gathered the essentials of elixir texts into *Thirty-Six Questions*, to dispel the confusion of later practitioners. Those who understand may savor them.\n\n**Question:** What is the nine reversion?\n**Answer:** Nine is the completion number of metal. Reversion means returning to the origin—this is simply using nature to govern emotion. Emotion belongs to metal; when emotion returns to nature, it is called the nine reversion. The elixir texts say: \"When metal returns to nature at first, it may be called the reverted elixir.\" This is what is meant. To take the progression from *zi* to *shen* as the nine reversion is incorrect.\n\n**Question:** What is the seven return?\n**Answer:** Seven is the completion number of fire. Return means returning to the root—this is simply refining spirit to return to emptiness. Spirit belongs to fire; refining spirit to return to emptiness is called the seven return. To take the progression from *yin* to *shen* as the seven return is incorrect. *The Awakening to Reality* says: \"Do not rely on the *yin*-*zi* or *kun*-*shen* cycles; only the standard of the five phases matters.\" This is precisely the point.\n\n**Question:** What are the three passes?\n**Answer:** They are the mechanisms of the three origins. Refining essence into qi is the first pass; refining qi into spirit is the middle pass; refining spirit to return to emptiness is the upper pass. To point to the coccyx, spine, and jade pillow as the three passes is merely a working method, not the essential teaching. The essentials of attaining truth lie in the three passes—how could they have fixed locations? They reside in the oral instructions.\n\n**Question:** What is the mysterious pass?\n**Answer:** It is the most mysterious and wondrous mechanism. It has no fixed location. Today, many point to the navel wheel, the crown of the head, the glabella, the space between the kidneys, or the area between the kidneys and navel—all these are side doors. The elixir texts say: \"The mysterious pass is an aperture not in the four directions, above or below, inside or outside, nor to the side, nor even in the center—it is where the four great elements and five phases do not adhere.\"\n\n**Question:** What are the three palaces?\n**Answer:** They are the palaces where the three origins reside. Spirit dwells in the *qian* palace, qi in the central palace, and essence in the *kun* palace. To point to the three fields is incorrect.\n\n**Question:** What are the three essentials?\n**Answer:** The aperture of returning to the root, the pass of reviving life, and the valley of emptiness—these are the three essentials. To point to the mouth and nose as the three essentials is incorrect.\n\n**Question:** What is the mysterious female?\n**Answer:** \"The valley spirit does not die—this is called the mysterious female.\" To point to the mouth and nose is incorrect. The Perfected One of Purple Yang said: \"Where the thought arises is the mysterious female.\" This is correct. I say: where the thought arises is the root of life and death—how could it not be the mysterious female? Though this, too, is a working method. The supreme vehicle lies in the oral instructions.\n\n**Question:** What is the true seed?\n**Answer:** Before heaven and earth divided, that single point of numinous clarity—this is it. Some say humans arise from a single qi and take qi as the true seed. Others say the body arises from thought and take thought as the true seed. Still others say the body arises from the essence of the two and five, taking essence as the true seed. These three explanations seem correct but are not. The Buddha said: \"The root of birth and death through countless kalpas—fools call it the original true.\" This is what is meant.\n\n**Question:** What is the tripod and furnace?\n**Answer:** Body and mind are the tripod and furnace. The elixir texts say: \"First take *qian* and *kun* as the tripod vessel, then gather the sun and moon as medicine to refine.\" *Qian* is the mind, *kun* is the body. Those who set up furnaces and tripods externally are mistaken.\n\n**Question:** What are the medicinal substances?\n**Answer:** True lead and true mercury are the medicinal substances—these are simply the original two things.\n\n**Question:** What are the inner and outer medicines?\n**Answer:** Refining essence, refining qi, refining spirit—their substance is one, but their functions differ. The essence of intercourse, the qi of breathing, and the spirit of thought—these are the outer medicines. The primordial supreme essence, the empty and void qi, and the indestructible original spirit—these are the inner medicines. The elixir texts say: \"The twofold function of inner and outer\"—this is what is meant.\n\n**Question:** What does \"knocking bamboo to summon the turtle and swallow the jade mushroom\" mean?\n**Answer:** Knocking bamboo means regulating the breath. Summoning the turtle means gathering essence. Refining essence into qi, using qi to gather essence, essence and qi blending and fusing to form the jade mushroom—gathering and swallowing it preserves life.\n\n**Question:** What does \"strumming the zither to summon the phoenix and drink the knife-powder\" mean?\n**Answer:** Strumming the zither means emptying the mind. Summoning the phoenix means nurturing spirit. Emptying the mind and nurturing spirit, the mind becomes clear and spirit transforms—earth of the two [spleen and stomach] forms the powder. Gathering and drinking it perfects the nature.\n\n**Question:** What is the five qi returning to the origin?\n**Answer:** When the body does not move, essence is firm—water returns to the origin. When the mind does not move, qi is firm—fire returns to the origin. When nature is quiescent, the hun-spirit is stored—wood returns to the origin. When emotion is forgotten, the po-spirit is subdued—metal returns to the origin.",

      "translated_text": "When the four great elements are harmonious, intention settles—earth returns to the origin. This is called the five qi returning to the origin.\n\n**Question:** What is the Yellow Dame?\n**Answer:** Yellow is the color of the center. Dame is the title of the mother. All things are born of earth, and earth is the mother of all things, thus she is called the Yellow Dame. The fetal intention in humans is this. Some say the spleen spirit is the Yellow Dame, but this is incorrect.\n\n**Question:** What is the Metal Duke?\n**Answer:** In principle, the yang within Qian enters Kun to form Kan. Kan is water, and metal is the father of water, thus it is called the Metal Duke. In symbolic terms, the character for \"duke\" (公) is added to the edge of \"metal\" (金), signifying lead.\n\n**Question:** Kan is the Great Yin—how then is it likened to an infant?\n**Answer:** Kan is originally the body of Kun, thus it is called the Great Yin. Having received the yang of Qian, it becomes Shaoyang, and so it is likened to an infant—carrying yin while embracing yang.\n\n**Question:** Li is the Great Yang—why then is it likened to the maiden?\n**Answer:** Li is originally the body of Qian, thus it is called the Great Yang. Having received the yin of Kun, it becomes Shaoyin, and so it is likened to the maiden—yang enfolding yin within.\n\n**Question:** What is true gold?\n**Answer:** Gold is the original spirit, imperishable through kalpas, growing ever brighter with refinement—thus it is called true gold.\n\n**Question:** What is meant by mother and child?\n**Answer:** It is metal within water. Metal is the mother of water, and metal is concealed within water—thus the mother hides within the child’s womb. Likewise, spirit is the mother of the body, and spirit is concealed within the body, likened to the mother hiding within the child’s womb.\n\n**Question:** What is meant by guest and host?\n**Answer:** Nature is the master of the body, while the body is the guest. Now, borrowing this body to nurture this nature, we let the body serve as the host. As the alchemical texts say: *\"Let him be the host while I remain the guest.\"*\n\n**Question:** What is the primordial qi?\n**Answer:** Before heaven and earth were divided, there was only a single numinous essence—this is the true yang within the body. As it precedes the covering and bearing of heaven and earth, it is called the primordial.\n\n**Question:** What are water and fire?\n**Answer:** Heaven takes the sun and moon as water and fire; the *Yi* takes Kan and Li as water and fire; Chan takes samadhi and wisdom as water and fire; the sages take clarity and moisture as water and fire; medicine takes the heart and kidneys as water and fire; the Dao of alchemy takes essence and qi as water and fire. I now clearly point out: within one’s own body, all that flames above is fire, and all that moistens below is water. Though the names vary, they are but metaphors to guide the learner toward self-realization.\n\n**Question:** How is there water within fire?\n**Answer:** From of old, divine water flows from the high plateau. In principle, water cannot moisten itself—it relies on fire’s steaming to become moist. In symbolic terms, fire flourishes at *wu*, while water receives its qi at *wu*. Thus, it is clear that water exists within fire. In the body, this is the fluid within qi.\n\n**Question:** How is there fire within water?\n**Answer:** In principle, the sun emerges from the sea. In symbolic terms, water flourishes at *zi*, while fire gestates within *zi*. In the body, this is the qi within essence.\n\n**Question:** What is the completed crossing?\n**Answer:** Water ascending and fire descending is called the completed crossing. The *Yi* says: *\"Mountain below marsh—diminishing. The noble one uses this to restrain anger and suppress desire.\"* This is the method of the completed crossing: restraining anger causes fire to descend, and suppressing desire causes water to ascend.\n\n**Question:** What is the uncompleted crossing?\n**Answer:** Failing to restrain anger, fire blazes upward; failing to suppress desire, water sinks and dampens. The fire of ignorance rages, waves surge in the sea of suffering, and water and fire do not merge—this is called the uncompleted crossing.\n\n**Question:** What is the merging of metal and wood?\n**Answer:** When emotion returns to nature, it is called their merging. Emotion belongs to metal, and nature belongs to wood.\n\n**Question:** What is separation?\n**Answer:** When emotion pursues objects and nature follows thoughts, emotion and nature diverge—this is called separation.\n\n**Question:** What are clarity and turbidity?\n**Answer:** When the mind does not move, water returns to its source—thus it is clear. When the mind moves, water follows the current—thus it is turbid.\n\n**Question:** What are the two eights?\n**Answer:** It is the measure of one *jin*. Half a *jin* of lead, eight *liang* of mercury—though there are no true weights, the two must be balanced. Thus it is called the two eights. The alchemical texts say: *\"After the first quarter and before the last quarter, the medicine is level and the fire force complete.\"* This compares the balance of yin and yang. It is also like the second and eighth months, when day and night are equal.\n\n**Question:** What is bathing?\n**Answer:** Washing the mind and cleansing thoughts is called bathing.\n\n**Question:** What is the completion of the elixir?\n**Answer:** When body and mind unite, spirit and qi merge, and emotion and nature become one—this is called the completion of the elixir, likened to the sacred embryo. As the immortal master said: *\"When true nature arrives, it is the golden elixir—refining the four illusions into a single pellet.\"*\n\n**Question:** What is nurturing the fire?",
      "overlap_context": "r and spirit transforms—earth of the two [spleen and stomach] forms the powder. Gathering and drinking it perfects the nature.\n\n**Question:** What is the five qi returning to the origin?\n**Answer:** When the body does not move, essence is firm—water returns to the origin. When the mind does not move, qi is firm—fire returns to the origin. When nature is quiescent, the hun-spirit is stored—wood returns to the origin. When emotion is forgotten, the po-spirit is subdued—metal returns to the origin.",

      "translated_text": "Answer: To extinguish all thoughts is nurturing the fire.\n\n**Question:** What is shedding the embryo?\n**Answer:** When there is a body beyond the body, this is called shedding the embryo.\n\n**Question:** What is ultimate completion?\n**Answer:** To become one with the Great Void is called ultimate completion.\n\nThe transformations beyond phenomena are not easily described in passing—it depends on one’s own realization.\n\n**The Living Method of Quanzhen**\nTransmitted to Disciples\n\nA Quanzhen Daoist should practice the Way of Quanzhen. What is called *Quanzhen*? It means preserving one’s original truth. Only when essence, qi, and spirit are all whole is it called *Quanzhen*. Any deficiency renders it incomplete; any stain renders it impure.\n\nPreserving essence can protect the body. To preserve essence, first stabilize the body—stability eliminates desire, and thus essence is whole.\n\nPreserving qi can nourish the mind. To preserve qi, first purify the mind—purity eliminates thoughts, and thus qi is whole.\n\nPreserving spirit can return to emptiness. To preserve spirit, first make the intention sincere—sincerity unites body and mind, returning to emptiness.\n\nThus, essence, qi, and spirit are the three primordial medicines; body, mind, and intention are the three primordial essentials. In learning the immortal’s method, one need not do much—simply refine the three treasures of essence, qi, and spirit as the foundation of the elixir. When the three treasures gather in the Central Palace, the golden elixir is complete. Is this not easy to know? Is it difficult to practice? What is difficult to know or practice arises only from delusion and confusion.\n\nThe essentials of refining essence lie in the body. When the body is still, the tiger roars and wind arises, the dark turtle lies hidden, and primordial essence congeals.\n\nThe essentials of refining qi lie in the mind. When the mind is still, the dragon chants and clouds gather, the vermilion bird folds its wings, and primordial qi rests.\n\nThe essentials of generating spirit lie in intention. When intention is still, the two substances merge, the three primordials unite as one, and the sacred embryo forms.\n\nThe cauldron of Qian and Kun, the medicines of Kan and Li, the three primordials of the Eight Trigrams, the five phases and four images—none transcend the three words *body, mind, intention*. The ultimate attainment of *Quanzhen* lies in nothing beyond the two words *body and mind*. To depart from body and mind is to follow an external path. Yet one must not cling to body and mind either—any attachment to them becomes a burden. One must use them without being bound by them.\n\nWhat I call *body and mind* are not the illusory physical body and fleshly heart, but the invisible body and mind. How to describe the invisible body and mind? *\"Clouds rise from the mountain, the moon enters the heart of the waves.\"* The body is the pure body since time immemorial, the wondrous existence within non-being. The mind is the numinous origin before the Emperor of Form, the true non-being within being. Non-being containing being resembles Kan; being containing non-being resembles Li. The ancestral master said: *\"Take the solid center of the Kan position, and transmute the yin within the Li palace. From this, it transforms into the vigorous body of Qian—hidden or soaring, all depends on the mind.\"*\n\nI say that the two words *body and mind* are the ultimate attainment of *Quanzhen*—what doubt remains?\n\nThe essentials of elixir refinement lie solely in *nature and life*. To depart from nature and life is to enter side doors, clinging to one side and calling it *partial withering*. The ancestral master said: *\"Spirit is nature, qi is life.\"* This is the meaning.\n\nRefining qi lies in protecting the body; refining spirit lies in protecting the heart. When the body is still, the tiger roars; when the mind is still, the dragon chants. The tiger’s roar sends lead into mercury; the dragon’s chant sends mercury into lead. Lead and mercury are alternate names for Kan and Li. The yang within Kan is the supreme essence within the body; the yin within Li is the primordial qi within the mind.\n\nRefining essence into qi begins with protecting the body; refining qi into spirit begins with protecting the heart. When the body is stable, form is firm—form firm, life is complete. When the mind is stable, spirit is whole—spirit whole, nature is complete. Body and mind unite, nature and life are whole, form and spirit are wondrous—this is called the completion of the elixir.\n\nRefining essence into qi and qi into spirit is not yet extraordinary—why? Because there remains the subtlety of refining spirit, which is not easily spoken of lightly. What I have previously outlined of the great outline of the golden elixir—if you have the eye to see here, you will know the great matter does not lie on paper. If not, you must first know where to begin. Once you know where to begin, proceed from there. Start by refining essence; when essence abides, then refine qi; when qi stabilizes, then refine spirit; when spirit congeals, then return to emptiness. Empty it again and again, and virtue and Dao are complete.\n\nRefining essence depends on knowing the *moment*. What is called *moment* is not the time of the clock. To fixate on time is to miss it. If one says there is no moment, how does one begin? What, after all, is to be done? Ah! The ancients said: *\"When the moment arrives, the spirit knows.\"* The ancestral master said: *\"When lead sees the birth of gui, hasten to gather it.\"* These words say it all.\n\nRefining qi depends on *harmonizing and blending*. What is called *harmonizing and blending* is harmonizing the true breath and regulating the true origin. Laozi said: *\"The gate of the mysterious female is called the root of heaven and earth. Subtle and continuous, its use is inexhaustible.\"* Is this not the essential of harmonizing and blending? Today, people point to the mouth and nose as the gate of the mysterious female—this is incorrect. The mysterious female is the mechanism of heaven and earth’s opening and closing. The *Book of Changes* says: *\"Closing the door is called Kun; opening the door is called Qian. Opening and closing are called change.\"* Opening and closing are movement and stillness. This is the meaning of Laozi’s *\"its use is inexhaustible.\"*\n\nThe alchemical texts say: *\"Exhale to connect with the root of heaven; inhale to connect with the root of earth. Exhale, and the dragon chants as clouds rise; inhale, and the tiger roars as wind stirs.\"* I say: *\"Exhale to connect with the root of heaven; inhale to connect with the root of earth\"* is *\"closing the door is called Kun; opening the door is called Qian.\"* *\"Exhale, and the dragon chants as clouds rise; inhale, and the tiger roars as wind stirs\"* is *\"opening and closing are called change\"*—this is also the meaning of *\"its use is inexhaustible.\"*",

      "translated_text": "**On Nature and Life**\nBy Li Daochun Yuanfu of Dulian Qing’an Jingchanzi\nCompiled by Disciple Sun’an Baochanzi Cai Zhiyi\n\nWhat is *xing* (nature)? It is the primordial, supremely numinous, singular spirit. What is *ming* (life)? It is the primordial, supremely refined, singular *qi*. Essence and *xing* are the root of *ming*. The transformations of *xing* depend on the heart-mind; the transformations of *ming* depend on the body. Discernment and wisdom arise from the heart-mind; thoughts and reflections are the heart-mind’s servitude of *xing*. Actions and responses arise from the body; speech and silence, seeing and hearing are the body’s burdens upon *ming*. When *ming* bears the body’s burdens, there is birth and death. When *xing* is subjected to the heart-mind’s servitude, there is coming and going. Know then that \"body\" and \"heart-mind\" are the abode of spirit and essence, while spirit and essence are the root of *xing* and *ming*. *Xing* cannot stand without *ming*; *ming* cannot exist without *xing*. Though their names are two, their principle is one.\n\nAlas! Today’s learners, black-robed monks, and Daoist adepts divide *xing* and *ming* into two, each clinging to one side, mutually disputing right and wrong. They do not realize that solitary yin or orphaned yang cannot accomplish the great work. Those who cultivate *ming* without understanding *xing* will not escape karmic fate; those who perceive *xing* without knowing *ming*—where will they ultimately return? The Immortal Master said: \"To refine the Golden Elixir without fathoming *xing* is the foremost malady in cultivation. To refine only the true *xing* without refining the Elixir—even after ten thousand kalpas, the radiant spirit will not attain sagehood.\" Truly, these are weighty words.\n\nThe loftiest adepts comprehend both *xing* and *ming*: first upholding the precepts, concentration, and wisdom to empty the heart-mind; then refining essence, *qi*, and spirit to preserve the body. When the body is at peace, the foundation of *ming* is eternally firm; when the heart-mind is emptied and clarified, the root of *xing* is perfectly luminous. When *xing* is luminous, there is neither coming nor going; when *ming* is firm, there is neither death nor birth. As for merging into perfect wholeness, directly entering non-action—*xing* and *ming* are both complete, form and spirit both wondrous.\n\nYet one must not assert that *xing* and *ming* are originally two, nor treat them as a single matter. They are fundamentally one, but in application, they are two. If one clings to partiality and enters through a single gate, this is a failure to understand *xing* and *ming*. Failing to understand *xing* and *ming* is to sunder them into two. If *xing* and *ming* do not mutually sustain each other, how can one ascend to truth and tread the celestial realms?\n\n**On the Symbolism of Hexagrams**\nThe Perfected One Haiqiong said: \"The highest-grade elixir method requires no hexagrams or lines.\" Why then do all elixir texts employ hexagrams and lines? This is the Sage’s pedagogical device to reveal the Dao. As the ancients said: \"The Great Dao is wordless; without words, its Dao cannot be revealed.\" This is the meaning.\n\nThe term \"hexagram\" (*gua*) means \"to hang.\" Like hanging an object in empty space to display it to others, or as heaven suspends images to show fortune and misfortune, making them easily visible. \"Image\" (*xiang*) means \"to resemble this\"; \"line\" (*yao*) means \"to emulate this.\" A hexagram of three lines symbolizes the Three Powers—these are one’s Three Origins. A hexagram of six lines symbolizes the Six Voids—these are one’s Six Harmonies. Elixir texts use hexagrams and lines to guide practitioners in modeling the furnace, following the lines to advance the fire, and easily establishing standards.\n\nWhen the Perfected One Haiqiong spoke of \"no hexagrams or lines,\" he was warning later generations not to become fixated on line symbols—using them while transcending them. For example, before this body was born, it was quiescent and unmoving, like the ode to the undivided Supreme Ultimate. With the arising of this body, *xing* and *ming* are established—this is the Supreme Ultimate generating the Two Modes. With form comes *xing* and temperament—this is the Two Modes generating the Four Images. As for spirit, *hun*, *po*, intention, *qi*, body, and heart-mind—all are fully possessed—this is the Four Images generating the Eight Trigrams.\n\nThe ancients said: \"If names are not released, then in the Palace of Li, cultivate concentration; returning to the Dao, seek the mysterious in the Water Mansion.\" This refers to the essentials of refining *xing* and *ming*. \"Cultivating concentration in the Palace of Li\" means upholding precepts, concentration, and wisdom, so that all dust does not adhere and the myriad things are empty—this is removing the yin within Li. \"Seeking the mysterious in the Water Mansion\" means refining essence, *qi*, and spirit, so that the Three Flowers gather in the tripod, the Five *Qi* return to the origin, and the yang within Kan is preserved.\n\nThe profoundly enlightened adept holds both principles together: embracing yin while carrying yang, emptying the heart-mind and filling the abdomen—this is extracting the yang within Kan to replenish the yin within Li, thereby re-forming the Qian body. The Perfected One Ziyang said:\n*\"Take the solid center from Kan’s position,\nTo transmute the yin within Li’s palace.\nFrom this, transform into Qian’s vigorous body—\nConcealment and soaring are all at the heart’s command.\"*\nThis is precisely the meaning.\n\nIn employing hexagrams and lines for fire phases, the two hexagrams Qian and Kun—vigorous and yielding—mutually interact, advancing and retreating to determine the four seasons and complete the year. The four virtues operate and transform without end. The progression and retreat of fire, the extraction and addition, increase and decrease—all are modeled upon them. A year is condensed into a month, a month into a day, a day into an hour, an hour into a *ke*, a *ke* into a single breath. From the vastness of cosmic eras and kalpas to the subtlety of a single breath, each has a complete cycle of movement. Those who grasp this principle have attained the essentials of advancing fire and withdrawing the tally.\n\nYet in the Dao of the Elixir, hexagrams are used for the method, and lines for the fire phases—all are metaphors. One must not cling to hexagrams and lines. Know that to cross a river, one needs a raft; upon reaching the shore, the boat is no longer needed. Having caught the fish, forget the trap; having snared the hare, forget the snare. The Perfected One Ziyang said:\n*\"Within this, grasp the meaning and cease seeking images;\nTo exhaust the lines is but to labor the emotions.\"*\nAnd again:\n*\"Without carving time to divide midnight and noon,\nWithin the hexagrams and lines, Qian and Kun are determined.\"*\nBoth refer to this.\n\nI say: those born with knowledge obtain it without seeking, hitting the mark without effort—how could they rely on inducements and metaphors? Thus, the highest-grade elixir method does not employ hexagrams or lines. For those of middling and lesser capacity who cannot directly comprehend, gradual entry is necessary.",

      "translated_text": "Thus, all alchemical texts take hexagrams and lines as their method—those who comprehend savor them and attain realization on their own.\n\nOn life and death, the Most High said: *\"People treat death lightly because they cling so deeply to life; it is for this reason they treat death lightly.\"* And again: *\"Only those who do not prize life are wiser than those who value it.\"* This means that when one seeks life, it cannot be grasped—how then could death exist? Where there is life, there is death; without death, there is no life. Thus, in the great matter of nature and destiny, life and death are of utmost weight. To know death, one must first know life; knowing life, one naturally knows death. Zilu asked about death, and the Master said: *\"If you do not yet understand life, how can you understand death?\"* How profound the words of the Sage! The *Xici* speaks of *\"tracing beginnings to grasp endings\"*—does this not refer to the discourse on life and death?\n\nI say: those who study the Dao, if they wish to grasp the end, must first trace the beginning; if they wish to clarify the final outcome, they must thoroughly examine the present. If one is free and unburdened now, one will be free and unburdened at the end; if one is liberated now, one will be liberated at the end. From ancient times to the present, the sages of all ages who shed their mortal forms and transformed through spirit, responding to change without end—this is because they had previously refined themselves to purity, and thus at the end could ascend lightly. If there is one who, in ordinary circumstances, sees through every realm and penetrates it thoroughly, is not deluded by phenomena, and is not ensnared by conditions, then at the end no realm can delude him, and no condition can bind him.\n\nI see that those who meditate today, the moment they close their eyes, all manner of illusory and demonic visions appear before them. Once they enter these demonic realms, they become one with the yin demons, unaware of themselves. Even if some awaken, they cannot dispel them, becoming like a corpse with breath—possessing all six senses yet unable to act, tossed and disturbed without respite. If one is not free now, how can one be free at the shore of life and death? Only a resolute person, whether their eyes are open or closed, remains the same, untainted by any illusory realm, coming and going without attachment, attaining great freedom. If one is free and unburdened now, why fear not being so at the end?\n\nMaster Qing’an, not sparing his two flaps of skin, expounds for the likes of Sun’an: the work you do now is the great matter of the end; the present is the cause, the end is the effect. All thoughts and concerns now belong to the yin realm; all illusory conditions are demonic realms. If in ordinary times you can sweep them clean, at the end you will not be confused by them. Thoughts should be dispelled by principle; illusions should be severed by resolve. When thoughts cease, yin dissipates; when illusions vanish, demons perish, and yang arises. With long accumulation, yin is exhausted and yang is pure—this is called immortality. But if thoughts multiply and conditions arise, following desires and indulging them, then yin grows and demons flourish, and yang diminishes. With long accumulation, yang is exhausted and yin is pure—this is death.\n\nA great cultivator whose share of yin is not yet exhausted does not become immortal. An ordinary person whose share of yang is not yet exhausted does not die. Those who hold this view—the lofty adepts of the Mystery Gate and the assembly of Dharma—firmly resolve, maintain unwavering faith, and directly sweep clean, making themselves utterly bare and empty, allowing not even a speck of dust to cling. This is the pure Dharmakāya.\n\nIf you do not cling to any form, then no form clings to you;\nIf you do not stain yourself with any dharma, then no dharma grasps you;\nIf you do not see any thing, then no thing sees you;\nIf you do not know any affair, then no affair knows you;\nIf you do not hear any sound, then no sound hears you;\nIf you do not engage any perception, then no perception engages you.\nThe five aggregates and six consciousnesses are likewise so.\n\nWhen the six dusts do not enter, the six senses are pure; when the five aggregates are empty, the five eyes are perfectly clear. At this stage, the six senses intermingle and function as one, the whole body becomes an eye, all yin is exhausted, and the entire being is pure yang. Nature and destiny are both preserved, form and spirit are both wondrous, and one merges with the true Dao. What life and death is there to transcend? What present and end remains? Without cause, without effect, without existence, without nonexistence—how vast the lightness, how great the freedom! Ah, the wonder of the patience of the unborn Dharma is fully realized here.\n\nWritten on the fifteenth day of the first lunar month in the renchen year of the Zhiyuan era, by Qing’an Yingchanzi at Zhonghe Hermitage, for Cai Sun’an and others.\n\nOn movement and stillness, the Most High said: *\"Attain utmost emptiness, guard stillness firmly; as the myriad things arise together, I observe their return.\"* This speaks of stillness reaching its extreme and then moving. *\"The ten thousand things flourish, each returning to its root; returning to the root is called stillness—this is called restoring destiny.\"* This speaks of movement reaching its extreme and returning to stillness. And again: *\"Restoring destiny is called constancy.\"* This means that stillness moves and movement is still—this is the constancy of the Dao. If one takes movement as movement and stillness as stillness, that is the constancy of things.\n\nThe former worthies said: *\"Stillness moves, movement is still—this is spirit; movement without stillness, stillness without movement—this is matter.\"* Does this not refer to this? Thus, in preserving body and mind, nothing surpasses movement and stillness. Those who study the Dao gather body and mind, attain utmost emptiness, and guard stillness firmly—then they can observe return. The *Book of Changes* says: *\"Return—is this not the manifestation of Heaven and Earth’s heart?\"* The hexagram *Fu* (Return) arises from *Kun* (Receptive) and is stillness moving. Five yin lines are utterly still, and one yang moves below—this is called *Fu*. Is this not stillness reaching its extreme and then moving? Observing return, one knows transformation; knowing transformation, one is not transformed; not being transformed, one returns to the root.",

      "translated_text": "Returning to the root is called stillness—this is known as the restoration of life. Is this not movement returning to stillness?\n\nThe *Book of Changes*’ *Xici* states: *\"Closing the door is called Kun; opening the door is called Qian. The alternation of closing and opening is called change; the ceaseless coming and going is called penetration.\"* The alternation of closing and opening is the alternation of movement and stillness. Ceaseless coming and going is the unceasing of movement and stillness. Interacting movement and stillness, the mechanism endlessly operates—this is called transformation. Extending and enacting it, responding to change without end—this is called penetration.\n\nThe *Daodejing* says: *\"The valley spirit does not die—this is called the mysterious female.\"* This speaks of emptiness and numinous clarity, where the mechanism of movement and stillness cannot be concealed. It further states: *\"The gate of the mysterious female—this is called the root of Heaven and Earth.\"* This refers to Qian’s yang and Kun’s yin, the alternation of closing and opening that generates transformation. It also says: *\"Subtle and ever-present, its use is inexhaustible.\"* This is the ceaseless coming and going called penetration.\n\nThe root of Heaven opens and closes like a person’s breath. Exhaling connects to the root of Heaven—this is called opening; inhaling connects to the root of Earth—this is called closing. Exhaling, the dragon chants and clouds arise; inhaling, the tiger roars and wind stirs—this is called transformation. Wind and clouds converge, dragon and tiger intertwine, movement and stillness mutually arise—manifest and subtle are seamless—this is called penetration.\n\nWhat I call breath is not that of the mouth and nose, but the ceaseless, subtle flow of true breath. If one clings to the mouth and nose as the mysterious female, how can one fully grasp the divine dance of Heaven and Earth? Those who understand Heaven and Earth’s transformations and the workings of the spirit are called superior scholars. Those who comprehend this principle know that Qian’s Way is strong and unceasing—just as the heart moves without contrivance, ceaseless in effort. Kun’s Way is receptive and nurturing—just as the body is still and responds to things, its use inexhaustible.\n\nThe heart models Heaven and thus is clear; the body models Earth and thus is still. Abiding in clarity and stillness, the mechanism of Heaven and Earth’s opening and closing is maintained by me. The classic states: *\"Clarity is the source of turbidity; movement is the foundation of stillness. If one can abide in constant clarity and stillness, Heaven and Earth wholly return.\"* This speaks precisely of this.\n\nThe disciples of Jingxian An inquired of me about the essentials of preserving body and mind. I answered them with movement and stillness, intending that they gather body and mind and emulate the functions of Heaven and Earth. Preserving the body lies in harmonizing; preserving the heart lies in restraint. Harmonizing values movement; restraint values stillness. Movement emulates Heaven; stillness emulates Earth. When body and heart are both still, Heaven and Earth unite.\n\nAt the extreme of stillness, the true mechanism naturally and wondrously responds—this is no ordinary movement. This very mechanism of movement is the heart of Heaven. Once the heart of Heaven is revealed, the mysterious pass opens. Once the mysterious pass opens, the medicine and ingredients are here, the crucible and furnace are here, the firing times are here. The Three Origins, Eight Trigrams, Four Images, and Five Phases—all operations are fully contained within.\n\nAt this stage of practice, body and heart merge, movement and stillness mutually require each other, and the mechanism of Heaven and Earth’s opening and closing is entirely within me. When the heart returns to emptiness and quiescence, the body enters non-action, movement and stillness are both forgotten, essence congeals and qi transforms.\n\nHere, essence naturally transforms into qi, qi naturally transforms into spirit, spirit naturally transforms into emptiness, merging with the Great Void as one—this is called returning to the root and restoring the origin. Ah! The Way of longevity and enduring vision is fully realized here.\n\nWritten on the fourth day after the Lantern Festival of the renchen year of the Zhiyuan era, by Yingchanzi of Qing’an at the Zhonghe Retreat, for the disciples of Jingxian An.\n\n*Song: \"Hymn to the Original Dao\" – Gift to Yeyun*",

acted with integrity;\nIn the world, he moved with compliance;\nIn the heart, he cultivated gentleness;\nIn the body, he maintained stillness—\nThese are the moral principles of bamboo.\n\nIn action, he forgot emotion;\nIn stillness, he forgot thought;\nResponding to opportunity, he forgot the self;\nAdapting to change, he forgot things—\nThis is the inner emptiness of bamboo.\n\nHe established resolute determination,\nMaintained unwavering faith,\nHarmonized inner and outer,\nRemained unchanging from beginning to end—\nThis is the winter endurance of bamboo.\n\nHe broadly sought the company of the wise,\nVisited enlightened teachers far and wide,\nReceived wandering monks with cloud and water,\nAnd harmonized the Three Teachings—\nThis is the grove of bamboo.\n\nMoreover, he embraced simplicity and held to plainness,\nReduced selfishness and curbed desires,\nRegulated breath and cultivated sincerity,\nObserved transformations and knew renewal—\nWho but one who attains the utmost emptiness under Heaven could achieve this?\nThus, naming his studio after bamboo was most fitting.\n\nIn the xinmao year, a Quanzhen Daoist came to the Zhonghe Retreat in Jinling.\nHe spoke of profound virtue, and I deeply esteemed him.\nThereafter, he visited three times by cloud-chariot.\nObserving his words, I saw his aspiration for emptiness and tranquility.\nThus, on the Double Yang Festival of the jihai year, I soared across the void on a flying sword to visit the master.\nExamining his conduct and scrutinizing his speech,\nI saw that he had deeply penetrated the Mysterious Principle.\nTherefore, I bestowed upon him the name *Juechan* (Paired Toads).\n\nThe character *jue* consists of two jades joined together,\nEnabling the interflow of emptiness and fullness—\nThe great method for preserving form and spirit in their entirety.\nEmptiness is the body of fullness, fullness is the function of emptiness;\nWhen emptiness and fullness interflow, coming and going are unimpeded.\n\nJade also embodies the meaning of purity and whiteness:\nWithin an empty chamber, whiteness arises,\nThe spirit’s dwelling is profoundly settled,\nAnd naturally, the light of Heaven shines forth,\nIlluminating all without partiality.\nWhen the work reaches this point,\nThe tasks of immortals, buddhas, and sages are complete.\n\nHaving spoken thus, I compose this piece to record it.\nThe song goes:",

      "translated_text": "To be immortal, buddha, or Confucian sage—\nThe three teachings transmit but one emptiness.\nFrom ancient times to now, all who transcend\nHave cultivated within this void.\n\nThose who study immortality take emptiness and stillness as the elixir’s core,\nThose who study Buddhism plumb the void in meditation.\nAs for me, learning the sagely way—\nIn emptiness, the self dissolves, and Heaven’s principle shines clear.\n\nThe Dao’s body is an empty vastness, wondrous and boundless,\nHeaven and Earth operate through emptiness, qi harmoniously fuses.\nYin and Yang’s transformations are driven by the void’s ebb and flow;\nIf one delves into emptiness, all becomes fluid and free.\n\nThe marvel of the returning elixir lies in the valley of nothingness—\nBegin by attaining emptiness, steadfastly guard stillness.\nPush emptiness to its extreme, and primordial qi congeals;\nStillness deepened further, yang revives in turn.\n\nAn empty heart and full belly are the Dao’s foundation,\nWhen the numinous void is not obscured, it is time to gather the medicine.\nEmptying the self to respond to the moment is true daily practice,\nOne who embodies the Great Void is a child of the heroic.\n\nGathering lead in emptiness and stillness is effortless action,\nAdvancing the fire uses emptiness as the bellows’ key.\nAll additions and subtractions arise from emptiness,\nShattering the void completes the Great Learning.\n\nUltimately, the Dao is empty yet inexhaustibly active—\nTo resolve entanglements and blunt sharpness, both must be embraced.\nKnowing the light, one blends with the world, forgetting self and others;\nBefore the image of the Lord, only the self knows.\n\nBefore the uncarved, how could there be trigrams?\nQian is not above, Kun is not below.\nAt the center, a single point of utmost emptiness and numinosity,\nEight-sided and flawless, without seam or crack.\n\nThough its four edges are firmly sealed, it pierces the undifferentiated whole—\nThis is the Mysterious Female’s gate of central emptiness.\nIf one seeks to employ emptiness without first becoming empty,\nNaturally, opening and closing will align with Heaven and Earth.\n\nWhen the Mysterious Female’s gate opens, the work reaches its peak,\nFrom this the spirit emerges, to this it returns.\nEmerging and entering, it reverts to emptiness—\nSuddenly, a spring thunderclap shakes the earth.\n\nWhen the thunderclap resounds, Heaven and Earth part,\nFrom the void bursts forth a perfect wheel of light.\nRound and full, its radiance vast,\nLacking nothing, excess nothing, it illumines all equally.\n\nThis master of the bamboo’s uprightness is extraordinary—\nGrasp it subtly to respond to all things in season.\nWithin emptiness, settle the spirit; within emptiness, act.\nIn speech, reveal the void’s subtle workings.\n\nWhen emptiness reaches its ultimate, all errors cease,\nAbiding in emptiness, Heaven and Earth return in full.\nThe hollow-hearted, straight-stemmed green bamboo—\nThis is the foremost mechanism of refining emptiness.\n\n*Song of Breaking Delusion*\n\nAlas for the gold elixir seekers of the world,\nTheir methods diverge, their cinnabar varies endlessly.\nClinging to images, mired in texts, what can they achieve?\nPlucking leaves, chasing branches—all in vain.\n\nThey gather the sun’s essence, absorb the moon’s radiance,\nContain light, ingest qi, and swallow mist.\nCrouching and stretching, they busy themselves needlessly,\nRolling their eyes, pinching their lids, conjuring empty flowers.\n\nThey refine thick saliva, swallow fluids,\nPress the tailbone, clench the spine.\nVisualizing, contemplating, gazing at the tip of the nose,\nThey churn seas and overturn oceans, consuming filth.\n\nThey guard blandness, sink into dull emptiness,\nStupefied and dazed, they rush through their practice.\nSome add massage and breath-counting—\nAll far removed from the principle of the gold elixir.\n\nEight Brocades, Six Healing Sounds,\nFasting and grain-avoidance—what do these accomplish?\nClinging to the Three Peaks, they study yin-cultivation,\nNine shallow thrusts, one deep—such is their advance and retreat.\n\nThey stir the waist, cup the kidneys, guard the Gate of Life,\nBend and stretch, guide and lead, playing with essence and spirit.\nFacing the furnace, consuming milk, mimicking military strategy—\nSuch family traditions are not worth discussing.\n\nSome practice turtle-retraction and breath-holding,\nBear-stretching and crow-flying—all futile labor.\nThe \"Rubbing Waist Layman\" warms his belly,\nThe \"Qi-Circulating Master\" reddens his face.\n\nThey strike the Heavenly Drum, embrace Kunlun,\nKnock their teeth, gather their spirit, gaze at the crown.\nHearing echoes, they mistake them for a roaring tiger,\nWhen their bellies gurgle, they claim it is the female dragon’s song.\n\nThey burn the cinnabar field, chant over boiling seas,\nSleepless day and night, enduring bitter trials.\nBarefoot and in thin clothes, they suffer torment,\nRepaying debts of hunger and cold from past lives.\n\nConstantly maintaining silence is but futile effort,\nSilently worshipping the Emperor—how can one ascend?\nExhaling into their hands, clutching their bags—true vulgar lords,\nRubbing their urine—how mad and deranged.\n\nThey wield the golden spear, draw from the golden well,\nUsing beautiful women as their medicine crucibles.\nThey gather others’ essence and blood, calling it true lead,\nLosing their primordial harmony, yet still unaware.\n\nSome spout Chan like tangled vines,\nWagging their tongues, showing off their eloquence.\nPointing to emptiness, expounding on emptiness, they brawl,\nRaising fists, thrusting fingers—ignorant of the source.\n\nThey raise \"critical phrases,\" observe methods,\nWielding quick wit and sharp repartee, clamoring over texts.\nBrandishing hammers, flourishing whisk brooms, they recruit disciples,\nBlinking their eyes, raising their brows—this is their \"transmission.\"\n\nStudying cases, pursuing Chan,\nTrue high monks would never act thus.\nMany paths to reason are called wisdom,\nBut \"seeing the nature\" must wait for the donkey’s year.\n\nDaoists, Confucians, Buddhists—abandon your clinging,\nTurn the light inward, reflect, and measure yourself.\nSuddenly, you touch the tip of your nose—\nOnly then will you realize all that came before was wrong.\n\nStudents of immortality, cease your chatter,\nTrace the breath’s origin to its root.\nDiscard all forms and seeking,\nAvoid even the formless and imageless.\n\nThe heart is not fire, the kidneys are not water,\nOrdinary essence cannot be called Heavenly Water.\nThe Yellow Dame is not in the spleen,\nThe Mysterious Female is not in the mouth or nose.\n\nMao is not the rabbit, You is not the rooster,\nZi is not Kan, Wu is not Li.\nThe First, Second, Third, and Fourth are not in the intestines,\nHolding to fullness—why cling to the moon’s fullness?\n\nThe liver is not the dragon, the lungs are not the tiger,\nHow can essence and radiance be called the elixir’s mother?\nThe Five Phases are but one Yin and Yang,\nThe Four Images do not depart from the Two Mysterious Females.\n\nThe source of the medicine’s river is not easily known,\nMercury arises in the East, lead in the West.\nThe sun’s soul in the Li position is the Alchemical Girl,\nThe moon’s spirit in the Kan palace is the Infant Boy.\n\nAct without acting, learn without learning,\nPratyeka-buddhas and Sravakas all rely on this.\nI now reveal the entire mechanism in one phrase:\nBody and mind are both fire and medicine.\n\nWhen body and mind are settled, the mysterious aperture opens,\nEssence, qi, and spirit naturally merge in emptiness.\nAfter three hundred days, the fetal spirit sheds its husk,\nTurning the body, it shatters the Great Void.\n\n*Two Songs of the Mysterious Principle*\n\nThough the Supreme Dao has no fixed abode,\nIt still relies on a master to transmit its rules.\nZhun and Meng take their images from dawn and dusk,\nFu and Gou borrow winter and summer, calling them Zi and Wu.\n\nAdvance the fire within nothingness to refine the Great Elixir,\nSet the furnace and stabilize the cauldron to seek true earth.\nBody, mind, and intent—three households united,\nLead, mercury, silver, and cinnabar share one origin.\n\nAdditions and subtractions follow the poem’s order,\nGuarding the city, I distinguish host and guest.",

      "translated_text": "Turning inward to seek, this is the nature of one’s feelings and essence;\nTransforming and cultivating them, this is body and mind, soul and spirit, essence and qi.\nExtending and practicing this, it is the gate of the Mysterious Female, the mechanism of opening and closing.\n\nThe *Taishang* says: \"The valley spirit does not die—this is called the Mysterious Female. The gate of the Mysterious Female is called the root of Heaven and Earth.\" Subtly continuous, as if present—its use is inexhaustible.\n\nThe *Yi* says: \"Closing the door is called Kun; opening the door is called Qian. One closing and one opening is called change; ceaseless coming and going is called penetration.\"\n\nThe *Elixir Scripture* says: \"Exhaling connects to the root of Heaven; inhaling connects to the root of Earth—this is the mechanism of Qian and Kun’s opening and closing. Exhaling, the dragon hums and clouds arise; inhaling, the tiger roars and wind is born—this is one closing and one opening called change. Wind and clouds respond and unite, transforming to generate the golden liquid—this is ceaseless coming and going called penetration. The golden liquid returns, congealing into the Great Elixir, hence provisionally named the Dragon-Tiger Great Elixir. Gathering and ingesting it, one attains longevity and enduring vision—this so-called breathing is not that of mouth and nose. The true mechanism’s wondrous response is the gate of one emergence and one entry. If you can penetrate this, the Dragon-Tiger Elixir will form, and immortality may be hoped for.\n\nThose who cultivate the truth, if they can thoroughly master and fully penetrate the Dragon and Tiger, though the Way of true constancy is called most profound and subtle, how could they fear failure? As for planting good roots, establishing virtue’s foundation, and nurturing the sacred embryo, none have succeeded without clarifying the Dragon and Tiger.\n\nMaster Ziyang said: \"Gathering body and mind is called subduing the Dragon and Tiger. When the mind is unmoving, the dragon hums; when the body is unmoving, the tiger roars. The dragon’s humming consolidates qi; the tiger’s roaring congeals essence. When primordial essence congeals, it suffices to preserve form; when primordial qi is consolidated, it suffices to concentrate spirit. When form and spirit are both wondrous, they unite with the Dao in truth—thus the immortal’s task is complete. If not one of utmost spirit in the world, who could attain this?\"\n\nZhao Shuzhai, a native of ancient Hangzhou, served as a eunuch in his youth, holding the office of palace attendant. Through the turning of Qian and the revolving of Kun, he saw through the illusions of floating life, thus abandoning profit and renouncing fame to seek the essentials of the Dao. Though he mingled in the red dust, his heart dwelled in the realm of mystery—a true transcender of worldly affairs. Desiring to blend and congeal spirit, he focused his mind on the Dragon and Tiger. One day, he brought this diagram to me, asking for an inscription. I declined, but he insisted, so I took up my brush to fulfill my duty.\n\nI said to him: \"The ancients established images based on the Dao; you now establish words based on images. Zhao Shuzhai, the key lies in sharpening your discernment, observing the teachings’ precision, and not mistaking the fixed pole star. If you can grasp the meaning through words and comprehend the intent through the diagram, you will know that the true Dragon and true Tiger are not on paper but within yourself. When words and images are both forgotten, virtue and the Dao are complete.\"\n\nAh! The true Dragon and true Tiger are not hard to find—just draw forth yang to supplement yin. With the Four Virtues circulating Qian without cease, hidden flight and manifest leaping are all at the heart’s command. Though it begins on level ground, it surges like waves in the blue sky, resounding like thunder.\n\nStrive on, strive on!\n\n*Song:*\n...",

non-being, nor to the axis of zi and wu.\nDo not confuse the two and swallow them whole;\nsimply reverse the count of the Five Phases.\nRoot and sprout dwell in the Palace of Great Mystery,\nwhile creation unfolds in the Crimson Numinous Treasury.\nThough their operation has a guiding principle,\nin truth, the numinous void has no fixed abode.\nA single great Dao demands the heart’s penetration;\na trace of divine mechanism is not seen by the eye.\nSuddenly, the crown gate opens—\nyou discern that Wood and Metal share one mother.\nLofty, beyond the highest peak, the Big Dipper’s handle is broken;\nbright, the Silver River’s ladle pours forth.\nClouds rise and mists form through Ding’s power;\nlightning flashes and thunder is driven by the Dark Warrior’s might.\nIn an instant, Heaven and Earth unite;\nin a moment, Kan and Li are mended.\nThe Tiger stirs a pure breeze from water’s depths;\nthe Dragon descends sweet rain from fire’s midst.\nThunder moves, rain falls, the

five tigers pierce the Mysterious Pass,\nbut who knows the one Tiger arises from true earth?\nWhen you grasp that Dragon and Tiger are ever in harmony,\nyou will see the Tortoise and Serpent mutually devour and disgorge.\n\nThe sage sets forth images to point to the snare’s trace;\nbeyond images, clear words become mere chatter.\nBeyond words, you must fathom the ancestral intent—\nin truth, the Great Ultimate was originally without mark.\nTo grasp the meaning and forget the image is not yet exceptional;\nonly when meaning too is forgotten do you reach the ultimate norm.\n\nI bow to Zhao Shuzhai, the recluse—\nhaving thoroughly overturned all, his study of the mysteries is complete.\n\n*Song of No-One:*\nThe Dao, fundamentally formless, gives birth to the Great Ultimate;\nthe Great Ultimate transforms, and first there is One.\nOne divides into Two, Two begets Three—\nfrom this arise the Four Images and Five Phases.\nNo-One is the root of Heaven and Earth;\nthe Mysterious Teaching’s One is the gate of all wonders.\nChange begins within the One to unfold creation;\nthe human heart’s One governs the warp of the cosmos.\nHeaven attains One and is clear; Earth attains One and is tranquil;\nvalleys attain it and are full; spirits attain it and are numinous.\nThings attain it and are completed; people attain it and live;\nlords and kings attain it, and the world is upright.\nChan transmits the true Dharma within the One;\nConfucianism opens and closes from the One character.\nLaozi expounded true constancy through the One;\nZengzi’s “only One” is wondrous beyond measure.\nThe Dao has Three Vehicles, Chan five schools—\nyet in the end, a thousand lamps share one light.\nEmbrace the Origin, guard the One, and the Mysterious Aperture opens;\nbe precise, be one, and the Sage’s Teaching is illuminated.\nThe True One of Great Mystery is the Gate of Returning to Life—\nknow that the One is the true constant Dao.\nDo not say that attaining the One completes all things;\nattain the One, hold to the One, and never lose it.\nWhen the One penetrates all, Heaven’s principle is clear—\nyet the myriad methods returning to One are not yet extraordinary.\nAt first, the One and the formless give birth to the myriad existents;\nexistence and non-existence mutually sustain and endure.\nIf you can return the myriad existents to the formless One,\nonly then will you face south and behold the Northern Dipper.\nAt this point, having attained the One, you must forget the One—\nthen you may emerge and submerge with the primordial transformation.\nIf you cling to the One and cannot forget,\nyou are like a foolish cat guarding an empty burrow.\nThe Three and Five merge into One, returning to the void;\nafter returning to the void, the void too vanishes.\nWhen non-void is no more, all is profoundly still—\nthe Western barbarian’s beard and whiskers are gone.\nPeople today call non-being “non-being,”\nwandering in boundless emptiness, treading perilous paths.\nPeople today call the One “the One,”\nstubbornly clinging, wasting effort in vain.\nIf you can grasp the non-being that is not nothingness,\nthen in guarding the One, you will know the One is no-One.\nThe two words “One” and “non-being” are both overturned—\nMaster No-One has completed the great task.\n\n*Song of Embracing the One:*\nThe Non-Ultimate becomes the Great Ultimate;\nthe Great Ultimate spreads its wonders beginning with the One.\nOne divides into Two, giving birth to yin and yang—\nthe myriad kinds and Three Powers arise from this.\nOriginally, the true One is utterly void and numinous,\nunchanging from ancient times to the present.\nOnly because essence takes form and spirit awakens to knowing\ndo the mechanisms of good and evil, causes and conditions, diverge.\nFollowing emotions and chasing illusions, brambles grow thick;\nfragrance, flavor, color, and sound all delude and confuse.\nIf you can investigate the root and origin through the One,\nreturning to the origin and restoring the fundamental requires no effort.\nOne man and one woman unite in the center’s embrace—\nthree daughters and three sons cannot be contained within.\nThe Three Primes and Eight Trigrams meet in ren;\nthe Four Images and Five Phases return to utmost stillness.\nSuddenly, the crown gate is broken open—\nflashing golden light fills the spirit chamber.\nThe valley of the formless naturally opens;\nthe Gate of the Mysterious Female opens and closes of itself.\nThe return of the one yang is wondrous beyond measure;\nthe Four Virtues circulate Qian without cease.\nVast qi congeals the spirit in profound obscurity,\nemerging into existence, entering into non-existence, in the realm of the indistinct.\nWhat is the master within?\nIt is the original possession of the enlightened gentleman.\n\n*Song of the Wisdom Sword:*\nSince the perfected one transmitted the sword’s secret,\nthe true command is fully raised, resolute and decisive.\nIf someone asks me to reveal its trace and origin,\nI say it is no ordinary iron.\nThis lump of iron\nemerges from the kun direction;\nonce it enters my hand, it becomes majestic.\nFiercely refined in fire upon fire,\nthrough a hundredfold refinement, it becomes steel.\n\nYou who study the Dao, know this secret—\nthe yang spirit’s might destroys yin demons.\nIts divine power and wondrous use are truly immeasurable;\nI now lay bare its workings for you.\nI tell you,\nrevealing Heaven’s mechanism:\nbegin when the one yang returns.\nFirst command the six jia to fan the furnace bellows;\nthen the six ding wield the pincers and hammer.\nWhen the firing is complete, the sword is forged—\nat first, it gleams like lightning.\nWielded horizontally, a chilling wind arises;\nplunged upright, a bright moon appears.\nThe bright moon appears,\nradiant light shines—\nflashing to earth, illuminating the sky, gods and ghosts lament.\nIt stirs the turbid and lifts the pure, sweeping away evil and filth,\nslaying dragons, beheading tigers, annihilating serpents and oysters.\nThe six thieves perish, the three corpses are severed—\nties are cut, thoughts cast off, the net of emotions is torn.\nWhere the divine blade points, mountains crumble—\nthe demon kings of the three realms are all destroyed.\nThis precious sword\nis originally formless;\nits divine power forces it to be

Cultivation**\n\n**Initiating the Ninefold Returned Elixir**\nTo begin the ninefold returned elixir’s work,\nknow first the welling spring beneath the mountain’s base.\nThe furnace’s wondrous use relies on Kun’s earth,\nthe fire’s labor draws upon Xun’s wind.\nDui’s tiger and Zhen’s dragon just commingle,\nKan’s boy and Li’s girl then harmonize as one.\nOnce the four images return to center,\nthe mechanism of creation rests in me alone.\n\n**Right: Arousing the Unenlightened**\n\n**Gathering the Medicine**\nRefining mercury and smelting lead—no fixed time,\nthe learner must seek within stillness to discern.\nGuest-dust and desire may taint, yet the heart remains untouched;\nwhen heavenly water first stirs, the spirit knows of itself.\nWith emotions stilled, gold returns to its nature’s root;\nessence congeals, Kan departs to mend southern Li.\nWhen these two numinous things unite,\nyin exhausted and yang pure, the Dao may be attained.\n\n**Right: Gathering the Medicine**\n\n**Advancing the Fire**\nOnce heavenly water begins to flow,\ntrue yang naturally returns in due season.\nSamādhi fire arises from Li’s position,\na thunderclap resounds from Zhen’s palace.\nQi and spirit merge to form a numinous substance,\nheart and breath interdepend to knit the sacred embryo.\nPiercing the inner core’s subtle sign,\nthe three barriers and nine apertures open as one.\n\n**Right: Advancing the Fire**\n\n**Daily Practice**\nTrue lead and true mercury—great elixir’s head,\ngather them where formless form abides.\nActing and striving still bring encumbrance;\nseeking nothing, clinging not, one knows no care.\nEver clear, ever still—the heart’s pearl appears,\nforgetting things, forgetting schemes—the life-treasure circulates.\nIn movement and stillness, no obstruction,\nwhere you stand is Penglai Isle.\n\n**Right: Daily Use**\n\n**Consolidating Form**\nThe Quanzhen’s wondrous principle is not hard to practice,\nonly fear following conditions, chasing sights and sounds.\nMyriad illusions cannot invade when passions cease,\na single heart unstained—thoughts arise in peace.\nBanish self and others to fulfill heaven’s principle,\ngrasp yin and yang to join in supreme harmony.\nI tell the elixir-refining noble ones:\nwhen sights and sounds leak not, nature shines complete.\n\n**Right: Consolidating Form**\n\n**Union**\nThe Dao of true constancy is not at all difficult,\nit lies only in daily use, here and now.\nOne unites Qian and Kun, knowing opening and closing,\nthe two wheels of sun and moon cycle of themselves.\nReturning to the root has its returning aperture,\nrestoring life has its restoring gate.\nTreading the twofold subtle sign,\ntranscending the mundane, surpassing the sacred—ease itself.\n\n**Right: Penetrating the Barrier**\n\n**Entry and Exit**\nThe valley spirit never dies—this is the mysterious female,\nthe very mechanism of Qian and Kun’s opening and closing.\nComing and going without cease,\npushing and surging without fail.\nThe white-haired old master rides the dragon away,\nthe blue-eyed foreign lad mounts the tiger home.\nAsk where the work’s completion is proven—\nthe moon’s light encircles heaven and earth.\n\n**Right: Entry and Exit**\n\n**Admonishing the Multitude**\nMouthing the three mysteries in vain boasting,\nbroad discourse and lofty talk only lead further astray.\nBetter to embody form to seek true reality,\nthan to squeeze the eyes and conjure empty flowers.\nFollowing things leads ever to illusion’s end;\nturning the head around, you arrive home at once.\nDo not fault Qing’an for its blunt speech—\nit pries open the heart’s aperture to leave no veil.\n\n**Right: Admonishing the Multitude**\n\n**Correcting Deviations**\nThree thousand six hundred side doors,\nthose who cling to them grope in darkness within.\nEach day they merely see with the heart’s eye—\nwhen will they awaken to life’s return to the root?\nKeen wit and exceptional talent—what need for the Dao?\nSharp wisdom and deep insight—no cause for discussion.\nAll forms, names, sounds, and appearances—\nin the end, all are but toying with the spirit-soul.\n\n**Right: Correcting Deviations**\n\n**Confronting Demons**\nHow to forbid night’s drowsy stupor?\nGhostly faces and spirit-heads appear—what then?\nDullness and distraction arise from turbid qi,\nthoughts’ discontinuity from excess yin.\nWhen the tide comes, water reaches the shore;\nwhen wind stills, the river’s heart knows no waves.\nWith nature still and passions void, the heart unmoved,\nbirth knows no dullness, sleep knows no demons.\n\n**Right: Confronting Demons**\n\n**Revealing the Correct**\nThe fire-tally is easy, the medicine not forced—\nheavenly water rises like the ocean’s tide.\nKnow to gather the two kinds of mercury and lead,\ncasting off all desires and objects at once.\nOverturning the myriad existences, the three primals unite;\nrefining all yin, the five qi pay homage.\nAfter ten months, the embryo sheds its shell—elixir’s work complete,\nthe infant’s form appears to ascend the divine clouds.\n\n**Right: Revealing the Correct**\n\n**Harmonizing**\nThe great medicine of the three primals—mind, heart, body,\nfixating on mind, heart, body binds one to dust.\nRegulating breath requires regulating the true breath,\nrefining spirit requires refining the spiritless spirit.\nSuddenly forgetting self and others, the three flowers gather,\nfiercely relinquishing conditions, the five qi arrive.\nEightfold open, fourfold unobstructed,\nat all times and places, the Quanzhen is revealed.\n\n**Right: Harmonizing**\n\n**Illuminating the Root**\nThe self arises from emptiness, yet forces a name—\nwith a name, the heart’s affairs become entangled.\nYin and yang wax and wane through past and present,\nsun and moon rise and set, governing death and life.\nIf you can preserve constancy amid the flux,\nyou will know noon’s three watches.\nThough worldly conduct relies on the master’s teaching,\nthe work of transcending the world must be self-realized.\n\n**Right: Illuminating the Root**\n\n**Forging the Sword**\nThe enlightened master teaches me to forge the spirit-blade,\nrelying wholly on yin and yang’s creative power.\nTempering Qian’s hardness, Kun serves as the forge,\nblowing with Li’s fire, Xun becomes the wind.\nCrafting dragon and elephant within the heart’s palace,\nsweeping away demonic vapors with a marshal’s resolve.\nThose who know this art of the Dao’s high adepts\ncasually cleave the vast emptiness itself.\n\n**Right: Forging the Sword**\n\n**The Toad’s Grotto**\nThe toad’s grotto—serene and secluded, the finest realm,\nwhere the master, upside-down, makes his livelihood.\nThe jade furnace smelts the golden liquid,\nthe golden tripod simmers the white numinous sprout.\nTurning the handle of the Dipper to revolve the heavens,\npushing the tally-fire to drive the thunder-chariot.\nOnce all barriers and locks are pierced,\nfreely navigate the Silver River on a sturdy raft.\n\n**Right: The Toad’s Grotto**\n\n**Qing’an Hermitage**\nMy hermitage is no ordinary retreat—\nit does not permit casual visits from the common folk.\nOne wife, one husband can sustain life,\nthree boys, three girls form a perfect circle.\nThe inner world is vast indeed,\nwhile the outer void is not so wide.\nAsk the master what he is about—\nhe replies: \"Face south and behold the Northern Dipper.\"\n\n**Right: Qing’an Hermitage**\n\n**Twelve Poems on True Joy**\n\nBuddhas and immortals are all made by men,\nyet how can they not know they wander lost?\nIf not for chasing fame and striving in calculation,\nthey would surely race after profit, toiling in haste.",

      "translated_text": "Toiling ceaselessly to bear the weight of family,\nhurrying endlessly to provide for wife and child.\nEven if wealth and honor come, and the wife’s beauty shines,\nwhen impermanence arrives, how can they follow you?\nHow much better to embrace the wondrous perfection of the True,\nwhere true joy within the heart is known to none but oneself.\nThe elixir is refined not through refining but in non-refinement,\nthe Dao is enacted not through action but in non-action.\nStill the thoughts, sever the ties to harmonize the ancestral qi,\nforget hearing, forget seeing to nurture the infant within.\nOnce the foundation of the elixir is firmly laid,\nfive-colored radiance pierces through curtains and screens.\nThe furnace employs Kun, the crucible employs Qian,\ndelving into the subtlest principles, one becomes a transcendent.\nIt is nothing but subduing emotions to return to nature,\nwhich is the refining and merging of mercury and lead.\nWhen all scheming ceases, the elixir glows crimson,\nwhen true stillness is preserved, the treasure hardens firm.\nThis is the method of withdrawal and addition—\nno need for anxious questioning of mysteries.\nThe fire-tally is easy, the medicine not distant,\ncreation’s workings are like the great ocean’s tide.\nThe medicine is gathered only from within the void,\nthe fire-elixir burns wholly in stillness.\nNine and three converge, all conditions cease,\ntwo and eight unite, the five qi pay homage.\nWhen yin is exhausted and yang pure, the work is complete—\nthe True Person emerges to pay respects in the divine clouds.\n\nThe elixir is first refined by harmonizing qi and spirit,\nDharma-water is poured to kindle the fire of wisdom.\nThree substances merge, three natures unite,\none yang revives as one yin dissipates.\nThe golden furnace stands upright, a thousand spirits gather,\nthe precious crucible’s work complete, ten thousand images pay homage.\nWhen the medicine is perfected and the elixir formed, the spirit sheds its husk,\nthe numinous body emerges, naked and unadorned.\n\nThe supreme principle of the primordial is wondrous beyond fathoming:\nlead arises in the West, mercury in the East.\nWater and fire divide above and below,\nthe Mysterious Pass lies in the center.\nTo know the unknowable is true knowing,\nto comprehend emptiness is true emptiness.\nThe meaning of being and non-being, of having and not-having—\nlike the sun’s crimson glow at the ocean’s depths.\n\nAbiding in stillness, one accords with the true constant,\ndissolving all yin to restore yang.\nWithin Kun, the Yellow Dame gives birth to the Crimson Child,\nin Li, the Enchanted Maiden weds the Foolish Lad.\nOn the mountain’s peak, water descends and the Yellow Sprout grows,\nbeneath the earth, thunder rumbles and White Snow flies.\nA thousand miles of silver rivers bear not a speck of dust,\nthe Golden Toad alone reveals its divine radiance.\n\nThe bewitching Young Girl burns to wed the Golden Elder,\nall depends on the Yellow Dame’s matchmaking skill.\nOnce the couple meets,\ntheir cloud-and-rain passions unite in harmony.\nAt leisure, they drink together in the Vermilion Mansion,\ndrunk, they sleep side by side in the Purple Ultimate Palace.\nEvening joy, morning fear—such weighty bonds of love,\nin a year’s time, a little child is born.\n\nWithin every person lies a husband and wife,\nyet how foolish and deluded they remain!\nThey do not seek creation within,\nbut instead lay the elixir’s foundation without.\nFalsely taking the Three Peaks’ art of bedroom techniques,\nthey counterfeit the marvel of Xuanyuan’s Nine Tripods.\nSuch bestial acts are hard to repent—\nsoon Lord Yama’s summons will arrive.\n\nThe husband and wife within the body I speak of to you:\na blue-clad maiden and a white-haired elder.\nMetal’s nature and Wood’s essence unite,\nblack mercury and red lead naturally resonate.\nBeneath moon and wind, the spirit roams in bliss,\nclouds drift, rain falls—endless delight.\nIf you truly grasp these principles,\nthe true embryo coalesces as easily as turning a palm.\n\nThe Great Elixir of Nine Returns and Seven Reversions—\nseekers must seek it within stillness.\nIf you grasp this subtle mechanism,\nthe two numinous substances will unite.\nThree years’ creation is completed in an instant,\nnine cycles’ work circles in a moment.\nThen overturn the crucible and furnace—\nthe elixir’s light illuminates the four divine continents.\n\nNo written texts are established for transmission beyond the teachings,\nfor in each person’s portion, the original perfection is already complete.\nThe subtle breeze of the Mysterious gently purifies the three realms,\nthe moon of wisdom shines brightly, imprinting the hundred rivers.\n\nThe Three Gates of Tusita are but metaphors,\nthe single finger of the Heavenly Dragon is no true explanation.\nBeyond the sound of thunder, messages are conveyed—\nthis is not Zhou Dunyi’s Supreme Ultimate circle.\n\n**Four Conditions to Warn the World**\n\nBody, mind, worldly affairs—four empty names,\nhow many deluded souls are ensnared by them?\nCalamity arises only from grasping at power and profit,\nthe wheel of rebirth turns solely for love’s attachments.\nTo pacify the mind, sever all traces from the body’s movements,\nin the world, forget scheming and let things take their course.\nWhen encountering circumstances, always yield and comply—\nthus the foundation of life is eternally firm, and nature perfectly luminous.\n\n**Ode to the Gourd**\n\nThe numinous sprout’s seed is born of the primordial,\nits stem firm, roots deep—such is the principle of nature.\nDaily, it is nurtured with earth from Kun’s position,\ntimely, it is watered with springs from Kan’s midst.\nIts blossoms open like white jade, radiant and lustrous,\nits seeds form like yellow gold, round and firm.\nWhen the work is complete, a single aperture opens atop—\nwithin, a distinct Qian and Kun are revealed.\n\n**The Heart-Mirror**\n\nGather Qian’s ore into Kun’s furnace,\nthe six directions and empty space become one mold.\nWhen the Dharma-image is formed, it shines resplendent,\nwhere mercury is polished, it gleams like jade.\nIts radiance extends throughout the three thousand worlds,\nits gathering returns to a single millet-grain pearl.\nLift it clearly, and the whole body appears—\nyet one must shatter it to unite with the original pivot.\n\n**For Fuan Hermitage: Pointing to the Mysterious Female**\n\nThe Mysterious Gate’s female portal is not hard to know—\ngather body and mind, and turn inward.\nWhen you grasp the principle of the Two Modes’ ebb and flow,\nyou will understand the qi’s coming and going.\nQian and Kun open and close without cease,\nLi and Kan rise and sink, unite and part.\nFor Fuan Hermitage, I clearly point this out—\nwhere thoughts return, the elixir’s foundation is laid.\n\n**Matching the Rhymes of Weng’s Learning Record**\n\nHidden meanings probe the *Cantong Qi* with White Jade Toad,\nonly by exhausting principles does one become a transcendent.\nBefore the Supreme Ultimate gives rise to the Three and Five,\none vainly treads the eight thousand leagues to Penglai.\nThe Śākya family’s tradition relies on the ancestral seal,\nthe Fuxi lineage’s Dao must be transmitted heart-to-heart.\nThe jade terrace’s moon alone shines in the azure sky,\nimprinting a thousand pools with the same perfect roundness.\n\n**For Deng Yichan**\n\nChan, Confucianism, and the Perfect Real—\nteachings establish three gates to guide later generations.\nŚākya’s tradition stores emptiness, one must see nature,\nConfucian scholars investigate things, they must preserve sincerity.\nThe Elixir Terrace retains a spark of fire,\nthe numinous palace melts away all dust.\nWhen you grasp that the myriad differences return to one,\nwithin and beyond the Terrace of Joy, spring reigns everywhere.\n\n**Seven Poems on Self-Attainment**\n\nShatter the vast chaos’ aperture—\nno Buddhas, no immortals remain.\nIt is neither a marvel beyond the heart,\nnor a Chan phrase on the lips.\nDays pass in carefree ease,\nnights in unrestrained sleep.\nEntrusting the body to the hidden, absolute realm,\nall things are left to Heaven.\n\nAll conditioned dharmas,\nevery one, are but dust.",

Zhi-yi*\n\n**I**\nTo meet true transmission is to know where to begin—\nsuccess is not difficult.\nWait for the moment *gui* is born:\ndraw forth lead, add mercury,\nfire must not be too dry,\nwater must not be allowed to chill.\nStir the *xun* wind,\nfan open the furnace-bellows—\nmartial refinement and literary simmering are no trifling matter.\nWithin the golden crucible,\nthose two numinous substances\nare forged into an elixir pellet.\nFirst, you must shatter the web of doubt,\nthen penetrate the barrier of returning to the root and reviving life.\nLet the Red Child ride the dragon,\nfetch water from the Palace of *Li*;\nlet the Metal Lord mount the tiger,\ncirculate fire to scorch the mountain.\nThe Metal Lord remains silent,\nthe Enchanted Maiden gathers her sleeves—\nin a single hour, the elixir is wrought.\nSwallow it whole,\nand you will attain the adamantine indestructibility,\ntranscending the human realm.\n\n**II**\nDwelling in the Mystery Gate,\nwithout encountering a true master,\nyou labor in vain.\nIf you sever learning and non-action,\nhow can you know opening and closing?\nWith much learning and wide knowledge,\nhow can you escape the dust of roots and dust?\nClinging to the natural,\nyou end in annihilation—\nclinging to being or non-being, neither is real.\nAll is false—\nwhere is the subtlety in those stars?\nSeek out a master of the highest order.\n\n**III**\nA single word breaks open the primordial cause,\npointing straight to the essence of the elixir head—\n*jing*, *qi*, and *shen*.\nAsk where the Mysterious Pass lies:\nit has no fixed location.\nThe two numinous substances\nreside only in heart and body.\nMovement and stillness interdepend,\nbeing and non-being interpenetrate—\nthe five *qi* return to the origin, and myriad virtues gather.\nIn the profound and wondrous place,\ncluster the One Origin\ninto a single hour.\n\n**IV**\nThe Dao speaks of the Five Phases,\nBuddhism of the Five Eyes,\nConfucianism of the Five Constants.\nMoreover, benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom—\ntrust is their root;\nmetal, wood, water, fire—\nearth abides at the center.\nWhite Tiger, Azure Dragon,\nDark Turtle, Vermilion Bird—\nall emerge from the Five Lords of the Celestial Hook.\nThe celestial number is five;\nthe human spirit, *hun*, *po*,\nand intent belong to the Central Yellow.\nHeaven and Earth reveal the two fives in full—\nwhen the three and five unite,\nthe marvel of returning to the origin is beyond measure.\nFire, two, in the south;\neast, three, makes five;\nnorth, the Mysterious True One;\nwest, four, is its kin.\nThe five earths of the central palace,\ncombined into three and five—\nthree and five merge, yin returns to yang.\nThe adept of the Mysterious,\nwith lead, silver, cinnabar, mercury,\nrefines them into adamantine gold.\n\n**V**\nThe Dao is fundamentally empty and formless,\nthe formless gives birth to the One,\nthe One and Two become Three.\nFrom Three, the myriad things are born—\nall things are transformed by emptiness,\nform after form is transmitted,\nthing after thing interpenetrates.\nEach body is fundamentally empty,\neach head is originally One—\nthis is not to be discussed casually by ordinary people.\nThe wonder of emptiness and formlessness\npossesses form, name, and appearance,\nencompassed within the empty.\nDelve deeply into the secret meaning within emptiness—\nto reach the ultimate emptiness,\ninquire of Lao Dan.\nThat empty and quiescent stillness,\nthe ultimate within the non-existent;\nemptiness and formlessness thoroughly realized,\npiercing the teachings of Gautama.\nBefore the Emperor of Images,\nbeyond the Shore of Thunderous Sound—\nwho else but the pure, empty, and formless?\nAll the hosts of the Mysterious,\nthrough emptiness and formlessness, meet the Dao—\nbowing in reverence, they pay homage.\n\n**VI**\nWho clasps hands?\nWho joins palms?\nWho raises a fist?\nThese mere tricks—\npeople still misunderstand them.\nThe wondrous principle of non-action—\nwho truly grasps and upholds it?\nFor all of you,\nI clearly set forth:\nLaozi, Gautama, and Confucius are one.\nPonder past and present—\nthe thousand worthies and ten thousand sages\nare all the work of human hands.\nPitiful are later learners, devoid of knowledge—\ndistinguishing right from wrong,\ntrue from false, has no end.\nMoreover, heaven, earth, and humanity\nshare a single source, divided in response;\nDaoists, Confucians, and Buddhists—\none principle, what doubt is there?\nSeeing nature and illuminating the heart,\nprobing the subtle and reaching life’s end—\nto be a Buddha or an immortal lies only in this.\nAfter the work is accomplished,\nthough paths differ and schools diverge,\nin the end, they all return to the same.\n\n**VII**\nI tell you, learners:\nfire has no weight,\ntiming has no hexagrams or lines.\nThere is no drawing forth or adding,\nno action to be taken—\nno form or image,\nno need for refinement or firing.\nEach is unreal,\nall is false—\nto labor with intent is but vain toil.\nDo you understand?\nAll sounds and sights\nare but confusion and delusion.\nCast aside seeing, hearing, knowing, and awareness—\nstrike through to the numinous terrace, leaving not a single hair.\nNo more talk of furnaces and hearths,\nno seeking of medicinal substances.\nThe numinous remains undimmed,\nthe will and power firm and steadfast.\nThe spirit-chamber is empty and at ease,\nthe numinous source clear and still—\nwithin it, naturally, heaven and earth commune.\nThose who attain perfection—\nif they do not perfect their true nature,\nhow can they escape the kalpas’ turning?\n\n**VIII**\n*Oral Instructions for Jing’an*\nThe primordial spirit spanning kalpas,\nthe ancestral *qi* from the beginningless,\nthe primordial essence of the Great Origin—\nthese three supreme treasures\nshare a single root and stem.\nIf you seek the truth,\ndo not cling to bodily form.\nCalm the breath, settle the spirit,\nabide in emptiness, solidify the *qi*—\nin purity and non-action, essence naturally congeals.\nThe elixir head forms,\ncirculate the fire of yin-yang symbols,\ngently harmonizing.\nAbove all, secure and sustain fullness—\nrefine lead, mercury,\nsilver, and cinnabar together.\nThe Four Images harmonize,\nthe foundation of life is eternally firm;\nthe Three Origins converge,\nawakened nature is empty and numinous.\nNature and life both perfected,\nform and spirit both wondrous—\nuniting with the Dao,

      "translated_text": "Moreover, to grind down sharpness and resolve entanglements, to dismiss cunning and set aside cleverness—\noverturning self and other, yet leaving no trace of mechanism or restraint.\nResolve stands in emptiness, the mind abides in primordial chaos,\nprobing the hidden intent before the image of the Lord.\nIn the depths of the profound—\nthe old master’s original surname,\none thread through the three.\nOnce he joined the loftiest adepts in arcane discourse,\nthus in silence, in darkness, he merged with Lao Dan.\nHow much more in the numinous realm of emptiness and leisure,\nthe zenith of Chan, serene and still—\nforgetting knowledge, forgetting perception,\nno north, no south.\nGathering in body and mind,\nfusing with the workings of creation,\nall within is overturned to form a sanctuary.\nWhen the divine elixir is complete,\nbehold its perfect roundness,\nilluminating the Song Hermitage.\n\n**Exhortation to Zhong’an on the Wondrous Use of Holding the Center**\nThe center is the Confucian lineage,\nthe center is the Daoist root,\nthe center is the Chan mechanism.\nOf the three teachings’ family ways,\nthe center is the swiftest path;\nof the five constants and hundred practices,\nthe center establishes the foundation.\nIn movement and stillness, attain the center,\nhold fast to the center without wavering—\nthen peer into the subtleties within the center.\nWithin its essence lies the delight,\nrevealed in words—\nbeware of doubt.\nDo you yet know the workings of this center?\nIt lies neither in the midst nor the four directions.\nIn daily life’s plainness,\nthrough the center it operates;\nin rising, dwelling, eating, and drinking,\nall is enacted within the center.\nPenetrate this center,\nand you grasp the center’s body—\nthe character \"center\" originally admits no opposition.\nWhen the center is fully realized,\nsplit it open with the center—\nonly then are you a true man.\n\n**For Abbot Yuan of the Round Hermitage**\nThe human heart is perilous,\nthe heart of Dao is subtle,\nwithin the center lies the mechanism of transformation.\nWhere is its wondrousness?\nIt arises from no contrivance,\nluminous and unobscured,\nthe radiance of wisdom’s moon.\nWhether called *qi* or spirit,\nwhether refined or unified,\nlike jade without flaw, heaven and earth return to it.\nIn the realm of the profound,\ntake the single stroke within Kan,\nand move it into Li of the South.\nThe red dragon coils around the black turtle,\nin the sixth month, frost bears strange fruit.\nThat white-haired old man\ncomes to wed the plain maiden;\nwhen the fetal immortal’s dance concludes,\nthey enter the yellow curtain together.\nClouds bring rain, winds carry harmony,\nyin and yang flow in accord—\na year’s effort nurtures the child.\nConstantly nurture it,\nawaiting the Jade Emperor’s decree,\nthen ascend on clouds to return.\n\n**Exhortation to All Disciples**\nThe Dao resides in ordinary people,\nin the midst of daily use—\nyet people remain unaware.\nAlas, amidst the tangled web of perceptions,\nthe surging red dust,\nthe spirit’s source is unsettled,\nthe moon of the heart lacks radiance.\nThe mountain of self and other looms high,\nthe sea of right and wrong stretches wide—\noverturn all, and you approach the subtle.\nAll you noble ones,\nhear the parable of the Clear Hermitage—\nbeware of doubt.\nFirst take purity as the foundation,\nuse stillness and stability\nas the hermitage’s self-sustaining abode.\nLet the center be the gate,\nrectitude the forest and couch,\nsincerity the path,\nreverence the fence.\nBe humble and yielding with others,\nmodest and respectful in dealings—\nin eating, dwelling, rising, and resting, do not transgress.\nPractice this constantly,\nand if your effort never slackens,\nyou will enter non-action directly.\n\n**To the Tune *Man Jiang Hong*: For Xu’an**\nIn daily practice,\nonly one flavor—\nembrace emptiness, hold to simplicity.\nWhen diverse paths converge as one,\na hundred thoughts unite in singularity.\nIn the Purple Pole Palace, the primal *qi* breathes;\nwithin the suspended crucible, the three flowers gather.\nAsk how to tend the furnace, establish the crucible—\ncast with the metal of Qian.\nBind the golden crow,\nseize the jade hare,\ncapture them,\nseal them in the earthen cauldron.\nIn the firing’s ebb and flow,\ntake greater care in guarding.\nWhen the jade treasure is perfectly formed, it shines in entry and exit;\nthe Dharma-body’s form leaves no trace of coming or going.\nThen conceal yourself,\nascend directly to the Great Clarity Palace—\nthe spirit abides eternally.\n\n**In Praise of Shui’an, Steward Yin**\nWho is the hermitage’s child?\nWho stands within,\nupholding the hermitage?\nSeeing hunger come, he eats—\nwho knows the sweet and bitter?\nThe notes of horn and zither—who discerns them?\nThe hues of blue, yellow, black, and white—who can perceive them?\nIn the ordinary exchanges of daily life,\nwho makes the distinctions?\nWho walks?\nWho lifts?\nWho is silent?\nWho speaks?\nPenetrate these,\nand you know host and guest.\nThe outer form—who fashions it?\nThe inner gate—who comes and goes?\nIn non-action’s end,\nwho ultimately dwells in the hermitage,\nthe Scarlet Mound Palace?\n\n**Instructions for Jue’an**\nThe Dao is fundamentally natural—\nbut to act is error at every turn.\nIf you merely discourse on emptiness,\nhow can you grasp it?\nTo forget both being and non-being never concludes;\nto employ both sides is to be ensnared.\nNothing compares to silently guarding the center—\nthe spirit at ease, joyful.\nPast affairs—\nforget them.\nFuture matters—\ndo not ponder.\nIn the present’s work,\ndo not cling.\nThe six desires do not arise, the three poisons are extinguished;\nwhen the single yang returns, the host of yin is stripped away.\nAwaken to true emptiness,\nembrace the root and return to original emptiness—\nthis is true awakening.\n\n**For Magistrate Ding: The Three Teachings Share One Principle**\nThe three teachings’ true transmission—\nthis path,\noriginally so direct.\nAsk of Laozi’s mechanism—\nultimate emptiness, utmost stillness.\nThe Buddha’s nature is awakened within emptiness;\nConfucius’ principle enters through sincerity.\nFrom the beginning, though the teachings branched into three,\ntheir source is one.\nThe Dao’s mysterious gate\nconstantly responds to things.\nThe *Yi*’s subtleties\nmust be silently grasped.\nThe Chan school’s profound essence—\ntrue emptiness, utmost quiescence.\nMoment by moment, uphold it without interruption;\nlifetimes of use know no end.\nThen return to the root,\nrestore life to the body of original emptiness—\nconcealed in utmost secrecy.\n\n**For Li the Sleeping Daoist Judge**\nA fine sleeping family tradition—\nanother kind of\nsleeping samadhi.\nAs long as the heart is sincere in sleep,\nthe mind is clarified within sleep.\nOnce the method of sleep is mastered,\nwithin sleep you harmonize spirit and *qi*.\nThis sleeping practice—\nits subtleties in peaceful Chan—\nfew understand.\nThough the body sleeps,\nthe nature is not obscured;\nthough the eyes droop,\nthe inner vision is not closed.\nIn deep sleep,\nsteady and secure—\na pillow of cool breeze chills the bones,\ndreaming beyond the world in carefree play.\nUpon waking,\nthe body rests in the Palace of Broad Cold,\nembracing the toad in slumber.\n\n**In Praise of Layman Fu of the Round Hermitage**\nThis circle,\nsince time immemorial,\nhas borne no form.\nMoreover, upright and proper,\npoised and balanced—\nentering the finest dust, it leaves no shadow;\nencompassing the cosmos, it finds no place to rest.",

sings,\nhusband and wife unite,\nand within the crucible, the elixir’s head takes form.\nYet to have a body beyond the body is still not the ultimate—\nonly through sudden perfection can one attain thorough comprehension.\nLush yellow blossoms,\nverdant green bamboo—\nthis principle is not easily divulged.\nFor you, I raise it as an example:\nscooping the bright moon from the water.\n\n---\n\n**To Chen Zhigan**\nIn cultivating the Dao and longing for truth,\ndelight in clarity and emptiness,\nfreely and blissfully abiding in stillness.\nWealth, honor, and glory—none are

penetrated,\nsudden awakening is neither mind nor Buddha.\nDualities of thought forgotten,\nbeing and non-being intermingle,\nand the embryo prepares for the primordial spirit to emerge.\nThe eyes open wide,\nradiance pervades boundlessly.\n\n---\n\n**To Scholar Hu**\nFrom the beginning, a single point,\nluminous and thus—\nwithout form, without shape, without substance.\nUnmoving, unshaken,

Heaven.\n\n---\n\n**To the Tune of \"Moon over the West River\": To Daoist Pan**\nTrue earth, true lead, true mercury,\nprimordial spirit, primordial qi, primordial essence.\nWhen the three

      "translated_text": "The Buddhist scriptures say: \"If one wishes to fully understand all buddhas of the three times, one should contemplate the nature of the dharma-realm—all is created by the mind.\" This means that where there is creation, there is transformation, and both creation and transformation arise from the mind. People commonly say that the creator of the myriad things is the artisan of creation. I alone hold otherwise. Creation fundamentally has no artisan; the myriad things create and transform themselves. Why? Because all things possess this mind, and where this mind exists, there is creation and transformation—is this not self-creation and self-transformation?\n\nMoreover, all forms in the world arise from non-being into being—this is called *creation*. Once born, they must perish; perishing, they return to non-being—this is called *transformation*. Creation and transformation in endless succession are the constant nature of things. The true nature of the One Reality is originally present, existing without form, and thus without creation or transformation—this is the constant Way. People only recognize the absence of creation and transformation as non-creation, failing to see that the great creation abides therein. Who but the enlightened can comprehend this?\n\nThe enlightened, with wisdom all-pervading, perceive all things as empty, return the mind to stillness, and abide in solitary transcendence—thus they are beyond creation and transformation. Those who lack enlightenment cling outwardly to body, mind, and worldly affairs, and inwardly dwell in sensation, perception, volition, and consciousness. Thus they follow the world’s vicissitudes and the cycle of birth and death.\n\nWhat the eye sees is called *form*. Its reception in the mind is called *sensation*. Once received, it becomes *perception*. Perception unceasing leads to *volition*. Volition, whether good or evil, yields corresponding *karmic consciousness*. The ceaseless flux of karmic consciousness is the root of rebirth—thus one cannot escape creation and transformation. If one is not entangled by illusory conditions, not defiled by sense-dust, not obstructed by deluded emotions, not afflicted by craving and desire, then one can perceive the emptiness of the five aggregates. With the five aggregates empty, where is creation and transformation? This is the wondrous mind of nirvana.\n\nI say that creation and transformation arise from the mind—what doubt remains?\n\nThe Daoist texts say: \"Being and non-being produce each other.\" This means that non-being generates being—creation—and being generates non-being—transformation. They also say: \"Attain utmost emptiness, guard absolute stillness; while the myriad things arise together, I observe their return.\" This is to observe the return and know transformation. Knowing transformation, one is no longer transformed; without transformation, how can there be creation? Who but one of unimpeded insight can attain this?\n\nThose of penetrating vision, pure and luminous, can discern the illusory nature of body, mind, and worldly affairs. Within the illusory, what has form is called a thing; when things reach their extreme, they revert, reflecting back into the illusory. One who contemplates thus knows that the formless form is the true form. Nurturing the formless, form endures; preserving the formless, the body remains whole and true. In perfect purity and wholeness, one merges with the great square, vast and boundless, transcending the void—this is beyond creation and transformation.\n\nThose who cling, unsettled in body and mind, assailed by thoughts, lose the formless and scatter the formless body, thus drifting in the cycle of birth and death, forever sinking in the sea of suffering. If one gathers in body and mind, dispels thoughts, prevents the inner from leaking outward and the outer from intruding inward, achieving inner and outer purity, this is called *illumination*. When one forgets the mind within and the body without, the One Reality shines clearly, like the vastness of empty space, unimpeded by creation and transformation—what then remains?\n\nThe Confucian texts say: \"Neither envious nor covetous, free from blame and praise.\" This means that without envy or desire, one does not undergo creation; without blame or praise, one does not undergo transformation. The *Book of Changes* says: \"Look afar to things, and near to oneself.\" I say: looking afar to things, one knows all conditions are illusory; looking near to oneself, one knows the five aggregates are empty. Externally, one screens off all conditions; internally, one dissolves the five aggregates—thus one accords with heaven’s workings and delights in the celestial.\n\nKnowing the beginning and end of things, the causes of the hidden and manifest, the principles of life and death, one exhausts principle and fulfills nature, reaching destiny. Delighting in heaven, one is free from sorrow; fulfilling nature, one is free from doubt. Who but one who attains knowledge can reach this? One who attains knowledge is sincere, luminous, still, and settled—thus one knows that ceaseless birth and death belong to illusory form; inequality and discord arise from the deluded mind; impermanence and change pertain to the times; decay and ruin are the fate of affairs. Through refined observation and practice, this is called *sagehood*; unified in one principle, one is beyond creation and transformation.\n\nWithout attaining knowledge, one cannot investigate things; failing to investigate things, one is swayed by their changes—where then is nature and destiny? If one is not fixed but circulates through the six directions, then heaven and earth unite with me, and the myriad things are complete in me. When one again perceives the heart of heaven and all things return to the One Non-being, creation and transformation cease.\n\nFor example, if heaven and earth did not move, if the sun and moon did not revolve, what would become of the six lines? Without the six lines interacting and reconfiguring, without yin and yang ascending and descending, what would become of the myriad things? The essence of heaven and earth is pure and undivided, unchanging in inversion or uprightness—thus there is no creation or transformation. To create the creationless is the great creation; to transform the transformationless is the great transformation. One who sees thus knows that all things in the world are temporary combinations, and the workings of yin and yang are nothing but illusion. Who but the most profoundly adaptable can match this?\n\nFrom this perspective, the Three Teachings are but the mind; creation arises from the mind, and transcending creation also arises from the mind. The essence of Buddhist practice lies in seeing one’s nature. To see one’s nature, one must first resolve with unwavering determination to overcome habitual energies, and with disciplined effort, preserve the luminous clarity within. Only then can one illuminate and break through all illusions, the mind not clinging to things, thoughts not following emotions.",

      "translated_text": "Thought is the root of affliction; the mind is the seed of dharmic dust. When thought arises, all afflictions arise; when thought ceases, all afflictions cease. When the mind arises, all dharmas arise; when the mind is extinguished, all dharmas are extinguished. The arising and cessation of thought depend entirely on one’s own mind. When birth-and-death are extinguished, and quiescent extinction becomes bliss, this is seeing one’s nature.\n\nToday’s learners fail to see their nature because they are obstructed by the two hindrances of principle and phenomena. Without great insight, one cannot dissolve the hindrance of principle; without great cessation, one cannot remove the hindrance of phenomena. Great insight means wisdom and severance; great cessation means power and restraint. When wisdom and severance are pure and mature, all principles become empty; when power and restraint are pure and mature, all phenomena become empty. Comprehending the great emptiness of the three emptinesses, and knowing the supreme truth of the one true reality—this is the ultimate of great insight. At that moment, body, mind, worldly affairs, thoughts, emotions, and consciousness all cease together—this is the ultimate of great cessation. Without the highest wisdom, who can attain this?\n\nThe essence of Daoist practice lies in preserving one’s nature. To preserve one’s nature, one must first wield the sword of wisdom to slay the hordes of demons and use the fire talisman to dissolve the six desires. Next, with the power of concentration, one forgets emotions and cuts off thoughts, releases burdens and purifies the mind. When the mind is purified, burdens are released, thoughts are cut off, and emotions are forgotten—this is preserving one’s nature. Once true nature is preserved, there is no creation. Today’s learners are seized by emotions and consciousness. To eliminate emotions and consciousness, one must first remove the mind of birth-and-death. When the mind is free from birth-and-death, the body is free from birth-and-death—this is stability. To remove the mind of birth-and-death, one must cultivate the habit of no-thought until it is pure and mature, sufficient to attain dreamlessness. When the stillness and stability of no-thought are pure and mature, one can attain birthlessness. Dreamlessness is the great matter of the present; no-thought is the great matter of the end. Birthlessness means no creation; dreamlessness means no transformation. Without creation or transformation, there is no birth or death. Without the most exalted of beings, who can attain this?\n\nThe essence of Confucian learning lies in fully realizing one’s nature. To fully realize one’s nature, one must illuminate the luminous virtue and rest at the highest good. Knowing where to rest, one then attains stability; with stability, one can forget both self and others. The *Yijing* says in the *Gen* hexagram: *\"Stopping at the back, one does not obtain the body; walking in the courtyard, one does not see others—no blame.\"* Stopping at the back means forgetting the mind; not obtaining the body means forgetting the self; walking in the courtyard without seeing others means forgetting things. When these three are forgotten, what blame can there be? This is the ultimate of knowing where to rest. Knowing where to rest, one can forget self and others and fully embody heavenly principle—this is fully realizing one’s nature.\n\nToday’s people cannot fully realize their nature because they are burdened by body and mind. With burdens come obstructions; one must be resolute and decisive. Resoluteness enables one to forget things; decisiveness enables one to forget the self. When both self and things are forgotten, one fully realizes one’s nature and stabilizes one’s destiny. Without divine virtue and sagely merit, who can attain this?\n\nI see that most people regard this body as having a self—how profoundly they fail to reflect! This body exists because of creation; before creation, was there form? Was there name? Was there a self? After transformation, will there be form? Name? A self? Both before and after, there is nothing—how can one stubbornly cling to a self in the middle? They do not realize that body, mind, and worldly affairs are fundamentally illusory; tracing them through the three times, nothing can be found. The past is utterly gone—where is it? The present changes with every thought. The future will certainly be the same. Through kalpas of time, in this great dream and illusion, stubbornly clinging to false conditions, one accumulates the seeds of samsara, thus entering birth and death without end.\n\nIf there is someone in this dreamlike realm who awakens, understands, and skillfully navigates it, is this not a supreme person? One day, I presented this koan to my disciples for contemplation. Two or three of them somewhat grasped its essence, so I wrote this text to bestow upon them, transmitting mind with mind. If one can directly accept and silently comprehend it, instantly knowing where to rest, without scheming for the future or worrying about the past, without clinging to the present—when these three merge into one, one attains great freedom. Roaming in the ocean of great quiescent extinction, wandering in the realm of nothingness, swimming in the field of self-attainment—only then does one realize that creation has nothing to do with this.\n\nYet there is still something beyond. What is this \"something beyond\"? Hmph! Overturn the foot of the wordless, shatter the great void—only then is one a true man of the Way. Keep this secret, keep it secret.\n\n**On the \"No-Learning Without Worry\" and Its Preface**\n\nWhat is called \"no-learning\" is not non-learning. If one takes non-learning as no-learning, one remains ignorant and indistinguishable from the common crowd. This so-called no-learning is the culmination of extensive learning. Most people learn to be extraordinary, but the more they learn, the less they understand. The sage said: *\"The farther one goes, the less one knows.\"* And also: *\"Much leads to confusion; little leads to attainment.\"* This is precisely the point. A former Confucian said: *\"With effort, one rests all day; without effort, one does not rest.\"* This is the same idea. Thus, I write this piece to demonstrate it, so that learners are not burdened by the hearer and solitary realizer vehicles, or by intellectual understanding and discriminative knowledge.\n\nIn daily life, all is profoundly mysterious,\nYet people do not fully recognize it.\nOne should pursue what the heart truly loves,\nAnd let go of mere verbal Zen.\n\nEvery dharma is not an empty dharma;\nEvery transmission is a false transmission.\nWithout cultivating blessings first,\nHow can misfortune arise prematurely?\n\nWithout gain, there is no loss;\nWithout change, how can there be alteration?\nWithout defilement, there is no purity;\nWithout lack, there is no completeness.\n\nDo not cling to anger or joy;\nWhy worry about adversity or obstruction?\nWithout doing good as cause,\nHow can evil conditions arise?\n\nUnconcerned with rise and fall,\nName and profit do not entangle.\nCoarse and fine incur no worry or aversion;\nBeauty and ugliness evoke no hatred or love.",
