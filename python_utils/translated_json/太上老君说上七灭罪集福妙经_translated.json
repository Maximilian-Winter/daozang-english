  "full_translation": "The Supreme Venerable Lord’s Sublime Scripture on the Seven Superior [Days] for Eliminating Sins and Accumulating Blessings\n\nAt that time, during the final kalpa of the Dragon Han era, the Supreme Venerable Lord was upon the summit of Mount Sumeru, where he assembled with celestial immortals, terrestrial immortals, flying immortals, divine immortals, and the multitude from the ten directions. There, he expounded the Daoist teachings. With his benevolent gaze, he beheld the boundless sentient beings of the Southern Jambudvīpa, each household plagued by pestilential qi, official disputes, loss of wealth and position, and the calamities of death among kin. He then summoned the Seven Perfected Ones of the Northern Dipper to inquire, for all the myriad families under heaven were afflicted by these misfortunes.\n\nThereupon, the Seven Perfected Ones of the Northern Dipper straightened their robes and caps, held their tablets upright, and advanced to bow thrice in reverence. They addressed the Venerable Lord, saying: \"We humbly submit that the people do not believe in the Three Treasures, forsake the true and embrace the perverse, commit the ten evils and five rebellions, and fail to turn their hearts toward goodness. On the superior seven days of each month, they neither burn petitions nor perform repentance to purify body and mind, nor do they safeguard their kin. Thus, the messengers of the Dipper’s Mouth record their good and evil deeds on these days and report them to the celestial courts, where their allotted lifespan and fortune are diminished, bringing about these disasters.\"\n\nThe Venerable Lord replied: \"Excellent, excellent! The Seven Perfected Ones of the Northern Dipper have made a beneficial proposal. Yet the people remain unaware and heedless, how then can they fear calamity? Let the Seven Perfected Ones of the Northern Dipper first be known as the Ten Great Heavenly Worthies for Eliminating Sins, Dispelling Disasters, Augmenting Blessings, and Aiding Virtue. If good men and good women hear this sublime scripture on the superior seven days, make offerings, burn incense, and recite it before the sacred, they shall dissolve the karmic obstructions and hindrances of sins committed in body, speech, and mind, and through the sacred names, all transgressions shall be eradicated.\"\n\nThen the Venerable Lord proclaimed the names, saying:\nHeavenly Worthy of Greedy Wolf, may my household attain peace and tranquility...\n\nHeavenly Worthy of Great Gate, may my parents attain long life and preservation,\nHeavenly Worthy of Emolument-Preserving, may my honor and career fulfill my aspirations,\nHeavenly Worthy of Literary Splendor, may my entire household enjoy health and well-being,\nHeavenly Worthy of Integrity and Chastity, may my descendants flourish in glory,\nHeavenly Worthy of Martial Valor, may all my evils be forever dispelled,\nHeavenly Worthy of Army-Breaking, may my livestock thrive and multiply,\nHeavenly Worthy of Assisting Ministers, may my illnesses be cured and healed,\nHeavenly Worthy of Three Terraces, may my wealth and possessions not be squandered,\nHeavenly Worthy of Floral Canopy, may misfortune never arise.\n\nThe Dao declares: The common folk, in their ignorance, do not know that the Seven Perfected Saints descend to the human realm each month. They may dissolve disasters, repent sins, pray for blessings, and prolong life. According to one’s capacity, let them perform rites and offerings, and their virtue and power shall increase in majesty.\n\nThose good men and good women who, during the superior seven days, do not believe in incense and offerings, thereby slighting life and deluding their origin, are unworthy of the human form. The heavenly authorities shall strip them of their emoluments and shorten their lifespan. After such persons pass away, they shall drift through the six destinies, reborn among birds and beasts, forever losing the human form.\n\nOn the superior seven days, good men and good women who cultivate offerings of incense and present petitions shall have their goodness reach the heavenly courts. For generation after generation, they shall be wealthy, intelligent, and preeminent among humankind.\n\nIf there are men and women whose karmic endowment is meager and who live in poverty, even if they know of the superior seven days but lack the means to perform offerings, they may pour water and present flowers, bowing in reverence toward the Northern Dipper, reciting the names of the Ten Great Heavenly Worthies of the Northern Dipper and their own life-commanding Perfected Lords. All shall thereby attain prolonged life and recorded blessings, their disasters and calamities dissolved, and their blessings boundless. Their fortune and longevity shall increase, their households preserved in peace.\n\nBy the merit of this scripture-recitation, we first adorn the myriad heavens and the Ten Directions’ Great Saints, the sovereigns, emperors, masters, and parents. Next, for the disciples reciting this scripture and their entire households, we pray for peace. Finally, for all sentient beings in the Dharma realm, may they depart from the source of suffering and together ascend to the Dao’s fruition.\n\nThus we chant:\nThereupon the Seven Origin Lords,\nGreat Saints of wondrous efficacy,\nDeliver from all calamities,\nRescue suffering beings from distress.\nWhoever invokes and recites shall be preserved in peace,\nAll blessings shall arise from revering this scripture.\n\nThe Dao declares: As the scripture’s recitation nears its end, dragons, cranes, and heavenly immortals come to welcome the Venerable Lord back to Jade Capital.\n\nThen the Venerable Lord again addressed the Seven Perfected Ones of the Northern Dipper, saying: You may propagate the Orthodox Teaching, deliver sentient beings, and bestow boundless blessings, sharing in the highest goodness. If good men and good women throughout their lives revere and recite this scripture, believing and receiving it for thirty years, their names shall be recorded in the heavenly courts, and their names erased from the earthly prisons. When their emoluments are exhausted and their lives end, they shall not dwell in the dark realms but ascend directly to heaven, their names forever expunged from the Ten Kings’ ledgers.\n\nThereupon the Seven Star Perfected Ones, having attained the Dao, bowed to the Venerable Lord, circulated the scripture in the world, and widely transmitted its teachings. Let none speak of it as unworthy; hold it in utmost sincerity.\n\nThus concludes *The Venerable Lord Lao’s Sublime Scripture of the Superior Seven for Eliminating Sins and Accumulating Blessings*.",
