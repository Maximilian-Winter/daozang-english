Seal with a **clay pot** (瓦瓮子), using **6:1 ratio clay** (六一泥) to secure the lid.\n\n**Madame Cai’s Method:**\nThe pot’s base and belly should be lined with damp clay or **salt flower** (布). Use **civilized and martial fires** (文武火) to heat it, lasting three days and three nights as the measure.\nWhen opened, sweep the transformed substance with **crow’s feathers** (乌羽)—it will be **liquid mercury** (水银).

For every two *jīn* (斤) of mercury, add four *liǎng* (两) of **sulfur** (硫黄), grinding until thoroughly combined.\nPlace in a crucible, seal with **6:1 ratio clay** (六一泥), and heat with **civilized and martial fires** (文武火) for three days and three nights. When the crucible’s base turns **crimson** (赤色) like the flame, stop.\n\nUpon opening, the mercury will have reverted to **cinnabar** (朱砂).\nThen take the **cinnabar** (朱砂), seal and heat it again as before, until it turns **crimson** (赤) and transforms into an elixir (丹).\nThus, the **Cinnabar Scripture** (丹砂经) says:\n*\"Cinnabar is the essence of wood* (丹砂木精), *and when it meets mercury* (得金), *their union is complete.\nThe **mercurial qi** (金气) then gradually forms the elixir.\"*\n\n---\n\n**Third Transformation:**\nTake the **cinnabar-merged elixir** (前丹砂) from the second transformation, grinding it into powder as in the first.\nAgain, take **Gua State alum** (瓜矾) per *jīn* (斤), mixing thoroughly with the powder.\nSeal in a **clay pot** (瓮子) as before, heating with **civilized and martial fires** (文武火) for three days and three nights.\nOpen and sweep with **crow’s feathers** (乌羽)—it will again revert to **liquid mercury** (水银).\nIf not fully transformed, repeat until complete.\n\n**Scripture Says:**\n*\"The Great Sun’s flowing pearl* (太阳流珠),\nEver seeks to leave mankind.\nYet when it meets **mercurial blossoms** (金花),\nIt turns and binds in harmony.\nWait until the white liquid congeals and hardens—\nThis means it has again absorbed the **mercurial qi** (金花之气),\nThus attaining the firmness of its nature.\"*\n\n---\n\n**Fourth Transformation:**\nFirst, take a **gold-silver cauldron** (金银铛), capable of holding two or three *dǒu* (斗).\nUse **premium Gua State alum stone** (上好瓜矾石) forty *liǎng* (两). Place the **mercury** (汞) into the vessel and simmer for thirty days until reduced to five *shēng* (升).\nTake **five shēng of brine** (盐汁五升), mixing with the **alum water** (矾水) in the vessel and boil.\nAdd **one liǎng each of great phoenix sand** (大鹏砂), **malachite** (曾青), and **blue vitriol** (空青), simmering until the liquid reaches a **fish-eye boil** (鱼眼沸). Let it rest for one *fú* (伏) time.\n\nSeparately, take an **iron crucible** (铁鼎) capable of holding three *shēng* (升) or more. Pour in the **alum water** (矾水), then gradually add **liquid mercury** (水银), heating for seven days and seven nights.\nExtract the **mercury** (汞) through a **silk bag** (绢中), collecting the thickened portion. Repeat the process with the remaining mercury until all is condensed.\n\n**Scripture Says:**\n*\"Planting grain with millet* (植禾以粟),\nCovering hens with their eggs* (覆鸡用子).\nThese transformations follow their own laws,\nYet they must rely on **mercurial qi** (金气) to intermingle.\"*\n\n**Why so?**\n\nBefore the elixir’s components unite,\nBefore the trigrams and agents intermingle,\nYin and Yang must first separate to then coalesce.\n\n**Sixth Transformation:**\nTake the slightly hardened mercury from the Fifth Transformation.\nIn an iron pan, mix **realgar (雄黄)** two *liǎng*,\n**calcined sand (炮砂)** five *liǎng*,\nand **great phoenix sand (大鹏砂)** one *liǎng*,\nground into a powder in a medicinal vessel.\nAdd the **alum water (矾石水)** from the Fourth Transformation gradually,\nsimmering until a **fish-eye boil (鱼眼沸)**—\nfor **three times seven days and nights (三七日夜)**.\nWhen it turns a pale yellow and can be struck upon the anvil,\nstop immediately.\nIf not yet refined further,\nadjust the fire accordingly—\nuntil the yellow is malleable enough to strike.\n\n**Scripture Says:**\n*\"When the **dragon and tiger** are harmonized and united,\nThey are led into the **Red Gate (赤色门)**,\nSealed at their juncture,\nMade firm and unyielding.\nThen, when mixed with the medicine and burned,\nThe firmness finds its proper place.\"*\n\n**Seventh Transformation:**\nTake the pale-yellow, hardened mercury from the Sixth Transformation,\nmelt it in the crucible to form a flat cake.\nTake **calcined sand (炮砂)** ten *liǎng*,\n**swallowed salt (盥)** one *shēng*,\nand mix with three *dòu* of water.\nSoak for one *fú* time, then add the mercury and simmer for **two times seven days (二七日)**.\nRemove and strike upon the anvil.\nIf brittle, first burn the cake until red,\nthen wipe with **ram’s horn (羊角)** back and forth.\nIf too pliable, burn and wipe as before,\nstriking repeatedly until it reaches the proper malleability.\nFinally, strike it into thin leaves like paper.\n\nAgain, take **calcined sand (炮砂)** ten *liǎng*,\n**red earth (赤土)** five *shēng*,\nand **Hu-tong resin (胡桐律)** one *liǎng*,\nmixed and sifted through a **fine sieve (梼筛)**.\nLayer upon the previously refined **golden leaves (金叶子)**,\nthen wrap according to the **gold-wrapping method (包金法)**,\nburning in **cow-dung fire (牛粪火)** for over ten days,\nuntil the color fades to absolute red.\nThis is the **subdued gold (伏金)**.\n\n**Scripture Says:**\n*\"Gold is the essence of Yang.*\nOnly then can it be called **Returned Cinnabar (还丹)**—\nWhen the **yellow gold** is refined back to its original vermilion hue,\nIt may be called Yang,\nAnd thus becomes the **Golden Elixir (金丹)**.\"*\n\n**Eighth Transformation:**\nTake the **subdued gold leaves (伏火金叶子)** from the Seventh Transformation,\nburn until red.\nFor every two *liǎng* of gold, add one *liǎng* of mercury,\ngrinding while hot until it becomes a dense **golden paste (金泥膏)**.\nShape into pieces the size of a fingernail,\nand arrange them in the **elixir furnace (丹炉)**.\n\nTake **swallowed salt (盥)**, **niter (硝石)**, and **Hu-tong resin (胡桐律)**—\neach one *dà liǎng*,\nground finely and layered in succession,\nuntil the furnace is completely filled.\nSeal tightly and burn with **civilized and martial fires (文武火)** for three *fú* times.\nWhen cooled, open it.\nIf the mercury has fully volatilized,\ngrind the remaining gold with **swallowed salt** and purify with water,\nrepeating until all mercury is exhausted.\nThe result is a **purple, granular powder (赫然紫色，如细砂)**.\n\n**Scripture Says:**\n*\"When the **golden sand** enters the five viscera,\nIts mist disperses like wind and rain.\nIt permeates the four limbs,\nBrightening the complexion, reddening the face,\nGlowing the hair and beard,\nExtending life.\nTaken long-term, its divine efficacy is immeasurable—\nAvoiding worldly calamities,\nOne is called a **True Person (真人)**.\nFor cinnabar is the gold,\nThus it is called **Returned Golden Sand (还金砂)**.\"*\n\n**Ninth Transformation:**\nTake the **purified gold sand (飞了金砂)** from the Eighth Transformation,\nand mix with **salt (盐)**.\nFor every *jīn* of gold sand, add eight *liǎng* of **realgar (雄黄)**,\nseal tightly, and refine with **civilized and martial fires (文武火)** until complete.\nThen, with clean water, wash away the **realgar** and **swallowed salt**,\nallowing the gold sand to settle.\n**Cai Wenjun** says:\n*\"Realgar floats lightly upon the water,\nWhile the gold sand, heavy, sinks below.\"*\n\nRoll into pills the size of **millet grains (黍米大)** with honey.\nFrom the Eighth Transformation’s **purple gold (紫金色)**,\nto the Ninth, it turns **vermilion (赤)**—\nThus it is called **Returned Cinnabar (还丹)**.\n\nThis elixir **drives away ten thousand ailments**,\nand prolonged use **extends life and restores youth**.\n\n**Method to Neutralize Gold Toxicity:**\nFor every *fū* of mercury to be turned into gold,\nor lead/tin likewise,\nuse **mysterious bright powder (玄明粉)** five *liǎng*,\nsoaked in three *shēng* of water.\nThe **Ninth Transformation gold sand (金砂)** is placed in a vessel,\nwith **gardenia vinegar (栀子醋)** for three *fú* times.\n**Mysterious bright powder** neutralizes all combined toxic elixirs,\nwhile **gardenia** captures the volatile essence to stillness.\n\n**Method to Neutralize Fire Toxicity:**\nTake one *shēng* of **honey (蜜)**,\nmixed with half a *shēng* of clean water,\nand simmer for three *fú* times.\nThen purify with clear water and settle.\n\nAgain, place the **gold sand** in a **five-to-six-layered silk bag (五六重帛，练袋)**,\nthen wrap it in **layered silk (帛练)**,\nsubmerging it at the bottom of a well—\nno fear of any harm.\n\n**\"Completion of the Secret for the Ninefold
