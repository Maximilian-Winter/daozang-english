  "full_translation": "**Longsheng (Nirvana of Vitality) Canon**\n*Title:* **Longsheng Canon** (長生詮經).\n*Attributed to:* Unknown author. Compiled from fragments of various Daoist schools on longevity cultivation. One scroll.\n*Source:* *Continuation of the Daoist Canon* (續道藏), Huizi imprint (槐字號).\n\n**Longsheng Canon (長生詮經) – Pure Clarity Canon (清淨經)**\nA person’s spirit (神) naturally seeks purity, yet the mind (心) is disturbed by it;\nA person’s mind naturally seeks stillness, yet the passions (欲) drag it away.\nIf one habitually abandons the passions, the mind will naturally be still;\nIf one clears the mind, the spirit will naturally be pure.\nInwardly observing the mind, the mind itself is gone;\nOutwardly observing the form, the form itself is gone;\nDistantly observing all things, all things themselves are gone.\nWhen these three insights are realized, only emptiness (空) is seen.\nObserving emptiness is also emptiness—emptiness has nothing to empty.\nWhat emptiness empties, if it does not exist, then the nonexistence of nonexistence is also nonexistent.\nWhen the nonexistence of nonexistence is nonexistent, the spirit (神) is perpetually tranquil and serene.\n\n**Yinfu Canon (陰符經)**\nThe mind (心) arises from things (物) and dies from things (物); the key lies in the eyes (目).\nThe living are the root of death, and the dead are the root of life.\nKindness (恩) arises from harm (害), and harm arises from kindness.\nOne who understands this principle will not be harmed by either.\n\n**Donggu Canon (洞古經)**\nMovement arises from stillness, and action arises from non-action (無為).\nNon-action (無為) returns the spirit (神), and when the spirit returns, all things are in tranquil repose (雲寂).\nStillness (不動) extinguishes *qi* (氣), and when *qi* is extinguished, all things have no birth.\nForgetting the eyes (目) lets light overflow boundlessly;\nExtinguishing the ears (耳) lets the mind’s perception remain ever profound.\nWhen both keys are forgotten, the gates of all mysteries open.\n\nCultivate the formless (無象), and the form (象) will naturally endure;\nPreserve the bodiless (無體), and the body (體) will remain fully true.\nWhen the fully true is harmonized, longevity is achieved.\nHeaven endures because it attains its truth (真), Earth lasts because it attains its truth, and humans live long because they attain their truth.\n\n**Datong Canon (大通經)**\nStillness is its nature (性), and the mind (心) resides within it;\nMovement is its mind (心), and the nature (性) resides within it.\nWhen the mind arises, the nature is extinguished;\nWhen the mind is extinguished, the nature manifests,\nLike emptiness without form, perpetually complete and round.\n\nThe Great Dao (大道) is formless, so inwardly it is not confined by existence (有);\nTrue nature (真性) is without action (無為), so outwardly it does not generate the mind.\nThus, it flows naturally, boundless and without limit.\nFacing external phenomena while forgetting them—both do not sink into the six demons’ (六賊) illusions;\nAbiding in dust yet transcending it—one does not fall into the transformations of myriad things (萬緑之化).\nThis is the true state of equilibrium.\n\n**Dingguan Canon (定觀經)**\nOnly extinguish the restless mind (動心), do not extinguish the observing mind (照心);\nOnly concentrate the empty mind (空心), do not fixate on the abiding mind (住心).\nWith or without affairs (事), always as if without mind;\nIn quiet or in tumult, the intention remains singular.\nRestrain yet do not cling, release yet remain unmoved;\nAbide in tumult without malice, engage in affairs without vexation—this is true equilibrium (定).\nDo not seek affairs to avoid vexation, nor force tumult to avoid malice.\nTake the state of no-affairs as the true dwelling, and action (有為) as the responsive boundary.\nLike water reflecting objects, it shows form with each thing.\n\n**Taixi Canon (胎息經)**\nThe embryo (胎) forms from concealed *qi* (伏氣), and *qi* dissipates when the embryo is present.\nWhen *qi* enters the body, life is sustained; when the spirit departs, death ensues.\nKnowing that the spirit and *qi* can bring about longevity, one steadfastly preserves the void (虛無) to nurture the spirit and *qi*.\nWhen the spirit moves, *qi* moves; when the spirit abides, *qi* abides.\nIf one seeks longevity, the spirit and *qi* must be harmonized.\n\n**Taixi Inscription (胎息銘)**\nThirty-six throat openings, one must prioritize the first.\nExhaling must be subtle and refined, inhaling must be soft and continuous.\nSitting or moving, the posture must be natural and unconstrained.\nAvoid clamor, abstain from pungent or greasy foods (腥膻).\nThis is called *Taixi* (胎息, Embryonic Breath), but in truth it is *Neidan* (內丹, Internal Alchemy).\nNot only does it treat illness, but it also stabilizes the body’s equilibrium, and over time, one ascends among the immortals (上仙).\n\n**Taishang Riyong Canon (太上日用經)**\nDaily sustenance and meals: refrain from speaking, sit upright in silence,\nDo not stir a single thought, abandon all concerns, preserve the spirit and stabilize the intention.\nDo not let the eyes perceive objects, nor the ears hear sounds.\nFocus the mind inwardly, regulate the breath softly and continuously,\nGradually exhale, never forcing interruption.\nSeemingly present yet seemingly absent, the natural descent of heart-fire (心火) and ascent of kidney-water (腎水) will occur,\nSaliva will gather in the mouth, the refined essence (靈真) will attach to the body,\nAnd one will attain true longevity.\n\nWithin the twelve temporal divisions (十二時), one must always maintain purity.\nThe spirit is the child of *qi*, and *qi* is the mother of the spirit.\nLike a phoenix (鵬) guarding its egg, how can one preserve the spirit and nurture *qi* without separation?\n\n**Xinyin Canon (心印經)**\nThe three superior medicines (上藥) are spirit (神), *qi* (氣), and essence (精).\nVague yet indistinct, distant yet profound,\nPreserve the void (無) and do not cling to the form (有)—instantly achieved.\nWhen the breath (風) returns and blends, a hundred days’ practice yields results.\nSilently communing with the Supreme (上帝), after a year (一紀), one ascends in flight.\n\n**Shuihuo Canon (水火真經)**\nDesire arises from the mind (欲從心起), and breath is regulated by the mind’s stillness (息從心定).\nMind and breath are interdependent; when breath is harmonized, the mind becomes still.\n\n**Wenshi Canon (文始經)**\nWhen the mind is moved by things, no life is generated;\nWhen the mind generates, essence and function intermingle.\nThe mind does not generate life from things—only perception (識) arises;\nThings are not yet true, let alone perception—how much less emotions (情).\nThose who gaze at intricate carvings (雕琢) will lose their clarity (明);\nThose who listen to refined sounds (文響) will lose their acuity (聪);\nThose who ponder profound mysteries (玄妙) will injure their minds.\n\nTo sustain *qi* with the spirit, to sustain the form with *qi*—this is how one prolongs life;\nTo merge the form with the spirit, to merge *qi* with *qi*—this is how one conceals life.\nAbsorbing *qi* to nourish its harmony, who could ever feel hunger?\nPreserving the spirit to foster its warmth, who could ever feel cold?\n\n**Dongling Canon (洞靈經)**\nGuiding the sinews and bones (筋骨) keeps the form intact;\nPruning emotions and desires (情欲) preserves the spirit whole;\nCalming speech (言語) ensures fortune is complete.\nMaintaining these two wholenesses is the way of the sage and the worthy.\n\n**Yushu Canon (玉枢經)**\nThe Daoist enters through sincerity (以誠而入), guards through silence (以默而守), and acts through softness (以柔而用).\nUsing sincerity appears as foolishness, using silence appears as dullness, using softness appears as clumsiness.\nThose who enter the Dao know restraint (知止), those who guard the Dao know caution (知謹), those who apply the Dao know subtlety (知微).\nTo know subtlety is to generate wisdom-light (慧光), to know caution is to attain complete sage-knowledge (聖知), to know the highest is to achieve supreme tranquility (泰安定).\n\n**Chongxu Canon (沖虛經)**\nPursuing external wanderings (外遊) is not as good as inward observation (內觀).\nExternal wanderers seek completeness in things, while inward observers find sufficiency within the body.\nThe ultimate wanderer knows not where to go, the ultimate observer knows not what to see.\nSpirit meeting external forms is dream (神遇為夢), the body interfacing with affairs is reality (形接為事).\nDaytime thoughts and nighttime dreams are where spirit and form interact;\nThus, when the spirit is concentrated, thoughts and dreams naturally vanish.\n\n**Zhuangzi (南華經)**\nThe southern grove’s trees—self-slain;\nThe tallow’s flame—self-scourged.\nThe cassia is eaten, so it is felled;\nThe jade is used, so it is carved.\nAll know the use of what is useful,\nYet none know the use of what is useless.\n\nThe Dao’s essence is profound and dark;\nIts utmost reaches are dim and silent.\nDo not weary your form,\nNor agitate your spirit—\nThen longevity may be attained.\nLet the eyes see nothing,\nThe ears hear nothing,\nThe heart know nothing—\nThen your spirit will guard your form,\nAnd your form will achieve longevity.\n\n**Sanmao Zhenjing (三茅真經)**\nThe valley’s emptiness responds to sound;\nThe heart’s emptiness responds to spirit;\nThe spirit’s emptiness responds to *qi*;\nThe *qi*’s emptiness responds to essence.\nWhen emptiness is extreme, clarity arises;\nWhen clarity is extreme, luminosity emerges.\nTranscending spirit and form,\nThere is no death nor life.\n\nEssence is guarded from within,\n*Qi* is generated from without—\nTo take *qi* to preserve essence\nIs the way to longevity.\n\n**Weishengjing (衛生經)**\nEssence, *qi*, and spirit are the three inner treasures;\nEars, eyes, and mouth are the three outer treasures.\nLet the inner treasures not chase after things and scatter,\nNor the outer treasures entice the mind and disturb.\n\n**Dongshen Zhenjing (洞神真經)**\nNeither honored nor humiliated—\nThe liver wood then calms;\nMoving and resting with reverence—\nThe heart fire then settles.\nDiet is moderate—\nThe spleen earth does not leak;\nBreathing regulated, speech sparse—\nThe lung metal remains whole.\nSerene and without desire—\nThe kidney water suffices.\n\n**Yuandao Zhenjing (元道真經)**\nGrasses and trees grow from roots;\nRemoved from earth, they die.\nFish and turtles thrive submerged;\nRemoved from water, they die.\nHumans live by form;\nRemoved from *qi*, they die.\nThus, the sage knows where *qi* resides\nAnd treasures it as the body’s jewel.\n\n**Han Tian Shi Yu (漢天師語)**\nThe Great Dao is void and boundless,\nPure and serene.\nUnstained is purity,\nUnmoved is stillness.\nNot seeing is serenity,\nNot hearing is tranquility.\nDiligently cultivate these four—\nThen you may avoid decline.\n\n**Pure Yang Zhenren (純陽真人)**\nA day of calm, a day of weariness;\nThe Six Spirits harmonized, naturally at ease.\nThe *dantian* holds treasure—no need to seek the Dao;\nBefore phenomena, no mind—no need to ask of Zen.\nNurture *qi* and forget speech,\nLower the heart to do nothing.\nIn motion and stillness, know the ancestral root—\nWith no affairs, whom else to seek?\n\nThe True Constant must respond to things,\nYet responding must not be deluded.\nUndeluded, nature abides;\nNature abides, *qi* returns.\n*Qi* returns, the elixir forms—\nThe vessel unites *kan* and *li*.\nYin and yang generate and return,\nUniversal transformation—one thunderous sound.\nWhite clouds crown the summit,\nSweet dew rains upon Mount Sumeru.\nDrink the elixir of longevity yourself,\nAdrift in ease—who else knows?\nSitting, listening to the soundless melody,\nIlluminated, comprehending the workings of transformation.\nTwenty lines gathered—\nTruly the ladder to heaven.\n\n**Xu Jing Tian Shi (虚静天師)**\nFear not the thoughts arising,\nOnly dread awareness lagging.\nThoughts arising are illness,\nNot continuing is the cure.\nSteady mindfulness governs impermanence—\nThe heart desires death, the machine desires life.\nThe Great Dao is not distant—it dwells within the body;\nAll things are empty, yet nature is not empty.\nIf nature is not empty, *qi* abides with it;\n*Qi* returns to the primal sea—longevity without end.\nTo keep the body’s spirit from leaving,\nDo not linger on the spirit platform with anything.\nThings in the heart scatter the spirit,\nDissipating true essence and harming sinews and bones.\nWhen the true spirit departs, retrieve it immediately—\nThe spirit returns to the body, *qi* flows back.\nThus, morning and evening,\nNaturally the赤子 bears the true embryo.\n\n**Li Zhenren (李真人)**\nInhale and lift—*qi* returns to the navel.\nLift and swallow—water and fire meet.\n\n**Sanmao Zhenjun (三茅真君)**\nThe spirit platform is clear as an ice vessel,\nOnly the true spirit may dwell within.\nIf you leave anything here,\nHow could you verify the Dao and merge with emptiness?\n\n**Han Shan Zi (寒山子)**\nIn winter, do not go hungry at dawn;\nIn summer, do not overeat at night.\nRise before the cock’s crow,\nRetire before the sun ascends.\nWhen the heart is clear, the true person guards its place;\nWhen *qi* is steady, impurities leave the body.\n\n**Yu Xu Zi (玉虚子)**\nAll things originally have no form,\nThe heart is neither form nor non-form.\nTwofold observation brings awakening—\nThe awakened do not know who they are.\nThe void of voids hides subtle existence;\nExistence of existence reveals true emptiness.\nBoth stillness and luminosity stand not,\nEver-serene nature merges.\n\n**Zhong Huang Zhenren (中黃真人)**\nThe celestial gate must always be open,\nThe earthly gate must be closed.\nBreathing softly and continuously,\nDo not let it falter for an instant.\nInhale to the roots,\nExhale to the calyx.\nThe male is called spirit,\nThe female is called *qi*.\nLike a bird brooding an egg,\nLike a fish in water.\nThe sacred embryo forms—\nNaturally, the cicada sheds its shell.\n\n**Ma Dan Yang (馬丹陽)**\nThe Dao’s nature, though unmodified and unverified,\nRequires the dust-heart to daily diminish and consume;\nUntil the heart is forgotten and nature is forgotten,\nOnly then does one align with unmodified and unverified.\nRefining *qi* as livelihood,\nCheering the spirit as daily practice.\nAlways harmonize the dragon and tiger,\nNever let the horse and monkey prevail.\nWhen nature is steady, emotions are forgotten;\nWhen the form is empty, *qi* flows;\nWhen the heart dies, the spirit is alive;\nWhen yang flourishes, yin wanes.\nCultivate the heart to be a guest of longevity,\nRefine nature to revive the dead.\n\n**Xuan Guan Milu (玄關秘論)**\nWhen the heart is entangled in affairs,\nFire stirs within.\nOnce the heart-fire moves,\nTrue essence must tremble—\nThus, kill the heart to nurture *qi*,\nExtinguish the mechanism to still necessity.\nDo nothing with the heart,\nThen the heart has no affairs—\nThus, stillness generates wisdom,\nAgitation brings confusion.\n\n**Hao Tai Gu (郝太古)**\nThe realm slays the heart—it becomes ordinary;\nThe heart slays the realm—it becomes a transcendent.\nIn stillness, refine *qi*;\nIn tumult, refine the spirit.\n\n**Wang Qi Yun (王栖雲)**\nThe heart follows phenomena, phenomena follow the heart.\nIf you wish the heart to be steady,\nDo not love what the world loves,\nDo not do what the world does.\nAmid red dust and green allure, unmoved—\nNaturally, the heart is clear and the mind serene,\nYin and yang cannot forge you.\nTo expel desire and clarify the heart is still the heart;\nTo subdue the heart to desire, desire must be profound—\nBetter than not arousing the deluded thoughts,\nRevealing the hundred-forged gold from nothingness.\n\n**Bai Yu Chan (白玉蟾)**\nThe Great Dao takes non-action as its essence,\nForgetting speech as its function,\nSoftness and weakness as its root,\nPurity and struggle as its foundation.\nReduce flavors to nourish *qi*,\nAbandon wrath and anger to nurture nature,\nDwell in lowliness to cultivate virtue,\nGuard purity to nurture the Dao.\n\nThe true fire has no need for signs,\nThe great medicine requires no measure.\nFor the spirit is fire, *qi* is the medicine—\nRefining the medicine with fire to forge the elixir\nIs the same as the spirit governing *qi* to attain the Dao.\n\nTo make the spirit govern *qi*,\nTo make *qi* return to the spirit—\nNo more than the method of reclaiming radiance and reversing light,\nGathering the scattered threads of thought.\n\nAs for the Golden Elixir,\nIt is made by gathering the two-eights’ medicines,\nAnd gestating for three hundred days.\nThe essential practice lies not in swallowing saliva or inhaling *qi*,\nBut in the primordial transformation—\nOne must gather *qi* and condense the spirit.\n\nAll depends on practice,\nRelying on incantations,\nSimple yet profound,\nNeither complex nor difficult.\n\nFrom nothingness, nurture the infant,\nWithin the yin, forge yang *qi*.\nLet the Golden Sage capture the living tiger,\nCommand the Azure Maiden to ride the Vermilion Dragon.\nMatch the Heavenly Male with the Earthly Female through the matchmaker’s art,\nBind the Fire Maiden with the Water Male to produce the Red Child.\n\nA furnace’s flame refines the void—\nTurning into fine dust;\nA vast ice-vessel illuminates the world—\nAs small as millet grains.\n\nWhen the spirit returns to the Four Great Elements,\nIt is the moment of the Tortoise and Serpent’s union;\nWhen *qi* enters the Four Limbs,\nIt is the dwelling of the Rabbit and Hare.\n\nThe Jade Gourd bursts forth with golden fluid,\nThe Golden Sprout blooms into white jade flowers.\nAt the time when wind chimes and moonlight are clear,\nWho cares for the green hills and flowing waters?\n\nJoyous, joyous—truly joyous!\nThe void shattered, autumn hairs returned to dust—\nCountless lifetimes of death and rebirth,\nThis great death now returns to the old nest of life.\nFrom nothingness, all is stripped away—\nThe father was always the grandfather.\nDazed and confused, like a melon near the west,\nYet now it seems to recognize the bundle.\nSeventy-seven times as before, forty like a dragon nurturing a pearl—\nNever forgotten.\nLike a goose brooding an egg, *qi* unchanging,\nOr like a cicada drinking the morning breeze,\nOr like an old clam holding autumn’s chill—\nA free man asks the heavens and earth,\nLaughs once, and the heavens and earth expand.\n\nI have a bright pearl, radiant and dazzling,\nPiercing the three thousand great *chiliocosms* at dusk.\nKuan-yin’s mind is steady,\nShakyamuni’s Great Round is tight—\nOr like spring’s charm over mountains and rivers,\nOr autumn’s crispness on cliffs and divinations.\nIt is also called the Nine-Turn Great Return Elixir,\nOr the Elixir of Immortality, envied by walls and tiles.\nMuddled with water and trees, mingling with the moon’s crescent,\nThe Stone Maiden rides the Earth Ox,\nThe Lame Wooden Man astride paper—\nThe Three Poisons, the Six Roots, the Six Dusts drift like clouds.\nThis pearl’s worth is vast, yet hard to repay,\nNo clever needle may pierce it in vain.\nIf you seek the Secret Great *Dhāraṇī*,\nIn stillness, close your eyes—\nHow many children are born in silence?\nListen to the thunder beneath the pillow—\nThis Daoist hides his palm in boundless space,\nSeeking beyond the pearl.\nUnknowing of the primordial *that*, *that*—\nWhy bother with further annotations?\n\nThe cuckoo’s cry follows the morning rain,\nThe peach blossom listens to the east wind fall.\n\nThe Rabbit-Hare’s cauldron of Heaven and Earth,\nThe Tortoise-Serpent’s filthy furnace.\nThe world asks of the carefree traveler,\nWithin the heart, the Great Return Elixir.\n\nThe White Tiger roars in water,\nThe Green Dragon coils in fire.\nMercury and lead bloom like muddy flowers,\nMetal and wood freeze in snowflakes.\n\nFire and Water are not virtuous in the heart,\nBinding the west does not harm the lungs and liver.\nThirty days of exhaustion, seven returns,\nNine turns yield the mud pellet.\n\n**Master Sima**\nTo cultivate the True,\nFirst eliminate wicked deeds,\nSever all external affairs,\nLest they disturb the mind.\n\nThen, inwardly observe the Awakened King—\nWhen a thought arises, extinguish it immediately.\nArise and vanish together,\nStrive for absolute stillness.\n\nThough no greedy attachment remains,\nEven fleeting, chaotic thoughts must be eradicated.\nDay and night, diligently practice,\nWithout pause or respite.\n\nOnly extinguish the restless mind,\nDo not extinguish the luminous mind.\nBe empty yet not attached to emptiness,\nDo not cling to any method—\nYet the mind remains in its true nature.\nThis method is profound and wondrous,\nIts benefits immeasurable.\n\nPreserve the original *qi* unharmed,\nFew thoughts let the wisdom-light shine within.\nNo anger lets the hundred spirits harmonize,\nNo vexation keeps the heart’s ground cool.\nSeek nothing, yet flatter not, nor be proud.\nHold neither to round nor square,\nNor covet wealth—\nFear no king or lord.\n\nWhen tastes are abandoned, the spirit-spring descends on its own,\nWhen *qi* is settled, the true breath lengthens naturally.\nIf touched, the form dies while the spirit roams,\nIf imagined, the dream departs while the corpse stiffens.\nIf *qi* leaks, the form returns to the earth,\nIf thought leaks, the spirit drifts to the land of death.\nOnly when the heart-garden revives the spirit,\nDoes the soul’s storehouse strengthen the vital essence.\n\nTo transform phenomena exhausts subtle principles,\nTo respond to changes does not depart from the eternal.\nThe utmost refinement hides in bewilderment,\nThe great form is obscured in boundless vastness.\nCreation knows no rules or measures,\nGhosts and gods cannot fathom their retreat or emergence.\nNot drinking, not eating, yet deeply rooted—\nThis is the True Person’s *wu-wei* forgetfulness.\n\n**Master Sun**\nBetween heaven and earth, humanity is most precious—\nThe head mirrors heaven, the body mirrors earth.\nThe parents’ given form must be treasured,\nFor longevity is the highest of the Nine Categories.\n\nThe essentials of health must heed three prohibitions:\nGreat anger, great desire, and great intoxication.\nIf even one of these persists,\nBeware of losing your true *qi*.\n\nTo seek longevity, restrain your nature—\nFire does not emerge, and the heart is self-sufficient.\nWood returning to fire does not turn to ash,\nIf one restrains their nature, life extends.\n\nUnending greed forgets the essence,\nExcessive thought exhausts the spirit.\nLaboring the body scatters the harmonious *qi*—\nOn what then shall you rely to preserve this life?\n\nExcessive anger harms *qi*,\nExcessive thought depletes the spirit.\nWhen the spirit is weary, the heart is easily enslaved,\nWhen *qi* is weak, illness clings.\n\nDo not let sorrow or joy reach extremes,\nBalance food and drink evenly.\nGuard against nighttime drunkenness above all,\nFor the first prohibition is the most cautious.\n\nAt the hour of *hai*, awaken to the cloud-drum’s toll,\nAt *zhen* morning, rinse with jade saliva.\nEvil spirits cannot harm you,\nWhen *qi* and essence are fully preserved.\n\nTo avoid all illness,\nAlways moderate the five pungent spices.\nCalm the spirit and spread joy,\nCherish *qi* and preserve harmony.\n\nLongevity or early death is a matter of fate,\nBut cultivation depends on oneself.\nIf you honor this principle,\nEven on level ground, you may ascend to the True.\n\n**Additional Verse by Cao Xian Gu**\nThe spirit is nature, darkness is fate—\nThe spirit wanders not, and *qi* is naturally settled.\nOriginally, these two are intimately bound,\nYet once lost, what remains as the root and handle?\n\nThe Master of Double Ninth:\nAbandoning the wakeful, he learned the madman’s way,\nAt the realm of non-action, all things are done.\nBefore the eyes, the world’s affairs are thus—\nAt the ears, thunder and wind are utterly unknown.\n\nLet the feet wander where they will,\nThe spirit ever follows the *qi*.\nSometimes the Four Great Elements intoxicate,\nAsking the blue sky: *Who am I?*\n\nReason is like tuning a zither—\nToo tight, it snaps; too slack, it fails to respond.\n[When] the slackness is just right, the zither harmonizes.\n\nAgain, like forging a sword—\nToo much steel, it breaks; too much tin, it curls.\nSteel and tin balanced, the blade is made.\n\nThe Desire Realm, the Form Realm, the Formless Realm—\nThese are the Three Realms.\nWhen the heart forgets thoughts and deliberations, it transcends the Desire Realm;\nWhen the heart forgets colored forms, it transcends the Form Realm;\nWhen the mind does not cling to emptiness, it transcends the Formless Realm.\n\nBeyond these Three Realms,\nThe spirit dwells in the land of immortals and sages,\nThe nature resides in the realm of purity and void.\n\n**Li Jing’an:**\nThe heart returns to emptiness and stillness,\nThe body enters non-action.\nMovement and stillness both forgotten,\nInner and outer merge as one.\nHere, essence naturally refines into *qi*,\n*Qi* naturally refines into spirit,\nSpirit naturally returns to the void.\n\n**Wu Xin Zhuren:**\nThe heart’s field is clear and tranquil,\nThe nature’s ground is peaceful and balanced.\nFocus the mind, straighten the body,\nNever stray from the proper place.\nThe spirit returns, *qi* is restored,\nNature is settled, essence is condensed.\nThe *po* and *hun* merge harmoniously,\nYin and yang unite in copulation.\nThe elixir field holds its treasure,\nBefore all things, the mind is empty.\nOne breath returns to the root,\nTen thousand spirits pay homage to the ancestor.\nSilent and still, holding and storing,\nVigorously ascending, continuously intertwined—\nThis is the true work of cultivation,\nThe authentic Daoist lineage.\n\n**Shi Yao Lin:**\nAll things born must die,\nThe Original Spirit dies and is reborn.\nDwelling within the *qi* as spirit,\nThe elixir Dao naturally completes itself.\nThe heart’s sky is spotless,\nThe nature’s ground is free of dust.\nIn the stillness of night, the moon bright—\nA spring crow’s cry pierces the silence.\n\n**Shi Jianwu:**\n*Qi* is the root of longevity’s medicine,\nThe heart governs the spirit’s *qi*.\nIf one knows the master of breath-work,\nThen one may become a True Person.\n\n**Zhang Ziyang:**\nHold the eye’s light, concentrate the ear’s resonance,\nRegulate the breath’s flow, seal the tongue’s *qi*—\nThis is called harmonizing the Four Symbols.\nThe eyes do not gaze, yet the *hun* is in the liver;\nThe ears do not listen, yet the essence is in the kidneys;\nThe tongue does not taste, yet the spirit is in the heart;\nThe nose does not scent, yet the *hun* is in the lungs;\nThe limbs do not move, yet the intention is in the spleen—\nThis is called the Five *Qi* ascending to the Primordial.\nEssence refines into *qi*,\n*Qi* refines into spirit,\nSpirit refines into the void—\nThis is called the Three Flowers converging at the crown.\n\nFrom void, white snow is born,\nFrom stillness, the yellow sprout emerges.\nThe jade furnace’s fire warms the damp,\nOver the cauldron, purple clouds ascend.\nOn the lotus land, flowers bloom,\nDivine water’s golden waves clash.\nDeep in the night, the moon stands clear,\nHeaven and earth mirror each other.\n\nThe dragon rises from the bound sea,\nThe tiger stirs from the western mountain.\nThe two beasts wage war,\nTransforming into the marrow of heaven and earth.\n\nThe Great Dao is originally one and without,\nIf one can guard the One, the spirit resides.\nThis heart is like a moon in a still pond—\nUnobstructed, truly free.\nWater and fire have always dwelled together,\nWhen observed, they seem present; when sought, they vanish.\n\nWith careful attention, refine both civil and martial arts,\nA single meal teaches you to forge the jade nectar.\n\nThe heart is the spirit’s dwelling,\nThe eyes are the spirit’s window.\nWhere the eyes reach, the heart follows.\nThus, the inner alchemy’s method:\nWith the eyes gazing at the nose,\nWith the nose facing the navel,\nLowering the heart-fire into the *qi* sea—\nThe work lies only in this single meal.\n\n**The Daoist of the Sea:**\nBut act when the time arises,\nAnd return to the act when gathering.\n\nThe Dragon’s exchange must not be let to sleep,\nWhen thunder and rain strike, rest is due.\nTo master the boundless fire,\nEver observe the oil yet to be spent.\n\nWhen night deepens and all disperse,\nOnly one lamp remains.\n\n**Zhu Ziyang:**\nAt utter stillness, a sigh—\nLike spring pond fish;\nAt movement’s peak, an inhalation—\nLike insects in winter hibernation.\n\nSpring fish stir with *qi*—\nTheir motion is faint;\nCold insects hold *qi* in stillness—\nTheir repose leaves no trace.\n\nThe breath-refiner must emulate this:\nSoft and dense, subtle and profound,\nExhale, and *qi* flows from every pore and orifice;\nInhale, and *qi* gathers into every pore and orifice.\nIf refined without ceasing, true *qi* will arise.\n\nThe maturity of herbs—whether fresh or aged, floating or sinking—\nThe fire’s temper—whether gentle or fierce, advancing or retreating—\nAll must be sought within true *qi*.\nAh! It is fully exhausted!\n\n**Tan Jingsheng:**\nGrief brings dual sorrow,\nAnger brings dual tears,\nIndignation causes emaciation,\nForgiveness breeds abscesses.\n\nWhere the heart desires, *qi* gathers—\nNothing escapes its cultivation.\nA crooked path leads here,\nA straight path leads there.\n\nThus the sage moderates grief and anger,\nHonestly confronts fury.\nTo grasp the gate of *qi*-gathering,\nIs to root out its source;\nTo know the pouch of the Original Spirit,\nIs to conceal its radiance.\n\nLike the pearl within the clam,\nLike the gem within the stone—\nThus is the chamber of pearls and jade formed.\n\nForget form to nourish *qi*,\nForget *qi* to nourish spirit,\nForget spirit to nourish the Void—\nOnly in this forgetting lies the realm of nothingness.\n\nThe Sixth Patriarch said:\n*\"Originally, there is no thing at all—\nWhere does dust arise?\"*\nIs this not so?\n\n**Wei Boyang:**\nThe ears are the orifices of essence,\nThe eyes are the orifices of spirit,\nThe mouth is the orifice of *qi*.\n\nIf the ears are assailed by sound,\nEssence is drained by sound and becomes unstable;\nIf the eyes are dazzled by color,\nSpirit is scattered by color and fails to condense;\nIf the mouth speaks excessively,\n*Qi* dissipates through speech and does not gather.\n\nHow then can one forge a unified whole\nTo become the elixir’s cold?\n\nThe practitioner who does not master these three critical orifices\nWill find no progress.\n\nNowadays, essence flows downward,\nDarkness disperses upward,\nWater and fire oppose each other,\nAnd cannot coalesce—\nAll due to the heart’s influence.\n\nIf the heart harbors no lustful thoughts,\nThis essence will not flow downward;\nIf the heart harbors no wrathful thoughts,\nThis darkness will not ascend in flames.\n\nWhen not a single thought arises,\nTen thousand concerns become clear—\nThen water and fire naturally unite.\n\n**Chen Xubai:**\nFrom primordial chaos emerged a round chaos—\nIts secrets cannot be spoken.\nSplit open the inner orifices within orifices,\nTread through the heavens within and beyond.\n\nThe Dipper’s handle reverses its rotation—\nOnly then does the form appear;\nThe platform’s light reverses its radiance—\nOnly then does transcendence arise.\n\nOne morning, plucking the moon from the heart’s chaos,\nPiercing the Hu’s monk through wall-sitting *chan*.\n\nThe spirit and *qi*, along with essence—\nThese are the three supreme elixirs.\nRefine essence into *qi*,\nRefine *qi* into spirit,\nRefine spirit into the Dao—\nThis is the marvel of the Seven Returns and Nine Reversions.\n\nYet the source of the elixir has its rivers and origins,\nIts gathering has its seasons,\nIts preparation has its methods,\nIts ingestion has its transformations,\nIts refining has its fire techniques.\n\nIn the southwest lies a land,\nCalled the Yellow Court—\nVaguely, something exists;\nDimly, essence lingers.\nA clear single flavor of gold within water,\nSeek it carefully in the Flower Pool.\nThis is the source of the elixir.\n\nDrawn curtains seal the *xu* orifice,\nSuppressed desires refine the breath,\nDetached from form, abandoned wisdom—\nNearly reaching *zuowang* (sitting-forgetting).\n\nI urge you to remain silent all day like the foolish,\nRefining a wish-fulfilling pearl.\nThis is the season for gathering the elixir.\n\nBefore heaven and earth,\nThere was a rootless spirit-grass,\nWith a single intention, it produced the supreme treasure.\nThe Great Dao does not depart from this inch of land—\nCultivation must be meticulous and steadfast.\nThis is the method of preparation.\n\nThe heart surges without heart,\nThoughts arise without thought,\nAttention is fixed within the rule—\nA single darkness returns to its origin.\n\nBreathing softly, never ceasing,\nMoving and sitting, ever clear.\nThis is the transformation of ingestion.\n\nRefine the elixir materials with sincerity,\nPrioritize subtle intention—\nWithin the twelve hours, darkly refine with fire.\nKeep the golden cauldron’s broth warm,\nNever let the jade furnace’s fire grow cold.\nThis is the fire technique of refining.\n\nGathering is the elixir’s fire,\nRefining is the fire’s elixir.\nTo know the elixir and contain the fire,\nThen the elixir within will naturally complete.\n\nAn ancient poem says:\n*\"The elixir’s yang is within its yin,\nThe fire’s yin is within its yang.\nUnderstanding yin-yang’s principle,\nThe fire and elixir are one.\"*\n\nThus, the spirit must govern *qi*,\nAnd *qi* must steady the breath.\nInhalation and exhalation must follow naturally,\nSoftly gathering *qi*, silently containing light—\nMoving, standing, sitting, or lying,\nSoftly enduring, as a woman with child,\nOr a dragon nurturing its pearl—\nGradually gathering, gradually refining,\nGradually疑, gradually congealing,\nUntil the work is pure and complete,\nA single *jin* forged.\nBetween motion and stillness,\nFurther adjust the ebb and flow.\n\nThoughts must not arise—\nIf they do, the fire flares;\nThe mind must not scatter—\nIf it does, the fire flickers.\n\nOnly when holding and releasing are balanced,\nWhen spirit and *qi* embrace,\nIs the fire-seed continuous,\nAnd the elixir-cauldron warm.\n\nRefining for a moment is a moment’s *Microcosmic Orbit*;\nRefining for a day is a day’s *Microcosmic Orbit*.\nNo need for child-midday-cochineal methods,\nNo need for the phases of new moon, full moon, or crescent—\nThe sage’s transmission of elixir, not fire, is exhausted here!\n\n**Qiu Changchun:**\nDo not let floating clouds obstruct the azure sky,\nFor when clouds rise, they veil all forms.\nAll forms stand arrayed, suppressing a hundred evils,\nYet brightness fails to dispel demons’ vigor.\n\nI first cleared the heavens, making them pure—\nTen thousand doors sing of great peace.\nSometimes a breath of *qi*-cloud arises,\nAnd the nine orifices, the hundred bones, are restless.\n\nThus I long taught the wise wind to rage fiercely,\nSweeping through the three realms and ten directions.\n\nWhen the clouds disperse, the void’s true body emerges,\nNaturally revealing the moon in every home.\n\nBeneath the moon, one may blow the flute,\nA single resonant note shaking the Chinese world,\nStartling the jade boys of the bound realm,\nRiding white deer like stars in flight,\nMoving freely without restraint—\nThe heart does not covet honor, the body suffers no shame.\nLeisurely singing the *White Snow* from the jar,\nAdjusting the *Yang Spring* tune from beyond the world.\n\nThe family’s melody flows all by itself—\nNo holes in the flute, no strings on the lute,\nYet when it comes, it startles the dreamer from life’s drift,\nDay and night its pure tones fill the cavernous sky.\n\n*Qi* neither ascends nor descends—\nWhen breath is still, it is called True Lead;\nThoughts neither arise nor perish—\nWhen mind is concentrated, it is called True Mercury.\n\nIf breath is even a hair unsettled,\nThe form is not mine—it scatters back to Yin,\nNot True Lead.\nIf thoughts are even a hair unclear,\nThe spirit is not pure Yang—it drifts into ghostly realms,\nNot True Mercury.\n\nThe Verdant Sovereign’s adept\nForces *qi* in vain, exhausts the spirit in labor—\nHow could he know the alchemical secret’s marvel?\nAll day he stirs the void’s true essence.\n\nThe jade nectar nourishes the spirit’s chamber,\nThe golden embryo forms at the *qi*’s pivot.\nSeek only the medicine within the body,\nNo need to consult the elixir scrolls.\n\nThe fire date has no pit, the exchange pear is unsearched—\nAll day long the fire’s alchemy proceeds,\nDivine water irrigates the golden flower.\nWhen spirit-*qi* returns to its root,\nBody and mind restore their primal mandate.\n\nSuch true orifices—\nFew know their worth.\n\nWhen the myriad sounds first stir,\nAnd the thousand mountains’ moon is full,\nSwiftly issue the true command—\nThen the Microcosmic Orbit may turn.\n\nThe cloud-dispersed sea-paeony moon,\nSpring deepens with willow winds.\nWho knows this intent?\nGazing upward, I ask the void.\n\nThe Purple Mist Hermit:\n*\"Dan* is the lotus root, *Dao* is the fish—\nForgot the root, attained *Dao*, verified the void.\nDo not cling to ‘non-action’ as fixed,\nFor even the void’s emptiness is not ‘one.’\nThe wondrous luminosity ever shines,\nEmbracing the *dharma*-realm with ease.\nResponding to green, ever pure and clear,\nThe Nine Years’ Diamond Body unbroken.\n\nThe Embracing Child:\nEars closed, the *kan* water within clarifies;\nEyes shut, the *li* fire within nurtures;\nThe mouth unspoken, the *xu* metal does not wail—\nWhen these three are sealed, the True Person plays within.\n\nChen Niwan:\nCultivating the Dao has three grades,\nRefining the elixir has three stages.\nThe highest-grade elixir method:\nUses the body as Lead,\nThe mind as Mercury,\nStillness as Water,\nWisdom as Fire—\nWithin a single meal’s time, the embryo may congeal.\n\nThe middle-grade elixir method:\nUses *qi* as Lead,\nSpirit as Mercury,\nNoon as Fire,\nMidnight as Water—\nWithin a hundred days, the form may blend.\n\nThe lowest-grade elixir method:\nUses essence as Lead,\nBlood as Mercury,\nThe kidneys as Water,\nThe heart as Fire—\nWithin a year, fusion may succeed.\n\nLi Daochun:\nTrue Lead, True Mercury—\nThe Great Elixir’s head,\nHarvested when the *wu xiang* is void.\nAction and doing bring entanglement,\nNon-seeking, non-grasping—no worry.\nEver pure, ever clear, the mind’s jewel manifests,\nForgotten things, forgotten schemes—life’s treasure unfolds.\nStillness and motion both unobstructed,\nNot leaving the ordinary is the *Yingzhou* land.\n\nThe Three Primordials’ Great Medicine—\nMind, heart, body—\nFixating on them binds you to dust.\nAdjusting breath must adjust the true breath,\nRefining spirit must not cling to spirit.\nSudden forgetting of self and things—\nThe Three Flowers gather;\nFierce abandonment of schemes and *qi*—\nThe Five *Qi* reach perfection.\nEight paths, four openings—no obstruction,\nAt every time, every place, the Perfect Truth unfolds.\n\nThe Heavenly Nature’s Great Insight roots in dust,\nThe logical path is manifold, increasing afflictions.\nCleverness and wisdom are not as good as stupidity,\nEloquent debate is not as good as silence.\nCutting off thoughts, forgetting schemes—no right or wrong,\nHiding brilliance, containing splendor—far from fame and color.\nA single thought merges, ten thousand thoughts clarify,\nThree minds then penetrate all causes and cease.\n\nExamine the Three Teachings’ sages’ books—\nThe character *xi* (息) is most sincere.\nTo work on *xi* is to be Buddha, to be immortal—no effort needed.\n*Xi* as the root of *chan*’s insight,\n*Xi* as the apex of Confucian principle,\n*Xi* as the mystery of Daoist spirit—\nThe three *xi*’s mutually support, none failing.\n\nTian Lai Zi:\nTo scoop the Northern Sea’s wave-heart moon,\nFirst bind the Southern Mountain’s ridge-clouds.\nIf someone knows this intent,\nThey may fly the crow to see the Primordial Sovereign.\nHalf the moon shines over the Western River,\nA single crow flies to the Northern Sea’s head.\nWhen the moon sets and the crow takes flight—gone,\nIn the Broad Cold Palace, riding a cow backward.\n\nThe Mysterious Female’s Gate is always open,\nWithin, one orifice blends the Spirit Platform.\nNo merchant, no lock, no guardian—\nSun and moon come and go east and west.\n\nTo gather herbs, one must know the celestial moon,\nTo cultivate, one must recognize the water-gold.\nMoon without *geng* energy, gold without water—\nEven with True Lead, effort is in vain.\n\nWu Meng Zi:\nThe body is the chariot, the heart the axle—\nWhen the chariot moves, the axle follows, no rest.\nWho is the exchange pear, the fire date?\nIt is only the uncutting of the thorns.\n\nThe body is guest, the heart the host—\nWhen the host is at peace, the guest finds rest.\nIf host and guest are not at ease,\nThe spirit-*qi* will surely depart.\n\nLongmei Zi:\nThe ferry’s light fades—*Taiqi* first appears,\nThe wind wheel stirs, producing True Lead.\nBecause stillness extreme gives rise to motion,\nIt then transforms the boundless into the finite.\nOne *qi* originates from the void’s omen,\nThe two *yi* must rotate from stillness.\nEndless generation and transformation,\nIllusionary—one cavern in the jar.\n\nZixu Leizhen Zi:\nThe Heaven-Earth key is cast aside—numbers are fixed,\n*Li* and *kan*’s knife and jade are gathered at times.\nThe Lead Dragon ascends, the Mercury Tiger descends,\nTortoise and serpent rise and fall in turn.\nThe heavenly sun revolves beneath the earth,\nThe sea’s cicada ascends to fly in heaven.\nHeaven’s and Earth’s sun and moon do not move of themselves—\nAll turn because the Dipper’s handle shifts.\nIf human heart aligns with Heaven’s heart,\nYin and Yang inverted last but a moment.\n\nAfter the Tiger and Dragon’s battle, the Three Fields are still,\nGathering the Mysterious Pearl, planting it in mud.\nThe Yellow Matchmaker unites in the Central Palace,\nThe Infant and the Female chase each other.\nAll year, daily, hourly—\nEach moment’s work is ever more wondrous.\nDarkly uniting with the Ox and the Cow,\nHeaven’s mechanism profound—few know it.\n\nYingcan Zi:\nEmbrace the Primordial, preserve the One—\nThe Mysterious Orifice opens.\nOnly the precise, only the One—\nThe Saint’s Teaching is clear.\nThe Great Mysterious, the One—\nThe return to primal mandate.\nDo not say attaining the One completes all—\nAttaining and holding, do not lose it.\n\n「One penetrates, ten thousand things merge—Heaven’s principle is clear,\nTen thousand dharmas return to the One, no wonder in this.\n\nAt first, the One gives birth to all ten thousand things,\nYet without form to sustain, they cannot endure long.\n\nIf truly all ten thousand things return to the One,\nThen one may perceive the Two Faces of the Northern Dipper.\n\nThus attaining the One and forgetting the One,\nOne may align with the creative transformation’s origin.\n\nIf one clings to the One yet cannot forget it,\nIt’s like a foolish cat guarding its den.\n\nThe Three and Five merge into the One and revert to the Void—\nAfter returning to the Void, even the Void is nonexistent.\n\nNonexistent yet not in tranquil stillness,\nThe Western barbarian’s beard is lost.\n\nNow, people call the Nonexistent “Vague,”\nYet they fearlessly tread the empty path—foolish and reckless.\n\nNow, people call the One “the One,”\nYet they strain in vain, clinging blindly to its hollow form.\n\nThe absence of *non*-absence, if understood,\nThen guarding the One and knowing the Nonexistent is effortless.\n\nThe “One” and “Nonexistent”—two words overturned,\nThe Nonexistent-One reveals the Great Mystery’s completion.\n\nIn daily life, all is Mysterious—\nYet few grasp its full meaning.\n\nEver urge the heart’s virtue,\nDiscard the empty tongue’s mantras.\n\nNot all laws are *emptiness*’s law,\nNot all transmissions are false teachings.\n\nWithout first cultivating merit,\nHow could one know of suffering’s onset?\n\nNo gain means no loss,\nNo change—how could it transform?\n\nObserve grass with care and delight,\nWhy fear the *dharma*-speech of *Dolma*?\n\nNo virtuous cause planted,\nHow could one reap the bitter fate of evil marriage?\n\nBreak the bonds of self and other,\nEscape the circle of right and wrong.\n\nCease dwelling on this life’s future,\nRelease what has not yet arisen.\n\nWith no worldly burdens left,\nWhy dread the fires of karma?\n\nBoth presence and absence stand not firm,\nVoid and reality intertwine at will.\n\nComing and going forgotten,\nLife and death—what concern have they?\n\nHunger comes, a bowl of rice,\nThirst arises, a cup of spring’s flow.\n\nWhen energy surges, let it disperse,\nWhen weary, rest without delay.\n\nThe enlightened understand this truth—\nNo need to seek a Heaven beyond Heaven.\n\nThe past is bright and vivid,\nThe end is clear and luminous.\n\n**Dao Yin Method**\nClose your eyes, sit in silent contemplation,\nGrasp and steady your mind’s essence.\n\nKnock your teeth thirty-six times,\nBoth hands embrace the Kunlun peaks.\n\nLeft and right strike the Heavenly Drum,\nTwenty-four beats resounding.\n\nSway gently, shake the Celestial Pillar,\nThe Red Dragon stirs the water’s essence.\n\nSwallow the saliva thirty-six times,\nDivine elixir fills your mouth evenly.\n\nDivide one swallow into three,\nThe Dragon’s path drives the Tiger to flight.\n\nHold your breath, rub your hands warm,\nThen massage the *Mingmen*’s gate.\n\nExpend this single breath,\nImagine fire burning your *dantian*’s wheel.\n\nLeft and right turn the *Lianhua*,\nBoth feet stretch freely.\n\nCross your hands, support the *Xu*,\nBend your head, press your feet repeatedly.\n\nWait for the reverse flow’s ascent,\nThen swallow again, repeating.\n\nThus three cycles complete,\nNine times the divine elixir is taken.\n\nSwallowing echoes softly,\nAll hundred channels harmonize.\n\nThe *Hecar*’s cart moves its load,\nFire spreads, consuming the body.\n\nEvil spirits dare not approach,\nSleep is undisturbed, never dimmed.\nCold and heat cannot penetrate,\nCalamities and illnesses cannot afflict.\n\nPractice at *ziwu*’s hour,\nAlign with the transformation of Heaven and Earth.\n\nThe cycle turns in sequence,\nThe Eight Trigrams as auspicious cause.\n\n**Du Dao Jian**\nThe Ultimate Dao is not distant—\nIt lies before you now.\n\nSteal the essence of Heaven and Earth,\nCultivate the embryo-immortal.\n\nWondrous beyond wondrous,\nConcentrate my spirit—\nRest and await it,\nAs if it exists yet is boundless.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor sought the Mysterious Pearl,\nAnd through the *xiangwang* he obtained it.\n\nThis principle may be understood by the heart,\nNot by words transmitted.\n\nAt the Void’s extreme, stillness profound,\nFaintly, transformations arise—\nTwisted and coiled like bonds,\nAs smoke and clouds swirl endlessly.\n\nDragon’s roar, Tiger’s cry,\nLead and mercury intertwine.\nSeize them in due time,\nRefine them with fire’s alchemy.\n\nSuspend the sword in the Southern Palace,\nSeal the spirit-chamber’s gate,\nRefine the five-colored stone,\nTo mend my own Azure Sky.\n\nNurture the embryo with each meal,\nCirculate fire for a year.\nLike the *Yingyang*’s embrace of its egg,\nAll cares are cast aside.\n\nRevolve the Heavenly Root’s key,\nPass through the Moon Cavern’s threshold—\nAscend and descend freely,\nFusing and flowing, the true *qi* circling threefold.\n\nDiligently practice this,\nDo not reckon gains or losses.\n\nLayer earth to build a terrace,\nAccumulate droplets to form a river.\nThe timing is rare, elusive—\nDo not wait for frost and snow to crest the peaks.\n\n**Xu Zhenren**\nBefore the gate is opened,\nEmpty sitting—no grain to mill or grind.\nWasting the spirit in vain,\nMissing the chance—life and death’s wheel cannot be evaded.\n\nWhen the gate is opened,\nThe lock is broken—\nThe Three *Hecars* transport true water and fire,\nFrom *Yongquan* to the *Mizhu Gong* Palace,\nRoaming and soaring at will, all by me.\n\nThe gate unopened, the lock undisturbed,\nDo not twist and fiddle—\nYour own life is forfeit,\nYet you prattle to others of lead and mercury.\n\nEach person has the Three Gates’ path—\nThe Spring Double Gate pierces the *Dingming* Door.\nThis is the true path of cultivation,\nFrequently swallowing the *Xiaochi*’s divine water.\n\nThe *Zifu Yuanjun* ascends in reverse,\nEver making *qi* surge through joints,\nNaturally filling the *gushen*’s valley.\n\nOnly wish the *gushen* never dies,\nThen all in the world are long-lived.\n\n**Xue Zhenren**\nThe cultivation’s art inverted,\nPractice precedes Heaven’s *kanli*’s transformation.\nSwallow the pool’s jade elixir repeatedly,\nRetrieve the golden essence from the elbow’s end.\n\nMysterious within the wondrous,\nWondrous within the Mysterious—\nObtain this divine pill,\nTo extend life’s years.\n\nThe *Guguan*’s gate sealed tight,\nThis is the mortal’s path to immortality.\n\n**Xiaoyao Zi**\nBefore parents gave birth,\nWith the Mother, my essence entwined.\nTen months within the womb,\nI moved yet could not speak.\n\nDay and night, no breath was drawn,\nYet my passage flowed through her Mysterious Way.\nWithout sentiment, I birthed sentiment,\nVoid and luminous—piercing Heaven’s depths.\n\nSever the umbilical’s thread,\nA single point roots my origin.\nLife’s essence returns to the True Soil,\nHere seek the True Lead’s source.\n\nEver guard against the *intentional* horse,\nMoment by moment, tame the *monkey*-mind.\nLose the path ahead,\nSuffer endlessly in the wheel.\n\nIf met by a clear teacher’s guidance,\nThe Mystery’s essence is revealed.\nTwenty full cycles,\nTruly ascending to Azure Sky.\n\nThe *dantian* sealed and complete,\n*Qi* returns to its root—\n*Qi* gathers, spirit condenses,\nThe Dao’s platform is established.»\n\n**The Art of Nourishing Life**\n\nTo prolong vision, begin here—\nDo not waste the fleeting *yin* of life’s bright hour.\nTo reverse aging, there are ways beyond the body’s bounds—\nNo need to seek *yin* and *yang* beyond yourself.\n\nGuard the *Mingmen* Gate with the silence of the abyss—\nWhen *qi* is steadfast and spirit whole, longevity follows naturally.\n\n**Principles of Cultivating Life**\nThe eyes are the window of the spirit,\nThe nose the gateway of *qi*,\nThe lower *dantian* the path of essence.\n\nMany gaze and deplete their spirit,\nMany breathe heavily and weaken their *qi*,\nMany indulge desires and exhaust their essence.\n\nClose the eyes to nourish the spirit,\nRegulate the breath to nourish the *qi*,\nSeal the lower *yin* to preserve the essence.\n\nWhen essence is full, *qi* abounds;\nWhen *qi* abounds, the spirit is complete—\nThis is called the Daoist Triple Treasure.\n\nAwake and align with *yang*,\nAsleep and merge with *yin*;\nAwaken often and the *hun* grows strong,\nSleep long and the *po* thrives.\n\nThe strong *hun* belongs to the living,\nThe mighty *po* to the dead.\n\nThus, those skilled in nurturing life must\nFeast on the Primordial Harmony,\nCherish flavors,\nKeep spirit clear and *qi* bright,\nStay ever awake day and night—\nThis is the path to eternal life.\n\nAvoid violent anger to preserve nature,\nMinimize thought to nourish the spirit,\nReduce speech to cultivate *qi*,\nRenounce desires to safeguard essence.\n\n**Miscellaneous Notes on the Mysterious Pass**\nOnce, a wandering Daoist met three old men\nPlucking weeds by the roadside—each over a hundred years old.\nHe bowed repeatedly and asked,\n*\"How do you attain such longevity?\"*\n\nThe eldest replied,\n*\"Within my home, my wife is plump and ugly.\"*\nThe second said,\n*\"At night, I eat just a few mouthfuls.\"*\nThe youngest spoke,\n*\"At dusk, I never cover my head.\"*\n\nAh, the wisdom of the three old men—\nThus they endure long lives.\n\nFew words in the mouth,\nFew matters in the heart,\nLittle food in the belly,\nLittle sleep at night—\nBy these four \"less,\" immortality is achieved.\n\n**True Nourishment Explained**\nLaozi said: *\"Enduring as if it exists.\"*\nTo say \"exists\" is to make it constant;\nTo say \"as if\" is to deny its existence.\nThus, the Daoist principle\nTakes the boundless void as the Primordial Cavern,\nKnowing without clinging as the method,\nAnd letting not a single thought arise as the practice.\n\nScrutinizing all *Dan* texts,\nThey reveal no other truth.\n\n*Qi* should be soft, not forceful,\nFlowing, not resisted,\nSteady, not chaotic,\nGathered, not scattered.\n\nThus, Daoists most abhor anger—\nFor when anger stirs, *qi* becomes forceful and unyielding,\nResisted and unnatural,\nChaotic and undisciplined,\nScattered and ungathered.\n\nThe cultivator must be like gentle wind and moonlit mist,\nLike auspicious stars and celebratory clouds—\nWithout a trace of perverse *qi*—\nOnly then may they perform and exert.\n\n**Secrets of True Cultivation**\nThe heart, long indulged,\nBecomes vast and forgets its source,\nYet when suddenly still,\nIt soars boundless and free.\n\nTo indulge is to honor one’s nature,\nTo still is to weary the spirit—\nHow then does one attain true tranquility?\n\nThe heart is inherently at peace,\nYet stirred by external things.\nOnce accustomed to movement, it drifts;\nOnce accustomed to stillness, it finds ease.\n\nThus, those skilled in stillness\nCalm agitation with serenity,\nTurn aside perversity with leisure,\nSuppress seeking with contentment,\nPurify turbidity with clarity.\n\nAh, how leisurely and free!\nDesire nothing, strive for nothing.\nAct thus, rest thus,\nHasten thus, wander thus—\nWith time, the external fades into obscurity,\nWhile inner discernment sharpens—\nNo need to seek stillness; it comes naturally.\n\n**The Cultivator’s First Task**\nMust be to subdue the heart.\nIf the heart is not subdued,\nHow can one perceive nature?\nIf nature is unseen,\nHow can one establish life?\nIf life and nature are incomplete,\nHow can one attain the True?\n\nThus, for every fraction of desire subdued,\nA fraction of the Dao is preserved.\n\nThe heart governs the Five *Yang*,\nThe kidneys the Five *Yin*—\nWhen the Five *Yin* ascend, they become water;\nWhen the Five *Yang* descend, they become fire.\n\nYet the navel lies at the body’s center,\nCalled the Middle Palace,\nThe Commanding Gate that encloses essence and marrow,\nLinking *qi* channels.\nThe adept, nourishing it well,\nNaturally transcends the *kan* and *li*,\nAs heart and breath depend on one another,\nMaking *yin* and *yang* harmonize—\nWater and fire in perfect balance—\nThus, the body becomes pure *yang*,\nLight and vigorous.\n\nWhen the child is in the womb,\nIt breathes as the mother breathes,\nIt inhales as the mother inhales—\nMouth and nose sealed,\nYet only the navel connects them.\n\nAt birth, the umbilical is severed,\nAnd a single point of True Primordial *Qi* gathers below the navel.\nThus, the navel is\nThe root of life, the stem of *qi*.\n\nIf one empties the heart and concentrates the spirit,\nTurning inward to illuminate the True Person’s breath,\nFeeling its rise and fall,\nFollowing its natural flow,\nMaking heart and breath interdependent,\nSpirit and *qi* inseparable—\nMoment by moment, merging as one—\nThen naturally, spirit and *qi* return to their root,\nLife and nature unite.\n\nMan dwells within *qi*,\nAs fish within water.\nWater nourishes the fish, yet the fish knows not;\n*Qi* nourishes man, yet man is unaware.\n\nTo nourish *qi*, one must first regulate the breath.\nThe method of breath regulation:\nSit still, calm the heart,\nAs serene as *chan* stillness,\nGaze at the nose like the moon,\nAlign the nose with the navel,\nAdjust breathing evenly—\nDo not let it become hurried.\nWhen inhaling, *qi* rises from below;\nWhen exhaling, *qi* descends from above.\nOne ascent, one descent—\nAs if present, as if absent—\nDo not let it falter,\nNor force it—\nSimply follow its ebb and flow,\nGently guiding it.\n\nThe body’s True Spirit dwells in the eyes,\nAnd the Five Zang’s refined essence gathers there.\nThus, the *Yin-Shu Jing* says: *\"The key lies in the eyes.\"*\nThe *Dao De Jing* says: *\"See no desires, keep the heart undisturbed.\"*\nTherefore, the method of inner nourishment\nIs to always lower the eyelids,\nTurning light inward,\nLowering the heart-fire to the *dantian*,\nHiding the spirit in the depths—\nThus, it does not stray outward,\nAnd naturally, spirit and *qi* embrace—\nLongevity is within reach.\n\n**Winter Solstice Minor Reflection**\nWithin the body, a treasure lies hidden in the *dantian*.\nLight as mist, soft as drifting smoke,\nRising to the *mimi* (brain of life),\nDescending to the *yongquan* (gushing spring).\n\nThe *qi* gathers and scatters in turn,\nNow square, now round.\nIts outer form is clear and luminous,\nSwirling left and right.\n\nWhen met with *yin*, it sinks to earth,\nWhen met with *yang*, it ascends to heaven.\nThe Golden Uncle refines mercury,\nThe Lady marvels at capturing lead.\n\nUsed according to the seasons,\nInternally simmered and brewed—\nAfter Winter Solstice, before Summer Solstice,\nThe golden cauldron’s broth boils,\nThe jade furnace’s fire blazes.\nThe Dragon and Tiger bind the peaks,\nThe Phoenix and Tiger soar to the West River.\nThe Yellow Mother acts with non-action,\nMaster Ding remains silent.\nWithin the body, the *yuan* and *jing* unite,\nClouds and rain in amorous embrace.\n\nHeaven’s One generates water,\nRooted in the pure source.\nSeparate *li* from *kan* and *wu*,\nPrioritize earth.\nEarth contains fire,\nIts secret lies in heart transmission.\n\nLike the dragon nurturing a pearl,\nWaves cradling a jade pool,\nLike the parrot brooding its egg,\nBreath slow and unhurried.\n\nThe lodestone attracts iron,\nNaturally connected.\nThe flower’s calyx holds its fruit,\nQi preserved within the core.\n\nNon-attachment yet guarding,\nAs if one thing remains.\nBeginning with *kan*,\nEnding at *qián*.\nMorning and evening baths at *mào* and *yǒu*,\nAdvance and retreat, withdraw and add.\n\nBoth *wen* and *wu* present,\nCan be molded or refined.\nThe sacred embryo formed,\nOne iron, three passes.\n\nReverse the River Chariot,\n\"Water ascending the mountain\"—\nOne master, six bandits.\nThe gallbladder shattered, the heart chilled.\n\nThe silver basin holds snow,\nUniform in hue;\nThe jade pitcher contains water,\nInstantly achieving the Great Return.\n\n---\n\n**Winter Solstice Verse**\nA single thunderclap—man stands at the crown,\nTen thousand *qing* skies, the hare’s light one wheel.\nWatching the Dipper’s handle traverse the *zhou*tian,\nSudden enlightenment to the immortal’s secret art.\n\nA single true-yang arises in the *kan* position,\nDotting the *li* official’s deficiency.\nCreation’s work is soundless—fire rising from water,\nIts marvel lies in the *xūwēi* cavity.\n\nThis year’s Winter Solstice,\nPlum blossoms clad in frozen snow.\nThe ancient sage on this day seals his retreat,\nNo comings or goings—all for the sake of all beings.\nEach thing contains the intent of life,\nEspecially at *zǐ*’s beginning and *hài*’s end.\n\nSince ancient *qián*kūn,\nThese *li* and *kǎn*—\nDay after day, without rest.\nNow seeing through it,\nThe Golden Rooster flies into the Hare’s Pass.\n\n**Song of the Mysterious Female**\nThe divine pool’s water—root of heaven and earth,\nRefined and ingested for eternal life.\nSince ancient times, immortals spoke no lies—\nAll entered the Mysterious Female’s true gate.\n\nAsk how the Mysterious Female is known:\nBefore birth, the infant’s two kidneys.\nBetween the kidneys, a single bright point—\nReverse it, and the elixir forms; follow it, and man is made.\n\nWhere true-yang first stirs, begin there—\nFrom blackness, take white; from nothingness, take being.\nSuddenly, a yellow sprout grows within the body,\nNine years, three years—only guarding in vain.\nIf mortals truly know the Mysterious Female,\nIt is neither in the heart nor in the kidneys.\nExhaust the original *qi* of the birth-body,\nDo not blame heaven’s secrets for leaking too soon.\n\n**Essentials of Cultivation**\nThe key to cultivation lies in the two characters: *xìng* and *mìng*.\nWithout them, it is a side path.\nMortals do not know what nurturing *xìng* means—\nZhongli Quan clarified it through heart-refinement.\nThey do not know what establishing *mìng* means—\nZhang Daoling and Xu Xun illustrated it through *qi*-subduing.\n\nWhen the heart dwells nowhere,\nThat is true *suchness*—this is nurturing *xìng*;\nWhen *qi* enters the body,\nSinking back to the primal sea—this is establishing *mìng*.\n\nThe Daoist school takes *jīng* (essence), *qì* (qi), and *shén* (spirit) as the three treasures of the elixir.\nYet the essence of refining *jīng* lies in the body—\nIf the body does not move, desire ceases, and essence is preserved;\nThe essence of refining *qì* lies in the heart—\nIf the heart does not move, thought ceases, and *qi* is preserved;\nThe essence of refining *shén* lies in the mind—\nIf the mind does not move, body and heart unite, returning to emptiness, and spirit is preserved.\n\nThus, *jīng*, *qì*, and *shén* are the three primal medicines,\nWhile body, heart, and mind are the three primal essentials.\n\n**End of *Chángshēng Diǎnjīng***

      "translated_text": "**Longsheng (Nirvana of Vitality) Canon**\n*Title:* **Longsheng Canon** (長生詮經).\n*Attributed to:* Unknown author. Compiled from fragments of various Daoist schools on longevity cultivation. One scroll.\n*Source:* *Continuation of the Daoist Canon* (續道藏), Huizi imprint (槐字號).\n\n**Longsheng Canon (長生詮經) – Pure Clarity Canon (清淨經)**\nA person’s spirit (神) naturally seeks purity, yet the mind (心) is disturbed by it;\nA person’s mind naturally seeks stillness, yet the passions (欲) drag it away.\nIf one habitually abandons the passions, the mind will naturally be still;\nIf one clears the mind, the spirit will naturally be pure.\nInwardly observing the mind, the mind itself is gone;\nOutwardly observing the form, the form itself is gone;\nDistantly observing all things, all things themselves are gone.\nWhen these three insights are realized, only emptiness (空) is seen.\nObserving emptiness is also emptiness—emptiness has nothing to empty.\nWhat emptiness empties, if it does not exist, then the nonexistence of nonexistence is also nonexistent.\nWhen the nonexistence of nonexistence is nonexistent, the spirit (神) is perpetually tranquil and serene.\n\n**Yinfu Canon (陰符經)**\nThe mind (心) arises from things (物) and dies from things (物); the key lies in the eyes (目).\nThe living are the root of death, and the dead are the root of life.\nKindness (恩) arises from harm (害), and harm arises from kindness.\nOne who understands this principle will not be harmed by either.\n\n**Donggu Canon (洞古經)**\nMovement arises from stillness, and action arises from non-action (無為).\nNon-action (無為) returns the spirit (神), and when the spirit returns, all things are in tranquil repose (雲寂).\nStillness (不動) extinguishes *qi* (氣), and when *qi* is extinguished, all things have no birth.\nForgetting the eyes (目) lets light overflow boundlessly;\nExtinguishing the ears (耳) lets the mind’s perception remain ever profound.\nWhen both keys are forgotten, the gates of all mysteries open.\n\nCultivate the formless (無象), and the form (象) will naturally endure;\nPreserve the bodiless (無體), and the body (體) will remain fully true.\nWhen the fully true is harmonized, longevity is achieved.\nHeaven endures because it attains its truth (真), Earth lasts because it attains its truth, and humans live long because they attain their truth.\n\n**Datong Canon (大通經)**\nStillness is its nature (性), and the mind (心) resides within it;\nMovement is its mind (心), and the nature (性) resides within it.\nWhen the mind arises, the nature is extinguished;\nWhen the mind is extinguished, the nature manifests,\nLike emptiness without form, perpetually complete and round.\n\nThe Great Dao (大道) is formless, so inwardly it is not confined by existence (有);\nTrue nature (真性) is without action (無為), so outwardly it does not generate the mind.\nThus, it flows naturally, boundless and without limit.\nFacing external phenomena while forgetting them—both do not sink into the six demons’ (六賊) illusions;\nAbiding in dust yet transcending it—one does not fall into the transformations of myriad things (萬緑之化).\nThis is the true state of equilibrium.\n\n**Dingguan Canon (定觀經)**\nOnly extinguish the restless mind (動心), do not extinguish the observing mind (照心);\nOnly concentrate the empty mind (空心), do not fixate on the abiding mind (住心).\nWith or without affairs (事), always as if without mind;\nIn quiet or in tumult, the intention remains singular.\nRestrain yet do not cling, release yet remain unmoved;\nAbide in tumult without malice, engage in affairs without vexation—this is true equilibrium (定).\nDo not seek affairs to avoid vexation, nor force tumult to avoid malice.\nTake the state of no-affairs as the true dwelling, and action (有為) as the responsive boundary.\nLike water reflecting objects, it shows form with each thing.\n\n**Taixi Canon (胎息經)**\nThe embryo (胎) forms from concealed *qi* (伏氣), and *qi* dissipates when the embryo is present.\nWhen *qi* enters the body, life is sustained; when the spirit departs, death ensues.\nKnowing that the spirit and *qi* can bring about longevity, one steadfastly preserves the void (虛無) to nurture the spirit and *qi*.\nWhen the spirit moves, *qi* moves; when the spirit abides, *qi* abides.\nIf one seeks longevity, the spirit and *qi* must be harmonized.\n\n**Taixi Inscription (胎息銘)**\nThirty-six throat openings, one must prioritize the first.\nExhaling must be subtle and refined, inhaling must be soft and continuous.\nSitting or moving, the posture must be natural and unconstrained.\nAvoid clamor, abstain from pungent or greasy foods (腥膻).\nThis is called *Taixi* (胎息, Embryonic Breath), but in truth it is *Neidan* (內丹, Internal Alchemy).\nNot only does it treat illness, but it also stabilizes the body’s equilibrium, and over time, one ascends among the immortals (上仙).\n\n**Taishang Riyong Canon (太上日用經)**\nDaily sustenance and meals: refrain from speaking, sit upright in silence,\nDo not stir a single thought, abandon all concerns, preserve the spirit and stabilize the intention.\nDo not let the eyes perceive objects, nor the ears hear sounds.\nFocus the mind inwardly, regulate the breath softly and continuously,\nGradually exhale, never forcing interruption.\nSeemingly present yet seemingly absent, the natural descent of heart-fire (心火) and ascent of kidney-water (腎水) will occur,\nSaliva will gather in the mouth, the refined essence (靈真) will attach to the body,\nAnd one will attain true longevity.\n\nWithin the twelve temporal divisions (十二時), one must always maintain purity.\nThe spirit is the child of *qi*, and *qi* is the mother of the spirit.\nLike a phoenix (鵬) guarding its egg, how can one preserve the spirit and nurture *qi* without separation?\n\n**Xinyin Canon (心印經)**\nThe three superior medicines (上藥) are spirit (神), *qi* (氣), and essence (精).\nVague yet indistinct, distant yet profound,\nPreserve the void (無) and do not cling to the form (有)—instantly achieved.\nWhen the breath (風) returns and blends, a hundred days’ practice yields results.\nSilently communing with the Supreme (上帝), after a year (一紀), one ascends in flight.\n\n**Shuihuo Canon (水火真經)**\nDesire arises from the mind (欲從心起), and breath is regulated by the mind’s stillness (息從心定).\nMind and breath are interdependent; when breath is harmonized, the mind becomes still.\n\n**Wenshi Canon (文始經)**\nWhen the mind is moved by things, no life is generated;\nWhen the mind generates, essence and function intermingle.\nThe mind does not generate life from things—only perception (識) arises;\nThings are not yet true, let alone perception—how much less emotions (情).\nThose who gaze at intricate carvings (雕琢) will lose their clarity (明);\nThose who listen to refined sounds (文響) will lose their acuity (聪);\nThose who ponder profound mysteries (玄妙) will injure their minds.\n\nTo sustain *qi* with the spirit, to sustain the form with *qi*—this is how one prolongs life;\nTo merge the form with the spirit, to merge *qi* with *qi*—this is how one conceals life.\nAbsorbing *qi* to nourish its harmony, who could ever feel hunger?\nPreserving the spirit to foster its warmth, who could ever feel cold?\n\n**Dongling Canon (洞靈經)**\nGuiding the sinews and bones (筋骨) keeps the form intact;\nPruning emotions and desires (情欲) preserves the spirit whole;\nCalming speech (言語) ensures fortune is complete.\nMaintaining these two wholenesses is the way of the sage and the worthy.\n\n**Yushu Canon (玉枢經)**\nThe Daoist enters through sincerity (以誠而入), guards through silence (以默而守), and acts through softness (以柔而用).\nUsing sincerity appears as foolishness, using silence appears as dullness, using softness appears as clumsiness.\nThose who enter the Dao know restraint (知止), those who guard the Dao know caution (知謹), those who apply the Dao know subtlety (知微).\nTo know subtlety is to generate wisdom-light (慧光), to know caution is to attain complete sage-knowledge (聖知), to know the highest is to achieve supreme tranquility (泰安定).\n\n**Chongxu Canon (沖虛經)**\nPursuing external wanderings (外遊) is not as good as inward observation (內觀).\nExternal wanderers seek completeness in things, while inward observers find sufficiency within the body.\nThe ultimate wanderer knows not where to go, the ultimate observer knows not what to see.\nSpirit meeting external forms is dream (神遇為夢), the body interfacing with affairs is reality (形接為事).\nDaytime thoughts and nighttime dreams are where spirit and form interact;\nThus, when the spirit is concentrated, thoughts and dreams naturally vanish.",

know the use of what is useful,\nYet none know the use of what is useless.\n\nThe Dao’s essence is profound and dark;\nIts utmost reaches are dim and silent.\nDo not weary your form,\nNor agitate your spirit—\nThen longevity may be attained.\nLet the eyes see nothing,\nThe ears hear nothing,\nThe heart know nothing—\nThen your spirit will guard your form,\nAnd your form will achieve longevity.\n\n**Sanmao Zhenjing (三茅真經)**\nThe valley’s emptiness responds to sound;\nThe heart’s emptiness responds to spirit;\nThe spirit’s emptiness responds to *qi*;\nThe *qi*’s emptiness responds to essence.\nWhen emptiness is extreme, clarity arises;\nWhen clarity is extreme, luminosity emerges.\nTranscending spirit and form,\nThere is no death nor life.\n\nEssence is guarded from within,\n*Qi* is generated from without—\nTo take *qi* to preserve essence\nIs the way to longevity.\n\n**Weishengjing (衛生經)**\nEssence, *qi*, and spirit are the three inner treasures;\nEars, eyes, and mouth are the three outer treasures.\nLet the inner treasures not chase after things and scatter,\nNor the outer treasures entice the mind and disturb.\n\n**Dongshen Zhenjing (洞神真經)**\nNeither honored nor humiliated—\nThe liver wood then calms;\nMoving and resting with reverence—\nThe heart fire then settles.\nDiet is moderate—\nThe spleen earth does not leak;\nBreathing regulated, speech sparse—\nThe lung metal remains whole.\nSerene and without desire—\nThe kidney water suffices.\n\n**Yuandao Zhenjing (元道真經)**\nGrasses and trees grow from roots;\nRemoved from earth, they die.\nFish and turtles thrive submerged;\nRemoved from water, they die.\nHumans live by form;\nRemoved from *qi*, they die.\nThus, the sage knows where *qi* resides\nAnd treasures it as the body’s jewel.\n\n**Han Tian Shi Yu (漢天師語)**\nThe Great Dao is void and boundless,\nPure and serene.\nUnstained is purity,\nUnmoved is stillness.\nNot seeing is serenity,\nNot hearing is tranquility.\nDiligently cultivate these four—\nThen you may avoid decline.\n\n**Pure Yang Zhenren (純陽真人)**\nA day of calm, a day of weariness;\nThe Six Spirits harmonized, naturally at ease.\nThe *dantian* holds treasure—no need to seek the Dao;\nBefore phenomena, no mind—no need to ask of Zen.\nNurture *qi* and forget speech,\nLower the heart to do nothing.\nIn motion and stillness, know the ancestral root—\nWith no affairs, whom else to seek?\n\nThe True Constant must respond to things,\nYet responding must not be deluded.\nUndeluded, nature abides;\nNature abides, *qi* returns.\n*Qi* returns, the elixir forms—\nThe vessel unites *kan* and *li*.\nYin and yang generate and return,\nUniversal transformation—one thunderous sound.\nWhite clouds crown the summit,\nSweet dew rains upon Mount Sumeru.\nDrink the elixir of longevity yourself,\nAdrift in ease—who else knows?\nSitting, listening to the soundless melody,\nIlluminated, comprehending the workings of transformation.\nTwenty lines gathered—\nTruly the ladder to heaven.\n\n**Xu Jing Tian Shi (虚静天師)**\nFear not the thoughts arising,\nOnly dread awareness lagging.\nThoughts arising are illness,\nNot continuing is the cure.\nSteady mindfulness governs impermanence—\nThe heart desires death, the machine desires life.\nThe Great Dao is not distant—it dwells within the body;\nAll things are empty, yet nature is not empty.\nIf nature is not empty, *qi* abides with it;\n*Qi* returns to the primal sea—longevity without end.\nTo keep the body’s spirit from leaving,\nDo not linger on the spirit platform with anything.\nThings in the heart scatter the spirit,\nDissipating true essence and harming sinews and bones.\nWhen the true spirit departs, retrieve it immediately—\nThe spirit returns to the body, *qi* flows back.\nThus, morning and evening,\nNaturally the赤子 bears the true embryo.\n\n**Li Zhenren (李真人)**\nInhale and lift—*qi* returns to the navel.\nLift and swallow—water and fire meet.\n\n**Sanmao Zhenjun (三茅真君)**\nThe spirit platform is clear as an ice vessel,\nOnly the true spirit may dwell within.\nIf you leave anything here,\nHow could you verify the Dao and merge with emptiness?\n\n**Han Shan Zi (寒山子)**\nIn winter, do not go hungry at dawn;\nIn summer, do not overeat at night.\nRise before the cock’s crow,\nRetire before the sun ascends.\nWhen the heart is clear, the true person guards its place;\nWhen *qi* is steady, impurities leave the body.\n\n**Yu Xu Zi (玉虚子)**\nAll things originally have no form,\nThe heart is neither form nor non-form.\nTwofold observation brings awakening—\nThe awakened do not know who they are.\nThe void of voids hides subtle existence;\nExistence of existence reveals true emptiness.\nBoth stillness and luminosity stand not,\nEver-serene nature merges.\n\n**Zhong Huang Zhenren (中黃真人)**\nThe celestial gate must always be open,\nThe earthly gate must be closed.\nBreathing softly and continuously,\nDo not let it falter for an instant.\nInhale to the roots,\nExhale to the calyx.\nThe male is called spirit,\nThe female is called *qi*.\nLike a bird brooding an egg,\nLike a fish in water.\nThe sacred embryo forms—\nNaturally, the cicada sheds its shell.\n\n**Ma Dan Yang (馬丹陽)**\nThe Dao’s nature, though unmodified and unverified,\nRequires the dust-heart to daily diminish and consume;\nUntil the heart is forgotten and nature is forgotten,\nOnly then does one align with unmodified and unverified.\nRefining *qi* as livelihood,\nCheering the spirit as daily practice.\nAlways harmonize the dragon and tiger,\nNever let the horse and monkey prevail.\nWhen nature is steady, emotions are forgotten;\nWhen the form is empty, *qi* flows;\nWhen the heart dies, the spirit is alive;\nWhen yang flourishes, yin wanes.\nCultivate the heart to be a guest of longevity,\nRefine nature to revive the dead.\n\n**Xuan Guan Milu (玄關秘論)**\nWhen the heart is entangled in affairs,\nFire stirs within.\nOnce the heart-fire moves,\nTrue essence must tremble—\nThus, kill the heart to nurture *qi*,\nExtinguish the mechanism to still necessity.\nDo nothing with the heart,\nThen the heart has no affairs—\nThus, stillness generates wisdom,\nAgitation brings confusion.\n\n**Hao Tai Gu (郝太古)**\nThe realm slays the heart—it becomes ordinary;\nThe heart slays the realm—it becomes a transcendent.\nIn stillness, refine *qi*;\nIn tumult, refine the spirit.\n\n**Wang Qi Yun (王栖雲)**\nThe heart follows phenomena, phenomena follow the heart.\nIf you wish the heart to be steady,\nDo not love what the world loves,\nDo not do what the world does.\nAmid red dust and green allure, unmoved—\nNaturally, the heart is clear and the mind serene,\nYin and yang cannot forge you.\nTo expel desire and clarify the heart is still the heart;\nTo subdue the heart to desire, desire must be profound—\nBetter than not arousing the deluded thoughts,\nRevealing the hundred-forged gold from nothingness.\n\n**Bai Yu Chan (白玉蟾)**\nThe Great Dao takes non-action as its essence,\nForgetting speech as its function,\nSoftness and weakness as its root,\nPurity and struggle as its foundation.\nReduce flavors to nourish *qi*,\nAbandon wrath and anger to nurture nature,\nDwell in lowliness to cultivate virtue,\nGuard purity to nurture the Dao.",

      "translated_text": "The true fire has no need for signs,\nThe great medicine requires no measure.\nFor the spirit is fire, *qi* is the medicine—\nRefining the medicine with fire to forge the elixir\nIs the same as the spirit governing *qi* to attain the Dao.\n\nTo make the spirit govern *qi*,\nTo make *qi* return to the spirit—\nNo more than the method of reclaiming radiance and reversing light,\nGathering the scattered threads of thought.\n\nAs for the Golden Elixir,\nIt is made by gathering the two-eights’ medicines,\nAnd gestating for three hundred days.\nThe essential practice lies not in swallowing saliva or inhaling *qi*,\nBut in the primordial transformation—\nOne must gather *qi* and condense the spirit.\n\nAll depends on practice,\nRelying on incantations,\nSimple yet profound,\nNeither complex nor difficult.\n\nFrom nothingness, nurture the infant,\nWithin the yin, forge yang *qi*.\nLet the Golden Sage capture the living tiger,\nCommand the Azure Maiden to ride the Vermilion Dragon.\nMatch the Heavenly Male with the Earthly Female through the matchmaker’s art,\nBind the Fire Maiden with the Water Male to produce the Red Child.\n\nA furnace’s flame refines the void—\nTurning into fine dust;\nA vast ice-vessel illuminates the world—\nAs small as millet grains.\n\nWhen the spirit returns to the Four Great Elements,\nIt is the moment of the Tortoise and Serpent’s union;\nWhen *qi* enters the Four Limbs,\nIt is the dwelling of the Rabbit and Hare.\n\nThe Jade Gourd bursts forth with golden fluid,\nThe Golden Sprout blooms into white jade flowers.\nAt the time when wind chimes and moonlight are clear,\nWho cares for the green hills and flowing waters?\n\nJoyous, joyous—truly joyous!\nThe void shattered, autumn hairs returned to dust—\nCountless lifetimes of death and rebirth,\nThis great death now returns to the old nest of life.\nFrom nothingness, all is stripped away—\nThe father was always the grandfather.\nDazed and confused, like a melon near the west,\nYet now it seems to recognize the bundle.\nSeventy-seven times as before, forty like a dragon nurturing a pearl—\nNever forgotten.\nLike a goose brooding an egg, *qi* unchanging,\nOr like a cicada drinking the morning breeze,\nOr like an old clam holding autumn’s chill—\nA free man asks the heavens and earth,\nLaughs once, and the heavens and earth expand.\n\nI have a bright pearl, radiant and dazzling,\nPiercing the three thousand great *chiliocosms* at dusk.\nKuan-yin’s mind is steady,\nShakyamuni’s Great Round is tight—\nOr like spring’s charm over mountains and rivers,\nOr autumn’s crispness on cliffs and divinations.\nIt is also called the Nine-Turn Great Return Elixir,\nOr the Elixir of Immortality, envied by walls and tiles.\nMuddled with water and trees, mingling with the moon’s crescent,\nThe Stone Maiden rides the Earth Ox,\nThe Lame Wooden Man astride paper—\nThe Three Poisons, the Six Roots, the Six Dusts drift like clouds.\nThis pearl’s worth is vast, yet hard to repay,\nNo clever needle may pierce it in vain.\nIf you seek the Secret Great *Dhāraṇī*,\nIn stillness, close your eyes—\nHow many children are born in silence?\nListen to the thunder beneath the pillow—\nThis Daoist hides his palm in boundless space,\nSeeking beyond the pearl.\nUnknowing of the primordial *that*, *that*—\nWhy bother with further annotations?\n\nThe cuckoo’s cry follows the morning rain,\nThe peach blossom listens to the east wind fall.\n\nThe Rabbit-Hare’s cauldron of Heaven and Earth,\nThe Tortoise-Serpent’s filthy furnace.\nThe world asks of the carefree traveler,\nWithin the heart, the Great Return Elixir.\n\nThe White Tiger roars in water,\nThe Green Dragon coils in fire.\nMercury and lead bloom like muddy flowers,\nMetal and wood freeze in snowflakes.\n\nFire and Water are not virtuous in the heart,\nBinding the west does not harm the lungs and liver.\nThirty days of exhaustion, seven returns,\nNine turns yield the mud pellet.\n\n**Master Sima**\nTo cultivate the True,\nFirst eliminate wicked deeds,\nSever all external affairs,\nLest they disturb the mind.\n\nThen, inwardly observe the Awakened King—\nWhen a thought arises, extinguish it immediately.\nArise and vanish together,\nStrive for absolute stillness.\n\nThough no greedy attachment remains,\nEven fleeting, chaotic thoughts must be eradicated.\nDay and night, diligently practice,\nWithout pause or respite.\n\nOnly extinguish the restless mind,\nDo not extinguish the luminous mind.\nBe empty yet not attached to emptiness,\nDo not cling to any method—\nYet the mind remains in its true nature.\nThis method is profound and wondrous,\nIts benefits immeasurable.\n\nPreserve the original *qi* unharmed,\nFew thoughts let the wisdom-light shine within.\nNo anger lets the hundred spirits harmonize,\nNo vexation keeps the heart’s ground cool.\nSeek nothing, yet flatter not, nor be proud.\nHold neither to round nor square,\nNor covet wealth—\nFear no king or lord.\n\nWhen tastes are abandoned, the spirit-spring descends on its own,\nWhen *qi* is settled, the true breath lengthens naturally.\nIf touched, the form dies while the spirit roams,\nIf imagined, the dream departs while the corpse stiffens.\nIf *qi* leaks, the form returns to the earth,\nIf thought leaks, the spirit drifts to the land of death.\nOnly when the heart-garden revives the spirit,\nDoes the soul’s storehouse strengthen the vital essence.\n\nTo transform phenomena exhausts subtle principles,\nTo respond to changes does not depart from the eternal.\nThe utmost refinement hides in bewilderment,\nThe great form is obscured in boundless vastness.\nCreation knows no rules or measures,\nGhosts and gods cannot fathom their retreat or emergence.\nNot drinking, not eating, yet deeply rooted—\nThis is the True Person’s *wu-wei* forgetfulness.\n\n**Master Sun**\nBetween heaven and earth, humanity is most precious—\nThe head mirrors heaven, the body mirrors earth.\nThe parents’ given form must be treasured,\nFor longevity is the highest of the Nine Categories.\n\nThe essentials of health must heed three prohibitions:\nGreat anger, great desire, and great intoxication.\nIf even one of these persists,\nBeware of losing your true *qi*.\n\nTo seek longevity, restrain your nature—\nFire does not emerge, and the heart is self-sufficient.\nWood returning to fire does not turn to ash,\nIf one restrains their nature, life extends.\n\nUnending greed forgets the essence,\nExcessive thought exhausts the spirit.\nLaboring the body scatters the harmonious *qi*—\nOn what then shall you rely to preserve this life?\n\nExcessive anger harms *qi*,\nExcessive thought depletes the spirit.\nWhen the spirit is weary, the heart is easily enslaved,\nWhen *qi* is weak, illness clings.\n\nDo not let sorrow or joy reach extremes,\nBalance food and drink evenly.\nGuard against nighttime drunkenness above all,\nFor the first prohibition is the most cautious.\n\nAt the hour of *hai*, awaken to the cloud-drum’s toll,\nAt *zhen* morning, rinse with jade saliva.\nEvil spirits cannot harm you,\nWhen *qi* and essence are fully preserved.\n\nTo avoid all illness,\nAlways moderate the five pungent spices.\nCalm the spirit and spread joy,\nCherish *qi* and preserve harmony.\n\nLongevity or early death is a matter of fate,\nBut cultivation depends on oneself.\nIf you honor this principle,\nEven on level ground, you may ascend to the True.\n\n**Additional Verse by Cao Xian Gu**\nThe spirit is nature, darkness is fate—\nThe spirit wanders not, and *qi* is naturally settled.\nOriginally, these two are intimately bound,\nYet once lost, what remains as the root and handle?",

method of preparation.\n\nThe heart surges without heart,\nThoughts arise without thought,\nAttention is fixed within the rule—\nA single darkness returns to its origin.\n\nBreathing softly, never ceasing,\nMoving and sitting, ever clear.\nThis is the transformation of ingestion.\n\nRefine the elixir materials with sincerity,\nPrioritize subtle intention—\nWithin the twelve hours, darkly refine with fire.\nKeep the golden cauldron’s broth warm,\nNever let the jade furnace’s fire grow cold.\nThis is the fire technique of refining.\n\nGathering is the elixir’s fire,\nRefining is the fire’s elixir.\nTo know the elixir and contain the fire,\nThen the elixir within will naturally complete.\n\nAn ancient poem says:\n*\"The elixir’s yang is within its yin,\nThe fire’s yin is within its yang.\nUnderstanding yin-yang’s principle,\nThe fire and elixir are one.\"*\n\nThus, the spirit must govern *qi*,\nAnd *qi* must steady the breath.\nInhalation and exhalation must follow naturally,\nSoftly gathering *qi*, silently containing light—\nMoving, standing, sitting, or lying,\nSoftly enduring, as a woman with child,\nOr a dragon nurturing its pearl—\nGradually gathering, gradually refining,\nGradually疑, gradually congealing,\nUntil the work is pure and complete,\nA single *jin* forged.\nBetween motion and stillness,\nFurther adjust the ebb and flow.\n\nThoughts must not arise—\nIf they do, the fire flares;\nThe mind must not scatter—\nIf it does, the fire flickers.\n\nOnly when holding and releasing are balanced,\nWhen spirit and *qi* embrace,\nIs the fire-seed continuous,\nAnd the elixir-cauldron warm.\n\nRefining for a moment is a moment’s *Microcosmic Orbit*;\nRefining for a day is a day’s *Microcosmic Orbit*.\nNo need for child-midday-cochineal methods,\nNo need for the phases of new moon, full moon, or crescent—\nThe sage’s transmission of elixir, not fire, is exhausted here!\n\n**Qiu Changchun:**\nDo not let floating clouds obstruct the azure sky,\nFor when clouds rise, they veil all forms.\nAll forms stand arrayed, suppressing a hundred evils,\nYet brightness fails to dispel demons’ vigor.\n\nI first cleared the heavens, making them pure—\nTen thousand doors sing of great peace.\nSometimes a breath of *qi*-cloud arises,\nAnd the nine orifices, the hundred bones, are restless.\n\nThus I long taught the wise wind to rage fiercely,\nSweeping through the three realms and ten directions.\n\nWhen the clouds disperse, the void’s true body emerges,\nNaturally revealing the moon in every home.\n\nBeneath the moon, one may blow the flute,\nA single resonant note shaking the Chinese world,\nStartling the jade boys of the bound realm,\nRiding white deer like stars in flight,\nMoving freely without restraint—\nThe heart does not covet honor, the body suffers no shame.\nLeisurely singing the *White Snow* from the jar,\nAdjusting the *Yang Spring* tune from beyond the world.",
      "overlap_context": "th careful attention, refine both civil and martial arts,\nA single meal teaches you to forge the jade nectar.\n\nThe heart is the spirit’s dwelling,\nThe eyes are the spirit’s window.\nWhere the eyes reach, the heart follows.\nThus, the inner alchemy’s method:\nWith the eyes gazing at the nose,\nWith the nose facing the navel,\nLowering the heart-fire into the *qi* sea—\nThe work lies only in this single meal.\n\n**The Daoist of the Sea:**\nBut act when the time arises,\nAnd return to the act when gathering.",

True Mercury.\n\nIf breath is even a hair unsettled,\nThe form is not mine—it scatters back to Yin,\nNot True Lead.\nIf thoughts are even a hair unclear,\nThe spirit is not pure Yang—it drifts into ghostly realms,\nNot True Mercury.\n\nThe Verdant Sovereign’s adept\nForces *qi* in vain, exhausts the spirit in labor—\nHow could he know the alchemical secret’s marvel?\nAll day he stirs the void’s

Nature’s Great Insight roots in dust,\nThe logical path is manifold, increasing afflictions.\nCleverness and wisdom are not as good as stupidity,\nEloquent debate is not as good as silence.\nCutting

one must recognize the water-gold.\nMoon without *geng* energy, gold without water—\nEven with True Lead, effort is in vain.\n\nWu Meng Zi:\nThe body is the chariot, the heart the axle—\nWhen the

it comes naturally.\n\n**The Cultivator’s First Task**\nMust be to subdue the heart.\nIf the heart is not subdued,\nHow can one perceive nature?\nIf nature is unseen,\nHow can one establish life?\nIf life and nature are incomplete,\nHow can one attain the True?\n\nThus, for every fraction of desire subdued,\nA fraction of the Dao is preserved.\n\nThe heart governs the Five *Yang*,\nThe kidneys the Five *Yin*—\nWhen the Five *Yin* ascend, they become water;\nWhen the Five *Yang* descend, they become fire.\n\nYet the navel lies at the body’s center,\nCalled the Middle Palace,\nThe Commanding Gate that encloses essence and marrow,\nLinking *qi* channels.\nThe adept, nourishing it well,\nNaturally transcends the *kan* and *li*,\nAs heart and breath depend on one another,\nMaking *yin* and *yang* harmonize—\nWater and fire in perfect balance—\nThus, the body becomes pure *yang*,\nLight and vigorous.\n\nWhen the child is in the womb,\nIt breathes as the mother breathes,\nIt inhales as the mother inhales—\nMouth and nose sealed,\nYet only the navel connects them.\n\nAt birth, the umbilical is severed,\nAnd a single point of True Primordial *Qi* gathers below the navel.\nThus, the navel is\nThe root of life, the stem of *qi*.\n\nIf one empties the heart and concentrates the spirit,\nTurning inward to illuminate the True Person’s breath,\nFeeling its rise and fall,\nFollowing its natural flow,\nMaking heart and breath interdependent,\nSpirit and *qi* inseparable—\nMoment by moment, merging as one—\nThen naturally, spirit and *qi* return to their root,\nLife and nature unite.\n\nMan dwells within *qi*,\nAs fish within water.\nWater nourishes the fish, yet the fish knows not;\n*Qi* nourishes man, yet man is unaware.\n\nTo nourish *qi*, one must first regulate the breath.\nThe method of breath regulation:\nSit still, calm the heart,\nAs serene as *chan* stillness,\nGaze at the nose like the moon,\nAlign the nose with the navel,\nAdjust breathing evenly—\nDo not let it become hurried.\nWhen inhaling, *qi* rises from below;\nWhen exhaling, *qi* descends from above.\nOne ascent, one descent—\nAs if present, as if absent—\nDo not let it falter,\nNor force it—\nSimply follow its ebb and flow,\nGently guiding it.\n\nThe body’s True Spirit dwells in the eyes,\nAnd the Five Zang’s refined essence gathers there.\nThus, the *Yin-Shu Jing* says: *\"The key lies in the eyes.\"*\nThe *Dao De Jing* says: *\"See no desires, keep the heart undisturbed.\"*\nTherefore, the method of inner nourishment\nIs to always lower the eyelids,\nTurning light inward,\nLowering the heart-fire to the *dantian*,\nHiding the spirit in the depths—\nThus, it does not stray outward,\nAnd naturally, spirit and *qi* embrace—\nLongevity is within reach.\n\n**Winter Solstice Minor Reflection**\nWithin the body, a treasure lies hidden in the *dantian*.\nLight as mist, soft as drifting smoke,\nRising to the *mimi* (brain of life),\nDescending to the *yongquan* (gushing spring).",
