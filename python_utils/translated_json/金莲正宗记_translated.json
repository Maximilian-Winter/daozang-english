Though the doctrine existed, only seventy-two followed it in practice.\nLater, in the reign of King Wǔdīng of the Shang, the Old Master manifested at Lèiyáng, traversing the Wei Pass to the east and the Flowing Sands to the west, teaching for nine hundred ninety-six years. Then, astride a white deer, he ascended the Azure Cypress, transcended the Azure Deeps, and wandered the Jade Capital.\nYet despite such marvels, people still doubted and failed to embrace the truth.\n\nWhen the Han Celestial Master Zhāng Jìngyìng emerged, he personally received the Orthodox One Scripture, battling demons to establish the Blessed Court, ordaining Daoists as the Sacrificial Master. His teachings flourished, transforming the four seas.\nHe was succeeded by Kǎo, Hào, Dù, and Yè, who exorcised demons and dispelled calamities, accumulating blessings and averting disasters, aiding the state and saving the people, acting as Heaven’s emissaries. For countless generations, monasteries thrived, and emperors revered them.\nAfter the Zhenghé era, the Lin Celestial Master repeatedly displayed divine transformations, and the emperor took faith in him. Though the teachings prospered, the doctrine of nature and life remained obscured and unexplored.\n\nThen, at the end of the Flaming Song dynasty, Zhòngyáng emerged anew, reviving the teachings and focusing solely on nature and life. He transformed the Three Zones and united the Five Assemblies, placing the Golden Lotus at the forefront. Wandering the seas, he initiated seven disciples, embodying gentleness and humility outwardly, quietude and emptiness inwardly, the Nine Returns and Seven Reversions in essence, and myriad transformations in adaptability. He renamed the school *Quánzhēn* (Complete Reality) and altered the robes to incorporate the Eight Trigrams.\n\nWhen our Long Spring Master Qiū Shénxiān received the emperor’s summons and answered the invitation from Yīnshān, he admonished against excess in wine and desire, warned against excessive slaughter, and with a single sincere word, brought spring to ten thousand nations. He rescued countless souls from the brink of suffering, and all hearts turned toward him as rivers flow to the sea. The sturdy and the youthful alike bowed in reverence, while the barbarians of the east and west composed hymns to *Bùxū* (the Uncarved). Families discussed the Dao and Virtue, and everywhere, the teachings of *Xīyí* (the Mysterious and Profound) were expounded. Lazy robes and unbound hair filled the roads, while jade halls and celestial altars dotted the mountains and valleys. Since the time of Xuānxu, no era has seen the Daoist path flourish as it does today.\nThis teaching originates from Zhōnghuá (Central Harmony), flourishes under Zhòngyáng, and branches from Chángchūn. From this point onward, its influence will surge like an overflowing river, its limits unknown. Thus, *The Golden Lotus Orthodox Record* is composed.\n\nWritten in the year *Sīnchǒu* (1231), the *Píngshuǐ* era, under the *Chángchūn Hútian* banner.\n\n---\n**East华 Emperor-Jun (Dōnghuá Dìjūn)**\nThe Emperor-Jun bore the surname Wáng, with the courtesy name Xuánfǔ, and the Daoist title Zhōnghuá Zǐ.\nFrom birth, he exhibited extraordinary bearing, and in youth, he revered the Daoist Way. The Upper True One of White Clouds saw and loved him, saying: *\"A celestial exile sent down from Heaven.\"*\nHe was then led into the mountains, where he received the Green Talismans and Jade Seals, the Golden Precepts and Sacred Scriptures, the Great Elixir’s secret formulas, and the Fire Controller’s Green Dragon Sword method of the Nine Heavens.\nThe Master treasured these teachings with devotion, and after three years of diligent study, mastered their profundities.\nHe then retired to the Yānjiàn Mountains’ Misty Ravine, nurturing his spirit and cultivating his essence.\nAfter some time, he built a thatched hut and dwelled there, inscribing the plaque as *Zhōnghuá Guān* (Central Harmony Monastery). For over a hundred years, he concealed his light and hid his traces, unknown to the world.\nLater, he moved to the southern mountains of Dài State’s Wǔtái, where the Purple Treasury Celestial Cavern now stands, and below, the Daoist County.\nThough he lived among mortals for hundreds of years, he showed no signs of aging. He expounded the Mysterious Sovereign’s teachings, elucidating their wonders, performing hidden deeds for the benefit of all, and his virtue moved Heaven itself. Thus, the Celestial True One bestowed upon him the title *Zhōnghuá Dìjūn* (East华 Emperor-Jun), also called the *Minor Yang Sovereign of the Purple Treasury*.\nHe initiated his disciple, the Pure Yang True Person Zhōnglí Yúnfáng, to succeed and propagate the teachings.\nThe sacred and distant cannot be fully recorded here. The Quánzhēn Dao originates from him, hence he is established as the **First Ancestor of Complete Reality**.\n\nA scholar remarked: *\"The Emperor-Jun’s celestial name is so resplendent, his Daoist worth so towering—why is he not recorded in the Han histories? His lineage, birthplace, and deeds are so obscure.\"*\nI respond: *\"Daoist cultivation often involves seclusion. It is not the urgent priority of establishing teachings for the world, so historians omit or lose track of such figures. Moreover, Confucian scholars disdain speaking of such matters. Over time, inscriptions fade, and thus, we cannot fully discern them.\nEven in the four hundred years of the Han dynasty alone, the number of recluses and hermits is incalculable. How could a few thousand scraps of paper ever record them all?\"*\n\nThe Dao/Way of Complete Reality has long been brewing. From the **Celestial Worthy** it was passed down to **Golden Mother**, then to **White Cloud**, and finally to **Imperial Sovereign** (帝君). Heaven, in its intent, entrusted this grand teaching to such a one—how could mere pedants ever bear its weight? Emerging from the **Crimson Cloud and Vermilion Landscape** (紅霞丹景), he was carefully selected as the leader of all the immortals, then descended to the mortal realm.\n\nAt first, his arrival was not without marvelous and extraordinary signs—his radiance dazzling Heaven and Earth! Yet they were hidden and not recorded, for historians dread such things. Thus, they are explicitly stated at the end of the transmission, lest scholars read them without proper reflection.\n\nThe verse says:\n*\"Obscurely rising, the Dragon Tower veiled in misty auspicious clouds,\nThe refined elegance of the Purple Palace, the Minor Yang’s abode.\nKunlun looms high, its radiance stretching a thousand feet,\nWhen first it blooms, the Complete Reality’s foremost flower.\"*\n\n**Zhònglí True Person of Rectified Yang** (正陽鍾離真人) reverently notes from *The Record of Lu Mountain’s Golden Spring Observatory* (《庐山金泉观记》):\n*\"His great-great-grandfather, surname **Pu** (朴),\nHis grandfather, surname **Shǒudào** (守道),\nHis father, surname **Yuán** (源),\nAll during the late **Later Han** (後漢) era,\nHeld strategic positions, with merit to the nation,\nTheir virtues enduring through generations.\"*\n\nThe Master, surname **Zhòng** (鍾), given name **Quán** (權), courtesy name **Yúnfáng** (云房), styled **Zhònglí** (正陽子), was a native of **Hànchāng Xiànyáng** (京兆咸阳).\n\nYoung, he excelled in letters and calligraphy, especially favoring the **Grass Script** (草圣). His height was eight feet seven inches, his beard extended past his navel, and his eyes held divine light.\n\nHe rose to the rank of **Left Advisor** (左谏议大夫), but after submitting a memorial criticizing **Li Jiān’s** (李坚) mismanagement of border affairs, he was exiled as **Commander of Nánkāng** (南康知军). After the **Han** (漢) dynasty fell, he again served under the **Jìn** (晉).\n\nDuring the reign of **Emperor Wǔ** (武帝), he led troops alongside the general **Zhōuchù** (周处), but their campaign faltered, and they fled into the chaotic mountains, their whereabouts unknown. Chance led him to encounter a **Laozi** (老氏) adept, who, when questioned, remained silent but pointed toward **Bùnán** (束南). He immediately journeyed there.\n\nAfter six or seven miles, towering peaks rose abruptly, pine and cypress trees stood in uneven ranks, and within, a pavilion gleamed with golden splendor, its radiance awe-inspiring. Two **Qīngyī** (青衣) attendants stood at the gate, and he bowed, asking: *\"What place is this?\"*\n\nThey replied: *\"The dwelling of the Minor Yang Sovereign of the Purple Palace (紫府少陽君),\nAnd the secondary estate of the **Bùhuá Imperial Sovereign** (束華帝君).\nYour teacher, **Hóu Jūn** (侯君), has long resided here.\"*\n\nThey then invited him inside, where he bowed and saw the **Imperial Sovereign** (帝君). As they conversed and laughed, a boy announced: *\"A guest-immortal has arrived!\"*\n\nThe **Imperial Sovereign** (帝君) went out to greet the three immortal guests. **Zhònglí** (鍾離) peered from the window and saw:\n*\"The first immortal stood eight feet tall,\nWearing green robes with white sashes,\nGrass sandals and a cloud-patterned cap,\nHis eyes flashing with divine light—majestic indeed!*\n*The second, clad in a plain white robe with wide sleeves,\nTied behind his neck, held a iron flute across his chest.*\n*The third, robust and imposing,\nWore a crimson robe, a **Huáyáng** (華陽) headwrap,\nStraddled a **Cāngmáo** (苍毛) tiger,\nAnd grasped a staff horizontally.\"*\n\nThey then led the three immortals into the secondary hall, offering wine, fruits, and fine dishes. Their laughter and camaraderie echoed beyond the hall.\n\nThe **Qīngyī** (青衣) asked:\n*\"How many dusty guests arrive here?\nBy what means do they come?\nThe cave’s door lacks locks or keys—\nFor whom is it opened today?\"*\n\nThe immortals all laughed:\n*\"Once you were **Tiěyī** (鐵衣) child,\nNow you meet one who has attained the Dao/Way (達道人).*\n*How dare a mighty warrior intrude upon this sacred ground!\"*\n\nThe **Iron Flute Immortal** (鐵笛仙) said:\n*\"The Minor Yang’s Purple Palace,\nThe Dragon Tower veiled in misty auspicious clouds,\nPouring cups of wine aged a thousand days,\nEver blooming flowers of the four seasons—*\n*Let the **Rú** (阮) family enjoy them!\"*\n\nThe **Tiger-Riding Immortal** (跨虎仙) said:\n*\"Your teacher personally points the way to **Pénglái** (蓬莱),\nWhy seek further guidance?\nThe immortals know their destined paths—\nFortunate indeed to bow before the High True One!\"*\n\nThe **Imperial Sovereign** (帝君) replied:\n*\"Noble are you, O **Qīngyún** (青云) vessel,\nOur meeting brings joy to my face.\nThe **Red Terrace** (丹台) has its records,\nYet I have been temporarily exiled among mortals.\"*\n\nThe immortals all drank deeply, then departed. The **Imperial Sovereign** (帝君) saw them off, each ascending to the sky astride a **Luán** (鸾) or **Fèng** (凤) with effortless grace. The **Imperial Sovereign** (帝君) then returned and spent the entire day in profound discussion with **Zhònglí** (鍾離), their bond of affection deeper than that of old friends.\n\nHe then transmitted to him:\n*The **Red Seal and Jade Inscription** (赤符玉篆),\nThe **Golden Precepts and Sacred Writings** (金科灵文),\nThe **Great Elixir Secrets** (大丹秘诀),\nThe **Fire Marshal of the Five Circuits** (周天火侯),\nAnd the **Green Dragon Sword Method** (青龙剑法).\n**Zhònglí** (鍾離) reverently received these teachings,\nAnd upon hearing them once, his understanding reached a thousandfold.*\n\nAfter mastering their depths, he bid farewell and descended the mountain, wearing a simple **Zhuīzì** (椎髻) hairstyle and coarse garments. He practiced **accumulating virtue** (积行) to save others, refined his **spirit** (调神) and cultivated his **qi** (炼气), his transformations ever unpredictable.\n\nDuring the **Kāichéng** (开成) era of **Emperor Wénzōng** (文宗) of the **Táng** (唐), while wandering **Lúshān** (庐山), he encountered **Lǚ Gōng** (吕公), the **Cave Guest** (洞宾), who taught him the **Heavenly Escape Sword Method** (天遁剑法), and he called himself the **Scattered Daoist of All Under Heaven** (天下都散汉).\n\nLater, he secluded himself at **Yángjiǎo Shān** (羊角山) in **Jìn** (晉), where the **Celestial Worthy** (天真) bestowed upon him the title **Tàijí Zuǒgōng Bǎoshēng Zhēn rén** (太极左宫保生真人).\n\nHe once inscribed two poems behind the **Guan’āyī Hall** (观音殿) at **Qǐngzhōu Kāiyuán Temple** (邢州开元寺), their strokes soaring like dragons in flight. The poems read:\n*\"To meet a true immortal is no easy thing,\nWhen shall I return, and wish to follow you?\nMy dwelling connects with the **Stárng** (沧) Sea,\nA separate peak, the foremost of **Pénglái** (蓬莱).*\n*Again it says:\nDo not weary of joyous pursuits and frequent laughter,\nYet ponder the sorrows of separation and strife.\nIn leisure, I count with bent fingers from the start,\nHow many have attained **Qīngpíng** (清平)?\"*\n\nIn the **Sòng** (宋) dynasty, **Liú Cóngguǎng** (刘从广) erected a stone stele and had it inscribed during the **September Ninth** (九月九日) of the **Huángyòu** (皇佑) era, the fourth year. There is also an ode that reads:\n*\"To see money as a plague, O True Immortal Child,\nTo meet women with the bearing of a virtuous gentleman.\nCultivating **qi** like a turtle’s slow breath,\nRefining the form to resemble a crane’s skin.\nBorn at the gate of life, yet die at the door of death—\nHow many are the awakened, how many the enlightened?\nLast night, the Iron Warrior pondered deeply,\nLong life and immortality—by whom are they achieved?\"*\n\nHe also compiled *The Collection of True Immortals Transmitting the Dao/Way* (《真仙传道集》) alongside *The Sacred Treasures of the Lingbao* (《灵宝毕法》), passing them to **Lǚ Gōng** (吕公). He spoke of the **Dao/Way of Internal Elixir** (内丹养命), where **Yīn** and **Yáng** harmonize within the **Great Transformation of Heaven and Earth** (天地造化), hidden in the **Mystic Treasury of the Dark Realm** (玄都宝藏) as a mirror for all ages.\n\nAfterward, he again visited **Lúshān** (庐山), ascending the **Three-Level Vermilion Pavilion** (三级红楼) and effortlessly rising into the sky on the **twentieth day of the fifth month** (五月二十日).\n\nThe eulogy states:\n*\"The Dao/Way cannot be attained through empty deceit,\nNor can immortality be achieved through falsehood—\nOnly true practice and genuine cultivation are honored.\"*\n\nBefore his enlightenment, **Zhèngyáng Zǐ** was but a warrior clad in iron armor. Yet after paying homage to **Bùshù Huà Dìjūn**, he received the **Jade Seal of Authority** to commune with Heaven, followed the **Golden Precepts** to move the Earth, forged a sword so that the **Azure Dragon** entered its sheath, and refined the elixir so that the **Crimson Phoenix** ascended to the Primordial. He cultivated **qi** until his breathing resembled that of a tortoise, and refined his form until his skin was like a crane’s. Over five hundred years—from the Han to the Tang—only one **Pure Yang** Immortal was granted transcendence. How rare it is for mortals to be transformed!\n\nLater, he wandered **Lúshān**, ascending the **Three-Level Vermilion Pavilion** and drifting upward into the **Great Void**. From then on, the **Quánzhēn** teachings gradually took shape, and thus he became the **second patriarch of the Jīnlián Orthodox Line**.\n\nThe verse says:\n*\"Once heard the Iron-Flute Immortal astride a tiger,\nNow the Golden Elixir passed from the Celestial Sovereign.\nAt parting, he entrusted it to Pure Yang Zǐ—\nOn the Three-Level Vermilion Pavilion, beneath the azure sky.\"*\n\nAccording to the *Record of the Stone Inscription at Yuezhou Qingyang Observatory*, his great-grandfather was named **Jǐng**, rising to the rank of **Hanlin Academician and Grand Guardian of the Imperial Library**. His grandfather, **Xiàn**, held the post of **Governor of Henan Prefecture**, and his father, **Wèi**, served as **Minister of Rites**. The Master himself was named **Yán**, with the courtesy name **Dòngbīn**, a native of **Púyì, Pú Prefecture** (modern-day **Púyì, Yǒnglè**).\n\nBorn on the **fourteenth day of the fourth month, in the year Gēngzǐ of Emperor Dèzōng’s Xīngyuán era (827 CE)**, beneath a tree in the **Forest of Birds**, he later achieved the **Jìnshì degree in the year Dīngyǒu of Emperor Wénzōng’s Kāichéng era (840 CE)**, at the age of twenty-two. With a **dragon-like bearing and phoenix-like eyes**, his sparse yet refined brows and beard bore the **metallic and waterly marks** of destiny. He wore the **Huáyáng cap** and **Xiāoyáo robes**, his demeanor resembling that of **Zhāng Zǐfáng** or **Sīmǎ Qiān**.\n\nLater, he served as **Magistrate of Lúshān’s Wǔfēng County**, and during his leisure, he explored the mountain’s wonders. There, he met **Zhèngyáng Zǐ**, and after exchanging but a few words, their hearts aligned. He received the **Great Dao of Heavenly Escape Swordsmanship** and the **Dragon-Tiger Golden Elixir’s Secret Scriptures**, and was bestowed the title **Pure Yang Zǐ**.\n\nFrom that point onward, he resigned his office and titles, devoting himself entirely to the **Dao/Way**, their bond unbreakable as **glue and lacquer**. Soon after, several Immortals personally invited him to the **Gathering of Penglái**. **Lǚ Gōng**, tears streaming, knelt and pleaded with his master: *\"When shall we meet again in the Cloud-Car?\"*\n\nHe then composed a poem in reply:\n*\"At the moment of fulfillment, reunion is hard to find,\nYet now I hear you depart for the Celestial Platform.\nA staff-top spring in a goblet of wine,\nA crown of clouds piercing the Five Peaks.\nThe Tortoise of the Sea knows no man,\nThe符符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*\n\nAfter this, **Lǚ Gōng** hid himself in Shìyáe, sometimes selling elixir to cure the sick and relieve their sufferings, sometimes offering ink to aid the poor. Through accumulated merit and righteous deeds, he ultimately attained true **Dao/Way** mastery, his transformations boundless—now hidden, now revealed. He often traveled between Cāngwú and Nányuè, and once wrote a poem:\n\n*\"Morning I wander in the Southlands, evening in Cāngwú,\nMy sleeves hold the **qi** of a green serpent, bold and vast.\nThree times I entered Yùyáng, yet none recognized me,\nHighly reciting as I flew over Dòngtíng Lake.\"*\n\nDuring the **Song Dynasty**’s Zhènghé era, the **Lǚ Gōng** of Luòyáng’s Shàngqīngguān inscribed two couplets:\n\n*\"I came twice to pay homage to the Three Pure Ones,\nYet the myriad beings of the Four Great Elements see them not.\nNow I return to the dusty world below,\nIn the depths of the Five Clouds, the **Dao/Way**-realm points.\"*\n\nAnd again:\n\n*\"In the depths of the Five Clouds lies my homeland,\nBeyond the Four Great Elements—no longer can I dwell.\nToday I know not if I am a guest,\nFor tomorrow I’ll remain here, beside.\"*\n\nDuring the **Wùzǐ** year’s Mid-Autumn Festival, a practitioner of the **Dao/Way** came to visit **Lǚ Gōng** at his residence in Xījīng. The host obstructed him, but **Lǚ Gōng** was already seated in the hall with an imposing presence. He said, *\"I beg a hundred cups of wine.\"* The host granted them, and he drained them in one sitting. Then he requested three *chǐ* of plain silk, which he dipped in wine, folded, and placed in the bottle before departing without farewell. The host quickly ordered a pursuit, but **Lǚ Gōng** had vanished. Upon opening the bottle and unfolding the silk, they found a painted image—his likeness without distinction, **Dao/Way**-clear and refined, with three fine hairs protruding from his ears. Later, he inscribed two more couplets:\n\n*\"To nourish life, one must drink a hundred cups,\nTo cultivate longevity, let the **Yellow River’s clarity** be the measure.\nThe **Dao/Way** renews itself each day with boundless wisdom,\nThe **Way** unfolds early, as thunder splits the earth’s core.\"*\n\nAnd again:\n\n*\"A body of **obstinate freedom** through ages past,\nYet only the **Supreme Good** can reveal its truth.\nHow many thoughts and deeds I’ve received from your teaching,\nNow floating in the **Dao/Way**-realm, leaving the mundane behind.\"\nHe was later titled **Pure Yang Master**.\n\nDuring the **Xuānhé** era of the **Song Dynasty**, at **Dàiyuèguān** in **Tàishān**, he inscribed a couplet on the stone wall:\n\n*\"Long ago I left my mark here when I came,\nNow my deeds fulfill the Nine Regions of the world.\"*\n\nLater, when thunderous rains struck and **dragon-kind** battled in the skies, the mountain’s cliffs crumbled—yet **Lǚ Gōng**’s ink traces remained untouched. Ninety years later, when another visitor returned, he inscribed another couplet:\n\n*\"The dragons know my intent, so leave no trace,\nThey spare my mark from being buried deep.\"*\n\nAnd again, a single stanza:\n\n*\"Long ago I wandered here,\nNinety springs have passed since then.\nHow many dusty travelers,\nWho would recognize me now?\"*\nHe later signed it as *\"Huígōng’s work.\"*\n\nHis manifestations varied with each place, too numerous to record. In his lifetime, he wrote hundreds of works, collectively titled *The Sword Transmission Anthology*. His soaring transformations were countless—those who followed him could not fathom their number.\n\nLater, in his travels to **Èzhōu**, ascending the **Huánghè Lóu** at noon on the twentieth day of the fifth month, he rose into the clouds, his form barely visible. The common folk gazed in awe, yet only saw him vanish into the mist.\n\nThe praise reads:\n\n*\"From ancient times, those who attained the **Dao/Way** and became Immortals were many, yet why does **Lǚ Gōng**’s name alone stand out? It is because his heart of **compassion and mercy** extends to all, benefiting beings without limit, and touching them most deeply. Even the **old pine’s essence**—a lifeless thing—was taught with care, transformed into the **Supreme God**. How much more so for humans, the most refined of all beings!\n\nThree times he entered **Yùyáng**, bearing the **elixir’s longevity** for a thousand years.\nRevisiting **Dàiyuèguān**, he recited the *Sutra of the Yellow Court* in the two halls.\nHe sought the **essence** of the **Red Phoenix** in the southern lands,\nAnd the **marrow** of the **Black Tortoise** from the northern seas.\nOne grain secures transcendence beyond the world,\nNine refineries scatter blessings among all.\nHe turned stones into gold with a touch,\nAnd willow branches into bones with a fold.\nThose who took his elixir regained youth and vitality,\nThose who met him rose from death, their bodies restored.\n\nA hundred strange forms concealed him,\nHis sleeves held the **Dao/Way**-sword of a green serpent.\nA decree from the Nine Heavens descended,\nHis body flew from the **Huánghè Lóu**’s heights.\n\nThus it is said: a name is a public treasure of the world,\nNot to be claimed by many—how true it rings!\"*\n\nThe poem reads:\n\n*\"Three *chǐ* of green serpent **qi** chills the heart,\nHeaven and Earth shift at my touch.\nOnce I left from the **Huánghè Lóu**’s peak,\nLeaving behind **elixir** for mortals to trade.\"*\n\n**Master Sìu of the Sea Hare**\nThe Master’s surname was **Sìu**, his given name **Cāo**, with the courtesy name **Zōngchéng**, and the sobriquet **Hǎi’án Gōng**. He was a native of **Yànshān**.\n\nAt sixteen, he was selected in the **Míngjīng** examination for the **Jiǎkē** rank, advancing through promotions to the position of **Chancellor**. He always favored discussions on **nature and life**, yet never grasped their profound mysteries.\n\nOne day, a **Daoist** came to pay respects. The Master invited him to sit in the hall, treating him as a honored guest, and asked for his name. The visitor remained silent, only calling himself **Zhèngyáng Zǐ**, and requesting ten **parrot eggs** and a single **gold coin**. The Master placed the coin on his palm and stacked the eggs high, precariously balanced—yet they did not fall.\n\nThe Master sighed, *\"Perilous indeed!\"*\n\nThe visitor replied, *\"Your Excellency’s life and fortune are both in greater peril than this.\"*\n\nThe Master awoke to the truth, and the visitor then gathered the eggs and hid them, while discarding the coin. He then bade farewell and departed.\n\nThe Master thereupon hastened to arrange a nightly banquet, feigning intoxication. He hurled cups, plates, and treasures to the ground, shattering them. His wife and children, along with servants, all angrily rebuked him.\n\nYet even after the morning court session, his face remained grim. He untied his official seal and resigned from office, then acted madly, singing and dancing.\n\nHe composed a song of his own, saying:\n\n*\"I, the **Lǜ Tàisuì**, was born in Yàn,\nRecalling how the **Three Lights** shared their **qi** with me.\nIn the **Mǎo Angle**’s brilliance, my heart stood clear as frost and snow,\nAt sixteen, I swiftly ascended to the **Jìakē** rank.\n\nWith **Jū** and **Zǐ** robes, I bore the **golden seal**’s honor,\nWhile others adorned themselves in **embroidered silks**, their bodies lightly encumbered.\nNow my station reaches the **highest** of **official seals**,\nYet in a blink, all past joys are lost—like a spring dream’s fleeting sigh.\n\nLast night, at the third watch, the family feast was grand,\nMy brother, sister, and wife all waited upon me like servants.\nI feigned drunkenness, overturning cups and plates,\nSmashing **coral** and **precious jade** treasures to dust.\nChildren scorned me, my wife loathed me,\nThey forgot the past pleasures of clothing, food, and ease.\n\nThis morning, my anger still lingers at court’s retreat,\nFor even a minor fault, I dare not excuse.\nFrom this deed, I now realize—\nWho will save me from the **wheel of rebirth**?\nI resign my office, return my seal, and abandon worldly glory,\nWith fervor, I seek a path to escape this mortal coil.\"*\n\nThus, he changed his garments and dwelled in humble places,\nTo shame his former form.\n\nHe also wrote a couplet:\n\n*\"I cast aside the **fire dwelling** with its three thousand dependents,\nI banish the **gate guards** of my hundred thousand household.\"*\n\nLater, he wandered far into the **Qín River basin**,\nRefining his **true essence** before **Tàihuá**,\nHiding his traces beneath **Zhōngnán**,\nNurturing his **qi** and purifying his mind—\nUntil he attained **true perfection**.\n\nOne day, in **Dàizhōu**’s **Shòuning Guān**, he splashed ink to form the four characters **\"Cùihè Qíshòu\"** (Tortoise and Crane of Equal Longevity)**,** over a span of more than a **zàng** (yard). He also inscribed his own likeness on the wall, followed by a request.\n\nLater, in **Chéngdū’s Qīngyáng Guān** in **Xīshǔ**, he splashed ink to form the four characters **\"Qīng’ān Fúshòu\"** (Serene Peace and Blessed Longevity)**.**\nIn **Dàizhōu’s Fènghuáng Shān**, at the **Láiyí Guān**, he splashed ink to form the four characters **\"Shòushān Fúhǎi\"** (Longevity Mountain and Auspicious Sea)**.**\nThough these three places were separated by thousands of **lǐ** (miles),\nHe wrote them all on the same day—\nTo display his boundless **divine transformations**.\n\nAfterward, he inscribed a lengthy poem, saying:\n\n*\"Drunkenly riding a white donkey, I came,\nAnd the copper **tail** was dragged in disdain.\nA **green-eyed barbarian** led me along,\nCarrying a **lean bamboo staff** on his shoulder.\nI forgot the affairs of the dusty world,\nMy home now is **Gě Hóng’s well**.\nI do not study the **Huángtíng Jīng**,\nNor do I boil the **Lónghǔ Dǐng**’s elixir.\nStanding alone in the **urban markets**,\nI accept no invitations from the vulgar crowd.\nI wish to take up the **Pīlì Jīn**,\nAnd ascend to **Kūnlún’s peak**.\nI bought **ten horns** from the **Hángniú**,\nAnd plowed **half a field** in the **stream’s domain**.\nPlanting **millet** and brewing **white wine**,\nThat is the **Daoist’s** tranquil scene.\nDrunkenly reclining beneath ancient pines,\nI converse with **white clouds** on the **ridge**.\nIf I wish to depart, I depart immediately,\nVanishing into the **shadow of an autumn hair**’s breadth.\nThough his **manifestations** were many across the **realms of transformation**,\nI recount only his grandest deeds.\n\nThe **eulogy** reads:\n\n*\"How great the difficulty of attaining wealth and nobility!\nHow great the difficulty of abandoning them!\nYet if one can attain and then abandon them,\nThere is none who will not ascend to the **Great Luo** and wander in **Yùjīng**.*\nFrom ancient times to the present,\nI have seen this in **Master Sìu of the Sea Hare** alone.\n\nFrom the **Jìnshì** rank, he rose to **Chancellor of Yàn**,\nWith **golden seals** in hand, his kindness extended to **nine clans**,\nHis **purple girdle** bore his name across the **four quarters**.\nOne day, he met **Zhèngyáng Zǐ**,\nAnd understood the peril of the **gold coin**’s stacking—\nHe sighed at the **Mǎo Angle**’s ultimate danger,\nShattered the **seven treasures** to turn them to dust,\nAnd regarded **ten thousand gold** as filth.\nHe cast aside the **fire dwelling** of three thousand souls,\nAnd banished the **gate guards** of a hundred thousand households.\nHe resigned his office and danced madly on the **market cliffs**,\nReturned his seal and dwelled in the **mountain wilds**.\nRefining his **qi** beneath **Zhōngnán**,\nNurturing his **true essence** before **Tàihuá**—\nThus, he could **tread upon water and fire** without harm,\nPierce **gold and stone** yet face no obstruction.\nHe rode a **purple phoenix**,\nHeld the **Pīlì Jīn** in his hand,\nRode a white donkey in drunken revelry,\nAnd trod upon **Kūnlún’s peak**.\nHe splashed ink to form four characters,\nChanging his form while separated by thousand-mile mountains—\nTruly, the **Dao** does not betray those who see it!\n\nIndeed, the poem says:\n*\"Smashing coral treasures, they do not invite me to feast,\nI return to the **high peaks**, where white clouds drift.\nThe **Buddha’s lute** ascends straight to **Kūnlún’s summit**,\nLaughing at the **fleeting years** of mortal life.\"*\n\n**Master Zhōngfāng of Chóngyáng**\nThe Master’s given name was **Zhōngfāng**, with the courtesy name **Jiǔqīng**.\n\n「His family lineage originated from **Hànyáng** [咸阳], the foremost of the rightful clans [右族], in the region where the **Liú Jiāng** [刘蒋] rivers and bamboo groves mingled with misty peaks and refreshing breezes [水竹烟霞爽恺之地]. There, he established a separate villa, intending it as his final resting place.\n\nAs for his person, he possessed a sturdy and imposing frame [骨木雄壮], a grand and profound **qi** presence [气象浑厚], eyes larger than his mouth, and a beard longer than his belly. His voice rang like a bell [声如钟], and his complexion gleamed like jade [面如玉]. With a **Dao** aura of unceasing freshness [清风飘飘], and a **qi** of vibrant purple radiance [紫气郁郁], he bore the countenance of one dwelling in the vastness of lakes and seas [湖海之相].\n\nHis physical strength surpassed that of ordinary men [膂力倍人], and his talent was unmatched by common folk [才名拔俗]. Early in life, he mastered the **Classics** and histories [蚤通经史], and later trained in archery and swordsmanship [晚习弓刀].\n\nWhen the **Qí Fù** [齐阜] and **Chāng Wèn** [昌问] prefectures were abolished, he presented an ode to the **Spring Officials** [春官], yet was dismissed for not conforming to their expectations. Later, he took the **military examination** [武举], and thus attained the highest rank [甲科].\n\nAt the age of forty-seven, he sighed deeply and said: *\"Confucius was free from doubt at forty, and Mencius remained unmoved in heart at forty. I have surpassed them in years, yet still I devour raw flesh and peck at rotten bones, toil for purple robes and hoard gold—is this not the height of folly?\"* He then resigned from office, broke his official seal [解印], cast aside his wife and children, dusted off his robes and left the worldly affairs behind, resembling the **wandering madman of Chu** [楚狂] in his reckless abandon.\n\nIn the year **Jìmǎo** [己卯] of the **Zhènglóng** [正隆] era, when he was forty-eight, he passed by a butcher’s stall at **Gānhé Bridge** [甘河桥], savoring the marrow and chewing heartily. Suddenly, two **Daoists** [道者], each clad in white felt [白毡], emerged stealthily from the south. Their bearing was as ethereal as mist and clouds [烟霞态度], their spirit as boundless as the heavens and the sea [霄汉精神]. Observing their brows and eyes, they seemed strikingly alike.\n\nThe Master did not notice them at first but was startled to his feet and approached. He bowed his head slightly and greeted them with a forward bow [倪首前揖]. Their speech was entirely beyond the worldly [出世语], and through their words, he shed his dust and purified his stains, removed his ignorance and dispelled his blindness. It was as if he had drunk and suddenly awakened, as if he had been sick and now recovered. They secretly imparted the **authentic Daoist methods** [真诀], and he was renamed **\"Zhù\"** [矗], with the courtesy name **\"Zhīmíng\"** [知明], and styled himself **\"Master Zhòngyáng\"** [重阳子].\n\nAfter their instruction concluded, one of the **Daoists** pointed to the southern direction and asked: *\"Why do you not observe it?\"*\nThe Master turned and looked back, but the **Daoist** said: *\"What do you see?\"*\n\nThe **Daoist** laughed and said: *\"Is it merely this? There will also be ten thousand fragrant jade lotuses blooming!\"*\nHaving spoken, he suddenly vanished.\n\nFrom then on, the Master wandered aimlessly, unconstrained, begging for food in the markets, clad in a patched raincoat and a broken gourd bowl, sleeping beneath the ice and snow outside. He composed a verse:\n\n*\"At forty-eight, I first encountered them,*\n*And when the **authentic Daoist methods** were imparted, my efforts bore fruit.\n*A single grain of **golden elixir** grows ever more refined—*\n*On **Yùjīng** Mountain’s peak, its crimson hue shines bright.*\n\nThe following year, in the **Gēngshēn** [庚辰] cycle, there was a **Daoist** who shared his lodging. Mid-month, the **Daoist** spoke: *\"I dwell in the vast mountains of the west-north. There, someone asked if there were any who excelled in expounding the **Yīnfú** [《阴符》] and **Dàodé** [《道德》]—especially those who were well-versed in them. I heard you have long favored these two **scriptures**, yet why do you not follow me? Come and listen to my teachings.\"*\n\nThe Master hesitated, unable to respond immediately. The **Daoist** suddenly rose, cast aside his staff, and rode the wind away. His attendants searched for him, but there was no trace—only a lingering sense of loss, as if something had been irretrievably gone.\n\n「When the time came to the **Mid-Autumn Festival**, passing through **Líquán** County, the Master encountered the **Daoist** again. He hastened forward and bowed to him. The **Daoist** then invited him into a tavern, where they drank together. During their conversation, the Master inquired about his homeland, and the **Daoist** replied: *\"I reside in **Púzhé Yǒnglè** [蒲圾永乐].\"*\n\nThe Master further asked his age, and the **Daoist** answered: *\"Twenty-two years of spring and autumn.\"*\"\n\nWhen asked about his lineage, the **Daoist** remained silent. The Master then requested a brush and paper to record five secret teachings, which he instructed the Master to read carefully. The Master read them repeatedly before grasping their profound principles, and he solemnly warned: *\"The celestial **Dao/Way** must not be carelessly revealed.\"* He immediately ordered the papers burned in the fire.\n\nThe **Daoist** said: *\"Hurry to **Shùhǎi** [束海], where in the **Qiū Liú Tán** [丘刘谭] region there is a noble steed. You may capture it.\"* Having spoken, he vanished without trace.\n\nThe first of these teachings read:\n*\"Suddenly arriving in **Qín** lands, wandering through **Cháng'ān**, some sell **elixir** in the marketplaces, others hide their traces in the mountains and forests. Following such paths for years, one sees countless **common folk**, all coarse and wicked—mere **lower demons**. Now you meet my disciple, why not abruptly cast aside the **mundane world**, awaken fiercely to its vanity, and relish **dew of the clouds** before the **jade capital’s** splendor? Fit to refine **qi** beneath the **pine peaks**, you may govern **creation** and reverse the **yin-yang**, arraying the **constellations** within the **Nine Cauldrons** and gathering **all transformations** into a single **cauldron**. With a thousand days of merit fulfilled, your name will be inscribed in the **Immortal Registers**; after three years of diligence, you shall eternally pacify the **eons** of **samsara**. Fear that your tardiness may cause your body to sink into the **underworld’s depths**.\"*\n\nThe second teaching read:\n*\"Do not cling to **wine and feasting** in the **mundane world**, nor let yourself be bound by earthly concerns.\nWhen **Dragon** and **Tiger** stir, snowflakes scatter like waves;\nwhere the water’s voice is clear, the **profane dust** dissolves.\nSince my awakening on the **path**, my words have strayed but still hold meaning.\nOne day, when the **Nine Refined Elixir** is complete,\nI shall depart with my companions to **Pénglái**.\"*\n\nThe third teaching read:\n*\"The **Qiao Dragon** is refined in the **Fire Beacon Pavilion**,\nthe **Meng Tiger** captured to ensnare the **Water Spirit**.\nDo not force the **Dao/Way** nor debate its principles—\nsuch **errant talk** only complicates matters.\"*\n\nThe fourth teaching read:\n*\"Lead is the **medicine of mercury**,\nmercury the **essence of lead**—\nknowing lead and mercury,\n**nature abides** and **life is suspended**.\"*\n\nThe fifth teaching read:\n*\"When the **Nine Refined Elixir** is perfected,\nenter **Nánjīng**,\nfind a **true friend**,\nand proceed to **Péngléng**.\"*\n\nThe Master then returned to **Qiū Liú** [丘刘], constructing a small hermitage for himself. He inscribed upon its lintel: *\"The Tomb of the Living Dead\"* [活死人墓], and erected a paper plaque above it reading: *\"The Position of King Harm-Wind’s Spirit\"* [王害风灵位]. He composed a poem:\n\n*\"The Living Dead, King Harm-Wind’s fate,\nWater and clouds—another kind of harmony.\nThe **Daoist name** calls me **Chóngyáng** [重阳] Master,\nMy **maddened cry** is called ‘No-Ground-Buried.’*\n*The **path** of those who come,\nI shall not forget—\nTraveling, they must hang the **Spirit Plaque**.*\n\nOne day, he carried a single **gourd of wine** and stood by the roadside. A **Daoist** called out: *\"Harm-Wind! Harm-Wind! Bring me your wine!\"* The Master responded in kind, offering him a drink until the **gourd was empty**. The **Daoist** then sent the Master with the **empty gourd** to the **Sweet River** [甘河] to fetch water, commanding him to drink it himself. The water tasted exquisite—truly the **elixir of the Immortals**. The **Daoist** revealed himself: *\"I am **Hǎi Chán** [海蟾], the **Master of the Sea**.\"* Having spoken, he vanished once more.\n\nFrom that time onward, the Master no longer drank **wine**, but only **water**. He often appeared intoxicated, and thus he recounted the *\"Fisherman’s Song\"* [《虞美人》]:\n\n*\"Harm-Wind drinks water—how much does he know?\nThis way, the **mysteries** become clear.\nIn a **white hemp** robe, with a **green silk** headband,\nHis bearing is refined—truly a **spirited** man.\nNo need for mirrors to reflect his form,\nFor all things are revealed in his heart.\nHe discerns the **body in dreams** as the **dream itself**,\nA true **free and easy wanderer** who has crossed to the **other shore**.\nOne day, he suddenly burned his hermitage.\nNeighbors rushed to save the flames, but the Master only swayed and danced.\nWhen asked the reason, he replied: ‘In three years, another will take up the **practice**.’\nHe inscribed a poem:\n\n*'The thatched hut burns—no need for further action,\nFor another will soon come to **cultivate**.*\n*To be **awakened** is to be **fierce**,\nHow can one learn my **effortless grace**?*\n\nIn the **seventh year of the Dàdìng** [大定] era, on the **twenty-sixth day of the fourth month**, he leisurely wandered toward **Shùhǎi**, passing through **Xiányáng**. There, he sketched a portrait of himself as a **three-crowned Daoist**, with **lush green pines** sheltering him, **white clouds** swirling about, and a **crane** dancing in **transcendent elegance**. Upon meeting **Shǐ Fēngxiān** [史风仙], he joyfully gave him the sketch, saying: *\"Wait until I capture the **steed** and present it to you as a **companion**.\"*\n\nHe then traveled to **Luòyáng**, where he visited the **Upper Clarity Palace** [上清宫] and inscribed a poem on its wall:\n\n*\"Qiū, Liú, and Tán’s King Harm-Wind captures the **steed**,\nOn **Kūnlún’s** peak, he strikes the **jade ball**.\nYou still linger within the **cyclic world**,\nGaining **three thousand eight hundred measures** of merit.\nAt **Shùhǎi** in **Wèizhōu**, I met **Xiāo Zhēnrén** [萧真人],\nWho bore **Daoist** mien and **spirit of the Way**—\nI longed to guide him, lingering for days.\nYet our words did not align, so I gave him the *\"Mùshān Stream\"* [蓦山溪]:\n\n*'The **True Person** has already awakened,\nHis fame reaches the **four seas** first.*\n*Only because he has heard the **teachings**,\nHe remains distant from the **Supreme Primordial’s** **mystic Dao/Way**.*\n*Alas, his **Immortal essence**,\nFalls into a **demonic mortal form**—\nEqually **decayed**, equally **aged**,\nAll striving toward the same end.*\n*He does not know the **mysteries**,\nNor does he scorn **body and mind**.*\n*Like the **deaf and blind**, he passes days,*\n*Mocked for not recognizing the **elixir furnace** and **tortoise**.*\n*He takes these two things,\nRefines them in the **cauldron**,\nAnd when the **elixir** is consumed,\nHe gains **longevity**, returning to **Péngdǎo** with his hands clasped.*\n\nThe **True Person** read it but could not fathom its **profound meaning**—he only nodded in acknowledgment.\n\nThe **Master** then continued toward **Shùhǎi**, wandering along its shores for years, **drawing and transforming** disciples. He gathered **Qiū, Liú, Tán, Mǎ, Hǎo, Sūn, and Wáng**—seven in total—thus completing the **number of the Seven Golden Lotuses**. He universally transformed **three states**, leading them to **five assemblies**:\n1. **Equality** [平等],\n2. **Golden Lotus** [金莲],\n3. **Jade Flower** [玉华],\n4. **Three Lights** [三光],\n5. **Seven Treasures** [七宝].\n\nThe inscription on its lintel read:\n*\"I consider **Equality** the **root of Dao/Virtue and Power** [道德],\nthe **source of purity and struggle** [清挣],\nthe **foundation of the Golden Lotus and Jade Flower**,\nand the **core of the Three Lights and Seven Treasures**.\nIt universally benefits all **living beings**,\nand universally liberates the **common folk**.\nIts **silver flames** fill the **eight extremes**,\nand its **rainbow mists** rise to the **ten directions**.\nAll wish to **spit forth** at the **Yellow Sprout** [黄芽],\nNone linger in the **Black Path** [黑路].\"*\n\n**The Jade Flower** is the **root of qi**, the **Golden Lotus** is the **ancestor of spirit** [神]. When qi and spirit **intertwine** [相结], it is called **Divine Immortal**.\n\nOne day, he would lead **Hill, Liu, Tan, Ma** southward to **Kaifeng**. **Jar King** [瓮王] lingered in an inn for over a year, receiving much instruction. He then inscribed a verse on a bamboo staff to show them:\n\n*\"One staff named **No-Adherence** [无着],\nEach node gleaming, its light blazing—\nMagnificent! The **void-heart** [虚心] stands straight and firm,\nIts wrapped head brimming with **elixir** [灵丹药].\nUnshaken, unmoved, it rests in **tranquility** [清闲],\nYet responds to all things with **adaptive skill** [随机能做作].\nIt seeks **true companions** [知友] across the seas,\nWho can bear to be its **leaning support** [依托]?\n\nLast night, in a dream, I saw **all the rainbows** [诸虹],\nWithin them, four could leap and dance.\nWith a staff’s **guidance** [引],\nA step’s **shift** [移],\nA **silver thread** [银丝索] burst from the **crown** [顶中],\nPiercing brows, revealing eyes—**spirit** [神] invigorated!\nA **soul-pearl** [灵珠] gleamed forth, its light dazzling,\nBright flames ascended, all in **harmonious joy** [乐然],\nWhite clouds did not betray the **radiant red mist** [红霞灼].\nWhen the verse was finished, he said:\n\n*\"Long ago, the **Hairy Robe Master** [披毡师] revealed secret teachings:\n**Nine transformations** [九转] complete,\nTo **Southern Capital** [南京] I enter,\nFind **true companions** [知友],\nAnd journey to **Penglai** [蓬瀛].\nI now fulfill this promise.\n\nHis disciples were **alarmed** [惶恐], begging for words to leave behind. The Master said:\n*\"I inscribed them on the wall three years ago.\n**Earth’s Lungs** [地肺] holds **Zhongyangzi** [重阳子],\n**Strongly summon** [强呼] **Jar King** [王害风] to **wind’s aid** [风],\nCome with the sun and moon,\nDepart with the **setting west** [西束].\n**Companions** [伴] are **Cloud and Water** [云和],\n**Neighbors** [邻] are **Void and Emptiness** [虚与空].\nOne **soul’s true nature** [灵真性] remains,\nNot shared with the common folk.\n\nAgain, he said:\n**Jar King’s wind affliction** [害风] resurfaces,\nHis lifespan shall not exceed **fifty-eight** [五十八].\nTwo **Masters** [先生] will come next,\nOne **soul’s true nature** [灵真性] will be **searched and refined** [搜刷].\n\nTo the disciples, he said:\n*\"After my return, take care not to **lament** [举哀].\nWhen he had finished speaking, he **shed his mortal form** [委蜕].\n\n**Danyang** [丹阳] could not help but weep, deeply grieved. The crowd urged him:\n*\"Do not defy the **Immortal Teacher’s** [仙师] words.\n**Danyang** said:\n*\"My **entry into the Dao** [入道] is but meager,\nYet my Teacher abandons me—**how can I return** [遑遑何归]?\nHis plea unfinished, he suddenly opened his eyes and said:\n*\"Why do you **resent** [憾恨] so?\nLong ago, the **five secret teachings** [秘语] from **Ganhe River** [甘河],\nI now entrust to you.\n**Danyang** bowed twice, knelt, and received them.\n\nThen to **Tan Gong** [谭公], he said:\n*\"Your lives are in **Danyang’s** hands.\nHe then addressed his **external kin** [物外亲眷]:\n*\"One nephew, two sons, and one **Mountain of Sorrow** [山恫],\nTogether with me—**five hearts of one accord** [一心雄].\nSix **illumined ones** [六明] accompany the **edge-of-sky moon** [天边月],\nSeven **refined spirits** [七爽] invite the **seaside breeze** [海上风].\n**True Marvelous Elixir** [真妙] wraps the head,\n**Hidden Perfection** [密妙] is plucked within.\nAbove the **void of vision** [睛空],\nHe treads the **emptiness of space** [虚空].\n**West, south, north** [西南北] all **circle and turn** [圆转],\nOnly here does one know **all paths are open** [处处通].\nAgain, he said:\n*\"One brother, one nephew—two sons,\nTogether with me—**five refined ones** [五逸] in cultivation.\nBound as **true kin beyond the world** [物外真亲眷],\nCast off the **false union of mortal flesh** [人问假合尸].\n**All-encompassing** [周匝], they **nurture** [种] the **realm of pure disputation** [清诤境],\n**Passing down** [递相传授] the **Purple Elixir Branch** [紫灵枝].\nAt the **mountain’s summit** [山头], they **enter and exit** [进出] the **Assembly of Soul-Bloom** [灵华会],\nI **attend** [趁] **Penglai** first to **pay respects** [礼师].\n\nWhen the poem was done, he **quietly returned to his true nature** [奄然返真],\nWith **mystic fragrance** [异香] lingering thick,\n**Auspicious qi** [瑞气] filling the air,\nA **white crane** [白鹤] soared in the sky,\nA **green mandarin duck** [青鸾] swept the earth,\nHis **Immortal bearing** [仙仪] ascended beyond the clouds.\n\n**Scholars and commoners, officials and common folk** [士庶官寮] all **gazed and worshipped** [号呼瞻拜],\nAs if mourning a **deceased parent** [丧考妣],\nNone failed to **praise and marvel** [赞叹],\nA **true marvel of the ages** [真千古异事].\n\nThen, they prepared **funeral coffins and shrouds** [棺椁衣袅],\nBuried him with **rites** [礼],\nOn the **fourth day of the first month, Regency Era of Gengyin** [大定庚寅正月初四].\n\nAfter his **ascension** [升遐], beneath **Junyu Bridge** [浚仪桥], **Tan Gong** [谭] **discussed mysteries** [谈玄], **Zang Lao** [臧老]’s heart was **lured** [诱].\nBeside **Liujiang Creek** [刘蒋溪], he **bestowed elixir** [赐药], curing **Master Zhang’s** [张公] affliction.\nSome **danced** [舞蹈] at the **right of Kunming Lake** [昆明池右],\nSome **recited verses** [吟咏] in **Zhongnan Domain** [终南境中],\nAll displaying signs of **immortality** [不死].\n\n**Hill, Liu, Tan, and Ma** [丘、刘、谭、马] four disciples **clasped hands** [相拥], traveling west into **Chang’an** [长安],\nWhere they met **Master Shifeng** [史风先生],\nPresented him with a **Pine-Crane Diagram** [松鹤图].\n**Shifeng** laughed and said:\n*\"At that time, I left behind **No-Adherence** [勘同],\nExactly matching this diagram.\nWhen compared, not a **hair’s breadth** [毫发] differs.\nThus, they **traversed Zhongnan** [历终南],\n**Visited Liujiang** [访刘蒋],\nAnd **dwelled in the Ancestral Hall** [住持祖庵].\"\n\nThe **tomb’s adornments** were nearly complete, yet they **returned to Liang Garden** [梁园],\nTogether **transplanting the immortal remains** [移仙骨], opening the coffin to inspect—\n**Form and spirit** [形神] still bore traces of life.\n\nThe four disciples **conferred in turn**, bearing him westward.\nWherever their journey led, they would **settle the lodging fees** [酬馆谷之资],\nYet the innkeepers would always say:\n*\"A Daoist of old has already paid.\"*\n\nThey **strived to pursue** him, yet could never catch sight.\nWhen asked of his appearance, it was revealed as the **Ancestral Master’s** [祖师] **manifestation** [化身].\n\nUpon arriving at **Zhongnan**, they **divined the site** [卜地] and buried him there.\n\n**Initially**, when **Master Wang** [望仙] toured **Dengzhou** [登州],\nOutside the gate, he saw the **painted bridge** [画桥] was dangerously steep,\nSo he spoke:\n*\"This bridge—when the day comes, it must be destroyed.\"*\n\nNone understood his meaning.\nAfter a decade, **Magistrate He** [何公], disliking its extreme peril,\nOrdered its **facade demolished** [毁其脸] and leveled the path—\nThus it became known as **Encountering the Immortal Bridge** [遇仙桥].\n\nLater, in **Wendeng County** [文登县], a **ritual exorcism** [作醮] was held amid **Five-Colored Clouds** [五色云中],\nWhere a **great white tortoise** [白龟] appeared, bearing a **lotus** [莲花].\nThe Ancestral Master **sat upright** [端坐] upon the **lotus flower** [莲药],\nThen **turned aside** [侧外] and returned.\n\nThe county magistrate, **Lady Ni** [尼厉窟], witnessed this herself,\nOffered incense in reverence, and commissioned an artist to **copy his true likeness** [对写真容].\nAll across the three prefectures, people gazed in awe.\n\nFrom **Danyang** [丹阳], one composed the *\"Manting Huang\"* [《满庭芳》] in praise:\n*\"Ancient Dengzhou, at the gate of Encountering the Immortal,\nWhere the painted bridge blocks all carriages.\nOn the Double Ninth, sacred traces appear—\nBefore the crowd, the family’s virtue shines.\nHe foretold its ruin when the time came,\nA decade passed, Magistrate He found its iron treachery unbearable,\nOrdered its destruction, and craftsmen rebuilt it anew.\nAgain in Wendeng, he manifested—\nUpon a white tortoise, lotus-borne, seated in the void.\nThe magistrate’s green-robed reverence—\nBeholding his true form.\nSuddenly, he turned and reclined,\nAs auspicious clouds stirred, returning to the Celestial Palace.\nClearly seen, his portrait far surpasses—\nWherever one does not revere him.\nTruly, he was one who died yet did not perish,\nWorthy of being the **Ancestor of the Seven Immortals** [七真之祖].\"*\n\nAll his **divine transformations** [神变] were boundless, too numerous to record.\nHe **persuaded the Daoist and secular** [劝化道俗] across the **Western Seas and Qin** [束海西秦],\nComposing **long and short verses** [长歌短咏] numbering nearly a thousand—\nCollectively titled *\"The Complete True Before-and-After\"* [《全真前后集》] and *\"Cloud-Mid Records\"* [《云中录》],\nIlluminating the **lead-mercury-metalwood-fire** [铅汞坎离] doctrines,\nWhich flourished in the world.\n\nHe also **responded in verse to Dengzhou’s Daoist assembly** [登州道众书诗] and **nineteen-branch diagrams** [十九枝图].\n\n「玉蟾和真人」:\n\n**In Praise of the Precious Toad’s True Person** [玉蟾子]:\nThe seasons revolve, yet he retains the youthful vigor of eternal spring;\nThe Three Teachings [三教] stand distinct, yet he liberates one from life’s sorrows.\nAll who cultivate **Dao** [道] in thought and deed—\nWith a single awakening, they perfect their refinement.\nIn nine transformations, he points to the Way’s fulfillment,\nAscending to the Eight Gates of Immortality [登仙八门],\nTaking **Long Spring** [长春] as his eternal companion.\nDaring to seek the subtlest mysteries,\nHe further entreats to enter the **Play of the Mysterious** [投玄],\nAnd thus becomes my humble chapter,\nRecorded in the scroll’s final pages.\n\n**His Verse** [诗]:\n*\"All know that constancy [常] dwells beside the Dao,\nSeeking the **supreme mysteries** [玄玄], they forge a kinship.\nDo not forget the Three Teachings’ wisdom,\nThe **Complete True** [全真] takes the eternal spring of the Four Seasons [四时] as its own.\nNurture the **Original Qi** [元气] to fullness,\nForming the **Refined Spirit** [灵神] at the **Leakless Spring** [没漏津].\nMay the Nineteen Radiant Branches [十九光明] fulfill my wish—\nI dare invite you to share in the **True Person’s Joy** [乐天真].\"*\n\n**His Eulogy** [赞]:\nThe **Ancestor** [祖师] emerged in the world,\nEncountering four **True Ones** [真仙] in his lifetime.\nHe drank from the **Sweet River** [甘河]’s single essence,\nAnd was granted the **Five Secret Scriptures** [秘辞] of the **Five Thunders** [五篇].\nThe Nineteen Leaves [十九叶] passed down from the **Cinnamon Tree** [桂树],\nA **million branches** [一万枝] unbroken from the **Golden Lotus** [金莲].\n\nHe raised the **Treasure Mirror** [宝镜] high,\nIlluminating the **scenes within the Tripod Cauldron** [壶中之景];\nThe **Divine Pearl** [神珠] shone alone,\nRevealing the **karmic ties beyond the Sages’ Calamities** [劫外之缘].\nWho could know the **ancient Daoist lineage’s customs** [太古家风]?\nThey passed through sleeves and robes in secret,\nYet envied the **Name of Jade Sun** [玉阳名字],\nTransmitted stealthily beneath a **bamboo parasol** [伞竹].\n\nHe cast his **hook of fate** [钧竿] into the **Great Void** [默然之海],\nA **Great Sage** [大士] in silent retreat,\nLater returning to his **boat of leisure** [船舫],\nA **wandering recluse** [散人] in the **Pure Stillness** [清静之渊].\n\nHe became the **guide of the Great Dao** [大教权舆之主],\nThe **forerunner of the Complete True** [全真户牖之先].\nWhen his merit was fulfilled and fame secured,\nHe then rode the **Lingering Crane and Tortoise** [跨鸾鹤],\nAscending to the **Azure Sky** [青天].\n\n**Zhang the Divine Child’s Verse** [张神童诗]:\n*\"He foresaw the **Lingering Heaven of Mount Zhongnan** [终南一洞天],\nOnce leading the **Western Seas and Qin** [束海] to gather the **True Ones** [诸仙].\nWith a **single stroke of transcendent insight** [入圣超几手],\nHe cultivated the **Seven Golden Lotus Blossoms** [黄金七朵莲].\"\n\n---\n\nThe **Precious Toad** [玉蟾] harmonized with the **True Person** [真人].\nHis given name was **De Jin** [德瑾],\nA native of **Ganquan, Qinzhou** [秦州甘泉].\n\nHis talents soared beyond measure,\nHis vision vast and his spirit refined—\nHis **Daoist essence** [玄资] mirrored in the clouds,\nHis **wondrous nature** [妙质] suspended in mist.\nIn his prime, he excelled in **calligraphy and literature** [翰墨].\n\nAt first, he concealed himself among **litigants and scribes** [刀笔吏],\nYet his heart remained pure and detached,\nTreating the **Dao** [道] as his core,\nNever taking unjust wealth.\nHe visited all **recluses and wandering guests** [幽人逸客],\nNone who did not seek his counsel.\n\nOne day, at leisure, he met a **Daoist wanderer** [道者],\nWho shared wine and discussed the **mysteries** [玄].\nThey conversed till dawn,\nAnd were sworn as **kindred souls** [莫逆之交].\n\nLater, the Daoist raised an **owl** [枭] on his arm,\nEntering from afar and saying to **Precious Toad** [和公]:\n*\"This bird is strange indeed—\nIts eyes so vast, yet it cannot recognize a man.*\n**Precious Toad** [公] did not comprehend,\nOnly nodding in polite response.\n\nAfter a month, unexpectedly,\nThe Daoist fell gravely ill,\nNo physician could cure him.\nIn days, he passed away,\nAnd **Precious Toad** [和公] prepared his coffin and buried him.\n\nYet within a few decades,\nAn aged woman knocked at his door, saying:\n*\"Long ago, a Daoist died here—\nHe was my true son.\nAlas, I am old now,\nMy body drifts alone,\nWith no refuge or sustenance,\nNo means to clothe or feed myself—\nWhere shall I turn?\"*\n\n**Precious Toad** [和公] pitied her,\nGiving her gold and silk.\nThe woman replied:\n*\"I wish to open his grave and coffin,\nTo gaze upon his face once more—\nThen my life will have no regrets.*\nThough he entreated repeatedly,\n**Precious Toad** [和公] could not refuse.\n\nWhen the coffin was opened,\nNo corpse was found—\nOnly the gold and silk he had given.\nThe woman was sought again,\nBut she had vanished.\n\n**Precious Toad** [和公] sighed:\n*\"Such **divine transformations** [神通变化] are wondrous beyond measure—\nCould any but an **Immortal Sage** [仙圣] achieve this?\"*\n\nFrom that moment, he was moved,\nAbandoning worldly attachments,\nRetiring to the forest,\nRefining his **inner alchemy** [修炼] with utmost devotion,\nUniting **Dao** [道] and **Truth** [真].\n\nHearing that the **Zhongnan Chongyang Ancestor** [终南重阳祖师]\nMastered the **Nine Regressions’ Refining** [九还锻炼之术],\nHe journeyed to study with him,\nResiding in the **Ancestral Hall** [祖庭],\nHis **Daoist insights** [玄妙] deepening daily,\nHis **qi** [气] growing **pure and harmonious** [冲和],\nHis **heart-mind** [心地] opening to clarity,\nGaining **foresight** [先见之明].\n\nAnticipating the arrival of **Qiu, Liu, Tan, and Ma** [丘、刘、谭、马],\nHe went with **Master Li, Lingyangzi** [李公灵阳子] to a **bakery** [饼店],\nLeaving four **copper coins** [分] for **soup** [羹],\nAnd instructing the vendor:\n*\"Today, four **Daoist guests** [道者] will arrive—\nKnown as Qiu, Liu, Tan, and Ma.\nUse these to await them.\"*\n\nAfter speaking, he returned home.\nSoon, four Daoists arrived.\nThe vendor asked:\n*\"Are you not Qiu, Liu, Tan, and Ma?\"*\nThe four exchanged glances and laughed:\n*\"How do you know?\"*\nThe vendor replied:\n*\"**Precious Toad** [和] and **Master Li** [李] have left coins here for your meal.\"*\nThe four sighed in awe:\n*\"Truly a **True Person** [异人].\"*\n\nAfter eating, they went to meet him,\nTheir joy surpassing even old acquaintances.\n\nBefore his **ascension** [升遐] three years prior,\nHe commissioned an artist to paint his **true form** [真相],\nAnd entrusted it to **Tiger Head** [虎头].\nThen, he fell into a deep slumber,\nNone understanding his intent.\n\nOn the **19th day of the 2nd month, in the year of the Tiger** [大定庚寅岁二月十有九日],\nHe summoned **Master Ma, the Virtue-Keeper** [功德主]:\n*\"I owe you boundless gratitude,\nYet have nothing to repay.\nShould you face great **calamity** [患难],\nSimply burn incense and recite my name in secret—\nI will come to save you.\"*\n\nThat day, the sky was clear and bright,\nWith **misty hues** [霞彩] glowing in reflection.\nThe **neighbors to the west** [束邻西舍] all smelled an **unusual fragrance** [异香].\nThen, in his **grass hut** [草堂],\nHe rested on his arm,\nSilently departing from the world and returning to the **Dao** [真].\n\nThus, he foretold his ascension in the year of the Tiger [庚寅].\nAfter his **departure** [升遐], **Zhang the Elder of Linqiu** [临潼张叟]\nSuffered long from **hernia** [疝疾],\nNo physician able to help,\nHis fate nearly sealed.\n\nOne night, in a dream,\nHe encountered **Precious Toad** [先生],\nWho detailed the **medicinal formulas** [药饵] for his cure.\nAsked of his name,\nIt was **Precious Toad** [和公].\nUpon waking, he followed the instructions,\nAnd his illness vanished instantly—\nProof that **Precious Toad’s spirit** [先生之神] lingers near,\nAnd that **immortality** [不死] dwells among the **True Ones** [真].\"\n\n**His Eulogy** [赞]:\n*\"Great is the difficulty of transforming mortals,\nGreat is the difficulty of clarifying the Dao—\nEven the **Precious Toad** [玉蟾子], who so longed for **Master Qi** [希夷],\nWho so indulged in the **mysteries** [玄妙],\nCould not awaken them.\nThe Daoists came to his door and formed bonds, yet he did not understand.\nThey employed every means to lure him, yet he did not understand.\nThey warned him with the **owl’s blind eyes** [臬目], yet he did not understand.\nThey struck him with **grave illness** [恶疾], yet he did not understand.\nThey revealed themselves through **corpse dissolution** [尸解], yet he did not understand.\nThey sent the **aged woman** [老妪] to visit him, yet he did not understand.\"*\n\n「When the coffin was opened and no mortal remains were found,\nAnd the aged woman was also lost—\nThen did he know the **sages’** [圣贤] **numen** [感应] was profound,\nAnd suddenly awoke from his **illusion** [酒然] to **enlightenment** [醒].\n\nHe abandoned his wife and children to return to seclusion in the forests and springs,\nDonning the **circlet and cap** [簪冠] to diligently study **nature and life** [性命],\nAnd bowing to **Master Zhongyang** [重阳] to master his **finger-pointed secrets** [指诀].\nThrough the **Nine Transformations** [九转], he perfected his **refinement** [锻炼].\n\n**Beforehand**, he knew the **Four Guests** [四客] would come,\nUnderstood the **direct teaching of leaving a cake** [留饼直],\nAnd foretold the **three-year image** [三年之像].\nHe firmly set his **return date** [归期]—\nA feat none could match.\n\nUltimately, he rode the **void** [空],\nWalked the **empty** [虚],\nAnd transcended his **corporeal form** [神] to enter **dreams** [梦].\nTruly, the **Dao/Way** does not abandon its people.\n\nIndeed,\n**Master Zhongyang** [重阳] revealed the **elixir secret** [还丹诀],\nThe aged woman opened the **karmic bonds of past lives** [宿世缘],\nAnd he laughed as he returned to the **Tiger’s Head** [虎头],\nTo meet in **windswept elegance** [风流] at the **Jade Lotus** [紫金莲].\n\n**Master Lingyang** [灵阳] **Li** [李]—\nHis name has been forgotten,\nBut his **Dao-name** [道号] was **Lingyangzi** [灵阳子],\nA native of **Jingzhao** [京兆] **Zhongnan** [终南].\n\nSilent and few in words, yet his **intelligence** [聪敏] surpassed the world,\nHis **learning** [学问] vast and his **insight** [识量] profound.\nHe cherished **virtue/power** [道德] and rejected worldly fame [利名绝念],\nClearly due to his **karmic affinity** [宿契] with **Master Zhongyang** [重阳],\nWho privately disclosed the **authentic Dao/Way** [真风],\nInstantly dissolving his **ordinary thoughts** [俗念],\nAnd overturning his **attachment to separation** [离颠].\nHe **refined** [磨] by day and **forged** [炼] by night.\n\nOften he gathered with **Master Yushenzi** [玉蟾子] **He** [和] **Gong** [公],\nBound by **karmic ties** [因绿],\nLoving others and aiding beings,\nSacrificing himself for the benefit of others,\nAmassing **meritorious deeds** [阴功],\nAnd crafting **secrets of the talismans** [密符].\n\n**Master Zhongyang** [重阳] composed a verse:\n*\"Pass to He Gong and Li Gong,\nFirst unite in purpose—three minds as one.\"*\n\nWhen the **year of Dading** [大定] **Wushen** [戊申] arrived in the second month of spring,\nThe **Emperor Shizong** [世宗] dispatched envoys to summon **Master Changchunzi** [长春子] **Qiu Gong** [丘公] to the capital.\nAt their parting, **Master Changchun** [长春] said to **Lingyangzi** [灵阳子]:\n*\"The karmic ties of Liu and He,\nEstablished by the **Patriarchs** [祖师],\nMust not be disregarded—\nGuard them well and uphold them.\"*\n\n**Lingyangzi** [灵阳子] replied:\n*\"Next year’s spring breeze will call back the **crane carriage** [鹤驭],\nAnd the mountains and wilds will await my **return** [及期] as the **master of the funeral** [专待主丧].\nNone understood his meaning.\"\n\nBy the time of the following year, **Jiyou** [己酉], in the second month,\n**Lingyangzi** [灵阳子] was unharmed,\nAnd he himself observed **pure abstinence** [清斋].\nHis disciples urged him:\n*\"Our teacher’s body has always been frail,\nAnd now with no grains—\nHow will he endure?\"*\n\n**Lingyangzi** [灵阳子] said:\n*\"Do not doubt—\nI await only the **master of the funeral** [丧主].\"*\n\nAt that time,\n**Master Changchunzi** [长春子] received imperial favor and returned to his native mountain,\nPassing through **Qindugu** [秦渡镇] but lingering without proceeding.\n**Lingyangzi** [灵阳子] sent his disciples to invite him,\nAnd **Master Changchun** [长春] hastened there.\nUpon arriving at the **hermitage** [庵中],\n**Lingyangzi** [灵阳子] joyfully transformed into a **yellow butterfly** [周蝶], fluttering away [栩栩而归].\nAuspicious clouds swept the earth,\n**Fortunate qi** [瑞气] condensed in the sky,\n**Green cranes** [青鸾] lingered gracefully,\nAnd **white cranes** [白鹤] soared—\nAll ranks, from officials to commoners, marveled and sighed in awe.\n\nThus, **Master Changchunzi** [长春子] led his disciples in preparing his **coffin and tomb** [棺椁],\nAnd seated him in repose,\nOn the first day of the third month of **Jiyou** [己酉].\n\n**His Eulogy** [赞] reads:\n*\"The Dao/Way of the world is unparalleled,\nAnd the sages’ hearts are undivided.\nThus, **Wang Gong** [王公], **He Gong** [和公], and **Li Gong** [李公]\nShared the **secret teachings** [秘诀],\nUnited in refining the **elixir** [还砂],\nAnd in **Zhongnan** [终南], the **alchemical cassia** [丹桂] bloomed together,\nWhile upon the **seas** [海上], the **Jade Lotus** [金莲] flourished as one.\n\nHence, the **Full Perfection School** [全真门] reveres them as its **Three Patriarchs** [三祖],\nAnd worships them accordingly—\nHow could they be otherwise?\n\nThe verse says:\n*\"With both hands, he holds the **sun and moon wheels** [日月轮],\nTheir radiance piercing through the **newly transformed world** [万华新].\nAt parting, he did not lightly entrust them,\nWaiting until **Master Changchunzi** [长春] became the **master of the funeral** [主人].\"*\n\n**The Golden Lotus Canon** [金莲正宗记] concludes its second scroll.\n**Master Danyang** [丹阳] **Ma** [马].\n\n「Master Ma of Ninghai, whose courtesy name was **Danyangzi** [丹阳子].\nHis grandfather was surnamed **Jue** [觉], with the courtesy name **Huaxiou** [华叟], well-versed in the **Five Classics** [五经], a man of **virtue** [德] and **trustworthiness** [信义], never breaking a word once spoken. He once traded silk in neighboring regions, resting at an inn in the evening, and saw a poor widow weeping alone in a secluded corner. When asked, she was said to be a **chaste woman** [贞妇], whose husband had died young, who had sworn never to remarry and instead cared for her aged parents-in-law. Alas, they both passed away, leaving her without means to bury them; she was about to sell herself to pay for the **coffin and burial chamber** [棺椁] expenses.\n\nThe Master, with a stern expression, said: *\"Even when neighbors are sick, I assist them; when there is a death in the village, I do not fail to help with provisions—this is not the conduct of a **virtuous** [德] and **righteous** [义] man.\"* He then gave her two bundles of silk and left without inquiring her surname, hurrying to the inn ahead of her. That very night, his belongings were robbed by bandits, yet he said nothing to anyone, calmly returning home. His wife asked about it, and he feigned it was a loan.\n\nHalf a year later, the thieves quarrelled over their divided spoils, revealing the Master’s stolen goods. The Master remarked: *\"The stolen items have been passed around and resold, involving many in legal trouble—this is not a single crime. I’ve endured countless investigations, and the stolen goods amount to over a hundred bolts of silk. If I had reported it, I would have faced the severest punishment. This is not the act of one who does good.\"* He then gave the man two taels of silver to appease his anger, and the thief departed in gratitude.\n\nDuring a famine, the Master spread grain to dry in the courtyard, and a neighbor stole some. When the Master saw her, he concealed himself and let her take what she would, allowing her to leave without hindrance. His father, surnamed **Shiyang** [师扬], with the courtesy name **Xixian** [希贤], was tall and handsome, composed and measured in his bearing. He had five sons, each named after the **Five Constants** [仁义礼智信], collectively called **Wuchang** [五常]. The **Ma family** [马氏] was wealthy, earning the nickname **Mabanzhou** [马半州]. Three of his younger brothers all passed the **imperial examination** [进士], so he built a hall called **Yucheng Tang** [余庆堂], later renamed **Jiangxian Fang** [降仙坊].\n\nBy the year **Xinhai** [辛亥], famine had reached its peak. On a clear morning in the eighth month, a guest frantically tossed a **golden ingot** [细复] onto the table before rushing out without a word. The Master intended to return it by placing it in a cloth bag, but when he lifted it, its radiance was blinding. He weighed it with a balance scale, and it weighed two **jin** [镒]. Ten days later, the guest returned and the Master gave it to him. The guest thanked him, saying: *\"I am **Master Lü Xian** [吕仙], from the village of **Yougu** [幽谷]. I gather herbs for a living. I obtained this two-jin golden ingot to sell in the market, but the tax collector drove me away, nearly bringing me to ruin. Thanks to you, I was spared. I wish to repay you by splitting the gold.\"* The Master declined, saying: *\"This gold came unexpectedly; accepting it might invite misfortune.\"* Lü Xian insisted, and the Master refused again.\n\nLü Xian said: *\"You possess the **auspicious features of the Yellow Emperor** [黄向之风], and in time, your descendants will rise as **Daoist immortals** [神仙].*\" Thereafter, the Master often visited the **Yougu villagers** [幽谷人] and asked after Lü Xian. When told that no Lü family existed there, he suspected the man was indeed a **Daoist adept** [神人].\n\nThe Master’s mother had jade ornaments stolen by a maidservant, but when others urged him to press charges, he took no action. Thus, his wealth only grew, and he lived to the age of sixty-four. He was the second son of his family.\n\nHis son was surnamed **Congyi** [从义], with the courtesy name **Yipu** [宜甫], born on the twentieth day of the fifth month in the year **Guimao** [癸卯]. His mother, **Madame Tang** [唐氏], dreamed she was visited by **Magu** [麻姑], who gave her a **pill of elixir** [丹], which she swallowed. Its glow lingered for seven days before fading, and she clutched her fists tightly for a hundred days before relaxing them. As a child, he often recited phrases of **riding the clouds and astride a crane** [乘云驾鹤], and in dreams, he frequently accompanied Daoists in ascending to heaven.\n\nWith **forty-some dependents** [良贱四十余口], he would gather leftover food from their meals, licking the remaining grains, and wear his old clothes. Once, the Daoist **Master Li Wumeng** [李无梦] refined the **Great Elixir** [大丹] in **Kunjian** [昆箭], but after three years, it remained unfinished. He said: *\"The elixir will only complete when **Daoist immortals** [神仙] descend.\"* One day, the Master played with a group of **bold and virtuous men** [豪杰] near the furnace, and the elixir suddenly transformed. Li Wumeng saw this and marveled, saying to the Master: *\"Your forehead bears the **Three Mountains** [三山], and your hands extend past your knees—you are truly the material of a **Great Immortal** [大仙].\"* He then composed a verse in praise:\n\n*\"A stately figure, round face and long ears,\nRefined brows and bright eyes, straight nose and square mouth.\nAll features complete, a divine radiance crowns your brow—\n**Yipu**, you are marked by the **Way** [道].\"*\n\nThe Master, **Yipu**, received this praise and walked in harmony with **Pengzhuang** [蓬庄]. The elixir was thus perfected, and the Master’s **virtue/power** [德] became renowned. His grandson **Zhongxian** [忠显] admired Li Wumeng’s words, so he married his daughter to him, and they had three sons: **Tingzhen** [廷珍], **Tingrui** [廷瑞], and **Tinggui** [廷珪].\n\nThe Master was known for his **filial piety and respect for elders** [孝悌], and from youth, he was endowed with **keen intelligence** [聪明]. He mastered the **Classics and histories** [经史], often playing with children, and though he was **generous with wealth** [轻财], he **valued righteousness** [重义] above all. When he lent money or took pawns that could not be repaid, he burned the receipts.\n\nIn the autumn of **Dading** [大定] **Year Two**, a great locust plague and famine struck. A tenant, **Liu Jin** [刘进], stole and killed a plow ox, nearly exhausting its value. The Master went to him and said: *\"The harvest has failed, and you are in dire need of food. I will provide relief, but you should not have slaughtered the ox—the very foundation of your livelihood—without cause, driving an innocent creature to its death.\"* He ordered Liu Jin to carry the ox’s hide himself.\n\nThe old and young wailed in grief, and the Master told them: *\"The law is strict now; if you go, you will surely face punishment, and father and son will never meet again.\"* The Master said nothing more, then went to the **Jingge Yuan** [经阁院], offering five hides to the **Three Treasures** [三宝]—Liu Jin, kneeling before them, confessed his crime of killing the ox, hoping to clear his guilt.\n\nPeople sang of him:\n\n*\"In ancient times, there was **Yang Chenghuang** [杨陈皇],\nNow we speak of **Yipu** [宜甫].\"*\n\nA reckless youth came with three hundred coins to buy a **silk-lined jacket** [绫袄], but the Master gave him five hundred instead. The youth, resenting this small kindness, spat on his face. **Master Guo Fengxin** [郭奉信] scolded him and drove him away. Someone suggested wiping the spit from his face, but the Master said: *\"Wiping it would defy his anger; let him dry it himself.\"*\n\nThe Master told his **like-minded companions** [同志]: *\"Last night, I dreamed of two men, both clad in coarse robes. One had patched both shoulders, weeping as he begged me: ‘Our ten thousand lives rest in your hands.’\"*\n\nWhen he finished speaking, he fled into the South Lane, and I pursued him, seeing him enter the butcher’s shop of Liu Qing. Looking at the wall, I found an inscription that read:\n\n*\"Our ten thousand of the Year of the Boar [己亥],\nMost have already been slaughtered in the Year of the Snake [辛巳].\nIf this door lacks mercy,\nIn every lifetime, your head will be rubbed raw.\"*\n\nUpon waking from the dream, I heard the sound of pigs being slaughtered. I put on my clothes and looked—there were two bound pigs. One had white patches on both shoulders, and I realized that the man in my dream was this Year of the Boar pig. The Year of the Snake was the year Liu Gong was born. Thus, the inscription was written on the wall.\n\nThe butcher was harsh and unyielding, unable to be persuaded or transformed.\n\nThat evening, I dreamed of two cranes alighting in the vegetable garden, and so I built a Daoist hall and invited Master Lu, a Daoist priest, to reside there.\n\nIn the autumn of the Year of the Tiger [丁亥], the Master and Gao Jucai of Liaoyang were enjoying themselves at Fan Mingshu’s *Encountering the Immortal Pavilion*. After drinking deeply, he composed a poem, its final line reading:\n\n*\"Even in my drunkenness, there is one to steady me.\"*\n\nNone understood its meaning.\n\nThe day after the Mid-Autumn Festival, the Zhongyang True Person arrived from Zhongnan and reached Shumu. He went directly to the *Encountering the Immortal Pavilion*, where the Master asked: *\"From where have you come?\"*\n\nHe replied: *\"From a journey of thousands of miles—I came only to steady the drunkard.\"*\n\nAll were astonished by his words. The Master then asked: *\"What is your Daoist name?\"*\n\nThe True Person replied:\n*\"Where the Five Phases do not reach,\nBefore one’s parents gave birth to me.\"*\n\nThey spoke of the Mysterious, and before long, a wind arose upon the mat.\nThus, the Master invited the True Person to dwell in his household. His wife, Lady Fuchun, lifted the curtain to behold him and said to the Master:\n*\"I observe your guest’s face like a red lotus leaf, his eyes as green as jade, his voice like a great bell, his speech like a gushing spring—his bearing is noble, bearing the radiance of the True Yang. He is one worthy of wholehearted reverence.\"*\n\nFrom then on, they treated him with the rites due a teacher.\n\nThe True Person said to the Master:\n*\"I wish to seal myself in the hut for a hundred days without food.\"*\n\nThe Master complied, and a small chamber was prepared. Though winds and snows assailed it, the ink in his inkstone did not freeze. Outside, those seeking poems came and went like weaving threads; he would take up his brush, and verses would flow forth, complete in an instant.\n\nOften, his Yang Spirit would manifest and sit in the hall. The Master sent someone to gaze upon it, and there, within the hut, he sat in solemn silence.\n\nFrom the first auspicious day of the eleventh month, he revealed one poem and one word composition each, bidding the Master respond in kind. He then bestowed a single pear, which they ate together. Every five days, six yams or chestnuts were given; on the eleventh day, two pears, to be shared by the couple. Thereafter, for every ten days, the portion increased by one—three portions for thirty days, four for forty, until at a hundred days, it reached fifty-five pieces, harmonizing with the odd pairing of Heaven and Earth.\n\nThe Master gradually awakened to the True Principle and abandoned his wife and children, donning the Daoist cap and begging for alms to subdue his heart. The True Person rejoiced.\n\nOne day, the True Person spoke:\n*\"The Master has broken through the Dao.\"*\n\nThe Master asked:\n*\"How do you know this?\"*\n\nThe True Person replied:\n*\"Last night, I dreamed of drinking wine. I sent someone to inquire, and the Master said, ‘I took medicine with wine and drank too much.’ I knew of it beforehand.\"*\n\nHe then ascended Kunjian’s Misty and Verdant Grotto. Suddenly, the Master fell gravely ill with a splitting headache, as if his skull would burst. People said:\n*\"The Master may not live through the morning.\"*\n\nThe True Person declared:\n*\"I traveled three thousand miles to transform this man—how could I let him die?\"*\nHe dipped his hand in water and gave it to him. After drinking, the Master recovered.\n\nIn the autumn of the ninth year of the *Dading* era, the True Person led the Master and three others westward. The governor of Lingzhou, Xieshile, received them with teacherly rites and asked:\n*\"When shall we meet again?\"*\n\nThe True Person answered:\n*\"At Liang Garden.\"*\n\nLater, the True Person ascended to the clouds at Yimen. When Xieshile was later reassigned as deputy commander of the Southern Capital, he became the Master’s host for the funeral rites. After the True Person’s departure, the Master gathered his disciples and entered Jingzhao, begging for Daoist alms, obtaining tens of thousands. They then bound themselves in a vow to travel together, retrieving the True Person’s golden bones for reburial in Zhongnan. His hair was bound in three knots, and he mourned in seclusion for six years, sitting silently in his chamber.\n\nThe three knots symbolized the three auspicious characters—his posthumous name—so he held them in reverence.\n\nThe Master’s resolve was as unyielding as iron and stone, his conduct as uncompromising as frost and snow. For thirteen years, he wandered and transformed, wearing only coarse hemp, never touching money, and sleeping exposed beneath the stars. When people pitied his cold, he replied:\n*\"Do not marvel that I go without cover in the three winters—\nI have kept one spark in my elixir field.\"*\n\nOne day, he told his disciple, Lai Lingyu:\n*\"What do people of Guanzhong call it when a torn garment is mended?\"*\n\nLai Lingyu answered:\n*\"They call it *zhexi*—folding and washing.\"*\n\nThe Master said:\n*\"The Daoist teachings here have grown tattered and broken—\nI must mend them.\"*\n\nBefore half a month had passed, an imperial edict arrived, ordering Daoist priests to return to their native regions. The Master then departed the pass.\n\nMaster Changchun Qiu was then in Longshan. One day, he said to Li Daxiong:\n*\"The Dao here is bound. Though I am listed in the edict, I cannot leave the pass. If I were to leave, the Daoist winds of Qin would be swept clean away.\"*\n\nHe descended the mountain with the green robes, and the officials and people of the prefecture jointly petitioned to retain him. He returned to his mountain dwelling.\n\nAfter the Master left the pass, wherever he went, the villagers wore their hair in topknots and donned white, singing and dancing in the streets. As he approached, they flocked to greet him like phoenixes and auspicious stars, vying to catch a glimpse of him.\n\nUpon returning to his native village, he met the butcher Liu Qing and instructed him: *\"In the past, when you asked me about the verse on the wall, twenty years had already passed unnoticed—counting by the day, you slaughter three beasts daily, and even ten thousand would be insufficient. How much more so for you, a man of eighty-three winters, with a vast lineage and noble family? It is only right to cease killing.\"*\n\nThe man then awoke to reason and chose a day to hold a vegetarian feast, carrying his chopping block and utensils to the city gate to burn them.\n\nThat day, he visited the Golden Lotus Hall, where the six flavors—bitter, sour, salty, and the rest—were unfit for offering. The Master stood by the well and struck it with his foot; the water became sweet as *li* spring, and the county folk called it the \"Numinous Elixir.\" They built a pavilion and erected a stele, spreading the tale far and wide.\n\nIn the year *Rén-Yín* (壬寅), the fifth month, a great drought struck Shùmòu, withering the young crops. The people implored the rivers and mountains in vain, but when the prefectural and county officials respectfully invited the Master, hoping for even a drop of his virtue, a single incense’s worth of warmth arose, and a downpour of nourishing rain fell.\n\nBy the seventh month of autumn, the county folk held a grand *jiào* ritual at the Cháoyuán Observatory. Days of gloomy rain left the laity and Daoists in dismay, fearing the altar would be ruined. The Master said, *\"Fear not—today will surely clear.\"* And so it was.\n\nWhen the time came to burn the *wén* scriptures at the Mid-Autumn Festival, five clouds coiled about the sky, and cranes and phoenixes lingered in the air. Such was the swiftness of his response.\n\nIn mid-winter, as he passed through Dēngzhou, the devotee Hàn Gōng burned incense and prayed: *\"My family’s well is bitter—if only you would deign to lend your power, perhaps its taste might change.\"* The Master went and chanted over it, and instantly the water turned sweet as honey.\n\nAs evening fell and rain began, he stayed overnight at Hàn’s residence. In jest, he wrote:\n*\"Outside the gate, the rain patters—*\n*Heaven keeps the guest, but not the host.*\n*My lord may yet endure,*\n*But smash the Daoist’s skull!\"*\n\nNone understood the last line until Master Kāngzhēn came to inquire, when suddenly a tile from the eaves fell and struck him squarely on the head. Only then did the crowd grasp the meaning of the final verse.\n\nOn the Double Ninth Festival, after the *jiào* ritual concluded, the Celestial Gate opened in the southwest, and auspicious clouds gathered at the moon’s edge. The county folk could not help but bow in reverence.\n\nOn the eighth day of the second month, the Master urged the villagers of Lángyá in Shùmòu to burn all their fishing nets and boats. The wind shifted, the snow melted, and suddenly, a towering emerald peak appeared—a marvel that stunned all, for it was the *hǎishì* (sea-market illusion) manifesting in Nányáng.\n\nIn the year *Guǐmǎo* (癸卯), on the thirteenth day of the fourth month, as the Master conducted a *jiào* ritual in Zhīyáng, a violent storm arose. The crowd lamented, hoping for clear skies. The Master clenched his teeth and stared vacantly, as if in prayer. Soon, the clouds dispersed and the sun emerged.\n\nIn the afternoon of the fifteenth, a dragon’s tail appeared in the southwest, lingering for some time before vanishing. That night, colored clouds pierced the moon.\n\nOn the twenty-eighth of the fourth month, as he traveled to Zhīyáng, the *hǎishì* reappeared, visible from dawn until noon.\n\nWhen the Master reached the Huíguāng Hermitage, Mǎ Cóngshì joyfully offered to burn a thousand *hú* of grain certificates in repayment. Later, Jūfù gathered fishing nets to burn them, and the *hǎishì* reappeared, faintly resembling a dragon carriage and crane-drawn chariot. Two others, Guō Hēng and Lè Zhōu, also gathered nets to burn, and suddenly, the island of Sāng appeared between them, with battle formations arrayed in shifting ranks—like the array of divine soldiers and armored cavalry.\n\nWhile residing in Huátíng’s humble abode, a *línzhēn* tree stood withered and dead, its branches brittle, its heart rotten, ready to be felled for firewood. On the ninth day of the fourth month, the Master watered it, and soon afterward, his disciple Yáo Xuān arrived with the *jiāpǔ* of Pure Yang True Person. It was then revealed that the tree had been planted on the fourteenth day of the fourth month, when Pure Yang True Person was born beneath it. The Master smiled: *\"I was born on the twentieth of the fifth month—by now, its leaves and branches should have sprouted.\"* He composed a verse:\n\n*\"Thirty-six above, thirty-six below,*\n*Heaven and Earth enter the Treasure Vase,*\n*Seventy-two *hòu* complete the measure.\"*\n\nLi Gōng knelt and begged for an explanation, but the Master laughed: *\"This is a hidden saying—you will understand it in time.\"*\n\nOn the seventeenth of the fifth month, Li Gōng dreamed that the *línzhēn* tree sprouted two leaves on either side. When he awoke and examined it, new shoots had indeed taken root.\n\nBy the time of the Master’s birthday celebration, the branches had grown thick with green shade. Only then did he explain the verse: *\"Four nines make thirty-six days; Heaven and Earth combine for seventy-two days—when *qi* and climate are full, how could decay not turn to flourishing?\"*\n\nAt the Quánzhēn Hermitage, two clumps of bamboo and a pine were transplanted in the fourth month, their leaves withered and yellow. Daoist friend Cuī Gōng asked the Master if they might revive. The Master cheerfully composed two poems:\n\n*\"The Daoist’s gate is called ‘Long Life,’*\n*Yet seeks to reverse decay’s design.*\n*Let these few stalks forever stay green,*\n*No leaf shall dare turn pale or lean.\"*\n\nAnd again:\n\n*\"I master the Law of Life’s rotation,*\n*Shifting *qi* to transform the frame.*\n*Not just the scholar’s bamboo stays green,*\n*Now even the minister’s pine regains its prime.\"*\n\nHe then watered them with his face-washing water, and within a decade, new shoots emerged, their hearts unfolding into leaves.\n\nAt the Jīnyù Hermitage, six small pines were planted on the third day of the sixth month. The crowd knelt and said: *\"The pine and bamboo of Quánzhēn Hermitage have revived—why do these six young pines of Jīnyù wither so?\"*\n\nThe Master then infused them with his true *qi* three times, composing three short poems:\n\n*\"Six pines planted in June’s heat,*\n*Yet return to life like spring’s breeze.*\n*Though my breath is scant, my will is strong—*\n*Six wishes fulfilled, great merit earned.\"*\n\nAnd again:\n\n*\"In past summers, pines were planted,*\n*Daoist friends tested the wind’s might.*\n*I said six would not take root,*\n*Yet fame spreads of the Three-Tufted’s might.\"*\n\n*\"Six pines planted on the third of June,*\n*Their colors changed by the wind’s breath.*\n*I borrow the Double Ninth’s *qi* to pray,*\n*As legend says, the Three-Tufted’s power holds sway.\"*\n\nThe pines did not alter branch or leaf, their verdure lovely beyond compare. The villagers then carved his poems onto stone.\n\nLong ago, Lü Dongbin revived a withered sophora tree in Lái zhōu’s Longxīng Temple with a single pill and a poem, which still stands today. His verse reads:\n\n*\"Long sleeves trailing from my river-bank retreat,*\n*Night lodged in the ancient hall of the *zhī* temple.\"*\n\nThe city without night preserves the saint’s trace,\nYet bids the old sophora endure a thousand winters.\n\nNow the Master revives the Six Pines of Zhiyang with three verses—\nBefore and after the sages, their essence is one.\n\nA poor scholar of Zhiyang, both feet crippled,\nCried out in pain one day—\nThe Master sighed, gave him water to drink,\nAnd when he finished, his steps flew like the wind.\n\nA man from Lewu, long afflicted by wind-damp,\nFound no cure in a hundred medicines—\nThe Master gave him a pill, and in a day, he was fully healed.\n\nOne day, the Master suddenly sang and danced in joy,\nHis disciples hurried in: *\"On the last day of the twelfth month,\nIn the year of the Male Ox, Sun Xianjiu passed away in Henan,\nAt sixty-four years of age.\"*\n\nThe Master said: *\"Last night, I rode the colored clouds,\nHeard celestial music, and returned to the Eastern Sea—\nI saw her myself.\nMy dancing was for this—\nI had known it beforehand.\"*\n\nThat year, in the ninth month,\nAt the *Kunjian Qiyue An*, he presided over the *Guohun* ritual,\nWith auspicious mists shimmering, cranes and phoenixes coming and going—\nToo many to count.\n\nIn *Shu* Mountain, he built the Seven-Treasure Hermitage,\nDug a well nine *chi* deep but found no spring—\nA great stone blocked the way.\nThe Master inscribed:\n*\"Dig deeper still to the Double Nine’s depth,*\n*The sweet spring will surely answer the pure call.\"*\n\nWorkmen were ordered to dig again, down to eighteen *chi*,\nAnd cold water gushed forth.\n\nA Seven-Treasure Hermitage oxcart carried a massive *liang* tree,\nOver treacherous paths—\nThe driver nearly collapsed in the traces,\nHis chest heaving, his breath ragged—\nYet when he chanted the *Danyang* name,\nHe suffered no harm.\n\nIn the third month of the year of the Male Ox,\nHe rested at the *Shun* Temple in Jinan—\nOld and young alike vied to pay homage,\nThousands crowding in at the gates,\nBreaking off the door’s hinges.\n\nStanding tall and unharmed,\nIn the twelfth month, he transplanted two *wú* trees—tall as several *rén*—\nPlanted in the Seven-Treasure Hermitage, they withered with time.\nThe Master first struck them with true *qi*, then breathed upon them,\nAnd with water poured over them, in ten days’ time their verdant hue returned.\n\nOn the *Xiàyuán* day, Master Wénshān presided over the *jiào* rites,\nYet days of unbroken rain had the crowd in dismay.\nThe Master heard a voice from the void say:\n*\"The Reborn-on-Double-Nine Immortal arrives.\"*\nMaolai and Ergong stood nearby and heard it too.\n\nOn the sixteenth day, at the *bǔ* hour,\nCountess Ní Lì Gǔ Wǔ Jié gazed upward—\nA celestial figure in green headband and white robes appeared,\nSeated upon a white *pí* and lotus leaf of emerald hue,\nThe tortoise beneath him swayed its tail.\nOld Hundred-Longevity exclaimed:\n*\"This is the painted Lord from the scroll!\"*\nHastily, incense and offerings were prepared—all paid homage.\nSuddenly, the Immortal turned and reclined, vanishing southward.\n\nThe Master composed *\"Mǎn Tíng Fāng\"* to record the event,\nAnd the townsfolk carved it upon stone.\n\nLáiyáng invited the Master to the *Yóuxiān Guān* to discuss the *jiào* rites.\nIn mid-December, the Master replied:\n*\"We shall meet again in three days.\"*\n\nOn the twenty-second day, at the hour of Reborn-on-Double-Nine’s descent,\nThe Master commanded Zhīyī to dance *\"Guīcháo Huān.\"*\nGazing upward, he saw the Reborn-on-Double-Nine Master and Hé Gōng’s teacher\nAscending slowly through the air.\nThe Master said:\n*\"Majestic return to the Dao—be a joyous immortal!\"*\nAnd again:\n*\"At the peak of grandeur, why not depart with a sweep of the sleeve?\"*\nHe called his disciple Liú Zhēnyī and said:\n*\"If you wish to become immortals, it is not so simple.\nWhen faced with trials, do not falter—be ever more cautious,\nAnd only then may you attain it.\nTake these words to heart and never forget.\"*\n\nThen he bound his hair and, facing outward, told the disciples:\n*\"With eyes open, I see; with eyes closed, I see.\nSeeing is not in the eyes—when the heart is clear, all is seen.\"*\n\nConversing with his disciples, as the second watch neared,\nA storm raged—thunder cracked, and the Master’s body ascended in flight.\n\nGuō Fùzhōng, the wine-tax supervisor, heard frantic knocking at the gate.\nHe went out to see—it was the Master.\nHe led him inside to converse, then asked for paper to write a verse:\n*\"Sixty-one years on earth, unrecognized by all,\nA sudden clap of thunder—soaring with the wind’s call.\"*\n\nAfter some time, he took leave and departed swiftly.\nA villager named Liú Xí saw, that night, light in the house’s cracks,\nLike a lamp’s glow. At dawn, he found a scroll—\nTaken down with a bamboo pole—four lines of verse:\n*\"The Three Yang gather to fulfill the Rounded Work,\nThe Wind-Horse rides the wind—now an immortal made.\nI urge you to subdue the Dragon and Tiger,\nAnd naturally ascend to heaven’s share.\"*\n\nLater, he inscribed the Master’s posthumous name.\nHe hurried to burn it, and the scent of *dùnjiān* filled the house.\nSoon, word came:\n*\"Last night, the Master ascended.\"*\n\nOnly then did Guō Fùzhōng and Liú Xí realize they had seen his *yángshén*.\n\nSeven days passed before his form appeared serene.\nHe was buried at the *Yóuxiān Guān*.\n\nEarlier, the *Shùhuá* Hermitage had tens of pines,\nTheir branches and leaves all turned white.\nThe Master said:\n*\"This white pine—perhaps it is for me.\"*\n\nOn the eighteenth day of the first month, *jiǎchén* year,\nScholar-official Liú Shàozǔ and others saw in the sky\n*Luánhè* circling, clouds shifting—\nThe Reborn-on-Double-Nine Immortal in cloud-crown and crimson robes,\nAnd Dan’yáng Master in three-topknot white garb,\nManifesting above the clouds before departing after some time.\n\nOn the twelfth day of the fifth month, *jǐhài* evening,\nThe Master suddenly appeared northwest of the *Yìngxiān Qiáo*,\nWith celestial attendants beside him.\nSoon, cold clouds obscured him—\nAt the time, Yú Xìn and twenty others witnessed it.\n\nAfter the Master’s burial, the townsfolk suspected\nThat Shǎnxī disciples had stolen his immortal remains.\nUntil the twenty-fourth day of the first month, *yǐsǐ* year,\nCounty Magistrate Liú had the coffin opened—\nHis features lived on, his limbs supple.\nHe was reattired and combed, and pilgrims flocked from afar,\nTheir footsteps unending.\n\nBy the ninth month, he was reburied in a stone coffin.\nHis works—*Fēnlí Shíhuà*, *Jiànwù*, *Jīngwēi*, *Zhāiwēi*,\n*Sānbǎo*, *Xínghuà*, *Jīnyù*—were published.\nTheir meaning penetrates the Three Teachings,\nEmbraces the Five Phases,\nResponds to past and present,\nUses objects to instruct,\nDiscusses profound truths—\nAs if the Penglai Isles stood before one’s eyes.\nWith wisdom’s blade and insight’s sword,\nHe banished the Three Corpses beyond the body,\nAnd following him leads to virtue, far from guilt.\nUnderstanding him grants sainthood, transcending humanity—\nHow could this be of little benefit?\n\n**Praise:**\nFirst encountering Reborn-on-Double-Nine,\nClarifying the Nine Transformations,\nTen stages of dividing the pear—\nSecretly transmitting hints,\nSix returns bestowing yams—\nHidden mechanisms unfold.\nPiercing the Jade Gate before *yuanqi*’s birth,\nPointing beyond the Five Phases’ reach,\nOpening the Golden Door, entering the Metal Gate,\nGathering sun and moon within the jar,\nConcentrating clouds and mists in the cauldron.\nUnfurling half the state’s bounty,\nCrowning the three-topknot’s measure—\nDecades of snow-sleep, frost-dream,\nTen thousand miles of mountain-crossing, water-wading,\nSeven golden lotuses blooming first and fully,\nFive secret discourses passed alone.\nA thunderclap—fulfilling the red-cloud vow,\nFor countless eons in green, returning to blue’s play.\n\nHe awakened the Perfect Truth,\nExpanded the Mysterious Teaching.\n\nZhang Shén’tóng’s poem:\n*\"The foremost scholar of the Eastern Sea,\nReborn-on-Double-Nine once lifted him from drunkenness.\nHow many past and present cultivators\nPale in comparison to this Master?\"*\n\n**Record of the Golden Lotus Orthodoxy, Volume Three, Complete.**\n*#1: The original character \"止\" was changed to \"上\" based on the Jíyào edition.*\n\nLongzhēn Tán Zhēnrén—\nThe Master, surnamed Tán, given name Yù, courtesy name Bóyù, was his ancestral name, residing in Nínghǎi.\nA man of bold generosity, his wisdom and discernment were extraordinary; filial piety and righteousness passed down in his family, highly esteemed by the neighborhood.\nIn the winter of Dīnghài in the Dàdìng era, he suffered from vertigo and paralysis, lingering without relief. Though he consumed many medicines, none took effect.\nHearing of Zhòngyáng Master arriving from Zhōngnán, he, still staying idly at Mǎ Jūn’s residence in Yífǔ, leaned on his cane and went to pay respects, seeking healing methods.\nThe Master refused to admit him at the door, yet he persisted, knocking and calling all night without pause. Suddenly, the door opened on its own.\nZhòngyáng Master rejoiced greatly, deeming him a soul bound by Daoist affinity, and thus invited him to share his bed with Cluán Zhì.\nThey conversed intimately beyond that of old friends. By dawn, his former ailments vanished entirely—his limbs light and nimble, he moved like the wind, only then realizing Zhòngyáng Master’s extraordinary nature.\nHe abandoned wealth and gold as if they were filth, begging to serve at the Master’s side for life without retreat. The Master bestowed upon him a Daoist name: Chǔduān, a courtesy name of Tōngzhèng, and the title of Chángzhēn Zǐ.\nHe gifted a poem:\n*\"Beyond the Pass of Yin-Yang Creation,\nA single heart toward Dao, never turning back.\nThe Pure Way of the Vermilion Court is truly the path of the Immortal,\nOnly settle and cultivate the inner radiance.\"*\n\nOnce the Master received his teachings, he extinguished the self and worldly attachments, abandoned all thoughts, wore a green headband, and donned coarse linen robes.\nIn the year Wùzǐ of the Dàdìng era, he bade farewell to relatives and neighbors, following his Master’s side, and journeyed south to Biāngliáng.\nHe attended morning and evening, gaining much of the Mysterious Dao’s essence.\nBy the third year, his Master ascended to the Celestial Court upon the clouds, and he returned west to Liú Jiāng with the Master’s remains, burying them with proper rites.\nAfterward, he withdrew to the region between Yī and Luò, refining his spirit and cultivating his *qi*.\nThough he lingered in places of old red roads and purple paths, flower-lined groves, and wine-soaked battlefields, his heart remained as motionless as earth and wood.\nNot even ten thousand taels of gold could make him bend his waist.\nHe drifted until reaching Shuǐnán’s Celestial Court Palace, where Lǎngrán Zǐ had refined his elixir.\nThus, he cherished the place and never left.\nLater, when crowds gathered at the gate, he alone begged for food without cease.\nOnce passing through Zhāotí, he sought remnants of food from a Zen master, who flew into a rage and struck him with a fist, breaking two teeth.\nThe Master swallowed the blood with composure, while onlookers sought to intervene—yet he smiled and bowed, utterly unmoved.\nFrom then on, his fame spread through Jīngluò.\n\nHe had always loved the characters **龟 (guī)** and **蛇 (shé)**, practicing their forms tirelessly until his brushwork reached a divine state,\nas if the strokes themselves could soar and transform.\nDevoted Daoist disciples collected and treasured them as precious relics.\nLater, when a fire consumed his estate and spread to a hundred households, only those who kept these two characters remained unharmed.\n\nOne day, he instructed his disciples:\n*\"Zhòngyáng Master and I have a pact with Pénglái—now he departs!\"*\nAs he spoke, five-colored auspicious clouds swirled around the courtyard, and green cranes and white storks soared in and out.\nThen, he bound his hair and faced south, resting his arm as a pillow, and shed his mortal frame on the first day of the fourth month.\n\nHis secular songs and compositions numbered nearly hundreds, titled *Shuǐyún*—\ndeeply mastering the Dao of **铅 (qiān)** and **汞 (gǒng)**, and the **沂 (Yí) River’s flow**.\nHe practiced widely in the world.\n\nThe eulogy says:\n*\"The aged Daoist Immortal of Longzhēn,\nA bold warrior of Nínghǎi,\nShared studies with the Three-Topknot Master,\nAnd knelt before Zhòngyáng to receive his oath.\nOne night’s conversation left unfinished,\nA decade’s madness instantly cured.\nHe scorned a thousand gold pieces,\nAnd hung his hundred *nà* robes with glad poverty.\nRefining *qi* and calming spirit,\nHe wandered for years beneath Luò’s skies,\nReturning to his roots and fulfilling his destiny—\nHalf his life spent never crossing back to Shāndōng.\nTaming a hundred demons with hidden form,\nThe two characters **龟 (guī)** and **蛇 (shé)**—\nSeizing the Two Principles in his grasp,\nThe Nine Return of Dragon and Tiger.\nJust as the fragrant osmanthus bloomed,\nAnd the golden lotus shone resplendent.\n**铅 (qiān)** and **汞 (gǒng)** inscribed in the *Shuǐyún* collection,\nSmoke and mist as his playful retreat in Pénghuái.\nIf not for bones and flesh ascending together,\nAnd form and spirit both attaining transcendence—\nWho could match this Master?\"*\n\nZhang Shéntóng’s poem:\n*\"A heart of iron against wind and fire,\nA true hero who embraces the Dao’s return.\nIn spring’s warmth, his spirit wanders in Luòyáng,\nStill holding the **龟 (guī)** and **蛇 (shé)** talismans in the north.\nThe Master of True Longevity, Liú Zhēnrén—\nA descendant of the Eastern Sea’s golden lineage,\nA remnant of the Han’s illustrious virtue,\nGraceful as clouds, majestic as peaks,\nNoble as the essence of Yùe’s mountains,\nVast as the lakes—his depth and brilliance cannot be contained by stars or constellations.\nHis ancestors and forefathers dwelled in Wǔguān,\nCherishing hidden virtue, delighting in bestowing kindness,\nRelieving the cold and hungry, benefiting orphans and the aged,\nDonating eighty acres of fertile land to Lóngxīng’s grand monastery,\nAs the eternal root for nurturing blessings.\nIn the era of Tàipíng Xīngguó,\nThe court praised his filial piety and righteousness,\nHonoring his family with banners,\nExempting them from taxes and levies—\nHis virtue shone across neighboring counties.\nHeaven did not forsake the virtuous—\nFrom the Vermilion Cloud and Golden Landscape,\nIt selected his refined immortal essence,\nAnd bestowed auspicious signs upon Yèchéng.\nThough he stood apart from the world,\nHe reverently served his widowed mother,\nRenowned for his filial devotion,\nSwearing never to wed or seek office,\nDisdaining fame and wealth,\nGuarding his purity like a simpleton,\nThe affairs of the world could not shake his steadfast sincerity.\nHe repeatedly declined his ancestral home,\nAspiring to seek the extraordinary—\nYet his compassionate mother’s longing held him back.\nIn the spring of Jǐchǒu in the Dàdìng era,\nHe suddenly saw two verses inscribed on his neighbor’s wall—\nIn places no one else could reach—\nThe ink still fresh, no name left behind.\nThe final lines read:\n*'In Wǔguān, the land of True Nature’s cultivation,\nThere must be one who achieves immortal longevity without death.'*\nThe Master delighted in the bold and forceful strokes,\nSuspecting they were the work of a divine being,\nYet he could not confirm their meaning.\nThat autumn, in the ninth month,\nWith frost and dew in the air,\nZhòngyáng Master, leaning on his staff and sandals,\nJourneyed westward, gathering the three Immortals—\nTán, Liú, and Mǎ—\nCrossing the sea island, traversing the mountain city.\nThe Master heard of it and hurried with devotion,\nOffering incense and fire to welcome him.\nZhòngyáng Master turned and smiled:\n*'Do you recognize the ink on the wall?'*\"\n\nIn the Year of the Ox, suddenly within the neighbor’s wall—\nWhere none else could reach—\nHe saw two bold verses freshly inked,\nNo name left behind,\nTheir closing lines declaring:\n*\"In Wǔguān, the land of True Nature’s cultivation,\nThere must be one who achieves immortal longevity without death.\"*\n\nThe Master marveled at their forceful strokes,\nSuspecting they were the work of a divine being,\nYet could not verify their meaning.\n\nThat autumn, in the ninth month,\nWith frost and dew in the air,\nZhòngyáng Master, leaning on his staff and sandals,\nJourneyed westward, gathering the three Immortals—\nTán, Liú, and Mǎ—\nCrossing the sea island, traversing the mountain city.\nThe Master heard of it and hurried with devotion,\nOffering incense and fire to welcome him.\nZhòngyáng Master turned and smiled:\n*\"Do you recognize the ink on the wall?\"*\n\nThe three disciples also exchanged glances and chilly smiles,\nThen realized the verses were divine manifestations meant to startle them.\nThey thus carved their sincerity into their very bones,\nPledged their loyalty with unyielding resolve,\nCarrying their stools and staffs,\nHolding their towels and bottles,\nObeying his every command,\nLetting life and death follow his will.\nThe Master, moved by their earnestness,\nAdmired their single-minded dedication,\nAnd their extraordinary aura beyond mortal kind,\nExclaimed with a sigh:\n*\"In the month of pine, beneath the snow of bamboo,\nI have no need for the yellow dust of the world.\"*\n\nHe composed a poem in reply:\n*\"After casting my line, I return to see the tortoise,\nNow knowing my fate—ranked among the celestial Immortals.*\n*The crane and the fish call to each other, understanding my intent,\nRising from the waves a thousand feet high.*\n*Taking the verses’ meaning to heart,\nI name ‘Longevity’ as my title,\n‘Mystic’ as my surname,\n‘Penetrating Marvel’ as my given character—*\n*At the time, I was but a year past my twentieth spring.*\n*The names of Qióu, Liú, Tán, and Mǎ filled the Nine Wilds and Eight Strings,*\n*Traveling in Biānlíng, dwelling at Yímén,*\n*Begging for alms to refine my form,*\n*Hiding my true name in obscurity,*\n*Knocking at dawn, pleading at dusk,*\n*Sitting in steaming incense, walking in perfumed smoke,*\n*Skillfully unraveling the profound mysteries,*\n*Diligently expounding the sacred texts,*\n*Clearing away illusions like clouds,*\n*Dispelling delusions like mist.*\n\n*The Master, having fully imparted the Four Symbols and Five Elements,*\n*Then departed, leaving his mortal vessel behind,*\n*Retreating into heaven—*\n*As the saying goes: ‘Finding a true friend, he ascends to Pénglái.’*\n*The four disciples carried their Immortal bodies,*\n*Repaying his boundless grace,*\n*Knocking at Xiànyáng, passing through Huáyīn,*\n*Calming their spirits in the radiant glow of Liú Jiāng’s former hall.*\n*Though each had different aspirations,*\n*The Master alone concealed his traces in Luòjīng,*\n*Refined his nature amid the dust of the world,*\n*Nurtured his purity in the chaotic hum of the marketplace,*\n*Where neither music nor flowers could distract his harmony,*\n*Nor the pleasures of life perturb his clarity.*\n*His heart grew colder with each passing day,*\n*His body stilled like wood in winter.*\n\n*When others worked, he ate without complaint,*\n*When none asked, his face remained unruffled,*\n*When questioned, he answered with a gesture,*\n*When left alone, his silence was absolute.*\n*His willpower was flawless,*\n*His inner light radiant as heaven.*\n*He then moved to the banks of Yúnxī,*\n*And his disciples carved a cave dwelling into the rocky slopes.*\n*Suddenly, he encountered an ancient well with cold, clear water,*\n*The crowd astonished by its strangeness,*\n*The Master laughing said:*\n*'Just a few steps away, there are two more wells—*\n*They are the places where I cultivated in past lives.'*\n*When dug, they were indeed found,*\n*And to this day, the cave is called the ‘Three Wells.’*\n\n*In the Year of the Ram (Dìngshēn),*\n*He returned to Wǔguān,*\n*To pay respects to his mother,*\n*Their reunion filled with joy.*\n*He chose a site beneath the shadow of Tàojī,*\n*And built the Hall of Lingxū,*\n*Planting cypress trees with his own hands,*\n*Their verdant rows stretching into the distance.*\n*Soon after, the local villagers falsely accused him of murder,*\n*And he went without protest to be bound.*\n*He endured the slander of the fox-trapers for nearly ten weeks.*\n\n*Pure Yang Master, hearing the water clock,*\n*Riding the Azure Unicorn,*\n*Descending from the Azure Sky,*\n*Entering the Mystic Realm,*\n*Meeting at Liǔwěi,*\n*Commissioned him to study under Guǎnchéng,*\n*And taught him the art of calligraphy.*\n*Later, the murderer confessed himself,*\n*And the Master was spared the punishment of imprisonment.*\n\n*When he emerged,*\n*His brushwork was divine,*\n*With dragons and serpents leaping from the ink.*\n*In the Year of the Great Peace (Dàdìng),*\n*He presided over the grand ritual at Chāngyáng,*\n*Where colorful clouds veiled the altar,*\n*And white cranes danced in the courtyard.*\n*That year, the autumn drought scorched the land,*\n*Yet he earnestly prayed for rain.*\n*Standing upon the ritual platform,*\n*He looked around and saw no clouds,*\n*Then said:*\n*'By the hour of the cock tomorrow,*\n*There will be sweet, heavy rain as if from a flood.'*\n*His words proved true,*\n*Like echoes responding to sound and form.*\n\n*Afterward, whenever he led the grand rituals in Shùzhōu,*\n*There was always a blessed wind that swirled,*\n*Rising to carry the paper offerings aloft,*\n*His influence as divine as the heavens,*\n*To this day, the stone inscriptions remain in every district.*\n\n*In the third year of Chéng’ān,*\n*The Emperor Zhāng heard of his Dao’s worth,*\n*And sent envoys to summon him,*\n*With a tortoise-shaped boat and a reed mat,*\n*To escort him to the Purple Palace,*\n*Treating him as a honored guest,*\n*Granting him the surname ‘Lín’*\n*And the name ‘Xiūzhēn.’*\n*The officials and commoners came in endless procession,*\n*His doorstep never empty.*\n\n*The following spring, in the third month,*\n*He begged to return to his native mountain,*\n*The Emperor, unable to refuse,*\n*Bestowed the title ‘Língxū’*\n*And honored his ancestral hall.*\n\n*On the auspicious day of the sixth month,*\n*In the Year of the Ox (Gǔihài),*\n*Drums were beaten and the crowd gathered,*\n*And he announced his journey to the Board of Literature.*\n*Leaning on his left arm,*\n*He returned to True Nature,*\n*His radiance enveloping the heavens,*\n*His sacred qi swirling in auspicious patterns.*\n*All his remaining works—*\n*The ‘Music of the Immortals,’ ‘Great Void,’ ‘Swirling Yang,’ ‘Mingling with Dust,’ ‘Serene Ease,’ ‘Perfecting the True’—*\n*Still expound the ‘Dao Dé,’*\n*Interpret the ‘Yīnfú,’*\n*And elucidate the ‘Huángtíng.’*\n*His insights delve into the depths of truth,*\n*His teachings reveal the sacred essence,*\n*Sufficient as a guide for all ages to come.*\n\n*The praise reads:*\n*\"The Old Immortal of Longevity,\nProclaims the transformation of authority,\nSwallows the Void, spits out Nature,\nRiding the purple clouds to descend and wander—\nAt the edge of the Azure Sea,\nMeeting the cosmic cycle of the Heavenly Stem and Earthly Branch,\nBinding with Pure Yang across countless kalpas.*\n*He strikes the hundred barriers,*\n*Pierces the Nine Abysses,*\n*Drives the Four Beasts,*\n*Tills the Three Fields,*\n*Sits in the marketplace of Luòyáng,*\n*Carves out the Celestial Cavern of Yúnxī.*\n*Melting white snow into powder,*\n*Refining black frost without smoke.*\n*His fame resounds in Fèngzhōu,*\n*His glory shines in Jīnlián.*\n*He builds the hall of Linglú,*\n*Bows to the imperial edict,*\n*And then settles the ancient debt of Shù-Lài,*\n*Only then do flesh and spirit reunite,*\n*Feasting and reveling in the Eight Extremes.\"*\n\n*Zhāng Shéntóng’s poem reads:*\n*\"Deep within the Penglai peaks, the truth is revealed,\nA single spark of clarity piercing the dust.*\n*After ascending beyond the winds of Shù,*\n*Lingxū quietly seals the spring in its jade hall.\"*\n\n---\n\n**Long Spring Qióu Zhēnren**\nZhēnren’s surname was Qióu, given name Chǔjī.\nHe was called **Long Spring Child**.\nHis family lineage traced back to Qīxiá,\nWhere they were most distinguished.\n\nBy nature, he was quick and had a prodigious memory,\nHis learning vast and his talent extraordinary.\n\nThe brow and countenance serene and unconstrained,\nEvery gesture and bearing refined and deliberate,\nThose skilled in physiognomy declared: *\"Your honor bears tortoise markings—\nYou shall surely become the sage of emperors and kings.\"*\n\nBefore reaching his minority, he ardently emulated the **Daoist currents**,\nDiscussing nothing but the **Way of Eternal Life and Long Vision**,\nSinging nothing but the **soaring phoenix and winged dragon** of transcendence.\n\nIn the spring of **Dàdìng** year **Dīnghài**,\nHe heard of **Chóngyáng** in **Kūnjiàn Mountain’s** *Yānxīá Cave*,\nAnd with eager steps, he sought him out.\nClad in coarse robes, he knelt to receive instruction.\n\n**Chóngyáng**, seeing him, took delight,\nAnd spoke with him through the night—\nTheir **Daoist insights** harmonized,\nThus he gifted him this verse:\n\n*\"Fine scales gleam like gold in emerald waters,\nSeeking fragrant bait to swallow the hook with ease.\nGranted leisure to wind my silken thread,\nDrawn into Penglai’s boundless freedom forever.\"*\n\nThe Master bowed in reverence and accepted it,\nServing at his side day and night,\nContent to take on menial tasks,\nFollowing his teacher through mountains and seas,\nSouthward to **Biànliáng**,\nAs time passed, his resolve grew ever steadier,\nHis bond with the teacher surpassing even **glue and lacquer**,\nAnd his **Daoist enlightenment** deepened with each revelation.\n\nOne day, an elder teacher called him to the **Penglai gathering**,\nAnd he departed, leaving all behind—\nAscending to the **Heavenly Dao** itself.\nAfter the grand funeral rites concluded,\nHe journeyed westward to **Fèngxiáng**,\nBegging food at **Tàigōng’s** fishing spot by **Wènduān Creek**,\nConquering slumber, dispelling stray thoughts,\nFor seven years, his face never touched a cushion,\nA single **waterproof cloak and hat**,\nUnchanged through scorching heat and biting cold—\nMen named him the **Cloak-Hat Master**,\nIn perfect accord with **emptiness**, his understanding penetrating **Daoist profundity**.\n\nHe returned to **Liú-Jiāng**,\nConsidering it the old retreat of his teacher,\nReluctant to leave, unable to depart.\n\nIn the spring of **Dàdìng** year **Wùshēn**, the **Second Month**,\nThe **Emperor** heard of his name and sent envoys to summon him to court.\nThe gifts bestowed were lavish,\nAnd he was appointed to dwell at **Tiāncháng Guān**.\nIn time, he was entrusted to conduct the **Jiézhǔ ritual** for the **Effigy Master**.\n\nOn the first day of the **Fourth Month**,\nBy imperial decree, he was appointed **Superintendent of the Quánzhēn Hall**,\nAnd the emperor himself inscribed the **sealed character plaque** above it.\n\nOn the **First Day of the Fifth Month**, he was summoned to **Chángsōng Island**,\nAnd again on the **Tenth Day of the Seventh Month**,\nWhere he expounded on the **principles of Heaven and humanity**,\nElucidating the **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power** of the **Quánzhēn tradition**,\nDeeply pleasing the imperial will.\n\nIn response to the imperial command, he presented the *Sutra of the First Layer of Yáotai*:\n*\"When the **Celestial Dragon’s treasure** takes flight,*\n*And all spirits of the **Four Seas** gather in homage,*\n*\"The myriad affairs of governance grow tranquil,*\n*The **Three Pure Ones*** harmonize in counsel—\n*No spears or banners are raised.*\n\n*Jade towers and golden halls stretch wide,*\n*Moon platforms and wind pavilions overlook the pool.*\n*In stillness, the **Way of Non-action*** prevails,\n*Gliding in painted boats,*\n*Rowing past the **cooling mats** and **chess tables** at dusk.*\n\n*Only when the **former sage*** establishes his **auspicious work***\nDoes **Great Peace** truly manifest—\n*The **Dao** is rare, the gathering hard to meet.*\n\n*When **Heaven’s aid** arrives,*\n*The distant wilds pay tribute,*\n*The **Mysterious Teaching*** dispels confusion.\n*Sitting in court, he listens with grace,*\n*In leisure, he accompanies **Red Pine**,*\n*Discussing **rare and lofty** matters.*\n\n*Exceeding even the swiftest steeds,*\n*He turns to ask humanity of **one degree**—*\n*Beyond the mortal realm, he returns to **emptiness**.*\"\n\nThe emperor, upon reading it, rejoiced greatly,\nAnd at twilight, spoke of his return.\n\nThe following day, the imperial envoy presented a tray of peaches. The Master had abstained from tea and fruit for over ten years, yet out of the emperor’s boundless grace, he reluctantly ate one.\n\nBy the Mid-Autumn Festival, he received the edict to return to the mountains, and was further granted ten thousand strings of cash, which he respectfully declined.\n\nIn the year *Jiǎyǒu*, the second month, the imperial carriage departed from Yàn Tái. Upon reaching the *Guān Shǎn* region, news of the emperor’s passing arrived. The Master sighed and said: *\"Alas! The great matter of life and death—though one holds the highest rank, possesses all under Heaven, yet cannot escape the hundred years’ span. How is this possible?\"* Thus, he resolved to return westward.\n\nCrossing *Hán Gǔ Pass*, passing through *Zhōngnán Mountains*, he traveled according to local customs, spreading the *Mysterious Teaching*, which flourished wherever he went.\n\nWhen the era was renamed *Míngchāng*, he returned eastward to the seaside, taking refuge at Qíxiá, where he constructed altars and halls.\n\nBy the year *Wùchén*, his reputation soared, his name known throughout the land. The emperor honored him, renaming his abode *Tàixū Guān* and bestowing six thousand volumes of *Xuándū Bǎozàng* as perpetual offerings.\n\nNot long after, war raged across the *Héshuò* frontier. Envoys from Sòng and Jin, each bearing imperial decrees, arrived simultaneously. The Great Mongols of the northern lands also sent *Liú Zhònglù* with their own proclamation. All assumed the Master would journey south, for the southern lands revered the *Way* deeply, while the north was steeped in slaughter—besides, the languages were incomprehensible.\n\nYet the Master said nothing. He selected eighteen disciples worthy of the journey and, with *Liú Zhònglù*, set westward.\n\nPassing through *Jì*, reaching *Déyù Fǔ*, he lodged at *Lóngyáng Guān*. He sent a poem to his friends in Yànjīng:\n\n*\"Ten years of war and fire bring sorrow to the people,*\n*Yet scarcely one or two survive a thousand.*\n*Last year, by fortune, I received the merciful edict,*\n*This spring, I must brave the cold to depart.*\n*I do not shun the three thousand *lǐ* of northern peaks,*\n*Yet still I ponder the two hundred eastern prefectures.*\n*In dire straits, the condemned gasp for breath—*\n*Let me teach them how to ease their woes.\"*\n\nCrossing the *Bái Gǔ Tián*, where cold winds and piled snow bit into the bones, he endured countless hardships. He composed a long poem in ancient style to record their journey:\n\n*\"East of Jīnshān, west of Yīnshān,*\n*Ten thousand cliffs and gorges pierce the deep ravines.*\n*Chaotic rocks block the path beyond,*\n*No wheel or hoof has ever passed since ancient times.*\n*Two years past, the Second Prince raised armies,*\n*Built bridges to span the rushing waters.*\n*Now my *Way* seeks to journey westward,*\n*Again the clamor of chariots and horses passes here.*\n*Silver peaks, iron walls rise ten thousandfold,*\n*Each vying in grandeur, boasting of their might.*\n*When the sun rises, the sea below seems near,*\n*When the moon shines, it connects with the Milky Way.*\n*Heaven-piercing pines stand straight as writing brushes,*\n*Towering, swaying—over a hundred *zhàng* tall.*\n*Ten thousand stalks lean close, dark and dense,*\n*Yet not a crow caws—only empty silence.*\n*The winding *Yángqiāng* presses *Mèngmén* against *Tàiháng*,\n*Yet this mountain’s grandeur is still but commonplace.*\n*Double chariots climb and descend with labored steps,*\n*Hundreds of horsemen before and behind, all in alarm.*\n*The *Tiānchí* sea lies atop the mountain,*\n*A hundred *lǐ* mirroring the boundless world.*\n*Cars halt, horses descend the western slope,*\n*Forty-eight bridges stretch low over ten thousand *zhàng*.*\n*From the southern river to the northern sea, the mountains are endless,*\n*In endless change, their forms remain the same.*\n*Yet none compare to this mountain’s supreme oddity—*\n*Its rugged, towering peaks seem wrought by divine craft.*\n*When I arrived, it was the eighth or ninth month,*\n*Yet half the mountain was already snow.*\n*Before the mountain, grass and trees warm as spring,*\n*Behind it, my robes stiffen like iron.*\n*Westward, I traveled ten thousand *lǐ*—*\n*The mountains, rivers, strange men, and marvelous beasts*\n*I saw were far different from those of the Central Kingdom.*\n\nAt that time, *Chéngjísī* the Emperor still held *Suàn Dān*, not yet descending. The envoy *Liú Zhònglù* presented the Master to him. The Emperor greeted him warmly: *\"Other kingdoms’ summons go unanswered, yet you have crossed ten thousand *lǐ* to come here. I greatly honor this.\"*\n\nThe Master replied: *\"The mountains and wilderness rise in response to the imperial edict—this is the will of Heaven, not the work of man.\"*\n\nThe Emperor offered him food. After eating, he asked: *\"Master, having traveled so far, do you possess any elixir of longevity to bestow upon me?\"*\n\nThe Master said: *\"I have only the *Way* of preserving life, not an elixir of immortality.\"*\n\nThe Emperor admired his sincerity. From then on, he summoned the Master daily, urging him to reduce slaughter and curb desires. Their conversations spanned thousands of words. *Yēlǜ Jìnqīng*, then a minister, recorded them in *Xuānfēng Qìnghuì Lù*. The Emperor believed and followed them all.\n\nThe Emperor asked *Zhèn Hǎi*: *\"By what title should the Master be addressed?\"*\n\n*Zhèn Hǎi* replied: *\"Some honor him as *Fùshī*, others as *Zhēnrén*, still others as *Shénxiān*.\"*\n\nThe Emperor decreed: *\"From this day forward, let him be called *Shénxiān*.\"*\n\nIn the spring of *Guǐwǔ*, at the emperor’s command, he was escorted back to Yànjīng by thousands of armored cavalry. *Tiāncháng Guān* was renamed *Chángchūn Gōng*, and *Báiyún Guān* was rebuilt, merging them into one. The *Nán Gōng Wànsuì Shān* and *Tàiyè Chí* were also granted to him, renamed *Wàn’ān Gōng*. The edict commanded all virtuous recluses in the land to join him, and he was given a *jīnhǔ fú* seal to act as he saw fit. Over time, he received countless imperial decrees.\n\nThe Master, now overseeing *Chángchūn Gōng*, saw the *Quánzhēn Way* flourish. Leading rituals to invoke winds and rain, his predictions never failed—like echoes and shadows. Ten thousand households turned to him.\n\nIn his leisure, after the noon repast, he would ride with a few attendants to *Wàn’ān Gōng*, enjoying the wealth of *Cāoshān Xī*, the evening rest of joyful birds and fish. He visited daily, returning only as dusk fell.\n\nIn the sixth month of the year *Dīnghài*, on the twenty-third day, he fell ill and did not leave his quarters. When messengers inquired at the *wǔ* hour, a sudden storm erupted. The southern bank of *Tàiyè Chí* collapsed, flooding into the *Dōng Hú*, its roar heard for tens of *lǐ*. The *diàn’áo yúguī* vanished, and the pool dried up. The northern cliff of the mountain crumbled on its own.\n\nThe Master, upon hearing this, laughed and said: *\"The mountain crumbles, the pool dries—shall I depart with them?\"*\n\nOn the fourth day of the seventh month, the Master told his disciples: *\"Long ago, Dan Yang once foretold to me: 'After my passing, the Dao will flourish greatly, and the four quarters will transform into Daoic lands. You shall be there at that time, presiding over the great observatories, all bestowed with official titles and seals, with envoys bearing symbols and riding in official carriages. This is the moment when one’s merit is complete, one’s name established, and it is time to rest in retirement.' Dan Yang’s words have all come true—I return with no regrets.\"*\n\nHaving declared his illness, on the ninth day, just after noon, he ascended to the *Bǎoxuān Táng* and left behind this verse:\n\n*\"Life and death are but morning and evening—\nA fleeting bubble, a laborer in the river’s flow.\nWhere faint light flickers, the hare and tortoise leap,\nWhen profound measure opens, mountains and seas are embraced.\nStrumming the eight strings as though within arm’s reach,\nBlowing the void into forms like a mechanism’s play.\nMad verses spill like dust beneath the pen,\nLeft for the age to mock and question in vain.\"*\n\nHe then returned to the *Bǎoguāng Táng*, where he transformed with vibrant grace—like a butterfly emerging.\n\nAt that moment, a *qīngluán* crane and a white heron circled above and below, auspicious vapors filled the air, and celestial melodies swirled before he ascended into the sky. Officials and commoners alike knelt in reverence, and his remains were enshrined in the *Shùn Táng* of the *Báiyún Guàn*.\n\nThree years later, when his coffin was opened, his robes were found unchanged, his limbs soft as silk, his complexion as if alive. All his works—songs, essays, letters, treatises, plain speech, and recorded sayings—collected as *Mófēixī Jí*, *Wūdào Jí*, and *Xīyóu Jì*, numbering thousands—circulated in the world.\n\nThe *Xuěfēng* eulogy reads:\n\n*\"The heavens and earth as hall and chamber,\nThe sun and moon as lamps and candles.\nAn old immortal of the *Lóuxiá* peak,\nRising and setting within the *Zhōngsù* hostel.\nBefore the assembly, he spoke of Heaven’s ways,\nHis words like ice and jade in flight.\nUnlocking the Dao’s subtle mechanisms,\nHe silently enjoyed the lofty celestial rewards.\nHis divine refinement—how pure and clear,\nHis radiance dazzling both eyes.\nHis rising form—how light and swift,\nHealthy winds stirring his sturdy feet.\nThe Dao flourishes or fades,\nYet all hearts bow in submission.\nThe Golden Elixir—finished or not,\nWhite clouds fill the valleys and peaks.\"*\n\nThe eulogy continues:\n\n*\"I once visited the *Yāntái*, where three men debated the merits of Master Qiu Xian of the Yellow Peak. One said: 'I say his greatest virtue was seven years of toil at Fǎnshuǐ Xi, and years of radiance in the *Bǎoxuān Táng*, laying the foundation for refining the Golden Elixir and planting the Fire Plum and Exchange Pear trees. He entered dreams as spirit, turned earth and heaven—this was his greatest virtue.'\n\nAnother replied: 'No. I say his greatest virtue was establishing observatories, teaching and guiding people, opening the full-bloom lotus of the *Quánzhēn*, and planting the shadowless three-flowered tree. Half the world wore the official cap, and all spoke of the Dao in leisure—none failed to drink from the *Chóngxuān*, all were touched by the utmost transformation. This was his greatest virtue.'\n\nThe third said: 'Both of you see only the small, grasp only the partial. You take half a fist of *Tàishān* and a leaf from *Děnglín*—you miss the whole.\n\nI say: When the Mongol armies swept south, their horses drank the Yellow River nearly dry, their arrows made *Huàyuè* tremble, and both precious and base were burned, the wise and foolish slaughtered. Corpses piled like mountains, blood like seas—thunderous might, merciless as a tiger. Fortunately, Master Chángchūn Qiu Xian arose at the emperor’s summons. With one audience, the dragon’s wrath eased; with a second, Heaven’s will turned. Those who surrendered were spared, cities that fell were pardoned, conscripts were ransomed, captives set free. Four hundred districts gained peace, tens of thousands of miles received grace. He stretched his arms to block the collapsing peaks, lay his body to dam the flooding river—saving lives from the boiling cauldron, snatching souls from the executioner’s blade. The saved numbered in the hundreds of millions, surpassing even the sacrifices of *Mòtǎn* and *Jīnggāi*.\n\nSuch hidden merit ascends to Heaven’s will—why seek the nine-refined cinnabar or seven-returned elixir?'\"*\n\nZhang Shén’tóng’s poem reads:\n*\"Refining Han’s nine-returned cinnabar,\nFirst in Dao and letters—\nThe Three Isles await his departure,\nTo this day, cranes and herons call at *Qíxiá*.\"*\n\n---\n**Excerpt from *Jīnlián Zhōngzōng Jì Chūn zhī sìjìng* and *Jīnlián Zhōngzōng Jì juàn zhī wǔ***\n\nThe forest-dwelling Feathered Guest and the Pine-River Hermit compiled this—\n**Master Wáng Zhēnyán** of Jade-Sun.\n\nHis given name was Chǔyī, and he was called **Yùyáng Zǐ**—Wáng was his surname, and his home was in Shùmǔ of Nínghǎi.\n\nAs a child, he lost his father and served his mother with utmost filial piety.\nHis stature was towering and robust;\neven as a youth, he did not indulge in frivolous play,\npreferring instead to recite verses of the Clouds-and-Mists Beyond.\n\nAt seven years old, he met **Shùhuá Jiàozhǔ**,\nwho taught him the secrets of **Eternal Life and Longevity**.\n\nAt fourteen, while wandering in the mountains,\nhe encountered an aged man seated upon a flat rock.\nThe old man beckoned him forward,\nstroked his forehead, and said:\n*\"On the morrow, thou shalt rise to fame at the Celestial Gate,\nand shall become the Great Master of the Mysterious Dao.\"*\n\nHaving spoken thus, the old man stood,\ndragged his staff, and walked away.\nThe Master followed without ceasing,\nand asked:\n*\"Who are you, sir?\"*\n\nThe old man replied:\n*\"I am the Master of the **Mysterious Court**.\"*\n\nThen he turned his head—\nand vanished without trace.\nFrom that day onward,\nthe Master’s speech grew unrestrained and wild,\nno longer in harmony with the world,\nhis movements erratic and unhinged.\n\nThe Master arrived in **Dàdìng** during the second month of Spring in the **Year of the Monkey** [大定春二月中]. On a leisurely day, he visited **Fàn Míngshū’s** *Encountering the Immortal Pavilion* [遇仙亭] and there saw **Master Zhòngyáng of Zhōngnán Shān** [终南山重阳祖师].\n\nThe Master observed his extraordinary bone structure and frame [骨格非凡], and asked:\n*\"Would you allow me, humble one, to follow you?\"*\nThe Master replied:\n*\"This is my deepest wish—how could I dare refuse your command?\"* [仆所愿也，敢不唯命]\n\nThus, he served at the Master’s side,\nand with **Qiū Zhēnren**, **Liú Zhēnren**, **Tán Zhēnren**, and **Mǎ Zhēnren**,\nthey became **unfailing friends** [莫逆之交].\nIn their pursuit of **Daoist refinement and hidden precepts** [修真秘诀],\nthey exhausted every inquiry without restraint.\n\nThe Master called him and said:\n*\"The **Yún Guāng Cave** [云光洞] in **Tiěchá Mountain** [铁查山], **Wéndēng County** [文登县],\nis where you shall ascend to **perfect Dao** [登真].\nYou may dwell there—do not slacken in your efforts.\nAs for your **Dao-name** [道号] and **surname** [名号],\nI shall bestow them upon you in time.\"*\n\nThe Master then bowed and took his leave,\nretiring into the cave.\n\nIn the fourth month,\nwhen the Master was about to journey to **Lóngquán** [龙泉],\nhe borrowed **Fàn Míngshū’s parasol** [借范明叔伞] to shield himself from the sun.\n**Qiū**, **Liú**, **Tán**, and **Mǎ** went ahead,\nwhile the Master lingered half a *lǐ* behind [可半里许].\nSuddenly, he cast the parasol into the air—\nit drifted aloft toward the **west-north** [西北],\nsoaring away without trace.\n\n**Qiū** and **Liú** were startled,\nturning back to ask where it had gone.\nThe Master said:\n*\"I rode the **Exalted Whirlwind** [搏扶摇] upward—\nI know not how it came to pass.\"*\n\nFrom the **hour of the Chicken** [自辰] to the **hour of the Dog** [至哺],\nthe parasol fell before the **Yún Guāng Cave** [云光洞],\nshattering its handle.\nWithin it was inscribed a **Dao-name** [道号]:\n*\"Jièyáng Zǐ\"* [介阳子], with the surname *\"Chǔyī\"* [处一].\n*\"Jiè\"* sounds like *\"zhú\"* (bamboo), yet no bamboo character exists in the **Middle Pinyin** [篇韵中本],\nfor the Master had composed it himself.\nThe surname *\"Chǔyī\"* was written as *\"七\"* (seven),\nsymbolizing the **seven golden lotuses** [金莲七朵].\n\nApproximately, the place where the parasol was cast\nwas **two hundred lǐ** distant from the **Yún Guāng Cave** [云光洞].\n\nThe Master received it,\nand later returned to thank him.\nThe Master bestowed upon him a verse:\n*\"Refinement’s principles are marked with utmost care [修行事理记丁宁],\nYet only a tranquil mind brings clarity [只要心中静裹明].\nWhen the eye’s vision ceases, dragons dwell within [眼界不生龙自住],\nAnd when the nostrils close not, tigers rest [鼻门无闭虎常停].\nWithdrawing taste from the tongue, the spirit brightens [舌根退味心神爽],\nAnd silencing sound in the ears, the **kidney’s vital water** [肾水] clears.\nNorth and south merge into unity [南北混融归一处],\nWhile **Dao-qi** of the **East and West** [束西交媾] extinguishes the **Three Pāngs** [灭三彭].\nWood and metal blend in harmonious stillness [木金厮枚盘桓住],\nAnd the **Yīnglǎo** [婴姥] follows in effortless ease [自在行].\nThe **Golden Elixir** [金丹] is forged at the crown of the head,\nIts **five radiant lights** [五光] piercing through the **rainbow canopy** [彩云棚].\"*\n\nThe Master bowed and accepted it.\nFrom then on,\nhe traveled between **Dēngzhou** [登州] and **Nínghǎi** [宁海],\nreturning each night to the **Yún Guāng Cave** [云光洞].\nFor **nine years**, he stood alone,\nhoisting one foot in the air [偏翘一足独立].\nFacing the **great eastern sea** [东临大海],\nhe never once dozed off—\nmen called him the **Iron-Foot Master** [铁脚先生].\n\n**Qiū Zhēnren** praised him thus:\n*\"In summer, he greets the sun standing upright [九夏迎阳立],\nAnd in winter, he embraces the snow in slumber [三冬抱雪眠].\nAfter nine years of such **body refinement** [炼形],\nhe entered **Great Miracle** [大妙],\nMoving forward and backward with ease,\nSometimes singing, sometimes dancing,\nAscending to the **spirit realm** [出神入梦],\nAnd benefiting all beings he encountered [接物利生].\"*\n\nIn the **Year of the Monkey** [大定戊申岁],\nthe **World Sovereign** [世宗] heard his **Dao-worth** [道价] was high,\nand sent envoys with offerings to invite him.\nThus, he went to the **Celestial Gate** [赴阙].\n\nThe **monks** [僧徒] harbored resentment and envy,\nmany bribing the imperial attendants [多输金於中使],\nclaiming the Master was no true immortal,\nand that **poisoned wine** [鸩酒] could expose him.\nThe Sovereign agreed,\nand granted him **three cups** [赐之三杯].\nThe Master drank them,\nyet felt no disturbance or agitation—\nthe poisoners could not harm him.\n\nThe Sovereign was astonished and apologized,\nbestowing upon him a **golden crown** [金冠] and **Daoist robes** [法服],\na **four-horse carriage** [驷马安车],\nand ordering the construction of a **Perfect Dao Hall** [全真堂] for his residence,\neven inscribing the plaque himself [仍御书额].\n\nIn the **Year of the Rat** [己酉岁], five days after **Qīngmíng Festival** [清明],\nhe received imperial decree to return to his mountain home [还故山],\nand was again granted **vast wealth in gold and silk** [金帛巨万].\nHe declined with a **tablet of thanks** [表而辞之].\n\nIn the **third year of Chéng’ān** [承安三年秋八月],\n**Emperor Zhāng** [章宗] summoned him to the capital,\nhonoring him in the **Convenience Hall** [便殿].\nHis responses flowed effortlessly,\nand the Emperor was deeply pleased,\nurging him to accept the title **Tǐxiān Dàshī** [体玄大师],\nand to reside in a newly built **Refinement Observatory** [修真观].\n\nIn the **Year of the Pig** [泰和壬戌岁],\nhe journeyed to **Bózhōu** [亳州], the **Tàiqīng Palace** [太清宫],\nto oversee the **Universal Dao Ritual** [普天醮事].\nTen thousand **cranes soared** [万鹤翱翔],\nand the **Highest Sovereign** [太上] manifested in the clouds,\nhis face glowing like the sun [面赭於日].\nThe Master composed a verse:\n*\"Divine influence spreads from the **Dao-realm** [洞天],\nAnd golden gates perform teachings without bound [金门演教庆无边].\nThe **Yùyáng Zǐ of the East** [东方云海玉阳子],\nDistinctly receives imperial grace—\nthe **fourth proclamation** [第四宣].\"*\n\nAfterward, he returned to the **Yún Guāng Cave** [云光洞],\nand **initiated over a thousand Daoists** [度道士者千余众].\n\nIn **Dōngmóu** [东牟],\nthere was a man named **Chí Jīn** [迟金],\na wealthy household [豪家],\nwho treated the Master with great generosity [待师甚厚].\nOne day, he fell ill with a sudden **wind evil** [冒风邪],\nand though a hundred physicians [百医] could not cure him,\nhe did not recover.\n\nThe Master pitied him,\nand commanded that **fifty green fish** [青鱼五十尾] be cooked,\nwrapped in cakes for him to consume [以饼卷而餐之].\nAfter eating his fill,\nhe rose and walked with swiftness—\nall in the region were astounded,\nand followed his example by seeking transformation.\n\nThe Master begged for food in **Fúshān County, Dēngzhou** [福山县],\nwhere he saw **Pān Shānrén** [潘山人] had died and was being prepared for burial [身殁将葬].\nHe gathered the man’s ears with his hands,\nand with a loud voice declared:\n*\"The **Underworld** [地府] cannot take you!\"*\nIn an instant, the man revived,\neating and drinking as before.\n\nHis son offered many riches in gratitude [多以财货谢之],\nbut the Master only smiled faintly,\nwaved his sleeve, and departed.\nWhile in **Nínghǎi** [宁海],\ntwo **malefactors** [二凶徒] sought to harm him,\neach holding a staff to invite him to drink [各持杖邀师同饮].\nWhen he was nearly drunk,\nthey planned to strike him together [俟醉而共加捶焉].\nYet before they could act,\nthe two men **struck each other** [自相欧击],\none dying from the blow.\n\nThe onlookers were terrified,\nassuming the Master would surely suffer retribution,\nwith no means of escape.\nBut the Master cried out in a great voice:\n*\"The **East Peak** [东岳] cannot take you!\"*\nIn an instant, they recovered,\nand the crowd’s worries dissolved.\n\nAs he passed through **Jìyáng County** [济阳县],\nmany sought his **Dao-law** [法名],\nand by the **third watch** [将及三鼓],\nthe Master dipped his brush in ink and wrote:\n*\"Thieves\"** [贼人].\nThen with a stern voice, he declared:\n*\"There are thieves!\"*\nAll rushed out the door,\nand saw several armed men,\nwho fled in panic—\nnone knew their fate.\n\nBefore the **Shèngshuǐ Cave** [圣水洞] stood a massive stone,\njutting out several *zhàng* in length [斜出可数丈许].\nTravelers often feared it,\nand the crowd proposed removing it.\nHammers and chisels were employed,\nyet after many days, only a fraction was broken [击毁百分未及其一].\nThe Master laughed and approached,\nraising his hammer three times—\nits sound like thunder [士尸若雷霆],\nand the stone collapsed.\nA **purple mist** [紫烟] enveloped the cliffs and valleys,\ndispersing only after three days.\n\n「In the year of **Bingwu** [丙午] of the **Dàdìng** era [大定丙午岁],\non the day of the **Chóngyáng** descent [重阳降迹],\nat the appointed hour of **Fēigǔ** in **Dānyáng** [丹阳飞骨之期],\nthe Master proceeded to **Lángyá Village** [琅琊村],\nwhere he enticed and transformed the fishermen into abandoning their nets and fishing gear [诱化船户尽焚鱼网],\nthus inspiring the **marvelous phenomena** [海市] to manifest in the southeast [感海市现於东南],\nwith lofty towers and verdant hills,\npalaces adorned like pearls—\nwonderous sights that astonished five counties [重楼翠阜，具阙珠宫，惊骇数郡].\n\nHe then borrowed the **rhyme and meter** [韵] of **Dōngpō** [东坡] to compose a single poem, the full text of which is not recorded here [因借东坡韵书一篇，文多不载].\nIncluding his miracles such as\npraying to the **Dragon** [龙] and receiving rain [祷龙即雨],\nboiling a chicken and its return to life [烹鸡复还],\npouring wine into a leaky vessel and it not spilling [漏瓶注酒],\nor reviving withered branches [枯极生枝],\nall of which are too numerous to recount [不可备录].\n\nBy the time of the **Zhēnyòu** era [真佑], in the year of **Dīngchǒu** [丁丑], on the twenty-third day of the fourth month [四月二十三日],\na **five-colored cloud** [五色云] arose from the southeast,\nand two **green-clad attendants** [二青衣] bore a decree [捧诏] down upon him,\nwhile banners and flags obscured the sky [旌幢蔽天],\nand all gazed upon the spectacle in reverence [众皆瞻礼].\n\nThe Master told his disciples:\n*\"The saints have already arrived within the past three days\"* [三日已前，众圣皆至].\nAfter speaking, he burned incense to pay homage in all directions [朝礼十方],\nthen took up his brush and inscribed a **hymn of praise** [颂]:\n*\"Leaping forth from the **Heavenly Sovereign’s** [乾坤] creative authority,\nthe divine radiance shines resplendent across all realms [造化权，神光晃朗遍诸天].\nLoftily ascending in a **crane’s carriage** [鹤驭], transcending the **Three Realms** [三界],\njoyfully receiving the **Golden Book** [金书] and **Jade Emperor’s** [玉帝] proclamation [喜受金书玉帝宣].\nWith the stroke of his pen, he lay down and slept,\nand suddenly returned to his **true form** [奄然返真],\nhis **auspicious light** [祥光] filling the mountains and valleys,\nhis **lucky qi** [瑞气] enveloping the rivers and plains,\nremaining for several days before dispersing [数日不散].\n\nThe poems he composed in his lifetime number nearly a thousand [平生所集歌诗近千余首],\nwhich he titled *Qīngzhēn Collection* [《清真集》] and *Lěimǎiguāng Collection* [《蕾买光集》],\nboth widely circulated in the world [盛行於世].\n\nThe **eulogy** [赞] reads:\n*\"Refining essence into **Jade Elixir** [玉阳], concealing light within **Sacred Water** [圣水],\na **bamboo parasol** [竹伞] held in his hand—\nthe **name** [名号] secretly transmitted within its grasp [柠砾],\nbeneath **Iron Rod Mountain** [铁查山], many **practices** [工夫] were performed [多做].\nThrough three winters, he embraced the snow in tranquil repose [三冬抱雪以安眠],\nand in nine summers, he welcomed the sun to stand firm [九夏迎阳而坤立].\nThus, he could harmonize the **Southern and Northern** [南北] into a single **Dao** [归一处],\nand reconcile the **Eastern and Western** [东西] to extinguish the **Three Pèngs** [灭三彭].\nHe was repeatedly spoken of by **Daoist Immortals** [仙圣] and **saints** [传言],\nand four times received imperial decrees [四感帝王之降诏].\nHe drank **poisoned wine** [鸩酒] yet his **luster** [容光] remained unaltered,\nand when the fishermen’s nets were burned, the **marvelous phenomena** [海市] surged across the sky [横空].\nThough **Pan Gong** [潘公] had already passed away [已死],\nhe was revived by the **three shouts** [三喝]—\nand though he had long been **paralyzed** [久瘫],\nhe was granted **one elixir** [一养] and rose again [再起].\n\nA **child disciple** [童子] emerged from the furnace [炉内],\nwhile **Lǎojūn** [老君] manifested in the clouds above [高显於云端].\nWith his hand raised, wielding an **iron hammer** [铁锤],\nthe great stone had already been heard crashing into the ravine [巨石已闻於落涧],\nand with his mouth transmitting the **Jade Precepts** [玉诀],\nthe mountains trembled in response [群山竟见於摇峰].\nWithout roots, the branches and leaves regenerated [无根根上枝叶重生],\nand in the bottomless vessel, the wine flowed endlessly without leakage [没底壶中酒嘐不漏].\nThe **crane descended** [鹤降] and danced repeatedly before the altar [屡舞],\nwhile the **boiled chicken** [鸡烹] was heard crowing again on its perch [架上重呜].\nThe **thieves**, wielding their weapons, turned to leisurely wandering [反逍],\nand the **malevolent**, raising their clubs, fell into their own traps [自欧].\nLeaping forth from the **Heavenly Sovereign’s** [乾坤] creative authority,\nhe manipulated the **mechanisms of sun and moon** [斡回日月之机关].\n\nUnder his **platform** [席下], disciples numbered in the thousands [数千百众],\nwhile those he personally guided amounted to hundreds [亲度者].\nHis **lifetime techniques** [手段]—\nthose shared by his followers—totaled thirty-six [共传者三十六端].\nThus, he could receive the **Jade Emperor’s** [玉帝] proclamation,\nand attend the **Golden Lotus Assembly** [金莲之会].\n\n**Zhāng Shéntóng** [张神童] composed a poem:\n*\"His fame was so high that he once received imperial proclamation,\nsensing the **Golden Book** [金书] granted to embody the **Mystic Dao** [体玄].\nHaving perfected **Daoist virtue** [道德] and transformed his **Divine Form**

**Línjiān Yùkè** [林间羽客] and **Línjiān Zhāliè Dàorén** [柠砾道人].」\n\n**Hè Zhēnrén of Guǎngníng** [郝真人]—\nMaster surnamed **Hè** [郝], given name **Lǐn** [璘], styled **Tiánrán Zǐ** [恬然子], and self-named **Tàigǔ Dàorén** [太古道人].\nHis ancestral home was **Nínghǎi** [宁海], where his family had long practiced the **Daoist Way of Wandering and Officialdom** [游宦].\nMaster **Hè** was the younger brother of **Zhāng Liè** [张列], who served in the imperial court.\nHe was deeply filial to his mother, possessed a rich and graceful nature, and held no ambition for worldly honors or official rank.\nHe delved deeply into the **divinatory arts** [卜筮之数], and never let go of the **Yellow Old** [黄老] and **Zhuangzi’s** [庄] teachings.\n\nWhenever he encountered secluded groves and quiet streams, he would linger there, forgetting the return home until day’s end.\nIn the autumn of **Dīnghài** [丁亥, 1167] in the **Dàdìng** [大定] era, he sold divinations in the marketplace,\nwhile scholars and officials gathered around him in attendance.\n**Zhòngyáng** [重阳] arrived last, sitting with his back turned.\nMaster **Hè** said, *\"Why not turn around?\"*\n**Zhòngyáng** replied, *\"I fear you would not turn around.\"*\nMaster **Hè** was startled and quickly rose to pay respects,\nthen invited **Zhòngyáng** to another place for leisurely conversation.\nTheir exchanges flowed like stones dropped into water—\nquick, resonant, and profound.\nMaster **Hè** presented a poem:\n*\"The gentlemen at my side delight in the **Way of Tàigǔ** [太古],\nyet they still seek the **Unseen Path of Black and White** [黑白希夷路].\nToday, I meet a **Daoist Sage** [达人] who sings of it—\nI humbly await your **Jade Words** [玉句] to enlighten me.\"*\n\n**Zhòngyáng** responded:\n*\"I praise **Master Hè** for his mastery of ancient lore,\nand speak of the **Path of the Divine Martial** [神仙路].\nHis feet ask of the **Emerald Mists** [翠雾] that greet him in coming days,\nwhile I urge him to embrace the **Sage’s Stillness** [清静句].\"\n\nMaster **Hè** read this, filled with joy, and returned home.\n\nThe following year, in the **Wùzǐ** [戊子, 1168] era, during the third month,\nhe went alone to **Kūnjiàn Mountain’s** [昆箭山] **Yānyán Cave** [烟霞洞],\nburning incense in reverence and humbly offering his services.\n**Zhòngyáng** bestowed upon him the **Daoist name** [法名] **\"Dàtōng\"** [大通],\nstyled him **Guǎngníng Zǐ** [广宁子], and placed him among **Qiū** [丘], **Liú** [刘], **Tán** [谭], and **Mǎ** [马]\nto serve at his side.\n\nBy the seventh month, **Zhòngyáng** ordered all his disciples to return to **Nínghǎi** [宁海],\nleaving only **Qiū** [丘] at his side.\nAfter a few days, **Zhòngyáng** sent **Qiū** [丘] to summon **Master Hè** [太古].\nWhen he arrived, **Zhòngyáng** said,\n*\"I have cut the sleeves of my robe in two—\nI need them to patch my back,\nso you may wear them for winter.\nI will mend my own sleeves afterward.\"*\nMaster **Hè** bowed in acceptance—\na **symbol of the ancient transmission of the robe** [传衣之法].\n\nAfter this, **Zhòngyáng** returned south to **Biànliáng** [汴梁],\nwhile Master **Hè** traveled between **Héběi** [河北].\nIn the **Yǐwèi** [乙未, 1175] era, he begged for food in **Wò State** [沃州],\nwhen he suddenly understood **Zhòngyáng’s** hidden words,\nand his mind opened like water released from a dam.\nHe then sat silently on a bridge,\nneither seeking food nor complaining of hunger or cold,\naccepting alms only when offered,\nand enduring insults without anger—\nhis resolve was to **forget the form** [忘形].\nThus, for three years, people called him **Silent Master** [不语先生].\n\nOne night, the sky darkened, and a drunken passerby,\nmistaking his stillness for weakness,\nkicked Master **Hè** into the river below the bridge.\nHe remained motionless for seven days,\nand none knew where he had gone.\nA traveler’s horse suddenly reared and refused to move forward,\nthough he beat it relentlessly.\nThe traveler dismounted and asked his attendants,\n*\"There must be some strange matter beneath this bridge—\notherwise, why would my horse be so alarmed?\"*\nHe ordered them to investigate,\nand they found a **Daoist** [道者] sitting quietly in the darkness.\nWhen questioned, he did not speak,\nbut traced the earth with his hand and said,\n*\"I have not eaten for seven days.\"*\nThe townsfolk heard this,\nrushed to offer him food,\nand begged him to emerge.\nYet he only shook his head in refusal,\nand sat there another three years—\n**water and fire inverted** [水火颠倒], **yin and yang harmonized** [阴阳和合].\nHis **Nine Transformations** [九转] were complete.\n\nThen, he rose and departed,\nhis staff and sandals striking northward,\nlingering in **Zhēndìng** [真定] and its environs,\nwhere countless seekers came to learn from him.\nHe established **Daoist halls** [宫观] and ascended the platform to guide disciples,\nand the **Mystic Dao** [玄风] flourished anew.\nHe displayed the **Sutra of Awakening in the South Grove** [《悟南柯》] to the assembly:\n*\"Earth’s lungs, **Zhòngyáng** [重阳],\n**Kūnjiàn’s** [昆箭] **Tàigǔ Sage** [太古仙],\nthe two of us bound in **pre-birth vow** [结约未生前].\nWe descended from **Great Luo Heaven** [大罗天],\ndwelling in the mundane world,\nto expound the **Teachings of the Mystic Origin** [玄元教].\nOur **hidden and revealed deeds** [行藏] were marked by **green jade** [有绿],\nyet how could we fail to awaken like flowing waters?\nAfter parting, we met again—\nand swore to reunite in a thousand years.\"*\n\nSince the **Míngchāng** [明昌] era,\nhe returned to **Shù State** [束州] and built a separate **Daoist retreat** [琳宇],\nwhere he guided many disciples.\nThree years before his passing,\nhe ordered craftsmen to carve an **Earthly Tomb** [地宫] for him,\nlining it with **jade** [璧],\nand would rest there daily,\ntelling them,\n*\"On the thirty-first day of the twelfth month, I shall depart.\"*\nFor three years, his **Daoist essence** [法体] remained robust.\nTo his disciples, he said,\n*\"My Master truly has a **vow with Penglai** [蓬莱之约],\nand now I return to him.\"*\nWith these words, he **discarded the external to return to the true** [外而返真],\njust as the **thirty-first day of the twelfth month** arrived.\nHe lived to eighty-four years of age.\n\nThroughout his life, he **sang hymns of praise** [歌颂],\ndeeply understanding the **sayings of Inverted Dragon and Tiger** [龙虎颠倒],\nand the **cyclical rise and fall of the hexagrams and lines** [卦爻升降].\nHis works were called *The **Tàigǔ Collection*** [《太古集》],\nand they spread widely in the world.\n\n**Eulogy:**\n*\"The **Guǎngníng Daoist** [广宁道人] exhaustively explored the **symbols of the *Yì*** [《易》].\nHe despised the **coarse mien of the age** [俗态],\nabandoning wife and children in an instant,\nand sought the **Mystic Dao** [玄风],\ndelighting to receive the **Daoist cap** [簪冠].\nHe **returned and hid** [归、隐] in the **Yānyán Cave** [烟霞洞],\nand **reverently paid homage** [恭礼] beneath **Zhòngyáng’s** platform.\nThrough **diligent practice** [工夫], he **turned his essence** [展转],\nand **employed his techniques** [手段] with mastery.\nHe **proclaimed the essence of Tàigǔ** [太古之精华],\nand **absorbed the marrow of the Full Perfection Dao** [全真之骨髓].\nHe **aligned with the tortoise and serpent** [按龟蛇],\nand **swirled the Dragon and Tiger** [运龙虎].\nIn **Nínghǎi’s** marketplace, he **secretly grasped the robe’s transmission** [暗得传衣之妙],\nand beneath **Wò State’s** bridge, he **steadfastly held to the alchemical refinement of qi** [坚持炼气之功].\nHe **observed the body from beyond the body** [身外观身],\nand **settled

harmonized** [铅汞调和],\nthe **Nine Transformations’ Elixir** [九转丹] naturally formed,\nand the **Three Treasures’ Fruit** [三华果] ripened.\nHe fulfilled his **preordained vow with Penglai** [蓬壶之旧约],\nand **foretold the month of his departure** [预占腊月之尽期].\nIf not for one who **dwells in the world yet communicates with the unseen** [迹寄人问，心通象外],\nwho could attain such heights?\"\n\n**Zhāng Shéntóng** [张神童] composed a poem:\n*\"In the marketplace or on the mountain, he follows **Nature** [自然].\nWithin stillness, he **penetrates the Mystic *Yì*** [易中玄].\nNow, he drinks beyond **Penglai’s** heights,\nand through the ages, **Tàigǔ’s** **Sage** [太古仙] is passed down.\"*\n\n**Fifth Volume of the *Golden Lotus Orthodox Lineage*** [金莲正宗记卷之五],\ncompiled by **Línjiān Yùkè** [林间羽客] and **Línjiān Zhāliè Dàorén** [柠砾道人].\n\n**The Daoist Maiden of Pure Quietness** [清静散人], surnamed **Xiāngū** [仙姑], was the youngest daughter of **Sūn Zhōngyàn** [孙忠斓]. Her family lineage traced back to **Níngchū** [宁初], and her mother once dreamed of seven cranes gathering silk quilts to dance in the courtyard. After some time, six cranes flew away, leaving only one that entered her embrace. Upon waking, she found herself with child, and thus this maiden was born.\n\nBy nature, she was exceedingly bright and in her secluded chambers, she adhered strictly to ritual and law. Skilled in calligraphy and literature, she excelled particularly in **poetic compositions** [昤咏].\n\nWhen she became a widow, she married into the **Mǎ** [马] family and bore three sons, all of whom she instructed in **moral and medicinal arts** [义方].\n\nIn the winter of **Dīnghài** [丁亥] in the **Dàdìng** [大定] era, **Zhòngyáng Lǎoshī** [重阳先生] arrived from **Zhōngnán** [终南]. **Mǎ Yí Fǔ** [马宜甫] treated him with great hospitality, but the maiden did not fully trust him. She confined the master within her **hermitage** [庵] for over a hundred days, providing neither food nor drink, and only glimpsed him through the gate. Yet his complexion and bearing surpassed even his usual state, and only then did she embrace his teachings with faith.\n\nEven afterward, the maiden would **manifest divine forms** [神入梦] in dreams and visions, terrifying him with depictions of **hellish realms** [地狱] and enticing him with visions of **heavenly paradises** [天堂]. She bestowed upon him **ten divisions of alms** [十度分梨] and **six rounds of taro gifts** [六番赐芋], and thus **Mǎ Yí Fǔ** followed her as a disciple, entering the **Dao** [道]. Yet the maiden’s affection for her sons lingered, and she hesitated, waiting another year before finally abandoning them—**clad in bamboo hat and coarse robe** [竹冠布袍]—and journeying to the **Golden Lotus Hall** [金莲堂] of her native state to pay homage to **Zhòngyáng Lǎoshī** and seek **initiation** [度].\n\nThe master bestowed upon her a poem:\n*\"Ten alms of divided fruit were given last year,\nHeaven’s timing was ever natural, no need to fear.\nWhy did you not then depart from mortal ties?\nAh, you waited only to pluck the Golden Lotus.\"*\n\nHe further bestowed upon her a **Daoist name** [法名], **Bù Èr** [不二], and a **Daoist title** [道号], **Qīngjìng Sǎnrén** [清静散人]. He instructed her in the **mystic seals of the Celestial Talisman** [天符云篆], granting her the **secret precepts** [秘诀] alone.\n\nWhen **Zhòngyáng Lǎoshī** later passed away in **Bìngliáng** [汴梁] and his remains were returned to **Zhōngnán** [终南] for burial, carried by **Qiū** [丘], **Liú** [刘], **Tán** [谭], and **Mǎ** [马], the maiden heard of it and set out westward, **ascending clouds and crossing moons** [穿云度月], **sleeping in frost and enduring snow** [外雪眠霜], disfiguring her form yet not feeling the pain. By the **first month of Rénchén** [壬辰] spring, she arrived at **Zhào Pénglái’s** [赵蓬莱] residence in **Jīngzào** [京兆], where she met **Dānyáng** [丹阳]. Together, they **shared profound insights** [参同妙旨] and **delved into the depths of Daoist principles** [转涉理窟].\n\n**Dānyáng** then bestowed upon her the **Elixir Refining Sand** [《炼丹砂》]:\n*\"Serve the maiden of Fùchūn* [富春姑],\nDo not follow me blindly—\nNow you are neither woman nor man.\nEach must refine their own **true essence** [真面目],\nEscape the **Three Defilements** [三涂],\nAnd **cultivate the Dao’s qi** [炼气]—do not let the **Hall of Elixir** [厅] deceive you.\nAbove and below, all is **expansive ease** [宽舒],\nEndless as the **mystic breath of the cosmos** [绵绵似有却如无].\nWrap yourself in **embodied purity** [个裹灵童],\n**Harmonize the vital forces** [调引动],\nAnd you shall reach the **Daoist capital** [仙都].\"\n\nThe maiden accepted this with gratitude and parted, each traveling to their own place to **refine the heart within humble walls** [炼心环堵]. Seven years later, her **Three Fields** [三田] were restored, and her **hundred orifices** [百窍] flowed freely.\n\nThen she arose and set out, wandering through **Luòyáng** [洛阳], **guiding and transforming** [劝化接引] and **initiating many disciples** [度人甚多]. One day, she inscribed the **Divination Song** [卜算子]:\n*\"With firm resolve, she clutches her robe and waits,\nAs **water and fire** [水火] merge in ceaseless embrace.\nA million **Daoist paths** [万道] bloom in the **sea of luminous qi** [霞光海底],\nA single strike pierces the **Three Passes** [一撞三关].\n**Celestial music** [仙乐] resounds repeatedly,\nEver drinking the **fermented Daoist wine** [酝酬酒].\nNo need to ask for **wondrous elixirs** [妙药] in every fleeting moment—\nThe **Nine Transformations’ Elixir Sand** [九转丹砂] is complete.\"*\n\nUpon finishing, she told her disciples:\n*\"The master’s **true essence** [真] has its **preordained vow** [约],\nEach must now return to the **Jade Pool** [瑶池].\nMy **Daoist term** [仙期] has arrived.\"*\n\nShe bathed and changed her clothes, then asked those around her:\n*\"How early or late is the **heavenly hour** [天气]?\"*\nThey replied:\n*\"It is high noon.\"*\nShe then **assumed the lotus posture** [结踟趺], sat **serene and upright** [奄然端坐], and **entered the Dao’s natural state** [处顺]. Her visage remained as if alive, and **fragrant breezes** [香风] filled the room. **Auspicious qi** [瑞气] swirled about, descending over the fields, never dispersing throughout the day. This occurred on the **twenty-ninth day of the twelfth month in Rényuán** [壬寅年十二月二十九日].\n\nAt that very time, **Dānyáng** resided within the **Nínghǎi** [宁海] hermitage, gazing upward. He saw the maiden ascending on **five-colored auspicious clouds** [五色祥云], drifting gracefully in the sky, and she spoke to him with a smile:\n*\"I have already returned to **Penglai** [蓬莱] ahead of you.\"*\n\n**Dānyáng**, hearing this, **swept his robes aside** [拂衣] and danced in celebration, composing the **\"Drunken Daoist’s Order\"** [《醉仙令》] to rejoice in his own attainment. The **eulogy** [赞] reads:\n\n*\"Lofty is the name **Bù Èr** [不二],\nGreat is the **cultivation of Oneness** [守一功].\nDescended from the **Fùchūn** [富春] clan,\nBorn into the **Zhōngshàng** [忠翔] family,\nPaired with **Dānyáng’s** transcendent talent [超世之才],\nAnd nurtured by **Nínghǎi’s** half-state [半州之产].\nSevering love, she cast aside her three sons at once,\nAnd **entered the Mystic** [投玄] to worship **Zhòngyáng** [重阳].\nDisfiguring her radiant form to cross westward to **Zhōngnán** [终南],\nEnduring wind and frost to depart from the **sea’s embrace** [海上].\nSeven years within humble walls,\nShe refined the **Nine Transformations’ Elixir Sand** [九转丹砂],\nAnd with a single **true utterance** [一句真诠],\nPierced the **Three Passes’ orthodox path** [三关正路].\nSix times she gave taro,\nTen times she divided fruit—\nShe planted **karmic seeds beyond the ages** [劫外之因绿],\nAnd returned the **transformation within the Elixir Field** [壶中造化].\nShe **nurtured the Daoist embryo** [养胎仙] while her heart wandered freely,\nAnd **shed her mortal husk** [委蜕壳] to arrive at **Penglai** [蓬莱].\nGreat indeed, marvelous indeed—\nShe alone **shared a single Golden Lotus** [独分一朵之金莲],\nAnd **attained a place among the Seven True Ones** [得预七真之仙列].\"*\n\n**Zhāng Shéntóng** [张神童] composed a poem:\n*\"Washed clean of rouge, her cheeks glow like twin clouds,\nTen years’ toil cultivated the **Golden Elixir’s seed** [黄芽].\nWith attainment, she strides firm upon the **Azure Crane’s back** [青鸾],\nAnd blooms fully in the **Golden Lotus’s seventh phase** [第七华].\"\n\n**Fifth Volume of the *Golden Lotus Orthodox Lineage*** [金莲正宗记卷之五] concludes.",

Though the doctrine existed, only seventy-two followed it in practice.\nLater, in the reign of King Wǔdīng of the Shang, the Old Master manifested at Lèiyáng, traversing the Wei Pass to the east and the Flowing Sands to the west, teaching for nine hundred ninety-six years. Then, astride a white deer, he ascended the Azure Cypress, transcended the Azure Deeps, and wandered the Jade Capital.\nYet despite such marvels, people still doubted and failed to embrace the truth.\n\nWhen the Han Celestial Master Zhāng Jìngyìng emerged, he personally received the Orthodox One Scripture, battling demons to establish the Blessed Court, ordaining Daoists as the Sacrificial Master. His teachings flourished, transforming the four seas.\nHe was succeeded by Kǎo, Hào, Dù, and Yè, who exorcised demons and dispelled calamities, accumulating blessings and averting disasters, aiding the state and saving the people, acting as Heaven’s emissaries. For countless generations, monasteries thrived, and emperors revered them.\nAfter the Zhenghé era, the Lin Celestial Master repeatedly displayed divine transformations, and the emperor took faith in him. Though the teachings prospered, the doctrine of nature and life remained obscured and unexplored.\n\nThen, at the end of the Flaming Song dynasty, Zhòngyáng emerged anew, reviving the teachings and focusing solely on nature and life. He transformed the Three Zones and united the Five Assemblies, placing the Golden Lotus at the forefront. Wandering the seas, he initiated seven disciples, embodying gentleness and humility outwardly, quietude and emptiness inwardly, the Nine Returns and Seven Reversions in essence, and myriad transformations in adaptability. He renamed the school *Quánzhēn* (Complete Reality) and altered the robes to incorporate the Eight Trigrams.\n\nWhen our Long Spring Master Qiū Shénxiān received the emperor’s summons and answered the invitation from Yīnshān, he admonished against excess in wine and desire, warned against excessive slaughter, and with a single sincere word, brought spring to ten thousand nations. He rescued countless souls from the brink of suffering, and all hearts turned toward him as rivers flow to the sea. The sturdy and the youthful alike bowed in reverence, while the barbarians of the east and west composed hymns to *Bùxū* (the Uncarved). Families discussed the Dao and Virtue, and everywhere, the teachings of *Xīyí* (the Mysterious and Profound) were expounded. Lazy robes and unbound hair filled the roads, while jade halls and celestial altars dotted the mountains and valleys. Since the time of Xuānxu, no era has seen the Daoist path flourish as it does today.\nThis teaching originates from Zhōnghuá (Central Harmony), flourishes under Zhòngyáng, and branches from Chángchūn. From this point onward, its influence will surge like an overflowing river, its limits unknown. Thus, *The Golden Lotus Orthodox Record* is composed.\n\nWritten in the year *Sīnchǒu* (1231), the *Píngshuǐ* era, under the *Chángchūn Hútian* banner.\n\n---\n**East华 Emperor-Jun (Dōnghuá Dìjūn)**\nThe Emperor-Jun bore the surname Wáng, with the courtesy name Xuánfǔ, and the Daoist title Zhōnghuá Zǐ.\nFrom birth, he exhibited extraordinary bearing, and in youth, he revered the Daoist Way. The Upper True One of White Clouds saw and loved him, saying: *\"A celestial exile sent down from Heaven.\"*\nHe was then led into the mountains, where he received the Green Talismans and Jade Seals, the Golden Precepts and Sacred Scriptures, the Great Elixir’s secret formulas, and the Fire Controller’s Green Dragon Sword method of the Nine Heavens.\nThe Master treasured these teachings with devotion, and after three years of diligent study, mastered their profundities.\nHe then retired to the Yānjiàn Mountains’ Misty Ravine, nurturing his spirit and cultivating his essence.\nAfter some time, he built a thatched hut and dwelled there, inscribing the plaque as *Zhōnghuá Guān* (Central Harmony Monastery). For over a hundred years, he concealed his light and hid his traces, unknown to the world.\nLater, he moved to the southern mountains of Dài State’s Wǔtái, where the Purple Treasury Celestial Cavern now stands, and below, the Daoist County.\nThough he lived among mortals for hundreds of years, he showed no signs of aging. He expounded the Mysterious Sovereign’s teachings, elucidating their wonders, performing hidden deeds for the benefit of all, and his virtue moved Heaven itself. Thus, the Celestial True One bestowed upon him the title *Zhōnghuá Dìjūn* (East华 Emperor-Jun), also called the *Minor Yang Sovereign of the Purple Treasury*.\nHe initiated his disciple, the Pure Yang True Person Zhōnglí Yúnfáng, to succeed and propagate the teachings.\nThe sacred and distant cannot be fully recorded here. The Quánzhēn Dao originates from him, hence he is established as the **First Ancestor of Complete Reality**.\n\nA scholar remarked: *\"The Emperor-Jun’s celestial name is so resplendent, his Daoist worth so towering—why is he not recorded in the Han histories? His lineage, birthplace, and deeds are so obscure.\"*\nI respond: *\"Daoist cultivation often involves seclusion. It is not the urgent priority of establishing teachings for the world, so historians omit or lose track of such figures. Moreover, Confucian scholars disdain speaking of such matters. Over time, inscriptions fade, and thus, we cannot fully discern them.\nEven in the four hundred years of the Han dynasty alone, the number of recluses and hermits is incalculable. How could a few thousand scraps of paper ever record them all?\"*",

      "translated_text": "The Dao/Way of Complete Reality has long been brewing. From the **Celestial Worthy** it was passed down to **Golden Mother**, then to **White Cloud**, and finally to **Imperial Sovereign** (帝君). Heaven, in its intent, entrusted this grand teaching to such a one—how could mere pedants ever bear its weight? Emerging from the **Crimson Cloud and Vermilion Landscape** (紅霞丹景), he was carefully selected as the leader of all the immortals, then descended to the mortal realm.\n\nAt first, his arrival was not without marvelous and extraordinary signs—his radiance dazzling Heaven and Earth! Yet they were hidden and not recorded, for historians dread such things. Thus, they are explicitly stated at the end of the transmission, lest scholars read them without proper reflection.\n\nThe verse says:\n*\"Obscurely rising, the Dragon Tower veiled in misty auspicious clouds,\nThe refined elegance of the Purple Palace, the Minor Yang’s abode.\nKunlun looms high, its radiance stretching a thousand feet,\nWhen first it blooms, the Complete Reality’s foremost flower.\"*\n\n**Zhònglí True Person of Rectified Yang** (正陽鍾離真人) reverently notes from *The Record of Lu Mountain’s Golden Spring Observatory* (《庐山金泉观记》):\n*\"His great-great-grandfather, surname **Pu** (朴),\nHis grandfather, surname **Shǒudào** (守道),\nHis father, surname **Yuán** (源),\nAll during the late **Later Han** (後漢) era,\nHeld strategic positions, with merit to the nation,\nTheir virtues enduring through generations.\"*\n\nThe Master, surname **Zhòng** (鍾), given name **Quán** (權), courtesy name **Yúnfáng** (云房), styled **Zhònglí** (正陽子), was a native of **Hànchāng Xiànyáng** (京兆咸阳).\n\nYoung, he excelled in letters and calligraphy, especially favoring the **Grass Script** (草圣). His height was eight feet seven inches, his beard extended past his navel, and his eyes held divine light.\n\nHe rose to the rank of **Left Advisor** (左谏议大夫), but after submitting a memorial criticizing **Li Jiān’s** (李坚) mismanagement of border affairs, he was exiled as **Commander of Nánkāng** (南康知军). After the **Han** (漢) dynasty fell, he again served under the **Jìn** (晉).\n\nDuring the reign of **Emperor Wǔ** (武帝), he led troops alongside the general **Zhōuchù** (周处), but their campaign faltered, and they fled into the chaotic mountains, their whereabouts unknown. Chance led him to encounter a **Laozi** (老氏) adept, who, when questioned, remained silent but pointed toward **Bùnán** (束南). He immediately journeyed there.\n\nAfter six or seven miles, towering peaks rose abruptly, pine and cypress trees stood in uneven ranks, and within, a pavilion gleamed with golden splendor, its radiance awe-inspiring. Two **Qīngyī** (青衣) attendants stood at the gate, and he bowed, asking: *\"What place is this?\"*\n\nThey replied: *\"The dwelling of the Minor Yang Sovereign of the Purple Palace (紫府少陽君),\nAnd the secondary estate of the **Bùhuá Imperial Sovereign** (束華帝君).\nYour teacher, **Hóu Jūn** (侯君), has long resided here.\"*\n\nThey then invited him inside, where he bowed and saw the **Imperial Sovereign** (帝君). As they conversed and laughed, a boy announced: *\"A guest-immortal has arrived!\"*\n\nThe **Imperial Sovereign** (帝君) went out to greet the three immortal guests. **Zhònglí** (鍾離) peered from the window and saw:\n*\"The first immortal stood eight feet tall,\nWearing green robes with white sashes,\nGrass sandals and a cloud-patterned cap,\nHis eyes flashing with divine light—majestic indeed!*\n*The second, clad in a plain white robe with wide sleeves,\nTied behind his neck, held a iron flute across his chest.*\n*The third, robust and imposing,\nWore a crimson robe, a **Huáyáng** (華陽) headwrap,\nStraddled a **Cāngmáo** (苍毛) tiger,\nAnd grasped a staff horizontally.\"*\n\nThey then led the three immortals into the secondary hall, offering wine, fruits, and fine dishes. Their laughter and camaraderie echoed beyond the hall.\n\nThe **Qīngyī** (青衣) asked:\n*\"How many dusty guests arrive here?\nBy what means do they come?\nThe cave’s door lacks locks or keys—\nFor whom is it opened today?\"*\n\nThe immortals all laughed:\n*\"Once you were **Tiěyī** (鐵衣) child,\nNow you meet one who has attained the Dao/Way (達道人).*\n*How dare a mighty warrior intrude upon this sacred ground!\"*\n\nThe **Iron Flute Immortal** (鐵笛仙) said:\n*\"The Minor Yang’s Purple Palace,\nThe Dragon Tower veiled in misty auspicious clouds,\nPouring cups of wine aged a thousand days,\nEver blooming flowers of the four seasons—*\n*Let the **Rú** (阮) family enjoy them!\"*\n\nThe **Tiger-Riding Immortal** (跨虎仙) said:\n*\"Your teacher personally points the way to **Pénglái** (蓬莱),\nWhy seek further guidance?\nThe immortals know their destined paths—\nFortunate indeed to bow before the High True One!\"*\n\nThe **Imperial Sovereign** (帝君) replied:\n*\"Noble are you, O **Qīngyún** (青云) vessel,\nOur meeting brings joy to my face.\nThe **Red Terrace** (丹台) has its records,\nYet I have been temporarily exiled among mortals.\"*\n\nThe immortals all drank deeply, then departed. The **Imperial Sovereign** (帝君) saw them off, each ascending to the sky astride a **Luán** (鸾) or **Fèng** (凤) with effortless grace. The **Imperial Sovereign** (帝君) then returned and spent the entire day in profound discussion with **Zhònglí** (鍾離), their bond of affection deeper than that of old friends.\n\nHe then transmitted to him:\n*The **Red Seal and Jade Inscription** (赤符玉篆),\nThe **Golden Precepts and Sacred Writings** (金科灵文),\nThe **Great Elixir Secrets** (大丹秘诀),\nThe **Fire Marshal of the Five Circuits** (周天火侯),\nAnd the **Green Dragon Sword Method** (青龙剑法).\n**Zhònglí** (鍾離) reverently received these teachings,\nAnd upon hearing them once, his understanding reached a thousandfold.*\n\nAfter mastering their depths, he bid farewell and descended the mountain, wearing a simple **Zhuīzì** (椎髻) hairstyle and coarse garments. He practiced **accumulating virtue** (积行) to save others, refined his **spirit** (调神) and cultivated his **qi** (炼气), his transformations ever unpredictable.\n\nDuring the **Kāichéng** (开成) era of **Emperor Wénzōng** (文宗) of the **Táng** (唐), while wandering **Lúshān** (庐山), he encountered **Lǚ Gōng** (吕公), the **Cave Guest** (洞宾), who taught him the **Heavenly Escape Sword Method** (天遁剑法), and he called himself the **Scattered Daoist of All Under Heaven** (天下都散汉).\n\nLater, he secluded himself at **Yángjiǎo Shān** (羊角山) in **Jìn** (晉), where the **Celestial Worthy** (天真) bestowed upon him the title **Tàijí Zuǒgōng Bǎoshēng Zhēn rén** (太极左宫保生真人).\n\nHe once inscribed two poems behind the **Guan’āyī Hall** (观音殿) at **Qǐngzhōu Kāiyuán Temple** (邢州开元寺), their strokes soaring like dragons in flight. The poems read:\n*\"To meet a true immortal is no easy thing,\nWhen shall I return, and wish to follow you?\nMy dwelling connects with the **Stárng** (沧) Sea,\nA separate peak, the foremost of **Pénglái** (蓬莱).*\n*Again it says:\nDo not weary of joyous pursuits and frequent laughter,\nYet ponder the sorrows of separation and strife.\nIn leisure, I count with bent fingers from the start,\nHow many have attained **Qīngpíng** (清平)?\"*\n\nIn the **Sòng** (宋) dynasty, **Liú Cóngguǎng** (刘从广) erected a stone stele and had it inscribed during the **September Ninth** (九月九日) of the **Huángyòu** (皇佑) era, the fourth year. There is also an ode that reads:\n*\"To see money as a plague, O True Immortal Child,\nTo meet women with the bearing of a virtuous gentleman.\nCultivating **qi** like a turtle’s slow breath,\nRefining the form to resemble a crane’s skin.\nBorn at the gate of life, yet die at the door of death—\nHow many are the awakened, how many the enlightened?\nLast night, the Iron Warrior pondered deeply,\nLong life and immortality—by whom are they achieved?\"*\n\nHe also compiled *The Collection of True Immortals Transmitting the Dao/Way* (《真仙传道集》) alongside *The Sacred Treasures of the Lingbao* (《灵宝毕法》), passing them to **Lǚ Gōng** (吕公). He spoke of the **Dao/Way of Internal Elixir** (内丹养命), where **Yīn** and **Yáng** harmonize within the **Great Transformation of Heaven and Earth** (天地造化), hidden in the **Mystic Treasury of the Dark Realm** (玄都宝藏) as a mirror for all ages.\n\nAfterward, he again visited **Lúshān** (庐山), ascending the **Three-Level Vermilion Pavilion** (三级红楼) and effortlessly rising into the sky on the **twentieth day of the fifth month** (五月二十日).\n\nThe eulogy states:\n*\"The Dao/Way cannot be attained through empty deceit,\nNor can immortality be achieved through falsehood—\nOnly true practice and genuine cultivation are honored.\"*",

From then on, the **Quánzhēn** teachings gradually took shape, and thus he became the **second patriarch of the Jīnlián Orthodox Line**.\n\nThe verse says:\n*\"Once heard the Iron-Flute Immortal astride a tiger,\nNow the Golden Elixir passed from the Celestial Sovereign.\nAt parting, he entrusted it to Pure Yang Zǐ—\nOn the Three-Level Vermilion Pavilion, beneath the azure sky.\"*\n\nAccording to the *Record of the Stone Inscription at Yuezhou Qingyang Observatory*, his great-grandfather was named **Jǐng**, rising to the rank of **Hanlin Academician and Grand Guardian of the Imperial Library**. His grandfather, **Xiàn**, held the post of **Governor of Henan Prefecture**, and his father, **Wèi**, served as **Minister of Rites**. The Master himself was named **Yán**, with the courtesy name **Dòngbīn**, a native of **Púyì, Pú Prefecture** (modern-day **Púyì, Yǒnglè**).\n\nBorn on the **fourteenth day of the fourth month, in the year Gēngzǐ of Emperor Dèzōng’s Xīngyuán era (827 CE)**, beneath a tree in the **Forest of Birds**, he later achieved the **Jìnshì degree in the year Dīngyǒu of Emperor Wénzōng’s Kāichéng era (840 CE)**, at the age of twenty-two. With a **dragon-like bearing and phoenix-like eyes**, his sparse yet refined brows and beard bore the **metallic and waterly marks** of destiny. He wore the **Huáyáng cap** and **Xiāoyáo robes**, his demeanor resembling that of **Zhāng Zǐfáng** or **Sīmǎ Qiān**.\n\nLater, he served as **Magistrate of Lúshān’s Wǔfēng County**, and during his leisure, he explored the mountain’s wonders. There, he met **Zhèngyáng Zǐ**, and after exchanging but a few words, their hearts aligned. He received the **Great Dao of Heavenly Escape Swordsmanship** and the **Dragon-Tiger Golden Elixir’s Secret Scriptures**, and was bestowed the title **Pure Yang Zǐ**.\n\nFrom that point onward, he resigned his office and titles, devoting himself entirely to the **Dao/Way**, their bond unbreakable as **glue and lacquer**. Soon after, several Immortals personally invited him to the **Gathering of Penglái**. **Lǚ Gōng**, tears streaming, knelt and pleaded with his master: *\"When shall we meet again in the Cloud-Car?\"*\n\nHe then composed a poem in reply:\n*\"At the moment of fulfillment, reunion is hard to find,\nYet now I hear you depart for the Celestial Platform.\nA staff-top spring in a goblet of wine,\nA crown of clouds piercing the Five Peaks.\nThe Tortoise of the Sea knows no man,\nThe符符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*符*",

      "translated_text": "After this, **Lǚ Gōng** hid himself in Shìyáe, sometimes selling elixir to cure the sick and relieve their sufferings, sometimes offering ink to aid the poor. Through accumulated merit and righteous deeds, he ultimately attained true **Dao/Way** mastery, his transformations boundless—now hidden, now revealed. He often traveled between Cāngwú and Nányuè, and once wrote a poem:\n\n*\"Morning I wander in the Southlands, evening in Cāngwú,\nMy sleeves hold the **qi** of a green serpent, bold and vast.\nThree times I entered Yùyáng, yet none recognized me,\nHighly reciting as I flew over Dòngtíng Lake.\"*\n\nDuring the **Song Dynasty**’s Zhènghé era, the **Lǚ Gōng** of Luòyáng’s Shàngqīngguān inscribed two couplets:\n\n*\"I came twice to pay homage to the Three Pure Ones,\nYet the myriad beings of the Four Great Elements see them not.\nNow I return to the dusty world below,\nIn the depths of the Five Clouds, the **Dao/Way**-realm points.\"*\n\nAnd again:\n\n*\"In the depths of the Five Clouds lies my homeland,\nBeyond the Four Great Elements—no longer can I dwell.\nToday I know not if I am a guest,\nFor tomorrow I’ll remain here, beside.\"*\n\nDuring the **Wùzǐ** year’s Mid-Autumn Festival, a practitioner of the **Dao/Way** came to visit **Lǚ Gōng** at his residence in Xījīng. The host obstructed him, but **Lǚ Gōng** was already seated in the hall with an imposing presence. He said, *\"I beg a hundred cups of wine.\"* The host granted them, and he drained them in one sitting. Then he requested three *chǐ* of plain silk, which he dipped in wine, folded, and placed in the bottle before departing without farewell. The host quickly ordered a pursuit, but **Lǚ Gōng** had vanished. Upon opening the bottle and unfolding the silk, they found a painted image—his likeness without distinction, **Dao/Way**-clear and refined, with three fine hairs protruding from his ears. Later, he inscribed two more couplets:\n\n*\"To nourish life, one must drink a hundred cups,\nTo cultivate longevity, let the **Yellow River’s clarity** be the measure.\nThe **Dao/Way** renews itself each day with boundless wisdom,\nThe **Way** unfolds early, as thunder splits the earth’s core.\"*\n\nAnd again:\n\n*\"A body of **obstinate freedom** through ages past,\nYet only the **Supreme Good** can reveal its truth.\nHow many thoughts and deeds I’ve received from your teaching,\nNow floating in the **Dao/Way**-realm, leaving the mundane behind.\"\nHe was later titled **Pure Yang Master**.\n\nDuring the **Xuānhé** era of the **Song Dynasty**, at **Dàiyuèguān** in **Tàishān**, he inscribed a couplet on the stone wall:\n\n*\"Long ago I left my mark here when I came,\nNow my deeds fulfill the Nine Regions of the world.\"*\n\nLater, when thunderous rains struck and **dragon-kind** battled in the skies, the mountain’s cliffs crumbled—yet **Lǚ Gōng**’s ink traces remained untouched. Ninety years later, when another visitor returned, he inscribed another couplet:\n\n*\"The dragons know my intent, so leave no trace,\nThey spare my mark from being buried deep.\"*\n\nAnd again, a single stanza:\n\n*\"Long ago I wandered here,\nNinety springs have passed since then.\nHow many dusty travelers,\nWho would recognize me now?\"*\nHe later signed it as *\"Huígōng’s work.\"*\n\nHis manifestations varied with each place, too numerous to record. In his lifetime, he wrote hundreds of works, collectively titled *The Sword Transmission Anthology*. His soaring transformations were countless—those who followed him could not fathom their number.\n\nLater, in his travels to **Èzhōu**, ascending the **Huánghè Lóu** at noon on the twentieth day of the fifth month, he rose into the clouds, his form barely visible. The common folk gazed in awe, yet only saw him vanish into the mist.\n\nThe praise reads:\n\n*\"From ancient times, those who attained the **Dao/Way** and became Immortals were many, yet why does **Lǚ Gōng**’s name alone stand out? It is because his heart of **compassion and mercy** extends to all, benefiting beings without limit, and touching them most deeply. Even the **old pine’s essence**—a lifeless thing—was taught with care, transformed into the **Supreme God**. How much more so for humans, the most refined of all beings!\n\nThree times he entered **Yùyáng**, bearing the **elixir’s longevity** for a thousand years.\nRevisiting **Dàiyuèguān**, he recited the *Sutra of the Yellow Court* in the two halls.\nHe sought the **essence** of the **Red Phoenix** in the southern lands,\nAnd the **marrow** of the **Black Tortoise** from the northern seas.\nOne grain secures transcendence beyond the world,\nNine refineries scatter blessings among all.\nHe turned stones into gold with a touch,\nAnd willow branches into bones with a fold.\nThose who took his elixir regained youth and vitality,\nThose who met him rose from death, their bodies restored.\n\nA hundred strange forms concealed him,\nHis sleeves held the **Dao/Way**-sword of a green serpent.\nA decree from the Nine Heavens descended,\nHis body flew from the **Huánghè Lóu**’s heights.\n\nThus it is said: a name is a public treasure of the world,\nNot to be claimed by many—how true it rings!\"*\n\nThe poem reads:\n\n*\"Three *chǐ* of green serpent **qi** chills the heart,\nHeaven and Earth shift at my touch.\nOnce I left from the **Huánghè Lóu**’s peak,\nLeaving behind **elixir** for mortals to trade.\"*\n\n**Master Sìu of the Sea Hare**\nThe Master’s surname was **Sìu**, his given name **Cāo**, with the courtesy name **Zōngchéng**, and the sobriquet **Hǎi’án Gōng**.

He then bade farewell and departed.\n\nThe Master thereupon hastened to arrange a nightly banquet, feigning intoxication. He hurled cups, plates, and treasures to the ground, shattering them. His wife and children, along with servants, all angrily rebuked him.\n\nYet even after the morning court session, his face remained grim. He untied his official seal and resigned from office, then acted madly, singing and dancing.\n\nHe composed a song of his own, saying:\n\n*\"I, the **Lǜ Tàisuì**, was born in Yàn,\nRecalling how the **Three Lights** shared their **qi** with me.\nIn the **Mǎo Angle**’s brilliance, my heart stood clear as frost and snow,\nAt sixteen, I swiftly ascended to the **Jìakē** rank.\n\nWith **Jū** and **Zǐ** robes, I bore the **golden seal**’s honor,\nWhile others adorned themselves in **embroidered silks**, their bodies lightly encumbered.\nNow my station reaches the **highest** of **official seals**,\nYet in a blink, all past joys are lost—like a spring dream’s fleeting sigh.\n\nLast night, at the third watch, the family feast was grand,\nMy brother, sister, and wife all waited upon me like servants.\nI feigned drunkenness, overturning cups and plates,\nSmashing **coral** and **precious jade** treasures to dust.\nChildren scorned me, my wife loathed me,\nThey forgot the past pleasures of clothing, food, and ease.\n\nThis morning, my anger still lingers at court’s retreat,\nFor even a minor fault, I dare not excuse.\nFrom this deed, I now realize—\nWho will save me from the **wheel of rebirth**?\nI resign my office, return my seal, and abandon worldly glory,\nWith fervor, I seek a path to escape this mortal coil.\"*\n\nThus, he changed his garments and dwelled in humble places,\nTo shame his former form.\n\nHe also wrote a couplet:\n\n*\"I cast aside the **fire dwelling** with its three thousand dependents,\nI banish the **gate guards** of my hundred thousand household.\"*\n\nLater, he wandered far into the **Qín River basin**,\nRefining his **true essence** before **Tàihuá**,\nHiding his traces beneath **Zhōngnán**,\nNurturing his **qi** and purifying his mind—\nUntil he attained **true perfection**.\n\nOne day, in **Dàizhōu**’s **Shòuning Guān**, he splashed ink to form the four characters **\"Cùihè Qíshòu\"** (Tortoise and Crane of Equal Longevity)**,** over a span of more than a **zàng** (yard). He also inscribed his own likeness on the wall, followed by a request.\n\nLater, in **Chéngdū’s Qīngyáng Guān** in **Xīshǔ**, he splashed ink to form the four characters **\"Qīng’ān Fúshòu\"** (Serene Peace and Blessed Longevity)**.**\nIn **Dàizhōu’s Fènghuáng Shān**, at the **Láiyí Guān**, he splashed ink to form the four characters **\"Shòushān Fúhǎi\"** (Longevity Mountain and Auspicious Sea)**.**\nThough these three places were separated by thousands of **lǐ** (miles),\nHe wrote them all on the same day—\nTo display his boundless **divine transformations**.\n\nAfterward, he inscribed a lengthy poem, saying:\n\n*\"Drunkenly riding a white donkey, I came,\nAnd the copper **tail** was dragged in disdain.\nA **green-eyed barbarian** led me along,\nCarrying a **lean bamboo staff** on his shoulder.\nI forgot the affairs of the dusty world,\nMy home now is **Gě Hóng’s well**.\nI do not study the **Huángtíng Jīng**,\nNor do I boil the **Lónghǔ Dǐng**’s elixir.\nStanding alone in the **urban markets**,\nI accept no invitations from the vulgar crowd.\nI wish to take up the **Pīlì Jīn**,\nAnd ascend to **Kūnlún’s peak**.\nI bought **ten horns** from the **Hángniú**,\nAnd plowed **half a field** in the **stream’s domain**.\nPlanting **millet** and brewing **white wine**,\nThat is the **Daoist’s** tranquil scene.\nDrunkenly reclining beneath ancient pines,\nI converse with **white clouds** on the **ridge**.\nIf I wish to depart, I depart immediately,\nVanishing into the **shadow of an autumn hair**’s breadth.\nThough his **manifestations** were many across the **realms of transformation**,\nI recount only his grandest deeds.\n\nThe **eulogy** reads:\n\n*\"How great the difficulty of attaining wealth and nobility!\nHow great the difficulty of abandoning them!\nYet if one can attain and then abandon them,\nThere is none who will not ascend to the **Great Luo** and wander in **Yùjīng**.*\nFrom ancient times to the present,\nI have seen this in **Master Sìu of the Sea Hare** alone.\n\nFrom the **Jìnshì** rank, he rose to **Chancellor of Yàn**,\nWith **golden seals** in hand, his kindness extended to **nine clans**,\nHis **purple girdle** bore his name across the **four quarters**.\nOne day, he met **Zhèngyáng Zǐ**,\nAnd understood the peril of the **gold coin**’s stacking—\nHe sighed at the **Mǎo Angle**’s ultimate danger,\nShattered the **seven treasures** to turn them to dust,\nAnd regarded **ten thousand gold** as filth.\nHe cast aside the **fire dwelling** of three thousand souls,\nAnd banished the **gate guards** of a hundred thousand households.\nHe resigned his office and danced madly on the **market cliffs**,\nReturned his seal and dwelled in the **mountain wilds**.\nRefining his **qi** beneath **Zhōngnán**,\nNurturing his **true essence** before **Tàihuá**—\nThus, he could **tread upon water and fire** without harm,\nPierce **gold and stone** yet face no obstruction.\nHe rode a **purple phoenix**,\nHeld the **Pīlì Jīn** in his hand,\nRode a white donkey in drunken revelry,\nAnd trod upon **Kūnlún’s peak**.\nHe splashed ink to form four characters,\nChanging his form while separated by thousand-mile mountains—\nTruly, the **Dao** does not betray those who see it!\n\nIndeed, the poem says:\n*\"Smashing coral treasures, they do not invite me to feast,\nI return to the **high peaks**, where white clouds drift.\nThe **Buddha’s lute** ascends straight to **Kūnlún’s summit**,\nLaughing at the **fleeting years** of mortal life.\"*\n\n**Master Zhōngfāng of Chóngyáng**\nThe Master’s given name was **Zhōngfāng**, with the courtesy name **Jiǔqīng**.",

Early in life, he mastered the **Classics** and histories [蚤通经史], and later trained in archery and swordsmanship [晚习弓刀].\n\nWhen the **Qí Fù** [齐阜] and **Chāng Wèn** [昌问] prefectures were abolished, he presented an ode to the **Spring Officials** [春官], yet was dismissed for not conforming to their expectations. Later, he took the **military examination** [武举], and thus attained the highest rank [甲科].\n\nAt the age of forty-seven, he sighed deeply and said: *\"Confucius was free from doubt at forty, and Mencius remained unmoved in heart at forty. I have surpassed them in years, yet still I devour raw flesh and peck at rotten bones, toil for purple robes and hoard gold—is this not the height of folly?\"* He then resigned from office, broke his official seal [解印], cast aside his wife and children, dusted off his robes and left the worldly affairs behind, resembling the **wandering madman of Chu** [楚狂] in his reckless abandon.\n\nIn the year **Jìmǎo** [己卯] of the **Zhènglóng** [正隆] era, when he was forty-eight, he passed by a butcher’s stall at **Gānhé Bridge** [甘河桥], savoring the marrow and chewing heartily. Suddenly, two **Daoists** [道者], each clad in white felt [白毡], emerged stealthily from the south. Their bearing was as ethereal as mist and clouds [烟霞态度], their spirit as boundless as the heavens and the sea [霄汉精神]. Observing their brows and eyes, they seemed strikingly alike.\n\nThe Master did not notice them at first but was startled to his feet and approached. He bowed his head slightly and greeted them with a forward bow [倪首前揖]. Their speech was entirely beyond the worldly [出世语], and through their words, he shed his dust and purified his stains, removed his ignorance and dispelled his blindness. It was as if he had drunk and suddenly awakened, as if he had been sick and now recovered. They secretly imparted the **authentic Daoist methods** [真诀], and he was renamed **\"Zhù\"** [矗], with the courtesy name **\"Zhīmíng\"** [知明], and styled himself **\"Master Zhòngyáng\"** [重阳子].\n\nAfter their instruction concluded, one of the **Daoists** pointed to the southern direction and asked: *\"Why do you not observe it?\"*\nThe Master turned and looked back, but the **Daoist** said: *\"What do you see?\"*",

      "translated_text": "「When the time came to the **Mid-Autumn Festival**, passing through **Líquán** County, the Master encountered the **Daoist** again. He hastened forward and bowed to him. The **Daoist** then invited him into a tavern, where they drank together. During their conversation, the Master inquired about his homeland, and the **Daoist** replied: *\"I reside in **Púzhé Yǒnglè** [蒲圾永乐].\"*\n\nThe Master further asked his age, and the **Daoist** answered: *\"Twenty-two years of spring and autumn.\"*\"\n\nWhen asked about his lineage, the **Daoist** remained silent. The Master then requested a brush and paper to record five secret teachings, which he instructed the Master to read carefully. The Master read them repeatedly before grasping their profound principles, and he solemnly warned: *\"The celestial **Dao/Way** must not be carelessly revealed.\"* He immediately ordered the papers burned in the fire.\n\nThe **Daoist** said: *\"Hurry to **Shùhǎi** [束海], where in the **Qiū Liú Tán** [丘刘谭] region there is a noble steed. You may capture it.\"* Having spoken, he vanished without trace.\n\nThe first of these teachings read:\n*\"Suddenly arriving in **Qín** lands, wandering through **Cháng'ān**, some sell **elixir** in the marketplaces, others hide their traces in the mountains and forests. Following such paths for years, one sees countless **common folk**, all coarse and wicked—mere **lower demons**. Now you meet my disciple, why not abruptly cast aside the **mundane world**, awaken fiercely to its vanity, and relish **dew of the clouds** before the **jade capital’s** splendor? Fit to refine **qi** beneath the **pine peaks**, you may govern **creation** and reverse the **yin-yang**, arraying the **constellations** within the **Nine Cauldrons** and gathering **all transformations** into a single **cauldron**. With a thousand days of merit fulfilled, your name will be inscribed in the **Immortal Registers**; after three years of diligence, you shall eternally pacify the **eons** of **samsara**. Fear that your tardiness may cause your body to sink into the **underworld’s depths**.\"*\n\nThe second teaching read:\n*\"Do not cling to **wine and feasting** in the **mundane world**, nor let yourself be bound by earthly concerns.\nWhen **Dragon** and **Tiger** stir, snowflakes scatter like waves;\nwhere the water’s voice is clear, the **profane dust** dissolves.\nSince my awakening on the **path**, my words have strayed but still hold meaning.\nOne day, when the **Nine Refined Elixir** is complete,\nI shall depart with my companions to **Pénglái**.\"*\n\nThe third teaching read:\n*\"The **Qiao Dragon** is refined in the **Fire Beacon Pavilion**,\nthe **Meng Tiger** captured to ensnare the **Water Spirit**.\nDo not force the **Dao/Way** nor debate its principles—\nsuch **errant talk** only complicates matters.\"*\n\nThe fourth teaching read:\n*\"Lead is the **medicine of mercury**,\nmercury the **essence of lead**—\nknowing lead and mercury,\n**nature abides** and **life is suspended**.\"*\n\nThe fifth teaching read:\n*\"When the **Nine Refined Elixir** is perfected,\nenter **Nánjīng**,\nfind a **true friend**,\nand proceed to **Péngléng**.\"*\n\nThe Master then returned to **Qiū Liú** [丘刘], constructing a small hermitage for himself. He inscribed upon its lintel: *\"The Tomb of the Living Dead\"* [活死人墓], and erected a paper plaque above it reading: *\"The Position of King Harm-Wind’s Spirit\"* [王害风灵位]. He composed a poem:\n\n*\"The Living Dead, King Harm-Wind’s fate,\nWater and clouds—another kind of harmony.\nThe **Daoist name** calls me **Chóngyáng** [重阳] Master,\nMy **maddened cry** is called ‘No-Ground-Buried.’*\n*The **path** of those who come,\nI shall not forget—\nTraveling, they must hang the **Spirit Plaque**.*\n\nOne day, he carried a single **gourd of wine** and stood by the roadside. A **Daoist** called out: *\"Harm-Wind! Harm-Wind! Bring me your wine!\"* The Master responded in kind, offering him a drink until the **gourd was empty**. The **Daoist** then sent the Master with the **empty gourd** to the **Sweet River** [甘河] to fetch water, commanding him to drink it himself. The water tasted exquisite—truly the **elixir of the Immortals**. The **Daoist** revealed himself: *\"I am **Hǎi Chán** [海蟾], the **Master of the Sea**.\"* Having spoken, he vanished once more.\n\nFrom that time onward, the Master no longer drank **wine**, but only **water**. He often appeared intoxicated, and thus he recounted the *\"Fisherman’s Song\"* [《虞美人》]:\n\n*\"Harm-Wind drinks water—how much does he know?\nThis way, the **mysteries** become clear.\nIn a **white hemp** robe, with a **green silk** headband,\nHis bearing is refined—truly a **spirited** man.\nNo need for mirrors to reflect his form,\nFor all things are revealed in his heart.\nHe discerns the **body in dreams** as the **dream itself**,\nA true **free and easy wanderer** who has crossed to the **other shore**.\nOne day, he suddenly burned his hermitage.\nNeighbors rushed to save the flames, but the Master only swayed and danced.\nWhen asked the reason, he replied: ‘In three years, another will take up the **practice**.’\nHe inscribed a poem:\n\n*'The thatched hut burns—no need for further action,\nFor another will soon come to **cultivate**.*\n*To be **awakened** is to be **fierce**,\nHow can one learn my **effortless grace**?*\n\nIn the **seventh year of the Dàdìng** [大定] era, on the **twenty-sixth day of the fourth month**, he leisurely wandered toward **Shùhǎi**, passing through **Xiányáng**. There, he sketched a portrait of himself as a **three-crowned Daoist**, with **lush green pines** sheltering him, **white clouds** swirling about, and a **crane** dancing in **transcendent elegance**. Upon meeting **Shǐ Fēngxiān** [史风仙], he joyfully gave him the sketch, saying: *\"Wait until I capture the **steed** and present it to you as a **companion**.\"*\n\nHe then traveled to **Luòyáng**, where he visited the **Upper Clarity Palace** [上清宫] and inscribed a poem on its wall:\n\n*\"Qiū, Liú, and Tán’s King Harm-Wind captures the **steed**,\nOn **Kūnlún’s** peak, he strikes the **jade ball**.\nYou still linger within the **cyclic world**,\nGaining **three thousand eight hundred measures** of merit.\nAt **Shùhǎi** in **Wèizhōu**, I met **Xiāo Zhēnrén** [萧真人],\nWho bore **Daoist** mien and **spirit of the Way**—\nI longed to guide him, lingering for days.\nYet our words did not align, so I gave him the *\"Mùshān Stream\"* [蓦山溪]:\n\n*'The **True Person** has already awakened,\nHis fame reaches the **four seas** first.*\n*Only because he has heard the **teachings**,\nHe remains distant from the **Supreme Primordial’s** **mystic Dao/Way**.*\n*Alas, his **Immortal essence**,\nFalls into a **demonic mortal form**—\nEqually **decayed**, equally **aged**,\nAll striving toward the same end.*\n*He does not know the **mysteries**,\nNor does he scorn **body and mind**.*\n*Like the **deaf and blind**, he passes days,*\n*Mocked for not recognizing the **elixir furnace** and **tortoise**.*\n*He takes these two things,\nRefines them in the **cauldron**,\nAnd when the **elixir** is consumed,\nHe gains **longevity**, returning to **Péngdǎo** with his hands clasped.*\n\nThe **True Person** read it but could not fathom its **profound meaning**—he only nodded in acknowledgment.\n\nThe **Master** then continued toward **Shùhǎi**, wandering along its shores for years, **drawing and transforming** disciples. He gathered **Qiū, Liú, Tán, Mǎ, Hǎo, Sūn, and Wáng**—seven in total—thus completing the **number of the Seven Golden Lotuses**. He universally transformed **three states**, leading them to **five assemblies**:\n1. **Equality** [平等],\n2. **Golden Lotus** [金莲],\n3. **Jade Flower** [玉华],\n4. **Three Lights** [三光],\n5. **Seven Treasures** [七宝].\n\nThe inscription on its lintel read:\n*\"I consider **Equality** the **root of Dao/Virtue and Power** [道德],\nthe **source of purity and struggle** [清挣],\nthe **foundation of the Golden Lotus and Jade Flower**,\nand the **core of the Three Lights and Seven Treasures**.\nIt universally benefits all **living beings**,\nand universally liberates the **common folk**.\nIts **silver flames** fill the **eight extremes**,\nand its **rainbow mists** rise to the **ten directions**.\nAll wish to **spit forth** at the **Yellow Sprout** [黄芽],\nNone linger in the **Black Path** [黑路].\"*",

      "original_text": "先生宁海人也，号日丹阳子。 祖讳觉，字华叟，通五经，为人信义，言无宿诺。 尝贩缯於邻境，暮憩邸中，见一贫妇僻踊哭泣，闻人说云：此贞妇也，良人少亡，誓不复嫁，孝养舅姑。 不幸并亡，无资以葬，方欲质身以为棺椁之费。 公正色言曰：乡邻疾病尚且扶持，里有死亡不为助给，非孝义之坊也，解缣二束而赠之，不通姓氏，趋走前邸。 是夕公之财物为暴客所劫，遂不告人，怡然而归。 其妻问之，托言赊贷。 后经半载，盗者分脏不均，经公首露，公曰：脏物纷纭展转，相关连坐非一，枉遭推勘，脏满百疋，犯至极刑，非好善之所为也。 可持银二两，补尔下平之怒。 其人遂感谢而去。 时方岁饥，曝米於庭，邻妇窃之，公出潜见，复隐身而避之，任彼将去。 父讳师扬，字希贤，姿貌魁秀，沉静有度量。 生子五人，取仁义礼智信为名，号日五常。 马氏之坊甚富於赀，故号曰马半州。 弟侄三人，皆擢进士，故有余庆堂，今改为降仙坊者是也。 至辛亥岁，饥馑荐臻，八月清旦，有客仓皇掷细复於案上，辄过门，而不知所往。 公欲收入巾箱问，举之甚重，解而观之，金色射目，以权衡称之，其重两镒。 旬日客来，即奉与之，客谢曰：吾吕仙也，家在幽谷村，陶采为业，得金两镒，欲货於市。 税监逼逐，几陷於刑，赖公以免。 愿两分之，聊以酬恩。 公曰：横来之金，虑招其祸。 辞而不受。 吕仙曰：公有黄向之风，异日子孙当出神仙。 自后公屡访幽谷人问吕仙安否，会云：素无吕氏之家，疑其神人也。 先生之母所有宝翠为家婢窃而去之，众人皆言急逐可得，公一无所问，由是资财益广，享年六十有四。 先生第二子也，讳从义，字宜甫，癸卯岁五月二十日子时生。 母唐氏，梦谒麻姑，赐丹一粒，吞而分瑞，体如火色，七日方消，手握双拳，百日乃舒。 为儿时常诵乘云驾鹤之语，梦中屡从道士登天。 良贱四十余口，每敛退食器，舌舐残粒，身服旧裳。 昔道士李无梦炼大丹於昆箭，三载弗成，曰神仙降临则丹成矣。 一旦先生与豪杰相从游戏，至於炉下，丹乃转成。 无梦见而奇之，谓先生曰：额有三山，手垂过膝，真大仙之材矣。 因为颂曰：身体堂堂，面圆耳长，眉修目俊，准直口方。 相好具足，顶有神光。 宜甫受记，同步蓬庄。 厥丹乃成，先生之德，因此见称。 孙忠显美无梦之言，以女妻之，生子三人，日廷珍、廷瑞、廷珪。 先生以孝悌见称，夙赋聪明，长通经史，好与童稚戏狎，轻财重义，出举收质无可入还者，皆焚其券。 大定二年秋蝗大饥，佃客刘进盗杀耕牛将尽，遽往视之曰：年谷不登，困乏粮食，吾将赈济，汝不念牛为耕稼之本，使无罪而就死地，吾不忍也。 使刘进自负皮角而行，於是老幼号恸，告之曰：方今法令严明，此去必犯刑宪，使父子不相见矣。 先生不言，乃往经阁院，施皮五张，令刘进面对三宝，具陈杀牛之愆，庶解冤结。 时人歌曰：古杨陈皇，今谈宜甫。 有无知少年持钱三百来续绫袄，故相欺诈，先生赐钱半千。 少年恶其小惠，辄嘤唾之，值郭奉信叱而退之。 或曰：面上有唾，拭之使乾。 曰：拭之是违其怒，正使自乾耳。 先生谓同志曰：昨梦二人皆衣皂褐，内一人素补两肩，泣告予曰：我辈十万人性命在公所主。",
      "translated_text": "「Master Ma of Ninghai, whose courtesy name was **Danyangzi** [丹阳子].\nHis grandfather was surnamed **Jue** [觉], with the courtesy name **Huaxiou** [华叟], well-versed in the **Five Classics** [五经], a man of **virtue** [德] and **trustworthiness** [信义], never breaking a word once spoken. He once traded silk in neighboring regions, resting at an inn in the evening, and saw a poor widow weeping alone in a secluded corner. When asked, she was said to be a **chaste woman** [贞妇], whose husband had died young, who had sworn never to remarry and instead cared for her aged parents-in-law. Alas, they both passed away, leaving her without means to bury them; she was about to sell herself to pay for the **coffin and burial chamber** [棺椁] expenses.\n\nThe Master, with a stern expression, said: *\"Even when neighbors are sick, I assist them; when there is a death in the village, I do not fail to help with provisions—this is not the conduct of a **virtuous** [德] and **righteous** [义] man.\"* He then gave her two bundles of silk and left without inquiring her surname, hurrying to the inn ahead of her. That very night, his belongings were robbed by bandits, yet he said nothing to anyone, calmly returning home. His wife asked about it, and he feigned it was a loan.\n\nHalf a year later, the thieves quarrelled over their divided spoils, revealing the Master’s stolen goods. The Master remarked: *\"The stolen items have been passed around and resold, involving many in legal trouble—this is not a single crime. I’ve endured countless investigations, and the stolen goods amount to over a hundred bolts of silk. If I had reported it, I would have faced the severest punishment. This is not the act of one who does good.\"* He then gave the man two taels of silver to appease his anger, and the thief departed in gratitude.\n\nDuring a famine, the Master spread grain to dry in the courtyard, and a neighbor stole some. When the Master saw her, he concealed himself and let her take what she would, allowing her to leave without hindrance. His father, surnamed **Shiyang** [师扬], with the courtesy name **Xixian** [希贤], was tall and handsome, composed and measured in his bearing. He had five sons, each named after the **Five Constants** [仁义礼智信], collectively called **Wuchang** [五常]. The **Ma family** [马氏] was wealthy, earning the nickname **Mabanzhou** [马半州]. Three of his younger brothers all passed the **imperial examination** [进士], so he built a hall called **Yucheng Tang** [余庆堂], later renamed **Jiangxian Fang** [降仙坊].\n\nBy the year **Xinhai** [辛亥], famine had reached its peak. On a clear morning in the eighth month, a guest frantically tossed a **golden ingot** [细复] onto the table before rushing out without a word. The Master intended to return it by placing it in a cloth bag, but when he lifted it, its radiance was blinding. He weighed it with a balance scale, and it weighed two **jin** [镒]. Ten days later, the guest returned and the Master gave it to him. The guest thanked him, saying: *\"I am **Master Lü Xian** [吕仙], from the village of **Yougu** [幽谷]. I gather herbs for a living. I obtained this two-jin golden ingot to sell in the market, but the tax collector drove me away, nearly bringing me to ruin. Thanks to you, I was spared. I wish to repay you by splitting the gold.\"* The Master declined, saying: *\"This gold came unexpectedly; accepting it might invite misfortune.\"* Lü Xian insisted, and the Master refused again.\n\nLü Xian said: *\"You possess the **auspicious features of the Yellow Emperor** [黄向之风], and in time, your descendants will rise as **Daoist immortals** [神仙].*\" Thereafter, the Master often visited the **Yougu villagers** [幽谷人] and asked after Lü Xian. When told that no Lü family existed there, he suspected the man was indeed a **Daoist adept** [神人].\n\nThe Master’s mother had jade ornaments stolen by a maidservant, but when others urged him to press charges, he took no action. Thus, his wealth only grew, and he lived to the age of sixty-four. He was the second son of his family.\n\nHis son was surnamed **Congyi** [从义], with the courtesy name **Yipu** [宜甫], born on the twentieth day of the fifth month in the year **Guimao** [癸卯]. His mother, **Madame Tang** [唐氏], dreamed she was visited by **Magu** [麻姑], who gave her a **pill of elixir** [丹], which she swallowed. Its glow lingered for seven days before fading, and she clutched her fists tightly for a hundred days before relaxing them. As a child, he often recited phrases of **riding the clouds and astride a crane** [乘云驾鹤], and in dreams, he frequently accompanied Daoists in ascending to heaven.\n\nWith **forty-some dependents** [良贱四十余口], he would gather leftover food from their meals, licking the remaining grains, and wear his old clothes. Once, the Daoist **Master Li Wumeng** [李无梦] refined the **Great Elixir** [大丹] in **Kunjian** [昆箭], but after three years, it remained unfinished. He said: *\"The elixir will only complete when **Daoist immortals** [神仙] descend.\"* One day, the Master played with a group of **bold and virtuous men** [豪杰] near the furnace, and the elixir suddenly transformed. Li Wumeng saw this and marveled, saying to the Master: *\"Your forehead bears the **Three Mountains** [三山], and your hands extend past your knees—you are truly the material of a **Great Immortal** [大仙].\"* He then composed a verse in praise:\n\n*\"A stately figure, round face and long ears,\nRefined brows and bright eyes, straight nose and square mouth.\nAll features complete, a divine radiance crowns your brow—\n**Yipu**, you are marked by the **Way** [道].\"*\n\nThe Master, **Yipu**, received this praise and walked in harmony with **Pengzhuang** [蓬庄]. The elixir was thus perfected, and the Master’s **virtue/power** [德] became renowned. His grandson **Zhongxian** [忠显] admired Li Wumeng’s words, so he married his daughter to him, and they had three sons: **Tingzhen** [廷珍], **Tingrui** [廷瑞], and **Tinggui** [廷珪].\n\nThe Master was known for his **filial piety and respect for elders** [孝悌], and from youth, he was endowed with **keen intelligence** [聪明]. He mastered the **Classics and histories** [经史], often playing with children, and though he was **generous with wealth** [轻财], he **valued righteousness** [重义] above all. When he lent money or took pawns that could not be repaid, he burned the receipts.\n\nIn the autumn of **Dading** [大定] **Year Two**, a great locust plague and famine struck. A tenant, **Liu Jin** [刘进], stole and killed a plow ox, nearly exhausting its value. The Master went to him and said: *\"The harvest has failed, and you are in dire need of food. I will provide relief, but you should not have slaughtered the ox—the very foundation of your livelihood—without cause, driving an innocent creature to its death.\"* He ordered Liu Jin to carry the ox’s hide himself.\n\nThe old and young wailed in grief, and the Master told them: *\"The law is strict now; if you go, you will surely face punishment, and father and son will never meet again.\"* The Master said nothing more, then went to the **Jingge Yuan** [经阁院], offering five hides to the **Three Treasures** [三宝]—Liu Jin, kneeling before them, confessed his crime of killing the ox, hoping to clear his guilt.\n\nPeople sang of him:\n\n*\"In ancient times, there was **Yang Chenghuang** [杨陈皇],\nNow we speak of **Yipu** [宜甫].\"*\n\nA reckless youth came with three hundred coins to buy a **silk-lined jacket** [绫袄], but the Master gave him five hundred instead. The youth, resenting this small kindness, spat on his face. **Master Guo Fengxin** [郭奉信] scolded him and drove him away. Someone suggested wiping the spit from his face, but the Master said: *\"Wiping it would defy his anger; let him dry it himself.\"*\n\nThe Master told his **like-minded companions** [同志]: *\"Last night, I dreamed of two men, both clad in coarse robes. One had patched both shoulders, weeping as he begged me: ‘Our ten thousand lives rest in your hands.’\"*",

      "translated_text": "The True Person replied:\n*\"Where the Five Phases do not reach,\nBefore one’s parents gave birth to me.\"*\n\nThey spoke of the Mysterious, and before long, a wind arose upon the mat.\nThus, the Master invited the True Person to dwell in his household. His wife, Lady Fuchun, lifted the curtain to behold him and said to the Master:\n*\"I observe your guest’s face like a red lotus leaf, his eyes as green as jade, his voice like a great bell, his speech like a gushing spring—his bearing is noble, bearing the radiance of the True Yang. He is one worthy of wholehearted reverence.\"*\n\nFrom then on, they treated him with the rites due a teacher.\n\nThe True Person said to the Master:\n*\"I wish to seal myself in the hut for a hundred days without food.\"*\n\nThe Master complied, and a small chamber was prepared. Though winds and snows assailed it, the ink in his inkstone did not freeze. Outside, those seeking poems came and went like weaving threads; he would take up his brush, and verses would flow forth, complete in an instant.\n\nOften, his Yang Spirit would manifest and sit in the hall. The Master sent someone to gaze upon it, and there, within the hut, he sat in solemn silence.\n\nFrom the first auspicious day of the eleventh month, he revealed one poem and one word composition each, bidding the Master respond in kind. He then bestowed a single pear, which they ate together. Every five days, six yams or chestnuts were given; on the eleventh day, two pears, to be shared by the couple. Thereafter, for every ten days, the portion increased by one—three portions for thirty days, four for forty, until at a hundred days, it reached fifty-five pieces, harmonizing with the odd pairing of Heaven and Earth.\n\nThe Master gradually awakened to the True Principle and abandoned his wife and children, donning the Daoist cap and begging for alms to subdue his heart. The True Person rejoiced.\n\nOne day, the True Person spoke:\n*\"The Master has broken through the Dao.\"*\n\nThe Master asked:\n*\"How do you know this?\"*\n\nThe True Person replied:\n*\"Last night, I dreamed of drinking wine. I sent someone to inquire, and the Master said, ‘I took medicine with wine and drank too much.’ I knew of it beforehand.\"*\n\nHe then ascended Kunjian’s Misty and Verdant Grotto. Suddenly, the Master fell gravely ill with a splitting headache, as if his skull would burst. People said:\n*\"The Master may not live through the morning.\"*\n\nThe True Person declared:\n*\"I traveled three thousand miles to transform this man—how could I let him die?\"*\nHe dipped his hand in water and gave it to him. After drinking, the Master recovered.\n\nIn the autumn of the ninth year of the *Dading* era, the True Person led the Master and three others westward. The governor of Lingzhou, Xieshile, received them with teacherly rites and asked:\n*\"When shall we meet again?\"*\n\nThe True Person answered:\n*\"At Liang Garden.\"*\n\nLater, the True Person ascended to the clouds at Yimen. When Xieshile was later reassigned as deputy commander of the Southern Capital, he became the Master’s host for the funeral rites. After the True Person’s departure, the Master gathered his disciples and entered Jingzhao, begging for Daoist alms, obtaining tens of thousands. They then bound themselves in a vow to travel together, retrieving the True Person’s golden bones for reburial in Zhongnan. His hair was bound in three knots, and he mourned in seclusion for six years, sitting silently in his chamber.\n\nThe three knots symbolized the three auspicious characters—his posthumous name—so he held them in reverence.\n\nThe Master’s resolve was as unyielding as iron and stone, his conduct as uncompromising as frost and snow. For thirteen years, he wandered and transformed, wearing only coarse hemp, never touching money, and sleeping exposed beneath the stars. When people pitied his cold, he replied:\n*\"Do not marvel that I go without cover in the three winters—\nI have kept one spark in my elixir field.\"*\n\nOne day, he told his disciple, Lai Lingyu:\n*\"What do people of Guanzhong call it when a torn garment is mended?\"*\n\nLai Lingyu answered:\n*\"They call it *zhexi*—folding and washing.\"*\n\nThe Master said:\n*\"The Daoist teachings here have grown tattered and broken—\nI must mend them.\"*\n\nBefore half a month had passed, an imperial edict arrived, ordering Daoist priests to return to their native regions. The Master then departed the pass.\n\nMaster Changchun Qiu was then in Longshan. One day, he said to Li Daxiong:\n*\"The Dao here is bound. Though I am listed in the edict, I cannot leave the pass. If I were to leave, the Daoist winds of Qin would be swept clean away.\"*\n\nHe descended the mountain with the green robes, and the officials and people of the prefecture jointly petitioned to retain him. He returned to his mountain dwelling.\n\nAfter the Master left the pass, wherever he went, the villagers wore their hair in topknots and donned white, singing and dancing in the streets. As he approached, they flocked to greet him like phoenixes and auspicious stars, vying to catch a glimpse of him.",

He went directly to the *Encountering the Immortal Pavilion*, where the Master asked: *\"From where have you come?\"*\n\nHe replied: *\"From a journey of thousands of miles—I came only to steady the drunkard.\"*\n\nAll were astonished by his words. The Master then asked: *\"What is your Daoist name?\"*",

      "original_text": "既还乡里，复见屠者刘清，教之曰：曩日壁问之颂，不觉流年二十换矣，以日计之，日宰三猜，十万之数亦已足矣，况公寿八十有三，族广家豪，理当止#1杀。 公方省悟，遂择日设斋，持砧器於郭门外焚之。 是日往金莲堂，见其六味咸苦，不堪供给，先生临井呎之，甘若醴泉，郡人号日灵液，构亭立碑，传於四方。 壬寅年五月，束牟大旱，嘉苗槁矣，俯梼山川，一无所应，州县官长礼请先生，庶获沾足，名香一热，膏雨沛然。 逮秋七月，郡人设大醮於朝元观，连日阴雨，道俗惶恐，疑将败其坛惮，先生曰：无忧，今日必晴。 果如其言。 至中元焚词之际，五云缭绕，鸾鹤徘徊，其感应之速也如此。 仲冬行过登州，信士韩公焚香致祷曰：家有苦井，愿少垂法力，庶回其味。 先生即往咒之，其味顿变，甘如饴蜜。 日晚雨作，遂留宿於韩宅，戏书云：门外雨飕飕，天留人不留。 主公犹自可，打破道人头。 众皆莫晓其意，须臾有康禅问道於先生，忽见檐瓦堕空，正中其首，众方骇然悟末后一句也。 重阳日醮毕，天门启於束南，祥云集於月际，郡人莫不瞻拜。 二月八日，先生劝束牟琅琊村人悉焚船网，风回雪霁，忽见重楼翠阜，异事骇人，乃海市现於南阳也。 癸卯年四月十三日，主行芝阳醮事，而风雨大作，众人哀梼，庶获晴霁。 先生叩齿冥目，似有所祝，须臾云敛日出。 十五日申未问，龙尾现於束南，移时不灭。 至夜，彩云贯月。 四月二十八日，行诣芝阳，海市乃见，自旦至午。 先生至回光庵，马从仕喜自愿焚贷粮券千有余斛，继有鞠赋聚鱼网而焚之，海市复现，依稀若龙车鹤驭之状。 又有郭亨、乐周者，聚鱼网而焚之，忽见桑岛之问，蕾买阵横斜，烟光缥缈，若甲马神兵之势。 先生居华亭之环堵，林擒一株，枝枯心槁，将伐为薪。 四月初九日，沃之以水，俄有门人姚铉持纯阳真人家谱至，方知四月十四日生於林擒下，先生怡然曰：予五月二十日生，比及此时决生芽叶。 乃作颂云：天上三十六，地下三十六，天地入宝瓶，七十二候足。 李公稽首请释其颂，先生笑曰：此隐语也，他日自当知之。 五月十七日，李公夜梦林擒南北各生二叶，旦而视之，芽果生矣。 至先生庆诞之辰，绿叶成阴，方解其颂，云：四九三十六日，天地相合为七十二日，气候充足，变枯为荣，何有难乎。 全真庵移竹两丛、松一株，时四月间也，枝叶萎黄，道友崔公告先生曰：此松竹还得再荣乎。 先生欣然作诗二篇云：道家门户号长生，意要乾枯改旧形。 常使数竿常绿绿，不教一叶不青青。 又曰：我通生法斡旋生，布气形骸转换形。 窗外不惟君子绿，庵前又喜大夫青。 遂以涤面水沃之，不旬日抽心展叶。 金玉庵六月初三日植小松六株，众人稽首曰：全真庵之松竹得复荣旺，金玉庵之小松独何憔瘁。 先生乃以真气三时布之，作诗三绝云：六月庵前种六松，故然返到马风风，三番布气无多力，六愿，还生有大功。 又云：当时数伏故栽松，道友闲闲试马风，我说六株无自活，人传三髻有真功。 六月初三种小松，六株变色遇扶风。 祈荣我借重阳气，应效人传三髻功。 其松更不改柯易叶，青翠可爱，邑人遂刊诗於石。 昔吕纯阳以药一丸，诗一绝活莱州龙兴寺枯槐，於今尚在，其诗曰：长拖布袖出河束，夜宿祇堂古庙中。",
      "translated_text": "Upon returning to his native village, he met the butcher Liu Qing and instructed him: *\"In the past, when you asked me about the verse on the wall, twenty years had already passed unnoticed—counting by the day, you slaughter three beasts daily, and even ten thousand would be insufficient. How much more so for you, a man of eighty-three winters, with a vast lineage and noble family? It is only right to cease killing.\"*\n\nThe man then awoke to reason and chose a day to hold a vegetarian feast, carrying his chopping block and utensils to the city gate to burn them.\n\nThat day, he visited the Golden Lotus Hall, where the six flavors—bitter, sour, salty, and the rest—were unfit for offering. The Master stood by the well and struck it with his foot; the water became sweet as *li* spring, and the county folk called it the \"Numinous Elixir.\" They built a pavilion and erected a stele, spreading the tale far and wide.\n\nIn the year *Rén-Yín* (壬寅), the fifth month, a great drought struck Shùmòu, withering the young crops. The people implored the rivers and mountains in vain, but when the prefectural and county officials respectfully invited the Master, hoping for even a drop of his virtue, a single incense’s worth of warmth arose, and a downpour of nourishing rain fell.\n\nBy the seventh month of autumn, the county folk held a grand *jiào* ritual at the Cháoyuán Observatory. Days of gloomy rain left the laity and Daoists in dismay, fearing the altar would be ruined. The Master said, *\"Fear not—today will surely clear.\"* And so it was.\n\nWhen the time came to burn the *wén* scriptures at the Mid-Autumn Festival, five clouds coiled about the sky, and cranes and phoenixes lingered in the air. Such was the swiftness of his response.\n\nIn mid-winter, as he passed through Dēngzhou, the devotee Hàn Gōng burned incense and prayed: *\"My family’s well is bitter—if only you would deign to lend your power, perhaps its taste might change.\"* The Master went and chanted over it, and instantly the water turned sweet as honey.\n\nAs evening fell and rain began, he stayed overnight at Hàn’s residence. In jest, he wrote:\n*\"Outside the gate, the rain patters—*\n*Heaven keeps the guest, but not the host.*\n*My lord may yet endure,*\n*But smash the Daoist’s skull!\"*\n\nNone understood the last line until Master Kāngzhēn came to inquire, when suddenly a tile from the eaves fell and struck him squarely on the head. Only then did the crowd grasp the meaning of the final verse.\n\nOn the Double Ninth Festival, after the *jiào* ritual concluded, the Celestial Gate opened in the southwest, and auspicious clouds gathered at the moon’s edge. The county folk could not help but bow in reverence.\n\nOn the eighth day of the second month, the Master urged the villagers of Lángyá in Shùmòu to burn all their fishing nets and boats. The wind shifted, the snow melted, and suddenly, a towering emerald peak appeared—a marvel that stunned all, for it was the *hǎishì* (sea-market illusion) manifesting in Nányáng.\n\nIn the year *Guǐmǎo* (癸卯), on the thirteenth day of the fourth month, as the Master conducted a *jiào* ritual in Zhīyáng, a violent storm arose. The crowd lamented, hoping for clear skies. The Master clenched his teeth and stared vacantly, as if in prayer. Soon, the clouds dispersed and the sun emerged.\n\nIn the afternoon of the fifteenth, a dragon’s tail appeared in the southwest, lingering for some time before vanishing. That night, colored clouds pierced the moon.\n\nOn the twenty-eighth of the fourth month, as he traveled to Zhīyáng, the *hǎishì* reappeared, visible from dawn until noon.\n\nWhen the Master reached the Huíguāng Hermitage, Mǎ Cóngshì joyfully offered to burn a thousand *hú* of grain certificates in repayment. Later, Jūfù gathered fishing nets to burn them, and the *hǎishì* reappeared, faintly resembling a dragon carriage and crane-drawn chariot. Two others, Guō Hēng and Lè Zhōu, also gathered nets to burn, and suddenly, the island of Sāng appeared between them, with battle formations arrayed in shifting ranks—like the array of divine soldiers and armored cavalry.\n\nWhile residing in Huátíng’s humble abode, a *línzhēn* tree stood withered and dead, its branches brittle, its heart rotten, ready to be felled for firewood. On the ninth day of the fourth month, the Master watered it, and soon afterward, his disciple Yáo Xuān arrived with the *jiāpǔ* of Pure Yang True Person. It was then revealed that the tree had been planted on the fourteenth day of the fourth month, when Pure Yang True Person was born beneath it. The Master smiled: *\"I was born on the twentieth of the fifth month—by now, its leaves and branches should have sprouted.\"* He composed a verse:\n\n*\"Thirty-six above, thirty-six below,*\n*Heaven and Earth enter the Treasure Vase,*\n*Seventy-two *hòu* complete the measure.\"*\n\nLi Gōng knelt and begged for an explanation, but the Master laughed: *\"This is a hidden saying—you will understand it in time.\"*\n\nOn the seventeenth of the fifth month, Li Gōng dreamed that the *línzhēn* tree sprouted two leaves on either side. When he awoke and examined it, new shoots had indeed taken root.\n\nBy the time of the Master’s birthday celebration, the branches had grown thick with green shade. Only then did he explain the verse: *\"Four nines make thirty-six days; Heaven and Earth combine for seventy-two days—when *qi* and climate are full, how could decay not turn to flourishing?\"*\n\nAt the Quánzhēn Hermitage, two clumps of bamboo and a pine were transplanted in the fourth month, their leaves withered and yellow. Daoist friend Cuī Gōng asked the Master if they might revive. The Master cheerfully composed two poems:\n\n*\"The Daoist’s gate is called ‘Long Life,’*\n*Yet seeks to reverse decay’s design.*\n*Let these few stalks forever stay green,*\n*No leaf shall dare turn pale or lean.\"*\n\nAnd again:\n\n*\"I master the Law of Life’s rotation,*\n*Shifting *qi* to transform the frame.*\n*Not just the scholar’s bamboo stays green,*\n*Now even the minister’s pine regains its prime.\"*\n\nHe then watered them with his face-washing water, and within a decade, new shoots emerged, their hearts unfolding into leaves.\n\nAt the Jīnyù Hermitage, six small pines were planted on the third day of the sixth month. The crowd knelt and said: *\"The pine and bamboo of Quánzhēn Hermitage have revived—why do these six young pines of Jīnyù wither so?\"*\n\nThe Master then infused them with his true *qi* three times, composing three short poems:\n\n*\"Six pines planted in June’s heat,*\n*Yet return to life like spring’s breeze.*\n*Though my breath is scant, my will is strong—*\n*Six wishes fulfilled, great merit earned.\"*\n\nAnd again:\n\n*\"In past summers, pines were planted,*\n*Daoist friends tested the wind’s might.*\n*I said six would not take root,*\n*Yet fame spreads of the Three-Tufted’s might.\"*\n\n*\"Six pines planted on the third of June,*\n*Their colors changed by the wind’s breath.*\n*I borrow the Double Ninth’s *qi* to pray,*\n*As legend says, the Three-Tufted’s power holds sway.\"*\n\nThe pines did not alter branch or leaf, their verdure lovely beyond compare. The villagers then carved his poems onto stone.\n\nLong ago, Lü Dongbin revived a withered sophora tree in Lái zhōu’s Longxīng Temple with a single pill and a poem, which still stands today. His verse reads:\n\n*\"Long sleeves trailing from my river-bank retreat,*\n*Night lodged in the ancient hall of the *zhī* temple.\"*",

      "translated_text": "Longzhēn Tán Zhēnrén—\nThe Master, surnamed Tán, given name Yù, courtesy name Bóyù, was his ancestral name, residing in Nínghǎi.\nA man of bold generosity, his wisdom and discernment were extraordinary; filial piety and righteousness passed down in his family, highly esteemed by the neighborhood.\nIn the winter of Dīnghài in the Dàdìng era, he suffered from vertigo and paralysis, lingering without relief. Though he consumed many medicines, none took effect.\nHearing of Zhòngyáng Master arriving from Zhōngnán, he, still staying idly at Mǎ Jūn’s residence in Yífǔ, leaned on his cane and went to pay respects, seeking healing methods.\nThe Master refused to admit him at the door, yet he persisted, knocking and calling all night without pause. Suddenly, the door opened on its own.\nZhòngyáng Master rejoiced greatly, deeming him a soul bound by Daoist affinity, and thus invited him to share his bed with Cluán Zhì.\nThey conversed intimately beyond that of old friends. By dawn, his former ailments vanished entirely—his limbs light and nimble, he moved like the wind, only then realizing Zhòngyáng Master’s extraordinary nature.\nHe abandoned wealth and gold as if they were filth, begging to serve at the Master’s side for life without retreat. The Master bestowed upon him a Daoist name: Chǔduān, a courtesy name of Tōngzhèng, and the title of Chángzhēn Zǐ.\nHe gifted a poem:\n*\"Beyond the Pass of Yin-Yang Creation,\nA single heart toward Dao, never turning back.\nThe Pure Way of the Vermilion Court is truly the path of the Immortal,\nOnly settle and cultivate the inner radiance.\"*\n\nOnce the Master received his teachings, he extinguished the self and worldly attachments, abandoned all thoughts, wore a green headband, and donned coarse linen robes.\nIn the year Wùzǐ of the Dàdìng era, he bade farewell to relatives and neighbors, following his Master’s side, and journeyed south to Biāngliáng.\nHe attended morning and evening, gaining much of the Mysterious Dao’s essence.\nBy the third year, his Master ascended to the Celestial Court upon the clouds, and he returned west to Liú Jiāng with the Master’s remains, burying them with proper rites.\nAfterward, he withdrew to the region between Yī and Luò, refining his spirit and cultivating his *qi*.\nThough he lingered in places of old red roads and purple paths, flower-lined groves, and wine-soaked battlefields, his heart remained as motionless as earth and wood.\nNot even ten thousand taels of gold could make him bend his waist.\nHe drifted until reaching Shuǐnán’s Celestial Court Palace, where Lǎngrán Zǐ had refined his elixir.\nThus, he cherished the place and never left.\nLater, when crowds gathered at the gate, he alone begged for food without cease.\nOnce passing through Zhāotí, he sought remnants of food from a Zen master, who flew into a rage and struck him with a fist, breaking two teeth.\nThe Master swallowed the blood with composure, while onlookers sought to intervene—yet he smiled and bowed, utterly unmoved.\nFrom then on, his fame spread through Jīngluò.\n\nHe had always loved the characters **龟 (guī)** and **蛇 (shé)**, practicing their forms tirelessly until his brushwork reached a divine state,\nas if the strokes themselves could soar and transform.\nDevoted Daoist disciples collected and treasured them as precious relics.\nLater, when a fire consumed his estate and spread to a hundred households, only those who kept these two characters remained unharmed.\n\nOne day, he instructed his disciples:\n*\"Zhòngyáng Master and I have a pact with Pénglái—now he departs!\"*\nAs he spoke, five-colored auspicious clouds swirled around the courtyard, and green cranes and white storks soared in and out.\nThen, he bound his hair and faced south, resting his arm as a pillow, and shed his mortal frame on the first day of the fourth month.\n\nHis secular songs and compositions numbered nearly hundreds, titled *Shuǐyún*—\ndeeply mastering the Dao of **铅 (qiān)** and **汞 (gǒng)**, and the **沂 (Yí) River’s flow**.\nHe practiced widely in the world.\n\nThe eulogy says:\n*\"The aged Daoist Immortal of Longzhēn,\nA bold warrior of Nínghǎi,\nShared studies with the Three-Topknot Master,\nAnd knelt before Zhòngyáng to receive his oath.\nOne night’s conversation left unfinished,\nA decade’s madness instantly cured.\nHe scorned a thousand gold pieces,\nAnd hung his hundred *nà* robes with glad poverty.\nRefining *qi* and calming spirit,\nHe wandered for years beneath Luò’s skies,\nReturning to his roots and fulfilling his destiny—\nHalf his life spent never crossing back to Shāndōng.\nTaming a hundred demons with hidden form,\nThe two characters **龟 (guī)** and **蛇 (shé)**—\nSeizing the Two Principles in his grasp,\nThe Nine Return of Dragon and Tiger.\nJust as the fragrant osmanthus bloomed,\nAnd the golden lotus shone resplendent.\n**铅 (qiān)** and **汞 (gǒng)** inscribed in the *Shuǐyún* collection,\nSmoke and mist as his playful retreat in Pénghuái.\nIf not for bones and flesh ascending together,\nAnd form and spirit both attaining transcendence—\nWho could match this Master?\"*\n\nZhang Shéntóng’s poem:\n*\"A heart of iron against wind and fire,\nA true hero who embraces the Dao’s return.\nIn spring’s warmth, his spirit wanders in Luòyáng,\nStill holding the **龟 (guī)** and **蛇 (shé)** talismans in the north.\nThe Master of True Longevity, Liú Zhēnrén—\nA descendant of the Eastern Sea’s golden lineage,\nA remnant of the Han’s illustrious virtue,\nGraceful as clouds, majestic as peaks,\nNoble as the essence of Yùe’s mountains,\nVast as the lakes—his depth and brilliance cannot be contained by stars or constellations.\nHis ancestors and forefathers dwelled in Wǔguān,\nCherishing hidden virtue, delighting in bestowing kindness,\nRelieving the cold and hungry, benefiting orphans and the aged,\nDonating eighty acres of fertile land to Lóngxīng’s grand monastery,\nAs the eternal root for nurturing blessings.\nIn the era of Tàipíng Xīngguó,\nThe court praised his filial piety and righteousness,\nHonoring his family with banners,\nExempting them from taxes and levies—\nHis virtue shone across neighboring counties.\nHeaven did not forsake the virtuous—\nFrom the Vermilion Cloud and Golden Landscape,\nIt selected his refined immortal essence,\nAnd bestowed auspicious signs upon Yèchéng.\nThough he stood apart from the world,\nHe reverently served his widowed mother,\nRenowned for his filial devotion,\nSwearing never to wed or seek office,\nDisdaining fame and wealth,\nGuarding his purity like a simpleton,\nThe affairs of the world could not shake his steadfast sincerity.\nHe repeatedly declined his ancestral home,\nAspiring to seek the extraordinary—\nYet his compassionate mother’s longing held him back.\nIn the spring of Jǐchǒu in the Dàdìng era,\nHe suddenly saw two verses inscribed on his neighbor’s wall—\nIn places no one else could reach—\nThe ink still fresh, no name left behind.\nThe final lines read:\n*'In Wǔguān, the land of True Nature’s cultivation,\nThere must be one who achieves immortal longevity without death.'*\nThe Master delighted in the bold and forceful strokes,\nSuspecting they were the work of a divine being,\nYet he could not confirm their meaning.\nThat autumn, in the ninth month,\nWith frost and dew in the air,\nZhòngyáng Master, leaning on his staff and sandals,\nJourneyed westward, gathering the three Immortals—\nTán, Liú, and Mǎ—\nCrossing the sea island, traversing the mountain city.\nThe Master heard of it and hurried with devotion,\nOffering incense and fire to welcome him.\nZhòngyáng Master turned and smiled:\n*'Do you recognize the ink on the wall?'*\"",

were the work of a divine being,\nYet could not verify their meaning.\n\nThat autumn, in the ninth month,\nWith frost and dew in the air,\nZhòngyáng Master, leaning on his staff and sandals,\nJourneyed westward, gathering the three Immortals—\nTán, Liú, and Mǎ—\nCrossing the sea island, traversing the mountain city.\nThe Master heard of it and hurried with devotion,\nOffering incense and fire to welcome him.\nZhòngyáng Master turned and smiled:\n*\"Do you recognize the ink on the wall?\"*\n\nThe three disciples also exchanged glances and chilly smiles,\nThen realized the verses were divine manifestations meant to startle them.\nThey thus carved their sincerity into their very bones,\nPledged their loyalty with unyielding resolve,\nCarrying their stools and staffs,\nHolding their towels and bottles,\nObeying his every command,\nLetting life and death follow his will.\nThe Master, moved by their earnestness,\nAdmired their single-minded dedication,\nAnd their extraordinary aura beyond mortal kind,\nExclaimed with a sigh:\n*\"In the month of pine, beneath the snow of bamboo,\nI have no need for the yellow dust of the world.\"*\n\nHe composed a poem in reply:\n*\"After casting my line, I return to see the tortoise,\nNow knowing my fate—ranked among the celestial Immortals.*\n*The crane and the fish call to each other, understanding my intent,\nRising from the waves a thousand feet high.*\n*Taking the verses’ meaning to heart,\nI name ‘Longevity’ as my title,\n‘Mystic’ as my surname,\n‘Penetrating Marvel’ as my given character—*\n*At the time, I was but a year past my twentieth spring.*\n*The names of Qióu, Liú, Tán, and Mǎ filled the Nine Wilds and Eight Strings,*\n*Traveling in Biānlíng, dwelling at Yímén,*\n*Begging for alms to refine my form,*\n*Hiding my true name in obscurity,*\n*Knocking at dawn, pleading at dusk,*\n*Sitting in steaming incense, walking in perfumed smoke,*\n*Skillfully unraveling the profound mysteries,*\n*Diligently expounding the sacred texts,*\n*Clearing away illusions like clouds,*\n*Dispelling delusions like mist.*\n\n*The Master, having fully imparted the Four Symbols and Five Elements,*\n*Then departed, leaving his mortal vessel behind,*\n*Retreating into heaven—*\n*As the saying goes: ‘Finding a true friend, he ascends to Pénglái.’*\n*The four disciples carried their Immortal bodies,*\n*Repaying his boundless grace,*\n*Knocking at Xiànyáng, passing through Huáyīn,*\n*Calming their spirits in the radiant glow of Liú Jiāng’s former hall.*\n*Though each had different aspirations,*\n*The Master alone concealed his traces in Luòjīng,*\n*Refined his nature amid the dust of the world,*\n*Nurtured his purity in the chaotic hum of the marketplace,*\n*Where neither music nor flowers could distract his harmony,*\n*Nor the pleasures of life perturb his clarity.*\n*His heart grew colder with each passing day,*\n*His body stilled like wood in winter.*\n\n*When others worked, he ate without complaint,*\n*When none asked, his face remained unruffled,*\n*When questioned, he answered with a gesture,*\n*When left alone, his silence was absolute.*\n*His willpower was flawless,*\n*His inner light radiant as heaven.*\n*He then moved to the banks of Yúnxī,*\n*And his disciples carved a cave dwelling into the rocky slopes.*\n*Suddenly, he encountered an ancient well with cold, clear water,*\n*The crowd astonished by its strangeness,*\n*The Master laughing said:*\n*'Just a few steps away, there are two more wells—*\n*They are the places where I cultivated in past lives.'*\n*When dug, they were indeed found,*\n*And to this day, the cave is called the ‘Three Wells.’*\n\n*In the Year of the Ram (Dìngshēn),*\n*He returned to Wǔguān,*\n*To pay respects to his mother,*\n*Their reunion filled with joy.*\n*He chose a site beneath the shadow of Tàojī,*\n*And built the Hall of Lingxū,*\n*Planting cypress trees with his own hands,*\n*Their verdant rows stretching into the distance.*\n*Soon after, the local villagers falsely accused him of murder,*\n*And he went without protest to be bound.*\n*He endured the slander of the fox-trapers for nearly ten weeks.*\n\n*Pure Yang Master, hearing the water clock,*\n*Riding the Azure Unicorn,*\n*Descending from the Azure Sky,*\n*Entering the Mystic Realm,*\n*Meeting at Liǔwěi,*\n*Commissioned him to study under Guǎnchéng,*\n*And taught him the art of calligraphy.*\n*Later, the murderer confessed himself,*\n*And the Master was spared the punishment of imprisonment.*\n\n*When he emerged,*\n*His brushwork was divine,*\n*With dragons and serpents leaping from the ink.*\n*In the Year of the Great Peace (Dàdìng),*\n*He presided over the grand ritual at Chāngyáng,*\n*Where colorful clouds veiled the altar,*\n*And white cranes danced in the courtyard.*\n*That year, the autumn drought scorched the land,*\n*Yet he earnestly prayed for rain.*\n*Standing upon the ritual platform,*\n*He looked around and saw no clouds,*\n*Then said:*\n*'By the hour of the cock tomorrow,*\n*There will be sweet, heavy rain as if from a flood.'*\n*His words proved true,*\n*Like echoes responding to sound and form.*\n\n*Afterward, whenever he led the grand rituals in Shùzhōu,*\n*There was always a blessed wind that swirled,*\n*Rising to carry the paper offerings aloft,*\n*His influence as divine as the heavens,*\n*To this day, the stone inscriptions remain in every district.*\n\n*In the third year of Chéng’ān,*\n*The Emperor Zhāng heard of his Dao’s worth,*\n*And sent envoys to summon him,*\n*With a tortoise-shaped boat and a reed mat,*\n*To escort him to the Purple Palace,*\n*Treating him as a honored guest,*\n*Granting him the surname ‘Lín’*\n*And the name ‘Xiūzhēn.’*\n*The officials and commoners came in endless procession,*\n*His doorstep never empty.*\n\n*The following spring, in the third month,*\n*He begged to return to his native mountain,*\n*The Emperor, unable to refuse,*\n*Bestowed the title ‘Língxū’*\n*And honored his ancestral hall.*\n\n*On the auspicious day of the sixth month,*\n*In the Year of the Ox (Gǔihài),*\n*Drums were beaten and the crowd gathered,*\n*And he announced his journey to the Board of Literature.*\n*Leaning on his left arm,*\n*He returned to True Nature,*\n*His radiance enveloping the heavens,*\n*His sacred qi swirling in auspicious patterns.*\n*All his remaining works—*\n*The ‘Music of the Immortals,’ ‘Great Void,’ ‘Swirling Yang,’ ‘Mingling with Dust,’ ‘Serene Ease,’ ‘Perfecting the True’—*\n*Still expound the ‘Dao Dé,’*\n*Interpret the ‘Yīnfú,’*\n*And elucidate the ‘Huángtíng.’*\n*His insights delve into the depths of truth,*\n*His teachings reveal the sacred essence,*\n*Sufficient as a guide for all ages to come.*\n\n*The praise reads:*\n*\"The Old Immortal of Longevity,\nProclaims the transformation of authority,\nSwallows the Void, spits out Nature,\nRiding the purple clouds to descend and wander—\nAt the edge of the Azure Sea,\nMeeting the cosmic cycle of the Heavenly Stem and Earthly Branch,\nBinding with Pure Yang across countless kalpas.*\n*He strikes the hundred barriers,*\n*Pierces the Nine Abysses,*\n*Drives the Four Beasts,*\n*Tills the Three Fields,*\n*Sits in the marketplace of Luòyáng,*\n*Carves out the Celestial Cavern of Yúnxī.*\n*Melting white snow into powder,*\n*Refining black frost without smoke.*\n*His fame resounds in Fèngzhōu,*\n*His glory shines in Jīnlián.*\n*He builds the hall of Linglú,*\n*Bows to the imperial edict,*\n*And then settles the ancient debt of Shù-Lài,*\n*Only then do flesh and spirit reunite,*\n*Feasting and reveling in the Eight Extremes.\"*\n\n*Zhāng Shéntóng’s poem reads:*\n*\"Deep within the Penglai peaks, the truth is revealed,\nA single spark of clarity piercing the dust.*\n*After ascending beyond the winds of Shù,*\n*Lingxū quietly seals the spring in its jade hall.\"*\n\n---\n\n**Long Spring Qióu Zhēnren**\nZhēnren’s surname was Qióu, given name Chǔjī.\nHe was called **Long Spring Child**.\nHis family lineage traced back to Qīxiá,\nWhere they were most

      "translated_text": "The following day, the imperial envoy presented a tray of peaches. The Master had abstained from tea and fruit for over ten years, yet out of the emperor’s boundless grace, he reluctantly ate one.\n\nBy the Mid-Autumn Festival, he received the edict to return to the mountains, and was further granted ten thousand strings of cash, which he respectfully declined.\n\nIn the year *Jiǎyǒu*, the second month, the imperial carriage departed from Yàn Tái. Upon reaching the *Guān Shǎn* region, news of the emperor’s passing arrived. The Master sighed and said: *\"Alas! The great matter of life and death—though one holds the highest rank, possesses all under Heaven, yet cannot escape the hundred years’ span. How is this possible?\"* Thus, he resolved to return westward.\n\nCrossing *Hán Gǔ Pass*, passing through *Zhōngnán Mountains*, he traveled according to local customs, spreading the *Mysterious Teaching*, which flourished wherever he went.\n\nWhen the era was renamed *Míngchāng*, he returned eastward to the seaside, taking refuge at Qíxiá, where he constructed altars and halls.\n\nBy the year *Wùchén*, his reputation soared, his name known throughout the land. The emperor honored him, renaming his abode *Tàixū Guān* and bestowing six thousand volumes of *Xuándū Bǎozàng* as perpetual offerings.\n\nNot long after, war raged across the *Héshuò* frontier. Envoys from Sòng and Jin, each bearing imperial decrees, arrived simultaneously. The Great Mongols of the northern lands also sent *Liú Zhònglù* with their own proclamation. All assumed the Master would journey south, for the southern lands revered the *Way* deeply, while the north was steeped in slaughter—besides, the languages were incomprehensible.\n\nYet the Master said nothing. He selected eighteen disciples worthy of the journey and, with *Liú Zhònglù*, set westward.\n\nPassing through *Jì*, reaching *Déyù Fǔ*, he lodged at *Lóngyáng Guān*. He sent a poem to his friends in Yànjīng:\n\n*\"Ten years of war and fire bring sorrow to the people,*\n*Yet scarcely one or two survive a thousand.*\n*Last year, by fortune, I received the merciful edict,*\n*This spring, I must brave the cold to depart.*\n*I do not shun the three thousand *lǐ* of northern peaks,*\n*Yet still I ponder the two hundred eastern prefectures.*\n*In dire straits, the condemned gasp for breath—*\n*Let me teach them how to ease their woes.\"*\n\nCrossing the *Bái Gǔ Tián*, where cold winds and piled snow bit into the bones, he endured countless hardships. He composed a long poem in ancient style to record their journey:\n\n*\"East of Jīnshān, west of Yīnshān,*\n*Ten thousand cliffs and gorges pierce the deep ravines.*\n*Chaotic rocks block the path beyond,*\n*No wheel or hoof has ever passed since ancient times.*\n*Two years past, the Second Prince raised armies,*\n*Built bridges to span the rushing waters.*\n*Now my *Way* seeks to journey westward,*\n*Again the clamor of chariots and horses passes here.*\n*Silver peaks, iron walls rise ten thousandfold,*\n*Each vying in grandeur, boasting of their might.*\n*When the sun rises, the sea below seems near,*\n*When the moon shines, it connects with the Milky Way.*\n*Heaven-piercing pines stand straight as writing brushes,*\n*Towering, swaying—over a hundred *zhàng* tall.*\n*Ten thousand stalks lean close, dark and dense,*\n*Yet not a crow caws—only empty silence.*\n*The winding *Yángqiāng* presses *Mèngmén* against *Tàiháng*,\n*Yet this mountain’s grandeur is still but commonplace.*\n*Double chariots climb and descend with labored steps,*\n*Hundreds of horsemen before and behind, all in alarm.*\n*The *Tiānchí* sea lies atop the mountain,*\n*A hundred *lǐ* mirroring the boundless world.*\n*Cars halt, horses descend the western slope,*\n*Forty-eight bridges stretch low over ten thousand *zhàng*.*\n*From the southern river to the northern sea, the mountains are endless,*\n*In endless change, their forms remain the same.*\n*Yet none compare to this mountain’s supreme oddity—*\n*Its rugged, towering peaks seem wrought by divine craft.*\n*When I arrived, it was the eighth or ninth month,*\n*Yet half the mountain was already snow.*\n*Before the mountain, grass and trees warm as spring,*\n*Behind it, my robes stiffen like iron.*\n*Westward, I traveled ten thousand *lǐ*—*\n*The mountains, rivers, strange men, and marvelous beasts*\n*I saw were far different from those of the Central Kingdom.*\n\nAt that time, *Chéngjísī* the Emperor still held *Suàn Dān*, not yet descending. The envoy *Liú Zhònglù* presented the Master to him. The Emperor greeted him warmly: *\"Other kingdoms’ summons go unanswered, yet you have crossed ten thousand *lǐ* to come here. I greatly honor this.\"*\n\nThe Master replied: *\"The mountains and wilderness rise in response to the imperial edict—this is the will of Heaven, not the work of man.\"*\n\nThe Emperor offered him food. After eating, he asked: *\"Master, having traveled so far, do you possess any elixir of longevity to bestow upon me?\"*\n\nThe Master said: *\"I have only the *Way* of preserving life, not an elixir of immortality.\"*\n\nThe Emperor admired his sincerity. From then on, he summoned the Master daily, urging him to reduce slaughter and curb desires. Their conversations spanned thousands of words. *Yēlǜ Jìnqīng*, then a minister, recorded them in *Xuānfēng Qìnghuì Lù*. The Emperor believed and followed them all.\n\nThe Emperor asked *Zhèn Hǎi*: *\"By what title should the Master be addressed?\"*\n\n*Zhèn Hǎi* replied: *\"Some honor him as *Fùshī*, others as *Zhēnrén*, still others as *Shénxiān*.\"*\n\nThe Emperor decreed: *\"From this day forward, let him be called *Shénxiān*.\"*\n\nIn the spring of *Guǐwǔ*, at the emperor’s command, he was escorted back to Yànjīng by thousands of armored cavalry. *Tiāncháng Guān* was renamed *Chángchūn Gōng*, and *Báiyún Guān* was rebuilt, merging them into one. The *Nán Gōng Wànsuì Shān* and *Tàiyè Chí* were also granted to him, renamed *Wàn’ān Gōng*. The edict commanded all virtuous recluses in the land to join him, and he was given a *jīnhǔ fú* seal to act as he saw fit. Over time, he received countless imperial decrees.\n\nThe Master, now overseeing *Chángchūn Gōng*, saw the *Quánzhēn Way* flourish. Leading rituals to invoke winds and rain, his predictions never failed—like echoes and shadows. Ten thousand households turned to him.\n\nIn his leisure, after the noon repast, he would ride with a few attendants to *Wàn’ān Gōng*, enjoying the wealth of *Cāoshān Xī*, the evening rest of joyful birds and fish. He visited daily, returning only as dusk fell.\n\nIn the sixth month of the year *Dīnghài*, on the twenty-third day, he fell ill and did not leave his quarters. When messengers inquired at the *wǔ* hour, a sudden storm erupted. The southern bank of *Tàiyè Chí* collapsed, flooding into the *Dōng Hú*, its roar heard for tens of *lǐ*. The *diàn’áo yúguī* vanished, and the pool dried up. The northern cliff of the mountain crumbled on its own.",

      "translated_text": "The Master, upon hearing this, laughed and said: *\"The mountain crumbles, the pool dries—shall I depart with them?\"*\n\nOn the fourth day of the seventh month, the Master told his disciples: *\"Long ago, Dan Yang once foretold to me: 'After my passing, the Dao will flourish greatly, and the four quarters will transform into Daoic lands. You shall be there at that time, presiding over the great observatories, all bestowed with official titles and seals, with envoys bearing symbols and riding in official carriages. This is the moment when one’s merit is complete, one’s name established, and it is time to rest in retirement.' Dan Yang’s words have all come true—I return with no regrets.\"*\n\nHaving declared his illness, on the ninth day, just after noon, he ascended to the *Bǎoxuān Táng* and left behind this verse:\n\n*\"Life and death are but morning and evening—\nA fleeting bubble, a laborer in the river’s flow.\nWhere faint light flickers, the hare and tortoise leap,\nWhen profound measure opens, mountains and seas are embraced.\nStrumming the eight strings as though within arm’s reach,\nBlowing the void into forms like a mechanism’s play.\nMad verses spill like dust beneath the pen,\nLeft for the age to mock and question in vain.\"*\n\nHe then returned to the *Bǎoguāng Táng*, where he transformed with vibrant grace—like a butterfly emerging.\n\nAt that moment, a *qīngluán* crane and a white heron circled above and below, auspicious vapors filled the air, and celestial melodies swirled before he ascended into the sky. Officials and commoners alike knelt in reverence, and his remains were enshrined in the *Shùn Táng* of the *Báiyún Guàn*.\n\nThree years later, when his coffin was opened, his robes were found unchanged, his limbs soft as silk, his complexion as if alive. All his works—songs, essays, letters, treatises, plain speech, and recorded sayings—collected as *Mófēixī Jí*, *Wūdào Jí*, and *Xīyóu Jì*, numbering thousands—circulated in the world.\n\nThe *Xuěfēng* eulogy reads:\n\n*\"The heavens and earth as hall and chamber,\nThe sun and moon as lamps and candles.\nAn old immortal of the *Lóuxiá* peak,\nRising and setting within the *Zhōngsù* hostel.\nBefore the assembly, he spoke of Heaven’s ways,\nHis words like ice and jade in flight.\nUnlocking the Dao’s subtle mechanisms,\nHe silently enjoyed the lofty celestial rewards.\nHis divine refinement—how pure and clear,\nHis radiance dazzling both eyes.\nHis rising form—how light and swift,\nHealthy winds stirring his sturdy feet.\nThe Dao flourishes or fades,\nYet all hearts bow in submission.\nThe Golden Elixir—finished or not,\nWhite clouds fill the valleys and peaks.\"*\n\nThe eulogy continues:\n\n*\"I once visited the *Yāntái*, where three men debated the merits of Master Qiu Xian of the Yellow Peak. One said: 'I say his greatest virtue was seven years of toil at Fǎnshuǐ Xi, and years of radiance in the *Bǎoxuān Táng*, laying the foundation for refining the Golden Elixir and planting the Fire Plum and Exchange Pear trees. He entered dreams as spirit, turned earth and heaven—this was his greatest virtue.'\n\nAnother replied: 'No. I say his greatest virtue was establishing observatories, teaching and guiding people, opening the full-bloom lotus of the *Quánzhēn*, and planting the shadowless three-flowered tree. Half the world wore the official cap, and all spoke of the Dao in leisure—none failed to drink from the *Chóngxuān*, all were touched by the utmost transformation. This was his greatest virtue.'\n\nThe third said: 'Both of you see only the small, grasp only the partial. You take half a fist of *Tàishān* and a leaf from *Děnglín*—you miss the whole.\n\nI say: When the Mongol armies swept south, their horses drank the Yellow River nearly dry, their arrows made *Huàyuè* tremble, and both precious and base were burned, the wise and foolish slaughtered. Corpses piled like mountains, blood like seas—thunderous might, merciless as a tiger. Fortunately, Master Chángchūn Qiu Xian arose at the emperor’s summons. With one audience, the dragon’s wrath eased; with a second, Heaven’s will turned. Those who surrendered were spared, cities that fell were pardoned, conscripts were ransomed, captives set free. Four hundred districts gained peace, tens of thousands of miles received grace. He stretched his arms to block the collapsing peaks, lay his body to dam the flooding river—saving lives from the boiling cauldron, snatching souls from the executioner’s blade.

structure and frame [骨格非凡], and asked:\n*\"Would you allow me, humble one, to follow you?\"*\nThe Master replied:\n*\"This is my deepest wish—how could I dare refuse your command?\"* [仆所愿也，敢不唯命]\n\nThus, he served at the Master’s side,\nand with **Qiū Zhēnren**, **Liú Zhēnren**, **Tán Zhēnren**, and **Mǎ Zhēnren**,\nthey became **unfailing friends** [莫逆之交].\nIn their pursuit of **Daoist refinement and hidden precepts** [修真秘诀],\nthey exhausted every inquiry without restraint.\n\nThe Master called him and said:\n*\"The **Yún Guāng Cave** [云光洞] in **Tiěchá Mountain** [铁查山],

character exists in the **Middle Pinyin** [篇韵中本],\nfor the Master had composed it himself.\nThe surname *\"Chǔyī\"* was written as *\"七\"* (seven),\nsymbolizing the **seven golden lotuses** [金莲七朵].\n\nApproximately, the place where the parasol was cast\nwas **two hundred lǐ** distant from the **Yún Guāng Cave** [云光洞].\n\nThe Master received it,\nand later returned to thank him.\nThe

[卜筮之数], and never let go of the **Yellow Old** [黄老] and **Zhuangzi’s** [庄] teachings.\n\nWhenever he encountered secluded groves and quiet streams, he would linger there, forgetting the return home until day’s end.\nIn the autumn of **Dīnghài** [丁亥, 1167] in the **Dàdìng** [大定] era, he sold divinations in the marketplace,\nwhile scholars and officials gathered around him in

**Hè** was startled and quickly rose to pay respects,\nthen invited **Zhòngyáng** to another place for leisurely conversation.\nTheir exchanges flowed like stones dropped into water—\nquick, resonant, and profound.\nMaster **Hè** presented a poem:\n*\"The gentlemen at my side delight in the **Way of Tàigǔ** [太古],\nyet they still seek the **Unseen Path of Black and White** [黑白希夷路].\nToday, I meet a

[丘] at his side.\nAfter a few days, **Zhòngyáng** sent **Qiū** [丘] to summon **Master Hè** [太古].\nWhen he arrived, **Zhòngyáng** said,\n*\"I have cut the sleeves of my robe in two—\nI need them to patch my back,\nso you may wear them for winter.\nI will mend my own sleeves afterward.\"*\nMaster **Hè** bowed in acceptance—\na **symbol of the ancient transmission of the robe** [传衣之法].\n\nAfter

suddenly understood **Zhòngyáng’s** hidden words,\nand his mind opened like water released from a dam.\nHe then sat silently on a bridge,\nneither seeking food nor complaining of hunger or cold,\naccepting alms only when offered,\nand enduring insults without anger—\nhis resolve was to **forget the form** [忘形].\nThus, for three years, people called him **Silent Master** [不语先生].\n\nOne night, the sky darkened, and a drunken passerby,\nmistaking his stillness for weakness,\nkicked Master **Hè** into the river below the bridge.\nHe remained motionless for seven days,\nand none knew where he had gone.\nA traveler’s horse suddenly reared and refused to move forward,\nthough he beat it relentlessly.\nThe traveler dismounted and asked his attendants,\n*\"There must be some strange matter beneath this bridge—\notherwise, why would my horse be so alarmed?\"*\nHe ordered them to investigate,\nand they found a **Daoist** [道者] sitting quietly in the darkness.\nWhen questioned, he did not speak,\nbut traced the earth with his hand and said,\n*\"I have not eaten for seven days.\"*\nThe townsfolk heard this,\nrushed to offer him food,\nand begged him to emerge.\nYet he only shook his head in refusal,\nand sat there another three years—\n**water and fire inverted** [水火颠倒], **yin and yang harmonized** [阴阳和合].\nHis **Nine Transformations** [九转] were complete.\n\nThen, he rose and departed,\nhis staff and sandals striking northward,\nlingering in **Zhēndìng** [真定] and its environs,\nwhere countless seekers came to learn from him.\nHe established **Daoist halls** [宫观] and

Skilled in calligraphy and literature, she excelled particularly in **poetic compositions** [昤咏].\n\nWhen she became a widow, she married into the **Mǎ** [马] family and bore three sons, all of whom she instructed in **moral and medicinal arts** [义方].\n\nIn the winter of **Dīnghài** [丁亥] in the **Dàdìng** [大定] era, **Zhòngyáng Lǎoshī** [重阳先生] arrived from **Zhōngnán** [终南]. **Mǎ Yí Fǔ** [马宜甫] treated him with great hospitality, but the maiden did not fully trust him. She confined the master within her **hermitage** [庵] for over a hundred days, providing neither food nor drink, and only glimpsed him through the gate. Yet his complexion and bearing surpassed even his usual state, and only then did she embrace his teachings with faith.\n\nEven afterward, the maiden would **manifest divine forms** [神入梦] in dreams and visions, terrifying him with depictions of **hellish realms** [地狱] and enticing him with visions of **heavenly paradises** [天堂]. She bestowed upon him **ten divisions of alms** [十度分梨] and **six rounds of taro gifts** [六番赐芋], and thus **Mǎ Yí Fǔ** followed her as a disciple, entering the **Dao** [道]. Yet the maiden’s affection for her sons lingered, and she hesitated, waiting another year before finally abandoning them—**clad in bamboo hat and coarse robe** [竹冠布袍]—and journeying to the **Golden Lotus Hall** [金莲堂] of her native state to pay homage to **Zhòngyáng Lǎoshī** and seek **initiation** [度].\n\nThe master bestowed upon her a poem:\n*\"Ten alms of divided fruit were given last year,\nHeaven’s timing was ever natural, no need to fear.\nWhy did you not then depart from mortal ties?\nAh, you waited only to pluck the Golden Lotus.\"*\n\nHe further bestowed upon her a **Daoist name** [法名], **Bù Èr** [不二], and a **Daoist title** [道号], **Qīngjìng Sǎnrén** [清静散人]. He instructed her in the **mystic seals of the Celestial Talisman** [天符云篆], granting her the **secret precepts** [秘诀] alone.\n\nWhen **Zhòngyáng Lǎoshī** later passed away in **Bìngliáng** [汴梁] and his remains were returned to **Zhōngnán** [终南] for burial, carried by **Qiū** [丘], **Liú** [刘], **Tán** [谭], and **Mǎ** [马], the maiden heard of it and set out westward, **ascending clouds and crossing moons** [穿云度月], **sleeping in frost and enduring snow** [外雪眠霜], disfiguring her form yet not feeling the pain. By the **first month of Rénchén** [壬辰] spring, she arrived at **Zhào Pénglái’s** [赵蓬莱] residence in **Jīngzào** [京兆], where she met **Dānyáng** [丹阳]. Together, they **shared profound insights** [参同妙旨] and **delved into the depths of Daoist principles** [转涉理窟].\n\n**Dānyáng** then bestowed upon her the **Elixir Refining Sand** [《炼丹砂》]:\n*\"Serve the maiden of Fùchūn* [富春姑],\nDo not follow me blindly—\nNow you are neither woman nor man.\nEach must refine their own **true essence** [真面目],\nEscape the **Three Defilements** [三涂],\nAnd **cultivate the Dao’s qi** [炼气]—do not let the **Hall of Elixir** [厅] deceive you.\nAbove and below, all is **expansive ease** [宽舒],\nEndless as the **mystic breath of the cosmos** [绵绵似有却如无].\nWrap yourself in **embodied purity** [个裹灵童],\n**Harmonize the vital forces** [调引动],\nAnd you shall reach the **Daoist capital** [仙都].\"\n\nThe maiden accepted this with gratitude and parted, each traveling to their own place to **refine the heart within humble walls** [炼心环堵]. Seven years later, her **Three Fields** [三田] were restored, and her **hundred orifices** [百窍] flowed freely.\n\nThen she arose and set out, wandering through **Luòyáng** [洛阳], **guiding and transforming** [劝化接引] and **initiating many disciples** [度人甚多]. One day, she inscribed the **Divination Song** [卜算子]:\n*\"With firm resolve, she clutches her robe and waits,\nAs **water and fire** [水火] merge in ceaseless embrace.\nA million **Daoist paths** [万道] bloom in the **sea of luminous qi** [霞光海底],\nA single strike pierces the **Three Passes** [一撞三关].\n**Celestial music** [仙乐] resounds repeatedly,\nEver drinking the **fermented Daoist wine** [酝酬酒].\nNo need to ask for **wondrous elixirs** [妙药] in every fleeting moment—\nThe **Nine Transformations’ Elixir Sand** [九转丹砂] is complete.\"*\n\nUpon finishing, she told her disciples:\n*\"The master’s **true essence** [真] has its **preordained vow** [约],\nEach must now return to the **Jade Pool** [瑶池].\nMy **Daoist term** [仙期] has arrived.\"*\n\nShe bathed and changed her clothes, then asked those around her:\n*\"How early or late is the **heavenly hour** [天气]?\"*\nThey replied:\n*\"It is high noon.\"*\nShe then **assumed the lotus posture** [结踟趺], sat **serene and upright** [奄然端坐], and **entered the Dao’s natural state** [处顺]. Her visage remained as if alive, and **fragrant breezes** [香风] filled the room. **Auspicious qi** [瑞气] swirled about, descending over the fields, never dispersing throughout the day. This occurred on the **twenty-ninth day of the twelfth month in Rényuán** [壬寅年十二月二十九日].\n\nAt that very time, **Dānyáng** resided within the **Nínghǎi** [宁海] hermitage, gazing upward. He saw the maiden ascending on **five-colored auspicious clouds** [五色祥云], drifting gracefully in the sky, and she spoke to him with a smile:\n*\"I have already returned to **Penglai** [蓬莱] ahead of you.\"*\n\n**Dānyáng**, hearing this, **swept his robes aside** [拂衣] and danced in celebration, composing the **\"Drunken Daoist’s Order\"** [《醉仙令》] to rejoice in his own attainment. The **eulogy** [赞] reads:\n\n*\"Lofty is the name **Bù Èr** [不二],\nGreat is the **cultivation of Oneness** [守一功].\nDescended from the **Fùchūn** [富春] clan,\nBorn into the **Zhōngshàng** [忠翔] family,\nPaired with **Dānyáng’s** transcendent talent [超世之才],\nAnd nurtured by **Nínghǎi’s** half-state [半州之产].\nSevering love, she cast aside her three sons at once,\nAnd **entered the Mystic** [投玄] to worship **Zhòngyáng** [重阳].\nDisfiguring her radiant form to cross westward to **Zhōngnán** [终南],\nEnduring wind and frost to depart from the **sea’s embrace** [海上].\nSeven years within humble walls,\nShe refined the **Nine Transformations’ Elixir Sand** [九转丹砂],\nAnd with a single **true utterance** [一句真诠],\nPierced the **Three Passes’ orthodox path** [三关正路].\nSix times she gave taro,\nTen times she divided fruit—\nShe planted **karmic seeds beyond the ages** [劫外之因绿],\nAnd returned the **transformation within the Elixir Field** [壶中造化].\nShe **nurtured the Daoist embryo** [养胎仙] while her heart wandered freely,\nAnd **shed her mortal husk** [委蜕壳] to arrive at **Penglai** [蓬莱].\nGreat indeed, marvelous indeed—\nShe alone **shared a single Golden Lotus** [独分一朵之金莲],\nAnd **attained a place among the Seven True Ones** [得预七真之仙列].\"*\n\n**Zhāng Shéntóng** [张神童] composed a poem:\n*\"Washed clean of rouge, her cheeks glow like twin clouds,\nTen years’ toil cultivated the **Golden Elixir’s seed** [黄芽].\nWith attainment, she strides firm upon the **Azure Crane’s back** [青鸾],\nAnd blooms fully in the **Golden Lotus’s seventh phase** [第七华].\"\n\n**Fifth Volume of the *Golden Lotus Orthodox Lineage*** [金莲正宗记卷之五] concludes.",
