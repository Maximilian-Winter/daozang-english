the Great Dao opens naturally.\n\n**Observing the heart with the heart,**\nPenetrating the ordinary heart, the other heart is likewise known.\nAttaining freedom, vast and bright, illuminating all emptiness.\n\n**Seeing nature with nature,**\nWisdom sees without hindrance, transcending self and other.\nWithout thought, clearly beholding true emptiness.\n\n**The spirit, vast and boundless,**\nHaving attained the numinous and bright,\nSubtle and profound, one with nature.\nAs my guardian, long it does not fall into emptiness.\n\n**The true, profound and infinite,**\nEqual to the flourishing harmony of the void,\nHow could there be distinction in rank?\nGreat or small, thus the true is boundless.\n\n**Perfect in great wisdom,**\nWondrous sight, far-reaching and

observing, my heart is without heart,**\nThoroughly illuminating true wisdom,\nObserving the heart—how could there be a heart?\nReturning to stillness, not a single thought arises.\n\n**Outwardly

without hindrance,\nAt ease, naturally attained.\nAll unbroken, boundless and without limit.\n\n**Ten thousand thoughts return to emptiness,**\nWorldly thoughts are ultimately illusory,\nForgotten, all enter emptiness.\nWith a single thought, the moon shines on the emerald pool.\n\n**Was this not joy?**\nWorldly states and fleeting glory,\nOnly suffice to delight the seven emotions.\nAttaining true nature, joy is beyond naming.\n\n**Entangled in karmic causes,**\nMost of all, karmic conditions weigh heavily,\nPursuing them, transgressions deepen.\nHeavenly nature dims, assailed by the six dusts.\n\n**Clinging to dust and sorrow,**\nLong bound to worldly ties,\nClinging to sorrow harms the great harmony.\nStriving for purity, afflictions only multiply.\n\n**A hundred transformations of the heart—**\nFacing things, it breeds cunning,\nA hundred shifts in the moment.\nAll but an inch—yet enslaved to such depths.\n\n**The soul wanders ten thousand scenes,**\nDreams and fancies topple and invert,\nThe soul drifts through ten thousand scenes.\nIron and flesh—terror lies in the void.\n\n**The spirit races to the realm of craving,**\nThe po is unmoored, the spirit faint,\nThe spirit races to the realm of craving.\nWith wisdom’s awakening, sounds and sights rush to ruin.\n\n**Heavenly truth—**\n**Bearing the spirit in the realm of affliction,**\nTrue nature is drowned,\nAnxieties bear the lone spirit.\nFollowing them at every turn, how can one reach the wondrous source’s court?\n\n**The hun sings, the po dances,**\nThe three luminous visions are spent,\nAll returned to the hun and po’s domain.\nFrom dawn to dusk, song and dance,\nFrolicking toward deceit and depravity.\n\n**Drawn to the path of death,**\nUnwilling to wander the true and upright,\nWillingly entering the path of death.\nThe numinous essence is wholly extinguished,\nThe yin po finds release.\n\n**The mind dulls, perception strays,**\nIntent and discernment both obscured,\nMuddled, dull, and lost.\nThe mountain of passions, the sea of desire—\nNo longer ascending toward truth.\n\n**Turning from the path of life,**\nLight, once shifted to darkness,\nDoes one yet know one has turned from life?\nThe three primals and seven treasures—\nAll seized by the eight perversities.\n\n**Truly pitiable—**\nEntering the realm of non-action,\nTrue essence and the two are alike.\nRound luminosity, vast and boundless,\nThe great virtue attains mysterious penetration.\n\n**Attained at last!**\nReturning from falsehood to cultivate truth,\nThrough truth, entering emptiness once more.\nThis is called true attainment—\nBeyond attainment, no further effort remains.\n\n**The Heart of the Great Void’s Abyss concludes.**",
