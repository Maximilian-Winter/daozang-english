rush—\nwhen the limit arrives, death’s path is inescapable.\nSince ancient times, the Xu and Pang families departed;\nthey too should have escaped the suffering of rebirth.\nYet there exists a lead chamber, a mercury treasury—\na single point of numinous clarity is master.\nThe Dao’s joy is dustless, carefree;\nin delight, one sings and dances the Dao.\nSince ancient times, the Xu and Pang families departed;\nthey too should have escaped the suffering of rebirth.\nRevering the Dao, the exalted perfected protect and shelter,\npreserving life, the body rests in simplicity.\nMalice and filth vanish, deeds cease;\nthe sagely Dao is hard to encounter, hard to meet.\nSince ancient times, the Xu and Pang families departed;\nthey too should have escaped the suffering of rebirth.\n\nThe Dao rescues the nine lineages and seven ancestors—\na path to Penglai lies near at hand.\nThe Three Teachings’ gates of transcendence,\nthe immortal Dao—once met in a thousand years.\n\nSince ancient times, the Xu and Pang families departed;\nthey too should have escaped the suffering of rebirth.\nBeyond the world, immortal palaces and precious realms—\nattaining the Dao, the true and numinous dwell forever.\nSpreading virtue, their names endure through ages;\nwho awakens to save the dying and mourn the living?\n\nSince ancient times, the Xu and Pang families departed;\nthey too should have escaped the suffering of rebirth.\nGrand offerings deliver departed souls, sagely salvation—\nin drought, the rare Dharma-rain is hard to meet.\nWith purity, body and mind feast on simplicity;\nmerit perfected, the immortal path is complete.\n\nSince ancient times, the Xu and Pang families departed;\nthey too should have escaped the cycle of rebirth.\nWhen the flame of nature and oil of life awaken,\nthis is the wondrous joy of true life.\nCultivating the Dao’s qi to firmness,\na path to Penglai’s immortal land appears.\n\nSince ancient times, the Xu and Pang families departed;\nthey too should have escaped the suffering of rebirth.\nThoughts tangled in a thousand threads,\nwell-fed and clothed, yet still unenlightened.\nOne day, impermanence strides alone—\nwhen the soul scatters, who escapes the dark path?\n\nSince ancient times, the Xu and Pang families departed;\nthey too should have escaped the suffering of rebirth.\nWith virtue, be humble; with anger, be sparing—\nnever scorn poverty nor crave wealth.\n\nAll things embrace the myriad voices,\nmoving the high heavens and sacred ancestors.\nSince ancient times, the Xu and Pang families departed;\nthey too should have escaped the suffering of rebirth.\n\nIn this life, to be noble and wealthy,\nmust be from past-life awakening.\nYet fear the descent into the three wretched realms and dark courts—\nbefore heaven’s cycle is complete, one meets again.\nSince ancient times, the Xu and Pang families departed;\nthey too should have escaped the suffering of rebirth.\n\nThe seven treasures pass like Mount Sumeru,\nyet has the Dao’s fruit ripened?\nAwaken early to the wondrous principle of the Diamond,\nand you cross the river to transcendence.\nWhen the Dao is whole and virtue noble,\nall ascend to the Jade Flower Assembly.\n\nThose who fail to grasp yin-yang study the *Yi*,\nbut those enlightened pierce heaven and earth.\nWeary of the turbid, they emerge in stillness—\nhow many through the ages have guarded the Dao?\nWhen the Dao is whole and virtue noble,\nthe great image gathers at the Jade Flower Assembly.\n\nThe Dao’s subtlety is pure emptiness, awakened wisdom,\nresponding like a gushing spring, fulfilled in meaning.\nOnly keep your heart unobscured,\nand you merge with the five thousand profound principles.\nWhen the Dao is whole and virtue noble,\nall ascend to the Jade Flower Assembly.\n\nSome delight in reading, then drowse in sleep,\nrejoicing beneath the pines beyond the cave.\nPreserve life, nurture spirit, cultivate qi,\nembrace the One to avoid sinking as a lowly ghost.\nWhen the Dao is whole and virtue noble,\nall ascend to the Jade Flower Assembly.\n\nThe autumn moon clears the deep pool to its depths,\nrevealing a perfect radiance that illumines the body.\nThe two eights remain unbroken—true joy—\ncasting off all, one walks without fault.\nWhen the Dao is whole and virtue noble,\nall ascend to the Jade Flower Assembly.\n\nThe deluded slander through many lives,\nclinging to beauty, coveting wealth, contending in qi.\nOne day, impermanence comes, and they regret—\nthe Five-Seven Kings of Hell demand their due.\nWhen the Dao is whole and virtue noble,\nall ascend to the Jade Flower Assembly.\n\nThe karmic mirror appears before you,\nbrows knit, tears falling.\nNo use now to argue with the wisdom of life—\n\nHere at last, even children and grandchildren cannot take your place.\nWhen the Dao is whole and virtue noble,\nall ascend to the Jade Flower Assembly.\n\nSudden awakening in the blessed mountains and sacred lands,\na life of cloud and water, zither and books.\nOne thought of non-arising—no fault remains.\nHow many through the ages have attained this?\nWhen the Dao is whole and virtue noble,\nall ascend to the Jade Flower Assembly.\n\nGain and loss span heaven and earth,\nyet not an inch returns in the next life.\nSoul and spirit perish to become ghosts,\nwhile nature and destiny preserved become immortals with ease.\nWhen the Dao is whole and virtue noble,\nall ascend to the Jade Flower Assembly.\n\nUnmatched joy in serene clarity,\nbliss among rocks and pines.\nCranes dance and phoenixes welcome—only delight,\nrefining the elixir’s radiance, shedding the husk.\nWhen the Dao is whole and virtue noble,\nall ascend to the Jade Flower Assembly.\n\nSince the primal chaos, the myriad things endure,\ndying and living—how long does it last?\nA single true spirit never perishes,\nits destiny tied to the Southern Asterism and Northern Dipper.\nDescendants meet again through ritual connection,\nreverence and faith depend on the lofty perfected to deliver.\n\nAncestors long sunken in the dark path,\nwith no gate to escape hell.\nAbove, the Ten Directions save from suffering,\nwhile countless beings create karma.\nDescendants meet again through ritual connection,\nreverence and faith depend on the lofty perfected to deliver.\n\nBorn, aged, sick, suffering—then

on the lofty perfected to deliver.\n\nBeholding the tombs of Beimang’s hills,\nhow many of the ancient noble and wealthy?\nWhen the limit comes, how can one flee?\nSuddenly awakening to the Primordial Dao Ancestor.\nDescendants meet again through ritual connection,\nreverence and faith depend on the lofty perfected to deliver.\n\nThe transcendent immortals’ joyous abode beyond the world,\nwhere wondrous scenes know no four seasons.\nThose who attain the Dao truly transcend cold and heat,\nthe perfected who accumulate merit save from suffering.\nDescendants meet again through ritual connection,\nreverence and faith depend on the lofty perfected to deliver.\n\nArriving at the famed mountains and grottoes,\nwith bamboo hat and staff, one strolls at ease.\nRecognizing the Golden Crow and Jade Hare,\nyet the wondrous awakening binds the foolish ape.\nDescendants meet again through ritual connection,\nreverence and faith depend on the lofty perfected to deliver.\n\n[In Response

earth.\nAwakening: formless yet responding to things,\nBeyond the chatter of center or edge.\nPure and still, golden infant and jade maiden,\nWithin the void, mercury congeals with numinous lead.\nSix *zhu* draped,\nReturning to the Great Veil,\nOnce more receiving the Jade Emperor’s decree.\n\nAgain—\n\nBody clad in cloud-robes,\nForm like plain cloth,\nOne must not disdain pure poverty.\nThe Dao has no form or image,\nGreat awakening reveals the truth within.\nHatred and love—no virtue in either,\nAll praise and submission are good causes.\nVast fortune arrives,\nLeisurely observing the Dharma-teachings,\nPines and bamboo ever as neighbors.\n\nTrue kin—\nPreserving life and nature,\nIlluminating past and present,\nMerging with the world, dust forgotten.\nIf one follows my constant goodness,\nEternal escape from sinking and drowning.\nThe Peng Isle’s immortal realm lies close,\nShedding form to reveal the true spirit.\nBeyond the azure skies,\nIn the Great Veil’s heavens,\nThe flawless treasure-light renewed.\n\nAgain—\n\nMyriad evils—heart extinguished,\nA thousand thoughts—mind dissolved,\nNaturally, sins and afflictions vanish.\nA thread of spirit clings to the Dao,\nMovement and stillness both forgotten.\nPure will like Pang’s or Xu’s,\nWandering clouds and waters—everywhere home.\nThe immortals’ joy:\nA thatched hut in quiet seclusion,\nFar surpassing grand halls.\n\nNo haste.\nContemplate the ancient teachings,\nSuddenly grasp the supreme truth,\nAscend to the Three Luminaries.\nNo need for day or night,\nCounting lines of ink in search.\nNurtured true lead, true mercury,\nShedding form—beyond heaven and earth’s measure.\nBeyond azure skies,\nReturning to the Great Veil,\nOnce more bowing to Ma Danyang.\n\n---\n\n*Divine Light Radiant (Shengsheng Man)* Three Poems\n\nChu Xuan bows deeply,\nTo the esteemed Libationer,\nThree years since our parting.\nLonging and reverence—paths too distant,\nNo messenger could suffice.\nIn the heat of early autumn, Xin-You,\nA visitor sent, then swiftly departed.\nI inquired of your state—\nLearned of your flourishing duties,\nSoon to be promoted.\n\nOne day, world-weary with merit fulfilled,\nYou’ll follow Yuanming’s joy in the Dao,\nCompanion to forests and springs.\nUnfettered, laughing and chanting,\nBefore the pines beyond the cave.\nNurtured true lead, true mercury,\nWhen the time comes—three thousand merits complete.\nAscend to the Origin,\nRevealing your true form, strolling the cloud pavilion alone.\n\n---\n\nChu Xuan bows again,\nTo the High Merit of the Dao Register,\nSince our parting under the sun, rare to meet.\nLonging and reverence—when shall I\nBehold the immortal’s countenance?\nIn the mid-winter of Xin-You,\nI hastily lit incense, knelt to receive your opened letter.\nVirtue of the Clear River,\nYour karmic threads unfold in rites,\nDevotion boundless.\n\nLight pervades the ten directions—truly perfected,\nDeparting to the Great Veil, paying homage to the Sage,\nAscending into the high vault.\nBody draped in cloud-robes for ten thousand miles,\nIntent on riding the wind.\nThis time, liberated from birth and death,\nFree to come and go—straddling tigers, riding dragons.\nBeyond heaven and earth,\nHow many through the ages have truly walked this path?\n\n---\n\nChu Xuan bows deeply,\nTo the Moon-Veiled Lords Zhang and Tang,\nSince our parting, my thoughts linger.\nSuddenly, over a year has passed—\nI hear you now dwell in Tianchang.\nI recall the serene seat of the Dharma-teacher,\nSpeaking of rites in Guanzhong, at Qiyang.\nIncense and flowers led the way,\nWhere Lord Hao, perceiving the Dao,\nGreatly laughed at Chongyang.\n\nThen I, Chu Xuan, recklessly spoke,\nPouring a verse to the River Moon,\nA single thought unforgotten.\nWorn iron sandals in vain search,\nIn the dim radiance of the spirit.\nNaturally, the wondrous exists within nothingness,\nThe Dao’s mystery—emptiness enfolding all things.\nWith merit complete, depart,\nAscend to the Great Veil’s heavens,\nAwarded the celestial jade chime.\n\n---\n\n*Pouring the River Moon (Nian Nu Jiao)* Five Poems\n\nFrom ancient times to now, trading bones,\nContemplating life, death, rise, and fall—\nHow many?\nA hundred years of light, four seasons pressing,\nUnnoticed, the form ages.\nWorldly falsity, fleeting glory,\nA turn of the head like a dream,\nAll ends in vanity.\nOne thought of non-birth,\nClinging to the Dao—truly enlightened.\n\nBest to dwell in blessed lands,\nBy mountains, beside waters,\nFreely wandering with staff in hand.\nSecuring true joy, hidden in rosy caves,\nLeisurely perusing the sacred teachings.\nMerits and deeds complete,\nLife and nature perfected,\nSurpassing repeated rites.\nRefining the Dao-body,\nA golden edict arrives from on high.\n\n---\n\nMy cares from Longxi,\nTo Weiyang’s Qin Terrace,\nComing and going in vain.\nThe esteemed Prefect and Magistrate,\nVisiting before departure, urging me.\nIn the new year of Ren-Xu,\nThey wished to invite me to the prefecture,\nYet the Master did not consent.\nChu Xuan replied,\nHere, too, the Lantern Festival is celebrated.\n\nWho awakens to the Three Origins in the four seasons?\nHeavenly officials bestow blessings,\nDescending to relieve the suffering of yin spirits.\nBorn in the Central Land, revering virtue,\nThe world praises, names echo through the ages.\nGrand rites of vast fortune,\nBlue petitions presented to the Sage,\nResponses rarely met.\nWenshan’s rites,\nWhite turtle, lotus—supporting Ancestor Wang.\n\n---\n\nLiving past Pengzu,\nHolding rank above the first grade,\nAs rich as Shi Chong.\nFrom ancient times to now, worldly affairs—\nRealizing their weightlessness.\nRetiring like Yuanming,\nSailing like Fan Li,\nAlready transcended.\nTruly mastering the Dao,\nEscaping the dark paths of death.\n\nCloud-steps to Penglai, Langyuan,\nImmortal lands never night,\nEach has its carefree abode.\nBeyond the Celestial Origin’s supreme Dao,\nA thousand years—hard to encounter.\nThe spark of life’s light,\nFoam’s birth and death,\nFlying crows following the hare.\nSwiftly cultivate life and nature,\nWise sages secretly guide you.\n\n---\n\nSitting in the azure pavilion’s quiet,\nSuddenly forgetting words,\nLeisurely perusing a thousand scrolls of poetry and books.\nPine path, staff in hand, truly clinging to the Dao,\nProfound, the celestial mechanism’s depth.\nBeyond the world, within the mortal realm,\nCapital’s clouds, cave’s radiance,\nWhen the wisdom-eye opens—seen.\nExistence and non-existence both dissolved,\nLaughing and chanting, floating life unjudged.\n\nThe households of Pang and Xu ascend,\nReturning to the Great Veil,\nEscaping the trade of bones, life and death.\nImmortal lands never night—no suffering,\nLangyuan’s jade pools, pure feasts.\nSeas turn to withered pines,\nEternal youth—no aging,\nWorldly falsity—no envy.\nSix-spun robes draped,\nAgain ascending to the Origin, revealed anew.\n\n---\n\nWeary of dwelling in the mortal world,\nLike a lone cloud drifting,\nA crane soaring to the heavens.\nUnfettered, unbound, beyond the void,\nLetting go—directly transcending the other shore.\nEverywhere home,\nZither and books as companions,\nFreely writing, chanting sighs.\nReclining in the grotto-heaven,\nLet others mock my laziness.\n\nSummer nears—hundred-foot pines tower,\nWater curtains roar,\nFlying into the Dragon Spring Gorge.\nThirst quenched with rosy nectar at immortal gatherings,\nYouths singing, lips and tongues loose.\nEscaping the wheel of rebirth,\nLife and nature perfected,\nThe deluded struggle to follow.\nForsaking fame, renouncing profit,\nLet others praise or blame at will.\n\n---\n\n*Water Dragon Chant*\n\nThis early winter of Xin-You,\nOn the full moon of the Lower Origin,\nSweet rain arrives.\nWheat sprouts flourish,\nRoots deep, stems firm,\nMore joy, fewer cares.\nClinging to the Dao—no disasters,\nSages protect—no suffering for beings.\nThe Celestial Origin nears its end,\nImmortals celebrate in assembly,\nMerits complete—\nAscend to the Origin.\n\nBeyond lies the celestial palace’s treasure,\nPerfected true cultivation—\nAscending the cloud path.\nSix-spun robes draped,\nPure peace, blessings bestowed,\nNine ancestors, seven generations.\nReturning—no aging or death,\nNaturally, life and nature—\nIlluminating past and present.\n\n**Households Devoted to the Dao**\n\nLet every household uphold the Dao from beginning to end,\nUnchanging as the steadfast Peng and Xu.\n\n*Flowers Along the Path*\nFrost-kissed forests scatter crimson leaves,\nGolden wheat surges across the land.\nWild geese depart the northern frontier,\nTheir cries echoing in flight.\nLike Yuanming, I return home,\nSipping wine in joyful solitude.\nDrunk on true delight, I laugh aloud,\nReclining high in cloud-wrapped mountains,\nForgetting the dusty world—\nFalsehoods cannot touch me.\nSuddenly awakened,\nI respond to things with no mind.\nThe Dao’s mystery runs deep by nature.\nWithin the gourd, immortal scenes differ—\nSeek no more without.\nFlowers bloom in all four seasons,\nDiscussing the past to illumine the present.\nOne day, riding the wind, I shall depart\nTo the Three Isles and Ten Continents,\nWhere Penglai’s peaks rise anew.\n\n*Two Lyrics to \"Fragrant Journey\"*\n\nI have wandered the human realm,\nYet now I envy the sacred mountains.\nIn cave-heavens so pure, I sit and listen\nTo the murmuring streams.\nTen thousand pines and cypresses,\nA thousand acres of mist and clouds—\nFine companions for my zither and books.\nTruly devoted to the Dao,\nI delight in tranquility.\n\nHaving refined the numinous lead,\nMy life’s radiance shines round.\nWhen merit is complete,\nI shall become an immortal of Penglai Isle,\nTranscending birth and death,\nEternally remembered.\nFreed from the wheel of rebirth,\nRobed in six-spun silk,\nI ascend to the Origin.\n\nAgain—\nThe golden tripod glows,\nEver burning true incense.\nPrecious vases bloom with flowers\nFragrant through all four seasons.\nSaints and sages of the void\nDwell as near as the western paradise.\nI revere the Three Pure Ones,\nIllumine the Three Luminaries,\nAnd awaken to the Three Sovereigns.\n\nIn ancient times, people were simple,\nHonest and blessed with good fortune.\nTheir nature connected to heaven,\nUnobstructed by the Dao.\nThey practiced equality in secret,\nSoftness overcoming hardness.\nTheir minds like those of immortals,\nTheir conduct wholly immortal—\nThey journeyed to the immortal realm.\n\n*Willow by the Mountain Pavilion*\n\nThose who retreat from the Dao fall,\nThose who advance in the Dao rise.\nRetreating is folly—\nThe mind wanders, the heart stirs,\nLife is lost to endless greed.\nUnafraid of divine scrutiny,\nA thousand faults, ten thousand errors\nBewilder the living.\nIn death, they plunge into Fengdu’s torments,\nSuffering without end, reborn among beasts.\n\nThose who advance in the Dao,\nPure and true, forget the world’s illusions,\nLeisurely studying sacred teachings like scholars.\nComprehending principles, they awaken to cultivation.\nQi congeals, the spirit becomes wondrous,\nNaturally, rosy clouds and radiant light arise.\nThe precious mirror gleams in the azure sky—\nTruly, they become immortals.\n\n*Six Lyrics to \"Crossing the Mountain Brook\"*\n\nNearly seventy years old,\nThe time is ripe to forget the dusty world.\nHow long will this dream of life last?\nCultivating virtue surpasses\nStriving for meager gains.\nMountains of kindness, seas of love—\nThe fiery household burns the body.\nHearing of health, I seek coolness,\nLetting deluded people slander as they will.\n\nLeisurely observing the Three Teachings,\nI understand the transformations of the *Zhouyi*.\nComprehending principles, I connect with heaven’s mysteries,\nThe four forms dissolved—\nNo sorrow, no joy.\nIn cave-heavens, I recline at ease,\nRefining the true elixir.\nOne day, I shall ascend the azure sky,\nRevealing the marvels of non-action.\n\nAgain—\nThe splendor of the human world\nIs like a candle in the wind.\nAll things turn to emptiness in the end—\nBeyond the world, recluses enjoy\nThe pure blessings of immortals.\nIn misty peaks and grottoes,\nUnaware of autumn through the four seasons,\nPines as companions, bamboo as neighbors,\nI idly sing the song of no-birth.\n\nZither and books bring joy to my nature,\nThe Dao’s function harmonizes metal and wood.\nRefining a body for the nine heavens,\nRobed in six-spun silk,\nI swiftly ascend to the Origin.\nForever free from aging and death,\nI rise into the Great Brahma Heaven,\nAs the vast sea turns to mulberry fields—\nTruly, I follow the divine immortals.\n\nAgain—\nAll worldly affairs,\nSeen through, bring only laughter.\nLove and worldly attachments,\nLike impermanence itself,\nAre all exhausted in time.\nThis floating bubble of a body—\nWhen will its birth and death cease?\nForgetting the world’s illusions,\nAbandoning greed and strife,\nI depart from the Dao, truly enlightened.\n\nSubtle light awakens and illumines,\nResponding with profound subtlety.\nLife abides, nature connects to heaven,\nNaturally bestowing boundless radiance.\nYang pure, yin exhausted,\nI shed my shell, freed from sinking.\nRoaming the Jasper Pool,\nPlaying in the Jade Pond,\nThe Jade Emperor’s golden decree summons me.\n\nAgain—\nAtop the Jade Peak,\nI know there are three plots of land.\n\nAs the Ren-water nourishes the golden sprout,\nTen thousand bushels of pearls cannot compare.\nOne grain of hemp, one grain of wheat—\nConsumed, they bring natural peace.\nCultivating life and nature,\nThe body endures, years extend,\nDrawing near to cloud-and-mist companions.\nBeyond yin and yang,\nHeaven and earth cannot constrain.\nAttaining the Dao, I escape rebirth,\nWeary of the world, I retreat—\nTo ancient temples in sacred halls.\nThrough effortless merit and practice,\nTruly perfected, I ascend to the Origin.\nSix *zhu* of silk draped,\nMy true form appears,\nRoaming the Three Isles and Ten Continents.\n\nAgain—\nBy the Red Lotus Pool,\nNo mountain scenery can rival this.\nAmidst the bustle, yet untroubled in heart,\nThe body like a lotus—\nEmerging from mud, its blossom serene.\nThe wondrous realm of the Gourd Heaven,\nHolds a spring eternal through all four seasons.\nTruly responsive to things,\nRadiant with jewel-like light—\nWho through the ages has understood?\nWith true practice of virtue and power,\nManifesting transformation, evil returns to right.\nWords adapt, voices follow,\nOnly to keep the inch of spirit free from illness.\nGreed and strife exhausted,\nThe Dao-eye opens naturally.\nBeyond this world,\nMerging with the imperial capital,\nAccumulating deeds of constant equality.\n\nAgain—\nFriend Wang Xu,\nToday we part once more.\nWhen shall we meet again?\nPerhaps next year,\nWhen autumn returns anew.\nOnce a year we gather,\nHow many times in a hundred years?\nFor now, sit awhile,\nLet the mind rest from haste—\nSun and moon rise and set.\nWorldly honor and disgrace,\nDisgrace like the moon’s waning light.\nLittle joy, much worry,\nThinking of love and attachment,\nWeary of speaking of right and wrong.\nAs the Heavenly Origin nears its end,\nI urge you—hasten to cultivate the true.\nRoam the grotto heavens,\nDwell in pine-clad peaks,\nAt ease, peruse the *Zhuangzi* and *Liezi*.\n\n**Jade Hall Spring (Two Poems)**\n\nVirtue and power, pure and level,\nThe worthy are truly easy to transform.\nWorldly dreams seen as empty—\nHow many let go?\nWeary of filth, dwelling in clarity,\nThe celestial cycle turns through hexagrams.\nThe body is a wandering hermitage,\nA home wherever it goes.\nNurturing the perfect radiance,\nAzure emptiness, no clinging—\nHanging naturally, a thousand miles of limpid clarity.\nBeyond things, carefree,\nUnfettered, truly at ease.\nThe awakened transcend,\nWhile learners remain entangled.\n\nAgain—\nIn the immortal’s temple, numinous and void,\nFor two years, coming and going.\nBroken, then rebuilt,\nThe star-crown nurtures simplicity.\nResponding with true non-being,\nFasting and rituals relieve ten thousand sufferings.\nUnderstanding principle, forgetting words,\nDwelling in stillness.\nDao, Buddha, Confucian—vast,\nTogether as the Three Teachings,\nBeyond the door, the Five Constants:\nReverence, humility, worthiness, and trust.\nFree from the four marks of the mind,\nNaturally, joy abounds.\nBeyond yin and yang,\nThe primordial appears.\n\n**Treading Clouds (Nine Poems of Treading the Sedge)**\n\nOn the twelfth day of mid-winter, in the year *xinyou*,\nPassing through the Great Origin Residence,\nAt dawn’s gate, I suddenly beheld\nSoutheastern rosy clouds.\nFreely brushed—\n\nGazing afar to the southeast,\nBrilliant hues divide the radiance.\n\nSuddenly, I saw the path to Binzhou.\nThrough jiao rites, resonance calls upon the lofty perfected,\nFor in years past, there was the noble Liu.\nVirtue fills the ten directions, saving boundless beings.\nMyriad purities, myriad virtues—principles vast and profound.\n\nOne day, returning to Penglai,\nThe wondrous Dao of non-action holds no falsehood.\n\n---\n\nSeventy years of light,\nFifty-two myriad.\nGuard against the unforeseen, the limitless impermanence.\nCast aside this borrowed form, descend to yellow springs—\nThrough life’s changes, time’s praises resound.\n\nSuddenly awakened to the numinous peak,\nTruly transcending the other shore.\nShedding form, ascending to the cloudy Han,\nOnce the celestial origin is passed, there is no return.\nThe treaders of sedge—none can catch them.\n\n---\n\nThe sagely Dao is rare to meet,\nYet true cultivation is easily encountered.\nThe natural principle illumines past and present.\nDeath and life trade bones a thousand times,\nBut this time, fully realized—no coming, no going.\n\nIn Penglai’s immortal land,\nPrimordial numinosity knows no suffering.\nOn the road to audience with the origin, the lofty perfected approve.\nPines wither, seas shift—yet this endures forever.\nIn years to come, ten thousand ancestors escape the yin府.\n\n---\n\nMother and child reunite,\nNaturally enlightened to the Dao.\nEmerging from the shell of things, free from birth and old age.\nThatched hut, pines, and bamboo ever as neighbors.\n\nIn tranquil seclusion, the immortal’s home is fine.\nReverent faith in the lofty and bright—\nTrue joy knows no vexation.\nEach must cultivate life and destiny early.\nWhen merit is complete and conduct fulfilled, escape the wheel of rebirth,\nShedding form to ride the crane back to Penglai.\n\n---\n\nLast year at Zhou Pavilion,\nThis year I return again.\nTime flies like an arrow, hastening man’s old age.\nSeeing through worldly emptiness, best to rest the heart—\nBegin cultivation early, with resolve.\n\nUnwilling to forget attachments,\nRegret and remorse will follow.\nOn Pine Peak, delight in the Dao, content with fate’s provisions.\nFrom nothingness refine mercury and lead,\nThen ride the clouds and crane back to Penglai.\n\n---\n\nChildren and gold shackles,\nLove’s jade fetters—\nA fiery pit, a prison cell, the body like a convict.\nBewildered, one becomes like a spring silkworm,\nSwiftly break free, guard the void within.\n\nDay and night in haste,\nCrow flies, hare runs—\nFloating bubbles arise and perish, form cannot endure.\nHasten to cultivate life and destiny, escape the wheel of rebirth,\nPerfect merit and conduct to befriend Penglai’s immortals.\n\n---\n\nDisordered by dregs and wine,\nNourished by jade nectar—\nDo not be deluded by existence; seek in non-existence.\nFrom the twelve-tiered tower gaze toward Penglai,\n\nWhere wisdom’s gaze shines bright, light knows no bounds.\nTrue joy abounds, roaming through grotto-heavens.\nHow many through the ages have known the Dao’s mystery?\nShouldering clouds, strolling into cinnabar skies,\nReturning to the Great Canopy, the office of non-action.\n\n---\n\nWherever one dwells is home, like the quail’s nest unattached.\nReady to depart, one wanders the clouds at will.\nBeyond yin and yang, things cannot constrain;\nChang’an is but a footstep away, not truly distant.\nThe Dao’s joy lies in the subtle and serene, beyond life and death.\nFrom the primal origin, a single gleam flashes like lightning,\nNaturally illuminating the void,\nWith life pure and flawless, cultivation is complete.\n\n---\n\nThree years since parting, returning to this place,\nThe cloud hermitage is still, the heart’s intent forgotten.\nAt times, delighting in the perusal of immortal scriptures,\nNaturally, principles are grasped, true clarity attained.\nTrue joy lies in the subtle and serene; the Dao is revered, virtue noble.\nAll is relinquished, nothingness embraced, joy and sorrow forgotten.\nIn the secluded grotto-heaven, the clamor of the world is merged,\nTo ascend the cloud-path, first transcend this.\n\n---\n\n*Three Poems Lamenting the Yellow Flowers*\n\nCountless are the transgressions of sentient beings,\nVast as the heavens.\nAwaken to the world as a dream, know its emptiness,\nDo not contend over self and others.\nAdapt to love and hate, without strife, without calamity.\nIn matters before the eyes, suddenly see through and understand.\nRevere the Dao, cultivate cause and effect,\nTightly bind the monkey of the mind.\nAttain the natural true wisdom,\nIn walking, standing, sitting, and lying.\nComprehending principles, enlightened,\nThe immortal scriptures transcend the mundane, never falling.\nHidden in grotto-heavens,\nHow many have there been through the ages?\n\n---\n\nThe celestial epoch nears its end, last year’s hexagrams exhausted.\nIn this worldly dream, karmic ties—when will they cease?\nWhen the three inches of breath no longer come, all turn to bare skulls.\nAt such a time, worldly thoughts and the heart are extinguished.\nThe Dao’s spirit is truly inexhaustible, worldly karma forgotten.\nAwakening to myriad wisdoms and thousandfold insights,\nSuddenly all is clear.\nOutwardly appearing foolish and dull,\nChanting and laughing like a wind-blown lamp.\nJoy knows no bounds,\nLet all things come to their end.\n\nThe Great Elder departs,\nLodging at a common inn.\nJust as in former years,\nLike Pang and Xu, blending with the world.\nEating meat, yet cherishing living beings;\nDrinking wine, but never to excess.\nWilling to forget greed,\nCasually discussing past and present.\nThe joy of the immortals’ realm,\nRoaming freely on cloud paths.\nCultivating nature beyond the world,\nAs the golden crow follows the jade hare.\nWalking to visit Penglai Mountain,\nOnce the work is done, leaving the dusty realm.\nShedding the mortal form,\nPaying homage to Father Danyang.\n\n*Three Green Apricot Songs*\n\nIn the ninth month, autumn’s chill descends.\nGrateful to the noble lord,\nWho again offers the nectar of clouds.\nHard to bear such profound gifts and boundless kindness—\nIn this world, fame and profit,\nGreed and strife, worldly cares,\nLeave the body seated but the heart restless.\nThe Dao’s transformation fears impermanence.\nFor thirty years,\nAll reverence to Danyang.\nIn Donglai, the entire prefecture harbors no falsehoods.\nThe celestial epoch celebrates this gathering.\nThis time, returning,\nOne appears before the Heavenly Emperor.\n\n---\n\nThinking of the Jade Nectar of the Dao,\nAttaining true joy,\nLaughing heartily, haha!\nNaturally drunk, carefree and blissful,\nBy mountains and waters,\nBeyond the cloud-grottoes,\nSinging with delight afterward.\nThe world’s scenes rush by like a shuttle.\nClinging to Mount Grace,\nWaves upon waves.\nIf one turns back to return to the True One,\nRefining lead and mercury,\nOnce the work is complete and merit fulfilled,\nAscending into the misty heavens.\n\n---\n\nThe deluded are like river sands.\n\nThinking of the world’s scholars, thick as hemp,\nTen thousand revere and believe, yet none awaken.\nGazing now and looking back through time,\nThis floating life is but a muddled dream—\nEach and every one has strayed.\nThose who comprehend must not boast or brag.\nSeek the grotto-heavens, lie at ease amidst mist and clouds.\nOnly in the years to come, upon returning, will they know:\nThe Jasper Terrace and the Park of Lang,\nWhere immortals dwell in joy,\nAnd four-season immortal blossoms bloom.\n\n*Two Poems on \"Spring at Wuling\"*\n\nFrom afar, the hills of Gang Mountain stand just right,\nLuminous and fragrant in their splendor.\nA fine season, spring’s warmth, spring’s long days—\nBest to float upon the nectar of rosy clouds.\nDrunken and singing, carefree, forgetting worldly cares,\nLaughing and smiling, surpassing reckless abandon.\nComing and going between the land of immortals and the realm of Dao,\nPassing through, we celebrate the Double Ninth.\n\n*Again*\n\nIn mid-spring of the Xin-You year, wandering to Kan’s heights,\nAll day seated in the spring garden.\nRare scenes, wondrous blossoms before my eyes,\nBeneath the trees, surpassing the bamboo pavilion.\nKnowing the world’s dream is empty, I let it go,\nAt ease, like a true immortal.\nFine wine is poured, the cup shared with worthy companions,\nRejoicing in the Dao, I thank the lofty heavens.\n\n*Two Poems on \"Grateful for Imperial Grace\"*\n\nDaoism, Buddhism, and the Confucian gate,\nTruly penetrate the ocean of dharma.\nBeyond the subtleties of *Yi*’s yin and yang,\nOne naturally understands.\nThe Diamond’s supreme truth,\nInstantly dissolves strife and erases attachment.\nThe five thousand profound words,\nPacify and illuminate the great.\n\nA faint light revolves,\nWeaving into a canopy of clouds.\nRosy radiance ever illumines the body—\nWhat hindrance could there be?\nThough pines wither and rocks crumble,\nThe ancient truth endures unchanged.\nWhen merit and conduct are complete in years to come,\nAscend to the immortal realms.\n\n*Again*\n\nThe sacred temple is called \"Heaven’s Eternity,\"\nWith starry crown and cloud-woven robes.\nNurturing a body of gold and jade,\nTruly imperishable.\nKnowing the great Dao,\nNaturally reveals being from non-being.\nThe world’s splendor holds no allure for the heart,\nAs I wander to Wangwu.\nOutwardly poor, preserving life,\nConcealing truth in humble abode.\nFrom the beginning, formless and without appearance,\nYet surpassing abundance.\nThough mulberry fields turn to seas,\nThis unshaped one endures.\nSilently I pray for our emperor’s virtue,\nTo match the heavens in longevity.\n\n*Gazing Afar at the Journey*\n\nYour offspring, of noble lineage,\nTread the cloud-wandering path with ease.\nSuddenly awakened,\nThe subtle wonders of the unseen and inaudible are clear through the ages.\nHaving traversed the dusty world,\nI see no companions in all directions.\nWhether the world loves or scorns,\nThe perfected ones permit it.\n\nHaving mastered the Dao and fulfilled nature and life,\nForever freed from the suffering of rebirth.\nDwelling in blessed lands,\nAmidst pine peaks and cloud grottoes, at ease.\nWaiting until gold-lead and jade-mercury are refined,\nTruly without turbid cares.\nDonning the six *zhu* robe,\nOnly then will I ascend past the Three Clarities.\n\n*Four Poems on \"Calming the Waves\"*\n\nBefore the ritual, all gentlemen purify their conduct,\nMoving heaven, evoking responses—blessings no light matter.\nThe celestial moisture nourishes jade-like fields, farmers rejoice,\nAutumn’s harvest comes.\nGrain fields sprout pearls, bean shoots grow.\nTo repay heaven’s grace, exalt virtue and the Dao,\nFollow conditions, be content, and do not contend.\nEach day, gaze afar, burn incense, and dine on plain fare,\nWithout hatred.\nA mind at peace, words spoken like a sage’s scripture.\n\n*Again*\n\nSweet rain falls in season, precious as oil,\nToday’s joy leaves no room for sorrow.\nTomorrow night, singing while plowing the wild fields,\nScold the ox—\nA light flick of the whip surpasses all cultivation.\n\nBeyond Heaven’s Origin, deeds are hard to accumulate,\nA sesame seed, a grain of wheat—harvested in an inch’s space.\nOnce the Crimson Infant is nurtured, one ascends beyond the clouds,\nAt ease—\nLife’s radiance round as the autumn moon’s first glow.\n\nAgain\n\nOnce a month, burn incense, fast at the sun’s gaze,\nObserve these precepts to dissolve calamity.\nOn *jiazi* and *gengshen* days, mark the seventh cycle,\nRejoice—\nThe spirits of officials and gods arrive in due time.\n\nWith body and mind purified, free from sickness and suffering,\nNurture true nature, preserve life, and move through the Three Terraces.\nWhen merit and deeds are complete, where shall one go?\nAh—\nRiding clouds, straddling a crane, off to Penglai.\n\nAgain\n\nThe *gui* door sealed by clouds, the hexagram’s lines in motion,\nPierce open the numinous aperture where tiger and dragon entwine.\nFrom *mao* to *you*, the true vision unfolds,\nLofty Kun—\nThe Golden Elder spins his thread to hook the jade sea-turtle.\n\nThe Dao and virtue clear, the Dharma sea luminous,\nMyriad lights manifest, the Nine Heavens high.\nCreation moves naturally, the spirit’s workings turn—\nBeyond containment.\n\nThe ancient and modern enlightened gather in the ranks of immortals.\n*Gazing Toward Penglai* (*Wang Jiangnan*), Six Poems\n\nZhou Pavilion departs,\nZhuang’s wrappings once more invite.\nThe thought of the Dao ever as if awakened in meeting,\nThe celestial origin comprehended—life and death transcended.\nMyriad karmas instantly dissolved and gone.\n\nGreat fortune arrives,\nThe precious mirror shines bright and clear.\nThe Three Realms and ten directions fully illuminated,\nWhy trouble with water burning in fire?\nAttaining the Dao, yet not yet free.\n\nAgain\n\nNearing middle age,\nThe heart hopes for a century’s span.\nAll things, when turned to look back, are but a single dream,\nThe two—sin and blessing—closely follow.\nThose who contemplate the Dao know the sages.\n\nLife and nature understood,\nRare in this world, past or present.\nClear and unborn, truly undying,\nNaturally conjoined are Kan and Li.\nSeek not the ladder to heaven.\n\nAgain\n\nThe Clear River rejoices,\nThe Daoist register marks high merit.\nAlready thirty years within the Dao’s gate,\nOn Qin Terrace in *xinyou*, we meet again.\nFollowing transformation, good affinities abound.\n\nIn years to come,\nAscending into the Great Veil.\nClad in six *zhu* robes, paying homage to the Supreme Sage,\nThis time dwelling forever in the Nine Yang Palace.\nWhen the time comes, ride the wind.\n\nThe chief arrives,\nThe prefect then extends his invitation.\nBidden to sit within the Hidden Spring Hall,\nAt whatever hour—dawn or clear morning—\nTrue blessing dissolves through the Dao’s power.\n\nTo draw near the rite,\nHasten swift as the wind’s drift.\nThe Daoist Lingxu divides his portion,\nThe young disciple joins to tend the burning.\nWorthy sages dwell in cinnabar skies.\n\nAgain\n\nForm like the crane,\nNature radiant as

      "translated_text": "Here the immortal’s hand plants flowers that never fade,\nWith little effort, lingzhi herbs grow in the shade.\nThrough years of self-refinement, dwelling in grotto-heavens bright,\nThe Dao’s true cultivation shines beyond the dust’s dull blight.\n\nBefore noon and after seem as one fleeting span,\nEver joyful, gazing upon Zhuangzi’s and Laozi’s plan.\nBefore dawn’s first light, the hour of *yin* is known,\nAll signs revealed in clarity, the hidden truths are shown.\n\nO’er seas the raven flies, bearing jade mercury’s flight,\nAcross the sky the hare pounds gold, ever new and bright.\nIts radiance outshines the world’s most splendid scene,\nNo earthly garden’s spring can match this realm serene.\n\nFrom moon to moon, past and present tales unfold,\nSeeking the young and simple, where death and life are one, untold.\nForsaking fame and gain, descending from the lofty height,\nThrough *jia*, *geng*, and *bing*, embracing cold and heat’s full might.\n\nBefore late autumn, blossoms fill the balustrade,\nBeyond the third summer’s end, fresh greens the platter lade.\nSipping jade nectar from dawn’s first light,\nOffering rare delicacies till the dead of night.\n\nGazing toward the azure vault, the path beyond the clouds,\nRiding phoenix and simurgh, pure joy abounds.\nBeholding clear skies where even a speck of haze is gone,\nThe three and two unite, the heart’s ashes strewed anon.\n\nRoaming wondrous lands, jesting with pines and bamboo,\nSecluded in immortal gardens, chanting of plum and willow’s hue.\nWitnessing late spring’s dream of birth and decay,\nEncountering the waning moon, hastening heat and cold’s sway.\n\nWhen you recognize the full light’s radiant glow,\nThe mirror’s truth reveals the hare’s ebb and flow.\nTurning back the myriad beings, the treasure’s light renewed,\nThe axe cleaves the mountain, the jade maiden viewed.\n\nRevolving the three yangs, golden stamens unfold,\nEntwining the four forms, snow and spring’s tale retold.\nAs months come and go, meeting *ding-mao*’s sign,\nIn rites of dawn, encountering *wu-chen*’s time.\n\nDonning cloud-robes, hidden in jade grottoes deep,\nRefining through clouds, the nine heavens’ form to keep.\nWhen the numinous comes, the treasure’s light is drawn,\nWhen the awn departs, the white ox’s trace is gone.\n\nThe earth’s good cause unfolds from dusk to dawn,\nThe heart responds with constancy, firm yet gently drawn.\nGolden cheeks inverted, dwelling on Lotus Peak,\nTo know the Dao, one must traverse the other shore’s mystique.\n\nBeyond all cares, cultivating life and fate,\nDiscoursing on Fan Li, adrift in a single skiff’s estate.\nFeasting on fine fare, urged by others’ haste,\nDeparting heaven’s kitchen, only to return with grace.\n\nBeholding the infant, first glimpsing insight’s spark,\nHearing the maiden’s call, the head turns once more to mark.\nTransmitting jade secrets, transcending *samadhi*’s bound,\nShooting forth golden light, illuminating both cheeks’ ground.\n\nThe Dao’s ebb and flow lie beyond heaven and earth,\nAtop Yangtower, floating jade cups of mirth.\nBefore dawn’s first light, the truth of *yin* is clear,\nWandering immortal grottoes, where Penglai’s spring appears.\n\nThe moon hastens, urging the world’s fleeting scenes to fade,\nYet rites of leisure follow the Dao’s light, ever made.\nThe cloud-borne guest transmits mercury’s elixir’s art,\nThe alchemical classics’ secrets shared with those apart.\n\nThe treasure’s auspicious light reappears once more,\nThe infant attains freedom, stretching as before.\nEntering principle, the true light concealed,\nBeholding the pot’s sun and moon, their span revealed.\n\nDonning cloud-robes, paying homage to the Dao’s source,\nFeasting on millet, refining cinnabar’s force.\nAt midnight’s hour, the red candle’s glow is bright,\nBefore the fast’s descent, river incense takes flight.\n\nIn profound obscurity, only awakening’s key,\nThoughts of emerald bamboo lead to the cool hall’s spree.\nDragon coils, tiger reaches the hour of *yin*,\nHexagrams drawn anew, heralding fortune’s kin.\n\nAwakening to seas and skies where clouds and waves amass,\nIlluminating rivers and lands where frost and snow align, en masse.\nThe youth guides, playing amidst Penglai’s scene,\nThe maiden first roams Luo’s garden, where spring is serene.\n\nThe moon’s flight brings the changes of birth, age, decay,\nFlowery adornments renew the world’s dust each day.\nSeeking reclusion, dwelling in Qingcheng’s embrace,\nThe Dao’s way in the world brings compassion and grace.\n\nRefining mercury and lead, discerning the false and true,\nDiscoursing on virtue and power, awakening to the genuine hue.\nIn pure accumulation, pitying the poor and low,\nIn radiant cultivation, cherishing the noble’s glow.\n\nIn use, no high or low, but balance’s art,\nIn dwelling, entering and exiting like scales impart.\nThe immortal’s music and Dao reside by clouds’ side,\nThe child idly chants verses from realms beyond the tide.\n\nBinding and hanging light, transcending the nine lands,\nEncroaching on vibrant scenes, reaching the three heavens’ strands.\nThrough changes, the celestial stems’ years are known,\nYet the laws of *jia-zi* cycles remain obscure, alone.\n\nWith three lives’ truths suddenly realized,\nKnowing all distinctions dissolved marks the sage’s prize.\nThe body drifts, ethereal, to cloud-borne chariots,\nThe horse returns again—who awakens to past grievances’ targets?\n\nDragging away, clarity dawns: extreme favor breeds harm,\nThe heart’s resonance turns harm to favor’s balm.\nKnowing Han’s generals meet the pure ancestor’s line,\nBeholding Fufeng’s encounter with Taiyuan’s sign.\n\nSecluded in mountains, the true one blends with the world’s guise,\nExpounding the great scripture of five thousand words’ wise.\nThe true immortal of Penglai hides as a grotto guest,\nRoaming, revealing traces, delighting in the worthy and best.\n\nComprehending the myriad wonders, fulfilling heaven’s will,\nAwakening to a thousand mysteries, following nature’s skill.\nBeholding the clear and peaceful, practicing virtue and power,\nHearing praises of the highest, perfecting benevolence each hour.\n\nCultivating the primal visage of the original state,\nAt life’s utmost, increasing blessings beyond measure’s weight.\nDiscoursing on the capital’s splendor, where great talents hide,\nAs cold departs and warmth returns, nature’s course abides.\n\nIlluminating the Dao above, like stars that brightly gleam,\nAwakening within the breast, like brocade’s rich seam.\nNurturing pines and bamboos through three seasons’ play,\nCultivating vibrant blossoms, urging four seasons’ sway.\n\nPerfecting the myriad practices, ascending to the origin’s gate,\nContemplating the sages of old, whose virtue was truly great.\nRoaming cloudy grottoes, where treasure’s light descends,\nDeparting to transcend the dust, with a separate fate that extends.\n\nWith a heart empty and full, no illness takes root,\nWith a belly replete, hunger is forgot.\nWithin and without, who truly sees?\nAwakening to center and edge, how many know these?\n\nDiscoursing on heaven and hell, realms vast and wide,\nComprehending the supreme mystery, fitting and applied.\nRarely seen, the centenarian’s form,\nThe true guest ascends to azure heights, the heavens’ norm.\n\nWhen crossbows lie idle, the land’s wealth abounds,\nAfter chaos and desolation, few people are found.\nIlluminating the covered and borne, bridging barbarian ways,\nRevolving the celestial cycle, achieving sagely feats always.\n\nScholars, farmers, artisans, merchants—all honor the good Dao,\nBarbarians rejoice, praising kings and lords’ sway.\nThe heart’s flow like Jinjiang’s river, smooth and clear,\nFire and water merge, like Han’s valiant peer.\n\nWhere goodness thrives, wind and hail are few,\nAcross the three realms, snow and frost accrue.\nComprehending vast accumulations of three thousand deeds,\nRevolving subtle transmissions through twelve cycles’ leads.\n\nThe secret’s natural pivot and essence suddenly known,\nEver delighting in the Dao, singing and chanting its tone.\nBelow, the worthies gather, discoursing on past and present’s lore,\nOnly the enlightened are true kindred spirits evermore.\n\nThe raven’s dangling feet pierce heaven’s clarity,\nThe hare’s pounding light awakens the Dao’s heart, free.\nIntent transforms, vast as Mount Sumeru’s height,\nHumility’s spirit deep as the ocean’s might.\n\nWherever clouds drift, immortal dwellings thrive,\nPlanting yellow sprouts when *ren* rains arrive.\nIn boundless obscurity, only awakening’s gate,\nThoughts of emerald bamboo lead to the cool hall’s state.",

(continued)**\n\nThe heart’s exchange remains ever serene,\nThe mind’s imaginings free from strangeness.\nIn an instant, at the eastern gate,\nWe parted for two years.\nMountains and rivers unchanged,\nYet many people are no longer here.\nLife is like dewdrops on a pearl—\nHow can it not decay?\nBorn in the Central Land,\nOnce one’s allotted span is spent, it cannot be regained.\nAn inch of the spirit’s Dao-treasure\nIs worth ten thousand gold, yet priceless.\nUnfulfilled greed and contention\nAll stem from love and attachment.\nThe four pursuits of fame and profit—\nEveryone understands them.\nYet to comprehend virtue and the Dao,\nIs to truly penetrate the Dharma-sea.\nAuspicious mist and propitious qi\nWeave into a canopy of clouds.\nStrolling at ease on Pine Peak,\nThe spirit soars beyond the clouds.\nWorldly falsity knows emptiness,\nBut birth and death are weighty matters.\nIn the secluded grotto-heavens,\nUnfettered, one finds joy.\nRevolving the harmonious qi,\nYin and yang unite in peace.\nHaving grasped the subtle and formless,\nOne truly ascends to the Yang realm.\nFollowing the examples of Xu and Pang,\nFree from debt or harm.\n\n**V.**\nA hundred years of human life—\nSeventy is rare.\nWorldly falsity knows emptiness,\nYet when will it ever end?\nThe Great Dao is natural,\nSerene equanimity is supreme.\nAll things without flaw—\nBetter than performing grand rites.\nThe dream of past and present ages,\nSuddenly awakens to true clarity.\nSeeing through floating life,\nAll returns to a single smile.\nBeyond the concerns of life and destiny,\nOne’s former attachments fade.\n\n**VI.**\nTo serve as an official with integrity\nIs truly free from guilt or illness.\nAbove, there are the Four Graces—\nAccumulate merit and revere all.\nLoyalty and filial piety govern the people,\nCalm the mind and nurture nature.\nLet the will not wander outward,\nAnd the spirit will naturally settle.\nConceal evil and extol goodness—\nDo not listen to idle words.\nAbandon hatred and attachment,\nEver practicing impartiality.\nUnattached to worldly splendor,\nWander idly along pine paths.\nGreen waters and blue mountains—\nGrotto-heavens and immortal realms.\nThe original face,\nPolished like a mirror.\nIlluminating present and past,\nGuard the Dao and reflect within.\nWhen merit and conduct are complete,\nOne ascends to the Great Luo to pay homage.\n\n**VII.**\nHuman life at seventy—\nRare in ancient and modern times.\nKnowing the dream of the world is hollow,\nAll returns to a single smile.\nIn leisure, seek leisure—\nTo forget contrivance is to be done.\nTen thousand kinds of empty flowers,\nIn a turn of the head, vanish like illusion.\nTruly honoring virtue and the Dao,\nGradually one penetrates the mysterious and wondrous.\nBanish hatred and attachment—\nBetter than performing grand rites.\nWithin the body, life and destiny—\nNo small matter.\nLike the sound of serene equanimity,\nEven the Lord of Yin cannot summon it.\n\n**VIII.**\nFrom nonbeing, clarity arises,\nMysteriously penetrating divine incantations.\nJade-like nectar and ambrosia\nAbide in the upper chambers.\nWhen sober, one is pure and true—\nLife extends, blessings and longevity follow.\nThe four lines of the Vajra,\nIn the sutras, offer compassionate deliverance.\nThe Dao of Heaven is hard to describe,\nFormless yet imperishable.\nInverting yin and yang,\nMao ascends to meet You.\nThe subtle and formless are natural—\nThe Three Lights radiant and wondrous.\nThe immortal flowers of Lang Garden\nSurpass the willows and blossoms of spring.\nRevolving the Southern Asterism,\nWisdom gazes upon the Northern Dipper.\nGreatly attaining nonaction,\nOne soars and roams at will.\n\n**IX.**\nContemplating the true sutra in leisure\nSurpasses empty words.\nAll things know emptiness—\nSuddenly, there is no duality.\nRevering the true without retreat,\nOne awakens as an immortal.\nPines and bamboo as neighbors,\nGuard the Dao with a pure will.\nFrom beginning to end, unwavering,\nHeaven’s mechanism secretly bestows.\nWondrous enlightenment and true constancy—\nAll movement and stillness forgotten.\nThe primordial countenance,\nThough visible, is hard to resemble.\nBeyond yin and yang,\nOne departs the cycle of birth and death.\n\n**X.**\nMother and child meet,\nNaturally enlightened to the Dao.\nWith reverent faith and a true heart,\nTake refuge in the Three Teachings.\nBanish hatred and attachment,\nAdapt to the profound and subtle.\nLet the will dissolve greed and contention—\nFree from guilt or affliction.\nLife is like dewdrops on a pearl—\nCultivate the Dao early.\nRecognizing the primordial spirit,\nOne never ages.\nSuddenly perceiving a glimmer of light,\nThe cloud-path is reached.\nDelighting in the Dao on Pine Peak,\nContent with whatever comes.\nHaving conjoined mercury and lead,\nNurture the inner countenance.\nWhen merit and conduct are both complete,\nOne truly ascends to Peng Isle.\n\n**XI.**\nA hundred strings of cash in the marketplace\nBuy four trees.\nDo not force others to seek,\nOnly aid in the work.\nUnseen matters—\nFew are real, many are false.\nWillingly form affinities,\nReverence and faith are not lacking.\nAmong ten thousand, one may have\nSurplus blessings and conduct.\nAt the immortal temples of Wu Palace,\nThe plaque reads \"Spiritual Emptiness.\"\n*(For the family of Cold-Seven Elder who left the household)*\nWhen Cold-Seven Elder of the left-home life ascended,\nHis kin held a grand vegetarian feast and ritual,\nInstructing the Daoists:\nDo not demand payment for reciting scriptures.\nIf there is no money for recitation,\nOnly partake of the vegetarian meal.\nThe feathered robe is willingly offered—\nThe ritual is splendid to behold.\nProfound virtue and great fortune\nConceal faults and earn praise.\nFor those who have not completed true cultivation,\nHow many demonic obstacles arise!\nThe sounds and sights before one’s eyes—\nPrinciples reveal their illusory nature.\nWhen mouth and heart align,\nIt is rare in the world.\nCompassionately delivering sentient beings,\nAll transcend to the other shore.\nThe enlightened nature harmonious and serene,\nWood and metal converse.\nHaving refined the true form,\nIn a single surge, one ascends to the clouds.\n\n**XII.**\nWhile parents are alive,\nHow many truly understand?\nPeople speak of long life,\nYet those who reach middle age are few.\nFrom youth to old age,\nThere is awakening and delusion.\nFortune and misfortune—\nBoth follow one’s nature.\nThe body is like the waning moon,\nYet life remains whole.\nComprehending the Dao without delusion,\nWhat doubt remains in true awakening?\nWhen the spirit’s

letter.\nVirtue of the Clear River,\nYour karmic threads unfold in rites,\nDevotion boundless.\n\nLight pervades the ten directions—truly perfected,\nDeparting to the Great Veil, paying homage to the Sage,\nAscending into the high vault.\nBody draped in cloud-robes for ten thousand miles,\nIntent on riding the wind.\nThis time, liberated from birth and death,\nFree to come and go—straddling tigers, riding dragons.\nBeyond heaven and earth,\nHow many through the ages have truly walked this path?\n\n---\n\nChu Xuan bows deeply,\nTo the Moon-Veiled Lords Zhang and Tang,\nSince our parting, my thoughts linger.\nSuddenly, over a year has passed—\nI hear you now dwell in Tianchang.\nI recall the serene seat of the Dharma-teacher,\nSpeaking of rites in Guanzhong, at Qiyang.\nIncense and flowers led the way,\nWhere Lord Hao, perceiving the Dao,\nGreatly laughed at Chongyang.\n\nThen I, Chu Xuan, recklessly spoke,\nPouring a verse to the River Moon,\nA single thought unforgotten.\nWorn iron sandals in vain search,\nIn the dim radiance of the spirit.\nNaturally, the wondrous exists within nothingness,\nThe Dao’s mystery—emptiness enfolding all things.\nWith merit complete, depart,\nAscend to the Great Veil’s heavens,\nAwarded the celestial jade chime.\n\n---\n\n*Pouring the River Moon (Nian Nu Jiao)* Five Poems\n\nFrom ancient times to now, trading bones,\nContemplating life, death, rise, and fall—\nHow many?\nA hundred years of light, four seasons pressing,\nUnnoticed, the form ages.\nWorldly falsity, fleeting glory,\nA turn of the head like a dream,\nAll ends in vanity.\nOne thought of non-birth,\nClinging to the Dao—truly enlightened.\n\nBest to dwell in blessed lands,\nBy mountains, beside waters,\nFreely wandering with staff in hand.\nSecuring true joy, hidden in rosy caves,\nLeisurely perusing the sacred teachings.\nMerits and deeds complete,\nLife and nature perfected,\nSurpassing repeated rites.\nRefining the Dao-body,\nA golden edict arrives from on high.\n\n---\n\nMy cares from Longxi,\nTo Weiyang’s Qin Terrace,\nComing and going in vain.\nThe esteemed Prefect and Magistrate,\nVisiting before departure, urging me.\nIn the new year of Ren-Xu,\nThey wished to invite me to the prefecture,\nYet the Master did not consent.\nChu Xuan replied,\nHere, too, the Lantern Festival is celebrated.\n\nWho awakens to the Three Origins in the four seasons?\nHeavenly officials bestow blessings,\nDescending to relieve the suffering of yin spirits.\nBorn in the Central Land, revering virtue,\nThe world praises, names echo through the ages.\nGrand rites of vast fortune,\nBlue petitions presented to the Sage,\nResponses rarely met.\nWenshan’s rites,\nWhite turtle, lotus—supporting Ancestor Wang.\n\n---\n\nLiving past Pengzu,\nHolding rank above the first grade,\nAs rich as Shi Chong.\nFrom ancient times to now, worldly affairs—\nRealizing their weightlessness.\nRetiring like Yuanming,\nSailing like Fan Li,\nAlready transcended.\nTruly mastering the Dao,\nEscaping the dark paths of death.\n\nCloud-steps to Penglai, Langyuan,\nImmortal lands never night,\nEach has its carefree abode.\nBeyond the Celestial Origin’s supreme Dao,\nA thousand years—hard to encounter.\nThe spark of life’s light,\nFoam’s birth and death,\nFlying crows following the hare.\nSwiftly cultivate life and nature,\nWise sages secretly guide you.\n\n---\n\nSitting in the azure pavilion’s quiet,\nSuddenly forgetting words,\nLeisurely perusing a thousand scrolls of poetry and books.\nPine path, staff in hand, truly clinging to the Dao,\nProfound, the celestial mechanism’s depth.\nBeyond the world, within the mortal realm,\nCapital’s clouds, cave’s radiance,\nWhen the wisdom-eye opens—seen.\nExistence and non-existence both dissolved,\nLaughing and chanting, floating life unjudged.\n\nThe households of Pang and Xu ascend,\nReturning to the Great Veil,\nEscaping the trade of bones, life and death.\nImmortal lands never night—no suffering,\nLangyuan’s jade pools, pure feasts.\nSeas turn to withered pines,\nEternal youth—no aging,\nWorldly falsity—no envy.\nSix-spun robes draped,\nAgain ascending to the Origin, revealed anew.\n\n---\n\nWeary of dwelling in the mortal world,\nLike a lone cloud drifting,\nA crane soaring to the heavens.\nUnfettered, unbound, beyond the void,\nLetting go—directly transcending the other shore.\nEverywhere home,\nZither and books as companions,\nFreely writing, chanting sighs.\nReclining in the grotto-heaven,\nLet others mock my laziness.\n\nSummer nears—hundred-foot pines tower,\nWater curtains roar,\nFlying into the Dragon Spring Gorge.\nThirst quenched with rosy nectar at immortal gatherings,\nYouths singing, lips and tongues loose.\nEscaping the wheel of rebirth,\nLife and nature perfected,\nThe deluded struggle to follow.\nForsaking fame, renouncing profit,\nLet others praise or blame at will.\n\n---\n\n*Water Dragon Chant*\n\nThis early winter of Xin-You,\nOn the full moon of the Lower Origin,\nSweet rain arrives.\nWheat sprouts flourish,\nRoots deep, stems firm,\nMore joy, fewer cares.\nClinging to the Dao—no disasters,\nSages protect—no suffering for beings.\nThe Celestial Origin nears its end,\nImmortals celebrate in assembly,\nMerits complete—\nAscend to the Origin.\n\nBeyond lies the celestial palace’s treasure,\nPerfected true
