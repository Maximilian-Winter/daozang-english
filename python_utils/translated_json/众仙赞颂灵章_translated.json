  "full_translation": "**Hymns of the Immortals: Sacred Eulogies**\n\n**Hymn of the Azure Radiance for Salvation from Suffering**\n\n*Morning Audience*\nThe Heavenly Worthy vows with boundless compassion,\nDelivering all realms and transforming good causes.\nThe Five Peaks and Four Offices all receive his decree,\nWhile Fengdu’s Northern Bureau halts its punishments.\nTrue talismans descend, granting universal pardon;\nDivine youths proclaim deliverance for the condemned.\nThe Primordial Beginning manifests in wondrous form,\nLiberating countless souls—only then is the Dao fulfilled.\n\n*Midday Audience*\nThe Heavenly Worthy pledges to ferry all beings,\nExpounding the Dharma in majesty beneath the jeweled grove.\nNine-headed lions display their auspicious signs,\nWhile wisdom’s light illumines the deepest shadows.\nBlade-mountains and sword-trees shatter and fall,\nFires, miasmas, winds, and thunder all cease.\nBoundless compassion descends to rescue and deliver—\nEven Fengdu’s hells behold his glory.\n\n*Evening Audience*\nThe Heavenly Worthy’s wisdom uplifts all souls,\nShattering iron citadels at the cry of suffering.\nVast salvation extends to the farthest bounds,\nHis radiance universally piercing the darkest depths.\nWhere the breeze of wisdom fans, flames vanish;\nWhere the Dharma-rain falls, decay blooms anew.\nBoundless mercy saves all—\nThe departed spirits all behold the Merciful One.\n\n**Lady of Supreme Perfection’s Farewell to Ma Mingsheng**\n\nFor a time, I leave the walled city,\nCommanding my chariot to Mount Tai’s slopes.\nGazing up at the Great Clarity’s gates,\nCloud-palaces rise in towering splendor.\nWithin the void dwells the Perfected One,\nComing and going in wondrous array.\nRefining form to preserve the natural,\nRising and bowing to embrace Great Harmony.\nEach dawn, the Nine Heavenly Kings,\nEach dusk, I lodge in Western Florescence.\nEssence flows, enabling flight,\nInhaling and exhaling to nurture the verdant sprouts.\nThe supreme elixir is not gold or stone,\nYet the wind sings of its own accord.\nAbove and below, I soar through luminous skies,\nMy feathered robes swaying in dance.\nThe Five Peaks are not my chambers,\nThe Dark Capital is my true home.\nBelow, I see the striving mortals,\nAs foolish as frogs and toads.\nGlancing at the dust-laden world,\nTheir woes entangle them endlessly.\nIf they have not awakened to the wondrous truth,\nWhy trouble themselves with carving and polishing?\nDisaster gathers when the Dao is leaked,\nBut secrecy and caution bring abundant blessings.\nOnce born in the Palace of Kunling,\nWe discoursed on prolonging heaven’s years.\nThough golden nectar grants long life,\nIt cannot compare to the immortals of Great Harmony.\nI ascend the ethereal immortal terrace,\nIn empty reverie chanting to the divine beings.\nSuddenly, I meet the King of Fusang,\nThe Nine Elders, Perfected of the Immortal Capital.\nHis purple dragon-chariot arrives,\nHis sacred countenance so resplendent.\nHe urges me to seek the long journey,\nInviting me to the ford of spontaneity.\nHe reveals the art of soaring flight,\nBestows upon me the *Jade Embryo Canon*.\nJadelike essence congeals primordial *qi*,\nThe White Maiden expounds it for me.\nBending, I draw the fat of the numinous phoenix;\nRising, I ascend the Three Heavens.\nCloud-nets mark your steps—\nThe Five Peaks may be briefly circled.\nHow distant is the Dark Capital?\nPenglai lies beneath your feet.\nTransmission and reception foster love,\nBonding as immortals and celestial beings.\nGuard it well, and you wander free of judgment;\nDisaster spares neither fool nor sage.\nKeep it secret, and you enjoy eternal stability;\nReveal it, and your body and life collapse.\n\n**Ode of the Right Radiant Lady of Cloud Forest**\n**Ode of Yang the Perfected to Director Xu**\n\n**Ode of the Right Radiant Lady of Cloud Forest**\n**Ode of Yang the Perfected to Director Xu**\n\nSwiftly I chariot through the Eight Voids,\nTurning to feast in the Eastern Flowery Chamber.\nThe Celestial Mother invites me to her terrace,\nClear-voiced, I tread the numinous wind.\nI came with purpose awaiting,\nThus I crossed the Azure Waves.\nSoaring, I mount the cloud-lit axle;\nFloating, I gaze upon the rosy void above.\nThe cloud-carriage dances free,\nThe purple canopy cradles the sacred realm.\nCrimson mists coil the banners,\nFeathered robes fan fragrant winds.\nThunder roars, fierce beasts howl,\nLightning hums, the dark dragon stirs.\nJade flutes resound in the courtyard,\nGolden chimes sing to the divine bell.\nI pluck magic mushrooms by the Azure Waves,\nGather blossoms on the Eightfold Pure Peaks.\nMy crimson countenance renews daily,\nThough eons pass, I remain a child.\nNurturing form in the eastern stillness,\nThe Seven Spirits commune as one.\nYet worldly dust bears sorrow,\nFelling my white-haired elder.\nLong have I sighed in distant gloom,\nRegretting not fleeing sooner.\nI halt my chariot as the Moon’s Charioteer moves,\nTurn my wheels back to the Azure Waves.\nNever have I glimpsed such a one’s wanderings,\nYet fleetingly I wonder—how might I find peace?\nAwaiting the verdant spring,\nI shall unburden my heart’s forgetting.\n\nI rein in the light, floating through purple mist,\nBeholding the Eight Sceneries upon the Fen’s flow.\nFeathered youths bear jade nectar,\nJade blossoms feast on numinous fat.\nWe pledge by the White Water’s edge,\nRaising my withered pearl.\nThe Azure Chamber gleams with eastern dawn,\nThe Purple Creation drifts in crimson morn.\nTwin virtues uphold the Dao’s essence,\nFortifying the Perfected Lord’s domain.\nThe Eight Terraces lie before my gaze,\nNorthward, I see naught but soaring void.\nIn cloud-borne clarity, I watch,\nDimly treading the shifting light.\nExhaling the Dongling’s splendor,\nHiding my radiance in the eastern hills.\nLong have I dwelled among mortal affairs,\nYet never a moment idle.\nHow unlike the ease of transforming my form,\nReturning to this childlike face.\n\nAt dawn, the Great Rosy Palace rises,\nJade chambers ascend in celestial purity.\nI chant the Three Wondrous Visions,\nFloating light soars through the utmost void.\nCinnabar blossoms bloom in the heavens,\nGolden reflections nurture vital essence.\nThe Eight Winds stir brocade robes,\nVerdant trees illumine the Four Numinous Ones.\nThe floral canopy shades orchid radiance,\nPurple reins urge the green carriage.\nPledging faith, I commune with spirits,\nTouching all with celestial sincerity.\nWhy seek outward signs?\nSoon you shall behold jade and jasper.\nThe Three Sceneries flourish in dark mystery,\nDawn’s glow brightens the Eight Directions.\nCrimson clouds float above the high palace,\nCarefree, I ride the numinous wind.\nFlapping wings, I mount the white whirlwind,\nRising to gaze within the jade terrace.\nThe green canopy enters the harmonious dawn,\nThe azure carriage hurls through empty space.\nTo the right, I bow to the Eastern Grove’s Emperor,\nAscending to court the Great Void’s Sovereign.\nJade guests carve phoenix brain,\nRoaring, we drink the flying elixir.\nCloud hooks coil in the winding chamber,\nA thousand notes ring clear and resonant.\nBrocade banners summon fierce beasts,\nFloral pennants sway and dip.\nFragrant mothers bend in song,\nPurple mists part the rafters.\nI gather reins at the lofty pure gate,\nLoose my chariot in the fair one’s chamber.\n\nOf old, fate’s signs lay hidden,\nSpiritual transformation followed *qi*’s flight.\nMy heart, distant, sensed the dark shore,\nYears passed like towering cedars.\nMy form, sullied, craved foul scents,\nMovement and stillness lost the Azure Waves.\nYet my friend is not thus—\nYesterday’s glory and shame are forgotten.\nCrimson light floats in the dark dawn,\nThe purple chariot rides the misty journey.\nAbove, I transcend the Green Gate’s depths,\nBelow, I gaze upon the Vermilion Fire City.\nEastern dawn unfurls vast radiance,\nDivine light illumines the Seven Numinous Ones.\nVeiled brilliance drifts like three torches,\nFlowing freely, I equal the void.\nWinds coil through the hollow universe,\nFragrant notes arise with each measure.\nHand in hand, I dance with the Weaving Maiden,\nShoulder to shoulder in the Gourd Court.\nTo the left, I circle the Azure Feather Banner,\nThe floral canopy follows the clouds’ tilt.\nFeasting beyond the Nine Degrees,\nRight and wrong no longer concern me.\nDrawing the true, I nest in the Great Stillness,\nMy golden form grows ever more childlike.\nHow unlike the defiled world,\nWhere life is bleak and joyless.\n\nFour banners gleam in the bright void,\nVermilion chariots fly to the numinous mound.\nThe jade canopy answers the Seven Sceneries,\nFlapping wings float above the clouds.\nNine notes resound in the purple void,\nJade chimes echo through the Great Nothingness.\nFeasting and chanting in the Three Dawn Palaces,\nSinging and calling to my kindred.\nUnnoticed, the cedar’s age has come,\nHow could I know the Two Lights’ flow?\nThough the fair one has forgotten all,\nA hundred sorrows remain uncast.\nThe long forest is truly still,\nThe cliffs hold many delights.\nNorthward, I ascend the Gate of Dark Perfection,\nHand in hand, we weave the lofty net.\nFragrant smoke scatters the Eight Sceneries,\nThe dark wind stirs the crimson waves.\nAbove, I transcend the Jasper Garden Ford,\nBelow, I gaze upon the Cloudy Mound’s slopes.\nJade flutes play above the clouds,\nPhoenix cries shake the Nine Distances.\nRiding *qi*, I float through the Great Void—\nWhy tread the mountain slopes?\nWith golden tally, I command the feathered spirits,\nLeading troops to vanquish ten thousand demons.\nTogether, we draw the twin dawn’s radiance,\nA thousand springs remain childlike.\nLosing the true, I plunged into the competitive world,\nHelpless, I could not fathom how.\nGazing upward at the Great Rosy Palace,\nThe golden pavilion gleams in purple purity.\nThe Flowery Chamber reflects the Great Simplicity,\nFour chariots all of vermilion jasper.\nHurling wheels through the hollow ford,\nGathering reins to dance the green carriage.\nJade blossoms fly like cloud canopies,\nThe Western Consort wields brocade banners.\nSuddenly, I turn from the dust’s filth,\nSwiftly entering the fair one’s court.\nLong-held feelings summon the Perfected’s descent,\nThe one I sought already dwells in darkness.\nRiding the wind, I play the dawn’s music,\nTogether we drink deep from the cinnabar grove’s urns.\nLords and nobles are but fleeting shadows—\nHow could they know the Perfected’s numinosity?\n\nAt dawn, I draw the crimson dawn,\nGathering *qi* to wander above the clouds.\nCircling the carriage through winding waves,\nI witness the world’s sorrows.\nWords and intent arise like lush growth,\nNot scattering the Three Magic Mushrooms.\nHow much better to roam the Dark Realm,\nStriking the chimes for your delight.\nYour heart knows no bounds—\nMy wish holds nothing within.\nReining in the light, I ascend the dawn,\nRoaming and feasting in the Azure Waves’ palace.\nColored clouds entwine the cinnabar dawn,\nDivine mists scatter into the void.\nThe Highest Perfected chant in the jade chamber,\nLofty immortals sing in the numinous hall.\nNine phoenixes sing the vermilion pipes,\nHollow notes mingle with feathered chimes.\nWe nest together in the Golden Court,\nBonding as friends in the dark.\nTogether, we draw from the jade nectar’s spring—\nIn a flash, we are children again.\nWhy crouch in the path’s way,\nLetting illness grow with each day?\nAt dawn, I wander the Great Simplicity’s palace,\nReining my carriage to gaze upon the Jade River.\nAt dusk, I feast in the secluded chamber,\nAt dawn, I pluck the round light’s blossoms.\nStriking the chimes on the Northern Cold Terrace,\nThe Seven Numinous Ones gleam with purple dawn.\nSolemnly, the lofty immortals rise,\nWhile dust-bound mortals weave their nets.\nI linger amidst the clamor and mist—\nMy transgressions should not be many.\nCharioting *qi*, I speed through the cloud carriage,\nAt dawn, I ascend the Great Tranquil Mound.\nThe Crimson Ford connects the trembling peaks,\nClear waves surge in the deep flow.\nStepping through the void, I observe the Nine Wefts—\nThe Eight Nets have all been traversed.\n\nBriefly I feast on the Three Gold’s bloom,\nThen come to observe the steadfast company.\nDiligence and sloth cannot conceal each other—\nThus a hundred sorrows accumulate.\nTreading waves, I cross the Azure Billows,\nSuddenly arriving at Golden Mountain.\nGazing all around, I wander the day long,\nYet few are the cloud-borne ones like me.\n\nPurple towers rise into the void,\nDark halls pierce the howling gales.\nJewels and jades adorn the numinous gardens,\nBlossoms of splendor weave into jasper and jade.\nI rein my carriage at the Azure Ford,\nThe Eight Winds stir the Cloud Shao.\nFanning the northern shade with feathered fans,\nI grasp the staff and sound the golden flute.\nPhoenix pipes harmonize with a thousand bells,\nWhile the Western Lads sing at dawn.\nMy heart opens beyond the void,\nMy spirit’s robe—how vast and bright!\n\nI whirl in dance on the Great Void Ridge,\nThe Six Qi turn through layered depths.\nHow could my path be traced,\nTo let you remain unwaning?\nDark waves churn the azure tides,\nVast fords surge with myriad streams.\nI chariot the light, gazing through the Six Voids,\nLonging to wander with the fair one.\nHer exquisite song does not answer me—\nTo whom may I offer my clear tones?\nShe wheels her jade carriage through the clouds—\nWhy should she hasten in the dust?\n\nPines □ grow on the Dark Ridge,\nThriving as frost-forest lords.\nLush blossoms flourish on stern ice,\nUnfearing of white snow.\nIn troubled times, deep within layered peaks,\nMy wandering life keeps the Dao ever pure.\nI fly these unbridled wheels,\nTracing the tracks of distant ones.\nLords and marquises may come and go—\nWhy can they not sever ties?\nI aspire to contend in the eastern hills,\nTo shade my light and nest in the numinous cave.\n\nHushed and still, the tranquil courtyard,\nShaded by verdant, dense woods.\nThe round radiance gleams through the southern window,\nThe Crimson Wind fans the secluded chamber.\nWithin the quiet room, I clasp my robe,\nTogether we vow to unlock the wondrous art.\nVast and bright, my thoughts reach the profound,\nDesolate and free, my spirit’s heart takes flight.\nI give free rein to my heart through the empty ford,\nTempering my reins, urging the crimson carriage.\nWhy does the fair one come so late?\nWhen will the foremost virtue be achieved?\n\nParables must be heeded—\nTo ignore them is heartless.\nHow may I chariot fleeting traces\nTo seek this cloud-borne spirit?\nSubtle tones bear true meaning—\nGuard them well, do not take them lightly.\nAffairs align with the divine mechanism—\nPreserve yourself to witness great peace.\n\nI rein the light down to the Azure Billows,\nLeaping across the Green Sea’s ford.\nCrimson mists swirl through the Great Yang,\nFeathered canopies tilt the Nine Heavens.\nThe cloud carriage floats through the void,\nIn an instant, between the azure waves.\nI come to seek friends in the realm of truth,\nTo join hands and attend the Emperor at dawn.\n\nThe Jade Youths harmonize with luminous virtue,\nTogether they summon the jade sages.\nBelow, they gaze upon the Eight River Palace,\nAbove, they repose on the peaks of the Rare Grove.\nSipping this purple jade’s richness,\nOnly then do they know the toil of the filthy path.\nWhere now is the fair one?\nOnly through diligence may one draw near.\n\nCrimson towers part the vast skies,\nI push through the vermilion gates to ascend the light-chamber.\nPurple banners flutter in the clouds,\nThe Feathered Dawn dances the Eight Winds.\nI halt my canopy by the emerald stream,\nGathering blossoms on the Moon-Sustaining Peak.\nI chew the Three Numinous Blossoms,\nInhaling and exhaling the Nine Spirit Rays.\nThe count of spring trees knows no end,\nHarmonizing with the sun, nurturing the young and ignorant.\n\nHand in hand, we enter the Hall of Luminous Truth,\nLooking up to await the Supreme Emperor.\nThe Northern Hook sings with the Feathered Ones,\nJade and mystery dazzle the assembly of worthies.\nThe music ends.\n\nWhy, in this world of waves and billows,\nDo gain and loss toll for me?\nI crane my neck within the clamorous court,\nOpening my heart to the filth’s onslaught.\nHabituated to the realm of glory and disgrace,\nRarely do I tread the Rare Grove’s palace.\nIs a moment’s stillness truly so bitter?\nTry departing to gaze upon the Azure Billows.\n\nWorldly treasures mingle in fragrant exchange,\nThe Dao’s lineage convenes in the dark skies.\nI shake my robes to seek the true domain,\nTurning my carriage at the edge of wind and dust.\nVirtue shines with dark radiance,\nSharpness gathers in flourishing splendor.\nSecret words bring abundant blessings,\nSerene stillness esteems true nobility.\nEver should the two images be followed,\nHand in hand, sharing the same sash.\nWhy, amidst human affairs,\nDo troubles arise daily?\n\nWith heart I promise the axe-bearer,\nSaying, “I shall gather the five mushrooms.”\n“If you do not find the mushroom grass,\nYou too cannot come.”\n“If you come, you may find it—\nThe mushroom grass shall be yours to eat.”\n\n*In Praise of the Supreme Lord’s Scripture of Wisdom and the True One*\n\nTo learn immortality, sever worldly thoughts,\nEach thought building upon the last.\nComing and going disturb my spirit,\nRestless, it traverses all.\nExtinguish thoughts, dwell in empty stillness,\nWhispering into the void’s silence.\nSeek the scripture as if parched with thirst,\nHold fast to your resolve like metal and stone.\nPreserve your childlike spirit on the dark flight,\nThe Five Spirits pass through talismanic registers.\nCross me over the Six Perfections,\nThus may I untie the Three Nets.\n\nPurify with fasting, worship the Great Simplicity,\nExhale and inhale to nurture the cloud-teeth.\nRoaming within the Golden Towers,\nJade Capital is my home.\nNaturally, the Seven Treasures arise,\nEach person seated upon a lotus.\nAbove, I chew the dark metropolis’s fruit,\nBelow, I hold the empty ford’s wild rice.\nMy countenance shines like ten suns,\nWhy reckon the eons’ multitude?\n\nThe Dharma drum summons the heavenly immortals,\nThe ringing bell subdues the great demons.\nThe numinous wind fans fragrant blossoms,\nResplendent, unfolding the lush robes.\nThe Supreme Truth strokes the cloud zither,\nThe assembled immortals pluck the spirit harp.\nElegant songs resound in the Three Heavens,\nDispersing wisdom in the Jade Flower Grove.\nSeven ancestors ascend the Hall of Blessings,\nThus they tread the dark tones.\n\nIf past lives’ virtue was insufficient,\nThis scripture remains distant and hard to find.\nIf faith in the Dao is not wholehearted,\nAspiring to flight only leads to sinking.\nThe Supreme Lord’s effortless Dao\nExpands within the hearts of all beings.\nTo learn the Dao, trust sincerely,\nRevere your teacher as your closest kin.\nBow to the light, pair with the pure void,\nDiligently renewing with each passing day.\n\nUntil all people are delivered,\nI shall not deliver myself.\nGreat vows demand profound repayment,\nDark virtue is wholly trustworthy.\nHidden evils and deep sins\nConfront one like a turning wheel.\nTo learn the Dao is also bitter,\nMorning and night, cultivate the field of blessings.\nPlanting virtue is like planting trees—\nDeep roots yield abundant fruit.\nIf you can delight in the profound,\nYou shall soar to the clear heavens.\n\nCultivate this effortless Dao,\nAnd you shall form bonds with the good.\nThe Supreme Lord expounds the ultimate Dao,\nThe scriptures and books of wisdom.\nTo lift suffering requires great talent,\nTo transcend the mundane is to attain truth.\nYour spirit’s bearing is rare in this world,\nGlowing like a lotus in the deep.\nEach person’s conduct has its roots,\nAll stemming from past lives’ merit.\nTo establish virtue, act in due time,\nMake vows—none shall go unanswered.\nGood and evil both await their recompense,\nThe principle of rise and fall is unfathomable.\n\nWorthy ones uphold the Dharma’s words,\nVirtue and power lie in forgetting both.\nTo comprehend this is great wisdom,\nTo ascend as the Supreme Pole Lord.\nJewel canopies link to jade carriages,\nCommanding the chariot, driving the nine dragons.\nGolden blossoms hold the Cavern Scripture,\nFragrant incense is borne by all the immortal lads.\nWhistling and singing, they reach the Dark Metropolis,\nStriking jade, knocking upon jade bells.\n\n*In Praise of Wu Zi’s Portrait*\n\nUnworthy Wu Zi,\nKnowing fate, he follows truth,\nHis aspiration lies in the profound and plain,\nHis heart delights in pure poverty.\nHe traverses the myriad mountains,\nA minnow-like solitary self.\nHis learning has not yet illuminated the Dao,\nHis form merely preserves the spirit.\nMountains and waters are his home,\nHis shadow and form his neighbors.\nClad in cloth robes and grass belts,\nDeer-hide caps and gauze kerchiefs,\nHe feeds on pine seeds and drinks from springs,\nCrossing Shu, passing Qin.\nThe Great Dao is dim and distant—\nWho is my teacher?\nGazing upon the world below,\nHe longs for those celestial guests.\nHis yearning knows no end,\nVague and formless, yet ever near.\n\nAll day in his thatched hall at ease,\nThe clear wind comes and goes.\nHis ears untroubled by worldly affairs,\nHis heart at play with drifting clouds.\nFacing wine, he thinks only of the moon,\nFeasting on pine, he never tires of mountains.\nOften chanting *Neijing*,\nNaturally preserving a youthful face.\n\nThis life, these things—his livelihood,\nWhite stones and green pines his home.\nLying beneath the moon, nestled in clouds like a wild deer,\nOften buying wine to intoxicate with mist and rosy clouds.\nSecluded in solitary wandering,\nA minnow-like lone figure,\nHe drinks the fallen dew of magnolia,\nClothes himself in the shed feathers of black cranes.\nSeeking no profit in the human world,\nRenouncing fame beneath the heavens—\nSuch is the Daoist who dwells in mountains.\nHaving inscribed this, he shakes his robes, gathers his staff, and departs,\nNone know where he has gone.\n\n*The Immortal Bestows the Ode of Everlasting Years*\nIn clear autumn, with nothing to do,\nHe rides the mist to distant skies.\nRelying on a woodcutter’s words,\nHe pledges to meet in everlasting years.\n\n*Li Gongzuo’s Poem for the Immortal’s Servant*\nI possess a pearl within my robe,\nUnbothered by the dust upon it.\nI hold the principle of long life,\nUnwearied by this embodied form.\nIn the divine grottoes of Jiangnan,\nI shall merge with their truth.\nUnashamed of marketplace bonds,\nI come to save the world’s people.\nSu Zi’s traces are gone,\nYet the simple and ignorant may still draw near.\nSay not the Eastern Sea has changed—\nHeaven and earth endure in eternal spring.\n\n*Ju Haoran’s \"Ode to Drifting the Empty Boat\"*\nWhen traveling, clouds are my companions,\nWhen seated, wine is my friend.\nMy belly is filled with the unchanging,\nMy robes patched with clouds and rosy dawn.\nJie’s tyranny and Yao’s benevolence—\nAlas, both have turned to dust.\nOars and paddles need no aid,\nFreely drifting like duckweed.\nAt dawn, floating in the radiance of the rising sun,\nAt dusk, shaded by the clear moon’s glow.\nThose who toil for merit and fame—\nTheir bones crumble into mud and sand.\nHaving drunk Ju’s wine,\nI board Ju’s boat once more.\nThus is the spirit purified,\nTranscendent and carefree, without sorrow.\n\n*The Ode of the Mysterious Echo*\nThis echo is no valley’s sound,\nMy heart knows it is from divine immortals.\nNever leaving my ears,\nHigh and low like autumn cicadas.\nAt night, its voice grows urgent,\nBy day, it softens.\nThe divine repels all evil,\nGranting me the might of the wind.\nThis wondrous sound knows no pause,\nDay and night, it endlessly revolves.\nNot by chance—\nA messenger from the celestial realms descends.\nHow to discern its divine response?\nOne must find a ladder and mediator.\nSince the mysterious echo arrived,\nIt is as if a true immortal has come.\nThe thought lingers in my heart,\nTurning and turning without cease.\nHow lovely the crisp, refreshing night—\nListening in stillness to the autumn cicadas’ song.\n\n*The Immortals’ \"Ode of Treading the Void\"*\nFloating, floating, they ascend the clouded path,\nDimly vanishing into the endless dawn.\nThe starry palaces grow ever distant,\nThe kalpas of time stretch far.\nGazing up, the golden countenance of virtue is hidden,\nLonging turns to await the divine whirlwind.\nWould that I could ride the rosy dawn’s wings,\nBurn incense and bow in reverent audience.\n\nThe mystic wind turns the flying canopy,\nPurple qi suffuses the immortal’s chariot.\nFloating in the void without need of steeds,\nSuddenly they ascend into nothingness.\nLingering, they lament the world below,\nGlancing back to pity the multitudes.\nThe true transformation of the Three Origins complete,\nA minnow-like figure enters the Great Void.\nMyriad qi float upward,\nA thousand lights merge with the Supreme Subtlety.\nGazing from the heavens at the canopies of flowers,\nIn the emptiness, they behold the rosy-hued robes.\nTrue forms enter the clouded path,\nOrbs of radiance follow the wind in flight.\nWould that I might attend the Three Origins’ assembly,\nTo return borne by the golden countenance’s motion.\n\nAuspicious light soars with purple qi,\nThe celestial path glides through cinnabar skies.\nBanners wave, turning the fragrant wind,\nCanopies stir, surpassing floating mist.\nWithin the Dao, there is still the Dao,\nWithin the profound, there is yet the profound.\nThe true light knows no bounds,\nThe Great Dao ultimately has no form.\nThe Dharma Wheel turns of itself,\nThe subtle sound cannot be heard.\nIn emptiness, awaiting the Three Treasures,\nIn the void, hearing the *Cavern Scripture*.\nSeven transformations, the wandering soul returns,\nMyriad qi arrest the decline of years.\nFragrant winds waft the feathered canopy,\nFloating qi turn the whirlwind chariot,\nCold and clear, they ascend the clouded path,\nFaint and distant, they enter the endless void.\nGazing back, they pity the dust-bound mortals,\nIn due time, they expound the sacred scriptures.\nThe wondrous fruit harmonizes with this day,\nThe profound accord naturally aligns.\n\n*The Great Lord of the Azure Youth Often Chants*\nTo plant the roots of extinction,\nOne must uproot the seeds of life and death.\nSighing, one sinks into the Nine Springs—\nAll for clinging to this bodily form.\n\n*The Lady of Southern Marchmount’s Composition for Prefect Xu*\nThe numinous valley’s elegant ripples coil,\nHiding her form, she dwells in the mountain’s capital.\nClad in coarse cloth, equal to dragon-robes,\nGirded in plain silk, matching jade pendants.\nHer form roams the distant and secluded,\nHer spirit soars in the rosy dawn’s court.\nAbove the heavens, there are steps of worthies,\nIn the void, there are true voices.\nGazing up, I ride the winding morning flight,\nFollowing this green-hued carriage.\nLooking down upon the Eight Degrees,\nI sigh at the world’s dust and coils.\nLiberated from the waves’ entanglement,\nI ascend this distant, distant self.\nAnxieties end as the Three Fordings dry,\nThe rush of time severs your fleeting years.\n\n*The Lady of Southern Marchmount’s Composition*\nBeyond wondrous images, the profound resonance calls itself.\nCloud-script swirls in the purple dawn,\nOrchid winds fan the green-hued carriage.\nThe Supreme Ones feast in the jade terrace,\nFar removed as the standard of earthly immortals.\nWhat they await is noble and far-reaching,\nThus they excel in outstanding brilliance.\nDelighting in those Eight Pure Writings,\nThe Dao is perfected in the Six Distant Realms.\nHow can worldly affairs be foreseen?\nThey cause your form and qi to dissipate.\n\n*The Immortals’ Hymns of Praise and Laud Conclude*\n*(These poems and texts may be found in *The Seven Bamboo Tablets of the Cloudy Satchel*, fascicles 98 and 99.)*",

Flowery Chamber.\nThe Celestial Mother invites me to her terrace,\nClear-voiced, I tread the numinous wind.\nI came with purpose awaiting,\nThus I crossed the Azure Waves.\nSoaring, I mount the cloud-lit axle;\nFloating, I gaze upon the rosy void above.\nThe cloud-carriage dances free,\nThe purple canopy cradles the sacred realm.\nCrimson mists coil the banners,\nFeathered robes fan fragrant winds.\nThunder roars, fierce beasts howl,\nLightning hums, the dark dragon stirs.\nJade flutes resound in the courtyard,\nGolden chimes sing to the divine bell.\nI pluck magic mushrooms by the Azure Waves,\nGather blossoms on the Eightfold Pure Peaks.\nMy crimson countenance renews daily,\nThough eons pass, I remain a child.\nNurturing form in the eastern stillness,\nThe Seven Spirits commune as one.\nYet worldly dust bears sorrow,\nFelling my white-haired elder.\nLong have I sighed in distant gloom,\nRegretting not fleeing sooner.\nI halt my chariot as the Moon’s Charioteer moves,\nTurn my wheels back to the Azure Waves.\nNever have I glimpsed such a one’s wanderings,\nYet fleetingly I wonder—how might I find peace?\nAwaiting the verdant spring,\nI shall unburden my heart’s forgetting.\n\nI rein in the light, floating through purple mist,\nBeholding the Eight Sceneries upon the Fen’s flow.\nFeathered youths bear jade nectar,\nJade blossoms feast on numinous fat.\nWe pledge by the White Water’s edge,\nRaising my withered pearl.\nThe Azure Chamber gleams with eastern dawn,\nThe Purple Creation drifts in crimson morn.\nTwin virtues uphold the Dao’s essence,\nFortifying the Perfected Lord’s domain.\nThe Eight Terraces lie before my gaze,\nNorthward, I see naught but soaring void.\nIn cloud-borne clarity, I watch,\nDimly treading the shifting light.\nExhaling the Dongling’s splendor,\nHiding my radiance in the eastern hills.\nLong have I dwelled among mortal affairs,\nYet never a moment idle.\nHow unlike the ease of transforming my form,\nReturning to this childlike face.\n\nAt dawn, the Great Rosy Palace rises,\nJade chambers ascend in celestial purity.\nI chant the Three Wondrous Visions,\nFloating light soars through the utmost void.\nCinnabar blossoms bloom in the heavens,\nGolden reflections nurture vital essence.\nThe Eight Winds stir brocade robes,\nVerdant trees illumine the Four Numinous Ones.\nThe floral canopy shades orchid radiance,\nPurple reins urge the green carriage.\nPledging faith, I commune with spirits,\nTouching all with celestial sincerity.\nWhy seek outward signs?\nSoon you shall behold jade and jasper.\nThe Three Sceneries flourish in dark mystery,\nDawn’s glow brightens the Eight Directions.\nCrimson clouds float above the high palace,\nCarefree, I ride the numinous wind.\nFlapping wings, I mount the white whirlwind,\nRising to gaze within the jade terrace.\nThe green canopy enters the harmonious dawn,\nThe azure carriage hurls through empty space.\nTo the right, I bow to the Eastern Grove’s Emperor,\nAscending to court the Great Void’s Sovereign.\nJade guests carve phoenix brain,\nRoaring, we drink the flying elixir.\nCloud hooks coil in the winding chamber,\nA thousand notes ring clear and resonant.\nBrocade banners summon fierce beasts,\nFloral pennants sway and dip.\nFragrant mothers bend in song,\nPurple mists part the rafters.\nI gather reins at the lofty pure gate,\nLoose my chariot in the fair one’s chamber.\n\nOf old, fate’s signs lay hidden,\nSpiritual transformation followed *qi*’s flight.\nMy heart, distant, sensed the dark shore,\nYears passed like towering cedars.\nMy form, sullied, craved foul scents,\nMovement and stillness lost the Azure Waves.\nYet my friend is not thus—\nYesterday’s glory and shame are forgotten.\nCrimson light floats in the dark dawn,\nThe purple chariot rides the misty journey.\nAbove, I transcend the Green Gate’s depths,\nBelow, I gaze upon the Vermilion Fire City.\nEastern dawn unfurls vast radiance,\nDivine light illumines the Seven Numinous Ones.\nVeiled brilliance drifts like three torches,\nFlowing freely, I equal the void.\nWinds coil through the hollow universe,\nFragrant notes arise with each measure.\nHand in hand, I dance with the Weaving Maiden,\nShoulder to shoulder in the Gourd Court.\nTo the left, I circle the Azure Feather Banner,\nThe floral canopy follows the clouds’ tilt.\nFeasting beyond the Nine Degrees,\nRight and wrong no longer concern me.\nDrawing the true, I nest in the Great Stillness,\nMy golden form grows ever more childlike.\nHow unlike the defiled world,\nWhere life is bleak and joyless.\n\nFour banners gleam in the bright void,\nVermilion chariots fly to the numinous mound.\nThe jade canopy answers the Seven Sceneries,\nFlapping wings float above the clouds.\nNine notes resound in the purple void,\nJade chimes echo through the Great Nothingness.\nFeasting and chanting in the Three Dawn Palaces,\nSinging and calling to my kindred.\nUnnoticed, the cedar’s age has come,\nHow could I know the Two Lights’ flow?\nThough the fair one has forgotten all,\nA hundred sorrows remain uncast.\nThe long forest is truly still,\nThe cliffs hold many delights.\nNorthward, I ascend the Gate of Dark Perfection,\nHand in hand, we weave the lofty net.\nFragrant smoke scatters the Eight Sceneries,\nThe dark wind stirs the crimson waves.\nAbove, I transcend the Jasper Garden Ford,\nBelow, I gaze upon the Cloudy Mound’s slopes.\nJade flutes play above the clouds,\nPhoenix cries shake the Nine Distances.\nRiding *qi*, I float through the Great Void—\nWhy tread the mountain slopes?\nWith golden tally, I command the feathered spirits,\nLeading troops to vanquish ten thousand demons.\nTogether, we draw the twin dawn’s radiance,\nA thousand springs remain childlike.\nLosing the true, I plunged into the competitive world,\nHelpless, I could not fathom how.\nGazing upward at the Great Rosy Palace,\nThe golden pavilion gleams in purple purity.\nThe Flowery Chamber reflects the Great Simplicity,\nFour chariots all of vermilion jasper.\nHurling wheels through the hollow ford,\nGathering reins to dance the green carriage.\nJade blossoms fly like cloud canopies,\nThe Western Consort wields brocade banners.\nSuddenly, I turn from the dust’s filth,\nSwiftly entering the fair one’s court.\nLong-held feelings summon the Perfected’s descent,\nThe one I sought already dwells in darkness.\nRiding the wind, I play the dawn’s music,\nTogether we drink deep from the cinnabar grove’s urns.\nLords and nobles are but fleeting shadows—\nHow could they know the Perfected’s numinosity?\n\nAt dawn, I draw the crimson dawn,\nGathering *qi* to wander above the clouds.\nCircling the carriage through winding waves,\nI witness the world’s sorrows.\nWords and intent arise like lush growth,\nNot scattering the Three Magic Mushrooms.\nHow much better to roam the Dark Realm,\nStriking the chimes for your delight.\nYour heart knows no bounds—\nMy wish holds nothing within.\nReining in the light, I ascend the dawn,\nRoaming and feasting in the Azure Waves’ palace.\nColored clouds entwine the cinnabar dawn,\nDivine mists scatter into the void.\nThe Highest Perfected chant in the jade chamber,\nLofty immortals sing in the numinous hall.\nNine phoenixes sing the vermilion pipes,\nHollow notes mingle with feathered chimes.\nWe nest together in the Golden Court,\nBonding as friends in the dark.\nTogether, we draw from the jade nectar’s spring—\nIn a flash, we are children again.\nWhy crouch in the path’s way,\nLetting illness grow with each day?\nAt dawn, I wander the Great Simplicity’s palace,\nReining my carriage to gaze upon the Jade River.\nAt dusk, I feast in the secluded chamber,\nAt dawn, I pluck the round light’s blossoms.\nStriking the chimes on the Northern Cold Terrace,\nThe Seven Numinous Ones gleam with purple dawn.\nSolemnly, the lofty immortals rise,\nWhile dust-bound mortals weave their nets.\nI linger amidst the clamor and mist—\nMy transgressions should not be many.\nCharioting *qi*, I speed through the cloud carriage,\nAt dawn, I ascend the Great Tranquil Mound.\nThe Crimson Ford connects the trembling peaks,\nClear waves surge in the deep flow.\nStepping through the void, I observe the Nine Wefts—\nThe Eight Nets have all been traversed.",

      "translated_text": "Briefly I feast on the Three Gold’s bloom,\nThen come to observe the steadfast company.\nDiligence and sloth cannot conceal each other—\nThus a hundred sorrows accumulate.\nTreading waves, I cross the Azure Billows,\nSuddenly arriving at Golden Mountain.\nGazing all around, I wander the day long,\nYet few are the cloud-borne ones like me.\n\nPurple towers rise into the void,\nDark halls pierce the howling gales.\nJewels and jades adorn the numinous gardens,\nBlossoms of splendor weave into jasper and jade.\nI rein my carriage at the Azure Ford,\nThe Eight Winds stir the Cloud Shao.\nFanning the northern shade with feathered fans,\nI grasp the staff and sound the golden flute.\nPhoenix pipes harmonize with a thousand bells,\nWhile the Western Lads sing at dawn.\nMy heart opens beyond the void,\nMy spirit’s robe—how vast and bright!\n\nI whirl in dance on the Great Void Ridge,\nThe Six Qi turn through layered depths.\nHow could my path be traced,\nTo let you remain unwaning?\nDark waves churn the azure tides,\nVast fords surge with myriad streams.\nI chariot the light, gazing through the Six Voids,\nLonging to wander with the fair one.\nHer exquisite song does not answer me—\nTo whom may I offer my clear tones?\nShe wheels her jade carriage through the clouds—\nWhy should she hasten in the dust?\n\nPines □ grow on the Dark Ridge,\nThriving as frost-forest lords.\nLush blossoms flourish on stern ice,\nUnfearing of white snow.\nIn troubled times, deep within layered peaks,\nMy wandering life keeps the Dao ever pure.\nI fly these unbridled wheels,\nTracing the tracks of distant ones.\nLords and marquises may come and go—\nWhy can they not sever ties?\nI aspire to contend in the eastern hills,\nTo shade my light and nest in the numinous cave.\n\nHushed and still, the tranquil courtyard,\nShaded by verdant, dense woods.\nThe round radiance gleams through the southern window,\nThe Crimson Wind fans the secluded chamber.\nWithin the quiet room, I clasp my robe,\nTogether we vow to unlock the wondrous art.\nVast and bright, my thoughts reach the profound,\nDesolate and free, my spirit’s heart takes flight.\nI give free rein to my heart through the empty ford,\nTempering my reins, urging the crimson carriage.\nWhy does the fair one come so late?\nWhen will the foremost virtue be achieved?\n\nParables must be heeded—\nTo ignore them is heartless.\nHow may I chariot fleeting traces\nTo seek this cloud-borne spirit?\nSubtle tones bear true meaning—\nGuard them well, do not take them lightly.\nAffairs align with the divine mechanism—\nPreserve yourself to witness great peace.\n\nI rein the light down to the Azure Billows,\nLeaping across the Green Sea’s ford.\nCrimson mists swirl through the Great Yang,\nFeathered canopies tilt the Nine Heavens.\nThe cloud carriage floats through the void,\nIn an instant, between the azure waves.\nI come to seek friends in the realm of truth,\nTo join hands and attend the Emperor at dawn.\n\nThe Jade Youths harmonize with luminous virtue,\nTogether they summon the jade sages.\nBelow, they gaze upon the Eight River Palace,\nAbove, they repose on the peaks of the Rare Grove.\nSipping this purple jade’s richness,\nOnly then do they know the toil of the filthy path.\nWhere now is the fair one?\nOnly through diligence may one draw near.\n\nCrimson towers part the vast skies,\nI push through the vermilion gates to ascend the light-chamber.\nPurple banners flutter in the clouds,\nThe Feathered Dawn dances the Eight Winds.\nI halt my canopy by the emerald stream,\nGathering blossoms on the Moon-Sustaining Peak.\nI chew the Three Numinous Blossoms,\nInhaling and exhaling the Nine Spirit Rays.\nThe count of spring trees knows no end,\nHarmonizing with the sun, nurturing the young and ignorant.\n\nHand in hand, we enter the Hall of Luminous Truth,\nLooking up to await the Supreme Emperor.\nThe Northern Hook sings with the Feathered Ones,\nJade and mystery dazzle the assembly of worthies.\nThe music ends.\n\nWhy, in this world of waves and billows,\nDo gain and loss toll for me?\nI crane my neck within the clamorous court,\nOpening my heart to the filth’s onslaught.\nHabituated to the realm of glory and disgrace,\nRarely do I tread the Rare Grove’s palace.\nIs a moment’s stillness truly so bitter?\nTry departing to gaze upon the Azure Billows.\n\nWorldly treasures mingle in fragrant exchange,\nThe Dao’s lineage convenes in the dark skies.\nI shake my robes to seek the true domain,\nTurning my carriage at the edge of wind and dust.\nVirtue shines with dark radiance,\nSharpness gathers in flourishing splendor.\nSecret words bring abundant blessings,\nSerene stillness esteems true nobility.\nEver should the two images be followed,\nHand in hand, sharing the same sash.\nWhy, amidst human affairs,\nDo troubles arise daily?\n\nWith heart I promise the axe-bearer,\nSaying, “I shall gather the five mushrooms.”\n“If you do not find the mushroom grass,\nYou too cannot come.”\n“If you come, you may find it—\nThe mushroom grass shall be yours to eat.”\n\n*In Praise of the Supreme Lord’s Scripture of Wisdom and the True One*\n\nTo learn immortality, sever worldly thoughts,\nEach thought building upon the last.\nComing and going disturb my spirit,\nRestless, it traverses all.\nExtinguish thoughts, dwell in empty stillness,\nWhispering into the void’s silence.\nSeek the scripture as if parched with thirst,\nHold fast to your resolve like metal and stone.\nPreserve your childlike spirit on the dark flight,\nThe Five Spirits pass through talismanic registers.\nCross me over the Six Perfections,\nThus may I untie the Three Nets.\n\nPurify with fasting, worship the Great Simplicity,\nExhale and inhale to nurture the cloud-teeth.\nRoaming within the Golden Towers,\nJade Capital is my home.\nNaturally, the Seven Treasures arise,\nEach person seated upon a lotus.\nAbove, I chew the dark metropolis’s fruit,\nBelow, I hold the empty ford’s wild rice.\nMy countenance shines like ten suns,\nWhy reckon the eons’ multitude?\n\nThe Dharma drum summons the heavenly immortals,\nThe ringing bell subdues the great demons.\nThe numinous wind fans fragrant blossoms,\nResplendent, unfolding the lush robes.\nThe Supreme Truth strokes the cloud zither,\nThe assembled immortals pluck the spirit harp.\nElegant songs resound in the Three Heavens,\nDispersing wisdom in the Jade Flower Grove.\nSeven ancestors ascend the Hall of Blessings,\nThus they tread the dark tones.\n\nIf past lives’ virtue was insufficient,\nThis scripture remains distant and hard to find.\nIf faith in the Dao is not wholehearted,\nAspiring to flight only leads to sinking.\nThe Supreme Lord’s effortless Dao\nExpands within the hearts of all beings.\nTo learn the Dao, trust sincerely,\nRevere your teacher as your closest kin.\nBow to the light, pair with the pure void,\nDiligently renewing with each passing day.\n\nUntil all people are delivered,\nI shall not deliver myself.\nGreat vows demand profound repayment,\nDark virtue is wholly trustworthy.\nHidden evils and deep sins\nConfront one like a turning wheel.\nTo learn the Dao is also bitter,\nMorning and night, cultivate the field of blessings.\nPlanting virtue is like planting trees—\nDeep roots yield abundant fruit.\nIf you can delight in the profound,\nYou shall soar to the clear heavens.\n\nCultivate this effortless Dao,\nAnd you shall form bonds with the good.\nThe Supreme Lord expounds the ultimate Dao,\nThe scriptures and books of wisdom.\nTo lift suffering requires great talent,\nTo transcend the mundane is to attain truth.\nYour spirit’s bearing is rare in this world,\nGlowing like a lotus in the deep.\nEach person’s conduct has its roots,\nAll stemming from past lives’ merit.\nTo establish virtue, act in due time,\nMake vows—none shall go unanswered.\nGood and evil both await their recompense,\nThe principle of rise and fall is unfathomable.\n\nWorthy ones uphold the Dharma’s words,\nVirtue and power lie in forgetting both.\nTo comprehend this is great wisdom,\nTo ascend as the Supreme Pole Lord.\nJewel canopies link to jade carriages,\nCommanding the chariot, driving the nine dragons.\nGolden blossoms hold the Cavern Scripture,\nFragrant incense is borne by all the immortal lads.\nWhistling and singing, they reach the Dark Metropolis,\nStriking jade, knocking upon jade bells.\n\n*In Praise of Wu Zi’s Portrait*",

      "translated_text": "Unworthy Wu Zi,\nKnowing fate, he follows truth,\nHis aspiration lies in the profound and plain,\nHis heart delights in pure poverty.\nHe traverses the myriad mountains,\nA minnow-like solitary self.\nHis learning has not yet illuminated the Dao,\nHis form merely preserves the spirit.\nMountains and waters are his home,\nHis shadow and form his neighbors.\nClad in cloth robes and grass belts,\nDeer-hide caps and gauze kerchiefs,\nHe feeds on pine seeds and drinks from springs,\nCrossing Shu, passing Qin.\nThe Great Dao is dim and distant—\nWho is my teacher?\nGazing upon the world below,\nHe longs for those celestial guests.\nHis yearning knows no end,\nVague and formless, yet ever near.\n\nAll day in his thatched hall at ease,\nThe clear wind comes and goes.\nHis ears untroubled by worldly affairs,\nHis heart at play with drifting clouds.\nFacing wine, he thinks only of the moon,\nFeasting on pine, he never tires of mountains.\nOften chanting *Neijing*,\nNaturally preserving a youthful face.\n\nThis life, these things—his livelihood,\nWhite stones and green pines his home.\nLying beneath the moon, nestled in clouds like a wild deer,\nOften buying wine to intoxicate with mist and rosy clouds.\nSecluded in solitary wandering,\nA minnow-like lone figure,\nHe drinks the fallen dew of magnolia,\nClothes himself in the shed feathers of black cranes.\nSeeking no profit in the human world,\nRenouncing fame beneath the heavens—\nSuch is the Daoist who dwells in mountains.\nHaving inscribed this, he shakes his robes, gathers his staff, and departs,\nNone know where he has gone.\n\n*The Immortal Bestows the Ode of Everlasting Years*\nIn clear autumn, with nothing to do,\nHe rides the mist to distant skies.\nRelying on a woodcutter’s words,\nHe pledges to meet in everlasting years.\n\n*Li Gongzuo’s Poem for the Immortal’s Servant*\nI possess a pearl within my robe,\nUnbothered by the dust upon it.\nI hold the principle of long life,\nUnwearied by this embodied form.\nIn the divine grottoes of Jiangnan,\nI shall merge with their truth.\nUnashamed of marketplace bonds,\nI come to save the world’s people.\nSu Zi’s traces are gone,\nYet the simple and ignorant may still draw near.\nSay not the Eastern Sea has changed—\nHeaven and earth endure in eternal spring.\n\n*Ju Haoran’s \"Ode to Drifting the Empty Boat\"*\nWhen traveling, clouds are my companions,\nWhen seated, wine is my friend.\nMy belly is filled with the unchanging,\nMy robes patched with clouds and rosy dawn.\nJie’s tyranny and Yao’s benevolence—\nAlas, both have turned to dust.\nOars and paddles need no aid,\nFreely drifting like duckweed.\nAt dawn, floating in the radiance of the rising sun,\nAt dusk, shaded by the clear moon’s glow.\nThose who toil for merit and fame—\nTheir bones crumble into mud and sand.\nHaving drunk Ju’s wine,\nI board Ju’s boat once more.\nThus is the spirit purified,\nTranscendent and carefree, without sorrow.\n\n*The Ode of the Mysterious Echo*\nThis echo is no valley’s sound,\nMy heart knows it is from divine immortals.\nNever leaving my ears,\nHigh and low like autumn cicadas.\nAt night, its voice grows urgent,\nBy day, it softens.\nThe divine repels all evil,\nGranting me the might of the wind.\nThis wondrous sound knows no pause,\nDay and night, it endlessly revolves.\nNot by chance—\nA messenger from the celestial realms descends.\nHow to discern its divine response?\nOne must find a ladder and mediator.\nSince the mysterious echo arrived,\nIt is as if a true immortal has come.\nThe thought lingers in my heart,\nTurning and turning without cease.\nHow lovely the crisp, refreshing night—\nListening in stillness to the autumn cicadas’ song.\n\n*The Immortals’ \"Ode of Treading the Void\"*\nFloating, floating, they ascend the clouded path,\nDimly vanishing into the endless dawn.\nThe starry palaces grow ever distant,\nThe kalpas of time stretch far.\nGazing up, the golden countenance of virtue is hidden,\nLonging turns to await the divine whirlwind.\nWould that I could ride the rosy dawn’s wings,\nBurn incense and bow in reverent audience.\n\nThe mystic wind turns the flying canopy,\nPurple qi suffuses the immortal’s chariot.\nFloating in the void without need of steeds,\nSuddenly they ascend into nothingness.\nLingering, they lament the world below,\nGlancing back to pity the multitudes.\nThe true transformation of the Three Origins complete,\nA minnow-like figure enters the Great Void.\nMyriad qi float upward,\nA thousand lights merge with the Supreme Subtlety.\nGazing from the heavens at the canopies of flowers,\nIn the emptiness, they behold the rosy-hued robes.\nTrue forms enter the clouded path,\nOrbs of radiance follow the wind in flight.\nWould that I might attend the Three Origins’ assembly,\nTo return borne by the golden countenance’s motion.\n\nAuspicious light soars with purple qi,\nThe celestial path glides through cinnabar skies.\nBanners wave, turning the fragrant wind,\nCanopies stir, surpassing floating mist.\nWithin the Dao, there is still the Dao,\nWithin the profound, there is yet the profound.\nThe true light knows no bounds,\nThe Great Dao ultimately has no form.\nThe Dharma Wheel turns of itself,\nThe subtle sound cannot be heard.\nIn emptiness, awaiting the Three Treasures,\nIn the void, hearing the *Cavern Scripture*.\nSeven transformations, the wandering soul returns,\nMyriad qi arrest the decline of years.\nFragrant winds waft the feathered canopy,\nFloating qi turn the whirlwind chariot,\nCold and clear, they ascend the clouded path,\nFaint and distant, they enter the endless void.\nGazing back, they pity the dust-bound mortals,\nIn due time, they expound the sacred scriptures.\nThe wondrous fruit harmonizes with this day,\nThe profound accord naturally aligns.\n\n*The Great Lord of the Azure Youth Often Chants*\nTo plant the roots of extinction,\nOne must uproot the seeds of life and death.\nSighing, one sinks into the Nine Springs—\nAll for clinging to this bodily form.\n\n*The Lady of Southern Marchmount’s Composition for Prefect Xu*\nThe numinous valley’s elegant ripples coil,\nHiding her form, she dwells in the mountain’s capital.\nClad in coarse cloth, equal to dragon-robes,\nGirded in plain silk, matching jade pendants.\nHer form roams the distant and secluded,\nHer spirit soars in the rosy dawn’s court.\nAbove the heavens, there are steps of worthies,\nIn the void, there are true voices.\nGazing up, I ride the winding morning flight,\nFollowing this green-hued carriage.\nLooking down upon the Eight Degrees,\nI sigh at the world’s dust and coils.\nLiberated from the waves’ entanglement,\nI ascend this distant, distant self.\nAnxieties end as the Three Fordings dry,\nThe rush of time severs your fleeting years.\n\n*The Lady of Southern Marchmount’s Composition*\nBeyond wondrous images, the profound resonance calls itself.\nCloud-script swirls in the purple dawn,\nOrchid winds fan the green-hued carriage.\nThe Supreme Ones feast in the jade terrace,\nFar removed as the standard of earthly immortals.\nWhat they await is noble and far-reaching,\nThus they excel in outstanding brilliance.\nDelighting in those Eight Pure Writings,\nThe Dao is perfected in the Six Distant Realms.\nHow can worldly affairs be foreseen?\nThey cause your form and qi to dissipate.\n\n*The Immortals’ Hymns of Praise and Laud Conclude*\n*(These poems and texts may be found in *The Seven Bamboo Tablets of the Cloudy Satchel*, fascicles 98 and 99.)*",
