For ten months, the gestation swiftly progresses without pause. When the time of birth arrives, their limbs and vessels dissolve in agony.

If they dedicate merit to the deceased, performing feasts for seven sevens (forty-nine days), reciting sacred texts to aid the departed’s consciousness, they shall not traverse the paths of suffering but ascend to heaven, their bodies arriving at the Jade Capital, their spirits roaming the Golden Towers. Should their parents suffer from lingering illness, the establishment of a ritual arena (daochang) and the cultivation of Daoist rites will restore them to health, as if never afflicted. If their parents face peril—imprisonment, malevolent spirits, venomous creatures, or nightmares—let them reverently purify their minds, recite the Dao, and perform feasts; thus shall calamities recede, and demonic influences vanish. On the day of their birth, let them silently recall their parents’ kindness in giving them life, diligently observe precepts, and widely cultivate good deeds to repay their toil. Those who uphold these practices shall avoid the dark paths and be born into right awakening.\n\nYou must follow and proclaim this teaching, disseminate this scripture, and never allow slander or disbelief to arise, lest one incur immeasurable transgressions.\"\n\nWhen Superior Wisdom and the assembled celestial host heard these words, they rejoiced and leapt with delight, declaring: \"If we encounter such devotees, we shall all protect and shelter them, that they may receive joy and gaze upon the Celestial Worthy without end.\"\n\nThen they spoke this verse:\n\nThe supremely compassionate, peerless Worthy,\nTrue father and mother of all beings.\nWho expounds this scripture on repaying kindness—\nAll who hear it shall awaken.\nThose who diligently receive and uphold it\nShall soon ascend the immortal’s path.\nA mere fraction of praise, a hair’s tip of merit—\nWe bow our heads and depart in homage to the Celestial Worthy.\n\nHere ends *The Scripture on the Supreme Perfection of the True One’s Repayment of Parents’ Profound Kindness*.",
