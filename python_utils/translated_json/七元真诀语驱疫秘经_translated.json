Author unknown. Two scriptures bound as one volume. Source text: *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, Orthodox Section, Part One.\n\n---\n\nThe Dao speaks: In the kalpa of Dragon Han, when the reckoning of chaos was exhausted, the essence of the Seven Primordials congealed. All possessed sacred books and secret formulas, emerging at the dawn of Dragon Han. The Black Emperor of the North wielded the method of subduing ghosts, manifesting divine merit across a realm called Yudan, where the registers of life and death were kept. He governed the abode of the Three Hun, overseeing the thirty-two heavens and the constellations in their ranks. All presided over the life-registers of humankind, recording the Three Hun and Seven Po. Evil was inscribed in the Black Ledger of the Right Palace; good was inscribed in the Azure Writ of the Left Palace’s Mysterious Bureau.\n\nAll emperors and kings received their mandate from the stellar correspondences, their positions ruling the Central Heaven. Yet in the Lower Kalpa, the people accumulated sins, filth, and rebellious iniquity, and upon death, they became lower ghosts, examined by the Three Officials. Their primordial essence and life-mandate, though congealed in the upper qi, could not save them. Their corpses were claimed by the demonic filth of the Six Caverns, flowing downward through the Three Realms, instilling fear in the living. Dead, they entered the ghostly path, forever losing the true destiny. Unable to augment their spirit or extend their lifespan, they perished beneath the sun and moon—how could this not be lamentable?\n\nThe Dao speaks: Between heaven and earth, all are nurtured under the shelter of the Seven Primordials. When heaven and earth give birth to humans, each possesses Seven Po spirits within the body, corresponding above to the Seven Stars. The Three Hun reside within the five viscera, corresponding above to the Three Terraces of heaven. If a person cultivates through breath refinement, ingesting essence and absorbing qi, upholding the scriptures and precepts, entering the chamber to refine the essence, contemplating the spirit and invoking the Perfected, and conserving qi by speaking little, then the Seven Po true spirits will guard them. Above, they correspond to heaven; in the middle, they correspond to the Seven Primordial Palaces. All ascend to the Three Officials, Nine Bureaus, and Three Thousand Six Hundred Offices of the Upper Primordial, their names recorded among the essence of the Celestial Primordial. Thus, the learning of the living is accomplished, and spirits descend into the numinous palace.\n\nThe Three Hun spirits in heaven become officials of the Three Terraces, all appointed as celestial bureaus, presiding over matters of life, death, and urgent calamities. If one cultivates the Seven Primordials, the Three Celestial Bureaus will record their goodness, and the Three Officials of the lower ghosts will be unable to seize their register.\n\nThe Seven Perfected say: The people of the Lower Kalpa accumulate much iniquity and cannot augment their spirit or extend their lifespan. They are bound by yin ghosts and evil demons, fettered by the wind-blade, unaware of the Great Dao. The true qi of the Seven Primordials can rescue and deliver a few, achieving merit in the war against ghosts. The Celestial Bureaus possess the tally for reversal and exchange; the Lord Emperor of the Northern Culmen has the method for expulsion—this can prolong life. Let later learners cultivate this, and they may attain longevity, extending their lifespan and enhancing their mandate.\n\nThe people of the Lower Kalpa are all bound by corpse-demons and cannot receive the power of the upper offices, thus meeting early death. Buried corpses and interred bones make it difficult for their hun and po to reach the Mysterious Capital, becoming the people of the ruined corpse, lost and unenlightened.\n\nThe Great Emperor addressed the Seven Perfected: \"In the past, I received the command of the Heavenly Worthy to wage war against the lower ghosts, rescuing the people to spare them from untimely death. Each day brought increase, and the Most High ascended to the North, assuming the position of Supreme Culmen, becoming the Great Emperor of Northern Fengdu. I govern all registers and charts with thirty-six articles of statutes and methods, all aligned with the correct stellar correspondences. There are the Six Celestial Talismans of the Six Paths, sealing the demonic palaces of the Six Caverns. There are also the Seven Primordial Treasure Registers, containing the Three Celestial Mysterious Charts, which depict the positions of the Twenty-Eight Constellations and the sun and moon. There is the Treasure-Mirror Numinous Scripture, with forty-eight characters, all arrayed as the qi of primordial essence, congealed into radiance. Each character is eight inches long, carved within the phoenix tube. The Seven Perfected may all, after three audiences at the imperial chariot, be named the *Divine Chapters for Subduing Demons*. Officials, both male and female, may follow the statutes and methods, inscribing them in cinnabar on plain silk to wear, repelling evil and prolonging life.\n\nThe Seven Perfected bowed their heads and prostrated themselves, standing in the high position of ministers, overseeing the celestial people. How should they present the charts and registers to practice and uphold them, thereby expelling demonic filth? Let the Lower Kalpa encounter this profound mystery, kneel to receive the formulaic words, and let the living cultivate and learn, understanding the retribution of good and evil—this is of profound significance.\"\n\nThe Great Emperor addressed the Seven Perfected: \"From this point onward, the people of the Lower Kalpa descend with the chaotic true qi of the Primordial One, born of primordial essence, receiving form as one. All are nurtured by the Three Primordials, covered by the Nine Qi, becoming the multitudes. All are born from the interchange of the One Primordial; their lifespans have their own measures, their rise and decline governed by cyclical destiny. All may cultivate the methods of extending life. Wear the talismanic registers, offer my life-wealth, focus your essence and discipline your mechanism, and do not incur karmic obstacles. Follow the One Primordial to deliver and rescue, dispelling misfortune.\n\nEach Primordial has thirty-six palaces, each palace has one hundred twenty bureaus, governing the statutes and decrees of life, death, sin, and fortune. When people make offerings and present money and silk, they follow the Primordial to their destination. The living obtain blessings, misfortunes vanish, illnesses heal—there is nothing that does not respond with auspiciousness. The primordial essence and pure qi descend to cover the human body, nurturing it as primordial essence. The Three Hun guard the body, the Seven Po support the form, and the myriad evils dare not harm it.\"\n\nThe Seven Perfected received the mandate, overseeing the various offices that examine the statutes of sin and fortune, each with its own bureau, linked to the life-registers of the people. Life and death, fortune and misfortune—all are determined by my primordial essence. Those who preserve their form and secure their root are called \"guardians of essence.\" The people who descend with the Perfected, I shall constantly nurture. Let them prosper, observe the fasts, and uphold the Dao. They may wear my secret formulaic writ, ingest the essence of the sun and the bloom of the moon, and pay homage to the Perfected Officials of the Twenty-Eight Constellations. Thus, they may extend their years, pass through calamities, wander famous mountains, and become true masters of the age. The myriad spirits bow their heads, and the enlightened demons attend the imperial chariot, attaining the Dao and realizing perfection.\"\n\nThus they become companions of ascending immortals, recorded in the registers and writs. For those scholars of this scripture’s middle and later teachings who devote themselves to its cultivation, governing the world and ordering the people, let them not transgress the celestial statutes. Their practice shall attain spiritual progress. This celestial writ, wondrous and profound, is transmitted to later generations. The divine contract and numinous text are arrayed as follows:\n\nThe Supreme Perfection declares: The true qi of the Seven Primes, the divine chapters of the Purple Palace, the Phoenix Register’s covenant—forty-eight characters inscribed and concealed within the famous mountains. Once bestowed by the Purple Youth Lord, this is not for the worldly paths of later learners or false masters. Guard it well, for the celestial statutes are stern. Let this be clearly proclaimed to all celestial and mortal beings who know it.\n\nHere ends the *Secret Scripture of the Seven Primes’ True Oral Formula for Driving Away Pestilence*.",
