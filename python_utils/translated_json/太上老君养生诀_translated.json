The Five Animal Frolics**\n\nThe Supreme Lord Lao said: The immortals of old practiced *daoyin*, stretching and pulling the body, moving all the joints to seek agelessness. This was called the \"Five Animal Frolics.\" Stretching the limbs and hooves served as *daoyin*. When discomfort arose in the body, one would perform the frolics of a single animal until sweat appeared, then cease. The body would feel light and at ease. Practicing this widely, one could live over nine hundred years, with keen hearing and sight, and teeth intact and firm.\n\nYet while the method is simple, few practice it—how lamentable!\n\n- **Tiger Frolic:** Crouch on all fours, advance three steps, retreat three steps, stretch the body, now forward, now backward. Lift the head to the sky, then return to crouching. Advance and retreat on all fours, seven times each.\n- **Bear Frolic:** Lie flat on the back, clasp the knees with both hands, raise the head, and tilt left to touch the ground seven times, then right seven times. Rock on the ground, pushing left and right with the hands, seven times each.\n- **Deer Frolic:** Crouch on all fours, stretch the neck and look back, left three times, right three times. Extend the left leg while bending the right, then the right leg while bending the left. Stretch and contract alternately, three times each.\n- **Ape Frolic:** Grasp an object and hang suspended, stretching and contracting the body up and down seven times. Clasp the object with the feet and hang upside down, left seven times, right seven times. Sit, grasp the left foot with the right hand, press five times, seven times each.\n- **Bird Frolic:** Stand, lift one foot, stretch both arms, flap vigorously, fourteen times each. Sit, extend the legs, pull the toes seven times each, stretch and contract the arms seven times each.\n\nThe Five Animal Frolics may be practiced according to one’s strength, stopping when sweat appears. They lighten the body, aid digestion, replenish *qi* and strength, and dispel all illnesses. Hua Tuo practiced them and lived beyond ten thousand years. His disciple, Wu Pu of Guangling, also attained longevity through their transmission.\n\n**2. Six Qi for Inhalation and Exhalation**\n\n- **Yan (咽):** *Yan* governs the lungs. The lungs connect to the five viscera. When afflicted by wind, the nose becomes blocked. Treat with *yan* exhalation and inhalation.\n- **He (呵):** *He* governs the heart. The heart connects to the tongue. When the five viscera overheat, the tongue dries. Treat with *he* exhalation and inhalation.\n- **Hu (呼):** *Hu* governs the spleen. The spleen connects to the lips. As the saying goes: \"When the spleen is warm, the lips scorch.\" Treat with *hu* exhalation and inhalation.\n- **Xu (嘘):** *Xu* governs the liver. The liver connects to the eyes. As the saying goes: \"When the liver is excessive, the eyes redden.\" Treat with *xu* exhalation and inhalation.\n- **Chui (吹):** *Chui* governs the kidneys. The kidneys connect to the ears. As the saying goes: \"When the kidneys are deficient, the ears deafen.\" Treat with *chui* exhalation and inhalation.\n- **Xi (嘻):** *Xi* governs the Triple Burner. Treat with *xi* exhalation and inhalation when afflicted.\n\n**3. The True Formula for Nurturing Life**\n\nThe superior practitioner cultivates it to preserve the True and extend life...\n\nThe middling practitioner cultivates it to avoid all disasters and misfortunes;\nThe lesser practitioner cultivates it to escape bodily harm and untimely death;\nThe foolish scorn it and perish prematurely.\n\nLord Lao said: A person’s body is like the image of a kingdom.\nThe chest and abdomen are as palaces;\nThe limbs’ positions are as the suburbs and borders;\nThe divisions of the joints are as the hundred officials;\nThe spaces between the skin and flesh are as the four thoroughfares.\nThe spirit is as the ruler, blood as the ministers, qi as the people.\nHe who can govern his body is like a wise lord who governs his state.\nLoving one’s people ensures the state’s peace;\nLoving one’s qi ensures the body’s wholeness.\nWhen the people are exhausted, the state perishes;\nWhen qi is depleted, the body decays.\n\nThus the perfected and superior practitioners administer medicine before illness arises, not chase after it once ruin has set in.\nKnow that life is hard to preserve yet easy to lose,\nQi is hard to purify yet easy to pollute.\nIf one can discern the subtle workings of opportunity, one may secure the altars of the state;\nIf one can restrain desires, one may safeguard life and destiny.\n\nNow, those who excel in nurturing life must first eliminate the six harms before they can preserve life and prolong their years to a hundred.\nWhat are these six?\nFirst, diminish fame and profit;\nSecond, forbid indulgence in sound and beauty;\nThird, moderate wealth and possessions;\nFourth, relinquish rich flavors;\nFifth, eradicate deceit and falsehood;\nSixth, abandon envy and jealousy.\nRemove these six, and the Dao of cultivating life will succeed without fail.\nIf these six are not eliminated, no benefit will be seen—\nEven if one’s heart yearns for subtle principles, mouth recites true scriptures, savors their essence, and practices breathwork with celestial images, it cannot compensate for life’s brevity.\nTo abandon the root and vainly seek the branches is deeply lamentable!\n\nTo preserve one’s true nature, one must:\nThink little, contemplate little,\nLaugh little, speak little,\nRejoice little, anger little,\nDelight little, sorrow little,\nDesire little, detest little,\nEngage in few affairs, entertain few schemes.\n\nFor excessive thought injures the spirit,\nExcessive contemplation wearies the heart,\nExcessive laughter overturns the organs,\nExcessive speech depletes the Sea of Qi,\nExcessive joy invites guest wind into the bladder,\nExcessive anger causes the interstices to surge,\nExcessive delight leads the heart-spirit astray,\nExcessive sorrow withers hair and beard,\nExcessive desire topples will and qi,\nExcessive detestation scatters essence and clarity,\nExcessive affairs dry and strain the sinews,\nExcessive scheming plunges wisdom into confusion.\nThese erode life more severely than axes,\nDevour one’s nature more fiercely than wolves.\n\nAvoid prolonged sitting or walking, prolonged seeing or hearing.\nDo not force eating—eating when not hungry wearies the spleen;\nDo not force drinking—drinking when not thirsty distends the stomach.\nThe body should be regularly active, food taken to half-satiety;\nDo not over-exert, do not exceed half-fullness.\nIn winter, do not leave the stomach empty at dawn or dusk;\nIn summer, do not eat to fullness at night.\nRise early, but not before the cock’s crow;\nRise late, but not after sunrise.\n\nWhen the mind is serene, the true spirit guards its place;\nWhen qi is settled, pathogenic influences depart the body.\nDeceitful conduct saddens the spirit;\nContentious behavior dispirits it.\nTo slight others invites misfortune;\nTo harm creatures ensures premature death.\nPerforming one good deed gladdens the hun-soul;\nCommitting one evil delights the po-soul.\nAbide in magnanimity and tranquility,\nAnd body and spirit will be at peace.\nThe Register of Life will inscribe one’s name,\nThe Ledger of Death will erase one’s faults.\nThe principles of nurturing life are all contained herein!\n\n**Formula for Qi Absorption**\nLord Lao said: The Gate of the Mysterious Female is the root of Heaven and Earth.\nSubtle and unceasing, it exists as if present, yet its use is inexhaustible.\nThis refers to the mouth and nose as the gates of Heaven and Earth,\nThrough which one exhales and inhales the qi of yin and yang, life and death.\n\nEach morning, face south, extend both hands upon the knees,\nGently press and knead the joints,\nExhale turbid qi from the mouth, inhale pure qi through the nose—\nThis is what is meant by \"expelling the old and absorbing the new.\"\nAfter holding the breath for a long while, exhale slowly.\nThen, with the hands, stretch upward, downward, left, and right.\nWhen drawing in qi, visualize the Great Harmony’s primordial qi descending into the hairline,\nFlowing into the five viscera, and moistening the four limbs,\nLike mountains receiving clouds, like the earth receiving moisture.\nWhen qi flows freely, one feels a gurgling movement in the abdomen.\nAfter ten cycles, the body feels supple and radiant,\nThe complexion lustrous,\nThe ears and eyes keen,\nFood tastes better,\nStrength doubles,\nAnd all illnesses depart.\n\nAnother method: Perform this between midnight and noon, when qi is alive;\nAt other times, when qi is dead, do not regulate or absorb it.\nAfter regulating qi, prepare a thick, soft mat,\nPillow height matching the body,\nLie flat on the back, legs extended,\nFists clenched four to five inches from the body,\nFeet also four to five inches apart.\nGently inhale the solar qi through the nose,\nDirect it with the mind to permeate the entire body,\nThen hold the breath to its limit,\nAnd exhale slowly through the mouth,\nTaking care that no sound is heard.\nFor afflictions such as cold-heat, miasmic diseases, or swollen feet,\nPractice this regardless of the hour.\nIf not cured the same day, repeat the next;\nWithin two or three days, recovery is certain.\n\nFor cold pain in the heart, exhale with *hu*;\nFor heat, exhale with *chui*;\nFor foot pain, exhale with *xu*;\nFor lung pain, exhale with *si*.\n\nAfter midnight, perform twenty-four cycles;\nAt cock’s crow, eighteen;\nAt dawn, twelve;\nAt sunrise, twelve—\nThe more cycles, the better.\nBefore practicing this method, first perform the Eighteen Postures of Dao Yin\nAnd the Twenty-Four Massages.\nPeople rely on Dao Yin to dispel the five viscera’s diseases.\n\nFor heart disease, the body feels cold and hot.\nIn physiognomy, the heart’s color is red;\nIn dreams, one sees people in red garments wielding knives, staves, or fire to frighten.\nThe remedy: Use *hu* and *chui* exhalations to dispel it—\n*Hu* dispels cold, *chui* dispels heat.\n\nFor lung disease, the chest and back feel distended and full,\nThe four limbs restless and oppressed.\n\nIn physiognomy, the lung’s color is white;\nIn dreams, one sees people in white garments—men and women embracing intimately,\nOr women holding one another,\nOr appearing as one’s parents, siblings, or spouse.\nThe remedy: Use *he* exhalation to dispel it.\n\nFor liver disease, one feels sorrowful and joyless,\nWith pain in the head and eyes.\nIn physiognomy, the liver’s color is green;\nIn dreams, one sees people in green garments wielding green knives or staves,\nOr lions, tigers, or wolves to frighten.\nThe remedy: Use *xu* exhalation to dispel it.\n\nFor spleen disease, wandering wind afflicts the body,\nCausing restless oppression and pain.\nIn physiognomy, the spleen’s color is yellow;\nIn dreams, one sees yellow objects,\nOr children striking one’s flanks,\nOr whirlwinds swirling around.\nThe remedy: Use *xi* exhalation to dispel it.\n\nFor kidney disease, the body feels cold and the *yin* declines.\nIn physiognomy, the kidney’s color is black;\nIn dreams, one sees people in black garments wielding knives or staves to frighten.\nThe remedy: Use *si* exhalation to dispel it.\n\nPerform each method thirty-six times.\nIf practice does not yield a cure, supplement with left and right Dao Yin and massage.\n\nIt is said: The body is the master of the spirit;\nQi is the life of the spirit.\nThus, body and spirit depend on qi to endure.\nTherefore, regulate and harmonize the four limbs,\nCirculating through the six bowels.\nIf there is blockage or stagnation, illness arises.\nThus, the human body is formed of emptiness, completed by qi.\nIf breathing is properly regulated, all illnesses naturally dissipate.\nIf exhalation and inhalation deviate from the method, all illnesses arise.\nThose who skillfully nurture life must first know the method of regulating qi.\nThis is what is meant by: \"Breath and life arise together,\nAiming for longevity and joyful delight.\"\nSuch is the teaching!\n\n*The Supreme Lord Lao’s Method of Nurturing Life* concludes.\n\n[#1 Note: The character 而 should be emended to 面 according to the context.]",
