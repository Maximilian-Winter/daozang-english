  "full_translation": "**Imperially Commissioned Complete Library of the Four Treasuries**\n**Section: Masters (Subsection 14) – Abstract**\n\n*Kangcangzi*\n\n**Daoist Category**\n\nWe, your ministers, respectfully note: The *Kangcangzi* in one fascicle is traditionally attributed to Gengsang Chu. Liu Zongyuan of the Tang once expressed doubts about its authorship. Both Chao Gongwu’s *Record of Reading* and Gao Sisun’s *Catalogue of Masters* state that during the Kaiyuan and Tianbao eras of the Tang, Gengsangzi was revered as the *Dongling Zhenjing* (\"True Classic of the Cavernous Numinous\"), but the text itself could not be obtained. Later, Wang Shiyuan, a reclusive scholar from Xiangyang, compiled passages from various masters and presented them as the *Kangcangzi*. Zhou Li, in his *Brush Notes*, excerpted the phrase \"selecting scholars through literary examinations in perilous times,\" as well as the line \"in a single village, a single county, a single prefecture, one dons the purple robes of office,\" asserting that these referred to Tang institutions. Song Lian’s *Discernment of Masters* also noted that the text’s use of \"people\" in place of \"commoners\" and \"generation\" in place of \"era\" was an avoidance of Taizong’s taboo, concluding that the work was composed by a Tang scholar.\n\nUpon examination, the preface to Meng Haoran’s collected works, written by Wang Shiyuan of Xuancheng, states that he \"revised the nine chapters of the *Kangcangzi*.\" Additionally, Wei Tao’s preface from the ninth year of Tianbao (750) also mentions Wang Shiyuan of Xuancheng, praising his \"lucid and profound literary style, his deep understanding of principles, and his frequent sojourns in mountains and waters, far from the world of men,\" while noting that he \"composed several chapters of the *Kangcangzi* to transmit to later generations.\" Thus, this text was in fact supplemented by Shiyuan and was not a forgery. Though later scholars raised doubts, they did so without proper investigation.\n\nHowever, Gengsang Chu, who dwelled in Weilei, is mentioned only in the *Zhuangzi*, while the *Records of the Grand Historian*’s \"Biography of Zhuang Zhou\" states that Zhuangzi’s works, such as the *Weilei* and *Kangcangzi*, were mere empty words devoid of factual basis. Whether such a figure ever existed remains uncertain, much like the nebulous figures of Hongmeng and Yunjiang. The *Han Bibliographies* and *Sui Bibliographies* do not record this text. How, then, could it have emerged in the Tang without any foundation? It is likely that Shiyuan had already composed this work, and the court Daoists—such as Ye Fashan and Luo Gongyuan—further propagated it, creating the conditions for an imperial decree to seek it out. Shiyuan’s own preface mentions that in the fourth year of Tianbao (745), he was summoned to the capital, which coincided with the completion of the text. This serves as clear evidence.\n\nYet Shiyuan was himself a man of letters, and though his work culls phrases from the *Laozi*, *Zhuangzi*, *Liezi*, *Wenzi*, *Book of Lord Shang*, *Lüshi Chunqiu*, Liu Xiang’s *Shuoyuan* and *Xinxu*, he weaves them together with remarkable coherence and reason, setting it apart from other spurious texts. Its frequent use of archaic and obscure characters aligns with the style of Wei Yuan song and Yuan Bao, prompting Chao Gongwu to remark that \"those lacking inner substance often resort to external embellishment,\" which aptly diagnoses its flaw. Such is the habit of literary men fond of novelty, and we shall not dwell on it further.\n\nThe *Chongwen General Catalogue* lists it as nine chapters, while Ma Duanlin’s *Comprehensive Examination of Literature* records it in two fascicles. Song Lian’s *Discernment of Masters* gives it as five fascicles. This edition, however, contains only one fascicle, though its chapter count matches the *Chongwen General Catalogue*, suggesting it may preserve the original form.\n\n---\n\n*Commentary on the Kangcangzi*\n\n**Daoist Category**\n\nWe, your ministers, respectfully note: The commentary on the *Kangcangzi* in nine chapters is traditionally attributed to He Can, though his era is unrecorded. Liu Zongyuan, in his *Reading the Kangcangzi*, observed that neither Liu Xiang nor Ban Gu included the *Kangcangzi* in their bibliographies, yet those who practiced its arts had already begun transmitting and annotating it for the world. Thus, commentaries existed as early as Zongyuan’s time, though he did not specify the commentator’s name. Chao Gongwu’s *Record of Reading* lists the *Kangcangzi* in two fascicles with commentary by He Zan. As Gongwu lived between the Northern and Southern Song, He Zan must have lived before the Northern Song. The character \"Zan\" (瓚) in this edition differs slightly from \"Can\" (粲), likely due to a scribal variant. The commentary is concise and unadorned, lacking the florid language of the Song and later periods, suggesting it may be the same commentary Zongyuan encountered.\n\nThe text also includes phonetic glosses, which were added by Huang Jian of the Ming. At the end of the volume is a postscript by Jian, who was skilled in archaic characters. His work, *Following Antiquity to Rectify Texts*, is replete with eccentric and impractical forms. The *Kangcangzi*’s frequent use of obscure characters aligned with Jian’s scholarly pursuits, so he gladly provided phonetic annotations. However, these glosses are interspersed with the commentary, making it impossible to distinguish them—a pernicious habit of Ming scholars who tampered with ancient texts.\n\nGao Sisun’s *Catalogue of Masters* erroneously attributes the *Kangcangzi* to Wang Bao, an egregious error. Huang Jian’s postscript also claims it was written by Wang Bao, failing to correct the mistake. This is unsurprising, as Jian’s life’s work centered on shocking the world with bizarre characters to gain fame, and he did not delve deeply into other matters.\n\n**Respectfully collated and presented in the tenth month of the forty-sixth year of the Qianlong reign.**\n\n**Chief Compilers:**\nYour Ministers Ji Yun, Lu Xixiong, Sun Shiyi\n\n**Chief Collator:**\nYour Minister Lu Feichi\n\n*Imperially Commissioned Complete Library of the Four Treasuries – Kangcangzi*\n\n**The Complete Dao, Chapter One**\n\nKangcangzi dwelled on the slopes of Mount Yu for three years. The customs of the land knew no plague or pestilence, and the grain harvests were ever abundant. The people whispered among themselves: *\"When Kangcangzi first arrived, we thought him strange. Yet now, though we reckon our days and find them wanting, when we count the year, we find it full. Could he be a sage? Why not honor him as we honor the spirits of the soil and grain?\"*\n\nKangcangzi, hearing this, wore an expression of disquiet. His disciple Yanche followed and asked him about it. Kangcangzi said: *\"I have heard that the perfected person dwells in a humble abode, yet the people run wild, heedless of where they go. Now, in this land of Yu, fathers and sons whisper in secret—do they take me for one who seeks sacrificial vessels and offerings? This is why I cannot dismiss the words of Lao Dan.\"*\n\nYanche said: *\"Not so. In shallow pools, great fish have no room to turn, and so the minnows and eels rule them. On low hills, mighty beasts have no place to hide, and so the foxes and wildcats claim them as omens. Moreover, honoring the worthy, serving the capable, inclining toward goodness, and pursuing profit—this has been the way since Yao and Shun. How much more should it be so for the people of Yu? Master, heed them.\"*\n\nKangcangzi said: *\"Alas! Come, you two—do you understand? The beast in the trap leaves the mountain and is ensnared by nets and snares; the fish that swallows boats strays from the water and is tormented by ants and mole-crickets. Thus birds and beasts dwell where they may soar high, fish and turtles where they may plunge deep. For those who preserve their form and life, to conceal themselves is only to seek depth and obscurity—nothing more. Let me tell you: is this not the root of great disorder? Will it endure even between Yao and Shun? A thousand generations hence, there will surely be men who devour one another.\"*\n\nBefore he had finished speaking, Nanzi Rongzhu’s expression shifted abruptly, and he rose from his mat, saying: *\"I, Rongzhu, have long lived by the turning of the years—how shall I entrust my work to these words?\"*\n\nKangcangzi said: *\"Preserve your form, embrace your life, and let not your thoughts and cares flutter about like this. Then, perhaps, you may live to see such times. Though this be so, my talent is meager and insufficient to transform you. Why not journey south to seek my teacher, Dan?\"*\n\nKangcangzi then declined Rongzhu’s request, unwilling to abandon the customs of Yu and depart like a dragon. The nature of water in the world is to be clear, yet earth muddies it, so it cannot remain clear. The nature of man is to be long-lived, yet things muddy it, so it cannot endure. This is why one nurtures the nature. Now, the deluded of this age often use their nature to nurture things, unaware of what is light and what is heavy. Thus, the sage in regard to sounds, colors, and flavors—if they benefit the nature, he takes them; if they harm the nature, he discards them. This is the Dao of preserving the nature.\n\nWhen ten thousand men draw their bows to shoot at a single target, the target cannot but be struck. When the myriad things shine forth to harm a single life, that life cannot but be injured. Thus, the sage in ordering the myriad things preserves their Heaven. When Heaven is preserved, the spirit is preserved.\"\n\nThe person of complete spirit acts without deliberation yet penetrates all, plans without scheming yet hits the mark, with illumination that leaves nothing outside and a will concentrated as the cosmos—his virtue is like that of Heaven and Earth. Whether above as Son of Heaven or below as a common man, he remains neither arrogant nor dejected. This is called the person of complete Dao.\n\nWith a heart level and upright, unenticed by external things, one is called pure; purity that endures becomes clarity; clarity that endures becomes emptiness; emptiness is where the Dao abides in full. When Qin Yi died, Kang Cangzi wept for him. His servant said, \"Everyone in the world dies—why do you weep for this man alone?\" Kang Cangzi replied, \"Everyone in the world weeps—how could I not weep? The servant said, \"Weeping must come from sorrow, yet you show no sorrow—why is this?\" Kang Cangzi said, \"In all beneath Heaven, I have no one to share joy—where would I find sorrow? The shedding of earth is called water; the shedding of water is called qi; the shedding of qi is called emptiness; the shedding of emptiness is called the Dao. Emptiness is the body of the Dao; stillness is the ground of the Dao; principle is the warp of the Dao; knowledge is the eye of the Dao. The Dao preserves the spirit; virtue expands one’s capacity; ritual orders conduct; things nourish the body.\n\nThose who favor white things deem black defiled; those who favor black things deem white defiled. How then can I know what in the world is truly pure or defiled? Thus, I do not judge things by their purity or defilement. The dim-sighted take yellow as red and green as black—what I call black and white, how can the discerning not see as crimson and yellow? How then can I know what in the world is the true color? Thus, I do not flee from the colors of things.\n\nThose who covet wealth excessively see nothing else worth coveting; those who love horses excessively see nothing else worth loving; those who love books excessively see nothing else worth loving. How then can I know what in the world is truly lovable or truly detestable? Thus, I do not perceive things as worthy of attachment. Without such abilities to disturb my true nature, I remain untainted.\"\n\nThe Lord of Chen Huai dispatched his minister to perform a ceremonial visit to Lu, where Viscount Shusun privately inquired, \"Does your state have a sage? Do you know of him?\" The minister of Chen replied, \"How can one clearly demonstrate his sageliness?\" Viscount Shusun said, \"He can discard the mind and employ the form.\" The minister of Chen said, \"Though our humble state is small, it too has a sage, one unlike what you have heard. May I ask whom you refer to as a sage?\" The minister of Chen replied, \"There is one called Kang Cangzi, who has fully attained the Dao of Lao Dan. He can use his ears to see and his eyes to hear.\"\n\nDuke Ding of Lu, having heard this, found it extraordinary. He sent the Viscount Shusun to return the visit and extend an invitation to Kang Cangzi, receiving him with the rites due to a senior minister. When Kang Cangzi arrived, he was lodged in the secondary guest quarters. The Duke of Lu, speaking with humble words, questioned him. Kang Cangzi said, \"I can see and hear without using my ears and eyes. It is not that the ears and eyes have exchanged their functions; rather, what they convey is excessive.\"\n\nThe Duke said, \"How can this be? I am increasingly astonished. What is the nature of your Way? I truly wish to hear it.\" Kang Cangzi said, \"My body harmonizes with my mind, my mind with my qi, my qi with my spirit, and my spirit with the formless. There is the sound of resolute presence and the resonance of serene emptiness. Though distant, reaching beyond the eight wilds, or near, within the space between the brows, whatever comes to me, I know it completely. Yet I do not know whether it is my seven apertures, limbs, six viscera, five organs, or the thoughts of my heart that perceive it—it is simply self-awareness.\"\n\n**Using the Dao, Second Chapter**\n\nHeaven cannot be trusted, earth cannot be trusted, people cannot be trusted, the heart cannot be trusted—only the Dao can be trusted. How could worthy rulers and outstanding scholars know this?\n\nIn ancient times, Jie trusted heaven and relied on his dominion over the four seas, yet he did not diligently follow the Dao. Heaven took his state and bestowed it upon Yin. Zhou likewise trusted heaven and relied on his dominion over the four seas, yet he did not reverently follow the Dao. Heaven took his state and bestowed it upon Zhou.\n\nNow, the indolent farmer trusts the earth to truly produce the hundred grains, yet he does not exert himself in the Way of cultivation. The earth steals his harvest and leaves it overgrown and barren. The late Qi ruler trusted human nature, believing in yielding and deference, yet he was not enlightened in the Way. He handed over his entire realm to others, who, like owls and jackals, seized his state.\n\nOrdinary people do not cultivate the Dao but follow their hearts as teachers, pursuing desires that flourish and multiply. Disasters, illnesses, conflicts, and injuries befall them, harming their bodies and shortening their lives—all because the heart is the source of harm.\n\nThus, it is said: Only the Dao can be trusted. Heaven and earth cannot endure without the Dao. The common people cannot be pacified without the worthy. The myriad affairs cannot be harmonized without talent.\n\nThose who employ the Dao do not reveal their use. Blessings nurture the ten thousand things, and merit returns to the formless. Their spirit merges, their undertakings flourish, their auspiciousness is enduring, and their wisdom is discerning. To know and distinguish is called knowledge; to know and not distinguish is called the Dao. Knowledge is for governing others; the Dao is for pacifying others.\n\nThe rooster crows at dawn, and the laborer bears the sun’s burden, toiling until sweat soaks the earth. At midnight, he barely rests—this is the Way of the farmer. Bending down to gather, reaching up to take, sharpening his wits, straining his thoughts, striving for profit—this is the Way of the merchant. Swallowing qi, nurturing the spirit, restraining thoughts, reducing concerns, transcending the mundane, refining the essence, and ascending as an immortal—this is the Way of the lofty scholar. Cutting off emotions, focusing the mind, dedicating oneself to duty, forgetting sleep to devise plans, and striving for office to serve others—this is the Way of the minister. Purifying the mind, reducing desires, examining close associates, seeking the worthy and good to pacify the myriad people—this is the Way of the ruler.\n\nIf each follows their proper path, aligning with their aspirations and not neglecting their duties, their undertakings will flourish. This is called \"the world possessing the Dao.\" Guiding the sinews and bones preserves the body; shearing desires preserves the spirit; quieting speech preserves fortune. To preserve all three is called \"pure worthiness.\" When virtue is aligned, ghosts and spirits assist; when trust and righteousness are sincere, the noble are drawn near; when ritual and propriety are complete, the petty people submit.\n\nThe discerning consider themselves correct, and the ignorant also consider themselves correct. Those with the Dao are tranquil and silent, and the dull-witted are also tranquil and silent. Things inherently have what seems right but is wrong, and what seems wrong but is right. Some first wail and later laugh; some begin auspiciously and end in misfortune. Some bodies may be close, but their talents cannot be; some talents may be respected, but their bodies are unworthy. Excessive respect leads to distance; excessive closeness leads to disrespect. Being too close creates estrangement; being estranged fosters closeness. Excessive kindness breeds resentment; excessive love breeds hatred. Some value speed, some value slowness; some value straightness, some value crookedness. The appropriateness of all things is subtle and must be understood.\n\nThus, the wise find it difficult: in stillness, their spirit is penetrating; in poverty, their intent is penetrating; in nobility, their words are penetrating; in wealth, their bodies are penetrating—such is the principle of circumstance.\n\nThose who share the Dao love one another; those who share skills envy one another. Those who give together love one another; those who take together envy one another. Those who share suffering love one another; those who share strength envy one another—such is the natural human sentiment.\n\nTo be talented yet humble, poor and lowly yet not obsequious, to endure toil without feeling humiliated, to be rich and noble yet respectful and diligent—this is called possessing virtue.\n\n**Governing the Dao, Third Chapter**\n\nPeople have no method to know heaven; they know heaven through the movements of the four seasons, cold and heat, the sun, moon, and stars. If the movements of the four seasons, cold and heat, the sun, moon, and stars are proper, then all living beings with blood and qi will find their place and rest in their production.\n\nMinisters likewise have no method to know their ruler; they know the ruler through the ruler’s bestowal of rewards, punishments, ranks, and emoluments. If the ruler’s bestowal of rewards, punishments, ranks, and emoluments is fitting, then the close and distant, the worthy and unworthy will all exhaust their talents and be employed.\n\nWhen trust is complete, the world is at peace; when trust is lost, the world is in peril. If the people toil exhaustively and their resources are depleted, their hearts will generate strife and harm, and they will no longer trust.\n\nPeople do not trust because governance is uneven. The unevenness of governance is the fault of the officials. The fault of the officials lies in the inconsistency of punishments and rewards. The inconsistency of punishments and rewards stems from the ruler’s lack of diligence and clarity.\n\nIf the ruler is diligent and clear, punishments and rewards will be unified. If punishments and rewards are unified, officials will uphold the law. If officials uphold the law, governance will be disseminated below. If governance is disseminated below, each person will attain their proper place, and mutual trust will be established.\n\nThus, it is known that the world’s lack of trust arises from the ruler’s lack of diligence and clarity.\n\nKang Cangzi resided in Xirang for five years. King Ling of Chu sent the Duke of Zhai with gifts of silk and fine jade, saying, \"I, an unworthy youth, have been remiss in virtue and occupy this position. Now, floods and droughts come unseasonably. As a ruler of men, how can I avert them?\"\n\nKang Cangzi said, \"Floods are the disorder of yin. Yin prevails in state governance when punishments are excessive and human affairs are dominated by selfishness. Drought is the excess of yang. Yang prevails in state governance when virtue is lacking and human affairs are marked by arrogance. The state of Chu has repeatedly suffered floods and droughts. The Son of Heaven should rectify punishments and cultivate virtue; the hundred officials should eliminate selfishness and guard against arrogance. Thus, disasters will be averted, and a hundred blessings will arrive daily.\"\n\nIn Zheng, there was the Hu jade tablet and the Rong bow, which were lost together to Jing. Jing said, \"You must return the jade tablet and Rong bow; otherwise, we will bring our army against you.\" The ruler of Zheng was troubled and went to see Kang Cangzi, saying, \"The jade tablet and Rong bow were inherited from our former rulers, who obtained them from Hu. For generations, they have been treasured heirlooms, symbols of our lineage’s glory. Now, Jing relies on its size and demands them. If we do not comply, they will bring their army—our state is in peril!\"\n\n\"I wish to send other jade tablets and bows in their place—what should I do?\"\nKang Cangzi replied, \"Your Lordship should remain calm for now. Even Chu possesses treasures here. Adorn Chu’s treasures and offer them to atone for your offense—something Chu cannot do. You must present the genuine articles. Now, Jing, on account of a trifling grievance, wields its might and punishment, flaunting its power without justice, draining and plundering its allies. Jing will lose the allegiance of the feudal lords. When the lords hear of this, they will take heed, be admonished, prepare diligently, and strive for clarity. At the next assembly, righteousness will prevail, and Zheng shall stand foremost. Your Lordship, bide your time—could this not be a blessing?\"\n\nThus, he sent the Hu jade tablet and Rong bow. Before they reached Ying, the people of Jing heard of it and said, \"They heed the counsel of a sage and refuse our demands. How can we seize these by force and expose our injustice to the world, thereby sowing discontent among the feudal lords?\" They promptly returned the gifts and treated Zheng with even greater kindness.\n\nHuman nature desires life and abhors death, seeks security and shuns peril, craves honor and detests disgrace. When the people attain their desires, they rejoice; when they rejoice, they are at peace. When they do not attain their desires, they suffer; when they suffer, they are in danger. If a ruler indulges his desires, the hundred officials and myriad elders will all pursue theirs. When the hundred officials and myriad elders pursue their desires, the people of the world—whether poor or rich—will exhaust their strength or deplete their wealth. The four classes will lose their proper order, and none will attain their desires.\n\nWhen the people of the world do not attain their desires, they will join hands, cling together, flee, hide, drift, or forage to preserve their lives. If officials then pursue and capture them, their peril and suffering will become unbearable, giving rise to thoughts of rebellion. Thus, the state will no longer be their state.\n\nDo not covet a large population—your people will scatter, and the strong will flee. Do not exhaust your people—your cities and ramparts will be manned by the weary. If taxes are excessive, the impoverished will grow poorer daily. If punishments are inconsistent, the destitute will grow more destitute daily. If laws and prohibitions are not enforced, the state will collapse. If officials are unfit, leniency and severity will be misapplied. If you compete with the people for profit, deceitful hearts will arise. Thus, the people will grow cunning and hard to fathom, and the realm will become inscrutable. When the ruler is suspicious, the people grow more confused. When the people are confused, officials toil in vain. When officials toil in vain, rewards fail to encourage, and punishments fail to deter. The state will be easily stirred and hard to pacify—all because officials are not the right people.\n\nThe essence of governance lies in carefully selecting men of talent. Those whose talent and conduct excel in a village should be entrusted with its affairs. Those who excel in a county should be entrusted with its affairs. Those who excel in a province should be entrusted with its affairs. Those who excel in the state should be entrusted with its governance. Only then can hidden talents be fully employed.\n\nIf a man’s wickedness disrupts his village, admonish him. If he does not reform, he is wicked in his county—flog him. If he still does not reform, he is wicked in the state—execute him. Only then can rebelliousness be eradicated. If this is done, every person in the world will stand in awe and reverence, with no trace of defiance, flattery, or insolence. This is called \"pacifying the people.\"\n\nOf all the affairs of the world, none is greater than seeking men of talent. The best way to await their discovery is through sound governance. The best way to achieve sound governance is by pacifying the people. The talent for pacifying the people may be assessed thus: by literary composition, scarcely four or five in a hundred qualify; by eloquence, perhaps one or two in ten; but by their demeanor in handling the sacred regalia of state, eight or nine in ten are fully capable. Such is the discernment of sagacious kings in prosperous times, their ability to select and employ men.\n\nIf, in a declining reign or perilous age, men are chosen by literary composition, cunning and ostentation will flourish, while true refinement and simplicity will recede. If chosen by eloquence, glibness and embellishment will abound, while forthrightness and integrity will fade. If chosen by demeanor in handling the sacred regalia, outward propriety will mask inner deceit, while genuine purity and substance will remain hidden. In such cases, the more worthy men are sought, the more governance will stray; the more decrees are issued, the more the people will be thrown into chaos.\n\nThe realm is the greatest of all vessels; the throne of the Son of Heaven is the weightiest of all positions.\n\nTo secure men of talent is to bring order; to lose them is to invite chaos. Thus, the ruler toils in seeking the worthy and finds ease in employing them. Alas! He who guards the state and gathers its people—how can he neglect to test and examine his officers?\n\nWhen human nature is led astray, it is the sovereign’s deepest concern. Of all such deviations, none is more grievous than the miscarriage of justice. The wise and discerning, when adjudicating disputes, may be lured by deceit, coerced by power, swayed by emotion, or hardened by punishment. Though their methods differ, they must ever uphold impartiality, so that the people of the realm live without cause for gratitude and die without ground for resentment.\n\nHe who governs the state, establishes officials, and administers punishment in this manner may be called the consummate ruler. In such an age of consummate governance, the hearts of the people are harmonious and upright, all livelihoods are fitting, reverence and affection run deep, and the bonds between high and low are firm—unshaken as a single household. If even one household strays from compliance and defies the natural order, how can the realm remain stable?\n\nWhen King Ping returned to the rightful capital and settled in the celestial city, he diligently sought the worthy and the good. Upon hearing even a single word of merit, he would deliberate for days. His attendants and servants repeatedly spoke of ministers who were exceptionally talented. After more than a year of this, the king declared: “I, alone, am lacking in virtue and wisdom. Though I strive to seek the worthy, I fear that those hidden in the mountains and marshes remain overlooked. How could I delight in hearing of goodness only to shut myself off from it?”\n\nYet in the past, flattering courtiers had heaped praise upon the powerful, gradually elevating them through the favor of his attendants. My own weakness and dullness left me unable to discern clearly, so I merely assented or compromised, allowing their self-regard to grow and their virtue to decay—no fault was greater than this. Failing to correct them in time, I let factions take root. Thus, I executed three of my closest attendants in the marketplace and demoted five high-ranking officials, declaring: “Let no minister curry favor with inferiors while deceiving his sovereign, nor cling to office by bending to others’ will.”\n\nWhen the realm heard this, they praised his clarity and wisdom. From the seven states west of the Southern Sea, men flocked to submit. In this age of supreme governance, carriages and robes were plain and unadorned, laws were lenient and simple, and prohibitions were few and broad. When carriages and robes were plain, people did not covet excess; when laws were lenient, customs knew no taboos; when prohibitions were broad, transgressions were easy to avoid yet hard to commit.\n\nIf people do not covet excess, desires wane and they gladly serve in their labors. If customs know no taboos, restraints lift and joyful exchange flourishes. If transgressions are easy to avoid yet hard to commit, good and evil become distinct, and men value virtue and know shame. To gladly serve in labor is called compliance; to engage in joyful exchange is called harmony; to value virtue and know shame is called uprightness. The dissolute cannot prevail against compliance, the rebellious cannot prevail against harmony, and the wicked cannot prevail against uprightness. Compliance, harmony, and uprightness—these are the foundations of governance.\n\nIn declining and decadent ages, carriages and robes grow ornate and cunning, laws become superstitious and convoluted, and prohibitions turn harsh and perverse. When carriages and robes are ornate, admiration for luxury spreads; when laws are superstitious, taboos multiply; when prohibitions are perverse, none know how to escape them. If admiration for luxury spreads, men grow disloyal and shameless, scorning simplicity and prizing ostentation. If taboos multiply, emotions and intentions are stifled, and high and low grow estranged. If none know how to escape prohibitions, defenses multiply and the people no longer fear death.\n\nWhen men scorn simplicity and prize ostentation, this is called \"floating\"; when high and low grow estranged, this is called \"blockage\"; when none fear death, this is called \"recklessness.\" The truly upright do not serve in \"floating\" regimes; the just and forthright do not serve in \"blocked\" ones; the capable and skilled do not serve in \"reckless\" ones. Floating, blockage, and recklessness—these three are the ladders to national chaos.\n\nKing Xiong Yu of Jing asked about floods, droughts, order, and disorder. Kang Cangzi replied: \"Floods and droughts come from Heaven; order and disorder come from man. If human affairs are harmonious and well-governed, even floods and droughts cannot cause harm—such were the cases of Yao and Tang.\" He continued: \"Thus, the Zhou system of official ranks states: 'Man’s strength overcomes Heaven.' If human affairs are corrupted and disordered, even without floods or droughts, the state will daily crumble and collapse. Were Jie and Zhou’s downfalls merely due to floods and droughts?\" The King of Jing faced north, bowed in reverence, and said: \"Heaven has not abandoned this unworthy one to hear such words.\" He then presented ten pairs of fine jade disks to honor Kang Cangzi, bowed again, and appointed him as Vice Minister, saying: \"Perhaps my state may yet recover.\"\n\nKang Cangzi, unable to refuse, spent the night in contemplation, then disguised himself and fled to another region. In a well-governed age, mountains harbor no false recluses, markets yield no illicit profits, courts grant no sycophantic emoluments, and the state’s resources are distributed. How does one obtain such people and pure customs? Kang Cangzi said: \"When governance is oppressive and harsh, people grow cunning and false; when governance is simple and unified, people grow honest and pure. Customs follow the shape of state policy as a looper caterpillar conforms to the leaf. Eat yellow, and the body turns yellow; eat green, and the body turns green.\"\n\n\"How then can the people be enriched?\" Kang Cangzi replied: \"Levy taxes in due season, and if officials are clear and frugal, the people will prosper. If taxes are levied without restraint and officials are extravagant and indulgent, the people will grow poor. The arrowheads of Gou Yue are forged from refined metal, their fletching made from the feathers of fierce falcons. As cudgels, they differ little from rough wood, but when fitted to a powerful crossbow and loosed in battle, they strike down foes three hundred paces away. The *Feijing* sword’s might outshines the sun, its qi surging like purple mist. As a kitchen knife, it differs little from a dull blade, but when wielded against raging bandits and turbulent foes, none within a thousand *li* can stand before it. Thus, materials have their proper divisions, and uses have their proper applications. What matters is skillfully adapting to the times.\n\nIn ancient times, enlightened kings and sagely emperors brought peace to the world, allowing all things to flourish and all natures to reach their full potential. They adapted to the times without meddling. In recent ages, the world teems with the cunning and deceitful, while the upright are few; the frivolous and profit-seeking abound, while the steadfast and retiring are rare. The deceitful out-talk the loyal, leading the world’s people to mutual suspicion and harm. Alas! When establishing laws, ease of avoidance and difficulty of violation should be prized. When remedying abuses, simplicity of affairs and uniformity of commands should be prized. Eliminate the overbearing, and officials will be at ease; enforce punishments and prohibitions strictly, and officials will not dare pursue private gain, enriching the people. The *Shi Xing* states: 'When disasters strike, grant amnesties.' But amnesties should not be frequent, for frequent amnesties allow the wicked to scheme, while the innocent grow resentful, and the worthy and good are obstructed.\n\nWhen men commit great crimes and harm, officials arrest them and expand the investigation, falsely implicating the innocent, dragging in the distant and unrelated, hoping to shift blame and timing—only for the culprits to receive amnesty. Those harmed find no satisfaction, only self-inflicted torment. Thus, the innocent devise ever more cunning schemes, officials toil under harsh governance, and none can quell the chaos. This is the fault of frequent amnesties. Men avoid wickedness and injustice because of punishment, and strive for virtue and righteousness because of reward. Now, the wicked and unjust are pardoned, while the virtuous and righteous are harmed and go unrewarded. Is it not difficult to expect men to pursue goodness?\n\nIn an age with worthy rulers and outstanding scholars, those who examine this discourse will find that the people’s resentment is not due to neglecting them, nor the gods’ anger due to failing to serve them. The more cunning and flattery prevail, the more the people resent; the more excessive sacrifices abound, the more the gods rage.\"\n\n**Chapter Four: The Way of the Ruler**\n\nWhat gives life is Heaven; what nurtures and completes it is man. To nurture what Heaven has given without encroaching upon it is called the Son of Heaven. The Son of Heaven’s actions aim to preserve Heaven’s wholeness—this is how officials establish themselves. Officials are established to preserve life. Yet today’s deluded rulers multiply offices only to harm life, losing the very foundation of officialdom.\n\nWhen grasses are stifled, they rot; when trees are stifled, they become infested; when men are stifled, they fall ill; when states are stifled, a hundred evils arise, and danger and chaos cannot be restrained. A \"stifled state\" means the ruler’s virtue is not disseminated, and the people’s desires are not conveyed upward. Thus, sagely kings value loyal ministers and upright scholars, for they dare to speak frankly and dispel blockages. Restraining oneself and returning to ritual, the worthy will come of their own accord. Plowing the sacred field and performing the *houji* sacrifice, the common people will transform naturally. From this, it is clear: the worthy and upright can be awaited, not sought. Those sought are not truly worthy. The common people can be transformed, not punished. Punishment without principle is not governance.\n\nYao and Shun labored as rulers for the people but had no desires as rulers. Thus, the world each attained their desires. They held the position of ruler but had no ruler’s possessive heart. Thus, the world each gave free rein to their hearts. There are scholars loved by the world whom the ruler does not love, and those loved only by the ruler whom the world does not love. Employing those loved by the world brings peace; employing those loved only by the ruler brings peril. How can a ruler indulge his personal likes and dislikes? Thus, one who values the world must restrain his emotions. The \"world\" refers to its myriad things; a \"state\" refers to its multitudes. The state takes the people as its root; when the people are at peace, the state is at peace. Therefore, a ruler concerned for the state must seek to govern the people’s talents.\n\nJade is hard to distinguish because of strange stones; gold is hard to distinguish because of brass. Now, if a sparrow’s wings are draped over a quail, the dim-sighted will see no difference. But the clear-sighted will see it is a quail. If a petty man recites classics and medical texts, studies arcane arts, or masters persuasive speech, and is clad in blue and purple robes, the foolish will hear and see him as a gentleman. But the discerning will hear and see him as a petty man. Thus, if a ruler is truly enlightened, judging men by their words is proper, by their talents is proper, by their conduct is proper. If a ruler is unenlightened, judging men by their words brings chaos, by their talents brings chaos, by their conduct brings chaos.\n\nThe sage in employing men values the ear.\n\nThe achievements of what is unheard, unseen, and inexpressible allow the people to govern themselves with ease. If a ruler values what is heard, the people of the world will transport goods and chase profit to curry favor. If a ruler values what is seen, the people of the world will flaunt strange forms and arts to vie for advancement. If a ruler values what can be expressed, the people of the world will train their tongues and lips to adorn their words. Should the people of the world curry favor, vie for advancement, and adorn their words to gain access, governance will fail.\n\nAll rulers know that a mirror clarifies their appearance, yet they detest when officials do the same. A mirror clarifies their appearance—its benefit is small. Officials clarify their appearance—its benefit is great. To know the small and lose the great is ignorance indeed.\n\nAlas! If a ruler clears the mind and reduces affairs, and officials are reverent, frugal, and adhere to their duties, great peace will swiftly arrive. Yet some rulers find this difficult—why, I do not know. If the ruler’s heart is unclear and indecisive, then the harmony of heaven and earth, the order within the four seas, and the Dao of all living things will be lost.\n\nThose who select officials by ear and eye have many officials and chaotic governance. Those who select officials by the heart’s deliberation have few officials and clear governance. Thus, in an age of principle, one seeks the unseen and unheard talents. In a perilous age, one seeks the visible and audible talents. Alas! Do rulers understand this?\n\nSelecting officials by ear and eye leads all to flatter and fawn for favor. Selecting officials by the heart’s deliberation leads all to be tranquil and upright, diligent in virtue. When officials are tranquil and upright, diligent in virtue, transformation occurs without words. When officials flatter and fawn for favor, even punishment does not deter them. Do rulers understand this?\n\n**On the Way of Ministers (Chapter Five)**\n\nWhen a state is about to prosper, the hundreds of officials in the court may be short or tall, ugly or beautiful, gentle or stern, right or wrong. Though their words and appearances may seem different, examining their aspirations and testing their hearts reveals all are devoted to the state. Thus, they admonish without resentment, accept demotion without shock, and debate to reach the mean without deviating from principle. Therefore, heaven does not err in its seasons, earth does not lack its benefits, people do not disrupt their affairs, spirits and gods offer aid, and barbarians submit in harmony. All things transform and nurture, and the Great Harmony is preserved.\n\nWhen a state is about to perish, the hundreds of officials in the court have fine appearances, harmonious complexions, elegant and gentle words, and refined movements. Though their appearances and words may seem joyful, examining their aspirations and testing their hearts reveals all are competing for position. Thus, they marvel at the strange, are shocked by the unusual, scheme with jealousy, and ultimately lose the Dao. Therefore, heaven sends disasters, the seasons reverse, earth produces monstrosities, people commit evil deeds, spirits and gods sow misfortune, and barbarians invade repeatedly. Chaos and calamity abound, and all things fail to transform.\n\nThose who do not waste resources, exhaust the people, or harm officials yet achieve success and establish governance, enriching the people and glorifying the ruler’s virtue—such are loyal and worthy ministers. Those who squander wealth, trouble the people, endanger officials, and hastily produce fleeting achievements to seek the ruler’s favor, heedless of future disasters for the state—such are treacherous ministers.\n\nIn an age of perfect governance, officials are well-chosen. In an age of no governance, the unworthy obtain office.\n\nZhulong Wen asked about serving a ruler. Kang Cangzi said: \"One who guards his reputation and serves others must be impartial in heart, harmonious in appearance, and upright in speech. Impartiality should not be exposed, harmony should not be mixed, and uprightness should not offend. The ancients were diligent in governance for the state; today, they are diligent in cultivating reputation for themselves. Those who govern for the state arrange affairs distinctly, act appropriately, and align with the greater whole. Those who cultivate reputation for themselves arrange affairs distinctly but become distant and disconnected, constrained by trivialities.\n\nThus, when the heart takes the Dao as its master, handling affairs finds its proper place. When the heart takes affairs as its master, handling things loses their proper place. Ministers in high positions who do not admonish, and in low positions who are not impartial, fail to fulfill their duties and enjoy their emoluments. The ruler does not show reverence, high ministers are not trusted, and low ministers are not united. In such a court, the talented are not necessarily loyal, and the loyal are not necessarily talented.\n\nMinisters need not worry about disloyalty but fear that their loyalty will not be trusted. They need not worry about distrust but fear that trust will not enable them to serve. The highest type of person, when their nature is realized, brings order to the world. The middling type, when their nature is realized, brings chaos to the world. The enlightened ruler employs the highest type, entrusting them with authority and allowing them to act freely. When employing the middling type, the ruler must set standards, assess their achievements, and apply rewards and punishments.\n\n**On the Way of the Worthy (Chapter Six)**\n\nThe worthy are frequently sought but rarely arrive, difficult to advance yet easy to retreat. It is not that they cherish their lives and refuse to die for the ruler’s affairs, but rather they fear that their loyalty will not be trusted.\n\nThose who know they possess talent and insight are outwardly respectful yet inwardly untroubled. Among the crowd, they are harmonious and upright without being overly familiar. When close, they are even more dignified; when distant, they depart without resentment. In poverty and distress, they accept fate with ease; in honor and success, they rectify themselves with the Dao.\n\nSome may observe their demeanor and deem them worthy, hear their voices and deem them worthy, yet when testing their spirit and assessing their duties, they fall short of expectations. When the worthy are employed, they enter and offer subtle counsel, exit and remain silent, diligently attend to their duties, and live frugally in seclusion. When not employed, they conceal themselves among the crowd, hide their insight from sight, and restrain their words. They eat their fill, walk at ease, cultivate their own virtue, and remain steadfast without resentment. The wise do not doubt their affairs, and the discerning do not doubt their persons.\n\nThose with insight tread perilous paths yet remain unshaken in countenance, speak humbly yet cannot be refuted in principle. The worthy do not call themselves worthy—their effectiveness lies in governance, their achievements in affairs.\n\nIn times of great peace, the highest scholars apply their insight, the middling scholars exhaust their endurance, and the petty exert their strength.\n\nThere was once a man of Qi named Pouzi, whose talents could have revitalized the state, whose conduct could have stood alone. He served his parents with filial piety, was reverent in his village, and adhered to principles. Living in poverty with nothing to support his parents, he practiced trust and righteousness while traveling for a long time. Few understood him, and some, taking advantage of the times, mocked and deceived him. Thus, he carried his staff and walked among the people.\n\nKang Cangzi said: \"I have heard that the perfect person forgets emotions, while the common people do not. Those who preserve emotions strive to teach and revere trust and righteousness. Yet now I do not know: is it better to be untrusted or trusted? To be trusted yet not seen as trustworthy, or to be diligent and admire righteousness? To practice righteousness yet not consider oneself righteous?\n\nThus, the trustworthy and righteous often face hardship and retreat. How can they attain honor? Only when the times favor teaching and principle do they rise.\"\n\nKang Cangzi bowed, adjusted his robe, looked up, and sighed, then sang:\n\n\"When the times are bright, trust and righteousness flourish;\nWhen the times are silent, trust and righteousness hide.\nBright or silent, flourishing or hiding—\nI rush about, yet none claim me.\nAlas! I know not whom to blame.\nTo act with true nature and meet no response—\nIs this not the way of the unrecognized?\"\n\nWhen the true and constant Way no longer prevails, this is called the loss of the Dao. In times of Dao-loss, the superior person retreats into seclusion—seclusion being the proper course when there is something one *can* do, yet nothing one *can* do; when there is something one *can* employ, yet nothing one *can* employ.\n\nDuke Ji asked, \"From where do worthy talents fail to emerge?\"\nKang Cangzi replied, \"Worthiness and uprightness may be awaited, not sought. Talent lies in seeking with care; without care, nothing surpasses the Son of Heaven remaining tranquil, his great ministers illuminating punishments without sparing the noble, bestowing favor without excluding the lowly. Then worthy men will come of themselves, seeking to be employed. When worthy men are employed, within the Four Seas all eyes see clearly, all ears hear purely, and all hearts are at ease without oppression. Heaven accomplishes itself, Earth settles itself, the myriad things mature in harmony, and even ghosts and spirits cannot exert their numinous power. Thus it is said: worthiness and uprightness may be awaited, not sought.\n\nIf the Son of Heaven is diligent and enlightened, and his great ministers harmonious and principled in seeking scholars, then magnanimous, expansive, impartial, and steadfast talents will arrive. If the Son of Heaven is harsh and suspicious, and his great ministers restless and impatient in seeking scholars, then crooked-hearted, cunningly responsive, destructive, and perverse talents will arrive. If the Son of Heaven is doubtful and envious, and his great ministers artfully compliant in seeking scholars, then those with strange surnames, unusual names, sidelong flattery, and bizarre arts will arrive. If the Son of Heaven deems himself worthy, and his great ministers entrench themselves in seeking scholars, then those who chase after ornamentation, pursue reputation, and indulge in greed, impurity, and superficial splendor will arrive. If the Son of Heaven is indecisive, and his great ministers devious and obsequious in seeking scholars, then those who are inwardly loyal yet outwardly perverse, with poisonous dispositions and harmonious words, will arrive. Thus it is said: talent lies in seeking with care; without care, nothing suffices.\n\nIn ancient times, the Yellow Emperor obtained Changxian, Feng Hong, Guirong, and Qiu Shang; King Tang of Shang obtained Yi Yin; King Xuan of Zhou obtained Fu Shen; Duke Huan of Qi obtained Ning Qi—all because these rulers embodied the Dao, surpassed in benevolence, spread illustrious sagacity and martial prowess, pondered harmony and radiance, and were magnanimous, generous, and flourishing in uprightness. Thus, the multitude of worthies came of themselves, seeking to be employed—not obtained through meticulous selection.\n\nDuke Ji said, \"Master, you speak of worthy men not being sought yet arriving of themselves. Are there also those who are unworthy yet arrive of themselves without being sought?\"\nKang Cangzi replied, \"Those who are unworthy yet arrive of themselves without being sought are indeed many. When the world follows the Dao, worthy men arrive of themselves without being sought. When the world loses the Dao, the unworthy arrive of themselves without being sought. Rulers who embody the Dao are few; those who lose it are many. Worthy men in the world are few; the unworthy are many. Thus, those who are unworthy yet arrive of themselves without being sought are many.\"\n\nDuke Ji said, \"The worthy surely save the world, and talents can also save the world. Both save the world—how then do the worthy and the talented differ?\"\nKang Cangzi replied, \"Ah, how pressing is your question! When affairs are accomplished and tasks completed, to not be bound by titles or reputation, to withdraw with reverence, simplicity, and frugality—this is called worthiness. When affairs are accomplished and tasks completed, to take glory in emoluments, reputation, and full satisfaction—this is called talent.\n\nThe worthy can stabilize a state; talents can also govern a state. What is called 'stabilizing' is harmonious peace and non-action—people do not perceive their effort. What is called 'governing' is diligent leadership in affairs—people recognize their virtue. One worthy can lead a multitude of talents with ease; a multitude of talents, even measuring against one worthy, still fall short. Thus, the worthy and the talented dwell in separate realms: some reside in mountains and forests yet are clamorous; some live among the common folk yet are tranquil. Some are clamorous yet upright; some are tranquil yet perverse.\n\nGenerally, when observing their appearance: those whose demeanor is coarse and vulgar yet possess worthiness are one in ten thousand; those whose appearance is refined and elegant yet are petty men are nine in ten. One who does not test their words yet knows their refinement, does not demand their bearing yet examines their measure, does not gather their praise yet knows their goodness, does not follow their slander yet judges their truth—such a one may be called discerning.\"\n\n**Chapter Seven: Instructions on the Dao**\n\nMin Ziqian asked Confucius, \"How do the Dao and filial piety differ?\"\nConfucius replied, \"The Dao is the wondrous function of nature; filial piety is the supreme virtue of human relations. It encompasses and moves Heaven and Earth, engenders and nurtures the myriad things, subtly completes the ten thousand forms, and spreads forth the greatness of inherent nature and longevity. Its achievement is most substantial, yet it does not act as a storehouse for things, does not serve as an office for affairs, and does not claim credit for its accomplishments. Groping for it in seeking, seeing, and hearing, one cannot grasp its possession—thus it is named the Dao. Applied to humanity, it is named filial piety.\n\nFilial piety is the name for serving one’s parents well. In serving one’s parents well, reverence and compliance are fundamental. One’s intent in bearing this compliance is to follow their countenance without fail. Uttering a word or forming an intention, one does not dare forget one’s parents. Moving a hand or placing a foot, one does not dare forget one’s parents. In serving one’s lord, one does not dare be disloyal; with friends, one does not dare be untrustworthy; toward subordinates, one does not dare be disrespectful; in pursuing goodness, one does not dare be idle. Even when dwelling alone in a chamber, one does not dare relax one’s sincerity—this is called perfect filial piety.\n\nThus, utmost sincerity reaches the divine luminaries and shines throughout the Four Seas. There is response to every stimulus—this is the result of serving one’s parents well. In ancient times, Shun the Great was most filial. His stepmother deceived his father, who repeatedly resented and sought to harm him. Yet Shun’s heart grew only more reverent and cautious, without resentment. When they schemed to have him dredge a well, they buried him with earth. At that moment, Heaven’s blessing shook and stirred the divine luminaries, swiftly guiding him out through a side passage. He continued to serve his parents with even greater care. Thereby, his profound virtue flourished, and he became lord of the world—this was the result of serving one’s parents well.\n\nKing Wen, when he was Crown Prince, was most filial...\"\n\nAt dawn and dusk, he would invariably arrive outside the bedchamber doors to inquire of the attendants, \"How is he today? Is he well?\" If they replied, \"He is well,\" the Crown Prince’s face would brighten with joy. If there was even the slightest discomfort, his countenance would fill with worry. When the morning and evening meals were presented, the Crown Prince would first examine their temperature, and only after confirming the dishes offered would he withdraw. When the attendants reported illness, the Crown Prince would don solemn robes and fast. The steward’s prepared meals he would inspect with reverence; the medicinal broths offered he would personally taste. If the food was good, the Crown Prince could eat; if the food was poor, he could not eat his fill—only when his father’s condition returned to normal would his own return to normal.\n\nWhen the lord later erred, he would gently admonish him with harmonious words. Even for the lord’s beloved, no matter how small the matter, he would treat it with utmost gravity. Thus, filial piety perfected his person, and the Dao harmonized the world. As the *Ya* says: *\"King Wen ascends and descends at the Lord’s side,\"* meaning that in King Wen’s stillness and action, advance and retreat, Heaven itself aided him. Thus, Zhou could not harm him, his life was extended in dreams, and the divination for his dynasty foretold thirty reigns and seven hundred years—this was the mandate of Heaven, the result of serving one’s parents well.\n\nMin Ziqian said, \"I have been fortunate to hear the Way of serving parents well. May I ask about the principle of teaching one’s children?\" Confucius replied, \"In all cases, the Three Kings taught their children with ritual and music. Music cultivates the inner self; ritual cultivates the outer. When ritual and music are cultivated together, virtue and bearing shine forth in one’s appearance. Thus, one becomes warmly respectful and civilized. If, as a subject, one would sacrifice one’s life for the ruler’s benefit, how much more should one benefit oneself to serve one’s ruler well? Therefore, they selected loyal, upright, steadfast, and incorruptible scholars as tutors, wishing them to understand the Dao of father and son, ruler and minister, elder and younger. Only after knowing how to be a son can one be a father; only after knowing how to be a minister can one be a ruler; only after knowing how to serve others can one employ others—this is the principle of the Three Kings in teaching their children.\"\n\nMin Ziqian withdrew and practiced this in his own household. For three years, no one could find fault in his words to his parents or brothers, his friends praised his trustworthiness, his village praised his benevolence, and his clan praised his fraternal duty. The reputation of his virtue and conduct spread throughout the world—this, too, was the result of serving one’s parents well.\n\nThe Crown Prince of Qi sat upon the Pure Terrace. Duke Zhuang, wearing a towering cap and stern expression, with a jade-encrusted sword at his left and pendants at his right—his left gleaming upon his right, his right upon his left—read without looking up. The Duke asked, \"Does Qi possess treasures?\" The Crown Prince replied, \"The ruler’s trustworthiness and the ministers’ loyalty, with the people upholding their superiors—these are Qi’s treasures.\" Duke Zhuang immediately unbuckled his sword and departed.\n\nAlas! A man may have biases and obstructions yet live his whole life without self-awareness. The worthy see them and forgive in silence; petty men, in their violent affection, speak excessively; relatives, in their tender envy, sow discord. How can one with biases and obstructions fail to know oneself?\n\nThus, the noble person examines himself, ever as though he has faults. He wears his robes and eats his food, knowing his faults yet unable to correct them—this the noble person finds shameful. When about to speak, if he knows he cannot act accordingly, the noble person seldom speaks. When reproaching the masses for their faults, does he first examine his own goodness? When reproaching the masses for their depravity, does he first examine his own uprightness?\n\nAlas! This is what is called \"returning to clarity.\" The son of Zhai Xi was most filial and cautious. Zhai Xi, pitying his son, often spoke to him recklessly. At dawn, Zhai Xi would depart, and by dusk, he would return, saying, \"Jia is dead!\" His son believed him, yet soon after, Jia was alive and well. Another evening, he said, \"Yi is about to harm me!\" His son lay in wait, ready to avenge him, yet no enmity appeared. Another evening, he said, \"Ding is ill!\" His son observed him, but Ding was truly well. Such instances were countless. Over the years, the son remained filial and cautious, yet his training and discipline grew ever more unreliable.\n\nThe people of his village and state loathed his reckless speech and plotted to kill him. Zhai Xi, hearing this, grew fearful and returned to tell his son. The son did not fully believe him, but soon after, Zhai Xi was murdered. He reflected: those who speak excessively are deemed careless, yet there are also those whose words are few and guarded but whose secrecy is lacking; those who are fickle are deemed unsteady, yet there are also those whose demeanor is composed but whose hearts are restless; those who are meddlesome are deemed petty, yet there are also those whose outward appearance is pure but whose inner selves are impure. Such examples are too numerous to record. Without thorough understanding, how can one discern them clearly?\n\nThere are times when one must not respond to affairs—those whose inner selves are tranquil yet whose outer selves are active, easily moved but difficult to still. There are times when one must not seek after affairs—those who inwardly reflect yet outwardly wait, finding joy only when the moment arrives. Thus, those whose outer selves are tranquil yet whose inner selves are active disturb their thoughts and harm their nature; those who rush about chasing profit exhaust their strength and damage their reputation.\n\nIn this world, some encounter affairs that do not align with their aspirations and declare, \"I have not met with the times.\" This is no different from bearing the guilt of a crimson neck, awaiting the moment of execution—how perilous! Those with vast talent and comprehensive understanding who have yet to be recognized and employed may rightly say, \"The times are not unclean; my fate has not yet aligned.\" Is this not correct?\n\nThose skilled in remonstrance strive to preserve the nature of others while pruning the emotions from which their conduct arises. Thus, mutual openness and respect flourish, and intimacy deepens. Those unskilled in remonstrance strive to attack the nature of others while remaining ignorant of the origins of their emotions. Thus, mutual suspicion and estrangement grow daily.\n\nWhat children dismiss, the elderly condemn; what delights the eyes, the mind finds repugnant. To firmly condemn the foolishness of the world is to acknowledge one’s own lack of worthiness; to firmly condemn the delusion of the world is to acknowledge one’s own lack of clarity. To condemn the foolishness of the masses while lacking worthiness is to invite ruin; to condemn the delusion of the masses while lacking clarity is to invite harm.\n\n**Agricultural Dao, Eighth Chapter**\n\nIf people abandon fundamentals to pursue trifles, their commands will not be unified. Without unified commands, they cannot defend nor wage war. If people abandon fundamentals to pursue trifles, their production will be meager. With meager production, they will lightly drift and migrate. Lightly drifting and migrating, the state will frequently face disasters, and all will harbor distant aspirations, no longer settling their hearts.\n\nIf people abandon fundamentals to pursue trifles, they will favor cunning. Favoring cunning, they will be deceitful. With deceit, they will manipulate laws and decrees, turning right into wrong and wrong into right. The way the ancient sage-kings governed the people was to prioritize agriculture. People farming is not merely for the benefits of the land but to honor the fulfillment of their aspirations. When people farm, they are simple; when simple, they are easily employed; when easily employed, the borders are secure; when secure, the ruler’s position is exalted.\n\nWhen people farm, they are steadfast; when steadfast, they have little selfishness; with little selfishness, public laws are established, and strength is abundant and profound. When people farm, their production is restored; with restored production, they are reluctant to scatter; when reluctant to scatter, they die where they dwell, without divided thoughts. When the world is of one mind, the governance of the Yellow Emperor and Qi nearly pales in comparison.\n\nThe way the ancient sage-kings flourished plowing and weaving was to regard them as the foundation of instruction. Thus, the Son of Heaven personally led the feudal lords to plow the sacred field, and the ministers and officers all had their tasks, encouraging people to honor the earth’s bounty. The queen and consorts led the palace women to weave silk in the suburban mulberry fields and public fields, encouraging the diligence of women’s work.\n\nMen do not weave yet are clothed; women do not plow yet are fed. Men and women exchange their labor, supporting one another’s livelihood—this was the system of the sage-kings. Thus, they revered the seasons, cherished the days, measured the harvest, and assessed the work. They did not rest unless old or ill. One person’s labor fed ten. At that time, earthworks were not initiated, nor were troops mobilized. Men did not leave to defend the borders, and women did not marry outside, so as not to hinder agriculture.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said: \"The rectification of the four seasons lies solely in the proper cultivation of the five grains.\" Those who cultivate the crops are the people; those who give life to them are the earth; those who nourish them are Heaven. Thus, the space for planting must accommodate the hoe, the space for weeding must accommodate the hand—this is the Dao of plowing. Farmers attack food, artisans attack tools, and merchants attack goods. If timely affairs are not completed and are disrupted by earthworks, this is called great misfortune.\n\nFor all crops, those planted early precede the season; those planted late miss the season. If cold and heat are untimely, crops suffer many disasters. Fifty-seven days after the winter solstice, *changsheng* begins, and thus plowing commences. The Dao of farming is to plant when life appears and harvest when death arrives. Heaven sends forth the seasons, earth produces wealth—they do not make appointments with people. When the year is bountiful, the earth is worshipped; when the year is barren, the earth is not blamed, nor are people’s timeliness lost.\n\nAct when the time arrives, and cease when the time passes. The strength of the old and weak can be fully employed. Those who do not know the seasons act before the time arrives, long for it after it has passed, or belittle it when it is present—these are the inferior in their undertakings.\n\nWeeding must be done in drought to make the earth fertile and the soil loose. Crops desire to sprout in fine soil and take root in firm earth. Be cautious with seeds: do not sow them too densely nor too sparsely. The earth should not be insufficient nor excessive. Furrows should be deep and straight; fields should be fertile and level. The lower part receives shade, the upper part receives sunlight—then growth flourishes.\n\nWhen seedlings are in rows, they grow tall and strong. When the weak and strong do not harm one another, they grow swiftly and uniformly. Widen the rows, keep the centers open, and allow cool breezes to circulate—then the harvest will be abundant and the work fruitful. When observing the crops from afar, they appear lush, but upon approaching, they are sparse—this is the earth’s theft. If not removed, they become overgrown; if removed, the earth is depleted—this is the harm of the task.\n\nWhen seedlings are weak, they should grow alone; when they are tall, they should not be crowded.\n\nWhen crops wish to grow together, let the mature ones dwell in harmony; when they wish to support one another, form groups of three as a clan—then the harvest will yield abundant grain. The peril of seedlings lies not in their shared birth, but in their shared death. Thus, the early-sprouting ones produce fine rice, while the late-sprouting become chaff. Therefore, in weeding, nurture the elder and remove the younger. For fertile soil, do not allow overcrowding; for barren soil, do not permit solitary growth. Overcrowding in fertile soil yields much chaff; solitary growth in barren soil leads to many deaths. Those who do not understand weeding remove the elder and preserve the younger, failing to harvest grain while gathering only chaff. When upper and lower are unsettled, the crops die in great numbers.\n\nTimely millet grows tall with large ears, its grains round and husks thin, its rice sweet and fragrant, easy to hull and strengthening to eat. Untimely millet bears deep awns and slender stalks, its ears sharp and filled with chaff, its grains green and withered. Timely millet has long, awnless ears, its grains plump and husks few. Untimely millet grows thick stems, flowering stalks, and short, lush ears. Timely rice has sturdy stalks and long ears like a horse’s tail. Untimely rice has slender stalks that do not flourish, thick husks, and many deaths. Timely hemp has sparse nodes and a bright hue, its fibers strong and roots small. Untimely hemp grows dense branches, short stalks, coarse nodes, and worm-eaten leaves. Timely beans have long stalks and short stems, their pods arranged in pairs of seven as a clan, with many branches, numerous nodes, lush leaves, and heavy, nourishing beans. Untimely beans grow long and vine-like, with floating leaves, weak stems, sparse nodes, and small pods. Timely wheat grows tall with black necks, its rows arranged in pairs of seven, its glumes thin and color protective, strengthening those who eat it, making them robust. Untimely wheat swells with disease, its seedlings weak and ears sparse.\n\nThus, timely crops are bountiful, while untimely ones are meager. All grains, when cultivated at their proper time, nourish those who eat them, fortifying the four limbs, sharpening hearing and sight, preventing malign qi from entering the body, and averting misfortune. How excellent were Confucius’ words: “In winter, a full stomach warms the body; in summer, it cools it. When warmth and coolness are seasonally appropriate, people suffer no illness.” When people suffer no illness, epidemics do not spread, and all may fulfill their natural lifespan. Thus it is said: “Grain is the heaven of man.” Therefore, enlightened rulers prioritize agriculture. A ruler who does not prioritize agriculture abandons the people. And a ruler who abandons the people—what kingdom can he govern?\n\n*Military Strategy, Chapter Nine*\n\nDuke Jing of Qin sought to establish military supremacy across the realm. He dispatched Minister Bao Rong with a solemn charge, and awaited Kang Cangzi in twelve districts of fertile land. Pressed by urgency, Kang Cangzi arrived from Rongquan and was lodged in the upper guesthouse. For three days, the Duke found no opportunity to consult him. Descending from his mat, he faced north, prostrated himself, and struck his jade tablet to the ground, saying: \"Does Heaven truly have no intention to succor the orphaned?\"\n\nKang Cangzi’s gaze softened as he replied: \"I took Your Lordship to be asking of extraordinary matters—why then do you trouble yourself with such trivialities? Whether one wields the axe or thrusts the blade, all follows desire to attain correctness. What more could be desired?\"\n\nThe Duke bowed once, then twice, straightened his embroidered robe, adjusted his jade tablet, lowered his head, and sat, saying: \"It is truly as Heaven commands.\"\n\nKang Cangzi looked up at the rafters and sighed, then composed his expression and said: \"I wish to speak of the origins of warfare, which arose together with the first men. Warfare is the manifestation of human might. Since human might is endowed by Heaven, the roots of warfare extend to the highest realms. There has never been a moment when it was not employed. From noble to base, elder to youth, wise to foolish—all alike perceive the signs of war within their hearts. Harboring resentment before it erupts is war. Glowering with fierce eyes and changing countenance is war. Harsh words and violent gestures are war. Extravagant quarrels and armed conflict are war. These four are but disputes of great and small. Even before Chiyou’s time, men already brandished timber to fight. The Yellow Emperor employed water and fire. Gonggong stirred rebellion. The Five Emperors contended with one another.\"\n\nWhen one rises and another falls, the victorious takes command. Yet there are those who die from swallowing medicine—would it be right to ban all physicians in the world? There are those who drown while boarding a boat—would it be right to ban all ships? There are those who lose their states through warfare—would it be right to ban all arms? The abolition of arms is as impossible as the abolition of water and fire. When well employed, they bring fortune; when misused, they bring disaster. Thus, anger and punishment cannot be abolished within a household, nor can penal laws be abolished within a state, nor can armed campaigns be abolished under Heaven. The sage-kings of antiquity waged righteous wars but never sought to abolish warfare. When arms are truly righteous, they punish tyrannical rulers and rescue the suffering—people rejoice as a filial son beholds his loving parent, or as a starving man encounters fine food. They rush forward with cries, swift as a powerful crossbow loosing its bolt into a deep valley. Victory or defeat need not be sought elsewhere, for it returns to human nature. All people desire life and hate death, desire honor and hate disgrace. When the Way of life and death, honor and disgrace is unified, the soldiers of the Three Armies may be made of one mind.\n\nAn army desires numbers, but even more, it desires unity of heart. When the Three Armies are of one mind, commands may be issued without fear of resistance. The supreme army values its commands above all. Where its commands are strong, its enemies are weak; where its commands are trusted, its enemies yield. Victory secured here is victory secured there. If this is truly so, what enemy could prevail?\n\nWhen enemies advance, they do so in pursuit of gain. If, upon arriving, they find only death, and flight becomes their advantage, then all enemies will see flight as advantageous—and blades will never meet. This is the supreme army.\n\nCruelty, oppression, deceit, and righteous principle stand in opposition. Their forces cannot both prevail; they cannot coexist. Thus, when a righteous army enters enemy territory, the people know where to seek refuge. When it reaches the outskirts of cities and towns, it does not trample crops, does not desecrate graves, does not plunder stores, does not burn homes. Captives are returned unharmed, promises are kept, and the spoils of war are used to demonstrate good and evil, to show defiance and compliance. If, despite this, there remain those who stubbornly resist, act with brutality, or defy authority, then the use of force is justified.\n\nFirst, a proclamation is issued: \"Our army comes to avenge the wronged and align with the Dao of Heaven. When we conquer a state, we do not massacre its people but punish only the guilty.\" Then, the virtuous and worthy are selected and honored, the orphaned and infirm are sought out and cared for, the treasuries are opened and their wealth distributed, the granaries are emptied and their grain given away. Nothing is kept for private gain, and courtesy is extended to all. If a man could revive the dead, the world would rush to serve him—how much more so when a righteous army revives not one but many? Who would not rejoice? Thus, when a righteous army arrives, the people of neighboring states flock to it like flowing water, and the people of the conquered state look upon it as their parents. The farther it marches, the more people it gains.\n\nBefore the words were finished, the lord rose, bowed deeply, and said, \"I have heard your teachings and feel my qi fill the universe. My will now knows its direction, and my heart is ever more reverent.\" Then he stepped forward, raised a cup in toast to honor Kang Cangzi, bowed to take the foremost place among his disciples, and arranged his seat with solemnity in the purification chamber. For over a month, he observed the cycles of the heavens, passing through the Celestial Gate, practicing the Dao even in broad daylight, and conducting himself with the rites of a disciple.

      "translated_text": "**Imperially Commissioned Complete Library of the Four Treasuries**\n**Section: Masters (Subsection 14) – Abstract**\n\n*Kangcangzi*\n\n**Daoist Category**\n\nWe, your ministers, respectfully note: The *Kangcangzi* in one fascicle is traditionally attributed to Gengsang Chu. Liu Zongyuan of the Tang once expressed doubts about its authorship. Both Chao Gongwu’s *Record of Reading* and Gao Sisun’s *Catalogue of Masters* state that during the Kaiyuan and Tianbao eras of the Tang, Gengsangzi was revered as the *Dongling Zhenjing* (\"True Classic of the Cavernous Numinous\"), but the text itself could not be obtained. Later, Wang Shiyuan, a reclusive scholar from Xiangyang, compiled passages from various masters and presented them as the *Kangcangzi*. Zhou Li, in his *Brush Notes*, excerpted the phrase \"selecting scholars through literary examinations in perilous times,\" as well as the line \"in a single village, a single county, a single prefecture, one dons the purple robes of office,\" asserting that these referred to Tang institutions. Song Lian’s *Discernment of Masters* also noted that the text’s use of \"people\" in place of \"commoners\" and \"generation\" in place of \"era\" was an avoidance of Taizong’s taboo, concluding that the work was composed by a Tang scholar.\n\nUpon examination, the preface to Meng Haoran’s collected works, written by Wang Shiyuan of Xuancheng, states that he \"revised the nine chapters of the *Kangcangzi*.\" Additionally, Wei Tao’s preface from the ninth year of Tianbao (750) also mentions Wang Shiyuan of Xuancheng, praising his \"lucid and profound literary style, his deep understanding of principles, and his frequent sojourns in mountains and waters, far from the world of men,\" while noting that he \"composed several chapters of the *Kangcangzi* to transmit to later generations.\" Thus, this text was in fact supplemented by Shiyuan and was not a forgery. Though later scholars raised doubts, they did so without proper investigation.\n\nHowever, Gengsang Chu, who dwelled in Weilei, is mentioned only in the *Zhuangzi*, while the *Records of the Grand Historian*’s \"Biography of Zhuang Zhou\" states that Zhuangzi’s works, such as the *Weilei* and *Kangcangzi*, were mere empty words devoid of factual basis. Whether such a figure ever existed remains uncertain, much like the nebulous figures of Hongmeng and Yunjiang. The *Han Bibliographies* and *Sui Bibliographies* do not record this text. How, then, could it have emerged in the Tang without any foundation? It is likely that Shiyuan had already composed this work, and the court Daoists—such as Ye Fashan and Luo Gongyuan—further propagated it, creating the conditions for an imperial decree to seek it out. Shiyuan’s own preface mentions that in the fourth year of Tianbao (745), he was summoned to the capital, which coincided with the completion of the text. This serves as clear evidence.\n\nYet Shiyuan was himself a man of letters, and though his work culls phrases from the *Laozi*, *Zhuangzi*, *Liezi*, *Wenzi*, *Book of Lord Shang*, *Lüshi Chunqiu*, Liu Xiang’s *Shuoyuan* and *Xinxu*, he weaves them together with remarkable coherence and reason, setting it apart from other spurious texts. Its frequent use of archaic and obscure characters aligns with the style of Wei Yuan song and Yuan Bao, prompting Chao Gongwu to remark that \"those lacking inner substance often resort to external embellishment,\" which aptly diagnoses its flaw. Such is the habit of literary men fond of novelty, and we shall not dwell on it further.\n\nThe *Chongwen General Catalogue* lists it as nine chapters, while Ma Duanlin’s *Comprehensive Examination of Literature* records it in two fascicles. Song Lian’s *Discernment of Masters* gives it as five fascicles. This edition, however, contains only one fascicle, though its chapter count matches the *Chongwen General Catalogue*, suggesting it may preserve the original form.\n\n---\n\n*Commentary on the Kangcangzi*\n\n**Daoist Category**\n\nWe, your ministers, respectfully note: The commentary on the *Kangcangzi* in nine chapters is traditionally attributed to He Can, though his era is unrecorded. Liu Zongyuan, in his *Reading the Kangcangzi*, observed that neither Liu Xiang nor Ban Gu included the *Kangcangzi* in their bibliographies, yet those who practiced its arts had already begun transmitting and annotating it for the world. Thus, commentaries existed as early as Zongyuan’s time, though he did not specify the commentator’s name. Chao Gongwu’s *Record of Reading* lists the *Kangcangzi* in two fascicles with commentary by He Zan. As Gongwu lived between the Northern and Southern Song, He Zan must have lived before the Northern Song. The character \"Zan\" (瓚) in this edition differs slightly from \"Can\" (粲), likely due to a scribal variant. The commentary is concise and unadorned, lacking the florid language of the Song and later periods, suggesting it may be the same commentary Zongyuan encountered.\n\nThe text also includes phonetic glosses, which were added by Huang Jian of the Ming. At the end of the volume is a postscript by Jian, who was skilled in archaic characters. His work, *Following Antiquity to Rectify Texts*, is replete with eccentric and impractical forms. The *Kangcangzi*’s frequent use of obscure characters aligned with Jian’s scholarly pursuits, so he gladly provided phonetic annotations. However, these glosses are interspersed with the commentary, making it impossible to distinguish them—a pernicious habit of Ming scholars who tampered with ancient texts.\n\nGao Sisun’s *Catalogue of Masters* erroneously attributes the *Kangcangzi* to Wang Bao, an egregious error. Huang Jian’s postscript also claims it was written by Wang Bao, failing to correct the mistake. This is unsurprising, as Jian’s life’s work centered on shocking the world with bizarre characters to gain fame, and he did not delve deeply into other matters.\n\n**Respectfully collated and presented in the tenth month of the forty-sixth year of the Qianlong reign.**\n\n**Chief Compilers:**\nYour Ministers Ji Yun, Lu Xixiong, Sun Shiyi\n\n**Chief Collator:**\nYour Minister Lu Feichi\n\n*Imperially Commissioned Complete Library of the Four Treasuries – Kangcangzi*",

      "translated_text": "**The Complete Dao, Chapter One**\n\nKangcangzi dwelled on the slopes of Mount Yu for three years. The customs of the land knew no plague or pestilence, and the grain harvests were ever abundant. The people whispered among themselves: *\"When Kangcangzi first arrived, we thought him strange. Yet now, though we reckon our days and find them wanting, when we count the year, we find it full. Could he be a sage? Why not honor him as we honor the spirits of the soil and grain?\"*\n\nKangcangzi, hearing this, wore an expression of disquiet. His disciple Yanche followed and asked him about it. Kangcangzi said: *\"I have heard that the perfected person dwells in a humble abode, yet the people run wild, heedless of where they go. Now, in this land of Yu, fathers and sons whisper in secret—do they take me for one who seeks sacrificial vessels and offerings? This is why I cannot dismiss the words of Lao Dan.\"*\n\nYanche said: *\"Not so. In shallow pools, great fish have no room to turn, and so the minnows and eels rule them. On low hills, mighty beasts have no place to hide, and so the foxes and wildcats claim them as omens. Moreover, honoring the worthy, serving the capable, inclining toward goodness, and pursuing profit—this has been the way since Yao and Shun. How much more should it be so for the people of Yu?

      "translated_text": "Kangcangzi said: *\"Alas! Come, you two—do you understand? The beast in the trap leaves the mountain and is ensnared by nets and snares; the fish that swallows boats strays from the water and is tormented by ants and mole-crickets. Thus birds and beasts dwell where they may soar high, fish and turtles where they may plunge deep. For those who preserve their form and life, to conceal themselves is only to seek depth and obscurity—nothing more. Let me tell you: is this not the root of great disorder? Will it endure even between Yao and Shun? A thousand generations hence, there will surely be men who devour one another.\"*\n\nBefore he had finished speaking, Nanzi Rongzhu’s expression shifted abruptly, and he rose from his mat, saying: *\"I, Rongzhu, have long lived by the turning of the years—how shall I entrust my work to these words?\"*\n\nKangcangzi said: *\"Preserve your form, embrace your life, and let not your thoughts and cares flutter about like this. Then, perhaps, you may live to see such times. Though this be so, my talent is meager and insufficient to transform you. Why not journey south to seek my teacher, Dan?\"*\n\nKangcangzi then declined Rongzhu’s request, unwilling to abandon the customs of Yu and depart like a dragon. The nature of water in the world is to be clear, yet earth muddies it, so it cannot remain clear. The nature of man is to be long-lived, yet things muddy it, so it cannot endure. This is why one nurtures the nature. Now, the deluded of this age often use their nature to nurture things, unaware of what is light and what is heavy. Thus, the sage in regard to sounds, colors, and flavors—if they benefit the nature, he takes them; if they harm the nature, he discards them. This is the Dao of preserving the nature.\n\nWhen ten thousand men draw their bows to shoot at a single target, the target cannot but be struck.

Whether above as Son of Heaven or below as a common man, he remains neither arrogant nor dejected.

      "translated_text": "The Lord of Chen Huai dispatched his minister to perform a ceremonial visit to Lu, where Viscount Shusun privately inquired, \"Does your state have a sage? Do you know of him?\" The minister of Chen replied, \"How can one clearly demonstrate his sageliness?\" Viscount Shusun said, \"He can discard the mind and employ the form.\" The minister of Chen said, \"Though our humble state is small, it too has a sage, one unlike what you have heard. May I ask whom you refer to as a sage?\" The minister of Chen replied, \"There is one called Kang Cangzi, who has fully attained the Dao of Lao Dan. He can use his ears to see and his eyes to hear.\"\n\nDuke Ding of Lu, having heard this, found it extraordinary. He sent the Viscount Shusun to return the visit and extend an invitation to Kang Cangzi, receiving him with the rites due to a senior minister. When Kang Cangzi arrived, he was lodged in the secondary guest quarters. The Duke of Lu, speaking with humble words, questioned him. Kang Cangzi said, \"I can see and hear without using my ears and eyes. It is not that the ears and eyes have exchanged their functions; rather, what they convey is excessive.\"\n\nThe Duke said, \"How can this be? I am increasingly astonished. What is the nature of your Way? I truly wish to hear it.\" Kang Cangzi said, \"My body harmonizes with my mind, my mind with my qi, my qi with my spirit, and my spirit with the formless. There is the sound of resolute presence and the resonance of serene emptiness. Though distant, reaching beyond the eight wilds, or near, within the space between the brows, whatever comes to me, I know it completely. Yet I do not know whether it is my seven apertures, limbs, six viscera, five organs, or the thoughts of my heart that perceive it—it is simply self-awareness.\"\n\n**Using the Dao, Second Chapter**\n\nHeaven cannot be trusted, earth cannot be trusted, people cannot be trusted, the heart cannot be trusted—only the Dao can be trusted. How could worthy rulers and outstanding scholars know this?\n\nIn ancient times, Jie trusted heaven and relied on his dominion over the four seas, yet he did not diligently follow the Dao. Heaven took his state and bestowed it upon Yin. Zhou likewise trusted heaven and relied on his dominion over the four seas, yet he did not reverently follow the Dao. Heaven took his state and bestowed it upon Zhou.\n\nNow, the indolent farmer trusts the earth to truly produce the hundred grains, yet he does not exert himself in the Way of cultivation. The earth steals his harvest and leaves it overgrown and barren. The late Qi ruler trusted human nature, believing in yielding and deference, yet he was not enlightened in the Way. He handed over his entire realm to others, who, like owls and jackals, seized his state.\n\nOrdinary people do not cultivate the Dao but follow their hearts as teachers, pursuing desires that flourish and multiply. Disasters, illnesses, conflicts, and injuries befall them, harming their bodies and shortening their lives—all because the heart is the source of harm.\n\nThus, it is said: Only the Dao can be trusted. Heaven and earth cannot endure without the Dao. The common people cannot be pacified without the worthy. The myriad affairs cannot be harmonized without talent.\n\nThose who employ the Dao do not reveal their use. Blessings nurture the ten thousand things, and merit returns to the formless. Their spirit merges, their undertakings flourish, their auspiciousness is enduring, and their wisdom is discerning. To know and distinguish is called knowledge; to know and not distinguish is called the Dao. Knowledge is for governing others; the Dao is for pacifying others.\n\nThe rooster crows at dawn, and the laborer bears the sun’s burden, toiling until sweat soaks the earth. At midnight, he barely rests—this is the Way of the farmer. Bending down to gather, reaching up to take, sharpening his wits, straining his thoughts, striving for profit—this is the Way of the merchant. Swallowing qi, nurturing the spirit, restraining thoughts, reducing concerns, transcending the mundane, refining the essence, and ascending as an immortal—this is the Way of the lofty scholar. Cutting off emotions, focusing the mind, dedicating oneself to duty, forgetting sleep to devise plans, and striving for office to serve others—this is the Way of the minister. Purifying the mind, reducing desires, examining close associates, seeking the worthy and good to pacify the myriad people—this is the Way of the ruler.\n\nIf each follows their proper path, aligning with their aspirations and not neglecting their duties, their undertakings will flourish. This is called \"the world possessing the Dao.\" Guiding the sinews and bones preserves the body; shearing desires preserves the spirit; quieting speech preserves fortune. To preserve all three is called \"pure worthiness.\" When virtue is aligned, ghosts and spirits assist; when trust and righteousness are sincere, the noble are drawn near; when ritual and propriety are complete, the petty people submit.\n\nThe discerning consider themselves correct, and the ignorant also consider themselves correct. Those with the Dao are tranquil and silent, and the dull-witted are also tranquil and silent. Things inherently have what seems right but is wrong, and what seems wrong but is right. Some first wail and later laugh; some begin auspiciously and end in misfortune. Some bodies may be close, but their talents cannot be; some talents may be respected, but their bodies are unworthy. Excessive respect leads to distance; excessive closeness leads to disrespect. Being too close creates estrangement; being estranged fosters closeness. Excessive kindness breeds resentment; excessive love breeds hatred. Some value speed, some value slowness; some value straightness, some value crookedness. The appropriateness of all things is subtle and must be understood.\n\nThus, the wise find it difficult: in stillness, their spirit is penetrating; in poverty, their intent is penetrating; in nobility, their words are penetrating; in wealth, their bodies are penetrating—such is the principle of circumstance.\n\nThose who share the Dao love one another; those who share skills envy one another. Those who give together love one another; those who take together envy one another. Those who share suffering love one another; those who share strength envy one another—such is the natural human sentiment.\n\nTo be talented yet humble, poor and lowly yet not obsequious, to endure toil without feeling humiliated, to be rich and noble yet respectful and diligent—this is called possessing virtue.\n\n**Governing the Dao, Third Chapter**\n\nPeople have no method to know heaven; they know heaven through the movements of the four seasons, cold and heat, the sun, moon, and stars. If the movements of the four seasons, cold and heat, the sun, moon, and stars are proper, then all living beings with blood and qi will find their place and rest in their production.\n\nMinisters likewise have no method to know their ruler; they know the ruler through the ruler’s bestowal of rewards, punishments, ranks, and emoluments. If the ruler’s bestowal of rewards, punishments, ranks, and emoluments is fitting, then the close and distant, the worthy and unworthy will all exhaust their talents and be employed.\n\nWhen trust is complete, the world is at peace; when trust is lost, the world is in peril. If the people toil exhaustively and their resources are depleted, their hearts will generate strife and harm, and they will no longer trust.\n\nPeople do not trust because governance is uneven. The unevenness of governance is the fault of the officials. The fault of the officials lies in the inconsistency of punishments and rewards. The inconsistency of punishments and rewards stems from the ruler’s lack of diligence and clarity.\n\nIf the ruler is diligent and clear, punishments and rewards will be unified. If punishments and rewards are unified, officials will uphold the law. If officials uphold the law, governance will be disseminated below. If governance is disseminated below, each person will attain their proper place, and mutual trust will be established.\n\nThus, it is known that the world’s lack of trust arises from the ruler’s lack of diligence and clarity.\n\nKang Cangzi resided in Xirang for five years. King Ling of Chu sent the Duke of Zhai with gifts of silk and fine jade, saying, \"I, an unworthy youth, have been remiss in virtue and occupy this position. Now, floods and droughts come unseasonably. As a ruler of men, how can I avert them?\"\n\nKang Cangzi said, \"Floods are the disorder of yin. Yin prevails in state governance when punishments are excessive and human affairs are dominated by selfishness. Drought is the excess of yang. Yang prevails in state governance when virtue is lacking and human affairs are marked by arrogance. The state of Chu has repeatedly suffered floods and droughts. The Son of Heaven should rectify punishments and cultivate virtue; the hundred officials should eliminate selfishness and guard against arrogance. Thus, disasters will be averted, and a hundred blessings will arrive daily.\"\n\nIn Zheng, there was the Hu jade tablet and the Rong bow, which were lost together to Jing. Jing said, \"You must return the jade tablet and Rong bow; otherwise, we will bring our army against you.\" The ruler of Zheng was troubled and went to see Kang Cangzi, saying, \"The jade tablet and Rong bow were inherited from our former rulers, who obtained them from Hu. For generations, they have been treasured heirlooms, symbols of our lineage’s glory. Now, Jing relies on its size and demands them. If we do not comply, they will bring their army—our state is in peril!\"",

How then can I know what in the world is truly lovable or truly detestable? Thus, I do not perceive things as worthy of attachment. Without such abilities to disturb my true nature, I remain untainted.\"",

      "translated_text": "\"I wish to send other jade tablets and bows in their place—what should I do?\"\nKang Cangzi replied, \"Your Lordship should remain calm for now. Even Chu possesses treasures here. Adorn Chu’s treasures and offer them to atone for your offense—something Chu cannot do. You must present the genuine articles. Now, Jing, on account of a trifling grievance, wields its might and punishment, flaunting its power without justice, draining and plundering its allies. Jing will lose the allegiance of the feudal lords. When the lords hear of this, they will take heed, be admonished, prepare diligently, and strive for clarity. At the next assembly, righteousness will prevail, and Zheng shall stand foremost. Your Lordship, bide your time—could this not be a blessing?\"\n\nThus, he sent the Hu jade tablet and Rong bow. Before they reached Ying, the people of Jing heard of it and said, \"They heed the counsel of a sage and refuse our demands. How can we seize these by force and expose our injustice to the world, thereby sowing discontent among the feudal lords?\" They promptly returned the gifts and treated Zheng with even greater kindness.\n\nHuman nature desires life and abhors death, seeks security and shuns peril, craves honor and detests disgrace. When the people attain their desires, they rejoice; when they rejoice, they are at peace. When they do not attain their desires, they suffer; when they suffer, they are in danger. If a ruler indulges his desires, the hundred officials and myriad elders will all pursue theirs. When the hundred officials and myriad elders pursue their desires, the people of the world—whether poor or rich—will exhaust their strength or deplete their wealth. The four classes will lose their proper order, and none will attain their desires.\n\nWhen the people of the world do not attain their desires, they will join hands, cling together, flee, hide, drift, or forage to preserve their lives. If officials then pursue and capture them, their peril and suffering will become unbearable, giving rise to thoughts of rebellion. Thus, the state will no longer be their state.\n\nDo not covet a large population—your people will scatter, and the strong will flee. Do not exhaust your people—your cities and ramparts will be manned by the weary. If taxes are excessive, the impoverished will grow poorer daily. If punishments are inconsistent, the destitute will grow more destitute daily. If laws and prohibitions are not enforced, the state will collapse. If officials are unfit, leniency and severity will be misapplied. If you compete with the people for profit, deceitful hearts will arise. Thus, the people will grow cunning and hard to fathom, and the realm will become inscrutable. When the ruler is suspicious, the people grow more confused. When the people are confused, officials toil in vain. When officials toil in vain, rewards fail to encourage, and punishments fail to deter. The state will be easily stirred and hard to pacify—all because officials are not the right people.\n\nThe essence of governance lies in carefully selecting men of talent. Those whose talent and conduct excel in a village should be entrusted with its affairs. Those who excel in a county should be entrusted with its affairs. Those who excel in a province should be entrusted with its affairs. Those who excel in the state should be entrusted with its governance. Only then can hidden talents be fully employed.\n\nIf a man’s wickedness disrupts his village, admonish him. If he does not reform, he is wicked in his county—flog him. If he still does not reform, he is wicked in the state—execute him. Only then can rebelliousness be eradicated. If this is done, every person in the world will stand in awe and reverence, with no trace of defiance, flattery, or insolence. This is called \"pacifying the people.\"\n\nOf all the affairs of the world, none is greater than seeking men of talent. The best way to await their discovery is through sound governance. The best way to achieve sound governance is by pacifying the people. The talent for pacifying the people may be assessed thus: by literary composition, scarcely four or five in a hundred qualify; by eloquence, perhaps one or two in ten; but by their demeanor in handling the sacred regalia of state, eight or nine in ten are fully capable. Such is the discernment of sagacious kings in prosperous times, their ability to select and employ men.\n\nIf, in a declining reign or perilous age, men are chosen by literary composition, cunning and ostentation will flourish, while true refinement and simplicity will recede. If chosen by eloquence, glibness and embellishment will abound, while forthrightness and integrity will fade. If chosen by demeanor in handling the sacred regalia, outward propriety will mask inner deceit, while genuine purity and substance will remain hidden. In such cases, the more worthy men are sought, the more governance will stray; the more decrees are issued, the more the people will be thrown into chaos.\n\nThe realm is the greatest of all vessels; the throne of the Son of Heaven is the weightiest of all positions.",

      "translated_text": "To secure men of talent is to bring order; to lose them is to invite chaos. Thus, the ruler toils in seeking the worthy and finds ease in employing them. Alas! He who guards the state and gathers its people—how can he neglect to test and examine his officers?\n\nWhen human nature is led astray, it is the sovereign’s deepest concern. Of all such deviations, none is more grievous than the miscarriage of justice. The wise and discerning, when adjudicating disputes, may be lured by deceit, coerced by power, swayed by emotion, or hardened by punishment. Though their methods differ, they must ever uphold impartiality, so that the people of the realm live without cause for gratitude and die without ground for resentment.\n\nHe who governs the state, establishes officials, and administers punishment in this manner may be called the consummate ruler. In such an age of consummate governance, the hearts of the people are harmonious and upright, all livelihoods are fitting, reverence and affection run deep, and the bonds between high and low are firm—unshaken as a single household. If even one household strays from compliance and defies the natural order, how can the realm remain stable?\n\nWhen King Ping returned to the rightful capital and settled in the celestial city, he diligently sought the worthy and the good. Upon hearing even a single word of merit, he would deliberate for days. His attendants and servants repeatedly spoke of ministers who were exceptionally talented. After more than a year of this, the king declared: “I, alone, am lacking in virtue and wisdom. Though I strive to seek the worthy, I fear that those hidden in the mountains and marshes remain overlooked. How could I delight in hearing of goodness only to shut myself off from it?”\n\nYet in the past, flattering courtiers had heaped praise upon the powerful, gradually elevating them through the favor of his attendants. My own weakness and dullness left me unable to discern clearly, so I merely assented or compromised, allowing their self-regard to grow and their virtue to decay—no fault was greater than this. Failing to correct them in time, I let factions take root. Thus, I executed three of my closest attendants in the marketplace and demoted five high-ranking officials, declaring: “Let no minister curry favor with inferiors while deceiving his sovereign, nor cling to office by bending to others’ will.”\n\nWhen the realm heard this, they praised his clarity and wisdom. From the seven states west of the Southern Sea, men flocked to submit. In this age of supreme governance, carriages and robes were plain and unadorned, laws were lenient and simple, and prohibitions were few and broad. When carriages and robes were plain, people did not covet excess; when laws were lenient, customs knew no taboos; when prohibitions were broad, transgressions were easy to avoid yet hard to commit.\n\nIf people do not covet excess, desires wane and they gladly serve in their labors. If customs know no taboos, restraints lift and joyful exchange flourishes. If transgressions are easy to avoid yet hard to commit, good and evil become distinct, and men value virtue and know shame. To gladly serve in labor is called compliance; to engage in joyful exchange is called harmony; to value virtue and know shame is called uprightness. The dissolute cannot prevail against compliance, the rebellious cannot prevail against harmony, and the wicked cannot prevail against uprightness. Compliance, harmony, and uprightness—these are the foundations of governance.\n\nIn declining and decadent ages, carriages and robes grow ornate and cunning, laws become superstitious and convoluted, and prohibitions turn harsh and perverse. When carriages and robes are ornate, admiration for luxury spreads; when laws are superstitious, taboos multiply; when prohibitions are perverse, none know how to escape them. If admiration for luxury spreads, men grow disloyal and shameless, scorning simplicity and prizing ostentation. If taboos multiply, emotions and intentions are stifled, and high and low grow estranged. If none know how to escape prohibitions, defenses multiply and the people no longer fear death.",

      "translated_text": "When men scorn simplicity and prize ostentation, this is called \"floating\"; when high and low grow estranged, this is called \"blockage\"; when none fear death, this is called \"recklessness.\" The truly upright do not serve in \"floating\" regimes; the just and forthright do not serve in \"blocked\" ones; the capable and skilled do not serve in \"reckless\" ones. Floating, blockage, and recklessness—these three are the ladders to national chaos.\n\nKing Xiong Yu of Jing asked about floods, droughts, order, and disorder. Kang Cangzi replied: \"Floods and droughts come from Heaven; order and disorder come from man. If human affairs are harmonious and well-governed, even floods and droughts cannot cause harm—such were the cases of Yao and Tang.\" He continued: \"Thus, the Zhou system of official ranks states: 'Man’s strength overcomes Heaven.' If human affairs are corrupted and disordered, even without floods or droughts, the state will daily crumble and collapse. Were Jie and Zhou’s downfalls merely due to floods and droughts?\" The King of Jing faced north, bowed in reverence, and said: \"Heaven has not abandoned this unworthy one to hear such words.\" He then presented ten pairs of fine jade disks to honor Kang Cangzi, bowed again, and appointed him as Vice Minister, saying: \"Perhaps my state may yet recover.\"\n\nKang Cangzi, unable to refuse, spent the night in contemplation, then disguised himself and fled to another region. In a well-governed age, mountains harbor no false recluses, markets yield no illicit profits, courts grant no sycophantic emoluments, and the state’s resources are distributed. How does one obtain such people and pure customs? Kang Cangzi said: \"When governance is oppressive and harsh, people grow cunning and false; when governance is simple and unified, people grow honest and pure. Customs follow the shape of state policy as a looper caterpillar conforms to the leaf. Eat yellow, and the body turns yellow; eat green, and the body turns green.\"\n\n\"How then can the people be enriched?\" Kang Cangzi replied: \"Levy taxes in due season, and if officials are clear and frugal, the people will prosper. If taxes are levied without restraint and officials are extravagant and indulgent, the people will grow poor. The arrowheads of Gou Yue are forged from refined metal, their fletching made from the feathers of fierce falcons. As cudgels, they differ little from rough wood, but when fitted to a powerful crossbow and loosed in battle, they strike down foes three hundred paces away. The *Feijing* sword’s might outshines the sun, its qi surging like purple mist. As a kitchen knife, it differs little from a dull blade, but when wielded against raging bandits and turbulent foes, none within a thousand *li* can stand before it. Thus, materials have their proper divisions, and uses have their proper applications. What matters is skillfully adapting to the times.\n\nIn ancient times, enlightened kings and sagely emperors brought peace to the world, allowing all things to flourish and all natures to reach their full potential. They adapted to the times without meddling. In recent ages, the world teems with the cunning and deceitful, while the upright are few; the frivolous and profit-seeking abound, while the steadfast and retiring are rare. The deceitful out-talk the loyal, leading the world’s people to mutual suspicion and harm. Alas! When establishing laws, ease of avoidance and difficulty of violation should be prized. When remedying abuses, simplicity of affairs and uniformity of commands should be prized. Eliminate the overbearing, and officials will be at ease; enforce punishments and prohibitions strictly, and officials will not dare pursue private gain, enriching the people. The *Shi Xing* states: 'When disasters strike, grant amnesties.' But amnesties should not be frequent, for frequent amnesties allow the wicked to scheme, while the innocent grow resentful, and the worthy and good are obstructed.\n\nWhen men commit great crimes and harm, officials arrest them and expand the investigation, falsely implicating the innocent, dragging in the distant and unrelated, hoping to shift blame and timing—only for the culprits to receive amnesty. Those harmed find no satisfaction, only self-inflicted torment. Thus, the innocent devise ever more cunning schemes, officials toil under harsh governance, and none can quell the chaos. This is the fault of frequent amnesties. Men avoid wickedness and injustice because of punishment, and strive for virtue and righteousness because of reward. Now, the wicked and unjust are pardoned, while the virtuous and righteous are harmed and go unrewarded. Is it not difficult to expect men to pursue goodness?\n\nIn an age with worthy rulers and outstanding scholars, those who examine this discourse will find that the people’s resentment is not due to neglecting them, nor the gods’ anger due to failing to serve them. The more cunning and flattery prevail, the more the people resent; the more excessive sacrifices abound, the more the gods rage.\"\n\n**Chapter Four: The Way of the Ruler**\n\nWhat gives life is Heaven; what nurtures and completes it is man. To nurture what Heaven has given without encroaching upon it is called the Son of Heaven. The Son of Heaven’s actions aim to preserve Heaven’s wholeness—this is how officials establish themselves. Officials are established to preserve life. Yet today’s deluded rulers multiply offices only to harm life, losing the very foundation of officialdom.\n\nWhen grasses are stifled, they rot; when trees are stifled, they become infested; when men are stifled, they fall ill; when states are stifled, a hundred evils arise, and danger and chaos cannot be restrained. A \"stifled state\" means the ruler’s virtue is not disseminated, and the people’s desires are not conveyed upward. Thus, sagely kings value loyal ministers and upright scholars, for they dare to speak frankly and dispel blockages. Restraining oneself and returning to ritual, the worthy will come of their own accord. Plowing the sacred field and performing the *houji* sacrifice, the common people will transform naturally. From this, it is clear: the worthy and upright can be awaited, not sought. Those sought are not truly worthy. The common people can be transformed, not punished. Punishment without principle is not governance.\n\nYao and Shun labored as rulers for the people but had no desires as rulers. Thus, the world each attained their desires. They held the position of ruler but had no ruler’s possessive heart. Thus, the world each gave free rein to their hearts. There are scholars loved by the world whom the ruler does not love, and those loved only by the ruler whom the world does not love. Employing those loved by the world brings peace; employing those loved only by the ruler brings peril. How can a ruler indulge his personal likes and dislikes? Thus, one who values the world must restrain his emotions. The \"world\" refers to its myriad things; a \"state\" refers to its multitudes. The state takes the people as its root; when the people are at peace, the state is at peace. Therefore, a ruler concerned for the state must seek to govern the people’s talents.\n\nJade is hard to distinguish because of strange stones; gold is hard to distinguish because of brass. Now, if a sparrow’s wings are draped over a quail, the dim-sighted will see no difference. But the clear-sighted will see it is a quail. If a petty man recites classics and medical texts, studies arcane arts, or masters persuasive speech, and is clad in blue and purple robes, the foolish will hear and see him as a gentleman. But the discerning will hear and see him as a petty man. Thus, if a ruler is truly enlightened, judging men by their words is proper, by their talents is proper, by their conduct is proper. If a ruler is unenlightened, judging men by their words brings chaos, by their talents brings chaos, by their conduct brings chaos.\n\nThe sage in employing men values the ear.",

If admiration for luxury spreads, men grow disloyal and shameless, scorning simplicity and prizing ostentation. If taboos multiply, emotions and intentions are stifled, and high and low grow estranged. If none know how to escape prohibitions, defenses multiply and the people no longer fear death.",

      "translated_text": "The achievements of what is unheard, unseen, and inexpressible allow the people to govern themselves with ease. If a ruler values what is heard, the people of the world will transport goods and chase profit to curry favor. If a ruler values what is seen, the people of the world will flaunt strange forms and arts to vie for advancement. If a ruler values what can be expressed, the people of the world will train their tongues and lips to adorn their words. Should the people of the world curry favor, vie for advancement, and adorn their words to gain access, governance will fail.\n\nAll rulers know that a mirror clarifies their appearance, yet they detest when officials do the same. A mirror clarifies their appearance—its benefit is small. Officials clarify their appearance—its benefit is great. To know the small and lose the great is ignorance indeed.\n\nAlas! If a ruler clears the mind and reduces affairs, and officials are reverent, frugal, and adhere to their duties, great peace will swiftly arrive. Yet some rulers find this difficult—why, I do not know. If the ruler’s heart is unclear and indecisive, then the harmony of heaven and earth, the order within the four seas, and the Dao of all living things will be lost.\n\nThose who select officials by ear and eye have many officials and chaotic governance. Those who select officials by the heart’s deliberation have few officials and clear governance. Thus, in an age of principle, one seeks the unseen and unheard talents. In a perilous age, one seeks the visible and audible talents. Alas! Do rulers understand this?\n\nSelecting officials by ear and eye leads all to flatter and fawn for favor. Selecting officials by the heart’s deliberation leads all to be tranquil and upright, diligent in virtue. When officials are tranquil and upright, diligent in virtue, transformation occurs without words. When officials flatter and fawn for favor, even punishment does not deter them. Do rulers understand this?\n\n**On the Way of Ministers (Chapter Five)**\n\nWhen a state is about to prosper, the hundreds of officials in the court may be short or tall, ugly or beautiful, gentle or stern, right or wrong. Though their words and appearances may seem different, examining their aspirations and testing their hearts reveals all are devoted to the state. Thus, they admonish without resentment, accept demotion without shock, and debate to reach the mean without deviating from principle. Therefore, heaven does not err in its seasons, earth does not lack its benefits, people do not disrupt their affairs, spirits and gods offer aid, and barbarians submit in harmony. All things transform and nurture, and the Great Harmony is preserved.\n\nWhen a state is about to perish, the hundreds of officials in the court have fine appearances, harmonious complexions, elegant and gentle words, and refined movements. Though their appearances and words may seem joyful, examining their aspirations and testing their hearts reveals all are competing for position. Thus, they marvel at the strange, are shocked by the unusual, scheme with jealousy, and ultimately lose the Dao. Therefore, heaven sends disasters, the seasons reverse, earth produces monstrosities, people commit evil deeds, spirits and gods sow misfortune, and barbarians invade repeatedly. Chaos and calamity abound, and all things fail to transform.\n\nThose who do not waste resources, exhaust the people, or harm officials yet achieve success and establish governance, enriching the people and glorifying the ruler’s virtue—such are loyal and worthy ministers. Those who squander wealth, trouble the people, endanger officials, and hastily produce fleeting achievements to seek the ruler’s favor, heedless of future disasters for the state—such are treacherous ministers.\n\nIn an age of perfect governance, officials are well-chosen. In an age of no governance, the unworthy obtain office.\n\nZhulong Wen asked about serving a ruler. Kang Cangzi said: \"One who guards his reputation and serves others must be impartial in heart, harmonious in appearance, and upright in speech. Impartiality should not be exposed, harmony should not be mixed, and uprightness should not offend. The ancients were diligent in governance for the state; today, they are diligent in cultivating reputation for themselves. Those who govern for the state arrange affairs distinctly, act appropriately, and align with the greater whole. Those who cultivate reputation for themselves arrange affairs distinctly but become distant and disconnected, constrained by trivialities.\n\nThus, when the heart takes the Dao as its master, handling affairs finds its proper place. When the heart takes affairs as its master, handling things loses their proper place. Ministers in high positions who do not admonish, and in low positions who are not impartial, fail to fulfill their duties and enjoy their emoluments. The ruler does not show reverence, high ministers are not trusted, and low ministers are not united. In such a court, the talented are not necessarily loyal, and the loyal are not necessarily talented.\n\nMinisters need not worry about disloyalty but fear that their loyalty will not be trusted. They need not worry about distrust but fear that trust will not enable them to serve. The highest type of person, when their nature is realized, brings order to the world. The middling type, when their nature is realized, brings chaos to the world. The enlightened ruler employs the highest type, entrusting them with authority and allowing them to act freely. When employing the middling type, the ruler must set standards, assess their achievements, and apply rewards and punishments.\n\n**On the Way of the Worthy (Chapter Six)**\n\nThe worthy are frequently sought but rarely arrive, difficult to advance yet easy to retreat. It is not that they cherish their lives and refuse to die for the ruler’s affairs, but rather they fear that their loyalty will not be trusted.\n\nThose who know they possess talent and insight are outwardly respectful yet inwardly untroubled. Among the crowd, they are harmonious and upright without being overly familiar. When close, they are even more dignified; when distant, they depart without resentment. In poverty and distress, they accept fate with ease; in honor and success, they rectify themselves with the Dao.\n\nSome may observe their demeanor and deem them worthy, hear their voices and deem them worthy, yet when testing their spirit and assessing their duties, they fall short of expectations. When the worthy are employed, they enter and offer subtle counsel, exit and remain silent, diligently attend to their duties, and live frugally in seclusion. When not employed, they conceal themselves among the crowd, hide their insight from sight, and restrain their words. They eat their fill, walk at ease, cultivate their own virtue, and remain steadfast without resentment. The wise do not doubt their affairs, and the discerning do not doubt their persons.\n\nThose with insight tread perilous paths yet remain unshaken in countenance, speak humbly yet cannot be refuted in principle. The worthy do not call themselves worthy—their effectiveness lies in governance, their achievements in affairs.\n\nIn times of great peace, the highest scholars apply their insight, the middling scholars exhaust their endurance, and the petty exert their strength.\n\nThere was once a man of Qi named Pouzi, whose talents could have revitalized the state, whose conduct could have stood alone. He served his parents with filial piety, was reverent in his village, and adhered to principles. Living in poverty with nothing to support his parents, he practiced trust and righteousness while traveling for a long time. Few understood him, and some, taking advantage of the times, mocked and deceived him. Thus, he carried his staff and walked among the people.\n\nKang Cangzi said: \"I have heard that the perfect person forgets emotions, while the common people do not. Those who preserve emotions strive to teach and revere trust and righteousness. Yet now I do not know: is it better to be untrusted or trusted? To be trusted yet not seen as trustworthy, or to be diligent and admire righteousness? To practice righteousness yet not consider oneself righteous?\n\nThus, the trustworthy and righteous often face hardship and retreat. How can they attain honor? Only when the times favor teaching and principle do they rise.\"\n\nKang Cangzi bowed, adjusted his robe, looked up, and sighed, then sang:\n\n\"When the times are bright, trust and righteousness flourish;\nWhen the times are silent, trust and righteousness hide.\nBright or silent, flourishing or hiding—\nI rush about, yet none claim me.\nAlas! I know not whom to blame.\nTo act with true nature and meet no response—\nIs this not the way of the unrecognized?\"",

      "translated_text": "When the true and constant Way no longer prevails, this is called the loss of the Dao.

Talent lies in seeking with care; without care, nothing surpasses the Son of Heaven remaining tranquil, his great ministers illuminating punishments without sparing the noble, bestowing favor without excluding the lowly. Then worthy men will come of themselves, seeking to be employed. When worthy men are employed, within the Four Seas all eyes see clearly, all ears hear purely, and all hearts are at ease without oppression. Heaven accomplishes itself, Earth settles itself, the myriad things mature in harmony, and even ghosts and spirits cannot exert their numinous power. Thus it is said: worthiness and uprightness may be awaited, not sought.\n\nIf the Son of Heaven is diligent and enlightened, and his great ministers harmonious and principled in seeking scholars, then magnanimous, expansive, impartial, and steadfast talents will arrive. If the Son of Heaven is harsh and suspicious, and his great ministers restless and impatient in seeking scholars, then crooked-hearted, cunningly responsive, destructive, and perverse talents will arrive. If the Son of Heaven is doubtful and envious, and his great ministers artfully compliant in seeking scholars, then those with strange surnames, unusual names, sidelong flattery, and bizarre arts will arrive. If the Son of Heaven deems himself worthy, and his great ministers entrench themselves in seeking scholars, then those who chase after ornamentation, pursue reputation, and indulge in greed, impurity, and superficial splendor will arrive. If the Son of Heaven is indecisive, and his great ministers devious and obsequious in seeking scholars, then those who are inwardly loyal yet outwardly perverse, with poisonous dispositions and harmonious words, will arrive. Thus it is said: talent lies in seeking with care; without care, nothing suffices.\n\nIn ancient times, the Yellow Emperor obtained Changxian, Feng Hong, Guirong, and Qiu Shang; King Tang of Shang obtained Yi Yin; King Xuan of Zhou obtained Fu Shen; Duke Huan of Qi obtained Ning Qi—all because these rulers embodied the Dao, surpassed in benevolence, spread illustrious sagacity and martial prowess, pondered harmony and radiance, and were magnanimous, generous, and flourishing in uprightness. Thus, the multitude of worthies came of themselves, seeking to be employed—not obtained through meticulous selection.\n\nDuke Ji said, \"Master, you speak of worthy men not being sought yet arriving of themselves. Are there also those who are unworthy yet arrive of themselves without being sought?\"\nKang Cangzi replied, \"Those who are unworthy yet arrive of themselves without being sought are indeed many. When the world follows the Dao, worthy men arrive of themselves without being sought. When the world loses the Dao, the unworthy arrive of themselves without being sought. Rulers who embody the Dao are few; those who lose it are many. Worthy men in the world are few; the unworthy are many. Thus, those who are unworthy yet arrive of themselves without being sought are many.\"\n\nDuke Ji said, \"The worthy surely save the world, and talents can also save the world. Both save the world—how then do the worthy and the talented differ?\"\nKang Cangzi replied, \"Ah, how pressing is your question! When affairs are accomplished and tasks completed, to not be bound by titles or reputation, to withdraw with reverence, simplicity, and frugality—this is called worthiness. When affairs are accomplished and tasks completed, to take glory in emoluments, reputation, and full satisfaction—this is called talent.\n\nThe worthy can stabilize a state; talents can also govern a state. What is called 'stabilizing' is harmonious peace and non-action—people do not perceive their effort. What is called 'governing' is diligent leadership in affairs—people recognize their virtue. One worthy can lead a multitude of talents with ease; a multitude of talents, even measuring against one worthy, still fall short. Thus, the worthy and the talented dwell in separate realms: some reside in mountains and forests yet are clamorous; some live among the common folk yet are tranquil. Some are clamorous yet upright; some are tranquil yet perverse.\n\nGenerally, when observing their appearance: those whose demeanor is coarse and vulgar yet possess worthiness are one in ten thousand; those whose appearance is refined and elegant yet are petty men are nine in ten. One who does not test their words yet knows their refinement, does not demand their bearing yet examines their measure, does not gather their praise yet knows their goodness, does not follow their slander yet judges their truth—such a one may be called discerning.\"\n\n**Chapter Seven: Instructions on the Dao**\n\nMin Ziqian asked Confucius, \"How do the Dao and filial piety differ?\"\nConfucius replied, \"The Dao is the wondrous function of nature; filial piety is the supreme virtue of human relations. It encompasses and moves Heaven and Earth, engenders and nurtures the myriad things, subtly completes the ten thousand forms, and spreads forth the greatness of inherent nature and longevity. Its achievement is most substantial, yet it does not act as a storehouse for things, does not serve as an office for affairs, and does not claim credit for its accomplishments. Groping for it in seeking, seeing, and hearing, one cannot grasp its possession—thus it is named the Dao. Applied to humanity, it is named filial piety.\n\nFilial piety is the name for serving one’s parents well. In serving one’s parents well, reverence and compliance are fundamental. One’s intent in bearing this compliance is to follow their countenance without fail. Uttering a word or forming an intention, one does not dare forget one’s parents. Moving a hand or placing a foot, one does not dare forget one’s parents. In serving one’s lord, one does not dare be disloyal; with friends, one does not dare be untrustworthy; toward subordinates, one does not dare be disrespectful; in pursuing goodness, one does not dare be idle. Even when dwelling alone in a chamber, one does not dare relax one’s sincerity—this is called perfect filial piety.\n\nThus, utmost sincerity reaches the divine luminaries and shines throughout the Four Seas. There is response to every stimulus—this is the result of serving one’s parents well. In ancient times, Shun the Great was most filial. His stepmother deceived his father, who repeatedly resented and sought to harm him. Yet Shun’s heart grew only more reverent and cautious, without resentment. When they schemed to have him dredge a well, they buried him with earth. At that moment, Heaven’s blessing shook and stirred the divine luminaries, swiftly guiding him out through a side passage. He continued to serve his parents with even greater care. Thereby, his profound virtue flourished, and he became lord of the world—this was the result of serving one’s parents well.\n\nKing Wen, when he was Crown Prince, was most filial...\"",

Only when the times favor teaching and principle do they rise.\"\n\nKang Cangzi bowed, adjusted his robe, looked up, and sighed, then sang:\n\n\"When the times are bright, trust and righteousness flourish;\nWhen the times are silent, trust and righteousness hide.\nBright or silent, flourishing or hiding—\nI rush about, yet none claim me.\nAlas! I know not whom to blame.\nTo act with true nature and meet no response—\nIs this not the way of the unrecognized?\"",

      "translated_text": "At dawn and dusk, he would invariably arrive outside the bedchamber doors to inquire of the attendants, \"How is he today? Is he well?\" If they replied, \"He is well,\" the Crown Prince’s face would brighten with joy. If there was even the slightest discomfort, his countenance would fill with worry. When the morning and evening meals were presented, the Crown Prince would first examine their temperature, and only after confirming the dishes offered would he withdraw. When the attendants reported illness, the Crown Prince would don solemn robes and fast. The steward’s prepared meals he would inspect with reverence; the medicinal broths offered he would personally taste. If the food was good, the Crown Prince could eat; if the food was poor, he could not eat his fill—only when his father’s condition returned to normal would his own return to normal.\n\nWhen the lord later erred, he would gently admonish him with harmonious words. Even for the lord’s beloved, no matter how small the matter, he would treat it with utmost gravity. Thus, filial piety perfected his person, and the Dao harmonized the world. As the *Ya* says: *\"King Wen ascends and descends at the Lord’s side,\"* meaning that in King Wen’s stillness and action, advance and retreat, Heaven itself aided him. Thus, Zhou could not harm him, his life was extended in dreams, and the divination for his dynasty foretold thirty reigns and seven hundred years—this was the mandate of Heaven, the result of serving one’s parents well.\n\nMin Ziqian said, \"I have been fortunate to hear the Way of serving parents well. May I ask about the principle of teaching one’s children?\" Confucius replied, \"In all cases, the Three Kings taught their children with ritual and music. Music cultivates the inner self; ritual cultivates the outer. When ritual and music are cultivated together, virtue and bearing shine forth in one’s appearance. Thus, one becomes warmly respectful and civilized. If, as a subject, one would sacrifice one’s life for the ruler’s benefit, how much more should one benefit oneself to serve one’s ruler well? Therefore, they selected loyal, upright, steadfast, and incorruptible scholars as tutors, wishing them to understand the Dao of father and son, ruler and minister, elder and younger. Only after knowing how to be a son can one be a father; only after knowing how to be a minister can one be a ruler; only after knowing how to serve others can one employ others—this is the principle of the Three Kings in teaching their children.\"\n\nMin Ziqian withdrew and practiced this in his own household. For three years, no one could find fault in his words to his parents or brothers, his friends praised his trustworthiness, his village praised his benevolence, and his clan praised his fraternal duty. The reputation of his virtue and conduct spread throughout the world—this, too, was the result of serving one’s parents well.\n\nThe Crown Prince of Qi sat upon the Pure Terrace. Duke Zhuang, wearing a towering cap and stern expression, with a jade-encrusted sword at his left and pendants at his right—his left gleaming upon his right, his right upon his left—read without looking up. The Duke asked, \"Does Qi possess treasures?\" The Crown Prince replied, \"The ruler’s trustworthiness and the ministers’ loyalty, with the people upholding their superiors—these are Qi’s treasures.\" Duke Zhuang immediately unbuckled his sword and departed.\n\nAlas! A man may have biases and obstructions yet live his whole life without self-awareness. The worthy see them and forgive in silence; petty men, in their violent affection, speak excessively; relatives, in their tender envy, sow discord. How can one with biases and obstructions fail to know oneself?\n\nThus, the noble person examines himself, ever as though he has faults. He wears his robes and eats his food, knowing his faults yet unable to correct them—this the noble person finds shameful. When about to speak, if he knows he cannot act accordingly, the noble person seldom speaks. When reproaching the masses for their faults, does he first examine his own goodness? When reproaching the masses for their depravity, does he first examine his own uprightness?",

      "translated_text": "Alas! This is what is called \"returning to clarity.\" The son of Zhai Xi was most filial and cautious. Zhai Xi, pitying his son, often spoke to him recklessly. At dawn, Zhai Xi would depart, and by dusk, he would return, saying, \"Jia is dead!\" His son believed him, yet soon after, Jia was alive and well. Another evening, he said, \"Yi is about to harm me!\" His son lay in wait, ready to avenge him, yet no enmity appeared. Another evening, he said, \"Ding is ill!\" His son observed him, but Ding was truly well. Such instances were countless. Over the years, the son remained filial and cautious, yet his training and discipline grew ever more unreliable.\n\nThe people of his village and state loathed his reckless speech and plotted to kill him. Zhai Xi, hearing this, grew fearful and returned to tell his son. The son did not fully believe him, but soon after, Zhai Xi was murdered. He reflected: those who speak excessively are deemed careless, yet there are also those whose words are few and guarded but whose secrecy is lacking; those who are fickle are deemed unsteady, yet there are also those whose demeanor is composed but whose hearts are restless; those who are meddlesome are deemed petty, yet there are also those whose outward appearance is pure but whose inner selves are impure. Such examples are too numerous to record. Without thorough understanding, how can one discern them clearly?\n\nThere are times when one must not respond to affairs—those whose inner selves are tranquil yet whose outer selves are active, easily moved but difficult to still. There are times when one must not seek after affairs—those who inwardly reflect yet outwardly wait, finding joy only when the moment arrives. Thus, those whose outer selves are tranquil yet whose inner selves are active disturb their thoughts and harm their nature; those who rush about chasing profit exhaust their strength and damage their reputation.\n\nIn this world, some encounter affairs that do not align with their aspirations and declare, \"I have not met with the times.\" This is no different from bearing the guilt of a crimson neck, awaiting the moment of execution—how perilous! Those with vast talent and comprehensive understanding who have yet to be recognized and employed may rightly say, \"The times are not unclean; my fate has not yet aligned.\" Is this not correct?\n\nThose skilled in remonstrance strive to preserve the nature of others while pruning the emotions from which their conduct arises. Thus, mutual openness and respect flourish, and intimacy deepens. Those unskilled in remonstrance strive to attack the nature of others while remaining ignorant of the origins of their emotions. Thus, mutual suspicion and estrangement grow daily.\n\nWhat children dismiss, the elderly condemn; what delights the eyes, the mind finds repugnant. To firmly condemn the foolishness of the world is to acknowledge one’s own lack of worthiness; to firmly condemn the delusion of the world is to acknowledge one’s own lack of clarity. To condemn the foolishness of the masses while lacking worthiness is to invite ruin; to condemn the delusion of the masses while lacking clarity is to invite harm.\n\n**Agricultural Dao, Eighth Chapter**\n\nIf people abandon fundamentals to pursue trifles, their commands will not be unified. Without unified commands, they cannot defend nor wage war. If people abandon fundamentals to pursue trifles, their production will be meager. With meager production, they will lightly drift and migrate. Lightly drifting and migrating, the state will frequently face disasters, and all will harbor distant aspirations, no longer settling their hearts.\n\nIf people abandon fundamentals to pursue trifles, they will favor cunning. Favoring cunning, they will be deceitful. With deceit, they will manipulate laws and decrees, turning right into wrong and wrong into right. The way the ancient sage-kings governed the people was to prioritize agriculture. People farming is not merely for the benefits of the land but to honor the fulfillment of their aspirations. When people farm, they are simple; when simple, they are easily employed; when easily employed, the borders are secure; when secure, the ruler’s position is exalted.\n\nWhen people farm, they are steadfast; when steadfast, they have little selfishness; with little selfishness, public laws are established, and strength is abundant and profound. When people farm, their production is restored; with restored production, they are reluctant to scatter; when reluctant to scatter, they die where they dwell, without divided thoughts. When the world is of one mind, the governance of the Yellow Emperor and Qi nearly pales in comparison.\n\nThe way the ancient sage-kings flourished plowing and weaving was to regard them as the foundation of instruction. Thus, the Son of Heaven personally led the feudal lords to plow the sacred field, and the ministers and officers all had their tasks, encouraging people to honor the earth’s bounty. The queen and consorts led the palace women to weave silk in the suburban mulberry fields and public fields, encouraging the diligence of women’s work.\n\nMen do not weave yet are clothed; women do not plow yet are fed. Men and women exchange their labor, supporting one another’s livelihood—this was the system of the sage-kings. Thus, they revered the seasons, cherished the days, measured the harvest, and assessed the work. They did not rest unless old or ill. One person’s labor fed ten. At that time, earthworks were not initiated, nor were troops mobilized. Men did not leave to defend the borders, and women did not marry outside, so as not to hinder agriculture.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said: \"The rectification of the four seasons lies solely in the proper cultivation of the five grains.\" Those who cultivate the crops are the people; those who give life to them are the earth; those who nourish them are Heaven. Thus, the space for planting must accommodate the hoe, the space for weeding must accommodate the hand—this is the Dao of plowing. Farmers attack food, artisans attack tools, and merchants attack goods. If timely affairs are not completed and are disrupted by earthworks, this is called great misfortune.\n\nFor all crops, those planted early precede the season; those planted late miss the season. If cold and heat are untimely, crops suffer many disasters. Fifty-seven days after the winter solstice, *changsheng* begins, and thus plowing commences. The Dao of farming is to plant when life appears and harvest when death arrives. Heaven sends forth the seasons, earth produces wealth—they do not make appointments with people. When the year is bountiful, the earth is worshipped; when the year is barren, the earth is not blamed, nor are people’s timeliness lost.\n\nAct when the time arrives, and cease when the time passes. The strength of the old and weak can be fully employed. Those who do not know the seasons act before the time arrives, long for it after it has passed, or belittle it when it is present—these are the inferior in their undertakings.\n\nWeeding must be done in drought to make the earth fertile and the soil loose. Crops desire to sprout in fine soil and take root in firm earth. Be cautious with seeds: do not sow them too densely nor too sparsely. The earth should not be insufficient nor excessive. Furrows should be deep and straight; fields should be fertile and level. The lower part receives shade, the upper part receives sunlight—then growth flourishes.\n\nWhen seedlings are in rows, they grow tall and strong. When the weak and strong do not harm one another, they grow swiftly and uniformly. Widen the rows, keep the centers open, and allow cool breezes to circulate—then the harvest will be abundant and the work fruitful. When observing the crops from afar, they appear lush, but upon approaching, they are sparse—this is the earth’s theft. If not removed, they become overgrown; if removed, the earth is depleted—this is the harm of the task.\n\nWhen seedlings are weak, they should grow alone; when they are tall, they should not be crowded.",

      "translated_text": "When crops wish to grow together, let the mature ones dwell in harmony; when they wish to support one another, form groups of three as a clan—then the harvest will yield abundant grain. The peril of seedlings lies not in their shared birth, but in their shared death. Thus, the early-sprouting ones produce fine rice, while the late-sprouting become chaff. Therefore, in weeding, nurture the elder and remove the younger. For fertile soil, do not allow overcrowding; for barren soil, do not permit solitary growth. Overcrowding in fertile soil yields much chaff; solitary growth in barren soil leads to many deaths. Those who do not understand weeding remove the elder and preserve the younger, failing to harvest grain while gathering only chaff. When upper and lower are unsettled, the crops die in great numbers.\n\nTimely millet grows tall with large ears, its grains round and husks thin, its rice sweet and fragrant, easy to hull and strengthening to eat. Untimely millet bears deep awns and slender stalks, its ears sharp and filled with chaff, its grains green and withered. Timely millet has long, awnless ears, its grains plump and husks few. Untimely millet grows thick stems, flowering stalks, and short, lush ears. Timely rice has sturdy stalks and long ears like a horse’s tail. Untimely rice has slender stalks that do not flourish, thick husks, and many deaths. Timely hemp has sparse nodes and a bright hue, its fibers strong and roots small. Untimely hemp grows dense branches, short stalks, coarse nodes, and worm-eaten leaves. Timely beans have long stalks and short stems, their pods arranged in pairs of seven as a clan, with many branches, numerous nodes, lush leaves, and heavy, nourishing beans. Untimely beans grow long and vine-like, with floating leaves, weak stems, sparse nodes, and small pods. Timely wheat grows tall with black necks, its rows arranged in pairs of seven, its glumes thin and color protective, strengthening those who eat it, making them robust. Untimely wheat swells with disease, its seedlings weak and ears sparse.\n\nThus, timely crops are bountiful, while untimely ones are meager. All grains, when cultivated at their proper time, nourish those who eat them, fortifying the four limbs, sharpening hearing and sight, preventing malign qi from entering the body, and averting misfortune. How excellent were Confucius’ words: “In winter, a full stomach warms the body; in summer, it cools it. When warmth and coolness are seasonally appropriate, people suffer no illness.” When people suffer no illness, epidemics do not spread, and all may fulfill their natural lifespan. Thus it is said: “Grain is the heaven of man.” Therefore, enlightened rulers prioritize agriculture. A ruler who does not prioritize agriculture abandons the people. And a ruler who abandons the people—what kingdom can he govern?\n\n*Military Strategy, Chapter Nine*",

      "translated_text": "Duke Jing of Qin sought to establish military supremacy across the realm. He dispatched Minister Bao Rong with a solemn charge, and awaited Kang Cangzi in twelve districts of fertile land. Pressed by urgency, Kang Cangzi arrived from Rongquan and was lodged in the upper guesthouse. For three days, the Duke found no opportunity to consult him. Descending from his mat, he faced north, prostrated himself, and struck his jade tablet to the ground, saying: \"Does Heaven truly have no intention to succor the orphaned?\"\n\nKang Cangzi’s gaze softened as he replied: \"I took Your Lordship to be asking of extraordinary matters—why then do you trouble yourself with such trivialities? Whether one wields the axe or thrusts the blade, all follows desire to attain correctness. What more could be desired?\"\n\nThe Duke bowed once, then twice, straightened his embroidered robe, adjusted his jade tablet, lowered his head, and sat, saying: \"It is truly as Heaven commands.\"\n\nKang Cangzi looked up at the rafters and sighed, then composed his expression and said: \"I wish to speak of the origins of warfare, which arose together with the first men. Warfare is the manifestation of human might. Since human might is endowed by Heaven, the roots of warfare extend to the highest realms. There has never been a moment when it was not employed. From noble to base, elder to youth, wise to foolish—all alike perceive the signs of war within their hearts. Harboring resentment before it erupts is war. Glowering with fierce eyes and changing countenance is war. Harsh words and violent gestures are war. Extravagant quarrels and armed conflict are war. These four are but disputes of great and small. Even before Chiyou’s time, men already brandished timber to fight. The Yellow Emperor employed water and fire. Gonggong stirred rebellion. The Five Emperors contended with one another.\"",

When warmth and coolness are seasonally appropriate, people suffer no illness.” When people suffer no illness, epidemics do not spread, and all may fulfill their natural lifespan. Thus it is said: “Grain is the heaven of man.” Therefore, enlightened rulers prioritize agriculture. A ruler who does not prioritize agriculture abandons the people. And a ruler who abandons the people—what kingdom can he govern?\n\n*Military Strategy, Chapter Nine*",

      "translated_text": "When one rises and another falls, the victorious takes command. Yet there are those who die from swallowing medicine—would it be right to ban all physicians in the world? There are those who drown while boarding a boat—would it be right to ban all ships? There are those who lose their states through warfare—would it be right to ban all arms? The abolition of arms is as impossible as the abolition of water and fire. When well employed, they bring fortune; when misused, they bring disaster. Thus, anger and punishment cannot be abolished within a household, nor can penal laws be abolished within a state, nor can armed campaigns be abolished under Heaven. The sage-kings of antiquity waged righteous wars but never sought to abolish warfare. When arms are truly righteous, they punish tyrannical rulers and rescue the suffering—people rejoice as a filial son beholds his loving parent, or as a starving man encounters fine food. They rush forward with cries, swift as a powerful crossbow loosing its bolt into a deep valley. Victory or defeat need not be sought elsewhere, for it returns to human nature. All people desire life and hate death, desire honor and hate disgrace. When the Way of life and death, honor and disgrace is unified, the soldiers of the Three Armies may be made of one mind.\n\nAn army desires numbers, but even more, it desires unity of heart. When the Three Armies are of one mind, commands may be issued without fear of resistance. The supreme army values its commands above all. Where its commands are strong, its enemies are weak; where its commands are trusted, its enemies yield. Victory secured here is victory secured there. If this is truly so, what enemy could prevail?\n\nWhen enemies advance, they do so in pursuit of gain. If, upon arriving, they find only death, and flight becomes their advantage, then all enemies will see flight as advantageous—and blades will never meet. This is the supreme army.\n\nCruelty, oppression, deceit, and righteous principle stand in opposition. Their forces cannot both prevail; they cannot coexist. Thus, when a righteous army enters enemy territory, the people know where to seek refuge. When it reaches the outskirts of cities and towns, it does not trample crops, does not desecrate graves, does not plunder stores, does not burn homes. Captives are returned unharmed, promises are kept, and the spoils of war are used to demonstrate good and evil, to show defiance and compliance. If, despite this, there remain those who stubbornly resist, act with brutality, or defy authority, then the use of force is justified.\n\nFirst, a proclamation is issued: \"Our army comes to avenge the wronged and align with the Dao of Heaven. When we conquer a state, we do not massacre its people but punish only the guilty.\" Then, the virtuous and worthy are selected and honored, the orphaned and infirm are sought out and cared for, the treasuries are opened and their wealth distributed, the granaries are emptied and their grain given away. Nothing is kept for private gain, and courtesy is extended to all. If a man could revive the dead, the world would rush to serve him—how much more so when a righteous army revives not one but many? Who would not rejoice? Thus, when a righteous army arrives, the people of neighboring states flock to it like flowing water, and the people of the conquered state look upon it as their parents. The farther it marches, the more people it gains.\n\nBefore the words were finished, the lord rose, bowed deeply, and said, \"I have heard your teachings and feel my qi fill the universe. My will now knows its direction, and my heart is ever more reverent.\" Then he stepped forward, raised a cup in toast to honor Kang Cangzi, bowed to take the foremost place among his disciples, and arranged his seat with solemnity in the purification chamber. For over a month, he observed the cycles of the heavens, passing through the Celestial Gate, practicing the Dao even in broad daylight, and conducting himself with the rites of a disciple.
