One fascicle. Originally attributed to Commander Xin Hanchen of the Thunderous Might Officials.\n\n**Source:** *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongzhen* Section, *Weiyi* Category.\n\n---\n\n**The Jade Emperor’s Absolution and Bestowal of Blessings Precious Repentance Sutra**\n*Composed by Commander Xin Hanchen of the Thunderous Might Officials*\n\nWe, the registered Daoist officials, reverently kindle true incense and sincerely memorialize:\nTo the Scriptural Teaching Master, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of Original Commencement;\nTo the Jade Emperor, the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy;\nTo the Heavenly Worthy Who Disseminates the Sacred Teachings and Descends into Birth;\nTo the Jade Sovereign of the Ten Thousand Heavens, the August Thearch;\nTo the Sacred Father, the Heavenly Worthy of the King of Radiant Splendor and Wondrous Joy;\nTo the Sacred Mother, the August Lady of Precious Moonlight;\nTo the boundless true sages who attend the imperial audience and all the perfected immortals—\n\nWe humbly recall:\nIn the secluded abodes of the Mysterious Park, the Primordial One ascends the throne of radiant light;\nManifesting incarnations to assemble, the Jade Emperor expounds the sutra of his former conduct.\n\nIn times past, there was the King of Wondrous Joy, named Pure Virtue, and his queen, Precious Moonlight. Anxious over the lack of an heir, they commanded the Daoist clergy to offer prayers throughout the land. Half a year passed, yet their resolve never wavered. Moved by their devotion, the Supreme Dao Lord and the host of perfected beings arrived in a five-colored chariot, bearing an infant whose pores emitted light, transfiguring the palace halls. At the queen’s earnest entreaty, they bestowed the child as heir. Born with divine spirit, he grew in benevolence. The people sang of his Dao, and his transformative influence permeated all without effort. Having entrusted the kingdom to his ministers, he entered the mountains to cultivate the supreme Dao, practicing alchemy to heal the sick and aiding the state to save the people. First attaining the rank of Golden Immortal, he later ascended to become the Jade Emperor—a marvel unheard of in former times, beyond all praise.\n\nWe, having received boundless grace across kalpas and been transformed over countless lives, lament our foolish and deluded nature, which has accumulated grievous transgressions. How dare we not confess and repent, beseeching original absolution? Thus, in reverence to the sacred canons, we exert ourselves in remorseful reflection, praying to sever obstructions and dissolve transgressions, hoping to avert calamities and accumulate blessings. May our hearts’ desires be fulfilled, and may we realize sagehood and attain perfection.\n\nAs this repentance ritual is proclaimed, we first invoke the descent of the true immortals, humbly entreating their compassion, that we may attain spiritual communion.\n\nWe pray that the world may become like lapis lazuli, that the immortals may ride the nine-jeweled, golden-hued wheels converging in splendor, their ten-ornamented feathered canopies soaring aloft. May the divine winds play music, harmonizing with treasures, while flowers form canopies to cover all; may phoenixes sing and simurghs cry, dragons dance and qilins frolic, all wheeling and whirling at the celestial zenith. May they descend upon the mortal realm, bringing joy and celebration to gods and humans alike, and may our sins and faults be eradicated. Should our prayers be answered, what greater fortune could there be?\n\nWe, along with our disciples, prostrate ourselves in awe, gazing toward the celestial majesty, awaiting your descent with utmost reverence. Trembling with sincerity, we bow our heads to the ground, fixing our thoughts upon your august countenance, trusting in your radiant grace. In accordance with the scriptures, we recite the gāthā spoken by the Lord of the Highest Void and Luminous Heaven, to offer our praise:\n\n*Golden Portal’s Mysterious Vault Lord,*\n*Exalted Jade Emperor Supreme.*\n*Wondrous form crowns all heavens,*\n*Compassionate light illumines the Three Realms.*\n*True sage, teacher of the wondrous Dao,*\n*On whom gods and humans rely.*\n*The Great Vehicle’s dharma words descend,*\n*The True One points the way to the lost.*\n*Virtue vast as empty space,*\n*Praise and extolment never end.*\n\nWe, the registered Daoist officials, along with the disciples of the Great Dao, reverently bow again and memorialize the Three Clarities, the August Sages, the Jade Emperor the Supreme, the Imperial Father and Imperial Mother, the Most Sacred and Most Perfected, the Ten Directions and Three Realms, and all true numina.\n\nWe have heard that the sagely virtue is boundless, beyond all record or praise; the feelings of mortals, when moved, should exhaust all laudation. His wondrous vision and wondrous knowledge are peerless; his great compassion and great mercy inspire pity and mercy. Thus, following the scriptures, we recount his titles, hoping to align our thoughts with devotion.\n\nTen mighty names scarcely suffice to praise his ineffable title; seventeen lights, though exhaustive, cannot encompass his infinite radiance. Vast as \"Heaven,\" yet Heaven cannot compare; ultimate as \"Dao,\" yet all Dao emanates from him. Even the golden mouth could not exhaust his glory—how could the dusty world ever know it? We merely gather words from the scriptures to extol his sagely virtue.\n\nWe pray that uttering one good word may give rise to all virtues in the heart; that praising ten names may dissolve all sins recorded in the ledgers. May kindness, harmony, and humility grow ever greater; may wisdom and eloquence gradually attain perfection. Together with all sentient beings, may we realize the supreme Dao.\n\nWe, along with our disciples, prostrate ourselves in utmost sincerity, universally dedicating this to our departed ancestors, living kin, all beings in the dusty world, and the souls lost in the long night. With reverence, we take refuge and bow in faith.\n\nWe, with wholehearted devotion, prostrate ourselves and pay homage to the Jade Emperor, the Great Heavenly Worthy, the August Thearch of the Mysterious Vault.\n\nWe, with wholehearted devotion, prostrate ourselves and pay homage to the Jade Emperor, the Great Heavenly Worthy, the August Thearch of the Mysterious Vault, who wields the six spiritual powers, with all joining in praise.\n\n*(Each line of the celestial titles below is followed by the assembly’s response of \"Heavenly Worthy\" and a bow.)*\n\nWe, with wholehearted devotion, prostrate ourselves and pay homage to the One who radiates great light in the White Jade Capital.\n\nWithin the Golden Portal, the Seven-Treasure Mysterious Park.\nIn the Hall of Great Illumination, upon the Throne of Light.\nMost exalted among the sacred, purest above all.\nBody adorned with precious radiance, form wondrous and fair.\nSwift in transformation, keen in wisdom; ever benevolent in growth.\nKind, harmonious, and humble; having achieved merit, transcending the world.\nRenouncing love to study the Dao, practicing alchemy to heal the sick.\nDelivering sentient beings, widely bestowing expedient means.\nBroadly proclaiming the true transformation, spreading divine works.\nAiding the state and saving the people, practicing forbearance for their sake.\nRadiating great light, manifesting rare and wondrous signs.\nLord of the vault of heaven, sovereign of the kalpas.\nWondrous vision, wondrous knowledge, without peer or equal.\nProfoundly still, truly pure, beyond annihilation or permanence.\nMost sacred, most numinous, wielder of great spiritual powers.\nTreasure-house of light, great and mighty one.\n\nOpening the transformation of humans and heavens, teaching the Dao without end.\nBoundless compassion, boundless mercy, turning the Wheel of Dharma with radiant flow.\nMysterious principles, profound and abstruse, existing before the vast kalpas began.\nGoverning transformation through past and present, named the Supreme Vehicle.\nRare and wondrous in majesty and virtue, immeasurable in merit.\nPure and spontaneous, divine and unshakable.\nMighty and vast in numinous power, fame spreading everywhere.\nNo darkness left unillumined, divinely wondrous and towering.\nTransforming through countless kalpas, possessing great spiritual powers.\nManifesting in myriad forms, responding and appearing wherever needed.\nBenefiting and delivering all beings, universally bestowing the teachings.\nAwakening those who come after, with divine wisdom wondrously penetrating.\nBeyond measure—\nGreat Light of Spiritual Power,\nGreat Light of Compassion,\nGreat Light of Joyful Giving,\nGreat Light of Forbearance,\nGreat Light of Equality,\nGreat Light of Gentleness,\nGreat Light of Freedom,\nGreat Light of Benefit,\nGreat Light of Fulfillment,\nGreat Light of Wisdom,\nGreat Light of Auspiciousness,\nGreat Light of Liberation,\nGreat Light of Refuge,\nGreat Light of Merit,\nGreat Light of Perfection,\nGreat Light of Unobstruction,\nInvincible Light.\n\nTrue Elder of the Vault of Heaven, wondrously perfect and pure.\nWisdom and eloquence, the Most Revered of the Supreme Dao.\nTeacher of the Three Realms, Primordial Ancestor.\nUnsurpassed Holy Lord, Compassionate Father of the Four Kinds of Birth.\nExalted Heavenly Saint, Great Being of Mercy.\nTen Titles fulfilled, myriad virtues embodied.\nDelivering countless beings, rescuing from the suffering of birth and death.\n\nWith devoted hearts, we prostrate and offer homage to the Most High and Boundless Heaven, the Wondrous Realm of Mysterious Reality, the Vast and Resplendent Purple-Golden Palace, the Grand Jade Clarity Palace of the Great Subtlety.\nThe Limitless and Supreme Saint, vast and luminous.\nStill and boundless, without origin, the Mysterious Model encompassing the ten directions.\nThe Profoundly Still and Eternally Constant Dao, the Vast and Mighty Spiritual Power.\nThe August Jade Emperor, the Supreme Sovereign of the Lofty Vault of Heaven.\n\nWe, the registered officials and disciples of the Great Dao, led by so-and-so, reverently bow and humbly submit this memorial to the Three Pure Ones of the Three Realms, the August Jade Emperor of the Vast Heaven, the Divine Father and Divine Mother, the Most Sacred and Most True, the Lords of the Three Realms and the Ten Directions, and all true sovereigns.\n\nWe have heard that to embody the Dao and attain truth arises from few transgressions and errors;\nwhile to pass from life into death stems from missteps in conduct.\n\nWhen the nature is once indulged, transgressions accumulate more heavily than mountains and hills; when the heart once repents, sins dissolve and disperse like ice and snow. Thus, the luminous teachings of the fundamental scriptures and precepts make clear the karmic causes of sin and blessing—how dare we fail to awaken a heart of repentance, only to persist in indulging our nature? With utmost sincerity and earnestness, we humbly beseech Your sacred compassion. May the ten evils and five rebellions be dissolved through our prostrations; may the three karmas and six senses be cleansed through our praises. We dare not conceal or hide anything, but confess all fully and with utmost effort. May we be bathed in Your mercy, and may You grant us special pardon. We pray that the myriad sins of a thousand offenses vanish in an instant; that the faults accumulated over many lives and kalpas be extinguished before the Dao. May we, in all future existences, become beings without transgression, uniting with the Dao and truth, never far from the sages.\n\nMay this extend to our nine generations of ancestors and seven lineages, universally embracing the six paths and three realms of suffering, all sentient beings, and the boundless lower realms—may all rely on the great virtue of the August Jade Emperor to dissolve the deep karmic debts of vast kalpas. May we attain few transgressions and few errors, perfecting goodness and beauty in all things.\n\nWe, your humble servants and disciples, led by so-and-so, offer our most earnest prayers. Together with our departed ancestors, living kin, all beings of the dusty world, and the lost souls of the long night, we prostrate ourselves in utmost devotion, taking refuge and offering reverence.\n\nWith devoted hearts, we bow in homage to the August Jade Emperor, the Supreme Sovereign of the Lofty Vault of Heaven.\n\nWith devoted hearts, we bow in homage, praying that each may clearly understand the karmic causes of sin and blessing.\n\nAfter each invocation of the August Jade Emperor, the Supreme Sovereign of the Lofty Vault of Heaven, the assembly responds with the sacred title and bows once.\n\nMay all evil karma be utterly dissolved.\nMay the five rebellions and ten evils be utterly dissolved.\nMay all wicked karma be utterly dissolved.\nMay those who believe in and turn toward this scripture be freed from evil.\nMay the boundless sacred teachings continuously deliver and uplift.\nMay the special grace of the exalted sages liberate us from hell.\nMay the dust-like evil karma dissolve as the heart wills.\nMay the sins of vast kalpas past be dissolved.\nMay the sins of indulging the nature of ignorance be dissolved.\nMay the sins of pervasive defilement by the six senses be dissolved.\nMay the sins of entanglement by the three karmas be dissolved.\nMay the sins of reckless indulgence be dissolved.\nMay the sins of never having awakened be dissolved.\nMay the sins accumulated over days and months be dissolved.\nMay the sins of turning from the Dao and violating truth be dissolved.\nMay the sins of following evil and abandoning right be dissolved.\nMay the sins of every thought and intention be dissolved.\nMay the sins of disobeying father and mother be dissolved.\nMay the sins of disrespecting the Three Treasures be dissolved.\nMay the sins of killing and stealing be dissolved.\nMay the sins of sexual misconduct and false speech be dissolved.\nMay the sins of cruelty and violence be dissolved.\nMay the sins of lacking reverence be dissolved.\nMay the sins of slanderous speech be dissolved.\nMay the sins of defiling touch with impure hands be dissolved.\nMay the sins of reciting scriptures with impure mouths be dissolved.\nMay the sins of discussing worldly matters be dissolved.\nMay the sins of frivolous laughter and play be dissolved.\nMay the sins in hell be dissolved.\nMay the sins among hungry ghosts be dissolved.\nMay the sins among animals be dissolved.\nMay the sins in remote borderlands and foreign realms be dissolved.\n\nWith devoted hearts, we bow in homage to the Supreme Heaven of the Peerless and Most High.\n\nThe wondrous realm of Mysterious Truth,\nThe boundless Purple Gold Vault.\nThe Great Tenuity Jade Clarity Palace,\nThe Limitless and Most Supreme Sage.\nVast and luminous,\nStill and boundless, without origin.\nThe Mysterious Model encompassing the ten directions,\nThe Profoundly Still and Eternally Constant Dao.\nThe Vast and Mighty Spiritual Power,\nThe August Jade Emperor, the Supreme Sovereign of the Lofty Vault of Heaven.\n\nWe, the registered officials and disciples of the Great Dao, led by so-and-so, reverently bow and humbly submit this memorial to the Three Pure Ones of the Three Realms, the August Jade Emperor of the Vast Heaven, the Divine Father and Divine Mother, the Most Sacred and Most True, the Lords of the Three Realms and the Ten Directions, and all true sovereigns.\n\nWe have heard that when obstructions remain unsevered, they cause blockage and delusion; when even one hindrance is removed, clarity and understanding arise.\n\nWhen the dark haze disperses, the sun regains its clarity; when floating clouds scatter, the heavens shine with radiance. If not swept away, how can one avoid persistent obscuration? The heart has yet to merge with the sun and moon, so hindrances must be cleared like clouds and mist.\n\nWe look up to the Primordial Sage’s compassion and proclaim the wondrous Dharma of severing obstructions, that all dust may cease to arise and the true realm reveal itself. Yet how can deluded ordinary beings, failing to cultivate according to the Dharma, avoid following emotions and chasing after phenomena? How can they settle their thoughts and concentrate their spirit?\n\nExternal demons disturb their supreme Dao, corrupt their spiritual roots, and steal their most precious treasure. Entangled in worldly nets, they sink into the common stream. Ten thousand demons assail them, and their singular truth is lost. Without the virtue of refinement and transformation, how can they achieve the merit of severing hindrances?\n\nFollowing the wondrous scriptures in repentance, we seek to sweep away all obstructions. Thus, we humbly implore and earnestly beseech: may you bestow the sword of wisdom to sever and extinguish all afflictive hindrances. Sweep away the floating veils, that the radiance of the sun of wisdom may shine; brush aside the dust of toil, that the pearl of the heart may gleam with purity.\n\nMay our mortal forms be purified, the fruit of the Dao perfected, and both the hidden and manifest realms together recognize the singular luminous nature. May we forever escape transmigration and eternally attain freedom.\n\nWe, your disciples, led by so-and-so, prostrate ourselves in utmost devotion, reverently bowing and submitting this prayer for all—our departed ancestors, living kin, all beings of the dusty world, and the wandering souls of the long night.\n\nWith single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the August Jade Emperor, the Supreme Sovereign of the Lofty Vault of Heaven.\n\nWith single-minded devotion, we bow in homage, each reciting the sacred title of the Heavenly Worthy and prostrating once, praying:\nMay no doubts arise,\nMay no greed or anger arise,\nMay no lust arise,\nMay no jealousy arise,\nMay no killing arise,\nMay no worldly attachments arise,\nMay no worldly thoughts arise,\nMay no dullness or filth arise,\nMay no attachment to sounds or forms arise,\nMay no right or wrong arise,\nMay no clinging to love arise,\nMay no discrimination arise,\nMay no arrogance arise,\nMay no attachment arise,\nMay thoughts be settled and the mind clear,\nMay the ten thousand spirits be subdued,\nMay the heart be as empty as space,\nMay inner and outer purity prevail,\nMay the body attain purity,\nMay all calamities be transcended,\nMay we behold the compassionate countenance,\nMay all be sheltered and delivered,\nMay all hear the wondrous Dharma,\nMay we personally make offerings,\nMay we forever escape transmigration,\nMay evil roots be severed,\nMay our names be recorded in the Mysterious Capital,\nMay all thoughts cease,\nMay the ten thousand conditions instantly still,\nMay delusions be cast aside,\nMay we uphold this scripture,\nMay nothing be excluded,\nMay nothing be rejected,\nMay external demons not disturb,\nMay the true source not be lost,\nMay the spiritual root not be corrupted,\nMay we not sink into the common stream,\nMay we not fall into worldly nets,\nMay the ten thousand demons not assail,\nMay we hear the true Dharma,\nMay habitual tendencies be relinquished,\nMay we cultivate all wondrous practices,\nMay we attain the gates of liberation,\nMay we share in pure faith,\nMay we share in pure understanding,\nMay we share in pure mindfulness,\nMay we share in pure conduct,\nMay we share in pure embodiment,\nMay we share in pure heart,\nMay we share in pure intention,\nMay we share in pure fruition,\nMay we share in pure retribution,\nMay we share in great compassion,\nMay we share in great mercy,\nMay we uphold the precepts with single-mindedness,\nMay we meditate deeply on the great Dao,\nMay we protect the true source,\nMay we honor and serve our parents,\nMay we reverently respect the Three Treasures,\nMay we exhaust loyalty to our sovereign,\nMay we refrain from killing or stealing,\nMay we refrain from lust or jealousy,\nMay we refrain from anger or hatred,\nMay we refrain from arrogance or deceit.\n\nWith single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the Supreme Heaven of Grand Network, the Wondrous Existence of the Mysterious True Realm, the Vast and Luminous Purple Gold Portal, the Grand Tenuity Jade Purity Palace, the Boundless and Supreme Sage. Vast and luminous, still and boundless, without origin. The Mysterious Model encompassing the ten directions, the Profoundly Still and Eternally Constant Dao. The Vast and Mighty Spiritual Power, the August Jade Emperor, the Supreme Sovereign of the Lofty Vault of Heaven.\n\n*Recitation:*\nThe August Jade Emperor’s cultivation flourished in Fragrant Grove,\nRadiating seventeenfold divine light.\nTo teach beings and remove obstructions,\nThe Dharma gate of True Oneness is widely proclaimed.\n\n*Response:* The inconceivable merits are boundless.\n\nWe, the registered officials and disciples of the Great Dao, led by so-and-so, reverently bow and humbly submit this memorial to the Three Pure Ones of the Three Realms, the August Jade Emperor of the Vast Heaven, the Divine Father and Divine Mother, the Most Sacred and Most True, the True Sovereigns of Heaven, Earth, Water, and Yang, and the Illuminated Lords of the Ten Directions.\n\nWe have heard that the formless and nameless alone stand supreme as the Dao; those with form and appearance cannot escape calamity. Even heaven and earth have their periods of closure and end, the sun and moon their eclipses. How much more so for humankind, each nurturing a mortal body? Unable to transcend fate or rise above conditions, we remain subject to the stars and bound to destiny. The thinness of predestined fortune, the weight of past karma—when dwellings turn adverse and times grow inauspicious, how can we avoid calamity? How can we escape misfortune?\n\nGreat disasters—floods, fires, bandits, and thieves—may escalate into illness, exile, the six extremes, the five declines, the seven harms, the eight difficulties, the three calamities, the four malevolent forces, the nine adversities, and the ten entanglements. When affliction befalls a nation, the nation cannot be at peace; when it strikes a year, the harvest cannot be bountiful. War, famine, displacement—having followed the teachings, we now repent and pray to avert these disasters.\n\nMay all be sheltered and delivered, all calamities dispelled. May predestined fate be reversed and past karma dissolved; may baleful stars retreat and adverse destinies be pacified. For the individual, residual misfortune may be quelled and crises averted; for the myriad beings, karmic retribution may be escaped and great disasters avoided. May we dwell securely in the dusty world, our actions ever meeting with fortune; may we reach the shore of the Dao, untouched by calamity. May we enjoy robust health, all beings live in peace, and heaven and earth endure forever.\n\nWe, your disciples, led by so-and-so, prostrate ourselves in utmost devotion, reverently bowing and submitting this prayer for all—our departed ancestors, living kin, all beings of the dusty world, and the wandering souls of the long night.\n\nWe, your disciples, with wholehearted devotion prostrate ourselves in reverence, bowing to the Jade Emperor, Great Heavenly Honored One, Mysterious Lofty High Sovereign. With each invocation of the sacred title of the Heavenly Honored One that follows, we bow once more in homage.\n\nMay all suffering and affliction be universally healed and liberation attained;\nMay mountain spirits guard and fierce beasts retreat of their own accord;\nMay winds and waves instantly subside and safe passage to the shore be granted;\nMay all evil bandits scatter and disperse;\nMay grievances be redressed and immediate release from bondage achieved;\nMay all malevolent spirits keep their distance and natural peace prevail;\nMay no calamity or misfortune draw near;\nMay all grave illnesses swiftly be cured;\nMay all malevolent ghosts and spirits vanish entirely;\nMay curses, hexes, and poisons dissolve of themselves;\nMay we reach the shore of the Dao untouched by calamity;\nMay life be preserved, disasters averted, and all inauspicious omens swept away;\nMay all demonic forces be naturally eradicated;\nMay the calamities of war and armed conflict be dispelled;\nMay the scourge of pestilence and plague be dispelled;\nMay the disasters of flood, drought, and locusts be dispelled;\nMay the misfortunes of famine and dearth be dispelled;\nMay the afflictions of all manner of malignant diseases be dispelled;\nMay the torments of scabies, leprosy, abscesses, and ulcers be dispelled;\nMay the sorrows of grief, sorrow, and distress be dispelled;\nMay the harms inflicted by wanton violence be dispelled;\nMay the miseries of imprisonment and shackles be dispelled;\nMay the tragedies of untimely and self-inflicted death be dispelled;\nMay the ravages of poison and toxins be dispelled;\nMay the dangers of tigers, wolves, insects, and serpents be dispelled;\nMay the entanglements of karmic debts be dispelled;\nMay the perils of encountering evil persons be dispelled;\nMay the horrors of slaughter and dismemberment be dispelled;\nMay the terrors of falling from cliffs be dispelled;\nMay the harms of malevolent spirits be dispelled;\nMay the devastations of water and fire be dispelled;\nMay the slaughter of warfare be dispelled;\nMay the tragedy of premature death be dispelled.\n\nWe, your disciples, with wholehearted devotion prostrate ourselves in reverence, bowing to the Supreme Peerless Heaven of the Great Ultimate. In the wondrous realm of Mysterious Reality, the distant Purple Gold Palace stands; the Jade Pure Palace of the Great Tenuity, where the Limitless and Supreme Sage dwells. Vast and luminous, its radiance shines; silent and boundless, it knows no origin. Its mysterious pattern encompasses the ten directions; its serene stillness is the true and constant Dao. Vast and unfathomable, its great spiritual power—Jade Emperor, Great Heavenly Honored One, Mysterious Lofty High Sovereign.\n\nWe, your registered officials and disciples, led by so-and-so, with utmost reverence and care, humbly present this memorial to the Three Pure Ones, the Most Supreme, the Jade Emperor, the Divine Father and Mother, the Most Sacred and True, the deities of Heaven, Earth, Water, and Yang, and all true numina.\n\nWe, your disciples, have heard that only when the power of virtue is lofty does the convergence of blessed affinity arise; only when wholesome thoughts reach maturity do auspicious signs appear. Without the witness of heaven and humanity, only the immortals’ disciples may inherit this truth. Yet we, having failed to accumulate the practices of true cultivation and long lacking a heart inclined toward the Dao, dare not refrain from supplication to seek your gracious bestowal. According to the wondrous sutras, recitation enables attainment; having already pledged devotion, we have begun to learn and recite. In the dual paths of sin and fortune, sin removed ensures fortune’s bestowal; in the two principles of calamity and auspiciousness, calamity dispelled ensures blessings stored. Having eradicated past sins, we are certain that future disasters will be averted. We trust in your compassion and mercy, which will surely heed our earnest pleas. Daring to express our reverent homage, we humbly await the descent of your exorcistic grace. With incense offered in earnest entreaty, we gaze toward your imperial benevolence.\n\nWe humbly pray that your virtue, profound and vast, and your grace, boundless and expansive, may widely bestow propitious winds to shelter all things, and benevolent moisture to bless every household with joy. May the Five Fortunes be conferred, bringing universal delight to all people; may the Hundred Auspices arrive, ensuring the flourishing of descendants. May the world ascend to the realm of benevolence and longevity, and may enduring blessings be enjoyed without end. As if dwelling beyond the dust, may we differ not from those within the mysterious. We, your disciples, led by so-and-so, prostrate ourselves in utmost devotion, reverently bowing and submitting this prayer for all—our departed ancestors, living kin, all beings of the dusty world, and the wandering souls of the long night.\n\nWe, your disciples, with wholehearted devotion prostrate ourselves in reverence, bowing to the Jade Emperor, Great Heavenly Honored One, Mysterious Lofty High Sovereign. With each subsequent invocation, as before, we chant the sacred title and bow once more.\n\nMay peace and joy prevail, and the divine wind spread afar;\nMay noble encounters and official promotions be granted;\n\nMay wealth and treasures overflow, and clothing and sustenance come naturally;\nMay blessings flow to descendants and be transmitted through generations;\nMay all inauspicious stars reverse and descend as auspicious signs;\nMay all desires and wishes of the heart be fulfilled;\nMay clothing and sustenance come naturally, and descendants be honored and noble;\nMay words spoken be rare and heard, and met with reverence wherever they reach;\nMay exalted rank and esteem illuminate and magnify one’s household;\nMay auspiciousness blaze brightly, and calamities and obstacles be kept at bay;\nMay the roots of the Dao run deep, and long-standing good affinities be present;\nMay the foundation of the Dao be firmly planted, and fields of blessings widely sown;\nMay all that is requested in the heart be granted in full;\nMay elixirs and wondrous treasures be freely taken as one wills.\n\nWe, your disciples, with wholehearted devotion prostrate ourselves in reverence, bowing to the Most Supreme Heaven of Maitreya, the Boundless Sky.\n\nIn the wondrous realm of Mysterious Reality,\nThe distant Purple Gold Towers stretch on;\nThe Great Tenuity Jade Clarity Palace,\nThe Boundless, Most Supreme Sage.\nVast and luminous, radiance unfolds,\nSerene and silent, boundless in origin.\nThe Mysterious Model encompasses the ten directions,\nThe tranquil and still, true and constant Dao.\nVast and empty, great spiritual power,\nThe Jade Emperor, Great Heavenly Honored One, Mysterious Lofty High Sovereign.\n\nWe, the registered ministers led by so-and-so, and the disciples of the Great Dao, reverently and sincerely submit this memorial to the Three Clarities and Three Realms Heavenly Worthies, the Golden Watchtower Jade Emperor, the Divine Father and Divine Mother, the Most Sacred and Most Perfected, the Yang of Heaven, Earth, and Water, and all the sages of the ten directions. We humbly beseech your vast compassion to turn your luminous gaze upon us.\n\nWe, your disciples, have heard: among the many, none are without wishes, yet their wishes differ; each person has their own heart—how could all hearts be the same?\n\nThose who have fallen desire to rise; the lowly long for nobility.\nThe poor seek wealth; the suffering crave peace.\nSome aspire to realize the Dao and attain perfection;\nothers strive to aid the people and benefit all beings—\neach has their own prayers.\nHow could there be those without wishes?\nYet only when their wishes are fulfilled will they find release.\n\nWe reverently recall that the wondrous Dao, in its boundless compassion,\ncan fulfill the aspirations of all beings.\nDaring to present our supplications,\nwe humbly rely upon your luminous grace.\n\nMay you deign to regard the sentiments of mortals,\nincline your celestial ear to our pleas,\nrespond to each according to their karmic conditions,\nand grant their wishes as their hearts desire.\nWhether for self or others,\nwhether for the hidden or the manifest,\nmay all attain fulfillment of their aspirations,\nand may none see their wishes thwarted.\n\nWe, your ministers and disciples, together with all our heartfelt devotion,\nalong with our departed ancestors, living kin,\nall beings in the dusty world, and the wandering souls of the long night,\nprostrate ourselves in utmost sincerity, taking refuge and offering reverence.\n\nWith devoted hearts, we bow in homage to the Jade Emperor, Great Heavenly Honored One, Mysterious Lofty High Sovereign.\n\n[With each subsequent line, as before, one bow is offered:]\nMay the world resound with songs of joy and the nation know great peace.\nMay the beings in hell be reborn in the heavenly realms.\nMay the sufferings of the three evil destinies be instantly dissolved.\nMay the Dharma be expounded for the ten directions.\nMay divine radiance shine forth, illuminating all realms.\nMay the six realms of existence and the four saintly states all partake of the Dao’s blessings.\nMay the assemblies of sages and worthies flourish throughout the heavens.\nMay the land be pure and the people content in their

the five declines and four signs of decay,\nand instead accumulate celestial blessings.\nMay kings, ministers, and the multitudes swiftly attain the joys of long life in heaven and among humans.\nMay those who pass away master the Dao of liberation through the dissolution of the body.\nMay all demonic forces dwell peacefully in the heavenly palaces,\nand may the sufferings of war and strife find rest.\nMay all beings escape the torments of hell and attain the bliss of the Pure Land.\nMay all hungry ghosts be sated and freed from the pangs of hunger and thirst.\nMay all animals be released from their suffering and gain the joy of wisdom.\n\nWith devoted hearts, we bow in homage to the Supreme Mystery, the Boundless Wondrous Existence,\nthe Vast and Profound Realm of the Purple Gold

      "translated_text": "**The Jade Emperor’s Absolution and Bestowal of Blessings Precious Repentance Sutra**\n\n**Title:** *The Jade Emperor’s Absolution and Bestowal of Blessings Precious Repentance Sutra*. One fascicle. Originally attributed to Commander Xin Hanchen of the Thunderous Might Officials.\n\n**Source:** *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongzhen* Section, *Weiyi* Category.\n\n---\n\n**The Jade Emperor’s Absolution and Bestowal of Blessings Precious Repentance Sutra**\n*Composed by Commander Xin Hanchen of the Thunderous Might Officials*\n\nWe, the registered Daoist officials, reverently kindle true incense and sincerely memorialize:\nTo the Scriptural Teaching Master, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of Original Commencement;\nTo the Jade Emperor, the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy;\nTo the Heavenly Worthy Who Disseminates the Sacred Teachings and Descends into Birth;\nTo the Jade Sovereign of the Ten Thousand Heavens, the August Thearch;\nTo the Sacred Father, the Heavenly Worthy of the King of Radiant Splendor and Wondrous Joy;\nTo the Sacred Mother, the August Lady of Precious Moonlight;\nTo the boundless true sages who attend the imperial audience and all the perfected immortals—\n\nWe humbly recall:\nIn the secluded abodes of the Mysterious Park, the Primordial One ascends the throne of radiant light;\nManifesting incarnations to assemble, the Jade Emperor expounds the sutra of his former conduct.\n\nIn times past, there was the King of Wondrous Joy, named Pure Virtue, and his queen, Precious Moonlight. Anxious over the lack of an heir, they commanded the Daoist clergy to offer prayers throughout the land. Half a year passed, yet their resolve never wavered. Moved by their devotion, the Supreme Dao Lord and the host of perfected beings arrived in a five-colored chariot, bearing an infant whose pores emitted light, transfiguring the palace halls. At the queen’s earnest entreaty, they bestowed the child as heir. Born with divine spirit, he grew in benevolence. The people sang of his Dao, and his transformative influence permeated all without effort. Having entrusted the kingdom to his ministers, he entered the mountains to cultivate the supreme Dao, practicing alchemy to heal the sick and aiding the state to save the people. First attaining the rank of Golden Immortal, he later ascended to become the Jade Emperor—a marvel unheard of in former times, beyond all praise.\n\nWe, having received boundless grace across kalpas and been transformed over countless lives, lament our foolish and deluded nature, which has accumulated grievous transgressions. How dare we not confess and repent, beseeching original absolution? Thus, in reverence to the sacred canons, we exert ourselves in remorseful reflection, praying to sever obstructions and dissolve transgressions, hoping to avert calamities and accumulate blessings. May our hearts’ desires be fulfilled, and may we realize sagehood and attain perfection.\n\nAs this repentance ritual is proclaimed, we first invoke the descent of the true immortals, humbly entreating their compassion, that we may attain spiritual communion.\n\nWe pray that the world may become like lapis lazuli, that the immortals may ride the nine-jeweled, golden-hued wheels converging in splendor, their ten-ornamented feathered canopies soaring aloft. May the divine winds play music, harmonizing with treasures, while flowers form canopies to cover all; may phoenixes sing and simurghs cry, dragons dance and qilins frolic, all wheeling and whirling at the celestial zenith. May they descend upon the mortal realm, bringing joy and celebration to gods and humans alike, and may our sins and faults be eradicated. Should our prayers be answered, what greater fortune could there be?\n\nWe, along with our disciples, prostrate ourselves in awe, gazing toward the celestial majesty, awaiting your descent with utmost reverence. Trembling with sincerity, we bow our heads to the ground, fixing our thoughts upon your august countenance, trusting in your radiant grace. In accordance with the scriptures, we recite the gāthā spoken by the Lord of the Highest Void and Luminous Heaven, to offer our praise:\n\n*Golden Portal’s Mysterious Vault Lord,*\n*Exalted Jade Emperor Supreme.*\n*Wondrous form crowns all heavens,*\n*Compassionate light illumines the Three Realms.*\n*True sage, teacher of the wondrous Dao,*\n*On whom gods and humans rely.*\n*The Great Vehicle’s dharma words descend,*\n*The True One points the way to the lost.*\n*Virtue vast as empty space,*\n*Praise and extolment never end.*\n\nWe, the registered Daoist officials, along with the disciples of the Great Dao, reverently bow again and memorialize the Three Clarities, the August Sages, the Jade Emperor the Supreme, the Imperial Father and Imperial Mother, the Most Sacred and Most Perfected, the Ten Directions and Three Realms, and all true numina.\n\nWe have heard that the sagely virtue is boundless, beyond all record or praise; the feelings of mortals, when moved, should exhaust all laudation. His wondrous vision and wondrous knowledge are peerless; his great compassion and great mercy inspire pity and mercy. Thus, following the scriptures, we recount his titles, hoping to align our thoughts with devotion.\n\nTen mighty names scarcely suffice to praise his ineffable title; seventeen lights, though exhaustive, cannot encompass his infinite radiance. Vast as \"Heaven,\" yet Heaven cannot compare; ultimate as \"Dao,\" yet all Dao emanates from him. Even the golden mouth could not exhaust his glory—how could the dusty world ever know it? We merely gather words from the scriptures to extol his sagely virtue.\n\nWe pray that uttering one good word may give rise to all virtues in the heart; that praising ten names may dissolve all sins recorded in the ledgers. May kindness, harmony, and humility grow ever greater; may wisdom and eloquence gradually attain perfection. Together with all sentient beings, may we realize the supreme Dao.\n\nWe, along with our disciples, prostrate ourselves in utmost sincerity, universally dedicating this to our departed ancestors, living kin, all beings in the dusty world, and the souls lost in the long night. With reverence, we take refuge and bow in faith.\n\nWe, with wholehearted devotion, prostrate ourselves and pay homage to the Jade Emperor, the Great Heavenly Worthy, the August Thearch of the Mysterious Vault.\n\nWe, with wholehearted devotion, prostrate ourselves and pay homage to the Jade Emperor, the Great Heavenly Worthy, the August Thearch of the Mysterious Vault, who wields the six spiritual powers, with all joining in praise.\n\n*(Each line of the celestial titles below is followed by the assembly’s response of \"Heavenly Worthy\" and a bow.)*\n\nWe, with wholehearted devotion, prostrate ourselves and pay homage to the One who radiates great light in the White Jade Capital.\n\nWithin the Golden Portal, the Seven-Treasure Mysterious Park.\nIn the Hall of Great Illumination, upon the Throne of Light.\nMost exalted among the sacred, purest above all.\nBody adorned with precious radiance, form wondrous and fair.\nSwift in transformation, keen in wisdom; ever benevolent in growth.\nKind, harmonious, and humble; having achieved merit, transcending the world.\nRenouncing love to study the Dao, practicing alchemy to heal the sick.\nDelivering sentient beings, widely bestowing expedient means.\nBroadly proclaiming the true transformation, spreading divine works.\nAiding the state and saving the people, practicing forbearance for their sake.\nRadiating great light, manifesting rare and wondrous signs.\nLord of the vault of heaven, sovereign of the kalpas.\nWondrous vision, wondrous knowledge, without peer or equal.\nProfoundly still, truly pure, beyond annihilation or permanence.\nMost sacred, most numinous, wielder of great spiritual powers.\nTreasure-house of light, great and mighty one.",

      "translated_text": "When the nature is once indulged, transgressions accumulate more heavily than mountains and hills; when the heart once repents, sins dissolve and disperse like ice and snow. Thus, the luminous teachings of the fundamental scriptures and precepts make clear the karmic causes of sin and blessing—how dare we fail to awaken a heart of repentance, only to persist in indulging our nature? With utmost sincerity and earnestness, we humbly beseech Your sacred compassion. May the ten evils and five rebellions be dissolved through our prostrations; may the three karmas and six senses be cleansed through our praises. We dare not conceal or hide anything, but confess all fully and with utmost effort. May we be bathed in Your mercy, and may You grant us special pardon. We pray that the myriad sins of a thousand offenses vanish in an instant; that the faults accumulated over many lives and kalpas be extinguished before the Dao.

      "translated_text": "When the dark haze disperses, the sun regains its clarity; when floating clouds scatter, the heavens shine with radiance. If not swept away, how can one avoid persistent obscuration? The heart has yet to merge with the sun and moon, so hindrances must be cleared like clouds and mist.\n\nWe look up to the Primordial Sage’s compassion and proclaim the wondrous Dharma of severing obstructions, that all dust may cease to arise and the true realm reveal itself. Yet how can deluded ordinary beings, failing to cultivate according to the Dharma, avoid following emotions and chasing after phenomena? How can they settle their thoughts and concentrate their spirit?\n\nExternal demons disturb their supreme Dao, corrupt their spiritual roots, and steal their most precious treasure. Entangled in worldly nets, they sink into the common stream. Ten thousand demons assail them, and their singular truth is lost. Without the virtue of refinement and transformation, how can they achieve the merit of severing hindrances?\n\nFollowing the wondrous scriptures in repentance, we seek to sweep away all obstructions. Thus, we humbly implore and earnestly beseech: may you bestow the sword of wisdom to sever and extinguish all afflictive hindrances. Sweep away the floating veils, that the radiance of the sun of wisdom may shine; brush aside the dust of toil, that the pearl of the heart may gleam with purity.\n\nMay our mortal forms be purified, the fruit of the Dao perfected, and both the hidden and manifest realms together recognize the singular luminous nature. May we forever escape transmigration and eternally attain freedom.\n\nWe, your disciples, led by so-and-so, prostrate ourselves in utmost devotion, reverently bowing and submitting this prayer for all—our departed ancestors, living kin, all beings of the dusty world, and the wandering souls of the long night.\n\nWith single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the August Jade Emperor, the Supreme Sovereign of the Lofty Vault of Heaven.\n\nWith single-minded devotion, we bow in homage, each reciting the sacred title of the Heavenly Worthy and prostrating once, praying:\nMay no doubts arise,\nMay no greed or anger arise,\nMay no lust arise,\nMay no jealousy arise,\nMay no killing arise,\nMay no worldly attachments arise,\nMay no worldly thoughts arise,\nMay no dullness or filth arise,\nMay no attachment to sounds or forms arise,\nMay no right or wrong arise,\nMay no clinging to love arise,\nMay no discrimination arise,\nMay no arrogance arise,\nMay no attachment arise,\nMay thoughts be settled and the mind clear,\nMay the ten thousand spirits be subdued,\nMay the heart be as empty as space,\nMay inner and outer purity prevail,\nMay the body attain purity,\nMay all calamities be transcended,\nMay we behold the compassionate countenance,\nMay all be sheltered and delivered,\nMay all hear the wondrous Dharma,\nMay we personally make offerings,\nMay we forever escape transmigration,\nMay evil roots be severed,\nMay our names be recorded in the Mysterious Capital,\nMay all thoughts cease,\nMay the ten thousand conditions instantly still,\nMay delusions be cast aside,\nMay we uphold this scripture,\nMay nothing be excluded,\nMay nothing be rejected,\nMay external demons not disturb,\nMay the true source not be lost,\nMay the spiritual root not be corrupted,\nMay we not sink into the common stream,\nMay we not fall into worldly nets,\nMay the ten thousand demons not assail,\nMay we hear the true Dharma,\nMay habitual tendencies be relinquished,\nMay we cultivate all wondrous practices,\nMay we attain the gates of liberation,\nMay we share in pure faith,\nMay we share in pure understanding,\nMay we share in pure mindfulness,\nMay we share in pure conduct,\nMay we share in pure embodiment,\nMay we share in pure heart,\nMay we share in pure intention,\nMay we share in pure fruition,\nMay we share in pure retribution,\nMay we share in great compassion,\nMay we share in great mercy,\nMay we uphold the precepts with single-mindedness,\nMay we meditate deeply on the great Dao,\nMay we protect the true source,\nMay we honor and serve our parents,\nMay we reverently respect the Three Treasures,\nMay we exhaust loyalty to our sovereign,\nMay we refrain from killing or stealing,\nMay we refrain from lust or jealousy,\nMay we refrain from anger or hatred,\nMay we refrain from arrogance or deceit.\n\nWith single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the Supreme Heaven of Grand Network, the Wondrous Existence of the Mysterious True Realm, the Vast and Luminous Purple Gold Portal, the Grand Tenuity Jade Purity Palace, the Boundless and Supreme Sage. Vast and luminous, still and boundless, without origin. The Mysterious Model encompassing the ten directions, the Profoundly Still and Eternally Constant Dao. The Vast and Mighty Spiritual Power, the August Jade Emperor, the Supreme Sovereign of the Lofty Vault of Heaven.\n\n*Recitation:*\nThe August Jade Emperor’s cultivation flourished in Fragrant Grove,\nRadiating seventeenfold divine light.\nTo teach beings and remove obstructions,\nThe Dharma gate of True Oneness is widely proclaimed.\n\n*Response:* The inconceivable merits are boundless.\n\nWe, the registered officials and disciples of the Great Dao, led by so-and-so, reverently bow and humbly submit this memorial to the Three Pure Ones of the Three Realms, the August Jade Emperor of the Vast Heaven, the Divine Father and Divine Mother, the Most Sacred and Most True, the True Sovereigns of Heaven, Earth, Water, and Yang, and the Illuminated Lords of the Ten Directions.\n\nWe have heard that the formless and nameless alone stand supreme as the Dao; those with form and appearance cannot escape calamity. Even heaven and earth have their periods of closure and end, the sun and moon their eclipses. How much more so for humankind, each nurturing a mortal body? Unable to transcend fate or rise above conditions, we remain subject to the stars and bound to destiny. The thinness of predestined fortune, the weight of past karma—when dwellings turn adverse and times grow inauspicious, how can we avoid calamity? How can we escape misfortune?\n\nGreat disasters—floods, fires, bandits, and thieves—may escalate into illness, exile, the six extremes, the five declines, the seven harms, the eight difficulties, the three calamities, the four malevolent forces, the nine adversities, and the ten entanglements. When affliction befalls a nation, the nation cannot be at peace; when it strikes a year, the harvest cannot be bountiful. War, famine, displacement—having followed the teachings, we now repent and pray to avert these disasters.\n\nMay all be sheltered and delivered, all calamities dispelled. May predestined fate be reversed and past karma dissolved; may baleful stars retreat and adverse destinies be pacified. For the individual, residual misfortune may be quelled and crises averted; for the myriad beings, karmic retribution may be escaped and great disasters avoided. May we dwell securely in the dusty world, our actions ever meeting with fortune; may we reach the shore of the Dao, untouched by calamity. May we enjoy robust health, all beings live in peace, and heaven and earth endure forever.\n\nWe, your disciples, led by so-and-so, prostrate ourselves in utmost devotion, reverently bowing and submitting this prayer for all—our departed ancestors, living kin, all beings of the dusty world, and the wandering souls of the long night.",

Having eradicated past sins, we are certain that future disasters will be averted. We trust in your compassion and mercy, which will surely heed our earnest pleas. Daring to express our reverent homage, we humbly await the descent of your exorcistic grace.
