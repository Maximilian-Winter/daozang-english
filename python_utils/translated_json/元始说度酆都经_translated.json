Two scriptures bound in a single fascicle. Source text: *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, Orthodox Section, Part One.\n\n---\n\nAt that time, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy addressed the Five Ancient August Ones, the sacred peaks of all directions, the August Kings of the Eighty Myriad Myriad Lands, the Perfected Lords of the Great One, the Twenty-Four Yin Officials of the Twenty-Four Treaties, the bureaus of the Three Offices of the Northern Prefecture and the Three Offices of the Nine Prefectures—those who govern the registers of life and death, where suffering and joy are repaid as echo answers sound, and where karmic retribution unfolds in perfect accord.\n\nNow, for the sake of all sentient beings, the *True Scripture of the Seven Primes* is expounded. It liberates people through the Dao, establishes the revolving mechanism of the heavens, circulates through the Three Realms, and encompasses the three hundred and sixty-five degrees, aligning below with the earth’s mechanisms—azure, yellow, vermilion, white, and purple-crimson.\n\nFor heaven and earth, the seven prime essences and their configurations have been set, and the twenty-eight lunar lodgings established. The sun and moon govern yin and yang, and the twenty-four bureaus oversee the weight of human transgressions and blessings, as well as the prohibitions. Now, for the sake of lesser-learned Daoists, this scripture is revealed so that all sentient beings may attain peace and joy, forever departing from Fengdu and escaping the fetters of the lower ghosts.\n\nAt that time, the Heavenly Worthy addressed the Seven Perfected of the Northern Yin Great Emperor, saying: In this world, people dwell in the floating realm, all nurtured by the qi of the sun and moon, the sovereigns of yin and yang. Their lives are bound to the Seven Primes, their qi to the Thirty-Six Bureaus, their five viscera to the Five Emperors, and their six receptacles to the Six Offices. Yet all are tainted by defilement, and thus disturbed by lower ghosts. Their primordial essence and pure qi cannot descend, causing people to act with malice, disloyalty, impiety, injustice, unkindness, and irreverence. After the stars of the Three Luminaries cut short their lives, they enter Fengdu as sinful ghosts. Their dead souls do not disperse, but coalesce into baleful qi, surging upward to assail the heavenly palaces.\n\nThe Most High, moved by compassion, commanded that a sincere plea be made, and for the sake of all sentient beings, the *True Scripture of the Seven Primes* was expounded. Methods were revealed and talismans established to deliver the deluded and bestow merit. If there are Daoists within the Three Realms who, during the final kalpa when heaven and earth are on the verge of collapse, when the people wail in distress, when wind and rain come unseasonably, when the world is in chaos, and when plagues slay the masses, encounter the Three Caverns’ Daoists and carry this scripture to traverse the Middle Kingdom, performing rites for all people, establishing the Seven Prime Dao altars, lighting lamps and pacing the Dao, prostrating and presenting memorials, wearing talismans and registers, and invoking the August Supreme Perfected, the Nine Clarities’ Lords of the Dao, the Lords of the Three and Five, the Jade August Ones of the Five Emperors, and the officials of the Three Realms—all will bear witness and record their names. They will pass through the Eight Difficulties, their names inscribed on golden tablets, and attain the immortality of the perfected.\n\nThe Seven Perfected said: If in future ages there are Daoists who aspire to the ranks of immortals, whether dwelling in mountain valleys or amidst the court and marketplace, and they encounter calamities—blades, warfare, flood, fire, or plague—where countless people perish, and they resolve to burn incense, light lamps, and pace the Dao for one, two, or three seven-day periods, or forty-nine days, day and night illuminating lamps, summoning us, the Seven Perfected, and the mighty spirits who guard the numinous, to establish the Northern Emperor’s Seven Prime Disaster-Dispelling Precious Rite, petitioning the Northern Yin to erase their names from the registers of death and deliver them from Fengdu, forever departing the offices of the ghosts—then they may take seven feet of white silk, inscribe upon it this divine talisman, and upon completing the rite, place it in a green pouch, encase it in a dragon casket, and cast it into a northern sacred mountain. Thus, they will pass through the Twenty-Four Prisons of Fengdu and not be seized by the Earthly Officials.\n\nIf any Daoist seeks the various methods without receiving this talisman, ghosts and spirits will not fear them, and divine numina will not descend. They will incur transgression, their names bound to the bureaus of Fengdu, and they will be fettered by lower ghosts.\n\nThe Seven Perfected said: If there are Daoists who uphold our methods with devotion, they may attain deliverance from the world and have their names entered in the immortal registers. Such perfected ones may become the world’s good teachers. When the world’s fortunes wax or wane, they may act within it, saving and transforming all sentient beings, uniting them with our Dao.\n\nFormerly, the Supreme Emperor of the Northern Heavenly Center of the Great Tenuous Realm commanded us to save the countless people of the world. On days of calamity, array our positions, establish the Great Seven Prime Lamps, pace the Dao and revolve the scripture thrice daily, reciting the Northern Culmen’s Demon-Slaying Heavenly Peng Divine Incantation. Sound the drums to initiate the rite, and the martial officials and numinous officers will descend. Summon the Ten Heavenly Demon Kings to capture ghosts and cure illnesses, aiding the celestial upright qi and assisting the nation and its people. Wear the divine talismans to guard the Five Directions and sever the spectral ghosts. Strike the thunderous bells and chime-stones, pacing the Dao forty-nine times, and we shall lead the Northern Direction’s essence-riders, the Dark Warrior’s Great Spirits, the Guardians of the Numinous, the Five Ding Great Spirits, the Black Killer Great Spirits, the Ten-Thousand-Zhang Mighty Sword Spirit Kings, the Thirty-Six Heavenly Heavenly Peng Great Generals, the Five Lakes’ Great Spirits, the Dipper’s Envoys, the Three Heavenly Perfected Lords, the Primordial Essence Great Spirit Kings, the Black-Clad Spirit Lords, and the Heavenly Net’s Direct Talisman Officers—three hundred thousand in all—to surround and descend upon the ritual arena, sweeping away a thousand demonic ghosts. Ten thousand spirits will drive them off and sever them. Above, the Heavenly Net is unfurled; below, the Stellar Net is spread, protecting and aiding the Daoists as they act in the world to save and heal the masses.\n\nHaving mastered all methods and accomplished the unsurpassed Dao, their merit will move us.\n\nThe Seven Perfected said: The Great Emperor’s illustrated registers of Fengdu’s departments decree that any Daoist who wears the Most High’s divine incantation and the *Register of the Scripture on Liberation* but lacks the wondrous source, and has not received the true scripture and the Fengdu Great Talisman, will fail in their cultivation, and the divine numina will not assist them. If any Daoist wishes to receive the divine incantation scripture, they must offer forty feet of white silk, one bolt of purple-woven fabric, fragrant oil, rice, flour, cinnabar, paper, and ink. The masters shall receive these, make sincere petitions, and transcribe the scripture and registers in a secluded chamber, ensuring no leakage. They shall perform offerings to the August Supreme Perfected, the Perfected Lords of the Nine Ultimates, the Lords of the Three Clarities, the spirits of the Five Emperors, and the envoys of Fengdu, arranging thirty-six offering trays with spirit money and horses for the continuation of life. The transmission must be kept secret.\n\nThen was spoken the Incantation for Crossing Fengdu:\n\nThe Great Mystery’s purple mist,\nThree Primes entwine in spiral grace.\nNine Origins open the Dao,\nLuminous demon-quelling true words.\n\nWho wears this incantation’s might\nShall enter the Golden Gate’s embrace.\nPassing through Fengdu’s dark domain,\nForever freed from ghostly office’s chains.\n\nThree hun-souls commune with the Dao,\nSeven po-souls’ yin spirits align.\nFlowing essence, jade radiance bright,\nIrrigates my form and soul divine.\n\nAbove, the Dharma-gate unfolds,\nThe Flying Celestial Dharma-wheel turns.\nUrging the Three Realms to hasten,\nI attain the utmost Perfected truth.\n\nInscribed in the Great Mystery’s roll,\nDemon-kings shall vouchsafe my name.\nThe Northern Dipper revolves in its course—\nHasten, hasten, as the statutes command!\n\nThe Seven Perfected declared: In ages yet to come, those who encounter this scripture and incantation, who bear the root of destiny and are marked by the Mystery’s design, shall be fit to receive and wear it. Let them not treat their masters lightly nor disdain the scripture through arrogance. Those of shallow learning and base ignorance must not be taught. The prohibitions are solemn—beware, beware!\n\nThe Seven Perfected having thus instructed, they commanded the Great Demons of the Five Emperors and the gods of the Three Realms: From this day forth, if any Daoist receives and upholds this divine incantation, traversing the Three Realms in observance and practice, turning the scripture and walking the Dao for the sake of all beings, wearing the talismans and registers—when calamity befalls any being, let them practice this Dao to deliver and succor the multitudes. Let them hang silk banners and floral streamers, recite the true scripture, and regulate their breath with divine qi to aid the Daoist in curing illness, ensuring no harm befalls. Thereafter, the Ten Heavenly Demon-Kings and all the gods of the Ten Directions and Three Realms shall elevate your rank.\n\nThe Seven Perfected said: Daoists of later learning who wear this talisman must wholeheartedly revere their masters, honoring them as the sun and moon, offering respect and reverence. They must not recklessly transmit it to the ignorant, the dissolute, the coarse, the wicked, or the rebellious. This talisman is guarded by thirty thousand warriors and two hundred thousand mighty spirits who slay demons and protect the people. It must not be treated lightly or carelessly revealed, lest one incur calamity for seven kalpas and forever lose the Perfected Dao.\n\nAt that time, the Five Elders received the command, bowed their heads, and upheld the charge.\n\nThus concluded the *Scripture for Crossing Fengdu* as spoken by the Primordial Beginning.",
