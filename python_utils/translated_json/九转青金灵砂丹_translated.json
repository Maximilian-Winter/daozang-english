  "full_translation": "**Nine-Turned Azure-Gold Numinous Cinnabar Elixir**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *Nine-Turned Azure-Gold Numinous Cinnabar Elixir*\n*Author unknown, likely composed during the Tang dynasty. One fascicle.*\n*Source text:* *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Section of Numinous Writings*, *Category of Miscellaneous Arts*.\n\n---\n\n### **Nine-Turned Azure-Gold Numinous Cinnabar Elixir**\n\n**Ingredients:**\n- One *jin* of mercury\n- Four *liang* of sulfur\n\n**Method:**\nOn a *yang* day, construct a furnace using over ten clean earthen bricks, two *chi* in height, round above and square below. The furnace chamber should be one *chi* and five *cun* deep. Place seven iron rods at the base to separate the charcoal fire, leaving a five-*cun* wind gate below. The furnace mouth should be one *chi* wide. Fill the chamber with approximately five *jin* of charcoal as the standard measure.\n\nOnce dry, take a new iron cauldron, wash it clean with water, and place it atop the furnace to dry thoroughly. Rub the interior with ginger dipped in vinegar, then apply a small amount of yellow wax to moisten it, and wipe it with paper.\n\nFirst, melt the sulfur into a liquid, then pour in the mercury. Hold the cauldron with tongs and stir continuously with a spatula. If small flames arise, sprinkle rice vinegar to extinguish them, then resume stirring. Continue sprinkling vinegar until one bowl’s worth has been used, and the mixture turns azure in color. Allow it to cool, then remove and grind it finely through a sieve. This is called *Azure-Gold Head*.\n\n---\n\n### **First Turn: Fire-Tamed Numinous Cinnabar**\nTake a pair of crucibles, scrub them clean, and dry them thoroughly. Once cooled, gently spoon the *Azure-Gold Head* powder into the fire crucible, ensuring it is not overfilled. Mix red halloysite with vinegar and apply it to the rim, then place the water crucible atop it, pressing firmly. Bind them tightly with iron wire, and seal the exterior entirely with *Six-Yi* salt clay. Suspend the crucibles with an iron rod.\n\nArrange five *jin* of charcoal in the furnace, placing the hardest pieces at the bottom. Add five *liang* of kindling, then suspend the medicinal crucible above the charcoal within the water crucible. Pour boiling water into the water crucible to eight-tenths full. Fan the wind gate to ignite the fire, beginning gently (*wen*) and then intensifying (*wu*). Ensure the water in the crucible does not boil over nor run shallow, adding more as needed.\n\nIf any sealed areas emit vapor, promptly seal them with thin clay using a bamboo spoon. Continue until the furnace cools. The next day, open the crucible—the numinous cinnabar will have ascended to the base of the water crucible. Remove and refine the elixir; this cinnabar may be formed into treasures. Retain the furnace incantations for later use.\n\n---\n\n### **Second Turn: Double-Circulating Elixir**\nTake the fire-tamed numinous cinnabar and grind it finely. First, melt four *liang* of sulfur, then pour in the cinnabar powder and stir-fry until it turns a reddish-purple, ensuring even fusion. If flames arise, sprinkle with vinegar. Once cooled, remove, grind finely through a sieve, and place in the crucible as before. Seal it, return it to the furnace, and use five *jin* of charcoal as previously. Ignite the fire and replace the water in the crucible, maintaining the process for one full cycle (*fu*). Once the furnace cools, open the crucible—the cinnabar will have risen to the base of the water crucible. Remove and refine the elixir.\n\nThe ash remaining in the fire crucible is the sulfur from the previous turn, now transformed into *true dead sulfur ash*. Collect it, as it effectively treats dysentery and *ling* disorders. Form it into pills with rice paste, the size of *tung* seeds. Administer three pills per dose with jujube decoction for immediate efficacy.\n\n---\n\n### **Third Turn: Purple Radiance Elixir**\nTake the double-circulating elixir and grind it finely. Melt three *liang* of sulfur in a cauldron, then pour in the elixir powder and stir-fry until it turns purple. Once evenly mixed and cooled, remove, grind finely through a sieve, and place in the crucible as before. Seal it, return it to the furnace, and use five *jin* of charcoal as previously. Ignite the fire, replace the water in the crucible, and maintain the process for one full cycle. Once the furnace cools, open the crucible—the cinnabar will have risen to the base of the water crucible as before. Remove and refine the elixir; retain the ash for future use.\n\n---\n\n### **Fourth Turn**\nTake the purple radiance elixir and grind it finely. Melt three *liang* of sulfur in a cauldron, then pour in the elixir powder and stir-fry evenly. Once cooled, remove, grind finely through a sieve, and place in the crucible as before. Seal it, return it to the furnace, and use five *jin* of charcoal, arranged as previously. Ignite the fire, replace the water in the crucible, and maintain the process for one full cycle. Once the furnace cools, open the crucible and remove the elixir for further refinement. Retain the ash as before.\n\n---\n\n### **Fifth Turn**\nTake the fourth-turn elixir and grind it finely. Melt two *liang* of sulfur in a cauldron, then pour in the elixir powder and stir-fry evenly. Once cooled, remove, grind finely through a sieve, and place in the crucible as before. Seal it, return it to the furnace, and use five *jin* of charcoal as previously. Ignite the fire, replace the water in the crucible, and maintain the process for one full cycle. Once the furnace cools, open the crucible and remove the cinnabar elixir for further refinement.\n\n---\n\n### **Sixth Turn**\nTake the fifth-turn elixir and grind it finely. Melt two *liang* of sulfur in a cauldron, then pour in the elixir powder and stir-fry evenly. Once cooled, remove, grind finely through a sieve, and place in the crucible as before. Seal it, return it to the furnace, and use five *jin* of charcoal as previously. Ignite the fire, replace the water in the crucible, and maintain the process for one full cycle. Once the furnace cools, open the crucible and return the cinnabar elixir to the furnace for further refinement.\n\n---\n\n### **Seventh Turn: Returning Elixir**\nTake the sixth-turn elixir and grind it finely. Melt one *liang* and five *qian* of sulfur in a cauldron, then pour in the elixir powder and stir-fry until it turns azure. Once cooled, remove, grind finely through a sieve, and place in the crucible as before. Seal it, return it to the furnace, and use five *jin* of charcoal as previously. Ignite the fire and replace the water in the crucible.\n\nAt this stage, the elixir will no longer ascend; instead, use a *borer bellows* to intensify the fire. Fashion the bellows from paper, resembling the wind bag used by silversmiths, and apply it to the furnace’s wind gate. Do not be alarmed by sounds emanating from the medicinal crucible. Maintain the process for one full cycle. Once the furnace cools, remove the elixir for further refinement.\n\n**Eighth Turn**\nTake the *returning elixir* and grind it finely. Melt one *liang* and five *qian* of sulfur in a cauldron, then pour in the elixir powder and stir-fry. Once cooled, remove, grind finely through a sieve, and place in the crucible as before. Seal it, return it to the furnace, and use five *jin* of charcoal as previously. Ignite the fire and replace the water in the crucible. At this stage, the elixir will settle and no longer ascend; use a *borer bellows* to intensify the fire and nurture it for one full cycle. Once the furnace cools, remove the elixir for further refinement.\n\n**Ninth Turn: True Yang Elixir**\nTake the eighth-turn elixir and grind it finely. Melt one *liang* of sulfur in a cauldron, then pour in the elixir powder and stir-fry until it turns powder-white and even. Once cooled, remove, grind finely through a sieve, and place in the crucible as before. Seal it, return it to the furnace, and use five *jin* of charcoal as previously. Ignite the fire and replace the water in the crucible for one full cycle. Once the furnace cools, open the crucible to find the elixir rising within, resembling a silver bowl. Chisel it out, break it into pieces, and place in a clean porcelain jar. Seal the jar’s mouth with oiled silk, bind it tightly with thread, then melt yellow wax and pour it over to ensure an airtight seal. Dig a three-*chi* pit in the earth, place the elixir jar at the bottom, and bury it. After seven full cycles, retrieve it to dispel the fire-toxin. Once the time is complete, remove the elixir, grind it finely in a mortar, sift it, and mix with black donkey’s milk to form pills the size of small *wutong* seeds. Once dried, store them in the furnace. This elixir has now been fully refined.\n\n**Offering of Gratitude**\nTo the spirits of Heaven and Earth: when consuming, steep seven red dates in water and swallow three pills in the morning. This will prevent illness. Those who are young and vigorous should not take it.\n\n**On Elixir Refinement**\nChoose a pure foundation for refinement, as this ensures efficacy. Women, those with hidden ailments, chickens, cats, and dogs must not be present, or the elixir will fail to manifest its power.\n\n**The Nine-Turn Azure Gold Spirit-Cinnabar Elixir is now complete.**",
