  "full_translation": "**The Fifty-Fourth Scroll of the *Ten Books on Cultivating Perfection*: Diagrams of the Five Viscera and Six Bowels from the *Inner Radiance of the Yellow Court***\n\n**Preface to the Diagrams of the Five Viscera and Six Bowels from the *Inner Radiance of the Yellow Court***\n*Composed by Hu Jing of the Plain Maiden of Mount Taibai*\n\nThe heavens govern yang, nourishing humanity with the five qi; the earth governs yin, nourishing humanity with the five flavors. Yin and yang unite to form the qi of the five viscera, dispersing into the four limbs, twelve divisions, and three hundred sixty joints, transforming into the meridians, fluids, blood, and marrow. They coalesce into the six bowels, triple burner, and twelve meridians, communicating through the nine orifices. The five viscera, as the root of human form, govern all. If one viscus is damaged, a hundred illnesses arise; if all five are damaged, the body perishes.\n\nThus, the five viscera are the masters of spirit, luminosity, hun-soul, po-soul, will, and intent. The heart governs spirit, the liver governs the hun-soul, the lungs govern the po-soul, the spleen governs intellect, and the kidneys govern essence. Externally, they manifest as the five affairs, corresponding above to the five planets and below to the five sacred mountains. All emulate heaven and earth, bearing the images of the sun and moon—so vast in kind as to defy enumeration.\n\nIf one can preserve spirit through cultivation and discipline the self with resolve, the Dao will be achieved. When the bones and qi are firm and strong, internal putrefactions and poisons cannot invade, nor can external illnesses and pernicious qi cause harm. Clarity and purity flourish, aging is reversed, and years are prolonged. With lofty aspirations, one attains the immortals’ realm, the body free from fatigue. The essence and radiance of the sun and moon draw near, the six qi of the four seasons harmonize with the body. One enters the Dao of transformation, penetrates the principles of spirit and luminosity, grasps yin and yang, and regulates the breath and spirit. The Creator is thus mastered by the self.\n\nAt this stage, one need not rely on golden elixirs or jade fluids, nor the great return of langgan jade. Naturally, spirit transforms into emptiness, merging with the Great Harmony to ascend the heavens. The qi of the five viscera coalesces into five clouds, entering the celestial realm. To the left, one summons the yang spirits of the Six Jia; to the right, one calls the yin spirits of the Six Ding. A thousand transformations, ten thousand changes—riding flying chariots at will.\n\nThose who fail to awaken exhaust themselves in external pursuits, truly ignorant of the Dao of life. Thus, the *Taibai* states: When essence is full, it becomes spirit; when qi is full, it becomes the Dao. Preserve spirit and nurture qi, uphold steadfast integrity. Yin and yang unite to establish the true form.\n\nYet, lamenting my dull nature, I longed for the compassionate gate, cultivating a mind of non-action and dwelling in tranquility. I studied the wondrous principles of the *Yellow Court*, delved into the remnants of the jade tablets, my aspirations scorched and heart shattered, years passing in vain. Observing old diagrams, I found their profound secrets and obscure paths, their abstruse words and principles. Some works expound the mysterious and compliant, others point to forms and images, or briefly record the names of spirits. Various schools arose in emulation, giving rise to heterodoxies, leaving later learners bereft of entry. A deviation of a hair’s breadth leads to an error of a thousand miles.\n\nNow, I have gathered my humble insights, exhausting my shallow knowledge, and arranged these diagrams according to the classics. First, the viscera and bowels are clarified; next, cultivation is explained. Causes of illness, methods of exhalation and inhalation to dispel disease, auxiliary principles of medicine, guiding and stretching, observing complexion and seeking symptoms, dietary prohibitions—all are included. May later learners, by following these diagrams, perceive all methods, with every detail illuminated.\n\nWith reverence, I bow my head, prostrate myself, and inscribe this with utmost care.\n\n---\n\n**Diagrams of the Five Viscera and Six Bowels from the *Inner Radiance of the Yellow Court***\n\n**Diagram of the Lung Viscus**\n\nTo invigorate the lungs, use swallowing; *xi*-breathing serves as supplementation.\n\nThe lungs are the Metal Palace, the canopy of the five viscera. Originally one, they reside above, facing the chest with six lobes, their color like red silk shimmering. In men, at eighty, the lung qi declines, and the po-soul scatters.\n\nWeighing three catties and three taels, the lungs correspond to the west, the white color entering and communicating with them. Their orifice is the nose; the left nostril is *geng*, the right is *xin*. In form, they govern the skin and hair. The lung meridian emerges at *Shaoshang*.\n\nThe lungs are the root of qi and the chief of the viscera; thus, all qi pertains to them. Prolonged lying down harms the qi. When qi fills the lungs, it becomes the passage for breath and the palace of transmission. The *po*-gate is also called the Jade Hall Palace. The lungs are the palace of transmission, from which governance and regulation emanate.\n\nTheir fluid is nasal mucus. Mucus is the fluid of the lungs; when kidney perversity enters the lungs, mucus increases. The lungs generate coughing from the right.\n\nThe six bowels include the large intestine, which pairs with the lungs as the bowel of transmission and conduction. The nose is the official of the lungs; when lung qi flourishes, the nose is unobstructed. When the lungs are diseased, one cannot distinguish fragrance from stench.\n\nThe lungs pair with the spleen; their glory is the hair. If the skin slackens and the hair falls, the lung qi is already dead. They correspond to the west, the *dui* trigram of Metal, receiving at *yin*, generating at *si*, flourishing at *you*, ailing at *hai*, dying at *zi*, and entombed at *chou*.\n\nIn autumn, the lungs are at their peak, the kidneys assist, the liver dies, the heart is imprisoned, and the spleen rests. The days are *geng* and *xin*, the western celestial stems; the hours are *shen* and *you*, the western earthly branches. As Metal, they support Earth, restrain Water, and overcome Wood. In the hours, they assist in autumn, flourish in winter, rest in spring, are imprisoned in Fire, and bloom in summer.\n\nTheir note is *shang*, the sound of Metal. Their sound disperses; it can be sharp to clarify warmth and empty the lungs. Their color is white, the color of Metal and the lungs, like the sound generating color. A withered sound indicates death.\n\nTheir flavor is pungent; its nature is dispersing. Eating it first moves the qi; if consumed hastily or in excess, the skin suffers. Its odor is rank; when heart perversity enters the lungs, one detests rankness.\n\nTheir nature is righteousness, the righteousness of lung qi. Their nature is anger; the nature of Metal is hardness and governs anger. Within the lungs, one also visualizes white qi.\n\nThe spirit of the lungs is *Haohua*, styled *Xucheng*. The lungs are the qi of *dui*, the essence of Metal. Their color is white, their form like a suspended chime. Their spirit resembles a white beast.\n\nThe lungs generate the po-soul, transforming into jade lads, seven inches tall, clad in white, bearing weapons, coming and going in the lung palace. Some say the lungs are guarded by seven lads and fourteen jade maidens.\n\nThe spirit of the lungs is prone to anger, for human anger arises from the lung viscera. To pacify the po-soul and preserve its form, one must gather thoughts and restrain desires, embrace benevolence and nurture righteousness without anger; when angered, do not raise the voice. Calm the Metal qi to preserve life, thus aligning with the Great Harmony.\n\nThe lungs connect with the large intestine and govern the nose above; thus, when wind invades the lungs, the nose becomes congested. A withered complexion indicates dryness of the lungs. An itchy nose suggests the presence of worms within. Excessive fear signifies the po-soul’s departure from the body. A body darkened by fumes reflects weakened lung qi. A loud voice indicates exuberant lung qi. Intolerance of cold and heat signifies lung taxation. A preference for pungent flavors reveals insufficiency of lung qi. Intestinal rumbling arises from lung congestion. A fresh, pale complexion indicates healthy lungs. When lung qi is perverse, the person is prone to weeping.\n\nThe lungs govern illnesses of the *shang* note; one should sigh. Sighing is the qi of the lungs, its nature righteousness, enabling one to recognize lung ailments. Thus, when anger fills the chest, one should exhale deeply to dispel it—this is self-regulation. Without sighing, injury and decay will surely follow. Through sighing and exhalation, wholeness is restored; therefore, lung illnesses require purging through sighing. A person who sighs without cause portends misfortune.\n\nThe lungs reside in the seventh palace, governing trust, fostering uprightness and integrity. Cultivating loyalty first ensures the po-soul’s peace and the body’s wholeness. Moreover, the lungs govern the three months of autumn, a time of balanced countenance. Heaven’s qi grows urgent, earth’s qi becomes clear; sparrows retreat while chickens rise. One’s will should remain tranquil, easing the autumn’s sharpness. Gather and restrain spirit and qi, harmonizing them. Do not let the will stray outward, keeping lung qi pure. This is the principle of nurturing life; violation leads to coughing, snoring, and wheezing.\n\n**Method of Cultivation:**\nRegularly at dawn on the first and fifteenth days of the seventh, eighth, and ninth months, sit facing west. Strike the Heavenly Drum seven times, swallow the Jade Fluid, then close the eyes and compose the mind. Visualize the white qi of the *dui* palace entering the mouth, swallowing it seven times. Hold the breath for seventy cycles. Thus, the spirit becomes profound, the body harmonized, and no evil dares approach. Weapons cannot harm, lifespan extends, and one’s name is inscribed in the register of flying immortals—this is the result of supplementing and purging qi, pacifying breath, and stabilizing the ethereal soul.\n\n**Method for Diagnosing Lung Viscera Illness:**\nWhen the lungs are afflicted with heat, the right cheek reddens. Lung disease manifests as a white complexion with withered hair, wheezing, coughing, counterflow qi, and pain in the chest, back, and limbs. One may dream of beautiful women approaching intimately. Lung deficiency causes shortness of breath, inability to catch one’s breath, dry nose, and parched throat. Lung wind leads to excessive sweating, aversion to wind, frequent coughing that ceases only when qi is exhausted, worsening at dusk. Diagnosis lies above the eyebrows, where the color is white. The lungs govern autumn, and the hand *Taiyin* and *Yangming* channels govern treatment; the days are *geng* and *xin*. If lung qi ascends counterflow, swiftly consume bitter flavors to purge it.\n\nIt is also said: when the lungs are diseased, they desire gathering; consume sour flavors to collect them, use pungent to supplement, and bitter to purge. Avoid cold foods, for the lungs detest cold. In lung disease, symptoms include qi binding the right side of the body at the navel, pain upon pressure, and suffering from coughing—this is heat. To treat lung viscera illness:\n\nFor lung ailments such as nasal congestion, inability to smell fragrance or stench, nasal polyps, sores above, dry and itchy skin, malignant sores, scabies, tinea, counterflow qi, coughing, and spitting of pus and blood, take the *Dispersing Wind Powder*:\n- *Ren Shen* (Ginseng) eight *fen*\n- *Xuan Shen* (Scrophularia) seven *fen*\n- *Fang Feng* (Saposhnikovia) eight *fen*\n- *Sha Shen* (Glehnia) five *fen*\n- *Tian Xiong* (Aconite) eight *fen*\n- *Shu Ye* (Dioscorea leaf) ten *fen*\n\n*Salvia* (Dan Shen) seven *fen*,\n*Kushen* (Sophora) eight *fen*,\n*Qin Jiao* (Gentiana) seven *fen*,\n*Xiao Zhu Yu* (Evodia fruit).\n\nGrind the above ingredients into a fine powder. Take three *qian* on an empty stomach with *Fang Feng* (Saposhnikovia) decoction. Gently draw qi in through the nose and exhale through the mouth, ensuring the ears do not perceive sound. First regulate and harmonize the qi, then perform the exhalation.\n\nFor lung ailments, perform the great swallow thirty times and the fine swallow ten times. This dispels taxation heat in the lung, counterflow qi, coughing, sores on the skin, vexing pain in the four limbs, nasal congestion, chest and back pain. Repeatedly perform these swallowing methods to cure malaria; cease once cured, for overdoing it causes harm.\n\nIn the seventh month, do not consume *Zhu Yu* (Evodia), as it induces bloody dysentery. In the eighth and ninth months, avoid ginger, liver, heart, and lung.\n\nFor lung disease, it is suitable to consume bitter flavors such as millet and peaches.\n\n**Daoist Breathing Exercises (Daoyin Fa):**\nSit upright, place both hands on the ground, contract the body, and arch the spine upward, lifting three times to dispel wind evil and taxation in the lung. Alternatively, turn the fists backward and strike the spine, three to five times on each side. This method dispels wind toxin in the chest and diaphragm. Perform while holding the breath for an extended period; close the eyes, swallow saliva, and knock the teeth together three times to conclude.\n\n*Illustration of the Five Viscera and Six Bowels from the Scripture of the Yellow Court’s Inner Radiance*\n*Illustration of the Heart Viscus*\n\nTo treat the heart, use the *he* (exhalation) sound for purging and inhalation for supplementation. The heart is the Fire Palace, located below the lungs and above the liver, opposite one *cun* below the *jiuwei* point. Its color resembles white silk suffused with crimson, and its shape is like a lotus bud yet to bloom. For men, by the age of sixty, the heart’s *qi* declines, leading to frequent slips of the tongue and forgetfulness. It weighs twelve *liang*. The south’s red color enters and connects with the heart, which opens at the tongue and manifests in the pulse, emerging at the *Zhongchong* point.\n\nThe heart is the root of life and the dwelling of the spirit. Moreover, it governs all the viscera, its luminous function generating life. Thus, the heart stores the spirit and serves as the sovereign’s office, from which clarity and insight emerge to oversee the four directions. It is also called the Five Spirit Lords or the Grand Commandant. The heart, as the emperor, resides in the center and is also named the Hall of Light.\n\nThe heart’s external manifestation is the *yi* (sigh) when *qi* causes pain in the heart. Its fluid is sweat, for sweat is the heart’s liquid, just as the kidneys’ fluid is urine. When the heart is in harmony, sweat is moderate; when disordered, sweat is profuse.\n\nThe small intestine is the heart’s bowel, and their pairing forms the receptacle for transformation. The tongue is the heart’s official; when the heart’s *qi* flows freely, the tongue discerns the five flavors. In heart disease, the tongue becomes scorched, curled, and shortened, unable to distinguish flavors. Its paired tissue is the vessels, and its flourishing color is red. When the blood and vessels are deficient and fail to nourish the viscera, the heart’s bowel is the first to perish.\n\nThe heart corresponds to the south’s *Li* Fire. Fire receives *qi* in *hai*, is born in *yin*, flourishes in *wu*, ails in *shen*, dies in *you*, and is entombed in *xu*, ruling summer. The heart flourishes while the spleen assists; the lungs perish, the kidneys are restrained, and the liver rests. The heavenly stems *bing* and *ding* govern the south’s *wu* position, while the earthly branches *chen* and *si* govern the south’s branch positions. Fire supports Wood and restrains Earth; it is strongest in summer and late summer, overcomes Metal, and fears Water. In the four seasons, it is restrained in spring, rests in autumn, and perishes in winter.\n\nIts sound is *zhi*, the tone of Fire, harmonious yet swift. Its color is red, the hue of Fire, resembling the heart of a rooster; if it appears thus, life endures, but if black, death follows. Its flavor is bitter, its nature firm; consuming it first reaches the bones. Those with bone diseases should avoid excessive intake, lest their nails wither. Its associated quality is scorching, for the heart’s malign influences naturally accumulate as heat. Its nature is propriety, governed by joy, the emotion of Fire. Joyful by nature, it governs dryness. The heart corresponds to the Southern Marchmount and connects with the essence of Mars. During the three months of summer, visualize Mars within the heart, or imagine a red *qi* residing there.\n\nThe heart spirit is *Danyuan*, styled *Shouling*.\n\n**Symptoms of Heart Disease:**\nA moving *qi* above the navel, firm and painful to the touch, with heart vexation and distress. In heart disease, the palms and soles of the hands and feet grow hot.\n\n**Methods to Treat Heart Viscus Disease:**\nWhen the heart is afflicted, the mouth becomes dry, the tongue stiff, or the throat sore, making swallowing difficult. Mouth sores may appear, memory fails, and one dreams of forges or smelting. The *Five Ginseng Pill* is suitable:\n- *Qinjiao* (7 *fen*)\n- *Renshen* (7 *fen*)\n- *Xuanshen* (10 *fen*)\n- *Ganjiang* (10 *fen*)\n- *Shashen* (5 *fen*)\n- *Suanzao* (8 *fen*)\n- *Danshen* (8 *fen*)\n- *Kushen* (8 *fen*)\n\nGently draw *qi* through the nose and exhale through the mouth, regulating the breath as above, ensuring no sound reaches the ears before exhaling. For heart disease, perform a deep *he* thirty times and a gentle *he* ten times to dispel heart taxation, heat, and all vexation. When using purgation for heart ailments, cease once the illness is cured; overdoing it will cause harm.\n\n**Dietary Prohibitions:**\nIn the fourth month, avoid garlic, as it causes premature graying and hair loss. In the fifth month, avoid *peng* (a toxic plant), as it harms the heart. Also avoid consuming the heart and kidneys, which induce heart pain. Barley and wheat are suitable, while *huo* (a grain) and salty flavors should be avoided.\n\n**Daoist Breathing Exercises for the Heart Viscus:**\nSit upright, make fists with both hands, and strike forcefully left and right, six times each. Alternatively, sit upright, press one hand on the wrist, and push downward with the other as if lifting a heavy stone. Interlace the fingers, place the feet on the hands, and press five or six times. These methods dispel wind evil and all diseases in the heart and chest. Conclude by visualizing *qi*, holding the breath for an extended period, closing the eyes, swallowing saliva three times, and knocking the teeth together three times.\n\n*Illustration of the Liver Viscus*\n\nTo treat the liver, use the *xu* (exhalation) sound for purging and inhalation for supplementation. The liver is the Wood Palace, located below the heart, slightly to the left, with three lobes. Its color resembles white silk suffused with indigo. For men, by the age of sixty, the liver’s *qi* declines, its lobes thin, the gallbladder shrinks, and vision dims. It weighs four *jin* and four *liang*. The east’s green color enters and connects with the liver, which opens at the eyes—the left eye is *jia*, the right *yi*—and manifests in the sinews. The liver’s pulse emerges at *Dadun*.\n\nThe liver’s color is verdant, resembling overlapping layers. It is the root of endurance and the dwelling of the *hun* soul. The left eye is the sun and the King Father, the right eye the moon and the Queen Mother, the source of tears and the essence of *yin*. The liver is called the Grand Chancellor or the Celestial Minister, residing in the Palace of Clarity.\n\nThe liver generates on the left, and its *qi* governs speech. When *qi* flows freely through the liver, its fluid is tears. When the kidneys’ malign influences invade the liver, tears flow excessively.\n\nThe gallbladder is the liver’s bowel, and their pairing governs the eyes. When the liver’s *qi* flows freely, the eyes see clearly; when the liver is replete, the eyes redden. The liver pairs with the sinews, and its flourishing is in the nails. If the sinews slacken and cannot contract, the liver is the first to perish.\n\nThe liver corresponds to the east’s *Zhen* Wood. Wood receives *qi* in *shen*, dies in *wu*, is born in *hai*, flourishes in *mao*, ails in *si*, and is entombed in *wei*. The liver governs while the heart assists; the spleen perishes, the lungs are restrained, and the kidneys rest. The heavenly stems *jia* and *yi* govern the east’s stem positions, while the earthly branches *yin* and *mao* govern the east’s branch positions. Wood supports Water, restrains Fire, overcomes Earth, and fears Metal. In the four seasons, it assists in winter, flourishes in spring, rests in summer, is restrained in late summer, and perishes in autumn.\n\nIts sound is *jiao*, the tone of Wood. Its color is green, the hue of Wood. Its flavor is sour, its nature flexible; consuming it first reaches the sinews. Those with sinew diseases should avoid excessive intake, lest their nails wither. Its associated quality is rancid, for the liver’s malign influences naturally accumulate as putrefaction. Its nature is benevolence, governed by anger, the emotion of Wood. The liver corresponds to the Eastern Marchmount and connects with Jupiter’s essence. During the three months of spring, visualize Jupiter within the liver, or imagine a green *qi* residing there.\n\nThe liver spirit is *Longyan*, styled *Hanming*.\n\nThe sound is *jiao*, the tone of Wood, its resonance descending yet restrained, its harmony tranquil and clear, capable of initially nourishing the liver.\n\nIts color is green, the hue of Wood and the liver; when it resembles the sheen of kingfisher feathers, it signifies vitality, but when it resembles withered grass, it portends death.\n\nIts flavor is sour, its nature astringent; when consumed, it first reaches the sinews. Those with sinew diseases should avoid excessive intake, lest their skin wither and hair fall.\n\nIts nature is benevolence, for the liver’s *qi* governs benevolence, delighting in Wood and the flourishing of life, and thus presiding over joy.\n\nThe liver corresponds to the Eastern Marchmount, connecting above with the essence of Jupiter. During the three months of spring, visualize Jupiter within the liver, or imagine a green *qi* residing there.\n\nThe liver spirit is *Longyan*, styled *Heming*.\n\nNow, the liver is the *qi* of *Zhen* (Thunder) and the essence of Wood. Its form is green, resembling a suspended gourd, and its spirit takes the shape of a green dragon.\n\nThe liver governs the *hun*-soul, which transforms into two jade lads—one clad in green, the other in yellow—each nine inches tall, bearing jade nectar from the liver’s store.\n\nSome say the liver is guarded by three lads and six jade maidens.\n\nIts spirit delights in benevolence, for kindness and grace emanate from the liver’s store. Thus, those who pacify their *hun* and prolong their governance shall see even thorns and brambles receive the dew of mercy.\n\nIt governs the sinews; when the liver is deficient, the sinews contract. When a person’s skin withers, it is due to heat in the liver; when their flesh bears speckles, it is liver-wind; when their complexion is green, the liver is in excess; when they crave sour foods, the liver is insufficient; when their hair withers, the liver is damaged; when their hands and feet sweat excessively, it is not an illness. If lung-pathogens invade the liver, they cause frequent weeping.\n\nThe liver governs the sinews, and when the liver is afflicted, one should employ *xu*. *Xu* is the liver’s *qi*, its nature benevolent, capable of dispelling pain and decay—all natural confirmations. Is it not *xu* that accomplishes this? Such is the profound and mysterious Dao of utmost principle.\n\nThe liver resides in the third palace, governing benevolence, fostering solemnity, kindness, and grace. When it extends to others, the *hun* is at peace and the form is whole.\n\nTo engage the liver is to act in spring’s three months, when heaven and earth’s *qi* quickens, and all things flourish—flowers bloom in profusion, leaves luxuriate, and the *qi* of benevolence first sprouts. Rise early and retire late, stroll leisurely in the courtyard, loosen your hair and relax your form to nurture the will. Give life and do not kill, bestow and do not seize, reward and do not punish—this is the Dao of nurturing life in spring. To contravene it injures the liver, causing hair and skin to lose their luster, inviting cold, and diminishing the capacity to sustain life.\n\n**Cultivation Method:**\nRegularly, on the first day of the first, second, and third months, sit facing east at dawn, click the teeth three times, hold the breath for ninety cycles, and inhale the green *qi* of the *Zhen* Palace into the mouth, swallowing it nine times to replenish deficiency and damage. Partake of the Green Dragon’s essence to sate the hunger of the two lads. When Wood’s essence rides Earth, joy abounds and sorrow diminishes—such is the subtlety of nurturing essence.\n\n**Diagnosing Liver Diseases:**\nWhen the liver is hot, the left eye reddens.\nWhen the liver is diseased, the eyelashes droop, the lower eyelids ache, and pain radiates to the lower abdomen, causing frequent anger.\nWhen the liver is deficient, one feels fearful, as if about to be seized.\nWhen the liver is in excess, one is prone to rage; when deficient, one feels cold.\nWhen *yin* *qi* is robust, one dreams of mountains, trees, gardens, and sprouting grasses—signs of the liver’s *qi* flowing freely.\nHeadaches, deafness, swollen cheeks, aversion to wind, frequent anger, and blurred vision manifest in the eyes, with a greenish complexion.\n\nIt is also said that liver diseases prevail in spring, with the Foot *Jueyin* and Foot *Shaoyang* as exterior-interior pair, governing treatment. The days are *jia-yi*, and if the liver is tense, consume sweet flavors to relax it.\n\nFurther, when the liver is diseased and desires dispersion, swiftly consume pungent flavors to disperse it; use salty flavors to tonify and pungent flavors to purge. Avoid wind, for the liver detests it.\n\n**Liver’s Inhalation-Exhalation Method:**\nGently draw in *qi* through the nose and exhale through the mouth with *xu*.\nFor liver diseases, perform a deep *xu* thirty times and a gentle *xu* ten times to dispel deficiency-heat from the liver and eliminate stiffness and dimness in the four limbs.\nFor all heat conditions, repeatedly perform *xu* in a continuous, unbroken manner for optimal effect. Cease when the disease is alleviated; excessive practice may cause harm.\n\n**Foods to Avoid When Raw:**\nIn the first month, do not consume raw scallions—those with heat should especially avoid them.\nIn the second and third months, avoid garlic bulbs, knotweed seeds, and the hearts of all herbs; do not eat liver or lungs. Consume sesame seeds, *jugengzi*, and plums.\nAvoid pungent flavors.\n\n**Dao-Yin Method**\n\n**Dao-Yin Method (continued):**\nOne may sit upright, place both hands one over the other beneath the ribs, and slowly bend the body to the left and right, three to five times each side. Alternatively, sit upright, clasp the hands, interlock the fingers, and turn them outward toward the chest three to five times—this dispels accumulations, wind, and pathogenic *qi* from the liver. The rest follows as above.\n\n**Illustrated Diagram of the Five Viscera and Six Bowels from the *Huangting Neijing*:**\n**Spleen Viscus Diagram**\nTo treat the spleen, use *hu* (exhalation) for purgation and *xi* (inhalation) for supplementation. The spleen is the Earth Palace, governing the Great Granary, located three *cun* above the navel, its color like white silk suffused with yellow.\n\nBy the time a man reaches seventy, the spleen’s *qi* becomes deficient, and his skin withers and emaciates. It weighs two *jin* and three *liang*, its central hue yellow. It connects internally to the mouth—the mouth corresponds to *wu* and *ji*, the tongue to *ji*. In form, it is the spleen; in pulse, it emerges as the hidden. The spleen is the pivot of the five viscera.\n\nThe spleen is the root of flesh and the seat of intention. It is the Yellow Court, the Central Lord, the Yellow Dragon Sovereign, the Remonstrating Minister, the Granary Officer, and the Transformer of Things—styled the Central Yellow Palace. The spleen governs the center, harmonizing the valley *qi*; its fluid is saliva. When kidney pathogens invade the spleen, excessive drooling occurs.\n\nThe six bowels: the stomach is the granary of the five grains, paired with the spleen as the Grain Palace. The five officials: the mouth is the spleen’s official. When spleen *qi* flows freely, the mouth discerns the five flavors; when the spleen is diseased, the mouth becomes dry, unable to eat, and loses taste for flavors. The spleen governs flesh; when flesh withers, emaciation follows, and one cannot grow plump. The spleen’s paired tissue is muscle. When the spleen dies first, it is due to its central Earth position.\n\nIt receives *qi* at *ji*, flourishes at *zi*, ails at *hai*, dies at *mao*, and is buried at *chen*. Its season is late summer; the spleen reigns, the lung assists, the kidney declines, the liver is imprisoned, and the heart rests. Its heavenly stem is *wu-ji* (central), its earthly branch *chen-xu-chou-wei* (central). Its element is Earth. In late summer, it is in its prime; in autumn, it rests; in winter, it is imprisoned; in spring, it dies. Earth supports Fire, restrains Metal, overcomes Water, and fears Wood—they interact in mutual balance.\n\nIts note is *gong*, the sound of Earth, which expresses harmony and breadth, embodying the spleen’s gentle strength. Its color is yellow, the hue of Earth and the spleen. If it resembles a crab’s belly, life persists; if it resembles the fruit of the *zhishi* tree, death follows. Its flavor is sweet, its nature moderate. When consumed, it first travels to the flesh; those with flesh ailments should not eat much, for excess harms the bones and causes hair loss. Its scent is fragrant; if heart pathogens invade the spleen, one detests fragrance.\n\nIts nature is trustworthiness. The spleen governs speech and fidelity; its emotion is fear, for Earth’s nature is to master fear. Externally, the spleen corresponds to the Central Marchmount and connects above to the essence of Saturn. During late summer and the last eighteen days of each season, visualize Saturn within the spleen, or meditate on yellow *qi*.\n\nThe spleen spirit is ever-present, named *Hunting*. The spleen is the *qi* of *kun* (Earth) and the essence of soil. Its color is yellow, its form like an overturned vessel, its spirit resembling a phoenix. The spleen’s intention transforms into a jade maiden, seven *cun* in length, circulating within the spleen viscus.\n\nIts spirit is fierce and jealous of others’ prosperity. When one prospers, it arises from the spleen’s envy. Earth has no fixed form, hence no constancy. Women’s envy is particularly strong, as it rides upon yin. To pacify intention, one must reduce desires and limit sensual indulgence. Diminish thoughts, quiet concerns, cultivate Earth’s virtue, and thereby preserve life—this aligns with the Great Yin.\n\nThe spleen connects to the stomach, governs the mouth above, and is the granary that digests grain, like a millstone turning, transforming the raw into the cooked. Undigested food results from the spleen’s failure to turn; hard foods that the spleen cannot fully grind become food stagnation. Thus, when the viscera are disharmonious, the constitution is harmed; when the constitution is harmed, the spirit is diminished, and the person is swiftly injured.\n\nTherefore, avoiding hard foods is the subtle path to preserving the body. Those who lose their appetite have undigested food in the spleen; those prone to confusion have an unsettled spleen viscus. Excessive eating indicates spleen deficiency; difficulty swallowing signals spleen cold; pallor reveals spleen damage. A preference for sweet foods indicates spleen insufficiency; a bright, lustrous complexion shows the spleen is healthy.\n\nWhen spleen pathogens invade the spleen, one sings excessively. As the spleen is the Earth Palace, its ailments should be treated with *hu* (exhalation). *Hu* is the spleen’s *qi*, and its force can dispel the spleen’s illnesses. Those with internal heat should use *hu* to expel dampness.\n\nThe spleen governs the *gong* note and trustworthiness, fostering broad-mindedness, humility, and benefiting others. It values restraint in profit, refrains from self-aggrandizement, and avoids contention over wealth—thus the spleen is at peace and the body whole. Moreover, the spleen has no fixed position; it flourishes in all four seasons, following the four *qi*. Assisting the *qi* of all things, it nurtures yang—this is the spleen’s righteous path. It does not seek virtue in monthly submission nor merit in material allure. This is the principle of *kun* (Earth). To act contrary harms the spleen.\n\n**Cultivation Method:**\nDuring the first day of late summer and the eighteenth day of each seasonal transition at dawn, sit in the Central Palace. Hold the breath for five cycles, strike the Heavenly Drum twelve times, and inhale the yellow *qi* of the *kun* Palace into the mouth, swallowing twelve times to replenish the depletion caused by *hu*. Drink the Jade Liquor Elixir to attain the flavor of the divine phoenix, thereby supplementing the spleen and aiding the spirit. One who practices this *qi*-restraining Earth essence will enter mountains unafraid of tigers and wolves, and traverse perilous paths without fear of stumbling.\n\n**Diagnostic Method:**\nIf the spleen is red, the nose is red; if the color is yellow and moist, the nose is likewise. In illness, wandering wind moves across the body, causing generalized heaviness, dull pain, and muscle atrophy, rendering the feet unable to walk. One favors singing, and the soles of the feet ache. Spleen deficiency leads to abdominal distension and rumbling, dysentery, and undigested food.\n\n**Spleen-Cold Disorders:**\nSpleen-cold disorders manifest with profuse sweating, aversion to wind, bodily lethargy, weakness in the four limbs, absence of jaundice, and loss of appetite. Diagnosis lies in the nose, where the color appears yellow. The spleen flourishes in late summer, governed by the Foot Greater Yin and Yang Brightness channels, corresponding to the days *wu* and *ji*.\n\nIf the spleen is damp, promptly consume bitter flavors to dry it. It is also said: when spleen deficiency leads to slackness, urgently take sweet flavors to relax it—sweetness supplements, while bitterness drains. Avoid dryness.\n\n**Symptoms of Spleen Disease:**\nIn spleen disease, a moving *qi* is felt near the navel; pressing it causes firmness, pain, and counterflow *qi*. The small intestine becomes acutely painful, with incessant diarrhea and severe blockage.\n\n**Spleen Visceral Breathing Method:**\nGently draw in *qi* through the nose with a long inhalation, then exhale through the mouth. For spleen disease, perform a great exhalation thirty times and a fine exhalation ten times. This dispels all cold *qi* from the spleen, resolves heat-induced cholera, undigested food, hemiplegic wind, stubborn numbness, and abdominal masses. Exhale repeatedly in succession without interruption; cease when the illness recedes, avoiding excess.\n\n**Dietary Prohibitions:**\nIn the sixth month, do not consume cornelian cherries, lest they induce red-and-white dysentery. In all four seasons, avoid the spleen, liver, and sheep’s blood; instead, eat japonica rice, jujubes, and mallow. Avoid sour flavors.\n\n**Dao-Yin Method.**\n\n**Dao-Yin Method:**\nOne may sit upright with one leg extended and the other bent, clasping both hands behind the back and pulling forcefully, repeating three to five times. Alternatively, kneel and press both hands to the ground, turning the head to gaze backward with the intensity of a tiger, repeating three to five times. This dispels accumulations, gatherings, and wind evil in the spleen viscus, and stimulates the appetite.\n\n**Illustration of the Five Viscera and Six Bowels from the *Huangting Neijing*:**\n**Kidney Viscus Diagram**\nFor the kidneys, use *chui* (blowing). Blowing serves as purgation; inhalation serves as supplementation.\n\nThe kidneys are the Water Palace, situated with the left kidney to the left and the right kidney to the right, positioned anteriorly opposite the navel and adhering to the spine. Their color resembles white silk suffused with purple. Generally, by the time a man reaches sixty, kidney *qi* declines, causing hair loss and tooth decay. As *qi* wanes, the meridians become desiccated and hollow. At seventy, the body’s form reaches its limit; at ninety, it resembles a tree with roots. The kidneys weigh two *jin* and two *liang*.\n\nThe north corresponds to black, entering and communicating with the kidneys, which open at the two yin orifices. The left kidney is *ren*; the right kidney is *gui*. In form, they govern the bones. Prolonged standing injures the bones. The kidney meridian emerges at *Yongquan* (Bubbling Spring).\n\nThe kidneys are the root of the viscus and the repository of essence. They serve as the Rear Palace and the female sovereign. The kidney meridian traverses the upper burner, flourishes in the middle burner, and defends in the lower burner. The kidneys are the official of strength and skill, from which ingenuity arises. They follow the patterns of images, governing principle and enduring stability. Their surplus *qi* communicates with the two orifices, manifesting as fluids and saliva. Saliva is a fluid; when *qi* enters the kidneys, saliva increases.\n\nThe bladder is the bowel of the kidneys, and together they form the bowel of fluid and jubilation. The ears are the officials of the kidneys; when kidney *qi* flows unimpeded, one hears the five notes. Kidney disease results in deafness and bone atrophy. The kidneys unite with the bones, and their flourishing is reflected in the hair. When bones atrophy and one cannot rise from bed, kidney *qi* has perished first—this serves as the standard.\n\nThe kidneys correspond to the north, the *kan* trigram, and Water. Water receives *qi* at *si*, is born at *shen*, flourishes at *zi*, ails at *yin*, dies at *mao*, and is entombed at *chen*. In winter, the kidneys flourish; the liver and heart die, the spleen is imprisoned, and the lungs rest. The days are *ren* and *gui*, the northern celestial stems; the hours are *hai* and *zi*, the northern earthly branches. Water supports Wood and generates Metal, restrains Water and overcomes Fire, fears Earth, is ministerial in autumn, flourishes in winter, rests in spring, is imprisoned in summer, and dies in late summer.\n\nIts sound is *yu* (feather), the tone of Water—deep and hollow, harmonious yet brief, dispersing and capable of movement. Its color is black, the hue of the kidneys. If it resembles a crow’s feather, one lives; if it resembles soot, one dies. Its flavor is salty; excessive consumption depletes the blood, so those with blood disorders should avoid it. Overindulgence causes the vessels to overflow and alters the complexion. Its odor is putrid; when pathogenic *qi* enters the kidneys, one detests putridity.\n\nIts nature is wisdom; the kidneys govern intelligence, and their affairs are sorrow, for Water’s nature is inherently sorrowful. Externally, the kidneys correspond to the Northern Marchmount, and above they communicate with the essence of the *Chen* (Mercury) star. During the three months of winter, visualize the *Chen* star within the kidneys, or store black *qi* therein.\n\nThe kidney spirit is *Qu Ming*, styled *Yu Ying*. The kidneys are the *qi* of *kan*, the essence of Water. Their color is black, their form resembles suspended stone, and their spirit resembles a two-headed deer. They govern intelligence and transform into a jade youth, one *chi* in length.\n\nWhen the kidney’s spirit is harmonious, one becomes gentle and compliant. Only after its arrival can life be preserved, aligning with the Great Clarity. The kidneys unite with the bones and govern the teeth above. Tooth pain indicates kidney damage. They also govern the ears; deafness arises from kidney deficiency. Bone pain stems from kidney vacuity. Frequent gum bleeding results from kidney vacuity. Tooth erosion is kidney wind. Ear pain is kidney *qi* congestion. Frequent yawning is kidney evil. Inability to straighten the waist is kidney freezing. A yellow-black complexion indicates kidney decline. A purple, radiant complexion in the kidneys portends no suffering. Bone creaking signifies kidney emaciation. When lung evil invades the kidneys, stretching increases.\n\nThe kidneys govern *yu* (feather), so kidney disease requires *chui* (blowing). Kidney *qi* is wise and can dispel kidney ailments. Thus, when accumulated *qi* surges into the chest, forcefully blowing kidney *qi* clears stagnation. Gentle blowing subtly unblocks it.\n\nThe kidneys reside in one palace, governing intelligence. They make one astute and agile, with a clear and unobstructed spirit, ensuring stability and bodily integrity. Moreover, the kidneys serve winter’s function. As *qi* closes between heaven and earth, the myriad things lie hidden. One retires at *xu* and rises at *yin*, aligning with profound yin. Externally yin and internally yang, they nourish the bones and tranquilize the spirit. Acting contrary injures the kidneys.\n\n**Cultivation Method:**\nRegularly during the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth months, face northwest and strike the *Jin Liang* (Metal Beam) ten times. Drink three mouthfuls of jade spring water, then inhale the black *qi* of the *Xuan Gong* (Mysterious Palace) into the mouth, swallowing it five times to supplement the flavor lost through blowing. Feed on the sustenance of white deer and prepare the compositions of jade youths. Harmonize the *qi* of the stalk and sing the breath; when spirit and body are at peace, no malevolent forces can harm you, and longevity is attained.\n\n**Diagnosing Kidney Viscus Disease:**\nWhen the kidneys are hot, the cheeks redden. Kidney disease manifests as a black complexion, withered teeth, abdominal distension, heaviness of the body, panting, coughing, sweating, and aversion to wind. Kidney disease causes pain in the lumbar region; wind induces frequent fear of drafts. Food and drink fail to descend, the diaphragm is cold and obstructed, the abdomen is full. Removing clothing causes abdominal distension; consuming cold induces diarrhea. The form is black and emaciated, yet the abdomen is large.\n\nFurthermore, the kidneys govern winter, and the Foot Lesser Yin and Greater Yang meridians govern their treatment. Their celestial stems are *ren* and *gui*. The kidneys suffer from dryness; urgently consume acrid flavors to moisten them and facilitate the flow of fluid *qi*. For kidney firmness and disease, urgently consume bitter flavors to weaken them. Use bitter to purge and salty to supplement. Avoid violating hot foods and warm clothing to prevent kidney dryness.\n\n**Kidney Disease Patterns:**\nIn kidney disease, there is moving *qi* below the navel. Pressing it resembles taxation disease, with suffering from undigested food in the abdomen, heaviness of the body, pain in the bones and joints, and external cravings.\n\n**Remedies for Kidney Afflictions**\n\nFor kidney diseases manifesting as lumbar and hip pain, cold impediment in the bladder, urinary dribbling with difficulty, or entanglement by hernia patterns, the **Eight-Ingredient Pill** is recommended.\n\n**Eight-Ingredient Pill Formula:**\n- Prepared rehmannia (*gan dihuang*): 8 parts\n- Tree peony root bark (*mudan*): 3 parts\n- Alisma (*zexie*): 3 parts\n- Cinnamon bark (*guixin*): 2 parts\n- Poria (*fuling*): 3 parts\n- Prepared aconite (*fuzi*): 2 parts\n- Dioscorea (*shuyu*): 4 parts\n- Cornus (*shanzhuyu*): 4 parts\n\nGrind the above ingredients into powder, mix with honey, and form into pills the size of *tong* seeds. Take thirty pills on an empty stomach with warm water.\n\n**Breathing Exercise for the Kidney Organ**\nInhale deeply through the nose, then exhale through the mouth.\n\nFor kidney disease, perform **strong exhalations** thirty times and **gentle exhalations** ten times. This dispels all cold-related lumbar pain, heavy knees, inability to stand for long, decline of yang vitality, tinnitus, and mouth sores—eliminating kidney-associated vexing heat. Practice repeatedly without interruption until symptoms abate; overdoing may cause harm.\n\n**Dietary Prohibitions**\n- In the tenth month, avoid consuming Sichuan pepper, as it dries the mouth and may induce red-and-white dysentery.\n- In the eleventh and twelfth months, avoid fresh scaled or shelled creatures, as well as spleen and kidney meats. Instead, consume soybeans, yellow sprouts, chestnuts, and *ji* herbs. The prohibited items are strictly forbidden.\n\n**Dao-Yin Exercises**\n1. Sit upright, raise both hands, and pull the face from the ears outward three to five times on each side.\n2. Place hands behind the back, interlock fingers, and stretch the body gently three to five times on each side.\n3. Extend the legs forward and backward, alternating ten times on each side.\n\nThese methods dispel wind evil, accumulations, and stagnation in the lumbar region, kidneys, and bladder. Other techniques follow the above principles.\n\n**Illustration of the Yellow Court’s Inner Radiance: The Five Viscera and Six Bowels**\n*Gallbladder Organ Illustration*\n\nThus, Heaven possesses the Five Phases to generate cold, heat, dryness, and dampness, while humans possess the five *qi* to engender joy, anger, sorrow, anxiety, and fear. Joy and anger harm the *qi*; cold and heat harm the form. When joy and anger are unchecked and cold and heat exceed their bounds, life is no longer preserved. If one can nurture life in accordance with the seasons, one may avoid the afflictions of Heaven.\n\nThe eyes should not gaze recklessly, the mouth should not speak recklessly, the ears should not listen recklessly, and the nose should not smell recklessly—these are the wondrous methods of nurturing life. Often rub the hands together until warm, then wipe the face twenty-one times, and likewise rub the entire body until thoroughly warmed. This is called \"dry bathing,\" which dispels misfortune and ensures the face shines with jade-like luster and golden radiance.\n\nMoreover, the five viscera, when augmented by the gallbladder, are called the six bowels. The gallbladder also receives the *qi* of Water and shares the Dao with *Kan* (the trigram ☵), so it cannot be categorized with the other bowels, hence a separate illustration of the gallbladder is provided.\n\nTo treat the gallbladder, use the *xi* (嘻) sound: *xi* is for purging, inhalation is for supplementation. The gallbladder adheres to the liver, its color like white silk veiled in blue, weighing three *liang* and three *zhu*. The gallbladder is the \"blue-green palace\" within, known as the General and the Deciding Official. It can be resolute yet gentle, its essence manifesting as the soaring serpent, embodying courage and vigor.\n\nThe gallbladder corresponds to the sinews and is the essence of the six bowels. It is the organ of central rectitude, where judgments are made. The gallbladder spirit is named Longyao, styled Weiwen.\n\nThe gallbladder is the essence of Metal and the color of Water; its hue is blue-green, its form like a suspended gourd. Its spirit resembles a tortoise and serpent, transforming into a jade youth, one foot in length, wielding a halberd, darting in and out of the gallbladder’s domain. Those with bold decisiveness owe it to the gallbladder’s influence.\n\nTo pacify its spirit, one must cease anger and embrace righteousness, thereby preserving life and harmonizing with Heaven’s great harmony. The gallbladder pairs with the bladder and governs the hair above. Thus, withered hair signifies gallbladder depletion; brittle nails, gallbladder deficiency; dry hair, gallbladder wind; scorched hair, gallbladder heat; dull eyes or tearing, gallbladder heat. A preference for bitter flavors indicates gallbladder insufficiency. A blue-green or lustrous white complexion signals a healthy gallbladder.\n\nThe gallbladder resides in the *Kan* palace, inspiring reverence for wisdom, admiration for virtue, rejection of deceit, and avoidance of flattery, embodying uprightness. The gallbladder is born of Metal, and Metal governs martiality, hence its boldness—yet it should be tempered for auspiciousness.\n\nThe gallbladder rides the *qi* of Yin and employs the function of Metal, thus governing desire. Desire breeds sorrow: as Metal is born of Water, tears fall from the eyes. The heart governs Fire, the gallbladder governs Water and bitterness. Fire is extinguished by Water, Water is boiled by Fire; when Yin and Yang contend, Water and gallbladder prevail over Fire, so tears flow from the eyes. Tears are akin to their source, hence their name. In sorrowful wailing, one may utter bitter words. The gallbladder is Water yet governs Yang; Yin follows Yang, so tears emerge from the eyes.\n\n**Methods of Cultivation**\nDuring the three months of winter, sit upright in pure contemplation. Inhale the black *qi* of the Northern Palace through the mouth, swallowing it thrice to replenish the depletion caused by *xi*, to fully benefit the gallbladder’s fluids. Consume the flavors of tortoise and serpent, drink the nectar of the jade youth, and the spirit will surge, the body harmonize. No evil can assail, no thief approach—such is the power of gallbladder *qi*.\n\n**Diagnosing Illness**\nWhen the gallbladder is afflicted, one sighs deeply, tastes bitterness, vomits undigested fluids, and feels a constant unease, as if fearing capture. The brows droop, the eyebrows wither. If the gallbladder is excessively replete, it generates heat, causing the spirit to wander and sleep to be restless. If deficient, it generates cold, inducing fear, dizziness, and an inability to sleep alone. Deficiency leads to brittle nails, dry hair, tearing eyes, and pain in the bladder, lower back, and lower abdomen.\n\nThe gallbladder shares a pathway with the liver; treat its ailments with liver viscera methods.\n\n**Dao-Yin Exercises**\nSit upright, raise the soles of the feet, tilt the head back, grasp the ankles with both hands, and shake three to five times. Alternatively, sit with legs extended, press the hands to the ground, lift the body, and stretch the spine three to five times. These methods dispel wind-poison and evil *qi* from the kidneys.\n\n**Breathing Techniques**\nGently draw in *qi* through the nose and expel it with the *xi* sound. For gallbladder and kidney ailments—including all cold Yin sweats, night sweats, pallor, lower abdominal distension, cold pain below the navel—urgently dispel them. For dry mouth, bitter tongue, repeatedly use *xi* to cure the illness.\n\n**Illustration of the Yellow Court’s Inner Radiance: The Five Viscera and Six Bowels**\n*Comprehensive Text and Illustrations of the Five Viscera*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor addressed Qi Bo, saying: \"Man is born by receiving the *qi* of Heaven and Earth. That which comes is called *essence*; the encounter of essence is called *spirit*; the emanation of spirit is called *divine*; the transformation of the divine is called *hun*. The *hun* follows the divine in its comings and goings, called *awareness*; the *essence* enters and exits in tandem, called *po*, which governs flourishing. The accumulation of *hun* forms the *heart*. The heart’s inclinations are called *emotions*; emotions with attachment are called *intent*; the direction of intent is called *will*; the recollection of will is called *thought*; the distant longing of thought is called *contemplation*; the fruition of contemplation in affairs is called *wisdom*. Wisdom encompasses all these manifestations—thus the functions of accumulated *divine*, *hun*, *po*, *intent*, *emotions*, *wisdom*, *awareness*, and *perception* are complete.\"\n\nScholar Sun Simiao remarked: \"Man is endowed by Heaven and Earth, thus internally possessing the five viscera, six bowels, *essence* and *qi*, bones and marrow, sinews and vessels; externally uniting the four limbs, nine orifices, skin and hair, nails and teeth, throat, lips and tongue, the gate of the womb, and the urinary bladder—all together forming the body. When nurturing and rest are properly regulated, the body remains at peace and functions harmoniously; if improper, the five taxations, seven injuries, and six exhaustions arise. Yet with proper methods, these can be remedied, and though illness may strike, no grave harm follows. Thus, within these illustrations, the five viscera and six bowels are fully described—the blood and vessels like springs, circulating and flowing, corresponding with the nine orifices in their meeting places, all exhaustively detailed here. Those who devote themselves to this practice, even in old age, will find no internal ailment afflicting them.\n\nThe hair should be frequently combed, the teeth often clicked, the saliva regularly swallowed, the *qi* constantly refined, and the *essence* perpetually preserved. These five practices are what is meant by 'if one wishes not to die, cultivate the Kunlun.' It is akin to refining the elixir to secure it, abstaining from grains to sustain it. When these methods are mastered, one records them in golden tablets and faces the heavens, drawing in the *qi* of the sun and ascending to emptiness—such are the arts of the adept.\n\nThe *Original Beginning of the Great Mystery Classic* states: 'Joy and anger harm the nature; excessive pleasure harms the spirit. When nature is harmed, life is endangered. Thus, nurture the nature to preserve the *qi*, guard the spirit to stabilize the body. When *qi* is whole, the body is balanced; when the heart is at peace, the spirit is at ease—this is the secret to preserving life.'\"\n\n*Illustrated and Comprehensive Record of the Five Viscera from the* Ten Books of Daoist Cultivation: *The Yellow Court’s Inner Radiance, Five Viscera and Six Bowels, Scroll Fifty-Four—Concluded.*",

      "translated_text": "**The Fifty-Fourth Scroll of the *Ten Books on Cultivating Perfection*: Diagrams of the Five Viscera and Six Bowels from the *Inner Radiance of the Yellow Court***\n\n**Preface to the Diagrams of the Five Viscera and Six Bowels from the *Inner Radiance of the Yellow Court***\n*Composed by Hu Jing of the Plain Maiden of Mount Taibai*\n\nThe heavens govern yang, nourishing humanity with the five qi; the earth governs yin, nourishing humanity with the five flavors. Yin and yang unite to form the qi of the five viscera, dispersing into the four limbs, twelve divisions, and three hundred sixty joints, transforming into the meridians, fluids, blood, and marrow. They coalesce into the six bowels, triple burner, and twelve meridians, communicating through the nine orifices. The five viscera, as the root of human form, govern all. If one viscus is damaged, a hundred illnesses arise; if all five are damaged, the body perishes.\n\nThus, the five viscera are the masters of spirit, luminosity, hun-soul, po-soul, will, and intent. The heart governs spirit, the liver governs the hun-soul, the lungs govern the po-soul, the spleen governs intellect, and the kidneys govern essence. Externally, they manifest as the five affairs, corresponding above to the five planets and below to the five sacred mountains. All emulate heaven and earth, bearing the images of the sun and moon—so vast in kind as to defy enumeration.\n\nIf one can preserve spirit through cultivation and discipline the self with resolve, the Dao will be achieved. When the bones and qi are firm and strong, internal putrefactions and poisons cannot invade, nor can external illnesses and pernicious qi cause harm. Clarity and purity flourish, aging is reversed, and years are prolonged. With lofty aspirations, one attains the immortals’ realm, the body free from fatigue. The essence and radiance of the sun and moon draw near, the six qi of the four seasons harmonize with the body. One enters the Dao of transformation, penetrates the principles of spirit and luminosity, grasps yin and yang, and regulates the breath and spirit. The Creator is thus mastered by the self.\n\nAt this stage, one need not rely on golden elixirs or jade fluids, nor the great return of langgan jade. Naturally, spirit transforms into emptiness, merging with the Great Harmony to ascend the heavens. The qi of the five viscera coalesces into five clouds, entering the celestial realm. To the left, one summons the yang spirits of the Six Jia; to the right, one calls the yin spirits of the Six Ding. A thousand transformations, ten thousand changes—riding flying chariots at will.\n\nThose who fail to awaken exhaust themselves in external pursuits, truly ignorant of the Dao of life. Thus, the *Taibai* states: When essence is full, it becomes spirit; when qi is full, it becomes the Dao. Preserve spirit and nurture qi, uphold steadfast integrity. Yin and yang unite to establish the true form.\n\nYet, lamenting my dull nature, I longed for the compassionate gate, cultivating a mind of non-action and dwelling in tranquility. I studied the wondrous principles of the *Yellow Court*, delved into the remnants of the jade tablets, my aspirations scorched and heart shattered, years passing in vain. Observing old diagrams, I found their profound secrets and obscure paths, their abstruse words and principles. Some works expound the mysterious and compliant, others point to forms and images, or briefly record the names of spirits. Various schools arose in emulation, giving rise to heterodoxies, leaving later learners bereft of entry. A deviation of a hair’s breadth leads to an error of a thousand miles.\n\nNow, I have gathered my humble insights, exhausting my shallow knowledge, and arranged these diagrams according to the classics. First, the viscera and bowels are clarified; next, cultivation is explained. Causes of illness, methods of exhalation and inhalation to dispel disease, auxiliary principles of medicine, guiding and stretching, observing complexion and seeking symptoms, dietary prohibitions—all are included. May later learners, by following these diagrams, perceive all methods, with every detail illuminated.\n\nWith reverence, I bow my head, prostrate myself, and inscribe this with utmost care.\n\n---\n\n**Diagrams of the Five Viscera and Six Bowels from the *Inner Radiance of the Yellow Court***\n\n**Diagram of the Lung Viscus**\n\nTo invigorate the lungs, use swallowing; *xi*-breathing serves as supplementation.\n\nThe lungs are the Metal Palace, the canopy of the five viscera. Originally one, they reside above, facing the chest with six lobes, their color like red silk shimmering. In men, at eighty, the lung qi declines, and the po-soul scatters.\n\nWeighing three catties and three taels, the lungs correspond to the west, the white color entering and communicating with them. Their orifice is the nose; the left nostril is *geng*, the right is *xin*. In form, they govern the skin and hair. The lung meridian emerges at *Shaoshang*.\n\nThe lungs are the root of qi and the chief of the viscera; thus, all qi pertains to them. Prolonged lying down harms the qi. When qi fills the lungs, it becomes the passage for breath and the palace of transmission. The *po*-gate is also called the Jade Hall Palace. The lungs are the palace of transmission, from which governance and regulation emanate.\n\nTheir fluid is nasal mucus. Mucus is the fluid of the lungs; when kidney perversity enters the lungs, mucus increases. The lungs generate coughing from the right.\n\nThe six bowels include the large intestine, which pairs with the lungs as the bowel of transmission and conduction. The nose is the official of the lungs; when lung qi flourishes, the nose is unobstructed. When the lungs are diseased, one cannot distinguish fragrance from stench.\n\nThe lungs pair with the spleen; their glory is the hair. If the skin slackens and the hair falls, the lung qi is already dead. They correspond to the west, the *dui* trigram of Metal, receiving at *yin*, generating at *si*, flourishing at *you*, ailing at *hai*, dying at *zi*, and entombed at *chou*.\n\nIn autumn, the lungs are at their peak, the kidneys assist, the liver dies, the heart is imprisoned, and the spleen rests. The days are *geng* and *xin*, the western celestial stems; the hours are *shen* and *you*, the western earthly branches. As Metal, they support Earth, restrain Water, and overcome Wood. In the hours, they assist in autumn, flourish in winter, rest in spring, are imprisoned in Fire, and bloom in summer.\n\nTheir note is *shang*, the sound of Metal. Their sound disperses; it can be sharp to clarify warmth and empty the lungs. Their color is white, the color of Metal and the lungs, like the sound generating color. A withered sound indicates death.\n\nTheir flavor is pungent; its nature is dispersing. Eating it first moves the qi; if consumed hastily or in excess, the skin suffers. Its odor is rank; when heart perversity enters the lungs, one detests rankness.\n\nTheir nature is righteousness, the righteousness of lung qi.

      "translated_text": "The spirit of the lungs is prone to anger, for human anger arises from the lung viscera. To pacify the po-soul and preserve its form, one must gather thoughts and restrain desires, embrace benevolence and nurture righteousness without anger; when angered, do not raise the voice. Calm the Metal qi to preserve life, thus aligning with the Great Harmony.\n\nThe lungs connect with the large intestine and govern the nose above; thus, when wind invades the lungs, the nose becomes congested. A withered complexion indicates dryness of the lungs. An itchy nose suggests the presence of worms within. Excessive fear signifies the po-soul’s departure from the body. A body darkened by fumes reflects weakened lung qi. A loud voice indicates exuberant lung qi. Intolerance of cold and heat signifies lung taxation. A preference for pungent flavors reveals insufficiency of lung qi. Intestinal rumbling arises from lung congestion. A fresh, pale complexion indicates healthy lungs. When lung qi is perverse, the person is prone to weeping.\n\nThe lungs govern illnesses of the *shang* note; one should sigh. Sighing is the qi of the lungs, its nature righteousness, enabling one to recognize lung ailments. Thus, when anger fills the chest, one should exhale deeply to dispel it—this is self-regulation. Without sighing, injury and decay will surely follow. Through sighing and exhalation, wholeness is restored; therefore, lung illnesses require purging through sighing. A person who sighs without cause portends misfortune.\n\nThe lungs reside in the seventh palace, governing trust, fostering uprightness and integrity. Cultivating loyalty first ensures the po-soul’s peace and the body’s wholeness. Moreover, the lungs govern the three months of autumn, a time of balanced countenance. Heaven’s qi grows urgent, earth’s qi becomes clear; sparrows retreat while chickens rise. One’s will should remain tranquil, easing the autumn’s sharpness. Gather and restrain spirit and qi, harmonizing them. Do not let the will stray outward, keeping lung qi pure. This is the principle of nurturing life; violation leads to coughing, snoring, and wheezing.\n\n**Method of Cultivation:**\nRegularly at dawn on the first and fifteenth days of the seventh, eighth, and ninth months, sit facing west. Strike the Heavenly Drum seven times, swallow the Jade Fluid, then close the eyes and compose the mind. Visualize the white qi of the *dui* palace entering the mouth, swallowing it seven times. Hold the breath for seventy cycles. Thus, the spirit becomes profound, the body harmonized, and no evil dares approach. Weapons cannot harm, lifespan extends, and one’s name is inscribed in the register of flying immortals—this is the result of supplementing and purging qi, pacifying breath, and stabilizing the ethereal soul.\n\n**Method for Diagnosing Lung Viscera Illness:**\nWhen the lungs are afflicted with heat, the right cheek reddens. Lung disease manifests as a white complexion with withered hair, wheezing, coughing, counterflow qi, and pain in the chest, back, and limbs. One may dream of beautiful women approaching intimately. Lung deficiency causes shortness of breath, inability to catch one’s breath, dry nose, and parched throat. Lung wind leads to excessive sweating, aversion to wind, frequent coughing that ceases only when qi is exhausted, worsening at dusk. Diagnosis lies above the eyebrows, where the color is white. The lungs govern autumn, and the hand *Taiyin* and *Yangming* channels govern treatment; the days are *geng* and *xin*. If lung qi ascends counterflow, swiftly consume bitter flavors to purge it.\n\nIt is also said: when the lungs are diseased, they desire gathering; consume sour flavors to collect them, use pungent to supplement, and bitter to purge. Avoid cold foods, for the lungs detest cold. In lung disease, symptoms include qi binding the right side of the body at the navel, pain upon pressure, and suffering from coughing—this is heat. To treat lung viscera illness:\n\nFor lung ailments such as nasal congestion, inability to smell fragrance or stench, nasal polyps, sores above, dry and itchy skin, malignant sores, scabies, tinea, counterflow qi, coughing, and spitting of pus and blood, take the *Dispersing Wind Powder*:\n- *Ren Shen* (Ginseng) eight *fen*\n- *Xuan Shen* (Scrophularia) seven *fen*\n- *Fang Feng* (Saposhnikovia) eight *fen*\n- *Sha Shen* (Glehnia) five *fen*\n- *Tian Xiong* (Aconite) eight *fen*\n- *Shu Ye* (Dioscorea leaf) ten *fen*",

      "translated_text": "To treat the heart, use the *he* (exhalation) sound for purging and inhalation for supplementation. The heart is the Fire Palace, located below the lungs and above the liver, opposite one *cun* below the *jiuwei* point. Its color resembles white silk suffused with crimson, and its shape is like a lotus bud yet to bloom. For men, by the age of sixty, the heart’s *qi* declines, leading to frequent slips of the tongue and forgetfulness. It weighs twelve *liang*. The south’s red color enters and connects with the heart, which opens at the tongue and manifests in the pulse, emerging at the *Zhongchong* point.\n\nThe heart is the root of life and the dwelling of the spirit. Moreover, it governs all the viscera, its luminous function generating life. Thus, the heart stores the spirit and serves as the sovereign’s office, from which clarity and insight emerge to oversee the four directions. It is also called the Five Spirit Lords or the Grand Commandant. The heart, as the emperor, resides in the center and is also named the Hall of Light.\n\nThe heart’s external manifestation is the *yi* (sigh) when *qi* causes pain in the heart. Its fluid is sweat, for sweat is the heart’s liquid, just as the kidneys’ fluid is urine. When the heart is in harmony, sweat is moderate; when disordered, sweat is profuse.\n\nThe small intestine is the heart’s bowel, and their pairing forms the receptacle for transformation. The tongue is the heart’s official; when the heart’s *qi* flows freely, the tongue discerns the five flavors. In heart disease, the tongue becomes scorched, curled, and shortened, unable to distinguish flavors. Its paired tissue is the vessels, and its flourishing color is red. When the blood and vessels are deficient and fail to nourish the viscera, the heart’s bowel is the first to perish.\n\nThe heart corresponds to the south’s *Li* Fire. Fire receives *qi* in *hai*, is born in *yin*, flourishes in *wu*, ails in *shen*, dies in *you*, and is entombed in *xu*, ruling summer. The heart flourishes while the spleen assists; the lungs perish, the kidneys are restrained, and the liver rests. The heavenly stems *bing* and *ding* govern the south’s *wu* position, while the earthly branches *chen* and *si* govern the south’s branch positions. Fire supports Wood and restrains Earth; it is strongest in summer and late summer, overcomes Metal, and fears Water. In the four seasons, it is restrained in spring, rests in autumn, and perishes in winter.\n\nIts sound is *zhi*, the tone of Fire, harmonious yet swift. Its color is red, the hue of Fire, resembling the heart of a rooster; if it appears thus, life endures, but if black, death follows. Its flavor is bitter, its nature firm; consuming it first reaches the bones. Those with bone diseases should avoid excessive intake, lest their nails wither. Its associated quality is scorching, for the heart’s malign influences naturally accumulate as heat. Its nature is propriety, governed by joy, the emotion of Fire. Joyful by nature, it governs dryness. The heart corresponds to the Southern Marchmount and connects with the essence of Mars. During the three months of summer, visualize Mars within the heart, or imagine a red *qi* residing there.\n\nThe heart spirit is *Danyuan*, styled *Shouling*.\n\n**Symptoms of Heart Disease:**\nA moving *qi* above the navel, firm and painful to the touch, with heart vexation and distress. In heart disease, the palms and soles of the hands and feet grow hot.\n\n**Methods to Treat Heart Viscus Disease:**\nWhen the heart is afflicted, the mouth becomes dry, the tongue stiff, or the throat sore, making swallowing difficult. Mouth sores may appear, memory fails, and one dreams of forges or smelting. The *Five Ginseng Pill* is suitable:\n- *Qinjiao* (7 *fen*)\n- *Renshen* (7 *fen*)\n- *Xuanshen* (10 *fen*)\n- *Ganjiang* (10 *fen*)\n- *Shashen* (5 *fen*)\n- *Suanzao* (8 *fen*)\n- *Danshen* (8 *fen*)\n- *Kushen* (8 *fen*)\n\nGently draw *qi* through the nose and exhale through the mouth, regulating the breath as above, ensuring no sound reaches the ears before exhaling. For heart disease, perform a deep *he* thirty times and a gentle *he* ten times to dispel heart taxation, heat, and all vexation. When using purgation for heart ailments, cease once the illness is cured; overdoing it will cause harm.\n\n**Dietary Prohibitions:**\nIn the fourth month, avoid garlic, as it causes premature graying and hair loss. In the fifth month, avoid *peng* (a toxic plant), as it harms the heart. Also avoid consuming the heart and kidneys, which induce heart pain. Barley and wheat are suitable, while *huo* (a grain) and salty flavors should be avoided.\n\n**Daoist Breathing Exercises for the Heart Viscus:**\nSit upright, make fists with both hands, and strike forcefully left and right, six times each. Alternatively, sit upright, press one hand on the wrist, and push downward with the other as if lifting a heavy stone. Interlace the fingers, place the feet on the hands, and press five or six times. These methods dispel wind evil and all diseases in the heart and chest. Conclude by visualizing *qi*, holding the breath for an extended period, closing the eyes, swallowing saliva three times, and knocking the teeth together three times.\n\n*Illustration of the Liver Viscus*\n\nTo treat the liver, use the *xu* (exhalation) sound for purging and inhalation for supplementation. The liver is the Wood Palace, located below the heart, slightly to the left, with three lobes. Its color resembles white silk suffused with indigo. For men, by the age of sixty, the liver’s *qi* declines, its lobes thin, the gallbladder shrinks, and vision dims. It weighs four *jin* and four *liang*. The east’s green color enters and connects with the liver, which opens at the eyes—the left eye is *jia*, the right *yi*—and manifests in the sinews. The liver’s pulse emerges at *Dadun*.\n\nThe liver’s color is verdant, resembling overlapping layers. It is the root of endurance and the dwelling of the *hun* soul. The left eye is the sun and the King Father, the right eye the moon and the Queen Mother, the source of tears and the essence of *yin*. The liver is called the Grand Chancellor or the Celestial Minister, residing in the Palace of Clarity.\n\nThe liver generates on the left, and its *qi* governs speech. When *qi* flows freely through the liver, its fluid is tears. When the kidneys’ malign influences invade the liver, tears flow excessively.\n\nThe gallbladder is the liver’s bowel, and their pairing governs the eyes. When the liver’s *qi* flows freely, the eyes see clearly; when the liver is replete, the eyes redden. The liver pairs with the sinews, and its flourishing is in the nails. If the sinews slacken and cannot contract, the liver is the first to perish.\n\nThe liver corresponds to the east’s *Zhen* Wood. Wood receives *qi* in *shen*, dies in *wu*, is born in *hai*, flourishes in *mao*, ails in *si*, and is entombed in *wei*. The liver governs while the heart assists; the spleen perishes, the lungs are restrained, and the kidneys rest. The heavenly stems *jia* and *yi* govern the east’s stem positions, while the earthly branches *yin* and *mao* govern the east’s branch positions. Wood supports Water, restrains Fire, overcomes Earth, and fears Metal. In the four seasons, it assists in winter, flourishes in spring, rests in summer, is restrained in late summer, and perishes in autumn.\n\nIts sound is *jiao*, the tone of Wood. Its color is green, the hue of Wood. Its flavor is sour, its nature flexible; consuming it first reaches the sinews. Those with sinew diseases should avoid excessive intake, lest their nails wither. Its associated quality is rancid, for the liver’s malign influences naturally accumulate as putrefaction. Its nature is benevolence, governed by anger, the emotion of Wood. The liver corresponds to the Eastern Marchmount and connects with Jupiter’s essence. During the three months of spring, visualize Jupiter within the liver, or imagine a green *qi* residing there.\n\nThe liver spirit is *Longyan*, styled *Hanming*.",

      "translated_text": "The sound is *jiao*, the tone of Wood, its resonance descending yet restrained, its harmony tranquil and clear, capable of initially nourishing the liver.\n\nIts color is green, the hue of Wood and the liver; when it resembles the sheen of kingfisher feathers, it signifies vitality, but when it resembles withered grass, it portends death.\n\nIts flavor is sour, its nature astringent; when consumed, it first reaches the sinews. Those with sinew diseases should avoid excessive intake, lest their skin wither and hair fall.\n\nIts nature is benevolence, for the liver’s *qi* governs benevolence, delighting in Wood and the flourishing of life, and thus presiding over joy.\n\nThe liver corresponds to the Eastern Marchmount, connecting above with the essence of Jupiter. During the three months of spring, visualize Jupiter within the liver, or imagine a green *qi* residing there.\n\nThe liver spirit is *Longyan*, styled *Heming*.\n\nNow, the liver is the *qi* of *Zhen* (Thunder) and the essence of Wood. Its form is green, resembling a suspended gourd, and its spirit takes the shape of a green dragon.\n\nThe liver governs the *hun*-soul, which transforms into two jade lads—one clad in green, the other in yellow—each nine inches tall, bearing jade nectar from the liver’s store.\n\nSome say the liver is guarded by three lads and six jade maidens.\n\nIts spirit delights in benevolence, for kindness and grace emanate from the liver’s store. Thus, those who pacify their *hun* and prolong their governance shall see even thorns and brambles receive the dew of mercy.\n\nIt governs the sinews; when the liver is deficient, the sinews contract. When a person’s skin withers, it is due to heat in the liver; when their flesh bears speckles, it is liver-wind; when their complexion is green, the liver is in excess; when they crave sour foods, the liver is insufficient; when their hair withers, the liver is damaged; when their hands and feet sweat excessively, it is not an illness. If lung-pathogens invade the liver, they cause frequent weeping.\n\nThe liver governs the sinews, and when the liver is afflicted, one should employ *xu*. *Xu* is the liver’s *qi*, its nature benevolent, capable of dispelling pain and decay—all natural confirmations. Is it not *xu* that accomplishes this? Such is the profound and mysterious Dao of utmost principle.\n\nThe liver resides in the third palace, governing benevolence, fostering solemnity, kindness, and grace. When it extends to others, the *hun* is at peace and the form is whole.\n\nTo engage the liver is to act in spring’s three months, when heaven and earth’s *qi* quickens, and all things flourish—flowers bloom in profusion, leaves luxuriate, and the *qi* of benevolence first sprouts. Rise early and retire late, stroll leisurely in the courtyard, loosen your hair and relax your form to nurture the will. Give life and do not kill, bestow and do not seize, reward and do not punish—this is the Dao of nurturing life in spring. To contravene it injures the liver, causing hair and skin to lose their luster, inviting cold, and diminishing the capacity to sustain life.\n\n**Cultivation Method:**\nRegularly, on the first day of the first, second, and third months, sit facing east at dawn, click the teeth three times, hold the breath for ninety cycles, and inhale the green *qi* of the *Zhen* Palace into the mouth, swallowing it nine times to replenish deficiency and damage. Partake of the Green Dragon’s essence to sate the hunger of the two lads. When Wood’s essence rides Earth, joy abounds and sorrow diminishes—such is the subtlety of nurturing essence.\n\n**Diagnosing Liver Diseases:**\nWhen the liver is hot, the left eye reddens.\nWhen the liver is diseased, the eyelashes droop, the lower eyelids ache, and pain radiates to the lower abdomen, causing frequent anger.\nWhen the liver is deficient, one feels fearful, as if about to be seized.\nWhen the liver is in excess, one is prone to rage; when deficient, one feels cold.\nWhen *yin* *qi* is robust, one dreams of mountains, trees, gardens, and sprouting grasses—signs of the liver’s *qi* flowing freely.\nHeadaches, deafness, swollen cheeks, aversion to wind, frequent anger, and blurred vision manifest in the eyes, with a greenish complexion.\n\nIt is also said that liver diseases prevail in spring, with the Foot *Jueyin* and Foot *Shaoyang* as exterior-interior pair, governing treatment. The days are *jia-yi*, and if the liver is tense, consume sweet flavors to relax it.\n\nFurther, when the liver is diseased and desires dispersion, swiftly consume pungent flavors to disperse it; use salty flavors to tonify and pungent flavors to purge. Avoid wind, for the liver detests it.\n\n**Liver’s Inhalation-Exhalation Method:**\nGently draw in *qi* through the nose and exhale through the mouth with *xu*.\nFor liver diseases, perform a deep *xu* thirty times and a gentle *xu* ten times to dispel deficiency-heat from the liver and eliminate stiffness and dimness in the four limbs.\nFor all heat conditions, repeatedly perform *xu* in a continuous, unbroken manner for optimal effect. Cease when the disease is alleviated; excessive practice may cause harm.\n\n**Foods to Avoid When Raw:**\nIn the first month, do not consume raw scallions—those with heat should especially avoid them.\nIn the second and third months, avoid garlic bulbs, knotweed seeds, and the hearts of all herbs; do not eat liver or lungs. Consume sesame seeds, *jugengzi*, and plums.\nAvoid pungent flavors.\n\n**Dao-Yin Method**",

      "translated_text": "**Dao-Yin Method (continued):**\nOne may sit upright, place both hands one over the other beneath the ribs, and slowly bend the body to the left and right, three to five times each side. Alternatively, sit upright, clasp the hands, interlock the fingers, and turn them outward toward the chest three to five times—this dispels accumulations, wind, and pathogenic *qi* from the liver. The rest follows as above.\n\n**Illustrated Diagram of the Five Viscera and Six Bowels from the *Huangting Neijing*:**\n**Spleen Viscus Diagram**\nTo treat the spleen, use *hu* (exhalation) for purgation and *xi* (inhalation) for supplementation. The spleen is the Earth Palace, governing the Great Granary, located three *cun* above the navel, its color like white silk suffused with yellow.\n\nBy the time a man reaches seventy, the spleen’s *qi* becomes deficient, and his skin withers and emaciates. It weighs two *jin* and three *liang*, its central hue yellow. It connects internally to the mouth—the mouth corresponds to *wu* and *ji*, the tongue to *ji*. In form, it is the spleen; in pulse, it emerges as the hidden. The spleen is the pivot of the five viscera.\n\nThe spleen is the root of flesh and the seat of intention. It is the Yellow Court, the Central Lord, the Yellow Dragon Sovereign, the Remonstrating Minister, the Granary Officer, and the Transformer of Things—styled the Central Yellow Palace. The spleen governs the center, harmonizing the valley *qi*; its fluid is saliva. When kidney pathogens invade the spleen, excessive drooling occurs.\n\nThe six bowels: the stomach is the granary of the five grains, paired with the spleen as the Grain Palace. The five officials: the mouth is the spleen’s official. When spleen *qi* flows freely, the mouth discerns the five flavors; when the spleen is diseased, the mouth becomes dry, unable to eat, and loses taste for flavors. The spleen governs flesh; when flesh withers, emaciation follows, and one cannot grow plump. The spleen’s paired tissue is muscle. When the spleen dies first, it is due to its central Earth position.\n\nIt receives *qi* at *ji*, flourishes at *zi*, ails at *hai*, dies at *mao*, and is buried at *chen*. Its season is late summer; the spleen reigns, the lung assists, the kidney declines, the liver is imprisoned, and the heart rests. Its heavenly stem is *wu-ji* (central), its earthly branch *chen-xu-chou-wei* (central). Its element is Earth. In late summer, it is in its prime; in autumn, it rests; in winter, it is imprisoned; in spring, it dies. Earth supports Fire, restrains Metal, overcomes Water, and fears Wood—they interact in mutual balance.\n\nIts note is *gong*, the sound of Earth, which expresses harmony and breadth, embodying the spleen’s gentle strength. Its color is yellow, the hue of Earth and the spleen. If it resembles a crab’s belly, life persists; if it resembles the fruit of the *zhishi* tree, death follows. Its flavor is sweet, its nature moderate. When consumed, it first travels to the flesh; those with flesh ailments should not eat much, for excess harms the bones and causes hair loss. Its scent is fragrant; if heart pathogens invade the spleen, one detests fragrance.\n\nIts nature is trustworthiness. The spleen governs speech and fidelity; its emotion is fear, for Earth’s nature is to master fear. Externally, the spleen corresponds to the Central Marchmount and connects above to the essence of Saturn. During late summer and the last eighteen days of each season, visualize Saturn within the spleen, or meditate on yellow *qi*.\n\nThe spleen spirit is ever-present, named *Hunting*. The spleen is the *qi* of *kun* (Earth) and the essence of soil. Its color is yellow, its form like an overturned vessel, its spirit resembling a phoenix. The spleen’s intention transforms into a jade maiden, seven *cun* in length, circulating within the spleen viscus.\n\nIts spirit is fierce and jealous of others’ prosperity. When one prospers, it arises from the spleen’s envy. Earth has no fixed form, hence no constancy. Women’s envy is particularly strong, as it rides upon yin. To pacify intention, one must reduce desires and limit sensual indulgence. Diminish thoughts, quiet concerns, cultivate Earth’s virtue, and thereby preserve life—this aligns with the Great Yin.\n\nThe spleen connects to the stomach, governs the mouth above, and is the granary that digests grain, like a millstone turning, transforming the raw into the cooked. Undigested food results from the spleen’s failure to turn; hard foods that the spleen cannot fully grind become food stagnation. Thus, when the viscera are disharmonious, the constitution is harmed; when the constitution is harmed, the spirit is diminished, and the person is swiftly injured.\n\nTherefore, avoiding hard foods is the subtle path to preserving the body. Those who lose their appetite have undigested food in the spleen; those prone to confusion have an unsettled spleen viscus. Excessive eating indicates spleen deficiency; difficulty swallowing signals spleen cold; pallor reveals spleen damage. A preference for sweet foods indicates spleen insufficiency; a bright, lustrous complexion shows the spleen is healthy.\n\nWhen spleen pathogens invade the spleen, one sings excessively. As the spleen is the Earth Palace, its ailments should be treated with *hu* (exhalation). *Hu* is the spleen’s *qi*, and its force can dispel the spleen’s illnesses. Those with internal heat should use *hu* to expel dampness.\n\nThe spleen governs the *gong* note and trustworthiness, fostering broad-mindedness, humility, and benefiting others. It values restraint in profit, refrains from self-aggrandizement, and avoids contention over wealth—thus the spleen is at peace and the body whole. Moreover, the spleen has no fixed position; it flourishes in all four seasons, following the four *qi*. Assisting the *qi* of all things, it nurtures yang—this is the spleen’s righteous path. It does not seek virtue in monthly submission nor merit in material allure. This is the principle of *kun* (Earth). To act contrary harms the spleen.\n\n**Cultivation Method:**\nDuring the first day of late summer and the eighteenth day of each seasonal transition at dawn, sit in the Central Palace. Hold the breath for five cycles, strike the Heavenly Drum twelve times, and inhale the yellow *qi* of the *kun* Palace into the mouth, swallowing twelve times to replenish the depletion caused by *hu*. Drink the Jade Liquor Elixir to attain the flavor of the divine phoenix, thereby supplementing the spleen and aiding the spirit. One who practices this *qi*-restraining Earth essence will enter mountains unafraid of tigers and wolves, and traverse perilous paths without fear of stumbling.\n\n**Diagnostic Method:**\nIf the spleen is red, the nose is red; if the color is yellow and moist, the nose is likewise. In illness, wandering wind moves across the body, causing generalized heaviness, dull pain, and muscle atrophy, rendering the feet unable to walk. One favors singing, and the soles of the feet ache. Spleen deficiency leads to abdominal distension and rumbling, dysentery, and undigested food.",

This dispels accumulations, gatherings, and wind evil in the spleen viscus, and stimulates the appetite.\n\n**Illustration of the Five Viscera and Six Bowels from the *Huangting Neijing*:**\n**Kidney Viscus Diagram**\nFor the kidneys, use *chui* (blowing). Blowing serves as purgation; inhalation serves as supplementation.\n\nThe kidneys are the Water Palace, situated with the left kidney to the left and the right kidney to the right, positioned anteriorly opposite the navel and adhering to the spine. Their color resembles white silk suffused with purple. Generally, by the time a man reaches sixty, kidney *qi* declines, causing hair loss and tooth decay. As *qi* wanes, the meridians become desiccated and hollow. At seventy, the body’s form reaches its limit; at ninety, it resembles a tree with roots. The kidneys weigh two *jin* and two *liang*.\n\nThe north corresponds to black, entering and communicating with the kidneys, which open at the two yin orifices. The left kidney is *ren*; the right kidney is *gui*. In form, they govern the bones. Prolonged standing injures the bones. The kidney meridian emerges at *Yongquan* (Bubbling Spring).\n\nThe kidneys are the root of the viscus and the repository of essence. They serve as the Rear Palace and the female sovereign. The kidney meridian traverses the upper burner, flourishes in the middle burner, and defends in the lower burner. The kidneys are the official of strength and skill, from which ingenuity arises. They follow the patterns of images, governing principle and enduring stability. Their surplus *qi* communicates with the two orifices, manifesting as fluids and saliva. Saliva is a fluid; when *qi* enters the kidneys, saliva increases.\n\nThe bladder is the bowel of the kidneys, and together they form the bowel of fluid and jubilation. The ears are the officials of the kidneys; when kidney *qi* flows unimpeded, one hears the five notes. Kidney disease results in deafness and bone atrophy. The kidneys unite with the bones, and their flourishing is reflected in the hair. When bones atrophy and one cannot rise from bed, kidney *qi* has perished first—this serves as the standard.\n\nThe kidneys correspond to the north, the *kan* trigram, and Water. Water receives *qi* at *si*, is born at *shen*, flourishes at *zi*, ails at *yin*, dies at *mao*, and is entombed at *chen*. In winter, the kidneys flourish; the liver and heart die, the spleen is imprisoned, and the lungs rest. The days are *ren* and *gui*, the northern celestial stems; the hours are *hai* and *zi*, the northern earthly branches. Water supports Wood and generates Metal, restrains Water and overcomes Fire, fears Earth, is ministerial in autumn, flourishes in winter, rests in spring, is imprisoned in summer, and dies in late summer.\n\nIts sound is *yu* (feather), the tone of Water—deep and hollow, harmonious yet brief, dispersing and capable of movement. Its color is black, the hue of the kidneys. If it resembles a crow’s feather, one lives; if it resembles soot, one dies. Its flavor is salty; excessive consumption depletes the blood, so those with blood disorders should avoid it. Overindulgence causes the vessels to overflow and alters the complexion. Its odor is putrid; when pathogenic *qi* enters the kidneys, one detests putridity.\n\nIts nature is wisdom; the kidneys govern intelligence, and their affairs are sorrow, for Water’s nature is inherently sorrowful. Externally, the kidneys correspond to the Northern Marchmount, and above they communicate with the essence of the *Chen* (Mercury) star. During the three months of winter, visualize the *Chen* star within the kidneys, or store black *qi* therein.\n\nThe kidney spirit is *Qu Ming*, styled *Yu Ying*. The kidneys are the *qi* of *kan*, the essence of Water. Their color is black, their form resembles suspended stone, and their spirit resembles a two-headed deer. They govern intelligence and transform into a jade youth, one *chi* in length.\n\nWhen the kidney’s spirit is harmonious, one becomes gentle and compliant. Only after its arrival can life be preserved, aligning with the Great Clarity. The kidneys unite with the bones and govern the teeth above. Tooth pain indicates kidney damage. They also govern the ears; deafness arises from kidney deficiency. Bone pain stems from kidney vacuity. Frequent gum bleeding results from kidney vacuity. Tooth erosion is kidney wind. Ear pain is kidney *qi* congestion. Frequent yawning is kidney evil. Inability to straighten the waist is kidney freezing. A yellow-black complexion indicates kidney decline. A purple, radiant complexion in the kidneys portends no suffering. Bone creaking signifies kidney emaciation. When lung evil invades the kidneys, stretching increases.\n\nThe kidneys govern *yu* (feather), so kidney disease requires *chui* (blowing). Kidney *qi* is wise and can dispel kidney ailments. Thus, when accumulated *qi* surges into the chest, forcefully blowing kidney *qi* clears stagnation. Gentle blowing subtly unblocks it.\n\nThe kidneys reside in one palace, governing intelligence. They make one astute and agile, with a clear and unobstructed spirit, ensuring stability and bodily integrity. Moreover, the kidneys serve winter’s function. As *qi* closes between heaven and earth, the myriad things lie hidden. One retires at *xu* and rises at *yin*, aligning with profound yin. Externally yin and internally yang, they nourish the bones and tranquilize the spirit. Acting contrary injures the kidneys.\n\n**Cultivation Method:**\nRegularly during the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth months, face northwest and strike the *Jin Liang* (Metal Beam) ten times. Drink three mouthfuls of jade spring water, then inhale the black *qi* of the *Xuan Gong* (Mysterious Palace) into the mouth, swallowing it five times to supplement the flavor lost through blowing. Feed on the sustenance of white deer and prepare the compositions of jade youths. Harmonize the *qi* of the stalk and sing the breath; when spirit and body are at peace, no malevolent forces can harm you, and longevity is attained.\n\n**Diagnosing Kidney Viscus Disease:**\nWhen the kidneys are hot, the cheeks redden. Kidney disease manifests as a black complexion, withered teeth, abdominal distension, heaviness of the body, panting, coughing, sweating, and aversion to wind. Kidney disease causes pain in the lumbar region; wind induces frequent fear of drafts. Food and drink fail to descend, the diaphragm is cold and obstructed, the abdomen is full. Removing clothing causes abdominal distension; consuming cold induces diarrhea. The form is black and emaciated, yet the abdomen is large.\n\nFurthermore, the kidneys govern winter, and the Foot Lesser Yin and Greater Yang meridians govern their treatment. Their celestial stems are *ren* and *gui*. The kidneys suffer from dryness; urgently consume acrid flavors to moisten them and facilitate the flow of fluid *qi*. For kidney firmness and disease, urgently consume bitter flavors to weaken them. Use bitter to purge and salty to supplement. Avoid violating hot foods and warm clothing to prevent kidney dryness.\n\n**Kidney Disease Patterns:**\nIn kidney disease, there is moving *qi* below the navel. Pressing it resembles taxation disease, with suffering from undigested food in the abdomen, heaviness of the body, pain in the bones and joints, and external cravings.",

      "translated_text": "Thus, Heaven possesses the Five Phases to generate cold, heat, dryness, and dampness, while humans possess the five *qi* to engender joy, anger, sorrow, anxiety, and fear. Joy and anger harm the *qi*; cold and heat harm the form. When joy and anger are unchecked and cold and heat exceed their bounds, life is no longer preserved. If one can nurture life in accordance with the seasons, one may avoid the afflictions of Heaven.\n\nThe eyes should not gaze recklessly, the mouth should not speak recklessly, the ears should not listen recklessly, and the nose should not smell recklessly—these are the wondrous methods of nurturing life. Often rub the hands together until warm, then wipe the face twenty-one times, and likewise rub the entire body until thoroughly warmed. This is called \"dry bathing,\" which dispels misfortune and ensures the face shines with jade-like luster and golden radiance.\n\nMoreover, the five viscera, when augmented by the gallbladder, are called the six bowels. The gallbladder also receives the *qi* of Water and shares the Dao with *Kan* (the trigram ☵), so it cannot be categorized with the other bowels, hence a separate illustration of the gallbladder is provided.\n\nTo treat the gallbladder, use the *xi* (嘻) sound: *xi* is for purging, inhalation is for supplementation. The gallbladder adheres to the liver, its color like white silk veiled in blue, weighing three *liang* and three *zhu*. The gallbladder is the \"blue-green palace\" within, known as the General and the Deciding Official. It can be resolute yet gentle, its essence manifesting as the soaring serpent, embodying courage and vigor.\n\nThe gallbladder corresponds to the sinews and is the essence of the six bowels. It is the organ of central rectitude, where judgments are made. The gallbladder spirit is named Longyao, styled Weiwen.\n\nThe gallbladder is the essence of Metal and the color of Water; its hue is blue-green, its form like a suspended gourd. Its spirit resembles a tortoise and serpent, transforming into a jade youth, one foot in length, wielding a halberd, darting in and out of the gallbladder’s domain. Those with bold decisiveness owe it to the gallbladder’s influence.\n\nTo pacify its spirit, one must cease anger and embrace righteousness, thereby preserving life and harmonizing with Heaven’s great harmony. The gallbladder pairs with the bladder and governs the hair above. Thus, withered hair signifies gallbladder depletion; brittle nails, gallbladder deficiency; dry hair, gallbladder wind; scorched hair, gallbladder heat; dull eyes or tearing, gallbladder heat. A preference for bitter flavors indicates gallbladder insufficiency. A blue-green or lustrous white complexion signals a healthy gallbladder.\n\nThe gallbladder resides in the *Kan* palace, inspiring reverence for wisdom, admiration for virtue, rejection of deceit, and avoidance of flattery, embodying uprightness. The gallbladder is born of Metal, and Metal governs martiality, hence its boldness—yet it should be tempered for auspiciousness.\n\nThe gallbladder rides the *qi* of Yin and employs the function of Metal, thus governing desire. Desire breeds sorrow: as Metal is born of Water, tears fall from the eyes. The heart governs Fire, the gallbladder governs Water and bitterness. Fire is extinguished by Water, Water is boiled by Fire; when Yin and Yang contend, Water and gallbladder prevail over Fire, so tears flow from the eyes. Tears are akin to their source, hence their name. In sorrowful wailing, one may utter bitter words. The gallbladder is Water yet governs Yang; Yin follows Yang, so tears emerge from the eyes.\n\n**Methods of Cultivation**\nDuring the three months of winter, sit upright in pure contemplation. Inhale the black *qi* of the Northern Palace through the mouth, swallowing it thrice to replenish the depletion caused by *xi*, to fully benefit the gallbladder’s fluids. Consume the flavors of tortoise and serpent, drink the nectar of the jade youth, and the spirit will surge, the body harmonize. No evil can assail, no thief approach—such is the power of gallbladder *qi*.\n\n**Diagnosing Illness**\nWhen the gallbladder is afflicted, one sighs deeply, tastes bitterness, vomits undigested fluids, and feels a constant unease, as if fearing capture. The brows droop, the eyebrows wither. If the gallbladder is excessively replete, it generates heat, causing the spirit to wander and sleep to be restless. If deficient, it generates cold, inducing fear, dizziness, and an inability to sleep alone. Deficiency leads to brittle nails, dry hair, tearing eyes, and pain in the bladder, lower back, and lower abdomen.\n\nThe gallbladder shares a pathway with the liver; treat its ailments with liver viscera methods.\n\n**Dao-Yin Exercises**\nSit upright, raise the soles of the feet, tilt the head back, grasp the ankles with both hands, and shake three to five times. Alternatively, sit with legs extended, press the hands to the ground, lift the body, and stretch the spine three to five times. These methods dispel wind-poison and evil *qi* from the kidneys.\n\n**Breathing Techniques**\nGently draw in *qi* through the nose and expel it with the *xi* sound. For gallbladder and kidney ailments—including all cold Yin sweats, night sweats, pallor, lower abdominal distension, cold pain below the navel—urgently dispel them. For dry mouth, bitter tongue, repeatedly use *xi* to cure the illness.\n\n**Illustration of the Yellow Court’s Inner Radiance: The Five Viscera and Six Bowels**\n*Comprehensive Text and Illustrations of the Five Viscera*",

      "translated_text": "The Yellow Emperor addressed Qi Bo, saying: \"Man is born by receiving the *qi* of Heaven and Earth. That which comes is called *essence*; the encounter of essence is called *spirit*; the emanation of spirit is called *divine*; the transformation of the divine is called *hun*. The *hun* follows the divine in its comings and goings, called *awareness*; the *essence* enters and exits in tandem, called *po*, which governs flourishing. The accumulation of *hun* forms the *heart*. The heart’s inclinations are called *emotions*; emotions with attachment are called *intent*; the direction of intent is called *will*; the recollection of will is called *thought*; the distant longing of thought is called *contemplation*; the fruition of contemplation in affairs is called *wisdom*. Wisdom encompasses all these manifestations—thus the functions of accumulated *divine*, *hun*, *po*, *intent*, *emotions*, *wisdom*, *awareness*, and *perception* are complete.\"\n\nScholar Sun Simiao remarked: \"Man is endowed by Heaven and Earth, thus internally possessing the five viscera, six bowels, *essence* and *qi*, bones and marrow, sinews and vessels; externally uniting the four limbs, nine orifices, skin and hair, nails and teeth, throat, lips and tongue, the gate of the womb, and the urinary bladder—all together forming the body. When nurturing and rest are properly regulated, the body remains at peace and functions harmoniously; if improper, the five taxations, seven injuries, and six exhaustions arise. Yet with proper methods, these can be remedied, and though illness may strike, no grave harm follows. Thus, within these illustrations, the five viscera and six bowels are fully described—the blood and vessels like springs, circulating and flowing, corresponding with the nine orifices in their meeting places, all exhaustively detailed here. Those who devote themselves to this practice, even in old age, will find no internal ailment afflicting them.\n\nThe hair should be frequently combed, the teeth often clicked, the saliva regularly swallowed, the *qi* constantly refined, and the *essence* perpetually preserved. These five practices are what is meant by 'if one wishes not to die, cultivate the Kunlun.' It is akin to refining the elixir to secure it, abstaining from grains to sustain it. When these methods are mastered, one records them in golden tablets and faces the heavens, drawing in the *qi* of the sun and ascending to emptiness—such are the arts of the adept.\n\nThe *Original Beginning of the Great Mystery Classic* states: 'Joy and anger harm the nature; excessive pleasure harms the spirit. When nature is harmed, life is endangered. Thus, nurture the nature to preserve the *qi*, guard the spirit to stabilize the body. When *qi* is whole, the body is balanced; when the heart is at peace, the spirit is at ease—this is the secret to preserving life.'\"\n\n*Illustrated and Comprehensive Record of the Five Viscera from the* Ten Books of Daoist Cultivation: *The Yellow Court’s Inner Radiance, Five Viscera and Six Bowels, Scroll Fifty-Four—Concluded.*",
