  "full_translation": "**The Supreme Mysterious Numinous Northern Dipper Original Destiny Longevity True Scripture**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Supreme Mysterious Numinous Northern Dipper Original Destiny Longevity True Scripture*. The author is unknown, approximately dating to the early Northern Song dynasty. It falsely attributes its transmission to the Supreme Lord Lao, who in Shu Prefecture bestowed it upon the Celestial Master Zhang Daoling of the Han, expounding upon the rituals of offering to the Northern Dipper’s Seven Primordial Lords for the remission of sins and the invocation of blessings. One scroll.\n\n**Source of Base Text:** *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Section of Divine Writings*, *Category of Original Texts*.\n\n---\n\n**The Supreme Mysterious Numinous Northern Dipper Original Destiny Longevity True Scripture**\n\nAt that time, the Supreme Lord Lao, on the seventh day of the first month in the first year of *Yongshou*, was upon the Terrace of Grand Clarity within the Palace of the Supreme Ultimate. Gazing upon sentient beings adrift for kalpas, endlessly revolving through birth and death—some dwelling in the human realm, born within the Central Kingdom, others among the barbarian tribes of the east or the wild tribes of the west; some wealthy, some noble, some base, some poor—all transient in their karmic conditions, they fell into hell, bound by their indeterminate fate. Their sins and karma entangled them, their souls shackled to the nether courts, suffering until their term was fulfilled. Departing the human way, they were reborn among beasts or as birds and insects, estranged from humanity, scarcely able to regain a human form. Thus they sank, unaware, for in past lives they had strayed from the true Dao, enduring this cycle of rebirth.\n\nMoved by compassion, the Lord divided his form to teach and transform, descending in manifestation to the capital of Shu. The earth spirits surged forth, raising a jade platform to serve as a lofty seat.\n\nThereupon, the Lord ascended the jade platform and bestowed upon the Celestial Master the esoteric instructions of the *Northern Dipper Original Destiny Scripture*, broadly proclaiming its essential methods to universally deliver sentient beings.\n\nAt that moment, the Lord addressed the Celestial Master, saying: \"The human body is difficult to obtain; birth in the Central Kingdom is rare. Even if one attains it, encountering the true Dharma is hard. Many stray from the true Dao, entering heterodox sects; many plant the roots of sin; many indulge in cunning and deceit; many give rein to lust and killing; many delight in crowds and passions; many yield to greed and wrath; many sink into hell; many lose their human form. For such reasons, sentient beings remain deluded, unaware of the true Dao, and the confused are many.\n\nI now, grieving at the sight of these beings, descend this Dharma teaching to expound the good causes, that they may know the Dao, understand that body and life essence all arise from the Dao. Comprehending this principle, they may abide long in the human way, their lineage unbroken, generation after generation as humans, never born in lands devoid of the Dao, never severed from the root of humanity. Further, if they cultivate the true Dao in their hearts, they may gradually enter the lineage of immortals, forever escaping the cycle of rebirth, transcending to attain the Dao. Thus I reveal to you this wondrous method, that you may deliver the people of heaven to return to the truth and know their destiny.\n\nOn the day of one’s original destiny, one may perform purification rites and establish an altar, invoking the Northern Dipper, the Three Officials, the Five Emperors, the Nine Bureaus, and the Four Administrations, offering prayers for blessings and the dissolution of calamities. Submit memorials with earnest vows, reverently presenting offerings—various incense and flowers, seasonal fruits, and the proper ritual observances. Establish a pure altar, modeling heaven and earth, whether in a temple or at home, contributing according to one’s means. Conduct the ritual, for the merit is profound and cannot be fully described. Recite the names of the Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Primordial Lords, and one’s sins shall be eradicated, misfortunes washed away, blessings and longevity bestowed upon one’s life, and good fruits gathered to one’s person. In times of urgent peril, one may burn incense and recite the scripture to secure peace within the appointed time.\"\n\nThereupon, the efficacy of the Great Sage Northern Dipper in resolving calamities is proclaimed:\n\nThe Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Primordial Lords can resolve the three disasters,\nThe Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Primordial Lords can resolve the four deadly perils,\nThe Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Primordial Lords can resolve the five-phase calamities,\nThe Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Primordial Lords can resolve the six harms,\nThe Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Primordial Lords can resolve the seven injuries,\nThe Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Primordial Lords can resolve the eight difficulties,\nThe Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Primordial Lords can resolve the nine-star calamities,\nThe Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Primordial Lords can resolve the calamities of husband and wife,\nThe Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Primordial Lords can resolve the calamities of men and women,\nThe Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Primordial Lords can resolve the calamities of childbirth,\nThe Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Primordial Lords can resolve the calamities of repeated misfortune,\nThe Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Primordial Lords can resolve the calamities of epidemics,\nThe Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Primordial Lords can resolve the calamities of illness,\nThe Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Primordial Lords can resolve the calamities of malevolent spirits,\nThe Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Primordial Lords can resolve the calamities of tigers and wolves,\nThe Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Primordial Lords can resolve the calamities of insects and snakes,\nThe Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Primordial Lords can resolve the calamities of bandits and robbers,\nThe Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Primordial Lords can resolve the calamities of cangues and cudgels,\nThe Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Primordial Lords can resolve the calamities of unnatural death,\nThe Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Primordial Lords can resolve the calamities of curses and oaths,\nThe Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Primordial Lords can resolve the calamities of heavenly nets,\nThe Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Primordial Lords can resolve the calamities of earthly snares,\nThe Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Primordial Lords can resolve the calamities of blades and warfare,\nThe Great Sage Northern Dipper’s Seven Primordial Lords can resolve the calamities of water and fire.\n\nThereupon, the Seven Primordial Lords, the Great Sages, are numinously efficacious.\nThey deliver from all calamities and hardships, lifting sentient beings from suffering.\nIf one makes urgent supplication, recitation ensures peace and tranquility.\nAll depends on the generation of a hundred blessings, all harmonizing with the five phases.\nThe three *hun* souls are secure and healthy; malevolent spirits cannot linger.\nTrue *qi* descends from the five directions; myriad blessings naturally converge.\nLongevity transcends the eight difficulties, all through reverence for the seven stars.\nLife after life, the body is at ease; generation after generation, the spirit remains pure.\nGoodness is like a reflection in light; response is like an echo in a valley.\nThe Three Primordials and the spirits together protect; the myriad sages share the same luminous gaze.\nNo disasters, no obstructions—forever preserving the tranquility of the Daoist heart.\n\nThe Lord Lao said: \"The Northern Asterism hangs as a celestial image, and the myriad stars pay it homage. It is the pivot of creation, the master of human spirits, proclaiming its might across the three realms, governing the ten thousand numina. It judges the span of good and evil in the human world, oversees the right and wrong of the nether courts. The five phases share its mandate; the seven luminaries follow its course. It possesses the power to reverse death and inscribe life, to dissolve calamities and deliver from hardship. From emperors above to commoners below, though their stations differ, their destinies are without distinction.\"\n\nThe common folk in the world are often lost and deluded, unaware that their bodies belong to the Northern Dipper and their lives are governed by the Celestial Treasury. When disasters and misfortunes strike, they know not the gate of absolution; when they pray for blessings and longevity, they remain ignorant of the path to return to truth. Thus, their souls are assailed, and calamities cling to them. Some suffer from chronic illness, others are afflicted by malevolent spirits, languishing for years in distress, entangled in misfortune for ages. Lawsuits and summonses arise, ancestral spirits are implicated, or heavenly reprimands descend, or vengeful ghosts lodge false accusations. When such perils arise, how may one seek deliverance? One must urgently petition the Northern Dipper, offer rites of gratitude to the Perfected Lords, and recite the true scriptures, recognizing the Perfected Lord of one’s own destiny—only then may one attain peace and prosperity, even flourishing in health and honor. There are yet deeper mysteries that cannot be fully expounded.\n\nWhenever one beholds the true form of the Northern Dipper, one must bow in reverence and pay homage. The first star, Yang Brightness, the Greedy Wolf Great Star Lord, governs those born in the year of the Rat. The second star, Yin Essence, the Great Gate Primordial Star Lord, governs those born in the years of the Ox and Pig. The third star, Perfected Human, the Emolument-Store True Star Lord, governs those born in the years of the Tiger and Dog. The fourth star, Mysterious Darkness, the Literary Curved Binding Star Lord, governs those born in the years of the Rabbit and Rooster. The fifth star, Cinnabar Prime, the Upright Integrity Network Star Lord, governs those born in the years of the Dragon and Monkey. The sixth star, Northern Culmen, the Martial Curved Chronicle Star Lord, governs those born in the years of the Snake and Sheep. The seventh star, Celestial Pass, the Broken Army Pass Star Lord, governs those born in the year of the Horse. The eighth star is the Cavern Brightness Outer Auxiliary Star Lord, and the ninth is the Hidden Light Inner Assistant Star Lord. The Upper Terrace is the Void Essence Opening Virtue Star Lord, the Middle Terrace is the Sixfold Purity Controller of Emptiness Star Lord, and the Lower Terrace is the Curved Life Controller of Emolument Star Lord. These are the names and titles of the Perfected Lords, which one may rarely hear. Yet whoever hears and upholds them is one of profound Daoist devotion, blessed with good karmic affinity from past lives. To hear and recite them brings merit and power beyond measure.\n\nIf devout men and women of true faith encounter this true scripture, their wisdom-nature will become complete, their Daoist heart will unfold, they will emerge from the paths of delusion, enter the Gate of the Subtle and Inaudible, return to the true lineage, and attain the realm of flourishing life. On the days of the Three Primes, the Eight Festivals, one’s destiny-day, birthday, or the day beneath the Northern Dipper, one should meticulously prepare an altar, recite the scriptures, hold fasts and offer rites, and perform the Daoist liturgy according to the proper forms. The blessings thus accrued will be boundless, spanning lives across generations, never straying from true nature, never falling into heterodox views. Those who uphold this scripture should constantly recite the honored names of the Seven Perfected Lords of the Northern Dipper. When their virtuous merit is complete, auspicious signs will descend.\n\nThe Northern Dipper Incantation is as follows:\nNorthern Dipper of Nine Stars, great deities of the central heavens,\nAbove they ascend to the Golden Gates, below they cover Kunlun.\nThey regulate the cosmic order, govern the cosmos and earth.\nGreat Dipper and Greedy Wolf, Great Gate and Emolument-Store,\nLiterary Curved and Upright Integrity, Martial Curved and Broken Army.\nSupreme Jade Emperor, Purple Tenuity Emperor Lord,\nEncompassing the great celestial realm, penetrating even the tiniest dust.\nWhat disaster cannot be eradicated? What blessing cannot be attained?\nPrime imperial qi, come and merge with my body.\nWherever the Celestial Pivot points, it turns day and night without cease.\nThe common folk, though humble, seek the Dao and yearn for numinous power.\nMay they behold your honored form and forever preserve long life.\nThe Three Terraces of Void Essence, the Sixfold Purity of Curved Life,\nThey give me life, nurture me, and protect my form.\n[...] honored Emperor of the Dipper, swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!\n\nLord Lao said: \"The five constituents of human nature and life all fall under the governance of the Star Official of one’s destiny. The spirit-generals of one’s destiny and the stellar officials of one’s natal constellation constantly bestow their protection, sustaining one’s life and preserving one’s allotted years. Yet the common folk, ignorant and unenlightened, remain unaware throughout their lives. The Perfected Official of one’s destiny descends to the human realm six times each year, and the day of descent is one’s destiny-day. During the limit-period, thirty thousand Southern Mound Envoys and seventy thousand spirit-generals of the Northern Dipper accompany the Perfected Official of one’s destiny in their descent, with all the Perfected Ones gathering to offer protection. This is the time to dissolve disasters, repent of sins, pray for blessings, and extend life. According to one’s means, one may perform rites and fasts, thereby augmenting one’s fortune and virtue.\n\nIf the limit-period of one’s destiny is approaching and one remains unaware, failing to prepare fasts and rites or maintain incense offerings, this is to treat life with contempt, to be deluded about one’s origin, and to disregard the value of human existence. The celestial authorities will revoke one’s emoluments, reduce one’s allotted years, and curtail one’s lifespan, often leading to premature death. Those who err in this way, even if they encounter the scriptural instructions, harbor disbelief, slander the true text, and thus, after their bodies perish, they will sink into the Three Wretched Realms, drift through the various destinies, and forever lose human form. How tragic and pitiable it is that they bring such suffering upon themselves!\n\nIf, on one’s destiny-day, one can perform fasts and rites, and sincerely communicate with the celestial authorities, reciting the true scriptures during the limit-period of one’s destiny, and broadly presenting offerings, then for three lifetimes one will always be reborn as a man, wealthy, noble, intelligent, and preeminent among humanity. Even if one’s karmic endowment in this life is meager, leaving one poor and lowly while still in human form, if one knows one’s destiny-day but lacks the means to perform grand rites, one may still offer a cup of water or a flower, focus one’s mind, bow toward the Northern Culmen, and recite the name of the Perfected Lord of one’s destiny. In this way, one will not pass through the limit-period of one’s destiny in vain, but will extend life and inscribe blessings, always retaining human form, dispelling calamities, and accruing boundless fortune.\n\nThe Heavenly Master rejoiced, leapt, and bowed in reverence, praising the encounter with this unsurpassed Dharma bridge as something rarely attainable. Lord Lao further addressed the Heavenly Master, saying: \"The sins, blessings, good, and evil of the world’s people all fall under the jurisdiction of the celestial authorities. To repent of sins and dissolve disasters, nothing surpasses devout practice. On one’s destiny-day, birthday, the day of the Middle Prime, the Horse Day of Departure, the Day of Exfoliation, or during the Three Disasters and Nine Calamities, one should ensure the peace and well-being of one’s present family.\n\nIf superior practitioners uphold this true text on their destiny-days, they will externally subdue demonic forces and internally stabilize their true nature. Their merit will extend to the water and land realms, benefiting both the living and the dead. Through repentance and reverence, they will gradually ascend to the wondrous fruit, reestablish profound merit, and realize the Dao of Emptiness and Non-being. Thus, they will attain the perfection of sagely wisdom, their presence and absence unfathomable, moving freely between existence and non-existence, roaming the cloudy skies, ascending through the Golden Gate, and uniting with the Perfected. Their bodies will transcend the Three Realms, never again to be subject to the wheel of rebirth, their lifespan boundless, and their joy and freedom unending.\"\n\nWhen men and women, on their destiny-days or during various fasts, purify body and mind, burn incense, and uphold this true text, they may recognize the Star Lord to whom their destiny is bound at the Northern Pole. With sincere prayer, no good shall go unanswered; calamities and transgressions shall be dissolved, drawing the response of ten thousand sages and a thousand Perfected Ones, all coming to guard and protect. Wherever this text resides, a thousand Perfected Ones pay reverence, and ten thousand sages offer protection. Demons and ghosts withdraw in silence, spirits and numina conceal themselves. All worldly misfortunes and disasters shall be utterly eradicated.\n\nThis is called *The Northern Dipper’s Destiny-Prolonging Scripture and Formula*—the very path of cultivating the true, the means to attain the Dao and roam freely. Through this scripture, one certifies sagehood and achieves Perfection; through this scripture, one transcends birth and death; through this scripture, men and women are safeguarded; through this scripture, life is preserved and years extended, granting boundless freedom. It shall forever be a treasure of the body, bestowing blessings and longevity. Guard it with reverence; do not reveal it to the unworthy.\n\nAs the Venerable Lord concluded the scripture, dragons, cranes, and celestial immortals came to welcome him, escorting him back to Jade Capital. At that moment, the Heavenly Master, having received this wondrous Dharma, declared: \"I vow to propagate it widely, transmitting it to the virtuous. If men or women receive, uphold, and recite it, I, along with the Ten Precept Celestial Officials, shall protect them wherever they may be.\" Thereupon, he bowed to the Venerable Lord and offered this eulogy:\n\nWhere the *Northern Dipper Scripture* dwells,\nOne’s destiny invokes true numen.\nWhere the *Northern Dipper Scripture* dwells,\nThe household attains peace and tranquility.\nWhere the *Northern Dipper Scripture* dwells,\nParents are preserved in long life.\nWhere the *Northern Dipper Scripture* dwells,\nAll malevolent forces turn to dust.\nWhere the *Northern Dipper Scripture* dwells,\nMyriad evils naturally return to rectitude.\nWhere the *Northern Dipper Scripture* dwells,\nAll undertakings prosper as desired.\nWhere the *Northern Dipper Scripture* dwells,\nThe entire family enjoys health and well-being.\nWhere the *Northern Dipper Scripture* dwells,\nDescendants are safeguarded in glory and flourishing.\nWhere the *Northern Dipper Scripture* dwells,\nThe five paths open of their own accord.\nWhere the *Northern Dipper Scripture* dwells,\nAll misfortunes are forever extinguished.\nWhere the *Northern Dipper Scripture* dwells,\nLivestock thrives and multiplies.\nWhere the *Northern Dipper Scripture* dwells,\nIllnesses find healing and recovery.\nWhere the *Northern Dipper Scripture* dwells,\nWealth and possessions are not squandered in vain.\nWhere the *Northern Dipper Scripture* dwells,\nUnforeseen troubles never arise.\nWhere the *Northern Dipper Scripture* dwells,\nOne eternally preserves harmony, benefit, and integrity.\n\nThe Venerable Lord said: \"Excellent! Excellent!\"\n\n\"You may propagate the true teaching,\nIts boundless blessings and benefits\nShall universally reach all beings,\nEternally bestowing supreme goodness.\"\n\nThe Heavenly Master bowed his head in reverence and gratitude,\nFaithfully receiving and upholding the teaching.\n\nThus concludes the *Most High Mysterious Numinous Northern Dipper Original Destiny Life-Prolonging True Scripture*.",

      "translated_text": "The common folk in the world are often lost and deluded, unaware that their bodies belong to the Northern Dipper and their lives are governed by the Celestial Treasury. When disasters and misfortunes strike, they know not the gate of absolution; when they pray for blessings and longevity, they remain ignorant of the path to return to truth. Thus, their souls are assailed, and calamities cling to them. Some suffer from chronic illness, others are afflicted by malevolent spirits, languishing for years in distress, entangled in misfortune for ages. Lawsuits and summonses arise, ancestral spirits are implicated, or heavenly reprimands descend, or vengeful ghosts lodge false accusations. When such perils arise, how may one seek deliverance? One must urgently petition the Northern Dipper, offer rites of gratitude to the Perfected Lords, and recite the true scriptures, recognizing the Perfected Lord of one’s own destiny—only then may one attain peace and prosperity, even flourishing in health and honor. There are yet deeper mysteries that cannot be fully expounded.\n\nWhenever one beholds the true form of the Northern Dipper, one must bow in reverence and pay homage. The first star, Yang Brightness, the Greedy Wolf Great Star Lord, governs those born in the year of the Rat. The second star, Yin Essence, the Great Gate Primordial Star Lord, governs those born in the years of the Ox and Pig. The third star, Perfected Human, the Emolument-Store True Star Lord, governs those born in the years of the Tiger and Dog. The fourth star, Mysterious Darkness, the Literary Curved Binding Star Lord, governs those born in the years of the Rabbit and Rooster. The fifth star, Cinnabar Prime, the Upright Integrity Network Star Lord, governs those born in the years of the Dragon and Monkey. The sixth star, Northern Culmen, the Martial Curved Chronicle Star Lord, governs those born in the years of the Snake and Sheep. The seventh star, Celestial Pass, the Broken Army Pass Star Lord, governs those born in the year of the Horse. The eighth star is the Cavern Brightness Outer Auxiliary Star Lord, and the ninth is the Hidden Light Inner Assistant Star Lord. The Upper Terrace is the Void Essence Opening Virtue Star Lord, the Middle Terrace is the Sixfold Purity Controller of Emptiness Star Lord, and the Lower Terrace is the Curved Life Controller of Emolument Star Lord. These are the names and titles of the Perfected Lords, which one may rarely hear. Yet whoever hears and upholds them is one of profound Daoist devotion, blessed with good karmic affinity from past lives. To hear and recite them brings merit and power beyond measure.\n\nIf devout men and women of true faith encounter this true scripture, their wisdom-nature will become complete, their Daoist heart will unfold, they will emerge from the paths of delusion, enter the Gate of the Subtle and Inaudible, return to the true lineage, and attain the realm of flourishing life. On the days of the Three Primes, the Eight Festivals, one’s destiny-day, birthday, or the day beneath the Northern Dipper, one should meticulously prepare an altar, recite the scriptures, hold fasts and offer rites, and perform the Daoist liturgy according to the proper forms. The blessings thus accrued will be boundless, spanning lives across generations, never straying from true nature, never falling into heterodox views. Those who uphold this scripture should constantly recite the honored names of the Seven Perfected Lords of the Northern Dipper. When their virtuous merit is complete, auspicious signs will descend.\n\nThe Northern Dipper Incantation is as follows:\nNorthern Dipper of Nine Stars, great deities of the central heavens,\nAbove they ascend to the Golden Gates, below they cover Kunlun.\nThey regulate the cosmic order, govern the cosmos and earth.\nGreat Dipper and Greedy Wolf, Great Gate and Emolument-Store,\nLiterary Curved and Upright Integrity, Martial Curved and Broken Army.\nSupreme Jade Emperor, Purple Tenuity Emperor Lord,\nEncompassing the great celestial realm, penetrating even the tiniest dust.\nWhat disaster cannot be eradicated? What blessing cannot be attained?\nPrime imperial qi, come and merge with my body.\nWherever the Celestial Pivot points, it turns day and night without cease.\nThe common folk, though humble, seek the Dao and yearn for numinous power.\nMay they behold your honored form and forever preserve long life.\nThe Three Terraces of Void Essence, the Sixfold Purity of Curved Life,\nThey give me life, nurture me, and protect my form.\n[...] honored Emperor of the Dipper, swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!\n\nLord Lao said: \"The five constituents of human nature and life all fall under the governance of the Star Official of one’s destiny. The spirit-generals of one’s destiny and the stellar officials of one’s natal constellation constantly bestow their protection, sustaining one’s life and preserving one’s allotted years. Yet the common folk, ignorant and unenlightened, remain unaware throughout their lives. The Perfected Official of one’s destiny descends to the human realm six times each year, and the day of descent is one’s destiny-day. During the limit-period, thirty thousand Southern Mound Envoys and seventy thousand spirit-generals of the Northern Dipper accompany the Perfected Official of one’s destiny in their descent, with all the Perfected Ones gathering to offer protection. This is the time to dissolve disasters, repent of sins, pray for blessings, and extend life. According to one’s means, one may perform rites and fasts, thereby augmenting one’s fortune and virtue.\n\nIf the limit-period of one’s destiny is approaching and one remains unaware, failing to prepare fasts and rites or maintain incense offerings, this is to treat life with contempt, to be deluded about one’s origin, and to disregard the value of human existence. The celestial authorities will revoke one’s emoluments, reduce one’s allotted years, and curtail one’s lifespan, often leading to premature death. Those who err in this way, even if they encounter the scriptural instructions, harbor disbelief, slander the true text, and thus, after their bodies perish, they will sink into the Three Wretched Realms, drift through the various destinies, and forever lose human form. How tragic and pitiable it is that they bring such suffering upon themselves!\n\nIf, on one’s destiny-day, one can perform fasts and rites, and sincerely communicate with the celestial authorities, reciting the true scriptures during the limit-period of one’s destiny, and broadly presenting offerings, then for three lifetimes one will always be reborn as a man, wealthy, noble, intelligent, and preeminent among humanity. Even if one’s karmic endowment in this life is meager, leaving one poor and lowly while still in human form, if one knows one’s destiny-day but lacks the means to perform grand rites, one may still offer a cup of water or a flower, focus one’s mind, bow toward the Northern Culmen, and recite the name of the Perfected Lord of one’s destiny. In this way, one will not pass through the limit-period of one’s destiny in vain, but will extend life and inscribe blessings, always retaining human form, dispelling calamities, and accruing boundless fortune.\n\nThe Heavenly Master rejoiced, leapt, and bowed in reverence, praising the encounter with this unsurpassed Dharma bridge as something rarely attainable. Lord Lao further addressed the Heavenly Master, saying: \"The sins, blessings, good, and evil of the world’s people all fall under the jurisdiction of the celestial authorities. To repent of sins and dissolve disasters, nothing surpasses devout practice. On one’s destiny-day, birthday, the day of the Middle Prime, the Horse Day of Departure, the Day of Exfoliation, or during the Three Disasters and Nine Calamities, one should ensure the peace and well-being of one’s present family.\n\nIf superior practitioners uphold this true text on their destiny-days, they will externally subdue demonic forces and internally stabilize their true nature. Their merit will extend to the water and land realms, benefiting both the living and the dead. Through repentance and reverence, they will gradually ascend to the wondrous fruit, reestablish profound merit, and realize the Dao of Emptiness and Non-being. Thus, they will attain the perfection of sagely wisdom, their presence and absence unfathomable, moving freely between existence and non-existence, roaming the cloudy skies, ascending through the Golden Gate, and uniting with the Perfected. Their bodies will transcend the Three Realms, never again to be subject to the wheel of rebirth, their lifespan boundless, and their joy and freedom unending.\"",
