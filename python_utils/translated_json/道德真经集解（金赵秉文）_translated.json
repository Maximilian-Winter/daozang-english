Source of the base text: The Zhengtong Daozang (正统道藏), in the Dunshen (洞神) section, under the Yujue (玉诀) class. Cross-referenced text: The Wuxiu (無求備齐) reprint by Qian Peiming (錢培名) from the Xiaowan (小万) collection (published in Qing Chengfeng 4th year, abbreviated as Xiaowanben).*\n\n---\n\n**Volume One: Commentary by Zhao the Scholar**\n**Chapter One: \"The Dao That Can Be Spoken\"**\n\nThe Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao.\nIf it were not the eternal Dao, yet it can be spoken—how can it be eternal?\n\nNow, benevolence (仁), righteousness (义), propriety (礼), and wisdom (智)—these are the Dao that can be spoken.\nThe Dao that cannot be spoken: benevolence cannot be made into righteousness, propriety cannot be made into wisdom.\nThe Dao that can be spoken is not eternal #1, yet the Dao that cannot be spoken is eternal.\nThus, in benevolence, it is benevolence; in righteousness, it is righteousness; in propriety, it is propriety; in wisdom, it is wisdom.\nThe Dao that can be spoken is not eternal, yet the Dao itself does not change; the Dao that cannot be spoken is eternal, such is its nature.\n\nA name can be named, yet it is not the eternal name.\nThe Dao cannot be spoken, yet how much more so can it be named?\n\nAll names are merely the Dao that can be spoken.\nOnce names are established, distinctions between round and square, curved and straight, cannot be eternal.\n\nYanzun (严遵) and Junping (君平) said:\nHaving a name is not the Dao; not having a name is not the Dao.\nHaving form is not the Dao; not having form is not the Dao.\nWithout a name, yet nothing is without a name; without form, yet nothing is without form.\nWithout a name, it is the beginning of heaven and earth;\nWith a name, it is the mother of all things.\nEternal non-being, to observe its subtlety (妙);\nEternal being, to observe its transformations (徼).\nFrom its eternal non-being, form arises as heaven and earth,\nHeaven and earth stand, and names begin to be established.\nIt spreads as all things, all things follow the Dao, yet names cannot exhaust their use—\nThus, the eternal non-being is the essence of the Dao,\nAnd the eternal being is the manifestation of the Dao.\n\nThe sage embodies the Dao for the world’s use,\nEntering all things while remaining in eternal non-being,\nTo observe its subtlety (妙),\nAnd embodying the utmost non-being while remaining in eternal being,\nTo observe its transformations (徼).\nIf one acts only in its transformations and does not know its subtlety,\nIt is coarse and not profound.\nIf one drifts only in its subtlety and does not know its transformations,\nIt is refined yet not practical.\n\nSima Junshi (司马君实) said:\nCall the beginning of heaven and earth \"non-being\" (无),\nCall the mother of all things \"being\" (有).\nWang Xiu (王秀) said:\nBeing and non-being share the same essence,\nThe words \"beginning\" and \"mother\" are mere aids to understanding.\n\nWang Bi (王弼) believed:\n\"Eternal being\" (常有) is to observe its transformations (徼).\nIf one seeks eternal being, then how could one observe its transformations,\nWhen all things are drowned and lost in the myriad forms?\nAt the end, there are heaven and earth—who could name them?\n\nWithout a name, it is the beginning of heaven and earth;\nWith a name, then all things are born—hence, \"being\" is the mother of all things.\nZhuangzi (庄子) said:\nThe Old Master (老氏) established eternal non-being,\nNot founding any single thing—this is eternal non-being;\nNot abandoning any single thing #2—this is eternal being.\nEternal non-being lies in principle (理),\nIts heights are not bright—it is the utmost subtlety in the world, hence to observe its subtlety.\nEternal being lies in affairs (事),\nIts depths are not dark—it is the utmost transformation in the world, hence to observe its transformations.\nTo abandon being is to cling to emptiness,\nTo follow transformations is to forget the root—\nThus, great wisdom observes both.\n\nThese two are the same source yet different names,\nBoth called \"profound\" (玄).\nSpeaking in terms of form,\nBeing and non-being seem to be two.\n\nHow do you know that non-being moves to become being,\nAnd being returns to become non-being?\nThey have never ceased to be one.\nThough their names differ, their root is the same—\nKnowing that their root is one, then it is profound.\n\nAll that is distant yet without ultimate limit,\nIts hue must be profound—\nThus, the Old Master (老子) often speaks of \"profound\" to convey the utmost.\n\nTaiping Guangshi (太平光师) said:\nOpposition gives rise to names.\nProfound beyond profound, the gateway to all subtleties.\nProfound beyond profound again, it reaches its limit—\nYet there remains a mind that knows of the profound.\nProfound beyond profound again, it is exhausted—\nNo further addition can be made,\nThe gateway through which all subtleties emerge.\nGuang (光) said:\nTo forget the profoundness of the profound, then it is called \"profound beyond profound.\"\n\nZhao Bingwen (赵秉文) said:\nThis chapter reveals the ultimate profundity of the \"double profound\" (重玄),\nNot merely that the Dao that can be spoken is not the Dao,\nNor that the Dao that cannot be spoken is not the Dao.\nZhuangzi said:\nWords and silence are both insufficient to exhaust the Dao—\nNot only is the Dao eternally without name,\nBut even having a name or not having a name is insufficient to exhaust the Dao.\n\nThe eternal non-being is the semblance of the Dao.\nEternal non-being is what the Buddhist schools call \"true emptiness\" (真空);\nEternal being is what the Buddhist schools call \"marvelous existence\" (妙有).\nBoth being and non-being are insufficient to exhaust the Dao—\nThus, it is entrusted to the \"double profound.\"\n\nZhenghe (政和) said:\nProfound is the hue of heaven,\nThe hue that colors all hues is manifest,\nYet the coloring of hues is never displayed.\nProfound beyond profound is the coloring of hues.\nThe profound subtleties of principle,\nAll things possess them together.\nHeaven’s movements, earth’s positions,\nHuman consciousness, the flourishing of all things—\nAll are subtleties, yet all emerge from the profound—\nThus, it is called the \"gateway to all subtleties.\"\n\n**Chapter Two: \"When All Under Heaven Know\"**\n\nWhen all under heaven know beauty as beauty,\nThen ugliness is already present.\nWhen all under heaven know goodness as goodness,\nThen non-goodness is already present.\n\nThus, being and non-being generate each other,\nDifficulty and ease complete each other,\nLong and short define each other,\nHigh and low depend on each other,\nSounds and voices harmonize each other,\nBefore and after follow each other.\n\nAll under heaven speaks of beauty and ugliness in terms of form and name,\nYet what they call \"beautiful and good\" (美且善),\nIs it truly beautiful and good?\nThey do not know that being and non-being,\nDifficulty and ease,\nLong and short,\nHigh and low,\nSounds and voices,\nBefore and after—\nAll mutually oppose each other,\nNone of them is their true nature.\n\nJust when one considers oneself long,\nThere is one longer than me who stands before me—\nThen I am short.\nJust when one considers oneself foremost,\nThere is one who comes before me—\nThen I am behind.\n\nIf one follows what is deemed beautiful and accepts it as true,\nThen one will stray far from the Way.\n\nZhao said:\nBeing and non-being generate each other—\nJust as high must have low,\nThus, though being and non-being differ,\nBoth ultimately escape not-being.\n\nThis speaks of how forms take shape,\nHence, borrowing the expressions of being and non-being to dispel them.\n\nGuang said:\nThese six pairs are why things are unequal,\nOnly those who have lost their counterpart can harmonize them.\n\nZhenghe said:\nThe Dao has no differing appearances—\nWho decides what is beautiful or ugly?\nNature is inherently unified—\nWho decides what is good or evil?\n\nThere is beauty, and ugliness opposes it,\nThus, it is said: \"All under heaven knows beauty as beauty,\nYet ugliness already exists.\"\nThere is goodness, and unkindness opposes it,\nThus, it is said: \"All under heaven knows goodness as goodness,\nYet unkindness already exists.\"\n\nBefore the Supreme Ultimate was divided,\nAll phenomena shared a single body.\nOnce the Two Forces emerged,\nAll things became paired opposites.\n\nThese six pairs arise from myriad transformations,\nFrom a hundred thoughts,\nFrom divergent paths—\nThe way the world’s people drown and cannot extricate themselves.\n\nThus, the Sage acts in non-action,\nTeaches without speaking.\nWhen acting, the mind is one of non-action;\nWhen teaching, the intent is one of non-speech.\n\nWithin proper measure, transcending long and short,\nBeyond the sequence of before and after,\nNeither beautiful nor ugly,\nNeither good nor evil—\nThen how could the world truly know it?\n\nLü Huiqing said:\nThe Sage acts all day yet never acts,\nSpeaks all day yet never speaks.\nAll things act without refusal,\nAre born without possession,\nAct without reliance,\nAnd upon completion, does not claim.\n\nAll things act for me, yet I refuse none.\nI give birth to them yet possess nothing,\nRely on nothing.\nWhen their work is done,\nI do not claim it as my own.\nThis is the teaching of non-action and non-speech—\nHow could ugliness or evil follow such beauty and goodness?\n\nOnly by not claiming does one not lose.\nThe Sage dwells in poverty and lowliness without fear of poverty or lowliness;\nDwells in wealth and honor without the burden of wealth and honor—\nThis is called not claiming.\nIf I do not claim, how could others take it away?\nThis is the ultimate dwelling.\n\nZhenghe said:\nAll things act in parallel,\nResponding to stimuli without refusal.\nThey shape themselves, transform themselves,\nGive birth to themselves, and manifest their own colors—\nWho could possess them?\n\nZhao said:\nThere is non-action in opposition and true non-action;\nThere is non-speech in opposition and true non-speech.\nNon-action and speech in opposition—\nLike the pairs of being and non-being, high and low—what difference is there?\nBut true non-action and non-speech—\nAre those who have lost their counterpart and severed dependence.\n\n**Chapter Three: Not Exalting the Virtuous**\nNot exalting the virtuous prevents the people from striving;\nNot treasuring hard-to-obtain goods prevents theft;\nNot displaying what is desirable prevents disorder of the heart.\n\nThus, the Sage’s governance:\nEmpties the mind, fills the belly,\nWeakens the will, strengthens the bones.\n\nIf one exalts the virtuous, the people will be ashamed of not measuring up and thus contend;\nIf one treasures hard-to-obtain goods, the people will suffer from lack and thus steal;\nIf one displays what is desirable, the people will suffer from not obtaining it and thus rebel.\n\nThough all under heaven knows these three as calamities,\nIf one attempts to abolish them, one will only be confused.\nThe Sage is not thus.\n\nHe has never failed to use the virtuous—\nOnly he does not exalt them;\nHe has never abandoned hard-to-obtain goods—\nOnly he does not treasure them;\nHe has never removed what is desirable—\nOnly he does not display them.\n\nThus, the virtuous are employed yet the people do not contend;\nHard-to-obtain goods and desirable things are present yet theft and chaos do not arise—\nIs this not emptying the mind while not harming the belly’s fullness,\nWeakening the will while not harming the bones’ strength?\n\nNow, if one were to exalt and promote the virtuous,\nTreasure and honor goods,\nDisplay and flaunt what is desirable—\nThen both mind and belly would be filled.\nIf one were to abolish them, then will and bones would weaken.\nWhen mind and belly are filled, the people will not contend;\nWhen will and bones are weakened, no undertaking can stand.\n\nZhao said:\nEmptying the mind and filling the belly—\nThis means the ruler does not exalt, does not treasure, does not display,\nSo the people have no knowledge and no desires.\nSome say emptying the mind nurtures the Dao,\nThough this may be justifiable, it is not the intent of this passage.\nRather, it is to always keep the people without knowledge and desire,\nSo that even the wise dare not act.\n\nThe Sage’s governance aims only to let the people preserve their nature and life.\nExcessive knowledge harms the division of nature and life,\nExcessive desire wounds the essence of nature and life.\nCalled \"governance\" yet what greater chaos could there be?\n\nThus, always keep the people without knowledge and desire,\nDo not deceive them with falsehoods,\nThen the people will not yearn for anything,\nTheir desires will be simple and uncluttered—\nEven the wise will have no schemes to employ.\n\nZhao said:\nWithout yearning, they dare not act.\nZhenghe said:\nThe eloquent dare not display their cleverness,\nThe brave dare not unleash their hostility,\nThe capable dare not boast of their talents,\nThe wise dare not apply their insight—\nThis is called \"making the wise dare not act.\"\n\nActing in non-action, nothing will remain ungoverned.\nUsing these three naturally while not exalting, not treasuring, not displaying—\nThis is called acting in non-action.\n\nZhenghe said:\nThe Sage’s governance does not abandon people or reject things,\nNor does it imagine standing alone in a realm of non-action.\nIt is simply emerging from non-action.\n\nThings have their actions—\nFollow them to observe their return;\nThings have their births—\nGuide them to achieve completion—\nHow could there be no governance?\n\n**Chapter Four: The Dao is Unobstructed**\nThe Dao is unobstructed yet used—\nSeemingly not full, yet profound,\nLike the origin of all things.\n\nThe Dao is unobstructed, reaching the utmost non-being,\nYet with it, it adapts to all things—\nThough vast as heaven and earth,\nBroad as mountains and rivers,\nIt pervades everywhere without form,\nThus it seems not full.\n\nThe depths are profound and boundless—\nI know it is the origin of all things,\nYet dare not speak of it directly,\nThus it is called *seemingly* the origin of all things.\n\nDull its sharpness,\nDissolve its anger,\nBlend its brilliance,\nAlign with the dust—\nCalm, as if it might exist.\n\nNo one lacks the Dao,\nYet the Sage preserves it whole.\nDull its sharpness, lest it stray into recklessness;\nDissolve its anger, lest it clash with things.\nNot straying into recklessness, not clashing with things—\nExternal harm removed, its light emerges,\nYet blending it further, lest it differ from things.\nLight is most pure, dust most mixed—\nThough dust aligns without distinction,\nLest it abandon all things.\nThus, only when fully preserved does it remain calm,\nThough it exists, none recognize it—\nHence, it is called *seemingly* to exist.\n\n**Kaiyuan said:**\nThe Dao is nowhere absent—\nIn light, in dust, all is one with it.\nOne with light and dust, yet its mystery transcends light and dust.\n\n**Wang Bi said:**\nExisting yet not possessing,\nVanishing yet not absent—\nBeing and non-being beyond measure,\nThus it is called *seemingly* to exist.\n\n**Zhenghe said:**\nSharpness brings harm, disorder brings chaos.\nDulling sharpness removes contention,\nDissolving disorder removes strife.\nBlending its light—\nAs Zhuangzi said: *bright yet not dazzling*.\nAligning with dust—\nAs Zhuangzi said: *yielding with things, riding their waves*.\nIn the midst of Tai定, heaven’s light shines naturally,\nDull, as if forgotten yet present.\nI know not who first gave birth to it—\nA precursor to the Emperor.\nThough the Dao eternally exists,\nNone can name it—\nYet it cannot be said to be absent,\nThus: *Is this not the Emperor’s precursor?*\nThe precursor precedes the Emperor,\nYet none precedes it.\n\n**Zhao said:**\nThis chapter begins and ends with the Dao—\nDulling sharpness, dissolving disorder,\nBlending light, aligning with dust—\nThe unknowing do not speak of it,\nThose embodying it transcend dependence, merging in the Mysterious.\nThis is not mere conformity with the vulgar.\n\n---\n**Chapter Five: Heaven and Earth Are Without Virtue**\n\nHeaven and Earth are without virtue,\nYet treat all things as sacrificial dogs;\nThe Sage is without virtue,\nYet treats the people as sacrificial dogs.\n\nHeaven and Earth act without partiality,\nListening to all things’ natural course—\nThus, their birth and death are not my cruelty,\nNor my benevolence.\nLike binding straw into a dog,\nSet for sacrifice,\nAdorned with utmost reverence—\nYet not loved—\nIt is merely the time’s demand.\nWhen the rites conclude, it is discarded,\nTrampled by passersby—\nYet not hated—\nAlso the time’s demand.\n\nSo too the Sage treats the people—\nOnly ensuring no harm,\nThus the people preserve their nature.\nLife and death, gain and loss—\nI have no part in them.\nThough I never acted benevolently,\nBenevolence is vast.\n\n**Zhenghe said:**\nFavor arises from harm,\nHarm arises from favor.\nIf virtue is favor, harm follows.\nHeaven and Earth toward all things,\nThe Sage toward the people—\nAiding their natural course,\nWithout love or gain,\nVirtue cannot be named.\n\nLike straw dogs for sacrifice—\nUsed when fitting, discarded when past,\nSo too all things’ self-generation,\nThe people’s self-governance—\nHow could they demand affection?\n\nBetween heaven and earth—\nIs it like the bellows and the bellows-key?\nEmpty yet unyielding,\nMoving yet ever producing.\nThings have bellows and bellows-keys—\nWhen one moves,\nQi flows wherever it reaches,\nYet the unknowing deem it the pinnacle of craft.\nBut what use are bellows and bellows-keys?\nThey are empty yet unyielding,\nThus moving yet ever producing.\n\nBetween heaven and earth,\nTheir generation and destruction of all things,\nTheir carving of myriad forms—\nIs no different.\n\n**Zhenghe said:**\nThe bellows-key is empty yet receptive,\nReceptive yet responsive,\nThus responsive without exhaustion.\nIf filled with substance,\nEvery touch would obstruct.\nMuch speech leads to exhaustion—\nBetter to guard the center.\nSeeing its motion yet endless,\nThey know not it is the response of emptiness within—\nThus I tell them: much speech exhausts,\nBetter to guard the center’s inexhaustibility.\n\n**Lu said:**\nAll things rely on heaven and earth to live,\nYet heaven and earth take nothing from them;\nThe people depend on the Sage to govern,\nYet the Sage borrows nothing from them—\nLike straw dogs formed by divine offerings,\nYet divine offerings derive no use from them.\nOnly the unneeding are without partiality,\nWithout partiality, without favor—\nThus heaven and earth, without favor, yet great favor arises,\nThe Sage, without virtue, yet great virtue is complete.\nThus the people do not decline the Sage’s virtue,\nAll things do not thank heaven and earth for life.\nHow do I know this?\nI observe between heaven and earth—\nLike the bellows-key’s lack of intent.\nThe bellows-key lacks intent,\nThus its sound is unyielding,\nIts qi ever flowing;\nHeaven and Earth lack intent,\nThus generation never ceases;\nThe Sage lacks intent,\nThus governance never exhausts in speech.\nMuch speech without substance exhausts—\nNot as effective as *wuwei* and silence,\nThe art of guarding the center.\n\n---\n**Chapter Six: The Valley Spirit Does Not Die**\n\nThe Valley Spirit does not die—\nThis is called the Mysterious Feminine, the Valley.\nMost empty yet still with form,\nThe Valley Spirit is empty yet without form.\nEmpty and without form,\nStill without birth—\nHow could there be death?\n\nCalled the Valley Spirit—\nSpeaking of its virtue;\nCalled the Mysterious Feminine—\nSpeaking of its function.\nThe Feminine gives birth to all things,\nYet is called Mysterious—\nFor though its birth is seen,\nIts *how* of birth is unseen.\n\n**Sun Simiao said:**\nThe Valley Spirit is empty yet numinous.\n\n**Zhenghe said:**\nForm brings rise and decline,\nMeasure brings completion and ruin.\nForm and measure together—\nBirth and death are divided,\nThe nature of things.\nThe Valley responds to all movement yet remains ever empty,\nThe Spirit marvels at all things yet remains ever still,\nIn the eternal True,\nOne with the Dao.\nNot clinging to form,\nNot falling into measure,\nGenerating endlessly without exhaustion—\nThus it is said: *does not die*.\n\nThe Valley Spirit as a metaphor for the eternal Dao,\nThe Mysterious Feminine to reveal the marvel of creation.\n\nThe Mysterious Feminine’s gate—\nThis is called the root of Heaven and Earth.\nThe Mysterious Feminine’s gate—\nAll things arise from here,\nHeaven and Earth’s root—\nFrom here they spring.\n\nEndless and subtle, as if it exists,\nYet used without effort.\nEndless—\nSoft yet never ceasing,\nAs if it exists—\nExisting yet unseen.\n\nIf one could be thus,\nEven if used all day, it would never weary.\n\n**Wang Bi said:**\nWould you say it exists?\nIts form is unseen.\nWould you say it perishes?\nAll things arise from it.\nThus it is endless and as if it exists,\nWithout it nothing is formed,\nYet its use is effortless—\nHence it is said: *without effort*.\n\n**Zhao said:**\nThis chapter speaks of the Dao’s effortless, formless nature,\nGiving birth to Heaven and Earth,\nEver fixed since ancient times.\nRiver Master likens the Mysterious Feminine to mouth and nose,\nYet those who nurture life still revere it—\nHow small his understanding!\n\n**Chapter Seven: Heaven and Earth Endure**\nHeaven and Earth, though vast,\nAre bound by form and measure,\nSo their endurance is limited.\n\nYet Laozi says their endurance reaches Heaven and Earth—\nHe speaks only of what people perceive.\nBut the supreme endurance is what is called\nThe root of Heaven and Earth.\nHeaven and Earth endure so long\nBecause they do not generate themselves,\nThus they endure eternally.\n\nTherefore, the Sage yields his own life yet comes first,\nSets his own life aside yet preserves it.\nIs this not because he has no selfishness?\nHence his selfishness is fulfilled.\nHeaven and Earth give birth to all things yet do not generate themselves,\nStanding beyond all things.\nThus they endure eternally.\nThe Sage yields his own life yet comes before others,\nSets his own life aside yet benefits others,\nStanding apart from the crowd,\nThus he comes first and is preserved.\n\nIf Heaven and Earth competed with things to generate,\nAnd the Sage contended with people for gain,\nThen Heaven and Earth would be but one thing,\nAnd the Sage but one person—\nHow could they surpass all others?\n\nThough he has no selfishness,\nIt is not to seek selfishness’ fulfillment,\nYet selfishness is fulfilled through him.\nThe Dao is simply thus.\n\n**Jiuji said:**\nThe Sage aligns with Heaven and Earth,\nYielding his own life, setting it aside,\nAs Heaven and Earth do not generate themselves,\nHis life comes first, is preserved,\nAs Heaven and Earth endure eternally.\nYielding his own life—\nHe places himself below others,\nThus his life comes first.\nSetting his own life aside—\nOthers protect him,\nThus his life is preserved.\n\n**Chapter Eight: The Supreme Good is Like Water**\nThe supreme good is like water,\nWater benefits all things yet does not contend,\nDwelling where people revile—\nThus it nears the Dao.\n\n*The Classic of Changes* says:\nOne yin, one yang—\nThis is called the Dao,\nThe continuation of it is virtue,\nThe fulfillment of it is nature.\n\nAgain it says:\nHeaven’s One generates water.\nThe Dao manifests as virtue,\nLike *qi* forming water—\nHence the supreme good is like water.\n\nBoth arise from the formless and achieve form,\nThus their principles are the same.\n\nThe Dao is present everywhere,\nBenefits all things—\nWater does likewise.\nYet once it clings to form,\nIt diverges from the Dao,\nHence it is said: *it nears the Dao*.\nYet among named virtues,\nNone surpass this—\nHence the supreme good.\n\nDwelling in virtue’s ground,\nMind in virtue’s depths,\nAligned with virtue’s benevolence,\nSpeech in virtue’s trust,\nGovernance in virtue’s order,\nActions in virtue’s skill,\nMovements in virtue’s timing.\n\nAvoiding heights, seeking lows,\nNever acting against nature—\nThis is virtue’s ground.\nEmpty, still, profound—\nFathomless depths—\nThis is virtue’s mind.\nBenefiting all things,\nGiving without seeking return—\nThis is virtue’s benevolence.\nWhen confined, it turns—\nWhen straight, it bends—\nWhen blocked, it stops—\nWhen released, it flows—\nThis is virtue’s trust.\nWashing clean all impurities,\nBalancing high and low—\nThis is virtue’s order.\nMeeting things, it takes their form,\nYet does not linger—\nThis is virtue’s skill.\nIn winter it congeals,\nIn spring it thaws—\nIn drought it recedes,\nIn flood it swells,\nNever losing its rhythm—\nThis is virtue’s timing.\n\nOnly because it does not contend,\nIt has no grievances.\nIf virtue exists yet is not spared,\nIt is because of contention.\nWater does not contend,\nYet possesses seven virtues,\nAnd has no grievances.\n\n**Chapter Nine: Holding Yet Filling**\nHolding yet filling—\nBetter than its fullness.\nGrasping yet sharpening—\nCannot long endure.\n\nKnowing fullness must overflow,\nAnd holding it firm,\nBetter than letting it not fill.\nKnowing sharpness must break,\nAnd grasping it first,\nYet knowing grasping cannot ensure safety.\n\nIf the Sage has yet does not hold,\nHow could there be fullness?\nFollowing principle then acting,\nHow could there be sharpness?\n\nNo fullness means no need for holding,\nNo sharpness means no need for grasping.\n\n**Zhenghe said:**\nHolding fullness to prevent overflow,\nYet filling it—\nThis invites greater overflow,\nThus its nature must decline.\nIf one wishes to avoid overflow,\nBetter to avoid fullness entirely.\nGrasping to fear loss,\nYet sharpening it—\nThis invites greater loss.\nIf one wishes to avoid loss,\nBetter to avoid sharpening entirely.\n\nGold and jade fill the hall,\nYet none can guard them.\nRiches and honor bring arrogance,\nThus one invites his own blame.\n\nWhen achievement is complete,\nName is secured,\nRetire—\nThis is Heaven’s Way.\nMidday sun must move,\nFull moon must wane—\nThe rhythm of the four seasons,\nAchievers depart.\nHeaven and Earth do this—\nHow much more so for people?\n\n**Zhenghe said:**\nHe who hoards gold and jade\nIs burdened by things,\nBurdened by things—\nHow could he avoid loss?\nThus none can guard them.\nRiches and honor bring arrogance,\nHarming his virtue,\nHarmed in virtue—\nHow could he escape misfortune?\nThus he invites his own blame.\n\n**Chapter Ten: Carrying the Vital Essence**\nCarrying the vital essence,\nEmbracing the One—\nCould it avoid separation?\n\nThe vital essence differs from the spirit,\nFor the vital essence is material,\nThe spirit is divine.\n*The Classic of Changes* says:\nEssence and *qi* form things,\nThe wandering spirit brings change—\nThus one knows the nature of ghosts and gods.\n\nThe vital essence is material,\nThus it is mixed and fixed;\nThe spirit is divine,\nThus it is singular and ever-changing.\nCalled the vital essence—\nThis speaks of its fixation.\nThe Dao is present everywhere,\nIn humans it is nature,\nAnd nature’s subtlety is the spirit.\n\n「Speaking of its purity and unadulteration, we call it *One*;\nSpeaking of its gathering and undissipation, we call it *Pu* (uncarved).\nBoth return to the Dao,\nEach following its own inherent truth.\n\nThe sage’s nature is steadfast,\nHis spirit is concentrated,\nNot swayed by things.\nThough he takes the *arc* (vital essence) as his dwelling,\nWhen his spirit wishes to move,\nThe *arc* follows without fail—\nThus his spirit is always carried by the *arc*.\n\nThe common folk are enslaved by things,\nTheir spirit is dull and ungoverned,\nThus their spirit is subject to the *arc*.\n\nThe ears and eyes are burdened by sounds and colors,\nThe mouth and nose labor over smells and tastes;\nWhen the *arc* wishes to move,\nThe spirit follows—\nThus the *arc* is always embraced by the spirit.\n\nTherefore, he is taught to embrace the spirit and carry the *arc*,\nSo that the two never separate—\nThis is indeed the essential method of the sage’s self-cultivation.\n\nAs for the ancient *true person* (真人),\nWith deep roots and firm foundations,\nThe Dao of longevity and enduring vision—\nIt is the same.\n\nLu said: *\"Arc\"* is the beginning of speech.\nZhenghe said: The *arc* is yin.\nResiding in the body with fixed purpose,\nThus Laozi spoke of the *arc* as \"vital essence.\"\n\nThe spirit is yang.\nSupported by *qi* yet unbound in its movement,\nThus *The Classic of Changes* spoke of the spirit as \"wandering.\"\n\nThe sage governs his form with the spirit,\nAnd controls the *arc* with the spirit—\nThus the spirit is always carried by the spirit,\nAnd never by the *arc*.\n\nHeaven’s One generates water,\nWhich in things becomes essence;\nEarth’s Two generates fire,\nWhich in things becomes spirit.\nSpirit and essence arise from the Dao,\nThe form is born from essence;\nGuarding them without loss,\nAnd uniting them with the spirit—\nThen essence and spirit coalesce without admixture.\n\nWith essence to gather the spirit,\nWith the spirit to direct the form,\nWith the form to sustain the spirit—\nEssence complete yet undiminished,\nSpirit active yet not overbearing,\nForm alive yet not exhausted—\nLike the sun and moon adorned upon heaven,\nLike grasses and trees adorned upon earth,\nNever once separating.\n\nConcentrating *qi* to attain softness,\nCould one achieve the state of an infant?\nIf the spirit is ungoverned, *qi* is disordered,\nThe strong delight in contention,\nThe weak delight in fear,\nUnaware of themselves.\n\nIf the spirit is governed, *qi* does not act recklessly,\nJoy and anger follow their proper kinds—\nThis is called concentrating *qi*.\n\nThe spirit is the utmost of emptiness,\n*Qi* is the beginning of substance;\nThe extreme of emptiness is softness,\nThe extreme of substance is hardness.\nPure nature without *qi* is called attaining softness—\nThe infant knows no good or evil,\nThus his nature is complete.\n\nNature complete yet *qi* subtle,\n*Qi* subtle yet the body soft—\nConcentrating *qi* to attain softness,\nTo achieve the state of an infant is the pinnacle.\n\nZhenghe said: Stillness without admixture is called concentration,\nHarmony without excess is called softness.\n\nThe infant at rest does not know his actions,\nIn motion does not know his destination,\nHolding no judgments of right or wrong, good or evil—\nThus his *qi* is concentrated and softness attained.\n\nMencius said: Stumbling, rushing—\nThis is *qi*.\nYet if the heart is moved against it,\nThe heart cannot concentrate *qi*—\nThen *qi* has the irregularity of stumbling and rushing,\nAnd the heart reaches the point of being moved.\nWhen moved, it cannot be restrained.\n\nThe sage empties himself to wander in the world,\nHis heart does not force *qi* to act—\nThus his stillness is without admixture,\nHis harmony is without excess,\nAnd what difference is there between him and the infant?\nHence it is said: Could one achieve the state of an infant?\n\nPurification and boundless vision,\nCould one avoid deception?\nThe sage externally is not carried by the *arc*,\nInternally is not directed by *qi*—\nThus his purification of dust and filth is complete.\n\nThen his spirit is vast and boundless,\nKnowing all things arise from nature,\nEqually observing the pure and the impure without bias or deception.\nPurifying all actions yet not possessing them,\nBoundless vision of subtle principles yet silently recognizing them.\n\nLoving the people and governing the state,\nCould one avoid action?\nHaving already cultivated the self,\nHe extends this further to all people—\nEven reaching the point of loving the people and governing the state,\nHe meets them all with a heart of non-action.\n\nIf he were to act with a heart,\nThen loving the people would harm them,\nAnd governing the state would disrupt it.\n\nThe opening and closing of the heavenly gates,\nCould one act as the female?\nThe heavenly gates are the source of order and chaos, decay and flourishing.\nHaving already entrusted oneself to the world,\nIn the intervals of opening and closing,\nThe common folk value gain and fear loss,\nThus they act in advance to seek fortune.\n\nThe sage follows principle to know the mandate of Heaven,\nThus he waits for the lead before harmonizing.\n\n*The Classic of Changes* says:\n\"Act before Heaven and Heaven will not oppose you—\nThis is not acting before Heaven;\nAct after Heaven and follow the timing of Heaven—\nThis is not acting after Heaven.\"\nIt speaks of acting before or after,\nAlways aligning with the mandate of Heaven.\n\nOtherwise, acting before Heaven would be too early,\nActing after Heaven would be too late—\nBoth would be mistaken.\n\nThus, what is called \"acting as the female\"\nIs also nothing but not losing the proper time.\n\nZhenghe said: Knowing the male, guarding the female,\nThis is the valley of the world.\n\nClear and all-encompassing,\nCould one avoid knowing?\nInternally cultivating the self,\nExternally governing the state—\nEven reaching the point of facing changes,\nThere is no action without method—\nIs this not the clarity and all-encompassing nature of the heart?\n\nThe heart is singular—\nIf there is again a heart that knows,\nThen this is twofold.\nFrom singularity to duality,\nBias begins here,\nAnd foolishness takes root.\n\nNow, the mirror’s relation to things—\nWhen they come, it responds—\nAnd yet, how could it know the things that respond to it?\nThe source is without knowing,\nYet if knowing is added by intention,\nThis is the origin of falsehood.\n\nZhenghe said: Bright wisdom and sagely intelligence,\nGuarded by them with foolishness.\n\nNurturing and storing life,\nNurturing without possessing,\nActing without relying,\nGrowing without controlling—\nThis is called *mysterious virtue* (玄德).\n\nIts Dao suffices to nurture and store all things,\nYet it does not possess, rely, or control them.\nThough it has great virtue,\nThings know it not—\nThus it is called *mysterious virtue*.\n\nWang Pan said: This chapter exhausts the sequence of self-cultivation,\nFrom the scholar to the attainment of entering sainthood through bodily refinement.\n\n**Chapter Eleven: The Thirty Spokes Share One Hub**\nThe thirty spokes converge at one hub;\nWhen there is nothing in the hub,\nThere is the utility of the wheel—」\n\n**Chapter Twelve: The Five Colors**\nWhen clay is shaped into vessels,\nIt is their emptiness that gives them use.\nWhen doors and windows are carved for a house,\nIt is their emptiness that gives it use.\nThus, having is for utility,\nBut emptiness is for function.\n\nExhausting knowledge to craft vessels,\nTheir use lies always in their emptiness.\nWithout emptiness, there is no use—\nWithout use, there is no utility.\nThus, the Sage observes the mysterious through emptiness,\nAnd observes the ordinary through having.\nTo know these two as one, indivisible,\nIs to attain the utmost.\n\nThe five colors blind the eyes,\nThe five tones deafen the ears,\nThe five flavors dull the palate.\nTo see colors, hear sounds, taste flavors—\nTheir origin lies in nature itself,\nYet no thing exists in them.\nThis is the utmost.\n\nBut when the eyes cling to the five colors,\nThe ears to the five tones,\nThe mouth to the five flavors,\nAnd they lose their original nature,\nThen though they see, they are truly blind;\nThough they hear, they are truly deaf;\nThough they taste, they are truly dull.\n\n**Luóshì** said:\nIf one does not know the emptiness of form and sound,\nHow is it different from blindness and deafness?\n\nHunting and chasing game drives the mind to madness,\nRare treasures cause one to act recklessly.\nThus, the Sage nourishes the belly, not the eyes.\nHence, he discards the former and takes the latter.\n\nThe Sage’s seeing of colors, hearing of sounds, and tasting of flavors\nAre the same as others’.\nYet when it comes to hunting and chasing game,\nHe never does so,\nAnd when it comes to rare treasures,\nHe never uses them.\n\nYet people consider this a disease,\nWhile the Sage alone considers it a blessing.\nWhy so?\n\nThe Sage nourishes the belly, while the common man nourishes the eyes.\nThe eyes are greedy and cannot receive,\nBut the belly receives without greed.\n\nExternal things come from without,\nWhile nature solidifies within.\n\n**Lù** said:\nNourishing the belly means knowing contentment,\nNot nourishing the eyes means not seeing what is desirable.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Thirteen: Honor and Humiliation**\nHonor and humiliation are like sudden shocks,\nGreat calamities are like the body itself.\n\nThe ancient enlightened ones were shocked by honor as by humiliation,\nKnowing that honor is the root of humiliation.\nThey valued the body as they valued great calamities,\nKnowing that the body is the root of calamity.\n\nThus, they abandoned honor and humiliation did not reach them,\nThey forgot the body and calamity did not come.\n\nWhat is meant by honor and humiliation?\nHonor is low—\nTo gain it is like a shock,\nTo lose it is like a shock—\nThis is called *honor and humiliation as shocks*.\n\nHonor and humiliation are not two things.\nHumiliation arises from honor, yet the world does not realize it.\nThose who consider honor superior and humiliation inferior\nAre all mistaken.\n\nIf one knows that humiliation arises from honor,\nThen honor is indeed low.\n\nThus, the ancient enlightened ones were shocked by honor,\nNever resting in honor while fearing humiliation.\nWhat is meant by *shocks*?\nNot true shock—\nOnly the appearance of shock.\n\n**Guāng** said:\nOnly when the emotions of the common and the Sage are exhausted\nIs there no shock.\n\nWhat is meant by *valuing great calamity as the body*?\nThe reason I have great calamity\nIs that I have a body.\nWhen I have no body,\nWhat calamity do I have?\n\n*Noble* means *difficult*.\nThe body is the root of great calamity,\nYet scholars of the world find it difficult to endure great calamity,\nBut not difficult to have a body.\n\nThus, the Sage guides them to find difficulty in having a body,\nKnowing that when having a body is difficult,\nGreat calamity departs.\n\nNature, in relation to man,\nCannot be increased by life or diminished by death.\nIts vastness can fill heaven and earth,\nIts subtlety can traverse water and fire, enter metal and stone—\nNo thing can harm it.\n\nYet the world suffers from losing its original nature,\nAnd only values the body.\nSeeing the depth of love for the body,\nThings begin to harm it.\n\nThe changes of life and death, sickness and health\nAssail from within,\nThe changes of honor and humiliation, gain and loss\nAssail from without—\nThere is not a single thing that is not calamity.\n\nOnly the enlightened know that nature cannot be destroyed,\nAnd that the body is not real.\nSuddenly forgetting the body,\nAll the world’s calamities vanish,\nThen one can traverse the world without burden.\n\n**Zhào** said:\nZhào said that the greatest calamity is having a body,\nThus, annihilating the body to return to non-being—\nThis is the realm of the Two Vehicles.\n\nThose who discuss the Dao take\nNot being shocked by honor and humiliation,\nAbandoning the body and extinguishing wisdom\nAs the ultimate standard.\nHow could they know the Sage’s true intent?\n\n**Zhènghé** said:\nTo grasp power and authority,\nTo monopolize rewards and punishments,\nTo create blessings and threats—\nThe world fears them like deities,\nReveres them like Heavenly Sovereigns—\nThis is called *noble*.\n\nThe Sage does not burden himself with nobility,\nThus he can long preserve nobility without calamity.\n\nIt is like the human body:\nFalling into limbs, losing clarity,\nSeparating from form, abandoning wisdom,\nUniting with the Great Harmony—\nThen there is nowhere one does not find oneself at ease.\n\nThe world’s people exchange nature for things,\nThus they are burdened by things and forget their power;\nThey burden the mind with the body,\nThus they lose the mind and cannot forget the body—\nTheir calamity is great.\n\nEven death and life are great,\nYet they bring no change to oneself.\nHow much more so with the gains and losses of fortune and misfortune!\n\nThis is why the ancient Perfect Ones\nDid not burden the form with advantage,\nDid not burden the mind with the body,\nAnd when viewing all things with themselves,\nThey could find no choice—\nThen the body was not their own.\n\nAbove, they played with the Creator,\nBelow, they made companions of those beyond life and death,\nBeyond beginning and end—\nWhat calamity could I have?\n\nHonor is what the world esteems,\nYet they consider it humiliation;\nNobility is what people desire,\nYet they consider it calamity.\n\nTruly, external things are unreliable—\nThis is the natural order.\n\nIf one truly possesses them with non-possession,\nThen though honored, there is no humiliation,\nThough noble, there is no calamity.\n\nThus, to value the body for the world\nIs like being able to entrust the world;\nTo love the body for the world\nIs like being able to commit the world to it.\n\nMen pursue power and wealth,\nDrown in riches and nobility,\nAnd risk danger without regret—\nThey wish only to enrich the body.\n\nNow, if one bestows the world upon them as a salary,\nAnd burdens them with the responsibility of the body,\nThen their forgetting of the body will be complete.\n\nThus, if one entrusts the world to them as such,\nEven the vastness of the world cannot weary them.\n\nGovernance in harmony with the Dao states:\nThe world is a great vessel—\nOnly the Dao can set it in motion;\nThe world is a divine vessel—\nOnly the Dao can hold it fast.\n\nThe Sage embodies the Dao,\nSo in yielding to the world, the world finds joy in being led\nAnd never tires of it.\n\nThose who follow, knowing their own worth,\nYet do not degrade themselves to serve things,\nCan be entrusted with the world—\nKnowing their love for the body,\nYet do not harm themselves in its constraints,\nCan be relied upon with the world.\n\nThus it is said:\nThe true Dao begins with cultivating oneself,\nIts threads extend to governing the state,\nAnd its roots reach to ruling the world.\n\nYet the world’s so-called gentlemen\nEndanger their bodies and abandon their lives\nTo chase after things—\nIs this not tragic?\n\nGuang states:\nThings are a burden to the body,\nThe body is a burden to the Dao.\nTo forget things is to preserve the body,\nTo forget the body is to fulfill the Dao.\n\nThough they forget external encumbrances,\nTheir love for nobility and worth still remains—\nThey can be entrusted and relied upon.\n\nWhen both body and things are forgotten,\nAnd one takes the Dao upon themselves,\nThey contain the world within the world.\n\nZhao states:\nIf one treats the world’s burdens as their own,\nThen they forget nobility and worth,\nAnd thus can be entrusted and relied upon to govern the world.\n\nThe ancient Sages,\nThough seated in the honored position of the ruler,\nSaw themselves as mountain forest hermits,\nUnmoved by sounds and colors, riches and nobility—\nThen the world could not burden them.\n\n**Chapter Fourteen: The Formless Form**\nWhat is unseen when viewed is called *Yi* (平),\nWhat is unheard when listened to is called *Xi* (希),\nWhat is untouched when grasped is called *Wei* (微).\n\nThese three cannot be summoned or invited,\nSo they merge and become one.\n\nWhat is seen when viewed is color.\nYet what allows color to be seen\nIs the unseen itself.\n\nWhat is heard when listened to is sound.\nYet what allows sound to be heard\nIs the unheard itself.\n\nWhat is obtained when grasped is touch.\nYet what allows touch to be obtained\nIs the untouchable itself.\n\nThough wise men cannot question these three,\nThey must merge and return to one\nBefore it can be so.\n\nThis so-called \"one\" is *Xing* (性),\nAnd the three are its manifestations.\n\nMan begins with *Xing* alone—\nYet when it entangles with things,\nIt splits and scatters,\nBecoming sight, hearing, and touch.\nThey use it daily without reflecting on its source,\nAnd when it merges back into one,\nThey grow ever more distant from it.\n\nIf one extends this further,\nThen the Buddha’s teaching on the six senses is the same.\nThe *Shoulengyan* Sutra says:\n*\"Reverse the flow to attain oneness—\nThe six functions then cease.\"*\n\nThis is what is meant.\n\nZhao states:\n*\"Yi\"* (平), *\"Xi\"* (希), *\"Wei\"* (微), *\"Yi\"* (一)—\nAll are strong names for the Dao.\n\nThe Dao’s subtle essence\nConfounds the mind and cannot be known,\nSilences the tongue and cannot be spoken—\nHow could it be perceived through sight, hearing, or touch?\n\nCommon men see only color,\nHear only sound—\nThis is not true knowing.\n\nIf one attains the seeing of the unseen,\nAnd sees not with the eyes but with the ears;\nIf one attains the hearing of the unheard,\nAnd hears not with the ears but with the eyes—\nThen the eyes become like ears,\nThe ears become like noses,\nAnd the six senses intermingle—\nThis is Zhuangzi’s *Qi-ting* (气听),\nAnd Liezi’s *Shi-ting* (视听).\n\nWithout relying on ears and eyes,\nThey merge and become one.\n\nAbove, it does not blaze,\nBelow, it does not fade.\n\nAll things with form\nAre adorned by yin and yang,\nSo their brilliance above and dimness below cannot be evaded.\n\nYet the Dao,\nThough present above, does not blaze,\nThough present below, does not fade—\nIt cannot be traced through forms or numbers.\n\nLu states:\n*\"Above, it shines like the sun and moon—\nIts light does not blaze;\nBelow, it rests like tiles and rubble—\nIts clarity does not fade.\"*\n\nContinuous without end—\nIt cannot be named.\nContinuous, it runs without cessation.\n\nMen see its ceaseless motion,\nAnd assume there must be a thing—\nYet they do not know it ultimately returns to nothingness.\n\nThis is called the form of the formless,\nThe image of the imageless—\nThe *Huanghuang* (惚恍).\n\nThe form of its manifestation,\nThe image of its subtlety—\nThe formless form, the imageless image—\nNone of these are truly without.\n\nThe named \"having\" and \"not having\" cannot be defined—\nThis is called *Huanghuang* (惚恍).\n\nLu states:\n*\"Continuously running without cessation,\nIt cannot be named—\nThough it undergoes myriad transformations,\nIt ultimately returns to nothingness.\nYet the Dao’s true essence is refined,\nNot truly without substance—\nBut it cannot be grasped by sight, hearing, or touch,\nSo it is called the form of the formless,\nThe image of the shapeless.\nWhen spoken of as form, it seems vague as nothingness,\nWhen spoken of as image, it seems indistinct as somethingness.\"*\n\nTo confront it, one does not see its beginning,\nTo follow it, one does not see its end.\n\nThe Dao is present everywhere—\nThus there is no beginning or end to be seen.\n\nLu states:\n*\"Its origin is unknown,\nSo one does not see its beginning;\nIts conclusion is unfathomable,\nSo one does not see its end.\"*\n\nTo hold the ancient Dao\nAnd use it to govern the present.\n\nIf one knows the ancient beginning,\nThis is called the Dao’s thread.\n\nThe ancient is where things originate,\nThe present is where things exist—\nThus the ancient is the \"not having\" of things,\nAnd the present is the \"having\" of things.\n\nTo hold that from which they originate,\nThen their advance and retreat, their swiftness and slowness,\nAre all within oneself.\n\nLu states:\n*\"Only those who hold the ancient Dao of non-action\nAnd wield it against the present’s pretenses of action\nCan return to purity and simplicity,\nAnd restore themselves to the initial state of the ancient past.\nTo know the ancient purity and simplicity,\nThis is the great Dao’s framework.\"*\n\nLü states:\n*\"This so-called 'ancient' is not different from the present—\nIt is the knowing of the ancient’s origin.\nThis so-called 'present' is not different from the ancient—\nIt is the knowing of the present’s source.\nIf one truly knows the ancient’s origin,\nThen one knows the present’s source—\nThe beginning has no origin,\nThe source has no source—\nThis is called the thread of the boundless Dao.\"*\n\n**Chapter Fifteen: The Ancient Art of the True Gentleman**\nThe ancient true gentleman\nWas subtle, profound, and mysterious—\nDeep beyond recognition.\n\nCoarse and yet subtle,\nSubtle and yet profound,\nProfound and yet mysterious—\nWhen mysterious, he was boundless in his understanding,\nYet deep beyond recognition.\n\nThe True Gentleman’s Conduct\n\nSince it is beyond recognition,\nHe must feign its outward form:\nCautious as one crossing a winter river—\nAlert before moving, this is called *yú* (豫).\nWhat he wishes to do,\nHe responds as if compelled,\nCautious as one crossing a winter river,\nHesitant as if unavoidable—this is called *yóu* (犹).\nWhat he does not wish to do,\nHe delays and resists,\nHesitant as if fearing his neighbors’ gaze—this is called *yóu* (犹).\nSolemn as if adorned,\nRespectful in all things,\nNever failing in decorum—this is called *yǎn* (俨).\nDissolved as ice about to melt,\nKnowing all things arise from illusion,\nNever clinging to anything—this is called *huàn* (涣).\n\n**Zhènghé says:**\n*\"Water congeals into ice, ice melts back into water—\nIn essence, they are one.\nThose who cling to one aspect are like water congealed,\nThose who harmonize with the whole are like ice released.\"*\n\n**Dun (敦):**\nThick as uncarved wood—\nWhen all artifice is exhausted,\nHe returns to his true nature.\n\n**Zhènghé says:**\n*\"Dun means the utmost depth.\nNature is inherently profound,\nLike uncarved wood before it becomes a vessel.\"*\n\n**Kuàng (旷):**\nVast as a valley—\nEmpty yet receptive to all.\n\n**Zhènghé says:**\n*\"Kuàng means the utmost breadth.\nThe heart’s source is boundless,\nLike a valley’s emptiness,\nReceiving and responding.\"*\n\n**Hún (浑):**\nTurbulent as mud—\nDull his light,\nBlended with dust,\nNot differing from things.\n\nWho can clarify mud by stillness?\nWho can bring life by motion?\nCommon men are drowned by things,\nTheir nature muddied, never cleansed.\nEmaciated men cling to stillness,\nTheir nature stilled, never revived.\n\nNow knowing mud obscures the nature,\nHe stills it—stillness brings clarity.\nKnowing annihilation harms the Dao,\nHe moves it—motion brings vitality.\n\n*The Classic of Changes* says:\n*\"Motionless yet responsive,\nSensing and thus harmonizing with all things—\nThis is the way.\"*\n\nThose who uphold this Dao\nDo not seek fullness.\nFullness arises from excess,\nMuddy and unable to clarify,\nStilled and unable to revive—\nThis is fullness.\n\nOnly by not being full\nCan one avoid the flaw of newness.\nAll things decay—\nOnly by not being full\nDoes decay not bring renewal.\n\n**Pán says:**\n*\"The enlightened one\nClarifies mud through enduring stillness,\nRevives vitality through enduring motion,\nAnd does not seek fullness—\nThus, no flaw of newness arises.\"*\n\n---\n**Chapter Sixteen: The Chapter of Attaining Ultimate Emptiness**\n\nAttain ultimate emptiness,\nGuard steadfast stillness.\n\nIf emptiness is not ultimate,\nThere remains something unvanquished.\nIf stillness is not steadfast,\nMovement persists.\n\nThough hills and mountains recede,\nDust particles remain—\nThis is not ultimate or steadfast.\n\nTo *attain* emptiness while *storing* emptiness\nIs still not free of substance.\nTo *guard* stillness while *storing* stillness\nIs still entangled in movement—\nHow much more so for others?\n\nIt is difficult to demand the use of emptiness and stillness\nWithout attaining their extremes.\n\n**Guāng says:**\n*\"Emptiness is a state of dependence.\nTo attain ultimate emptiness is to sever dependence—\nSevering dependence means being empty even amid substance.\"*\n\n*\"Stillness is the counterpart of movement.\nTo guard steadfast stillness is to eliminate its counterpart—\nEliminating the counterpart means being still even amid movement.\nThus, without attaining emptiness and stillness,\nOne cannot illuminate the Dao.\"*\n\n**Zhènghé says:**\n*\"Emptiness suffices to receive all things,\nStillness suffices to respond to all movement.\nTo attain emptiness while grasping its reality,\nTo guard stillness until it is steadfast—\nThen though myriad forms arise,\nMy heart remains ever clear;\nThough myriad changes occur,\nMy heart remains ever tranquil—\nThis is called *heavenly harmony*.\"*\n\nAll things arise together,\nI observe their return.\n\nWith ultimate emptiness and steadfast stillness,\nI observe the transformations of all things,\nThus not being disturbed by change.\n\nKnowing all arising must return,\nIf I were now also to act with all things,\nI could not comprehend it.\n\n**Guāng says:**\n*\"Before things arise, there is no thing.\nThings arise from the non-arising and act together.\"*\n\n**Lù says:**\n*\"Thunder originates within the earth—\nThis is the return of heaven and earth;\nMovement arises within stillness—\nThis is the return of the Sage.\"*\n\n**Zhènghé says:**\n*\"Things’ generation\nHas a source in their sprouting,\nAnd an end in their return.\nWhen they act together,\nThey trend toward the path of movement’s emergence,\nI observe the stillness of those in motion,\nThe return of those who emerge,\nAnd thus perceive the heart of heaven and earth—\nInteracting with things yet not transforming with them,\nThis is called observing their return.\"*\n\nAll things, myriad and confused,\nEach return to their root.\nAll things arise from nature,\nAll things return to nature—\nLike flowers and leaves growing from a root and returning to it,\nLike waves and tides arising from water and returning to it.\n\n**Guāng says:**\n*\"All things, myriad and confused,\nLike water forming waves.\nEach returns to its root,\nLike waves returning to water.\"*\n\nReturning to the root is stillness—\nIf one cannot spontaneously return to nature,\nEven halting movement and ceasing thought to seek stillness\nIs not stillness.\n\nOnly by returning to the root\nIs stillness attained.\n\n**Guāng says:**\n*\"The Dao is the root of movement and stillness.\nThe root is neither movement nor stillness—\nNeither movement nor stillness is the utmost stillness.\"*\n\nStillness is called returning to the *Ming* (命).\n*Ming* is the subtlest aspect of nature.\nNature can be spoken of,\nBut *Ming* transcends speech.\n\n*The Classic of Changes* says:\n*\"Exhaust reason, fulfill nature, and reach *Ming*.\"*\n\nThe Sage’s study of the Dao\nMust begin with exhausting reason,\nProceed with fulfilling nature,\nAnd end with returning to *Ming*.\n\nRitual, music, propriety, and benevolence—\nThese are the Sage’s means of interacting with things.\nBut the use of these seven—\nMust know their *why*.\n\nNot knowing their *why*,\nOne follows their names mechanically—\nThis is the common man.\nKnowing their *why* before acting—\nThis is the gentleman—\nThis is called exhausting reason.\n\nThough one exhausts the heart to exhaust reason,\nOnly then does one attain it.\nWithout seeking, one does not obtain it.\n\nThings press forward daily,\nOne must seek before responding—\nThen effort is labored,\nAnd achievement is slight.\n\nThe Sage is not obscured by externals,\nHis nature serene—\nWithout striving, he is correct;\nWithout thinking, he attains;\nThings arrive, and he responds—\nThis is called fulfilling nature.\n\nThough this is my very nature,\nYet there remains the distinction between self and other—\nThen one is nearly deluded.\n\nThe ruler’s decree is called *Ming*,\nHeaven’s decree is called *Ming*—\nTo interact with things through nature while unaware of its being mine,\nIs to entrust it to *Ming*—\nThis is called **restoring *Ming***.\n\n**Restoring *Ming*** is called **constancy**.\nWhen it manifests,\nEven the vastness of Heaven and Earth, mountains and rivers—\nNothing remains unaltered or uncorrupted.\nYet **constancy** lies only in restoring to nature,\nAnd thus remains serene and eternally present.\n\nKnowing **constancy** is called **clarity**.\nIf one does not take restoring nature as **clarity**,\nThen all is merely the common man’s cleverness—\nThough he may claim **clarity**, it is not true **clarity**.\n\nNot knowing **constancy** leads to reckless action and disaster.\nNot knowing to restore nature means being moved by things—\nWithout action, there is no disaster,\nThough one may gain in the moment,\nOne loses in the long run.\n\nKnowing **constancy** is **tolerance**.\nWhen lost in delusion,\nOne insists on being right and others wrong—\nAll things become my enemies—\nHow can I tolerate them?\nIf one knows all is delusion,\nEven enemies will be pitied and spared—\nHow then could there be anything I would not tolerate?\n\n**Tolerance** is **impartiality**.\nWithout limits to tolerance,\nThe distinction between self and other vanishes—\nAnd who then remains to be partial?\n\n**Impartiality** is **sovereignty**.\nWithout limits to impartiality,\nThe world will turn and rally to it.\n\n**Sovereignty** is **Heaven**.\nWithout limits to embrace,\nEven Heaven cannot surpass it.\n\n**Heaven** is **Dao**.\nHeaven still has form—\nBut **Dao** reaches its utmost.\n\nYet even **Dao** cannot advance beyond this.\n\n**Dao** is **enduring**—\nLifelong without peril.\n\n*Zhenghe* says: **Dao** is unspoiled through ten thousand ages.\nZhao says: This chapter speaks of returning to the root, restoring *Ming*, and taking emptiness and stillness as the foundation.\n\nThe *Laozi*’s *Ming* is the *Buddha’s* *xìng*.\nOnly *xìng* is constant, without birth or death.\nKnowing *xìng* brings tolerance and impartiality.\n\nThe vulgar cling to prolonging life as *Ming*—\nThis is what Zhuangzi called the deluded schemer who kills the heart.\n\n**Chapter Seventeen: The Supreme Dao**\nThe Supreme Dao—\nThe lower knows it exists,\n\n「**Dao** resides in yielding to the world,\nYet never governs it—\nThe people do not know its workings,\nSo they only know it exists.\n\nThe next level embraces and praises it,\nUsing *virtue* and *righteousness* to govern the world—\nIts *power* can be cherished,\nIts deeds are visible—\nThus the people come to love and revere it.\nThough its name is fair,\nIts *thickness* and *thinness* begin here.\n\nThe next level fears and scorns it—\nUsing laws to discipline the people,\nYet the people are not without fear—\nWhere their strength cannot reach,\nThey scorn it.\n\nTrust is insufficient, so there is distrust.\nIf I truly trust myself,\nThen governing the world with **Dao** is enough.\nBut if I do not trust myself,\nAnd add *virtue* and *righteousness*,\nAnd burden it with laws and governance,\nThen the people will begin to distrust.\n\nEven so, they value words—\nWhen deeds are accomplished and affairs settled,\nThe people say of me: *\"This is natural.\"*\n\nThe Sage trusts abundantly—\nIn matters of speech,\nHe still prizes it, yet does not lightly utter words,\nAnd so the people trust him.\n\nWhen deeds are accomplished and affairs settled,\nThe people daily drift toward goodness and away from crime,\nYet they do not know it themselves.\n\n**Chapter Eighteen: The Great Dao is Discarded**\nThe Great Dao discards *virtue* and *righteousness*;\nWhen the Great Dao flourishes,\n*Virtue* and *righteousness* arise within it,\nYet the people do not know it.\nOnce **Dao** is discarded,\nThen *virtue* and *righteousness* appear.\n\n*Wisdom* and *cleverness* emerge, so great falsehood arises;\nThe world does not know that **Dao** suffices to nourish all things,\nYet they add *wisdom* and *cleverness* to it,\nAnd so the people begin to repay with falsehood.\n\nThe six bonds of kinship are disunited, yet there is filial *virtue* and kindness;\nThe state is in chaos, yet loyal ministers arise.\nWhen the six bonds of kinship are united,\nWho is not filial and kind?\nWhen the state is well-ordered,\nWho is not a loyal minister?\nYao was not unfilial,\nYet he alone praised Shun—\nThere was no blind father.\nI Yin and Duke Zhou were not disloyal,\nYet they alone praised Longfeng and Bi Gan—\nThere were no tyrants like Jie and Zhou.\nThe fish of a dried marsh,\nMutually warm each other with their breath,\nMutually moisten each other with their dampness—\nNot as good as forgetting each other in the rivers and lakes.\n\n**Chapter Nineteen: Discard the Sage, Abandon Wisdom**\nDiscard the Sage, abandon *wisdom*—\nThe people benefit a hundredfold;\nIt is not that *wisdom* is insufficient to know **Dao**,\nBut if the Sage and *wisdom* govern the world,\nWho would not use **Dao** to rule things?\nThe people of the world are insufficient to know the root of *wisdom*,\nYet they see its superficial aspects,\nAnd take it for cleverness in overcoming things—\nThus they rush about in its shallows,\nAnd the people begin to suffer its harm.\n\nTherefore, discard the Sage, abandon *wisdom*—\nThe people benefit a hundredfold.\nDiscard *virtue* and *righteousness*—\nThe people return to filial *virtue* and kindness;\nThere has never been one who practices *virtue* yet forsakes their parents,\nNor one who upholds *righteousness* yet places their ruler after themselves.\n*Virtue* and *righteousness* are the means to filial *virtue* and kindness,\nBut when they decline,\nThey steal the name of *virtue* and *righteousness*\nTo seek advantage in the world—\nThen sons defy fathers,\nFathers cruelly oppress sons—\nThis is the work of *virtue* and *righteousness*’s traces,\nHence the saying.\n\nDiscard cleverness, abandon profit—\nThen thieves and robbers will cease.\nCleverness is used to facilitate affairs,\nProfit is used to aid things—\nThese two are not meant for thieves,\nYet if thieves and robbers cannot act,\nThen they will not arise,\nHence the saying.\n\nThese three—\nIf they are insufficient as adornments,\nThen they must have their proper uses.\nSeeing simplicity, embracing purity—\nFew private desires, little greed.\nThe world values these three,\nYet they say the world’s unrest comes from the insufficiency of adornments.\nThus some attach them to the Sage and *wisdom*,\nSome to *virtue* and *righteousness*,\nSome to cleverness and profit—\nThey would use adornments to govern it.\n\nYet the world grows ever more unstable—\nWhy not return to their root?\nSeeing simplicity, embracing purity—\nFew private desires, little greed—\nYet the world returns to its own nature,\nEven if these three exist,\nThey have no use for them.\n\nTherefore it is said:\nI do nothing, yet the people transform themselves;\nI love stillness, yet the people become upright;\nI have no affairs, yet the people grow rich;\nI have no desires, yet the people return to simplicity—\nThis is the clarity of the Sage’s great *wisdom*,\nThe utmost of *virtue* and *righteousness*,\nThe perfection of cleverness and profit.\n\nYet Confucius used the seven *righteousnesses*, rites, and music to govern the world,\nWhile Laozi discarded and abandoned them—\nSome may say they differ.\n\nThe *Yijing* says:\nWhat is above *form* is called **Dao**,\nWhat is below *form* is called *instruments*.\nConfucius’ concern for future generations was profound,\nSo he showed people the *instruments* while concealing **Dao**,\nMaking those of average or lesser ability adhere to the *instruments*,\nSo they would not be dazzled by **Dao**,\nAnd thus not fail to be gentlemen—\nYet those of average or greater ability\nCould ascend from there on their own.\n\nLaozi was not so—\nHe aimed to clarify **Dao** and urgently sought to open people’s hearts,\nSo he showed people **Dao** while slighting the *instruments*,\nFor he believed that if scholars only knew the *instruments*,\nThen **Dao** would be hidden—\nThus he discarded *virtue* and *righteousness*,\nAbandoned rites and music,\nTo clarify **Dao**.\n\n**Dao** cannot be spoken of—\nAll that can be spoken are its semblances.\nThe enlightened use semblances to discern the true,\nWhile the ignorant cling to semblances and fall into falsehood—\nThus there are those in later ages\nWho cling to Laozi’s words to disrupt the world,\nYet those who follow Confucius have no great faults.\nThose who use Laozi’s words to attain **Dao** are not few,\nYet those who seek **Dao** from Confucius\nOften seem to have no way in.\n\nThese two Sage-Persons,\nBoth acted out of necessity—\nTo preserve one, they must neglect the other.\n\nZhao says:\nCast a stone into the sea,\nIt must reach the bottom or else—\nIf it does not reach the bottom,\nThere is no way to measure the sea’s depth.\nSpeaking of **Dao** must reach the point before things began to exist,\nOr else there is no way to see **Dao**.\n\n**Chapter Twenty: The Extremes of Governance**\nWhen governance is at its peak,\nThe Sage and *wisdom* are discarded;\nWhen it is established,\nThings and affairs are not discarded—\nHow much less the Sage and *wisdom*?\n\n**Chapter Twenty: Discard Learning, No Worries**\nDiscard learning, no worries.\nThe more one studies, the more one gains—\nYet the more one follows **Dao**, the more one loses.\nNot knowing the rectitude of *nature* and *command*,\nYet seeking gain through study—\nWhat has not been heard before,\nAccumulated without end,\nYet lacking what unifies it—\nThen it harms the square with the round,\nThe straight with the crooked,\nAnd within it, all is in turmoil,\nYet they cannot escape their worries.»\n\n**On the Scholar’s Plight and the Sage’s Way**\n\nThe scholar’s woe lies in reaching this state,\nThus it is said: *Discard learning, no worries.*\n\nYet the Sage never ceases to learn,\nBut takes **Dao** as his primary focus.\nNot learning does not diminish him,\nNor does excessive learning disrupt him—\nSerene and without worries,\nWhy would he need to discard learning?\n\nGuang remarked:\n*\"The unenlightened scholar* calculates good and evil,\nHoping for practical use—\nThis is the minor use of what is useful.\n*The one who discards learning* knows the unity of life and death,\nEquates gain and loss,\nMoves without attachment—\nYet remains unperturbed—\nThus, no worries—\nThis is the major use of what is truly useless.\n\nZhao remarked:\n*\"To practice learning is called 'hearing' (闻),\nTo discard learning is called 'neighboring' (邻).\nBeyond these two lies true excess.\nThen, beyond discarding learning, there is still higher ground to ascend.\nHow far apart are 'only' (唯) and 'yes' (阿)?\nHow distant are good and evil?\n\nScholars drown in what they hear,\nUnable to unify it—\nThus, 'only' becomes excessive deference,\nAnd 'yes' becomes arrogant presumption,\nFar beyond mere comparison—\nHow much more so the stark contrast of good and evil?\n\nOnly the Sage knows all things share the same *nature*,\nYet arise from illusion.\nLike drawing horses and oxen,\nOr carving tigers and pigs—\nNone reflect their true forms.\nErased, they lose all distinction of right and wrong,\nSame or different—\nWho can measure their separation?\n\nIf one knows this,\nThen all things flourish together without harm,\n**Dao** flows in parallel without contradiction,\nAnd reason finds no cause for astonishment.\n\nWhat people fear,\nOne must not fail to fear.\nThe Sage balances self and others,\nUnifies same and different—\nHis mind clings to nothing,\nYet does he neglect the world’s laws,\nTransgressing boundaries of propriety and reason?\nNo.\n\nWhat people do, I also do.\nWhat people fear, I also fear—\nThough I stand among rulers and subjects,\nParents and children,\nAnd move within the realm of ritual and music,\nGovernance and punishment,\nThe world knows no difference in me.\n\nYet I do not entangle myself in things,\nFor my resolve is already set.\n\nZhenghe remarked:\n*\"The Sage drums all things into existence yet does not share their worries—\nThis is **Dao**.\nJoys and calamities with the people—\nThis is governance.\nThose who embody **Dao** have no worries,\nThose who engage in governance have fears.\nWhat people fear, yet the Sage does not take as warning—\nFew can avoid calamity.\nThus the Sage cultivates through fear and reflection.*\n\nBoundless, its end is unfathomable.\nAll follow their known paths,\nThus rigidly they do not stray beyond their limits.\nThe Sage traverses both existence and nonexistence—\nNonexistence cannot be entered,\nYet he remains boundless in his ascent.\n\nZhao remarked:\n*\"Su’s explanation of *naming-teachings* (名教) is correct.\nBut speaking of **Dao**,\nWhat people fear—\nTo assent with 'only' and reject with 'yes'—\nThis is good, yet not evil,\nFor they have not forgotten good and evil,\nNor unified right and wrong.\nDiscarding learning brings no worries—\nBoundless, its end is yet to be reached.\nBelow, it is said that he alone differs from the crowd—\nThis is clear.\n\nThe crowd rejoices like feasting on the grandest sacrifice,\nLike ascending spring platforms in delight—\nI alone remain tranquil, yet unmanifest,\nLike an infant before it can speak.\nEach person indulges in their preferences—\nTheir joy is like feasting on the grandest sacrifice,\nTheir delight like ascending spring platforms—\nBlindly they follow, unaware of their error.\n\nThe Sage delves deep into their illusions,\nEncounters them with calm indifference—\nLike an infant before it can speak.\n\nUnassuming, as if belonging nowhere.\nRiding the *nature* of all things without selfishness,\nThus, as if belonging nowhere.\nThe crowd all have excess,\nI alone seem to have cast it aside.\nThe crowd clings to their known truths,\nEach believing they possess what is more than enough.\nThe Sage encompasses all things without favoring one,\nTranscending, as if having cast it all aside.\n\nZhenghe remarked:\n*\"Achievements overshadow the world,\nYet I do not claim them as my own.\nFoolish heart of mine—\nPure and simple.\nPure and simple, yet not truly foolish.\nZhenghe remarked:\n*The Sage’s natural faculties remain unstrained,\nYet silently align with **Dao**.\n\nThe crowd are bright and clear,\nI alone seem dim and obscured—\nThe crowd are sharp and discerning,\nI alone am muddled and vague.\nThe common folk take distinctions as knowledge,\nThe Sage knows all illusions are insufficient for debate—\nThus, outwardly he seems obscured,\nInwardly he seems muddled.\nSudden, as if in darkness,\nSilent, as if without end.\nSudden, as if in darkness—\nNo sight of his limits.\nSilent, without purpose—\nNo sight of his resting place.\nThe crowd all have their talents,\nI alone seem dull and coarse.\nEach person has their abilities,\nThus the world employs them all.\nThe Sage’s talents are complete, his virtue fulfilled—\nYet he seems without ability,\nThus doubted as dull and coarse.\n\nI alone differ from the people,\nYet hold dear the *Mother of all* (食母).\n**Dao** is the mother of all things.\nThe crowd follow things and forget **Dao**,\nWhile the Sage abandons all things,\nTaking **Dao** as his ultimate principle—\nLike an infant eating nothing but its mother’s milk.\"*\n\n**Chapter Twenty-One: The Virtue and Manifestation of the Dao**\n\nThe virtue of the Dao follows only from the Dao itself.\nThe Dao is formless—\nYet when it moves, it manifests as virtue,\nAnd thus takes on appearance.\nTherefore, virtue is the visible aspect of the Dao.\n\nExtending this further,\nAll things’ appearances are the Dao manifesting in them.\n\nThe Dao, as a thing,\nIs vague and indistinct.\nVague and indistinct—\nYet within it, there are forms.\nIndistinct and vague—\nYet within it, there are things.\n\nThe Dao is neither being nor non-being,\nThus it is spoken of as vague and indistinct.\nYet when it moves and forms shapes,\nWhen it settles and becomes things,\nNone escape its origin in vagueness and indistinctness.\n\nMysterious and dark—\nYet within it, there is essence.\nAt the juncture of being and non-being,\nVague and indistinct yet unseen,\nWhen being and non-being intermingle,\nIts mystery and darkness become profound and boundless—\nThough not yet formed, its essence abides within.\n\nIts essence is most true,\nAnd within it, there is authenticity.\nWhen things take form,\nTruth and falsity become mixed.\nWhen essence is pure,\nFalsity cannot intrude.\n\nOnce truth and falsity are mixed,\nFrom one it becomes two,\nFrom two it becomes three—\nChaotic and entangled,\nNo longer trustworthy.\n\nWhen essence is pure,\nIt does not deceive me.\n\nFrom ancient times to now,\nIts name does not fade—\nIt observes all transformations.\nThough ancient and modern differ,\nThe Dao does not fade,\nThus it is called *unfading*.\nOnly because it never fades\nCan it observe all transformations.\n\n*Fú* means beauty.\nThough all things are beautiful,\nThey cannot escape change.\nHow do I know all transformations are thus?\nBy this.\n\nThe Sage knows how all things are\nBecause he embodies the Dao and does not depart from it.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Two: Conformity Brings Wholeness**\n\nConformity brings wholeness—\nThe Sage acts only in accordance with principle.\nWhere principle lies,\nIt may be straight or curved,\nBut the key is harmony alone.\nThus, it does not conflict with things,\nAnd so it is whole.\n\nCrookedness becomes straight—\nStraightness without principle is not true straightness.\nThough crookedness follows principle,\nIt is the most straight in the world.\n\nHollow becomes full—\nWhere all gather, it is low.\nThough one may wish to avoid fullness,\nIt cannot be avoided.\n\nExhaustion brings renewal—\nBright and clear is not the Dao.\nMuddled and obscured—\nYet daily renewal arises from this.\n\nFewness brings attainment—\nThe Dao is one.\nAttaining one means attaining all.\nExcess brings confusion—\nMany studies without unity bring confusion.\n\nThus, the Sage holds to *One* as the model for all under heaven.\nHolding to *One* is returning to nature.\nFor conformity brings wholeness,\nCrookedness becomes straight,\nHollow becomes full,\nExhaustion brings renewal,\nFewness brings attainment,\nExcess brings confusion—\nAll are remnants of holding to *One*,\nThus it concludes with *Holding to One*.\n\n**Ye** says:\nConformity brings wholeness, hollow becomes full, necessity brings attainment—these are principle;\nCrookedness becomes straight, exhaustion brings renewal—these are natural forces.\nCrookedness is not sought for straightness,\nYet extreme crookedness must become straight.\nExhaustion is not sought for renewal,\nYet extreme exhaustion must bring renewal.\nPrinciple and force complement each other,\nSometimes forming beginnings and ends,\nSometimes alternating gain and loss—\nChaotic and inexhaustible,\nYet the Sage alone can hold to *One*,\nNot changing with them,\nThus making it the model for all under heaven.\n\nNot self-appearing, thus clear—\nThe eye does not see itself,\nThus it can see things.\nThe mirror does not illuminate itself,\nThus it can illuminate things.\nIf it were to see and illuminate itself,\nIt would have no time for anything else—\nHow could it attend to things?\n\nNot self-asserting, thus manifest—\nNot self-praising, thus功成 (*gōngchéng*—achievement fulfilled);\nNot self-exalting, thus enduring.\nOnly because it does not contend,\nNone under heaven can contend with it.\n\nNot self-appearing, not self-asserting, not self-praising, not self-exalting—\nAll are remnants of non-contention,\nThus it concludes with *non-contention*.\n\nThe ancients spoke of *conformity brings wholeness*—\nWas this empty speech?\nTruly, it is whole and returns to this.\n\nThe world takes straightness as right,\nCurvedness as wrong,\nYet if one follows principle in the world,\nThere will be no avoiding curvedness,\nThus the chapter concludes:\nIs this empty speech?\nTruly, it is whole and returns to this.\n\nWhat is called *whole* is not merely preserving oneself—\nInternally, it preserves oneself;\nExternally, it preserves things.\nPreserving both self and things,\nReturning to nature—\nThen its straightness is great.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Three: Rare Speech and Naturalness**\n\nRare speech, naturalness.\nSpeech arising from naturalness\nIs simple yet precise.\nIf not natural yet forced,\nIt becomes verbose and untrustworthy.\n\nThus it is said:\nWhen the Dao issues from the mouth,\nIts flavor is insipid,\nIts sight is indistinct,\nIts sound is inaudible,\nIts use is inexhaustible—\nThis is called *rare speech*.\n\n**Guang** says:\nRare speech is speech without leaving traces of speech,\nThus speech without ever speaking—\nMerging with the natural Dao, like the sound of a bird’s cry.\n\nA gust of wind does not last the morning,\nA sudden rain does not last the day.\nWho does this?\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Three: Rare Speech and Naturalness (continued)**\n\nHeaven and Earth—\nHeaven and Earth cannot endure long,\nYet how much less can mortals?\nWhen yin and yang do not contend,\nThe winds and rains come in due season,\nNeither hasty nor sluggish,\nExpending their force fully before ceasing.\nBut when yang surges upward and yin sinks downward,\nWhen blocked and unable to vent,\nThen come the gusting winds and torrential rains.\nThough they may rage, their force cannot last a day.\nThe sages of old spoke sparingly,\nActed with ease,\nAll following their natural course—\nThus enduring without exhaustion.\n\nThe world may weary of this,\nPreferring deceitful words to please the ear,\nOr startling deeds to dazzle the eye,\nYet they know not why such things cannot last.\n\n**Zheng He** says:\nHeaven and Earth shape the myriad things—\nThe wind scatters them, letting all forms transform naturally,\nThe rain nourishes them, allowing all things to flourish on their own.\nThus they neither over-generate nor over-prompt,\nYet all things thrive between Heaven and Earth—\nThis is why they endure long.\n\nBut gusting winds and sudden rains bring discord to yin and yang,\nAnd if forced, they bring harm—\nThus they cannot last.\nTherefore, those who follow the Dao:\nThose aligned with the Dao gain the Dao;\nThose aligned with virtue gain virtue;\nThose aligned with loss gain loss.\nThose aligned with the Dao obtain the Dao;\nThose aligned with virtue obtain virtue;\nThose aligned with loss obtain loss.\n\nConfucius said:\nIf one’s resolve is in *ren* (benevolence),\nThere is no evil—\nThus it is said: *\"The faults of the virtuous are easily pardoned.\"*\nIf resolve in *ren* is thus,\nHow much more so for those resolved in the Dao?\n\nIf one truly follows the Dao,\nThose who align with it gain the Dao,\nThose who align with virtue gain virtue—\nEven if they err, though they lose in their actions,\nThey must still gain in virtue and Dao.\n\n**Zhao** says:\nThe true aligns with the true,\nThe false aligns with the false—\nIlluminating the obscure, harmonizing the hidden,\nOne with its true nature,\nNeither gain nor loss,\nNeither purity nor defilement,\nEnlightenment and ignorance equal.\nFaith insufficient, doubt arises.\nThose who do not know the Dao\nHave shallow faith in it,\nAnd when they err, they doubt it—\nThus their doubt only grows.\nOnly those who truly know the Dao\nDo not let gain or loss shake their faith.\n\n**Pan** says:\nDescend into *rare speech*,\nAnd one loses the constancy of life and nature—\nInsufficient faith will surely lead to disbelief.\n\n**Zhao** further says:\nThis chapter on the Dao’s subtlety should be understood through **Zhao’s** words,\nYet the text’s flow is disjointed.\nLet me explain:\n*Rare speech and naturalness*—this is the foundation of discussing the Dao.\nOnly when virtue and Dao are lost\nDo *ren*, *yi*, *li*, and *zhi* arise.\nIf one truly follows the Dao,\nWho speaks of gain or loss?\nBut later generations, lacking sincerity,\nDoubt—\nLike gusting winds and sudden rains,\nWhich could never last a day.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Four: The Limping Cannot Stand**\n\nThe limping cannot stand,\nThe striding cannot walk.\nThe self-admiring are blind,\nThe self-righteous are unillustrious,\nThe self-praising achieve nothing,\nThe self-conceited do not endure.\n\nNo one can stand and walk at once—\nIf one deems standing and walking insufficient\nAnd adds striding or limping,\nNone can preserve their standing or walking.\nThe same applies to self-admiration,\nSelf-righteousness,\nSelf-praise,\nAnd self-conceit.\n\n**Zheng He** says:\nTo limp and seek to stand,\nTo stride and seek to walk—\nThis defies nature’s constancy,\nAnd the body’s ease is hard to achieve.\nTo see oneself is to lack wisdom to encompass all things—\nThus one is blind.\nTo insist on being correct is to lack benevolence to unite the many—\nThus one is unillustrious.\nTo possess virtue yet lose it through boasting—\nThus one achieves nothing.\nTo boast of one’s abilities yet lose them through arrogance—\nThus one does not endure.\nIn the Dao, this is called *\"excess food, superfluous actions.\"*\nLike eating and drinking—\nWhen sated, one stops;\nExcess brings illness.\nLike the four limbs—\nWhen complete, they suffice;\nSuperfluity becomes a burden.\nSome may despise this,\nYet those who follow the Dao do not dwell there.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Five: The Indeterminate Oneness**\n\nThere is an indeterminate Oneness,\nBorn before Heaven and Earth.\nThe Dao is neither clear nor turbid,\nNeither high nor low,\nNeither departing nor arriving,\nNeither good nor evil—\nYet it coalesces into form,\nIn humans, this is called *xing* (nature).\nThus it is said: *There is an indeterminate Oneness.*\n\nNone know its origin—\nIt is tranquil, ever-present,\nAnd from it, Heaven and Earth arise.\n\n**Guang** says:\nThe Dao cannot be divided—*indeterminate*.\nNo effort—*coalesces*.\nNo beginning—*born before*.\n\nThe formless form,\nExisting alone before Heaven and Earth.\n\n**Zheng He** says:\nHeaven and Earth also depend on this to arise—\nThus it is said: *Born before Heaven and Earth.*\n\nSilent and vast,\nIndependent yet unchanging,\nCirculating yet unexhausted—\nIt can be the Mother of all beneath Heaven.\n\nSilent, with no sound,\nVast, with no form—\nIndependent, unmatched, yet never varying,\nCirculating among all things, yet never failing—\nDescending to nurture the myriad creatures,\nThus it is their Mother.\n\n**Guang** says:\nDetached from dependence—*independent*.\nTrue and constant—*unchanging*.\n\n**Zheng He** says:\nUntouched by motion,\nUninvolved with things—\nTranquil, and that is all.\nGreat constancy sustains it,\nUnchanging with all things.\n\nSpeaking of the Dao’s essence:\nIts utility flows in and out,\nComing and going without end—\nSpeaking of the Dao’s function:\nAll things rely on it to live.\n\nI do not know its name—\nI call it *Dao*,\nAnd forcefully name it *Great*.\n\nThe Dao originally has no name—\nThe Sage saw that nothing exists without it,\nThus named it *Dao*.\nSeeing nothing can surpass it,\nThus forcefully named it *Great*.\nYet in truth, it cannot be named.\n\n**Guang** says:\nBeyond measure—*Great*.\n*Great* means *passing away*,\n*Passing away* means *distant*,\n*Distant* means *returning*.\nSeeking it from *Greatness*,\nIt has already passed and gone—\nSeeking it from *going*,\nIt is distant and unreachable.\nThough it passes, though it is distant,\nYet seeking it in return,\nA single mind suffices.\n\n**Lu** says:\nThe Dao is forcefully named *Great*,\nYet in truth, it has already passed and grown distant.\n\n「Its departure is not distant—\nIt lies in knowing its *return*,\nIn naming *return* to match reality,\nIn acting to align with principle.\n\n**Guang** says:\nA solitary movement without abiding is *passing away*,\nReaching the utmost while utterly detached is *distant*,\nTo approach while ever more distant,\nTo withdraw while ever more near—\nThis is *returning*.\nThus, the Dao is *Great*,\nHeaven is *Great*,\nEarth is *Great*,\nAnd the Sage is *Great*.\nWithin the realm, there are four *Great* things,\nAnd the Sage occupies one of them.\n\nHumans follow Earth,\nEarth follows Heaven,\nHeaven follows the Dao,\nThe Dao follows **Nature** (*zìrán*).\nSpeaking in terms of the Dao,\nEven Heaven, Earth, and the Sage are insufficient to be *Great*.\nYet people universally recognize the *Greatness* of the three,\nAnd do not believe in the Dao’s *Greatness*—\nThus, I tell them of reality:\nHumans are not as *Great* as Earth,\nEarth is not as *Great* as Heaven,\nHeaven is not as *Great* as the Dao,\nThe Dao is not as *Great* as **Nature** (*zìrán*).\nYet if one recovers their true nature in a single day,\nThen these three *Great* things,\nHumans can fully comprehend them.\n\n**Lu** says:\nThe realm’s \"cloud\" refers to the Dao’s non-existence beyond the six directions.\n**Guang** says:\nThe Three Realms (*sān cái*) follow the Dao—\nThe end does not depart from the beginning,\nAnd **Nature** (*zìrán*) is the Dao itself.\nAbandoning the Dao’s forced name,\nWe reveal the utmost principle of **Supreme Mystery** (*zhòngxuān*).\n\n**Zhao** says:\nSome ask the recluse of Zhongtiao, Yuan Yong, saying:\nWhen speaking of the Dao, one already touches upon it—\nYet to say \"the Dao\" is to depart from the Dao itself.\n\n---\n**Chapter Twenty-Six: The Heavy as the Root of the Light, Stillness as the Lord of the Restless**\n\nThe heavy is the root of the light,\nStillness is the lord of the restless.\nIn all things, the light cannot bear the heavy,\nThe small cannot restrain the great,\nThe unmoving makes the moving move,\nThe unstirred controls the stirred—\nThus, the light relies on the heavy as its root,\nThe restless on stillness as its lord.\n\nTherefore, the Sage moves all day without departing from their burdens.\nThough there are palaces and towers of splendor,\nTheir dwelling surpasses them in stillness.\nTo move while light yet not depart from burdens—\nThough palaces bring joy, one must still dwell in stillness,\nFor the necessity of heavy and stillness is thus.\n\nHow can the ruler of a great realm\nLighten themselves against the world?\nIf the ruler lightens their body to bear the world,\nThey will be insufficient to bear the world.\n\nTo lighten is to lose ministers,\nTo be restless is to lose the Sage.\nTo lighten or be restless without remedy is futile—\nYet if the Sage lightens themselves, ministers know they cannot rely on them,\nIf ministers are restless, the Sage knows their minds are set on gain—\nThus it is said: To lighten is to lose ministers,\nTo be restless is to lose the Sage.\n\n**Zhao** says:\nThe ancients called elevated brilliance \"observation.\"\nThe towers and palaces of brilliance—\nThough there are palaces of splendor,\nTheir dwelling surpasses them in stillness—\nThis illustrates stillness, like the Southern Honor (*Nánróng*).\n---\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Seven: The Virtuous Movement Leaves No Trace, The Virtuous Speech Knows No Flaw**\n\nThe virtuous movement leaves no trace—\nMoving in accordance with principle,\nThus leaving no trace.\n**Guang** says:\nMounting with the rear wheels first,\nDriving with spirit-horses—\nThis is without fixed timing,\nThat is without fixed place,\nHow can there be traces?\n\nThe virtuous speech knows no flaw—\nSpeaking only when necessary,\nThus their words fill the world without error.\n**Guang** says:\nThe Perfect One in speech—\nTheir lips murmur, and the response is clear;\nNo attachment to truth or meaning,\nThey speak as if in a dream,\nThey speak and forget their speech—\nHow can there be flaws or censure?\n\nThe virtuous calculation does not rely on tallying tools—\nAll things’ numbers are laid out before them,\nYet they know without calculation—\nHow need they tallying tools?\n**Guang** says:\nEven dust fills the Earth,\nEven drops complete the sea,\nYet to exhaust the Dao and know all things—\nTo know one and thus know ten thousand—\nWhat need for tallying tools?\n\nThe virtuous closure requires no bolt or key to be unopened,\nThe virtuous binding needs no rope or knot to be undone.\nA person of complete virtue—\nToward all things,\nLike a mother to her child,\nThough they let them go, they do not depart—\nThus, no bolt is needed to close,\nNo rope is needed to bind.\n\nTherefore, the Sage always knows how to rescue people—\nThus, they abandon no one;\nAlways knows how to rescue things—\nThus, they discard nothing.\nTo rely on calculations for planning,\nTo set bolts for closure,\nTo hold ropes for binding—\nTheir reach is limited.\n\nThe Sage toward humanity—\nNot only does they tolerate them,\nBut also knows how to rescue them;\nI abandon no one—\nHow can people not return to me?\nThis is called *cloaking brilliance* (*xímíng*).\n\nRescuing people from peril and hardship—\nThis is not the greatest rescue.\nWhen they drift through life and death,\nWhen obscured by things,\nAnd I impart my utmost clarity to them,\nMaking the dark ones bright—\nLike lamps passing on light without ceasing—\nThen this can be called the greatest rescue of people.\n\nThus, the good person is the teacher of the not-good,\nThe not-good person is the resource of the good.\nThe Sage does not cherish their teacher,\nNor does the world love their resource.\nThe Sage does not love their resource—\nBecause they do not cling to teaching;\nThe world does not cherish their teacher—\nBecause they do not cling to learning.\nThe Sage does not merely forget the world,\nBut also makes the world forget them.\n\nThough wisdom is vast and confused,\nThis is called *essential mystery*.\nThe Sage’s mystery—\nEven the wise may not fully comprehend.\n\n**Guang** says:\nWhen sickness persists, medicine remains—\nWhen sickness abates, medicine departs—\nMedicine and sickness both depart—\nHumans follow the twofold forgetting—\nGreat awakening as if in confusion—\nThis is the *essential mystery*.\n\n---\n**Chapter Twenty-Eight: Knowing Its Masculine**\n\nKnow its masculine,\nHold to its feminine,\nTo be a valley for the world.\nTo be a valley for the world,\nTheir constant virtue does not depart—\nReturning to the state of the infant.\nKnow its purity,\nHold to its darkness,\nTo be a model for the world.\nTo be a model for the world,\nTheir constant virtue is unerring—\nReturning to the state of **Supreme Mystery** (*wújí*).\nKnow its glory,\nHold to its shame,\nTo be a basin for the world.\nTo be a basin for the world,\nTheir constant virtue is sufficient—\nReturning to the state of **Simplicity** (*pǔ*).\n\nMasculine and feminine,\nAre the first and last that reach us.\nDarkness and purity,\nAre the bright and dim that reach us.\nGlory and shame,\nAre the noble and base that reach us.\nTo desire the first while hating the last,\nTo desire the bright while hating the dim,\nTo desire the noble while hating the base—\nThis is the nature of things.\nYet the first and last reaching us,\nAre not as pressing as the bright and dim,\nThe bright and dim reaching us,\nAre not as deep as the noble and base.\n\nThe ancient Sages abandoned delusion to seek recovery of their true nature—\nThe clearer their nature,\nThe lower their guard;\nThe lower their guard,\nThe thicker their virtue;\nThe thicker their virtue,\nThe greater their return.»\n\nThe cover of ignorance without action\nIs not as profound as knowing yet refraining—this is the utmost.\n\nTo know the **masculine** while holding to the **feminine**—\nThis is the knowing of nature.\n\nWhen knowing nature, the will to contend ceases,\nAnd all who strive to be first shall return to it,\nLike water rushing to a ravine—none depart.\n\nYet still, like an infant,\nIt can receive but not yet employ—\nThus it is said: *\"Return to the infant.\"*\n\nTo know the **white** while holding to the **black**—\nThis is the seeing of nature.\n\nDwelling in darkness yet perceiving brightness,\nAll who are bright cannot escape its form.\n\nThus, when myriad lights follow it as law,\nThough responding to all things,\nIts law never errs,\nIts use never exhausts—\nThus it is said: *\"Return to the Uncarved (Wuji).\"*\n\nTo know **glory** while holding to **shame**—\nThis is the recovery of nature.\n\nWhen all delusions are exhausted,\nDwelling in shame yet without resentment,\nVast as the emptiness of a valley,\nThings come and it responds.\n\nVirtue is sufficient here—\nPure nature, unmixed—\nThus it is said: *\"Return to Simplicity (Pu).\"*\n\nSimplicity dispersed becomes **vessels**;\nThe Sage employs them as **officials and leaders**—\nThus the great principle does not sever.\n\nThe Sage, having returned to Simplicity,\nDisperses Simplicity into vessels\nTo respond to all things.\n\nLike a sovereign dividing governance to establish officials,\nIt follows the natural course of affairs—\nThough governed, there is no severance.\n\n**Political Harmony** says:\nThat which is above form is called **Dao**,\nThat which is below form is called **vessels**.\n\nThere are names and distinctions,\nThere are divisions and responsibilities—\nWhen Dao is whole, Heaven and humanity unite as one;\nWhen vessels are dispersed, Heaven and humanity separate as two.\n\n**Zhao** says:\nThe earlier passage speaks of *\"Returning to Simplicity\"*—\nSimplicity is the completeness of Dao;\nSeverance means division into two things—\nThus the great principle does not sever.\n\n---\n**Chapter Twenty-Nine: \"Those Who Would Take the World\"**\n\nThose who would take the world and do so,\nI see they cannot but fail.\n\nThe Sage’s possession of the world\nIs not a taking—\nAll things return to it;\nUnable to refuse, they receive it.\n\nTheir governance of the world\nIs not an imposition—\nThey follow the natural course of things,\nRemoving only their harm.\n\nIf one takes and imposes,\nIt cannot be achieved.\n\nThe world is a divine vessel—\nIt cannot be forced.\n\nTo force it brings ruin;\nTo grasp it brings loss.\n\nAll things cannot be forced—\nEven among a hundred people,\nIf they do not follow their nature and act arbitrarily,\nThere will surely be discord and resistance—\nHow much more so the world?\n\nYet small things, few in number,\nMay be taken by force or seized by cunning,\nBut the world, with its divine master,\nIf not allowed to return naturally, will rebel;\nIf not permitted to govern itself, will fall into chaos.\n\nThus things either move or follow,\nEither warm or cool,\nEither strengthen or weaken,\nEither complete or destroy.\n\nTherefore the Sage avoids excess,\nAvoids extravagance,\nAvoids imbalance.\n\nYin and yang surge against each other,\nHigh and low tilt each other,\nGreat and small govern each other.\n\nSome move ahead,\nSome follow behind,\nSome warm with breath,\nSome chill with draft,\nSome nourish and strengthen,\nSome diminish and weaken,\nSome complete and form,\nSome ruin and destroy—\nAll are the natural course of things,\nAn inescapable force.\n\nYet the foolish of the world,\nSelfishly seeking gain,\nWould resist and defy it—\nTheir ruin is either sudden or gradual.\n\nThe Sage, knowing it cannot be reversed,\nFollows and awaits it,\nAvoids excess,\nAvoids extravagance,\nAvoids imbalance,\nSo that nothing oversteps and harms things—\nAnd the world knows no calamity.\nThis is the utmost of *not-forcing*.\n\nThough Yao and Tang could not escape droughts and floods,\nThey never reached ruin—\nThis is why.\n\nThe *I Ching*’s **\"T'ai (泰)\"** says:\n*\"The later sage completes Heaven and Earth’s way,\nAssists and harmonizes their suitability,\nTo govern the people on the left and right.\"*\n\nThree yang within, three yin without—\nThings have reached their utmost fullness.\n\nThe Sage fears overreach and harm to life,\nThus completes and assists it,\nSo that nothing oversteps—\nThis is called *avoiding excess, avoiding extravagance, avoiding imbalance*.\n\n---\n**Chapter Thirty: \"Assisting the Sovereign with Dao\"**\n\nTo assist the sovereign with Dao\nIs not to use force to dominate the world—\nIts affairs return naturally.\n\nThe Sage uses force only when unavoidable.\nIf not unavoidable, yet desiring to dominate the world,\nThough they may succeed,\nTheir ruin will surely return—\nKing Ling of Chu, King Mo of Qi, Qin Shi Huang, and Emperor Wu of Han,\nSome perished themselves,\nSome brought ruin to their descendants.\n\nWhat men abhor,\nThe spirits detest—\nNone escape.\n\nWhere armies tread,\nThorns grow.\nAfter great armies,\nThere are years of famine.\n\nWhere force is used,\nCivil affairs decay—\nFields lie fallow.\nAfter war,\nKilling qi prevails—\nHarvests are ruined.\n\nAll force is thus—\nHow much more so when used to dominate the world?\n\nThus the good decide only when necessary,\nDaring not to take by force.\n\n*\"Decide\"* means to resolve.\nWhen virtue cannot pacify,\nWhen governance cannot subdue,\nOnly then does one resort to force as a last measure.\n\nDecide without arrogance,\nDecide without boasting,\nDecide without pride,\nDecide only when unavoidable—\nThis is to decide without force.\n\nNot arrogance, not boasting, not pride, unavoidability—\nThese are the ways of *not-forcing*.\n\nThings in vigor age—\nThis is called *not-Dao*,\nAnd *not-Dao* perishes early.\n\nThe vigorous must age—\nThere is no exception.\n\nOnly the Dao-complete\nAchieve while appearing incomplete,\nAre full while appearing empty,\nNever grow vigorous, thus never age,\nNever die.\n\nTo dominate the world with force—\nHow vigorous it is—\nYet how can it avoid aging?\n\n---\n**Chapter Thirty-One: \"The Fine Weapon\"**\n\nThe fine weapon—\nAn ominous instrument,\nThings often detest it,\nThus the Dao-complete do not dwell upon it.\n\nIt is used to resolve crises,\nNot as a constant.\nThus they do not dwell upon it.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Two: \"The Dao Ever Nameless\"**\n\nThe noble one, when at rest, honors the left;\nWhen wielding arms, honors the right.\nThe weapon—an ominous instrument—\nIs not the instrument of the noble one.\nUsed only when unavoidable,\nSerenity and simplicity are supreme.\n\nTo triumph without delighting in it—\nYet those who delight in victory are those who love to kill.\nHe who loves to kill\nCannot prevail in the world.\n\nAuspicious matters honor the left,\nInauspicious matters honor the right.\nThus, the Assistant General takes the left,\nThe Supreme General takes the right,\nAnd is treated with funeral rites.\nWhen many are slain, they are lamented with sorrowful weeping,\nAnd victory is treated with funeral rites.\n\nThe Dao ever nameless—\nThough crude and small,\nThe world dares not submit to it.\nIf lords and kings could guard it,\nAll things would come as guests of their own accord.\n\nCrude—this is their nature.\nThe Dao ever nameless,\nThus their nature too cannot be named.\n\nTherefore, when expanded, it is nowhere absent;\nWhen contracted, it does not fill the slightest space—\nThis is why, though small, it cannot be subdued.\n\nEven the lowliest man, if he guards it,\nMay refine himself with dust and dregs\nTo the stature of Yao and Shun.\nYet lords and kings, though exalted, cannot guard it,\nAnd all things refuse to come as guests.\n\nHeaven and Earth unite,\nDescending sweet dew—\nNo one commands it, yet it is evenly distributed.\nThe pure *qi* ascends and descends,\nUniting as one,\nDescending sweet dew—\nGently covering all things,\nWithout fail or omission.\n\nThe sage embodies the Perfect Way\nTo respond to all things,\nLike sweet dew reaching everywhere—\nThis is how he can make all things come as guests.\n\nWhen names were first established,\nNames having been established,\nOne must also know when to stop—\nKnowing when to stop is how one avoids peril.\n\nThe sage disperses the crude to form instruments,\nUsing instruments to establish names—\nHow could he abandon the crude for names,\nOr pursue the superficial and lose the root?\n\nIndeed, he knows to return to his nature,\nThus he rides through all transformations without peril.\n\nCompare the Dao in the world\nTo valleys and rivers with the sea.\nThe sea is the bell of water;\nValleys and rivers are its branches.\nThe Dao is the origin of all things;\nAll things are its branches.\nAll are water, so valleys and rivers return to their bell;\nAll are Dao, so all things come as guests to their origin.\n\nZhao said: All sayings speak of all things coming as guests to the Dao,\nLike valleys and rivers returning to the sea.\nBing Wen alone differed, saying:\nIf so, it should be said, \"All things come as guests to the Dao,\nLike rivers returning to the sea.\"\nJiang He and Ma Dan doubted the character *with* (与),\nAnd changed it to *rush toward* (赴)—both incorrect.\n\nI privately think this chapter speaks of the Dao originally having no name,\nThen names being established—\nFor the sun, moon, stars, mountains, grasses, and trees.\nThe sage uses them,\nEstablishing officials and titles—\nThough names differ, they are all one Dao.\n\nLike water in the world:\nAs valleys, as rivers, as seas—\nThough forms differ, they are all one water.\nThe scholar must forget names\nAnd return to the nameless crude—\nThus, \"One must also know when to stop\"—\nTo stop at the Dao.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Three: \"Knowing Others is Wisdom\"**\n\nKnowing others is wisdom,\nKnowing oneself is enlightenment.\nDiscrimination is wisdom,\nExhaustive understanding is enlightenment.\nAs long as discrimination remains,\nOne stops at knowing others but cannot know oneself.\nWhen understanding is exhaustive,\nOne knows oneself and can also extend to others.\n\nHe who overcomes others is strong,\nHe who overcomes himself is powerful.\nStrength can reach others but not oneself;\nTo conquer oneself and restore one’s nature—\nThis is beyond the reach of strength,\nThus he may be called powerful.\n\nHe who knows contentment is rich.\nHe who finds sufficiency in what he encounters\nIs never without wealth.\nThough he possess the world,\nIf he dwells there with a heart of perpetual lack,\nHe will never be rich.\n\nThe resolute in action have willpower—\nNot contending with things,\nYet ever striving without ceasing,\nNo one can take away their resolve.\n\nHe who never loses his foundation endures long.\nThings change without constancy,\nYet the heart never strays—\nThis is enduring long.\n\nHe who dies yet does not perish is long-lived.\nThe transformation of life and death is great,\nYet nature remains undiminished—\nThis is how the ancient sages achieved neither life nor death.\n\nShi said:\nTo live without living is endurance;\nTo die without dying is longevity.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Four: \"The Great Dao Flows\"**\n\nThe Great Dao flows—\nIt can be left or right.\nFlowing, it knows neither \"can\" nor \"cannot,\"\nThus left and right, up and down,\nCirculating without bound.\n\nGuang said:\nIts \"can\" is also \"cannot.\"\nThe Great Dao cannot be fixed or demanded,\nCannot be grasped through opposition.\nAll things rely on it to live yet it does not claim them;\nIts deeds accomplished, it does not name itself.\n\nIn the world, there are those who give life yet do not claim it—\nThey will surely name it as their own;\nThere are those who avoid things yet do not possess them—\nThey will surely reject them and fail to sustain life.\nTo give life yet not claim,\nTo accomplish yet not possess—\nOnly the Dao does this.\n\nIt clothes all things yet is not their master,\nThus it ever lacks desire—\nIt may be called *small*.\nAll things return to it yet it is not their master—\nIt may be called *great*.\nThus the sage never claims greatness,\nAnd so achieves true greatness.\nGreat yet without the heart of greatness—\nThen it is small.\n\nZheng He said:\nIt covers all things yet does not display its sovereign power,\nThus it is not their master.\nIt stirs and guides the multitude yet no trace of their return is seen,\nThus it is unknown as their master.\nThe Dao is not one to be named as great or small—\nWhen it is said \"may be called,\" it refers to the Dao’s reach to things.\n\nMencius said:\nTo transform greatly is called sagehood.\nTo transform greatly, then how could there be the burden of greatness?\nThus he achieves true greatness.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Five: \"Holding the Great Image\"**\n\nHolding the Great Image,\nThe world comes toward it.\nThe Dao is neither being nor non-being,\nThus it is called the Great Image.\nIf it were clearly manifest,\nThere would be both likeness and difference—\nThose who like it come,\nThose who dislike it go,\nAnd it cannot make all things come toward it.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Six: \"The Principle of Withdrawal\"**\n\nTo go forth without harm,\nPeace and tranquility are secured.\nIf there are likes and dislikes,\nThen there are benefits and harms.\nWhen likes and dislikes are exhausted,\nThen toward all things it does no harm.\nThus the arriving find no want of peace,\nNo want of balance,\nNo want of ease.\n\nMusic and bait—\nPassing guests are detained.\nThe Dao, when spoken of,\nIs bland as though without flavor.\nTo look upon it, insufficient to see;\nTo listen, insufficient to hear;\nTo use it, it cannot be exhausted.\nYet if one composes music and sets bait\nTo await those who come,\nHow could it not suffice to detain passing guests?\nYet when the music ends and the bait is spent,\nThey will abandon it and depart.\n\nBut if one holds the Great Image to await the world,\nThe world does not know to love it—\nHow much less would it know to hate it?\nThough it lacks fragrance, taste, form, color, or sound to please people,\nIts use cannot be exhausted.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Seven: \"The Dao’s Ever-Non-Action\"**\n\nThe Dao is ever in non-action,\nYet nothing remains undone.\nTo act in all things while maintaining non-action—\nThis is the intent of non-action.\n\nIf lords and kings could guard this,\nAll things would transform of their own accord.\nWhen transformation begins to stir,\nI shall govern it with the nameless Primordial Simplicity.\n\nThe Sage transforms all things through non-action.\nThings transform through it,\nBeginning with non-action and gradually reaching action.\nTake, for instance, the eldest brother’s growth—\nPeople rise artificially,\nThus the decline of the Three Dynasties,\nAnd the ever-worsening changes in human nature.\nWhen their stirrings begin,\nAnd those above and below all grow dissipated,\nTheir transformations become so extreme as to be beyond speech.\nIf, when their stirrings arise, one does not act to move them,\nAnd instead restrains them with the nameless Primordial Simplicity,\nPerhaps it may be possible to halt them.\n\nThe nameless Primordial Simplicity\nWill also not desire.\nThrough non-desire and stillness,\nThe world will naturally rectify itself.\n\nThe Sage harbors no thought of clinging to the Primordial,\nNor displays any trace of it externally,\nThus the Primordial is preserved and its power is vast.\nIf the heart still clings to the Primordial within,\nIt is already far from attaining it.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Eight: \"The Dao’s Constant Non-Action\"**\n\nThe Dao is constantly in non-action,\nYet nothing remains undone.\nTo act in all things while maintaining non-action—\nThis is the meaning of non-action.\n\nIf lords and kings could guard this,\nAll things would transform of their own accord.\nWhen transformation begins to stir,\nI shall govern it with the nameless Primordial Simplicity.\n\nThe Sage transforms all things through non-action.\nThings transform through it,\nBeginning with non-action and gradually reaching action.\nFor example, the growth of the eldest brother—\nPeople rise artificially,\nThus the decline of the Three Dynasties,\nAnd the ever-worsening changes in human nature.\nWhen their stirrings begin,\nAnd those above and below all grow dissipated,\nTheir transformations become so extreme as to be beyond speech.\nIf, when their stirrings arise, one does not act to move them,\nAnd instead restrains them with the nameless Primordial Simplicity,\nPerhaps it may be possible to halt them.\n\nThe nameless Primordial Simplicity\nWill also not desire.\nThrough non-desire and stillness,\nThe world will naturally rectify itself.\n\nThe Sage harbors no thought of clinging to the Primordial,\nNor displays any trace of it externally,\nThus the Primordial is preserved and its power is vast.\nIf the heart still clings to the Primordial within,\nIt is already far from attaining it.\n\n**Leaf’s Commentary:**\nThe transformations of things cannot be fully exhausted.\nIt seems as though there is one who, though appearing to do nothing,\nYet pushes and moves all things.\nThus, when one sees expansion, one does not know where withdrawal is intended;\nWhen one sees strength, one does not know where weakness is intended.\nThe same applies to ruin and revival, giving and taking.\nThough subtle, this can be made clear—\nThis is how softness conquers hardness,\nHow weakness conquers strength.\n\nThe Sage’s way in the world\nAlso has its own unfolding,\nYet it cannot be shown to people—\nThus it is called a sharp instrument.\n\n**Zhao’s Commentary:**\nThe *Kaiyuan* [commentary] claims the Sage employs stratagems—\nThis is incorrect.\nWisdom and insight are already abandoned;\nHow much more so deceit and trickery?\nThe *Lü* and *Su* schools say that such principles exist in things—\nThis is close.\nLeaf’s view—that there seems to be a Creator who pushes and moves all things,\nTo prove the meaning of softness conquering hardness—\nThis is correct.\nWhat is called a sharp instrument,\nIs it not the very softness and weakness?\n\n**Chapter 38: The Virtue of the Highest Virtue Does Not Virtue**\n\nThe highest virtue does not cling to virtue—\nThus it has virtue.\nThe lower virtue clings to virtue—\nThus it lacks virtue.\n\nThe Sage lets his heart’s desires unfold without overstepping bounds,\nNot because he intentionally seeks virtue—\nVirtue arises naturally.\n\nThose of lesser wisdom recognize virtue’s worth\nAnd strive to attain it without loss,\nYet they merely preserve themselves—\nWhat true virtue do they possess?\n\nThe highest virtue acts without action yet achieves without effort.\nThe lower virtue acts and yet still strives for achievement.\nTo act without action yet still strive for achievement—\nThis is still action.\n\nThose of lesser wisdom cannot succeed without effort,\nYet they still strive for achievement—\nNot mere empty action without method.\n\n**Zheng’s Commentary:**\nNot thinking yet attaining,\nNot striving yet hitting the mark,\nNot acting yet arriving—\nThis is the virtue of the highest.\n\nNot thinking yet failing to attain,\nNot striving yet missing the mark,\nNot acting yet failing to arrive—\nThis is the virtue of the lower.\n\nThe highest benevolence acts without striving for achievement,\nThe highest righteousness acts while still striving for achievement.\nBenevolence and righteousness alike do not force their way—\nBenevolence triumphs by not striving for achievement,\nRighteousness succeeds by striving for achievement.\n\nVirtue has high and low,\nYet benevolence and righteousness have only high—no low—\nWhy so?\n\nThe lower virtue lies between benevolence and righteousness,\nAnd those who fall below righteousness—\nNeed not be spoken of further.\n\nThe highest ritual acts yet meets no response,\nSo it rolls up its sleeves and enforces it.\nFrom virtue descending to ritual,\nThis is how the Sage governs the people—\nTo the utmost.\n\nThus, when action meets no response,\nIt rolls up its sleeves and compels it.\nWhen compulsion still meets no response,\nThen punishments arise and arms are raised—\nThis is mere empty action without method.\n\nThus, when the Way is lost, virtue follows,\nWhen virtue is lost, benevolence follows,\nWhen benevolence is lost, righteousness follows,\nWhen righteousness is lost, ritual follows.\nRitual, though thin in loyalty and trust,\nIs the beginning of chaos.\n\nLoyalty and trust without ritual—\nThey remain unseen.\nRitual established, their excellence shines outward.\nBetween ruler and subject, parent and child,\nHusband and wife, friends—\nTheir brilliance is dazzling, yet their substance is empty.\n\nFollow it and order prevails;\nDefy it and chaos ensues.\nThe gap between order and chaos—\nNarrower than a hair’s breadth—\nThus it is called the beginning of chaos.\n\n**Foreknowledge** is the flower of the Way,\nYet the start of folly.\n\nThe Sage gazes deeply into all things,\nJudging right and wrong, gain and loss—\nAll laid out before him,\nLike sunlight revealing form,\nSeeing all without distinction of before or after.\n\nCommon folk see only with their eyes,\nHear only with their ears,\nThink only with their minds,\nLost among all things,\nExhausting their intelligence to perceive—\nThough they call it wisdom,\nThey know not that folly begins with self-assurance.\n\nThus, the noble man abides in substance, not in superficiality,\nIn reality, not in ornament—\nHence he discards the latter for the former.\n\nThe vulgar man delights in what he gains below,\nForgetting what is above—\nThus he rejoices in superficiality and abandons substance.\nWho but the noble man can discard the latter for the former?\n\n**Lu’s Commentary:**\nWhen loyalty and trust weaken within,\nRitual is established to prevent chaos—\nThus ritual is called the beginning of chaos,\nNot that ritual itself is the beginning of chaos.\n\nForeknowledge is the flower of virtue and morality,\nManifesting outwardly, it elevates ritual to guide the foolish—\nNot that wisdom is the start of folly.\n\nBenevolence, righteousness, ritual, and wisdom—\nThese are tools suited to their times.\nTo govern the present by the past,\nOne must root oneself in the substance of virtue and morality.\nTo transform the present and return to the past,\nOne must begin with ritual,\nFlowing downstream to return to the source.\n\n**Zhao’s Commentary:**\nThe Sage’s intent in holding to the past to govern the present\nWas to gradually restore the governance of non-action.\nThus he first expounds on virtue and morality,\nThen confuses benevolence and righteousness,\nAnd finally clarifies ritual and music—\nThis gradual approach inevitably leads to harsh laws and governance,\nA natural consequence of his words.\n\nCommon scholars thus scorn benevolence and righteousness,\nDestroy ritual and law,\nBelieving that without benevolence and righteousness, chaos reigns,\nAnd without ritual and law, how long before all become beasts?\nThis is why the scholars of Jin and Song abandoned themselves,\nUntil their nation fell and they perished without knowing it.\n\nHow could they know the Sage’s true intent\nOr Laozi’s original discussion of ritual?\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 39: The One of Old**\n\nThe One of old—\nHeaven gains the One and thus is clear,\nEarth gains the One and thus is tranquil,\nThe Spirit gains the One and thus is numinous,\nThe Valley gains the One and thus is full,\nAll things gain the One and thus live,\nThe sovereign gains the One and thus governs the world.\n\nThe One—this is the Way.\nAll things exist as they do because of the Way.\n\nPeople of the world see things yet forget the Way—\nHeaven knows only its clarity,\nEarth knows only its tranquility,\nThe Spirit knows only its numinosity,\nThe Valley knows only its fullness,\nAll things know only their living,\nThe sovereign knows only his governance—\nYet they do not know that all this comes from the Way.\n\nIf Heaven loses the One, it nearly shatters,\nIf Earth loses the One, it nearly erupts,\nIf the Spirit loses the One, it nearly fades,\nIf the Valley loses the One, it nearly drains,\nIf all things lose the One, they nearly perish,\nIf the sovereign loses the One, he nearly falls.\n\n*\"Nearly\"* means the extreme is reached.\n\nHeaven, though it loses the One, does not yet shatter,\nEarth, though it loses the One, does not yet erupt,\nThe Spirit, though it loses the One, does not yet fade,\nThe Valley, though it loses the One, does not yet drain,\nAll things, though they lose the One, do not yet perish,\nThe sovereign, though he loses the One, does not yet fall—\nYet the extreme is still this.\n\nThus, the noble is rooted in the lowly,\nThe high is founded on the lowly.\nHeaven and Earth’s grandeur,\nThe sovereign’s nobility—\nAll are the result of the One.\n\nNow, what is this One?\nWhat is it?\n\nIt cannot be seen, yet it is present—\nIt cannot be grasped, yet it is there—\nThis is the utmost subtlety under Heaven,\nThis is what is called *lowly* and *base*.\n\nThus, the sovereigns of old styled themselves *\"Orphan\"* and *\"Lonely\"*—\nWas this not to take the lowly as their root?\nThose who once used such titles\nMerely took their root while abandoning their branches.\n\nTherefore, when gathering the many into a carriage,\nThey did not desire it to gleam like jade,\nNor to clatter like stone.\nThe spokes, the hub, the axles, the yokes, and the crossbars—\nWhen assembled, they form a carriage.\nEach part can be counted,\nYet the carriage itself cannot be counted—\nOnly then does one know that *non-being* makes the carriage.\nThis is what is called *\"using non-being for utility.\"*\n\nNow, does Heaven and Earth become Heaven and Earth by being vast?\nDoes the sovereign become a sovereign by being noble?\nWithin the vast and the noble, there is still the One preserved—\nThis is how they become Heaven and Earth, how they become sovereigns—\nYet none know how it is accomplished.\n\nThus, the One dwells in nobility yet is not noble,\nDwells in baseness yet is not base—\nUnlike jade, which gleams and cannot be made base,\nOr stone, which is base and cannot be made noble.\n\nZhao said: All interpretations teach *\"carriage\"* as *\"car\"*, but the meaning is not yet settled. I suspect it aligns with the common view.\n*\"Carriage\"* and *\"platform\"* are terms for the lowly—\nThe earlier text spoke of attaining the One,\nThis speaks of gathering the many.\n\n*\"The many without the many\"* is like saying *\"all are carriage-makers, yet no carriage-maker\"*—\nNo carriage-makers, no sovereigns either.\n\nThe Master of Chongcheng said: *\"Without days, there are no years\"*—\nThis is the same intent.\n\nThey did not wish to be like jade, gleaming and polished,\nNor like stone, rough and unrefined—\nThough noble and base differ in name,\nTheir unity is far beyond such distinctions.\n\nYet I dare not claim this as my own—\nI merely await future sages.\n\nThe *Rhapsody of King Lü* speaks of *\"carriage\"* as praise—\nThis is also close to being forced.\n\n---\n**Dao/Way’s Movement: The Fourth Chapter of \"The Dynamic of Inversion\"**\n*The inversion of Dao/Way is its dynamic motion...*\n\n**Dao/Way’s Movement: The Fourth Chapter of \"The Dynamic of Inversion\"**\n*The inversion of Dao/Way is its dynamic motion...*\n\n---\n\n**The Return to Nature Brings Stillness**\nWhen nature is restored, stillness ensues.\nYet though it remains motionless and tranquil,\nWhen stirred, it flows through all things—\nThis is where movement originates.\n\nFuxi said: *\"Return to the root, and stillness arises; stillness alone can move.\"*\n\nThe Dao’s use lies in its weakness.\nFormless, soundless, the Dao is the weakest of all things beneath heaven—\nYet nothing surpasses its strength.\nThis is how it governs all things.\n\nAll things arise from *having*, yet *having* arises from *non-being*.\nThe world fails to grasp stillness as movement,\nOr weakness as strength—\nThus I speak of their origin.\n\nFor all things beneath heaven,\nThere is the known principle of mother governing child,\nYet never the child governing mother.\n\n**The Noble Hear the Dao**\nThe superior hear the Dao and diligently practice it;\nThe mediocre hear the Dao and cling to it uncertainly;\nThe lowly hear the Dao and laugh at it—\nIf they do not laugh, it is not the Dao.\n\nThe Dao is neither form nor visible,\nNeither sound nor audible.\nIt precedes all things, vast and unobstructed,\nYet its clarity is doubted.\nThus the lowly scorn it as absurd and laugh;\nThe mediocre doubt it, clinging to it as if it might vanish;\nOnly those who see it clearly\nDiligently practice and embrace it without weariness.\n\nConfucius said: *\"When I speak to him, he does not lose my meaning—*\nThis is Zilu.\"\nHow like the superior!\n\nThe *Record of Established Speech* says:\n*\"Establish\"* means to found.\nThe ancients established such speech,\nAnd Laozi took it—\nThis is what the lowly expounds.\n\n**The Manifestation of the Dao**\nThe Dao is bright yet seems obscure—\nIt illuminates all without scrutiny.\nAdvancing the Dao seems like retreat—\nThough it does not move, nothing outpaces it.\nLeveling the Dao seems like unevenness—\nYet where it reaches, all is even, yet nothing is worn down.\nThe highest virtue is like a valley—\nThe highest virtue does not cling to virtue,\nLike the emptiness of a valley.\nGreat whiteness seems like shame—\nTo be white yet unsoiled is the pride of the unwashed,\nNot the saint.\nBroad virtue seems insufficient—\nWhen virtue is boundless and cannot be exceeded,\nIt stops there—this is not broadness.\nEstablishing virtue seems like laziness—\nFollowing nature’s spontaneity without contrivance,\nExternally appearing slack yet truly established.\nTrue substance seems corrupted—\nEmbodying nature and embracing spirit,\nAdapting to all things without losing its essence,\nExternally appearing flawed.\n\nThe *Politics of Harmony* says:\n*\"Not rigid—yet when polished, it does not splinter;\nNot white—yet when stained, it does not darken.*\nThe greatest square has no corners—\nPreserving its vastness, it does not cling to sharp edges.\nGreat vessels take long to form—\nTheir magnitude renders them unusable early.\nGreat music is rare in sound—\nBeyond what the ear can hear.\nGreat forms are shapeless—\nBeyond what the eye can see.\nThe Dao is hidden, nameless.\n\nOnly the Dao\nIs generous and fulfills.\nWherever the Dao meets, it is seen—\nThese twelve are its manifestations in affairs.\nYet the Dao’s completeness remains hidden in its namelessness.\nIt meets where needed, extends its abundance,\nLends where lacking—\nThus all things rely on it to complete.\n\n**Dao/Way Generates the One**\nThe Dao generates the One,\nThe One generates the Two,\nThe Two generates the Three,\nThe Three generates all things.\n\nAll things carry *yin* within *yang*,\nAnd harmonize through *chong-qi* (interpenetrating breath).\nThe Dao is neither One nor Two—\nWhen it pairs with things, the Dao is One while things are not.\nThus it is called the One, yet the Dao is not One.\n\nOne with One makes Two,\nTwo with One makes Three—\nFrom here onward, all things arise.\nThough myriad in difference,\nAll carry *yin* within *yang*,\nAnd harmonize through *chong-qi*—\nFor things arise from Three,\nAnd Three from One—\nThis is the natural order.\n\nPang said:\n*\"One is the Supreme Ultimate,\nTwo is *yin-yang*,\nThree is *chong-qi*.\"*\n\nWhat the world despises—\nThe solitary, the orphaned, the destitute—\nYet kings and lords adopt these titles.\nThe world does not know the origin of all things,\nValuing the few and small while honoring the many and great.\nYet the ancient sages knew—\nThus things may be diminished yet benefit,\nOr benefited yet diminished.\n\nWhat the world teaches,\nI also teach.\nThe overbearing do not meet a good end—\nI shall make this my lesson.\n\nThe world takes weakness as loss,\nStrength as gain—\nYet they are mistaken.\nThus I teach all beneath heaven:\n*\"Have you not seen the overbearing meet their end?\"*\nThe overbearing are the extreme of arrogance.\n\nWhen the world knows the overbearing do not escape death,\nThey will know arrogance cannot be sustained—\nThen I can speak of the Dao.\n\n**The Supreme Weakness**\nThe supreme weakness\nGallops over the supreme strength.\nNothing enters where there is no gap—\nThus I know the benefit of *wuwei* (non-action).\n\nThe teaching of the unsaid,\nThe benefit of *wuwei*—\nFew beneath heaven attain them.\n\nWith strength to counter strength,\nIt does not bend but shatters;\nWith weakness to counter strength,\nNeither weakens nor harms the strong.\nLook to water—\nThis is how.\n\nWith *having* entering *having*,\nThey repel each other;\nWith *non-being* entering *having*,\nThe *non-being* is never weary,\nThe *having* never aware.\nLook to ghosts and spirits—\nThus the sage alone can practice *wuwei*,\nAnd thus master all strength,\nEnter all *having*—\nHence the teaching of the unsaid,\nThe benefit of *wuwei*—\nFew beneath heaven attain them.\n\n**Name and Body**\nWhich is closer: name or body?\nWhich is more: body or wealth?\nTo value name above body,\nTo honor body above wealth—\nThis is still not forgetting oneself.\n\n---\n\n**The Forgotten Self**\nHe who forgets himself\nHas not even his own body,\nMuch less name or wealth.\nYet to value the body above all beneath heaven,\nOne must first forget the self.\nThus he makes all beneath heaven know\nThat name is not what should be cherished,\nThat wealth is not what should be prized—\nOnly then does one know to value the body,\nAnd only then does one know to forget the self.\nThis is the intent of Laozi.\n\nWhich is more harmful: gain or loss?\nHe who has not lost yet suffers loss as disease,\nBut when he has gained and fears losing it,\nHis suffering exceeds that of loss itself.\nOnly by balancing gain and loss,\nBy equalizing possession and deprivation,\nDoes one escape disease.\n\nThus excessive love brings great expenditure,\nExcessive hoarding brings great loss.\nThe more one loves, the more one will do to obtain it—\nHow can one avoid depletion?\nThe more one hoards, the more will seek to take it—\nHow can one avoid loss?\nKnowing sufficiency brings no disgrace,\nKnowing when to stop brings no peril—\nThus one may endure.\n\n**Chapter 45: Great Fullness as Deficiency**\nGreat fullness seems deficient,\nYet its use is unexhausted;\nGreat abundance seems empty,\nYet its use is inexhaustible.\nBeneath heaven, they call non-deficiency \"fullness,\"\nYet fullness must eventually decay;\nThey call non-emptiness \"abundance,\"\nYet abundance must eventually fail.\nThe sage seeks great fullness yet does not fear deficiency,\nAims at great abundance yet does not despise emptiness—\nThus he is full yet does not decay,\nAbundant yet does not fail.\n\nGreat straightness seems crooked,\nGreat skill seems clumsy,\nGreat eloquence seems inarticulate.\nStraight yet not crooked, it will surely break;\nFollow the Way and act, though crooked, it remains straight.\nSkillful yet not clumsy, it will surely weary;\nLet things take their natural course, though clumsy, it is skillful.\nEloquent yet not inarticulate, it will surely exhaust itself;\nSpeak according to the Way, though inarticulate, it is eloquent.\n\nAgitation overcomes cold,\nStillness overcomes heat,\nYet clarity and stillness are the true norm for all beneath heaven.\n\nTo be full yet not deficient,\nAbundant yet not empty,\nStraight yet not rigid,\nSkillful yet not cunning,\nEloquent yet not verbose—\nThis is like agitation unable to be still,\nOr stillness unable to agitate.\n\nAgitation can overcome cold but not heat,\nStillness can overcome heat but not cold—\nBoth are trapped in one extreme and not the true norm.\nOnly the serene and clear, untouched by any one thing,\nNeither full nor deficient,\nNeither abundant nor empty,\nNeither straight nor crooked,\nNeither skillful nor clumsy,\nNeither eloquent nor inarticulate—\nOnly then can one overcome all,\nAnd thus stand as the true norm for all beneath heaven.\n\n**Leaf’s Commentary:**\nCold and heat are the *qi* of heaven and earth.\nIf one here can overcome cold through agitation,\nAnd heat through stillness,\nThen knowing what one overcomes,\nWhat cannot be mastered?\nThus clarity overcomes turbidity,\nStillness overcomes movement—\nTheir effects are already evident.\nHow much more so\nDeficiency overcoming fullness,\nEmptiness overcoming abundance,\nCrookedness overcoming straightness,\nClumsiness overcoming skill,\nInarticulateness overcoming eloquence?\nYet because they do not perceive this,\nThey must seek what can overcome—\nIf they seek to overcome, it will never be the true norm.\nOnly clarity and stillness are the true norm for all beneath heaven.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 46: The Way in the World**\nWhen the Way prevails beneath heaven,\nWarhorses are turned to plowing fields;\nWhen the Way is lost beneath heaven,\nWarhorses breed in the suburbs.\n\nWhen all beneath heaven follow their proper place,\nThere is no contention, yet all is self-governed—\nThus warhorses are turned to plowing fields.\nWhen the Way is lost beneath heaven,\nWarhorses breed in the suburbs.\n\n**Governance by Harmony:**\nTo rule beneath heaven with the Way,\nThe people take joy in their labors,\nAnd there is no contention—\nOnly tilling the fields remains.\n\nNo guilt is greater than desiring what is forbidden,\nNo calamity is greater than not knowing sufficiency,\nNo blame is greater than demanding possession.\nTo show others what they may desire\nIs already guilt enough,\nBut those who do not know sufficiency\nSuffer even greater calamity,\nAnd those who demand possession\nBear the greatest blame.\n\nEven a common man, if he harbors one of these,\nWill suffer their consequences;\nA sovereign who does so\nWill surely see warhorses arise.\n\n**Lu’s Commentary:**\nThe ruler without the Way poisons all beneath heaven,\nAnd his evils are threefold:\nTo see what is desirable yet seek it without reason—\nThis guilt is the greatest.\nTo seek without ceasing—\nThis brings harm to many—\nThis calamity is the greatest.\nTo desire without fulfillment—\nThis stokes the heart further—\nThis blame is the greatest.\n\nThus, true sufficiency is always sufficient.\nTo know sufficiency in what one encounters—\nThen there is no insufficiency.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 47: Not Leaving the Door**\nWithout leaving the door, one knows all beneath heaven;\nWithout peering through the window, one sees the Way of heaven.\nThe farther one goes, the less one knows.\n\nThe *xing* as essence\nFills the universe entirely,\nWith no difference in near or far, ancient or modern.\n\nThe sages of old knew all without leaving door or window—\nOnly because their *xing* was whole.\n\nMen of the world are obscured by things,\nTheir *xing* divided by ears and eyes,\nWithin, confused by body and mind,\nWithout, blocked by mountains and rivers—\nTheir sight does not extend beyond vision,\nTheir hearing does not extend beyond listening,\nAnd even the smallest opening can obscure and cut them off.\n\nThey do not know that the sage restores *xing* and finds sufficiency,\nYet they still seek by going out—\nThus the farther they go, the less they know.\n\nObserve the body to know the body,\nUse the inner to know the outer,\nBegin with the small to know the great,\nClarify the near to understand the far.\nThus the sage acts without moving yet knows,\nSees without looking yet names,\nAccomplishes without doing.\n\nWhat *xing* reaches is not merely knowing and naming—\nIt can also follow things in their natural course,\nAchieving without effort.\n\n**Light’s Commentary:**\nEmotion seals—then stagnation;\nReason aligns—then divinity.\n\n**Lu’s Commentary:**\nWhen the sage eats, he thinks of the world’s hunger;\nWhen he dresses, he thinks of the world’s cold;\nHis love for his parents extends to the world’s elderly;\nHis love for his children extends to the world’s young—\nHe need not leave the door to know all beneath heaven.\n\nIf one loves life,\nHe knows the Way of heaven’s nurturing all things;\nIf one attends to affairs,\nHe knows the Way of heaven’s completing the four seasons;\nIf one delights in goodness,\nHe knows the Way of heaven’s favoring the virtuous—\nWhy gaze through the window to see the Way of heaven?\n\nThe Way does not act yet knows human nature intimately,\nDoes not see yet names the Dao of heaven;\nAchieves perfect governance without effort—\nThis is because it traces back to the original nature of body and mind.\n\n**Chapter 48: Daily Advancement in Learning**\nDaily advancement in learning,\nYet if one does not know the Way while diligently studying,\nAnd accumulates knowledge without unifying it,\nOne remains merely a student.\n\nConfucius said:\n*\"Much hearing, then selecting the good and following it—\nMuch seeing, then recognizing it—\nThis is the second stage of knowing.\"*\n\n**The Way of daily diminution.**\nOnce one truly knows the Way,\nGazing upon all things,\nNone escape being illusory—\nAbandon illusion to recover original nature,\nYet original nature is soon restored.\n\nConfucius said to Zigong:\n*\"Do you take me for one who hears much and remembers it?\"*\n*\"Yes,\"* he replied. *\"Is that not so?\"*\n*\"No,\"* Confucius said. *\"I grasp it with a single thread.\"*\n\nDiminish again and again,\nUntil reaching *wuwei*—\n*Wuwei* yet nothing remains undone.\nAbandoning illusion to recover nature is diminution,\nYet the mind of abandoning illusion still lingers.\nOnly when even this mind is forgotten,\nAnd nature is pure with no remainder,\nThen all is done without losing *wuwei*.\n\nDiminution is gradual:\nFirst, diminish traces,\nThen diminish the mind—\nWhen both traces and mind are forgotten,\nOne arrives at *wuwei*.\nThus, to take the world requires *wuwei*,\nYet when action arises,\nIt is insufficient to take the world.\n\nAll men harbor the desire to take the world,\nSo they create affairs to seek it.\nWhen the mind manifests externally, things resent it,\nThus it can never be attained.\n\nThe sage acts without contrivance,\nSo there are no affairs—\nHis mind manifests externally, yet things are at ease.\nThough he does not take the world,\nThe world returns to him.\n\n**Chapter 49: The Sage Has No Fixed Mind**\nThe sage has no fixed mind,\nTaking the people’s mind as his own.\nTo the virtuous, he is virtuous;\nTo the unvirtuous, he is also virtuous—\nTo the trustworthy, he is trustworthy;\nTo the untrustworthy, he is also trustworthy—\nVirtue and trust.\n\nEmpty and formless,\nYet taking the forms of all things as its forms—\nSquare when in the square,\nRound when in the round.\nIf the void itself had form,\nHow could it shape all things?\n\nThus the sage has no mind,\nTaking the people’s minds as his own—\nTo the virtuous and unvirtuous alike, he is virtuous;\nTo the trustworthy and untrustworthy alike, he is trustworthy.\nVirtue and trust lie in others,\nYet my way of being virtuous and trustworthy\nNever wavers—\nThis is called virtuous virtue.\nTrust and distrust lie in others,\nYet my way of being trustworthy\nNever changes—\nThis is called virtuous trust.\n\nOtherwise, favoring the virtuous while abandoning the unvirtuous,\nTrusting the trustworthy while abandoning the untrustworthy—\nHow could this be called\n*\"constant virtue saving all\"*?\nThus, no one is abandoned.\n\nThe sage in the world,\nDull and indistinct for the world,\nBlending his mind—\nThe people fix their ears and eyes upon him,\nYet the sage treats them like infants.\n\nThe world’s good and evil, truth and falsehood,\nEach clings to its own correctness,\nMutually condemning and harming,\nUncertain where to settle—\nThe sage worries for them,\nThus dull and indistinct, blending their minds—\nNo good, no evil,\nNo truth, no falsehood—\nHe meets all with unity.\n\nThey fix their ears and eyes,\nObserving the sage’s rewards and punishments,\nYet I meet them with the simplicity of an infant—\nNeither delighting in the good,\nNor resenting the evil—\nThus the virtuous do not grow arrogant,\nAnd the wicked do not grow angry,\nAll relax and transform,\nAnd the world begins to settle.\n\n**Leaf’s Commentary:**\nThe sage in the world\nExists yet does not govern.\n\n**Chapter 50: Birth and Death**\nBirth and death—\nNature knows neither.\nEmerging, it becomes birth;\nRetreating, it becomes death.\n\nThirteen are the companions of life,\nThirteen the companions of death,\nAnd thirteen the ways men move toward death’s ground.\n\nThose who use things to refine and nourish themselves\nAre companions of life.\nThose who indulge in sounds, colors, smells, and tastes\nAre companions of death.\n\nThese two distinguish the paths of life and death—\nYet I know action yet do not know rest,\nKnow speech yet do not know silence,\nKnow thought yet do not know forgetting—\nStriving toward exhaustion,\nThis is called moving toward death’s ground.\n\nThe paths of life and death in ten words:\nEach occupies three—\nIs it not that nine belong to life and death,\nAnd one to neither?\n\nNeither life nor death—\nThis is what the *Yijing* calls *\"still and unmoving.\"*\n\nLaozi speaks of the nine,\nYet omits the one,\nLetting men find it themselves,\nAnd entrusting the subtlety of *wuwei* and *wuwu*.\n\n**Zhenghe’s Commentary:**\nThose who associate with life and death\nAre bound to blame life while opposing reason,\nOr forget life while pursuing gain.\n\nWhen men’s lives are moved toward death’s ground,\nTheir life and death—what choice is there?\nWhy?\nBecause their attachment to life is deep.\n\nLife brings death,\nThus companions of life are companions of death.\nThe more men rely on life,\nThe more death’s path dominates—\nNineteen times out of twenty.\n\nIt is said that those skilled in preserving life\nWalk on land without encountering rhinos or tigers,\nEnter armies without bearing arms.\nRhinos have no place to thrust their horns,\nTigers no place to strike with claws,\nWeapons no place to lodge their blades.\nWhy?\nBecause they lack death’s ground.\n\nThe Perfect Man dwells always in neither life nor death—\nIf life’s ground is absent,\nHow could death’s ground exist?\n\n**Chapter 51: The Way Gives Birth**\nThe Way gives birth,\nVirtue nurtures,\nThings shape it,\nCircumstances complete it.\n\nThe Way is the mother of all things,\nThus the giver of birth is the Way.\nWhen it moves, it becomes virtue,\nTending the multitude without complaint,\nThus the nurturer of all things is virtue.\n\nYet virtue and the Way cannot shape themselves—\nThey manifest through things.\nThings cannot complete themselves—\nFar and near interact,\nHard and soft intermingle,\nAccumulating into circumstances,\nAnd the changes of rise and fall, order and chaos are realized.\n\nThus all things honor the Dao and revere virtue.\nThough form arises from things and completion from circumstances,\nWithout the Dao, nothing is born;\nWithout virtue, nothing is nurtured.\nTherefore, the Dao is honored as a parent,\nAnd virtue is revered as a sovereign king—\nFor the Dao holds no rank, yet virtue bears a name.\n\nThe Dao’s eminence, virtue’s nobility—\nNone bestow them, yet they abide naturally.\nTo rely on rank for honor and nobility\nIs not true honor and nobility.\n\nThus the Dao gives birth and nurtures,\nGrows and matures,\nCompletes and ripens,\nNourishes and shelters.\nIt births yet does not possess,\nActs yet does not rely,\nGuides yet does not dominate—\nThis is called the Mysterious Virtue.\n\n**Chapter 52: The Beginning of All Things**\nThe beginning of all things is the mother of all things.\nThe Nameless is the beginning of Heaven and Earth;\nThe Named is the mother of all things.\nWhen the Dao is yet Nameless, it is the source from which things arise;\nWhen it is Named, it is the substance from which things are born.\nThus it is called both Beginning and Mother—\nIts offspring are all things.\n\nHaving found its Mother, one knows its offspring.\nHaving known its offspring, one returns to guard its Mother—\nAnd thus, throughout life, one faces no peril.\n\nThe Sage embodies the Dao to use things,\nAs one knows the child through its Mother—\nClear and unerring in all perception.\nThough wisdom encompasses all,\nYet never does it forget the Dao,\nThus it ever guards its Mother.\n\nClose the senses, shut the gates—\nAnd one’s life remains unexhausted.\nOpen the senses, pursue affairs—\nAnd one’s life is never saved.\n\nAll under Heaven possess this Dao,\nYet they always suffer from forgetting it and serving things.\nThe eyes delight in colors,\nThe ears delight in sounds—\nOpening the heart’s desires,\nAnd using them to fulfill them—\nThus they sink their whole lives in ruin,\nAnd cannot be saved.\n\nThe Sage’s way to avoid exhaustion\nIs to close and shut them—\nNever venturing to serve them.\n\nTo see small is called clarity.\nThe harm of delight begins small yet grows great.\nKnowing it small yet becoming great,\nClose and shut it—\nThis is called clarity.\n\nTo guard softness is called strength.\nChasing what delights yet refusing it,\nOne believes oneself strong—\nBut it is not strength.\nOnly he who sees delight and fears it\nCan be called strong.\n\nUsing its light, returning to its clarity—\nNo harm befalls the body—\nThis is called following the constant.\n\nThe common man opens his desires,\nSacrificing himself to things,\nAnd never returns.\n\nThe Sage closes and shuts them—\nNot to reject things,\nBut to respond with the spirit,\nUsing its light while the self remains untouched.\n\nThe ears hear, the eyes see,\nThe nose smells, the mouth tastes,\nThe body feels, the mind thinks—\nAll are called light.\nWhen light meets things,\nThings may reach their limit,\nYet clarity is undiminished.\nThus it responds to all changes without exhaustion,\nAnd harm does not touch its body—\nHence its constant nature endures unbroken.\n\n**Chapter 53: Let Me Make This Clear**\nLet me make this clear: if I have knowledge,\nAnd walk the Great Dao,\nI must fear only my actions.\n\nOne who embodies the Dao\nHas no knowledge, no action,\nNo schemes to set in motion—\nYet things transform naturally.\n\nNow, with knowledge and action,\nWalking the Great Dao,\nThe schemes and structures I establish\nAre not its natural way—\nAnd there is cause for fear.\n\n**Zhao** says:\nTo have knowledge is to have ignorance.\nThe Sage’s heart knows nothing,\nThus it knows all.\n\nSmall knowledge is the ruin of great knowledge.\nThe Great Dao is most smooth,\nYet people love shortcuts.\nThe Great Dao is smooth and easy,\nWith no steep paths or obstacles—\nYet those who do not know\nDeem it circuitous and slow,\nAnd prefer shortcuts for speed.\n\nThus all who abandon their natural way\nAnd set schemes in motion\nAre those who seek haste.\n\nPalaces are empty,\nFields lie fallow,\nGranaries are bare.\nFine silks and sharp blades,\nGluttony in food and drink,\nExcess in wealth—\nThis is called thieving vanity.\nIt is not the Dao.\n\nThe common man is bright and clear;\nI alone seem dim.\n\nThe common man is sharp and discerning,\nI alone am dull and obscured.\nHow could I adorn externals while neglecting the root,\nAnd make schemes my business,\nBoasting to teach thieves?\n\n**Chapter 54: The Unshaken Foundation**\nOne who builds well does not uproot,\nOne who embraces well does not loosen.\nTheir descendants’ sacrifices never cease.\n\nDoes the world truly have those who build yet do not uproot,\nOr embrace yet do not loosen?\nOnly the Sage knows the true nature of *xing* (性),\nDiscerns the falsehood of things,\nDiminishes things to cultivate the self—\nThus their virtue accumulates and fills.\n\nThough they establish nothing in reality,\nTheir foundation is unshakable;\nThough they grasp nothing in reality,\nTheir embrace is unbreakable.\nThus even to their descendants,\nSacrifices never cease.\n\nCultivate the self, and virtue becomes true;\nCultivate the family, and virtue overflows;\nCultivate the village, and virtue endures;\nCultivate the state, and virtue abounds;\nCultivate the world, and virtue is universal.\nOnce the self is clearly cultivated,\nExtend its principle outward—\nEven to governing the world is possible.\n\nThus observe the self with the self,\nObserve the family with the family,\nObserve the village with the village,\nObserve the state with the state,\nObserve the world with the world.\nHow do I know the world is thus?\nBy this.\n\nBeyond heaven and earth lies what the world cannot see,\nYet its principle can be inferred and known.\nWhen self-cultivation reaches its peak,\nObserving the self with the self,\nObserving the family with the family,\nObserving the village with the village,\nObserving the state with the state—\nAll are within my grasp.\nYet how do I know the Sage observes the world with the world,\nNot as I observe the self with the self?\nCan the self not be observed by the self,\nWhile the world cannot be observed by the self?\nThus it is said: *How do I know the world is thus? By this.*\nFor it is known through the self alone.\n\n**Lu’s Commentary:**\nOne who builds well grounds the state in the Dao,\nThus its roots run deep and its foundation is unshakable;\nOne who embraces well enfolds the people with virtue,\nThus no bonds can sever them.\nTheir descendants enjoy long prosperity,\nSacrifices never cease.\n\nBelow, from *\"Cultivate the self\"* onward,\nThe progression is vast—\nFrom observing the self to the world,\nA constant truth,\nKnown without stepping outside.\n\n**Chapter 55: The Depth of Contained Virtue**\nThe depth of contained virtue\nIs like that of an infant.\n\nWhen Laozi spoke of Dao and virtue,\nHe often likened them to an infant,\nFor he spoke only of their essence,\nNot yet their function.\n\nNow, an infant lies tranquil, untroubled—\nIts essence is complete.\nYet the infant does not know how to respond to things,\nSo it cannot be said to lack function.\n\nPoisonous creatures do not sting,\nFierce beasts do not attack,\nRaptors do not seize.\nThe Dao has no form—\nThings cannot even see it,\nHow could they harm it?\n\nWhat makes humans susceptible to harm\nIs their having a mind.\nOnly when there is a mind does form arise,\nOnly when form arises does an enemy arise,\nAnd only when an enemy arises does harm come.\n\nOne without a mind—\nThings and enemies—\nHow could they harm them?\n\nThe reason an infant reaches this state\nIs solely because it has no mind.\n\nIts bones are weak, its sinews soft, yet its grip is firm;\nIt does not yet know the union of male and female, yet it moves—\nThe essence is complete.\nWithout grasping, yet it holds;\nWithout desire, yet it acts—\nThus it is known that its essence is abundant,\nNot its mind.\n\nIt cries all day yet its voice does not grow hoarse—\nHarmony is complete.\nWhen the mind moves, the *qi* is injured,\nAnd when *qi* is injured, the cry becomes strained.\nYet it cries all day without strain—\nThus it is known that its mind does not move\nAnd its *qi* is harmonious.\n\nKnowing harmony is *cháng* (常),\nHarmony is not being harmed from without.\nReturning to one’s true nature is *cháng*,\nMeeting things and knowing their origin is *cháng*.\nKnowing harmony is *cháng*,\nObtaining the origin and responding to all things is *cháng*.\nThey are one and the same Dao,\nThus all are called *cháng*.\n\nKnowing *cháng* is enlightenment,\nExcessive life is *xiáng* (祥).\nLife cannot be artificially prolonged,\nYet if one tries to prolong it,\nIt is not the true way.\n*Xiáng* is *yāo* (妖).\n\nForcing *qi* with the mind is coercion.\nIf *qi* naturally resists disorder\nYet the mind forces it further,\nCoercion becomes extreme.\nWhen things reach their peak, they decline—\nThis is called *not* the Dao,\nAnd the Dao declines early.\nForcing life makes *qi* unable to follow its natural course,\nDay by day it enters rigidity and coercion,\nAnd aging follows—\nThus the infant’s true nature is lost.\n\n**Chapter 56: The Wise Do Not Speak**\nThe wise do not speak,\nFor speech reveals ignorance.\n\n**Chapter 56: The Wise Do Not Speak (continued)**\n\n「塞其兑，閉其門，挫其鋭，解其忿，和其光，同其塵，是謂玄同。\nThe Daoist seals his *fuè* (口),\nCloses his gates,\nDulls his sharpness,\nDissolves his anger,\nBlends his radiance,\nMingles with the dust—\nThis is called *Xuántóng* (玄同).\n\nThe Dao is not spoken of,\nYet it is not separate from speech,\nBut those who know may not speak,\nAnd those who speak may not know.\nOnly by sealing *fuè* and closing gates,\nDulling sharpness and dissolving anger,\nBlending radiance and mingling with dust,\nTo govern one’s inner self—\nIn silence, one aligns with the Dao.\nThus it is said:\n\n*\"The wise do not speak,\nYet speak without speaking,\nTruly forgetting speech.\"*\n\nOne who speaks without knowing,\nWhose words fail to strike the mark,\nHow much more so in matters of debate?\nTo embody the Dao and transcend all attachments,\nTo lose the traces of *Xuántóng*—\nThis is *Xuántóng*.\n\nMaster Sima says:\nThe Dao abhors fierce blades and sharp edges,\nIt despises laborious deeds,\nIt shuns dazzling brilliance,\nIt values humility and dishonor—\nThus the Dao cannot be grasped as near or distant,\nBeneficial or harmful,\nHonored or degraded.\nHence, it is most honored by all under heaven.\n\nIf it can be grasped as near, it can be grasped as distant;\nIf it can be grasped as beneficial, it can be grasped as harmful;\nIf it can be grasped as honored, it can be grasped as degraded.\nThe Daoist, embodying the Dao,\nCovers all things equally—\nWho then is near or distant?\nViews all with equal measure—\nWho then is beneficial or harmful?\nKnows neither glory nor shame—\nWho then is honored or degraded?\nBeyond the reach of schemes and calculations,\nThis is why the Dao is most honored by all under heaven.\n\n**Chapter 57: Governing with the Dao**\n\nGoverning with *zhèng* (正) is the Dao,\nEmploying *qí* (奇) in warfare is the Dao,\nAcquiring the world without action is the Dao.\n\nThe ancient sages were gentle yet far-reaching,\nPowerful yet close at hand.\nThey had no will to wage war,\nOnly when unavoidable did they engage in campaigns.\nThus, governing the realm is *zhèng* (正),\nEmploying force is *qí* (奇).\n\nYet even this is insufficient to claim the world.\nThe world is a sacred instrument of the Dao,\nUnto be wrought.\nThose who act upon it fail,\nThose who grasp it lose it.\nOnly the Daoist, embodying the Dao,\nIs effortlessly without action—\nThough insufficient to claim the world,\nYet the world returns to him.\n\nHow do I know this to be true?\nBy this.»\n\n**Chapter 58: The Dao of Governance and Its Hidden Workings**\n\nWhen the world abounds in taboos, the people grow ever poorer.\nWhen the ruler multiplies taboos, the common voice cannot reach above—\nthen the people are impoverished and without recourse.\n\nWhen the people abound in clever devices, the state grows ever more deluded.\nClever devices are stratagems and schemes.\nA wise ruler above must always keep the people in ignorance and without desire.\nWhen the people abound in stratagems, their superiors are dazzled and deluded.\n\nWhen the people abound in clever arts, strange things proliferate.\nWhen the people neglect their roots and pursue superficial skills,\nthen useless and extraordinary things arise.\n\nWhen laws and decrees proliferate, thieves and robbers multiply.\nDistrusting the people’s deceit, one multiplies laws to overcome them—\nyet when the people have no place to turn, theft and robbery only increase.\n\nThus the sage says:\n*I act without action, yet the people transform themselves;\nI love stillness, yet the people align themselves;\nI remain without concern, yet the people grow rich;\nI have no desires, yet the people return to simplicity.*\n\n**Governance in Obscurity**\nWhen governance is obscure, the people are pure;\nWhen governance is scrutinizing, the people grow cunning.\nCalamity and fortune lean upon each other,\nFortune and calamity lie hidden within.\nWho knows their ultimate end?\nPerhaps there is no fixed standard.\n\nThe upright becomes the strange,\nThe good becomes the ominous.\nThe people are deeply confused—\nand this state has endured for long.\n\n**The Grandeur of Heaven and Earth and the Common Perception**\n\nThe vastness of Heaven and Earth,\nThe common view of the world—\nThere are things they **overlook** (*yǒu suǒ míng*¹) yet fail to comprehend.\n\nFor fortune leans upon calamity,\nAnd calamity lies hidden within fortune,\nLike the cycles of day and night, of cold and heat, passing one another.\n\nThe upright becomes the strange,\nThe good becomes the ominous,\nLike the stages of infancy and old age, of life and death, following in turn.\n\nThere was never an absolute upright,\nYet those who are confused fail to recognize it.\n\nOnly the sage emerges beyond all things,\nSurveying their beginning and end,\nGrasping their perfect whole yet discarding their petty scrutiny,\nSeeming obscure as if nothing were clear—\nAnd thus the people are pure, each fulfilling their true nature.\n\nBut common folk do not grasp the fullness of the Dao,\nTaking what their ears and eyes perceive as ultimate.\nThey think themselves fortunate,\nYet fail to see the calamity lurking behind;\nThey believe themselves good,\nYet fail to recognize the ominous arising within.\nTheir trivial observations, they call them clarity—\nYet excessive scrutiny only harms, and they do not awaken to its folly.\nIs this not lamentable?\n\nThus the sage is square yet does not cut,\nHonest yet does not carve,\nStraight yet does not overreach,\nBright yet does not dazzle.\n\nKnowing that petty scrutiny cannot exhaust the fullness of things,\nThough he may possess the ability to be square, honest, straight, or bright,\nHe does not employ these abilities,\nFor fear of falling into one-sidedness and not returning to balance—\nThis is what the common world calls *obscurity* (*mènmèn*).\n\n**Harmonious Governance** says:\nSquare yet cutting breeds rigidity in argument;\nHonest yet carving invites arrogance in self-purification;\nStraight yet overreaching gives rise to the attitude of domineering;\nBright yet dazzling brings the peril of self-aggrandizement.\n\nOnly the sage knows these abilities yet does not use them.\n**The Collected Commentaries of the *Zhen* Dao/Way Classic** concludes, Volume Three.  #1 *Opening*: Originally \"hear\" (*wén*), corrected according to the *Xiao Wan* edition.\n**The Collected Commentaries of the *Zhen* Dao/Way Classic**, Volume Four, *Commentaries by the Scholar Zhao*.\n\n**Chapter 59: *Harmonious Governance and Serving Heaven***\n\nTo govern people and serve Heaven,\nNothing surpasses *frugality* (*shè*).\nFor only through *frugality*\nDoes one attain *early service*—\n*Early service* is called *accumulating virtue/power* in depth.\nTo accumulate virtue/power deeply\nIs to achieve what cannot be overcome;\nWhat cannot be overcome\nIs to know no limits—\nAnd knowing no limits,\nOne can establish a state.\nThe foundation of establishing a state,\nThis is what endures long.\n\nAll things:\nSquare yet they are cut,\nHonest yet they are pierced, #1\nStraight yet they overreach,\nBright yet they dazzle.\nYet the sage is square yet does not cut,\nHonest yet does not pierce,\nStraight yet does not overreach,\nBright yet does not dazzle—\nThis is what is called *frugality*.\nFor *frugality* means\nHaving yet not employing.\n\nThe world’s affliction lies in its inability to subdue others,\nYet if one truly possesses *frugality* and practices it,\nThough never competing with others,\nOthers recognize they cannot overcome you—\nThen your subjugation comes early.\nOnce others are subdued,\nYou gather and conceal your strength,\nUntil even when your life ends,\nYou never reveal your full capacity—\nThen virtue/power is deeply accumulated.\nWhen virtue/power is thickly accumulated,\nEven the world’s strongest cannot overcome you—\nThen none can fathom or measure you.\nOnly then can you establish a state.\n\nYet the petty men of the world,\nWith even a handspan of power,\nUse it lightly—\nOnce they test and fail to subdue,\nThe world measures their depth and contests them,\nThough they wish to preserve their state,\nThey cannot.\n\nThus I know that *frugality* can establish a state—\nThis is the foundation of establishing a state.\nThis is called *deep-rooted and firm-belted*,\nThe Dao/Way of *long life and enduring vision*.\n\nMencius said:\nTo exhaust one’s heart,\nTo nurture one’s nature—\nThis is how one serves Heaven.\n\nTo govern people with *frugality*\nIs how one can establish a state.\nTo serve Heaven with *frugality*\nIs how one attains deep-rooted firmness.\n\nThe ancient sages preserved their nature and life’s constancy,\nNot wasting externally or internally—\nThen their roots are deep and cannot be uprooted,\nTheir stems are firm and cannot be torn away—\nThus even *long life and enduring vision* are attainable.\n\nThough governing people and serving Heaven\nMay differ in internal and external,\nYet their harmony is one.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 60: *Governing Great States***\n\nTo govern a great state,\nAs one poaches a small fish.\nPoaching a small fish,\nOne must not disturb it—\nGoverning a great state,\nOne must not weary the people.\nTo weary them is to exhaust them;\nTo disturb them is to ruin the fish.\nTo rule the world with the Dao/Way,\nIts spirits are not numinous.\n\nThe sage acts without action,\nLetting people follow their natural course—\nExternally seeking nothing,\nInternally fearing nothing—\nThen none can invade them,\nEven the spirits have no power to harm.\n\n**Lu’s Commentary:**\nWhen the sage rules the world with the Dao/Way,\nThe harmony of Heaven and Earth responds—\nCold and heat alternate,\nLife and transformation unfold—\nAt such times, the spirits have no mystic response—\nWhat numinous power could there be?\nIt is not that the spirits are not numinous,\nBut their numinousness does not harm.\nIt is not that their numinousness does not harm,\nNor does the sage harm.\nIt is not that the spirits’ numinousness does not harm,\nBut the sage never harms—\nThus the spirits have no power to act.\n\n**Ye’s Commentary:**\nThe sage does not harm—\nExamining the following passage on *virtue’s reciprocal return*,\nIt is people who become numinous.\nFor when neither harms the other,\nVirtue reciprocally returns.\nThat people and spirits do not harm each other\nIs because there is a sage above—\nThus virtue reciprocally returns.\nPeople return virtue to the spirits,\nAnd also return virtue to the sage.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 61: *Great States as the World’s Flow***\n\nGreat states are the world’s flow—\nThe world’s convergence upon great states,\nLike waters rushing to the lowlands.\nThe world’s exchange,\nThe world’s *yin*—\n*Yin* always overcomes *yang* through stillness,\nAnd stillness is the lowly.\nAll movement rushes to stillness,\nJust as all heights rush to the lowlands.\nThus great states, by descending to small states,\nTake them;\nSmall states, by descending to great states,\nAre taken by them.\nGreat states, by descending, take others;\nSmall states, by descending, are taken by others.\nSpeaking of the great descending,\nIt seems they should not descend to take others—\nYet they do.\nSpeaking of the small descending,\nThey cannot but descend to be taken by others.\nGreat states seek only to nurture others;\nSmall states seek only to serve others—\nBoth attain what they desire,\nThus the great should descend.\n\n**Harmonious Governance Commentary:**\nHeaven’s Dao descends to nourish and shines brightly,\nThus nothing is left uncovered;\nEarth’s Dao is low yet ascends,\nThus it can support Heaven.\nHumans follow Earth,\nEarth follows Heaven—\nThus the great should descend.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 62: *The Dao/Way as the Essence of All Things***\n\nThe Dao/Way is the essence of all things,\nA treasure of the virtuous,\nA refuge of the unvirtuous.\nBeautiful speech can be traded,\nNoble conduct can elevate others.\nWhat is the harm in a person’s flaws?\nAll that appears externally\nAre but their thresholds and halls.\nThe Dao/Way in things\nIs like their essence—\nAll things possess it,\nYet none see it.\n\nOnly the worthy attain and hold it,\nThus it is called the treasure of the virtuous.\nThe foolish, though unable to possess it,\nYet without the Dao/Way they cannot rest—\nThus it is called the refuge of the unvirtuous.\nThe Dao/Way does not distance itself from people,\nYet people distance themselves from it.\nIf one truly speaks beautifully,\nIt can be traded in the world;\nIf one practices noble conduct,\nIt can elevate others.\nThough in the morning one acts unjustly,\nAnd in the evening hears the Dao/Way,\nExhausting all falsehoods,\nOne’s nature returns—\nEven if one seeks to point out their flaws,\nThey cannot be found—\nAnd how could they be abandoned?\n\nThus establishing a sovereign,\nAppointing the Three Ministers,\nEven with a jade tablet and four horses ahead,\nIt is not as good as sitting and presenting this Dao/Way.\nEstablishing a sovereign,\nAppointing the Three Ministers,\nIs to save people with this Dao/Way.\nThough jade tablets are precious,\nAnd four horses are fine,\nPresenting them is not as beneficial\nAs sitting and presenting this Dao/Way.\n\nThe ancient reason why this Dao/Way was held in high esteem was not because it could be sought to obtain, or used to escape blame? Therefore, it is held in high esteem by all under Heaven.\n\nThe Dao/Way originates within oneself; people’s misfortune lies in not seeking it. If one seeks, one will obtain it. The Dao/Way has no merit or guilt; people’s misfortune lies in not knowing it. If one knows it, one will have no guilt and cannot be stained by it.\n\n**Chapter 63: The Chapter on Non-Action**\nTo act without acting,\nTo manage without managing,\nTo savor without savoring—\nGreat or small, much or little,\nRepaying grudges with virtue.\n\nThe Sage acts without acting, yet nothing is left undone;\nManages without managing, yet nothing is left unattended;\nSavors without savoring, yet nothing is left unsavored.\nToward greatness or smallness, muchness or littleness,\nOne simply meets them all with the Dao/Way.\n\nWhat people never forget is resentment.\nYet when their love and hatred fade,\nEven repaying resentment is done with virtue—\nThen one knows how to apply virtue without restraint.\n\nDifficult things must be addressed when they are easy;\nGreat things must be undertaken when they are small.\nThe most difficult tasks under Heaven\nMust begin when they are easy;\nThe greatest undertakings under Heaven\nMust begin when they are small.\nThus the Sage never strives for greatness,\nAnd so achieves true greatness.\n\nLight promises lead to few fulfilled words,\nMany easy things lead to many difficulties.\nThus the Sage treats even the difficult with caution,\nAnd so remains free of difficulty.\n\nPeople fear the great and scorn the small,\nDread the many and seek the few.\nWhen they wait until things are difficult before acting,\nOr until things are great before undertaking them,\nTheir affairs are doomed to fail.\n\nThe Sage equalizes great and small,\nUnifies much and little,\nHolds nothing in fear,\nSees nothing as difficult—\nAnd how could their affairs fail?\n\n**Chapter 64: The Chapter on Ease in Holding**\nWhat is settled and easy to hold,\nBefore its signs appear, is easy to plan;\nWhat is fragile is easy to break,\nWhat is subtle is easy to disperse.\nAct before it exists,\nOrder before it is disordered.\nWhen it has not yet arisen,\nHold and plan for it—\nThat is sufficient.\nWhen it is about to manifest,\nOnly by dispersing it before it forms can it be removed—\nYet even then, it is better than when already formed.\n\nThus, acting before it exists is supreme;\nOrdering before it is disordered is secondary.\n\nA tree as thick as one’s embrace\nGrows from a tiny sprout;\nA nine-tiered tower\nRises from a single clod of earth;\nA thousand-li journey\nBegins with a single step.\n\nThe doer brings about failure,\nThe grasper loses hold.\nThus the Sage, with no action, knows no failure;\nWith no grasping, knows no loss.\n\nThe coming of chaos and blessing,\nAll arise from these three things accumulating the small to form the great.\nThe Sage awaits them with non-action,\nGuards them with non-grasping,\nThus allowing blessing to arise spontaneously,\nAnd calamity to vanish on its own.\n\nIt is like planting seeds—\nDeeply plowed and sown thickly,\nBy autumn, the harvest comes naturally.\nIt is like being robbed—\nSitting calmly and observing attentively,\nThe thief will retreat on his own.\n\nPeople do not understand the natural workings of things,\nBelieving nothing is accomplished without doing,\nNothing retained without grasping—\nThus they constantly contend with calamity,\nAnd obstruct the growth of blessing,\nSo that when calamity arrives, it cannot be averted,\nAnd when blessing comes, it cannot be completed—\nSuch is their inherent nature.\n\nThe people’s undertakings\nOften fail just as they near completion.\nIf one is as careful at the end as at the beginning,\nThere will be no failure.\n\nThe Sage knows the harm of artificial action,\nDoes not aid Heaven with human effort,\nFrom beginning to end follows what is natural—\nThus nothing remains unaccomplished.\n\nPeople’s minds dwell on gain and loss,\nYet in the minutiae of all things,\nThere are still those who do not interfere\nAnd let nature take its course.\nWhen they see things nearly complete\nAnd then recklessly disrupt them,\nThere is none who does not bring about their own ruin.\nThus it is said:\n*Be as careful at the end as at the beginning,*\nAnd there will be no failure.\n\nThus the Sage desires without desiring,\nDoes not prize difficult-to-obtain goods;\nLearns without learning,\nReturns to what others have already surpassed.\nTo assist the natural unfolding of all things,\nYet does not dare to act.\n\nPeople all follow their desires to harm things,\nTrust their learning to harm principle.\nThe Sage is not without desire—\nDesiring yet not desiring,\nThus though desiring, they do not harm things.\nNot without learning—\nLearning yet not learning,\nThus though learning, they do not harm principle.\nOnly then are they internally and externally clear and bright,\nVast and without action,\nAble to assist the natural unfolding of all things,\nAnd await their spontaneous completion.\n\n**Chapter 65: The Chapter on Ancient Skill in the Dao/Way**\nThose anciently skilled in the Dao/Way\nDid not enlighten the people,\nBut sought to make them simple.\nThe so-called wise of antiquity\nKnew the complete Dao/Way,\nAnd surveyed the beginning and end of all things—\nThus they were worthy of esteem.\n\nCommon people cannot comprehend this,\nAnd drown in petty wisdom,\nTaking discernment for clarity—\nThus the harm of wisdom is great.\n\nTherefore the Sage governs the people with the Dao/Way,\nNot to enlighten them,\nBut to make them simple.\nIf they are without knowledge and without desire,\nAnd follow what their superiors do,\nEven if there are errors, they will be minor.\n\nThe difficulty in governing the people\nLies in their excessive wisdom.\nThus governing with wisdom is the ruin of the state;\nIf I govern with wisdom, the people will counter with their own wisdom,\nAnd the ruler and subjects will mutually destroy each other.\n\nNot governing with wisdom is the state’s blessing.\nKnowing these two principles is called *Mysterious Virtue*.\nMysterious Virtue is profound,\nFar-reaching,\nContrary to the ways of things—\nOnly then does one attain the Great Harmony.\n\nWhat I value is *virtue*.\nWhat things value is *wisdom*.\nVirtue and wisdom are inherently opposed,\nYet what wisdom follows is small,\nWhile what virtue follows is great.\n\nYe said:\n*Governing with wisdom is the ruin of the state;*\n*Not governing with wisdom is the state’s blessing.*\nYet this is only a standard,\nNot the Dao/Way itself—\nThus it is called *Mysterious Virtue*.\nAccumulating Mysterious Virtue to its deepest and farthest extent,\nOne approaches the root,\nAnd turns against the ways of things—\nOnly then do all things settle into their natural states,\nThus it is called the Great Harmony.\n\n**Chapter 66: The Chapter on the King of All Valleys**\nThe reason the river and sea can be the king of all valleys\nIs that they excel in humility,\nThus they become the king of all valleys.\n\nThus the Sage desires to be above others,\nYet speaks in humility;\nDesires to go before others,\nYet places himself behind.\n\nThe Sage does not truly desire to be above others,\nNor to go before others.\nFor when one is humble and yields,\nThe Way itself compels one to rise and lead.\n\nThus the Sage, though in high station, is not resented,\nThough in the forefront, is not harmed.\nTherefore all under Heaven willingly follow without tiring.\n\nBecause he does not contend,\nNone under Heaven can contend with him.\n\n**Chapter 67: The Chapter on the Great Way**\nAll under Heaven say my Way is great,\nYet seems unskilled.\n\nOnly because it is great does it seem unskilled.\nIf it were truly skilled, it would be trifling indeed.\n\nThe Dao is vast and formless,\nDecayed and nameless,\nFilling all things yet resembling none—\nThis is why it is great.\n\nIf it resembled things, it would be but one thing—\nHow could it be great?\n\nI possess three treasures; guard and hold them:\nFirst, *compassion*;\nSecond, *frugality*;\nThird, *not daring to act first under Heaven.*\n\nThe Way is great because it does not resemble things,\nThus when it manifests as *virtue/power*,\nIt is subtle and blunt as a sharp edge,\nRetreats as it advances,\nAnd does not conform to worldly conventions.\n\nNow, the worldly value boldness,\nPraise vastness,\nBoast swiftness and sharpness—\nYet what I treasure are:\nCompassion and forbearance,\nFrugality and restraint,\nModesty and retreat—\nThese three are what the world calls unskilled.\n\nCompassion makes one courageous—\nThe world deems decisive boldness virtuous,\nYet calls compassion forbearance as inferior,\nNot knowing that decisive boldness is easily thwarted,\nWhile compassion and forbearance are invincible,\nAnd in the end, will surely become courage.\n\nFrugality makes one vast—\nThe world praises vastness that covers all,\nYet calls frugality meager,\nNot knowing that vastness is easily exhausted,\nWhile restraint is easily satisfied,\nAnd in the end, will surely become vast.\n\nNot daring to act first under Heaven,\nThus one becomes a vessel and leader.\nThe world deems swiftness and sharpness as ability,\nYet shames not daring to lead,\nNot knowing that swiftness and sharpness often harm others,\nWhile not daring to lead brings joy to the world,\nAnd in the end, will surely become a vessel and leader.\n\nFor from simplicity arises utility—\nThe Sage employs it to become an official and leader.\nFrom simplicity to utility,\nOnly then does one have those who follow as leader.\n\nNow, if one abandons compassion and courage,\nAbandons frugality and vastness,\nAbandons retreat and precedence,\nOne is as good as dead.\n\nBoldness, vastness, and precedence—\nThese are what all people detest.\nTo be detested by all,\nIs to be near death.\n\nCompassion, when wielded in war, brings victory;\nWhen held in defense, brings security.\nWhen Heaven intends to save a person,\nIt shields them with compassion.\nTo govern with compassion,\nThings love them as their own parents,\nEven willing to die for them without hesitation—\nThus one can wage war,\nThus one can defend.\n\nWhen Heaven intends to save this person,\nIt opens their heart-mind,\nMaking them boundless in compassion,\nThen all will defend them.\n\nZhao said:\nThe Way of Laozi is great—\nThe heart is perplexed and cannot know it,\nThe mouth is agape and cannot speak of it—\nHow could the worldly know it?\n\nI have merely taken these three to instruct the world—\nWithin one passage, seven or eight out of ten are here.\n\nFive chapters warn against war,\nOne chapter warns against arrogance,\nThree chapters warn against extravagance and advocate frugality,\nFifteen chapters speak of gentleness, weakness, and non-contention.\n\nAgain, within these,\nCompassion is paramount—\nWhen Heaven intends to save this person,\nIt entrusts them with compassion—\nThis is called Heaven guiding their sincerity.\n\nWhen Heaven intends to abandon this person,\nIt entrusts them with evil—\nThis is called Heaven seizing their vitality.\n\n**Chapter 68: The Chapter on the Virtuous Warrior**\nThe virtuous warrior is not violent—\nThe warrior must take martial prowess as foundation,\nYet if he acts with cowardice,\nIf he wields martial prowess with violence, he will die.\n\nThe skilled fighter does not rage—\nThe Sage fights only when compelled,\nIf born of anger,\nThen killing for my sake,\nHeaven will surely punish it.\n\nThe skilled victor does not contend—\nBecause I do not contend,\nI can overcome their clamor.\nIf born of contention,\nI may not necessarily win.\n\nThe skilled user of people places himself below them—\nAll people have a desire to excel,\nThus none can truly serve them.\nIf one truly places himself below them,\nThen all under Heaven will serve me.\n\nThis is called the *virtue/power* of non-contention,\nThis is called employing people’s strength,\nThis is called aligning with Heaven—\nThe ultimate principle of antiquity.\n\nZhao said:\nTo align with Heaven is the most vital principle of antiquity.\n\n**Chapter 69: The Chapter on the Words of War**\nThe words of war say:\n\nThe Master Lao lamented the world’s use of arms,\nTaking slaughter as the foundation,\nThus he raised the ancient records of warfare\nTo clarify the necessity of compelled campaigning.\n\nI dare not be the aggressor,\nBut only the responder.\nI do not advance an inch,\nYet retreat a foot.\n\nThe one who advances\nIs he who has intent to contend.\nThe one who retreats\nIs he who has no intent to contend.\n\nThis is called *action without action*,\nWithout intent to contend,\nEven if arms are used or not,\nThe outcome remains the same. #4\n\nNot contending with others,\nIs akin to *action without action*.\nTo repel without force,\nYet still have no adversary,\nTo grasp without arms.\n\nIf there is no intent to contend,\nThen even amid military campaigns,\nThere is no force to repel,\nNo adversary to confront,\nNo arms to wield—\nHow could there be blame for using arms?\n\nZhao said:\nThe law of the Great Marshal states:\nWhen punishing, announce the crime with drums and bells,\nAnd halt at the border.\nIf the enemy submits,\nThen the matter is resolved—\nNo need to advance further.\n\nThus, advancing by an inch\nIs often met with few gains,\nWhile retreating by a foot\nIs often met with many gains.\n\nThis, though it appears as *action*,\nIs truly *action without action*; #5\nThough it seems to repel,\nThere is no force to repel;\nThough it appears to confront an enemy,\nThere is no adversary to rely upon;\nThough it seems to wield arms,\nThere are no arms to hold.\n\nNo calamity is greater than underestimating the enemy,\nFor underestimating the enemy\nLeads to reckless warfare,\nAnd reckless warfare\nLeads to careless killing—\nThus losing the basis of compassion.\n\nTherefore, when opposing armies clash,\nThe compassionate shall prevail.\nWhen two enemies confront and I am compelled to act,\nThen I possess compassion.\nWhen compassion is evident,\nHeaven and humanity aid me—\nEven if I wish not to prevail,\nIt cannot be avoided.\n\nI speak of things most easy to know—**Chapter 70: The Chapter on Easy Knowing**\nI speak of things most easy to know,\nMost easy to practice.\nYet none under Heaven can know them,\nNone can practice them.\n\nThe Dao is vast,\nYet sufficient to restore one’s nature—\nAnd the subtlety of nature\nIs seen in one’s daily actions,\nIn eating, drinking, and repose.\n\nThe Sage points to this\nAnd shows it to the people—\nIs it not easy to know?\n\nIf one embodies this\nTo respond to the world—\nIs it not easy to practice?\n\nYet the world’s common affliction\nIs that they use it without knowing,\nAnd even knowing,\nThey cannot practice it—\nMuch less can they embody it!\n\nWords have a *principle*,\nAffairs have a *master*.\nOnly the unknowing\nIs why none know me.\n\nWords are the *Dao’s* snare,\nAffairs are the *Dao’s* traces.\nIf the *Dao* could be fully expressed in words,\nThen listening to words would suffice;\nIf it could be fully seen in affairs,\nThen examining affairs would suffice.\n\nYet words cannot exhaust it,\nAffairs cannot reveal it—\nOnly by abandoning words to seek their *principle*,\nAnd discarding affairs to seek their *master*,\nCan one attain them.\n\nTruly, the ancient Sages\nHad no scheming, no doing,\nYet there remained a *spontaneous* and unselfconscious presence—\nThis lies beyond the reach of thought and calculation,\nThus none ever truly know me.\n\nFew know me,\nThus those who follow me are precious.\nWhat the common people can know\nIs not worthy of esteem.\n\nTherefore, the Sage wears coarse robes while cherishing jade.\nThe Sage outwardly appears the same as others,\nYet inwardly remains distinct.\n\nZhao said:\nThis chapter sets the stage for the next,\nOn knowing and not knowing.\n\nThe unknowing is not like the unknowing of wood or stone.\nThe *Dao* cannot be grasped by mere knowledge,\nNor extinguished by sensory perception,\nNor measured by emotional judgment.\n\nThe *Dao* is not obscure or void,\nYet it enters through obscurity and voidness—\nThis is not something the world can comprehend.\n\nThough the world does not know it,\nOnly those who embody the *Dao*\nAppear outwardly hidden yet inwardly steadfast—\nIs this not also precious?\n\n**Chapter 71: The Chapter on Knowing Not Knowing**\nHigher than knowing is not knowing,\nLower than not knowing is knowing as a disease.\n\nThe *Dao* lies beyond thought and calculation,\nThus it cannot be known.\n\nYet before one knows it,\nThere is no way to enter without knowing;\nAnd once one knows it and clings to that knowing,\nThen it becomes a disease.\n\nThus, knowing while not knowing above—\nNot knowing while knowing as a disease.\n\nGuang said:\nThe *Dao* does not belong to knowing,\nNor does it belong to not knowing.\nKnowing is false perception,\nNot knowing is without strategy—\nYet when one understands the *Dao* and acts as if he does not know,\nThen he preserves the truth of the *Dao* forever,\nAnd this knowing is indeed praiseworthy.\n\nBefore one’s understanding of the *Dao*,\nHe stands in non-knowing;\nWhen he probes and forces knowing,\nThen he falls ill.\nLu said:\nThe nature of the *Dao*\nIs one who does not know yet can know.\n\nTo know that one does not know,\nAnd yet to know it with not knowing—\nThis is the ultimate knowing.\nThough one knows that he does not know,\nYet he knows it with knowing—\nHis mind is then ordinary, and how could it not fall ill? #6\n\nOnly by recognizing knowing as a disease,\nIs one free from disease.\nSince one cannot remain in not knowing,\nNor can one remain in knowing,\nOnly by recognizing knowing as a disease,\nWill the disease itself dissolve over time.\n\nThe Sage is not afflicted,\nBecause he recognizes knowing as a disease,\nThus he is not afflicted.\n\nZhao said:\nThe *Lengyan* Sutra states:\n*\"Knowing without seeing is knowing not knowing—this is the highest.*\n*Knowing without establishing knowing is not knowing while knowing—this is the disease.\"*\n\nThus, to know that which cannot be known\nAnd yet to cling to knowing—\nThis is the disease.\nOnly by recognizing the knowable as a disease,\nWill the disease itself vanish over time.\n\nThe Sage originally has no false knowing as a disease,\nFor he recognizes the common people’s disease—\nHe establishes knowing to remove the disease of knowing,\nThus though he establishes knowing,\nHe is not afflicted by it.\n\nLu said:\nOnly by recognizing knowing as a disease\nAnd treating it as such,\nDoes one return to non-knowing,\nAnd knowing is no longer sufficient to afflict one.\n\nTherefore it is said:\nOnly by recognizing knowing as a disease,\nIs one free from disease.\n\nNanbo Ziqí said:\nI grieve for those who destroy themselves,\nI grieve for those who grieve for others,\nI grieve for those who grieve for those who grieve—\nTheir sorrow grows ever more distant.\n\nIf Ziqí speaks once,\nIt is to say: *\"Recognize knowing as a disease.\"* #7\n\n**Chapter 72: The Chapter on the People Not Fearing Authority**\nIf the people do not fear authority,\nThen the greatest fear will arrive.\n\nTruly, nature itself has authority—\nHigh and bright, vast and luminous,\nRadiant beyond measure,\nNone can surpass it—\nThis is called the *greatest

73: The Chapter on the Dao of Boldness and Caution**\nBoldness in daring leads to death,\nBoldness in not daring leads to life.\nHe who knows these two,\nSome benefit, some harm—\nWhat the Dao abhors,\nWho can know its reason?\n\nThus, even the Sage finds it difficult.\n\nBoldness in daring means death,\nBoldness in not daring means life—\nThis is the great constant of nature.\n\nYet those who dare may sometimes gain life,\nThose who do not dare may sometimes meet death—\nThe world recklessly hopes for chance outcomes,\nAnd resents the constant laws of nature.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven is vast and distant—\nIts likes and dislikes have no fixed origin.\nWho can truly know them?\n\n#8\n\n**Chapter 74: The Chapter on the People Not Fearing Death**\nThe people do not commonly fear death—\nWhy then must we frighten them with death?\n\nWhen governance is perverse and punishments are excessive,\nThe people have no recourse—\nThen they do not commonly fear death.\n\nEven if we frighten them with death,\nIt will be of no use.\n\nIf we make the people fear death as a rare occurrence,\nI seize and execute those who act deceitfully—\nWho would dare?\n\nThe people rest secure in governance,\nCommonly cherishing life yet fearing death—\nThen I seize and execute those who deceive and disrupt the order,\nWho would not submit?\n\n開元曰：For those who act deceitfully, even if I seize them by force and execute,\nWho would dare to do so immediately?\nIt is because the Heavenly law does not fail in its execution.\n\n常有司殺者殺。\nThe one who executes is Heaven.\nIn the midst of the world’s governance,\nThose who employ deceitful tactics and disrupt the order,\nAct freely among us—\nThen they are abandoned by Heaven.\n\nHeaven abandons them, yet I execute them—\nThen it is Heaven who executes, not I.\n\nTo replace the one who executes and carry out the execution,\nIs to replace the great artisan and wield the axe.\nTo replace the great artisan and wield the axe,\nFew would not harm their own hands.\n\nTo execute those whom Heaven has not abandoned,\nIs to replace the one who executes.\n\nTo replace the great artisan and wield the axe,\nMeans harming one’s own hands—\nTo replace the one who executes,\nMeans harming one’s own body.\n\n趙曰：How well did Chu灵王 speak:\n*\"I have killed many sons of men—\nHow could I avoid killing one of them?\"*\n\nWith Heaven’s Dao favoring reciprocity,\nThis is a warning to those who delight in killing others.\n\nQin’s cruelty tormented the world—\nThis is not worth mentioning—\nBut to execute Li Junxian under suspicion of resemblance,\nAnd to kill Wang Jingwen through jealousy and mistrust—\nThis is not the Dao of Heaven, is it?\n\nIf the Han and Tang sages,\nPlotted to exterminate the eunuchs and palace attendants,\nTheir crimes were indeed great—\nYet Heaven did not yet abandon its abhorrence,\nSo there was the calamity of replacing the great artisan and harming one’s own hands—\nHow much worse for those who freely indulge in slaughter and execution!」\n\nThe calamities will soon follow.\nYet evil cannot be indulged, nor fortune relied upon.\nIn the wars of Chu and Han, in the chaos of the Five Dynasties,\nthose they slaughtered and exterminated—nine out of every ten households—\nwere indeed slain by Heaven.\nHow can those who do evil escape fear?\n\n**Chapter 75: The People’s Hunger**\nThe people starve because their rulers exact too much in taxes.\nThe people are hard to govern because their rulers meddle too much.\nMen grow reckless with death because they cling too desperately to life.\nWhen rulers lead with their own schemes, the people respond in kind—\nthus, many affairs arise and governance becomes difficult.\nWhen rulers prioritize their own desires over the people,\nthe people compete to enrich their own lives—\nso even in death, they will not abandon their pursuit of gain.\n\nOnly those who do not make life their concern\nare wiser than those who revere it.\nTo revere life is to reach the utmost secrecy.\nOnly those who do not make life their concern\npreserve their lives naturally.\n\n*Avowal by Zhao:*\nThis chapter all speaks of how—\nonly those who do not seek to enrich life\ncan make death seem light.\nWhy then do they revere life?\n\n**Chapter 76: The People’s Birth and Death**\nWhen the people are born, they are soft and weak;\nwhen they die, they become firm and strong.\nGrass and trees, when born, are tender and brittle;\nwhen they die, they wither and decay.\nThus, the firm and strong belong to death,\nwhile the soft and weak belong to life.\nWhen *qi* flows freely within, the body knows no rigidity.\nWhen the ultimate principle prevails, affairs bear no burdensome strength.\n\nThus, armies that are strong do not conquer—\narmies conquer through righteousness, not through strength.\nStrength without righteousness meets swift defeat.\nTrees that are too strong split.\nFrom the moment they reach the thickness of a man’s arms, they must be felled.\nThe strong and great are beneath, the soft and weak are above.\nThis is the natural order of things:\nthe refined is above, the coarse is below.\nThe refined must be soft and weak, the coarse must be strong and great.\n\n**Chapter 77: The Dao of Heaven**\nHeaven’s Dao is like drawing a bow.\nWhen the bow is drawn, the upper sinews tighten;\nwhen released, the upper horn relaxes—\nthus, it illustrates Heaven’s raising of the high and lowering of the low.\nThe high are humbled, the low are elevated;\nthe excessive are diminished, the deficient are supplemented.\nHeaven’s Dao is to diminish the excessive and supplement the deficient.\nBut man’s Dao is not so:\nhe diminishes the deficient to serve the excessive.\nHeaven has no favorites, so it is impartial.\nMan is full of bias, so he is not impartial.\nWho, then, can have the excessive to bestow upon the world?\nOnly the sage.\n\nThe sage provides abundantly for all things without claiming credit,\nand though he gives, he becomes even more so.\nThough he shares, he becomes even more abundant—\nnone but the sage can endure this.\nThus, the sage acts without relying on it,\ncompletes his work without dwelling on it—\nis this not because he does not desire to be seen as virtuous?\nIf he acts and relies on it, if he completes his work and takes credit,\nthen virtue will be displayed in the world.\nWhen virtue is displayed in the world,\nit is because he has used the excessive to serve himself.\n\n**Chapter 78: The World’s Softness and Weakness**\nNothing in the world is as soft and weak as water,\nyet nothing can surpass it in overcoming the firm and strong—\nand nothing can replace it.\nThus, the soft overcomes the hard,\nthe weak overcomes the strong—\nyet the world knows this but cannot practice it.\n\nTherefore, the sage says:\n*\"To bear the filth of the state is to be called the guardian of the ancestral altars;\nto bear the misfortunes of the state is to be called the king of the world.\"*\nStraight speech seems paradoxical.\nStraight speech aligns with the Dao yet contradicts convention—\nfor convention holds that bearing filth is shameful,\nand bearing misfortunes is a calamity.\n\n**Chapter 79: Reconciling Great Grievances**\nTo reconcile great grievances will only breed further grievances—\nhow then can it be considered good?\nGrievances arise from delusion,\nand delusion stems from human nature.\nThose who understand human nature do not see delusion,\nand thus, what grievances remain?\nNow, if one does not remove the root yet seeks to reconcile the branches,\nthen though outwardly reconciled, inwardly the resentment lingers.\n\nThus, the sage holds the left contract\nwithout demanding accountability from others.\nTherefore, the virtuous oversee the contracts,\nwhile the unvirtuous oversee the settlements.\nThe left and right contracts exist\nto establish trust and resolve disputes.\n\nThe sage shares this human nature with all,\nyet people take delusion as normal,\nchasing after contention and plunder,\nunaware that their nature has never lacked delusion.\nThus, the sage reveals their true nature to them,\nurging them to eliminate delusion and restore their essence.\nWhen delusion is exhausted and essence is restored,\nthey will naturally attain clarity,\nas the right contract matches the left—\nwithout needing to be demanded, they will submit of their own accord.\n\nThen, even the greatest grievances\nwill dissolve like melting ice,\nknowing that the root was never truly there—\nand what need is there for rewards?\nThose without virtue, however,\nwish to impose this on everyone—\nyet their labor will be in vain.\n\n*Commentary by Pan:*\nThe left contract is taken from others,\nthe right contract is given to others.\nThe left contract is held by those who are held accountable—\nand that is all.\n\nHeaven’s Dao has no favorites,\nyet it always favors the virtuous.\nHeaven’s Dao is impartial,\nand only the virtuous receive its favor.\nThe contracts are also impartial—\nonly those who align with them obtain them.\n\n*Commentary by Ye:*\nIf someone comes to trouble me,\nI only need to hold fast to my integrity and await their response—\nI do not know if they will repay me.\nOnly then can I meet the world’s demands without labor,\njust as Heaven, without favoritism, bestows upon the virtuous alone.\n\n**Chapter 80: Small States, Few People**\nIn a small state with few people,\nLaozi was born in the declining Zhou,\nwhere culture flourished but customs decayed—\nhe wished to remedy this with *wuwei*.\nThus, at the end of his book, he expressed his aspiration:\nto find a small state with few people\nto test his teachings—though he knew it was unattainable.\n\nLet the people have ten or a hundred measures of grain,\nyet not use them.\nLet the people value death so deeply\nthat they do not flee far.\nLet the people each content themselves with their lot,\nso that those with even modest talents\nare not employed by the world.\n\nTen or a hundred measures of grain—\nthose whose abilities suffice to govern ten or a hundred households.\nThey cherish life, so they value death;\nthey are content, so they do not wander far.\n\nThough there are carriages and boats,\nthere is no need to ride them;\nthough there are armor and weapons,\nthere is no need to display them;\n\nLet the people return to knotting cords for record-keeping and use them thus.\nWith few affairs and simple folk, even knotted cords suffice.\nThey find their food sweet, their garments fine, their dwellings secure, and their customs joyful.\nWith inner sufficiency and no external desires, they regard what they have as beauty,\nand where they dwell as delight—\nand seek no more.\n\nNeighboring states lie in sight, yet the sounds of roosters and dogs drift between them,\nwhile the people pass their lives to old age without visiting one another.\nThough goods and people abound, none seek what the other has—\nfor each already possesses enough.\n\n---\n**Chapter Eighty-One: Trustworthy Speech**\nTrustworthy speech is not ornate,\nornate speech is not trustworthy.\nTrustworthy speech is real—\nthus it need not be ornate.\nOrnate speech is merely appearance—\nthus it need not be trustworthy.\n\nThe virtuous do not argue,\nthose who argue are not virtuous.\nIf virtue is the foundation, argument is unnecessary;\nif argument is the foundation, virtue is uncertain.\n\nThe wise are not all-knowing,\nthe all-knowing are not wise.\nIf one principle unifies all things,\nthere is no need for vast learning.\nYet vast learning, ever increasing,\ndoes not necessarily lead to understanding the Dao.\n\nThe Sage accumulates nothing.\nThe more they give to others, the more they possess;\nthe more they share, the more they have.\nThe Sage holds fast to the One alone—\nthey accumulate nothing else.\nYet when they deploy their abilities for others,\nand extend their possessions to others,\nand others are exhausted while the One remains—\nonly then is the value of the One known.\n\n**Commentary by Zheng (政和曰):**\nGenerous giving succeeds without depletion,\nyet never consumes the giver.\nAll things draw from it without ever being exhausted.\nThe Dao of Heaven benefits without harming,\nthe Sage’s Dao acts without contention.\nWhat can benefit can also harm;\nwhat can act can also contend.\nYet the Sage, though capable of both,\nnever harms or contends.\nThis is how Heaven and the Sage surpass all others,\nand become the source for all things.\n\nAll this is how the *Laozi* presents its teachings\nand outlines its Dao in broad strokes—\nthus it repeats these themes at the end.\n\n**Zhuangzi’s Commentary (赵曰):**\nZhuangzi says the Master taught that accumulation is insufficiency,\nwhile non-hoarding is abundance.\nThe Sage’s Dao is like the sea:\ndraw from it, yet it is never exhausted;\ntake from it, yet it grows deeper.\nThus, the more they give to others, the more they possess;\nthe more they share, the more they have.\nThis is what Zhuangzi calls the Heavenly Treasury,\nwhat the Buddhists call the Limitless Storehouse.\n\nThe text concludes with the Dao of Heaven\nto clarify that this Dao aligns with Heaven’s Way.\n\n---\n*Dao De Jing (Moral and Virtue Classic) Collected Commentaries, Volume Four,

Cross-referenced text: The Wuxiu (無求備齐) reprint by Qian Peiming (錢培名) from the Xiaowan (小万) collection (published in Qing Chengfeng 4th year, abbreviated as Xiaowanben).*\n\n---\n\n**Volume One: Commentary by Zhao the Scholar**\n**Chapter One: \"The Dao That Can Be Spoken\"**\n\nThe Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao.\nIf it were not the eternal Dao, yet it can be spoken—how can it be eternal?\n\nNow, benevolence (仁), righteousness (义), propriety (礼), and wisdom (智)—these are the Dao that can be spoken.\nThe Dao that cannot be spoken: benevolence cannot be made into righteousness, propriety cannot be made into wisdom.\nThe Dao that can be spoken is not eternal #1, yet the Dao that cannot be spoken is eternal.\nThus, in benevolence, it is benevolence; in righteousness, it is righteousness; in propriety, it is propriety; in wisdom, it is wisdom.\nThe Dao that can be spoken is not eternal, yet the Dao itself does not change; the Dao that cannot be spoken is eternal, such is its nature.\n\nA name can be named, yet it is not the eternal name.\nThe Dao cannot be spoken, yet how much more so can it be named?\n\nAll names are merely the Dao that can be spoken.\nOnce names are established, distinctions between round and square, curved and straight, cannot be eternal.\n\nYanzun (严遵) and Junping (君平) said:\nHaving a name is not the Dao; not having a name is not the Dao.\nHaving form is not the Dao; not having form is not the Dao.\nWithout a name, yet nothing is without a name; without form, yet nothing is without form.\nWithout a name, it is the beginning of heaven and earth;\nWith a name, it is the mother of all things.\nEternal non-being, to observe its subtlety (妙);\nEternal being, to observe its transformations (徼).\nFrom its eternal non-being, form arises as heaven and earth,\nHeaven and earth stand, and names begin to be established.\nIt spreads as all things, all things follow the Dao, yet names cannot exhaust their use—\nThus, the eternal non-being is the essence of the Dao,\nAnd the eternal being is the manifestation of the Dao.\n\nThe sage embodies the Dao for the world’s use,\nEntering all things while remaining in eternal non-being,\nTo observe its subtlety (妙),\nAnd embodying the utmost non-being while remaining in eternal being,\nTo observe its transformations (徼).\nIf one acts only in its transformations and does not know its subtlety,\nIt is coarse and not profound.\nIf one drifts only in its subtlety and does not know its transformations,\nIt is refined yet not practical.\n\nSima Junshi (司马君实) said:\nCall the beginning of heaven and earth \"non-being\" (无),\nCall the mother of all things \"being\" (有).\nWang Xiu (王秀) said:\nBeing and non-being share the same essence,\nThe words \"beginning\" and \"mother\" are mere aids to understanding.\n\nWang Bi (王弼) believed:\n\"Eternal being\" (常有) is to observe its transformations (徼).\nIf one seeks eternal being, then how could one observe its transformations,\nWhen all things are drowned and lost in the myriad forms?\nAt the end, there are heaven and earth—who could name them?\n\nWithout a name, it is the beginning of heaven and earth;\nWith a name, then all things are born—hence, \"being\" is the mother of all things.\nZhuangzi (庄子) said:\nThe Old Master (老氏) established eternal non-being,\nNot founding any single thing—this is eternal non-being;\nNot abandoning any single thing #2—this is eternal being.\nEternal non-being lies in principle (理),\nIts heights are not bright—it is the utmost subtlety in the world, hence to observe its subtlety.\nEternal being lies in affairs (事),\nIts depths are not dark—it is the utmost transformation in the world, hence to observe its transformations.\nTo abandon being is to cling to emptiness,\nTo follow transformations is to forget the root—\nThus, great wisdom observes both.\n\nThese two are the same source yet different names,\nBoth called \"profound\" (玄).\nSpeaking in terms of form,\nBeing and non-being seem to be two.\n\nHow do you know that non-being moves to become being,\nAnd being returns to become non-being?\nThey have never ceased to be one.\nThough their names differ, their root is the same—\nKnowing that their root is one, then it is profound.\n\nAll that is distant yet without ultimate limit,\nIts hue must be profound—\nThus, the Old Master (老子) often speaks of \"profound\" to convey the utmost.\n\nTaiping Guangshi (太平光师) said:\nOpposition gives rise to names.\nProfound beyond profound, the gateway to all subtleties.\nProfound beyond profound again, it reaches its limit—\nYet there remains a mind that knows of the profound.\nProfound beyond profound again, it is exhausted—\nNo further addition can be made,\nThe gateway through which all subtleties emerge.\nGuang (光) said:\nTo forget the profoundness of the profound, then it is called \"profound beyond profound.\"\n\nZhao Bingwen (赵秉文) said:\nThis chapter reveals the ultimate profundity of the \"double profound\" (重玄),\nNot merely that the Dao that can be spoken is not the Dao,\nNor that the Dao that cannot be spoken is not the Dao.\nZhuangzi said:\nWords and silence are both insufficient to exhaust the Dao—\nNot only is the Dao eternally without name,\nBut even having a name or not having a name is insufficient to exhaust the Dao.\n\nThe eternal non-being is the semblance of the Dao.\nEternal non-being is what the Buddhist schools call \"true emptiness\" (真空);\nEternal being is what the Buddhist schools call \"marvelous existence\" (妙有).\nBoth being and non-being are insufficient to exhaust the Dao—\nThus, it is entrusted to the \"double profound.\"\n\nZhenghe (政和) said:\nProfound is the hue of heaven,\nThe hue that colors all hues is manifest,\nYet the coloring of hues is never displayed.\nProfound beyond profound is the coloring of hues.\nThe profound subtleties of principle,\nAll things possess them together.\nHeaven’s movements, earth’s positions,\nHuman consciousness, the flourishing of all things—\nAll are subtleties, yet all emerge from the profound—\nThus, it is called the \"gateway to all subtleties.\"\n\n**Chapter Two: \"When All Under Heaven Know\"**\n\nWhen all under heaven know beauty as beauty,\nThen ugliness is already present.\nWhen all under heaven know goodness as goodness,\nThen non-goodness is already present.\n\nThus, being and non-being generate each other,\nDifficulty and ease complete each other,\nLong and short define each other,\nHigh and low depend on each other,\nSounds and voices harmonize each other,\nBefore and after follow each other.\n\nAll under heaven speaks of beauty and ugliness in terms of form and name,\nYet what they call \"beautiful and good\" (美且善),\nIs it truly beautiful and good?\nThey do not know that being and non-being,\nDifficulty and ease,\nLong and short,\nHigh and low,\nSounds and voices,\nBefore and after—\nAll mutually oppose each other,\nNone of them is their true nature.\n\nJust when one considers oneself long,\nThere is one longer than me who stands before me—\nThen I am short.\nJust when one considers oneself foremost,\nThere is one who comes before me—\nThen I am behind.",

      "translated_text": "If one follows what is deemed beautiful and accepts it as true,\nThen one will stray far from the Way.\n\nZhao said:\nBeing and non-being generate each other—\nJust as high must have low,\nThus, though being and non-being differ,\nBoth ultimately escape not-being.\n\nThis speaks of how forms take shape,\nHence, borrowing the expressions of being and non-being to dispel them.\n\nGuang said:\nThese six pairs are why things are unequal,\nOnly those who have lost their counterpart can harmonize them.\n\nZhenghe said:\nThe Dao has no differing appearances—\nWho decides what is beautiful or ugly?\nNature is inherently unified—\nWho decides what is good or evil?\n\nThere is beauty, and ugliness opposes it,\nThus, it is said: \"All under heaven knows beauty as beauty,\nYet ugliness already exists.\"\nThere is goodness, and unkindness opposes it,\nThus, it is said: \"All under heaven knows goodness as goodness,\nYet unkindness already exists.\"\n\nBefore the Supreme Ultimate was divided,\nAll phenomena shared a single body.\nOnce the Two Forces emerged,\nAll things became paired opposites.\n\nThese six pairs arise from myriad transformations,\nFrom a hundred thoughts,\nFrom divergent paths—\nThe way the world’s people drown and cannot extricate themselves.\n\nThus, the Sage acts in non-action,\nTeaches without speaking.\nWhen acting, the mind is one of non-action;\nWhen teaching, the intent is one of non-speech.\n\nWithin proper measure, transcending long and short,\nBeyond the sequence of before and after,\nNeither beautiful nor ugly,\nNeither good nor evil—\nThen how could the world truly know it?\n\nLü Huiqing said:\nThe Sage acts all day yet never acts,\nSpeaks all day yet never speaks.\nAll things act without refusal,\nAre born without possession,\nAct without reliance,\nAnd upon completion, does not claim.\n\nAll things act for me, yet I refuse none.\nI give birth to them yet possess nothing,\nRely on nothing.\nWhen their work is done,\nI do not claim it as my own.\nThis is the teaching of non-action and non-speech—\nHow could ugliness or evil follow such beauty and goodness?\n\nOnly by not claiming does one not lose.\nThe Sage dwells in poverty and lowliness without fear of poverty or lowliness;\nDwells in wealth and honor without the burden of wealth and honor—\nThis is called not claiming.\nIf I do not claim, how could others take it away?\nThis is the ultimate dwelling.\n\nZhenghe said:\nAll things act in parallel,\nResponding to stimuli without refusal.\nThey shape themselves, transform themselves,\nGive birth to themselves, and manifest their own colors—\nWho could possess them?\n\nZhao said:\nThere is non-action in opposition and true non-action;\nThere is non-speech in opposition and true non-speech.\nNon-action and speech in opposition—\nLike the pairs of being and non-being, high and low—what difference is there?\nBut true non-action and non-speech—\nAre those who have lost their counterpart and severed dependence.\n\n**Chapter Three: Not Exalting the Virtuous**\nNot exalting the virtuous prevents the people from striving;\nNot treasuring hard-to-obtain goods prevents theft;\nNot displaying what is desirable prevents disorder of the heart.\n\nThus, the Sage’s governance:\nEmpties the mind, fills the belly,\nWeakens the will, strengthens the bones.\n\nIf one exalts the virtuous, the people will be ashamed of not measuring up and thus contend;\nIf one treasures hard-to-obtain goods, the people will suffer from lack and thus steal;\nIf one displays what is desirable, the people will suffer from not obtaining it and thus rebel.\n\nThough all under heaven knows these three as calamities,\nIf one attempts to abolish them, one will only be confused.\nThe Sage is not thus.\n\nHe has never failed to use the virtuous—\nOnly he does not exalt them;\nHe has never abandoned hard-to-obtain goods—\nOnly he does not treasure them;\nHe has never removed what is desirable—\nOnly he does not display them.\n\nThus, the virtuous are employed yet the people do not contend;\nHard-to-obtain goods and desirable things are present yet theft and chaos do not arise—\nIs this not emptying the mind while not harming the belly’s fullness,\nWeakening the will while not harming the bones’ strength?\n\nNow, if one were to exalt and promote the virtuous,\nTreasure and honor goods,\nDisplay and flaunt what is desirable—\nThen both mind and belly would be filled.\nIf one were to abolish them, then will and bones would weaken.\nWhen mind and belly are filled, the people will not contend;\nWhen will and bones are weakened, no undertaking can stand.\n\nZhao said:\nEmptying the mind and filling the belly—\nThis means the ruler does not exalt, does not treasure, does not display,\nSo the people have no knowledge and no desires.\nSome say emptying the mind nurtures the Dao,\nThough this may be justifiable, it is not the intent of this passage.\nRather, it is to always keep the people without knowledge and desire,\nSo that even the wise dare not act.\n\nThe Sage’s governance aims only to let the people preserve their nature and life.\nExcessive knowledge harms the division of nature and life,\nExcessive desire wounds the essence of nature and life.\nCalled \"governance\" yet what greater chaos could there be?\n\nThus, always keep the people without knowledge and desire,\nDo not deceive them with falsehoods,\nThen the people will not yearn for anything,\nTheir desires will be simple and uncluttered—\nEven the wise will have no schemes to employ.\n\nZhao said:\nWithout yearning, they dare not act.\nZhenghe said:\nThe eloquent dare not display their cleverness,\nThe brave dare not unleash their hostility,\nThe capable dare not boast of their talents,\nThe wise dare not apply their insight—\nThis is called \"making the wise dare not act.\"\n\nActing in non-action, nothing will remain ungoverned.\nUsing these three naturally while not exalting, not treasuring, not displaying—\nThis is called acting in non-action.\n\nZhenghe said:\nThe Sage’s governance does not abandon people or reject things,\nNor does it imagine standing alone in a realm of non-action.\nIt is simply emerging from non-action.\n\nThings have their actions—\nFollow them to observe their return;\nThings have their births—\nGuide them to achieve completion—\nHow could there be no governance?\n\n**Chapter Four: The Dao is Unobstructed**\nThe Dao is unobstructed yet used—\nSeemingly not full, yet profound,\nLike the origin of all things.\n\nThe Dao is unobstructed, reaching the utmost non-being,\nYet with it, it adapts to all things—\nThough vast as heaven and earth,\nBroad as mountains and rivers,\nIt pervades everywhere without form,\nThus it seems not full.",

themselves,\nStanding beyond all things.\nThus they endure eternally.\nThe Sage yields his own life yet comes before others,\nSets his own life aside yet benefits others,\nStanding apart from the crowd,\nThus he comes first and is preserved.\n\nIf Heaven and Earth competed with things to generate,\nAnd the Sage contended with people for gain,\nThen Heaven and Earth would be but one thing,\nAnd the Sage but one person—\nHow could they surpass all others?\n\nThough he has no selfishness,\nIt is not to seek selfishness’ fulfillment,\nYet selfishness is fulfilled through him.\nThe Dao is simply thus.\n\n**Jiuji said:**\nThe Sage aligns with Heaven and Earth,\nYielding his own life, setting it aside,\nAs Heaven and Earth do not generate themselves,\nHis life comes first, is preserved,\nAs Heaven and Earth endure eternally.\nYielding his own life—\nHe places himself below others,\nThus his life comes first.\nSetting his own life aside—\nOthers protect him,\nThus his life is preserved.\n\n**Chapter Eight: The Supreme Good is Like Water**\nThe supreme good is like water,\nWater benefits all things yet does not contend,\nDwelling where people revile—\nThus it nears the Dao.\n\n*The Classic of Changes* says:\nOne yin, one yang—\nThis is called the Dao,\nThe continuation of it is virtue,\nThe fulfillment of it is nature.\n\nAgain it says:\nHeaven’s One generates water.\nThe Dao manifests as virtue,\nLike *qi* forming water—\nHence the supreme good is like water.\n\nBoth arise from the formless and achieve form,\nThus their principles are the same.\n\nThe Dao is present everywhere,\nBenefits all things—\nWater does likewise.\nYet once it clings to form,\nIt diverges from the Dao,\nHence it is said: *it nears the Dao*.\nYet among named virtues,\nNone surpass this—\nHence the supreme good.\n\nDwelling in virtue’s ground,\nMind in virtue’s depths,\nAligned with virtue’s benevolence,\nSpeech in virtue’s trust,\nGovernance in virtue’s order,\nActions in virtue’s skill,\nMovements in virtue’s timing.\n\nAvoiding heights, seeking lows,\nNever acting against nature—\nThis is virtue’s ground.\nEmpty, still, profound—\nFathomless depths—\nThis is virtue’s mind.\nBenefiting all things,\nGiving without seeking return—\nThis is virtue’s benevolence.\nWhen confined, it turns—\nWhen straight, it bends—\nWhen blocked, it stops—\nWhen released, it flows—\nThis is virtue’s trust.\nWashing clean all impurities,\nBalancing high and low—\nThis is virtue’s order.\nMeeting things, it takes their form,\nYet does not linger—\nThis is virtue’s skill.\nIn winter it congeals,\nIn spring it thaws—\nIn drought it recedes,\nIn flood it swells,\nNever losing its rhythm—\nThis is virtue’s timing.\n\nOnly because it does not contend,\nIt has no grievances.\nIf virtue exists yet is not spared,\nIt is because of contention.\nWater does not contend,\nYet possesses seven virtues,\nAnd has no grievances.\n\n**Chapter Nine: Holding Yet Filling**\nHolding yet filling—\nBetter than its fullness.\nGrasping yet sharpening—\nCannot long endure.\n\nKnowing fullness must overflow,\nAnd holding it firm,\nBetter than letting it not fill.\nKnowing sharpness must break,\nAnd grasping it first,\nYet knowing grasping cannot ensure safety.\n\nIf the Sage has yet does not hold,\nHow could there be fullness?\nFollowing principle then acting,\nHow could there be sharpness?\n\nNo fullness means no need for holding,\nNo sharpness means no need for grasping.\n\n**Zhenghe said:**\nHolding fullness to prevent overflow,\nYet filling it—\nThis invites greater overflow,\nThus its nature must decline.\nIf one wishes to avoid overflow,\nBetter to avoid fullness entirely.\nGrasping to fear loss,\nYet sharpening it—\nThis invites greater loss.\nIf one wishes to avoid loss,\nBetter to avoid sharpening entirely.\n\nGold and jade fill the hall,\nYet none can guard them.\nRiches and honor bring arrogance,\nThus one invites his own blame.\n\nWhen achievement is complete,\nName is secured,\nRetire—\nThis is Heaven’s Way.\nMidday sun must move,\nFull moon must wane—\nThe rhythm of the four seasons,\nAchievers depart.\nHeaven and Earth do this—\nHow much more so for people?\n\n**Zhenghe said:**\nHe who hoards gold and jade\nIs burdened by things,\nBurdened by things—\nHow could he avoid loss?\nThus none can guard them.\nRiches and honor bring arrogance,\nHarming his virtue,\nHarmed in virtue—\nHow could he escape misfortune?\nThus he invites his own blame.\n\n**Chapter Ten: Carrying the Vital Essence**\nCarrying the vital essence,\nEmbracing the One—\nCould it avoid separation?\n\nThe vital essence differs from the spirit,\nFor the vital essence is material,\nThe spirit is divine.\n*The Classic of Changes* says:\nEssence and *qi* form things,\nThe wandering spirit brings change—\nThus one knows the nature of ghosts and gods.\n\nThe vital essence is material,\nThus it is mixed and fixed;\nThe spirit is divine,\nThus it is singular and ever-changing.\nCalled the vital essence—\nThis speaks of its fixation.\nThe Dao is present everywhere,\nIn humans it is nature,\nAnd nature’s subtlety is the spirit.",

following its own inherent truth.\n\nThe sage’s nature is steadfast,\nHis spirit is concentrated,\nNot swayed by things.\nThough he takes the *arc* (vital essence) as his dwelling,\nWhen his spirit wishes to move,\nThe *arc* follows without fail—\nThus his spirit is always carried by the *arc*.\n\nThe common folk are enslaved by things,\nTheir spirit is dull and ungoverned,\nThus their spirit is subject to the *arc*.\n\nThe ears and eyes are burdened by sounds and colors,\nThe mouth and nose labor over smells and tastes;\nWhen the *arc* wishes to move,\nThe spirit follows—\nThus the *arc* is always embraced by the spirit.\n\nTherefore, he is taught to embrace the spirit and carry the *arc*,\nSo that the two never separate—\nThis is indeed the essential method of the sage’s self-cultivation.\n\nAs for the ancient *true person* (真人),\nWith deep roots and firm foundations,\nThe Dao of longevity and enduring vision—\nIt is the same.\n\nLu said: *\"Arc\"* is the beginning of speech.\nZhenghe said: The *arc* is yin.\nResiding in the body with fixed purpose,\nThus Laozi spoke of the *arc* as \"vital essence.\"\n\nThe spirit is yang.\nSupported by *qi* yet unbound in its movement,\nThus *The Classic of Changes* spoke of the spirit as \"wandering.\"\n\nThe sage governs his form with the spirit,\nAnd controls the *arc* with the spirit—\nThus the spirit is always carried by the spirit,\nAnd never by the *arc*.\n\nHeaven’s One generates water,\nWhich in things becomes essence;\nEarth’s Two generates fire,\nWhich in things becomes spirit.\nSpirit and essence arise from the Dao,\nThe form is born from essence;\nGuarding them without loss,\nAnd uniting them with the spirit—\nThen essence and spirit coalesce without admixture.\n\nWith essence to gather the spirit,\nWith the spirit to direct the form,\nWith the form to sustain the spirit—\nEssence complete yet undiminished,\nSpirit active yet not overbearing,\nForm alive yet not exhausted—\nLike the sun and moon adorned upon heaven,\nLike grasses and trees adorned upon earth,\nNever once separating.\n\nConcentrating *qi* to attain softness,\nCould one achieve the state of an infant?\nIf the spirit is ungoverned, *qi* is disordered,\nThe strong delight in contention,\nThe weak delight in fear,\nUnaware of themselves.\n\nIf the spirit is governed, *qi* does not act recklessly,\nJoy and anger follow their proper kinds—\nThis is called concentrating *qi*.\n\nThe spirit is the utmost of emptiness,\n*Qi* is the beginning of substance;\nThe extreme of emptiness is softness,\nThe extreme of substance is hardness.\nPure nature without *qi* is called attaining softness—\nThe infant knows no good or evil,\nThus his nature is complete.\n\nNature complete yet *qi* subtle,\n*Qi* subtle yet the body soft—\nConcentrating *qi* to attain softness,\nTo achieve the state of an infant is the pinnacle.\n\nZhenghe said: Stillness without admixture is called concentration,\nHarmony without excess is called softness.\n\nThe infant at rest does not know his actions,\nIn motion does not know his destination,\nHolding no judgments of right or wrong, good or evil—\nThus his *qi* is concentrated and softness attained.\n\nMencius said: Stumbling, rushing—\nThis is *qi*.\nYet if the heart is moved against it,\nThe heart cannot concentrate *qi*—\nThen *qi* has the irregularity of stumbling and rushing,\nAnd the heart reaches the point of being moved.\nWhen moved, it cannot be restrained.\n\nThe sage empties himself to wander in the world,\nHis heart does not force *qi* to act—\nThus his stillness is without admixture,\nHis harmony is without excess,\nAnd what difference is there between him and the infant?\nHence it is said: Could one achieve the state of an infant?\n\nPurification and boundless vision,\nCould one avoid deception?\nThe sage externally is not carried by the *arc*,\nInternally is not directed by *qi*—\nThus his purification of dust and filth is complete.\n\nThen his spirit is vast and boundless,\nKnowing all things arise from nature,\nEqually observing the pure and the impure without bias or deception.\nPurifying all actions yet not possessing them,\nBoundless vision of subtle principles yet silently recognizing them.\n\nLoving the people and governing the state,\nCould one avoid action?\nHaving already cultivated the self,\nHe extends this further to all people—\nEven reaching the point of loving the people and governing the state,\nHe meets them all with a heart of non-action.\n\nIf he were to act with a heart,\nThen loving the people would harm them,\nAnd governing the state would disrupt it.\n\nThe opening and closing of the heavenly gates,\nCould one act as the female?\nThe heavenly gates are the source of order and chaos, decay and flourishing.\nHaving already entrusted oneself to the world,\nIn the intervals of opening and closing,\nThe common folk value gain and fear loss,\nThus they act in advance to seek fortune.\n\nThe sage follows principle to know the mandate of Heaven,\nThus he waits for the lead before harmonizing.\n\n*The Classic of Changes* says:\n\"Act before Heaven and Heaven will not oppose you—\nThis is not acting before Heaven;\nAct after Heaven and follow the timing of Heaven—\nThis is not acting after Heaven.\"\nIt speaks of acting before or after,\nAlways aligning with the mandate of Heaven.\n\nOtherwise, acting before Heaven would be too early,\nActing after Heaven would be too late—\nBoth would be mistaken.\n\nThus, what is called \"acting as the female\"\nIs also nothing but not losing the proper time.\n\nZhenghe said: Knowing the male, guarding the female,\nThis is the valley of the world.\n\nClear and all-encompassing,\nCould one avoid knowing?\nInternally cultivating the self,\nExternally governing the state—\nEven reaching the point of facing changes,\nThere is no action without method—\nIs this not the clarity and all-encompassing nature of the heart?\n\nThe heart is singular—\nIf there is again a heart that knows,\nThen this is twofold.\nFrom singularity to duality,\nBias begins here,\nAnd foolishness takes root.\n\nNow, the mirror’s relation to things—\nWhen they come, it responds—\nAnd yet, how could it know the things that respond to it?\nThe source is without knowing,\nYet if knowing is added by intention,\nThis is the origin of falsehood.\n\nZhenghe said: Bright wisdom and sagely intelligence,\nGuarded by them with foolishness.\n\nNurturing and storing life,\nNurturing without possessing,\nActing without relying,\nGrowing without controlling—\nThis is called *mysterious virtue* (玄德).\n\nIts Dao suffices to nurture and store all things,\nYet it does not possess, rely, or control them.\nThough it has great virtue,\nThings know it not—\nThus it is called *mysterious virtue*.\n\nWang Pan said: This chapter exhausts the sequence of self-cultivation,\nFrom the scholar to the attainment of entering sainthood

      "translated_text": "**Chapter Twelve: The Five Colors**\nWhen clay is shaped into vessels,\nIt is their emptiness that gives them use.\nWhen doors and windows are carved for a house,\nIt is their emptiness that gives it use.\nThus, having is for utility,\nBut emptiness is for function.\n\nExhausting knowledge to craft vessels,\nTheir use lies always in their emptiness.\nWithout emptiness, there is no use—\nWithout use, there is no utility.\nThus, the Sage observes the mysterious through emptiness,\nAnd observes the ordinary through having.\nTo know these two as one, indivisible,\nIs to attain the utmost.\n\nThe five colors blind the eyes,\nThe five tones deafen the ears,\nThe five flavors dull the palate.\nTo see colors, hear sounds, taste flavors—\nTheir origin lies in nature itself,\nYet no thing exists in them.\nThis is the utmost.\n\nBut when the eyes cling to the five colors,\nThe ears to the five tones,\nThe mouth to the five flavors,\nAnd they lose their original nature,\nThen though they see, they are truly blind;\nThough they hear, they are truly deaf;\nThough they taste, they are truly dull.\n\n**Luóshì** said:\nIf one does not know the emptiness of form and sound,\nHow is it different from blindness and deafness?\n\nHunting and chasing game drives the mind to madness,\nRare treasures cause one to act recklessly.\nThus, the Sage nourishes the belly, not the eyes.\nHence, he discards the former and takes the latter.\n\nThe Sage’s seeing of colors, hearing of sounds, and tasting of flavors\nAre the same as others’.\nYet when it comes to hunting and chasing game,\nHe never does so,\nAnd when it comes to rare treasures,\nHe never uses them.\n\nYet people consider this a disease,\nWhile the Sage alone considers it a blessing.\nWhy so?\n\nThe Sage nourishes the belly, while the common man nourishes the eyes.\nThe eyes are greedy and cannot receive,\nBut the belly receives without greed.\n\nExternal things come from without,\nWhile nature solidifies within.\n\n**Lù** said:\nNourishing the belly means knowing contentment,\nNot nourishing the eyes means not seeing what is desirable.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Thirteen: Honor and Humiliation**\nHonor and humiliation are like sudden shocks,\nGreat calamities are like the body itself.\n\nThe ancient enlightened ones were shocked by honor as by humiliation,\nKnowing that honor is the root of humiliation.\nThey valued the body as they valued great calamities,\nKnowing that the body is the root of calamity.\n\nThus, they abandoned honor and humiliation did not reach them,\nThey forgot the body and calamity did not come.\n\nWhat is meant by honor and humiliation?\nHonor is low—\nTo gain it is like a shock,\nTo lose it is like a shock—\nThis is called *honor and humiliation as shocks*.\n\nHonor and humiliation are not two things.\nHumiliation arises from honor, yet the world does not realize it.\nThose who consider honor superior and humiliation inferior\nAre all mistaken.\n\nIf one knows that humiliation arises from honor,\nThen honor is indeed low.\n\nThus, the ancient enlightened ones were shocked by honor,\nNever resting in honor while fearing humiliation.\nWhat is meant by *shocks*?\nNot true shock—\nOnly the appearance of shock.\n\n**Guāng** said:\nOnly when the emotions of the common and the Sage are exhausted\nIs there no shock.\n\nWhat is meant by *valuing great calamity as the body*?\nThe reason I have great calamity\nIs that I have a body.\nWhen I have no body,\nWhat calamity do I have?\n\n*Noble* means *difficult*.\nThe body is the root of great calamity,\nYet scholars of the world find it difficult to endure great calamity,\nBut not difficult to have a body.\n\nThus, the Sage guides them to find difficulty in having a body,\nKnowing that when having a body is difficult,\nGreat calamity departs.\n\nNature, in relation to man,\nCannot be increased by life or diminished by death.\nIts vastness can fill heaven and earth,\nIts subtlety can traverse water and fire, enter metal and stone—\nNo thing can harm it.\n\nYet the world suffers from losing its original nature,\nAnd only values the body.\nSeeing the depth of love for the body,\nThings begin to harm it.\n\nThe changes of life and death, sickness and health\nAssail from within,\nThe changes of honor and humiliation, gain and loss\nAssail from without—\nThere is not a single thing that is not calamity.\n\nOnly the enlightened know that nature cannot be destroyed,\nAnd that the body is not real.\nSuddenly forgetting the body,\nAll the world’s calamities vanish,\nThen one can traverse the world without burden.\n\n**Zhào** said:\nZhào said that the greatest calamity is having a body,\nThus, annihilating the body to return to non-being—\nThis is the realm of the Two Vehicles.\n\nThose who discuss the Dao take\nNot being shocked by honor and humiliation,\nAbandoning the body and extinguishing wisdom\nAs the ultimate standard.\nHow could they know the Sage’s true intent?\n\n**Zhènghé** said:\nTo grasp power and authority,\nTo monopolize rewards and punishments,\nTo create blessings and threats—\nThe world fears them like deities,\nReveres them like Heavenly Sovereigns—\nThis is called *noble*.\n\nThe Sage does not burden himself with nobility,\nThus he can long preserve nobility without calamity.\n\nIt is like the human body:\nFalling into limbs, losing clarity,\nSeparating from form, abandoning wisdom,\nUniting with the Great Harmony—\nThen there is nowhere one does not find oneself at ease.\n\nThe world’s people exchange nature for things,\nThus they are burdened by things and forget their power;\nThey burden the mind with the body,\nThus they lose the mind and cannot forget the body—\nTheir calamity is great.\n\nEven death and life are great,\nYet they bring no change to oneself.\nHow much more so with the gains and losses of fortune and misfortune!\n\nThis is why the ancient Perfect Ones\nDid not burden the form with advantage,\nDid not burden the mind with the body,\nAnd when viewing all things with themselves,\nThey could find no choice—\nThen the body was not their own.\n\nAbove, they played with the Creator,\nBelow, they made companions of those beyond life and death,\nBeyond beginning and end—\nWhat calamity could I have?\n\nHonor is what the world esteems,\nYet they consider it humiliation;\nNobility is what people desire,\nYet they consider it calamity.\n\nTruly, external things are unreliable—\nThis is the

vessel—\nOnly the Dao can set it in motion;\nThe world is a divine vessel—\nOnly the Dao can hold it fast.\n\nThe Sage embodies the Dao,\nSo in yielding to the world, the world finds joy in being led\nAnd never tires of it.\n\nThose who follow, knowing their own worth,\nYet do not degrade themselves to serve things,\nCan be entrusted with the world—\nKnowing their love for the body,\nYet do not harm themselves in its constraints,\nCan be relied upon with the world.\n\nThus it is said:\nThe true Dao begins with cultivating oneself,\nIts threads extend to governing the state,\nAnd its roots reach to ruling the world.\n\nYet the world’s so-called gentlemen\nEndanger their bodies and abandon their lives\nTo chase after things—\nIs this not tragic?\n\nGuang states:\nThings are a burden to the body,\nThe body is a burden to the Dao.\nTo forget things is to preserve the body,\nTo forget the body is to fulfill the Dao.\n\nThough they forget external encumbrances,\nTheir love for nobility and worth still remains—\nThey can be entrusted and relied upon.\n\nWhen both body and things are forgotten,\nAnd one takes the Dao upon themselves,\nThey contain the world within the world.\n\nZhao states:\nIf one treats the world’s burdens as their own,\nThen they forget nobility and worth,\nAnd thus can be entrusted and relied upon to govern the world.\n\nThe ancient Sages,\nThough seated in the honored position of the ruler,\nSaw themselves as mountain forest hermits,\nUnmoved by sounds and colors, riches and nobility—\nThen the world could not burden them.\n\n**Chapter Fourteen: The Formless Form**\nWhat is unseen when viewed is called *Yi* (平),\nWhat is unheard when listened to is called *Xi* (希),\nWhat is untouched when grasped is called *Wei* (微).\n\nThese three cannot be summoned or invited,\nSo they merge and become one.\n\nWhat is seen when viewed is color.\nYet what allows color to be seen\nIs the unseen itself.\n\nWhat is heard when listened to is sound.\nYet what allows sound to be heard\nIs the unheard itself.\n\nWhat is obtained when grasped is touch.\nYet what allows touch to be obtained\nIs the untouchable itself.\n\nThough wise men cannot question these three,\nThey must merge and return to one\nBefore it can be so.\n\nThis so-called \"one\" is *Xing* (性),\nAnd the three are its manifestations.\n\nMan begins with *Xing* alone—\nYet when it entangles with things,\nIt splits and scatters,\nBecoming sight, hearing, and touch.\nThey use it daily without reflecting on its source,\nAnd when it merges back into one,\nThey grow ever more distant from it.\n\nIf one extends this further,\nThen the Buddha’s teaching on the six senses is the same.\nThe *Shoulengyan* Sutra says:\n*\"Reverse the flow to attain oneness—\nThe six functions then cease.\"*\n\nThis is what is meant.\n\nZhao states:\n*\"Yi\"* (平), *\"Xi\"* (希), *\"Wei\"* (微), *\"Yi\"* (一)—\nAll are strong names for the Dao.\n\nThe Dao’s subtle essence\nConfounds the mind and cannot be known,\nSilences the tongue and cannot be spoken—\nHow could it be perceived through sight, hearing, or touch?\n\nCommon men see only color,\nHear only sound—\nThis is not true knowing.\n\nIf one attains the seeing of the unseen,\nAnd sees not with the eyes but with the ears;\nIf one attains the hearing of the unheard,\nAnd hears not with the ears but with the eyes—\nThen the eyes become like ears,\nThe ears become like noses,\nAnd the six senses intermingle—\nThis is Zhuangzi’s *Qi-ting* (气听),\nAnd Liezi’s *Shi-ting* (视听).\n\nWithout relying on ears and eyes,\nThey merge and become one.\n\nAbove, it does not blaze,\nBelow, it does not fade.\n\nAll things with form\nAre adorned by yin and yang,\nSo their brilliance above and dimness below cannot be evaded.\n\nYet the Dao,\nThough present above, does not blaze,\nThough present below, does not fade—\nIt cannot be traced through forms or numbers.\n\nLu states:\n*\"Above, it shines like the sun and moon—\nIts light does not blaze;\nBelow, it rests like tiles and rubble—\nIts clarity does not fade.\"*\n\nContinuous without end—\nIt cannot be named.\nContinuous, it runs without cessation.\n\nMen see its ceaseless motion,\nAnd assume there must be a thing—\nYet they do not know it ultimately returns to nothingness.\n\nThis is called the form of the formless,\nThe image of the imageless—\nThe *Huanghuang* (惚恍).\n\nThe form of its manifestation,\nThe image of its subtlety—\nThe formless form, the imageless image—\nNone of these are truly without.\n\nThe named \"having\" and \"not having\" cannot be defined—\nThis is called *Huanghuang* (惚恍).\n\nLu states:\n*\"Continuously running without cessation,\nIt cannot be named—\nThough it undergoes myriad transformations,\nIt ultimately returns to nothingness.\nYet the Dao’s true essence is refined,\nNot truly without substance—\nBut it cannot be grasped by sight, hearing, or touch,\nSo it is called the form of the formless,\nThe image of the shapeless.\nWhen spoken of as form, it seems vague as nothingness,\nWhen spoken of as image, it seems indistinct as somethingness.\"*\n\nTo confront it, one does not see its beginning,\nTo follow it, one does not see its end.\n\nThe Dao is present everywhere—\nThus there is no beginning or end to be seen.\n\nLu states:\n*\"Its origin is unknown,\nSo one does not see

hold that from which they originate,\nThen their advance and retreat, their swiftness and slowness,\nAre all within oneself.\n\nLu states:\n*\"Only those who hold the ancient Dao of non-action\nAnd wield it against the present’s pretenses of action\nCan return to purity and simplicity,\nAnd restore themselves to the initial state of the ancient past.\nTo know the ancient purity and simplicity,\nThis is the great Dao’s framework.\"*\n\nLü states:\n*\"This so-called 'ancient' is not different from the present—\nIt is the knowing of the ancient’s origin.\nThis so-called 'present' is not different from the ancient—\nIt is the knowing of the present’s source.\nIf one truly knows the ancient’s origin,\nThen one knows the present’s source—\nThe beginning has no origin,\nThe source

scorn it.\n\nTrust is insufficient, so there is distrust.\nIf I truly trust myself,\nThen governing the world with **Dao** is enough.\nBut if I do not trust myself,\nAnd add *virtue* and *righteousness*,\nAnd burden it with laws and governance,\nThen the people will begin to distrust.\n\nEven so, they value words—\nWhen deeds are accomplished and affairs settled,\nThe people say of me: *\"This is natural.\"*\n\nThe Sage trusts abundantly—\nIn matters of speech,\nHe still prizes it, yet does not lightly utter words,\nAnd so the people trust him.\n\nWhen deeds are accomplished and affairs settled,\nThe people daily drift toward goodness and away from crime,\nYet they do not know it themselves.\n\n**Chapter Eighteen: The Great Dao is Discarded**\nThe Great Dao discards *virtue* and *righteousness*;\nWhen the Great Dao flourishes,\n*Virtue* and *righteousness* arise within it,\nYet the people do not know it.\nOnce **Dao** is discarded,\nThen *virtue* and *righteousness* appear.\n\n*Wisdom* and *cleverness* emerge, so great falsehood arises;\nThe world does not know that **Dao** suffices to nourish all things,\nYet they add *wisdom* and *cleverness* to it,\nAnd so the people begin to repay with falsehood.\n\nThe six bonds of kinship are disunited, yet there is filial *virtue* and kindness;\nThe state is in chaos, yet loyal ministers arise.\nWhen the six bonds of kinship are united,\nWho is not filial and kind?\nWhen the state is well-ordered,\nWho is not a loyal minister?\nYao was not unfilial,\nYet he alone praised Shun—\nThere was no blind father.\nI Yin

breath,\nMutually moisten each other with their dampness—\nNot as good as forgetting each other in the rivers and lakes.\n\n**Chapter Nineteen: Discard the Sage, Abandon Wisdom**\nDiscard the Sage, abandon *wisdom*—\nThe people benefit a hundredfold;\nIt is not that *wisdom* is insufficient to know **Dao**,\nBut if the Sage and *wisdom* govern the world,\nWho would not use **Dao** to rule things?\nThe people of the world are insufficient to know the root of *wisdom*,\nYet they see its superficial aspects,\nAnd take it for cleverness in overcoming things—\nThus they rush about in its shallows,\nAnd the people begin to suffer its harm.\n\nTherefore, discard the Sage, abandon *wisdom*—\nThe people benefit a hundredfold.\nDiscard *virtue* and *righteousness*—\nThe people return to filial *virtue* and kindness;\nThere has never been one who practices *virtue* yet forsakes their parents,\nNor one who upholds *righteousness* yet places their ruler after themselves.\n*Virtue* and *righteousness* are the means to filial *virtue* and kindness,\nBut when they decline,\nThey steal the name of *virtue* and *righteousness*\nTo seek advantage in the world—\nThen sons defy fathers,\nFathers cruelly oppress sons—\nThis is the work of *virtue* and *righteousness*’s traces,\nHence the saying.\n\nDiscard cleverness, abandon profit—\nThen thieves and robbers will cease.\nCleverness is used to facilitate affairs,\nProfit is used to aid things—\nThese two are not meant for thieves,\nYet if thieves and robbers cannot act,\nThen they will not arise,\nHence the saying.\n\nThese three—\nIf they are insufficient as adornments,\nThen they must have their proper uses.\nSeeing simplicity, embracing purity—\nFew private desires, little greed.\nThe world values these three,\nYet they say the world’s unrest comes from the insufficiency of adornments.\nThus some attach them to the Sage and *wisdom*,\nSome to *virtue* and *righteousness*,\nSome to cleverness and profit—\nThey would use adornments to govern it.\n\nYet the world grows ever more unstable—\nWhy not return to their root?\nSeeing simplicity, embracing purity—\nFew private desires, little greed—\nYet the world returns to its own nature,\nEven if these three exist,\nThey have no use for them.\n\nTherefore it is said:\nI do nothing, yet the people transform themselves;\nI love stillness, yet the people become upright;\nI have no affairs, yet the people grow rich;\nI have no desires, yet the people return to simplicity—\nThis is the clarity of the Sage’s great *wisdom*,\nThe utmost of *virtue* and *righteousness*,\nThe perfection of cleverness and profit.\n\nYet Confucius used the seven *righteousnesses*, rites, and music to govern the world,\nWhile Laozi discarded and abandoned them—\nSome may say they differ.\n\nThe *Yijing* says:\nWhat is above *form* is called **Dao**,\nWhat is below *form* is called *instruments*.\nConfucius’ concern for future generations was profound,\nSo he showed people the *instruments* while concealing **Dao**,\nMaking those of average or lesser ability adhere to the *instruments*,\nSo they would not be dazzled by **Dao**,\nAnd thus not fail to be gentlemen—\nYet those of average or greater ability\nCould ascend from there on their own.\n\nLaozi was not so—\nHe aimed to clarify **Dao** and urgently sought to open people’s hearts,\nSo he showed people **Dao** while slighting the *instruments*,\nFor he believed that if scholars only knew the *instruments*,\nThen **Dao** would be hidden—\nThus he discarded *virtue* and *righteousness*,\nAbandoned rites and music,\nTo clarify **Dao**.\n\n**Dao** cannot be spoken of—\nAll that can be spoken are its semblances.\nThe enlightened use semblances to discern the true,\nWhile the ignorant cling to semblances and fall into falsehood—\nThus there are those in later ages\nWho cling to Laozi’s words to disrupt the world,\nYet those who follow Confucius have no great faults.\nThose who use Laozi’s words to attain **Dao** are not few,\nYet those who seek **Dao** from Confucius\nOften seem to have no way in.\n\nThese two Sage-Persons,\nBoth acted out of necessity—\nTo preserve one, they must neglect the other.\n\nZhao says:\nCast a stone into the sea,\nIt must reach the bottom or else—\nIf it does not reach the bottom,\nThere is no way to measure the sea’s depth.\nSpeaking of **Dao** must reach the point before things began to exist,\nOr else there is no way to see **Dao**.\n\n**Chapter Twenty: The Extremes of Governance**\nWhen governance is at its peak,\nThe Sage and *wisdom* are discarded;\nWhen it is established,\nThings and affairs are not discarded—\nHow much less the Sage and *wisdom*?\n\n**Chapter Twenty: Discard Learning, No

ceases to learn,\nBut takes **Dao** as his primary focus.\nNot learning does not diminish him,\nNor does excessive learning disrupt him—\nSerene and without worries,\nWhy would he need to discard learning?\n\nGuang remarked:\n*\"The unenlightened scholar* calculates good and evil,\nHoping for practical use—\nThis is the minor use of what is useful.\n*The one who discards learning* knows the unity of life and death,\nEquates gain and loss,\nMoves without attachment—\nYet remains unperturbed—\nThus, no worries—\nThis is the major use of what is truly useless.\n\nZhao remarked:\n*\"To practice learning is called 'hearing' (闻),\nTo discard learning is called 'neighboring' (邻).\nBeyond these two lies true excess.\nThen, beyond discarding learning, there is still higher ground to ascend.\nHow far apart are 'only' (唯) and 'yes' (阿)?\nHow distant are good and evil?\n\nScholars drown in what they hear,\nUnable to unify it—\nThus, 'only' becomes excessive deference,\nAnd 'yes' becomes arrogant presumption,\nFar beyond mere comparison—\nHow much more so the stark contrast of good and evil?\n\nOnly the Sage knows all things share the same *nature*,\nYet arise from illusion.\nLike drawing horses and oxen,\nOr carving tigers and pigs—\nNone reflect their true forms.\nErased, they lose all distinction of right and wrong,\nSame or different—\nWho can measure their separation?\n\nIf one knows this,\nThen all things flourish together without harm,\n**Dao** flows in parallel without contradiction,\nAnd reason finds no cause for astonishment.\n\nWhat people fear,\nOne must not fail to fear.\nThe Sage balances self and others,\nUnifies same and different—\nHis mind clings to nothing,\nYet does he neglect the world’s laws,\nTransgressing boundaries of propriety and reason?\nNo.\n\nWhat people do, I also do.\nWhat people fear, I also fear—\nThough I stand among rulers and subjects,\nParents and children,\nAnd move within the realm of ritual and music,\nGovernance and punishment,\nThe world knows no difference in me.\n\nYet I do not entangle myself in things,\nFor my resolve is already set.\n\nZhenghe remarked:\n*\"The Sage drums all things

      "translated_text": "**Chapter Twenty-One: The Virtue and Manifestation of the Dao**\n\nThe virtue of the Dao follows only from the Dao itself.\nThe Dao is formless—\nYet when it moves, it manifests as virtue,\nAnd thus takes on appearance.\nTherefore, virtue is the visible aspect of the Dao.\n\nExtending this further,\nAll things’ appearances are the Dao manifesting in them.\n\nThe Dao, as a thing,\nIs vague and indistinct.\nVague and indistinct—\nYet within it, there are forms.\nIndistinct and vague—\nYet within it, there are things.\n\nThe Dao is neither being nor non-being,\nThus it is spoken of as vague and indistinct.\nYet when it moves and forms shapes,\nWhen it settles and becomes things,\nNone escape its origin in vagueness and indistinctness.\n\nMysterious and dark—\nYet within it, there is essence.\nAt the juncture of being and non-being,\nVague and indistinct yet unseen,\nWhen being and non-being intermingle,\nIts mystery and darkness become profound and boundless—\nThough not yet formed, its essence abides within.\n\nIts essence is most true,\nAnd within it, there is authenticity.\nWhen things take form,\nTruth and falsity become mixed.\nWhen essence is pure,\nFalsity cannot intrude.\n\nOnce truth and falsity are mixed,\nFrom one it becomes two,\nFrom two it becomes three—\nChaotic and entangled,\nNo longer trustworthy.\n\nWhen essence is pure,\nIt does not deceive me.\n\nFrom ancient times to now,\nIts name does not fade—\nIt observes all transformations.\nThough ancient and modern differ,\nThe Dao does not fade,\nThus it is called *unfading*.\nOnly because it never fades\nCan it observe all transformations.\n\n*Fú* means beauty.\nThough all things are beautiful,\nThey cannot escape change.\nHow do I know all transformations are thus?\nBy this.\n\nThe Sage knows how all things are\nBecause he embodies the Dao and does not depart from it.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Two: Conformity Brings Wholeness**\n\nConformity brings wholeness—\nThe Sage acts only in accordance with principle.\nWhere principle lies,\nIt may be straight or curved,\nBut the key is harmony alone.\nThus, it does not conflict with things,\nAnd so it is whole.\n\nCrookedness becomes straight—\nStraightness without principle is not true straightness.\nThough crookedness follows principle,\nIt is the most straight in the world.\n\nHollow becomes full—\nWhere all gather, it is low.\nThough one may wish to avoid fullness,\nIt cannot be avoided.\n\nExhaustion brings renewal—\nBright and clear is not the Dao.\nMuddled and obscured—\nYet daily renewal arises from this.\n\nFewness brings attainment—\nThe Dao is one.\nAttaining one means attaining all.\nExcess brings confusion—\nMany studies without unity bring confusion.\n\nThus, the Sage holds to *One* as the model for all under heaven.\nHolding to *One* is returning to nature.\nFor conformity brings wholeness,\nCrookedness becomes straight,\nHollow becomes full,\nExhaustion brings renewal,\nFewness brings attainment,\nExcess brings confusion—\nAll are remnants of holding to *One*,\nThus it concludes with *Holding to One*.\n\n**Ye** says:\nConformity brings wholeness, hollow becomes full, necessity brings attainment—these are principle;\nCrookedness becomes straight, exhaustion brings renewal—these are natural forces.\nCrookedness is not sought for straightness,\nYet extreme crookedness must become straight.\nExhaustion is not sought for renewal,\nYet extreme exhaustion must bring renewal.\nPrinciple and force complement each other,\nSometimes forming beginnings and ends,\nSometimes alternating gain and loss—\nChaotic and inexhaustible,\nYet the Sage alone can hold to *One*,\nNot changing with them,\nThus making it the model for all under heaven.\n\nNot self-appearing, thus clear—\nThe eye does not see itself,\nThus it can see things.\nThe mirror does not illuminate itself,\nThus it can illuminate things.\nIf it were to see and illuminate itself,\nIt would have no time for anything else—\nHow could it attend to things?\n\nNot self-asserting, thus manifest—\nNot self-praising, thus功成 (*gōngchéng*—achievement fulfilled);\nNot self-exalting, thus enduring.\nOnly because it does not contend,\nNone under heaven can contend with it.\n\nNot self-appearing, not self-asserting, not self-praising, not self-exalting—\nAll are remnants of non-contention,\nThus it concludes with *non-contention*.\n\nThe ancients spoke of *conformity brings wholeness*—\nWas this empty speech?\nTruly, it is whole and returns to this.\n\nThe world takes straightness as right,\nCurvedness as wrong,\nYet if one follows principle in the world,\nThere will be no avoiding curvedness,\nThus the chapter concludes:\nIs this empty speech?\nTruly, it is whole and returns to this.\n\nWhat is called *whole* is not merely preserving oneself—\nInternally, it preserves oneself;\nExternally, it preserves things.\nPreserving both self and things,\nReturning to nature—\nThen its straightness is great.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Three: Rare Speech and Naturalness**\n\nRare speech, naturalness.\nSpeech arising from naturalness\nIs simple yet precise.\nIf not natural yet forced,\nIt becomes verbose and untrustworthy.\n\nThus it is said:\nWhen the Dao issues from the mouth,\nIts flavor is insipid,\nIts sight is indistinct,\nIts sound is inaudible,\nIts use is inexhaustible—\nThis is called *rare speech*.\n\n**Guang** says:\nRare speech is speech without leaving traces of speech,\nThus speech without ever speaking—\nMerging with the natural Dao, like the sound of a bird’s cry.\n\nA gust of wind does not last the morning,\nA sudden rain does not last the day.\nWho does this?",

yang do not contend,\nThe winds and rains come in due season,\nNeither hasty nor sluggish,\nExpending their force fully before ceasing.\nBut when yang surges upward and yin sinks downward,\nWhen blocked and unable to vent,\nThen come the gusting winds and torrential rains.\nThough they may rage, their force cannot last a day.\nThe sages of old spoke sparingly,\nActed with ease,\nAll following their natural course—\nThus enduring without exhaustion.\n\nThe world may weary of this,\nPreferring deceitful words to please the ear,\nOr startling deeds to dazzle the eye,\nYet they know not why such things cannot last.\n\n**Zheng He** says:\nHeaven and Earth shape the myriad things—\nThe wind scatters them, letting all forms transform naturally,\nThe rain nourishes them, allowing all things to flourish on their own.\nThus they neither over-generate nor over-prompt,\nYet all things thrive between Heaven and Earth—\nThis is why they endure long.\n\nBut gusting winds and sudden rains bring discord to yin and yang,\nAnd if forced, they bring harm—\nThus they cannot last.\nTherefore, those who follow the Dao:\nThose aligned with the Dao gain the Dao;\nThose aligned with virtue gain virtue;\nThose aligned with loss gain loss.\nThose aligned with the Dao obtain the Dao;\nThose aligned with virtue obtain virtue;\nThose aligned with loss obtain loss.\n\nConfucius said:\nIf one’s resolve is in *ren* (benevolence),\nThere is no evil—\nThus it is said: *\"The faults of the virtuous are easily pardoned.\"*\nIf resolve in *ren* is thus,\nHow much more so for those resolved in the Dao?\n\nIf one truly follows the Dao,\nThose who align with it gain the Dao,\nThose who align with virtue gain virtue—\nEven if they err, though they lose in their actions,\nThey must still gain in virtue and Dao.\n\n**Zhao** says:\nThe true aligns with the true,\nThe false aligns with the false—\nIlluminating the obscure, harmonizing the hidden,\nOne with its true nature,\nNeither gain nor loss,\nNeither purity nor defilement,\nEnlightenment and ignorance equal.\nFaith insufficient, doubt arises.\nThose who do not know the Dao\nHave shallow faith in it,\nAnd when they err, they doubt it—\nThus their doubt only grows.\nOnly those who truly know the Dao\nDo not let gain or loss shake their faith.\n\n**Pan** says:\nDescend into *rare speech*,\nAnd one loses the constancy of life and nature—\nInsufficient faith will surely lead to disbelief.\n\n**Zhao** further says:\nThis chapter on the Dao’s subtlety should be understood through **Zhao’s** words,\nYet the text’s flow is disjointed.\nLet me explain:\n*Rare speech and naturalness*—this is the foundation of discussing the Dao.\nOnly when virtue and Dao are lost\nDo *ren*, *yi*, *li*, and *zhi* arise.\nIf one truly follows the Dao,\nWho speaks of gain or loss?\nBut later generations, lacking sincerity,\nDoubt—\nLike gusting winds and sudden rains,\nWhich could never last a day.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Four: The Limping Cannot Stand**\n\nThe limping cannot stand,\nThe striding cannot walk.\nThe self-admiring are blind,\nThe self-righteous are unillustrious,\nThe self-praising achieve nothing,\nThe self-conceited do not endure.\n\nNo one can stand and walk at once—\nIf one deems standing and walking insufficient\nAnd adds striding or limping,\nNone can preserve their standing or walking.\nThe same applies to self-admiration,\nSelf-righteousness,\nSelf-praise,\nAnd self-conceit.\n\n**Zheng He** says:\nTo limp and seek to stand,\nTo stride and seek to walk—\nThis defies nature’s constancy,\nAnd the body’s ease is hard to achieve.\nTo see oneself is to lack wisdom to encompass all things—\nThus one is blind.\nTo insist on being correct is to lack benevolence to unite the many—\nThus one is unillustrious.\nTo possess virtue yet lose it through boasting—\nThus one achieves nothing.\nTo boast of one’s abilities yet lose them through arrogance—\nThus one does not endure.\nIn the Dao, this is called *\"excess food, superfluous actions.\"*\nLike eating and drinking—\nWhen sated, one stops;\nExcess brings illness.\nLike the four limbs—\nWhen complete, they suffice;\nSuperfluity becomes a burden.\nSome may despise this,\nYet those who follow the Dao do not dwell there.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Five: The Indeterminate Oneness**\n\nThere is an indeterminate Oneness,\nBorn before Heaven and Earth.\nThe Dao is neither clear nor turbid,\nNeither high nor low,\nNeither departing nor arriving,\nNeither good nor evil—\nYet it coalesces into form,\nIn humans, this is called *xing* (nature).\nThus it is said: *There is an indeterminate Oneness.*\n\nNone know its origin—\nIt is tranquil, ever-present,\nAnd from it, Heaven and Earth arise.\n\n**Guang** says:\nThe Dao cannot be divided—*indeterminate*.\nNo effort—*coalesces*.\nNo beginning—*born before*.\n\nThe formless form,\nExisting alone before Heaven and Earth.\n\n**Zheng He** says:\nHeaven and Earth also depend on this to arise—\nThus it is said: *Born before Heaven and Earth.*\n\nSilent and vast,\nIndependent yet unchanging,\nCirculating yet unexhausted—\nIt can be the Mother of all beneath Heaven.\n\nSilent, with no sound,\nVast, with no form—\nIndependent, unmatched, yet never varying,\nCirculating among all things, yet never failing—\nDescending to nurture the myriad creatures,\nThus it is their Mother.\n\n**Guang** says:\nDetached from dependence—*independent*.\nTrue and constant—*unchanging*.\n\n**Zheng He** says:\nUntouched by motion,\nUninvolved with things—\nTranquil, and that is all.\nGreat constancy sustains it,\nUnchanging with all things.\n\nSpeaking of the Dao’s essence:\nIts utility flows in and out,\nComing and going without

root,\nThe restless on stillness as its lord.\n\nTherefore, the Sage moves all day without departing from their burdens.\nThough there are palaces and towers of splendor,\nTheir dwelling surpasses them in stillness.\nTo move while light yet not depart from burdens—\nThough palaces bring joy, one must still dwell in stillness,\nFor the necessity of heavy and stillness is thus.\n\nHow can the ruler of a great realm\nLighten themselves against the world?\nIf the ruler lightens their body to bear the world,\nThey will be insufficient to bear the world.\n\nTo lighten is to lose ministers,\nTo be restless is to lose the Sage.\nTo lighten or be restless without remedy is futile—\nYet if the Sage lightens themselves, ministers know they cannot rely on them,\nIf ministers are restless, the Sage knows their minds are set on gain—\nThus it is said: To lighten is to lose ministers,\nTo be restless is to lose the Sage.\n\n**Zhao** says:\nThe ancients called elevated brilliance \"observation.\"\nThe towers and palaces of brilliance—\nThough there are palaces of splendor,\nTheir dwelling surpasses them in stillness—\nThis illustrates stillness, like the Southern Honor (*Nánróng*).\n---\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Seven: The Virtuous Movement Leaves No Trace, The Virtuous Speech Knows No Flaw**\n\nThe virtuous movement leaves no trace—\nMoving in accordance with principle,\nThus leaving no trace.\n**Guang** says:\nMounting with the rear wheels first,\nDriving with spirit-horses—\nThis is without fixed timing,\nThat is without fixed place,\nHow can there be traces?\n\nThe virtuous speech knows no flaw—\nSpeaking only when necessary,\nThus their words fill the world without error.\n**Guang** says:\nThe Perfect One in speech—\nTheir lips murmur, and the response is clear;\nNo attachment to truth or meaning,\nThey speak as if in a dream,\nThey speak and forget their speech—\nHow can there be flaws or censure?\n\nThe virtuous calculation does not rely on tallying tools—\nAll things’ numbers are laid out before them,\nYet they know without calculation—\nHow need they tallying tools?\n**Guang** says:\nEven dust fills the Earth,\nEven drops complete the sea,\nYet to exhaust the Dao and know all things—\nTo know one and thus know ten thousand—\nWhat need for tallying tools?\n\nThe virtuous closure requires no bolt or key to be unopened,\nThe virtuous binding needs no rope or knot to be undone.\nA person of complete virtue—\nToward all things,\nLike a mother to her child,\nThough they let them go, they do not depart—\nThus, no bolt is needed to close,\nNo rope is needed to bind.\n\nTherefore, the Sage always knows how to rescue people—\nThus, they abandon no one;\nAlways knows how to rescue things—\nThus, they discard nothing.\nTo rely on calculations for planning,\nTo set bolts for closure,\nTo hold ropes for binding—\nTheir reach is limited.\n\nThe Sage toward humanity—\nNot only does they tolerate them,\nBut also knows how to rescue them;\nI abandon no one—\nHow can people not return to me?\nThis is called *cloaking brilliance* (*xímíng*).\n\nRescuing people from peril and hardship—\nThis is not the greatest rescue.\nWhen they drift through life and death,\nWhen obscured by things,\nAnd I impart my utmost clarity to them,\nMaking the dark ones bright—\nLike lamps passing on light without ceasing—\nThen this can be called the greatest rescue of people.\n\nThus, the good person is the teacher of the not-good,\nThe not-good person is the resource of the good.\nThe Sage does not cherish their teacher,\nNor does the world love their resource.\nThe Sage does not love their resource—\nBecause they do not cling to teaching;\nThe world does not cherish their teacher—\nBecause they do not cling to learning.\nThe Sage does not merely forget the world,\nBut also makes the world forget them.\n\nThough wisdom is vast and confused,\nThis is called *essential mystery*.\nThe Sage’s mystery—\nEven the wise may not fully comprehend.\n\n**Guang** says:\nWhen sickness persists, medicine remains—\nWhen sickness abates, medicine departs—\nMedicine and sickness both depart—\nHumans follow the twofold forgetting—\nGreat awakening as if in confusion—\nThis is the *essential mystery*.\n\n---\n**Chapter Twenty-Eight: Knowing Its Masculine**\n\nKnow its masculine,\nHold to its feminine,\nTo be a valley for the world.\nTo be a valley for the world,\nTheir constant virtue does not depart—\nReturning to the state of the infant.\nKnow its purity,\nHold to its darkness,\nTo be a model for the world.\nTo be a model for the world,\nTheir constant virtue is unerring—\nReturning to the state of **Supreme Mystery** (*wújí*).\nKnow its glory,\nHold to its shame,\nTo be a basin for the world.\nTo be a basin for the world,\nTheir constant virtue is sufficient—\nReturning to the state of **Simplicity** (*pǔ*).\n\nMasculine and feminine,\nAre the first and last that reach us.\nDarkness and purity,\nAre the bright and dim that reach us.\nGlory and shame,\nAre the noble and base that reach us.\nTo desire the first while hating the last,\nTo desire the bright while hating the dim,\nTo desire the noble while hating the base—\nThis is the nature of things.\nYet the first and last reaching us,\nAre not as pressing as the bright and dim,\nThe bright and dim reaching us,\nAre not as deep as the noble and base.\n\nThe ancient Sages abandoned delusion to seek recovery of their true nature—\nThe clearer their nature,\nThe lower their guard;\nThe lower their guard,\nThe thicker their virtue;\nThe thicker their virtue,\nThe greater their return.»",

they receive it.\n\nTheir governance of the world\nIs not an imposition—\nThey follow the natural course of things,\nRemoving only their harm.\n\nIf one takes and imposes,\nIt cannot be achieved.\n\nThe world is a divine vessel—\nIt cannot be forced.\n\nTo force it brings ruin;\nTo grasp it brings loss.\n\nAll things cannot be forced—\nEven among a hundred people,\nIf they do not follow their nature and act arbitrarily,\nThere will surely be discord and resistance—\nHow much more so the world?\n\nYet small things, few in number,\nMay be taken by force or seized by cunning,\nBut the world, with its divine master,\nIf not allowed to return naturally, will rebel;\nIf not permitted to govern itself, will fall into chaos.\n\nThus things either move or follow,\nEither warm or cool,\nEither strengthen or weaken,\nEither complete or destroy.\n\nTherefore the Sage avoids excess,\nAvoids extravagance,\nAvoids imbalance.\n\nYin and yang surge against each other,\nHigh and low tilt each other,\nGreat and small govern each other.\n\nSome move ahead,\nSome follow behind,\nSome warm with breath,\nSome chill with draft,\nSome nourish and strengthen,\nSome diminish and weaken,\nSome complete and form,\nSome ruin and destroy—\nAll are the natural course of things,\nAn inescapable force.\n\nYet the foolish of the world,\nSelfishly seeking gain,\nWould resist and defy it—\nTheir ruin is either sudden or gradual.\n\nThe Sage, knowing it cannot be reversed,\nFollows and awaits it,\nAvoids excess,\nAvoids extravagance,\nAvoids imbalance,\nSo that nothing oversteps and harms things—\nAnd the world knows no calamity.\nThis is the utmost of *not-forcing*.\n\nThough Yao and Tang could not escape droughts and floods,\nThey never reached ruin—\nThis is why.\n\nThe *I Ching*’s **\"T'ai (泰)\"** says:\n*\"The later sage completes Heaven and Earth’s way,\nAssists and harmonizes their suitability,\nTo govern the people on the left

ruin will surely return—\nKing Ling of Chu, King Mo of Qi, Qin Shi Huang, and Emperor Wu of Han,\nSome perished themselves,\nSome brought ruin to their descendants.\n\nWhat men abhor,\nThe spirits

those who love to kill.\nHe who loves to kill\nCannot prevail in the world.\n\nAuspicious matters honor the left,\nInauspicious matters honor the right.\nThus, the Assistant General takes the left,\nThe Supreme General takes the right,\nAnd is treated with funeral rites.\nWhen many are slain, they are lamented with sorrowful weeping,\nAnd victory is treated with funeral rites.\n\nThe Dao ever nameless—\nThough crude and small,\nThe world dares not submit to it.\nIf lords and kings could guard it,\nAll things would come as guests of their own accord.\n\nCrude—this is their nature.\nThe Dao ever nameless,\nThus their nature too cannot be named.\n\nTherefore, when expanded, it is nowhere absent;\nWhen contracted, it does not fill the slightest space—\nThis is why, though small, it cannot be subdued.\n\nEven the lowliest man, if he guards it,\nMay refine himself with dust and dregs\nTo the stature of Yao and Shun.\nYet lords and kings, though exalted, cannot guard it,\nAnd all things refuse to come as guests.\n\nHeaven and Earth unite,\nDescending sweet dew—\nNo one commands it, yet it is evenly distributed.\nThe pure *qi* ascends and descends,\nUniting as one,\nDescending sweet dew—\nGently covering all things,\nWithout fail or omission.\n\nThe sage embodies the Perfect Way\nTo respond to all things,\nLike sweet dew reaching everywhere—\nThis is how he can make all things come as guests.\n\nWhen names were first established,\nNames having been established,\nOne must also know when to stop—\nKnowing when to stop is how one avoids peril.\n\nThe sage disperses the crude to form instruments,\nUsing instruments to establish names—\nHow could he abandon the crude for names,\nOr pursue the superficial and lose the root?\n\nIndeed, he knows to return to his nature,\nThus he rides through all transformations without peril.\n\nCompare the Dao in the world\nTo valleys and rivers with the sea.\nThe sea is the bell of water;\nValleys and rivers are its branches.\nThe Dao is the origin of all things;\nAll things are its branches.\nAll are water, so valleys and rivers return to their bell;\nAll are Dao, so all things come as guests to their origin.\n\nZhao said: All sayings speak of all things coming as guests to the Dao,\nLike valleys and rivers returning to the sea.\nBing Wen alone differed, saying:\nIf so, it should be said, \"All things come as guests to the Dao,\nLike rivers returning to the sea.\"\nJiang He and Ma Dan doubted the character *with* (与),\nAnd changed it to *rush toward* (赴)—both incorrect.\n\nI privately think this chapter speaks of the Dao originally having no name,\nThen names being established—\nFor the sun, moon, stars, mountains, grasses, and trees.\nThe sage uses them,\nEstablishing officials and titles—\nThough names differ, they are all one Dao.\n\nLike water in the world:\nAs valleys, as rivers, as seas—\nThough forms differ, they are all one water.\nThe scholar must forget names\nAnd return to the nameless crude—\nThus, \"One must also know when to stop\"—\nTo stop at the Dao.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Three: \"Knowing Others is Wisdom\"**\n\nKnowing others is wisdom,\nKnowing oneself is enlightenment.\nDiscrimination is wisdom,\nExhaustive understanding is enlightenment.\nAs long as discrimination remains,\nOne stops at knowing others but cannot know oneself.\nWhen understanding is exhaustive,\nOne knows oneself and can also extend to others.\n\nHe who overcomes others is strong,\nHe who overcomes himself is powerful.\nStrength can reach others but not oneself;\nTo conquer oneself and restore one’s nature—\nThis is beyond the reach of strength,\nThus he may be called powerful.\n\nHe who knows contentment is rich.\nHe who finds sufficiency in what he encounters\nIs never without wealth.\nThough he possess the world,\nIf he dwells there with a heart of perpetual lack,\nHe will never be rich.\n\nThe resolute in action have willpower—\nNot contending with things,\nYet ever striving without ceasing,\nNo one can take away their resolve.\n\nHe who never loses his foundation endures long.\nThings change without constancy,\nYet the heart never strays—\nThis is enduring long.\n\nHe who dies yet does not perish is long-lived.\nThe transformation of life and death is great,\nYet nature remains undiminished—\nThis is how the ancient sages achieved neither life nor death.\n\nShi said:\nTo live without living is endurance;\nTo die without dying is longevity.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Four: \"The Great Dao Flows\"**\n\nThe Great Dao flows—\nIt can be left or right.\nFlowing, it knows neither \"can\" nor \"cannot,\"\nThus left and right, up and down,\nCirculating without bound.\n\nGuang said:\nIts \"can\" is also \"cannot.\"\nThe Great Dao cannot be fixed or demanded,\nCannot be grasped through opposition.\nAll things rely on it to live yet it does not claim them;\nIts deeds accomplished, it does not name itself.\n\nIn the world, there are those who give life yet do not claim it—\nThey will surely name it as their own;\nThere are those who avoid things yet do not possess them—\nThey will surely reject them and fail to sustain life.\nTo give life yet not claim,\nTo accomplish yet not possess—\nOnly the Dao does this.\n\nIt clothes all things yet is not their master,\nThus it ever lacks desire—\nIt may be called *small*.\nAll things return to it yet it is not their master—\nIt may be called *great*.\nThus the sage never claims greatness,\nAnd so achieves true greatness.\nGreat yet without the heart of greatness—\nThen it is small.\n\nZheng He said:\nIt covers all things yet does not display its sovereign power,\nThus it is not their master.\nIt stirs and guides the multitude yet no trace of their return is seen,\nThus it is unknown as their master.\nThe Dao is not one to be named as great or small—\nWhen it is said \"may be called,\" it refers to the Dao’s reach to things.\n\nMencius said:\nTo transform greatly is called sagehood.\nTo transform greatly, then how could there be the burden of greatness?\nThus he achieves true greatness.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Five: \"Holding the Great Image\"**\n\nHolding the Great

      "translated_text": "**Chapter 38: The Virtue of the Highest Virtue Does Not Virtue**\n\nThe highest virtue does not cling to virtue—\nThus it has virtue.\nThe lower virtue clings to virtue—\nThus it lacks virtue.\n\nThe Sage lets his heart’s desires unfold without overstepping bounds,\nNot because he intentionally seeks virtue—\nVirtue arises naturally.\n\nThose of lesser wisdom recognize virtue’s worth\nAnd strive to attain it without loss,\nYet they merely preserve themselves—\nWhat true virtue do they possess?\n\nThe highest virtue acts without action yet achieves without effort.\nThe lower virtue acts and yet still strives for achievement.\nTo act without action yet still strive for achievement—\nThis is still action.\n\nThose of lesser wisdom cannot succeed without effort,\nYet they still strive for achievement—\nNot mere empty action without method.\n\n**Zheng’s Commentary:**\nNot thinking yet attaining,\nNot striving yet hitting the mark,\nNot acting yet arriving—\nThis is the virtue of the highest.\n\nNot thinking yet failing to attain,\nNot striving yet missing the mark,\nNot acting yet failing to arrive—\nThis is the virtue of the lower.\n\nThe highest benevolence acts without striving for achievement,\nThe highest righteousness acts while still striving for achievement.\nBenevolence and righteousness alike do not force their way—\nBenevolence triumphs by not striving for achievement,\nRighteousness succeeds by striving for achievement.\n\nVirtue has high and low,\nYet benevolence and righteousness have only high—no low—\nWhy so?\n\nThe lower virtue lies between benevolence and righteousness,\nAnd those who fall below righteousness—\nNeed not be spoken of further.\n\nThe highest ritual acts yet meets no response,\nSo it rolls up its sleeves and enforces it.\nFrom virtue descending to ritual,\nThis is how the Sage governs the people—\nTo the utmost.\n\nThus, when action meets no response,\nIt rolls up its sleeves and compels it.\nWhen compulsion still meets no response,\nThen punishments arise and arms are raised—\nThis is mere empty action without method.\n\nThus, when the Way is lost, virtue follows,\nWhen virtue is lost, benevolence follows,\nWhen benevolence is lost, righteousness follows,\nWhen righteousness is lost, ritual follows.\nRitual, though thin in loyalty and trust,\nIs the beginning of chaos.\n\nLoyalty and trust without ritual—\nThey remain unseen.\nRitual established, their excellence shines outward.\nBetween ruler and subject, parent and child,\nHusband and wife, friends—\nTheir brilliance is dazzling, yet their substance is empty.\n\nFollow it and order prevails;\nDefy it and chaos ensues.\nThe gap between order and chaos—\nNarrower than a hair’s breadth—\nThus it is called the beginning of chaos.\n\n**Foreknowledge** is the flower of the Way,\nYet the start of folly.\n\nThe Sage gazes deeply into all things,\nJudging right and wrong, gain and loss—\nAll laid out before him,\nLike sunlight revealing form,\nSeeing all without distinction of before or after.\n\nCommon folk see only with their eyes,\nHear only with their ears,\nThink only with their minds,\nLost among all things,\nExhausting their intelligence to perceive—\nThough they call it wisdom,\nThey know not that folly begins with self-assurance.\n\nThus, the noble man abides in substance, not in superficiality,\nIn reality, not in ornament—\nHence he discards the latter for the former.\n\nThe vulgar man delights in what he gains below,\nForgetting what is above—\nThus he rejoices in superficiality and abandons substance.\nWho but the noble man can discard the latter for the former?\n\n**Lu’s Commentary:**\nWhen loyalty and trust weaken within,\nRitual is established to prevent chaos—\nThus ritual is called the beginning of chaos,\nNot that ritual itself is the beginning of chaos.\n\nForeknowledge is the flower of virtue and morality,\nManifesting outwardly, it elevates ritual to guide the foolish—\nNot that wisdom is the start of folly.\n\nBenevolence, righteousness, ritual, and wisdom—\nThese are tools suited to their times.\nTo govern the present by the past,\nOne must root oneself in the substance of virtue and morality.\nTo transform the present and return to the past,\nOne must begin with ritual,\nFlowing downstream to return to the source.\n\n**Zhao’s Commentary:**\nThe Sage’s intent in holding to the past to govern the present\nWas to gradually restore the governance of non-action.\nThus he first expounds on virtue and morality,\nThen confuses benevolence and righteousness,\nAnd finally clarifies ritual and music—\nThis gradual approach inevitably leads to harsh laws and governance,\nA natural consequence of his words.\n\nCommon scholars thus scorn benevolence and righteousness,\nDestroy ritual and law,\nBelieving that without benevolence and righteousness, chaos reigns,\nAnd without ritual and law, how long before all become beasts?\nThis is why the scholars of Jin and Song abandoned themselves,\nUntil their nation fell and they perished without knowing it.\n\nHow could they know the Sage’s true intent\nOr Laozi’s original discussion of ritual?\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 39: The One of Old**\n\nThe One of old—\nHeaven gains the One and thus is clear,\nEarth gains the One and thus is tranquil,\nThe Spirit gains the One and thus is numinous,\nThe Valley gains the One and thus is full,\nAll things gain the One and thus live,\nThe sovereign gains the One and thus governs the world.\n\nThe One—this is the Way.\nAll things exist as they do because of the Way.\n\nPeople of the world see things yet forget the Way—\nHeaven knows only its clarity,\nEarth knows only its tranquility,\nThe Spirit knows only its numinosity,\nThe Valley knows only its fullness,\nAll things know only their living,\nThe sovereign knows only his governance—\nYet they do not know that all this comes from the Way.\n\nIf Heaven loses the One, it nearly shatters,\nIf Earth loses the One, it nearly erupts,\nIf the Spirit loses the One, it nearly fades,\nIf the Valley loses the One, it nearly drains,\nIf all things lose

Stillness**\nWhen nature is restored, stillness ensues.\nYet though it remains motionless and tranquil,\nWhen stirred, it flows through all things—\nThis is where movement originates.\n\nFuxi said: *\"Return to the root, and stillness arises; stillness alone can move.\"*\n\nThe Dao’s use lies in its weakness.\nFormless, soundless, the Dao is the weakest of all things beneath heaven—\nYet nothing surpasses its strength.\nThis is how it governs all things.\n\nAll things arise from *having*, yet *having* arises from *non-being*.\nThe world fails to grasp stillness as movement,\nOr weakness as strength—\nThus I speak of their origin.\n\nFor all things beneath heaven,\nThere is the known principle of mother governing child,\nYet never the child governing mother.\n\n**The Noble Hear the Dao**\nThe superior hear the Dao and diligently practice it;\nThe mediocre hear the Dao and cling to it uncertainly;\nThe lowly hear the Dao and laugh at it—\nIf they do not laugh, it is not the Dao.\n\nThe Dao is neither form nor visible,\nNeither sound nor audible.\nIt precedes all things, vast and unobstructed,\nYet its clarity is doubted.\nThus the lowly scorn it as absurd and laugh;\nThe mediocre doubt it, clinging to it as if it might vanish;\nOnly those who see it clearly\nDiligently practice and embrace it without weariness.\n\nConfucius said: *\"When I speak to him, he does not lose my meaning—*\nThis is Zilu.\"\nHow like the superior!\n\nThe *Record of Established Speech* says:\n*\"Establish\"* means to found.\nThe ancients established such speech,\nAnd Laozi took it—\nThis is what the lowly expounds.\n\n**The Manifestation of the Dao**\nThe Dao is bright yet seems obscure—\nIt illuminates all without scrutiny.\nAdvancing the Dao seems like retreat—\nThough it does not move, nothing outpaces it.\nLeveling the Dao seems like unevenness—\nYet where it reaches, all is even, yet nothing is worn down.\nThe highest virtue is like a valley—\nThe highest virtue does not cling to virtue,\nLike the emptiness of a valley.\nGreat whiteness seems like shame—\nTo be white yet unsoiled is the pride of the unwashed,\nNot the saint.\nBroad virtue seems insufficient—\nWhen virtue is boundless and cannot be exceeded,\nIt stops there—this is not broadness.\nEstablishing virtue seems like laziness—\nFollowing nature’s spontaneity without contrivance,\nExternally appearing slack yet truly established.\nTrue substance seems corrupted—\nEmbodying nature and embracing spirit,\nAdapting to all things without losing its essence,\nExternally appearing flawed.\n\nThe *Politics of Harmony* says:\n*\"Not rigid—yet when polished, it does not splinter;\nNot white—yet when stained, it does not darken.*\nThe greatest square has no corners—\nPreserving its vastness, it does not cling to sharp edges.\nGreat vessels take long to form—\nTheir magnitude renders them unusable early.\nGreat music is rare in sound—\nBeyond what the ear can hear.\nGreat forms are shapeless—\nBeyond what the eye can see.\nThe Dao is hidden, nameless.\n\nOnly the Dao\nIs generous and fulfills.\nWherever the Dao meets, it is seen—\nThese twelve are its manifestations in affairs.\nYet the Dao’s completeness remains hidden in its namelessness.\nIt meets where needed, extends its abundance,\nLends where lacking—\nThus all things rely on it to complete.\n\n**Dao/Way Generates the One**\nThe Dao generates the One,\nThe One generates the Two,\nThe Two generates the Three,\nThe Three generates all things.\n\nAll things carry *yin* within *yang*,\nAnd harmonize through *chong-qi* (interpenetrating breath).\nThe Dao is neither One nor Two—\nWhen it pairs with things, the Dao is One while things are not.\nThus it is called the One, yet the Dao is not One.\n\nOne with One makes Two,\nTwo with One makes Three—\nFrom here onward, all things arise.\nThough myriad in difference,\nAll carry *yin* within *yang*,\nAnd harmonize through *chong-qi*—\nFor things arise from Three,\nAnd Three from One—\nThis is the natural order.\n\nPang said:\n*\"One is the Supreme Ultimate,\nTwo is *yin-yang*,\nThree is *chong-qi*.\"*\n\nWhat the world despises—\nThe solitary, the orphaned, the destitute—\nYet kings and lords adopt these titles.\nThe world does not know the origin of all things,\nValuing the few and small while honoring the many and great.\nYet the ancient sages knew—\nThus things may be diminished yet benefit,\nOr benefited yet diminished.\n\nWhat the world teaches,\nI also teach.\nThe overbearing do not meet a good end—\nI shall make this my lesson.\n\nThe world takes weakness as loss,\nStrength as gain—\nYet they are mistaken.\nThus I teach all beneath heaven:\n*\"Have you not seen the overbearing meet their end?\"*\nThe overbearing are the extreme of arrogance.\n\nWhen the world knows the overbearing do not escape death,\nThey will know arrogance cannot be sustained—\nThen I can speak of the Dao.\n\n**The Supreme Weakness**\nThe supreme weakness\nGallops over the supreme strength.\nNothing enters where there is no gap—\nThus I know the benefit of *wuwei* (non-action).\n\nThe teaching of the unsaid,\nThe benefit of *wuwei*—\nFew beneath heaven attain them.\n\nWith strength to counter strength,\nIt does not bend but shatters;\nWith weakness to counter strength,\nNeither weakens nor harms the strong.\nLook to water—\nThis is how.\n\nWith *having* entering *having*,\nThey repel each other;\nWith *non-being* entering *having*,\nThe *non-being* is never weary,\nThe *having* never aware.\nLook to ghosts and spirits—\nThus the sage alone can practice *wuwei*,\nAnd thus master all strength,\nEnter all *having*—\nHence the teaching of the unsaid,\nThe benefit of *wuwei*—\nFew beneath heaven attain them.\n\n**Name and Body**\nWhich is closer: name or body?\nWhich is more: body or wealth?\nTo value name above body,\nTo honor body above wealth—\nThis is still not forgetting oneself.",

forget the self.\nThus he makes all beneath heaven know\nThat name is not what should be cherished,\nThat wealth is not what should be prized—\nOnly then does one know to value the body,\nAnd only then does one know to forget the self.\nThis is the intent of Laozi.\n\nWhich is more harmful: gain or loss?\nHe who has not lost yet suffers loss as disease,\nBut when he has gained and fears losing it,\nHis suffering exceeds that of loss itself.\nOnly by balancing gain and loss,\nBy equalizing possession and deprivation,\nDoes one escape disease.\n\nThus excessive love brings great expenditure,\nExcessive hoarding brings great loss.\nThe more one loves, the more one will do to obtain it—\nHow can one avoid depletion?\nThe more one hoards, the more will seek to take it—\nHow can one avoid loss?\nKnowing sufficiency brings no disgrace,\nKnowing when to stop brings no peril—\nThus one may endure.\n\n**Chapter 45: Great Fullness as Deficiency**\nGreat fullness seems deficient,\nYet its use is unexhausted;\nGreat abundance seems empty,\nYet its use is inexhaustible.\nBeneath heaven, they call non-deficiency \"fullness,\"\nYet fullness must eventually decay;\nThey call non-emptiness \"abundance,\"\nYet abundance must eventually fail.\nThe sage seeks great fullness yet does not fear deficiency,\nAims at great abundance yet does not despise emptiness—\nThus he is full yet does not decay,\nAbundant yet does not fail.\n\nGreat straightness seems crooked,\nGreat skill seems clumsy,\nGreat eloquence seems inarticulate.\nStraight yet not crooked, it will surely break;\nFollow the Way and act, though crooked, it remains straight.\nSkillful yet not clumsy, it will surely weary;\nLet things take their natural course, though clumsy, it is skillful.\nEloquent yet not inarticulate, it will surely exhaust itself;\nSpeak according to the Way, though inarticulate, it is eloquent.\n\nAgitation overcomes cold,\nStillness overcomes heat,\nYet clarity and stillness are the true norm for all beneath heaven.\n\nTo be full yet not deficient,\nAbundant yet not empty,\nStraight yet not rigid,\nSkillful yet not cunning,\nEloquent yet not verbose—\nThis is like agitation unable to be still,\nOr stillness unable to agitate.\n\nAgitation can overcome cold but not heat,\nStillness can overcome heat but not cold—\nBoth are trapped in one extreme and not the true norm.\nOnly the serene and clear, untouched by any one thing,\nNeither full nor deficient,\nNeither abundant nor empty,\nNeither straight nor crooked,\nNeither skillful nor clumsy,\nNeither eloquent nor inarticulate—\nOnly then can one overcome all,\nAnd thus stand as the true norm for all beneath heaven.\n\n**Leaf’s Commentary:**\nCold and heat are the *qi* of heaven and earth.\nIf one here can overcome cold through agitation,\nAnd heat through stillness,\nThen knowing what one overcomes,\nWhat cannot be mastered?\nThus clarity overcomes turbidity,\nStillness overcomes movement—\nTheir effects are already evident.\nHow much more so\nDeficiency overcoming fullness,\nEmptiness overcoming abundance,\nCrookedness overcoming straightness,\nClumsiness overcoming skill,\nInarticulateness overcoming eloquence?\nYet because they do not perceive this,\nThey must seek what can overcome—\nIf they seek to overcome, it will never be the true norm.\nOnly clarity and stillness are the true norm for all beneath heaven.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 46: The Way in the World**\nWhen the Way prevails beneath heaven,\nWarhorses are turned to plowing fields;\nWhen the Way is lost beneath heaven,\nWarhorses breed in the suburbs.\n\nWhen all beneath heaven follow their proper place,\nThere is no contention, yet all is self-governed—\nThus warhorses are turned to plowing fields.\nWhen the Way is lost beneath heaven,\nWarhorses breed in the suburbs.\n\n**Governance by Harmony:**\nTo rule beneath heaven with the Way,\nThe people take joy in their labors,\nAnd there is no contention—\nOnly tilling the fields remains.\n\nNo guilt is greater than desiring what is forbidden,\nNo calamity is greater than not knowing sufficiency,\nNo blame is greater than demanding possession.\nTo show others what they may desire\nIs already guilt enough,\nBut those who do not know sufficiency\nSuffer even greater calamity,\nAnd those who demand possession\nBear the greatest blame.\n\nEven a common man, if he harbors one of these,\nWill suffer their consequences;\nA sovereign who does so\nWill surely see warhorses arise.\n\n**Lu’s Commentary:**\nThe ruler without the Way poisons all beneath heaven,\nAnd his evils are threefold:\nTo see what is desirable yet seek it without reason—\nThis guilt is the greatest.\nTo seek without ceasing—\nThis brings harm to many—\nThis calamity is the greatest.\nTo desire without fulfillment—\nThis stokes the heart further—\nThis blame is the greatest.\n\nThus, true sufficiency is always sufficient.\nTo know sufficiency in what one encounters—\nThen there is no insufficiency.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 47: Not Leaving the Door**\nWithout leaving the door, one knows all beneath heaven;\nWithout peering through the window, one sees the Way of heaven.\nThe farther one goes, the less one knows.\n\nThe *xing* as essence\nFills the universe entirely,\nWith no difference in near or far, ancient or modern.\n\nThe sages of old knew all without leaving door or window—\nOnly because their *xing* was whole.\n\nMen of the world are obscured by things,\nTheir *xing* divided by ears and eyes,\nWithin, confused by body and mind,\nWithout, blocked by mountains and rivers—\nTheir sight does not extend beyond vision,\nTheir hearing does not extend beyond listening,\nAnd even the smallest opening can obscure and cut them off.\n\nThey do not know that the sage restores *xing* and finds sufficiency,\nYet they still seek by going out—\nThus the farther they go, the less they know.\n\nObserve the body to know the body,\nUse the inner to know the outer,\nBegin with the small to know the great,\nClarify the near to understand the far.\nThus the sage acts without moving yet knows,\nSees without looking yet names,\nAccomplishes without doing.\n\nWhat *xing* reaches is not merely knowing and naming—\nIt can also follow things in their natural course,\nAchieving without effort.\n\n**Light’s Commentary:**\nEmotion seals—then stagnation;\nReason aligns—then divinity.\n\n**Lu’s Commentary:**\nWhen the sage eats, he thinks of the world’s hunger;\nWhen he dresses, he thinks of the world’s cold;\nHis love for his parents extends to the world’s elderly;\nHis love for his children extends to the world’s young—\nHe need not leave the door to know all beneath heaven.\n\nIf one loves life,\nHe knows the Way of heaven’s nurturing all things;\nIf one attends to affairs,\nHe knows the Way of heaven’s completing the four seasons;\nIf one delights in goodness,\nHe knows the Way of heaven’s favoring the virtuous—\nWhy

without contrivance,\nSo there are no affairs—\nHis mind manifests externally, yet things are at ease.\nThough he does not take the world,\nThe world returns to him.\n\n**Chapter 49: The Sage Has No Fixed Mind**\nThe sage has no fixed mind,\nTaking the people’s mind as his own.\nTo the virtuous, he is virtuous;\nTo the unvirtuous, he is also virtuous—\nTo the trustworthy, he is trustworthy;\nTo the untrustworthy, he is also trustworthy—\nVirtue and trust.\n\nEmpty and formless,\nYet taking the forms of all things as its forms—\nSquare when in the square,\nRound when in the round.\nIf the void itself had form,\nHow could it shape all things?\n\nThus the sage has no mind,\nTaking the people’s minds as his own—\nTo the virtuous and unvirtuous alike, he is virtuous;\nTo the trustworthy and untrustworthy alike, he is trustworthy.\nVirtue and trust lie in others,\nYet my way of being virtuous and trustworthy\nNever wavers—\nThis is called virtuous virtue.\nTrust and distrust lie in others,\nYet my way of being trustworthy\nNever changes—\nThis is called virtuous trust.\n\nOtherwise, favoring the virtuous while abandoning the unvirtuous,\nTrusting the trustworthy while abandoning the untrustworthy—\nHow could this be called\n*\"constant virtue saving all\"*?\nThus, no one is abandoned.\n\nThe sage in the world,\nDull and indistinct for the world,\nBlending his mind—\nThe people fix their ears and eyes upon him,\nYet the sage treats them like infants.\n\nThe world’s good and evil, truth and falsehood,\nEach clings to its own correctness,\nMutually condemning and harming,\nUncertain where to settle—\nThe sage worries for them,\nThus dull and indistinct, blending their minds—\nNo good, no evil,\nNo truth, no falsehood—\nHe meets all with unity.\n\nThey fix their ears and eyes,\nObserving the sage’s rewards and punishments,\nYet I meet them with the simplicity of an infant—\nNeither delighting in the good,\nNor resenting the evil—\nThus the virtuous do not grow arrogant,\nAnd the wicked do not grow angry,\nAll relax and transform,\nAnd the world begins to settle.\n\n**Leaf’s Commentary:**\nThe sage in the world\nExists yet does not govern.\n\n**Chapter 50: Birth and Death**\nBirth and death—\nNature knows neither.\nEmerging, it becomes birth;\nRetreating, it becomes death.\n\nThirteen are the companions of life,\nThirteen the companions of death,\nAnd thirteen the ways men move toward death’s ground.\n\nThose who use things to refine and nourish themselves\nAre companions of life.\nThose who indulge in sounds, colors, smells, and tastes\nAre companions of death.\n\nThese two distinguish the paths of life and death—\nYet I know action yet do not know rest,\nKnow speech yet do not know silence,\nKnow thought yet do not know forgetting—\nStriving toward exhaustion,\nThis is called moving toward death’s ground.\n\nThe paths of life and death in ten words:\nEach occupies three—\nIs it not that nine belong to life and death,\nAnd one to neither?\n\nNeither life nor death—\nThis is what the *Yijing* calls *\"still and unmoving.\"*\n\nLaozi speaks of the nine,\nYet omits the one,\nLetting men find it themselves,\nAnd entrusting the subtlety of *wuwei* and *wuwu*.\n\n**Zhenghe’s Commentary:**\nThose who associate with life and death\nAre bound to blame life while opposing reason,\nOr forget life while pursuing gain.\n\nWhen men’s lives are moved toward death’s ground,\nTheir life and death—what choice is there?\nWhy?\nBecause their attachment to life is deep.\n\nLife brings death,\nThus companions of life are companions of death.\nThe more men rely on life,\nThe more death’s path dominates—\nNineteen times out of twenty.\n\nIt is said that those skilled in preserving life\nWalk on land without encountering rhinos or tigers,\nEnter armies without bearing arms.\nRhinos have no place to thrust their horns,\nTigers no place to strike with claws,\nWeapons no place to lodge their blades.\nWhy?\nBecause they lack death’s ground.\n\nThe Perfect Man dwells always in neither life nor death—\nIf life’s ground is absent,\nHow could death’s ground exist?\n\n**Chapter 51: The Way Gives Birth**\nThe Way gives birth,\nVirtue nurtures,\nThings shape it,\nCircumstances complete it.\n\nThe Way is the mother of all things,\nThus the giver of birth is the Way.\nWhen it moves, it becomes virtue,\nTending the multitude without complaint,\nThus the nurturer of all things is virtue.\n\nYet virtue and the Way cannot shape themselves—\nThey manifest through things.\nThings cannot complete themselves—\nFar and near interact,\nHard and soft intermingle,\nAccumulating into circumstances,\nAnd the changes of rise and fall, order and chaos are realized.",

one attain *early service*—\n*Early service* is called *accumulating virtue/power* in depth.\nTo accumulate virtue/power deeply\nIs to achieve what cannot be overcome;\nWhat cannot be overcome\nIs to know no limits—\nAnd knowing no limits,\nOne can establish a state.\nThe foundation of establishing a state,\nThis is what endures long.\n\nAll things:\nSquare yet they are cut,\nHonest yet they are pierced, #1\nStraight yet they overreach,\nBright yet they dazzle.\nYet the sage is square yet does not cut,\nHonest yet does not pierce,\nStraight yet does not overreach,\nBright yet does not dazzle—\nThis is what is called *frugality*.\nFor *frugality* means\nHaving yet not employing.\n\nThe world’s affliction lies in its inability to subdue others,\nYet if one truly possesses *frugality* and practices it,\nThough never competing with others,\nOthers recognize they cannot overcome you—\nThen your subjugation comes early.\nOnce others are subdued,\nYou gather and conceal your strength,\nUntil even when your life ends,\nYou never reveal your full capacity—\nThen virtue/power is deeply accumulated.\nWhen virtue/power is thickly accumulated,\nEven the world’s strongest cannot overcome you—\nThen none can fathom or measure you.\nOnly then can you establish a state.\n\nYet the petty men of the world,\nWith even a handspan of power,\nUse it lightly—\nOnce they test and fail to subdue,\nThe world measures their depth and contests them,\nThough they wish to preserve their state,\nThey cannot.\n\nThus I know that *frugality* can establish a state—\nThis is the foundation of establishing a state.\nThis is called *deep-rooted and firm-belted*,\nThe Dao/Way of *long life and enduring vision*.\n\nMencius said:\nTo exhaust one’s heart,\nTo nurture one’s nature—\nThis is how one serves Heaven.\n\nTo govern people with *frugality*\nIs how one can establish a state.\nTo serve Heaven with *frugality*\nIs how one attains deep-rooted firmness.\n\nThe ancient sages preserved their nature and life’s constancy,\nNot wasting externally or internally—\nThen their roots are deep and cannot be uprooted,\nTheir stems are firm and cannot be torn away—\nThus even *long life and enduring vision* are attainable.\n\nThough governing people and serving Heaven\nMay differ in internal and external,\nYet their harmony is one.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 60: *Governing Great States***\n\nTo govern a great state,\nAs one poaches a small fish.\nPoaching a small fish,\nOne must not disturb it—\nGoverning a great state,\nOne must not weary the people.\nTo weary them is to exhaust them;\nTo disturb them is to ruin the fish.\nTo rule the world with the Dao/Way,\nIts spirits are not numinous.\n\nThe sage acts without action,\nLetting people follow their natural course—\nExternally seeking nothing,\nInternally fearing nothing—\nThen none can invade them,\nEven the spirits have no power to harm.\n\n**Lu’s Commentary:**\nWhen the sage rules the world with the Dao/Way,\nThe harmony of Heaven and Earth responds—\nCold and heat alternate,\nLife and transformation unfold—\nAt such times, the spirits have no mystic response—\nWhat numinous power could there be?\nIt is not that the spirits are not numinous,\nBut their numinousness does not harm.\nIt is not that their numinousness does not harm,\nNor does the sage harm.\nIt is not that the spirits’ numinousness does not harm,\nBut the sage never harms—\nThus the spirits have no power to act.\n\n**Ye’s Commentary:**\nThe sage does not harm—\nExamining the following passage on *virtue’s reciprocal return*,\nIt is people who become numinous.\nFor when neither harms the other,\nVirtue reciprocally returns.\nThat people and spirits do not harm each other\nIs because there is a sage above—\nThus virtue reciprocally returns.\nPeople return virtue to the spirits,\nAnd also return virtue to the sage.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 61: *Great States as the World’s Flow***\n\nGreat states are the world’s flow—\nThe world’s convergence upon great states,\nLike waters rushing to the lowlands.\nThe world’s exchange,\nThe world’s *yin*—\n*Yin* always overcomes *yang* through stillness,\nAnd stillness is the lowly.\nAll movement rushes to stillness,\nJust as all heights rush to the lowlands.\nThus great states, by descending to small states,\nTake them;\nSmall states, by descending to great states,\nAre taken by them.\nGreat states, by descending, take others;\nSmall states, by descending, are taken by others.\nSpeaking of the great descending,\nIt seems they should not descend to take others—\nYet they do.\nSpeaking of the small descending,\nThey cannot but descend to be taken by others.\nGreat states seek only to nurture others;\nSmall states seek only to serve others—\nBoth attain what they desire,\nThus the great should descend.\n\n**Harmonious Governance Commentary:**\nHeaven’s Dao descends to nourish and shines brightly,\nThus nothing is left uncovered;\nEarth’s Dao is low yet ascends,\nThus it can support Heaven.\nHumans follow Earth,\nEarth follows Heaven—\nThus the great should descend.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 62: *The Dao/Way as the Essence of All Things***\n\nThe Dao/Way is the essence of all things,\nA treasure of the virtuous,\nA refuge of the unvirtuous.\nBeautiful speech can be traded,\nNoble conduct can elevate others.\nWhat is the harm in a person’s flaws?\nAll that appears externally\nAre but their thresholds and halls.\nThe Dao/Way in things\nIs like their essence—\nAll things possess it,\nYet none see it.\n\nOnly the worthy attain and hold it,\nThus it is called the treasure of the virtuous.\nThe foolish, though unable to possess it,\nYet without the Dao/Way they cannot rest—\nThus it is called the refuge of the unvirtuous.\nThe Dao/Way does not distance itself from people,\nYet people distance themselves from it.\nIf one truly speaks beautifully,\nIt can be traded in the world;\nIf one practices noble conduct,\nIt can elevate others.\nThough in the morning one acts unjustly,\nAnd in the evening hears the Dao/Way,\nExhausting all falsehoods,\nOne’s nature returns—\nEven if one seeks to point out their flaws,\nThey cannot be found—\nAnd how could they be abandoned?\n\nThus establishing a sovereign,\nAppointing the Three Ministers,\nEven with a jade tablet and four horses ahead,\nIt is not as good as sitting and presenting this Dao/Way.\nEstablishing a sovereign,\nAppointing the Three Ministers,\nIs to save people with this Dao/Way.\nThough jade tablets are precious,\nAnd four horses are fine,\nPresenting them is not as beneficial\nAs sitting and presenting this Dao/Way.",

      "translated_text": "The ancient reason why this Dao/Way was held in high esteem was not because it could be sought to obtain, or used to escape blame? Therefore, it is held in high esteem by all under Heaven.\n\nThe Dao/Way originates within oneself; people’s misfortune lies in not seeking it. If one seeks, one will obtain it. The Dao/Way has no merit or guilt; people’s misfortune lies in not knowing it. If one knows it, one will have no guilt and cannot be stained by it.\n\n**Chapter 63: The Chapter on Non-Action**\nTo act without acting,\nTo manage without managing,\nTo savor without savoring—\nGreat or small, much or little,\nRepaying grudges with virtue.\n\nThe Sage acts without acting, yet nothing is left undone;\nManages without managing, yet nothing is left unattended;\nSavors without savoring, yet nothing is left unsavored.\nToward greatness or smallness, muchness or littleness,\nOne simply meets them all with the Dao/Way.\n\nWhat people never forget is resentment.\nYet when their love and hatred fade,\nEven repaying resentment is done with virtue—\nThen one knows how to apply virtue without restraint.\n\nDifficult things must be addressed when they are easy;\nGreat things must be undertaken when they are small.\nThe most difficult tasks under Heaven\nMust begin when they are easy;\nThe greatest undertakings under Heaven\nMust begin when they are small.\nThus the Sage never strives for greatness,\nAnd so achieves true greatness.\n\nLight promises lead to few fulfilled words,\nMany easy things lead to many difficulties.\nThus the Sage treats even the difficult with caution,\nAnd so remains free of difficulty.\n\nPeople fear the great and scorn the small,\nDread the many and seek the few.\nWhen they wait until things are difficult before acting,\nOr until things are great before undertaking them,\nTheir affairs are doomed to fail.\n\nThe Sage equalizes great and small,\nUnifies much and little,\nHolds nothing in fear,\nSees nothing as difficult—\nAnd how could their affairs fail?\n\n**Chapter 64: The Chapter on Ease in Holding**\nWhat is settled and easy to hold,\nBefore its signs appear, is easy to plan;\nWhat is fragile is easy to break,\nWhat is subtle is easy to disperse.\nAct before it exists,\nOrder before it is disordered.\nWhen it has not yet arisen,\nHold and plan for it—\nThat is sufficient.\nWhen it is about to manifest,\nOnly by dispersing it before it forms can it be removed—\nYet even then, it is better than when already formed.\n\nThus, acting before it exists is supreme;\nOrdering before it is disordered is secondary.\n\nA tree as thick as one’s embrace\nGrows from a tiny sprout;\nA nine-tiered tower\nRises from a single clod of earth;\nA thousand-li journey\nBegins with a single step.\n\nThe doer brings about failure,\nThe grasper loses hold.\nThus the Sage, with no action, knows no failure;\nWith no grasping, knows no loss.\n\nThe coming of chaos and blessing,\nAll arise from these three things accumulating the small to form the great.\nThe Sage awaits them with non-action,\nGuards them with non-grasping,\nThus allowing blessing to arise spontaneously,\nAnd calamity to vanish on its own.\n\nIt is like planting seeds—\nDeeply plowed and sown thickly,\nBy autumn, the harvest comes naturally.\nIt is like being robbed—\nSitting calmly and observing attentively,\nThe thief will retreat on his own.\n\nPeople do not understand the natural workings of things,\nBelieving nothing is accomplished without doing,\nNothing retained without grasping—\nThus they constantly contend with calamity,\nAnd obstruct the growth of blessing,\nSo that when calamity arrives, it cannot be averted,\nAnd when blessing comes, it cannot be completed—\nSuch is their inherent nature.\n\nThe people’s undertakings\nOften fail just as they near completion.\nIf one is as careful at the end as at the beginning,\nThere will be no failure.\n\nThe Sage knows the harm of artificial action,\nDoes not aid Heaven with human effort,\nFrom beginning to end follows what is natural—\nThus nothing remains unaccomplished.\n\nPeople’s minds dwell on gain and loss,\nYet in the minutiae of all things,\nThere are still those who do not interfere\nAnd let nature take its course.\nWhen they see things nearly complete\nAnd then recklessly disrupt them,\nThere is none who does not bring about their own ruin.\nThus it is said:\n*Be as careful at the end as at the beginning,*\nAnd there will be no failure.\n\nThus the Sage desires without desiring,\nDoes not prize difficult-to-obtain goods;\nLearns without learning,\nReturns to what others have already surpassed.\nTo assist the natural unfolding of all things,\nYet does not dare to act.\n\nPeople all follow their desires to harm things,\nTrust their learning to harm principle.\nThe Sage is not without desire—\nDesiring yet not desiring,\nThus though desiring, they do not harm things.\nNot without learning—\nLearning yet not

retreats\nIs he who has no intent to contend.\n\nThis is called *action without action*,\nWithout intent to contend,\nEven if arms are used or not,\nThe outcome remains the same. #4\n\nNot contending with others,\nIs akin to *action without action*.\nTo repel without force,\nYet still have no adversary,\nTo grasp without arms.\n\nIf there is no intent to contend,\nThen even amid military

announce the crime with drums and bells,\nAnd halt at the border.\nIf the enemy submits,\nThen the matter is resolved—\nNo need to advance further.\n\nThus, advancing by an inch\nIs often met with few gains,\nWhile retreating by a foot\nIs often met with many gains.\n\nThis, though it appears as *action*,\nIs truly *action without action*; #5\nThough it seems to repel,\nThere is no force to repel;\nThough it appears to confront an enemy,\nThere is no adversary to rely upon;\nThough it seems to wield arms,\nThere are no arms to hold.\n\nNo calamity is greater than underestimating the enemy,\nFor underestimating the enemy\nLeads to reckless warfare,\nAnd reckless warfare\nLeads to careless killing—\nThus losing the basis of compassion.\n\nTherefore, when opposing armies clash,\nThe compassionate shall prevail.\nWhen two enemies confront and I am compelled to act,\nThen I possess compassion.\nWhen compassion is evident,\nHeaven and humanity aid me—\nEven if I wish not to

repose.\n\nThe Sage points to this\nAnd shows it to the people—\nIs it not easy to know?\n\nIf one embodies this\nTo respond to the world—\nIs it not easy to practice?\n\nYet the world’s common affliction\nIs that they use it without knowing,\nAnd even knowing,\nThey cannot practice it—\nMuch less can they embody it!\n\nWords have a *principle*,\nAffairs have a *master*.\nOnly the unknowing\nIs why none know me.\n\nWords are the *Dao’s* snare,\nAffairs are the *Dao’s* traces.\nIf the *Dao* could be fully expressed in words,\nThen listening to words would suffice;\nIf it could be fully seen in affairs,\nThen examining affairs would suffice.\n\nYet words cannot exhaust it,\nAffairs cannot reveal it—\nOnly by abandoning words to seek their *principle*,\nAnd discarding affairs to seek their *master*,\nCan one attain them.\n\nTruly, the ancient Sages\nHad no scheming, no doing,\nYet there remained a *spontaneous* and unselfconscious presence—\nThis lies beyond the reach of thought and calculation,\nThus none ever truly know me.\n\nFew know me,\nThus those who follow me are precious.\nWhat the common people can know\nIs not worthy of esteem.\n\nTherefore, the Sage wears

knowing.\n\nThe unknowing is not like the unknowing of wood or stone.\nThe *Dao* cannot be grasped by mere knowledge,\nNor extinguished by sensory perception,\nNor measured by emotional judgment.\n\nThe *Dao* is not obscure or void,\nYet it enters through obscurity and voidness—\nThis is not something the world can comprehend.\n\nThough the world does not know it,\nOnly those who

knowing is knowing as a disease.\n\nThe *Dao* lies beyond thought and calculation,\nThus it cannot be known.\n\nYet before one knows it,\nThere is no way to enter without knowing;\nAnd once one knows it and clings to that knowing,\nThen it becomes a disease.\n\nThus, knowing while not knowing above—\nNot knowing while knowing as a disease.\n\nGuang said:\nThe *Dao* does not belong to knowing,\nNor does it belong to not knowing.\nKnowing is false perception,\nNot knowing is without strategy—\nYet when one understands the *Dao* and acts as if he does not know,\nThen he preserves the truth of the *Dao* forever,\nAnd this knowing is indeed praiseworthy.\n\nBefore one’s understanding of the *Dao*,\nHe stands in non-knowing;\nWhen he probes and forces knowing,\nThen he falls ill.\nLu said:\nThe nature of the *Dao*\nIs one who does not know yet can know.\n\nTo know that one does not know,\nAnd yet to know it with not knowing—\nThis is the ultimate knowing.\nThough one knows that he does not

knowing,\nThus though he establishes knowing,\nHe is not afflicted by it.\n\nLu said:\nOnly by recognizing knowing as a disease\nAnd treating it as such,\nDoes one return to non-knowing,\nAnd knowing

slaughtered and exterminated—nine out of every ten households—\nwere indeed slain by Heaven.\nHow can those who do evil escape fear?\n\n**Chapter 75: The People’s Hunger**\nThe people starve because their rulers exact too much in taxes.\nThe people are hard to govern because their rulers meddle too much.\nMen grow reckless with death because they cling too desperately to life.\nWhen rulers lead with their own schemes, the people respond in kind—\nthus, many affairs arise and governance becomes difficult.\nWhen rulers prioritize their own desires over the people,\nthe people compete to enrich their own lives—\nso even in death, they will not abandon their pursuit of gain.\n\nOnly those who do not make life their concern\nare wiser than those who revere it.\nTo revere life is to reach the utmost secrecy.\nOnly those who do not make life their concern\npreserve their lives naturally.\n\n*Avowal by Zhao:*\nThis chapter all speaks of how—\nonly those who do not seek to enrich life\ncan make death seem light.\nWhy then do they revere life?\n\n**Chapter 76: The People’s Birth and Death**\nWhen the people are born, they are soft and weak;\nwhen they die, they become firm and strong.\nGrass and trees, when born, are tender and brittle;\nwhen they die, they wither and decay.\nThus, the firm and strong belong to death,\nwhile the soft and weak belong to life.\nWhen *qi* flows freely within, the body knows no rigidity.\nWhen the ultimate principle prevails, affairs bear no burdensome strength.\n\nThus, armies that are strong do not conquer—\narmies conquer through righteousness, not through strength.\nStrength without righteousness meets swift defeat.\nTrees that are too strong split.\nFrom the moment they reach the thickness of a man’s arms, they must be felled.\nThe strong and great are beneath, the soft and weak are above.\nThis is the natural order of things:\nthe refined is above, the coarse is below.\nThe refined must be soft and weak, the coarse must be strong and great.\n\n**Chapter 77: The Dao of Heaven**\nHeaven’s Dao is like drawing a bow.\nWhen the bow is drawn, the upper sinews tighten;\nwhen released, the upper horn relaxes—\nthus, it illustrates Heaven’s raising of the high and lowering of the low.\nThe high are humbled, the low are elevated;\nthe excessive are diminished, the deficient are supplemented.\nHeaven’s Dao is to diminish the excessive and supplement the deficient.\nBut man’s Dao is not so:\nhe diminishes the deficient to serve the excessive.\nHeaven has no favorites, so it is impartial.\nMan is full of bias, so he is not impartial.\nWho, then, can have the excessive to bestow upon the world?\nOnly the sage.\n\nThe sage provides abundantly for all things without claiming credit,\nand though he gives, he becomes even more so.\nThough he shares, he becomes even more abundant—\nnone but the sage can endure this.\nThus, the sage acts without relying on it,\ncompletes his work without dwelling on it—\nis this not because he does not desire to be seen as virtuous?\nIf he acts and relies on it, if he completes his work and takes credit,\nthen virtue will be displayed in the world.\nWhen virtue is displayed in the world,\nit is because he has used the excessive to serve himself.\n\n**Chapter 78: The World’s Softness and Weakness**\nNothing in the world is as soft and weak as water,\nyet nothing can surpass it in overcoming the firm and strong—\nand nothing can replace it.\nThus, the soft overcomes the hard,\nthe weak overcomes the strong—\nyet the world knows this but cannot practice it.\n\nTherefore, the sage says:\n*\"To bear the filth of the state is to be called the guardian of the ancestral altars;\nto bear the misfortunes of the state is to be called the king of the world.\"*\nStraight speech seems paradoxical.\nStraight speech aligns with the Dao yet contradicts convention—\nfor convention holds that bearing filth is shameful,\nand bearing misfortunes is a calamity.\n\n**Chapter 79: Reconciling Great Grievances**\nTo reconcile great grievances will only breed further grievances—\nhow then can it be considered good?\nGrievances arise from delusion,\nand delusion stems from human nature.\nThose who understand human nature do not see delusion,\nand thus, what grievances remain?\nNow, if one does not remove the root yet seeks to reconcile the branches,\nthen though outwardly reconciled, inwardly the resentment lingers.\n\nThus, the sage holds the left contract\nwithout demanding accountability from others.\nTherefore, the virtuous oversee the contracts,\nwhile the unvirtuous oversee the settlements.\nThe left and right contracts exist\nto establish trust and resolve disputes.\n\nThe sage shares this human nature with all,\nyet people take delusion as normal,\nchasing after contention and plunder,\nunaware that their nature has never lacked delusion.\nThus, the sage reveals their true nature to them,\nurging them to eliminate delusion and restore their essence.\nWhen delusion is exhausted and essence is restored,\nthey will naturally attain clarity,\nas the right contract matches the left—\nwithout needing to be demanded, they will submit of their own accord.\n\nThen, even the greatest grievances\nwill dissolve like melting ice,\nknowing that the root was never truly there—\nand what need is there for rewards?\nThose without virtue, however,\nwish to impose this on everyone—\nyet their labor will be in vain.\n\n*Commentary by Pan:*\nThe left contract is taken from others,\nthe right contract is given to others.\nThe left contract is held by those who are held accountable—\nand that is all.\n\nHeaven’s Dao has no favorites,\nyet it always favors the virtuous.\nHeaven’s Dao is impartial,\nand only the virtuous receive its favor.\nThe contracts are also impartial—\nonly those who align with them obtain them.\n\n*Commentary by Ye:*\nIf someone comes to trouble me,\nI only need to hold fast to my integrity and await their response—\nI do not know if they will repay me.\nOnly then can I meet the world’s demands without labor,\njust as Heaven, without favoritism, bestows upon the virtuous alone.\n\n**Chapter 80: Small States, Few People**\nIn a small state with few people,\nLaozi was born in the declining Zhou,\nwhere culture flourished but customs decayed—\nhe wished to remedy this with *wuwei*.\nThus, at the end of his book, he expressed his aspiration:\nto find a small state with few people\nto test his teachings—though he knew it was unattainable.\n\nLet the people have ten or a hundred measures of grain,\nyet not use them.\nLet the people value death so deeply\nthat they do not flee far.\nLet the people each content themselves with their lot,\nso that those with even modest talents\nare not employed by the world.\n\nTen or a hundred measures of grain—\nthose whose abilities suffice to govern ten or a hundred households.\nThey cherish life, so they value
