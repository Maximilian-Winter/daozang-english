Dwelling in ease, they found contentment naturally, all enjoying longevity and tranquility—this was their harmony with the Dao/Way in its true essence.\n\nYet in later ages, human nature grew corrupted, the Dao/Way vanished and *virtue/power (德)* was lost. The original simplicity scattered, the pure became defiled. Lust and desire gnawed within like maggots, sorrow and grief assailed without like spectral flames. Nature swayed with passions, passions were led astray by external influences—dispersed and never gathered, lost and never returned. The pristine essence was exhausted, souls wandered through life and death, chasing fleeting realms and transient causes, trapped in endless suffering with no hope of escape. Truly, this calls for a long sigh of lamentation!\n\nMaster Zhongyang pitied the *Miaoxing (妙行) True Person*, who was well-versed in the Three Teachings (三教), penetrating the wisdom of a hundred schools. He encountered a sage at Ganhé River (甘河), found a kindred spirit in the East Sea (东海), transformed the virtuous men of three prefectures, and bound the five communities (五社) in harmonious ties. His teachings saved and guided beings, benefiting all sentient life and embracing all things.\n\nThose who heard of his ways held him in reverence and awe. Wherever his staff and sandals passed, people gathered like mist, seeking his instruction. He never refused any who came. His verses, songs, and miscellaneous writings flowed effortlessly from nature, composed spontaneously for every occasion.\n\nHis teachings, broadly speaking, led beings back to sincerity and simplicity, to stillness and emptiness, nurturing the eternal soul’s essence, revealing the wondrous nature of *Suchness (真如)*, recognizing the original face of existence, and restoring them to the eternal constancy of the Dao/Way, returning them to its ineffable mystery.\n\nSomeone once asked the True Person: *\"Among all beings in heaven and earth, though humans are said to be the most refined, are they not just one thing among myriad things? Who can escape the cycles of yin and yang? Who can transcend the workings of creation? All that begins must end, all that lives must die—this is the natural order of things. Without cultivating extraordinary *qi (气)*, immortality cannot be sought. Without aligning with one’s predestined fate, the Dao/Way cannot be learned. How can one exhaust oneself in rigid asceticism, chasing shadows or grasping wind, carving ice or sculpting rotten wood, for something that is inevitably unattainable, striving for an impossible result?\"*\n\nThe True Person sighed deeply and said: *\"The mysteries of eternal life are within all people. Who cannot seek the immortal groves? Those who fail from neglect are indeed numerous and obvious; those who succeed through diligence are few and hidden. The world believes what it sees and doubts what it does not see, thus deeming immortality a distant, unattainable dream.\n\nLet us test this with natural principles: iron can be forged from ore, gold refined from copper. Fish that leap beyond Lüliang (吕梁) become dragons, wildfowl that enter great waters transform into *fenghuang (凤凰)*. Even ice, which melts easily, can endure the summer if concealed; grass, which withers quickly, can survive the winter if covered.\n\nIf humans can sever attachment and abandon greed, maintain humility and hold fast to the One, wander their hearts in serenity, and blend their *qi (气)* with the void, they too can ascend to lofty heights, tread upon the light, ride the breezes of the *Killer Wind (寇)*, and traverse the paths of the *True Person’s blessings (真)*. They can ride the whale across the boundless seas, soar with the phoenix to the azure void, living a thousand years like the crane of Liaodong (辽东), or aging in reverse like the teal of Yè County (叶县). Such beings would stand alongside Anqi (安期) and Xiànmén (羡门), the masters of Hongya (洪崖) and Dongxuan (洞玄), as equals in the ranks of immortals—this would not be difficult.\n\nAcross the ages, those who attained the Dao/Way and moved with ease are countless. Yet I say this without evidence: like the deaf who hear no music, or the blind who see no colors, those with shallow insight and narrow hearing cannot truly speak of the Dao/Way.\"*\n\nThe questioner, humbled and awestruck, fell silent and withdrew.\n\nThe True Person then opened the gates of flexibility, revealed the boundless ocean of compassion, and rescued beings from the burning house of suffering, guiding them across the vast mire of delusion. He showed them the primordial roots of life and death, the harmonious interplay of *qi (气)* and spirit, the unity of existence and non-existence, the merging of emptiness and form in the realm of dual forgetting.\n\nFor those who entered this path, it was as if awakening from the *Southern Grove Dream (南柯梦)*; for those who walked its way, it was like sobering from the *wine of Zhongshan (中山)*. They returned to their original truth, complete and without deficiency, and re-entered the undifferentiated unity; they restored their ancestral Dao/Way, unfallen and unlost, and aligned once more with the primordial beginning.\n\nThe nature of the True One is profound and luminous, ever-adapting through transformation and resonance—nowhere does it fail to harmonize.\n\nAfter the True Person’s ascension, his disciples gathered his remaining works, numbering over a thousand pieces. Their language is vast and profound, their meanings vast and deep, steeped in the true winds of the Dao/Way, containing the wondrous essence of existence. They are the very foundation of true cultivation, the ladder by which others are guided across.\n\nThe Daoist communities of Jingzhao (京兆) raised funds and had them printed, though many in the Eastern Prefectures (东州) who followed the Dao/Way found the journey to obtain them too distant. Master Siu (刘), the *Longevity Sage (长生)*, was a beacon of the teaching, a model of the immortal lineage, the foremost master of his age, and the guide for all four directions.\n\nIt is said that the Complete Way’s teachings arose in the West, flourished in the East, and spread throughout the world—vast and profound indeed! Thus, he commissioned *Lingyun (灵玉)* Cao, *Lingyun (灵玉)* Lái, *Shoudao (守道)* Xú, *Zhenyi (真一)* Liú, *Tongzhen (通真)* Liáng, and *Daoqing (道清)* Zháì, all virtuous masters, to journey specially to my homeland and request this preface from me.\n\nThe *True Person’s* (真人) literary collection is divided into nine volumes, which were then printed and widely disseminated to all directions.\n\nThus, those who come after may obtain this collection and delve deeply into its words, as one who digs a well and finds mud—knowing water is not far—\nor who bores wood and sees smoke—knowing fire must be near.\nSo that all may awaken early and swiftly attain the Dao/Way,\nthis is indeed the benevolent one’s (仁者) intent.\n\nAlas! From ancient times, those who cultivated the Dao/Way—\nsome sought teachers by foot only to find them absent,\nothers severed their arms to inquire of the dharma (法) yet failed to grasp it,\nand in the end, even after years of white-headed toil,\nthey knew not where to turn,\nwasting their lives in vain—\nhow deeply regrettable!\n\nNow, the *Complete Dao/Way’s* (全真) literary collection\nscatters among the people,\nits subtle applications and profound mechanisms\nclearly visible and easily understood.\nThose who study and follow it\nwill find great efficacy if they earnestly pursue it,\nand small gains if they seek modestly.\n\nFor those who aspire to the Dao/Way,\nto encounter such a time is indeed fortunate!\n\nOn the first day of *Great Clarity* (清明) in the year *Great Stability* (大定) *Wuxin* (戊申),\n*Fàn Zé Dé* (范择德), the *Learning Officer* (学正) of *Nínghǎi Prefecture* (宁海州),\nrespectfully composed this preface.\n\nThe *First Volume of the Complete Dao/Way’s* (全真集卷之一) *Chóngyáng* (重阳) Collection\nComposed by *Master Chóngyáng* (重阳子) *Wáng Zhé* (王哲) of *Zhòngnán Mountain* (终南山)\n\n「A *Seven-Character Regulated Verse* on *The Bond Beyond the Material World*\n\n**One nephew, two sons, and a mountain recluse**—\nTogether with me, five in heart’s bold quest.\n*Six Bright Ones* join the moon of distant skies,\n*Seven Pure Ones* call the winds from ocean’s breast.\n\nThe *True Marvel* wraps the head in secrets deep,\nUpon the *Clear Sky* treads the *Void’s* expanse.\nEast, west, south, north all turn in perfect round,\nHere alone do I know the *Way*’s vast command.\n\n**One brother, one nephew**, two more in this band,\nWith me, five *Leisurely Ones* seek the *Dao/Way*’s grand.\nBound as *True Kin* beyond the world’s embrace,\nWe cast off dusty forms, these hollow, fleeting shapes.\n\nA *Pure Quiet* landscape planted all around,\nThe *Purple Lingzhi* passed from hand to hand.\nTo *Longhua’s* gathering on the mountain’s height,\nI first pay homage to *Penglai’s* lofty guide.\n\n*Master* in *Ninghai* donned in military garb,\nWith his brother, begging on the streets.\nA vast scroll he bore, upon it wrote these two,\nTo lure *Mǎ Yǔ* along in search and quest.\n\n*Mǎ Sān*, squint-eyed, begged in those days,\nCalled by others *Harmful to the Wind*.\nFive hues of fortune on his body seen,\nOne spark of *Dao/Way’s* light only he has known.\n\nEight lines he gathered—*one* swift glance to seize—\nSeven-character verses promised, clear as day.\nOn both sides of the street, the wealthy thronged,\nYet none knew who the silkworm sought.\n\nWhite for bones, red for flesh, they say,\nRed and white together form a hollow clay.\nYesterday they called him *Master Chongyang*,\nToday they see him with his brother, begging.\n\nBodies differ, minds are strange—none grasp the truth,\nFaces change, yet none perceive the *Dao/Way’s* proof.\nA thousand years of worldly toil in vain,\nA hundred years but like a fleeting glance.\n\n*Na Sūn*’s Inquiry\nOn your own body, speak not of worth or low,\nBut match the *Three Lights* to *Primordial Tao/Way*’s glow.\nRectify the *Four Gates*, let teaching spread,\nOne *Nature*’s essence opens wide and free.\nIn *Cool Tranquility*, you dwell with ease,\nAt leisure, time itself obeys your decree.\n\n*Elixir of Immortality* stolen from fate’s hand,\nTrue joy unfolds when all desires stand.\nTo *Master Bàn*’s Question—First Clarity, Then the *Way*\n*Release* and *Dao/Way* share one ancient root,\nTwo forms yet one in essence, never askew.\n*True Awakening* sees the heart’s own light,\n*Mercury* and *Lead* unite—good seeds take flight.\n\n*Mǎ Zǐ*, do not let rivers shift your oar,\nNor monkeys mimic sands, forever more.\nThe *Lamp of Wisdom* blazes past the clouds,\nPiercing mist to reveal the *Five Colors*’ shrouds.\n\n*Lǚ Gōng*’s Desire to Retire and Seek the *Dao/Way*\nWith *Three Paths*’ law, he walks with care,\nLike ice beneath his feet, the abyss laid bare.\nTo *Three Paths*’ retreat, he turns with grace,\nIn *One Marvel*’s essence, he becomes *Pure Clarity*.\n\nWithin stillness, he refines the heart’s bright moon,\nWhere he finds light, his wisdom’s lamp is spun.\nA *True Teacher* comes to guide his way,\nTo *Yùfēng Peak*’s summit, he ascends to play.\n\n*Wáng Gōng*’s Inquiry on the *Five Gates*\nAt *Five Aggregates*’ mountain, the *Five Gates* unfold,\n*Qi* and *Shen* entwined like *Peach of Jade*’s gold.\nWith *One Decision*, his nature’s light takes flight,\nIn *True Stillness*, his essence shines—no dimness in sight.\n\nBeyond the world, the *Blue Sky*’s eternal stay,\nThe *Bright Moon* lingers in the void’s array.\n*Blue Boy* presents *Golden Elixir*’s art,\nOnly *Primordial Tao/Way*’s seekers may impart.\n\n*Mǎ Gōng*’s Inquiry on *Equality*\nCome and go must recognize the *Fixed Star*’s span,\nExit and enter still discern the *Luminous One*’s plan.\nHis transgressions match my own in kind,\nMay all beings share my heart’s pure mind.\n\nI’ve communed with *Heaven’s* and *Earth’s* spirits bright,\nNow I glimpse *Uchang*’s nature—fragrant, clear, and light.\nThis is the *True Marvel*’s secret key,\nIf you follow, you’ll reach *Heaven’s* lofty decree.\n\n*Zhāng Gū*’s Inquiry\nThe *Nine-Leaf Golden Flower* blooms in endless grace,\n*Eight Channels of Jade Water* flow at will’s embrace.\nThe *Seven Gates* open wide—all paths revealed,\nThe *Four Symbols* shine, yet all dissolve in *Void*’s veil.\n\nOne grain of *Divine Elixir* returns to right,\nTwo strands of *Silver Threads* bind *Primordial Tao/Way*’s light.\nBrilliant hues know their own true share,\nWhen fruit is ripe, no lack—only joy remains.\n\n*Grinding the Mirror*\nGrinding mirrors strives to polish *my* own heart,\nIts depths reflect far, yet still they part.\n*Mirror’s* return strips name and gain away,\nRevealing *Void*’s truth—no trace to stay.\n\nOne spark of *Dao/Way’s* light ignites the *Fire Path*,\nA million hues of *Pure Clarity* rise from lofty height.\n*Master Jiào* takes the *Mystic Treasure* true,\nHangs it in *Bright Hall* to pierce through ages’ hue.\n\n*In Harmony with the Falling Flowers’ Rhythm*\nNo need to scheme for lofty flight,\n*Blue Cave*’s pearl requires no lock in sight.\nLong weary of the world’s vain chase,\nI scorn the name and profit, false and base.\n\nHow best to guard the heart’s own ground,\nWhy cling to robes of street and town?\nFlowers fall beyond the gates—let winds and rains take sway,\nWho will awaken to *Xīyí*’s hidden way?\n\n*Inscribed on the Red and White Peonies*\nRed and white silk twisted into clusters tight,\nOn *Blue Silk* screens they stand in orderly flight.\nFragrance drifts far, no difference known,\nThough forms diverge, each holds its proper throne.\n\nLong ago, the world forgot the *Three Islands*’ seed,\nNow men mistake these two as one, indeed.\nI pluck them now to join their *Tao/Way*’s return,\nEach step through clouds and mists, the *Rainbow Crane*’s turn.\n\n*Master Chí*’s Annotation on the *Dao/Way’s* and *Virtue’s* *Classic*\nIn *Five Thousand Words* of *Tao/Way’s* *Great Sage*’s might,\nThe *Dao/Way* nameless shines with marvel’s light.\nOne

Self* with *Floating Bamboo’s* grace.\nNo need for incense’s fire to burn,\nNo need to seek the *Teaching Wind*’s turn.\n\nHe opens *Lingming*’s light both near and far,\nLets *Xīngyào*’s radiance

Practice\nEven at a hundred, practice is not late,\nOnly the heart must shift its fate.\nThis life cannot reach the *Tao/Way*’s full height,\nNext life’s promise grants the path of light.\n\nAt parting’s hour, one spark must be refined,\nThe *Three Lights* gathered—none will be left behind.\nCast off the new, abandon the old,\nRemove the new—*Lingzhi*’s essence unfolds.\n\n*To Master Xué Dào* Who Seeks the *Dao/Way*\nPractice is hindered by a clever mind,\nYet *Golden Adamantine* calls—what’s left behind?\nBefore men, he boasts of outward grace,\nWithin, his eyes grow dim—his steps astray.\n\n*True Alchemy*’s key lies hard to find,\n*Dao/Way’s* essence rare—*Jade Science*’s mind.\nHe leaves his wife and sons, what will he say?\nFuture sins will weigh how light or heavy they’ll sway.»\n\n**To Master Liu Jiang Zhang Yizhong**\nUpon receiving Zhang Liang’s *Dao/Way* scripture,\nHe wanders through fair scenes, finding cool clarity.\nHis feet tread paths where water and stone merge,\nHis gaze sweeps clouds and mountains—like a painted screen.\nTen thousand households gleam with three dark birds,\nA hundred flowers and grasses share one fragrant breath.\n\nNow I turn back—do not blame my public face,\nYet I ride the southern *Bi*’s emerald *Dongting* lake.\n\n**Spring Rain**\nA spring rain nourishes the marsh like butter—\nA blessing for the *Tai Ping* age.\nHeaven bestows its *qi* to aid the people’s harmony.\nThe wandering clouds form a canopy—*Three Lights* shine,\nHarmonious *qi* brings auspicious signs, nurturing all things.\nHis enlightened heart grows ever still,\nHis *Dao/Way*-eyes clearer with each wash.\nWith staff in hand, he treads the cloud-paths high,\nSeeking leisure—his jade carriage overturned.\n\n**Instructing the Simple and Unrefined**\nA scholar of *Dao/Way* meets his match—\nHis crude nature demands harsh refining.\nTo awaken the blind, fan the fire within his heart,\nTo open the ignorant, wield the sword of laughter.\nIf he heeds my teaching and returns,\nLet him join our ranks—his fate will turn.\n\n*Ji-ji-ji*—the sage-king’s decree,\nWithout thought, without care, in blissful *Tao/Way*.\n\n**Alchemy of the Iron Pot**\nIf black *qi* is destroyed in the body,\nOn *Badu* Mountain, recognize the *Three Fields*.\nStillness is the return to *Xu*’s emptiness,\nIn chaos, where shall you seek the *Mystic Dao*?\nOn wood, seek gold; on water, nurture fire-lotus.\nGentlemen, recognize the *Sword-and-Cinnabar* method,\nAnd aid the *Kingly Wind* with iron-pot coinage.\n\n**Inscription for the *Xiaoyao* Pavilion**\n*Xiaoyao*, *Xiaoyao*—this *Xiaoyao*!\nLaughing at pines and bamboo, trusting their knocks.\nFrom now on, white clouds come to the cave’s mouth,\nNo need for green waters or distant mountains.\nThe *Du* River scholar sighs in vain at filth,\nThe *Ge* Hall poet mocks in empty wit.\nStill, who knows this truth?\nCast aside tortoise hair and hare’s horn alike.\n\n**Master Yang’s Inquiry**\nSeven feet tall, his frame a borrowed guise,\nHis robes and meals surpass three men’s share.\nDo not boast of his ordinary bones,\nFor his golden form stands six *zhang* high.\nAwakened, he unites the four directions’ mysteries,\nEnlightened, he binds the eastern *Du*’s perfect cause.\nHis transformed body spans a thousand feet—unobstructed,\nTurning the *Dharma* Wheel in the mortal realm.\n\n**Sending Military Judge Brother to Seek the *Anle* Method**\nTo seek true joy, cultivate the root cause,\nOpen your heart and leave behind defilement.\nIn noise, do not let *qi* be wasted,\nIn stillness, let your spirit be fully nourished.\nNaturally, you will recognize the *Three Lights*’ brilliance,\nDecisively harmonize the four seasons’ spring.\nExternally, your form gleams with clarity,\nInternally, your true joy shines—\nMortals unaware, you become an immortal.\n\n**To My Elder Brother**\nWho among kin understands the gold in water?\nIn *Ji Mao* and *Ren Chen*, we each seek our path.\nI have already returned to the old *Yunshui* recluse,\nUrging you: abandon ambition and name.\nThe *En* Mountain’s love, the *Hai*’s depths—when will they be crossed?\nThe *Fire House*’s snares encroach daily.\nDo not be ensnared by earthly slopes,\nFor *Penglai* holds higher, finer peaks.\n\n**Three Essentials for Practice**\nBegging for the *Upper* (alchemical substances),\nWalking the *Middle* (talismans),\nSetting the *Lower* (medicines).\nEmpty without purpose—this is not the way.\nBegging for those who walk talismans and set medicines—\nThese are the three true practices.\nInternally, without purpose, *qi* cannot be refined,\nExternally, labor damages the spirit.\nIf not sought from the origin’s deepest mystery,\nWhere else shall you find the primal cause?\nHere, the *Changshun* scene is uncovered—\nThus, *Xiaoyao* emerges from the six defilements.\n\n**Master Wang’s Request for Release of Life**\nKnowing you can observe your own self,\nAll life is equal—no distinction between us.\nOnly the form differs, yet all may fly and be whole.\nYour virtue matches mountains and rivers’ boundless grace,\nYour *virtue/power* flows like streams of blessing.\nThe *yin* principles are fulfilled—all debts repaid,\nHis immortal years are offered on the celestial altar.\n\n**Inscription for Master Ma’s True Person’s Hall**\nIn person, I seek the *True Sage* at *Kunlun*’s peak,\nWhere ridges and mist lock the *Taihu* void.\nSharp *qi* draws the idle guest,\nHarmful winds welcome the colored clouds to dwell.\nGolden *qi* forges the true spirit’s nature,\nWhite jade contains the original beginning.\nDo not praise *Zhongnan*’s fine scenery—\nWherever the immortals gather, it is as such.\n\n**On the Copulation of Dragon and Tiger**\nDo not ask of Dragon’s child or Tiger’s kin—\nThe single point in your heart is the true teacher.\nAdjust the *qi*, steady the spirit, and call for union,\nWith upright heart and devout essence, nurture warmth.\nEquality is the *Great Dao*’s way,\nPurity and non-retreat bring true compassion.\nEach manifestation reveals the round light,\nGuiding the *Golden Elixir* to gather *Jade Grass*.\n\n**Master Sun’s Inquiry on the Three Teachings**\nThe *Ru*’s gate, the *Release*’s household, and the *Dao*’s path all communicate,\nThe Three Teachings share one ancestral wind.\nAwakened, you know the entering and exiting,\nEnlightened, you perceive the vast and boundless.\nSpirit and *qi* surpass comparison—\nSun, moon, stars, and constellations may align.\nUnderstanding principles, discerning texts clears disputes,\nAbove the clear sky, you observe the empty sky.\n\n**Master Ren’s Inquiry on Original Nature**\nLike gold, like jade, like pearl—\nVivid, five-colored, spread wide.\nTen thousand rays of light remain unseen,\nA clump of dust obscures it all.\nWash and polish to reveal its round form,\nGrind and refine to show its original state.\nNeither extinction nor birth—leisurely radiant,\nOnly then do you reclaim its ancient measure.\n\n**The Wooden Fish**\nHollow, heartless, hung in the hall’s courtyard,\nIts own strikes echo *dang-ding*.\nIts cultivation bears fruit—it draws offerings,\nAwakens monks and nuns to chant the scriptures.\nWater cannot contain its baited line,\nFire cannot free it from its wooden form.\nSuddenly, moonlit wind arrives at dawn,\nBlowing apart its clinging vines—its fragrance lingers.\n\n**Ode to Laziness**\nI laugh at my own laziness, though called \"diligent,\"\nIn dreams, I record the root cause with a brush.\nReturning greetings, I keep my mouth shut,\nSeeing food, though hungry, I do not speak.\nPaper robes, hemp clothes cover my body,\nUnkempt hair, filthy face—yet I preserve the *True*.\nNine years in one sleep before I wake,\nFor fear of toil’s weariness, my spirit dims.\n\n**The Bell**\nCast in the west wind’s likeness,\nSuspended in the void, its form honored.\nEighty-one strikes mark the *Yang*’s *Yao* number,\nOne hundred and eight tolls the *Yin*’s *De* name.\nThus, *Dao* families divide *Zi* and *Wu*,\nAnd *Release*’s children distinguish *Xu* and *Ying*.\nIf those beside you will long endure its service,\nIt is the one who truly knows its own voice.\n\n**Congee of Barley**\nHoneyed clouds, whiter than frost,\nCalled *Yazheng*—its fragrance distinct and pure.\n\n**The Jade Scepter**\nA precious blade splits jade with light ease,\nA silver spoon swirls to pour the nectar’s flow.\nThe Golden Boy presents fragrant, luminous elixir,\nThe Celestial Guest chews open light like snow’s hue.\nAll five *zàng* organs now corrected stand,\nHenceforth eternal coolness ever prevails.\n\n**The Drum Tower**\nAt dusk and dawn, the horn’s mournful cry,\nWith rapid drums dispels pestilence and calamity.\nWater droplets fall in measured time, their rhythm true,\nEach clang and toll aligns with fate’s precise decree.\nA hundred years pass in relentless nightly pressure,\nA lifetime’s bloom fades as each night hastens near.\nI urge the poet to awaken early,\nLest the fifth watch’s call steal your clarity.\n\n**Jiang Gong’s Drum Tower**\nIts *jīng* blue form holds the Three *Treasures*’ essence,\nA towering structure built with solemn intent.\nTo let its sound resound beyond the void,\nAnd let its pure tones permeate the world.\nA single strike of true gold’s thunder,\nShakes the Ten Directions to their own accord.\nGreat and small alike bow in reverence,\nEach one attaining *Perfect Enlightenment*.\n\n**On the Zen and Dao**\nIn Zen, the *Dao* is glimpsed yet powerless to act,\nIn *Dao*, Zen’s depths are known—no love nor hate.\nThe adept who masters both is highest of all,\nWhile the one who gains but one is truly a sage.\nWhere *Dao*-emotion deepens, clarity stills the mind,\nWhen Zen’s flavor is pure, the heart’s chaos finds peace.\nNow cease your Zen and *Dao*—both rise as one,\nAnd naturally ascend to that which transcends them.\n\n**Attending the Governor of Dengzhou at the Qingbai Hall**\nWithin the Qingbai Hall, a spring of crystal clear,\nIts depths profound, its waves both limpid and bright.\nEndless it rolls, its flow never ceases,\nSplashing forth to nourish those with destiny’s grace.\nThrough lattice windows, light filters like jade’s essence,\nAt the door, gusts scatter shadows—golden lotus in flight.\nFragrant mist fills the hall, the spirit’s waves converge,\nA pearl of clarity lifted to the azure sky.\n\n**Dawn Awakening**\nI seek the original source—its truth is self-evident,\nRelease its radiance to extinguish all passions.\nThe Three *Treasures* now pierce through *Right Awareness*,\nOne mind—why fear it not attain *Perfect Enlightenment*?\nMastering subtle applications, clarity’s depths are known,\nRecognizing profound mysteries, purity’s light is shown.\nThe mortal form dissolves as guest beyond the clouds,\nOn the Path of Eternal Life, I stride with steady tread.\n\n**Strolling at Xingqing Pool**\nWith carefree step, I wander through Xingqing’s embrace,\nYet find it but these fleeting illusions’ trace.\nRain flips lotus leaves—pearls burst in splendor,\nWind rolls bamboo tips—jewels cling to branches.\nSpring’s verdant green, summer’s crimson lotus bloom,\nAutumn’s chill clarity, winter’s jade-like gem.\nThrough jade’s transparent depths, the source is sought,\nBut asking of its flow—none know its path.\n\n**At the Zen Gate: The First Rain’s Invitation**\nTo seek the formless, first distinguish east and west,\nTo pierce the mundane, see all as one.\nOn Snowy Peak, I search for *Right Awareness*,\nOn Crimson Cliffs, I play with emptiness.\nThese messages are wrapped in spring’s light,\nThese causes hidden in the moon’s reflection.\nDo not cling to the courtyard’s pine’s shadow,\nYour true nature is your own ancestral wind.\n\n**The Old Monk on Life and Death**\nAll my life, I’ve grasped the *Great Vehicle’s* truth,\nIn harmony with jade’s tones and gold’s voice.\nOn the path of *Right Awareness*, I climb the lofty ridge,\nToward *Bodhi*, I step beyond the mortal slope.\nWith wisdom’s fruit, I taste the white lotus’s bloom,\nMy true nature soars past the *Sacred Tree’s* bough.\nFrom this point, no birth nor death shall bind,\nFixed in *Prajñā* and *Bodhisattva*’s light.\n\n**A Virtuous Friend Asks of Cultivation and the Dao**\nDo not entangle yourself in worldly affairs,\nFor *Qinglián*—purity—begins with stillness.\nWith wisdom’s lamp, I often prune and polish,\nIn the heart’s field, I daily till and weed.\nLet not the incense of fortune ever fade,\nCut down the thorns of vexation—clear the path.\nWhen the seeds of *Lingyīng* flourish, the work is done,\nCarry them forth to offer at *Potalaka’s* gate.\n\n**Master Su Seeks Resignation from Office**\nAll speak of *Qinglián*—purity’s ease,\nYet none but the *Penglai* Sage attain it.\nBeyond the *Wuji*, clouds and mists are my companions,\nIn half the sky, wind and moon my causes.\nTo master *Miaoyuan*—effortless transcendence,\nWisdom must shift as swiftly as it flows.\nThe Master sheds his mortal form,\nAnd here, we speak of years beyond time.\n\n**The Dream**\nIn joyful play, the outer world draws near,\nYet in the midnight slumber, truth reveals itself clear.\nThe Seven *Po* spirits dance with demons’ guile,\nThe Three *Shi* delight in draining life’s vital tide.\nThe mind-monkey is bound—no defilement clings,\nThe thought-horse is captured—no nocturnal wanderings.\nThe four false forms trade in daylight’s fleeting market,\nYet in truth, how different from those who sleep in darkness?\n\n**Master Lü Asks for a *Gold Justified* Verse from the *Diamond Sutra***\nThe *Diamond Sutra’s* first four lines begin with *Mahā*,\nThen seek the six-character hymn’s pure path.\nWith wisdom’s blade, I sever *Prajñā*’s veil,\nTo cross the shore and prove *Bodhisattva*’s worth.\nTo know the heart, to see true nature—this is *Perfect Enlightenment*,\nTo grasp the *Mercury* and *Lead* of alchemy’s art—*Mìdū*’s sweetness revealed.\nFrom this core, the *orthodox* meaning is found,\nAscending to the *Pure Realm*, leaving *Sahā*’s dust behind.\n\n**Master Yu Asks of Master Su’s Childhood Abstinence**\nThis cause lies not in mortal feasts,\nNor in fasting’s guise to shape the face.\nTo nourish *qi*, I drink the elixir’s essence,\nTo sustain the spirit, I rest like clouds at ease.\nWhen cultivation’s merit fills the measure,\nThe *Mercury* and *Lead* unite—this world is left behind.\nOnly when the outer dross is purged away,\nShall radiance return in its full, eternal round.\n\n**On *Qinglián* (Purity and Tranquility)**\nLet not the mind’s clarity be strained by turmoil,\nOn nature’s stillness, raise the wisdom’s blade.\nCrush the dust of red passions—find what’s truly gained,\nSplit the void of black ignorance—know the potter’s wheel.\nThrough peaks, the moon’s light is my companion,\nBeyond ridges, lone clouds are my kin.\nAs neighbors in retreat, we part in joy,\nTo wander the Three Isles, seeking peaches of immortality.\n\n**A Layman Jokes of Stealing My Feet**\nFortunate indeed to meet a *Count of My Native Land*,\nWould I dare steal your feet to add to my own?\nYou’ve not yet suffered the Three *Poisons’* anguish,\nI’ve already escaped the *Nine Abysses’* bond.\nMy heart is like the moon—bright and boundless,\nMy nature flows with *Dao*—pure and unfettered.\nThough short my step, long strides shall soon be mine,\nAnd teach the *Eastern Sea’s* soul to circle the world.\n\n**The Inspector of Yandu Asks of Eternal Life**\nYour Excellency’s loyalty shines in your question,\nYet even now, the hour’s struck—one toll to reckon.\nThe five *qi* are clear, their cycles marked,\nThe *Jia* and *Gēng* days reversed—refine the Three *Péng*.\nI seek the golden vessel of ancient lore,\nTo emerge from the fiery furnace of this age’s test.\nNow grasp the *Penglai’s* true path,\nAnd sit firm on *Youtai*—sipping jade wine with zest.\n\n**Master Song Asks of Cultivation**\nPolish the mind’s core—let wisdom flow,\nAnd from its depths, jade blossoms shall grow.\nIn the Three *Fields*, treasures rare await the morning dew,\nA single grain of cinnabar withers as the twilight’s hue.\nIts crimson glow fades to pale mist,\nIts radiance shifts—from white to fiery red.\n\n**The Essence of the Dao: Formless and Void**\n\nFrom the void’s true display of empty form,\nEmpty wrapped in emptiness—its nature, void’s own norm.\n**Cultivation**—this path so hard to trace,\nTurns out to be but the mind’s true, boundless grace.\n\nThe crimson-clad noble roams the hills and streams,\nThe black-hatted sage dives into the furnace’s gleam.\nWhen the white steed snorts, gold echoes in its cry,\nWhere the green ox plows, jade’s luster never dies.\nHeaven-high pillars, earth-rooted radiance gleam,\nThe *Dragon Embrace* and *Terhapa*’s smallest flame.\n\nGreat alchemy’s path knows no end to refinement,\nThe *Cold Furnace*’s folly belongs to my kin.\nPure winds veil the face—*True Qi*’s breath,\nBright moon’s glow reveals the *Cinnabar*’s wealth.\nEver check the old form, ever polish anew,\nAnd pluck fresh likeness from the void’s hue.\n\nA single spark cast into the azure sky,\nPierces the void—its image begins to rise.\nDragon’s roar stirs the tiger’s wrath,\nSnow-waves and winds swirl, tossing in wrath.\nPurifying one soul, adding to its glow,\nHarmonizing two *qi*—their union does bestow.\n\nThe tortoise strides through the waves’ play,\nThe crimson phoenix alights on the peak’s sway.\nOne bright moon wheel, its light so grand,\nIlluminates the *Sanmao*’s peak, where it stands.\nSince first I’ve glimpsed the Dao’s true face,\nToday I know the old self’s embrace.\n\nDetached from the world, a guest of the clouds,\nFree from the dust, no earthly bounds.\nFor once I’ve seized the *Cinnabar*’s core,\nIt’s all been the *Mercury*’s lore.\n\nA spark of clarity returns to the still,\nA rounded light wraps the face—*Golden Wheel*’s thrill.\nThe *Mysterious Pass*’s secret I’ve claimed,\nRefined for *Chongyang*—all darkness tamed.\n\nFrom now on, flames multiply on the wood,\nAnd gold is boiled in the river’s flood.\nWhat god responds to these wonders seen?\nOne *True Soul*—its awe is mine.\n\nGathered as form, dispersed as *qi*,\nIn clear skies, it travels—eternally free.\nThe *Fetal Immortal* dances, becoming divine,\nAll from the right path, the ancient design.\n\nWhy circle the *Dan Field* with gold and tiger’s might?\nNo need for the *Treasure Cauldron*—let the dragon ignite.\nScold the *Lead-Mercury* pair—calm is their due,\nSwap *Yin-Yang*—they’ll grow ever anew.\n\nA streak of red dawn on the mountain’s crest,\nThe returning light shines on the *Azure Crane*’s nest.\nClouds severed, the moon’s radiance is clear,\nThe *Divine Vessel* glides beside the shore’s sheer.\n\nWhen water and fire meet, the path opens wide,\nWood and gold parted—eternal life’s guide.\n*Lead* black, *Mercury* red—south and north divide,\n*White Tiger* and *Green Dragon* shift with *Jia* and *Geng*’s stride.\n\nHold fast to this method—its truth is refined,\nIn the void, a *Jade Silk Pavilion* defined.\nSince the light’s clear, no need for search’s toil,\nNo petty debate on shallow or deep—avoil.\n\nSeated true, the *Child of Midday*’s seen,\nThe *Ding-Ren*’s head reveals the path’s keen.\nFive hues in steps, one *Dao Mystery*’s tide,\nGrasp the void’s marvel—let it be your guide.\n\nInhale and exhale, subtle and fine,\nNurture the *Pearl*—its origin divine.\n*Mother-Child*’s pair follow, hues intertwined,\n*Qi* and *Spirit* converge—lights uniquely aligned.\n\nUpside-down union, secrets revealed,\nTop and bottom’s clash—*Pivot Axis*’s healed.\nTo the deep mountain’s highest peak,\nAlone, I bloom—*Moon Wheel*’s sleek.\n\nFrom the start, I’ve learned to twist the winds,\nScatter them in the *Yao Pool*—*Jade Lotus*’s seeds.\nOne branch grows, its brilliance unmatched,\nFive leaves unfurl—each perfect, each matched.\n\nOnce I’ve seen the Dao’s profound art,\nNow I know its natural heart.\nNo longer bound by the four seasons’ rush,\nIn *Eternal Spring*’s realm, years lose their crush.\n\nCultivate with the *Nine Suns*’ chart,\nKnow the *Suns*’ lore—all things shall part.\nThe wise shall transcend the *造化*’s* fate,\nThe fool wastes effort—his toil’s in vain.\n\nGained, it’s seen through—void within has form,\nCompleted, how’s it like—form within the void’s norm?\nVoid has form, form has void, void’s no void,\nForm’s within void—*Heaven’s Path*’s employed.\n\nKnow the hand’s start—avoid the *Three Realms*’’ snare,\nScold the past self—this mortal’s affair.\nInto the fire, dare to dive and blaze,\nCross the river—no need to drown or sway.\n\nAt noon, the *Essence*’s brilliance gleams,\nIn the moon’s embrace, the *Jade Forest*’s dreams.\nThis *Great Cinnabar* returns to the world’s beyond,\nFree and unfettered—its journey’s unbound.\n\n**The Eternal Student of the Dao**\nEmpty boasts of cultivation—what’s ever been?\nOnly to show off before men’s eyes, then.\n\nHard to grasp the scholar’s void, yet they fear the test,\nUnfamiliar with the *Buddha’s Path*—they scorn the quest.\nAmidst wealth and desires, they seek to rise,\nIn wine and flesh’s depths, they hope to prize.\n\nIn the world, no sin’s ever been,\nYet Dao’s pursuit adds burdens ten.\nKeep the heart upright—no evil’s bred,\nThe *Three Teachings*’ truths merge as one thread.\n\nWhen principles shine, what’s left to differ?\nAfter *Mystic Dao*’s grasp, no need to stir.\nAll things are set aside, pure and clear,\nThe *Eternal Person*’s rebirth draws near.\n\nTruly longing for the Dao’s way,\nNo ties remain—my body stays.\nIn stillness, stillness grows—its grace refined,\nIn leisure, leisure’s peak—no need to find.\n\nThen I’ll act free, yet know peace’s art,\nDays pass with coolness, wisdom’s my part.\nNo need to seek the *Immortal’s* lot,\nJust sit on the *White Flower Lotus*—my spot.\n\nLast year in *Ninghai*’s army I stayed,\nThis year in *Wéndēng*’s county I roamed.\nTwo years past, cold to warmth’s sway,\nTwo seasons through—darkness to light’s play.\n\nThis reversal, who else understands?\nThis *Yin-Yang*’s shift—I alone command.\nA single ounce of true gold emerges bright,\nNo need to forge—it’s already right.\n\nLike this, know the Dao’s outer hold,\nThe heart and spirit—your guides, your gold.\nAncient cases must be sought and found,\nYour own *Dao Wind*—let it be unbound.\n\nRefined, the *Awakened Mind*’s clear,\nFilled, the *Old Compassion*’s sheer.\nCompassion and purity stand side by side,\nSudden enlightenment—no things can bind.\n\nKnow the *Heart’s Flower*—it breeds the wind,\n*Mercury-Lead*’s secrets, pure and refined.\nWithin the *Three Thousand*, use the *Thousand Dawn*’s law,\nIn ten years’ span, pass the *Nine Transformations*’ flaw.\n\nHues layered, white’s purity spread,\nA single light—red’s brilliance shed.\nVoid’s reflection returns to the void’s face,\nIlluminating true void—void’s not empty space.\n\nHow many follow the stream’s flow?\nI stand alone—fools’ company’s woe.\nWhen hunger comes, I feast on *oyster rice*,\nCold returns—I wear coarse clothes, no vice.\n\nPoetry cannot split the profound subtlety,\nThe heart’s *incense-scent* (*xīnsū*) hard to discern.\n\nNot only must one guard it when gained,\nBut return it to its source—no taxing claim.\n\n---\n**A Tea Ode (1–7 characters per line)**\nTea, tea.\nJade cups, gem buds.\nBorn of void wisdom, blooming void splendor.\nClears the spirit’s *qi*, summons clouds and mist.\nPrecisely my heart’s affair—\nDo not boast of worldly tastes.\n\nOne cup stirs Li Bai’s joy,\nSeven bowls belong to Lu Quan’s kin.\nOnly gold can brew jade buds,\nReleasing *golden blossoms* through the strainer.\n\n---\n**Alcohol, alcohol, alcohol.**\nFilthy lips, foul mouth.\nDulls the nature, dulls the spirit.\nDiminishes true *qi*, erodes lifespan’s thread.\nHalf-drunk, the gut aches with sorrow;\nDrunk deep, the mind collapses.\nTo oneself, it invites reckless rage;\nTo others, no shame remains.\nBetter never drink—eternally awake,\nNo harm, no calamity—cultivate the *Nine Nines*.\n\n---\n**Desire, desire, desire.**\nBrings misfortune, drains virtue.\nDiminishes *jin* essence, harms *yè* fluid.\nShatters *qi* and spirit, ruins benevolence.\nCan leave the *Three Fields* barren,\nConfuse the *Five Viscera*.\nExtinguishes the luminous soul,\nExhausts the limbs’ sinew and strength.\nBetter abstain—enduringly boundless,\nNo harm, no calamity—eternally flourishing.\n\n---\n**Wealth, wealth, wealth.**\nSows sin, acts as matchmaker.\nBuys desire, invites the cup.\nFurther corrupts virtue, invites disaster.\nAccumulates the *Three Realms’* suffering,\nMakes escape from *Nine Abysses* hard.\nThough it swells the family’s fortune,\nHow can one avoid *samsara*’s wheel?\nBetter not seek it—constantly content,\nNo harm, no calamity—ever abundant.\n\n---\n**Qi, qi.**\n\n**Qi, qi.**\n\nDestroys the spirit, harms the stomach.\nSummons **xīng** (猩) and **líng** (狞)—how foul the taste!\nSeven orifices still unobstructed,\nTwo eyes bright as boiling water.\nDao/Way’s sentiment cannot be turned,\nThe king’s

wide,\nLeaping free from **Sìfēi**’s gate.\nAlready a guest of the void,\nWhy linger as earth’s lost soul?\n\nThree sacred peaks stand tall,\nFour seasons’ warmth enfolds.\nAll things are **non-being**,\nNon-being—do not debate.\nEyes blind, ears deaf—\nNo voice, no sound penetrates.\n\nUrge them to cease their **Chàngyù** song,\nAsk them why they stir the wind.\nIf not revering sages’ worth,\nWhy court the harm of fate’s design?\n\nAll things are delusion’s play,\nAll forms are empty air.\nWife and daughter—iron of a thousand *jīn*,\nSons and grands—copper of ten thousand *dàn*.\nHow do they know of darkness’ grip,\nYet still chase after crimson glow?\nEvil deeds accumulate,\nGood roots find no shelter here.\nBoasting of the body’s strength,\nThe heart drifts like a floating reed.\nHow few know their primal source,\nHow few recall their ancestors’ way.\nWould they fret over earthly graves,\nOr speak of heaven’s halls?\nOnly greed for wealth and desire,\nBlindness to all wisdom’s light.\nIf walking the Path of Equal Worth,\nOne stumbles into **Wǔhuā**’s snare.\n\n---\n**Seven-Character Long Poem (Hidden Head)**\n**Continuing to Gift to Master Wáng Zǐróng of the

single grain of gold elixir—none recognize it,\nA lifetime’s essence and vitality—who could ever guess it?\n\n**To Master Siwu (Four Mulberry)**\n\nThe recluse of Seven Pines abandons worldly dust,\nThe Five Willows Master sheds all clinging ties.\nWhen the magistrate’s fame shall come to fruition,\nHe may yet call you, Master of Four Mulberry.\n\nFour mulberry trees stand in astonished wonder,\nTwo broomrape blossoms laugh as if in anger.\nLong seated, the cool breeze summons me—\nThis night, I’ll dwell beside the moon as neighbor.\n\n**To Dong Defu**\n\nIn leisure, I wander, seeking the True—\nCold detachment, pure void, my host.\nYour radiant鬓 still boast their former glory,\nYet Defu still treads the crimson dust.\n\n**To Master Du of Jingzhao**\n\nDo not speak of white snow or yellow buds,\nNor of lead, silver, or cinnabar.\nAsk Master Du of the Great Dao—\nDoes Kunlun Mountain belong to whom?\n\n**To Monk Dingyuan of Liu Jiangcun**\n\nJade-named Pal\n\nThe fool who laughs at life’s blind snare,\nAll claim to nurture family’s care.\nYet family’s but a fire to burn the flesh,\nDrying clay—when gone, but dust it is.\n\nNow I would counsel those lost in dust:\nSeek the Dao’s fruit, the true cause.\nA spark of insight—then you’ll see:\nBefore the wind, you’re but a heap of dust.\n\nThe Yang should not cling to Yin’s embrace,\nFor Yin will mar your virtue’s base.\nRefine pure Yang—seven treasures born,\nOn the Path of No-Birth, no dust is sworn.\n\nAt leisure, I sit, watching common men,\nEach digging paths where none are then.\nLike fish that cling to water’s flow,\nThey know not dust—yet sink in dust below.\n\nIn this world’s wheel, all turn and turn,\nEach soul’s nature, each cause is earned.\nA hundred years—from womb to dust,\nThe Five Aggregates return to dust.\n\nSteady the Azure Ox, as ancient sages did,\nThe White Ox’s branch—its root is hid.\nConfucius, the Physician, three teachings blend,\nTill fools awaken lest they sink to dust again.\n\nBorn and die—ten thousand souls pass through,\nGood fruit and cause between the two.\nJealousy, greed, pride in wealth and rank—\nI walk apart, beyond your dusty bank.\n\nWho knows the man within the market’s throng?\nDo-nothing, act-nothing—let fate belong.\nWhite clouds guide me, wind and moon my kin,\nFree of toil, I leave the world’s dust behind.\n\nMen come and go, each watching each,\nHearts calculating, each with cause to preach.\nThree Lights shine clear beyond the dust’s veil,\nRevealing form—yet all is dust’s pale tale.\n\n**Reflections on the Water Cloud**\n\nI wandered west to lands afar,\nFound true gold—firm, unyielding star.\nSealed in the Vermilion Palace bright,\nIts glow illuminates, bathed in crimson light.\n\nThe Golden Elixir forms in instant grace,\nNo need for three years, nine transformations’ chase.\nIf peers could grasp this truth before the rest,\nIn Spicy Cloud’s depths, their path is blessed.\n\nAlone before the peak’s true face,\nJade blossoms, fair flowers—scenery’s embrace.\nOne grain of gold becomes the great elixir’s core,\nNo further need—no need to boil, no more.\n\nMysteries profound, yet simple to discern,\nSilent stillness holds the truth to learn.\nSearch out the truth from time’s first spark,\nNo south, no north—no east, no dark.\n\nMaster the true elixir by its name,\nUncover subtle truths—growth will claim.\nFrom then, the tortoise dives into the sea’s blue,\nFire peaks rejoice—Jú Láng’s joy anew.\n\nA true treasure’s light begins to glow,\nFour Symbols yield to Yang’s pure flow.\nFive-leafed golden lotus blooms in splendor wide,\nTen thousand threads of jade unfold with pride.\n\nBefore noon, after child—now clash they meet,\nSeizing golden essence, victory’s feat.\nA mortal head falls swift beneath the blade,\nLifted high—joy to Ding Gong’s aid.\n\nOne golden lotus blooms from birth’s first dawn,\nOnly the sage’s eye may guess its dawn.\nDraw in its scent, take it as your feast,\nMerge the Two Qi—conception’s feast.\n\nTen thousand spirits, sharp and keen,\nDefeat a thousand evils—no need for a guest.\nAlone, its light shines bright as day’s own glow,\nNow known—this place holds pearls of show.\n\nOn Jade Peak, I pluck the spirit mushroom fair,\nVital qi and spirit—rooted there.\nOne point of light, yet radiant bright,\nFive hues of mist entwine in pure delight.\n\nIn stillness, pierce the Five Phases’ cause,\nThus cast off the Four False forms’ embrace.\nReturn to origin—true face revealed,\nWhite clouds ride steady—one immortal steeled.\n\nThe Four False forms now guests to me,\nThe True within—my ancient kin.\nAlone on Three Peaks, who shares my seat?\nClear wind and moon—my three companions meet.\n\nWho dares wield sword or spear with pride?\nDragon and tiger clash—yet I stand defied.\nSeizing the Light-Pearl, one bright gleam,\nDissolves the frost of nine cold winters’ dream.\n\nBeneath White Cloud Hall, the night grows deep,\nFine rain and bells—golden drops weep.\nDrink deep from Penglai’s cup, I sing,\nSlow, the phoenix flute’s sad, sweet ring.\n\nIn practice, first discern what’s true, what’s false,\nSouth, north, east, west—all paths compose.\nWater, fire, wood, metal—none need be,\nOne Light-Pearl gleams from the center’s key.\n\nInner vision finds its kindred soul,\nOn Moonlit Peak, I sing at will.\nTen thousand verses—who can fathom?\nIf understood, the heart grows still.\n\nThe Purple Spirit Mushroom’s shell first sprouts,\nPlucked, then boiled—its virtue brooks.\nJade nectar, fair wine—now mixed with grace,\nSwallowed whole—eternal life’s embrace.\n\nSince I’ve won gold from water’s deep,\nI’ve used the knife to sever all that’s steep.\nOne jade flower blooms toward the sun’s bright face,\nCrystalline Yang reflects the Heaven’s place.\n\nThe Horse-Ape’s caught—now practice’s done,\nAll things perish—none are born, none run.\nWould you strike the drum on painted towers high?\nAt dawn, why ring the metal’s chime so nigh?\n\nIf you would master the elixir’s art,\nPreserve the true spirit—keep it whole and pure.\nLook upon Kunlun’s mountain’s grand display,\nSpicy Cloud’s glow meets Qin’s vast way.\n\nSurname Wang, given name Zhé, style Ming,\nDao name Chongyang—four flavors sing.\nOne nature easily harmed by wind’s deceit,\nA thousand gold won’t buy a high sleep’s retreat.\n\nNow I’ve torn the net of iron true,\nToday I leap from dust’s confining hue.\nWith bright moon’s light, I play my part,\nScattering clouds—good sport to mar the wind’s art.\n\nMysteries deep, yet logic’s thread is spun,\nFrost of silver’s gone—my heart’s undone.\nRide the Iron Ox to plow the Steward’s land,\nIn every plot, gold grains take their stand.\n\nDo not covet rebirth’s fleeting shell,\nPlant in the Jade Pool—let roots compel.\nA white lotus blooms, its scent so clear,\nPierces the Heaven’s heights—no need to fear.\n\nTrue cultivation’s ease, not hard to know,\nDao’s use in observing Heaven’s flow.\nClaim the Two Peaks’ true, boundless realm,\nWang’s flower’s core—its cause is warm.\n\nWithin the Jade Pool, yellow buds unfold,\nJade petals, gold branches—flowers of gold.\nEach bloom, clear and bright, its qi ascends,\nChimes and bells—our family’s ends.\n\nA lifetime’s purity nourishes the Three Fields,\nNow stillness may be rightly heeded.\nThe bright pearl returns to the mountain’s crest,\nClouds and mists bear it to the Great Dao’s rest.\n\nThough you seek echoes beyond the void,\nOr chase the bubbles in the water’s ploy,\nA thousand schemes, a hundred turns of fate—\nHow can you escape this final state?\n\nDo not become a ghost in your hometown’s dust,\nSoon I’ll return—a celestial guest.\n\nThis natural knows its own retreat—no need to search,\nThat subtle essence, then, must be studied with care.\nCall forth the Primordial Child to examine closely,\nLuminous and refined, the Purple-Gold Elixir forms.\n\nBright and flawless, its marvels none can compare,\nFive paths’ radiance gathered as one.\nClothed in white linen, it struggles in water’s embrace,\nOr wrapped in green silk, it marches through flames.\n\nFour flavors blend into one, everlasting and sweet,\nEndless life is thus attained.\nOnly those who know how to nurture the Purple-Gold Elixir,\nRefine it into a pearl—then will it not be hard.\n\nIts light shines forth, ever more splendid,\nAll hues of the cosmos gathered at once.\nJade nectar flows, yet none may recognize,\nPearl broth surges, yet who can know its source?\n\nNow I alone irrigate the Golden Flower Tree,\nIts fragrant scent fills the Four Quarters.\nOnly I can eat the flesh of the Azure Crane,\nOnly I can feast on the White Horse’s liver.\n\nTwo stages merge into one, all else falls away,\nOnlookers shrink in fear at the sight.\nSuddenly seizing this Primordial Essence,\nIllusion dissolves—its nature is not mine.\n\nOne radiant light, utterly clear,\nFive colors vibrant, as I will.\nMercury and lead meet on the long road,\nLife and vitality forever secure.\n\nStirring the water and fire’s vital breath,\nParting the smoke and flames to point to the lake.\nSweet water quells the diagram’s chaos—\nWho knows the harm of the **Harmful Wind** in the **Final Southern**?\nThe **Chang’an** streets hold no sway over West or East.\n\nFrom time to time, I raise my head to the **Storied Seas**,\nReeling in the **Whale and Giant Turtle**—yet they are not the true heroes.\n\nAgain I know: **One Wheel of Moonlight, One Clear Wind**,\nInner and outer harmonize—West returns to East.\nA single form emerges from **Kunlun’s** peak,\nShining bright, its breeze crisp—now it stands as the true hero.\n\n**To Master Qiu Chuji**\nFine golden scales play in emerald currents,\nSeeking fragrant bait, it swallows the hook.\nGently I reel in its luminous threads,\nDragging it to **Penglai’s** eternal freedom.\n\n**To Master Sang’s Son**\nMaster Sang’s accumulated virtue is profound and vast,\nThis child of his understands all matters.\nSlightly awakened to inner joy, not external delight,\nHe seeks the moonlight, playing with the clear wind.\n\n**To Master Tang Gong on Seeking the Dao**\nTrue cultivation must not follow worldly desires,\nFor following them, the Dao cannot be realized.\nServing the same current as others, yet none awaken—\nOnly when the heart truly understands is the path revealed.\n\nSeeking the Dao and refining the True Nature is no hasty affair,\nEver sweeping the heart-field clear.\nAwakening to transcendence lies in severing dusty attachments,\nIf Heaven had sentiment, Heaven too would age.\n\n**To the Scholars**\nAll you gentlemen here possess noble talent,\nBoth sharp and bright, your Dao-eyes open wide.\nDo not be ensnared by fame and gain,\nInstead, follow me to **Penglai’s** gate.\n\n**To Ninghai Begging for Paper and Banners**\nThe **Harmful Wind**’s man asks what proof he has,\nAll techniques and methods are useless—he cannot.\nDaily deeds are but this alone:\nEat above, ascend below.\n\n**To Master Ma Yu of Dengzhou**\nSpeak of the Moon’s brilliance, its light radiant,\nFragrance from the **Cassia Tree** spreads nineteen branches.\nAt the **Midnight Hour**, when the **True North** aligns,\nUnleash its spirit-luster to illuminate the **Jade Pool**.\n\n**To Master Ma Yu**\nMaster, you once wrote this poem in **Shaanxi**,\nWhen you reached **Ninghai’s** military encampment,\nWe met for the first time—now I inscribe your name again as a gift.\nOne farewell at **Final Southern’s** **Water Bamboo Village**,\nYour home lacks sons, daughters, or grandchildren.\nA thousand leagues away, I seek my true friend,\nGuiding you to the **Gate of Immortality**.\n\n**Self-Portrait as a Skull**\nThis was the **Harmful Wind** of my past life,\nWhy does he now wander West and East?\nLet him roam as a skull in the wilderness,\nFree in the moonlit void, his true nature revealed.\n\n**To Master Huang Ge**\nGather wisdom-grass and add broad oil,\nA single bright lamp atop his head.\nIlluminating the **Five Gates**, all paths are clear,\nTeaching him to clap hands in endless joy.\n\n**To Master Sun Ergong**\n(No direct translation, as the name appears to be a title rather than a personal one.)\n\n**To Master Sun Ergong**\nYour Second Aunt is kin to my **Harmful Wind** household—\nOnce, the Master twice split a pear to share,\nFeeding it to husband and wife, intending both to transform.\nA year after my **taking the Way (出家奉道)**, Sun’s family also embraced the Dao.\nThe pear was split ten times for transformation last year—\nThe heavens granted a fine hour, the Master’s natural virtue.\n\nWhy did you not then **leave the home**?\nAh, you waited only for the **Golden Lotus (金莲)** to be bound.\nAt home, they called you merely \"Second Aunt (二婆)\",\nBut once outside, the **fire of home (家火)** was extinguished.\nLeaping into white clouds, you transcended the **Sea of Suffering (苦海)**,\nNow I call you **Xianma (仙姑)** in endless joy.\n\n---\n\n**The Impermanence Bell (无常钟)**\nThe bell rings not by time—yet those who hear it grieve.\nThey know the world must now **rest (休)**.\nIts few chimes follow the setting sun,\nSilent guests nod in wordless farewell.\n\n---\n\n**To Master Feng (冯先生)**\nA hundred years of light and shadow pass without return—\nTurn back, and you’ll see the **mist of illusion (迷蒙)**.\nI teach you to recognize the **upside-down (颠倒)** in the scene,\nTo crush the dust of **mundane particles (微尘)** and trample **void (空)**.\n\n---\n\n**The Perfect Form (圆相)**\nOne perfect round form, I know it well—\nAt this hour, **Master Wang Zhe (王哲)** is right.\nHe emerges from the peak of

**recite these verses (引动君吟)**?\n\n---\n\n**Inscribed on the Moon Bay Tree at Pure Business Temple (题净业寺月桂)**\nWho would plant this **moon bay tree (月桂)** in the earth?\nHow could it bear to open its blossoms to the **mundane and vulgar (尘凡)**?\nI pluck a single branch in my hand,\nThen take the **celestial seed (仙种)** to **Penglai (蓬莱)**.\n\n---\n\n**Seven-Character Absolute Poems with Hidden

黄莺儿」\n*Composed by Chongyangzi Wang Zhe of Zhongnan Mountain*\n*Lyrics to the tune of \"Huang Ying Er\"*\n\nHow lamentable is the floating world’s way of passing through!\nWine and lust entangle like vines,\nWealth and **qi** sink deep like buried treasure—\nAll mortals follow these paths,\nFour evils binding them tightly.\n\nFrom high to higher rises their splendor,\nEach step breeds deeper confusion.\nAll boast of cleverness and cunning,\nEach strives to outwit the other—\nAll entangled in greed and jealousy.\n\nFrom ancient times to modern,\nHow few turn back in time,\nWilling to take **Dao** as their master.\n\nEven if one follows the **monkeys and horses**,\nTheir schemes are ever in disarray—\nNo way to grasp the lineage of the ancestors.\n\nOnly by turning into the barren cliffs,\nBy plunging into the depths of the earth,\nDoes one await the final hour’s approach—\nYet still cannot escape the Three **Avīci**’s torments.\n\nThe heart’s true nature is the master of cultivation.\nRefine the **golden elixir** (金丹),\nLet the **essence and fluids** (津液) flow and merge,\nPouring over the rootless—\nNurturing the **jewel-tree** (琼树) with sprouts.\n\nEver watering the **jade-branches** (瑶枝),\nWhispering through the dense leaves—\nThe **Huang Ying**’s melodious voice.\n\nThe **resplendent and refined** (莹灵) sounds and tones,\nThe bright eyes gazing—\nNow the **baby** rides the **Tiger** (骑虎),\nThe **Fu** phase (兑方) has arrived.\n\nHow wondrous—\nThe **maiden** astride the **Azure Dragon** (青龙),\nFour souls united in departure.\n\nFrom the **original essence** (元初),\nFirst attained—**stillness** (静) wraps **radiance** (辉),\nThe **returning light** (回光) makes the **embryonic immortal** (胎仙) dance.\n\nIt should emerge, manifesting on **Kunlun**,\nRestoring the **Penglai** abode.\n\nI do not presume to fancy clouds and mist,\nFor the **luan and he** birds (鸾鹤) come naturally.\n\nThe **flower-heart stirs**—\nLock tight the **heart-monkey** (心猿),\nAwaken to the **light** (光) of time—\nThe dusty, mortal span is left behind.\n\nBegin cultivation with decisive action,\nReturn to the **original essence** (元本),\nThis day to discard the **corporeal prison** (骸屋).\n\nFirst leap from the **domestic pit and trench** (坑堑),\nThen abandon the body—\nAlone, one finds the **host** (孤宿).\n\nIn **stillness** without disturbance,\n**Qi**, wealth, lust, and wine—\nAll swept away, utterly expelled.\n\nThe **mundane sights** (俗景) vanish one by one,\nDesire extinguished.\n\nOne must forsake even **parents, spouse, and kin** (爷娘共妻骨肉),\nTo attain **freedom** (自在) and **ease** (逍遥),\nFalling into **detachment** (落魄) and **leisure** (清闲),\nRecognizing the **jewel within the wrapped head** (裹头金玉).\n\nThe **jewel-petals** (琼英) and **jade-buds** (瑶蕊),\nThe **flower-heart stirs**—\nReleasing fragrance to fill the air,\nA scent of **auspicious radiance** (祥辉) clustering in the **Nine Curves** (九曲).\n\n**Yutang Chun** (玉堂春)\nCultivation attained—\nSwift paths open before one.\n\nBoth **child and parent phases** (子午) are transcended,\nWhy cling to **Zao and You** (卯酉)?\n\nOnly the **two treasures** (两珍) suffice—\nThe rest may be left to guard each other.\n\nLet **lead and mercury** (铅汞) be guided to form the **sphere** (球).\nThen the **elixir** (丹) is perfected—\nAll phases revealed, utterly transparent.\n\nAlign the **true wind** (真风),\nName spreads, undying.\n\nSearch out the **original essence** (元初),\nWho else would be the true companion?\nOnly now does one know the **piercing truth** (彻头).\n\nAgain—\n**Lock the door.** (锁门)\n\n「Jade’s nature is true gold’s essence,\nAll may transform—**this is the Way**.\n\nJade nectar, gold **elixir**—\nEver welcoming, again and again.\n\nJade hare, gold crow—\nTheir luminous **qi** ranks second only to the sun.\nShining upon jade railings, sprouting jade shoots.\n\n**Jade-buds**, gold stalks—\nEver flourishing, never withering.\nJade maidens, gold boys—\nEver seen, yet never lingering.\n\nJade locks, gold keys—\nEvery door opens beneath.\nPraise **Yutang Chun** and **Jade Flower** together.\n\nThere is a **Kingly Wind**—\nOften sleeping, often resting.\nNo dreams, no wakefulness,\nNo calamities, no misfortunes.\n\nWhite tiger, green dragon—\nNaturally mating in harmony.\nWater and fire meet—\nAbove and below, in perfect balance.\nThis **cause and effect**—\nTruly the **original meditation** (打坐).\nLet me ask all **adepts**—\nDo you still recognize it?\n\nLike me in **cultivation**,\nGain your **merit**

**clarity**—\nEach reveals their **true nature**.\nTwo by two in **Daoic practice**—\nYou, each one, reflect upon the heart.\n**Void and substance**, **false and true**—\nWrap the face in warmth and coolness,\nSeek **freedom**, find **ease**.\nGradually return to **meditative stillness**.\nTeach and command—\nEach must heed.\n\nSwiftly climb the high slope,\nThen steadily seek **the quickened path**.\n**Mystic and profound**, **wondrous and subtle**—\nCarefully discern the **Heavenly Way** (天衢),\nWalk upright, stand firm.\nEach step blooms **lotus in unison**.\n\n---\nAgain—\n*Seeking a

waters**.\n\nSleep at will, rest as you please,\nBreathing—**rarely heard**—\nMastering **qi**, swallowing **celestial vapors**,\nAt ease in endless play.\n**Auspicious radiance**, **marvelous hues**—\nEntering and emerging, **true omens** manifest.\n\nFlames blaze fiercely,\nThen walk **through the midst**, seizing **benefit**.\nBurn and scorch at will,\nSwiftly gather **coolness**—\nDrag your tail, shake your head,\nAlone upon the **white lotus’s core**.\n\n---\n**Riding Through the Imperial Avenue**\n**Jade Herb**, a single **elixir**—\n**Daoic communion** for **sages and worthies**.\n\n**The Elixir of True Spirit-Nature**\n\nThis medicine cures **true spirit-nature**—\nIn the **void-mortar’s** steadfast array,\nWith **Diamond Pestle**, ground to **luminous essence**.\n**Mahāprajñā** honey mixed in,\nRefined until **pills** are formed.\n**Great Compassion Thousand-Armed** elixir perfected,\n**Sunfire** simmered—**cooked to completion**.\nBest taken with **yellow sprouts**,\n**Eight Immortal Waters** brewed pure.\nFrom this moment, **eternal life** is attained—\n**Everlasting success** secured.\n\n**Flickering Candle Shadows**\nFlickering candle shadows, red—\nDarkly hanging **pearl-tears**, like whispered speech.\n**Unfeeling things** stir no cause,\nYet turn my frequent **awakenings**.\nWhy fret, dear one?\n**Today**, at **Zhongnan**, we meet.\nOpen your eyes, steady your mind,\nEastward to the **Jade Path**.\n**True stillness**—**cloud-walking** through **celestial steps**.\nAt the **ocean’s edge**, our rendezvous awaits—\nHere, we may dwell.\nAwaiting **the Radiant Master**,\nUnfolding **mysteries of eternal life’s gate**.\nWrapped in **rainbow light**,\n**Penglai** reveals itself—\nTogether, we return.\n\n**Eight-Voice Sweet

singing *Manting Hua* in harmony.\n\n**Desiring to Leave the Household**\nIf one seeks to practice,\nUltimate stillness must be attained—\nFree from dust and worldly clamor.\n\nDo not rely on external seats,\nMorning and evening, stir the heart’s incense.\nMust one diminish wife and abandon affairs,\nLeave kin and homeland,\nOnly then does one return to the One.\n\nWhen the people are at ease, the nation prospers,\nVictory in war and strength in arms.\nEnduringly, with ease,\nSeek the profound mysteries,\nRecognize the coolness of detachment.\n\nYet the Dao is boundless and formless—\nOnly in

infant.\n\n**The Jade Flower Society of Wen Deng’s Zhang and Shao**\nMaster Wang’s legacy remains,\nThe Jade Flower Society convened—\nThis was for Zhang the Lord.\n\nThen came the Shao clan,\nTheir halls unbuilt, neglected.\nAll now regret, awakening fiercely—\nThe hare rises, casting aside the clay ball.\nDo they not know?\nA broken string cannot be mended,\nSpilled water cannot be retrieved.\n\nCease, cease—\nEach to their own path,\nThough I linger with affection,\nI shall not turn back.\n\nMay all noble hearts remember,\nIn shared currents of the Dao.\nParting thoughts already stir—\nGolden lotus seeds,\nTheir light fills the Western State.\n\nI must return to Wen Deng’s triumphant scene,\nNo longer to revisit.\n\n**West River Moon**\nNurturing the *Jia* cannot compare to cultivating nature,\nRefining the body cannot match refining the heart.\nFrom beginning to now, all this striving—\nEach day’s labor, what does it truly gain?\n\nSeek the subtle mysteries,\nThen ponder the profound principles.\nA friend who glimpses gold in water\nWould not wander in barren fields in vain.\n\n**Recalling the Wandering Prince**\nThey say the mouth is the gate of calamity,\nI say the tongue is its root.\nSilence is better than idle speech.\nMeasure dawn and dusk—\nThen one preserves life in tranquil ease.\n\n**Su Mu Zha**\nFew bother me, seldom do they gather.\nI have no favors to bestow—\nDo not blame others for their indifference.\nWith virtue and frugality, my heart is at ease.\n\n□[Do not] seek their company,\nFor rabbits often linger in debt’s embrace.\nWhen wealth is plentiful,\nAll flock to show their affection.\nBut when money is gone,\nEven kin grow cold and distant.\nSee how the world’s emotions shift so swiftly—\nI have fathomed human hearts,\nYet find no remedy beyond this.\n\n**Golden Rooster’s Call**\nA warning to Master Liu:\nI seize the empty void—\nGraceful and refined, peerless in elegance.\nProfound within profound,\nWondrous beyond all wondrous.\nNaturally, five hues radiate with spirit’s glow.\nA single luminous pearl,\nEnvelops in a thousand threads of dawn’s blush.\nPure and clear, cool and bright,\nDim and silent, shadowy and elusive.\nAll things in the cosmos gleam with splendor.\nMoon wraps the hare’s cry,\nSun wraps the golden rooster’s call.\n\n**Recalling Old Friends in Peach Springs**\nOn the tortoiseshell branch, jade blossoms gleam,\nAnd coral buds form in secret.\nThe dark jade leaves are my delight—\nWhich of the four can truly compare?\nIn stillness, I recognize the true treasure,\nIts brilliance no mere trifle.\nOnly one knows it for what it is,\nTogether we return to the **Penglai Isle**.*[^1]\n\n---\n*[^1]: **Penglai Isle** (蓬莱岛) – One of the Three Isles of

far—\nDrifting, drifting,\nPiercing through the azure void to true freedom.\n\n**Admonishing Those Who Pay Homage**\nHow pitiful these stubborn men!\nWasting strength in crude, futile toil.\nFive limbs prostrate to the earth—\nFoolishly, still laboring over this borrowed flesh.\nThe Dao is fundamentally empty and boundless.\nMysterious within, concealing mysteries beyond measure.\nWithin lies the primal light—yet none perceive it.\nOnly I, day by day, observe and breathe it in.\n\nNo longer chasing after all things.\nWaving away, I walk—all matters cease.\nTurning back to behold my true form,\nCarefree, unbound—where is there sorrow?\nBoarding this great divine vessel,\nJade oars and pearl buckets crossing the current.\nSurging past the raging waves, all obstacles vanish—\nStrategy now—soaring above the Ten Isles and Three Isles.\n\n**To Master Yu on Illusory Transformation**\nIllusory forms swirl about.\nLightning’s afterglow ripples on the water’s surface.\nSudden presence, sudden absence—swift as the wind,\nLike a storm—\nA white steed fleeting past the blink of an eye.\n\nWhy not awaken from this empty delusion?\nTurn early to nurture the jade sprout.\nOn it, the golden elixir shines radiant—\nManifest, piercing through the cloudy paths into the emerald sky.\n\n**To Master Shao on Beginning Practice**\nMy fate is not dictated by Heaven;\nPlow the Three Fields with skill, guarding the wondrous mystery.\nSweet rain deepens first—planting the seeds,\nGold coins scattered—\nEverywhere, the yellow sprouts bloom most vividly.\nCultivate the jade lotus—\nEach leaf distinct, forever firm.\nPearl medicine stirred by the wind,\nFragrance spreading—a single luminous thread, natural and free.\n\n**On the Wind Chime**\nThe master’s hand delights in new creation.\n\n**The Sixteen-String Zither**\n\nSixteen strings—each with its own name,\nHanging in the Palace of the Clouds beyond mortal paths,\nThe wind greets them—\nThen they willingly summon their own resonance.\nNot bound by the common, but heard in the profound.\nSeizing the celestial melody to expound the **Dao** scriptures,\nOnly beside me do all listen with perfect clarity—\nChiding, I lead you to **Penglai** within the Jade Court.\n\n*Master Xiao* laments the calf that fails to call its mother.\nIts nature is like rushing waters—\nSwift, the emerald waves flow.\nIt knows only sweet milk to make balm and oil,\nEver following its mother, wagging its tail, shaking its head.\nInto the stream it plunges, then the ravine—\nGradually, it runs wild with no restraint.\nGalloping through valleys, untamed by bridle, it follows its own will.\nChasing fragrant grasses, how could it know the woes of tigers and wolves?\nWorthy of lament—this calf of the world!\n\nThe **Dragon Gate** ox stands firm,\nGalloping with the wind’s flow.\nIts body smooth as ink, supple as oil,\nCharging boldly—dragged back, it turns no head.\nWhen will this suffering cease?\nIts sinews strained to exhaustion, it lies in the ditch.\nWithout cause, it is reviled by men.\nLike idle water grass, it cannot escape a single blade’s woe.\n\n**The Wind Chime (Sguazo Society)**\nThe Sguazo Society’s wind chime—\nThis wind chime is the music of the **Dao** Immortals.\nSeeing a spirit child, within it so bright and graceful,\nNaturally it can play in harmony.\nLong strings gleam with jade pendants,\nA golden flower blooms upon its head, radiant—\nThen it sets the Five Directions leaping in rhythm.\nAt dawn, it lifts its cloud-treading feet,\nAt dawn, it lifts its cloud-treading feet.\nIn its ecstatic dance, the true joy is perfect.\nRevealing its delicate intricacies—\nClear, resonant, adorned with tinkling ornaments—\nIt draws down the **Luan** cranes and **He** herons,\nWelcoming and sending them in endless flight, together they swirl,\nAnd together they dance, radiating the Nine **Danyao** lights.\nOn the **Penglai** path, there are vows to be kept,\nOn the **Penglai** path,

West.\n\nThe heart ascends, fire surges—\nLost in the *Sāntián* [Three Fields]’s *táng* [sugar] and honey.\n\nFire surges, the heart ascends—\nThe wheel of transmigration turns again.\n\nThe spirit is clear, the *qi* is refreshed,\nRevelry in the tranquil—\nWorthy of a single song.\n\nThe *qi* refreshed, the spirit clear—\nDrumming out the voice from my origins.\n\nSpirit clear, *qi* refreshed,\nNurturing the *huángyá* [yellow sprout]’s fate—\nAiding its growth.\n\n*Qi* refreshed, spirit clear—\nRecognizing the path ahead,\nIts true essence.\n\n---\n\n*A Gift to Wang’s Drinking House*—\nCool broth must be prepared,\nWith skilled hands rolling it like snow in one’s grasp.\n\nThe broth prepared and cool,\nJade petals swirl into the precious pot.\n\nSliced finely with the knife,\nIn the bowl—silver threads and jade shavings.\n\nFinely sliced with the knife,\nFurther divided—\nThe *bìtáo* [plum]’s green hues.\n\n---\n\n*Transforming Ragged Silk*—\nLong dwelling by the sea,\nA robe of silk is not needed for warmth.\n\nBy the sea, long dwelling,\nThe mortal frame’s nature is naturally temperate.\n\nI pray for your care,\nTurning many into one for praise.\n\nPraise for your care,\nNurturing the *xiān tāi* [immortal embryo],\nGranting ease and expansion.\n\n---\n\n*Wandering Waves*—\nA poem for the *Táng Xiùcái* [Tang Scholar] seeking *Chūn* [Spring]’s chill and *Qiū* [Autumn]’s heat.\n\n**《气色》**\nQi’s hues clash in ceaseless interplay—\nFour seasons blend without distinction.\nAbove congeals, below emits—\nTwo forces grind in mutual friction.\n\nWarmth deceives cold, cold presses warmth,\nTheir shifts resist all firm decree.\nLike fleeting splendor, men pursue their fate—\nGaining warmth, they court the baneful chill.\n\nWealth and poverty, heat and cold—\nAll shift like waves in sand’s embrace.\nHarmonious qi seeks to ascend,\nYet cold’s dark weight drags it down.\nCool clarity within may yet surge,\nBut outer flames suppress its flight—\nSpring’s chill, autumn’s stifling steam.\n\nYin ascends, yang surges bright,\nYang delights, yin swells in turn.\nMen boast their strength at life’s decline—\nHeaven darkens just before the dawn,\nFate and fortune intertwine.\n\n---\n**《叹虚》**\n*Oh, the Void’s ethereal drift!*\nStone-fire spares no fleeting spark,\nLightning wraps in flame’s fierce burn.\nA hundred years—like bubbles burst\nIn water’s grasp. Life’s flash and fade,\nLike wind-torches, burns too fast.\n\nYou dwell in vain, in worldly dust—\nAwaken! Seize the hollow bloom.\nWith wisdom’s lamp, dispel the oil of fate.\nIts radiance burns eternal, bright and clear,\nReflecting back the sacred sprouts.\n\nMen must grasp the golden seed—\nYet cling to fleeting, gaudy bloom.\nThe mundane, once transcended, becomes the Dao.\nAll things, once touched, dissolve—\nWhat need for infantile delight?\n\nPenglai’s glow shines through mist and haze,\nEmerald vapors, crimson clouds.\nIn the Ever-Spring Garden, sacred blossoms bloom.\nThough veiled in dimness, light remains—\nCease your boasts, and rest in stillness.\n*Mùshān’s* stream winds on.\n\n---\n\n**玉堂三老**\nThe Three Elders of Jade Hall,\nOnly Master Wáng Sān cāo knows.\n\n**复许辨三台**\nHe can discern the Three Platforms,\nAnd further, nourish the Three Fields with ease.\n\n**更能润、三田倚靠**\nMoistening them, leaning on their support,\n**自然三耀**—the Three Radiances arise.\n\n**攒聚气神精，运三车**\nGathering *qi*, spirit, and essence,\nHe drives the Three Vehicles.\n\n**依三教，永没沈三道**\nFollowing the Three Teachings,\nHe sinks forever into the Three Ways.\n\n**须通三宝，方见三清好**\nOnly when he masters the Three Treasures\nDoes he behold the Three Pure Ones’ splendor.\n\n**真性照三峰**\nHis true nature shines upon the Three Peaks,\n**陡兔了、三焦做造**—\nSwiftly, he dispels the Three Burners’ afflictions.\n\n**休论三世**\nDo not speak of the Three Worlds,\nFor all Buddhas appear before him now.\n\n**诸佛现前来，得三乘**\nHe attains the Three Vehicles,\n**游三昧，莹莹归三岛**\nWanders in the Three Meditations,\nAnd returns to the Three Isles in luminous grace.\n\n**修行学道，切莫凭婴姹**\nIn Dao cultivation, do not cling to youthful charm,\nFor these are but fleeting illusions.\n\n**只是这些儿，把尘俗、般般不惹**\nHe avoids all worldly dust—\nEvery trifle, he shuns.\n\n**自然萧索，寂寞与他依**\nThus, he dwells in serene desolation,\nIn quietude, aligned with emptiness.\n\n**餐残饭，着粗衣**\nFeasting on leftovers,\nWearing coarse robes—\n**饱暖休相舍**\nYet never forsaking fullness or warmth.\n\n**常从坦荡，守养身躯假**\nHe abides in boundless openness,\nNurturing his mortal form with steadfast care.\n\n**闲裹得真闲，觉清凉**\nIn idle ease, he finds true leisure,\nFeeling the cool, refreshing breeze—\n**惺惺洒洒**\nVigorous and bright.\n\n**暗中功行，直待两盈盈**\nIn hidden toil, his practice ripens,\nTill both *qi* and spirit brim full.\n\n**灵明显，做逍遥**\nThe spirit becomes clear and luminous,\nAnd he achieves boundless freedom—\n**师父看来也**\nAs the Master sees.\n\n**水中沤起，来往相随走**\nLike gold dredged from water’s depths,\nHe moves with the ebb and flow.\n\n**旋旋被风吹，便生灭**\nSwiftly, winds scatter him—\nLife and death arise in turn.\n\n**暂无还有**\nFor a moment, he lingers—\n**忽亡忽聚，遄速没人知**\nThen vanishes or gathers, unseen by any.\n\n**如浮世，不坚牢**\nLike this transient world,\nHe is not steadfast.\n\n**名利难长久**\nGains and glory fade too soon.\n\n**诸公早悟，休要迷花酒**\nAll noble ones, awaken early!\nDo not be ensnared by beauty’s fleeting allure.\n\n**养聚气和神，更认取、三光灵秀**\nNourish *qi* and spirit in harmony,\nAnd know the Three Lights’ refined essence—\n**朝昏调摄**\nBalancing them at dawn and dusk,\n**保护结金丹**\nGuard them to forge the Golden Elixir.\n\n**添真莹，放明光**\nAugmenting true clarity,\nHe emits bright radiance—\n**永得逍遥寿**\nAnd attains eternal, carefree life.\n\n---\n\n**赠刘哥会剃头面**\n*To Brother Liú, Master of Hair-Trimming*\n\n**公能力镊**\nYour skill with the tweezers is unmatched—\n**将彼姿颜接**\nYou pluck those features with

meal,\nBeneath the moonlit *guìhuā* tree.\n\n**凌晨静至乐倍**\nAt dawn’s approach, the stillness doubles my delight,\n**倚栏隈，观奇材**\nLeaning on the railing,\nI behold its marvelous form.\n\n**正是蟾宫余影世间来**\nThe moon’s last light descends—\n**遂得睛空甘露力**\nI gain the void’s nectar,\n**润根荄，发修条，伟又瑰**\nMoistening its roots,\nUnfurling its branches—\nHow grand and rare!\n\n**能绽粉苞加红艳**\nIt bursts with pink petals,\n**按周天，四序开**\nFollowing the cosmic cycle,\nBlooming through all seasons—\n**蕊撒黄金，腾馥郁、道眼堪猜**\nIts stamens scatter gold,\nIts fragrance ascends—\nA sight for Daoist eyes alone.\n\n**岂许姿陆地、混尘埃**\nWho would allow such grace\nTo be buried in earthly dust?\n**呼取好风同引去**\nI summon the finest breeze,\n**上瑶台，复灵根，月裹栽**\nTo lift it to the Celestial Terrace,\nWhere its spirit thrives—\nPlanted in moonlight.\n\n「When one recognizes the wondrous Dao of the rare and distant *Xīyí* realm,\nIt is naturally—\nA state of **no vexation, no sorrow**.\n\nWife, son, grandson, granddaughter,\nAll entangled in endless affection.\n\nYet bound by *yù* (prison) and *yīn* (mountain of debt),\nI clutch my body tightly—\nSeized and held fast.\n\nIf one seeks to refine oneself into such **playful perfection**,\nOne must **wield the wisdom-blade**—\nSharpen it often,\nAnd strike it repeatedly.\n\nEven a **ten-thousand-catín iron chain** will shatter.\n\nI pay tribute to Master Liú,\nAnd awaken to my own **golden rooster’s call**.\n\n**Grateful for the Sovereign’s Grace**—\nIn the tenth month of *Dīnghài* (1747), the Master wished to transform *Mǎ Yuè* (Horse Moon),\nSo for a hundred days he sealed the gate,\nDesiring that *Yuè* witness the family’s **Daoist discipline** and thus comply.\n\nA hundred days the gate of the *ān* (hermitage) was sealed,\n*Mǎ Yuè* was taken and bound—\nIn the tranquil stillness,\nBoth true and false *qi* were cultivated.\n\nI alone sigh and ponder,\n**How such ease could be attained.**\n\nMy kin know well,\n**How pure and refined** it is.\n\nThere is another kind—\n**Distinct and clear like fine art**,\nAgain and again I lift it forth,\nTemporarily to hang.\n\nTo behold it fully,\nOne must pay a **price of ten-thousand *hú* (斛) of pearls**.\n\nAt that time, I would pass it down—\nA few words.\n\n**The *Ruì* (auspicious) *Zhì* (crane)**—\nIn *Chángchūn* (Eternal Spring), the scenery lasts forever,\nIn the **land of eternal night**,\nIt never sleeps.\n\n**At ease and unhurried**, except for my own thoughts,\n**Roaming freely**, who could restrain it?\n\nOnly knowing **beyond the world is the world itself**,\n**Gazing within the heavens reveals another heaven**.\n\n**Five-colored clouds** forever as its companion,\n**Golden flowers** encircle the *Dàluótiān* (Great Lotus Heaven).\n\n**Do not refine the outward form**—\nOnly **kindle the crimson heart within**.\n\nFrom this point, one may **generate fire from wood**,\nNaturally **nurturing gold from water**.\n\n**The *Yáo* (jewel) *Fāng* (fragrance) tree** and its kindred guard,\n**Jade leaves and gem branches** intertwine.\n\n**Do not seek companions elsewhere**,\nFor **this alone is the true resonant voice**.\n\nWhich **Daoist cultivation** is refining the **gold elixir**?\nOnly when refined does one **know the two affairs are complete**.\n\n**Seven returns** must not open the **four gates**,\n**Nine rounds** should turn the **three fields**.\n\n**Qi and spirit** intertwined form the treasure,\n**Luminous nature** clearly reveals the **Great Sage**.\n\nToday, it returns to its **origin’s path**,\nNaturally **pure and tranquil** forevermore.\n\n**Lamenting the Yellow Flower**—\nYesterday, drunk with wine,\nI was bound at the elbow.\n\nOn the bridge,\nI fell into a **sudden downpour**—\n**Mocking laughter**.\n\nNo one to help me,\nWife and children **none would save**.\n\nI awaken suddenly—\n**My kin have cursed themselves.**\n\n**The Unattached Youth**\nThe willow droops in vain for me,\nThe blossoms bloom for none but her.\nMy wife—oh, my wife—\nA painted dog of false pretence.\nI guard the dike with care,\nLest it breach and spill my breath.\nThat wretch, Wang San,\nShould never walk this path again.\n\nWhen the bean leaves turn yellow,\nI’ll repay the worthy and brave—\nLet them leave this world soon.\n\nThe **Lingjing** landscape is pure,\nCool and serene, a perfect dwelling.\nIt opens the **Gate of Eternal Life**.\nThen take up practice with true **virtue/power** and true **Daoist cultivation**,\nAnd the **Luminous Nature** will shine forth.\n\nThe maiden rides the dragon,\nThe babe straddles the tiger.\nThey trade **pearls and jade**,\nTossing them aside for fleeting gain.\nYet here is the realm of **free and easy ease**—\nA single **gold elixir** (*mingming jindan*), radiant as gold mirror and gold glow, gathered tight.\n\nThe **Sacred Gourd**—\nThis gourd holds **spirit/qi** divine.\nAwake and clear, **incandescent and lucid**,\nI grasp the **free and easy ease** true.\nWith **head and mouth** wrapped in its grace,\nI chant the **Daoist scriptures** without cease.\n\nI take the **good karmic causes**,\nAnd fill my belly with them.\nPure and clear, they turn to **purity’s flow**.\nWith **jade staff** in hand, where shall I go?\nI follow my **Master**—\n**Clouds and waters** mark my path.\n\n**The Foolish Guolang**\nSomeone asks: *\"How can one escape the heart of hatred and love?\"*\nThe deeper the hatred, the more it grows,\nThe more one loves, the greater the folly.\nBoth weigh on the mind—\nHow does one resolve them?\nWhen others rejoice, I take it as my own delight,\nWhen others suffer, I feel it as my own affliction.\nThe heart becomes a single mass—\nEach erodes the other.\n\nGuolang’s **sloth** (*màn*)\nDissolves the silver mist,\nSweet rain forming pearls of dew.\nHe summons the **Clear Wind**,\n**Qi and spirit** aiding him.\nThen he **invites the Order**—\nTo guard and follow close,\nTo treasure the **Three Fields** (*sān tián*),\nAnd gather the **Nine-turn elixir** (*jiǔ zhuàn língdān*).\n\nBefore the **Azure Void**,\nJade mushrooms and golden trees sprout in abundance.\nThe **Lingming Flowers** (*yáohuā*) bloom,\nFilling the sky with countless fragrance.\nThe **Luminous Blossoms** (*qióng yì*) unfold,\nTheir jade petals exhaling sweet perfume—\nRight in the midst of this scent,\nA single point of light resides.\n\n**Free and easy ease**—\nSerene and unrestrained, he walks.\nWith **spirit staff** in hand,\nHis wide sleeves sway at leisure.\nThe **colored clouds** swirl around,\nAnd distant fragrant breezes,\nWith emerald mists, coax him near.\nHe lifts his head—\nAnd suddenly beholds a **radiant vision**, ever more refined.\nSees the **Green Robes** half in the air,\nWaving him forward.\nHe calls to me: *\"Do not part—follow me!\"*\nAnd points to the **white clouds’ depths**,\nWhere **Daoist immortals** dwell.\n\n**The Deep Gratitude**\nMy **Master** once said:\nI once carried a **gourd of wine** from the **Sweet River**,\nHeading back to my **hermitage**,\nWhen I met a **Master** who asked:\n*\"Would you share your wine with one struck by the wind?\"*\nI gave it to him.\nThe **Master** drank it all,\nThen ordered me to fill the gourd with river water.\nI did so and gave it back.\nHe returned it to me,\nSaying I should drink.\nI drank—and it was **nectar of the Dao**.\n\nHow much wind-water was drunk?\nFrom this, the **mysteries of the Dao** were revealed.\nA **white linen robe** and **blue silk headband**,\nFitting him perfectly—truly **spirited**!\nNo need for a mirror to behold his face,\nFor all things are clear in his mind.\n\nIn dreams, he sees the **true self** beyond dreams,\nAnd thus is he **free and easy**, crossing to the **other shore**.\n\n---\n\n**Again—The Master’s Practice**\nHe stokes the furnace,\nBurning out the **cool and serene vision**,\nSeizing the **gale’s shadow**.\nLightly, he fills it with **free and easy ease**—\nThe **heart-moon** shines clear beyond the void.\n\nFrom the start, he **vows with clarity**,\nHeeding the **Celestial Decree**.\nA **Daoist chant** calls him—\nNow he may return to the **elixir’s celestial heights**.\n\n**Free and Easy Ease #3**\nIf one would **Daoist cultivation** seek,\nOne must **search with utmost care**.\nLock tight the **Golden Pass** and **Jade Gate**,\nLet **upper** and **lower** merge in harmony,\nTheir **positions** exchanged, **irrigating** and **nourishing**.\nThen comes the **afterbirth**—\nAwake and **lucid**, yet still they **guess and debate**.\n\nThey enter the **Azure Void**,\nAnd cast aside the **root and stalk**.\n**Radiance** gleams in the **silver mist’s realm**,\nFresh as **jade’s hue**,\nThe **true spirit** luminous and smooth.\nClear and pure, they **pierce the void**—\nFine as the **filaments of silk**.\n\nThey cast off the **muddy wine**,\nAnd drink the **transmitted clear water**.\nThis **taste**—\n**Fragrant, sweet, and truly divine**.\n\n---\n\n**Over the Towered Hall**\nNo trace of dross remains—\nThe **Five Gates** open, **irrigating** with **sharp clarity**.\nThe **Seven Treasures** flourish, the **Three Fields** nourished.\nWith **tenfold mastery**, **knife and pill** blend in secret.\nA **true crystal** forms—**radiant and resplendent**.\nOn **mountain peaks**, **wind and moon** invite transcendence.\n\n**Temporary Respite by the River**\nEach day’s practice is but fleeting—\nToday, **sudden ease** unfolds.\n**Yin and Yang** merge in **harmonious clusters**.\nLike **baby to maiden**, **tiger coiled with dragon entwined**,\nThe **Four Symbols** copulate, **spinning jade threads**,\nPiercing through the **Golden Elixir** in one stroke.\n**Natural brilliance** emerges from the **muddy sphere**.\nWords fail to capture—\nSilence speaks no fault.\n\n---\n**The Old Gourd Master’s Song**\n*(A gourd he carried, ever filled with wine)*\nThrough streets he wandered, day by day,\nWho knew this gourd’s **true worth**?\n**Fine wine** needs no purchase—\nDrunk daily, never empty.\n**Body’s work** now fully done,\n**Spirit** stays—**never parting**.\nWith staff in hand, he sails the **rivers and lakes**,\nA **boat of wind and moon**, **eternal clouds unfurled**.\n\n**Tying the Cloud-Waist #4**\n*(Self-Composed)*\nAt **Zhongnan’s peak**, **Zhongyang** stands—\n**True freedom**, most **free and easy**.\nWith **clear wind and bright moon** as constant companions,\n**Echoing spirits** call—\nBeyond the void, **refined**, **rich in resonance**.\nThe **Penglai path** is often trod,\nOnly to **visit ancient sages**—**Qing and Hao**.\n**Crimson clouds and emerald mists** gather thick,\nRiding the **light breeze**, **cloud-waist tied high**,\nAscending to the **Azure Heights**.\n\n**The Guest of Immortals**\nTo **cultivate** is to **search**—\nFor **true clarity**, **true stillness**, **true heart’s gain**.\nThis side **verdant**, that **snow-white**,\nA **blackened crown**, **crimson above**.\nTogether they dwell in **lapislazuli halls**,\n**Jade-petal flowers** folded in **celestial bloom**.\n**Jade Boys sing**, **Golden Boys clap**—\n**Heaven’s chosen**, **mountains their home**.\nThis **breakthrough**—\nFirst the **breakthrough**, then the **Guest of Immortals** revealed.\nTo **see through** is to **know through**—\nLook again, and **my belly splits open**.\nHow to **do**? Just **as it is**—\nWhy **nap at noon** like a fool?\nWhat’s said? What’s done?\n**Hidden in self**, **alone in practice**.\nThis **harmful wind**—\n**Heart already broken**, **no ordinary discipline**.\nNo **calamity**, no **misfortune**—\n**Seeking nothing**, **no ink-stained scholar’s toil**.\n**Great Immortals chant**, **True Ones respond**,\nIn the **Full Perfection Hall**, **no smoke nor flame**.\n**Worry-Free Child**, with **three companions**,\n**Sudden

cranes and phoenixes remain.\nWhite light in ten thousand rays springs from the garden,\nRed light, one point, burns at the center.\n\n---\n*End of Volume Seven of the Complete Authentic Words of

gold takes flight.\nBinding the Three Threes into treasures,\nDonning the Six Sixes’ six-chun robe.\nRiding the Phoenix, clutching the Mandarin Duck, crossing mist to return,\nDescending from heaven’s decree—no defiance.\nWith three thousand karmic ties fulfilled, all is exhausted,\nEight hundred deeds completed, dust is rare.\n\nTwelve months, the tapestry of fortune is complete,\nThe four seasons’ branches and leaves wither not.\nSee how fire draws water within,\nNaturally, water encases the furnace’s glow.\nDragon, Tiger, Tortoise, and Serpent align in breath,\nAll bones filled, standing in an instant.\nOne luminous pearl descends three times,\nThree evils vanish, all at once.\nHaving obtained the sacred talisman, all matters are at rest,\nA hundred grievances retreat—let others fret.\nDrink the elixir to fill my belly’s depths,\nPour the golden marrow to crown my head.\nAll for the Ten Causes that led to this path,\nMaqia and the infant dwell in intricate bonds.\nTeach me to grasp the three straight blades,\nAsk the Sage to recognize the single curved hook.\nThe crimson window’s distant five thousand words,\nTwo hundred characters—\nTwo kinds of hidden scriptures,\nDivine and marvelous deeds.\nWithin the numinous, I perceive the profound,\nPiercing the mystery, refining the gold elixir.\nObtaining the incandescent, all duality ceases.\nIn boundless

Guo Hai Chan* (燕國海蟾) as my elder guide,\n*Zhongnan Chongyangzi* (終南重陽) gathers disciples.\n\nAs disciples, we take refuge here,\nServing and honoring three masters, their sacred essence united.\nMove, and the Four Spirits (四靈) radiant in divine hues coalesce;\nStill, and the Ten Thousand Ways (萬道) shine with jade-like brilliance.\n\nAttain boundless ease (逍遥),\nTrue freedom (真自在),\nWhere the *Qingxu* (清虚) and *Xiaoxi* (消息) ever harmonize.\n\nFrom the *Yuanchu* (元初) this cause began,\nSince the beginningless *jie* (劫), no obstacle stands.\nTo call forth immortals (神仙),\nVague and mysterious, silent before.\n\nWhy not treasure this marvel as marvelous?\nWhat else could be deemed profound?\nBy nature, the *Jing* (精) flows clear,\nThus enlightenment dawns—no need for talk or cultivation.\n\nWhy ponder arcane mysteries?\nWhy seek hidden formulas?\nNo increase, no decrease,\nNo birth, no death—no rising or falling.\n\nForever as companion to wind and moon,\nEternally with clouds and mists entwined.\n\n*Song of the Bamboo Staff* (竹杖歌)\nA single bamboo staff—*Wuzhuo* (無著) in name,\nEach node glows with resplendent light.\nNoble is its hollow core, straight and upright,\nIts sheath encased with Elixir’s essence.\n\nUnshaken, unmoved—ever at ease,\nAdapting to all things with effortless grace.\nSeeking friends upon the sea’s vast expanse,\nWho can truly teach me refuge?\n\nLast night in dreams I saw the *Qiu* (虬),\nWithin them four times leaping with vigor.\nStaff raised once, foot stepped once,\nA silver thread ascended from the crown.\n\nFurrowed brows revealed, spirit invigorated,\nA luminous pearl emitted, radiant and bright.\nJoyous, plucked from the azure heights,\nThe clouds unbroken, keeping their crimson promise.\n\n*Song of the Mysterious* (窈窈歌)\nAll seek only life’s embrace,\nYet *Feng* (風) demands but death.\nLife means no fixed abode,\nDeath means a resting place.\n\nNo attachment to flesh, fat, or sinew,\nNo clinging to bone, marrow, or essence.\nWhat need for brows, hair, or beard?\nWhat need for tongue, teeth, or lips?\n\nWhy use feet, hands, or head?\nWhy eyes, nose, or ears?\nSmall intestines churn water,\nLarge intestines refine grain.\nWater and grain—so vague,\nDay and night, when shall they cease?\n\nPierce the illusion’s false design,\nDistinguish clearly what is real.\nOther dualities merge into unity,\nYet the Dao stands ever distinct.\n\nThis one here, that one there,\nWhen you meet it, drink the *Qingliang* (清凉) water.\nOnly when *Zhengchunyang* (正純陽) is attained,\nShall you be called *Chongyangzi* (重陽子).\n\n*Song of the Primordial* (元元歌)\nThough they be father, though they be mother,\nThe bond of flesh—no words to utter.\nForged in time, yet now I bear their ancient weight.\nI am

the treasures of *Kunlun* (昆仑).\nCrowns of jade, pearls without end,\nRobes of endless splendor, gold-threaded and bright.\n\nPrimordial this, primordial that—\nThe light returns, revealing the Twenty-Five (五五不離二十五).\nHold fast to this path, cultivate thus,\nYour name already inscribed in the *Changsheng* (長生) register.\n\n*Song of Attainment* (得得歌)\nYin transforms to Yang—only this is true.\nIce pierces fire, yet only thus is it.\nWith fate, I’ve sought the Dao in past and present,\nWithout beginning, yet what could I call?\n\nCall what? Summon immortals,\nVague and mysterious—no years to recall.\nMeeting the *Liangyin* (良因) of Five *Jie* (劫) lineage,\nTogether we enter the *Daluo* (大羅) realm.\n\n*Daluo* (大羅) realm—where marvels unfold,\nUnleashing brilliance for but a moment’s span.\nA single grain, plentiful as silk,\nA perfect light, eternal in its glow.\n\nEternal, it becomes divine,\nHere in *Qingliang* (清凉), beyond sight or sound.\nWhy need incense’s heavy fragrance?\nWhy boast of jingling ornaments?\n\nTheir chimes fade, their echoes cease,\nYet new splendor rises, more transcendent.\nNaturally, a luminous pearl within,\nReflecting the moon beyond the heavens.\n\nMoon beyond the heavens—\nRiding the *Chan* (蟾) wheel’s course,\nHow could this clarity ever be priceless?\n\n*Zhengyi* (正一) erases all traces of birth and death,\nUpright and firm, the profound cause revealed.\nProfound cause, true secret—\nNever bound by anger, joy, or delight.\n\nEmpty space ascends to the clear void,\nWords spoken yet none truly said.\nNone truly said, yet ever more luminous,\nIn this song, the Dao’s *Tang* (堂) manifests.\n\nEons unbroken, new elegance unfolds,\nFrom now on, this name spreads wide.\n\n*Song of the Clear and Awake* (惺惺歌)\nWhy cling to the Four Great (四大)?\nWho then was immortal in that age?\nBetter to perfect the *Yazheng* (雅正) round,\nThan feign unity for false cause.\n\nCrimson reborn, the *Shuangguan* (雙關) treasure,\nPure white unfurled, the *Wuyelian* (五葉蓮) lotus.\nFirst refine the *Jiuzhuan* (九轉),\nThen nurture the *Yangtian* (養田) above.\n\nNurture the Three *Tian* (田),\nFor steadfast longevity,\nThe golden-maned lion roars in rhythm.\nOn the *Duandan* (端午) day, survey the *Xuanyin* (玄陰),\nAt midnight, divide the luminous day.\n\nEver consume without end—all things’ essence,\nSeize the Three *Guang* (光) with divine art.\nExternally, why display brilliance?\nInternally, refine the form in myriad ways.\n\nThis is the *Yuanchu* (元初),\nNow believe this truth exists.\nFirst encounter the *Tachizi* (太赤祖),\nReturn to see the *Shuzhongzhu* (黍中珠).\n\nSeven *Zhulu* (珠戶) gates open wide,\nSix *Dao* (道) silver lights freely unfold.\nGazing upward at the *Baibao* (百寶) hall,\nThis meeting—truth revealed in person.\n\nThis truth—no mistake,\nIn boundless ease, the Elixir’s essence consumed.\nRadiant, resplendent—how clear it is,\nAwake and lucid, yet ever effortless.\n\nPraised by the sun in emerald mist,\nBefore the wind, crimson clouds emerge.\nAt *Kunlun*’s peak, before the jade summit,\nA single lotus flower—our vow.\n\n*Song of the Dao’s Exhortation* (勸道歌)\nCultivate, and branches bloom,\nFail to cultivate, and labor is in vain.\n\nThe scriptures never exhaust their meaning,\nIncense smoke burns in vain, a hollow show.\nWith weary heart and labored strength, anxiety grows,\nExhausting body and mind, leaving only pallor and decay.\n\nWithout wisdom, you frantically seek the fruit of flawlessness,\nUnenlightened, you wander blindly across the bridge of fate.\nOthers’ teachings are endlessly recited,\nYet you dare not uphold your own ancestral Dao.\n\nIn stillness, evil thrives in demonic realms,\nClinging to the middle, you fall into the net of mundane existence.\nFaithfully holding talismans and elixirs—how proper!\nYet you let food and clothing dictate your true needs.\n\nYou boast of emptiness and cold detachment,\nExalting grandeur and dazzling display.\nWinds, flowers, snow, and moon—scenes of sorrow,\nAlcohol, lust, wealth, and arrogance—roots of bondage.\n\nThe gate of affliction opens as you speak of awakening,\nThe path of contention unfolds as you preach liberation.\nMorning and evening, coughs and throat ailments drain you,\nMidday practices scatter like empty wind.\n\nAll these methods are useless—abandon them now.\nFrom this day on, heed only these words.\n\nLet true function arise naturally in serene stillness,\nTrust in compassion to transcend all bounds.\nSilent and tranquil, purity shines forth,\nIn the void’s embrace, darkness harmonizes.\n\nDragons and tigers must not wander the Three Realms,\nInfants and maidens must not dance in vain display.\nMighty roots respond to the strike,\nLonely spirits play their bamboo flutes.\n\nThe Two Forces unite like clay molded,\nThe Five Desires abandoned like carved wood.\nSeize the true sound echoing in emptiness,\nSilence the false roars of your nature.\n\nTwo maidens cast into the gold mine,\nTwo boys enter the jade gourd.\nBreak off the wood’s tip for repeated refining,\nThen open the spring’s waters for repeated rinsing.\n\nGraceful hues defy all adornment,\nClustered forms resist all description.\nTheir appearance dazzles the eye,\nTheir radiance shines like jade and pearl.\n\nReturned to the Dao’s hall, they earn their noble name,\nAllowed only in our gate to be called *A-Jiao*.\n\n*Obtain, obtain, obtain*—\nFree to compose poetry, music, and song.\n\n**Song of Self-Lamentation**\nAh, in my youth, my parents spared no care,\nEver thinking of filial devotion, I strove with all my might.\nYet how could I ever repay such boundless love?\nOnly shallow attachments accumulate in vain.\n\nNow I refuse such weary labor,\nContent in poverty and leisure, selling nothing but high truth.\nDelighted in boundless ease, I nap at noon in blissful repose.\nThe foolish do not grasp my family’s intent,\nNight and day, they scheme in vain.\n\nFour clinging obsessions consume them—\nAlcohol, lust, wealth, and arrogance.\nBetter to let the *Harmful Wind* strike them down,\nFree from worry, far from sorrow.\n\nClouds and waters, green mountains await my joyous roaming,\nI wish to return to the Three Isles, the Ten Directions.\n\nEscape the mundane cage,\nEnter the jade cavern—\nCease this false body’s empty play.\nThen monkeys and horses will all return to nothing,\nAnd only the bright moon remains in use.\n\n**Secret Song of the Dao**\n*Sword-Stalactite, Sword-Stalactite*—how fine!\nHow few can pierce the veil of delusion.\nEven if you claim enlightenment, where shall you go?\nHow shall you bind yourself, how carry yourself?\n\nThis *Sword-Stalactite*—\nIt can drink, too,\nWashing away the tenfold brocade within.\nTen thousand petals, a thousand flowers, ever renewed,\nFive directions’ hues, each with its own rank.\n\nThe *White-Transcending Sword-Stalactite*—\nRound and bright,\nEmitting its own luminous light.\nDazzling yet unmatched,\nEven surpassing the Purple-Gold Elixir.\n\nThis *Sword-Stalactite*—\nIts blade is sharp,\nUnbroken through countless kalpas.\nThe wise see its radiant wisdom,\nThe foolish grow only more confused.\n\nThis *Sword-Stalactite*—\nTruly steel,\nFloating in space, it emits its own light.\nOnly the *Harmful Wind* dares to touch it,\nAnd even then, its essence remains pristine and cool.\n\nThis *Sword-Stalactite*—\nAncient and boundless,\nNeither yin nor yang, neither earth nor dust.\nJust a *lixiangluo*—\nFrom *lixiangluo* comes the lineage’s origin.\n\n**Song of Stability**\nCultivate, and branches bloom anew,\nYet do not chase the light winds—trust in stillness.\nEver bathed in dew and rain, it thrives in emerald green,\nSoft and yielding, it fears no frost nor snow’s decay.\nThus does vitality flourish, qi harmonized.\nDo not rely on scattered pills for virtue’s path,\nNor cling to talismans for transcendence’s hope.\n\nAncestral teachings must be penetrated,\nYour own Dao must be firmly upheld.\nExternal scenes must not intrude, external affairs must cease,\nSearch within for the incense of true essence.\n\nGraceful maidens cast into the gold mine,\nHandsome youths enter the jade gourd.\nOne plants a treasure tree in the ore,\nThe other nurtures the fungus in the vessel.\nTheir union yields three rare virtues,\nTheir meeting dances the Six *Mei*.\n\nTen slender fingers strike the drum,\nSeven gates open to blow the flute.\nThrough raging flames they advance,\nOn surging waves they float.\n\nThe path of true awakening cleanses all filth,\nThe road of perfect fulfillment shines beyond dust.\nCrimson clouds enfold the celestial blue,\nEmerald mists spiral in the azure void.\n\nMysterious and profound, unobstructed,\nAwake and lucid, forever unbound.\n\n**Song of Boundless Ease**\n*Simplified sounds, swift sounds*—\nAbandon wife, forsake child, sever all ties.\nPast affections—no need to lament,\nThe *Harmful Wind* obscures no light.\nGhostly messengers of *Dian* have turned back,\nYour name erased from the Black Register’s rolls.\n\nSpeak with your mouth, act with your heart,\nThe path to Penglai is secure—eternal life awaits.\n\n**Song of Profound Profoundness**\n*Wūzhuō Peak* stands with its ten-thousand-foot staff,\nAt its tip, a child plays in joyous abandon.\nWrapped in clear winds, he leaps in wild delight,\nBefore the bright moon, he boasts of his skill.\n\nAgain and again, he plucks the *màtuó* elixir,\nFrequently tossing the coral cauldron.\nThe elixir and cauldron slip—\nEffort wasted in vain.\n\nParting the silver waves, he gazes at the jade shore,\nAnd there he sees the golden tortoise in the jade vessel.\nQi glows like amber, eyes shine like pearls.\nThe child descends the staff to claim the pearl in vow,\nNot letting the *Lí Dragon* hide it below,\nNor casting it into the clouds—he hurls it to the Azure Void.\n\nObscure and distant, time forgotten,\nFrom this moment, he knows the effortless way.\n\n**Song of the Reached**\nCultivate with wisdom, devise grand strategies,\nSearch and arrange with broad intent.\nThe Eight-Eight Maiden steadies her hands,\nThe Six-Li Gentleman applies his effort.\n\n**Song of the Alchemical Arts**\n\nFair and ruddy, he knows the gold mine’s secret,\nBlack and lithe, he seeks the jade vessel’s treasure.\nHe drinks and pours himself—awake, then drunk,\nTo song and dance he yields, his mirth unshaken.\nHe smashes open the *Yáng Path* to spread the sacred gem,\nThrough the *Yīn Pass* he emerges, the *lùliú* wheel in hand.\nAscending *Kūn Mountain*, he presents a slice of jade,\nReturning to the great sea, he plays with pearls so bright.\nWith every touch, he grasps the Dao’s profound essence,\nWherever he wanders, he finds paths smooth and clear.\nHis head brims with *Lí Dragon*’s hidden wonders,\nHis feet overflow with *Yáo Flower*—seizing emptiness with ease.\nHe teaches his face to move with boundless grace,\nNurturing his roots through breath, the art of *xīhū*.\nAt *Zhōu Chéng*’s dawn, the true awakening comes,\nThe *Dìduān*’s end reveals the great *Dà Chéngsū*.\nAlone, he shines—no difference in his radiance,\nFive paths’ light unified, none can surpass his splendor.\nLike the *Huánghuā* poet’s single gain,\nOr *Qiáo*’s red crow transforming into twin ducks.\nThe *Sān Dǎo* islands call him to their pure retreat,\nThe *Shí Zhōu* lands unite beneath his guiding step.\nIn stillness, he asks the clouds’ crossroads—only the *Dòngdá* knows,\nAdrift and free, he joins the ranks of immortal paths.\n\n---\n\n**Song of the Gift to a Friend**\n\nWho can summon the sea’s refined *qi*?\nOnly *Zōu Zhèngdào* in the *Nínghǎi* ranks.\nGold waves and silver tides return to their source,\nTo welcome *Pénglái Island*—now revealed in sight.\n*Pénglái Island*, where is it found?\nObscure and distant, touching the boundless sky.\nWho shares this boundless ease with me?\nOnly you, my friend, dwell in this cool, pure place.\nThis cool, pure place—truly it exists,\nWhere the *Qīngtóng* child presents the elixir of long life.\nLet it permeate the four seasons’ spring,\nA single pearl’s light roars like thunder.\nIts light roars like thunder—crimson clouds it spews,\nBlanketing the clear sky with marvelous splendor.\nDescending the spirit waves, it stirs not a ripple,\nSoaring to the celestial heights, its expanse knows no end.\nIts expanse knows no end—truly it is seen,\nMysteries profound, revealed in their play.\nThe cloud-car enters the Azure Void once more,\nOn *Dàluó*’s heights, his alchemy takes form.\nHis alchemy takes form—*yuán gēn* obtained,\nThe gate of *wúwéi*’s great Dao now stands revealed.\nMay you turn back and grasp this truth,\nAscend the path of no leakage, beyond all speech.\n\n---\n\n**Song of the Iron Cauldron**\n\n*Iron Cauldron Song*, *Iron Cauldron Song*,\nFrom its first forging, following the golden method.\nIts belly hollow, yielding wonders profound,\nWho knows its secrets, its subtle messages?\n*Iron Cauldron* formed, *Iron Cauldron* formed,\nFrequently filled with jade nectar, brimming.\nWhen fire refines it, snow-waves scatter,\nWhen water clears it, blessings of peace ascend.\n*Iron Cauldron* carried, *Iron Cauldron* carried,\nIts ringing strikes the deaf, dispelling ignorance.\nIf one would hear its resonant call,\nNorth or south, east or west—all shall know.\n*Iron Cauldron* new, *Iron Cauldron* new,\nIts inner light and outer glow are kin.\nTo add to the cauldron, one must rely on *jīnyè*’s tide,\nTo blend and harmonize, all depends on *qi* and spirit’s might.\n*Iron Cauldron* wide, *Iron Cauldron* wide,\nWhere *qi* surges, snow drifts in endless tide.\nOnly then does the *Hǔlóng* coil in still embrace,\nWrapping lead and mercury tight on its head.\n*Iron Cauldron* deep, *Iron Cauldron* deep,\nNo dust or defilement can breach its keep.\nIts use is fire that burns the wood above,\nIts practice, gold refined within the water’s love.\n*Iron Cauldron*’s light, *Iron Cauldron*’s light,\nThree lights shine—auspicious signs take flight.\nEach time it’s used, transformations arise,\nWhen left to rest, it cools with tranquil skies.\n*Iron Cauldron* burned, *Iron Cauldron* burned,\nLast night, today, and the morn to come.\nBy seasonal rule, the furnace is set,\nWith time, the jade mushrooms grow.\n*Iron Cauldron*’s power, *Iron Cauldron*’s power,\nWithin it, the *qi* swells like a stormy tower.\nObscure and distant, the wind is its friend,\nDrowsy and silent, the moon its companion.\n\n---\n\n**West River Moon (Alchemical Reflections)**\n\nWorthy of praise—this southwest land’s ease,\nBurning firewood, all of it true silver.\nWithin the flames, two forms are seared apart,\nHalf of them blooming as gold flowers.\nRecognizing the *jīnxīng*’s weight with precision,\nAt once, the merit is paid in full.\n*West River Moon* wraps the spirit’s essence,\nRevealing the *língtóng*’s true seal.\nWorthy of praise—the water’s single flow,\nMust rely on a thousand cauldron additions.\nFrom the sea’s heart, a ten-thousand-fathom pole sways firm,\nAfter stillness, the mushrooms sprout.\nUnderstanding the labor, swift and sure,\nOne finds joy in ease, immersed in bliss.\n*West River Moon* wraps the mushrooms’ tender shoots,\nCarrying them to the *Shí Zhōu* and *Sān Dǎo*.\nWorthy of praise—leaving home’s threshold,\nMust neighbor the *Jiǎdì Gēngtú*’s sacred path.\nIn darkness, he claps his hands, calling in laughter,\nSlowly, they blend in perfect harmony.\nLocking the golden gate, the *Bái Yáng* teams form pearls,\n*West River Moon* wraps the lone jade hare,\nIlluminating the path of eternal life.\nWorthy of praise—the clouds rise from his crown,\nSoaring aloft, where wonders abound.\nMysteries profound all radiate in light,\nWithin the cauldron, silver waves ignite.\nAshamed to refine, he turns to gold’s face,\n*Yáo Flower* blooms, dancing in grace.\n*West River Moon* wraps the drink of jade nectar,\nA thousand paths of crimson clouds part.\nWorthy of praise—the wood and gold’s dual form,\n*Jiǎfū Gēngfù* smile with joy.\nTheir laughter’s sweetness echoes in flowing streams,\nA clear current emerges from the ravine.\nNourishing the *huángyá*’s endless growth,\nThey teach white snow to cycle in rebirth.\n*West River Moon* wraps my climb,\nEach step, the silver hare watches my path.\nWorthy of praise—the day’s swift change,\nFrequently wiping the spirit’s hall.\nA single light dispels all dust,\nIts brilliance pierces both inside and out.\nClaiming adrift ease, his flute scatters cold plums,\n*West River Moon* wraps the *guìhuā*’s bloom,\nIts fragrance draws the clean winds to meet.\nWorthy of praise—the white lotus unfurls,\nThree chariots harnessed to the golden ox.\nNaturally, its red splendor covers the peaks,\nNot forged by labor, but by spirit’s light.\nGuarded by the refined glow’s power,\nThe elixir’s done—its radiance lights the divine boat.\n*West River Moon* wraps the sight of *Yíngzhōu*,\nA single strike of the immortal song resounds.\nWorthy of praise—this melody’s grace,\nMoved by the *Shífù*’s stone flute’s embrace.\nOn mountain peaks, they speak of water’s frequent rain,\nIn ocean depths, they whisper of fire’s flame.\nWhen the round brilliance shines true,\nThe pure wind spreads, its gusts unrivaled.\n*West River Moon* wraps the eating of mushrooms’ taste,\nTheir flavors clear—now understood.\nWorthy of praise—this single true nature,\nGained with laughter, the wise now stumble.\nNo incense burned, no scriptures read,\nThis path alone leads swift and speed.\n\n「便把那人喝定，今朝说与叮咛。\n*Now that the man is thoroughly awakened, today I speak and admonish him.*\n\n西江月裹最分明，\n*The West River Moon’s embrace reveals clarity most bright,*\n堪用家风清莹。\n*Worthy to

World**\n\nThe Earthly Lung, Master Zhòngyáng,\nIs called the Royal Harmonic Wind.\nWhen it comes, the days and months extend,\nWhen it departs, one follows the west or east.\nIt takes the clouds and waters as companions,\nAnd the void and emptiness as neighbors.\nThe true nature of the One Spirit remains,\nNot aligned with the multitude’s minds.\n\n---\n\n**Poem**\n\nTo Wáng Jùn:\n*If you halt halfway, wait until the Royal Harmonic Wind departs, then cease.*\nAdmonish you not to cling to the \"having within, lacking without\"—\n*Without the without, you lose the having within;*\n*With the with, you nurture the jade-flower crown,*\n*And from each crown, you gather the golden lotus head.*\n\n---\n\n**Poem**\n\nThe Royal Harmonic Wind repeatedly visits the Lotus Sect,\nFor the Three Teachings, only your Daoist discourse is shared.\nAt this moment, we meet in perfect harmony above and below,\nIn the midst, our gathering aligns with each’s own west or east.\nKnow that winter solstice yields the green and white,\nAnd spring equinox reveals the crimson and verdant.\nSwiftly, the Three Lights may be grasped if wisdom dawns,\nHastily, the Four Illusions dissolve into emptiness.\nA single round and luminous essence suffuses all things,\nYet the myriad forms conceal it utterly.\nThe awakened nature naturally flows like water in stillness,\nThe enlightened mind enters the hundred-blooming flowers.\nEach illusion shattered still returns to the marvelous,\nEach return reveals the ultimate end.\nFood and drink merely sate the hunger—two wondrous means,\nBefore you, the jade-like lingzong stands clear.\n\nTo the Daoist Assembly:\n*All know that the long and the Dao are neighbors,*\n*Seeking the profound and profound, you bind kinship.*\nDo not forget the Three Teachings’ logic,\nNor abandon the eternal spring of Complete Perfection.\nNurture the Original Qi to ever fill,\nSecure the Spirit Essence to never leak.\nThe Nineteenfold Radiance as my wish,\nDare I invite you to join in boundless joy?\n\n**On the Celestial Realm:**\n*Seizing its true essence, search ends in absolute clarity,*\n*Each form dissolved, yet none intrude.*\nThe Jade Retreat’s depths are naturally serene,\nWhite clouds drift without intent, their comings and goings.\nThe swelling moon enhances its splendor,\nFine breezes carry melodies of virtue.\nWith languid gaze, I observe Pan Yue’s prose,\nWith leisurely touch, I stroke Bo Ya’s zither.\nOutside, the flowers and strolling crowds grow still,\nWithin, the herbs and elixirs gather close.\nThe Three Fields must return to their supreme treasure,\nThe One Nature ascends to lofty peaks.\nNurturing the phantom body as bright as light,\nDancing the prenatal sage like wind and song.\nVanished and silent in endless twilight,\nEternal stillness guards the water’s gold within.\n\n**On the Question of Dreams:**\n*Capturing the mind-monkey, taming the spirit-god,*\n*There is no dream-distress when the true nature is held.*\nThe tail’s root remains motionless, preserving vital essence,\nThe kidney’s sea ever replenishes the silver waters of the Primordial.\nInternally, this fosters heightened awareness,\nExternally, it nourishes the body’s life.\nWidely practicing rituals and incantations to save all,\nYou attain the carefree shore-dweller’s ease.\nTo Master Wáng:\n*Seeking the Dao in practice requires no teacher,*\n*Only self-knowledge within the heart.*\nIn purity, wisdom ever grows,\nIn seclusion, compassion naturally arises.\nCarrying firewood, fetching water—only the sound matters,\nGazing at forms, pondering thoughts—each does as they will.\nReducing food to forget the self is noble generosity,\nEmbracing joy to take delight is true cultivation.\nHealing others with medicine brings supreme merit,\nAvoiding wine and meat is most fitting conduct.\nWait until the gate opens to reveal the Host’s nature,\nThen follow the fateful thread to its end.\n\n**On Internal Matters:**\n*In cultivation’s logic, speak with careful emphasis,*\n*Only the heart’s stillness and clarity suffice.*\nWhen the eye’s vision ceases, the dragon rests within,\nWhen the nostril’s block is lifted, the tiger lingers no more.\nThe tongue retreats from taste, the mind and spirit rejoice,\nThe ears release sound, the kidney’s waters grow clear.\nNorth and south harmonize as one body,\nEast and west merge, extinguishing the Three Passions.\nWood and metal vie in the coiled abdomen’s realm,\nThe prenatal sage follows, moving freely at will.\nThe Golden Elixir forms at the crown’s apex,\nFive radiant lights illuminate the Dao’s rainbow canopy.\n\n**On Drinking and Gambling:**\n*The heart drifts in idle amusement, lost in fleeting pleasures,*\n*Unrestrained abandon leads to the brink of ruin.*\nDo not let drinking sever filial piety,\nNor let gambling disrupt your household.\nThe Daoist path is best entered with reverence,\nThe royal law must be followed without extravagance.\nEquality in action brings ease,\nAnd you may join me in the misty peaks.\n\n**To the Scholar on Learning:**\n*Zài Yǔ’s midday slumber is unbearable to behold,*\n*Wasting light and time in sleep and gluttony.*\nDiligence in a humble dwelling brings no shame,\nIn a thatched hall, cultivation seeks no comfort.\nSnow reflected through the window brings constant joy,\nHead suspended in meditation finds its own delight.\nGreat ambition need not cling to a single treasure,\nSun Bin’s wisdom suits the study of Ní Kuān.\n\n**To Master Xiǎo Dá:**\n*Unlock the original essence, and clarity comes naturally,*\n*Release the true light, and all attachments vanish.*\nThe Three Treasures must converge to perfect awareness,\nThe One Spirit fears no obstruction in its completion.\nMastering subtle applications requires purity and stillness,\nRecognizing the profound depends on clarity and refinement.\nFit to be a carefree guest beyond the clouds,\nTreading the path of longevity toward the fore.\n\n**Self-Narrative:**\n*Crimson agate hangs in the silent void,*\n*Deep stillness and mystery before my eyes.*\nWith mother-of-pearl, I fortify the elixir chamber,\nAnd with amber, I till the Field of Regeneration.\nFour precious treasures securely gathered,\nThe Three Radiances transmitted with utmost care.\nThis method, once attained, transcends the empty world,\nIn the depths of the rainbow, I tread the Golden Lotus.\n\n**On Life and Death:**\n*Ever know contentment to roam freely,*\n*Do not cling deeply to the fire’s pit.*\nThe nature above is clear—two paths divide,\nBefore noon, recognize the Host’s true form.\nThe One True Essence reveals its luminous structure,\nThe Seven Orifices breathe the auspicious Qi.\nPalming compassion and mercy, you transcend the Dharma-realm,\nOn the path of cool clarity, you attain eternal life.*\n\n**To a Friend Who Offers Wine:**\n*Though the road ascends without my bidding,*\n*The mist and clouds summon my nature to awaken.*\nTen thousand miles of clear wind as constant companion,\nOne wheel of bright moon as ever-present disciple.\nMountains green and waters blue, step by step they guide,\nWine white and barley yellow, turn by turn they beckon.\nTonight’s cup, if taken with intent,\nUnleashes the red flame to illuminate the ice-cup’s depths.*\n\n**To a Friend Seeking Quietude:**\n*Black clouds disperse, the moon shines ever clearer,*\n*Illuminating the dusty world, extinguishing all sentient longing.*\nNo more afflictions arise when perfect wisdom is held,\nNo more quarrels remain when the deep pit of duality is crossed.\nAbove the peaks, a subtle breeze arrives,\nWithin the heart, I welcome the light snow.\nThe recluse who faces the wall knows this flavor,\nOn the carefree path, they attain the round and perfect.\n\n**On Transient Glory:**\n*Not clinging to honor and splendor is a virtuous cause,*\n*Distant and detached, your vision grows ever new.*\n\n**On the Eight Consciousnesses and Five Gates:**\nEightfold perception penetrates the boundless night—\nFivefold luminosity shines upon eternal spring.\nFrom this, one may transcend the Three Realms,\nBy this, one may emerge from the Six Dusts with divine grace.\nA single golden lotus ascends to the highest realm,\nRound and perfect, never to sink into the mire of delusion.\n\n**To a Friend:**\nThe Dao is wordless, beyond hearing’s reach,\nZen’s boundless openness unites all beings.\nWhich seated practice can awaken one?\nWho discerns the incense’s smoke as it divides?\nSeizing the true essence of the Three Lights,\nThe Four Great Elements dissolve in their tumult.\nA radiant cluster shines beyond the void,\nOnly then does one drift free like white clouds.\n\n**A Friend’s Inquiry:**\nNature’s rhythms unfold in tranquil ease,\nNo need for elixirs, no need for immortals.\nA single breath nurtures the spirit ever purer,\nA thousand gold pieces cannot buy the bliss of high slumber.\nCrimson flames pierce the three peaks,\nWhite lotuses bloom fresh with five petals.\nPiercing through the labor of practice’s path,\nHere, one may recognize the profoundest mystery.\n\n**On the Eye:**\nLike sunlight, clear as crystal,\nIlluminating all, ever vigilant.\nGazing only at the empty spectacle of dust,\nWould you read the *Huangting* scriptures within or without?\nThe pupil steadied cannot see the Dao,\nA child sits upright, yet does not perceive form.\nIf a teacher meets you with a golden needle,\nHe will scrape away the dust—your wisdom eye will shine bright.\n\n**Self-Realization:**\nTeeth fallen, hair gray, my aged frame remains,\nYet the original spirit clings to foolishness still.\nIn the market’s hustle, I earn my daily bread,\nOn the mountain’s heights, I bear the moon’s solitude alone.\nDispelling the waters, the fire’s essence is revealed,\nParting the smoke, I point to the ice-cup’s lake.\nFrom this moment, my crimson clouds unfurl,\nTreading upon pure yin, this wheel of darkness is shattered.\n\n**On the Sword:**\nAwakened, the treasure-sword is clearest of all,\nSharpened and polished, it stands mute before me.\nLifted high, it splits the new Dao’s eye,\nA single stroke severs the old entanglements of the heart.\nDawn reveals its pristine, unstained brilliance,\nNight emits its radiance with resounding clarity.\nIt repels demonic forces and malevolent qi,\nAll dissolve into formlessness beyond the void.\n\n**Composed at Comrade Zheng’s Residence:**\nToday, on this clear and bright water hall,\nA dwelling place where all may dwell in perfect ease.\nChildren, grandchildren, wives—all rejoice in harmony,\nTheir virtue as fragrant as the lotus on the Dao’s path.\nRetreating from self to serve others is Comrade Zheng’s way,\nResting the mind in goodness surpasses scriptural study.\nWhen fortune arrives, we dwell beyond green mountains,\nA thousand *li* of white clouds as our painted screen.\nLast night, I dreamed the Eight Immortals called,\nThey bestowed robes of *luan* and jade embroidery.\nSpread out scrolls of barbarian silk, richly embroidered,\nA single elephant-tusk flute wafts clouds and mist.\nI widely impart teachings to open the heart’s ground,\nWriting verses and poems to sow fields of merit.\nWho can fathom the secrets of celestial mechanism?\nOnly the *Harmful Wind* can transmit its essence alone.\n\n**Hearing the Oriole’s Song:**\nToday, the twenty-eighth of the third month,\nA sudden oriole’s cry pierces my ear.\nI open the Dao’s eye to behold it—\nIts feathers newly brushed with gold.\nIt turns and sings its pure, clear notes,\nIts intent, I think, aligns with my own heart.\nLike a *qin* just tuned to its finest pitch,\nEven the wind and moon, without sentiment, are its audience.\n\n**Early Spring:**\nThe world’s net unravels—no dust to stain,\nThe garden blooms like a spring within a cave.\nDo you still recognize the carefree traveler?\nDo I not dwell in effortless ease?\nVerses flow as I sit, one after another,\nDrunk, I raise the wine cup again and again.\nThe four seasons’ flowers bloom in their own splendor,\nYet only this pure fragrance remains equal.\nThe mundane cage is left far behind,\nWho today knows the spring beyond the world?\nIf one clings to the embroidered sash,\nThey have already become a carefree recluse.\nPoetry spreads through the brush’s swift strokes,\nWine glides through the fragrant cup, ever anew.\nRecognize the ancestors’ true ground,\nGolden sprouts nourished throughout the garden’s expanse.\n\n**Inscribed on a Friend’s Tower:**\nDeeply I envy the child’s joy in driving the ox,\nNo need for adornment, no rush to comb the hair.\nLeisure is the true kin of incense’s sacred flame,\nLabor’s toil knows not the distant, boundless ease.\nThough the *Penglai* Isles lie but a step away,\nThe carefree path to the Purple Palace I’ve already trod.\nLetting go of the River of Love brings utmost purity,\nThe light carriage glides across the Ten Realms.\n**To a Friend on the Snow:**\nScarlet clouds thicken, the white sand chills—\nDancing in the void, they blind the eye’s reach.\nAuspicious omens fill the measure of a foot,\nThe six-petaled flower blooms as prophecy.\nBeyond the scene, the painted image returns to the fisherman,\nWithin the radiance, purity belongs to the immortals.\nAs evening falls, the moon clears the dense mist,\nA single stream of light illuminates the white clouds.\n\n**To My Nephew:**\nA new poem for my seventh brother,\nMy words are earnest—do not waste your days.\nUphold the nation’s laws, ponder righteousness,\nGuard the military gates, protect the armor and spear.\nIn shared meals, let courtesy prevail,\nIn speech and song, let humility lead.\nPrioritizing others is the wisest path,\nSoon you shall return, singing triumphant songs.\n\n**On My Elder Brother’s Birthday:**\nAuspicious clouds and mists give birth to the virtuous,\nAt five hundred years, the third month’s encounter is most wondrous.\nThe eleventh day’s hour is uniquely rare,\nThree thousand years have passed since the peach blossoms first bore fruit.\nDo not refuse the golden *xueliang* wine—add more,\nLet the jade censer’s incense burn full and bright.\nI raise my cup in toast—none can compare,\nToday, as your younger brother, I speak with care.\nIf compared to gold and jade, they may be lacking,\nIf compared to rivers and seas, they are not exhausted.\nIf compared to iron and stone, they may be shattered,\nIf compared to pines and cypresses, they may be bent.\nYet my brother’s longevity surpasses all—\nEndless, unbroken, never to fade.\nMidday has passed the radiant sun’s peak,\nTender green and delicate red mark the forbidden smoke.\nThe true fire of purity is now revealed,\nNot lost in the murky wine—his Dao is firm.\nKnowing his singular nature brings eternal life,\nWhy shame the mortal frame with its old rags?\nThe swallow’s murmurs are all enchanting,\nThe oriole’s trills gaze upon the virtuous child.\nWho among the Three Fields recognizes the treasure within emptiness?\nThe Four Deceptions I alone perceive on the mountain’s heights.\nIf one reverses the Five Phases’ order,\nEven today, one may meet the immortals.\n\n**Reflections:**\nLeisurely, leisurely, I take up the brush,\nRevealing the Four Worthies within the study hall.\nThe inkstone boy adds water with a child’s delight,\nThe red-robed maiden grinds the ink with ancient skill.\nThe silver-haired youth transmits the script,\nThe green-browed maiden spreads the brocade paper.\nNinefold transformations arrange the true jade’s glow,\nA single stroke completes the pearl’s perfection.\nBright light gathers in a thousand gleaming forms,\nVibrant hues cluster in five resplendent colors.\n\nThe **Celestial Master’s** lofty ascent—\nTenfold worthy to offer the Great Dao’s saints.\nThe Wind King’s harm retreats to distant peaks,\nTrusting feet like clouds near the Ocean’s bounds.\n\nEight hundred deeds bear twin trees’ fruit,\nThree thousand merits thunder in one voice.\nNo lust for steeds nor worldly cravings rise,\nNor monkey-minds to plunder mortal wealth.\nWealth and desire both may vanish clean,\nYet wealth and desire need not cling to me.\nForever banished from the Yellow Springs’ fall,\nLong since turned back—now the Dao’s eye opens wide.\nWherever the Azure Mists gleam bright,\nI follow wind and moon past the Jade Terrace.\n\n---\n**To Li Dao Friend**\nYour leisure knows no bound, your joy unbound—\nThe Dao is whole, the world’s dust cast aside.\nYour verses shine like banished immortals’ words,\nYour spirit echoes Laozi’s ancient home.\nYet know the literary heights of Han Yu,\nAnd the lute hall’s bond with Bo Ya’s tune.\nDoes Rong Qiao still walk this earth?\nLet us return to Penglai, striding on clouds.\n\n---\n**Continuing the Rhyme**\nFrom cloud-roots rise, unbound by mortal span,\nEverywhere the wind and moon’s bright play.\nTwo cranes cross the water—mine to ride,\nThe Qichuan scene now mine to claim.\nClear and empty qi, by Master’s guidance,\nSerene and pure—yet I fall short of Yi Ya’s grace.\nAdrift in ease, I grasp true freedom’s art—\nWhy seek elixirs or feast on morning mist?\n\n---\n**On the Red-Eyed [Saint]**\nWhat sound within your ears now sharpens clear?\nYet eyes like blindness, crimson and unseeing.\nLike monks at first stillness, deep in dhyana’s hold,\nOr the Dao’s first steps—now the work begins.\nInner thoughts dissolve, the spirit dwells serene,\nNo outward musings—emptiness is all.\nThe wild horse tamed, the mind’s monkey bound,\nThe Jade Path at the crown now opens wide.\n\n---\n**On the Charcoal Grinder**\nThe donkey’s strength too weak for the steep path’s climb,\nThe driver’s wrath stirs—his blows rain down.\nOne heart’s fury at the pace too slow,\nTwo hands wield the whip in ceaseless pain.\nYet why not know what’s light and what’s heavy?\nMore suffering comes from this blind strife.\nOh, how cruel—no mercy in his sight!\nThis alone proves karma’s bitter fruit.\n\n---\n**Master Shuo’an’s Transformation of Ma Yu**\nA monk of nameless rank guards stillness here,\nHis verse proclaims:\n*\"Opening and closing—what cause lies deep?\nSilent sitting banishes greed and wrath.*\nThe tower’s horn like spring’s fleeting dream,\nThe waves of Release now reveal true form.\nWhen clarity dawns, the heart is clear—\nWhen faintest ripples stir, the water’s pure.\nTo watch the world’s folly, bound in ignorance,\nThus I stay in the Zen hall, never leave.\nThe Master answers each line with three—\nEight quatrains follow, marking the Eight Consciousnesses.\n\n*Opening and closing—what cause lies deep?\nAll from the eye’s realm, dust’s net undone.\nWhite steeds pass by, too swift to stain,\nWild horses gallop free, unchecked, unbound.\nSilent sitting banishes greed and wrath—\nNo ear for worldly clamor, no embrace.\nNo drum nor string, yet music lingers near,\nNo chord, yet harmony fills the air.\nThe tower’s horn like spring’s fleeting dream,\nBreath alone suffices—no need for speech.\nThis parting bears clear fruit’s promise bright,\nThis life plants seeds of virtue’s worth.\nThe waves of Release now reveal true form—\nTongue’s five tastes never touch the lip.\nThree times serene, in purity alone,\nOne flavor sweet—beyond all price.\nWhen clarity dawns, the heart is clear—\nA single light within the body glows.\nFrom now, stillness and dimness intertwine,\nYet deeper shadows veil the way.\nWhen faintest ripples stir, the water’s pure—\nDesire and thought dissolve, the heart undone.\nLeakless, effortless—true awakening’s rise,\nNeither gain nor loss seals perfection’s close.\nTo watch the world’s folly, bound in ignorance,\nDelusion clings—life and death ensnare.\nNow light returns, the mirror’s gaze,\nThe heart’s true nature grasped in Dao’s embrace.\nThus I stay in the Zen hall, never leave,\nNo defilement clouds the mind’s pure light.\nUnfulfilled still is my vow to save all beings,\nYet Dao’s deep talk I’ll now unfold.\n\n---\n**To the Monk Named Nameless**\nThe Master now has coolness, pure and bright,\nOne nature shines with fortune’s golden light.\nYet ‘Nameless’ suits him best—where does the Buddha dwell?\nWhere is the Sage who first set foot on earth?\n\n---\n**A Friend’s Inquiry**\nSpring’s youth is best for study’s embrace,\nTruth’s logic clear—no need for forced chase.\nIf exams call, then win with might,\nYet honor’s mark already gleams in sight.\nYan the Scholar pens four lines—twelve more follow:\n\n*\"How does the wheel of birth and death unfold?\nRecognize the primal face, unchanging, old.\nThree treasures, five colors gathered near,\nThe path to longevity gleams with misty light.\nTo love or crave—what law can sever ties?\nTrue purity lies in steadfast will.\nAll things, all forms—no grasp, no cling,\nOne round light on jade pools’ surface shine.\nTime’s fleeting as the wind—how long has passed?\nYet none but fools mistake the way.\nIn leisure, seek the truth’s true face,\nThen joy in freedom, unbound, embrace.\nThough years may age this worn-out frame,\nThe True Person within knows no decay.\nDo not cling to outward guise or show,\nThe child’s pure face reveals no shift or sway.\"*\n\n---\n**To the Fisherman**\nThis fish now dances, wild and free,\nScaled in gold, it leaps the spring’s clear stream.\nThree casts with golden hook—it swallows bait,\nOne tug brings saints to feast at table’s edge.\n\n---\n**To the Novice in Practice**\nWhite robes, green sash—fated ties from old,\nBy chance you met me, crossed the mist’s deep flood.\nThough Dao’s depths still veil your path,\nYou’re now a little wayfarer of Penglai’s hall.\n\n---\n**To a Practicing Friend**\nLeap past Yin-Yang’s forge of fate’s design,\nOne heart for the Dao—turn not back again.\nPurity itself is the path to saints,\nOnly in stillness nurture inner light.\n\n---\n**On the Paper Flag**\nIf wind’s favor brings good fortune’s hand,\nEach dawn I win the sun’s high rest.\nHungry, I beg the streets for coins to spend—\nYet only those who give are truly blessed.\n\n---\n**Echoing a Dao Friend’s Verse**\nSeize the true form—no need to ask your years,\nFive thousand words of incense fill the air.\nLofty ease, like swallows in repose,\nI laugh at spirits bright in jade halls’ glow.\n\n---\n**To Liu the Fourth Friend**\nEver distinguish the mirror’s face,\nLest dust obscures the pearl’s bright grace.\nWith fate’s new thread, your form takes shape,\nYet formless body sheds the old.\nIn dreams you met me, speechless, deep in sleep,\nYet know I came to seek the Wind King’s keep.\nStill you crave talk—let’s meet in ice’s chill,\nWhere warmth and cold in stillness dwell.\n\n**On Fate’s Shallow Fortune and Laborious Days**\nFate bestows but little fortune, scarce the causes arise,\nOnly the toils of life’s path drag me through the years.\nIf you wish to dwell in ease and leisure,\nLet your heart remain ever clean—no cares, no restless strife.\n\nLeave but a few words for my ears to hear,\nWait till your life holds nothing left to do.\nThen we may together roam in carefree bliss,\nMeeting immortals in talk of the Unutterable.\n\nA single finger points the way to Eternal Life,\nYet your nature’s fate still binds you tight.\nFrom the first breath, the truth is clear to see,\nWhy fear the future when you’ve already touched the Way?\n\nReflect now on my words—if fate denies,\nIn you alone, let steadfast resolve arise.\nWith honest heart and simple truth untarnished,\nThough no god nor sage, you’ll walk the path of Virtue.\n\nTo ponder chance encounters, fleeting yet fortunate,\nHow could such leisure ever truly be?\nMan finds no joy in burdens—only ease,\nThen let us rise together, hearts aligned in grace.\n\nBetter than not seeing your face at all,\nIs your virtue everlasting, pure and bright.\nAuspicious signs cling close, like pearls untold,\nOne clear gem shines—your mind’s true light.\n\nTo meet my teacher in dreams is but a sleeping sage,\nYet through you, I’ve known this fateful thread.\nIf you still walk this path as I’ve described,\nNo need for fear—just rest in boundless ease.\n\n**The Blossom of the Third Month**\nAt this fair time, the third month’s flower blooms,\nLike sandalwood in heart, like jade in cheek.\nPluck one branch to crown my head and wear,\nAnd follow me to Penglai’s halls of air.\n\n**On the Paper Skull to Warn Ma Yi**\nAh, lament the world where all are bound in sorrow’s net!\nI must now paint a skull to wake the foolish man.\nIn life, he clings to wrongs and bitter deeds,\nTill he meets this fate—then he’ll cease his strife.\n\nTo be a man, one must perceive the dust of toil,\nA pure mind is treasure none can spoil.\nSnatch the pearl from the Lipu Dragon’s maw,\nAnd enter Kunlun’s caves to live in flawless law.\n\n**Ode to the Moon**\nThe waxing moon is gold, the waning silver bright,\nEach half a measure, gold and silver in the night.\nI’ve bound them both to sixteen *liang*—\nHow then do stars divide their weight?\n\n**Ode to the Dwarf Sophora**\nThe Boundless Sage planted dwarf sophora here,\nIts cool shade spreads wide—who else might share?\nToday, I rejoice beneath its branches green,\nRemembering well when first I planted them.\n\n**Visiting the White Deer Hermitage**\nThis hermitage is named for chill and purity’s call,\nWhere white deer once ascended to the Heavens’ hall.\nDo not mock me for coming here, my friend,\nFor I’ve already found my rest in clouds beyond.\n\n**On the Sudden Change in Weather**\nThe Ho family’s words run deep and wide,\nYesterday’s sun, today’s gloom and pride.\nIf Heaven’s will could be counted by man’s hand,\nIt would be neither high nor broad—just like a mortal’s mind.\n\nWhen neither cold nor heat the wind does blow,\nRound golden cakes reflect the light on my robe.\nThe Martial Constellation now guards the Literary,\nAt the Upper Elemental Festival, brighter than its contrary.\n\n**On a Friend’s Pond**\nNaosun’s pond mirrors Han’s ancient marshes,\nBefore its waves, all sound is hushed and stilled.\nYet turn your gaze to where the water murmurs,\nAnd see the wheel of life’s unjust, unending wheel.\n\n**Hearing Cicadas in the Sixth Month**\nThe cicada sheds its black robe, feels its body light,\nAnd becomes a golden one, perched high to sing its might.\nIt’s found true companionship in breezes clear,\nWho else today would hear this voice so new and rare?\n\nThe black cicada’s shell now cast aside,\nIts body rises, lighter by the tide.\nIn tall sophora’s shade, it sits with grace,\nAnd sings in freedom, soft yet full of place.\n\n**Ode to the Mid-Autumn Moon**\nStrange how the sky now presses cold on man,\nYet rises up a golden plate from mist’s remains.\nNot like the usual three-five nights of old,\nI urge you now—do not dismiss this sight, so bold.\n\n**On the Tea Whisk**\nLight and slender, yet its purpose burns so near,\nLong immersed in oil, its truth grows dim and drear.\nThough I love to stir the tea’s bright glow,\nHow could I know the flame would turn and sear my soul?\n\n**Ode to Bamboo**\nWhen moonlight shines, its nodes are gold like scattered flakes,\nWhen breezes touch, its leaves are jade—so crisp, so frail.\nThrough winter’s chill, it stands with virtue’s mark,\nNot like the common grass that bows and falls apart.\n\n**Ode to Tea**\nOnce I saw it at Zhao’s old abode,\nNow Lu Quan serves it in seven cups of joy.\nAfter brewing, where does it go?\nThe wind carries me to Penglai’s shore.\n\n**Giving a Fan to My Nephew to Ward Off Dust**\nYou wash away wine and wool with care,\nI give this frost-laden fan to little Seventh Brother.\nTo clear the dust and open the eyes of the Dao,\nAnd grant my child forevermore this breeze of Virtue.\n\n**On the Fifteenth Night Moon**\nAs twilight fades and clouds withdraw,\nThe moon’s cold wheel still shines where night withdraws.\nThis light tonight is clear and bright—distinct,\nDo not compare it to the common sight.\n\n**On the Tea House**\nI’ve feasted on coiled peaches, better than mere fruit,\nThis flavor’s taste belongs to me—my suit.\nTo trade the false for truth, my nature’s call,\nPoint the way to Penglai, where rainbows span the hall.\n\n**Lamenting the World**\nAh, lament the world where name and gain are sought,\nMorning’s greed and evening’s love—no end in sight.\nTo see it clearly is like watching chess,\nWhen lost, the pieces scatter, and the game is done, no less.\n\nHurry, hurry now, to cultivate and rise,\nI’ll paint this skull to mark the path you’ll choose.\nFrom ancient times, men chase what’s vain and bright,\nTill now, they’ve not yet learned to cease their fight.\n\n**When My Eastward Journey Was Delayed by a Friend’s Deception**\nWho held my feet? I’ll slowly gather them,\nYet now I see—no need for such a scheme.\nToday I’ve found the road ahead,\nAnd now my carefree vessel sails to shore with speed.\n\nYour feet you’ll hold, but I’ll detect your truth,\nThe True Wind’s path will search you out.\nYou know full well the ties that bind,\nTo cultivate and follow the land’s true law you’ll find.\n\n**Leisurely Thoughts**\nOne wheel of moon, one breath of wind,\nWithin and without, they dance and blend.\nRolling from Kunlun’s peak so high,\nTheir light and breeze are clear—nature’s majesty.\n\n**Gazing in the Mirror**\nWho knows that in the mirror’s strange embrace,\nI’ve split the south and north in two with grace?\nI lift my spirit-mind to view its light,\nNo need to seek another’s face so bright.\n\n**Self-Composed Verse**\nFrom this, I’ll tear apart the net of iron true,\nToday I leap from dust’s confining cage anew.\nNow take the moon and play it with my hands,\nAnd scatter idle clouds to seek the Wind King’s lands.\n\n**On a Caged Parrot**\nPainted as a parrot, yet it does not chirp,\nFreed from its cage, it leaves life’s grip.\nTell the butterfly not to mock its flight,\nFor now it soars beyond this narrow sight.\n\n**On Parting from Kin**\nWith heart and mind pure, no need for hair’s deceit,\nThe water-clouds are my path, my fate.\nNo need for mourners when my body’s gone,\nBut take this chance—now leave the bonds of life’s old sun.\n\n**On the First Day of the Fifth Month**\nI honor those who gather in the White Lotus Society,\nWhere guests and moon unite—this chance is rare and free.\nIf all would wake to eat the food of Ling Mountain’s height,\nThey’d trade their lives for immortality in silent night.\n\n**On the Fifteenth Day of the Fifth Month**\nMay the household first know peace and auspicious fortune,\nThen kindle the fire within your heart.\nBurn away to see the original true face,\nGazing with joy upon the reunion’s embrace.\n\n**On the Jade Flower Golden Lotus Society**\nI urge you not to cling to *having* within *not-having*,\nNor lose *not-having* by grasping *having* within *not-having*.\n*Nurture having* to bloom the Jade Flower head,\nAnd *each head* will bear the Golden Lotus crown.\n\n**To the Fishing Hermit**\nAfter casting your line, you see the tortoise again,\nKnowing your fate lies among the ranks of immortals.\nThe *wūláng* calls out—it knows my intent—\nLeaping from the surging waves a thousand feet high.\n\n**To Cui the Thousand-Household Officer Seeking Wisdom**\nRefined essence seeks clarity,\nWithin, pure nature’s virtue stands firm.\nNaturally, wisdom unfolds,\nSurely revealing brilliance’s birth.\nTo teach you shared sorrow’s weight,\nMay years extend like Pengzu’s span.\nUniting the Three Teachings’ truths,\nFar off, the path’s true measure is gained.\n\n**For Hao Shenghua After Smashing the Jar**\nShattering the true ash jar,\nNow the Wind King’s sight is revealed.\nTrue remnants await awakening—\nEach soul calls out to the one.\nTo keep the heart unshaken,\nBreak each illusion clean.\nAt *zi-wu-ma-you* hours,\nObserve the skull’s hollow stare.\n\n**Leisurely Verse**\nLaughing at this wild Dao,\nWhy now delight in borrowed light?\nFollow fate to dissolve old karma,\nNo longer crafting fresh misfortune.\nTame the mind-horse with firm reins,\nRestrain the heart-monkey tight.\nCultivate the Way with urgency,\nEach day drawing fragrant virtue’s breath.\n\n**On Skulls**\nThis is King Zhao’s hollow frame,\nIn life, his nature was weak.\nStrip away your skull’s disguise—\nNow the Mid-Autumn moon shines clear.\n\n**On Coolness**\nCoolness—what does it resemble?\nNot the same as bitter cold’s harshness.\nMidnight moon over still waters,\nEarly autumn breeze after rain.\n\n**To Fan Caifu**\nMy nephew, called Fifth Brother Wang,\nHis wife, they call my niece.\nThe two have forged a blessed bond—\nMay neither suffer ruin’s pain.\nIf you seek the *mercury-lead* path,\nNurture the True Dragon and Tiger.\nThe True Dragon and Tiger—\nMost do not recognize—\nOne each beside Red Phoenix Peak.\nGuarding their nests, they intertwine,\nExchanging east and west in trade.\nThis trade, when rightly done,\nSlays the Three Pengs in the Dan Field.\nNone grasp the double meaning’s depth,\nYet a spirit boy strikes the fifth watch.\nStriking the fifth watch, news spreads—\nA pure spring’s perfect accord.\nLike ambrosia poured upon the crown,\nOnly I know its true essence.\nKnow it well—rest, rest, rest,\nNiece, nephew, hasten your practice.\nIf you refuse my words,\nIn the wilderness, two skulls you’ll be.\n\n**Proclamation for the Golden Lotus Society**\nBy the eternal light of wisdom’s lamp,\nWe rely on the Jade Bud’s radiance.\nThe nature-torch burns eternally,\nUnveiling the Golden Lotus’s glow.\nBathing in the Three Lights’ brilliance,\nDissolving the Four False names.\nTreading the void, probing the profound,\nSearching for marvels rare.\nWashed clean in purity’s realm,\nMoving through fragrant paths.\nEach holds pearls and jade,\nTogether presenting crystal and gem.\nDisplaying the vital essence,\nNurture the qi with care.\nSlightly mastering this key,\nHang the fragrant title high.\n\n**Proclamation for the Jade Flower Society**\nThe transformation of jade is the essence of *qi*,\nThe Golden Lotus is the ancestor of spirit.\nWhen *qi* and spirit intertwine,\nThey become immortals.\n*The Yinshu Jing* annotates:\n*\"Spirit is the child of qi, qi the mother of spirit.\nWhen mother and child unite,\nImmortal birth is achieved.\"*\n\nEstablishing the Jade Flower Golden Lotus Society\nIn these two prefectures,\nAll must recognize true nature.\nUnaware of the true source,\nMany study minor side paths—\nMerely methods to foster blessings and life,\nNot the Dao’s true cultivation.\nIn matters of life and nature,\nEven slight error veers from humanity.\n\nIf you seek true practice,\nWhen hungry, eat;\nWhen tired, sleep—\nNo need to sit in meditation,\nNo need to study the Way.\nOnly screen out worldly entanglements,\nOnly seek the two characters: *heart-clear*.\nThe rest is not cultivation.\n\nEach holds wisdom—\nDaily in the hall of abstinence,\nReflect deeply,\nLest you stray to other doors.\n\nTrue function has its own true function and true practice.\nThe True Person of Jin said:\n*\"To achieve true function,\nOne must purify the heart, settle the mind,\nCalm the spirit and emotions,\nNeither moving nor acting,\nTruly clear and pure,\nEmbrace the Original, preserve the One,\nNurture the spirit, stabilize the qi—\nThis is true function.*\n\n*To achieve true practice,\nOne must cultivate virtue and power,\nRelieve poverty and ease suffering,\nSeeing others in distress,\nAlways harboring a heart of rescue,\nOr transform and guide the virtuous\nTo enter the Way and practice.\nIn all actions,\nPrioritize others over self,\nUnselfish toward all beings—\nThis is true practice.\"*\n\nMay all honorably heed these words.\nThe *Complete Authentic Collection of Chongyang* ends here, Volume Ten.\n\n**Volume Eleven of the Complete Authentic Collection of Chongyang**\n*Composed by Master Zhongyang of Zhongnan Mountain, Wang Zhe*\n\n---\n**Song: *Zhuiyan Xiang* (醴醾香)**\nAt ease with fate’s unfolding,\nTrusting steps without thought or reckoning.\nA crisp breeze calls the moon as companion,\nTogether, boundless and free.\n\nAlong the long road, joyful and singing,\nLips hum, tongues pluck the air’s melody.\nSuddenly passing through the immortal’s halls,\nMountain peaks—worth lingering to admire.\n\nJust as blessings multiply and gather,\nStrange fruits and flowers scatter sweetness and fragrance.\nThough fine weather and beauty may tempt,\nLet water and clouds guide my path—\nTo the farthest shores, the distant horizon.\n\nThen I meet the pure spirit-vessel,\nFerrying me beyond this shore.\nThis time, I’ve become a true Daoist wind-han.\n*Hechuang Tian* (鹤冲天)\n\nDelusions vanish, the path is clear—\nNow I may truly cultivate and refine.\nStillness is the root, the true gateway.\nDo not seek elsewhere, lest you stray from the Dao’s path,\nAnd miss the way to the immortals.\n\nIn leisure’s deepest quiet,\nThe primal root and luminous essence unfold,\nLayer by layer, ever more awakened.\nWhen virtue and practice are complete,\nOnly crimson clouds remain.\n\nOnce, I met my master in person,\nWho taught me the secret of eternal life,\nAgain and again, with tender care.\nNow I know I’ve been saved.\n\nI vow to follow, hand in hand,\nThrough endless clouds, forevermore.\n\n---\n**Song: *Wang Yuanxing* (望远行)**\nUnder the sun’s bright gaze,\nThe moon pours silver, stars gleam clear.\nWhere the Three Lights converge,\nFive colors rise in stillness—\nA silent witness to true cultivation,\nWhere qi and spirit gather.\nNow I may tread the hidden path.\n\nThis fullness of virtue and practice is certain.\nWith uprightness, I must refine and polish,\nRevealing the original true nature—\nEvery leaf luminous, every branch refined,\nPure and everlasting.\n\nBeyond the clouds, the Green Boy holds the decree,\nPassing down the Celestial Emperor’s command.\nI thank the Ten Isles of Master Shizhou—\nThe immortals have summoned me.\n\n---\n**Song: *Yong Xue* (咏雪)**\nBlessings spread like jade and pearls,\nCut by wind into delicate flakes,\nScattered across the void,\nFalling like powder on eaves and tiles.\nLocking gardens in silence,\nDotting paths with fleeting marks—\nTruly a scene fit for brush and ink.\n\nEven treasures of jade and pearl cannot compare\nTo this harvest’s bounty.\nPure and fresh, its brilliance shimmers,\nIts crispness ever refreshing.\n\nValleys flatten, mountains blend into one,\nNear and far, no boundary remains.\nJust like my home—\nCelestial landscapes, clear and boundless,\nGlowing like Penglai’s pavilions,\nBathed in eternal light.\n\n---\n**Song: *Manting Fang* (满庭芳)**\nSelecting rare seeds, planting in season,\nNurtured by wind and rain,\nBranches stretch, leaves unfurl.\nOnly when fully grown may they be harvested—\nThe pond’s edges turn green with new shoots.\nHow others envy their freshness and purity,\nTheir tender, plump skins.\n\nLet them be spun into fine threads,\nWoven into dense cloth,\nPounded until soft.\nThen, cut and stitched into immortal robes—\nWho else could wear them but me?\n\nWhen virtue and practice are complete,\nSix *qian* of silk are exchanged—\nNow your merit truly shines.\n\n---\n**Song: *For Master Lü’s Ritual Invitation to Friends from Jingyang***\nLong have I opened my heart,\nToday’s ritual brings fresh delight.\nAmong friends, there is pure joy.\nWind-companions and cloud-friends gather,\nAll ascending to refine the elixir.\nOnly my old Jingyang brothers remain,\nTheir vision clear and boundless.\n\nI invite all masters and sages,\nWishing to ascend the immortal stage.\nTogether, we uphold the Dao—\nNo need for incense or sandalwood,\nOnly heart-incense burning.\nThe saints have come to observe.\n\nWhen virtue and practice are complete,\nWe shall surely meet in the clouds.\nTonight’s true work brings joy—\nAll will ride the cranes home.\n\n---\n**Song: *For Master Zhan’s Inquiry***\nWith lofty spirit, heart unbound,\nLet no worries or entanglements disturb you.\nCultivate the self, nurture the nature—\nFind joy in what fate offers.\nThis is to uphold the true Dao,\nKindling eternal spirit within.\nEmbrace leisure’s taste,\nAnd you shall dwell in lasting years.\n\nThus, you must clearly understand:\nRefine suffering into elixir,\nPassing it down.\nThen you may wander freely, ever fresh.\nWait until the primal root shines bright—\nThen virtue and practice will be complete.\n\nDo you not see?\nThe path to Penglai is secure—\nThere, you’ll meet both immortals and humans.\n\n---\n**Song: *Gift to a Friend with Doubts***\nThe courtyard lies in disrepair,\nTrees sway in the wind—\nThe walls are crumbling.\nYou say your wife has passed,\nFather and son—what can be done?\nWang Zhe laughed and said,\n*\"Your fate is to find joy in solitude.\nYou still do not see—\nIn the fire-pit, seek not the red furnace.\nCut away all clinging desires,\nSever them utterly.\nWalk with the moon as your neighbor—\nThis is my disciple’s way.\nFollow the steady path to Penglai,\nTranscending birth and death,\nNever falling into the Three Realms.\nIn the depths of white clouds,\nThere lies another heaven.\"*\n\n---\n**Song: *Gift to My Nephew***\nNot born with talent, yet burdened by karma—\nWhy

feels like walking on thin ice.\nCould you ever be a model?\nIf so, you’d surely die—\nYet you earn only hatred.\n\nAnother chain binds you—\nSoon you’ll rise above.\nTurning to the Dao, I wave farewell,\nSeeking friends among clouds and mists.\nThe true news is this:\nThe Penglai path is secure—\nCome, let us ascend together.\n\n---\n**Song: *Huanghe Qing* (黄河清)**\nThe root is deep, the source pure and sealed,\nGuarded in profound stillness.\nWarmth grows within,\nAll cold and rigidity banished.\nA different elegance emerges—\nNow I know I’ve risen beyond control.\nNaturally, eternal

the true incense of the heart.\nTrue stillness—\nOnly clarity,\nStill clearer—\nAbiding in coolness.\nRed, blue, black, white, and yellow.\nFive colors now encircle the jewel-light.\nThis time, it must be permitted—\nAbove the azure void,\nBrilliant without bounds.\n\n---\n**Song: *Qitian Le* (齐天乐)**\nTo cultivate, know the swift path—\nHow to arrange the furnace and kiln?\nTake the *dantian* as treasure,\nAll phenomena in the *baobei* forest—\nAll gathered here,\nBefore the *Ruizhu Gong*,\nFully instructed.\nEmerging with the luminous mind,\nA single divine pearl—\nTumbling.\nBright and clear above the sky,\nThe Jade Emperor’s edict,\nThe green boy solemnly presenting the golden decree.\n\n「This is the conjunction of merit and practice,\nBoth fully paired and matched—auspicious signs

emerging,\nNew medicine’s radiant hue as its companion.\nUnfolding in the fragrant void,\nThe Pure Moon of deep autumn.\nThen, in accordance with the Central Harmony,\nIt must be the night of the full moon’s cycle.\nWorthy of my family’s appreciation,\nJust as it should be—\nInviting branches, welcoming the luminous pavilion.\nCapable of savoring refined beauty,\nDelicate hues spread out,\nIlluminating shadows—\nBoth harmoniously paired.\n\nSuddenly recalling the Luminous Spirit,\nThe Moon Hare’s origin.\nPerfumed and rich, overflowing,\nGraceful and luminous, boundless.\nOn the Seventh and Eighth of the Double Ninth,\nFragrance spreads through the Three Isles,\nLight fills the Ten Lands.\n\n*Turning the Celestial Dipper* (斗鹌鹑)\nA single luminous mind—\nThe material for an

realm,\nTaking birth in a vulgar form.\nOnly fearing this body,\nWine and lust, wealth and gain.\nMingling once more in worldly pleasures,\nThis heart will turn to ashes.\n\nReawakening to the Original Truth,\nThe Wheel of Rebirth turns—\nNo calamity at all.\nGazing again,\nAscending once more to the Jade Terrace.\n\n*Flower Along the Path* (满路花)\nFrom the beginning, the Great Dao,\nMeeting

merit.\nCease chasing the waves’ flow.\nOnly if you return,\nAbandoning infatuation and love of wine.\n\nSlightly knowing the Mysterious and Marvelous,\nGrasping the essence of unbounded freedom,\nUnder the moonlight,\nPlaying with the Pure Wind,\nTogether we shall walk to Penglai’s island.\n\nAll fail to comprehend,\nEach day’s light and time fleeting.\nThe path is the cycle of rebirth,\nThe future’s affairs—\nDark as lacquer in the unseen.\n\nObserving your bearing and demeanor,\nYour youthful spirit is most refined,\nWith much purity,\nLittle greed,\nGood deeds not lost.\n\nHollow emotions and delicate postures,\nJust like bees gathering honey.\nDay and night, busy plucking flowers,\nMixing and blending—\nWho will taste the nectar?\n\nIf you awaken to this,\nTurn back immediately.\nThe path to Penglai,\nWhere the colored clouds end,\nHas a share for those who follow.\n\nOne luminous true nature,\nTwo substances contained within.\nThree inches of the master’s body,\nFour directions of wandering—\nEach invites and requests.\n\nThe Five Emotions and Six Desires,\nAll Seven Orifices connected,\nEight Mountains towering,\nNine Palaces deep,\nHow to attain the Ten Realms?\n\nTenfold cultivation and refinement,\nNine transformations to reach sagehood.\nEight paths surge with ambrosial nectar,\nSeven Gates open—\nCaverns communicating with purity.\nSix streets in five colors,\nFour Symbols fully devoted,\nThree Lights shining,\nTwo Nights following,\nOne luminous pearl gleaming.\n\nAspiring to Dao and cultivating immortality,\nWhy do all bear burdens?\nFalsely coveting the boundless void,\nAll from indulging in external pleasures.\nInner treasures,\nUnrecognized as Non-Doing—\nOnly boasting of strength,\nThen boasting of ability,\nBoasting until it all dissolves.\n\nNot knowing how to begin,\nHow can one firmly establish the foundation?\nEach merely endures hunger and cold,\nBetter to master the interplay of yin and yang.\n\nWhite as pure jade, red as brilliant flame,\nLight and color dazzlingly distinct—\nOne roundness, ten directions of clarity,\nOnly then does the true elixir appear.\n\nYou seek to master it,\nRecognizing the Black and the White Hare.\nAbove and below must harmonize,\nLeft and right—\nThe Dragon and Tiger must intermingle.\n\nPassing down the Great Elixir,\nIt must enter the Red Furnace,\nRefined and transmuted,\nTurning into Silver Frost,\nOne Golden Flower gathered.\n\nFragrance drifts far and wide,\nPiercing through Kunlun’s peaks.\nWafting up to the Azure Void,\nForming clusters of light—\nIlluminating and worthy of beholding.\n\nWithin the Jade Hall,\nConsorting with the Great Luo Immortals,\nSelf-content and joyful,\nObtaining eternal spring,\nNow on the path of unbounded freedom.\n\nPen, ink, and paper,\nThe inkstone as the matter.\nThe first and second hexagrams,\nOne missing—\nDifficult to use.\n\nIn leisure, sitting quietly,\nCounting on fingers and pondering carefully,\nIf one must write,\nNot thinking of it in time,\nMust use the Pure Spring’s water.\n\nJust like the four seasons—\nSpring, summer, autumn, and winter.\nWarmth and cold, heat and chill,\nCombining to form—\nWhat year is to be considered?\n\nOriginally, it ascends,\nWith mysteries beyond measure.\nIn accordance with the True and Mysterious,\nAligning with Heaven’s mechanism,\nThe intercalary month completes the year.\n\nConcentrating the spirit and meditating afar,\nOnly then does the snow within lead solidify.»\n\nNurture the yellow sprout,\nSo the Golden Crow may climb toward the bright moon.\nThe Yellow Mother’s match—\nA different household’s wind,\nWith dragons roaring and tigers snarling—\nWho could distinguish them?\n\nHumans still cling to desire,\nAcid and spice must be savored in moderation.\nTo taste flavors truly,\nLet the Five Agents of the Pure and Empty\nRejoice in their harmony.\n\nGuard the Original Intestine steadfastly,\nNourish the spirit to its divine essence—\nWhen virtue is perfected,\nAscend to the Celestial Gathering,\nDwelling in the world without rest.\n\nThe mortal frame’s four illusions—\nNow is the time to examine them thoroughly.\nLimitation arises from cause and condition—\nWhy not practice earnestly and early?\n\nUnsoiled by dusty toil,\nDisplaying another household’s wind,\nUnentangled, unhampered—\nFor oneself, all vexations are removed.\n\nSlightly enlightened, one resists not\nThe allure of wealth and beauty.\n\nCultivate the Original Spirit—\nThis true principle, this true essence,\nRests upon it.\n\nOn Kunlun’s peak,\nA single spot of unbounded freedom—\nFacing the red haze,\nAchieving self-mastery,\nThe crane leads, bearing the mushroom of immortality.\n\nDissolving the red [passion],\nSighing at the floating world,\nDriven by glory and wealth,\nChased by fame and gain—\nAll vie in deceitful schemes,\nJealousy ever growing,\nCunning multiplying in imitation.\n\nAll are greedy—\nWhen does it ever cease?\nEach boasts of daughters and sons to serve them.\nMore lost in wine and song,\nHoping for endless fulfillment—\nYet who knows seventy years may not be granted?\n\nEven if a hundred years are allotted,\nThere is no escape.\nAwaken early—\nThe path ahead is not as desired.\nTurn back swiftly,\nAnd only then may one escape birth and death.\n\nSeek the Mysterious, investigate the subtle,\nSearch the profound and fathom the hidden.\nTake naturally the dual completeness of spirit and qi,\nRevealing clearly—\nThe Original Beginning’s true, round nature,\nThus it is:\nJade features, jade complexion, strange and wondrous.\nGlowing with gemstone radiance,\nPearlescent hues emitting auspicious omens.\nThe Golden Elixir formed in empty space,\nDwelling in purity,\nAscending to the Great Luo’s celestial rank.\n\nFrozen clouds congeal.\nAccumulated pearls and jade—\nAuspicious omens meet in kind.\nLightly cast and dancing,\nThe wind’s blade shears in swirling patterns.\nIn an instant, spread across—\nFields, rivers, and mountain streams.\nIncluding the Yang Valley,\nLonely bridges and fords—\nAll are visible.\n\nFacing this evening scene,\nWorthy of painting by the riverbank.\nThree or four fishermen laugh at each other,\nCloaked and hooded, their songs ringing.\nPointing to tavern flags, they gather to drink.\nWide locks of hair adorned,\nGardens and paths of the woodcutter—\nEven more bewitching,\nDistant flocks of egrets and herons.\nOutshining the white crane,\nWorthy of the white pheasant’s elegance.\n\nAfter the evening mist clears,\nThe slanted sun glows with silvered clouds.\nThe gate welcomes its light,\nAs if a jade palace of immortals.\nA natural Zhurong arrives,\nRadiant and resplendent.\nPiercing the void beyond,\nKunlun’s gems are arrayed.\n\nWhen night is still and the clear sky gleams,\nA single wheel of bright moon ascends,\nIts light intermingling.\n\n**Tail Note:**\nThe world is entirely deluded,\nClinging to wealth and beauty,\nNone escape error.\n\nOne with sincere elixir-making,\nSeizing the moment of ease—\nThe Four Seasons ever pursue pleasure,\nEver more frequent in their folly,\nLike moths drawn to flame,\nEver seeking refuge in the light.\nOnly then do they awaken—\nHow can they undo their burned bodies?\n\nRegret comes too late—\nAlready scorched by suffering.\nAvoiding harm now,\nHow can one escape future calamity?\nPreserving the body intact,\nHow can one endure the searing?\n\nLook within—\nBound only by fame, wealth, and glory.\n\n**Dissolving Sorrow:**\nWorthy of lament—\nThe world’s confusion grows ever deeper,\nHow can one escape its snares?\nAll are equal in their praise,\nGathering and dispersing in turn.\nEndless scheming,\nA hundredfold entanglements.\nThese demonic messengers\nCalculate your fate in secret.\nWait until it’s too late to see.\n\nFoolish mortals.\n\nThe reckless race—\nClever, nimble, bold,\nUnchecked in arrogance.\nThey meet the Sage with deceit,\nIgnoring the divine, playing with the numinous.\nThis is but the karmic thread they weave—\nHow can they evade it?\nEven escape is futile.\nSee the summons—\nEach adds to their torment and woe.\nAll judgments are sealed by the underworld’s decree.\n\nThe green-headed duck#2 sighs at life’s fleeting light,\nChasing glory with swift haste.\nLet not fame and name ensnare you—\nNo need for ceaseless toil.\nThis splendor, when it appears,\nIs like a candle flame—\nNever lasting, never firm.\nTime presses like jade wheels turning,\nGold flees like swift winds,\nWhile sorrow clings, relentless and tight.\n\nBehold the transient world—\nPushed along through borrowed time,\nAs seasons shift and years flow.\nAll must abandon, all must let go—\nBetter to plant good roots,\nTo bind fate with virtuous ties.\n\nThe wisdom-blade swings—\nSevering fierce return,\nThe keen intellect strikes—\nPiercing through the virtuous and the wise.\nOne’s own voice can refine elegance,\nOld melodies resonate—\nWorthy to answer this string.\n\nRecognize the primal source,\nSeek the essence ever-present,\nSubtle, profound—all merge into the Mysterious.\nAttaining Oneness,\nEternal spring’s radiance remains,\nAs it ever was.\nNo coming, no going—\nWithin Penglai’s isle,\nA Daoist immortal.\n\nLament the Yellow Flower—\nThe Great Sage often comes to save.\nYet as a mortal, I speak of the lineage.\nA thunderclap beneath the earth,\nShakes rain from the mountain peaks.\nWho knows the iron ox plows the soil?\nKan and Li, Zi and Wu—\nSeizing dragons, capturing tigers.\nSuch deeds—none are truly yours,\nFor fate’s design prevails.\nOutwit the clever traps,\nBut the limit’s number will claim you.\nSee which gate you enter.\n\nMortals must awaken,\nMortals must see.\nIf they fail to wake, fail to know—\nThe clever traps ensnare them still.\nWhen Yama learns of it,\nHe sends a sly messenger.\nTo the underworld’s peaks,\nThey rush in their going.\nMidway, tears flow endlessly.\nThey tell the ghostly attendants,\n“Pause here for now.”\nA small ghost shouts,\n“Do not bury your wrongs.”\nBefore the judge,\nSpeak your full account.\nThe master dwells in the crimson palace,\nPerforming daily rites,\nLocking doors, sealing homes.\nInside, gold is sown—\nEach coin is yours to claim.\nGood fortune regards—\nAwaken now.\nReach the cool retreat,\nWhere thought dissolves entirely.\nWondrous within wonders,\nSecretly revealing the Mysterious Speech.\nComing and returning,\nGoing and returning—\nNever again tread the Penglai path.\n\n**Again, the Ninth Day:**\nA million reds wither,\nAutumn’s edge sharp and lone.\nA different hue—\nCentral splendor, uniquely bright.\nSpare the Yellow Flower,\nAs the Ninth aligns with Heaven’s will.\nPiercing thick frost,\nUnfurling golden blossoms.\nBeside the fence, Yuanming rejoices,\nWhite-clad, he arrives.\nSuddenly—\nA Revere-the-Aged child emerges.\nSeizing the pure fragrance,\nRecognizing the auspicious sign.\nThree branches plucked—\nA Penglai drunkenness.\nThis Revere-the-Aged one,\nNow born in this life.\nLet go of strife,\nBanish sorrow—\nAdrift in ease.\nA single incense suffices—\nNo need for three prostrations.\nNor the Daoist’s hollow rites.\nLaugh at the sly messengers,\nLaugh at the clever ones.\nLaugh at those who vie—\nOfficials, merchants, farmers, scholars.\nOnly I, serene in stillness,\nOnly I, unbound in leisure.\nWherever I tread—\nClouds part beneath my feet.\nThe flower’s heart stirs.\n\nThe eastern dawn gradually ascends,\nAs harmonious brilliance meets refined clarity.\n\nLittle by little, the seasons shift—\nSouthern lands radiant with fiery sun,\nScorching heat, dazzling light.\nGradually, the western realm gathers golden splendor,\nWhile the northern wheel congeals in dense purity.\n\nGradually, enlightenment dawns,\nThe four seasons revealed—\nHow to pluck and refine them?\nGradually, the years slip by in an instant.\n\nGradually, the Daoist landscape emerges,\nWorthy of summoning and embracing.\nGradually, qi and spirit are refined,\nTransformed into elixir—\nEver more harmonized.\n\nGradually, the path ahead unfolds,\nClearly marked—\nClouds part beneath my tread.\nNo longer bound,\nThe Dao’s virtue/power ascends.\n\n---\n**迎春乐春日**\nAt dawn, auspicious qi stirs—\nSpring’s warmth arrives early.\nThe mud ox reveals itself—\nAncient Farmer Cao’s omen.\nWith a graceful jade staff,\nWho compares to me,\nThe Revere-the-Aged Daoist?\n\nFeasting on treasures held close,\nSavoring broad meals of herbs.\nAlready permitted to forge the elixir,\nReturning to Penglai Isle.\n\n---\n**曾梅春#3**\nAmid the dusty world,\nAll vie for beauty’s fleeting grace.\nDisplaying pearls and gold,\nSilks and brocades—\nEmotions woven in embroidery.\nChildren, wives, all gather together,\nMusic and dance in timely pursuit.\nNo rest—\nLast night, tonight,\nEndless layers of delay.\nHow often do they pause,\nTo turn back and awaken?\nOnly when the Dark Lord arrives,\nWill their guilt truly tremble.\nA thousand sorrowful expressions,\nA hundred grievous thoughts—\nBrows knit like blades.\nSeeing the summons,\nThis regret now,\nCannot be concealed.\n\n---\n**凤栖梧**\nBy nature, I seek stillness,\nClaiming the path of clouds and waters,\nEndless wanderings.\nPolished pearls are washed again,\nConstellations rekindled—\nTheir hues freshly carved.\nWhether seated or roaming,\nIn stillness, I know—\nThere is one who seeks me.\nOften, I meet with golden dew,\nSteadfast on Penglai’s path.\n\n---\n**茶瓶儿**\nFirst, filial piety to the Golden Mother,\nNo power to abandon father or seek parent.\nDaily offerings in baskets and trays,\nRecognizing my own ancestral roots.\nCall to my children—\nRide dragons and tigers,\nNow is the time to serve the Divine.\nAwake and reverent,\nReturning to the Purple Palace,\nRecording names in the Celestial Ledger.\n\n---\n**柳梢青**\nNaturally refined—\nRice’s essence, wheat’s marrow.\nWho can fathom\nThe secrets I know?\nNurturing harmony,\nEnhancing wisdom,\nWith spirit-water’s aid.\nThree luminaries’ radiance spreads,\nAiding the True Yang’s origin.\nForging the elixir,\nBrightly returning to the Primordial Home.\n\n---\n**解佩令**\nThe Golden Lad, sleek and polished,\nThe Jade Maiden, slender and graceful.\nWorthy of shared longevity—\nBoth at twenty-eight.\nWhere do they dwell?\nOne by the water, one in the northern mountains,\nEntering the *Li* gate, the *Kan* door—\nAll are perilous.\nFrequently they pull and search,\nStreet after street,\nEvery quarter reached.\n\n**寻得灵珠**\nFound the spirit pearl,\nWith elixir nectar and spirit-water anointed,\nRadiant with myriad luminous whirls.\n\nThe Wind King’s harm—three times before,\nHe cut taxes in advance.\nFor love of wine, he drowned in drink.\nComing and going, past events forgotten,\nFalling asleep in the street like a virtuous man.\nArmpit cloths and headkerchiefs all abandoned.\nThere are scriptures with hidden precepts within.\nDeep gratitude to the enlightened sage,\nWho, with benevolent heart, lifts them with me—\n*解佩令*—repaying the worthy’s goodwill.\n\nAt the willow pavilion, land deeds placed,\nBuying floating mulberry groves.\nOn the Penglai path, coolness made.\nGradually, efficacy takes hold—\nOn Kunlun’s heights, auspicious signs arise.\nEach island opens three gates,\nWith nine named halls of distinction.\nGradually, the Primordial Void’s silent origin emerges,\nThen the gathered essence reveals the Original Yang.\nPassing through the Hall of Clarity,\nGazing at the blazing scene—\nHere, neighboring brilliance shines forth.\nResiding here, now settled,\nDwelling in the immortal’s Penglai isle—\nSpring’s essence refined, flowers and grasses fresh.\nSummer’s heat blooms the red lotus.\nSuddenly, autumn arrives early,\nAnd cicadas sing in the willow pavilion.\nA gale brings the northern wind,\nScattering white snow across the valleys.\nA hundred years’ time like a flick of the fingers—\nOne true spirit, searching for profound mysteries.\nAfterward, all is complete.\nNurturing harmony of spirit and qi,\nForging the radiant elixir into a perfect sphere.\nThe Five Paths gleam together,\nEscorting ascent to the Great Luo Heaven.\nBy nature, compassionate—\nSeeking the Mysterious Mechanism.\nWondrous principles ascend,\nDesiring to ponder.\nThe body cannot escape—\nDriven by the fires of familial bonds.\nLove and desire fiercely abandoned,\nYet how to leave wife and children behind?\nThis elixir, once formed, splits in two—\nIf forced to act or rest, it follows inevitably.\nBut fear not its control.\nBoth halves united, all learn the Way of Non-Action.\nAt the end of stillness, each finds their place—\nOnly Master Pang knows this.\n\n**耍蛾儿**\nNot knowing how to cultivate—\nJust nurturing an empty belly,\nKidneys, lungs, heart, liver, spleen—\nFive clumps of foul flesh—what master are they?\nFirst, drive away the Yellow Woman.\nConfront the Azure Dragon and White Tiger,\nNo need for infants or maidens.\nGentlemen seeking the path of longevity—\nThere is another gate.\nIf one knows how to cultivate and seek the swift path,\nThe Full Reality’s gate opens wide.\nMercury knows Lead as its ancestor,\nSecuring the essence to halt the vital breath.\nEven the inverted yin-yang numbers—\nToday, clearly explained.\nDepend on these four characters,\nAnd soon you’ll return to the Dao.\n\n**七骑子**\nTruly, Master Zhongyang,\nMet with a fortunate cause.\nThe cause awaits fulfillment—\nCultivate the Dao, become an immortal.\nThe immortals are awake and sincere—\nThe elixir’s single round pearl complete.\nAuspicious clouds bear it to Heaven.\nThe Heavenly Master grants the White Flower Lotus.\nThe Lotus gleams most brightly,\nFreshest, most radiant—\nRadiant and fragrant, wondrous and profound.\nAscending to the Jade Emperor’s presence.\nLeisurely steps drift—\nBeyond the western suburbs.\nSeeing skeletons lie,\nLying on the sandbank.\nAsk why your fate is thus—\nFor love of children, wife, and kin.\nNow suffering bitter wine.\nEyes grow sores, mouths fill with dust.\nQi chokes—cannot exhale,\nExhaling only rainbows.\nRain and wind scatter all—\nMostly, children trample them.\nRegretting no good deeds in life.\n\n---\n*(End of Volume Eleven of Zhongyang’s Full Reality Collection)*\n#1 This tune should be *\"Golden Man Holding the Dew Tray.\"*\n#2 This tune should be

found.\nThis side verdant, that side white,\nA head of black, a crown of crimson bright.\nTogether they dwell in halls of lapis,\nJade-petal blossoms bloom with crushed crystal dew.\nJade boys sing, golden boys clap—\nHeaven’s choice has fallen upon the Guest.\nThis tune’s break, the first break enters—\nThe Guest’s place knows no break.\nExamined, understood—\nSee how it splits my belly wide.\nHow does one do it? Just so—\nWhy sleep through the *ziwu* hours?\nWhat’s said, what’s taught—\nSelf-wrapped in darkness, alone in practice.\nThis *haifeng* wind—my heart is broken,\nA sudden end to this strange discipline.\nNo calamity, no disaster—\nNo seeking, no grasping, no ink-stained scholar’s fate.\nGreat Immortals chant, True Ones respond—\nIn the Full Reality Hall, no smoke, no flame.\nWu-you Child, with three companions,\nInstantly cool, at ease, seated in freedom.\n\n---\n\n**香山会**\nWhite radiance blooms with emerald hue,\nRed splendor gathers in perfection.\nMysterious yellow shines with celestial depth—\nLayer upon layer, pearls draped in splendor.\nThrough boundless skies, Daoists come and go.\nSealed with eternal title, now the Jade Emperor’s decree is received.\nWithin clouds and mists, the True Ones ascend.\nAt the Fragrant Mountain Gathering, pearly words unfold the Way.\nTogether they return to dwell forever in the Three Isles.\n\n---\n\n**红芍药**\nOnly when one is fully awake\nCan one boast of true perfection.\nClear messages are seen—\nNow the perfect midday sleep is taken.\nThis *ziwu* hour compels the spirit’s flow,\nThe Bottle Constellation—how could it be ignored?\nWhen the Jade Door opens, lock the Golden Pass.\nLock the Golden Pass—\nNever meet with lustful winds,\nNor fall to the fires of karma.\nThe Six Realms’ wheel is utterly avoided.\nFree and unbound—\nAbove and below, white qi fills the void,\nA single elixir grain, forged into gold.\nFrom the sky, celestial music welcomes,\nHeavenly flowers bloom in perfect order.\n\n---\n\n**塞孤**\nMy voice alone—who could measure it?\nA maiden with green face, white limbs—\nStone Girl comes to respond.\nSlender her form, her waist like a jade flute,\nSoft and yielding, dancing in graceful sway,\nGold mirrors and pearl strings all at her command.\nLet all be fulfilled, repay this merit.\nAt first scent of jade blossom’s fragrance,\nIt is the crystal flower crushed.\nTwo segments of moss, the same hue—\nEven the Spirit Boys are ordered to pluck.\nTogether they meet—worthy of pity,\nDisplaying wonders beyond measure.\nRising above the Azure Han,\nShe gazes clearly.\nWith new melodies, forever as a Celestial Guest.\n\n---\n\n**双雁儿**\nI urge you to the Western Realm—\nCast off restraint, wander as clouds.\nThen you shall know no sorrow.\nThis worry fades, little by little.\nSlowly, pull back the six oxen.\nRecognize the waters, the grasses—\nYour body becomes pure white through true cultivation.\nAscend in freedom, the boat reaches shore.\n\n---\n**自述**\nThe mind-horse, heart-monkey—do not let them stray.\nThe *haifeng* wind bears my name: Wang Zhe.\nSince my heart broke, I’ve been turned upside down.\nFearful of dissipating old karma.\nTrue nature, true spirit—what more is there to say?\nLike dawn’s wind, the moon’s last light.\nAt the Yang Willow Ravine, all is clear.\nI pluck at will.\n\n---\n**愍郭郎**\nThe Dao’s leisure is its own perfection—\nA carefree little Immortal.\n\n**《谨修增些福》**\nI earnestly cultivate to increase some **virtue/power**—\nDescend into the Yellow Spring.\n\n**Foolish and bewildered**, I know nothing at all,\nOnly love a few coins of money.\nWhen the great limit arrives one day,\nI shall lament to the Azure Sky.\n\n**Lost in delusion**, I follow the **Dao/Way**;\nAt leisure, I wander without hindrance.\nGazing alone at the brocade waves of the **Jinbo**,\nAnd the verdant peaks of the **Qingdai**.\n\nTurning back, I suddenly see beyond the desolate woods—\nA heap of skulls lying, tangled in the reeds.\nWho now owns this lone, pitiful place?\nThey are all **sorting** together.\n\nMy hollow eyes are filled with dust—\nEarthly particles block my sight.\nRain washes, wind blows, sun scorches—\nStars shine in silent opposition.\n\nFor **karmic transformation**, I add layer upon layer,\nHeavily burdened anew.\nIn strange lands and distant realms,\nWhere am I a guest? What age?\n\nThe shepherd boy arrives,\nFrequently striking with his staff,\nDesiring to scatter them.\nIn past lives, I coveted wealth and lust,\nAnd clung to love.\n\n**Lost in delusion**, how can I escape?\nThe **Hongchuang** tune—\n**Liu Yue’s Dao/Way** is sincere and potent.\nAt the **Equal Community**, some recognize, others do not.\n\nThis is the **root of virtue/power**,\nFor the sake of **tranquility and benefit**.\nI wish you would soon accumulate **auspicious causes**.\nSeek the **Dao/Way** within your heart.\n\nIf you boast, you’ll topple like a balanced scale—\nDo not let even a drop slip away.\nGrind ink with a wooden slab and broken tile.\nBefore my window, the bamboo—\nI see its true **effortless grace**.\n\nAsk those who **skillfully point the tea**—\nWho can truly **walk the Dao/Way**?\n**Compassion and mercy** must not be abandoned.\nDo good deeds by striking the cup—\nWhy wait for a silent sound?\n\nAsk those who **abide in freedom and ease**—\nHow does

salt, and pickled greens,\nDried vegetables turned into fermented pastes.\nI entrust them to **Zhang Gong**—\nSteady and firm in your grasp.\nDo not let them slip,\nCrushed beneath your feet.\nA hundred fragments, piece by piece,\nScattered when the time comes.\n\n**Seventy-three, thirty-seven**—\nAt that moment, ponder **Wang Ji, Wang Ji**.\nThe cliffside is perilous, yet firm—\nBut guard against losing your footing.\n\nI urge you to turn back, not to cling.\nThe **headwrap** remains only until\nNext year’s New Year’s Day.\nIf you persist as before—\n**Mind-horse, heart-monkey**—\nYour lifespan will reach ninety.\n\nBut as a mortal, you must rely on **virtue/power**.\nDo not scorn heaven or slight the earth—\nClothing and food will suffice.\n\nThis very night, however,\nThere is a **Wang San**, alone with his parents.\nNo comings or goings, no blankets or quilts.\nSleeping in his clothes, still and serene,\nHe will not stir or be disturbed.\n\nWhen he wakes, he feels even more **cool and refreshed**,\nSpeaking only of poetry and melodies.\nBy next year, he will be **ripe with wisdom**.\nThis **lofty peak of the heart** remains unlit—\nUnfathomable **kalpas** of waves,\nGreedily grasping fame and fortune.\nThe earth turns to gold, yet it is still insufficient.\n\nWhy then do you not **plant good causes**,\nFor a better rebirth?\nDo you not know that **two by two, three by three**,\nWe see **five by five, six by six**?\nTo honor **brother and sister-in-law**,\nTo provide **auspicious offerings**.\n\nEven now, these are my **living parents**—\nWho dares to face them?\nBut here, there is **Wang San**,\nWhom I think of morning and evening.\nBrother and sister-in-law, do not grieve or sigh.\nDo not worry—\nPurify your heart with **sincere reflection**.\nThe **fragrance of fame** is fleeting—\nAll three teachings **observe** it,\nYet **virtuous growth** flourishes.\n\nThis **Wang San** is **worthy of competition**.\nHe has extinguished **greed for wealth and lust**,\nAnd wandered in the **threefold bliss of desire**.\nWhy then do you not **cease offering incense and wine**?\nEven the **Immortal** loves this.\n\n**Walking alone**, he is truly **free and at ease**.\nTo **conceal everywhere**, to **banish all demons**.\nMany **heart sutras**, remembered clearly—\n**No obstruction, no hindrance**.\n\n**Wang Zhe**—\nFrom my beginning,

within,\nThe **true head** that wraps it.\nDaily **practice kindness** as **skillful means**.\n**Cool clarity** resides\nIn **qi and spirit**.\n**Avoid wealth and desire**.\n**Naturally**, the **Great Dao** opens—\nAwakening, **bright and clear**.\nWhen the **Golden Elixir** is perfected,\nYou **cross the illusory ford**.\n\n「Ascend the Cloud Path, gaze upon the Jade Cavern’s Eternal Spring.\nIn the Chrysanthemum Realm—\nFlesh sells pastries, wine sells oil—\nNourish your body, not your gluttony.\nChildren and grandchildren frolic in play.\nGold and silver, jewels and treasures,\nPiled like mountains and hills.\nWhy not seek the Dao’s path instead, leaving this transient world behind?\nFor when your Heavenly allotted span is reached,\nGhostly messengers will come to drag you away.\nOnly then will you realize your lifetime was all in vain—\nNodding, nodding,\nRegretful beyond measure.\n\nI earnestly advise my kin to cease their self-torment,\nKnowing each day they dwell in mortal abodes.\nSleeping until the sun is high—\nOn days when flowers are sold,\nThere lies a deeper, hidden mystery.\nThis place, from the start, is truly magnetic—\nNaturally quenching flames and dispelling smoke.\nTo enter the Path of No-Birth,\nOne must summon the Dao—\nOnly within the heart’s field.\n\nAgain, the spring arrives, yet emptiness remains.\nToday’s handful of gentle breeze\nLets me drift like a wandering reed.\nBefore, I roamed the Cloud-Waters—\nThe Great Path stretches endlessly.\nThough my heart may grow sluggish, my body must not lag,\nFor I know the finest medicine is *Xion* [芎].\nOnce taken, my body grows light and strong—\nWith accumulated virtue and merit,\nI must ascend to the vault of Heaven.\n\n**Preface to *Lín Jiāng Xiān*** [临江仙]:\nTraveling through the capitals, prefectures, and counties,\nAnd further still to towns, villages, and streets—\nNo skill or method can bind their endless chatter.\nAll is truly the same,\nAs the six senses clamor in iron-like discord.\nDo not blame the constant echoes of pure sounds,\nNor those who call you forth from the household gate.\nPolish your heart-mirror, lest it grow dim.\nA full wheel of moonlight shines clear,\nIts light piercing through Kunlun’s heights.\nIf you govern yourself and practice without faltering,\nYour sincere heart will ascend to Heaven’s will.\nWithin, your essence is refined and radiant.\nThe numinous and true are sought with clarity—\nOnly then may you gaze upon the distant.\n\nHold fast with utmost reverence and single-minded devotion,\nIn stillness, pure and wrapped in return.\nRely upon the precepts, never straying.\nThe Nine Mysteries and Seven Ancestors,\nNow join you in ascent together.\n\nMaster the precepts, guard them with constant care,\nBestow virtue upon all—your merit is foremost.\nYour filial heart aligns with the divine.\nEnduring and self-perfected,\nForever gazing upon your ancestral ties.\nThis is the true path of cultivation,\nUnbiased and without faction.\nRelease your heart’s moon to illumine the Golden Lotus.\nFragrant incense ascends to the Azure Han,\nWorthy to offer to the Great Luo Daoists.\n\n**Again, on the Four Symbols** [四象]:\nThe nature of life and death, yin and yang—\nIf these may be discussed,\nThen the heart, spleen, kidneys, and lungs are like a surgeon’s blade.\nFurther still, the south, north, east, and west.\nThe celestial stems and branches—\nJia, Geng, Ding, and Gui,\nThe birds and beasts—Wu, Ju, Hu, and Long.\nChild and Midday harmonize, connecting Mao and You.\nSpring, winter, autumn, and summer walk hand in hand.\nWhite, green, red, and black—\nThe rainbow’s hues are revealed.\nKàn, Lí, Zhèn, and Duí—\nWater, fire, wood, and metal ascend.\n\n**Again, on the Gourd** [葫芦]:\nOne gourd, truly excellent—\nEach day it follows me.\nIts belly is bright, its core is empty.\nIt stores the elixir of jade and essence,\nA taste surpassing even curdled milk.\nDrink it daily, and it remains ever full—\nNo need for coin to buy.\nWith my staff, I lift it to the Cloud-Way.\nBefore the Three Pure Ones,\nI pass through the Millet, Pearl, and Jade.\nThe crimson canopy is raised today once more,\nAnd the pomegranate flowers bloom in time.\nWho in this gathering understands the harm of the wind?\nThe Four *Wú* [梧] know my intent,\nThe Three *Yào* [耀] dispel my misfortune.\nHaving met, do not grow intoxicated—\nWithin the cave, there’s another feast.\nA single cup avoids the wheel of rebirth.\nNaturally, clouds fill my vision—\nWith each step, I reach Penglai.\n\n**Again, a Dao-friend asks about cultivation:**\nPurify yourself, preserve your heart for great goodness,\nEver act with compassion and kindness.\nObserve the virtues of mercy and tranquility often.\nThe profound meanings of the Three Teachings,\nAll are fully realized here.\nRenouncing wife and child is the highest noble,\nAbandoning all wealth and desire is the true feast.\nNourish the five viscera to gain longevity.\nMerit fulfilled and virtue complete—\nWith a straightforward nature, you enter the Daoists’ hall.\n\nThe *Tàiyī Hùnyuán* [太一混元] true scriptures of the Dao,\nWith a clear heart and sharp essence, practice with resolve.\nFirst ensnare your own demonic corpse.\nThe Two *Xiāng* [香] lead to the upper realm,\nTheir power quietly applied.\nRescue lost souls, dissolve past karmas—\nSeeing them preserved, you gain boundless blessings.\nGhosts tremble, spirits are awestruck by the pursuit.\nThe merit is evident—\nSoon, colored clouds will follow you.»\n\n「Drink the golden waves of the Western River’s water,\nEach morning using this to swirl and cleanse.\nIts cycle flows and turns back to pure spring.\nThe flesh and skin grow luminous and clear,\nLongevity’s measure is prolonged.\nThe Northern Dipper naturally binds your lineage,\nThe Southern Star grants a birth for long years.\n\nTo reduce wealth and curb desires is the cause and condition—\nTo take Heaven as your reliance,\nAbandon the world to become an Immortal.\n\nAgain, **目贻** [Mùyí]—\nWhy do you love alcohol so madly, like a gust of wind?\nIt is not because of foolishness, nor do you hold it so lightly.\nThis Daoist vision sees most clearly.\nThe Three Paths at the crown become manifest,\nYou gain companionship with the Daoist’s way.\n\nThe Three Teachings’ mysteries are profound and vast,\nYet still you cultivate their wondrous principles.\nThe Qilin first awakens to Zhongni’s [仲尼] cup,\nThe Azure Goat speaks to Yinxi’s [尹喜] insight,\nThe Relic calls to the Attendant Oriole [眷莺].\n\nAgain, **题赠道友** [Dìzèng Dàoyǒu]—\n[□□] seeks the marvelous methods of Master Du,\n[□□] first pursues the Dao’s foundation.\n[□□] knows to grasp and modify with urgency.\n[□□]’s affection is severed,\n[□□] then turns back.\n[□□]’s black smoke is all dispelled,\n[□□] emerges without a care.\n[□□]’s friends are clouds and companions are mists.\nOn the [□□]’s path to Peng Island,\nTogether we wander.\n[□□]’s consort is now matched as a pair,\n[□□] rides the tiger and seizes the dragon.\n[□□] sets up a triple-layered pavilion.\n[□□]’s spouse is beautiful,\n[□□] follows with delight.\nBefore noon and after childbirth, [□□] refines,\nThe crimson glow is now complete.\n[□□] dwells in the Vermilion Chamber.\nOn the [□□]’s path beyond the clouds,\n[□□] reaches the Peng Palace.\nIn times of prosperity, [□□] must remain silent,\n[□□]’s clarity earns the name *Dèng* [澄].\n[□□] utterly abandons, utterly lacks power.\nThe [□□]’s pavilion enjoys fine scenery,\n[□□] ascends in reliance.\n\nThe tea of Zhaozhou is of matchless quality,\n[□□]’s enlightenment is as clear as water.\nCloud-friends and mist-companions,\n[□□]’s parting is achieved,\n[□□]’s ascent is now unceasing.\n\n**Dìng Fēng Bō** [定风波]:\nEach day, leisurely roaming west and east,\nLiving in dust, yet passing with the tide of fate.\nFaint and boundless—ancient and modern alike—\nEnshrouded in harm, like a drifting reed in the wind.\nYou only know of ants’ fleeting stirrings,\nI now love the full bloom of the red hall.\nThe *Zhāoyī* [昭一] dispels the darkness of former years,\nEmpty and void, my spirit-refinery pierces the vaulted heavens.\n\nOnce, the first stage at Mount Jia,\nNow, the Minister’s Sea bears its pure waters.\nAgain I cross the Jade Pool, truly attaining,\nAbundant and bright, my head held high—\nMy own voice now recognized.\nMoonlit silver waves and distinct scenery,\nJade tides and crimson currents earn high renown.\nA white lotus rises, one bloom,\nFragrant and clear, it ascends straight into the Great Luo [罗] City.\n\n**Tì Yín Dēng** [剔银灯]:\nNow, I renew my awakening with deep sincerity.»\n\nThe primordial essence, unchanging from the beginning—\nSwiftly cultivate with utmost sincerity,\nFull and perfect, meticulously refined to its true form.\nTransmit the Mysterious and Pass it on.\nThrough refining and tempering, it emerges—\nNaturally serene and pure.\nA single luminous pearl, worthy of reverence,\nNow polished to radiant clarity.\nWithout the Original Master’s guidance,\nThe Three True Ones would not have arrived,\nNor would the Void-Space Sages gather to rejoice.\nThis celestial maiden’s fate was preordained here.\n**Fēng Mǎ Lìng** [风马令]:\nTame the wind-horse—do not let it run wild.\nOn the long embankment, the *lúdīng* [瑠玎] drips clear.\nAt the trough’s head, the monkey plays its tricks.\nHooves gathered, ears pricked—it stands poised in the wind,\nThe *lúdīng* drips.\nThe tether on the stake is tightly bound to its shoe.\nThis time, you—*lúdīng* gleams.\nWhen fully tamed, lead it back to the White Cloud Cave.\nEven then, it won’t stay—*lúdīng* shines.\n\n**Bǔ Suàn Zǐ** [卜算子·带暍马]:\nFirst glimpsed, the green steel blade,\nWithin the corpse, its mark was set.\nPlanted on wood, a single thread emerged—\nThe *Gān Mǎ* [乾马] foretold,\nAfter harm, the Wind Platform’s fate.\nWith this practice, progress grows daily,\nAgain and again, gathered.\nIn secret joy, only I know—\nThe Celestial Horse gazes,\nProving my eternal life.\n\n**Yòu #2 Yè Yǒu Bù Yù** [又#2谒友不遇]:\nOnce, I saw Master Zhang,\nAsking him to inscribe my heart’s intent.\nKing Rǎn [王喆] comes today, lingering near,\nYet no one stands close enough.\nTurning back, I ride the clear breeze,\nClouds and mist follow my steps.\nReturning to the Full Truth’s old hall,\nI reclaim my luminous clarity.\n\n**Tè Dì Xīn** [特地新]:\nHeaven, Earth, and human life—\nAll gathered here to meet.\nWhat must be made manifest and clear?\nThe Dao’s gate opens,\nThe Release’s gate unfolds,\nThe Confucian path is walkable.\nKnow the Primordial Origin,\nPractice the Primordial Root,\nObserve the Primordial Moment—\nThe Primordial Yang solidifies itself.\nSun, moon, stars—\nAll revolve in their courses.\nOnly when the Void is illuminated,\nDo the *jīng* gates seal,\nThe *qi* gates open,\nThe *shén* gates transcend and reveal.\nDrawing from the Three Powers,\nEstablishing the Three Teachings,\nAttaining the Three Lights—\nThe Three Elixir Treasures converge.\n\n**Quàn Shì** [劝世]:\nShowing off skills and feats,\nThe body displays its forms.\n\n「脱去衣衫，频频更换。 走遍茶坊酒店，总爱夸耀英雄。 忽见天高云淡，这豪情，早已减半。 再劝诸君，莫要迷恋红尘。 保护元阳，切莫让它白白耗散。 轻轻回头，睁开道眼，观看金莲。 玉花绽放，奇香飘来，吐出光明，满空辉煌。\n\n**上林春令** [Shàng Lín Chūn Lìng]:\n云水王三悟三悟，甘河镇祖师遇遇。 元本灵明便惺惺，也真个，诗词做做。\n丹药内中频顾顾，逍遥处三光觑觑。 全得当时害风风，□真个神仙去去。\n晴空如青玉案，放开心月，慧灯明照，两曜交光灿烂。 球装七宝玲珑焕，把性烛当中按。 一对金童呈手段。\n琼杵推转，顺风归去，衮入那蓬莱观。\n\n**带马行** [Dài Mǎ Xíng]:\n亘初独许能骑坐，这骏驷，从牵拖。 直走盘旋双庆贺。\n三山骨健，力筋偏大，马辅佐，万丈红崖过。 谢伊驰出深坑祸，衒玉辔，金缨亸。\n喧嘶风雨游水火。 月华前面，四蹄轻锁，马负荷，与我成因果。\n元初一得从初遇，便端正昭彰着。 转作重阳晨彩煦。\n晴空来往，碧霄堪住，琼马腑，引入长生步。 灵光不动神光聚，便攒簇银霞护。\n满插金花频返顾。 青衣鸾鹤，共同来赴，瑶马驻，般在清凉路。\n\n**缘化子弟** [Yuán Huà Zǐdì]:\n□□锁户真成也，□□百朝，甚惺惺洒。\n□□冰餐非苟且。 □□玄妙，就中超亸，□□马，□□眸粘惹。\n□□恩爱俱齐舍，□□□，闲游冷。 □□教余同幽雅。\n□□仙子，共成修写，□□马，□□明星下。\n\n**瑞鹧鸪** [Ruì Zhègū]:\n昨朝今日与来朝，饮水无加只自浇。 醉后怨铺金藓甲，醒时复采玉芝苗。\n锦衣公子谈三岛，皂帔佳人舞六么。 一曲合成玄妙处，白云片片恣飘飖。\n我咱别有赤穷穷，物物俱无事事通。 清裹清来全寂阒，闲中闲至住虚空。\n能邀迥照堪亲日，会捉轻飙便害风。 此际黑云何处去，莹然衮出一团红。\n三才剖判做辉华，三教分明吐甲芽。 三宝炼烧红焰宝，三车搬运紫河车。\n三峰影裹观真宅，三耀光中是本家。 三岛十洲堪捣药，三清十极聚青霞。\n今朝细细问朱郎，因甚常眠黑鬼房？ 得与青龙为伴侣，亦令白虎助清凉。\n便将铅汞堪成宝，好把刀圭更入钢。 斫断乌龟四只脚，爽邀风月上昆岗。\n堪当姹女嫁丁郎，认得婴儿住癸房。 幸有甲田知出入，不无兑地做炎凉。\n铅刀起处通神妙，汞剑开时仗慧钢。 杀却三尸阴鬼尽，一团红焰覆琼岗。\n白灵根蒂长晴空，碧绿枝条袅细风。 叶禀月华添雅翠，花凭日气蘸殷红。\n四般颜色虽然异，一道馨香分外浓。 透过丹霄归甚处，便教收在蕊珠宫。\n石中火隐怎生昭，水裹金藏要却遭。 石火须凭心火取，水金决得肺金淘。\n火教煅炼真铅汞，金要增添快剑刀。 二件相投成一件，大罗天上列仙曹。\n这回捉住四时春，夺得温和养本真。 跳出世情居异世，尽教人道不凡人。\n何须苦苦调精气，不在区区嗽液津。 莹处晴空开日月，锐然特放九光新。\n\n**踏莎行** [Tà Shā

the structure continues as follows:）\n骏马驰骋，斧劈如风，友情干劲显无穷。\n\n版斧如求，那由选拣，良工欲造无钱换。\nThe sought-after axe—who dares to choose it? A master craftsman longs to forge it, yet lacks the coin to trade.\n\n今朝专礼我华宗，慈悲为首诸公辨。\nToday, I pay homage to our Daoist lineage, where compassion stands foremost—distinguished by all revered masters.\n\n若得坚钢，劈开道眼，灵台熠耀持金简。\nShould I obtain unyielding steel, I shall cleave the Dao’s sacred eye—\nthe luminous spirit platform blazing with golden tablets.\n\n腰间柯烂决忘归，白云路上成家产。\nWith axe-handle rotting at my waist, I forget all return—\nmy fortune lies in the paths where white clouds drift.\n\n---\n**咏镢**\n铁镢神灵，我心有则，随身应手开端的。\nThe iron hoe’s divine might—my heart holds its essence,\never at hand, ready to act at the first opportunity.\n\n种成大药称伊功，栽生善果凭君力。\nCultivated into elixir, its merit is his alone;\nplanted as virtue, its fruit depends on your strength.\n\n锉倒恩山，打摧爱狱，是非烦恼频频雕。\nIt grinds down the Mountain of Grace, shatters the Prison of Affection—\ncarving away the ceaseless carvings of strife and vexation.\n\n锐然敲碎赋玞顽，便令发出昆仑玉。\nSharp strikes shatter the stubborn *fuyu*—\nand lo, Kunlun jade emerges radiant.\n\n---\n**总咏**\n斧锲堪擎，随缘斫冲，钢全生就令分局。\nThe axe and chisel may be wielded—\ncutting as fate dictates, steel whole and ready to divide realms.\n\n一司管刮水中金，一司管伐山头玉。\nOne office scrapes gold from the water’s depths,\nanother fells jade from the mountain’s peak.\n\n窍子方长，攀儿圆促，头头柄柄常相逐。\nThe holes are long and square, the claws round and tight—\neach head and handle ever in pursuit.\n\n劈开金母紫芒攒，判通玉祖红光簇。\nIt splits the Golden Mother’s violet rays,\nand cleaves the Jade Ancestor’s crimson luminosity.\n\n---\n**咏宦途无定**\n名路求高，宦途无定，一来一去缘心性。\nThe path to renown is ever shifting—\nofficialdom’s way is uncertain, coming and going as one’s nature dictates.\n\n稍知分守得优游，能通止足参贤圣。\nA modest understanding of duty brings ease;\nto master restraint is to consort with sages.\n\n莫使偏颇，须存直正，花开须是依时令。\nDo not stray from rectitude—\nuprightness must be preserved, like flowers blooming in season.\n\n日轮耀处吐光辉，月华朗后添清莹。\nWhere the sun’s wheel shines, radiance is cast forth,\nand moonlight brightens with added clarity.\n\n---\n**渔父咏（渔家傲）**\n北海馄鲸人不识，金风长是传消息。\nThe Northern Sea’s leviathan remains unseen by man—\nthe golden winds alone bear its tidings.\n\n予把钓车宁费力。\nI cast my fishing cart—what labor is this?\n\n堪怜忆，香钩掷下离滩侧。\nPity the memory—\nthe fragrant hook cast aside where the shallows end.\n\n吐出神珠光焰赫，化鹏展起垂云翼。\nIt spews forth divine pearls in blazing light,\ntransforming into a *peng* bird, wings trailing clouds.\n\n日在扶摇无有极。\nThe sun ascends the *fuyao*—boundless in its rise.\n\n能搏陆，青霄一举应端直。\nIt can strike the earth—\nwith one leap to the azure heights, upright and true.\n\n---\n**咏假俏汉**\n奸点人人常不逊，外装内喜能谈论。\nThe deceitful mark is ever insolent—\nexternally adorned, inwardly delighted in idle chatter.\n\n艳色衣裳香远喷。\nHis garish robes reek of perfume from afar.\n\n频整顿，重重结裹粗如囤。\nFrequently adjusted, layer upon layer,\nbundled coarsely like a granary’s store.\n\n眼去眉来常骋俊，前攀后拽夸身分。\nHis eyes and brows ever display cunning—\nclimbing forward, dragging behind, boasting of his station.\n\n我便去前·亲去问。\nI step forward to inquire directly.\n\n休风韵，遮藏臭腐并堆粪。\nAvoid his hollow elegance—\nhe conceals rot and piles dung.\n\n---\n**闲题**\n生死轮回何太速，改颜换面人难识。\nThe wheel of life and death turns too swiftly—\nfaces change, and few recognize the shift.\n\n有个风狂常自足。\nThere is one mad with wind, ever self-satisfied.\n\n常自足，逍遥处处孤眠宿。\nEver self-sufficient, he drifts alone,\nsleeping wherever the wind takes him.\n\n愁煞诸公欢折哭，恰如堂下三间屋。\nHe vexes all with his joyous weeping—\nlike three rooms beneath a hall.\n\n屋底你咱烦恼黑。\nWithin those rooms, our vexations fester dark.\n\n烦恼黑，堂中我且燃灯烛。\nVexation’s darkness—\nwhile I light lamps in the hall above.\n\n---\n**赠友人**\n□□名宦为盐判，□□室内同公案。\n[Name] holds office

Friend**\nWang Zhe has already migrated eastward,\nPassing the assembly of sages at Ganhé River.\nInternal hunger and cold still plague my being,\nTravel expenses—beg from the virtuous among you, let them grant their own coins.\n**Perfect forms** (得得) pass one to another,\nEnlightening us both as we emerge from the Nine-Lotus [1].\nHow many hearts now grasp this truth?\nPitying, pitying—this parting carries the **Buddha’s original qi** (本气) onward.\n\nI have now arrived in Nanjing,\nWhere every person in Gānzhèn knows my name.\nRespect the **Three Lights** (三光) and recognize their essence,\nDo not slight the **Five Grains** (五谷) within which the **vital essence** (精) is refined.\nThis journey marks my final course,\nAnd I have set down my life’s own voice in writing.\nIf we

Dwelling in ease, they found contentment naturally, all enjoying longevity and tranquility—this was their harmony with the Dao/Way in its true essence.\n\nYet in later ages, human nature grew corrupted, the Dao/Way vanished and *virtue/power (德)* was lost. The original simplicity scattered, the pure became defiled. Lust and desire gnawed within like maggots, sorrow and grief assailed without like spectral flames. Nature swayed with passions, passions were led astray by external influences—dispersed and never gathered, lost and never returned. The pristine essence was exhausted, souls wandered through life and death, chasing fleeting realms and transient causes, trapped in endless suffering with no hope of escape. Truly, this calls for a long sigh of lamentation!\n\nMaster Zhongyang pitied the *Miaoxing (妙行) True Person*, who was well-versed in the Three Teachings (三教), penetrating the wisdom of a hundred schools. He encountered a sage at Ganhé River (甘河), found a kindred spirit in the East Sea (东海), transformed the virtuous men of three prefectures, and bound the five communities (五社) in harmonious ties. His teachings saved and guided beings, benefiting all sentient life and embracing all things.\n\nThose who heard of his ways held him in reverence and awe. Wherever his staff and sandals passed, people gathered like mist, seeking his instruction. He never refused any who came. His verses, songs, and miscellaneous writings flowed effortlessly from nature, composed spontaneously for every occasion.\n\nHis teachings, broadly speaking, led beings back to sincerity and simplicity, to stillness and emptiness, nurturing the eternal soul’s essence, revealing the wondrous nature of *Suchness (真如)*, recognizing the original face of existence, and restoring them to the eternal constancy of the Dao/Way, returning them to its ineffable mystery.\n\nSomeone once asked the True Person: *\"Among all beings in heaven and earth, though humans are said to be the most refined, are they not just one thing among myriad things? Who can escape the cycles of yin and yang? Who can transcend the workings of creation? All that begins must end, all that lives must die—this is the natural order of things. Without cultivating extraordinary *qi (气)*, immortality cannot be sought. Without aligning with one’s predestined fate, the Dao/Way cannot be learned. How can one exhaust oneself in rigid asceticism, chasing shadows or grasping wind, carving ice or sculpting rotten wood, for something that is inevitably unattainable, striving for an impossible result?\"*\n\nThe True Person sighed deeply and said: *\"The mysteries of eternal life are within all people. Who cannot seek the immortal groves? Those who fail from neglect are indeed numerous and obvious; those who succeed through diligence are few and hidden. The world believes what it sees and doubts what it does not see, thus deeming immortality a distant, unattainable dream.\n\nLet us test this with natural principles: iron can be forged from ore, gold refined from copper. Fish that leap beyond Lüliang (吕梁) become dragons, wildfowl that enter great waters transform into *fenghuang (凤凰)*. Even ice, which melts easily, can endure the summer if concealed; grass, which withers quickly, can survive the winter if covered.\n\nIf humans can sever attachment and abandon greed, maintain humility and hold fast to the One, wander their hearts in serenity, and blend their *qi (气)* with the void, they too can ascend to lofty heights, tread upon the light, ride the breezes of the *Killer Wind (寇)*, and traverse the paths of the *True Person’s blessings (真)*. They can ride the whale across the boundless seas, soar with the phoenix to the azure void, living a thousand years like the crane of Liaodong (辽东), or aging in reverse like the teal of Yè County (叶县). Such beings would stand alongside Anqi (安期) and Xiànmén (羡门), the masters of Hongya (洪崖) and Dongxuan (洞玄), as equals in the ranks of immortals—this would not be difficult.\n\nAcross the ages, those who attained the Dao/Way and moved with ease are countless. Yet I say this without evidence: like the deaf who hear no music, or the blind who see no colors, those with shallow insight and narrow hearing cannot truly speak of the Dao/Way.\"*\n\nThe questioner, humbled and awestruck, fell silent and withdrew.\n\nThe True Person then opened the gates of flexibility, revealed the boundless ocean of compassion, and rescued beings from the burning house of suffering, guiding them across the vast mire of delusion. He showed them the primordial roots of life and death, the harmonious interplay of *qi (气)* and spirit, the unity of existence and non-existence, the merging of emptiness and form in the realm of dual forgetting.\n\nFor those who entered this path, it was as if awakening from the *Southern Grove Dream (南柯梦)*; for those who walked its way, it was like sobering from the *wine of Zhongshan (中山)*. They returned to their original truth, complete and without deficiency, and re-entered the undifferentiated unity; they restored their ancestral Dao/Way, unfallen and unlost, and aligned once more with the primordial beginning.\n\nThe nature of the True One is profound and luminous, ever-adapting through transformation and resonance—nowhere does it fail to harmonize.\n\nAfter the True Person’s ascension, his disciples gathered his remaining works, numbering over a thousand pieces. Their language is vast and profound, their meanings vast and deep, steeped in the true winds of the Dao/Way, containing the wondrous essence of existence. They are the very foundation of true cultivation, the ladder by which others are guided across.\n\nThe Daoist communities of Jingzhao (京兆) raised funds and had them printed, though many in the Eastern Prefectures (东州) who followed the Dao/Way found the journey to obtain them too distant. Master Siu (刘), the *Longevity Sage (长生)*, was a beacon of the teaching, a model of the immortal lineage, the foremost master of his age, and the guide for all four directions.\n\nIt is said that the Complete Way’s teachings arose in the West, flourished in the East, and spread throughout the world—vast and profound indeed! Thus, he commissioned *Lingyun (灵玉)* Cao, *Lingyun (灵玉)* Lái, *Shoudao (守道)* Xú, *Zhenyi (真一)* Liú, *Tongzhen (通真)* Liáng, and *Daoqing (道清)* Zháì, all virtuous masters, to journey specially to my homeland and request this preface from me.",

mountains.\nThe *Du* River scholar sighs in vain at filth,\nThe *Ge* Hall poet mocks in empty wit.\nStill, who knows this truth?\nCast aside tortoise hair and hare’s horn alike.\n\n**Master Yang’s Inquiry**\nSeven feet tall, his frame a borrowed guise,\nHis robes and meals surpass three men’s share.\nDo not boast of his ordinary bones,\nFor his golden form stands six *zhang* high.\nAwakened, he unites the four directions’ mysteries,\nEnlightened, he binds the eastern *Du*’s perfect cause.\nHis transformed body spans a thousand feet—unobstructed,\nTurning the *Dharma* Wheel in the mortal realm.\n\n**Sending Military Judge Brother to Seek the *Anle* Method**\nTo seek true joy, cultivate the root cause,\nOpen your heart and leave behind defilement.\nIn noise, do not let *qi* be wasted,\nIn stillness, let your spirit be fully nourished.\nNaturally, you will recognize the *Three Lights*’ brilliance,\nDecisively harmonize the four seasons’ spring.\nExternally, your form gleams with clarity,\nInternally, your true joy shines—\nMortals unaware, you become an immortal.\n\n**To My Elder Brother**\nWho among kin understands the gold in water?\nIn *Ji Mao* and *Ren Chen*, we each seek our path.\nI have already returned to the old *Yunshui* recluse,\nUrging you: abandon ambition and name.\nThe *En* Mountain’s love, the *Hai*’s depths—when will they be crossed?\nThe *Fire House*’s snares encroach daily.\nDo not be ensnared by earthly slopes,\nFor *Penglai* holds higher, finer peaks.\n\n**Three Essentials for Practice**\nBegging for the *Upper* (alchemical substances),\nWalking the *Middle* (talismans),\nSetting the *Lower* (medicines).\nEmpty without purpose—this is not the way.\nBegging for those who walk talismans and set medicines—\nThese are the three true practices.\nInternally, without purpose, *qi* cannot be refined,\nExternally, labor damages the spirit.\nIf not sought from the origin’s deepest mystery,\nWhere else shall you find the primal cause?\nHere, the *Changshun* scene is uncovered—\nThus, *Xiaoyao* emerges from the six defilements.\n\n**Master Wang’s Request for Release of Life**\nKnowing you can observe your own self,\nAll life is equal—no distinction between us.\nOnly the form differs, yet all may fly and be whole.\nYour virtue matches mountains and rivers’ boundless grace,\nYour *virtue/power* flows like streams of blessing.\nThe *yin* principles are fulfilled—all debts repaid,\nHis immortal years are offered on the celestial altar.\n\n**Inscription for Master Ma’s True Person’s Hall**\nIn person, I seek the *True Sage* at *Kunlun*’s peak,\nWhere ridges and mist lock the *Taihu* void.\nSharp *qi* draws the idle guest,\nHarmful winds welcome the colored clouds to dwell.\nGolden *qi* forges the true spirit’s nature,\nWhite jade contains the original beginning.\nDo not praise *Zhongnan*’s fine scenery—\nWherever the immortals gather, it is as such.\n\n**On the Copulation of Dragon and Tiger**\nDo not ask of Dragon’s child or Tiger’s kin—\nThe single point in your heart is the true teacher.\nAdjust the *qi*, steady the spirit, and call for union,\nWith upright heart and devout essence, nurture warmth.\nEquality is the *Great Dao*’s way,\nPurity and non-retreat bring true compassion.\nEach manifestation reveals the round light,\nGuiding the *Golden Elixir* to gather *Jade Grass*.\n\n**Master Sun’s Inquiry on the Three Teachings**\nThe *Ru*’s gate, the *Release*’s household, and the *Dao*’s path all communicate,\nThe Three Teachings share one ancestral wind.\nAwakened, you know the entering and exiting,\nEnlightened, you perceive the vast and boundless.\nSpirit and *qi* surpass comparison—\nSun, moon, stars, and constellations may align.\nUnderstanding principles, discerning texts clears disputes,\nAbove the clear sky, you observe the empty sky.\n\n**Master Ren’s Inquiry on Original Nature**\nLike gold, like jade, like pearl—\nVivid, five-colored, spread wide.\nTen thousand rays of light remain unseen,\nA clump of dust obscures it all.\nWash and polish to reveal its round form,\nGrind and refine to show its original state.\nNeither extinction nor birth—leisurely radiant,\nOnly then do you reclaim its ancient measure.\n\n**The Wooden Fish**\nHollow, heartless, hung in the hall’s courtyard,\nIts own strikes echo *dang-ding*.\nIts cultivation bears fruit—it draws offerings,\nAwakens monks and nuns to chant the scriptures.\nWater cannot contain its baited line,\nFire cannot free it from its wooden form.\nSuddenly, moonlit wind arrives at dawn,\nBlowing apart its clinging vines—its fragrance lingers.\n\n**Ode to Laziness**\nI laugh at my own laziness, though called \"diligent,\"\nIn dreams, I record the root cause with a brush.\nReturning greetings, I keep my mouth shut,\nSeeing food, though hungry, I do not speak.\nPaper robes, hemp clothes cover my body,\nUnkempt hair, filthy face—yet I preserve the *True*.\nNine years in one sleep before I wake,\nFor fear of toil’s weariness, my spirit dims.\n\n**The Bell**\nCast in the west wind’s likeness,\nSuspended in the void, its form honored.\nEighty-one strikes mark the *Yang*’s *Yao* number,\nOne hundred and eight tolls the *Yin*’s *De* name.\nThus, *Dao* families divide *Zi* and *Wu*,\nAnd *Release*’s children distinguish *Xu* and *Ying*.\nIf those beside you will long endure its service,\nIt is the one who truly knows its own voice.\n\n**Congee of Barley**\nHoneyed clouds, whiter than frost,\nCalled *Yazheng*—its fragrance distinct and pure.",

cry,\nWith rapid drums dispels pestilence and calamity.\nWater droplets fall in measured time, their rhythm true,\nEach clang and toll aligns with fate’s precise decree.\nA hundred years pass in relentless nightly pressure,\nA lifetime’s bloom fades as each night hastens near.\nI urge the poet to awaken early,\nLest the fifth watch’s call steal your clarity.\n\n**Jiang Gong’s Drum Tower**\nIts *jīng* blue form holds the Three *Treasures*’ essence,\nA towering structure built with solemn intent.\nTo let its sound resound beyond the void,\nAnd let its pure tones permeate the world.\nA single strike of true gold’s thunder,\nShakes the Ten Directions to their own accord.\nGreat and small alike bow in reverence,\nEach one attaining *Perfect Enlightenment*.\n\n**On the Zen and Dao**\nIn Zen, the *Dao* is glimpsed yet powerless to act,\nIn *Dao*, Zen’s depths are known—no love nor hate.\nThe adept who masters both is highest of all,\nWhile the one who gains but one is truly a sage.\nWhere *Dao*-emotion deepens, clarity stills the mind,\nWhen Zen’s flavor is pure, the heart’s chaos finds peace.\nNow cease your Zen and *Dao*—both rise as one,\nAnd naturally ascend to that which transcends them.\n\n**Attending the Governor of Dengzhou at the Qingbai Hall**\nWithin the Qingbai Hall, a spring of crystal clear,\nIts depths profound, its waves both limpid and bright.\nEndless it rolls, its flow never ceases,\nSplashing forth to nourish those with destiny’s grace.\nThrough lattice windows, light filters like jade’s essence,\nAt the door, gusts scatter shadows—golden lotus in flight.\nFragrant mist fills the hall, the spirit’s waves converge,\nA pearl of clarity lifted to the azure sky.\n\n**Dawn Awakening**\nI seek the original source—its truth is

steady tread.\n\n**Strolling at Xingqing Pool**\nWith carefree step, I wander through Xingqing’s embrace,\nYet find it but these fleeting illusions’ trace.\nRain flips lotus leaves—pearls burst in splendor,\nWind rolls bamboo tips—jewels cling to branches.\nSpring’s verdant green, summer’s crimson lotus bloom,\nAutumn’s chill clarity, winter’s jade-like gem.\nThrough jade’s transparent depths, the source is sought,\nBut asking of its flow—none know its path.\n\n**At the Zen Gate: The First Rain’s Invitation**\nTo seek the formless, first distinguish east and west,\nTo pierce the mundane, see all as one.\nOn Snowy Peak, I search for *Right Awareness*,\nOn Crimson Cliffs, I play with emptiness.\nThese messages are wrapped in spring’s light,\nThese causes hidden in the moon’s reflection.\nDo not cling to the courtyard’s pine’s shadow,\nYour true nature is your own ancestral wind.\n\n**The Old Monk on Life and Death**\nAll my life, I’ve grasped the *Great Vehicle’s* truth,\nIn harmony with jade’s tones and gold’s voice.\nOn the path of *Right Awareness*, I climb the lofty ridge,\nToward *Bodhi*, I step beyond the mortal slope.\nWith wisdom’s fruit, I taste the

companions,\nIn half the sky, wind and moon my causes.\nTo master *Miaoyuan*—effortless transcendence,\nWisdom must shift as swiftly as it flows.\nThe Master sheds his mortal form,\nAnd here, we speak of years beyond time.\n\n**The Dream**\nIn joyful play, the outer world draws near,\nYet in the midnight slumber, truth reveals itself clear.\nThe Seven *Po* spirits dance with demons’ guile,\nThe Three *Shi* delight in draining life’s vital tide.\nThe mind-monkey is bound—no defilement clings,\nThe thought-horse is captured—no nocturnal wanderings.\nThe four false forms trade in daylight’s fleeting market,\nYet in truth, how different from those who sleep in darkness?\n\n**Master Lü Asks for a *Gold Justified* Verse from the *Diamond Sutra***\nThe *Diamond Sutra’s* first four lines

drink the elixir’s essence,\nTo sustain the spirit, I rest like clouds at ease.\nWhen cultivation’s merit fills the measure,\nThe *Mercury* and *Lead* unite—this world is left behind.\nOnly when the outer dross is purged away,\nShall radiance return in its full, eternal round.\n\n**On *Qinglián* (Purity and Tranquility)**\nLet not the mind’s clarity be strained by turmoil,\nOn nature’s stillness, raise the wisdom’s blade.\nCrush the dust of red passions—find what’s truly gained,\nSplit the void of black ignorance—know the potter’s wheel.\nThrough peaks, the moon’s light is my companion,\nBeyond ridges, lone clouds are my kin.\nAs neighbors in retreat, we part in joy,\nTo wander the Three Isles, seeking peaches of immortality.\n\n**A Layman Jokes of Stealing My Feet**\nFortunate indeed to meet a *Count of My Native Land*,\nWould I dare steal your feet to add to my own?\nYou’ve not yet suffered the Three *Poisons’* anguish,\nI’ve already escaped the *Nine Abysses’* bond.\nMy heart is like the moon—bright and boundless,\nMy nature flows with *Dao*—pure and unfettered.\nThough short my step, long strides shall soon be mine,\nAnd teach the *Eastern Sea’s* soul to circle the world.\n\n**The Inspector of Yandu Asks of Eternal Life**\nYour Excellency’s loyalty shines in your question,\nYet even now, the hour’s struck—one toll to reckon.\nThe five *qi* are clear, their cycles marked,\nThe *Jia* and *Gēng* days reversed—refine the Three *Péng*.\nI seek the golden vessel of ancient lore,\nTo emerge from the fiery furnace of this age’s test.\nNow grasp the

path so hard to trace,\nTurns out to be but the mind’s true, boundless grace.\n\nThe crimson-clad noble roams the hills and streams,\nThe black-hatted sage dives into the furnace’s gleam.\nWhen the white steed snorts, gold echoes in its cry,\nWhere the green ox plows, jade’s luster never dies.\nHeaven-high pillars, earth-rooted radiance gleam,\nThe *Dragon Embrace* and *Terhapa*’s smallest flame.\n\nGreat alchemy’s path knows no end to refinement,\nThe *Cold Furnace*’s folly belongs to my kin.\nPure winds veil the face—*True Qi*’s breath,\nBright moon’s glow reveals the *Cinnabar*’s wealth.\nEver check the old form, ever polish anew,\nAnd pluck fresh likeness from the void’s hue.\n\nA single spark cast into the azure sky,\nPierces the void—its image begins to rise.\nDragon’s roar stirs the tiger’s wrath,\nSnow-waves and winds swirl, tossing in wrath.\nPurifying one soul, adding to its glow,\nHarmonizing two *qi*—their union does bestow.\n\nThe tortoise strides through the waves’ play,\nThe crimson phoenix alights on the peak’s sway.\nOne bright moon wheel, its light so grand,\nIlluminates the *Sanmao*’s peak, where it stands.\nSince first I’ve glimpsed the Dao’s true face,\nToday I know the old self’s embrace.\n\nDetached from the world, a guest of the clouds,\nFree from the dust, no earthly bounds.\nFor once I’ve seized the *Cinnabar*’s core,\nIt’s all been the *Mercury*’s lore.\n\nA spark of clarity returns to the still,\nA rounded light wraps the face—*Golden Wheel*’s thrill.\nThe *Mysterious Pass*’s secret I’ve claimed,\nRefined for *Chongyang*—all darkness tamed.\n\nFrom now on, flames multiply on the wood,\nAnd gold is boiled in the river’s flood.\nWhat god responds to these wonders seen?\nOne *True Soul*—its awe is mine.\n\nGathered as form, dispersed as *qi*,\nIn clear skies, it travels—eternally free.\nThe *Fetal Immortal* dances, becoming divine,\nAll from the right path, the ancient design.\n\nWhy circle the *Dan Field* with gold and tiger’s might?\nNo need for the *Treasure Cauldron*—let the dragon ignite.\nScold the *Lead-Mercury* pair—calm is their due,\nSwap *Yin-Yang*—they’ll grow ever anew.\n\nA streak of red dawn on the mountain’s crest,\nThe returning light shines on the *Azure Crane*’s nest.\nClouds severed, the moon’s radiance is clear,\nThe *Divine Vessel* glides beside the shore’s sheer.\n\nWhen water and fire meet, the path opens wide,\nWood and gold parted—eternal life’s guide.\n*Lead* black, *Mercury* red—south and north divide,\n*White Tiger* and *Green Dragon* shift with *Jia* and *Geng*’s stride.\n\nHold fast to this method—its truth is refined,\nIn the void, a *Jade Silk Pavilion* defined.\nSince the light’s clear, no need for search’s toil,\nNo petty debate on shallow or deep—avoil.\n\nSeated true, the *Child of Midday*’s seen,\nThe *Ding-Ren*’s head reveals the path’s keen.\nFive hues in steps, one *Dao Mystery*’s tide,\nGrasp the void’s marvel—let it be your guide.\n\nInhale and exhale, subtle and fine,\nNurture the *Pearl*—its origin divine.\n*Mother-Child*’s pair follow, hues intertwined,\n*Qi* and *Spirit* converge—lights uniquely aligned.\n\nUpside-down union, secrets revealed,\nTop and bottom’s clash—*Pivot Axis*’s healed.\nTo the deep mountain’s highest peak,\nAlone, I bloom—*Moon Wheel*’s sleek.\n\nFrom the start, I’ve

would counsel those lost in dust:\nSeek the Dao’s fruit, the true cause.\nA spark of insight—then you’ll see:\nBefore the wind, you’re but a heap of dust.\n\nThe Yang should not cling to Yin’s embrace,\nFor Yin will mar your virtue’s base.\nRefine pure Yang—seven treasures born,\nOn the Path of No-Birth, no dust is sworn.\n\nAt leisure, I sit, watching common men,\nEach digging paths where none are then.\nLike fish that cling to water’s flow,\nThey know not dust—yet sink in dust below.\n\nIn this world’s wheel, all turn and turn,\nEach soul’s nature, each cause is earned.\nA hundred years—from womb to dust,\nThe Five Aggregates return to dust.\n\nSteady the Azure Ox, as ancient sages did,\nThe White Ox’s branch—its root is hid.\nConfucius, the Physician, three teachings blend,\nTill fools awaken lest they sink to dust again.\n\nBorn and die—ten thousand souls pass through,\nGood fruit and cause between the two.\nJealousy, greed, pride in wealth and rank—\nI walk apart, beyond your dusty bank.\n\nWho knows the man within the market’s throng?\nDo-nothing, act-nothing—let fate belong.\nWhite clouds guide me, wind and moon my kin,\nFree of toil, I leave the world’s dust behind.\n\nMen come and go, each watching each,\nHearts calculating, each with cause to preach.\nThree Lights shine clear beyond the dust’s veil,\nRevealing form—yet all is dust’s pale tale.\n\n**Reflections on the Water Cloud**\n\nI wandered west to lands afar,\nFound true gold—firm, unyielding star.\nSealed in the Vermilion Palace bright,\nIts glow illuminates, bathed in crimson light.\n\nThe Golden Elixir forms in instant grace,\nNo need for three years, nine transformations’ chase.\nIf peers could grasp this truth before the rest,\nIn Spicy Cloud’s depths, their path is blessed.\n\nAlone before the peak’s true face,\nJade blossoms, fair flowers—scenery’s embrace.\nOne grain of gold becomes the great elixir’s core,\nNo further need—no need to boil, no more.\n\nMysteries profound, yet simple to discern,\nSilent stillness holds the truth to learn.\nSearch out the truth from time’s first spark,\nNo south, no north—no east, no dark.\n\nMaster the true elixir by its name,\nUncover subtle truths—growth will claim.\nFrom then, the tortoise dives into the sea’s blue,\nFire peaks rejoice—Jú Láng’s joy anew.\n\nA true treasure’s light begins to glow,\nFour Symbols yield to Yang’s pure flow.\nFive-leafed golden lotus blooms in splendor wide,\nTen thousand threads of jade unfold with pride.\n\nBefore noon, after child—now clash they meet,\nSeizing golden essence, victory’s feat.\nA mortal head falls swift beneath the blade,\nLifted high—joy to Ding Gong’s aid.\n\nOne golden lotus blooms from birth’s first dawn,\nOnly the sage’s eye may guess its dawn.\nDraw in its scent, take it as your feast,\nMerge the Two Qi—conception’s feast.\n\nTen thousand spirits, sharp and keen,\nDefeat a thousand evils—no need for a guest.\nAlone, its light shines bright as day’s own glow,\nNow known—this place holds pearls of show.\n\nOn Jade Peak, I pluck the spirit mushroom fair,\nVital qi and spirit—rooted there.\nOne point of light, yet radiant bright,\nFive hues of mist entwine in pure delight.\n\nIn stillness, pierce the Five Phases’ cause,\nThus cast off the Four False forms’ embrace.\nReturn to origin—true face revealed,\nWhite clouds ride steady—one immortal steeled.\n\nThe Four False forms now guests to me,\nThe True within—my ancient kin.\nAlone on Three Peaks, who shares my seat?\nClear wind and moon—my three companions meet.\n\nWho dares wield sword or spear with pride?\nDragon and tiger clash—yet I stand defied.\nSeizing the Light-Pearl, one bright gleam,\nDissolves the frost of nine cold winters’ dream.\n\nBeneath White Cloud Hall, the night grows deep,\nFine rain and bells—golden drops weep.\nDrink deep from Penglai’s cup, I sing,\nSlow, the phoenix flute’s sad, sweet ring.\n\nIn practice, first discern what’s true, what’s false,\nSouth, north, east, west—all paths compose.\nWater, fire, wood, metal—none need be,\nOne Light-Pearl gleams from the center’s key.\n\nInner vision finds its kindred soul,\nOn Moonlit Peak, I sing at will.\nTen thousand verses—who can fathom?\nIf understood, the heart grows still.\n\nThe Purple Spirit Mushroom’s shell first sprouts,\nPlucked, then boiled—its virtue brooks.\nJade nectar, fair wine—now mixed with grace,\nSwallowed whole—eternal life’s embrace.\n\nSince I’ve won gold from water’s deep,\nI’ve used the knife to sever all that’s steep.\nOne jade flower blooms toward the sun’s bright face,\nCrystalline Yang reflects the Heaven’s place.\n\nThe Horse-Ape’s caught—now practice’s done,\nAll things perish—none are born, none run.\nWould you strike the drum on painted towers high?\nAt dawn, why ring the metal’s chime so nigh?\n\nIf you would master the elixir’s art,\nPreserve the true spirit—keep it whole and pure.\nLook upon Kunlun’s mountain’s grand display,\nSpicy Cloud’s glow meets Qin’s vast way.\n\nSurname Wang, given name Zhé, style Ming,\nDao name Chongyang—four flavors sing.\nOne nature easily harmed by wind’s deceit,\nA thousand gold won’t buy a high sleep’s retreat.\n\nNow I’ve torn the net of iron true,\nToday I leap from dust’s confining hue.\nWith bright moon’s light, I play my part,\nScattering clouds—good sport to mar the wind’s art.\n\nMysteries deep, yet logic’s thread is spun,\nFrost of silver’s gone—my heart’s undone.\nRide the Iron Ox to plow the Steward’s land,\nIn every plot, gold grains take their stand.\n\nDo not covet rebirth’s fleeting shell,\nPlant in the Jade Pool—let roots compel.\nA white lotus blooms, its scent so clear,\nPierces the Heaven’s heights—no need to fear.\n\nTrue cultivation’s ease, not hard to know,\nDao’s use in observing Heaven’s flow.\nClaim the Two Peaks’ true, boundless realm,\nWang’s flower’s core—its cause is warm.\n\nWithin the Jade Pool, yellow buds unfold,\nJade petals, gold branches—flowers of gold.\nEach bloom, clear and bright, its qi ascends,\nChimes and bells—our family’s ends.\n\nA lifetime’s purity nourishes the Three Fields,\nNow stillness may be rightly heeded.\nThe bright pearl returns to the mountain’s crest,\nClouds and mists bear it to the Great Dao’s rest.\n\nThough you seek echoes beyond the void,\nOr chase the bubbles

bright moon clearly shines upon the jade pool.\nTrue insight into the double meaning’s essence,\nThe first three threes and the last three threes.\n\nNine-nine’s words must be corrected,\nRefining the original nature to its primal source.\nOnly return to yang from yin,\nAnd resolve to pure, elegant chanting.\n\nO Virtuous Ones, O Virtuous Ones,\nGrant me leave to compose *As If in a Dream (如梦令)*.\n\nNine-one’s chill begins with inherent cause,\nThe winter *qi* freely unfurls and expands.\nThere, the fierce cold of the southern lands congeals,\nJust as the mid-winter node arrives.\n\nHidden wonders, hidden wonders,\nWithin lies the new yang’s subtle emergence.\n\nNine-two’s austere yin is piercing,\nWhite snow spread far along its edges.\nYet still it nourishes the numinous root,\nGuiding the yellow sprouts to thorough examination.\n\nAs such, as such,\nThe Northern Sea’s divine tortoise drinks freely.\n\nNine-three’s cornered *qi* accumulates,\nThe water’s face entirely frozen.\nThis nature’s firmest and most steadfast,\nUnfaltering brilliance radiates outward.\n\nAfar it sends, afar it sends,\nReflecting light to distant horizons.\n\nNine-four’s cold wind like an arrow,\nIts might pervades all with ease.\nChasing these demons in flight,\nPraise the auspicious one who sees them fall.\n\nWorthy of envy, worthy of envy,\nHidden yet revealed—one radiant expanse.\n\nNine-five’s Heavenly Pool fully unfrozen,\nThe gentle scene now inviting.\nObserve the ridge-top plum blossoms,\nWarming, already luxuriant.\n\nIncense table, incense table,\nMonopolizing true yang’s half.\n\nNine-six’s *qi* expands and clarifies,\nAscending and descending, harmonizing.\nFlowing universally, it now reveals,\nThe Daoist Sage’s virtue and noble worth.\n\nPatterns and threads, patterns and threads,\nReady to unfurl jade petals, precious blooms.\n\nNine-seven’s gates open to eight veins,\nPiercing through forever, no separation.\nLike exhaling misty vapors,\nRevolving ceaselessly in pristine whiteness—\nUnfathomable, unfathomable,\nOne point at the center, terrifying.\n\nNine-eight’s harmony is complete,\nAll things now aligned and balanced.\nLight shines everywhere,\nDazzling, ever more brilliant—\nConnecting, connecting,\nLengthening into jade branches, jade leaves.\n\nNine-nine’s eightfold seal is locked,\nGathering light like fire.\nFlames form crimson clouds,\nEnveloping the face—heaven’s flowers are perfect.\nCompleted, completed,\nOne luminous pearl, radiant.\n\nNine-nine’s words now perfected,\nWho else but Wang Zhi, named Zhe?\nThe refined name knows its brilliance,\nThe Daoist title *Chongyang* is distinct.\n\nJoyous, joyous,\nOne grain of golden elixir forever sealed.\n\n---\n\n**West River Moon (西江月) – Four Falsehoods (四假)**\n\nWorthy of lament: fire-wind, earth-water,\nFor them, form is forged.\nThey teach humans suffering through daily scriptures,\nPlunging them into perfumed visions and sounds.\nOnly I shake my head, unmoved,\nMorning after morning, dwelling in the Yellow Court.\nNaturally silent and serene, the true spirit gathers.\nFive-colored clouds of light enfold and settle.\n\n---\n\n**Four Falsehoods (四民)**\n\nWorthy of lament: farmers, artisans, merchants, laborers,\nEach boasts skill in their own trade.\nWithin, clever schemes multiply,\nYet still they vie in empty strife.\nOnly I shake my head, unmoved,\nClinging to simplicity and plainness.\nClear as still water, firm as ice,\nTheir own fruit of perfection is assured.\n\n---\n\n**Four Falsehoods (四害)**\n\nWorthy of lament: lust, greed, wealth, *qi*,\nThe world is long ensnared by these.\nAll seek them like roasted fowl,\nTheir minds clouded, their wisdom lost.\nOnly I shake my head, unmoved,\nContent to endure solitude and sorrow.\nIn coarse robes, plain food, and yellow pickled greens,\nI cultivate the embryo of the transcendent.\n\n---\n\n**Four Falsehoods (四方)**\n\nWorthy of lament: east, west, south, north,\nMisguided travelers suffer.\nCome and go as they will in red dust,\nDrawn only by fame and gain.\nOnly I shake my head, unmoved,\nWithin stillness, my essence is fixed and true.\nRefined and gathered, *qi* and spirit harmonize,\nForever joyous in the natural and unadorned.\n\n---\n\n**Four Falsehoods (四时)**\n\nWorthy of lament: spring, winter, autumn, summer,\nStrange flowers and plants vie to bloom.\nThe passing years unnoticed, urging on,\nWhat use is regret when it’s too late?\nOnly I shake my head, unmoved,\nChasing inner virtues, ever near.\nGreen, red, yellow, white, black—pure and bright,\nThe true gold is forged, resounding.\n\n---\n\n**Four Falsehoods (四宝)**\n\nWorthy of lament: brush, inkstone, paper, ink,\nBinding fate with rules and schemes.\nOrdinary scribbles always become texts,\nCalled the \"literary quarters\" with annotations.\nOnly I shake my head, unmoved,\nCommanding the Great Record to trace its origins.\nOne spark of spirit unfurls at will,\nReturning to true suchness, gazing back.\n\n---\n\n**Four Falsehoods (四物)**\n\nWorthy of lament: chess, calligraphy, music, painting,\nEmpty pleasures to delight the eye and soothe the heart.\nWithin, these numinous things are scorned,\nHow can they ever grasp life’s true meaning?\nOnly I shake my head, unmoved,\nWith fate, I sift out the nameless.\nOn the path of eternal life, perfection is proven,\nBeyond the void, spirit-light subtly glows.\n\n---\n\n**Four Falsehoods (四景)**\n\nWorthy of lament: wind, flowers, snow, moon,\nThe world’s affections cling to these.\nPursuing joy and admiration, when will it cease?\nThey fail to see the yin’s just reward.\nOnly I shake my head, unmoved,\nSearching for mysteries profound.\nLuminous, the cause is revealed,\nPrecisely my family’s inherent grace.\n\n---\n\n**Four Falsehoods (四渎)**\n\nWorthy of lament: Yangtze, Yellow, Huai, and Ji rivers,\nEndless currents deceive the foolish.\nFloods and waves meet the sky’s paths,\nOnly flowing from west to east.\nOnly I shake my head, unmoved,\nRolling jade nectar, precious essence.\nThree fields irrigated, forming pearls,\nSeven treasures’ peak—there I reside.\n\n---\n\n**Four Falsehoods (四苦)**\n\nWorthy of lament: birth, old age, sickness, death,\nThe world’s great afflictions, vast and dire.\nAlas, the bitter and the sour only deepen,\nHow can one escape this fate?\nOnly I shake my head, unmoved,\nEven now, I’ll grant them this.\nWithin the jade flowers’ cluster, I behold the precious science,\nFive-colored clouds—there I sit, unshaken.",

      "translated_text": "The scriptures never exhaust their meaning,\nIncense smoke burns in vain, a hollow show.\nWith weary heart and labored strength, anxiety grows,\nExhausting body and mind, leaving only pallor and decay.\n\nWithout wisdom, you frantically seek the fruit of flawlessness,\nUnenlightened, you wander blindly across the bridge of fate.\nOthers’ teachings are endlessly recited,\nYet you dare not uphold your own ancestral Dao.\n\nIn stillness, evil thrives in demonic realms,\nClinging to the middle, you fall into the net of mundane existence.\nFaithfully holding talismans and elixirs—how proper!\nYet you let food and clothing dictate your true needs.\n\nYou boast of emptiness and cold detachment,\nExalting grandeur and dazzling display.\nWinds, flowers, snow, and moon—scenes of sorrow,\nAlcohol, lust, wealth, and arrogance—roots of bondage.\n\nThe gate of affliction opens as you speak of awakening,\nThe path of contention unfolds as you preach liberation.\nMorning and evening, coughs and throat ailments drain you,\nMidday practices scatter like empty wind.\n\nAll these methods are useless—abandon them now.\nFrom this day on, heed only these words.\n\nLet true function arise naturally in serene stillness,\nTrust in compassion to transcend all bounds.\nSilent and tranquil, purity shines forth,\nIn the void’s embrace, darkness harmonizes.\n\nDragons and tigers must not wander the Three Realms,\nInfants and maidens must not dance in vain display.\nMighty roots respond to the strike,\nLonely spirits play their bamboo flutes.\n\nThe Two Forces unite like clay molded,\nThe Five Desires abandoned like carved wood.\nSeize the true sound echoing in emptiness,\nSilence the false roars of your nature.\n\nTwo maidens cast into the gold mine,\nTwo boys enter the jade gourd.\nBreak off the wood’s tip for repeated refining,\nThen open the spring’s waters for repeated rinsing.\n\nGraceful hues defy all adornment,\nClustered forms resist all description.\nTheir appearance dazzles the eye,\nTheir radiance shines like jade and pearl.\n\nReturned to the Dao’s hall, they earn their noble name,\nAllowed only in our gate to be called *A-Jiao*.\n\n*Obtain, obtain, obtain*—\nFree to compose poetry, music, and song.\n\n**Song of Self-Lamentation**\nAh, in my youth, my parents spared no care,\nEver thinking of filial devotion, I strove with all my might.\nYet how could I ever repay such boundless love?\nOnly shallow attachments accumulate in vain.\n\nNow I refuse such weary labor,\nContent in poverty and leisure, selling nothing but high truth.\nDelighted in boundless ease, I nap at noon in blissful repose.\nThe foolish do not grasp my family’s intent,\nNight and day, they scheme in vain.\n\nFour clinging obsessions consume them—\nAlcohol, lust, wealth, and arrogance.\nBetter to let the *Harmful Wind* strike them down,\nFree from worry, far from sorrow.\n\nClouds and waters, green mountains await my joyous roaming,\nI wish to return to the Three Isles, the Ten Directions.\n\nEscape the mundane cage,\nEnter the jade cavern—\nCease this false body’s empty play.\nThen monkeys and horses will all return to nothing,\nAnd only the bright moon remains in use.\n\n**Secret Song of the Dao**\n*Sword-Stalactite, Sword-Stalactite*—how fine!\nHow few can pierce the veil of delusion.\nEven if you claim enlightenment, where shall you go?\nHow shall you bind yourself, how carry yourself?\n\nThis *Sword-Stalactite*—\nIt can drink, too,\nWashing away the tenfold brocade within.\nTen thousand petals, a thousand flowers, ever renewed,\nFive directions’ hues, each with its own rank.\n\nThe *White-Transcending Sword-Stalactite*—\nRound and bright,\nEmitting its own luminous light.\nDazzling yet unmatched,\nEven surpassing the Purple-Gold Elixir.\n\nThis *Sword-Stalactite*—\nIts blade is sharp,\nUnbroken through countless kalpas.\nThe wise see its radiant wisdom,\nThe foolish grow only more confused.\n\nThis *Sword-Stalactite*—\nTruly steel,\nFloating in space, it emits its own light.\nOnly the *Harmful Wind* dares to touch it,\nAnd even then, its essence remains pristine and cool.\n\nThis *Sword-Stalactite*—\nAncient and boundless,\nNeither yin nor yang, neither earth nor dust.\nJust a *lixiangluo*—\nFrom *lixiangluo* comes the lineage’s origin.\n\n**Song of Stability**\nCultivate, and branches bloom anew,\nYet do not chase the light winds—trust in stillness.\nEver bathed in dew and rain, it thrives in emerald green,\nSoft and yielding, it fears no frost nor snow’s decay.\nThus does vitality flourish, qi harmonized.\nDo not rely on scattered pills for virtue’s path,\nNor cling to talismans for transcendence’s hope.\n\nAncestral teachings must be penetrated,\nYour own Dao must be firmly upheld.\nExternal scenes must not intrude, external affairs must cease,\nSearch within for the incense of true essence.\n\nGraceful maidens cast into the gold mine,\nHandsome youths enter the jade gourd.\nOne plants a treasure tree in the ore,\nThe other nurtures the fungus in the vessel.\nTheir union yields three rare virtues,\nTheir meeting dances the Six *Mei*.\n\nTen slender fingers strike the drum,\nSeven gates open to blow the flute.\nThrough raging flames they advance,\nOn surging waves they float.\n\nThe path of true awakening cleanses all filth,\nThe road of perfect fulfillment shines beyond dust.\nCrimson clouds enfold the celestial blue,\nEmerald mists spiral in the azure void.\n\nMysterious and profound, unobstructed,\nAwake and lucid, forever unbound.\n\n**Song of Boundless Ease**\n*Simplified sounds, swift sounds*—\nAbandon wife, forsake child, sever all ties.\nPast affections—no need to lament,\nThe *Harmful Wind* obscures no light.\nGhostly messengers of *Dian* have turned back,\nYour name erased from the Black Register’s rolls.\n\nSpeak with your mouth, act with your heart,\nThe path to Penglai is secure—eternal life awaits.\n\n**Song of Profound Profoundness**\n*Wūzhuō Peak* stands with its ten-thousand-foot staff,\nAt its tip, a child plays in joyous abandon.\nWrapped in clear winds, he leaps in wild delight,\nBefore the bright moon, he boasts of his skill.\n\nAgain and again, he plucks the *màtuó* elixir,\nFrequently tossing the coral cauldron.\nThe elixir and cauldron slip—\nEffort wasted in vain.\n\nParting the silver waves, he gazes at the jade shore,\nAnd there he sees the golden tortoise in the jade vessel.\nQi glows like amber, eyes shine like pearls.\nThe child descends the staff to claim the pearl in vow,\nNot letting the *Lí Dragon* hide it below,\nNor casting it into the clouds—he hurls it to the Azure Void.\n\nObscure and distant, time forgotten,\nFrom this moment, he knows the effortless way.\n\n**Song of the Reached**\nCultivate with wisdom, devise grand strategies,\nSearch and arrange with broad intent.\nThe Eight-Eight Maiden steadies her hands,\nThe Six-Li Gentleman applies his effort.",

then drunk,\nTo song and dance he yields, his mirth unshaken.\nHe smashes open the *Yáng Path* to spread the sacred gem,\nThrough the *Yīn Pass* he emerges, the *lùliú* wheel in hand.\nAscending *Kūn Mountain*, he presents a slice of jade,\nReturning to the great sea, he plays with pearls so bright.\nWith every touch, he grasps the Dao’s profound essence,\nWherever he wanders, he finds paths smooth and clear.\nHis head brims with *Lí Dragon*’s hidden wonders,\nHis feet overflow with *Yáo Flower*—seizing emptiness with ease.\nHe teaches his face to move with boundless grace,\nNurturing his roots through breath, the art of *xīhū*.\nAt *Zhōu Chéng*’s dawn, the true awakening comes,\nThe *Dìduān*’s end reveals the great *Dà Chéngsū*.\nAlone, he shines—no difference in his radiance,\nFive paths’ light unified, none can surpass his splendor.\nLike the *Huánghuā* poet’s single gain,\nOr *Qiáo*’s red crow transforming into twin ducks.\nThe *Sān Dǎo* islands call him to their pure retreat,\nThe *Shí Zhōu* lands unite beneath his guiding step.\nIn stillness, he asks the clouds’ crossroads—only the *Dòngdá* knows,\nAdrift and free, he joins the ranks of immortal paths.\n\n---\n\n**Song of the Gift to a Friend**\n\nWho can summon the sea’s refined *qi*?\nOnly *Zōu Zhèngdào* in the *Nínghǎi* ranks.\nGold waves and silver tides return to their source,\nTo welcome *Pénglái Island*—now revealed in sight.\n*Pénglái Island*, where is it found?\nObscure and distant, touching the boundless sky.\nWho shares this boundless ease with me?\nOnly you, my friend, dwell in this cool, pure place.\nThis cool, pure place—truly it exists,\nWhere the *Qīngtóng* child presents the elixir of long life.\nLet it permeate the four seasons’ spring,\nA single pearl’s light roars like thunder.\nIts light roars like thunder—crimson clouds it spews,\nBlanketing the clear sky with marvelous splendor.\nDescending the spirit waves, it stirs not a ripple,\nSoaring to the celestial heights, its expanse knows no end.\nIts expanse knows no end—truly it is seen,\nMysteries profound, revealed in their play.\nThe cloud-car enters the Azure Void once more,\nOn *Dàluó*’s heights, his alchemy takes form.\nHis alchemy takes form—*yuán gēn* obtained,\nThe gate of *wúwéi*’s great Dao now stands revealed.\nMay you turn back and grasp this truth,\nAscend the path of no leakage, beyond all speech.\n\n---\n\n**Song of the Iron Cauldron**\n\n*Iron Cauldron Song*, *Iron Cauldron Song*,\nFrom its first forging, following the golden method.\nIts belly hollow, yielding

scatter,\nWhen water clears it, blessings of peace ascend.\n*Iron Cauldron* carried, *Iron Cauldron* carried,\nIts ringing strikes the deaf, dispelling ignorance.\nIf one would hear its resonant call,\nNorth or south, east or west—all shall know.\n*Iron Cauldron* new, *Iron Cauldron* new,\nIts inner light and outer glow are kin.\nTo add to the cauldron, one must rely on *jīnyè*’s tide,\nTo blend and harmonize, all depends on *qi* and spirit’s might.\n*Iron Cauldron* wide, *Iron Cauldron* wide,\nWhere *qi* surges, snow drifts in endless tide.\nOnly then does the *Hǔlóng* coil in still embrace,\nWrapping lead and mercury tight on its head.\n*Iron Cauldron* deep, *Iron Cauldron* deep,\nNo dust or defilement can breach its keep.\nIts use is fire that burns the wood above,\nIts practice, gold refined within the water’s love.\n*Iron Cauldron*’s light, *Iron Cauldron*’s light,\nThree lights shine—auspicious signs take flight.\nEach time it’s used, transformations arise,\nWhen left to rest, it cools with tranquil skies.\n*Iron Cauldron* burned, *Iron Cauldron* burned,\nLast night, today, and the morn to come.\nBy seasonal rule, the furnace is set,\nWith time, the jade

harmony.\nLocking the golden gate, the *Bái Yáng* teams form pearls,\n*West River Moon* wraps the lone jade hare,\nIlluminating the path of eternal life.\nWorthy of praise—the clouds rise from his crown,\nSoaring aloft, where wonders abound.\nMysteries profound all radiate in light,\nWithin the cauldron, silver waves ignite.\nAshamed to refine, he turns to gold’s face,\n*Yáo Flower* blooms, dancing in grace.\n*West River Moon* wraps the drink of jade nectar,\nA thousand paths of crimson clouds part.\nWorthy of praise—the wood and gold’s dual form,\n*Jiǎfū Gēngfù* smile with joy.\nTheir laughter’s sweetness echoes in flowing streams,\nA clear current emerges from the ravine.\nNourishing the *huángyá*’s endless growth,\nThey teach white snow to cycle in rebirth.\n*West River Moon* wraps my climb,\nEach step, the silver hare watches my path.\nWorthy of praise—the day’s swift change,\nFrequently wiping the spirit’s hall.\nA single light dispels all dust,\nIts brilliance pierces both inside and out.\nClaiming adrift ease, his flute scatters cold plums,\n*West River Moon* wraps the *guìhuā*’s bloom,\nIts fragrance draws the clean winds to meet.\nWorthy of praise—the white lotus unfurls,\nThree chariots harnessed to the golden ox.\nNaturally, its red splendor covers the peaks,\nNot forged by labor, but by spirit’s light.\nGuarded by the refined glow’s power,\nThe elixir’s done—its radiance lights the divine boat.\n*West River Moon* wraps the sight of *Yíngzhōu*,\nA single strike of the immortal song resounds.\nWorthy of praise—this melody’s grace,\nMoved by the *Shífù*’s stone flute’s embrace.\nOn mountain peaks, they speak of water’s frequent rain,\nIn ocean depths, they whisper of fire’s flame.\nWhen the round brilliance shines true,\nThe pure wind spreads, its gusts unrivaled.\n*West River Moon* wraps the eating of mushrooms’ taste,\nTheir flavors clear—now understood.\nWorthy of praise—this single true nature,\nGained with laughter, the wise

      "translated_text": "**Ode to Departing the World**\n\nThe Earthly Lung, Master Zhòngyáng,\nIs called the Royal Harmonic Wind.\nWhen it comes, the days and months extend,\nWhen it departs, one follows the west or east.\nIt takes the clouds and waters as companions,\nAnd the void and emptiness as neighbors.\nThe true nature of the One Spirit remains,\nNot aligned with the multitude’s minds.\n\n---\n\n**Poem**\n\nTo Wáng Jùn:\n*If you halt halfway, wait until the Royal Harmonic Wind departs, then cease.*\nAdmonish you not to cling to the \"having within, lacking without\"—\n*Without the without, you lose the having within;*\n*With the with, you nurture the jade-flower crown,*\n*And from each crown, you gather the golden lotus head.*\n\n---\n\n**Poem**\n\nThe Royal Harmonic Wind repeatedly visits the Lotus Sect,\nFor the Three Teachings, only your Daoist discourse is shared.\nAt this moment, we meet in perfect harmony above and below,\nIn the midst, our gathering aligns with each’s own west or east.\nKnow that winter solstice yields the green and white,\nAnd spring equinox reveals the crimson and verdant.\nSwiftly, the Three Lights may be grasped if wisdom dawns,\nHastily, the Four Illusions dissolve into emptiness.\nA single round and luminous essence suffuses all things,\nYet the myriad forms conceal it utterly.\nThe awakened nature naturally flows like water in stillness,\nThe enlightened mind enters the hundred-blooming flowers.\nEach illusion shattered still returns to the marvelous,\nEach return reveals the ultimate end.\nFood and drink merely sate the hunger—two wondrous means,\nBefore you, the jade-like lingzong stands clear.\n\nTo the Daoist Assembly:\n*All know that the long and the Dao are neighbors,*\n*Seeking the profound and profound, you bind kinship.*\nDo not forget the Three Teachings’ logic,\nNor abandon the eternal spring of Complete Perfection.\nNurture the Original Qi to ever fill,\nSecure the Spirit Essence to never leak.\nThe Nineteenfold Radiance as my wish,\nDare I invite you to join in boundless joy?\n\n**On the Celestial Realm:**\n*Seizing its true essence, search ends in absolute clarity,*\n*Each form dissolved, yet none intrude.*\nThe Jade Retreat’s depths are naturally serene,\nWhite clouds drift without intent, their comings and goings.\nThe swelling moon enhances its splendor,\nFine breezes carry melodies of virtue.\nWith languid gaze, I observe Pan Yue’s prose,\nWith leisurely touch, I stroke Bo Ya’s zither.\nOutside, the flowers and strolling crowds grow still,\nWithin, the herbs and elixirs gather close.\nThe Three Fields must return to their supreme treasure,\nThe One Nature ascends to lofty peaks.\nNurturing the phantom body as bright as light,\nDancing the prenatal sage like wind and song.\nVanished and silent in endless twilight,\nEternal stillness guards the water’s gold within.\n\n**On the Question of Dreams:**\n*Capturing the mind-monkey, taming the spirit-god,*\n*There is no dream-distress when the true nature is held.*\nThe tail’s root remains motionless, preserving vital essence,\nThe kidney’s sea ever replenishes the silver waters of the Primordial.\nInternally, this fosters heightened awareness,\nExternally, it nourishes the body’s life.\nWidely practicing rituals and incantations to save all,\nYou attain the carefree shore-dweller’s ease.\nTo Master Wáng:\n*Seeking the Dao in practice requires no teacher,*\n*Only self-knowledge within the heart.*\nIn purity, wisdom ever grows,\nIn seclusion, compassion naturally arises.\nCarrying firewood, fetching water—only the sound matters,\nGazing at forms, pondering thoughts—each does as they will.\nReducing food to forget the self is noble generosity,\nEmbracing joy to take delight is true cultivation.\nHealing others with medicine brings supreme merit,\nAvoiding wine and meat is most fitting conduct.\nWait until the gate opens to reveal the Host’s nature,\nThen follow the fateful thread to its end.\n\n**On Internal Matters:**\n*In cultivation’s logic, speak with careful emphasis,*\n*Only the heart’s stillness and clarity suffice.*\nWhen the eye’s vision ceases, the dragon rests within,\nWhen the nostril’s block is lifted, the tiger lingers no more.\nThe tongue retreats from taste, the mind and spirit rejoice,\nThe ears release sound, the kidney’s waters grow clear.\nNorth and south harmonize as one body,\nEast and west merge, extinguishing the Three Passions.\nWood and metal vie in the coiled abdomen’s realm,\nThe prenatal sage follows, moving freely at will.\nThe Golden Elixir forms at the crown’s apex,\nFive radiant lights illuminate the Dao’s rainbow canopy.\n\n**On Drinking and Gambling:**\n*The heart drifts in idle amusement, lost in fleeting pleasures,*\n*Unrestrained abandon leads to the brink of ruin.*\nDo not let drinking sever filial piety,\nNor let gambling disrupt your household.\nThe Daoist path is best entered with reverence,\nThe royal law must be followed without extravagance.\nEquality in action brings ease,\nAnd you may join me in the misty peaks.\n\n**To the Scholar on Learning:**\n*Zài Yǔ’s midday slumber is unbearable to behold,*\n*Wasting light and time in sleep and gluttony.*\nDiligence in a humble dwelling brings no shame,\nIn a thatched hall, cultivation seeks no comfort.\nSnow reflected through the window brings constant joy,\nHead suspended in meditation finds its own delight.\nGreat ambition need not cling to a single treasure,\nSun Bin’s wisdom suits the study of Ní Kuān.\n\n**To Master Xiǎo Dá:**\n*Unlock the original essence, and clarity comes naturally,*\n*Release the true light, and all attachments vanish.*\nThe Three Treasures must converge to perfect awareness,\nThe One Spirit fears no obstruction in its completion.\nMastering subtle applications requires purity and stillness,\nRecognizing the profound depends on clarity and refinement.\nFit to be a carefree guest beyond the clouds,\nTreading the path of longevity toward the fore.\n\n**Self-Narrative:**\n*Crimson agate hangs in the silent void,*\n*Deep stillness and mystery before my eyes.*\nWith mother-of-pearl, I fortify the elixir chamber,\nAnd with amber, I till the Field of Regeneration.\nFour precious treasures securely gathered,\nThe Three Radiances transmitted with utmost care.\nThis method, once attained, transcends the empty world,\nIn the depths of the rainbow, I tread the Golden Lotus.\n\n**On Life and Death:**\n*Ever know contentment to roam freely,*\n*Do not cling deeply to the fire’s pit.*\nThe nature above is clear—two paths divide,\nBefore noon, recognize the Host’s true form.\nThe One True Essence reveals its luminous structure,\nThe Seven Orifices breathe the auspicious Qi.\nPalming compassion and mercy, you transcend the Dharma-realm,\nOn the path of cool clarity, you attain eternal life.*\n\n**To a Friend Who Offers Wine:**\n*Though the road ascends without my bidding,*\n*The mist and clouds summon my nature to awaken.*\nTen thousand miles of clear wind as constant companion,\nOne wheel of bright moon as ever-present disciple.\nMountains green and waters blue, step by step they guide,\nWine white and barley yellow, turn by turn they beckon.\nTonight’s cup, if taken with intent,\nUnleashes the red flame to illuminate the ice-cup’s depths.*\n\n**To a Friend Seeking Quietude:**\n*Black clouds disperse, the moon shines ever clearer,*\n*Illuminating the dusty world, extinguishing all sentient longing.*\nNo more afflictions arise when perfect wisdom is held,\nNo more quarrels remain when the deep pit of duality is crossed.\nAbove the peaks, a subtle breeze arrives,\nWithin the heart, I welcome the light snow.\nThe recluse who faces the wall knows this flavor,\nOn the carefree path, they attain the round and perfect.\n\n**On Transient Glory:**\n*Not clinging to honor and splendor is a virtuous cause,*\n*Distant and detached, your vision grows ever new.*",

within or without?\nThe pupil steadied cannot see the Dao,\nA child sits upright, yet does not perceive form.\nIf a teacher meets you with a golden needle,\nHe will scrape away the dust—your wisdom eye will shine bright.\n\n**Self-Realization:**\nTeeth fallen, hair gray, my aged frame remains,\nYet the original spirit clings to foolishness still.\nIn the market’s hustle, I earn my daily bread,\nOn the mountain’s heights, I bear the moon’s solitude alone.\nDispelling the waters, the fire’s essence is revealed,\nParting the smoke, I point to the ice-cup’s lake.\nFrom this moment, my crimson clouds unfurl,\nTreading upon pure yin, this wheel of darkness is shattered.\n\n**On the Sword:**\nAwakened, the treasure-sword is clearest of all,\nSharpened and polished, it stands mute before me.\nLifted high, it splits the new Dao’s eye,\nA single stroke severs the old entanglements of the heart.\nDawn reveals its pristine, unstained brilliance,\nNight emits its radiance with resounding clarity.\nIt repels demonic forces and malevolent qi,\nAll dissolve into formlessness beyond the void.\n\n**Composed at Comrade Zheng’s Residence:**\nToday, on this clear and bright water hall,\nA dwelling place where all may dwell in perfect ease.\nChildren, grandchildren, wives—all rejoice in harmony,\nTheir virtue as fragrant as the lotus on the Dao’s path.\nRetreating from self to serve others is Comrade Zheng’s way,\nResting the mind in goodness surpasses scriptural study.\nWhen fortune arrives, we dwell beyond green mountains,\nA thousand *li* of white clouds as our painted screen.\nLast night, I dreamed the Eight Immortals called,\nThey bestowed robes of *luan* and jade embroidery.\nSpread out scrolls of barbarian silk, richly embroidered,\nA single elephant-tusk flute wafts clouds and mist.\nI widely impart teachings to open the heart’s ground,\nWriting verses and poems to sow fields of merit.\nWho can fathom the secrets of celestial mechanism?\nOnly the *Harmful Wind* can transmit its essence alone.\n\n**Hearing the Oriole’s Song:**\nToday, the twenty-eighth of the third month,\nA sudden oriole’s cry pierces my ear.\nI open the Dao’s eye to behold it—\nIts feathers newly brushed with gold.\nIt turns and sings its pure, clear notes,\nIts intent, I think, aligns with my own heart.\nLike a *qin* just tuned to its finest pitch,\nEven the wind and moon, without sentiment, are its audience.\n\n**Early Spring:**\nThe world’s net unravels—no dust to stain,\nThe garden blooms like a spring within a cave.\nDo you still recognize the carefree traveler?\nDo I not dwell in effortless ease?\nVerses flow as I sit, one after another,\nDrunk, I raise the wine cup again and again.\nThe four seasons’ flowers bloom in their own splendor,\nYet only this pure fragrance remains equal.\nThe mundane cage is left far behind,\nWho today knows the spring beyond the world?\nIf one clings to the embroidered sash,\nThey have already become a carefree recluse.\nPoetry spreads through the brush’s swift strokes,\nWine glides through the fragrant cup, ever anew.\nRecognize the ancestors’ true ground,\nGolden sprouts nourished throughout the garden’s expanse.\n\n**Inscribed on a Friend’s Tower:**\nDeeply I envy the child’s joy in driving the ox,\nNo need for adornment, no rush to comb the hair.\nLeisure is the true kin of incense’s sacred flame,\nLabor’s toil knows not the distant, boundless ease.\nThough the *Penglai* Isles lie but a step away,\nThe carefree path to the Purple Palace I’ve already trod.\nLetting go of the River of Love brings utmost purity,\nThe light carriage glides across the Ten Realms.\n**To a Friend on the Snow:**\nScarlet clouds thicken, the white sand chills—\nDancing in the void, they blind the eye’s reach.\nAuspicious omens fill the measure of a foot,\nThe six-petaled flower blooms as prophecy.\nBeyond the scene, the painted image returns to the fisherman,\nWithin the radiance, purity belongs to the immortals.\nAs evening falls, the moon clears the dense mist,\nA single stream of light illuminates the white clouds.\n\n**To My Nephew:**\nA new poem for my seventh brother,\nMy words are earnest—do not waste your days.\nUphold the nation’s laws, ponder righteousness,\nGuard the military gates, protect the armor and spear.\nIn shared meals, let courtesy prevail,\nIn speech and song, let humility lead.\nPrioritizing others is the wisest path,\nSoon you shall return, singing triumphant songs.\n\n**On My Elder Brother’s Birthday:**\nAuspicious clouds and mists give birth to the virtuous,\nAt five hundred years, the third month’s encounter is most wondrous.\nThe eleventh day’s hour is uniquely rare,\nThree thousand years have passed since the peach blossoms first bore fruit.\nDo not refuse the golden *xueliang* wine—add more,\nLet the jade censer’s incense burn full and bright.\nI raise my cup in toast—none can compare,\nToday, as your younger brother, I speak with care.\nIf compared to gold and jade, they may be lacking,\nIf compared to rivers and seas, they are not exhausted.\nIf compared to iron and stone, they may be shattered,\nIf compared to pines and cypresses, they may be bent.\nYet my brother’s longevity surpasses all—\nEndless, unbroken, never to fade.\nMidday has passed the radiant sun’s peak,\nTender green and delicate red mark the forbidden smoke.\nThe true fire of purity is now revealed,\nNot lost in the murky wine—his Dao is firm.\nKnowing his singular nature brings eternal life,\nWhy shame the mortal frame with its old rags?\nThe swallow’s murmurs are all enchanting,\nThe oriole’s trills gaze upon the virtuous child.\nWho among the Three Fields recognizes the treasure within emptiness?\nThe Four Deceptions I alone perceive on the mountain’s heights.\nIf one reverses the Five Phases’ order,\nEven today, one may meet the immortals.\n\n**Reflections:**\nLeisurely, leisurely, I take up the brush,\nRevealing the Four Worthies within the study hall.\nThe inkstone boy adds water with a child’s delight,\nThe red-robed maiden grinds the ink with ancient skill.\nThe silver-haired youth transmits the script,\nThe green-browed maiden spreads the brocade paper.\nNinefold transformations arrange the true jade’s glow,\nA single stroke completes the pearl’s perfection.\nBright light gathers in a thousand gleaming forms,\nVibrant hues cluster in five resplendent colors.",
      "overlap_context": "he dusty world, extinguishing all sentient longing.*\nNo more afflictions arise when perfect wisdom is held,\nNo more quarrels remain when the deep pit of duality is crossed.\nAbove the peaks, a subtle breeze arrives,\nWithin the heart, I welcome the light snow.\nThe recluse who faces the wall knows this flavor,\nOn the carefree path, they attain the round and perfect.\n\n**On Transient Glory:**\n*Not clinging to honor and splendor is a virtuous cause,*\n*Distant and detached, your vision grows ever new.*",

      "translated_text": "The **Celestial Master’s** lofty ascent—\nTenfold worthy to offer the Great Dao’s saints.\nThe Wind King’s harm retreats to distant peaks,\nTrusting feet like clouds near the Ocean’s bounds.\n\nEight hundred deeds bear twin trees’ fruit,\nThree thousand merits thunder in one voice.\nNo lust for steeds nor worldly cravings rise,\nNor monkey-minds to plunder mortal wealth.\nWealth and desire both may vanish clean,\nYet wealth and desire need not cling to me.\nForever banished from the Yellow Springs’ fall,\nLong since turned back—now the Dao’s eye opens wide.\nWherever the Azure Mists gleam bright,\nI follow wind and moon past the Jade Terrace.\n\n---\n**To Li Dao Friend**\nYour leisure knows no bound, your joy unbound—\nThe Dao is whole, the world’s dust cast aside.\nYour verses shine like banished immortals’ words,\nYour spirit echoes Laozi’s ancient home.\nYet know the literary heights of Han Yu,\nAnd the lute hall’s bond with Bo Ya’s tune.\nDoes Rong Qiao still walk this earth?\nLet us return to Penglai, striding on clouds.\n\n---\n**Continuing the Rhyme**\nFrom cloud-roots rise, unbound by mortal span,\nEverywhere the wind and moon’s bright play.\nTwo cranes cross the water—mine to ride,\nThe Qichuan scene now mine to claim.\nClear and empty qi, by Master’s guidance,\nSerene and pure—yet I fall short of Yi Ya’s grace.\nAdrift in ease, I grasp true freedom’s art—\nWhy seek elixirs or feast on morning mist?\n\n---\n**On the Red-Eyed [Saint]**\nWhat sound within your ears now sharpens clear?\nYet eyes like blindness, crimson and unseeing.\nLike monks at first stillness, deep in dhyana’s hold,\nOr the Dao’s first steps—now the work begins.\nInner thoughts dissolve, the spirit dwells serene,\nNo outward musings—emptiness is all.\nThe wild horse tamed, the mind’s monkey bound,\nThe Jade Path at the crown now opens wide.\n\n---\n**On the Charcoal Grinder**\nThe donkey’s strength too weak for the steep path’s climb,\nThe driver’s wrath stirs—his blows rain down.\nOne heart’s fury at the pace too slow,\nTwo hands wield the whip in ceaseless pain.\nYet why not know what’s light and what’s heavy?\nMore suffering comes from this blind strife.\nOh, how cruel—no mercy in his sight!\nThis alone proves karma’s bitter fruit.\n\n---\n**Master Shuo’an’s Transformation of Ma Yu**\nA monk of nameless rank guards stillness here,\nHis verse proclaims:\n*\"Opening and closing—what cause lies deep?\nSilent sitting banishes greed and wrath.*\nThe tower’s horn like spring’s fleeting dream,\nThe waves of Release now reveal true form.\nWhen clarity dawns, the heart is clear—\nWhen faintest ripples stir, the water’s pure.\nTo watch the world’s folly, bound in ignorance,\nThus I stay in the Zen hall, never leave.\nThe Master answers each line with three—\nEight quatrains follow, marking the Eight Consciousnesses.\n\n*Opening and closing—what cause lies deep?\nAll from the eye’s realm, dust’s net undone.\nWhite steeds pass by, too swift to stain,\nWild horses gallop free, unchecked, unbound.\nSilent sitting banishes greed and wrath—\nNo ear for worldly clamor, no embrace.\nNo drum nor string, yet music lingers near,\nNo chord, yet harmony fills the air.\nThe tower’s horn like spring’s fleeting dream,\nBreath alone suffices—no need for speech.\nThis parting bears clear fruit’s promise bright,\nThis life plants seeds of virtue’s worth.\nThe waves of Release now reveal true form—\nTongue’s five tastes never touch the lip.\nThree times serene, in purity alone,\nOne flavor sweet—beyond all price.\nWhen clarity dawns, the heart is clear—\nA single light within the body glows.\nFrom now, stillness and dimness intertwine,\nYet deeper shadows veil the way.\nWhen faintest ripples stir, the water’s pure—\nDesire and thought dissolve, the heart undone.\nLeakless, effortless—true awakening’s rise,\nNeither gain nor loss seals perfection’s close.\nTo watch the world’s folly, bound in ignorance,\nDelusion clings—life and death ensnare.\nNow light returns, the mirror’s gaze,\nThe heart’s true nature grasped in Dao’s embrace.\nThus I stay in the Zen hall, never leave,\nNo defilement clouds the mind’s pure light.\nUnfulfilled still is my vow to save all beings,\nYet Dao’s deep talk I’ll now unfold.\n\n---\n**To the Monk Named Nameless**\nThe Master now has coolness, pure and bright,\nOne nature shines with fortune’s golden light.\nYet ‘Nameless’ suits him best—where does the Buddha dwell?\nWhere is the Sage who first set foot on earth?\n\n---\n**A Friend’s Inquiry**\nSpring’s youth is best for study’s embrace,\nTruth’s logic clear—no need for forced chase.\nIf exams call, then win with might,\nYet honor’s mark already gleams in sight.\nYan the Scholar pens four lines—twelve more follow:\n\n*\"How does the wheel of birth and death unfold?\nRecognize the primal face, unchanging, old.\nThree treasures, five colors gathered near,\nThe path to longevity gleams with misty light.\nTo love or crave—what law can sever ties?\nTrue purity lies in steadfast will.\nAll things, all forms—no grasp, no cling,\nOne round light on jade pools’ surface shine.\nTime’s fleeting as the wind—how long has passed?\nYet none but fools mistake the way.\nIn leisure, seek the truth’s true face,\nThen joy in freedom, unbound, embrace.\nThough years may age this worn-out frame,\nThe True Person within knows no decay.\nDo not cling to outward guise or show,\nThe child’s pure face reveals no shift or sway.\"*\n\n---\n**To the Fisherman**\nThis fish now dances, wild and free,\nScaled in gold, it leaps the spring’s clear stream.\nThree casts with golden hook—it swallows bait,\nOne tug brings saints to feast at table’s edge.\n\n---\n**To the Novice in Practice**\nWhite robes, green sash—fated ties from old,\nBy chance you met me, crossed the mist’s deep flood.\nThough Dao’s depths still veil your path,\nYou’re now a little wayfarer of Penglai’s hall.\n\n---\n**To a Practicing Friend**\nLeap past Yin-Yang’s forge of fate’s design,\nOne heart for the Dao—turn not back again.\nPurity itself is the path to saints,\nOnly in stillness nurture inner light.\n\n---\n**On the Paper Flag**\nIf wind’s favor brings good fortune’s hand,\nEach dawn I win the sun’s high rest.\nHungry, I beg the streets for coins to spend—\nYet only those who give are truly blessed.\n\n---\n**Echoing a Dao Friend’s Verse**\nSeize the true form—no need to ask your years,\nFive thousand words of incense fill the air.\nLofty ease, like swallows in repose,\nI laugh at spirits bright in jade halls’ glow.\n\n---\n**To Liu the Fourth Friend**\nEver distinguish the mirror’s face,\nLest dust obscures the pearl’s bright grace.\nWith fate’s new thread, your form takes shape,\nYet formless body sheds the old.\nIn dreams you met me, speechless, deep in sleep,\nYet know I came to seek the Wind King’s keep.\nStill you crave talk—let’s meet in ice’s chill,\nWhere warmth and cold in stillness dwell.",

      "translated_text": "**On Fate’s Shallow Fortune and Laborious Days**\nFate bestows but little fortune, scarce the causes arise,\nOnly the toils of life’s path drag me through the years.\nIf you wish to dwell in ease and leisure,\nLet your heart remain ever clean—no cares, no restless strife.\n\nLeave but a few words for my ears to hear,\nWait till your life holds nothing left to do.\nThen we may together roam in carefree bliss,\nMeeting immortals in talk of the Unutterable.\n\nA single finger points the way to Eternal Life,\nYet your nature’s fate still binds you tight.\nFrom the first breath, the truth is clear to see,\nWhy fear the future when you’ve already touched the Way?\n\nReflect now on my words—if fate denies,\nIn you alone, let steadfast resolve arise.\nWith honest heart and simple truth untarnished,\nThough no god nor sage, you’ll walk the path of Virtue.\n\nTo ponder chance encounters, fleeting yet fortunate,\nHow could such leisure ever truly be?\nMan finds no joy in burdens—only ease,\nThen let us rise together, hearts aligned in grace.\n\nBetter than not seeing your face at all,\nIs your virtue everlasting, pure and bright.\nAuspicious signs cling close, like pearls untold,\nOne clear gem shines—your mind’s true light.\n\nTo meet my teacher in dreams is but a sleeping sage,\nYet through you, I’ve known this fateful thread.\nIf you still walk this path as I’ve described,\nNo need for fear—just rest in boundless ease.\n\n**The Blossom of the Third Month**\nAt this fair time, the third month’s flower blooms,\nLike sandalwood in heart, like jade in cheek.\nPluck one branch to crown my head and wear,\nAnd follow me to Penglai’s halls of air.\n\n**On the Paper Skull to Warn Ma Yi**\nAh, lament the world where all are bound in sorrow’s net!\nI must now paint a skull to wake the foolish man.\nIn life, he clings to wrongs and bitter deeds,\nTill he meets this fate—then he’ll cease his strife.\n\nTo be a man, one must perceive the dust of toil,\nA pure mind is treasure none can spoil.\nSnatch the pearl from the Lipu Dragon’s maw,\nAnd enter Kunlun’s caves to live in flawless law.\n\n**Ode to the Moon**\nThe waxing moon is gold, the waning silver bright,\nEach half a measure, gold and silver in the night.\nI’ve bound them both to sixteen *liang*—\nHow then do stars divide their weight?\n\n**Ode to the Dwarf Sophora**\nThe Boundless Sage planted dwarf sophora here,\nIts cool shade spreads wide—who else might share?\nToday, I rejoice beneath its branches green,\nRemembering well when first I planted them.\n\n**Visiting the White Deer Hermitage**\nThis hermitage is named for chill and purity’s call,\nWhere white deer once ascended to the Heavens’ hall.\nDo not mock me for coming here, my friend,\nFor I’ve already found my rest in clouds beyond.\n\n**On the Sudden Change in Weather**\nThe Ho family’s words run deep and wide,\nYesterday’s sun, today’s gloom and pride.\nIf Heaven’s will could be counted by man’s hand,\nIt would be neither high nor broad—just like a mortal’s mind.\n\nWhen neither cold nor heat the wind does blow,\nRound golden cakes reflect the light on my robe.\nThe Martial Constellation now guards the Literary,\nAt the Upper Elemental Festival, brighter than its contrary.\n\n**On a Friend’s Pond**\nNaosun’s pond mirrors Han’s ancient marshes,\nBefore its waves, all sound is hushed and stilled.\nYet turn your gaze to where the water murmurs,\nAnd see the wheel of life’s unjust, unending wheel.\n\n**Hearing Cicadas in the Sixth Month**\nThe cicada sheds its black robe, feels its body light,\nAnd becomes a golden one, perched high to sing its might.\nIt’s found true companionship in breezes clear,\nWho else today would hear this voice so new and rare?\n\nThe black cicada’s shell now cast aside,\nIts body rises, lighter by the tide.\nIn tall sophora’s shade, it sits with grace,\nAnd sings in freedom, soft yet full of place.\n\n**Ode to the Mid-Autumn Moon**\nStrange how the sky now presses cold on man,\nYet rises up a golden plate from mist’s remains.\nNot like the usual three-five nights of old,\nI urge you now—do not dismiss this sight, so bold.\n\n**On the Tea Whisk**\nLight and slender, yet its purpose burns so near,\nLong immersed in oil, its truth grows dim and drear.\nThough I love to stir the tea’s bright glow,\nHow could I know the flame would turn and sear my soul?\n\n**Ode to Bamboo**\nWhen moonlight shines, its nodes are gold like scattered flakes,\nWhen breezes touch, its leaves are jade—so crisp, so frail.\nThrough winter’s chill, it stands with virtue’s mark,\nNot like the common grass that bows and falls apart.\n\n**Ode to Tea**\nOnce I saw it at Zhao’s old abode,\nNow Lu Quan serves it in seven cups of joy.\nAfter brewing, where does it go?\nThe wind carries me to Penglai’s shore.\n\n**Giving a Fan to My Nephew to Ward Off Dust**\nYou wash away wine and wool with care,\nI give this frost-laden fan to little Seventh Brother.\nTo clear

less.\n\nHurry, hurry now, to cultivate and rise,\nI’ll paint this skull to mark the path you’ll choose.\nFrom ancient times, men chase what’s vain and bright,\nTill now, they’ve not yet learned to

beings in stature—\nWho can truly know this?\n\nI solemnly inform my wise elder brother,\nNow, for the present moment,\nName and fame, honor and wealth—\nLike fire within stone.\nSwiftly escaping the mortal net,\nSuddenly understanding the removal of self and others.\nFree and unbounded,\nThe True One’s true joy—\nHolding the void.\n\nFeasting on the Shattered Peaches of Penglai,\nThe old path of Penglai,\nTogether we shall walk.\n\n*Rain in the Flower* (花慢)\nGold chrysanthemum just blooming,\nSilver hare gradually emerging,\nNew medicine’s radiant hue as its companion.\nUnfolding in the

themselves.\nFor the sake of the Linglong’s purity,\nEmerging from Penglai,\nDescending here.\n\nExiled to the mortal realm,\nTaking birth in a vulgar form.\nOnly fearing this body,\nWine and lust, wealth and gain.\nMingling once more in worldly pleasures,\nThis heart will turn to ashes.\n\nReawakening to the Original Truth,\nThe Wheel of Rebirth turns—\nNo calamity at all.\nGazing again,\nAscending once more to the Jade Terrace.\n\n*Flower Along the Path* (满路花)\nFrom the beginning, the Great Dao,\nMeeting with principle to form one’s path.\nResiding in the company of wind and

the Jade Hall,\nConsorting with the Great Luo Immortals,\nSelf-content and joyful,\nObtaining eternal spring,\nNow on the path of unbounded freedom.\n\nPen, ink, and paper,\nThe inkstone as the matter.\nThe first and second hexagrams,\nOne missing—\nDifficult to use.\n\nIn leisure, sitting quietly,\nCounting on fingers and pondering carefully,\nIf one must write,\nNot thinking of it in time,\nMust use the Pure Spring’s water.\n\nJust like the four seasons—\nSpring, summer, autumn, and winter.\nWarmth and cold, heat and chill,\nCombining to form—\nWhat year is to be considered?\n\nOriginally, it ascends,\nWith mysteries beyond measure.\nIn accordance with the True and Mysterious,\nAligning with Heaven’s mechanism,\nThe intercalary month completes the

deeper, hidden mystery.\nThis place, from the start, is truly magnetic—\nNaturally quenching flames and dispelling smoke.\nTo enter the Path of No-Birth,\nOne must summon the Dao—\nOnly within the heart’s field.\n\nAgain, the spring arrives, yet emptiness remains.\nToday’s handful of gentle breeze\nLets me drift like a wandering reed.\nBefore, I roamed the Cloud-Waters—\nThe Great Path stretches endlessly.\nThough my heart may grow sluggish, my body must not lag,\nFor I know the finest medicine is *Xion* [芎].\nOnce taken, my body grows light and strong—\nWith accumulated virtue and merit,\nI must ascend to the vault of Heaven.\n\n**Preface to *Lín Jiāng Xiān*** [临江仙]:\nTraveling through the capitals, prefectures, and counties,\nAnd further still to towns, villages, and streets—\nNo skill or method can bind their endless chatter.\nAll is truly the same,\nAs the six senses clamor in iron-like discord.\nDo not blame the constant echoes of pure sounds,\nNor those who call you forth from the household gate.\nPolish your heart-mirror, lest it grow dim.\nA full wheel of moonlight shines clear,\nIts light piercing through Kunlun’s heights.\nIf you govern yourself and practice without faltering,\nYour sincere heart will ascend to Heaven’s will.\nWithin, your essence is refined and radiant.\nThe numinous and true are sought with clarity—\nOnly then may you gaze upon the distant.\n\nHold fast with utmost reverence and single-minded devotion,\nIn stillness, pure and wrapped in return.\nRely upon the precepts, never straying.\nThe Nine Mysteries and Seven Ancestors,\nNow join you in ascent together.\n\nMaster the precepts, guard them with constant care,\nBestow virtue upon all—your merit is foremost.\nYour filial heart aligns with the divine.\nEnduring and self-perfected,\nForever gazing upon your ancestral ties.\nThis is the true path of cultivation,\nUnbiased and without faction.\nRelease your heart’s moon to illumine the Golden Lotus.\nFragrant incense ascends to the Azure Han,\nWorthy to offer to the Great Luo Daoists.\n\n**Again, on the Four Symbols** [四象]:\nThe nature of life and death, yin and yang—\nIf these may be discussed,\nThen the heart, spleen, kidneys, and lungs are like a surgeon’s blade.\nFurther still, the south, north, east, and west.\nThe celestial stems and branches—\nJia, Geng, Ding, and Gui,\nThe birds and beasts—Wu, Ju, Hu, and Long.\nChild and Midday harmonize, connecting Mao and You.\nSpring, winter, autumn, and summer walk hand in hand.\nWhite, green, red, and black—\nThe rainbow’s hues are revealed.\nKàn, Lí, Zhèn, and Duí—\nWater, fire, wood, and metal ascend.\n\n**Again, on the Gourd** [葫芦]:\nOne gourd, truly excellent—\nEach day it follows me.\nIts belly is bright, its core is empty.\nIt stores the elixir of jade and essence,\nA taste surpassing even curdled milk.\nDrink it daily, and it remains ever full—\nNo need for coin to buy.\nWith my staff, I lift it to the Cloud-Way.\nBefore the Three Pure Ones,\nI pass through the Millet, Pearl, and Jade.\nThe crimson canopy is raised today once more,\nAnd the pomegranate flowers bloom in time.\nWho in this gathering understands the harm of the wind?\nThe Four *Wú* [梧] know my intent,\nThe Three *Yào* [耀] dispel my misfortune.\nHaving met, do not grow intoxicated—\nWithin the cave, there’s another feast.\nA single cup avoids the wheel of rebirth.\nNaturally, clouds fill my vision—\nWith each step, I reach Penglai.\n\n**Again, a Dao-friend asks about cultivation:**\nPurify yourself, preserve your heart for great goodness,\nEver act with compassion and kindness.\nObserve the virtues of mercy and tranquility often.\nThe profound meanings of the Three Teachings,\nAll are fully realized here.\nRenouncing wife and child is the highest noble,\nAbandoning all wealth and desire is the true feast.\nNourish the five viscera to gain longevity.\nMerit fulfilled and virtue complete—\nWith a straightforward nature, you enter the Daoists’ hall.\n\nThe *Tàiyī Hùnyuán* [太一混元] true scriptures of the Dao,\nWith a clear heart and sharp essence, practice with resolve.\nFirst ensnare your own demonic corpse.\nThe Two *Xiāng* [香] lead to the upper realm,\nTheir power quietly applied.\nRescue lost souls, dissolve past karmas—\nSeeing them preserved, you gain boundless blessings.\nGhosts tremble, spirits are awestruck by the pursuit.\nThe merit is evident—\nSoon, colored clouds will follow you.»",
