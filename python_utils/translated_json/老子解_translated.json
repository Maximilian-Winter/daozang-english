  "full_translation": "The *Imperially Commissioned Complete Library of the Four Treasuries*\nSection: Masters, Volume 14\n*Explications of the Laozi*\nCategory: Daoist Works\nDescriptive Summary\n\n[We, your] ministers respectfully observe: The *Explications of the Daodejing* in two fascicles was composed by Su Zhe of the Song. Master Su’s learning originally moved between the two teachings [of Daoism and Buddhism], and thus his mastery of both was particularly profound, while his elucidations of them also sufficed to fully expound his own doctrines. This work fundamentally asserts that Buddhism and Daoism share a common source, and moreover, it draws upon the *Doctrine of the Mean* to draw parallels. Su Shi, in his postscript, remarked that had this book existed in the early Han, Confucianism and Daoism would have been unified; had it existed in the Jin and Song dynasties, Buddhism and Daoism would have been nondual. Master Zhu [Xi], however, criticized it for blending Confucianism with Mohism in his *Distinctions of Miscellaneous Learning* as a caution. Yet the texts of the two teachings often covertly appropriate Confucian principles while altering their interpretations. Those who expound the classics and clarify the Way as Confucians must not fail to distinguish the finest distinctions, dissecting points of doubt and resemblance to prevent scholars from straying onto divergent paths. If one engages in the learning of the two teachings and annotates their scriptures, one speaks for the two teachings, not for Confucianism.\n\nThe book itself does not escape the tendency to blend Confucianism with Mohism; how could its annotators not each uphold what they have heard? Thus, from the Confucian perspective, Zhe’s work straddles two paths, while from the Daoist perspective, it still elucidates a single principle. Now that the *Laozi* is preserved to represent one school of thought, Zhe’s work should not be entirely discarded either.\n\nRespectfully submitted after collation in the tenth month of the fortieth year of the Qianlong reign.\nGeneral Compilers:\nMinister Ji Yun\nMinister Lu Xixiong\nMinister Sun Shiyi\n\n**General Collators:**\nMinister Lu Feichi\n\n**Imperially Commissioned Complete Library of the Four Treasuries**\n*Laozi Explained, Volume One*\nBy Su Zhe of the Song Dynasty\n\n**Daoist Scripture**\n\n**Chapter One: \"The Dao That Can Be Spoken\"**\nThe Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao. All things are of the Dao, yet what can be spoken of the Dao cannot be constant. Only that which cannot be spoken of the Dao may endure. Consider now benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom—these are the Dao that can be spoken. Yet benevolence cannot become righteousness, nor can propriety become wisdom. That which can be spoken of the Dao cannot be constant. Only the unspoken may abide in benevolence as benevolence, in righteousness as righteousness, and so too with propriety and wisdom. These are all inconstant, while the Dao remains unchanging. Thus does the unspeakable endure.\n\n**Chapter Two: \"The Name That Can Be Named\"**\nIf the Dao cannot be spoken, how much less can it be named? All names belong to that which can be spoken. Once a name is established, the distinctions of round and square, crooked and straight, cannot endure. \"Nameless, it is the beginning of Heaven and Earth; named, it is the mother of the myriad things.\" Thus, constantly desireless, one observes its mystery; constantly desiring, one observes its manifestations. From the nameless, form arises to become Heaven and Earth. Once Heaven and Earth are established, names begin. From the named, the myriad things proliferate. Once the myriad things flourish, names cannot be exhaustively recorded. Therefore, the nameless is the essence of the Dao, and the named is its function. The sage embodies the Dao to serve the world, entering into the realm of multiplicity while abiding in the constant void, thereby observing its mystery. Embodying the utmost emptiness while abiding in the constant presence, one observes its manifestations. Yet if one acts upon manifestations without knowing the mystery, one is coarse and lacks spirit. If one lingers in the mystery without knowing its manifestations, one is refined but unchanging.\n\nThese two emerge from the same source yet bear different names; together they are called the Profound. In terms of form, there are indeed the two—being and non-being. How can one know that non-being transforms into being, and being reverts to non-being, without ever ceasing to be one? Though their names differ, their root is the same. To know the unity of the root is to be profound. All things distant and boundless in their extremity are inevitably profound in appearance. Thus does Laozi often employ \"profound\" to signify the ultimate. Profound beyond the profound is the gateway to all mysteries. To speak of the profound is to reach the limit, yet the mind still clings to profundity. Profound beyond the profound is the utmost, beyond which nothing can be added. It is the source from which all mysteries emerge.\n\n**Chapter Two: \"When All the World Knows\"**\nWhen all the world knows beauty as beauty, ugliness arises. When all know goodness as goodness, un-goodness arises. Thus, being and non-being give rise to one another; difficulty and ease complete one another; long and short shape one another; high and low incline toward one another; sound and voice harmonize with one another; before and after follow one another. The world speaks of beauty and ugliness in terms of form and name. What it calls beautiful and good—are these truly beautiful and good? It does not know that being and non-being, difficulty and ease, high and low, sound and voice, before and after, give rise to and supplant one another, none of which is constant. One may consider oneself long, yet upon encountering one longer, one becomes short. One may consider oneself ahead, yet upon being preceded by another, one falls behind. If one follows what is deemed beautiful and trusts in it, one strays far indeed.\n\nThus the sage engages in non-action and practices the teaching without words. When acting, the mind abides in non-action; when teaching, the intent lies in wordlessness. Thus one transcends the measures of long and short, departs from the calculations of before and after, neither beautiful nor ugly, neither good nor un-good. How then can the world comprehend it? The myriad things arise, yet one does not refuse them; they are born, yet one does not possess them; one acts, yet does not rely on them; accomplishments are achieved, yet one does not dwell in them. The myriad things act for me, yet I do not refuse them. I act for their sake, yet do not possess them, do not rely on them. When success is achieved, I do not dwell in it. This is the reward of non-action and wordlessness. The sage does not even know what is beautiful and good—how then could ugliness and un-goodness follow?\n\nOnly by not dwelling does one not depart. The sage dwells in poverty and lowliness without the sorrow of poverty and lowliness; dwells in wealth and nobility without the burdens of wealth and nobility. This is what is meant by \"not dwelling.\" If I do not dwell, how can it depart? This is the utmost of dwelling.\n\n**Chapter Three: \"Not Exalting the Worthy\"**\nNot exalting the worthy prevents the people from contending. Not prizing rare goods prevents the people from stealing. Not displaying what is desirable prevents the heart from being disordered. Thus the sage’s governance empties the heart, fills the belly, weakens the will, and strengthens the bones. Exalting the worthy causes the people to feel shame in their inferiority and leads to contention. Prizing rare goods causes the people to suffer from lack and leads to theft. Displaying what is desirable causes the people to worry over not obtaining it and leads to disorder. Though the world knows these three as sources of trouble and wishes to abolish them, it is deluded.\n\nThe sage acts otherwise. He does not fail to employ the worthy—he simply does not exalt them. He does not discard rare goods—he simply does not prize them. He does not eliminate desire—he simply does not display it.\n\nThus, when the worthy are employed yet the people do not contend, when rare goods and desirable things are all displayed yet theft, calamity, and disorder do not arise—is this not to empty the heart without harming the fullness of the belly, to weaken the will without harming the strength of the bones?\n\nNow, if one were to exalt the worthy and prize rare goods, displaying what is desirable, then both heart and belly would be filled. If one were to abolish and discard them, then both will and bones would be weakened. When heart and belly are both filled, the people contend; when will and bones are both weak, they have nothing with which to stand.\n\nConstantly cause the people to be without knowledge and without desire, so that those with knowledge dare not act. Do not display these three, and the people will have nothing to admire—calm and without desire, even the wise will have no use for their cunning. Act through non-action, and nothing will be left ungoverned. Follow the natural course of these three without exalting, prizing, or displaying—this is what is called \"acting through non-action.\"\n\n**Chapter Four: The Dao’s Profound Emptiness**\nThe Dao is empty, yet its use is inexhaustible.\nProfound! It seems the ancestor of the myriad things.\nIt blunts their sharpness, unties their tangles,\nharmonizes their light, and merges with their dust.\nDeep and still, it seems ever-present.\nI do not know whose child it is—\nit resembles the ancestor of the gods.\n\nThough the Dao is ever-present, it ultimately cannot be named, yet it cannot be said to be nonexistent. Thus it is said: \"This must precede even the gods.\" If it precedes the gods and is yet prior to them, then nothing precedes it.\n\n**Chapter Five: Heaven and Earth Are Not Benevolent**\nHeaven and earth are not benevolent—\nthey treat the myriad things as straw dogs.\nThe sage is not benevolent—\nhe treats the hundred clans as straw dogs.\nHeaven and earth are impartial, allowing the myriad things to follow their nature.\nThus, things live and die of themselves—\ndeath is not their cruelty, nor life their benevolence.\nIt is like binding straw to make dogs for sacrifice,\nadorning them for the rites—\nwas this done out of love?\nAfter the rites, they are discarded,\ntrampled by passersby—\nwas this done out of hatred?\nIt is simply as it is.\nThe sage’s relation to the people is the same:\nif he does nothing to harm them, the people preserve their nature.\nThough death and life proceed without his intervention,\nhis non-benevolence is itself great benevolence.\n\nThe space between heaven and earth—\nis it not like a bellows?\nEmpty yet inexhaustible,\nthe more it moves, the more it yields.\nTo push it is to have bellows and pipes—\nwith a single motion, the qi reaches everywhere.\nThe ignorant think it the height of ingenuity,\nyet what does the bellows itself do?\nIt is simply empty and inexhaustible,\nthus the more it moves, the more it yields.\nThe beginning of the transformation of the myriad things,\nthe carving of all forms between heaven and earth—\nis it not like this?\n\nMuch speech leads to exhaustion—\nbetter to guard the center.\n\n**Chapter Six: The Valley Spirit Does Not Die**\nThe valley spirit does not die—\nthis is called the mysterious female.\nThe valley is utterly empty yet has form;\nthe valley spirit is empty and without form.\nEmpty and without form, it has no life—\nhow could it have death?\nIt is called the valley spirit to speak of its power,\nthe mysterious female to speak of its function.\nThe female gives birth to the myriad things—\nit is called \"mysterious\" because one sees it give birth\nbut does not see how it gives birth.\n\nThe gate of the mysterious female—\nthis is called the root of heaven and earth.\nThe gate of the mysterious female:\nthe myriad things emerge from it.\nThe root of heaven and earth:\nheaven and earth arise from it.\nContinuous, as if existing,\nits use is never exhausted.\n\n**Chapter Seven: Heaven and Earth Are Everlasting**\nHeaven is everlasting, earth enduring.\nHeaven and earth, though vast, have not escaped form and number—\ntheir longevity is thus limited.\nYet Laozi speaks of them as everlasting,\nfor he refers only to what humans perceive.\nAs for true everlastingness—\nit is what is called \"the beginning of heaven and earth.\"\n\nHeaven and earth endure because they do not live for themselves—\nthus they achieve long life.\nTherefore the sage places himself last and finds himself first,\nsets himself aside and finds himself preserved.\nIs it not because he is selfless\nthat he achieves his own ends?\n\nHeaven and earth give life to things yet do not claim life for themselves,\nstanding beyond the myriad things—thus they endure.\nThe sage places himself after others yet is foremost,\nsets himself apart yet benefits others,\nstanding beyond the crowd—thus he is first and preserved.\nIf heaven and earth competed with things for life,\nif the sage contended with people for gain,\nthen heaven and earth would be but one thing among many,\nthe sage but one person among others—\nhow could they surpass them?\nThough their selflessness is not a means to achieve private ends,\nprivate ends are thereby achieved—\nthis is the natural course of the Dao.\n\n**Chapter Eight: The Highest Good Is Like Water**\nThe highest good is like water.\nWater benefits the myriad things without contending,\ndwelling in places the multitudes despise—\nthus it is close to the Dao.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* says: \"The alternation of yin and yang is called the Dao.\nWhat continues it is good; what completes it is nature.\"\nIt also says: \"Heaven uses the One to give birth to water.\"\nThe Dao moves and becomes good, just as qi moves and gives birth to water.\nThus it is said: \"The highest good is like water.\"\nBoth begin from nothing and take form—\ntheir principles are the same.\nThe Dao is present everywhere, benefiting all without exception—\nand water is the same.\nYet once bound to form, it differs from the Dao.\nThus it is said: \"close to the Dao.\"\nYet it can be named good—\nnothing surpasses it.\nThus it is called \"the highest good.\"\n\nDwelling in good earth,\nthe heart in good depth,\ngiving with good benevolence,\nspeaking with good sincerity,\ngoverning with good order,\nhandling affairs with good ability,\nacting with good timing—\navoiding the high, flowing to the low,\nnever opposing—this is good earth.\nEmpty, still, and unfathomably deep—this is good depth.\nBenefiting and nourishing the myriad things,\ngiving without seeking repayment—this is good benevolence.\nRound it turns, square it bends,\nblocked it stops, unblocked it flows—this is good sincerity.\nWashing away all filth, leveling high and low—this is good order.\nMeeting things and giving them form without clinging to one—this is good ability.\nFreezing in winter, melting in spring,\ndrying and flooding without losing measure—this is good timing.\n\nThe non-contending thus knows no blame.\nTo have virtue yet not escape human censure is due to contention.\nWater, by not contending, embodies the seven virtues without blame.\n\n**Chapter Nine: Holding and Filling**\n\nHolding and filling—better to cease.\nHoning to a point—cannot long endure.\nKnowing that fullness must overflow yet insisting on holding fast—\nnot as secure as remaining unfilled.\nKnowing that sharpness must break yet striving to hone it first—\none cannot rely on such honing.\nThus the sage possesses yet does not possess—\nhow then could there be fullness?\nFollowing principle before acting—\nhow then could there be sharpness?\nWithout fullness, there is no need to hold.\nWithout sharpness, there is no need to hone.\n\nGold and jade fill the hall—none can guard them.\nWealth and nobility breed arrogance—self-invited calamity.\nSuccess achieved, fame attained—withdraw the self.\nThis is the Dao of Heaven.\nThe sun at its zenith must decline,\nthe moon at its full must wane,\nthe turning of the four seasons—\nthose who achieve must depart.\nHeaven and Earth still abide—\nhow much more so for man?\n\n**Chapter Ten: Carrying Spirit and Soul**\n\nCarrying spirit and soul, embracing the One—\ncan they not be separated?\nWhat distinguishes *po* from *hun*?\n*Po* belongs to the physical, *hun* to the spiritual.\nThe *Yi* says: \"Essence and qi form things; wandering *hun* brings change.\"\nThus we know the nature of spirit and soul:\n*Po* is physical, thus mixed and at rest;\n*hun* is spiritual, thus unified and transforming.\nThis is called \"carrying spirit and soul\"—speaking of their rest.\n\nThe Dao pervades all things;\nin man, it is called *xing* (nature),\nand the marvel of *xing* is spirit.\nSpeaking of its purity before admixture—it is called \"the One.\"\nSpeaking of its gathering before dispersal—it is called \"the uncarved block.\"\nAll return to the Dao, each named according to its reality.\n\nThe sage’s nature is settled, spirit congealed—\nunmoved by external things.\nThough *po* serves as its dwelling,\nwherever spirit desires to go, *po* follows without fail—\nthus spirit ever carries *po*.\nThe common man is enslaved by things, spirit obscured and disordered—\nthus spirit submits to *po*.\nEyes and ears are wearied by sounds and sights,\nnose and mouth labor over scents and flavors.\nWherever *po* desires to go, spirit follows—\nthus *po* ever carries spirit.\n\nTherefore, the teaching is to embrace spirit and carry *po*,\nso the two do not separate.\nThis is indeed the sage’s essential method of cultivating the self.\nAs for the ancients’ \"true persons,\"\nwith deep roots and firm stems,\nlong life and enduring vision—\ntheir Dao likewise arises from this.\n\n**Concentrating qi to attain suppleness—can one be like an infant?**\nWhen spirit is disordered, qi scatters:\nthe strong become belligerent,\nthe weak become fearful—\nunaware of themselves.\nWhen spirit is ordered, qi does not act recklessly;\njoy and anger each follow their proper measure—\nthis is called \"concentrating qi.\"\nThe utmost emptiness of spirit,\nthe beginning of qi’s fullness.\nEmptiness at its extreme is suppleness;\nfullness at its extreme is hardness.\nPure nature without qi—\nthis is called \"attaining suppleness.\"\nThe infant knows neither good nor evil—\nthus its nature is whole.\nNature whole, qi is guarded;\nqi guarded, the body is supple.\nConcentrating qi to attain suppleness—\nthe infant is the utmost.\n\n**Purifying the profound mirror—can one be without flaw?**\nThe sage, externally not carried by *po*,\ninternally not driven by qi—\nthus purifies away all dust and grime.\nThereupon, their spirit is vast and profoundly mirrors all things,\nknowing all arise from nature,\nviewing purity and filth equally—\nwithout blemish.\n\n**Loving the people and governing the state—can one act without contrivance?**\nHaving cultivated the self, one extends the surplus to others.\nThough governing the state and loving the people,\none meets them with a mindless heart.\nIf one acts with intention,\nthen loving the people only harms them,\ngoverning the state only brings disorder.\n\n**The gate of Heaven opens and closes—can one act as the female?**\nThe gate of Heaven is where order and chaos, rise and fall emerge.\nHaving taken the world upon oneself,\namidst its opening and closing, its changing encounters—\nthe common man values gain and fears loss,\nthus rushes ahead to seek fortune.\nThe sage follows principle and knows Heaven’s mandate,\nwaiting for the call before responding.\nThe *Yi* says: \"Preceding Heaven, Heaven does not oppose;\nfollowing Heaven, one accords with the time.\"\nThis is not truly preceding or following—\nrather, one’s before and after always meet Heaven’s mandate.\nOtherwise, the early will be premature, the late will be delayed—\nboth miss the mark.\nThus, \"acting as the female\" means nothing more than not missing the time.\n\n**Understanding the four directions—can one be without knowledge?**\nInternally cultivating the self, externally governing the state—\nfacing change, there is always a Dao.\nIs this not \"understanding the four directions\"?\n\"Understanding the four directions\" is the mind.\nYet this mind knows nothing without ever possessing a knowing mind.\nThe mind is one—\nif there were another that knows,\nthen it would be two.\nFrom one to two—\nthis is the origin of delusion,\nthe beginning of folly.\nNow, the mirror’s response to things—\nonce they come, it reflects them.\nHow could it know the one reflecting?\nOriginally, there is nothing—\nto impose intention upon it is the source of delusion.\n\n**Giving life and nurturing—**\ngiving life yet not possessing,\nacting yet not relying,\ngrowing yet not ruling—\nthis is called \"profound virtue.\"\nIts Dao suffices to give life and nurture the myriad things,\nyet can be without possession, without reliance, without ruling.\nThough possessing great virtue, things do not know it—\nthus it is called \"profound virtue.\"\n\n**Chapter Eleven: The Thirty Spokes**\n\nThirty spokes share one hub—\nwhere there is nothing, lies the use of the cart.\nClay is shaped into vessels—\nwhere there is nothing, lies the use of the vessel.\nDoors and windows are cut to make a room—\nwhere there is nothing, lies the use of the room.\nThus, having gives advantage;\nnothingness gives use.\n\nExhausting wisdom and resources to make tools—\nthe use of tools always lies in nothingness.\nWithout having, nothingness cannot achieve its use;\nwithout nothingness, having cannot apply its advantage.\nThus the sage constantly observes the wondrous in nothingness,\nconstantly observes the subtleties in having.\nKnowing the two as one and indivisible—\nthis is the utmost.\n\n**Chapter Twelve: The Five Colors**\n\nThe five colors blind the eyes.\nThe five tones deafen the ears.\nThe five flavors dull the palate.\nRacing and hunting madden the heart.\nRare goods impede conduct.\nThus the sage is for the belly, not for the eyes—\nhence rejecting that and choosing this.\n\nThe sage sees colors, hears sounds, tastes flavors—\nall the same as others.\nAs for racing and hunting, they have never not engaged in them;\nas for rare goods, they have never not used them.\nYet all consider these harmful, while the sage alone deems them fortunate.\nWhy?\nThe sage is for the belly, the common man for the eyes.\nThe eyes covet yet cannot receive;\nthe belly receives yet never covets.\nThat which comes from without—\nthis is the external thing.\nThat which congeals within—\nthis is the nature’s essence.\n\n**Chapter Thirteen: Favor and Disgrace**\n\nFavor and disgrace are like alarm; value great affliction as you value the body.\nThe perspicacious of old were alarmed by favor as by disgrace, knowing that favor is but the precursor of disgrace.\nThey valued the body as they valued great affliction, knowing that the body is the root of affliction.\nThus, by relinquishing favor, disgrace could not reach them; by forgetting the body, affliction could not arise.\n\nWhat is meant by \"favor and disgrace are like alarm\"?\nFavor is inferior: gaining it is like alarm, losing it is like alarm—this is what is called \"favor and disgrace are like alarm.\"\nYet favor and disgrace are not two things: disgrace arises from favor, though the world does not perceive this, taking favor as superior and disgrace as inferior.\nIf one knows that disgrace arises from favor, then favor is inherently inferior.\nThus, the perspicacious of old, upon gaining favor, were alarmed; upon losing favor, were alarmed—never complacent in favor, ever wary of disgrace.\nThis \"like alarm\" is not true alarm, but merely akin to it.\n\nWhat is meant by \"value great affliction as you value the body\"?\nThe reason I have great affliction is that I have a body; if I had no body, what affliction would I have?\n\"Value\" here means \"to find difficult.\"\nThe body is the root of great affliction, yet the world’s scholars find it difficult to endure affliction but not difficult to possess a body.\nThus, the sage, recognizing their difficulty in enduring affliction, teaches them the difficulty of possessing a body.\nKnowing the difficulty of possessing a body, great affliction departs.\nHuman nature, from birth, cannot be augmented by life nor diminished by death; its greatness can fill heaven and earth, its essence can tread water and fire, enter metal and jade—no thing can afflict it.\nYet the world constantly fears the loss of its original nature, seeing only the body as beloved.\nWhen attachment to the body is deep, things begin to afflict it.\nThe changes of life and death, sickness and infirmity, attack from within; the encounters of favor and disgrace, gain and loss, assail from without—there is not a single thing that is not affliction.\nOnly the perspicacious, knowing that nature is indestructible while the body is insubstantial, suddenly forget the body, and all afflictions of the world vanish.\nOnly then can one traverse the world without encumbrance.\n\nThus, one who values the body for the sake of the world may be entrusted with the world; one who cherishes the body for the sake of the world may be relied upon with the world.\nPeople pursue power and profit, drown in wealth and nobility, brave hardship without regret—all to enrich their bodies.\nNow, if one is endowed with the world yet takes the body as weighty, their forgetting of the body is complete.\nEntrusting the world to such a one, even the vastness of the world cannot afflict them.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Fourteen: The Unseen**\n\nLook at it and it cannot be seen—this is called *yi*.\nListen to it and it cannot be heard—this is called *xi*.\nGrasp it and it cannot be held—this is called *wei*.\nThese three cannot be exhaustively questioned, thus they merge into one.\n\nWhat can be seen is form; what enables seeing form cannot itself be seen.\nWhat can be heard is sound; what enables hearing sound cannot itself be heard.\nWhat can be grasped is touch; what enables grasping touch cannot itself be grasped.\nThough the wise cannot question these three, they must ultimately merge and return to the one.\nThis \"one\" is nature; the three are the functions of nature.\nHumans begin with nature alone, but upon engaging with things, it splits and scatters into seeing, hearing, and touching, used daily yet unrecognized.\nNot returning to the root, no longer merging into one, they grow ever more distant.\nIf one extends this principle, it is what the Buddhists call the six senses—all are thus.\nThe *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* states: \"Reversing the flow, wholly one, the six functions cease\"—this is the meaning.\n\nAbove, it is not bright; below, it is not dark.\nThings with form all cling to yin and yang, thus above is bright and below is dark—inescapable.\nYet the Dao, though above, is not bright; though below, is not dark—difficult to infer through form or measure.\n\nEndlessly it flows, nameless—returning to nothingness.\nEndlessly it moves without cease. People see its ceaseless movement and assume it is something, unaware that it ultimately returns to nothing. This is called \"the form of the formless, the image of the imageless\"—what is termed *huhuang*. When it manifests, it takes form; when it guards, it takes image. The form of the formless, the image of the imageless—these are not nothing, yet being and nothingness cannot be named, hence it is called *huhuang*.\n\nMeet it and you do not see its beginning; follow it and you do not see its end.\nThe Dao is everywhere, thus no before or after can be seen.\n\nHold to the ancient Dao to master today’s being.\nTo know the ancient beginning is called the discipline of the Dao. The ancient is the source from which things arise; the present is the current state of things, while the ancient is their origin. Grasping their source, advance and retreat, speed and slowness lie within my control.\n\n**Chapter Fifteen: The Skill of the Ancients**\nThe skillful masters of old were subtle, profound, and penetrating—too deep to be known.\nThey exhausted the coarse and guarded the subtle, reaching the utmost subtlety. Subtlety perfected, they became all-pervading and profoundly unknowable.\n\nOnly because they could not be known were they forced to describe their bearing:\nHesitant, as if crossing a river in winter;\nCautious, as if wary of neighbors on all sides;\nReserved, as if a guest;\nYielding, like ice about to melt;\nSimple, like uncarved wood;\nVast, like a valley;\nTurbid, like muddy water.\n\nWho can still the turbid to gradually clarify it?\nWho can remain at rest to gradually bring forth life?\nThose of the world who drown their nature in things grow turbid and never clear; those who desiccate their nature through stillness grow inert and never live. But knowing that turbidity disturbs nature, one stills it—stilled, it slowly clears. Knowing that extinguishing nature is not the Way, one moves—moved, it slowly lives. As the *Yi* says: \"Still and unmoving, yet responsive, it penetrates all things under heaven.\" What is called \"movement\" here is of the same kind.\n\nThose who preserve this Dao do not desire fullness.\nFullness arises from extremity, leading to turbidity that cannot clear and stillness that cannot live—hence fullness.\nOnly by not being full can one remain worn yet not newly made.\nNo thing does not wear out; only by not being full does its weariness depart without needing renewal.\n\n**Chapter Sixteen: Attaining the Utmost Void**\nAttain the utmost void; guard steadfast stillness.\nIf the void is not utterly attained, something remains; if stillness is not steadfastly guarded, movement lingers. Though mountains and hills are removed, motes of dust remain—this is not the utmost or the steadfast. To attain the void is still to dwell in being; to guard stillness is still to be bound by movement—how much more so for other things? Without the utmost or the steadfast, demanding the function of void and stillness is difficult.\n\nAll things arise together; I observe their return.\nOnly by attaining the utmost void and steadfast stillness can one observe the transformations of the ten thousand things without being disturbed by change, knowing that all arising must return. If I were to arise together with the ten thousand things, I would not be able to know this.\n\nThe ten thousand things flourish, each returning to its root.\nAll things arise from nature and return to nature—like blossoms and leaves growing from the root and returning to it, or waves rising from water and returning to it.\n\nReturning to the root is called stillness.\nIf one cannot naturally return to nature, merely stopping movement and stilling thoughts to seek stillness is not true stillness. Only by returning to the root is there stillness.\n\nThis is called returning to life.\nLife is the mystery of nature. Nature can be spoken of, but when it comes to life, it cannot be spoken.\n\nThe *Yi* says: \"Exhausting principle, fulfilling nature, one reaches life.\" The sage’s study of the Dao must begin with exhausting principle, proceed to fulfilling nature, and culminate in returning to life. Benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and music are how the sage engages with things, yet the function of benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and music must have a source. Those who act without knowing their source are common people; those who know their source and then act are noble ones. This is called exhausting principle. However, one must exert the heart to exhaust principle before attaining it—without seeking, it is not obtained. When things daily confront one, only by seeking can one respond, but this requires effort, and its achievement is slight. Apart from sages, those not obscured by things preserve their nature, which is serene, effortlessly centered, unthinking yet attaining, responsive to things as they come—this is called fulfilling nature. Yet this is still my nature, and as long as there is a distinction between self and things, it verges on delusion.\n\nThe ruler’s decree is called life; Heaven’s decree is called life.\nEngaging with things through nature without knowing it is oneself is why it is entrusted to life.\n\nThis is called returning to life.\nReturning to life is called constancy.\nWhen things arise, even the vastness of heaven and earth, mountains and rivers, is subject to change and impermanence. Only by returning to nature does one abide in serene constancy.\n\nKnowing constancy is called illumination.\nNot taking the return to nature as illumination is merely worldly wisdom—though one may call it illumination, it is not true illumination.\n\nNot knowing constancy, reckless action brings misfortune.\nNot knowing the return to nature, one moves with things—no action is not misfortune. Though one may gain for a moment, the loss is profound.\n\nKnowing constancy, one is capacious.\nWhen deluded by delusion, one is self-righteous and sees others as wrong—all things become enemies. How can one be capacious? But knowing all is delusion, even enemies are met with compassion and pity—what cannot be accommodated?\n\nCapacious, thus impartial.\nWithout exception, all is accommodated, and the feelings of self and others are exhausted—whom would one favor?\n\nImpartial, thus kingly.\nWithout exception, all is impartial—then the world will come and submit.\n\nKingly, thus Heaven.\nWithout exception, all is embraced—what can Heaven add?\n\nHeaven, thus Dao.\nHeaven still has form; the Dao is the utmost. Yet even the Dao cannot advance beyond this.\n\nDao, thus enduring; the body does not perish.\n**Chapter Seventeen: The Highest**\nThe highest ruler—those below know only of his existence.\nGoverning the world through the Dao without ever ruling, the people do not know why things are so—they merely acknowledge his existence.\n\nNext, they draw near and praise him.\nGoverning the world through benevolence and righteousness, his virtue is cherished and his achievements visible, so the people draw near and praise him. Though his name is fine, the distinction between greater and lesser begins here.\n\nNext, they fear him; next, they scorn him.\nGoverning the people through policies, they cannot but fear—yet where power does not reach, they scorn him.\nThus, when trust is insufficient, there is distrust.\nIf I truly trust myself, governing the world through the Dao suffices.\nOnly when lacking self-trust does one resort to benevolence and righteousness, then weigh them with punishments and policies—thus the people begin to distrust.\nHow solemnly he values his words!\nWhen his work is accomplished and affairs settled, the hundred clans all say, \"We are so of ourselves.\"\nThe sage, with self-trust to spare, in his speech still values them, not lightly uttering them from his mouth—thus the people trust him.\nWhen his work is accomplished and affairs settled, the people daily turn toward goodness and distance themselves from transgression, yet do not know it.\n\n**Chapter Eighteen: The Great Dao**\nWhen the great Dao declines, there is benevolence and righteousness.\nWhen the great Dao flourishes, benevolence and righteousness operate within it, yet the people do not know.\nOnly when the great Dao declines do benevolence and righteousness appear.\nWhen wisdom and intelligence emerge, there is great falsity.\nThe world does not know that the Dao suffices to govern the myriad things, yet imposes wisdom and intelligence—thus the people begin to repay with falsity.\nWhen the six relations are disharmonious, there are filial piety and compassion.\nWhen the state is in chaos, there are loyal ministers.\nWhen the six relations are harmonious, who is not filial and compassionate?\nWhen the state is well-ordered, who is not loyal?\nYao was not unfilial, yet only Shun is praised—for he had no blind father.\nYi Yin and the Duke of Zhou were not disloyal, yet only Longfeng and Bigan are praised—for there were no Jie and Zhou.\nFish trapped in a dried-up marsh exhale moisture upon one another, moisten one another with dampness—better to forget one another in rivers and lakes.\n\n**Chapter Nineteen: Abandoning Sagacity and Discarding Wisdom**\nAbandon sagacity, discard wisdom, and the people benefit a hundredfold.\n\nNot that sagacity and wisdom are insufficient to grasp the Dao—had sagacity and wisdom governed the world, would there be any who did not □□ things? Yet the people of the age, unable to comprehend the root of sagacity and wisdom, perceive only their branches and take them for skill in overcoming things. Thus they gallop along the branch-streams, and the people begin to suffer harm beyond measure. Therefore, abandon sagacity, discard wisdom, and the people benefit a hundredfold.\n\nAbandon benevolence, discard righteousness, and the people return to filial piety and compassion. Never has there been one who practiced benevolence yet neglected their kin; never has there been one who upheld righteousness yet failed their lord. Benevolence and righteousness are the means by which filial piety and loyalty are realized. Yet when they decline, people usurp the names of benevolence and righteousness to seek profit in the world. Thus sons defy fathers, and fathers abuse sons—this is the work of the traces of benevolence and righteousness. Therefore, abandon benevolence, discard righteousness, and the people return to filial piety and compassion.\n\nAbandon skill, discard profit, and there are no thieves or bandits. Skill is for facilitating tasks; profit is for aiding things. Neither is intended for theft, yet without them, thieves and bandits cannot act. Therefore, abandon skill, discard profit, and there are no thieves or bandits.\n\nThese three are considered cultural refinements, yet they are insufficient—thus they must be assigned to something. Manifest plainness, embrace simplicity, reduce selfishness, diminish desires. The world values these three as remedies for disorder, believing that cultural refinement is insufficient. Some attribute them to sagacity and wisdom, others to benevolence and righteousness, still others to skill and profit—all in an attempt to govern through refinement. Yet the world grows ever more disordered. Why not return to the root?\n\nManifest plainness, embrace simplicity, reduce selfishness, diminish desires, and the world each returns to its nature. Though these three exist, they have no use. Therefore it is said: I practice non-action, and the people transform themselves; I cherish stillness, and the people rectify themselves; I engage in no affairs, and the people enrich themselves; I have no desires, and the people return to simplicity. This is the ultimate of sagacity and wisdom, the perfection of benevolence and righteousness, the pinnacle of skill and profit.\n\nYet Confucius governed the world with benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and music, while Laozi abandoned and discarded them. Some deem their approaches different. The *Yi* says: \"That which is above form is called the Dao; that which is below form is called the instrument.\" Confucius, foreseeing the troubles of later ages, took deep concern. Thus he showed people the instruments while obscuring the Dao, allowing those below the middle to uphold the instruments without being misled by the Dao, thereby avoiding failure in becoming noble persons. Those above the middle, by this means, could ascend to higher understanding.\n\nLaozi acted otherwise. His aim was to clarify the Dao. The Dao cannot be spoken; whatever can be spoken is but its semblance. The enlightened use the false to recognize the true, while the benighted cling to semblances and fall into grave error. Thus in later ages, some have seized upon Laozi’s words to bring chaos to the world, while those who study Confucius commit no great errors. Many have used Laozi’s words to attain the Dao, while those who seek it in Confucius often struggle to find an entry point. The two sages acted out of necessity. Perfection in one aspect inevitably entails neglect in another.\n\n**Chapter Twenty: Abandoning Learning Brings No Sorrow**\n\n**Chapter Twenty: Abandoning Learning Brings No Sorrow**\n\nTo abandon learning is to be without sorrow. Pursuing learning leads to daily accumulation; cultivating the Dao leads to daily reduction. Not knowing the true nature of life and destiny, one seeks to augment through learning, heaping up what one has not yet heard, accumulating without end. Yet without a unifying principle, the round harms the square, the straight harms the curved, and the mind becomes entangled, unable to bear its sorrows. This is the calamity that befalls the learner. Thus it is said: abandon learning, and there is no sorrow.\n\nAs for the sage, though he has never ceased to learn, he takes the Dao as his master. He does not learn and yet lacks nothing; he learns much and yet is not confused. Vast and unburdened, he is without sorrow—why would he need to abandon learning?\n\nBetween \"aye\" and \"nay,\" how great is the distance? Between good and evil, how vast is the difference? When the learner is drowned in what he has heard and lacks a unifying principle, then \"aye\" becomes reverence and \"nay\" becomes contempt—these cannot be spoken of in the same breath. How much more so the opposition between good and evil? Only the sage knows that the myriad things all emerge from the same nature yet are completed in delusion. Like painting horses and oxen, like carving tigers and swine, none are their true forms. When all distinctions of right and wrong, same and different vanish, who can say how great the distance between them truly is? If this is so, then the myriad things grow together without harming one another, and the Dao flows in parallel without conflict—nothing is strange in this.\n\nWhat people fear, one cannot but fear.\n\nThe sage equalizes self and other, unifies same and different, and his mind leaves no residue. Yet how could this mean he neglects the world’s laws, violates social roles, or disrupts principle? What people fear, I too fear; what people do, I too do. Though I stand among the ranks of ruler and minister, father and child, and move within the domains of ritual, music, punishment, and governance, the world does not perceive me as different. What keeps me from being ensnared by things is nothing but the mind.\n\nVast and boundless, it has no end.\n\nPeople all follow what they know, rigidly confined within their narrow paths. The sage traverses both being and non-being, entering all without obstruction—vast and boundless, it cannot be exhausted.\n\nThe multitude bustles and rejoices, as if feasting on a grand sacrifice, as if ascending the terrace in spring. I alone remain still, without sign, like an infant who has not yet learned to smile. People are each drowned in their own preferences, delighting in their pleasures as if feasting on a grand sacrifice, as if ascending the terrace in spring, clamoring to follow them without knowing their error. Only the sage deeply investigates delusion and meets it with stillness, unmoved, like an infant who has not yet learned to smile.\n\nAdrift, as if with no place to return.\n\nRiding the principle of the myriad things without self-interest, he seems to have no place to return.\n\nThe multitude all have more than enough; I alone seem lacking.\n\nThe multitude cling to what they know, each considering themselves full. The sage embraces the myriad things without being bound to one, transcending as if lacking.\n\nIs my mind that of a fool? So muddled!\n\nMuddled as if foolish, yet not foolish.\n\nThe common people are bright; I alone seem dim. The common people are sharp; I alone seem dull.\n\nThe world takes discrimination as wisdom. The sage knows that the delusions of the multitude are not worth distinguishing, so outwardly he seems dim, inwardly he seems dull.\n\nVast like the sea, drifting as if without place to rest.\n\nSuddenly like the sea, its shores unseen, drifting without fixed abode, its resting place unknown.\n\nThe multitude all have their uses; I alone seem stubborn and coarse.\n\nEach has their abilities, so the world can employ them all. The sage’s talents are complete and virtue perfect, as if he has nothing to offer—hence he is suspected of stubbornness and coarseness.\n\nI alone differ from others and value drawing sustenance from the Mother.\n\nThe Dao is the Mother of the myriad things. The multitude pursue things and forget the Dao, while the sage leaves the myriad things behind and takes the Dao as his foundation. Like an infant with no mixed diet, he draws sustenance from the Mother alone.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-One: The Manifestation of Great Virtue**\n\nThe manifestation of great virtue follows only the Dao.\n\nThe Dao is formless. When it moves and becomes virtue, it takes form. Thus virtue is the manifestation of the Dao. Extending this, the forms of all things are the Dao’s manifestation in them.\n\nAs for the Dao as a thing, it is only vague and indistinct. Indistinct, yet within it there are images; vague, yet within it there are things.\n\nThe Dao is neither being nor non-being, so it is described as vague and indistinct. Yet when it reaches its full movement, images take shape and things become manifest—nothing does not emerge from this vagueness and indistinctness.\n\nDark and deep, within it there is essence.\n\nWhen being and non-being are not yet determined, it is vague and indistinct, invisible. At the intersection of being and non-being, its depth and subtlety become apparent. Though form has not yet taken shape, essence resides within it.\n\nIts essence is utterly real; within it there is sincerity.\n\nWhen things take form, truth and falsehood become mixed. But when essence is present, falsehood has no place. Once truth and falsehood are mixed, they divide from one into two, from two into three, branching out in confusion, no longer trustworthy. But when essence is present, it does not deceive me.\n\nFrom ancient times to the present, its name has not departed, by which it surveys the origins of the multitude.\n\nThough ancient and present differ, the Dao does not depart—hence it is named \"not departing.\" Only because it has never departed can it survey the changes of the myriad things. *Fu* means beauty, yet even the beauty of the myriad things cannot escape change.\n\nHow do I know the nature of the origins of the multitude? By this.\n\nThe sage’s knowledge of why the myriad things are as they are comes from embodying the Dao without departing from it.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Two: Yielding Brings Wholeness**\n\nYielding brings wholeness.\n\nThe sage’s every movement follows principle. Where principle lies, whether straight or curved, the essential thing is to achieve passage. Achieving passage, he does not conflict with things; not conflicting, he remains whole.\n\nBending brings straightness.\n\nStraightness that does not follow principle is not true straightness. Following principle, though it may bend, is the ultimate straightness under heaven.\n\nHollow brings fullness.\n\nWhat the multitude gather toward is low. Even if one does not wish to be full, it cannot be avoided.\n\nWorn brings renewal.\n\nBrightness and sharpness are not the Dao. Dullness, as if worn, is the source of daily renewal.\n\nLittle brings attainment.\n\nThe Dao is one alone. Attaining the one, there is nothing unattained.\n\nMuch brings confusion.\n\nMuch learning without a unifying principle brings confusion.\n\nTherefore, the sage embraces the one and becomes the model for the world.\n\nEmbracing the one means returning to one’s nature. For yielding brings wholeness, bending brings straightness, hollow brings fullness, worn brings renewal, little brings attainment, and much brings confusion—all are the results of embracing the one. Thus the chapter concludes with embracing the one.\n\nNot displaying oneself brings clarity.\n\nThe eye does not see itself, so it can see things. The mirror does not illuminate itself, so it can illuminate things. If it were to see or illuminate itself, it would be too occupied with itself to attend to other things.\n\nNot asserting oneself brings distinction.\n\nNot self-promoting brings achievement.\n\nNot boasting brings merit.\n\nNot self-aggrandizing brings longevity.\n\nIt is only because one does not contend that the world cannot contend with him.\n\nNot displaying oneself, not asserting oneself, not self-promoting, not self-aggrandizing—all are aspects of not contending. Thus the chapter concludes with not contending.\n\nThe ancients’ saying that \"the crooked is preserved whole\"—was this an empty claim? Truly, wholeness is its return. The world takes straightness as right and crookedness as wrong, yet when one follows principle in the world, one cannot avoid being crooked at times. Thus the chapter concludes by restating: Was this an empty claim? Truly, wholeness is its return. What is called \"wholeness\" is not merely preserving the body; internally, it preserves the body, and externally, it preserves things. Both self and things are preserved, and when one returns to one’s nature, then one’s straightness is great indeed.\n\n**Chapter 23: Few Words, Naturalness**\nFew words are natural. Words that arise naturally are simple and hit the mark; if they are forced and unnatural, they become verbose and hard to believe. Thus it is said: \"The Dao that can be spoken is insipid, invisible, inaudible, and inexhaustible in use\"—this is what is meant by \"few words.\"\n\nWhirlwinds do not last the morning; sudden rains do not last the day. What causes these? Heaven and Earth. Even Heaven and Earth cannot last long—how much less can man? When yin and yang do not contend, wind and rain arrive in due time, neither too swift nor too slow, exhausting their momentum before ceasing. But when yang is excessive above and yin is suppressed below, pent-up and unable to release, this gives rise to whirlwinds and violent rains, as if unable to endure—yet their force cannot last the day. The sages of old spoke sparingly and acted plainly, all following their natural course, thus enduring without exhaustion. The world may grow weary of this, deeming it inferior to clever rhetoric that pleases the ear or strange conduct that astonishes the world, unaware that such things cannot last.\n\nThus, those who engage with the Dao: those who align with the Dao are one with the Dao; those who align with virtue are one with virtue; those who align with loss are one with loss. Those who are one with the Dao—the Dao delights in obtaining them; those who are one with virtue—virtue delights in obtaining them; those who are one with loss—loss delights in obtaining them. Confucius said: \"If one is committed to benevolence, there is nothing to hate.\" If commitment to benevolence is like this, how much more so for commitment to the Dao? If one truly engages with the Dao, then what one does that accords with the Dao obtains the Dao; what accords with virtue obtains virtue. Even if one errs, though the error lies in one’s actions, one must still gain something of the Dao and virtue.\n\nWhen trust is insufficient, there is distrust. Those who do not know the Dao lack firm faith in it; when they err, they doubt it, and thus grow even more distrustful. Only those who know the Dao do not let gains and losses cause them to doubt it.\n\n**Chapter 24: The Unstable Cannot Stand**\nOne who stands on tiptoe cannot stand firm; one who takes long strides cannot walk far. Those who display themselves are not clear; those who assert themselves are not distinguished; those who boast have no merit; those who aggrandize themselves do not endure. No one lacks the ability to stand or walk, yet if one deems standing insufficient and adds tiptoeing, or deems walking insufficient and adds long strides, one will lose one’s ability to stand or walk. Those who display, assert, aggrandize, or boast of themselves are the same. In relation to the Dao, they are called \"leftover food and parasitic growths.\" Just as eating to satiety is enough—excess leads to illness—just as the four limbs are complete—excess is a burden—so too do things sometimes detest such excess. Thus, those who possess the Dao do not dwell in it.\n\n**Chapter 25: The Thing That Is Mixed and Complete**\nThere is a thing mixed and complete, born before Heaven and Earth. The Dao is neither clear nor turbid, neither high nor low, neither coming nor going, neither good nor evil—it is mixed and forms a body. In humans, it is called nature. Thus it is said: \"There is a thing mixed and complete.\" No one knows its origin; it is profoundly constant and abiding, while Heaven and Earth are born within it.\n\nSilent and empty, it stands alone and does not change; it circulates without end and can be the mother of the world. Silent, without sound; empty, without form—it stands alone without peer and never alters. It moves through all things without exhaustion. When it stoops to nurture the myriad things, it is their mother.\n\nI do not know its name; I style it \"Dao,\" and by force call it \"great.\" The Dao is originally nameless. The sage sees that all things proceed from it, so styles it \"Dao\"; sees that nothing surpasses it, so by force calls it \"great.\" Yet in truth, it cannot be named. \"Great\" means passing; passing means far; far means returning. Seeking it from greatness, it passes and departs; seeking it from departure, it is too far to reach. Though it passes and is far, seeking it in return—one’s heart is sufficient.\n\nThus the Dao is great, Heaven is great, Earth is great, and the king is also great. Within the realm, there are four greats, and the king occupies one of them. Humans emulate Earth; Earth emulates Heaven; Heaven emulates the Dao; the Dao emulates spontaneity. From the perspective of the Dao, even Heaven, Earth, and the king are not truly great. Yet the world is accustomed to knowing the greatness of these three and does not believe in the greatness of the Dao. Thus it is stated plainly: Humans are not as great as Earth; Earth is not as great as Heaven; Heaven is not as great as the Dao; the Dao is not as great as spontaneity. Yet if humans could return to their nature for even a day, they would fully encompass these three.\n\n**Chapter 26: Heaviness as the Root of Lightness**\nHeaviness is the root of lightness; stillness is the ruler of restlessness. All things: the light cannot bear the heavy; the small cannot govern the great; the unmoving enables movement; the still controls the restless. Thus lightness takes heaviness as its root; restlessness takes stillness as its ruler. Therefore, the sage travels all day without leaving the heavy supplies. Though there are splendid sights and tranquil dwellings, he moves with transcendent ease, not departing from the heavy supplies. Though the sights are delightful, he must have a tranquil dwelling—so indispensable are heaviness and stillness.\n\nHow can the lord of ten thousand chariots treat his person lightly in the world? The lord’s person bears the world; if he treats it lightly, he is not fit to bear the world. Lightness loses ministers; restlessness loses the ruler. Lightness and restlessness are never fitting. If the ruler is light, ministers know he is not dependable; if ministers are restless, the ruler knows their aims are selfish. Thus it is said: Lightness loses ministers; restlessness loses the ruler.\n\n**Chapter 27: Good Travel Leaves No Tracks**\nGood travel leaves no tracks.\n\nRiding the principle in motion, thus leaving no tracks.\nGood speech bears no flaws or blame;\nspeaking only in due season, thus words fill the world without fault.\n\nGood reckoning requires no counting rods—\nthe numbers of the ten thousand things all arrayed before one,\nknowing without calculation, what need for counting?\n\nGood closure uses no bolt or bar yet cannot be opened;\ngood binding uses no cord or knot yet cannot be undone.\n\nThe person of perfect virtue, in relation to the ten thousand things,\nis as a mother to her child:\nthough she sets them free, they do not depart.\nThus, without bolts she can close;\nwithout cords she can bind.\n\nTherefore, the sage is ever good at saving people,\nand so there are no outcasts;\never good at saving things,\nand so there is nothing discarded.\n\nThose who rely on defenses and calculations,\nset bolts to close,\nhold cords to bind—\nhow little their strength reaches!\n\nThe sage’s way with people is not merely to tolerate them,\nbut to skillfully save them.\nIf I do not discard others,\nhow can others not turn to me?\nThis is called inheriting illumination.\n\nSaving people from peril and hardship\nis not the greatest form of rescue.\nWhen they drift through the cycles of birth and death,\nobscured by things,\nand I extend my utmost clarity to them,\nso that the benighted all become bright—\nlike lamps passed one to another,\ntransmitted without cease—\nthis is called skillfully saving people.\n\nThus, the good person is the teacher of the not-good;\nthe not-good person is the resource of the good.\nIf one does not value one’s teacher,\ndoes not cherish one’s resource,\nthough wise, one is greatly deluded.\nThis is called the essential mystery.\n\nThe sage’s subtlety—\neven the wise cannot fully comprehend it.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Eight: Knowing the Male**\n\nKnow the male, yet hold to the female—\nbecome the world’s valley.\nAs the world’s valley, constant virtue never departs,\nand one returns to the state of infancy.\n\nKnow the white, yet hold to the black—\nbecome the world’s model.\nAs the world’s model, constant virtue never falters,\nand one returns to the boundless.\n\nKnow honor, yet hold to disgrace—\nbecome the world’s hollow.\nAs the world’s hollow, constant virtue is fulfilled,\nand one returns to simplicity.\n\nMale and female, first and last—these reach me.\nWhite and black, light and dark—these reach me.\nHonor and disgrace, noble and base—these reach me.\nAll desire to be first and hate to be last,\nto be bright and hate to be dark,\nto be noble and hate to be base—\nsuch is the nature of things.\n\nYet the reach of first and last is not as pressing as light and dark,\nnor is the reach of light and dark as deep as noble and base.\nThe sages of old cast off delusion to seek the recovery of their nature.\nThe clearer their nature, the lower their guard;\nthe lower their guard, the thicker their virtue;\nthe thicker their virtue, the greater their return.\n\nFor to know and yet not act is not as perfect as\nto know and yet refrain from acting.\nKnow the male, yet hold to the female—\nthis is to know one’s nature.\nWhen one knows nature and stills the heart of contention,\nall who vie to be first in the world will turn to them,\nlike water flowing to a valley, none turning away.\nYet this is like an infant—able to receive but not yet to use.\n\nThus it is said: *Return to the state of infancy.*\nKnow the white, yet hold to the black—\nthis is to see one’s nature.\nDwelling in darkness while gazing upon light,\nnone in the world can escape its form.\nThus, when the many take it as their model,\nthough it responds to the ten thousand things,\nthe model never errs, its use never exhausts.\nThus it is said: *Return to the boundless.*\n\nKnow honor, yet hold to disgrace—\nthis is to recover one’s nature.\nAll delusions extinguished, abiding in disgrace without resentment,\nvast as an empty valley, things come and one responds—\nvirtue is sufficient here, nature pure and unadulterated.\nThus it is said: *Return to simplicity.*\nWhen simplicity is scattered, it becomes vessels;\nthe sage employs it to become a leader of officials.\nThus, great governance does not sever.\n\nThe sage, having returned to simplicity,\nscatters it again to form vessels, responding to the ten thousand things.\nLike a ruler dividing governance to establish officials,\nthis follows the natural course—\nthough it governs, there is no severing.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Nine: Seeking to Grasp the World**\n\nThose who seek to grasp the world and act upon it—\nI see they will not succeed.\nThe sage does not take the world;\nthe ten thousand things turn to them,\nand they cannot but receive it.\nIn governing the world, they do not act upon it,\nbut remove its harms by following the ten thousand things’ natural course.\nIf one seeks to grasp and act upon it, it cannot be attained.\n\nThe world is a sacred vessel—\nit cannot be acted upon.\nThose who act upon it ruin it;\nthose who grasp it lose it.\n\nAll things cannot be acted upon.\nEven a gathering of a hundred people,\nif it does not follow their natural course but acts recklessly,\nwill surely meet with discord and resistance—\nhow much more the world?\nThough small things with few people may be seized by force or cunning,\nwhen it comes to the greatness of the world, with its divine ruler,\nif one does not await its natural turning, there will be rebellion;\nif one does not allow its natural governance, there will be chaos.\n\nThus, things may go forth or follow,\nmay warm or chill,\nmay strengthen or weaken,\nmay bear or destroy.\nTherefore, the sage eliminates excess, extravagance, and extremity.\n\nYin and yang contend, high and low incline,\ngreat and small interact—\nsome go forth ahead, some follow behind,\nsome warm with breath, some chill with wind,\nsome are strengthened by increase, some weakened by decrease,\nsome are borne to completion, some are shattered and destroyed—\nall are the natural course of things, an inescapable tendency.\n\nYet the foolish of the world, acting for private gain and seeking advantage,\nresist and defy it—\ntheir ruin is either overturning or breaking.\nOnly the sage knows it cannot be opposed,\nand so follows it, eliminating excess, extravagance, and extremity,\npreventing it from going too far and harming things,\nso the world remains free of disaster.\nThis is the perfection of non-action.\n\nEven Yao and Tang could not avoid floods and droughts,\nyet they never came to ruin—\nthis is why.\nThe *Yi*’s *Tai* hexagram says:\n*\"The ruler, in accordance with it, regulates the Way of heaven and earth,\nassists the harmony of heaven and earth,\nand thereby aids the people.\"*\nThe three yang lines are within, the three yin lines without—\nthings have reached their utmost flourishing.\nThe sage fears excess will harm life,\nso regulates and assists it, preventing it from going too far.\nThis is what is meant by eliminating excess, extravagance, and extremity.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Thirty: Aiding the Ruler with the Dao**\n\nOne who aids a ruler with the Dao\ndoes not use arms to strengthen the world—\nsuch affairs swiftly return.\nThe sage uses arms only when unavoidable,\nand even then seeks not to overpower the world.\nThough they may prevail, their misfortune will surely return to them.\nKing Ling of Chu, King Min of Qi, the First Emperor of Qin, Emperor Wu of Han—\nsome perished themselves, some brought disaster to their descendants.\nWhat people detest, what spirits abhor—\nnone have escaped this fate.\n\nWhere armies camp, brambles grow;\nafter great wars, years of famine follow.\nWhere arms are present, the people’s affairs are neglected—\nfields go untended.\nAfter war, killing energy prevails—\nthe harvest is damaged.\nThis is true of all warfare,\nhow much more so for those who use arms to overpower?\n\nThe good warrior is resolute, but does not dare to take by force.\nResolute, yet not boastful;\nresolute, yet not vaunting;\nresolute, yet not arrogant;\nresolute, yet only when unavoidable;\nresolute, yet not overbearing.\nBoasting, vaunting, arrogance, and overbearing—\nthese four arise from not being unavoidable.\n\nThings in their prime grow old—\nthis is called not following the Dao.\nWhat does not follow the Dao perishes early.\nAll things are thus:\nonly those who embody the Dao,\nthough complete, seem incomplete,\nthough full, seem empty—\nnever in their prime, thus never growing old,\nnever dying.\n\nTo use arms to overpower the world is to be in one’s prime—\ncan one avoid growing old? Avoid death?\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Thirty-One: Fine Arms**\n\nFine arms are instruments of ill omen—\nsome things detest them.\nTherefore, those who embody the Dao do not dwell with them.\n\nTo employ them in rescuing from peril yet not make them a constant practice—\nthis is called \"not dwelling with them.\"\nThe noble person at rest values the left;\nin employing arms, values the right.\nArms are instruments of ill omen,\nnot the instruments of the noble person.\nOnly when unavoidable are they employed;\ntranquility and simplicity are supreme.\nVictory is not deemed beautiful—\nthose who deem it beautiful delight in killing.\nThose who delight in killing cannot realize their will in the world.\n\nAuspicious affairs esteem the left;\ninauspicious affairs esteem the right.\nThe deputy general stands on the left;\nthe supreme general stands on the right—\nthis is to say, in positions of command, they are arrayed as for mourning rites.\nWhen the slain are many, mourn them with sorrowful weeping.\nWhen victorious in battle, observe mourning rites.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Two: The Dao Is Eternally Nameless**\n\nThe Dao is eternally nameless,\nunhewn wood, though small—\nnone in the world dare make it a subject.\nWere lords and kings able to guard it,\nthe myriad things would of themselves submit.\n\nThe nature of unhewn wood is the Dao—\nthe Dao is eternally nameless,\nthus its nature too cannot be named.\nAs a thing, when spread forth, it is present everywhere;\nwhen gathered in, it does not fill even a hair’s tip—\nthis is why, though small, it cannot be made a subject.\nThus, the humble commoner who guards it\nfinds dust, chaff, and husks sufficient to mold Yao and Shun,\nwhile the exalted lord and king who cannot guard it\nsees the myriad things refuse to submit.\n\nHeaven and earth unite to send down sweet dew—\nthe people, without command, of themselves receive it evenly.\n\nThe ascending and descending of the harmonious qi unite as one,\nsending down sweet dew—\nsilently it covers the myriad things, none left uneven.\nThe sage embodies the utmost Dao to respond to all beings,\njust as the dew reaches all without exception—\nthis is how he makes the myriad things submit.\n\nWhen names begin to be established,\nonce names exist, one must also know where to stop.\nKnowing where to stop is how one avoids peril.\nThe sage scatters the unhewn to make vessels,\nusing vessels to establish names—\nhow could he indulge in names and forget the unhewn,\npursue the branch and lose the root?\nHe merely knows to return to nature.\nThus, he rides the myriad things without peril.\n\nThe Dao’s presence in the world\nis like that of streams and valleys to rivers and seas.\n\nRivers and seas are where waters gather;\nstreams and valleys are where waters divide.\nThe Dao is the ancestor of the myriad things;\nthe myriad things are the branches of the Dao.\nAll are water—\nthus streams and valleys return to where they gather;\nall are Dao—\nthus the myriad things submit to their ancestor.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Three: Knowing Others**\n\nKnowing others is wisdom;\nknowing oneself is clarity.\nDiscernment is wisdom;\nfreedom from delusion is clarity.\nThe mind of discernment is not yet free from distinctions,\nthus it reaches only to knowing others and not oneself.\nWhen delusions are exhausted, there are no distinctions—\nthus one can know oneself and then extend to others.\n\nOvercoming others requires force;\novercoming oneself requires strength.\nForce can reach others but not oneself;\nmastering oneself and returning to nature\nis beyond what force can reach—\nthis may be called strength.\n\nOne who knows contentment is rich.\nOne who knows contentment finds sufficiency in whatever befalls—\nthus is never not rich.\nThough possessing the world,\nif one clings to a heart of insufficiency,\nthis is to remain poor for a lifetime.\n\nOne who practices perseverance has resolve.\nNot contending with things yet unceasingly strengthening oneself—\nnothing can wrest away one’s resolve.\n\nOne who does not lose their place endures.\nThough things change endlessly,\nthe heart never loses its ground—\nthus endures.\n\nOne who dies yet does not perish is long-lived.\nThe change of death and life is great,\nyet one’s nature remains serene and undying—\nthis is how the ancients’ utmost persons neither live nor die.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Four: The Great Dao Spreads**\n\nThe great Dao spreads—\nhow it may be left or right!\n\nSpreading, it is without limitation, without exclusion—\nthus it reaches everywhere, above and below, in all directions.\nThe myriad things rely on it to live, yet it does not refuse;\nits work complete, it does not claim possession.\n\nIt nurtures and sustains the myriad things yet does not act as master—\nit may be named as small.\nThe myriad things return to it yet it does not act as master—\nit may be named as great.\nThus, the sage never deems himself great,\nand so accomplishes his greatness.\nIf one is great yet harbors the mind of greatness,\none becomes small.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Five: Holding the Great Image**\n\nHold the great image—\nthe world will come.\nThe Dao is neither being nor non-being,\nthus it is called the great image.\nWere it manifestly formed,\nit would have likenesses and differences—\nlikenesses would attract, differences repel.\nAttraction would bring them, repulsion would drive them away—\nthis would not suffice to make the world come.\n\nComing yet unharmed,\npeaceful, at ease, secure.\nWhere there are attractions and aversions,\nthere are benefits and harms.\nWhen attractions and aversions are exhausted,\nthen toward the myriad things there is no harm—\nthus the kingly person is without disquiet, without disturbance, without peril.\n\nMusic and bait may halt passing travelers—\nthe Dao’s utterance is bland, without flavor,\nseen yet not sufficient to behold,\nheard yet not sufficient to listen to,\nused yet inexhaustible.\n\nSetting out music and bait to await comers—\nare these not sufficient to halt passing travelers?\nYet when the music ends and the bait is consumed,\nthey will abandon them and depart.\nAs for holding the great image to await the world—\nthe world does not know to love it,\nhow much less could it be hated?\nThough without scent, flavor, form, or sound to please,\nits use is inexhaustible.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Six: Subtle Clarity**\n\nTo contract it, first expand it;\nto weaken it, first strengthen it;\nto abolish it, first exalt it;\nto take it, first give it—\nthis is called subtle clarity.\n\nHad one never given yet suddenly taken,\nthe momentum would not be fully extended,\nthe principle would not be sufficient—\nmomentum not fully extended, taking would be difficult;\nprinciple not sufficient, things would not submit.\nYet this verges on employing cunning—\nwhat difference is there from Guan Zhong or Sun Wu?\nThe sage’s path and the vulgar’s traces\nmay indeed appear similar.\nThe sage rides principle,\nwhile the vulgar employ cunning—\nriding principle is like medicine, skillfully responding to illness;\nemploying cunning is like merchants, skillfully seeking profit.\n\nSoftness and weakness overcome hardness and strength.\nThe sage knows hardness and strength are not to be relied upon,\nthus abides in softness and weakness.\nThe world’s hardness and strength vie and clash,\nwhile I alone remain soft and weak, awaiting them.\nWhen the great are wounded and the small perish,\nI sit unmoving, awaiting their exhaustion—\nthis is called overcoming.\nThough the sage does not intentionally do this to overcome things—\nknowing the natural course of events,\nhe dwells in their spontaneity.\n\nFish cannot be removed from the depths;\nthe state’s sharp instruments cannot be shown to others.\n\nThe fish’s advantage lies not in claws or teeth to overcome things—\nwhile it abides in the deep abyss,\neven the strong and forceful cannot seize it.\nOnce removed from the depths to dry land,\nit is but a helpless creature—what can it do?\nThe sage dwells in softness and weakness,\nand the hard and strong cannot harm him—\nnot only cannot harm him,\nbut will in the end be controlled by him.\nIs this not the state’s sharp instrument?\nFish are only controlled once removed from the depths;\nthe sage, abiding in softness and weakness without weariness,\nthus ultimately subdues the world—\nhow could this be shared with the common crowd?\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Seven: The Dao’s Constant Non-Action**\n\nThe Dao is ever non-active, yet nothing is left undone—\nnot that it accomplishes all things through non-action,\nbut that non-action is the intent behind all it does.\n\nShould lords and kings abide by this,\nthe myriad things will transform of themselves.\nAs transformation stirs and desires arise,\nI would still them with the nameless uncarved block.\n\nThe sage transforms things through non-action;\ntransformation begins in non-action,\nthen proceeds to action,\nand gradually reaches creation.\nIt is like the growth of an infant—\nthe more human artifice accumulates,\nthe more it flourishes.\nThus, the decline of the Three Dynasties\nand the shifts in human nature\nhave grown ever more severe with time.\nWhen desires arise and those above\nand all under heaven follow them blindly,\nthe changes become too numerous to recount.\nYet if, at the very moment of their arising,\none does not move to act,\nbut instead stills them with the nameless uncarved block,\nperhaps they may yet be halted.\n\nThe nameless uncarved block itself desires nothing;\nthrough non-desire, it quiets the world,\nand the world settles of itself.\n\nThe sage harbors no thought of embracing simplicity within,\nnor leaves any trace of it without—\nthus the uncarved block remains whole and its use vast.\nIf the desire for simplicity still lingers in the heart,\none strays far from it indeed.\n\n*Laozi Jie, Scroll One*\n*(Masters Section, Daoist School, Laozi Jie)*\n\n**Imperially Commissioned Complete Library of the Four Treasuries**\n*Laozi Jie, Scroll Two*\n*Composed by Su Zhe of the Song*\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Eight: \"The Highest Virtue Does Not Act as Virtue\"**\n\nThe highest virtue does not act as virtue—thus it possesses virtue.\nThe lesser virtue does not lose virtue—thus it has no virtue.\nThe sage follows the heart’s desires without overstepping the mark,\nnot by deliberate intent at virtue, yet virtue is naturally sufficient.\nThose below, knowing virtue’s worth, strive to preserve it,\nbut this is merely self-completion—what virtue is there in that?\n\nThe highest virtue acts without acting and without purpose;\nthe lesser virtue acts with purpose.\nTo act without purpose yet still harbor purpose is still to act.\nOnly acting without acting and without purpose can be called true non-action.\nThose below cannot accomplish without acting,\nyet even in their action, purpose remains—\nthey are not those who act blindly without method.\n\nThe highest benevolence acts without purpose;\nthe highest righteousness acts with purpose.\nBoth benevolence and righteousness cannot escape action,\nbut their distinction lies in this:\nbenevolence excels by acting without purpose,\nwhile righteousness achieves merit by acting with purpose.\n\nVirtue has high and low, yet benevolence and righteousness have only high and no low—why?\nBecause lesser virtue lies between benevolence and righteousness,\nand what is below even righteousness is not worth mentioning.\n\nThe highest ritual acts, yet none respond—\nthen it rolls up its sleeves and forces compliance.\nFrom virtue downward to ritual,\nthe sage’s means of ordering the people reach their limit.\nThus, when ritual is enacted and none respond,\nit resorts to force;\nwhen force meets no response,\npunishments arise and weapons are drawn—\nthen it is mere action without method.\n\nTherefore:\nLose the Dao, and virtue follows;\nlose virtue, and benevolence follows;\nlose benevolence, and righteousness follows;\nlose righteousness, and ritual follows.\nRitual is the thinning of loyalty and trust, the harbinger of chaos.\nWhere loyalty and trust exist without ritual,\nloyalty and trust remain unseen.\nWhen ritual is established,\nthe beauty of loyalty and trust shines forth externally—\nbetween ruler and minister, father and son,\nhusband and wife, friends—\noutwardly resplendent, yet inwardly hollow.\nThus, to follow it is order; to oppose it is chaos.\nThe distance between order and chaos is thinner than a hair’s breadth—\nhence it is called the harbinger of chaos.\n\n\"Foreknowledge\" is the flower of the Dao, the beginning of folly.\nThe sage surveys the myriad things,\ntheir rights and wrongs, gains and losses,\nall laid bare as in a mirror’s reflection—\nnothing escapes its sight.\nWhat, then, is \"before\" or \"after\"?\nThe common people’s vision is limited to the eye,\ntheir hearing to the ear,\ntheir thoughts to the heart,\ntheir defenses to the realm of things.\nThey exhaust their intellect to seek understanding,\nand when they chance upon some insight,\nthey deem themselves enlightened,\nunaware that this is the very beginning of folly.\n\nThus, the great man dwells in thickness, not thinness;\nin substance, not ornament.\nTherefore, he discards that and embraces this.\nThe world’s petty men delight in their small gains below\nand forget what is above—\nthey favor thinness and neglect thickness,\npluck flowers and discard fruit.\nWho but the great man can discard that and embrace this?\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Nine: \"Those of Old Who Attained the One\"**\n\nThose of old who attained the One:\nHeaven attained the One and became clear;\nEarth attained the One and became tranquil;\nthe spirits attained the One and became numinous;\nthe valleys attained the One and became full;\nthe myriad things attained the One and came to life;\nthe lords and kings attained the One and became the standard for all under heaven.\n\nThe One is the Dao.\nAll things that become things do so through the Dao.\nThe people of the world see things and forget the Dao.\nThey know only that heaven is clear,\nearth is tranquil,\nspirits are numinous,\nvalleys are full,\nthe myriad things come to life,\nand lords and kings are the standard for all under heaven—\nyet they do not know that what enables them to attain these\nis simply the presence of the Dao.\n\nTheir attainment of the One is the same.\nWithout clarity, heaven would fear splitting;\nwithout tranquility, earth would fear bursting;\nwithout numinosity, spirits would fear fading;\nwithout fullness, valleys would fear exhaustion;\nwithout life, the myriad things would fear annihilation;\nwithout the standard, lords and kings, though noble and high, would fear collapse.\n\n\"Attainment\" speaks of the extreme.\nHeaven not attaining the One does not immediately split,\nearth not attaining the One does not immediately burst,\nspirits not attaining the One do not immediately fade,\nthe myriad things not attaining the One do not immediately perish,\nlords and kings not attaining the One do not immediately collapse—\nyet in the extreme, this is where they must arrive.\n\nThus, the noble takes the humble as its root,\nthe high takes the low as its foundation.\nThe vastness of heaven and earth,\nthe nobility of lords and kings—\nall arise from the attainment of the One.\nYet what, after all, is the One?\nInvisible to the eye, intangible to the grasp—\nit is the most subtle of heaven and earth,\nwhat we call humble and low.\n\nThus, lords and kings call themselves \"orphaned,\" \"widowed,\" \"unworthy\"—\nis this not taking the humble as their root?\nThose who used these titles in the past\nmerely grasped the root and forgot the branch.\n\nThus, to assemble the parts of a carriage is not to make a carriage.\nDo not desire it to be lustrous like jade or coarse like stone.\nWheels, spokes, canopy, axle, crossbar, yoke, hub, linchpin—\neach part can be counted,\nyet the carriage itself cannot be counted.\nOnly then do we know that \"nothing\" is what makes the carriage—\nthis is what is meant by \"nothing’s use as use.\"\n\nThen do heaven and earth become heaven and earth through greatness?\nDo lords and kings become lords and kings through nobility?\nWithin greatness and nobility, the One resides—\nthis is what makes them heaven and earth, lords and kings,\nyet none know it.\n\nThus, the One dwells in nobility yet is not noble,\ndwells in humility yet is not humble—\nnot like jade, lustrous yet unable to be humble,\nor stone, coarse yet unable to be noble.\n\n**Chapter Forty: \"Reversion Is the Movement of the Dao\"**\n\nReversion is the movement of the Dao.\nReturning to one’s nature is stillness,\nyet in its quiescent non-action,\nwhen stimulated, it penetrates all things under heaven—\nthis is the origin of movement.\n\nWeakness is the function of the Dao.\nThe Dao is formless and soundless—\nnothing under heaven is weaker than the Dao,\nyet nothing under heaven is stronger.\nThis is how it can function for the myriad things.\n\nHeaven and earth and the myriad things are born of being;\nbeing is born of non-being.\n\nThe world does not know that stillness is movement,\nweakness is strength—\nthus it is told of the origin of things.\nFor all things under heaven,\nwe hear of the mother controlling the child,\nbut never of the child controlling the mother.\n\n**Chapter Forty-One: \"When the Highest Scholars Hear of the Dao\"**\n\nWhen the highest scholars hear of the Dao, they diligently practice it.\nWhen middling scholars hear of the Dao, they half-believe, half-doubt it.\nWhen the lowest scholars hear of the Dao, they laugh loudly at it.\nIf it were not laughed at, it would not be the Dao.\n\nThe Dao is formless, invisible,\nsoundless, inaudible.\nWithout first knowing the falsity of the myriad things,\nwithout the vastness of emptiness or the clarity of insight,\none cannot help but disbelieve.\nThus, the lowest scholars hear of the Dao and deem it absurd, fantastical—\nand laugh at it.\nThe middling scholars hear of the Dao and waver,\nappearing and disappearing, doubting it.\nOnly those who see it clearly\nthen practice it diligently, embracing it without slack.\n\nConfucius said:\n\"To speak to him without weariness—was it not Yan Hui?\"\nThis is what is meant by the highest scholars.\n\nThus, those who establish teachings have said:\nTo establish is to set forth what is ancient. Those who set forth teachings in antiquity held such sayings, and Laozi adopted them below—what is expounded here is the same.\n\nThe luminous Dao seems dim,\nilluminating all yet not scrutinizing.\nAdvancing in the Dao seems like retreating,\nas if halting yet not moving—none in the world can surpass its swiftness.\nThe level Dao seems uneven,\nnow smooth, now rough, yet wherever it reaches, all is made level without ever being shaved down.\nSupreme virtue resembles a valley,\nfor supreme virtue does not assert virtue, like a valley’s emptiness.\nGreat whiteness seems sullied—\nif whiteness remains unstained, this belongs to the fastidious, not the sage.\nVast virtue seems insufficient,\nfor when it is so boundless that nothing can be added, it merely stops here—this is not true vastness.\nEstablished virtue seems negligent,\nfor it follows the self-so of things without imposing itself; outwardly it appears indolent, yet in truth it is established.\nTrue substance seems mutable,\nfor one who embodies the sage and embraces the spirit, adapting to things without losing constancy, outwardly appears to change.\nThe great square has no corners,\nfor it preserves its vastness without carving sharp angles.\nThe great vessel is slow to complete,\nfor its greatness cannot be put to immediate use.\nThe great tone is soundless,\nbeyond what the ear can hear.\nThe great image has no form,\nbeyond what the eye can see.\nThe Dao is hidden, without name.\nOnly the Dao is good at bestowing and accomplishing.\n\nThe Dao abides nowhere yet is nowhere absent. All these twelve manifestations appear in things, yet the Dao in its wholeness remains hidden, without name. Only by dwelling where it dwells, extending its surplus to bestow upon what is lacking, do things rely on it to be brought to completion.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Two**\nThe Dao gives birth to the One,\nthe One gives birth to the Two,\nthe Two give birth to the Three,\nthe Three give birth to the myriad things.\nThe myriad things bear yin and embrace yang,\nwith qi harmonizing them in the center.\n\nThe Dao is neither One nor Two, yet when it pairs with things, the Dao is One while things are not. Thus, the Dao is named as One, yet the Dao is not the One. One and One make Two, Two and One make Three—from this onward, the myriad things are born. Though things number in the tens of thousands and differ in form, none fail to bear yin and embrace yang, with qi harmonizing them in the center. This is because things are born from the Three, and the Three are born from the One—such is the natural principle.\n\nWhat people despise are only the orphaned, the widowed, and the unworthy, yet kings and lords use these as their titles. People of the world, not knowing the origin of the myriad things, all scorn the few and small while prizing the many and great. Yet kings and lords, though exalted, call themselves orphaned, widowed, and unworthy—those of ancient understanding had already grasped this.\n\nThus, sometimes diminishing leads to increase, and sometimes increasing leads to diminishment. What others teach, I also teach: “The strong and overbearing do not meet a natural death.” I will take this as the father of all teachings.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Three**\nThe softest in the world gallops through the hardest.\nThat which has no substance enters where there is no gap.\nThrough this, I know the benefit of non-action.\n\nUsing hardness to oppose hardness—if it does not break, it shatters.\nUsing softness to oppose hardness—softness does not wear away, nor does hardness suffer harm.\nSeek this in things, and water is the example.\nUsing what exists to enter what exists—resistance prevents reception.\nUsing what does not exist to enter what exists—what does not exist never wearies, nor is what exists ever aware.\nSeek this in things, and the spirit is the example.\nThus, only the sage, through non-action, can command the many strong and move through all things.\n\nThe teaching without words, the benefit of non-action—few in the world attain these.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Four**\nFame or self—which is dearer?\nSelf or wealth—which is greater?\nTo put self before fame, to value self and scorn wealth—this is still not forgetting the self.\nOne who forgets the self does not possess the self—how much less fame or wealth?\nYet to value the self for the sake of the world, one cannot but forget the self.\nThus, let the world know that fame is not worth cherishing, that wealth is not worth amassing, and only then will they know to value the self. Knowing to value the self, only then will they know to forget the self—this is Laozi’s intent.\n\nGain or loss—which is more harmful?\nNot gaining is taken as harmful, but once gained, the fear of loss is a harm even greater than not gaining. Only by equalizing having and lacking, gain and loss, can one be free from harm.\n\nExcessive love must bring great expense,\nhoarding much must bring heavy loss.\nKnow contentment, and you will not be disgraced;\nknow when to stop, and you will not be imperiled—\nthus can you endure long.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Five**\nGreat perfection seems flawed,\nyet its use is never exhausted.\nGreat fullness seems empty,\nyet its use is never depleted.\nThe world takes non-flawed as perfection, so perfection must have exhaustion.\nIt takes non-empty as fullness, so fullness must have depletion.\nThe sage aims for great perfection yet does not guard against its flaws,\nseeks great fullness yet does not despise its emptiness—\nthus perfection is never exhausted, and fullness is never depleted.\n\nGreat straightness seems bent,\ngreat skill seems clumsy,\ngreat eloquence seems inarticulate.\nStraightness that does not bend will break;\nfollowing principle in action, though crooked, is straight.\nSkill that does not seem clumsy will labor;\nentrusting things to their nature, though clumsy, is skill.\nEloquence that does not seem inarticulate will be exhausted;\nspeaking according to principle, though inarticulate, is eloquence.\n\nRestlessness overcomes cold,\nstillness overcomes heat.\nPurity and tranquility set the world right.\nPerfection without flaw, fullness without emptiness, straightness without bending, skill without clumsiness, eloquence without inarticulateness—these are like restlessness that cannot be still, stillness that cannot be restless. Restlessness can overcome cold but not heat; stillness can overcome heat but not cold. Both are bound to one side and not the mean. Only in serene purity, unstained by any one thing—neither perfect nor flawed, neither full nor empty, neither straight nor bent, neither skillful nor clumsy, neither eloquent nor inarticulate—can one overcome all and serve as the world’s standard.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Six**\nWhen the world follows the Dao,\nwarhorses are retired to fertilize fields.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Six (continued)**\nWhen the world abides in its proper place,\nthere is no strife, and all governs itself—\nthus warhorses are retired to fertilize fields.\nWhen the world lacks the Dao,\nwarhorses breed even at the suburbs.\n\nNo crime is greater than indulging desire,\nno calamity greater than discontent,\nno fault greater than covetousness.\nTo display what is desirable to others is already a crime;\nthose who never find contentment court greater calamity still;\nthose who must obtain what they desire incur the gravest fault.\nEven a common man, harboring but one of these,\nbrings misfortune upon himself—\nhow much more so when lords and kings act thus,\nfor it is from this that warhorses arise.\n\nThus, the contentment of knowing contentment is constant contentment.\nThe contented man finds sufficiency wherever he dwells,\nand so nothing is lacking.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Seven**\nWithout stepping beyond the door, one knows the world;\nwithout peering through the window, one sees the Dao of Heaven.\nThe farther one goes, the less one knows.\nNature as substance fills and pervades the cosmos,\nwithout distinction of far or near, past or present.\nThe sages of old, though they never stepped beyond door or window,\nknew all things—\nsimply because their nature was whole.\nPeople of the world, deluded by things,\ndivide their nature between ears and eyes.\nWithin, they are confounded by body and mind;\nwithout, they are obstructed by mountains and rivers.\nTheir sight does not extend beyond the door,\ntheir hearing does not reach beyond the window—\nyet even the smallest gap can block and sever.\nNot knowing that the sage returns to nature to find sufficiency,\nthey seek it outside,\nand so the farther they go, the less they know.\n\nThus, the sage knows without traveling,\nnames without seeing,\nachieves without acting.\nWhat nature reaches is not merely knowledge or naming—\nit is the power to follow the natural course of things,\nto accomplish without labor.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Eight**\nIn the pursuit of learning, one daily accumulates;\nwithout knowing the Dao and yet striving to learn,\nhearing and seeing grow ever more,\nyet without unity, they become a burden.\nConfucius said:\n*“Hear much, select what is good and follow it;\nsee much and remember it—\nthis is secondary knowledge.”*\n\nIn the pursuit of the Dao, one daily diminishes.\nIf for a single day one knows the Dao,\none sees that the ten thousand things are but illusion.\nAbandoning illusion to seek the recovery of nature—\nthis is called diminishing.\nConfucius said to Zigong:\n*“Do you think I am one who learns much and remembers it?”*\n*“Yes, is it not so?”*\n*“No. I unify it with a single thread.”*\n\nDiminish and diminish again,\nuntil one reaches non-action.\nThrough non-action, nothing is left undone.\nTo abandon illusion in pursuit of recovering nature may be called diminishing,\nyet the mind that seeks to abandon illusion still remains.\nOnly when one forgets even this mind,\nwhen nature is pure and nothing is left,\ncan one act without failing in non-action.\n\nTo take the world, one must always act without contrivance;\nthose who contrive cannot take the world.\nAll people have the desire to take the world,\nso they scheme and strive,\ntheir minds manifesting outwardly—\nand things resist them,\nso in the end they cannot succeed.\nThe sage, acting without contrivance, has no schemes;\nhis mind manifests outwardly,\nand things are at peace with him.\nThough he does not seek to take the world,\nthe world comes to him.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Nine**\nThe sage has no fixed mind;\nhe takes the minds of the people as his mind.\nThe good, I treat as good;\nthe not-good, I also treat as good—\nthus virtue is goodness.\nThe trustworthy, I trust;\nthe untrustworthy, I also trust—\nthus virtue is trustworthiness.\n\nVoid and formless,\nhe takes the forms of the ten thousand things as his form.\nIf the void had its own form,\nhow could it shape the ten thousand things?\nThus, the sage has no mind of his own;\nhe takes the minds of the people as his mind.\nWhether good or not-good, he treats all as good;\nwhether trustworthy or not, he treats all as trustworthy.\nGood and not-good lie with them,\nbut my way of treating them as good never changes—\nthis may be called virtuous goodness.\nTrust and distrust lie with them,\nbut my way of trusting never alters—\nthis may be called virtuous trustworthiness.\n\nOtherwise, to favor the good and reject the not-good,\nto trust the trustworthy and reject the untrustworthy—\nhow could this be called *“constantly good at saving people, and so leaving none behind”*?\n\nThe sage in the world is ever cautious,\nfor the world he harmonizes his mind.\nThe people all fix their ears and eyes upon him,\nand the sage treats them all as children.\nThe world’s good and evil, truth and falsehood,\nare each convinced of their own rightness,\nmutually opposing and harming one another,\nuncertain of what to settle upon.\nThe sage, troubled by this,\nis ever cautious for the world,\nharmonizing his mind—\nwithout good or evil, without truth or falsehood,\nhe treats all with unity.\nThey fix their ears and eyes to observe the sage’s judgments,\nbut he meets them all with the simplicity of an infant.\nToward the good, he feels no delight;\ntoward the evil, he feels no resentment.\nThus, the good do not grow proud,\nthe evil do not grow bitter—\nall relax and transform,\nand the world begins to settle.\n\n**Chapter Fifty**\nEmerging from life, entering death—\nnature itself is neither born nor dies.\nTo emerge is to be born; to enter is to die.\nOf those who live, thirteen parts;\nof those who die, thirteen parts;\nof those whose lives lead them to death’s ground, thirteen parts.\n\nThose who use things to extract essence and nourish themselves belong to the living;\nthose who indulge in sound and color, scent and taste, to harm themselves belong to the dead.\nThese two once divided, the way of life and death is set.\nYet I know activity without rest,\nspeech without silence,\nthought without forgetting—\nall hastening toward exhaustion,\nwhich is what is meant by *“those whose lives lead them to death’s ground.”*\nThe way of life and death, spoken of in tens,\nthree parts each—\nis this not nine parts for life and death,\nand one part alone for neither life nor death?\nNeither life nor death—\nthis is what the *Yi* calls *“still and unmoving.”*\nLaozi speaks of the nine but not the one,\nletting people discover it for themselves,\nto glimpse the wonder of thoughtless non-action.\n\nWhy is this so?\nBecause of the thickness of life-generating.\nWhere there is life, there is death—\nthus those who live are also those who die.\nWhen what people rely upon for life is thick,\nthe way of death is ever nine in ten.\n\nI have heard that those skilled in nurturing life,\nwalking on land, do not meet rhinoceros or tiger;\nentering battle, do not avoid armor or weapons.\nThe rhinoceros finds nowhere to thrust its horn,\nthe tiger nowhere to place its claws,\nweapons nowhere to lodge their blades.\nWhy is this so?\nBecause they have no ground for death.\n\nThe sage always dwells in neither life nor death—\nhow could there be ground for death where even life’s ground is absent?\n\n**Chapter Fifty-One**\nThe Dao gives them life,\nvirtue nurtures them,\nthings give them form,\nand circumstances complete them.\nThe Dao is the mother of the ten thousand things—\nthus what gives life to the ten thousand things is the Dao.\nAs it moves and becomes virtue,\nit herds and nourishes the multitude without refusal—\nthus what nurtures the ten thousand things is virtue.\nYet neither Dao nor virtue can shape themselves;\nonly through things do they take form.\nThings cannot complete themselves;\nonly through the interplay of near and far, hard and soft,\naccumulating into circumstances,\ndo the changes of rise and fall, order and chaos, come to completion.\n\nThus, the ten thousand things all revere the Dao and honor virtue. Though form arises from things and completion from circumstances, without the Dao there is no life, and without virtue there is no nurturance—hence the reverence for the Dao and the honor for virtue. The Dao is revered like father and elder brother, virtue honored like lords and kings, for the Dao has no position while virtue has a name.\n\nThe reverence for the Dao and the honor for virtue arise not by command (or: rank) but always by nature. Those who rely on rank to attain reverence and honor are not truly revered or honored. Therefore, the Dao gives them life, virtue nurtures them, raises them, rears them, completes them, ripens them, nourishes them, and shelters them—giving life yet not possessing, acting yet not relying, raising yet not dominating. This is called profound virtue.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Two**\nThe world has a beginning,\nwhich serves as the world’s mother.\nNameless, it is the beginning of Heaven and Earth;\nnamed, it is the mother of the ten thousand things.\nWhen the Dao is still without name,\nit is that by which things find their beginning.\nWhen it comes to have a name,\nit is that by which things find their life.\nThus it is called the beginning, and also the mother—\nits child is the ten thousand things.\nHaving known (or: attained) the mother,\none proceeds to know the child.\nHaving given life to the child,\none returns to guard the mother—\nthus to the end of life one is not imperiled.\n\nThe sage embodies the Dao to encompass all things,\nlike knowing the child through the mother—\nclear and without anything unexamined.\nThough his wisdom suffices to encompass all,\nhe never allows things to obscure the Dao,\nand so he guards the mother to the end.\nBlock the openings, close the gates—\nthroughout life one does not toil.\nOpen the openings, assist the affairs—\nthroughout life one cannot be saved.\n\nAll under Heaven possess this Dao,\nyet they constantly suffer from forgetting the Dao and following things.\nThe eye delights in color, the ear in sound—\nopening the heart that delights in these\nand using these affairs to assist it,\none sinks throughout life and cannot be saved.\nThe sage’s way of never toiling throughout life\nlies solely in blocking and closing,\nnever going forth to follow them.\n\nSeeing the small is called clarity.\nThe harm of delight begins small but gradually grows.\nKnowing that the small will become great\nand closing it—this is called clarity.\n\nGuarding the soft is called strength.\nPursuing what delights one without reflection,\nthinking oneself strong—this is not true strength.\nOnly one who sees delight and knows to fear it\ncan be called strong.\n\nUse its light, return to its clarity—\nleave no disaster to the self.\nThis is called practicing constancy.\nThe worldly open what delights them\nand give themselves over to things,\ngoing forth without return.\nThe sage blocks and closes,\nnot cutting off from things but responding with spirit,\nusing its light while the self does not engage.\nThe ear’s ability to hear, the eye’s to see,\nthe nose’s to smell, the mouth’s to taste,\nthe body’s to touch, the mind’s to think—\nall are what is called light.\nWhen light meets things, things depart but clarity remains undiminished.\nThus one responds to endless changes without exhaustion,\ndisaster does not reach the self,\nand so one’s constant nature remains serene,\npassed down unbroken.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Three**\nIf I were suddenly to have knowledge\nand walk the great Dao,\nonly the practice of contrivance would I fear.\nThose who embody the Dao have no knowledge, no action,\nno contrivance—yet things transform themselves.\nNow, if one suddenly has knowledge\nand walks the great Dao,\nthere is contrivance and establishment,\nwhich is not natural—\nenough to be feared.\n\nThe great Dao is level and smooth,\nyet the people prefer byways.\nThe great Dao is level and easy, without peril or obstruction,\nbut those in the world who do not know it\nconsider it circuitous and distant,\npreferring byways to seek shortcuts.\nThus all who abandon their nature\nand contrive some practice\nare those who desire speed.\n\nThe courts are well-swept,\nthe fields overgrown with weeds,\nthe granaries empty.\nYet they wear embroidered robes,\ncarry sharp swords,\nsate themselves with food and drink,\nand possess surplus wealth and goods—\nthis is called the boast of thieves.\nIs this not contrary to the Dao?\n\nThe vulgar are bright, I alone seem dim;\nthe vulgar are discerning, I alone seem dull.\nHow could one still adorn the branches and neglect the root,\nmaking contrivance one’s affair,\nboasting to teach thieves?\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Four**\nWhat is well established cannot be uprooted,\nwhat is well embraced cannot be lost—\nthus descendants’ sacrifices never cease.\nHow could there be establishment without uprooting,\nembrace without loss?\nOnly the sage knows the truth of nature\nand the falsity of things,\ndiscarding things to cultivate the self.\nHis virtue is full and substantial—\ntruly, nothing is established, yet his establishment cannot be uprooted;\ntruly, nothing is grasped, yet his embrace cannot be lost.\nThus even to his descendants,\nsacrifices never cease.\n\nCultivate it in the self, and its virtue is genuine;\ncultivate it in the family, and its virtue abounds;\ncultivate it in the village, and its virtue grows long;\ncultivate it in the state, and its virtue becomes abundant;\ncultivate it in the world, and its virtue becomes universal.\nThus, observe the self through the self,\nobserve the family through the family,\nobserve the village through the village,\nobserve the state through the state,\nobserve the world through the world.\nHow do I know the world is thus?\nBy this.\n\nWhat lies beyond Heaven and Earth\nis unseen by the vulgar,\nyet its principle can be inferred.\nThe perfection of cultivating the self—\nobserving the self through the self,\nthe family through the family,\nthe village through the village,\nthe state through the state—\nall lie within what I can know.\nBut how do I know that the sage\nobserves the world through the world\nas I observe the self through the self?\nHow could the self be observed through the self,\nyet the world alone not be observed through the world?\nThus it is said: How do I know the world is thus?\nBy this—meaning, also, by observing it through the self.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Five**\nOne who contains profound virtue\nis like a newborn child.\nLaozi’s words on the Dao and virtue\noften compare them to an infant—\nall speak of its essence, not yet its function.\nThe infant is tranquil, without desire—\nits essence is perfect,\nyet when things come, it does not know how to respond,\nso it cannot yet be called function.\n\nPoisonous insects do not sting,\nfierce beasts do not seize,\nbirds of prey do not strike.\nThe Dao has no form or body—\nhow could things see it,\nlet alone harm it?\nWhat causes humans to have form\nis their having a heart-mind.\nThus, with a heart-mind comes form,\nwith form comes opposition,\nand with opposition comes harm.\nBeings without a heart-mind\nhave nothing to oppose—\nhow could they be harmed?\nThe infant reaches this state\nsolely because it has no heart-mind.\n\nBones weak, sinews soft, yet its grip is firm.\nNot knowing the union of male and female,\nyet its organ stirs—\nits essence is at its fullest.\nWithout grasping, it naturally grips;\nwithout desire, it naturally stirs—\nthus one knows its essence is full,\nnot the heart-mind.\n\nAll day it cries without its throat becoming hoarse—\nits harmony is at its fullest.\nThe heart-mind moves, and qi is harmed;\nqi harmed, crying becomes hoarse.\nAll day crying without hoarseness—\nthus one knows its heart-mind does not move\nand its qi is harmonious.\n\nTo know harmony is called constancy.\nHarmony means nothing external harms the internal.\nTo return to one’s destiny is called constancy—\nwhen encountering things, one knows to revert to their root.\n\nTo know harmony is called constancy—\nto obtain the root and respond to the myriad things.\nIn truth, these are one and the same Dao,\nthus both are called constancy.\n\nTo know constancy is called clarity.\nTo augment life is called ominous.\nLife cannot be augmented;\nto desire augmentation is to depart from its true nature.\nOminous indeed!\n\nWhen the heart-mind commands qi, it is called force.\nQi detests reckless action,\nyet when the heart-mind further commands it,\nforce becomes extreme.\nWhen things reach their prime and then age,\nthis is called \"not following the Dao.\"\nWhat does not follow the Dao perishes early.\n\nAugmenting life and commanding qi\nprevents them from following their natural course,\ndaily leading toward rigidity and aging.\nThus, one loses the nature of the infant.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Six: The Knowing Do Not Speak**\nThe knowing do not speak;\nthose who speak do not know.\nBlock the openings, shut the gates,\nblunt the sharpness, untangle the knots,\nsoften the glare, merge with the dust—\nthis is called \"mysterious sameness.\"\n\nThe Dao is not found in speech,\nyet neither is it separate from speech.\nThose who know may not speak,\nthose who speak may not know.\nOnly by blocking the openings and shutting the gates\nto guard against externals,\nblunting sharpness, untangling knots,\nsoftening glare, and merging with dust\nto cultivate the internal—\nsilent and unaligned,\none merges with the Dao.\n\nThus, it cannot be gained through closeness\nnor through distance,\ncannot be gained through benefit\nnor through harm,\ncannot be gained through honor\nnor through disgrace—\ntherefore, it is revered by the world.\n\nIf it could be gained through closeness,\nit could also be gained through distance;\nif through benefit, then through harm;\nif through honor, then through disgrace.\nThose who embody the Dao\nequally embrace the myriad things—\nwho then is close or distant?\nThey view opposition and compliance equally—\nwho then benefits or harms?\nUnknowing of glory or shame—\nwho then is honored or disgraced?\nSuch calculations fall short—\nthis is why it is revered by the world.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Seven: Governing the State with Integrity**\nGovern the state with integrity,\nuse the military with strategy,\ntake the world through non-action.\n\nThe sages of old\nwere gentle with the distant and capable with the near,\nwithout intent to use the military.\nOnly when unavoidable did they engage in campaigns.\nThus, governing the state was integrity,\nusing the military was strategy.\nYet even this is insufficient to take the world—\nthe world is a sacred vessel, not to be acted upon.\nThose who act upon it fail;\nthose who grasp it lose it.\nOnly those who embody the Dao,\nvast and unoccupied,\nthough they do not take the world,\nthe world naturally turns to them.\n\nHow do I know this is so?\nBy this:\nThe more prohibitions in the world, the poorer the people.\nWhen rulers multiply prohibitions,\nthe conditions below fail to reach above,\nand the people grow poor and desperate.\nThe more sharp tools the people possess, the more the state darkens—\nsharp tools are schemes and stratagems.\nWhen the ruler is enlightened,\nthey ensure the people remain without cunning or desire.\nWhen the people abound in schemes,\ntheir superiors grow dim and confused.\n\nThe more clever techniques and rare objects arise,\nthe more people abandon fundamental work\nand pursue frivolous skills,\ngiving rise to useless novelties.\nThe more laws and decrees are promulgated,\nthe more thieves and bandits appear—\nfearing human deceit,\nrulers multiply laws to overcome it.\nYet when the people have nowhere to place their hands,\nthey daily turn to theft and banditry.\n\nThus, the sage says:\nI practice non-action, and the people transform themselves;\nI cherish stillness, and the people rectify themselves;\nI engage in no affairs, and the people enrich themselves;\nI have no desires, and the people return to simplicity.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Eight: The Government’s Obscurity**\nWhen the government is obscure, the people are pure;\nwhen the government is exacting, the people are lacking.\nDisaster!—fortune leans upon it.\nFortune!—disaster lurks within.\nWho knows their ultimate end?\nThere is no fixed standard.\nThe upright reverts to the strange,\nthe good reverts to the ominous.\nThe people’s delusion has lasted long indeed.\n\nThe vastness of heaven and earth\nis obscured by世俗俗见,\nyet they do not know it.\nFortune leans upon disaster,\ndisaster lurks within fortune—\nlike the succession of youth and age, life and death,\nwhich never ceases.\nYet the deluded do not know this.\nOnly the sage,\ntranscending the myriad things\nand grasping their beginning and end,\nattains their wholeness while overlooking minor distinctions.\nThey appear obscure, as if without clarity,\nyet the people are pure, each preserving their nature.\n\nThe世人, not knowing the Dao’s wholeness,\ntake their limited knowledge as supreme.\nThey consider themselves fortunate,\nunaware of disaster lurking behind;\nthey consider themselves good,\nunaware of ominous forces arising within.\nPursuing exactness as clarity,\nthey severely harm things yet fail to recognize their error—\nhow lamentable!\n\nThus, the sage is square but does not cut,\nis sharp but does not wound,\nis straight but not unrestrained,\nis bright but does not dazzle.\nKnowing that minor distinctions cannot encompass things,\nthough capable of squareness, sharpness, straightness, and brightness,\nthey do not employ these abilities,\nfearing to fall into partiality and fail to return.\nThis is what the世俗俗 call obscurity.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Nine: Governing People and Serving Heaven**\nIn governing people and serving heaven,\nnothing surpasses frugality.\nOnly frugality is called \"early compliance.\"\nEarly compliance is called \"accumulating virtue.\"\nAccumulating virtue, nothing is unconquerable;\nnothing unconquerable—none know its limit.\nNone know its limit, thus one can possess the state.\nPossessing the state’s mother, one can endure long.\n\nAll things:\nsquare cuts,\nsharp wounds,\nstraight stretches,\nbright dazzles.\nOnly the sage is square but does not cut,\nsharp but does not wound,\nstraight but not unrestrained,\nbright but does not dazzle—\nthis is called frugality.\nFrugality means possessing but not using.\nThe世俗 lament having nothing to subdue others,\nbut if one truly possesses and can be frugal,\nthough never contending with things,\nthings know they cannot surpass—\nthus, they are subdued early.\n\nOnce subdued, one withdraws and conceals,\nusing it only to the end of life without testing it—\nthus, virtue is deeply accumulated.\nVirtue accumulated to such depth,\nthough the world’s rigidity cannot be overcome,\nnone can fathom its measure.\nOnly then can one possess the state.\nThose世俗小人 who wield minor power\nand use it lightly,\nonce tested and found wanting,\nthe world measures their depth and challenges them.\nThough they wish to preserve their state, it cannot be done.\nThis is how I know frugality can possess the state—\npossessing the state, one possesses its mother.\n\nThis is called \"deepening the root and firming the stem,\nthe Way of long life and enduring vision.\"\nMencius said: \"Preserve the heart-mind, nurture the nature—\nthis is how one serves heaven.\"\nGoverning people with frugality can possess the state—\nthis is it.\nServing heaven with frugality deepens the root and firms the stem—\nthis is it.\nThe sages of old preserved the constancy of their nature and life,\nnot depleting the internal with the external—\nthus, their roots ran deep and could not be uprooted,\ntheir stems were firm and could not be detached.\nThough long life and enduring vision may follow,\ngoverning people and serving heaven,\nthough differing in internal and external,\nshare the same principle—nothing surpasses frugality.\n\n**Chapter 60: Governing a Great State**\nGoverning a great state is like cooking a small fish.\nWhen cooking a small fish, one must not stir;\nwhen governing a great state, one must not disturb.\nDisturbance wearies the people;\nstirring spoils the fish.\n\nApproach the world with the Dao,\nand its *gui* spirits will not be numinous.\nThe sage practices non-action,\nallowing people to rest in their natural state.\nExternally, nothing disturbs them;\ninternally, nothing frightens them—\nthus, nothing can invade.\nThough the *gui* spirits have no use for their numinosity,\nit is not that their *gui* spirits are not numinous,\nbut that their numinosity does not harm people.\nIt is not that their numinosity does not harm people,\nbut that the sage also does not harm people.\nIt is not that their *gui* spirits are not numinous,\nbut that they possess numinosity without harming people.\nIt is not that their numinosity does not harm people,\nbut that the sage has never harmed people—\nthus, their *gui* spirits have no power to act.\nWhen the two do not harm one another,\nvirtue and power converge and return.\n\n**Chapter 61: The Great State as Low Current**\nThe great state is the lower current—\nthe world’s convergence with the great state\nis like many waters flowing toward the low.\nThe world’s intercourse is the world’s female.\nThe female always overcomes the male with stillness,\nusing stillness as her lower position.\nThe many movements rushing toward stillness\nare like springs from on high flowing downward.\n\nThus, when a great state lowers itself before a small state,\nit wins the small state;\nwhen a small state lowers itself before a great state,\nit wins the great state.\nThe great state lowers itself to win people;\nthe small state lowers itself to be received by people.\nBoth obtain what they desire—\nthe greater should take the lower position.\n\n**Chapter 62: The Dao as the Mystery of Myriad Things**\nThe Dao is the mystery of myriad things,\nthe treasure of the good,\nthe refuge of the not-good.\nFine words can win esteem;\nnoble conduct can elevate people.\nWhy discard those who are not good?\n\nAll things manifest externally are but their gateways and halls—\nthe Dao within them is like their inner chamber.\nAll things possess it, yet people do not see it.\nThe worthy obtain and hold it—\nthus, it is called \"the treasure of the good.\"\nThe foolish, though unable to hold it,\ncannot be at peace without it—\nthus, it is called \"the refuge of the not-good.\"\n\nIf one truly has fine words,\nthey can be traded for esteem in the world;\nif one practices noble conduct,\nit can be added to others.\nThough one was unjust in the morning,\nby evening, having heard the great Dao,\ndelusions vanish and nature is restored—\neven if one sought to point out the not-good,\nit could not be found.\nHow then could it be discarded?\n\nThus, in establishing the Son of Heaven and appointing the Three Dukes,\nthough one may precede with large jades and lead with teams of four horses,\nit is not as good as sitting and presenting this Dao.\nIn establishing the Son of Heaven and appointing the Three Dukes,\nthe aim is to save people with the Dao.\nThough large jades are precious and fine horses excellent,\npresenting them is not as beneficial as presenting this Dao.\n\nWhy was this Dao valued in ancient times?\nDid it not say: \"Seek and you will obtain;\nhave faults and you will be spared\"?\nThus, it is honored by the world.\n\nThe Dao is originally within us—\nthe trouble is that people do not seek it.\nSeek it, and you will obtain it.\nThe Dao bears no merit or fault—\nthe trouble is that people do not know it.\nKnow it, and no fault can stain you.\n\n**Chapter 63: Acting Without Acting**\nAct without acting,\nundertake without undertaking,\ntaste without tasting.\nTreat the great as small, the many as few;\nrepay resentment with virtue.\n\nThe sage acts without acting,\nthus nothing is left undone.\nUndertakes without undertaking,\nthus nothing is left unaccomplished.\nTastes without tasting,\nthus nothing is left untasted.\nIn dealing with the great, small, many, and few,\nhe meets them all with the Dao alone.\n\nWhat people cannot forget is resentment—\nyet when love and aversion are forgotten,\neven repaying resentment becomes repaying virtue.\n\nResolve difficulties while they are easy;\naccomplish the great while it is small.\nThe world’s difficult tasks must begin with the easy;\nthe world’s great tasks must begin with the small.\nThus, the sage never attempts the great\nand so accomplishes greatness.\nOne who makes light promises will lack trust;\none who treats many things as easy will encounter many difficulties.\nThus, the sage treats even the difficult as difficult—\nand so never encounters difficulty.\n\nPeople all fear the great and slight the small,\ndread the difficult and belittle the easy.\nWhen they wait until things are difficult before planning,\nor until they are great before acting,\nmatters will always fail.\nThe sage equalizes great and small, many and few—\nnothing is not feared, nothing is not difficult,\nyet how could anything fail to succeed?\n\n**Chapter 64: What Is at Rest Is Easily Held**\nWhat is at rest is easily held;\nwhat has not yet shown signs is easily planned.\nWhat is fragile is easily broken;\nwhat is minute is easily scattered.\nAct before it exists;\ngovern before it becomes disordered.\n\nWhen it does not yet exist,\nholding and planning it is sufficient.\nWhen it is about to arise,\ndissolving and scattering it will not remove it—\nyet this is still better than after it has formed.\nThus, acting before it exists is best;\ngoverning before it becomes disordered is next.\n\nA tree of arm-spanning girth grows from a tiny sprout;\na nine-story terrace rises from a basket of earth;\na journey of a thousand *li* begins beneath the feet.\nThose who act will fail;\nthose who grasp will lose.\nThe sage acts without acting, thus does not fail;\ngrasps without grasping, thus does not lose.\n\nThe coming of order and disorder, fortune and misfortune\nall resemble those three: accumulating the small to become great.\nThe sage awaits them with non-action,\nguards them with non-grasping—\nthus, fortune arises of itself,\nmisfortune vanishes of itself.\nFor example, plant seedlings, plow deeply, and mound the earth thickly—\nby autumn, they will be lush.\nFor example, sit in danger as if facing a thief and watch intently—\nthe thief will retreat of his own accord.\n\nPeople do not understand the spontaneity of things,\nthinking nothing is accomplished without acting,\nnothing retained without grasping—\nthus, they constantly contend with misfortune for victory,\ncompete with fortune for growth.\nThis is why misfortune reaches the point of being irredeemable,\nfortune reaches the point of being unfulfilled—\nsuch is its principle.\n\nPeople in their undertakings often fail when nearly complete.\nBe as cautious at the end as at the beginning,\nand there will be no failed tasks.\nThe sage knows the harm of acting,\nso does not rely on human aid to assist heaven.\nFrom beginning to end, he follows the natural—\nthus, nothing is left unaccomplished.\n\nPeople’s hearts dwell on gain and loss—\neven in minor matters, they do not know to let things be natural.\nWhen they see something nearly complete and fear losing it,\nthere is none who does not consider it a failure.\nThus, it is said: \"Be as cautious at the end as at the beginning,\nand there will be no failed tasks.\"\n\nThus, the sage desires not to desire,\ndoes not value rare goods;\nlearns not to learn,\nreturns to what the multitude has passed by—\nto assist the self-so of the myriad things\nwithout daring to act.\n\nPeople all follow their desires and harm things,\ntrust their learning and injure principle.\nThe sage is not without desire—\nhe desires not to desire,\nthus though he desires, he does not harm things.\nHe is not without learning—\nhe learns not to learn,\nthus though he learns, he does not injure principle.\nThen, inwardly and outwardly empty and bright,\nvast and without acting,\nhe can assist the self-so of the myriad things\nand await their self-completion.\n\n**Chapter 65: Those Skilled in the Dao of Old**\n\nThose skilled in the Dao of old\ndid not enlighten the people but sought to make them simple.\nThe people are hard to govern because of their cleverness.\nThus, to govern the state with cleverness is the state’s bane.\nNot to govern the state with cleverness is the state’s blessing.\nTo know these two is also a model.\nConstantly knowing the model—\nthis is called \"mysterious virtue.\"\nMysterious virtue is deep and far-reaching,\nopposite to things,\nyet leads to great compliance.\n\nWhat I value is virtue;\nwhat things value is cleverness.\nVirtue and cleverness are fundamentally opposed,\nyet what cleverness complies with is small,\nwhile what virtue complies with is great.\n\n**Chapter 66: The King of the Hundred Valleys**\n\nThe reason rivers and seas can be kings of the hundred valleys\nis because they excel in lowliness.\nThus, they can be kings of the hundred valleys.\nTherefore, if the sage wishes to be above the people,\nhe must speak as though below them.\nIf he wishes to lead the people,\nhe must place himself behind them.\nThus, though the sage stands above, the people do not feel burdened;\nthough he stands ahead, the people do not feel harmed.\nThus, the world delights in exalting him without tiring.\nBecause he does not contend,\nno one in the world can contend with him.\n\n**Chapter 67: The World Calls Me Great**\n\nThe world calls me great, yet I seem unworthy.\nPrecisely because I am great, I seem unworthy.\nIf I were worthy, I would have long since been small.\n\nThe Dao is vast, formless, nameless,\npervading the myriad things yet resembling none—\nthis is why it is great.\nIf it resembled things, it would be but one thing among them—\nhow could it be great?\n\nI possess three treasures, which I hold and cherish:\nthe first is compassion,\nthe second is frugality,\nthe third is not daring to be first in the world.\n\nThe Dao takes non-resemblance to things as its greatness,\nthus when it moves as virtue,\nit is obscure, dull, retreating, and unaligned with the world.\nNow, the world values bravery, expansiveness, and aggressive advancement,\nwhile what I cherish—\ncompassion, restraint, frugality, humility, and retreat—\nare all things the world deems unworthy.\n\nCompassion, therefore, can become courage.\nThe world deems decisive bravery worthy and compassionate restraint inadequate,\nnot knowing that decisive bravery is easily thwarted,\nwhile compassionate restraint cannot be overcome in the end—\nit must lead to courage.\n\nFrugality, therefore, can become expansiveness.\nThe world deems vastness and abundance worthy and frugal restraint base,\nnot knowing that vastness is easily exhausted,\nwhile frugal restraint is easily fulfilled—\nit must lead to expansiveness.\n\nNot daring to be first in the world, therefore, can become the completion of leadership.\nThe world deems aggressive advancement capable and not daring to be first shameful,\nnot knowing that aggressive advancement incurs much resentment,\nwhile not daring to be first is willingly exalted by the world—\nit must ultimately become the completion of leadership.\nFor when uncarved wood is dispersed and becomes vessels,\nthe sage employs them as officials and leaders.\nFrom uncarved wood to vessels, there begins to be subordination and leadership.\n\nNow, to abandon compassion and seek bravery,\nto abandon frugality and seek expansiveness,\nto abandon the rear and seek the front—\nis death.\nBravery, expansiveness, and being first—\nthese three are what people universally detest.\nTo be detested by the multitude is to constantly approach death.\n\nCompassion in battle brings victory;\nin defense, it brings firmness.\nHeaven will save such a one, protecting him with compassion.\nWith compassion, one protects things,\nand things love him as parents.\nThough they would die for him without hesitation,\nhe can thus engage in battle and defense.\nHeaven, wishing to save this person,\nopens his heart and will,\nmaking him compassionate toward all.\nBeing compassionate toward all,\nall things will protect him.\n\n**Chapter 68: The Skilled Warrior**\n\nThe skilled warrior is not martial.\nThe warrior’s foundation should be martial,\nbut his conduct should be cautious.\nIf he conducts himself with martiality, he will die.\n\nThe skilled fighter is not angry.\nThe sage fights only when unavoidable.\nIf he fights out of anger, it is for his own sake that he kills—\nheaven will bring calamity upon him.\n\nThe skilled victor over enemies does not contend.\nBecause I do not contend, I can overcome their contention.\nIf both sides contend, victory is not assured.\n\nThe skilled employer of people acts with humility.\nPeople all have the desire to be above others,\nthus none can employ one another.\nIf one can truly act with humility,\nthe world will all be at his service.\nThis is called the virtue of non-contention,\nthe power of employing people’s strength,\nthe alignment with heaven—\nthe ultimate of old.\n\n**Chapter 69: The Use of Arms**\n\nThere is a saying in the use of arms:\n\"I dare not act as host but act as guest.\nI dare not advance an inch but retreat a foot.\"\nTo advance is to have intent to contend;\nto retreat is to have no intent to contend.\nThis is called \"marching without marching,\"\n\"raising arms without arms,\"\n\"engaging the enemy without an enemy,\"\n\"wielding weapons without weapons.\"\nIf one has no intent to contend,\nthough in the midst of armies, it is as if there were no arms to raise,\nno enemy to engage, no weapons to wield—\nhow could there be fault in the use of arms?\n\nThe greatest calamity is to underestimate the enemy.\nUnderestimating the enemy nearly costs me my treasure.\nThus, when evenly matched armies meet,\nthe one with sorrow prevails.\n\n**Chapter 70: My Words Are Easy to Know**\n\nMy words are very easy to know, very easy to practice,\nyet none in the world can know them, none can practice them.\nThe Dao’s greatness restores nature to sufficiency,\nand the subtlety of nature is seen in rising, dwelling, eating, and drinking.\nThe sage points to this to show people—\nis it not easy to know?\nIf one can embody this to respond to things—\nis it not easy to practice?\nYet the world constantly suffers from daily use without knowing.\nKnowing is already difficult—\nhow much more so practicing?\n\nWords have their source; affairs have their lord.\nIt is precisely because of ignorance that they do not know me.\nWords are the snare of the Dao;\naffairs are the tracks of the Dao.\nIf the Dao could be fully expressed in words,\nhearing words would suffice.\nIf it could be fully seen in affairs,\nexamining affairs would suffice.\nBut since words cannot exhaust it and affairs cannot reveal it,\none cannot but seek its source beyond words\nand its lord beyond affairs.\nFor the sages of old, without thought or action,\nthere remained a profound, natural, unselfconscious presence—\nthis is beyond the reach of thought.\nThus, in the end, none know me.\n\nThose who know me are few—thus I am noble. What the multitude can know is not worthy of esteem. Therefore the sage wears coarse cloth while holding jade within. Outwardly, the sage is the same as others; inwardly, he alone is different.\n\n**Chapter 71: Knowing the Unknown**\nTo know the unknown is supreme; to not know the known is a flaw. The Dao cannot be reached by thought, and thus cannot be known. Yet when one has not yet known, without knowing there is no way to enter. Once one has known and clings to knowledge, this is the flaw. Thus, to know yet not know is supreme; to not know yet know is a flaw. Only by recognizing the flaw as a flaw can one be without flaw. Since one cannot but not know, yet cannot know, only by knowing that knowledge is a flaw can the flaw eventually fade. The sage is without flaw because he recognizes the flaw as a flaw—thus he is without flaw.\n\n**Chapter 72: The People Do Not Fear Authority**\nWhen the people do not fear authority, great authority arrives. Human nature inherently possesses authority—lofty, luminous, vast, and resplendent—nothing can surpass it. This is what is called great authority. People are constantly troubled by drowning in delusions, fearing life and death, and dreading gain and loss. The authority of the myriad things rides upon them, leaving no respite for anxiety throughout their lives. Though great authority exists, they do not recognize it. If one truly knows it, life and death are equal, gain and loss are level—nothing inspires fear. Then great authority shines forth before them.\n\nDo not constrict their dwelling; do not weary their life. Only by not wearying can one avoid weariness. The greatness of human nature can embrace heaven and earth. Those who do not know this take their four limbs and nine orifices as themselves. Clinging to them without weariness, their vision does not extend beyond sight, their hearing does not extend beyond sound—they are utterly confined. Thus the teaching says: Do not constrict their dwelling. Those who know this recognize the vastness of human nature and the narrowness of their own life. They are dismayed, desiring escape but unable, knowing the ways in which weariness and longing are shaped by things. Thus the teaching says: Do not weary their life. Only the sage is neither constricted nor wearied. He lives in common with others yet dwells in the Dao, without distinction between broad or narrow, pure or defiled. Only after not wearying of life does one know that life is without weariness.\n\nThus the sage knows himself but does not display himself; loves himself but does not esteem himself. Therefore he discards that and embraces this. Though the sage knows himself, he does not display himself; though he loves himself, he does not esteem himself, fearing that others will develop weariness and longing. If the mind of weariness and longing is not forgotten, there is still fear. Only when fear departs does great authority arrive.\n\n**Chapter 73: Boldness in Daring**\nBoldness in daring leads to death; boldness in not daring leads to life. These two may bring benefit or harm. Who knows the reason for heaven’s aversion? Thus even the sage finds it difficult.\n\nBoldness in daring leads to death; boldness in not daring leads to life—this is the constant principle of things. Yet the daring sometimes survive, and the not daring sometimes perish. The world thus relies on chance and neglects the constant principle. Heaven’s Dao is distant—how can there be such chance? Who knows the origin of its likes and dislikes? Thus even the sage takes the constant as correct and finds boldness difficult. *Liezi* says: \"To divine heavenly intent and weigh profit and harm is not as good as ceasing.\" This is the difficulty of knowing heaven’s Dao—thus it is repeatedly expounded.\n\nHeaven’s Dao does not contend yet excels in victory. It does not contend with things in the moment but ensures ultimate triumph. It does not speak yet excels in response. What does heaven say? The four seasons proceed, the hundred things are born—nothing is sought that does not respond. It does not summon yet comes of itself. The spirit’s arrival cannot be measured—how much less can it be compelled? Who summons it?\n\nVast and unhurried, it excels in planning. Vast and leisurely, as if without aim, yet its calculations surpass human understanding. Heaven’s net is vast and wide, sparse yet never failing. The world observes heaven through the ears and eyes, seeing only a fragment and not the whole. Those who do good and meet misfortune, or do evil and meet fortune, inevitably doubt that heaven’s net is sparse and often fails. Only by grasping its beginning and end, exhausting its transformations, can one know its vastness and breadth—though sparse, it never fails.\n\n**Chapter 74: The People Do Not Fear Death**\nIf the people do not fear death, how can death be used to frighten them? When governance is oppressive and punishments severe, the people have nowhere to place their hands and feet, and thus do not fear death. Even if death is used to frighten them, it is of no use.\n\nIf the people always feared death, and those who acted strangely could be seized and killed, who would dare? When the people are at ease with governance, delight in life, and fear death, then seizing and killing those who are devious and disrupt the multitude—who would dare not submit? There is always one who presides over killing. The one who presides over killing is heaven. When the world is well-governed and devious, disruptive people act wantonly, they are heaven’s outcasts. If I kill them, it is heaven killing them, not I.\n\nTo kill in place of the one who presides over killing is to take the place of the great carpenter in hewing. Those who take the place of the great carpenter in hewing rarely avoid injuring their hands. To kill when it is not heaven’s killing is to kill in place of the one who presides over killing. Taking the place of the great carpenter leads to injured hands; killing in place of the one who presides over killing leads to harm to oneself.\n\n**Chapter 75: The People’s Hunger**\nThe people’s hunger is due to their superiors consuming too many taxes—thus they are hungry. The people are difficult to govern because their superiors act with excessive effort—thus they are difficult to govern. Superiors use effort to guide the people, and the people respond with effort—thus affairs multiply and become difficult to govern.\n\nThe people disregard death because they seek excessive means to sustain life—thus they disregard death. Superiors place profit and desire before the people, and the people compete to enrich their lives—thus they seek profit even unto death without weariness. Only one who does not treat life as something to be done is more worthy than one who esteems life. The extreme of esteeming life must lead to disregarding death. Only one who does not treat life as something to be done preserves life naturally.\n\n**Chapter 76: Human Life**\nWhen humans are alive, they are soft and weak; when dead, they are hard and strong. All things, plants and trees, when alive are soft and fragile; when dead, they are withered and dry. Thus the hard and strong are followers of death; the soft and weak are followers of life.\n\nWhen the qi of harmony is present, the body is free from the affliction of hardness and strength. When the principle of the utmost is present, affairs are free from the burden of hardness and strength. Thus when armies are strong, they do not prevail. Armies that prevail through righteousness are not truly strong. Those that are strong yet unrighteous will swiftly be defeated.\n\nWhen trees are strong, they are felled. Trees that reach the size of a man’s embrace are inevitably cut down. The strong and great occupy the lower position; the soft and weak occupy the higher. This is the constant principle of things. The refined is above, the coarse below—the refined must be soft and weak, the coarse must be strong and great.\n\n**Chapter 77: The Way of Heaven**\n\nThe Way of Heaven—is it not like the drawing of a bow?\nWhen the bow is drawn, the upper string slackens while the lower string tightens.\nThus, the Way of Heaven lowers the high and raises the low.\nIt diminishes the excessive and supplements the deficient.\nThe Way of Heaven diminishes excess to replenish deficiency,\nbut the way of man is not so:\nit diminishes the deficient to serve the excessive.\nWho can take from their excess to offer to the world?\nOnly one who embodies the Dao.\nThe one who embodies the Dao enriches the myriad things yet does not refuse.\nHaving acted for others, they possess even more;\nhaving given to others, they abound all the more.\nNone but the one who embodies the Dao can endure this.\nThus the sage acts yet does not claim,\nachieves yet does not dwell.\nDo they not wish to display their worth?\nTo act and claim, to achieve and dwell—\nthis is to display worth in the world.\nDisplaying worth in the world is to take from excess for one’s own provision.\n\n**Chapter 78: The Soft and Weak Under Heaven**\n\nUnder heaven, nothing is softer or weaker than water,\nyet in attacking the hard and strong, nothing surpasses it—\nnothing can replace it.\nThe weak overcomes the strong; the soft overcomes the hard.\nUnder heaven, none do not know this, yet none can practice it.\nThus the sage says:\n“One who bears the disgrace of the state is called the lord of the altars of soil and grain;\none who bears the misfortune of the state is called the king of all under heaven.”\nUpright words seem reversed.\nUpright words accord with the Dao yet contradict custom,\nfor custom deems bearing disgrace a humiliation\nand bearing misfortune a calamity.\n\n**Chapter 79: Harmonizing Great Resentment**\n\nIn harmonizing great resentment, residual resentment must remain—\nhow can this be deemed good?\nResentment arises from delusion, and delusion emerges from human nature.\nOne who understands nature does not perceive delusion—\nhow then could resentment arise?\nYet today, not knowing to eliminate the root,\nthey seek to harmonize the branches.\nThus, though outwardly harmonized, inwardly it is not forgotten.\nTherefore the sage holds the left tally yet does not demand from others.\nOne with virtue oversees the tally;\none without virtue enforces exactions.\nThe tally’s division into left and right serves as trust and ends strife.\nThe sage shares with others this same nature.\nYet people, taking delusion as constant,\nrush about in the arena of contention,\nunaware that nature has never been the slightest bit deluded.\nThus the sage reveals their nature to others,\nenabling them to eliminate delusion and return to nature.\nWhen delusion is exhausted and nature restored,\nnone fail to attain expansive self-possession,\nlike the right tally matching the left—\nno demand is needed, and they submit of themselves.\nThen, though great resentment and grievance remain,\nthey will melt away like ice,\nknowing their root was never truly present—\nwhat need is there for harmonization?\nThose without virtue, seeking to impose uniformity upon all,\nlabor in vain.\n*彻* means \"to expropriate.\"\n\nThe Way of Heaven shows no partiality—\nit constantly bestows upon the good.\nThe Way of Heaven is impartial—\nonly the good person aligns with it,\nfor the tally is without partiality.\n\n**Chapter 80: A Small State with Few People**\n\nA small state with few people—\nLaozi lived in the declining Zhou, when culture had triumphed over custom, and so he sought to remedy it with non-action. Thus, at the end of his book, he expressed his aspiration: to obtain a small state with few people to test his teachings, though this could not be realized.\n\nLet there be tools for ten or a hundred men, yet unused.\nWhen people each abide in their proper place,\neven those with modest talents will not seek employment in the world.\nTools for ten or a hundred men—these are talents sufficient to lead ten or a hundred men.\n\nLet the people value life and not wander far.\nThough there be boats and carriages, none will ride them;\nthough there be armor and weapons, none will display them.\nLet the people return to knotting cords for record-keeping.\nAffairs are few, and the people simple—\nthough knotted cords suffice.\n\nLet them find their food sweet, their clothing fine,\ntheir dwellings secure, their customs joyful.\nInternally content, they will desire nothing beyond.\nThus, they take what they possess as beauty,\nwhat they dwell in as joy,\nand seek no more.\n\nNeighboring states may gaze upon one another,\nthe sounds of their chickens and dogs heard across the border,\nyet the people will grow old and die without ever traveling between them.\nThough the things of the world are abundant,\nthey will make no demands upon one another—\nfor each is self-sufficient.\n\n**Chapter 81: Truthful Words Are Not Fine**\n\nTruthful words are not fine;\nfine words are not truthful.\nTruth is substance alone—thus it need not be fine.\nBeauty is mere appearance—thus it need not be truthful.\n\nThe good do not dispute;\nthe disputatious are not good.\nOne who takes goodness as their foundation does not seek dispute;\none who takes dispute as their foundation is not necessarily good.\n\nThe wise are not broadly learned;\nthe broadly learned are not wise.\nOne who is guided by the One has no need for broad learning.\nThose who accumulate learning day by day do not necessarily grasp the Dao.\n\nThe sage does not hoard:\nhaving acted for others, they possess more;\nhaving given to others, they have more.\nThe sage embraces the One and nothing else—\nthey accumulate nothing beyond.\nYet when they employ their abilities for others,\nwhen they extend what they possess to others,\npeople’s capacities are finite, while the One is inexhaustible.\nOnly then is the value of the One known.\n\nThe Way of Heaven benefits and does no harm;\nthe Way of the sage acts and does not contend.\nPower that can benefit others can also harm them;\nstrength sufficient to act is sufficient to contend.\nYet though capable of harm, they never harm;\nthough capable of contention, they never contend.\nThis is how Heaven and the sage surpass others\nand become the foundation of all things.\n\nThese are the broad outlines of Laozi’s book\nand the essence of his Dao.\nThus, at the end of the text, he restates them.\n\n**Postscript to the *Laozi Daodejing***\n\nIn my forty-second year, I was demoted and resided in Yunzhou.\nThough Yun was a small prefecture, it abounded in ancient Chan monasteries,\nwhere wandering monks from all directions gathered.\nThere was Daoquan, who dwelled on Huangbo Mountain—\na descendant of Master Nangong.\n\nThe master’s conduct was lofty, his mind penetrating; delighted to follow me in study, he often discussed the Dao with me. He said to me, “What you discuss, I have already found in the Confucian books.” Daoquan replied, “This is the Buddha-dharma.” I said, “Not so. I have humbly heard that the Dao is what Confucians lack. Why insist on falsely claiming it as theirs? Yet if it truly exists among them, the world does not know it. The separation between Confucianism and Buddhism is like that between Hu and Han—they do not understand each other. How then do you know it?”\n\nDaoquan said, “Try to explain its outline for me.” I replied, “The grandson of Confucius, Zisi, wrote the *Zhongyong*. The *Zhongyong* says: ‘Before joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure arise, it is called the Center; when they arise and all hit the mark, it is called Harmony. The Center is the great root of the world; Harmony is the universal Dao. When the Center and Harmony are fully realized, Heaven and Earth take their places, and the ten thousand things are nurtured.’ Is this not the Buddha-dharma? The difference lies only in the source of the words.”\n\nDaoquan said, “How do you explain it?” I replied, “The Sixth Patriarch said: ‘Do not think of good, do not think of evil. At this very moment, what is your original face?’ Since the time of the Sixth Patriarch, more than half of those who have awakened have done so through these words. What is called ‘not thinking of good, not thinking of evil’ is the state before joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure arise. The Center is another name for Buddha-nature, and Harmony is the general term for the Six Perfections and the ten thousand practices. Fully realizing the Center and Harmony, Heaven, Earth, and the ten thousand things arise within them—what else could this be but the Buddha-dharma?”\n\nDaoquan, astonished and delighted, said, “I never knew this before. From now on, I see that Confucianism and Buddhism are one Dharma.” I smiled and said, “Not so. There are indeed not two Ways in the world, but the means of governing people differ. Between ruler and minister, father and son, if there is no ritual and law, there is chaos. Knowing ritual and law but not the Dao, one is merely a vulgar Confucian, not worthy of esteem. Dwelling in the mountains, eating wild plants, drinking from streams, yet holding the supreme Dao in the heart—one may become a teacher of humans and gods. But to govern the world, only the ancient sages, who embodied the Dao in their hearts and did not destroy the law, were fit for the task.”\n\nDaoquan bowed and said, “This is the ultimate teaching.” At that time, I was just interpreting the *Laozi*. Each time I completed a chapter, I would show it to Daoquan, who would sigh and say, “It is all the Buddha’s teaching.” I lived in Yunzhou for five years before returning north. Not long after, Daoquan passed away. Now, more than twenty years have passed. In my interpretations of the *Laozi*, I have occasionally made revisions, and there has never been a case where it did not align with the Buddha-dharma. With no one to discuss this with, I long to see Daoquan again and show him these words. Thus, I write this at the end of the *Laozi*.\n\n**Dated the tenth day of the twelfth month, second year of Daguan (1108), by Ziyou.**\n\n---\n\nWhen I was previously exiled to Haikang, I encountered my elder brother Zizhan in Tengzhou, and we spent over ten days together, discussing our lifelong studies. Zizhan said of my works, “Your *Poetry Commentary*, *Spring and Autumn Annals Commentary*, and *Ancient History*—all surpass what the ancients achieved. Only your interpretation of the *Laozi* seems somewhat lacking.” When I arrived in Haikang, with nothing to occupy me, I revised many of my writings. I then copied out the *Laozi* again and sent it to Zizhan. After this, I was graciously allowed to return north. Zizhan fell ill in Piling and passed away. More than ten years have now passed, and I still do not know whether this book met with his approval.\n\nIn the first year of Zhenghe (1111), in winter, I received from my nephew Mai and others a compilation of my late father’s manuscripts. Among them was one that read: “Yesterday, Ziyou sent his new interpretation of the *Laozi*. I read it without finishing the scroll, set it down, and sighed. Had this book existed in the Warring States period, there would have been no Shang Yang or Han Fei. Had it existed in the early Han, Confucianism and Daoism would have been one. Had it existed between the Jin and Song dynasties, Buddhism and Daoism would not have been two. I never expected, in my old age, to see such an extraordinary work—this must have been what Zizhan had in mind.” After living in Yingchuan for ten years, I have made many revisions to these four books, for the words of a sage cannot be fully understood in a single reading. Thus, whenever I gained new insight, I dared not consider my previous explanations definitive. Today, as I grow older, I believe I have reached a sufficient understanding.\n\nI wished to discuss this again with Zizhan, but it is no longer possible. Mentioning this brings me to tears.\n\n**Dated the eleventh day of the twelfth month, by Ziyou.**\n\n**End of the *Laozi* Commentary, Volume Three.**",

      "translated_text": "The *Imperially Commissioned Complete Library of the Four Treasuries*\nSection: Masters, Volume 14\n*Explications of the Laozi*\nCategory: Daoist Works\nDescriptive Summary\n\n[We, your] ministers respectfully observe: The *Explications of the Daodejing* in two fascicles was composed by Su Zhe of the Song. Master Su’s learning originally moved between the two teachings [of Daoism and Buddhism], and thus his mastery of both was particularly profound, while his elucidations of them also sufficed to fully expound his own doctrines. This work fundamentally asserts that Buddhism and Daoism share a common source, and moreover, it draws upon the *Doctrine of the Mean* to draw parallels. Su Shi, in his postscript, remarked that had this book existed in the early Han, Confucianism and Daoism would have been unified; had it existed in the Jin and Song dynasties, Buddhism and Daoism would have been nondual. Master Zhu [Xi], however, criticized it for blending Confucianism with Mohism in his *Distinctions of Miscellaneous Learning* as a caution. Yet the texts of the two teachings often covertly appropriate Confucian principles while altering their interpretations. Those who expound the classics and clarify the Way as Confucians must not fail to distinguish the finest distinctions, dissecting points of doubt and resemblance to prevent scholars from straying onto divergent paths. If one engages in the learning of the two teachings and annotates their scriptures, one speaks for the two teachings, not for Confucianism.\n\nThe book itself does not escape the tendency to blend Confucianism with Mohism; how could its annotators not each uphold what they have heard? Thus, from the Confucian perspective, Zhe’s work straddles two paths, while from the Daoist perspective, it still elucidates a single principle. Now that the *Laozi* is preserved to represent one school of thought, Zhe’s work should not be entirely discarded either.\n\nRespectfully submitted after collation in the tenth month of the fortieth year of the Qianlong reign.\nGeneral Compilers:\nMinister Ji Yun\nMinister Lu Xixiong\nMinister Sun Shiyi",

      "translated_text": "**General Collators:**\nMinister Lu Feichi\n\n**Imperially Commissioned Complete Library of the Four Treasuries**\n*Laozi Explained, Volume One*\nBy Su Zhe of the Song Dynasty\n\n**Daoist Scripture**\n\n**Chapter One: \"The Dao That Can Be Spoken\"**\nThe Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao. All things are of the Dao, yet what can be spoken of the Dao cannot be constant. Only that which cannot be spoken of the Dao may endure. Consider now benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom—these are the Dao that can be spoken. Yet benevolence cannot become righteousness, nor can propriety become wisdom. That which can be spoken of the Dao cannot be constant. Only the unspoken may abide in benevolence as benevolence, in righteousness as righteousness, and so too with propriety and wisdom. These are all inconstant, while the Dao remains unchanging. Thus does the unspeakable endure.\n\n**Chapter Two: \"The Name That Can Be Named\"**\nIf the Dao cannot be spoken, how much less can it be named? All names belong to that which can be spoken. Once a name is established, the distinctions of round and square, crooked and straight, cannot endure. \"Nameless, it is the beginning of Heaven and Earth; named, it is the mother of the myriad things.\" Thus, constantly desireless, one observes its mystery; constantly desiring, one observes its manifestations. From the nameless, form arises to become Heaven and Earth. Once Heaven and Earth are established, names begin. From the named, the myriad things proliferate. Once the myriad things flourish, names cannot be exhaustively recorded. Therefore, the nameless is the essence of the Dao, and the named is its function. The sage embodies the Dao to serve the world, entering into the realm of multiplicity while abiding in the constant void, thereby observing its mystery. Embodying the utmost emptiness while abiding in the constant presence, one observes its manifestations. Yet if one acts upon manifestations without knowing the mystery, one is coarse and lacks spirit. If one lingers in the mystery without knowing its manifestations, one is refined but unchanging.\n\nThese two emerge from the same source yet bear different names; together they are called the Profound. In terms of form, there are indeed the two—being and non-being. How can one know that non-being transforms into being, and being reverts to non-being, without ever ceasing to be one? Though their names differ, their root is the same. To know the unity of the root is to be profound. All things distant and boundless in their extremity are inevitably profound in appearance. Thus does Laozi often employ \"profound\" to signify the ultimate. Profound beyond the profound is the gateway to all mysteries. To speak of the profound is to reach the limit, yet the mind still clings to profundity. Profound beyond the profound is the utmost, beyond which nothing can be added. It is the source from which all mysteries emerge.\n\n**Chapter Two: \"When All the World Knows\"**\nWhen all the world knows beauty as beauty, ugliness arises. When all know goodness as goodness, un-goodness arises. Thus, being and non-being give rise to one another; difficulty and ease complete one another; long and short shape one another; high and low incline toward one another; sound and voice harmonize with one another; before and after follow one another. The world speaks of beauty and ugliness in terms of form and name. What it calls beautiful and good—are these truly beautiful and good? It does not know that being and non-being, difficulty and ease, high and low, sound and voice, before and after, give rise to and supplant one another, none of which is constant. One may consider oneself long, yet upon encountering one longer, one becomes short. One may consider oneself ahead, yet upon being preceded by another, one falls behind. If one follows what is deemed beautiful and trusts in it, one strays far indeed.\n\nThus the sage engages in non-action and practices the teaching without words. When acting, the mind abides in non-action; when teaching, the intent lies in wordlessness. Thus one transcends the measures of long and short, departs from the calculations of before and after, neither beautiful nor ugly, neither good nor un-good. How then can the world comprehend it? The myriad things arise, yet one does not refuse them; they are born, yet one does not possess them; one acts, yet does not rely on them; accomplishments are achieved, yet one does not dwell in them. The myriad things act for me, yet I do not refuse them. I act for their sake, yet do not possess them, do not rely on them. When success is achieved, I do not dwell in it. This is the reward of non-action and wordlessness. The sage does not even know what is beautiful and good—how then could ugliness and un-goodness follow?\n\nOnly by not dwelling does one not depart. The sage dwells in poverty and lowliness without the sorrow of poverty and lowliness; dwells in wealth and nobility without the burdens of wealth and nobility. This is what is meant by \"not dwelling.\" If I do not dwell, how can it depart? This is the utmost of dwelling.\n\n**Chapter Three: \"Not Exalting the Worthy\"**\nNot exalting the worthy prevents the people from contending. Not prizing rare goods prevents the people from stealing. Not displaying what is desirable prevents the heart from being disordered. Thus the sage’s governance empties the heart, fills the belly, weakens the will, and strengthens the bones. Exalting the worthy causes the people to feel shame in their inferiority and leads to contention. Prizing rare goods causes the people to suffer from lack and leads to theft. Displaying what is desirable causes the people to worry over not obtaining it and leads to disorder. Though the world knows these three as sources of trouble and wishes to abolish them, it is deluded.\n\nThe sage acts otherwise. He does not fail to employ the worthy—he simply does not exalt them. He does not discard rare goods—he simply does not prize them. He does not eliminate desire—he simply does not display it.",

      "translated_text": "Thus, when the worthy are employed yet the people do not contend, when rare goods and desirable things are all displayed yet theft, calamity, and disorder do not arise—is this not to empty the heart without harming the fullness of the belly, to weaken the will without harming the strength of the bones?\n\nNow, if one were to exalt the worthy and prize rare goods, displaying what is desirable, then both heart and belly would be filled. If one were to abolish and discard them, then both will and bones would be weakened. When heart and belly are both filled, the people contend; when will and bones are both weak, they have nothing with which to stand.\n\nConstantly cause the people to be without knowledge and without desire, so that those with knowledge dare not act. Do not display these three, and the people will have nothing to admire—calm and without desire, even the wise will have no use for their cunning. Act through non-action, and nothing will be left ungoverned. Follow the natural course of these three without exalting, prizing, or displaying—this is what is called \"acting through non-action.\"\n\n**Chapter Four: The Dao’s Profound Emptiness**\nThe Dao is empty, yet its use is inexhaustible.\nProfound! It seems the ancestor of the myriad things.\nIt blunts their sharpness, unties their tangles,\nharmonizes their light, and merges with their dust.\nDeep and still, it seems ever-present.\nI do not know whose child it is—\nit resembles the ancestor of the gods.\n\nThough the Dao is ever-present, it ultimately cannot be named, yet it cannot be said to be nonexistent. Thus it is said: \"This must precede even the gods.\" If it precedes the gods and is yet prior to them, then nothing precedes it.\n\n**Chapter Five: Heaven and Earth Are Not Benevolent**\nHeaven and earth are not benevolent—\nthey treat the myriad things as straw dogs.\nThe sage is not benevolent—\nhe treats the hundred clans as straw dogs.\nHeaven and earth are impartial, allowing the myriad things to follow their nature.\nThus, things live and die of themselves—\ndeath is not their cruelty, nor life their benevolence.\nIt is like binding straw to make dogs for sacrifice,\nadorning them for the rites—\nwas this done out of love?\nAfter the rites, they are discarded,\ntrampled by passersby—\nwas this done out of hatred?\nIt is simply as it is.\nThe sage’s relation to the people is the same:\nif he does nothing to harm them, the people preserve their nature.\nThough death and life proceed without his intervention,\nhis non-benevolence is itself great benevolence.\n\nThe space between heaven and earth—\nis it not like a bellows?\nEmpty yet inexhaustible,\nthe more it moves, the more it yields.\nTo push it is to have bellows and pipes—\nwith a single motion, the qi reaches everywhere.\nThe ignorant think it the height of ingenuity,\nyet what does the bellows itself do?\nIt is simply empty and inexhaustible,\nthus the more it moves, the more it yields.\nThe beginning of the transformation of the myriad things,\nthe carving of all forms between heaven and earth—\nis it not like this?\n\nMuch speech leads to exhaustion—\nbetter to guard the center.\n\n**Chapter Six: The Valley Spirit Does Not Die**\nThe valley spirit does not die—\nthis is called the mysterious female.\nThe valley is utterly empty yet has form;\nthe valley spirit is empty and without form.\nEmpty and without form, it has no life—\nhow could it have death?\nIt is called the valley spirit to speak of its power,\nthe mysterious female to speak of its function.\nThe female gives birth to the myriad things—\nit is called \"mysterious\" because one sees it give birth\nbut does not see how it gives birth.\n\nThe gate of the mysterious female—\nthis is called the root of heaven and earth.\nThe gate of the mysterious female:\nthe myriad things emerge from it.\nThe root of heaven and earth:\nheaven and earth arise from it.\nContinuous, as if existing,\nits use is never exhausted.\n\n**Chapter Seven: Heaven and Earth Are Everlasting**\nHeaven is everlasting, earth enduring.\nHeaven and earth, though vast, have not escaped form and number—\ntheir longevity is thus limited.\nYet Laozi speaks of them as everlasting,\nfor he refers only to what humans perceive.\nAs for true everlastingness—\nit is what is called \"the beginning of heaven and earth.\"\n\nHeaven and earth endure because they do not live for themselves—\nthus they achieve long life.\nTherefore the sage places himself last and finds himself first,\nsets himself aside and finds himself preserved.\nIs it not because he is selfless\nthat he achieves his own ends?\n\nHeaven and earth give life to things yet do not claim life for themselves,\nstanding beyond the myriad things—thus they endure.\nThe sage places himself after others yet is foremost,\nsets himself apart yet benefits others,\nstanding beyond the crowd—thus he is first and preserved.\nIf heaven and earth competed with things for life,\nif the sage contended with people for gain,\nthen heaven and earth would be but one thing among many,\nthe sage but one person among others—\nhow could they surpass them?\nThough their selflessness is not a means to achieve private ends,\nprivate ends are thereby achieved—\nthis is the natural course of the Dao.\n\n**Chapter Eight: The Highest Good Is Like Water**\nThe highest good is like water.\nWater benefits the myriad things without contending,\ndwelling in places the multitudes despise—\nthus it is close to the Dao.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* says: \"The alternation of yin and yang is called the Dao.\nWhat continues it is good; what completes it is nature.\"\nIt also says: \"Heaven uses the One to give birth to water.\"\nThe Dao moves and becomes good, just as qi moves and gives birth to water.\nThus it is said: \"The highest good is like water.\"\nBoth begin from nothing and take form—\ntheir principles are the same.\nThe Dao is present everywhere, benefiting all without exception—\nand water is the same.\nYet once bound to form, it differs from the Dao.\nThus it is said: \"close to the Dao.\"\nYet it can be named good—\nnothing surpasses it.\nThus it is called \"the highest good.\"\n\nDwelling in good earth,\nthe heart in good depth,\ngiving with good benevolence,\nspeaking with good sincerity,\ngoverning with good order,\nhandling affairs with good ability,\nacting with good timing—\navoiding the high, flowing to the low,\nnever opposing—this is good earth.\nEmpty, still, and unfathomably deep—this is good depth.\nBenefiting and nourishing the myriad things,\ngiving without seeking repayment—this is good benevolence.\nRound it turns, square it bends,\nblocked it stops, unblocked it flows—this is good sincerity.\nWashing away all filth, leveling high and low—this is good order.\nMeeting things and giving them form without clinging to one—this is good ability.\nFreezing in winter, melting in spring,\ndrying and flooding without losing measure—this is good timing.",

Displaying what is desirable causes the people to worry over not obtaining it and leads to disorder. Though the world knows these three as sources of trouble and wishes to abolish them, it is deluded.\n\nThe sage acts otherwise. He does not fail to employ the worthy—he simply does not exalt them. He does not discard rare goods—he simply does not prize them. He does not eliminate desire—he simply does not display it.",

blame.\n\n**Chapter Nine: Holding and Filling**\n\nHolding and filling—better to cease.\nHoning to a point—cannot long endure.\nKnowing that fullness must overflow yet insisting on holding fast—\nnot as secure as remaining unfilled.\nKnowing that sharpness must break yet striving to hone it first—\none cannot rely on such honing.\nThus the sage possesses yet does not possess—\nhow then could there be fullness?\nFollowing principle before acting—\nhow then could there be sharpness?\nWithout fullness, there is no need to hold.\nWithout sharpness, there is no need to hone.\n\nGold and jade fill the hall—none can guard them.\nWealth and nobility breed arrogance—self-invited calamity.\nSuccess achieved, fame attained—withdraw the self.\nThis is the Dao of Heaven.\nThe sun at its zenith must decline,\nthe moon at its full must wane,\nthe turning of the four seasons—\nthose who achieve must depart.\nHeaven and Earth still abide—\nhow much more so for man?\n\n**Chapter Ten: Carrying Spirit and Soul**\n\nCarrying spirit and soul, embracing the One—\ncan they not be separated?\nWhat distinguishes *po* from *hun*?\n*Po* belongs to the physical, *hun* to the spiritual.\nThe *Yi* says: \"Essence and qi form things; wandering *hun* brings change.\"\nThus we know the nature of spirit and soul:\n*Po* is physical, thus mixed and at rest;\n*hun* is spiritual, thus unified and transforming.\nThis is called \"carrying spirit and soul\"—speaking of their rest.\n\nThe Dao pervades all things;\nin man, it is called *xing* (nature),\nand the marvel of *xing* is spirit.\nSpeaking of its purity before admixture—it is called \"the One.\"\nSpeaking of its gathering before dispersal—it is called \"the uncarved block.\"\nAll return to the Dao, each named according to its reality.\n\nThe sage’s nature is settled, spirit congealed—\nunmoved by external things.\nThough *po* serves as its dwelling,\nwherever spirit desires to go, *po* follows without fail—\nthus spirit ever carries *po*.\nThe common man is enslaved by things, spirit obscured and disordered—\nthus spirit submits to *po*.\nEyes and ears are wearied by sounds and sights,\nnose and mouth labor over scents and flavors.\nWherever *po* desires to go, spirit follows—\nthus *po* ever carries spirit.\n\nTherefore, the teaching is to embrace spirit and carry *po*,\nso the two do not separate.\nThis is indeed the sage’s essential method of cultivating the self.\nAs for the ancients’ \"true persons,\"\nwith deep roots and firm stems,\nlong life and enduring vision—\ntheir Dao likewise arises from this.\n\n**Concentrating qi to attain suppleness—can one be like an infant?**\nWhen spirit is disordered, qi scatters:\nthe strong become belligerent,\nthe weak become fearful—\nunaware of themselves.\nWhen spirit is ordered, qi does not act recklessly;\njoy and anger each follow their proper measure—\nthis is called \"concentrating qi.\"\nThe utmost emptiness of spirit,\nthe beginning of qi’s fullness.\nEmptiness at its extreme is suppleness;\nfullness at its extreme is hardness.\nPure nature without qi—\nthis is called \"attaining suppleness.\"\nThe infant knows neither good nor evil—\nthus its nature is whole.\nNature whole, qi is guarded;\nqi guarded, the body is supple.\nConcentrating qi to attain suppleness—\nthe infant is the utmost.\n\n**Purifying the profound mirror—can one be without flaw?**\nThe sage, externally not carried by *po*,\ninternally not driven by qi—\nthus purifies away all dust and grime.\nThereupon, their spirit is vast and profoundly mirrors all things,\nknowing all arise from nature,\nviewing purity and filth equally—\nwithout blemish.\n\n**Loving the people and governing the state—can one act without contrivance?**\nHaving cultivated the self, one extends the surplus to others.\nThough governing the state and loving the people,\none meets them with a mindless heart.\nIf one acts with intention,\nthen loving the people only harms them,\ngoverning the state only brings disorder.\n\n**The gate of Heaven opens and closes—can one act as the female?**\nThe gate of Heaven is where order and chaos, rise and fall emerge.\nHaving taken the world upon oneself,\namidst its opening and closing, its changing encounters—\nthe common man values gain and fears loss,\nthus rushes ahead to seek fortune.\nThe sage follows principle and knows Heaven’s mandate,\nwaiting for the call before responding.\nThe *Yi* says: \"Preceding Heaven, Heaven does not oppose;\nfollowing Heaven, one accords with the time.\"\nThis is not truly preceding or following—\nrather, one’s before and after always meet Heaven’s mandate.\nOtherwise, the early will be premature, the late will be delayed—\nboth miss the mark.\nThus, \"acting as the female\" means nothing more than not missing the time.\n\n**Understanding the four directions—can one be without knowledge?**\nInternally cultivating the self, externally governing the state—\nfacing change, there is always a Dao.\nIs this not \"understanding the four directions\"?\n\"Understanding the four directions\" is the mind.\nYet this mind knows nothing without ever possessing a knowing mind.\nThe mind is one—\nif there were another that knows,\nthen it would be two.\nFrom one to two—\nthis is the origin of delusion,\nthe beginning of folly.\nNow, the mirror’s response to things—\nonce they come, it reflects them.\nHow could it know the one reflecting?\nOriginally, there is nothing—\nto impose intention upon it is the source of delusion.\n\n**Giving life and nurturing—**\ngiving life yet not possessing,\nacting yet not relying,\ngrowing yet not ruling—\nthis is called \"profound virtue.\"\nIts Dao suffices to give life and nurture the myriad things,\nyet can be without possession, without reliance, without ruling.\nThough possessing great virtue, things do not know it—\nthus it is called \"profound virtue.\"\n\n**Chapter Eleven: The Thirty Spokes**\n\nThirty spokes share one hub—\nwhere there is nothing, lies the use of the cart.\nClay is shaped into vessels—\nwhere there is nothing, lies the use of the vessel.\nDoors and windows are cut to make a room—\nwhere there is nothing, lies the use of the room.\nThus, having gives advantage;\nnothingness gives use.\n\nExhausting wisdom and resources to make tools—\nthe use of tools always lies in nothingness.\nWithout having, nothingness cannot achieve its use;\nwithout nothingness, having cannot apply its advantage.\nThus the sage constantly observes the wondrous in nothingness,\nconstantly observes the subtleties in having.\nKnowing the two as one and indivisible—\nthis is the utmost.\n\n**Chapter Twelve: The Five Colors**\n\nThe five colors blind the eyes.\nThe five tones deafen the ears.\nThe five flavors dull the palate.\nRacing and hunting madden the heart.\nRare goods impede conduct.\nThus the sage is for the belly, not for the eyes—\nhence rejecting that and choosing this.\n\nThe sage sees colors, hears sounds, tastes flavors—\nall the same as others.\nAs for racing and hunting, they have never not engaged in them;\nas for rare goods, they have never not used them.\nYet all consider these harmful, while the sage alone deems them fortunate.\nWhy?\nThe sage is for the belly, the common man for the eyes.\nThe eyes covet yet cannot receive;\nthe belly receives yet never covets.\nThat which comes from without—\nthis is the external thing.\nThat which congeals within—\nthis is the nature’s essence.",

      "translated_text": "Endlessly it flows, nameless—returning to nothingness.\nEndlessly it moves without cease. People see its ceaseless movement and assume it is something, unaware that it ultimately returns to nothing. This is called \"the form of the formless, the image of the imageless\"—what is termed *huhuang*. When it manifests, it takes form; when it guards, it takes image. The form of the formless, the image of the imageless—these are not nothing, yet being and nothingness cannot be named, hence it is called *huhuang*.\n\nMeet it and you do not see its beginning; follow it and you do not see its end.\nThe Dao is everywhere, thus no before or after can be seen.\n\nHold to the ancient Dao to master today’s being.\nTo know the ancient beginning is called the discipline of the Dao. The ancient is the source from which things arise; the present is the current state of things, while the ancient is their origin. Grasping their source, advance and retreat, speed and slowness lie within my control.\n\n**Chapter Fifteen: The Skill of the Ancients**\nThe skillful masters of old were subtle, profound, and penetrating—too deep to be known.\nThey exhausted the coarse and guarded the subtle, reaching the utmost subtlety. Subtlety perfected, they became all-pervading and profoundly unknowable.\n\nOnly because they could not be known were they forced to describe their bearing:\nHesitant, as if crossing a river in winter;\nCautious, as if wary of neighbors on all sides;\nReserved, as if a guest;\nYielding, like ice about to melt;\nSimple, like uncarved wood;\nVast, like a valley;\nTurbid, like muddy water.\n\nWho can still the turbid to gradually clarify it?\nWho can remain at rest to gradually bring forth life?\nThose of the world who drown their nature in things grow turbid and never clear; those who desiccate their nature through stillness grow inert and never live. But knowing that turbidity disturbs nature, one stills it—stilled, it slowly clears. Knowing that extinguishing nature is not the Way, one moves—moved, it slowly lives. As the *Yi* says: \"Still and unmoving, yet responsive, it penetrates all things under heaven.\" What is called \"movement\" here is of the same kind.\n\nThose who preserve this Dao do not desire fullness.\nFullness arises from extremity, leading to turbidity that cannot clear and stillness that cannot live—hence fullness.\nOnly by not being full can one remain worn yet not newly made.\nNo thing does not wear out; only by not being full does its weariness depart without needing renewal.\n\n**Chapter Sixteen: Attaining the Utmost Void**\nAttain the utmost void; guard steadfast stillness.\nIf the void is not utterly attained, something remains; if stillness is not steadfastly guarded, movement lingers. Though mountains and hills are removed, motes of dust remain—this is not the utmost or the steadfast. To attain the void is still to dwell in being; to guard stillness is still to be bound by movement—how much more so for other things? Without the utmost or the steadfast, demanding the function of void and stillness is difficult.\n\nAll things arise together; I observe their return.\nOnly by attaining the utmost void and steadfast stillness can one observe the transformations of the ten thousand things without being disturbed by change, knowing that all arising must return. If I were to arise together with the ten thousand things, I would not be able to know this.\n\nThe ten thousand things flourish, each returning to its root.\nAll things arise from nature and return to nature—like blossoms and leaves growing from the root and returning to it, or waves rising from water and returning to it.\n\nReturning to the root is called stillness.\nIf one cannot naturally return to nature, merely stopping movement and stilling thoughts to seek stillness is not true stillness. Only by returning to the root is there stillness.\n\nThis is called returning to life.\nLife is the mystery of nature. Nature can be spoken of, but when it comes to life, it cannot be spoken.\n\nThe *Yi* says: \"Exhausting principle, fulfilling nature, one reaches life.\" The sage’s study of the Dao must begin with exhausting principle, proceed to fulfilling nature, and culminate in returning to life. Benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and music are how the sage engages with things, yet the function of benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and music must have a source. Those who act without knowing their source are common people; those who know their source and then act are noble ones. This is called exhausting principle. However, one must exert the heart to exhaust principle before attaining it—without seeking, it is not obtained. When things daily confront one, only by seeking can one respond, but this requires effort, and its achievement is slight. Apart from sages, those not obscured by things preserve their nature, which is serene, effortlessly centered, unthinking yet attaining, responsive to things as they come—this is called fulfilling nature. Yet this is still my nature, and as long as there is a distinction between self and things, it verges on delusion.\n\nThe ruler’s decree is called life; Heaven’s decree is called life.\nEngaging with things through nature without knowing it is oneself is why it is entrusted to life.\n\nThis is called returning to life.\nReturning to life is called constancy.\nWhen things arise, even the vastness of heaven and earth, mountains and rivers, is subject to change and impermanence. Only by returning to nature does one abide in serene constancy.\n\nKnowing constancy is called illumination.\nNot taking the return to nature as illumination is merely worldly wisdom—though one may call it illumination, it is not true illumination.\n\nNot knowing constancy, reckless action brings misfortune.\nNot knowing the return to nature, one moves with things—no action is not misfortune. Though one may gain for a moment, the loss is profound.\n\nKnowing constancy, one is capacious.\nWhen deluded by delusion, one is self-righteous and sees others as wrong—all things become enemies. How can one be capacious? But knowing all is delusion, even enemies are met with compassion and pity—what cannot be accommodated?\n\nCapacious, thus impartial.\nWithout exception, all is accommodated, and the feelings of self and others are exhausted—whom would one favor?\n\nImpartial, thus kingly.\nWithout exception, all is impartial—then the world will come and submit.\n\nKingly, thus Heaven.\nWithout exception, all is embraced—what can Heaven add?\n\nHeaven, thus Dao.\nHeaven still has form; the Dao is the utmost. Yet even the Dao cannot advance beyond this.\n\nDao, thus enduring; the body does not perish.\n**Chapter Seventeen: The Highest**\nThe highest ruler—those below know only of his existence.\nGoverning the world through the Dao without ever ruling, the people do not know why things are so—they merely acknowledge his existence.\n\nNext, they draw near and praise him.\nGoverning the world through benevolence and righteousness, his virtue is cherished and his achievements visible, so the people draw near and praise him.

      "translated_text": "Not that sagacity and wisdom are insufficient to grasp the Dao—had sagacity and wisdom governed the world, would there be any who did not □□ things? Yet the people of the age, unable to comprehend the root of sagacity and wisdom, perceive only their branches and take them for skill in overcoming things. Thus they gallop along the branch-streams, and the people begin to suffer harm beyond measure. Therefore, abandon sagacity, discard wisdom, and the people benefit a hundredfold.\n\nAbandon benevolence, discard righteousness, and the people return to filial piety and compassion. Never has there been one who practiced benevolence yet neglected their kin; never has there been one who upheld righteousness yet failed their lord. Benevolence and righteousness are the means by which filial piety and loyalty are realized. Yet when they decline, people usurp the names of benevolence and righteousness to seek profit in the world. Thus sons defy fathers, and fathers abuse sons—this is the work of the traces of benevolence and righteousness. Therefore, abandon benevolence, discard righteousness, and the people return to filial piety and compassion.\n\nAbandon skill, discard profit, and there are no thieves or bandits. Skill is for facilitating tasks; profit is for aiding things. Neither is intended for theft, yet without them, thieves and bandits cannot act. Therefore, abandon skill, discard profit, and there are no thieves or bandits.\n\nThese three are considered cultural refinements, yet they are insufficient—thus they must be assigned to something. Manifest plainness, embrace simplicity, reduce selfishness, diminish desires. The world values these three as remedies for disorder, believing that cultural refinement is insufficient. Some attribute them to sagacity and wisdom, others to benevolence and righteousness, still others to skill and profit—all in an attempt to govern through refinement. Yet the world grows ever more disordered. Why not return to the root?\n\nManifest plainness, embrace simplicity, reduce selfishness, diminish desires, and the world each returns to its nature. Though these three exist, they have no use. Therefore it is said: I practice non-action, and the people transform themselves; I cherish stillness, and the people rectify themselves; I engage in no affairs, and the people enrich themselves; I have no desires, and the people return to simplicity. This is the ultimate of sagacity and wisdom, the perfection of benevolence and righteousness, the pinnacle of skill and profit.\n\nYet Confucius governed the world with benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and music, while Laozi abandoned and discarded them. Some deem their approaches different. The *Yi* says: \"That which is above form is called the Dao; that which is below form is called the instrument.\" Confucius, foreseeing the troubles of later ages, took deep concern. Thus he showed people the instruments while obscuring the Dao, allowing those below the middle to uphold the instruments without being misled by the Dao, thereby avoiding failure in becoming noble persons. Those above the middle, by this means, could ascend to higher understanding.\n\nLaozi acted otherwise. His aim was to clarify the Dao. The Dao cannot be spoken; whatever can be spoken is but its semblance. The enlightened use the false to recognize the true, while the benighted cling to semblances and fall into grave error. Thus in later ages, some have seized upon Laozi’s words to bring chaos to the world, while those who study Confucius commit no great errors. Many have used Laozi’s words to attain the Dao, while those who seek it in Confucius often struggle to find an entry point. The two sages acted out of necessity. Perfection in one aspect inevitably entails neglect in another.\n\n**Chapter Twenty: Abandoning Learning Brings No Sorrow**",

      "translated_text": "**Chapter Twenty: Abandoning Learning Brings No Sorrow**\n\nTo abandon learning is to be without sorrow. Pursuing learning leads to daily accumulation; cultivating the Dao leads to daily reduction. Not knowing the true nature of life and destiny, one seeks to augment through learning, heaping up what one has not yet heard, accumulating without end. Yet without a unifying principle, the round harms the square, the straight harms the curved, and the mind becomes entangled, unable to bear its sorrows. This is the calamity that befalls the learner. Thus it is said: abandon learning, and there is no sorrow.\n\nAs for the sage, though he has never ceased to learn, he takes the Dao as his master. He does not learn and yet lacks nothing; he learns much and yet is not confused. Vast and unburdened, he is without sorrow—why would he need to abandon learning?\n\nBetween \"aye\" and \"nay,\" how great is the distance? Between good and evil, how vast is the difference? When the learner is drowned in what he has heard and lacks a unifying principle, then \"aye\" becomes reverence and \"nay\" becomes contempt—these cannot be spoken of in the same breath. How much more so the opposition between good and evil? Only the sage knows that the myriad things all emerge from the same nature yet are completed in delusion. Like painting horses and oxen, like carving tigers and swine, none are their true forms. When all distinctions of right and wrong, same and different vanish, who can say how great the distance between them truly is? If this is so, then the myriad things grow together without harming one another, and the Dao flows in parallel without conflict—nothing is strange in this.\n\nWhat people fear, one cannot but fear.\n\nThe sage equalizes self and other, unifies same and different, and his mind leaves no residue. Yet how could this mean he neglects the world’s laws, violates social roles, or disrupts principle? What people fear, I too fear; what people do, I too do. Though I stand among the ranks of ruler and minister, father and child, and move within the domains of ritual, music, punishment, and governance, the world does not perceive me as different. What keeps me from being ensnared by things is nothing but the mind.\n\nVast and boundless, it has no end.\n\nPeople all follow what they know, rigidly confined within their narrow paths. The sage traverses both being and non-being, entering all without obstruction—vast and boundless, it cannot be exhausted.\n\nThe multitude bustles and rejoices, as if feasting on a grand sacrifice, as if ascending the terrace in spring. I alone remain still, without sign, like an infant who has not yet learned to smile. People are each drowned in their own preferences, delighting in their pleasures as if feasting on a grand sacrifice, as if ascending the terrace in spring, clamoring to follow them without knowing their error. Only the sage deeply investigates delusion and meets it with stillness, unmoved, like an infant who has not yet learned to smile.\n\nAdrift, as if with no place to return.\n\nRiding the principle of the myriad things without self-interest, he seems to have no place to return.\n\nThe multitude all have more than enough; I alone seem lacking.\n\nThe multitude cling to what they know, each considering themselves full. The sage embraces the myriad things without being bound to one, transcending as if lacking.\n\nIs my mind that of a fool? So muddled!\n\nMuddled as if foolish, yet not foolish.\n\nThe common people are bright; I alone seem dim. The common people are sharp; I alone seem dull.\n\nThe world takes discrimination as wisdom. The sage knows that the delusions of the multitude are not worth distinguishing, so outwardly he seems dim, inwardly he seems dull.\n\nVast like the sea, drifting as if without place to rest.\n\nSuddenly like the sea, its shores unseen, drifting without fixed abode, its resting place unknown.\n\nThe multitude all have their uses; I alone seem stubborn and coarse.\n\nEach has their abilities, so the world can employ them all. The sage’s talents are complete and virtue perfect, as if he has nothing to offer—hence he is suspected of stubbornness and coarseness.\n\nI alone differ from others and value drawing sustenance from the Mother.\n\nThe Dao is the Mother of the myriad things. The multitude pursue things and forget the Dao, while the sage leaves the myriad things behind and takes the Dao as his foundation. Like an infant with no mixed diet, he draws sustenance from the Mother alone.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-One: The Manifestation of Great Virtue**\n\nThe manifestation of great virtue follows only the Dao.\n\nThe Dao is formless. When it moves and becomes virtue, it takes form. Thus virtue is the manifestation of the Dao. Extending this, the forms of all things are the Dao’s manifestation in them.\n\nAs for the Dao as a thing, it is only vague and indistinct. Indistinct, yet within it there are images; vague, yet within it there are things.\n\nThe Dao is neither being nor non-being, so it is described as vague and indistinct. Yet when it reaches its full movement, images take shape and things become manifest—nothing does not emerge from this vagueness and indistinctness.\n\nDark and deep, within it there is essence.\n\nWhen being and non-being are not yet determined, it is vague and indistinct, invisible. At the intersection of being and non-being, its depth and subtlety become apparent. Though form has not yet taken shape, essence resides within it.\n\nIts essence is utterly real; within it there is sincerity.\n\nWhen things take form, truth and falsehood become mixed. But when essence is present, falsehood has no place. Once truth and falsehood are mixed, they divide from one into two, from two into three, branching out in confusion, no longer trustworthy. But when essence is present, it does not deceive me.\n\nFrom ancient times to the present, its name has not departed, by which it surveys the origins of the multitude.\n\nThough ancient and present differ, the Dao does not depart—hence it is named \"not departing.\" Only because it has never departed can it survey the changes of the myriad things. *Fu* means beauty, yet even the beauty of the myriad things cannot escape change.\n\nHow do I know the nature of the origins of the multitude? By this.\n\nThe sage’s knowledge of why the myriad things are as they are comes from embodying the Dao without departing from it.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Two: Yielding Brings Wholeness**\n\nYielding brings wholeness.\n\nThe sage’s every movement follows principle. Where principle lies, whether straight or curved, the essential thing is to achieve passage. Achieving passage, he does not conflict with things; not conflicting, he remains whole.\n\nBending brings straightness.\n\nStraightness that does not follow principle is not true straightness. Following principle, though it may bend, is the ultimate straightness under heaven.\n\nHollow brings fullness.\n\nWhat the multitude gather toward is low. Even if one does not wish to be full, it cannot be avoided.\n\nWorn brings renewal.\n\nBrightness and sharpness are not the Dao. Dullness, as if worn, is the source of daily renewal.\n\nLittle brings attainment.\n\nThe Dao is one alone. Attaining the one, there is nothing unattained.\n\nMuch brings confusion.\n\nMuch learning without a unifying principle brings confusion.\n\nTherefore, the sage embraces the one and becomes the model for the world.\n\nEmbracing the one means returning to one’s nature. For yielding brings wholeness, bending brings straightness, hollow brings fullness, worn brings renewal, little brings attainment, and much brings confusion—all are the results of embracing the one. Thus the chapter concludes with embracing the one.\n\nNot displaying oneself brings clarity.\n\nThe eye does not see itself, so it can see things. The mirror does not illuminate itself, so it can illuminate things. If it were to see or illuminate itself, it would be too occupied with itself to attend to other things.\n\nNot asserting oneself brings distinction.\n\nNot self-promoting brings achievement.\n\nNot boasting brings merit.\n\nNot self-aggrandizing brings longevity.\n\nIt is only because one does not contend that the world cannot contend with him.\n\nNot displaying oneself, not asserting oneself, not self-promoting, not self-aggrandizing—all are aspects of not contending. Thus the chapter concludes with not contending.",

      "translated_text": "The ancients’ saying that \"the crooked is preserved whole\"—was this an empty claim? Truly, wholeness is its return. The world takes straightness as right and crookedness as wrong, yet when one follows principle in the world, one cannot avoid being crooked at times. Thus the chapter concludes by restating: Was this an empty claim? Truly, wholeness is its return. What is called \"wholeness\" is not merely preserving the body; internally, it preserves the body, and externally, it preserves things. Both self and things are preserved, and when one returns to one’s nature, then one’s straightness is great indeed.\n\n**Chapter 23: Few Words, Naturalness**\nFew words are natural. Words that arise naturally are simple and hit the mark; if they are forced and unnatural, they become verbose and hard to believe. Thus it is said: \"The Dao that can be spoken is insipid, invisible, inaudible, and inexhaustible in use\"—this is what is meant by \"few words.\"\n\nWhirlwinds do not last the morning; sudden rains do not last the day. What causes these? Heaven and Earth. Even Heaven and Earth cannot last long—how much less can man? When yin and yang do not contend, wind and rain arrive in due time, neither too swift nor too slow, exhausting their momentum before ceasing. But when yang is excessive above and yin is suppressed below, pent-up and unable to release, this gives rise to whirlwinds and violent rains, as if unable to endure—yet their force cannot last the day. The sages of old spoke sparingly and acted plainly, all following their natural course, thus enduring without exhaustion. The world may grow weary of this, deeming it inferior to clever rhetoric that pleases the ear or strange conduct that astonishes the world, unaware that such things cannot last.\n\nThus, those who engage with the Dao: those who align with the Dao are one with the Dao; those who align with virtue are one with virtue; those who align with loss are one with loss. Those who are one with the Dao—the Dao delights in obtaining them; those who are one with virtue—virtue delights in obtaining them; those who are one with loss—loss delights in obtaining them. Confucius said: \"If one is committed to benevolence, there is nothing to hate.\" If commitment to benevolence is like this, how much more so for commitment to the Dao? If one truly engages with the Dao, then what one does that accords with the Dao obtains the Dao; what accords with virtue obtains virtue. Even if one errs, though the error lies in one’s actions, one must still gain something of the Dao and virtue.\n\nWhen trust is insufficient, there is distrust. Those who do not know the Dao lack firm faith in it; when they err, they doubt it, and thus grow even more distrustful. Only those who know the Dao do not let gains and losses cause them to doubt it.\n\n**Chapter 24: The Unstable Cannot Stand**\nOne who stands on tiptoe cannot stand firm; one who takes long strides cannot walk far. Those who display themselves are not clear; those who assert themselves are not distinguished; those who boast have no merit; those who aggrandize themselves do not endure. No one lacks the ability to stand or walk, yet if one deems standing insufficient and adds tiptoeing, or deems walking insufficient and adds long strides, one will lose one’s ability to stand or walk. Those who display, assert, aggrandize, or boast of themselves are the same. In relation to the Dao, they are called \"leftover food and parasitic growths.\" Just as eating to satiety is enough—excess leads to illness—just as the four limbs are complete—excess is a burden—so too do things sometimes detest such excess. Thus, those who possess the Dao do not dwell in it.\n\n**Chapter 25: The Thing That Is Mixed and Complete**\nThere is a thing mixed and complete, born before Heaven and Earth. The Dao is neither clear nor turbid, neither high nor low, neither coming nor going, neither good nor evil—it is mixed and forms a body. In humans, it is called nature. Thus it is said: \"There is a thing mixed and complete.\" No one knows its origin; it is profoundly constant and abiding, while Heaven and Earth are born within it.\n\nSilent and empty, it stands alone and does not change; it circulates without end and can be the mother of the world. Silent, without sound; empty, without form—it stands alone without peer and never alters. It moves through all things without exhaustion. When it stoops to nurture the myriad things, it is their mother.\n\nI do not know its name; I style it \"Dao,\" and by force call it \"great.\" The Dao is originally nameless. The sage sees that all things proceed from it, so styles it \"Dao\"; sees that nothing surpasses it, so by force calls it \"great.\" Yet in truth, it cannot be named. \"Great\" means passing; passing means far; far means returning. Seeking it from greatness, it passes and departs; seeking it from departure, it is too far to reach. Though it passes and is far, seeking it in return—one’s heart is sufficient.\n\nThus the Dao is great, Heaven is great, Earth is great, and the king is also great. Within the realm, there are four greats, and the king occupies one of them. Humans emulate Earth; Earth emulates Heaven; Heaven emulates the Dao; the Dao emulates spontaneity. From the perspective of the Dao, even Heaven, Earth, and the king are not truly great. Yet the world is accustomed to knowing the greatness of these three and does not believe in the greatness of the Dao. Thus it is stated plainly: Humans are not as great as Earth; Earth is not as great as Heaven; Heaven is not as great as the Dao; the Dao is not as great as spontaneity. Yet if humans could return to their nature for even a day, they would fully encompass these three.\n\n**Chapter 26: Heaviness as the Root of Lightness**\nHeaviness is the root of lightness; stillness is the ruler of restlessness. All things: the light cannot bear the heavy; the small cannot govern the great; the unmoving enables movement; the still controls the restless. Thus lightness takes heaviness as its root; restlessness takes stillness as its ruler. Therefore, the sage travels all day without leaving the heavy supplies. Though there are splendid sights and tranquil dwellings, he moves with transcendent ease, not departing from the heavy supplies. Though the sights are delightful, he must have a tranquil dwelling—so indispensable are heaviness and stillness.\n\nHow can the lord of ten thousand chariots treat his person lightly in the world? The lord’s person bears the world; if he treats it lightly, he is not fit to bear the world. Lightness loses ministers; restlessness loses the ruler. Lightness and restlessness are never fitting. If the ruler is light, ministers know he is not dependable; if ministers are restless, the ruler knows their aims are selfish. Thus it is said: Lightness loses ministers; restlessness loses the ruler.\n\n**Chapter 27: Good Travel Leaves No Tracks**\nGood travel leaves no tracks.",

one returns to the state of infancy.\n\nKnow the white, yet hold to the black—\nbecome the world’s model.\nAs the world’s model, constant virtue never falters,\nand one returns to the boundless.\n\nKnow honor, yet hold to disgrace—\nbecome the world’s hollow.\nAs the world’s hollow, constant virtue is fulfilled,\nand one returns to simplicity.\n\nMale and female, first and last—these reach me.\nWhite and black, light and dark—these reach me.\nHonor and disgrace, noble and base—these reach me.\nAll desire to be first and hate to be last,\nto be bright and hate to be dark,\nto be noble and hate to be base—\nsuch is the nature of things.\n\nYet the reach of first and last is not as pressing as light and dark,\nnor is the reach of light and dark as deep as noble and base.\nThe sages of old cast off delusion to seek the recovery of their nature.\nThe clearer their nature, the lower their guard;\nthe lower their guard, the thicker their virtue;\nthe thicker their virtue, the greater their return.\n\nFor to know and yet not act is not as perfect as\nto know and yet refrain from acting.\nKnow the male, yet hold to the female—\nthis is to know one’s nature.\nWhen one knows nature and stills the heart of contention,\nall who vie to be first in the world will turn to them,\nlike water flowing to a valley, none turning away.\nYet this is like an infant—able to receive but not yet to use.\n\nThus it is said: *Return to the state of infancy.*\nKnow the white, yet hold to the black—\nthis is to see one’s nature.\nDwelling in darkness while gazing upon light,\nnone in the world can escape its form.\nThus, when the many take it as their model,\nthough it responds to the ten thousand things,\nthe model never errs, its use never exhausts.\nThus it is said: *Return to the boundless.*\n\nKnow honor, yet hold to disgrace—\nthis is to recover one’s nature.\nAll delusions extinguished, abiding in disgrace without resentment,\nvast as an empty valley, things come and one responds—\nvirtue is sufficient here, nature pure and unadulterated.\nThus it is said: *Return to simplicity.*\nWhen simplicity is scattered, it becomes vessels;\nthe sage employs it to become a leader of officials.\nThus, great governance does not sever.\n\nThe sage, having returned to simplicity,\nscatters it again to form vessels, responding to the ten thousand things.\nLike a ruler dividing governance to establish officials,\nthis follows the natural course—\nthough it governs, there is no severing.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Nine: Seeking to Grasp the World**\n\nThose who seek to grasp the world and act upon it—\nI see they will not succeed.\nThe sage does not take the world;\nthe ten thousand things turn to them,\nand they cannot but receive it.\nIn governing the world, they do not act upon it,\nbut remove its harms by following the ten thousand things’ natural course.\nIf one seeks to grasp and act upon it, it cannot be attained.\n\nThe world is a sacred vessel—\nit cannot be acted upon.\nThose who act upon it ruin it;\nthose who grasp it lose it.\n\nAll things cannot be acted upon.\nEven a gathering of a hundred people,\nif it does not follow their natural course but acts recklessly,\nwill surely meet with discord and resistance—\nhow much more the world?\nThough small things with few people may be seized by force or cunning,\nwhen it comes to the greatness of the world, with its divine ruler,\nif one does not await its natural turning, there will be rebellion;\nif one does not allow its natural governance, there will be chaos.\n\nThus, things may go forth or follow,\nmay warm or chill,\nmay strengthen or weaken,\nmay bear or destroy.\nTherefore, the sage eliminates excess, extravagance, and extremity.\n\nYin and yang contend, high and low incline,\ngreat and small interact—\nsome go forth ahead, some follow behind,\nsome warm with breath, some chill with wind,\nsome are strengthened by increase, some weakened by decrease,\nsome are borne to completion, some are shattered and destroyed—\nall are the natural course of things, an inescapable tendency.\n\nYet the foolish of the world, acting for private gain and seeking advantage,\nresist and defy it—\ntheir ruin is either overturning or breaking.\nOnly the sage knows it cannot be opposed,\nand so follows it, eliminating excess, extravagance, and extremity,\npreventing it from going too far and harming things,\nso the world remains free of disaster.\nThis is the perfection of non-action.\n\nEven Yao and Tang could not avoid floods and droughts,\nyet they never came to ruin—\nthis is why.\nThe *Yi*’s *Tai* hexagram says:\n*\"The ruler, in accordance with it, regulates the Way of heaven and earth,\nassists the harmony of heaven and earth,\nand thereby aids the people.\"*\nThe three yang lines are within, the three yin lines without—\nthings have reached their utmost flourishing.\nThe sage fears excess will harm life,\nso regulates and assists it, preventing it from going too far.\nThis is what is meant by eliminating excess, extravagance, and extremity.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Thirty: Aiding the Ruler with the Dao**\n\nOne who aids a ruler with the Dao\ndoes not use arms to strengthen the world—\nsuch affairs swiftly return.\nThe sage uses arms only when unavoidable,\nand even then seeks not to overpower the world.\nThough they may prevail, their misfortune will surely return to them.\nKing Ling of Chu, King Min of Qi, the First Emperor of Qin, Emperor Wu of Han—\nsome perished themselves, some brought disaster to their descendants.\nWhat people detest, what spirits abhor—\nnone have escaped this fate.\n\nWhere armies camp, brambles grow;\nafter great wars, years of famine follow.\nWhere arms are present, the people’s affairs are neglected—\nfields go untended.\nAfter war, killing energy prevails—\nthe harvest is damaged.\nThis is true of all warfare,\nhow much more so for those who use arms to overpower?\n\nThe good warrior is resolute, but does not dare to take by force.\nResolute, yet not boastful;\nresolute, yet not vaunting;\nresolute, yet not arrogant;\nresolute, yet only when unavoidable;\nresolute, yet not overbearing.\nBoasting, vaunting, arrogance, and overbearing—\nthese four arise from not being unavoidable.\n\nThings in their prime grow old—\nthis is called not following the Dao.\nWhat does not follow the Dao perishes early.\nAll things are thus:\nonly those who embody the Dao,\nthough complete, seem incomplete,\nthough full, seem empty—\nnever in their prime, thus never growing old,\nnever dying.\n\nTo use arms to overpower the world is to be in one’s prime—\ncan one avoid growing old? Avoid death?\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Thirty-One: Fine Arms**\n\nFine arms are instruments of ill omen—\nsome things detest them.\nTherefore, those who embody the Dao do not dwell with them.",

      "translated_text": "To employ them in rescuing from peril yet not make them a constant practice—\nthis is called \"not dwelling with them.\"\nThe noble person at rest values the left;\nin employing arms, values the right.\nArms are instruments of ill omen,\nnot the instruments of the noble person.\nOnly when unavoidable are they employed;\ntranquility and simplicity are supreme.\nVictory is not deemed beautiful—\nthose who deem it beautiful delight in killing.\nThose who delight in killing cannot realize their will in the world.\n\nAuspicious affairs esteem the left;\ninauspicious affairs esteem the right.\nThe deputy general stands on the left;\nthe supreme general stands on the right—\nthis is to say, in positions of command, they are arrayed as for mourning rites.\nWhen the slain are many, mourn them with sorrowful weeping.\nWhen victorious in battle, observe mourning rites.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Two: The Dao Is Eternally Nameless**\n\nThe Dao is eternally nameless,\nunhewn wood, though small—\nnone in the world dare make it a subject.\nWere lords and kings able to guard it,\nthe myriad things would of themselves submit.\n\nThe nature of unhewn wood is the Dao—\nthe Dao is eternally nameless,\nthus its nature too cannot be named.\nAs a thing, when spread forth, it is present everywhere;\nwhen gathered in, it does not fill even a hair’s tip—\nthis is why, though small, it cannot be made a subject.\nThus, the humble commoner who guards it\nfinds dust, chaff, and husks sufficient to mold Yao and Shun,\nwhile the exalted lord and king who cannot guard it\nsees the myriad things refuse to submit.\n\nHeaven and earth unite to send down sweet dew—\nthe people, without command, of themselves receive it evenly.\n\nThe ascending and descending of the harmonious qi unite as one,\nsending down sweet dew—\nsilently it covers the myriad things, none left uneven.\nThe sage embodies the utmost Dao to respond to all beings,\njust as the dew reaches all without exception—\nthis is how he makes the myriad things submit.\n\nWhen names begin to be established,\nonce names exist, one must also know where to stop.\nKnowing where to stop is how one avoids peril.\nThe sage scatters the unhewn to make vessels,\nusing vessels to establish names—\nhow could he indulge in names and forget the unhewn,\npursue the branch and lose the root?\nHe merely knows to return to nature.\nThus, he rides the myriad things without peril.\n\nThe Dao’s presence in the world\nis like that of streams and valleys to rivers and seas.\n\nRivers and seas are where waters gather;\nstreams and valleys are where waters divide.\nThe Dao is the ancestor of the myriad things;\nthe myriad things are the branches of the Dao.\nAll are water—\nthus streams and valleys return to where they gather;\nall are Dao—\nthus the myriad things submit to their ancestor.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Three: Knowing Others**\n\nKnowing others is wisdom;\nknowing oneself is clarity.\nDiscernment is wisdom;\nfreedom from delusion is clarity.\nThe mind of discernment is not yet free from distinctions,\nthus it reaches only to knowing others and not oneself.\nWhen delusions are exhausted, there are no distinctions—\nthus one can know oneself and then extend to others.\n\nOvercoming others requires force;\novercoming oneself requires strength.\nForce can reach others but not oneself;\nmastering oneself and returning to nature\nis beyond what force can reach—\nthis may be called strength.\n\nOne who knows contentment is rich.\nOne who knows contentment finds sufficiency in whatever befalls—\nthus is never not rich.\nThough possessing the world,\nif one clings to a heart of insufficiency,\nthis is to remain poor for a lifetime.\n\nOne who practices perseverance has resolve.\nNot contending with things yet unceasingly strengthening oneself—\nnothing can wrest away one’s resolve.\n\nOne who does not lose their place endures.\nThough things change endlessly,\nthe heart never loses its ground—\nthus endures.\n\nOne who dies yet does not perish is long-lived.\nThe change of death and life is great,\nyet one’s nature remains serene and undying—\nthis is how the ancients’ utmost persons neither live nor die.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Four: The Great Dao Spreads**\n\nThe great Dao spreads—\nhow it may be left or right!\n\nSpreading, it is without limitation, without exclusion—\nthus it reaches everywhere, above and below, in all directions.\nThe myriad things rely on it to live, yet it does not refuse;\nits work complete, it does not claim possession.\n\nIt nurtures and sustains the myriad things yet does not act as master—\nit may be named as small.\nThe myriad things return to it yet it does not act as master—\nit may be named as great.\nThus, the sage never deems himself great,\nand so accomplishes his greatness.\nIf one is great yet harbors the mind of greatness,\none becomes small.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Five: Holding the Great Image**\n\nHold the great image—\nthe world will come.\nThe Dao is neither being nor non-being,\nthus it is called the great image.\nWere it manifestly formed,\nit would have likenesses and differences—\nlikenesses would attract, differences repel.\nAttraction would bring them, repulsion would drive them away—\nthis would not suffice to make the world come.\n\nComing yet unharmed,\npeaceful, at ease, secure.\nWhere there are attractions and aversions,\nthere are benefits and harms.\nWhen attractions and aversions are exhausted,\nthen toward the myriad things there is no harm—\nthus the kingly person is without disquiet, without disturbance, without peril.\n\nMusic and bait may halt passing travelers—\nthe Dao’s utterance is bland, without flavor,\nseen yet not sufficient to behold,\nheard yet not sufficient to listen to,\nused yet inexhaustible.\n\nSetting out music and bait to await comers—\nare these not sufficient to halt passing travelers?\nYet when the music ends and the bait is consumed,\nthey will abandon them and depart.\nAs for holding the great image to await the world—\nthe world does not know to love it,\nhow much less could it be hated?\nThough without scent, flavor, form, or sound to please,\nits use is inexhaustible.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Six: Subtle Clarity**\n\nTo contract it, first expand it;\nto weaken it, first strengthen it;\nto abolish it, first exalt it;\nto take it, first give it—\nthis is called subtle clarity.\n\nHad one never given yet suddenly taken,\nthe momentum would not be fully extended,\nthe principle would not be sufficient—\nmomentum not fully extended, taking would be difficult;\nprinciple not sufficient, things would not submit.\nYet this verges on employing cunning—\nwhat difference is there from Guan Zhong or Sun Wu?\nThe sage’s path and the vulgar’s traces\nmay indeed appear similar.\nThe sage rides principle,\nwhile the vulgar employ cunning—\nriding principle is like medicine, skillfully responding to illness;\nemploying cunning is like merchants, skillfully seeking profit.\n\nSoftness and weakness overcome hardness and strength.\nThe sage knows hardness and strength are not to be relied upon,\nthus abides in softness and weakness.\nThe world’s hardness and strength vie and clash,\nwhile I alone remain soft and weak, awaiting them.\nWhen the great are wounded and the small perish,\nI sit unmoving, awaiting their exhaustion—\nthis is called overcoming.\nThough the sage does not intentionally do this to overcome things—\nknowing the natural course of events,\nhe dwells in their spontaneity.\n\nFish cannot be removed from the depths;\nthe state’s sharp instruments cannot be shown to others.\n\nThe fish’s advantage lies not in claws or teeth to overcome things—\nwhile it abides in the deep abyss,\neven the strong and forceful cannot seize it.\nOnce removed from the depths to dry land,\nit is but a helpless creature—what can it do?\nThe sage dwells in softness and weakness,\nand the hard and strong cannot harm him—\nnot only cannot harm him,\nbut will in the end be controlled by him.\nIs this not the state’s sharp instrument?\nFish are only controlled once removed from the depths;\nthe sage, abiding in softness and weakness without weariness,\nthus ultimately subdues the world—\nhow could this be shared with the common crowd?",

      "translated_text": "**Imperially Commissioned Complete Library of the Four Treasuries**\n*Laozi Jie, Scroll Two*\n*Composed by Su Zhe of the Song*\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Eight: \"The Highest Virtue Does Not Act as Virtue\"**\n\nThe highest virtue does not act as virtue—thus it possesses virtue.\nThe lesser virtue does not lose virtue—thus it has no virtue.\nThe sage follows the heart’s desires without overstepping the mark,\nnot by deliberate intent at virtue, yet virtue is naturally sufficient.\nThose below, knowing virtue’s worth, strive to preserve it,\nbut this is merely self-completion—what virtue is there in that?\n\nThe highest virtue acts without acting and without purpose;\nthe lesser virtue acts with purpose.\nTo act without purpose yet still harbor purpose is still to act.\nOnly acting without acting and without purpose can be called true non-action.\nThose below cannot accomplish without acting,\nyet even in their action, purpose remains—\nthey are not those who act blindly without method.\n\nThe highest benevolence acts without purpose;\nthe highest righteousness acts with purpose.\nBoth benevolence and righteousness cannot escape action,\nbut their distinction lies in this:\nbenevolence excels by acting without purpose,\nwhile righteousness achieves merit by acting with purpose.\n\nVirtue has high and low, yet benevolence and righteousness have only high and no low—why?\nBecause lesser virtue lies between benevolence and righteousness,\nand what is below even righteousness is not worth mentioning.\n\nThe highest ritual acts, yet none respond—\nthen it rolls up its sleeves and forces compliance.\nFrom virtue downward to ritual,\nthe sage’s means of ordering the people reach their limit.\nThus, when ritual is enacted and none respond,\nit resorts to force;\nwhen force meets no response,\npunishments arise and weapons are drawn—\nthen it is mere action without method.\n\nTherefore:\nLose the Dao, and virtue follows;\nlose virtue, and benevolence follows;\nlose benevolence, and righteousness follows;\nlose righteousness, and ritual follows.\nRitual is the thinning of loyalty and trust, the harbinger of chaos.\nWhere loyalty and trust exist without ritual,\nloyalty and trust remain unseen.\nWhen ritual is established,\nthe beauty of loyalty and trust shines forth externally—\nbetween ruler and minister, father and son,\nhusband and wife, friends—\noutwardly resplendent, yet inwardly hollow.\nThus, to follow it is order; to oppose it is chaos.\nThe distance between order and chaos is thinner than a hair’s breadth—\nhence it is called the harbinger of chaos.\n\n\"Foreknowledge\" is the flower of the Dao, the beginning of folly.\nThe sage surveys the myriad things,\ntheir rights and wrongs, gains and losses,\nall laid bare as in a mirror’s reflection—\nnothing escapes its sight.\nWhat, then, is \"before\" or \"after\"?\nThe common people’s vision is limited to the eye,\ntheir hearing to the ear,\ntheir thoughts to the heart,\ntheir defenses to the realm of things.\nThey exhaust their intellect to seek understanding,\nand when they chance upon some insight,\nthey deem themselves enlightened,\nunaware that this is the very beginning of folly.\n\nThus, the great man dwells in thickness, not thinness;\nin substance, not ornament.\nTherefore, he discards that and embraces this.\nThe world’s petty men delight in their small gains below\nand forget what is above—\nthey favor thinness and neglect thickness,\npluck flowers and discard fruit.\nWho but the great man can discard that and embrace this?\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Nine: \"Those of Old Who Attained the One\"**\n\nThose of old who attained the One:\nHeaven attained the One and became clear;\nEarth attained the One and became tranquil;\nthe spirits attained the One and became numinous;\nthe valleys attained the One and became full;\nthe myriad things attained the One and came to life;\nthe lords and kings attained the One and became the standard for all under heaven.\n\nThe One is the Dao.\nAll things that become things do so through the Dao.\nThe people of the world see things and forget the Dao.\nThey know only that heaven is clear,\nearth is tranquil,\nspirits are numinous,\nvalleys are full,\nthe myriad things come to life,\nand lords and kings are the standard for all under heaven—\nyet they do not know that what enables them to attain these\nis simply the presence of the Dao.\n\nTheir attainment of the One is the same.\nWithout clarity, heaven would fear splitting;\nwithout tranquility, earth would fear bursting;\nwithout numinosity, spirits would fear fading;\nwithout fullness, valleys would fear exhaustion;\nwithout life, the myriad things would fear annihilation;\nwithout the standard, lords and kings, though noble and high, would fear collapse.\n\n\"Attainment\" speaks of the extreme.\nHeaven not attaining the One does not immediately split,\nearth not attaining the One does not immediately burst,\nspirits not attaining the One do not immediately fade,\nthe myriad things not attaining the One do not immediately perish,\nlords and kings not attaining the One do not immediately collapse—\nyet in the extreme, this is where they must arrive.\n\nThus, the noble takes the humble as its root,\nthe high takes the low as its foundation.\nThe vastness of heaven and earth,\nthe nobility of lords and kings—\nall arise from the attainment of the One.\nYet what, after all, is the One?\nInvisible to the eye, intangible to the grasp—\nit is the most subtle of heaven and earth,\nwhat we call humble and low.\n\nThus, lords and kings call themselves \"orphaned,\" \"widowed,\" \"unworthy\"—\nis this not taking the humble as their root?\nThose who used these titles in the past\nmerely grasped the root and forgot the branch.\n\nThus, to assemble the parts of a carriage is not to make a carriage.\nDo not desire it to be lustrous like jade or coarse like stone.\nWheels, spokes, canopy, axle, crossbar, yoke, hub, linchpin—\neach part can be counted,\nyet the carriage itself cannot be counted.\nOnly then do we know that \"nothing\" is what makes the carriage—\nthis is what is meant by \"nothing’s use as use.\"\n\nThen do heaven and earth become heaven and earth through greatness?\nDo lords and kings become lords and kings through nobility?\nWithin greatness and nobility, the One resides—\nthis is what makes them heaven and earth, lords and kings,\nyet none know it.\n\nThus, the One dwells in nobility yet is not noble,\ndwells in humility yet is not humble—\nnot like jade, lustrous yet unable to be humble,\nor stone, coarse yet unable to be noble.\n\n**Chapter Forty: \"Reversion Is the Movement of the Dao\"**\n\nReversion is the movement of the Dao.\nReturning to one’s nature is stillness,\nyet in its quiescent non-action,\nwhen stimulated, it penetrates all things under heaven—\nthis is the origin of movement.\n\nWeakness is the function of the Dao.\nThe Dao is formless and soundless—\nnothing under heaven is weaker than the Dao,\nyet nothing under heaven is stronger.\nThis is how it can function for the myriad things.\n\nHeaven and earth and the myriad things are born of being;\nbeing is born of non-being.\n\nThe world does not know that stillness is movement,\nweakness is strength—\nthus it is told of the origin of things.\nFor all things under heaven,\nwe hear of the mother controlling the child,\nbut never of the child controlling the mother.\n\n**Chapter Forty-One: \"When the Highest Scholars Hear of the Dao\"**\n\nWhen the highest scholars hear of the Dao, they diligently practice it.\nWhen middling scholars hear of the Dao, they half-believe, half-doubt it.\nWhen the lowest scholars hear of the Dao, they laugh loudly at it.\nIf it were not laughed at, it would not be the Dao.\n\nThe Dao is formless, invisible,\nsoundless, inaudible.\nWithout first knowing the falsity of the myriad things,\nwithout the vastness of emptiness or the clarity of insight,\none cannot help but disbelieve.\nThus, the lowest scholars hear of the Dao and deem it absurd, fantastical—\nand laugh at it.\nThe middling scholars hear of the Dao and waver,\nappearing and disappearing, doubting it.\nOnly those who see it clearly\nthen practice it diligently, embracing it without slack.\n\nConfucius said:\n\"To speak to him without weariness—was it not Yan Hui?\"\nThis is what is meant by the highest scholars.",
      "overlap_context": " the nameless uncarved block,\nperhaps they may yet be halted.\n\nThe nameless uncarved block itself desires nothing;\nthrough non-desire, it quiets the world,\nand the world settles of itself.\n\nThe sage harbors no thought of embracing simplicity within,\nnor leaves any trace of it without—\nthus the uncarved block remains whole and its use vast.\nIf the desire for simplicity still lingers in the heart,\none strays far from it indeed.\n\n*Laozi Jie, Scroll One*\n*(Masters Section, Daoist School, Laozi Jie)*",

      "translated_text": "Thus, those who establish teachings have said:\nTo establish is to set forth what is ancient. Those who set forth teachings in antiquity held such sayings, and Laozi adopted them below—what is expounded here is the same.\n\nThe luminous Dao seems dim,\nilluminating all yet not scrutinizing.\nAdvancing in the Dao seems like retreating,\nas if halting yet not moving—none in the world can surpass its swiftness.\nThe level Dao seems uneven,\nnow smooth, now rough, yet wherever it reaches, all is made level without ever being shaved down.\nSupreme virtue resembles a valley,\nfor supreme virtue does not assert virtue, like a valley’s emptiness.\nGreat whiteness seems sullied—\nif whiteness remains unstained, this belongs to the fastidious, not the sage.\nVast virtue seems insufficient,\nfor when it is so boundless that nothing can be added, it merely stops here—this is not true vastness.\nEstablished virtue seems negligent,\nfor it follows the self-so of things without imposing itself; outwardly it appears indolent, yet in truth it is established.\nTrue substance seems mutable,\nfor one who embodies the sage and embraces the spirit, adapting to things without losing constancy, outwardly appears to change.\nThe great square has no corners,\nfor it preserves its vastness without carving sharp angles.\nThe great vessel is slow to complete,\nfor its greatness cannot be put to immediate use.\nThe great tone is soundless,\nbeyond what the ear can hear.\nThe great image has no form,\nbeyond what the eye can see.\nThe Dao is hidden, without name.\nOnly the Dao is good at bestowing and accomplishing.\n\nThe Dao abides nowhere yet is nowhere absent. All these twelve manifestations appear in things, yet the Dao in its wholeness remains hidden, without name. Only by dwelling where it dwells, extending its surplus to bestow upon what is lacking, do things rely on it to be brought to completion.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Two**\nThe Dao gives birth to the One,\nthe One gives birth to the Two,\nthe Two give birth to the Three,\nthe Three give birth to the myriad things.\nThe myriad things bear yin and embrace yang,\nwith qi harmonizing them in the center.\n\nThe Dao is neither One nor Two, yet when it pairs with things, the Dao is One while things are not. Thus, the Dao is named as One, yet the Dao is not the One. One and One make Two, Two and One make Three—from this onward, the myriad things are born. Though things number in the tens of thousands and differ in form, none fail to bear yin and embrace yang, with qi harmonizing them in the center. This is because things are born from the Three, and the Three are born from the One—such is the natural principle.\n\nWhat people despise are only the orphaned, the widowed, and the unworthy, yet kings and lords use these as their titles. People of the world, not knowing the origin of the myriad things, all scorn the few and small while prizing the many and great. Yet kings and lords, though exalted, call themselves orphaned, widowed, and unworthy—those of ancient understanding had already grasped this.\n\nThus, sometimes diminishing leads to increase, and sometimes increasing leads to diminishment. What others teach, I also teach: “The strong and overbearing do not meet a natural death.” I will take this as the father of all teachings.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Three**\nThe softest in the world gallops through the hardest.\nThat which has no substance enters where there is no gap.\nThrough this, I know the benefit of non-action.\n\nUsing hardness to oppose hardness—if it does not break, it shatters.\nUsing softness to oppose hardness—softness does not wear away, nor does hardness suffer harm.\nSeek this in things, and water is the example.\nUsing what exists to enter what exists—resistance prevents reception.\nUsing what does not exist to enter what exists—what does not exist never wearies, nor is what exists ever aware.\nSeek this in things, and the spirit is the example.\nThus, only the sage, through non-action, can command the many strong and move through all things.\n\nThe teaching without words, the benefit of non-action—few in the world attain these.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Four**\nFame or self—which is dearer?\nSelf or wealth—which is greater?\nTo put self before fame, to value self and scorn wealth—this is still not forgetting the self.\nOne who forgets the self does not possess the self—how much less fame or wealth?\nYet to value the self for the sake of the world, one cannot but forget the self.\nThus, let the world know that fame is not worth cherishing, that wealth is not worth amassing, and only then will they know to value the self. Knowing to value the self, only then will they know to forget the self—this is Laozi’s intent.\n\nGain or loss—which is more harmful?\nNot gaining is taken as harmful, but once gained, the fear of loss is a harm even greater than not gaining. Only by equalizing having and lacking, gain and loss, can one be free from harm.\n\nExcessive love must bring great expense,\nhoarding much must bring heavy loss.\nKnow contentment, and you will not be disgraced;\nknow when to stop, and you will not be imperiled—\nthus can you endure long.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Five**\nGreat perfection seems flawed,\nyet its use is never exhausted.\nGreat fullness seems empty,\nyet its use is never depleted.\nThe world takes non-flawed as perfection, so perfection must have exhaustion.\nIt takes non-empty as fullness, so fullness must have depletion.\nThe sage aims for great perfection yet does not guard against its flaws,\nseeks great fullness yet does not despise its emptiness—\nthus perfection is never exhausted, and fullness is never depleted.\n\nGreat straightness seems bent,\ngreat skill seems clumsy,\ngreat eloquence seems inarticulate.\nStraightness that does not bend will break;\nfollowing principle in action, though crooked, is straight.\nSkill that does not seem clumsy will labor;\nentrusting things to their nature, though clumsy, is skill.\nEloquence that does not seem inarticulate will be exhausted;\nspeaking according to principle, though inarticulate, is eloquence.\n\nRestlessness overcomes cold,\nstillness overcomes heat.\nPurity and tranquility set the world right.\nPerfection without flaw, fullness without emptiness, straightness without bending, skill without clumsiness, eloquence without inarticulateness—these are like restlessness that cannot be still, stillness that cannot be restless. Restlessness can overcome cold but not heat; stillness can overcome heat but not cold. Both are bound to one side and not the mean. Only in serene purity, unstained by any one thing—neither perfect nor flawed, neither full nor empty, neither straight nor bent, neither skillful nor clumsy, neither eloquent nor inarticulate—can one overcome all and serve as the world’s standard.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Six**\nWhen the world follows the Dao,\nwarhorses are retired to fertilize fields.",

knowledge.”*\n\nIn the pursuit of the Dao, one daily diminishes.\nIf for a single day one knows the Dao,\none sees that the ten thousand things are but illusion.\nAbandoning illusion to seek the recovery of nature—\nthis is called diminishing.\nConfucius said to Zigong:\n*“Do you think I am one who learns much and remembers it?”*\n*“Yes, is it not so?”*\n*“No. I unify it with a single thread.”*\n\nDiminish and diminish again,\nuntil one reaches non-action.\nThrough non-action, nothing is left undone.\nTo abandon illusion in pursuit of recovering nature may be called diminishing,\nyet the mind that seeks to abandon illusion still remains.\nOnly when one forgets even this mind,\nwhen nature is pure and nothing is left,\ncan one act without failing in non-action.\n\nTo take the world, one must always act without contrivance;\nthose who contrive cannot take the world.\nAll people have the desire to take the world,\nso they scheme and strive,\ntheir minds manifesting outwardly—\nand things resist them,\nso in the end they cannot succeed.\nThe sage, acting without contrivance, has no schemes;\nhis mind manifests outwardly,\nand things are at peace with him.\nThough he does not seek to take the world,\nthe world comes to him.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Nine**\nThe sage has no fixed mind;\nhe takes the minds of the people as his mind.\nThe good, I treat as good;\nthe not-good, I also treat as good—\nthus virtue is goodness.\nThe trustworthy, I trust;\nthe untrustworthy, I also trust—\nthus virtue is trustworthiness.\n\nVoid and formless,\nhe takes the forms of the ten thousand things as his form.\nIf the void had its own form,\nhow could it shape the ten thousand things?\nThus, the sage has no mind of his own;\nhe takes the minds of the people as his mind.\nWhether good or not-good, he treats all as good;\nwhether trustworthy or not, he treats all as trustworthy.\nGood and not-good lie with them,\nbut my way of treating them as good never changes—\nthis may be called virtuous goodness.\nTrust and distrust lie with them,\nbut my way of trusting never alters—\nthis may be called virtuous trustworthiness.\n\nOtherwise, to favor the good and reject the not-good,\nto trust the trustworthy and reject the untrustworthy—\nhow could this be called *“constantly good at saving people, and so leaving none behind”*?\n\nThe sage in the world is ever cautious,\nfor the world he harmonizes his mind.\nThe people all fix their ears and eyes upon him,\nand the sage treats them all as children.\nThe world’s good and evil, truth and falsehood,\nare each convinced of their own rightness,\nmutually opposing and harming one another,\nuncertain of what to settle upon.\nThe sage, troubled by this,\nis ever cautious for the world,\nharmonizing his mind—\nwithout good or evil, without truth or falsehood,\nhe treats all with unity.\nThey fix their ears and eyes to observe the sage’s judgments,\nbut he meets them all with the simplicity of an infant.\nToward the good, he feels no delight;\ntoward the evil, he feels no resentment.\nThus, the good do not grow proud,\nthe evil do not grow bitter—\nall relax and transform,\nand the world begins to settle.\n\n**Chapter Fifty**\nEmerging from life, entering death—\nnature itself is neither born nor dies.\nTo emerge is to be born; to enter is to die.\nOf those who live, thirteen parts;\nof those who die, thirteen parts;\nof those whose lives lead them to death’s ground, thirteen parts.\n\nThose who use things to extract essence and nourish themselves belong to the living;\nthose who indulge in sound and color, scent and taste, to harm themselves belong to the dead.\nThese two once divided, the way of life and death is set.\nYet I know activity without rest,\nspeech without silence,\nthought without forgetting—\nall hastening toward exhaustion,\nwhich is what is meant by *“those whose lives lead them to death’s ground.”*\nThe way of life and death, spoken of in tens,\nthree parts each—\nis this not nine parts for life and death,\nand one part alone for neither life nor death?\nNeither life nor death—\nthis is what the *Yi* calls *“still and unmoving.”*\nLaozi speaks of the nine but not the one,\nletting people discover it for themselves,\nto glimpse the wonder of thoughtless non-action.\n\nWhy is this so?\nBecause of the thickness of life-generating.\nWhere there is life, there is death—\nthus those who live are also those who die.\nWhen what people rely upon for life is thick,\nthe way of death is ever nine in ten.\n\nI have heard that those skilled in nurturing life,\nwalking on land, do not meet rhinoceros or tiger;\nentering battle, do not avoid armor or weapons.\nThe rhinoceros finds nowhere to thrust its horn,\nthe tiger nowhere to place its claws,\nweapons nowhere to lodge their blades.\nWhy is this so?\nBecause they have no ground for death.\n\nThe sage always dwells in neither life nor death—\nhow could there be ground for death where even life’s ground is absent?\n\n**Chapter Fifty-One**\nThe Dao gives them life,\nvirtue nurtures them,\nthings give them form,\nand circumstances complete them.\nThe Dao is the mother of the ten thousand things—\nthus what gives life to the ten thousand things is the Dao.\nAs it moves and becomes virtue,\nit herds and nourishes the multitude without refusal—\nthus what nurtures the ten thousand things is virtue.\nYet neither Dao nor virtue can shape themselves;\nonly through things do they take form.\nThings cannot complete themselves;\nonly through the interplay of near and far, hard and soft,\naccumulating into circumstances,\ndo the changes of rise and fall, order and chaos, come to completion.",

      "translated_text": "Thus, the ten thousand things all revere the Dao and honor virtue. Though form arises from things and completion from circumstances, without the Dao there is no life, and without virtue there is no nurturance—hence the reverence for the Dao and the honor for virtue. The Dao is revered like father and elder brother, virtue honored like lords and kings, for the Dao has no position while virtue has a name.\n\nThe reverence for the Dao and the honor for virtue arise not by command (or: rank) but always by nature. Those who rely on rank to attain reverence and honor are not truly revered or honored. Therefore, the Dao gives them life, virtue nurtures them, raises them, rears them, completes them, ripens them, nourishes them, and shelters them—giving life yet not possessing, acting yet not relying, raising yet not dominating. This is called profound virtue.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Two**\nThe world has a beginning,\nwhich serves as the world’s mother.\nNameless, it is the beginning of Heaven and Earth;\nnamed, it is the mother of the ten thousand things.\nWhen the Dao is still without name,\nit is that by which things find their beginning.\nWhen it comes to have a name,\nit is that by which things find their life.\nThus it is called the beginning, and also the mother—\nits child is the ten thousand things.\nHaving known (or: attained) the mother,\none proceeds to know the child.\nHaving given life to the child,\none returns to guard the mother—\nthus to the end of life one is not imperiled.\n\nThe sage embodies the Dao to encompass all things,\nlike knowing the child through the mother—\nclear and without anything unexamined.\nThough his wisdom suffices to encompass all,\nhe never allows things to obscure the Dao,\nand so he guards the mother to the end.\nBlock the openings, close the gates—\nthroughout life one does not toil.\nOpen the openings, assist the affairs—\nthroughout life one cannot be saved.\n\nAll under Heaven possess this Dao,\nyet they constantly suffer from forgetting the Dao and following things.\nThe eye delights in color, the ear in sound—\nopening the heart that delights in these\nand using these affairs to assist it,\none sinks throughout life and cannot be saved.\nThe sage’s way of never toiling throughout life\nlies solely in blocking and closing,\nnever going forth to follow them.\n\nSeeing the small is called clarity.\nThe harm of delight begins small but gradually grows.\nKnowing that the small will become great\nand closing it—this is called clarity.\n\nGuarding the soft is called strength.\nPursuing what delights one without reflection,\nthinking oneself strong—this is not true strength.\nOnly one who sees delight and knows to fear it\ncan be called strong.\n\nUse its light, return to its clarity—\nleave no disaster to the self.\nThis is called practicing constancy.\nThe worldly open what delights them\nand give themselves over to things,\ngoing forth without return.\nThe sage blocks and closes,\nnot cutting off from things but responding with spirit,\nusing its light while the self does not engage.\nThe ear’s ability to hear, the eye’s to see,\nthe nose’s to smell, the mouth’s to taste,\nthe body’s to touch, the mind’s to think—\nall are what is called light.\nWhen light meets things, things depart but clarity remains undiminished.\nThus one responds to endless changes without exhaustion,\ndisaster does not reach the self,\nand so one’s constant nature remains serene,\npassed down unbroken.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Three**\nIf I were suddenly to have knowledge\nand walk the great Dao,\nonly the practice of contrivance would I fear.\nThose who embody the Dao have no knowledge, no action,\nno contrivance—yet things transform themselves.\nNow, if one suddenly has knowledge\nand walks the great Dao,\nthere is contrivance and establishment,\nwhich is not natural—\nenough to be feared.\n\nThe great Dao is level and smooth,\nyet the people prefer byways.\nThe great Dao is level and easy, without peril or obstruction,\nbut those in the world who do not know it\nconsider it circuitous and distant,\npreferring byways to seek shortcuts.\nThus all who abandon their nature\nand contrive some practice\nare those who desire speed.\n\nThe courts are well-swept,\nthe fields overgrown with weeds,\nthe granaries empty.\nYet they wear embroidered robes,\ncarry sharp swords,\nsate themselves with food and drink,\nand possess surplus wealth and goods—\nthis is called the boast of thieves.\nIs this not contrary to the Dao?\n\nThe vulgar are bright, I alone seem dim;\nthe vulgar are discerning, I alone seem dull.\nHow could one still adorn the branches and neglect the root,\nmaking contrivance one’s affair,\nboasting to teach thieves?\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Four**\nWhat is well established cannot be uprooted,\nwhat is well embraced cannot be lost—\nthus descendants’ sacrifices never cease.\nHow could there be establishment without uprooting,\nembrace without loss?\nOnly the sage knows the truth of nature\nand the falsity of things,\ndiscarding things to cultivate the self.\nHis virtue is full and substantial—\ntruly, nothing is established, yet his establishment cannot be uprooted;\ntruly, nothing is grasped, yet his embrace cannot be lost.\nThus even to his descendants,\nsacrifices never cease.\n\nCultivate it in the self, and its virtue is genuine;\ncultivate it in the family, and its virtue abounds;\ncultivate it in the village, and its virtue grows long;\ncultivate it in the state, and its virtue becomes abundant;\ncultivate it in the world, and its virtue becomes universal.\nThus, observe the self through the self,\nobserve the family through the family,\nobserve the village through the village,\nobserve the state through the state,\nobserve the world through the world.\nHow do I know the world is thus?\nBy this.\n\nWhat lies beyond Heaven and Earth\nis unseen by the vulgar,\nyet its principle can be inferred.\nThe perfection of cultivating the self—\nobserving the self through the self,\nthe family through the family,\nthe village through the village,\nthe state through the state—\nall lie within what I can know.\nBut how do I know that the sage\nobserves the world through the world\nas I observe the self through the self?\nHow could the self be observed through the self,\nyet the world alone not be observed through the world?\nThus it is said: How do I know the world is thus?\nBy this—meaning, also, by observing it through the self.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Five**\nOne who contains profound virtue\nis like a newborn child.\nLaozi’s words on the Dao and virtue\noften compare them to an infant—\nall speak of its essence, not yet its function.\nThe infant is tranquil, without desire—\nits essence is perfect,\nyet when things come, it does not know how to respond,\nso it cannot yet be called function.\n\nPoisonous insects do not sting,\nfierce beasts do not seize,\nbirds of prey do not strike.\nThe Dao has no form or body—\nhow could things see it,\nlet alone harm it?\nWhat causes humans to have form\nis their having a heart-mind.\nThus, with a heart-mind comes form,\nwith form comes opposition,\nand with opposition comes harm.\nBeings without a heart-mind\nhave nothing to oppose—\nhow could they be harmed?\nThe infant reaches this state\nsolely because it has no heart-mind.\n\nBones weak, sinews soft, yet its grip is firm.\nNot knowing the union of male and female,\nyet its organ stirs—\nits essence is at its fullest.\nWithout grasping, it naturally grips;\nwithout desire, it naturally stirs—\nthus one knows its essence is full,\nnot the heart-mind.\n\nAll day it cries without its throat becoming hoarse—\nits harmony is at its fullest.\nThe heart-mind moves, and qi is harmed;\nqi harmed, crying becomes hoarse.\nAll day crying without hoarseness—\nthus one knows its heart-mind does not move\nand its qi is harmonious.",

things—\nwho then is close or distant?\nThey view opposition and compliance equally—\nwho then benefits or harms?\nUnknowing of glory or shame—\nwho then is honored or disgraced?\nSuch calculations fall short—\nthis is why it is revered by the world.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Seven: Governing the State with Integrity**\nGovern the state with integrity,\nuse the military with strategy,\ntake the world through non-action.\n\nThe sages of old\nwere gentle with the distant and capable with the near,\nwithout intent to use the military.\nOnly when unavoidable did they engage in campaigns.\nThus, governing the state was integrity,\nusing the military was strategy.\nYet even this is insufficient to take the world—\nthe world is a sacred vessel, not to be acted upon.\nThose who act upon it fail;\nthose who grasp it lose it.\nOnly those who embody the Dao,\nvast and unoccupied,\nthough they do not take the world,\nthe world naturally turns to them.\n\nHow do I know this is so?\nBy this:\nThe more prohibitions in the world, the poorer the people.\nWhen rulers multiply prohibitions,\nthe conditions below fail to reach above,\nand the people grow poor and desperate.\nThe more sharp tools the people possess, the more the state darkens—\nsharp tools are schemes and stratagems.\nWhen the ruler is enlightened,\nthey ensure the people remain without cunning or desire.\nWhen the people abound in schemes,\ntheir superiors grow dim and confused.\n\nThe more clever techniques and rare objects arise,\nthe more people abandon fundamental work\nand pursue frivolous skills,\ngiving rise to useless novelties.\nThe more laws and decrees are promulgated,\nthe more thieves and bandits appear—\nfearing human deceit,\nrulers multiply laws to overcome it.\nYet when the people have nowhere to place their hands,\nthey daily turn to theft and banditry.\n\nThus, the sage says:\nI practice non-action, and the people transform themselves;\nI cherish stillness, and the people rectify themselves;\nI engage in no affairs, and the people enrich themselves;\nI have no desires, and the people return to simplicity.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Eight: The Government’s Obscurity**\nWhen the

this.\nOnly the sage,\ntranscending the myriad things\nand grasping their beginning and end,\nattains their wholeness while overlooking minor distinctions.\nThey appear obscure, as if without clarity,\nyet the people are pure, each preserving their nature.\n\nThe世人, not knowing the Dao’s wholeness,\ntake their limited knowledge as supreme.\nThey consider themselves fortunate,\nunaware of disaster lurking behind;\nthey consider themselves good,\nunaware of ominous forces arising within.\nPursuing exactness as clarity,\nthey severely harm things yet fail to recognize their error—\nhow lamentable!\n\nThus, the sage is square but does not cut,\nis sharp but does not wound,\nis straight but not unrestrained,\nis bright but does not dazzle.\nKnowing that minor distinctions cannot encompass things,\nthough capable of squareness, sharpness, straightness, and brightness,\nthey do not employ these abilities,\nfearing to fall into partiality and fail to return.\nThis is what the世俗俗 call obscurity.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Nine: Governing People and Serving Heaven**\nIn governing people and serving heaven,\nnothing surpasses frugality.\nOnly frugality is called \"early

possess the state.\nPossessing the state’s mother, one can endure long.\n\nAll things:\nsquare cuts,\nsharp wounds,\nstraight stretches,\nbright dazzles.\nOnly the sage is square but does not cut,\nsharp but does not wound,\nstraight but not unrestrained,\nbright but does not dazzle—\nthis is called frugality.\nFrugality means possessing but not using.\nThe世俗 lament having nothing to subdue others,\nbut if one truly possesses and can be frugal,\nthough never contending with things,\nthings know they cannot surpass—\nthus, they are subdued early.\n\nOnce subdued, one withdraws and conceals,\nusing it only to the end of life without testing it—\nthus, virtue is deeply accumulated.\nVirtue accumulated to such depth,\nthough the world’s rigidity cannot be overcome,\nnone can fathom its measure.\nOnly then can one possess the state.\nThose世俗小人 who wield minor power\nand use it lightly,\nonce tested and found wanting,\nthe world measures their depth and challenges them.\nThough they wish to preserve their state, it cannot be done.\nThis is how I know frugality can possess the state—\npossessing the state, one possesses its mother.\n\nThis is called \"deepening the root and firming the stem,\nthe Way of long life and enduring vision.\"\nMencius said: \"Preserve the heart-mind, nurture the nature—\nthis is how one serves heaven.\"\nGoverning people with frugality can possess the state—\nthis is it.\nServing heaven with frugality deepens the root and firms the stem—\nthis is it.\nThe sages of old preserved the constancy of their nature and life,\nnot depleting the internal with the external—\nthus, their roots ran deep and could not be uprooted,\ntheir stems were firm and could not be detached.\nThough long life and enduring vision may follow,\ngoverning people and serving heaven,\nthough differing in internal and external,\nshare the same principle—nothing surpasses frugality.",

      "translated_text": "**Chapter 60: Governing a Great State**\nGoverning a great state is like cooking a small fish.\nWhen cooking a small fish, one must not stir;\nwhen governing a great state, one must not disturb.\nDisturbance wearies the people;\nstirring spoils the fish.\n\nApproach the world with the Dao,\nand its *gui* spirits will not be numinous.\nThe sage practices non-action,\nallowing people to rest in their natural state.\nExternally, nothing disturbs them;\ninternally, nothing frightens them—\nthus, nothing can invade.\nThough the *gui* spirits have no use for their numinosity,\nit is not that their *gui* spirits are not numinous,\nbut that their numinosity does not harm people.\nIt is not that their numinosity does not harm people,\nbut that the sage also does not harm people.\nIt is not that their *gui* spirits are not numinous,\nbut that they possess numinosity without harming people.\nIt is not that their numinosity does not harm people,\nbut that the sage has never harmed people—\nthus, their *gui* spirits have no power to act.\nWhen the two do not harm one another,\nvirtue and power converge and return.\n\n**Chapter 61: The Great State as Low Current**\nThe great state is the lower current—\nthe world’s convergence with the great state\nis like many waters flowing toward the low.\nThe world’s intercourse is the world’s female.\nThe female always overcomes the male with stillness,\nusing stillness as her lower position.\nThe many movements rushing toward stillness\nare like springs from on high flowing downward.\n\nThus, when a great state lowers itself before a small state,\nit wins the small state;\nwhen a small state lowers itself before a great state,\nit wins the great state.\nThe great state lowers itself to win people;\nthe small state lowers itself to be received by people.\nBoth obtain what they desire—\nthe greater should take the lower position.\n\n**Chapter 62: The Dao as the Mystery of Myriad Things**\nThe Dao is the mystery of myriad things,\nthe treasure of the good,\nthe refuge of the not-good.\nFine words can win esteem;\nnoble conduct can elevate people.\nWhy discard those who are not good?\n\nAll things manifest externally are but their gateways and halls—\nthe Dao within them is like their inner chamber.\nAll things possess it, yet people do not see it.\nThe worthy obtain and hold it—\nthus, it is called \"the treasure of the good.\"\nThe foolish, though unable to hold it,\ncannot be at peace without it—\nthus, it is called \"the refuge of the not-good.\"\n\nIf one truly has fine words,\nthey can be traded for esteem in the world;\nif one practices noble conduct,\nit can be added to others.\nThough one was unjust in the morning,\nby evening, having heard the great Dao,\ndelusions vanish and nature is restored—\neven if one sought to point out the not-good,\nit could not be found.\nHow then could it be discarded?\n\nThus, in establishing the Son of Heaven and appointing the Three Dukes,\nthough one may precede with large jades and lead with teams of four horses,\nit is not as good as sitting and presenting this Dao.\nIn establishing the Son of Heaven and appointing the Three Dukes,\nthe aim is to save people with the Dao.\nThough large jades are precious and fine horses excellent,\npresenting them is not as beneficial as presenting this Dao.\n\nWhy was this Dao valued in ancient times?\nDid it not say: \"Seek and you will obtain;\nhave faults and you will be spared\"?\nThus, it is honored by the world.\n\nThe Dao is originally within us—\nthe trouble is that people do not seek it.\nSeek it, and you will obtain it.\nThe Dao bears no merit or fault—\nthe trouble is that people do not know it.\nKnow it, and no fault can stain you.\n\n**Chapter 63: Acting Without Acting**\nAct without acting,\nundertake without undertaking,\ntaste without tasting.\nTreat the great as small, the many as few;\nrepay resentment with virtue.\n\nThe sage acts without acting,\nthus nothing is left undone.\nUndertakes without undertaking,\nthus nothing is left unaccomplished.\nTastes without tasting,\nthus nothing is left untasted.\nIn dealing with the great, small, many, and few,\nhe meets them all with the Dao alone.\n\nWhat people cannot forget is resentment—\nyet when love and aversion are forgotten,\neven repaying resentment becomes repaying virtue.\n\nResolve difficulties while they are easy;\naccomplish the great while it is small.\nThe world’s difficult tasks must begin with the easy;\nthe world’s great tasks must begin with the small.\nThus, the sage never attempts the great\nand so accomplishes greatness.\nOne who makes light promises will lack trust;\none who treats many things as easy will encounter many difficulties.\nThus, the sage treats even the difficult as difficult—\nand so never encounters difficulty.\n\nPeople all fear the great and slight the small,\ndread the difficult and belittle the easy.\nWhen they wait until things are difficult before planning,\nor until they are great before acting,\nmatters will always fail.\nThe sage equalizes great and small, many and few—\nnothing is not feared, nothing is not difficult,\nyet how could anything fail to succeed?\n\n**Chapter 64: What Is at Rest Is Easily Held**\nWhat is at rest is easily held;\nwhat has not yet shown signs is easily planned.\nWhat is fragile is easily broken;\nwhat is minute is easily scattered.\nAct before it exists;\ngovern before it becomes disordered.\n\nWhen it does not yet exist,\nholding and planning it is sufficient.\nWhen it is about to arise,\ndissolving and scattering it will not remove it—\nyet this is still better than after it has formed.\nThus, acting before it exists is best;\ngoverning before it becomes disordered is next.\n\nA tree of arm-spanning girth grows from a tiny sprout;\na nine-story terrace rises from a basket of earth;\na journey of a thousand *li* begins beneath the feet.\nThose who act will fail;\nthose who grasp will lose.\nThe sage acts without acting, thus does not fail;\ngrasps without grasping, thus does not lose.\n\nThe coming of order and disorder, fortune and misfortune\nall resemble those three: accumulating the small to become great.\nThe sage awaits them with non-action,\nguards them with non-grasping—\nthus, fortune arises of itself,\nmisfortune vanishes of itself.\nFor example, plant seedlings, plow deeply, and mound the earth thickly—\nby autumn, they will be lush.\nFor example, sit in danger as if facing a thief and watch intently—\nthe thief will retreat of his own accord.\n\nPeople do not understand the spontaneity of things,\nthinking nothing is accomplished without acting,\nnothing retained without grasping—\nthus, they constantly contend with misfortune for victory,\ncompete with fortune for growth.\nThis is why misfortune reaches the point of being irredeemable,\nfortune reaches the point of being unfulfilled—\nsuch is its principle.\n\nPeople in their undertakings often fail when nearly complete.\nBe as cautious at the end as at the beginning,\nand there will be no failed tasks.\nThe sage knows the harm of acting,\nso does not rely on human aid to assist heaven.\nFrom beginning to end, he follows the natural—\nthus, nothing is left unaccomplished.\n\nPeople’s hearts dwell on gain and loss—\neven in minor matters, they do not know to let things be natural.\nWhen they see something nearly complete and fear losing it,\nthere is none who does not consider it a failure.\nThus, it is said: \"Be as cautious at the end as at the beginning,\nand there will be no failed tasks.\"\n\nThus, the sage desires not to desire,\ndoes not value rare goods;\nlearns not to learn,\nreturns to what the multitude has passed by—\nto assist the self-so of the myriad things\nwithout daring to act.\n\nPeople all follow their desires and harm things,\ntrust their learning and injure principle.\nThe sage is not without desire—\nhe desires not to desire,\nthus though he desires, he does not harm things.\nHe is not without learning—\nhe learns not to learn,\nthus though he learns, he does not injure principle.\nThen, inwardly and outwardly empty and bright,\nvast and without acting,\nhe can assist the self-so of the myriad things\nand await their self-completion.",

      "translated_text": "**Chapter 65: Those Skilled in the Dao of Old**\n\nThose skilled in the Dao of old\ndid not enlighten the people but sought to make them simple.\nThe people are hard to govern because of their cleverness.\nThus, to govern the state with cleverness is the state’s bane.\nNot to govern the state with cleverness is the state’s blessing.\nTo know these two is also a model.\nConstantly knowing the model—\nthis is called \"mysterious virtue.\"\nMysterious virtue is deep and far-reaching,\nopposite to things,\nyet leads to great compliance.\n\nWhat I value is virtue;\nwhat things value is cleverness.\nVirtue and cleverness are fundamentally opposed,\nyet what cleverness complies with is small,\nwhile what virtue complies with is great.\n\n**Chapter 66: The King of the Hundred Valleys**\n\nThe reason rivers and seas can be kings of the hundred valleys\nis because they excel in lowliness.\nThus, they can be kings of the hundred valleys.\nTherefore, if the sage wishes to be above the people,\nhe must speak as though below them.\nIf he wishes to lead the people,\nhe must place himself behind them.\nThus, though the sage stands above, the people do not feel burdened;\nthough he stands ahead, the people do not feel harmed.\nThus, the world delights in exalting him without tiring.\nBecause he does not contend,\nno one in the world can contend with him.\n\n**Chapter 67: The World Calls Me Great**\n\nThe world calls me great, yet I seem unworthy.\nPrecisely because I am great, I seem unworthy.\nIf I were worthy, I would have long since been small.\n\nThe Dao is vast, formless, nameless,\npervading the myriad things yet resembling none—\nthis is why it is great.\nIf it resembled things, it would be but one thing among them—\nhow could it be great?\n\nI possess three treasures, which I hold and cherish:\nthe first is compassion,\nthe second is frugality,\nthe third is not daring to be first in the world.\n\nThe Dao takes non-resemblance to things as its greatness,\nthus when it moves as virtue,\nit is obscure, dull, retreating, and unaligned with the world.\nNow, the world values bravery, expansiveness, and aggressive advancement,\nwhile what I cherish—\ncompassion, restraint, frugality, humility, and retreat—\nare all things the world deems unworthy.\n\nCompassion, therefore, can become courage.\nThe world deems decisive bravery worthy and compassionate restraint inadequate,\nnot knowing that decisive bravery is easily thwarted,\nwhile compassionate restraint cannot be overcome in the end—\nit must lead to courage.\n\nFrugality, therefore, can become expansiveness.\nThe world deems vastness and abundance worthy and frugal restraint base,\nnot knowing that vastness is easily exhausted,\nwhile frugal restraint is easily fulfilled—\nit must lead to expansiveness.\n\nNot daring to be first in the world, therefore, can become the completion of leadership.\nThe world deems aggressive advancement capable and not daring to be first shameful,\nnot knowing that aggressive advancement incurs much resentment,\nwhile not daring to be first is willingly exalted by the world—\nit must ultimately become the completion of leadership.\nFor when uncarved wood is dispersed and becomes vessels,\nthe sage employs them as officials and leaders.\nFrom uncarved wood to vessels, there begins to be subordination and leadership.\n\nNow, to abandon compassion and seek bravery,\nto abandon frugality and seek expansiveness,\nto abandon the rear and seek the front—\nis death.\nBravery, expansiveness, and being first—\nthese three are what people universally detest.\nTo be detested by the multitude is to constantly approach death.\n\nCompassion in battle brings victory;\nin defense, it brings firmness.\nHeaven will save such a one, protecting him with compassion.\nWith compassion, one protects things,\nand things love him as parents.\nThough they would die for him without hesitation,\nhe can thus engage in battle and defense.\nHeaven, wishing to save this person,\nopens his heart and will,\nmaking him compassionate toward all.\nBeing compassionate toward all,\nall things will protect him.\n\n**Chapter 68: The Skilled Warrior**\n\nThe skilled warrior is not martial.\nThe warrior’s foundation should be martial,\nbut his conduct should be cautious.\nIf he conducts himself with martiality, he will die.\n\nThe skilled fighter is not angry.\nThe sage fights only when unavoidable.\nIf he fights out of anger, it is for his own sake that he kills—\nheaven will bring calamity upon him.\n\nThe skilled victor over enemies does not contend.\nBecause I do not contend, I can overcome their contention.\nIf both sides contend, victory is not assured.\n\nThe skilled employer of people acts with humility.\nPeople all have the desire to be above others,\nthus none can employ one another.\nIf one can truly act with humility,\nthe world will all be at his service.\nThis is called the virtue of non-contention,\nthe power of employing people’s strength,\nthe alignment with heaven—\nthe ultimate of old.\n\n**Chapter 69: The Use of Arms**\n\nThere is a saying in the use of arms:\n\"I dare not act as host but act as guest.\nI dare not advance an inch but retreat a foot.\"\nTo advance is to have intent to contend;\nto retreat is to have no intent to contend.\nThis is called \"marching without marching,\"\n\"raising arms without arms,\"\n\"engaging the enemy without an enemy,\"\n\"wielding weapons without weapons.\"\nIf one has no intent to contend,\nthough in the midst of armies, it is as if there were no arms to raise,\nno enemy to engage, no weapons to wield—\nhow could there be fault in the use of arms?\n\nThe greatest calamity is to underestimate the enemy.\nUnderestimating the enemy nearly costs me my treasure.\nThus, when evenly matched armies meet,\nthe one with sorrow prevails.\n\n**Chapter 70: My Words Are Easy to Know**\n\nMy words are very easy to know, very easy to practice,\nyet none in the world can know them, none can practice them.\nThe Dao’s greatness restores nature to sufficiency,\nand the subtlety of nature is seen in rising, dwelling, eating, and drinking.\nThe sage points to this to show people—\nis it not easy to know?\nIf one can embody this to respond to things—\nis it not easy to practice?\nYet the world constantly suffers from daily use without knowing.\nKnowing is already difficult—\nhow much more so practicing?\n\nWords have their source; affairs have their lord.\nIt is precisely because of ignorance that they do not know me.\nWords are the snare of the Dao;\naffairs are the tracks of the Dao.\nIf the Dao could be fully expressed in words,\nhearing words would suffice.\nIf it could be fully seen in affairs,\nexamining affairs would suffice.\nBut since words cannot exhaust it and affairs cannot reveal it,\none cannot but seek its source beyond words\nand its lord beyond affairs.\nFor the sages of old, without thought or action,\nthere remained a profound, natural, unselfconscious presence—\nthis is beyond the reach of thought.\nThus, in the end, none know me.",

      "translated_text": "Those who know me are few—thus I am noble. What the multitude can know is not worthy of esteem. Therefore the sage wears coarse cloth while holding jade within. Outwardly, the sage is the same as others; inwardly, he alone is different.\n\n**Chapter 71: Knowing the Unknown**\nTo know the unknown is supreme; to not know the known is a flaw. The Dao cannot be reached by thought, and thus cannot be known. Yet when one has not yet known, without knowing there is no way to enter. Once one has known and clings to knowledge, this is the flaw. Thus, to know yet not know is supreme; to not know yet know is a flaw. Only by recognizing the flaw as a flaw can one be without flaw. Since one cannot but not know, yet cannot know, only by knowing that knowledge is a flaw can the flaw eventually fade. The sage is without flaw because he recognizes the flaw as a flaw—thus he is without flaw.\n\n**Chapter 72: The People Do Not Fear Authority**\nWhen the people do not fear authority, great authority arrives. Human nature inherently possesses authority—lofty, luminous, vast, and resplendent—nothing can surpass it. This is what is called great authority. People are constantly troubled by drowning in delusions, fearing life and death, and dreading gain and loss. The authority of the myriad things rides upon them, leaving no respite for anxiety throughout their lives. Though great authority exists, they do not recognize it. If one truly knows it, life and death are equal, gain and loss are level—nothing inspires fear. Then great authority shines forth before them.\n\nDo not constrict their dwelling; do not weary their life. Only by not wearying can one avoid weariness. The greatness of human nature can embrace heaven and earth. Those who do not know this take their four limbs and nine orifices as themselves. Clinging to them without weariness, their vision does not extend beyond sight, their hearing does not extend beyond sound—they are utterly confined. Thus the teaching says: Do not constrict their dwelling. Those who know this recognize the vastness of human nature and the narrowness of their own life. They are dismayed, desiring escape but unable, knowing the ways in which weariness and longing are shaped by things. Thus the teaching says: Do not weary their life. Only the sage is neither constricted nor wearied. He lives in common with others yet dwells in the Dao, without distinction between broad or narrow, pure or defiled. Only after not wearying of life does one know that life is without weariness.\n\nThus the sage knows himself but does not display himself; loves himself but does not esteem himself. Therefore he discards that and embraces this. Though the sage knows himself, he does not display himself; though he loves himself, he does not esteem himself, fearing that others will develop weariness and longing. If the mind of weariness and longing is not forgotten, there is still fear. Only when fear departs does great authority arrive.\n\n**Chapter 73: Boldness in Daring**\nBoldness in daring leads to death; boldness in not daring leads to life. These two may bring benefit or harm. Who knows the reason for heaven’s aversion? Thus even the sage finds it difficult.\n\nBoldness in daring leads to death; boldness in not daring leads to life—this is the constant principle of things. Yet the daring sometimes survive, and the not daring sometimes perish. The world thus relies on chance and neglects the constant principle. Heaven’s Dao is distant—how can there be such chance? Who knows the origin of its likes and dislikes? Thus even the sage takes the constant as correct and finds boldness difficult. *Liezi* says: \"To divine heavenly intent and weigh profit and harm is not as good as ceasing.\" This is the difficulty of knowing heaven’s Dao—thus it is repeatedly expounded.\n\nHeaven’s Dao does not contend yet excels in victory. It does not contend with things in the moment but ensures ultimate triumph. It does not speak yet excels in response. What does heaven say? The four seasons proceed, the hundred things are born—nothing is sought that does not respond. It does not summon yet comes of itself. The spirit’s arrival cannot be measured—how much less can it be compelled? Who summons it?\n\nVast and unhurried, it excels in planning. Vast and leisurely, as if without aim, yet its calculations surpass human understanding. Heaven’s net is vast and wide, sparse yet never failing. The world observes heaven through the ears and eyes, seeing only a fragment and not the whole. Those who do good and meet misfortune, or do evil and meet fortune, inevitably doubt that heaven’s net is sparse and often fails. Only by grasping its beginning and end, exhausting its transformations, can one know its vastness and breadth—though sparse, it never fails.\n\n**Chapter 74: The People Do Not Fear Death**\nIf the people do not fear death, how can death be used to frighten them? When governance is oppressive and punishments severe, the people have nowhere to place their hands and feet, and thus do not fear death. Even if death is used to frighten them, it is of no use.\n\nIf the people always feared death, and those who acted strangely could be seized and killed, who would dare? When the people are at ease with governance, delight in life, and fear death, then seizing and killing those who are devious and disrupt the multitude—who would dare not submit? There is always one who presides over killing. The one who presides over killing is heaven. When the world is well-governed and devious, disruptive people act wantonly, they are heaven’s outcasts. If I kill them, it is heaven killing them, not I.\n\nTo kill in place of the one who presides over killing is to take the place of the great carpenter in hewing. Those who take the place of the great carpenter in hewing rarely avoid injuring their hands. To kill when it is not heaven’s killing is to kill in place of the one who presides over killing. Taking the place of the great carpenter leads to injured hands; killing in place of the one who presides over killing leads to harm to oneself.\n\n**Chapter 75: The People’s Hunger**\nThe people’s hunger is due to their superiors consuming too many taxes—thus they are hungry. The people are difficult to govern because their superiors act with excessive effort—thus they are difficult to govern. Superiors use effort to guide the people, and the people respond with effort—thus affairs multiply and become difficult to govern.\n\nThe people disregard death because they seek excessive means to sustain life—thus they disregard death. Superiors place profit and desire before the people, and the people compete to enrich their lives—thus they seek profit even unto death without weariness. Only one who does not treat life as something to be done is more worthy than one who esteems life. The extreme of esteeming life must lead to disregarding death. Only one who does not treat life as something to be done preserves life naturally.\n\n**Chapter 76: Human Life**\nWhen humans are alive, they are soft and weak; when dead, they are hard and strong. All things, plants and trees, when alive are soft and fragile; when dead, they are withered and dry. Thus the hard and strong are followers of death; the soft and weak are followers of life.\n\nWhen the qi of harmony is present, the body is free from the affliction of hardness and strength. When the principle of the utmost is present, affairs are free from the burden of hardness and strength. Thus when armies are strong, they do not prevail. Armies that prevail through righteousness are not truly strong. Those that are strong yet unrighteous will swiftly be defeated.\n\nWhen trees are strong, they are felled. Trees that reach the size of a man’s embrace are inevitably cut down. The strong and great occupy the lower position; the soft and weak occupy the higher. This is the constant principle of things. The refined is above, the coarse below—the refined must be soft and weak, the coarse must be strong and great.",
      "overlap_context": "o;\naffairs are the tracks of the Dao.\nIf the Dao could be fully expressed in words,\nhearing words would suffice.\nIf it could be fully seen in affairs,\nexamining affairs would suffice.\nBut since words cannot exhaust it and affairs cannot reveal it,\none cannot but seek its source beyond words\nand its lord beyond affairs.\nFor the sages of old, without thought or action,\nthere remained a profound, natural, unselfconscious presence—\nthis is beyond the reach of thought.\nThus, in the end, none know me.",

      "translated_text": "The master’s conduct was lofty, his mind penetrating; delighted to follow me in study, he often discussed the Dao with me. He said to me, “What you discuss, I have already found in the Confucian books.” Daoquan replied, “This is the Buddha-dharma.” I said, “Not so. I have humbly heard that the Dao is what Confucians lack. Why insist on falsely claiming it as theirs? Yet if it truly exists among them, the world does not know it. The separation between Confucianism and Buddhism is like that between Hu and Han—they do not understand each other. How then do you know it?”\n\nDaoquan said, “Try to explain its outline for me.” I replied, “The grandson of Confucius, Zisi, wrote the *Zhongyong*. The *Zhongyong* says: ‘Before joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure arise, it is called the Center; when they arise and all hit the mark, it is called Harmony. The Center is the great root of the world; Harmony is the universal Dao. When the Center and Harmony are fully realized, Heaven and Earth take their places, and the ten thousand things are nurtured.’ Is this not the Buddha-dharma? The difference lies only in the source of the words.”\n\nDaoquan said, “How do you explain it?” I replied, “The Sixth Patriarch said: ‘Do not think of good, do not think of evil. At this very moment, what is your original face?’ Since the time of the Sixth Patriarch, more than half of those who have awakened have done so through these words. What is called ‘not thinking of good, not thinking of evil’ is the state before joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure arise. The Center is another name for Buddha-nature, and Harmony is the general term for the Six Perfections and the ten thousand practices. Fully realizing the Center and Harmony, Heaven, Earth, and the ten thousand things arise within them—what else could this be but the Buddha-dharma?”\n\nDaoquan, astonished and delighted, said, “I never knew this before. From now on, I see that Confucianism and Buddhism are one Dharma.” I smiled and said, “Not so. There are indeed not two Ways in the world, but the means of governing people differ. Between ruler and minister, father and son, if there is no ritual and law, there is chaos. Knowing ritual and law but not the Dao, one is merely a vulgar Confucian, not worthy of esteem. Dwelling in the mountains, eating wild plants, drinking from streams, yet holding the supreme Dao in the heart—one may become a teacher of humans and gods. But to govern the world, only the ancient sages, who embodied the Dao in their hearts and did not destroy the law, were fit for the task.”\n\nDaoquan bowed and said, “This is the ultimate teaching.” At that time, I was just interpreting the *Laozi*. Each time I completed a chapter, I would show it to Daoquan, who would sigh and say, “It is all the Buddha’s teaching.” I lived in Yunzhou for five years before returning north. Not long after, Daoquan passed away. Now, more than twenty years have passed. In my interpretations of the *Laozi*, I have occasionally made revisions, and there has never been a case where it did not align with the Buddha-dharma. With no one to discuss this with, I long to see Daoquan again and show him these words. Thus, I write this at the end of the *Laozi*.\n\n**Dated the tenth day of the twelfth month, second year of Daguan (1108), by Ziyou.**\n\n---\n\nWhen I was previously exiled to Haikang, I encountered my elder brother Zizhan in Tengzhou, and we spent over ten days together, discussing our lifelong studies. Zizhan said of my works, “Your *Poetry Commentary*, *Spring and Autumn Annals Commentary*, and *Ancient History*—all surpass what the ancients achieved. Only your interpretation of the *Laozi* seems somewhat lacking.” When I arrived in Haikang, with nothing to occupy me, I revised many of my writings. I then copied out the *Laozi* again and sent it to Zizhan. After this, I was graciously allowed to return north. Zizhan fell ill in Piling and passed away. More than ten years have now passed, and I still do not know whether this book met with his approval.\n\nIn the first year of Zhenghe (1111), in winter, I received from my nephew Mai and others a compilation of my late father’s manuscripts. Among them was one that read: “Yesterday, Ziyou sent his new interpretation of the *Laozi*. I read it without finishing the scroll, set it down, and sighed. Had this book existed in the Warring States period, there would have been no Shang Yang or Han Fei. Had it existed in the early Han, Confucianism and Daoism would have been one. Had it existed between the Jin and Song dynasties, Buddhism and Daoism would not have been two. I never expected, in my old age, to see such an extraordinary work—this must have been what Zizhan had in mind.” After living in Yingchuan for ten years, I have made many revisions to these four books, for the words of a sage cannot be fully understood in a single reading. Thus, whenever I gained new insight, I dared not consider my previous explanations definitive. Today, as I grow older, I believe I have reached a sufficient understanding.\n\nI wished to discuss this again with Zizhan, but it is no longer possible. Mentioning this brings me to tears.\n\n**Dated the eleventh day of the twelfth month, by Ziyou.**\n\n**End of the *Laozi* Commentary, Volume Three.**",
