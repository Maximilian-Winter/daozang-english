  "full_translation": "**The Scripture of the Eight Mighty Dragon Writings of the Primordial Beginning**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Scripture of the Eight Mighty Dragon Writings of the Primordial Beginning*. Author unknown. One scroll. Base text from *The Orthodox Daoist Canon*, *Dongzhen* Section, *Benwen* Category.\n\n**First Chapter**\nThat which cannot be named is the inception of the Dao; that which can be formed is the residue of the Dao. To know the inception is to unite with the Primordial Ancestor; to know the residue is to align with the pivot of yin and yang. Blending them into one accords with the harmony of Heaven and Earth.\n\n**Second Chapter**\nAt the dawn of primordial chaos, the Great Void resided within. Profound beyond measure, subtle beyond origin—how could it be fathomed? After the first division, within the indistinct and nebulous, the True dwelled at its core.\n\n**Third Chapter**\nThe valley’s emptiness preserves the spirit, which enters and exits through the gate of life and death. Cultivate and refine it without ceasing; guard and cherish it to secure the root.\n\n**Fourth Chapter**\nWhen the Mysterious Female harmonizes, qi intermingles, and the spirit coalesces to form the child-body. How could one favor the distant and abandon the near, or fail to forsake the illusory to follow the True? Knowing the ford of creation, one may transform the people. Heaven descends, Earth ascends, encircled by sun and moon, activated by thunder and lightning. Who can fathom the workings of its mechanism? Without speech, it benefits all beings, employing its function to universally embrace the sentiments of the world.\n\n**Fifth Chapter**\nIn the dim and vague, the spirit is born of fire; in the distant and obscure, essence is born of water. Fire blazes above, and through seven reversals, the spirit is born. Water flows below, and through six abodes, essence is generated. When spirit and essence unite, they commune with the numinous of Heaven and Earth.\n\n**Sixth Chapter**\nHe who hears enticing sounds harms his emptiness; he who gazes upon beauty seizes his essence. The wise resist this, for the spirit does not submit to desire. Thus, one may preserve it without alteration. Preserve your form, embrace your life, and do not let your thoughts wander restlessly. If thoughts wander restlessly, you forget your form and exhaust your life. How can you not be vigilant in guarding the True to preserve your sincerity? Yang moves, yin is still; above and below respond to become the numinous of the myriad things. Without stillness, how can there be generation? Without movement, how can there be tranquility? Hard and soft complement each other, achieving without striving.\n\n**Seventh Chapter**\nEmptiness without substance gives rise to fire; stillness without motion purifies water. He who knows this Dao may stabilize his nature to commune with the spirit, and calm his heart to circulate his qi. Great indeed is this teaching! It illuminates that guarding the body is not as good as guarding the spirit. When spirit unites with qi, and qi merges with the True, this is called the Perfected Person—like child and mother, never parted from the parent.\n\n**Eighth Chapter**\nUnite the beginning with the end, and the myriad things with the One. The marvel of gathering and dispersing can penetrate the emptiness and fullness of Heaven and Earth. Fire does not burn, water does not drown.\n\n**Here ends *The Scripture of the Eight Mighty Dragon Writings of the Primordial Beginning*.**",
