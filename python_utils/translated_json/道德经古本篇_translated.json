  "full_translation": "**Dao De Jing (Ancient Text Edition)**\n\n**Title:** *Dao De Jing (Ancient Text Edition)*\n*Collated by Fu Yi of the Tang Dynasty. Two scrolls.*\n*Source text: The Zhen Tong Dao Zang (Authentic Daoist Canon), Dun Shen (Cavern Gods) Division, Original Texts Category.*\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 1 (59 words):**\nThat which can be spoken of is not the eternal Dao.\nThat which can be named is not the eternal Name.\nThe Nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth.\nThe Named is the mother of all things.\nThus, the eternal Nameless—\nWe seek to observe its subtlety.\nThe eternal Named—\nWe seek to observe its limits.\nThese two emerge together yet differ in name.\nThough called by different names, they are one.\nThis oneness we call the Mysterious.\nThe Mysterious beyond the Mysterious—\nThe gateway through which all wonders pass.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 2 (93 words):**\nWhen all under Heaven know beauty as beauty,\nthen ugliness arises.\nWhen all know goodness as goodness,\nthen wickedness arises.\nThus, being and non-being produce each other,\ndifficulty and ease give rise to one another,\nlong and short define each other,\nhigh and low contrast each other,\nsound and voice harmonize,\nbefore and after follow in sequence.\nTherefore, the Sage acts without action,\nteaches without speech.\nAll things arise yet he does not initiate them;\nthey grow yet he does not possess them;\nhe acts yet does not rely on them;\nhis work is done yet he does not dwell upon it.\nBecause he does not dwell upon it,\nhe is never forsaken.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 3 (68 words):**\nDo not exalt the worthy,\nso the people will not compete.\nDo not treasure rare and costly goods,\nso the people will not steal.\nDo not display what is desirable,\nso the people’s hearts will not be disordered.\nThus, the Sage governs by:\nEmptying their minds,\nfilling their bellies,\nweakening their ambitions,\nstrengthening their bones,\never ensuring the people have no knowledge, no desires.\nWhen the clever dare not act,\nand action is without purpose,\nthen all things are done without interference.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 4 (42 words):**\nThe Dao is vast,\nyet its use is never exhausted.\nDeep, it seems the ancestor of all things.\nIt blunts the sharp,\nuntangles the tangled,\ndimms the gleaming,\nharmonizes the dusty.\nMysterious, it seems to exist yet not.\nI do not know whose child it is—\nit precedes the Sovereign.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 5 (45 words):**\nHeaven and Earth are not benevolent;\nthey treat all things as straw dogs.\nThe Sage is not benevolent;\nhe treats the people as straw dogs.\nBetween Heaven and Earth—\nis it not like a bellows?\nEmpty yet never exhausted,\nmoving yet never worn out.\nMuch speech leads to exhaustion;\nbetter to guard the center.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 6 (26 words):**\nThe Valley Spirit never dies—\nthis is called the Mysterious Female.\nThe gate of the Mysterious Female—\nthis is the root of Heaven and Earth.\nEndless, as if present,\nits use is inexhaustible.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 7 (49 words):**\nHeaven is long, Earth is enduring.\nWhy do Heaven and Earth endure so long?\nBecause they do not live for themselves—\nthus they can endure.\nTherefore, the Sage puts himself last,\nyet he is first.\nHe discards himself,\nyet he is preserved.\nNot because he seeks the private,\nhe achieves the private.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 8 (52 words):**\nThe highest excellence resembles water.\nWater benefits all things yet does not contend.\nIt dwells where others disdain to be,\nthus it is close to the Dao.\nDwelling is beneficial to the land.\nMind is beneficial as a depth.\nGiving is beneficial to others.\nSpeech is beneficial in trustworthiness.\nGovernance is beneficial in order.\nActions are beneficial in capability.\nMovement is beneficial in timing.\nThus, only by not contending\ndoes one avoid blame.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 9 (41 words):**\nTo hold and fill is not as good as stopping in time.\nMeasure with a vessel, yet it is easily broken—\nhow can it endure?\nGold and jade fill the hall, yet none can guard them.\nRich and noble yet arrogant—\nthey bring ruin upon themselves.\nWhen fame is achieved and work is complete,\nwithdraw—this is the Way of Heaven.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 10 (72 words):**\nNurturing the vital essence—\ncan one fail to preserve it?\nConcentrating the qi to attain softness—\ncan one resemble an infant?\nPurifying and preserving the Mysterious—\ncan one avoid blemish?\nLoving the people, governing the state—\ncan one act without knowledge?\nOpening and closing the Heavenly Gate—\ncan one be receptive?\nIlluminated and all-pervading—\ncan one avoid excess?\nNourishing yet not possessing,\nacting yet not relying,\nnurturing yet not dominating—\nthis is called the Mysterious Virtue.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 11 (49 words):**\nThirty spokes converge at one hub,\nyet it is the empty space that makes the wheel useful.\nClay is shaped into vessels,\nyet it is the empty space that makes them useful.\nDoors and windows are carved for rooms,\nyet it is the empty space that makes them useful.\nThus, what has is for advantage,\nwhat is empty is for use.\n\n---\n**Chapter 12 (49 words):** *(Translation pending—please provide the full text for completion.)*\n\n**Chapter 12 (49 words):**\nThe five hues blind the eyes,\nThe five tones deaf the ears,\nThe five flavors dull the palate,\nSwift hunting and coursing madden the mind,\nRare and costly goods disrupt conduct.\nThus, the Sage governs the belly, not the eyes,\nAnd discards the one to take the other.\n**Chapter 13 (88 words):**\nHonor and disgrace are like sudden alarm—\nWhat is called *great calamity* is like the body itself.\nHow does one honor and disgrace like sudden alarm?\nHonor is lowly—\nTo gain it is like alarm,\nTo lose it is like alarm:\nThis is called *honor and disgrace like sudden alarm*.\nHow does one value *great calamity* like the body itself?\nThe reason I have great calamity\nIs that I have a body—\nIf I had no body,\nWhat calamity would I have?\nThus, one who values the body above all else\nCan entrust himself to the world,\nAnd one who loves the body above all else\nCan commit himself to the world.\n\n**Chapter 14 (100 words):**\nWhat cannot be seen is called *level* (夷),\nWhat cannot be heard is called *rare* (希),\nWhat cannot be grasped is called *subtle* (微).\nThese three cannot be forced or interrogated,\nSo they merge into one.\nOne—\nIts upper reaches are not bright,\nIts lower depths are not dark,\nIts measure is unnameable,\nReturning to *non-being*.\nThis is called *the form of non-form*,\n*The image of non-image*—\nThis is called *芴芒* (Wu-mang).\nApproach it, you cannot see its head,\nFollow it, you cannot see its tail.\nHolding to the ancient Dao,\nOne can govern the present.\nTo know the ancient origins—\nThis is called *the record of the Dao*.\n\n**Chapter 15 (98 words):**\nThose anciently skilled in the Dao\nWere subtle, mysterious, and far-reaching,\nDeep as to be unknowable.\nSince it cannot be known,\nThey forced it into form, saying:\n*\"Proceeding with caution, like crossing a river in winter,\nSolemn, like fearing four neighbors,\nRespectful, like a guest,\nDissolving, like ice about to melt,\nThick, like uncarved wood,\nVast, like a valley,\nMingled, like muddy water.\nWho can clarify muddy water?\nBy stillness, it gradually clears.\nWho can prolong stillness?\nBy motion, it gradually arises.\nOne who preserves this Dao does not seek fullness.\nSince he does not seek fullness,\nHe can be exhausted yet remain unspent.\"*\n\n**Chapter 16 (67 words):**\nAttain utmost emptiness,\nHold steadfast to tranquility.\nAll things arise together,\nAnd I observe their return.\nEach thing returns to its root—\nReturning to root is called *tranquility*,\n*Tranquility* is called *restoring life*,\n*Restoring life* is called *constancy*,\nKnowing *constancy* is called *clarity*.\nIgnorance of *constancy* leads to reckless action—\nThis is ruinous.\nKnowing *constancy*,\nOne is tolerant,\nTolerance brings fairness,\nFairness brings kingship,\nKingship aligns with Heaven,\nHeaven aligns with the Dao,\nThe Dao endures eternally,\nAnd one’s life will not be cut short.\n\n**Chapter 17 (47 words):**\nThe *Supreme Sage* (太上) is known below only as *having*.\nThe next level, the people *love* him.\nThe next level, the people *praise* him.\nThe next level, the people *fear* him.\nThe next level, the people *despise* him.\nThus, when trust is insufficient,\nHow can there be no distrust?\nHow precious are these words!\nWhen affairs are accomplished,\nThe people say: *\"It happened naturally.\"*\n\n**Chapter 18 (28 words):**\nWhen the *Great Dao* is neglected,\nThere arise *benevolence and righteousness*.\nWhen *wisdom and insight* emerge,\nThere arises *great deceit*.\nWhen the *six bonds of kinship* are discordant,\nThere arise *filial piety and affection*.\nWhen the state is in chaos,\nThere arise *faithful and upright ministers*.\n\n**Chapter 19 (47 words):**\nTo abandon *sagehood* and discard *knowledge*,\nThe people gain a hundredfold.\nTo abandon *benevolence* and discard *righteousness*,\nThe people return to *filial piety and affection*.\nTo abandon *craftiness* and discard *profit*,\nThere are no thieves or robbers.\nThese three are insufficient for *culture*,\nYet they must be allowed to exist.\nTo see the *plain and simple*,\nTo have few desires and little self-interest—\n\n**Chapter 20 (137 words):**\nTo abandon learning, there is no anxiety.\nHow far apart are *\"yes\"* and *\"no\"*?\nHow different are *\"beauty\"* and *\"evil\"*?\nWhat the people fear,\nCannot be unfounded in fear.\nVast and unending—\nThe people rejoice as if feasting on the grandest sacrifices,\nAs if ascending to the spring platform,\nWhile I alone am somber,\nMy signs not yet revealed,\nLike an infant before its first cry,\nFrail and weak—\nYet not enough to be without direction.\nThe people all have excess,\nWhile I alone seem abandoned—\nMy heart is that of the simple fool.\nDim and indistinct—\nThe people are all bright and clear,\nWhile I alone seem benighted.\nThe people are all keen and discerning,\nWhile I alone seem dull and confused.\nFaint and drifting, like the sea,\nLight as if without end—\nThe people all have their ways,\nWhile I alone am stubborn and confused.\nI alone wish to differ from others,\nAnd value *the Mother* (食母) above all.\n\n**Chapter 21 (71 words):**\nThe *great virtue* takes form in the Dao alone.\nThe Dao, as a thing,\nIs only *芴* (wu) and *芒* (mang).\n*芴* and *芒*—\nWithin them is *image*,\nWithin them is *substance*.\nDark and obscure—\nWithin them is *essence*.\nIts essence is most true,\nWithin it is *faith*.\nFrom ancient to today,\nIts name never fades—\nTo observe all things.\nHow do I know all things are thus?\nBy this.\n\n**Chapter 22 (78 words):**\nThe *plain and simple* (素袌朴) take form in the Dao alone.\nThe Dao, as a thing,\nIs only *芴* (wu) and *芒* (mang).\n*芴* and *芒*—\nWithin them is *image*,\nWithin them is *substance*.\nDark and obscure—\nWithin them is *essence*.\nIts essence is most true,\nWithin it is *faith*.\nFrom ancient to today,\nIts name never fades—\nTo observe all things.\nHow do I know all things are thus?\nBy this.\n\n**Chapter 21 (71 words):**\nThe *great virtue* takes form in the Dao alone.\nThe Dao, as a thing,\nIs only *芴* (wu) and *芒* (mang).\n*芴* and *芒*—\nWithin them is *image*,\nWithin them is *substance*.\nDark and obscure—\nWithin them is *essence*.\nIts essence is most true,\nWithin it is *faith*.\nFrom ancient to today,\nIts name never fades—\nTo observe all things.\nHow do I know all things are thus?\nBy this.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 22 (78 words):**\nThe *plain and simple* (素袌朴) take form in the Dao alone.\nThe Dao, as a thing,\nIs only *芴* (wu) and *芒* (mang).\n*芴* and *芒*—\nWithin them is *image*,\nWithin them is *substance*.\nDark and obscure—\nWithin them is *essence*.\nIts essence is most true,\nWithin it is *faith*.\nFrom ancient to today,\nIts name never fades—\nTo observe all things.\nHow do I know all things are thus?\nBy this.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 23 (92 words):**\nWhat is crooked becomes whole.\nWhat is twisted becomes upright.\nWhat is hollow becomes filled.\nWhat is worn becomes new.\nWhat is little becomes gained.\nWhat is much becomes confused.\nThe sage *plain and simple* (素袌朴),\nAnd sets the pattern for all under heaven.\nHe does not display himself,\nTherefore he is bright.\nHe does not affirm himself,\nTherefore he is illustrious.\nHe does not vaunt himself,\nTherefore his merit endures.\nHe does not boast,\nTherefore he grows.\nOnly he who does not contend\nIs thus no one under heaven can contend with him.\nThe ancients said, *\"What is crooked becomes whole,\"*\nWas it mere empty words?\nIndeed it is whole and returns to its source.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 24 (48 words):**\nFew words come naturally,\nSo the gusting wind does not last a morning,\nAnd sudden rain does not last a day.\nWho does this?\nIt is heaven and earth.\nHeaven and earth cannot endure long,\nAnd much less can man.\nThus, those who follow the Dao\nAre in harmony with the Dao.\nThose who follow gain\nAre in harmony with gain.\nThose who follow loss\nAre in harmony with loss.\nIn those who follow the Dao, the Dao is gained.\nIn those who follow gain, gain is gained.\nIn those who follow loss, loss is gained.\n*Faith* is insufficient,\nHow can there be *unfaith*?\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 25 (87 words):**\nHe who strives to stand\nCannot stand.\nHe who strives to walk\nCannot go.\nHe who displays himself\nIs not bright.\nHe who affirms himself\nIs not illustrious.\nHe who vaunts himself\nHas no merit.\nHe who boasts\nDoes not grow.\nIn the Dao, it is said:\n*\"I eat my fill and move with leisure.\"*\nThings abhor it,\nTherefore, those who follow the Dao do not dwell there.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 26 (49 words):**\nThere is a thing that is *mixed and complete* (混成),\nBorn before heaven and earth.\nSilent and void—\nIt stands alone and does not change,\nIt moves through all and never falters.\nIt may be called the mother of all under heaven.\nI do not know its name,\nSo I forcefully name it the Dao,\nAnd forcefully call it *great* (大).\n*Great* means *passing* (逝),\n*Passing* means *distant* (远),\n*Distant* means *returning* (返).\nThe Dao is great,\nHeaven is great,\nEarth is great,\nAnd man is also great.\nWithin the fourfold greatness,\nThe king occupies one place of honor.\nMan follows earth,\nEarth follows heaven,\nHeaven follows the Dao,\nThe Dao follows *nature* (自然).\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 27 (97 words):**\nWeighty is the root of lightness,\nCalm is the master of agitation.\nTherefore the sage moves all day\nWithout leaving his baggage behind.\nThough he has palaces and feasts,\nHis dwelling is serene and detached.\nHow can he who commands ten thousand chariots\nLighten himself to bear the world?\nLightness leads to loss of roots,\nAgitation leads to loss of mastery.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 28 (85 words):**\nHe who knows the masculine\nGuards the feminine,\nIs a ravine for all under heaven.\nAs a ravine for all under heaven,\nHis virtue never departs,\nAnd he returns to the infant.\nHe who knows the bright\nGuards the dark,\nIs a model for all under heaven.\nAs a model for all under heaven,\nHis virtue never errs,\nAnd he returns to the boundless.\nHe who knows the honored\nGuards the humiliated,\nIs a valley for all under heaven.\nAs a valley for all under heaven,\nHis virtue is complete,\nAnd he returns to the *primordial* (朴).\nThe *primordial* scatters and becomes vessels.\nThe sage uses them,\nThus becoming the ruler and official,\nAnd the great measure knows no cutting.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 29 (60 words):**\nHe who would take all under heaven and do so,\nI have seen his failure.\nFor all under heaven is a *divine instrument* (神器),\nNot to be forced.\nTo force it is to spoil it.\nTo grasp it is to lose it.\nThings sometimes act or follow,\nSometimes are silent or loud,\nSometimes are strong or weak,\nSometimes rise or fall.\nTherefore the sage avoids excess,\nAvoids extravagance,\nAvoids dominance.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 30 (79 words):**\nHe who aids the ruler with the Dao\nDoes not use arms to force all under heaven.\nHis undertakings are simple,\nAnd the troops return of their own accord.\nWhere the army has been,\nThere are years of hardship.\nThus the good man is content with his lot,\nAnd does not dare to take more by force.\nContent without arrogance,\nContent without vaunting,\nContent without pride,\nContent without compulsion—\nThis is content without force.\nWhen things grow strong, they grow old.\nThis is called *not the Dao*,\nAnd *not the Dao* soon perishes.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 31 (135 words):**\nFine arms are an *auspicious instrument* (不祥之器).\nThings abhor them,\nTherefore those who follow the Dao do not dwell there.\nThus the sage values the left when at home,\nBut values the right when using arms.\nArms are an *auspicious instrument*,\nNot the instrument of the sage,\nUsed only when there is no alternative.\nHe who is tranquil and at ease is held in highest esteem,\nTherefore arms are not prized.\nIf they are prized,\nMen will delight in them.\nHe who delights in killing men\nCannot achieve his aims in all under heaven.\nThus auspicious undertakings favor the left,\nInauspicious undertakings favor the right.\nTherefore the left general is in command,\nAnd the right general is second.\nWords of the left are advantageous,\nAnd funeral expenses are placed on the right.\nMany deaths bring sorrow and tears.\nVictory in battle is treated as funeral rites.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 32 (71 words):**\nThe Dao is always nameless.\n\nThe Dao is always plain and simple,\nYet none under heaven can subdue it.\n\nIf kings and lords can guard it well,\nAll things will come of their own accord.\n\nHeaven and Earth unite,\nAnd sweet dew descends.\nThe people do not command it,\nYet it is evenly distributed.\n\nThe Dao was first named.\nOnce named, the sage knows when to stop—\nTo stop is to avoid peril.\nThe Dao’s presence in the world\nIs like that of streams and valleys to rivers and seas.\n\n---\n\nThe one who knows others is wise,\nThe one who knows himself is clear-sighted.\nThe one who overcomes others is strong,\nThe one who masters himself is powerful.\nThe one who knows contentment is rich,\nThe one who acts with resolve has purpose.\nThe one who does not stray from his place endures,\nThe one who dies yet does not perish attains longevity.\n\n---\n\nThe Dao flows vast and boundless,\nYet cannot be confined to left or right.\nAll things depend on it for life,\nYet it does not claim them—\nIts work done, it does not dwell on it.\nIt clothes all things yet does not rule them,\nSo it always lacks desire,\nAnd may be called *small*.\nAll things return to it,\nYet it does not know who their master is,\nSo it may be called *great*.\nThus the sage can achieve the Dao’s greatness,\nBecause he never considers himself great,\nAnd so can achieve the Dao’s greatness.\n\n---\n\nGrasping the great symbol,\nAll under heaven will follow.\nFollowing yet causing no harm,\nOne attains lasting peace and ease.\nDelight and bait,\nAnd the passing traveler will stop.\nThe Dao’s spoken words are bland,\nWithout flavor.\n\nTo look upon it is not to see,\nTo listen to it is not to hear,\nTo use it is never to exhaust.\n\n---\n\nWhen one would gather,\nOne must first let loose.\nWhen one would weaken,\nOne must first let grow strong.\nWhen one would ruin,\nOne must first let flourish.\nWhen one would take away,\nOne must first give.\nThis is called *subtle luminosity*.\nThe yielding overcomes the hard,\nThe weak overcomes the strong.\nFish cannot be caught in the depths,\nNor can the state’s sharpest tools\nBe shown to the people.\n\n---\n\nThe Dao is ever without action,\nYet nothing is left undone.\nIf kings and lords can guard it well,\nAll things will transform of their own accord.\nIf they act to transform,\nI will govern them with the uncarved simplicity of the Dao.\nThe uncarved simplicity of the Dao—\nThey will not desire it,\nAnd without desire, they will be tranquil,\nAnd all under heaven will be set aright.\n\n---\n*The Dao Classic, ancient text, concludes.*\n*The Virtue Classic, ancient text, concludes.*\n\nThe highest virtue does not claim virtue,\nAnd thus has virtue.\nThe lowest virtue clings to virtue,\nAnd thus lacks virtue.\nThe highest virtue acts without action,\nYet nothing remains undone.\nThe lowest virtue acts and yet fails to achieve.\nThe virtuous act for virtue’s sake,\nYet still fail to achieve.\nThe righteous act for righteousness’ sake,\nAnd thus achieve.\nThe ceremonial act for ceremony’s sake,\nAnd when none respond,\nThey force it with arms and threats.\nThus, when the Way is lost, virtue arises;\nWhen virtue is lost, benevolence arises;\nWhen benevolence is lost, righteousness arises;\nWhen righteousness is lost, ceremony arises.\nCeremony, the thinnest veneer of loyalty and trust,\nIs the beginning of chaos.\nPretense of foresight is the flower of the Way,\nAnd the start of folly.\nThus, the true sage abides in substance, not in veneer,\nIn reality, not in ornament.\nTherefore, abandon the latter and take the former.\n\n---\n\nIn ancient times, those who attained the One:\nHeaven gained the One and thus was clear.\nEarth gained the One and thus was tranquil.\nThe Spirit gained the One and thus was numinous.\nThe Valley gained the One and thus was full.\nAll things gained the One and thus were born.\nRulers gained the One and thus became steadfast for all under heaven.\nThis is how the One is attained.\nIf Heaven lacked clarity, it would fear shattering.\nIf Earth lacked tranquility, it would fear upheaval.\nIf the Spirit lacked numinosity, it would fear cessation.\nIf the Valley lacked fullness, it would fear exhaustion.\nIf all things lacked birth, they would fear annihilation.\nIf rulers lacked steadfastness, and yet sought exaltation,\nThey would fear ruin.\nThus, the noble rests on the base of humility,\nAnd the exalted rests on the foundation of lowliness.\nTherefore, rulers call themselves \"lonely and few,\"\nAnd \"not worthy\"—\nThis is their resting on humility,\nIs it not?\n\nThus, when praise is sought, it is not praise.\nDo not be dazzling like jade,\nNor cold like stone.\n\n---\n\nThe turning of the Way is its movement,\nThe yielding of the Way is its power.\nAll things under heaven arise from Being,\nBeing arises from Non-Being.\n\n---\n\nThe superior person hears the Way and strives to embody it.\nThe mediocre person hears the Way and holds it lightly, as if it might vanish.\nThe inferior person hears the Way and laughs in derision.\nIf it is not laughed at, it is not the Way.\nThus, the ancient saying goes:\nThe bright Way seems obscure,\nThe level Way seems uneven,\nAdvancing the Way seems like retreat.\nThe highest virtue is like a valley,\nThe greatest whiteness seems like darkness,\nThe broadest virtue seems insufficient,\nEstablishing virtue seems like theft,\nTrue simplicity seems like loss.\nThe greatest square has no corners,\nThe greatest vessel is fashioned last,\nThe greatest music is soft in sound,\nThe greatest image has no form,\nThe Way is hidden and nameless.\nOnly the Way is good at lending itself out\nAnd yet remains complete.\n\n---\n\nThe Way gives birth to One,\nOne gives birth to Two,\nTwo gives birth to Three,\nThree gives birth to all things.\nAll things bear yin on their backs and embrace yang before them,\nAnd through harmonious *qi* achieve balance.\nWhat men most despise—\nThe lonely, the few, the unworthy—\nAre the titles rulers take for themselves.\nThus, some things are diminished to benefit,\nOthers are increased to harm.\nWhat men teach me,\nI also teach to men.\nThe overbearing will not meet a proper end,\nAnd I shall make them my teachers.\n\n---\n\nThe softest thing under heaven\nOvercomes the hardest thing under heaven.\nWhat emerges from non-existence\nEnters without gaps.\nThus, I know the benefit of non-action.\nThe teaching of silence,\nThe benefit of non-action—\nFew under heaven attain them.\n\n---\n\nWhat is more intimate than name and body?\nWhat is more abundant than body and wealth?\nWhat is more painful than gain and loss?\nThus, those who love much must spend much.\nHoarding much will surely lead to great loss.\nKnowing sufficiency brings no shame.\nKnowing when to stop brings no peril.\nThis is how one endures.\n\n---\n\nGreat completion seems incomplete,\nYet its use is inexhaustible.\nGreat fullness seems like a vessel with a flaw,\nYet its use is boundless.\nThe most upright seems crooked,\nThe most skillful seems clumsy,\nThe most eloquent seems tongue-tied.\nFervor overcomes cold,\nTranquility overcomes heat.\nThe sage knows to embrace tranquility\nTo set the world aright.\n\n---\n\nWhen the Way prevails under heaven,\nWarhorses are driven to the fields.\nWhen the Way does not prevail under heaven,\nWarhorses breed in the suburbs.\nNo sin is greater than desiring what is forbidden,\nNo calamity is greater than insatiability,\nNo blame is deeper than covetousness.\nThus, true sufficiency is always sufficient.\n\n---\n\nWithout leaving one’s door,\nOne may know the world.\nWithout peering through windows,\nOne may know the Way of Heaven.\nThe farther one goes,\nThe less one knows.\nThus, the sage acts without going,\nNames without seeing,\nAccomplishes without doing.\n\n---\n\nThe scholar’s learning increases daily,\nThe Daoist’s practice decreases daily.\nDecrease and decrease again,\nUntil one reaches non-action.\nNon-action, yet nothing remains undone.\nHe who would take the world\nMust always do nothing.\nWhen action arises,\nHe is unfit to take the world.\n\n---\n\nThe sage has no fixed heart,\nBut takes the hearts of the people as his own.\nThe good, I treat well;\nThe not-good, I also treat well—\nThus, goodness is achieved.\nThe trustworthy, I trust;\nThe untrustworthy, I also trust—\nThus, trust is achieved.\nThe sage appears in the world,\nYet seems to withdraw;\nThe world is muddled, yet he is clear.\nAll eyes and ears are fixed upon him,\nYet he sighs as if weary.\n\n---\n\nBirth and death—\nThirteen perish in birth,\nThirteen perish in death,\nAnd of those who live,\nThose who move toward death are also thirteen.\nWhy so?\nBecause life’s abundance is too great.\nTruly, those who master life\nWalk on land without meeting rhinoceros or tiger,\nEnter battle without armor or weapons.\nThe rhinoceros has no place to thrust its horn,\nThe tiger no place to strike with its claws,\nWeapons no place to lodge their blades.\n\n「Why so? Because there is no place of death.\n**Chapter 51, 72 words.**\nThe Dao gives birth to all things;\nVirtue nurtures them.\nForm is given to them by things;\nForce completes them.\nThus, all things revere the Dao and honor virtue.\nThe Dao’s reverence, virtue’s honor—\nNo one bestows them,\nYet they remain ever natural.\nHence, the Dao gives birth without possession,\nActs without claiming,\nGrows without domination—\nThis is called the mysterious virtue.\n\n**Chapter 52, 73 words.**\nThe world has its beginning,\nAnd it can be called the mother of the world.\nHaving obtained its mother,\nOne may know its children.\nHaving known its children,\nOne returns to guard its mother—\nAnd thus, through life, one meets no danger.\nClose its openings,\nShut its doors,\nAnd one will never grow weary in life.\nOpen its openings,\nAid its work,\nAnd one will never be saved in life.\nSeeing the small as bright is called insight;\nHolding to the gentle as strength.\nUsing its radiance,\nYet returning to its brightness—\nNo harm befalls the body,\nThis is called the abiding norm.\n\n**Chapter 53, 54 words.**\nLet me speak plainly with knowledge,\nAnd walk the Great Dao—\nOnly fear is my guide.\nThe Great Dao is most level,\nYet people love narrow paths.\nMorning is most clear,\nYet fields grow overgrown,\nGranaries grow empty.\nFine garments adorned,\nSwords at their sides,\nSated with drink and food,\nYet wealth overflows.\nThis is called thieving display—\nThieving display is not the Dao!\n\n**Chapter 54, 86 words.**\nThe well-built cannot be uprooted,\nThe well-wrapped cannot be unwound—\nThus, descendants offer sacrifices without ceasing.\nCultivate it in oneself,\nAnd its virtue becomes true.\nCultivate it in the family,\nAnd its virtue overflows.\nCultivate it in the village,\nAnd its virtue grows long.\nCultivate it in the state,\nAnd its virtue becomes abundant.\nCultivate it in the world,\nAnd its virtue becomes universal.\nHence, observe oneself through oneself,\nObserve the family through the family,\nObserve the village through the village,\nObserve the state through the state,\nObserve the world through the world.\nHow do I know the world’s nature?\nBy this.\n\n**Chapter 55, 83 words.**\nThose rich in virtue\nAre like a newborn babe.\nWasps and hornets do not sting them,\nFierce beasts do not attack them,\nSnatching birds do not clutch them.\nTheir bones are weak, their sinews soft,\nYet their grip is firm.\nThey do not know the union of male and female,\nYet their life is complete—\nThis is the utmost refinement.\nThey cry all day yet never lose their voice,\nNor grow hoarse from shouting—\nThis is the utmost harmony.\nKnowing harmony is called constancy,\nKnowing constancy is called insight.\nIncreasing life is called auspiciousness,\nThe heart guides the qi—\nThen strength is achieved.\nWhen things grow strong, they grow old,\nThis is called not following the Dao—\nNot following the Dao brings early decline.\n\n**Chapter 56, 70 words.**\nThe wise do not speak,\nThe speakers are not wise.\nClose its openings,\nShut its doors,\nDull its sharpness,\nUntangle its complications,\nHarmonize its radiance,\nBlend with its dust—\nThis is called the mysterious unity.\nIt cannot be approached or distanced,\nCannot be used for gain or harm,\nCannot be esteemed or belittled.\nThus, it is the world’s most noble.\n\n**Chapter 57, 92 words.**\nGovern with the Dao,\nWage war with subtlety,\nConquer the world without conflict.\nHow do I know the world’s nature?\nBy this.\nThe world is filled with taboos,\nYet the people grow more chaotic.\nThe people multiply sharp tools,\nYet the state grows more benighted.\nThe people grow more clever,\nYet contentious disputes multiply.\nLaws and decrees grow more intricate,\nYet thieves and robbers abound.\nHence, the sage says:\nI act without action,\nYet the people transform themselves.\nI love tranquility,\nYet the people align themselves.\nI act without strife,\nYet the people grow rich.\nI desire nothing,\nYet the people return to simplicity.\n\n**Chapter 58, 64 words.**\nWhen governance is gentle and tender,\nThe people are simple and honest.\nWhen governance is strict and scrutinizing,\nThe people grow cunning and evasive.\nDisaster—\nIt depends upon fortune.\nFortune—\nIt hides within disaster.\nWho knows their limits?\nThe unaligned do not know.\nThe aligned become strange,\nThe good become rare.\nThe people’s confusion has long been fixed.\nThus, the sage is square yet not rigid,\nChaste yet not piercing,\nUpright yet not domineering,\nRadiant yet not dazzling.\n\n**Chapter 59, 60 words.**\nTo govern people and serve Heaven,\nNothing surpasses moderation.\nOnly moderation\nAllows early service.\nEarly service is called accumulating virtue.\nAccumulating virtue,\nThen nothing is not overcome.\nNothing is not overcome,\nThen no one knows its limits.\nNo one knows its limits,\nThen one may have a state.\nThe mother of having a state,\nMay endure long.\nThis is called the Dao of deep roots and firm foundations,\nLong life and lasting vision.\n\n**Chapter 60, 49 words.**\nTo govern a great state,\nAs if cooking a small fish.\nThose who rule the world with the Dao—\nTheir spirits are not numinous.\nNot that their spirits are not numinous,\nBut that the numinous do not harm them.\nNot that the numinous do not harm them,\nBut that the sage does not harm them.\nWhen both do not harm each other,\nThen virtue returns and dwells.»\n\n**Chapter 61, 89 words.**\nA great state is the world’s undercurrent,\nThe world’s confluence.\nThe world’s female—\nThe female always overcomes the male through tranquility,\nFor its tranquility, it is the undercurrent.\nThus, a great state yields to small states,\nAnd takes from small states.\nSmall states yield to great states,\nAnd take from great states.\nSometimes yielding to take,\nSometimes yielding while taking.\nGreat states seek only to nurture and shelter the people,\nSmall states seek only to serve the great.\nBoth attain what they desire,\nThus, the great should rightly yield.\n\n**Chapter 62, 85 words.**\nThe Dao is the hidden mystery of all things,\nThe treasure of the good,\nThe safeguard of the not-good.\nFine words can be sold in the market,\nNoble words can be bestowed upon others.\nWhen people are not good,\nWhat can they discard?\nThus, when establishing the Son of Heaven,\nAnd appointing the Three Exalted Ministers,\nEven if one offers a jade tablet with two handles\nOr four horses in a row,\nIt is not as good as advancing this Dao.\nWhy did the ancients value this Dao so highly?\n\n---\n\nThe Way is not spoken of as sought to obtain,\nNor is it used to avoid guilt.\nThus, it is rightly treasured by all under Heaven.\n\n**Chapter 63, 85 words.**\nAct without doing,\nWork without effort,\nTaste without savoring.\nGreat and small, many and few—\nRepay resentment with virtue.\nConfront difficulties when they are easy,\nAnd act upon great matters when they are small.\nThe difficult tasks of the world\nMust be achieved when they are easy.\nThe great undertakings of the world\nMust be accomplished when they are minute.\nTherefore, the Sage never acts upon greatness,\nAnd thus is able to complete it.\n\nHe who lightly promises must be few in trust.\nHe who takes many things lightly must meet many difficulties.\nThus, the Sage finds difficulty in difficulty,\nAnd so he never meets with difficulty.\n\n**Chapter 64, 131 words.**\nTo hold firmly what is tranquil is easy,\nTo plan when it has not yet emerged is easy.\nTo break what is brittle is easy,\nTo disperse what is minute is easy.\nTo act when it has not yet arisen,\nTo govern when it has not yet become disordered—\nThis is the Way of the Sage.\nThe great tree grows from tiny shoots,\nThe nine-layered terrace rises from piled earth,\nThe thousand-li journey begins beneath one’s feet.\nTo act and then ruin it,\nTo grasp and then lose it—\nTherefore, the Sage does nothing and so meets no ruin,\nDoes not grasp and so loses nothing.\nThe people often fail when their task is nearly complete.\nIf one is cautious at the end as at the beginning,\nThere will be no ruin in undertakings.\nThus, the Sage desires without desiring,\nDoes not prize goods that are hard to obtain.\nHe teaches without teaching,\nTo return the people to their errors.\nHe aids the natural course of all things,\nYet does not dare to act.\n\n**Chapter 65, 74 words.**\nThe ancients who excelled in the Way\nDid not enlighten the people,\nBut rather sought to bewilder them.\nThe people are hard to govern\nBecause they have too much knowledge.\nThus, to govern with knowledge is to harm the state,\nTo govern without knowledge is to benefit the state.\nAlways knowing these two principles\nIs to grasp the standard.\nTo grasp the standard is called the profound virtue.\nProfound virtue is deep and distant,\nOpposed to all things,\nYet it returns to the Great Harmony.\n\n**Chapter 66, 85 words.**\nThe Jiang and Hai [Seas] are able to be the sovereigns of all the valleys\nBecause they excel in yielding.\nThus, they are able to be the sovereigns of all the valleys.\nTherefore, the Sage desires to be above the people,\nBut he must first speak of yielding.\nHe desires to lead the people,\nBut he must first place himself behind them.\nThus, though the Sage stands above them,\nThe people do not feel heavy,\nAnd though he leads them,\nThe people are not harmed.\nTherefore, all under Heaven willingly follow,\nAnd do not grow weary.\nIt is not because he does not contend,\nThat all under Heaven cannot contend with him.\n\n**Chapter 67, 150 words.**\nAll under Heaven say of me:\n“I am great, yet seem unlike the great.”\nFor only because I am great,\nDo I seem unlike the great.\nIf I were like the great,\nLong ago I would have been small.\nI have three treasures,\nWhich I hold and protect:\nThe first is called compassion,\nThe second is called frugality,\nThe third is called not daring to be first under Heaven.\nCompassion, thus one can be courageous;\nFrugality, thus one can be abundant;\nNot daring to be first under Heaven,\nThus one can become the leader and the vessel.\nNow, abandoning compassion and yet seeking courage,\nAbandoning frugality and yet seeking abundance,\nAbandoning the last and yet seeking to be first—\nThis is called the gate of death.\nCompassion, when displayed, is upright;\nWhen preserved, it is strong.\nWhen Heaven is about to save someone,\nIt shields them with compassion.\n\n**Chapter 68, 47 words.**\nThe ancients who excelled in being a scholar were not martial,\nThose who excelled in war were not skilled in defeating enemies,\nThose who excelled in using people placed themselves beneath them.\nThis is called the virtue of not contending,\nThis is called the power of using people,\nThis is called aligning with Heaven—\nThe ancient ultimate.\n\n**Chapter 69, 57 words.**\nIn the use of arms, there is a saying:\n“I do not dare to be the aggressor,\nBut rather the defender.\nI do not dare to advance an inch,\nBut rather retreat a foot.”\nThis is called advancing without advancing,\nWarding off without arms,\nSeizing without weapons,\nAnd thus having no enemies.\nDisaster is not greater than having no enemies,\nFor having no enemies means nearly losing one’s treasure.\nThus, when armies are equal in strength,\nThe one who mourns will win.\n\n**Chapter 70, 51 words.**\nMy words are very easy to know,\nVery easy to put into practice.\nYet people cannot know them,\nCannot put them into practice.\nWords have a root,\nAffairs have a master.\nOnly because they lack knowledge,\nThey do not know me.\nFew know me,\nThus I am precious.\nTherefore, the Sage wears coarse cloth while holding jade in his heart.\n\n**Chapter 71, 32 words.**\nTo know that one does not know is best,\nTo not know that one knows is a disease.\nOnly because of this disease,\nOne does not fall into it.\nThe Sage’s freedom from disease\nIs because he recognizes the disease,\nThus he is not diseased by others.\n\n**Chapter 72, 48 words.**\nIf the people do not fear authority,\nThen great authority will come.\nDo not be familiar with what you dwell upon,\nDo not weary of what you produce.\nOnly because of not wearying,\nOne does not weary.\nThus, the Sage knows himself without revealing himself,\nLoves himself without prizing himself,\nAnd so he abandons that and takes this.\n\n**Chapter 73, 64 words.**\nTo be brave in daring is to kill,\nTo be brave in not daring is to live.\nThese two kinds—\nSometimes advantageous, sometimes harmful.\nWhat Heaven detests, who knows its reason?\nThus, the Sage finds difficulty in difficulty.\nThe Way of Heaven\nIs to conquer without contending,\nTo respond without speaking,\nTo be summoned without going,\nAnd to plan silently.\nThe Heavenly net is vast and wide,\nThough sparse, it does not lose its prey.\n\n**Chapter 74, 61 words.**\nThe people do not commonly fear death.\nHow can one use death to frighten them?\nIf one makes the people fear death,\nAnd treats it as something extraordinary,\nThen I can seize and kill them—\nWho would dare?\nThere are always those who execute killings,\nYet if one substitutes and executes killings,\nThis is to substitute the great carpenter.\nHe who substitutes the great carpenter\nRarely avoids injuring his own hands.\n\n**Chapter 75, 63 words.**\nThe people’s hunger\nComes from their rulers taking too much in taxes.\nThus, they hunger.\nThe people are hard to govern\nBecause their rulers act with intent.\nThus, they are hard to govern.\n\n**Chapter 76, 59 words.**\nThose who treat death lightly\nDo so because their rulers seek excessive life for themselves—\nThus, they treat death lightly.\nOnly those who do not prize life above all\nAre wiser than those who do.\n\n**Chapter 77, 87 words.**\nWhen people are born, they are soft and weak;\nWhen they die, they become stiff and strong.\nGrass and trees, when alive, are tender and fragile;\nWhen they die, they wither and decay.\nThus, the stiff and strong are the companions of death,\nWhile the soft and weak are the companions of life.\nTherefore, the strong in arms do not conquer,\nAnd the strong in wood will snap.\nHence, the stiff and strong are placed below,\nWhile the soft and weak are placed above.\n\n**Chapter 78, 41 words.**\nThe Way of Heaven is like that of one drawing a bow.\nIt depresses what is high,\nElevates what is low,\nReduces what is excessive,\nAnd supplements what is deficient.\nThe Way of Heaven reduces the excessive\nAnd supplements the deficient.\nBut the Way of humanity does the opposite—\nIt takes from the deficient to feed the excessive.\nWho among all can take from the excessive\nAnd give to the deficient throughout the world\nIf not the one who follows the Dao?\nThus, the sage acts without claiming credit,\nCompletes the task without taking residence in it—\nHe does not wish to be seen as virtuous.\n\n**Chapter 79, 73 words.**\nNothing under Heaven is softer or weaker than water,\nYet in attacking the stiff and strong, nothing surpasses it—\nFor there is nothing to replace it.\nThe soft overcomes the hard,\nThe weak overcomes the strong—\nAll know this, yet none can practice it.\nTherefore, the sage’s words say:\n*\"To bear the filth of the state\nIs to be called the master of the ancestral altars.\nTo bear the misfortunes of the state\nIs to be called the master of the world.\"*\nUpright speech seems contrary.\n*(End of Chapter 78.)*\n\n*«To reconcile great grudges, there will surely remain some grudge—\nHow can this be called good?\nThus, the sage holds only the left half of the contract,\nAnd does not demand recompense from others.\n\nTherefore, one with **virtue** oversees the contract,\nWhile one without **virtue** oversees its fulfillment.\nThe **Dao** of Heaven has no favorites,\nYet it constantly aligns with those of good nature.\n\n**Chapter 80, 85 words.**\nSmall states, few people—\nLet the people have tenfold or hundredfold implements yet not use them.\nLet the people prize death above relocation.\nThough there are boats and carriages, there is no need to ride them.\nThough there are armor and weapons, there is no need to display them.\nLet the people return to knotting cords for use.\n\nAt the utmost height of governance,\nThe people find their food sweet,\nTheir clothing fine,\nTheir customs content,\nTheir occupations joyful.\nNeighboring states are visible to one another,\nThe sounds of chickens and dogs are heard between them,\nYet the people do not travel to one another’s lands until they die of old age.\n\n**Chapter 81, 57 words.**\nFaithful words are not beautiful,\nBeautiful words are not faithful.\nGood words are not persuasive,\nPersuasive words are not good.\nThe wise are not learned in many things,\nThose learned in many things are not wise.\nThe sage accumulates nothing.\nHaving given to others, he is all the more possessed.\nHaving given to others, he is all the more abundant.\nThe **Dao** of Heaven benefits without harming.\nThe **Dao** of the sage acts without striving.\n*(End of the lower section of the ancient text.)*",

desirable,\nso the people’s hearts will not be disordered.\nThus, the Sage governs by:\nEmptying their minds,\nfilling their bellies,\nweakening their ambitions,\nstrengthening their bones,\never ensuring the people have no knowledge, no desires.\nWhen the clever dare not act,\nand action is without purpose,\nthen all things are done without interference.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 4 (42

and costly goods disrupt conduct.\nThus, the Sage governs the belly, not the eyes,\nAnd discards the one to take the other.\n**Chapter 13 (88 words):**\nHonor and disgrace are like sudden alarm—\nWhat is called *great calamity* is like the body itself.\nHow does one honor and disgrace like sudden alarm?\nHonor is lowly—\nTo gain it is like alarm,\nTo lose it is like alarm:\nThis is called *honor and disgrace like sudden alarm*.\nHow does one value *great calamity* like the body itself?\nThe reason I have great calamity\nIs that I have a body—\nIf I had no body,\nWhat calamity would I

about to melt,\nThick, like uncarved wood,\nVast, like a valley,\nMingled, like muddy water.\nWho can clarify muddy water?\nBy stillness, it gradually clears.\nWho can prolong stillness?\nBy motion, it gradually arises.\nOne who preserves this Dao does not seek fullness.\nSince he does not seek fullness,\nHe can be exhausted yet remain unspent.\"*\n\n**Chapter 16 (67 words):**\nAttain utmost emptiness,\nHold steadfast to tranquility.\nAll things arise together,\nAnd I observe their return.\nEach thing returns to its root—\nReturning to root is called *tranquility*,\n*Tranquility* is called *restoring life*,\n*Restoring life* is called *constancy*,\nKnowing *constancy* is called *clarity*.\nIgnorance of *constancy* leads to reckless action—\nThis is ruinous.\nKnowing *constancy*,\nOne is tolerant,\nTolerance brings fairness,\nFairness brings kingship,\nKingship aligns with Heaven,\nHeaven aligns with the Dao,\nThe Dao endures eternally,\nAnd one’s life will not be

people say: *\"It happened naturally.\"*\n\n**Chapter 18 (28 words):**\nWhen the *Great Dao* is neglected,\nThere arise *benevolence and righteousness*.\nWhen *wisdom and insight* emerge,\nThere arises *great deceit*.\nWhen the *six bonds of kinship* are discordant,\nThere arise *filial piety and affection*.\nWhen the state is in chaos,\nThere arise *faithful and upright ministers*.\n\n**Chapter 19 (47 words):**\nTo abandon *sagehood* and discard *knowledge*,\nThe people gain a hundredfold.\nTo abandon *benevolence* and discard *righteousness*,\nThe people return to

different are *\"beauty\"* and *\"evil\"*?\nWhat the people fear,\nCannot be unfounded in fear.\nVast and unending—\nThe people rejoice as if feasting on the grandest sacrifices,\nAs if ascending to the spring platform,\nWhile I alone am somber,\nMy signs not yet revealed,\nLike an infant before its first cry,\nFrail and weak—\nYet not enough to be without direction.\nThe people all have excess,\nWhile I alone seem abandoned—\nMy heart is that of the simple fool.\nDim and indistinct—\nThe people are all bright and clear,\nWhile I alone seem benighted.\nThe people are all keen and

to differ from others,\nAnd value *the Mother* (食母) above all.\n\n**Chapter 21 (71 words):**\nThe *great virtue* takes form in the Dao alone.\nThe Dao, as a thing,\nIs only *芴* (wu) and *芒*

on the base of humility,\nAnd the exalted rests on the foundation of lowliness.\nTherefore, rulers call themselves \"lonely and few,\"\nAnd \"not worthy\"—\nThis is their resting on humility,\nIs it not?\n\nThus, when praise is sought, it is not praise.\nDo not be dazzling like jade,\nNor cold like stone.\n\n---\n\nThe turning of the Way is its movement,\nThe yielding of the Way is its power.\nAll things under heaven arise from Being,\nBeing arises from Non-Being.\n\n---\n\nThe superior person hears the Way and strives to embody it.\nThe mediocre person hears the Way and holds it lightly, as if it might vanish.\nThe inferior person hears the Way and laughs in derision.\nIf it is not laughed at, it is not the Way.\nThus, the ancient saying goes:\nThe bright Way seems obscure,\nThe level Way seems uneven,\nAdvancing the Way seems like retreat.\nThe highest virtue is like a valley,\nThe greatest whiteness seems like darkness,\nThe broadest virtue seems insufficient,\nEstablishing virtue seems like theft,\nTrue simplicity seems like loss.\nThe greatest square has no corners,\nThe greatest vessel is fashioned last,\nThe greatest music is soft in sound,\nThe greatest image has no form,\nThe Way is hidden and nameless.\nOnly the Way is good at lending itself out\nAnd yet remains complete.\n\n---\n\nThe Way gives birth to One,\nOne gives birth to Two,\nTwo gives birth to Three,\nThree gives birth to all things.\nAll things bear yin on their backs and embrace yang before them,\nAnd through harmonious *qi* achieve balance.\nWhat men most despise—\nThe lonely, the few, the unworthy—\nAre the titles rulers take for themselves.\nThus, some things are diminished to benefit,\nOthers are increased to harm.\nWhat men teach me,\nI also teach to men.\nThe overbearing will not meet a proper end,\nAnd I shall make them my teachers.\n\n---\n\nThe softest thing under heaven\nOvercomes the hardest thing under heaven.\nWhat emerges from non-existence\nEnters without gaps.\nThus, I know the benefit of non-action.\nThe teaching of silence,\nThe benefit of non-action—\nFew under heaven attain them.\n\n---\n\nWhat is more intimate than name and body?\nWhat is more abundant than body and wealth?\nWhat is more painful than gain and loss?\nThus, those who love much must spend much.\nHoarding much will surely lead to great loss.\nKnowing sufficiency brings no shame.\nKnowing when to stop brings no peril.\nThis is how one endures.\n\n---\n\nGreat completion seems incomplete,\nYet its use is inexhaustible.\nGreat fullness seems like a vessel with a flaw,\nYet its use is boundless.\nThe most upright seems crooked,\nThe most skillful seems clumsy,\nThe most eloquent seems tongue-tied.\nFervor overcomes cold,\nTranquility overcomes heat.\nThe sage knows to embrace tranquility\nTo set the world aright.\n\n---\n\nWhen the Way prevails under heaven,\nWarhorses are driven to the fields.\nWhen the Way does not prevail under heaven,\nWarhorses breed in the suburbs.\nNo sin is greater than desiring what is forbidden,\nNo calamity is greater than insatiability,\nNo blame is deeper than covetousness.\nThus, true sufficiency is always sufficient.\n\n---\n\nWithout leaving one’s door,\nOne may know the world.\nWithout peering through windows,\nOne may know the Way of Heaven.\nThe farther one goes,\nThe less one knows.\nThus, the sage acts without going,\nNames without seeing,\nAccomplishes without doing.\n\n---\n\nThe scholar’s learning increases daily,\nThe Daoist’s practice decreases daily.\nDecrease and decrease again,\nUntil one reaches non-action.\nNon-action, yet nothing remains undone.\nHe who would take the world\nMust always do nothing.\nWhen action arises,\nHe is unfit to take the world.\n\n---\n\nThe sage has no fixed heart,\nBut takes the hearts of the people as his own.\nThe good, I treat well;\nThe not-good, I also treat well—\nThus, goodness is achieved.\nThe trustworthy, I trust;\nThe untrustworthy, I also trust—\nThus, trust is achieved.\nThe sage appears in the world,\nYet seems to withdraw;\nThe world is muddled, yet he is clear.\nAll eyes and ears are fixed upon him,\nYet he sighs as if weary.\n\n---\n\nBirth and death—\nThirteen perish in birth,\nThirteen perish in death,\nAnd of those who live,\nThose who move toward death are also thirteen.\nWhy so?\nBecause life’s abundance is too great.\nTruly, those who master life\nWalk on land without meeting rhinoceros or tiger,\nEnter battle without armor or weapons.\nThe rhinoceros has no place to

they are small.\nThe difficult tasks of the world\nMust be achieved when they are easy.\nThe great undertakings of the world\nMust be accomplished when they are minute.\nTherefore, the Sage never acts upon greatness,\nAnd thus is able to complete it.\n\nHe who lightly promises must be few in trust.\nHe who takes many things lightly must meet many difficulties.\nThus, the Sage finds difficulty in difficulty,\nAnd so he never meets with difficulty.\n\n**Chapter 64, 131 words.**\nTo hold firmly what is tranquil is easy,\nTo plan when it has not yet emerged is easy.\nTo break what is brittle is easy,\nTo disperse what is minute is easy.\nTo act when it has not yet arisen,\nTo govern when it has not yet become disordered—\nThis is the Way of the Sage.\nThe great tree grows from tiny shoots,\nThe nine-layered terrace rises from piled earth,\nThe thousand-li journey begins beneath one’s feet.\nTo act and then ruin it,\nTo grasp and then lose it—\nTherefore, the Sage does nothing and so meets no ruin,\nDoes not grasp and so loses nothing.\nThe people often fail when their task is nearly complete.\nIf one is cautious at the end as at the beginning,\nThere will be no ruin in undertakings.\nThus, the Sage desires without desiring,\nDoes not prize goods that are hard to obtain.\nHe teaches without teaching,\nTo return the people to their errors.\nHe aids the natural course of all things,\nYet does not dare to act.\n\n**Chapter 65, 74 words.**\nThe ancients who excelled in the Way\nDid not enlighten the people,\nBut rather sought to bewilder them.\nThe people are hard to govern\nBecause they have too much knowledge.\nThus, to govern with knowledge is to harm the state,\nTo govern without knowledge is to benefit the state.\nAlways knowing these two principles\nIs to grasp the standard.\nTo grasp the standard is called the profound virtue.\nProfound virtue is deep and distant,\nOpposed to all things,\nYet it returns to the Great Harmony.\n\n**Chapter 66, 85 words.**\nThe Jiang and Hai [Seas] are able to be the sovereigns of all the valleys\nBecause they excel in yielding.\nThus, they are able to be the sovereigns of all the valleys.\nTherefore, the Sage desires to be above the people,\nBut he must first speak of yielding.\nHe desires to lead the people,\nBut he must first place himself behind them.\nThus, though the Sage stands above them,\nThe people do not feel heavy,\nAnd though he leads them,\nThe people are not harmed.\nTherefore, all under Heaven willingly follow,\nAnd do not grow weary.\nIt is not because he does not contend,\nThat all under Heaven cannot contend with him.\n\n**Chapter 67, 150 words.**\nAll under Heaven say of me:\n“I am great, yet seem unlike the great.”\nFor only because I am great,\nDo I seem unlike the great.\nIf I were like the great,\nLong ago I would have been small.\nI have three treasures,\nWhich I hold and protect:\nThe first is called compassion,\nThe second is called frugality,\nThe third is called not daring to be first under Heaven.\nCompassion, thus one can be courageous;\nFrugality, thus one can be abundant;\nNot daring to be first under Heaven,\nThus one can become the leader and the vessel.\nNow, abandoning compassion and yet seeking courage,\nAbandoning frugality and yet seeking abundance,\nAbandoning the last and yet seeking to be first—\nThis is called the gate of death.\nCompassion, when displayed, is upright;\nWhen preserved, it is strong.\nWhen Heaven is about to save someone,\nIt shields them with compassion.\n\n**Chapter 68, 47 words.**\nThe ancients who excelled in being a scholar were not martial,\nThose who excelled in war were not skilled in defeating enemies,\nThose who excelled in using people placed themselves beneath them.\nThis is called the virtue of not contending,\nThis is called the power of using people,\nThis is called aligning with Heaven—\nThe ancient ultimate.\n\n**Chapter 69, 57 words.**\nIn the use of arms, there is a saying:\n“I do not dare to be the aggressor,\nBut rather the defender.\nI do not dare to advance an inch,\nBut rather retreat a foot.”\nThis is called advancing without advancing,\nWarding off without arms,\nSeizing without weapons,\nAnd thus having no enemies.\nDisaster is not greater than having no enemies,\nFor having no enemies means nearly losing one’s treasure.\nThus, when armies are equal in strength,\nThe one who mourns will win.\n\n**Chapter 70, 51 words.**\nMy words are very easy to know,\nVery easy to put into practice.\nYet people cannot know them,\nCannot put them into practice.\nWords have a root,\nAffairs have a master.\nOnly because they lack knowledge,\nThey do not know me.\nFew know me,\nThus I am precious.\nTherefore, the Sage wears coarse cloth while holding jade in his heart.\n\n**Chapter 71, 32 words.**\nTo know that one does not know is best,\nTo not know that one knows is a disease.\nOnly because of this disease,\nOne does not fall into it.\nThe Sage’s freedom from disease\nIs because he recognizes the disease,\nThus he is not diseased by others.\n\n**Chapter 72, 48 words.**\nIf the people do not fear authority,\nThen great authority will come.\nDo not be familiar with what you dwell upon,\nDo not weary of what you produce.\nOnly because of not wearying,\nOne does not weary.\nThus, the Sage knows himself without revealing himself,\nLoves himself without prizing himself,\nAnd so he abandons that and takes this.\n\n**Chapter 73, 64 words.**\nTo be brave in daring is to kill,\nTo be brave in not daring is to live.\nThese two kinds—\nSometimes advantageous, sometimes harmful.\nWhat Heaven detests, who knows its reason?\nThus, the Sage finds difficulty in difficulty.\nThe Way of Heaven\nIs to conquer without contending,\nTo respond without speaking,\nTo be summoned without going,\nAnd to plan silently.\nThe Heavenly net is vast and wide,\nThough sparse, it does not lose its prey.\n\n**Chapter 74, 61 words.**\nThe people do not commonly fear death.\nHow can one use death to frighten them?\nIf one makes the people fear death,\nAnd treats it as something extraordinary,\nThen I can seize and kill them—\nWho would dare?\nThere are always those who execute killings,\nYet if one substitutes and executes killings,\nThis is to substitute the great carpenter.\nHe who substitutes the great carpenter\nRarely avoids injuring his own hands.\n\n**Chapter 75, 63 words.**\nThe people’s hunger\nComes from their rulers taking too much in taxes.\nThus, they hunger.\nThe people are hard to
