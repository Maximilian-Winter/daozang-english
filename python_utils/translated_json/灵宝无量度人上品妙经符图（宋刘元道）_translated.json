  "full_translation": "**The Peripheral Comprehension Chart of the Supreme Wondrous Scripture of the Numinous Treasure for Salvation of Humanity**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *Peripheral Comprehension Chart of the Supreme Wondrous Scripture of the Numinous Treasure for Salvation of Humanity*\nCompiled by Daoist Liu Yuandao of the late Northern Song. Originally in three scrolls, now only the middle and lower scrolls remain.\n**Source Text:** *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, *Dongzhen* Section, *Lingtu* (Numinous Charts) Category.\n\n---\n\n**Middle Scroll of the Peripheral Comprehension Chart of the Supreme Wondrous Scripture of the Numinous Treasure for Salvation of Humanity** *(Upper scroll originally missing)*\nCompiled by Liu Yuandao, Purple-Robed Daoist of the Taiqing Chuqing Abbey and Guardian of the One\n\n### **The Thirty-Five Divisions: The Primordial Qi of the Upper Origin**\nThe Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper and the Twenty-Eight Constellations of the Four Directions comprise the Thirty-Five Divisions. They govern the primordial *qi* of the Upper Heavens, presiding over creation and transformation.\n\nThe Northern Dipper is the Central Dipper. As the *Records of the Celestial Offices* in the *Records of the Grand Historian* states: \"The Dipper is the Emperor’s chariot, revolving at the center and overseeing the four quarters. It divides yin and yang, establishes the four seasons, harmonizes the Five Phases, shifts the nodal measures, and determines all celestial patterns—all pivot upon the Dipper.\" This chart is drawn to observe the directional images. I have arranged the constellations to elucidate this chapter.\n\n### **The Thirty-Two Heavens: A Comprehensive Summary of Hidden Mysteries**\nFrom the Great Yellow Emperor’s *Huang* Heaven to the *Shangming* and Seven Luminaries’ *Moye* Six Heavens form the Desire Realm.\nFrom the *Xuwu* and *Yueheng* Heavens to the *Wuji* and *Tanshi* Eighteen Heavens form the Form Realm.\nFrom the *Haoting* and *Xiaodu* Heavens to the *Taisu*, *Xiule*, *Jin*, and *Shang* Four Heavens form the Formless Realm.\nThese are called the Three Realms.\n\nFrom the *Taixu Wushang Changrong* Heaven to the *Taiji Pingyu Jiayi* Four Heavens are the Heavens of the Seed People.\n\nUpon examining this scripture, I have divided it into ten matters:\n1. **Heavenly Names** – The names fixed at the beginning of the kalpa.\n2. **Imperial Titles** – The titles bestowed by the Primordial Beginning.\n3. **Imperial Taboo Names** – The names of the Heavenly Emperors.\n4. **Heavenly Emperor’s Governance** – The office of the Eternal Dao.\n5. **Constellation Qi** – The *qi* descending in connection with the Twenty-Eight Constellations.\n6. **Qi Names** – The names of the primordial *qi* as received.\n7. **Qi Colors** – The colors of the primordial *qi* as divided by direction.\n8. **Great Brahma’s Hidden Speech** – Established internally, composed by the Dao Lord. The details are expounded in the chapter on the origin of internal sounds in the lower scroll.\n9. **Divisional Boundaries** – The ascent and descent between upper and lower.\n10. **Lifespans of Heavenly People** – The measures of longevity and brevity.\n\nThis chart is the essence of the precious scripture; those who recite and uphold it should study it in detail and practice accordingly. I have synthesized the interpretations of Chen Jingyuan, combined with the *Xuan Ying Commentary*, Li Shaowei’s annotations, Xue Youqi’s notes, and Yan Dong’s commentary.\n\n### **Chart of the Primordial Harmony: The Scripture of the Cavernous Numinous Chapters**\nThe chapter is established by the *Scripture of Jade Characters of Internal Sounds*.\n\n**Heavenly Names | Imperial Titles | Imperial Taboo Names | Heavenly Emperor’s Governance | Constellation Qi | Qi Names | Qi Colors | Great Brahma’s Hidden Speech | Divisional Boundaries | Lifespans of Heavenly People**\n\n### **Explanation of Constellation Qi**\nThe twenty-eight heavens of the cardinal directions each correspond to the *qi* of one constellation. The four heavens of the intercardinal directions each correspond to the *qi* between two constellations. Furthermore, the descending and intersecting *qi* cause the heaven of the northeast to also connect with the constellation of the northwest—this is the ascending *qi* of generation, spiraling upward like a ram’s horns. Though the profound principles are thoroughly understood, confusion may arise regarding the directions and intercardinal points; thus, this chart is made to clarify them.\n\n### **Names and Taboo Names of the Five Directions’ Five Emperors and Their Governance**\nAs recorded in the scriptural meaning, the Five Heavens—each embodying the *qi* of the Five Spirits—reside in the midst of the Great Void. Above, the Five Dippers are arrayed; below, the Five Peaks stand. The Five Emperors govern them. These are the directional heavens of colors, not the heavens of formed images.\n\nThe names, taboo names, and governance of the Five Elders, Five Emperors, Five Dippers, Five Heavenly Demon Kings, and Five Great Demon Kings should be known by those who recite the scriptures. I have synthesized the interpretations of Chen Jingyuan, combined with the *Xuan Ying Commentary*, Li Shaowei’s annotations, the *Charts from the Essential Governance of the Shangshu*, and the *Scripture of the Five Chapters of True Writ* to establish this chapter.\n\n**Names and Taboo Names of the Five Directions’ Five Emperors:**\n- **Eastern Blue Heaven:** Blue Numinous Beginning Elder,

– Surname: *Xu*, Taboo Name: *Zhishi*.\n- Yellow Heaven Demon King – Surname: *Tianmen*, Taboo Name: *Bokuang*.\n\n**Names and Taboo Names of the Five Great Demon Kings:**\n- Great Demon of the Blue Emperor – Surname: *Poluo*, Taboo Name: *Wanxing*.\n- Great Demon of the Red Emperor – Surname: *Zhe*, Taboo Name: *Shangbai*.\n- Great Demon of the White Emperor – Surname: *Deng*, Taboo Name: *Xuni*.\n- Great Demon of the Black Emperor – Surname: *Xiao*, Taboo Name: *Gongsun*.\n- Great Demon of the Yellow Emperor – Surname: *Wangong*, Taboo Name: *Chansheng*.\n\n**Governance of the Five Emperors:**\n- The Blue Emperor guards the *hun*.\n- The Red Emperor nurtures the *qi*.\n- The White Emperor attends the *po*.\n- The Black Emperor circulates the blood.\n- The Yellow Emperor, the Central Lord, commands all spirits.\n\n**Governance of the Five Dippers:**\n- The Eastern Dipper governs calculation.\n- The Southern Dipper bestows life.\n- The Western Dipper records names.\n- The Northern Dipper decrees death.\n\nThe Central Dipper’s Great Chief oversees and monitors all spirits.\n\n**Governance of the Five Heavenly Demon Kings:**\n- The Blue Heavenly Demon King: *Bayuan Choubo*\n- The Red Heavenly Demon King: *Futian Danshi* (Bearer of Heaven and Stone)\n- The White Heavenly Demon King: *Fanshan Liumu* (Six-Eyed Mountain-Reverser)\n- The Black Heavenly Demon King: *Jianchou Langfu*\n- The Yellow Heavenly Demon King: *Hengtian Danli* (Heaven-Bearer of Strength)\n\n**The Eightfold Numerology**\nThe eightfold numerology corresponds to the number eight, here fully enumerated.\nI, Yan Dongzhu, have combined this with the *Dharma Wheel Sutra* to establish this chapter.\n\n**The Eight Awes:**\nDragon, Qilin, Tiger, Leopard, Lion, Vermilion Serpent, Heavenly Steed, Fierce Beast.\n\n**The Eight Luminaries:**\nSun, Moon, Jupiter (Wood Virtue), Mars (Fire Virtue), Venus (Metal Virtue), Mercury (Water Virtue), Saturn (Earth Virtue), and the stars of the Five Dippers.\n\n**The Eight Nether Poles:**\nEastern Pole, Southeastern Pole, Southern Pole, Southwestern Pole, Western Pole, Northwestern Pole, Northern Pole, Northeastern Pole.\n\n**The Eight Gates:**\nEastern Gate of the Heavenly Dharma Wheel, Southeastern Gate of the Heavenly Dharma Wheel, Southern Gate of the Heavenly Dharma Wheel, Southwestern Gate of the Heavenly Dharma Wheel, Western Gate of the Heavenly Dharma Wheel, Northwestern Gate of the Heavenly Dharma Wheel, Northern Gate of the Heavenly Dharma Wheel, Northeastern Gate of the Heavenly Dharma Wheel.\n\n**Division of the Scripture’s Beginning and End**\nThe Heavenly Worthy expounds two chapters of the scripture, each with a preface and postface.\nThe *Great Brahma Hidden Speech* likewise has a preface and postface.\nAll were composed by the Dao Lord.\nThe details are recorded in the lower scroll’s *Chapter on the Manifest Treasure Scripture’s Sealed Treasury Descending into the World* and the *Chapter on the Causes of the Inner Sounds’ Manifestation*.\nHere, the beginning and end are separated, the sections divided, and the character count fixed according to the canon.\nIncluding the titles, the total is four thousand five hundred seventy-four characters.\nI, following Chen Jingyuan’s principles and integrating Zhang Wanfu’s formulas, have established this chapter.\n\n**Section Titles:**\n- Two Chapters of the Supreme Dao Lord\n- Preface\n- Former Chapter of the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning’s Precious Scripture\n- Latter Chapter of the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning’s Precious Scripture\n- Postface to the Two Chapters of the Supreme Dao Lord\n- Preface to the *Great Brahma Hidden Speech*\n- Postface to the *Great Brahma Hidden Speech*\n\n**Scripture’s Beginning, End, and Character Count:**\nFrom “The Dao speaks: Once, in the Primordial Azure Heaven...” to “recite the scripture facing east,” one thousand five hundred ninety-five characters.\nFrom “The Primordial Beginning’s Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure’s original chapter...” to “the Five Emperors of the Three Realms array their words in the Supreme Clarity,” one thousand two hundred seventy-eight characters.\nFrom “The Primordial Cavern’s Jade Calendar...” to “those who leak and are arrogant fall into hell, their calamity extending to seven generations of ancestors,” seven hundred eighty-six characters.\nFrom “The Dao speaks: These two chapters...” to “thus shall one thoroughly comprehend the ultimate words,” four hundred forty characters.\nFrom “Among the heavens...” to “the middle section of the Numinous Writ,” nineteen characters.\nFrom “*Danlou Ahui*...” to “deliver beings in profound stillness,” two hundred fifty-six characters.\nFrom “The Dao speaks: Among these heavens, the *Great Brahma Hidden Speech*’s boundless sounds...” to “the boundless and profoundly mysterious,” one hundred eighty-six characters.\n\n**End of the Middle Scroll of the *Illustrated Companion to the Wondrous Scripture of the Uppermost Rank for the Limitless Deliverance of Beings***\n\n**Lower Scroll of the *Illustrated Companion to the Wondrous Scripture of the Uppermost Rank for the Limitless Deliverance of Beings***\n\nCompiled by Liu Yuandao, Purple-Robed Daoist and *Guardian of Unity* of the Supreme Clarity Repository of Blessings Abbey\n\n**Formulas for Reciting the Two Principal Scripture Chapters**\nOn days designated for scripture recitation, within a purified chamber, arrange an eastern-facing scripture table and seating. Enter the chamber, turn your back to the mat, and face east to perform the three bows.\nAfter bowing, retreat and sit facing north.\nOnce the *qi* settles, gradually turn left to face east and sit upright.\nRecite the incantation:\nSilent, reaching the ultimate origin,\nVastly towering through kalpas’ blades.\nThe *Huoluo* reveals the cavernous mystery’s scripture—\nWho can fathom this profound distance?\nEntering the Great Vehicle’s path,\nWho reckons the kalpas’ multitude?\nUnborn, undying,\nTo be born arises from the lotus.\nTranscending the Three Realms’ paths,\nA compassionate heart unravels the world’s snares.\nThe Perfected One’s supreme virtue\nMakes one a celestial household for generations.\n\nAfter the incantation, rest your hands on your knees and strike your teeth thirty-two times.\nClose your eyes and visualize the thirty-two heavens, each with its Emperor Lord.\nContemplate one heaven’s name and bow in your heart to its Emperor.\nBegin with the Heaven of Imperial Might, rotating with the sun, circling the four directions, gradually ascending to the Heaven of *Jiayi*.\nIn total, thirty-two bows—though the body remains still, the heart prostrates.\nAfter bowing, visualize yourself amid clouds of blue, yellow, and white *qi*, soon filling the chamber with dense, misty radiance.\nTo your left, the Azure Dragon; to your right, the White Tiger; before you, the Vermilion Bird; behind you, the Dark Warrior.\nSixteen lions sit in two rows before you, facing one another;\nAn equal number of white cranes stand beyond the lions.\nThe sun before you, the moon behind, illuminating the chamber.\nA nine-colored halo emerges from your crown, shining through all heavens.\nSurveying your visualization, all appears vividly before your eyes.\nSilently recite the incantation:\n\nThe Most High Mysterious Prime Supreme Lord of the Dao,\nsummon forth from within this servant’s body the Three and Five Merit Officers,\nthe Left and Right Attendants and Envoys,\nthe Jade Lads who tend the incense,\nthe Jade Maidens who transmit words,\nthe Direct Talismans of the Five Emperors,\nand the Incense Officials of the Day—thirty-two each,\nto open and relay all that is spoken.\nWhat is spoken refers to matters of Heaven and Earth,\nsun and moon, stars and constellations,\nthe sovereign, teachers and friends,\nancestors, oneself, and the multitudes of the people—all that is prayed for.\nWhen the incantation reaches the word “relay,” name these matters.\nToday is an auspicious and joyous day,\na day of long fasting and pure halls,\nof cultivating the scriptures and delivering boundless beings.\nThis servant, together with [name], or [name]—here name the same aspiration as above—\nor state: “This servant, together with so-and-so, or for such-and-such matter.”\nHaving recited the scriptures and received rebirth,\nmay all that has been relayed ascend directly\nto the august presence of the Most High Primordial Lord of the Thirty-Two Heavens.\nWhen the incantation is complete,\nslowly draw in one breath of *qi* from each of the Thirty-Two Heavens, swallowing it in turn.\nProceed as before.\nCease.\n\nThen open the eyes and recite the two chapters. Upon completing the recitation, face south, descend from the mat, bow again, and withdraw.\n\nFollowing the interpretations of Chen Jingyuan and the methods of Zhang Wanfu, these chapters are hereby established.\n\n**Quiet Chamber Diagram**\nThe Great Elixir is thus—within the illuminated chamber, there is no need to face south and open the door.\n\n**Recitation of the Inner Sound Formulae**\nRecite the sixty-four characters of the East:\nFrom *\"Danlou Ahui\"* to *\"Sixiang Xuyuan.\"*\nSit upright, click the teeth nine times, and visualize nine-colored dragons guiding before and behind, with nine layers of azure clouds enveloping the body.\nSilently intone the incantation:\n*\"Vermilion brightness unfolds the chart,\nEight qi return to the true.\nGoverning the Mysterious Gate,\nGreat Azure Emperor Divine.\nFlowing transformation beyond the nine,\nEntwining my form.\nSacred sounds of eight writings,\nSixty-four scrolls.\nPenetrating heaven and earth,\nUniting with me as immortal.\nConveying the dragon chariot,\nAscending to the imperial axle.\"*\nConclude, draw in *qi* nine times, swallowing it, and recite.\n\nRecite the sixty-four characters of the South:\nFrom *\"Nanyan Dongfu\"* to *\"Shenying Zigong.\"*\nSit upright, click the teeth three times, and visualize a vermilion phoenix soaring before you, with three layers of crimson clouds enveloping the body.\nSilently intone the incantation:\n*\"Three qi linger and circle,\nSacred phoenix comes in flight.\nJade sounds of eight characters,\nResplendent in the Purple Tenuity.\nAuspicious day, great celebration,\nMy Dao unfolds in radiance.\nCrimson cinnabar nourishes,\nGaze upward to absorb the divine light.\nBody born of water and fire,\nCrimson-clad in feathered robes.\nAscend the void with mystic steps,\nFeet treading the phoenix ladder.\nCircling the eight heavens,\nSeven ancestors follow in tow.\"*\nConclude, draw in *qi* three times, swallowing it, and recite.\n\nRecite the sixty-four characters of the West:\nFrom *\"Daoli Huiyou\"* to *\"Baikong Duxian.\"*\nSit upright, click the teeth seven times, and visualize white tigers and lions guarding before and behind, with seven layers of pale clouds enveloping the body.\nSilently intone the incantation:\n*\"Seven qi of golden numen,\nEight heavens’ honored divinities.\nWhite tiger steers the chariot,\nLions bear the axle.\nSeven qi entwine,\nRefining me into immortal.\nBody ascends in golden light,\nShining upon the pale clouds.\nInner and outer transformation,\nRising into the cavernous gate.\nSeven ancestors escape the night,\nNine dark realms turn their souls.\nEons of deliverance,\nAbiding with the turning of the Dao.\"*\nConclude, draw in *qi* seven times, swallowing it, and recite.\n\nRecite the sixty-four characters of the North:\nFrom *\"Juewu Ziyu\"* to *\"Youji Duren.\"*\nSit upright, click the teeth five times, and visualize flying dragons and the Dark Warrior, their feathered canopies lush and dense; divine lads and jade maidens in feathered robes and flying skirts. Five layers of black clouds envelop the body.\nSilently intone the incantation:\n*\"Mysterious heavens linger and circle,\nFlowing radiance ascends to the Upper Clarity.\nGreat Possession initiates the turning,\nEight characters of lofty brightness.\nFlying darkness stills the void,\nYin of the cavern generates itself.\nFive qi entwine,\nIrrigating my form.\nCrowned and girded in the Northern Loneliness,\nReceiving refinement from the cavernous numen.\nKidney palace emerges from the north,\nInner and outer luminous essence.\nSoaring through the Three Realms,\nRoaming and feasting in the Purple Court.\nSeven ancestors share in fortune,\nRejoicing in kalpas of age.\nWithin the forest of seven treasures,\nReturn to the womb and be reborn.\nEscape the long night,\nName recorded in the Southern Palace.\nYellow Register and White Tablet,\nGeneration upon generation born as immortals.\"*\nConclude, draw in *qi* five times, swallowing it, and recite.\n\n**Verification of Reciting the Two Chapters of the Orthodox Scripture**\nDuring the long fast of the first month, recite and chant this scripture to sever the earthly bonds of past lives’ souls, delivering them to the Southern Palace.\nDuring the long fast of the seventh month, recite and chant this scripture to attain divine transcendence, with names inscribed in the heavens.\nYellow Register and White Tablet erase death and grant rebirth.\nDuring the long fast of the tenth month, recite and chant this scripture for the emperor and sovereign, ruler and ministers, father and son, to stabilize the nation’s destiny and preserve the heavens’ longevity.\nGeneration upon generation unbroken, ever ruling as sovereigns.\nStabilizing their realm, the people proclaim great peace.\n\nOn the days of the eight solar terms, recite and chant this scripture to become a Perfected of the Nine Palaces.\nOn one’s natal day, recite and chant this scripture to purify the soul and spirit, eternally abiding in the myriad *qi*, free from suffering, the body radiant with light.\nAttended by the Three Realms, welcomed by the Five Emperors, myriad spirits pay homage, and names are inscribed in the heavens above.\nWith merits fulfilled and virtue perfected, ascend to the Upper Clarity.\nRecite ten times, and the heavens record the merit.\nRecite a hundred times, and names are delivered to the Southern Palace.\nRecite a thousand times, and demon kings guard and welcome.\nRecite ten thousand times, and the Dao is complete—ascend to the Great Void.\n\nIf one encounters such an occasion and recites according to the formula, above, it dispels heavenly disasters and safeguards the emperor; below, it wards off poison and harm to deliver the multitudes; in the middle, it rescues ancestors and grants oneself the Dao.\nThis may be called the majestic Great Brahma, the unmatched wanderer of the Jade Capital.\n\n**Verification of Reciting the Inner Sounds**\nThe Great Brahma sound of the East: recite for nine years, and the eight heavens each send eight Azure-Waisted Jade Maidens and Azure-Florescence Jade Lads to attend the body, descending the essence of Azure Teeth. The body generates radiant light, penetrating the void.\nAfter ten thousand recitations, the Dao is perfected—soar to the Upper Clarity, and seven ancestors share in fortune, all ascending to the Southern Palace.\n\nThe Great Brahma sound of the South: recite for three years, and the eight heavens each send eight Great Cinnabar Jade Maidens and Great Yang Jade Lads to attend the body, descending the essence of the three crimson *qi*. White returns to the countenance.\nUnshaken for ten thousand kalpas, seven ancestors transcend and ascend, entering the Hall of Fortune, returning to the immortal womb to be reborn.\n\nThe Great Brahma sound of the West: recite for seven years, and the eight heavens each send eight Pale Numen Jade Lads to attend the body, descending the essence of the seven pale *qi*. Years halt, and the visage remains youthful for ten thousand kalpas.\nFortune extends to seven ancestors, ascending to the Southern Palace, returning to the womb to be reborn, generation upon generation as immortals.\n\nThe Great Brahma sound of the North: recite for five years, and the eight heavens each send eight Great Prime Jade Lads to attend the body, descending the essence of the five nourishing *qi*. Years return, and radiance abides—life preserved in the Three Clarities. Fortune extends to the nine lineages, generation upon generation ascending.\nIf one recites the inner sounds of the four directions according to the formula, there is nothing that cannot be averted, nothing that cannot be warded, nothing that cannot be delivered, nothing that cannot be accomplished.\n\nThe Flying Celestials descend in observation, the Supreme Emperor chants from afar, the myriad spirits prostrate in homage, and the Three Realms attend in reverence. Subduing the host of spirits, purifying the ten directions, the Dao perfected and merit accomplished, one serves the Three Clarities as a minister. Humbly, I, Zhang Wanfu, have annotated this fixed chapter to elucidate its meaning.\n\nThe *Mingbao Sutra* was sealed and concealed upon its descent into the world.\nThe Heavenly Worthy, in the Azure Beginning Heaven, expounded this scripture and bestowed it upon the Dao Lord. Later, in the Great Cinnabar Heaven, the Great Brahma sounds were granted. After the Dao Lord compiled its sequence, it was treasured in heaven and concealed within the Purple Tenuity Palace of the Jade Capital in the Mysterious Metropolis. Its sealing is of utmost gravity—transmitted only to the sagely. Later, the Queen Mother of the West petitioned the Heavenly Emperor to descend it for averting the calamity of the *jiashen* year, entrusting it to practitioners of the true Dao, whence it circulated among mortals. This scripture comprises the hidden hymns of the Celestial Emperors and the secret chants of the Numinous Demon Kings, revealing the kalpic fortunes of heaven and earth, the names and titles of the myriad spirits, the conjunction of yin and yang, and the generation and transformation of primordial *qi*. Its meanings cannot be fully fathomed, nor its principles fully unraveled. Those who attain enlightenment shall naturally achieve profound clarity. In heaven, it is transmitted once every forty thousand kalpas; among mortals, once every forty years. To leak or profane it lightly brings misfortune upon nine generations, condemning them to eternal servitude in the nether darkness. How can one not be cautious? How can one not be cautious! Humbly, I, Li Shaowei, have annotated this chapter to clarify its meaning.\n\nOn the Origin of the Inner Sounds\nIn the Crimson Clarity World, the Heavenly Worthy ascended the Cypress Terrace throne. At that moment, clouds and mist surged thickly for three days and nights, and the gloom of yin did not disperse. The Five Elder Thearchs prostrated before the Heavenly Worthy, saying: \"Such a sight has never been witnessed in our attendance today.\" When the Heavenly Worthy expounded the teachings, mountains and seas fell silent, and heaven and earth grew solemnly still. Yet now, in broad daylight, darkness prevails, and the celestial and human realms tremble in fear. We, your ministers, harbor doubts—we know not the reason.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy declared: \"Today, the various heavens manifest auspicious signs, and numinous responses arise spontaneously. Jade characters blaze resplendently, obscuring the light of life. Let all present close their eyes and await.\" In an instant, the celestial *qi* suddenly parted, the gloom dissolved, and five-colored radiance illuminated the ten directions. Each bore a script of numinous writing, its characters a *zhang* in size, manifesting in the void. Their brilliance dazzled, their eight corners trailing beams of light, their splendor too bright to behold.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy proclaimed to the assembled spirits: \"This is the *Lingshu of the Eight Meetings*—its characters lack fixed form, its purport profound and subtle. You would find it difficult to trace or fathom.\" Thereupon, the command was given to the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign to transcribe its characters and explicate its sounds, bestowing them upon the Dao Lord, totaling two hundred and fifty-six characters. The Dao Lord arranged them into text, calling it the *Hidden Language of the Great Brahma*. It was appended to the two subsequent chapters in sequence.\n\nThe Sovereign was one who once descended upon Mount Emei during the reign of the Yellow Emperor, imparting to him the method of the Three Ones and Five Sprouts, before ascending once more to heaven. Humbly, I have collated the *Inner Sounds Sutra* with the *Biographies of the Immortals* to annotate this chapter.\n\nCitations\nThe *Scripture of the Jade Capital Mountain* of the Most High.\n\n*The Five Chapters of the Numinous Treasure’s Red Writ of the True Scriptures*\n*The Scripture of the Nine Heavens’ Generation of the Divine*\n*The Most High’s Scripture of the Dragon-Soaring Opening of Heaven*\n*The Scripture of the Cavernous Void’s Numinous Chapters*\n*The Scripture of the Jade Characters of the Inner Sounds of the Heavens’ Spontaneous Nature*\n*The Inner Writ of the Azure Youth*\n*The Wondrous Scripture of the Wheel of Admonitions of the True One*\n*The Most High’s Scripture of the Three Primes’ Precepts*\n*The Golden Mirror and Numinous Pivot of the Heavenly Treasure*\n*The Regulations of the Perfected*\n*Sima Qian’s* Records of the Grand Historian: *Treatise on the Celestial Offices*\n*The Rite of Repentance for Dispelling Calamities*\n*Liu Xiang’s* Biographies of the Immortals\n*Du Guangting’s* Diagram of the Primordial Origin\n*The Diagram of the Sacred Positions of the Northern Dipper and Their Lateral Connections*\n*Zhang Songchen’s* Diagram of the Arrayed Constellations\n*Shu Bing’s* Essential Diagrams from the *Book of Documents*\n*Chen Jingyuan’s* Diagram of the Sacred Positions Throughout the Heavens\n*Li Sicong’s* *Anthology of the Cavernous Abyss*\n*Zhang Wanfu’s* Oral Instructions on the Numinous Treasure Scriptures\n*The Revised Oral Instructions on the Numinous Treasure Scriptures*\n*Yan Dong’s* Commentary on the Numinous Treasure Scriptures\n*Xue Youqi’s* Commentary on the Numinous Treasure Scriptures\n*Li Shaowei’s* Commentary on the Numinous Treasure Scriptures\n*Cheng Xuanying’s* Subcommentary on the *Scripture of Salvation*\n*Chen Jingyuan’s* *Subtle Meaning of the Jeweled Pearl*\n*The Lower Scroll of the Diagram of Lateral Connections to the* Wondrous Scripture of the Uppermost Rank of the *Limitless Salvation*",

      "translated_text": "**The Peripheral Comprehension Chart of the Supreme Wondrous Scripture of the Numinous Treasure for Salvation of Humanity**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *Peripheral Comprehension Chart of the Supreme Wondrous Scripture of the Numinous Treasure for Salvation of Humanity*\nCompiled by Daoist Liu Yuandao of the late Northern Song. Originally in three scrolls, now only the middle and lower scrolls remain.\n**Source Text:** *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, *Dongzhen* Section, *Lingtu* (Numinous Charts) Category.\n\n---\n\n**Middle Scroll of the Peripheral Comprehension Chart of the Supreme Wondrous Scripture of the Numinous Treasure for Salvation of Humanity** *(Upper scroll originally missing)*\nCompiled by Liu Yuandao, Purple-Robed Daoist of the Taiqing Chuqing Abbey and Guardian of the One\n\n### **The Thirty-Five Divisions: The Primordial Qi of the Upper Origin**\nThe Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper and the Twenty-Eight Constellations of the Four Directions comprise the Thirty-Five Divisions. They govern the primordial *qi* of the Upper Heavens, presiding over creation and transformation.\n\nThe Northern Dipper is the Central Dipper. As the *Records of the Celestial Offices* in the *Records of the Grand Historian* states: \"The Dipper is the Emperor’s chariot, revolving at the center and overseeing the four quarters. It divides yin and yang, establishes the four seasons, harmonizes the Five Phases, shifts the nodal measures, and determines all celestial patterns—all pivot upon the Dipper.\" This chart is drawn to observe the directional images. I have arranged the constellations to elucidate this chapter.\n\n### **The Thirty-Two Heavens: A Comprehensive Summary of Hidden Mysteries**\nFrom the Great Yellow Emperor’s *Huang* Heaven to the *Shangming* and Seven Luminaries’ *Moye* Six Heavens form the Desire Realm.\nFrom the *Xuwu* and *Yueheng* Heavens to the *Wuji* and *Tanshi* Eighteen Heavens form the Form Realm.\nFrom the *Haoting* and *Xiaodu* Heavens to the *Taisu*, *Xiule*, *Jin*, and *Shang* Four Heavens form the Formless Realm.\nThese are called the Three Realms.\n\nFrom the *Taixu Wushang Changrong* Heaven to the *Taiji Pingyu Jiayi* Four Heavens are the Heavens of the Seed People.\n\nUpon examining this scripture, I have divided it into ten matters:\n1. **Heavenly Names** – The names fixed at the beginning of the kalpa.\n2. **Imperial Titles** – The titles bestowed by the Primordial Beginning.\n3. **Imperial Taboo Names** – The names of the Heavenly Emperors.\n4. **Heavenly Emperor’s Governance** – The office of the Eternal Dao.\n5. **Constellation Qi** – The *qi* descending in connection with the Twenty-Eight Constellations.\n6. **Qi Names** – The names of the primordial *qi* as received.\n7. **Qi Colors** – The colors of the primordial *qi* as divided by direction.\n8. **Great Brahma’s Hidden Speech** – Established internally, composed by the Dao Lord. The details are expounded in the chapter on the origin of internal sounds in the lower scroll.\n9. **Divisional Boundaries** – The ascent and descent between upper and lower.\n10. **Lifespans of Heavenly People** – The measures of longevity and brevity.\n\nThis chart is the essence of the precious scripture; those who recite and uphold it should study it in detail and practice accordingly. I have synthesized the interpretations of Chen Jingyuan, combined with the *Xuan Ying Commentary*, Li Shaowei’s annotations, Xue Youqi’s notes, and Yan Dong’s commentary.\n\n### **Chart of the Primordial Harmony: The Scripture of the Cavernous Numinous Chapters**\nThe chapter is established by the *Scripture of Jade Characters of Internal Sounds*.\n\n**Heavenly Names | Imperial Titles | Imperial Taboo Names | Heavenly Emperor’s Governance | Constellation Qi | Qi Names | Qi Colors | Great Brahma’s Hidden Speech | Divisional Boundaries | Lifespans of Heavenly People**\n\n### **Explanation of Constellation Qi**\nThe twenty-eight heavens of the cardinal directions each correspond to the *qi* of one constellation. The four heavens of the intercardinal directions each correspond to the *qi* between two constellations. Furthermore, the descending and intersecting *qi* cause the heaven of the northeast to also connect with the constellation of the northwest—this is the ascending *qi* of generation, spiraling upward like a ram’s horns. Though the profound principles are thoroughly understood, confusion may arise regarding the directions and intercardinal points; thus, this chart is made to clarify them.\n\n### **Names and Taboo Names of the Five Directions’ Five Emperors and Their Governance**\nAs recorded in the scriptural meaning, the Five Heavens—each embodying the *qi* of the Five Spirits—reside in the midst of the Great Void. Above, the Five Dippers are arrayed; below, the Five Peaks stand. The Five Emperors govern them. These are the directional heavens of colors, not the heavens of formed images.\n\nThe names, taboo names, and governance of the Five Elders, Five Emperors, Five Dippers, Five Heavenly Demon Kings, and Five Great Demon Kings should be known by those who recite the scriptures. I have synthesized the interpretations of Chen Jingyuan, combined with the *Xuan Ying Commentary*, Li Shaowei’s annotations, the *Charts from the Essential Governance of the Shangshu*, and the *Scripture of the Five Chapters of True Writ* to establish this chapter.\n\n**Names and Taboo Names of the Five Directions’ Five Emperors:**\n- **Eastern Blue Heaven:** Blue Numinous Beginning Elder, Blue Emperor – Surname: *Lan*, Taboo Name: *Kaiming*, Title: *Ling Weiyang*.\n- **Southern Red Heaven:** Cinnabar Numinous True Elder, Red Emperor – Surname: *Dongfu*, Taboo Name: *Liuyan*, Title: *Chi Biaonu*.\n- **Western White Heaven:** Radiant Numinous August Elder, White Emperor – Surname: *Shangjin*, Taboo Name: *Changkai*, Title: *Bai Zhaoju*.\n- **Northern Black Heaven:** Five Numinous Mysterious Elder, Black Emperor – Surname: *Heijie*, Taboo Name: *Linghui*, Title: *Ye Guangji*.\n- **Central Yellow Heaven:** Mysterious Numinous Primordial Elder, Yellow Emperor – Surname: *Tongban*, Taboo Name: *Yuancheng*, Title: *Han Shuniu*.\n\n**The Five Dippers:**\n- **East:** Horn, Neck, Root, Chamber, Heart, Tail, Winnowing Basket.\n- **South:** Well, Ghost, Willow, Star, Spread, Wings, Axletree.\n- **West:** Legs, Bond, Stomach, Hairy Head, Net, Turtle Beak, Three Stars.\n- **North:** Dipper, Ox, Girl, Emptiness, Rooftop, Encampment, Wall.\n- **Center:** Greedy Wolf, Great Gate, Salary Storage, Literary Brilliance, Integrity and Chastity, Martial Brilliance, Breaking Army.\n\n**Names and Taboo Names of the Five Heavenly Demon Kings:**\n- Blue Heaven Demon King – Surname: *Fu*, Taboo Name: *Chichengba*.\n- Red Heaven Demon King – Surname: *Fu*, Taboo Name: *Yousu*.\n- White Heaven Demon King – Surname: *Chi*, Taboo Name: *Zhangshi*.\n- Black Heaven Demon King – Surname: *Xu*, Taboo Name: *Zhishi*.\n- Yellow Heaven Demon King – Surname: *Tianmen*, Taboo Name: *Bokuang*.\n\n**Names and Taboo Names of the Five Great Demon Kings:**\n- Great Demon of the Blue Emperor – Surname: *Poluo*, Taboo Name: *Wanxing*.\n- Great Demon of the Red Emperor – Surname: *Zhe*, Taboo Name: *Shangbai*.\n- Great Demon of the White Emperor – Surname: *Deng*, Taboo Name: *Xuni*.\n- Great Demon of the Black Emperor – Surname: *Xiao*, Taboo Name: *Gongsun*.\n- Great Demon of the Yellow Emperor – Surname: *Wangong*, Taboo Name: *Chansheng*.\n\n**Governance of the Five Emperors:**\n- The Blue Emperor guards the *hun*.\n- The Red Emperor nurtures the *qi*.\n- The White Emperor attends the *po*.\n- The Black Emperor circulates the blood.\n- The Yellow Emperor, the Central Lord, commands all spirits.\n\n**Governance of the Five Dippers:**\n- The Eastern Dipper governs calculation.\n- The Southern Dipper bestows life.\n- The Western Dipper records names.\n- The Northern Dipper decrees death.",

      "translated_text": "The Flying Celestials descend in observation, the Supreme Emperor chants from afar, the myriad spirits prostrate in homage, and the Three Realms attend in reverence. Subduing the host of spirits, purifying the ten directions, the Dao perfected and merit accomplished, one serves the Three Clarities as a minister. Humbly, I, Zhang Wanfu, have annotated this fixed chapter to elucidate its meaning.\n\nThe *Mingbao Sutra* was sealed and concealed upon its descent into the world.\nThe Heavenly Worthy, in the Azure Beginning Heaven, expounded this scripture and bestowed it upon the Dao Lord. Later, in the Great Cinnabar Heaven, the Great Brahma sounds were granted. After the Dao Lord compiled its sequence, it was treasured in heaven and concealed within the Purple Tenuity Palace of the Jade Capital in the Mysterious Metropolis. Its sealing is of utmost gravity—transmitted only to the sagely. Later, the Queen Mother of the West petitioned the Heavenly Emperor to descend it for averting the calamity of the *jiashen* year, entrusting it to practitioners of the true Dao, whence it circulated among mortals. This scripture comprises the hidden hymns of the Celestial Emperors and the secret chants of the Numinous Demon Kings, revealing the kalpic fortunes of heaven and earth, the names and titles of the myriad spirits, the conjunction of yin and yang, and the generation and transformation of primordial *qi*. Its meanings cannot be fully fathomed, nor its principles fully unraveled. Those who attain enlightenment shall naturally achieve profound clarity. In heaven, it is transmitted once every forty thousand kalpas; among mortals, once every forty years. To leak or profane it lightly brings misfortune upon nine generations, condemning them to eternal servitude in the nether darkness. How can one not be cautious? How can one not be cautious! Humbly, I, Li Shaowei, have annotated this chapter to clarify its meaning.\n\nOn the Origin of the Inner Sounds\nIn the Crimson Clarity World, the Heavenly Worthy ascended the Cypress Terrace throne. At that moment, clouds and mist surged thickly for three days and nights, and the gloom of yin did not disperse. The Five Elder Thearchs prostrated before the Heavenly Worthy, saying: \"Such a sight has never been witnessed in our attendance today.\" When the Heavenly Worthy expounded the teachings, mountains and seas fell silent, and heaven and earth grew solemnly still. Yet now, in broad daylight, darkness prevails, and the celestial and human realms tremble in fear. We, your ministers, harbor doubts—we know not the reason.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy declared: \"Today, the various heavens manifest auspicious signs, and numinous responses arise spontaneously. Jade characters blaze resplendently, obscuring the light of life. Let all present close their eyes and await.\" In an instant, the celestial *qi* suddenly parted, the gloom dissolved, and five-colored radiance illuminated the ten directions. Each bore a script of numinous writing, its characters a *zhang* in size, manifesting in the void. Their brilliance dazzled, their eight corners trailing beams of light, their splendor too bright to behold.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy proclaimed to the assembled spirits: \"This is the *Lingshu of the Eight Meetings*—its characters lack fixed form, its purport profound and subtle. You would find it difficult to trace or fathom.\" Thereupon, the command was given to the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign to transcribe its characters and explicate its sounds, bestowing them upon the Dao Lord, totaling two hundred and fifty-six characters. The Dao Lord arranged them into text, calling it the *Hidden Language of the Great Brahma*. It was appended to the two subsequent chapters in sequence.\n\nThe Sovereign was one who once descended upon Mount Emei during the reign of the Yellow Emperor, imparting to him the method of the Three Ones and Five Sprouts, before ascending once more to heaven. Humbly, I have collated the *Inner Sounds Sutra* with the *Biographies of the Immortals* to annotate this chapter.\n\nCitations\nThe *Scripture of the Jade Capital Mountain* of the Most High.",
