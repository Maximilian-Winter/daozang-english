  "full_translation": "**The Golden Lotus Orthodox Daoist Lineage: *Xianyuan Portrait Transmission***\n**Scripture Title:** *The Golden Lotus Orthodox Daoist Lineage: Xianyuan Portrait Transmission*\n**One scroll.**\n**Compiled by:** Liu Zhixuan et al. in the Yuan dynasty.\n**Source of the base text:** *Zhengtong Daozang*, *Dongzhen* section, *Pǔlù* (Lineage Records) category.\n\n---\n\n**Preface to the *Golden Lotus Orthodox Daoist Lineage: Xianyuan Portrait Transmission***\nLi Quanzheng carried with him the *Quanzhen Orthodox Daoist Lineage: Xianyuan Portrait Transmission* compiled by Liu Tiansu and Xie Xichan. Upon reading it, I was deeply moved and, in reverence, composed this ode:\n\n*The Dao’s wind ascends—*\n*Green Ox crosses westward,*\n*Five-thousand words of subtle speech,*\n*The boundless Dao’s Ancestor.*\n\n*Passed down through generations,*\n*To Zhong and Lu’s age.*\n*One coin cast, two sages met—*\n*Seven lotuses, rare and bright,*\n*Constellation’s dew, sweet and pure.*\n\n*Honored at Snow Mountain,*\n*Transformations spread through the Central Realm.*\n*Though ages pass, the words endure,*\n*The Dao knows no past nor future.*\n\n*Portraits transmitted—*\n*As if heard, as if seen.*\n*Yellow Crane soars in mist,*\n*White clouds drift where?*\n*A scroll of pure script,*\n*A wisp of incense smoke.*\n\n*Heaven and earth between,*\n*Peach blossoms, flowing waters.*\n\n*Written in spring, the year Dingmao of Taiding,*\n*By the Heavenly Master’s successor, Taixuanzi,*\n*At the Hall of Mysterious Virtue.*\n\n*The Dao’s subtlety—*\n*Some things transcend scripture,*\n*Some must be conveyed through scripture.*\n*Thus this *Xianyuan Portrait Transmission* was composed.*\n\n*Only the Quanzhen Daoists,*\n*From Xuanyuan downward,*\n*Five Patriarchs, Seven Immortals,*\n*Virtue profound, power vast,*\n*Transformations reaching the Nine Realms.*\n\n*Master Qiu Changchun’s snow-capped mountain,*\n*The Dao’s wind fully revealed—*\n*This needed no scripture to transmit.*\n*Yet their auspicious deeds*\n*Were not easily traced.*\n*I often wished to compile a complete record.*\n\n*One day, I spoke this intent to Master Xie Xichan,*\n*Who rejoiced and agreed.*\n*Together, we gathered records,*\n*Examined inscriptions and steles,*\n*And over years of research,*\n*At last achieved full clarity.*\n\n*Thus, we placed the portraits first,*\n*Appended the transmissions,*\n*And named it the *Quanzhen Orthodox Daoist Lineage: Xianyuan Portrait Transmission*.*\n\n*Let those of like mind who read it*\n*Seek what can be transmitted*\n*And grasp what cannot—*\n*Then this work shall not be without merit.*\n*Should there remain omissions,*\n*I hope others will instruct me further.*\n\n*Written on the Yang Zhi Day of the year Bingyin, Taiding,*\n*By the Daoist Liu Zhixuan of Qingxi, Mount Lu.*\n\n---\n\n**The Golden Lotus Orthodox Daoist Lineage: Xianyuan Portrait Transmission**\n\n**Edict of Yuan Taizu Chenggis Khan Summoning Master Qiu the Immortal**\n\n*The Emperor said:*\n*\"Heaven favors the Central Plains,*\n*And I, dwelling in the Northern Wilderness,*\n*Have extinguished all desires,*\n*Returning to simplicity,*\n*Rejecting excess, embracing frugality.*\n*Each meal and garment*\n*Shared with oxherds and horsemen,*\n*My people treated as my own children,*\n*Scholars as my brothers.*\n*I seek harmony,*\n*Nurture virtue,*\n*And lead the masses,*\n*Never placing myself before them,*\n*Nor lagging behind in battle.*\n\n*In seven years, great deeds were accomplished,*\n*The Four Quarters united under one rule.*\n*This was not my virtue alone,*\n*But the will of Heaven,*\n*For the age’s governance was unstable.*\n*Thus, I received Heaven’s mandate,*\n*Ascended the throne,*\n*Subdued the Southern Song,*\n*Pacified the Khitans,*\n*And all the Eastern Xia and Western barbarians bowed as vassals.*\n*Never in a thousand generations of the Xiongnu state*\n*Has this been seen.*\n\n*Yet the burden of rule is heavy,*\n*And though peace prevails,*\n*I fear neglect.*\n*Just as one carves an oar to cross the river,*\n*Or selects ministers to govern the land,*\n*Since my ascension,*\n*I have diligently attended to affairs,*\n*Yet the Three Excellencies remain unfilled.*\n\n*I inquired about Master Qiu,*\n*Whose body embodies the Dao,*\n*Whose footsteps follow the Rule,*\n*Whose knowledge is vast and profound,*\n*Whose wisdom penetrates the depths of things,*\n*Whose virtue is boundless,*\n*Whose demeanor is that of an ancient sage,*\n*Whose conduct is that of a true adept.*\n*For years, he has dwelled in seclusion,*\n*Hiding his form in the mountains,*\n*Reviving the Ancestors’ teachings,*\n*And gathering Daoists of the Way.*\n*His collection of Daoist scriptures*\n*Is beyond count.*\n\n*Though war has ended,*\n*I know he still hides in his old mountain retreat.*\n*My heart reveres him without end.*\n*Have I not heard of*\n*The same carriage on the Wei River,*\n*The three visits to the thatched hut?*\n*Yet mountains and rivers lie between us,*\n*And I cannot personally welcome him.*\n\n*I have only withdrawn from court,*\n*Purified my body and mind,*\n*And sent my attendant Liu Zhonglu*\n*With a modest carriage and light escort,*\n*Not sparing the thousand-mile journey,*\n*To humbly invite Master Qiu*\n*To descend from his lofty steps.*\n*Whether he speaks of*\n*The people’s welfare*\n*Or my own preservation,*\n*I will attend him personally,*\n*And even a single word from his coughing lips*\n*Would suffice.*\n\n*Now, I merely express my earnest hope*\n*In this edict,*\n*That Master Qiu may*\n*Reveal the essentials of the Great Dao,*\n*And fulfill even the smallest wishes of all beings.*\n\n*Issued on the first day of the fifth month.*\n\n---\n\n**Praise and Enfeoffment by Yuan Shizu (Kublai Khan)**\n\n*The Emperor said:*\n*\"The Dao, when illuminated,*\n*Leads to effortless transformation.*\n*The Absolute Truth, when nurtured,*\n*Accomplishes what cannot be governed.*\n\n*I, inheriting the foundations of my ancestors,*\n*Have long admired the Mysterious Wind.*\n*From the Eastern Peak’s teachings*\n*To Master Zhongyang’s revelations,*\n*The True and Pure have never faded,*\n*And each generation has carried it forward.*\n*Where there is feeling, communication follows,*\n*And no distance is too great to reach.*\n\n*Though past emperors bestowed honors,*\n*In my heart, I still feel they were insufficient.*\n*Thus, I command the scholars*\n*To further elevate their titles.*\n*Since the Eastern Peak is already called the Imperial Sovereign,*\n*Let him be granted the title of ‘Minor Yang of the Purple Bureau.’*\n*The True Lords of Zhengyang, Chunyang, Haichan, and Zhongyang*\n*Shall be ennobled as ‘True Princes.’*\n*The seven True Persons of Danyang and below*\n*Shall all be titled ‘True Immortals,’*\n*Recorded in the registers,*\n*And passed down through the ages.*\n\n*Ah!*\n*Zhang Daoling of the Han*\n*And Yi Fasuan of the Tang*\n*Both received the title of ‘Heavenly Master,’*\n*Becoming eternal honors for the Dao.*\n*In their time, no dissent was heard,*\n*And later, it became a fixed institution.*\n*This is what I aspire to—*\n*Perhaps I may come close.\"*\n\nThe Eastern Peak Dao Master may be ennobled as **Eastern Peak Purple Bureau Minor Yang Emperor**.\n\nThe **Zhongli True Person of Zhengyang** may be ennobled as **Zhengyang Enlightening Transmission of the Way True Lord**.\n\nThe **Pure-Hearted Lü True Person** may be ennobled as **Pure Yang Rectifying and Warning the Transformation True Lord**.\n\nThe **Haichan Liu True Person** may be ennobled as **Haichan Illuminating Enlightenment and Expounding the Way True Lord**.\n\nThe **Zhongyang Wang True Person** may be ennobled as **Zhongyang Complete Perfection and Enlightening the Transformation True Lord**.\n\nThe **Danyang Master Ma Dan** may be ennobled as **Danyang Embracing Unity and Non-Action True Person**.\n\nThe **Changzhen Master Tan Chuduan** may be ennobled as **Changzhen Cloud-and-Water Nurturing Virtue True Person**.\n\nThe **Changsheng Master Liu Chuxuan** may be ennobled as **Changsheng Aiding Transformation and Illuminating Virtue True Person**.\n\nThe **Changchun Master Qiu Chuji** may be ennobled as **Changchun Performing the Way and Teaching the Dao True Lord**.\n\nThe **Yuyang Master Wang Chuyi** may be ennobled as **Yuyang Manifesting the Mysterious and Broadly Guiding True Person**.\n\nThe **Guangning Master Hao Datong** may be ennobled as **Guangning Communing with the Mysterious and Ancient True Person**.\n\nThe **Qingjing Scattered Person Sun Bu’er** may be ennobled as **Qingjing Profoundly Upright and Harmonizing Virtue True Person**.\n\nIt is proper that **Zhang Zhijie, the Sincere and Illuminating True Person Who Upholds the Dao**, shall execute this decree.\n\nThis is hereby approved.\n\n**至元六年正月日**\nBy decree of the **Wu Zong Emperor**, the **Heavenly Mandate of the Emperor of Divine Favor**:\n\nThe **Sanxuan Teaching** was ordained by Heaven, now encompassing all spirits, its five-hundred-year lineage flourishing in the proper order of the age. In days of old, the **East华 Emperor** of the **Taichen Palace** sustained an unbroken lineage unknown in its beginning and end, with **qi** vast and boundless, its mysteries beyond measure. Detached from form and trace, yet naturally so, it brings fortune and auspice without utterance, transmitted to the **August Sovereign**, this is the **Quanzhen Way**.\n\nTo uphold the One, abide in harmony—without seeking, yet without reliance—ascending the **Red Lacquer and Azure Rainbow**, circling the **Tortoise Diagram and Unicorn Talisman**, its law enduring through cataclysm, its successors emerging as **Highly True Ones**. The ancient **Guest Teachers** now manifest as the **Bright and Pure**, compassionate and courageous, supremely filial and chaste, their resolve unshaken before winter’s test. Their words are fulfilled; in matters of assembly, their foresight extends to the warmth already bestowed upon their persons, their sincerity in repaying roots ever deeper. Thus, gracious edicts descend, titles bestowed in proper order.\n\nVerily, when **Divine and Human** harmonize, the **Way of Kings** is balanced—let this be proclaimed far and wide. When **Teaching and Transformation** prevail, governance is established—let this be preserved eternally.\n\nIt is decreed to ennoble the **East华 Emperor of the Purple Bureaucracy, Auxiliary of the Primordial, Founder of the Pole**—let the responsible authorities execute this.\n\n---\n\n**至大三年二月日**\nBy decree of the **Heavenly Mandate of the Emperor of Divine Favor**:\n\nIt is said that the **August Sovereign** expounded the **Quanzhen Teaching**, aligning with the eternal principles of Heaven and Earth, following the great order of Yin and Yang. It began with the **East华 Transformation**, concluding with the **Kaiyuan Bestowal of Green Decrees**, from Han to Tang, producing **Aged Ones of the Age** at intervals. With Jin succeeding Song, during the **Xichao Dynasty**, the **Dao lineage** shone forth, its myriad mysteries unfolded, its foundation in the **Nameless Primordial**. Some attained **meaning beyond form**, nurturing themselves in the **Spiritual Pivot**; others **rode dragons and stars**, soaring in the **Purple Extremity**. Unheard, unseen—though consorting with the **Creator**, they came and went in quietude, yet their responses aligned with the times.\n\nThus, their deeds were recorded for posterity, their virtues praised as **Jade Leaves** of **Original Merit**. Let their ranks be properly elevated, that the **doctrinal wind** may endure forever.\n\nExcept for the **First Ancestor, East华 Emperor**, whose honors shall be separately deliberated, the rest shall be executed uniformly by the responsible authorities.\n\nThe **Zhongli True Lord of Zhengyang Enlightenment and Dao Transmission** may be ennobled as the **Zhengyang Emperor of Enlightenment, Dao Transmission, and Instruction**.\n\nThe **Lü True Lord of Chunyang Correcting the Dao and Warning the World** may be ennobled as the **Chunyang Emperor of Correcting the Dao, Warning the World, and Auspicious Aid**.\n\nThe **Liu True Lord of Haitan Enlightenment, Dao Expansion, and Pure Aid** may be ennobled as the **Haitan Emperor of Enlightenment, Dao Expansion, and Supreme Aid**.\n\nThe **Wang True Lord of Chongyang Quanzhen Transformation** may be ennobled as the **Chongyang Emperor of Quanzhen Transformation and Auxiliary of the Pole**.\n\nThis is entrusted to the **Great Dao Master of the Dao Transmission, the Rectifying and Pure True Person of Concentrated Harmony, Miao Dao-yi**, to receive and execute. Approved thus.\n\n---\n\n**至大三年二月日**\nBy decree of the **Heavenly Mandate of the Emperor of Divine Favor**:\n\nWhen Heaven first formed the **Grass Muddle**, only the **Noble Ones** wove its threads. In an age of **Sagely Prosperity**, the **Aged Ones** upheld and guarded it. In days of old, when our **August Ancestor** established the foundation in the **Northern Lands**, a **True Immortal** manifested in the **Eastern Quarter**, acting without obstruction, knowing all under Heaven, his learning profound, exhausting all scriptures. His urgent priority was to rescue the people from the abyss; his first concern was to clear the thorns of the Dao. Though his self-discipline was strict, his benefit to all was vast.\n\nWhen the **Silken Edicts** descended in succession, the **Cloud-Capped Ones** followed, leading eighteen **Exemplary and Common** souls. Their words encompassed more than one matter of **State and Lineage**; their hearts in silent accord, like **Huangdi’s** teacher **Guangcheng**, their speech concise yet profound, like **Han Wen’s** riverbank meeting. Having achieved success for the **Chinese**, they were entrusted with **Longchun Teaching**. Those who followed in their likeness attained the **True**, thus it is said: *\"May the sun’s brilliance endure, prolonging the **Hong** lineage’s fortune, as the **Present Rectifiers**.\"* To revive the **Dao Gate** anew—all are one in this.\n\nNow, in this time, **abundant rewards** are bestowed; past and present are not two principles.\n\nIt is fitting to advance their titles in posthumous honor, that their **rules** may endure eternally.\n\nThe **Longchun True Lord of Dao Performance and Teaching, Qiu Chuji**, may be ennobled as the **Longchun True Lord of Complete Virtue, Divine Transformation, Illuminating Response**—let the responsible authorities execute this.\n\n---\n\n**至大三年二月日**\nBy decree of the **Heavenly Mandate of the Emperor of Divine Favor**:\n\nAssisting in **One Virtue**, Heaven reveals its thoughts. Seven founders—**the Dao’s practice**—like the **Pivot Star** governing the **Primordial Axis**, like the **Gnomon and Level** aligning with **Divine Instruments**. Whose sons? **Icons of the Emperor’s Forebears**, exhausting the mysteries of **Laozi and Guan Yin**, yet without action, they **self-so transformed**, questioning **Donglai and Xishan**.\n\nSome withdrew into the **dustly world**; others dwelled in **humble walls**. When the **Royal Yuan Dynasty’s** fortunes arose, they personally received the **August Ancestor’s** favor. Their **exalted strategies** unfolded as **salvation for the age**; their **Dao mechanisms** transcended, consorting with Heaven. None failed to exhaust the **depths of teacher and friend**; all had already ascended to the **Dawn of the Celestial Morning**, expounding the **ancient rules** anew, multiplying as **guests in the imperial halls**. Their **profound talents and learning** were inherited—now, the **Divine Chess** is presented. Let their **visible ranks** be elevated to enrich the **True Wind**.\n\nExcept for the **Longchun Teaching Master Qiu**, whose honors shall be separately proclaimed, the rest shall be executed uniformly by the responsible authorities.\n\nThe **True Person of Danyang Embracing the One and Non-Action, Ma Dan** may be ennobled as the **Dan Emperor of Embracing the One, Non-Action, and Universal Transformation**.\n\nThe **True Person of Changsheng Cloud-Water Nurturing Virtue, Tan Chuzhuan** may be ennobled as the **Changsheng True Lord of Concentrated Spirit, Mysterious Tranquility, and Nurturing Virtue**.\n\nThe **True Person of Changsheng Auxiliary Transformation and Illuminating Virtue, Liu Chuxuan** may be ennobled as the **Changsheng True Lord of Auxiliary Transformation, Foundational Mystery, and Illuminating Virtue**.\n\nThe **True Person of Yuyang Manifesting the Mysterious and Broadly Guiding, Wang Chuyi** may be ennobled as the **Yuyang True Lord of Manifesting the Mysterious, Broad Compassion, and Universal Guidance**.\n\nThe **True Person of Guangning Communing with the Dao of the Primordial Age, He Datong**, may be ennobled as the **Guangning True Lord of Communing with the Dao, Marvelous Extremes, and the Primordial Age**.\n\nThe **True Person of Pure Quiet, Profound Integrity, and Harmonizing Virtue, Sun Bu’er**, may be ennobled as the **True Lord of Pure Quiet, Profound Integrity, Mysterious Emptiness, and Harmonizing Transformation**.\n\nThe above is entrusted to the **Grand Master of the Dao Gate, Master of Teaching, Concentrated Harmony, Upholding Rectitude, and Illuminating Purity, Miao Dao’yī**, to execute accordingly. Issued on the second month, Zhida era, the third year.\n\n**Imperial Edict of the Heavenly Mandate Emperor:**\n\nThe ancients have said: To exhaust loyalty to one’s sovereign, to fulfill filial piety toward one’s parents, to return sincerity to Heaven, to bestow benevolence upon the people—those who possess talent to aid governance and learning to enrich others may be ranked among the Celestial Worthies, and their Dao may flourish in the present age.\n\nThe **True Person of Pure Harmony, Marvelous Dao, and Broad Transformation, Yin Zhiping**, bears a divine spirit and boundless breadth, with a noble and austere bearing. Though clad in coarse robes, he is not emaciated like the recluses of mountain and marsh; though adorned in courtly attire, he is not ostentatious like the ministers of the hall. He responds to all things with effortless spontaneity, swift as if following the loom’s threads yet enduring as the eternal. Entering the Hall of Long Life, he still teaches as the Master of Long Life; embodying the True Form of Supreme Extremes, he perfectly aligns with it. He demonstrates the true principles to the four quarters, receiving the rites and favor of the three courts.\n\nNow, having a worthy successor, he has restored the sacred steps of the Dao. Let extraordinary honors be bestowed upon him to elevate his title.\n\nAh! The weak waters of Penglai return without need of boats and carriages, and auspicious clouds linger like the flying banner of the Yellow Emperor. Let him be ennobled as the **Grand True Person of Pure Harmony, Marvelous Use, Broad Transformation, and Venerable Teaching**, and the responsible officials shall carry it out. Issued on the second month, Zhida era, the third year.\n\n**Imperial Edict of the Heavenly Mandate Emperor:**\n\nThe orthodox lineage of Dao and Virtue has been passed down through worthy descendants, and the most profound learning has emerged from the radiant court.\n\nThe **True Person of Eternal Constant, Supreme Virtue, and Propagating Teaching, Li Zhichang**, shines with refined words and surpasses others in conduct. His writings surpass the elegance of *Zhuangzi*’s parables, and his divine responses transcend the limits of sight and hearing. Uncarved like the pure jade, his actions do not suppress the extraordinary; his sincerity is unadulterated, his essence boundless. How can he be named? How can he be surpassed?\n\nLet his eminent realm be proclaimed, and let special honors be conferred upon him, to illuminate the flourishing lineage of the Complete Perfection and to comfort the repeated petitions of the worthy teacher.\n\nAh! His fame resounds like the treasures of the *Baojian*, and he succeeds the *Taichen* Lord across countless eons. His brilliance shines like the spring flowers, and he inherits the *Chengming* Sage through two generations.\n\nLet him be ennobled as the **Grand True Person of Eternal Constant, Marvelous Response, Manifested Literature, and Comprehensive Salvation**, and the responsible officials shall carry it out. Issued on the second month, Zhida era, the third year.\n\n**Imperial Edict of the Heavenly Mandate Emperor:**\n\nThe Way is called the \"Non-Action,\" and nothing is more precious than a just name.\n\nIndeed, the virtuous model of Qingyi is admired by all, yet his refined and dignified bearing is not merely for show. His deeds are already evident in his lifetime, and the rites should now be bestowed with imperial favor.\n\nThe **True Person of Communing with the Dao, Propagating Teaching, and Piercing the Clouds, Song Defang**, early awakened to the mysterious principles and exhaustively explored the esoteric arts. He purified his heart, untainted by petty concerns, and embraced the vast transformation without boasting of minor virtues. His virtue is complete, yet his talent remains unshowy; his capacity is boundless, yet he obstructs nothing. Leading the Celestial Worthies and governing the True Lords, all praise him as a treasure at the feast. Riding the swift winds, he traverses Kunlun; his movements align with the cosmic cycles. Granting his request, let his essence be honored.\n\nAh! His merits exceed the years, and he follows the mighty strides of *Gengsang*. His spirit is concentrated, and nothing is impaired; he embodies the abundant harvests of *Gushan*.\n\nLet him be ennobled as the **Grand True Person of the Mysterious Capital, Supreme Dao, Venerable Literature, and Illuminating Transformation**, and the responsible officials shall carry it out.\n\nIn the third year of the Zhi Da era, the second month, the Emperor, by Heaven’s favor and mandate, issued an imperial edict:\n\n*\"From the sage reigns of Tang and Yu, there emerged the grand patterns for enduring governance. The worthy ministers of Ji and Yi were indeed chosen to ascend to the celestial realm, for Heaven does not create talent in vain, nor does the Dao’s transmission rest upon the unworthy. In days past, the Venerable Long Spring [Zhuangzi] encountered the Sage Emperor, and the divine scrolls were bestowed upon the Eastern lands, while the swift chariot circled in the Western campaign. Whether before or behind, left or right, their resolve was steadfast—soaring above frost and ice to wander the Celestial Purity, their writings illuminated, their jade and zither upright, their rectitude unshaken. Their profound works stood firm, their teachings grew ever brighter, and thus we honor the green-scripted decrees and uphold the ancient red-barrier traditions.\n\nAh! The auspicious dragon and phoenix ascend in their merit, and the crimson realm’s mysteries cluster in the clouds—favors unmatched, their deeds inscribed in the sacred records. Let their exalted titles be bestowed and their glory endure.\n\nLet the officials deliberate on the promotions of the following: Yin Qinghe, Song Pi’yun, and Li Zhenchang, with the rest following precedent. Zhao Daojian shall be ennobled as the **True Person of Loyal Integrity, the Radiant Dao-Master of the Orthodox Teaching**. Song Da’an shall be ennobled as the **True Person of Primordial Clarity, Universal Illumination, and Exalted Virtue**. Xia Zhicheng shall be ennobled as the **True Person of Non-Action, Embracing the Dao, and Substantial Virtue**. Wang Zhiming shall be ennobled as the **True Person of Auspicious Spirit, Dao’s Resource, and Preserved Light**. Sun Zhijian shall be ennobled as the **True Person of Illuminated Sincerity, Embodied Mystery, and Void Tranquility**. Yu Zhike shall be ennobled as the **True Person of Sincere Purity, Restored Simplicity, and Boundless Void**. Zhang Zhisu shall be ennobled as the **True Person of Responding to Verdant Teaching, Exalted Dao, and Illuminating Transformation**. Zheng Zhixiu shall be ennobled as the **True Person of Penetrating Subtlety, Restored Stillness, and Boundless Response**. Ju Zhiyuan shall be ennobled as the **True Person of Preserving Truth, Substantial Simplicity, and Tranquil Response**. Meng Zhishen shall be ennobled as the **True Person of Profound Mystery, Broad Virtue, and Boundless Application**. Zhang Zhiyuan shall be ennobled as the **True Person of Awakened Truth, Concentrated Transformation, and Pure Substance**. Jing Zhiyuan shall be ennobled as the **True Person of Embodied Primordial, Cherished Virtue, and Boundless Awakening**. He Zhijing shall be ennobled as the **True Person of Void Clarity, Profound Stillness, and Guarding the One**. Yang Zhijing shall be ennobled as the **True Person of Piercing Void, Attaining the One, and Mysterious Passage**. Pan Dechong shall be ennobled as the **True Person of Piercing Mystery, Marvelous Dao, and Boundless Harmony**.\n\nThis decree is entrusted to the Great Dao-Master of the Perfected Way, the Rectifying and Illuminating True Person of Concentrated Harmony, Master Miao Dao-yi, to execute accordingly. Issued on the second month, third year of Zhi Da.*\n\n---\n\nIn days of old, the Ancestral Master, the Venerable Long Spring Qiu True Lord, embraced the Dao and cherished virtue, retreating deeply into Donglai. The Founding Emperor, upon hearing of his renown, summoned him from afar to the snowy mountains, bestowing upon him honors most exalted, and thus the Dao’s winds flourished anew. When the World-Conquering Emperor unified the realm, he further revered him, and the Five Ancestors and Seven Worthies were all granted illustrious titles. The Martial Emperor further ennobled him as the **Celestial Sovereign and True Lord**, and the Eighteen Great Masters were universally bestowed the rank of True Person—truly a matchless event in history. Though the peaks of Kongtong resounded with Daoist inquiries and the Yellow River’s banks echoed with sutra debates, who could surpass such splendor in antiquity?\n\nYour servant, Zhi Xuan, born in this prosperous age and unworthy of scholarly robes, recently served as disciple to the Great Dao-Master of Opening the Mysteries, True Person Sun, at the Great Long Spring Palace in the capital. There, I beheld the decrees of the Sage Emperors and, with reverence, transcribed them to share with all under Heaven, that all may witness the Emperor’s profound reverence for the Dao.\n\nOn the fifteenth day of the first month, Tai Ding era, the Purple-Gated High Sage of Clarified Void, Profound Tranquility, and Piercing Illumination, your servant Liu Zhi Xuan, prostrates and kneels in homage at the end of this scroll.\n\n---\n\n**The Primordial Sage, Laozi**\nLaozi, surnamed Li, given name Er, with the courtesy name Qing, hailed from Qu Ren Village, Lei Xiang, Ku County. His mother conceived for eighty-one years and gave birth in the ninth year of Yin’s King Wu Ding, on the fifteenth day of the second month, in the year of *Gengchen*.\n\nAt birth, his hair and beard were as white as snow, hence the world called him Laozi, and he was said to have taken Li (plum tree) as his surname. Through the reigns of Yin and Zhou, he was invited by King Wen to serve as Keeper of the Archives, and after King Wu’s conquest of Yin, he was transferred to the post of Historiographer. During King Zhao’s reign, he journeyed westward into the flowing sands, and by the time of King You, he had returned to the Central Plains.\n\nConfucius once inquired of him about ritual. Laozi told Confucius: *\"A noble who finds his time will ride in splendor; if not, he will walk with humility. I have heard that a wise merchant probes the depths like the void, and a man of virtue, though his deeds are great, appears as though simple. This is all I have to say to you.\"* Confucius withdrew and said to his disciples: *\"I know how birds fly and fish swim and beasts run. The runner can be the leader, the swimmer the net, the flier the hook—but as for the dragon, I cannot know how it rides the winds and clouds to ascend to Heaven. Today, I have seen Laozi—perhaps he is like the dragon.\"*\n\nSeeing the decline of Zhou, Laozi departed. At Hangu Pass, the gatekeeper Yin Xi, skilled in divining by *qi*, saw a purple vapor rising over the pass and knew a sage had arrived. When Laozi, driving a green ox-cart westward, approached, Yin Xi begged: *\"Master, you are about to depart—grant me the strength to record your teachings.\"* Thus Laozi composed the *Dao De Jing* in two sections, over five thousand words, and gave it to Yin Xi before vanishing. No one knows his end.\n\nToday, the Tai Qing Palace in Bozhou marks his birthplace, and the Zongsheng Palace in Zhongnan Mountain, Jingzhao, is where he transmitted the sutras in ancient Louguan.\n\nLaozi is the manifestation of the **Supreme Old Lord of Tai Qing**. Emperor Gaozong of Tang bestowed upon him the title **Supreme Primordial Emperor**, Emperor Xuanzong elevated him to **Most High Ancestor, Supreme Dao, Primordial Emperor**, and Emperor Zhenzong of Song honored him as **Supreme Old Lord, Primordial Emperor of Boundless Virtue**.\n\n**Eulogy:**\n*\"In days of old, the Piercing Spirit, transmitted through twelve generations,\nThe white deer came from the east, the green ox departed to the west.\"*\n\nThe Dao follows its own nature—mysterious beyond measure.\nThe formless form, prior to earth and heaven.\n\n**The East华 Emperor**—his surname is Wang, his given name unknown, and the annals of geography offer no further detail.\nHe received the Supreme Dao, secluding himself at Kunjian Mountain, and was known as the East华 Emperor.\nLater, he resided in the Purple Palace Cavernous Realm of Wutai Mountain, sometimes called the Purple Palace Minor Yang Lord.\nSubsequently, he manifested at the Jingyang Cavern of Zhongnan Mountain, transmitting the Dao to Zhongli Zi.\n\nAccording to *The Gleanings from Immortal Transmissions*, the Emperor was the primordial *qi* of Qingyang, the first among all deities.\nHe dwelled in the Palace of Great Dawn, with purple clouds as his canopy and green clouds as his walls.\nWith ten billion celestial officials, he registered the ranks of immortals, reporting to Laozi by divine decree.\nThe surname \"Wang\" is an honorific of supreme nobility, not his true clan.\n\nThus, the saying holds true.\n\nThe Yuan Emperor Shizu bestowed upon him the title **East华 Purple Palace Minor Yang Emperor**, and Emperor Wuzong of the Tang further elevated him to **East华 Purple Palace Emperor Who Supports the Primordial and Establishes the Pole**.\n\n**Eulogy:**\n*\"The Dao succeeds the Primordial Mysterious—\nTeaching spreads across the land.\nHeaven nears Kunlun, clouds stretch across the Purple Palace.\nGod among gods, True among Trues.\nLong life has its path—\nPassed down to future generations.\"*\n\n**Zhengyang Zi**—his surname was Zhongli, given name Quan, courtesy name Yunfang, and his appellation was Zhengyang Zi.\nA native of Xianyang, Jingzhao, his bearing was majestic, his scholarship encompassing both civil and martial arts.\nEight feet seven inches tall, his beard extended past his waist, and his eyes radiated divine light.\nHe served the Han as a general, but after a military defeat, he retreated into Zhongnan Mountain, where he encountered the East华 Emperor, who transmitted to him the supreme Dao.\n\nLater, he secluded himself in **Yinzhou’s** Yangjiao Mountain, cutting no ties with the worldly. His hair grew long in twin braids, and he wore robes of hemp leaves, calling himself **\"Universal Scatterer of Han.\"**\n\nWhen his Dao was perfected, the **Celestial True** bestowed upon him the title **\"True Person of the Left Palace of the Supreme Pole.\"** He soared among mortals, manifesting in fleeting forms—often encountered by the worldly.\n\nThere was a eulogy that read:\n*\"The gate that birthed me is my tomb’s door—\nHow many wakeful ones, how many enlightened?\nLast night, the iron man pondered deeply—\nLong life and immortality lie in one’s own hands.\"*\n\nHis poems and writings circulated in the world.\n\nToday, the **Congee Yang Cave Transmission Hall** in **Zhongnan Mountain**—where he met the **East Hua Emperor**—and the **Zhengyang Palace** in **Zhouqu Bay, Xianyang**, his former residence, stand as testament.\n\nThe **Emperor Shizu of the Yuan Dynasty** conferred upon him the title **\"True Lord Zhengyang, Opener of Enlightenment, Transmitter of the Dao.\"** The **Emperor Wuzong** further elevated him to **\"True Lord Zhengyang, Opener of Enlightenment, Transmitter of the Dao, and Bestower of Teachings.\"**\n\n**Eulogy:**\n*\"Early met the East Hua—\nThe Dao was shared between us.\nSun and moon as twin braids,\nHeaven and Earth as hemp-leaf robes.\nFlowers bloom from jade buds,\nTrees grow with leaden branches.\nEndless the Luo waters,\nJust as they were then.\"*\n\n**Pure Yang Zi**\n\n**Master Lü** bore the surname **Lü** and given name **Yan**, with the courtesy name **Dòngbīn** and sobriquet **Pure Yang Zi**, hailing from **Zhào Xiān Village, Yǒnglè Town, Pújì County, Pú Prefecture**—born on the **fourteenth day of the fourth month, in the year Zhenyuan of Emperor Dezong of the Tang Dynasty (786 CE)**.\n\nAt the age of twenty, he passed the **imperial examinations** and earned the **Jìnshì degree**, though he had not yet been assigned an official post. In the spring, while wandering along the **Luo River**, he encountered **Pure Yang Zi**, who transmitted to him the **Dao of the Immortals**. Later, he secluded himself on **Lúshān Mountain** to cultivate and refine his essence, thereafter wandering among the people. He often called himself a **\"Returning Daoist\"**—sometimes hidden, sometimes revealed—leaving the world unable to fathom him.\n\nHe once composed:\n*\"Seizing the golden essence as the foundation of life,\nThe sun’s spirit to the east, the moon’s radiance to the west.\nWithin, I forged the elixir of eternal youth—\nOnce consumed, I stand equal to Heaven and Earth.\"*\n\nHe also taught **Lu Dongbin** in an inn by **Nàguō**, passing down knowledge through a pillow, and inscribed verses on the walls of **Shěn Ji’s** eastern neighbor’s home with **lotus root bark**, leaving behind countless divine traces recorded in scriptures.\n\nThose who speak of immortals and transcendence invariably revere **Zhōnglü**, and wherever he passed, shrines were erected in his honor. His collected poems and verses, known as the *Húnchéng Collection*, circulated in the world.\n\nToday, the **Great Pure Yang Hall of Ten Thousand Years** in **Yǒnglè Town** stands as his former residence. The **Emperor Shizu of the Yuan Dynasty** conferred upon him the title **\"Pure Yang Perfected and Rectified, Awakening and Transforming True Lord.\"** The **Emperor Wuzong** further elevated him to **\"Pure Yang Perfected and Rectified, Awakening and Transforming, Auspicious and Benevolent True Lord.\"**\n\n**Eulogy:**\n*\"A single sword cleaves autumn’s chill—\nCool winds in both sleeves.\nThe Dao is swift as three strides,\nThe elixir turns ninefold.\nPángwū to the Northern Sea,\nWhite clouds, the realm of the Immortal Sovereign.\nA drop from the Sweet River’s source—\nFlows long and deep.\"*\n\n---\n\n**Master Sì** bore the surname **Liú** and given name **Cāo**, with the courtesy name **Zōngchéng** and sobriquet **Hǎi Chán Zi**, a native of **Yànshān**.\n\nAt sixteen, he passed the **highest imperial examination of the Liao Dynasty** and rose to the position of **Grand Chancellor**. Enamored with the study of **nature and life**, yet still unenlightened, he suddenly received a **Daoist adept** who came to pay his respects. Master Sì entertained him with guestly courtesy and inquired after his name, but the adept remained silent, instead requesting **ten parrot eggs** and **a gold coin**. Placing the coin atop the eggs, he shook the bag ten times without a single egg falling. Master Sì sighed, *\"Perilous indeed!\"*\n\nThe adept replied, *\"Your life and fate are both in peril—far worse than this.\"*\n\nMaster Sì pressed further: *\"How then does one escape peril?\"*\n\nThe adept gathered the eggs, cast the gold coin to the ground, and laughed before departing. That night, Master Sì attained sudden enlightenment. He shattered his treasures in celebration, resigned his chancellor’s seal the next day, donned Daoist robes, and feigned madness with song and dance before wandering into **Qínchuān**.\n\nThere, he encountered the same adept again, who this time transmitted the **elixir’s secret precepts**—revealing himself as **Pure Yang Zi**.\n\nMaster Sì once wrote:\n*\"Abandoning the fiery abode of three thousand souls,\nDismantling the gate guards of ten thousand households.\"*\n\nAnd in a longer ode:\n*\"Drunk on a white donkey’s back I ride,\nA copper cauldron’s tail I swing behind.\nA blue-eyed slave I lead,\nA lone, lean beard I bear.\nForgotten are the world’s affairs,\nMy home is at **Ge Hong’s Well**.\nUnread the *Huángtíng Scripture*,\nNor do I tend the **Dragon-Tiger Cauldron**.\nStanding alone in the city’s heart,\nI refuse the pleading of the vulgar.\nTo wield the **Thunderbolt Lute** I yearn,\nAnd climb the peaks of **Kunlun’s** spire.\nTen **Hàoniú horns** I buy,\nHalf an acre of riverside land I till.\nPlanting millet, brewing white wine—\nThis is the realm of the Immortals.\nDrunk beneath ancient pine’s shade,\nLeaning idle on the White Cloud Ridge.\nWhen I depart, I go at once,\nVanishing into autumn’s mist.\"*\n\nLater, he transmitted the **mysteries of the Dao** to **Dònggōng Níngyáng** and **Zhāng Zǐyáng**, then vanished between **Zhōngnán** and **Tàihuá Mountains**, his end unknown. His poems and writings endured in the world.\n\nThe **Emperor Shizu of the Yuan Dynasty** conferred upon him the title **\"Hǎi Chán Enlightened and Clarifying, Expounding the Dao True Lord.\"** The **Emperor Wuzong** further elevated him to **\"Hǎi Chán Enlightened and Clarifying, Expounding the Dao, Auspicious and Benevolent True Lord.\"**\n\n**Eulogy:**\n*\"Boldly casting off the golden peacock’s cape,\nResigning the chancellor’s seal with force.\nA strange encounter in **Qínchuān’s** lands,\nA lofty seclusion in **Zhōngnán’s** heights.\"*\n\nThe black crow flies, the hare races,\nThe tiger lies low, the dragon descends.\nA single cup of immortal wine,\nReserved for the Double Ninth.\n\n**Master Zhòngyáng**—surname **Wáng**, given name **Jiā**—\nInitially named **Zhòngfú**, with the courtesy name **Yǔnqīng**,\nLater renamed **Shìxióng**, with the courtesy name **Déwēi**,\nBefore entering the Dao and adopting his present name and title.\nA native of **Dàwèi Village, Xiányáng**.\n\nHis mother bore him after twenty-four months,\nOn the twenty-second day of the twelfth month,\nIn the **Rénchén year of the Zhènghé era of Emperor Huizong of the Song Dynasty**.\n\nAt first, he was called **Zhòngfú**, with the courtesy name **Yǔnqīng**,\nThen renamed **Shìxióng**, with the courtesy name **Déwēi**,\nAnd later, upon entering the Dao, took his present name and title.\n\nThe Master had a fine beard and mustache,\nHis eyes larger than his mouth,\nHis stature over six *chǐ* in height,\nHis **qi** bold, his speech persuasive, his strength surpassing others.\nHe mastered the classics and histories,\nAnd excelled in horsemanship and archery.\n\nWhen the Central Plains fell into turmoil,\nAnd **Qín-Lǒng** was in chaos,\nThe Master often harbored a desire to transcend the mundane,\nAnd so relocated to **Liú-Jiāng Village, Zhōngnán County**,\nEstablishing a separate dwelling where he dwelled in seclusion,\nNeglecting all household affairs,\nLiving freely and at ease.\nHe often said:\n*\"Five days ago, Páng Rúshì—\nNow it’s Wáng Hàifēng.\"*\n\nIn the **Jǐmǎo year of the Jìn Zhènglóng era**,\nOn the **wǎnrì** of the sixth month,\nWithin a tavern in **Gānhé Town, Zhōngnán County**,\nHe encountered two men,\nBoth with disheveled hair and wearing coarse wool garments,\nTheir ages and appearances identical.\nThe Master, struck by their unusual demeanor,\nImmediately paid them homage with reverence.\nThey spoke slowly:\n*\"This child may be taught.\"*\nAnd secretly transmitted to him the **mysteries of the Dao**.\n\nThe Master composed a verse in praise:\n*\"At forty-eight, I first met them—\nThe oral precepts passed, my merit began.\nA single grain of golden elixir, its hue refined,\nOn **Yùhuá Peak**, its crimson glow revealed.\"*\n\nThose he encountered were none other than **Lǚ Chúnxiáng**.\n\nThe following year, in the **Gēngchén year**,\nOn the **Mid-Autumn Festival**,\nHe met the same two immortals again along the **Líquán Dao**,\nApproached them and paid homage,\nAnd they drank together joyously in a tavern.\nThe tavern keeper inquired about their origins and names,\nTo which they replied:\n*\"We are from Pú, and are twenty-two years old.\"*\nYet they did not disclose their surname.\n\nThey then bestowed upon him five secret precepts,\nAnd vanished before he could discern their whereabouts.\n\nThe **Dàdìng** era, first year, in the year **Xīnwèi**,\nThe Master built a cave dwelling in **Shícūn**, south of **Zhōngnán County**,\nNaming it the **\"Tomb of the Living Dead\"**.\nAt each corner, he planted a **hǎitáng** tree—\nWhen asked why, he replied:\n*\"In time, I shall make the winds of the Four Seas into one family.\"*\n\nIn the autumn of **Guǐwèi**,\nHe abandoned the **Tomb of the Living Dead**,\nAnd with **Hé Yùtán** and **Lǐ Língyáng**,\nBuilt a hut at **Liú Jiāng**.\n\nIn the autumn of **Jiǎshēn**,\nHe met **Liú Hǎitán** again at **Gānhé Zhèn**,\nWho gave him **xiānchán wine**—\nThus the Master composed:\n*\"The Ancestor of **Zhèngyáng**,\nAnd Master **Lǚ Chúnxiáng**,\nTheir cultivation profound and true—\nYet **Shū Hǎitán** alone\nResides with me in the **Three Isles**.\"*\n\nFrom then on, the Master drank no wine,\nBut drank only water—\nYet his face bore a drunkard’s glow,\nAnd his breath carried the scent of wine.\nHe wrote:\n*\"Awakened, I drink no dusty wine,\nOnly the cup beyond the world I share.\nSince then, white clouds follow wherever I tread,\nAnd my steps lead straight to **Pénglái**.\"*\n\nIn the spring of **Yǐyǒu**,\nHe inscribed a poem on the wall of **Tàipíng Palace** in **Zhōngnán Mountain**:\n*\"The old wind-illness rages once more,\nMy life shall not exceed fifty-eight.\"*\n\nAt this time, **Shǐ Chùhòu**, **Liú Tōngwēi**, and **Yán Chùcháng**\nSucceeded one another as his disciples.\n\nOn the **twenty-sixth day of the fourth month, Dīnghài**,\nHe suddenly set fire to his hut—\nOnlookers rushed to save him,\nBut the Master danced and sang:\n*\"The thatched hut burns—no matter!\nA noble soul must still refine himself.\nHow fierce and sincere his resolve—\nYet how can one learn my carefree ways?\"*\n\nThen, addressing his followers:\n*\"I go east to **Qiū Liú Tán** to seek my steed!\"*\nAnd so he departed eastward beyond the pass,\nArriving in **Nínghǎi Prefecture** on the **eighteenth day of the intercalary seventh month**.\nMeeting **Mǎ Yífǔ**, their words resonated in harmony,\nAnd he built a dwelling in **Mǎ Shì’s** southern **huì**,\nNaming it **\"Quánzhēn\"**.\nHe inscribed a long ode:\n*\"This hall’s name—**Quánzhēn**—speaks for itself,\nLet me recount the **Jìjìng Xiāoyáo**’s essence.\nNo need for thatched roofs to shield from rain and dew,\nNor stone halls to endure the seasons.\nA casual dwelling is hard to find,\nYet this mortal frame is but a borrowed vessel.\"*\n\n「常盖常修安在地，任眠任宿不离身。\nAt times dwelling in stillness, ever nurtured and secure,\nSleeping or waking—my form remains ever bound to this place.\n\n有时觉后尤宽大，每到醒来愈忧亲。\nYet when I rise, my heart expands in boundless ease,\nBut with each waking, my love for kin grows ever more profound.\n\n气血转流浑不漏，精神交给永无津。\nMy *qi* and blood circulate without fail,\nWhile my spirit, entrusted to the Dao, finds no end to its source.\n\n慧灯内照通三耀，福注长生出六尘。\nThe inner lamp of wisdom shines through the Three Radiant Bodies,\nBestowing blessings of longevity beyond the Six Dusts.\n\n自哂堂中心火灭，何妨诸寇积柴薪。\nI laugh at my own heart—here, the central fire extinguishes,\nYet why should I fear bandits when my fuel is but gathered kindling?\n\n全真之名盖始於此。\nHere begins the name of **Quánzhēn**—the Complete Dao.\n\n九月，邱长春自昆仑山来受学，谭长真抱疾而至，为弟子。\nIn the ninth month, **Qiū Chángchūn** came from **Kūnlún Mountain** to receive instruction,\nWhile **Tán Chángzhēn**, bearing illness, arrived as a disciple.\n\n十月，於庵锁环百日，日以分梨十化警悟宜、甫夫妇。\nIn the tenth month, he sealed himself in the hermitage for a hundred days,\nDaily dividing a pear into ten portions to awaken **Mǎ Yífǔ** and his wife.\n\n分梨十化者，师初锁环之一日，以梨一枚与宜甫啖之，每六日赐芋、栗各六枚，至是月十一日，分梨为二块，令宜甫夫妇共食之，后六日之芋、栗，旬日之梨，为常期也，其芋栗如初之数，梨则每旬例增其一，至於十旬而积数为五十有五，应天地生成之数，每与必以诗颂警悟之。\nThe **Ten Divisions of the Pear**—on the first day of his seclusion,\nHe gave **Mǎ Yífǔ** a single pear to eat.\nEvery six days, he bestowed six yams and six chestnuts,\nUntil the eleventh day of that month, when he split the pear into two pieces,\nCommanding **Mǎ Yífǔ** and his wife to share them.\nThe yams and chestnuts of the following six days,\nAnd the pears for each ten-day period, became the standard.\nThe yams and chestnuts remained as before,\nBut the pears increased by one each ten-day cycle,\nUntil ten cycles had passed and the total reached fifty-five—\nIn harmony with the **Five Phases** of Heaven and Earth’s creation.\nEach time he gave them, he did so with verses to awaken their understanding.\n\n次年戊子正月十一日启环，二月宜甫弃家入道，王玉阳自牛仙山来礼师。\nThe following year, on the eleventh day of the first month (a year of **Wùzǐ**),\nHe lifted the seal from his seclusion.\nIn the second month, **Mǎ Yífǔ** abandoned his home to enter the Dao,\nAnd **Wáng Yùyáng** came from **Niú Xiān Mountain** to pay homage to the Master.\n\n晦日，师携马、谭、邱、王四师游昆仑山，开烟霞洞居之。\nOn the last day of the month,\nThe Master took **Mǎ Yífǔ**, **Tán Chángzhēn**, **Qiū Chángchūn**, and **Wáng Yùyáng**\nTo wander **Kūnlún Mountain**, where he opened the **Yānxī Cave** as his dwelling.\n\n三月，郝广宁受业於洞中。\nIn the third month, **Hǎo Guǎngníng** studied under him in the cave.\n\n八月，师同弟子迁文登姜实庵，立七宝会。\nIn the eighth month, the Master and his disciples moved to **Jiāng Shí’s** hermitage in **Wéndēng**,\nWhere they established the **Seven Treasures Assembly**.\n\n九年春，师同马、谭、邱、郝四师回宁海，周伯通筑庵请师居，名曰金莲堂。\nIn the spring of the ninth year,\nThe Master returned to **Nínghǎi Prefecture** with **Mǎ Yífǔ**, **Tán Chángzhēn**, **Qiū Chángchūn**, and **Hǎo Guǎngníng**.\n**Zhōu Bótōng** built a hermitage and invited the Master to dwell there,\nNaming it the **Golden Lotus Hall**.\n\n重午日，宜甫妻孙氏诣金莲堂出家。\nOn the **Double Fifth Festival**,\n**Mǎ Yífǔ’s** wife, **Sūn**, came to the **Golden Lotus Hall** and took the precepts.\n\n八月，就本堂立金莲会。\nIn the eighth month, they established the **Golden Lotus Assembly** at the original hall.\n\n州人或欲写师真师，左目右转，右目左转，老少肥瘠形色无定，竟不能状。\nSome local men wished to depict the Master’s true form,\nBut his eyes turned right when moved left, and left when moved right—\nHis appearance varied between youth and age, plump and lean,\nAnd they could never capture his likeness.\n\n九月，至福山县，立三光会。\nIn the ninth month, he arrived at **Fúshān County** and established the **Three Lights Assembly**.\n\n遂游登州，登蓬莱阁，与众观海市。\nThen he wandered to **Dēng Prefecture**, ascending the **Pénglái Pavilion**,\nWhere he and his followers gazed upon the **Sea Market**.\n\n忽刮风起，人见师随风吹入海中，久之复出，冠服皆如故，观者异之，乃立玉华会，遂同马、谭、邱三师至莱州，刘长生弃家从道。\nSuddenly, a gusting wind arose,\nAnd the people saw the Master carried by the wind into the sea,\nOnly to reemerge after some time, his hat and robes unchanged.\nThe onlookers marveled, and he established the **Jade Flower Assembly**.\nThen, with **Mǎ Yífǔ**, **Tán Chángzhēn**, and **Qiū Chángchūn**,\nHe proceeded to **Láizhōu Prefecture**, where **Liú Chángshēng** abandoned his home to follow the Dao.\n\n十月，达掖县，立平等会。\nIn the tenth month, they reached **Yè County** and established the **Equality Assembly**.\n\n是月携马、谭、刘、邱四师游汴梁，寓王氏旅邸。\nThat same month, the Master took **Mǎ Yífǔ**, **Tán Chángzhēn**, **Liú Chángshēng**, and **Qiū Chángchūn**\nTo wander **Biànliáng** (Kaifeng), staying at the **Wáng Family’s** inn.\n\n岁暮，师忽书一词辞世，其末云：这回去也，一颗明珠无有价，正见真修，稳驾逍遥到岸舟。\nAt year’s end, the Master suddenly wrote a farewell *cì* (word),\nIts closing lines reading:\n*\"This parting now—no worth to this single bright pearl,\nBut true vision and genuine practice remain.\nSteady the craft, carefree, to reach the shore of the boundless boat.\"*\n\n明年庚寅正月初四日，呼四师来前曰：吾今赴师真之约矣。\nThe next year, on the fourth day of the first month (a year of **Gēngyín**),\nHe called the four disciples forward and said:\n*\"I now go to fulfill the Master’s true appointment!\"*\n\n复说颂云：\nHe then recited a verse:\n\n地肺重阳子，呼为王害风。\n*\"The **Kūnlún Mountain**’s lungs—**Zhòngyáng Zǐ**,\nCalled **Wáng Hàifēng**.\"*\n\n来时长日月，去后任西东。\n*\"When I came, the sun and moon stretched long,\nNow I depart—west or east, as the Dao wills.\"*\n\n作伴云和水，为邻虚与空。\n*\"My companions are **Yúnhé**—the Cloud and the Water,\nMy neighbors are **Xū** and **Kōng**—the Void and the Emptiness.\"*\n\n一灵真性在，不与众人同。\n*\"One true essence abides within me,\nNot shared by all.\"*\n\n言毕枕肱而逝。\nHaving spoken, he passed away, resting his head upon his arm.\n\n众皆号恸，师忽开目起坐曰：何至於此，汝等学道犹未悟此耶。\nThe disciples all wept in grief,\nBut the Master suddenly opened his eyes and sat up, saying:\n*\"Why such sorrow? Have you not yet understood this, my students of the Dao?\"*\n\n乃以秘诀五篇付丹阳，令递相规益。\nHe then entrusted **Five Secret Precepts** to **Dānyáng**,\nCommanding them to be passed down and mutually refined.\n\n遂书愒云：\nHe then inscribed a farewell poem:\n\n一侄二子一山恫，连余五个一心雄。\n*\"One nephew, two sons, and one mountain’s sorrow,\nTogether with me—five hearts, one steadfast resolve.\"*\n\n六明齐伴天边月，七爽俱邀海上风。\n*\"Six luminous ones accompany the moon at Heaven’s edge,\nSeven pure ones all invite the wind from the sea.\"*\n\n真妙裹头拈密妙，睛空面上蹑虚空。\n*\"True wonders wrap my head, plucking secrets from the profound,\nWhile my clear face treads upon the void of emptiness.\"*\n\n东西南北皆圆转，到此方知处处通。\n*\"East, west, south, and north—all revolve in perfect harmony,\nOnly here do I grasp that all places are connected.\"*\n\n书毕而化。\nHaving inscribed it, he ascended.\n\nAt first, when the Master was in **Dēngzhōu**, the Prefect **Hèshíliè Míngmiǎo** treated him with **Master’s rites**,\nAnd as they parted, he said to the Master: *\"When shall we meet again?\"*\nThe Master replied: *\"In Nánjīng.\"*\n\nWhen the Master later grew weary and ascended,\n**Míngmiǎo** was then appointed as the **Defender of Nánjīng**.\n\nThe Master had once pointed to the **Wànxiān Bridge** outside **Dēngzhōu’s Gate of the Immortal**,\nAnd said to others: *\"When you encounter me again, do not destroy it.\"*\nAfter a decade, Prefect **Hébāngyàn** hated the bridge’s lofty grandeur and demolished it.\n\nBefore leaving the pass, the Master had drawn a self-portrait of **a tricorned Daoist** with pine and crane,\nAnd entrusted it to **Shǐ Fēngxiān**, saying: *\"Keep this and await me—\nWhen I return with a horse, we shall verify our likeness.\"*\nLater, when **Dānyáng** entered the pass,\n**Fēngxiān** confirmed the likeness, and not a hair differed.\n\nSuch divine wonders were countless.\n\nHis works—*The **Quánzhēn Complete and Perfect Collections** (both **fore** and **after**), The **Tāoguāng Collection**, The **Yúnzhōng Record**, The **Divine Sayings on the Ten Transformations of the Loquat***—circulate in the world.\n\nToday, the **Encountering Immortal Hall** at **Gānhé** is where the **Loose-Robe Immortal** dwelled,\nThe **Nánshí Chéngdào Hall** is the tomb of the **Resurrected Dead**,\nThe **Great Zhòngyáng Hall of Ten Thousand Blessings** is the former **hermitage of Liú Jiāng**,\nAnd the **Great Chāoyuán Hall of Ten Thousand Blessings** in **Biànliáng** is the **guest inn of the Wáng clan**—\nAll are places where the Master attained **transcendence**.\n\nThe **Yuan Emperor Shìzǔ** bestowed the title **Great Zhòngyáng, Quánzhēn, Opener of the Dao, True Lord of Ascension**,\nAnd the **Emperor Wǔzōng** further honored him as **Great Zhòngyáng, Quánzhēn, Opener of the Dao, Aiding the Celestial Emperor**.\nThe eulogy reads:\n*\"Heaven raised an extraordinary man,\nWhose brilliance surpassed all ages.\nTwo worthy disciples met him,\nAnd five precepts were thus revealed.\"*\n\nThe **Four Shadings of the Sea-Pink** and the **Seven Blossoms of the Golden Lotus**,\nWith **Water-Clouds** as companions, I bow to the **Eastern Peak**.\n\n**Dānyáng Zǐ**—\nMaster surnamed **Mǎ**, given name **Chuán**, courtesy name **Xuánshí**, styled **Dānyáng Zǐ**,\nOriginally named **Cóngyì**, courtesy name **Yìfǔ**, a native of **Nínghǎi Prefecture**,\nBorn in the **first year of the Dàzōng Tiānhuì era of the Jin Dynasty (1133 CE), on the 20th day of the 5th month, in the year of the Hare**.\n\nWith five brothers, he was the second among them,\nHis family wealthy, known as **Mǎ Bànzhōu**.\nHe wed the daughter of **Sūn Zhōngxiǎn** of the prefecture,\nAnd fathered three sons.\n\nIn the **7th year of the Dàdìng era (1167 CE), in the intercalary 7th month**,\nHe feasted at **Fàn Míngshū’s** **Yí Lǎo Pavilion**,\nAnd, drunk with wine, composed poetry—\n*\"A man supported me in my drunken state.\"*\n\nSuddenly, **Zhòngyáng**, clad in coarse hemp robes and a bamboo hat,\nArrived in the scorching heat and directly approached his table.\nThe Master asked: *\"From where do you come?\"*\nZhòngyáng replied: *\"I came from Zhōngnán to support the drunken man.\"*\n\nThe Master marveled and offered him a melon to eat.\nZhòngyáng ate it from the rind upward, and the Master, puzzled, asked why.\nZhòngyáng said: *\"Sweetness arises from within bitterness.\"*\n\nAgain, the Master inquired after his name.\nHe answered: *\"Wáng Hàifēng.\"*\nThe Master pressed further: *\"What is your Dao-name?\"*\nZhòngyáng replied: *\"Where the Five Phases do not reach,\nBefore one’s parents gave birth.\"*\n\nAt these words, the Master awakened.\nTheir discussion harmonized deeply,\nAnd the Master invited Zhòngyáng to his home to be his teacher.\n\nEarlier, he had dreamed of building a hut in the **Southern Garden**—\nWhere cranes flew—to dwell with Zhòngyáng.\nZhòngyáng inscribed the plaque: **\"Quánzhēn.\"**\n\nOn the **1st day of the 10th month**,\nZhòngyáng sealed himself in the hut for a hundred days,\nDaily revealing to the Master the **\"Ten Transformations of the Divided Pear.\"**\nBy night, he spoke privately of the **mysteries of the Dao**.\n\nThe following year, in the **11th day of the 1st month of the year of the Rat (1168 CE)**,\nZhòngyáng removed his seal.\nOn the **8th day of the 2nd month**,\nThe Master entrusted all household matters to his three sons,\nThen left home to study the Dao,\nAnd Zhòngyáng changed his given name.\n\nIn the **9th year of the Dàdìng era (1173 CE), in the 10th month of the year of the Tiger**,\nThe Master followed Zhòngyáng to **Biànliáng (Kaifeng)**,\nStaying at the **Wáng clan’s guest inn**.\nOn the **4th day of the 1st month of the year of the Dragon (1174 CE)**,\nZhòngyáng transmitted the **Five Secret Precepts** to the Master before departing.\nThe Master then **parted his hair into three topknots**, symbolizing his teacher’s name.\n\nTogether with **Tán, Liú, and Qiū**—the three Masters—\nThey buried Zhòngyáng’s **ascended remains**,\nThat year being **Rénchén (1174 CE)**.\nThey then renovated the old hut,\nRenaming it **\"Zǔtíng\" (Ancestral Court)**.\n\nIn the **14th year of the Dàdìng era (1178 CE), on the Mid-Autumn Festival**,\nThe Master and the three Masters **Tán, Liú, and Qiū** lodged at the **Zhēnwǔ Temple in Qíndù**.\nUnder the moonlight, each declared their resolve:\nThe Master said, *\"Guó pín\"* (National poverty),\nTán said, *\"Guó shì\"* (National affairs),\nLiú said, *\"Quān zhì\"* (Circular aspiration),\nQiū said, *\"Quē xián\"* (Deficient leisure).\n\nThe next morning, they parted ways—\n**Chángzhēn and Chángshēng** traveled to **Luòyáng**,\n**Chángchūn** hid in **Mànxī Valley**,\nWhile the Master returned to **Zǔtíng**, sealing himself in retreat for a hundred days,\nEmerging only in the **8th month of the 18th year of the Dàdìng era (1182 CE), on the 1st day**.\n\nThe following year, in the **1st month**,\nHe traveled to **Huàtíng County**,\nWhere **Lǐ Dàchéng** invited him to reside.\nOn the **15th day of the 2nd month**, they sealed themselves together for a hundred days,\nAnd upon emerging, the Master **revived a withered tree outside the retreat**.\n\nIn the **20th year (1184 CE)**,\nHe journeyed to **Jīngzhào (Xi’an)**,\nWhere **Zhào Pénglái** donated a residence for a hut,\nAnd the Master again sealed himself for a hundred days before returning to **Zǔtíng**.\n\nIn the **22nd year (1186 CE), in the 4th month**,\nHe returned east to **Nínghǎi**,\nTraveling south to **Jīngnán**,\nWhere a man named **Hán Táochéng**, styled **Qīngfǔ**,\nBowed in reverence and sought instruction.\nThe Master said:\n*\"The Dao takes **realizing one’s true nature** as its essence,\n**Nurturing life** as its function,\n**Softness and weakness** as its foundation,\n**Purity and coldness** as its base.\nNaturally, it extinguishes desire in emptiness,\nAnd calms the spirit at its utmost.\nThus, the **mysteries of the Dao** are attained without leaving one’s courtyard.\"*\n\nResiding in the **Jīnlián Hall** of the prefecture,\nThe hall’s **salty-bitter well** was undrinkable,\nYet the Master **dug it deeper**, transforming it into **sweet springwater**.\nOnce, he composed couplets:\n*\"Flames erupt from water, three elixirs condense,\nFire enfolds the lotus, one nature is perfected.\nA Daoist brother, devoid of self,\nA virtuous warrior, beyond human sentiment.\"*\n\nSuch teachings were many.\n\nIn the twenty-fourth year, in the year of *Gěngmǎo* (1303), a man named Wén Dēng from Xiàyuán requested that the Master preside over a grand ritual (*jiào*). The assembly witnessed the *Chóngyáng* (Double Ninth) manifestation appear in the void atop a white tortoise.\n\nOn the last day of the month, the Master wandered to the *Sān Jiào* Hall in the city’s north. At that time, his disciples had all gathered, when suddenly, the Daoist Master Wáng Dàoshī of Wéngzhōu arrived, cradling a *qín*. The Master then took up his brush and composed *\"The Return-to-the-Mountains Operative\"* (*Guīshān Cāo*), displaying it to the assembly:\n\n*\"To do nothing is to do all,\nTo know nothing is to know all.\nKnowing this Dao, who would not act?\nActing for this Dao, who would still know?\n\nThe wind sighs, the leaves scatter,\nThe crows cry, flying south.\nAlas, the world turns, days and months flee—\nOld and dying, yet still clinging to delusion.\n\nThe world wounds, the soul longs to rise,\nThe world wounds, the heart nearly shatters.\nHard to end—yet people ask not why,\nPointing to the green mountains, I must return soon.\n\nNight falls on the green mountains, the moon ascends,\nDawn breaks on the green mountains, the moon departs.\nHungry, I eat the clouds; thirsty, I drink from the streams,\nCut off from the world, yet none know me.\n\nWithout knowing, without doing,\nThis heart extinguished, what more to seek?\nSuddenly, twin flowers bloom in the Celestial Court,\nAscending the Three Palaces, wandering the Purple Microcosm.\n\nThis revealed his intent to return to the True.\"\n\nHe then proceeded to Láiyáng, residing in the *Yóuxiān Gōng* (Palace of Wandering Immortals).\n\nOn the twenty-second day of the twelfth month, the *Chóngyáng* Immortal’s birthday, the Master completed the ritual and conversed with his disciples into the night. By the second watch, a sudden storm erupted—thunder cracked, and he told his disciples:\n*\"I now depart for the Hall of the Immortal Assembly to return. Let me be a joyous immortal.\nIf you wish to become immortals, you must strive in cultivation and practice. Even if you encounter a thousand demons and a hundred hardships, never falter or grow weary.\"*\n\nWith these words, he sat upright and departed.\n\nThat night, his spirit wandered to the homes of Guò Fùzhōng and Liú Xī, leaving a verse in each. Only the next day did they learn of the Master’s ascension.\n\nHis works—*The Golden and Precious*, *Gradual Awakening*, *Conduct in Transformation*, *Achieving the Dao*, *Perfecting the Dao*, and *Essential Subtleties*—six collections in total, along with one *Record of Sayings*, circulated in the world.\n\nToday, the *Yóuxiān Gōng* in Láiyáng County is the very place where the Master attained transcendence.\n\nThe Emperor Shizu of the Yuan Dynasty posthumously conferred upon him the title *\"Dānyáng Bàoyī Wúwéi Zhēnrén\"* (True Person of Embracing Unity and Non-Action in Dānyáng). The Emperor Wǔzōng further elevated him to *\"Dānyáng Bàoyī Wúwéi Pǔhuà Zhēnjūn\"* (Universal Illuminating True Lord of Embracing Unity and Non-Action in Dānyáng).\n\nEulogy:\n*\"Dreaming of cranes, meeting the Way,\nTasting melon, gaining insight.\nTen transformations enter the heart,\nThree braids rest upon the crown.\"*\n\n「The Way returns to withered wood, and the well transforms into sweet spring waters.\nThunder shakes the earth, winds stir the heavens—white clouds drift beneath azure skies.\n\n**Master Zhēng**—surname Tán, given name Chǔduān, courtesy name Tōngzhèng, with the sobriquet **Longzhēn Zǐ**—was a native of Nínghǎi. Originally named Yù, with the courtesy name Bóyù, he was born in the first year of the Jīn Taìzōng’s Tiān Huì era (癸卯三月朔).\n\nIn his youth, he fell into a well yet sat unharmed upon the water, and when he encountered fire, he showed no fear—all marveled at his nature. At fifteen, he took to learning, composing the *Pútao Piān* (Grape Essay), which became widely acclaimed.\n\nOnce, while intoxicated on a journey outside, he fell ill with a wind-induced paralysis. In autumn of the seventh year of the Tàidìng era, hearing that Master Zhòngyáng was accepting disciples, he abandoned his wife and sought him at Quánzhēn Temple, paying homage and pledging himself as a student. The night was bitterly cold, the furnace’s embers crackling faintly, almost unbearable. Zhòngyáng then spread his feet and commanded the Master to embrace them; soon, sweat drenched his body like a meal after eating. When he rose the next day, Zhòngyáng washed his face with the remaining water from his ablutions, and thus his lingering ailment vanished instantly, his beard and eyebrows restored. The Master then knelt and prayed to Zhòngyáng, seeking the Dao’s daily practice. Zhòngyáng revealed a four-character secret formula and gifted him a poem, altering his name to **Dàzhēn Tán Yù** (True Master of Embracing the Way).\n\nIn winter of the ninth year, Zhòngyáng traveled to Biàn (汴), and the Master accompanied him along with disciples Mǎ Yìfǔ, Liú Shì, and Qiū Shì, lodging at the Ráng Shì inn. The following year, on the fourth day of the first month (Regānyīn), Zhòngyáng ascended to transcendence. The Master and his three fellow disciples carried his remains westward to bury them beside Liú Jiāng’s grave, dwelling there for three years.\n\nIn autumn of the fourteenth year, the Master ventured east beyond the Pass, residing at the Cháoyuán Temple in Luòyáng. Later, he journeyed to the Héshuò region, settling at the new hermitage in Jìxià County beside Fǔjūn Temple. One day, while traveling to Wèizhōu, he arrived at dusk when the temple officials, Wēn Liù, spied the glow of fire within the hermitage. Peering in, they saw the Master clasped in flames. The officials, alarmed, sent someone to the prefecture to summon him, but he was still sleeping in the northern inn of the district. Upon his return, the embers had not yet extinguished.\n\nIn the fifteenth year, the Master visited the **Zìzǔ Zhèn** (Second Ancestor’s Abode) in Cízhōu. There, he encountered a drunken man who asked, *\"From where do you come?\"* Before he could answer, the man struck him with a fist, breaking his teeth and causing blood to flow—yet his expression grew only more serene. He spat out the teeth and held them in his palm, then danced and departed. The townsfolk, enraged, brought the matter to the officials, but the Master merely said, *\"He was drunk.\"* Dan Yang, who was then in the central Pass, heard of the incident and praised him: *\"A single punch dissolves all one’s past karma.\"*\n\nIn the sixteenth year, while passing through Báijiā Tān (白家滩) in Shànglò, a farmer had been ill for months without remedy. In a dream, a Daoist practitioner gave him a red medicine, and upon waking, his ailment was cured. The next day, he saw the Master and exclaimed in astonishment: *\"This is the very practitioner who gave me the medicine in my dream!\"* He wished to thank him, but the Master paid him no heed.\n\nIn the twenty-first year, the Master returned westward, staying at the Chunyáng Cave in Huáyīn. He instructed the assembly: *\"In six years, I extinguished all the flames of ignorance. In ten years, I refined the Elixir of Bone Transformation. The boundless void of the empty hall holds no obstruction, and I have already known how to leap beyond the gates of life and death.\"* He then traveled again to Luòyáng, where he found a plot of land near the Cháoyuán Temple and built a hermitage to dwell in.\n\nIn the twenty-fifth year (Yǐsì 四月朔), he instructed his disciples to prepare his burial in advance, then composed the *\"Xíngxiāng Zǐ\"* (Fragrant Incense Song):\n\n*\"A single thunderclap of harmony—\nEmerging light, a thousand radiant dragons meet the swift bolt.\nDiscarding the shell once more,\nSubtle essence bursts forth—\nGolden glow pierces the crown,\nOne nature ascends,\nTo the Jade Pool.\nJoining Dan Yang in his company,\nFollowing his manifestation,\nThe Longzhēn’s profound and wondrous Dao of Non-Action.\nHis radiant spirit surges forth,\nReturning alone.\"*\n\nUpon completing the poem, he departed. A strange fragrance lingered in the room for several days. His *\"Shuǐyún Jí\"* (Water Cloud Collection) circulated in the world.\n\nToday, the **Qīxiá Guān** (Nesting Cloud Temple) in Nínghǎi is his former residence, while the Cháoyuán Temple in Luòyáng’s southern region is the very place where he attained transcendence.\n\nThe Emperor Shizu of the Yuan Dynasty posthumously conferred upon him the title *\"Chángzhēn Yúnshuǐ Dàngdé Zhēnrén\"* (True Person of Nurturing Virtue and Drifting Water in Embracing the Long Dao). The Emperor Wǔzōng further elevated him to *\"Chángzhēn Níngshén Xuánjìng Yùndé Zhēnjūn\"* (True Lord of Congealing Spirit, Profound Tranquility, and Encompassing Virtue in Embracing the Long Dao).\n\nEulogy:\n*\"Seeking the Master in sickness,\nTossing sleepless through the cold snow.\nSpring warms both feet,\nThe radiant Dao ignites the night—\nBurning away cunning and dullness,\nAwakening outside Wèizhōu.\"*\n\nRiding the phoenix and straddling the crane,\nShaking off the arm to the Ocean Isles.\nThe **Chángshēng Zǐ**—Master Liu by surname, **Chǔxuán** by given name,\n**Tōngmiào** by courtesy, **Chángshēng Zǐ** by appellation—\nA native of Wǔguān Village in Dōnglái,\nBorn in the seventh month, twelfth day, on the *Dīngmǎo* year of Jin Xīzōng’s *Huángtóng* era.\n\nHe was renowned for filial piety toward his mother,\nSolemnly vowing never to wed or seek office,\nRegarding external affairs with serene indifference.\nHe repeatedly wished to take monastic vows,\nBut his mother would not permit it.\n\nIn the second month of *Dàdìng*’s ninth year,\nHe suddenly beheld on his neighbor’s wall\nTwo inscriptions beyond mortal reach,\nThe ink still fresh, no name left behind.\nThe final verse read:\n*\"In Wǔguān’s nurturing virtue, the True Immortal’s land,\nThere must be one who lives forever, never dies.\"*\n\nThe Master marveled at the bold, potent strokes,\nYet could not fathom their meaning.\n\nIn the ninth month, on *Chóngyáng* Festival,\nMǎ, Tán, and Qiú—three Masters—came to Dōnglái.\nThe Master went to greet and pay homage.\n*Chóngyáng* turned and smiled:\n*\"Do you recognize the ink marks on the wall?\"*\n\nThe Master then poured out his sincerity,\nBeseeching to be taken as a disciple.\n*Chóngyáng*, seeing his spirit untainted by the mundane,\nSighed: *\"The moon of the pine, the snow of the bamboo—\nThus, I do not receive him from the yellow dust.\"*\n\nHe bestowed a poem upon him,\nEstablishing his present name and title,\nWhen the Master was but in his youth.\nHe then followed *Chóngyáng* to the capital.\n\nThe following spring, *Chóngyáng* ascended in transcendence.\nThe Master, along with Mǎ, Tán, and Qiú,\nConcealed their immortal transformations in Liújiāng,\nDwelling beside a tomb for three years.\n\nIn autumn of the *Jiǎwǔ* year,\nHe abandoned his traces for the capital,\nHis heart ashen, his spirit cold,\nHis body lifeless, untouched by spring.\nHe ate only when given food,\nSpoke only when questioned.\n\nIn autumn of the eighteenth year,\nHe relocated to Yúnxī Grotto in the northeast of Luòchéng,\nWhere his disciples carved a cave dwelling.\nSuddenly, a stone well was uncovered—\nThe crowd was astonished.\nThe Master laughed:\n*\"Not far, just a few feet deeper, there are two more wells.\nThese are the places where I refined myself in three past lives.\"*\n\nWhen dug, they were indeed found.\n\nIn autumn of the twenty-first year,\nHe returned east to Lái Zhōu,\nThe next year settling at his ancestral home in Wǔguān,\nBuilding a hermitage.\n\nIn the second year of *Míngchāng*,\nFùmǎ Dūwèi Bùsǎn, stationed in Lái Zhōu,\nMisled by slander, ordered the military to pursue and imprison him.\nSoon, a market vendor saw the Master in the city’s south,\nConversing with Daoist companions as usual.\nJīngyā Yāzhě Wáng, overseeing the case,\nAlso witnessed him.\nThey assumed he had escaped,\nBut upon checking the prison, the Master lay fast asleep.\n\nThe two, stunned, reported what they had seen to the Dūwèi,\nWho then realized the Master was a man of the Way.\nHe swiftly ordered his release.\n\nIn the *Dīngsì* year of *Chéng’ān*’s second year,\nEmperor Zhāngzōng, hearing of his reputation,\nSummoned him to court and inquired about the Supreme Dao.\nThe Master replied:\n*\"The essence of the Supreme Dao lies in:\nFew desires bring bodily ease,\nLight taxation brings national prosperity.\"*\n\nThe Emperor said: *\"Is this the teaching of Guāngchéng Zǐ?\"*\nHe ordered the Master to reside at Tiāncháng Guān.\n\nThe following March, he received imperial decree to return to the mountains,\nAnd was granted incense—\nHe firmly declined, but the imperial edict renamed his hermitage *Língxū Guān*.\n\nIn the first month of the *Guǐhài* year of *Tàihé*’s third year,\nLiú Zhàoyì, the East Capital’s military governor,\nAnd Liú Shīlǔ, commander of Dìnghǎi Army,\nCame to pay respects and seek instruction.\nThe Master said:\n*\"You are both eminent ministers of this age,\nDeeply honored by your favor—\nI am about to depart.\nI am unworthy to be your friend.\"*\n\nHe then revealed a verse:\n*\"At the towering peak’s height,\nWhat use to linger, when one may turn and go?\nNow I must follow in succession,\nTurning back to gaze upon Xīyī.\"*\n\nThe two officials, moved to tears, read it.\n\nOn the sixth day of the second month,\nDrums gathered the assembly,\nAnd the Master announced his departure,\nInstructing his disciples:\n*\"Each protect the teachings well,\nLest laziness take root.\"*\n\nThen, with bent arm, he passed away.\n\nHis works—*Xiānlè*, *Tàixū*, *Pányáng*, *Tóngchén*,\n*Ānxián*, and *Xiūzhēn*—six collections in total,\nAs well as commentaries on *Dàodé*, *Yīnfú Yǎn*,\nand *Huángtíng Shù*—circulate in the world.\n\nToday, the **Chángshēng Wànshòu Palace** in Luòyáng\nMarks the site of Yúnxī’s Three-Well Grotto,\nWhile **Wǔguān Língxū Guān** is his former residence,\nThe very place where he attained transcendence.\n\nThe Emperor Shizu of the Yuan Dynasty conferred upon him the title\n*\"Chángshēng Fǔhuà Míngdé Zhēnrén\"* (True Person of Nurturing Virtue and Aiding Transformation in Embracing the Long Dao).\nThe Emperor Wǔzōng further elevated him to\n*\"Chángshēng Fǔhuà Zōng Xuánmíngdé Zhēnjūn\"* (True Lord of Nurturing Virtue, Aiding Transformation, and Encompassing Profound Clarity in Embracing the Long Dao).\n\nEulogy:\n*\"Snow-bamboo, moon-pine—\nFar beyond the dusty realm.\nHaving awakened to three past lives,\nAgain attaining the two wells.\"*\n\nThe Purple Veil spans the cavern,\nWhile white clouds encircle the Han.\n\nMagnificent Dao-Warrior,\nHe humbly sat before the master.\n\n**Master Zhāngchūn Zǐ**—\nSurname Qiú, given name Chǔjī,\nStyle-name Tōngmì, sobriquet Zhāngchūn Zǐ—\nHails from Bīndū, Qīngxiá County, Lóngzhōu,\nBorn in the fifth year of the *Xiānzōng* era of the Jin Dynasty (Steel Dragon, first month, nineteenth day).\n\nAs a child, he was precociously bright,\nRecording a thousand words daily.\nBefore reaching maturity, he sought the Dao,\nAnd secluded himself at Kūnjiàn Mountain.\n\nIn the seventh year of *Dàdìng*,\nHearing of Zhòngyáng’s Dao-teachings,\nIn the ninth month, he paid homage at Quánzhēn’ān in Nínghǎi.\nZhòngyáng bestowed upon him the *Jīnlín* (Golden Scale),\nThus making him his disciple,\nAnd renamed him with his present name and style.\n\nIn the winter of the ninth year,\nHe followed Zhòngyáng to travel in Biànliáng,\nStaying at a guesthouse of the Wang clan.\nThe following first month, fourth day,\nZhòngyáng ascended to the Dao,\nAnd Master, along with the three disciples Mǎ, Tán, and Liú,\nBuried his mortal remains at Liújiāng,\nDwelling by his grave for two years.\n\nIn the autumn of the year *Jiǎwǔ*,\nHe entered the Mòxī Grotto, living as a hermit,\nBegging for one meal a day,\nWearing a single raincoat—\nPeople called him *Suōyī Xiānshēng* (Raincoat Master),\nSleepless by day and night for six years.\n\nAgain, he secluded himself at Lǒngzhōu’s Lóngmén Mountain,\nPracticing austerities as in Mòxī,\nAnd distant seekers of the Dao flocked to him.\n\nIn the second month of the twenty-eighth year of *Dàdìng*,\nThe Emperor Shìzōng summoned him to the capital,\nHis answers pleasing the throne,\nAnd he was granted a scholar’s cap and gown,\nResiding at Tiāncháng Guān.\n\nThat summer, fifth month,\nHe was summoned to Chángsōng Dǎo,\nWhere the Emperor inquired of the principles of longevity.\nThe Master replied:\n*\"Preserving essence and perfecting spirit—\nThe essence of self-cultivation.\nHumility and non-action—\nThe foundation of governing the world.\nWealth and honor breed arrogance and dissipation,\nWhich are the natural inclinations of men—\nOne must only be ever-vigilant and diligent in self-discipline.\nIf sincerely practiced over time,\nThe Dao of transcendence is not distant.\"*\n\n「His words were strange and uncanny—\nYet the Emperor found them most virtuous.\n\nIn the seventh month, he was summoned again to the Imperial Hall,\nWhere the Master expounded upon ultimate truths,\nAnd the Emperor rejoiced greatly.\n\nThe next day, the Emperor bestowed peach trees from the Upper Garden,\nYet the Master had abstained from tea and fruit for over a decade,\nAnd at this time, he took but one to eat.\n\nHe composed the *Yáotāi Dìyīcéng* (Jade Terrace First Layer) lyric in response to imperial decree.\n\nIn the eighth month, he received an edict to return to his ancestral home,\nAnd was granted a ceremonial farewell,\nBut he declined the honors and declined to accept.\n\nIn the second year of *Míngchāng* (Sinological: 明昌), on a *Xīnwèi* (辛亥) day,\nHe departed eastward to reside at Qíxiá,\nTransforming his old home into an observatory,\nAnd was granted the inscription *Tàixū* (太虚) by imperial decree.\n\nIn the seventh year of *Tàihé* (泰和), on a *Dīngmǎo* (丁卯) spring,\nThe Princess *Shī* (施) presented him with a complete collection of Daoist scriptures,\nDelivered by courier to *Tàixū Guān* (太虚观).\n\nIn the second year of *Zhēnyòu* (贞佑), on a *Jiǎxū* (甲戌) winter,\nWar erupted in Shandong,\nAnd the military governor’s office requested the Master’s talisman to pacify the region—\nWherever he passed, soldiers cast down their weapons and bowed in submission,\nBringing peace to the states of *Nínghǎi* (宁海) and *Dēng* (登).\n\nThat spring, the *Jīn* (金) Emperor *Xuānzōng* (宣宗)\nOrdered the military overseer of *Dōngpíng* (东平), *Wáng Tíngyù* (王庭玉),\nTo summon the Master, but he did not comply.\n\nIn the third year of *Xīngdìng* (兴定), on a *Jǐmǎo* (己卯) day,\nThe Master dwelled at *Lái* (莱) State’s *Hàotiān Guān* (昊天观),\nWhen the region of *Qí-Lǔ* (齐鲁) fell to the *Sòng* (宋).\n\nIn the eighth month,\nThe *Sòng* Emperor *Níngzōng* (宁宗)\nCommanded the great general *Péng Yì* (彭义) to summon the Master,\nBut he also did not comply.\n\nThat year, the *Yuān* (元) *Tàizǔ* (太祖), *Chéngjísī* (成吉思) Emperor,\nWhile still in *Nàimàn* (奈蛮) Country,\nOrdered his attendant *Liú Zhònglù* (刘仲禄) to carry an imperial edict and invite the Master.\nIn the twelfth month, *Zhònglù* arrived at *Lái* (莱) State,\nAnd the Master, moved, accepted the summons.\n\nThe following year, on a *Gēngchén* (庚辰) day in the first month,\nThe Master set out on his journey,\nWith eighteen senior disciples accompanying him.\n\nIn the second month, he entered the *Yàn* (燕) Province,\nResiding at *Yùxū Guān* (玉虚观).\n\nIn the third month, he submitted a memorial outlining his intentions.\nIn the fourth month, he passed through *Jūyōng Guān* (居庸关),\nWhen suddenly he encountered a bandit horde—\nAll prostrated themselves and withdrew in reverence.\n\nIn the tenth month, the Master reached *Wǔchuān* (武川),\nAnd submitted another memorial urging *Hèchā* (何刺) to deliver the edict and hasten his summons.\n\nOn a *Shēnyè* (辛巳) spring,\nHe crossed the *Yú* (瑜) Pass and headed north.\n\nIn the third month of *Rénwǔ* (壬午),\nThe Emperor dispatched the Grand Preceptor *Ālǐxiān* (阿里鲜) to greet him,\nAnd ordered *Zhònglù* to pacify the seas and guard his passage.\nThe *Bōlǔ* (播鲁) *Wànhù* (万户) was instructed to send armored soldiers to escort the Master through the *Tiěmén* (铁门),\nAnd in the fourth month, he finally arrived at *Yìntǔ* (印土),\nWhere he met the Emperor beneath the *Dàxuě Shān* (大雪山).\n\nThe Emperor set up two pavilions before the Imperial Throne,\nWhere the Master was housed for ease of consultation.\n\nOn the fifteenth of the tenth month,\nThe Emperor held a grand ceremonial gathering,\nAnd the Master, seated before him,\nDiscussed the *Dàodé* (王道) of kingship.\nAt the time, the Grand Preceptor *Āhǎi Ālǐxiān* (阿海阿里鲜) was in attendance,\nAnd the Master expounded that temperance in desires was the key to self-cultivation,\nThat loving the people was the way to eternal prosperity,\nAnd that Heaven’s Dao favored life and abhorred killing.\nThe Emperor delighted in his words,\nAnd commanded his attendants to record them in official scrolls—\nTheir full account appears in the *Qìnghuì Lù* (庆会录).\n\nIn the second month of *Guǐwèi* (癸未),\nThe Master declined to return home,\nBut the Emperor urged him to stay.\nIn the third month, he again declined,\nAnd the Emperor’s decree granted his request.\nThe gifts bestowed upon him were lavish and abundant,\nYet he refused them all,\nAnd departed with his disciples together,\nWith the Grand Preceptor *Ālǐxiān* (阿里鲜) escorting him back east.\nUpon reaching *Qíxiá Guān* (栖霞观) at *Ābùhǎn Shān* (阿不罕山),\nThe Master gathered all the disciples of *Qíxiá* (栖霞)\nAnd they all returned together.\n\nIn the third month of *Jiǎshēn* (甲申),\nHe arrived at the capital,\nAnd that month, the Emperor sent *Hèchā* (何刺) to deliver an edict:\n*\"When the Daoist Immortal Qiū arrives in Han lands,\nAny city or territory under my rule—\nLet him reside wherever he wishes.\"*\n\nThe Master’s deeds and travels are recorded in the *Xīyóu Jì* (西游记).\nThe provincial administration requested that he dwell at *Tiāncháng Guān* (天长观),\nAnd from then on, envoys to the Imperial Palace\nWould always inquire after the Master’s well-being,\nAnd the Emperor would invariably send back words of instruction to the provincial administration.\n\nAgain, the *Qiónghuá Dǎo* (琼华岛) was designated as an observatory,\nAnd the Master ordered artisans to construct it.\n\nOn a *Yǐyǒu* (乙酉) spring,\nThe Master broke off a branch of a *lǐ* (梨) tree and gave it to the Daoist recluse *Xuánníng* (玄宁) *Zhāng Qùhuá* (张去华),\nSaying: *\"This is an auspicious sign for a son.\"*\n\n*Zhāng Qùhuá* nurtured it in a jar,\nAnd by autumn, it bore twenty-four fruits,\nFrom which a child was born—\nThis was *Míngchéng* (明诚).\n\nThe *Yánxiáng Guān* (延祥观) had a withered *kūhuái* (枯槐) tree,\nAnd the Master struck it with his staff, declaring: *\"The withered huái shall live again.\"*\nLater, the huái tree flourished once more.\n\nIn the ninth month,\nThe *Yínghuò* (荧惑) star invaded the *Wěi Xiù* (尾宿),\nAnd the pacification commissioner *Wáng Yì* (王揖) requested the Master’s intervention to avert the omen—\nThat very night, the *Yínghuò* star retreated several degrees.\n\nIn the fifth month of *Bǐngxū* (丙戌),\nA great drought struck, and the provincial administration asked the Master to pray for rain—\nAnd the heavens answered with three days of downpour.\n\nIn the fifth month of *Dīnghài* (丁亥),\nThe Emperor decreed that *Qiónghuá Dǎo* (琼华岛) be named *Wàn’ān Gōng* (万安宫),\nAnd that *Tiāncháng Guān* (天长观) be renamed *Chángchūn Gōng* (长春宫).\nHe granted the Master the *jīn* (金) *jīn* (金) *hǔshì* (虎符) seal,\nAppointing him to oversee all Daoist affairs across the realm,\nAnd by special imperial decree, Daoist institutions were exempted from all taxes and levies.\n\nOn the twenty-third day of the sixth month,\nA thunderous rainstorm erupted—\nThe *Tàiyè Chí* (太液池) southern bank collapsed,\nAnd the *Běikǒu Shān* (北口山) crumbled.\nThe Master, hearing the news, laughed and said:\n*\"When the mountains crumble and the pools dry,\nI shall depart with them together.\"*\n\nOn the ninth day of the seventh month,\nThe Master ascended to the *Bǎoxuān Táng* (宝玄堂),\nWhere he expounded upon the matters of life and death to the assembly.\nHe said again:\n*\"Daoist institutions must exert their utmost effort—\nThe physical world is a realm of dust and toil.\nCultivate the inner mind—\nCast aside all worldly affairs,\nAnd each should strive forward earnestly,\nLest time be wasted in vain.\"*\n\nAt the time, *Guāngzhèng* (光正) was unable to find anyone skilled in Daoist matters,\nAnd *Yǐn Zhìpíng* (尹志平) and *Lǐ Zhìcháng* (李志常) succeeded him in turn.\nThus, he inscribed an ode:\n*\"Life and death are but morning and evening affairs—\nA fleeting illusion, like bubbles in flowing water.\nWhen the faintest light appears, the shadow of the hare leaps,\nAnd when the profound mysteries unfold, the seas and mountains are embraced.\nThe eight strings of the *qín* (琴) are dismissed with a sweep,\nAs if the world’s affairs were but a passing whim.\nMad verses spill from the brush like dust and filth,\nYet rest in the ears of those who listen in vain.\"*\n\nHaving finished, he returned to the *Bǎoguāng Táng* (葆光堂),\nWhere he sat in meditation and passed away.\n\nHis works include the *Mòxī* (墦溪) and *Wūdào* (呜道) collections,\nAnd the *Xīyóu Jì* (西游记) circulates in the world.\n\nToday, the *Tàixū Guān* (太虚观) in Qíxiá County\nIs the site of his former home,\nThe *Mòxī Chángchūn Chéngdào Gōng* (墦溪长春成道宫)\nIs where he perfected his Daoist cultivation,\nAnd the *Dà Chángchūn Gōng* (大长春宫) in the capital\nIs where he ascended to transcendence.\n\nThe *Yuān* (元) Emperor *Shìzǔ* (世祖) bestowed upon him the title:\n*\"Long-Chūn Yǎn Dào Zhǔjiào Zhēnrén\"* (长春演道主教真人).\nThe *Wǔ* (武) Emperor further elevated him:\n*\"Long-Chūn Quándé Shénhuà Míngyìng Zhēnjūn\"* (长春全德神化明应真君).\n\nThe eulogy reads:\n*\"Majestic Long-Chūn, a lone figure in mist and rain,\nClad in a single straw raincoat.\nSix years in seclusion at the Mòxī,\nAnd ten thousand miles to the snowy mountains.\"*\n\nThe *Hongfan* inscribed in vermilion serves as the sovereign’s teacher.\nThe jade talisman and golden tiger manifest the Dao and illuminate the age.\n\n**Master Yuyang** bore the surname **Wang**, given name **Chǔyī**, with the courtesy name **Yuyang** and sobriquet **Jieyangzi**, a native of Dongmou, Ninghai. Born in the third month, eighteenth day, of the *Rénxū* year (1142) under Emperor Xizong of the Jin, his mother dreamed of a crimson mist enveloping her body before his birth. At seven years old, he died without illness and then revived, thus understanding the matters of life and death.\n\nOnce, while wandering in the mountains, he encountered an old man seated upon a stone who spoke with him. He also heard a voice from the sky declaring itself the Master of the *Xuántíng* Palace, after which he seemed to grasp some profound truth, though others remained unaware.\n\nClad in rags, barefoot, he sang and danced in the marketplace, and people took him for a madman. When some insisted he was not ill and forced a cap and marriage upon him, the Master refused.\n\nIn the second year of *Dàdìng* (1165), upon hearing of Master Zhongyang’s arrival in the prefecture, he went to greet and pay homage, requesting to become his disciple. Zhongyang renamed him and had him reside at the *Yānxīá Dòng* in Kūnjiàn Mountain. His mother, Madame Zhou, also wished to take the precepts, and Zhongyang renamed her *Rìdéqīng*, with the sobriquet *Xuánjìng Sànrén*.\n\nThat autumn, he attended Zhongyang as he ascended *Wénchéng Lǐng*, residing at *Jiāngshí’ān*. The following spring, the Master departed for *Chá Shān*, while Zhongyang, along with Masters Mǎ, Tán, Qiú, and Hǎo, returned to Ninghai from Wénchéng Lǐng. Passing through *Lóngzhuō*, two hundred *li* from Chá Shān, during scorching heat, Zhongyang held an umbrella, which suddenly flew from his hand and fell upon Chá Shān. The Master found a poem within the umbrella’s handle, along with the characters *Jieyangzi*, and thus adopted the sobriquet.\n\nLater, he resided in *Yúnguāng Dòng* for nine years, his conduct and austerities unyielding. Once, he stood with one foot balanced upon a great chasm, earning the name *Tiějiǎo Xiān* (Iron-Footed Immortal).\n\nRoaming Qi and Lu, he displayed extraordinary divine feats—delivering souls, expelling ghosts, crushing thieves beneath his tread, entering dreams and spirits, summoning rain to shake the peaks, cooking chickens and descending cranes, reviving the dead and reviving the withered. Across a thousand *li*, his renown stirred the age.\n\nEmperor Shìzōng of Jin heard of his name. In the twenty-seventh year (1170), the *Dīngwù* year, he was summoned to the capital. When asked about the principles of longevity and governance, the Master replied: *\"Nurture the essence to preserve the spirit, maintain stillness to embrace non-action.\"* All his responses aligned with the imperial will, and he was lodged at *Tiāncháng Guān*.\n\nTime passed, and envious officials plotted against him, inviting him to drink and then burying him alive. The Master had forewarned his disciples to dig a pool and fill it with water. Upon arrival, he drained the cup in one draught, declaring, *\"I am a poor man, accustomed to begging meals from others. Today, I am fortunate to be invited—let me finish your wine to fulfill your hospitality.\"* After drinking again, he returned, and the pool’s water boiled, though his beard and hair fell out, preventing him from donning a cap. The emperor, hearing this, dispatched officials to investigate, questioning him repeatedly. The Master refused to name his accusers, only saying, *\"I have never wronged anyone; this illness must be my fate.\"* The officials reported his words, and the emperor praised him further.\n\nThe following spring (*Wùshēn* year, 1171), the emperor decreed the construction of *Xiūzhēn Guān* for his residence. The Master requested leave to attend to his aging mother, and the emperor granted it, returning all imperial gifts. That year, the emperor fell ill, and in the twelfth month, he was summoned again. The Master told the envoys, *\"I fear I may not see the imperial face again.\"* On the third day of the first month of the *Jǐyǒu* year (1174), he arrived in the capital, two days after the emperor’s passing. The new sovereign retained him to conduct funeral rites for the late emperor before allowing his return.\n\nIn the second year of *Chéng’ān* (1176), the *Dīngwèi* year, Emperor Zhāngzōng summoned him to the inner palace. Their exchanges pleased the emperor, who favored him greatly. The next day, he was granted a golden cap and purple robes, titled *Tǐxuān Tiānshī*, and housed at *Chóngfú Guān*. That summer (*Wǔwǔ* year), he petitioned for his mother’s release, now ninety years old, to care for her. The emperor granted his request, bestowing rich gifts, and the Master returned eastward.\n\nIn the first year of *Tàihé* (1201, *Xīnyǒu* year) and the third year (*Guǐhài* year, 1203), he was twice summoned to perform rites at *Tàiqīng Guān* in Bózhōu, ordaining over a thousand Daoists.\n\nThat seventh month, twenty-fifth day, his mother, Xuánjìng, passed away.\n\nIn the seventh year (*Jǐsì* year, 1207), he resided at *Shèngshuǐ Yùxū Guān*, where the imperial consort sent a Daoist scripture as a gift.\n\nIn the first year of *Tài’ān* (1209, *Jǐwǔ* year), the seventh month, the *Bóshuǐ Lǔ* official requested he reside at *Huáyáng Guān* in the northern capital. The following year (*Gēngwǔ* year, 1210), he settled in *Yùtián County*, Jìzhou, telling his disciples, *\"Do you hear the clashing of celestial swords from the sky? The northern *qi* is shifting—many will perish from its poison.\"* That year, the imperial armies indeed marched south.\n\nIn the fourth year of *Zhēnyòu* (1216), the people of Wénchéng invited him to *Tiānbǎo Guān*. The following year, on the twenty-second day of the fourth month of the *Dīngchǒu* year (1217), after bathing and donning ceremonial attire, he bowed in all four directions before entering *nirvana* in seated meditation. His works, the *Yúnguāng Jí* and *Xiǎn Yì Lù*, circulate in the world.\n\nToday, *Shèngshuǐ Yùxū Guān* in Ninghai marks his former home, while *Tiānbǎo Guān* in Wénchéng is where he ascended to transcendence.\n\nThe *Yuán* Emperor *Shìzǔ* bestowed upon him the title:\n*\"Yùyáng Tǐxuān Guǎngdù Zhēnrén\"* (玉阳体玄广度真人).\nThe *Wǔ* Emperor further elevated him:\n*\"Yùyáng Tǐxuān Guǎngcí Pǔdù Zhēnjūn\"* (玉阳体玄广慈普度真君).\n\nThe eulogy reads:\n*\"Wondrous Yuyang, his marvels recorded in light.\nDiscoursing on stone, the umbrella flies through the sky.\nIlluminating the imperial throne like stars,\nThe spring pool’s waters boil.\nWith golden cap bestowed, he sheathed his sword and returned east.\nThe Broad-Nurturing Child.\"*\n\nMaster Hao, given name Datong, courtesy name Taigu, with the sobriquet Guangningzi, was a native of Ninghai. He was born in the third year of Tianxuan (1136) under the Jin Emperor Xizong, on the third day of the first lunar month, in the year of *Gengshen* (1130).\n\nHis family’s wealth ranked first in the prefecture, and he was filial to his mother, yet harbored an ascetic resolve beyond the mundane. He delighted in studying the *Yijing*, mastering the arts of *yin-yang* and divination. Admiring the *Shiji* Master and *Junping*, he concealed himself in fortune-telling.\n\nIn the seventh year of *Dading* (1167), on a *Dinghai* autumn, Master *Zhuangcheng* (Quanzhen *Zhuangzi*) arrived in Ninghai. Wandering through the marketplace, he observed the Master’s extraordinary demeanor and sought to awaken him. One day, he entered a divination stall where the Master sat with his back turned. The Master said, *\"Please, Master, turn around.\"* *Zhuangzi* asked, *\"Why must I turn around?\"* The Master was startled and awed. When *Zhuangzi* departed, the Master closed his stall and visited the *Quanzhen* retreat in *Ma’s* Southern Garden to pay homage and seek instruction. *Zhuangzi* imparted two verses, and the Master attained sudden enlightenment, prostrating himself in reverence. Though his mother was elderly, he did not immediately embrace the Dao.\n\nThe following year, in the year of *Wushi* (1168), his mother passed away. In the third lunar month, he abandoned his home and ascended Kunjian Mountain to *Yanxia Cave*, where he became a disciple, studying under *Zhuangzi*, who admitted him and bestowed the name *Lian*, with the sobriquet *Tianranzi*. He then rolled up his sleeves, tore them off, and gave them to the Master, saying, *\"Do not grieve for lacking sleeves—you shall perfect yourself.\"* The Master carried an earthenware bowl to beg for alms, and soon after, he left *Zhuangzi* to seclude himself with *Yuyangzi* on *Cha Mountain*.\n\nLater, *Yuyangzi*, perceiving the Master’s lack of resolve in enduring hardship, admonished and exhorted him. The Master then journeyed west to seek the *Sishi* (Fourth Master). The *Sishi* was dwelling at *Zhuangzi’s* tomb, and after completing the rites, the Master wished to reside with him. *Tan Zhangzhen* (Quanzhen *Tan Zhenren*) urged him with the words, *\"Do not follow others’ footsteps blindly.\"* The next day, he returned east, encountering a divine being on *Qishan Mountain*, who renamed him and bestowed his present sobriquet.\n\nIn the thirteenth year of *Dading* (1173), the year of *Guichou* (1173), he crossed *Daregong Pass* and traveled through Zhao and Wei, inquiring into the Dao. In the fifteenth year, *Yiwu* (1175), he sat beneath the bridge in *Wozhou*, motionless and silent. Though the river overflowed, he did not stir. He ate only when food was offered, otherwise he fasted, enduring extreme cold and heat with unchanging composure for six years. His relatives and kin who came to visit received no response, nor did he accept any gifts.\n\nIn the twenty-second year (1182), the Master arrived in *Zhenjing*, delivering sermons in the hall, often attracting hundreds of listeners. Passing through *Lucheng*, he again encountered a divine being, who transmitted to him the esoteric meanings of the *Yijing*.\n\nIn the first year of *Mingchang* (1190), *Gengxu* autumn, he returned to Ninghai. One day, he suddenly demanded paper and ink, swiftly composing thirty-three *Yijing* diagrams as though swept by wind and rain—revealing profound cosmic truths that past sages had not uncovered. The Master had previously foretold *Hou Zizhen* of Tianchang’s fire disaster and appeared in *Renzhou* to *Wang Zhenguo* in a dream, speaking of human affairs—regrets, grudges, fortune, and misfortune—all of which came to pass without fail.\n\nIn the first year of *Dading* (1161), he warned his disciples against preparing his tomb, foretelling his departure. In the first year of *Chongqing* (1212), on the last day of the twelfth lunar month, the *Rui* month, he passed away seated in meditation without illness. His works—the *Taigu Ji*, *Xin Jing Jie*, *Jiuku Jing Jie*, and *Shi Jiao Zhi Yan*—circulate in the world.\n\nToday, *Xiantian Guan* in Ninghai marks the place where he ascended to transcendence.\n\nThe *Yuan* Emperor *Shizu* bestowed upon him the title:\n*\"Guangning Tongxuan Taigu Zhenren\"* (广宁通玄太古真人).\nThe *Wu* Emperor further elevated him:\n*\"Guangning Tongxuan Miaoji Taigu Zhenjun\"* (广宁通玄妙极太古真君).\n\nThe eulogy reads:\n*\"A fortune-teller’s inquiry—turning back was already too late.\nThe earthen hut received the torn sleeves—silence and speech, both Dao.\"*\n\nThe clouds obscure the Chā Dòng Pass, the waters wind around the Stone Bridge.\n*The Yi Tu* in a single scroll—sparse through the ages.\n\n**Xiantian Guan** (清冷散人), a Daoist nun surnamed Sun, given the name **Bu Er** (不二), also called **Qing Zheng Sanren** (清争散人), of Ninghai origin, was born on the fifth day of the first lunar month, *Ji* (己亥), in the first year of *Xuanzhe* (宣和) under the *Song* Emperor *Huizong* (徽宗).\n\nHer father was named **Zhongxian** (忠显), and her mother dreamed of six cranes dancing in the courtyard, one crane flying into her lap. Upon waking, she conceived, and thus the Daoist nun was born. By nature, she was keen and wise, strict in ritual observance. She married **Ma Yipu** (马宜甫) of Shizhou, also known as the **Dan Yang Master** (丹阳先生), who bore three sons: **Ting Zhen** (庭珍), **Ting Rui** (庭瑞), and **Ting Gui** (庭珪).\n\nIn the seventh year of *Da Ding* (大定), during the intercalary seventh month, **Zhang Guolao** (重阳) arrived in Ninghai and constructed the **Quanzhen An** (全真庵) in the southern garden. On the first day of the tenth month, **Zhang Guolao** pierced his ear at the Quanzhen An. The following year, on the eleventh day of the first lunar month, he emerged from his retreat, and the Daoist nun’s husband and wife realized the **Shi Li Shi Hua** (十化之教) teachings.\n\nOn the eighth day of the second month, **Ma Yipu** abandoned his family to follow the Dao. On the fifth day of the fifth month of the ninth year, the Daoist nun visited the **Jin Lian Tang** (金莲堂), where **Zhang Guolao** took the monastic vow. **Zhang Guolao** then presented her with a poem, establishing her current name and bestowing upon her the Dao’s essentials.\n\nThat winter, **Zhang Guolao** accompanied the four Masters—**Ma** (马), **Tan** (谭), **Liu** (刘), and **Qiu** (邱)—to journey through **Kaifeng** (汴梁). The following spring, upon hearing of **Zhang Guolao’s** ascension, the four Masters carried his **Xian Ti** (仙蜕) back to **Liu Jiang** (刘蒋) in the Zhongnan Mountains, and the Daoist nun returned to reside in the Jin Lian Tang, remaining in retreat.\n\nIn the fifteenth year of *Da Ding* (大定)—summer—she entered the West Pass, performing rites at the ancestral Daoist temple. Shortly after, she left the Pass, traveled to **Luoyang** (洛阳), and dwelled in the **Feng Xian Guan Dong** (风仙姑洞), attracting many disciples.\n\nIn the twenty-second year, *Ren Yin* (壬寅), on the twenty-ninth day of the twelfth lunar month, she suddenly bathed, changed her attire, and inquired of her disciples about the hour of the day. They replied: \"It is the time of *Zhuwu* (卓午).\" She then took up her brush and inscribed the *Bu Shuan Zi* (卜算子):\n\n*\"Clasping the fixed, donning the robe to await,\nWater and Fire repeatedly intertwine.\nTen thousand radiant hues arise from the ocean depths,\nOne strike pierces the Three Gates.\nDaoist melodies resound in sequence,\nEver drinking the refined, brewed wine.\nWondrous medicines all come to ask in the blink of an eye—\nThe Nine Refined Elixir is ready.\"*\n\nUpon finishing, she told her disciples: *\"I depart now; each guard and uphold well.\"* Then she sat cross-legged and ascended.\n\nAt that time, **Dan Yang Master** was in **Wen Ding** (文登) at the **Qi Bao An** (七宝庵). Suddenly, he swept aside his robes and began dancing, singing the *Zui Xian Ling* (醉仙令), and saying to his disciples: *\"Today, there is an extraordinary joy.\"* They asked the reason, and he said: *\"Sun Daoist Nun has already ascended today.\"* The following spring, a messenger arrived with news that the Daoist Nun had indeed returned to transcendence in Luoyang on that day.\n\nHer works—poems and verses—circulate in the world.\n\nThe **Yuan** Emperor **Shizu** (世祖) bestowed upon her the title:\n*\"Qing Zheng Yuan Zheng Shun De Zhenren\"* (清争渊贞顺德真人).\n\nThe **Wu** Emperor (武宗) further elevated her:\n*\"Qing Jing Yuan Zheng Xuan Xu Shun Hua Yuan Jun\"* (清今渊贞玄虚顺化元君).\n\nThe eulogy reads:\n*\"Detached from the world, transcending dust,\nProbing the profound, exploring the wondrous.\nSeeking truth in the iron board,\nIlluminating wisdom beyond the rustic fence.\"*\n\nThe Nine Regresses’ merit attained,\nYears of seated oblivion.\nReturning to Penglai’s path,\nLaughing, Sun Daoist Nun collapsed.\n\nThe Golden Lotus True Transmission—\nThe *Xuan Yuan* likeness now complete.",

Ancestor.*\n\n*Passed down through generations,*\n*To Zhong and Lu’s age.*\n*One coin cast, two sages met—*\n*Seven lotuses, rare and bright,*\n*Constellation’s dew, sweet and pure.*\n\n*Honored at

masses,*\n*Never placing myself before them,*\n*Nor lagging behind in battle.*\n\n*In seven years, great deeds were accomplished,*\n*The Four Quarters united under one rule.*\n*This was not my virtue alone,*\n*But the will of Heaven,*\n*For the age’s governance was unstable.*\n*Thus, I received Heaven’s mandate,*\n*Ascended the throne,*\n*Subdued the Southern Song,*\n*Pacified the Khitans,*\n*And all the Eastern Xia and Western barbarians bowed as vassals.*\n*Never in a thousand generations of the Xiongnu state*\n*Has this been seen.*\n\n*Yet the burden of rule is heavy,*\n*And though peace

      "translated_text": "**至元六年正月日**\nBy decree of the **Wu Zong Emperor**, the **Heavenly Mandate of the Emperor of Divine Favor**:\n\nThe **Sanxuan Teaching** was ordained by Heaven, now encompassing all spirits, its five-hundred-year lineage flourishing in the proper order of the age. In days of old, the **East华 Emperor** of the **Taichen Palace** sustained an unbroken lineage unknown in its beginning and end, with **qi** vast and boundless, its mysteries beyond measure. Detached from form and trace, yet naturally so, it brings fortune and auspice without utterance, transmitted to the **August Sovereign**, this is the **Quanzhen Way**.\n\nTo uphold the One, abide in harmony—without seeking, yet without reliance—ascending the **Red Lacquer and Azure Rainbow**, circling the **Tortoise Diagram and Unicorn Talisman**, its law enduring through cataclysm, its successors emerging as **Highly True Ones**. The ancient **Guest Teachers** now manifest as the **Bright and Pure**, compassionate and courageous, supremely filial and chaste, their resolve unshaken before winter’s test. Their words are fulfilled; in matters of assembly, their foresight extends to the warmth already bestowed upon their persons, their sincerity in repaying roots ever deeper. Thus, gracious edicts descend, titles bestowed in proper order.\n\nVerily, when **Divine and Human** harmonize, the **Way of Kings** is balanced—let this be proclaimed far and wide. When **Teaching and Transformation** prevail, governance is established—let this be preserved eternally.\n\nIt is decreed to ennoble the **East华 Emperor of the Purple Bureaucracy, Auxiliary of the Primordial, Founder of the Pole**—let the responsible authorities execute this.\n\n---\n\n**至大三年二月日**\nBy decree of the **Heavenly Mandate of the Emperor of Divine Favor**:\n\nIt is said that the **August Sovereign** expounded the **Quanzhen Teaching**, aligning with the eternal principles of Heaven and Earth, following the great order of Yin and Yang. It began with the **East华 Transformation**, concluding with the **Kaiyuan Bestowal of Green Decrees**, from Han to Tang, producing **Aged Ones of the Age** at intervals. With Jin succeeding Song, during the **Xichao Dynasty**, the **Dao lineage** shone forth, its myriad mysteries unfolded, its foundation in the **Nameless Primordial**. Some attained **meaning beyond form**, nurturing themselves in the **Spiritual Pivot**; others **rode dragons and stars**, soaring in the **Purple Extremity**. Unheard, unseen—though consorting with the **Creator**, they came and went in quietude, yet their responses aligned with the times.\n\nThus, their deeds were recorded for posterity, their virtues praised as **Jade Leaves** of **Original Merit**. Let their ranks be properly elevated, that the **doctrinal wind** may endure forever.\n\nExcept for the **First Ancestor, East华 Emperor**, whose honors shall be separately deliberated, the rest shall be executed uniformly by the responsible authorities.\n\nThe **Zhongli True Lord of Zhengyang Enlightenment and Dao Transmission** may be ennobled as the **Zhengyang Emperor of Enlightenment, Dao Transmission, and Instruction**.\n\nThe **Lü True Lord of Chunyang Correcting the Dao and Warning the World** may be ennobled as the **Chunyang Emperor of Correcting the Dao, Warning the World, and Auspicious Aid**.\n\nThe **Liu True Lord of Haitan Enlightenment, Dao Expansion, and Pure Aid** may be ennobled as the **Haitan Emperor of Enlightenment, Dao Expansion, and Supreme Aid**.\n\nThe **Wang True Lord of Chongyang Quanzhen Transformation** may be ennobled as the **Chongyang Emperor of Quanzhen Transformation and Auxiliary of the Pole**.\n\nThis is entrusted to the **Great Dao Master of the Dao Transmission, the Rectifying and Pure True Person of Concentrated Harmony, Miao Dao-yi**, to receive and execute. Approved thus.\n\n---\n\n**至大三年二月日**\nBy decree of the **Heavenly Mandate of the Emperor of Divine Favor**:\n\nWhen Heaven first formed the **Grass Muddle**, only the **Noble Ones** wove its threads. In an age of **Sagely Prosperity**, the **Aged Ones** upheld and guarded it. In days of old, when our **August Ancestor** established the foundation in the **Northern Lands**, a **True Immortal** manifested in the **Eastern Quarter**, acting without obstruction, knowing all under Heaven, his learning profound, exhausting all scriptures. His urgent priority was to rescue the people from the abyss; his first concern was to clear the thorns of the Dao. Though his self-discipline was strict, his benefit to all was vast.\n\nWhen the **Silken Edicts** descended in succession, the **Cloud-Capped Ones** followed, leading eighteen **Exemplary and Common** souls. Their words encompassed more than one matter of **State and Lineage**; their hearts in silent accord, like **Huangdi’s** teacher **Guangcheng**, their speech concise yet profound, like **Han Wen’s** riverbank meeting. Having achieved success for the **Chinese**, they were entrusted with **Longchun Teaching**. Those who followed in their likeness attained the **True**, thus it is said: *\"May the sun’s brilliance endure, prolonging the **Hong** lineage’s fortune, as the **Present Rectifiers**.\"* To revive the **Dao Gate** anew—all are one in this.\n\nNow, in this time, **abundant rewards** are bestowed; past and present are not two principles.\n\nIt is fitting to advance their titles in posthumous honor, that their **rules** may endure eternally.\n\nThe **Longchun True Lord of Dao Performance and Teaching, Qiu Chuji**, may be ennobled as the **Longchun True Lord of Complete Virtue, Divine Transformation, Illuminating Response**—let the responsible authorities execute this.\n\n---\n\n**至大三年二月日**\nBy decree of the **Heavenly Mandate of the Emperor of Divine Favor**:\n\nAssisting in **One Virtue**, Heaven reveals its thoughts. Seven founders—**the Dao’s practice**—like the **Pivot Star** governing the **Primordial Axis**, like the **Gnomon and Level** aligning with **Divine Instruments**. Whose sons? **Icons of the Emperor’s Forebears**, exhausting the mysteries of **Laozi and Guan Yin**, yet without action, they **self-so transformed**, questioning **Donglai and Xishan**.\n\nSome withdrew into the **dustly world**; others dwelled in **humble walls**. When the **Royal Yuan Dynasty’s** fortunes arose, they personally received the **August Ancestor’s** favor. Their **exalted strategies** unfolded as **salvation for the age**; their **Dao mechanisms** transcended, consorting with Heaven. None failed to exhaust the **depths of teacher and friend**; all had already ascended to the **Dawn of the Celestial Morning**, expounding the **ancient rules** anew, multiplying as **guests in the imperial halls**. Their **profound talents and learning** were inherited—now, the **Divine Chess** is presented. Let their **visible ranks** be elevated to enrich the **True Wind**.\n\nExcept for the **Longchun Teaching Master Qiu**, whose honors shall be separately proclaimed, the rest shall be executed uniformly by the responsible authorities.\n\nThe **True Person of Danyang Embracing the One and Non-Action, Ma Dan** may be ennobled as the **Dan Emperor of Embracing the One, Non-Action, and Universal Transformation**.\n\nThe **True Person of Changsheng Cloud-Water Nurturing Virtue, Tan Chuzhuan** may be ennobled as the **Changsheng True Lord of Concentrated Spirit, Mysterious Tranquility, and Nurturing Virtue**.\n\nThe **True Person of Changsheng Auxiliary Transformation and Illuminating Virtue, Liu Chuxuan** may be ennobled as the **Changsheng True Lord of Auxiliary Transformation, Foundational Mystery, and Illuminating Virtue**.\n\nThe **True Person of Yuyang Manifesting the Mysterious and Broadly Guiding, Wang Chuyi** may be ennobled as the **Yuyang True Lord of Manifesting the Mysterious, Broad Compassion, and Universal Guidance**.",

      "translated_text": "In the third year of the Zhi Da era, the second month, the Emperor, by Heaven’s favor and mandate, issued an imperial edict:\n\n*\"From the sage reigns of Tang and Yu, there emerged the grand patterns for enduring governance. The worthy ministers of Ji and Yi were indeed chosen to ascend to the celestial realm, for Heaven does not create talent in vain, nor does the Dao’s transmission rest upon the unworthy. In days past, the Venerable Long Spring [Zhuangzi] encountered the Sage Emperor, and the divine scrolls were bestowed upon the Eastern lands, while the swift chariot circled in the Western campaign. Whether before or behind, left or right, their resolve was steadfast—soaring above frost and ice to wander the Celestial Purity, their writings illuminated, their jade and zither upright, their rectitude unshaken. Their profound works stood firm, their teachings grew ever brighter, and thus we honor the green-scripted decrees and uphold the ancient red-barrier traditions.\n\nAh! The auspicious dragon and phoenix ascend in their merit, and the crimson realm’s mysteries cluster in the clouds—favors unmatched, their deeds inscribed in the sacred records. Let their exalted titles be bestowed and their glory endure.\n\nLet the officials deliberate on the promotions of the following: Yin Qinghe, Song Pi’yun, and Li Zhenchang, with the rest following precedent. Zhao Daojian shall be ennobled as the **True Person of Loyal Integrity, the Radiant Dao-Master of the Orthodox Teaching**. Song Da’an shall be ennobled as the **True Person of Primordial Clarity, Universal Illumination, and Exalted Virtue**. Xia Zhicheng shall be ennobled as the **True Person of Non-Action, Embracing the Dao, and Substantial Virtue**. Wang Zhiming shall be ennobled as the **True Person of Auspicious Spirit, Dao’s Resource, and Preserved Light**. Sun Zhijian shall be ennobled as the **True Person of Illuminated Sincerity, Embodied Mystery, and Void Tranquility**. Yu Zhike shall be ennobled as the **True Person of Sincere Purity, Restored Simplicity, and Boundless Void**. Zhang Zhisu shall be ennobled as the **True Person of Responding to Verdant Teaching, Exalted Dao, and Illuminating Transformation**. Zheng Zhixiu shall be ennobled as the **True Person of Penetrating Subtlety, Restored Stillness, and Boundless Response**. Ju Zhiyuan shall be ennobled as the **True Person of Preserving Truth, Substantial Simplicity, and Tranquil Response**. Meng Zhishen shall be ennobled as the **True Person of Profound Mystery, Broad Virtue, and Boundless Application**. Zhang Zhiyuan shall be ennobled as the **True Person of Awakened Truth, Concentrated Transformation, and Pure Substance**. Jing Zhiyuan shall be ennobled as the **True Person of Embodied Primordial, Cherished Virtue, and Boundless Awakening**. He Zhijing shall be ennobled as the **True Person of Void Clarity, Profound Stillness, and Guarding the One**. Yang Zhijing shall be ennobled as the **True Person of Piercing Void, Attaining the One, and Mysterious Passage**. Pan Dechong shall be ennobled as the **True Person of Piercing Mystery, Marvelous Dao, and Boundless Harmony**.\n\nThis decree is entrusted to the Great Dao-Master of the Perfected Way, the Rectifying and Illuminating True Person of Concentrated Harmony, Master Miao Dao-yi, to execute accordingly. Issued on the second month, third year of Zhi Da.*\n\n---\n\nIn days of old, the Ancestral Master, the Venerable Long Spring Qiu True Lord, embraced the Dao and cherished virtue, retreating deeply into Donglai. The Founding Emperor, upon hearing of his renown, summoned him from afar to the snowy mountains, bestowing upon him honors most exalted, and thus the Dao’s winds flourished anew. When the World-Conquering Emperor unified the realm, he further revered him, and the Five Ancestors and Seven Worthies were all granted illustrious titles. The Martial Emperor further ennobled him as the **Celestial Sovereign and True Lord**, and the Eighteen Great Masters were universally bestowed the rank of True Person—truly a matchless event in history. Though the peaks of Kongtong resounded with Daoist inquiries and the Yellow River’s banks echoed with sutra debates, who could surpass such splendor in antiquity?\n\nYour servant, Zhi Xuan, born in this prosperous age and unworthy of scholarly robes, recently served as disciple to the Great Dao-Master of Opening the Mysteries, True Person Sun, at the Great Long Spring Palace in the capital. There, I beheld the decrees of the Sage Emperors and, with reverence, transcribed them to share with all under Heaven, that all may witness the Emperor’s profound reverence for the Dao.\n\nOn the fifteenth day of the first month, Tai Ding era, the Purple-Gated High Sage of Clarified Void, Profound Tranquility, and Piercing Illumination, your servant Liu Zhi Xuan, prostrates and kneels in homage at the end of this scroll.\n\n---\n\n**The Primordial Sage, Laozi**\nLaozi, surnamed Li, given name Er, with the courtesy name Qing, hailed from Qu Ren Village, Lei Xiang, Ku County. His mother conceived for eighty-one years and gave birth in the ninth year of Yin’s King Wu Ding, on the fifteenth day of the second month, in the year of *Gengchen*.\n\nAt birth, his hair and beard were as white as snow, hence the world called him Laozi, and he was said to have taken Li (plum tree) as his surname. Through the reigns of Yin and Zhou, he was invited by King Wen to serve as Keeper of the Archives, and after King Wu’s conquest of Yin, he was transferred to the post of Historiographer. During King Zhao’s reign, he journeyed westward into the flowing sands, and by the time of King You, he had returned to the Central Plains.\n\nConfucius once inquired of him about ritual. Laozi told Confucius: *\"A noble who finds his time will ride in splendor; if not, he will walk with humility. I have heard that a wise merchant probes the depths like the void, and a man of virtue, though his deeds are great, appears as though simple. This is all I have to say to you.\"* Confucius withdrew and said to his disciples: *\"I know how birds fly and fish swim and beasts run. The runner can be the leader, the swimmer the net, the flier the hook—but as for the dragon, I cannot know how it rides the winds and clouds to ascend to Heaven. Today, I have seen Laozi—perhaps he is like the dragon.\"*\n\nSeeing the decline of Zhou, Laozi departed. At Hangu Pass, the gatekeeper Yin Xi, skilled in divining by *qi*, saw a purple vapor rising over the pass and knew a sage had arrived. When Laozi, driving a green ox-cart westward, approached, Yin Xi begged: *\"Master, you are about to depart—grant me the strength to record your teachings.\"* Thus Laozi composed the *Dao De Jing* in two sections, over five thousand words, and gave it to Yin Xi before vanishing. No one knows his end.\n\nToday, the Tai Qing Palace in Bozhou marks his birthplace, and the Zongsheng Palace in Zhongnan Mountain, Jingzhao, is where he transmitted the sutras in ancient Louguan.\n\nLaozi is the manifestation of the **Supreme Old Lord of Tai Qing**. Emperor Gaozong of Tang bestowed upon him the title **Supreme Primordial Emperor**, Emperor Xuanzong elevated him to **Most High Ancestor, Supreme Dao, Primordial Emperor**, and Emperor Zhenzong of Song honored him as **Supreme Old Lord, Primordial Emperor of Boundless Virtue**.\n\n**Eulogy:**\n*\"In days of old, the Piercing Spirit, transmitted through twelve generations,\nThe white deer came from the east, the green ox departed to the west.\"*",

His merits exceed the years, and he follows the mighty strides of *Gengsang*. His spirit is concentrated, and nothing is impaired; he embodies the abundant harvests of *Gushan*.\n\nLet him be ennobled as the **Grand True Person of the Mysterious Capital, Supreme Dao, Venerable Literature, and Illuminating Transformation**, and the responsible officials shall carry it out.",

Later, he secluded himself on **Lúshān Mountain** to cultivate and refine his essence, thereafter wandering among the people.

not reach,\nBefore one’s parents gave birth.\"*\n\nAt these words, the Master awakened.\nTheir discussion harmonized deeply,\nAnd the Master invited Zhòngyáng to his home to be his

entrusted all household matters to his three sons,\nThen left home to study the Dao,\nAnd Zhòngyáng changed his given name.\n\nIn the **9th year of the Dàdìng era (1173 CE), in the 10th month of the

**Tán, Liú, and Qiū**—the three Masters—\nThey buried Zhòngyáng’s **ascended remains**,\nThat year being **Rénchén (1174 CE)**.\nThey then renovated the old hut,\nRenaming it **\"Zǔtíng\" (Ancestral Court)**.\n\nIn the **14th year of the Dàdìng era (1178 CE), on the Mid-Autumn Festival**,\nThe Master and the three Masters **Tán, Liú, and Qiū** lodged at the **Zhēnwǔ Temple in Qíndù**.\nUnder the

*\"Quē xián\"* (Deficient leisure).\n\nThe next morning, they parted ways—\n**Chángzhēn and Chángshēng** traveled to **Luòyáng**,\n**Chángchūn** hid in **Mànxī Valley**,\nWhile the Master returned to

      "translated_text": "In the twenty-fourth year, in the year of *Gěngmǎo* (1303), a man named Wén Dēng from Xiàyuán requested that the Master preside over a grand ritual (*jiào*). The assembly witnessed the *Chóngyáng* (Double Ninth) manifestation appear in the void atop a white tortoise.\n\nOn the last day of the month, the Master wandered to the *Sān Jiào* Hall in the city’s north. At that time, his disciples had all gathered, when suddenly, the Daoist Master Wáng Dàoshī of Wéngzhōu arrived, cradling a *qín*. The Master then took up his brush and composed *\"The Return-to-the-Mountains Operative\"* (*Guīshān Cāo*), displaying it to the assembly:\n\n*\"To do nothing is to do all,\nTo know nothing is to know all.\nKnowing this Dao, who would not act?\nActing for this Dao, who would still know?\n\nThe wind sighs, the leaves scatter,\nThe crows cry, flying south.\nAlas, the world turns, days and months flee—\nOld and dying, yet still clinging to delusion.\n\nThe world wounds, the soul longs to rise,\nThe world wounds, the heart nearly shatters.\nHard to end—yet people ask not why,\nPointing to the green mountains, I must return soon.\n\nNight falls on the green mountains, the moon ascends,\nDawn breaks on the green mountains, the moon departs.\nHungry, I eat the clouds; thirsty, I drink from the streams,\nCut off from the world, yet none know me.\n\nWithout knowing, without doing,\nThis heart extinguished, what more to seek?\nSuddenly, twin flowers bloom in the Celestial Court,\nAscending the Three Palaces, wandering the Purple Microcosm.\n\nThis revealed his intent to return to the True.\"\n\nHe then proceeded to Láiyáng, residing in the *Yóuxiān Gōng* (Palace of Wandering Immortals).\n\nOn the twenty-second day of the twelfth month, the *Chóngyáng* Immortal’s birthday, the Master completed the ritual and conversed with his disciples into the night. By the second watch, a sudden storm erupted—thunder cracked, and he told his disciples:\n*\"I now depart for the Hall of the Immortal Assembly to return. Let me be a joyous immortal.\nIf you wish to become immortals, you must strive in cultivation and practice. Even if you encounter a thousand demons and a hundred hardships, never falter or grow weary.\"*\n\nWith these words, he sat upright and departed.\n\nThat night, his spirit wandered to the homes of Guò Fùzhōng and Liú Xī, leaving a verse in each.

      "translated_text": "「The Way returns to withered wood, and the well transforms into sweet spring waters.\nThunder shakes the earth, winds stir the heavens—white clouds drift beneath azure skies.\n\n**Master Zhēng**—surname Tán, given name Chǔduān, courtesy name Tōngzhèng, with the sobriquet **Longzhēn Zǐ**—was a native of Nínghǎi. Originally named Yù, with the courtesy name Bóyù, he was born in the first year of the Jīn Taìzōng’s Tiān Huì era (癸卯三月朔).\n\nIn his youth, he fell into a well yet sat unharmed upon the water, and when he encountered fire, he showed no fear—all marveled at his nature. At fifteen, he took to learning, composing the *Pútao Piān* (Grape Essay), which became widely acclaimed.\n\nOnce, while intoxicated on a journey outside, he fell ill with a wind-induced paralysis. In autumn of the seventh year of the Tàidìng era, hearing that Master Zhòngyáng was accepting disciples, he abandoned his wife and sought him at Quánzhēn Temple, paying homage and pledging himself as a student. The night was bitterly cold, the furnace’s embers crackling faintly, almost unbearable. Zhòngyáng then spread his feet and commanded the Master to embrace them; soon, sweat drenched his body like a meal after eating. When he rose the next day, Zhòngyáng washed his face with the remaining water from his ablutions, and thus his lingering ailment vanished instantly, his beard and eyebrows restored. The Master then knelt and prayed to Zhòngyáng, seeking the Dao’s daily practice. Zhòngyáng revealed a four-character secret formula and gifted him a poem, altering his name to **Dàzhēn Tán Yù** (True Master of Embracing the Way).\n\nIn winter of the ninth year, Zhòngyáng traveled to Biàn (汴), and the Master accompanied him along with disciples Mǎ Yìfǔ, Liú Shì, and Qiū Shì, lodging at the Ráng Shì inn. The following year, on the fourth day of the first month (Regānyīn), Zhòngyáng ascended to transcendence. The Master and his three fellow disciples carried his remains westward to bury them beside Liú Jiāng’s grave, dwelling there for three years.\n\nIn autumn of the fourteenth year, the Master ventured east beyond the Pass, residing at the Cháoyuán Temple in Luòyáng. Later, he journeyed to the Héshuò region, settling at the new hermitage in Jìxià County beside Fǔjūn Temple. One day, while traveling to Wèizhōu, he arrived at dusk when the temple officials, Wēn Liù, spied the glow of fire within the hermitage. Peering in, they saw the Master clasped in flames. The officials, alarmed, sent someone to the prefecture to summon him, but he was still sleeping in the northern inn of the district. Upon his return, the embers had not yet extinguished.\n\nIn the fifteenth year, the Master visited the **Zìzǔ Zhèn** (Second Ancestor’s Abode) in Cízhōu. There, he encountered a drunken man who asked, *\"From where do you come?\"* Before he could answer, the man struck him with a fist, breaking his teeth and causing blood to flow—yet his expression grew only more serene. He spat out the teeth and held them in his palm, then danced and departed. The townsfolk, enraged, brought the matter to the officials, but the Master merely said, *\"He was drunk.\"* Dan Yang, who was then in the central Pass, heard of the incident and praised him: *\"A single punch dissolves all one’s past karma.\"*\n\nIn the sixteenth year, while passing through Báijiā Tān (白家滩) in Shànglò, a farmer had been ill for months without remedy. In a dream, a Daoist practitioner gave him a red medicine, and upon waking, his ailment was cured. The next day, he saw the Master and exclaimed in astonishment: *\"This is the very practitioner who gave me the medicine in my dream!\"* He wished to thank him, but the Master paid him no heed.\n\nIn the twenty-first year, the Master returned westward, staying at the Chunyáng Cave in Huáyīn. He instructed the assembly: *\"In six years, I extinguished all the flames of ignorance. In ten years, I refined the Elixir of Bone Transformation. The boundless void of the empty hall holds no obstruction, and I have already known how to leap beyond the gates of life and death.\"* He then traveled again to Luòyáng, where he found a plot of land near the Cháoyuán Temple and built a hermitage to dwell in.\n\nIn the twenty-fifth year (Yǐsì 四月朔), he instructed his disciples to prepare his burial in advance, then composed the *\"Xíngxiāng Zǐ\"* (Fragrant Incense Song):\n\n*\"A single thunderclap of harmony—\nEmerging light, a thousand radiant dragons meet the swift bolt.\nDiscarding the shell once more,\nSubtle essence bursts forth—\nGolden glow pierces the crown,\nOne nature ascends,\nTo the Jade Pool.\nJoining Dan Yang in his company,\nFollowing his manifestation,\nThe Longzhēn’s profound and wondrous Dao of Non-Action.\nHis radiant spirit surges forth,\nReturning alone.\"*\n\nUpon completing the poem, he departed. A strange fragrance lingered in the room for several days. His *\"Shuǐyún Jí\"* (Water Cloud Collection) circulated in the world.\n\nToday, the **Qīxiá Guān** (Nesting Cloud Temple) in Nínghǎi is his former residence, while the Cháoyuán Temple in Luòyáng’s southern region is the very place where he attained transcendence.\n\nThe Emperor Shizu of the Yuan Dynasty posthumously conferred upon him the title *\"Chángzhēn Yúnshuǐ Dàngdé Zhēnrén\"* (True Person of Nurturing Virtue and Drifting Water in Embracing the Long Dao). The Emperor Wǔzōng further elevated him to *\"Chángzhēn Níngshén Xuánjìng Yùndé Zhēnjūn\"* (True Lord of Congealing Spirit, Profound Tranquility, and Encompassing Virtue in Embracing the Long Dao).\n\nEulogy:\n*\"Seeking the Master in sickness,\nTossing sleepless through the cold snow.\nSpring warms both feet,\nThe radiant Dao ignites the night—\nBurning away cunning and dullness,\nAwakening outside Wèizhōu.\"*",

      "translated_text": "Riding the phoenix and straddling the crane,\nShaking off the arm to the Ocean Isles.\nThe **Chángshēng Zǐ**—Master Liu by surname, **Chǔxuán** by given name,\n**Tōngmiào** by courtesy, **Chángshēng Zǐ** by appellation—\nA native of Wǔguān Village in Dōnglái,\nBorn in the seventh month, twelfth day, on the *Dīngmǎo* year of Jin Xīzōng’s *Huángtóng* era.\n\nHe was renowned for filial piety toward his mother,\nSolemnly vowing never to wed or seek office,\nRegarding external affairs with serene indifference.\nHe repeatedly wished to take monastic vows,\nBut his mother would not permit it.\n\nIn the second month of *Dàdìng*’s ninth year,\nHe suddenly beheld on his neighbor’s wall\nTwo inscriptions beyond mortal reach,\nThe ink still fresh, no name left behind.\nThe final verse read:\n*\"In Wǔguān’s nurturing virtue, the True Immortal’s land,\nThere must be one who lives forever, never dies.\"*\n\nThe Master marveled at the bold, potent strokes,\nYet could not fathom their meaning.\n\nIn the ninth month, on *Chóngyáng* Festival,\nMǎ, Tán, and Qiú—three Masters—came to Dōnglái.\nThe Master went to greet and pay homage.\n*Chóngyáng* turned and smiled:\n*\"Do you recognize the ink marks on the wall?\"*\n\nThe Master then poured out his sincerity,\nBeseeching to be taken as a disciple.\n*Chóngyáng*, seeing his spirit untainted by the mundane,\nSighed: *\"The moon of the pine, the snow of the bamboo—\nThus, I do not receive him from the yellow dust.\"*\n\nHe bestowed a poem upon him,\nEstablishing his present name and title,\nWhen the Master was but in his youth.\nHe then followed *Chóngyáng* to the capital.\n\nThe following spring, *Chóngyáng* ascended in transcendence.\nThe Master, along with Mǎ, Tán, and Qiú,\nConcealed their immortal transformations in Liújiāng,\nDwelling beside a tomb for three years.\n\nIn autumn of the *Jiǎwǔ* year,\nHe abandoned his traces for the capital,\nHis heart ashen, his spirit cold,\nHis body lifeless, untouched by spring.\nHe ate only when given food,\nSpoke only when questioned.\n\nIn autumn of the eighteenth year,\nHe relocated to Yúnxī Grotto in the northeast of Luòchéng,\nWhere his disciples carved a cave dwelling.\nSuddenly, a stone well was uncovered—\nThe crowd was astonished.\nThe Master laughed:\n*\"Not far, just a few feet deeper, there are two more wells.\nThese are the places where I refined myself in three past lives.\"*\n\nWhen dug, they were indeed found.\n\nIn autumn of the twenty-first year,\nHe returned east to Lái Zhōu,\nThe next year settling at his ancestral home in Wǔguān,\nBuilding a hermitage.\n\nIn the second year of *Míngchāng*,\nFùmǎ Dūwèi Bùsǎn, stationed in Lái Zhōu,\nMisled by slander, ordered the military to pursue and imprison him.\nSoon, a market vendor saw the Master in the city’s south,\nConversing with Daoist companions as usual.\nJīngyā Yāzhě Wáng, overseeing the case,\nAlso witnessed him.\nThey assumed he had escaped,\nBut upon checking the prison, the Master lay fast asleep.\n\nThe two, stunned, reported what they had seen to the Dūwèi,\nWho then realized the Master was a man of the Way.\nHe swiftly ordered his release.\n\nIn the *Dīngsì* year of *Chéng’ān*’s second year,\nEmperor Zhāngzōng, hearing of his reputation,\nSummoned him to court and inquired about the Supreme Dao.\nThe Master replied:\n*\"The essence of the Supreme Dao lies in:\nFew desires bring bodily ease,\nLight taxation brings national prosperity.\"*\n\nThe Emperor said: *\"Is this the teaching of Guāngchéng Zǐ?\"*\nHe ordered the Master to reside at Tiāncháng Guān.\n\nThe following March, he received imperial decree to return to the mountains,\nAnd was granted incense—\nHe firmly declined, but the imperial edict renamed his hermitage *Língxū Guān*.\n\nIn the first month of the *Guǐhài* year of *Tàihé*’s third year,\nLiú Zhàoyì, the East Capital’s military governor,\nAnd Liú Shīlǔ, commander of Dìnghǎi Army,\nCame to pay respects and seek instruction.\nThe Master said:\n*\"You are both eminent ministers of this age,\nDeeply honored by your favor—\nI am about to depart.\nI am unworthy to be your friend.\"*\n\nHe then revealed a verse:\n*\"At the towering peak’s height,\nWhat use to linger, when one may turn and go?\nNow I must follow in succession,\nTurning back to gaze upon Xīyī.\"*\n\nThe two officials, moved to tears, read it.\n\nOn the sixth day of the second month,\nDrums gathered the assembly,\nAnd the Master announced his departure,\nInstructing his disciples:\n*\"Each protect the teachings well,\nLest laziness take root.\"*\n\nThen, with bent arm, he passed away.\n\nHis works—*Xiānlè*, *Tàixū*, *Pányáng*, *Tóngchén*,\n*Ānxián*, and *Xiūzhēn*—six collections in total,\nAs well as commentaries on *Dàodé*, *Yīnfú Yǎn*,\nand *Huángtíng Shù*—circulate in the world.\n\nToday, the **Chángshēng Wànshòu Palace** in Luòyáng\nMarks the site of Yúnxī’s Three-Well Grotto,\nWhile **Wǔguān Língxū Guān** is his former residence,\nThe very place where he attained transcendence.\n\nThe Emperor Shizu of the Yuan Dynasty conferred upon him the title\n*\"Chángshēng Fǔhuà Míngdé Zhēnrén\"* (True Person of Nurturing Virtue and Aiding Transformation in Embracing the Long Dao).\nThe Emperor Wǔzōng further elevated him to\n*\"Chángshēng Fǔhuà Zōng Xuánmíngdé Zhēnjūn\"* (True Lord of Nurturing Virtue, Aiding Transformation, and Encompassing Profound Clarity in Embracing the Long Dao).\n\nEulogy:\n*\"Snow-bamboo, moon-pine—\nFar beyond the

      "translated_text": "「His words were strange and uncanny—\nYet the Emperor found them most virtuous.\n\nIn the seventh month, he was summoned again to the Imperial Hall,\nWhere the Master expounded upon ultimate truths,\nAnd the Emperor rejoiced greatly.\n\nThe next day, the Emperor bestowed peach trees from the Upper Garden,\nYet the Master had abstained from tea and fruit for over a decade,\nAnd at this time, he took but one to eat.\n\nHe composed the *Yáotāi Dìyīcéng* (Jade Terrace First Layer) lyric in response to imperial decree.\n\nIn the eighth month, he received an edict to return to his ancestral home,\nAnd was granted a ceremonial farewell,\nBut he declined the honors and declined to accept.\n\nIn the second year of *Míngchāng* (Sinological: 明昌), on a *Xīnwèi* (辛亥) day,\nHe departed eastward to reside at Qíxiá,\nTransforming his old home into an observatory,\nAnd was granted the inscription *Tàixū* (太虚) by imperial decree.\n\nIn the seventh year of *Tàihé* (泰和), on a *Dīngmǎo* (丁卯) spring,\nThe Princess *Shī* (施) presented him with a complete collection of Daoist scriptures,\nDelivered by courier to *Tàixū Guān* (太虚观).\n\nIn the second year of *Zhēnyòu* (贞佑), on a *Jiǎxū* (甲戌) winter,\nWar erupted in Shandong,\nAnd the military governor’s office requested the Master’s talisman to pacify the region—\nWherever he passed, soldiers cast down their weapons and bowed in submission,\nBringing peace to the states of *Nínghǎi* (宁海) and *Dēng* (登).\n\nThat spring, the *Jīn* (金) Emperor *Xuānzōng* (宣宗)\nOrdered the military overseer of *Dōngpíng* (东平), *Wáng Tíngyù* (王庭玉),\nTo summon the Master, but he did not comply.\n\nIn the third year of *Xīngdìng* (兴定), on a *Jǐmǎo* (己卯) day,\nThe Master dwelled at *Lái* (莱) State’s *Hàotiān Guān* (昊天观),\nWhen the region of *Qí-Lǔ* (齐鲁) fell to the *Sòng* (宋).\n\nIn the eighth month,\nThe *Sòng* Emperor *Níngzōng* (宁宗)\nCommanded the great general *Péng Yì* (彭义) to summon the Master,\nBut he also did not comply.\n\nThat year, the *Yuān* (元) *Tàizǔ* (太祖), *Chéngjísī* (成吉思) Emperor,\nWhile still in *Nàimàn* (奈蛮) Country,\nOrdered his attendant *Liú Zhònglù* (刘仲禄) to carry an imperial edict and invite the Master.\nIn the twelfth month, *Zhònglù* arrived at *Lái* (莱) State,\nAnd the Master, moved, accepted the summons.\n\nThe following year, on a *Gēngchén* (庚辰) day in the first month,\nThe Master set out on his journey,\nWith eighteen senior disciples accompanying him.\n\nIn the second month, he entered the *Yàn* (燕) Province,\nResiding at *Yùxū Guān* (玉虚观).\n\nIn the third month, he submitted a memorial outlining his intentions.\nIn the fourth month, he passed through *Jūyōng Guān* (居庸关),\nWhen suddenly he encountered a bandit horde—\nAll prostrated themselves and withdrew in reverence.\n\nIn the tenth month, the Master reached *Wǔchuān* (武川),\nAnd submitted another memorial urging *Hèchā* (何刺) to deliver the edict and hasten his summons.\n\nOn a *Shēnyè* (辛巳) spring,\nHe crossed the *Yú* (瑜) Pass and headed north.\n\nIn the third month of *Rénwǔ* (壬午),\nThe Emperor dispatched the Grand Preceptor *Ālǐxiān* (阿里鲜) to greet him,\nAnd ordered *Zhònglù* to pacify the seas and guard his passage.\nThe *Bōlǔ* (播鲁) *Wànhù* (万户) was instructed to send armored soldiers to escort the Master through the *Tiěmén* (铁门),\nAnd in the fourth month, he finally arrived at *Yìntǔ* (印土),\nWhere he met the Emperor beneath the *Dàxuě Shān* (大雪山).\n\nThe Emperor set up two pavilions before the Imperial Throne,\nWhere the Master was housed for ease of consultation.\n\nOn the fifteenth of the tenth month,\nThe Emperor held a grand ceremonial gathering,\nAnd the Master, seated before him,\nDiscussed the *Dàodé* (王道) of kingship.\nAt the time, the Grand Preceptor *Āhǎi Ālǐxiān* (阿海阿里鲜) was in attendance,\nAnd the Master expounded that temperance in desires was the key to self-cultivation,\nThat loving the people was the way to eternal prosperity,\nAnd that Heaven’s Dao favored life and abhorred killing.\nThe Emperor delighted in his words,\nAnd commanded his attendants to record them in official scrolls—\nTheir full account appears in the *Qìnghuì Lù* (庆会录).\n\nIn the second month of *Guǐwèi* (癸未),\nThe Master declined to return home,\nBut the Emperor urged him to stay.\nIn the third month, he again declined,\nAnd the Emperor’s decree granted his request.\nThe gifts bestowed upon him were lavish and abundant,\nYet he refused them all,\nAnd departed with his disciples together,\nWith the Grand Preceptor *Ālǐxiān* (阿里鲜) escorting him back east.\nUpon reaching *Qíxiá Guān* (栖霞观) at *Ābùhǎn Shān* (阿不罕山),\nThe Master gathered all the disciples of *Qíxiá* (栖霞)\nAnd they all returned together.\n\nIn the third month of *Jiǎshēn* (甲申),\nHe arrived at the capital,\nAnd that month, the Emperor sent *Hèchā* (何刺) to deliver an edict:\n*\"When the Daoist Immortal Qiū arrives in Han lands,\nAny city or territory under my rule—\nLet him reside wherever he wishes.\"*\n\nThe Master’s deeds and travels are recorded in the *Xīyóu Jì* (西游记).\nThe provincial administration requested that he dwell at *Tiāncháng Guān* (天长观),\nAnd from then on, envoys to the Imperial Palace\nWould always inquire after the Master’s well-being,\nAnd the Emperor would invariably send back words of instruction to the provincial administration.\n\nAgain, the *Qiónghuá Dǎo* (琼华岛) was designated as an observatory,\nAnd the Master ordered artisans to construct it.\n\nOn a *Yǐyǒu* (乙酉) spring,\nThe Master broke off a branch of a *lǐ* (梨) tree and gave it to the Daoist recluse *Xuánníng* (玄宁) *Zhāng Qùhuá* (张去华),\nSaying: *\"This is an auspicious sign for a son.\"*\n\n*Zhāng Qùhuá* nurtured it in a jar,\nAnd by autumn, it bore twenty-four fruits,\nFrom which a child was born—\nThis was *Míngchéng* (明诚).\n\nThe *Yánxiáng Guān* (延祥观) had a withered *kūhuái* (枯槐) tree,\nAnd the Master struck it with his staff, declaring: *\"The withered huái shall live again.\"*\nLater, the huái tree flourished once more.\n\nIn the ninth month,\nThe *Yínghuò* (荧惑) star invaded the *Wěi Xiù* (尾宿),\nAnd the pacification commissioner *Wáng Yì* (王揖) requested the Master’s intervention to avert the omen—\nThat very night, the *Yínghuò* star retreated several degrees.\n\nIn the fifth month of *Bǐngxū* (丙戌),\nA great drought struck, and the provincial administration asked the Master to pray for rain—\nAnd the heavens answered with three days of downpour.\n\nIn the fifth month of *Dīnghài* (丁亥),\nThe Emperor decreed that *Qiónghuá Dǎo* (琼华岛) be named *Wàn’ān Gōng* (万安宫),\nAnd that *Tiāncháng Guān* (天长观) be renamed *Chángchūn Gōng* (长春宫).\nHe granted the Master the *jīn* (金) *jīn* (金) *hǔshì* (虎符) seal,\nAppointing him to oversee all Daoist affairs across the realm,\nAnd by special imperial decree, Daoist institutions were exempted from all taxes and levies.\n\nOn the twenty-third day of the sixth month,\nA thunderous rainstorm erupted—\nThe *Tàiyè Chí* (太液池) southern bank collapsed,\nAnd the *Běikǒu Shān* (北口山) crumbled.\nThe Master, hearing the news, laughed and said:\n*\"When the mountains crumble and the pools dry,\nI shall depart with them together.\"*\n\nOn the ninth day of the seventh month,\nThe Master ascended to the *Bǎoxuān Táng* (宝玄堂),\nWhere he expounded upon the matters of life and death to the assembly.\nHe said again:\n*\"Daoist institutions must exert their utmost effort—\nThe physical world is a realm of dust and toil.\nCultivate the inner mind—\nCast aside all worldly affairs,\nAnd each should strive forward earnestly,\nLest time be wasted in vain.\"*\n\nAt the time, *Guāngzhèng* (光正) was unable to find anyone skilled in Daoist matters,\nAnd *Yǐn Zhìpíng* (尹志平) and *Lǐ Zhìcháng*

      "translated_text": "The *Hongfan* inscribed in vermilion serves as the sovereign’s teacher.\nThe jade talisman and golden tiger manifest the Dao and illuminate the age.\n\n**Master Yuyang** bore the surname **Wang**, given name **Chǔyī**, with the courtesy name **Yuyang** and sobriquet **Jieyangzi**, a native of Dongmou, Ninghai. Born in the third month, eighteenth day, of the *Rénxū* year (1142) under Emperor Xizong of the Jin, his mother dreamed of a crimson mist enveloping her body before his birth. At seven years old, he died without illness and then revived, thus understanding the matters of life and death.\n\nOnce, while wandering in the mountains, he encountered an old man seated upon a stone who spoke with him. He also heard a voice from the sky declaring itself the Master of the *Xuántíng* Palace, after which he seemed to grasp some profound truth, though others remained unaware.\n\nClad in rags, barefoot, he sang and danced in the marketplace, and people took him for a madman. When some insisted he was not ill and forced a cap and marriage upon him, the Master refused.\n\nIn the second year of *Dàdìng* (1165), upon hearing of Master Zhongyang’s arrival in the prefecture, he went to greet and pay homage, requesting to become his disciple. Zhongyang renamed him and had him reside at the *Yānxīá Dòng* in Kūnjiàn Mountain. His mother, Madame Zhou, also wished to take the precepts, and Zhongyang renamed her *Rìdéqīng*, with the sobriquet *Xuánjìng Sànrén*.\n\nThat autumn, he attended Zhongyang as he ascended *Wénchéng Lǐng*, residing at *Jiāngshí’ān*. The following spring, the Master departed for *Chá Shān*, while Zhongyang, along with Masters Mǎ, Tán, Qiú, and Hǎo, returned to Ninghai from Wénchéng Lǐng. Passing through *Lóngzhuō*, two hundred *li* from Chá Shān, during scorching heat, Zhongyang held an umbrella, which suddenly flew from his hand and fell upon Chá Shān. The Master found a poem within the umbrella’s handle, along with the characters *Jieyangzi*, and thus adopted the sobriquet.\n\nLater, he resided in *Yúnguāng Dòng* for nine years, his conduct and austerities unyielding. Once, he stood with one foot balanced upon a great chasm, earning the name *Tiějiǎo Xiān* (Iron-Footed Immortal).\n\nRoaming Qi and Lu, he displayed extraordinary divine feats—delivering souls, expelling ghosts, crushing thieves beneath his tread, entering dreams and spirits, summoning rain to shake the peaks, cooking chickens and descending cranes, reviving the dead and reviving the withered. Across a thousand *li*, his renown stirred the age.\n\nEmperor Shìzōng of Jin heard of his name. In the twenty-seventh year (1170), the *Dīngwù* year, he was summoned to the capital. When asked about the principles of longevity and governance, the Master replied: *\"Nurture the essence to preserve the spirit, maintain stillness to embrace non-action.\"* All his responses aligned with the imperial will, and he was lodged at *Tiāncháng Guān*.\n\nTime passed, and envious officials plotted against him, inviting him to drink and then burying him alive. The Master had forewarned his disciples to dig a pool and fill it with water. Upon arrival, he drained the cup in one draught, declaring, *\"I am a poor man, accustomed to begging meals from others. Today, I am fortunate to be invited—let me finish your wine to fulfill your hospitality.\"* After drinking again, he returned, and the pool’s water boiled, though his beard and hair fell out, preventing him from donning a cap. The emperor, hearing this, dispatched officials to investigate, questioning him repeatedly. The Master refused to name his accusers, only saying, *\"I have never wronged anyone; this illness must be my fate.\"* The officials reported his words, and the emperor praised him further.\n\nThe following spring (*Wùshēn* year, 1171), the emperor decreed the construction of *Xiūzhēn Guān* for his residence. The Master requested leave to attend to his aging mother, and the emperor granted it, returning all imperial gifts. That year, the emperor fell ill, and in the twelfth month, he was summoned again. The Master told the envoys, *\"I fear I may not see the imperial face again.\"* On the third day of the first month of the *Jǐyǒu* year (1174), he arrived in the capital, two days after the emperor’s passing. The new sovereign retained him to conduct funeral rites for the late emperor before allowing his return.\n\nIn the second year of *Chéng’ān* (1176), the *Dīngwèi* year, Emperor Zhāngzōng summoned him to the inner palace. Their exchanges pleased the emperor, who favored him greatly. The next day, he was granted a golden cap and purple robes, titled *Tǐxuān Tiānshī*, and housed at *Chóngfú Guān*. That summer (*Wǔwǔ* year), he petitioned for his mother’s release, now ninety years old, to care for her. The emperor granted his request, bestowing rich gifts, and the Master returned eastward.\n\nIn the first year of *Tàihé* (1201, *Xīnyǒu* year) and the third year (*Guǐhài* year, 1203), he was twice summoned to perform rites at *Tàiqīng Guān* in Bózhōu, ordaining over a thousand Daoists.\n\nThat seventh month, twenty-fifth day, his mother, Xuánjìng, passed away.\n\nIn the seventh year (*Jǐsì* year, 1207), he resided at *Shèngshuǐ Yùxū Guān*, where the imperial consort sent a Daoist scripture as a gift.\n\nIn the first year of *Tài’ān* (1209, *Jǐwǔ* year), the seventh month, the *Bóshuǐ Lǔ* official requested he reside at *Huáyáng Guān* in the northern capital. The following year (*Gēngwǔ* year, 1210), he settled in *Yùtián County*, Jìzhou, telling his disciples, *\"Do you hear the clashing of celestial swords from the sky? The northern *qi* is shifting—many will perish from its poison.\"* That year, the imperial armies indeed marched south.\n\nIn the fourth year of *Zhēnyòu* (1216), the people of Wénchéng invited him to *Tiānbǎo Guān*. The following year, on the twenty-second day of the fourth month of the *Dīngchǒu* year (1217), after bathing and donning ceremonial attire, he bowed in all four directions before entering *nirvana* in seated meditation. His works, the *Yúnguāng Jí* and *Xiǎn Yì Lù*, circulate in the world.\n\nToday, *Shèngshuǐ Yùxū Guān* in Ninghai marks his former home, while *Tiānbǎo Guān* in Wénchéng is where he ascended to transcendence.\n\nThe *Yuán* Emperor *Shìzǔ* bestowed upon him the title:\n*\"Yùyáng Tǐxuān Guǎngdù Zhēnrén\"* (玉阳体玄广度真人).\nThe *Wǔ* Emperor further elevated him:\n*\"Yùyáng Tǐxuān Guǎngcí Pǔdù Zhēnjūn\"* (玉阳体玄广慈普度真君).\n\nThe eulogy reads:\n*\"Wondrous Yuyang, his marvels recorded in light.\nDiscoursing on stone, the umbrella flies through the sky.\nIlluminating the imperial throne like stars,\nThe spring pool’s waters boil.\nWith golden cap bestowed, he sheathed his sword and returned east.\nThe Broad-Nurturing Child.\"*",

      "translated_text": "Master Hao, given name Datong, courtesy name Taigu, with the sobriquet Guangningzi, was a native of Ninghai. He was born in the third year of Tianxuan (1136) under the Jin Emperor Xizong, on the third day of the first lunar month, in the year of *Gengshen* (1130).\n\nHis family’s wealth ranked first in the prefecture, and he was filial to his mother, yet harbored an ascetic resolve beyond the mundane. He delighted in studying the *Yijing*, mastering the arts of *yin-yang* and divination. Admiring the *Shiji* Master and *Junping*, he concealed himself in fortune-telling.\n\nIn the seventh year of *Dading* (1167), on a *Dinghai* autumn, Master *Zhuangcheng* (Quanzhen *Zhuangzi*) arrived in Ninghai. Wandering through the marketplace, he observed the Master’s extraordinary demeanor and sought to awaken him. One day, he entered a divination stall where the Master sat with his back turned. The Master said, *\"Please, Master, turn around.\"* *Zhuangzi* asked, *\"Why must I turn around?\"* The Master was startled and awed. When *Zhuangzi* departed, the Master closed his stall and visited the *Quanzhen* retreat in *Ma’s* Southern Garden to pay homage and seek instruction. *Zhuangzi* imparted two verses, and the Master attained sudden enlightenment, prostrating himself in reverence. Though his mother was elderly, he did not immediately embrace the Dao.\n\nThe following year, in the year of *Wushi* (1168), his mother passed away. In the third lunar month, he abandoned his home and ascended Kunjian Mountain to *Yanxia Cave*, where he became a disciple, studying under *Zhuangzi*, who admitted him and bestowed the name *Lian*, with the sobriquet *Tianranzi*. He then rolled up his sleeves, tore them off, and gave them to the Master, saying, *\"Do not grieve for lacking sleeves—you shall perfect yourself.\"* The Master carried an earthenware bowl to beg for alms, and soon after, he left *Zhuangzi* to seclude himself with *Yuyangzi* on *Cha Mountain*.\n\nLater, *Yuyangzi*, perceiving the Master’s lack of resolve in enduring hardship, admonished and exhorted him. The Master then journeyed west to seek the *Sishi* (Fourth Master). The *Sishi* was dwelling at *Zhuangzi’s* tomb, and after completing the rites, the Master wished to reside with him. *Tan Zhangzhen* (Quanzhen *Tan Zhenren*) urged him with the words, *\"Do not follow others’ footsteps blindly.\"* The next day, he returned east, encountering a divine being on *Qishan Mountain*, who renamed him and bestowed his present sobriquet.\n\nIn the thirteenth year of *Dading* (1173), the year of *Guichou* (1173), he crossed *Daregong Pass* and traveled through Zhao and Wei, inquiring into the Dao. In the fifteenth year, *Yiwu* (1175), he sat beneath the bridge in *Wozhou*, motionless and silent. Though the river overflowed, he did not stir. He ate only when food was offered, otherwise he fasted, enduring extreme cold and heat with unchanging composure for six years. His relatives and kin who came to visit received no response, nor did he accept any gifts.\n\nIn the twenty-second year (1182), the Master arrived in *Zhenjing*, delivering sermons in the hall, often attracting hundreds of listeners. Passing through *Lucheng*, he again encountered a divine being, who transmitted to him the esoteric meanings of the *Yijing*.\n\nIn the first year of *Mingchang* (1190), *Gengxu* autumn, he returned to Ninghai. One day, he suddenly demanded paper and ink, swiftly composing thirty-three *Yijing* diagrams as though swept by wind and rain—revealing profound cosmic truths that past sages had not uncovered. The Master had previously foretold *Hou Zizhen* of Tianchang’s fire disaster and appeared in *Renzhou* to *Wang Zhenguo* in a dream, speaking of human affairs—regrets, grudges, fortune, and misfortune—all of which came to pass without fail.\n\nIn the first year of *Dading* (1161), he warned his disciples against preparing his tomb, foretelling his departure. In the first year of *Chongqing* (1212), on the last day of the twelfth lunar month, the *Rui* month, he passed away seated in meditation without illness. His works—the *Taigu Ji*, *Xin Jing Jie*, *Jiuku Jing Jie*, and *Shi Jiao Zhi Yan*—circulate in the world.\n\nToday, *Xiantian Guan* in Ninghai marks the place where he ascended to transcendence.\n\nThe *Yuan* Emperor *Shizu* bestowed upon him the title:\n*\"Guangning Tongxuan Taigu Zhenren\"* (广宁通玄太古真人).\nThe *Wu* Emperor further elevated him:\n*\"Guangning Tongxuan Miaoji Taigu Zhenjun\"* (广宁通玄妙极太古真君).\n\nThe eulogy reads:\n*\"A fortune-teller’s inquiry—turning back was already too late.\nThe earthen hut received the torn sleeves—silence and speech, both Dao.\"*",

She married **Ma Yipu** (马宜甫) of Shizhou, also known as the **Dan Yang Master** (丹阳先生), who bore three sons: **Ting Zhen** (庭珍), **Ting Rui** (庭瑞), and **Ting Gui** (庭珪).\n\nIn the seventh year of *Da Ding* (大定), during the intercalary seventh month, **Zhang Guolao** (重阳) arrived in Ninghai and constructed the **Quanzhen An** (全真庵) in the southern garden.

Shortly after, she left the Pass, traveled to **Luoyang** (洛阳), and dwelled in the **Feng Xian Guan Dong** (风仙姑洞), attracting many disciples.\n\nIn the twenty-second year, *Ren Yin* (壬寅), on the twenty-ninth day of the twelfth lunar month, she suddenly bathed, changed her attire, and inquired of her disciples about the hour of the day. They replied: \"It is the time of *Zhuwu* (卓午).\" She then took up her brush and inscribed the *Bu Shuan Zi* (卜算子):\n\n*\"Clasping the fixed, donning the robe to await,\nWater and Fire repeatedly intertwine.\nTen thousand radiant hues arise from the ocean depths,\nOne strike pierces the Three Gates.\nDaoist melodies resound in sequence,\nEver drinking the refined, brewed wine.\nWondrous medicines all come to ask in the blink of an eye—\nThe Nine Refined Elixir is ready.\"*\n\nUpon finishing, she told her disciples: *\"I depart now; each guard and uphold well.\"* Then she sat cross-legged and ascended.\n\nAt that time, **Dan Yang Master** was in **Wen Ding** (文登) at the **Qi Bao An** (七宝庵). Suddenly, he swept aside his robes and began dancing, singing the *Zui Xian Ling* (醉仙令), and saying to his disciples: *\"Today, there is an extraordinary joy.\"* They asked the reason, and he said: *\"Sun Daoist Nun has already ascended today.\"* The following spring, a messenger arrived with news that the Daoist Nun had indeed returned to transcendence in Luoyang on that day.\n\nHer works—poems and verses—circulate in the world.\n\nThe **Yuan** Emperor **Shizu** (世祖) bestowed upon her the title:\n*\"Qing Zheng Yuan Zheng Shun De Zhenren\"* (清争渊贞顺德真人).\n\nThe **Wu** Emperor (武宗) further elevated her:\n*\"Qing Jing Yuan Zheng Xuan Xu Shun Hua Yuan Jun\"* (清今渊贞玄虚顺化元君).\n\nThe eulogy reads:\n*\"Detached from the world, transcending dust,\nProbing the profound, exploring the wondrous.\nSeeking truth in the iron board,\nIlluminating wisdom beyond the rustic fence.\"*",
